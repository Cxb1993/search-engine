Abstract
The advent of Internet has led to a significant
growth in the amount of information available,
resulting in information overload, i.e. individuals have
too much information to make a decision. To resolve
this problem, collaborative tagging systems form a
categorization called folksonomy in order to organize
web resources. A folksonomy aggregates the results of
personal free tagging of information and objects to
form a categorization structure that utilizes the
collective intelligence of crowds. Folksonomy is more
appropriate for organizing huge amounts of
information on the Web than traditional taxonomies
established by expert cataloguers. However, the
attributes of collaborative tagging systems and their
folksonomy make them impractical for organizing
resources in personal environments.
This work designs a desktop collaborative tagging
(DCT) system that enables collaborative workers to tag
their documents. This work proposes an application in
patent analysis based on the DCT system. Folksonomy
in DCT is built by aggregating personal tagging
results, and is represented by a concept space. Concept
spaces provide synonym control, tag recommendation
and relevant search. Additionally, to protect privacy of
authors and to decrease the transmission cost,
relations between tagged and untagged documents are
constructed by extracting document’s features rather
than adopting the full text.
Experimental results reveal that the adoption rate
of recommended tags for new documents increases by
10% after users have tagged five or six documents.
Furthermore, DCT can recommend tags with higher
adoption rates when given new documents with similar
topics to previously tagged ones. The relevant search
in DCT is observed to be superior to keyword search
when adopting frequently used tags as queries. The
average precision, recall and F-measure of DCT are
12.12%, 23.08%, 26.92% higher than those of keyword
searching.
DCT allows a multi-faceted categorization of
resources for collaborative workers and recommends
tags for categorizing resources to simplify
categorization easier. Additionally, DCT system
provides relevance searching, which is more effective
than traditional keyword searching for searching
personal resources.

1. Introduction
The advent of the Internet has brought not only
much valuable information, but also much redundant
information, leading to information overload, in which
individuals have too much information to make a
decision. Information overload occurs not only on the
Internet but also on personal computers, because
individuals are accumulating increasing amounts of
information.
To resolve this problem, humans categorize
documents, pictures and email to raise the convenience
of retrieval in the future. Tagging means assigning tags
to a piece of information. A tag is a word or a phrase
that is associated with or assigned to a resource for
describing information. A folksonomy can utilize
tagging results classifyinformation. A folksonomy is “a 
user-generated taxonomy used to categorize and
retrieve web content such as Web pages, photographs
and Web links, using open-ended labels caled tags.” 
[28] Tag clouds are frequently used to visualize
afolksonomies. Tag clouds display more frequently
used tags in a larger font, and display all tags in
alphabetical order. Therefore, tags can easily be
browsed alphabetically, or searched by popularity.
Clicking a tag within a tag cloud retrieves items related
to that tag.
Many applications support desktop tagging, in which
users can tag files in the desktop system, and build
personal folksonomy. For instance, Austria-based
Tag2Find [31] has developed an application that
enables any type of desktop file to be tagged, and
which suggests tags based on what the user types.
PHLAT [7] is a novel interface for Windows Desktop
Searching. This application supports a unified tagging
(labeling) scheme for organizing personal content
across storage systems, such as files and email.
However, these personal desktop tagging systems have
the following limitations.
 Only personal tags are maintained, but no overall
tags are supported.
 Users can only find the resource by personal tags,
and cannot reference or view tags made by other
users.
Conversely, many collaborative tagging websites
such as del.icio.us [4] and Flickr [9] are achieving the
benefits of folksonomies by enabling users to tag
bookmarks and images. Collaborative tagging is the
practice of allowing anyone to freely attach keywords
or tags to content [23]. It is most helpful when no
expert cataloguer is available, or too much content is
present for a single authority to classify. Both of these
properties are true of the Web, where collaborative
documents by both user-defined and tags generated
from contextual cues. The Universal Labeler (UL) [15]
is a unified scheme for labeling for organizing
information in the form of documents, email and web
references. It employs a project-centered approach, and
enables users to easily manage resources related to
each level of task structures in a project. User-
Monitoring Environment for Activities (UMEA) [16]
also employs a project-centered approach to monitor
user activities, and automatically add new resources to
projects. User Interfaces for Supporting Multiple
Categorizations (UISMC) [20] enables users to
describe documents with multiple tags, and was found
to have shorter retrieval time and a better user
experience than other works.
This paragraph describes PIM systems that focus on
the second of Lansdale’s chalenges, enabling retrieval 
systems to utilize whatever users remember about their
content. Lifestreams [8] enables searching for personal
content with a particular emphasis on time and the
visual nature of electronic documents. Memory
Landmarks [22] also focuses on time, but with special
attention to personal and public events. MyLifeBits [10]
and Stuf I’ve Seen (SIS) [6] both provide content
search and filtering for various metadata properties, but
focus more on the system infrastructure and
functionality than on the user interface.
Finally, several commercial products provide search
and filtering on properties that go well beyond simple
keyword search for content. For example, free desktop
search tools can be downloaded from Microsoft [29],
Yahoo [30], Google [11], Copernic [3]. These tools
appear to provide excellent performance for retrieval of
information based on keyword search. However,
categorization structures are required to realize multi-
facet description and better search of items.
This work develops a PIM-based system to group
knowledge management efficiency. The personal
information is not just helpful to an individual user.
New knowledge can be discovered by collecting and
computing all the information over a group.
2-2. Folksonomy
Folksonomy was created by Thomas Vander Wal as
“the result of personal free tagging of information and
objects (anything with a URL) for one's own retrieval.
The tagging is done in a social environment (shared
and open to others). The act of tagging is done by the
person consuming the information.” [24] This term is a
portmanteau of “folk” and “taxonomy”.
Enormous value can be derived from aggregating
personal free tagging in a folksonomy tool with the
following three data elements:
1. the person who is tagging;
2. the object that is being tagged, and
3. the tags that are being applied to the object.
Flattening the three layers in a tool significantly
reduces its value for finding information. However, if
these three data elements are kept separate, then two of
them can be utilized to find a third element. For
instance, a user who knows the object and the tag can
identify other people who are using the same tag on
that object. Those people have the same interest and
vocabulary as the user, and they can serve as a filter for
items on which they use that tag. Likewise, an object
can be found using combination of an individual and a
tag.
Folksonomy has some advantages over taxonomy.
First, while top-down taxonomies employ a controlled
vocabulary, folksonomies include everyone’s 
vocabulary, and reflect everyone’s needs. Second,
folksonomies display the up-to-date interests of
everyone, while taxonomies have a fixed categorization
and cannot evolve according to recent events. Third,
folksonomies enable multi-faceted descriptions of
items. Fourth, folksonomies are more scalable than
taxonomies, because they only require many users to
tag a few objects. Fifth, folksonomies enable users to
adopt vague information in search queries, thus
enabling the discovery of unknown and unexpected
resources from relations among tags, objects and users.
A concept space is appropriate for representing
relations among people, objects and tags. A concept
space is graph of terms occurring within objects linked
to each other by the frequency with which they occur
together [25]. Chen et al. have demonstrated that a
concept space is helpful for Internet information
searching and retrieval [12]. Hsieh et al. [26] explored)
the possibility of discovering relations between tags
and bookmarks in a collaborative tagging system. In a
graph of a concept space, terms that occur together
frequently are placed close together.
2-3. Discussion
This section compares features of DCT with existing
PIM systems, as shown in Table 2-1. DCT provides
multi-faceted categorization, which is more flexible
than single-faceted categorization, and more powerful
than UISMC for recommended tags. Additionally,
DCT provides related tag search, which retrieves better
recall results than a pure tag search.
Table 2-1 Comparison with current PIM system
Stop words are words that should be filtered out
before or after processing natural language data.
Such words lack actual meaning, so cannot
represent any documents. For (instance OR
example), ‘the’, ‘a’, ‘and’, ‘what’ and ‘how’ are 
all stopwords. They are removed because they
cannot describe an article. The third step is to
compute term frequency (TF) of every term in a
document. A word with a high TF is one that
frequently appears in this document, and may be
an important keyword that the author intends to
emphasize. A term’s TF in a document is the 
number of times that the term appears in that
document. This count is often normalized to
prevent a bias towards longer documents,
because a term may occur many times in a
document simply because of the document’s 
length. The normalized term frequency gives a
reasonable measure of importance of each term
within a particular document. The TF of term i in
document k is calculated as follow: 

k
k
i
i
n
n
tf
,
where ni denotes the number of occurrences of
term i, and the denominator is the number of
occurrences of all terms in document k. The final
step is to keep terms with high TF values as
keywords. Only terms with TF> 0.01 are kept.
However, if a document eigenvector contains too
many keywords, then the performance of
calculating similarity is damaged. Therefore, if
more than 10 terms have TF>0.01, then only the
top 10 terms are retained as keywords.
 Similarity computation and tag recommendation
module. To construct a folksonomy, the system
needs to identify the case where different people
tag the same resources. The DCT system, unlike
the web tagging system, can simply apply a URL
as a unique identifier, and then the system has to
identify the fact that resources in different clients
are “similar”. Similarity computation is adopted 
to solve this problem. If the similarity is higher
than a strict threshold, then the system identifies
the resources in different clients to “very similar” 
ones to build the folksonomy. The database
server offers tag recommendation when a user
begins to tag a document. First, text in the
document is extracted to derive keywords.
Second, those keywords are applied to find the
most similar tagged document of the document
being tagged in the similarity component of the
document eigenvector. Third, we use the most
similar document’s tags as the query to search the 
tag concept space for related tags. Finally, those
related tags are returned to the user as
recommended tags.
 Relevant search module. When a user sends a
query tag, the server finds a list of most similar
tags of the query tag in the tag concept space, and
then sorts them by similarity value in descending
order. Finally, documents with those tags are
returned.
3-3. System Components
This subsection describes the operations of two core
components. The tag concept space represents relations
between tags based on tagging behaviors. Document
eigenvector similarity denotes relations between
documents based on a document’s keywords and tags.
To construct a tag concept space of tagging behavior,
an eigenvector is adopted to represent a tag. A tag
concept space is established by converting tags into
eigenvectors.
The eigenvector of a tag is given as follows. Suppose
that the entire tagging history contains n documents and
m tags. The tag vector for tag i is Ti, which is computed
by
, if tag i tagged
document j, then tij=1; otherwise, tij=0.
Figure 3-2 Tag vector
matrix
Figure 3-3 Tag concept space
visualization
After the tag vector of each tag is derived, we
present a matrix containing all tag vectors, which is
more easily understood. Figure 3-2 has totally m tag
vectors, each containing n dimensions indicating n
documents.
The similarity value of each pair of tag vectors is
derived. The cosine similarity is adopted to determine
the similarity value of two tag vectors. Thus, the global
tag concept space representing opinions of all users can
be obtained. Additionally, a personal tag concept space
representing one single user’s opinion can be obtained. 
The procedure of acquiring a personal tag concept
space is similar to the global procedure, and is
described as follows.


In the first experiment, nine master students in our
laboratory were invited to tag their academic resources,
including paper and notes. Those students were
proficient at information technology, and had similar
research interests, making them appropriate for a
system designed for a collaborative work environment.
To enable users to tag academic resources in their
computers, they were requested to install a tagging
program onto their desktops, to enable them to tag
documents.
The system recommends some tags to users for their
documents. However, the users were required to tag
documents while connected to the Internet, enabling
the database server to offer tag recommendation. If the
user is offline, then the tagging behavior is recorded in
local machine, but the system cannot provide tag
recommendation. Consequently, users were asked to
tag their documents when they were online, in order to
record their complete tagging history.
The tagging history comprises what tags they use,
what tags the system recommends and what documents
they are tagging. Tagging behaviors of nine users were
collected in two weeks. Totally 226 documents, 514
tags, 553 keywords were obtained from these 9 users.
A document contained 5.06 tags on average. The next
section further analyzes the experimental data.
4.3 Experimental parameter
The similarity threshold value of tag concept space
was set before conducting the experiments. The system
recommends tags by searching the concept space for
similar tags those input. The similarity of two tags is
derived from the concept space. Two tags are regarded
as similar when their similarity value is greater than a
specific value. This threshold value was set at the
beginning of the tag recommendation experiment.
To determine the optimal threshold value, which
should generate) optimal recommended tags, 30 tagged
documents were collected as training data. Additionally,
the system provided tag recommendation when a user
tagged these documents. The threshold value was
adjusted from 0.1 to 1.0. The average recommended
tags and average adopted tags were then determined
under the new threshold value. The results are shown in
Fig. 4-1 and Fig. 4-2.
The system was designed to recommend about ten
tags for a document, because many search engines,
such as Google and Yahoo, list ten results on the first
page. The average numbers of recommended tags were
9 and 15 at threshold value of 0.5 and 0.4, respectively,
according to Fig. 4-1. More adopted tags indicate a
higher recommendation quality. The number of average
adopted tags was higher at a threshold value of 0.4 than
that at a threshold value of 0.5, as demonstrated in Fig.
4-2. Consequently, the threshold value was set to 0.4 in
the tag recommendation experiment.
4.4 Experiment 1-1: tag recommendation
The quality of tag recommendation mechanism was
measured according to two indicators, borrowed from
the precision and recall in the field of information
retrieval. The first indicator was the recall of a
recommendation, is defined as the number of
recommended tags used by the user divided by the
number of tags used by the user. The second measure
was the adoption rate, or precision, of a
recommendation regarding tags given by a user. This is
defined as the number of tags that were both used by
the user and recommended by the system divide by the
number of recommended tags.
An example is given below to illustrate these two
indicators. Assume that a user provides four tags (A, B,
C, D) to a document, and the system recommends tags
(C, D, E).

Because each user tags different numbers of documents,
calculating the average adoption rate of documents in
chronological order of being tagged is not feasible.
Therefore, the documents tagged by each user were

an attempt was made to examine the problem: is it ture
the greater the number of documents in same topic, the
greater average tag adoption rate of them? with N=3.
However, the problem could not be evaluated when
N≥3, because only one combination of three tags 
appeared in more than one document. Obviously, more
tagging data is necessary to evaluate problem 3 when
N>2.

Figure 4-5 Average adoption rate of documents with
same frequency tag pair
The documents in the groups in which the adoption
rate fell was then examined. The inter-similarity of a
collection of documents that shared two tags was found
not to be the same as that of the other collection. For
example, the inter-similarity of a collection of
documents that shared the ‘data-mining’ and ‘decision-
tree’ tags was not lower than that of the documents
sharing the tags ‘acm and ‘pim’. These two tag pairs 
both had user frequencies of 8. Table 4-3 lists the use
frequencies of tags excluding the shared tag pair. The
first row presents the shared tag pairs. The second row
presents the use frequency of tags except for the shared
pairs. The third row presents the number of other tags
in different use frequency groups. The collection of
documents with tag ‘data-mining’ and ‘decision-tree’ 
was found to contain 10 unique tags in 8 documents,
while the collection of documents with the tags ‘acm’ 
and ‘pim’ aso shared other tags. Thus, the inter-
similarity of documents with tag pair ‘data-mining’ and 
‘decision-tree’ was smaler than that of the documents 
with the tag pair ‘acm and ‘pim’. A colection of 
documents with low inter-similarity may have different
features compared with that with high inter-similarity.
Therefore, some document collections that share tag
pairs with higher use frequency may have lower tag
adoption rates.

# of other tags 10 2 7 5 2 1
Consequently, collections of documents with low inter-
similarity were removed to improve the average tag
adoption rate, as shown in Fig. 4-6. A collection of
documents was considered to have low inter-similarity
if the ratio of the total use frequency of shared tags
excluding the shared tag pair to the number of
documents was less than 1. For example, documents
with ‘data-mining’ and ‘decision-tree’ were low inter-
similarity, since 2×2/8=0.5. Documents with ‘acm’ and 
‘pim’ were high inter-similarity, because
2×5+3×2+4×1/8=2.5. The curve for ‘After’ was clearly 
steeper than the curve for ‘Before’. The number of 
collection of documents with high inter-similarity is
relatively smaller, removing all of them and redrawing
the figure caused some points to disappear, and showed
no trend. Therefore, this result is not shown.
Considering only shared tags, a fluctuating but
increasing trend was observed as the number of
documents on same topic increased. The adoption rate
was found to increase steadily after separating low
inter-similarity from high inter-similarity collection of
documents, as revealed in Fig. 4-6. Thus, inter-
similarity is clearly another factor that should be
addressed, in addition to shared tags to determine
whether two documents are related.
Figure 4-9 Precision, recall of relevant search, keyword
search for top 10 tags
Since no obvious trend was observed based on either
precision or recall alone, both factors were considered
together using F-measure, which is defined as the
weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall. The
conventional F-measure evenly weights recall and
precision. This study adopted the traditional F-measure,
because precision and recall were considered to be
equally important. Figure 4-10 shows the F-measure of
the relevance search and keyword search for the top 10
tags. This figure indicates that the F-measures of the
relevance search results were mostly better than those
of the keyword search. The F-measure of seven queries
in the relevance search was found to be at least 0.1
greater than F-measure of the equivalent queries in the
keyword search. Moreover, only two queries had larger
F-measures in the keyword search than in the relevant
search, and the differences were less than 0.1.
Relevant search is better than keyword search
according to the F-measure. The average precision,
recall, and F-measure of the relevant search were better
than those of keyword search by 12.12%, 23.08%,
26.92%, respectively, according to Table 4-3. In
conclusion, the relevance search performed better than
keyword search while using frequently used tags as
queries.

4.6 Experiment 2: Patent Analysis
A practical application for patent analysis was
developed. Patent analysis generally requires a group
of researchers to read and integrate a set of patent
documents in a certain field. The matrix map is usually
made after the survey stage. The matrix map shows the
technical items and purposes of patents in a specific
domain. The matrix map can provide a broad view of
the field, and is also helpful for developing an R&D
strategy.
Figure 4-11 The example of matrix map in patent
analysis
The attributes of a matrix map traditionally have to)
be determined by time-consuming group discussion.
The attributes typically have to be added while the
analysis is evolving. The proposed application can help
without the time-consuming discussion. The system
automatically generates the attribute clusters
recommendation.
Table 4-4 presents the tag concept space of technical
terms. The strongest term pair is “relationship 
identification” and “link analysis”, revealing that the 
tag concept space is helpful for identifying the
technical term associations.
Table 4-4 the associated technology terms
4.7 Summary
Major experimental results are summarized as
follows.
The adoption rate of recommended tags increased
significantly while users were tagging the first 5 or 6
documents, and was then maintained at a steady level.
Thus, tagging enhanced the quality of recommended
tags from tag concept space.
This study has found that more documents in same
topic led to a higher average tag adoption rate.
However, the inter-similarity of a collection of
documents also affected the adoption rate.
Although the average adoption rate of recommended
tags rose as the number of tags collected rose, the
adoption rates of some users declined as they tagging
more documents. The topic of documents being tagged
is possibly a factor in the change of adoption rate.
Experimental results reveal that more documents with
same topic increased the average adoption rate of
recommended tags, but that the average adoption rate
fluctuated while growing erratically.
The fluctuation apparently occurred because the
inter-similarity of a collection of documents that share
two tags and have same use frequency may not be the
same as that of the other data collection. The average
adoption rate grew more steadily after collections of
documents with low inter-similarity were removed.
Consequently, the inter-similarity of a collection of
documents may be another factor for determining
whether two documents are related.
Relevant search is better than keyword search for
queries of frequently used tags. To compare relevant
searching with keyword searching, the F-measure,
which weights precision and recall equally, was
adopted as the evaluation metric. Relevant search
performed better than keyword search when using 8 of
the top 10 frequently used tags as queries. This
experiment confirms that relevant search performs
better job than keyword search in terms of frequently
used tags.
The patent analysis scenario provides a practical
example of a collaborative work group. The relevant
terms become a meaningful cluster to help knowledge
workers integrate all the tag terms that they generated
from their own PCs. Moreover, clustering can easily
identify the evolution of certain area when we address
the information via time period. The various eras of a
research area can be discovered.
5. Conclusion and Future Work
A desktop collaborative tagging (DCT) system that
enables collaborative workers to give multi-faceted
descriptions of their documents is designed and
deployed. A concept space is adopted to represent
categorization and improve search performance. This
section draws conclusions, and lists possible future
work.
Collaborative tagging systems organize large
amounts of information through tagging behavior of
users. The organization of information is helpful for
harnessing the collective intelligence of a large group
of people. The strength of these systems is derived
from searching for relations among tags, objects and
people. Collaborative tagging systems should help
alleviate information overload in the personal
environment. However, collaborative tagging systems
(often OR frequently) suffer from low recall. Such
systems are designed to organize public resources, so
might not apply to personal environments.
Therefore, a desktop collaborative tagging (DCT)
system that allows collaborative workers is designed to
provide a multi-faceted description of their documents.
A concept space is adopted to define the relationships,
since these make such systems useful. A concept space
builds relations between tags, and provides tag
recommendation and relevant searching. Global and
personal tag concept spaces are constructed to reflect
public opinion and personal opinion. A document’s 
features are extracted, instead of using full text, so that

knowledge more quickly and efficiently. Will social networking be the killer
application that will motivate users to take responsibility for their physical activities
and health records such as HRPF (Health Related Physical Fitness) information, and—
more importantly—retain their interest over time? To the best of our knowledge,
there has been no research that addresses the efforts of exploring the impact of
cloud-based health related social networking on physical fitness activities. We are
working on such a conceptual framework to facilitate users to support each other in
continuing physical activities over time, and furthermore, turn users’ virtual 
interaction into physical activities through online social support groups. Hence, the
aims of this study are (1) to evaluate the effectiveness of a Cloud-based Health
Related Social Networking (CHRSN) Service on users’ motivation for encouraging 
greater participation of physical fitness activity and (2) to gauge the satisfaction level
of the CHRSN within this group.
Method
i. Study design
The design was quasi-experimental using purposive participants from National
Taiwan University Executive MBA students in Taipei, Taiwan. Since the participants
were not accustomed to purely Cloud-Based Healthcare Related Social Networking
(CHRSN) Service without any face-to-face environments, the CHRSN was integrated
with a Health Related Physical Fitness (HRPF) Program held at school. The duration
of the CHRSN and HRPF Program was 12 weeks. At the initial meeting, participants
completed a registration form that included information such as background
information and Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q).
During the program, the participants and coach meet once a week and requested
to access CHRSN service to record their self-reported physical activities diary,
maintain health records such as HRPF (Health Related Physical Fitness) information
and support each other’s physical activities.
Before and after the HRPF Program, the participants’ HRPF indexes were
measured. The measured HRPF indexes included information the data of body
composition (body mass index, waist-hip ratio), strength (grip strength), flexibility
(trunk flexion in standing), and cardiopulmonary endurance (step test). Lastly,
psychosocial variables include physical fitness knowledge, body image, self-esteem,
and physical fitness self-efficacy. Satisfaction levels of participants were evaluated
after the HRPF program.
ii. Questionnaire Item generation
The questionnaire items consist three portions, Behavioral Regulation in Exercise,
Comfortable level to share user information in the social networking site and
Satisfaction level at CHRSN website design and evaluation.
The first portion is the Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ)
 Decreased your confidence (Change to motivation of exercise) in
your diagnosis (Change to Physical Activity)
 Not changed your confidence (Change to motivation of exercise) in
your diagnosis (Change to Physical Activity)
The third portion of the questionnaire is to evaluate the Satisfaction and
dissatisfaction for CHRSN website design. We included Zhang and von Dran’s 4
categories and 13 core website design features based on two-factor theory to study
the website usability can be seen in (Table 3).
Table 3. Zhang and von Dran’s Satisfiers and Dissatisfiers: A Two-Factor Model for
Website Design and Evaluation (Zhang, P., and von Dran, G. 2001) 23
Cognitive outcomes (features related to learning while using the Website)
1. High/low level of learned new knowledge and/or skills by doing the surfing
activity on the website.
Enjoyment (features making the Website enjoyable,
2. Presence/absence of use of humor.
3. Presence/absence of multimedia.
4. Fun/no fun to explore.
Privacy (features related to user privacy) and security (features related to
access restrictions to the Website)
5. Presence/absence of access requirement (e.g., pay a fee, sign on, enter a
password, or provide some private info before one can access info).
6. Authorized/unauthorized use of the user’s data for unanticipated purposes.
7. Authorized/unauthorized collection of user data.
8. Presence/absence of assurance that user entered data is encrypted.
User empowerment (features about the degree to which users can choose
ways of surfing the Website)
9. Users can/cannot control order or sequence of information access.
10. Users can/cannot control how fast to go through the Website.
11. Users can/cannot control opportunities for interaction.
12. Users can/cannot control complexity of mechanisms for accessing
information.
13. Users can/cannot control difficulty level of information to be accessed.
Zhang and von Dran investigate Website design factors and their impact from a
theoretical perspective. After examining the work place and the Web environment,
we believe that the underlying goals for creating a motivating Website are similar to
those for creating a motivating workplace: to provide the conditions and
environment that minimize user (employee) dissatisfaction and maximize user
(employee) satisfaction by allowing them to focus on and achieve high task
performance. (Zhang, P., and von Dran, G. 2001) 23
Questionnaires were distributed directly to participants and completed before the
HRPF program start and end of the HRPF program. Individuals were informed that
the questionnaires examined reasons for exercising, would be answered
anonymously and took approximately five minutes to complete. Verbal consent was
obtained and individuals were referred to the instructional set for instructions on
how to complete the questionnaires. Participants completed their questionnaires
before the HRPF program and end of the HRPF program.
