2The S-system model [10] of gene networks is based
on the Biochemical System Theory (BST) – a
generalized framework for modeling and analyzing
biological systems [11, 12]. S-system is a dynamic
model for biochemical pathways, having a good
compromise between accuracy and mathematical
flexibility. The model is a set of non-linear differential
equations of the following form [4-6]:

 
   i=1,…, N, (1)
where Xi represents the expression level of gene i and
N is the number of genes in a genetic network. αi and
βi are rate constants which indicate the direction of
mass flow and must be positive. gij and hij are kinetic
orders which reflect the intensity of interaction from
gene j to i. For inferring an S-system model, it is
necessary to estimate all the 2N(N+1) S-system
parameters (αi, βi, gij, hij) from experimental
time-series data of gene expression.
In this project, we propose an effective optimization
method (named iTEAP) based on iTEA to infer the
S-system models of genetic networks from a
time-series real data set of gene expression profiles
(using SOS DAN microarray data in E. coli as an
example). The algorithm iTEAP generated
additionally multiple data sets of gene expression
profiles by perturbing the given data set. High
performance of iTEAP arises mainly from 1) an
intelligent genetic algorithm (IGA) of iTEA, and 2)
the technique of generating perturbed data sets to
effectively confine the search space of candidate
solutions.
The effectiveness of iTEA was evaluated using
simulated expression patterns with and without noise
[9]. It had been shown that: 1) IGA is efficient enough
to solve subproblems; 2) IGA is significantly superior
to the existing method SPXGA [13] in solving
subproblems, and 3) iTEA performs well in inferring
S-system models of genetic networks from small-noise
gene expression profiles.
The above-mentioned methods often detect
important patterns, but cannot definitively identify the
targets of transcriptional regulators. Moreover,
because of high costs of the experiments and due to
the fact that the investigated processes are too short
and do not allow for more sampling points in time. To
solve this problem of “multiplicity of solutions”[14],
additional data sets have to be acquired like knock-out,
over-expression experiment data or data sets with
different starting conditions that decrease the
uncertainties.
From a given real data set of gene expression profiles
only, it is desirable to infer accurate S-system models of
genetic networks by coping with the problem of
“multiplicity of solutions”. The proposed iTEAP aims to
improve the solutions of iTEA to reconstruct the regulatory
pathway by generating a number of perturbed data sets for
each of real experimental data. Then, we extend the
capabilities of iTEA to predict regulatory pathways by
applying the S-system network to time series gene
expression data from SOS DAN microarray data in E. coli.
The results of iTEAP on the SOS DAN microarray data in E.
coli reveal that 1) the S-system models obtained by iTEAP
can generate high-quality profiles to best fit the
experimental profiles; 2) the performance of using multiple
data sets is better than that of using a single data set in terms
of solution quality, and 3) the effectiveness of iTEAP using
a single data set is close to that of iTEA using two data sets.
III. The results and the discussion
The results of study had been presented in the
below which will be show by figures and tables.
3.1 Material
We employed iTEAP to evaluate the SOS DNA
repair network in bacterium Escherichia coli depicted
in Fig. 2 [22]. The well-known gene network
responses for repairing the DNA after damages. The
SOS system consisting of around 30 genes regulates at
the transcriptional level. The experimental data can be
downloaded from the website of Uri Alon Lab [23].
For the data set, four experiments have been
conducted with difference light intensities (Exp. 1&2:
5 Jm-2, Exp. 3&4: 20 Jm-2). Each experiment includes
the expression measurements for eight major genes
through 50 time points, sampled every 6 minutes.

3.2 Experiment Performance of gPT
We conducted some experiments to evaluate the
proposed perturbation approach. The used parameters
for iTEAP are as follows: population size = 20,
number of OA factors = 7, N (number of gene) = 8,
stopping condition: Neval = 7000 x N, T (number of
time point) = 50, I (maximum degree of regulation) =
5, c1 and c2 (penalty weights) = 1.0, andδs (skeletal
threshold) = 0.1.
In the experiment, the four types of subsets of all
the data from Alon’s four experiment data sets (Expi, i
= 1, …, 4) are list in Table. 1. We generated 14 sets
(M=15) as the perturbed real time-series microarray
data for each 1-set type data (named p-set), where 2%
Gaussian noises was added. For all types with t data
sets (t-set), let M=t in the iTEAP. The values of gene
expression levels were normalized in the range (0, 1.0]

and CCR5. In this study, we aim to propose an effective method
for dealing with the three-class prediction problem.
Using both informative features and an appropriate
classifier is essential to design an effective method for
prediction of HIV-1 coreceptor usage. Besides pursuit of high
prediction accuracy, mining novel and interpretable features are
also taken into account in this study. Physicochemical
properties extracted from protein sequences were utilized as
effective features in recent years. ProLoc [15] is a support
vector machine (SVM) based classifier with automatic selection
from a large set of physicochemical composition features to
predict protein subnuclear localization. The POPI method used
physicochemical properties as efficient features to predict
peptide immunogenicity [16]. The prediction method UbiPred
[17] mined informative physicochemical properties from
protein sequences to identify promising ubiquitylation sites.
In this study, we made considerable effort in investigating the
coreceptor prediction problem as follows: 1) proposing a
feature set of informative physicochemical properties which is
cooperated with SVM to achieve high prediction test accuracy
of 81.48%, compared with existing method [14] with accuracy
of 70.00%; 2) establishing a larger up-to-date data set by
increasing the size from 159 to 1225 sequences to verify the
proposed prediction method where the mean test accuracy is
88.59%, and 3) analyzing the set of 13 informative
physicochemical properties to further understand the
characteristics of HIV-1coreceptors.
II. MATERIALS
A. Datasets
In this study, we established three data sets with different
sizes for evaluating the proposed methods and comparing the
existing methods: Data1225, Data139, Data2class.
1) Data1225. All the sequence data of HIV-1 V3 loop were
downloaded from the Los Alamos National Laboratory HIV
Sequence Database (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/) [18]. Sequences
containing characters that excluding 20 amino acids were
removed from the dataset. The remaining samples have 2,940
sequences, including 2,235 CCR5-utilizing sequences, 383
CXCR4-utilizing sequences, and 322 CCR5/CXCR4-utilizing
sequences.
In order to obtain more general and impartial model, the
sequences were filtered in two aspects. First, we eliminated the
sequences of redundancy. For example, the sequence,
CTRPSNNTRTSITIGPGQVWYRTGDIIGNIRKAYC,
appears in 24 protein sequences with different accession
numbers. To avoid overfitting or prejudiced model, 1,671
redundant sequences were eliminated. Secondly, we removed
sequences which come into conflict with each other. That means
if a sequence appears at two or more categories of coreceptor
usage, we removed the sequences from the dataset. For example,
the sequence,
CTRPYNNTRQSTHIGPGRAYYTTKIIGDIRQAHC, exists
at both CCR5 and CXCR4 classes of coreceptor usage. After
discarding the sequences of conflict, we obtain 1,225 sequences
(931 CCR5, 164 CXCR4, and 130 CCR5/CXCR4).
2) Data2class. The data set obtained from [7] has 1,110
sequences. We deleted the redundant and conflict sequences.
Consequently, the resultant data set Data2class has 507
sequences with only two categories, CCR5-only and
CXCR4-capable. The CCR5-only category has CCR5-utilizing
sequences only, and the X4-capable category contains
CXCR4-utilizing and/or CCR5/CXCR4-utilizing sequences [7].
3) Data139. For comparing the prediction method [14],
which is the first method to predict three categories of HIV-1
coreceptor usage directly, we established a data set Data139.
The used data set in [14], named Data157, has 157 sequences of
three categories. Since the sequences of Data157 are not
available, we collected the sequences according to the accession
numbers provided by the work [14]. Due to the upgrade of the
HIV database probably, some accession numbers cannot find
the corresponding sequence.
Therefore, the data set Data139 has 72 CCR5, 40 CXCR4,
and 27 CCR5/CXCR4 sequences. The statistic of the four
datasets is shown in Table I.
B. Physicochemical Properties
Physicochemical property is the most intuitive feature for
biochemical reactions and is extensively applied in
bioinformatics studies. The amino acid indices (AAindex)
database collects many published indices representing
physicochemical properties of amino acids. For each
physicochemical property, there is a set of 20 numerical values
for amino acids. Currently, 544 physicochemical properties can
be retrieved from the AAindex database of version 9.0 [19].
After removing physicochemical properties having the value
‘NA’ in the amino acid indices, 531 physicochemical properties 
are obtained for the following studies. In contrast to the

binary GA-genes for each individual from 0 to 1;
increase the number r by one, and go to Step 2).
Otherwise, stop the algorithm.
C. Prediction Method APP
The selected m physicochemical properties and the
associated parameter set of SVM by using IBCGA are used to
implement the computational system HIV1-Cor and analyze the
physicochemical properties to further understand the
coreceptors. Since the IBCGA is a non-deterministic method, it
should make more effort to identify an efficient and robust
feature set of informative physicochemical properties in two
aspects. First, we prepare the K independent data sets where
each set is used as the training data set of 10-CV. Secondly,
IBCGA is performed R independent runs for each of K data sets.
In this study, K = 10 and R = 20. Therefore, there are total K x R
= 200 runs of IBCGA. There are total 200 sets of m
physicochemical properties. The one with the highest
appearance frequency of properties in the 200 sets is selected.
The system flowchart of the prediction method APPS is shown
in Fig. 1. APP will automatically determine a set of informative
physicochemical properties and an SVM-model for prediction
HIV-1 coreceptor levels.
In order to provide the analysis of the APP-based approach
on the selected informative physicochemical properties, we
calculate the frequency of the selected physicochemical
properties from the solutions of K x R = 200 independent runs
on Data1225 dataset, shown in Fig. 2. The informative
physicochemical properties were used to determine a prediction
system HIV1-Cor for identify HIV-1 coreceptor.

C. Results of two categories of coreceptor
In previous studies, the prediction of HIV-1 coreceptor usage
is concentrated at two categories of coreceptor, R5 and X4, and
the class R5X4-using coreceptors usually were concluded to X4
classes [7]. Set2class compare the study, which predicting the
HIV-1 coreceptor usage by two classes [7]. Because of the
feature sources and learning method, Set2class was named
SVMaaindex to distribute the SVM method of previous study
[7]. The result was shown in Table III. The 11/25 rule has a
mean sensitivity of 59.5% in detecting X4-capable variants and
a mean specificity of 92.5% [7]. In order to analyzing the ability
of prediction with 11/25 rule, the ROC curve was used to
estimate the sensitivity and specificity of detecting X4-capable
variants and we also computed the areas under the ROC curve
(AUC) to analyze [7]. Considering the 11/25 rule, we fixing the
specificity at 92.5% to analyze the sensitivity and compared the
AUC. Result of SVMaaindex at sensitivity is obvious
outstanding than previous studies and the AUC is also better
than others.
Since the outstanding result of SVMaaindex, we examined
that whether the SVMaaindex is overfitting. We tested the
training model with the independent dataset, including 102
sequences, and the average number of correct prediction is
91.84 sequences (90.22 %). The high correct rate means that the
training model is available without overfitting.
D. Results of three categories of coreceptor
Prediction of coreceptor usage with three categories is a
novel attempt that proposed at 2008 [14]. As a result, we also
classify the data to the three classes and predict the coreceptor
usage. Data139 is obtained from the Data157, so we can
compare directly. We got the K = 10 training/test sets randomly
and each set had R = 20 rounds of K x R = 200 experiment. The
statistic of training model of Set157 and Set139 were showed in
Table IV. Hence Set157 only shows the best result, we compare
the best result and also present the average value. For
independent test sets, we not only show the compared of best
result and average results, but also show the result of sequences
in Table V. Comparing the best data, Set139 had higher
accuracy and MCC at all the classes. Matthew’s correlation
coefficient (MCCi) for the i
th coreceptor class, i = 1, 2, 3, and the
best accuracy and averaged accuracies for all classes:

where TPi, TNi, FPi and FNi are the number of true positive, true
negative, false positive and false negative, respectively. The
average result of Set139 is relatively lower than the best data,
and otherwise, the standard deviation is very high.
E. Results of different ratio of training and test datasets
To compare the same dataset with the different ratio of
training/test sets, Set1225 and Set3fold were used. We also
randomly spilt K = 10 training/test sets and each set has R = 20
rounds of experiment. Results of training sets were showed in
Table VI and independent test results were showed in Table VII.
As showed in Table VII, more numbers of the training data has
