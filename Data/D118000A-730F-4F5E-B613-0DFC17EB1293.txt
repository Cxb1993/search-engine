Abstract
Intercalation of organic guest species into inorganic layered silicate minerals is a way for
constructing nanocomposites with intercalation of polymer and clay minerals. Compared with
smectites, magadiite, having chemical composition of Na2Si14O29‧9H2O and layered structure, is
more suitable for an organizing guest species. By using SiO2．nH2O, precipitated from
hydrolysis of water glass with dilute HCl, as the starting material to formulate aqueous silicate
suspension of NaOH and Na2CO3, the well- crystallized magadiite, as a single phase, can be
synthesized by hydrothermal system at 150C for 24 hrs or at 170C for 9 hrs.
I. Introduction
Intercalation of organic guest species into inorganic layered silicate minerals is a way for
constructing nanocomposites with intercalation of polymer and clay minerals. Compared with
smectites, magadiite, having chemical composition of Na2Si14O29‧9H2O and layered structure, is
more suitable for an organizing guest species (Theng, 1974; Lagaly 1979; Landis et al., 1991;
Daily and Pinnavaia, 1992). It can be synthesized at a lower hydrothermal temperature and within
a short reaction time. Moreover, it has higher cation exchange capacity, and a hydroxyl group on
the interlayer surface, which can react with coupling agents to form reactive functional group,
thus forming in advance a valence bond with the polymer (Shi et al., 1996). Magadiite was first
discovered in Lake Magadi, Kenya (Euster, 1967). The hydrothermal synthesis and properties of
magadiite as well as its transformation and related minerals such as kenyaite (Na2Si22O45‧10H2O)
and makatite (Na2Si4O9‧5H2O) have been investigated by using water-glass solution as the
starting material. Magadiite was precipitated as the first product and then altered to kenyaite at
125C for several days to months (Lagaly and Bebeke, 1983). Muraishi (1983) studied the
crystallization of magadiite in alkali solution of silica gel with molar ratio of SiO2:H2O:Na+:OH-
= 1:100:2-4:0.5 at 100 to 180C. The effect of anions on the synthesis of magadiite was
investigated and the results showed that the production rate and crystallinity of magadiite could
be enhanced by the addition of sodium carbonate (Fletcher and Bibby, 1987). By using the sol-gel
with the composition of 1SiO2:0.28NaOH:0.75PEG200:58H2O at 180C, 150C and 90C for 2,
150C for 48 hrs as reported by Kosuge, our samples prepared at hydrothermal temperature of
150C for 24 hrs show better crystallinity. Figure 3 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of
magadiite synthesized at 170C for the reaction time of 9, 12, 18 and 24 hrs and with the reactant
composition of suspension of SiO2．nH2O /(NaOH+Na2CO3) = 7 and H2O/(NaOH+Na2CO3) =
100. Magadiite could be obtained when the processing time reaches 9 hrs. The magadiite content
increases with the reaction time in the range of 9 to 15 hrs, but decreases when the reaction
duration exceeds 15 hrs. The decrease in magadiite content can be interpreted as the conversion
of magadiite to kenyaite and SiO2. The result is similar to that reported in the previous papers.
However, the phase of free SiO2, which is cristobalite in this study, was quartz as reported by the
others (Fletcher and Bibby, 1987; Kwon et al., 1995; Feng et al., 2003).
When the sample was synthesized at 180C for 18 hrs as shown in Figure 4, the diffraction lines
of kenyaite and cristobalite could be observed markedly, and the content of kenyaite and
cristobalite increased with the increasing of reaction time. Kwon et al. used amorphous SiO2 as
the starting material and they obtained the similar results. At 180C, the kenyaite can be produced
directly and together with formation of magadiite. Figure 4 also reveals that temperature has a
more significant effect on the production of magadiite than reaction time and concentration. In
order to obtain magadiite as a single phase, it is necessary to keep the reaction temperature under
170C. Figure 5 shows the SEM photos of magadiite with a rosette-like shape, synthesized at the
150C for 24 hrs and 170C for 9 hrs, respectively. The diameter of a“flower”and a“petal”are
about 5-7m and 2-3m, respectively.
IV Conclusions
In order to synthesize well-crystalline and single-phase magadiite at a lower temperature and
within a shorter reaction time, SiO2．nH2O precipitated from the hydrolysis of water-glass with
dilute HCl was used as the starting material to formulate aqueous silicate suspension of NaOH
and Na2CO3. The well-crystallized magadiite as a single phase can be obtained by hydrothermal
synthesis at 150C for 24 hrs or at 170C for 9 hrs.

glass with water solution of different HCl concentration. The
single phasic magadiite synthesized is better than that from
the references before.
