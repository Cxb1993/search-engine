to form α-PbO2-type (space group Pbcn) and then 
a Pa 3 -modified fluorite-type with increasing 
pressure [11,12].  The defect microstructures 
observed in the present cassiterite condensates can 
be rationalized by specific lattice correspondence 
and distortion associated with the second order 
transformation from CaCl2 type to rutile type.  
This is of importance to understanding defect 
generation mechanism for analogous metal 
dioxide condensates with rutile-type related 
structures. 
 
II. EXPERIMENTAL 
The tin targets with negligible impurities 
(99.999% pure) were subject to energetic 
Nd-YAG-laser (Lotis, 1064 nm in wavelength, 
beam mode: TEM00) pulse irradiation.  The 
pulse time duration was 240 μs at 10 Hz.  Laser 
beam was focused to a spot size of 0.03 mm2 on 
the tin target inside the ablation chamber.  
Oxygen gas (99.999% purity) at a flow rate of 15 
to 25 l/min was supplied to oxidize and cool the 
condensates.  The input power 350, 430, 500, 
830, and 1100 mJ/pulse per 240 μs, i.e. 4.9×107, 
6.0×107, 7.0×107, 1.2×108, 1.5×108 Watt/cm2 per 
pulse, respectively, assured a good yield of SnO2 
condensates. 
Copper grids overlaid with a carbon-coated 
collodion film and fixed in position by a holder at 
a distance of 2.5 to 10 mm from the target were 
used to collect the condensates. The composition 
and crystal structures of the SnO2 condensates 
were characterized by analytical electron 
microscopy (AEM, JEOL 3010 instrument at 300 
keV) with selected area electron diffraction 
(SAED), and point-count energy dispersive X-ray 
(EDX) analysis at a beam size of 10 or 15 nm.  
Bright field images (BFI) taken by transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM) were used to study 
the general morphology and agglomeration of the 
condensed SnO2 particles.  Lattice imaging 
coupled with two-dimensional Fourier transform 
and inverse transform were used to analyze the 
defects and crystal structure of nano-size particles.  
The d-spacings measured from SAED patterns 
were used for least-squares refinement of the 
lattice parameters. 
 
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 Laser ablation condensation at 0.35 – 1.1 J/pulse 
and oxygen flow rate of 15 to 25 L/min produced 
nanometer-size and randomly oriented SnO2 
particles which are predominantly rutile-type, as 
indicated by SAED pattern of the representative 
sample produced at 0.5 J/pulse and oxygen flow 
rate of 15 L/min (Fig. 1a).  Minor dense phase 
not relevant to this article will be reported 
elsewhere.  The rutile-type structure of the SnO2 
condensates was also identified by 2-D Fourier 
transform of the individual particles as shown 
later.  X-ray diffraction (XRD) trace of the 
condensates accumulated on silica glass substrate 
at 500 mJ/pulse and oxygen flow rate of 30 L/min 
for 10 min (Appendix) indicated the rutile-type 
structure was indeed predominant for SnO2.  
Additional Sn and SnO phases occurred in the 
accumulated deposit with oxygen deficiency, but 
not in the TEM samples with sufficient oxygen 
uptake during condensation.  The (110), (101), 
(200), (211) diffractions of rutile-type 
condensates have strong to moderate strong 
intensity and d-spacings of 0.3366, 0.2650, 
0.2377, 0.1768 nm, respectively as measured 
from the XRD trace.  These d-spacings are 
consistent with the ambient lattice parameters (a= 
0.4738 nm and c= 0.3187 nm, JCPDS file 21-125) 
for the rutile-type SnO2 indicating negligible 
residual stress and impurities for the present 
condensates. 
EDX analysis of the SnO2 condensates in 
TEM samples always showed strong Sn and O 
peaks with fixed count ratio (Fig. 1b) regardless 
of oxygen flow rate employed in the condensation 
process.  In fact, the rutile-type SnO2 
condensates have stoichiometric composition 
based on the counts ratio of Sn and O using 
commercial cassiterite powders (99.9%, Acros 
Company) as standard. 
BFI taken at 50,000x and 120,000x (Fig. 2a 
and 2b) for the representative sample fabricated at 
0.5 J/pulse and oxygen flow rate of 15 L/min 
showed the SnO2 nanoparticles formed both NCA 
and compact aggregates.  The shape and defects 
of the individual SnO2 nanoparticles with rutile 
structure were revealed by lattice image.  The 
rutile-type nanoparticle has well-developed {110} 
facets as shown by the representative lattice 
image in Fig. 3a.  Two-dimensional Fourier 
transform in [001] zone axis (Fig. 3b) and the 
reconstructed image (Fig. 3c) from the square 
region in Fig. 3a showed dislocations with half 
plane parallel to {110}.  Fig. 4 showed another 
rutile-type nanoparticle about 30 nm in size with 
well-developed {100} in addition to {110} faces.  
The reconstructed image of this particle also 
showed edge dislocation with half plane parallel 
to {110} (Fig. 4b).  The {110} half plane was 
also reported for the analogue TiO2 rutile in the 
synthetic condensates [7] and natural occurrence 
[13].  The rutile-type nanoparticles with {110} 
faces tended to coalesce over a specific (10 1 ) 
surface to form twinned bicrystals with different 
diffraction contrast across the twin boundary (Fig. 
5a).  Two-dimensional Fourier transform from 
the square region in Fig. 5a showed twinned 
diffraction spots in [111] zone axis (Fig. 5b).  
The inverse transform gives the reconstructed 
image (Fig. 5c) from the square region in Fig. 5a 
showing a rather high density of dislocations near 
the twin boundary.
