摘要 
流體黏度監測是工業製程分析中一種經常需要的技術，而黏度監測的及時性、準確性、
以及監控的經濟效益，往往受限於黏度感應技術。目前最常見的黏度量測技術早在 50 多年前就
已經開始使用，但幾十年來一直沒有顯著的發展，直至 90 年代初開始才有利用其他如共振原理
發展的黏度檢測裝置，包括壓電晶體黏度感應器、石英膜黏度感應器，以及超音波黏度感應器
(如表面聲波黏度感應器)。這些感應器發展的靈感，都是以偵測共振頻率的改變，或共振曲線
寬度，作為推斷出黏度之基礎。 
本計畫以部份沒入在液體中之振動纖維，來作為有效偵測黏度的裝置。在計畫中利用偵
測直線光源的前向散射光模態，用來檢測纖維微小的振動幅度(< 1.0 µm)。已提出局部纖維在
液體中的振動型態之物理和數學模型，並根據無阻尼模型的分析結果，可以得到系統的自然振
動頻率，也就是所推導超越方程式的根。在引入光纖波動傳播的有效速度下，可以用來找出正
規模態的物理意義。由本計畫也延伸完成由任意數目(材料)元件所組成的一維機械系統之超越
方程式推導，及在正規模態下的解析解。由於超越方程式與組成元件的厚度、截面積、彈性和
剪切模數有關，故使量測薄膜與剪彈性模數的實驗成為可能。此有效速度系統模型，可對自然
振動頻率變化在定性上作出合理的解釋，並有助於其後定量上的預測。 
而由纖維部分沒入液體的含阻尼振動分析結果，在不同種類、不同深度液體測試下的黏
度推導，與實驗的結果相當符合；除此之外，利用數值方法求解也相當一致。此結果顯示：最
大振幅和帶寬之變化和(ρl µl)1/2 呈線性關係，而與液體深度無關。由上述結果，吾人提出一種
可由簡易量測最大振幅和帶寬的變化，而可得到合理準確黏度的公式，並以實驗證實了此方法
之正確性。 
本計畫已發表三篇國際研討會論文及三篇國際期刊論文(一篇準備中)。

As to the viscosity extraction, an analytical solution of the partially immersed fiber vibration 
with damping has been found and results agree well with experimental data in the wide ranges of the 
different liquids and depths. Besides, numerical method for solution of the problem has been proposed 
as well. It has been shown that variations of the maximum vibrational amplitude (MVA) and the 
bandwidth depend linearly on (ρl µ l)1/2 and split over liquid depth. Based on results a simple way for 
viscosity extraction from both the MVA and bandwidth has been suggested and an explicit formula for 
the achievable accuracy of the viscosity sensing has been derived. Experiments have confirmed the 
method of the viscosity extraction. 
In addition to the forward scattering method, a compact fiberoptic viscosity sensor based on 
optical bend loss is also investigated. The sensing principle makes use of the same damping 
characteristic of a vibrating optical fiber probe for viscosity measurement.   
During this project four journal papers and three international conference papers have been 
prepared.

1 Introduction 
Viscosity is the material property which describes a fluid’s resistance (consistency) against 
applied shear stress. Viscosity is also known as liquids internal friction. If static pressure and 
temperature are fixed, the consistency is constant for gases and Newtonian fluids, and is called absolute 
(dynamic) viscosity. For case of non-Newtonian fluids the consistency varies as a function of the 
applied shear stress and is frequently expressed in terms of apparent viscosity. Thus the viscometer is an 
instrument which measures consistency of gases, Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. The details 
about viscosity, Newtonian or non-Newtonian fluids are possible to find in many fluid mechanics 
textbook (see, for example [1, 2]). 
In addition by measuring viscosity one can determinate not only a liquidity of fluids but also 
concentration, size and shape of solids in slurry, color of inks, molecular weight and its distribution in 
polymers, lubrication oils or specific gravity. So own viscosity measurement can also serve as an 
indirect measurement of other properties. There are avaible many designs of viscometers to measure 
those properties in an industrial environment or in a laboratory. The selection of the viscometer depends 
on many factors such as the purpose of the viscosity measurement, required accuracy, the place of the 
measurement (industry or laboratory), Newtonian or non-Newtonian fluids, temperature and pressure of 
the fluids, etc. Viscometers are very often grouped based on their intended use as the ones for routine 
laboratory testing, ones for scientific research study, ones for finished product specification and finally 
the viscometers for in-line process control. Timely, accurate, and cost effective monitoring is often 
hindered by limits in viscosity sensors technology.

Fig. 1. Sketch of the falling ball viscometer 
The idea of the falling ball is successfully implemented at one the most popular in-process 
instrument known as falling piston (slug), where ball is replaced by a falling piston (slug). The device 
can be installed in a tank or a liquid filled line and allows one to measure viscosity of both Newtonian 
and non Newtonian fluids. The measurement can be realized in a wide range of the pressures               (0 
to 2 MPa) and temperatures up to 340º C. For the best accuracy, temperature and pressure are required 
to be kept constant. To maintain reasonable reproducibility of the measurement it needs to clean it 
regularly, piston has to be checked for build up or wear and pressure and temperature should be kept 
constant. And also vibration can cause inaccuracies. Calibration should be performed regularly and its 
procedure is like the one for the falling ball. 
Following family of the sensors, which includes capillary tube, capillary and capillary extrusion, 
allows one to obtain viscosity from knowing the pressure drop in a capillary 
By capillary tube (U-tube) viscometer one measures viscosity by timing how fast a fixed volume 
of liquid passes through a capillary tube; the time here is called efflux time. Namely the pressure needed 
to force the liquid to flow at a specific rate through narrow tube is measured. There exist several kinds 
of such type of viscometer and some of them are presented in Fig. 2.

determined from the flow rate. In one type of the capillary extrusion viscometer the flow rate is 
calculated from the weight of the fluid extruded and the elapsed time of the extrusion. Usually this fluid 
is driven by compressed nitrogen gas and the driving force is measured by a pressure guide. Another 
version of the capillary extrusion viscometer uses air to force the fluid through a capillary tube and then 
measuring the elapsed time for the fluid to travel a certain distance. These viscometers are valuable for 
the study of the materials that are processed through injection molding operations. Many instrumental 
errors usually arise from non uniform shear stress, pressure loss caused by fluid flow and from a heat 
created by shear stress. The temperature control is very important. Calibration or testing is performed 
by measuring fluid with known viscosity. 
Efflux cup viscometers are very similar with the capillary tube ones. But here the viscosity of a 
fluid is determined by the amount of time needed for a certain volume of fluid to pass through the fixed 
orifice. The fluid is driven by gravity and flows into a measuring cup below the orifice. Again the 
temperature control is needed for accurate results. There are avaible several kinds of efflux cup 
viscometer. Three of the common ones are Saybolt (see Fig. 3), Ford, and Zahn, which are very popular 
laboratory devices for measurement kinematic viscosity of oils, syrups, varnish, lacquer, paints and 
bitumen emulsions, although they have some inherent inaccuracies. The viscosity of the investigated 
fluids should not exceed 1.2 Pa⋅s. 
 7 
Other important and widely used viscometers are rotation, vibrational or float ones. Rotational 
viscometers (rheometers) use idea that the torque required to turn an object in a fluid, can indicate the 
viscosity of that fluid. Usually these viscometers determine the required torque for a rotating disk or 
bob in a fluid at known speed. A sensor (spindle) is immersed in the fluid and spun. Then the torque 
needed to achieve required rotational speed of the sensor is measured and plotted. The graph of shear 
stress (torque) against shear rate (angular velocity) yields the viscosity in a straightforward manner. 
Different kinds of the spindle are show in Fig. 4. There are several types of the rotational viscometers 
such as coaxial cylinder, cone & plate and Stabinger that allow one to measure both, Newtonian and 
non-Newtonian fluids. The dynamic viscosity of the investigated fluid can reach 107 Pa s. Besides they 
are able to continuously measure samples for long times and under varying conditions. Frequent 
calibration and often cleaning are main drop backs of these instruments.

Vibrational viscometers date back to the 1950s Bendix instrument, which is of a class that 
operates by measuring the damping of an oscillating electromechanical resonator immersed in a fluid 
whose viscosity, is to be determined. The resonator generally oscillates in torsion or transversely (as a 
 9 
float is sensitive only to flow rate and density changes of the fluid. In viscometer, the flow rate through 
the variable area meter is held constant. Therefore, the position of the float is a measure only of fluid 
viscosity and density or of kinematic viscosity. To increase its sensitivity, the viscometer float is 
designed with a relatively large viscous drag area. For float-type viscometers, the accurate viscosity 
measurement demands a carefully controlled flow rate. Based on their flow controller requirements, 
there are three different types: single float, two float, and concentric. Instruments must be installed 
vertically with the outlet at the top and cannot be applied in case of the pulsatile flow. Calibration must 
be performed regularly and tested liquids should be void of any air or vapor entrainment, etc. The 
operating range is between –100º C to 150º C; pressure can get up to 2 MPa and viscosity of the liquid 
should not exceed 10 Pa⋅s. 
Previous viscometers are designed mainly for Newtonian or non-Newtonian fluids. But there are 
a number of materials that do not begin to flow unless the stress has exceeded their yield value. Such 
materials behave as elastic bodies with shear below the yield value, but will yield increasingly with time 
under greater stresses. This phenomenon is called plastic behavior. Plastic behavior differs for different 
types of plastic solids and at different temperatures. 
An instrument utilized to study such a behavior (melt flow behavior) of plastic materials or the 
molecular weight distribution of polymers is called plastometer. In general, plastometer consists of a 
constant temperature body heating chamber, a mechanism to apply high shear force and a device to 
measure torque or flow-rate of material in detecting the plasticity of the sample. 
Based on the purpose of the measurement a different type of the plastometer should be used. For 
example capillary type plastometer is designed for polymer manufacturing plants; Kneader type is 
suitable for both laboratory studies and control of highly viscous flowing materials. 
It is worse of note that above presented devices for measuring viscosity are based on methods 
which have changed little since their development in early 40’s and 50’s [3 – 5]. As it can be seen, these 
 11 
additional phenomenon arises - reflection of waves from both air-liquid interface and the clamped end 
of the fiber.

The absence of a theoretical background makes interpreting and processing of experimental data 
difficult as well as prevents accurate interpretation of vibrational amplitude spectrums. Therefore the 
purpose of this project is to obtain quantitative data about the influence of density, viscosity and liquid 
depth based on considering the forced vibration of a fully and partially submerged fiber, with a 
complete statement of this problem, to propose a way to extract the viscosity of surrounding liquid and 
based on accumulated knowledge to design new more stable prototype of the viscosimeter utilizing 
forward scattering pattern technique.

horizontally placed laser is incident normal to the optical fiber (core = 10 µm and cladding = 125 µm, 
density ρ = 2200 kg/m3, length = 0.055 m) and results in a light pattern scattering from the fiber. The 
bimorph piezoelectric transducer is mounted on a three axis translation stage which helps one to 
calibrate device and also to adjust the tension of the optical fiber probe. 
 
Fig. 8. Own experimental part of the macro viscometer. 
The acquiring part is shown in Figs 7 and 9 and includes a PIN diode (photodetector) and 
dynamic signal analyzer. The forward scattering pattern variation is detected by a PIN diode which 
receives laser light through a fiber placed opposite the laser to measure light intensity from the 
scattering pattern. The PIN diode converts light intensity to electrical signals that are then analyzed 
using a HP 35660A – dynamic signal analyzer. 
 15 
In previous studies [15, 18] a linear relationship was found experimentally between a relatively 
small displacement (< 1µm) and its corresponding intensity variation from the scattering pattern       
(see Fig 11). 
A series of slowly sweeping sinusoidal input at constant amplitude is fed into the piezoelectric 
driver to generate a frequency spectrum. 
Experiments were carried out in wide ranges of liquids and viscosities. They revealed that the 
density, viscosity and liquid submersion depth impact the amplitude, resonance frequency and 
bandwidth of the maximum amplitude spectrum.

3 Mathematical model 
3.1 Dimensionless analysis and natural frequencies of the fiber 
It should be noted here that in contrast to a string or wires that are used in many industrial 
applications (See for example [19, 20]) a fiber possesses a small bending stiffness EI = 8.127× 10–7 
N⋅m2 [18]. Therefore the term EIUXXXX, which accounts for the flexural resistance of the fiber has to be 
taken into account in common sense. It results in a beam equation with damping. Neglecting the drag 
associated with fiber’s air section, H < X < L, the equation reads 
 ρΣ UTT + θ(H – X)Cf UT +EIUXXXX – FUXX = 0, (1) 
where ρΣ = ρA + θ (H – X) ρl A is the linear density of the fiber that accounts for added mass; H is the 
liquid depth; ρ, A, and L are the density, cross section area, and length of the fiber, respectively; ρl is the 
density of liquid; Cf = (4pi 3f d 2µl ρl)1/2 = (2pi 2p d 2µl ρl)1/2 is the viscous coefficient [2]; F is the tensile 
force; θ (x) is the Heaviside step function. 
One end of the fiber (X = L) is set to a periodical motion U(L, T) = U0 sin pT, while the other 
one (X = 0) is clamped to the bottom of the container. 
Introducing the velocity of the wave propagation over the fiber in air, C = [F/(ρA )]1/2, and 
dimensionless variables u = U/U0, x = X/L, and t = Tf1 ,where f1 = C/(2L) is the frequency of the first 
mode of the fiber vibration in air, Eq. (1) can be written in the following dimensionless form 
 utt + 2δθ(h – x)/(1 + χ)ut + γ uxxxx – {c2/[1 + θ (h – x)χ]} uxx = 0, (2) 
where 2δ = Cf /(f1ρA), c = C/(Lf1) = 2 , γ = EI/(f12ρAL4), χ = ρl/ρ is the added mass coefficient, and utt ~ 
ut ~ uxxxx ~  uxx = O(1). As can be seen, the coefficient γ accounting for the flexural resistance strongly 
(as L– 2) depends on the fiber’s length. Therefore, one would expect that at high L values the term γuxxxx 
 19 
3.2 Forced vibration of the fiber fully submerged in fluid 
3.2.1 Forced vibration of the fully submerged fiber in fluid without 
damping 
Let us begin solution of the problem from consideration the forced vibration of the fiber without 
viscous damping. This problem corresponds to the fiber vibrating in air (lower-bound) and is described 
by the following initial-boundary-value problem 
 utt = cl
2
 uxx, (6) 
 u(x, 0) = ut(x, 0) = 0, (7) 
 u(0, t) = 0, u(1, t) = sin kt, (8) 
where cl is the velocity of the wave propagation along the fiber with due account of the added mass of 
the surrounding fluid, cl2 = c2/(1 + χ) = 4/(1 + χ). 
By introducing a new function v: u(x, t) = v(x, t) + xsin kt, the problem (6) – (8) is reduced to the 
following heterogeneous problem with homogeneous boundary conditions: 
 vtt = cl
2
 vxx + x k2 sin kt, (9) 
 v(x, 0) = 0, vt(x, 0) = –x k, (10) 
 v(0, t) = v(1, t) = 0. (11) 
Expanding the source term x k2 sin kt into a series over the eigenfunctions sin (npix) of the 
corresponding homogeneous problem yields 
 F(x, t) ≡ x k2 sin kt =∑

Let now analyze the behavior of the fiber displacement amplitude with time. Since its series 
converges quickly, it is enough to consider only the magnitude of the instantaneous amplitude of the 
first mode of fiber vibration 
 |A1| = |2 2])1cos[(21 rktrr +−− /[pi(r2 – 1)]|. (25) 
If r ≠ 1, the first mode of the fiber vibration is beating with the maximum amplitude of            
2/(pi r – 1) at the instants of time tm = (2m + 1)pi /(r – 1k). This mode is presented in Fig. 12.

Substituting expansion v = )(sin)(

 into Eq. (28) and initial conditions of Eq. (10) 
yields 
 vn′′ + 2δlvn′ + ωn 2vn = gn sin (kt –ϕ), ωn = npicl, (31) 
 vn(0) = 0, vn′(0) = hn, hn = (–1)n2k/(npi). (32) 
The general solution of Eq. (31) is a sum of a homogeneous problem solution vng of and a particular 
solution vnp of the non-homogeneous one. 
The homogeneous problem solution for the under – damped case (ωn >δl) is of form 
 vng = exp(– δl t) (Cn cos ςn t + Dn sin ςn t), ςn = (ωn 2 – δl 2)1/2. (33) 
Let seek a particular solution with the form X ei(kt –ϕ ). Then writing the RHS term in Eq. (31) as 
gn ei(kt –ϕ ) and substituting both terms into Eq. (31) yields 
– k2X + ωn2X + i2δl pX = gn, or,  
 X = gn/(ωn 2 – k2 + i2δl p) = rn exp (–iξn), (34) 
where rn = (XX*)1/2 = gn/[(ωn 2 – k2)2 + 4δl 2 k2]1/2, tan ξn = 2δl k/(ωn 2 – k2). 
Notice that ξn = Arctan [2δl k/(ωn 2 – k2)] if ωn 2 – k2 > 0 and Arctan [2δl k/(ωn 2 – k2)] + pi          
if ωn 2 – k2 < 0. 
Then, 
 vnp = Im [X ei(kt–ϕ )] = rn sin (kt – Ωn), Ωn = ϕ  + ξn. (35) 
Thus, the general solution takes the form 
vn = vng + vnp = rn sin (kt – Ωn) + exp (– δl t) (Cn cos ςn t + Dn sin ςn t). (36) 
Satisfying the initial conditions (32), the coefficients Cn and Dn read: 
 Cn = rn sin Ωn, Dn = (1/ςn) [hn + rn(δl sin Ωn – k cos Ωn)]. (37) 
Finally, the solution of the problem of the forced vibration with damping can be written as follows

Equation (42) gives the leftward shift of the resonance frequency due to viscous damping close 
to the one for a harmonic oscillator [13, 23]. The table 1 presents the resonance frequency shift of a 
fully immersed fiber for different liquids. As is seen, the frequency shift does not exceed 4 % even for 
high viscosity 52 % glycerin-water solutions (GWS). Hence, it should be expected that the resonance 
frequency shift is negligible for the case of a partially submerged fiber.

Equations (44) - (47) allow one to give a qualitative explanation of the frequency response 
observed in experiments of a fiber vibrating partially immersed in liquid. As either depth or density of 
liquid increases, the effective velocity decreases resulting in a leftward resonance frequency shift. 
Nevertheless the exact analytical solution is required for quantitative determination of the 
normal modes of the system. 
Neglecting viscous damping, the equation of a partially submerged fiber vibration can be written 
in the following form 
 utt = {c2/[1 + θ (h – x)χ]}uxx. (48) 
Initial and boundary conditions given by Eqs (4) and (5) close the statement of this problem. 
Splitting of Eq. (48) yields the following system of equations 
 u1tt = cl
2 
u1xx, 0 ≤ x ≤ h, (49) 
 u2tt = 4 u2xx, h ≤ x < 1, (50) 
with boundary conditions:
 
 u1(0, t) = 0, u2(1, t) = sin kt,  (51) 
and matching conditions:  
 u1(h, t) = u2(h, t), u1x(h, t) = u2x(h, t). (52) 
By using the same substitution as in case of fully submerged fiber’s vibration, one would arrive 
at the following heterogeneous problem with homogeneous boundary conditions: 
 v1tt = cl

 v1xx + x k2 sin kt, (53) 
 v2tt = 4 v2xx + x k2 sin kt, (54)

3.3.2 Forced vibration of the partially submerged fiber in fluid 
As was shown in Sec. 3.2.2., the impact of viscous damping on the resonance frequency shift is 
too small to use it for extraction of viscosity values. At the same time the bandwidth and the MVA

the initial and boundary conditions given by Eqs. (4) - (5) close the statement of the problem. 
The space interval [0, 1] is divided into N sublayers with a uniform space step ∆x. The number 
of sublayers of the immersed part of the fiber [0, h] is designated as K. The K and N is related by the 
relationship K/N = h. The subscript i corresponds to the center of a control volume and the subscripts     
i ± 1/2 correspond to its boundaries. The time step was chosen from the Courant - Friedrichs- Lewy 
condition Co = 2∆t/∆x < 1. 
Integrating Eqs. (76) and (77) over the spatial - temporal volume (xi – 1/2, xi + 1/2)×(tj, tj + 1) with 
taking into account boundary and matching conditions, Eqs. (5) and (78) yields the following system of 
finite difference equations: 
for inner volumes  
(1 + 2δl ∆t) u1i j+1 – 2(1 + δl ∆t – Col 2) u1i j – Col 2 (u1i+1 j + u1i–1 j) + u1i  j–1 = 0, i = 2,…, K – 1, (79)

where Col = cl∆t/∆x; 
for boundaries volumes (i = 1 and i = N) 
(1 + 2δl ∆t) u11 j+1 – 2(1 + δl ∆t – 1.5Col 2)u11 j – Col 2u12 j + u11  j–1 = 0, (81)

for conjugate volumes (i = K and i = K+ 1)

Writing the backward and forward difference approximation for u1K and u2K + 1 at point K + 1/2, 
and applying the matching conditions given by Eq. (78) yield

Since measurements are doing in air above the liquid at t >> 1/δa, hence it is enough to find an 
inverse Laplace transform of Eq. (93) only for a quasi - steady part of the solution represented by 
simple poles ± ip. 
Using Mellin’s inversion formula and Cauchy’s residue theorem [26 - 27], the solution can be 
written as follows:

Coefficients Ai and Bi are roots of the following equation (Ai + i Bi)2 = – p + i 2δip. 
The residue of Eq. (95) can be computed by using the trigonometric identities: cosh(A + iB) =   
cosh A cos B + i sinh A sin B and sinh (A + iB) = sinh A cos B – i cosh A sin B. Omitting cumbersome

Fig. 15. Comparison of an exact analytical solution and numerical computations for partially submerged 
fiber in the DI water of depth h = 0.05. 
The computations were carried out in wide ranges of liquid depths and viscosities. As an 
example, Fig. 16 (a, b) displays analytical predictions of resonance curves for DI water of different 
depths along with experimental data. As is seen from Fig. 16 (a, b), analytical predictions for the 
vibrational amplitude and power (– 3 dB) bandwidth are close to those from an experiment. 
Experiments and analytical results have shown that both the MVA and bandwidth are very sensitive to 
viscosity changes. This allows one to use analytical predictions of the vibrational amplitude and 
bandwidth to extract the viscosity.

for h = 0.16. 
As is seen from Eq. (105), the accuracy of the viscosity measurement is proportional to the y 
value and depends essentially on the slope as a–2. As example the calculations by Eq. (105) for cases 
from Figs. 17 and 18 are listed in Table. 3. 
Very important conclusions can be drawn from Table 3: 1) at the fixed instrumental error        
(δy = constant) and liquid depth (a = constant), the accuracy δµl is about two times for bandwidth (three 
times for amplitude) higher for low viscous liquids than for high viscous ones; 2) for bandwidth, 
increase of the dimensionless liquid depth from 0.09 to 0.16 at fixed δy results in an essential (more 
than 6 times) increase of accuracy, at the same time δµl changes slightly for amplitude.

5 Normal modes of vibrating one-dimensional mechanical 
systems with piecewise constant mechanical properties 
In this chapter an analytical solution obtained previously in Sec. 3.3.1. by the method of the 
eigenfunctions expansion for the vibration of the partially submerged fiber is generalized for the case of 
an arbitrary number of layers with piecewise constant properties. A new theoretical approach has been 
put forward allowing one to get the transcendental equation, which roots are the normal modes of the 
vibrating system, directly from the Laplace transform image space. 
5.1 Statement of the problem for the N – steps function 
This analysis starts with a one-dimensional system (rod, shaft or string) of length L consisting of 
N homogeneous parts with different properties. An N-step function fN(X) can be represented as 
 fN(X) = ),,(rect 1
1
ii
N
i
i XXXf −
=
∑ , (106) 
where rect(X, a, b) = θ(X–a)θ(b–X) is a rectangular window on the interval (a, b), θ(X) is the unit step 
function, X0 = 0, XN  = L and  fi is the amplitude on an interval (Xi–1, Xi). 
Then a differential equation describing the system oscillations can be written as 
 ρN(X)UTT = FN (X)UXX. (107) 
In case of longitudinal vibrations of a rod, ρN(X) and FN (X) ≡ EN(X) are the density and Young’s 
modulus distributions over the rod; in case of torsional oscillations, ρN(X) and FN (X) ≡ GN(X) are the 
density and shear modulus distributions over the rod, and in case of string immersed in N-layers pie of 
immiscible liquids, FN (X) = constant is the string tension, ρN(X) is the linear density of the string with 
due account of added mass. 
Splitting Eq. (107) into N equations with constant coefficients yields  
 47 
Accounting for matching and boundary conditions (114), (115) yields the solution in the 
imaginary space: 
 Ũ1(X, s) = χκ2κ3 sinh (sX/C1)/d(s), (116) 
 Ũ2(X, s) = χ{κ1κ3 cosh (sH1/c1) sinh [s(X – H1)/C2] +  (117) 
 + κ2κ3 sinh (sH1/C1)  cosh [s(X – H1)/C2]}/d(s),  
 Ũ3(X, s) = χ{κ1κ3 cosh (sH1/C1) sinh [s(H2 – H1)/C2] cosh [s(X – H2)/C3] +  (118) 
 + κ2κ3 sinh (sH1/C1) cosh [s(H2 – H1)/C2] cosh [s(X – H2)/C3] +  
+ κ1κ2 cosh (sH1/C1) cosh [s(H2 – H1)/C2] sinh [s(X – H2)/C3] +  
+ κ2
2
 sinh (sH1/C1) sinh [s(H2 – H1)/C2] sinh [s(X – H2)C3]}/d(s),  
where κi = ki/Ci, and d(s) = κ1κ3 cosh (sH1/C1) sinh [s(H2 – H1)/C2] cosh [s(L – H2)/C3] +  
+ κ2κ3 sinh (sH1/C1) cosh [s(H2 – H1)/C2] cosh [s(L – H2)/C3] +  
+ κ1κ2 cosh (sH1/C1) cosh [s(H2 – H1)/C2] sinh [s(L – H2)/C3] +  
+ κ2
2
 sinh (sH1/C1) sinh [s(H2 – H1)/C2] sinh [s(L – H2)/C3]. 
It can be seen from Eqs. (116) – (118) that all Ũi(X, s) have a common denominator E(s) of the 
form 
 E(s) = χ d(s). (119) 
The function E(s) has two zeros ± ip and a countable set of zeros given by transcendental 
equation d(s) = 0. All zeros of E(s) are simple poles of Ũi, hence the inverse transform can be performed 
by integrating the function (2pi)–1Ũiest over the closed contour CR ∪[σ –iR, σ + iR] (CR is a semicircle of 
radius R and the line [σ –iR, σ + iR] is chosen so as to lie to the right of all the poles) at R → ∞ and 
applying Cauchy’s residue theorem [26]. In order to find the natural frequencies it is unnecessary to 
perform an inverse Laplace transform. Notice that poles ± ip correspond to the angular frequency of the 
external force. But if the frequency of external force coincides with a root sn of transcendental equation

From Eq. (122) it follows that in case of the N-steps function the transcendental equation 
comprises 2N – 1 terms. The roots of Eq. (122) are the angular fundamental frequencies of the 
mechanical system with N-piecewise constant properties. 
This makes finding the roots of Eq. (122) difficult for higher N. To circumvent this problem and 
find out the physical sense of the natural frequencies of such heterogeneous systems, it would be well to 
introduce an effective wave velocity model.  
5.4 An effective model for the normal modes 
The effective model of the speed of propagation for and arbitrary number of the piecewise 
constant mechanical properties follows the approach given in Section 3.1.1., where the model has been 
introduced for fiber partially submerged in fluid.

6 Results and discussion 
Analytical and numerical analyses of the modes of the viscometer optical fiber vibration for the 
fully and partially immersed fiber have been carried out. The initial quasilinear equation with 
discontinuous coefficients, which describes the vibration of optical fiber partially immersed in liquid, is 
reduced to two telegraph equations with the constant coefficients. The analytical solutions for fully 
submerged fiber with damping and partially submerged fiber without damping have been found. A 
model of “effective” velocity of the perturbation propagation has been put forward. This model gives a 
simple qualitative explanation of the leftward resonance frequency shift with increase of the sample 
fluid height and agrees well with experimental and analytical results quantitatively. 
A numerical code for solution of the partially immersed fiber has been developed. The obtained 
results allows one to extract the decrement from the resonance curve and, thereby, to determine the 
viscosity of the sample liquid with high accuracy.  
A mathematical model for the new variant of viscometer with free-fixed fiber has been put 
forward. An analytical solution of the vibration of a free-fixed fiber loaded with a point heavy mass has 
been obtained.  
An analytical solution obtained previously by the method of the eigenfunctions expansion for 
the vibration of the partially submerged fiber was generalized for the case of 3 layers with piecewise 
constant properties. A new theoretical approach has been put forward allowing one to get the 
transcendental equation, the roots of which are the angular frequencies of the vibrating system, directly 
from the inverse Laplace transform. Based on theoretical results an optical method utilizing a forward 
light scattering pattern has been modified to improve the sensitivity and to eliminate the vices. It was 
proven variations of the MVA and the bandwidth can be presented by the linear functions of the 
coordinate (ρlµl)1/2. It allows one to suggest a simple way for viscosity extraction from both the MVA

7 Viscosity Measurement using Fiberoptic bendloss Sensor  
There has been some new development in compact micro viscosity sensors. However piezo-
electric resonators have been the dominant technique [29-34]. Among them, surface acoustic wave 
devices have received considerable attention for their versatility and sensitivity as gas phase sensors 
[29-31]. Piezoelectric resonators have been proven to be highly sensitive and mobile, the same level of 
sensitivity and mobility exhibited by the piezoelectric sensors can however be achieved with the 
relatively simpler and inexpensive fiber optics technology which has been shown by Wang et al by 
using fix-fix end optical fiber sensors [35-39] and some of the later work as reported in previous six 
chapters.. In this final chapte of the report, we will present a more recent development of using a 
cantilever fiberoptic bend loss sensor for measuring liquid viscosity. The new fix-free fiber 
configuration and use of an intrinsic optical detection technique provides a potential compact portable 
system. 
7.1 Sensor Principle 
 
 Bend loss of the fiber provide a unique property which can be utilized to measure the displacement of 
the fiber structure, because the bending and non-bending fiber creates a variance of light intensity which 
provide the information on how much bending the fiber is subjected to. 
 The principle of bend loss theory [42, 43] is that by increasing the incident angle of light beam at core-
cladding interface (Fig 1), the light beam traveling closed to the bend region will likely escape into the cladding 
region due to the bending. The relation between the bending radius and the light loss can be formulated as 
follows  
             (1) 
Where C1 and C2 and are constants that depend on the dimensions of the fiber and on the shape of the modal 
fields, R and is the radius of curvature of the fiber during bending.  
 55 
 
Fig. 2 shows the linear relationship between amplitude of displacement and the amplitude of the light 
intensity variance. The value of both the displacement and light intensity are normalized with respect to 
the driving voltage of 21V at 400Hz and the light intensity in decibels. 
 
 An important phenomenon in measuring the displacement of the probe is that each time a 
probe has traveled a cycle as shown in Figure 3, the light intensity varied twice. In this case, the output 
frequency will be twice the input frequency of the piezoelectric strip. 
 
 
 
 
 
(a)        (b) 
Fig 3 (a) light intensity has a maximum value when the fiber is not bent but it reaches a minimum value 
when the fiber is bent the most. (b) Each time the probe completes a cycle (the probe travels from a 
starting point and returns to that point), a signal double the initial driving frequency is produced. 
 57 
piezoelectric strip, the displacement of the piezoelectric strip is first measured by laser vibrometer 
(Polytec OFV302 and OFV2600H-KU, Germany) and then the corresponding natural frequency of the 
fiber may be determined. The first and second resonances of the piezoelectric strip were determined to 
be at 110HZ and 610HZ respectively. 
 
 
Figure 4 shows that the light from He-Ne laser passes through the coupler and 2-by-1 optical coupler 
and reaches the tip of the probe where it is reflected. The photo-detector is used to receive the light 
signal and convert it to a signal. The voltage signal is then analyzed by backside electronics. The 
immersion depth of the fiber probe is controlled by the height of the vertical stage. 
7.2.1 Probe Length 
 The length of the probe is an important parameter in measuring the displacement. Long 
length probe will bring the frequency response to a lower region and result in measuring more noise 
from the environment and surrounding structure. On the other hand, short length probe requires high 
driving frequency which will increase the drag force acting on the probe when immersed in the fluid 
 59 
stage (Mitutoyo) is used to raise the fluid reservoir as shown in figure 4. After the fluid surface touch 
the probe, the vibration amplitude of the probe immediately and markedly decreases to a small vibration 
as shown in Figure 5. Using this as the starting point, the immersed depth can be controlled by the stage. 
The stage has a resolution of 5µm in each step and 50 steps per revolution. By finely adjusting the stage, 
the error in determining the starting point can be reduced to within 10µm.  
 The tested fluids used in the experiment include air, deionized water and sucrose(S5-500, 
Fisher Scientific) Various concentrations of sucrose from 10% to 50% have been tested and the test 
processes were started from air, water, and then sucrose in order to avoid the residue of sucrose 
remaining on the probe if the process in a reversed manner. When testing the sucrose, the concentration 
of sucrose was tested from low (10%) to high (50%). After each step of testing a concentration of 
sucrose, the probe was rinsed with deionized water. 
 The frequency response of the probe in a different fluid can be build by sweeping the 
frequency in the range of interest. In the experiment, the frequency range was set from 300 Hz to 500 
Hz. The frequency is incremented by 2 Hz and the measurement time is held for 10 seconds for each 
step. Peak hold mode is set on dynamic signal analyzer so that the maximum peak can be measured at 
each step. 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5 the method used to determine the immersed depth is by actuating the probe at near resonant 
frequency (400Hz) first and then finely adjusting the vertical stage until the probe touch the surface of

Where u is the velocity  is the density p is the normal pressure,  is the viscosity and f is the 
source of other force. For our case the displacement of the fiber contribute to the normal and viscous 
force in fluid calculation. Hence, f equals zero. 
 
 The viscosity can be extracted from the Model by first matching the frequency response 
of air and then continue to model fluid with different viscosity and mass density. Furthermore, the 
viscosity set in the model will be compared with the viscosity in [44]. In this case, the viscosity 
calculated in the model can be validated. 
7.4 Resutls and Discussion 
 
 The viscosity is tested under two kinds of conditions: (1) water with different immersion 
length and (2) fluid with different viscosity and mass density. The immersion depth of the fiber in the 
fluid must be taken into concern as it significantly affects the dampening of vibration in the surrounding 
fluid. Even with a change of a few microns, the frequency response can be significantly altered. From 
Fig 6(a), the length changed between each test is 125µm. By altering the immersion depth from 125 to 
250 microns, the signal was decreased by 10 dB. However, the light intensity change from 250um to 
375um drops about 5 dB. The light intensity drop from 375µm to 500µm is even smaller. From this 
result, the conclusion can be drawn that the dampening changes significantly for shallow immersion 
depths. This is reasonable because the damping between air and water varied tremendously so that the 
probe is very sensitive to water dampening in a shallow immersion region. The error may be minimized 
by using shorter fiber with higher stiffness or using fiber with streamlined shape which can reduce the 
drag force in the fluid. 
 For frequency response of the probe with different fluid as shown in Fig 6(b), the 
difference between water, sucrose 10% and sucrose 20% is small. However the differences between 
 63 
 
Figure 7 shows that viscosity of the sucrose increase exponentially with respect to concentration 
 
\ 
Figure 8 Displacement of the probe is normalized in respect to the 21V at 400Hz drive signal  
 
An indirect method of measuring the viscosity of the fluid has been thoroughly 
demonstrated. With this sensor, the viscosity of a given sample may be readily determined by 
measuring the displacement of the probe. The control of the immersed depth may result in an error

作者在 11 月 22 日主要參與為「液滴」之場次，該研討會論文內容從液滴的產生、液滴
本身性質，其潑濺形式以及周圍環境對液滴表現的影響，另外還有對於接合不同大小、性質液
滴均有討論，像是藉由實驗結果得知 Mesler entrainment 的存在會依韋伯數與液滴的 axis 比
例而定，於是得知韋伯數與 Mesler entrainment 之關係後，便可避免使用純水時 contaminating 
surfactants 的影響；使用高速攝影機觀察液滴落於砂中時，初期液滴表面張力、慣性力、黏滯
力會導致原本形狀巨大的改變，而一旦接觸到砂的表面，吸力便會增加而使液滴的動作結束；
觀察風對液滴碰撞水面的影響，發現其二次液滴串會是以背風的方向所產生；液滴噴濺在固體
表面之前，液滴與表面間的微少氣體形成薄層，將這一微秒間的行為作理論數值分析；以毛細
管作為模型，觀察液滴撞擊孔隙材料時的表現；用電腦模擬計算高速液滴撞擊固體表面時，液
體壓縮性對初始動力與橫向射流的影響。 
而作者的報告被安排在此次研討會的第一個場次的「液滴撞擊」中，題目是「在自由掉落
液滴撞擊液面所產生液泡的影響(Oscillating Eﬀects on the Bubble Induced by A Free Falling 
Drop)」。液滴撞擊液體能產生許多不同的衍生型態，其研究在百餘前年就已經開始探討，
Worthington 在 1908 年就已經利用凍結法拍攝整個液滴撞擊的過程，但是至目前為止，尚沒有
文獻對其振盪液滴和漂浮大氣泡進行研究。因此，本研究首度針對漂浮大氣泡進行詳細的實驗
以及整體系統化的分析，改變液滴撞擊速度、液滴粒徑和水槽深度以及新增加一液滴形狀參數
來做此型態作探討，進而針對已存在十餘年的撞擊速度與液滴粒徑的撞擊型態分類圖進行修
正。報告後，引起會場很熱烈的提問與興趣。

不需使用母模的圖案塗佈技術之主要優勢是：不僅可省下母模製作所需之成本與時間，也
相對的提高圖案之可變動性。而由於此類技術一般必須配合較複雜之機電系統，並且同時需控
制流體的輸送與定位，所以此類技術直至近年來才有比較具體的工業應用開發。 
「筆寫式」之塗佈印刷技術已被大量應用於微陣列(microarray)點片技術，應用於基因體
定序及生物、醫藥篩選檢測等領域，另外配合原子力顯微技術，而發展出「沾筆式奈米微影技
術（Dip-Pen Nanolithography，DPN)」，可在一片生物晶片上載入數千至數萬的基因樣點，並
且目前的方法容許偵測到極微細的細胞內變化，使得研究者能透過晶片上的數據得整體性訊
息。  
「噴滴塗佈技術」是近幾年最熱門的非微影圖案產生技術，其利用電路控制外力透過管壁
擠壓噴嘴內之工作流體，當流體被擠出噴嘴時，藉由流體之不穩定性造成氣液界面的波動振
盪，進而相互拉扯以致碎裂成小液滴而噴離噴嘴，但由於此法產生之液滴飛行之行徑中易受氣
流干擾，故所需機台之定位精度高且移動速度也受限制，而高度機動及均勻性等問題在較大範
圍塗佈上仍需有效解決。 
 「機械阻斷式塗佈技術」乃透過傳統之塗佈技術，再配合機械閥門或是主動元件之反覆
運作來截斷工作流體供應源之輸出與否，以產生非連續液膜，因此，如何精確控制流體供應元
件使塗膜之前後緣可整齊截斷無破損，並配合作動基版精準對位被視為此類技術之兩大操作關
鍵因素。而此技術之最大限制在於機械元件作動時，機台與流體所天生存在之慣性，使其塗佈
之圖案特徵尺寸無法太小；另外，此法也不利於複雜微圖案之產出。 
本實驗室自行研究開發之技術，「双相流截斷式塗佈技術」，承接上述機械截斷式塗佈技術
之基本概念，利用提供不連續之流體源並配合基板之連續移動來產生斷續圖案；然而，為克服
機械截斷式因機械元件慣性快不起來的缺點，双相流截斷式技術則是利用不互溶之流體於塗佈
頭(coater)內之微管道中相互截斷，來產生不連續塗佈流體源，所以在小慣性的本質優勢下，
即可大幅改善上述機械截斷式塗佈技術阻斷頻率低之缺點。由於兩流體分離之過程並無劇烈的
流體扯斷動作，所以塗膜之前後緣可保持其原來自然整齊的截斷面而無破損。透過排列此不連
續區塊之比例及塗佈頭與基板之互動，則可於基板上產生千變萬化的各式圖案；而因為所使用
的基本元素僅為一液體與一氣體，兩種流體，故吾人比擬太極由陰與陽兩元素而產生不同卦象
之意，將此塗佈技術暱稱為「太極塗佈法」。利用此方式產生微雙相流最大好處在於其可產生
之相間雙相流體的頻率範圍相當大(>10kHz)，並且無需複雜的流體截斷控制動作與動件，而利
