1.Introduction 
   After Strouhal’s experiment on Aeolian 
tones in 1878, flow over a bluff cylinder has 
been a subject of great interest for research for 
more than one hundred years.  The most 
prominent feature is the Karman vortices shed 
from bluff body.  While the mechanism of 
vortex shedding has not been fully clarified so 
far, many physical aspects of this phenomenon 
have been unveiled in detail in the literature.   
    In the past sixty years, a great amount of 
knowledge has been accumulated concerning 
the three-dimensional characteristics of wake 
behind a circular cylinder.  For instance, 
Tritton (1959) pointed out that for Reynolds 
number, called Re here, below 90 the wake 
would exhibit a two-dimensional character.  As 
Reynolds number increased, three-dimensional 
behavior of wake flow got prominent.  Roshko 
(1954) pointed out that for Reynolds number in 
a range of 150 to 300, two-dimensional periodic 
vortex shedding underwent a transition to  
 
three-dimensionality, signified by the 
irregularities in the wake velocity fluctuations 
measured.   
    Further evidence regarding the 
three-dimensionality of vortex shedding found 
in the literature can be given below.  
Three-dimensional vortical structures behind a 
circular cylinder were observed by Grant (1958).  
He carried out hot-wire velocity measurements 
and a cross-correlation method to study the 
wake behind a circular cylinder in a 
two-dimensional cross-flow.  Toebes (1969) 
positioned six hot-wire probes equidistantly 
along the spanwise direction in the potential 
wake region of a circular cylinder, which was 
fitted with a small end plate.  The 
simultaneous measurements of six hot-wire 
probes at Re=6.8×104 unveiled the modulations 
of vortex shedding and changes in phase 
between signals.  Toebes (1969) argued that 
the amplitude modulation might be due to the 
variation in strength of turbulent eddies, an 
indication of the three-dimensionality in vortex 
shedding from the cylinder.  Gerrard (1966) 
employed an array of hot-wires along the 
spanwise direction in the wake of a circular 
cylinder, and noticed that most of the time 
studied the vortex shedding frequencies reduced 
at different locations were not coincided.  
    Concerning flow visualization of the 
three-dimensional phenomena of wake flows, 
an earlier work of Hama (1957) presented 
photographs for Reynolds numbers at 190 and 
313, which revealed the irregular, wavy patterns 
of shedding vortices along the spanwise 
direction.  Mattingly (1962) carried out flow 
visualization experiment in a water channel by 
releasing dye from a circular cylinder.  He 
observed wavy separation line in oscillation 
accompanied by eddy filaments.  Wei and 
Smith (1986), Williamson (1988), 
Bays-Muchmore and Ahmed (1993), Wu et al. 
(1994) and Cimbala et al. (1998) reported the 
results of flow visualization concerning 
streamwise vortices in near wake regions behind 
circular cylinders, named the secondary vortices, 
which were connected to the 
three-dimensionality embedded in the vortex 
shedding process.   
    Roshko (1993) attributed the 
three-dimensionality of vortex shedding to 
extrinsic and intrinsic effects.  Extrinsic effect 
is due to geometric configuration of bluff body 
mainly; whereas intrinsic effect is associated 
with the instabilities of flow.  In the following, 
research findings relevant to the extrinsic effect 
will be first reviewed and then those of the 
intrinsic effect.   
    Speaking of the extrinsic effect, extensive 
discussion on the arrangement of end plates and 
the aspect ratio of a bluff body can be found in a 
 6 
vorticity in the near wake, which were called 
Modes A and B, respectively.  At Re ≈ 180, 
mode A vortex shedding appears, which is 
characterized by streamwise vortices with a 
spanwise wavelength of approximately 3 
cylinder diameters.  At Re ≈ 230, a second 
mode (mode B) appears, consisting of a more 
irregular array of streamwise vortices with a 
mean spanwise wavelength of about one 
cylinder diameter.   
    Concerning the numerical studies at higher 
Reynolds numbers, Najjar and Vanka (1995) 
carried out a direct numerical simulation of 
wake behind a flat plate held normal to a 
free-stream for Reynolds number at 1000.  The 
three-dimensional simulation was able to 
account for the intrinsic three-dimensionality 
that develops beyond a certain critical Reynolds 
number (Re=200). On the other hand, the 
numerical results of Henderson (1997) for 
Reynolds number at 1000 showed that shedding 
vortices might develop localized phase 
dislocations, which are responsible for 
modulating the amplitude of fluctuating lift and 
drag.  
    In reality, both of the intrinsic and extrinsic 
effects mentioned above could be presented in 
wake flows.  Lisoski (1993) noticed the 
presence of low frequency variations in the force 
measurements of a cylinder as it was moved in a 
quiescent water channel.  By increasing the 
aspect ratio of the cylinder, the characteristic 
period of low frequency modulations tended to 
decrease.  However, for the aspect ratio larger 
than ten, the modulation period was maintained 
constant at about six-fold the vortex-shedding 
period.  As Lisoski (1993) suggested, the results 
inferred that for an infinite aspect ratio this 
modulation might still exist, which could be due 
to the instabilities of the wake flow.    
   In reviewing the literature, an important 
aspect of the thee-dimensionality of vortex 
shedding noticed is the phenomenon of vortex 
dislocation.  Table 1 lists a survey of recent 
findings concerning this phenomenon, including 
both numerical simulation and experimental 
works.  As found, the phenomenon of vortex 
dislocation could be developed naturally in 
wake flows at Reynolds numbers as low as in 
the order of 102; whereas in some others, they 
were developed from a tapered cylinder, or 
triggered by a forced disturbance at a localized 
position on a bluff cylinder of uniform cross 
section.  Irrespective that the events of vortex 
dislocations were actively or passively produced, 
they signify an important feature that the wake 
flows are strongly three-dimensional.  
Williamson (1997) explained the phenomenon 
as a result of a vortex loop growing in 
amplitude until locally a complete spanwise 
segment of the primary vortex shed out-of-step 
with the shedding to each side.  Williamson 
(1997) further pointed out that low-frequency 
irregularities observed in the velocity signals 
measured were due to the existence of “vortex 
dislocation” in wake transition, yielding the 
dominant turbulence intensity downstream.  
   In the natural development of wake flow, 
vortex dislocation is occurred randomly in 
space and time.  Thus, it poses a difficulty, as 
noted in the previous studies, that the 
experimental techniques employed were unable 
to depict the phenomenon in a quantitative 
manner.  To capture the events of vortex 
dislocation in the instantaneous sense, a new 
experimental method was employed in this 
study.  This method was enabled with applying 
arrays of MEMS 
(Miro-Electrical-and-Mechanical System) 
thermal film sensors on the surface of a bluff 
body. Subsequently, the real-time multi-channel 
signals were analyzed with Wavelet and 
2D-FFT transformations.  Since the self-made 
MEMS sensors were so densely packed that the 
spatial resolution of measurements was 
sufficient to unveil the spanwise characteristics 
of vortex shedding in detail.  Furthermore, 
Wavelet analysis of the signals of each sensor 
was capable of providing the information of 
vortex shedding at a local time.  Findings of 
the instantaneous behaviors of vortex shedding 
were subsequently supplemented by the results 
of 2D-FFT analysis of the multi-channel signals, 
which provided further information concerning 
the spanwise characteristics of vortex shedding.  
    Moreover, this study was intended to 
examine the impact of geometrical shape of 
bluff body on the three-dimensionality of vortex 
shedding. Along this consideration, three bluff 
bodies including a circular cylinder, a normal 
plate and a T-shaped cylinder were employed.  
The circular cylinder represents a case that in 
the Reynolds number range studied the flow 
separation point was not fixed on the surface 
with respect to time.  On the other hand, the 
normal plate represents a case that the flow

MEMS sensors in an array.  Further, a SEM 
photo shown in figure 2b indicates that an 
individual sensor is 200 µm × 260 µm in 
dimension with a resistance of about 150 Ω.  
Each MEMS sensor was made of platinum, 
0.1µm in thickness, which was sandwiched 
between two polyimide layers of 10 µm in 
thickness each.  Figure 3c presents a SEM 
photo depicting the final configuration of the 
sensors.   Note that each sensor was actually 
exposed to ambient air, in order to sense flow 
motions.  
 The signal of each sensor was amplified 
with a constant current circuit (Tu, 2007). In the 
previous study, Miau et al. (2006) reported that 
the DC output signals revealed large amplitude 
variations at low frequencies when subjected to 
unsteady flow motions.  This drift was 
suspected due to heat conduction between 
sensor and substrate. To overcome this problem, 
a high pass filter was introduced in the circuitry 
to filter out the low-frequency components. 
Thus, the resultant AC signals were associated 
with the fluctuating motions of flow mainly. A 
comparison of the DC and AC output signals 
sampled simultaneously is made in Figure 3. As 
seen, the low frequency components in the DC 
signal were successfully filtered out by the AC 
circuit.  As a result, the dominant frequency 
component identified in the AC signals is due to 
vortex shedding.  It should be mentioned that 
the present sensor was able to detect the 
fluctuating motions up to several kHz, 
evidenced by the measurements in a transonic 
wind tunnel. (Chen, 2006) 
  
3. Techniques of data analysis 
3.1 Wavelet analysis 
In order to provide a quantitative 
description of the instantaneous flow behaviors 
inferred by the MEMS sensor signals, the 
technique of Wavelet transformation was 
employed. Wavelet transformation of a signal 
trace u(t) with respect to a wavelet function ψ(t) 
is defined by a convolution integral: (Grossman 
and Morlet 1984)

where a and b are called the scale and 
translation, respectively, and ψ* is the complex 
conjugate of ψ.  Following our previous 
experiences (Wu et al. 2005; Tu et al. 2005; 
Miau et al. 2006), a Morlet wavelet function 
was adopted in the present Wavelet 
transformation.  Thus, the mathematical 
expression of ψ is given below.

        (2) 
where the parameter kψ was taken to be 6.0 to 
satisfy the admissibility condition. (Farge 1992)  
With ψ given in (2), one can see that the 
Wavelet transformation in (1) appears like a 
finite-time Fourier transformation.   
    In this study, computation of Wavelet 
transformation was carried out with the 
MATLAB software.  According to Torrence 
and Compo (1998), the wavelet coefficient W(a, 
b) in (1) can be analytically transformed into 
W(f, t), where f and t are the frequency and time, 
respectively, of the signals analyzed. As a result, 
W(f, t) can be referred to as a time-frequency 
spectrum, which provides the spectral 
information of the signal at a localized time. In 
the present Wavelet analysis, the vortex 
shedding frequency, fs, at a given time instant 
was determined as the ridge among all the 
moduli of the wavelet coefficients.   
 Further, the phase θ of fs at a time t can be 
defined below.

where R and I denote the real and imaginary 
parts of W(fs, t ), respectively.  It was verified 
that the time-average value of fs was equivalent 
to the peak frequency read from the 
corresponding Fourier spectra, called Fs here.   
 
3.2 Two-dimensional Fast Fourier 
Transformation (2-D FFT)    
In this study, 2-D FFT was employed to 
analyze the signals of MEMS thermal film 
sensors in a spanwise array.  This analysis 
served the purpose of finding the dominant 
spanwise wave number associated with 
three-dimensional vortex shedding.   
    The algorithm of 2-D FFT was 
implemented by performing the fast Fourier 
transformation (FFT) of a two-dimensional 
M-by-N input matrix in two steps.  Firstly, it 
performed one-dimensional FFT along a row or 
a column.  Then, repeated the FFT analysis 
with respect to the results of the first step, 
namely along a column or a row.  Thus, the 
fundamental operation of 2D-FFT can be 
 10
emerged from these observations is that the 
process of vortex shedding process can be 
two-dimensional like, but intermittently 
interrupted by strongly three-dimensional 
appearances.  Wu et al. (2005) and Szepessy 
(1994) also pointed out that this is an intrinsic 
characteristic of wake flows behind bluff bodies 
at Reynolds numbers of 104. 
Figure 7 presents a photo and a schematic 
drawing of the circular cylinder model with the 
MEMS sensors for experiment.  As seen, there 
were 14 sensors selected for measurement, 
named S1 to S14, which were positioned 
symmetrically with respect to z=0 in the 
spanwise direction.  Specifically, they were 
located at z=±0.1D, ±0.3D, ±0.75D, ±1.1D, 
±1.5D, ±1.9D and ±2.3D, respectively.   
    Figure 8 presents a set of raw signals 
obtained by S1 to S14 at θ=75o and Re=2.7×104, 
over a time length of 1 second.  Remarkable 
features noted from this figure can be described 
below.  Firstly, while fluctuations in the signals 
of S2 to S13 appear to be dominated by the 
vortex shedding frequency component, the 
signal traces reveal a feature in common that the 
fluctuating amplitudes are strongly modulated.  
Notably, pronounced modulations are seen in 
the neighborhood of t=0.15 and 0.5 seconds, 
where t=0 was arbitrarily chosen.   Toebes 
(1969) noted similar characteristic in the 
hot-wire signals measured in the separated shear 
layer behind a circular cylinder.  Toebes (1969) 
further identified that the time instants of small 
fluctuating amplitudes were coincided with the 
events of which strongly three-dimensional 
vortex shedding took place.  Wu et al. (2005) 
reported the observations of low frequency 
modulations in the hot-wire signals obtained in 
the near wake behind a normal plate, outside the 
separated shear layer region.  Based on 
Wavelet analysis of the signals, Wu et al. (2005) 
further concluded that three-dimensional wake 
flow pattern prevailed when the hot-wire signals 
were strongly modulated.  In the present study, 
it is of particular interest to examine such events 
inferred by the MEMS sensor signals.  
Secondly, the signal traces of S1 and S14 show 
that while the fluctuations are dominated by the 
vortex shedding component, the amplitude 
modulations behave somewhat different from 
those of the rest.  Actually, it was found that 
the thickness of the boundary layer developed 
on sidewall was about 20 mm, equivalent to 0.6 
D, therefore the sensors S1 and S14 were 
immersed in the boundary layers on the two 
side walls, respectively.  Consequently, the 
signals obtained by S1 and S14 will not be 
considered for comparison with those of the 
other sensors later. 
    Based on the results of Wavelet analysis on 
the signal traces obtained by S2 to S13 in figure 
8, Figure 9 shows temporal variations of 
spanwise phase differences at fs for vortex 
shedding at S3 to S14 compared to that at S2.  
For instance, the curve S2-S3 indicates temporal 
variations of the instantaneous phase of vortex 
shedding at S2 minus that at S3.  Interestingly 
noted, within t=0.1-0.2 seconds, a phase jump 
of 2π is seen in the curves of S2-S5 to S2-S13; 
and, within t=0.42-0.52 seconds, phase jumps of 
2Nπ, where N denotes a variable integer, can 
be identified in different curves.  These 
observations further imply that within t=0.1-0.2 
seconds strong three-dimensionality of vortex 
shedding occurred in the spanwise region 
between the sensors S4 and S5, which results 
into a phase jump of vortex shedding.  The 
phase difference 2pi is equivalent to one wave 
period of vortex shedding, thus inferring a 
vortex dislocation event occurred somewhere 
between the sensors S4 and S5.  Referring to 
Williamson (1992), this event of vortex 
dislocation can be further categorized as an 
“one-sided” vortex dislocation.  Similar 
phenomenon was reported by Eisenlohr and 
Eckelmann (1989), which was named as vortex 
splitting.  Within t=0.42-0.52 seconds 
pronounced three-dimensionality of vortex 
shedding likely prevails over the entire span of 
the cylinder.  Note that phase jump values of 
2Npi seen in different phase difference curves 
are the results of Wavelet analysis.       
    Figure 10a compares temporal variations 
of fs reduced from the signal traces of S2 to S13 
in figure 8.  As seen in the figure, the time 
intervals corresponding to the occurrences of 
vortex dislocation mentioned above are 
characterized by pronounced variations among 
the fs curves shown. In fact, dropouts in some of 
the fs curves can be identified.  
    Standard deviation of the fs values obtained 
at S2 to S13 at each time instant, called σfs, is 
further examined here as an indication of the 
three-dimensionality of vortex shedding.  
Figure 10b presents temporal variations ofσfs 
normalized by Fs.  As seen in the figure, 
 12
occurred at the spanwise separation larger than 
two diameters of the cylinder.  
    In order to highlight the intermittent nature 
of three dimensionality of vortex shedding, the 
results of short-time 2D-FFT analysis on two 
segments of raw signal traces, each of which is 
0.1 second in length, are presented in figures 14 
and 15 for comparison.  Figure 14a presents a 
situation that all signal traces appear to be 
almost coincided, inferring that the vortex 
shedding process is in phase along the span of 
the circular cylinder.  The corresponding 
2D-FFT spectrum in figure 14b indicates that 
the peak value is clearly located at zero wave 
number and 100 Hz in frequency.  On the other 
hand, figure 15a presents the other situation that 
the signal traces show widely different, 
inferring that the vortex shedding process is 
strongly three-dimensional.  The 
corresponding 2D-FFT spectrum in figure 15b 
indicates that the wave packets appear in a 
widespread distribution.  The maximum 
energy intensity marked by arrowhead is located 
at the wave number -1.  This observation 
implies that along the spanwise direction 
investigated there actually existed a skewed 
(asymmetric) wave pattern during the sampled 
time interval.   
 
4.2 Spanwise characteristics of vortex 
shedding behind a normal plate   
    Experiments were carried out to examine 
the spanwise characteristics of vortex shedding 
behind a normal plate.  Figure 16 presents a 
photo depicting an array of the MEMS sensors 
situated near the sharp edge of the normal plate 
model.  The experiments was carried out with 
13 sensors, numbered S1 to S13, which were 
equidistantly distributed along the span in a 
region of 3 D in length, 0.5mm from the edge of 
the normal plate.  Thus, the sensors actually 
sensed the characteristics of initial separation of 
flow.  In addition, a hot-wire probe was 
positioned in the free-stream at (x, y, z)= (0, 1 D, 
0) to monitor the convection of shedding 
vortices.  
    Figure 17a presents the sampled signal 
traces of the hot-wire and the MEMS sensors at 
Re=4.8×104, over a time length of 1 second.  
As seen, while fluctuations in the signal traces 
are dominated by the vortex shedding 
component, the fluctuating amplitudes appear 
strongly modulated, similar to the case of flow 
over a circular cylinder mentioned earlier.  The 
FFT spectra given in figure 17b indicate that the 
peak frequencies, i. e., vortex shedding 
frequencies, reduced from the signal traces of 
the sensors S1, S7, S13 and hot-wire are 
coincided, about 101Hz.  This appearance 
strongly suggests that the mean flow be 
two-dimensional like. It worthwhile to mention 
that in the previous case of flow over the 
circular cylinder, measurements of time-mean 
vortex shedding frequencies at different 
spanwise locations also showed that the values 
were agreed very well. These observations 
actually support the statement made by 
Szepessy (1994) that at Reynolds numbers of 
104 the effect of end plate shows no impact on 
the time-averaged shedding frequencies 
obtained over the central part of the span of a 
circular cylinder.  This is noted different from 
what was found by Williamson (1989), Konig et 
al. (1993) and Eisenlohr and Eckelmann (1989) 
for flows at Reynolds numbers of 102.  As 
pointed out by Szepessy (1994), this difference 
has an implication that at high subcritical 
Reynolds numbers the occurrences of vortex 
dislocation are not necessarily caused by a 
direct interaction with the low-frequency cells 
at the endplates. 
    Figure 18 presents the results of Wavelet 
analysis of the signal traces in figure 17a.  In 
figure 18a, the fs curves of S1 to S13 are plotted 
for comparison.  In figure 18b, temporal 
variations of spanwise phase differences at fs 
concerning vortex shedding at S2 to S13 
compared to that at S1 are shown.   
    As a resemblance to the previous case of 
flow over the circular cylinder, in the present 
case three-dimensionality of vortex shedding is 
well indicated by non-zero phase differences of 
vortex shedding along the span of the cylinder.  
Notably, in figure 18b a phase jump of 2pi takes 
place within t=0.1-0.2 seconds at the spanwise 
location of S3, which infers an occurrence of 
vortex dislocation. Further noted, since this 
event is found in the curve of S1-S3 only, 
physically it corresponds to a situation of 
“two-sided” vortex dislocation named by 
Williamson (1992).  The other phase jump 
event can be identified around t=0.7-0.8 
seconds, where all the phase difference curves, 
except the one of S1-S2, show significant phase 
jumps of 2Npi, inferring that strong 
dimensionality prevails over almost the entire 
 14
model is further examined with MEMS sensors. 
The splitter plate employed was of 2 D in length.   
Experiment was carried out with the same 
MEMS sensors described in the last section.  A 
hot-wire probe was positioned at the same 
location as that shown in figure 16 to monitor 
the convection of shedding vortices.  
    Figure 24 presents the raw signal traces 
obtained by the hot-wire and the MEMS sensors 
S1 to S13 on the T-shaped cylinder at 
Re=4.8×104, over a time length of 1 second.  
Unlike the raw signal traces in figure 17a for the 
normal plate case, modulations of fluctuating 
amplitude in the present case are much reduced.  
Moreover, all signals traces appear almost 
coincided in time, inferring that the vortex 
shedding process appears two-dimensional like.  
These observations give a strong support to 
Miau et al. (1993 and 2005) that the addition of 
the splitter plate can stabilize the vortex 
shedding process effectively.  
Figure 25a presents the fs curves 
corresponding to the signal traces in figure 24.  
Again, the fs curves of all the sensors are almost 
coincided.  Moreover, figure 25b presents the 
temporal variations of spanwise phase 
differences at fs concerning vortex shedding at 
S2 to S13 compared to that at S1.  Remarkably 
noted, no phase jump event can be identified; in 
fact, the phase difference values appear no more 
than 0.3(rad.), or 18°.  Above observations 
strongly suggest that the vortex shedding 
process within the time sampled be almost 
perfectly two-dimensional, distinctly different 
from those seen in the two previous cases. 
  Figure 26 provides further evidence 
concerning the characteristic of 
two-dimensional like vortex shedding in the 
present flow with the results reduced over a 
time length of 180 seconds.  In this figure, 
comparisons of the instantaneous phases at fs 
with regard to vortex shedding at S1, S13 and 
S7 (z=+1.5D, -1.5D and 0, respectively) for two 
Reynolds numbers are made. For Re=4.8×104, 
figure 26a reveals a trend that vortex shedding 
at S1 or S13 is always lagging behind that at S7, 
by a time-mean phase difference about 
-0.2(rad.); on the other hand, the phases of 
vortex shedding at S1 and S13 are quite 
comparable.  For Re= 2.4×104, figure 26b also 
shows the similar trend mentioned above; 
vortex shedding at S1 or S13 is lagging behind 
S7 by about 0.4(rad.).  Note that no phase 
jump events can be found in either figure 26a or 
b.  Therefore, the data confirm the behavior of 
two-dimensional like vortex shedding with the 
present bluff model.  On the other hand, the 
appearance of vortex shedding at S1 and S13 
lagging slightly behind that at S7 can be 
reasoned due to the presence of two side-walls. 
Thus, it is seen that in the present case, the bluff 
model can make vortex shedding 
two-dimensional; however, the viscous effect 
due to the presence of sidewalls (endplates) 
comes into play to introduce the 
three-dimensionality.    
   Referring to (1) and denoting the Wavelet 
modulus of fs as As, one was able to examine the 
correlation between fs and As in the signals of 
each MEMS sensor.  Figure 27 presents the 
correlation coefficients, called RAf, reduced from 
the signals obtained by S7 (at z=0), over a time 
length of 180 seconds.  In the figure, each data 
point indicates a RAf value reduced over a time 
period of 6 seconds.  Since the RAf values 
reduced are all negative and close to -1, fs and 
As are realized to be highly correlated in a 
manner that as fs gets increased, As gets 
decreased, and vice versa.  Physically speaking, 
according to Miau et al. (2004 and 2006), RAf in 
negative value infers that as the vortex 
formation region gets smaller in size, the vortex 
shedding frequency get higher, and vice versa.  
Note that this trend was also reported earlier in 
Miau et al. (2004), Wu et al. (2005) and Miau et 
al. (2006) for flows over a normal plate and a 
circular cylinder.  However, in the previous 
studies, this trend was associated with the three 
dimensional characteristics of vortex shedding 
mainly; the coefficient values obtained of flows 
over a normal plate and a circular cylinder were 
about -0.5 and -0.4, respectively (Miau et al., 
2004 and 2006).  Interestingly noted, this trend 
is even more remarkable in the present case, but 
actually is realized in the process of 
two-dimensional like vortex shedding.   
The RAf curves reduced from the signals of 
other sensors were also examined in the present 
study.  A table included in figure 27 gives the 
correlation coefficients between the RAf curves 
of S7 and S8, S1 and S7, S7 and S13, and S1 
and 13, respectively.  Since the correlation 
coefficients appear high and close to 1, even the 
one of S1-S13, they further imply that the

一、行程簡述 
9 月 10 日上午，筆者與同事鄭泗滄教授攜家眷前往高雄小港機場搭華航
CI192 班機飛桃園中正機場，隨即轉 CI130 班機前往日本北海道新千歲國際機
場。飛機準時到達，約當地下午 2 時許；通關之後，我們一行人在機場大廈的地
下一樓搭快速電車，花了 36 分鐘時間抵達札幌市，隨後我們拉著行李，步出車
站，行約十餘分鐘到達下榻旅館 Sapporo Clark Hotel。該旅館緊臨北海道大學，
離會議地點 JST Innovation plaza Hokkaido 約半個小時的路程，所幸會議期間天
氣 涼 爽 ， 大 家 結 伴 走 路 往 返 ， 感 覺 相 當 舒 適 。 
    此會議的主辦單位是 Japan Society of Experimental Mechanics (JSEM)，委請
北海道大學 Professor M. Iguchi 負責承辦；筆者與系上三位同事乃應 Professor 
Iguchi 之邀參加此項會議。特別說明的是 JSEM 於 2001 年重新改組，除了原來
固體力學特色領域之外，另加入了生物力學與流體力學特色領域，此次會議的主
題包含了上述的各特色領域。 
    依大會統計資料，參加此次會議的人數約九十餘位，來自 10 餘個國家；報
到之後，筆者赫然發現來自台灣的代表團包含 5 位教授及 4 位眷屬，是人數最多
的外國與會團體，筆者於 9 月 12 日晚宴致詞提到這一點時，特別感謝主辦單位
的邀請。 
    會議的第一與第二天上午分別安排 keynote Lectures，其餘的時間安排一般論
文發表，採兩個平行場次同時進行，整個會議至 9 月 14 日中午結束。筆者的論
文安排在第二天下午的 Single-phase and multiphase Flow 2 場次發表；另外，筆
者也擔任了第二天上午 Hydrodynamic Drag I 場次的共同主持人，該場次的另一
位 主 持 人 是 P r o f e s s o r  S a w a i  ( 日 本 k i n k i  U n i v e r s i t y ) 。 
    會後，筆者、鄭教授與眷屬多留一日在札幌市區遊覽，於 9 月 16 日一同搭
機返台。 
 
二、與會心得紀要 
此次會議包含的實驗力學議題相當廣泛:流體力學視流技術與影像處理、流
體力學的減阻技術、流體量測技術、生物力學與醫療工程、材料實驗的光學與影
像處理、材料處理過程的流體力學問題、單相與多相流、材料測試與評估、非破
壞檢測與評估、傳感器設計等，筆者挑選了其中與個人研究興趣(流體力學)相關
的論文聆聽。就其心得報告如下。 
第一天(9 月 11 日)第一場的 keynote lecture 由 Professor G. Matsui (kinki 
University)講演，題目是”Simultaneous Visualization of Object Behavior and Its 
Surrounding Flow Field”，其內容主要是結合 PIV 測流速技術與三維物件的瞬時
影像紀錄技術，提供瞬時三維流場與物件交互作用的資訊；值得一提的是
料的外國病人能立即建檔處理，最後還給筆者一張醫院的掛號卡，說明下次看病
時，用該卡片掛號。 
 
四、誌謝 
首先感謝國科會計畫經費補助此行差旅費。其次，感謝 Professor M. Iguchi
所領導的大會籌辦團隊，對與會人員照顧得十分週到，尤其感謝 Mr. Saito 帶筆
者看病。在此，也感謝同行的同事鄭泗滄、張克勤、胡潛濱教授在會議期間的相
互關照。
