摘要
在此為期兩年的計畫中，我們進行光激發
自組式量子點的發光特性之相關研究。第一部
分為單一量子點發光頻譜與磁場的響應，第二
部分為單一量子點與共振腔的光子-激子交互
作用。基於磁場響應實驗上觀察到 negative trion
X 的異常 diamagnetic shift，以及其不同於傳統
反磁性的順磁性行為，因此我們發展了一套
Hartree- approximation 的計算方法來模擬量子
點內不同 exciton complexes 的發光行為，模
擬結果顯示出與實驗結果相當一致，並且成功
的定性解釋了這種異常行為，我們發現載子間
的庫倫交互作用對磁場的響應跟量子點尺寸大
小有相當大的關係，且此種異常行為即為載子
間庫倫作用所主導。量子點與共振腔交互作用
的部分，透過製作高品質因子的微柱形共振
腔，我們觀察到量子點的發光特性的確受到共

Abstract
In this two-year project, we have studied the
photoluminescence (PL) characteristics of
self-assembled quantum dots (QDs). The first part
is about the magnetic response and PL of single
QD. Based on previously observed anomalous
diamagnetic shift of negative trions and its
unusual paramagnetic behavior, we develop a
theoretical method using Hatree approximation to
calculate the emission properties of various
exciton complexes. The simulation results are
consistent with the experimental ones so we can
successfully explain the anomalous behavior. We
find that the coulomb interaction between carriers
and its response to applied magnetic field is highly
related to the size of the QDs. The unusual
response is dominated by the coulomb interaction
between carriers. In the part of cavity-QD
interaction, we have successfully fabricated a
high-quality -pillar with embedded single QD.
The enhanced emission of QD is clearly observed
and, more interestingly, the polarization of emitted
light is also tuned by the resonant condition. The
detailed data analysis and theoretical work are
undertaking.
Methods and results
Part I. Magnetic response of PL from QDs
The InAs QDs were grown on GaAs (100)
substrate using the Stranski-Krastanow mode by a
4Fig. 2: Emission energy of exciton complexes shift with B2
for QD1. The simulated QD is of 11.6 nm in diameter and
1.1 nm in height. Points are the measured data and lines are
the simulated result.
Fig. 3: The diamagnetic coefficient of the exciton complexes
for the two typical QDs (QD1 and QD2). The simulated
parameters are diameter of 11.6 nm and height of 1.1 nm
(QD1); diameter of 11 nm and height of 1.4 nm (QD2).
The reduced optical diamagnetic coefficient
of X  could be caused either by relatively
localized particle wave functions of the initial X 
state or extended electron wave function in the
final 1e state. In the latter, the electron wave
function is free of inter-particle interactions and
determined solely by the confining potential of
QD. By contrast, a particle in a few-particle X 
complex is subjected to additional inter-particle
(e-e and e-h) interactions. The extents of the
particle wave functions of the X  and 1e states
could become substantially different if the
inter-particle interactions are comparable to or
even stronger than the confining strength of QD.
The hole wave functions are much more localized
than those of electrons in such small QDs. The
imbalanced e-h and e-e interactions yield a net
Coulomb attraction to electrons in X  and thus
make the extent of the electron wave function of
the X  state smaller than that of 1e state. To
confirm such a scenario for the explanation of the
observed anomalous diamagnetic behavior, we
perform the numerical simulation for the wave
functions of interacting particles in X complexes,
implemented by using the finite element method
within the Hartree approximation.
In the Hartree approximation, the
Schrodinger equation of a particle in an interacting
X complex confined in QD is written as
  )()()()( inininiHisp rrrVrH    (1)
where ir

denotes the position coordinate of the
i-th particle, ( )ispH r

stands for the Hamiltonian of
the (non-interaction) electron or hole, in the
eigenenergy, )( in r
 the particle wave function of
the eigenstate n , and ( )H iV r

is the Hartree
potential, a sum of the electrostatic potentials
induced by other charged particles besides the
considered particle itself.
In the calculation, cone-shaped QDs of
various sizes sitting on a 0.4-nm-thick wetting
layer are considered. For an N-particle X complex,
the N-coupled equations for each particle
according to Equation (1) are self-consistently
solved by using iterative approach. The total
6that the electron gradually loses confinement as
the dot size reduces, which pushes the electron
level toward the wetting-layer continuum,
resulting in a very extended electron wave
function penetrating into the barrier material. In
such a case of weak confinement regimes, the very
extended initial-state electron becomes sensitive to
the long-range Coulomb attractive potential
produced by the hole, by which ,e i will be
contracted and become apparently smaller than
,e f . As a result, the final-state diamagnetic shift
increases, so that the overall diamagnetic shift in
X  is reduced. This explains why the X 
diamagnetic shift decreases rapidly for small-sized
QDs shown in Fig. 4(a).
Likewise, for the emission of positive trion
X, the initial state consists of one electron and
two holes, leaving one hole in its final state after
recombination. As shown in Fig. 4(b), unlike X ,
the lateral extents of hole wave functions
2
h h in the initial and final states are
almost identical for all QD sizes. Due to the larger
effective mass of holes, their wave functions are
well confined even in such small QDs. In this case,
the Coulomb attractive potential produced by the
weakly confined electron becomes less important,
so that the size dependence of X behaves as
usual.
Now one may ask the question why the X 
diamagnetic shift exhibits a non-quadratic B
dependence. In general, a quadratic diamagnetic
shift holds only in the weak-field limit, i.e., when
the magnetic length /M eB  is large
compared to the lateral extents of carrier’s wave
functions 2 . We noted that 15 nmM 
at 3 TB , which becomes comparable with
, 10 nme f  for the final-state electron in a QD
with a base diameter of 12 nm. In this regime, the
diamagnetic shift would deviate from the typical
B2 dependence. To illustrate this behavior, we
consider the diamagnetic shift in the carrier’s
single-particle energy and expand it in powers of B
as, SP 2 4( )B B B        , where the
quadratic and quartic coefficients are
2 2 / 8e m    and 4 6 2/128e m      , in
which ore h denotes electron or hole, and
m represents the effective mass of the electron
or hole. Because | / | varies as 4~ , the
contribution from the 4B term becomes
increasingly important as ~ M  . By taking into
account the difference between ,e i and ,e f , a
simple algebraic analysis for the X  diamagnetic
shift ( )XE B gives the following expression:
2 4( )X X XE B B B       (2)
where , , ,(2 )X e i h i e f      and
, , ,(2 )X e i h i e f      . Because of h e  and
h em m , the ,h i and ,h i for the hole only
have minor influences on the overall
diamagnetism. Accordingly, we obtain
2 22
, , , ,2 (2 ) /8X e i e f e i e f ee m       and
8diamagnetic shift to a quartic dependence, and
finally into a special paramagnetic regime with an
overall negative energy shift.
Part II. Cavity-QD interaction
For defining the interaction strength between
cavity mode (CM) and exciton (X),
temperature-varying technique was implemented
on the sample since the quantum dot exciton
changes more drastically with temperature than the
cavity mode. For the micropillar of quality factor
6,300, the exciton was brought to resonant with
cavity mode at 35.2K as Fig. 6 indicates. The
energy crossing between CM and X could be
observed more clearly while the peak energy was
depicted as a function of temperature as shown in
Fig. 7. So the pillar under investigation can be
inferred to be in weak coupling regime. The PL
linewidth depicted in Fig. 8 also evidences that
exciton state does not couple strongly to cavity
mode since the linewidth of X remains unchanged
no matter detuned near or away from CM.

Fig. 7 PL peak energy as a function of temperature
Fig. 8 PL linewidth as a function of detuning energy between
CM and X
To systematically investigate the spin
polarization of quantum dot exciton coupled to
cavity mode, we first examine the impact of cavity
on the linear polarization of exciton emission. At
10K, the exciton emission (black solid-square in
Fig. 9) is polarized at 37.7° which is oriented 52°
with respect to the cavity mode (red open-square
in Fig. 9) as Fig. 9 presents. According to Purcell
equation, the Purcell effect can be modulated as
the energy detuning between X and CM is varied.
Through varying temperature, the energy detuning
between X and CM can be changed and thus the
Purcell enhancement can be changed as well.

the control of cavity mode and becomes primitive.
For pillar C, as shown in Fig. 12, exciton orienting
an acute angle with respect to cavity mode, the
polarization plane of exciton emission thus rotates
toward that of cavity mode as exciton is detuned
near CM. However, the polarization degree of
exciton remains unchanged as changing energy
detuning and exhibits almost same quantity with
that of cavity mode. The above-mentioned pillars
lead to the possibility that the polarization
properties of a quantum dot, which has been
testified to be a single photon source, can be
controlled to desired emission polarization and
emit light more efficiently by interacting with
cavity mode.

In conclusion, at current stage we have not
yet perform the investigation on the spin
polarization state of a quantum dot while
concerning the radiative lifetime modulated by a
cavity mode. Nevertheless, there is still an
interesting finding that Purcell effect results in a
rotation of polarization plane and simultaneously a
change in the polarization degree. The polarization
plane of exciton seems to be clamped at the
orientation of cavity mode as approaching zero
detuning. This gives hint that we can precisely
control the polarization orientation and degree of
quantum dot exciton once the polarization pattern
of cavity mode is decided.

excitation in magnetic semiconductors. Following the morning talk, I presented our work in the topic of 
spin dynamics in the afternoon. Before the end of first day, there is a poster session. Among 27 posters, 
what most impressed me is that Professor Tang came from China built a molecular beam epitaxy 
contained in-situ atoms-grown monitoring and in-chamber Raman spectrum measurement. This is really a 
complicated and difficult work for us who are also doing molecular beam epitaxy. The technique might 
help a lot in upgrading the quality of epilayers.  
   For the second day in the morning (7/24), I still attended the topic of spin dynamics since this topic 
is relatively close to the field that we are researching. What most interests me is the talk about 
optically-induced magnetization switching in TbFeCo thin films. The switching speed of magnetization 
approaches 240 femtosecond which is rather fast for operation. In the afternoon, I changed to another room 
for the topic of magnetic semiconductors. A simulation work has been done very well on the prediction of 
electronic and magnetic properties of magnetic ion doped semiconductor quantum dots by Prof. Cheng. 
The interplay between various relevant spin interactions and the discrete nature of Mn2+ spin distribution 
is shown in the talk to be essential in the magnetism of few Mn2+-doped quantum dots. 
   In the final day (7/25), I gained much Seeback-knowledge from the talks with topics 
“Magneto-Seeback effect in magnetic tunnel junction” and “Spin caloritronics in magnetic tunnel junction 
nanodevices”. Those are related to the sensing of heat. For realizing a good heat sensor, one must design a 
structure that can give rise to an amount of voltage or magnetic field under the application of heat gradient. 
The talk just presents how good the Seeback factor is for their magnetic tunnel junction. Another talk 
attracted me most is the simulation of spin and charge pumping in multilayer. Prof. Chang uses an 
approach of nonequilibrium Green function. The work is indeed practical and gives insights for the study in 
the spin and carrier transfer of multilayer structure.  
 
二、與會心得 
   The core of motivation for me to attend this conference is to share and to gain feedbacks from the 
worldwide professors. They are all professional and experienced in the field of spintronics. After I 
presented our work, there are one suggestion and two comments brought up by three professors. One 
suggests that we can apply vertical electric field to modulate the fine structure of quantum dot and then 
make this condition interact further with the cavity effect. It is a think-worth suggestion but have some 
kinds of difficulty to realize. Two professors comment that this work has an interesting finding.  
   There are people from over 30 countries attending this conference. Which means this conference is 
so grand and important hence attracts many people to attend. I am glad to be one of them since I learned 
very much from this meeting. I stepped into the field that I have never touched and even heard about. I 
gained much knowledge about the properties of various magnetic structures and organic structures those 
are very important in the application of quantum computers and quantum cryptology. Even though we are 
doing totally different works, we are still encouraged and excited through sharing the ideas with each 
other.
