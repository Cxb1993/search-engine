ABSTRACT: 
It is generally accepted that the physical properties and biodegradability of biodegradable 
polymers are influenced strongly by the crystallinity. Melting is the morphological reverse of 
crystallization with respect to the primary and secondary structures produced. Therefore, the 
studies of crystallization kinetics and melting behaviors should be paid enough attention, since 
they not only affect the crystalline structure and morphology of polymers but also affect the final 
physical properties. In this study, aliphatic homopolyesters and copolyesters derived from 
poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) were synthesized by a two-step esterification reaction in the melt. 
Homopolyesters include PBS, poly(ethylene succinate) (PES), poly(trimethylene succinate) (PTS) 
and poly(2-methyl-1,3-propylene succinate) (PMPDS). The chemical compositions and the 
sequence distribution in copolyesters were characterized by NMR spectroscopy. The temperatures 
of initial decomposition were determined by using thermogravimetry and polarized light 
microscope (PLM) in an inert environment. Isothermal growth rates of spherulites were measured 
using PLM by both isothermal and nonisothermal methods. Differential scanning calorimetry 
(DSC) and PLM were used to study the crystallization kinetics. The melting behavior of the 
specimens after isothermal and/or nonisothermal crystallization were investigated with DSC and 
temperature modulated DSC (TMDSC) at different heating rates. The reversing, total, and 
non-reversing heat flow curves were analyzed. The crystal structures at various temperatures 
were examined by X-ray diffraction analysis. In this study, copolyesters and blends were 
examined based on PBS with the composition of MPDS ranging from 0 to 10%, and PBS with 
the composition of PTS ranging from 0 to 10%, respectively. Additionally, the folding surface 
energy of PBS dominated polyesters was estimated.

ABSTRACT: The spherulitic growth of poly(ethylene succinate) (PES) and two 
PES-rich copolyesters at constant cooling rate was monitored and recorded using a 
system of polarized light microscope. Individual experiment of these polyesters lasted 
40, 60 and 120 min, respectively. A continuous curve of isothermal growth rates 
between the melting and glass transition temperatures can be obtained after curve 
fitting procedures. These curves fit very well with those data points determined in the 
isothermal experiments, which are time consuming. The continuous data of PES was 
analyzed with the Hoffman−Lauritzen equation. A transition of regime II → III was 
found at 70.7 °C, which is very close to the literature values. The maximum growth 
rate was formulated in the Arrhenius and WLF expressions for the molecular transport 
term. A master curve of crystal growth rate for PES was constructed based on the 
continuous data of PES. When the reduced growth rates after normalization were 
plotted against the reduced temperatures, a universal master curve was observed for 
PES and two PES-rich copolyesters. This non-isothermal method provides an efficient 
and reliable way for studying the crystallization kinetics of polymer and for 
constructing a universal master curve of crystal growth rate of PES.

ABSTRACT ：   Copolyester was synthesized and 
characterized as having 89.0 mol% butylene succinate units and 
11.0 mol% 2-methyl-propylene succinate units in a random 
sequence, as determined by 13C NMR. Differential scanning 
calorimetry (DSC) was used to investigate the isothermal 
crystallization kinetics of this copolyester in the temperature 
range (Tc) from 75 to 91 °C. The melting behavior after 
isothermal crystallization was investigated by DSC by varying 
the Tc, the heating rate and the crystallization time. DSC curves 
showed multiple melting peaks and the upper melting peaks are 
associated primarily with the melting of lamellar crystals with 
various stabilities. As the Tc increases, the contribution of 
recrystallization slowly decreases and finally disappears. The 
Hoffman-Weeks plot gave an equilibrium melting temperature 
of 118.4 °C. The growth rates of spherulites were analyzed by 
Hoffman and Lauritzen theory. A regime II→III transition was 
found at about 77.2 °C. 
Keywords：Polyesters; crystallization; differential scanning

Introduction 
Polymer universally used such as polyethylene (PE), 
polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene have caused considerable 
environmental pollution since they are not degradable but 
stable. With the rise of concern to global environment in recent 
years, the development of biodegradable polymers offers an 
alternative way to solve the problems. Biodegradable polymers 
are defined as polymers which can be degraded to CO2 and 
H2O by the action of enzymes or microorganisms. 
Biodegradable polymers can be classified into two types 
according to the preparation methods. One is the biosynthetic 
polymer, such as bacterial polyhy- droxyalkanoates (PHAs) [1]. 
The other is the chemosynthetic polymer, such as poly(butylene 
succinate) (PBSu). PBSu is promising candidate degradable 
polyester because it has relatively high melting point and 
favorable mechanical properties [2]. Many researchers have 
found that the degree of crystallinity, spherulite size and 
lamellar structure can influence the biodegradation rate, since 
biodegradation first takes place in the amorphous region, such 
that the rate of erosion of the amorphous region significantly 
exceeds that of the crystalline region [3]. Hence, studies on 
crystallization kinetics and morphology have to precede 
research on degradation behavior. 
In this study, PBSu copolymer with 10 mol% 2-methyl- 
propylene succinate (MPS), PBMPSu 90/10 was synthesized in 
order to increase the biodegradation rate without sacrificing the 
melting point of PBSu. The microstructure of this copolyester 
was identified by means of 13C NMR. The differential scanning 
calorimetry (DSC) data of isothermal crystallization were 
analyzed using the Avrami equation. The origin of the multiple 
melting behaviors of isothermally crystallized specimens was 
elucidated. The linear growth rates of spherulites were obtained 
using a polarized light microscope (PLM) and the regime 
transition temperature was estimated using the Lauritzene- 
Hoffman (LH) equation [4]. 
 
Experimental 
PBMPSu 90/10 was synthesized by a two-step 
esterification reaction in the melt. It was purified after being 
dissolved in chloroform and precipitated into ten times as much 
vigorously stirred ice-cooled methanol. This copolyester had an 
intrinsic viscosity [η] of 1.20 dL/g, measured in 
phenol/1,1,2,2 –tetra– chloroethane (3/2, w/w) at 30 °C. The 
glass transition temperature (Tg) of an amorphous specimen 
was obtained using a Perkin−Elmer Pyris 1 DSC at a heating 
rate of 10 °C /min. The corresponding Tg was −38.3 °C (234.8 
K). 
    
1H and 13C NMR spectra of CDCl3 solution were recorded 
with tetramethylsilane as the reference standard by using the 
Varian UNITY INOVA-500 NMR at 295.5 K. 
    A Perkin-Elmer Pyris 1 DSC, equipped with a refrige- 
rating system (Pyris Intracooler 2P), was calibrated with de- 
ionized water and indium. DSC was calibrated using the heat 
fusion of indium. 4 ± 0.5 mg of sample was used. In the iso- 
thermal crystallization study, the samples were initially heated 
at 20 °C/min from 30 to 190 °C at which temperature they were 
maintained in a molten state for 5 min. They were then quickly 
cooled at a nominal rate of 250 °C /min to the crystallization 
temperature (Tc) between 75 and 91 °C, and crystallized for a 
period that was six times the peak time, to ensure complete 
crystallization. After isothermal crystallization, the specimens 
were scanned up to 140 °C at 10 °C/min to examine their 
melting behavior. The samples were all treated under the same

Introduction 
Aliphatic polyesters are biodegradable because they are susceptible to 
enzymes and microorganisms. Poly(butylene succinate) (PBSu) is one of 
commercially biodegradable polyesters with a relatively high melting 
temperature and some favorable mechanical properties. PBSu exhibits a lower 
biodegradation rate because of its higher crystallization rate and crystallinity. 
Copolymers are well known to have higher degradation rates than 
homopolymers, which fact is basically attributed to the limited crystallinity. In 
this study, PBSu and PBSu-rich copolyesters were synthesized and 
characterized. 
 
Experimental 
Materials and Synthesis.  1,4-Butanediol (BD), 1,3-propanediol (PD), 
2-methyl-1,3-propanediol (MPD) and succinic acid (SA) were used without 
purification. PBSu, PBSu-rich copolyesters, poly(trimethylene succinate) 
(PTSu) and poly(2-methyl-propylene succinate (PMPSu) were synthesized by 
a two-step esterification reaction in the molten state.1 The molar ratio of diols 
and SA were 1:1. Titanium tetraisopropoxide was used as a catalyst with 0.1 
mol% based on the amount of SA used. Copolyesters were synthesized with a 
BD:PD (or BD:MPD) feed molar ratio of 95:5. The sample codes are listed in 
the first row of Table 1.

Characterization.  1H and 13C NMR spectra of CDCl3 solutions were 
recorded with tetramethylsilane as the reference standard by using the Varian 
UNITY INOVA-500 NMR at 295.5 K. These polyesters had intrinsic 
viscosity values, [η], ranging from 1.20 to 1.29 dL/g measured in 60/40 w/w 
phenol/1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane solution at 30 °C (see Table 1). Gel 
permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed at 40 °C using a Waters 
GPC-150CV and a Waters hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) column.1 The flow 
rate of the eluent, HFIP, was 1.0 ml/min. The number average (Mn) and the 
weight average (Mw) molecular weights were calculated using a calibration 
curve which was obtained from 8 poly(methyl methacrylate) standards. A 
Perkin-Elmer Pyris 1 DSC, equipped with a refrigerating system (Pyris 
Intracooler 2P), was used to study their thermal properties, isothermal 
crystallization kinetics and melting behaviors. Thermal stability experiments 
were performed using a TA 2050 thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). X-ray 
diffractograms at room temperature were obtained on a Siemens D5000 
diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ=0.1542 nm, 40 kV, 30 mA) 
at a scanning rate of 1 o/min. A Nikon Optiphot-pol polarizing light 
microscope (PLM) was adopted in combination with a Linkam THMS-600 
heating stage and a TMS-91 temperature control system2-4 to measure the 
spherulite growth rates and to monitor the morphology of PBSu and PBSu-
rich copolyesters. 
Results 
Figure 1 presents the 13C NMR spectra of copolyesters. A magnified 
view of the carbonyl carbons (C6) is shown in the inserted spectra. The 
composition and the sequence distribution of two copolyesters after analysis 
of both 1H and 13C NMR spectra are tabulated in Table 1.

After completely isothermal crystallization, the relative degree of cry-
stallinity at time t was calculated for each temperature (Tc). The half-time of 
crystallization (t1/2) was evaluated. DSC data were analyzed using the Avrami 
equation5-6 that yields an Avrami exponent (n) and a rate constant (k) at 
various Tc values. Figures 3 and 4 plot the overall crystallization rate [(t1/2)-1] 
and k as a function of temperature, respectively. Significant differences can be 
found among polyesters.
