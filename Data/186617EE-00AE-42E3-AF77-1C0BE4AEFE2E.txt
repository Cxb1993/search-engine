Abstract—Electrocardiography (ECG) is a 
transthoracic interpretation of the electrical 
activity of the human’s heart over time captured 
and is highly irregular, random, and variable from 
person to person. Recently, the literature has 
revealed that this kind of signal is, in fact, chaotic. 
Because of people’s ECGs are extremely hard to 
be artificially duplicated, this research intends to 
investigate the way of extracting the ECG signals’ 
biometric features for the possibility of biometric 
recognition. The ECG signal is converted into the 
phase plane by using phase space reconstruction. 
Then, chaos extractor is applied to capture the 
representative indices of chaotic ECG signals i.e., 
correlation dimension and Lyapunov exponents 
spectrum. The root mean square, Lyapunov 
exponent and correlation dimension are used as 
the key variables in neural network training and 
utilized in the identification scheme. From the 
viewpoint of applications, the developed 
identifier would be appropriate for secure 
communication as well. Experiments demonstrate 
the use of the approach in encrypting texts and 
images. Application of the presented approach to 
secure communication is also revealed 
 
Keywords-Electrocardiogram, Biometric recognition,

I. INTRODUCTION 
Some researches investigate the feasibility of 
using the ECG signals as a new biometric media 
for human identity verification. Biel et al. [1] 
conducted an experiment involving 12-lead ECG 
measurement. The preliminary result showed that 
only lead I was able to identify a person up to a 
 3
where jkx  is the orbital point; jkx  is the 
neighboring point of the jkx . If the displacement 
vector is smaller than r , it’s called correlation 
vector. It contains N  points in the phase-space 
after reconstruction. The correlated integration is 
defined as the computation of the percentage 
corresponding 2N  in correlation vector.

The value is added to the embedded dimension. 
Repeating (3)-(5) until the dimension value is 
within an admissible rang. The dimension will not 
be raised with the increasing m. The obtained 
dimension value is called as the correlation 
dimension 2D . 
C. Lyapunov exponent 
Sano and Sawada [12] proposed a method to 
obtain the Lyapunov exponents from time series. 
Let { }jx  belong to a point of discrete time 
sequence and is represented as 0( ( 1) )jx x t j t    . 
The orbital point jx  and   are center point and 
the radius for the ball-like space respectively. 
Corresponding to this space, one needs to select a 
set of points { }( 1, 2,3,..., )

After the time m t   , the orbital point jx  
will be j mx   and neighboring points  ikx  to 
 ik mx  so that the displacement vector ii k jz x x   
will be

where jie  is a set of basis vectors of the tangent

estimation of the local contribution to the 
exponents and renormalization are comprised in 
each step n . 
D. Root mean square (RMS) level 
The root mean square is used here as a 
statistical measure of the magnitude of a varying 
ECG data, which was also one of the major 
indices to differentiate between healthy people 
and people with heart disease in many 
investigations of heart rate variability. The

III. PREPROCESSING AND 
CLASSIFICATION 
A. Outlier 
When the value is not within in the normal 
range, the value is called outlier. It is not easy to 
distinguish the cause for the outlier. If the outlier 
is not handled properly, errors will be induced in 
the analysis. The standard deviation of signal 
distribution is used here as a threshold to deal with 
the outlier. Given a data set of characteristic 
parameters ix R  for 1i N   its  average is

B. Secure Information Transmission 
Synchronization of chaotic systems provides a 
rich mechanism forming another application to 
personalized secure communications because of 
the chaotic ECG properties, which are noise-like 
and virtually impossible to be guessed or 
predicted. The personalized chaotic signals can be 
used in masking information waveforms and used 
as the modulating waveforms [13-15].

where a, b, and c are nonzero parameters. As a 
useful application, the proposed information 
encryption/decryption system combined with 
chaotic synchronization circuits can be used in 
private key masking. The chaotic synchronization 
system consists of a driver circuit and a response 
circuit. Application of the idea in private key 
transmission is based on the chaotic signal 
masking and recovery. A noise-like masking 
signal is added at the transmitter to the private key 
and the masked signal is recovered at the receiver 
side. The whole system is fulfilled by two 
synchronization circuits. Fig. 3 illustrates the 
structure of secure information transmission. 
 
V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
An analog circuit implementation of the 
synchronization of Lorenz-based circuit in (15) is 
shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 5 shows the synchronous 
circuit’s chaotic attractor projected onto the 
xy-plane, xz-plane and yz-plane, respectively. Fig. 
5(d) shows synchronization of the transmitter and 
receiver signals x(t) vs. xr(t). The 45° lines 
indicate that nearly perfect synchronization is 
achieved and remained between the transmitter 
and receiver. Fig. 6 shows the synchronization of 
Lorenz-based circuit with ECG signal. Channel 1 
is original ECG signal, used as a private key, 
channel 2 is the private key under the chaotic 
masking, channel 3 is the recovered private key 
from the receiver. These data were acquired from 
the circuit using a digital oscilloscope.
