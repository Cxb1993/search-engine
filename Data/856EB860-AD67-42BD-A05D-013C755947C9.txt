Abstract 
 This paper considers the stabilization problem of a one-dimensional unstable heat conduction system 
(rod) modeled by a parabolic partial differential equation (PDE), powered with a Dirichlet type actuator from 
one of the boundaries. By applying the Volterra integral transformation, a stabilizing boundary control law is 
obtained to achieve exponential stability in the ideal situation when there are no system uncertainties. The 
associated Lyapunov function is used for designing an infinite-dimensional sliding manifold, on which the 
system exhibits the same type of stability and robustness against certain types of parameter variations and 
boundary disturbances. It is observed that the relative degree of the chosen sliding function with respect to the 
boundary control input is zero. A continuous control law satisfying the reaching condition is obtained by 
passing a discontinuous (signum) signal through an integrator.

ㄧ、前言 
本計畫擬研究兩種二階拋物線式(parabolic)分散參數系統(distributed parameter systems, DPS)，分別
為熱傳導系統(heat conduction systems)以及熱對流系統(diffusion-advection systems)。其動態如以下偏微
分方程式(partial differential equation, PDE)所示： 
Heat Conduction: ( , ) = ( , ) ( , )t xxU x t U x t U x ta b+  (2.1) 
Diffusion-advection: ( , ) = ( , ) ( , )t xx xx t x t x tw ew kw+  (2.2) 
本研究將討論此二系統的邊界控制(boundary control)問題，特別針對可能的系統參數變動(system 
parameter variations)與外來干擾(external disturbances)現象，提出順滑模態控制(sliding mode 
control)的解決方案，使得該二階拋物線式分散參數系統得以在有限的變動與干擾的情況下，仍能維
持穩定性與強健性。

 3.3 順滑流形(sliding manifold)的建構 
 我們將採用 Lyapunov 法來建構無限維度空間中的順滑流形，首先利用 Volterra 積分轉換所獲得的
穩定新座標 ( , )t xw 動態，求取其Lyapunov函數 ( )V t ，接著求取其時間導數 ( ) ( )d V t V t

函數之時間導數為負定(negative definite)之特性，尋找滿足 ( ) 0V t  的可能順滑流形。

選取

 此順滑流形(3.16)有兩大優點，其一，存在連續性控制法則(continuous control)使順滑模態得以在其
上產生，這一點將於下節說明；其二，所產生的順滑模態具有指數穩定(exponentially stable)的特性。我

系統匹配干擾 ( )d t 與 ( )wd t 之直接關係，故可確認系統一旦進入順滑模式，其動態行為將與匹配干擾無

PDE system with parameter variations and boundary uncertainties” 
 
boundary control laws without model truncations. We
will adopt the Lyapunov approach to sliding surface
design (Su et al., 1996) (which was originally devel-
oped for finite-dimensional problems) for this infinite-
dimensional system version. A sliding mode boundary
controller is then designed to achieve system stabiliza-
tion with robustness against certain types of bounded
system parameter variations and exogenous distur-
bances.
We first consider the boundary control problem of a one-
dimensional thermal unstable system in heat conduction
with constant coefficients and subject to the matched
boundary disturbance only. In Section 4, we will further
consider the same problem with parametric variations.
Let U(x, t) be the temperature distribution of a thin rod
of length l with respect to the desired (nominal) value.
The governing equation is a linear second order parabolic
PDE
Ut(x, t) = αUxx(x, t) + βU(x, t), (1)
with x ∈ [0, l], t > 0, and the subscripts denoting the
derivatives. The constant α > 0, corresponding to the
square of the thermal diffusivity, and the destabilizing
reaction parameter β ∈ R, are arbitrary constants. The
homogeneous boundary condition at x = 0 is
U(0, t) = 0. (2)
The control input is applied at the opposite end, x = l,
and is corrupted by an exogenous disturbance d(t). We
consider the Dirichlet boundary actuator
U(l, t) = Q(t) + d(t), (3)
where Q(t) is the control input. The disturbance d(t)
and its first-order time derivative d˙(t) are assumed to be
bounded in the Euclidean norm by known upper bounds
as, ‖d(t)‖ ≤ d¯ and
∥∥∥d˙(t)∥∥∥ ≤ d¯p, where d¯ and d¯p are pos-
itive constants. In particular, for d(t) = Q(t) = 0, sys-
tem (1) can have an arbitrary large number of unstable
eigenvalues for large β/α (Bosˇkovic´ et al., 2001; Cheng
et al., 2009b).
The objective is to regulate this unstable and uncertain
infinite-dimensional system to zero distribution, that
is limt→∞ U(x, t) ≡ 0, for x ∈ [0, l] by using the SMC
methodology. It has been a common understanding
that SMC usually suffers from the “chattering” phe-
nomenon, due to discontinuous control inputs, which
switch with an infinite frequency (Edwards and Spur-
geon, 1998; Hamerlain et al., 2001). Such a chattering
control behavior has to do with the relative degree be-
tween the control variables and the sliding variables.
In this paper, we acquire a sliding manifold that is of
relative degree zero with respect to the boundary con-
trol variable, Q(t). Subsequently, a chattering-reduced
sliding mode boundary control law can be obtained.
2 Construction of sliding surface
2.1 Coordination transformation
We first use the Volterra integral operator to transform
the original problem into a new coordinate system (Jerri,
1985; Liu, 2003; Smyshlyaev and Krstic, 2004)
ω(x, t) = U(x, t)−
∫ x
0
k(x, y)U(y, t)dy, (4)
where k(x, y) is a function of two variables. It is often
referred to as the kernel or nucleus of the integral equa-
tion (Jerri, 1985). The system (1)-(3) is then mapped
into the new coordinates
ωt(x, t) = αωxx(x, t)− cω(x, t), (5)
ω(0, t) = 0, (6)
ω(l, t) = Q(t) + dω(t), (7)
where c > 0 is a free parameter for setting the de-
sired rate of stability. From this point on, we will re-
fer to the PDE system (1)-(3) as the U -system in the
U -coordinates and (5 )-(7) as the ω-system in the ω-
coordinates. Thus, dω(t) of the ω-system is regarded as
the new boundary disturbance matched to the control
input in the ω-coordinates. It is given by
dω(t) = d(t)−
∫ l
0
k(l, y)U(y, t)dy. (8)
To find the kernel function k(x, y), substitute (1)-
(3) into (5)-(7) using the relationship (4) with the
equality ddxk(x, y)
∣∣
y=x
= (kx(x, x) + ky(x, x)) to yield
(Smyshlyaev and Krstic, 2004)
kxx(x, y)− kyy(x, y) = λk(x, y), (x, y) ∈ T , (9)
k(x, 0) = 0, (10)
k(x, x) = −λ
2
x, (11)
where T = {x, y : 0 ≤ y ≤ x ≤ l) and λ = (β+c)/α > 0.
The existence and uniqueness of this integral operator
(4) can be traced back to the works (Colton, 1977; Sei-
dman, 1984). For the hyperbolic PDE system (9)-(11),
it could be reformulated in variables of x+ y and x− y,
similar to the wave equation by using the D’Alembert’s
formula, and then be transformed into the integral equa-
tion (Liu, 2003; Smyshlyaev and Krstic, 2004). Through
the method of successive approximations, the analytical
solution to the kernel function was found in Smyshlyaev
and Krstic (2004) as
k(x, y) = −λy
I1
(√
λ(x2 − y2)
)
√
λ(x2 − y2) , (12)
where the kernel function L(x, y) takes the form similar
to k(x, y)
L(x, y) = −λy
J1
(√
λ(x2 − y2)
)
√
λ(x2 − y2) , (20)
in which J1 is a standard Bessel function of the first
order. Substituting (18) and (20) into (19) yields the
sliding mode response of the U -system (1)-(3) on the
manifold (15)
U(x, t) = 2l

is a constant. With the well-posedness of the kernel (20)
of the inverse backstepping transformation (19) of Liu
(2003) and Smyshlyaev and Krstic (2004), the conver-
gence of the Fourier series in (21) is preserved.
Theorem 1 The U -system (1)-(3) in sliding mode on
the manifold (15) is exponentially stable.
PROOF. The standard Bessel function J1 is bounded.
For a bounded initial distribution u0(x), the terms
within the brackets of (21) are also bounded function
of x. Therefore, U(x, t) has exponential stability as
ω(x, t). 2
Theorem 1 confirms stability of the U -system in the slid-
ing mode (15). Rewrite the sliding manifold (15) in terms
of U(x, t) as
S(t) = Ux(l, t)− k(l, l)U(l, t)−
∫ l
0
kx(l, y)U(y, t)dy.
(22)
Note that this proposed sliding function requires full
state accessibility (measurements throughout the entire
domain ) in general. However, if β ≤ 0, the PDE (1)
is open-loop stable. In this case, the kernel function
k(x, y) is no longer needed for the stabilization purpose.
The sliding manifold (22) can then be assigned with
a zero kernel function; that is k(x, y) = 0, such that
S(t) = Ux(l, t). In this case, a simple point observation
suffices. A stable PDE example is provided in Cheng et
al. (2009a) to illustrate this reasoning.
3 Sliding mode boundary control design
The control objective now is to design the boundary con-
trol law Q(t) to achieve the sliding mode on the slid-
ing manifold S(t) = 0. A general guideline to sliding-
mode control design is to satisfy the η-reaching condi-
tion (Hung et al., 1993; Edwards and Spurgeon, 1998)
S˙(t)S(t) < −η |S(t)| , (23)
where η is a small positive constant. Usually, it takes
a discontinuous control law to achieve the sliding mode
leading to the notorious chattering phenomenon, which
greatly degrades the system performance (Utkin and
Orlov, 1987; Edwards and Spurgeon, 1998). In this study,
however, we observe a special relative degree relation-
ship between the boundary control input and the pro-
posed sliding function S(t). We will show that a contin-
uous sliding mode boundary control law can be obtained
to achieve the sliding mode on the manifold (22) in fi-
nite time ts ≤ |S(0)| /η. With k(l, l) = −λ2 l from (11),
the time derivative of S(t) is obtained as
S˙(t) =
λl
2
Q˙(t) + g(t), (24)
where g(t) ≤ Uxt(l, t) + λl2 d¯p −
∫ l
0
kx(l, y)[αUyy(y, t) +
βU(y, t)]dy lumps all the uncertainties. It is completely
unknown but is assumed to be bounded by a positive
function δ(t) ≥ |g(t)| + η > 0. Equation (24) indicates
that the sliding function S(t) is of relative degree zero
with respect to the control law Q(t). Therefore, we pro-
pose the sliding mode boundary control law as
Q(t) = −K
∫ t
0
sign(S(τ))dτ , (25)
where K is a design switching gain satisfying K >
2
λl [δ(t) + η]. The reaching condition (23) is confirmed
by a direct substitution of the control law (25) into (23)
S˙(t)S(t) =
λl
2
S(t)Q˙(t) + S(t)g(t) ≤ −η |S(t)|
Thus, the system will reach the sliding mode S(t) = 0 in
a finite time ts. Once the system is constrained within
the sliding manifold, an ideal sliding motion takes place
leading to limt→∞ U(x, t) ≡ 0 exponentially.
The switching gain in (25) is assumed sufficiently large
and is satisfied with reaching condition (23), which is
rather conservative.
Figure 1 depicts the control system block diagram. The
sliding mode control law (25) is synthesized by passing
a discontinuous signal, −Ksign(S(t)), into an integra-
tor, H(s) = 1s , where s denotes the Laplace variable.
Therefore, the control signal is continuous, and chatter-
ing phenomenon will practically not occur (Edwards and
Spurgeon, 1998; Hamerlain et al., 2001).

(1)-(3). Furthermore, the system performance is com-
pared with that of the benchmark backstepping con-
troller (BSC)
Q(t) =
∫ l
0
k(l, y)U(y, t)dy, (31)
which was proposed in Liu (2003) and Smyshlyaev and
Krstic (2004).
The heating rod parameters are l = 1m, β =
17/ sec,α = 1m2/ sec, in which one unstable eigen-
value is located at s1 = 7.13. The initial condition is
U(x, 0) = −0.01e6.7x sin(8pix). Two scenarios are con-
sidered here. Case (i) is the unstable heat system with
the matched disturbance d(t). In case (ii), system pa-
rameter variations ∆α and ∆β are added along with
the disturbance d(t). The PDE numerical solver is pro-
grammed by using the finite-difference method.
For case (i), the matched disturbance is d(t) = 2 +
0.25 sin(20t). The design parameters of the two con-
trollers (25) and (31) are initially chosen as c = 2 and
K = 100. It is seen that the proposed sliding mode
controller (SMC) can effectively stabilize this unstable
and uncertain infinite-dimensional system as t→ 1sec.,
while the backstepping controller (BSC) is inferior as il-
lustrated in Figure 3(c). Even when the value of c is in-
creased to as higher as c = 12, the exogenous boundary
disturbance d(t) still degenerate the performance of the
backstepping controller.
In case (ii), 50% in parameter variations (∆α = −0.5 and
∆β = 8.0) are added such that two unstable eigenvalues
arise at s1 = 5.26 and s2 = 20.065. Following the design
constraint (30) for parameter variations, the c value is set
to c = 12 > |α∆β−β∆α|α+∆α = 11 and the K value remains
the same as before. As shown in Figure 4, the proposed
SMC method provides robust performance, while the
BSC controllers fail to reach the goal. It is seen in Figure
4(c) that the BSC with c = 2 fails to stabilize the extra
unstable mode, s2 = 20.065. The BSC with c = 12 can
maintain stability but is still subject to the disturbance
d(t).
Figures 3(b) and 4(b) display the continuity characteris-
tics of the proposed SMC law (25). Both indicate sliding
motions with practically no chattering effects.

Abstract — The paper deals with a state observer design for 
linear systems with disturbances that lie in the control space. We 
propose a pseudo output, Σ(t), to be included in the observer. It is 
found that this pseudo output can be related to the measurable 
output, y(t), by a dynamic mapping which is invariant of the 
disturbances. Using the inverse method, Σ(t) can be retrieved by 
y(t) such that the inaccessible system state can further be 
estimated by means of the proposed dynamic mapping.  
I. INTRODUCTION 
The observer design of a linear time invariant (LTI) system 
subject to unknown inputs (or disturbances) is of great interest 
in the modern control theory. Many works and the references 
therein have been considered to the LTI systems driven by 
both of the known and unknown inputs [1]. In general, the 
observer matching condition (due to the relative degree issue) 
and the stable transmission zeros (if any due to the system 
structure) become the necessary and sufficient conditions not 
only for the existence of most of unknown inputs observers 
(UIOs) but also for the class of sliding mode observers [4]. 
The variable structure control (VSC) theory with full state 
accessibility is widely recognized for its robustness [7]. If the 
system state is not fully accessible, the observer-type variable 
structure controller provides the most general scheme to serve 
the control purposes. More recently, the works in [5]-[6] have 
shown that the relative degree problem of the observer 
matching condition can be weakened. They integrate the class 
of sliding mode observer with a scheme to estimate a certain 
number of derivatives of the output. Thus, both of the system 
state and the unknown inputs can be estimated under certain 
conditions. 
In this paper, we propose to reconstruct the state variables 
by means of a novel mapping relationship. The proposed 
scheme is linear and compatible with the classical variable 
structure controller. By creating an additional artificial output 
for the system that is already equipped with the measurable 
output, two dynamic mappings can be obtained from the 
input-output points of view. The common property of these 
mappings can be examined from the input space (that is, the 
control input plus the disturbances) by way of the system state 
space and finally to the image domains via the designed 
artificial matrix and the innate output matrix, respectively. 
Since these two matrices share the same system dynamics in 
the state space, the related ranges can be viewed as different 
 
Chia-Fu Lin (andy3249@seed.net.tw) and Wu-Chung Su (wcsu@ 
dragon.nchu.edu.tw) are with the Department of Electrical Engineering, 
National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan 402, R.O.C.. 
images of the system dynamics driven by the same inputs. 
Given these two images, the dynamic relationship in between 
them can be directly obtained without both known and 
unknown inputs. Although the pseudo output variables do not 
exist in real, the paper demonstrates that the pseudo output 
and the inaccessible system state can be fully reconstructed 
with the system output alone. 
The motivation of this idea is extended from the authors’ 
preliminary works in [8]-[10]. In [8]-[9], they devoted to the 
study of a mapping relationship between the sliding variable 
and the innate output for a LTI, single-input-single-output 
(SISO) system. The major difference is that the derivation of 
the mapping in [8] is very difficult to be employed for the high 
dimensional multivariable systems. The work in [9] extended 
the observation of [8] by defining a forward mapping and its 
associated inverse mapping between the output and the sliding 
variable. It is a feasible scheme for the study of multivariable 
systems and leads to the result in [10]. All of these methods 
transform the system output into the pre-designed sliding 
surface via a post-filter or a dynamic mapping, which avoids 
using the observer to estimate the unavailable states. On the 
contrary, here we seek to build an UIO by means of the 
mapping relationship. The estimated state is introduced to a 
variable structure controller that can contend with the matched 
disturbance. If the observer matching condition of a given 
system is not satisfied, the conventional UIOs cannot be 
adopted. An alternate method should be considered. In such a 
case, we propose a digital approximation of the mapping to 
overcome the implementation problem. 
II. PROBLEM FORMULATION 
Consider a LTI, multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) system 
( ) ( ) ( ) ( ),x t Ax t Bu t Ev t= + +                 (1a) 
y(t) = Cx(t),                                           (1b) 
where x(t) is the system state, u(t) is the control, v(t) is the 
disturbance, y(t) is system output; A∈ℜn×n, B∈ℜn×m, E∈ℜn×h, 
and C∈ℜl×n are matrices with n > l ≥ m ≥ h. Without loss of 
generality, the matrices B, C, E are assumed to be full rank and 
the system is controllable. If the estimated state of an UIO is 
adopted to serve the control purpose, the limitation on both of 
controllers and UIOs need to be considered simultaneously. 
Here, we consider the case that the matrix E falls into the 
range space of B, i.e. rank [B, E] = rank [B] (the matched 
disturbance) [13]. It implies that there exists a matrix N∈ℜm×h 
such that E = BN and rank(N) = h.

Choose Mg such that MgB = 0(n–m)×m. Hence, Mg and Λ also

transformation denote the related images of (5). They are

ΛV–1 = [0m×(n–m)   Im].                            (12) 
We come up with the following lemma. 
Lemma 2. A forward mapping, denoted as ∆: Σ(t) → y(t), can 
be realized as {Pa, Pb, Pc, Pd} = {MgAeqM, MgAeqB(ΛB)–1, CM, 
CB(ΛB)–1}, where Pa∈ℜ(n–m)×(n–m), Pb∈ℜ(n–m)×m, Pc∈ℜl×(n–m), 
and Pd ∈ℜl×m. 
Proof : 
Define the state vector z(t) = Vx(t) = [z1(t)T   z2(t)T]T in the 
new coordinate, where z1(t)∈ℜn–m, and z2(t)∈ℜm. It is clear 
that an artificial pseudo output of (3) becomes

Note that the lower part of (14) is an identity of

It follows that {Pa, Pb, Pc, Pd} = {MgAeqM, MgAeqB(ΛB)–1, 
CM, CB(ΛB)–1}.                                                                    
■ 
The mapping in (7) appears to be the n-th order at first glance. 
With Lemma 1, we define (8) as a forward mapping with the 
(n–m)-th order. Lemma 2 takes a different perspective from 
the new coordinate V to agree with it in the time domain. It 
means that the proposed forward mapping always exists. The 
work in [10] considered the zero-state response only. In 
general, the superposition principle dose not hold for (8) 
under conditions that combine nontrivial inputs and nontrivial 
initial conditions [2]. Since the mathematical exterior does not 
involve with the known and unknown inputs. This is an 
important fact for an inverse mapping to be undertaken later. 
A. Characteristics and Existence Condition of mapping 
The characteristics of ∆: Σ(t) → y(t) are given hereinafter. 
Corollary 1. The transmission zeros of the forward mapping 
{Pa, Pb, Pc, Pd} coincide with those of full-order {A, B, C}. 
Proof: 
Let σ ∈ ^  be the transmission zeros of {A, B, C}. Using 
Lemma 2, we have

which is the transmission zeros definition of {Pa, Pb, Pc, Pd}. 
■ 
Definition 1. An inherent system {A, B, C} is left invertible if 
and only if it is non-degenerate and l ≥ m [11]. 
Considering a forward mapping, the following lemma gives 
the existence condition of its associated inverse mapping by 
identifying the given inherent system. 
Lemma 3. Consider the following systems, the associated 
inverse of the proposed forward mapping exists. 
(i) The inherent systems {A, B, C} are left invertible; 
(ii) The modified systems {A, B, FC} are left invertible. 
Proof: 
With Corollary 1 and Definition 1, the left invertible {A, B, 
C} indicates that {Pa, Pb, Pc, Pd} is also left invertible. Similar 
result is suitable for the squared down systems {A, B, FC}. 
 ■ 
Hence, an inverse mapping of ∆ exists if assumption 2 or 3 
of a given system holds.  
Remark 1. The designed n – m finite transmission zeros of {A, 
B, Λ} with det(ΛB) ≠ 0 are every eigenvalues of Pa. 
Proof: 
Let σ ∈ ^  be the transmission zeros of {A, B, Λ}. Similarly 
to the derivation of Corollary 1, we can obtain [11]

It can be simplified as rank [Pa – σ In – m] < n – m. It means that 
every eigenvalues of Pa cause [Pa – σ In – m] to lose rank. 
     ■ 
In this paper, we take advantage of the VSC theory to 
design the pseudo output of (3). It is reasonable to assume that 
the eigenvalues of Pa are designed to be the distinct, negative 
real values. With the above results, we add another 
assumption on the design of matrix Λ.

The stability of (29) has been surveyed for the SISO case in 
[9]. In fact, it is also suitable for the MIMO case by changing 
the dimension from SISO to MIMO. It gives the following 
lemma. 
Lemma 6. The eigenvalues of (Qa – TI)–1Qa lie within the unit 
circle if no eigenvalues of Qa lie in the right-hand half of the 
complex plane [9]. 
With Lemma 6, the discrete-time inverse compensator (29) 
can result ˆ ˆ ( )k t kTt =Σ = Σ to approach ( )k t kTt =Σ =Σ  
asymptotically. Substituting error signal ( ) t kTe tΣ =  into (25), 
the convergence of ( )x t kTe t =  can be achieved with O(T) 
approximation error.

where K is a positive gain. This type of control input is known 
to satisfy the reaching condition with a properly designed gain

evaluate the closed-loop performance. By introducing the

In VSC theory, the bound assumption of v(t) is necessary 
for designing K. With the output information only, we need 
the following assumption further. 
Assumption 5. The unknown initial vector z1(t0) is bounded to 
a known value. 
Note that assumption 5 is used only for the control purpose. 
With (27), if the positive gain K2 is designed to satisfy

scheme is assured. In case (ii), let ˆ ˆ( )k t kTx x t =Λ = Λ  denote the 
estimated result with (29). We can obtain the similar result 
with O(T) approximation error in [9].
