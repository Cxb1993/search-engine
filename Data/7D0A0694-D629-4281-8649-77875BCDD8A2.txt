ABSTRACT 
In this study, three mole ratios of MDI: DMPA: PTMG (4.0: 1.5: 0.5; 4.0: 1.0: 1.0; and 4.0: 
0.5: 1.5) were employed to polymerize the low molecular weight polyurethane (LMWPU) sols 
(SPU1, SPU2, and SPU3, respectively), which were confirmed with FTIR. The average 
molecular weights of the three LMWPUs are within the range of 2000 to 3800 g/mole, and the 
particle sizes for the three LMWPU sols are within the range of 140 to 1140 nm. The values of 
water remaining of the after-treated non-woven fabrics for the three LMWPU sols are ranked in 
the series of SPU3 > SPU2 > SPU1 for a given add-on value, this is agreeing to the rank of the 
PTMG contained in LMWPU sols. The results reveal that the lower degree of the blocking 
between the gaps of fibers and the decreasing of the crystal of resin deposited on the fibers could 
improve the water remaining property significantly.

Introduction 
The grassing of gardening is becoming a very important factor for sale a house in the area of 
Asia in recent years. Additionally, the engineering of river and road3-6 also need a large amount 
of reinforcing and grassing to prevent the washout of soil and ground. Non-woven fabric could 
do a good job on those fields for its high porous structure and high tangle property between fibers 
to aught a high water permeation and resist the dispersion (disintegrate) of the cover (or 
reinforcing) materials (non-woven fabrics), therefore to possess a well performance and a well 
result of grassing.  
There is one interesting field for the use of non-woven fabric, which is the arboricultural 
engineering, such as planting of vegetation. Some invesgations7-9 paid their attention on the 
degradation of grid materials. Other studies10-11 revealed the improvement of seeding of 
cultivation. The previous investigation1 pointed out that a well structure of vegetation planting 
block could improve the growth of vegetation. This structure of vegetation planting block was 
formed by five layers those were original soil, first non-woven, grid of plastic, second non-woven, 
and soil containing small stone particle layers. The grid of plastic layer was used as drainage. The 
roots of the vegetation on the soil layer will penetrate through the first non-woven fabric layer 
and also through the second non-woven layer. If the non-woven layer is a highly hydrophobic 
layer, the penetration of the roots of the vegetation will be undesired. The higher water remaining 
property and larger pore structure of the non-woven layer, which provides the more suitable 
environment for the penetration of the roots of vegetation, will have the higher benefit for the 
up-growth of vegetation on the layer of original soil. In general, the methods for improving the 
water remaining of polyester (PET) non-woven fabrics were the blending of hydrophilic cellulose 
fibers to PET fibers or the addition of hydrophilic surfactant onto the surface of the PET fibers. 
However, the former has the significant decreasing on the strength of the non-woven fabrics and 
the latter has only the temporary effect. In another case, the use of alkali agents could hydrolyze 
PET fibers to create the rough pore on the fiber surface, but they decrease the strength of 
non-woven fabric significantly. Wang2 used the pad-baking after-treatment of the emulsions of 
water-soluble PU can improve the water remaining properties of the treated PET non-woven 
fabrics and have no effect on the strength of the non-woven fabric. Wang pointed out that the 
water remaining property of the after-treated non-woven fabrics with water soluble polyurethane 
(PU) containing citric acid could improve the water remaining property obviously. The containing 
of citric acid could also improve the degradable of PU molecules to further increase the water 
remaining values. In addition, the distribution of PU molecules in/on the treated non-woven 
fabrics could significantly affect the values of water remaining property.  
In this study, we used 2,2-bis(hydroxymethy)propionic acid (DMPA) as a carboxylic acid 
group containing monomer to co-react with diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) and 
polytetramethyleneglycol (PTMG) under three ratios of DMPA and PTMG to form the various 
 4
calibration curve was obtained by seven standards from molecular weight 265 to 3420. The 
carrier solvent was THF at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min.  
 
Particle size distribution analysis 
    The three sols of LMWPU (SPU1, SPU1, and SPU3) were diluted to about 2 wt% with 
de-ionized distilled water, treated under ultra-sound for 5 minutes, and then put into the quartz 
cell (about 4 ml) to be measured with a particle size analyzer of LB550 (HORIBA, Germany). 
 
After-treatment of non-woven fabrics 
PET non-woven fabric samples were twice padded under 2.0 kg/m2 to obtain an even pickup 
from the freshly prepared LMWPU emulsions and sols. Padding emulsions contained various 
concentrations of LMWPU. Padded fabric samples were then baked at 135°C for 30 min, washed 
with tap water to wash out the unfixed LMWPU resin, and finally dried. 
 
Water remaining and add-on test 
The values of water remaining of the treated fabrics were determined using the method of 
CNS L3233. The values of add-on were calculated by the following equation. 
Add-on (%) = (A－B)/B × 100%                     (1) 
Where, the values of A and B are the weight after and before treatment, respectively. 
 
Observation of optical microscope and scanning electron microscope 
To confirm the distribution of LMWPU on the treated non-woven fibers, the PET 
non-woven fabric samples were padded with various concentrations of LMWPU sols containing 
1 wt % of C.I. Solvent red 6 or emulsions containing 1 wt % of C.I. Direct red 111, baked at 
135°C for 30 min, and then were washed and dried. The distribution of PU on the surface from 
the cross section of the treated non-woven fabrics were observed with LEO 1530 Field Emission 
Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM, LEO-1530 Schottky FESEM, Oberkochen, German). The 
direct and disperse red dye was experimented and selected to stain PU resin for the convenience 
of observation. 
 
Wide Angle X-Ray Diffraction  
    The wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) was determined using a X-ray Powder 
Diffractometer XRD (MXP18, MAC Science, Yokohama, Japan) equipped with a Ni-filtered 
CuKα radiation operated at 40 kV and 30 mA. Each sample with 3.0 mm thickness was 
maintained stationary and scanned in the reflection mode from 2 to 35° at a scanning rate of 2°
/min. 
 
Results and Discussion 
    In this study, three sets of mole ratio of MDI: DMPA: PTMG (4.0: 1.5: 0.5; 4.0: 1.0: 1.0; 
and 4.0: 0.5: 1.5, respectively) were employed to polymerize the low molecular weight 
polyurethane (LMWPU) emulsions were defined as EPU1, EPU2, and EPU3, respectively. Those 
polymers were then dissolved in LiCl/THF to form the sols and were defined as SPU1, SPU2, 
and SPU3, respectively. Those three emulsions and sols of LMWPUs were confirmed with FT-IR 
and are shown in Figure 1 and 2, respectively. From Figure 1, it can be found that the absorption 
bands of ester (－COO－) at about 1220 cm-1, amide (－CO-NH－) at about 1540 cm-1 and 
1670 cm-1, carboxylic acid (－COOH) at about 1730 cm-1, the ion of carboxylic acid (－COO－) 
at about 1600 cm-1, and ether (－CH2－O－CH2－) at about 1060 cm-1 and 1105 cm-1.12 In 
addition, from the comparison of the strength of the absorption bands between carboxylic acid 
(－COOH) at about 1730 cm-1 and amide (－CO-NH－) at about 1670 cm-1, it can be found that 
the ratio of the strength of carboxylic acid group and amide group is decreasing in the series of 
EPU1 > EPU2 > EPU3. The carboxylic acid group containing monomer of MPA for those three 
polymers was in the rank of EPU1 > EPU2 > EPU3, consequently the ratio of the strength of 
carboxylic acid group and amide group is in the series of EPU1 > EPU2 > EPU3. Those results

water remaining values of the after-treated fabrics. After that the water remaining values of the 
treated non-woven fabrics are increased with the increasing of the add-on values of LMWPU. 
This phenomenon at the initial stage is mainly attributed to the blocking effect of the LMWPUs 
on/in the non-woven fabric, but the latter stage is mainly caused by the higher hydrophilic 
property of the LMWPUs having the water soluble group of －COOH and －COO－ groups. 
The previous study2 distinctly show this blocking effect for that the gaps between fibers were 
occupied by the treating agents in those cases. This blocking effect surely decreases the water 
remaining ability of non-woven fabric. However, the water remaining values of the after-treated 
fabrics in this study have higher water remaining percentage (104.5% of pristine non-woven) than 
that of the previous study2 (55.2% of pristine non-woven). This result probably causes by the 
higher water remaining ability attributed to the carboxylic acid group (－COOH) and carboxylic 
acid ion group (－COO－) of LMWPU sols than that of commercial water soluble PU and the 
lower blocking effect of LMWPU sols attributed to the lower molecular weight.  
The values of water remaining property for the LMWPU emulsions treated non-woven 
fabrics listed in Table III are also used to compare the values of water remaining property. From 
the data presented in Table III and Figure 5, it can be seen that the tendencies for LMWPU 
emulsions are similar to those for LMWPU sols, but the water remaining property for LMWPU 
emulsions is lower than that for LMWPU sols. The dramatically higher water remaining for 
LMWPU sols might be attributed to the lower aggregation property of LMWPU sols than that of 
LMWPU emulsions.  
On the other hand, the water remaining values for the three types of LMWPU sols are 
ranked in the series of SPU3 > SPU2 > SPU1 for a given add-on value (Figure 5). Again, this 
result is dramatically different from that of our prediction. It is known that the groups of －
COOH and －COO－ (DMPA) have higher hydrophilic property than that the group of ether 
(PTMG). In order to confirm the factor that affects the value of water remaining in this study. The 
structural characterizations were examined and tried to explain this phenomenon. 
For the purpose of realizing the agent distribution of LMWPU in/on the treated non-woven 
fabrics, the pristine non-woven fabrics, 3.2% SPU1 treated and 4% EPU1 treated non-woven 
fabrics were cut into a small piece along with the cross-section and observed with scanning 
electron microscope (SEM). Those pictures are shown in Figures 6a, 6b, and 6c, respectively and 
show the clear surface of the pristine non-woven fabrics; the slight blocking of SPU1 and small 
particle of resin aggregation; and the more obvious blocking of EPU1. The higher blocking for 
EPU1 might be caused by the higher aggregation of EPU1 than SPU1. It is well known that the 
particle of sol state is extreme lower than that of emulsion.  
Further, the agent distribution of LMWPU in/on the SPU1, SPU2, and SPU3 (12%) treated 
non-woven fabrics are shown in Figures 7a, 7b, and 7c, respectively. The pictures show that the 
fiber surface of the SPU3 treated non-woven fabric has a thin film of resin and some small 
particles are adhered; the fiber surface of the SPU2 treated non-woven fabric deposits some 
particle; and the fiber surface of the SPU1 treated non-woven fabric deposits some larger particle. 
Another information obtained from those figures is the significant even agent distribution for 
SPU3 treated non-woven fabric. Those results adumbrate the water remaining value is relating to 
the agent distribution in/on the treated non-woven fabrics.  
For comparison the above results in Figure 7, the EPU1, EPU2, and EPU3 were used to 
treat the non-woven fabrics, the agent distribution conditions are shown in Figure 8a, 8b, and 8c, 
respectively. Those pictures also reveal the same tendencies for SPUs. However, the blocking 
between fibers for EPUs is more significant than that for SPUs. This phenomenon probably 
attributes to the higher aggregation of EPUs than SPUs. 
     In order to confirm the structural difference of the solid state among the three synthesized 
low molecular weight polyurethanes, the wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) patterns are 
examined, which can clearly distinct the difference of crystal among SPU1, SPU2, and SPU3. 
They are shown in Figures 9 (a), 9(b), and 9(c), respectively. One of the interesting findings from 
Figure 9 is that the intensity of X-ray diffraction for SPU3 is significantly lower than that for 
SPU1 and SPU2. They are in the rank of SPU1 > SPU2 > SPU3. This phenomenon reveals that
