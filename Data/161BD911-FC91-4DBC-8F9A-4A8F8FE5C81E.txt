Recently, the fuzzy-neural-network-based control techniques have been used as an alternative design method for 
identification and control of dynamic systems [6-8]. The key element of the fuzzy neural network is the capability of 
approximating mapping through choosing adequately learning method. Though the control performances in [6-8] are 
acceptable, the learning algorithm only includes the parameter learning phase, and they have not considered the 
structure learning phase of the neural network. If the number of the fuzzy rules is chosen too large, the computation 
loading is heavy so that they are not suitable for online practical applications. If the number of the fuzzy rules is 
chosen too small, the learning performance may be not good enough to achieve desired control performance. 
To solve this problem, several self-organizing fuzzy neural networks (SOFNNs) have been developed [9]. The 
self- organizing approach demonstrates the property of automatically generating rules of fuzzy neural networks 
without the preliminary knowledge. In general, a new membership function is generated when a new input signal is 
too far away from the current clusters, and an existing rule is canceled when the fuzzy rule is insignificant [9]. 
Recently, the SOFNNs have been adopted widely for the control of complex dynamic systems [10-12]. Some of 
them use the gradient descent method to derive the parameter learning algorithms [10]; however, stability analysis 
has not been performed yet. Some of them use the Lyapunov function to derive the parameter learning algorithms; 
however, the complex design procedure is not suitable for practical applications [11, 12]. 
In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control system, a real-car experimental setup should be applied. 
However, there must have spent much time, manpower and money to build or to conserve the equipment. The 
virtual-reality (VR) technique can solve the all above problem [13]. The VR technology is applied to make the 
operators believe they are in a different geographic location with different velocity and orientation than they have in 
the real world [13]. 
This project describes the technologies for a flexible automated platoon. First, this project proposed an 
asymmetric self-organizing fuzzy neural network (ASOFNN) with the asymmetric Gaussian membership functions. 
The structure adaptation is described as follows. A new rule of ASOFNN is generated when a new input signal is too 
far from the current clusters. If the fuzzy rule of ASOFNN is insignificant, it will be removed to reduce the 
computation load. Thus, the ASOFNN can self- organizing the fuzzy rules online to achieve an optimal network 
structure. Then, an intelligent car-following control (ICFC) system is proposed. The adaptation laws of the ICFC 
system are derived in the sense of Lyapunov stability theorem, thus the stability of the closed-loop control system 
can be guaranteed. Finally, two simulation scenarios (one-vehicle following scenario and multi-vehicles following 
scenario) are examined to verify the effectiveness of the proposed ICFC system though Matlab and VR simulation, 
respectively. 
II.  PROBLEM FORMULATION 
Figure 1 describes a platoon of N vehicles following a lead vehicle on a straight lane of highway. The position of 
the rear bumper of the ith vehicle with respect to a fixed reference point O on the road is denoted by ix . The 
position of the lead vehicle’s rear bumper with respect to the same fixed reference point is denoted by lx . From the 
platoon configuration, the spacing error ie  can be written as [1]

where iH  denotes the safety spacing of the ith vehicle in the platoon. In the following, the variables and parameters 
are assumed to be associated with the ith vehicle, unless subscripts indicate otherwise. The dynamics of the car 
following system for the vehicle in a platoon are modeled as follows [1]

where M  is the total number of membership functions with respect to the respective input node and ijm , 
l
ijσ , and 
r

the i-th input linguistic variable ix , respectively. And, the associated fuzzy rule can be obtain as

where TNwww ]     [ 21 L=w  and =φ TN ]      [ 21 φφφ L . 
B. Structure Learning 
In the structure growing process, the mathematical description of the existing rules can be expressed as a cluster. 
Each cluster in the product space of the input-output data represents a rule in the rule base. The firing strength of a 
rule for each incoming data ix  can be represented as the degree that the incoming data belong to the cluster [9]. If 
the value of firing strength is too small, it represents that the input value is on the edge of range of the existing 
membership functions. Under this situation, the output will cause an unsatisfactory performance. Therefore, a new 
membership function and a new fuzzy rule should be generated to improve the performance. According to the above 
mention, the firing strength obtained from (9) is used as the degree measure 
 kk φβ = , )(...,,2,1 tNk =  (14)  
where )(tN  is the number of the existing fuzzy rules at the time t. Find the maximum degree maxβ  defined as 
 ktNk ββ )(1max max≤≤= . (15)  
It can be observed that the maximum degree maxβ  is small when the incoming data is far away from the universe of 
discourse of fuzzy rules. If thG≤maxβ  is satisfied, where )1,0(∈thG  is a pre-given threshold, a new membership 
function is generated. The mean and the standard deviation of the new membership function and the fuzzy rule are 
selected as follows 
 i

 0=neww  (19)  
where ix  is the new incoming data and iσ  is a pre-specified constant. The number )(tN  is incremented 
 1)()1( +=+ tNtN . (20)  
To avoid the unbounded growing of network structure and the overload computation load, the structure pruning 
algorithm is developed to eliminate irrelevant fuzzy rules. When the r-th firing strength rβ  is smaller than the 
threshold value thP , it means that the relationship becomes weak between the input and the r-th rule, then the 
significant index of r-th fuzzy rules will be decayed. When the r-th firing strength rβ  is larger than the threshold 
value thP , it means that the incoming inputs fall into the range of the r-th fuzzy rule under this situation, then the 
significant index of r-th fuzzy rules will be risen. The significance index is determined for the importance of the r-th 
rules can be given as

where h  is a vector of higher-order terms, mmm ˆ~ * −= , l*ll σσσ ˆ~ −=  and r*rr σσσ ˆ~ −= . Substituting (25) into 
(24), (24) can be rewritten as

IV.  ICFC SYSTEM DESIGN 
The proposed ICFC system is comprised of a neural controller and a robust controller as shown in Fig. 3, where a 
tracking error index is defined as 
 τdekekekes t∫+++= 0123 &&& . (27)  
The neural controller using the ASOFNN is designed to mimic an ideal controller, and the robust controller is 
designed to compensate for the approximation error between the neural controller and the ideal controller. The 
control law of the intelligent car-following control (ICFC) system is taken as 
 rcnc uuu +=  (28)  
where ncu  is the neural controller and rcu  is the robust controller. Substituting (28) into (4) and using (5) and (27), 
yields 
 )( * rcnc uuugs −−=& . (29)  
From (26), the error equation can be rewritten as 
 =s& rcTTTT u−++++ εwφσwφσwφmφw rl σrσlm ˆ~ˆ~ˆ~ˆ~ . (30)  
To dispel the effect of minimum approximation error ε , the robust controller is chosen as 
 sEurb κ+= ˆ  (31)  
where Eˆ  is the estimated value of ε , and κ  is a positive constant. To guarantee the stability of the ICFC system, 
the Lyapunov function candidate is defined as

Fig. 4. LV’s acceleration and velocity time profile for scenario 2. 
 
For both scenarios (scenario 1 and scenario 2), the control parameters of the ICFC system are selected as 21 =k , 
52 =k , 43 =k , 1000=wη , 10=== rlm σσ ηηη , 1=Eη , 0.1=iσ , 5.0=thG , 1.0=thP , 01.021 ==ττ  and 
01.0=thI . These parameters are chosen through some trials to achieve satisfactory transient control performance. The 
simulation results of scenario 1 are shown in Fig. 5. From the simulation results, it can be seen that the proposed the 
ICFC system can achieve satisfactory performance for the one-vehicle following system even in the change of the 
safety spacing command. The simulation results of scenario 2 are shown in Fig. 6. From the simulation results, it can 
be seen that the proposed the ICFC system can also achieve satisfactory performance even in the changes of 
acceleration and velocity of the LV.
