junction resistance [8]. In our previous work [6], although a CE 
current gain of -100 was observed from the gummel plot, the IC 
V,, Family curves did show corresponding CLI~VCS for circuit appli- 
cations. To date, the best measured current gain in AlGaN/GaN 
HBTs is only 10 [5],  which IS no better than the current gain (p = 
12) in the homojunction BJT [9]. 
In this Letter, the low temperature common emitter 1,- VcL 
curves in AlGaN/GaN graded emitter HBTs was studied to under- 
stand the barrier issues related to the low CE current gain of a 
GaN HBT. For the same base current I ,  = 15pA and biased volt- 
age V,, = 50V. the collector current increases from IC = 169p.A at 
295K to I ,  = 411pA at 190K. The increase in collector current 
and CE current gain at lower temperature can be attributed to the 
reduced base recombination current, which is due to the carrier 
traps associated with defect (dislocation) centres in the base-emit- 
ter junction.

MOCVD mateerid growth Lind device fuhvicntion: The Alo,,G+,,N/ 
GaN HBT structures were grown by low pressure MOCVD on c- 
plane (0001) sapphire substrates. An n-type subcollector was first 
grown and followed by an unintentionally doped (UID) collector 
and a 150nmy-type Mg+ base layer. The bottom 4nm of the emit- 
ter layer is Si-doped AlGaN with a graded alloy composition .Y = 
0.0-0.1. An n + - G a N S  conhct layer was then grown on top of the 
emitter layer. The carrier concentrations for the emitter, base and 
collector are estimated to be n - 5 x p - 2 x loL7 and n - 9 x 
1016cm- 3 ,  respectively, while the collector and emitter contact lay- 
ers are n - 2 x lOI9cm 3, as measured by the Hall effect on bulk 
layers grown under similar conditions. The device process starts 
with emitter layer etching to minimise dry etching damage in the 
base layer; the emitter mesa was defined by ion cyclotron plasma 
(ICP) etching using Cl2 as the etching species. The base metal m i /  
Au) was then deposited to prevent possible damage from subse- 
quent etching. Next, the base and collector laycrs were etched by 
chemical assist ion beam etching (CAIBE). Finally, the emitter 
and collector metal (TilAlffiiAu) was deposited and the sample 
was then alloyed. The SEM micrograph of a HBT device is shown 
in Fig. I .  
Device perfornume nt room fenywuture: We first present thc com- 
mon emitter lc-VcE curves at room temperature. The emitter size 
is 30 x 120,m2. As shown in Fig. 2, the CE current gain (AIc/AZB) 
is IO to 12. The conunon emitter breakdown voltage is greater 
than 42V.

Device performance at low temperature: The current gain of 10 to 
12 in AICaN/GaN HBTs reported so far is comparable to the cur- 
rent gain of 12 in GaN BJTs and is much lower than the current 
gain of 40 to 60 in InCaP/GaAs HBT [IO, 111. The surface recom- 
bination current on the base layer [7] should not be the dominant 
factor for the large emitter aredperimeter (AIP = 3600pm2/300pm 
= 12) ratio HBTs. Hence, the major loss of base current is due to 
the reduction in the number of effective recombination centres 
(traps) in the emitter base junction [12]. To validate our assump- 
tion, a low temperature measurement of the GaN HBT was con- 
ducted in order to decrease the number of traps via the 
neutralisation of the recombination centres at lower temperature. 
Figs. 30 and b show the common emitter IC against VcE curves at 
295 and 190K, respectively. The input base current Is ranges from 
0 to 15@, in 3pA steps. For the same base current IB = l5pA 
and biased voltage V,, = 50V, the collector current increases 
from IC: = 169@ at 295K to I ,  = 411pA at 190K. We also 
observed an increase in the offset voltage when the temperature 
was decreased (VcEcfl = 8V at 295K; VCEofl = 15V at 190K). The 
increase of VcEof, at  lower temperature can be related to an 
increase of V B E  as the base bulk current is increased and the 
reduction of the ideality factor tzBE as recombination current is less 
dominant. Since the extrinsic base resistance is too large, the ideal- 
ity factor cannot be specified from the gummel plots. 
Conclusion: We have compared the measured current gain-base 
current p-lo curves of AlGaNiGaN HBTs and InGaWGaAs HBTs 
[lo]. In InGaWGaAs HBTs, the P-I, curves show a slight decrease 
in current gain with temperature, which results from the reduction 
in the base intrinsic concentration nhi. However, the current gain 
in AIGaN/GaN HBTs increases significantly at lower temperature. 
This result confirms our assumption that the increase i n  current 
gain at lower temperature is caused by a reduction in base recom- 
bination current.
