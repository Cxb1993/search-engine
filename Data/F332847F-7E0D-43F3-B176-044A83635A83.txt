1ABSTRACT
The applied heat flux on the drilling surface of drilling tool is estimated in the
present three-dimensional inverse heat conduction problem. The inverse algorithm
utilizing the Steepest Descent Method (SDM) and a general purpose commercial code
CFX4.4 is applied successfully in this study based on the simulated and measured
temperature distributions with time at four sensors embedded on the drilling surfaces.
The numerical experiments are considered at the first stage to illustrate the validity of
inverse determination of the unknown heat flux using exact and error measurements.
Experimental data are then used to estimate the actual heat flux along the drilling edge
at two different drill peripheral cutting speeds. Results of both the numerical and
experimental examinations show that the reliable estimated heat flux can be obtained
by using the present inverse algorithm.

3between the workpiece and tool depend strongly on these heat fluxes. However, direct
measurement of temperature at the tool-chip interface using traditional type sensors is
impossible due to the cutting movement and the presence of the chip. Due to the fact
that the direct sensing of the tool-chip interface temperature is difficult, the use of the
techniques of inverse heat conduction problems is a good alternative since this
technique takes into account temperatures measured from accessible positions.
The 3-D inverse problems for an irregular domain are still limited in the
literature. The technique of the 3-D inverse problems of irregular domain in utilizing
an iterative inverse algorithm together with the commercial code CFX4.4 [6] has been
developed by Huang and Wang [7] who applied the inverse algorithm to estimate the
unknown surface heat fluxes in a 3-D solid. By following the similar technique,
Huang and Chen [8] estimated the unknown boundary heat flux in a 3-D inverse heat
convection problem and Huang and Cheng [9] predicted the heat generation rate of
chips on a PC board. Huang et al. [10] developed the technique of Steepest Descent
Method (SDM) and commercial code CFX4.4 to estimate the local convective heat
transfer coefficients over fin surface in a steady-state 3-D inverse heat conduction
problem based on the simulated temperature measurements by infrared thermography.
More recently, Huang and Lo [11] applied the similar technique to estimate the
applied heat flux on the cutting edges for the cutting tools.
However the 3-D inverse heat conduction problem in estimating the heat flux
along the drilling edges for the drilling tool has not been examined. The objective of
this study is to extend the techniques used in [7-11] to a transient 3-D inverse drilling
problem in estimating the time-dependent heat flux along the drilling edges based on
the measured tool temperatures.
The Steepest Descent Method derives basis from the perturbational principle [12]
and transforms the inverse problem to the solution of three problems, namely, the
direct problem, the sensitivity problem and the adjoint problem, which will be
discussed in detail in the next few sections.
5solution for the above 3-D heat conduction problem in the domain(x,y,z) with time
t is solved using CFX4.4 and its Fortran subroutine USRBCS.
2. THE INVERSE PROBLEM
For the inverse problem considered here, the time-dependent heat flux q(t) is
regarded as being unknown, but everything else in equation (1) is known. In addition,
the temperature readings using traditional contact type sensors at some proper
locations are available.
Let the temperature readings taken by the sensors at the measurement locations
be denoted by Y(xm,ym,zm,t)Ym(t), here m = 1 to M and M represents the number of
sensors, and (xm,ym,zm) indicates the measurement positions. This inverse problem can
be stated as follows: by utilizing the above mentioned measured temperature data
Ym(t), estimate the unknown time-dependent heat flux q(t).
The solution of this inverse problem is to be obtained in such a way that the
following functional is minimized:
ft M 2
m m
m 1t 0
J[q(t)] [T (t) Y (t)] dt

  (2)
here, Tm(t) are the estimated or computed temperatures at the temperature
measurement locations (xm,ym,zm) and time t. These quantities are determined from
the solution of the direct problem given previously by using the estimated heat flux
q(t).
3. STEEPEST DESCENT METHOD FOR MINIMIZATION
An iterative process based on the following steepest descent method [12] is
applied for the estimation of unknown heat flux q(t) by minimizing the functional
J[q(t)]
n 1 n n nq (t) q (t) P (t)   ; for n = 0, 1, 2 (3)
Heren is the search step size from iteration n to iteration n+1, and Pn(t) is the
surface averaged direction of descent (i.e. search direction) given by
7where 1nq  is replaced by the expression given by equation (3). If temperature
n n n
mT (t;q P ) is linearized by a Taylor’s expansion, equation (6) takes the form

where nmT (t;q ) is the solution of the direct problem at (xm,ym,zm) and t by using the
estimate heat flux for the exact heat flux. The sensitivity functions nmT (t;P ) are
taken as the solutions of problem (5) at the measured positions (xm,ym,zm) and time t
by using nPq . The search step size n is determined by minimizing the
functional given by equation (7) with respect ton . The following expression is the
result ofn .

To obtain the adjoint problem, equation (1a) is multiplied by the Lagrange
multiplier (or adjoint function) (,t) and the resulting expression is integrated over
the correspondent space and time domains. Then the result is added to the right hand
side of equation (2) to yield the following expression for the functional J[q(t)]:

where() is the Dirac delta function and (xm,ym,zm) refers to the measured positions.
The variation J can be obtained by perturbing q by q+q and T by T+T in
equation (9), subtracting the resulting expression from the original equation (9) and
neglecting the second-order terms. We thus find
9where is a small-specified number. However, the observed temperature data may
contain measurement errors. Therefore, the functional equation (2) is not expected to
be equal to zero at the final iteration step. As per the experiences of the authors [7-12],
the discrepancy principle as the stopping criterion is used in this study, i.e. it is
assumed that the temperature residuals may be approximated by
m mT (t) Y (t) ; m = 1 to M (16)
where is the standard deviation of the measurements, which is assumed to be a
constant. Substituting equation (16) into equation (2), the following expression is
obtained for the stopping criterion:
2
fM t  (17)
The stopping criterion is given by equation (15) with determined from
equation (17).
4. COMPUTATIONAL PROCEDURE
The computational procedure for the solution of this inverse problem using
steepest descent method may be summarized as follows:
Suppose nq (t) is available at iteration n.
Step 1. Solve the direct problem given by equation (1) for T(,t).
Step 2. Examine the stopping criterion given by equation (15) withgiven by
equation (17). Continue if not satisfied.
Step 3. Solve the adjoint problem given by equation (11) for(,t).
Step 4. Compute the gradient of the functional J from equation (14).
Step 5. Compute the direction of descent Pn from equations (4).
Step 6. Setq = Pn, and solve the sensitivity problem given by equation (5) for
T(,t).
Step 7. Compute the search step sizen from equation (8).
Step 8. Compute the new estimation for 1+nq from equation (3) and return to
step 1.

Thermocouples were covered with cement (Omega OB-400) to secure the position
and prevent the contact with workpiece.
Two drilling tests were conducted at two spindle speeds, 780 and 2350 rpm,
which correspond to 24.4 and 73.2 m/min drill peripheral cutting speeds, respectively.
The feed was fixed at 0.051 mm/rev or 0.025 mm for each tooth of the two-flute drill.
All experiments were conducted dry without cutting fluid.
6. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
The objective of this study is to show the validity of the SDM in predicting the
unknown time-dependent heat flux along the drilling edges for a 3-D drilling tool with
no prior information on the functional form of the unknown quantities. The physical
model for this problem is described as follows: All experiments were conducted dry
without cutting fluid, therefore wh = h = 30 W/(m
2-K).
6.1 Numerical Experiments
To illustrate the ability of the SDM in predicting q(t) with inverse analysis from
the knowledge of the simulated measured temperature distributions at the measured
positions (xm,ym,zm), we consider the following numerical test cases.
One of the advantages of using the SDM is that the initial guesses of the
unknown heat fluxes q(t) can be chosen arbitrarily. In all the test cases considered
here, the initial guesses for heat fluxes are taken as q(t) = 0.0.
In order to compare the results for situations involving random measurement
errors, we assume normally distributed uncorrelated errors with zero mean and
constant standard deviation. The simulated inexact measurement data Ym can be
expressed as
Ym = Ym,exact+ (18)
where Ym,exact is the solution of the direct problem with the exact heat flux; is the
standard deviation of the measurements; andis a random variable that generated by
subroutine DRNNOR of the IMSL [15], is within -2.576 to 2.576 for a 99%
confidence bound.
13
The inverse calculation is then proceeded to consider the situation of inexact
temperature measurements. The standard deviation of the measurement error is first
taken as= 2oC, then it is increased to= 5oC.
For = 2oC, 20 iterations are needed to satisfy the stopping criterion based on
the discrepancy principle, the exact and estimated heat fluxes are shown in Figure 6a.
The relative errors for the heat fluxes and temperatures are calculated as ERRq =
3.39%, ERRT1 = 0.51%, ERRT2 = 0.514%, ERRT3 = 0.436% and ERRT4 = 0.431%,
respectively. For = 5oC, the number of iterations to satisfy the stopping criterion is
only 14, the exact and estimated heat fluxes are shown in Figure 6b, and the relative
errors for heat flux and temperatures are calculated as ERRq = 6.28%, ERRT1 =
1.08%, ERRT2 = 0.982%, ERRT3 = 1.07% and ERRT4 = 1.07%, respectively.
It can be learned based on the above numerical results that the estimated heat
fluxes are still reliable when using four sensor measurements and considering error
measurements.
6.2 Experimental Analysis:
In order to show the practical applications for the present inverse algorithm to
the inverse drilling problem in estimating the applied heat flux for a drill, the
measured temperature at four sensors as stated in section 5 are utilized. Two cases are
considered here (1) temperatures obtained at TC1, TC2 and TC3 are used as the
measured temperatures, while the temperatures measured at TC4 is used as the
purpose of verification; (2) temperatures obtained at TC1, TC3 and TC4 are used as
the measured temperatures, while the temperatures measured at TC2 is used as the
checking temperature. Finally, the inverse solutions obtained by the above two cases
will be compared.
The ambient and water temperatures, T and Tw, are taken as the initial
measured temperature of the drill at TC1 for all the inverse calculations considered in
the section of experimental analysis. First, the estimated heat flux q at the spindle
speed 780 rpm, which correspond to 24.4 m/min drill peripheral cutting speed, based
on the temperature measurements at (TC1,TC2,TC3) and (TC1,TC3,TC4),
15
11c, respectively. The relative errors at TC1, TC2 and TC3 are calculated as ERRT1 =
3.22%, ERRT2 = 5.57% and ERRT3 = 2.33%, respectively.
The temperature at TC4 is calculated for the purpose of verification by using the
estimated heat flux. The comparison of the measured and calculated temperatures at
TC4 is plotted in Figure 11d. The relative error is calculated as ERRT4 = 5.29%.
The measured and estimated temperatures at TC1, TC3 and TC4 are illustrated
in Figures 12a, 12b and 12c, respectively. The comparison of the measured and
calculated temperatures at TC2 is plotted in Figure 12d. The relative errors at TC1,
TC3, TC4 and TC2 are calculated as ERRT1 = 1.68%, ERRT3 = 2.90%, ERRT4 =
3.21% and ERRT2 = 7.39%, respectively.
Again, due to the increasing of the applied torque, the estimated heat flux is
increased in the beginning of drilling. Thereafter the heat flux is decreased till the
penetration of the working piece. The applied total can be obtained by multiplying the
estimated q with the heat applying area -7 21.275 10 m .
It may be of interest to compare the applied heat flux with time for low and high
speed drilling. The rate of increasing of the applied heat flux at low drilling speed is
very steep, after that the rate of decreasing of the applied heat flux is also very steep,
finally it decreases slowly until the penetration of the plate. However, the rate of
increasing of the applied heat flux at high drilling speed is not that steep like low
drilling speed and the rate of decreasing of the applied heat flux remains stable. This
may be concluded that the drilling thermal condition for high speed drilling is better
than that for low speed drilling since more stable applied heat flux is experienced.
Finally it can be concluded from the above numerical test cases and
experimental analysis that the SDM is now applied successfully in this 3-D inverse
drilling problem for predicting the time-dependent surface heat fluxes of the drilling
tools.
6. CONCLUSIONS
The SDM with adjoint equation was successfully applied in a 3-D inverse heat
conduction problem in determining the time-dependent applied heat flux of a tool in
