average value and the maximum value of multiple ultra-
sound scans to filter speckles. The results showed that
both methods were effective in reducing speckles. He
also proposed to use local signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs)
to estimate noise levels for ultrasound images. His work
inspired many researchers. In[3], Bamber and Daft de-
veloped an iterative method to reduce speckles for ul-
trasound images. They use local SNR values to control
their speckle reduction process. In each filtering itera-
tion, regions with small SNR values are smoothed while
regions with high SNR values are left intact. In [5], a
directional median (DM) filter method is proposed to re-
duce noise and enhance edges for ultrasound images. In
their method, an 1-D median filtering process is repeat-
edly performed in various directions at each pixel. The
filtering result is set to the maximum response of these
1-D median filtering processes. Loupas et al. developed
an adaptive median filter, the AWMF method, to suppress
speckles[6]. In their method, local SNR values are used
to compute the weights of the pixels inside the median fil-
ter’s mask. Then these pixels are duplicated according to
the computed weights. Finally the new pixel value is set
to the median value of the duplicated pixels.
In some medical imaging modalities, the reflec-
tion intensities are influenced not only by the intrinsic
impedances of tissues but also by the orientations and
shapes of the tissue boundaries. Furthermore, the dis-
tances between the target tissues and the receivers can
also affect the strengths of the responsive signals. Thus
the intensity of the same tissue, located in different po-
sitions, may be different. This phenomenon encourages
scientists to utilize the derivatives of intensity, instead of
the intensity strength, to classify, enhance and construct
tissue structures. In [7], Koller et al. use the 2nd order
Gaussian derivatives to detect line structures in CT im-
ages. By varying the variance of the Gaussian kernel, they
can estimate the thickness of each underlying structure.
Krissian et al. present a novel method for constructing
aorta from abdominal ultrasound data[8]. They combine
the Hessian and structure matrices of the intensity field to
form a descriptor matrix at each pixel. The eigen system
of the descriptor matrix is used to detect the orientation
of aorta. Then, a specialized response function is eval-
uated to find the cross-section boundaries of aorta. By
connecting the cross-section boundaries, the aorta is con-
structed. In another work, Persoon et al. utilize the 1st
order derivatives and the diffusion values of a noisy MRI
data set to create a new and less-noisy volume data set.
Then an improved Canny edge detection method is em-
ployed to extract tissue surfaces to reveal the shapes and
sizes of tissues [9]. In another work[10], Ueng et al. uti-
lize the eigen systems of Hessian matrices to estimate the
local diffusion strengths and directions for all the voxels
of a CT or MRI data set so that the tissue types of the vox-
els can be classified. Then the computed voxel types are
served as criteria to adjust the variance of a Gaussian fil-
ter which is employed to reduce noise and enhance region
boundaries.
3. The diffusion tensor of intensity
The proposed despeckle procedure utilizes the diffu-
sion tensor of the intensity field to identify and classify
structures. The diffusion tensor at a pixel is represented
by using a Hessian matrix. This section presents the defi-
nition and usage of the diffusion tensor for structure detec-
tion and classification. Some related computational tech-
niques are also discussed in this section.
3.1. Diffusion tensor and structure type classification
In the input ultrasound image, the Hessian matrix
H(x, y), evaluated at a pixel I(x, y), is defined by
H =
[
Ixx Ixy
Ixy Iyy
]
=

∂2I
∂x2
∂2I
∂x∂y
∂2I
∂x∂y
∂2I
∂y2
 .
Since H is symmetric, its eigen values are real and its
eigen vectors are mutually orthogonal. Let λ1 and λ2 be
the eigen values with ‖λ1‖ ≥ ‖λ2‖, and ~v1 and ~v2 the corre-
sponding eigen vectors. λ1 and λ2 are the major and minor
eigen values; and ~v1 and ~v2 are the major and minor eigen
vectors.
The eigen values reflect the anisotropy and strength of
the diffusion tensor. They are used to identity the local
structure type. If the magnitudes of the eigen values are
small, the local region is relatively uniform. No feature
is available. If the magnitude of the major eigen value
is much larger than that of the minor eigen value, the in-
tensity varies significantly in the direction of the major
eigen vector but alters slightly in the direction of the mi-
nor eigen vector. The diffusion is anisotropic, and the un-
derlying structure is 1-dimensional. When the magnitudes

4. The structure classification method
As shown in Figure 2, a pixel can be classified as a
part of a uniform, tubular or spot structure based on the
eigen system of the local diffusion tensor. The rules of
this preliminary classification method are summarized in
Table 1. However, there is no objective method to tell
whether an eigen value is large or not. These rules are
logically correct but not practical. In this section, a prac-
tical and efficient classification method is presented for
detecting features and classifying structure types.
4.1. The type classification method
After the eigen systems of the local diffusion tensor
have been computed at all the pixels, the maximum mag-
nitude of the eigen values is searched. The maximum
eigen value magnitude is used to normalize the eigen val-
ues so that their values are within −1 and 1. Then two
variables T1 and T2 are computed by using the normal-
ized eigen values at each pixel by
T1 =
√
λ21 + λ
2
2,
T2 =
‖λ2‖ + 
‖λ1‖ + 
.
T1 is employed to test whether there is a feature in the
local region. In a homogeneous region, the magnitudes
of both the eigen values are small. Thus T1 is nearly 0.
In a tubular structure, the magnitude of the major eigen
value is large but the magnitude of the minor eigen value
is small so that T1 is much larger than 0 and closer to 1.
In a spot, both the eigen value magnitudes are large. T1
can be greater than 1 but less than
√
2. T2 is used to dis-
tinguish a tubular structure from a spot. In a tubular struc-
ture, ‖λ1‖ is much larger than ‖λ2‖, and thus T2 is nearly
0. In a spot, both the eigen value magnitudes are large
and similar so that T2 is approximately 1. In computing
T2, a tiny number  is added to the denominator and the
numerator to avoid divided-by-zero and misjudgement in
case both the eigen values are nearly 0.
Then, by using T1 and T2, we define two response func-
tions to measure the degrees of linearity and spot:
Cl = T1 ∗ (1 − T2),
Cs = T1 ∗ T2.
Cl and Cs are the measurements of linearity and spot re-
spectively. If the local area is not uniform and the ratio of
the minor eigen value magnitude to the major eigen value
magnitude is small, Cl is close to 1 and Cs is close to 0.
On the other hand, if both the eigen value magnitudes are
significant and roughly equal, Cs is closer to or even larger
than 1 and Cl is nearly 0. Now, based on T1, Cl and Cs,
we can detect and classify the local structure.
In the preliminary structure classification rules listed in
Table 1, only three structure types are defined. In order
to retrieve more structure information for the following
despeckling process, we refine the classification model

5. The structure-based despeckle method
All filters have their pros and cons for suppressing
speckles. Some filters can significantly reduce speck-
les, but they blur edges. Other filters preserve edges but
may produce unwanted patterns. In this work, we adopt
a structure-based despeckling strategy. Pixels of different
types are smoothed by using different filters so that speck-
les in uniform regions are reduced and tissue boundaries
and edges are preserved.
5.1. The filtering strategy
We create a filter pool which includes an 1-D Gaussian
filter, a 2-D median filter and a 2-D Gaussian filter. These
filters are adaptively selected to smooth pixels according
to the following principles:
• Linear-typed and boundary-typed pixels are filtered
by using the 1-D Gaussian filter. The standard devia-
tion of the 1-D Gaussian filter is 1. The filter mask is
composed of 9 pixels. Its direction is parallel to the
minor eigen vector of the target pixel.
• Uniform-typed pixels are smoothed by using the 2-D
median filter. The mask of the median filter is com-
posed of 9 × 9 pixels.
• Spot-typed pixels are filtered by using the 2-D Gaus-
sian filter. The standard deviation of this 2-D Gaus-
sian filter is 1.
• Unknown-typed pixels are smoothed by using the 2-
D median filter.
In the classification process, bright and dark curves are
classified as linear and boundary structures. For a pixel re-
siding in a curve, its minor eigen vector~v2 is tangent to the
curve. To filter the pixel, an 1-D stick centered at the pixel
and parallel to ~v2 is created at first. Then the 1-D Gaus-
sian filtering process is carried out at the pixel by using
the stick as the filter mask. After the filtering, the intensity
along the curve becomes more coherent, while the inten-
sity contrast across the curve is increased. Thus the curve
is not only preserved but also enhanced. Sharp corners,
endpoints of edges and isolated bright and dark points are
classified as spot structures. Spot structures are filtered
by using the 2-D Gaussian filter so that small spots are
blended into the surrounding areas, while large spots are
preserved. Pixels residing in uniform areas are smoothed
by using the 2-D median filter. Therefore speckles and
pepper-and-salt noise in uniform areas can be removed.
At unknown-typed pixels, no obvious feature can be de-
tected. The 2-D median filter is used to filter these pixels
so that thin and fuzzy structures are removed, but thick
structures are preserved.
5.2. Iterative filtering process
If the filtered image still contains significant speckles,
the whole despeckling pipeline is repeated until the image
quality satisfies our goal. The number of filtering passes,
required to achieve the satisfied results, is data-dependent.
Three filtering passes may be needed for a highly noisy
image, while one filtering pass is sufficient for a relatively
clean image. For ordinary ultrasound images, a 2-pass
despeckling process is the most cost-effective strategy ac-
cording to our experiments. An example is presented in
Figure 5 to show the effectiveness of using multiple de-
speckling passes. The raw ultrasound image is shown in
the part (a) of Figure 3, and the images produced by the
1st, 2nd and 3rd filtering passes are displayed in Figure 5.
As shown in these images, speckles are removed while
longer and thicker tissue boundaries are enhanced as ad-
ditional despeckling passes have been carried out.
6. Experimental results and comparisons
The proposed speckle reduction method can be viewed
as an extension and combination of median filter and
Gaussian filter. We compare our filtering method with

up about 70% of the total cost, the time complexity of
the proposed method is roughly linear with respect to the
input data size.
7. Conclusion
In this research report, we present a structure-based de-
speckle method for ultrasound data. Our method explores
local structure information by using the diffusion tensor
of intensity. Then, based on the computed structure types,
feasible filters are selected from a filter pool to suppress
speckles and enhance features. Experimental results show
that the proposed method is capable of removing speckles
in homogeneous regions, preserving edges and enhancing
region boundaries for ultrasound images. It is superior to
the Gaussian filter and the median filters. We also con-
duct objective comparisons for the proposed method and
the other filters by using PSNR and SSIM indices. The
experimental results reveal that the proposed filter is also
very effective in removing multiplicative noise for grey
level images. It produces better PSNR and SSIM values
than the other filters. However, due to the page limitation,
these results and analysis are not presented in this report.

在本計畫中我們開發了以下的創新技術： 
1.在本研究計畫中我們設計了一套專門辨識超音波的區域組織的演算法。我們利用擴散張
量場（Diffusive Tensor Field）的強弱來估算肝臟組織的粗糙程度；然後再利用此張量
場特徵值的大小和比例推算出粗糙區域的型態。若為線性組織如血管和邊界，則利用該擴
散張量場的特徵向量找出它的方向性。 
2.根據上面的技術我們研發一套抑制斑點雜訊和強化組織的超音波資料處理方法。在此方
法中，我們利用不同濾波器對不同組織進行後處理；例如我們利用中值濾波器對平滑組織
進行抑制雜訊的工作，以一維高斯濾波器強化血管組織和增進器官邊界和內部區域的對
比。如此一來，不僅抑制了大量的斑點雜訊也強化了肝臟各部的組織特徵。 
3.我們擴大了這兩項技術的應用，將它們用來增強灰階影像和去除乘積型雜訊
（Multiplicative Noise），結果明顯比現有的一些加權型和適應型（Adaptive）中值濾
波器好。我們的方法不僅能提高訊雜比（SNR）也能保留視覺組織（以 SSIM 為基礎）。上
述技術我們已寫成一篇論文，準備投稿國際期刊。 
 
我們打算將這些技術應用於肝腫瘤和肝硬化區塊及其周圍血管組織的自動辨識上，目前我
們與長庚醫院嚴卓立教授合提了一項相關計畫，而且已獲長庚醫院補助，目前已進行了三
