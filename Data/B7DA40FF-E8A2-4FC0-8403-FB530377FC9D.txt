二.ABSTRACT 
A series of novel types of diblock and yriblock amphiphlic biodegradable copolymers 
were synthesized by ring-opening polymerization. These products were characterized 
by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), 1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR and gel 
desorption /ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. With an increase un the 
contents ofε-CL incorporated into the copolymers, a decrease in the glass-transition 
temperature(Tg) was observed. The Tg values of copoly(4-phenyl-ε-carprolactone) 
and copoly(4-methyl -ε-carprolactone) were higher than Tg of copoly(carprolactone). 
Their micellar characteristics in an aqueous phase were investigated with fluorescence 
spectroscopy, dynamics light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy. The 
block copolymers formed micelles in the aqueous phase with critical micelle 
concentrations in the range 1.00-1.36mg L-1.With higher molecular weights and 
hydrophobic components in the copolymers, a higher critical micelle concentration 
was observed. As the feed weight ratio of amtitriptyline hydrochloride (AM) to the 
polymer increased, the drug loading increased. The micelles exhibited a spherical 
shape, and the average size was less than 250nm. The in vitro hydrolytic degradation 
and controlled drug release properties of the triblock copolymers were also 
investigated.

MPEG-b-PMCL and MPEG-b-PBCL diblock copolymers were synthesized by 
ring-opening polymerization of 4-methyl- -caprolactone (MCL) or 4-phenyl-
-caprolactone (BCL) using monomethoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (MPEG, Mn = 550 or 
2000 g mol−1) as the macroinitiator and SnOct2 as the catalyst. These copolymers 
were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), 1H NMR, 13C NMR, 
and gel permeation chromatography. The thermal properties (Tg and Tm) of the diblock 
copolymers depend on the composition of polymers. When larger amount of MCL or 
BCL was incorporated into the macromolecular backbone there was an increase in Tg. 
Their micellar characteristics in the aqueous phase were investigated by fluorescence 
spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and dynamic light scattering 
(DLS). The block copolymers formed micelles in the aqueous phase with critical 
micelle concentrations (CMCs) in the range of 0.5–2.9 mg L−1, depending on the 
composition of polymers. The lengths of hydrophilic segment influence the shape of 
micelle. The mean hydrodynamic diameters of micelles from DLS were in the range 
of 70-140 nm. The drug entrapment efficiency and the drug-loading content of 
micelles depending on the composition of block polymers were described.

Functional poly(carbonate-b-ester)s were synthesized in buck by ring-opening 
polymerization of the carbonate (TMC, MBC, or BMC) with tert-butyl 
N-(2-hydroxyethyl)carbamate as an initiator, and then with ε -CL (orε -BCL) 
comonomer. Subsequently, the PMMC-b-PCL with pendent carboxyl groups and the
