limitations of crystallographic directions for 
crystals, piezoelectric ceramics made of lead 
zirconate titanate (PZT) have been adopted 
for most engineering applications in the past 
few decades.  These piezoceramics have 
the advantages of lower cost, higher 
mechanical strength, better piezoelectric 
activity, and easier shape forming.  
Although the vibration characteristics of 
piezoelectric plates can be analytically 
determined by linear piezoelectricity and 
plate theory; completely exact solutions are 
obtained usually for circular or annular types 
with certain simplifications. 
In general, the theoretical analysis 
for piezoelectric rectangular plates is more 
complicated because there is no exact 
solution to the governing equations.  
Regarding the manipulation for elastic 
rectangular plates, the series-form 
trigonometric or trial functions are usually 
employed to satisfy the electrical or 
mechanical boundary conditions.  
Referring to the literature, the transverse 
vibration characteristics were usually 
investigated for the piezoceramic laminated 
plates or bimorphs; moreover, most of 
articles presented the theoretical or 
numerical analysis and only few 
experimental investigations were provided, 
especially by using the identification of 
resonant frequencies and the corresponding 
mode shapes.  In this paper, the transverse 
vibration of piezoceramic rectangular plates 
with completely free (free-free-free-free, 
FFFF) and completely clamped 
(clamped-clamped-clamped-clamped, 
CCCC) edges are investigated in three 
aspects: theoretical analysis, numerical 
simulation, and experimental measurement.  
The theoretical calculation is carried out by 
Ritz’s method together with the named 
equivalent constant method.  By using the 
proposed methodology, the electrical field 
consideration is suppressed and the 
transverse vibration analysis of 
piezoceramic rectangular plates is 
undertaken once the corresponding 
conditions of isotropic plates are determined.  
To validate the theoretical results, this study 
utilizes two optical techniques, 
amplitude-fluctuation electronic speckle 
pattern interferometry (AF-ESPI) and laser 
Doppler vibrometer (LDV), and the 
impedance analyzer to experimentally 
investigate the vibration behavior of 
piezoceramic rectangular plates in resonance.  
The advantage of using the AF-ESPI method 
is that both resonant frequencies and the 
corresponding mode shapes can be obtained 
simultaneously from the experimental 
procedure.  Besides the AF-ESPI 
measurement, the resonant frequencies 
measured by LDV system and impedance 
analyzer can provide additional information 
about the piezoceramic plate vibration.  
Commercially available finite element 
analysis software is also used to provide the 
numerical simulation of resonant 
frequencies and mode shapes.  Good 
agreements of the resonant frequencies are 
obtained for theoretical, experimental, and 
numerical results; in addition, the mode 
shapes obtained by the AF-ESPI method 
also agree well with the numerical results.  
Based on the theoretical calculations, the 
dependence of transverse resonant 
frequencies on equivalent Poisson’s ratio 
ranging from 0.25 to 0.6 is investigated with 
five different aspect ratios 
( 3 and ,2 ,1 ,2/1 ,3/1 ).  To verify the 
suitability of the proposed theoretical 
analysis, one isotropic aluminum material 
(6061T6) and four piezoceramic materials 
(BaTiO3, PZT-4, PZT-5, and PIC-151) are 
selected to perform the FEM calculations 
and then compare with the theoretical 
predictions.

◆ Experimental investigations and 
theoretical discussions 
The piezoceramic rectangular plates 
with effective size a = b = 40 mm, and 
thickness h = 0.5 mm are selected to 
perform experimental and numerical 
investigations.  The model number of 
piezoceramics is PIC-151 (Germany Physik 
Instrument Company).  Two opposite 
surfaces of the plate ( 2hz ±= ) are 
completely covered by CuNi electrodes and 
the plate is excited by an alternating voltage 
across the two electroded surfaces.  There 
are two types of mechanical boundary 
conditions, FFFF and CCCC, to be 
discussed in this study; as mentioned above, 
the symbols FFFF and CCCC represent 
piezoceramic rectangular plates with 
completely free and completely clamped 
edges, respectively. 
The full-field, time-averaged 
AF-ESPI optical systems are first used to 
perform the transverse (out-of-plane) 
vibration measurements.  The advantage of 
using the AF-ESPI method is that both 
resonant frequencies and the corresponding 
mode shapes can be obtained simultaneously 
from the experimental procedure.  The 
interpretation of the interference fringe 
image is similar to the reading of a contour 
map.  As seen in the experimental results, 
the fringe pattern corresponds to the mode 
shape and the brightest fringes represent the 
nodal lines at resonance.  Figure 1 shows 
the experimental and numerical results for 
the first five mode shapes of the FFFF 
piezoceramic plate and Fig. 2 shows the first 
five mode shapes of the CCCC piezoceramic 
plate.  In Figs. 1 and 2, we indicate the 
phase of displacement for finite element 
results as dark or light lines, with the dark 
lines in the opposite direction to the light 
lines.  The transition from dark lines to 
light lines corresponds to zero displacement 
lines, also called nodal lines.  The 
zero-order fringe, which is the brightest 
fringe in the experimental results, represents 
the nodal lines of the vibrating piezoceramic 
plates at resonance.  The mode index (m, n) 
shown in Figs. 1 and 2 indicates that the 
mode shape contains (m-1) and (n-1) nodal 
lines parallel to the y- and x-axis, 
respectively; however, this excludes the 
nodal lines along the clamped edges.  The 
mode shapes obtained by AF-ESPI 
measurement can be checked by the nodal 
lines and fringe patterns with the numerical 
results.  Excluding some mode shapes that 
are too blurry to be captured by AF-ESPI, 
excellent agreement between experimental 
measurement and numerical simulation is 
found for both FFFF and CCCC 
piezoceramic plates. 
To compare with the results obtained 
by AF-ESPI, the other point-wise optical 
technique called the laser Doppler 
vibrometer (LDV) (AVID, Ahead 
Optoelectronics Inc.) is also employed to 
measure the transverse vibration modes.  
The experimental gain spectrums of FFFF 
and CCCC piezoceramic plates are shown in 
Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, respectively; the peaks 
appearing in the frequency response curve 
stand for the resonant frequencies of 
transverse vibration.  It is indicated that, 
for the CCCC piezoceramic plate shown in 
Fig. 4, there are four “additional“ resonant 
frequencies being measured for which the 
corresponding mode indices could not be 
found.  However, this unexpected situation 
does not occur with the FFFF piezoceramic 
plate, so this phenomenon should result 
from the imperfect simulation of clamped 
edges for the CCCC piezoceramic plate. 
The first 20 transverse resonant 
frequencies of the FFFF piezoceramic plate 
are obtained by theoretical prediction, FEM 
calculation, LDV, and AF-ESPI; and the first 
15 transverse resonant frequencies for the 
CCCC piezoceramic plate are also 
performed.  The FEM calculations of 
resonant frequencies as well as mode shapes 
are investigated by the ABAQUS finite 
element package.  The 20-node 
three-dimensional solid piezoelectric 
element “C3D20RE”, standing for the 
20-node quadratic brick element with 
 6
are not extensional modes but transverse 
modes, because the resonant frequencies of 
which correspond to the modes (2,5) and 
(1,6).  As compared with the case of the 
FFFF piezoceramic plate, it can be seen that 
the transverse modes for the CCCC 
piezoceramic plate, as measured by 
impedance analysis, are induced due to the 
clamped edges.  In other words, inasmuch 
as the imperfect clamped boundary 
simulation, the transverse modes will be 
unexpectedly detected with the impedance 
variation. 
四、計畫成果自評部份 
Concerning the rectangular plates with 
completely free and completely clamped 
boundaries, it is analytically difficult to 
obtain exact solutions for the vibration 
analysis, even for an isotropic material.  
Herein Ritz’s method together with 
equivalent constants provides a more 
convenient strategy to investigate the 
transverse vibration characteristics of 
piezoceramic rectangular plates.  The 
advantages of using this methodology are 
that the electrical field consideration can be 
neglected, and the vibration analysis of 
piezoceramic plates is carried out once the 
corresponding conditions of isotropic plates 
are given.  By means of the numerical 
calculations and two experimental 
measurements (AF-ESPI and LDV) 
employed in this study, consistency between 
these results implies that the theoretical 
prediction has good accuracy and gives the 
upper bounds for most of the transverse 
resonant frequencies.  With the different 
aspect ratios and material types of 
piezoceramic plates, the frequency 
parameter variations are theoretically 
discussed and agree well with the FEM 
calculations.  In addition, it is 
experimentally found that the impedance 
analyzer cannot measure the transverse 
vibration modes of piezoceramic plates; 
however, if the clamped boundary 
simulation is imperfect, the transverse 
vibration modes will be unexpectedly 
measured.
