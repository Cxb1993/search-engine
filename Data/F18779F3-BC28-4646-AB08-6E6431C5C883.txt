Empirical and mathematical study of river behavior  
across the mountain-plain transition 
Year 3 final report 
PI: H. Capart 
 
Abstract 
The three-year research aims to contribute to the qualitative understanding and quantitative 
description of the behavior of rivers across piedmont transitions. As evidenced by the bridge 
failure events due to Typhoon Sinlaku in 2008, and again by the extreme changes associated 
with Typhoon Morakot in 2009, the mountain-plain transition is an area of heightened hazard 
for infrastructure sited near, along, and across river beds. To better understand river behavior 
across this critical zone, the three-year research includes field data acquisition, small-scale 
laboratory experiments, mathematical analysis and numerical modeling efforts. Our field 
monitoring efforts have been focused on the Laonong and Chishan Rivers, and their evolution 
subsequent to Typhoon Morakot. To evaluate hazards due to debris dammed lakes like those 
formed along these two rivers during and after Morakot, we have then developed 
mathematical models of lake formation, lake breaching and downstream flood propagation. 
To verify our model of lake formation and decay, we have applied it to the Putunpunas and 
Namaxia lakes formed along the Laonong and Chishan River. To test our model of lake 
breaching and flood propagation under a wider range of circumstances, we then conducted 
model tests for a variety of documented cases outside Taiwan. The results of these verification 
tests show that our modeling approach can successfully describe the gradual breaching of 
earthen dams, as well as the propagation of the resulting flood down valley and across the 
mountain-plain transition.

2. Summary of work conducted in the third year of the project 
To test and verify our modeling approach, our work for the third year of the project has 
focused on comparison cases outside Taiwan, for which detailed data are available. Prominent 
among these cases is the Tangjiashan landslide dam breaching episode of June 2008, which 
took place in a similar environment upstream of the mountain-plain transition, and for which 
unusually complete data have been collected. Formed due to the Sichuan earthquake, the dam 
released upon breaching a high magnitude flood (Figure 3).

Analytical solutions for gradual dam breaching and downstream flooding 2 
 Hervé Capart 3

Abstract. An analytical model is proposed to describe lake drainage and downstream 6 
flooding due to the gradual breaching of natural and manmade earthen dams. Triangular dams  7 
are considered, free from basal constraints on erosion, and undergoing gradual incision by a 8 
breaching channel of constant effective width. Adopting a simple stream power law for dam 9 
material transport, the long profile evolution of the breaching channel is governed by a 10 
diffusion equation with variable diffusion rate, proportional to the discharge. The resulting 11 
flood is routed downstream using the kinematic wave equation. Moving boundary problems 12 
are obtained due to retrogression of the breach crest, and to the downstream propagation of 13 
the flood wavefront. For both the dam breaching and flood routing problems, explicit 14 
analytical solutions are derived. They depict a breaching process that is at first 15 
self-accelerating, then becomes self-limiting. Results include boundary paths, long profiles, 16 
and stage and discharge hydrographs. In particular, the breaching solution yields a discharge 17 
hydrograph of simple analytical shape that turns out to be ideally suited for kinematic wave 18 
routing. The model is applied to the well-documented breaching of the Tangjiashan landslide 19 
dam, Sichuan, in June 2008. Calculated results for this and other cases are in reasonably good 20 
agreement with the measured data. As the model is simple to apply, with minimal 21 
computational and data requirements, it could prove useful as a tool for rapid risk assessment. 22 
Another advantage over black box numerical models is that the solutions and their 23 
dependence on the problem data are transparent to interpret.  24

but develops over a length scale short enough to consider water discharge to be uniform 51 
(although unsteady) along the length of the breaching channel. Flood routing, by contrast, 52 
aims to capture the development of the flood wave over long distances down valley, and the 53 
resulting flood flow is neither uniform nor steady. On the other hand, one can assume that this 54 
flow occurs in a valley of fixed geometry. Exceptions occur when floods reach such 55 
magnitude that they become valley-forming floods. A well-documented example is the Ha! 56 
Ha! Lake breakout flood of 1996, which caused channel avulsion and extreme valley 57 
widening far downstream of the dam breach [Lapointe et al., 1998; Brooks and Lawrence, 58 
1999; Capart et al., 2007b]. Few cases, however, feature such extreme geomorphic changes, 59 
and the assumption that the downstream valley is rigid typically constitutes a good first 60 
approximation. The breaching and routing problems can therefore be addressed in turn. 61 
 62 
Floods produced by breaching can reach peak discharges well in excess of the rate of water 63 
inflow into the lake. They tend however to develop more gradually than floods produced by 64 
instantaneous dam removal. They also typically do not lead to the complete drainage of the 65 
impounded lake, even in the absence of non-erodible controls constraining breach incision at 66 
the base of the dam. During incision, the breaching channel simultaneously increases in depth, 67 
width, and length. The required transport of dam material by flowing water then limits the 68 
pace and ultimate depth of incision. Among other factors, the lakeward migration of the 69 
breach crest along the upstream face of the dam can contribute significantly to lengthening the 70 
breaching channel and pacing the breaching process. A difficulty associated with these 71 
mechanisms is that neither the pace, width, or ultimate depth of incision, nor the 72 
corresponding outflow hydrograph, are known in advance. They are instead outcomes of the 73 
breaching process, which must be related to the geometrical and material properties of the 74 
dam and to the storage characteristics of the lake.  75 
 76

but its longitudinal profile ),( txz  is free to evolve in space and time. Adopting a simple 102 
stream power law for dam material transport, the long profile evolution of the breaching 103 
channel is governed by a diffusion equation with variable diffusion rate, proportional to the 104 
breaching discharge. The upstream crest of the breaching channel is allowed to migrate along 105 
the upstream dam face, making this a moving boundary problem. The above assumptions are 106 
more restrictive than those of the BREACH model, for instance [Fread, 1988; 1998], 107 
particularly as concerns breach width. However, they lead to a model that can be completely 108 
solved analytically. Results include explicit solutions of simple form for the time evolution of 109 
the lake level )(tzL , breach crest level )(tzC , and breaching outflow hydrograph )(tQB .  110 
 111 
Turning to the routing problem, the kinematic wave approximation is adopted to calculate 112 
flood propagation down valley [Lighthill and Whitham, 1955; Whitham, 1974; Hunt, 1984a,b]. 113 
Long flood waves are assumed, for which flow is globally unsteady and non-uniform, but 114 
approximated as locally uniform. This assumption is appropriate over shorter length scales for 115 
steep upland rivers, but remains applicable to rivers of milder slope provided that effective 116 
flood behavior over long distances is sought. To route the discharge ),( txQ , a wide valley of 117 
constant effective slope VS  and width Vb  is assumed. Flood stage at a station, however, can 118 
be estimated from this discharge based on local valley characteristics. As illustrated in Figure 119 
3, the idealization proposed by Hunt [1984a] is adopted to formulate upstream boundary 120 
conditions. Although the breaching channel has a different width and slope than the 121 
downstream valley, it is assumed to be sufficiently short to convey the breaching hydrograph 122 
without delay, distortion or attenuation. The breaching hydrograph )(tQB  applied at the 123 
origin 0x  can therefore be taken as upstream boundary condition.  124 
 125 
It turns out that the hydrograph of special form obtained as solution to the breaching problem 126

2. Governing equations and simplifying assumptions 153 
Lake drainage is assumed governed by the level-pool routing equation [e.g. Henderson, 1966] 154 
 BULL QQdt
dzA  , (1) 155 
where )(tzL  is the evolving lake water level, LA  the surface area of the lake, UQ  the 156 
upstream discharge into the lake, and )(tQB  the time-varying outflow discharge through the 157 
breach. For simplicity, we assume that LA  is approximately constant during breaching 158 
[Wetmore and Fread, 1981]. Focusing on cases where the breaching outflow dominates, we 159 
further neglect inflow and assume 0UQ . Assuming outflow through a rectangular 160 
breaching channel of width Bb  and crest level )(tzC , the outflow discharge through the 161 
breach is assumed governed by the broad-crested weir equation [Henderson, 1966] 162 
 2/32/1278 ))()(()( tztzgbtQ CLBB  . (2) 163 
Although in practice the breach width is expected to evolve as incision proceeds [Fread, 1988; 164 
Coleman et al., 2002], we assume for simplicity a constant effective width Bb  during the 165 
process. We will further assume that breaching starts (defining time t = 0) when the lake level 166 
Lz  barely exceeds the initial dam crest level DC zz )0( . 167 
 168 
Before incision, the dam is assumed triangular in shape, with upstream and downstream faces 169 
of inclinations DR  and DS , respectively, and initial dam elevation Dz . Incision is assumed 170 
unconstrained by the presence of any non-erodible substrate at the base of the dam. The time 171 
and space-varying bottom elevation ),( txz  of the breaching channel is assumed governed by 172 
the Exner equation for sediment mass balance [see e.g. Paola and Voller, 2005] 173

the discharge hydrograph, the downstream valley is assumed to have constant effective width 213 
Vb  and bottom slope VS . To calculate the resulting stage at a given cross-section, however, 214 
one can use the local slope and width, or a local rating curve. Substituting equation (10) into 215 
equation (9) yields the kinematic wave equation [Lighthill and Whitham, 1955; Hunt, 1984a] 216

where subscripts + and  denote states upstream and downstream of a shock traveling at 221

wave, and it is assumed for simplicity that the river ahead of the shock is at comparatively 223 
low stage ( 0  hQ ). The shock condition therefore reduces to  224 
 11
Typically, such a transformation is used to deal with a time-varying diffusion coefficient of 249 
know time dependence [Crank, 1975]. Here it allows solving for the evolving long profile 250 
),( xz  of the outflow channel without yet knowing how the breaching discharge )(tQB  251 
varies in time. For the case of a triangular dam, the solution of the steady rate diffusion 252 
equation with moving upstream boundary was derived earlier in Capart et al. [2007a]. The 253 
solution for the evolving long profile takes the similarity form 254 
 )/(),(  xFzxz D  ,   )(Cxx  , (18) 255 
where the evolving dam crest acting as upstream boundary migrates lakeward according to 256

Other solutions with the same similarity structure have been derived by Voller et al. [2004], 258 
Lai and Capart [2007, 2009], Hsu and Capart [2008], and Lorenzo-Trueba et al. [2009]. 259 
Function F  and parameter   must be found by substituting (18) and (19) into diffusion 260 
equation (17) and boundary conditions (6), (7) and (8). The solution which satisfies the 261 
diffusion equation and downstream boundary condition (6) (and by implication the initial dam 262 
profile) is 263

And where )(erfc   is the complementary error function. A detailed derivation of this 267

coefficients C  and   using the two upstream boundary conditions (7) and (8). Condition 269

when the upstream dam face is sloping instead of vertical. Because it requires erosion of more 294 
dam material, lakeward migration of the outflow channel crest slows the pace of incision.  295 
 296 
Regardless of how dam faces are inclined, the obtained solutions exhibit a remarkable 297 
property which facilitates the ensuing solution of the coupled problem. Let 298

This relative level starts from zero, experiences a maximum at time to peak 359 
 17
The exponents obtained for the power law formula (55) show that the peak breaching 380 
discharge is sensitive to the transport coefficient and lake surface area (exponent 3/2 for K and 381 
LA ), and very sensitive to the upstream and downstream inclinations of the dam faces 382 
(exponent 3 for DS  and  ). In agreement with intuition, a dam with steep upstream and 383 
downstream faces and a large impounded lake area is most at risk of releasing a catastrophic 384 
flood. By contrast, the discharge is not so sensitive to the width of the breaching channel 385 
(exponent 1/2 for Bb ), partly justifying the approximation of effectively constant width 386 
during breaching. As a check of consistency, we can verify that 387 
 PPBBLB TQdttQdAV 2)(0   . (58) 388 
The water volume lost from the lake is equal to the time integral of the outflow discharge past 389 
the breach.  390 
 391 
The analytical solutions to the breaching problem are illustrated in Figure 6. Figure 6a shows 392 
how the lake water level and breach crest elevation evolve in time. A monotonous decrease of 393 
sigmoidal shape is obtained for both variables, with the lake level drawdown lagging behind 394 
the crest elevation drop. Initially, the breaching process is self-accelerating: a drop in crest 395 
level increases the available head, which increases the discharge and further accelerates crest 396 
incision. Eventually, however, the process becomes self-limiting as incision and drawdown 397 
approach the asymptote BD dzz  , where Bd  is given by equation (57). This occurs 398 
without needing to enforce any external constraint on erosion at the base of the dam. Instead, 399 
lengthening of the breaching channel causes any further incision to require more water flow 400 
past the crest than lake drawdown can provide. In between, the head difference between lake 401 
level and crest elevation attains its maximum at time PTt   given by equation (56). The 402 
breach crest at that point has reached half its ultimate drop, and the lake water level one 403 
quarter of its ultimate drawdown Bd . 404

For 1t , this formula approaches the asymptotic result 3/223 )2()( ttxF   obtained by Hunt 492 
[1984b] for the instantaneous release of a finite volume of water. It can also be checked that 493 
the resulting front velocity does indeed satisfy shock condition (65), which was implicitly 494 
 23
and downstream of the propagating wave front. Since low stage conditions are assumed for 520 
the river prior to dam breaching, characteristics downstream of the front are vertical. 521 
Upstream of the front, by contrast, characteristics of variable inclinations originate from the 522 
upstream boundary 0ˆ x . Faster and slower characteristics are obtained depending on when 523 
they originate with respect to the evolving breach hydrograph. The fastest characteristic 524 
(inclined closest to horizontal in the )ˆ,ˆ( tx  plane) is associated with the peak discharge and 525 
starts out at dimensionless time tˆ 1. The wavefront path forms the locus where upstream 526 
and downstream characteristics intersect. This wavefront accelerates at first, then decelerates, 527 
yielding a sigmoidal path in the )ˆ,ˆ( tx  plane. The inflection point occurs where the 528 
characteristic ray carrying the flood peak catches up with the wavefront, at the precise 529

Figure 9b, finally, shows how the peak and front amplitude vary with distance travelled down 532 
valley. The maximum discharge experienced during the flood is the same for all stations 533 
located so close to the dam that the wave peak has not yet caught up with the wavefront. At 534 
the wavefront, the discharge grows at first, then decays according to 535

upper reaches of the Tongkou river, where the valley cuts through the Longmen Mountains, as 567 
well as lower reaches of the river in Sichuan Basin (Figure 10a). The timely excavation of the 568 
dam crest and evacuation of downstream areas successfully mitigated the impact of the flood. 569 
In addition, substantial efforts were deployed to record the breaching and flooding process. 570 
Presented in detail in two papers by Liu et al. [2009, 2010], the data collected include video 571 
observations and measurements of breach width, stage, flow depth, velocity and discharge 572 
through the breach. The geometry and material composition of the landslide dam were also 573 
documented. Moreover, flood hydrographs were measured at three cross-sections located 5.3, 574 
27.3, and 74.9 km downstream of the dam (Figure 10c).  575 
 576 
5.2. Dam breaching calculation 577 
To apply the breaching model to this event, the longitudinal dam profile must first be 578 
approximated by a triangular shape. Due to the excavation, the long profile before the breach 579 
was trapezoidal instead of triangular, and some judgment must be applied to obtain an 580 
equivalent triangular profile. For this purpose, it is assumed that catastrophic breaching 581 
occurred only after retrogressive erosion caused the downstream slope break of the trapeze to 582 
migrate lakeward until reaching the upstream slope break, redistributing dam material in the 583 
process. Using an equal areas rule, the resulting dam slope is lower than the original slope of 584 
the downstream face of the trapezoidal dam (Figure 11a). The triangular dam obtained from 585 
this approximation has upstream and downstream slopes of inclination DR 0.04 and 586 
DS 0.09, respectively. Using eq. (28), the corresponding slope ratio  DD RS 2.25 587 
yields root  0.4533 for the crest migration coefficient (Figure 4a). The lake surface area 588 
during breaching is estimated from a linear fit through the measured lake storage curve 589 
between elevations 730 m and 740 m (Figure 11b), yielding value LA  6.4  106 m2. 590 
Measurements of the evolving breach width (Figure 11c) show that the breach widened 591 
rapidly at first, before stabilizing to a width of 145 m, possibly due to lateral bedrock control 592

Alternatively, a distance-weighted average could also be used [Wetmore and Fread, 1981]. At 621 
each station, furthermore, rating curves of the form  622 
 3/2Qch k  (86) 623 
are fitted to the available stage-discharge data [Liu et al., 2009]. In the kinematic wave 624 
approximation, the corresponding wave speed at each station is given by the Kleitz-Seddon 625 
formula [Whitham, 1974] 626

Finally, based on eq. (10), an effective friction coefficient for the valley is calculated as 631

Table 2 lists the parameter values at each cross-section, estimated from Liu et al. [2009], as 633 
well as the composite values for the valley obtained by the above formulas.  634 
 635 
Results for the flood routing problem are presented in Figures 13 and 14. Figure 13a shows 636 
the predicted and measured discharge hydrographs at the three gauging stations. Calculations 637 
of the transition distance Tx  using formula (83) yields the result Tx 111 km. Since all 638 
three stations are located upstream of this point (the Mianyang station, at location 3x 74.9 639 
km, is close to the limit), the theory predicts that no peak attenuation should yet occur. This is 640 
consistent with the measurements, which indicate peak discharges of 6540, 6210, and 6100 641 
 29
performed using the SOBEK software, yield peak arrival times in better agreement with the 667 
observations. However they predict more peak attenuation than recorded (peak reduced to 668 
5800 m3/s instead of the observed 6100 m3/s at Mianyang station), suggesting that the results 669 
may be affected by some degree of numerical diffusion. Although they are not affected by 670 
numerical diffusion, the present solutions are subject to the limitations of the kinematic wave 671 
approximation. For rapid risk assessment, they nevertheless provide a good first 672 
approximation of flood behavior. Perhaps the most important practical implication for gradual 673 
breaching floods in confined valleys is that no flood peak attenuation should be hoped for 674 
until very long distances downstream of the dam (more than 100 km in this case).  675 
 676 
6. Further comparisons with measured data 677 
6.1. Lake Ha! Ha! breakout flood 678 
A second case for which detailed information at the breach is available is the 1996 Ha! Ha! 679 
Lake breakout flood [Lapointe et al., 1998; Brooks and Lawrence, 1999; Capart et al., 2007a]. 680 
The breach originated when the lake level upstream of a concrete dam overtopped a small 681 
saddle dyke elsewhere along the lake perimeter. The breach incised the earthen dyke itself, 682 
then went on to incise a further 10 m into the loose underlying substrate. In the process, the 683 
breach crest retreated lakeward by approximately 500 m (Figure 15a). Lake drainage 684 
contributed 850 m3/s to the peak discharge, for a total peak outflow of 1010 m3/s when 685 
combined with inflow into the lake. Data collected for this case include an extensive 686 
photographic record, measurements by air photogrammetry of the valley topography before 687 
and after the event, and reconstructed stage and discharge hydrographs. These data were made 688 
available as an electronic supplement to the paper by Capart et al. [2007a].  689 
 690 
For this event, upstream and downstream dam slopes DR 0.018 and DS 0.025 can be 691 
estimated from the pre-flood long profile at the breach site (Figure 15a), yielding values 692 
 31
 719 
6.2. Other field events and controlled experiments 720 
A number of additional field events have been reported for which comparisons are possible. 721 
The set of events considered here is more limited than the sets reported by Costa [1988], 722 
Walder and O’Connor [1997], and Peng and Zhang [2012], because comparisons with the 723 
present model require multiple parameters to be known. Table 3 lists the ten events identified 724 
as sufficiently well-documented. For six of these, discharge hydrographs at the breach or 725 
sufficiently close downstream have been recorded. In addition to the Tangjiashan and Ha! Ha! 726 
cases, hydrographs were recorded for the 1974 Mayunmarca landslide dam breach, Montaro 727 
River, Peru [Lee and Duncan, 1975], and for three lahar dam breaches from Mapanuepe Lake, 728 
the Philippines, following the 1991 Pinatubo volcano eruption [Umbal and Rodolfo, 1996]. 729 
Parameter values and sources for the ten cases are listed in Table 3. Controlled experiments 730 
with small earthen dams (Table 4) further expand the scope of comparison. The experiments 731 
with models of the Chaishitan dam were performed as part of a Chinese-Finnish cooperative 732 
research work [Pan and Loukola, 1993], while the experiments with non-cohesive 733 
embankments were conducted as part of the European cooperative research project IMPACT 734 
[Morris et al., 2007]. For those cases in which independent estimates are available for the lake 735 
surface area and for the water volume released by the breach, it can be verified from Tables 3 736 
and 4 that the approximation BLB dAV   is not unreasonable.  737 
 738 
For comparisons with this broader dataset, it is convenient to make relations independent of 739 
the transport coefficient K and dam face inclinations, by eliminating product DSK 2/1  740 
between equations (55), (56) and (57). This yields the following equations for the time to peak 741 
and ultimate breach drop as functions of peak discharge PQ , lake surface area LA , and 742 
breach width Bb : 743

incision to proceed gradually until breaching has run its course. An alternative limiting case 767 
occurs when breach incision reaches its basal control so rapidly that the lake level has not yet 768 
decreased. In this case of sudden breaching, the peak discharge can be approximated by 769 
[Wetmore and Fread, 1981] 770 
 2/332
2/1 )( HbgQ BP   , (94) 771 
where H is the initial height of the dam crest above the dam base, equal to the expected 772 
ultimate breach drop Bd  when basal control is exerted. For the gradual breaching case 773 
considered in the present work, by contrast, the relation of peak discharge to ultimate breach 774 
drop is predicted to be  775 
 2/361
2/1 )( BBP dbgQ  ,  (95) 776 
as obtained by rearranging equation (92). Both equations (94) and (95) derive from the 777 
broad-crested weir equation (2). They differ because the peak available head P  coincides 778 
with the dam height above base H in the sudden breach case, yet reaches only one quarter of 779 
the ultimate breach drop ( BP d41 ) in the gradual breach case (see Figure 6a). The reduction 780 
occurs for the case of gradual breach because peak discharge is attained when incision has 781 
reached only half of the ultimate breach drop, and because by that time the lake level has 782 
already decreased by a quarter. 783 
 784 
Expressed in terms of breach drop Bd , therefore, the peak discharge per unit breach width 785 
BPP bQq /  can be expected to lie between the two bounds 786 
 2/332
2/1 )( BP dgq  , (96) 787 
and  2/361

associated respectively with sudden and gradual breaching. The upper limit corresponds to an 789 
effectively instantaneous dam breach, constrained at the base, while the lower limit 790 
 35
 817 
When the gradual breaching scenario does apply, the resulting floods attain lower discharges 818 
than those produced by instantaneous dam breaches of equivalent drop. The breaching process 819 
takes time to self-accelerate, before exhausting itself as the outflow channel lengthens and the 820 
lake level drops. The evolving lake level and breach crest elevation follow sigmoidal time 821 
histories, tending to a finite asymptotic drop at which breaching stops before the lake has fully 822 
drained. The corresponding discharge hydrograph takes a finite time to reach its peak, before 823 
asymptotically waning to zero. Down valley, the flood wave is transmitted with some delay 824 
and distortion, but attenuation of the flood peak does not occur until some distance 825 
downstream.  826 
 827 
For all these features, it turns out that solutions can be derived analytically. Although the 828 
solution process is mathematically involved, the results of the analysis are surprisingly simple. 829 
They include power laws for the peak breaching discharge, time to peak, ultimate breach drop, 830 
and transition distance beyond which flood peak attenuation occurs. Simple shape functions 831 
are also obtained for the stage and discharge hydrographs. The solutions compare well with 832 
measured data for the Tangjiashan and Ha! Ha! breaching events. Upon calibrating a single 833 
parameter (the transport coefficient K), the predicted evolutions of the lake level, crest 834 
elevation, and breaching discharge are in reasonably good agreement with measured 835 
hydrographs at the breach. Applied to the Tangjiashan event, the model also approximates 836 
well the downstream flood propagation. For the case of gradual breaching, at least, the 837 
solutions provide a simple and transparent tool that will hopefully be useful for practical risk 838 
assessment.  839
