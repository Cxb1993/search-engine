三、結果與討論 
1. 奈米粒子 
由 SEM與 AFM可分析 PBCA和
MMA-SPM奈米粒子的影像。圖 1和圖 2顯示
SEM的結果，圖 1和圖 2分別呈現粒徑為 90 
nm的 PBCA和 40 nm的MMA-SPM。如圖 3
所示，由 AFM量測的 PBCA粒徑為 180 nm，
而圖 4顯示由AFM量測的MMA-SPM粒徑為
70 nm。這些粒子外觀呈圓形且粒徑均一。 
 
2. 抗 HIV藥物於奈米粒子上的負載率 
圖5和圖6的趨勢與藥物的分子量相關，
D4T、DLV和SQV的分子量分別為224.2、516.0 
和670.7 [5]，分子量較小的藥物於奈米粒子上
的負載能力較好，即，在相同粒徑的載體表
面，分子量較小的藥物可較易被負載。而
D4T、DLV和SQV的log Doct (Doct為親疏水值)
分別是-0.72、1.81和4.51 [1]，代表D4T是皋親
水性藥物，而圖5和圖6顯示D4T在兩種奈米粒
子之負載率都高於DLV和SQV，導致這結果的
原因解釋如下。葡聚醣70000扮演穩定劑的角
色，吸附於PBCA奈米粒子的外層，使得PBCA
粒子表面表現出親水性，造成親水性藥物的物
理吸附，在者，帶負電的MMA-SPM奈米粒子
對親水性藥物有較大的親合力[3]，因此，親水
性的藥物容易被負載在PBCA和MMA-SPM奈
米粒子上。此外，D4T在MMA-SPM奈米粒子
上的負載率高於PBCA奈米粒子上的負載率，
而DLV和SQV在MMA-SPM奈米粒子負載率
低於PBCA奈米粒子，這是因為SQV的pKa = 
7.01，在DPBS環境下藥物為電中性，因此SQV
在表面帶正電之PBCA奈米粒比MMA-SPM奈
米粒子負載率高。

Abstract 
The electrophoretic mobility and the zeta potential of bovine knee chondrocytes 
(BKCs), methylmethacrylate-sulfopropylmethacrylate (MMA-SPM) nanoparticles (NPs), 
polybutylcyanoacrylate (PBCA) NPs, and solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) were 
investigated under the influences of Na+, K+, and Ca2+ with various ionic strengths.  The 
fixed charge density in the surface layers of the four biocolloidal particles was estimated 
from the experimental mobility of capillary electrophoresis with a theory of soft charged 
colloids.  The results revealed that, for a specific cationic species, the absolute values of 
the electrophoretic mobility, the zeta potential, and the fixed charge density decreased 
with an increase in ionic strength.  For a constant ionic strength, effect of ionic species 
on the reduction in the absolute values of the electrophoretic mobility, the zeta potential, 
and the fixed charge density followed the order: Na+ > K+ > Ca2+ for the negatively 
charged BKCs, MMA-SPM NPs, and SLNs.  The reverse order is true for the positively 
charged PBCA NPs.

polystyrene NPs leaded to a decrease in the absolute value of the 
electrophoretic mobility, and high applied voltage and appropriate pH value 
were concluded to be favorable to the NP separation.5,6  Furthermore, 
desorption of physically adsorbed orosomucoid from biocompatible 
polyisobutylcyanoacrylate were determined by CE.7  The electrophoretic 
mobility and the zeta potential of colloidal latexes could be modified by 
incorporating human serum albumin or immunoglobulin-G on the polymer 
surfaces.8  For solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), reduction in the absolute 
value of the zeta potential of was observed by the treatment of light and heat, 
rendering an increase in the particulate diameter.9  Moreover, the surface 
charge properties would greatly influence the NP preservations,10 the 
NPs-animal cells interactions,11 and the subsequent applications such as drug 
loading and entrapment.   
In the early electrophoretic theories, Smoluchowski developed a model 
for rigid spherical colloids.  The Smoluchowski’s formula, first revealing the 
relationship between the electrophoretic mobility, µ, and the zeta potential, ζ, 
is shown below.12

where εr, ε0, and η are, respectively, the relative permittivity, the permittivity 
of a vacuum, and the viscosity of surrounding fluid.  Note that eq 1 is valid 
for the case of a >> 1/κ, where a, and κ are, respectively, the particle radius, 
 10
surface softness, which could be a directory parameter for particulate mutual 
interactions.  Finally, the limit electrophoretic mobility and the limit fixed 
charge density of the four biocolloids was calculated.   
 
2. Experimental and Theoretical Section 
Preparation of BKCs.  Isolation, counting, viability assessment, identification, 
cryopreservation, and cultivation of BKCs from calves were reported previously.16  
Concisely, the separation of BKCs from bovine knee cartilage combines the following 
procedures: (i) mechanical disaggregation, (ii) centrifugation, and (iii) enzymatic 
segmentation, where basement membranes in finely chopped tissue were dissected by 
18% type II collagenase (Sigma) for the exposure of BKCs.  1.6 × 105 BKCs in 4 ml of 
Dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (Sigma) were centrifuged at 420 × g and washed by 
tris hydroyxmethyl aminomethane (tris buffer, RDH, 99.5%).  BKCs were centrifuged 
again and resuspended in 4 ml of tris buffer with a specific ionic species and ionic 
strength, i.e., BKC density in the cellular suspension is about 4 × 104 cells/ml.   
Preparation of MMA-SPM, PBCA and SLNs.  Fabrication of MMA-SPM NPs 
and PBCA NPs were described in our previous study.10  Briefly, copolymerization of 
4.5% methyl methacrylate (Fluka) and 0.5% sulfopropyl methacrylate (Aldrich) were 
initiated by 0.03% ammonim persulfate (Sigma).  PBCA NPs were synthesized in the 
presence of 1% butylcyanoacrylate (Sicomet) in an acidic medium containing 1% dextran 
70000 (Fluka).  Polysorbate 80 (FisherScientific) was coated on the external surfaces of 
NPs.  The MMA-SPM and PBCA NPs were fairly monodisperse with the cumulant 
Z-average diameter of 68.4 nm and 129.9 nm, respectively.

2, µ could be evaluated by t exhibited in this figure.  µ and the corresponding ζ were 
listed in Table 1.  As revealed in this table, the larger |ζ|, the higher |µ|.  For the four 
examined biocolloids, magnitude of |µ| and |ζ| followed the order: BKCs < PBCA NPs < 
SLNs < MMA-SPM NPs.  Charged groups of articular chondrocytes were COO
-
 and 
SO3
-
 on chondroitin sulfate (CS) and SO3
-
 on keratin sulfate (KS),19 where CS and KS 
comprised proteoglycans (PGs) on the cellular surface20 and the amount of CS was larger 
than that of KS.21  In addition, types of PGs in cartilage of the patients with 
osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis were more than those in normal articular tissue.  In 
pathologically changed chondrocytes, structurally destroyed CS and KS caused a reduced 
charge density and a decreased cationic absorption, rendering a lower ability to form PG 
aggregates on the cellular surfaces.22  Surface charge group on MMA-SPM NPs was 
SO3
-
 of SPM.23  The reason for positively charged PBCA NPs was the adsorption of H+ 
on CN groups of butylcyanoacrylate monomer from the acidic medium when emulsion 
polymerization take placed.24  For SLNs, the external lipid bilayer containing 
phosphatidylcholine was about 5-6 nm,25,26 and the charged group on SLNs was SO3
-
 of 
taurocholate, which distributed over the outer bilayer surface.27   
Figures 2 (a)-(c) showed, respectively, the zeta potential, the electrophoretic 
mobility, and the fixed charge density of BKCs for various ionic species and ionic 
strengths.  Here, 1/λ = 3.0 nm was the best fitted parameter for BKCs.  1/λ was about 
2.5-3.0 nm for human erythrocytes and human umbilical vein endothelial cells.2,17  As 
exhibited in Fig. 2 (b), the theoretical curves connecting CE data were calculated by the 
soft particle model.  As revealed in Figs. 2 (a)-(c), |ζ|, |µ|, and |N| decreased as I 
increased for a fixed ionic species.  For a constant I, the low-to-high sequence of |ζ|, |µ|, 
 16
order of magnitude of the reduction in |ζ| and |µ| by the counterionic additions followed 
Na
+
 > K
+
 > Ca
2+
 for a constant I.  Fig. 3 (b) also showed the results of µS converted 
from ζ.  As displayed in this figure, µS(I) was qualitatively consistent with µ(I).  The 
average D value was about 25%, suggesting that the Smoluchowski’s formula was not 
appropriate for the application to MMA-SPM NPs.  The apparent disagreement arose 
mainly from the low potential assumption made in the Smoluchowski’s theory.  The 
evaluated µ∞ and N∞ of MMA-SPM NPs were -1.3×10-2 M and -5.89×10-9 m2s-1V-1, 
respectively.  That a larger |N| would cause higher |ζ| and |µ| can also be concluded from 
Figs. 3 (a)-(c).   
Figures 4 (a)-(c) presented, respectively, the variations in ζ, µ, and N of PBCA NPs 
as a function of I.  The best fitted 1/λ was 1.9 nm for PBCA NPs.  As exhibited in these 
figures, ζ, µ, and N reduced as I increased for a fixed cationic species.  Since PBCA 
NPs were positively charged with the potential determining ions H
+
, the governing 
indifferent counterions were Cl
-
.  The influence on the reduction in ζ, µ, and N by the 
addition of Ca
2+
 was greater than that of Na
+
 and K
+
 because the molarity of Cl
-
 in CaCl2 
solution was larger than that in NaCl or KCl solution for a constant I.  Furthermore, for 
a constant I, ζ, µ, and N of K+ was lower than those of Na+.  This was because the ionic 
radius of K
+
 was larger than that of Na
+
, rendering a lower exclusive volume and a more 
approachable behavior of Na
+
 near PBCA NP surfaces, and a higher electrostatic 
potential of the positively charged particles for Na
+
-relating system.29,30  Hence, for a 
fixed I, the order of importance of added cationic species to the influence on the decrease 
in the surface charge properties was Ca
2+
 > K
+
 > Na
+
, as compared with the data of 
 18
electrolytes.  Although SO3
-
 on MMA-SPM NPs was very responsive to cations, 
electroneutralization effect was still incomplete at high electrolyte concentration.  Also, 
the magnitude of |µ∞| became commensurate for PBCA NPs, SLNs, and BKCs.  
Comparing with |N∞| and |µ∞| of the three artificial biocolloids, |µ∞| of BKCs was 
noticeably high because BKCs possessed a relatively large surface softness.  Surface 
charge properties of mammalian cells would also affect a wide range of their applications 
including cellular adhesion31 and aggregation.32  When rat basophilic leukemia cells 
attached to solid surfaces, N and 1/λ would vary from -0.016 M to -0.025 M and from 2.0 
nm to 2.3 nm, respectively.33  Moreover, N could be altered by biochemical reactions on 
the external membrane layer or by metabolisms in the internal cellular cytoplasm.1  
Articular chondrocytes required to maintain a low Na
+
/K
+
 ratio via the regulation of the 
Na
+
, K
+
-ATPase.  An addition of extracellular Na
+
 could induce a higher activity of the 
Na
+
, K
+
-ATPase, rendering ionic transport and N variation in articular chondrocytes.34,35  
Besides, colloidal polymeric particles with a large |N| would highly disperse in a 
suspension; on the contrary, a small |N| and a small 1/λ would cause the particulate 
aggregation.36  In vaccine delivery system, N could be modified by incorporating 
charged polyaminoacids or proteins with NP carriers, yielding an enhanced interaction 
between carriers and human dendritic cells.37,38   
 
4. Conclusions 
In summary, the surface charge properties of BKCs, MMA-SPM NPs, PBCA NPs, 
and SLNs were studied for the three most physiologically encountered cations, Na+, K+,

1. Introduction 
In both natural phenomena and industrial processes, coagulation in a colloidal 
suspension is one of the representative behaviors resulted from particulate interactions.  
Typical problems related to colloidal coagulation include stability of suspended foods 
and polymer latices, invariability of fabrication method such as chemical mechanical 
polish, flocculation in waste water and effluent treatment, and assembly of bacterial, 
plant and animal cells.  In beer brewing process, yeast, a kind of fungi commonly 
applied to food manufacturing, coagulates during fermentation [1] because of the 
influences of cellular hydrophobicity, interfacial structure, electrostatic potential and 
yeast-surface lectin [2].  Besides, coagulation behavior can also be derived from 
addition of coagulant, such as adding of chitosan into a suspension of Escherichia coli [3] 
or colloidal lattices [4].  The rationale behind chitosan-induced coagulation is that the 
dissolution of chitosan in a suspension produces positively charged poly-ions, which can 
be absorbed by the negatively charged colloids, and, hence, the repulsive force among 
particles is reduced via regulation of the electrostatic potential on colloidal surfaces [5].  
In addition, bacteria normally secrete exocellular polymer substances including slimy 
matrix, glycocalyx and surface protein, which eventually form a layer of biomembrane 
and raise the possibility of coagulation [6].  After cellular aggregation and colonial 
formation in human tissue, Staphylococcus aureus may lead to lethal pneumonia, 
meningitis, spondylitis and endocarditis [7].  Similar to the role of potential barrier in 
the deposition of bacterial cells D21g onto quartz surface [8], the major factors 
predominating over colloidal coagulation is the interaction force and energy, whose 
characteristics define the critical coagulation concentration (CCC), an important index 
 44
coagulation, it was concluded that a higher pH value, a smaller valence and a larger 
effective volume of counterions lead to a higher CCC [18].  Based on MVMGCT, 
adsorption of a curvilinear biocolloid onto a charged surface [19] and stability ratio of a 
suspension of nonuniformly charged biocolloids [20] were also investigated.  For the 
case of charged membranes with the capability of absorbing or chelating ionic species in 
an electrolyte solution, the primitive MVMGCT becomes invalid in explicating the 
performance of a biocolloidal suspension.  In practice, ionic absorption or chelation in 
membrane phase arises mainly from the affinity of mobile electrolyte ions to lone-pair 
electrons in the outmost layer of nitrogen, oxygen and/or sulfur atoms of a functional 
group [21].  Vitamin B12, for instance, is a representative of cobalt-chelated material 
[22].  Hence, for realistically examining the electrostatic behavior of biocolloids, 
absorption of cations, which penetrate from the electrolyte solution, by functional groups, 
which are fixed in the biocolloidal membrane phase, requires further consideration [23].  
It can be expected that the characteristics of cation-absorptive reaction occurred in 
particulate membrane layer may play an important role in the rate of biocolloidal 
flocculation.  Recently, various regions of dielectric constant near solid interface were 
included in MVMGCT to estimate biocolloidal deposition [24] and electrophoresis [25].  
In the present stage, it seems to be inevitable to consider the effect of cationic absorption 
on the CCC of a biocolloidal suspension by employing an appropriate MVMGCT with 
the characteristics of variations in dielectric constant of the system.  This was performed 
in the present study, where the feature of variation in size of fixed groups before and after 
cationic absorption is first included in MVMGCT.   
 
 46
cationic absorption, size of OFG becomes larger.  Note that OFG is nonuniformly 
distributed in the membrane layer of a particle, as described in Eq. (A2a).  Also, the 
typical time scales for the double-layer charge relaxation and the Brownian coagulation 
are, respectively, 10-8 s and 10-7 – 10-5 s [26,27].  The rate of slow coagulation related to 
the existence of the potential energy barrier would be slower in several orders of 
magnitude than the predicted rate of the Brownian coagulation [28].  Moreover, 
reorientation of polar substances related to the cationic absorption is typically on the 
order of 10-9 – 10-3 s [29,30].  Thus, it assumes that the equilibrium charge relaxation in 
electrical double layers and the equilibrium reaction of cationic absorptions can be 
achieved in present coagulation study.  According to the Gauss law, the charge of an 
ionic group can be esteemed to locate at the center of the species.  Since the biocolloidal 
core is rigid and impenetrable to charged species including the functional ionogenic 
groups, the inflexible core-membrane interface is tangent to both the leftmost OFG and 
CFGC, where the latter extends its size from the smaller size of the former after cationic 
absorption to form a new species near the inner membrane interface without breaking the 
hard nature.  On the other side of the biocolloidal membrane, the membrane-liquid 
interface coincides only with the margin of the rightmost CFGC because the outer 
membrane interface is nonrigid and CFGC can freely expand its size from the smaller 
OFG after cationic absorption near the soft membrane interface.  Since cationic 
absorption is much faster than coagulation, it is reasonable to assume that absorption 
equilibrium is reached and the membrane thickness contains the expended zone of CFGC 
near the membrane-liquid interface.  Referring to Fig. 1 (b), the system is divided into 7 
regions.  I, 0 < X < Xca, which is the inner charge-free membrane region.  II, Xca < X <

In these expressions, Pj,b and Pj,c (defined in Appendix) denote, respectively, the scaled 
concentration of fixed charge in region IV and in region V, φ is the distribution of the 
electrostatic potential, a vector for the presence/absence of electricity derived from the 
various charged species, (w, s, v, u), is specified for convenience that (w, s, v, u) = (0, 0, 0, 
0), (0, 0, 0, 1), (0, 0, 1, 1), (0, 1, 1, 1), (1, 0, 1, 1), (0, 0, 1, 1) and (0, 0, 1, 1) represent, 
respectively, regions I through VII, and '*ε  is the ratio of the relative permittivity of the 
7 regions to εr,dl.  '*ε  is defined as follows:

Since the biocolloidal membrane is normally thinner than the electrical double layer in 
practice, the electrostatic potential beside the core-membrane interface may not approach 
the Donnan potential.  As presented in Eq. (3a), the electrical field vanishes at the 
core-membrane interface along the radial direction because the biocolloidal core is 
typically uncharged.  Eqs. (3b) through (3g) correspond to the continuity in the 
electrical field and the electrostatic potential.  The geometrical symmetry of the 
biocolloidal coagulation system is expressed by Eq. (3h).  The electrostatic potential 
distribution can be calculated by simultaneously solving Eqs. (1), (3a)-(3h), (A2a), (A3), 
(A4) and (A5).  If the electrostatic potential at a position is known, the concentration of 
CFGC, Pj,b and Pj,c can be estimated by Eqs. (A3), (A4) and (A5), respectively.  The 
electrostatic potential can be then obtained by Eq. (1) subject to Eqs. (3a)-(3h) with the 
evaluated Pj,b and Pj,c, which are functions of scaled concentration of the fixed groups.  
That is spatial variation in ϕ can be determined for a given XL value.   
The scaled total potential energy, which is equivalent to the DLVO potential wD, 
can be estimated by  
 
wD = wvdW + wel             (4)

Influences of the system parameters on the colloidal interaction force and energy 
and on CCC of a biocolloidal suspension were studied through numerical simulation.  
Since biocolloidal membrane usually bears fixed negative charge, it can assume a 
charge-regulation model with complete dissociations of protons from acidic functional 
groups for generating the negatively charged OFGs, which possess the ability to absorb 
electrolyte cations.  Note that a calculation using different bulk electrolyte concentration, 
which determines the double-layer thickness κ-1, necessitate a modification of the scaled 
lengths and scaled distances based on κ-1 in the simulation.   
Variations in the scaled electrostatic force and the scaled total potential energy 
between two identical biocolloids as a function of the scaled half separation distance 
between them for various scaled effective radius of CFGC are presented in Fig. 2 (a) and 
(b), respectively.  As revealed in Fig. 2 (a), the electrostatic force increases with the 
scaled effective radius of CFGC.  Note that a large CFGC causes a reduction in the 
space of region V for a constant membrane thickness, i.e., the larger CFGC, the larger the 
region IV, which is the space for the fixed OFG only.  Since the valence of OFG and 
CFGC are, respectively, -2 and -1 in the present study, a larger CFGC yields (1) stronger 
negative electricity of the biocolloidal membrane, (2) a larger absolute value of the 
electrostatic potential, and (3) a larger electrostatic repulsion force.  Hence, as exhibited 
in Fig. 2 (b), the total potential energy increases with the scaled effective radius of CFGC, 
suggesting that a more stable suspension be resulted from larger CFGCs in the 
biocolloidal membrane phase.   
Figure 3 shows the variations in CCC of a biocolloidal suspension as a function of 
the effective radius of CFGC.  CCC of a biocolloidal suspension decreases with an 
 54
membrane electricity than CFGC.  Hence, a larger ri,c yields higher negative charge of 
the biocolloidal membrane and a higher CCC for the case of m = 1 because of a larger 
region IV.  On the other hand, for the case of m = 3, the main membrane phase becomes 
positively charged, and an increase in ri,c leads to an increase in the amount of OFG, 
which counteracts the electricity of positive CFGC.  Thus, a larger ri,c results in a 
smaller CCC for the case of m = 3.  Figure 4 also points out that CCC for the case of m 
= 3 is larger than that of m = 1.  This is because an OFG for the cases of m = 3 and that 
of m = 1 requires, respectively, 3 and 1 cation(s) for the absorption in region V, rendering 
m = 3 causes a larger CCC than m = 1.   
Figure 5 presents the variations in CCC of a biocolloidal suspension as a function 
of the cation-absorption equilibrium constant, K.  CCC of a biocolloidal suspension 
increases with the equilibrium constant, as revealed in Fig. 5.  This is because the 
amount of OFG in region V increases with the equilibrium constant, as revealed in Eq. 
(A1).  As a result, a larger K yields more fixed negative charge, stronger membrane 
electricity and a larger CCC.  As also exhibited in Fig. 5, CCC of a biocolloidal 
suspension increases with the nonuniform feature index of the fixed groups, α.  Since a 
larger nonuniform feature index of the fixed groups causes a more concentrated fixed 
groups near the position of Xo [20], the larger α, the larger the electrostatic repulsion 
force and CCC of a biocolloidal suspension.   
Variations in CCC of a biocolloidal suspension as a function of the ratio of the 
permittivity of the regions IV, V and VI to the permittivity of the double layer are 
displayed in Fig. 6.  As revealed in this figure, the larger 'mε , the smaller CCC of a 
biocolloidal suspension, in general.  Since a large permittivity means a high polarity of 
 56
radius of anion, the smaller CCC of a biocolloidal suspension, as demonstrated in Fig. 7.  
This is because the larger the effective size of anions, the smaller the absolute value of 
the electrostatic potential in regions II and III [32,33].  Moreover, larger anions are 
usually more difficult to penetrate across membrane, resulting in weaker auxiliary effect 
on promoting membrane negative charge.  Thus, a large ran yields a decrease in the 
electrostatic potrntial and a small CCC.   
 
4. Conclusions 
In previous study, biological entities were often described by rigid particles 
covered with ion-penetrable membrane layers, where uniformly distributed ionogenic 
groups and point-charge model were employed.  In recent literature, this membrane 
model was extended to more realistic situations for understanding of biocolloidal 
behavior via inclusion of nonuniform distributions of fixed charge, dissociations of 
functional groups and sizes of charged species.  However, absorption of cations by 
biocolloids immersed in an electrolyte solution and variation in dielectric constant, which 
commonly increases with the distance from a rigid interface, require consideration.  
Hence, in the present study, effects of cationic absorption and dielectric-constant 
variation were investigated for evaluation of the critical coagulation concentration of a 
biocolloidal suspension.  Especially, variation in the size of charged functional groups 
was first taken into account.  The simulated results indicate that a lower CCC can be 
obtained by (1) a larger effective radius of cation-functional group complex (CFGC) for 
the case of a fixed difference between radius of CFGC and that of original functional 
group (OFG), ∆, (2) a larger number of fixed OFG(s) involved in the formation of a fixed 
 58
Appendix 
If A and M represent, respectively, OFG and electrolyte cation, the equilibrium 
reaction in region V can be expressed, generally, by (AnMm)z+ ⇔ nAc- + mMa+, where n, 
m, z and c denote, respectively, the number of fixed OFG(s) and that of cation(s) involved 
in the formation of a fixed CFGC, the valence of CFGC and that of OFG.  Here, c 
assumes a positive integer and the charge balance yields z = ma - nc.  The equilibrium 
constant of the above cation-absorptive reaction, K, can be formulated by 
 
K = [Ac-]n⋅Cam/[(AnMm)z+]           (A1) 
 
where 
 
Ca = (na0/NA)⋅exp(-aϕ)            (A1a) 
 
In these expressions, [Ac-], Ca and [(AnMm)z+] denote, respectively, the concentration of 
OFG, that of cation and that of CFGC, and NA is the Avogadro number.  Eq. (A1a) 
corresponds to the Boltzmann distribution of cations in region V.  From the conservation 
of the fixed groups, which consist of OFG and CFGC, at any position in region V, we 
have  
 
[Ac-] = Nj - n[(AnMm)z+]            (A2) 
 
where 
 60
Pj,c = NA{z[(AnMm)z+]-c[Ac-]}/ana0 = NA{(z+nc)[(AnMm)z+]-cNj}/ana0   (A4) 
 
Since [(AnMm)z+] = 0 in region IV, Pj,b becomes  
 
Pj,b = NA{-c[Ac-]}/ana0 = NA(-cNj)/ana0         (A5)
