measurable. The Kalman filter (KF) [11] is the one for the purpose in the filed of engineering 
which has been applied from systems and control theory to signal processing for decades. 
However, applications of the KF in state estimation of biochemical networks are rarely found in 
the literature. For biochemical networks, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) was recently applied 
to estimate unmeasured states and the linear feedback control design for nonlinear systems by 
global linearization [12]. In [13], a discrete EKF was used to estimate parameters and states of the 
signal transduction pathway. 
While there were a few papers dealing with the issue of state estimation for biochemical 
networks, most of the approaches were based on the assumption that the noise covariances have 
to be known as a priori. Discussion for the situation of the noise with uncertain covariances is still 
lacking. In this report, a robust EKF to estimate the states and parameters of the signal 
transduction networks with intrinsic and extrinsic noises is also introduced. Error analysis for that 
kind of systems is presented. Numerical experiments have also been conducted for a noisy signal 
transduction network to verify the proposed design.

using the pre-described procedures, the originally complicated system could be transformation 
into an analyzable form. 
The Michaelis-Menten equation for biological systems has been applied to investigate the 
concentration change of metabolites in each pathway of biochemical networks, and the 
concentration change equations are further expressed as ordinary differential equations. However, 
it may cost significant computation time to analyze all cellular signal reactions and interactions 
which are not all important or critical to the signal transduction networks. How to remove the 
redundant parts is an issue.  
To simplify the analysis, we propose a cascaded analysis model to analyze the system with a 
simpler structure. A molecule that combined with a scaffold protein is a basic reaction in the 
mathematical model. This reaction can be described, for example, as a signal transduction 
pathway in Figure 1. After estimating all parameters of the S-system, one can compute the output 
concentration 1x  at the steady state. One then cascades the output concentration with a new 
molecule to generate a new signal transduction pathway. For the same reason, one can cascade 
molecules to construct a complete mathematical model as shown in Figure 2. Repeating the steps, 
one can construct a mathematical model which is easier than constructing the model at a time. 
The method is demonstrated by a signal transduction network model with one scaffold 
protein and two binding domains in Figure 3. From (1) and (2), the number of states and

Chapter 3 Stability Analysis 
Most chemical reactions in biological systems operate at a steady-state level, and normal 
concentrations in biological systems are maintained by regulatory mechanisms that stabilize the 
steady states. Effective regulation makes the concentrations return to steady states after being 
effected by external stimulation.  
In general, the power-law representation in biological systems can be considered as a 
canonical nonlinear system. By performing Taylor expansion, the power-law representation can 
be employed as a piecewise expression. It provides a global representation of which validity and 
accuracy can be governed [15]. On the other hand, the power-law representation can be employed 
as a local representation. Its accuracy within a neighborhood can be justified by investigating the 
effect resulting from the residual dynamics. 
Consider, for instance, an S-system with two variables given by

Chapter 4 Sensitivity Analysis 
When the system remains close to the steady state, sensitivity analysis provides results that 
relate steady-state concentrations and fluxes. It helps one to predict how the system performance 
is influenced by changes in related factors of concerns. It can also be used as quantitative 
measures that show how fast the responses of any system components change with parameter 
variations. In S-systems, all rate laws for individual steps of the system that tend to 
increase/decrease a given metabolite are aggregated into a net or aggregate rate law of 
synreport/degradation [16]. 
 
Logarithmic gain 
Consider the logarithmic gain of the steady-state of a metabolite with respect to a change in 
an independent variable. Our objective now is to predict how strongly changes in independent 
variables affect the steady state of the system without the need of solving the differential 
equations.  
Special interest is in the relative change in the metabolite ix  that is caused by a relative 
change in jx . We characterize the system response by describing how lni iy x=  responses to 
changes in lnj jy x= . Define the logarithmic gain; the change in iy  per unit change in jy  is 
given as the derivative of iy  with respect to jy :

correspondingly the relative change in the dependent variables.

Chapter 5 Extended Kalman Filter  
for State and Parameter Estimations 
In real biological systems, biochemical networks such as signal transduction networks, gene 
regulatory networks, and metabolic networks often are often noisy. As in engineering area of 
research, the systems’ dynamic behavior can be mathematically described by the stochastic model, 
which could be further used as a basis the purpose of analysis and control biochemical networks 
under noise corruption.  
For biochemical reactions suppose that there are M  intrinsic noise sources and extrinsic 
noise, the nonlinear stochastic dynamical biological system can be mathematically described by 
[3, 4]

where ( ) nx t ∈\  is the state which may denote a vector of protein concentrations of n  genes 
for gene networks, ( )f ⋅  and ( )g ⋅  are nonlinear function vectors, ( )in t  is an intrinsic noise 
source which is a white noise with zero mean and standard deviation iσ , ( )w t  is an extrinsic 
noise source with zero mean and standard deviation wσ . Such stochastic fluctuations may affect 
the kinetic parameters of the dynamic equation. Therefore, the system equation of (27) may suffer 
from intrinsic noises due to the M  kinetic parameter fluctuations. 
 
Remark: The system suffering from intrinsic noises in (27) could also be rewritten as the 
following Ito stochastic equation:

2 2( ) ( ) wE W t W tτ σ τ⎡ ⎤− = −⎣ ⎦  where [ ]E ⋅  denotes the operation of expectation. The formulation 
also applies for a general nonlinear gene network with n  genes.  
 
After the stochastic differential system in (27) or (28) is modeled to mimic the realistic 
behaviors of the object, some design specifications can be proposed for robust design of the 
system so that the desired behaviors or products can be achieved in spite of intrinsic parameter

Chapter 8 Conclusions 
First Year 
This research has proposed a method for constructing the dynamic model of signal 
transduction networks and a primary control design has been proposed for the system. A cascaded 
analysis model for constructing the signal transduction network model has been proposed. The 
stability condition for the linearized S-system has been derived. A successful example of the 
biochemical system of one scaffold protein with two binding domains is presented for 
demonstration. On the basis of the ODEs obtained, it is expected that the traditional control 
theory can be applied to prompt biochemical reactions of the signal transduction networks on the 
theoretical basis. 
 
Second Year 
This research also proposed a continuous EKF to estimate state variables and parameters of 
a class of biochemical systems while the signal transduction networks are corrupted by intrinsic 
and extrinsic noises and parameter uncertainty. Performance analysis for the EKF design has been 
conducted. Numerical simulations have confirmed effectiveness of the proposed method for 
designing the robust EKF for biological systems.  
 
The ultimate goal of this project is to realize a class of signalling networks to represent the 
proposed controller/estimator in the future. We could program cell behaviors by embedding 
synthetic gene networks that perform digital and analog computation, communications, and 
signal processing. The way to this aim will begin with constructing a genetic component library 
and a biocircuit design methodology for assembling these components into compound circuits. 
Simulation tools could be used to guide circuit design. Development of the regulator device of the 
intracellular networks of the whole system should be verified numerically first, if possible, 
conducting some experimental verifications.  
 
It is anticipated that accomplishment of this research will not only understand in depth of the 
versatile hereditary sickness and cancers but also contribute to predict influence of the medicine 
for the pathological changes to the cells.

Control Design for Signal Transduction Networks
Chun-Liang Lin, Yuan-Wei Liu and Chia-Hua Chuang

Abstract: Signal transduction networks of biological systems are highly complex. How to mathematically describe a signal 
transduction network by systematic approaches to further develop an appropriate and effective control strategy is attractive 
to control engineers. In this paper, the synergism and saturation system (S-systems) representations are used to describe 
signal transduction networks and a control design idea is presented. For constructing mathematical models, a cascaded 
analysis model is fi rst proposed. Dynamic analysis and controller design are simulated and verifi ed.
Keywords: signal transduction networks, biochemical networks, systems biology, control, stability
Introduction
Recently, interdisciplinary studies are becoming popular; one of the most attractive studies is to combine 
both biological systems and control engineering.1,2,3 Signal transduction networks of biological systems 
are characterized as high complexity because they are composed of many biochemical reactions. 
Typical modeling process for that kind of systems may involve the following issues: modeling, dynamic 
analysis and steady-state analysis.4,5 However, the complexity of cellular signal transduction network 
is in general incomprehensible. Thus, an effective method to develop a mathematically equivalent model 
of the biochemical networks is highly desirable.
The synergism and saturation system (S-system)6 has been a well-studied approach in modeling 
biochemical networks which characterizes the signal transduction networks. It was shown that the 
S-system representation in terms of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is capable of capturing the 
behavior of biochemical dynamics. Applying logarithm on the state variables linearizes the state equa-
tions of the S-system at steady state. Based on the linearized S-system, it is possible to analyze and 
predict the S-system behavior rather than directly resorting to the original nonlinear model. In,1 a lin-
earized S-system was derived and the robust stability analysis was conducted. In7, the properties of 
cascaded signal transduction pathway, robust and optimal design of system circuit and rule of gene 
regulation were introduced. Based on the steady-state analyses of the S-system model, a robust control 
method is proposed for biochemical networks via feedback and feedforward biochemical circuits was 
proposed by.8,9 The proposed robust circuit design schemes provide a systematic method with applica-
tions in synthetic circuit design for biotechnological purpose.
The purpose of this paper is to model and analyze the signal transduction networks in biological 
systems and transform the mathematical model from the uncontrollable and nonlinear form to a control-
lable and linear form. We adopt the S-system and the Michaelis-Menten rate law to drive a mathemat-
ical model for signaling transduction networks. For simplifying the construction of the mathematical 
model, a method called ‘cascaded analysis model’ is proposed. The model is intended to be used for 
constructing a simplifi ed mathematical model in the form of S-systems. This method avoids directly 
solving the entire mathematical model, which could be extremely complicated in structure. Rather, the 
problem can be broken down into smaller partitions to lessen computational burden.
Stability analysis is also presented. The Lyapunov stability theory is applied to determine stability 
of the S-system under Taylor expansion which could be used to estimate stability margin of the bio-
logical system without control. A new control design idea for the nonlinear S-systems is then attempted. 
By applying feedback linearization,10 a proper coordinate transformation can be derived to establish an 
effective method for control of the nonlinear systems with smooth nonlinearities, which are nonlinear 
in their state variables but linear in their control variables. For S-systems, dependent variables can be

According to (7), one can obtain the steady 
states y i ni , , ...,=1  given by
 
  y A b A yD D I I= −
−1( )  (8)
using the pre-described procedures, the originally 
complicated system could be transformation into 
an analyzable form.
The Michaelis-Menten equation for biological 
systems has been applied to investigate the concen-
tration change of metabolites in each pathway of 
biochemical networks, and the concentration change 
equations are further expressed as ordinary differ-
ential equations. However, it may cost signifi cant 
computation time to analyze all cellular signal reac-
tions and interactions which are not all important 
or critical to the signal transduction networks. How 
to remove the redundant parts is an issue.
To simplify the analysis, we propose a cascaded 
analysis model to analyze the system with a simpler 
structure. A molecule that combined with a scaffold 
protein is a basic reaction in the mathematical model. 
This reaction can be described, for example, as a 
signal transduction pathway in Figure 1. After esti-
mating all parameters of the S-system, one can 
compute the output concentration x1 at the steady 
state. One then cascades the output concentration 
with a new molecule to generate a new signal trans-
duction pathway. For the same reason, one can 
cascade molecules to construct a complete mathe-
matical model as shown in Figure 2. Repeating the 
steps, one can construct a mathematical model which 
is easier than constructing the model at a time.
The method is demonstrated by a signal trans-
duction network model with one scaffold protein 
and two binding domains in Figure 3. From (1) and 
(2), the number of states and pathways are 4 and 5, 
respectively. We neglect the redundant pathways 
described by (4) to simplify the complete model. 
The number of pathways of the new model 
becomes 4. We defi ne states (S) and molecules as 
state variables xi and implement the pathways to 
reactions. We can then modify reactions and 
construct new signal transduction pathways as 
shown in Figure 4.
On the basis of the signal transduction pathways 
in Figure 4, three independent variables (x7, x8, x9), 
which are outside signal of the signal transduction 
networks, are introduced to construct the analyz-
able model (Fig. 5). Applying the cascaded analy-
sis model and considering the top part in Figure 5, 
we separate the pathways into two parts and defi ne 
a new variable zi to substitute xi as indicated in 
Figure 6.
Consider part 1 in Figure 6, the system includes 
three dependent variables (z1, z2, z3) and two inde-
pendent variables (z4, z5), and the fl uxes contain 
variables (V +, V −). The S-system is built as

the composition of functions. Thus the function

In the fi rst stage of control design, the gain 
vector K should be chosen so that Ac would be 
stable. Stability analysis of the uncertain control 
system is next carried out by using Lyapunov 
stability theory.
To proceed, a Lyapunov candidate function is 
defi ned as follows
 V z z PzT( ) =  (31)
where P = PT  0.
Taking derivative with respect to time gives
 
V z z A P PA z z PB B zT c
T
c
T( ) ( ) ( )= + + 2 Δ  (32)
As Ac has been a stable matrix, for any Q = QT  0, 
there is a unique symmetric positive defi nite solut-
ion P to the following Lyapunov matrix equation:
 A P PA Qc
T
c+ = −  (33)
Substituting (33) into (32) gives
 
V Q z z PB B zT≤ − +λmin ( ) ( )2

(34)
If there exists a constant α with λmin(Q)  α such 
that

2z PB B z zT Δ ( ) ≤ α
 
(35)
Then (34) becomes
 
V Q z≤ − −[ ]λ αmin ( ) 22  (36)
Clearly, one can have ·V(x)  0, i.e. asymptotic 
stability of the uncertain system under feedback 
control, by the suitably chosen matrix Q.

Consider the signal transduction network illus-
trated in Figure 9. Let one of the independent 
variable x3 be the control variable and the depen-

order to discern the control variable and state vari-

are 0.0604  z1  0.9141 and −0.0836  z2  0, 
respectively. Considering the extreme case of (60), 
one can fi nd
 0 0852 1. ≤ α  (65)
According to (61) and (65), the permissible range 
of α1 is then given by
 0 0852 11. ≤ <α  (66)
Similarly, the permissible range of α2 is
 0 0426 0 52. .≤ <α  (67)
On the basis of (66) and (67), one can easily fi nd 
that the permissible range of α is proportional to 
the magnitude of Q.

 Abstract—A DNA computing algorithm (DNACA) with an 
electron-ion interaction potential (EIIP) decoding scheme is proposed 
to identify a class of transfer functions. The DNACA includes 
crossover, mutation, enzyme and virus operators providing a highly 
modular, flexible, and accurate self-organizing structure. Simulation 
study based on the De Jong’s test functions show its superior 
performance when compared with the improved and standard genetic 
algorithms (GAs). The algorithm is also applied to control design with 
the simplest controller through special frameshift mutation such as 
enzyme and virus. 
 
Keywords—DNA computing algorithm, Electron-ion interaction 
potential, Systems identification 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
ECENTLY developed DNA computing algorithms 
(DNACAs) have inspired new methods that can 
simultaneously solve the parameter and structure optimization 
problems. The DNACAs based on the concept of bimolecular 
evolution was first developed by Adleman in [1]. Maley further 
detailed this kind of algorithms in terms of chemical processes 
and computer programming [2].   
The operational features inherent in DNACAs make the 
algorithms implementable in the future DNA computers which 
are over a billion times possible to implement more 
computationally efficient than the conventional computers. The 
massively parallel nature of DNA in those computers means 
that computation may be millions or billions of times beyond 
today’s supercomputers [3-7]. 
In this paper, accuracy of the proposed DNACA with or 
without frameshift operators is verified first by numerical tests 
with the electron-ion interaction potential (EIIP) [8-10] 
decoding scheme.  
Two of the competitive applications of DNACAs are on the 
 
Manuscript received January 31, 2009. This research was sponsored by

system identification (ID) and control design. System ID is 
essential for control designs based on the process model, which 
go from PID controller [11, 12] to more sophisticated methods 
such as 2H  control [13] and is applicable to the robust control 
design [14-16]. With regard to system ID, DNA strings are 
created here to represent transfer function models in which 
codons are used to represent coefficients of the denominator 
and numerator polynomials. Using frameshift operators 
(enzyme and virus), the order and numeric values of the 
transfer function model can be refined to fit the objective of 
finding the simplest ID model. The proposed approach is 
verified by testing a group of the De Jong’s functions given in 
[17]. Verification of the simulated results shows that the 
proposed method performed well, even for the system models 
with wide dynamic responses. Application to robust control 
design is also investigated and simulated result is presented. 
II. BIOLOGICAL COMPUTATION ALGORITHMS 
A DNA strand comprises of two complimentary strings in 
which four nucleotide base: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine 
(G), and thymine (T)—are arranged in various combinations. 
Nucleotides are paired along with two strings. One DNA string 
can be separated from the other through chemical process. As 
the other string is a perfect compliment, for the purpose of 
computation simplicity only one string is needed to further 
operations in next generation. 
The biological computation algorithm calculates the fitness 
function and gets the best solution during evolution of 
generations in terms of DNA coding schemes. The property of 
electro-ion interaction potential (EIIP) decoding can be applied 
in biological computation process and designed to calculate the 
fitness values. The system computation processes are as 
follows.  
A. The DNA Computation Algorithms 
The design flow of the DNACA and decoding process with 
EIIP as shown in Fig.1 is described in the follows.  
Step 1: Randomly generated a group of DNA sequences. 
Step 2: Perform DNA coding scheme for each DNA 
sequence.  
Step 3: The DNA codons within the DNA sequences are 
translated to amino acids.  
Step 4: The amino acids are converted to the EIIP levels.

The DNACAs consist of several operators in which a 
crossover operation is used to generate a new strand that will 
retain beneficial features from the parent generation. This 
exploits current genetic potential. If the population doesn’t 
contain enough encoded information to solve a particular 
problem, none of the mixing strands can produce a satisfactory 
solution.  
The mutation operator capable is spontaneously generating 
new strands which provide a mechanism to maintain the 
population’s diversity. In addition to the crossover and 
mutation operators, there are two frameshift operators, i.e. 
enzyme and virus, which will be explained in more details 
subsequently. 
C. Crossover Operation with DNA sequences 
The crossover operation causes recombination and 
information exchange of DNA sequences in a probabilistic way. 
Two DNA sequences are chosen from the current population 
and swap partial genes with each other. The variety of 
crossover algorithms work depending on the crossover rate (
cP ) 
and the number of crossover points. Three types of crossover 
strategies have commonly been adopted [19]. 
The first one is two-point crossover operation, tpc , that 
produces an intermediate population ' ' '

The two-point crossover operation is a process of exchanging 
DNA information. The DNA sequence is divided into three 
sub-DNA sequences by the two points and crossovered each 
other by swapping the sequences between the first and third 
sub-DNA sequences. By this method, depending on the 
crossover points, a DNA sequence can be drastically changed. 
After crossover operation, the original DNA sequences 
between the two crossover points are exchanged as illustrated 
in Fig. 3.

F. Enzyme Operation with DNA sequence 
The enzyme mutation works to separate and connect two 
DNA substrings while removing an intermediate fragment. The 
newly formed codon breaks away from the doped position and 
the reacted remainder of codons are joined together to form a 
new one. The direct consequence of this operation is that the 
resulting DNA string loses some information in the next 
generation, as displayed in Fig. 6. The net effect is to help the 
reacting molecules go through chemical changes more rapidly.  
To realize the effect, let the codons eliminated by enzyme 
effect be

III. ANALYSIS METHODS 
A. Configurable ID model 
There have been traditional or advanced approaches widely 
applied to deal with the system ID problem [20-22]. We 
consider here a novel application of DNACA to tackle the 
problem.  
Consider a class of transfer functions modeled as follows

where 2  and 2= + = + n n n d d dn n m n n m  with d nn n≥   assure 
the transfer function to be proper. In traditional system ID 
methodologies, the least mean square error scheme is adopted 
to construct a transfer function so that it ultimately mimics the 
dynamic behavior of the identified object. The resulting 
transfer function, however, might not possess the simplest 
structure, i.e. the one is not necessarily with the minimum 
order.  
The objective function for the current problem is defined as

respectively, the magnitude and phase of the frequency 
response; tf  is the total sampling number over the testing 
frequency interval. Here, J1 denotes the magnitude error at the 
lowest frequency; whereas J2 and J3 calculate, respectively, the 
overall errors of the magnitude and phase over the whole 
spectrum.  
 
B. Extension to Control Design 
Consider the control system shown in Fig. 7 with its 
controller ( )EC s  described in the form of (3). The following 
condition is a fundamental requirement for the nominal 
closed-loop stability: 
( )Re ( ) 0,i s iλ Λ < ∀                                (8) 
where iλ  are the roots of the characteristic polynomial ( )sΛ  of 
the nominal closed-loop system. 
The condition for internal stability is ensured by 
incorporating the following constraint:

so that there won’t be excessive control commands, especially 
at higher frequencies.  
The conditions for robust stability and sensitivity reduction 
have been well known [5-7] and are given, respectively, as 
follows

This  is a typical test function to deal with the optimization. 
The point (1, 1) is a minimum of zero and it is very difficult to

This is a generalized rastrigin’s function. It possesses multiple

optimization algorithms.

For each test function, the iteration and population numbers 
are set to be 50 and 10, respectively. The probability rates of 
crossover and mutation are 0.8 and 0.2, respectively. Both of 
the probability rates of enzyme and virus are 0.4. The results 
of the solution are searched by using the proposed DNACA as 
shown in Fig. 8 and Table II. Taking 
4D  and 5D  as the 
example, the efficiency of DNACA with/without frameshift 
operators is illustrated as in Table III. Convergence of the 
fitness values for 
4D  and 5D  is displayed as in Fig. 9. It is seen 
that the DNACA produces not only accurate solutions, it 
simultaneously prevents the redundant candidate strings from 
being repeated in the evolutionary process. These results 
demonstrate efficiency and performance of the presented 
algorithm.

V. CONCLUSIONS 
A DNA computing algorithm with new coding method based 
on EIIP of DNA codons is introduced. The EIIP is used instead 
of the traditional binary coding system. Capability for seeking 
the solutions of the multiple variable functions is confirmed by 
considering a class of De Jong’s functions as the testing object. 
The proposed DNACA has also been successfully extended to 
deal with the system ID and control design problem. Numerical 
experiments confirm its excellence for these problems. The 
algorithm’s multiple mutation mechanism allows it to simplify 
the model structure simultaneously while generating the 
optimal parameter set during the evolution process.

Abstract—Signal transduction networks of biological 
systems are highly complicated. How to mathematically 
describe a signal transduction network by systematic 
approaches so as to further exploit appropriate control 
strategies is becoming attractive to engineers. In this 
paper, a mathematical model of signal transduction 
networks with a simplified structure is proposed and 
related analyses are performed. 
 
Keywords—biological system, S-system, sensitivity, signal 
transduction network 
I. INTRODUCTION 
HERE are plenty of publication dedicated in 
construction of the biochemical networks and gene 
networks, see, for example, [1-4]. Within theses networks, 
signal transduction networks of biological systems are 
characterized by their high complexity level, and the 
networks are composed of many biochemical reactions. 
The complexity of cellular signal transduction network is 
incomprehensible. Thus, an effective method to develop a 
mathematically equivalent model of the biochemical 
networks is highly desirable.  
The synergism and saturation system (S-system) in [1, 
5] has been a well-studied approach in modeling 
biochemical networks which characterizes the signal 
transduction networks. It was shown that the S-system 
representation in terms of ordinary differential equations 
(ODEs) is capable of capturing behaviors of the 
biochemical dynamics. Applying logarithm on the state 
variables further linearizes the state equations of the 
S-system at steady state. Based on the linearlized 
S-system, it is possible to analyze and predict the system

behavior without directly resorting to the original 
nonlinear model. A linearized S-system was presented 
and the robust stability analysis was proposed in [6].  
Instead of the S-system description, the Michaelis- 
Menten equation [7, 8] was widely adopted in modeling 
of biological systems. With the concentration change 
equations expressed as ODEs, the concentration change 
of metabolites in each pathway of biochemical networks 
was investigated. However, it may cost significant 
computation time to analyze all cellular signal reactions 
and interactions which are not all important and crucial to 
the signal transduction networks. Removing the 
redundant parts is thus an issue worthy of further 
concerns. 
For simplifying the construction of the mathematical 
model, we propose a method called as the cascaded 
analysis model. The cascaded analysis model is used to 
construct a mathematical model of the S-systems form. 
On the basis of the model, we do not need to solve the 
complete model, which can be extremely complicated 
structurally, in a single iteration. Rather, the problem can 
be broken down into smaller partitions to lessen 
computational burden. 
The purpose of this paper is to model and analyze the 
signal transduction networks in biological systems and 
transform the mathematical model described by the 
S-system and the Michaelis-Menten rate law to a reduced 
system model. With the simplified model, there will be 
less computational efforts while performing related 
analysis and even leading to simpler control designs. A 
example for is presented for demonstration.  
II. ANALYSIS METHODS  
A signal transduction network includes many scaffolds 
which can be bound with molecules. The entire pathways 
which would influence reactions are too large to be 
conducted, and it requires an effective method for 
constructing a mathematical model. We demonstrate a 
new method and construct the mathematical model in the 
follows.

that all dependent variables have been separated from the 
independent variables.  
   From (11), the solution of Dy
G
 is obtained as 
( )1D D I Iy A b A y−= −GG G  (12) 
provided that DA  is invertible. By using the 
pre-described procedure, the originally complicated 
system could be further transformed into an analyzable 
form.  
B.  Cascaded Analysis Model  
To simplify the mathematical analysis, we propose here 
a cascaded analysis model. This is used to construct a 
simplified mathematical model of an S-system. With it, 
one does not need to solve the complete model, rather, the 
problem is broken down into smaller partitions to lessen 
computational burden.  
A molecule bind with a scaffold protein is the basic 
reactions in the mathematical model. The basic reaction 
can be described as a signal transduction pathway as 
shown in Fig. 3. By the Michaelis-Menten rate law, the 
reactions can be presented as ODEs and built as an 
S-system.  
After estimating all parameters of the S-system, one 
can compute the output concentration 1x  at the steady 
state. On the basis of the output concentration, we cascade 
the output concentration with a new molecule to generate 
a new signal transduction pathway as shown in Fig. 4. 
With the same reason, we can cascade molecules to 
construct a complete mathematical model as shown in Fig. 
5. Applying the cascaded analysis model, one can 
construct the mathematical model step by step that is 
more easily than construct the model at a time.

One can proceed to perform steady state analysis for the 
subsequent layer in the similar way.  
Using the cascaded analysis model, the original 
complete model can be replaced by a simplified one. This 
is useful for the purpose of numerical analysis of the large 
biochemical systems. 
C. Parameter Thresholds 
For S-systems, the local stability analysis can be 
accomplished with simple linear algebra techniques. One 
can linearize the nonlinear biochemical system around the 
steady status to yield a linear one. Then, proceeding to 
analyze the linear biochemical system would provide a 
useful insight into the nonlinear system.  
Consider the biochemical systems, which have been 
modeled as an S-system at the steady state. By using the 
Gershgorin theory, the eigenvalues of the S-system at 
steady state satisfy the following inequalities:  
1
,    1, 2,...,
n
ii ij

and 
1
,    1, 2,...,
n
ii ji

j i
a a i nλ

− ≤ =∑  (18) 
where λ  denotes the eigenvalue and ija denotes the 
element of the system matrix. The inequalities above 
characterize n Gershgorin discs which can be used to 
estimate distribution of all eigenvalues. 
For example, consider an S-system model of three 
dependent variables as follows  
1 0.5
1 3 1
0.5 0.5

Applying the Gershgorin theory, we can obtain three 
Gershgorin discs shown as in Fig. 10. The discs one and 
two are two cycles with the center at  -0.5 and the radius  
0.5. The disc three has the center at -0.5 and the radius 1.

It is also interested in determining the parameter 
threshold of the biochemical system under which the 
system will exhibit stability. To this aim, the F-factors of 
S-systems are introduced here, which are defined as the 
relative fluxes at steady state and can be computed from 
the following equation:

⎛ ⎞ ⎛ ⎞= =⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟⎝ ⎠ ⎝ ⎠∏ ∏  (19) 
where iSx  and jSx  denote, respectively, the steady states 
of ix  and jx . By applying the F-factors to the system 
matrix, the characteristic polynomial ( )λΔ  can be 
determined as

It is straightforward to determine the threshold of 
parameter values, within which the system would be 
stable, by applying the Routh-Hurwitz criterion.

IV. CONCLUSION 
This paper presents a method for constructing the 
dynamic model of signal transduction networks. A 
cascaded analysis method is proposed for constructing 
simplified mathematical models of signal transduction 
networks and related analyses are performed. A 
numerical example of the biochemical system of one 
scaffold protein with two binding domains is presented 
for demonstration. On the basis of the ODEs obtained, it 
is expected that the traditional control theory can be 
applied to prompt biochemical reactions of the signal 
transduction networks on the theoretical basis.
