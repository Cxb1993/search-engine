complex material eigenvectors to real material properties. Several real matrices 
connecting through this eigen-relation, such as the fundamental elasticity matrix N and 
Barnett-Lothe tensors L, S and H, become crucial when the analytical solutions lead to 
real form expressions. Thus, to understand the effects of material properties on some 
problems of anisotropic elasticity, it is important to know the details of these matrices and 
hence many studies have been done in the literature to get the explicit expressions of A, 
B, N, L, S and H and most of them can be found in (Ting, 1996).  
 Due to the intrinsic coupling phenomenon between mechanical and electric fields, 
piezoelectric materials have been widely used as sensors and actuators in intelligent 
advanced structure design. To study their electromechanical behaviors, suitable 
mathematical modeling becomes important. Since the extended Stroh formalism for 
piezoelectric materials preserves most essential features of Stroh formalism, it becomes a 
popular tool for the study of piezoelectric anisotropic elasticity. Most of the analytical 
solutions presented in the literature such as (Barnett and Lothe, 1975; Pak, 1990; Sosa, 
1992; Kuo and Barnett, 1991; Suo, et al., 1992; Park and Sun, 1995; Liang and Hwu, 
1996) show that the solutions for the problems of piezoelectric anisotropic materials can 
be purposely organized to have the same mathematical forms as those of the 
corresponding anisotropic elastic materials. This observation tells us the importance of 
getting the corresponding explicit expressions of A, B, N, L, S and H for piezoelectric 
materials. However, due to its possible complexity involving piezoelectric effects, very 
few research efforts have been focused on this study. Suo, et al. (1992) mentioned the 
structures of the inverse of impedance matrix 1ABi and provided explicit forms for 
some simple cases. Ting (1996) discussed the structures of 1N  and 3N  for general 
piezoelectric materials without detailed expressions. Soh, et al. (2001) provided explicit 
expressions of A, B, L, S and H for transversely isotropic piezoelectric materials whose 
poling axis coincides with 2x -axis and monoclinic piezoelectric materials, respectively. 
In this project, solutions are provided for general piezoelectric materials covering all the 
possible two-dimensional states such as generalized plane strain/ short or open circuit, 
and generalized plane stress/ short or open circuit. The explicit expressions for A, B and 
N obtained in this project are valid for all possible piezoelectric anisotropic materials. 
While for L, S and H, standard procedure can be applied for all possible piezoelectric 
anisotropic materials and the explicit expressions are given only for two special examples: 
piezoelectric ceramics poling in two different axes. 
  
2. Singular Orders of Piezoelectric Multiwedges 
Consider a piezoelectric multi-wedge that consists of n different piezoelectric 
anisotropic elastic wedges (see Figure 1). Assume perfect bond along each interface 
between two dissimilar wedges and each wedge occupies the region

The traction/induction and displacement/electric-potential continuity across each 
interface k  , 1......, 2, ,1  nk , between two dissimilar wedges can be written as 
,1 ......, 2, ,1     ),()(     ),()( 11   nkkkkkkkkk  uu  (2) 
where ku  and k  are the vectors of displacements and stress function of the kth wedge; 
the argument k  denotes the values at the interface k  , and the subscript k or k+1

k , 1k  are the angular location of the two sides of the kth wedge, and Nˆ  is the key

be bounded, in our study we only consider the region 1)Re(0   .                          
 Although the singular orders in composite piezoelectric wedges and junctions have 
been presented in the literature such as (Xu and Rajapakse, 2000; Weng and Chue, 2004), 
their results leave the solutions to a system of simultaneous algebraic equations whose 
details are usually ignored due to complexity. Here, the solutions are explicitly expressed 
by the multiplication of the key matrix as those shown in (4). Moreover, they are exactly 
the same as the corresponding anisotropic problems (Hwu, et al., 2003; Hwu and Lee, 
2004). To show the correctness for the present piezoelectric cases, comparison has been 
made with (Xu and Rajapakse, 2000) by considering a PZT-4 wedge with polarization 
direction along the 2x -axis, and a bi-wedge bonded by PZT-4 and PZT-5. The material 
properties of PZT-4 and PZT-5 are,

3. Contact Problems of Piezoelectric Materials 
Contact problem is one kind of mixed boundary value problems. Most of the 
analytical formula for contact problems can be found in many textbooks. Combining the 
complex variable formulation with the method of analytical continuation, Muskhelishvili 
(1954) and England (1971) provided solutions for several types of punch problems on 
isotropic elastic bodies.  
Usually, the mathematical model of elasticity can be divided into two parts. One is 
the basic equations which include equilibrium equations, constitutive laws and kinematic 
relations. The other is the boundary conditions which can be distinguished into traction, 
displacement and mixed boundary value problems. Once a problem is formulated based 
upon the basic equation, its solvability is usually dependent on the boundary conditions. 
As to the same boundary geometry, the mixed boundary value problems are more

Abstract 
In the first year of this project, four different types of problems were solved: (1) 
mathematical model for piezoelectric anisotropic elasticity; (2) singular orders of 
piezoelectric multiwedges; (3) contact problems of piezoelectric materials; (4) coupled 
stretching-bending analysis for piezoelectric laminates. Following the results of the first 
year, in this year another four problems were done. They are: (1) fracture parameters for 
piezoelectric materials; (2) stress intensity factors of piezoelectric multiwedges; (3) BEM 
design for contact problems of piezoelectric materials; (4) BEM design for piezoelectric 
laminates. Most of the works have been completed during this year. 
 
Keywords: piezoelectric materials, anisotropic elasticity, contact problem, piezoelectric 
multiwedges, electromechanical analysis, boundary element analysis, stretching-bending 
coupling analysis, multi-scaled finite element analysis, fracture parameters, 
corners/interface corners, cracks/interface cracks, molecular dynamic simulation, 
nanoindentation 
 
1. Fracture Parameters for Piezoelectric Materials 
After setting up the mathematical model for piezoelectric anisotropic elasticity and 
obtaining the explicit expressions for the important matrices involved in the extended 
Stroh formalism (Hwu, 2008), the main task of this year is exploring the appropriate 
definition for the fracture parameters of piezoelectric materials, especially for the cases of 
corner problems.  
  19
In our study we also found that if only the most critical singular order is considered, 
certain modes of stress intensity factors will be lost even though the specimen is 
subjected to mixed-mode loading. The missing modes may come from the stress/electric 
fields associated with the lower singular orders. Hence, to provide a proper definition for 
the stress/electric intensity factors associated with the lower singular orders, the near tip 
solutions (2) should be extended to include all the possible singular orders, i.e.,

After finding the proper definition for the stress intensity factors of general corners 
of piezoelectric materials, the singular characteristics of cracks or interface cracks in 
piezoelectric materials can be studied through the singular orders of stresses, the near tip 
solutions and the relations between crack opening displacement, strain energy density, 
and stress intensity factors (Hwu and Ikeda, 2008). 
 
2. Stress Intensity Factors of Piezoelectric Multiwedges 
To provide a stable and efficient computing approach for the general mixed-mode 
stress intensity factors, similar to the anisotropic multiwedges studied in our previous 
project, the path-independent H-integral based on reciprocal theorem of Betti and 
Rayleigh is also adopted in the present study, which is 
ˆ ˆ( )d ,T TH    u t u t  (6)
where   is a counterclockwise integral path with arbitrary shape which emanates from 
the lower corner flank ( 0  ) and terminates at the upper corner flank ( n  ); u and t 
are the generalized displacement and traction vectors of the actual system which can be 
obtained through any method, e.g. finite element analyses, boundary element analyses, or 
even experiment measurements, while uˆ  and tˆ  are those of the auxiliary system with 
singular order 2  .  
Expressed in component form, the H-integral (6) can be written as

BEM is much more efficient and accurate than FEM if its associated fundamental 
solution can be found analytically. With this understanding, in this topic we develop a 
special BEM that may be helpful for the characterization of micro- or nano-materials. 
One of the tools that are widely used for such measurement is depth-sensing indentation.

To develop an accurate and efficient BEM dealing with indentation problems, in this 
study the Green’s function of anisotropic bimaterials is used as the fundamental solutions 
of BEM. Through this BEM, the stress analysis of indentation on layered materials can be 
performed more accurate and efficient. In this study, the corresponding Green’s functions 
of piezoelectric bi-materials have been obtained and employed to construct the BEM for 
the contact problems of piezoelectric materials. They are (refer to (Chen and Hwu, 2010)

setting of boundary source points, etc. In the first year of this project, the main task is the 
finding of the Green’s functions for piezoelectric materials, which has been done and the 
results ar published in (Chen and Hwu, 2010). While this year, our main attention was 
focused on the establishment of the boundary integral equations for the 
stretching-bending coupling analysis of composite laminates. We start from the 
reciprocal theorem of Betti and Raleigh as that shown in eqn.(6). Starting from this 
theorem, the boundary integral equations for symmetric/unsymmetric laminates were 
derived in our previous project (NSC 95-2221-E-006- 240) and should be revised when 
we tried to implement these boundary integral equations on BEM in this project. 
Following is the revised version of the boundary integral equations

design BEM by following the standard procedures stated in most of the textbooks on

1. Multi-Scaled Finite Element Analysis 
After defining the proper definitions for fracture parameters, it is interesting to apply 
these definitions on real engineering devices. It is known that electric devices are 
composed of many different parts and hence many interface corners exist in several local 
fields of an electric device, which are usually the sources of failure. However, to calculate 
the stress intensity factors on any possible failure locations, it will always take a lot of 
computing time for full and detailed analysis. Therefore, in the last year of this project we 
explore the possibility of using the multi-scaled finite element technique to expedite our 
calculation and also preserve the accuracy of our results. The main concept here is 
finding the equivalent moduli for each part of the electric devices. This concept can be 
applied on several different scales. After getting the equivalent moduli for each 
component of the electric devices, we treat the original devices as an inhomogeneous 
elastic body and use a suitable commercial finite element code to get the stresses and 
deformations of the actual system. With this relatively starting coarse analysis, we use the 
concept of subdomain analysis to go ahead for the detailed analysis of possible local 
failure locations. Finally, applying the H-integral proposed in the second year’s research 
to calculate the stress intensity factors for the possible local failure locations. Following 
is an example done through this process. 
 
Example: A representative block of electronic package subjected to tensile loading 
For the purpose of giving a good connection between the present method and the 
real engineering problem, a representative block of electronic package is discussed in this 
example. Figure 1 is a quarter plot of the representative block in which the interface 
corner between the solder ball and BT substrate is analyzed to discuss the effect of the 
radius of solder ball (B1) on the stress intensity factors. The dimensions of each portion 
are also shown in Figure 1 in which B2=0.8*B1 and B3=0.6*B1. This discussion is 
helpful to realize the relevancy between the radius of solder ball and the reliability of 
electronic package. The boundary and loading conditions are: the entire bottom of the 
block is clamped and the entire top is subjected to 10MPao  . The properties of each 
constitutive material are assumed to be linear elastic and listed in Table 1. The singular 
orders are obtained as 1 0.4946   and 2 0.3741  , and each one is accompanied with 
only one real eigenfunction. From the numerical calculation, we see that if only the most 
critical singular order is considered the mode-III stress intensity factor will be lost. The 
mode-III stress intensity factor will be obtained only when the next higher singular order 
is taken into account. However, the values of IIIK  on the entire crack front are equal to 
zero because of the axially symmetric properties of this example. Table 2 lists the trends 
of stress intensity factors versus radii of solder balls, from which we see that under the 
same loading and boundary conditions the stress intensity factors will decrease when the 
size of solder ball increases. 
 
  29
intensity factor pICK  varies with the loading angle   and the notch ratio /a c  are 
shown in Figures 3a and 3b. In these two figures, the small circle ‘  ’ denotes the average 
value of pICK  from various tests, and the horizontal bars above and below the small circle 
stand for the variation of pICK  from various tests, and the dash line shows the mean value. 
From these two figures, we see that the critical stress intensity factor pICK  can really be 
treated as a material constant independent of the geometry and loading conditions. 
Therefore, it is very possible that we can predict the sharp notch fracture through the 
following fracture criterion 
.p pI ICK K                                (1) 
 After this work, we will try to slightly change the material properties on one part of 
the homogeneous materials to make the corner become interface corner. By smoothly 
increasing the difference of the two dissimilar material properties and smoothly changing 
the angle of the corner, it is hopeful for us to observe the relations of failure criteria 
between homogeneous corners, homogeneous cracks, interface cracks and interface 
corners. 
 
3. Improvement on the Existing Technique of Nanoindentation 
Nanoindentation is a popular tool for measuring the mechanical properties of thin 
film on nano-scale. In its implementation, some post experimental works which are 
important for getting the mechanical properties are based upon the solutions obtained 
from the contact problems of linear elastic materials. Since many assumptions which are 
not compatible with real test have been made in the theoretical modeling, many 
improvement suggestions have been proposed in the literature such as (Oliver and Pharr, 
1992; Kim, et al., 2006). Here, we explore the possibility of improvement by using our 
results obtained in the first two years of this project on contact problems. In our study, we 
built an artificial neural network through the analysis results of contact problems. In this 
network, the input variables are the coefficients of load-indentation curve, and the output 
variables are the Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio. Thus, if we get a load-indentation 
curve through the experiment of nano-indentation, we can then predict the Young’s 
modulus and Poisson’s ration of the test specimen. Figure 4 is the result of one example 
of our study. 
In our study we met the challenge about the suitability of two-dimensional 
modelling on nanoindentation, which is usually treated by axi-symmetrical modeling or 
three-dimensional modeling. Actually, the difference between the two-dimensional model 
and axis-symmentric model comes from the curvature of radius. However, we did not 
find a simple way to handle this barrier, and hence we still didnot know how to use our 
two-dimensional solutions to improve the existing technique on nanoindentation. In our 
neural network, the analysis results come from the axi-symmetric or three-dimensional 
modeling. 
  31
solutions obtained from the auxiliary system with a unit point force applied at the center 
of the circular plate can be found in (Hwu, 2011).  
 Substituting (2) and the fundamental solutions into the boundary integral equations 
with ( )ip ipc ξ  (the source point ξ  at the center of the plate is an internal point), 
( ) 0jq x  (no surface loads), and  * 0cN   (no corners), we see that the five boundary 
integral equations associated with five independent loading cases are all satisfied. In 
other words, the boundary integral equations derived in our study (see the report of 2nd 
year) are correct for this simple case.

In order to investigate the possible singular problem caused by the source point ξ  
located at the boundary or corners, in this example the auxiliary system is considered to 
be four independent unit point forces or moment applied at one of the corners (point A of 
Figure 6) , i.e., (i) 1ˆ 1f  , (ii) 2ˆ 1f  , (iii) 3ˆ 1f  , (iv) ˆ 1nm  . Here, the unit point moment

1ˆ ˆ 1/ 2ym m    and 2ˆ ˆ 1/ 2xm m   . The fundamental solutions in terms of

r are scaled by the LJ-parameter   and energies are scaled by the parameter  .  
In this study, the commercial software Material Studio (MS) was used to perform the 
simulation for molecular dynamic analysis. To study the crack problems of 
nanostructures, several different structures under tensile loading are considered. The 
COMPASS potentials and the Verlet algorithm are adopted in our simulation. Figure 7 is 
a model for the crack in copper, which was built by taking away three columns of atoms. 
Force was applied by moving the outer portion from 72.294A to 120.000A. NVT with 
temperature 298K, time step 1.0 fs and dynamic time 10.0 ps are the conditions set in this 
simulation. Figure 8 is the simulation results at 1.25ps.

This is the first step for our fracture analysis through molecular dynamics 
simulation. After we know more about the molecular dynamics simulation, we will try to 
develop an analytical model based on continuum mechanics as well as molecular 
mechanics. We hope that through this model the fracture toughness can be estimated. To 
ensure its validity, a simple experimental state such as the assumed tensile or pure shear 
state, will be considered first in our future study.

星級飯店價格低廉，即是一優質組合。(本次會議所在地點並非市中心，而是一豪華
莊園，確實讓與會者有絕佳之感受，只是公共交通不很方便，例如晚宴結束後已
10:30，已無任何公共交通工具可以載送與會者回市區旅館，經參與者反應後大會雖
已安排 Bus 接送，但卻無明確之告知，害的許多與會學者彼此互問，才順利搭上接
駁車回到市區旅館。) 
5. 會議論文之篩選非常重要，否則夾雜部份不理想之作品及發表者，徒然浪費

Abstract 
A combination of finite element modeling (FEM) and 
artificial neural network (ANN) is employed to estimate 
the surface pressure of flapping wings. The ANN training 
patterns are prepared by varying the surface pressure 
distributions and calculating their associated strains 
through FEM. Through the well-trained network, the 
surface pressure can be estimated instantly by the strains 
measured during flapping. The maximum flapping 
frequency that represents the strength of flapping wings is 
then predicted using maximum strain criterion, in which 
the critical strain was measured using the standard ASTM 
specimens. The relation between the flapping frequencies 
and strains is a curve fitted by the data measured under 
lower and safer flapping frequencies.

1 Introduction 
While fixed-wing flight has advanced rapidly over past 
100 years, nature’s flying animals, which have evolved 
over 150 million years, are still impressive. Based upon 
observation of flying animals such as birds and insects, 
most of the studies about flapping flight focus on wing 
motion and flexible airfoils [1]. Not too many researchers 
consider surface pressure and strength of flapping wings. 
To estimate the surface pressure and strength of flapping 
wings, in this paper a four-bar linkage design was selected 
as the mechanism for the wing flapping [2]. The wing 
frame was made by carbon/epoxy fiber reinforced 
composites and the wing skin by LD-PE plastic. Through 
the measurement of flapping strains for lower and safer 
flapping frequencies, the surface pressure and strength of 
flapping wings can then be predicted with the assist of 
finite element modeling and artificial neural network [3]. 
This prediction is then confirmed through the test of 
flapping to failure. 
 
2. Mechanical properties of flapping wings 
The flapping wings studied in this paper consist of wing 
frame made by carbon/epoxy fiber reinforced composites, 
and wing skin by thin LD-PE plastic. The flapping 
mechanism is a four-bar linkage driven by electric motor. 
To know the elastic properties and static strength of wing 
frame, a series 230mm×25mm specimens of carbon/epoxy 
fiber-reinforced composites are made and tested according 
to ASTM standards [4]. Through the standard procedure, 
the elastic properties and critical stress and strain of 
carbon/epoxy fiber reinforced composites used for the 
wing frame are measured to be 
 
.0194.0   MPa,8.874
,28.0   ,GPa8.0   ,GPa8   ,GPa45 121221

The LD-PE plastic for wing skin is an isotropic 
material whose Young’s modulus E, Poisson’s ratio ν and 
density ρ  are measured to be 
 
31.5GPa,    0.4,    947.8Kg/m .E ν ρ= = =           (2) 
 
3. Finite element modeling of flapping wings 
In this study, the finite element modeling was performed 
through the commercial finite element software ANSYS. 
The element SHELL91 was selected for the modeling of 
wing frame and skin whose mechanical properties have 
been measured and provided in (1) and (2). Boundary 
conditions are given by fixing all nodes at the wing root. 
The surface pressures are assumed to be in the form of two 
variables 2nd order polynomials, i.e., 
 
2 2( , ) ( / ) ( / ) ( / ) ( / )
             ( / ) ,
p x y a x L b y H c xy LH d x L
e y H f
= + + +
+ +  (3) 
 
in which L(=0.187m) and H(=0.066m) are the length and 
width of the wing. Mapped meshes are used for dividing 
elements and the element and node numbers are 
determined through convergence study. The internal and 
boundary stresses, strains and displacements of the wings 
can then be obtained by running ANSYS. 
 
 
Figure 1. Finite element model for flapping wings. 
 
Figure 1 shows the ANSYS model of the flapping wing. 
Since the frame of the flapping wing was made by 
carbon/epoxy fiber reinforced composites, in order to 
retain the continuous characteristics of fibers some layers 
were folded to make the required shape of wing frames. 
Therefore, each part of Figure 1 may contain composite

Generally speaking, there is no rule regarding the 
determination of neurons in the hidden layer, and the 
optimal number of neurons is concluded through test 
results. It is not necessary to have only one hidden layer. 
More hidden layers could simulate the highly nonlinear 
relationship between the input and output while sacrificing 
the speed of convergence. The convergence would be 
unstable when the hidden layers and neurons increase. In 
order to map the complex relation between input and 
output while maintaining a fairly simple architecture for 
stable convergence, back propagation neural network with 
two hidden layers is used in this paper. 
Consider a four-layer network, the relation between 
input p and output q can be expressed as [5] 
 
4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4( ( ( ( ) ) ) )f f f f= + + + +q W W W W p c c c c ,   (6) 
 
where f is the transfer function and iW  and ic , 
1, 2,3,4i =  are, respectively, the weight matrices and bias 
vectors. If the target of output is d, the mean square error E 
between target and output can be expressed as

E d q e
= =
= − = =∑ ∑ e e ,            (7) 
 
where mN  is the neuron number of the output layer, and e 
is a vector of network errors. To minimize the error 
function (7), several different optimization methods such 
as the steepest descent method and LM (Levenberg - 
Marquardt) method, etc., can be used to update the neuron 
weights. To put the input and output data in the specified 
range, normalization is usually made. Table 1 shows parts 
of the training patterns with input and output vectors stated 
in (5), which are obtained through the finite element 
modeling stated in Section 3. 
When the training patterns are well prepared, the 
artificial neural network can be trained by a proper 
optimization method. Since the architecture of artificial 
neural network includes the transfer function, the number 
of hidden layers, the number of neurons in each layer, and 
the convergence criterion, their selection becomes 
important for a well-trained network. In this paper, the 
output vector is specified in the range from zero to one 
through shifting and normalizing processes, and hence 
Log-Sigmoid function 1( ) (1 )xf x e− −= +  is selected to be 
the transfer function. As usual, two hidden layers with 
40×20 neuron numbers are tried in this study to find the 
most suitable network. The convergence criterion is set to 
be 610E −< . The training is performed by the commercial 
software Neural Network Toolbox built in MATLAB 6.5. 
After the training stage, several testing patterns also 
prepared through the finite element model are used to 
examine the wellness of the network.  
 
5. Measurement of flapping strains 
To estimate the flapping strength in nondestructive way, 
the flapping strains are measured under the lower and safer 
flapping frequencies. By the measured data of strains 
versus frequencies, the flapping strength may be estimated 
by extrapolating their relation to the failure frequency of 
flapping. Since the flapping mechanism designed for this 
test is a simple up and down flapping motion, the strain 
values at all wing points are periodical functions of time, 
and the strain at point A which is close to wing root is 
much more critical than those at points B and C. The 
locations of A, B and C are, respectively, (0.0025, -0.038), 
(0.046,-0.003), (0.0995, -0.033) where the origin is at the 
wing root (Figure 7). 
To predict the flapping strength, only the largest strain 
in each flapping cycle is concerned in constructing the 
relationship between the flapping frequencies and 
measured flapping strains. Figure 8 is an illustrative result 
for flapping frequencies ω  versus strains ε  at the root 
of the wing, in which the small circle “ D ” denotes the 
average of the largest strains of all flapping cycles, and the 
horizontal bars above and below the small circle stand for 
the variation of largest strains from different flapping 
cycles. To best fit a curve for the data of 
strains-frequencies shown in Figure 8, the least of square 
error method was used. A straight line was assumed by

By using the general solutions given in Eq. 2, the near tip solutions satisfying boundary conditions 
Eq. 6 have been obtained in [3]. In that study, it concludes that the consideration of thermal effects 
will not influence the stress singularity but will induce heat flux singularity if the singularity of the 
temperature field is not permissible. Therefore, to consider the orders of stress singularity and their 
associated intensity factors, only the near tip solutions under mechanical loading (without 
consideration of the thermal effects) are employed in our following studies. They are [4]:

with the singular order 2   and ˆ 0T  . 
The difference between the modified H-integral Eq. 12 and the H-integral for pure mechanical 
loading problem is the additional area integral in the second term of Eq. 12 whose complementary 
strain iˆj  has high singularity behavior as 2r  . This term will cause tremendous numerical error, and 
hence should be treated with special attention [16]. By using the near tip solutions Eq. 8, it has been 
proved that the stress intensity factor k is related to the H-integral by [4]

Numerical Examples 
Firstly, to validate the proposed approach, a center crack in an isotropic square plate under pure mode 
I (or mode II) thermal loading will be analyzed to compare our numerical results with the solutions 
available in the literatures. Then, an example discussing the effect of corner angle on the orders of 
stress singularity and stress intensity factors will be investigated. 
Example 1: A center crack in an isotropic plate under mode I thermal loading. This example 
had been done in [17-19]. In Fig.2a, a crack is embedded in a square isotropic plate whose Young’s 
modulus, Poisson’s ratio, coefficient of thermal expansion, and heat conduction coefficient are 
1MPaE  , 0.3  , 4 110 C    , 1W / m Ck   , respectively. The half crack length a=4mm and 
the half plate width w=10a. The crack surfaces are subjected to the constant temperature 0 CinT   , 
while all the outer edges of the plate are maintained at the temperature 100 CoutT   . Table 1 shows 
the comparison of our results with those presented in the literature and reveals good agreement 
among our results and all the reference solutions. The path-independent property of H-integral is 
checked numerically via three circular paths with different radii, r.  
Example 2: A center crack in an isotropic plate under mode II thermal loading. The analytical 
solutions of this example has been provided in [7]. Fig. 2b displays a center crack in an isotropic 
square plate whose Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio, coefficient of thermal expansion, and heat 
conduction coefficient are 218.4GPaE  , 0.3  , 6 116.7 10 C     , 1W / m Ck   , respectively. 
The half crack length a=1mm and the ratio w/a =30 is used to simulate an infinite domain. The crack 
surfaces and both of the two vertical edges of the plate are all insulated (i.e. no heat flux across these 
edges). The top and bottom edges of this plate are, respectively, maintained at the constant 
temperatures 12.9938 CupT    and 12.9938 ClowT    . Comparison between the present results and 
the reference solutions is also listed in Table 1. In this table, the data show that our results agree well 
with the analytical solution and the path-independent property of H-integral indeed holds.  
Example 3: An edge corner in an isotropic plate under thermal and mechanical loadings. The 
geometrcal data, boundary conditions, and loadings used in this example are shown in Fig. 3. Note 
that the corner surfaces are also under insulated condition which is not shown in Fig. 3. The material 
properties of this isotropic plate are the same as those of example 2. The mode II thermal loading used 
in example 2 and an extra mechanical tensile stress 0 1MPa   are applied on the two horizontal 
edges of the plate. The results of the first three orders of stress singularity for the edge corners ranging 
from 0    to 80    are shown in Fig. 4a, whereas Fig.4b shows the results of the stress intensity 
factors associated with the most critical singular order c . Without caring the difference of the units, 
from Fig. 4b we see that both of the absolute values of  IK  and IIK  increase monotonically with 
increaing  . Also, the numerical data of IK  and IIK  for the crack whose 0    agree with the

Summary 
An efficient approach to calculate the orders of stress singularity and stress intensity factors of 
interface corners between two dissimilar anisotropic elastic materials under thermal loading is 
proposed in this paper. A modified H-integral accounting for the thermal effects is suggested to 
calculate the stress intensity factors. Through the numerical examples shown in this paper, the 
correctness and validity of this modified H-integral are verified for the cases of cracks and corners.

Abstract 
Due to the inclusion of time as an independent variable to describe the mechanical behavior of viscoelastic materials, 
the available analytical solutions have been obtained only for a few simplified problems. To study the mechanical 
behavior of viscoelastic solids, the numerical approaches such as finite element method (FEM) and boundary element 
method (BEM) are normally needed. The main advantages of BEM are the reduction of the problem dimension by 
one and the exact satisfaction of certain boundary conditions for particular problems if their associated fundamental 
solutions are embedded in boundary element formulation. Through the use of correspondence principle, the 
viscoelastic solids can be effectively treated in Laplace domain. To take advantage of the available fundamental 
solutions for the defects in anisotropic elastic materials, in this paper we use the transformed BEM to treat the 
problems of viscoelastic solids containing defects such as holes, cracks, or inclusions. By using the subregion 
technique, the problems with simultaneous existence of multiple holes, cracks, and inclusions can also be treated. The 
main feature of this proposed method is that no meshes are needed along the boundary of defects and the boundary 
conditions are satisfied exactly, which means that the present approach should be more efficient and correct.

eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which can be determined by the standard material eigenrelations [7].  
3. Transformed boundary element method 
By using the correspondence principle, the boundary integral equations in Laplace domain of a linear 
viscoelastic body are equivalent to those of linear elastic body, i.e., 
* *( ) ( , ) [ ( , , ) ( , ) ( , , ) ( , )] ( ),   , 1, 2,3,ij j ij j ij jc u s u s t s t s u s d i jξ ξ ξ x x ξ x x x                                             (6) 
where   denotes the boundary of the elastic solid; ( , )ju sx  and ( , )jt sx  are the Laplace transform of the 
displacements and surface tractions along the boundaries; ( )ijc ξ  are the free term coefficients dependent 
on the location of ξ ; * ( , , )iju sξ x  and * ( , , )ijt sξ x  are the fundamental solutions of the corresponding 
anisotropic elastic problem, which can be found in [7] for the problems of interfaces, holes, cracks and 
inclusions. 
After getting the fundamental solutions from the corresponding elastic problems, the unknowns 
remained in the boundary integral equations (6) are ju
  and jt

 over the boundary  . In boundary element 
formulation, the boundary   is approximated by a series of elements, and the points x, displacements ju  
and tractions jt

 on the boundary are approximated by the nodal points, nodal displacement and nodal 
traction through suitable interpolation functions. In this study, the linear variation within each element is 
assumed for the boundary points, and the displacements and tractions in Laplace transform domain. Thus, 
by following the standard procedure for boundary element formulation [12], the Laplace transform of the 
displacements and tractions of the boundary nodes can be obtained by solving a system of linear algebraic 
equations. Once all the Laplace transform of the displacements and tractions on the boundary are 
determined, the values of the internal stresses and displacements in Laplace domain can be calculated by 
using the boundary integral equations (6) again, where ( )ij ijc ξ  . After getting the displacements iu  and 
stresses ij  in Laplace transform domain through the transformed boundary elements, their associated 
solutions in real time domain can then be determined by numerical inversion of Laplace transform, such 
as Schapery method [13], and Stehfest method [14]. To treat the problems of anisotropic viscoelastic 
bodies containing multiple interfaces, holes, cracks, and/or inclusions, the subregion technique 
considering the compatibility and equilibrium conditions between the interfaces of subregions is 
employed in this study [8]. 
4. Numerical examples 
The special feature of the BEM proposed in this paper is that no meshes are needed along the 
boundaries of interfaces, holes, cracks and inclusions, and the meshes along the remaining boundaries can 
be made by relatively rough discretization. To show this special feature, several examples considering 
defects of viscoelastic solids have been illustrated in our recent study [8]. Here, we like to explore more

in (9), we see that at initial state the properties of matrix and inclusion are the same, and the entire solid 
behaves like a homogeneous material. Thus, the solutions shown in Figures 2(b) and 2(c) can be checked 
by 0/ 1    at 0    with 0    and at 45    with 45    for the initial state ( 0t  ). From 
these two figures, it is interesting to observe that the hoop stresses of certain points around the inclusion 
do not change in time.

An Analytical Molecular Mechanics Model for Mechanical 
Properties of General Elastic Solids

ABSTRACT 
Usually the mechanical properties of general elastic solids are determined by 
performing standard tests in the laboratory. When the solids are designable or are 
made of constituent materials in micro or nano scale that are not easy to test, a 
suitable model for the estimation of mechanical properties becomes important. To 
achieve this goal, several different approaches have been proposed in the literature 
such as the micromechanics approach for heterogeneous composite materials, the 
molecular dynamics approach for nanomaterials, and the approaches combining the 
concepts of continuum mechanics and molecular dynamics. If the nanomaterials are 
considered, most of the proposed approaches reply on the numerical simulation of 
molecular dynamics or finite element modeling. Very few of them consider the 
analytical modeling. In this paper, an analytical model based on continuum mechanics 
as well as molecular mechanics is proposed to estimate the mechanical properties of 
general elastic solids which may be in macro or micro or nano scale.  
Through the as made experimental state such as the assumed tensile or pure shear 
state, the deformed position of each atom of the test specimen can be determined by 
the theory of elasticity. With the knowledge of the undeformed and deformed 
positions of each atom, the bond distance and bond angles between atoms which are 
essential for the calculation of potential energy in molecular mechanics can be 
obtained. By treating this potential energy as the strain energy of deformed solids, the 
mechanical properties can then be determined through the differentiation of strain 
energy with respect to strains. Verification of the concept and derivation procedure 
proposed in this paper is then made by an example whose analytical solution has been 
provided in the literature such as the Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio for a 
single-walled carbon nanotube. Furthermore, experimental results measured by 
atomic force microscopy and numerical results simulated by molecular dynamics or 
finite element modeling will all be compared to see the appropriateness of the present 
analytical model. The cases of general elastic solids will then be done in our future 
work. 
  
Author's personal copy
piezoelectric effects, very few research efforts have been focused on this study. Suo et al. (1992) mentioned the structures of
the inverse of impedance matrix iAB1 and provided explicit forms for some simple cases. Ting (1996) discussed the struc-
tures of N1 and N3 for general piezoelectric materials without detailed expressions. Soh et al. (2001) and Liou and Sung
(2007) provided explicit expressions of A, B, L, S and H for transversely isotropic piezoelectric materials whose poling axis
coincides with x2-axis and monoclinic piezoelectric materials, respectively. In this paper, solutions are provided for general
piezoelectric materials covering all the possible two-dimensional states such as generalized plane strain/short or open cir-
cuit, and generalized plane stress/short or open circuit. The explicit expressions for A, B and N given in this paper are valid for
all possible piezoelectric anisotropic materials. While for L, S and H, standard procedure can be applied for all possible pie-
zoelectric anisotropic materials and the explicit expressions are given only for two special examples: piezoelectric ceramics
poling in two different axes.
2. Constitutive laws for piezoelectric materials in three-dimensional states
For an anisotropic and linearly electro-elastic solid, the constitutive relation between elastic ﬁeld tensors (stresses rij and
strains eij) and electric ﬁeld vectors (electric displacements or called induction Dj and electric ﬁeld Ej) can be represented by
four equally important systems of piezoeffect equations. In tensor notation, they can be written as (Rogacheva, 1994).
rij ¼ CEijklekl  ekijEk;
Dj ¼ ejklekl þ xejkEk;
(
eij ¼ SEijklrkl þ dkijEk;
Dj ¼ djklrkl þ xrjkEk;
(
rij ¼ CDijklekl  hkijDk;
Ej ¼ hjklekl þ bejkDk;
(
eij ¼ SDijklrkl þ gkijDk;
Ej ¼ gjklrkl þ brjkDk;
(
i; j; k; l ¼ 1;2;3; ð2:1Þ
where SEijkl and S
D
ijkl are elastic compliances at constant electric ﬁeld and induction; C
E
ijkl and C
D
ijkl are elastic stiffnesses at con-
stant electric ﬁeld and induction; xejk;x
r

jk; b
r
jk are dielectric permittivities and non-permittivities at constant strains
and stresses; dkij; ekij; gkij and hkij are piezoelectric strain/charge, stress/charge, strain/voltage, stress/voltage tensors, respec-
tively. Consideration of the symmetry of stresses and strains, and the path-independency of elastic strain energy, these con-
stants have the following symmetry properties
CEijkl ¼ CEjikl ¼ CEklij; ekij ¼ ekji; xejk ¼ xekj;
SEijkl ¼ SEjikl ¼ SEklij; dkij ¼ dkji; xrjk ¼ xrkj;
CDijkl ¼ CDjikl ¼ CDklij; hkij ¼ hkji; bejk ¼ bekj;
SDijkl ¼ SDjikl ¼ SDklij; gkij ¼ gkji; brjk ¼ brkj:
ð2:2Þ
To express the constitutive laws in matrix form, the contracted notation assigning 11 to 1, 22 to 2, 33 to 3, 23 or 32 to 4, 13
or 31 to 5, 12 or 21 to 6, 14 or 41 to 7, 24 or 42 to 8, 34 or 43 to 9 are usually used in engineering expressions. With this
assignment and the symmetry properties Eq. (2.2), certain transformations need add a factor of 2 or 4. They are
2Sijkl ¼ Spq; if either p or q > 3;
4Sijkl ¼ Spq; if both p and q > 3;
2eij ¼ ep; 2dkij ¼ dkp; 2gkij ¼ gkp; if p > 3:

4. Extended Stroh formalism for piezoelectric anisotropic elasticity
For two-dimensional linear anisotropic elasticity, there are two major complex variable formalisms in the literature. One
is Lekhnitskii formalism (Lekhnitskii, 1963) which starts with the equilibrated stress functions followed by constitutive laws,
strain-displacement relations and compatibility equations; the other is Stroh formalism (Stroh, 1958) which starts with the
compatible displacements followed by strain-displacement relations, constitutive laws and equilibrium equations. With this
understanding, to develop the extended Stroh formalism for piezoelectric anisotropic elasticity the most appropriate consti-
tutive relation is the ﬁrst equation set of Eq. (2.1). While for the extended Lekhnitksii formalism the most appropriate con-
stitutive relation is the last equation set of Eq. (2.1). Thus, to describe the extended Stroh formalism for piezoelectric
anisotropic elasticity, it is better to write the basic equations as

Note that because the material eigenvalues lk obtained from the eigen-relation (4.7) cannot be real if the strain energy is
positive (Suo et al., 1992; Ting, 1996), lk occurs as four pairs of complex conjugates. In the general solution (4.5), the material
eigenvalues lk and material eigenvectors ak;bk have been arranged to be lkþ4 ¼ lk, ImðlkÞ > 0, and akþ4 ¼ ak;bkþ4 ¼ bk,
k ¼ 1;2;3;4 where an overbar denotes the complex conjugate and Im stands for the imaginary part. Moreover, in the general
solution (4.5), the material eigenvalues are assumed to be distinct and their associated eigenvectors are independent each
other. For the cases that the material eigenvalues are repeated so that their associated eigenvectors are not independent each
other, the general solution (4.5) should be modiﬁed (Ting, 1996) or one may introduce a small perturbation in the values of
material properties to avoid the problem of degeneracy (Hwu and Yen, 1991).
From the above discussions we know that the fundamental matrix N and its associated eigenvector n ¼ ða;bÞ play impor-
tant roles in Stroh formalism. Due to their importance, several works have been done to get their explicit expressions for
pure anisotropic elastic materials (Ting, 1996). Since ak;bk are the right eigenvectors of the fundamental matrix N, to have
unique values of ak;bk normalization is necessary. Following is the orthogonality relation for the material eigenvector matri-
ces A and B of anisotropic materials (Ting, 1996), which can also be extended to the piezoelectric anisotropic materials.

From the relations (4.10), it has been observed that the following three matrices S, H and L are real, which appear often in
the ﬁnal solutions to two-dimensional anisotropic elasticity problems,
S ¼ ið2ABT  IÞ; H ¼ 2iAAT ; L ¼ 2iBBT : ð4:11Þ
These three real matrices have also been proved to be the average values of N1ðhÞ;N2ðhÞ and N3ðhÞ over the interval
h ¼ ð0; pÞ (Barnett and Lothe, 1973), and hence are usually called Barnett–Lothe tensors.
5. Explicit expressions for fundamental matrix N
Although the fundamental matrix N is deﬁned clearly in (4.7b, 4.7c), their calculation involves the matrix inversion.
Therefore, if we do not pay special attention to get their explicit expressions, their results from pure numerical calculation
can only provide their numerical values which are not appropriate for the understanding of the physical meaning of the ana-
lytical solutions found by using the extended Stroh formalism. Even it is possible to ﬁnd the explicit expressions by using the
symbolic computational software such as Mathematica, ignorant of the relations among the components may lead to com-
plicated expressions. Although it has been indicated by Ting (1996) that certain elements of N1 and N3 are zero for piezo-
electric materials, no explicit expressions for Ni have been published in the literature. In this section, we will follow the
steps described in (Ting, 1996) for pure anisotropic materials to get the explicit expressions of Ni for piezoelectric materials.
In order to ﬁnd the explicit expressions of Ni, we ﬁrst re-organize (4.7c) into the following compact matrix form

Since (6.4) is a system of homogeneous partial differential equations in two independent variables x1 and x2. A general
solution for /i depends on one complex variable that is a linear combination of x1 and x2, which is also applicable for ui
through (6.2a). Without loss of generality the coefﬁcient of x1 is usually selected to be unity, i.e., z ¼ x1 þ lx2. By comparison
with the general solutions shown in (4.5a), we may now let
ui ¼ aif ðzÞ; /i ¼ bif ðzÞ; ð6:5Þ

Eq. (6.6a) is a linear algebraic system of equations with four unknowns and three equations. To solve the unknown vector
b, we need one more relation. From (4.6) we see that /i; i ¼ 1;2;3;4, are not independent each other because of the symme-
try of stress r12 ¼ r21, which will lead to

If we consider the two-dimensional state of generalized plane strain and short circuit (e3 ¼ 0 and E3 ¼ 0Þ, the explicit
expressions of the eigenvectors a and b shown in (6.12) and (6.15) are written in terms of bS0Dij ; g^0ij; b^0rij . Therefore, to get the
explicit expressions for the material eigenvector matrices A and B, the ﬁrst thing we need to do is ﬁnding the inverse relation
of (6.17), which gives us
bS0D11 ¼ bS0D22 ¼ CE11ðCE11Þ2ðCE12Þ2 ; bS0D12 ¼ bS0D21 ¼ CE12ðCE11Þ2ðCE12Þ2 ;bS0D44 ¼ bS0D55 ¼ xe11e215þxe11CE44 ; bS0D66 ¼ 2CE11CE12 ;bS0D48 ¼ g^024 ¼ bS0D57 ¼ g^015 ¼ e15e215þxe11CE44 ¼ g;
bS0D77 ¼ b^0r11 ¼ bS0D88 ¼ b^022 ¼ CE44e215þxe11CE44 ¼ b;
ð6:18aÞ
and all the other constants are zero, i.e.,bS0D14 ¼ bS0D15 ¼ bS0D16 ¼ bS0D17 ¼ bS0D18 ¼ bS0D24 ¼ bS0D25 ¼ bS0D26 ¼ bS0D27 ¼ bS0D28
¼ bS0D45 ¼ bS0D46 ¼ bS0D47 ¼ bS0D56 ¼ bS0D58 ¼ bS0D67 ¼ bS0D68 ¼ bS0D78 ¼ 0: ð6:18bÞ
Substituting (6.18a, 6.18b) into (6.10b), we get
‘2 ¼ bS0D44ðl2 þ 1Þ; ‘4 ¼ bS0D11ðl2 þ 1Þ2; m2 ¼ gðl2 þ 1Þ; q2 ¼ bðl2 þ 1Þ;
‘3 ¼ m3 ¼ 0:
ð6:19Þ
With this result, the characteristic Eq. (6.11) gives us the material eigenvalues with positive imaginary part,
lk; k ¼ 1;2;3;4, as
l1 ¼ l2 ¼ l3 ¼ l4 ¼ i: ð6:20Þ
With the repeated eigenvalues obtained in (6.20), we see that the coefﬁcient matrix of b1 of (6.10a) is identical to zero
and all the explicit expressions shown in (6.12a) provide trivial solution, i.e., b=0. As we explain in the paragraph following
(6.12b), under this condition we may take any three independent vectors of b1 as the eigenvectors and the relation
lb2 ¼ b1 should be employed to complete the eigenvector b. With this understanding, the eigenvector matrix B can be
written as
B ¼
c1l1 c2l2 0 0
c1 c2 0 0
0 0 c3 0
0 0 0 c4
26664

Note that in the above all four eigenvectors are independent each other depending on the assumption that l1 6¼ l2. How-
ever, from (6.20) we know that it is not true since all the eigenvalues are the same. Therefore, the material eigenvector ma-
trix B for this special case does not exist owing to the fact that no enough independent eigenvectors exist for the repeated
eigenvalues. This is the so called degenerate materials. For this special kind of materials, the general solution shown in (4.5) is
not valid and should be modiﬁed. A modiﬁed formalism for degenerate materials has been proposed in (Ting and Hwu, 1988;
Ting, 1996) for two-dimensional anisotropic elasticity, which may also be applied to the piezoelectric problems. Even (6.21)
is not valid for the present case when l1 ¼ l2 ¼ i. In many applications, it is very useful by treating l1 ¼ i and l2 ¼ iþ e
where e is a small perturbed value. Successful application of (6.21) can be seen in the next section when we derive the ex-
plicit expressions of Barnett–Lothe tensors L, S, and H.

‘2ð‘4q2 m23Þ ¼ 0: ð6:26Þ
Let l1 be the root of ‘2 ¼ 0 and l2; l3; l4 be the roots of ‘4q2 m23 ¼ 0, whose imaginary parts are positive. Since
‘4q2 m23 ¼ 0 is a 3rd order polynomial of l2 whose coefﬁcients are all real and l cannot be real, the most general expressions
for the roots of l2 are one pair of complex conjugates and one real. And hence, we may let
l1 ¼ i

The material eigenvector matrix B can then be constructed through (6.12) with the values given in (6.25). Its ﬁnal sim-
pliﬁed expression is
B ¼

c1 0 0 0

where
gk ¼
‘4ðlkÞ
m3ðlkÞ
¼ m3ðlkÞ
q2ðlkÞ
; k ¼ 2;3;4: ð6:28bÞ
Note that through (6.25), (6.27) and (6.28b) we see that some relations exist for lk and gk:
l3 ¼ l2; g3 ¼ g2; l4 ¼ l4; g4 ¼ g4: ð6:29Þ
By the way similar to Example 1, the material eigenvector matrix A can then be written as
A ¼
0 c2a12 c3a13 c4a14
0 c2a22 c3a23 c4a24
c1bS0D44=l1 0 0 0

a4k ¼ ðg^016  b^0r11gkÞlk; k ¼ 2;3;4:
ð6:30bÞ
The scaling factors ck; k ¼ 1;2;3;4 shown in (6.28) and (6.30) can then be determined by the orthogonality relation
(4.10a), or obtained directly from (6.16).
7. Explicit expressions for Barnett–Lothe tensors S, H and L
In two-dimensional problems, three real matrices S, H and L deﬁned in Eq. (4.11) appear frequently in the ﬁnal real form
solutions. Although this deﬁnition is not valid for degenerate materials whose material eigenvector matrices A and B may
not exist, such as Example 1 shown in the last section, Barnett and Lothe (1973) devised an integral formalism to compute
these matrices directly from the elastic stiffnesses. Their integral formalism shows that
S ¼ 1
p
Z p
0
N1ðhÞdh; H ¼ 1p
Z p
0
N2ðhÞdh; L ¼ 1p
Z p
0
N3ðhÞdh; ð7:1Þ
which means that S, H and L are, respectively, the average values of N1ðhÞ, N2ðhÞ and N3ðhÞ. By this integral formal-
ism, the problems associated with degenerate materials disappear. Hence, S, H and L sometimes are called Barnett–
Lothe tensors. Due to the importance of S, H and L, it is always desirable to have their explicit expressions. Although
the integral formalism (7.1) has its advantage to avoid the degenerate problems, it is not convenient for the calcula-
tion. If we have the explicit expressions of A and B, it seems that a direct substitution by the deﬁnition (4.11) is a
good approach. However, the presence of the normalization factors ck for the eigenvector matrices A and B would lead
the direct substitution to a unwieldy algebraic calculation. An alternative approach by employing AB1 is suggested by
Ting (Ting, 1996). In the following, we will follow his steps to ﬁnd the explicit expressions of S, H and L for the two
examples discussed in the last section.
Knowing that AB1 ¼ ðABTÞðBBTÞ1 and using the deﬁnitions given in (4.11), we have
AB1 ¼ ðSL1 þ iL1Þ: ð7:2Þ
When A is multiplied by B1, it is seen that the normalization factors cancel each other, which may prevent the unwieldy
results by direct substitution into the deﬁnitions given in (4.11). Eq. (7.2) shows that L and S can be obtained, respectively,
from the imaginary part and real part of AB1 by

It can be proved that the explicit solutions shown in Eqs. (7.7), (7.8) agree with those presented by Soh et al. (2001),
although they are different in outward appearance. Note that one typing error occurs in eqn. (40b) of (Soh et al., 2001), in
which Im of the ﬁrst term should be corrected as Re.
8. Conclusions
Four types of constitutive laws for piezoelectric materials in three-dimensional state are brieﬂy reviewed in this paper.
Four different two-dimensional states are discussed to get the reduced constitutive laws for two-dimensional problems.
Even the extended Stroh formalism for piezoelectric anisotropic elasticity was derived under one of the four two-dimen-
sional states: the generalized plane strain and short circuit condition, by suitable replacement of the material constants it
can still be applied to the other two-dimensional states. With this understanding, in this paper only the explicit expressions
for the state of generalized plane strain and short circuit are presented. The explicit expressions for the fundamental matrix
N1;N2 and N3, and material eigenvectors a and b are presented in (5.4) and (6.12) and (6.15) for all possible piezoelectric
anisotropic materials. Standard procedure for getting the explicit expressions of Barnett–Lothe tensors L, S and H is shown
in (7.2)–(7.4). Two typical examples for piezoelectric ceramics poling in two different axes, x3-axis or x2-axis, are shown in
Sections 6 and 7 for getting their explicit expressions of A, B, L, S and H.

extension also applies for the near tip solutions and the stress/electric intensity factors (Hwu and Kuo, 2007). The
only difference is the content and dimension of the matrix which is now enlarged to include the piezoelectric prop-
erties. In addition to this simple extension, in this section we also extend the deﬁnition of stress/electric intensity
factors to corner problems. Usually for the problems of cracks, interface cracks or interface corners, it is quite appar-
ent to choose the surface parallel to cracks or interfaces to deﬁne the intensity factors of stresses. However, for the
general corners all directions seem to be indifferent. If we choose an arbitrary surface to deﬁne the stress/electric
intensity factors we may have the problems searching for the principal stress/electric intensity factors. This extension
will then allow us to do this kind of search and may become a valuable fracture parameter for predicting the corner/
crack propagating direction.
To show the connection between the corners/interface corners and cracks/interface cracks, the singular characteristics
of cracks/interface cracks is studied in Section 4 from the viewpoint of multi-wedges simply by selecting proper wedge
angles for a single wedge and a bi-wedge. From this approach, the near tip solutions are reduced from those of piezo-
electric multi-wedges. With the obtained near tip solutions, the crack opening displacement/electric potential, energy
release rate and mechanical energy release rate proposed by Park and Sun (1995) are all written in terms of the
stress/electric intensity factors explicitly to help the researchers observe more clearly the piezoeffects on cracks/interface
cracks.
Several classical and typical but yet mostly unsolved crack problems for piezoelectric materials are presented in Sec-
tion 5. Due to the special feature of Stroh formalism, the solutions in matrix form all keep the same form as those of the
corresponding anisotropic problems. However, to see more clearly about the piezoeffects on crack problems, it is always
interested to ﬁnd the solutions in component form. With the help of explicit expressions obtained recently for some
important matrices involved in the extended Stroh formalism (Hwu, 2008), in this section the explicit solutions of
stress/electric intensity factors are also presented in component form for two typical piezoelectric ceramics: one is pol-
ing in x3-axis and the other is poling in x2-axis. If one is interested in the effects of different electric crack–face boundary
conditions such as permeable, impermeable and partially permeable crack–face boundaries, the direct correspondence
between anisotropic and piezoelectric materials may not work and their matrix form solution may also be different.
Thus, to have a detailed understanding about the electric crack–face boundary effects such as those discussed in (Gao
and Fan, 1999; Boem and Atluri, 2002; Gao et al., 2004; Wang and Mai, 2004; Li and Chen, 2007), additional works start-
ing from the revision of boundary conditions should be done by the way similar to that used for the derivation of the
associated anisotropic problems.
2. Electromechanical analysis
2.1. Basic equations
In a ﬁxed rectangular coordinate system xi, i=1, 2, 3, let ui, rij, eij, Dj and Ek be, respectively, the displacement, stress, strain,
electric displacement (or called induction) and electric ﬁeld. The constitutive laws, strain-displacement equations, the equi-
librium equations and the electrostatic equation for piezoelectric anisotropic elasticity are (Rogacheva, 1994)
rij ¼ CEijklekl  ekijEk;
Dj ¼ ejklekl þxejkEk;
(
eij ¼ 12 ðui;j þ uj;iÞ;
rij;j ¼ 0;
Di;i ¼ 0;

i; j; k; s ¼ 1;2;3; ð2:1Þ
where repeated indices imply summation, a comma stands for differentiation and CEijkl; ekij and xejk are, respectively, the elas-
tic stiffness tensor at constant electric ﬁeld, piezoelectric stress tensor and dielectric permittivity tensor at constant strain.
These tensors have the following symmetry properties
CEijkl ¼ CEjikl ¼ CEklij; ekij ¼ ekji; xejk ¼ xekj: ð2:2Þ
By letting
Dj ¼ r4j; Ej ¼ u4;j ¼ 2e4j; j ¼ 1;2;3;
Cijkl ¼ CEijkl; i; j; k; l ¼ 1;2;3;
Cij4l ¼ elij; i; j; l ¼ 1;2;3;
C4jkl ¼ ejkl; j; k; l ¼ 1;2;3;
C4j4l ¼ xejl; j; l ¼ 1;2;3;
ð2:3Þ
the basic equations (2.1) can be rewritten in an expanded tensor notation as
rIJ ¼ CIJKLeKL; eIJ ¼ 12 ðuI;J þ uJ;IÞ; rIJ;J ¼ 0; I; J;K; L ¼ 1;2;3;4; ð2:4Þ
where expanded elastic stiffness tensor CIJKL has the following symmetry property
CIJKL ¼ CJIKL ¼ CKLIJ ¼ CIJLK : ð2:5Þ
C. Hwu, T. Ikeda / International Journal of Solids and Structures 45 (2008) 5744–5764 5745
where nj is the unit normal to the surface boundary; t1, t2, t3 are the components of surface traction vector and t4 (=Dn) is the
electric displacement on the normal direction of the surface. If s is the arc length measured along a curved boundary, using
the Cauchy’s formula and the relation given in (2.7), we may obtain a useful formula:
t ¼ o/
os
: ð2:11Þ
To keep this relation in correct sign the tangential direction s has to be chosen such that when one faces the direc-
tion of increasing s the material lies on the right side. Otherwise, a negative sign should be put on either side of the
equation.
From (2.11), we have t = /,r for a radial line surface and t = /,h/r for a circular surface, and hence the stresses and electric
displacement in polar coordinate can also be calculated from the generalized stress function vector / by
th ¼ /;r; tr ¼ /;h=r;
rhh ¼ nT/;r ; rrr ¼ sT/;h=r; rrh ¼ sT/;r ¼ nT/;h=r;
rh3 ¼ iT3/;r ; rr3 ¼ iT3/;h=r;
Dh ¼ iT4/;r ; Dr ¼ iT4/;h=r;
ð2:12aÞ
where
sT ¼ ðcos h; sin h;0;0Þ; nT ¼ ð sin h; cos h; 0;0Þ;
iT3 ¼ ð0;0;1;0Þ; iT4 ¼ ð0;0;0;1Þ;
ð2:12bÞ
and the angle h is directed counterclockwise from the positive x1-axis to the direction of s.
The counterpart of t is the generalized displacement vector u shown in (2.6b)1 in which u1, u2, u3 are the displacement com-
ponents and u4 deﬁned in (2.3)2 is the electric potential. Understanding the physical meaning of the generalized surface trac-
tion vector t and generalized displacement vector u, and using the relation (2.11), several commonly encountered boundary
conditions can be written as follows.
Continuity condition:
u1 ¼ u2;/1 ¼ /2 along the interface: ð2:13aÞ
Mechanically free and electrically open:
/ ¼ 0 along the free surface: ð2:13bÞ
Mechanically clamped and electrically closed:
u ¼ 0 along the clamped surface: ð2:13cÞ
Point force ðp^1; p^2; p^3Þ and point charge p^4 ¼ q^:I
C
d/ ¼ p^;
I

du ¼ 0 for any close curve C enclosing the loading point: ð2:13dÞ
2.4. Some explicit expressions
As mentioned above, the explicit expressions for A and B of piezoelectric materials have been obtained in our recent stud-
ies. In addition, another three important real matrices S, H and L deﬁned by
S ¼ ið2ABT  IÞ; H ¼ 2iAAT; L ¼ 2iBBT; ð2:14Þ
where i ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
1
p
, have also been obtained explicitly for piezoelectric materials. For those who are interested in the explicit
expressions of A, B, S, H and L, please refer to Hwu (2008) for detailed expressions. For the convenience of later discussions,
the explicit expressions of the other important matricesM, D andW which will be used in this paper are shown below.M is
the impedance matrix, and D and W are, respectively, the real and imaginary parts of the bimaterial matrixM*. They are de-
ﬁned as
M ¼ iBA1; M ¼M11 þM12 ¼ iðA1B11  A2B12 Þ ¼ D iW: ð2:15Þ
Through (2.14) it can be shown that M1, D and W are related to S and L1 by
M1 ¼ L1  iSL1; D ¼ L11 þ L12 ; W ¼ S1L11  S2L12 : ð2:16Þ
Followings are the explicit expressions of M1, D and W for two typical piezoelectric ceramics, which are obtained by
using the expressions of S and L given in (Hwu, 2008).

Since the mathematical form of the general solution (2.6), the boundary conditions (3.2), (3.3), and all the related equa-
tions of the present problems are exactly the same as the corresponding pure anisotropic multi-wedge problems, the solu-
tions for the present problem should also preserve the same mathematical form as the solutions for the corresponding pure
anisotropic multi-wedge problems. The only difference is the contents and dimensions of the matrices/vectors, which have
all been clearly deﬁned in the extended Stroh formalism. With this understanding, we can now write down the solutions for
the present problem by just referring to those published in the literature for the pure anisotropic multi-wedge problems
(Hwu et al., 2003; Hwu and Lee, 2004).
3.1. Orders of stress/electric singularity
The orders of stress/electric singularity of the piezoelectric multi-wedges can be determined by the eigenrelations men-
tioned later in (3.10), which provide the following relations for the singular orders:
bonded : jjKe  Ijj ¼ 0;
free—free : Kð3Þe
  ¼ 0; fixed—fixed : Kð2Þe  ¼ 0;

where I is a 8  8 unit matrix and N(a) is the generalized fundamental matrix of N of (2.8). It has been proved that the key
matrix is related to the material eigenvalues la and eigenvector matrices A and B by (Hwu et al., 2003)

nuity (mechanical and electrical) conditions are assumed on the other interface. Most of these results agree with those pre-
sented in (Xu and Rajapakse, 2000). Only two small discrepancies occur in these comparisons. One is the missing of smallest
singular orders in their results shown for the right angle free–ﬁxed PZT-4 wedge and the PZT-4/PZT-5 bi-wedges, which are
now shown in the present results, i.e., d = 0.0576 added in Table 1 and d1 added in Fig. 3. The other is the discrepancy of the
singular order d2 shown in Fig. 3 for the PZT-4/PZT-5 bi-wedges, in which the trend shown here seems more compatible with
the other singular orders.
3.2. Near tip solutions
The displacements, stresses, electric ﬁelds and electric displacements near the apex of piezoelectric multi-wedges can be
obtained from the following solutions which sometimes are called eigenfunctions:

in which (r,h) is the polar coordinate with origin located on the wedge apex; uk(r,h) is a 4  1 vector containing three dis-
placement components and one electric potential of the kth wedge; /k(r,h) is a 4  1 vector containing three stress functions
and one potential of electric displacement of the kth wedge; (Ke)k1 is a 8  8 matrix deﬁned by

From (3.12a)with h = 0,we see that the coefﬁcient h(1  dR + iea)ic can be thought as the intensity of singularity of the stres-
ses (rrh,rhh,rh3) and electric displacementDh in the direction of k1, k2, k3 and k4. However, as a consequence of the peculiar sin-
gularity, c has an awkward physical unit. A remedy suggested by Rice (1988) is to appeal to a ﬁxed length ‘ and use the
combination

hð1 dR þ ieaÞ‘iea ic as thebasic parameterwhichhas thedimensionand the scale of conventional stress inten-
sity factors. Even so, the stress intensity factors still cannot be reduced to classical stress intensity factors for a crack tip in a
homogeneousmedium, because the directions of k1, k2, k3 and k4 are usually not the same as the direction of the crack. To have
a comparabledeﬁnition, transformationpre-multipliedbyK is suggested in (Hwu, 1993) for the interface crackproblems.With
this understanding, a proper deﬁnition of stress/electric intensity factors for the piezoelectric multi-wedges can be given as

From (3.13) and (3.14b), we see that the relation between the coefﬁcient vector c and the stress intensity factors k is
k ¼

Khð1 dR þ ieaÞ‘iea ic: ð3:15Þ
Note that from the deﬁnition given in (3.14), we see that Khðr=‘Þiea iK1 should be real in order to have a real value of k,
which has been proved analytically in (Hwu, 1993) for the interface cracks lying between two anisotropic elastic materials.
For the general piezoelectric multi-wedges, only numerical check has been done.
Using the relation (3.15), the near tip solution shown in (3.11) and (3.12) can now be rewritten in terms of the stress/elec-
tric intensity factors k as

and the subscript c denotes the value associated with the most critical singular order and the subscript 2 or the superscript

3.4. Corner opening displacement/electric potential
The difference of the displacements and electric potential between two outer wedge surfaces can be calculated through
the use of (3.16)1 as

the difference of electric potential on the two outer wedge surfaces.

4.2. Interface cracks between two dissimilar piezoelectric materials
If we set h0 = p, h1 = 0 and h2 = p, a bi-wedge with free–free surfaces can represent a bimaterial with a semi-inﬁnite
interface crack. With these special angles, the near tip solution shown in (3.8) can be further reduced to
u1ðr; hÞ ¼ r1dEð1Þ1 ðhÞu0;

The matrix Kð3Þe used for the determination of the singular orders can then be calculated from (3.4b) in which Ke = E2E1 for
the present problem. The ﬁnal simpliﬁed expression for Kð3Þe is
Kð3Þe ¼

ðsin dpÞeidpL2ðM þ e2idpMÞL1: ð4:10Þ
It is known that matrix L is negative deﬁnite for piezoelectric materials (Kuo and Barnett, 1991), and hence kL1k 6¼ 0,
kL2k 6¼ 0. Also, sindp 6¼ 0 in the region of 0 < ReðdÞ < 1. With these nonzero values in (4.10), the determination of the singular
order d and its associated eigenvector u0 from (3.4a)2 and (3.10)2 can now be reduced to
ðM þ e2idpMÞk ¼ 0; where k ¼  sin dpL1u0: ð4:11Þ
In the above a factor sindp is multiplied on L1 u0 for the purpose of adjusting the eigenvector k to k(0) deﬁned later in
(4.15d).
By using the last equality of (2.15)2, Eq. (4.11) can be further reduced to
ðW cot dpDÞk ¼ 0: ð4:12Þ
The explicit solution to (4.12) has been given by Ting (1986) for the pure anisotropic materials and by Kuo and Barnett
(1991) for piezoelectric materials. A simple derivation for readers to quickly understand how the solution was derived is pre-
sented in Appendix B. Followings are the solutions shown in (Kuo and Barnett, 1991; Suo et al., 1992)

Let ca, a = 1, 2, 3, 4 be the constant multiplier of ka for each singular order da = 1/2 + iea, the near tip solution (4.9a) can
now be written in the form of (3.11a), i.e.,

5.1. Collinear cracks subjected to uniform load/induction at inﬁnity
The full ﬁeld solutions u(r,h) and /(r,h) for displacements, electric potential, stress functions and induction potential can
be obtained by referring to the solutions presented in (Hwu, 1991) for pure anisotropic problems. By reducing the full ﬁeld
solutions to the near tip, the stress/electric intensity factors k, crack opening displacements Du and energy release rate G for
several different crack numbers all have the following relations
k ¼ kt12 ; Du ¼ Df ðx1ÞL1t12 ; G ¼

k and Df(x1) will be different for different crack numbers. In other words, the crack geometry is responsible for the factor k
and the opening shape Df(x1), while the effects of external loading/induction and material properties are reﬂected by t12 and
L1. The stress/electric intensity factors are independent of the material properties and have linear relations with the exter-
nal loading/induction. The crack opening displacements and energy release rate are inﬂuenced by the material properties
through the real matrix L1 whose explicit expressions have been shown in (2.17) and (2.20) for two speciﬁc piezoelectric
materials. The detailed expressions of k and Df(x1) for different crack geometries are shown below.

6. Conclusions
Several explicit solutions related to the corners and cracks in piezoelectric materials are presented in this paper. For pie-
zoelectric multi-wedges, the near tip solutions for displacement/electric potential and stress/electric displacement are writ-
ten in terms of the stress/electric stress intensity factors. For cracks and interface cracks, the crack opening displacement/
electric potential and energy release rate are also written in terms of stress/electric intensity factors in explicit form. The
explicit solutions for the stress/electric intensity factors of several different crack problems are obtained in matrix form
for general piezoelectric materials and presented in component form for two typical piezoelectric ceramics. Several piezo-
effects which were studied from the numerical and experimental results can now be observed from the explicit component
form solutions shown in this paper.

Green’s Functions for Anisotropic/Piezoelectric
Bimaterials and Their Applications to Boundary Element
Analysis
Y.C. Chen1 and Chyanbin Hwu2
Abstract: The Green’s function for anisotropic bimaterials has been investigated
around three decades ago. Since the mathematical formulation of piezoelectric
elasticity can be organized into the same form as that of anisotropic elasticity by just
expanding the dimension of the corresponding matrix to include the piezoelectric
effects, the extension of the Green’s function to piezoelectric bimaterials can be ob-
tained immediately through the associated anisotropic bimaterials. In this paper, the
Green’s function for the bimaterials bonded together with one anisotropic material
and one piezoelectric material is derived by applying Stroh’s complex variable for-
malism with the aid of analytical continuation method. For this problem, the inter-
facial condition of electric field depends on the electric conductivity of anisotropic
elastic materials. Employing these Green’s functions, a special boundary element
satisfying the interfacial continuity conditions of anisotropic/piezoelectric bimate-
rials is developed. With the embedded Green’s functions, this special boundary
element preserves two special features: (1) the interface continuity conditions are
satisfied exactly and no meshes are needed along the interface; (2) the materials be-
low and above the interface can be any kinds of piezoelectric or anisotropic elastic
materials. To show the advantages of the present special boundary element, sev-
eral numerical examples such as orthotropic/isotropic bimaterials, PZT-7A/PZT-5H
bimaterials and anisotropic/piezoelectric bimaterials are illustrated and compared
with the solutions calculated by other numerical methods. The numerical results
show that the present special boundary element is not only accurate but also effi-
cient.

special boundary elements, in this paper we further apply the Green’s functions for
anisotropic/piezoelectric bimaterials to improve the traditional boundary elements.
In this way, no meshes are needed along the interfaces and the materials below and
above the interface can be any kinds of piezoelectric or anisotropic elastic materi-
als. Since the continuity conditions have been satisfied exactly and no meshes are
needed along the interfaces, for the interface problems the present special bound-
ary element is much more accurate and efficient than the other numerical methods
such as finite element method and traditional boundary element method. These
advantages are confirmed through numerical examples for three different kinds of
bimaterials - orthotropic/isotropic, PZT-7A/PZT-5H and anisotropic/piezoelectric
bimaterials.

In a fixed rectangular coordinate system xi, i = 1,2,3, let ui,σi j,εi j,D j, and Ek
be, respectively, the displacement, stress, strain, electric displacement (or called
induction) and electric field. The constitutive laws, strain-displacement equations
and the equilibrium equations for anisotropic elasticity are [Ting (1996)]

(ui, j+u j,i), σi j, j = 0, i, j,k, l = 1,2,3 (1)
where repeated indices imply summation, a comma stands for differentiation. In
eqn.(1) the body forces are neglected and the elastic constants Ci jkl are assumed to
be fully symmetric and positive definite.
For piezoelectric anisotropic elasticity, to include the piezoelectric effects the con-
stitutive laws should be modified and the electrostatic equations should be consid-
ered, and hence the basic equations are modified as follows. [Rogacheva (1994)]

3 Green’s Functions
3.1 Anisotropic bimaterials
Consider a bimaterial that consists of two dissimilar anisotropic elastic half-spaces.
Let the upper half-space x2 > 0 be occupied by material 1 and the lower half-
space x2 < 0 be occupied by material 2 (see Fig. 1). Assume these two dissimilar
materials are perfectly bonded along the interface x2 = 0. The Green’s function
for bimaterials is the elasticity solution for a bimaterial subjected to a concentrated
force pˆ applied at point xˆ= (xˆ1, xˆ2) of material 1. The boundary conditions of this
problem can be expressed as
u1 = u2, ±φ1 =±φ2, along the interface x2 = 0,∫
C
d±φ1 = pˆ for any closed curve C enclosing the point xˆ,

3.3 Anisotropic/piezoelectric bimaterials
In this subsection the anisotropic elastic materials are categorized into two kinds,
conductors and insulators. The electric field Ei of the conductors is considered to
be zero in the entire body, whereas the electric displacement Di of the insulators is
zero. With the relations u4, j =−E j, φ4,1 =D2 and φ4,2 =−D1 given in (4) and (8),
we know that the electric continuity conditions for the conductors and insulators
can be represented, respectively, by u4 = 0 and φ4 = 0 along the interface.
Case (i): the anisotropic material is a conductor
Consider a bimaterial whose upper half-space x2 > 0 (region S1) is occupied by a
piezoelectric material and the lower half-space x2 < 0 (region S2) is occupied by an
anisotropic elastic conductor. If a point force/charge pˆ=(pˆ1, pˆ2, pˆ3, qˆ)T is applied
at point xˆ = (xˆ1, xˆ2) of material 1, the boundary conditions along the interface can
be written as
u(1)i = u
(2)
i , φ
(1)
i = φ
(2)
i , i= 1,2,3, u
(1)
4 = 0, along the interface x2 = 0. (14)
The equilibrium and infinity conditions can still be expressed by using the last two
equations of (10). To find the solution satisfying all the boundary conditions, we
first assume the solution be expressed in the form of eqn.(11) whose complex func-
tion vectors f1(z(1)) and f2(z(2)) will be determined through the use of analytical
continuation method. f0(z(1)) that represents the Green’s function of homogeneous
materials is still the one given in the first equations of (12).
With the general solutions given in (11), the boundary conditions (14) may now be
written as
Ae1[f0(x1)+ f1(x1)]+ A¯
e
1[f0(x1)+ f1(x1)] = A2f2(x1)+ A¯2f2(x1),
Be1[f0(x1)+ f1(x1)]+ B¯
e
1[f0(x1)+ f1(x1)] = B2f2(x1)+ B¯2f2(x1),
Ap1 [f0(x1)+ f1(x1)]+ A¯
p
1 [f0(x1)+ f1(x1)] = 0,
(15)
where Ae1 and B
e
1 are two 3×4 matrices, Ap1 and Bp1 are two 1×4 matrices, and they
are the submatrices of A1 and B1 defined by
A1 =
[
Ae1
Ap1
]
, B1 =
[
Be1
Bp1
]
. (16)
The dimensions of the other vectors and matrices are f0, f1 : 4× 1, f2 : 3× 1 and
A2,B2 : 3×3.
One of the important properties of the holomorphic functions is that f1(z¯) will be
holomorphic in S2 if f1(z) is holomorphic in S1. Similarly, f0(z¯) and f2(z¯) will be
Green’s Functions for Anisotropic/Piezoelectric Bimaterials and Their Applications to Boundary Element Analysis39
f1(z) and f2(z) can be obtained by substituting (12)1 into (19a) and employing the
translation technique. The results are
f1(z(1)) =

∑
j=1
< ln(z(2)α − zˆ(1)j )> A−12 (Ae1− A¯e1G−13 G4)I jAT1 pˆ.
(19)
Case (ii): the anisotropic material is an insulator
Same situation as case (i) is considered here except that the conductor of material
2 is now replaced by an insulator. With this replacement, the boundary conditions
along the interface can be written as
u(1)i = u
(2)
i , φ
(1)
i = φ
(2)
i , i= 1,2,3, φ
(1)
4 = 0, along the interface x2 = 0. (20)
By a similar approach as case (i), the explicit full field solutions of f1(z) and f2(z)
can be obtained as follows.

3.4 Discussions
From the above solutions we see that Green’s functions of the anisotropic bima-
terials and piezoelectric bimaterials have exactly the same mathematical forms,
whereas those of the anisotropic/piezoelectric bimaterials are different. Since piezo-
electric materials can be specialized to anisotropic materials by neglecting their
piezoelectric constants, it is expected that Green’s functions of anisotropic /piezo-
electric bimaterials may be reduced from those of piezoelectric bimaterials through
the specialization of piezoelectric tensor and dielectric permittivity tensor. From
the constitutive relations shown in (2), we observe that the alternative solutions of
(20) and (22) can be obtained from the Green’s function of piezoelectric bimateri-
als by letting eki j = 0 and ωεi j→ ∞ for conductors, and letting eki j = 0 and ωεi j→ 0
for insulators.
Green’s Functions for Anisotropic/Piezoelectric Bimaterials and Their Applications to Boundary Element Analysis41
we can now write down the results of T∗ and U∗ as
T∗ =
{
2Re{ [Bα(F0,s+F1,s)]T}, if ξ ∈ S1,x ∈ S1, or ξ ∈ S2,x ∈ S2,
2Re{[BαF2,s]T}, if ξ ∈ S1,x ∈ S2, or ξ ∈ S2,x ∈ S1,
U∗ =
{
2Re{ [Aα(F0+F1)]T}, if xˆ ∈ S1,x ∈ S1, or ξ ∈ S2,x ∈ S2,
2Re{[AαF2]T}, if ξˆ ∈ S1,ξ ∈ S2, or ξ ∈ S2,x ∈ S1,
(25)
in which the subscript α = 1, if x∈ S1 and α = 2, if x∈ S2.F0,F1and F2 are related
to f0(z(α)), f1(z(α)) and f2(z(α)) obtained in Section 3 by
f0(z(α)) = F0pˆ, f1(z(α)) = F1pˆ, f2(z(α)) = F2pˆ. (26)
5 Boundary Element Formulation
After getting the fundamental solutions in (26), the unknowns remained in the
boundary integral equations (25) are u and t over the boundary Γ. In boundary
element formulation, the boundary Γ is approximated by a series of elements, and
the points x, displacements u and tractions t on the boundary are approximated by
the nodal points xn, nodal displacement un and nodal traction tn through different
interpolation functions. In this paper, we assume the same linear variation within
each element for the boundary points x, displacements u and tractions t. Thus, the
values of x, u and t at any point on the mth element can be defined in terms of their
nodal values and two linear interpolation functions ϖ1 and ϖ2 of the dimensionless
coordinate ς , such that
x= ϖ1x
(1)
m +ϖ2x
(2)
m , u= ϖ1u
(1)
m +ϖ2u
(2)
m , t= ϖ1t
(1)
m +ϖ2t
(2)
m , (27)
where a symbol with subscript m and superscript (1) or (2) denotes the value of
node 1 or 2 of the mth element. The interpolation functions ϖ1 and ϖ2 are given by
ϖ1 =
1
2
(1− ς), ϖ2 = 12(1+ ς), (28)
where ς is the dimensionless coordinate defined by ς = 2s/`m in which `m is the
length of the mth element and s is the coordinate lying along the linear element and
directed from the first node to the second node of element m.
If the boundary Γ is discretized into M segments with N nodes, substitution of (28)
Green’s Functions for Anisotropic/Piezoelectric Bimaterials and Their Applications to Boundary Element Analysis43
Consider ξ to be the location of node i and use Ci,ui, Yˆin,Gin to denote the values
of C,u, Yˆn,Gn at node i. Equation (34) can now be expressed as
N
∑
n=1
Yinun =
N
∑
n=1
Gintn, i= 1,2, ...,N, (34a)
in which
Yin =Yˆin, for i 6= n,
Yin =Yˆin+Ci, for i= n.
(34b)
When all the nodes are taken into consideration, equation (35a) produces a 3N×3N
system of equations. By applying the boundary condition such that either ui or ti
at each node is prescribed, the system of equations (35a) can be reordered in such
a way that the final system of equations can be expressed as Kv=p where K is a
fully populated matrix, v is a vector containing all the boundary unknowns and p
is a vector containing all the prescribed values given on the boundary. Once (35a)
has been solved, all the values of tractions and displacements on the boundary
are determined. With this result, the values of stresses and displacements at any
interior point can be calculated through the strain-displacement relation and the
stress-strain law shown in eqns. (1) and (2).
6 Numerical Examples
To show the advantages of the present special boundary element method (SBEM),
in this section several numerical examples such as orthotropic/isotropic, PZT-7A/PZT-
5H and anisotropic/piezoelectric bimaterials are illustrated.
Example 1. orthotropic/isotropic bimaterials
An orthotropic/isotropic bimaterial subjected to uniform tension σˆ = 1MPa is con-
sidered in this example. The loading, geometry and boundary element meshes of
this problem are shown in Fig. 2. The material above the interface is orthotropic
whose mechanical properties are:
E11 = 134.45GPa, E22 = E33 = 11.03GPa, v12 = v13 = 0.301, v23 = 0.49,
G12 = G13 = 5.84GPa, G23 = 2.98GPa,
and the material below the interface is isotropic whose properties are E = 10GPa
and v = 0.2. Fig. 3 shows the results of stresses along the interface. From this
figure we see that the stresses calculated from the finite element software ANSYS
are discontinuous across the interface, which will approach to a continuous value

Interface corners in piezoelectric materials
Received: 28 August 2009 / Revised: 3 November 2009 / Published online: 21 April 2010

Abstract Through proper arrangement, the constitutive law, strain-displacement relation and equilibrium
equation of piezoelectric materials can be written in the same mathematical form as those of elastic materials
and hence Stroh formalism can be extended for piezoelectric analysis. Based on this viewpoint, the authors’
previous works for fracture analysis of anisotropic elastic materials, e.g. the eigen-relation for determining
singular orders, the near-tip solutions, and the unified definition of stress intensity factors for interface corners,
can also be applied to piezoelectric materials. In this paper, the theoretical framework of our previous works is
briefly introduced, and then an efficient and accurate computing method (H-integral) and its required auxiliary
solutions are derived for extracting the stress/electric intensity factors of interface corners made up of piezo-
electric materials. This theoretical framework and H-integral form a universal solution technique that is valid
for the fracture analysis of cracks, corners, interface cracks, and interface corners. Besides, the special cases
that suggest how we simulate elastic insulators/conductors from piezoelectric materials are discussed. Several
numerical examples are dealt with to display the feasibility and applicability of the proposed approaches,
and finally, a numerical example which exhibits how the electric load influences the fracture behavior is also
studied.
1 Introduction
Electronic feedback control has been widely applied to advanced control systems in which sensor and actuator
are two very important elements. Because of the electric–mechanical coupling effects, piezoelectric materials
are usually adopted as the constituents of the sensor and actuator. Besides, interface corners are very common
structures appearing within engineering objects, and interface cracks are special cases of them. Hence, the
fracture behavior of interface corners in piezoelectric materials is very worthy to be studied. Stresses and
electric displacements (or called inductions, electric flux densities) around the tip of corner/crack may exhibit
singular and oscillatory behavior due to the discontinuities of geometry and material properties, and hence lots
of failures initiate from this critical region. Orders of stress/electric singularity and stress/electric intensity
factors are two important indices usually employed to evaluate the degree of danger and the mode of fracture
within the category of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM).
In the past two decades, following the works of Kuo and Barnett [1], Suo et al. [2], Rogacheva [3] and
Ting [4], the extended Stroh formalism which satisfies the constitutive law, strain-displacement relation and
equilibrium equation of piezoelectric materials has been well developed to provide the general solution for
solving lots of two-dimensional electromechanical problems. Through this general solution, many researches
about fracture analysis of piezoelectric materials, which include analytical derivations or numerical treatments

and Re stands for the real part. The generalized displacement (or called electric potential) u4 is related to the
electric field Ei by
Ei = −u4,i , i = 1, 2. (2.4a)
The generalized stress functions φi , i = 1, 2, 3, 4 are related to the stresses and electric displacements by
σi1 = −φi,2, σi2 = φi,1, i = 1, 2, 3, and D1 = σ41 = −φ4,2, D2 = σ42 = φ4,1. (2.4b)
By using (2.4b), it can also be proved that the generalized stress function vector φ and surface traction vector
t possess the following simple relation:
t = ∂φ/∂s, (2.4c)
where s is the arc length measured along the curved boundary such that when one faces the direction of
increasing s the material lies on the right-hand side. From (2.4c), we have t = φ,r for a radial line surface and
t = φ,θ /r for a circular surface, and hence, the stresses and electric displacements in polar coordinate can
also be calculated from the generalized stress function vector φ by
σθθ = nT φ,r , σrr = −sT φ,θ /r, σrθ = sT φ,r = −nT φ,θ /r,
σθ3 = iT3 φ,r , σr3 = −iT3 φ,θ /r, Dθ = iT4 φ,r , Dr = −iT4 φ,θ /r,
(2.5a)
where
sT = ( cos θ sin θ 0 0 ), nT = (−sin θ cos θ 0 0 ),

)
, iT4 =

In (2.3), fk(zk), k = 1, 2, 3, 4 are four holomorphic functions of complex variables zk , which will be deter-
mined by the boundary conditions set for each particular problem. μk and (ak, bk) are the material eigenvalues
and eigenvectors which can be determined by the following eigen-relations:
Nξ = μξ , (2.6a)
where N is a 8 × 8 fundamental matrix, and ξ is a 8 × 1 column vector defined by
N =
[
N1 N2
N3 NT1

}
, (2.6b)
and
N1 = −T−1RT , N2 = T−1 = NT2 , N3 = RT−1RT − Q = NT3 . (2.6c)
Q, R, T are three 4 × 4 real matrices defined by the elastic constants as well as the piezoelectric stress tensor
and dielectric permittivity tensor whose detailed expressions can be found in [19].
3 Piezoelectric interface corners
Consider an interface corner between two dissimilar piezoelectric anisotropic elastic materials (Fig. 1). Assume
perfect bonding along the interface. The traction/induction and displacement/electric-potential continuity
across the interface can then be written as
u1(0) = u2(0), φ1(0) = φ2(0), (3.1)
where the subscripts 1 and 2 denote the values related to materials 1 and 2, and the argument 0 denotes the
values on the interface whose θ = 0. The two outer surfaces of the interface corner are assumed to be free-free
where “free” means mechanically free and electrically open (or electrically impermeable) and can be expressed
as
φ1(θ0) = φ2(θ2) = 0. (3.2)

3.2 Near-tip solutions
The displacements, stresses, electric fields and electric displacements near the apex of piezoelectric interface
corners can be obtained from the following solutions which sometimes are called eigenfunctions:
u(r, θ) = r1−δR V(θ) < r iεα > c,
φ(r, θ) = r1−δR (θ) < r iεα > c, (3.6a)
where
V(θ) = [η1(θ) η2(θ) η3(θ) η4(θ)],
(θ) = [λ1(θ) λ2(θ) λ3(θ) λ4(θ)], (3.6b)
and ηi (θ) and λi (θ), i = 1, 2, 3, 4 are functions related to Nˆ1−δk (θ, θk−1) and (Ke)k−1 [19]. In (3.6a), c is a
coefficient vector containing the coefficients c1, c2, c3 and c4 associated with the most critical singular order
δ = δR + iεα, α = 1, 2, 3, 4.
3.3 Stress/electric intensity factors
A proper definition for the interface corner has been proposed recently [17], which can be reduced to the
conventional definition for cracks in homogeneous anisotropic materials or for cracks along the interfaces
between two dissimilar anisotropic materials. Here, we extend this definition to the present cases of piezoelec-
tric interface corners, which can now be written as

θ=0
√
2πr δR  < (r/)−iεα > −1φ,r (r, θ), (3.7b)
in which  = (0) and  is a reference length employed to smooth the physical unit of k associated with the
complex singular orders. Their relation with the coefficient vector c is
k = √2π < (1 − δR + iεα)iεα > c. (3.8)
Using the relation (3.8), the near-tip solution shown in (3.6) can now be rewritten in terms of the stress/
electric intensity factors k as
u(r, θ) = 1√
2π
r1−δR V(θ) < (1 − δR + iεα)−1(r/)iεα > −1k,
φ(r, θ) = 1√
2π
r1−δR (θ) < (1 − δR + iεα)−1(r/)iεα > −1k,
φ,r (r, θ) =
1√
2π
r−δR (θ) < (r/)iεα > −1k. (3.9)
From the examples given in [18], we see that if only the most critical singular order is considered, certain
modes of stress intensity factors will be lost even though the specimen is subjected to mixed-mode loading. The
missing modes maybe come from the stress/electric fields associated with the lower singular orders. Hence,
to provide a proper definition for the stress/electric intensity factors associated with the lower singular orders,
the near-tip solutions shown in (3.9) should be extended to include all the possible singular orders, i.e.,
u(r, θ) = u1(r, θ) + u2(r, θ) + u3(r, θ) + · · · ,
φ(r, θ) = φ1(r, θ) + φ2(r, θ) + φ3(r, θ) + · · · , (3.10)

[ˆ′T (θ)V(θ) − VˆT (θ)′(θ)]dθ, (4.4b)
and the ′ denotes the differentiation with respect to θ . Then, we can evaluate the H-integral (4.1) via the other
integral path with arbitrary shape far from the corner/crack tip to determine the unknown coefficient vector c.
In Eq. (4.1), the H-integral can be written in component form as
H =

where
ti = σi1n1 + σi2n2, i = 1, 2, 3, t4 = D1n1 + D2n2,
tˆi = σˆi1n1 + σˆi2n2, i = 1, 2, 3, tˆ4 = Dˆ1n1 + Dˆ2n2, (4.5b)
in which (n1, n2) is the normal direction of integration path  and n3 = 0 due to the 2D feature. If the integral
path  is selected to be a circular path, we may choose the polar coordinate to represent the displacements and
stresses, and Eq. (4.5a) can be further reduced to
H =
θn∫
θ0
(ur σˆrr + uθ σˆrθ + u4 Dˆr − uˆrσrr − uˆθσrθ − uˆ4 Dr )rdθ. (4.6)
If the integral path  is selected to be a rectangular path, Eq. (4.5a) can be further reduced to
H =
∫
(u1σˆ12 + u2σˆ22 + u4 Dˆ2 − uˆ1σ12 − uˆ2σ22 − uˆ4 D2)dx
+
∫
(u1σˆ11 + u2σˆ12 + u4 Dˆ1 − uˆ1σ11 − uˆ2σ12 − uˆ4 D1)dy. (4.7)
Note that Eqs. (4.6) and (4.7) are reduced for the general two-dimensional cases whose u3 = 0 or t3 = 0.
Let Hi , i = 1, 2, 3, 4, be the value of H with cˆi = 1 and cˆ j = 0, i = j , and then the unknown coefficient
vector c containing ci , i = 1, 2, 3, 4, can be solved from Eq. (4.4a) as
c = H∗−1h, where h =

Combining the relations (3.8) and (4.8) will lead to
k = √2π < (1 − δR + iεα)iεα > H∗−1h. (4.9)
Equation (4.9) is the direct relation between H-integral and stress/electric intensity factors associated with the
most critical singular order δ, and the components H∗i j of H∗ can be expressed according to the type of δ as
the following cases:
Case 1: when δ is a real simple root, H∗11 = 0, all other H∗i j = 0.
Case 2: when δ is a real double root, H∗11, H∗12, H∗21, H∗22 = 0, in general; all other H∗i j = 0.
Case 3: when δ is a real triple root, H∗i j = 0, i, j = 1, 2, 3, in general;H∗4 j = H∗j4 = 0, j = 1, 2, 3, 4.
Case 4: when δ is a real fourfold root, H∗i j = 0, i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4, in general.
Case 5: when δ is a pair of complex root, H∗11, H∗22 = 0, all other H∗i j = 0.
Case 6: when δ is a combination of one real simple root and one pair of complex roots,
H∗11, H∗22, H∗33 = 0, all other H∗i j = 0.

Fig. 2 An interface corner between two dissimilar piezoelectric materials
at any point within material 1 when P → ∞. Therefore, u4 should be a constant at any point within material
1 when P is large enough. On the interface whose θ = 0, we can obtain that
[u4(r, 0)]2 = [u4(r, 0)]1 = constant, (5.4)
through the use of continuity conditions (3.1), and this is the correct interface condition between an elastic
conductor and a piezoelectric material. It should be mentioned that u4 is directly assumed to be zero along
the interface to solve orders of stress/electric singularity in literatures [11,14]. The thoughts mentioned in this
section will be numerical examined in the fourth example in the next section.
6 Numerical examples
In this section, several numerical examples are presented to show the feasibility and applicability of the
approach proposed in this paper. First, an interface crack between two dissimilar piezoelectric materials is
analyzed for numerically checking the path-independent property of the H-integral. Then, a specimen shown
in Fig. 2 is designed to perform the remaining examples because an interface crack can be set by letting β = 0◦
for the interface corner, and a corner/crack in a homogeneous material can be set by letting material 2 be
equal to material 1. In all examples, the length W is fixed as 0.3 m while a and h may change according to
different values of β; along the vertical edge x1 = −a, due to symmetry the displacement in x1-dierction is
set to zero, i.e., u1 = 0; at the point x1 = W & x2 = 0, we set u2 = 0; a uniform tensile loading σ0 = 1MPa
is applied on both horizontal edges in which the lower edge is also subjected to a uniform electric flux density
D0 = 0.001C/m2, while the upper edge is electrically constrained by u4 = 0; the corner/crack surfaces
are electrically impermeable. In all examples, the 2D states of generalized plane strain and short circuit are
assumed, and the actual physical quantities for evaluating u and t are obtained from the commercial finite
element software ANSYS and a 2D 8-Node coupled-field solid element PLANE223 is adopted to perform the
analyses. In our numerical implementation, a convergence test is done and the element number is designed to
be 7,688 when β = 0◦, whereas lower element numbers are used for the other corner angle.

Example 1 Numerical check for the path-independent property of H-integral
To provide further evidence for proving that the H-integral is path-independent, we choose an interface
crack which is simulated by specifying β = 0◦ in Fig. 2 to perform the calculation. In this example, the crack
length a is 0.01 m and the ratio a/W is selected to be 1/30 to simulate an infinite domain. The material below
the interface is selected to be a piezoelectric ceramic PZT-5H, while the one above the interface is PZT-7A.
These two piezoelectric ceramics are both polarized along the x2-axis, whose material properties are given in
Table 1. Two circular paths with different radii (Fig. 4a) and four rectangular paths with wide ranges (Fig. 4b)
are chosen to perform the H-integral. Table 2 shows that the stress/electric intensity factors calculated through
different paths are almost the same as those calculated by the analytical solution for the infinite domain problem
[19]. Note that the mode-III intensity factor equals zero due to the 2D feature of this example and is not shown
in Table 2.
Example 2 Corners in a homogenous piezoelectric ceramic
This example displays the trends of stress intensity factors versus the opening angles of corners in a homo-
geneous piezoelectric ceramic. The homogeneous material is made of PZT-5H which is polarized along the
x2-axis to constitute materials 1 and 2 in Fig. 2, and the properties of PZT-5H are listed in Table 1. The
most critical singular order δ and its associated mode of stress intensity factor K I for corner β = 0◦ ∼ 80◦
are shown in Table 3. By following the suggestion made by Kuo and Hwu [18] we can find that δ for the
case β = 0◦ corresponds to all four modes of stress/electric intensity factors, while δ for the other cases
(β = 10◦ ∼ 80◦) merely relates to K I via checking the shapes of the matrix (0) and the generalized stress
function φ(r, 0). Consequently, we need to employ the lower singular orders to calculate the other modes of
stress/electric intensity factors. Except for the crack case, every case has totally four singular orders within
the region 0 < Re(δ) < 1, and δ(2), δ(3), and δ(4) correspond to K I I I , K I V , and K I I , respectively. However,
because of the 2D characteristic and the applied tensile loads, both K I I and K I I I equal zero for each case in
this example. The values of δ(3) and K I V versus different values of β are listed in Table 3. Through this Table,
we see that both K I and K I V increase due to the change from crack to corner and the enlargement of corner
angle when they are compared under different units. The correctness of the proposed approach can be verified
through the results of δ, K I , and K I V for the crack case β = 0◦.
Example 3 Interface corners between two dissimilar piezoelectric ceramics
In this example, we use the same material combination, boundary conditions, and loading conditions as
Example 1 but vary the corner angle within 0◦ and 80◦ to observe the influence of interface on the fracture
behavior of corners. During the numerical calculation, we found that when the corner angle is in the range of
10◦ ≤ β ≤ 80◦, the intensity factors associated with the most critical singular order δ consist of K I , K I I and

singular order. Since the mode-III intensity factor always equals zero due to the 2D feature of this example,
we have no need to use the lower singular orders in this example. Table 4 shows the results of the most critical
singular order and its associated stress/electric intensity factors versus corner angle, from which we see that
the value of K I increases when the interface corner becomes wider, whereas K I I and K I V have no obvious
trends. So far not enough reference solutions have been presented; hence, we only check our results with the
existing solutions for the interface cracks. The comparison shows that our results agree well with the reference
solutions for interface crack. Note that the reference length  = 2a is selected for the interface crack because
its δ is a complex number.
Example 4 An interface crack between a piezoelectric ceramic and an elastic insulator/conductor
In this example, material 1 is selected to be an insulator epoxy or a conductor nickel, while material 2
is composed of PZT-4. All the boundary and loading conditions are the same as in Example 1. The material
properties of PZT-4, epoxy, and nickel are listed in Table 1 in which we let the dielectric permittivity tensor
ωεjk of epoxy and nickel to be the one of PZT-4 multiplying with the permittivity scaling factor P . Table 5
shows our results of δ, K I , K I I , and K I V for the interface crack between epoxy and PZT-4, and we can see
that the results become stable and close to the reference solutions when P is small enough. Table 6 shows the
results of δ, K I , K I I , and K I V for the interface crack between nickel and PZT-4. As P is large enough, this
Table exhibits that our results become stable and the stable δ agrees well with the reference solution.
In order to check whether our results can satisfy the correct interface conditions mentioned in Sect. 5, we
substitute the values of K I , K I I , and K I V obtained in Tables 5 and 6 into the near-tip solutions (3.9) and plot
the results in Figs. 5 and 6. Figure 5 shows Dθ (r, 0) versus r with various P for the interface crack between
PZT-4 and epoxy, from which we see that Dθ (r, 0) far away from r = 0 becomes more and more close to
zero when P decreases. Due to the singular behavior, Dθ (r, 0) increases rapidly when r approaches to zero.
Figure 6 shows u4(r, 0) versus r with various P for the interface crack between PZT-4 and nickel, from which
we see that u4(r, 0) becomes more and more close to a constant “zero” when P increases. The constant “zero”
comes from the boundary and loading conditions applied in Fig. 2. Through the data plotted in Figs. 5 and
6 and the comparison between our results and reference solutions shown in Tables 5 and 6, we can conclude

Fig. 7 Stress/electric intensity factors versus electric load D0 for interface corner β = 30◦ between PZT-5H and PZT-7A
κ-singularity (all singular orders are real). In other words, the classification of the singular orders depends not
only on the corner angle but also on the material properties. One may refer to [2,12,13,33,34] for more detailed
discussions on the classification of singular orders for an interface crack between two dissimilar piezoelectric
materials or piezoelectric/dielectric materials.
Example 5 Effect of electric load on the stress intensity factors
To study the effect of electric load on the stress/electric intensity factors, the interface corner is fixed on
β = 30◦ and the electric flux density D0 specified on the bottom edge (Fig. 1) is varied within −0.1C/m2
and 0.1C/m2, and all the other boundary and loading conditions are the same as in Example 3. Figure 7 plots
the values of K I , K I I , and K I V versus the electric load D0 and it shows that the stress/electric intensity
factors decrease linearly with D0. Based on this phenomenon, we may utilize the piezoelectric effect to accel-
erate or retard the mechanical failure of a specimen, or even design a specific electric load to produce pure
mechanical-mode fracture for the establishment of failure criteria in experiments.
7 Concluding remarks
A universal solution method which is applicable for the interface corners in piezoelectric materials is presented
in this paper. Through this method, the orders of stress/electric singularity and the stress/electric intensity factors
for cracks, interface cracks, corners or interface corners can all be evaluated through the same computational
approach. The feasibility and accuracy of this solution method can be seen through the numerical examples
shown in Sect. 6. Moreover, the path-independent property of the H-integral has been numerically verified via
several integral paths with different shapes and ranges for 2D piezoelectric problems. Besides, the special cases
which simulate elastic insulators or conductors via a simple simplification of piezoelectric material properties
are also presented in this paper. The interface conditions between a piezoelectric material and an elastic insu-
lator or conductor are also checked. Finally, via the last example, we see that stress/electric intensity factors
alter linearly with the electric load D0 and we may utilize this characteristic to make some special engineering
designs for advanced studies of piezoelectric fracture analyses.

2. 應爭取已具規模及知名度之國際會議的主辦權，如此可吸引較多且較優秀之
學者前來，同時也較能過濾文章之品質。 (本次會議之規模及知名度皆高，很輕易
地就有近一千篇文章投稿，主辦單位也因此進行審查及篩選的作業，以維持會議論
文之品質。) 
3. 會議之安排必須非常細心，例如：論文集應找國際知名書商承印以廣開銷售
管道並打開國內相關研究之國際知名度，同時亦可將論文集錄製成光碟片以方便攜
帶；論文集附錄必須有 Author Index，Subject Index 等以方便聆聽場次之選擇及論文

細心之規劃。(本次會議承辦單位相當認真，相關安排頗為細心，會中不但提供紙本
之會議議程及摘要論文集，亦提供 CD-ROM，對會議期間之參閱頗為方便，同時會
中安排之社交行程皆會留意參與者之反應，並協助處理參與者之問題，可算是一盡
心盡力之承辦單位。 唯論文集少了 Subject Index 及與會者之學校和國家等資訊，造
成些許不便。) 
4.會議地點應可考慮觀光地點之大飯店，同時事前設法議取誘人之價格，以方
便國外學者攜眷前來。 同時會議住宿之安排必須非常細心，例如：住宿地點與會議
場地間之交通，住宿地之餐飲問題等等。若可能，住宿地點與會議場地同一且屬五
星級飯店價格低廉，即是一優質組合。(本次會議所在地點並非市中心，而是一豪華
莊園，確實讓與會者有絕佳之感受，只是公共交通不很方便，例如晚宴結束後已
10:30，已無任何公共交通工具可以載送與會者回市區旅館，經參與者反應後大會雖
已安排 Bus 接送，但卻無明確之告知，害的許多與會學者彼此互問，才順利搭上接
駁車回到市區旅館。) 
5. 會議論文之篩選非常重要，否則夾雜部份不理想之作品及發表者，徒然浪費
大部份參與人員之寶貴時間，從而影響會議之品質。(本次會議已盡力做到，大多數
論文發表者及張貼論文都有周詳之事前準備，且因故未能參與之比例也盡可能地降

二、與會心得 
本次參與會議的主要目的為論文發表與了解目前各國模擬研究發展進度和未來
方向。博士生葉育魁(Y.K. Yeh)與胡潛濱教授(Prof. Chyanbin Hwu)參加 Stuttgart
大學舉辦的 2011 模擬技術國際會議(2011 International Conference on Simulation 
Technology)。這次是我第一次參加國際會議，很幸運的在我所喜愛的德國舉辦，也
是我從小到大第一次自己出國。雖然人生地不熟的，也對德語毫無涉略，但還好大致
上德國是個可用英文溝通的國家，基本的生活辭彙都不成問題。從小在台灣的英語教
育下成長的我，更可藉由這次機會，測試自己的口說能力。另一方面，整個德國的交
通網可說是相當發達，想去哪都可搭乘大眾運輸工具前往，幾乎沒甚麼地方是到不了
的，但其複雜的購票模式，也讓我們搞得一頭霧水。所幸有在當地念書的華人，給予
我們了許多協助。總而言之，德國是個相當適合旅遊的好地方。 
ㄧ到了會場，熟悉的華人面孔並不多。比較特別的是，這次的會議德國本身的
教授及學生占了一大部分，也都是在模擬技術方面的佼佼者。在這幾天的演講當中，
其內容包含了分子的模擬、多尺度模擬技術和系統分析等等，甚至有關於自然環境模
擬的議題。坐在台下的我，雖然對於英文的聽力方面還有待加強，但跟著 power point
以及我本來所具有的基本知識，也能了解其中的理論及其貢獻。這時才真的知道，原
來在這個領域的研究，其包羅之廣、探索之深，是之前我從來不曾體會的，真可說是
大開眼界。在 poster sessions 中，可與別國的學生討論彼此的研究，從談論之中知道
每個人思維方式的不同，更可學到許多不同角度的看法以及了解現在國際上相關研究
的進度。 
最後特別感謝國科會能給我這個機會補助經費讓我有這個機會見見世面，更感
謝胡潛濱在研究上的指導以及旅程中的幫助，雖然只有短短幾天的行程，但我在各方

finite element method (FEM) and boundary element method (BEM) are normally needed. In this paper, 
we consider the approach of BEM due to their advantage of dimension reduction. Generally, there are 
three different approaches to linear viscoelastic analysis by BEM. The first formulates a BEM in Laplace 
transform domain and obtain the solution in time domain by numerical inversion [1,2]. The second 
formulates a BEM directly in time domain [3-5]. Although the second approach looks more direct and 
efficient, but the lack of fundamental solutions in time domain restricts its applicability. To combine the 
advantages of the previous two approaches, a mixed BEM was proposed by Schanz [6], which can solve 
the problem in time domain but rely on the fundamental solutions in Laplace domain. In order to take 
advantage of the available fundamental solutions for the defects or interfaces in anisotropic elastic 
materials [7], the first approach, i.e., the transformed BEM to treat the problems of viscoelastic solids 
containing defects such as holes, cracks, inclusions, and/or interfaces has been done in our recent work 
[8]. In that study, several examples considering interfaces, holes, cracks, and/or inclusions have been 
illustrated and compared with the existing analytical or numerical solutions to show their correctness and 
efficiency. Here, we like to further extend the transformed BEM to more complicated problems such as 
the interface corners between two dissimilar viscoelastic materials, an elastic inclusion inside a 
viscoelastic material, and the simultaneous existence of inclusions, cracks, and holes in viscoelastic solids. 
2. Extended Stroh formalism for linear anisotropic viscoelasticity  
In a fixed rectangular coordinate system , 1,2,3,ix i   let ,  ,i iju   and ij  be, respectively, the 
displacement, stress and strain. The constitutive laws for linear anisotropic viscoelastic materials, the 
strain-displacement relations for small deformations, and the equilibrium equations for static loading 
conditions can be written as [9] 
 , , ,0 ( ) 1( ) ( ) (0) ( ) ,    ( ) ( ) ( ) ,        ( ) 0,2t klij ijkl kl ijkl ij i j j i ij jt C t C t d t u t u t t                        (1) 
where , , , 1, 2,3,i j k l  and the repeated indices imply summation; a comma stands for differentiation; 
( )ijklC t  
are the relaxation functions. Taking the Laplace transform of (1) gives 
 , , ,1( ) ( ) ( ),    ( ) ( ) ( ) ,    ( ) 0,2ij ijkl kl ij i j j i ij js sC s s s u s u s s                                                               (2) 
where s is the transform variable and the Laplace transform ( )f s

 of ( )f t  is defined as

   .                                                                                                                          (3) 
Equations (2) are identical to the basic equations of linear anisotropic elasticity, which means that the 
viscoelastic solutions of the Laplace transform domain can be obtained directly from the solutions of the 
corresponding elastic problems with the replacement of ijklC  by ( )ijklsC s

, if the boundary of a 
viscoelastic body is invariant with time. This statement is the so-called correspondence principle between 
linear elasticity and linear viscoelasticity [9,10] and is applicable to anisotropic viscoelastic materials. 
By using the correspondence principle and Stroh formalism for two-dimensional linear anisotropic 
elasticity [7,11], the general solutions satisfying the 15 partial differential equations (2) can be written as

complicated problems such as the interface corners between two dissimilar viscoelastic materials, an 
elastic inclusion inside a viscoelastic material, and the simultaneous existence of inclusions, cracks, and 
holes in viscoelastic solids. 
 
Example 1: Interface corners  
Consider an interface corner between two dissimilar isotropic viscoelastic materials (Figure 1(a)). Both 
of the materials can be characterized by a shear relaxation function ( )G t  and a constant bulk modulus  . 
The relaxation function is considered to have the following form

where 0G  and G  are, respectively, the shear moduli at the initial and final states, and parameter   is the 
relaxation time that determines the rate of decay. In this example,

The variations of stresses xy  with time and location are shown, respectively, in Figure 1(b) and 1(c). 
From these figures we see that the stresses calculated by the commercial finite element ANSYS (with 
27326 elements) are discontinuous across the interface and will approach to the solutions calculated by 
the present BEM (with 297 elements). The CPU times of this example are around 6 minutes for present 
BEM and 40 minutes for ANSYS, which shows that the present BEM is not only accurate but also 
efficient.

simultaneously when the hole is approaching to the crack, whereas AIK  and 
B
IK  are decreasing when the 
rigid inclusion is approaching to the crack. In other words, the presence of hole/rigid inclusion will 
enhance/reduce the stress intensity of cracks. It is also observed that AIK  is always lower than 
B
IK  at the 
same situation, and both of them will always increase when the time passes.  
5. Conclusion 
The transformed BEM developed in this paper are applicable for viscoelastic solids containing defects 
such as holes, cracks, or inclusions. The special feature of the present transformed BEM is that no meshes 
are needed along the boundaries of defects, and the meshes along the remaining boundaries can be made 
by relatively rough discretization. To show this special feature, several examples considering defects of 
viscoelastic solids are illustrated in this paper, such as the interface corners between two dissimilar 
viscoelastic materials, an elastic inclusion inside a viscoelastic material, and the simultaneous existence of 
inclusions, cracks, and holes in viscoelastic solids. The results show that the present transformed BEM is 
not only accurate but also efficient.

ABSTRACT 
Usually the mechanical properties of general elastic solids are determined by 
performing standard tests in the laboratory. When the solids are designable or are 
made of constituent materials in micro or nano scale that are not easy to test, a 
suitable model for the estimation of mechanical properties becomes important. To 
achieve this goal, several different approaches have been proposed in the literature 
such as the micromechanics approach for heterogeneous composite materials, the 
molecular dynamics approach for nanomaterials, and the approaches combining the 
concepts of continuum mechanics and molecular dynamics. If the nanomaterials are 
considered, most of the proposed approaches reply on the numerical simulation of 
molecular dynamics or finite element modeling. Very few of them consider the 
analytical modeling. In this paper, an analytical model based on continuum mechanics 
as well as molecular mechanics is proposed to estimate the mechanical properties of 
general elastic solids which may be in macro or micro or nano scale.  
Through the as made experimental state such as the assumed tensile or pure shear 
state, the deformed position of each atom of the test specimen can be determined by 
the theory of elasticity. With the knowledge of the undeformed and deformed 
positions of each atom, the bond distance and bond angles between atoms which are 
essential for the calculation of potential energy in molecular mechanics can be 
obtained. By treating this potential energy as the strain energy of deformed solids, the 
mechanical properties can then be determined through the differentiation of strain 
energy with respect to strains. Verification of the concept and derivation procedure 
proposed in this paper is then made by an example whose analytical solution has been 
provided in the literature such as the Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio for a 
single-walled carbon nanotube. Furthermore, experimental results measured by 
atomic force microscopy and numerical results simulated by molecular dynamics or 
finite element modeling will all be compared to see the appropriateness of the present 
analytical model. The cases of general elastic solids will then be done in our future 
work.
