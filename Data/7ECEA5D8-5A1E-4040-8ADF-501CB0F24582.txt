Abstract:  The design of non-fragile ∞H  state feedback control for a class of uncertain T-S fuzzy 
systems with interval time-varying delay will be considered in this project.  Robust non-fragile ∞H  
control problems are studied to reduce the effect of the disturbance input on the regulated output to within 
a prescribed level.  Parallel distributed control (PDC) methods will be used to finish the design of 
controllers.  By choosing suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and Leibniz-Newton formula, linear 
matrix inequality (LMI) approach is used to design the robust fuzzy state feedback control.  
Delay-dependent criteria will be proposed.  The design for the optimal non-fragile ∞H  state feedback 
control will be proposed to minimize the bounds of disturbance attenuation.  A numerical example will be 
given to illustrate that the improvement of the proposed results. 
 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy system model [1-2] has attracted great interests for control system 
analysis and synthesis.  T-S models give a useful method to represent complex nonlinear systems by some 
fuzzy sets and reasoning.  Time delay phenomena are often encountered in various mechanics, physics, 
biology, medicine, economy, and engineering systems, such as aircraft stabilization, chemical engineering 
systems, control of epidemics, distributed networks, inferred grinding model, manual control, microwave 
oscillators, models of lasers, neural networks, nuclear reactors, population dynamic models, rolling mills, 
ship stabilization, and systems with lossless transmission lines.  On the other hand, The phenomena of 
time delay are often encountered in various practical systems, such as AIDS epidemic, aircraft stabilization, 
chemical engineering systems, inferred grinding model, manual control, neural network, nuclear reactor, 
population dynamic model, rolling mill, ship stabilization, and systems with lossless transmission lines.  
Hence, the stability analysis and stabilization of T-S model fuzzy systems with time delays have been 
studied in recent years [3-6].  In practical systems, the analysis of a mathematical model is usually an 
important work for a control engineer as to control a system.  However, the mathematical model always 
contains some uncertain elements.  In [3-5], robust stabilization problem for fuzzy systems with time 
delays had been considered.  Stability analysis for fuzzy time-delay systems had been studied by 
Lyapunov theory and LMI (linear matrix inequality) approach.  In the recent years, ∞H  control concept 
was proposed to reduce the effect of the disturbance input on the regulated output to within a prescribed 
level and guarantee that the closed-loop system is stable [8].   Depending on whether the stabilization or 
stability criterion itself contains the size or upper bound of delays, stability criteria for fuzzy time-delay 
systems can be classified into two categories, namely delay-independent criteria [5] and delay-dependent 
criteria [4, 6].  Generally speaking, the latter ones are less conservative than the former ones when the 
time-delay values are small.  In [4-5], Lyapunov-Razumikhin stability theory is used to deal the

By the Lemma 1 and Schur complement of [9], the condition 0<∆ ij  in (9) is equivalent to 0ˆ <Ξ ij  in 
(13).  The condition 0<Ξ ij  in (12b) will also equivalent to 0ˆ <Ξ ij  in (13) for all { }nji ,,1, L∈ .  By 
the equation (12a) with the matrix 0<Ξ ij  and ( ) 0=tw , there exists a constant 0>λ  such that

From (10) and (14), we can conclude that the fuzzy system (8) with ( ) 0=tw  is asymptotically stable (p.
