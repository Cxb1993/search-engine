advantages in terms of system miniaturization, power consumption, and scalability. 
Essential to the successful operation and deployment of sensor networks is the 
establishment of spatial information, i.e., position and time, so that all data collection tasks 
can be coordinated. The goal of the project is develop a positioning technique for sensor 
networks so that not only positioning accuracy but also quality assurance can be achieved. 
Different technique for the exploitation of received signal strength and other sensor 
measurements are analyzed and assessed to determine position in a collaborated manner for 
both static and dynamic cases. Experiments based on SOPC and ZigBee modules are setup 
for the verification of the resulting performance. 
 
二、 計劃的緣由與目的 
無線感測網路中，感測節點都具有感測、通訊與計算的能力。在通訊部分，各感
測節點除可提供資料與訊息之傳輸外，另可藉由接收之訊號場強取得與傳送與接收端
距離之觀測量進而據以定位。本研究主要研究提高無線感測網路系統之定位精度與動
態目標追蹤技術。因此，如何建立一高品質的感測或致動網路之空間資訊以利彼此協
調而達到共同之目的即為一重要問題。若無線感測網路系統佈放於室外，此一空間資
訊可藉由全球定位系統取得。但若此一感測網路系統係工作於室內，則由於環境複雜

統之室內定位精度為重點。 
 
除了定位與目標物追蹤法則之發展外，由於在室內環境中其環境複雜度較高且環
境變化的程度較為劇烈，因此在建構室內定位系統時依室內環境之不同，其所相對應
合適之定位法則亦隨之有所不同，所以本研究透過行動節點取得 RSS 訊號量測數據，
並透過 RSS 訊號處理抑制雜訊、使用最佳化與實際量測的方式建立定位資料庫與路

Abstract—In a spread spectrum ranging system such as 
the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), a 
discriminator is used in the code tracking loop to provide 
an error signal for the tracking of incoming signals. 
Typically, the discriminator manipulates several 
correlator outputs to form the error signal.  The design of 
the discriminator is related to the tracking range, bias in 
the estimation of time delay, and variance in time delay 
estimation. In the paper, a multi-objective approach is 
adopted to design the coefficients associated with the 
discriminator to lead to a better performance tradeoff in 
large tracking range, acceptable bias, and small variance. 
It is shown that the multiple-objective problem can be 
attacked via a quadratic/linear programming method, 
rendering achievable bounds in the performance plane. 
Examples with respect to BPSK (binary phase-shift 
keying) NRZ (non-return-to-zero) codes and BOC 
(binary-offset carrier) codes are given to illustrate the 
design approach. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Many radio navigation systems including the GNSS employ 
spread spectrum signaling for ranging and position 
determination. Such systems typically rely on code tracking 
loops or delay lock loops (DLLs) to maintain code phase 
synchronization with the spreading code, see, e.g. [3] [10] [14] 
[17]. Most existing DLLs utilize an early-minus-late type 
discriminator, which is noted for its S-curve characteristic, 
for the generation of an error signal in the synchronization of 
incoming code. Several Fig.s of merit are of interest in the 
discriminator design. The bias in time delay estimation is 
required to be small so that the pseudorange and carrier phase 
errors are minimized in the presence of multipath. Techniques 
for multipath mitigation have been discussed in [4] [6] [12] 
[13] [15] [17]. Additionally, the operating range of the 
discriminator is required to be sufficiently large to prevent the 
code tracking loop from losing lock when the receiver is 
subject to maneuvers. The sensitivity of the discriminator 
output with respect to time delay error is required to be high 
so that the tracking loop is less susceptible to noises. 
Moreover, for ranging codes that may result in multiple 
correlation peaks, the design is required to lead to 
unambiguous [1] [7] [8]. Existing early-minus-late type 
discriminators are generally limited in achieving the

aforementioned objectives. More recently, multi-correlator 
schemes have been investigated for the enhancement of 
acquisition and multipath mitigation performance [5] [10]. 
With the arrival of multi-correlator techniques, the 
discriminator can be designed by combining a set of 
correlator outputs, giving design flexibility in fulfilling the 
above design goals. 
 
In the paper, in an attempt to achieve a balance among bias, 
sensitivity, operating range, variance, and unambiguity, a 
systematic design method for discriminator design is 
presented. Each design requirement is cast as a constraint on 
the design parameters which include the coefficient vector for 
the weighted combination of different correlator outputs and, 
to some extents, the correlator position vector that governs 
the location of the time offset in code generation. It is further 
shown that in accounting for all permissible multipath, the 
continuum constraints can be converted into a finite set of 
linear inequalities in the coherence discriminator case. A 
quadratic programming is then used to solve for the optimal 
coefficient vector, while a linear programming is used to 
establish achievable performance bounds. Moreover, by 
relaxing the antisymmetric conditions in the selection of 
weighting factors, a better performance tradeoff can be 
achieved. 
 
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the 
discriminator design problem to account for various design 
objectives is formulated. In Section 3, a quadratic/linear 
programming design approach is developed for the design of 
the discriminator. Two illustrative examples are then 
provided in Section 4 to assess the effectiveness and 
applicability of the proposed method through three 
illustrative examples. Finally, conclusion remarks are 
provided in Section 5.  
II. PROBLEM FORMULATION 
The main purpose of the paper is to propose a multi-objective 
design approach for the design of the discriminator in a 
GNSS code tracking loop. As the primary concern is to 
investigate the code tracking loop design, the Doppler 
uncertainties and data modulation are neglected. Under these 
assumptions, the incoming signal in the baseband is modeled 
as [2] [8] [10] [13]

In the code tracking loop, the correlator output vector 
[ ]{ }k I Qz j= = +z z z  is used to form the discriminator output, 
wither coherently or noncoherently, so as to provide a signal 
for code synchronization. Fig. 2 depicts the block diagram of 
a code tracking loop which is composed of a set of correlators, 
discriminator, filter, numerically-controlled oscillator (NCO), 
and code generator. The discriminator output, after filtering, 
drives the NCO to adjust the estimate of the time delay. Local 
replica are then generated from the code generator which 
depends on the time delay estimate, as well as the 
arrangement of correlator position vector [ ]{ }kd=d . The 
code tracking loop stabilizes when the discriminator output 
y  stays at zero. Upon which, the expectation value of the 
time delay estimate 0ˆτ  reaches a steady-state value. Key to 
the code tracking loop is the design of the discriminator. 
When the phase can be correctly estimated, a coherent 
discriminator can be used. In this case, the discriminator is 
linear and bears the following form

for some coefficient vector {[ ]}kc=c . In a typical 
early-minus-late discriminator, two correlators ( 2m = ) 
located at  1 2
dd =  and 2 2
dd = − , respectively, are used with 
d  being the correlator spacing and the associated 
coefficients are 1 1c =  and 2 1c = − , respectively. When the 
phase is not known, a non-coherent discriminator is used. In 
this case, the discriminator output is often expressed as a 
quadratic function of z .

I I Q Qy = +z Cz z Cz  (10) 
for some matrix C . For example, the widely used 
early-minus-late power discriminator employs two

dd = −  and the resulting 
coefficient matrix is given by 
1 0

power discriminator, on the other hand, determines its output 
based on three correlators which are located at 1 2

2 0d = , and 3 2
dd = − , respectively and the corresponding 
coefficient matrix is

the discriminator output can also be normalized so that the 
code tracking loop is less susceptible to the variation in 
carrier-to-noise ratio. In this case, the following discriminator 
function can be adopted.

Traditionally, the degree of freedom in the selection of c  or 
C  is seldom explored previously. In the following, a design 
approach will be proposed to design c  or C  in a 
multi-correlator architecture so that the resulting performance 
of the code tracking loop can be enhanced.

III. DESIGN APPROACH 
In this section, the design of the discriminator function will be 
presented. There are many metrics that can be used to 
quantify a discriminator function which is responsible for the 
formation of the S curve.  For the discriminator, when 0δ =  
implies that 0y = , the discriminator is said to be unbiased. 
The bias in time delay estimation, denoted by 0δ , thus 
satisfies 0( ) 0y δ = . The bias 0δ  depends on the design 
parameter vectors c  (or C ) and d  as well as the multipath 
parameter vectors [ ]{ }ia=a , [ ]{ }ib=b , and {[ ]}iφ=φ . One 
design requirement is to achieve a small bias in time delay 
estimation even in the presence of unknown multipath. In 
addition to small bias, another criterion in the design of 
discriminators is to account for the operating range of the 
tracking loop. Suppose that the discriminator function 
 
 
 
In the above inequalities, the unknown variation cosi ia φ  is 
also bounded above by ia , that is, it suffices to investigate 
the worst case behaviors when 0iφ =  (in phase) and iφ π= , 
respectively. Consequently, the two requirements (12) and 
(13) can be recast as 
 0 01 1
( ) ( ) 0,    
                                                            ,

Note that the above two conditions do not prevent the 
function y  from multiple crossovers between 0δ−  and 0δ . 
However, if the discriminator function remains strictly 
monotonic from 0δ−  to 0δ , it can be assured that there is 
only one crossover and, hence, the bias in time delay 
estimation is bounded by 0δ . Such a technique can indeed be 
used to prevent the ambiguity from happening. 
 
The slope of y  around zero δ  governs the sensitivity 
of the discriminator. To achieve a sufficiently high sensitivity 
as stated in the third requirement, it suffices to have

in which 0s  is a chosen lower bound. The function 
'Λ  is the 
derivative of the function Λ  with respect to δ .  
 
The fourth requirement is to increase the operating 
range to avoid the risk of losing lock in the presence of noises 
and interferences. Suppose that both the lower and upper 
bounds 1δ  and 2δ , with 1 0δ <  and 2 0δ > , of the operating 
range are prescribed, the problem can be formulated as to 
ensure that for all δ  such that 1 2δ δ δ≤ ≤ , the following 
condition is satisfied.

where s  is a prescribed non-negative scalar. Typically, the 
variable s  can be selected as zero.  This would then 
guarantee that the discriminator function remains monotonic 
for 1 2δ δ δ≤ ≤ . A more stringent condition can indeed by 
imposed by allowing the bound as a function of δ , creating a 
corridor for the admissible discriminator functions to lie. It is 
also possible to specify the sensitivity requirement for the

 (18) 
Note that the variance is inversely proportional to the 
integration time, carrier-to-noise density ratio, and the square 
of the sensitivity. By choosing 0
Tc R c  as the new objective to 
be minimized, the role of carrier-to-noise ratio and 
integration time are separated from the discriminator-related 
parameters c  and d .     
 
A key observation is that the equalities and inequalities 
so established in (11)--(17) are linear on the unknown vector 
c . In addition, the requirement (18) is a quadratic function of 
c . A quadratic programming problem can thus be formulated 
to minimize the (upper bound of the) variance subject to the 
linear equalities/inequalities. To account for multipath effects, 
the requirements (14)--(17) must be satisfied for all 
admissible multipath parameters, i.e., for all ia  and ib  such 
that i i ia a a− ≤ ≤  and 0 i i ib b b≤ ≤ ≤ . In other words, the 
worst-case multipath effect must be considered in designing 
the coefficient vector c  in forming the discriminator output. 
The problem to be solved becomes a mini-max problem: 
 
 
 
multipath-induced bias is bounded in amplitude, i.e., 
0 0δ δ≤ , and the dynamic stress due to relative motion is 
often modeled as either a step, ramp, or higher-order function. 
In addition, the discriminator block is limited in its operating 
range (between 1δ  and 2δ ). It can then be shown that the 
time delay estimation error is related to the exogenous inputs 
as

Also, let ε  be the steady-state error due to relative motion, 
then a rule-of-thumb condition for the code lock can be 
established as 
{ }0 1 23 min ,δδ ε σ δ δ+ + ≤ −  (26) 
Thus, the achievable variance ( 0
Tc R c  or 2δσ ), bound on the 
bias ( 0δ ), sensitivity ( 0s ), and operating range ( 1δ  and 2δ ) 
are related and cannot be specified arbitrarily. (26) also 
indicates that iterations are needed in determining the 
bounding parameters to ensure a low probability of losing 
lock or long mean time to lose lock. In practice, a set of 
bounding parameters are selected and the resulting variance is 
then assessed for the verification of (26). If (26) is not valid, 
some bounding parameters must be adjusted accordingly for a 
new design. Naturally, when carrier-aiding is used in the code 
tracking loop, the selection of the bounding parameters must 
be adjusted accordingly. 
 
Two performance planes can be used to facilitate these 
design tradeoffs. One is to show the achievable bound on the 
variance versus bias. Another is to establish the bounds on the 
operating range versus bias. The former can be established by 
solving a series of quadratic programming problems of the 
form (19), while the latter can be constructed by a series of 
linear programming problems in which only linear constraints 
(10), (14), (15), (16), and (17) are accounted for. The 
variance versus bias performance plane and the range versus 
bias performance plane will be illustrated through examples 
in the next section.

 The above derivation has focused on the coherent detection 
scheme. Similar formulations can also be made for the 
non-coherent scheme. For simplicity, consider the 
noncoherent scheme in (10) in which the m m×  matrix C  is 
further constrained to be a diagonal matrix with diagonal 
entries kc . Without abusing of notation, the vector c  is used 
to denote the diagonal elements of C  or { }[ ]kc=c . The

Although the expression is rather involved, the constraints on 
the bias, operating range, sensitivity, and monotonicity can

In the quadratic programming stage, a series of optimal 
solutions is determined by decreasing the requirement on the 
time delay bias, 0δ , from 0.5 cT  until the time delay bias 
constraint can no longer be satisfied. Fig. 6 depicts the 
resulting variance versus bias plot, in which the horizontal 
axis is the (upper bound of the) bias in time delay estimation 
and the vertical axis is the resulting cost function 0
Tc R c , 
which is related to the variance in time delay estimation. It is 
known that both bias and variance in time delay estimation 
may affect the code tracking performance. A large bias results 
in a large ranging error and a large variance is likely to 
increase the probability of losing lock. A tradeoff between the 
two competing objectives is immediately observed in the Fig.. 
Two plots are indeed provided in the Fig., one (solid, blue 
line) corresponds to the case that the coefficient vector c  is 
constrained to be antisymmetric and the other (dashed, red 
line) is the result when the antisymmetric condition is relaxed.  
For the antisymmetric coefficient case, the minimal 
achievable bias in time delay estimation is found to be 
0.255 cT . In contrast, the minimal achievable bias when the 
antisymmetric constraint is relaxed becomes 0.042 cT . A 
significant reduction in bias can be achieved by relaxing the 
antisymmetric constraint. Further, the variance of the former 
is also higher than the latter. Hence, when the anti-symmetric 
constraint is relaxed, a better tradeoff between variance and 
bias can be achieved.    
 
To further compare the results with and without 
antisymmetric constraints, two particular designs as marked 
in circles in Fig. 6 are analyzed. The corresponding 
coefficient vectors are tabulated in Columns two and three of 
Table 1, respectively. Fig. 7 depicts the bounds on the 
discriminator outputs as a function of δ . The bounds are 
established by finding the worst-case combination of 
multipath parameters. Thus, any multipath-induced 
discriminator output will lie between the two bounding 
curves or corridor. The corridor remains monotonic from 
0.5 cT−  to 0.5 cT  as expected. A narrower corridor can be 
interpreted as a more consistent characteristic in the presence 
of uncertain multipath. The corridor with antisymmetric 
coefficient (solid, blue line) appears to be wider than the one 
without anti-symmetric constraint (dashed, red line). 
However, the benefits of narrow corridor and better 
variance-bias tradeoff are achieved at the expense of reduced 
sensitivity when δ  is between 1
2 c
T−  and 1
8 c
T− . Fig. 8 
further shows the multipath-induced bias plot of the two 
designs. Using the same correlator position vector, the design 
by relaxing the antisymmetric constraint yields a much 
reduced bias envelope.

0/C N  from 50 dB-Hz to 30 dB-Hz. For the second design, 
the resulting discriminator function output is depicted in Fig. 
11. The first two conditions on slope and range are satisfied. 
Fig. 12 compares the resulting standard deviation of the code 
tracking error (in the unit of cT ) for the two designs. When 
0/C N  is relatively high (say, 50 dB-Hz), the operating range 
can be increased without due sacrifice in tracking error. 
However, when 0/C N  is low (say, 30 dB-Hz), the tradeoff 
between the requirements on operating range and tracking 
error becomes clear.

V. CONCLUSION 
A multi-objective approach is adopted for the design of 
discriminator in the code tracking of GNSS signals. The 
approach leads to not only the design of the discriminator but 
also the performance limitation in the discriminator design. 
Two types of performance planes, namely, variance-bias 
plane and range-bias plane, are used to delineate the 
performance tradeoff in the discriminator design, which aims 
to achieve a balance among bias, operating range, sensitivity, 
and variance. By considering the worst-case multipath effects, 
the achievable bound in the performance plane can be 
determined by solving a series of linear/quadratic 
programming problems. Further, numerical examples have 
been provided to show that by relaxing the antisymmetric 
constraint on the coefficient vector, it is possible to achieve a 
better performance tradeoff.

A paradigm shift in the proposed design methodology 
can be perceived. Previously, as the correlators are 
implemented in either ASIC or FPGA and the discriminators 
are predominantly early-late type detectors, the task of GNSS 
receiver design in code tracking is often equivalent to the 
selection of the loop filter to account for dynamic stress and 
carrier-to-signal ratio. In the proposed approach, it is shown 
that the design of the coefficient vector of the discriminator 
can be conducted together with the design of the tracking 
loop filter. In particular, it is shown that the variations in the 
parameters associated with the tracking loop filter can be 
accommodated in the discriminator design. The adjustment of 
the discriminator parameters can be easily implemented in a 
software-based GNSS receiver. Consequently, a better design 
synergy in meeting robust tracking performance requirements 
when the operation is subject to multipath and variations in 
carrier-to-noise ratio can be achieved.   
 
 The proposed approach only addresses the code tracking 
system. It is known that the frequency/phase tracking system
