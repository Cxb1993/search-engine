of insulated cylinders subjected to rotation and a steady 
uniform weak transverse magnetic field.  The flow 
pattern mainly consists of an axisymmetric part 
combined with a weak nonaxisymmetric part.  The 
axisymmetric flow they discovered is a rigid-body 
rotation similar to the classical Ekman flow.   In 2004, 
Hayat et al. [7] studied the influence of magnetic field on 
an Oldroyd 6-constant magnetohydrodynamic fluid, a 
non-Newtonian fluid.  They employed the Homotopy 
Analysis Method (HAM) to obtain the analytical solution 
corresponding to (a) a steady Couette flow, (b) a steady 
Poiseuille flow, and (c) a steady more generalized 
Couette flow.  Their solution shows a strong dependence 
of the fluid non-Newtonian parameters.  In another 
publication, Hayat et al. [8] also considered two 
infinitely extended non-conducting parallel plates 
between which the same fluid flows under the influence 
of a uniform transverse magnetic field.  Different from 
the upper boundary condition investigated in [7], the 
upper plate considered in [8] oscillates while the lower 
plate is at rest.  Their analytical solution again suggests 
that the magnetic flow field is influenced by the applied 
magnetic field, the material parameters of the fluid, and 
the motion of the upper plate.  In the following year, 
Asghar et al. included heat transfer phenomenon and 
Hall current effect on the flow driven by eccentric 
rotating disks in their study [9].  They were successful in 
obtaining the exact solutions for the velocity, forces, and 
torque exerted by the fluid on one of the disk.  Based on 
their theoretical solution, they found that the Hartmann 
layer increases with the Hall parameter but decreases 
with Ha.  Almost at the same time, Kharicha et al. [10-11] 
investigated the effect of axial magnetic field and 
conductance on the MHD flow enclosed by rotating 
disks.  Their computational work made use of the finite 
volume approach whereas their experimental study 
employed the ultrasound Doppler shift method.  They 
concluded that the conductance of the disks is another 
important parameter greatly influencing the flow field 
next to the flow Reynolds and Hartmann numbers.  Attia 
has attempted problems similar to Hayat’s for Newtonian 
and non-Newtonian fluid but through the means of finite 
difference method [12-16].  Among these work, he has 
taken into consideration the effect of Joule heating and 
viscous dissipation with the inclusion of Hall effect.  He 
found that the Hall effect introduces an additional 
velocity component in the z-direction which is 
influenced by the viscosity but not the thermal 
conductivity.  On the other hand, Velikhov et al. [17] 
applied a radial electric current through an annulus filled 
with liquid metal.  Based on their experiments, 
simulation, and theoretical analysis, they have proven 
that the radial electric current produces an axial magnetic 
field that in turn causes the liquid metal to spin around 
the inner cylinder.  This magnitude of the spinning 
velocity and the strength of the axial magnetic field 
clearly depend on the radial differential electric currents.  
Furthermore, the stability of MHD Couette flow has been 
thoroughly investigated for various rotational and 
magnetic field scenarios [18-22].  
Even though the exact solutions for the Hartmann 
flow and the MHD Couette flow have been achieved for 
more than seventy years, the solution for a MHD 
cylindrical Couette flow has not been reported in the 
literature.  For this reason, the authors would like to fill 
the gap in the literature by theoretically examining the 
steady nature of a magnetic flow between two 
electrically insulated rotating cylinders under the 
influence of a radial magnetic field.   
In the beginning, the governing equations were 
carefully simplified and derived from the relevant 
Maxwell’s equations as well as the Navier-Stokes 
equations.  Through analytical means, the obtained 
equations were then solved simultaneously for the 
profiles of tangential velocity component, the induced 
magnetic, and the induced current density. 
 
3. METHODOLOGY  
3.1  Governing Equations 
The well-known Maxwell’s equations are the set of 
four fundamental governing equations describing the 
physics and behaviors of electromagnetism.  These 
equations are individually known as the Gauss’s law, the 
Gauss’s law for magnetism, the Faraday’s law of 
induction, and the Ampère’s law with Maxwell’s 
correction.  These equations are mathematically given as

For a highly conducting magnetic fluid, it is 
acceptable to assume that the accumulation of electric 
charge is negligible.  This, combining with the Ohm’s 
law, leads to a tremendous simplification of the 
Maxwell’s equations and eventually forms the induction 
equation.  The complete induction equation reads

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
The rotational speeds of the inner and outer 
cylinders are characterized using rotational Reynolds 
numbers which are defined as ( ) /i i i o iRe r r rω ν= − , 
and ( ) /o o o o iRe r r rω ν= − . 
Fig. 1 shows the velocity and induced magnetic field 
profiles between the inner and outer cylinders.  For the 
sake of presentation, the radial coordinate in the figure is 
normalized via a definition of r*=(r–ri)/(ro–ri).  In this 
study, the outer radius is twice the inner radius.  
In this case, the inner cylinder rotates in the 
counterclockwise direction at a constant rotational speed 
corresponding to Rei = 50 while the outer cylinder is 
stationary (Reo = 0).  When the external magnetic field is 
absent, i.e., Ha = 0, the velocity profile approaches that 
of the classical cylindrical Couette flow as expected.  As 
the strength of the radially outward external magnetic 
field is increased, the associated Ha increases and the 
velocity profile begins to deviate from that 
corresponding to Ha = 0.  This external magnetic field 
actually induces within the fluid an electric current 
which then produces the Lorentz force decelerating the 
fluid elements close to the inner rotating cylinder but 
accelerating those next to the stationary outer cylinder.  
Apparently, the external magnetic field has changed the 
velocity profile in such a way that it resembles a plug 
flow.  These velocity profiles are very similar to those of 
the MHD Couette flow [4].  However, it is remarkable to 
point out that for all Hartmann numbers considered here, 
there exists a location (approximately r* = 0.56) where 
the magnitude of the fluid angular velocity never 
changes.  As shown in Fig. 1(b), the strength of the 
induced magnetic field is directly proportional to the 
strength of the external magnetic field.  In these cases, 
the induced magnetic field is in the clockwise direction.  
As Ha increases, the location of the greatest induced 
magnetic field tends to move closer to the inner cylinder 
while it remains zero on both cylinders.  At sufficiently 
small values of Ha, the induced magnetic field profiles 
appear to be somewhat parabolic.  However, as Ha 
increases gradually, the parabolic profile begins to 
deform as its maxima shifts towards the inner cylinder.  
At Ha = 10, part of the profile apparently becomes linear 
as an indication of the influence by the formation of the 
core flow region.  
The velocity and induced magnetic profiles 
corresponding to Rei = 0 and Reo = 100 are shown in Fig. 
2.  Once again, the velocity profiles for Ha = 0 and Ha = 
1 are almost identical.  The velocity component at the 
location far enough from both the cylinders tends to 
become flattened as Ha increases.  As a matter of fact, 
there appears an inner region (r* < 0.58) and an outer 
region (r* > 0.58) within the annular space.  The fluid 
elements in the inner region accelerate with Ha while 
those in the outer region decelerate.  At the location r* = 
0.58, the magnitude of the angular velocity component 
always remains about 0.64.  The induced magnetic field 
in this case has an extremely high resemblance to that 
shown in Fig. 1(b) whose Rei = 50 and Reo = 0, except 
that the direction of the induced magnetic field is 
absolutely reversed.  Since Rei = 0 and Reo = 100 in this 
case, the magnitude of the linear velocity difference 
between the inner and outer cylinders are exactly 
identical to the previous case because the outer radius of 
the annulus considered here is twice of the inner one.  It 
can be deduced according to eqs. (21) that the rotational 
speeds for both these cases are evidently the same.  
However, the relative motion between the cylinders in 
this case is completely opposite to the previous case.  
Based on Maxwell’s equations and Ohm’s Law, it is not 
difficult to expect that the induced magnetic fields for 
these two cases are exactly the same in magnitude but 
perfectly opposite in direction.   
When only the inner cylinder rotates in the 
counterclockwise direction while the outer one remains 
motionless (Rei = 50 and Reo = 0), as shown in Fig. 3, 
the dimensionless tangential velocity component at the 
inner cylinder is equal to unity but the one at the outer 
cylinder is null.  In these cases, the inner cylinder is 
perfectly insulated whereas the outer cylinder is perfectly 
electrically conductive.  Apparently, the velocity profiles 
are totally different from those shown in Fig. 1.  
However, it is clearly seen that the velocity profiles in 
these cases resemble the inner halves of those displayed 
in Fig. 1.  Also found is that the induced magnetic 
profiles are entirely different from those shown in Fig. 1.  
The magnitude of induced magnetic field at the outer 
cylinder wall is no longer absent.  As Ha increases, it is 
found that the minimum induced magnetism takes place 
closer to the inner cylinder.  Not only so, the induced 
magnetism appeared on the outer cylinder grows in the 
beginning when Ha increases to 3.  Then, as Ha further 
increases to 5, the magnetism at the outer cylinder 
reduces with Ha. 
If the inner cylinder remains motionless while the 
outer one rotates corresponding to a Re of 100, it is 
found that, as shown in Fig. 4(a), the velocity profile is 
almost the upside-down of that shown in the previous 
case.  At relatively small values of Ha, the velocity 
variation within the annulus is approximately linear with 
radial distance.  As Ha increases, the velocity component 
close to the outer cylinder grows rapidly while the

3. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS 
Due to the relative motion of the smart magnetic fluid in the magnetic field, electricity is 
induced and it forms a complete electric circuit between the inner and outer cylinders. Very 
similar to Hartmann’s finding, the Lorentz force in a cylindrical flow field is also Ha2 times 
greater than the current density generated as the smart magnetic fluid flows through the external 
magnetic flux. The rotational speed of the inner cylinder is characterized using a rotational 
Reynolds number which is defined as

magnetic field and Reω = 50: (a) velocity profile and (b) induced magnetic profile. 
 
Fig. 2 shows the velocity profiles and the distributions of induced magnetic field for various Ha. 
Unlike the previous cases, the magnetic field is externally applied in the inwards radial direction. 
For this reason, the values of Ha are all less than 0. By comparing Figs. 1(a) and 2(a), it proves 
that the flow patterns are identical. This indicates that the presence of an external magnetic field 
surely unifies the velocity component of the smart magnetic fluid regardless of the direction of 
the external magneti field. As a matter of fact, this is a very important characteristics of smart 
magnetic fluid under the influence of any external magnetic field because the smart magnetic 
fluid always tends to behave like a plug flow whenever there exists an external magnetic field. 
Even though the flow pattern is independent of the direction of the external magnetic field, the 
induced magnetic field is totally opposite of the previous case. From Fig. 1(b), it is clear that 
when the external magnetic field is radially outwards, the induced magnetic field acts in the 
clockwise direction.  However, from Fig. 2(b), the induced magnetic field is in the counter-
clockwise direction when the direction of the external magnetic field is reversed.
