Abstract 
This project studies the piezoelectric problems for a coating hole of various shape embedded in 
an infinite matrix subjected to electromechanical loadings. The electromechanical loadings 
considered in this work include a screw dislocation, a point force, a point charge, a far-field 
anti-plane shear and an in-plane electric field. Each component is assumed to be transversely 
isotropic with hexagonal symmetry and poled in the x3 direction. Based on the complex variable 
and analytical continuation method, the general expressions for the complex potentials can be 
derived in each medium. Numerical results are provided to show the effect of hole shape, the 
material combinations and the loading condition on the electroelastic fields due to the presence of 
the coated film. The image force exerted on a dislocation will be calculated by means of the 
generalized Peach-Koehler formula. The solution proposed here can also be used as a Green’s 
function to analyze the corresponding piezoelectric cracking problems.  
Keywords: Coating hole; Arbitrary shape; Piezoelectric; Screw dislocation 
 
1. Introduction 
Piezoelectric ceramics have been widely used in more and more engineering fields, such as 
electromechanical transducers, thermal sensors, micro power generator and medical ultrasonic 
imaging. However, various types of defects existed in piezoelectric ceramics, such as dislocations, 
cracks, cavities and inclusions, can greatly influence the performance of piezoelectric devices. 
Therefore, the mechanical stress analysis of piezoelectric materials with defects plays an 
important role in understanding the behavior and the performance of these devices. Many 
theoretical studies concerning the piezoelectric medium with defects have appeared in the 
literature. These include the work of Pak [1], Honein et al. [2], Meguid and Zhong [3], Chao and 
Chang [4], Xiao and Bai [5,6], Wu et al. [7], Wang and Shen [8], Jiang and Cheung [9], Sudak

2.1. Antiplane deformation 
In this paper, we consider a coating hole of various shape embedded in an infinite matrix 
subjected to anti-plane mechanical and in-plane electrical loadings (see Fig. 1). The contour of the 
hole is presented by 
 1 2(cos cos ), ( sin sin )x R j x R e jψ γ ψ ψ γ ψ= + = −  (7) 
where 0 1e< ≤ , 10 jγ< ≤  and j is a positive integer. By an appropriate selection of the 
parameters e, j and γ , we can obtain various special kinds of holes, such as circle ( 1j e= = ), 
ellipse ( 1,  1j e= ≠ ), triangle ( 2j = ), square ( 3j = ) and pentagon ( 4j = ). The matrix and the 
coated film are assumed to be transversely isotropic with hexagonal symmetry and poled in the x3 
direction. In a class of piezoelectric materials capable of undergoing out-of-plane displacement u3 
and in-plane electric potential φ , the governing field Eqs. (1) and (2) can be simplified to

where 2∇  is the two-dimensional Laplace operator. 
In order to formulate the interface boundary condition, it is convenient to use a complex 
representation for 3u  and φ  which are grouped as a vector

mapping function transforms the region of matrix aΩ  of the z-plane into the exterior region aS  
of the circle aL  with radius 1aρ >  and transforms the region of coated film bΩ  into the

6. Conclusion 
The piezoelectric problems of a coating hole of various shape embedded in an infinite matrix 
are analyzed in the framework of linear piezoelectricity. Based upon complex variable and 
analytical continuation method, a rapidly convergent series solution which is expressed in terms 
of an explicit general term of the complex potential of the corresponding homogeneous problem 
is obtained in an elegant form. Numerical results are provided to show the effect of interfacial 
stresses, electric field and image force due to the presence of the coated film. Some certain 
piezoelectric constants combination to make the composite perform the larger response of electric 
field is found and can be used to build a relatively effective sensor. Also, some certain 
piezoelectric constants combination to produce smaller stress is found and can be used to protect 
the vulnerable piezoelectric sensor from mechanical damaging in a piezoelectric composite 
material system.

mechanical and in-plane electrical loading in a linear piezoelectric material. Huang and Kuang [21] evaluated the generalized
electromechanical force when the dislocation locates inside, outside or on the interface of the elliptical inhomogeneity in an
inﬁnite piezoelectric medium. Liu et al. [22] dealt with the interaction of a piezoelectric screw dislocation with an interphase
layer between the circular inclusion and the piezoelectric matrix. The aforementioned studies mainly focused on problems
with simple conﬁgurations, such as circular or elliptical shapes. There are only a few papers dealing with other complex con-
ﬁgurations that are more commonly encountered in engineering applications. The in-plane tension and anti-plane bending
of a thin plate containing a rigid polygonal inclusion and a hole in an elastic matrix were studied by Gdoutos and Kattis [23]
and Pengfei and Ishikawa [24] with conformal mapping carried out by an inﬁnite power series. By using the complex variable
method, Savin [25] analyzed the stress concentration around holes of polygonal and quasi-polygonal shape. By using Sch-
warz–Christoffel mapping function, Kachanov et al. [26] investigated the effective properties of solids with cavities of various
shapes. Tsukrov and Novak [27] used the combination of numerical and analytical techniques to obtain the effective elastic
properties of solids with defects of irregular shapes. Ekneligoda and Zimmerman [28] derived a closed-form expression for
the compressibility of an isolated pore in an inﬁnite two-dimensional isotropic elastic body by using the complex variable
method and conformal mapping. Gao and Noda [29] used the Faber series method to investigate the anti-plane problem of an
arbitrarily shaped piezoelectric inclusion embedded in an inﬁnite piezoelectric medium. By means of complex variable
methods and Faber series expansion, Wang and Sudak [30] investigated the interaction between a screw dislocation and
an arbitrarily shaped elastic inhomogeneity with different material properties than the surrounding matrix.
Due to the electromechanical coupling phenomenon, the shape of coated hole and the material combinations will ad-
versely inﬂuence the performance of many piezoelectric devices. This paper investigates the piezoelectric problems of a
coated hole of quasi-polygonal shape embedded in an inﬁnite matrix subjected to electromechanical loadings. The derived
solution can also be used as a Green’s function to analyze the corresponding piezoelectric cracking problems and predict the
growth of Mode III crack. The thin coated layer on the hole proposed in this paper serves two purposes: (a) to increase the
performance of the piezoelectric sensor; (b) to protect the vulnerable piezoelectric sensor from mechanical damaging. It is
the motivation of this paper to understand the strengthening mechanism of piezoelectric devices.
2. Basic equations
In a ﬁxed rectangular coordinates system (x1, x2, x3), the basic equations for linear piezoelectric materials can be written
as
rij;j ¼ 0 ð1Þ
Di;i ¼ 0 ð2Þ
cij ¼
1
2
ðui;j þ uj;iÞ ð3Þ
Ei ¼ u;i ð4Þ
rij ¼ cijklckl  ekijEj ð5Þ
Di ¼ eiklckl þ eikEk ð6Þ
where the repeated indices mean summation and a comma stands for partial differentiation. cijkl, ekij and eik are the corre-
sponding elastic, piezoelectric and dielectric constants, respectively. rij, ui, Di, u, cij and Ei are stress, displacement, electric
displacement, electric potential, strain and electric ﬁeld, respectively.
2.1. Anti-plane deformation
In this paper, we consider a coated hole of quasi-polygonal shape embedded in an inﬁnite matrix subjected to anti-plane
mechanical and in-plane electrical loadings (see Fig. 1). The contour of the hole is presented by
x1 ¼ Rðcoswþ A cos jwÞ; x2 ¼ RðB sinw A sin jwÞ ð7Þ
where 0 < B 6 1, 0 < A 6 1j and j is a positive integer. By an appropriate selection of the parameters B, j and A, we can obtain
various special kinds of holes, such as circle (j = B = 1), ellipse (j = 1, B–1), triangle (j = 2), square (j = 3) and pentagon (j = 4).
The matrix and the coated ﬁlm are assumed to be transversely isotropic media belonging to a hexagonal crystal class 6 mm
[16] and poled in the x3 direction. In a class of piezoelectric materials capable of undergoing out-of-plane displacement u3
and in-plane electric potential /, the governing ﬁeld Eqs. (1) and (2) can be simpliﬁed to
c44r2u3  e15r2/ ¼ 0 ð8Þ
e15r2u3  e11r2/ ¼ 0 ð9Þ
where r2 is the two-dimensional Laplace operator.
In order to formulate the interface boundary condition, it is convenient to use a complex representation for u3 and /
which are grouped as a vector

Suppose a screw dislocation with Burgers vector b and electric potential jump D/ is located at the point f = f0 which is
subjected to a point force p0 and a point charge q0. The solution of the corresponding homogeneous problem can be ex-

Assuming the boundary of the hole is traction-free and charge-free, the boundary conditions of the hole can be stated as

The assumption of perfect bonding between the coated layer and the inﬁnite plane implies the continuities of generalized
displacement and traction across the interface, which leads to the following conditions:

to have the same material constants of the matrix except the piezoelectric constant or elastic modulus. Fig. 15 shows the
distribution of the tangential shears at the points f = qb = 1 and f = qa = 1.1 as a function of the piezoelectric constant ratio.
It is obvious that the tangential shears in the ﬁlm are more sensitive to the piezoelectric constant ratio than the one in the
matrix. Furthermore, the minimum tangential shears in the ﬁlm occur when the piezoelectric constant of the ﬁlm is about
ﬁve times of the piezoelectric constant of the matrix. Fig. 16 showsf the distribution of tangential shears at the point
f = qb = 1 and f = qa = 1.1 as a function of the elastic modulus ratio. It is clear the tangential shears in the ﬁlm increase with
the increasing stiffness of the ﬁlm monotonously.
The image force acting on the dislocation is an important physical quantity for understanding the interacting of a dislo-
cation and inhomogeneities. The image force can be calculated by means of the generalized Peach–Koehler formula by Pak
[16].

6. Conclusion
The piezoelectric problems of a coated hole of quasi-polygonal shape embedded in an inﬁnite matrix are analyzed in the
framework of linear piezoelectricity. Based upon complex variable and analytical continuation method, a rapidly convergent
series solution which is expressed in terms of an explicit general term of the complex potential of the corresponding homo-
geneous problem is obtained in an elegant form. Numerical results are provided to show the effect of interfacial stresses,
electric ﬁeld and image force due to the presence of the coated ﬁlm. Some certain shape of the coated hole to make the com-
posite perform the larger response of electric ﬁeld is found and can be used to build a relatively effective sensor. Also, some
certain piezoelectric constants combination which can adversely reduce the interfacial stresses is found and can be used to
protect the vulnerable piezoelectric sensor from mechanical damaging in a piezoelectric composite material system.
