Abstract
The top-to-down design approach for a
wireless communication system is to integrate
the RF subsystems to provide the desired
function.  For most new applications, there is
no ready-made chip set in the present IC
market, to develop new IC dedicated to the
intended application may lead to unplanned
project delay or may be economically infeasible.
A better solution to get rid of new IC tape-out
is to integrate the hand-on subsystems to work
out the required functions.  Many engineers
have abundant experience in circuit design but
lack system integration concept.  We started
from the simulations of a 915MHz ISM band
short range transceiver, employed system
models to predict the system performance in
advance, and set our goal to provide an easy
design flow to speed up the wireless system
design.  The design case here is useful for
circuit designers to gain system experience with
CAD tool.  It is also ready to be transplanted
to a workshop short course for EPC Gen2
RFID readers.

The basis of wireless RF/microwave
NSC95-2221-E-238-001-4
deployments of its predecessor version, the
first generation protocol.  Gen2 provides
powerful capabilities that may induce widely
adoption of passive RFID.  The important
features included in our system are
numerically simulated by feeding random
number at the input and see the result in
every level.
(1) Backscatter encoding:
The Gen 2 protocol supports two
encoding schemes of the backscatter signal.
FM0 inverts the baseband phase at every
symbol boundary, the power spectrum of
FM0 is found in Figure 1.
Figure 1. Power spectrum of FM0 formatted
baseband signal.
FM0 simply generates the encoded
signal once, it is vulnerable to ambient
interference.  By contrast, the other
encoding scheme, Miller subcarrier,
performs better in the noisy environments
but carries lower data rate.  The slow
attribute makes Miller the substitute for tag
query when FM0 fails.  The Gen2
transceiver reserves the flexibility to choose
either way of backscatter depending on the
how noisy the environment is.  Figure 2
shows the power spectrum of Miller
subcarriers.
Figure 2. Power spectrum for different Miller
subcarrier signal.
(2) Sensitivity:
The receiver performances are not
discussed in the specifications, however,
sensitivity of reader is our great interests.    
The bit error rate of an optimum receiver for
a Miller encoded signal can be written as
÷÷

Q be (1)
where bE  is the bit energy and 0N  is the
single-sided power spectrum of the additive
white Gaussian noise(AWGN).  The
sensitivity S  of the Miller receiver is given
by
)SNRlog(10)NFlog(10)IF_BWlog(10)Tlog(10 sys +++= kS
(2)
where k  is the Boltzmann constant, kT  is the
noise spectral density at 290 K (-174 dBm/Hz),
IF_BW is the IF (pre-detection) bandwidth,
sysNF  is the system (not just the front-end)
noise figure of the receiver, and SNR  is the
signal-to-noise ratio of the receiver’s baseband
signal.  The sensitivity for a bit error rate of
410-=eP  at a 10dB system noise figure is
