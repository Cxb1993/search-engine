binary signal mapper to a conventional turbo 
encoder. The scheme of binary turbo coding 
with interblock memory can also be used to 
construct coded modulation if the binary signal 
mapper is replaced by the signal mapper for a 
modulation constellation.  
A. Encoding 
Fig. 1 shows the encoding structure of turbo 
coded modulation with interblock memory, T, 
where C is the conventional binary turbo code 
[1]. The output of C is split into multiple 
streams, and then each stream undergoes a 
different delay. These streams are linearly 
combined to form T. The code C is constructed 
from a rate-1/3 binary turbo code which 
consists of a K-bit interleaver and rate-1/2 
constituent codes RSC1 and RSC2. An 
arbitrary code rate 3/1>R  for C can be 
obtained by uniformly puncturing the parity 
bits of RSC1 and RSC2.  
Denote the t-th code word of a rate-1/3 turbo 
code word as [ ])(),(),( 21 tptptu , where )(tu  
is the message part and )(1 tp  and )(2 tp  are 
parity parts from RSC1 and RSC2, 
respectively.  
Let )]1,(,),1,(),0,([)( −= Ktutututu L  and 
)]1,(,),1,(),0,([)( −= Ktptptptp jjjj L , where 
),( ktu  and ),( ktp j , j = 1,2, k = 0,1,…,K-1, 
are binary bits. A code word at time t, )(ta , of 
rate-2/3 binary turbo code C , 
)](),([)( tptuta = , where ),0,([)( 1 tptp =  
)]1,(),2,(,),5,(),4,(),1,( 21212 −− KtpKtptptptp L
, can be obtained by uniformly puncturing one 
fourth of parity bits of both )(1 tp  and )(2 tp . 
The turbo coded sequence 
}),1(),(,{ LLr += tataa  is sequentially 
processed by the multiplexer and the delay 
processor to produce the associated output 
sequences }),1(),(,{ LLr += tvtvv  and 
}),1(),(,{ LLr += tstss , respectively,

)],(,),,([),(ˆ 1 ktsktskts mL=  is a binary m-tuple. 
Note that RKm =λ . The sequence sr  is 
then processed by a memoryless signal mapper 
to produce the output sequence ),(,{ tzz Lr =  
}),1( L+tz , where ,),1,(ˆ),0,(ˆ[)( Ltztztz =

a signal constellation consisting of 2m signal 
points. The resultant code T takes z
r
 as its 
code sequence. 
For concise presentation, the indexes t and k 
are omitted in the remainder of this paragraph. 
For a constellation with 2m points, we consider 
a q-level partition, mq ≤ . Let 
miiii qq =<<<<= −1100 L , where ji  is an 
integer. Write ],,[ˆ 1 qs θθ L= , where 
],,,[ 21 11 jjj iiij sss L++ −−=θ . With this, we can 
have a q-level partition chain 
qΩΩΩΩ=Ω //// 210 L , where 1−Ω j  is 
partitioned into 12 −− jj ii  cosets of jΩ  and jθ  
represents one of the 12 −− jj ii  cosets [9-10]. 
Since Ω  is a signal constellation, the distance 
measure )ˆ,ˆ( zz ′Δ is the squared Euclidean 
distance between zˆ  and z′ˆ . Let )ˆ(sω  and 
)ˆ(s′ω denote two signal points which are in the 
same coset of 1−Ω j , but in distinct cosets of 
jΩ labelled by αθ =j and βθ =j , 
respectively. We define ),( βαjΔ  to be the 
least one of all the possible ))ˆ(),ˆ(( ss ′Δ ωω , 
and ),( βαjn  to be the average number of 
signal points )ˆ(s′ω  satisfying 
),())ˆ(),ˆ(( βαωω jss Δ=′Δ .  
Furthermore, let 1)ˆ(),ˆ( −Ω∈′ jss ωω  and 
kiki jj

average number of signal points )ˆ(s′ω

where k is an even integer. 
In T, the code bits of C are split into the 
streams with different delays before being fed 
into the signal mapper. This design allows 
streams with different delays to have different 
levels of protection. Hence, T provides some 
kind of irregularity for the code bits of C. 
Furthermore, we can provide a variety of 
irregularity by considering the construction TC 
which employs various degrees of interblock 
memory. TC is obtained by passing only a 
fraction, PIB, of the code bits of C through the 
delay processor, while the input of the signal 
mapper is the combination of the output of the 
delay processor and the remaining bits of C. 
By varying the fraction, PIB, we can have TC 
with various irregularity and error 
performance. 
we can consider coded modulation 
constructed from various degrees of 
combination of Construction A (or 
Construction B) and the TTCM in [3]. The 
TTCM in [3] is constructed by appending to 
the encoder of a binary turbo code C a 
multiplexer, an interleaver, and a signal 
mapper. The labelling used in the signal 
mapper of the TTCM in [3] is the Gray 
labelling. For Construction A or B with PIB=1, 
the decoding delay is 2K message bits, i.e., K 
8PSK symbols, if IDSC is used. If IDAC is 
used, the decoding delay becomes 3K message 
bits. In general, for Construction A or B with 
PIB =ε , the decoding delay is 2Kε  + (1-ε )K 
message bits if IDSC is used. If IDAC is used, 
the decoding delay becomes 3Kε  + (1-ε )2K 
message bits. For the TTCM in [3], the 
decoding delay is K message bits.  
C. Distance properties 
With the general q-level delay processor and 
the signal mapper, we can check the distance 
properties of the resultant code T in a manner 
similar to that used in [8]. Let 
}),0(),1(,{ LLr vvv −=  be a weight-d binary 
sequence that is the multiplexed version of a 
turbo coded sequence ar  from C. Let zr  and 
0z
r  be the output sequences associated with vr  
and 0
r
 , respectively, where 0
r
 is the all zero 
sequence. Assume 0)( =tv  for t < 0 and 
0)0( ≠v , where 0  is the all zero codeword 
consisting of λ  binary m-tuples. The 
pairwise distance measure ),( 0zz
rrΔ  between 
sequences zr  and 0z
r  is lower bounded by 
∑ ∑= −= Δ=Δ qj k jjjLB kv 1 10 )0ˆ),,0(()0,( λ γrr , where 
j0ˆ  denotes the all zero )( 1−− jj ii -tuple. 
D. Iterative decoding within a single 
codeword (IDSC) 
We illustrate IDSC for Construction A. 
Extension to other constructions is 
straightforward. Fig. 2 shows the relation 
among sequences sr , vr  and ar  for 
Construction A, where ar , vr  and sr  are the 
output sequences of the encoder of C, the 
multiplexer, and the delay processor, 
respectively. Let )(tz  be the transmitted 
word and )(ty be the received word. For 
j=1,2,3, write 
)]1,(,),1,(),0,([)( −= λtvtvtvtv jjjj L . 
Now consider the decoding of )(ta . The 
decoder of IDSC consists of a MAP 
(maximum a posteriori probability) demapper 
and a turbo decoder of C. Suppose the 
extrinsic L-values (or log-likelihood ratios) 
))1(())1(())1(( ,,, −−−=− taLtaLtaL cDpDeD  
of bits in )1( −ta  have been obtained from 
the decoding of )1( −ta , where 
))1((, −taL pD  and ))1((, −taL cD  are the 
associated a posteriori and channel values. 
Step 1 The demapper computes the a 
posteriori L-values ))(( 2, tvL pM  of bits 
in )(2 tv and ))(( 3, tvL pM  of bits in 
)(3 tv , based on the received word )(ty  
and the a priori L-values 
0))1(( 1, =−tvL aM  which can be 
obtained from ))1((, −taL eD . Similarly, 
the demapper computes ))(( 1, tvL pM  
based on )1( +ty  and 
0))1(())1(( 3,2, =+=+ tvLtvL aMaM . In 
 6
from [3] is also performed for comparison. The 
simulation results are given in Fig. 3. From Fig. 
3, we can see that the error performance of 
Construction A or B is better than that of 
TTCM [3] at moderate-to-high SNR not only 
for the same interleaver size but also for the 
same decoding delay. In particular, the 4-state 
Construction A with K = 2048, PIB =4/8 can 
achieve a BER of 10-5 at an Eb/No of 4.3 dB 
and 4.0 dB, respectively if IDSC and IDAC are 
respectively used, while for the 4-state TTCM 
[3] with K = 4096, the associated BER is 
around 2 × 10-5 at Eb/No=4.7 dB. The 4-state 
Construction A with K = 2048, PIB =4/8 can 
achieve a BER of 10-4 at an Eb/No of 4.05 dB 
and 3.85dB respectively if IDSC and IDAC are 
respectively used, while for the 4-state TTCM 
[3] with K = 4096, to achieve BER = 10-4, 
Eb/No=4.3 dB is needed. 
We also observe that the error performance 
at high SNR of Construction A or B can be 
improved by increasing PIB. Construction  A 
or B can achieve much better error 
performance with higher decoding complexity 
by using IDAC as compared to using IDSC. In 
addition, Construction A is suitable for low 
BER (or high SNR) conditions while 
Construction B is suitable for moderate BER 
(or moderate SNR) conditions. 
B. BER results for long code lengths 
We perform BER simulation for 
Construction B with large K to see whether the 
proposed TTCM can achieve the near-capacity 
performance. The simulation results are given 
in Fig. 4. We also perform the analysis of 
EXIT charts [7] to obtain the pinch-off SNR 
limits. The results of BER in the error floor 
region and pinch-off limits are also given in 
Table I. Also included in Table I are the 
simulation results of the TTCM constructed 
from [3]. We see that, Construction B with K = 
262144 can achieve a BER of 3.18×10-8  at 
Eb/No = 3.14 dB which is slightly better than 
the threshold (pinch-off SNR) of 3.15 dB for 
the irregular LDPC-CM given in [5]. In 
addition, the pinch-off limits of 4-state and 
16-state Construction B using IDAC are 3.10 
dB and 3.05 dB, which are only 0.20 and 0.15 
dB from the constraint capacity (2.9 
dB),respectively. 
五、結論與討論(Concluding Remarks)   
In this research, the performance of turbo 
coded modulation with interblock memory is 
investigated. Coded modulation, TC, can be 
constructed based on various degrees of 
interblock memory and decoded by using 
either IDSC or IDAC. Simulation shows that 
for short-to-long code lengths, the error 
performance of turbo coded modulation with 
interblock memory, in general, is better than 
that of the conventional TTCM[3], for 
moderate-to-high SNR. The simulation results 
are confirmed by the analysis of EXIT charts. 
We expect that there is advantage in 
introducing interblock memory to other 
random-like codes such as (irregular) LDPC 
codes, (irregular) RA codes, random coded 
MIMO, etc...
