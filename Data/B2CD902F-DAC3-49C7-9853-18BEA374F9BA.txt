both maximum dimension and thickness variation rate are not sensitive to the film thickness under 
the molding conditions we selected, as values for the 0.2 mm film were only 0~8% higher than for 
the 0.125 mm film. In addition, we also observed that increases in the depth of thermoforming will 
cause wrinkling, especially in the thinner film. Multiple-step thermoforming can reduce the residual 
stress due to the partial relaxation of deformation in each forming stage, and was found to be useful 
in the reduction of warpage and wrinkle in the formed film.

1. Introduction 
3C products (computer, communication 
and consumer electronics) are often designed 
for weight-reduction, thin walls and minimal 
size. As a result, In-Mold Decoration (IMD) has 
become an important manufacturing technology 
for 3C plastic parts in recent years. The in-mold 
decoration process combines injection molding 
and hot-film printing [1]. In this process, a 
plastic sheet or film is printed via a single or 
combination process to obtain the required 
graphic pattern. If 3D forming is required, the 
decorated film is inserted into a thermoforming 
mold. The formed film is then die-cut to fit into 
the mold before injection molding. The molding 
begins when the decorated film is placed into a 
mold cavity. Molding resin is injected behind 
the film, and the film is then separated from the 
supporting layer by temperature and pressure 
and is tightly bounded to the polymer, forming a 
finished integral part [2, 3]. 
Compared to other processes, IMD is a 
relatively new and cost effective processing 
technology widely used in the automotive, 
telecom and plastics industries. It can reduce the 
number of production stages and component 
parts, cutting both production time and cost 
while offering the potential to improve the 
quality, complexity, and durability of finished 
products. Its primary advantage is the 
integration of several manufacturing steps 
(production and decoration of the molding) into 
one production operation [3]. Keypad and 
display modules of the mobile phone and 
automotive panels are the most popular 
application examples. 
Thermoforming is a useful processing 
method in which a heated flat plastic film is 
deformed and shaped into a final part. The 
plastic film is heated above its softening 
temperature and stretched over a male mold or 
into a female mold by applying a direct load or 
pressure difference across the sheet surface. The 
correlation between the contributing parameters 
of the operation and quality features of the 
thermoformed part such as dimensional 
variation and wall thickness distribution is quite 
a complicated issue. 
A number of studies have been 
conducted in recent years to investigate the wall 
thickness distribution of thermoformed parts. 
Pollar et al. [4] reported that plug and film 
temperatures are the major influencing 
parameters of the wall thickness distribution in 
a plug-assisted thermoforming. Aroujalian et al. 
[5], investigated the influence of processing 
parameters, namely film temperature, plug 
velocity, and plug temperature, on wall 
thickness distribution in plug-assisted vacuum 
thermoformed fresh strawberry container using 
high-impact polystyrene. The experimental 
results showed that wall thickness distribution 
was influenced by the plug velocity, plug

depicted in Fig. 1(a). The ink printed area was 
square, with dimensions of 160 mm by 160 mm. 
Afterward, the printed film was dried using an 
infrared conveyor dryer system at a temperature 
of 75°C and a convey speed of 5 m/min to dry 
the printing ink. The film exhibits biaxial 
stretching performance during the forming 
process (Fig. 1(b)). A thermoforming machine 
(F-900-1, manufactured by Cherng-Yuh Co. 
Ltd., Taiwan) with accurate process and heater 
control for the forming process was used in this 
study. The forming system and test film are 
shown in Fig. 2. For dimensional measurement, 
a precision imaging measuring system 
(Micro-Vu Vector Measuring Machine, 
manufactured by Micro-Vu Corporation) 
equipped with 2 micron encodes and the Q-16 
Metrology was used to measure the formed film. 
The thickness distribution of the formed film 
was also measured by a thickness gauge 
(SM-1201LW, manufactured by TECLOCK 
Corporation). In order to understand the effect 
of forming conditions during thermoforming 
processing, a variety of forming parameters 
including mold temperature (85, 100 and 
115°C), film pre-heating temperature (55, 70 
and 85°C), plug speed (20, 25, 30 mm/s), plug 
depth (5, 10 and 15 mm) and plug holding time 
(3, 6 and 9 second) were used in this study. In 
addition to these investigations, another 
important study regarding material properties 
involve stretching ratios, the variation rate of 
film thickness, as well as part surface quality, 
was also discussed via one-step (0 10 mm 
and 0  15mm) and multi-step (0  5  10 
mm and 0 5 10 15 mm) forming. For 
measurement of each variation in dimension and 
thickness, five samples formed under the same 
forming conditions were used. Then the average 
value of the five tested results was used for 
analysis and correlation. The methods of 
measuring dimension and thickness variation 
are described and given as follows. 
2.1  Dimensional Measurement 
In the thermoforming process, the test 
film will be preheated and shaped into the final 
part. At the same time, the grid will be stretched 
and deformed due to forming conditions. The 
line width of the printed marks that were 
designed to measure dimensional variation was 
0.3 mm, while the pitch between line was 5 mm 
(see Fig. 3(a)). The 9 line segments from the 
centre of the bottom-area to the flange-area 
were measured before and after deformation. 
Line segments 1 to 5 are in the bottom-area of 
the part; line segments 6 and 7 are just within 
the sidewall of the part; and line segments 8 and 
9 are located on the flange-area. The percentage 
of dimension elongation can be described by 
%100)(  iijL LLL          (1) 
where L  is the percentage of dimensional 
elongation, iL is the measured distance before 
deformation, and jL is the distance after 
deformation, respectively. In addition, due to 
the line width changing during the forming 
process, each measured line segment 
of iL and jL are subdivided into three sections 
expressed as: 
)22( 21   pppji LLLLL   (2) 
where 2pL and 22pL express half of a line 
width, 1pL is the interval width between the 
two lines, and p = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 
17. 
2.2  Thickness Measurement

mold temperature. As far as the variation rate of 
the film thickness, the values were not 
significantly affected by film temperature, as 
indicated in Fig. 5(b). These experimental 
results are similar to the observed results of 
Aroujalian et al. [5]. Aroujalian et al observed 
that wall thickness and variation factor were not 
significantly affected by film temperature. Lai 
and Holt [9] also observed no effect from the 
film temperature above a minimum softening 
temperature during thermoforming. Furthermore, 
it is worth noting that if the pre-heating 
temperature is ignored, the maximum variation 
rate of film thickness all are around 60% for 
film thicknesses of 0.125 mm and 0.2 mm. 
Figs. 6(a) and 6(b) describe the 
influence of plug depth on stretching ratio and 
film thickness distribution, respectively. It is 
apparent that the higher plug depth results in a 
larger dimensional variation along the sidewall 
region. For a plug depth of 15 mm, the 
stretching ratio can reach approximately 
100~110%. In addition, there is a tendency for 
the maximum values of the stretching ratio to be 
proportional to the plug depth. The ratios are 
approximately 1:2:3 for plug depths of 5, 10 and 
15 mm (also 1:2:3). This result occurs because 
the bottom and flange areas of the test film were 
restricted during the forming stage, subjecting 
the sidewall to tension behavior, leading to 
higher stretching. However, the figures show, 
interestingly, that a plug depth of 15 mm only 
gives approximately 10~20% higher values for 
the variation rate of film thickness a plug depth 
of 5 mm, although the former gives a stretching 
ratio 3 times greater than the latter. Alternatively, 
comparison of the maximum variation of 
dimension and film thickness of the 0.125 mm 
and 0.2 mm films, shows that film thickness 
does not exert a strong influence on these values, 
especially at plug depths of 5 mm and 10 mm. 
The variation of stretching ratios of the 
formed film at various plug speeds (20, 25, and 
30 mm/sec) are shown in Fig. 7(a). These data 
clearly show that a higher plug speed results in 
a smaller stretching ratio on the bottom area, 
sidewall, and flange areas of the formed film. 
Fig. 7(b) illustrates the variation rate of film 
thickness at various plug speeds. As with the 
variation in the stretching ratio, the magnitude 
of the maximum variation rate of film thickness 
(at point 3) also declines with increasing plug 
speed, and more uniform wall distribution was 
obtained. This is probably because viscoelastic 
materials such as plastics approach solid elastic 
deformation behavior at an increasing strain rate 
[10]. Therefore high speed deformation of the 
heated plastic film, during thermoforming at 
higher plug speed, was apparently elastic, 
resulting in a more uniform wall distribution 
due to uniform distribution of the applied stress. 
Similar observations were also made by Shih 
[11] during plug-assist thermoforming of 
amorphous polyethylene terephalate.  
The effect of dimension and thickness 
variation at various holding times on formed 
film is depicted in Figs. 8(a) and 8(b), 
respectively. The percentage of dimensional 
variation of the sidewall, as well as the variation 
rate of film thickness, all appear to decrease 
with increasing holding time. This is because of 
the longer contact time of the test film and 
heated plug will cause the film temperature to 
increase, softening the film. As a result, the 
sidewall was stretched, due to the modulus of 
elasticity decrease. 
In sum, comparison of the values of both 
maximum dimension variation and thickness 
variation between films of 0.125 mm and 0.2 
mm thickness for all processing conditions 
shows that the thinner film gives values only 
0~8% higher than the thicker. This indicates that 
 
 8
Multi-step thermoforming was also applied to 
reduce the residual stress accumulated during 
the forming process, and was found to be useful 
in the reduction of the warpage and wrinkling of 
the formed film, due to the partial relaxation of 
deformation in each stage of forming.
