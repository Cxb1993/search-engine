outstanding localization properties in both the spatial and frequency domain.1-7 However, 
even though the CGWF has many obvious advantageous or even superior properties for 
feature extraction,8-12 its real application area will remain limited if the computational 
heaviness cannot be improved. This drawback can be overcome by using the optical 
architecture for high speed processing due to the inherent parallelism.13,14 However, only 
few studies on optical CGWF implementation were proposed.13,14 In the known optical 
scheme, only the even-symmetrical GWF can be realized. The odd-symmetrical GWF has 
still not been implemented validly by any optical scheme. The odd-symmetrical GWF 
was found important as the even-symmetrical GWF in the applications that need the 
filters in quadrature, for example, filters in quadrature are required to calculate the local 
energy in the novel edge features extraction technique: phase congruency.10 A new setup 
scheme is proposed inspired by overcoming these difficulties optically.  It will be shown 
that the following contributions can be obtained as: (1) A new GCT optical architecture is 
presented. (2) Simple but novel setup scheme can achieve both the even and 
odd-symmetry GWTs based on the proposed GCT. (3) The validity of the mathematical 
derivation is given.  
In order to avoid a complicated device, the lensless Fresnel diffraction is considered 
as the first path transform between the spatial light modulator (SLM) 1SLM  and 2SLM  
as shown in Fig. 1. First of all, the gray-level Gaussian distribution function 
2 2 2 2
1 0 0 0 0( , ) exp ( ) 2 ( ) 2f x y x yµ η ν ξ= − − − −     is written into the 1SLM and located 
in front of the 2SLM and 3SLM , where the coordinates ( , )µ ν  are the central location of 
the Gaussian distribution and the standard deviations ( , )η ξ  determine the spread 
extension of the Gaussian distribution in the 0 0( , )x y  domain, respectively. Before 
 14
where { }2 2 2 216 exp 2 2 ( ) .A f j z f zπ ηξ λ π λ µ ν= + − +    It obvious that the term 
( )2 2 2 2 2 2 22 2exp 2 x y fπ η ξ λ   − + in Eq. (2) is a Gaussian distribution function in the 2 2( , )x y  
domain in which the central location is at 2 0x = , 2 0y =  and the standard deviations are 
equal to  2fλ πη  and 2fλ πξ  in the 2x - and 2y - directions, respectively. Another 
term ( ) ( ){ }2 2 22 2exp 2 2 2j z x f z y f z fπ µ ν λ − + −   indicates the chirp phase 
distribution function with the zero frequency location at 2 2( , ) (2 , 2 )x y f z f zµ ν= . 
Eventually, the Gaussian distribution function is multiplied with the chirp phase 
distribution function in Eq. (2) that becomes the so-called GCT. Consequently, the GCT 
based on Eq. (2) can be implemented by the proposed optical system actually. 
Furthermore, when 2 2x f zµ<<  and 2 2y f zν<< , the CGWF also can be 
achieved using the GCT approximation based on Eq. (2) as

kernel and the complex sinusoid (oriented phase function), respectively. Since the CGWF 
is defined as a certain input object 2 2( , )g x y  convolutes with the product of a Gaussian 
kernel times a complex sinusoid,8, 9 evidently, the result from Eq. (3) actually coincides

To demonstrate the correctness and plausibility of the proposed scheme, a simulation 
is employed. For a certain input object 2 2( , )g x y  as shown in Fig. 3(a) which is prepared 
to be filtered by the proposed CGWF. The oriented feature extractions based on the 
proposed scheme, the six orientations are selected, o0θ = , o30θ = , o60θ = , o90θ = , 
o120θ = , and o150θ = . The resulting edge feature extraction images (bandpass filtered 
images) using the proposed even-symmetrical GWFs for the six orientations are shown in 
Figs. 3(b)-(g). Figures 3(h) to (m) are the results for the oriented edge features extraction 
using the proposed odd-symmetrical GWFs for the six orientations. From the simulation 
example results for the oriented edge features extraction show that the proposed optical 
scheme can actually perform the CGWF well.
