Abstract  
Force regulation is a challenging problem for robot end-effectors when interacting with an unknown 
environment. It often requires sophisticated sensors with computerized control. This paper presents an adjustable 
constant-force mechanism (ACFM) to passively regulate the contact force of a robot end-effector. The proposed 
ACFM combines the negative stiffness of a bistable mechanism and positive stiffness of a linear spring to generate a 
constant-force output. Through prestressing the linear spring, the constant-force magnitude can be adjusted to adapt 
to different working environments. The ACFM is a monolithic compliant mechanism that has no frictional wear and 
is capable of miniaturization. We propose a design formulation to find optimal mechanism configurations that 
produce the most constant force. A resulting force to displacement curve and maximal stress curve can be easily 
manipulated to fit a different application requirement. Illustrated experiments show that an end-effector equipped 
with the ACFM can adapt to a surface of variable height, without additional motion programming. Since sensors and 
control effort are minimized, we expect this mechanism can provide a reliable alternative for robot end-effectors to 
interact friendly with an environment.

An Adjustable Constant-Force Mechanism for Adaptive End-Effector Operations  
 
3
This paper aims to develop an adjustable constant-force mechanism (ACFM) for end-effector force regulation 
applications. The proposed one-piece ACFM differs from previous work in that it is friction-free, scalable, and 
provides force adjustability. The ability to adjust the constant force magnitude is especially important to adapt to 
various applications. This ACFM is to be placed between an end-effector and robot arm to regulate force in 
unknown environments. In what follows, the constant-force curve is first characterized with previous design results 
presented. An optimization formulation is presented to design the configuration of the ACFM; the aim is to create a 
sufficient displacement range that has a reaction force as constant as possible. A prototype is fabricated and validated 
experimentally. Finally, the ACFM is moved along a cam profile to illustrate its constant force adjustability.

2. CHARACTERIZATION OF A CONSTANT-FORCE CURVE AND PREVIOUS DESIGN RESULTS  
Fig. 2(a) shows the reaction force to input displacement (F-Δ) curve of a spring and Fig. 2(b) of a CFM. A 
typical spring produces an output force the magnitude of which is proportional to the input displacement. A CFM, on 
the other hand, generates a nearly constant output force over a range of input displacements. Ideally, the 
constant-force range should be flat as indicated by the solid line. However, actual elastic mechanisms do not fully 
follow the ideal F-Δ curve. There are maximal and minimal peaks that fluctuate the curve. This is similar to the 
structural snap-through buckling behavior, except the goal here is to reduce the gap between the peaks. To obtain a 
reasonable constant-force (operational) region, we first characterize the F-Δ curve of a CFM in Fig. 2(c). Without 
violating the stress limit, a given input displacement Δ = an includes the preload region from 0 to a1 and the 
constant-force region from a1 to an. In the constant-force region, the average force is denoted as the constant force Fc 
and flatness defined as the percentage of the minimal force Fmin divided by the maximal force Fmax. A CFM can be 
obtained by manipulating a nonlinear spring shape so that its F-Δ curve exhibits flatness in this region. Flatnesses of 
more than 95% are necessary for practical uses. 
To analytically design a CFM, a direct approach is to set up an optimization with objective to maximize the 
flatness in Fig. 2(c). This has been implemented in Refs. [5, 15]. Using this approach, a monolithic CFM has been 
presented in our previous work [19] in order to eliminate friction caused by moving joints. Fig. 3 shows the drawing 
of the CFM. It was optimally designed based on the concept derived from that in Fig. 1(b), except that coil springs 
are replaced by homogenous slender beams. The beams have in-plane thickness 0.85 mm and out-of-plane thickness 
10 mm. The CFM consists of two symmetric parts separated by 5 mm. With input displacement Δ = 13.6 mm given

can be made very small to increase the share of the constant-force region. Second, the snap-through portion b to c is 
naturally a very lengthy straight line. Therefore, a long and flat portion d to e can be easily achieved.

3.2 Bistable Beam Design By Using Second Order Segments 
Key to the ACFM is that portion b to c of the bistable beam is as linear as possible with a negative stiffness that 
matches with the positive stiffness of the linear spring. Design concepts of bistable beams are extensively found in 
the literature (e.g., Refs. [20~22]). To create an F-Δ curve such that its combination with the linear spring yields a 
constant-force region, we need to optimize the bistable beam initial shape. Considering the schematic in Fig. 7, the 
symmetric right half of the beam is divided into three parametric segments (with lengths L1 to L3) enclosed in a 
rectangular design boundary. The segments are mathematically separated by four nodes (n1 to n4), where slopes at n2 
and n3 are not necessarily continuous. An un-deflected segment is described by a shape function η(u), where u [0 1] 
is a non-dimensional arc length along the segment and η measures the angle of rotation along u. Using a second 
order polynomial, the shape function of the ith segment is represented as 
  20 1 2( )i i i iu c c u c u     (1) 
where coefficients ci0~ci2 decide the shape of the ith segment. Details of beam and shape model are in Ref. [23].

w = 0.6 mm (In-plane thickness) t = 6 mm (Out-of-plane thickness)
δ = 17 mm [Lx Ly] = [25 7] mm (Domain size)
  
The optimization is formulated in Eqs. (2~3). The objective in Eq. (2) aims to match the values of Fmax and Fmin 
such that the combined force curve is as flat as possible. Apparently the coefficients ci0~ci2, node positions, and 
stiffness k are the design variables. There are nine constraints in Eq. (3) to ensure convergence and that the 
converged optimal shape is feasible. To confine the dimension of the bistable beam, constraints g1~g3 limit the node 
positions within the rectangular design boundary. Constraints g4~g6 restrict the angle difference of neighboring 
segments at each node, so as to avoid manufacturing difficulties. Constraint g7 ensures a minimum segment length to 
avoid singularities. To further prevent each segment from intersecting itself and with others, constraint g8 limits the

For the design in Sec. 3.2, using shape functions of order higher than two results in limited improvement. From 
various manufacturing perspectives, it would be better to have a bistable beam that consists of simple shapes. Since 
the last two segments (L2 and L3) in Fig. 8 resemble an arc and the first (L1) resembles a straight line, we redo the 
case of an = 7 mm by using arc and straight-line segments. Fig. 10 shows the schematic. The arc corresponds to η = 
c0 + c1u of the shape function while the straight line corresponds to η = c0. Other design parameters are the same as 
those in Table 1. The optimization objective is identical to that in Eq. (2). The constraints are also the same as those 
in Eq. (3) except that there are only two segments instead of three. 
Fig. 11 shows the optimized bistable beam shape and Fig. 12 shows the corresponding F-Δ curves. The 
numerical results are in Table 3. Table 4 compares the constant-force properties with those in Sec. 3.2. The achieved 
constant force of using arc and line is comparable to that of using second order segments. The maximal stress curve 
in Fig. 12 increases until Δ = 7 mm, which has a stress of 44.3 MPa. The equally good result of using arc and line is 
not surprising. The proposed ACFM converts the CFM design problem to a bistable beam design problem. The 
design of bistable beam is often easier because it requires a simpler topology and less complicated beam shapes 
when compared with the approach in Sec. 2.

3.4 Linear Spring Design 
The success of the ACFM relies on a linear spring to even the negative stiffness. To meet the precise stiffness 
requirement, a suitable ready-made spring may not be available. Rather, we propose a planar spring that has a

displacement is applied at the triangular tip. Fig. 16 compares the FEA and GMSM results. The FEA curves are all 
slightly higher than the GMSM ones. The maximal difference is 1.74 N at Δ = 2.22 mm and Δa = 10 mm. The linear 
spring has stiffness 1.2011 N/mm, which is slightly higher than GMSM simulation (1.1362 N/mm). The above two 
differences are due to the use of solid geometry (FEA) and line geometry (GMSM). Line geometry does not 
consider the effect of overlapping beam thicknesses (e.g., n2 of bistable beam) and corner fillets at n1~n3. On the 
other hand, solid geometry considers these effects and thus has a higher flexural rigidity. Nevertheless, the FEA 
curves still show very good flatness (94.6% at Δa = 0 mm), indicating that the constant-force property is not sensitive 
to modeling imperfections. The maximum possible adjustment for the spring is Δa = 13 mm (need extra 7 mm for the 
F-Δ curve), where the constant force can be more than 2.5 times the magnitude without adjustment.

4.2 Practice Consideration: Invariance of the F-Δ Curve  
When using the non-dimensional shape functions in Table 2 or 3 to describe the ACFM, the form of the F-Δ 
curve is invariant provided the ratio Lx/Ly is unchanged. Hence the ACFM can be scaled up or down to adjust the 
length of constant-force region. Moreover, the composition of the flexural rigidity EI can be adjusted to manipulate 
the constant force (Fc) and the maximal stress. These offer two advantages such that the optimized ACFM can be 
modified to applications at various scales without performing another optimization. First, the constant force can be 
adjusted to a specified value by using the following formula: 
2 2
1 1 1 2 2 2c x c xF L EI F L EI  (5)
where subscripts 1 and 2 denote the original and adjusted parameters, respectively. To obtain a specified constant 
force Fc2 from the original ACFM, the values of EI2 and Lx2 must be changed to match with the specified Fc2. Among 
them, the length Lx2 is adjusted by dimensionally scaling the whole ACFM without changing the ratio Lx/Ly. The 
flexural rigidity EI2 is adjusted by varying the in-plane thickness w, out-of-plane thickness t, or material (E). Note 
that changing in-plane thickness would as well change the maximal stress curve; changing material would change 
the yield and allowable stress. These in return alter the allowable input displacement. 
Secondly, it is possible to move the maximal stress curve downward without changing the F-Δ curve. Thus the 
ACFM has a smaller stress curve and a more conservative safety factor can then be applied under the same 
displacement. The maximal stress σm may be reduced by narrowing the in-plane thickness w (σm is proportional to w). 
To keep the flexural rigidity and thus the F-Δ curve unaffected, the out-of-plane thickness t must be increased. As an 
illustration, the in-plane thickness w is multiplied by 0.85. The out-of-plane thickness t must be multiplied by 1.63 to

5. EXPERIMENT VALIDATIONS 
The prototype in Fig. 15 is validated by performing experiments to obtain the actual F-Δ curves. The ACFM 
assembly is shown in Fig. 20. The monolithic ACFM is mounted on an aluminum rig. There is a linear guide to 
constrain the ACFM (includes the end-effector, bistable beams, and linear spring) to move only in the axial direction. 
A stepper motor provides the adjustment force. Two different load experiments are conducted. The first is a load 
along the axial direction. This load matches with the design requirement in Sec. 3. In practice, the end-effector 
moves laterally along a surface on which both axial and lateral forces present. The second experiment studies the 
constant-force behavior upon this type of loading.  
5.1 ACFM with Axial Load  
As shown in Fig. 20, a force sensor (FUTEK LSB200) approaches the tip of the ACFM from Δ = 0 mm in order 
to measure the axial reaction force. The force sensor compresses the ACFM with a Δ = 7 mm displacement and then 
decompresses to Δ = 0 mm. Fig. 21 shows the compression curves with respect to Δa = 0~10 mm. The test at each Δa 
was repeated three times to obtain the error bars. As shown, the force curves at each Δa achieve very good flatness. 
The flatness is 92.6% at Δa = 0 mm. The maximal standard deviation of the repeated measurements is 0.396 N and 
occurs at Δa = 10 mm. The deviation results from material stress relaxation. Fig. 22 shows the corresponding 
decompression curves. The hysteresis gap between each pair of compression and decompression curves is roughly 
0.5 N. Fig. 23 further plots the relation of constant force Fc (average between Δ = 2 to 6 mm) versus the adjustment 
length. The relations are fitted as linear functions, where the slopes indicate the actual spring stiffness. Compared 
with the FEA result that has relation Fc = 1.20Δa + 9.42, the experiment results exhibit slightly smaller spring 
stiffness. The inconsistencies between simulation and experiment are primarily a result of fabrication and material 
property imperfections. Nevertheless, the adjustable force curves in Figs. 21~22 are not sensitive to these 
imperfections and still show very good flatness. 
Note that all the force curves in Fig. 21 start at F = 0. This is different from those in Fig. 6(f) and Fig. 16 in 
which the adjusted force curves start at F = Fa. In the experiment, the stopper maintains the end-effector original 
position subjected to various adjustment forces. Hence the approaching force sensor has reading that starts from zero 
and then rapidly increases to Fa and above. This experiment setting only slightly affects the preload region and has 
no effect on the constant-force region.

show the force curves of using the roller end-effector with and without preload, respectively. At different adjustment 
lengths, the end-effector also exhibits constant axial forces. The geometric difference between knife-edge and roller 
results in different pressure angles at the contact point. The roller experiences a smaller pressure angle and thus a 
smaller lateral force. At Δa = 10 mm, the knife-edge has maximal 15.9 N lateral force while the roller has maximal 
11.1 N lateral force (without preload). Both lateral forces are much smaller than the corresponding axial forces. 
5.3 Discussions 
Although we illustrate using a cam profile with 4 mm height variance, the ACFM can adapt to various profiles 
as long as two requirements on profile geometry are met. First, the profile height cannot be too large such that the 
ACFM operates outside the constant-force region. In addition, the pressure angle between cam profile and 
end-effector should be kept below a reasonable limit (say, 45°) in order to avoid excessive lateral forces. 
The simulation and experiment results showed that the constant-force property is not sensitive to modeling and 
manufacturing imperfections. Even when the surface is not rigid (e.g., human body), the constant-force property is 
still valid as long as the ACFM operates in the constant-force region. Without an ACFM, an extra actuator is 
required to raise the end-effector to prevent jam. This may bring in a controller to regulate the contact force, not to 
mention the overshoot and stability problems introduced by active control. On the other hand, our proposed ACFM 
only requires a passive mechanism to adapt to the working surface with a specified force magnitude.

Abstract 
The purpose of this trip is to present a research paper in the 2011 IEEE International 
Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) held in Shanghai, China. The 2011 
ICRA consists of numerous multidisciplinary technical conferences. More than 2102 
papers were received but only 984 papers made to the final technical program. The 
acceptance rate is about 49%. There are also several keynote lectures, 
tutorials/workshops, and forums. This is a very big conference where you can meet 
scholars from different backgrounds. 
 
The title of my paper is “Design of Adjustable Constant-force Forceps for 
Robot-Assisted Surgical Manipulation”. This paper belonged to the “Medical robots 
I” session on the first day (May 10, 2010) of the conference. The research focus of 
medical robots this year, from my observation of other presentations, was on the 
implementation of articulated joints for minimally invasive surgery. I have also 
participated in several related sessions and found some of the topics interesting and 
inspiring. 
 
Finally, I would like to thank National Science Council of Taiwan for supporting my 
travel. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
目的與過程 
The purpose of this trip is to present a research paper in the 2011 International 
Conference on Robotics and Automation held in Shanghai, China. The title of my 
paper is “Design of Adjustable Constant-force Forceps for Robot-Assisted Surgical 
Manipulation”. The abstract of this paper is provided as follows. 
Force regulation is a challenging task of forceps used for robot-assisted surgical 
manipulation. To avoid excessive force applied on soft tissues, sophisticated sensors 
with computerized precise control are often required. Without using additional 
electronic elements, this paper presents a passive mechanism to maintain a constant 
contact force between forceps jaw tips and tissues given a pre-specified force 
magnitude. The mechanism consists of symmetric flexible structures specifically 
designed to generate a constant torque regardless of input rotation. The constant 
torque is converted to a constant force through an adjustable lever arm. When the 
force is further transmitted to jaw tips, it keeps a nearly constant contact force 
regardless of tissue stiffness and size. After a formulation to find the optimal 
mechanism configuration, the design is verified by comparing with experiment and 
simulation results. A prototype of the adjustable constant-force forceps is finally 
illustrated and discussed. The novel forceps is expected to serve as a reliable 
alternative for robot-assisted surgeries. 
 
straightforward, at the same time the two major problems can be solved. My students 
and I are aiming at developing a design of this kind of actuator and we believe it can 
one day be a better design and even outperforms existing ones.  
I have also participated in several related sessions and found some of the topics 
interesting and inspiring. This is the third year that I attend this conference since I 
come back to Taiwan. This is a very good conference and I will continue to attend this 
conference if there are available travel grants.
