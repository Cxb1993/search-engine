 計畫中文摘要 
由於全球化所導致的經濟高度分工，國內企業無不積極進行轉型，開始專注於產品的
研發設計，藉由創新開發來持續保有其競爭力。然而僅利用供應鏈管理降低生產成本的手
段已無法滿足現今之營運需求，取而代之的是設計鏈資源的有效整合，以因應產品不斷提
高的複雜度與日漸縮短的生命週期。對於新產品開發而言，產品結構的優劣至為關鍵，不
僅決定了設計功能的品質，亦直接影響設計鏈與供應鏈管理之各項決策，故如何透過產品
結構之調整，提高產品價值鏈的整體效能為現今企業之首要課題。以往文獻尚未有較為嚴
謹之定量分析，能夠在滿足功能需求的前提下允許產品結構自動變異，因此無法充分利用
設計階段的自由度來改善價值鏈的效率。有鑑於此，本研究針對產品結構的建立過程進行
探討，已成功提出一套創新性之定量方法論來評估產品結構設計，藉此將設計鏈與供應鏈
的決策因素整合至系統設計階段，幫助企業在開發新產品時，能夠快速找尋合適之既有零

四種變異方式，利用遺傳演算法將零件組合轉換成一系列合理之產品結構方案，其結果為

壹、前言 
產品結構為開發過程中極為重要卻又常是被忽略的一環，其主要意義是於系統設計
階段顧客功能需求決定產品包含之功能件、採用的材料製程，與功能件於空間中的相對
位置、彼此的接合方式與模組化的考量等。此外，相異產品結構亦將決定後端供應鏈上
績效優劣，不論企業組織形態、製程規劃、供應商選擇、零組件的裝配\拆卸步驟，甚至
產品生命終了之回收處理等均與其習習相關[Stone et al., 2004]，如圖 1 所示。 
 
 
圖 1 產品結構於不同範疇之影響 
新產品的規劃與實現過程，通常利用市場需求形成產品概念，再藉由定義產品功能
需求確立產品概念結構。其次則將功能進行分解形成多個子功能組合，建構出抽象的產
品功能結構。最後再分別指定個別模組之特定功能，經由數個功能模組的結合，完成實
體的產品結構，指引後續細部設計作業的進行[Mikkola & Gassmann，2003]。 [Ulrich, 2000]
定義產品結構為將產品功能元素與實體零件對應之組合關係，同時必須確立不同組件間
之功能及其介面關係。前者為實質上可區分的單位，而後者則是主導產品結構的關鍵因
素。 
根據以上描述可知產品結構並非單純之物料清單(BOM)，擁有相同功能的產品可以
有許多不同的產品結構(圖 2)，除了最終產品之次組件與構成零件的選擇，亦必須考量功
能需求與品質相關議題。而隨著協同概念的興起，產品結構的意義也就不僅侷限於前端
的設計，還決定後端生產規劃、資源分配、供應鏈與物流管理，故產品結構管理對於企
業而言至為重要[Clark & Fujimoto, 1991]。尤其在協同產品開發環境下，如何利用產品結
構的調整有效整合設計鏈上的資源更為關鍵，例如促使零件利用率提升，透過標準化或
模組化選擇設計供應商，提高 NPD 專案績效或設計變更傳遞的簡化等均與其密切相關
[Chu et al., 2006]。

然而上述關於產品結構的文獻多半藉由定性分析找出較佳的產品結構組合，或是假
設結構已知的情況下評估相關影響，尚未有較為嚴謹的定量分析方法，能夠在滿足設計
功能需求的前提下允許產品結構自動的變異，藉此進行開發過程的最佳化。有鑑於此，
本研究將提出一創新性計算架構，結合產品工程與 CAD 技術，提供有效的定量模式來充
分運用設計自由度，藉此進行產品結構的自動變異，並搭配基因演算法考量不同決策因
子，進行開發價值鏈之整體性最佳化。 
圖 3 為本論文之研究概念圖，目的在於協助企業在得知顧客需求時，僅需藉由輸入
產品所需之功能元素及組裝相關限制下，系統將於零件資料庫中搜尋符合顧客需求之零
件或模組化之組件，且利用 CATIA 軟體判斷零(組)件間組裝特徵與介面關係，以進行自
動化組裝動作，同時考量零件組裝相容性。第二階段則配合基因演化計算評估不同產品
結構之績效，藉由其演化過程逐步改善原有之結構設計最後得出一最佳產品結構。 
 
   
 
圖 3 本研究概念圖之示意 
參、自動化產品結構變異機制 
產品結構的變異方式甚多，如利用不同零件加以組合搭配而成、修改部份零件設計
參數使之能符合需求功能，或是直接設計全新零件等。本研究目的在於克服傳統上產品
結構建立過程的限制，建立一套自動化結構變異機制。主要作法為利用功能元素與組裝
限制關係尋找合法之產品結構，圖 4 為提出之結構變異流程，將整合零件組合、組裝順
序、組裝介面及設計變更四種變異方式。該機制先利用零件組合變異選取符合功能需求
之零件集合，並利用組裝順序建立產品樹狀結構，而組裝介面選擇可決定零件組裝完成
之外觀，最後再依照選擇不同組裝方式而進行零件設計變更考量。不同於以往利用草圖
聯想或腦力激盪的定性方式，利用此變異機制將能創造出各式各樣可能之產品結構，激
發工程師在設計時之額外創意來源，增加更多產品創新的機會。該方法亦能有效幫助決
策者在進行新產品開發時，僅藉由輸入所需功能即能得出符合組裝次序之產品結構組
合。再配合不同績效指標即能進行產品結構最佳化之後續評估，完成最符合公司利益的
5 
限制，找到一個較理想的裝配次序。其建立方式主要受限於兩零件間介面是否能相互配
合，以及產品零件間的先行關係順序[Lambert, 2003]。零件先行關係指零件組裝先後順序
的限制，如圖 6 中若 P3 與 P4 先進行裝配，則將造成之後 P2 無法與該子組件進行裝配。
而介面配合取決於組裝介面上之特徵形態，將於組裝介面選擇變異中再進行深入探討。
然而隨著零件數量的增加，可能的組裝順序將會大幅上升，所產生之可能子組裝件數量
形態亦隨著增加，故需記錄所有可能之組裝件組裝特徵，藉此避免發生判斷錯誤的情況。
且在產品開發過程中，一旦發生設計變更時，組裝順序亦需再重新調整計算，大幅提高
其計算的複雜度。故本研究利用基因演算法中其交配(Crossover)與突變(Mutation)方式變
異裝配順序，再藉由演化過程求出最佳之產品結構方案。 
 
圖 6 不同組裝順序所產生之相異產品樹狀結構 
三、組裝介面選擇變異：實際的工程設計中允許的組裝方法甚多，例如利用螺栓、公差
緊配、焊接或黏合等方式。但在零件細部設計初期並非採用上述文字敘述的方式考量，
而是透過在 CAD 環境下以幾何關係為主之「組裝特徵」來描述零件組裝過程，包括了共
軸、共面、夾角與間距等不同的組裝約束。不同的 CAD 系統中所採用組裝約束型態可能
亦有差異，為簡化問題但同時保持方法論的創新，本研究以 CATIA V5 軟體系統為實作
環境，利用二種較為常用之組裝特徵進行分析，分別描述如下： 
¾ 軸對稱組裝特徵：指零件設計特徵間以對稱軸對齊的方式進行約束(圖 7)，預期將先
考慮包含凸出特徵(I)、凹陷特徵(O)與穿透特徵(T)之間的組合問題。 
¾ 面貼合組裝特徵：指兩零件根據特定之面相互貼合，以字母 F 表示。

圖 9 組裝介面選擇變更 
透過上述組裝特徵與組裝介面定義，配合 CAD 系統中建立特徵對應法則及以座標轉
換的方式，可判斷兩零件介面之組裝特徵及其位置是否能相互對應並進行組裝。由圖 9
中可發現即使擁有相同之零件組合及組裝順序，選擇相異組裝介面亦可能造成產品外觀
的不同，增加產品結構設計變異可能。 
四、零件設計變更：在此設計變更為判斷若使用不同組裝方式是否影響原介面特徵設計，
因而需再進行介面特徵變更判斷，並假設其變更過程不影響零件功能。本研究共採用緊
配、焊接及黏合三種組裝方式，其中緊配又包含螺紋與利用卡栓緊配兩種。根據不同組
裝方式，系統將直接利用 CATIA 所提供之 API 自動進行三維零件設計修改，其變更方式
如下(圖 10)： 
¾ 緊配：採用緊配組裝方式時，需視兩零件相互配合之組裝特徵形式進行變更。組裝
特徵對應及組裝方式的不同將會有相異之設計變更可能，如兩個穿透特徵對應螺紋
時，則穿透特徵需變更成螺紋特徵形式；若採用卡栓緊配則無需進行設計變更。 
¾ 焊接及黏合：當兩零件進行此種組裝方式時，則需視零件組裝介面上所採用之特徵
是否被其他零件以緊配的方式組合，若無，則可刪除該特徵以降低製造成本。

採用之染色體編碼須表示出對應之產品結構(包含零件組合及組裝順序)，以及相關績
效決策因素(供應商選擇及組裝方式選擇)，故本研究以二階編碼方式達成上述需求，其編
碼方式如圖 13 所示，在產品結構編碼矩陣中，數值為 1 代表同一行之零件需與下一零件
進行組裝(如 P1 與 P2 裝配)，若該零件已於上一階層組裝，則利用對應組件與下一零件
進行裝配(如圖中之 A1 與 P3)。

伍、研究結果實作範例 
一、演算法環境及實作結果 
本研究採用 CATIA V5 之 CAA  V5R15 結合 Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 sp6 進行系統
實作。透過 CATIA 所提供之 API 進行零件資料格式存取設定、組裝特徵自動化修改、組
裝相容性判斷以及產品視覺化效果呈現，並以三維機械手臂為例，驗證藉由產品結構的
變異將能有效降低產品開發成本，提升整體開發鏈之效率。 
二、情境模擬 
假設 A 公司已設計該機械手臂，其具備 F1-F6 之所有功能，對應之產品結構設計與
最佳化後的績效結果如下圖所示。

若公司欲再開發擁有相同功能之機械手臂，自動化產品結構變異系統將可快速尋找
符合顧客需求之舊有設計之零(組)件，同時產生多種產品結構設計。此外隨著演化計算過
程，將提供優於原方案之產品結構設計，如表 2 所示。最後計算結果顯示最佳結構設計(圖
18)其績效將較原方案改善約 23%，由此驗證根據本研究方法，該公司能藉由審查不同結
果於後端之定量影響，結合設計、生產與配送等相關決策，決定整體最佳之產品結構。

及提高服務績效。本研究可指定某些特定零件為延遲功能零件，於結構設計中需儘可能
延後其組裝動作，越早組裝則於最佳化過程中給予較高的懲罰值。若原結構設計如圖 21

 Economical Green Product Design based on Simplified 
Computer-Aided Product Structure Variation 
 
Abstract 
Environmental issues have become an imperative concern for most companies in relation 
to modern product development. Special procedures have to be taken during the product 
development process to comply with recent green directives. Product structure is recognized 
as a critical factor that provides effective means for reducing environmental impact in product 
end-of-life. However, most previous studies failed to leverage the vast latitude at the design 
stage due to the assumption of a fixed product structure. To overcome this deficiency, we 
propose a CAD-based approach that allows automatic variation of 3D product structure by 
means of changing the combination of parts, selecting the assembly method, and re-arranging 
the assembly sequence. A computing scheme uses GA (Genetic Algorithm) techniques to 
produce an optimal product structure from the design alternatives generated by the approach. 
This corresponds to lower assembly/disassembly costs, while complying with specified 
recycling and recovering rates. The scheme also chooses a smaller set of parts that needs to be 
disassembled and determines an economical disassembly process. Implemented in a 
commercial CAD system, the test results demonstrated the effectiveness of this scheme in 
green product design in a cost-effective manner. 
Keywords: Green product design, product structure, CAD, Genetic Algorithms, 
Metaheuristics
factors, like the disassembly operation time, the disassembly method, and more importantly, 
the disassembly sequence. A computational approach was developed for estimating the cost. A 
Disassembly Precedence Matrix (DPM) was proposed to characterize the spatial constraints 
among individual components of an assembly and to generate the possible disassembly 
sequences under those constraints [2]. One major limitation in DPM is that a component is 
only allowed to move in a fixed direction in disassembly planning. Various techniques have 
been used to plan the disassembly process of a 3D product. Gungor and Gupta [3] combined 
the DPM concept with a branch-and-bound algorithm. Kuo et al. [4] employed a part 
connection network and modular disassembly analysis to find the optimal disassembly 
sequence, and demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach in the end-of-life treatment of 
electronic products [5]. Assuming a sequence-dependent disassembly cost, Lambert [6] 
proposed a modified two-commodity network flow approach that helps obtain a global 
optimum in the disassembly sequence planning. Gonzalez and Adenso-Diaz [7] developed a 
decision making mechanism based on the information contained in a bill-of-materials (BOM) 
for the product end-of-life decisions, with a focus on the waste treatment cost. Feldmann et al. 
[8] estimated the recycling rate based on the analysis results of a proprietary software tool and 
then suggested part material changes and/or modification of the assembly method, resulting in 
lower recycling costs [9]. Tseng and Chen [10] used personal computer upgrading as an 
example to illustrate how to implement a green design concept by proper part substitution. 
It is necessary to review computer-aided techniques concerning assembly and 
disassembly planning, as green product design is closely related to these processes. Smith [11] 
proposed multiple genetic operators that avoid premature convergence in GA-based assembly 
planning. The proposed method is, however, not integrated with CAD. The assembly 
constraints and interference detection among components must be given as a priori. Chao and 
Chen [12] analyzed assembly rules and constraints through the assembly relations of a 
product. These were then integrated with an assembly model and thus allow an evaluation of 
assemblability for the product configuration. Gottipolu and Ghosh [13] extracted geometric 
and mobility constraints from the CAD model of an assembly and translated them into two 
 Figure 1 Approach for product structure variation 
 
2.  MECHANISMS FOR PRODUCT STRUCTURE VARIATION 
Product structure (or architecture) is defined as a structural representation generated by 
mapping the product functions and physical components [15]. A three-step approach [16] has 
been proposed to determine product structure, consisting of (1) arranging functional elements, 
(2) mapping functional elements to physical components, and (3) defining interface 
specifications among components. We introduce a computational method based on a similar 
idea, which changes the product’s architecture using different mechanisms at each step. The 
following assumptions must hold in our method. First, a component database is given and 
consists of a set of candidate components that can be used to construct the product. The 
functional elements that each component can provide are given. 3D CAD models of those 
components already exist and the attributes related to the product assembly have been defined. 
As shown in Figure 1, the proposed method varies a product’s structure based on three 
mechanisms: combinations of different components, changes in the assembly method, and 
rearrangement of the assembly sequence. Any product structure variant must satisfy the 
functional requirements of the product and the assembly constraints among its comprising 
components during the variation process. Each mechanism is discussed as follows. 
Definition of Assembly Features and Interfaces 
There are different part assembly methods, such as welding, interference fit, adhesive 
bonding, and mechanical fastening. Each method requires a certain geometry or group of 
geometric elements to perform the assembly action. An assembly operation is usually 
specified with explicit rules like co-axis, co-plane, extended angle, and offset distance 
between geometric elements associated with 3D CAD models [19]. For simplification, this 
work only considers the assembly operations defined by the co-axis and co-plane conditions: 
¾ Co-axis: parts are assembled by aligning two linear axes.  
¾ Co-plane: parts are assembled by mating two planes with opposite normal vectors or by 
specifying a fixed distance between them. 
 
 
Figure 3 Cylindrical Assembly Features 
We assume that a feature volume, positive or negative, is created by sweeping a planar 
profile along a given direction. This is a common way of feature creation in most modern 
CAD systems. Figure 3 shows a solid model with three different feature volumes constructed 
in this manner: protrusion (E), depression (D), and through-hole (T). The through-hole feature 
is not limited to a round hole. The protrusion and depression features can provide both the 
co-axis and co-plane mating conditions for assembly, while a through-hole only contains a 
linear axis to be utilized. An assembly operation is accomplished by (1) aligning two axes and 
(2) specifying the relative position between two planes from different components. The final 
step is to fix the assembly by using the remaining degrees of freedom [20]. The planar face(s) 
to be mated is referred to as the assembly interface in this paper. 
Protrusion 
Through Hole 
Depression 
following steps. 
Step 1: Compatibility Test between Assembly Interfaces 
This step is to ensure that any two parts that are chosen possess a pair of compatible assembly 
features by checking whether any of the assembly features contained in one interface is able 
to match with that of the other interface. Step 2 will define the “match” conditions between 
different assembly features. Since a part may contain multiple assembly interfaces, we assume 
that the one providing more feature volumes will be given higher priority, i.e. it will be first 
selected in the variation process and the selection proceeds to the parts with fewer interfaces. 
Step 2: Change in Assembly Feature Type. 
An assembly feature may change its original type after assembly with another feature. 
Possible type changes are summarized as follows: 
¾ Assembly between a protrusion (E) and a depression (D): two parts can be put together 
with a protrusion in one part and a depression in another as long as their cross section 
(profile) and length (depth) are identical. Both features will be set inactive after the 
assembly, which means they cannot be used in the subsequent assembly. 
¾ Assembly between a through-hole (T) and a compatible feature: we can distinguish three 
different conditions in this case. 
 A protrusion (E) and a through-hole (T): two parts can be assembled with a 
protrusion in one part and a through-hole in another as long as their cross sections 
(profiles) are identical. If the protrusion length is greater than the through-hole 
depth, a new protrusion feature will be created after the assembly. If the 
through-hole depth is greater than the protrusion length, a new depression feature 
will be created. Both features will be set inactive if their sizes match exactly. 
Figure 5 illustrates these different conditions. 
 Two through-holes: two parts can be assembled with through-holes if their cross 
sections (profiles) are identical (see Figure 6(a)). A new through-hole feature will 
be created after the assembly. The depth of the new feature is equal to the sum of 
in Step 1, and thus the variation process repeats until one valid assembly is generated or all 
the interfaces have been used up. Notice that a number of assumptions have been made in the 
algorithm to lower the computation complexity of the variation process. Thus the result 
cannot cover all the possible ways of assembly between two parts.

A product can be constructed with different components and assembly methods. 
Different assembly methods usually incur different operation costs. For simplification, we 
only consider welding, adhesive bonding, and interference fit for the assembly. The total

• Only one part is disassembled at a time. 
• A part can be disassembled as long as the conditions defined in the DPM are 
satisfied. 
 
 
Figure 6 A disassembly example [2] 
Figure 6 is a simple example that illustrates how to define the disassembly constraints 
and to construct a DPM. There are a total of 7 components to be disassembled in this product. 
To compute a disassembly sequence, follow the steps below: 
Step 1: Determine the best disassembly direction: 
This step is used to determine the best disassembly direction by counting the number of the 
constraints for each part along different directions. As shown in Figure 6, P2 will be blocked 
by (P5, P6, P7), (P1, P6, P7), (P1, P3, P6, P7), and (P1, P4, P6, P7) along the directions of 
positive x, negative x, positive y, and negative y, respectively. Therefore, the removal of P2 
from the product will encounter the fewest constraints along the direction of positive x or 
negative x. Applying this concept to all the parts gives their best disassembly directions as 
shown in Table 3. The element value 0 indicates that there is no part blocking in this direction. 
become termination criterion in the algorithm, i.e. it is possible that only a fraction of the 
components, not all, are disassembled in the sequences. (Refer to Table 4 for the definition of 
the recycling and recovery rates) In addition, the recovery rate acts as a constraint only when 
further disassembly is unprofitable. 
 
Step 4: Construct the disassembly cost function 
This step is to find an optimal (at least locally) disassembly process, including the sequence, 
components to be taken apart, and the disassembly methods, in terms of minimized green cost, 
among all the possible sequences obtained in the previous step. The optimization process for a 
product’s end-of-life is expressed as:

This section has described the prerequisite tasks for conducting the optimization process. 
The product development costs mainly consist of the assembly cost and the disassembly cost, 
defined in Equations (1)-(3) and Equations (4)-(7), respectively. The corresponding 
constraints and the assumptions behind them were also discussed. Different mathematical 
programming techniques can be applied to obtain the optimum solution with the 
representations introduced by this section. The next section explains how we employ a 
GA-based approach to generate a better product structure compliant with the given green 
directives. 
 
4.  Optimizing Product Structure 
Genetic Algorithm 
Many combinatorial optimization problems from product design and manufacturing are 
too complex to be solved using conventional optimization techniques. A set of metaheuristic 
algorithms (simulated annealing, Tabu search, genetic algorithms) have thus been proposed to 
find approximate solutions for these problems. Among them, GA is a class of stochastic 
search algorithms based on the concept of biological evolution [21]. Due to the combinatorial 
nature of the product variation, we chose GA for computing an optimal product structure for 
green design. Figure 8 illustrates the optimization process. The objective is the total cost, 
including the assembly cost, the disassembly cost, and the recycling profit if it exists. The 
major constraint is complying with the given recycling and recovery rates. A better product 
structure is generated using the variation mechanisms described in Section 3, integrated with 
the genetic algorithms described below. 
Chromosome Representation for Product Structure  
One critical task in any genetic algorithm is the design of chromosomes. We are going to 
use two different chromosomes in the product structure variation. The first one represents the 
product structure by encoding the combination of different parts and their assembly methods 
simultaneously. As shown in Table 5, n is the total number of components comprising the 
 Table 5 Chromosome design for product structure

Assembly Method MjA(1) … MjA(n-1) 
 
 
Figure 9 Chromosome representation of a simple product 
Table 6 shows the chromosome design that represents different assembly methods. The gene 
values MjA of 1, 2, and 3 correspond to the assembly methods of welding, adhesive bonding, 
and interference fit, respectively. Figure 9 shows an example that illustrates the correlation of 
the two chromosomes to the product structure. Note that this representation scheme does not 
reflect the assembly validity represented by a chromosome, i.e. whether part interference 
occurs. This validity issue will be handled by the fitness function later on. 
 
 
scheme to break two chromosomes and combine the gene sequence on one side of the bit in 
the first chromosome with that on the other side of the other one. Two new offspring 
chromosomes are thus reproduced. If a pair of chromosomes does not need to crossover, then 
chromosome cloning takes place. We use two crossover operations in the evolution process. 
The first one is designed for variation of the assembly sequence. A part is randomly selected 
from a parent chromosome and its assembly sequence is exchanged with that in the second 
parent chromosome. Figure 10 shows that the second and third columns in the two 
chromosomes are going to switch and thus generate two new child solutions. Such a crossover 
operation may induce part duplication, e.g. there are two P1s in Child 1. A correction step 
needs to be applied to change the one not involved in the crossover, i.e. the first column in 
Child 1, to the part that is missing (P3 in this case). The corrected columns are circled in the 
figure. 
The second crossover is designed for variation of the assembly methods. The 
computation process is similar to the first crossover, i.e. two subassemblies are randomly 
picked from the parent chromosomes and their values are switched. Figure 11 illustrates the 
result, in which the methods of assembling, A1 and A2, have been changed. 
In a GA algorithm, a mutation operator is designed to avoid the loss of genetic diversity 
and consequently to ensure that the evolution process is not trapped at a local optimum. 
Similar to the crossover operations, there are two mutation functions in our algorithm. The 
first one randomly selects a part, and a gene from the chromosome of the part. The gene value 
(a binary one) is then switched. The resultant variation of the product structure is shown in 
Figure 12. The second mutation is performed to adjust the assembly method in a similar 
manner, as shown in Figure 13.

5.  Implementation and Test Results 
The proposed methods were implemented in CATIA™ V5R15 using CAA V5™ (Component 
Applications Architecture) technologies and Microsoft’s Visual C++. CAA V5™ provides an 
integrated framework and a set of APIs (Applied Programming Interfaces) for the development of 
customized modules in CATIA™. Most geometric processing functions provided by the system 
and the proprietary data structure of the CATIA models are accessible via C++ function calls. 
Figure 14 shows the implementation framework. It contains two major parts: a Green Design 
Module, a customized software component developed for this work, and the CATIA system. The 
Green Design Module consists of two computation mechanisms. Product Structure Variation is a 
VC++ static library that generates different product variants based on the three methods described 
in Section 2. A part database provides information for all the components to be used in the 
variation process through a text file. There is a CATIA part model corresponding to each of these 
components. The second part is responsible for the generation of a better product variant using GA. 
This C++ program is linked as a static library in the Green Design Module. 
 
Figure 14 Implementation framework for green product design 
One of the keys in the implementation is to access the CAD information and the geometric 
processing operations provided by the CATIA system. CAA V5™ was designed for this purpose. 
Customized modules can gain access to most of the computation resources that CATIA V5 is built 
upon, once they are implemented as a COM component in the CAA framework. Those functions 
are exposed as DLLs (Direct Link Library) at runtime. In fact, most of the CAD functions in 
A 3D ballpoint pen is used as a test example to demonstrate the effectiveness of this work. 
Table 7 shows the candidate parts that comprise a pen and the design functions provided by each 
part. Table 8 describes all the design functions (F1 F2 … F8) required by the pen. Other part 
attributes of concern include the part ID, material, and mass. These attribute values are retrieved 
from the corresponding CATIA model when a part is selected during the optimization process.

Reducing environmental impact has become an imperative for most developed countries and 
international enterprises. Companies have started to take special actions in product development in 
order to meet green directives, such as RoHS and WEEE, and achieve sustainable product 
development. Attempts undertaken at the design stage are considered to be the most effective and 
efficient. Among these, product structure design is a critical factor that not only characterizes how 
a product is formed, but to a large extent determines product end-of-life activities, like recycling

Data Management of Green Product Development with 
Generic Modularized Product Architecture 
ABSTRACT 
OEM/ODM/EMS manufacturers are facing a complicated situation in the mixed 
production environment, in which green and non-green products are fabricated 
simultaneously. They are losing competitiveness as a downstream supplier due to lacking of a 
cost-effective approach to managing product variations compliant with different green 
directives. This paper presents a methodology based on generic modularized product 
architecture that facilitates data management of green product development. The four-level 
architecture allows one unified representation for multiple product models. It enables a quick 
generation of their corresponding BOMs with an option control mechanism. A procedure 
consisting of seven steps is proposed to accomplish this. PDM functions are implemented to 
demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology using a real LCD-TV family as an example. 
This work provides a simple but useful tool for small-to-medium sized enterprises (SMEs) to 
perform green product development in an economical manner.

must not only begin to offer manufacturing services, parts, technologies, and systems that are 
WEEE/RoHS compliant, but also need to fulfil the purchasing standards regulated by their 
customers, i.e. international brand owners. Almost all of the global manufacturers in Taiwan, 
such as Quanta, MiTAC, Inventec, ASUS, and FIC, declared to have converted 
their suppliers and partners into the so-called Green Supply Chain [5]. They have so far been 
committed to restricting use of hazardous substances in the manufacturing processes and 
production activities. It is essentially uneconomical, however, for any company to develop a 
product in a different manner each specifically for one green directive. To impose the strictest 
regulation on the product is certainly not a cost competitive solution, either. In practice, there 
is a lack of systematic managerial methods for product development which can meet different 
environmental regulations at the same time in an economical way. 
The problem faced by many Taiwanese companies is more complex than that 
encountered by their customers. As OEM/ODM/EMS enterprise, local companies need to 
manage (or monitor) hundreds or even thousands of suppliers so as to guarantee their green 
compliance. In addition, they must simultaneously follow different purchasing standards 
imposed by their customers. In the absence of a systematic methodology and practical 
experience, these companies have chosen to employ such short-term strategies as “over-
quality” and “case-by-case” as their tentative solutions [5]:

Companies implementing (or attempting to implement) them normally have a greater 
authority/flexibility in product development, particularly at the design stage. They, most likely 
brand owners, can determine product function, specification, architecture, and detailed design 
at their will. As mentioned above, it is the OEM/ODM/EMS companies which are facing the 
most difficult situation in the green era. As downstream suppliers in a product life cycle, they 
do not possess much latitude in the product development. Restrictions have been imposed by 
their customers when outsourcing the product in the early stage. Therefore, the product 
engineering techniques may not be directly applicable to their circumstances of dealing with 
green product development.

Taking this into account, this work integrates product modularization with generic 
product architecture for better management of green and non-green product data with one 
modularized BOM representation. As shown in Figure 2, an option control mechanism 
enables quick product variations and produces correct BOMs based on the representation. 
Green and non-green models in a product family adopt one identical product structure. 
Implemented through PDM functions, this design simplifies the complexity of managing 
green and non-green product data simultaneously.

Modular product architecture  
This paper proposes a four-level modular product architecture which incorporates both 
the concepts of modularization and generic product architecture. As shown in Figure 3, the top 
most level is product family, which consists of a group of products. The next one is product 
model layer. Different models share a common architecture structure in terms of functional 
modules. The third level, the option control layer, is a unique concept proposed by this work. 
An option is a product attribute which can be varied to produce different product models in a 
product family. The option value specifies the possible alternatives in an option. An option 
value can be either a feature of one module or combination of multiple modules. The last level

that constructs modular product architecture following a modified modularization 
methodology [16]. A LCD TV family is used as an example. The procedure consists of the 
following steps: 
1. Categorizing product functions and mapping them to physical components: This step 
aims to identify the major functions of LCD TV and map each function to physical 
components (or modules) so as to specify their relationships. As a result, the functions of 
LCD TV can be categorized into six major groups and their mappings to physical 
components/modules are illustrated in Figure 4. 
2. Defining interface specifications: The relationships between components/modules are 
manifested by the interface specification, which defines (1) the interactions among 
physical components and (2) their geometrical relations. 
 
 
Figure 5 Geometric layout of LCD TV  
3. Constructing the modular architecture: After defining the interface specification, we can 
start to construct the modular architecture by analyzing the product geometric layout, as 
shown in Figure 5. Figure 6 illustrates the result expressed in a hierarchy of functional 
modules. It becomes the centrepiece in our generic product architecture and will be

5. Defining the option values: After identifying all the options in the product family, this 
step is to finalize the possible values in each option as shown in Table 2. The number of 
alternatives in each option is also listed. Each option value can then be correlated to 
specific physical components. For example, Figure 8 illustrates the correlations for two

by the green directives. Both Case module and Bracket module are made by plastic material, 
and thus should be taken into account. Power PCB module and Main PCB module are also 
affected by the “Green” option. The different green regulations is then included as the option 
values. For example, Table 4 lists RoHS, Sony, and Panasonic as possible option values, 
which implies that their restrictions on the product are different from each other.

In this manner, manufacturers can differentiate between RoHS, Sony, and Panasonic 
regulations and adopt them as their option values to further obtain different variants from 
single product architecture. The next step is to re-define the relationship between modules and 
components for each green option value, considering that each different green regulation 
indicates the need for different material or components to be supplied or designed. Finally, the 
corresponding product variations can be derived by selecting the specific option values. 
Table 5 illustrates the result of a 32” LCD TV. In this table, the product version code 
represents a combination of different option values. For example, 32”-A-D-B-220-PAL-RoHS 
represents the specification of this LCD TV of 32”, AUO panel, Dual-speaker, Black, 220 volt, 
PAL, and compliant to RoHS. With such a mechanism, OEM/ODM/EMS manufacturers can 
better manage product variants with less management effort such as managing product bill-of-
17 
More importantly, any minor mistakes in constructing a BOM may cause product 
development delays or failures in the end, thus squandering critical resources. This becomes 
an even more serious problem after green-compliance has become an imperative. 
Therefore, to perform a better (or correct) BOM management, this research proposes 
implementation of the generic product architecture using PDM functions. Facilitated by the 
option control mechanism, correct BOMs can be quickly produced for the 2,592 different 
product models in the LCD TV family. New product models can be added into the family 
without difficulty as long as their specifications have been defined according to the systematic 
procedure proposed in this paper. The following screenshots illustrate how PDM functions 
facilitate management of green product development. 
 
Figure 10 The modularized product architecture of LCD TV 
The first step is to construct the modularised product architecture shown in Figure 9. 
Figure 10 shows the hierarchical structure of the LCD TV family in terms of the composing 
modules, generated in a PDM system (TeamCenter [17]). Next, we need to specify all the 
options and the option values which are allowed to appear in the product family. As shown in 
Figure 11, seven options (see Table 4) are defined in a variant window. Clicking on the size 
option pops up an option value window, at which 20’’, 23’’, and 26’’ are given as possible TV 
screen sizes. 
19 
components/modules are associated with each green option value and the conditions in what 
conditions they comply with the corresponding green regulation. After completion of 
configuring the product architecture with the green option, the BOMs of various green 
products can be generated by selecting correct option values in the PDM system. Figure 12 
shows a green product model 32”-A-D-B-220-PAL-RoHS, which indicates the product, or 
more precisely, the modules that comprise of it have to comply with RoHS. In this case, the 
user only needs to select “RoHS” as the green option value; then the system will generate the 
corresponding BOM, as shown in Figure 13.

window, alerting users of invalid product variation by incorrect combination of option values. 
Figure 15 illustrates triggering of this mechanism. 
In summary, placing green design as an option in PDM helps manage green and non-
green product development data at the same time. The variant control mechanism eliminates 
incorrect product variations induced by improper combination of components and/or modules. 
It also automates a quick generation of correct BOMs in the system. 
6. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
Environmental issues have become one of the critical challenges most developed nations 
and global brands are facing. Introduction of green directives like RoHS and WEEE produces 
a profound impact on modern product development. Companies began to establish resultant 
green procedures during the product development process, e.g. their suppliers must follow 
green purchasing standards, design guidelines, and/or develop toxics-free manufacturing 
processes. The situation becomes highly complex when OEM/ODM/EMS manufacturers are 
producing green and non-green products, or green products compliant with different green 
standards, at the same time. Not only strive to guarantee that their daily operations are green-
compliant, but they also need to manage the product data in a better way to support such 
mixed production environment. These organizations, usually SMEs, are taking temporary 
strategies like “over-quality” and “case-by-case” when facing this problem. Inevitably, they 
start to lose competitiveness either with higher product development costs caused by the over-
quality or with poor product quality induced by the case-by-case approach. There is a lack of 
support in both managerial means and information technologies which can help downstream 
suppliers accomplish green product development in an economic manner.
