Abstract 
In the first part of the thesis, RuO2-SnO2 composite supercapacitors were 
synthesized via both the impregnation and cyclic voltammetric deposition. The 
RuO2-impregnated SnO2 xerogel was optimized for its electrochemical capacitance in 
aqueous 1 M KOH electrolyte by adjusting the calcination temperature and the RuO2 
loading. A specific RuO2 capacitance of 710 F/g-RuO2, is obtained with a RuO2 
loading of 1.4 wt. % and by calcination at 200 oC. Higher loadings presumably result 
in a homogeneous nucleation, causing severe reduction in the total surface area of the 
RuO2 crystallites. On the other hand, after the optimization of crystallization protocol 
(150 oC), the electroplated RuO2-SnO2 composite exhibited a specific RuO2 
capacitance of 930 F/g-RuO2 in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte and an overall specific energy 
of ~ 0.5 Wh/Kg at a specific power ≥ 1.5 kW/kg. Comparative studies demonstrated 
that this composite electrode exhibited a far superior performance than the electrodes 
having RuO2 similarly plated onto either smooth Ti or porous conductive carbon 
black. 
 
In addition, ferrites including MFe2O4 where M = Mn, Fe, Co, or Ni have been 
synthesized by coprecipitation methods and tested for their capacitive behaviors in 
aqueous NaCl solution. MnFe2O4 has been found to exhibit pseudocapacitance, while 
the other ferrites do not. The results indicated the pseudocapacitance was observed 
only for crystalline, rather than amorphous, MnFe2O4 phase. The MnFe2O4/CB 
composite showed pseudocapacitance in solutions of chloride, sulfate and sulfite salts 
of alkali and alkaline cations, with NaCl solution giving the highest capacitance. It 
has exhibited specific MnFe2O4 contributed capacitances of >100 F/g-MnFe2O4 and

power delivery. In spite of that pseudocapacitor is expected to possess a much larger 
capacitance due to its faradaic nature, many encountered problems have not been 
overcome. 
 
1.2 Motivations and Objectives 
    Although some carbon-based electrochemical capacitors have been 
commercialized as far owing to their low cost, the high rate performance is still the 
encountering problem, stemming from the limitation of slow ionic diffusion in porous 
structure. In addition, low specific volumetric capacitance also restricts its 
applications for tiny electronic devices. Therefore, much research has been focused on 
investigations of pseudocapacitor materials, especially for RuO2 supercapacitors, 
which can provide much higher specific capacitances than carbon-based electrode 
materials. The problem is that the extraordinarily high cost of RuO2 limits its 
industrial applications. 
This study is motivated to synthesize electrode materials which are more 
commercially attractive. First, we try to synthesize the RuO2/SnO2 composite 
materials by either impregnation or electrodeposition methods to enhance the utility of 
RuO2 component. Secondly, we put more effort on exploring a new pseudocapacitor 
material, MnFe2O4, having a lower cost and attempt to investigate its electrochemical 
characteristics and corresponding charge-storage mechanisms. 
At the end of this study, we adopt several analytical characterizations including 
in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, electrochemical 
quartz crystal microbalance, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to demonstrate the 
pseudocapacitance mechanism of MnO2 in aqueous electrolytes, which complements 
previous studies dealing with the issue of charge storage in manganese dioxide.

permittivity of dielectric, and d, the thickness of dielectric layer. The revealed 
capacitance, however, could not be greatly improved due to the physical constraints 
associated with a limited area of electrodes and a thickness of dielectric. For an 
electrochemical capacitor, on the other hand, the corresponding dielectric layer is 
generally constructed by ions or solvent molecules, of which the thickness is 
estimated within several Å [7,8]. In addition, porous structure bearing large surface 
area would result in a great enhancement in capacitance. Therefore, it is believed that 
an electrochemical capacitor can provide a capacity thousands times larger than a 
ceramic capacitor, and thus, it is also called supercapacitor or ultracapacitor. 
The construction of a typical electrochemical capacitor is illustrated in Fig. 2-2. 
It is constructed with two interfaces worked against each other with respect to the 
electrolyte solution, with a separator arranged between two electrodes. The schematic 
potential profile of an electrochemical capacitor is depicted in Fig. 2-3. In a 
concentrated electrolyte, almost all the potential applied is compensated at the 
electrode/electrolyte interface while merely a small potential drop caused by the 
resistance of solution is observed [8,9]. The detail description is left in section 2.1.2. 
 
2.1.1 Classifications of Electrochemical Capacitors 
Depending on different charge-storage mechanisms, electrochemical capacitors 
are generally divided into two categories. The first category is electric double layer 
capacitor (EDLC) and the other is pseudocapacitor. The fundamental concept of 
electric double layer capacitors stems from the solid/solution interface phenomena 
proposed in nineteenth century, which elucidates that the charged electrode/electrolyte 
interfaces contain double layers in nature [3,9,10]. Therefore, EDLC is a practical 
realization of such a conception in the field of electrochemistry. 
As shown in Fig. 2-3, on the capacitor electrode, the accumulated charge is a 
combination of an excess/deficit of electrons in the near-surface region of the 
interface for positive/negative electrode, respectively together with counterbalancing 
charges of accumulated electrolyte cations/anions on the solution side. That is, EDLC 
arises from the electrostatic separation of charges at the interface between electrode 
and electrolyte, and no faradaic reaction process is involved. Such double-layer 
capacitance is indicated to be typically potential-dependent and sensitive to systems

2.1.2 Models of Electric Double Layers 
The basic concepts underlying the field of the electrochemical capacitors, 
primarily for electric double layer capacitors, originate from interfacial phenomena at 
a charged surface. These phenomena of electric double layer, giving a picture of the 
way in which the excesses are arrayed at/near the interfaces, can be predominantly 
described by three different models, proposed historically in the literatures. 
The first one, the Helmholtz model, proposed at 1853, establishes a perceptible 
scheme of double layers [7,8]. The basic assumption is that no electron transfer occurs 
across the electrode/solution interface. Only the electrostatic interaction between ions 
and electrons is involved. It depicts that such double layer consists of two ‘compact 
array’ layers of opposite charges, one at electrode surface and the other one at solution 
side in vicinity of the interface (Fig. 2-4(a)). The differential capacitance Cd, similar to 
ceramic capacitors, is 
dV

0εεσ =∂
∂=                                            (2-2)     
where σ is the stored charge density, and V, the voltage. Because its simplification 
supposes that the charge on the electrode is confined to the surface, not all cases can 
be described precisely by the Helmholtz model. Therefore, deviation in capacitances 
from calculated value is inevitable, especially for dilute ionic solutions, in which a 
distribution of the charge carriers away from the interface is observed. A more 
sophisticated model is clearly presented in order. 
Gouy and Chapman proposed different theories containing the same concept at 
1910 and 1913, respectively, and thereafter the name, the Gouy-Chapman theory, was 
used [6]. This theory points out that it may take some significant thickness of solution 
to accumulate the excess charge which is needed to counterbalance the applied charge, 
and hence, ions on the solution side of the double layer would not be static in a 
compact array but rather subjected to the effects of thermal fluctuation, as depicted in 
Fig. 2-4(b). The diffuse-layer is treated with a mathematical equation, the 
Poisson-Boltzmann equation, based on the applications of Boltzmann energy 
distribution equation and Poisson’s equation:

2.1.3 Operating Characteristics of Electrochemical Capacitors 
    The basic operating characteristics of electrochemical capacitors are similar to 
those for ceramic capacitors but much different from batteries. A significant difference 
in discharge profiles is observed. In a battery cell, an ideal thermodynamic potential is 
believed independent of the extent of charge accumulated, as long as the couple of 
electrochemical materials remain coexisting. By contrast, the voltage on a capacitor 
declines rather linearly with the extent of charge, which arises formally from the 
relation between capacitance and voltage (dQ/dV equals to 1/C). It indicates that an 
electrochemical capacitor has continuous variation of free energy with degree of 
conversion of materials. Thus, the energy density, determined by integrating the V-Q 
profile, of a charged capacitor with a voltage difference is close to (1/2)CV2, while a 
battery gives a value of CV2. On the other hand, the power density, defined as the 
products of I and V, gradually declines as the charges accumulated are released.  
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is a convenient and sensitive method to evaluate the 
electrochemical characteristics of devices. The voltammogram of an electrochemical 
capacitor typically shows a rectangular-shape profile. For a pseudocapacitor, although 
couples of superficial faradaic reactions are involved, a rather mirror image in CV 
profile could be obtained due to the faster and much kinetically reversible reactions. 
On the other hand, for a battery electrode, the oxidation and reduction peaks in 
voltammograms are separated due to the overpotential, indicative of a completely 
irreversible process. In addition, the effects related to diffusion and resistance on 
capacitive behaviors can be examined by the extent of deviation in current response as 
switching the direction of sweep.

where V0 is the initial potential of the capacitor, R, the ohmic load resistance, and C, 
the capacitance of the capacitor. Potential profile shows an exponential decay, and 
hence, ln V declines linearly with time. 
 
III. Self-discharge under diffusion-control 
    This type of self-discharge corresponds to the two cases. The first one is that 
some depolarizing impurities are present and that undergo a faradaic reaction within 
the potential range of charging. The other is due to imperfections in the double-layer. 
The excess ionic concentration near the surface will diffuse to an equilibrium state.

application in EDLC is extremely restricted. Only very few materials, such as Sb 
doped SnO2 [22,23] and modified TiO2 [24], have reported to show characteristics of 
EDLC. However, the overall electrochemical performances of the materials can not be 
comparable to those of carbons. 
The potential of metal oxides in supercapacitor applications primarily focuses on 
pseudocapacitors. The pseudocapacitance, in general, is ascribed to the superficial 
redox reactions or chemisorption processes, in which the charge transfer is 
counterbalanced by the change in valency of metal ions. Till now, several transition 
metal-based materials, including RuO2 [25-46], IrO2 [47], MnO2 [48-61], V2O5 
[62,63], Fe3O4 [64-68], NiO [69-77], CoOx [78-80], Mo2N [81] and so on, have been 
demonstrated to exhibit pseudocapacitive behaviors. Amorphous ruthenium oxide, 
a-RuO2·xH2O, is the prototype of pseudocapacitor, which exhibits a capacitance over 
700 F/g with a potential window of 1.4 V in H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte [27,28]. Its 
metallic conductivity and fast charge/discharge properties corresponding to a fast 
proton insertion/de-insertion process make it more attractive. However, its 
extraordinary cost limits the commercial applications. Much research, therefore, has 
been focused on the development of RuO2-containing composite materials and the 
exploration of other substituted pseudocapacitor materials with lower costs. 
On the other hand, conducting polymers are a type of polymers which contains 
conjugated double bonds in the backbone of their macromolecule. This allows free 
movement of electrons within conjugation length. Recently, several conducting 
polymers, including polyaniline (PAN) [82,83], polypyrrole (PPy) [84-86], and 
poly-methyl-thiophene (PMeT) [86,87], have been reported in literatures to serve as 
electrode materials for pseudocapacitors. The corresponding pseudocapacitance is 
suggested originating from the doping/de-doping process, in which the anions and 
cations are simultaneously introduced into polymer chains during the course of 
electron transfer. Such kinds of conducting polymers possess large capacitance, which 
was shown to exceed 400 F/g, and are capable of high power delivery. The conducting 
polymers, however, have disadvantages of lower cycle life than carbon-based 
materials because the redox sites in the polymer backbone are not sufficiently stable.

2.3 Introduction to Ruthenium Oxide, RuO2  
2.3.1 Structure and Characteristics 
    Ruthenium oxide, RuO2, has rutile structure with space group of 144hD -P42/mmm, 
which is in common of many transition metal oxides. The unit cell belonging to the 
tetragonal Bravais lattice contains two RuO2 molecules, as illustrated in Fig. 2-5. Two 
Ru atoms occupy the 2a sites, (0, 0, 0; 1/2, 1/2, 1/2), while four O atoms occupy the 4f 
sites, ±(u, u, 0; u+1/2, 1/2-u, 1/2), where u is an internal parameter. The relatively 
large oxygen ions in rutile structure stack in a hexagonal closest-packed arrangement 
and one type of spatial interstitial site, octahedral site, is formed. Only half of the 
octahedral sites are occupied by ruthenium ions. The structure contains chains of 
edge-sharing RuO6 octahedra while the chains are corner sharing and in parallel to the 
c axis. Distortions away from perfect octahedral symmetry are typically encountered 
for the case of RuO2, referring to a compression of the octahedron along the principal 
axis, [1 1 0] direction [94]. 
    As to the electric conductivity, RuO2 is indicated to be one of the oxide materials 
bearing metallic conductivity [26], ~ 104 S/cm, which is an order of magnitude shared 
by IrO2 and TiO and about 2 orders of magnitude higher than carbon, over the whole 
accessible range of temperature. Ru-Ru distance and the radius of the cation in the 
oxide result in the possibility for overlap of inner d orbitals, and thus the 4d electrons 
in the partially filled conduction bands contribute to the metallic conduction [25,95]. 
The bottom of the conduction band has a large density of states with the t2g character. 
First principles electronic structure calculations [94,96] within the local-density 
approximation (LDA) using ab initio pseudo-potential and a plane-wave basis have 
been reported. The band structure and corresponding density-of-state (DOS) of RuO2 
are shown in Fig. 2-6 [96]. 
On the other hand, hydrated ruthenium oxide, RuO2·xH2O, is another form 
having importance in industrial applications, of which the characteristics are different 
from those of anhydrous one. Hydrous RuO2 is suggested a mixing proton-electron 
conductor, which could be use in fuel cells and supercapacitors. The apparent 
‘amorphousness’ of hydrous oxides has made it difficult to establish a correlation

2.3.2 Synthesis and Development on Supercapacitors 
Early, the interest in oxidized Ru surfaces arises from the use of RuO2 as a 
corrosion-resistant electrode material, so-called ‘dimensionally stable anodes’ (DSA), 
for anodic Cl2 evolution in the chlor-alkali process. Because of its excellent 
electrocatalytic properties, RuO2 has been used in various industrial applications. The 
concept and use of RuO2 as an electrochemical capacitor material could be traced to 
the research of Trasatti and Buzzanca [25] in 1971. They reported that RuO2 film 
exhibits capacitive behaviors in HClO4 solutions, of which the large capacitance is 
suggested to result from the redox reaction. Because RuO2 has several unique 
advantages, including a metallic conductivity and good proton diffusivity for 
amorphous phase, among oxides, the research on pseudocapacitor materials is almost 
focused on RuO2-derived materials all the time. So far, the amorphous hydrous 
ruthenium oxide, a-RuO2·xH2O is indicated to be the electrode material exhibiting the 
largest specific capacitance over 700 F/g in acidic solution. However, the capacitive 
behaviors of RuO2 are shown to strongly depend on the microstructure including 
crystallinity and morphology, which is directly affected by synthesis techniques. The 
following introductions on various types of RuO2 supercapacitors are based on the 
synthesis methods.  
 
Thermal decomposition.— RuO2 supercapacitor was first synthesized via thermal 
decomposition of RuCl3 by Trasatti and Buzzanca [25]. They reported that such RuO2 
film exhibits capacitor-like response, almost rectangular and mirror-image cyclic 
voltammograms in acidic solution, while the single crystal reveals characteristics of a 
redox reaction. The accumulated capacitance is suggested to be partially attributed to 
bulk phase redox reactions but not completely double-layer capacitance. The 
thermally formed RuO2 film can cycle between 0.05 and 1.2 V over 105 times with 
little degradation, which may result from the formation of RuO42- at high potential [6]. 
 
Sol-gel process.— Zheng et al. [27,28] first prepared sol-gel derived RuO2 
supercapacitor. The as-prepared powder, RuO2·2H2O, was amorphous in nature and 
became anhydrous after calcination over 300 oC. The optimized specific capacitance 
was 720 F/g in sulfuric acid solution for electrode calcined at 150 oC. The energy 
density of the capacitor was calculated about 26.7 Wh/kg at a potential of 1 V. It is 
 41
energy density of 17.6 Wh/kg under a power density of 4 kW/kg.  
 
Electrostatic spray deposition.— Kim et al. [35] used electrostatic spray deposition 
(ESD) to prepare RuO2 film-type supercapacitors. The electrode had highly porous 
microstructure with fractal-like agglomerates. 200 oC-calcined RuO2 film showed the 
best capacitive performance and provided a capacitance of ~ 650 F/g in H2SO4 
solution. In addition, the capacitance was almost insensitive to the scan rate, 
indicative of a superior high rate capability. 
 
As to the concern of extraordinarily high costs, mush effort was devoted to 
enhance the utilization of RuO2. Except for the addition of conducting carbons to 
enhance the dispersion of RuO2, another common method for enhancing RuO2 
capacitance is the addition of a second metal oxide, including VOx [98], SnO2 
[99,100], and TiO2 [101]. In particular, recent studies have shown that complex oxide 
possessing rutile or perovskite [102,103] structure are promising electrode materials 
for supercapacitors. Sugimoto et al. [98] synthesized rutile-type RuO2-VO2 solid 
solution as supercapacitor material via a polymerizable-complex method. This 
electrode material had excellent cyclability and good capacitive behaviors. For 
Ru0.35V0.65O2, the specific capacitance was about 1200 F/g-RuO2 and the capacitance 
decay was less than 8 % after 50,000 cycles. Ruthenates based on SrRuO3 perovskites 
were demonstrated to exhibit pseudocapacitive behavior [102,103]. Replacing up to 
20 mol.% Sr by La and 20 mol. % doping by Mn on the B-site leads to an increase of 
the specific capacitance. The optimum capacitance up to 270 F/g of the electrode was 
obtained by adjusting the composition and preparation route. 
 
 
 43
favor the inverse structure. In addition, certain metal ions have special preference in 
environmental configuration. Zn2+ ions, for instance, show a marked preference for 
tetrahedral sites while the preference of Ni2+ ions for an octahedral environment is 
certified. Therefore, Fe3O4 (FeFe2O4), CoFe2O4, and NiFe2O4 are suggested to belong 
to inverse spinels, while MnFe2O4 and ZnFe2O4 are normal ones. However, the 
deviation in ion distribution for most ferrites is observed and the actual distribution is 
suggested to depend on the different synthesis methods and post-calcination process 
[106-110]. The metal ion distribution of major ferrites along with lattice parameters 
and the anionic parameter u, which accounts for displacement of O atoms from ideal 
sites toward to [111] direction, are listed in Table 2-2. Experimentally, there are three 
major ways to acquire information on the distribution of the ions over the available 
sites. They are, namely, X-ray diffraction, predominantly neutron diffraction [107], 
Mössbauer spectroscopy [107,108,110], and X-ray absorption spectroscopy 
[106,107,109]. 
Ferrites are the most important ferromagnetic substances, which exhibit a 
substantial spontaneous magnetization at room temperature. Similar to ferromagnetics, 
they are composed of self-saturated domains and presenting the phenomena of 
magnetic saturation and hysteresis. The magnetization is caused by the moment of 
ions and exchange interaction between A and B sites [104,111]. The calculated and 
measured net moments, µB, of ferrites are listed in Table 2-2. 
Looking into the electrical properties of ferrites, the resistivity at room 
temperature can vary from about 10-2 ohm-cm to higher than 1011 ohm-cm [112]. The 
interfacial polarization effects of ferrites confirm that the observed conductivity may 
not at all be the true conductivity of the base material but rather depend on the 
composition and pre-treatment [112]. The unusual high conductivity of magnetite (not 
shown in the figure), an order of 102 S/cm, stems from a easy Fe2+-Fe3+ electron 
hopping on equivalent lattice sites, octahedral sites. By contrast, other highly resistive 
ferrites are made by interrupting such electron transfer. The temperature-dependent 
electric conductivities of ferrites were collected and shown in Fig. 2-9 [112]. Because 
of ferrites bearing semiconductor characteristics, an exponential increase of the 
conductivity with temperature has been reported to be governed by the same 
activation energy below and above the relaxation region. At high temperatures, 
electron transitions may take place from O2- to Fe3+ [112]. 
Further investigation on the electronic density of state for ferrites has been

2.4.2 Synthesis and Development on Supercapacitors 
    Spinel ferrites have been studied more than 50 years from both scientific and 
technological points of view. In literatures, lots of techniques have been reported to 
 49
hand, Kim’s group [68] synthesized a novel nano-sized cellular Fe3O4 thin film with 
high degrees of crystallinity by adopting an electrochemical deposition of green rust 
followed an oxidation process. The optimized porous magnetite exhibited a 
capacitance of 105 F/g in Na2SO4 electrolyte. 
    Our group [124] proposed that Fe3O4 thin-film type supercapacitor synthesized 
by one-step electrodeposition provides a capacitance of about 80 F/g in Na2SO3 
electrolyte. The pseudocapacitive redox reaction was investigated by electrochemical 
quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) measurement. The detail result is described in 
section 2-6-4.

structure [128]. Balachandran et al. [129] adopted first principles to show that protons 
are always covalently bonded to an oxygen atom in various MnO2 polymorphs. In 
ramsdellite, the protons prefer the pyramidal oxygen atom to the planar-coordinated 
oxygen atom (Fig. 2-13(a)). By contrast, in pyrolusite, in which only one type of 
oxygen is present (Fig. 2-13(b)), there is very large relaxation of the structure on 
proton intercalation, which contributes to an easy hopping across the tunnel between 
the two atoms showing an activation barriers of 25 meV [129].

environment, MnO2 was suggested to have potential in battery applications. Although 
the investigations on pseudocapacitors have kept on several years after exploring 
RuO2, the search for substituted materials was narrowed because of difficulties in 
exploring appropriate electrode/electrolyte systems providing fast charge/discharge 
properties associated with chemisorption and/or ion-inserted processes. With ongoing 
efforts, manganese oxide-based material was first introduced into electrochemical 
capacitors by Goodenough et al. [48,49] at 1999. Both potassium manganese oxide 
(KxMnO2⋅nH2O) and amorphous MnO2 (MnO2⋅nH2O) exhibited characteristics of 
capacitor in mild KCl(aq) electrolyte. In recent years, MnO2 has drawn much attention 
due to its superior capacitive performance and low cost. So far, several synthesis 
routes, including thermal decomposition [48], electrodeposition [50,53,54,59], sol-gel 
[60,61], and coprecipitation [52] have been successfully reported to synthesize MnO2 
supercapacitors. The electrochemical characteristics of various types of MnO2 are 
described as follows. 
 
Thermal decomposition.— Direct thermal decomposition of potassium permanganate 
(KMnO4) was first proposed by Goodenough et al. [48] to synthesize MnO2 
supercapacitor. The potassium manganese oxide (KxMnO2+δ⋅nH2O) powders were 
evidenced to have a well-defined layered structure with monoclinic symmetry. With 
moderate heat treatment, capacitive behaviors of MnO2 were exhibited. Electrode 
calcined at 550 oC showed the best performance in mild KCl aqueous electrolyte, of 
which the capacitance was about 243 F/g. The electrochemical stability was 
investigated by adjusting pH of electrolytes. It indicated the stable operating pH 
region was 5 to 11. 
 
Coprecipitation process.— At the same time, Lee and Goodenough [49] proposed a 
different synthesis method, coprecipitation process, for preparation of MnO2 
supercapacitor. The process involved a self-redox reaction of Mn ions by mixing two 
aqueous solutions containing Mn(VII) and Mn(II), respectively. The reaction is 
described as: 
     2 Mn(VII) + 3 Mn(II) ↔ 5 Mn(IV)                            {2-1}     
Unlike thermal decomposed KxMnO2+δ, amorphous hydrated manganese oxide was 
obtained via coprecipitation. However, the electric conductivity is not good. A nearly 
 57
of reducing agents on performance of MnO2. The microstructure, morphology, and 
composition including water content were changed with synthesis conditions, and thus 
resulted in variation in capacitive performance. The optimized specific capacitance 
was calculated around 250 F/g in NaCl electrolyte. Reddy et al. [60,61] used organic 
reducing agents including sodium fumarate (Na2C4H2O4) and solid fumaric acid 
(C4H4O4) and adopted different drying methods to control the microstructure. Similar 
capacitive behaviors was presented but only ~140 F/g in NaCl(aq) was obtained. It is 
worth noticing that the addition of acid during the process could disproportionate 
over-reduced Mn3+ into Mn4+ and soluble Mn2+ ions, and thus stabilized Mn(IV)O2 
structure during the characterizations. In addition, a thin-film-coated MnO2 electrode 
was proposed to show a capacitance of near 700 F/g [50] and exhibit an unacceptable 
capacity, which discharged at a fair current density for a very short time interval (~ 1 
sec). 
 59
of electrodeposited RuO2 film was carried out by Schreson’s group [132-134] to 
investigate the modifications in electronic and structural properties during cycling. A 
consecutive decrease in absorption energy of Ru L-edge, indicating a decreasing Ru 
valency, during the cathodic sweep was observed while the failure in K-edge spectra 
was encountered. The extended fine structure analysis illustrated a clear deviation of 
structural environment. In the reduced form, the second-shell Ru-Ru interaction 
disappeared and only the first-shell EXAFS response corresponding to Ru-O 
interaction was revealed. This implies a decrease in the extent of atomic ordering due 
to the participance of species in the redox reaction. 
Atanososki [6] first used EQCM to demonstrate the weight change during the 
reactions. Thermally prepared RuO2 showed a linear mass gain of 56.3 g/mol-e- 
during whole anodic sweep, corresponding closely to H7O3+, protonated water cluster. 
Electrostatic spray deposited RuO2, reported by Kim’s group [135], by contrast, 
showed similar responses but had a different slope, 3.48 g/mol-e-, indicative of proton 
is the major ionic species participating in reactions. On the other hand, Santos et al. 
[136] showed that the mechanism of RuO2 film prepared by polymeric precursor 
method consists of three steps involving insertion of protons along with different 
amount of water molecules, balanced by change in the valance state of Ru along the 
redox transitions of Ru2+/Ru3+, Ru3+/Ru4+, and Ru4+/Ru6+, respectively. 
 
2.6.2 Manganese Oxide, MnO2 
MnO2 is a promising pseudocapacitor material exhibiting capacitances over 200 
F/g in aqueous solutions of several alkali salts, such as LiCl, NaCl, and KCl. Although 
there has been a general consensus that the charge storage involves electron transfer at 
Mn sites, the interfacial reaction mechanism that balances the charge-transfer remains 
unclear. Lee and Goodenough [48,49] first suggested that, for both MnO2⋅nH2O and 
KxMnO2⋅nH2O supercapacitors synthesized via thermal decomposition with aqueous 
KCl electrolyte solution, charge transfer at Mn sites is balanced by the 
chemisorption/desorption of K+ based on CV analysis showing unusually large 
currents. Toupin et al. [52] approved the concept associated with chemisorption by 
showing a surface-area dependent capacitance of coprecipitated MnO2, unlike the 
results observed in amorphous RuO2 supercapacitors [27,28]. Pang et al. [50], on the 
 61
Na2SO3 electrolyte [65,66]. The charge-storage mechanism of Fe3O4 in aqueous 
electrolyte was proposed by Wu’s group [124] based on EQCM analysis along with 
CV measurement. The corresponding mass-to-charge ratio in sulfite electrolyte were 
exclusively negative and showed a very broad range of values, from -18 to -3, which 
suggests that the pseudocapacitive mechanism involved is completely different from 
that associated with RuO2 [6,135,136]. XPS analysis, complementary to EQCM, 
showed a red-shifted shoulder in S 2p3/2 peak and almost no change in Fe 2p3/2 peak 
during the reduction reaction. Thus, the pseudocapacitance is suggested to 
predominantly result from successive reduction of the specific adsorbed sulfite ions, 
described as: 
−−−− +↔++ OHOSeOHSO 6432 232223                         {2-5}     
−−−− +↔++ OHSeOHOS 6283 22232                          {2-6}     
By contrast, in Na2SO4 solution, the capacitive current is due entirely to EDLC. 
 
2.6.5 Cobalt Oxide, Co3O4 
    Cobalt oxide electrode materials have been studied extensively on the issue of 
applications in electrocatalysis and lithium ion batteries. In recent years, Co3O4 has 
been indicated to exhibit capacitive behaviors in basic solution within a potential 
window less than 0.5 V. Lin et al. [78] reported that Co3O4 supercapacitor exhibited a 
capacitance over 200 F/g, which gave a superficial capacitance of around 90 µF/cm2. 
Sirnivasan et al. [79] ascribed the pseudocapacitance to the surface redox reaction, 
close to chemisorption, on Co species because of a surface-area sensitive capacitance. 
A common consensus on charge storage is presented. However, the further evidence 
and investigations on mechanism have not been done. The corresponding superficial 
redox reaction can be described as  
−− +↔++ eCoOOHOHOHOCo 3243                         {2-7}     
The reaction proposed is similar to the case of NiO.

2.7 Experimental Techniques 
2.7.1 Electrochemical Quartz Crystal Microbalance 
    Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance is an instrument composed of a 
quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and an additional electrochemical analyzer. This 
novel technique, first introduced in 1959 by Sauerbrey, is invented to detect the slight 
change in mass on the working electrode, monitored by QCM, simultaneously along 
with an electrochemical measurement. EQCM investigation, therefore, has become 
more attractive and drawn much attention recently. 
    A schematic illustration of EQCM is shown in Fig. 2-14. QCM is predominantly 
constructed by a slice of quartz crystal with gold (or platinum) electrode sealed on it. 
The quartz crystal is frequently clamped in appropriate O-ring joint to expose only 
one of the contacts to the solutions. The fundamental operation of QCM is primarily 
based on the piezoelectric properties of quartz crystal, which cause it to deform when 
an electric field is applied. The bare quartz crystal has a particular mechanical 
resonant mode upon its size and thickness. Therefore, when a sinusoidal electrical 
signal of this frequency is applied to the gold contacts, it oscillates at a frequency, f0. 
The frequency of oscillation is sensitive to mass changes on the crystal surface as 
expressed by the Sauerbrey equation [9]: 
mC
mnf
f f−=−=∆ 2/10 )(ρµ                                  (2-9)     
where ∆f is the frequency change resulting from an addition of a mass per unit area, m, 
to the crystal surface, n, harmonic number of oscillation, µ, the shear modulus of 
quartz, and ρ, the density of quartz crystal. The EQCM, however, should be rightly to 
be called a nano-balance because the sensitivity of devices is considered to be on the 
order of 1-2 ng/cm2. According to the Sauerbrey equation, a frequency increase is 
directly proportional to a mass loss while other parameters are constant at the 
specified environment. However, the behavior also depends on the medium where the 
crystal is operating, because the medium couples to (or ‘loads’) the crystal surface and 
affects the shear modulus. fo and Cf values in liquids are suggested lower than those in 
air or vacuum. In addition, the frequency of oscillation is also temperature-dependent, 
which is attributed to that the density and viscosity of a solution are functions of 
 65
edge. This technique has been known for over 50 years, but the field has evolved 
significantly since 1970 and is advancing rapidly after the development of 
synchrotron radiation. 
X-ray absorption spectroscopy stems from the absorption, so-called photoelectric 
effect, of high energy X-rays by core-electron in a sample. Each core electron has a 
well-defined binding energy, and thus, when the energy of incident X-ray is scanned 
across one of these energies, an abrupt increase in absorption coefficient is observed, 
which refers to ‘absorption edge’ of an element. Absorption edge is indexed based on 
the subshell of core-electron excited, in which K-edge denotes an absorption 
associated with 1s electron transition.  
A general X-ray absorption spectrum, as depicted in Fig. 2-15, can be typically 
considered into two spectral regions: X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), 
in which the energy of incident X-ray is within 50 eV above the edge, and extended 
X-ray absorption fine structure, EXAFS, which encloses the region between 50 to 
1000 eV above the edge. In the XANES region, transitions of core electrons to 
non-bound levels take place. In addition, pre-edge region with minor features, caused 
by the electron transitions from the core level to the higher unfilled or half-filled 
orbitals, could be observed. On the other hand, in the EXAFS region, a deep core 
electron is excited into a state above the Fermi energy, and thus this photoelectron 
propagates and experiences scattering by the first and even higher coordinating shells. 
In general, XANES contains information associated with the valency and density 
of states of the absorber, as well as qualitative structural information, while EXAFS 
encloses the detailed information with respect to the local atomic structure, including 
bond length (interatomic distance), coordinated number, type of coordination atoms, 
and extent of structure disorder. EXAFS oscillation, which is not observed for isolated 
atoms but only for atoms in a condensed matter, results from the interference of the 
out-going and the back-scattered photoelectron waves. EXAFS inherently serves as 
short-range order probe, and therefore, the materials analyzed can be solids bearing 
amorphous phase, liquids and even gases. However, it does not provide information 
on long-range order and thus can not replace diffraction techniques but only 
complements them. 
The surge in interest in EXAFS is caused by the realization that EXAFS can be 
used to acquire information about the arrangement of atoms in the locality of the 
absorbing atom. Since the EXAFS has found wildly applicability in many diverse 
 67
fact that there is no simple analytic description on XANES spectra. The main 
difficulty is that the EXAFS equation breaks down at low k, because 1/k term and the 
increase in mean-free-path of photoelectron at low k cause a multiple scattering. In 
addition, there is much chemical information involved. That complicates the XANES 
interpretation, and thus, it is hard for quantitative analysis. The exact physical and 
chemical interpretation for all spectra feathers is difficult to complete precisely and 
reliably. Recently, some scientists intended to use ab initio calculation to simulate the 
XANES spectra and all are still in progress.

described above. Prior to calcination, the surface grafting was carried out by reacting 
with hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS; (Si(CH3) 3) 2NH)) at 130 oC for 1 h to remove 
most of OH groups [23]. A further calcination procedure was carried out in air with a 
heating rate 50 oC/h to a temperature of 800 oC for 1 h. 
The SnO2 electrodes comprise HMDS-treated SnO2 xerogels along with 5 wt.% 
PVDF binder, which was spread onto a Ti foil. A cyclic voltammetric deposition 
method was introduced to deposit hydrous ruthenium oxide, RuO2?nH2O [32,142]. 
The plating solution consists of 5.0 mM RuCl3, 0.01 M HCl, and 0.1M KCl with 
initial pH of 1.96. The electrodeposition of RuO2 was performed at 50 oC and cycled 
within ±1.0 V for a symmetric cell with a scan rate of 20 mV/s for cycling 30 times. A 
calcination procedure followed was carried out at selected temperature 50 and 200 oC 
with a 50 oC increment. Figure 3-2 illustrates the procedure for preparation of 
electroplated RuO2-SnO2 electrode.  
 
3.1.3 Single-phased Ferrite Materials 
Ferrites, including MFe2O4 where M = Mn, Fe, Co Ni or Cu, were synthesized 
via a coprecipitation technique in basic aqueous solutions as described below [143]. 
Pre-determined amount of either hydrated MCl2 (M = Fe, Co Ni and Cu) or MnSO4 
was dissolved along with FeCl3·6H2O with a stoichiometric ratio of 1:2 in a 20 mL of 
1 M HCl aqueous solution, giving a molar concentration of 0.6 and 1.2 M for M2+ and 
Fe3+, respectively with continuously bubbling N2. When the salt solution was dropped 
into a 200 mL of 1.5 M NaOH solution under vigorous stirring, either black or 
dark-brownish precipitate was formed immediately. The temperature of solution was 
controlled at 30 oC during the whole process. Once the precipitate sedimented, the

3.1.6 Electroplated MnO2 Thin Film 
MnO2⋅nH2O thin films were deposited onto the gold working electrode in the 
EQCM cell (CHI 405a/CH Instrument) by an anodic deposition process as described 
in [53]. The electroplating solution is 0.25 M MnSO4 solution with pH ~ 5.0. The 
deposition was performed under a constant potential of 0.9 V with respect to 
Ag/AgCl/saturated KCl(aq) (EG&G, potential 197 mV vs normal hydrogen electrode 
(NHE) at 25oC) with a total passed charge of 0.2 C/cm2. The amount of deposit was 
simultaneously monitored by the quartz-crystal microbalance. After deposition, the 
electrode was washed with deionized water prior to subsequent analyses.

3.2 Analysis and Characterization 
3.2.1 Phase Identification 
    Phase identification is predominantly carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD) 
analysis, which is used to explore the nature of matters including the determination of 
constituents and crystalline phases. In this study, XRD was performed on the 
diffractometers (MAC Science/MXP and X’pert/Philips) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 
1.5418 Å). The X-ray generator equipped with a graphite monochromator was 
operated at 40 kV and 30 mA. The width of both the solar and divergent slits is 1.0o. 
In addition, the reflection data of powder samples was mostly collected under a 
continuous-scanned θ-2θ mode at a scan-rate of 4 o/min. The scan-range is typically in 
the range of 15 to 80o. 
Except for phase identification, average crystallite size can be determined based 
on the Debye-Scherrer equation, adopting the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 
the specified reflection in diffraction patterns, described as: 
BbB
d θ
λ
cos
9.0
22 −
=                                      (3-1)     
where d is the average crystallite size, λ, the wavelength of incoming X-ray, B, the 
revealed HWFM of the specific reflection, b, line broadening width of instrument, and 
θB, the Bragg angle. 
Complementary to the conventional XRD, synchrotron XRD provides a more 
powerful analytical ability. The advantages of collimated ultra-high intensity X-ray 
and excellent signal-to-noise ratio make either the trace amount of impurities or 
less-crystalline materials, of which reflections could not be spatially identified, more 
examinable. In this work, synchrotron XRD was performed by using beam-line 01-C2 
facilities of the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC) in Taiwan. 
The synchrotron XRD instrument setup was shown in Fig. 3-4(a), and the 
construction of the electrochemical cell for both in-situ studies, including XRD and 
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (mentioned later), is illustrated in Fig. 3-4(b). The 
main body of the cell was made of acrylics, and the two sides of the cell were 
perforated and then sealed with Kapton foils in order to allow the probing beam to 
 79
C, constant. A linear relation of P/(V(P0-P)) and P/P0 can be obtained, which gives a 
slope of (C-1)/VmC and intercept of 1/VmC; and thus the specific surface area can be 
calculated based on the volume of adsorbed nitrogen. BJH (Brunauer, Joyner, and 
Halendar) scheme for determination of mesopore distribution is based on Kelvin 
equation and thickness equation, showing the relation between relative pressure and 
pore size. In this study, 5-points measurement was utilized for determining BET 
surface area, in which the relative pressure ranging from 0.06 to 0.20; in the 
meanwhile, 55-points detection was measured for mesoporous characteristics. The 
equilibrium interval time was set as 20 sec. 
 
3.2.4 Measurement of Chemical State  
    The valence state of each element in samples was carried out on a X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscope (MT 500/VG Microtech) equipped with a Mg X-ray 
source (Kα, energy is 1253.6 eV). The binding energy of the specified elements was 
measured. Due to the surface-sensitive property of photoelectron, the signal presented 
only reveals information of surface layer within about 10 Å. The bulk property of 
samples could be obtained after removing the outer surface layer by ion etching. In 
this study, the films were sputter-cleaned by 4 keV Ar-ion etching for 5 and 10 min at 
a target current of 1 µA and a pressure of 10-9 bar. The beam current was set as 7.5 
mA. The corresponding sputter rate was estimated about 1 nm/min for oxides [144]. 
In addition, only the XPS signals with the highest intensity for elements were 
detected. 
To prepare for the XPS analysis, the film electrodes which were removed out of 
electrolyte solutions were first thoroughly rinsed, then sandwiched between two filter 
papers to remove major portion of the residue solution, and finally dried at 50 oC in air. 
In order to eliminate the chemical shift stemming from the charging, the charge-up 
effect on the peak positions was corrected by reference to C 1s signal of adventitious 
contamination hydrocarbon to 248.8 eV.

3.3 Electrochemical Characterizations 
3.3.1 Preparation of Electrodes 
For ferrite supercapacitors, two types of electrodes have been prepared for 
characterization. The first type, which will be referred to as the “mixed” electrode, 
consists of the ferrite particles and the CB powder with a weight ratio of 9:1 mixed by 
mechanical grinding, in which polyvinylidene difluoride (PVdF) in 10 wt.% was used 
as the binder for electrodes, Ti foil was used as the current collector and 
N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) was served as the solvent. The second type, referred to 
as the “coprecipitated” electrode, was made of the ferrite/CB composite powders and 
PVdF with a weight ratio of 9:1. The electrodes were finally dried at 120 oC for 6 h in 
vacuum. The thickness of the electrodes was about 70 to 100 µm. On the other hand, 
for MnO2 supercapacitor, the electrode was also composed of precipitated powders 
and CB with a weight ratio of 8:2, along with PVdF in 10 wt.% as the binder, while 
the electroplated MnO2 film was directly used without any further treatment. 
    Besides, synchrotron XRD and XAS analyses used the electrode made of the 
mixture of the MnO2 particles and CB with the same ratio, while 
poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) (5 wt.%) was used as the binder and Ti mesh was 
the current collector. 
 
3.3.2 Cyclic Voltammetry 
    The capacitive behaviors and electrochemical performance of electrodes were 
primarily investigated by cyclic voltammetry conducted with an electrochemical 
analyzer (PGSTAT30/Eco Chemie). Two different configurations, including 
three-electrode and two-electrode cell (symmetric cell), are used, as shown in Fig. 3-5. 
For the three-electrode configuration, the working electrode composes of active 
materials and conductive additive, in the meanwhile, the counter and reference 
electrodes were Pt mesh and Ag/AgCl/saturated KCl(aq), respectively. The molar 
concentration of all the aqueous electrolytes was 1.0 M. The potential-scan rate ranges 
from 2 to 200 mV/s. On the other hand, two-electrode configuration (symmetric cell), 
in which two identical electrodes are placed oppositely, is used to investigate practical

variation of +1.0 Hz corresponds to a mass change of -1.4 ng. In a typical run, the 
potential of the oxide-coated working electrode was cycled at a constant scan rate in a 
three-electrode configuration which comprises a platinum counter electrode and a 
Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and the current and quartz frequency were 
simultaneously recorded. A schematic diagram of the apparatus of EQCM is presented 
in Fig. 2-14.

Chapter 4  Characterization of RuO2/SnO2 
Composite Supercapacitors 
4.1 Introduction 
    Ruthenium oxide, RuO2, is known to be a promising pseudocapacitor material 
which is capable of achieving high specific energy and power due to its large 
capacitance and high conductivity. The extraordinary capacitances for RuO2 are 
attributed to protonation and oxygenation is acidic and alkaline electrolytes, 
respectively. However, its high cost limits commercial applications, and thus efficient 
utilization of ruthenium oxide is essential for making the devices more cost-effective. 
There have been several studies of combining ruthenium oxide with other materials to 
form composite electrodes with the intention to increase the dispersion of the oxide. 
Combinations of RuO2 with other oxides, including VOx, TiO2, MoO3 and SnO2, have 
been reported. Among all of the ‘second-component’ materials, SnO2, particularly 
with proper doping, has the advantage of high conductivity as high as 102 to 103 S/cm 
[146-148]. 
    In this study, two different RuO2-SnO2 composite supercapacitors were 
presented, which were synthesized via impregnation and cyclic voltammetric 
deposition. The utilization of RuO2 crystallites was greatly enhanced by introducing a 
second porous material. 
 
 
 
 89
increment of 50 oC established that the heat treatment at 200 oC resulted in the largest 
capacitance in KOH electrolyte. The voltammograms for a symmetric cell consisting 
of electrodes containing 1.4 wt.% RuO2, which have the largest capacitance among 
the composite electrodes, are presented in Fig. 4-6. The nearly rectangular-shape 
current profiles, characteristic of ideal capacitors, were shown. The following 
characteristic capacitive properties were identified. First, the electrodes have an 
operating voltage range of 1.0 V, i.e. the same as that of the blank SnO2 xerogel 
shown in Fig. 4-4. Second, the electrodes have a capacitance which is approximately 
three times greater than that of the xerogel (Fig. 4-4 and Fig. 4-6). At the scan rate of 
4 mV/s, for instance, the composite electrode exhibits a specific capacitance of ~ 15 
F/g, in comparison with ~ 5 F/g for the xerogel. Finally, the capacitance of composite 
electrodes also decreases with increasing scan rate. For the composite electrode with 
RuO2 loading of 1.4 wt.%, the capacitance decreases at about the same rate as that of 
the blank SnO2 (curve 1 and 2, Fig. 4-5). Reduction in capacitance is, however, slower 
for the electrode with higher RuO2 loadings (curve 3, Fig. 4-5). 
    The decreased trend of the capacitance suggests that parts of the surface of both 
SnO2 and RuO2 are inaccessible at high charging-discharging rates. Hence, the 
specific capacitance based on the data obtained at the low scan rate of 4 mV/s is 
believed to be closest to that of full utilization of the electrode materials because there 
is almost no variation in capacitance even at a lower rate of 2 mV/s. Figure 4-7 plots 
the specific electrode capacitance, which is based on unit weight of the entire 
electrode as a function of RuO2 loading. The specific electrode capacitance exhibits a 
maximum of ~ 15 F/g at RuO2 loading of 1.4 wt.%. If the enhancement in capacitance 
related to the blank xerogel electrode is completely attributed to the loaded RuO2, the 
corresponding capacitance contribution of RuO2 is also depicted (curve 2, Fig. 4-7). A 
maximum specific capacitance of ~710 F/g-RuO2 was found at 1.4 wt. % loading. 
 
Discussion on the effect of RuO2 loading.— In studying the effect of calcination on 
hydrous ruthenium oxide, RuOy·xH2O, in sulfuric acid electrolyte, Zheng and Jow 
[27,28] demonstrated that the material exhibited a maximum capacitance of 720 F/g 
upon calcination at 150 oC, in which the oxide remained amorphous, and that the 
capacitance decreased rapidly to 150 F/g upon crystallization at 200 oC. In contrast, 
the maximum capacitance in KOH electrolyte was obtained in this work by 
calcination at 200 oC, where the oxide is supposed to be partially crystalline. The 
 91
while the composite electrodes with higher loadings show a much slower rate of 
decline in capacitance, as shown in Fig. 4-5. Extensive homogeneous nucleation 
arising from rapid drying could have occurred to cause preferential deposition of Ru 
salt near the peripheries of the xerogel particles. This will lead to reduced sensitivity 
of electrode capacitance toward scan rate, as the RuO2 crystallites are accessible at 
both high and low scan rates.

CV analysis.— Figure 4-10 shows the voltammograms of a symmetric RuO2-SnO2 
cell that comprises two electrodes deposited for 30 cycles (1.5 wt.% RuO2) and 
subsequently calcined at 150 oC. The voltammograms show rectangular anodic and 
cathodic profiles that are of mirror-image, characteristic of an ideal capacitor. The 
great enhancement due to RuO2 deposition was evidenced. Chronopotentiometric 
analysis using a constant discharge current density of 3 mA/cm2 showed the overall 
electrode capacitance of around 24 F/g. For comparison, blank SnO2 electrodes 
subjected to the same heat treatment procedure as the composite ones only showed a 
capacitance of 10.0 F/g. Accordingly, by subtracting the contribution from the SnO2 
substrate, the specific capacitance based on the RuO2 component was estimated to be 
930 F/g-RuO2. 
 
The Ragone plot of the cell showed essentially a constant specific energy of ~ 
0.5 Wh/Kg over a very wide range of specific power from 2.5x10-3 to ~1.5 kW/kg, 
except for a small step decrease at ~0.25 kW/kg that can largely be attributed to the 
loss of capacitance of SnO2 (Fig. 4-11). Cycling-stability test under a charge current 
density of 3 mA/cm2 showed first 5 % drop in capacitance within the first 500 cycles 
and a level-off at an overall 7.5 % drop after 1000 cycles (Fig. 4-12). The coulombic 
efficiency as shown in Fig. 4-12, which is defined as the ratio of discharged and 
charged capacities within each cycle, remains almost 100 % after 1000 cycles. The 
practical operating voltage range is 1.03 V where the specific leakage current is less 
than 2.0 mA/g, as shown in Fig. 4-13.  
Comparison was made between RuO2-SnO2 composite electrode and two other 
composite electrodes that were synthesized by the same deposition and calcination 
processes but used substrates having very different porosity nature. First, RuO2-Ti 
electrode was prepared by electroplating RuO2 onto flat Ti foil (30 cycles; 150 oC). 
The electrode showed an overall capacitance that is one third of that of RuO2-SnO2 
electrode (Fig. 4-10) and merely 670 F/g-RuO2 for the RuO2 component. SEM 
analysis revealed that RuO2 was deposited on SnO2 electrode in the form of particles 
with sizes less than 0.2 µm either on SnO2 crystallite surfaces or forming skeletal 
structures within voids (Fig. 4-14(a)). In contrast, RuO2 deposit formed a dense film 
on Ti foil (Fig. 4-14(b)). The densely agglomerated film structure apparently reduces 
the utilization of the deposited RuO2.

Chapter 5  Investigation on Capacitive 
Performance of Ferrite Supercapacitors 
5.1 Introduction 
For pseudocapacitors, although amorphous ruthenium oxide has been 
demonstrated to exhibit high specific capacitances and power-density in aqueous 
H2SO4, its extraordinary cost limits commercial applications. Therefore, much 
research has been focused on the development of pseudocapacitive materials of lower 
cost. Magnetite (Fe3O4), another inexpensive material, has been evidenced to be the 
only one exhibiting pseudocapacitance in aqueous electrolyte among iron oxides 
[64-66]. Its capacitance, ranging from 30 to 510 F/g, has been found to be very 
sensitive to the electrolyte anion species and the dispersion of the oxide crystallites. 
After that, the charge-storage mechanism, investigated via EQCM, was evidenced to 
involve a consecutive electron transfer process associated with the specifically 
adsorbed sulfite ions, SO32-, to sulfide ion, S2- [124]. This interesting result actually 
presents a possibility for anion-type pseudocapacitor, differing from RuO2 and MnO2 
involving cation insertion process. Such electron transfer process, however, for 
magnetite is too slow for high-power applications. 
In view of that spinel structure plays a crucial role for pseudocapacitance, there 
are also known several ferrites bearing the same general formula, namely MFe2O4, as 
and similar crystal structures to Fe3O4 (or FeFe2O4). This study was originally 
motivated to investigate the capacitive behaviors of these divalent metal substituted 
ferrite materials, including MnFe2O4, CoFe2O4, and NiFe2O4. Furthermore, the

dramatically with calcination temperature. Taking MnFe2O4 for instance, the surface 
areas of as-precipitated and 600 oC-calcined powders were 252 and 23.3 m2/g 
respectively, showing a reduction by ~90%. The specific surface area of all other 
calcined ferrites was listed in Table 5-1. 
 
XANES analysis.— Further investigations on electronic configuration and atomic 
arrangement of as-precipitated and calcined ferrites were conducted with X-ray 
absorption spectroscopy. Figure 5-4 depicts XANES spectra of both M (M = Mn, Co, 
Ni) and Fe K-edges for all ferrites, in comparison with the standards of divalent and 
trivalent metal oxides, MO and M2O3. Although different transition metals were 
introduced, causing the variations in oscillation, a typical resonance could be observed. 
They are characterized by features which can be divided into a pre-edge region A with 
relatively small intensity, a main-edge region B, and resonance peaks C and D 
[150-152]. The pre-edge region [150,153] can be interpreted as an electron transition 
from 1s orbital to unoccupied bound 3d orbitals, of which the peak-split denotes an 
energy splitting of 3d-orbitals into tg and e2g-orbitals caused by symmetrical 
arrangement. The main absorption B can be ascribed [152] to the transition of 1s 
electron to 4p states. The features C and D stem from the ‘shape resonance’ which 
associates with site symmetry, and multi-scattering resonance of photoelectron by 
neighboring atoms, respectively. These oscillation peaks at higher energy are 
suggested sensitive to the second and even higher shell effects. 
For manganese ferrite, a significant deviation in resonant response between 
as-precipitated and calcined powders was observed, indicating either electronic or 
atomic environment was rather different. The energy of absorption edge is strongly 
sensitive to the valence state of absorbing atom and shows an increase with increasing 
the valency. The valency for amorphous phase is much higher than that of calcined 
MnFe2O4 and the spectrum is very close to that of Mn(III)2O3, revealing the valency 
of Mn is almost +3; in the meanwhile, the absorption edge of calcined ferrite was 
red-shifted and thus denoted a valency between +2 and +3 (Fig. 5-4(a)). On the other 
hand, the Fe valency was fairly near +3 and no apparent change was observed. That 
indicates a redistribution of charge associated with a decrease in valence state of Mn 
was detected during the crystallization process. By contrast, the resonances for both 
CoFe2O4 and NiFe2O4 cases did not exhibit such a large difference by introducing 
calcination, as shown in Fig. 5-4(b) and (c). No obvious shift in absorption edge was 
 109
acquired. The intense feature of CoOct-MOct shell reveals that the major portion of Co 
ions was still located in the 16d octahedral sites. However, the relative peak ratio of 
CoOct-MOct to CoOct-MTet shell for spectra acquired at Co K-edge is lower than that for 
NiFe2O4, while an inverse tendency in the FT spectra based on Fe K-edge was 
observed. It is found that CoFe2O4 is not perfect inverse spinel and part of Co ions 
substitute for Fe in the 8a tetrahedral sites, which refers to a mixed spinel structure of 
(CoxFe1-x)[Co1-xFe1+x]O4. By contrast, MnFe2O4 shows a fairly different atomic 
environment even the superposition is still encountered. The contribution 
corresponding to MnOct-MOct interaction was greatly reduced (Fig. 5-5(a)) and the 
FeOct-MOct interaction became dominant (Fig. 5-5(b)). It is suggested that majority of 
Mn ions occupy tetrahedral sites and present MnFe2O4 was predominantly normal 
spinel. 
The curve fitting of EXAFS spectra can give a more precisely quantitative 
elucidation on atomic surroundings. The cases comprising two central absorbing 
atoms, however, present a superposition of radial distributions, and thus the curve 
fitting is very difficult to decouple these two signals and the inevitably large errors 
may be concerned. For NiFe2O4, the FT Ni K-edge spectrum was preferably best 
fitted by the three-shell model based on the arrangement of tetragonal sites. In 
addition, the difference in cation distribution could be also perceived in the pre-edge 
feature of XANES. It shows a weak intensity for octahedral coordination but a 
relatively strong intensity for tetrahedral coordination. Almost no pre-edge feature in 
Ni K-edge XANES for NiFe2O4 refers to NiO6 octahedral construction, in consistent 
with the EXAFS observation. 
 
CV analysis.— For electrochemical characterization, control study was first carried 
out on the Ti current collector and CB, respectively. As described in experimental 
section, CB was used as a conducting additive in the ferrite electrodes. For Ti foil, 
only reduction of H+ and oxidation of OH- occur at -0.2 and 1.05 V with respect to 
Ag/AgCl, respectively in NaCl electrolyte solution, as shown in Fig. 5-6. On the other 
hand, CB electrode exhibits a nearly rectangular current profile, characteristic of 
EDLC (Fig. 5-6), within the potential window of the Ti current collector, and it shows 
a specific capacitance of ~ 10 F/g. As the CB powder has a specific surface area of 
nearly 220 m2/g, this gives a superficial specific capacitance of about 5 µF/cm2. This 
capacitance is lower than that, ca. 10~20 µF/cm2, reported in H2SO4 aqueous

5.3 Basic Characterizations of MnFe2O4/Carbon Black 
Supercapacitors 
MnFe2O4 was shown to exhibit the superior electrochemical performance among 
these four ferrite materials. The further enhancement of capacitive behavior was 
carried out by introducing MnFe2O4/CB composite materials synthesized via one-step 
coprecipitation method similar to the case of single-phased ferrite.  
 
TEM analysis.— Microstructural analyses of electrode materials were first carried out 
prior to fundamental electrochemical characterizations. TEM micrograph of 
MnFe2O4/CB composite powders calcined at 350 oC was presented in Fig. 5-10. Two 
different kinds of primary particles could be distinguished. The CB particles serving 
as the supporting substrate shows granular appearance with sizes ranging from 50 to 
70 nm, while the ferrite particles, which appear dark and randomly dispersed onto CB 
surface, exhibit particle sizes ranging from a few to ~ 10 nm. The sizes of the ferrite 
particles are close to the crystallite size determined by XRD (Fig. 5-11 and Table 5-3), 
indicating that every particle is basically a single crystal. 
 
CV analysis.— Figures 5-12(a) and (b) show the voltammograms of the coprecipitated 
electrodes which are constituted of the co-precipitated MnFe2O4/CB composite 
powders (weight ratio = 1:1) calcined at different temperatures ranging from 50 to 500 
oC. The electrodes can be divided into two categories based on their capacitive 
behaviors. Powders calcined at or below 200 oC do not give capacitive current profiles 
(Fig. 5-12(a)), while those calcined at or above 300 oC result in nearly 
rectangle-shaped current profiles (Fig. 5-12(b)), characteristic of capacitors. For the 
latter, the specific capacitances were again calculated by Eq. (3-5) with integrated 
potential range between 0.0 and 0.7 V, and the contribution of CB (~5 F/g-composite) 
was subtracted. As shown in Table 5-3, the specific capacitance of the MnFe2O4 
component first increases and then decreases with increasing calcination temperature, 
showing the maximum of 102.4 F/g-MnFe2O4 for calcination at 350 oC. As described 
below, the XRD crystallite size of this MnFe2O4 powder is 13.2 nm (Table 5-3), and 
its specific surface area was estimated to be no greater than 91 m2/g, which 
 125
Ag/AgCl. The direction of induced current changed immediately as the potential scan 
reversed at both end, showing an insignificant response delay corresponding to small 
electronic resistance. The anodic current profiles approached a common envelope, 
while the opposite cathodic current curves did not converge on a common curve and 
showed a gradual shrinkage as the potential window decreased. The departure of 
current profiles from the common envelope is suggested to be an important indicator 
of kinetic irreversibility of reaction involved [142]. Therefore, the redox reactions 
involved in MnFe2O4 system is not highly reversible as for RuO2 supercapacitor [142]. 
In addition, the capacitance is a function of potential window, increasing slightly with 
enlarging potential windows. The response is similar to the case of Mo2N 
supercapacitor [81]. 
 
Chronopotentiometric analysis.— The direct current (dc) charge/discharge behavior of 
composite electrode was examined by chronopotentiometry. A nearly ideal capacitive 
response, showing linearity in potential profiles, was acquired at three different charge 
currents (Fig. 5-16). A slight voltage drop or jump at the reversal from charge to 
discharge or reverse order indicates a good overall electronic conductivity of the 
electrode, which is attributed to a well contact of ferrite nanocrystallites and 
conducting CB skeleton. On the other hand, the coulombic efficiency of the capacitor 
was estimated to be higher than 95 % based on the comparison of the 
charge/discharge time under different charge currents. The specific capacitance of a 
single electrode was estimated around 63.4 F/g at a specific charge current of 0.35 
mA/mg, which corresponds to ~115 F/g-MnFe2O4 for the MnFe2O4 component. This 
value is consistent with but slightly larger than that determined from CV analysis. 
This difference results from the change of potential window and a relatively slow 
charge rate. 
 
XRD analysis.— Figure 5-11 shows synchrotron XRD patterns of MnFe2O4/CB 
(weight ratio equals to 1:1) composite powders. The powder is essentially amorphous 
after calcination at 200 oC. On the other hand, all the important reflections of 
MnFe2O4 began to appear after calcination at 300 oC, above which the peaks of the 
ferrite phase were increasingly sharpened, suggesting crystal growth, with increasing 
calcination temperature. The average crystallite sizes are listed in Table 5-3. These 
results indicate that the abrupt change in capacitive behavior as observed between

CV analysis.— The optimization of capacitive performance of MnFe2O4/CB 
supercapacitors was carried out by adjusting the ferrite content. Figure 5-19 shows the 
voltammograms of the coprecipitated electrodes with different compositions acquired 
in NaCl(aq) electrolyte. All the current profiles are still nearly rectangular-shape and 
show characteristics of capacitors. The electrode capacitance does not show a 
monotonic increase but rather first increases and then decreases with increasing the 
ferrite content, and shows a maximum capacitance around 65 F/g for the electrode 
composed of ferrite to CB of 7:3. The specific capacitance of composite electrodes 
calcined at different temperatures was summarized in Fig. 5-20 (a). A similar trend of 
capacitance related to the calcination temperature was observed for the composite 
electrodes with different compositions, where the capacitance reduces as calcination 
temperature increases. 
By subtracting the contribution of CB, the estimated specific capacitance 
associated with MnFe2O4 component was presented in Fig. 5-20 (b). For the cases of 
350 and 400 oC-treated electrodes, the capacitances of MnFe2O4 first increase and 
then almost level off with decreasing the content of MnFe2O4. The level-off 
capacitances for electrodes calcined at 350 and 400 oC are 105 and 75 F/g, 
respectively. This phenomenon can be explained by that when the ferrite content is 
less than a critical fraction, the dispersion of ferrite nanoparticles on CB is better, and 
thus all the ferrites are believed in use. In the meanwhile, the agglomeration of 
MnFe2O4 crystallites is encountered as the content becomes larger (Fig. 5-18), which 
hinders the utility of interior particles and results in the degradation in capacitive 
contribution. On the other hand, the capacitance of all the electrodes calcined at 500 
oC does not significantly vary with the ferrite content and shows a value close to 20 
F/g-MnFe2O4, which suggests that a severe coarsening results in relatively low 
accessible surface area. 
Except for the issue of capacitance, another effect of CB content is the capability 
for high-rate performance. It is indicated that the capacitance in sensitive to the 
potential scan-rate at lower CB content (not shown in the figure), while much less 
capacitance decline is observed for electrodes having higher CB content. It is believed 
that the larger electronic resistance of the coprecipitated electrodes is due to the more 
agglomeration of ferrite particles. 
 
 135
dependent because the pseudocapacitive redox reaction merely takes place within 
surface region. In this case, a dramatic decline, ~ 80%, in capacitance is observed as 
heat treatment increases from 350 to 500 oC. Except for the loss of surface area, the 
deviations in both electronic configuration and atomic environment during 
crystallization process, especially for Mn ions, may contribute to the partial difference 
in capacitance. The electron transfer of pseudocapacitive reactions is indicated mainly 
counterbalanced by the change in Mn valency, between +3 and +2 (the results are 
shown in section 5-6). The reduced state of Mn ions for electrode treated at higher 
temperature is possible to limit the depth of redox reactions, and thus result in a 
relatively small pseudocapacitance.

5.5 Operating Characteristics of MnFe2O4/Carbon Black 
 143
A complementary study was carried out in pH-adjusted 1 M NaCl electrolyte, of 
which pH ranges from 3 to 10. The MnFe2O4/CB coprecipitated electrode showed 
almost the same CVs except for a slight shift in practical potential window restricted 
by decomposition of water (not shown in figure). 
    The tests for capability of high-power delivery and cycle stability were carried 
out by adopting the symmetric-cell configuration. The voltammograms of the 
symmetric cell in different chloride salts solution are shown in Fig. 5-25. The profiles 
are consistent with what can be deduced from the data of the three-electrode 
configuration (Fig. 5-23). The data for the rate dependence of capacitance were 
collected in Fig. 5-26. In general, the rate dependence is insensitive to the type of 
cation in the electrolyte, and it decreases by ~ 15 % as the scan rate increases from 20 
to 200 mV/s, except for the case of KCl showing a less reduction, ~8 %. 
Figure 5-27 depicts the voltammograms of a symmetric cell collected at 
temperature ranging from 0 to 20 oC. All the current profiles still exhibited the 
characteristics of a capacitor but slight reduction in current with decreasing operating 
temperature was noticed. At the scan rate of 20 mV/s, the electrode can provide at 0 
oC ~85 % of the capacitance at 20 oC. Plotting the capacitance versus 1/T gives an 
“apparent” activation energy of 10.3 KJ/mol, which is close to the activation energies 
for equivalent conductivities of alkali ions in aqueous solution. It may suggest that the 
rate-limiting step to the capacitance in the present cell resides in ion diffusion in 
electrolyte solution. 
 
Chronopotentiometric analysis.— Figure 5-28 illustrates the potential curves of the 
symmetric cell composed by two MnFe2O4/CB composite electrodes under constant 
charge currents in NaCl(aq) electrolyte. Upon being charged under a constant current, 
the cell electrodes showed potential increases until reaching a plateau, where the 
applied current is equal to the leakage current. It is found that the leakage current 
dramatically increases as the potential range over 1.0 V, which strongly restricts the 
practical operating potential. With an operating potential of 1 V, the specific leakage 
current is ~10 mA/g, which corresponds to ~0.3 mA/F of a symmetric cell. 
 
Self-discharge analysis.— The self-discharge behavior of the MnFe2O4/CB 
coprecipitated electrode were characterized by recording its open circuit potential 
after the electrode was charged to certain potentials. It was shown that as the potential

5.6 Investigation on Charge Storage Mechanism of MnFe2O4  
In-situ XANES analysis.— Figure 5-31 depicts both the normalized Mn and Fe K-edge 
XANES spectra of the MnFe2O4/CB composite electrode acquired along the cathodic 
sweep of a CV scan from 0.8 to -0.1 V with respect to Ag/AgCl. The typical 
resonance spectra were presented, of which the origin of the features has been 
described in Section 5.4. Almost no deterioration in XAS resonance for electrode 
prior to and after being immersed into the solution-filled cell was observed. For the 
case of Mn, a slight deviation in energy of main absorption edge was detected, while 
the overall profiles did not change with different reduced states. By contrast, the 
change in absorption edge for Fe K-edge spectra is not as clear as that for Mn, but a 
perceived reduction in resonance peaks C and D was observed, especially as the 
potential reduced from 0.1 to -0.1 V. Such deviation in high energy features indicates 
a significant change in the atomic environment associated with the second and higher 
shells around the Fe atoms. Unfortunately, the extended fine structure analysis can not 
be accomplished because the damping at the higher energy region is relatively weak, 
which results from the severe X-ray absorption and scattering by the solution. 
The corresponding energy shift on both Mn and Fe K-edges along the course of 
reduction reaction was depicted in Fig. 5-32. Due to the lack of distinguishability on 
the first inflection energy of the main absorption edge caused by the overlapping, the 
energy shift was defined as the difference between E1/2, the energy measured at 
half-height of the normalized XANES spectra, and E0, energy of the main absorption 
edges associated with metal foils. Along the course of reduction reaction, the 
progressive decrease in Mn valency was observed, indicative of a charge transfer on 
Mn. The main absorption edges of all spectra were very close to that of Mn(III)2O3 
standard even for the reduced state. On the other hand, a multistage for Fe, in which 
the valency mainly reduced at the potential range 0.5 to 0.1 V while it kept constant 
for other regions, was presented. The deviation in absorption energy for Fe ions is far 
less than that for Mn, which suggests that the insertion process contributing to 
pseudocapacitance is predominantly balanced by the reduction of Mn. Therefore, the 
phenomenon, a continuous reduction for Mn ions during the whole cathodic CV 
sweep along with a reduction of Fe ions only in the middle potential range, may 
 151
Mechanism.— The operating potential window of MnFe2O4 is very different from that 
of the Fe3O4 electrode in the aqueous sulfite-containing electrolyte solution. Rather, it 
is very similar to the potential window of MnO2·nH2O in the alkali chloride 
electrolyte solutions. The present XANES data have clearly indicated that the redox 
reactions of the composite powder electrode involve electron transfer at both the Mn 
and Fe ions of MnFe2O4. The OCP data, which show a pH dependence, suggested that 
the reaction may involve H+ either with or without association with water molecule(s). 
In our recent study on the hydrated MnO2·nH2O thin-film electrode by EQCM in 
alkali salt solutions, it was established that the pseudocapacitance mechanism for 
MnO2·nH2O involves bulk insertion of predominantly H3O+, which also gives similar 
pH dependence for OCP. However, the ferrite has exhibited a reversible lattice 
expansion which is merely one tenth of that of MnO2·nH2O. It thus may be argued 
that, for the MnFe2O4 supercapacitor, the inserting proton species is not likely 
associated with any water molecule. The difference may be related to the fact that the 
ferrite phase is a crystalline material, in contrast to the nearly amorphous nature of the 
MnO2 electrode. The latter could have a more open structure, capable of 
accommodating larger inserting cations, such as hydrated proton and alkali cations. In 
addition, the specific surface area of the ferrite crystallites is too small to assume that 
the pseudocapacitance is restrictively a superficial process. Accordingly, the overall 
electrochemical reaction can be written as 
δMn3+ + (1-δ)Fe3+ + H+(aq) + e− → δMn2+ + (1-δ)Fe2+ + H+(lattice)      {5-2}

5.7 Summary  
Among ferrites MFe2O4 where M = Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni, MnFe2O4 has been 
found to exhibit pseudocapacitance in aqueous NaCl solution, while the other ferrites 
do not. Crystallographic and electrochemical data indicate that the unusually large 
capacitances result from the crystalline, rather than amorphous, MnFe2O4 phase. The 
MnFe2O4/CB composite shows pseudocapacitance in solutions of chloride, sulfate and 
sulfite salts of alkali and alkaline cations, with NaCl solution giving the highest 
capacitance. It has shown a gravimetric specific capacitance greater than 100 
F/g-MnFe2O4, or a superficial capacitance of at least 112 µF/cm2, with high-power 
delivering capability. For the chloride electrolytes, the pseudocapacitance is 
associated with charge transfer at both the Mn and Fe sites, predominantly at the Mn 
ions at the tetrahedral sites of the spinel, balanced by insertion of cations from the 
electrolyte and protonation process. In NaCl, the composite electrode exhibits an 
operating potential window of 1.0 V with a maximum leakage current of 10 mA/g, 
and it exhibits superior cycling stability and reduced self-discharge rate than 
amorphous MnO2. The specific capacitance of the composite is a strong function of 
the CB content and the optimum capacitance occurs with the ferrite:CB weight ratio 
of 7:3.

6.2 Preparation of Electroplated MnO2 Thin Film 
Electroplating of MnO2. The thermodynamic equilibrium of the manganese oxides 
with respect to the potential and pH is displayed by Pourbaix’s diagram in Fig. 6-1 
[158]. MnO2 is possible to be directly formed via anodic deposition process from 
Mn(II) aqueous solution, and the stable region of the MnO2 film in rather mild 
electrolytes, of which pH is 7, is about 0.6 to 1.15 V with respect to NHE. In this 
study, anodic deposition of MnO2 was performed under a constant potential of 0.9 V 
(vs. Ag/AgCl). Figure 6-2 shows the current and mass change during the 
electroplating process. It was found that, upon imposing a step potential, the current 
started very high and then quickly dropped to a fairly constant value of ~0.1 mA. 
Concurrently, the mass of the electrode first increased with high rates and then 
linearly with time. Throughout the entire deposition period, the mass-to-charge ratio 
(MCR), which is defined as  
MCR ≡ dM/(dQ/−96500)  (6-1)     
where dM is the differential mass change of the electrode (g) and dQ, the differential 
charge change (coulomb), remains fairly constant at -46.70 g/mol-e-. MCR has the 
physical meaning of the mass gain (or loss) caused by reduction (or oxidation) by 1 
mole of electron (e-). If the ratio has a negative sign, species is added onto the 
working electrode upon oxidation. This is exactly the case for anodic plating. 
The anodic plating reaction in the present study, which uses Mn(II) salt as the 
starting reagent, can nominally be expressed as  
Mn2+ + 2H2O ↔ MnO2 + 4H+ + 2e-                             {6-1}     
which has a theoretical MCR of -43.47. The magnitude of the measured MCR (46.7) 
is close to the theoretical value. This suggests that the plating process indeed involves 
a two-electron transfer mechanism as written. On the other hand, the difference 
between the ratios may also suggest that the plated MnO2 film is not stoichiometric 
but has a larger formula weight than MnO2. This difference is believed to arise from

6.3 Investigation on Charge Storage Behavior of MnO2 
EQCM study. Figure 6-5(a) shows the cyclic voltammograms of the film electrode 
in 1M NaCl aqueous solution. Analyses using the thin-film electrode were limited by 
a cathodic potential end of 0.5 V, below which the oxide films tended to detach from 
the Au substrate in some cases. The detachment presumably results from volume 
(lattice) expansion of the oxide film during reduction, which, as described later, was 
evidenced by synchrotron XRD. As shown in Fig. 6-5(a), the voltammograms showed 
an almost ideal rectangle profile, consistent with the literature using the powder 
electrodes. The line profile is quite different from that exhibited by RuO2·nH2O 
electrode in sulfuric acid solution, which typically shows profiles containing multiple 
redox humps [136]. The specific capacitances are 224 and 199 F/g at 10 and 50 mV/s, 
respectively (Table 6-1). Figure 6-5(b) shows the accumulative charge (∆Q; “−” sign 
for reduction) curves for different scan rates, which were calculated by integrating the 
current data. The closed-loop nature of the ∆Q curves indicates that the charge 
transferred during the cathodic scan is totally released during the anodic scan. The 
slight separation of the anodic and cathodic braches of the ∆Q loops results from the 
delay in current response on voltage reversal at the potential ends.  
Figure 6-5(c) plots the accumulated mass change (∆M) versus charge (∆Q). 
Firstly, all the curves are close-loop in nature, suggesting that all the species 
incorporated into the electrode were eventually released from electrode after every 
CV cycle. Secondly, the curves of different scan rates overlapped with one another, 
suggesting that neither the operating species nor the reaction mechanism is affected by 
the scan rate. Thirdly, all the curves are essentially linear lines with a mean MCR, as 
defined by Eq. (6-1), of 18.7 (±0.7) g/mol-e−. The simple linearity of the curves 
indicates only one-stage redox reaction occurring. This is in contrast with the case of 
RuO2·nH2O, which exhibited regions of different MCRs due to the occurrence of 
multiple-stage redox reactions [136]. Furthermore, the positive sign of the MCR 
implies a cation-, but not anion-, operating redox reaction. It is noted that the MCR 
value (18.7 g/mol-e−) is nothing close to the atomic weight of either H (1.0 g/mol) or 
Na (23 g/mol). 
 The same studies as described above have also been carried out in LiCl, KCl, 
 165
with a molar fraction of 1%. The absence of Na signal in this case did indicate that 
Na+ was not incorporated into the oxide film during reduction. The data also serve to 
illustrate that the residue electrolyte salts can be efficiently removed from the 
electrode surface by the rinsing procedure adopted, and they do not impose 
controversy in data interpretation. In contrast to NaCl and LiCl solutions, for 
electrodes reduced in other electrolyte solutions, including KCl, CsCl, and CaCl2 
solutions, the XPS peaks of the corresponding cations were vividly detected (Fig. 
6-7(c)~(e)).  
 
In-situ synchrotron XRD analysis. Synchrotron XRD pattern of the MnO2⋅nH2O 
particles is shown in Fig. 6-3 (curve b). The pattern can also be indexed with the 
ε-MnO2 structure [159] with a= 2.797 nm, and c= 4.419 nm. That is, the particles 
basically have the same lattice structure as the electroplated films except that the 
former has smaller lattice parameters, presumably because of different water contents. 
The pattern, however, is distinctly different from that shown in Ref. 52, which was 
assigned to the α- MnO2 structure.  
Under CV analysis, the particle electrodes exhibited rectangular current profiles 
(Fig. 6-8), of the same characteristics as those of the film electrodes. Particularly, 
there is also no redox humps throughout the scan potential range (0.0~1.0 V). The 
great similarities in oxide crystal structure and CV response between the powder and 
thin-film electrodes lead us to believe that the same mechanism would take place for 
both of them and their data are complementary to each other.  
For in-situ synchrotron XRD patterns, the reflections of the Ti current collector 
are taken as the internal standards. In all the electrolyte solutions employed, the peaks 
of the MnO2·nH2O particles were clearly seen to shift back and forth upon CV cycling. 
Two examples, those for the NaCl and KCl solutions, are shown in Fig. 6-9. In both 
cases, the (100) peak of the MnO2·nH2O particles was shown to shift toward lower 
angle, suggesting lattice expansion, during the cathodic scan, and then back to the 
original positions during the anodic scan. The structural variation is completely 
reversible. The extent of lattice expansion of this reflection is ~10 % per mole of 
electron transferred for both solutions. The observed lattice expansion indicates that 
pseudocapacitance of MnO2·nH2O involves intercalation or insertion of cations into 
the bulk of the oxide structure, but not merely surface adsorption.  
 167
main FT peaks locating at radial distance less than 4 Å were observed. The first peak 
at around 1.5 Å corresponds to the Mn-O interaction in the first coordination shell, 
and the second and third shells at 2.5 and 3.1 Å are both ascribed to the Mn-Mn 
interactions. The relative low amplitude of peaks corresponding to Mn-Mn interaction 
indicates the lack of long-range ordering for amorphous nature of MnO2. All the FT 
peaks did not significantly change with the extent of reduction, but only showed a 
decrease in peak amplitude as the reduction process occurred, which indicates that the 
MnO2 skeleton did not be destroyed during the insertion process. The result is 
different from the case of amorphous RuO2, in which the disappearance of the second 
shell ascribed to Ru-Ru interactions was observed as the material was reduced [132]. 
However, the reduction of peak amplitudes may be attributed to several factors. First, 
the partial MnO2 lattices were expanded, which causes the deviation in coordination 
lengths for each shell, and thus results in the decreasing amplitude. Second, the 
existence of inserted species also causes additional resonances, of which the locations 
are not precisely specified, and a destructive interference may occur. Besides, the 
portion of Mn3+ ions become larger at the reduced states. However, the Mn3+ ion is 
believed to be a d4 Jahn-Teller ion, an inevitable distortion of the MnO6 octahedra is 
expected, and therefore, a change in FT peaks may be observed. 
 
Mechanism. Pseudocapacitance of MnO2·nH2O in alkali salt solutions has been 
attributed to either chemisorption of alkali cation or protonation reaction, balancing 
valence variation at the Mn sites. The former is expected to give a MCR equal to the 
equivalent weight of the alkali ion, while the later should give a MCR of +1. As 
shown in Table 6-2, none of the measured MCRs matches the equivalent weight of 
either H+ or alkali ions.  
 For NaCl solution, XPS did not detect Na. in the reduced MnO2·nH2O electrode. 
This result is consistent to a large extent with Bélanger et al. [137], who have shown 
in a similar experiment that the Na content is far less than what is to account for the 
total amount of charge transferred. The measured MCR, 18.7 for charging/discharging 
in NaCl, can be considered equal to the equivalent weight (19.0) of oxonium, H3O+, 
within experimental error. In fact, the MCRs for LiCl, KCl and CaCl2 solutions, which 
are between 16.2 and 21.6, are also close to this value. These results lead us to 
propose that the pseudocapacitance of MnO2·nH2O in NaCl solution involves almost 
 169
insertion of either H3O+ or alkali cations would result from the balance between these 
two opposing factors. The lattice expansion factor may explain a decrease in insertion 
with increasing ionic size from Li+ to Na+. On the other hand, the dehydration factor 
may account for the subsequent increase in insertion with further increasing ionic size 
from Na+ to Cs+. The reaction schemes for insertion of H3O+ and concurrent process 
of alkali ion upon reduction can be expressed as  
Mn(IV)O2·nH2O + δ e- + δ H3O+ ↔ (H3O)δ [Mn(III)δMn(IV)1-δ]O2·nH2O  {6-2}    
The concurrent insertion of the alkali ion can be similarly expressed as 
Mn(IV)O2·nH2O + δ e- + δ M+ ↔ Mδ [Mn(III)δMn(IV)1-δ]O2·nH2O       {6-3} 
where M+ is an alkali cation. 
 The OCP of a thin-film electrode was measured as a function of pH value in a 
1M NaCl solution. The pH value of the solution was increased stepwise with an 
increment ∆pH of ~0.5, and the OCP was taken 30 min after the pH change. As shown 
in Fig. 6-12, the OCP-pH correlation gives a slope, dE/dpH, of -65.0 mV, which is 
very close to the theoretical value (-59.2 mV) for Reaction {6-2}. 
 Finally, it is worth noting that, the present MnO2·nH2O films and particles 
possess the ε-MnO2-type crystal structure. ε-MnO2 has the space group of P63/mmc. 
Mn ions are located at 2a (0, 0, 0; 0, 0, 1/2) sites with half occupancy, and O at 2c (1/3, 
2/3, 1/4; 2/3, 1/3, 3/4) sites. By orderly arranging the Mn ions at 2a sites between 
neighboring unit cells, one is able to generate superstructures corresponding to those 
of pyrolusite (β-MnO2) and ramsdellite, along with other structures that possess 
tunnels parallel to edge-shared MnO6 octahedron chains with rectangular- or square- 
shaped cross-sections that are n octahedra by m octahedra on a side. The structures of 
the present MnO2·nH2O samples are likely the intergrowth of these superstructures, 
and the larger tunnels could easily accommodate the inserting cations and water 
molecules [125].

6.4 Summary 
The pseudocapacitive charge storage reactions of MnO2·nH2O in several alkali 
and alkaline salts solutions have been investigated mainly by EQCM, XPS, 
synchrotron XRD and XAS. It has been established that charge transfer at the Mn 
sites upon reduction/oxidation is balanced by insertion/extraction of the solution 
cations into/from the oxide structure. H3O+ plays the predominant (> 60 %) role in all 
cases, and the extent of participation for alkali cations first decrease and then 
increases with ionic size. The charge-storage reaction can be summarized as:  
Mn(IV)O2·nH2O + δ e- + δ(1-f) H3O+ + δf M+ ↔ 
(H3O)δ(1-f)Mδf[Mn(III)δMn(IV)1-δ]O2·nH2O, where M+ is alkali cation. 
 
 
 
 183
As to the charge-storage mechanism of pseudocapacitor, there is still controversy 
for most of pseudocapacitor materials because of the lack of complete investigative 
techniques. In this study, we adopted various analytical examinations to investigate 
the mechanism of MnO2 supercapacitor and attempted to build up an investigation 
procedure. With the proficiency on techniques, we hope that these analytical methods 
can be further applied to other pseudocapacitor systems, and thus the results may be 
helpful for follow-up improvements on capacitive performance.

Abstract 
Ferrites including MFe2O4 where M = Mn, Fe, Co, or Ni, have been synthesized by 
solution methods and tested for their capacitive behaviors in aqueous NaCl solution. 
MnFe2O4 has been found to exhibit unusually large capacitances, while the rest 
ferrites do not. The results indicate unique pseudocapacitive property associated with 
the Mn+2 ions at the tetrahedral sites in the spinel structure. The pseudocapacitance 
was observed only for crystalline, rather than amorphous, MnFe2O4 phase, which has 
exhibited a specific capacitance of  >100 F/g and high-powder delivering capability 
>10 KW/Kg.

residual ions. The powder was prepared by drying the precipitate at 50 oC. A 
subsequent calcination process for MFe2O4 was carried out at different temperatures 
for 2 h in N2 atmosphere.  
Ferrite/CB (1:1 by weight) composite powders have also been synthesized via a 
similar process except that CB powder was introduced in the starting aqueous solution 
prior to the precipitation step. It was found that all the CB precipitated simultaneously 
with the oxide precursor, suggesting that the oxide component was homogeneously 
combined with CB particles during the synthesis process. 
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on Mac-Science/MXP 
diffractometer with Cu kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm), while synchrotron XRD (λ = 
0.061993 nm) was carried out by using beam-line 01-C2 facilities of National 
Synchrotron Radiation Research Center in Taiwan, R.O.C.. Micrographs were taken 
on a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi-S800). BET surface areas were 
determined by nitrogen adsorption (ASAP 2000, Micrometrics). 
Two types of composite electrodes constituted of the ferrites and conductive 
carbon black (CB; VULCAN XC72, Cabot Corp., U.S.A.) have been prepared for 
characterization. The first type, which will be referred to as the “mixed” electrode, 
consists of the ferrite particles and CB powder with a weight ratio of 9:1 mixed by 
mechanical grinding. The second type, referred to as the “coprecipitated” electrode, 
was made of the ferrite/CB (1:1 by weight) composite powders that were formed by 
the co-precipitation process described above. PVdF in 10 wt.% was used as the binder 
for both electrodes and Ti foil was used as the current collector. The electrodes were 
finally dried at 120 oC for 6 h in vacuum.  
Electrochemical characterizations were carried out with a three-electrode cell 
with Pt mesh and Ag/AgCl/saturated KCl (EG&G, 197mV vs. NHE at 25 oC) as the 
counter and reference electrode, respectively. The testing electrolyte was 1 M NaCl 
aqueous solution, unless otherwise specified. The cyclic voltammetry was recorded by 
an electrochemical analyzer (Eco Chemie PGSTAT30). The average specific 
capacitance of the electrodes was calculated by: 
Cavg = ∆Q/w∆V = (∫ I dV)/s/∆V/w (1), 
where ∆Q is the total amount of charge accumulated over a potential window ∆V, w, 
the mass of active material in an electrode, I, the current, and s, the potential 
scan-rate. 
 
Results and Discussion 
Fig. 1 shows the powder XRD patterns of the synthesized ferrites, including 
MnFe2O4, Fe3O4, CoFe2O4, and NiFe2O4. All the powders are single-phased, 
exhibiting spinel structure having the same space group, O7h-Fd3m. These ferrites 
show different ability of crystallization. Fe3O4 is the only one that is capable of fully 
crystallizing during the precipitation process in solution, and it shows an average 
crystallite size of 9.5 nm, as determined by Debye-Scherrer equation based on the 
(311) diffraction peak (Table 1). On the other hand, the other ferrites were amorphous 
as precipitated and subsequently crystallized during calcination in N2 at elevated 
temperatures. The crystallite sizes of the ferrite powders calcined at 600 0C are listed 
in Table 1. SEM micrographs (Fig. 2) show that the ferrite powders contain granular 
particles with fairly uniform diameters of about 50 nm. No apparent difference in 
either particle size or morphology among these samples was observed. The particle 
sizes are larger than the crystallite sizes determined from XRD, suggesting that the 
particles are composed of several crystallites.  
For electrochemical characterization, control study was first carried out on the Ti 
 205
MnFe2O4/CB electrode has a practical operating potential range that is identical to 
that of the Ti current collector shown in Fig. 2. Another important property of this 
electrode is that it is capable of delivering rather high capacitance under high-power 
conditions. Fig. 6 showed the voltammograms of a two-electrode cell of the 
co-precipitated MnFe2O4/CB electrodes. The capacitive current (at 0.0 V) was found 
to decrease by merely 22% when the potential-scan rate increases by a factor of 10, 
from 20 mV/s to 200 mV/s. At 200 mV/s, the composite electrode delivers a 
maximum specific power of 8.7 KW/Kg-composite. By subtracting the contribution 
from CB as described before, the MnFe2O4 component was found to deliver 15.4 
KW/Kg- MnFe2O4.  
Synchrotron XRD analysis (Fig. 7) shows that the powder is essentially 
amorphous after calcination at 200 oC. On the other hand, all the important reflections 
of MnFe2O4 began to appear after calcination at 300 oC, above which the peaks of the 
ferrite phase are increasingly sharpened, suggesting crystal growth, with increasing 
calcination temperature. The average crystallite sizes are listed in Table 2. These 
results indicate that the abrupt change in capacitive behavior as observed between 
powders calcined at 200 and 300 oC is associated with the formation of crystalline 
MnFe2O4. That is, it is crystalline MnFe2O4 that is responsible for the large 
capacitance. The further increase in capacitance from 300 to 350 oC can thus be 
attributed to improved crystallinity of existing MnFe2O4 crystallites, while the 
subsequent decline in capacitance at higher temperatures is due to loss in surface area 
of the crystallites caused by crystal coarsening and sintering.  
The voltammograms of both the mixed and co-precipiated MnFe2O4 electrodes 
showed a couple of broad humps (Fig. 4 and 5b), indicative of the occurrence of some 
sort of faradaic reactions. That is, the unusually large capacitance exhibited by 
MnFe2O4 is pseudocapacitance in nature. From the comparison among different 
ferrites shown in Table 1, it is clear that Mn ion must play an important role in causing 
the pseudocapacitive behaviors. MnFe2O4 is known to have a normal spinel structure 
where Mn+2 ions predominantly occupy the tetragonal sites surrounded by O2−. This is 
in contrast to the rest ferrites shown in Table 1, which have the inverse spinel structure 
with the corresponding divalent ions, including Ni+2, Co+2, and Fe+2, occupying the 
octahedral sites. It is also worth mentioning that, although not shown, MnFe2O4 has 
also been found to exhibit large capacitances in K+-containing electrolytes as well. 
This is very similar to the case of pseudocapacitance of MnO2, which is known to 
result from electron-transfer at the Mn ions balanced by intercalation of cations, 
namely Na+ and K+ [7,8]. It is conjectured at this point that the pseudocapacitance of 
MnFe2O4 might involve a similar mechanism. However, the major difference is that 
such reactions are feasible even when MnO2 is amorphous, but in the ferrite, the 
electron-transfer process appears possible only by the particular environment 
associated with the tetrahedral sites in the spinel structure. Clearly further research is 
needed to unequivocally unravel the pseudocapacitance mechanism.  
 
Conclusion 
Among ferrites MFe2O4 where M = Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni, MnFe2O4 has been 
found to exhibit pseudocapacitance in aqueous NaCl solution, while the rest ferrites 
do not. Crystallographic and electrochemical data indicates that the unusually large 
capacitances result from the crystalline, rather than amorphous, MnFe2O4 phase, 
which has shown a gravimetric specific capacitance greater than 100 F/g, or a 
superficial capacitance of at least 112 µF/cm2, with an operating window of nearly 1.2 
V and high-power delivering capability. The pseudocapacitive behavior is suggested

Introduction 
Electrochemical capacitor is a promising energy storage device for meeting the 
high-power electric market [1-3]. Complementary to battery, electrochemical 
capacitor can provide superior power density and cyclability, and can be regarded as 
an intermediate device between the traditional ceramic capacitors and batteries. 
Electrochemical capacitors are generally categorized into two types based on the 
charge-storage mechanism. The electric double-layer capacitance (EDLC) arises from 
electrostatic separation of charges at the interface between electrode and electrolyte. 
On the other hand, pseudocapacitance, typically more than ten times greater than 
EDLC, results from either superficial or multi-electron-transfer faradaic reactions 
with fast charge/discharge properties. 
Although hydrated amorphous ruthenium oxide, RuO2·xH2O, has been 
demonstrated in different forms to exhibit high specific capacitance in aqueous H2SO4, 
and superior conductivities [4-6], its extraordinary cost limits potential commercial 
applications. Therefore, much research has been focused on the development of 
pseudocapacitive materials of lower cost. MnO2, because of its low cost and 
environmental benignity, has drawn much attention recently [7-11]. Lee and 
Goodenough [7,8] first reported that amorphous manganese oxide (a-MnO2·nH2O) 
particles synthesized via reduction of potassium permanganate with manganese 
acetate exhibits a capacitance of ca. 200 F/g. While higher capacitances have been 
reported for the thin-film type of electrodes [9-11], they are unlikely commercially 
viable because of slow process throughput. The pseudocapacitance of MnO2 is 
believed to result from multi-electron transfer at Mn cation sites, balanced by 
intercalation/extraction of alkaline cations within the oxide structure [7, 8]. It is worth 
noticing that, it is the amorphous phase that exhibits the largest capacitances and 
dramatic reduction in capacitance occurs with increasing crystallinity. 
Fe3O4 is another recently discovered inexpensive electrode material, exhibiting 
pseudocapacitance within alkali sulfites and sulfates electrolytes [12-14]. The 
capacitance, distinct from the cation-intercalaion reaction, was found to be sensitive to 
electrolyte anions and gave a capacitance ranging from 30 to 510 F/g, depending on 
the dispersion of the oxide crystallites [12]. There are also known several ferrites 
bearing the same common formula, namely MFe2O4, as and similar crystal structures 
to Fe3O4 (or FeFe2O4). This study was originally motivated to investigate the 
pseudocapacitive behaviors of these ferrite materials. In brief, among MnFe2O4, Fe3O4, 
CoFe2O4 and NiFe2O4, MnFe2O4 was found to exhibit unusually large capacitances in 
NaCl electrolyte, and its capacitive characteristics suggests a pseudocapacitance 
mechanism completely different from that of Fe3O4 but close to that of MnO2. This 
new pseudocapacitive ferrite exhibits favorable properties for high-power 
applications. 
 
Experimental 
Ferrites, including MFe2O4 where M = Mn, Fe, Co or Ni, were synthesized via a 
precipitation technique in basic aqueous solutions as follows. Either MCl2 (M = Fe, 
Co and Ni) or MnSO4 was dissolved along with FeCl3 with a stoichiometric ratio of 2: 
1 in 1 M HCl aqueous solution with bubbling N2. When the solution was added with a 
1.5 M NaOH solution under vigorous stirring, either black or dark-brownish 
precipitate was formed immediately. Once the precipitate sedimented, the supernatant 
liquid was decanted and fresh de-ionized water was added. The consecutive 
solution-decanting and water-replenishing processes were carried out to remove 
 7
current collector and CB, respectively. As described earlier, CB was used as a 
conducting additive in the ferrite electrodes. For Ti foil (Fig. 3), only reduction of H+ 
and oxidation of OH- occur at -0.2 and 1.05 V, respectively. On the other hand, CB 
electrode exhibits a nearly rectangular current profile, characteristic of EDLC (Fig. 3), 
within the potential window of the Ti current collector, and it shows a specific 
capacitance of ~ 10 F/g. As the CB powder has a specific surface area of nearly 200 
m2/g, this gives a superficial specific capacitance of about 5 µF/cm2. This capacitance 
is lower than that, ca. 10~20 µF/cm2, reported in H2SO4 (aq) electrolyte [15]. This may 
be because the ions in the present electrolyte solution have larger radii than proton, 
and a part of surface area within micropores of CB becomes inaccessible. 
 Figure 4 compares the voltammograms of the mixed electrodes for each of the 
ferrite powders that have been calcined at 600 oC. Apparently, these ferrites exhibit 
very much different capacitive behaviors in aqueous NaCl. The average capacitances 
of the electrodes have been calculated from eq. (1) within the integrated potential 
range between 0.0 and 0.7 V (to disregard the transition regions upon reversal of 
potential-scan), and the capacitances due to the ferrites were estimated by subtracting 
the contribution of CB, which is ~1.0 F per gram of the mixture of ferrite and CB. As 
summarized in Table 1, NiFe2O4 and Fe3O4 exhibit negligible (< 1.5 F/g) capacitances. 
CoFe2O4 provides a moderate gravimetric specific capacitance up to 7.0 F/g, while 
MnFe2O4 shows the largest capacitance of 14.9 F/g with a fairly rectangular current 
profile (Fig. 4). Taking into account of the BET surface area data of the ferrite 
particles (Table 1) gives superficial specific capacitances of 23.5 and 64.4 µF/cm2 for 
CoFe2O4 and MnFe2O4, respectively. The latter is more than ten times that of CB. As 
shown below, the capacitance of MnFe2O4 can be further enhanced by lowering the 
calcination temperature.  
Figures 5a and b show the voltammograms of the co-precipitated electrodes 
which are constituted of the co-precipitated MnFe2O4/CB composite powders calcined 
at different temperatures from 50 to 500 oC. The electrodes can be divided into two 
categories based on their capacitive behaviors. Powders calcined at or below 200 oC 
do not give capacitive current profiles (Fig. 5a), while those calcined at or above 300 
oC results in rectangle-shaped current profiles (Fig. 5b), characteristic of capacitors. 
For the latter, the specific capacitances were again calculated from eq. (1) with 
integrated potential range between 0.0 and 0.7 V, and the contribution of CB (~5 
F/g-composite) was subtracted. As shown in Table 2, the specific capacitance of the 
MnFe2O4 component first increase and then decrease with increasing calcination 
temperature, showing the maximum of 102 F/g- MnFe2O4 for calcination at 350 oC.  
As described latter, the XRD crystallite size of this MnFe2O4 powder is 13.2 nm 
(Table 2), and its specific surface area was estimated to be no greater than 91 m2/g, 
which corresponds to the specific surface area of non-agglomerated crystallites. This 
gives a superficial capacitance of at least 112 µF/cm2 for the 350 oC-calcined 
MnFe2O4 crystallites.  This value is much larger than that (64.4 µF/cm2) of the mixed 
electrode of MnFe2O4, and the reasons may be of several folds. For one, the 
co-precipitation approach may allow the ferrite crystallites to be better dispersed 
and/or in more close contact with the conductive CB component as compared with 
physical grinding. For another, the capacitance in the mixed electrode may be limited 
by the lack of electrolyte ions, as pointed out by Zheng [5] for ruthenium oxide 
electrodes, and the additional CB in the co-precipitated electrode could serve as an 
electrolyte reservoir to provide sufficient electrolyte ions. The optimum CB content 
has yet to be determined. 
By gradually increasing the potential-scan range, it is determined that the 
 9
to arise from electron-transfer at the Mn ions at the tetrahedral sites of the spinel, 
balanced by intercalation of cations, such as Na+ and K+, from the electrolyte.
