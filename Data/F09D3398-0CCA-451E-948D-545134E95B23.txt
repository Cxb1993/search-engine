wireless communications. Conventionally, the information security is addressed through the use of 
application-level techniques such as user authentication or cryptography. However, these methods may be 
subject to vulnerabilities and difficulties in key distribution and management, especially in highly dynamic 
wireless networks. Recent developments in physical-layer secrecy have shown that this information security 
problem can also be handled in the physical layer by directly exploiting different fading characteristics 
between the legitimate and unauthorized receivers’ channels. It has been shown that the transmitter can 
reliably broadcast information-bearing signals to the legitimate receiver and meanwhile, effectively 
preventing the unauthorized receiver from inferring any information from the information-bearing signals if 
QoS discrimination between the legitimate and the unauthorized receivers can be guaranteed. These 
physical-layer techniques, therefore, can provide information security without involving any complex key 
exchange and management. Besides, they can be used as a complement to higher-layer security techniques. 
For example, one can use these physical-layer secrecy techniques to strengthen the security of the key 
exchanging process. In view of this, we aim to devise advanced signal processing techniques for enhancing 
the QoS discrimination between legitimate and unauthorized receivers. 
Thirdly, while the combination of BICM, OSTBC and OFDM has been shown to be able to achieve 
maximum spatial-frequency diversity in frequency selective multi-path fading channels, this design requires 
perfect channel state information at the receiver. However, this can be achieved only if the receiver has been 
well trained through a sufficient amount of training or pilot data. Such training or pilot-aided schemes work 
well under slow time-varying channels, but may be inefficient under fast time-varying channels, which 
induces much more training or pilot overhead. To improve the spectral efficiency, noncoherent data 
detection and blind/semiblind channel estimation methods have been proposed. However, the noncoherent 
decoder may suffer from the data ambiguity problem in the noise-free situation. The above considerations 
motivate us to develop a noncoherent BICM-OSTBC-OFDM decoder that achieves perfect channel 
identifiability and exploits full noncoherent spatial and frequency diversities. 
Fourthly, the two-way relay strategies have drawn extensive attention because of its potential to achieve 
higher spectrum efficiency than the one-way relay strategies. For OFDM two-way DF relay networks, most 
of the existing works focus on per-subcarrier DF relay strategy, which treats each subcarrier as a separate 
two-way relay channel, and performs independent channel coding over each subcarrier. The per-subcarrier 
DF relay strategy is suitable for practical networks because of its low-complexity. However, the achievable 
rate performance loss of the suboptimal per-subcarrier DF relay strategy may not be small. We are thus 
motivated to study the achievable rate region of the multi-subcarrier DF relay strategy, and then develop 
low-complexity resource allocation algorithms to magnify the efficiency of the scarce spectral resource.

Abstract: Multicell coordinated beamforming (MCBF), where multiple base stations (BSs) collaborate with 
each other in the beamforming design for mitigating the intercell interference (ICI), has been a subject 
drawing great attention recently. Most 
MCBF designs assume perfect channel state information (CSI) of mobile stations (MSs); however CSI 
errors are inevitable at the BSs in practice. Assuming elliptically bounded CSI errors, this paper studies the 
robust MCBF design problem that minimizes the weighted sum power of BSs subject to worst-case 
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints on the MSs. Our goal is to devise a distributed 
optimization method to obtain the worst-case robust beamforming solutions in a decentralized fashion with 
only local CSI used at each BS and limited backhaul information exchange between BSs. However, the 
considered problem is difﬁcult to handle even in the centralized form. We ﬁrst propose an efﬁcient 
approximation method for solving the nonconvex centralized problem, using semideﬁnite relaxation (SDR), 
an approximation technique based on convex optimization. Then a distributed robust MCBF algorithm is 
further proposed, using a distributed convex optimization technique known as alternating direction method 
of multipliers (ADMM). We analytically show the convergence of the proposed distributed robust MCBF 
algorithm to the optimal centralized solution. We also extend the worst-case robust beamforming design as 
well as its decentralized implementation method to a fully coordinated scenario. Simulation results are 
presented to examine the effectiveness of the proposed SDR method and the distributed robust MCBF 
algorithm.

Abstract: Optimal power allocation for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) wiretap 
channels with Gaussian channel inputs has already been studied in some previous works from an 
information theoretical viewpoint. However, these results are not sufﬁcient for practical system designs. One 
reason is that discrete channel inputs, such as quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signals, instead of 
Gaussian channel inputs, are deployed in current practical wireless systems to maintain moderate peak 
transmission power and receiver complexity. In this paper, we investigate the power allocation and artiﬁcial

receiver (UR), we propose a multi-stage training-based discriminatory channel estimation (DCE) scheme 
that aims to optimize the channel estimation performance of the LR while limiting the channel estimation 
performance of the UR. The key idea is to exploit the channel estimate fed back from the LR at the 
beginning of each stage to enable the judicious use of artiﬁcial noise (AN) in the training signal. Speciﬁcally, 
with knowledge of the LR’s channel, AN can be properly superimposed with the training data to degrade the 
UR’s channel without causing strong interference on the LR. The channel estimation performance of the LR 
in earlier stages may not be satisfactory due to the inaccuracy of the channel estimate and constraints on the 
UR’s estimation performance, but can improve rapidly in later stages as the quality of channel estimate 
improves. The training data power and AN power are optimally allocated by minimizing the normalized 
mean-square error (NMSE) of the LR subject to a lower limit constraint on the NMSE of the UR. The 
proposed DCE scheme is then extended to the case with multiple LRs and multiple URs. Simulation results 
are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DCE scheme.

OSTBC-OFDM with maximum spatial-frequency diversity,” IEEE Trans. Wireless Communications, 
vol. 11, no. 9, pp. 3335-3347, Sep. 2012. 
 
Abstract: The combination of bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM), orthogonal space-time block 
coding (OSTBC) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been shown recently to be 
able to achieve maximum spatial-frequency diversity in frequency selective multi-path fading channels, 
provided that perfect channel state information (CSI) is available to the receiver. In view of the fact that 
perfect CSI can be obtained only if a sufﬁcient amount of resource is allocated for training or pilot data, this 
paper investigates pilot-efﬁcient noncoherent decoding methods for the BICM-OSTBC-OFDM system. In 
particular, we propose a noncoherent maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder that uses only one OSTBC-OFDM 
block. This blockwise decoder is suitable for relatively fast fading channels whose coherence time may be as 
short as one OSTBC-OFDM block. Our focus is mainly on noncoherent diversity analysis. We study a class 
of carefully designed transmission schemes, called perfect channel identiﬁability (PCI) achieving schemes, 
and show that they can exhibit good diversity performance. Speciﬁcally, we present a worst-case diversity 
analysis framework to show that PCI-achieving schemes can achieve the maximum noncoherent 
spatial-frequency diversity of BICM-OSTBC-OFDM. The developments are further extended to a 
distributed BICM-OSTBCOFDM scenario in cooperative relay networks. Simulation results are presented to 
conﬁrm our theoretical claims and show that the proposed noncoherent schemes can exhibit near-coherent 
performance.

Robust MISO Transmit Optimization under
Outage-Based QoS Constraints in
Two-Tier Heterogeneous Networks
Kun-Yu Wang, Neil Jacklin, Zhi Ding, Fellow, IEEE, and Chong-Yung Chi, Senior Member, IEEE
Abstract—To improve wireless heterogeneous network service
via macrocell and femtocells that share certain spectral resources,
this paper studies the transmit beamforming design for femtocell
base station (FBS), equipped with multiple antennas, under an
outage-based quality-of-service (QoS) constraint at the single-
antenna femtocell user equipment characterized by its signal-
to-interference-plus-noise ratio. Specifically, we focus on the
practical case of imperfect downlink multiple-input single-output
(MISO) channel state information (CSI) at the FBS due to
limited CSI feedback or CSI estimation errors. By characterizing
the CSI uncertainty probabilistically, we formulate an outage-
based robust beamforming design. This nonconvex optimization
problem can be relaxed into a convex semidefinite programming
problem, which reduces to a power control problem when all
CSI vectors are independent and identically distributed. We
also investigate the performance gap between the optimal trans-
mission strategy (that allows maximum transmission degrees of
freedom (DoF) equal to the number of transmit antennas) and
the proposed optimal beamforming design (with the DoF equal
to one) and provide some feasibility conditions, followed by their
performance evaluation and trade-off through simulation results.

I. INTRODUCTION
FEMTOCELLS, whose services are made possible byoperator-certified home base stations, are low power
cellular access points and have been recognized as a cost-
effective way to strengthen cellular network coverage and
to provide good quality of service (QoS) to mostly indoor
data users. The general concept of femtocells can be found
in [1], [2] and the references therein. Femtocell deployment
is used to improve spectrum efficiency by letting femtocell
and macrocell share and access some common spectrum.
Spectral sharing between femtocell users and macrocell users
will inevitably lead to mutual interference. Such interference

may significantly degrade users’ QoS at the femtocell and
macrocell [3]. For this reason, interference management at
femtocell is one of the key issues in femtocell-augmented
heterogeneous networks [1]–[5].
In [4], a downlink femtocell beamforming design is con-
sidered for minimizing the total transmit power under signal-
to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and interference con-
straints on multiple-input single-output (MISO) channels. In
general, optimizing beamforming vector subject to the SINR
and interference constraints is not a convex optimization
problem. However, it has been shown that the problem can
be equivalently reformulated into a convex second-order cone
program (SOCP); thus the optimal beamformer can be effi-
ciently obtained [4], [6]. It has been shown in [7] that the
optimal beamformer can also be iteratively solved by uplink-
downlink duality. In addition, one can also solve the problem
by applying semidefinite relaxation (SDR) [8]. These methods
offer various advantages in terms of computational complexity,
and offer different implications both in theory and in practical
implementations.
Transmit beamforming has been considered as an efficient
approach to interference management at femtocell downlink
transmission given channel state information (CSI). Many
conventional interference management methods such as those
reported in [4], [5], and [7] are based on the assumption of
perfect CSI at basestation transmitters. Unfortunately, perfect
CSI is never available in practice. There are several reasons
for the lack of perfect CSI at transmitters in frequency division
duplex (FDD) systems. First, in fast fading environment,
receivers may not have sufficient time or bandwidth to provide
an accurate estimate of the time-varying channel. Second,
even when channel fading is moderate, channel estimation
errors at the receiver and limited feedback bandwidth make the
transmitter impossible to acquire perfect CSI knowledge [9].
Although in time division duplex (TDD) systems, the basesta-
tion transmitter can exploit channel reciprocity to estimate its
downlink CSI, the short coherence time in fast fading channels
would still render the CSI outdated. Thus, base stations
generally do not possess accurate instantaneous CSI. They
instead may only have statistical information of the channels.
If inaccurate CSI is used to design the transmit beamformers
without taking their CSI uncertainty into account, the users
may experience severe performance loss and QoS outage.
Recently, robust transmit beamforming designs that aim to
provide some QoS for each user under CSI errors have drawn

Fig. 1. System model.
The transmit signal at the FBS is given by
x(t) = wF · sF (t), (1)
where sF (t) ∈ C is the information-bearing signal intended
for the FUE, which is generated from a Gaussian random
codebook with zero mean, and wF ∈ CNF is the associated
beamforming vector. Let the transmit signal at the MBS be
wM · sM (t). Therefore, the received signal at the FUE can be
expressed as
y(t) = hHFFwF sF (t) + h
H
FMwMsM (t) + nF (t), (2)
where the first term is the intended signal for FUE, the second
term is the interference from macrocell, and nF (t) ∈ C is
additive noise at FUE with power σ2F > 0. The QoS of
the FUE is measured in terms of its SINR. Without loss of
generality, suppose that E[|sF (t)|2] = 1 and E[|sM (t)|2] = 1.
Then the SINR at FUE can be represented as
SINRF =
|hHFFwF |2
|hHFMwM |2 + σ2F
, (3)
and the interference power at the MUE from the femtocell can
be seen to be |hHMFwF |2.
C. Optimal Beamforming with Perfect CSI
The FBS aims to design its beamforming vector wF such
that the transmit power is minimized, subject to an SINR
constraint on the FUE and an interference power constraint
on the MUE, i.e.,
|hHFFwF |2
|hHFMwM |2 + σ2F
≥ γF and |hHMFwF |2 ≤ M , (4)
where γF ≥ 0 and M ≥ 0 are the preset target values.
Mathematically, the problem can be formulated as
min
wF∈CNF
‖wF ‖2 (5a)
s.t.
|hHFFwF |2
|hHFMwM |2 + σ2F
≥ γF , (5b)
|hHMFwF |2 ≤ M . (5c)
Although problem (5) is not convex, it can be equivalently
reformulated into a convex SOCP [6], [8], i.e.,
min
wF∈CNF
‖wF‖2 (6a)
s.t. hHFFwF ≥

(|hHFMwM |2 + σ2F ), (6b)
|hHMFwF |2 ≤ M , (6c)
Im
{
hHFFwF
}
= 0, (6d)
and thus can be efficiently solved by using interior-point based
solvers, e.g., SeDuMi [14] or CVX [15].
D. Optimal Beamforming with Imperfect CSI
Typically, femtocells are connected to macrocell network
via a wired broadband backhaul link such as digital subscriber
line (DSL) [18], and thus we assume that the beamforming
vector at the MBS, wM , is perfectly known to the FBS. In
contrast to the assumption of the perfect CSI hFF , hFM ,
and hMF made in the conventional formulation in (5), in our
work, we specifically consider two cases based on the available
channel information at the FBS:
1) No CSI feedback: The FBS has no instantaneous channel
estimate sent back from the FUE, and the FBS knows
only the statistical information of the channels:
hFF ∼ CN (0,Ch,FF ), hFM ∼ CN (0,Ch,FM ),
hMF ∼ CN (0,Ch,MF ), (7)
where channel covariance matrices Ch,FF , Ch,FM , and
Ch,MF are positive definite. This model is more advis-
able for a fast fading system [19], where the feedback
channel is unable to provide a reliable estimate of the
current CSI, and thus no instantaneous CSI estimate is
fed back to FBS.
2) Partial CSI feedback: The FBS receives estimated CSI
hFF and hFM from FUE, but knows only the statistical
information of hMF ∼ CN (0,Ch,MF ) (due to the lack
of feedback link from MUE). Specifically, the true CSIs
hFF and hFM are modeled as
hFF = hˆFF + eFF and hFM = hˆFM + eFM , (8)
where hˆFF ∈ CNF and hˆFM ∈ CNM are the channel es-
timates of hFF and hFM , respectively, and eFF ∈ CNF
and eFM ∈ CNM denote the corresponding estimation
error vectors. Assume that
eFF ∼CN (0,Ce,FF ) and eFM ∼CN (0,Ce,FM ). (9)
The model given by (8) is suitable for slow fading
channels [19].
In the presence of CSI uncertainty, the beamforming so-
lution to problem (5) will no longer guarantee the QoS
requirement in (4) universally. To mitigate this QoS outage,
our goal is to design the beamforming vector at the FBS,
wF , such that the outage occurs below a small probability
threshold. Mathematically, we come up with the following
robust beamforming design problem:

feasible if and only if
λmaxM ≥ γF

where λmax > 0 is the principal generalized eigenvalue for
the matrix pair (hFFhHFF ,hMFhHMF ).
Remark 2 Consider the case that only the statistical infor-
mation of wM (rather than the exact wM ) is known to FBS,
e.g., wM is selected from a codebook W . Let pi denote the
probability that the MUE picks the ith beamforming vector
wM,i ∈ W and feeds back its index using B bits to the MBS.
Then constraint (10b) averaged over the codebook W under
the channel model (7) can be expressed as [see (11)]

which is still a convex constraint (by the second-order con-
dition of convexity). Thus, problem (14) with constraint (14b)
replaced by (21) remains convex for this case.
IV. PARTIAL CSI FEEDBACK SCENARIO
In the previous section, we have presented the transmit
power minimization problem when the FBS has no instan-
taneous CSI feedback from the FUE, but knows the statistical
information of the channels. Obviously, when the FBS can
obtain its downlink CSI from the FUE, its transmit power
performance will be improved expectantly. In this section,
we will discuss the transmit power minimization problem
for the partial CSI feedback case that the FBS acquires
imperfect channel estimates of hFF and hFM modeled by
(8), but knows only the statistical information of hMF ∼
CN (0,Ch,MF ) (due to the lack of feedback link from MUE).
For this case, problem (10) can be written as
min
wF∈CNF
‖wF ‖2 (22a)
s.t. Prob
{ |(hˆFF +eFF )HwF |2

}
≥1−ρF ,
(22b)
Prob
{|hHMFwF |2 ≤ M} ≥ 1− ρM . (22c)
Again, problem (22) is difficult to solve since the probability
function in (22b) has no closed-form expression and may not
be convex in general.
To proceed, we first formulate constraint (22b) into a
tractable form. One can show that under (9) the random
variables
XFF =
2|(hˆFF +eFF )HwF |2
wHF Ce,FFwF
, XFM =
2|(hˆFM+eFM)HwM |2
wHMCe,FMwM (23)
are noncentral chi-squared distributed [23] with two DoF and
noncentrality parameters ζFF and ζFM , respectively, where
ζFF =

and ζFM =

However, problem (33) is still intractable since the proba-
bility function in (33b) does not have closed-form expression
in general due to indefinite W . It has been shown in [26]
that the constraint in the form (33b) can be conservatively
approximated by tractable convex constraints based on a
Bernstein-type inequality [27] as follows:
Tr (Φ(WF )) −
√
2δx− δy ≥ s(WF ), (36a)√
‖Φ(WF )‖2F + 2‖η(WF )‖2 ≤ x, (36b)
yINF+NM +Φ(WF )  0, (36c)
y ≥ 0, (36d)
where δ  − ln(ρF ). Specifically, the constraints in (36) can
be represented as in (37), shown at the top of the next page,
which is a convex constraint set with respect to (WF , x, y),
and the constant ξFM in (37b) is defined as
ξFM 

problem (22) is given by

(39) is convex, and can be efficiently solved to yield a global
optimal WF .
If the obtained solution W F is not of rank one, then
the rank-one approximation procedure [22] can be applied
to obtain a feasible (conservative) beamforming solution to
problem (22).
V. OPTIMAL TRANSMISSION STRATEGY
A. Problem Generalization
In the original beamforming problem (10), it was implicitly
assumed the transmitted signal x(t) at FBS [see (1)] has zero
mean and rank-one covariance matrix wFwHF . In spite of
low implementation complexity of the designed beamformer
at the FBS, the system performance may not be optimal in
the sense of minimum transmit power. In this section, we
consider a more general linear precoding matrix PF such
that the covariance matrix of the transmit signal x(t) is
given by QF = E[x(t)x(t)H ] = PFPHF 1. We can directly
optimize the covariance matrix QF  0 such that transmit
power Tr(QF ) is minimized while satisfying the QoS and
interference constraints. Mathematically, the problem can be
reformulated as
min
QF∈HNF
Tr(QF ) (40a)
s.t. Prob
{
hHFFQFhFF∣∣hHFMwM ∣∣2 + σ2F ≥ γF
}
≥ 1− ρF ,
(40b)
Prob
{
hHMFQFhMF ≤ M
} ≥ 1− ρM , (40c)
QF  0. (40d)
Obviously, the optimal transmission power obtained by solving
problem (40) will be lower than that obtained by solving
problem (10), due to the transmit signal has higher DoF for the
former. Similar to problem (10), problem (40) is not tractable
either because of the intricate probability functions in (40b)
and (40c).
B. Spatially i.i.d. hFF and hMF (No CSI Feedback)
Let us consider the case that the FBS knows only the
statistical information of the downlink channels and both the
channels hFF and hMF are spatially i.i.d. [see (15)], as
considered in Section III-A for beamforming design.
To solve problem (40), let us express
QF =Tr(QF )Q˜F , hFF =σh,FF ·vFF , hMF =σh,MF ·vMF
(41)
where Q˜F  0, Tr(Q˜F ) = 1; vFF ∼ CN (0, INF ); and
vMF ∼ CN (0, INF ) are power normalized counterparts of
QF , hFF , and hMF , respectively. With the expressions in
1The detailed discussion on the signal processing for generating a signal
with covariance matrix QF at the FBS can be found in [28]. This technique
can be found in several published works, e.g., [28]–[30] to improve system
performance under the single-user MISO scenario.
WANG et al.: ROBUST MISO TRANSMIT OPTIMIZATION UNDER OUTAGE-BASED QOS CONSTRAINTS IN TWO-TIER HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS 1891
for all z ≥ 0, where λi > 0, i = 1, . . . , d, and
∑d
i=1 λi = 1.
According to (47), one can easily show that the optimal
Q˜F to problem (44), or equivalently problem (43), can be
expressed by
Q˜F = U
Λ(d)(U)H , (48)
where d denotes the optimal DoF (to be presented below);
U ∈ CNF×NF can be any arbitrary unitary matrix and
Λ(d) ∈ RNF×NF is a diagonal matrix with the first d
diagonal elements being nonzero and equal to 1/d (due to
Tr(Q˜F ) = 1).
The optimal d is obtained as
d = argmin {PF (d), d = 1, . . . , NF } , (49)
where PF (d) is the power by numerically solving (45), which
can be equivalently expressed as
E

d DoF, and Γ(α, β) is lower incomplete gamma function,
defined as
Γ(α, β) =
∫ β
0
tα−1 exp (−t) dt. (51)
As a result, the optimal transmission strategy for problem (43)
can be expressed as [see (41)]
QF = PF (d
)Q˜F . (52)
On the other hand, constraint (42c) with d = d can be
represented by
Prob
{
1
2d
χ22d ≤
M
σ2h,MFPF

where F−1d (·) is the inverse function of Fd(·), and
Fd(x)  Prob
{
1
d
χ2d ≤ x
}
, (54)
which is a continuous, monotonically increasing, and invert-
ible function. Thus, as long as the condition PF (d) ≤ P¯F (d)
is satisfied, the transmission strategy in (52) is also optimal
to problem (42).
Remark 4 We should emphasize that when PF (d) >
P¯F (d
), the transmission strategy in (52) is not feasible to
problem (42) any more. For this case, one can determine the
transmission DoF by solving (50) for d = 1, . . . , NF , and
then choose the transmission DoF with the minimum power
satisfying (53). However, the obtained QF is a suboptimal
solution to problem (42) since there may exist a non-uniform
power allocation strategy such that constraint (53) is satisfied
with lower power. The optimal solution for this case is still
an open problem.
C. Feasibility Condition for Transmission Strategy (52)
Next, we present a sufficient condition under which the
transmission strategy in (52) is feasible, and thus is optimal
to the optimization problem (42). To proceed, we need the
following lemma:
Lemma 2 [31] For positive integers d ≥ 1 and  ≥ 1, let
x(d, d+) represent the point at which the CDFs Fd(x), which
is defined in (54), and Fd+(x) intersect, and
p(d, d+ ) = Fd(x(d, d + )) = Fd+(x(d, d+ )). (55)
Then p(d, d+ ) is unique, greater than 0.5, and decreases to
0.5 as d increases.
Values of p(d, d+ ) for d ≥ 1 and  ≥ 1 can be computed
numerically, and some concrete values of p(d, d+2) are listed
in Table I. By Lemma 2, the following proposition can be
proven.

solution to problem (42) if

in which p(0, 2)  1.
Proof: See Appendix C. 
VI. SIMULATION RESULTS
For ease of showing the simulation results, the proposed
transmission strategies together with the associated CSI sce-
narios and optimization problems are summarized in Table II.
The reader can refer to this table in all the simulation examples
to be presented.
We consider FBS and MBS each equipped with four
transmit antennas, i.e., NF = NM = 4. Let maximum
tolerable outage probabilities ρF = ρM = 0.1, i.e., the SINR
requirement at FUE and the interference power constraint on
MUE must be satisfied with higher than 90% probability.
Assume σ2F = 0.01 and M = −3 dB. The beamforming
vector wM at MBS is randomly generated uniformly on the
unit-norm sphere ‖wM‖2 = 1.
In the simulations, the SDR-based problems (14) and (39)
are solved using CVX [15]. For each obtained W F , we
first check whether or not it is of rank one. If yes, then
the beamforming solution wF can be simply obtained via
rank-one decomposition, i.e., W F = wF (wF )H . Otherwise,
Gaussian randomization procedure [22] is adopted to generate

h,FM = 0.01. Both the SINR outage probabilities of
“No CSI” and “No CSI (OTS)” are 10%.
where “OTS” stands for the optimal transmission strategy.
From this figure, we can also see that both methods can
achieve 90% SINR satisfaction probability. In addition, the
mean SINR value of the FUE using the optimal transmission
strategy is 19.85 dB, which is lower than the corresponding
value 25.45 dB using the optimal beamforming strategy, and
this indicates that FBS can save transmit power in achieving
the same desired SINR performance when using the optimal
transmission strategy.
Example 2: In this example, we compare the transmit
power performance of the proposed methods. All the pa-
rameter settings in generating CSI are the same as those
in Example 1. We show the results of the average transmit
power obtained by the proposed methods over 500 chan-
nel realizations. The obtained results are shown in Fig. 4.
Specifically, when FBS uses the proposed beamformer, the
performance difference in terms of transmit power between
the case that FBS knows only the statistical information of
channels (“No CSI”) and the case that FBS has partial CSI for
σ2e = 0.002 (“Partial CSI”) is around 11 dB, verifying that the
proposed beamformer is more power efficient when more CSI
information is provided. Moreover, for the scenario of no CSI
feedback, the transmit power difference between the beam-
forming strategy (“No CSI”) and the optimal transmission
strategy (“No CSI (OTS)”) is around 5.6 dB. Thus, the optimal
transmission strategy can significantly save transmit power
than the optimal beamforming strategy, illustrating a typical
performance-complexity tradeoff. In addition, for the scenario
of partial CSI, the difference between the transmit power
obtained by using the exact beamforming solution to problem
(22) (“Partial CSI”) and that obtained by using RAR approach
(“Partial CSI (RAR)”) is within 2 dB, which indicates that
the proposed RAR approach is not too conservative for this
case. This is consistent with a similar observation reported in
[26]. As a reference, we also plot the transmit power of the
“Naive CSI” method in the figure, in order to illustrate of how
much additional transmit power may be needed for the robust

methods to accommodate the outage specification. In all the
simulation instances, the solutions to the SDR-based problem,
i.e., results labeled by “Partial CSI (RAR)”, are always rank-

Other parameter settings are the same as those associated with
Fig. 4. Figure 5(a) shows the average transmit power of the
proposed methods for the spatially correlated channels. In this
figure, curves “No CSI” and “Partial CSI (RAR)” denote the
results obtained from solving problem (14) and problem (39),
respectively. We should mention that the proposed methods of
“Partial CSI” [problem (29)] and “No CSI (OTS)” [problem
(42)] are not applicable for this example (see Table II). We
also show the corresponding simulation results for  = 0.01 in
Fig. 5(b). From Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 5(b), we can observe similar
performance trends as seen in Fig. 4, while the performance
difference in terms of transmit power under no CSI feedback
scenario and under partial CSI feedback scenario will be
reduced as the channels become spatially more correlated (i.e.,
larger ). In all the simulation instances, the solutions to the
SDR-based problems are always rank-one.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
We have presented several robust transmit beamforming
designs, i.e., transmit signal with one DoF, as summarized
in Table II, for FBS equipped with NF antennas, formulated
as an outage constrained optimization problem (10), provided
that either statistical CSI, i.e., no CSI feedback from FUE,
or partial CSI is known to FBS. For the scenario of no
CSI feedback [modeled by (7)], the optimal beamformer of
problem (10) is obtained by solving (14) using off-the-shelf
convex solvers, together with the feasibility condition given
WANG et al.: ROBUST MISO TRANSMIT OPTIMIZATION UNDER OUTAGE-BASED QOS CONSTRAINTS IN TWO-TIER HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS 1895
is parameterized by Q˜F and PF .
Remark 5 We will show later in (46) that ψ(Q˜F , PF ) can be
expressed as an expectation of a cumulative distribution func-
tion (CDF) of weighted sum of exponential random variables.
The weighted sum of exponential random variables is known
as a hypoexponential random variable [33], and the CDF
is continuous and monotonically decreasing in PF . Therefore,
the function ψ(Q˜F , PF ) is monotonically decreasing, and thus
is invertible with respective to PF .
Since constraint (43b) must be active when the optimal Q˜F
and PF are achieved, constraint (43b) can be expressed
without loss of optimal solution of problem (43) as
ψ(Q˜F , PF ) = ρF . (A.8)
Therefore, the power satisfying the equality of constraint
(43b), or equivalently (A.8), can be expressed as
PF (Q˜F , ρF ) = ψ
−1(Q˜F , ρF ). (A.9)
On the other hand, let
ψ(Q˜F , PF ) = min
Q˜F0,Tr(Q˜F )=1
ψ(Q˜F , PF ), (A.10)
where Q˜F denotes an optimal solution to the minimization
problem2. It has been shown that ψ(Q˜F , PF ) is a continuous
and monotonically decreasing function of PF [31], [34], and
thus ψ(Q˜F , PF ) is invertible.
Letting P ′F be a nominal value of PF and
α = ψ−1(Q˜F , ρF )− P ′F and β = ψ−1(Q˜F , ρF )− P ′F ,
(A.11)
we have
ψ(Q˜F , P
′
F + α) = ψ(Q˜F , P
′
F + β) = ρF . (A.12)
If we can show α ≤ β, i.e., ψ−1(Q˜F , ρF ) ≤ ψ−1(Q˜F , ρF ),
by (A.9), we have PF (Q˜F , ρF ) ≤ PF (Q˜F , ρF ), which is the
desired result.
We now need to show that α ≤ β which can be proved
by contradiction. Supposing that α > β is true, due to that
ψ(Q˜F , PF ) is a decreasing function of PF and (A.12), we
have
ψ(Q˜F , P
′
F + α) < ψ(Q˜F , P
′
F + β) = ρF . (A.13)
However, according to (A.10) and (A.12), we have
ψ(Q˜F , P
′
F + α) ≥ ψ(Q˜F , P ′F + α) = ρF , (A.14)
which contradicts with (A.13), and therefore we conclude α ≤
β. The proof is thus complete. 
2Precisely speaking, the transmit covariance matrix Q˜F depends on PF
via d; see (48) and (49). However, without affecting the analysis, we will
omit the dependence between Q˜F and PF for notational brevity.

which is exactly (56). Therefore, if (A.17) holds true, problem
(A.15) is feasible by Proposition 1. If problem (A.15) is
feasible, then problem (16) is also feasible since the feasible
set of constraint (A.15c) is a subset of constraint (16c) due to
F−12θ (1−ρM ) ≥ F−12 (1−ρM ) = ln(1/ρM ) [by the definition

That is to say, problem (42) with DoF d = 1 is feasible if
problem (A.15) is feasible.
In the following, we show that the optimal transmit power
to problem (42) with DoF d = 1, denoted as PF (1) [which
is obtained by solving (50)], must be less than or equal to
P¯F (θ), i.e.,
PF (1) ≤ P¯F (θ). (A.19)
Since one can always find a feasible power to problem (A.15),
say P˜F , which is also feasible to problem (42) with DoF d = 1
[due to (A.18)], if PF (1) > P¯F (θ) holds true, then we have
P˜F ≤ P¯F (θ) < PF (1), which is a contradiction to that PF (1)
is the optimal (minimum) power to problem (42) with DoF
d = 1.
Since PF (1) ≥ PF (d) [by (49)] and P¯F (θ) ≤ P¯F (d) [by
(A.15c) and (A.16)], according to (A.19), we have PF (d) ≤

unchanged over a relatively long period of time and thus the
amount of feedback information can be significantly reduced.
With CDI at the transmitters, the ergodic rate region of the
-user MISO IFC has been analyzed and the structure of the
Pareto optimal beamformers has been characterized in [20]. For
a two-user case, an efficient algorithm for finding the Pareto
boundary of the ergodic rate region was presented in [21].
Unlike the ergodic achievable rate where the packet delay is
not taken into consideration, the outage constrained achievable
rate is more suitable for delay-sensitive applications, such
as those involving voice or video data communications. For
such outage constrained achievable rate region, the authors of
[22], [23] presented a numerical method for finding the Pareto
boundary; however, the complexity of this algorithm increases
exponentially with the number of transmitter-receiver pairs.
Developing efficient beamforming design algorithms that can
approach the outage constrained Pareto boundary is therefore
important. While several efficient beamforming algorithms can
be found in [24], [25], a different power-minimization design
criterion was considered, instead of rate utility maximization.
In this paper, we investigate efficient coordinated beam-
forming design algorithms for maximizing the system utility
under rate outage constraints and individual power constraints.
Specifically, we assume that the MISO channel between each
transmitter and receiver is composed of zero-mean circularly
symmetric complex Gaussian fading coefficients where the
corresponding covariance matrix is known to the transmitter.
We formulate an outage constrained coordinated beamforming
design problem, aiming at finding the Pareto optimal beam-
formers that maximize the system utility (e.g., the weighted
sum rate) subject to a pre-assigned rate outage probability
requirement and power constraints. Due to the complicated
nonconvex outage constraints, we propose a successive convex
approximation (SCA) algorithm, where the original problem
is successively approximated by a convex problem and the
beamforming solution is refined in an iterative manner. The
convex approximation formulation is obtained by applying the
convex optimization based semidefinite relaxation (SDR) tech-
nique [26], followed by a logarithmic change of variables and
first-order approximation techniques. We analytically show that
the proposed SCA algorithm can yield a beamforming solution
that is a stationary point for the SDR of the original problem.
We further propose a round-robin-fashioned (block-coordinate)
distributed SCA algorithm where each transmitter optimizes
only its beamformer using local CDI with limited communica-
tion overhead of message exchange with the other transmitters.
It is shown by simulations that the two proposed algorithms
yield near-optimal performance with lower complexity com-
pared with those reported in [22], [23].
The remaining part of this paper is organized as follows. The
system model and the outage constrained coordinated beam-
forming problem are presented in Section II. In Section III, we
present the proposed SCA algorithm and analyze its conver-
gence property. In Section IV, the distributed SCA algorithm is
developed and analyzed. Simulation results that demonstrate the
efficacy of the proposed algorithms are presented in Section V.
Finally, the conclusions are drawn in Section VI.

II. SIGNAL MODEL AND PROBLEM STATEMENT
We consider the -user MISO IFC where each transmitter
is equipped with antennas and each receiver with a single
antenna. It is assumed that transmitters employ transmit beam-
forming to communicate with their respective receivers. Let
denote the information signal sent from transmitter , and
let be the corresponding beamforming vector. The
received signal at receiver is given by
(1)
where denotes the channel vector from transmitter
to receiver , and is the additive white
Gaussian noise at receiver where is the noise variance.
As can be seen from (1), in addition to the noise, each receiver
suffers from the cross-link interference . We
assume that all receivers employ single-user detection where the
cross-link interference is simply treated as background noise.
Under Gaussian signaling, i.e., , the instan-
taneous achievable rate of the th transmitter-receiver pair is
known to be
In this paper, we assume that the channel coefficients
are block-faded (i.e., quasi-static), and that the transmitters
have only the statistical information of the channels, i.e., the
CDI. In particular, it is assumed that for
all , where denotes the channel
covariance matrix and is known to all the transmitters. Since
the transmission rate cannot be adapted without CSI, the
communication would be in outage whenever the transmission
rate is higher than the instantaneous capacity that the
channel can support. For a given outage probability require-
ment , the beamforming vectors must satisfy
. Following [23], we define
the corresponding -outage achievable rate region as follows.
Definition 1 [23]: Let denote the power constraint of
transmitter , for . The rate tuple
is said to be achievable if ,
, for some
where is the maximum tolerable outage probability

To illustrate this restrictive approximation, let us consider the
following change of variables:
(7)
for , where are slack variables. By
substituting (7) into (6), one can reformulate problem (6) as the
following problem
(8a)
(8b)
(8c)
(8d)
(8e)
(8f)
where , and the set is defined in
(9) below. Notice that we have replaced the equalities in (7)
with inequalities as in (8c) to (8f). It can be verified by the
monotonicity of the objective function that all the inequalities
in (8b) to (8f) would hold with equalities at the optimal points.
We also note that, for example, if the optimal solution satis-
fies in (8d), then the optimal has to be
minus infinity which is not attainable. Similar issues also occur
in and . In view of this, in (8) we have enforced
to lie in the subset
(9)
where . As long as is set to a small number, the rate loss
due to (9) would be negligible.
It is interesting to see that constraint (8b) is now convex;
constraints (8d) and (8f) are also convex. Constraints
(8c) and (8e) are not convex; nevertheless, they are rela-
tively easy to handle compared with the original (6b). Let
be a feasible point of
problem (8). Define
(10)
for . Then, , , together with
and , , are feasible to problem (8).
Here we conservatively approximate (8c) and (8e) at the point
. Since both of and are
convex, their first-order lower bounds at and are respec-
tively given by
(11)
Consequently, restrictive approximations for (8c) and (8e) are
given by
(12a)
(12b)
By replacing (8c) and (8e) with (12a) and (12b), we obtain the
following approximation of problem (5):
(13a)
(13b)
(13c)
(13d)
(13e)
(13f)
Problem (13) is a convex optimization problem; it can be effi-
ciently solved by standard convex solvers such as [30].
Let and denote the optimal
beamforming matrices and achievable rates yielded by the
approximation problem (13). Since the lower bounds in (11)
may not be exactly tight, it may hold, for and
and for some that
(14)
i.e., the rate outage probability is strictly less than and thus
the outage constraint is over satisfied. Alternatively, one can
obtain a tight rate tuple , where for all
, by solving the equations
(15)
for . Note that each equation in (15) can
be efficiently solved by simple line search. The obtained
and then serve as an approxi-
mate solution for problem (6).
In summary, the reformulation above consists of two approx-
imation steps: a) the rank relaxation of to by
SDR, and b) constraint restrictions of (8c) and (8e) by (13c)
and (13e). Note that if problem (13) yields a rank-one optimal
, a rank-one beamforming solution can be
readily obtained by rank-one decomposition of
for all . It is then straightforward to verify by
the restrictiveness of (13c) and (13e) that this rank-one beam-
forming solution is also feasible to the original
problem (5) [i.e., problem (2)], thereby satisfying the desired
rate outage requirement. In view of this, it is important to
investigate the conditions under which problem (13) can yield
rank-one optimal . The following proposition
provides one such condition:
Proposition 1: Assume that (13) is feasible. Then there ex-
ists an optimal satisfying ,
provided that the number of users is no larger than
three, i.e., .
Proof: Let denote an op-
timal solution of problem (13). Consider

Theorem 1: Suppose that the utility is
differentiable and strictly increasing with respect to , for
. Then, the sequence,
generated by Algorithm 1, converges, and any limit point of
the sequence
is a stationary point of problem (8) as well as a stationary
point of problem (6) with extra constraints for
(see (9)).
Proof: As discussed earlier, the utility
is nondecreasing with . Moreover, due to the individual power
constraints, the sequence
is bounded, which implies the convergence of
.
Let ,
denote the optimal solution of (20). To prove that any limit point
of is a stationary point of (8), two key observations are
needed. Firstly, we note that the proposed SCA algorithm is in
fact an inner approximation algorithm in the nonconvex opti-
mization literature [32]. In particular, the nonconvex constraints
in (8c) and (8e), i.e.,
are respectively replaced by
(23)
(24)
for all , . One can verify that
and satisfy
(25)
(26)
(27)
(28)
(29)
(30)
for all and .
Secondly, the restrictive approximations made in (20c) and
(20e) are asymptotically tight as as stated in the fol-
lowing claim:
Claim 1: It holds true that
(31)
(32)
for all , .
Claim 1 is proved in Appendix A. Moreover, by the mono-
tonicity of and due to (9), it is not difficult to
verify that:
Claim 2: The sequence generated by Algorithm 1
is bounded.
Now let us consider the KKT conditions of (20). Denote
as the La-
grangian of (20). For ease of explanation, let
denote the constraint function in (20b), and consider the fol-
lowing Lagrangian-stationarity condition:
(33)
where
are dual variables associated with
constraints (20b)–(20f), the transmit power constraint and
. Since problem (20) satisfies the Slater’s
condition, the dual variables are bounded [33]. Moreover,
is bounded as well by Claim 2. Therefore, there exists a subse-
quence and a primal-dual
limit point, denoted by
and
such that
(34)
where is primal-dual feasible to (20). Consider (33)
over the subsequence . By taking in
(33), and by (27), (31) and (34), we obtain
which is the Lagrangian-stationarity condition of (8) corre-
sponding to . By applying similar arguments above to all
the other KKT conditions of (20) and by Claims 1 and 2, we
1094 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING, VOL. 61, NO. 5, MARCH 1, 2013
for It is worth mentioning that problem (36)
is only solved once and successive approximation is not per-
formed as in Algorithm 1. As long as problem (36) is solved by
transmitter , the algorithm directly goes to the next optimiza-
tion problem performed by transmitter . Successive ap-
proximation is now performed implicitly from one transmitter
to another in a round-robin fashion.We summarize the proposed
distributed SCA algorithm in Algorithm 2.
Algorithm 2: Distributed SCA algorithm for solving problem
(2)
1: Given an initial beamforming matrix at transmitter
, for .
2: For all , transmitter computes by
(37), and pass them to the other transmitters.
3: Set
4: repeat

7: User solves (39) to obtain and
compute , followed by solving (36)
to obtain the solution

8: User computes by (37) and passes them
to all the other transmitters.
9: end for
10: until the predefined stopping criterion is met.
11: For , each transmitter decomposes
, if is of rank one; otherwise perform
Gaussian randomization to obtain a rank-one approximate
solution.
Analogous to Algorithm 1, we can show that Algorithm 2
generates a stationary point of problem (8) as stated in the fol-
lowing theorem.
Theorem 2: Suppose that is differentiable
and is strictly increasing with respect to , for .
Then, the sequence gener-
ated by Algorithm 2 converges to a common value for all
. Moreover, for all , any limit point of the se-
quence is a
stationary point of problem (8) as well as a stationary point of
problem (6) (with the extra constraints in (9)).
Different from the proof for Theorem 1, the proof for The-
orem 2 is more involved, since the beamforming vectors of
transmitters are not simultaneously optimized as in Algorithm
1 but are individually optimized in a round-robin manner. The
detailed proof of Theorem 2 is presented in Appendix B.
Remark 1: An important issue concerning distributed opti-
mization algorithms is the communication overhead introduced
by message exchange between transmitters. To address this,
we compare the communication overhead of the proposed
Algorithm 2 with the following two schemes. Scheme 1: All
the transmitters directly exchange their CDI so that the design
problem (2) can be handled independently by each transmitter.
Scheme 2: A control center gathers the CDI from all transmit-
ters, optimizes the beamforming vectors, and distributes the
beamforming solutions to the transmitters. We consider a cel-
lular system where all the transmitters (i.e., BSs) are connected
by dedicated backhaul links (e.g., optical fibers) and the BSs
exchange messages in a point-to-point fashion. Since, in Algo-
rithm 2, transmitter needs to inform ( real values)
to all the other transmitters in each round, the communi-
cation overhead due to transmitter is quantified by the amount
of real values. Hence, the total communication over-
head of Algorithm 2 is
real values, where is the number of rounds run by Algorithm
2. For scheme 1, each transmitter needs to send covariance
matrices (which contain real values) to all the other
transmitters. Therefore, the associated total communication
overhead is given by
real values. Therefore, for scheme 1, if , then the
proposed Algorithm 2 has a smaller amount of communication
overhead. For scheme 2, there are covariance matrices sent
from the transmitters to the control center, and the optimal
solution passed from the control center to transmitter
for , respectively. Hence, the communication
overhead is real values. Therefore, for
scheme 2, the proposed Algorithm 2 has a smaller amount of
communication overhead if . As we
show in the simulation section, Algorithm 2 in general can
converge in less than 15 rounds for a system with and
.
Remark 2: It should be noticed that, while in general Algo-
rithm 2 is more efficient in terms of computation and communi-
cation overhead, it may result in larger transmission delays and
thus reduced throughput (due to the round-robin optimization
in Algorithm 2) compared to the centralized schemes. Nonethe-
less, since the proposed beamforming design is based on the
users’ statistical channel information, which usually changes
much more slowly compared to the instantaneous CSI, beam-
forming optimization needs not be performed frequently. As
a result, the induced throughput loss should not be a serious
concern.
V. SIMULATION RESULTS
In the section, we demonstrate the performance of the pro-
posed Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 for solving the outage con-
strained coordinated beamforming problem in (2). In the simu-
lations, we consider , , and for the objective
function , corresponding to maximization of
the weighted sum rate, the weighted geometric mean rate, and
the weighted harmonic mean rate, respectively. All receivers are
assumed to have the same noise power, i.e.,
, and all power constraints are set to one, i.e.,
. The parameter in (9) is set to . The channel co-
variance matrices are randomly generated. We normalize
the maximum eigenvalue of , i.e., , to one for all
, and normalize to a value for all ,
. The parameter , thereby, represents the relative
cross-link interference level. If not mentioned specifically, all
are of full rank, and the outage probability requirements
are set to the same value, i.e., , indicating
a 10% outage probability. The stopping criterion of Algorithm
1 is

the exhaustive search method in [22]. One can see from this
figure that, for all rate utility functions, the proposed SCA algo-
rithm first approaches the Pareto boundary and then converges
to the corresponding optimal rate tuple along the boundary. In
Fig. 2(b), we display similar results with an asymmetric user pri-
ority, i.e., . It can be observed that the SCA
algorithm still converges to the optimal rate tuples in a similar
fashion.
Example 2: To further demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed SCA algorithm, we evaluate the performance of the
SCA algorithm for the case of in this example.
(Since under this setting, the exhaustive search method in [22]
is too complex to implement, and, to the best of our knowl-
edge, there is no existing method for comparison, we can only
compare the proposed SCA algorithm with the heuristic MRT
and ZF schemes.) Fig. 3(a) shows the simulation results of the
average achievable sum rate versus . From this figure, one
can observe that the proposed SCA algorithm yields better sum
rate performance than the MRT scheme, especially when
. For , the two methods exhibit comparable per-
formance. In Fig. 3(b), we have shown the simulation results
for , and for all . Under
this setting, the ZF scheme is feasible and its average sum rate
performance is also shown in Fig. 3(b). It can be observed from
this figure that the ZF scheme outperforms the MRT scheme for
high or when the cross-link interference is strong .
Nevertheless, as can be seen from Fig. 3(b), the proposed SCA
algorithm still outperforms both the MRT and the ZF schemes.
Fig. 4 demonstrates the simulation results for the weighted
geometric mean rate and the weighted harmonic mean
rate, for and for an asymmetric weighting
. Performance comparison
results similar to those in Fig. 3 can also be observed in this
figure. In addition, it is interesting to note from Fig. 4 that, in
contrast to the sum rate performance as shown in Fig. 3, the
weighted geometric mean rates and weighted harmonic mean
rates achieved by the proposed SCA algorithm in Fig. 4(a) and
Fig. 4(b) saturate for high . These phenomena might result
from the fact that user fairness plays a more prominent role
in the geometric mean rate and the harmonic mean rate; and

Combining the above observations, i.e., (A.2), (A.3) and
, and by the monotonicity of the exponential
function, we obtain that , which implies
(A.4)
Suppose that does not converge to zero for
some and . Then there exists an such that,

(A.1) to (A.4), we must have and thus

(22), implies that the utility diverges as
goes to infinity however. Therefore, we must have

Now we use (A.5) to prove (31). It follows from (A.2) and (A.5)
that

pansion [34] of at , i.e.,

gives rise to
Since both and are bounded by Claim 2, we con-
clude that (31) is true.
To show (32), we note from (A.1), (A.4) and (A.6) that
(A.8)
Analogously, by considering the 2nd-order Taylor series expan-
sion of at , i.e.,
where for all , and substituting it into (A.8),
we obtain
Again, since and are bounded by Claim 2, we obtain
(32).
APPENDIX B
PROOF OF THEOREM 2
Define for all
. Then it can be shown that
is a feasible point of (36). Hence,
for all . In addition, analogous to (15), we have
for all , and thus
for all , which implies that the sequence
is nondecreasing. Since it
is also bounded, , ,
converge as .
Now let us look at the KKT conditions of problem (36). Re-
call the definitions of and in (23) and (24) and their
inner approximation properties in (25) to (30). Let
(A.9)
(A.10)
Moreover, let
be the optimal solution of (36), and let
where , , , ,
, , denote the dual vari-
ables associated with constraints in (36b) to (36g), and
, , denote the dual variables associated with
constraint and , respectively.
Let be the Lagrangian function. The KKT
conditions of (36) are given by (A.11) and (A.12) shown on the
the next page. Note that we have omitted the complementary
slackness conditions for constraints (36b)–(36g) since they are
trivially satisfied at .
To show the desired results, we also need the following two
claims:
1100 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING, VOL. 61, NO. 5, MARCH 1, 2013
Claim 3: It holds true that
(A.13a)
(A.13b)
(A.13c)
(A.13d)
(A.13e)
(A.13f)
Claim 4: For each , generated by Algorithm 2 is
bounded for all .
The proof of Claim 3 is presented in Appendix C. Similar
to Claim 1, (A.13a) to (A.13d) imply that the restrictive ap-
proximations in (36e) and (36f) are asymptotically tight as
. Since problem (36) satisfies the Slater’s condition,
the dual variable vector is bounded [33]. Moreover,
is also bounded by Claim 4. Now let us consider the
primal-dual solution pair for all .
Since they are all bounded, there exists a subsequence
and limit points
and
for all , such that
(A.14)
for . By (A.13e) and (A.13f), we see that both
and converge to the same limit point, and
they are the same for all , i.e.,
(A.15)
Analogously, by (A.13a) to (A.13d), we have that
(A.16)
(A.17)
Then, it follows from the inner approximation properties in
(25) to (30), (A.13a), (A.13c), and (A.14) to (A.17) that the KKT
conditions in (A.11) and (A.12) converge along the subsequence
to
(A.18a)
(A.18b)
(A.18c)
(A.18d)
(A.18e)

Distributed Robust Multicell Coordinated
Beamforming With Imperfect CSI:
An ADMM Approach
Chao Shen, Tsung-Hui Chang, Member, IEEE, Kun-Yu Wang, Zhengding Qiu, and
Chong-Yung Chi, Senior Member, IEEE
Abstract—Multicell coordinated beamforming (MCBF), where
multiple base stations (BSs) collaborate with each other in the
beamforming design for mitigating the intercell interference
(ICI), has been a subject drawing great attention recently. Most
MCBF designs assume perfect channel state information (CSI) of
mobile stations (MSs); however CSI errors are inevitable at the
BSs in practice. Assuming elliptically bounded CSI errors, this
paper studies the robust MCBF design problem that minimizes
the weighted sum power of BSs subject to worst-case signal-to-in-
terference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints on the MSs. Our
goal is to devise a distributed optimization method to obtain
the worst-case robust beamforming solutions in a decentralized
fashion with only local CSI used at each BS and limited backhaul
information exchange between BSs. However, the considered
problem is difficult to handle even in the centralized form. We first
propose an efficient approximation method for solving the non-
convex centralized problem, using semidefinite relaxation (SDR),
an approximation technique based on convex optimization. Then
a distributed robust MCBF algorithm is further proposed, using
a distributed convex optimization technique known as alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We analytically show the
convergence of the proposed distributed robust MCBF algorithm
to the optimal centralized solution. We also extend the worst-case
robust beamforming design as well as its decentralized implemen-
tation method to a fully coordinated scenario. Simulation results
are presented to examine the effectiveness of the proposed SDR
method and the distributed robust MCBF algorithm.

I. INTRODUCTION
R ECENTLY, multicell coordinated signal processing hasdrawn great attention because it can provide signifi-
cant system throughput gains compared to the conventional
single-cell designs [2], [3]. We consider the scenario where the
base stations (BSs) are equipped with multiple antennas and
the mobile stations (MSs) are equipped with single antenna.
The BSs in different cells employ multicell coordinated beam-
forming (MCBF) [2], aiming at jointly designing the beam
patterns of each BS in order to effectively mitigate the intercell
interference (ICI). To this end, various MCBF designs have
been proposed [4]–[8]. Most of the MCBF designs assume that
the BSs are connected with a control center which knows all
the MSs’ channel state information (CSI) and computes the
beamforming solution in a centralized manner. In practical
multicell systems, however, obtaining the MCBF solutions in
a decentralized fashion using only local CSI at each BS is of
central importance, thereby having drawn extensive studies
on distributed beamforming [6]–[13]. The reasons are that
1) the future wireless systems prefer a flat Internet Protocol
(IP) architecture where all BSs are directly connected with the
core network [14]; 2) if the control center is still employed,
a distributed optimization method can be used to decouple
the original problem into multiple parallel subproblems with
smaller problem size, thus reducing the required computation
power of the control center [15]. One of the most popular
beamforming design criteria is to minimize the transmit power
of BSs subject to quality-of-service (QoS) constraints of MSs
[4]–[6], [16]. In [6], by leveraging the uplink-downlink duality
[4], a distributed optimization method was proposed for the
power-minimization-based MCBF design problem. Distributed
optimization methods based on primal and dual decomposition
techniques [17] were, respectively, reported in [13] and [10] for
fully exploiting the inherently block-separable structure of the
MCBF problem. Game theory-based distributed optimization
methods were also proposed in [9] recently. Though being
suboptimal in general, game theoretic approaches demand a
much smaller amount of information exchange among BSs.
In [12], the idea of uplink-downlink duality was used for dis-
tributed optimization of a different max-min-fair MCBF design
problem [18].

each communicates with its associated MSs using transmit
beamforming. The scenario under consideration is that each
MS is served by only one BS; extension to the scenario where
one MS is served by multiple BSs will be given in Section V.
We use to denote the th BS, and the th MS
in the th cell, for all and
. Let be the signal of interest for
, and be the associated beamforming vector.
The transmit signal by is given by
(1)
for . The received signal of can be expressed as
(2)
where denotes the channel vector from to
, and is the additive noise of , which
is assumed to have zero mean and variance . The
term may capture both the receiver noise and the in-
terference from the noncoordinated BSs. In (2), the first term
is the signal of interest for , and the second and third
terms are the intracell interference and ICI, respectively. As-
sume that are statistically independent, with zero mean
and for all and , and that each
MS employs single-user detection. By (2), the SINR of
is given by
(3)
Single-cell beamforming designs [16], [29], [35] are devel-
oped mainly for handling the intracell interference. To effec-
tively mitigate the ICI, the following MCBF design has been
considered [36]
(4a)
(4b)
where is the power priority weight for . As seen,
the MCBF design jointly optimizes the beamforming vectors
of all the BSs such that the weighted sum power is minimized,
and meanwhile the MSs’ SINR requirements must
be fulfilled. It has been shown that (4) can be reformulated as
a convex second-order cone program (SOCP) [36], which can
be efficiently solved via standard convex solvers, e.g., SeDuMi
[37].
B. Worst-Case Robust MCBF Design
The MCBF design in (4) assumes that the BSs have perfect
knowledge of the CSIs. As discussed in the introduction sec-
tion, in practice, the BSs inevitably suffer from CSI errors. Let
, , be the preassumed CSI at the
BSs. Then the true CSI can be expressed as
(5)
where denotes the CSI error vector satisfying the
following elliptic model:
(6)
where , specifies the size and shape
of the ellipsoid. When where , (6)
reduces to the popular spherical error model
[20]. The following simulation example motivates the need of
robust designs for accounting for the CSI errors.
Example: Let us consider a two-cell system , with
two MSs in each cell . Each of the BSs is equipped
with four antennas . A set of preassumed CSI
is randomly generated following the independent and iden-
tically distributed (i.i.d.) complex Gaussian distribution with
zero mean and unit variance (see Section VI-A for the detailed
channel model used in the simulation). Using the preassumed
CSI, an optimal beamforming solution is obtained by solving
the MCBF problem (4) for for , 2. To
examine the impact of the CSI errors, we generated 10 000 sets
of CSI errors satisfying , for
all , , , and evaluated the achievable
SINR values in (3). Fig. 1 displays the probability distribution
of the achievable SINR values of . As seen, it is with very
high chance that the achieved SINR is smaller than the target
value, due to the CSI errors. The worst SINR value can be even
less than 5 dB.
To guarantee that the SINR requirement can be satisfied
for all possible CSI errors, we consider the following worst-case
robust MCBF design [1], [26]:
(7a)
(7b)
In comparison to the nonrobust design in (4), the above worst-
case robust MCBF design can provide guaranteed QoS for the
MSs, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Solving the robust design problem
(7), however, is more challenging because, firstly, each of the
SINR constraints is nonconvex, and second, there are infinitely
many such nonconvex SINR constraints (due to the worst-case
design criterion). In the next section, we propose to apply the
2992 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING, VOL. 60, NO. 6, JUNE 2012
2) There exists a such that
By applying S-lemma, we can recast (13) and (14) as the fol-
lowing linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) (15)–(16), shown at the
bottom of the page, where , and
are slack variables. Consequently, one can reformu-
late (9) as the following:
(17a)
(17b)
(17c)
(17d)
Problem (17) is a convex SDP which can be efficiently solved
by off-the-shelf convex solvers [37].
B. Optimality Conditions
An important aspect of SDR is whether the optimal solution
satisfies for some ,
for all . If this is true, then is an optimal solution of
the original robustMCBF problem (7). It, therefore, is important
to investigate the conditions under which the SDR problem (17)
can yield rank-one . Some provable conditions are given
in the following proposition.
Proposition 1: Suppose that the SDR problem (17) is fea-
sible. Consider the following three conditions:
C1) , i.e., there is only one MS in each cell;
C2) for all , i.e., for all , i.e.,
perfect intracell CSI ;
C3) For the spherical model, i.e., for all
, the CSI error bounds satisfy
for all , where are some CSI error bounds under
which (17) is feasible, with denoting the associated
optimal objective value.
If any one of the above three conditions is satisfied, then the SDR
problem (17) must yield a rank-one solution, that is,
must satisfy for all .
Proof: The proofs of C1) and C2) are presented in
Appendix A. Case C3) is a generalization of the result in
[38] where the tightness of SDR for the worst-case robust
beamforming problem in the single-cell scenario is
studied. Case C3) can be proved following exactly the same
idea as in [38] and thus the details are omitted here.
Case C1) of Proposition 1 shows that the global optimum of
the robust MCBF problem (7) can be attained by solving the
SDR problem (17) whenever . While this result is in-
teresting from the theoretical point of view, we should mention
that, when , (7) can also be optimally solved by em-
ploying an SOCP reformulation idea presented in [26], [39]. It
is known that solving an SOCP is in general computationally
cheaper than solving an SDP [e.g., (17)]. For the general case
of , Case C2) shows that if the BSs have channel uncer-
tainty only for intercell CSI, i.e., where , and
perfectly know the intracell CSI, i.e., , then rank-one
solutions are guaranteed. If errors occur in both intracell and in-
tercell CSI, Case C3) implies that rank-one solutions can also
be obtained as long as that the CSI errors are sufficiently small.
For a general setup, it is not known yet whether the SDR
problem (17) has a rank-one solution. If the obtained solution
is not of rank one, then additional solution approximation
procedure, such as the Gaussian randomization method [28],
can be employed to obtain a rank-one approximate solution
to (7). Quite surprisingly, we found in our simulation tests
that (17) with spherical CSI errors always yields rank-one
. Hence for these problem instances, we can simply
perform rank-one decomposition of .
Investigating the reasons behind would be an interesting future
research; see [38] and [40] for recent endeavors.
IV. DISTRIBUTED ROBUST MCBF ALGORITHM USING ADMM
Solving the SDR problem (17) calls for a control center
which requires all the CSI of MSs. As discussed in the Intro-
duction, it is desirable to obtain the beamforming solutions in a
decentralized fashion using local CSI at each BS, i.e., uses
only for all . A simple approach would be
applying the dual decomposition method [17], similar to the
approach in [10] and [26]. However, as will be explained later,
the dual decomposition method is not suitable for (17) due to
the fact that the decomposed problems lack strict convexity
(15)
(16)
2994 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING, VOL. 60, NO. 6, JUNE 2012
(26b)
where collects all the ICI variables, and collects variables
and (where ) that are only relevant
to . It is not difficult to check that there exists a linear map-
ping matrix , such that
for all . By (25), (26), and , we can rewrite
(24) in a compact form as
(27a)
(27b)
(27c)
Note that in (26a) and (27), the elements of are relaxed to the
real space rather than explicitly required to be nonnegative so as
to simplify the later optimization steps of ADMM. It will be seen
that ADMM will converge asymptotically with a nonnegative
iterate in the sequel due to the constraints (26b) and (27c).
Before applying ADMM, let us first see why the conventional
dual decomposition method [17] is not suitable for (27). Con-
sider the dual problem of (27)
(28)
where , , are the dual variables associated
with (27c). While the inner minimization problem of (28) is
obviously decomposable, given , it is possible to
obtain an inner solution of such that , i.e.,
the inner minimization problem is unbounded below, due to the
unbounded feasible sets [see (25), (15), and (16)]. In fact, by
our numerical experience, this undesired situation happens very
often, especially when .
To overcome this issue, we apply the augmented Lagrangian
method to (27) according to the principle of ADMM; this leads
to the following problem:
(29a)
(29b)
(29c)
(29d)
where , , are slack variables, which are
introduced in order to impose the penalty term
. Problem (29) is equivalent to (27), but the added penalty
terms can resolve the numerically unbounded below issue; see
[31].
Now we are ready to apply ADMM. Consider the following
correspondences between (29) and (20):
(30)
where and , ,
, are the dual variables associated with con-
straints (29c) and (29d), respectively. According to Algorithm
1, the corresponding ADMM step 4 for (29) is to solve the
following:
(31)
As one can see, (31) can be decomposed as the following
subproblems:
(32)
for . Since (32) is convex, it can be efficiently
solved.
Second, the corresponding ADMM step 5 is given by solving
the following two problems:
(33)
(34)
Because both (33) and (34) are convex quadratic problems,
they have closed-form solutions given by
(35a)
(35b)
2996 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING, VOL. 60, NO. 6, JUNE 2012
and is the beamforming vector of for sending
. The received signals of intracell and cell-edge
are, respectively, given by
(39)
(40)
for , , and , where
is the channel vector from to cell-edge , and
is the additive noise at cell-edge , which is assumed to
have zero mean and variance . Note from (39) and
(40) that we have taken into account the inevitable time delays
between the BSs and MSs [8], [43]. Assume
that for all , and that each is tem-
porally uncorrelated with zero mean and unit variance. The re-
ceiver SINRs corresponding to (39) and (40) are given by (41)
and (42) [8], shown at the bottom of the page.
Our goal here is, again, to find the beamforming vectors that
are robust against the possible CSI errors. As the channel error
model for intracell MSs, we model the cell-edge MSs’ channel
as , , where
is the preassumed CSI, and is the CSI error satis-
fying in which . We consider the
following worst-case robust formulation:
(43a)
(43b)
(43c)
The proposed method based on SDR and S-lemma in
Section III-A can be used to handle (43) as well. First, re-
place each and each by general-rank
and , respectively. Second, follow the steps in (8)–(16)
to decouple and transform the constraints in (43b) and (43c)
into a finite number of LMIs. The resulting SDR problem can
be shown to be

timum of (43) if the CSI errors are sufficiently small. A dis-
tributed optimization algorithm for (44) can also be developed

SDR method consumes around 24 dBm while the method in
[26] requires 29 dBm. On the other hand, it is noticeable from
Fig. 3(b) that the average powers of all methods decrease with
, which seems counter-intuitive. The reason for this is that the
set and the total number of feasible channel realizations used
for evaluating the average powers significantly vary with , and
thus the obtained average powers turn out not necessarily to in-
crease with .
C. Performance of Proposed Distributed Robust MCBF
Algorithm
Now, let us examine the performance of the proposed dis-
tributed robust MCBF algorithm (Algorithm 2). In the simu-
lations, the initial input values
are all set to zero. The augmented penalty parameter is not a
constant, but given by
if
otherwise, (47)
where . As one can verify that will reach the
value of one after nine iterations, Algorithm 2 following (47)
will still converge to the global optimum for a sufficiently large
, according to Proposition 2. First, we compare the optimal
sum power of the centralized problem (7) with that obtained
by Algorithm 2. The simulation results by testing over 50 ran-
domly generated channel realizations are presented in Fig. 4,
under various simulation settings. From Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(b),
where and and , respectively, we can ob-
serve that Algorithm 2 can yield near-optimal solutions within
50 iterations. As observed, for most of the cases, 10 and 20 it-
erations are quite sufficient for the scenarios in Fig. 4(a) and
Fig. 4(b), respectively. When the number of cells increases
to three , as shown in Fig. 4(c), 25 iterations are suf-
ficient to obtain a near-optimal solution. General speaking, as
the number of cells and that of MSs increase, the number of it-
erations needed to achieve a near-optimal performance also in-
creases. As seen from Fig. 4(d), where , at least 100
iterations are required.
To further look into the convergence behavior of Algorithm
2, we show in Fig. 5(a) the typical convergence curves of Algo-
rithm 2 in the scenarios considered in Fig. 4(a) to Fig. 4(c). In
Fig. 5, the normalized power accuracy is defined as
(48)
where is the sum power at iteration ,
and denotes the centralized solution of (17). We can see
from Fig. 5(a) that Algorithm 2 can yield a solution with the
normalized power accuracy smaller than 0.1 within 50 itera-
tions. Fig. 5(b) shows the convergence curves of Algorithm 2
for , , , and various CSI error radii
and SINR requirements. It can be seen from this figure that the
convergence speed can be slowed down as the CSI error radius
or SINR requirement increases. Nevertheless, for the scenarios
considered in Fig. 5(b), less than 40 iterations are needed for
achieving 0.01 normalized power accuracy. The simulation re-
sults shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 well demonstrate the conver-
gence of Algorithm 2, as stated in Proposition 2.
D. Performance of Robust Fully Coordinated BF
In this subsection, we examine the effectiveness of the robust
fully coordinated BF design (43) in serving the cell-edge MSs.
To this end, let us consider a three-cell system with
twoMSs in each cell . As illustrated in Fig. 6, we divide
each cell into two parts, namely, the intracell region (circular
disks) and the cell-edge region. In particular, the inter-BS dis-
tance is set to 500 meters and the radius for the intracell region
is 235 meters. In each cell, the position of one of the MSs is ran-
domly generated within the intracell region; while the other MS
is randomly located in the cell-edge region within the equilat-
eral triangle formed by the three BSs (see Fig. 6). As the robust
fully coordinated BF design (43) is applied, the three MSs in
the cell-edge regions will be served simultaneously by the three
BSs, i.e., and in (43); while when the robust
MCBF design (7) is applied, each BS will serve the two MSs
located inside its cell region (the hexagon), i.e., in (7).
Fig. 7 shows the performance comparison results of the robust

BF design (43).
errors are sufficiently small, the proposed SDR method can
yield the global optimal solution to the original problem, i.e.,
(7) (Proposition 1). Moreover, by using ADMM, we have
presented a distributed robust MCBF algorithm (Algorithm 2).
The proposed distributed algorithm is appealing because it is
proven to converge to the global optimum of the centralized
problem (Proposition 2). Extension of the proposed SDR
method to the fully coordinated scenario has been presented
as well. The presented simulation results have shown that the
proposed SDR method is more power efficient than the existing
method reported in [26], and that the proposed distributed
optimization algorithm can obtain beamforming solutions with
the normalized power accuracy smaller than 0.1 in several tens
of iterations for the typical scenario of . As a future
research, it is also possible to apply other variations of ADMM
to distributed MCBF design for faster convergence and smaller
backhaul signaling overhead.
APPENDIX A
PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1
Proof of Case C1): Let us rewrite (17) for as follows:
(A.1a)
(A.1b)
(A.1c)
(A.1d)
(A.1e)
where the subindices and in (17) have been removed for no-
tational simplicity. Proposition 1 can be proved by investigating
the KKT conditions of (A.1). Specifically, let ,
and be the optimal dual variables asso-
ciated with (A.1b), (A.1c), and (A.1d), respectively. Moreover,
let
(A.2)
According to the KKT conditions of (A.1), one can verify
that the optimal , , satisfy the following
conditions:
(A.3)
(A.4)
(A.5)
(A.6)
(A.7)
(A.8)
for . Specifically, to show (A.8), we note that if ,
then it follows from (15) that:
(A.9)
which contradicts with (A.1b).
The first step of the proof is to show that has rank one
whenever has rank one. Suppose that is of rank one
and that where . Let
. Then by (A.4)
(A.10)
It follows from (A.3) and (A.10) that must be of rank one
due to
(A.11)
What remains is to show that is indeed of rank one. First,
one can show that since, if not, by (A.2), (A.6), and the
fact of , we must have , which, however,
leads to by (A.4) and thus by (A.11), and
consequently contradicts with (A.3). By substituting (A.2) into
(A.5), where is given by (15), it is not difficult to verify that
the following two equalities hold:
(A.12)
(A.13)
By postmultiplying (A.13) with , and adding the resultant
equality to (A.12), one can obtain
(A.14)

One should note that for updating (35a), each in fact
does not need to compute the whole ; instead, only
needs , which is composed of and
. Similarly, to compute (36a), each also
only needs . The interesting part is that, by exploiting
the structure of , one can show that can actually learn
and by communicating only
with . Specifically, one can show that (35a) has an explicit
structure of
(B.5a)
(B.5b)
for all . From (B.5), we can see that only needs
to send the real values of and
to . In summary, each BS to-
tally needs to send out real values in each itera-
tion, which is more backhaul efficient than Algorithm 2
real values as stated in Remark 2) when .

Power Allocation and Time-Domain Artificial Noise
Design for Wiretap OFDM with Discrete Inputs

Abstract—Optimal power allocation for orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) wiretap channels with Gaussian
channel inputs has already been studied in some previous works
from an information theoretical viewpoint. However, these results
are not sufficient for practical system designs. One reason is
that discrete channel inputs, such as quadrature amplitude
modulation (QAM) signals, instead of Gaussian channel inputs,
are deployed in current practical wireless systems to maintain
moderate peak transmission power and receiver complexity. In
this paper, we investigate the power allocation and artificial
noise design for OFDM wiretap channels with discrete channel
inputs. We first prove that the secrecy rate function for discrete
channel inputs is nonconcave with respect to the transmission
power. To resolve the corresponding nonconvex secrecy rate
maximization problem, we develop a low-complexity power
allocation algorithm, which yields a duality gap diminishing in
the order of O(1/
√
N), where N is the number of subcarriers
of OFDM. We then show that independent frequency-domain
artificial noise cannot improve the secrecy rate of single-antenna
wiretap channels. Towards this end, we propose a novel time-
domain artificial noise design which exploits temporal degrees of
freedom provided by the cyclic prefix of OFDM systems to jam
the eavesdropper and boost the secrecy rate even with a single
antenna at the transmitter. Numerical results are provided to
illustrate the performance of the proposed design schemes.

wireless services. Traditionally, wireless information security
is handled by cryptographic protocols in media access control
(MAC) and higher layers [1]. However, these techniques face
severe challenges due to the rapid developments of encryption
breaking algorithms and super-computers [2]. Recently, vari-
ous physical-layer techniques have been proposed to realize
perfect secrecy in wireless networks [3], [4].
The fundamentals of physical-layer security techniques
were laid in [5]–[7]. These works studied the maximum data
rate for secrecy communications, i.e., the secrecy capacity, for
a wiretap channel in which an eavesdropper (Eve) intends to
wiretap the secrecy communications from a transmitter (Alice)
to a legitimate receiver (Bob). Recently, various techniques,
such as power allocation, beamforming and training schemes,
have been developed to maximize the secrecy capacity of
wiretap channels, e.g., [8]–[20]. One effective technique is
initiatively transmitting artificial noise to jam the eavesdropper
if the transmitter is equipped with multiple antennas, e.g.,
[15]–[19]. Besides, advanced techniques based on secrecy-
key agreement were also studied in [21]–[25] to improve the
security of wireless networks.
A common assumption of these studies is that the trans-
mitted signal has a Gaussian distribution. However, Gaussian
signals are hardly used in practice due to its infinite peak
power and its excessive detection complexities. Instead, dis-
crete inputs such as Phase Shift Keying (PSK) and Quadrature
Amplitude Modulation (QAM) (see Fig. 1(a)) are prevalent
in practical digital communication systems [26]. Furthermore,
most existing artificial noise designs rely heavily on the spatial
degrees of freedom provided by multiple transmit antennas,
which are not available in single-antenna wiretap channels.
In this paper, we consider an OFDM wiretap channel with
discrete channel inputs, where each node is equipped with a
single antenna and Alice has perfect knowledge of the channel
state information (CSI) for the wireless links to Bob and Eve.
We intend to answer the following questions: What are the
differences between the secrecy rate functions corresponding
to Gaussian and discrete channel inputs? Do these differences
introduce additional difficulty in solving the power allocation
problem of the OFDM wiretap channel with discrete channel
inputs? Can we make use of artificial noise to improve the
secrecy rate of an OFDM wiretap channel when the transmitter
is equipped with only one antenna? To address these questions,
we first study the convexity of the secrecy rate function with
discrete channel inputs, and then develop power allocation and
time-domain artificial noise designs to maximize the secrecy
rate of OFDM wiretap channels. The main contributions of
this paper are summarized as follows:

B. Discrete Channel Inputs
In [28], [30]–[33], it was observed from computer sim-
ulations that the secrecy rate Rs(p) in (4) is nonconcave
in p for some discrete constellations, such as QPSK and
16QAM. One can infer from Theorem 1 in [32] that Rs(p) is
nonconcave for any uniformly distributed discrete inputs. We
now prove that Rs(p) is nonconcave for any discrete channel
input distribution with a finite number of possible values:
Proposition 1 Consider the following secrecy rate function:
R(p)  [I(s;H√ps+ w)− I(s;G√ps+ v)]+, (6)
where s has zero mean and unity variance, and w and v are
circularly symmetric complex Gaussian random variables with
zero mean and unity variance. Suppose that s has a finite
entropy, i.e., H(s) < ∞. Then, if |H | > |G|, R(p) ≥ 0 and
R(p) is nonconcave in p; otherwise, R(p) = 0 for all p ≥ 0.
Proof: We first show that R(0) = limp→∞ R(p) = 0.
When p = 0, one can easily show that I(s;w) = I(s; v) =
0, because s is statistically independent of w and v. Thus,
R(0) = 0. Since s has a finite entropy, it must be a discrete
random variable. According to Lemma 6 of [34], we have
lim
p→∞ I(s;H
√
ps+w) = lim
p→∞ I(s;G
√
ps+ v) = H(s) < ∞.
(7)
Therefore,
lim
p→∞R(p) = 0. (8)
Next, let us show that, when |H | > |G|, there exists a pˆ ∈
(0,∞) such that R(pˆ) > 0. According to [34], the gradient of
I(s;H√ps+ w) is given by
∂I(s;H√ps+ w)
∂p
= |H |2mmse (|H |2p) ≥ 0, (9)
where
mmse(|H |2p)  E [|s− E(s|H√ps+ w)|2] (10)
is the minimum mean square error (MMSE) of estimating s
with the received signal y = H√ps + w. When p equals
zero, mmse(|H |2p) in (10) attains its maximum value, i.e.,
mmse(0) = E[|s|2] = 1. Thus, by (6) and (9), it can be seen
that R′(0) = |H |2 − |G|2 > 0, which implies that there must
exist a positive pˆ such that R(pˆ) > 0.
Since R(p) is continuous and differentiable [34], by the
Lagrange’s mean value theorem [35] and the fact that R(pˆ) >
limp→∞R(p) = 0, it can be inferred that there must exist a
point p˜ ∈ [pˆ,∞) satisfying R(p˜) < ∞ and R′(p˜) < 0.
Now suppose that R(p) is a concave function on p ∈ [0,∞).
Then the following inequality
R(p) ≤ R(p˜) +R′(p˜)(p− p˜) (11)
must hold for any p ∈ [0,∞). By letting p → ∞ in (11),
we obtain limp→∞ R(p) = −∞ since R′(p˜) < 0, which
however contradicts the fact of limp→∞ R(p) = 0. Therefore,
the concavity assumption for R(p) is not true.
When |H | ≤ |G|, I(s;H√ps+ w) ≤ I(s;G√ps + v) for
any p ≥ 0. Hence, in this case, R(p) = 0 for all p ≥ 0.
Proposition 1 is thus proved.
Proposition 1 implies that finding an optimal power allo-
cation for maximizing Rs(p) is a non-trivial design problem,
as will be discussed shortly. By Proposition 1, the secrecy
rate function is not a concave function for any channel input
distribution with a finite entropy. Basically two types of inputs
have finite entropy, including discrete distributions with a finite
number of distinct values and some of the discrete distributions
with a countable number of distinct values1. On the other
hand, distributions with an infinite entropy basically include all
continuous distributions and some of the discrete distributions
with a countable number of values, and this type of channel
inputs may have a concave secrecy rate function.
1A discrete distribution with a countable number of values may either have
a finite entropy or an infinite entropy [36, page 48].

The Lagrange dual method first solves problem (15) for a

is a one-dimensional power allocation subproblem for subcar-
rier i, which can be efficiently solved by simple line search
[37].
Notice that d(λ) is a convex function [37] and its subgra-
dient can be easily seen, from (16) and (17), to be
d(λ) = P − 1

N∑

pi ,
where pi is the optimal solution to (17). Therefore, the dual
variable λ can be efficiently updated using the bisection
method [37]. If P − 1N
∑N
i=1 p

i > 0, then the subgradient
d(λ) > 0, and thus we decrease λ in the bisection method
for finding D given by (14); otherwise we increase λ. The
resulting power allocation algorithm, called Algorithm 1, for
finding the desired p for problem (3) is summarized in
Table I. It is important to note from (8) that the secrecy rate
is not an increasing function of the transmit power. Therefore,
when the total power P is large enough, the optimal total
transmit power 1N
∑N
i=1 p

i by solving (17) can be strictly
lower than the available transmit power P , and the optimal
dual variable is λ = 0 by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
conditions [37]. It is worthwhile to mention that Algorithm 1
can also be applied to the case of Gaussian inputs, where the
per-subcarrier power allocation subproblem (17) has a closed-
form solution exactly the same as (5) [8]–[10].
Since the primal problem (3) is nonconvex, there is a
duality gap between the optimal R and optimal D, i.e.,
D − R > 0, where R and D are defined in (3) and
(14), respectively. Under a Lipschitz continuity assumption
on the channel coefficients [38], it can be shown that the
duality gap between D and R diminishes with N in the
order of O(1/
√
N). Prior to presenting such result, some
quantities used in the discrete frequency domain and the
corresponding quantities in the continuous frequency domain
need to be reviewed. Let H(f) and G(f) denote the frequency
domain channel responses of the legitimate receiver and the
eavesdropper, respectively. Owing to uniform sampling in Dis-
crete Fourier transform (DFT) over the normalized frequency
interval 0 ≤ f ≤ 1, we have
H(i/N) = Hi, G(i/N) = Gi, 1 ≤ i ≤ N. (18)
In general, the time-domain channel has a finite delay
spread (i.e., it is nonzero only on a finite time interval), leading
to the fact that any order derivatives of its frequency response
exist and are bounded [39, pp. 94-96]. In particular, the first
derivatives of H(f) and G(f) exist and are bounded. There-
fore, there exist some LH , LG > 0 such that the following
Lipschitz continuous conditions hold for all f, f ′ ∈ [0, 1]:∣∣H(f)−H(f ′)∣∣≤LH|f−f ′|, ∣∣G(f)−G(f ′)∣∣≤LG|f − f ′| (19)
We can show the following proposition:
Proposition 2 Suppose that the channel coefficients H(f)
and G(f) are Lipschitz continuous satisfying (19). Then
0 ≤ D −R ≤ O
(
1√
N
)
, (20)
where R and D are defined in problem (3) and problem
(14), respectively.
Proof: In accordance with [38, Theorem 2], for proving
(20) it is sufficient to show that there exists a constant LR > 0
such that the difference between the secrecy rates on any two
frequencies, Rs(f, p) and Rs(f ′, p′), is bounded, i.e.,
|Rs(f, p)−Rs(f ′, p′)| ≤ LR (|f − f ′|+ |p− p′|) , (21)
for any f, f ′ ∈ [0, 1] and p, p′ ≥ 0, namely, that the secrecy
rate Rs(f, p) is Lipschitz continuous. The proof of (21) is
presented in Appendix I.
B. Numerical Results
We now provide some numerical results to illustrate the
efficacy of the proposed power allocation scheme (Algorithm
1 in Table I). Suppose that the OFDM system has N = 64
subcarriers. The length of the cyclic prefix (CP) is Ncp = 16
channel samples. Each channel realization is composed of 8
i.i.d. Rayleigh fading paths with the maximum time delay of
7 samples and the channel power normalized to unity. The
numerical results are obtained by averaging over 300 channel
realizations for each signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) value, where
SNR = P (which is the ratio of the available transmit power
to AWGN power (E[|wi|2] = E[|vi|2] = 1) per subcarrier).
The proposed power allocation algorithm is compared with
two existing algorithms. The first one is the equal power
allocation scheme, denoted by “equal PA”, which allocates
the total power uniformly over all the subcarriers that satisfy
|Hi| > |Gi|; the second one is the power allocation scheme
for Gaussian channel inputs, which is given by (5), denoted
by “PA of (5)”.
Figure 4 illustrates the achievable secrecy rates of the three
power allocation schemes for different channel inputs. It can
be observed from this figure that Algorithm 1 (denoted by
“+”) achieves the highest secrecy rate (although it yields the
same optimal solution (5) for Gaussian channel inputs). One

The optimal solution for artificial noise power parameters of
(24) is given in the following proposition.
Proposition 3 For any given distribution of {si}, the optimal
artificial noise power σ2a,i to problem (24) is equal to zero for
all i.
For the case that {si} are Gaussian, Proposition 3 can be
simply proved by showing that, when |Hi|2 > |Gi|2, the
secrecy rate RANs is strictly decreasing in σ2a,i for any pi ≥ 0.
The proof for the case of arbitrarily distributed {si} is
more complicated, because RANs may be non-monotonic in
σ2a,i. The proof details for general distributions of {si} are
presented in Appendix II.
Proposition 3 implies that adding artificial noise in the
frequency domain is not effective since it only degrades the
achievable secrecy rate. Next let us turn to the design of
artificial noise in the time domain which is able to boost the
secrecy rate.
B. Proposed Time-domain Artificial Noise Design
The proposed wiretap OFDM system with a time-domain
artificial noise is illustrated in Fig. 6(b). As a standard OFDM
system, at first the frequency domain signal P1/2s is trans-
formed to the time domain by inverse fast Fourier transform
(IFFT) and then the cyclic prefix (CP) is inserted. Then,
an artificial noise term is added to this time-domain signal
before transmission. The receiver will discard the CP and then
transform the remaining signal to the frequency domain by
FFT. All of these operations can be expressed by linear matrix
operations [40].
Let F and FH denote the N ×N FFT and IFFT matrices,
and let Ncp denote the length of CP. The matrices for CP in-
sertion and removal are represented by Tcp = [E˜TNcp×N IN ]
T
and Rcp = [0N×Ncp IN ], respectively, where E˜Ncp×N con-
tains the last Ncp rows of the N ×N identity matrix IN . Let
[h(0), h(1), ..., h(L)] and [g(0), g(1), ..., g(L)] represent the
time-domain channel impulse responses from the transmitter
to the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper, respectively,
where L < Ncp is the maximum delay spread. Then, following
the system block diagram in Fig. 6(b), the received signals of
the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper can be expressed
as [40]
y = FRcpH0(T
cpFHP1/2s+ a) +w
= HP1/2s+ FRcpH0a+w,
(25a)
z = FRcpG0(T
cpFHP1/2s+ a) + v
= GP1/2s+ FRcpG0a+ v,
(25b)
where a ∈ CN+Ncp is a zero-mean complex Gaussian random
vector, H0 ∈ C(N+Ncp)×(N+Ncp) is a Toeplitz channel matrix
given by
H0 =
⎡

and so is the matrix G0, i.e., by replacing h(l) with g(l), l =
0, 1, ..., L, in H0. Moreover, in (25), H = FRcpH0TcpFH =
Diag(H1, H2, ..., HN ) and G = FRcpG0TcpFH =
Diag(G1, G2, ..., GN ), in which Hi and Gi are the frequency
responses of the legitimate receiver’s channel and the eaves-
dropper’s channel, respectively, and w ∼ CN (0, IN ) and
v ∼ CN (0, IN ) are the corresponding noise vectors at the
legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper, respectively.

ting all the constant terms, problem (40) can be equivalently
formulated as

(41)

the following problem:

N∑

s.t. ti ≥ (bHi Σdbi + 1)−1, i = 1, 2, ..., N. (42)
Finally, by applying Shur complement [37], problem (42) can
be recast as
min
Σd0,{ti}Ni=1
N∑
i=1
|Gi|2pi
[

s.t.

 0, i = 1, 2, ..., N.
(43)
Problem (43) is a standard SDP, which can be solved by
convex solvers such as CVX [44] or SeDuMi [45].
We now show the convergence of the proposed successive
convex approximation algorithm. The first-order convex ap-
proximation of the function Ti(ti), i.e., T˜i(ti) in (39), satisfies
the following three relations:
• T˜i(ti) ≥ Ti(ti), ∀ti, since Ti(ti) is concave with respec-
tive to ti [43];
• T˜i(t¯i) = Ti(t¯i);
• T˜ ′i (t¯i) = T
′
i (t¯i).
Hence, according to [46], the proposed successive convex ap-
proximation algorithm will converge to a point satisfying KKT
conditions of the original problem (36), thereby leading to a
stationary local maximum of problem (36). This successive
convex approximation method for solving problem (36), called
SCA algorithm, is summarized in Table II, and the artificial
noise aided power allocation algorithm, called Algorithm 2,
for solving (31) is summarized in Table III.

E. Numerical Results
We now show some numerical results to compare the
performance of the proposed artificial noise aided power
allocation algorithms (Algorithm 2 in Table III for discrete
inputs and Algorithm 3 in Table III for Gaussian inputs)
with the power allocation algorithm without using artificial
noise (Algorithm 1 in Table I) and the classical/mercury
water-filling strategy with no eavesdropper (Eve) [47]. The
OFDM system with N = 64 subcarriers and CP length
Ncp = 16 samples is considered. The channel coefficients
{Hi} and {Gi} are generated by following the same procedure
in Section III-B. The numerical results are averaged over
300 channel realizations with different values of SNR = P

loss of generality3.
We use contradiction to prove the result. Suppose that
σ2a,i > 0 (56)
for some i. Then it is necessary that pi > 0; otherwise we
end up with (55) again, and thus σ2a,i = 0 is also a feasible

true and σ2a,i = 0 for all i. By this, the asserted statement is
proved.

systems, one may exploit the available spatial DoF to degrade
eavesdroppers’ effective channels substantially. The MIMO se-
crecy capacity problems are considered in [18]–[21]; see also
[22] for fast fading channels. Many present works, such as the
aforementioned, focus on information theoretic aspects. Never-
theless, very recently there has been growing interest from the
signal processing side in the designs and optimization of secret
transmit schemes; see, e.g., [23]–[27].
In addition to using the transmit DoF to weaken eavesdrop-
pers’ receptions, another meaningful idea in physical-layer se-
crecy is that of artificial noise (AN) [24], [25], [28]. In AN-aided
methods, a fraction of the transmit power is allocated to send ar-
tificially generated noise signals, usually in form of an almost1
isotropically distributed spatial noise process, to interfere the
eavesdroppers. Presently, the AN-aided methods are considered
mostly for the case of passive eavesdroppers where no eaves-
droppers’ CSI is known to the transmitter, which is important es-
pecially to military applications. In principle, one may also con-
sider utilizing the eavesdroppers’ CSI (assuming active eaves-
droppers) to steer the AN towards eavesdropper’s directions for
more effective blocking, rather than keeping the AN isotropic.
The idea of making AN spatially focused is very recently con-
sidered in some concurrent studies; e.g., interference alignment
in [25], and cooperative jamming in [23].
In this paper, we establish secret transmit beamforming
designs using a QoS-based perspective. Specifically, the QoS
refers to the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR). The
proposed designs assume CSI on the legitimate receiver and
eavesdroppers, either in form of the instantaneous channel re-
alization or the channel correlation matrix. Moreover, spatially
focused AN is employed. In the proposed designs we degrade
eavesdroppers’ interceptions by constraining their maximum
allowable SINRs, while, at the same time, we enhance the
legitimate receiver’s SINR either by constraining its minimum
SINR requirement or by maximizing its SINR. It is interesting
to point out that without AN, the design formulations de-
scribed above are very similar to those for the cognitive radio
(CR) application [15], [26], [29], [30]. Essentially, avoiding
eavesdroppers from overhearing in physical-layer secrecy is
reminiscent of protecting primary users from being interfered
in CRs. However, this relationship does not hold when the
former employs AN, which is the case in this work (primary
users in CR may not be interfered, unlike eavesdroppers).
The proposed secret transmit designs advocate joint optimiza-
tion of the transmit weights and AN spatial distribution. How-
ever, the resultant designs are difficult problems in a worst-case
sense. We show that the proposed design problems are NP-hard
in general. While this is the case, we also show that our design
problems can be exactly solved for a class of practically rep-
resentative problem instances. We consider semidefinite relax-
ation (SDR), a convex-optimization-based approximation tech-
nique that has been proven to be a powerful tool for handling a
wide variety of signal processing problems [8], [31], [32]. Our
analysis reveals that SDR can lead to exact (or globally optimal)
solutions to the proposed design problems for some instances;
e.g., when the legitimate receiver’s CSI is known, or when the
spatial covariances of the legitimate receiver’s and eavesdrop-

onal complement subspace of the legitimate receiver’s channel. Physically it
means that the AN does not interfere the legitimate receiver.
pers’ CSIs are white. Moreover, two extensions, namely, those
for colluding eavesdroppers and multiple legitimate receivers,
are examined.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II provides the
problem formulation. The optimization aspects of the formu-
lated designs are addressed in Sections III and IV, respectively.

plex scenarios. Simulation results and conclusions are given in
Sections VI and VII, respectively.

II. PROBLEM FORMULATION
In this section, we describe the system model and formulate
the proposed secret transmit beamforming designs.
A. Signal Model
Our scenario of interest is that of one single-antenna legiti-
mate receiver overheard by multiple single-antenna eavesdrop-
pers. A simple diagram is depicted in Fig. 1 to illustrate the sce-
nario. For convenience, we will refer to the transmitter, the legit-
imate receiver, and the eavesdroppers as Alice, Bob, and Eves,
respectively. Alice is equipped with transmit antennas, using
transmit beamforming to send information to a single-antenna
Bob; the transmission is overheard by single-antenna Eves.
At this moment we assume that Eves do not collude. By letting
be the transmit signal vector of Alice, the received
signals at Bob and Eves are, respectively, modeled as
(1)
(2)
where is the channel from Alice to Bob,
is the channel from Alice to the Eve, and and
are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) complex cir-
cular Gaussian noises with variances and ,
respectively.
This paper considers AN-aided transmit beamforming. In
such a scheme, the transmit vector takes the structure
(3)
Here, is the data stream intended for Bob only, where
we assume without loss of generality;
LIAO et al.: QOS-BASED TRANSMIT BEAMFORMING 1205
(9). We therefore have shown that (8) is always feasible under
the assumption in Lemma 1.
The second design formulation is as follows.
Formulation 2 (maximizing Bob’s SINR subject to con-
straints on power and Eves’ SINRs): Given a maximum al-
lowable SINR threshold on Eves and a transmit power
limit , design by solving
(11)
The design criterion of Formulation 2 is to offer the best pos-
sible SINR on Bob, given a power specification and an
SINR limit on Eves . Problem (11) always has a feasible solu-
tion. However, in some instances; e.g., demanding specifications
and/or having many Eves, it is possible that the best SINR on
Bob found by (11) be lower than . Under such circumstances,
the system operator should consider relaxing the power specifi-
cation such that a reasonable SINR on Bob is attained.
The goal of this paper lies in finding the optimal transmit
design solutions of the above two design formulations. This will
be addressed in the following two sections.
III. OPTIMIZATION IN THE POWER MINIMIZATION DESIGN
This section considers the optimization aspects of the power
minimization design for AN-aided transmit beamforming. The
first subsection studies the nature and challenge of the problem,
while the second subsection describes the proposed approach to
handling the problem.
A. The Problem Nature
Let us explicitly express the power minimization design (8)
as
(12a)
(12b)
(12c)
(12d)
It is interesting to note that (12) is related to a CR transmit
design problem [15], [30], when we remove all the AN terms in
(12) to form the following no-AN design:
(13a)
(13b)
(13c)
In particular, from a CR perspective, (13c) represents interfer-
ence temperature constraints for keeping interference to the pri-
mary users below a tolerable level. The no-AN design (13) is
generally nonconvex, but can be turned to a convex problem for
the case of (i.e., instantaneous CSI on Bob). In
that case, (13) can be reformulated as a second order cone pro-
gram [1], [3], [5]. However, one may verify that the same convex
reformulation trick does not work for the AN-aided design (12).
The AN-aided design (12) is a nonconvex quadratic opti-
mization problem, only because of Bob’s nonconvex SINR con-
straint in (12b). Unfortunately, the fact that only one constraint
in (12) is nonconvex leads to the claim that (12) is a very diffi-
cult problem in general.
Lemma 2: Both (12) and (13) are NP-hard in general.
The proof of Lemma 2 is shown in Appendix A. We should
mention that the NP-hardness claim in Lemma 2 is based on
the argument that for a general class of problem instances
, , there exist problem
instances where (12) can become very hard to solve. While this
means that we may not be able to find an optimization algorithm
that can solve (12) efficiently for all problem instances, it might
be possible that (12) can be handled quite well for most of the
problem instances that are of practical interest. This motivates
our endeavor to use SDR to handle (12), the development of
which is presented in the next subsection.
B. Semidefinite Relaxation, and Its Optimality Conditions
To describe the application of SDR to the AN-aided design
(12), let us define and rewrite (12) as
(14a)
(14b)
(14c)
(14d)
where the constraints , in (14d) are
equivalent to constraining . In the SDR approach,
we relax (14) by neglecting the constraint in
(14d)
(15a)
(15b)
(15c)
(15d)
The relaxed problem above, which we will call the SDR
problem of the original design problem (12), is convex—it is
a semidefinite program whose optimal solution can be effi-
ciently obtained by available interior-point algorithms; e.g., the
off-the-shelf solvers SeDuMi [33] and CVX [34].
LIAO et al.: QOS-BASED TRANSMIT BEAMFORMING 1207
Proposition 2: The quasi-convex SDR problem in (17) is
equivalent to the SDP in (20). The equivalence lies in that if
is optimal to (20), then is op-
timal to (17).
The above described equivalent SDP reformulation of the
SDR problem not only provides a computationally more effi-
cient way of solving SDR (compared to the bisection search), it
also sheds light into conditions under which SDR exactly solves
the SINR maximization design. By examining the equivalent
SDR problem (20), we show in Appendix D that
Proposition 3: Consider the AN-aided SINR maximiza-
tion design (16), and its SDR problem (17). Suppose that
satisfy either one of the following
conditions:
C1) (Instantaneous CSI on Bob) , while
for any scaling , for all .
C2) (Correlation-based CSI on Bob and Eves, with white
channel covariance) , and the channel correla-
tion matrices take the form
where , and
are such that .
C3) (The number of Eves is no greater than two) ,
and are arbitrary.
There exists an optimal SDR solution, denoted by , for
which is of rank one. Moreover, for Cases C1) and C2), any
optimal SDR solution must have rank-one .
Interestingly, the cases for which SDR is identified to give
exactly optimal solutions to the SINR maximization design, as
shown above, are almost the same as those for the power mini-
mization design (see Proposition 1).
V. EXTENSIONS
We herein describe two possible extensions of the above
described AN-aided secret transmit beamforming designs,
namely, to the colluding-Eve scenario and the multigroup
multicast scenario. They are, respectively, considered in the
following two subsections.
A. Colluding Eves
We consider a scenario where some Eves cooperate to form
joint receive beamforming, in an attempt to improve their
interception. For ease of exposition of the ideas, we assume that
all Eves are colluding. Moreover, Eves are assumed to perform
joint maximum SINR receive beamforming. Following the
model in (1) and (2), the maximum receive SINR achieved by
colluding Eves is defined to be
(21)
where denotes the receive beamformer weight of Eves,
, and . It is
shown that the SINR in (21) can be reduced to
(22)
where , and is a
linear matrix function whose entry is
(23)
with for the correlation-based CSI case;
and for the instantaneous CSI case.
Our idea is to bound below a known threshold
by bounding the per-Eve SINRs . We found by
analysis that bounding the per-Eve SINRs may not be enough
to bound the colluding-Eve SINR, but there is a simple remedy
as described in the following proposition.
Proposition 4: Consider a variation of Formulations 1 and 2,
where we add the following convex constraint on their respective
design problems in (8) and (11):
(24)
For such modified design problems, it holds true that any fea-
sible satisfies
(25)
The proof of Proposition 4 is described in Appendix E.
Proposition 4 indicates that by adding the constraint (24) in
the designs, the maximum allowable colluding-Eve SINR is
constrained below indirectly. We should emphasize that
the SDRs of the resultant modified designs are simply those of
the original [(15) and (20)] with the addition of the constraint
(24). Those modified SDRs are again convex SDPs, and it can
be verified that the SDR rank-one optimality for Cases C1) and
C2) in Propositions 1 and 3 still holds for the modified SDRs.
B. Multigroup Multicast
In multigroup multicast, we consider a general multi-Bob set-
ting described as follows. Alice is intended to transmit multiple
data streams to multiple groups of Bobs. The transmit signal
vector at Alice becomes
(26)
where is the number of data streams, is the data
stream which is assumed to be independent of one another,
is the transmit weight vector corresponding to , and
is again the AN. There are Bobs to be served, and the
received signal of each Bob is modeled as
(27)
LIAO et al.: QOS-BASED TRANSMIT BEAMFORMING 1209
ii) Correlation-based CSI Case: In this case, the channels of
Bob and Eves are assumed to be random with correlation
matrices given, respectively, by
(33)
(34)
where describes the level of channel uncer-
tainty ( means instantaneous CSI, means no
knowledge of the channel directions at all). The channel
means are isotropically distributed on a
unit sphere. Specifically, for , we generate in each sim-
ulation trial a random vector , and then
set . The same generation procedure applies
to each .
The following settings are assumed for all the following sim-
ulation examples, unless specified: Bob’s noise power is
0 dB. All Eves have identical noise powers, and we denote
. The number of trials for Monte Carlo
simulations is 1000. All the optimization problems involved in
the proposed designs were solved by SeDuMi [33].
A. Example 1: Power Minimization Design, Instantaneous
CSI Case
This example demonstrates the performance of the proposed
AN-aided design under the power minimization formulation in
Formulation 1. The instantaneous CSI case is assumed. The
chosen design is solved by SDR; cf., Proposition 1, Case C1).
We also consider two other designs in our simulations, namely,
the no-AN design in (13), and the isotropic AN design in (9) and
(10). These two designs are based on the power minimization
formulation, with some restrictions on the transmit structures.
The other simulation settings are , , 0 dB,
10 dB.
The simulation results are shown in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2(a), the
average transmit powers of the various designs are plotted over
a wide range of values of . Note that large physi-
cally means strong (clean) overhearing ability for Eves, while
small means weak (noisy) overhearing ability. We ob-
serve that for 10 dB, the powers used in all the de-
signs are quite similar. This is because the designs do not need
TABLE I
GAUSSIAN RANDOMIZATION PROCEDURE FOR THE MAX-
MIN-FAIR PROBLEM (30)
to spend much resource to deal with weak Eves. However, for
0 dB, there are significant performance differences.
The proposed AN-aided design generally yields the smallest
powers among the three designs, and its performance gaps rel-
ative to the other two designs are wider as increases. For
example, at 20 dB, the performance gap between the
proposed and no-AN designs is 12 dB in power, while that be-
tween the proposed and isotropic AN designs is 4 dB. Fig. 2(a)
also reveals that for the strong Eves regime (say, 0 dB),
using AN, even in an isotropic manner, would give better per-
formance than not using AN.
To get more insights, in Fig. 2(b) we separately plot the
transmit powers of the transmit weight vector and AN. It can
be seen that the power allocated to AN increases with .
This further confirms that using AN is the reason behind the
good power saving performance of the proposed AN design.
The figure also shows that the power allocated to AN in the
proposed design is less than that in the isotropic AN design.
We are also interested in seeing how the transmit powers of
the various designs change with the number of Eves. The sim-
ulation settings are the same as the previous, except that we
modify 20 and we fix 15 dB. The results are

empirical observation suggests that SDR may be more powerful
in practice than what the presently available analysis outlines.
C. Example 3: Colluding Eves, Power Minimization Design,
Instantaneous CSI Case
This example considers the colluding-Eve scenario. The
simulation settings are the same as those in Example 1. We
should reiterate that the proposed design incorporates the indi-
rect method in Proposition 4 for bounding the colluding-Eve
SINR. As for the no-AN and isotropic AN designs, their simple
transmit structures enable them to deal with the colluding-Eve
SINR [cf., (22)] directly. In the simulation, the maximum
allowable colluding-Eve SINR threshold is set to 5 dB.
The simulation results are shown in Fig. 4. We see that the
proposed design exhibits marginal performance loss compared
to the no-AN design for 10 dB 5 dB, but
the proposed design outperform the other two designs for
0 dB.
D. Example 4: Multigroup Multicast, Max-Min-Fair Design,
Instantaneous CSI Case
This last example demonstrates the viability of the proposed
design in the multigroup multicast scenario. We consider a two-
group multicast transmission, where there are four Bobs and
two Bobs form one group (thereby , ,
). There are four Eves . The number
of transmit antennas at Alice is . The instantaneous
CSI case is assumed. The max-min-fair design formulation and
the subsequent SDR approximation described in Section V-B is
used to provide the AN-aided and no-AN designs. The transmit
power limit is 25 dB. The number of randomizations in
the SDR approximation is . The respective simulation re-
sults are shown in Fig. 5(a), where we plot the worst-Bob SINR
with respect to . It is observed that for the specification
0 dB, the SINR gaps between the no-AN and AN-aided
designs are small and do not exceed 1.1 dB. Our speculation
for such a marginal performance difference is that the no-AN
design can wisely exploit interferences between transmit beams
LIAO et al.: QOS-BASED TRANSMIT BEAMFORMING 1213
We see that for , (A3b) and (A3c) are satisfied simul-
taneously only when . With , the constraints in
(A3b) and (A3c) are the same as . Hence, (A3) is
equivalent to the NP-hard problem in (A1). This completes the
proof of the NP-hardness of (12).
Moreover, (13) can be shown to be NP-hard by following the
same proof as above.
B. Proof of Proposition 1
The proof of Proposition 1 for the three cases is as follows.
Case C1: The idea of the proof is that the KKT conditions
of the SDR problem (15) automatically restrict its optimal solu-
tion to have rank-one . Let be an optimal
dual variable for the constraint (15b), ,
be those for the constraints (15c), and be that for the
constraint . We consider only the KKT equations rele-
vant to , given as follows:
(A4a)
(A4b)
(A4c)
Equation (A4b) implies that the columns of must lie in the
nullspace of . Therefore, we get
(A5)
We will show that the occurrence of C1) implies that
, and, subsequently, .
Since is not a feasible point due to (15b), the re-
maining possibility is that .
Under Case C1), the KKT equation (A4a) can be expressed
as
(A6)
(A7)
Since and for all , the matrix
in (A7) is positive definite. Thus, its square root factor
is invertible. Using this result, we can rewrite (A6) as
(A8)
From (A8) and by basic matrix analysis concepts, one can show
that
(A9)
and that
due to the underlying matrix structure. As a result, we have
under Case C1).
Case C2: The proof is similar to that of Case C1), where
the key is to prove that . Under Case C2),
the dual variable in (A4a) is expressed as
(A10)
(A11)
(A12)
Let us assume , in which case in (A11) is positive
definite. Following the same derivations as in C1), one can show
that . On the other hand, assume that .
Let us construct a vector
where , ,
is the orthogonal complement projector of
(here the superscript denotes the pseudo inverse). Since
, we have . Moreover, satis-
fies for all , and . Now, let
us inspect the quadratic form
(A13)
Since implies by (A12), we have .
This further implies that is not PSD, which in turn violates
the KKT condition in (A4a). Hence, we conclude that

Training Sequence Design for Discriminatory
Channel Estimation in Wireless MIMO Systems
Tsung-Hui Chang, Member, IEEE, Wei-Cheng Chiang, Y.-W. Peter Hong, Member, IEEE, and
Chong-Yung Chi, Senior Member, IEEE
Abstract—This paper proposes a training-based channel es-
timation scheme for achieving quality-of-service discrimination
between legitimate and unauthorized receivers in wireless mul-
tiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. The proposed
method has applications ranging from user discrimination in
wireless TV broadcast systems to the prevention of eavesdrop-
ping in secret communications. By considering a wireless MIMO
system that consists of a multiple-antenna transmitter, a legitimate
receiver (LR) and an unauthorized receiver (UR), we propose
a multi-stage training-based discriminatory channel estimation
(DCE) scheme that aims to optimize the channel estimation perfor-
mance of the LR while limiting the channel estimation performance
of the UR. The key idea is to exploit the channel estimate fed back
from the LR at the beginning of each stage to enable the judicious
use of artificial noise (AN) in the training signal. Specifically, with
knowledge of the LR’s channel, AN can be properly superim-
posed with the training data to degrade the UR’s channel without
causing strong interference on the LR. The channel estimation
performance of the LR in earlier stages may not be satisfactory
due to the inaccuracy of the channel estimate and constraints on
the UR’s estimation performance, but can improve rapidly in later
stages as the quality of channel estimate improves. The training
data power and AN power are optimally allocated by minimizing
the normalized mean-square error (NMSE) of the LR subject to
a lower limit constraint on the NMSE of the UR. The proposed
DCE scheme is then extended to the case with multiple LRs and
multiple URs. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed DCE scheme.

and the prevention of eavesdropping by unauthorized receivers
(i.e., eavesdroppers) in secret communications. Conventionally,
these issues have been addressed through the use of application-
level techniques such as user authentication [1] or cryptography
[2]. However, these methods may be subject to vulnerabilities
and difficulties in key distribution and management, especially
in highly dynamic wireless networks [3], [4]. Recent develop-
ments in physical-layer secrecy [5]–[9] have shown that this in-
formation security problem can also be handled in the physical
layer by directly exploiting the different fading characteristics
between the legitimate and unauthorized receivers’ channels. It
has been shown that the transmitter can reliably broadcast mes-
sage signals to the legitimate receiver without having the unau-
thorized receiver infer any information from the message if QoS
discrimination between the legitimate and the unauthorized re-
ceivers is guaranteed. These physical-layer techniques, there-
fore, can provide information security without involving any
complex key exchange and management. Besides, they can be
used as a complement to higher-layer security techniques. For
example, one can use these physical-layer secrecy techniques to
strengthen the security of the key exchanging process [3], [4].
Most of the existing works on physical-layer secrecy focus on
the study of the maximum achievable perfect secrecy rate, i.e.,
the so called perfect secrecy capacity [5]–[9], from an informa-
tion theoretic point of view, or on the design of channel coding
or beamforming strategies [10]–[15] under the assumption that
both the legitimate and unauthorized receivers perfectly know
their channel state information (CSI). We instead investigate the
problem of QoS discrimination from the channel estimation per-
spective through the design of training signals for discriminating
between channel estimation performances at receivers. The pro-
posed training and channel estimation schemes, therefore, iden-
tify a completely new problem that has not been addressed in
the literature.
In this paper, we consider a wireless multiple-input multiple-
output (MIMO) system that consists of a multiple-antenna trans-
mitter and two (multiple-antenna) receivers, namely, the legiti-
mate receiver (LR) and the unauthorized receiver (UR). The UR
is assumed to be passive and it would not emit signals to prevent
communication between the transmitter and the LR. To discrim-
inate between the LR and the UR’s reception performances, we
propose a multistage training-based channel estimation scheme
that aims to optimize the channel estimation performance at the
LR while constraining the estimation performance attainable by
the UR. Inspired by the work of Goel and Negi [11], discrim-
ination of channel estimation performance is achieved by uti-
lizing artificial noise (AN) in the left null space of the LR’s

the training signals in both stages to refine their channel es-
timates, but the performance of the UR will be constrained
due to AN. The feedback-and-retraining process can be re-
peated multiple times, if necessary.
Assume that the feedback-and-retraining process is per-
formed times such that there is a total of stages in
the training process, and that the channels from the transmitter
to the LR and to the UR remain static over the entire training
process.2 Let denote the transmitted training
signal matrix in stage , with the signal length equal to . The
signals received by the LR and the UR are respectively given by
(1)
(2)
for , where the parameters are defined as fol-
lows:
The MIMO channel matrix of the LR. The
elements of are assumed to be inde-
pendent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)
random variables with zero mean and vari-
ance equal to .
The MIMO channel matrix of the UR. The
elements of are assumed to be i.i.d.
random variables with zero mean and vari-
ance equal to .
Additive (spatially and temporally) white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) matrix at the LR,
with the power of each entry equal to .
AWGN matrix at the UR, with the power
of each entry equal to .
Let be the training data power at stage , for
. The training signal matrices , ,
are designed as follows. In the initial stage (i.e., ), the
transmitter broadcasts a pure training signal
(3)
for preliminary channel estimation at the LR, where
is the training data matrix satisfying
in which represents the trace of a
matrix. The LR uses the received signal and the training
signal to obtain a preliminary estimate of , denoted by
, and sends back to the transmitter.
With knowledge of at the transmitter, we can then design
the training signals that contain AN in the left null space of
[11] in an attempt to corrupt the UR’s channel estimate.
Specifically, by assuming that , the training signal in
stage 1 is given by
(4)
2The impact of time-varying channels on the proposed DCE scheme will be
investigated by computer simulations in Section VI.
where represents the training data matrix sat-
isfying , is a matrix
that spans the left null space of and satisfies
(the by identity matrix) and
, and is an AN matrix with
each entry being i.i.d. zero-mean, complex Gaussian random
variables with variance equal to . It is worthwhile to notice
that the LR may also suffer from the AN added in (4) since the
estimate is in general not perfect [19]. Therefore, the alloca-
tion between the training data power and the AN power
should be designed carefully.
The training design rule used in (4) also applies to for
if multiple feedback-and-retraining stages are
performed. This will be discussed in detail in Section IV. In
the next section, we focus on the case of (one feed-
back-and-retraining stage) and present a design criterion for the
discrimination between the estimation performance of the LR
and that of the UR.
III. DISCRIMINATORY CHANNEL ESTIMATION FOR
In this section, we first analyze the channel estimation per-
formances of the LR and the UR, considering that the training
signal design proposed in the previous section is used with
. For simplicity of formulation, we assume that orthogonal
training data are used, that is, and .
Then, we find the optimal set of training data powers , , and
the AN power that minimizes the NMSE of the LR subject
to a lower limit constraint on the NMSE of the UR.
A. NMSE Analysis and Design Criterion
Let us assume that both the LR and the UR employ the
LMMSE criterion3 [23] for channel estimation. In that case, the
preliminary channel estimate of at the LR in the initial stage
(i.e., stage 0) is given by
(5)
(6)
where denotes the estimation error matrix.
One can show that has the correlation matrix given
by [23]
(7)
The NMSE of is then defined as
(8)

unbiased estimation (BLUE) are referred to [22].
CHANG et al.: TRAINING SEQUENCE DESIGN FOR DISCRIMINATORY CHANNEL ESTIMATION IN WIRELESS MIMO SYSTEMS 6227
whenever . This implies that, compared to using
only, the UR can obtain better channel estimation performance
by using both and , even though is poisoned by AN.
With (16) and (21), we propose to find the optimal set of
training data powers , and AN power by solving the
following optimization problem:
(24a)
(24b)
(24c)
where is the preassigned lower limit on the UR’s achiev-
able NMSE, and is the maximum average transmis-
sion power. By (3) and (4), the constraint in (24c) becomes
(25)
which represents an average energy constraint on the training
signals over both stages. We can see that the design criterion in
(24) aims to minimize the NMSE of the LR while enforcing the
NMSE of the UR to be no less than .
It is interesting to remark that, when
(26)
where the right-hand side is the minimum NMSE achievable
at the UR without any interference from the AN, problem (24)
yields the trivial solution where and , are
any values that satisfy . This
implies that no AN is needed and thus there is no performance
discrimination between receivers. Moreover, by (22), (23), and
(24b), it must hold that
(27)
where follows from the fact that . Hence, in the
following, we shall consider only the interesting case of
(28)
B. Optimal Power Allocation
To illustrate how problem (24) can be solved, let us define
, , and
(29)
In this case, the condition in (28) reduces to
(30)
Then we can reformulate problem (24) into the following max-
imization problem:
(31a)
(31b)
(31c)
By close inspection of the problem structure of (31), we show in
the following proposition that the three-dimensional optimiza-
tion problem can be solved by a simple one-dimensional line
search. The proof is given in Appendix A.
Proposition 1: Let be the optimum solution to
the nonconvex optimization problem in (31) with
. For
(32)
the optimal solution to problem (31) is given by (i.e., no
AN is needed) and any , such that (e.g.,
). On the other hand, for , the optimum
value of (i.e., ) can be obtained by solving the following
one-variable optimization problem:
(33a)
(33b)
where
(34)
(35)
The associated values of and are given by and ,
respectively.
Proposition 1 implies that a globally optimal solution of
problem (31) and, thus, problem (24) can be conveniently
obtained via a simple line search with respect to over the in-
terval , provided that ; otherwise a simple
closed-form solution can be readily obtained with and,
e.g., . To gain more insights from Proposition
1, one may interpret in (32) as a measure of channel quality
difference between the UR and the LR. When , it implies
that the UR is under a much worse channel condition (either
with a larger noise power or a smaller channel variance) than
the LR, so there is no need to use AN to interfere with the UR.
However, when or even , which implies that the
UR has a comparable or even better channel condition than the
LR, additional AN has to be transmitted in order to limit the
UR’s channel estimation performance.

(42c) [(43)] but may not satisfy the constraint in (42b). To solve
this, one can simultaneously scale down
such that (42b) holds with equality to obtain an initial set of
feasible power values for problem (42). By our experience in
simulations, this simple initialization approach works well for
the condensation method in Table I.
V. DISCRIMINATORY CHANNEL ESTIMATION WITH
MULTIPLE LRS AND URS
In the previous sections, we have focused on the scenario
where there is only one LR and one UR. In this section, we ex-
tend the proposed DCE scheme to the case with multiple LRs
and multiple URs.
Assume that there are LRs, each equipped with an-
tennas, and URs, each equipped with antennas, and
that . Let denote the MIMO
channel matrix between the transmitter and the LR, and let
denote the MIMO channel matrix between the
transmitter and the UR. The elements of and are
i.i.d. random variables with zero mean and variances equal to
and , respectively. The received signals at LR and
UR are respectively given by
(46)
(47)
for , where and
are the AWGN with the power of each entry equal to
and , respectively. Let be the channel
estimate of the LR obtained at stage , and assume that all
the LRs send back their channel estimates to the transmitter.
Then similar to (3) and (36), the training signals are given by
(48)
(49)
where is a matrix that spans the left
null space of the channel estimate
(50)
Since the training signals are broadcast to all the receivers, both
LRs and URs can use the same training signals
to perform channel estimation. Hence, the NMSE of the LRs
and that of the URs have the same structures as those in (40)
and (41), respectively. The training design formulated in (24)
and (42) can then be extended to the case with multiple LRs
and multiple URs by minimizing the worst NMSE performance
among LRs subject to NMSE constraints on all the URs. The
design formulation is given as follows
(51a)
(51b)
(51c)
Here, and denote the NMSEs of the
LR and the UR at stage , respectively. Problem (51)
can be efficiently approximated by the monomial approximation
and condensation method in a way similar to that presented in
Section IV and Appendix B.
The design problem in (51) can be simplified for the spe-
cial case where and
. In particular, by (40) and (41) one can
see that the LR with the largest would have the largest
, and the UR with the smallest would have
the smallest . In this case, one needs only to con-
sider the performances of these two users in the training signal
design. For example, if and
, then the design problem in (51)
can be reduced to
(52a)
(52b)
(52c)
which is similar to problem (42) in this special case.
VI. SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
In this section, simulation results are presented to demon-
strate the efficacy of the proposed training signal design and
DCE scheme. We first consider the wireless system shown in

and UR 3) (see Section V). We set and ,
and let all the channels of LRs and URs have unit variance (i.e.,
and ). The SNRs of
LR 1 and LR 2 are set to 30 and 20 dB, respectively. The SNRs
of UR 1, UR 2 and UR 3 were set to 40, 30, and 20 dB. Ac-
cording to (52), we only consider to minimize the NMSE of LR
2 subject to an NMSE constraint on UR 1. Fig. 4 displays the
NMSE performances of LRs and URs for . We can see
from this figure that the NMSEs of all URs are successfully con-
strained above 0.03, while the NMSEs of the two LRs rapidly
decrease as increases. Moreover, LR 1 has better NMSE per-
formance than LR 2 since the former has a higher SNR value.
4) Example 4: As the final simulation example, we inves-
tigate the performance of the proposed DCE scheme in time-
varying channels. The motivation of conducting such a simu-
lation is that the channel from the transmitter to the LR and
that from the transmitter to the UR may have changed from
one stage to another during the DCE process. For simplicity,
we assumed one LR and one UR, and set ,
, and in this simulation example.
Let us define and as the transmitter-to-LR and trans-
mitter-to-UR channel matrices at time for . We
assumed that each of the entries of and vary from
one time sample to another following the rule of Jakes’ channel
model [29]. Let and be the entry of
and , respectively. Suppose that the LR and the UR have
the same maximum Doppler frequency . The autocorrela-
tion of and that of by Jakes’ model are given by
where the superscript “*” denotes the complex conjugate,
is the zero-order Bessel function of the first kind and is the
system sampling rate. Since both and are time-varying
from to , we take the NMSEs of the channel
estimates of and as the performance measures.
In Fig. 5(a) and (b), we show the NMSE performance for the
Doppler rate , and for and ,
respectively. By comparing Fig. 5(b) with Fig. 2(b), it can be
observed that the LR’s NMSE performance degrades and ex-
hibits an error floor since the added AN may leak into LR’s
channel due to the time-varying channels. To further see how
the time-varying channel can affect the proposed DCE scheme,
we show in Fig. 5(c) the NMSE performance with respect to the

important to devise improved schemes to reduce the complexity
burden at the LR and the required number of feedback-and-re-
training stages. For example, the low-complexity recursive least
squares algorithm [32] may be applied to (36) to implement
LR’s LMMSE channel estimation in a recursive, stage-by-stage
manner. Further research efforts to improve the discrimination
performance of the proposed DCE scheme in time-varying
channels are also needed. These practical issues certainly bring
some interesting and challenging research directions in the
future.
The presented DCE scheme may also suggest relevant future
research directions in information theory. For example, one may
consider analyzing the achievable perfect secrecy rate under im-
perfect CSI at the LR and the UR. This is in sharp contrast to
most existing works where both receivers are assumed to have
perfect CSI [6]–[9]. It is anticipated that a higher perfect secrecy
rate can be achieved if the UR does not have an accurate channel
estimate.
APPENDIX A
PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1
Here we prove Proposition 1. We see from (31b) that a fea-
sible must satisfy . Suppose that a feasible is
given to problem (31). We can first find the optimal values of
and as a function of by solving the following optimization
problem:
(A1a)
(A1b)
(A1c)
Let be the optimal solution of problem (A1). One
can inspect that constraint(A1b) must be active when the op-
timal objective value is achieved; otherwise, one can always ob-
tain a larger objective value by decreasing . If constraint
(A1b) is not active even when , then one can instead
increase to obtain a larger objective value. Since we only
consider the interesting case where [see
(30)], constraint (A1b) must be active with if
. Hence, we have that
(A2)
By substituting (A2) into(A1), problem (A1a) reduces to
(A3a)
(A3b)
One can show that the objective function in (A3a) is monotoni-
cally decreasing with respect to for
(A4)
In this case, the optimum value of is equal to 0, and the
associated objective value is given by .

(A11c)–(A11e) such that the optimization variables are all on
the left-hand side of the inequalities. Since problem (A11)
involves only non-negative optimization variables, we seek to
handle it by the GP [20]. A standard GP can be expressed as
follows:
(A12a)
(A12b)
(A12c)
where are monomials taking the form
(A13)
in which and are real numbers for all
, and are posynomials taking the form
(A14)
in which and are real numbers for all and .
As seen, a posynomials is simply non-negative weighted sum
of monomials. Comparing problem (A11) with the standard GP
in (A12), one can see that the objective function and all the in-
equality constraints of problem (A11) are posynomials, except
for the constraints in (A11b). In fact, the inequality constraints
in (A11b) can only be expressed as ratios of posynomials as
(A15)
which are known to be difficult to deal with in general.
To resolve these hard constraints and to obtain an effective
approximate solution of problem (A11), we apply the con-
densation method and the monomial approximation technique
[24]. The idea of the monomial approximation technique is
to locally approximate the posynomial in the denominator
of the left-hand side of (A15) by a monomial function, and
the condensation method is to find an approximate solution
of problem (A11) by successively solving the monomial-ap-
proximated problem. Specifically, given a feasible point
of problem (A11), one can
show [24] that
(A16)
by the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means, where
(A17a)
(A17b)
(A17c)
(A17d)
and
(A18)
The right-hand side of (A16) is a monomial function. The mono-
mial approximation technique is to replace (A15) by the fol-
lowing constraint:
(A19)
which are posynomials, and guarantee the satisfaction of (A15).
Therefore, given a feasible point of
, problem (A11) is locally approximated by the
problem [see (A20a)–(A20e) at the top of the page]. Since (A20)
now is a standard GP [see (A12)], it can be efficiently solved
by general purpose interior point solvers such as CVX [25] in
a polynomial-time complexity. Then the condensation method
[24] finds an approximate solution of problem (A11) by itera-
tively solving a sequence of problems (A20) with each initial
feasible point given by the
optimum solution of (A20) in the previous iteration. In Table I,
we summarize the condensation method for problem (42).

time coding schemes, e.g., [11]; however they suffer from a 3
dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss compared to the coherent
receiver. In our previous works in [14]–[16], a noncoherent
OSTBC-OFDM detection method based on the deterministic
blind maximum-likelihood (ML) criterion was proposed. It
was shown that this noncoherent detection method can exhibit
near-coherent performance using only one OSTBC-OFDM
block, thus appealing for fast time-varying channels. However,
channel coding was not considered in [14]–[16].
In this paper, we consider the convolutional coded BICM-
OSTBC-OFDM system, and aim to develop a noncoherent
BICM-OSTBC-OFDM decoder that also uses one OSTBC-
OFDM block. We assume that the time-domain multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) multi-path channel coefficients are
i.i.d. Rayleigh distributed. By exploiting the inter-subcarrier
relationship of OFDM [14], we develop a block-wise non-
coherent ML decoder and present a complexity-reduced im-
plementation method. The primary focus of this paper is on
the performance aspects, aiming to show the potential per-
formance advantages of the proposed noncoherent approach.
Firstly, like most of the noncoherent methods, the presented
noncoherent ML decoder can be subject to the data ambiguity
problem in the noise-free situation. We review some of the
transmission schemes reported in [14]–[16], which can be
directly used for the considered BICM-OSTBC-OFDM system
for unique codeword decoding; e.g., the pilot-efficient perfect
channel identifiability (PCI) achieving schemes [15], [16].
Secondly, we analyze the diversity order of the noncoherent
ML decoder. To distinguish it from the diversity achieved by
a coherent decoder, we refer to the diversity order achieved
by the noncoherent decoder as noncoherent diversity. While
the fundamental definitions of diversity are the same for both
coherent and noncoherent systems, the characterization of the
noncoherent diversity is much more difficult [17], [18]. In
addition, the involvement of channel coding in this work
further increases the challenge of the noncoherent diversity
analysis. To overcome this issue, we present a worst-case
diversity analysis framework for BICM-OSTBC-OFDM, and
use it to show that PCI-achieving schemes can fully harvest
both the maximum noncoherent spatial and frequency diver-
sities. Finally, as a meaningful scenario variation, we extend
the noncoherent ML decoder and diversity analysis framework
to a distributed BICM-OSTBC-OFDM scenario arising from
cooperative relay networks.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
Section II, the system model is introduced. In Section III, the
noncoherent ML decoder is derived and a complexity-reduced
implementation method is presented. Section IV presents the
unique data identification conditions and noncoherent diversity
analysis. Extension to the distributed scenario is presented in
Section V. Simulation results are shown in Section VI. Section
VII draws the conclusions.

II. SYSTEM MODEL
We consider a point-to-point BICM-OSTBC-OFDM system
with Nt transmit antennas and Nr receive antennas. Frequency
selective multi-path channel fading between the transmitter
and the receiver is assumed. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the trans-
mitter is composed of two parts: (i) the outer convolutional
coded BICM part which consists of a convolutional encoder
and a bit interleaver [1]; (ii) the inner OSTBC-OFDM modu-
lator [14], [19]. The convolutional encoder, which has a code

The above noncoherent ML decoding problem can be han-
dled by the Viterbi decoder as in coherent ML [5]. However,
the noncoherent ML case in (10) is much more complex to
process. Specifically, in the trellis search of the noncoherent
Viterbi decoder, we have to solve the following two discrete
optimization problems in order to decide ck:
max

sn,i=μ(ck)
Tr
(
YHG(s)GH(s)Y
)
(11)
s.t. ck = 1 (or ck = 0).
The above two optimization problems are in fact the noncoher-
ent ML detection problem studied in the context of uncoded
OSTBC-OFDM [14]. While it has been shown in [14] that (11)
can be recast as a Boolean quadratic program (BQP), which
can be efficiently handled by a convex approximation method,
namely, semidefinite relaxation (SDR) [22], [23], the total
complexity required for solving the noncoherent ML decoding
problem (10) is still much higher compared to the coherent ML
decoder in (3). To overcome this implementation issue, instead
we present in the next subsection a heuristic complexity-
reduced implementation method with good performance.
B. Complexity-Reduced Implementation
It is interesting to note that the inner maximization problem
in (10) can be expressed as [14]
max

‖Y − G(s)H‖2F
}
, (12)
where the minimization problem is known as the deterministic
blind ML detector in the literature [14]. By substituting (12)
into (10), we can rewrite problem (10) as
cˆ=argmin

K¯∑

s∈{±1}K¯
sn,i=μ(ck)
{

}
.
(13)
In contrast to the coherent ML decoder in (3) where the
channel H is given, the inner minimization term of the non-
coherent decoder (13) implicitly performs joint (modulated)
data detection and channel estimation. This simple observation
motivates us to handle the noncoherent ML decoding problem
(10) in a two-step approach — first solve the deterministic
blind ML problem
{sˆ, Hˆ} = arg min
s∈{±1}K¯
{
min
H∈CLNt×Nr
‖Y − G(s)H‖2F
}
(14)
to obtain a channel estimate Hˆ, followed by coherently
decoding the codeword c by (3) using Hˆ as the true channel.
In accordance with (12), the optimal (s,H) of (14) can be
obtained by
sˆ = arg max
s∈{±1}K¯
Tr
(
YHG(s)GH(s)Y
)
, (15a)
Hˆ = arg min
H∈CLNt×Nr
‖Y − G(sˆ)H‖2F = GH(sˆ)Y . (15b)
As mentioned above, problem (15a) can be efficiently handled
by the convex SDR approximation method. As a result,
the two-step approach only involves solving a convex SDR
problem and the coherent ML decoding problem (3). This
alternative is therefore computationally much cheaper than
directly solving problem (10). While, for a large scale prob-
lem where Nc is large, (15a) is still more complex than
conventional pilot-aided channel estimation methods (e.g.,
least squares (LS) and minimum mean-squared error (MMSE)
channel estimators [24]), we should emphasize that divide-
and-conquer strategies such as subchannel grouping [14]
and low-complexity SDR solvers (e.g., [23]) can be further
employed for efficient implementation. As we will show
in the simulation section, the presented complexity-reduced
approach performs very well.
IV. UNIQUE DATA IDENTIFIABILITY AND DIVERSITY
ANALYSIS
Having considered the implementation of noncoherent ML
decoding in the last section, we now turn our attention to
the fundamental performance aspects. In the first subsection,
we review some transmission schemes reported in [14]–[16]
that can guarantee unique data identification, i.e., guarantee
the codeword c to be uniquely decoded by the noncoherent
ML decoder (10) in the noise-free situation. In the second
subsection, we present our main results on the diversity order
of the noncoherent ML decoder (10).
A. Unique Data and Channel Identification
As a common issue in noncoherent approaches, the non-
coherent ML decoder (10) is subject to data ambiguity in the
noise-free situation. In particular, one can easily verify that the
two problems in (11) have the same optimal objective value
since if s is an optimal solution of the problem with ck = 1,
then −s is optimal to the other with ck = 0, and vice versa.
This implies that the noncoherent ML decoder (10) is not
able to uniquely determine whether ck is equal to one or zero.
To ensure that c can be uniquely identified in the noise-free
situation, we need to guarantee that the unconstrained problem
(without the bit mapping constraint sn,i = μ(ck))
max
s∈{±1}K¯
Tr
(
YHG(s)GH(s)Y
)
(16)
can uniquely identify the true s in the absence of noise. Since,
by (12), problem (16) is equivalent to (14), it is sufficient to
guarantee that the following ambiguity condition
G(s)H = G(s′)H′ (17)
holds only when s = s′ and H = H′, i.e., unique data and
channel identification.

and uncoded space-time systems [20]. The only resem-
blance one may roughly see is that each constituent term
det−1
(
ILNt +
σ2hβ2
σ2w
Ω(s¯, sˆ)
)
of (23) is somehow similar to
the PEP upper bound for uncoded space-time systems [20];
the precise expression is nevertheless different upon close
inspection, and we have to deal with a sum of such terms
in (23).
Proposition 1 gives an important insight into analysis on
the noncoherent BICM-OSTBC-OFDM diversity. As in the
coherent scenario, the noncoherent diversity is defined as the
high-SNR slope of the PEP in a log-log scale over all possible
pairs of c¯ and cˆ [27]:
DNC = min
c¯ =cˆ
{
lim
σ2h/σ
2
w→∞
− log Pr(c¯ → cˆ|c¯)
log(σ2h/σ
2
w)
}
. (26)
Substituting (23) into (26), we show in Appendix B that
the noncoherent diversity order of the BICM-OSTBC-OFDM
system is lower bounded as
DNC ≥ DNC  min
c¯ =cˆ
{
min
sˆ∈S(cˆ)
rank(Ω(s¯, sˆ))
}
. (27)
The intuition behind (27) is that the PEP upper bound in
(23) is asymptotically dominated by the constituent term
det−1
(
ILNt +
σ2hβ2
σ2w
Ω(s¯, sˆ)
)
that is least diminishing with
the SNR, and DNC in (27) captures the worst diversity order
of that term among all possible pairs of c¯ and cˆ. We will
henceforth call DNC the worst-case noncoherent diversity
order.
Next we analyze the worst-case noncoherent diversity or-
ders of the three transmission schemes presented in the pre-
vious subsection. We will need the following assumption on
the bit interleaver:
A1) For any codeword pair c¯ and cˆ, there exists a subindex set
{k′1, . . . , k′dfree} ⊆ {k1, . . . , kd} such that {c¯k′1 , . . . , c¯k′dfree }
are mapped by the bit interleaver onto different subcarriers,
say, {n′1, . . . , n′dfree} ⊆ {n1, . . . , nd} where n′i = n′k for all
i = k.
Assumption A1) basically says that the bit interleaver has to
be ‘random’ enough. Under A1), we prove in Appendix C the
following theorem on the noncoherent diversity:
Theorem 1 Assume that A1) holds. If the PCI-achieving
schemes, e.g., the L-pilot-code scheme and the xL-pilot-bit
scheme, are employed, then DNC = Ntmin(dfree, L).
Since Ntmin(dfree, L) is also the maximum diversity that
can be achieved by the coherent ML decoder in (3) [5],
Theorem 1 indicates that the L-pilot-code scheme and the xL-
pilot-bit scheme can achieve the maximum spatial-frequency
diversity offered by the system in a noncoherent manner.
Interestingly, the one-pilot-code scheme, which is not PCI-
achieving, may not benefit from the use of BICM to harvest
the frequency diversity:
Corollary 1 When the one-pilot-code scheme is employed, the
worst-case diversity is no larger than Nt, i.e., DNC ≤ Nt.

Corollary 1 will be further corroborated by simulations in
Section VI.
V. EXTENSION TO DISTRIBUTED BICM-OSTBC-OFDM
In this section, we extend the noncoherent ML decoder
in (10) to a relay-based distributed BICM-OSTBC-OFDM
system. In this system, as illustrated in Fig. 2, a set of single-
antenna relays collaborate to transmit the information bits
sent from the source to a destination receiver. The direct
link between the source and the destination is not considered.
We assume that the relays employ the decode-and-forward
(DF) strategy. Moreover, we assume that there is no central
control and the relays may choose to join the cooperation or
not, depending on whether they can successfully decode the
information bits from the source. Suppose that there are Ns
cooperating relays, and that the relays employ the distributed
OSTBC scheme in [28]. Specifically, given the information
bits b ∈ {0, 1}K¯Rc , the mth relay transmits the block sequence
Cn(sn)qm ∈ CT over subcarrier n, for n = 1, . . . , Nc, where
Cn(sn) is the OSTBC mapping function defined in Section
II, and qm ∈ CNt is a preassigned signature sequence for
the mth relay. The signature sequences q1, . . . ,qNs may be
designed to enhance the receiver performance [28]; here we
assume that qm are given and fixed. Let H ∈ CLNs×Nr be
the channels from all the cooperating relays to the destination.
Then the received signal for subcarrier n is given by
Yn = Cn(sn)Q(INs ⊗ fTn )H+Wn
= Cn(sn)(INt ⊗ fTn )Hv +Wn, (28)
where Q = [q1, . . . ,qNs ] ∈ CNt×Ns , Hv  (Q ⊗ IL)H ∈
CLNt×Nr is the virtual channel, and the second equality
is obtained by using the Kronecker product property (A ⊗
B)(C⊗D) = (AC⊗BD) [29]. The received OSTBC-OFDM
block signal is thus given by

Example 1: Performance of point-to-point BICM-
OSTBC-OFDM: Fig. 3 presents the bit error performance of
the three schemes in Section IV-A for L = 4 and Nr = 4. The
1/2-rate convolutional code with generator polynomials (7, 5)8
and dfree = 5 is used. In this figure, we also present the bit
error rates (BERs) of the ideal coherent Viterbi decoder (VD)
in (3) which has perfect CSI [5], the ideal uncoded coherent
ML detector, and the pilot-aided LS and MMSE channel esti-
mators [24]. The LS and MMSE channel estimators employ L
equispaced pilot-code subcarriers for channel estimation and
use the channel estimate for coherent ML decoding. There are
two points to note from Fig. 3. Firstly, one can observe that
the coherent VD, the LS and MMSE channel estimators, the
L-pilot-code scheme, and the xL-pilot-bit scheme (with either
x = 1 or x = 3) all exhibit the same diversity performance.
Since the coherent VD can harvest all the diversity advantages
offered by the system [5], this result implies that the L-
pilot-code scheme and the xL-pilot-bit scheme also enjoy
the same diversity advantages4. By contrast, we observe that
the one-pilot-code scheme only achieves a similar diversity
performance as the uncoded coherent ML detector. Since the
uncoded coherent detector is known to be able to achieve
the spatial diversity only, this result implies that the one-
pilot-code scheme harvests at most the spatial diversity. All
these results are consistent with our analyses in Theorem 1
and Corollary 1. Secondly, we observe that the xL-pilot-bit
scheme with x = 1 has a slightly higher BER than the LS
and MMSE channel estimators; whereas, when x increases
to 3, the xL-pilot-bit scheme performs almost on a par with
the L-pilot-code scheme and outperforms the LS and MMSE
channel estimators. Specifically, as one can see, the xL-pilot-
bit scheme with x = 3 has around 2.8 dB Eb/N0 advantage
over the LS and MMSE channel estimators at BER= 10−5.
We should note that with x = 3 the xL-pilot-bit scheme
consumes 4L bits per OSTBC-OFDM block due to pilots and
4While the corresponding log-log BER slopes are not as high as the
theoretic value (which is 32), they will increase to the theoretic value as
Eb/N0 increases.

NIS-OSTBCs5; while all the L-pilot-code scheme, the LS and
MMSE channel estimators have an 8L-bit loss per OSTBC-
OFDM block. Fig. 4 displays the performance comparison
results between the xL-pilot-bit scheme (with x = 3) and
the LS channel estimator, for Nr = 3 and for L = 2, 5
and 8. We can observe from the figure that both schemes
have improved diversity performance as L increases from 2
to 5, but the diversity order remains the same as L increases
from 5 to 8. The reason is that, according to Theorem 1, the
maximum frequency diversity is dfree = 5 when L ≥ dfree.
One can also see from Fig. 4 that the xL-pilot-bit scheme
outperforms the LS channel estimator for all L. In Fig. 5, we
show the BER performance for L = 8 and Nr = 4 by using
the 1/2-rate convolutional code with generator polynomials
(171, 133)8 and dfree = 10 (this code is popularly used in
real systems). Similar comparison results as in Fig. 3 can be
observed.
Example 2: Performance under mobile time-varying
channels: Throughout this paper, we have used the block
fading assumption to model fast fading channels. The block
fading assumption is considered reasonable when the channel
coherence time is no smaller than one OSTBC-OFDM block,
although it is interesting to examine how our methods actually
perform under a more realistic mobile time-varying fading
channel. This example aims to do so. We assume that the
elements of H vary with time following Jakes’ model [31].
The carrier frequency is set to 2.6 GHz and the sampling
frequency is set to 1/Ts = 3.84 MHz (e.g., LTE). We try
two settings with the normalized Doppler frequency, namely,
NcfdTs = 0.0843 (corresponding to a moving speed 525
km/h) and NcfdTs = 0.0422 (corresponding to a moving
speed 263 km/h), where fd is the maximum Doppler shift.
One can see from Fig. 6 that the xL-pilot-bit scheme still
yields consistent bit error performance and outperforms the

property; please see [25] for the details.

APPENDIX A
PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1
By (22) and the fact that c¯k = cˆk for all  = 1, . . . , d, the
PEP Pr(c¯ → cˆ|c¯) can be upper bounded in (32) as shown on

. By
substituting (21) into (32) and by applying the fact that
Pr(α1 + α2 ≥ t) ≤ Pr(α1 ≥ t/2 or α2 ≥ t/2) ≤ Pr(α1 ≥
t/2) + Pr(α2 ≥ t/2) for any two random variables α1 and
α2, we further obtain (34) on the next page.
To compute P1 and P2 in (34), let us define S(cˆ) shown
in (35). Also, for each sˆ ∈ S(cˆ), define a set R(sˆ) in (36),
i.e., sy = sˆ for all w ∈ R(sˆ). According to the law of
total probability, we can compute P1 in (37) as shown on
the next page. To compute right-hand side (RHS) of (37),
noting that by the fact that GH(s¯)G(s¯) = ILNt , GH(s¯)Δ(sˆ)
can be expressed in (38) shown on the next page, where
Ψ⊥  INcT − G(sˆ())GH(sˆ()) is a projection matrix, i.e.,

where Ω(s¯, sˆ) is defined in (25). On the other hand, using the
similar idea as in (37) for handling P1 and by applying [32,
Lemma 2], one can show that P2 can be upper bounded as
P2 ≤

Finally, the end result in (23) is obtained by deriving the
expectation in (42) with respect to the i.i.d. complex Gaussian
h [20]. 

APPENDIX C
PROOF OF THEOREM 1
By (25), Ω(s¯, sˆ) can be expressed as
Ω(s¯, sˆ) = ILNt − ZHWWHZ  0, (45)
where W = blkdiag
(G(sˆ(1)),G(sˆ(2)), . . . ,G(sˆ(d))) ∈
CdNcT×dLNt (which is a block diagonal matrix) and Z =
1√
d
(1d ⊗ G(s¯)) ∈ CdNcT×LNt . Since WHW = IdLNt and
ZHZ = ILNt , we have ‖WHZ‖2 ≤ ‖W‖2‖Z‖2 = 1, which
implies that all the singular values of WHZ are no larger than
one. Hence determining the rank of Ω(s¯, sˆ) is equivalent to
identifying the number of the singular values of WHZ equal
to one. Let η be the number of singular values of WHZ equal
to one. Then rank(Ω(s¯, sˆ)) = LNt − η. To proceed, we will
need the following lemma which is proved in [16]:
Lemma 1 [16] The matrix WHZ ∈ CdLNt×LNt has η ≥
1 singular values equal to one if and only if there exist
two linearly independent sets {x1, . . . ,xη} ∈ CdLNt and
{y1, . . . ,yη} ∈ CLNt such that Wxm = Zym, m =
1, . . . , η.
According to the above lemma, we obtain that

, (46)
 = 1, . . . , d, m = 1, . . . , η,
where xm = [(x(1)m )T , . . . , (x(d)m )T ]T . Firstly, as mentioned
in Section IV-A, for PCI-achieving schemes such as the L-
pilot-code and xL-pilot-bit schemes, (46) holds only if x()m =
1√
d
ym,  = 1, . . . , d, m = 1, . . . , η. Secondly, since c¯k′ =
cˆk′ for  = 1, . . . , dfree, it holds that sˆ

n′
= s¯n′ for  =
1, . . . , dfree; moreover, under A1), we have n′i = n′k for all

(INt⊗fT1 )ym = 0, m = 1, . . . , η. Since the nullity of INt⊗fT1
is LNt −Nt, WHZ can have η = LNt −Nt singular values
equal to one, implying that rank(Ω(s¯, sˆ)) = Nt for this
special case. Hence, we have DNC ≤ Nt. 

Noncoherent OSTBC-OFDM for MIMO and
Cooperative Communications: Perfect Channel
Identifiability and Achievable Diversity Order
Tsung-Hui Chang, Member, IEEE, Wing-Kin Ma, Senior Member, IEEE, Chuan-Yuan Huang, and
Chong-Yung Chi, Senior Member, IEEE
Abstract—This paper considers the context of orthogonal
space-time block coded OFDM (OSTBC-OFDM) without channel
state information at the receiver. Assuming noncoherent max-
imum-likelihood detection, the interest herein lies in detection
within one OSTBC-OFDM block, motivated by its capability of
accommodating relatively fast block fading channels. Our inves-
tigation focuses on analysis aspects, where we seek to establish
practical noncoherent BPSK/QPSK OSTBC-OFDM schemes
that have provably good channel identifiability and diversity
properties. We consider perfect channel identifiability (PCI), a
strong condition guaranteeing unique noncoherent channel iden-
tification for any (nonzero) channel. Through a judicious design
involving special OSTBCs and pilot placement, we propose an
OSTBC-OFDM scheme that is PCI-achieving and consumes fewer
pilots compared to conventional pilot-aided channel estimation
methods. We further our analysis by showing that a PCI-achieving
scheme also achieves maximal noncoherent spatial diversity for
the Kronecker Gaussian spatial-temporal channel fading model,
which covers the popular i.i.d. Rayleigh fading channel and a
variety of correlated and sparse multipath channels. All these
results are developed in parallel for the centralized point-to-point
MIMO scenario and a distributed relay communication scenario.
For the latter scenario, our diversity analysis shows that the
PCI-achieving scheme can also achieve maximal noncoherent
cooperative diversity. The performance merits of the proposed
PCI-achieving scheme are demonstrated by simulations.

I. INTRODUCTION
O RTHOGONAL space-time block coded OFDM(OSTBC-OFDM) is a popular physical-layer scheme
for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communications over
frequency selective fading channels, offering diversity gains
in a convenient way. Owing to its low encoding and decoding
complexities, in addition, OSTBC-OFDM has been used in
modern communication systems such as Wi-Fi, WiMAX and
LTE [2]. To fully harvest the performance gains, the receiver
requires accurate channel state information (CSI), which, how-
ever, demands sufficient resources being allocated to training
or pilot data. Therefore, receiver techniques without CSI at
the receiver (CSIR) are of great interest. In this scope, pop-
ular approaches include the differential methods [3], [4], and
blind/semiblind signal detection methods [5]–[7]. Moreover,
in the information theoretic literature [8]–[12], no-CSIR de-
tection approaches are generally called noncoherent detection,
to contrast with coherent detection which assumes perfect
CSIR. From this perspective, both differential and blind/semi-
blind approaches may be regarded as being under the class of
noncoherent detection. In fact, even the conventional coherent
detection approach using pilot-aided channel estimation may be
seen as noncoherent detection, and treated under a noncoherent
analysis framework [9]–[12]. In this paper, we will alterna-
tively call blind/semiblind detection methods noncoherent
detection methods, for convenience of describing an important
property—noncoherent diversity.
For noncoherent detection of OSTBC-OFDM, the differential
methods [3], [4] are well known to inherently suffer from a 3 dB
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss. A simple alternative for nonco-
herent OSTBC-OFDM detection [6] is to employ noncoherent
techniques for flat fading channels (see, e.g., [10]–[13]) for each
subcarrier, i.e., subcarrier-by-subcarrier processing. However,
this subcarrier-wise method usually assumes that the channel is
static for a large number of OSTBC-OFDM blocks1. Another
approach, which has been actively studied in signal processing,
is to apply subspace-based blind and semiblind channel estima-
tion methods [14]–[17]. Similar to the subcarrier-wise method,
the subspace-based channel estimation methods [14]–[17] also
require a large number of OSTBC-OFDM blocks for achieving
near-coherent performance. These methods are therefore more
suitable for slow fading channels.

OSTBC length, as will be defined in Section II.

ently achieve the maximum cooperative diversity of the
cooperative system.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II re-
views the OSTBC-OFDM system model, the block-wise non-
coherent ML detector, and existing channel identifiability re-
sults in [7]. The DOSTBC-OFDM system model is also pre-
sented in that section. In Section III, the proposed PCI-achieving
OSTBC-OFDM scheme is presented. Section IV presents the
diversity analysis results. Simulations results are presented in
Section V to examine the performance of the proposed PCI-
achieving scheme. The conclusions are given in Section VI.

II. REVIEW OF NONCOHERENT OSTBC-OFDM
We present a background review of the noncoherent
OSTBC-OFDM system studied in [7]. The OSTBC-OFDM
system model and the noncoherent ML detection approach
are first reviewed in the first and second subsections. The
scenario under consideration is the point-to-point MIMO. In
the third subsection, we illustrate how the described technique
can be extended to the relay-based distributed OSTBC-OFDM
scenario. The last subsection then reviews the existing results
on unique channel identifiability.
A. OSTBC-OFDM Signal Model
We consider a standard point-to-point OSTBC-OFDM
system [7], [15] where the transmitter has antennas and the
receiver has antennas. Let be the number of subcarriers,
and be the space-time code length. Under the assumption that
the channel is static for OFDM symbols, or equivalently, one
OSTBC-OFDM block, the received signal can be modeled as
(1)
where
received code matrix at subcarrier ;
transmitted bit vector for subcarrier
where is the number of bits per
code;
OSTBC mapping function for subcarrier
;
MIMO channel frequency response
matrix for subcarrier ;
AWGN matrix for subcarrier where
each entry is assumed to be zero mean
and have an average power .
We will concentrate on OSTBCs with BPSK or QPSK constel-
lations. For such cases, the OSTBC mapping functions exhibit
a linear structure [37]
(2)
where is the entry of , and
are the basis matrices of . Moreover, satisfies the
semi-unitary property
(3)
We should note that unlike coherent OSTBC-OFDM, where a
common space-time code is often employed for all subcarriers
[i.e., ], assuming non-identical
over subcarriers is essential to the noncoherent OSTBC-OFDM
development in the ensuing sections.
B. Block-Wise Noncoherent ML OSTBC-OFDM Detection
The emphasis of this paper is on noncoherent OSTBC-OFDM
detection; that is, approaches that detect the information
bits , without knowing the channels
a priori. In particular, we focus on
the block-wise noncoherent ML detection approach [7], in
which only one OSTBC-OFDM block is used for noncoherent
detection. As mentioned previously, the block-wise approach
is attractive in allowing us to deal with relatively fast fading
channels where the channel coherence interval can be as short
as that of one OSTBC-OFDM block. The key ingredient that
leads to this block-wise noncoherent detection approach is to
exploit the fact that each is parameterized by a common
time-domain MIMO channel. To illustrate this, let
(4)
be the collection of all time-domainMIMO channel coefficients,
where in which
is the channel impulse response vector from the
transmit antenna to the receive antenna, and is the
channel length in time. Moreover, let
(5)
be the DFT vector for subcarrier , in which . Then,
each is physically a MIMO Fourier transform of ; pre-
cisely we have the following expression:
(6)
(7)
CHANG et al.: NONCOHERENT OSTBC-OFDM FOR MIMO AND COOPERATIVE COMMUNICATIONS 4853
resents the channel impulse response vector between the
cooperating relay and the receive antenna. By using the Kro-
necker product property [40],
we can reformulate (15) as
(17)
(18)
It is important to note that in terms of formulations, (17) is iden-
tical to the point-to-point OSTBC-OFDMmodel in (8), with the
physical time-domain channel replaced by the virtual time-
domain channel . In a coherent scenario, it has been shown
that the randomized distributed space-time coding approach can
achieve the same spatial diversity as that of its point-to-point
counterpart, for certain appropriate randomizations of [26].
This paper focuses on the noncoherent version of the
DOSTBC-OFDM scheme. This scenario is motivated not
only by fast fading environments as mentioned previously,
but also by an issue arising from the decentralized nature of
the scheme—the relays themselves may choose to join or not
to join at any time, and this can cause significant variations
of the virtual channel from one OSTBC-OFDM block to
another [28]. In this work, we propose to perform noncoherent
DOSTBC-OFDM detection by treating the virtual channel
as if it were physical. Specifically, by directly applying the
noncoherent ML formulation (13) to the DOSTBC-OFDM
model in (17), we obtain the following block-wise noncoherent
ML detector for the destination receiver:
(19)
where we directly estimate the virtual channel and the infor-
mation bits without the need of knowing the number of coop-
erating relays and their randomized transmit vectors . Note
that and are defined in the way as in (8). Since the non-
coherent DOSTBC-OFDM ML detector formulation in (19) is
the same as that of its point-to-point counterpart in (13), the im-
plementation of the former can be handled in exactly the same
way as the latter. In addition, the channel identifiability condi-
tions for the former also directly apply to the latter.
D. Unique Channel Identifiability
A fundamental performance aspect of the noncoherent ML
detector (13) (and (19)) is unique channel identifiability, i.e.,
the conditions under which the noncoherent ML detector (13)
can uniquely identify the unknown channel in the noise-free
situation. The mathematical definition of unique channel iden-
tifiability4 is given below.
Definition 1 (Unique Channel Identifiability) [41]: We say
that the channel is uniquely identifiable if the following
ambiguity condition
(20)
4We should mention here that the channel identifiability definition given in
Definition 1 is different from that defined in [21], [30], [31] for subspace based
blind channel estimation methods. The two definitions can yield quite different
conditions for uniquely identifying the unknown channel, as shown in [41] and
[30] for the flat-fading OSTBC case. In particular, as reported in [30], increasing
the number of receive antennas can improve the channel identifiability for the
subspace based methods; however, the number of receive antennas has no im-
pact on the channel identifiability defined in Definition 1.
holds only when , where [see (10)] in
which (i.e., the pilot bit vectors of and are the
same).
One should notice that, for an OSTBC-OFDM system, unique
identification of also implies unique identification of the un-
known data provided that , ; i.e.,
there is no channel null in the frequency domain.5
The channel identifiability problem has been investigated in
our previous work [7], in which a mild assumption is made on
. The result is as follows:
Theorem 1 (One-Pilot-Code Scheme [7]): Assume
, and that
A1) is Gaussian distributed and at least one column of
has a positive definite covariance matrix (e.g., spatially and
temporally i.i.d. Gaussian channel).
For the noncoherent ML detector (13), the channel is
uniquely identifiable with probability one if one of the subcar-
riers is dedicated to transmitting pilots only; e.g., .
Theorem 1 shows that the one-pilot-code scheme, which
simply assigns one pilot space-time code at one subcarrier, is
powerful—it uses fairly few pilots to achieve unique identifica-
tion of , in an almost sure sense. However, the result is under
the premise of A1) which implies that the coefficients of
have to be rich enough in randomness. While A1) is a common
assumption in the literature of space-time-frequency coding
[42], there are cases where A1) is not satisfied. One example
is temporally sparse channels, which arise from environments
where the channel is constituted by a few or several multipaths.
In that case we are expected to see many zero coefficients in
, and none of the columns of may satisfy A1). Another
example where A1) may not apply is the DOSTBC-OFDM
scenario. In this scenario, unique identifiability of the virtual
channel is our concern. It can be shown that
for the case of , where is a tall matrix, does not
satisfy A1) inherently.
III. PERFECT CHANNEL IDENTIFIABILITY
The above issues motivate us to consider a stronger channel
identifiability condition, called PCI. The definition of PCI will
be given in the first subsection. To provide some insights, a
simple way of achieving PCI will also be introduced. In the
second subsection, we will establish a new PCI-achieving
scheme that consumes fewer pilots than the simple scheme.
A. Definition of PCI
PCI is defined as follows:
Definition 2 (PCI): We say that an OSTBC-OFDM scheme,
characterized by the pilot placement and the code func-
tions , , achieves PCI if is uniquely iden-
tifiable for any , .
PCI is stronger than probability-one channel identifiability
we employed in Theorem 1—the former guarantees unique
channel identification for any nonzero , without requiring
any statistical assumption. Therefore, for temporally sparse
channels, or perhaps even for non-Gaussian channels, a
5The reason is that, for an OSTBC , the code difference
has full column rank for any . Hence, when the channel is
uniquely identified (i.e., ) and , (20) holds only if .

TABLE I
COMPARISON OF THE PROPOSED PCI ACHIEVING SCHEME WITH SOME EXISTING SCHEMES
in [41] that an NIS-OSTBC must satisfy and cannot
have full rate.
We now consider constructing an OSTBC-OFDM scheme,
based on NIS-OSTBCs:
Given a pilot assignment index set , an
NIS-OSTBC assignment index set , an
NIS-OSTBC function , and an arbitrary OSTBC
function whose matrix dimension is the same as that
of , do the following code assignment:
(27)
(28)
For the pilot placement, assign, for each , a pilot bit
to .
The idea of the scheme above is to have part of the subcarriers
employing NIS-OSTBCs, and the others ordinary OSTBCs. For
the QPSK Alamouti example illustrated above, we can use (26)
as the NIS code . As for the ordinary code , it is
logical to choose a maximal code rate OSTBC with the same
dimension as . This can be obtained by concatenating
two Alamouti codes:
(29)
An important question now is how many NIS-OSTBCs
and pilot bits would be required to achieve PCI. Intuitively,
we should use more NIS-OSTBCs and pilot bits to improve
channel identifiability; in fact, a trivial PCI achieving condition
is when all the transmitted codes are NIS-OSTBCs and every
subcarrier has a pilot bit; i.e., . However,
we should minimize the use of pilots and NIS-OSTBCs since
they incur data rate reduction. To address this question, we
make a few assumptions.
A2) .
Assumption A2) means that we employ just pilot bits,
which is the minimal number of pilot bits necessary for PCI,
according to Lemma 1.
A3) if , and if .
Assumption A3) means that the pilot bits are assigned to the
NIS-OSTBC subcarriers, whatever possible. We have the fol-
lowing theorem:
Theorem 2: Under A2)-A3), the OSTBC-OFDM scheme in
(27) and (28) is PCI-achieving if and only if .
The proof of Theorem 2 will be detailed in the next subsec-
tion. Theorem 2 indicates that the minimal number of NIS-OS-
TBCs for achieving PCI is . Concluding, we should set ,
, to maximize the data rate. For convenience, we will
call such a PCI-achieving scheme the -pilot-bit scheme.
A comparison on the data rate/channel identifiability/detec-
tion complexity between the proposed -pilot-bit scheme and
the existing schemes is shown in Table I. One can see from
the table that the proposed -pilot-bit scheme has a higher data
rate (when , even though it achieves the same PCI as
the -pilot-code scheme and LS channel estimation method.
The detection complexity of the proposed -pilot-bit scheme
is higher than the LS channel estimation method, but, as men-
tioned in Section II-B, the noncoherent ML detector (13) can
be efficiently implemented. As we will show in the simulation
section, the proposed -pilot-bit scheme can exhibit a better bit
error performance than the LS channel estimation method.
C. Proof of Theorem 2
We prove Theorem 2 in this subsection. For ease of exposi-
tion, we will assume ; this is without loss of
generality, as one may verify from the following proof. First,
suppose that . Our aim is to show that the proposed
scheme achieves PCI under such circumstances. Recall from our
previous unique identifiability definitions that PCI is achieved
if the ambiguity condition
(30)
never holds for any , ,
. Under A3) and , we have ;
i.e., the pilot-bit-embedded subcarriers also bear NIS-OSTBCs.
Let us consider the ambiguity condition corresponding to those
subcarriers, or the first of (30):
(31)
By the NIS-OSTBC property in Property 1 and by the pilot bit
constraints , , each equation in (31)
holds only when i) , or when ii) .
For case ii), it can be easily verified that must
hold. Subsequently, we have the following set of equations:
(32)
However, we notice by using the same argument as in (22) that
(32) are all satisfied only when . In other words, the am-
biguity condition (30) is violated whenever
CHANG et al.: NONCOHERENT OSTBC-OFDM FOR MIMO AND COOPERATIVE COMMUNICATIONS 4857
Theorem 3: Suppose that the channel follows the Kro-
necker Gaussian model in (40), with the temporal covariance
matrix satisfying
A4) for all .
Also, suppose that the OSTBC-OFDM scheme is PCI-
achieving. Then
(43)
that is, the achievable diversity order of the noncoherent ML
detector (38) is .
The proof is presented in Appendix B. Theorem 3 indi-
cates an important result—channel identifiability has a direct
impact on the achievable diversity order. Specifically, by
employing a PCI-achieving scheme, the full spatial diversity
is attained noncoherently. Since this achievable noncoherent
diversity order is the same as the diversity order of a co-
herent OSTBC-OFDM scheme [32], Theorem 3 implies that
PCI-achieving schemes achieve the maximal possible diversity
order offered by the system. Simulation results presented in
Section V will also show that the one-pilot-code scheme in [7],
which is not PCI-achieving, may not achieve the same diversity
performance as the PCI-achieving schemes. Some additional
discussions regarding Theorem 3 are in order.
1. The purpose of A4) in Theorem 3 is to ensure a non-
trivial diversity result. Physically, A4) means that there is
no channel null at any subcarrier. If channel nulls exist,
then there is always detection error with the nulled subcar-
riers and it can be verified from the noncoherent diversity
definition that must be zero.
2. Like coherent OSTBC-OFDM, the noncoherent
PCI-achieving OSTBC-OFDM scheme achieves the
full spatial diversity, but not the frequency diversity intro-
duced by multipaths. In the coherent scenario, it is known
that frequency diversity can be harvested by coding across
subcarriers, e.g., by repetition coding [44] or by channel
coding [45]. It is not difficult to see from the proof of
Theorem 3 that the full spatial-frequency diversity can at
least be obtained by repetition coding. The aspect of effi-
cient across-subcarrier coding in the noncoherent context
is beyond the scope of the present paper, but is worthwhile
to investigate as a future work.
B. Achievable Noncoherent Diversity of DOSTBC-OFDM
The achievable noncoherent diversity order in the relay-based
DOSTBC-OFDM scenario in Section II-C can be derived by
using the analysis result established in the previous subsection.
In this scenario, we assume once again, and that the
physical channel follows a complex Gaussian distribution
where we recall , with
denoting the time-domain channel impulse response vector be-
tween the relay to the receiver, and denotes the
temporal correlation matrix. Since the relays are spatially dis-
tributed, it is reasonable to assume . From (18), the
virtual channel is expressed as
(44)
Hence, given the relays-generated randomization matrix ,
follows a distribution
(45)
Applying Theorem 3 gives rise to the following result:
Theorem 4: Consider the DOSTBC-OFDM signal model
in (15) and the noncoherent ML detector in (19). Assume that
, and A4) holds. Moreover, as-
sume that the random matrix has rank equal to with prob-
ability one. Then, for a PCI-achieving scheme, the noncoherent
ML detector achieves .
Proof: Under the assumption that with prob-
ability one, we have that
transmitted
where denotes the probability density function of
. By Theorem 3 and by (45), we see that given any
rank- , the achievable diversity order associated with
the conditioned PEP is
. It follows that the diversity
order associated with transmitted is
.
Suppose that has full rank with probability one, i.e.,
with probability one; note that
several existing randomization strategies, e.g., the Gaussian
randomization [26], satisfies this condition. Then, according to
Theorem 4, the PCI-achieving scheme can achieve a diversity
order , which is also the maximum cooperative
diversity order achievable for its coherent counterpart [24],
[26].
V. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, we present some simulation results to examine
the performance of the proposed -pilot-bit scheme. The perfor-
mance comparison results of point-to-point OSTBC-OFDM are
presented in the first subsection, and that of DOSTBC-OFDM
are presented in the second subsection.
A. Performance Comparison Results of Centralized
OSTBC-OFDM
In the simulations, we consider a QPSK OSTBC-OFDM
system as described in Section II with the DFT size equal to

and independent of each other. Two kinds of temporal profiles
of are considered:
• Channel model I (temporally i.i.d. channel model): Ele-
ments of each are i.i.d. complex Gaussian distributed
with zero mean and unit variance; i.e.,
for all .
• Channel model II (temporally sparse channel model):
contains some deterministic zero coefficients.
The remaining non-zero coefficients are i.i.d. complex
Gaussian distributed with zero mean and unit variance. For
example, suppose that the channel order of is equal

VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have analyzed the unique channel iden-
tifiability conditions and achievable diversity order of the
block-wise noncoherentML detector, for both the point-to-point
OSTBC-OFDM and relay-based DOSTBC-OFDM systems.
By employing the NIS-OSTBCs and by a judicious placement
of pilot bits, we have constructed a pilot-efficient -pilot-bit
scheme that achieves the powerful PCI. We have also shown
that PCI-achieving schemes can achieve the maximum nonco-
herent spatial diversity order in point-to-point OSTBC-OFDM
as well as the maximum noncoherent cooperative diversity
order in DOSTBC-OFDM. The presented simulation results
have demonstrated that the proposed -pilot-bit scheme, in ei-
ther i.i.d., sparse, or dispersive multipath channels, outperforms
the existing methods and exhibits consistent BER performance
with our theoretical claims.
Our study of noncoherent OSTBC-OFDM for cooperative
communications has been emphasizing the decode-and-forward
strategy, wherein we focus on harvesting the noncoherent di-
versity offered by the relays-to-destination link. As a future di-
rection, it would be interesting to consider the alternative re-
laying strategy of amplify-and-forward (AF), e.g., [46]. In the
coherent scenario, it has been shown that both the source-to-re-
lays and relays-to-destination links in AF can be exploited to
enhance the diversity order. Hence, an open question is whether
we may achieve the same diversity performance in the nonco-
herent scenario, and if yes, how we may design the OSTBC-
OFDM scheme to attain that.

PROOF OF (41)
For notational simplicity, we use and to represent the

shown [7] that (38) can be reformulated as the following BQP:

PROOF OF THEOREM 3
Similar to the proof in Appendix A, we use and to rep-
resent the two distinct codewords and , respectively.
Thus in (41) can be expressed as

Let and , and let
(A6)
be the eigenvalue decompositions of and , respectively,
where and are semi-unitary ma-
trices, and and are (full rank) di-
agonal matrices with the positive eigenvalues of and
being the diagonal elements, respectively. Let
and be two arbitrary unitary matrices. Then it fol-
lows from (A6) that
(A7)
are square roots of and , respectively, satisfying
and . We thus have the chain in
(A8) and (A9), shown at the bottom of the page, where the
equality in (A8) is owing to the definition of in (A5), and
the last equality is due to the fact that is
of full rank. Moreover, since , and are all
semi-unitary matrices, we have
(A10)
which implies that the maximum eigenvalue value of
in (A9) is no larger
than one. Therefore, determining the rank value in (A9) is
equivalent to determining the number of singular values of
that are strictly less than one. Let be
the number of singular values of that are
equal to one. It follows from (A9) and (A9) that

To determine the value of , we need the following lemma:

semi-unitary matrices. The matrix has
singular values equal to one if and only if
there exist two linearly independent sets

Fig. 1. System model of a two-way OFDM relay channel, consisting of (a) a multiple-access phase and (b) a broadcast phase.
This paper focuses on the two-way OFDM relay channel
with a negligible direct link due to large path attenuation
or heavy blockage. This is motivated by the fact that the
relay node plays a more important role when the direct link
is weak than when it is strong [13]. The optimal two-way
relay strategy in this case consists of two phases, which
are illustrated in Fig. 1. We intend to answer the following
questions in this paper: What is the optimal DF relay strategy
when the direct link is negligible? Under what conditions is
the optimal DF relay strategy better than the AF relay strategy,
and vice versa? Is the optimal DF relay strategy able to
achieve the capacity region of two-way OFDM relay channels
in some special scenarios? To address these questions, we
first introduce a multi-subcarrier DF relay strategy, which
outperforms the existing per-subcarrier DF relay strategy in
terms of both achievable rate region and resource allocation
algorithm complexity. Then, we provide a performance com-
parison between this multi-subcarrier DF relay strategy and
the AF relay strategy. The main contributions of this paper
are summarized as follows:
• We present a multi-subcarrier DF relay strategy, which
has a larger achievable rate region than the widely stud-
ied per-subcarrier DF relay strategy. Though this multi-
subcarrier DF relay strategy is merely a simple extension
of the existing result [7], it is the optimal DF relay
strategy for two-way OFDM relay channels.1 To the best
of our knowledge, this multi-subcarrier DF relay strategy
has not been reported in the open literature. We develop
an optimal resource allocation algorithm to characterize
the achievable rate region of the multi-subcarrier DF relay
strategy. We show that the optimal resource allocation
solution has a low-dimension structure. By exploiting
this structure, the complexity of both primal and dual
optimizations can be significantly reduced. The relative
benefits of our multi-subcarrier DF relay strategy and its
resource allocation algorithm are summarized in Table I.
• We analyze the asymptotic performance of different relay
strategies in the low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
regimes under optimal resource allocation. First, we
show that the multi-subcarrier DF relay strategy tends
to achieve the capacity region of two-way OFDM relay
channels in the low SNR regime. Then, we characterize
1The optimal DF relay strategy here means that its achievable rate region
contains the rate region of any other DF relay strategy. It is worth mentioning
that relay strategies other than DF relay strategies may have a larger or smaller
achievable rate region compared to this multi-subcarrier DF relay strategy in
certain scenarios.

in Section VI. Finally, Section VII draws some conclusions.

II. SYSTEM MODEL
We consider a two-way OFDM relay channel with N
subcarriers, where two terminal nodes T1 and T2 exchange
messages by virtue of an intermediate relay node TR. The
wireless transmissions in the two-way DF relay channel is
composed of two phases: a multiple-access phase and a

The only difference between RDF(P ,G) and Rp,DF(P ,G) lies
in the order of the function min{·} and the summation in (5)
and (6), implying Rp,DF(P ,G) ⊆ RDF(P ,G). Therefore, the
per-subcarrier DF relay strategy is only a suboptimal DF relay
strategy. Similar results have been reported in [26], [27] for
one-way parallel relay channels.
We now provide a toy example to compare these two DF
relay strategies. Consider a two-way OFDM relay channel
with N = 2 subcarriers. The wireless channel power gains are
given by (g11, g12, g21, g22) = (1, 15, 7, 3) and g˜in = gin for
n, i ∈ {1, 2}. The power and channel resources are fixed to be
pin = 0.5 and t = 0.5. According to Lemma 1, the achievable
rate region of the multi-subcarrier DF relay strategy with fixed
resource allocation is given by the set of rate pairs (R12, R21)
satisfying
R12≤min{0.5 + 2, 1.5 + 1} = 2.5 bits/s/Hz, (7a)
R21≤min{1.5 + 1, 0.5 + 2} = 2.5 bits/s/Hz, (7b)
R12 +R21≤0.5 [log2(9) + log2(19)] = 3.71 bits/s/Hz. (7c)
Similarly, by (6), the achievable rate region of the per-
subcarrier DF relay strategy with fixed resource allocation is
given by the set of rate pairs (R12, R21) satisfying
R12≤min{0.5, 1.5}+min{2, 1} = 1.5 bits/s/Hz, (8a)
R21≤min{1.5, 0.5}+min{1, 2} = 1.5 bits/s/Hz, (8b)
R12 +R21≤0.5 [log2(9) + log2(19)] = 3.71 bits/s/Hz, (8c)
where the sum-rate constraint is actually inactive. By com-
paring (7) and (8), one can easily observe that the considered
multi-subcarrier DF relay strategy has a larger achievable rate
region. An effective and computationally efficient approach
for the optimal resource allocation of the proposed two-way
DF strategy will be presented in the next section.
IV. RESOURCE ALLOCATION ALGORITHM
We now develop a resource allocation algorithm to charac-
terize the boundary of the achievable rate region RDF(P ,G) in
(5). We will show that the optimal resource allocation solution
has a low-dimension structure, and thereby the number of dual
variables to be optimized is reduced; see Propositions 1 and
2 below for more details. The complexity of our resource
allocation algorithm turns out to be much lower than that of
the standard Lagrangian dual optimization algorithm and the
existing resource allocation algorithm reported in [17].
A. Resource Allocation Problem Formulation
Let ρ ∈ (0,∞) denote the rate ratio of the two terminal
nodes, i.e.,
ρ  R21/R12. (9)
Then, a boundary point (R12, R21) = (R12, ρR12) of the
achievable rate region RDF(P ,G) is attained by maximizing
R12 within RDF(P ,G) for a given rate ratio ρ. Therefore, the
boundary point of RDF(P ,G) is characterized by the following
resource allocation problem:

where pi  (pi1, pi2, . . . , piN )∈RN+ denotes the power allo-
cation of node Ti for i=1, 2, R. Problem (10) is a convex opti-
mization problem, which can be solved by standard interior-
point methods or by using general purpose convex solvers
such as CVX [28]. However, these methods quickly become
computationally formidable as the number of subcarriers N
increases, because their complexity grows in the order of
O(N3.5) [29], [30, p. 8 and Eq. (11.29)]. Since N can be
quite large in practical OFDM systems, we will develop a
more efficient resource allocation algorithm for large values
of N in the sequel.
B. Phase-Wise Decomposition of Problem (10)
Let us first fix the value of t. Then, problem (10) can be
decomposed into two power allocation subproblems for the
multi-access phase and the broadcast phase, respectively. Note
that the transmission powers of the terminal nodes p1 and p2
are only involved in the rate constraints (10b)-(10d) for the
multiple-access phase, while the transmission power of the
relay node pR is only involved in the rate constraints (10e)
and (10f) for the broadcast phase. Let RMA and RBC denote the
achievable rates for the multiple-access and broadcast phases,
respectively. For any fixed t, problem (10) can be decomposed
into the following two subproblems, one for the multiple-
access phase
RMA(t) max
p1,p20,RMA
RMA (11a)
s.t. RMA ≤ rk(p1,p2), k = 1, 2, 3, (11b)

where the rate functions rk(p1,p2), k = 1, 2, 3, and
rk(pR), k = 4, 5, are defined by
HE et al.: CAPACITY REGION BOUNDS AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION FOR TWO-WAY OFDM RELAY CHANNELS 2909
Case 4: p1n = 0, p2n = 0. This is the default case when
the above 3 cases do not happen.
Remark 1 If the structural property of λ in Proposition 1
is not available, one can still obtain an alternative closed-
form solution to (19) [1]. However, this solution involves
solving a more difficult cubic equation, which is presented
in Appendix C. Nevertheless, these two closed-form solutions
are much simpler than the iterative power allocation procedure
proposed in [17] for the per-subcarrier DF relay strategy.
Remark 2 Since the Lagrangian (16) is not strictly convex
with respect to the primal power variables at some dual points,
the power allocation solution in (20)-(23) may be non-unique
at those dual points. Nevertheless, any one of the optimal
primal power solutions can be used to derive the subgradient
for solving the dual problem (17) [32, Section 6.1]. After the
optimal dual point (λ,α) is obtained, extra processing may
be needed to obtain the optimal primal solutions to (11) by
using the KKT conditions [32]–[34]. More details are given
in our online technical report [35] due to space limit.
3) Dual Solution to Problem (17): We now solve the dual
problem (17) by a two-level optimization approach [17], which
first fixes λ and searches for the optimal solution α(λ) to
the maximization problem
GMA(λ)  max
α0
DMA(λ,α), (24)
and then optimizes λ by
λ  argmax
λ0
GMA(λ). (25)
The inner-level optimization problem (24) is solved by an
ellipsoid method [36] summarized in Algorithm 1, where the
subgradient of the dual problem DMA(λ,α) with respect to
α is given by [32, Proposition 6.1.1]
η(λ,α) =
(
N∑
n=1
p1n − P1,
N∑
n=1
p2n − P2
)
, (26)
where (p1n, p2n) is the optimal power allocation solution
obtained by (20)-(23). More details about the initialization of
α and the matrix A in Algorithm 1 are given in [35].
By Proposition 1, the outer-level optimization problem (25)
can be solved by searching for λ over the set Λ1
⋃
Λ2, i.e.,
λ = arg max
λ∈Λ1
⋃
Λ2
GMA(λ). (27)
In order to solve the reduced outer-level optimization
problem (27), we first need the subgradient of the objective
function GMA(λ). According to [32] and [37, Corollary 4.5.3],
one subgradient of GMA(λ) in (24) is given by
ξ(λ) = (RMA − r1, RMA − r2, RMA − r3) , (28)
where RMA=min{r1, r2, r3}, and rk (k=1, 2, 3) are the rate
functions (13a)-(13c) associated with the optimal primal
power allocation solution (20)-(23) obtained at the dual point
(λ,α(λ)), respectively, and α(λ) is the optimal solution to
(24).
With the subgradient ξ(λ) of GMA(λ), we are ready to
solve the outer-level optimization problem (27). Instead of
searching both the sets Λ1 and Λ2, we propose a simple
testing method to determine whether λ ∈Λ1 or λ ∈Λ2.
Noticing that Λ1
⋂
Λ2= {(0, 0, 1)}, let us consider a testing

problem (24)

method at the dual point λ0 = (0, 0, 1). By the concavity of
the dual function DMA(λ,α), GMA(λ) is also concave in λ,
which implies [32, Eq. (B.21)]
GMA(λ)≤GMA(λ0)+(λ−λ0)T ξ(λ0), ∀ λ∈Λ1
⋃
Λ2. (29)
Suppose that λ is an optimal solution to (27), i.e.,
GMA(λ
) ≥ GMA(λ0). Then, by (29), we must have
(λ − λ0)T ξ(λ0) ≥ 0 (30)
for the optimal dual point λ. In other words, if a dual point
λ satisfies (λ−λ0)T ξ(λ0)< 0, then λ cannot be an optimal
solution to problem (27). Due to this and (28), we establish
the following proposition:
Proposition 2 Let rk (k=1, 2, 3) denote the values of the
terms used in the subgradient ξ(λ) in (28) with λ = λ0.
If r3 ≥ r1, then λ ∈Λ1. If r3 ≥ r2, then λ ∈Λ2. If both
r3 ≥ r1 and r3 ≥ r2, then λ = λ0 = (0, 0, 1).
Proof: See Appendix D. 
The procedure for solving (27) is given as follows: First,
we utilize the preceding testing method stated in Proposition 2
to determine whether λ ∈Λ1 or λ ∈Λ2. Then, we use the
bisection method to find the optimal dual variable λ. If
λ=(1−λ3, 0, λ3)∈Λ1, the directional subgradient ζ(λ3) of
GMA(λ) along the direction of Λ1 is determined by
ζ(λ3) = ξ(λ)
T ∂λ
∂λ3
= ξ(λ)T (−1, 0, 1) = r1 − r3; (31)
otherwise, if λ = (0, 1 − λ3, λ3)∈Λ2, the directional
subgradient ζ(λ3) along the direction of Λ2 is determined
by
ζ(λ3) = ξ(λ)
T (0,−1, 1) = r2 − r3. (32)
Since GMA(λ) is concave in λ, it is also concave along
the direction of Λ1 (or Λ2). Thus, ζ(λ3) is monotonically
non-increasing with respect to λ3. Therefore, we can use the
bisection method to search for the optimal solution λ3 to (25),
which satisfies ζ(λ3) = 0, if 0 < λ3 < 1; ζ(λ3) ≤ 0, if
λ3 = 0; or ζ(λ

3) ≥ 0, if λ3 = 1. The obtained algorithm for
solving subproblem (11) is summarized in Algorithm 2.

search methods K . Therefore, the computational complexity
of Algorithm 4 is much smaller than that of the resource

V. ASYMPTOTIC PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
In this section, we analyze the asymptotic rate regions
of different relay strategies for two-way OFDM channels,
including both the per-subcarrier and the proposed multi-
subcarrier DF relay strategies, the AF relay strategy, and the
cut-set outer bound, in order to compare their achievable rate
regions in both low and high SNR regimes and their respective
performance merits.
The cut-set outer bound for the capacity region of the two-
way OFDM relay channels (1)-(3) is obtained by removing
the sum-rate constraints in (5), which is given by [7]
Rout(P ,G) =

, (39)
where an = pRnp1ng1n+p2ng2n+1 is the amplification factor of the
relay node in subcarrier n and the time proportion t is fixed
to be 0.5 due to the incompressible nature of the AF relay
strategy.
Suppose that P¯  (P¯1, P¯2, P¯R) is a column vector consti-
tuted by nominal values of P1, P2 and PR. Then the available
transmission powers of the three nodes can be expressed as
P = xP¯ , (40)
where x is a positive scalar variable. Note that the average
SNRs of all the wireless links are proportional to x, and so
we will analyze the achievable rate regions of the two-way
relay strategies under consideration for small x and large x
instead.
A. Low SNR Regime
In the low SNR region (small x), the function log2(1+ax)
with a > 0 can be expressed as
log2(1 + ax) =
a
ln 2
x+O(x2). (41)
Using (41), we can show the following proposition:
Proposition 3 For sufficiently small x> 0 and any
rate pair (R12, R21)∈Rout(xP¯ ,G), there exists some
(Rˆ12, Rˆ21)∈RDF(xP¯ ,G) such that R12 = Rˆ12 + O(x2b)
and R21 = Rˆ21+O(x2b) for b ≥ 1. The regions RDF(xP¯ ,G)
and Rout(xP¯ ,G) tend to be the same as x→ 0.
Therefore, the multi-subcarrier DF relay strategy tends to
achieve the capacity region of two-way OFDM relay channels
(1)-(3) as x→ 0. The proof of Proposition 3 is given in [35]
due to space limit. On the other hand, it can be easily shown
that the achievable rate region of the AF relay strategy will
deflate in a much faster speed than the other two-way strategies
for small x, due to the noise amplification and propagation
effects.
B. High SNR Regime
In the high SNR region (large x), the function log2(1+ax)
with a > 0 satisfies
log2(1 + ax) = log2(ax) +O(1/x) = log2(x) +O(1). (42)
Let us define the multiplexing gain region of the multi-
subcarrier DF relay strategy [39]:
rDF  lim
x→∞
RDF(xP¯ ,G)
log2(x)
. (43)
Using (42), we can prove the following proposition:
Proposition 4 The multiplexing gain region of the multi-
subcarrier DF relay strategy is given by

SNR=0 dB, (b) SNR=10 dB, (c) SNR=20 dB, and (d) SNR=30 dB.
Finally, Figure 6 shows some results (the achievable rate
versus average SNR) of these relay strategies for the symme-
tric SNR symmetric rate scenario, i.e., SNR1=SNR2=SNR
and R12 = R21. The numerical results in Fig. 6 were obtained
by averaging over 500 fading channel realizations. One can
see from this figure that, in the low SNR regime, the multi-
subcarrier DF relay strategy tends to have the same perform-
ance as the cut-set outer bound, and that the multi-subcarrier
DF relay strategy performs better than the AF relay strategy
in the low to moderate SNR regime, i.e., SNR≤ 24 dB. More-
over, the multi-subcarrier DF relay strategy with the optimal
resource allocation performs better than with the equal power
allocation and the optimal t used; it also outperforms the
per-subcarrier DF strategy.
By Proposition 5, in the high SNR regime, the multiplexing
gains of the AF relay strategy and the cut-set outer bound
are the same; the multiplexing gains of the two DF relay
strategies are also the same; the multiplexing gain of the
AF relay strategy is larger than that of the DF relay strategy
(implying better performance for the former than the latter for
sufficiently high SNR); both the equal power allocation and the
optimal power allocation for the multi-subcarrier DF strategy
achieve the same multiplexing gain, and the rate gap between
them tends to a constant value as SNR increases. All these
analytical results have been substantiated by the numerical
results shown in Figures 3-6.
VII. CONCLUSION
We have analytically shown that the widely studied per-
subcarrier DF relay strategy is only a suboptimal DF relay
strategy for two-way OFDM relay channels in terms of achie-
vable rate region when the direct link is negligible. We have
presented a multi-subcarrier DF relay strategy that can achieve
a larger rate region than the per-subcarrier DF relay strat-
egy. We have presented a computationally efficient algorithm
(Algorithm 4) for obtaining the optimal resource allocation of
the proposed multi-subcarrier DF relay strategy. Then we have
presented an analysis of asymptotic performance for the above
two DF strategies, the AF strategy, and the cut-set outer bound.
Our theoretical analysis and numerical results imply that the

of problem (17) that satisfies λˆ = (0, 1−λˆ3, λˆ3). Hence, the
statement of Proposition 1 has been proved for Case 2.
APPENDIX C
CLOSED-FORM SOLUTION TO (19) WITHOUT USING
PROPOSITION 1 (DISCUSSED IN REMARK 1)
When the structural property in Proposition 1 is not avail-
able, the primal power allocation solution is more complicated
for the case of p1n > 0, p2n > 0. In this case, the KKT
conditions (19a) and (19b) both hold with equality. Therefore,
we need to solve a system of quadratic equations with two
variables. To simplify this problem, we define an auxiliary
variable
x  g1np1n + g2np2n. (50)
Then, by (19) and through some derivations, we obtain
p1n =
t(ρ+ 1)λ1
α1(ρ+ 1) ln 2−tg1nλ3/(t+ x) −
t
g1n
, (51a)
p2n =
t(ρ+ 1)λ2/ρ
α2(ρ+ 1) ln 2−tg2nλ3/(t+ x) −
t
g2n
. (51b)
By substituting (51a) and (51b) into (50), we end up with
the following cubic equation of x:
tg1n(ρ+ 1)λ1
α1(ρ+ 1) ln 2− tg1nλ3t+x
+
tg2n(ρ+ 1)λ2/ρ
α2(ρ+ 1) ln 2− tg2nλ3t+x
= x+ 2t.
(52)
It is widely known that the closed-form solutions of the
cubic equation x3+ ax2+ bx+ c = 0 are given by Cardano’s
formula [40], i.e.,

Δ, θ1 = angle (y1), θ2 = angle (y2) , and angle (·) denotes
the phase angle of an complex number. If Δ ≥ 0, the cubic
equation has one real root and a pair of conjugate complex
roots; if Δ < 0, the cubic equation has three real roots.

where γi > 0 is the target SINR value for receiver i. To this
end, the transmitter requires the receivers’ CSI, i.e., {hi}
K
i=1.
Suppose that the transmitter perfectly knows {hi}
K
i=1. A set
of optimum beamforming vectors can be obtained by solving
the following optimization problem

where || · || denotes the vector 2-norm. As seen in (3), our
task is to find a most power-efficient design that guarantees
the desired SINR specifications in (2). It has been shown
in [1] and [8] that problem (3) can be reformulated as a con-
vex second-order cone program (SOCP). Therefore, efficient
solvers, such as CVX [9], can be employed to solve problem
(3).
2.2 Probabilistically-Constrained Robust Design
In wireless systems, CSI at the transmitter is either es-
timated via uplink training (e.g., in time division duplex
systems) or acquired through receivers’ feedback (e.g., in
frequency division duplex systems). Hence it is inevitable
to have CSI errors in practice due to finite-length train-
ing data or due to limited quantization feedback [1]. Let
h¯i, i = 1, . . . , K, denote the obtained channel estimates at
the transmitter. The true channel vectors {hi}
K
i=1 can be
modeled as
hi = h¯i + ei, i = 1, . . . , K, (4)
where ei ∈ C
Nt represents the channel error. With the im-
perfect CSI {h¯i}
K
i=1, the standard transmit beamforming de-
sign in (3) may no longer guarantee the desired SINR spec-
ifications [in (2)] all the time, and therefore SINR outage
may occur. This issue motivates the investigation of robust
transmit beamforming design.
In this paper, we consider the stochastic robust trans-
mit beamforming design. Specifically, we model each ei as
an i.i.d. complex Gaussian random vector, with zero mean
and covariance matrix 2i INt , i.e., ei ∼ CN (0, 
2
i INt). This
model is particularly suitable for errors owing to imperfect
channel estimation. Under this stochastic model, it is de-
sirable to have a beamforming design that is able to guar-
antee the SINR specifications in (2) with a high satisfaction
probability, or, equivalently, a low SINR outage probabil-
ity. Let ρi ∈ (0, 1] denotes the maximum tolerable SINR
outage probability for receiver i. We consider the following
probabilistically-constrained design formulation [4]

Problem (5) aims to find a most power-efficient beamforming
design that guarantees receiver i a (1−ρi) SINR satisfaction
probability, for i = 1, . . . ,K. Solving problem (5) is a chal-
lenging task because the probabilistic SINR constraints in
(5b) are intractable and are not convex in general. In the
next section, we present a conservative approach to approx-
imating problem (5).
3. PROPOSED CONSERVATIVE APPROACH
In this section, the proposed conservative approach is pre-
sented. In the first subsection, a conservative formulation
of problem (5) is given. In the second subsection, an SDR
based method is presented to handle the proposed conser-
vative formulation. A bisection technique that can further
enhance the proposed conservative approach is presented in
the last subsection.
3.1 Proposed Conservative Formulation
To present the proposed approach, let us write
ei = ivi (6)
where vi ∼ CN (0, INt), and rewrite the probabilistic SINR
constraints in (5b) as
Pr
(
|(h¯i + ivi)
H
wi|
2∑K
k 6=i |(h¯i + ivi)
Hwk|2 + σ2i

)
≥ 1− ρi (7)
for i = 1, . . . ,K. The proposed conservation approach is
based on the following simple lemma:
Lemma 1 Let v ∈ CNt be a continuous random vector fol-
lowing certain statistical distribution and let G(v) : CNt →
R be a function of v. Let r > 0 be the radius of the ball
{v| ‖v‖2 ≤ r2} such that Pr(‖v‖2 ≤ r2) ≥ 1 − ρ where
ρ ∈ (0, 1]. Then
G(v) ≥ 0 ∀ ‖v‖2 ≤ r2 (8)
implies Pr (G(v) ≥ 0) ≥ 1− ρ.
Proof: Let f(v) denote the probability density function
of v. Suppose that (8) holds. We have that
Pr (G(v) ≥ 0) =
∫
G(v)≥0
f(v) dv ≥
∫
‖v‖2≤r2
f(v) dv
= Pr
(
‖v‖2 ≤ r2
)
≥ 1− ρ, (9)
where the first inequality follows from (8). The lemma then
is proved. 
By applying Lemma 1 to (7), we can see that (7) is sat-
isfied whenever

us to iteratively update ri in a bisection manner such that
the level of conservatism can be reduced.
To illustrate this method, let us assume that all the re-
ceivers have the same SINR outage probability, i.e., ρ ,
ρ1 = · · · = ρK and thus we can let r , r1 = · · · = rK .
In each iteration, we first solve problem (12) with a given
r to obtain the associated optimum beamformers, denoted
by {w?i }
K
i=1. Given {w
?
i }
K
i=1, one can apply the statistical
validation procedure in [12] to determine whether the prob-
abilistic SINR constraints in (5b) are (empirically) met or
not. If yes, it means that there may exist room for further
reducing r; otherwise one should increase r. Hence depend-
ing on the outcome of the validation procedure, the radius
r can be updated in a bisection manner over the interval of
(0,
√
ICDF(1− ρ)/2]. In Table 1, we summarize the bisec-
tion procedure.
It should be mentioned that the above bisection proce-
dure also applies to the conservative approaches presented
in [4] where a different parameter that controls the level of
conservatism can be iteratively updated via bisection; read-
ers are referred to [4] for the details. As will be shown in the
next section, the proposed new conservative approach (with
bisection) can exhibit better performance than the methods
in [4].
4. SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
In this section, we present some simulation results to demon-
strate the effectiveness of the proposed conservative ap-
proach. In the simulations, we consider a wireless system
as described in Sec. 2 with the transmitter equipped with
3 antennas (Nt = 3) and 3 receivers (K = 3). The channel
estimates {h¯i}
3
i=1 are randomly generated according to i.i.d.
complex Gaussian with zero mean and unit variance (i.e.,
h¯i ∼ CN (0, I3)). As mentioned in Sec. 2.2, the error vectors
{ei}
3
i=1 are modeled as i.i.d. zero-mean complex Gaussian.
For simplicity, all the entries of ei have identical variance
of 0.002 (i.e., 21 = 
2
2 = 
2
3 = 0.002). The noise powers
at receivers are also set the same: σ21 = σ
2
2 = σ
2
3 = 0.01.
We assume that all the 3 receivers demand the same QoS
requirement. In particular, the receivers’ target SINR val-
ues {γi}
3
i=1 are set the same, i.e., γ , γ1 = γ2 = γ3, and
the SINR outage probabilities {ρi}
3
i=1 are all set as 0.1, i.e.,
ρ , ρ1 = ρ2 = ρ3 = 0.1, which means that a 90% SINR satis-
faction probability is desired. We applied the SDR technique
in Sec. 3.2 to handle the proposed conservative formulation
in (12) using the sphere radius r given in (11), which is la-
beled as ‘Proposed method’. The SDP solver CVX [9] was
used to solve problem (16). The bisection procedure in Table
1 was also tested (labeled as ‘Proposed method with bisec-
tion’) with the solution accuracy ε set as 10−3 (ε = 10−3).
To implement the statistical validation procedure in [12], we
generated 92,103 sets of error vectors {ei}
3
i=1 for each realiza-
tion of {h¯i}
3
i=1, to test whether the probabilistic SINR con-
straints in (5b) are satisfied empirically. According to [12],
this validation procedure has 99% confidence that the ob-
tained empirical probability is correct. We compare the pro-
posed conservative approach with the conservative formula-
tion I proposed in [4] (labeled as ‘Formulation I in [4]’). The
method in [4] also admits a bisection procedure to reduce its
level of conservatism. This procedure was also tested which
is labeled as ‘Formulation I in [4] with bisection’.
In the first example, we compare the feasibility rates of
the proposed method and Formulation I in [4]. We gener-
ate 500 realizations of {h¯i}
3
i=1, and, for each realization, we
determine if the formulation under test is able to yield a
solution {wi}
3
i=1 that has a finite power and satisfies the
probabilistic SINR constraints in (5b) (which is verified by
the statistical validation procedure in [12]). Figure 1 displays
Table 1. Bisection procedure for the proposed conservative
formulation (12).
Given a desired SINR outage probability ρ ∈ (0, 1], and a
solution accuracy ε > 0.
Set rmin = 0 and rmax =
√
ICDF(1− ρ)/2.
Step 1. Solve problem (12) with r = (rmax+rmin)/2 using the
SDR technique in Section 3.2.
Step 2. If (12) is feasible, let {w?i }
K
i=1 be the associated opti-
mum solution, and go to Step 3; otherwise set rmax = r
and go to Step 1.
Step 3. Apply the statistical validation procedure in [12] to
determine whether {w?i }
K
i=1 satisfies the probabilistic
SINR constraints in (5b). Let rmax = r if (5b) is
satisfied; otherwise set rmin = r.

the simulation results of the feasibility rate (%) versus the
target SINR γ (dB). As observed from this figure, the pro-
posed method exhibits a much higher feasibility rate than
Formulation I in [4] under the same γ. For example, for
γ = 17 dB, the proposed method has around 30% feasibility
rate; whereas Formulation I in [4] is hardly feasible. One
can also see from this figure that the feasibility rates of both
methods can be considerably increased when their respec-
tive bisection techniques are applied; however the proposed
method (with bisection) still shows better performance.
To look further into the levels of conservatism of the pro-
posed method and Formulation I in [4], we display in Fig. 2
the distribution (%) of the empirical SINR satisfaction prob-
ability of receiver 1 (i = 1). Note that only the realizations
of {h¯i}
3
i=1 for which the proposed method and Formulation
I in [4] are both feasible are taken into account. Figures 2(a)
and 2(b) show the results of the two methods (without bi-
section) for γ = 13 dB, respectively. One can see from the
two figures that both methods are over conservative since
the empirical satisfaction probabilities are much higher than
the required probability 0.9. However, we can observe that
the proposed method is slightly less conservative than For-
mulation I in [4]. Figures 2(c) to 2(f) display the results of
the two methods with the bisection techniques applied. One
can see that the levels of conservatism of both methods with
bisection can be significantly reduced, while the proposed
method with bisection is less conservative in a worst-case
sense. For example, the maximum achieved SINR satisfac-
tion probability in Fig. 2(e) is less than 0.965, whereas it is
more than 0.985 in Fig. 2(f).
In the last example, we examine the required average
transmission powers of the proposed method and the meth-
ods in [4]. To this end, we generate 500 realizations of
{h¯i}
3
i=1, and select the realizations for which the proposed
method, Formulation I in [4] and their bisection counterparts
are all able to satisfy the probabilistic SINR constraints in
(5b) for γ = 9 dB. We obtain 201 such realizations of {h¯i}
3
i=1
and use them to test the four methods for various values of
target SINR γ. The average transmission power of each of
the four methods is calculated over these 201 realizations,
and are plotted in Fig. 3. Note that we set the average
transmission power as infinity if there exist at least one real-
ization of {h¯i}
3
i=1 such that the method under test is infea-
sible. It can be seen from the figure that both the proposed
method and the proposed method with bisection are more
power efficient than the methods proposed in [4], and are
able to support a wider range of target SINR values.
In summary, we have presented a new conservative ap-410

ABSTRACT
This paper considers weighted sum rate maximization of multiuser
multiple-input single-output interference channel (MISO-IFC) un-
der outage constraints. The outage-constrained weighted sum rate
maximization problem is a nonconvex optimization problem and is
difficult to solve. While it is possible to optimally deal with this
problem in an exhaustive search manner by finding all the Pareto-
optimal rate tuples in the (discretized) outage-constrained achiev-
able rate region, this approach, however, suffers from a prohibitive
computational complexity and is feasible only when the number of
transmitter-receive pairs is small. In this paper, we propose a convex
optimization based approximation method for efficiently handling
the outage-constrained weighted sum rate maximization problem.
The proposed approximation method consists of solving a sequence
of convex optimization problems, and thus can be efficiently imple-
mented by interior-point methods. Simulation results show that the
proposed method can yield near-optimal solutions.

1. INTRODUCTION
Recently, interference management for improving spectral efficiency
of wireless multiuser systems has been a research topic drawing
significant attention [1]. This paper considers the K-user multiple-
input single-output interference channel (MISO-IFC) where K
multi-antenna transmitters simultaneously communicate withK re-
spective single-antenna receivers over a common frequency band.
This MISO-IFC arises, for example, in multicell wireless systems
where each of the base stations is equipped with multiple antennas
and each mobile station has only one antenna. Under the assumption
that the transmitters have the perfect channel state information, and
that the receivers employ single-user detection, it has been shown
that transmit beamforming is an optimal transmission scheme to
attain the Pareto boundary of the achievable rate region of MISO-
IFC [2]. The structure of the Pareto-optimal beamforming schemes
has also been studied in [3, 4]. A game-theoretic approach for
MISO-IFC has been presented in [5].
This paper assumes that the channel coefficients are block-faded,
and that the transmitters know only the statistical distribution of the
channels. Specifically, each channel is assumed to be circularly
symmetric complex Gaussian distributed, with a covariance matrix
known to the transmitters. Under limited delay constraints and due

E-007-052-MY3 and NSC99-2221-E-007-089-MY3.
to channel fading, the receivers’ performance may suffer from out-
age. Assuming that the transmitters employ transmit beamforming,
the achievable rate region of MISO-IFC under outage constraints
on receivers’ performance has been investigated in [6]. While this
outage-constrained achievable rate region is not known analytically
so far, it has been shown that this region can be found numerically
using an exhaustive search method [6]. This method, unfortunately,
has a complexity that increases exponentially with K(K − 1), and
therefore is not feasible in practice.
In this paper, we investigate efficient approaches to achieving
Pareto-optimal beamforming solutions that maximize the achievable
weighted sum rate. To this end, we study the design formulation that
maximizes the weighted sum rate subject to outage constraints and
individual power constraints. Due to the nonconvextity of the out-
age constraints, solving the weighted sum rate maximization prob-
lem is a challenging task. To efficiently deal with this problem, we
propose a sequential convex approximation method. The proposed
approximation method is conservative in the sense that the obtained
approximate beamforming solutions are guaranteed to be feasible
and satisfy the outage constraints of the original problem. Since the
proposed method only involves solving convex optimization prob-
lems, it can be efficiently implemented by interior-point methods in
a polynomial-time complexity [7]. The presented simulation results
show that the proposed approximation method can provide near-
optimal performance and outperform the existing maximum-ratio
and zero-forcing transmission strategies.
2. SIGNALMODEL AND PROBLEM STATEMENT
We consider the K-user MISO interference channel where each of
the transmitters has Nt antennas and all the receivers are equipped
with a single antenna. All the transmitters employ transmit beam-
forming to transmit information signals to their respective receivers.
Let si(t) denote the information signal sent from transmitter i, and
let wi ∈ CNt be the associated beamforming vector. The received
signal at receiver i is given by
xi(t) = h
H
iiwisi(t) +
K∑
k=1,k =i
h
H
kiwksk(t) + ni(t), (1)
where hki ∈ CNt denotes the channel vector from transmitter k
to receiver i, and ni(t) is the additive noise of receiver i. The
noise ni(t) is assumed to be complex Gaussian distributed with zero
mean and variance σ2i > 0, i.e., ni(t) ∼ CN (0, σ2i ). Assuming
that si(t) ∼ CN (0, 1) and that the receivers decode the informa-
tion message using single-user detection (which treats the cross-

where Kci  {1, . . . ,K}\{i}, and (7h) is due to (6c). Notice that
we have replaced the equalities in (6a) and (6b) with inequalities as
in (7c) to (7f). It is not difficult to verify that all the inequalities in
(7c) to (7f) would hold with equalities at the optimum; otherwise a
larger optimal weighted sum rate can always be obtained. Therefore,
problem (7) is equivalent to problem (5).
One can see that the objective function and most of the con-
straints of problem (7) are convex, except the constraints in (7c)
and (7e), and the nonconvex rank-one constraints in (7h). Let
({w¯i}Ki=1, {R¯i}Ki=1) be a feasible point of problem (2). Define
x¯ki  ln(w¯
H
k Qkiw¯k), k ∈ Kci , (8a)
y¯i  ln(2
R¯i − 1), (8b)
for i = 1, . . . ,K. Then {{x¯ki}k =i, y¯i}Ki=1 together with R¯i, x¯ii 
ln(w¯Hi Qiiw¯i), W¯i  w¯iw¯Hi and z¯i  ey¯i−x¯ii for i = 1, . . . ,K,
are feasible to problem (7). We aim to conservatively approximate
(7c) and (7e) with respective to the point {{x¯ki}k =i, y¯i}Ki=1. Since
exki is convex, its first-order approximation at x¯ki, i.e., ex¯ki(xki −
x¯ki + 1), is a global underestimate of exki . Hence it is sufficient to
achieve (7c) by considering the following linear constraint
Tr(WkQki) ≤ ex¯ki(xki − x¯ki + 1), (9)
for k ∈ Kci . To approximate (7e), we consider the following lower
bound for eyi + 1:(
eyi
θi1(y¯i)
)θi1(y¯i) ( 1
θi2(y¯i)
)θi2(y¯i)
≤ eyi + 1, (10)
where θi1(y¯i) = ey¯i/(ey¯i + 1) and θi2(y¯i) = 1/(ey¯i + 1). Equa-
tion (10) is obtained from the inequality of arithmetic and geometric
means. By (10), a sufficient condition for (7e) can be obtained as
(θi1(y¯i))
θi1(y¯i)(θi2(y¯i))
θi2(y¯i)e(ln 2)Ri−θi1(y¯i)yi ≤ 1, (11)
for i = 1, . . . , K, which are convex constraints. By replacing (7c)
and (7e) with (9) and (11), respectively, and by ignoring the noncon-
vex rank-one constraints in (7h), we obtain the following approxi-
mation formulation for problem (7):

where Θi(y¯i)  (θi1(y¯i))θi1(y¯i)(θi2(y¯i))θi2(y¯i). Problem (12) is a
convex optimization problem; it can be efficiently solved by standard
convex solvers such as CVX [7].
The idea of removing the nonconvex rank-one constraints of
{Wi}Ki=1 in (12) is known as semidefinite relaxation (SDR) in con-
vex optimization theory [9]. SDR is in general an approximation
because the optimal {Wi}Ki=1 of problem (12) may not be of rank
one. Surprisingly, it is found that, for all the problem instances we
tested in simulations, problem (12) always yields rank-one optimal
solution, {Wi}Ki=1, i.e., Wi = wi(wi)H for all i, provided that
Wi = 0. This implies that an approximate beamforming solution to
(2) can be directly obtained by decomposing the optimal {Wi}Ki=1
of (12).
3.3. Sequential Convex Approximations
The formulation (12) is obtained by approximating problem (2) with
respect to the feasible point ({w¯i}Ki=1, {R¯i}Ki=1) [see (8)]. It is pos-
sible to further improve the approximation performance by solving
problem (12) iteratively with the optimal ({wi}Ki=1, {Ri}Ki=1) at the
current iteration used as the feasible point ({w¯i}Ki=1, {R¯i}Ki=1) for
the next iteration. The proposed sequential approximation algorithm
is summarized in the following Algorithm 1:

a solution accuracy δ > 0.

ey¯i/(ey¯i + 1) and θi2(y¯i) = 1/(ey¯i + 1) for i = 1, . . . , K.

the beamforming vectors {w¯i}Ki=1 are simply set to w¯i =

In the simulations, we consider the multiuser MISO-IFC as de-
scribed in Section 2. For simplicity, all the receivers are assumed
to have the same noise power, i.e., σ21 = · · · = σ2K  σ2, and all
the power constraints are set to one, i.e., P1 = · · · = PK = 1.
The channel covariance matricesQki were randomly generated. We
normalize the maximum eigenvalue of Qii, i.e., λmax(Qii), to one
for all i, and normalize λmax(Qki) to a value η ∈ (0, 1] for all
k ∈ Kci , i = 1, . . . ,K. The parameter η, thereby, represents the
relative cross-link interference level. If not mentioned specifically,
the ranks of Qki are all set to Nt. We consider the sum rate maxi-
mization problem by setting α1 = · · · = αK = 1 for problem (2),

ABSTRACT
Endmember extraction is of prime importance in the process of hy-
perspectral unmixing so as to study the mineral composition of a
landscape from its hyperspectral observations. Though, a whole
bunch of pure-pixel based endmember extraction algorithms exists,
the quest for a reliable, repeatable, and computationally efficient
endmember extraction algorithm still prevails. In this work, we pro-
pose two pure-pixel based endmember extraction algorithms called
simplex estimation by projection (SIMPLE-Pro) algorithm and p-
norm based pure pixel identification (TRI-P) algorithm. The end-
member identifiability of the proposed two algorithms is theoreti-
cally proved under the pure pixel assumption. Both algorithms never
require any initializations and hence they are repeatable. Monte
Carlo simulations are performed to demonstrate the superior effi-
cacy and computational efficiency of the proposed two algorithms
over some existing benchmark endmember extraction algorithms.

Pure pixels, Endmember identifiability
1. INTRODUCTION
Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) is a process of extracting endmember
signatures and their corresponding abundance maps from the mea-
sured hyperspectral images, over a scene of interest [1]. Existing
HU algorithms can basically be classified into two groups, one fo-
cusing on pure pixels (pixels in the observed hyperspectral data, that
are contributed by a single endmember only) and the other with-
out relying on pure pixels. Based on the linear mixing model (to
be discussed later), identifying those pure pixels in the data cloud
will directly yield the endmember signatures. Thus, the pure-pixel
based algorithms aim to find the pure pixels in the given observa-
tions, and thus can only estimate the endmember signatures. Hence,
those algorithms are aptly called as endmember extraction (EE) al-
gorithms, and they are the ones considered in this work. EE algo-
rithms currently available in the literature, include pixel purity index
(PPI) [2], N-finder (N-FINDR) [3], convex cone analysis (CCA) [4],
simplex growing algorithm (SGA) [5] [6], vertex component analy-
sis (VCA) [7], and alternating volume maximization (AVMAX) [8],
to name a few. Once the pure pixels (endmember signatures) are
identified by EE algorithms, the corresponding abundance estimates
can be obtained by using the fully constrained least squares (FCLS)
algorithm [9].
Some issues associated with the above mentioned algorithms are
discussed next. Firstly, for noisy observations, EE algorithms such
as PPI, N-FINDR, and VCA are sensitive to initialization and hence
This work was supported by the National Science Council (R.O.C.) un-
der Grants NSC 99-2221-E-007-003-MY3 and NSC 96-2628-E-007-003-
MY3.
are not repeatable [5]. Secondly, though the computational com-
plexity of EE algorithms is generally lower when compared to that
of HU algorithms without relying on the pure pixels, it increases
with the number of pixels and the number of endmembers present in
the given hyperspectral data. Hence, a computationally efficient EE
algorithm will always be preferred for real-time analysis of hyper-
spectral data. More importantly, rigorous theoretical proofs for the
endmember identifiability of the above mentioned algorithms (ex-
cept for AVMAX) are yet to be investigated.
The prime focus of this work is to propose reliable, repeatable
and computationally efficient pure-pixel based algorithms for end-
member extraction, along with a theoretical guarantee for their end-
member identifiability. In this regard, we propose two endmem-
ber extraction algorithms, namely simplex estimation by projection
(SIMPLE-Pro) and p-norm based pure pixel identification (TRI-P,
abbreviated for Triple-P). As in the aforementioned EE algorithms,
we begin with the linear mixing model for HU [2–8]. In our first
algorithm (SIMPLE-Pro), the principle is to project the data onto a
vector orthogonal to the affine hull of already found endmember sig-
natures. The index corresponding to the minimum of the projected
values yields a new pure pixel. In the second algorithm (TRI-P), the
data are projected onto a subspace orthogonal to already found end-
member signatures, and maximum p-norm is used to identify a new
pure pixel. In both algorithms, prior to endmember extraction, the
affine set fitting procedure [10] is used for dimension reduction, and
then maximum p-norm is used to find the first endmember signature.
The notations used in this paper are briefed as follows: RM and
R
M×N represent the set of realM×1 vectors andM×N matrices,
respectively, 1N represents the N × 1 all-one vector, and IN is the
N×N identity matrix. The symbol ‖ ·‖p represents the p-norm and
Q† stands for Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of matrixQ.
2. LINEAR MIXINGMODEL
Consider a scenario in which a hyperspectral sensor withM spectral
bands measures solar electromagnetic radiations reflecting from N
distinct substances, over a scene of interest. Due to low spatial res-
olution, each pixel vector of the measured hyperspectral image cube
can be described by anM ×N linear mixing model [1, 3, 7]:
x[n] = As[n] =
N
 
i=1
si[n]ai, ∀n = 1, . . . , L, (1)
where M is the number of spectral bands and N is the num-
ber of endmembers present in the scene. Further, x[n] =
[ x1[n], . . . , xM [n] ]
T is the nth pixel vector in the hyperspectral
observation, A = [ a1, . . . , aN ] ∈ RM×N denotes the endmember
signature matrix whose ith column vector ai is the ith endmember
signature (or simply endmember), s[n] = [ s1[n], . . . , sN [n] ]T ∈

It follows that P⊥Bαk = P⊥Bαq, q = 1, . . . , k − 1. By pre-
multiplying by αTq on both sides, we get
α
T
q P
⊥
Bαk = α
T
q P
⊥
Bαq, q = 1, . . . , k − 1. (16)
Since the projector P⊥B is positive semi-definite; i.e., αTq P⊥Bαq ≥
0, we have
α
T
q d
 = αTq P
⊥
Bαq ≥ 0, q = 1, . . . , k − 1. (17)
Moreover, it is straightforward to see from (12) thatαTk d ≥ 0. Due
to the nature of {x˜[n]}Ln=1, which is centered at the origin, there
exists at least one vector in {x˜[n]}Ln=1 such that x˜[n]T d < 0. This
can also be justified by the fact that there exists pixel vectors on
either side of the hyperplane {y ∈ RN−1 | yTd = 0}. Therefore
(14) will never yield an index that was already identified; i.e., the
new index lz ∈ {l1, . . . , lk} and further, due to (13), the obtained
index must be a pure pixel index. Thus x˜[lz] ∈ {αk+1, ..., αN}. 
By repeating the above procedure for k = 1, . . . , N − 1, all
the dimension-reduced endmembers can be identified. The resulting
EE algorithm is the SIMPLE-Pro algorithm, which is summarized in
Table 1.

find the vector d as given by (12).
Step 3. Update k := k + 1 and then obtain αk = x˜[lk] for any
lk ∈ arg minn=1,...,L{x˜[n]

Step 4. Go to Step 2 until k = N − 1.
Step 5. Output the dimension-reduced endmember estimates
α1, ..., αN .
5. P -NORM BASED PURE PIXEL IDENTIFICATION
In this section, we present yet another EE algorithm namely the TRI-
P algorithm to find the dimension-reduced endmembers. Unlike the
previous EE algorithm, here we begin by incorporating the assump-
tion (A2) in (5) so that we have the following augmented dimension-
reduced data:
x¯[n] =  
x˜[n]
1 
=
N

i=1
si[n]α¯i ∈ R
N , (18)
where α¯i = [αTi 1]T , i = 1, . . . , N are the augmented dimension-
reduced endmembers. As in SIMPLE-Pro, following the steps
leading to Lemma 1, one can show that a pure pixel index
(and therefore an endmember) can be perfectly identified from
arg maxn=1,...,L{‖x¯[n]‖p}, under (A1)-(A4) (see (8)).
Suppose that α¯i is already found. To find a new endmember
different from α¯i, we consider the following subspace projection:
x[n] = P⊥
α¯i
x¯[n] =
N

k=1,k =i
sk[n]P
⊥
α¯i
α¯k,∀n, (19)
whereP⊥
α¯i
= IN −α¯i(α¯
T
i α¯i)
−1α¯Ti is the orthogonal complement
projector of α¯i. Then, a new dimension-reduced endmember can be
identified as stated in the following lemma:

α¯1
(0, 0)
α¯2
x¯[n]
x[n]
P⊥α¯1α¯1 = 0
Fig. 2. Illustration of TRI-P for N = 2. Assume that α¯1 has been
found. α¯2 = x¯[l2], where l2 ∈ arg maxn=1,...,L{‖x[n]‖p}, and
x[n] is given by (19).
Lemma 3. Suppose that α¯i has been found. Then, under (A1)-
(A4), a new dimension-reduced endmember can be identified by
αj = x˜[lj ] (20)
for any lj ∈ arg maxn=1,...,L‖P⊥α¯i x¯[n]‖p and αj = αi.
Proof: By the triangle inequality, (A1), (A2), and (18), we have
‖P⊥
α¯i
x¯[n]‖p ≤

k =i
sk[n]‖P
⊥
α¯i
α¯k‖p ≤ max
k =i
{‖P⊥
α¯i
α¯k‖p}. (21)
The inequality in (21) holds with equality if and only if n = lj
for any j ∈ arg maxk =i {‖P⊥α¯i α¯k‖p}. So one can find a
new dimension-reduced endmember αj = x˜[lj ] for any lj ∈
arg maxn=1,...,L{‖P
⊥
α¯i
x¯[n]‖p} and αj = αi. 
To find the next dimension-reduced endmember, the projected
data x[n] is again projected onto to a subspace orthogonal to the
previously found endmember; P⊥
α¯j
x[n]. Then by Lemma 3, one
can identify another new dimension-reduced endmember. The pro-
cedure is repeated until all theN endmembers are found. The above
endmember estimation methodology is the TRI-P algorithm which
is summarized in Table 2. Figure 2 illustrates the idea of TRI-P for
the N = 2 case.

Step 1. Obtain α¯i = x[li] for any li ∈ arg maxn{‖x[n]‖p}.
Step 2. Calculate P⊥

x[n] := P⊥

x[n].
Step 3. Update i := i + 1, and go to Step 1 if i ≤ N .
Step 4. Output x˜[l1], ..., x˜[lN ] as the estimates of α1, ..., αN .
Remarks: Existing pure-pixel based EE algorithms such as PPI,
VCA, N-FINDR and SGA require initializations. For both of the
proposed algorithms SIMPLE-Pro and TRI-P, there is no need of
any initialization, and hence they are repeatable. While both TRI-P
algorithm and VCA [7] involve the notion of orthogonal complement
projections, there exists a subtle algorithmic difference between the
two: VCA involves some sort of random vector projection in end-
member estimation, but there is no randomness involved in TRI-P.

ABSTRACT
Recently, robust transmit beamforming has drawn considerable at-
tention because it can provide guaranteed receiver performance in
the presence of channel state information (CSI) errors. Assuming
complex Gaussian distributed CSI errors, this paper investigates the
robust beamforming design problem that minimizes the transmission
power subject to probabilistic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) constraints. The probabilistic SINR constraints in general
have no closed-form expression and are difficult to handle. Based on
a Bernstein-type inequality for quadratic forms of complex Gaussian
random variables, we propose a conservative formulation to the ro-
bust single-cell beamforming design problem. The semidefinite re-
laxation technique can be applied to efficiently handle the proposed
conservative formulation. Simulation results show that, in compari-
son with existing methods, the proposed method is more power effi-
cient and is able to support higher target SINR values for receivers.

laxation, convex optimization.
1. INTRODUCTION
Linear transmit beamforming has been recognized as a powerful
technique since it can achieve a large fraction of capacity with low
implementation complexity. Conventionally, it is assumed that the
transmitter has perfect channel state information (CSI) of the re-
ceivers, and the beamforming vectors are optimized such that the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements of the
receivers can be satisfied. In practical situations, however, the CSI
at the transmitter is inevitably subject to errors due to finite-energy
training and limited feedback. The presence of CSI errors will result
in receivers’ performance outage. Therefore, robust transmit beam-
forming designs that take the CSI errors into consideration [1, 2, 3, 4]
are of great importance.
In this paper, we assume that the CSI errors are complex Gaus-
sian distributed and study the stochastic robust beamforming design
problem under a single-cell system with multiple single-antenna re-
ceivers. Specifically, we study the robust design formulation that
minimizes the transmission power subject to probabilistic SINR con-
straints on the receivers [2]. The probabilistic SINR constraints guar-
antee the receivers’ SINR requirements to be satisfied with a pre-

determined, high probability (i.e., a low outage probability). The
robust design problem is difficult to solve because the probabilistic
SINR constraints in general do not have closed-form expression and
are not convex. To efficiently handle this problem, so-called con-
servative approaches that aim to obtain efficient approximate solu-
tions guaranteeing the probabilistic SINR requirements are proposed
[2, 4]. In particular, the authors of [2] used the results in [5] to show
that an approximate solution of the robust design problem can be ef-
ficiently obtained by solving a semidefinite program (SDP). In [4], a
more efficient conservative formulation is presented which also in-
volves solving an SDP.
In this paper, we present a new conservative approach to the
probabilistic SINR constrained robust beamforming problem. The
idea of the proposed method is based on the observation that each of
the probabilistic SINR constraints involves a quadratic form of com-
plex Gaussian random variables, which allows us to use a Bernstein-
type inequality1 [6] to bound the outage probability. By recognizing
that the Bernstein-type inequality can be reformulated as a system of
conic inequalities, we obtain a new conservative formulation of the
robust beamforming problem. Although the proposed formulation
is still a nonconvex optimization problem, it can be handled very
effectively by a convex relaxation method, called semidefinite re-
laxation (SDR). The presented simulation results show that the pro-
posed method is more power efficient and less conservative com-
pared to existing methods.
2. SIGNALMODEL AND PROBLEM STATEMENT
We consider a multiuser wireless system consisting of a multiple-
antenna transmitter andK single-antenna receivers. The transmitter,
equipped withNt antennas, wants to communicate with the receivers
using transmit beamforming. Let si(t) denote the information signal
for receiver i. The transmit signal is given by
∑K
i=1wisi(t) where
wi ∈ CNt is the beamforming vector for si(t). The received signal
at receiver i is given by
yi(t) = h

+ ni(t), (1)
where hi ∈ CNt denotes the channel vector of receiver i, and ni(t)
is the additive noise at receiver i. It is assumed that ni(t) has zero
mean and variance equal to σ2i > 0 for all i = 1, . . . , K. Assume
1Roughly speaking, a Bernstein-type inequality is one which bounds the
probability that a sum of random variables deviates from its mean.

holds true if the following inequality is satisfied
Tr(Q)−
√
2δ
√
‖Q‖2F + 2‖u‖2 − δs+(Q) ≥ c. (13)
Equation (13) thus serves as a conservative formulation for (12).
Now, a crucial observation is that (13) can be represented by

and applying (14) to (9), we obtain the following problem

as a conservative formulation for problem (7), where vec(·) denotes
the column-by-column matrix vectorization.
Our derived conservative formulation (16) is desirable since it
has closed-form expressions with the constraints. However, prob-
lem (16) is nonconvex, owing to the fact that Qi(w1, . . . ,wK),
ui(w1, . . . ,wK) and ci(w1, . . . ,wK) are indefinite quadratic in
{w1, . . . ,wK} [see (10)]. Next, we will handle this problem by
using the SDR technique [10].
3.2. Semidefinite Relaxation
To apply SDR to the conservative formulation (16), we let Wi =

then constrainingWi to be positive semidefinite only, we obtain the

for i = 1, . . . ,K. Note that the constraints in (17b), (17c) and
(17d) are respectively a linear constraint, a convex second-order cone
(SOC) constraint and a convex PSD constraint. Hence problem (17)
is a convex conic problem and can be efficiently solved by standard
solvers such as CVX [11].
The SDR problem (17) is in general a relaxation of problem (16)
because the associated optimal {Wi}Ki=1 may not be of rank one. If
the optimal {Wi}Ki=1 of (17) is of rank one, i.e.,Wi = wiwHi for
all i, then {wi}Ki=1 is an optimal solution to problem (16); otherwise
additional solution approximation procedures to turn the optimum
{Wi}Ki=1 into a rank-one approximate solution of problem (16) is
needed [10]. Fortunately and rather surprisingly, it is found by simu-
lations that problem (17) always yields rank-one optimal {Wi}Ki=1.
This implies that the globally optimal solution of the conservation
formulation (16) may be attained by SDR, at least for all the problem
instances we tested in simulations. Also, under the same argument,
the feasibility of (16) may be equivalent to that of (17).
3.3. Reducing the Level of Conservatism by Bisection
Analogous to the methods presented in [2, 4], it is found that the
proposed conservative formulation (16) with δi set as in (15) may
yield beamforming solutions that correspond to an SINR satisfaction
probability [in (7b)] much higher than 1−ρi. According to (11), the
SINR satisfaction probability achieved by formulation (16) can be
reduced by decreasing the parameter δi. Hence the bisection method
presented in [2, 4] can be used to reduce the level of conservatism of
problem (16).
To illustrate how this method works, let us assume that all the re-
ceivers have the same SINR outage probability, i.e., ρ  ρ1 = · · · =
ρK . Thus we can let δ  δ1 = · · · = δK [see (15)]. For a given
δ, one can obtain a beamforming solution by solving (16) and use
the validation procedure in [5] to test if the associated probabilistic
SINR constraints in (7b) are empirically satisfied or not. If yes, the
parameter δ can be reduced; otherwise it should be increased. The
procedure is repeated until a predefined stopping criterion is met.
Readers are referred to [2, 4] for further details.
4. SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
In this section, we present some simulation results to demonstrate the
performance of the proposed method. We consider the wireless sys-
tem as described in Section 2 with three antennas at the transmitter
and with three receivers (Nt = K = 3). For simplicity, we con-
sider independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) complex Gaus-
sian CSI errors, i.e., Ci = I for all i, and set  = 0.002. The noise
variances of all receivers are set to 0.01 (σ21 = σ22 = σ23 = 0.01),
and the outage probabilities are set to 0.1 (ρ1 = ρ2 = ρ3 = 0.1),
i.e., 90% satisfaction probability. The target SINR values of all re-
ceivers are also set to be the same, i.e., γ  γ1 = γ2 = γ3. We com-
pare the proposed conservative formulation in (16) with the method
presented in [4] and the Formulation I in [2]. The bisection tech-
nique mentioned in Section 3.3 was also implemented for the three
methods under test. The parameter setting of this technique follows
that in [4]. All three methods were implemented using CVX [11].
Since a less conservative method is more likely to be feasible, in
the first example, we examine the feasibility rates of the three meth-
ods under test and their bisection counterparts. To this end, 500 sets
of channel estimates {h¯i}3i=1 were generated according to complex
Gaussian with zero mean and covariance matrix I. Figure 1 shows
the simulation results of feasibility rate (%) versus target SINR γ.

會議名稱 2013 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC-2013)   
發表論文題目 #1.  Outage Constrained Transmission Optimization for MISO Two-Tier Femtocell Networks (K.-Y. Wang, N. Jacklin, Z. Ding, and Chong-Yung Chi)   
 
一、參加會議經過 
 
筆者於 102年 6月 08日 (Saturday night) 從桃園中正機場出發， 6月 9日 (Sunday) 上午於維
也納轉機，晚上抵達 Budapest, Hungary. The following is a summary of the major activities and 
events that I participated in during the ICC 2013, a flag-ship international conference on 
Communications.  
 
6/10 (Monday): 完成報到手續 and met international friends and experts; participated in  
(a) 09:00-09:45 Keynote Presentation, “5G – What will it Be: The Tactile Internet,” by Dr. 
Gerhard P. Fettweis (cfAED Scientific director and coordinator, Vodafone Chair Professor, 
TU Dresden). 
(b) 11:00-12:30 WC-02 (Femtocells): presented Paper#1 (Outage Constrained Transmission 
Optimization for MISO Two-Tier Femtocell Networks) by my Ph.D. student Kun-Yu Wang 
(the first author).  
Our paper is the first paper in this session and this session is the first session of ICC 2013. I 
am glad that Kun-Yu gave a very good presentation with self-confidence. The session chair, 
Prof. Athanasios V. Vasilakos, University of Western Macedonia, Greece, recently invited us 
to write a joint research paper to be published in IEEE Communications Magazine. After the 
session is finished, we had some discussion about paper outline in the joint research paper.  
 
(c) 14:00-15:30 CT-03 (Interference Channels)   
 
6/11 (Tuesday): met international friends and experts; participated in  
(a) 09:00-10:30 CT-05 (Energy Efficient Networks); SPC-09 (Transceiver Techniques II)  
 3 
to offer a 2-week short course, Convex Optimization from Fundamentals to Applications, 
7/12-7/25, for making joint high-quality research breakthroughs. The purpose for this short 
course is that participants can smoothly and efficiently learn how to solve an optimization 
problem, from the fundamental theory, problem definition, reformation into a convex 
problem, analysis, algorithm implementation, to cutting edge researches (like an exploration 
journey rather than pure mathematics) in signal processing, communications, etc. Moreover, 
in the Summer 2013, there will be two visiting students, one from Peking University and one 
from France to join my group for some joint research exploration; an Indian student and a 
student form 蘭州大學 will join my group to pursue Master and Ph.D. degree Fall 2013. 
Hopefully, we can make high-quality and high-impact research contributions to promote our 
international recognition.

FUE, whereas nF (t) ∈ C is the additive noise at FUE with
power σ2F > 0. The first term in (1) is the intended signal for
FUE, and the second term is the interference from macrocell.
Assume that sM (t) has zero mean and E[|sM (t)|2] = 1. Then
the SINR at FUE can be obtained from (1) as
SINRF =
hHFFQFhFF
|hHFMwM |
2 + σ2F
, (2)
and the interference power at the MUE from the femtocell can
be seen to be hHMFQFhMF where hMF ∈ CNF denotes the
channel vector between FBS and MUE.
Typically, femtocells are connected to macrocell network via
a wired broadband backhaul link such as digital subscriber line
(DSL) [7], and thus we assume that the beamforming vector at
the MBS, wM , is perfectly known to the FBS. In this work, we
consider the scenario that the FBS receives no instantaneous
channel estimate from the FUE and only knows statistical
channel information. In particular, the channel vectors hFF ,
hFM , and hMF are assumed to be circularly symmetric
complex Gaussian distributed with zero mean and covariance
matrix σ2FF INF (an NF × NF identity matrix), σ2FMINM ,
and σ2MF INF , respectively, i.e., hFF ∼ CN (0,σ2FF INF ),
hFM ∼ CN (0,σ2FMINM ), and hMF ∼ CN (0,σ2MF INF ).
Let γF ≥ 0 and #M ≥ 0 be the preset target SINR value
at the FUE and the preset interference power threshold at the
MUE. Due to channel fading, the QoS may suffer from outage,
i.e., it would have nonzero probability for SINRF < γF
and hHMFQFhMF > #M . To mitigate this QoS outage, our
goal is to design the transmit covariance matrix, QF , such
that the outage probability is kept below a small threshold.
Mathematically, the problem can be reformulated as
min
QF∈H
NF
Tr(QF ) (3a)
s.t. Prob
{
hHFFQFhFF
|hHFMwM |
2+σ2F
≥γF
}
≥1− ρF , (3b)
Prob
{
hHMFQFhMF ≤ #M
}
≥ 1− ρM , (3c)
QF " 0, (3d)
where ρF and ρM denote the preset maximum tolerable outage
probabilities for SINR and interference power constraints,
respectively. However, problem (3) is intractable since the
probability functions in (3b) and (3c) have no closed-form
and may not be convex in general.
III. OPTIMAL TRANSMISSION STRATEGY
To solve problem (3), let us write
QF =Tr(QF )Q˜F , hFF =σFF · vFF , hMF =σMF · vMF ,
(4)
where Q˜F " 0, Tr(Q˜F ) = 1; vFF ∼ CN (0, INF ); and
vMF ∼ CN (0, INF ) are power normalized counterparts of
QF , hFF , and hMF , respectively. With the expressions in
(4), problem (3) can be equivalently written as
min
Q˜F∈H
NF ,PF∈R
PF ! Tr(QF ) (5a)
s.t. Prob
{
vHFF Q˜FvFF ≤
γF
σ2FFPF
×
(|hHFMwM |
2 + σ2F )
}
≤ ρF , (5b)
Prob
{
vHMF Q˜FvMF ≤
#M
σ2MFPF
}
≥1−ρM , (5c)
Q˜F " 0, Tr(Q˜F ) = 1, PF ≥ 0. (5d)
We should point out that constraint (5c) actually provides
an upper bound on PF for which problem (5) is feasible.
Therefore, to minimize the transmit power PF , we need only
consider constraints (5b) and (5d).
Let us first consider problem (5) without constraint (5c),
min
Q˜F∈H
NF ,PF∈R
PF (6a)
s.t. Prob
{
vHFF Q˜FvFF ≤
γF

×
(|hHFMwM |
2 + σ2F )
}
≤ ρF , (6b)
Q˜F " 0, Tr(Q˜F ) = 1, PF ≥ 0. (6c)
One can observe that constraint (6b) must be active when the
optimal Q˜F and PF are achieved. Then the resulting equality
constraint implies that minimizing the probability function in
(6b) (which is a monotonic non-increasing function of PF )
will minimize PF . For this reason, the optimal Q˜F is obtained
by solving
min
Q˜F"0,Tr(Q˜F )=1
E
[
Prob
{
vHFF Q˜FvFF ≤
γF
σ2FFPF
×
(z + σ2F )
∣∣∣∣ |hHFMwM |2 = z
}]
, (7)
where the expectation is taken with respect to the exponential
random variable |hHFMwM |2. With the optimal Q˜F , denoted
by Q˜!F , the optimal P !F to problem (6) can be obtained by
solving
E
[
Prob
{
vHFF Q˜

FvFF ≤
γF
σ2FFPF
×
(z + σ2F )
∣∣∣∣ |hHFMwM |2 = z
}]
= ρF . (8)
However, the optimal transmission strategy Q!F = P !F Q˜!F for
problem (6) may not be feasible to problem (5) because it may
not satisfy the probability constraint (5c). Due to this concern,
in the next subsection, we will propose a feasibility condition
under which Q!F is feasible and optimal to problem (5).We now concentrate on solving problem (7). Consider
the eigenvalue decomposition of Q˜F = UΛUH , where
U ∈ CNF×NF is a unitary matrix and Λ ∈ RNF×NF is a
diagonal matrix with eigenvalues λ1, . . . ,λNF ≥ 0 being thediagonal elements. Since unitary transformation of Gaussian
random vector will not change their joint probability density3589
holds true, where

n = 1, . . . , NF − 1,
NF , ∀(1− ρM ) ∈ [0, p(2NF − 2, 2NF )),
in which p(0, 2) ! 1.
Proof: We prove Proposition 1 by considering problem (5)
with DoF d = 1, which can be equivalently expressed as [10]:

[i.e., problem (20) with (20c) replaced by (21c)]:

n = 1, . . . , NF − 1,
NF , ∀(1 − ρM ) ∈ [0, p(2NF − 2, 2NF )),
(22)
which has been proven in [11]. We will use the following
lemma [10]:
Lemma 1 Problem (21) is feasible if and only if

If problem (21) is feasible, i.e., (23) holds true, then problem
(20) is also feasible since the feasible set of constraint (21c)
is a subset of constraint (20c) since F−12θ (1−ρM) ≥ F−12 (1−
ρM ) = ln(1/ρM ) [by the definition in (22)], i.e.,
P¯F (θ) ≤
#M
σ2MF ln(1/ρM)
. (24)
That is to say, problem (5) with DoF d = 1 is feasible if
problem (21) is feasible.
Next, we show that the optimal transmit power to problem
(5) with DoF d = 1, denoted as PF (1) [which is obtained by
solving (13)], must be less than or equal to P¯F (θ), i.e.,
PF (1) ≤ P¯F (θ). (25)
Since one can always find a feasible power to problem (21),
say P˜F , which is also feasible to problem (5) with DoF d = 1
[due to (24)], if PF (1) > P¯F (θ) holds, then we have P˜F ≤
P¯F (θ) < PF (1), which is a contradiction to PF (1) being the
optimal (minimum) power to problem (5) with DoF d = 1.
Since PF (1) ≥ PF (d!) [by (12)] and P¯F (θ) ≤ P¯F (d!) [by
(21c) and (22)], according to (25), we have PF (d!) ≤ P¯F (d!),
which means that the transmission strategy in (15) is feasible
to problem (5). The proof is thus complete. "
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS
We consider FBS and MBS each equipped with four trans-
mit antennas, i.e., NF = NM = 4. Let maximum tolerable
outage probabilities ρF = ρM = 0.1, requiring that the SINR
constraint at FUE and the interference power constraint on
MUE be satisfied over 90% of the time. Assume σ2F = 0.01
and #M = −3 dB. The beamforming vector wM at MBS
is randomly generated uniformly on the unit-norm sphere
‖wM‖2 = 1. Considering the indoor scenario for FBS where
the channel strength of hMF and hFM are much lower than
that of hFF due to penetration losses [3], we set σ2FF = 1,
and σ2MF = σ2FM = 0.01.
In our first example, we show the distribution of achiev-
able SINR of FUE, i.e., the value of SINRF in (2), ob-
tained over 105 realizations of true i.i.d. channels hFF ∼
CN (0,σ2FF INF ), hMF ∼ CN (0,σ2MF INF ), and hFM ∼
CN (0,σ2FMINM ). The target SINR γF is set to 15 dB. One
can show that the transmission strategy in (15) is optimal
to problem (3), or equivalently problem (5), according to
Proposition 1, and the optimal DoF d!, defined in (12), can
be obtained numerically as d! = NF . Figure 1 shows the
distribution of the achievable SINR of FUE, where “Optimal
Transmission Strategy” and “Optimal Beamforming Strategy”
denote the results from using the transmission strategy in (15)
with d = NF and d = 1, respectively. The optimal transmit
beamformer can be determined as wF !
√
PF (1)uF , where
PF (1) is the transmit power obtained by solving (13) with
d = 1, and uF ∈ CNF is an arbitrary column vector
with ‖uF‖ = 1. From this figure, we can see that both
methods can achieve 90% SINR satisfaction probability. In
addition, the mean SINR value of the FUE using the optimal
transmission strategy is 19.85 dB, which is lower than the
corresponding 25.45 dB from using the optimal beamforming
strategy, and this indicates that FBS can save transmit power
while achieving the same desired SINR performance when
using the optimal transmission strategy.
Next, we compare the transmit power performance of the
optimal transmission strategy and the optimal beamforming
strategy under different target SINR values γF . The obtained
results are shown in Fig. 2, where “Optimal Transmission
Strategy” and “Optimal Beamforming Strategy” denote the3591
