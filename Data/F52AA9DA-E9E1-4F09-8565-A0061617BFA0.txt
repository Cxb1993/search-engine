approximations. We can reduce the cost of controller by choosing initial condition. The results 
will later contribute to the formation flight of spacecraft about the Earth orbit with applications to 
interferometric imagining. 
 
2. Dynamics Model 
2.1 General Equations of Motion 
A spacecraft formation problem is usually formulated as the problem of relative motion with a 
chief spacecraft on the nominal trajectory and a deputy spacecraft in the vicinity. Therefore, the 
linearization technique is usually applied to derive the dynamics of the relative motion of the 
deputy. 
Consider a body-fixed frame attached on the chief spacecraft where x points from Earth to the 
spacecraft, y points along direction of the motion of the chief spacecraft, and z completes the triad, 
as shown in Fig. 1. Assume that the nominal trajectory is only governed by the Earth, meaning 
that the chief spacecraft moves in a Keplerian orbit. Given the eccentricity e, the true anomaly f, 
and the position vector of the chief spacecraft R at any time instant, we can write down the 
dynamics of the deputy spacecraft as [13]:

where 3/lcn Rµ=  is the local mean motion and ( , , )x y zδ =r  denotes the relative position of 
the deputy spacecraft. By setting e = 0, Eq.(1) degenerates to the Clohessy-Wiltshire Equation, 
which describes the relative motion about a circular orbit. Generally speaking, Eq. (1) does not 
have a closed-form solution, except for e = 0.  
 
2.2 The Tschauner-Hempel Equation 
Instead of time, the mathematics model in the Tschauner-Hempel Equation uses the true 
anomaly f as the independent variable, and therefore implicit in time. Provided the deputy

where )(′  and )( ′′  denotes the derivatives with respect to f. Actually, Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) can be 
transformed to each other through the transformation: rr δδ R= , where R=R  is the distance of 
the between the chief spacecraft to the center of the planet. The symmetry in the force potential 
term makes the T-H Equation easier to analyze, and thus, Eq. (2) has a general analytic solution

Eq. (6). Therefore, we can view the variable t  in Eq. (6) as a free parameter, and apply the same 
analysis in the preceding section to Eq. (11) simply by letting t f= . Moreover, all norms are 
equal since )( fA  is finite dimension, we select the norm∞ −  of a matrix in practical

As a result, ( ) ( )i iA f A f fδ′>> , implying that the local time approximation is applicable to 
our system given the system variable f. 
In practical issue, however, we usually deal with a dynamical system under time domain, in 
which the system variable is the time t . Hence, we have to consider the influence of variance in t 
to the variance in f. Recall that 1 coslcdf dt n e f= + , as given in Eq. (1). lcn  is the local mean 
motion and usually has the order of 310−  to 510− , from the low Earth orbit to the 
geosynchronous orbit. Letting 1 coslcf n e f tδ δ= + , we conclude that 1fδ <<  as long as 
1<<tδ . As a result, the algorithm of local time approximation is concluded applicable to the 
Keplerian orbit.  
4. Control Law Design 
4.1 Control law Design in Time Domain 
Having proved that the local time approximation is applicable to the Keplerian orbit with 
frame into account, we can view the uncontrolled formation as spacecraft orbiting in two 
neighboring elliptical orbits with same period. Under this situation, the relative motion of the 
deputy spacecraft to the chief spacecraft would naturally be periodic. 
To be consistent with proceeding discussion, we would also like to investigate this algorithm 
in the rotational frame attached with the chief spacecraft. We first formulate the motion of chief 
spacecraft in the geocentric rotational frame whose rotation rate equals to that of chief spacecraft 
orbiting the Earth, meaning that ( ,  0,  0)
rc R=R , where the subscript “rc” means rotational 
frame with the chief. Similarly, we can formulate the motion of the deputy spacecraft as 
( ,  0,  0)
rd r=r  in the geocentric rotational frame whose rotation rate equals to that of deputy 
spacecraft orbiting the Earth. 
Then we can transform the position vector into the geocentric inertial frame with rotation 
matrices, 1[R ] and 2[R ] , such that 
1[R ]I rc=R R , 2[R ]I rd=r r  
The composite rotation matrices 1[R ] and 2[R ]  can be computed in the following way: 
[R ] ( ) ( ) ( ) 1,2k z k x k z k kR R i R f kω= Ω + =  
where Ω , i, ω , and f denote the longitude of ascending node, the inclination, the argument of 
periapsis, and the true anomaly, respectively, and the rotation matrices xR  and zR  are defined 
as: 
1    0        0
( ) 0 cos  - sin

  
 
Then, the relative motion in the inertial frame is: 
2 1[R ] [R ]I rd rcδ = −r r R  
By pre-multiplying the inverse of 1[R ] , we can obtain the relative motion in the rotation frame 
centered at the chief spacecraft, as usually discussed:

r                                                    (20) 
To do formation flight, the relative trajectory must be periodic, implying that the original two 
orbits must have the same periods. In two-body problem, this leads to two spacecraft staying in 
the orbits with identical semi-major axis. Moreover, for future use we define 1 2∆Ω = Ω − Ω , 
1 2i i i∆ = − , 1 2ω ω ω∆ = −  and 1 2e e e∆ = − . Here we also assume that 1∆Ω  , 1i∆  , 
1ω∆   and 1e∆  , leading to 1δr  , so that we can further simplify our result. To 
distinguish the regular difference from the a small amount, we change the capital “ ∆ ” to the 
small “δ ” in the orbit elements in the following derivation. Equation (20) then can be simplified

5.2 Application to Formation about Circular Orbits 
 5. Numerical Simulation 
Figures 2 – 4 give some numerical simulation about the algorithm derived previously. The 
original excursions in both cases are about 50 m, leading to the spread of the whole formation 
being 100 m. We can see that the formation trajectory is similar to the original nominal trajectory, 
but with scaled sizes. Costs of formation of a single spacecraft are also presented in Figs. 4 and 7, 
and from the plots we can see that they are expensive for small satellites. 
As shown in Fig. 5, the true trajectory with initial conditions from the C-W Equation drifts 
away although they remain circular in the linear version. On the contrary, the true trajectory with 
initial conditions from the full approach remain circular even under nonlinear circumstance. 
Figure 6 gives the error analysis of the two methodologies. We define the error between true 
trajectory and predicted trajectory as t pε δ δ= −r r , where tδr  denotes the true trajectory and 
pδr  denotes the predicted trajectory by the C-W Equation or the full approach methodology. We 
can see that the largest error generated in our prediction is only half of that generated in the C-W 
Equation. The two examples are simulated with initial 70 km excursion in the y z−  plane for 
interferometric image purpose. 
 
6. Conclusions 
The control law design for relative trajectories about a Keplerian near-circular orbit with 
applications to the formation flight of spacecraft is investigated in this paper. Starting from 
results of the Tschauner-Hempel Equation (T-H Equation), we analytically prove the applicability 
of the “local time approximation”, which has been shown perform well in controlling the 
formation about the halo orbits, to the T-H Equation. We then come up with two potential design 
methods of control law, one in the time domain and the other in the true-anomaly domain. The 
control law will result in a three dimensional oscillator so that a general trajectory can be 
generated. By designing the control law in the true-anomaly domain, we not only stabilize the 
unstable relative trajectory, but also “re-construct” the “scaled” nominal orbit for our formation 
of spacecraft. Numerical simulations are also presented to verify our results. We also conclude 
that the cost is reasonable for the formation flight of regular satellites from the numerical results.
