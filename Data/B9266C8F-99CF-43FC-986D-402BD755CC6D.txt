Abstract 
Cu-13.5Al-4Ni shape memory alloy (SMA) exhibits a 1β (DO3)→ '1β (18R) internal friction 
peak with high damping capacity and elevated martensitic transformation temperature in a 
dynamic mechanical analysis tan δ cooling curve. When the specimen is kept isothermally at 
peak temperature, the damping capacity decreases significantly and reaches a steady value. The 
inherent and intrinsic internal frictions of Cu-13.5Al-4Ni SMA are extremely low because the 
'
1β (18R) martensite has an ordered 9R structure with stacking faults rather than twinning with 
movable twin boundaries. 
 
Keywords: shape memory alloys (SMA); martensitic transformation; internal friction; dynamic 
mechanical analysis (DMA). 
 
1. Introduction 
Shape memory alloys (SMAs) exhibiting 
a thermoelastic martensitic transformation can 
show unique properties such as shape memory 
effect (SME) and superelasticity (PE) [1]. 
SMAs also have good internal friction and are 
potential candidates for high damping 
applications [2-5]. The damping properties of 
SMAs are usually investigated using a 
conventional inverted torsion pendulum or by 
dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) at a 
constant cooling/heating rate. When the 
damping capacity of SMAs is examined by an 
inverted torsion pendulum or DMA, an 
internal friction peak (IF peak) appears at the 
martensitic transformation temperature and its 
damping capacity is closely related to the 
conducted experimental parameters such as 
cooling/heating rate (
•
T ), frequency (υ ) and 
applied amplitude ( 0σ ) [2, 6]. The IF peak of 
SMAs can be decomposed into three 
individual terms (i.e., IF=IFTr+IFPT+IFI) [6-8]. 
The first term IFTr is the transient internal 
friction which appears only at low frequency 
 4
174.2oC, respectively. The storage modulus of 
the specimen increased gently in the parent 
phase then dropped drastically (from about 
55,000 MPa to 37,000 MPa) and showed a 
deep minimum during martensitic 
transformation. Figure 1(b) shows the XRD 
result of the DMA specimen in Fig. 1(a) 
measured at room temperature. As illustrated 
in Fig. 1(b), only the diffraction peaks of '1β  
martensite with 18R structure can be observed 
and indexed [13, 14]. Accordingly, the IF peak 
shown in the tan δ curve in Fig. 1(a) can be 
confirmed as the 1β (DO3)→ '1β (18R) 
martensitic transformation.  
Figure 2 plots the tan δ values vs. the 
isothermal time interval of Cu-13.5Al-4Ni 
SMA when the DMA specimen was kept 
isothermally at the 1β (DO3) parent phase 
(210oC), 1β (DO3)→ '1β (18R) IF peak 
temperature (170oC) and the '1β (18R) 
martensite phase (140oC) for 30 min. When 
the specimen was kept isothermally at the 
1β (DO3) parent phase and the '1β (18R) 
martensite phase, as shown in Fig. 2, the tan δ 
values do not show conspicuous variation 
throughout the isothermal treatment, and both 
of their IFI are close to tan δ=0.003. However, 
when the specimen was kept isothermally at 
1β (DO3)→ '1β (18R) IF peak temperature, the 
tan δ value significantly decreases with the 
isothermal time interval and reaches a steady 
value of about 0.005 after 30 min. The 
decayed tan δ value during isothermal 
treatment represents the IFTr which is 
associated with the magnitude of 
•
T , as shown 
in Fig. 2, while the steady tan δ value after 
isothermal treatment is the IFPT+IFI which is 
independent of 
•
T  [9]. Note that the tan δ 
value of IFTr for Cu-13.5Al-4Ni SMA 
collapses quickly during isothermal treatment 
(i.e., 95% of IFTr diminishes in 11 min time). 
Besides, Fig. 2 shows that the damping 
capacity of IFPT+IFI is very close to that of the 
IFI of the 1β (DO3) parent phase and the 
'
1β (18R) martensite phase. This characteristic 
reveals that the tan δ value of IFPT for 
Cu-13.5Al-4Ni SMA is extremely small.  
To investigate the damping 
characteristics of Cu-13.5Al-4Ni SMA under 
isthermal conditions more carefully, the DMA 
isothermal tests were conducted at more 
temperatures around the martensitic 
transformation region and Fig. 3(a) shows the 
results. In Fig. 3(a), the solid line represents 
the tan δ cooling curve for Cu-13.5Al-4Ni 
SMA measured at 
•
T =3oC/min (same as the 
tan δ cooling curve shown in Fig. 1(a)) and 
the empty circles symbolize the steady tan δ 
values measured after being isothermal for 30 
min at different temperatures. As shown in Fig. 
3(a), the damping capacity of Cu-13.5Al-4Ni 
SMA measured by the isothermal DMA test 
(tan δ < 0.005) is much smaller than the 
damping capacity of the IF peak measured at a 
constant 
•
T  (tan δ=0.17). Figure 3(b) shows 
the magnified empty circles curve in Fig. 3(a) 
for more clarity. As can be seen in Fig. 3(b), 
an inconspicuous inherent IF peak 
( 18RDOIPT 3)IF(IF →+ ) still exists during the 
1β (DO3)→ '1β (18R) martensitic 
transformation. The damping capacity of 
18RDOIPT 3
)IF(IF →+  (tan δ=0.005) is slightly 
higher than the damping capacity of the IFI of 
the 1β (DO3) parent phase and the '1β (18R) 
martensite phase (both are close to tan 
δ=0.003). However, each tan δ value of IFPT 
and IFI is not easy to define exactly. From Fig. 
3, we can calculate the contribution of 
18RDOIPT 3
)IF(IF →+  to the overall IF peak of 
 6
Cu-13.5Al-4Ni SMA exhibits a 
1β (DO3)→ '1β (18R) IF peak with high 
damping capacity and elevated Ms 
temperature during martensitic transformation 
when the specimen is measured at a constant 
cooling/heat rate by DMA. The damping 
capacity of the 1β (DO3)→ '1β (18R) IF peak 
decreases significantly and reaches a steady 
value when the specimen is kept isothermally 
at peak temperature for 30 min. The 
1β (DO3)→ '1β (18R) IF peak is mainly 
constructed by IFTr instead of IFPT or IFI. The 
extreme low damping capacity of the 
18RDOIPT 3
)IF(IF →+  peak and IFI of the 
'
1β (18R) martensite phase for Cu-13.5Al-4Ni 
SMA comes from the fact that the '1β (18R) 
martensite phase has an ordered 9R structure 
with stacking faults instead of twinning with 
abundant high mobility twin boundaries.
