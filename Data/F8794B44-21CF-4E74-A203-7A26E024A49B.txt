Further improvement and circuit application using new functional HPTs based on the 
experiment results/model previously developed were the key topics studied in this year. 
Concerning with electro-optical switches, we have focused on the fabrication and measurement 
in static/dynamic characteristics for double-emitter phototransistors. Emitter-induced gain effect 
from photocurrent- and junction-voltage-modulation was introduced and employed to enhance 
optical gains. Furthermore, DEPT employed as tri-state logic devices was also successfully 
implemented. So far, important results available include comprehension and modeling of HPT 
operated in the Gummel-plot and common-emitter modes, DEPT with both voltage- and 
power-tunable optical gains, comparison of tuning performance between biased-emitter DEPT 
and base-biased HPT, low-power detection of phototransistors treated by chemical surfactants, 
dynamic switch behaviors in phototransistors, theoretical analysis about emitter-induced gain 
effect of phototransistor as electro-optical switch, and long-term reliability for low-power 
phototransistors.  
 
 
一、 前言 
 
 
光電零組件與微波零組件間進行晶片級積體化成例如光接收器者，如典型的光電積體

前項措施增加載子穿越時間，後者則則易造成基極對其之碰穿，使得整體架構與個別元件

低訊號/雜訊比。另外結構間的不匹配卻仍是另一最大障礙。 
    基於 HBT 並與之晶膜、製程和傳輸機制等均相符合的 HPT 而言，最近一、二十年來
廣受矚目與重視，並幾乎是為目前積體化最佳組合。早期 HPT 係以浮置基極的方式形成二

InAlAs/InGaAs 等 HPT、DHPT 均在近十年陸續有相關研究與光電積體電路(OEIC)，以及
光電單石微波積體電路(OEMMIC)應用成果發表。但是這種直接以所形成的光電流決定
HPT 靜態操作點之特性雖具有光功率調變式光增益(power-tunable optical gain)，很遺憾地，

電流增益(current gain)急速降低，致使在微小光功率訊號之偵測所得增益(optical gain)相當

Abstract
Fabrication, characterization and modelling of heterojunction
phototransistors (HPTs) are reported. The common-emitter (with
current-biased base) and Gummel-plot (with voltage-biased base) modes are
employed to characterize and fully comprehend what differences exist
between the current- and voltage-biased HPT’s performance. The results of
further studies include the case when a series of different optical-power
injection levels is illuminated at our HPTs. The performance of the current-
and voltage-biased HPTs was also compared to that from a newly proposed
HPT model and related equivalent circuit with good agreement found.
Although an independent voltage source can be used to tune the operating
point of a heterojunction bipolar transistor to a higher current level where
the dc current gain is larger, the photocurrent generated within the
base–collector (B–C) region offers few contributions to the final collector
photocurrent. The optical gain obtained from the HPT biased using a high
voltage is even smaller than that of the HPT with a floating base. It is
concluded that (i) a current-biased HPT’s dc base current and photocurrent
generated within the B–C region entirely flow into the base–emitter (B–E)
junction so that the device’s optical gain is enhanced; (ii) however, no
enhancement of optical gain for a HPT will be obtained using dc base bias,
since the dc current gain is independent of collector
(or base) current; (iii) a voltage-biased HPT behaves like a p–i–n photodiode
and (iv) electrical base bias using a high external voltage source with a large
series resistance is a possible way to enhance the optical gain of a HPT.
1. Introduction
For monolithically integrated optical receivers based on
heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs), p–i–n photodiodes
have been widely employed for optical detection [1, 2]. In
general, the base, collector and sub-collector layers of a HBT
are designed to implement the p–i–n photodiode. However,
the epistructure must be a compromise to ensure the proper
performance for the two devices, limiting the performance of
each device. An alternate, commonly used photodetector, the
avalanche photodetector (APD), suffers from avalanche noise
[3]. The heterojunction phototransistors (HPTs) using III–V
compound semiconductor materials have been extensively
studied in the past two decades [4–8]. This is because
of their potential as a high-performance photodetector for
lightwave communications and a possible alternative to a

by incorporating in parallel a constant current source between the
base and collector terminals. Either an independent voltage source
or an independent current source applied to bias the base is
employed to study the HPT’s performance.

for forward and reverse operation, respectively. Both ηE and
ηC are those of the base junction. βF is forward current gain
and βR is reverse current gain. The base electrical current
in this model is represented by two sets of parallel diodes.
One set corresponds to the base–emitter (B–E) junction and
the other set corresponds to the B–C junction. The use
of two parallel diodes to simulate each junction makes it
possible to account for the bias dependence of dc current
gain. One diode in each set corresponds to the current due
to the recombination in the space-charge region. This current
component is represented by the ideality factor ηE for forward
operation and is generally close to 2. The other diode in
each set is directly proportional to one of the components of
the current source between the emitter and the collector. The
voltages VB′E′ and VB′C ′ appearing in (1) and (2) are the internal
voltages across the B–E and B–C junctions, respectively. All
the baseline parameters except for Iph are extracted as described
in [15]. To determine Iph, typical p–i–n mode current–voltage
characteristics measured for the HPT with (solid line) and
without (dashed line) 15 µW optical injection are shown in
figure 3. Therefore, the photocurrent generated within the
B–C region in the p–i–n mode is the difference between these
two currents. Also note that the generated Iph in saturation is
about 2.68 × 10−6 A and is almost independent of VBC. This
is believed to be due to short-wavelength optical injection that
is not optimized for the HPT measurement. The Gummel plot
of the HPT is a measure of the collector and base currents as
a function of VBE at VBC = 0 V. Accordingly, (1) and (2) are
simplified by ignoring IEC and IBC and taking into consideration
the effects of the series resistances as

Recalling figure 2, an independent voltage source is
applied to give VBE. Knowing VBE and the device-related
parameters, one can solve the two simultaneous equations (3)
and (4) and then finally obtain both the collector and base
currents as a function of VBE for the HPT under constant
optical-power injection. Since the base current (IB = IBdc)
functions as an input variable in the common-emitter mode,
the IC value together with VBE in (3) and (4) can be estimated
as a function of Iph (and hence optical power).
4. Experimental, modelling results and discussion
4.1. Common-emitter electrical/optical characteristics
The common-emitter characteristic is a measure of the
collector current as a function of collector–emitter voltage,
VCE, for several distinct values of the base current. Basically,
there are two different configurations for a HPT. One is the
three-terminal configuration with the base current as an input
parameter and the other is the two-terminal configuration with
a floating base. Shown in figure 4(a) are the calculated
collector current, optical gain and responsivity as a function
of input optical power for a two-terminal HPT with a floating
base. It is found that the collector current is increased with
increasing optical power. Basically, Iph is totally injected into
the B–E junction and then is amplified by dc current gain β,
resulting in a collector current equalling (β + 1) × Iph. Note
that β is generally a function of base current and is increased
with increasing base current. In this case, the optical power
takes the lead role as the electrical base current in the HBT.
The higher the optical power, the larger the base current (and
hence Iph). So we observe that the induced photocurrent at the
collector terminal (IC) is increased with increasing optical
power. Experimental results (symbol ) also show the same
trend and are in good agreement with calculated ones. Besides,
both the optical gain and responsivity that are proportional to
d[(β +1)Iph]/dPin also increase with increasing optical power.
Experimental and calculated results show that the optical gain
(responsivity) increases from 3.1 to 6.83 (1.5 to 3.25 A W−1)
as the optical power increases from 15 to 121 µW.
With regard to the current-biased HPT, the optical-gain
enhancement is more significant. Figure 4(b) shows the

ones both in the dark and under constant 15 µW optical
injection, indicating that the proposed equivalent-circuit model
is promising for the HPT. In the case of the base and collector
currents under constant 15 µW optical injection, the effects
of the optical absorption are negligible in comparison with the
currents arising from the transistor’s operation at the high base
bias (VBE > 1.1 V). However, at the low base bias (VBE <
0.83 V), the collector current saturates at a low level of 2.68 ×
10−6 A, the same as Iph. Similarly, the reverse base current at
such a low base bias also saturates at the same current level.
Note also that there is a notch in the base current–voltage
characteristic (at VBE = 0.94 V) while the characteristic is
unchanged at high biases. Based on (4) and the superposition
principle for VBE and Iph, the notch and reversal in the base
current–voltage characteristics can be well explained. In
figure 2 in the dark, VBE determines the electrical base current,
i.e. IBdc, flowing into one set of parallel diodes corresponding to
the B–E junction. However, when the HPT is illuminated, the
photocurrent generated within the B–C region under constant
optical-power injection will flow into the node B′ and then be
shared by the B–E junction and the base resistance (RB). At
the low VBE, the equivalent resistance of the B–E junction is
very large due to the extremely small size of IBdc. In other
words, Iph at such a low bias is much larger than IBdc resulting
from VBE and is almost totally injected into the base electrode.
Therefore, we observe that the total base current saturates at
the same current level as Iph (but in the reverse direction). With
increasing applied VBE, IBdc is increased but Iph injected into the
base electrode is nearly unchanged (which will be discussed
later). When IBdc from the applied VBE is close to Iph for the
15 µW optical injection, the notch in the base current–voltage
is found to occur at VBE = 0.94 V. At the high VBE bias, Iph
injected into the base is only slightly reduced but is negligible
in comparison with IBdc. So the final base current is dominated
by IBdc.
Shown in figure 7(a) are the calculated collector and
base current–voltage characteristics for a series of different
optical-power injection levels to further investigate the effects
of the optical absorption. Iph seen in (3) and (4) can be
deduced for each optical-injection level from the two-terminal
HPT’s optical characteristics and/or p–i–n mode current–
voltage characteristics. At low VBE, both the collector and
reverse base currents are found to saturate at the value of Iph

corresponding to the incident optical power. In addition, we
see that the notch in the base current–voltage characteristic
moves to a higher VBE with increasing optical power. These
results are reasonable. The larger the optical power, the higher
the Iph. Therefore, a higher VBE is needed to yield an equal IBdc
for cancelling out Iph injected into the base terminal seen in
figure 2. Figure 7(b) shows the dc current gain as a function of
VBE, which is deduced from the results shown in figure 7(a).
In the absence of optical injection, the current gain rises
with increasing VBE and saturates. At low VBE, all of the
current gains under different optical-power injections go to
unity since the base and collector currents become equal as
shown in figure 7(a). The peak in the current gain under optical
injection corresponds to the notch in the base current–voltage
characteristics for each level of optical injection. Even though
the peak current gain may be as high as several thousand, it has
no use for practical circuit applications. These measured and
calculated results are in good agreement with [9, 10], but not
with [11]. Song et al [11] claim that at the low voltage under
illumination, the reverse base current of InGaP HPTs is larger
than that of AlGaAs HPTs, and the current gain becomes
smaller (∼1 for InGaP HPTs and ∼10 for AlGaAs HPTs).
They conclude that the current gain at the low voltage depends
on the valence-band discontinuity (EV) and the larger EV
of InGaP HPTs than AlGaAs HPTs prevents most of the holes
from being injected into the emitter, the holes diffuse out of
the base contact, generating the larger reverse base current.

Abstract
N–p–n InGaP/GaAs Dual-Emitter HPTs (DEHPTs) with and without extrinsic base surface passivation
were fabricated to investigate the influence of the surface leakage on the device’s optical performance. There
are four operating regions appearing in the output characteristics of DEHPTs under illumination: negative-
saturation, negative-tuning, positive-tuning and positive-saturation regions. The InGaP-passivated DEHPT
(P-DEHPT), i.e. DEHPT with the extrinsic base surface passivated by InGaP, exhibits the maximum optical
gains of 46.57, 46.86 and 47.39 while the non-passivated one (NP-DEHPT) shows ones of 32.02, 33.55
and 33.57 for optical powers of 8.62, 13.2 and 17.5 µW, respectively. However, the NP-DEHPT exhibits
the larger peak gain-tuning efficiencies of 37.35, 41.03 and 44.10 compared to 12.76, 13.72 and 16.01 V−1
for the P-DEHPT for optical powers of 8.62, 13.2 and 17.5 µW, respectively. The better tuning efficiency
makes the NP-DEHPT a possible low optical power optoelectronic application.

(n+ = 5 × 1018 cm−3), a 0.6 µm n−-GaAs collector (n− = 5 × 1016 cm−3), a 0.14 µm p+-
GaAs base (p+ = 4 × 1019 cm−3), a 0.07 µm n-InGaP emitter (n = 5 × 1017 cm−3) and a
0.3 µm n+-GaAs cap layer (n+ = 5 × 1018 cm−3). Carbon and silicon were used as p- and
n-type dopants, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b), the proposed DEHPTs with and
without the InGaP passivation layer were fabricated to have dual emitters, a common floating
base and a common collector. The fabrication procedure began with AuGe metal deposition
upon the cap layer with patterned dual-emitter formation. AuGe, a eutectic alloy with the
melting point of 360 ◦C, is applied in proportions of 88% Au and 12% Ge by weight. The
emitter areas (AE1 and AE2) for the E1 and E2 electrodes are 120 × 150 and 30 × 150 µm2,
respectively. Then the AuGe dual-emitter metals together with the patterned photoresist were
used as an etching mask to selectively remove the GaAs cap layer (or both of the GaAs cap
layer and the InGaP emitter layer) for the InGaP-passivated (non-passivated) DEHPT, named
P-DEHPT (NP-DEHPT). The mixture solutions used for etching the InGaP and GaAs layers
were 1H3PO4:1HCl and 3NH4OH:1H2O2:50H2O, respectively. For the collector contact, the
base mesa was continued to the subcollector layer to deposit AuGe metal as the collector
electrode. After accomplishing device isolation, the emitter and collector ohmic contacts were
then optimized by thermal annealing. Thermal annealing enhances the robustness of the contact
metal and reduces the series resistance to prevent undesired voltage consumption. The exposed
optical absorption area between these two emitters is 4×10−4 cm2. Both a P- and a NP-HBT/HPT
with a base electrode were also fabricated on the same chip using the standard triple-mesa
processes. The P- and NP-HBTs/HPTs also exhibit both an absorption area of 4 × 10−4 cm2
and a total emitter area of 150× 150 µm2.
Fig. 2 shows the Gummel plots for the P- and NP-HBT/HPT measured in the dark. It is found
that the collector current characteristics for the P- and NP-HBT are almost identical [18–20].
Both calculated collector current ideality factors are 1.02. This can be mainly attributed to two
factors. One of them is that the InGaP passivation layer is fully depleted. If the InGaP passivation
layer were not fully depleted, there would be parasitic current in the passivation layer. The dc
current gain could be expected to reduce dramatically. The other is that the increment of the
collector current due to the use of the InGaP passivation layer is far smaller than the level of

one at the same optical power. This results from the fact that the wide-gap InGaP passivation layer
is transparent to the 850 nm incident light and simultaneously helps to reduce the surface leakage.
Therefore, a better responsivity can be achieved. On the basis of these results for the floating
emitter operation of the HBT/HPT, we expect the benefit of employing an InGaP passivation
layer to be of significance for enhancing the optical performance of the fabricated DEHPTs.
Taking the P-DEHPT into consideration, the incident light can be almost entirely injected and
absorbed in the effective absorption region (shown in Fig. 1(a)) due to the reduction of the
extrinsic base surface defect via the passivation layer. However, some incident light would be
absorbed at the surface defects of the NP-DEHPT (shown in Fig. 1(b)). The parasitic p–i–n
photocurrent generated could be expected to be larger for the P-DEHPT than that for the NP-
DEHPT for the same level of incident optical power (Ip(P) > Ip(NP)).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. The DEHPT performance
We define the collector photocurrents (1ICPs) as 1ICP(P) and 1ICP(NP) for the P- and NP-
DEHPTs, respectively. Fig. 3(a)–(c) show the measured collector photocurrents (1ICP(P) and
1ICP(NP)) as a function of the voltage difference of these two emitters VE2 for the P- and NP-
DEHPT at a series of different levels of optical power. There are four operating regions in
the current–voltage characteristics for both P- and NP-DEHPT: negative-saturation, negative-
tuning, positive-tuning and positive-saturation regions. Basically, the collector photocurrent of
the DEHPT is attributed to the sum of currents injected from the B–E1 and B–E2 junctions [16].
Since the DEHPT has a common floating base–collector junction, the photocurrent generated
within the parasitic p–i–n diode takes the role of the base biasing current. In addition to the base
current density-dependent current gains (β(J )), the current injection capabilities of the B–E1 and
W.-T. Chen et al. / Superlattices and Microstructures 40 (2006) 45–55 51
where Ip = Ip1 + Ip2 (Ip1 = 0.8Ip, Ip2 = 0.2Ip) and Jp = Jp1 = Jp2 = Ip/(AE1 + AE2).
In other words, the collector photocurrent 1ICP at VE2 = 0 V is determined by both β(Jp)
and Ip. According to the dc current gain characteristics shown in Fig. 2, the P-DEHPT always
operates with a dc current gain higher than that of the NP-DEHPT at the same base current
level (i.e., β(P)(JB) > β(NP)(JB)). The larger Ip(P) obtained in the P-DEHPT further yields
a higher current gain β(P)(Jp(P)). This explains why the measured collector photocurrents at
VE2 = 0 V of 263.5, 408.1 and 548.8 µA for the P-DEHPT for optical powers of 8.62, 13.2
and 17.5 µW, respectively, are much larger than those of 155.4, 255.7 and 344.3 µA for the
NP-DEHPT. In addition to the power-tunability of the collector photocurrents at VE2 = 0 V,
by varying the incident optical power, it is found that they are also voltage-tunable. Increasing
negative VE2 leads the B–E2 junction to operate with more forward-biased capability while the
B–E1 junction operates with less. This eventuates in operation in the negative-saturation region.
The B–E2 junction dominates the operation while the B–E1 junction is off-conduction (shown in
Fig. 4(b)). Hence the photocurrent generated within the parasitic p–i–n diode flows totally across
the B–E2 junction, resulting in a current density (Ip/AE2) that is five times that for the case at
VE2 = 0 V (Ip/(AE1 + AE2)). When the device operates in the negative-saturation region, the
saturated collector photocurrents for the P- and NP-DEHPT come totally from the B–E2 junction
and are expressed as
1ICP(P) = [β(P)(5J p(P))+ 1] × Ip(P) (3a)
1ICP(NP) = [β(NP)(5J p(NP))+ 1] × Ip(NP). (3b)
The measured values are 274.9 (189.0), 423.5 (303.3) and 567.9 (402.3) µA for the P-DEHPT
(NP-DEHPT) for optical powers of 8.62, 13.2 and 17.5 µW, respectively. These results are in
good agreement with what is expected based on the increased dc current obtained at a larger
JB , as shown in Fig. 2. By contrast, increasing positive VE2 activates the B–E1 junction and
simultaneously weakens the B–E2 junction conduction capability (shown in Fig. 4(c)). The
DEHPT operates eventually in the positive-saturation region shown in Fig. 3. The magnitude
of the shared Ip1 is identical to Ip while the Ip2 is zero. Therefore, the current density is 1.25
times that of the case at VE2 = 0 V, where the collector photocurrents coming totally from the
B–E1 junction are expressed as
1ICP(P) = [β(P)(1.25Jp(P))+ 1] × Ip(P) (4a)
1ICP(NP) = [β(NP)(1.25Jp(NP))+ 1] × Ip(NP). (4b)
In this case, the saturated 1ICP(P)s (1ICP(NP)s) are 265.6 (161.2), 411.0 (263.9) and 552.4
(354.2) µA for the P-DEHPT (NP-DEHPT) for optical powers of 8.62, 13.2 and 17.5 µW,
respectively. Eqs. (3a), (3b), (4a) and (4b) indicate the significance of the DEHPT with two
different emitter areas. For each level of optical power, the collector photocurrents obtained can
be larger as long as the operation is dominated by the B–E2 junction (the B–E junction with
the smaller emitter area) because the current density-dependent dc current gain β(5Jp) is larger
than β(1.25Jp). In this study, we fabricated the DEHPT with emitter areas of AE1 = 4AE2.
If we changed the areas as AE1′ = 2AE2′ (AE1 + AE2 = AE1′ +AE2′), the maximum collector
photocurrent could be obtained at the operation of the B–E2 junction (the B–E1 junction is
off-conduction) and the value would be expected to be smaller than that for the device with
AE1 = 4AE2 for the same incident optical power, since the larger the dc current gain, the larger
the collector photocurrent. However, the dc current gain β(Ip /AE2′) is smaller than β(Ip/AE2)
because AE2′ > AE2. What the results in Fig. 3(a)–(c) make clear is that (1) the collector

with an index, (ηC(P)) and (ηC(NP)), represent the current-tuning efficiency for the P- and NP-
DEHPT, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5, the ηC(NP)s for the NP-DEHPT are larger than the
ηC(P)s for the P-DEHPT when the incident optical power is at the same level. There is a peak
ηC observed in the negative-tuning region for the P- and NP-DEHPTs. Note that the peak values
in the negative-tuning region increase with increasing incident optical power. They are 94.50
(260.34), 123.96 (370.92) and 152.97 (447.65) µS for the P-DEHPT (NP-DEHPT) for optical
powers of 8.62, 13.2 and 17.5 µW, respectively. A peak ηC is also available in the positive-tuning
region for the P- and NP-DEHPTs. However, the peak ηC in the positive-tuning region is much
smaller than that in the negative-tuning region at the same incident optical power. This is because
the higher current density and hence dc current gain are available when the B–E2 junction with
the smaller emitter area is more forward biased in the negative-tuning region. Fig. 7(a)–(c) show
the gain-tuning efficiencies (ηG(P) and ηG(NP)) as a function of VE2 for the P- and NP-DEHPT,
where the gain-tuning efficiency (ηG) is defined as ηG = |dG/dVE2|. Similarly to the previous
results it is found that (i) the ηG(NP)s for the NP-DEHPT are larger than the ηG(P)s for the P-
DEHPT and (ii) a peak observed in the negative-tuning region is higher than that in the positive-
tuning region for the P- and NP-DEHPTs. However, in contrast to the previous results both peaks
obtained in the negative- and positive-tuning regions decrease with increasing incident optical
power. The peak ηG(P)s (ηG(NP)s) in the negative-tuning region are 12.76 (37.35), 13.71 (41.03)
and 16.01 (44.10) V−1 for the P-DEHPT (NP-DEHPT) for the optical powers of 17.5, 13.2 and
8.62 µW, respectively.
4. Conclusions
The proposed InGaP/GaAs dual-emitter phototransistors with and without an InGaP
passivation layer have been successfully fabricated and investigated. In the above discussion, we
mainly addressed the effects of what difference an InGaP passivation layer causes in the DEHPT
optical characteristics. The results show that (1) the P-DEHPT exhibits a larger magnitude
of collector photocurrents and optical gains than those for the NP-DEHPT and (2) the NP-

photocurrent determines the quiescent base current, the
higher the incident optical power is, the better the sensitiv-
ity is. Otherwise, a poor sensitivity is obtained under weak
illumination. However, an important consideration for
photodetection is low-power detection capability. In order
to get results, a three-terminal heterojunction phototransis-
tor (3T-HPT) with a biased base was recently proposed and
investigated [10–15]. According to previous report, the 3T-
HPT with a current bias source exhibits much better opti-
cal performance than that of the 3T-HPT with a voltage
bias source [14,15]. Considering the realization of bias
source in practical circuits, the voltage source is commonly
and facilely used. Therefore, another new three-terminal
heterojunction phototransistor with double emitters was
proposed [16]. No diﬃculty in realizing the external bias
circuit is concerned, but the better optical performance,
such as higher ﬁnal collector photocurrent and optical
gain, are still contained.
In this paper, a four-terminal dual-emitter heterojunc-
tion phototransistor (4T-DEPT) with a current-biased base
is proposed to compare with the 3T-DEPT with a ﬂoating
base. Both of voltage and current biases are contained in
the 4T-DEPT operations to obtain a preferable tuning per-
formance using a low optical and/or an electrical power. In
next section, the device structure, fabrication, and experi-
ment were introduced. The optical performance of the
3T- and 4T-DEPTs, including the voltage- and current-
dependent characteristics, was described and investigated
in Section 3. A qualitative consideration with an equivalent
circuit was presented in Section 4. Finally, a conclusion
was made.
2. Device structure and fabrication
The layer structure used in this study was grown by
low-pressure metal-organic chemical vapor deposition on a
(100)-oriented semi-insulating GaAs substrate. A 0.5 lm
thick n+-GaAs subcollector (n+ = 5 · 1018 cm3) was
followed by a 0.6 lm thick n-GaAs collector (n =
5 · 1016 cm3), a 0.14 lm thick p+-GaAs base (p+ =
4 · 1019 cm3), a 0.07 lm thick n-InGaP emitter
(n = 5 · 1017 cm3), and ﬁnally a 0.3 lm thick n+-GaAs
contact layer (n+ = 5 · 1018 cm3). Carbon and silicon were
employed as the p- and n-type dopants, respectively. The
device fabrication was initiated with patterning dual-emitter
metals (Au/Ge/Ni) by lift-oﬀ technique. One emitter (E1)
has an area of AE1 = 50 · 150 lm2 and the other (E2) has
an area of AE2 = 100 · 150 lm2. Then dual-emitter metals
together with patterned photoresist were used as the etch
mask during emitter mesa. The used etched solutions for
GaAs contact and InGaP emitter are NH4OH:H2O2:H2O
(3:1:50) and H3PO4:HCl (1:1), respectively. After the base
mesa was done, Au/Ge/Ni metal was again deposited upon
the exposed subcollector and was then annealed to optimize
the emitter and collector ohmic contacts. Following by the
deposition ofAuZnmetal upon the base layer, the device iso-
lation ended the fabrication process. Fig. 1 shows the 3D
schematic diagram of theDEPTwith a base electrode, where
the exposed extrinsic base layer with an area of 4 · 104 lm2
was employed as the absorption region.
The front side illuminating measurement was carried out
by means of a semiconductor laser (ACM (LD1469) X16)
operating at the wavelength of 850 nm and controlled by
a power supply (Model GPS-1850D). The exact incident
optical power was measured with a photodetector
(AC25HD) and a power meter (Vector H410). While the
illuminating measurement was progressing, the voltages
VE21 was applied between the emitters E1 and E2 to deter-
mine the ﬁnal collector photocurrent (DICP) and optical
gain (G). The E1 is at ground state. The voltage between
the collector and E1, VCE1, is ﬁxed at 2 V. To examine
the eﬀects of a biasing base current on the 4T-DEPT
Fig. 1. 3D schematic diagram of the 4T-DEPT with a base electrode.
W.T. Chen et al. / Solid-State Electronics 50 (2006) 1330–1336 1331
for the 3T-DEPT under Pin = 0.423, 3.49, and 8.62 lW.
Note also that the peak observed in the positive-tuning
region is more remarkable than that in the negative-tuning
region. It can be well explained by the current-sharing
eﬀect due to diﬀerent emitter-area ratio in [16]. As shown
in Fig. 3(b), the maximum voltage-dependent gG,Vs at a
Pin = 0.423 lW are 40.04, 45.03, and 35.72 V
1 for the
4T-DEPT biased at IBdc = 0.001, 0.25, and 2 lA, respec-
tively, while those for the 3T-DEPT under Pin = 0.423,
3.49, and 8.62 lW are 39.86, 43.42, and 37.76 V1. In
particular, the 4T-DEPT under Pin = 0.423 lW at IBdc =
0.25 lA is found to exhibit the largest gG,V.
To further understand the relationship between the volt-
age-dependent tuning eﬃciency and the IBdc, the maximum
VE21-dependent gC,V and gG,V as a function of IBdc are
shown in Fig. 4. The maximum gC,V and gG,V for the 4T-
DEPT, which can be obtained under Pin = 0.423 lW at
VE21 = 0.06 V while IBdc = 0.001 lA, are slightly larger
than those for the 3T-DEPT at the same VE21 under the
same Pin. As a result the base-current bias initiates the
enhancement of gC,V and gG,V at IBdc = 0.001 lA, ends that
at IBdc = 0.25 lA, and degrades that at IBdc > 0.25 lA.
3.2. Current-dependent characteristics
Shown in Fig. 5(a) are the DICP and G as a function of
IBdc for a 4T-DEPT under Pin = 0.423 lW at diﬀerent
VE21. These applied voltages are those where the voltage-
dependent tuning eﬃciency exhibits a small value
(VE21 = 0 V), the maximum value in the negative-tuning
region (VE21 = 0.04 V), almost zero in the negative-satu-
ration region (VE21 = 0.4 V), the maximum value in the
positive-tuning region (VE21 = 0.06 V), and almost zero in
the positive-saturation region (VE21 = 0.4 V), respectively.
All DICPs exhibit enhancement following by increasing
the IBdc and then saturate at IBdc > 100 lA. When the IBdc
applied is 0.001 lA, the minimum DICP of 3.30 lA and the
minimum G of 11.38 are obtained at VE21 = 0 V while the
maximum DICP and G are of 4.61 lA and 15.90 at
VE21 = 0.4 V, respectively. Furthermore, it can be clearly
noticed that the DICP obtained at VE21 = 0.06 V is almost
identical to that at VE21 = 0.4 V when the IBdc is smaller
than 1 lA. This is referred to the enhancement due to the
modulation by diﬀerent emitter-area ratio, which means
the DEPT with an optimized emitter area-ratio can works
with a low voltage supply. Otherwise, both the DICP and G
will reach a constant value when the IBdc is larger than
100 lA no matter what the applied voltage is. It denotes
that the eﬀect due to diﬀerent emitter area-ratio becomes
negligible at a high IBdc. Fig. 5(b) shows the IBdc-dependent
tuning eﬃciency. The current- and gain-tuning eﬃciencies
are individually deﬁned as gC,C = jd(DICP)/dIBdcj and
gG,C = jdG/dIBdcj. When the IBdc applied is 0.001 lA, the
gC,C and gG,C available are 16.45–21.40 and are 56.8–
73.87 lA1, respectively. Although the increased IBdc
degrades the gC,C and gG,C, the tuning performance is com-
parative better than that for voltage (VE21) dependence of
tuning eﬃciency described in Fig. 3(a) and (b). With the
addition of IBdc, the DEPT can also show good tuning

ﬂoating base under Pin = 0.423, 3.49, and 8.62 lW.

formed by the base, collector, and subcollector layers. The
voltage-controlled current sharing eﬀect at VE21 = 0 V is
shown in Fig. 6(a). At VE21 = 0 V, E1 and E2 are at the
same potential so that the B–E1 and B–E2 junctions exhibit
the same on-conduction level. The Ip together with
additional IBdc functions as the base current that is divided
into two portions (IP1 + IBdc1 and IP2 + IBdc2). Where
IBdc = IBdc1 + IBdc2, IP = IP1 + IP2, and the collector photo-
current can be obtained by ICP = ICP1(0) + ICP2(0) + Ip. In
the case of the operation at zero VE21 supply, the DICP of
the 4T-DEPT can be expressed as

in which IC1(0) and IC2(0) are the collector current compo-
nents (IC = IC1(0) + IC2(0)) in the dark (IP = 0). Implied in
b(x/y) is that the transistor current gain is a function of base
current density. Two terms contributing to the ﬁnal collector
photocurrent, DICP,4T = DICP1 + DICP2, separately stand
for the base biasing current (DICP1) and p–i–n photocurrent
(DICP2) associated ﬁnal collector photocurrent. It obviously
points out the signiﬁcance of base biasing current (IBdc) in
pushing the quiescent point to a higher level of internal tran-
sistor current gain. Operating in the positive-saturation re-
gion (VE21P 0.4 V), shown in Fig. 6(b), the voltage drop
across the B–E2 junction is far smaller than the turn-on volt-
age. Therefore, the B–E2 junction turns out oﬀ-conduction
while the B–E1 is turned on. The internal Ip together with
additional IBdc entirely ﬂows into the E1. The DICP,4T can
be similarly expressed as

where ICP1(+) is the collector photocurrent and IC1(+) is the

the negative-saturation region (VE21 6 0.4 V), shown in
Fig. 6(c), the B–E2 junction (the B–E1 junction is oﬀ-con-
duction) dominates the transistor operation. The DICP,4T

where ICP2() and IC2() are the collector currents under

above, the applied VE21 controls what the conduction level
of these two base–emitter junctions would be and further
aﬀects the shared portion of biasing current into E1 and
E2. This is what we call voltage-controlled current sharing
eﬀect. By virtue of the relation

it can be inferred that the quantity of the ﬁnal collector

In Fig. 7, it shows the IBdc dependence of DICP1 and DICP2
in diﬀerent operation regions. The DICP2 is superior to
DICP1 which is almost constant at any level of VE21. This
means that the ﬁnal collector photocurrent mainly attri-
butes to the IP while the IBdc contributes much to the pro-
motion of the internal transistor gain. It also implies that a
small IP, low optical power signal, can be ampliﬁed to
achieve a high-quality signal output with low noise because
of a small IBdc.
5. Conclusions
In order to get results, the addition of base biasing
current (IBdc) is expected to bring about enhancement on

Temperature-dependent dark and optical characteristics of the InGaP/GaAs heterojunction phototransistors HPTs with and
without sulfur treatment are studied. As compared to the HPT without NH42S treatment HPT A, treatment at 50°C for 20 min
leads to a reduced p-i-n dark current Idark and a reduced collector dark current ICdark for the HPT HPT D in the emitter-floated
and base-floated configurations, respectively. Moreover, the effective reduction of the surface defects also induces an enhanced
p-i-n photocurrent Iph. The enhanced Iph combined with the promoted dc current gain results in an enhanced optical gain G and
signal-to-noise ratio SNR. For HPT A D under Pin = 107.6 nW at 298 K, the G is 1.42 20.3 while the SNR is 42 94 dB.
Experimental results indicate that the treated HPTs, compared to the untreated one, are more sensitive to low-power illumination.

In the last decade, InGaP/GaAs and AlGaAs/GaAs heterojunc-
tion bipolar transistors HBTs have been the versatile microwave
devices with mature technologies. The superior potential of being
employed in high-speed digital circuit,1 microwave analog circuit,2
and wireless consumer products3 is attractive to modern applica-
tions. However, free GaAs surface naturally suffers from a large
surface recombination velocity and a high surface state density.
These defects detrimentally affect both electrical and optical char-
acteristics of the GaAs-based devices. Reliable surface passivation
techniques hence became an important issue. Covering the surface
with dielectric materials,4,5 passivating the surface via performing
chemical treatments,6-12 and passivating the extrinsic base surface
by emitter ledge structure13-15 are commonly used methods. Advan-
tages including i suppression of the surface recombination effects,
which causes a promoted current gain and possible operation at low
collector current regimes, ii reduction of sheet resistance and spe-
cific contact resistance, and iii improved thermal stability have
been demonstrated for HBTs with this surface passivation. Accord-
ingly, an emitter ledge structure has also been reported to enhance
the optical performance of heterojunction phototransistors HPTs.
Bansropun et al.,16 Tan et al.,17 and Chen et al.18 have verified the
capability of employing an emitter ledge structure to enhance the dc
current gain as well as the optical gain of HPTs. For low-power
photodetection, dark current is also an important index to examine
the quality of a photodetector and must be quashed. The effective-
ness of sulfur treatment has been demonstrated on reducing dark
currents of p-n and p-i-n photodiodes.19-21 However, few papers
have reported on the effects of surface chemical treatment on HPT
performance.
In this work, the temperature-dependent dark and optical charac-
teristics of the InGaP/GaAs HPTs are investigated. HPTs untreated
as well as HPTs treated with NH42S under various treatment con-
ditions were fabricated to compare their performance. In the next
section, experiments including structure and optical measurement
are described. The optical performance of all fabricated HPTs is
discussed in the Results and Discussion section. Finally, a conclu-
sion is made.
Experimental
Structure and fabrication.— The HPT structure depicted in Fig.
1a was grown on a 100-oriented semi-insulating GaAs substrate by
low-pressure metallorganic chemical vapor deposition LP-
MOCVD. The epitaxial layers include a 600 nm Si-doped n+-GaAs
subcollector n+ = 5  1018 cm−3, a 600 nm Si-doped n−-GaAs
collector n− = 1  1016 cm−3, an 80 nm C-doped p+-GaAs base
p+ = 4  1019 cm−3, a 30 nm Si-doped n-In0.5Ga0.5P emitter
n = 3  1017 cm−3, and a 200 nm Si-doped n+-GaAs subemitter
n+ = 3  1018 cm−3. Both the 50 nm n+-InxGa1−xAs x = 0–0.7
graded layer and the 50 nm n+-In0.7Ga0.3As cap layer were Te-doped
to 2  1019 cm−3. HPT fabrication was processed by standard pho-
tolithography and wet-chemical selective etching. Following the
sample cleaning, the triple-mesa procedure including emitter, base,
and isolation mesas was accomplished. Four sets of samples HPTs
A, B, C, and D, separated from the same chip, were prepared.
Subsequently, we rinsed HPTs B, C, and D with 1HF:8H2O solution
for 1 min before performing the surface sulfur treatment. The sur-
face sulfur treatment was carried out with NH42S solution S
weight concentration of 12%. HPT A was untreated, while HPTs B,

with increasing temperature. Therefore, heating results in the in-
creased Idarks for all HPTs. In the investigation of temperature-
dependent recombination on the exposed surface, Henderson has
stated a strong dependence of surface recombination on
temperature.27 Increasing temperature aggravates the effect of sur-
face recombination. Experimental results also indicate that the p-i-n
dark current of the untreated HPT HPT A suffers from strong
temperature dependence due to high surface recombination velocity.
Otherwise, effective surface sulfur treatment enables the treated
HPTs against high surface recombination velocity, adverse impact of
surface defects, and high dependence of degradation on temperature.
Especially, HPT D shows the best p-i-n dark performance, as com-
pared to the others.
Figure 3a shows room-temperature collector dark current ICdark
as a function of collector-emitter voltage VCE. Again, the better
collector dark-current performance is observed for the treated HPTs
as compared to HPT A. The ICarks of HPTs A, B, C, and D at
VCE = 1 V are 0.59, 0.25, 0.05, and 0.02 nA, respectively. The ratio
of ICdark between HPTs A and D is even a factor of 30. Because Idark
flowing directly toward emitter is amplified by the transistor action,
ICdark of HPT A is expected to be larger as compared to those of
treated HPTs HPTs B, C, and D. It is noted that the dark perfor-
mance of the p-i-n region extremely influences HPT dark perfor-
mance. The dependence of ICdark on temperature is shown in Fig. 3b.
It is found that ICdarks at 448 K are as high as 256, 52.7, 31.2, and
2.67 nA for HPTs A, B, C, and D at VCE = 1 V, respectively. As
shown in the inset, the ICdark 16.3 nA at 398 K for HPT A reaches
more than 1 order of magnitude larger than that at 298 K, while
other HPTs at 398 K show their ICdarks smaller than 2.5 nA scale.
The increase of ICdark following the increase of temperature is
caused by the thermal effects on Idark. The reduced temperature de-
pendence of ICdark has been achieved for treated HPTs in which HPT
D shows the best thermal stability.
Optical characteristics of the fabricated HPTs.— The relation-
ship between the optical power Pin and p-i-n photocurrent Iph is
shown in Fig. 4, where the expected improvement of optical absorp-
tion for the treated HPTs is clearly observed. The Iph was measured
by operating the HPT with a floating emitter. By controlling the Pin
upon the HPT under testing, the Iph generated in the B-C region can
be obtained by
Iph = Ip − Idark 5
where Idark and Ip are the p-i-n currents in the dark and under illu-
mination, respectively. All measured Iphs are almost independent of
the VBC and temperature and are nearly proportional to the Pin. For
constant optical injection, the surface quality is the only factor af-
fecting the optical-absorption performance. HPT D always exhibits
the largest Iph among fabricated HPTs under the same Pin. The Iphs
measured are 2.25 2.08, 4.24 3.91, 8.1 7.48, 9.77 9, 19.6
18.1, and 29.2 26.9 nA for HPT D C, while they are 1.82, 3.42,
6.55, 7.88, 15.8, 23.6 nA for HPT B under Pin = 8.3, 15.6, 29.9, 36,
72.3, and 107.6 nW, respectively. And they are 1.08, 2.04, 3.9, 4.69,
9.43, and 14 nA for HPT A under Pin = 8.3, 15.6, 29.9, 36, 72.3, and
107.6 nW, respectively. Referring again to Fig. 1b, an untreated
HPT has its optical absorption impeded by the surface defects on the
exposed base surface, which results in a small p-i-n photocurrent.
By contrast, incident lights penetrate more efficiently into the effec-
tive absorption region of the treated HPT, as shown in Fig. 1c. The
recombination of the generated electron-hole pairs due to the surface
potential is also reduced. Accordingly, the measured Iphs for the
treated HPTs are larger than that for the untreated one.
Figures 5a-d show room-temperature collector photocurrent ICP
as a function of VCE for all fabricated HPTs under various optical
powers. According to the circuit inserted in Fig. 5a, the ICP can be
expressed as
ICP = Iph + IdarkIB = Iph + Idark,T + 1 6
where the temperature-dependent dc current gain is determined by
the sum of Iph and Idark. In other words, the Iph together with Idark
now serves as the biased current similar to how the electrically-
biased base current functions in an HBT. As shown in Fig. 5d, for
example, the measured ICP = 1.11 A at VCE = 1 V for HPT D
under Pin = 107.6 nW corresponds to a IB  Iph = 29.2 nA,
298 K = 37. This value is in good agreement with experimental
results between  and IB. The measured room-temperature ICPs at
VCE = 1 V for HPT D C are 30 12, 78 35, 200 98, 261 132,
and 666 389 nA and 1.11 A 690 nA, while those for HPT B

D under Pin = 8.3 107.6 nW exhibits the advanced enhancement in
SNRs of 36–3 59–25 dB at 298–448 K. The SNRs for HPT D, in
particular when Pin is as low as 8.3 nW, are much enhanced as
compared to HPTs A, B, and C. Figure 7b shows the temperature-
dependent SNR of the collector current. The SNRs for HPT A under
Pin = 8.3 nW at 298–448 K are 5.9–65 dB, while those under
Pin = 107.6 nW positively increase to 42–18 dB. The SNRs for
HPT B C under Pin = 8.3 nW at 298–448 K are 23–51 48–45
dB, while those under Pin = 107.6 nW are 65–0.24 82–8 dB. HPT
D exhibits the advanced improvement on SNRs. The SNRs under
Pin = 8.3 107.6 nW are 63–0.33 94–38 dB at 298–448. The ratio
of room-temperature SNRs for HPT D under Pin = 8.3 nW to those
for HPT A under a higher Pin = 107.6 nW is about 1.5. Accordingly,
HPT D can be a reliable optical switch to be employed for applica-
tion under low-power illumination. However, HPTs A, B, and C are
not able to exhibit clear on/off states under low-power illumination
when the ambient temperature is increased. This implies that soak-
ing in 50°C-NH42S for 20 min is a good treatment condition.
Conclusion
The temperature-dependent dark and optical characteristics of
the InGaP/GaAs HPT with and without NH42S treatment have
been analyzed. Surface leakage has been demonstrated to signifi-
cantly impact the dark and optical performances of HPTs. In this
study, surface sulfur treatment with NH42S has effectively contrib-
uted to suppressing the undesired surface effects. And, heat could be
a catalyst for advancing the effectiveness of sulfur treatment. Treat-
ment at 50°C for 20 min is a good choice. Improvements after sul-
fur treatment include reduction of dark currents, enhancement of
optical performance, and the reduced dependence of degradation on
temperature. The treated HPT exhibits good sensitivity to low opti-
cal power and thus can be a suitable low-power photodetector for
operation in harsh climates.

Fig. 1. Schematic cross section of the fabricated DEPT with two kinds
of operation configurations. The configuration I (II) is employed for static
(dynamic) analysis.
subcollector ([Si] = 5× 1018 cm−3) was grown, followed by
a 600-nm n−-GaAs collector ([Si] = 2× 1016 cm−3). Then
a 120-nm p+-GaAs base ([C] = 2× 1019 cm−3), a 50-nm
n-In0.5Ga0.5P emitter ([Si] = 3× 1017 cm−3), a 200-nm
n+-GaAs subemitter ([Si] = 3× 1018 cm−3), a 50-nm
n+-InxGa1−xAs (x = 0−0.7) graded layer ([Te] =
2× 1019 cm−3), and, finally, a 30-nm n+-In0.7Ga0.3As
cap layer ([Te] = 2× 1019 cm−3) were deposited in sequence.
A typical triple-mesa process was used to fabricate DEPTs.
To begin with, AuGe/Ni was deposited to define the dual-
emitter formation. The emitter metals were then masked
with patterned photoresist to perform the emitter mesa
etching. The emitter mesa was defined by selectively etching
through the InGaAs (6H3PO4 : 3H2O2 : 100H2O), GaAs
(3NH4OH : 1H2O2 : 50H2O), and InGaP (1HCl : 1H3PO4)
layers [18]–[20]. After the emitter mesa formation, the
ammonia-based etchant (3NH4OH : 1H2O2 : 50H2O) was
again used to form the base and isolation mesas. Afterward,
AuGe/Ni was deposited and lifted off to be the collector
electrode. Finally, the emitter and collector ohmic contacts
were optimized by thermal annealing. The fabricated DEPT
consists of one emitter (E1) with an area of 75× 100 µm2 and
the other (E2) with an area of 150× 250 µm2. As shown in
Fig. 1, the absorption area employed is 1.1× 105 µm2.
Optical measurements were carried out by front-side illu-
mination with a 635-nm laser diode. An optical power of
Pin = 12.5 µW was used. The configuration I in Fig. 1 was
employed for measuring DEPT static performance. The E1 is
at ground state, and the E2, which is applied with a dc Vin, is
used as the control electrode. A supply voltage (VC) between
the collector and E1 is fixed at 2 V. As a dc Vin was applied, the
collector photocurrents were measured with optical injection. In
addition, included in Fig. 1 is the configuration II with a load re-
sistance (RL) that was employed for analyzing DEPT dynamic
performance. Electrooptical characteristics of the DEPT with
a series of different RLs and VCs are investigated. When the
DEPT is under illumination, a Vin of 1-V > V clock with a

frequency in the range of 1–50 kHz is applied to the E2 as an
electrical input.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Static Characteristics
Fig. 2 depicts static characteristics of the fabricated DEPT
supplied with a fixed VC of 2 V. The collector photocurrent
(ICP) measured at Vin = 0 V is 88 µA, resulting in an optical
gain ofG = 13.7. As long as a positive (negative) Vin of several
hundred millivolts is applied, the ICP and G are enhanced to
saturate at 129 (90) µA and 20 (14). A single DEPT consists
of two base-emitter junctions (the B-E1 and B-E2 junctions)
with different junction areas, a common floating base, and a
common collector. In the case of light-ON and Vin = 0 V, the
photocurrent (Iph) generated within the common base-collector
junction flows across both the B-E1 and B-E2 junctions. Since
both junctions at Vin = 0 V are equally biased, they exhibit the
same current density and, hence, the same current gain. The
DEPT now behaves as a conventional two-terminal HPT and
exhibits the lowest collector photocurrent. For a positive Vin,
the DEPT has the B-E1 junction more conductive than the B-E2
one. Therefore, an electrical dc input at the E2 modulates and
forces major portion of Iph to flow across the B-E1 junction,
resulting in a higher current density and a larger current gain.
That is, an EIGH is caused by photocurrent modulation due
to the Vin. Furthermore, an enhanced ICP due to the EIGH
from photocurrent modulation is stable. For a negative Vin, the
EIGH from photocurrent modulation similarly occurs and leads
to the enhanced conduction of the B-E2 junction. Taking the
difference in two B-E junction areas into account, DEPTs with
a negative Vin exhibit a less enhanced ICP. Dependence of the
collector-photocurrent enhancement on area ratio of the E2 to
the E1 is also in agreement with that reported previously in
[17]. Some experimental ICP’s are also tabulated in Fig. 2. It
demonstrates that the static performance of DEPTs exhibits the
stable EIGH from photocurrent modulation.

respectively. The VBa corresponding to the curve 0 is generally
equal to 1.0 V and is somewhat smaller than the VBc corre-
sponding to the curve 1. At point a, bothCBE1 andCBE2 exhibit
the same voltage as the VBa. When the Vin is suddenly changed
from 0 to 1 V, 1) IBF1 ≈ Iph and IBF2 ≈ 0 are obtained due
to the offconduction B-E2 junction, and 2) the voltage across
CBE1 is equal to the sum of the Vin and the voltage across
CBE1 due to minority-carrier accumulation effect in the base.
So the base potential is suddenly promoted to the VBb that is
much larger than the VBa at the moment of switching the Vin
from 0 to 1 V. The Vin-induced promotion of the base potential
to the VBb enhances the current gain, i.e., EIGE. Therefore,
the ICC1 obtained is much enhanced. The EIGE from junction-
voltage modulation, together with the EIGH from photocurrent
modulation, leads to an enhanced ICP and, hence, a low Vout.
However, accompanied with discharging CBE2 (and CBE1), the
VBb is decreased to the VBc, which is stable at the potential
induced by the Iph bias. The decreased base potential results in
a reduced ICP and an increased Vout. As for changing the Vin
from 1 to 0 V, on the contrary, the sudden reduction in voltage at
the E2 induces the behavior of discharging CBE1 and charging
CBE2. The charging/discharging cycle is accomplished when
the balanced base potential leads to an equal voltage drop
across the B-El and B-E2 junctions. The base potential is
decreased from VBc to VBd. It should be noted that the VBd
is too small to conduct both the B-E1 and B-E2 junctions.
Consequently, ICC1 and ICC2 are expected to be extremely
small at point d where both the B-E1 and B-E2 junctions have
low conductivities. Small ICC1 and ICC2 thus result in the much
decreased ICP. Subsequently, the base potential is increased
from VBd to VBa and stabilized due to Iph. In addition, the
Vout delay appearing during 1 to 0 V transient for a 1-kHz Vin
[shown in Fig. 3(b)] is because 1) CBE2 is larger than CBE1
and 2) the differential current gain is small in low onconduction
regime.
The Vout waveform [shown in Fig. 3(b)] for the electrooptical
switch with a 5-kHz Vin corresponds to the curves in Fig. 4(a).
As for changing the Vin from 0 to 1 V, the obtained Vout
is suddenly moved from point e (1.36 V) to point f (0.4 V).
However, the recovery process during transient cannot be com-
pleted and is ended by the following change of the Vin from
1 to 0 V. The Vout goes from point f (0.4 V) to point g
(0.69 V) and, then, is suddenly increased to point d
(1.87 V). The EIGE from junction-voltage modulation and the
EIGH from photocurrent modulation are still observed. Never-
theless, the operation is represented by the transient behavior.
For the measured Vout of the electrooptical switch with a
10-kHz Vin [shown in Figs. 3(b) and 4(a)], it is maintained
at point d (1.87V) at Vin = 0 V. It is because that finishing
the charging/discharging cycle and balancing the Vout to stable
state take longer time than half a period of Vin clock. During
the Vin-switching cycle, 0 to 1 to 0 V, the Vout moves from
point d (1.87 V) to point h (0.42 V), then to point i (0.68 V),
and, finally, to point d. In the case of a 50-kHz Vin, the
EIGE from junction-voltage modulation and the EIGH from
photocurrent modulation still take place during sudden change
in an electrical input with a short period [see waveform in
Fig. 3(b) and curves in Fig. 4(a)]. When the Vin changes from
Fig. 5. Dependence of ELH, ELL, and ELS on the frequency of a clock signal.
0 to 1 V, the Vout is decreased from point d (1.87 V) to
point j (0.5 V) and then increase until Vin switch (1 to 0 V).
It stops at point k (0.57 V) and, finally, back to point d.
The falling time and rising time are 0.9 and 2.6 µs. This
is not, altogether, disappointing when one considers that the
falling and rising times associated with the clock signal are as
large as 0.6 µs. Therefore, by scaling the emitter areas to re-
duce charging/discharging time, the response time smaller than
100 ns is expected for this DEPT.
C. Electrical-Logic Characteristics
Fig. 5 shows dependence of electrical-logic high (ELH),
electrical-logic low (ELL), and ELS on the frequency of Vin
(fclock). Refer to Fig. 3(b), points a and c are defined as the
ELH and ELL for the electrooptical switch with a 1-kHz Vin
clock. The Vouts for the electrooptical switch with 5-, 10-, and
50-kHz Vin clocks are defined to respectively have the ELL at
points g, i, and k while they exhibit the same ELH at point d.
It is found that the ELL is slightly decreased with increased
fclock. The ELH is nearly independent of fclock which is larger
than 5 kHz. Accordingly, the ELSs are determined to be 0.41,
1.18, 1.19, and 1.3 V for the Vin with 1-, 5-, 10-, and 50-kHz
clocks. Due to a clear ELS, the electrooptical switch is capable
of being a logic element. In other words, an inverter with an
electrical input can be realized. When considering dependence
of switching behaviors on area ratio of the E2 to the E1,
experimental results show that the ELS is still in the range
of 1.2–1.3 V for fclock > 5 kHz by changing the area ratio
from two to eight. This is because, in this circuit configuration,
1) the ELL by the EIGH from junction-voltage and photocur-
rent modulations are determined by the common–emitter sat-
uration voltage, and 2) the ELH is nearly equal to VC . Thus,
supply-voltage- and load-resistance-related dynamic character-
istics will be further investigated in the next sections.
D. Supply-Voltage-Related Dynamic Characteristics
To examine the operation mechanism of the electrooptical
switch proposed, other electrooptical switches with a 10-kΩ
RL and different VC’s of 1.5, 2, and 3 V are also investigated.
First of all, Fig. 6(a) shows the collector photocurrent as a
function of common–emitter E1 voltage. Curves created have
been demonstrated in accordance with experimental results of

period, the state of logic 1 (0) with a Vout of 1.12 (0.37) V
is realized when the electrooptical switch is applied with a
0-V (1-V) Vin. For a conventional integrated HPT/LD device,
the output-light power is generally dependent on the input-
light one. Moreover, only single output is available for a fixed
input-light power. In the proposed DEPT, the output-light
power can be clearly controlled by an additional electrical
input, resulting in two optical logic levels. Another pos-
sible application for this tristable-state switch is that the
light can be used to as an enable source for an electri-
cal switch. In particular, there are no other similar data re-
ported. So the proposed DEPT as an electrooptical switch
is functional, and practical circuit applications are under
proceeding.
IV. CONCLUSION
In this paper, an investigation of the static/dynamic perfor-
mance of an InGaP/GaAs DEPT as an electrooptical switch
has been addressed. A new concept of impact induced by
the emitter voltage is proposed to explain well switch be-
haviors. For DEPTs in the static case, photocurrent modula-
tion due to the change of the emitter voltage results in the
EIGH and, hence, the enhanced optical gain. For DEPTs as
an electrooptical switch, junction-voltage modulation due to
the change of the emitter voltage mainly leads to transient
behaviors, i.e., the EIGE. Reducing the period of a clock
signal is found to increase ELSs. For the switch with a 2-V
supply voltage and a 1-V/50-kHz clock signal, a clear ELS of
1.3 V is achieved. The ELS can also be improved when the
supply voltage or the load resistance is increased. However,
the increase of supply voltage increases the power consump-
tion and sharply reduces the ratio of ELS to VC . Increas-
ing load resistance is expected to extend the required device
area. According to the results obtained, the DEPT as an elec-
trooptical switch has been successfully achieved as a logic
element.

The dynamic performance of a dual-emitter phototransistor (DEPT) was studied. In the static case of a DEPT under a 12.5 mW
optical power, the emitter-induced gain eﬀect from photocurrent modulation improves collector photocurrent (88 to 129 mA).
For the DEPT as an electro-optical switch with a 2V supply voltage, the stable electrical logic swing is 0.41V for a 1V clock
signal. When a short-period clock signal is applied, a clear electrical logic swing larger than 1.2V is achieved. The emitter-
induced gain eﬀect from both photocurrent modulation and junction-voltage modulation is also introduced to clearly describe
DEPT dynamic performance. [DOI: 10.1143/JJAP.46.7705]
KEYWORDS: InGaP/GaAs, compound semiconductor, phototransistor, optical gain, logic swing
Heterojunction phototransistors (HPTs) with HBT-com-
patible technologies have received much attention in the last
two decades.1–3) The electrical gain of a conventional HPT
under low-power illumination is generally small due to a
small dc current gain. Therefore, there have been several
reports on HPTs operated with a dc base bias.4,5) The key
feature of the HPT with a dc base bias is that an additional
base current is used to push the HBT’s quiescent bias current
to a higher level where the current gain is larger.
Unfortunately, such an HPT conﬁguration also suﬀers from
an additional process with a larger device area and an
undesirable dc current being not related to the optical
injection. Recently, Tan et al. have proposed a new photo-
transistor with dual emitters (DEPT).6) Nevertheless, no
further circuit applications or detailed dynamic performance
was investigated. In this study, InGaP/GaAs DEPTs were
fabricated and employed in application to electro-optical
switching devices. When a 1V clock signal used as an
electrical input was applied to a DEPT switch under optical
injection, a dynamic response was obtained. The key
features and ﬁndings in dynamic performance including
stable and transient outputs as well as clock frequency-
related switching behaviors will be investigated and ex-
plained by a newly proposed concept called the emitter-
induced gain eﬀect (EIGE).
The DEPT structure studied was grown on a semi-
insulating GaAs substrate by metal organic chemical vapor
deposition. It consists of a 600 nm nþ-GaAs subcollector
(½Si ¼ 5 1018 cm3), a 600 nm n-GaAs collector (½Si ¼
2 1016 cm3), a 120 nm pþ-GaAs base (½C ¼ 2 1019
cm3), a 50 nm n-In0:5Ga0:5P emitter (½Si ¼ 3 1017
cm3), a 200 nm nþ-GaAs subemitter (½Si ¼ 3 1018
cm3), a 50 nm nþ-InxGa1xAs (x ¼ 0{0:7) graded layer
(½Te ¼ 2 1019 cm3), and ﬁnally a 30 nm nþ-In0:7Ga0:3As
cap layer (½Te ¼ 2 1019 cm3). The triple-mesa process
was used to fabricate DEPTs. AuGe/Ni was deposited to
form two emitters. After ﬁnishing the fabrication of the dual-
emitter and base mesas, AuGe/Ni was again deposited and
simultaneously annealed to form the dual-emitter and
collector electrodes. The DEPT exhibits one emitter (E1)
area of 75 100 mm2, another emitter (E2) area of 150
250 mm2, and an absorption area of 1:1 105 mm2. Optical
measurements were carried out by front-side illumination
with a 635 nm laser diode. An optical power of Pin ¼
12:5 mW was employed. The inset in Fig. 1 shows the circuit
conﬁguration used for measuring DEPT static performance
similarly to that reported by Tan et al.6) Shown in the inset
of Fig. 2 is the circuit diagram for measuring DEPT dynamic
performance. The load resistance (RC) and supply voltage
(VCC) are 10 k and 2V, respectively. When the DEPT is

light-on case, the EIGE from photocurrent modulation and
junction-voltage modulation still takes place during a sudden
change in electrical input. When Vclock is suddenly changed
from 0 to 1V, the output is changed from line 4 (point D)
to line 5 (point E) and then to line 6 (point F) [seen in
Fig. 3(b)]. In other words, the recovery during transient
cannot be completed and is ended by the following change in
Vclock. Therefore, a clear electrical logic swing larger than
1.2V is obtained.
Experimental results including static/dynamic perform-
ance were reported on InGaP/GaAs DEPTs as electro-
optical switching devices. Photocurrent modulation between
two emitters results in current-gain enhancement and
improves the optical performance of the DEPT in the static
case. For the DEPT as an electro-optical switch with a 2V
supply voltage and a 1V clock signal input, a clear electrical
logic swing larger than 1.2V is achieved. Furthermore, a
newly proposed concept deﬁned as the emitter-induced gain
eﬀect from photocurrent modulation and junction-voltage
modulation explains well both DEPT static and dynamic
performance.

([C] = 4 1019 cm3), a 30 nm n-In0:5Ga0:5P emitter
([Si] = 3 1017 cm3), a 200 nm nþ-GaAs subemitter
([Si] = 3 1018 cm3), a 50 nm nþ-InxGa1xAs (x ¼ 0{
0:7) graded layer ([Te] = 2 1019 cm3), and a 50 nm nþ-
In0:7Ga0:3As cap layer ([Te] = 2 1019 cm3) were grown
in turn. Various types of HPTs were fabricated using a triple-
mesa process. To begin with, the emitter mesa was deﬁned
by selectively etching through the InGaAs (6H3PO4:3H2O2:
100H2O), GaAs (3NH4OH:1H2O2:50H2O), and InGaP
(1HCl:1H3PO4) layers. After emitter mesa formation,
the ammonia-based etchant (3NH4OH:1H2O2:50H2O) was
again used to form base and isolation mesas. Three sets
of HPTs (HPTs A, B, and C), separated from the same
fabricated chip, were prepared. HPT A denotes an unpassi-
vated HPT without sulfur treatment. HPT B was rinsed with
1HF:8H2O solution for 1min and then submerged in diluted
(NH4)2S solution [3(NH4)2S:2H2O, pH ¼ 9:9] at 50 C for
15min. For HPT C, the treatment process was similar to
that used for HPT B, but the solution was changed to
neutralized (NH4)2S [3(NH4)2S:2HCl, pH ¼ 7]. Both the
diluted (NH4)2S and neutralized (NH4)2S solutions were
of 12% S weight concentration. The pH values remained
relatively stable during treatment. Afterward, all of the
fabricated HPTs were simultaneously deposited with AuGe-
Ni as emitter and collector contacts. Emitter and collector
n-type ohmic contacts were optimized using a hot plate at
320 C for 20 s. For the base contact, AuZn was used. Each
of the fabricated HPTs was designed to have an emitter area
of 75 60 mm2 and an absorption area of 1:1 105 mm2. For
temperature-dependent dark and optical measurements, a
semiconductor parameter analyzer combined with a light
source module and a hot chuck system was used. The light
source module consists of a 635 nm laser diode and an
optical power meter. Front-side illumination measurements
at diﬀerent levels of optical power (Pin) were performed.
Moreover, the measurements were carried out in a black
shielding box to prevent noise and undesired illumination.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1 Room-temperature characteristics of HPTs
Shown in Fig. 2(a) are Gummel plots of the fabricated
HPTs at 298K in the dark. It was found that the base
currents of both HPTs B and C occurred at a low-VBE
regime, as compared with that of HPT A. This is attributed
to the retardation of the surface recombination eﬀect
induced by passivation treatment. The lowest base current
at the low-VBE regime was observed for HPT C. This
indicates that the highest-quality passivated surface can be
achieved using the neutralized (NH4)2S solution. The
dependence of the instantaneous ideality factor (B) of base
current on the base–emitter voltage is also included in
Fig. 2(a). The B values of HPTs B and C were found to be
smaller than that of HPT A for the measured VBE, in which
HPT C exhibits the lowest value. The minimum B values
are 1.19, 1.12, and 1.11 for HPTs A, B, and C, respectively.
When the B of HPT A increases with a decrease in VBE and
reaches 2 at a VBE of 0.94V, it is only 1.42 (1.45) for HPT C
(B). Figure 2(b) shows the DC current gain () as a function
of the base current for the HPTs in the dark at 298K. The
base current at which  ¼ 1 has been reduced by more than
one order of magnitude following the diluted (NH4)2S and
neutralized (NH4)2S passivation treatments. In addition,
the  values are increased by the passivation treatment,
particularly at the low-base-current regime. The saturation
value of  is 87 (85) for HPT C (B), while it is 78 for
HPT A. Evidently, the  of HPT C was found to be largest
at any base current.

ciently into the eﬀective absorption region of the passivated
HPTs. Few impediments take place on the exposed base
surface, and the recombination of the generated electron–
hole pairs due to the surface potential is reduced. In addition,
a thicker sulﬁde-compound-passivated surface with few
etching pits also beneﬁts the eﬃcient optical absorption
and the generation of p–i–n photocurrent (Iph) for HPT C.
Therefore, HPT C exhibits the highest Iph at any light input
power. HPT C is more sensitive to low-power illumination
than the other HPTs.
Figure 4(a) shows the room-temperature collector dark
current (ICdark) as a function of the collector–emitter voltage
(VCE) for all the fabricated HPTs with a ﬂoating base. The
ICdark of HPT A (B) at a VCE of 1V is 0.59 (0.03) nA, while
that of HPT C is only 0.89 pA. HPT C exhibits the lowest
ICdark. The ICdark diﬀerence between HPT A (B) and C is
more than three orders (one order) of magnitude. It is noted
that the dark performance of the p–i–n region markedly
inﬂuences the HPT dark performance. Figure 4(b) shows the
room-temperature collector photocurrent current (ICP) as a
function of collector–emitter voltage (VCE) for the fabricated
HPTs in the ﬂoating-base conﬁguration at diﬀerent levels
of light input power. Collector photocurrent (ICP) can be
expressed as24)
ICP ¼ ðIph þ IdarkÞ½ðIB ¼ Iph þ Idark;TÞ þ 1; ð6Þ
where the temperature-dependent DC current gain is
associated with the sum of p–i–n dark current (Idark) and
photocurrent (Iph). The p–i–n dark current (Idark) and the p–
i–n photocurrent (Iph) of a HPT serve as the biasing currents,
similarly to how base current functions in a HBT. The
measured ICP saturating at 1.16 mA for HPT C at a Pin of
107.6 nW corresponds to a  (IB  Iph ¼ 29:7 nA, 298K) of
38. This value is in good agreement with that shown in the
 vs IB curve in Fig. 2(b). The Idark at 298K is negligible
(IB  Iph) in this case because it is less than the measured Iph
(Pin ¼ 107:6 nW) by more than three orders of magnitude.
At a VCE of 1V, the obtained ICP values of HPT C (B) at
298K are 32 (27), 87 (70), and 281 (235) nA and, 1.16
(1.01) mA, while those of HPT A are 1.8, 3.2, 11, and 79 nA
for at Pin values of 8.3, 15.6, 36, and 107.6 nW, respectively.
The prominent enhancement of ICP obtained for the
passivated HPTs can be attributed to the enhanced p–i–n
photocurrent (Iph) combined with the promoted DC current
gain () after passivation treatment.
3.2 Temperature-dependent characteristics of HPTs
Temperature has been considered as a major factor
inﬂuencing the reliability of electronic equipment. It is also
a factor of increasing dark current. Figure 5(a) shows the
temperature-dependent p–i–n dark current at VBC ¼ 0:5V.
In the range of T of 298 to 448K, the measured p–i–n dark
currents for HPTs A, B, and C are in the ranges of 2.61 to
256 nA, 0.05 to 2.39 nA, and 2 pA to 0.55 nA, respectively.
A substantial decrease in p–i–n dark current has been
achieved for the passivated HPTs (HPTs B and C). The Idark
of HPT A at 448K is more than two orders of magnitude
larger than those of HPTs B and C. As shown in the inset,
the Idark of HPT A at 398K reaches 18.9 nA, while those
at 398K are only 0.2 and 0.03 nA for HPTs B and C,

4.79) at 298K (448K) for Pin values of 8.3 to 107.6 nW. The
diﬀerence between HPT C and HPT A at a Pin of 8.3 (107.6)
and 298K is presented to be near a factor of 30 (15). At
448K, a value higher than 20-fold (5-fold) the G of HPT A
is observed for HPT C at a Pin of 8.3 (107.6) nW. Clearly, a
much improved p–i–n photocurrent (Iph) biases HPT C at a
more desirable operating point.
The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a signiﬁcant index to
examine the output signal quality of electronic and optoelec-
tronic systems. To investigate the reliability of the measured
p–i–n current and collector current, we deﬁne the SNR (dB)
as
SNR ¼ 20 log Iph
Idark
 
for the p{i{n region of HPT ð9Þ
or
SNR ¼ 20 log ICP
ICdark
 
for HPT: ð10Þ
Figure 8(a) shows the temperature-dependent SNR of the p–
i–n current at a VBC of 0:5V. The SNR values of the p–i–n
current for HPT A at a Pin of 8.3 nW and 298 to 448K are
7:7 to 47 dB, while those are positively increased to 15 to
25 dB for a Pin of 107.6 nW. The negative SNR values
indicate that the Idark values are higher than the generated Iph
values. Although the Pin increases to 107.6 nW, a negative
SNR is still exhibited for HPT A at high temperatures. By
diluted (NH4)2S treatment, the SNR values can be enhanced
to 33 to 0:7 (55–22) dB for HPT B at a Pin of 8.3 (107.6)
nW and 298 to 448K. The negative SNR is only observed
at 448K when Pin is as low as 8.3 nW. After treatment with
the neutralized (NH4)2S solution, HPT C thus exhibits the
advanced enhancement. The SNR values are 62 to 12 (84 to
35) dB at 298 to 448K for a Pin of 8.3 (107.6) nW. No
negative SNR values are observed. In the ﬂoating-emitter
conﬁguration, the Idark dominates the operation of HPT A at
a low Pin and a high temperature while the operation of
HPT C is dominated by the photocurrent. Figure 8(b) shows
the temperature-dependent SNR of the collector current. The
SNR values for HPT A at a Pin of 8.3 nW and 298 to 448K
are 5.9 to 65 dB, while those positively increase to 42 to
18 dB for a Pin of 107.6 nW. Although the Pin increases to
107.6 nW, a negative SNR is still exhibited for HPT A at
high temperatures. The markedly improved SNR values of
HPT B at a Pin of 8.3 (107.6) nW and 298 to 448K are 59 to
3:4 (91 to 32) dB. HPT C exhibits the best SNR values.
The SNR values are 91 to 10 (122 to 48) dB at 298 to 448
for a Pin of 8.3 (107.6) nW. All of the SNR values obtained
for HPT C are positive. HPT C at a Pin of 8.3 nW and 298K
exhibits the SNR values higher than twofold that of HPT A
at a higher Pin of 107.6 nW. Accordingly, HPT C can be a
reliable optical switch for application in low-power photo-
detction. However, HPT A is not able to exhibit clear on/oﬀ
states for low-power illumination when the ambient temper-
ature is increased. The eﬀectiveness of neutralized (NH4)2S
treatment has been demonstrated.
3.3 Long-term stability of HPTs
The key to the successful use of electronic devices is high-
level reliability with long-term stability. The long-term
stability of the improved dark and optical performance for
the passivated HPTs is determined by the passivation
durability. That is, a long-term stable passivation is required.
In order to examine the durability, we exposed HPTs A, B,
and C to air at a relative humidity of 70% and room
temperature for three weeks. Figure 9(a) shows the collector
dark current measured immediately after fabrication at
298K and that measured after three-week air exposure. The
ICdark (VCE ¼ 1V) of 1.14 nA for HPT A after three weeks is
about twofold that of the as fabricated result. The ICdark of
1.62 pA (0.22 nA) for HPT C (B) after three weeks is about

passivation. These are due to the formation of a thicker
sulﬁde compound with few etching pits. The HPT with a
good detectivity under low-power illumination and with
a long-term stable passivation is considered to be very
promising for an alternative low-power photodetector in
harsh climates.
