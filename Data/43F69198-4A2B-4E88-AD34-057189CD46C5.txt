simple structure, easy control and easy maintenance, 
etc. The semiconductor, pharmaceutical, food, and 
textile industries use pneumatic cylinders as 
important mechanical components. Many 
manufacturers request pneumatic cylinders operate 
in a non-polluted surrounding. The greases are 
substituted for lubricant and lubricator in pneumatic 
cylinders. The friction force increases with velocity 
and pressure, as can be expected [17]. The seal and 
cylinder bore greatly affect the friction force of 
pneumatic cylinders [18]. This study focuses on 
reducing the friction force of pneumatic cylinders 
using nanoparticles as grease additives. The 
experiments, examined the tribological properties of 
greases with and without nickel nanoparticles. The 
friction force of the pneumatic cylinder test 
equipment was employed to evaluate the friction 
reduction abilities of nickel nanoparticles. The 
experimental results of various operating conditions 
were compared. To evaluate the results repeatability, 
extensive experimentation was carried out, applying 
different acting velocities and greases (0.5wt%, 
1.0wt%, 2.0wt% Ni grease and base lithium grease). 
 
II. EXPERIMENTAL 
This study examined the effect of nanoparticles 
on the friction force reduction of lithium grease in a 
pneumatic cylinder. Ni nanoparticles were provided 
by Yong-Zhen Techno-material Co. LTD. The results 
of XRD and SEM examinations are shown in Fig. 
1and Fig. 2. Fig. 2 can be seen the Ni nanoparticles 
are circular. The structure of the synthesized 
nanoparticles was analyzed by XRD (Philips 
X’pert-MPD system) with a Cu Kα radiation source 
(λ=0.1541838nm). The average diameter of nickel 
nanoparticles is 93.37 nm. The size distribution of 
the nickel nanoparticles can be seen in Fig. 3. The 
base grease is LB80102 lithium grease made by 
CPC Corporation. The properties of the base grease 
used in the experiment are shown in Table 1. 
The synthesis of nano Ni greases was as follows. 
The concentrations of the nanoparticle were set at 
0.5, 1.0 and 2wt%. Ethanol was employed as a 
dispersant. The Ni nanoparticles and base grease 
were mixed by a stirrer in ethanol solution. The 
nanoparticles were dispersed in the mixed solution 
using an ultrasonic probe for 30 min. This 
preparation method of suspensions was used to 
break up the agglomeration. Then, the mixed 
solution was stirred for 2 hours. In the stirred 
process, the ethanol was evaporated in the constant 
temperature water trough at 30℃. The stirred 
equipment is shown in Fig. 4. 
The test setup, schematically represented in Fig. 
5, simulates the behavior of a system consisting of a 
piston and seal sliding inside a cylinder bore. It 
consists of the pneumatic cylinders being tested and 
their respective valves and sensors. Four sensors 
were set up to measure the position, velocity, and 
pressure of both chambers of the pneumatic cylinder, 
as well as the force. Three variables, the rod velocity 
and the pressures of both chambers of the pneumatic 
cylinder, were controlled and kept constant. In this 
test system, the motion of the pneumatic cylinder (B) 
is driven by the action of the pneumatic cylinder (A) 
independent of the pressure difference in its 
chambers. The pressure of the air compressor unit is 
set at 10 kPa, providing enough force to actuate a 
pneumatic cylinder (B). On the right, a load cell was 
fixed on the wall and connected with the rod of the 
pneumatic cylinder (B) to measure the friction force 
between the seal and the cylinder bore of the 
pneumatic cylinder (B). Three sensors were set up to 
measure the position, velocity, and pressure of both 
chambers of the pneumatic cylinder (A). In the test, 
three variables, the rod velocity and the pressures of 
both chambers of the pneumatic cylinder (A), were 
controlled and kept constant by the throttle valves 
and pressure regulator valves. The piston seal and 
the bore of the pneumatic cylinder (B) were tested 
under different greases lubricated conditions. 
In this study, five variables are measured during 
 5 
          2211 ApApFp −=     (4) 
where p1, p2 represent pressures in the two cylinder 
chambers of cylinder (A), and A1, A2 are the 
corresponding piston areas. The results of Ff 
compared with the measured data of Flc under base 
Li grease lubricating are shown in Fig 8. The results 
of Ff and Flc are conformity. It means the friction 
force measure system can provide precise and 
accurate data of friction force. 
Motion is caused by the force exerted by the 
driving pneumatic cylinder. The test measured each 
seal under both dry and lubricated conditions. Each 
test included two processes – the extended process 
and retracted process. In accordance with the role 
played by pressure during the effective cylinder 
operation, the chamber that emptied during the 
motion was defined as the resistance chamber, and 
the other was defined as the driving chamber. In the 
extended process, the driving pressure was set to 
6kPa and the relative pressure at the resistance (front) 
chamber was raised to 7 kPa before the pneumatic 
cylinder (a) was started. Before the retracted process 
began, the relative pressure at the resistance (rear) 
chamber was kept at 6 kPa and the driving pressure 
was set to 6kPa to drive the pneumatic cylinder (a). 
The operation settings of pressure in both chambers 
make the motion of the pneumatic cylinder stable.  
Under each experimental condition, the friction 
force was measured for velocities between 3 and 300 
mm/s; the velocities were set at 3, 5, 8, 10, 15, 25, 
35, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 mm/s. Tests 
were carried out for both directions of the piston. 
The direction is called ‘extended’ when the piston 
moves from the rear cover to the front cover of the 
cylinder, while it is called ‘retracted’ when the 
piston moves in the opposite direction. 
The use of more accurate friction models to 
compensation in control system is necessary if more 
sophisticated control strategies are applied, if 
application needs precision positioning or if 
actuators with worse friction characteristics are 
employed. In this way, Perondi (2002) represents 
friction in pneumatic servo actuators by the LuGre 
model (Eq. 4), that is used also to friction 
compensation. 
In this study, the experiment includes two steps. 
The first step is to synthesize different proportions 
of the Nano-Ni greases. The components of grease 
additives were analyzed by XRD. Scanning electron 
microscope (SEM) was used to observe the structure 
of the grease additives. In the second step, the 
friction force of the pneumatic cylinder 
measurement system was employed to measure the 
friction force between the seal and cylinder bore 
with Nano-Ni greases. The base lithium greases and 
Nano-Ni grease were used to lubricate the contact 
interface between the seal and cylinder bore in the 
pneumatic cylinder. The purpose of this work is to 
study the tribological behaviors of the Ni 
nanoparticles as grease additives using a pneumatic 
cylinder friction tester. 
 
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The friction force was calculated according to 
Eq. (2) from the load cell responses. Fig. 9 shows 
the distribution of the static friction forces along the 
cylinder. The results are shown for extended motion 
of the piston at 3, 5, 8, 10, 15, 25, 35, 50, 100, and 
200mm/s. Fig. 9 shows how the static friction force 
of the seals was distributed under different velocity 
settings and lubricating conditions. It shows the 
static friction forces of greases with Ni nanoparticles 
are all smaller than that of pure lubricating grease. 
Fig. 9 proves when the additive concentration of Ni 
nanoparticles was 1.0 wt%, the lubricant grease has 
the best anti-friction performance. The average static 
friction force was 36.6N at the base grease 
lubricated condition. When the nano Ni grease 
(1.0wt %) was applied in the pneumatic cylinder, the 
average static friction force was 28.1N. The average 
static friction force was reduced by 22%. When the 
 7 
32N under the base grease lubricated condition. The 
friction forces of the pneumatic cylinder under the 
1.0 wt% nano Ni grease lubricated condition at high 
velocity operation were obviously smaller than that 
under the base grease lubricated condition. 
Moreover, Fig. 14 (b) shows the dynamic 
characteristic of the friction force of the pneumatic 
cylinder was the most stable under the 1.0 wt% nano 
Ni grease lubricated condition. The fluctuation of 
the friction force of the pneumatic cylinder under the 
1.0 wt% nano Ni grease lubricated condition was 
steady at 200mm/s. The results show the the 1.0 
wt% nano Ni grease had the best lubricating 
characteristics for pneumatic cylinder at high 
velocity operation. 
 
IV.  CONCLUSIONS 
In this study, nano Ni greases were successfully 
prepared. When used as a lubricant additive in 
lithium grease, it can effectively improve the 
lubricating properties of lithium grease. The nano Ni 
grease can prevent the stick-slip motion of 
pneumatic cylinders at low velocity operation and 
steady the piston motion at high velocity operation. 
The optimum concentration of Ni nanoparticle as 
additive is 1.0 wt%. This work research the 
lubricating characteristic of nano Ni greases for 
pneumatic cylinder and developed a friction force 
measurement system. Greases with 0.5 wt%, 1.0 
wt% and 2.0 wt% Ni nanoparticles were tested in 
this study. The results show the friction force varies 
according to the piston position under different 
velocity operations. From the measurement tests, the 
friction characteristics and their relationships with 
velocity were experimentally clarified.  
According to the results, the friction forces of 
pneumatic cylinder were significantly reduced by 
nano Ni grease. The results show the dynamic 
characteristic of piston motion under the 1.0 wt% 
nano Ni grease lubricated condition was the 
steadiest at low and high velocity operations. The 
results of the experiment provide engineers with a 
method to test different greases lubrications and 
understand the dynamic characteristics of the 
friction force of pneumatic cylinders under different 
velocity operations. The obtained data will be useful 
in developing a suitable friction model, and the 
experimental apparatus will facilitate the study of 
the effects of different lubricants on friction force.
