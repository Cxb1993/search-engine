Abstract 
 
This project is to dedicate to the study 
of novel ultra-wide band (UWB) antennas. In 
2002, Federal Communications Commission 
(FCC) released the UWB system whose 
spectrum covers from 3.1 GHz to 10.6 GHz. 
UWB antennas have received great attention 
in the electromagnetic community. Some 
people use trial and error approach to design 
antennas. However, the drawbacks of this 
approach are that obtained results are not 
satisfactory and the optimal after a large 
number of experiments. In this project, 
Taguchi’s method, a new global optimizer, 
will be used for optimizing the antennas. A 
full wave electromagnetic analyzer based on 
method of moments, IE3D, will be adopted 
to analyze the antennas. Taguchi’s method 
and IE3D are integrated with each other to 
get the optimal performance of the UWB 
antennas with and/or without band-stop 
feature by automatic optimization procedure. 
Research results obtained from this project 
and the proposed design procedure could be 
used to serve as a useful reference for 
designers working in the field of antenna 
design. 
 
Keywords: coplanar waveguide,

二、前言 
 
 自 2002年美國聯邦通信委員會（FCC）
宣布超寬頻(ultra-wideband, UWB) 系統之
頻譜（3.1 GHz 到 10.6 GHz）後，超寬頻天
線在電磁領域中受到許多人的重視。近年
來超寬頻天線已陸續被許多人設計並且相
關之研究已發表在期刊上。在這些超寬頻
天線中，有些是非平面型結構 [1-3]，如
圖一所示，其接地面是垂直於天線輻射元
 4
為了解決上述問題，在本計劃中我們
將 提 出 一 種 曡 代 式 田 口 法 (iterative 
Taguchi’s method，以下簡稱田口法)來做為
一種全局最佳化演算法(global optimization 
algorithm)並且結合全波(full wave)電磁套
裝軟體 IE3D 來設計超寬頻天線。個人過去
數年發展疊代式田口法並成功地應用於微
波被動濾波器設計及天線陣列合成等問題
上。至目前為止皆能得到不錯的全局優化
結果。因此，期待藉由本計劃之執行，能
設計出不僅能滿足 UWB 系統的超寬頻天
線而且天線具有價格低、尺寸小等優點。 
 
四、文獻探討 
 
在超寬頻系統上有一些頻段已經被其
他無線通信所使用，如無線網路 (Wireless 
Local-Area Network, WLAN) 
IEEE802.11a，它操作頻段是在 5 GHz – 6 
GHz 的頻段 [9]。因為 5 GHz – 6 GHz 的
頻已被無線網路所使用，為了避免相互干
擾，所以我們設計了一個截止頻帶來阻隔 
5 GHz – 6 GHz 的無線網路頻段。而本篇研
究我們提出了一個以微帶線饋入的超寬頻
天線，然後結合 5.5 GHz (5 GHz – 6 GHz) 
的截止頻帶特性來設計此天線。由前面可
知美國聯邦通信委員會定訂了超寬頻的頻
段為 3.1GHz ~ 10.6 GHz，在這麼高的頻寬
下設計超寬頻天線需要幾項要求，第一，
需要良好的阻抗匹配其反射係數在 
3.1GHz ~ 10.6 GHz 之間需要小於 -10dB。
第二，超寬頻天線在 3.1GHz ~ 10.6 GHz
之 間 需 要 有 全 方 向 性 的 場 型 
(omnidirectional pattern)。第三，超寬頻天
線設計天來的尺寸盡量越小越好，以配合
無線系統小型化的目標。 
 
 
五、研究方法 
   
田口法是以直交表(orthogonal array)為
基礎的一種最佳化方法。在設計的過程
中，運用田口法能有效地減少試驗的次
數。直交表的理論基礎是由統計學而來
[10]，直交表在田口法中扮演著非常重要的
角色。表一所示為一直交表之例子，其具
有 3個水準(level)、2個強度(strength)，提

供四個受控參數(parameter)的直交表，其符
號為 OA(9, 4, 3, 2)。如果運用此直交表進
行實驗，則只需 9 個試驗次數即可找出接
近全局優化的結果。因此，運用直交表之
實驗為部份因子實驗法的一種。然而，若
運用全因子實驗法，則相同的問題需要做
34 ( = 81) 次試驗才能得到相似的優化結
果。所以運用直交表可有效地減少設計過
程中所需的時間及實驗材料等成本。

結果顯示在圖七。根據 IEEE 802.11a 得知
無線網路所使用的頻段為  5 GHz – 6 
GHz，所以我們在這超寬頻天線上增加了
一個槽孔式的截止頻帶設計 (稱做天線 
2 )，其結構圖顯示在圖八，有效的阻斷在 5

0.6 mm、 W6 = 8.0 mm 、 W7 = 1.5 mm 和 
W8 = 7.0 mm。其中天線 2 的接地面比天
線 1 的接地面大。天線 2 接地面的尺寸
大小為 L1 = 20.5 mm 、 L2 = 7.5 mm 、 
W1 = 32.0 mm 和 W4 = 11.0 mm。其它的
尺寸都跟天線1一樣。天線 1 與天線 2 所
模擬的駐波比的曲線圖顯示在圖六做比

設計而有所不同。 
本研究提出一個新月形的平面天線分
別有截止頻帶與無截止頻帶之設計。分別

天線。可以看的出截止頻帶之設計成功的

Introduction 
 
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) first adopted ultra-wideband 
(UWB) for short-range peer-to peer ultra-fast communication [1]. The design and 
implementation of UWB system has become a popular topic in both academy and 
industry communities of telecommunications. In particular, as an important 
component of the UWB system, a broad band antenna will be launched in the 
frequency range from 3.1 GHz – 10.6 GHz, which has attracted immense research 
power in the recent years [2]. In the UWB system, there are some other existing 
narrowband services that already occupy frequencies in the UWB band, such as 
wireless local-area network (WLAN) IEEE 802.11a and HIPERLAN/2 WLAN 
operating in the 5 GHz – 6 GHz band [3]. It is desired to design the UWB antenna 
with notched frequency bands 5 GHz – 6 GHz to minimize the interferences 
between the UWB system and narrowband systems. This paper proposes a 
microstrip fed planar UWB antenna with band-notched characteristics in 5.5 GHz 
(5 GHz – 6 GHz). 
 
The proposed antenna size is 28.0 mm by 39.5 mm, which is fed by a 50 ohms 
microstrip with width 1.5 mm, a crescent-shape patch, and a partially modified 
ground plane. The band-notched feature is achieved by a nested slot in the 
crescent-shape radiating patch. The crescent-shape antenna yields an impedance 
bandwidth of 2.8 GHz – 11.0 GHz with VSWR < 2, which covers the UWB 
spectrum (3.1 GHz – 10.6 GHz), except the bandwidths 5 GHz – 6 GHz of IEEE 
802.11a and HIPERLAN/2 WLAN systems. Details of the antenna design are 
presented, and simulated results of voltage standing-wave ratio (VSWR), 
radiation pattern, current distribution and antenna gain are given, and discussed. 
 
Antenna Designs and Results 
 
Fig. 1 shows the geometry of the UWB antenna. The antenna (denoted as Antenna 
1 in this paper) is fabricated on an FR4 substrate with substrate height H = 0.8 
mm, dielectric constant 4.4, and loss tangent 0.01. In Fig. 1, the crescent-shape 
patch is fed by a 50 ohms microstrip. Simulation is performed by a MoM-based 
full-wave electromagnetic software, Zeland IE3D. The dimensions of the antenna 
are W1 = 28.0 mm, W2 = 1.5 mm, W3 = 13.5 mm, W4 = 9.0 mm, W5 = 26.0 mm, 
L1 = 20.0 mm, L2 = 7.0 mm, L3 = 4.0 mm, L4 = 19.0 mm, and R = 14.0 mm. A

In this study, a one-element coplanar-waveguide (CPW) slot antenna and a two-element series aperiodic CPW slot antenna array
are optimized by Taguchi’s method, in conjunction with a full-wave simulator to analyze the antennas, to achieve the desired goals. As
a comparison, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is also used to design the two antennas. Optimization results show that the desired
frequency responses of the antenna are successfully achieved by the two approaches. The optimization results from the Taguchi’s method
significantly outperformed the PSO method in these two slot-antenna configurations.
Index Terms—Coplanar waveguide (CPW), optimization techniques, particle swarm optimization (PSO), slot antennas, Taguchi
method.
I. INTRODUCTION
P ARTICLE swarm optimization (PSO) [1] is an evolu-tionary computational algorithm and has received great
attention [2]. Recently, another novel global optimization
technique, Taguchi’s method [3], was introduced to the elec-
tromagnetic (EM) community [4], and successfully optimized
some EM applications, such as linear array synthesis [5],
ultra-wideband (UWB) antenna [6], and planar filter designs
[7], which demonstrated its great potential on optimization
and its advantages of solving complex problem ability, good
convergence, and easy coding. In this study, a one-element
coplanar-waveguide (CPW) slot antenna and a two-element
series aperiodic CPW slot-antenna array [8] are optimized by
Taguchi’s method and PSO, where a full-wave simulator IE3D,
based on the method of moments, is used to analyze the an-
tennas and is integrated with the two optimization approaches.
The design objectives are that the optimized one-element
antenna has a single resonant frequency at 5 GHz while the
two-element antenna has a dual-resonant frequency feature at
5 GHz and 6 GHz. Moreover, by optimizing the antenna under
the same optimization conditions, the performance of the two
optimization approaches can be compared with each other. The
two slot antennas serve as the examples of a different degree
of complexity for comparison. Optimization results show that
the desired frequency responses of the antenna are successfully
obtained by the two approaches. The result shows that the
superior optimization performance of Taguchi’s method makes
it a viable alternative optimization scheme for EM applications.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the concept
of Taguchi’s method and PSO is described. Section III discusses
two designs of CPW slot antennas: a single-frequency antenna
and a dual-frequency antenna, and each design using Taguchi’s
method and PSO are also described. Section IV demonstrates
optimized results of each antenna designed by the proposed
Taguchi’s optimization approach including the optimization
performance comparison between Taguchi’s method and PSO.

II. OPTIMIZATION APPROACH, TAGUCHI’S METHOD, AND PSO
A. Taguchi’s Method
Taguchi’s method was developed based on the concept of or-
thogonal array (OA), which can effectively reduce the number
of tests required in a design process [4]. Taguchi’s method pro-
vides an efficient way to determine the optimal parameters in
an optimization process. The notation OA is used to
represent rows by columns (for parameters) OA with
levels and strengths. OAs have important properties, such as
fractional factorial characteristics, balanced and fair character-
istics, and orthogonality. The main advantage of utilizing an OA
to deal with a problem is that only experiments are needed
to find a better combination of the parameter values. However,
experiments are needed if one uses a full factorial strategy to
deal with the same problem. Obviously, the number of experi-
ments is dramatically reduced since is much larger than .
The procedure of iterative Taguchi’s method starts with the
problem initialization, including definitions of solution space,
fitness function, and selecting a proper OA. If parameters
are to be optimized, the selected OA should be larger than or
equal to . Typically, a three-level OA with a strength of two is
adopted in order to characterize nonlinear effects of a problem.
If , the rest of the columns are simply ignored without af-
fecting the orthogonality of the OA since the columns in an OA
are independent of one another.
After determining the corresponding values for the levels of
each input parameter, experiments are conducted and their fit-
ness values are calculated as well. The corresponding signal-to-
noise ratio (SNR) of each fitness value can be obtained by
the following equation [3]:
Fitness (1)
Therefore, a smaller fitness value results in a larger . The en-
tries of the response table can be determined by the following
equation [4]:
(2)
where is the th level and is the th parameter. Hence,
is an average of of the th parameter for all level- .
The optimal level values of each parameter can be identified by
the corresponding level of the maximum . A confirmation test

During each iteration, the best fitness value is updated if a fitness
value is better than the previous one. The design goal is taken as
at (7)
Since there are four parameters , and to be opti-
mized, an OA(9, 4, 3, 2) [11] which offers nine rows for nine
simulations and four columns for four parameters is adopted in
Taguchi’s optimization. In PSO, nine particles (rows) and four
parameters (columns) are also used for fair comparison. The so-
lution space (unit: mm) is defined as
and
During optimization, the dimensions of the proposed antenna
are modified to improve the impedance match at a resonant fre-
quency of 5 GHz.
B. Two-Element Series Aperiodic Slot-Antenna Array
The geometry of the two-element series aperiodic slot-an-
tenna array is shown in Fig. 2. The dimensions (
to 2) and of the antenna are the same as those of the one-el-
ement antenna. The initial interval between elements is 23 mm.
and are offset values of the slot elements. If the offset
value is positive, the slot element moves toward the right-hand
side. The fitness function is defined as

The reflection coefficient at each desired resonant frequency
has equal priority in the fitness function, which can be seen as
a dual-objective fitness function. The fitness function shown in
(8) is used in Taguchi’s method and PSO for fair comparison.
The design goal is taken as
at and (9)
Since there are nine parameters and , to be
optimized, an OA(27, 9, 3, 2) [11], which offers 27 rows for 27
simulations and nine columns for nine parameters, is adopted in
Taguchi’s optimization. In PSO, 27 particles (rows) and nine
parameters (columns) are also used for fair comparison. The
solution space (units in millimeters) is defined as

During the optimization process, the dimensions of the proposed
antenna are modified to improve the impedance match at reso-
nant frequencies 5 GHz and 6 GHz.
IV. OPTIMIZED RESULTS
In the case of the one-element slot-antenna optimization, only
eight iterations are required to meet the design goal shown in
(7) by using Taguchi’s method as shown in the fitness curves in
Fig. 3. However, 45 iterations are required by using PSO to meet
the same design goal. The fitness curve of Taguchi’s method
decreases sharply, but the fitness curve of PSO is flat between
10 and 20 iterations and 22 to 39 iterations, which means that no
optimization improvement is obtained during those iterations.
The dimensions of the one-element slot antenna optimized by
the two approaches are shown in Table I. The return losses of
the optimized antenna by Taguchi’s method and PSO are shown

Abstract —NCNU is the abbreviation of our university, 
National Chi Nan University. This paper proposes a 
planar antenna with an NCNU shape. The proposed 
antenna is composed by a 50 ohms microstrip, a unique 
and meaningful shape patch, and a ground plane. The 
antenna is investigated by both simulation and 
measurement. We use trial-and-error approach and 
particle swarm optimization in conjunction with method 
of moments to design the proposed antenna to get the 
better performance. The bandwidth and resonant 
frequency of the proposed antenna are mainly affected 
by the NCNU-shaped radiating patch and the 
rectangular ground plane. Simulation and optimization 
results show that the antenna exhibits four main 
resonances around 1.75 GHz, 2.45 GHz, 3.5 GHz, and 
5.6 GHz covering several present wireless 
communication systems, i. e. 1.75 GHz (1.71 GHz–1.88 
GHz) of Digital Communication System (DCS), 2.45 
GHz (2.4 GHz–2.484 GHz) and 5.2 GHz/5.8 GHz (5.185 
GHz–5.35 GHz/5.725 GHz–5.875 GHz) of wireless local 
area network (WLAN), and 3.55 GHz (3.3 GHz–3.7 GHz) 
of world interoperability for microwave access 
(WiMAX). Details of the antenna design are described, 
and results of some prototypes are presented and 
discussed. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
With the development of wireless communication systems, 
world interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) has 
more advantages on broadband speed. Based on the IEEE 
802.16 standard [1], we try to design a multiband antenna 
for WLAN and WiMAX applications with a meaningful 
shape patch. Planar antennas have advantages of small size, 
light weight, and low cost. To design a unique and 
meaningful shape of an antenna, we use the abbreviation of 
our university name, NCNU. In [2], the antenna was 
designed using the university logo, which was a slot cut on a 
patch. Nevertheless, in this study, several metal strips are 
used to form the NCNU shape and a 50 ohms microstrip is 
adopted to feed to antenna [3], [4]. Since radiating elements 
of the antenna consist of many strips, the different modes 
would be excited and the antenna could be applied for 
multiband purposes [5]. For the first time, the proposed 
antenna is designed step by step by trial-and-error approach 
to determine which radiating letter/strip contributes the 
corresponding resonant frequency. After that, we use 
particle swarm optimization (PSO) combined with the

method of moments (MoM) to design the antenna. Both 
approaches achieve the design goal. The first band of the 
proposed antenna with a bandwidth of 120 MHz (1700 
MHz–1820 MHz) is to be used for DCS. The second band 
of the proposed antenna with a bandwidth of 90 MHz (2400 
MHz–2490 MHz) is to be used for IEEE 802.11b/g. The 
third band with a bandwidth of 530 MHz (3290 MHz–3820 
MHz) is to be used for WiMAX applications, and the forth 
band with a bandwidth of 1460 MHz (4890 MHz–6350 
MHz) is to be used for IEEE 802.11a.. In the operating 
bands mentioned above, the proposed antenna has good 
gains and radiation patterns. 
II. ANTENNA DESIGN BY TRIAL-AND-ERROR APPROACH 
Fig. 1 shows the designed process of the NCNU letters 
into the proposed antenna structure. At first, we design two 
N-shape strips as shown in Fig. 1 (a). Second, we design the 
C-shape and U-shape strips and connect the lower N-shape

The simulated and measured return losses of the antenna 
are shown in Fig. 4, which shows that the antenna is suitable 
for WLAN and WiMAX applications. Another resonant 
frequency excited at 1.6 GHz although the antenna is not 
attempted on applications at the resonant frequency. 
However, the resonant frequency could be adjusted for 
further applications. Measured radiation patterns at 1.6 GHz, 
2.45 GHz, 3.5 GHz, and 5.6 GHz in the x-z plane and the y-
z plane are shown in Fig. 5. The omnidirectional patterns in 
the x-z plane cut are obtained at 1.6 GHz and 2.45 GHz. 
The simulated surface current distributions on the printed 
metal portions of the substrate at 1.6 GHz, 2.45 GHz, 3.5 
GHz, and 5.6 GHz are shown in Fig. 6. In Fig. 6, we could 
find that the lengths, which have strong currents flowing on 
the strips, are about half-wave guided length, λg, where

For example, in Fig 6 (b), the currents mainly flow on U-
shape and part of 50 Ω microstrip and lower N-shape where 
the lengths of both are about 37 mm, which is about λg/2 at 
the resonant frequency 2.45 GHz. Similarly situations can 
be found at other resonant frequencies. Therefore, the 
antenna is mainly excited at half-wave length modes. The 
resonant frequency at 3.5 GHz of the antenna mainly 
depends on the strip connecting between the N-shape and U-
shape as shown in Fig. 6 (c). The ground plane (Z = 0 mm) 
of the proposed antenna is also a part of the radiation 
elements since some currents flow on the plane. We may 
adjust the dimension of the ground plane to get a better 
impedance matching. The simulated maximum gain of 1.6 
GHz, 2.45 GHz, 3.5 GHz, and 5.6 GHz is 0.55 dBi, 1.84 dBi, 
0.97 dBi, and 3.94 dBi, respectively. The gap location, W3, 
on the lower N-shape and the width of the gap, G, affects 
the higher frequencies (5 GHz - 6 GHz) as shown in Fig. 7.

IV. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, a NCNU-shape antenna for multiband 
applications has been presented. For the first time, the 
antenna is designed by trial-and-error approach. After that, 
we use particle swarm optimization in conjunction with 
method of moments to design the same antenna. Numerical 
simulations and experimental measurements show that the 
proposed antenna has good performance. By current 
distributions excited at resonant frequencies, the proposed 
antenna is excited at half-wave guided length modes. The 
resonant frequencies operating at desired bands are 
successfully obtained by both design approaches. Using the 
optimization approach, the antenna design process is 
automatically and better results are obtained efficiently. 
With advantages of the antenna size and shape, the proposed 
antenna may be suitable for other applications such as 
wearable antennas or logo-type antennas in the future 
applications.

gap, W7, affect the higher frequencies (5 GHz-6 GHz) as 
shown in Fig. 8. This result also can be confirmed by the

Introduction
Recently, a novel global optimization technique, Taguchi's method [1] was introduced to
electromagnetic (EM) community [2] and successfully has applied to optimize some EM
applications such as linear array synthesis [3], ultra-wideband (UWB) antenna [4], planar
filter designs [5], which demonstrated its great potential on optimization and its
advantages of solving complex problem ability, good convergence, and easy coding. In
this study, a two-element series aperiodic coplanar waveguide (CPW) slot antenna array
[6] is optimized by Taguchi's method and PSO method [7], where a full wave simulator,
IE3D, based on method of moments, is used to analyze the antenna and integrated with
the two optimization approaches. The design objectives are that the optimized two-
element antenna has a dual-resonant frequency feature at 5 GHz and 6 GHz. Moreover,
by optimizing the antenna under the same optimization conditions, the optimization
performance of the two optimization approaches can be compared with each other.
Optimization results show that the desired frequency responses of the antenna are
successfully obtained by the two approaches; the superior optimization performance of
Taguchi's method makes it a viable alternative optimization scheme for EM applications.
Optimization Approaches, Taguchi's method and PSO
(A) Taguchi's Method
Taguchi's method was developed based on the concept of orthogonal array (OA), which
can effectively reduce the number of tests required in a design process [2]. The notation
OA(N, k, s, t) is used to represent an N rows by k columns (for k parameters) OA with s
levels and t strengths. The procedure of iterative Taguchi's method starts with the
problem initialization including definitions of solution space, fitness function, and
selecting a proper OA. After determining the corresponding values for the s levels of
each input parameter, N experiments are conducted and their fitness values are calculated
as well. The corresponding signal-to-noise (SIN) ratio (1] ) of each fitness value can be
obtained by the following equation [1]
17=-20Iog(Fitness) (dB). (1)
Therefore, a smaller fitness value results in a larger 17. The entries of the response table
can be determined by the following equation [2]
f/(m,n) =; L TJ;, (2)
i,OA(i,n)=m
where m is the mth level and n is the nth parameter. Hence, fj(m, n) is an average of 1] of
nth parameter for allievel-m. The optimal level values of each parameter can be identified

(8)
impedance matching at the resonant frequencies. To save the number of unknowns in an
IE3D simulation, the antenna is simulated using the magnetic current modeling method.
The fitness function is defined as
Fitness = r(f = 5.0 GHz)+ r(f = 6.0 GHz) (6)
The reflection coefficient r at each desired resonant frequency has equal priority in the
fitness function, which can be seen as a dual-objective fitness function. The design goal is
taken as
ISlll < -35 dB at 5.0GHz and 6.0GHz. (7)
Since there are 9 parameters to be optimized, an OA(27, 9, 3, 2) [11] is adopted in
Taguchi's optimization. In PSO, 27 particles (rows) are also used for fair comparison.
Under the same optimization conditions, the performance of the two optimization
approaches can be compared with each other by comparing the number of iterations
required. The solution space (unit: mm) of each parameter is defined as
Ln e (6.07, 12.07), In e (2.35, 4.35), Gn e (0.3, 0.6), dn e (--4.0, 4.0)
and De (8.22, 18.22) .
Optimized Results
Compared with the fitness curves shown in Fig. 2, only 29 iterations are required to meet
the design goal shown in (7) using Taguchi's method. However, 124 iterations are
required using PSO to meet the same design goal. The return losses of the optimized
antenna by Taguchi's method and PSO are shown in Fig. 3. Both return losses show the
good impedance matching at 5 GHz and 6 GHz. The frequency response of the prototype
antenna is also shown in Fig. 3 for comparison. Note that the initial frequency response
of the prototype antenna is quite poor before optimization. The number of iteration
reduction for optimizing the antenna by Taguchi's method and PSO is around 76 %,
which shows that Taguchi's method is quicker than PSO to achieve the same
optimization goal in this case.
Conclusion
Taguchi's method was used, in conjunction with a full wave electromagnetic solver, to
design a two-element series aperiodic slot antenna array. Taguchi's method was
compared with PSO and was found to be more efficient in the slot antenna example.
