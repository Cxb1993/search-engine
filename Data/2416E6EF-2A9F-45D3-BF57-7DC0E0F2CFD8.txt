A dark field image using (11 1)L10 reflection,
corresponding to Fig. 1(a), is shown in Fig. 1(c). Figure
1(d) is a bright field (BF) image. The (0 22)L1m
adaptive L1m monoclinic phase (gray contrast) shuffling
the ordered L10 martensitic (11 1)L10 crystal plane
(bright contrast) can be seen in the BF image.
Figures 2(a)-(d) are a series of TEM micrographs
taken from the alloys after S. T., then thermally aging at
550 C for 110 h. Figure 2(a) is a typical SADP zone
axis [112]L10//[11 1]L1m (hkl denotes the ordered
L10 phase; hkl denotes the monoclinic L1m structure).
Careful analysis of the SADP zone axis, reveals it as
(11 1)L10//(101)L1m, in which the result is coincident
with the X-ray diffraction pattern as shown in Figs.
4(b)-(c). Note that in the SADP around the (022)L1m,
(121)L1m reflection, very small extra diffraction spots
can be seen in the micrograph, indicating that the L1m
→ L10 phase transition is accompanied by a modulation
due to the composition fluctuations with shuffling of
crystal planes [1-2,4-6]. Also, the intensity of the extra
diffraction spot seems to gradually decrease compared
to that of the specimen aged at 450 C for 100 h (Fig.
1(a)). Figure 2(b) is a DF image formed using (101)L1m
reflection that corresponds to Fig. 2(a). From the DF
image of Fig. 2(b) analysis, we can see the tiny APBs
morphology as well as tweed structures. Figure 2(c) is a

DF image form using (110)L10 reflection corresponding
to Fig. 2 (a) that the bright particles are the ordered L10
martensitic structures, in which we can also see the tiny
APBs. These APBs are the primary obstacles to the
domain wall motion. The observed APBs microstructure
in the L1m with L10 structures strong illustration the
mechanism of coercivity in the Fe-Pd-Rh alloys is
pinning controlled [3-6]. Figure 2(d) is a BF image. The
tweed microstructures as well as the planar defect
appear very sharply in the BF image. For further
confirmation of the APBs and microtwins existing in the
aged Fe-Pd-Rh alloys, a high magnification TEM
micrograph including APBs and microtwins, indicated
by arrow, is shown in Fig. 3(b). The APBs and
microtwins pinning the magnetic domain are further
demonstrated as a possible source of magnetic
hardening of the alloys after S. T. and thermally aged
treatment.

and discussion in the above-Sections 3.1.-3.2. The
characteristic magnetic property of the magnetic test
exactly coincides with the microstructure analysis.
The magnetization behavior of the hysteresis loop
of the alloys aged at 450C for 100 h has been shown in
Fig. 5(b), in which some of the intrinsic magnetic
properties and domain parameters of the aged Fe-Pd-Rh
alloys are obtained from the experimental results and
the equation data [3,13-14] as shown in the following:
(1) anisotropy constant K1 = Ms×Ha/2 = 1.45×10
7
ergs/cm3, (2) Ms (saturation magnetization) at R. T. =
970 emu/cc, (3) Ha (anisotropy field) = 30 kOe, (4) Tc
(Curie temperature) = 485 C (758 K), (5) B (domain
wall thickness) =(A1/K1)1/2 = 82 Å, (A1 = 106 ergs/cm,
A1: exchange parameter), (6) (domain wall energy) =
4(A1K1)
1/2 = 15 ergs/cm2, (7) energy product (B×H)max
theor = (4Ms/2)2 = 37 MGOe.

M-H curves measured at temperatures 50, 200, and 350
K of the Fe-30Pd-4Rh alloys: (a) solution-treated (S. T.)
at 950 C for 1.5 h and water quenched; (b) S. T. then
thermally aged at 450C for 100 h.
4. Conclusions
1. On S. T. and quenched the alloys in water, the γfcc
phase separates into γfcc+L1m+L10 structures, then
by thermally aging the alloys, the γfcc+L1m+L10
phases decompose into bct+L1m+L10 structures, as
verified by both the TEM and the X-ray diffraction
pattern.
2. TEM and X-ray diffraction study confirms that an
intermediate martensitic structure exists between the
fcc → L10 martensitic transformation in the aged
Fe-Pd-Rh alloys. The intermediate phase (L1m) has a
monoclinic structure with the lattice parameters of a
= 3.193 Å, b = 3.684 Å, c = 3.141 Å, and β = 
92.042°. The observed intermediate L1m monoclinic
phase suggests to be the adaptive martensitic
structure.
3. TEM selected area diffraction pattern (SADP)
reveals that the orientation relationships between the
L10; L1m can be demonstrated as [101]L10//[100]L1m
and [112]L10//[11 1]L1m, respectively.
4. The observed APBs and microtwins in the TEM
image suggest that the primary mechanism of
coercivity in the aged Fe-Pd-Rh alloy system is
pinning controlled and the planar defects such as
APBs and microtwins are the primary obstacles to
domain wall motion.
5. The hysteresis loops of the aged alloys exhibit an
abrupt drop at the saturation remanence (Mr)
indicating two phases with a different saturation
remanence existing in the aged alloys. The two
phases, i.e., the adaptive L1m monoclinic phase and
the ordered L10 martensitic structure are
demonstrated by TEM and X-ray diffraction study.
