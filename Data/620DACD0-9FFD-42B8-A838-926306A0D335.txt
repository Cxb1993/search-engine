ABSTRACT 
A growing number of epidemiologists are now working to refine computer simulation methods for 
diseases as a strategy for helping public policy decision-makers assess the potential efficacies of 
tactics in response to newly emerging epidemics. These efforts spiked after the SARS outbreak of 
2002—2003. Here we describe our attempt to help novice researchers understand epidemic 
dynamics with the help of Huang et al.’s (2004) Cellular Automata with Social Mirror Identity 
Model (CASMIM), a small-world epidemiological simulation system. Using the SARS scenario as a 
teaching example, we designed three sets of instructional experiments to test our assumptions 
regarding a) simulating epidemic transmission dynamics and associated public health policies; b) 
assisting with understanding the properties and efficacies of various public health policies; c) 
constructing an effective, low-cost (in social and financial terms) and executable suite of epidemic 
prevention strategies; and d) reducing the difficulties and costs associated with learning 
epidemiological concepts. With the aid of the proposed simulation tool, novice researchers can 
create various scenarios for discovering epidemic dynamics and for exploring applicable 
combinations of prevention or suppression strategies. Results from an evaluative test indicate 
significant improvement in the ability of a group of college students with little experience in 
epidemiology to understand epidemiological concepts. 
KEYWORDS 
Learning through simulation, epidemiological model, public health policy, small-world network. 
researchers are repeatedly challenged by the task of simulating individual movement within a society—an 
issue referred to in the literature as the “mobile individual problem” [17-20]. After the SARS outbreak of 
2003, Huang et al. [21-22] proposed a small-world epidemiological model for simulating epidemic 
transmission dynamics and public health policies and named it the Cellular Automata with Social Mirror 
Identity Model, or CASMIM (Fig. 1). They established the social mirror identity for integrating long-distance 
movement and geographic mobility into their model, simulating the transmission dynamics of contagious 
diseases, and investigating the effectiveness of various combinations of public health policies and epidemic 
prevention strategies [21-23]. 
Results from experimental simulations indicate that CASMIM is a robust and extensible epidemiological 
simulation system suitable for multiple applications, including classroom demonstrations of many types of 
epidemics and detailed numerical experiments involving specific epidemic diseases and public health policy 
suites. It can therefore serve as a good starting point for teaching and training novice researchers and 
epidemiology students. In addition, it should be noted that CASMIM’s value is not just for demonstrations, 
but also for performing interactive simulations. Novice researchers can use CASMIM to simulate and 
confront real-world problems. Through comparisons and discussions of simulation results with peers [24], 
individual understanding of epidemic dynamics can be enriched and different hypotheses may be evaluated in 
terms of their rationalities. 
---Figure 1 about here--- 
In this paper we will describe three sets of instructional experiments for teaching social science 
researchers and inexperienced epidemiologists how to use the CASMIM system to simulate epidemic 
dynamics and create strategies to address real-world issues. Our primary teaching goals are a) simulating 
epidemic transmission dynamics and public health policies associated with epidemics; b) understanding the 
properties and effectiveness of various public health policies, alone and in combination; c) constructing 
effective, inexpensive (in terms of financial and social costs), and executable suites of epidemic prevention 
strategies; and d) reducing costs associated with learning epidemiological principles. 
2. RELATED THEORIES AND SYSTEMS 
2.1. Teaching and Learning through Simulation: High-Level Intellectual Effort 
Instruction-based education is often criticized for only providing information without teaching practical 
skills that learners can use to solve real-world problems [25]. Until very recently, science education has 
emphasized hastily taught concepts while neglecting the importance of exploring problems from a learner’s 
own experiences. Consequently, learners tend to become obsessed with complex procedures described in 
textbooks. Computer simulations are now employed to support learning or training based on constructivist 
learning principles [26-27]. In a report on educational technology prepared for the U.S. President’s Office, a 
committee of science advisors presented a list of the most promising constructivist applications of technology; 
simulations were at the top of that list [28]. 
Infectious, meaning that an individual can infect others; and Removed, meaning that an individual has either 
recovered, died, or otherwise ceased to pose any further threat. During epidemic outbreaks, new infections 
occur because infected and susceptible individuals come into direct contact with each other. Susceptible 
individuals consequently become infected according to probabilities associated with a combination of 
personal and disease characteristics. 
The spreading of a contagious disease reflects a close relationship between social networks and 
individuals who come into contact with each other. The initial version of the SIR model assumed that 
interactions among S, I and R individuals occur according to a “well-mixed hypothesis” [35-36] in which 
they interact without concern for population structure. Though improbable, this hypothesis simplifies contact 
factors that must be considered when formulating an epidemiological model. A random interaction hypothesis 
also makes it easier for epidemiologists and public health specialists to construct SIR models that represent 
ranges of possible transmission dynamics for epidemic outbreaks, infectious origins, and disease parameters 
based on data collected during previous outbreaks of contagious diseases. 
Results from statistical analyses and computer simulations show that the global topological 
characteristics of social networks exert considerable influence on the behavior of easily spread diseases [15, 
21, 35]. These characteristics allow for the detailed study of more subtle aspects of contagious disease 
transmission that cannot be performed using non-network models such as the original SIR. Furthermore, the 
need to identify targeted and more efficient intervention strategies requires accurate model representations of 
public health policies with geographical properties (e.g., home quarantines and hospital visitation bans). An 
important disadvantage of the SIR model and its derivatives is that aggregate variables and differential 
equations can increase very quickly as the number of populations under consideration grows—for instance, 
healthcare workers, hospital patients, or the family members of individuals under home quarantine [35-36]. 
3. SIMULATION SYSTEM FOR STUDYING EPIDEMICS AND PUBLIC-HEALTH 
POLICIES 
Huang et al.’s [21-22] CASMIM is a small-world computation simulation model. CASMIM 
conceptualizes individuals as elements and their most frequently visited places as logically abstracted mirror 
identities—for example, homes, train stations, workplaces, and restaurants. The mirror identity concept 
utilizes simple social networks to a) preserve the properties of elements that interact with their neighbors 
within two-dimensional lattices, and b) reflect such activities as long-distance movement and daily visits to 
fixed locations. For this reason, the mirror identity concept in CASMIM is suitable for describing epidemics 
in modern societies. The model has clustering and small-world properties that allow it to simulate epidemic 
transmission dynamics. By manipulating disease parameters and public health policies, CASMIM can be used 
to simulate the transmission dynamics of influenza, tuberculosis, and other contagious diseases. 
3.1. Cellular Automata with Social Mirror Identity Model (CASMIM) 
3.2. Parameters 
In CASMIM, users can manipulate several kinds of parameter sets. For example, parameters H and W in 
Table 3 control the height and width of two-dimensional cellular automata. A combination of P and M can be 
used to set up a specific agent population and its mirror identities for a simulation. Detailed examples of 
simulation parameters are shown in Tables 3-5. Details for environmental and population parameters and their 
default values are shown in Table 3. The default values allow first-time users to quickly execute simple and 
understandable demonstrations. 
---Table 3 about here--- 
The second set contains three types of epidemic parameters; the first type includes PeriodIncubation, 
PeriodInfectious, PeriodRecovered, and PeriodImmune (Table 4). These have strong associations with specified 
epidemic characteristics and epidemic progress (e.g., SIR or SEIR—Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and 
Recovered). The second type consists of individual statuses such as the percentage of super-spreading events 
and age distribution (e.g., youth, adult, and elderly). The final type consists of RateForeverImmunity, RateInfection, 
RateDeath, and FrequencyContact. These are used to determine epidemic transmission mechanisms among 
individuals. 
---Table 4 about here--- 
The final CASMIM parameter set addresses the efficacy and efficiency of various public health policies 
(Table 5). Participation rates indicate the percentage of individuals who follow the suggested or required 
public health policy. Examples of public health policies that affect epidemic prevention rates include wearing 
masks by the general public or hospital workers, body temperature measurement, and home quarantine for 
various time periods. Different types of masks—general, activated carbon, disposable surgical, N95—are 
rated as having the respective efficacies of preventing the transfer of viruses of 25, 50, 75, and 95 percent. A 
second example is home quarantine period. During the SARS outbreaks in 2002-2003, the World Health 
Organization (WHO) suggested that the minimum length of home quarantine should be the twice the viral 
incubation period. Altering the length of the quarantine period allows students to determine the best 
combination of length and social costs. 
---Table 5 about here--- 
Most data required for establishing epidemic parameters are available from national health authorities or 
WHO. This includes data for R0, PeriodIncubation, PeriodInfectious, PeriodRecovered, and PeriodImmune. Values for 
RateForeverImmunity, RateDeath, and average number of mirror identities require input from disease experts and 
epidemiologists, while novice simulation tool users are capable of manipulating the public health policy 
parameters listed in Table 5. Some environmental parameters (e.g., RateInfection, FrequencyContact) can be 
derived from R0 using the following equation: [22]  
0 (avg. of social mirror identity no. of neighbors )Contact Contact Infection InfectiousR R T R P= × × × × ×  
transmission dynamics in different areas and compare the effectiveness of various public health policies and 
disease prevention strategies. For example, knowing that SARS originated in China’s Guangdong province 
allows users to view SARS cases in all other countries as imported and to use the number of cases announced 
by local health authorities to determine transmission source information (e.g., number of infectious 
individuals entering a country, time steps during which they entered, and whether they entered as incubated or 
infected individuals). In three sets of instructional experiments we simulated public health policies at certain 
time steps according to actual announcements made by local health authorities, adjusting our environmental, 
epidemic, and public health policy parameters according to data reported by WHO [37] and Sebastian and 
Hoffman [38]. 
4.1. Experiment Set 1: Comparing Simulation and Actual Case Results 
Experiment Set 1 helps students learn how to simulate the 2002-2003 SARS outbreaks in Singapore, 
Taiwan, and Toronto. Novices are instructed to follow the command sets shown in Tables 8, 9, and 10 for 
running simulations. Learning objectives include: understanding the complexity of epidemic characteristics, 
learning the advantages of a computer simulation model, and predicting outcomes. A teaching plan based on a 
constructive approach (e.g., object, goal, problems, methods, activities, and discussions) is presented in Table 
7. Before running the simulation, students need to construct a knowledge base of epidemic characteristics and 
the instructor needs to demonstrate how to re-organize the collected data to form CASMIM-compatible 
parameter sets. The next step is for learners to input the parameters and perform the instructional commands 
according to the input and simulation flowchart discussed in Sec. 3.3. Students also need instruction in 
reading simulation results, including statistical reports and charts. 
---Table 7 about here--- 
4.1.1. Scenario 1: Singapore SARS Outbreak 
A comparison of actual and simulated SARS cases in Singapore indicate agreement in terms of two peak 
outbreaks that occurred between February 25 and May 5, 2003 (Fig. 7). Emergency public health policies 
were not activated following the first outbreak, which was attributed to imported cases. The second outbreak 
was attributed to the compound effects of secondary infections. Several emergency policies were put into 
effect on March 24, including a ban on visits to patients in hospitals or under home quarantine. The number of 
new cases dropped dramatically at the beginning of June; soon afterwards, WHO announced that the disease 
was under control. 
---Table 8 about here--- 
---Figure 7 about here--- 
4.1.2. Scenario 2: Taipei SARS Outbreak 
Our Taipei simulation included several public health policies enforced by that city’s government, 
including multiple grades of home quarantine and a mask-wearing requirement for all public bus and train 
passengers (Table 9). As shown in Figure 8, the simulated results had a close fit with the probable case curve 
general, carbon-activated, medical, and N95 masks, respectively. Students should also be given statistical 
charts for comparing the results of the various public health policies. The special statistical chart for 
nosocomial transmission can be used to analyze the efficacy of banning hospital visits. 
---Table 11 about here--- 
4.2.1. Taking Body Temperature 
The Singaporean and Taiwanese governments implemented temperature measurement policies during the 
SARS epidemic, going so far as to launch national campaigns that included installing temperature-monitoring 
equipment and setting up manual temperature measurement stations at various government buildings, clinics, 
and public transportation facilities. According to our simulation results, when such policies were both 
comprehensive and compulsory, they reduced the number of feverish individuals entering public places. 
However, in the real world this policy is difficult to set up and enforce, since implementation methods tend to 
vary, oversights are common, and an unknown number of individuals manage to avoid having their 
temperatures taken. Our results suggest that a participation rate of between 80 and 90 percent is required for 
this public health policy to have a positive effect on controlling a SARS-like epidemic (Fig. 10); it has little 
effect at a rate of 65 percent or lower. The policy also incurs significant social costs that include distributing 
thermometers, setting up temperature screening stations, and employing workers to take manual temperature 
measurements at various public facilities and medical clinics. 
---Figure 10 about here--- 
4.2.2. Wearing Masks with Different Protection Levels—General Public vs. Healthcare Workers 
The efforts of the governments of Taiwan and Hong Kong to promote general mask-wearing policies led 
to hoarding and panic buying. Masks are categorized according to grade—ordinary, surgical, etc. In Taiwan, a 
serious shortage of professional masks for medical staff occurred following a rush by the general population 
to purchase masks regardless of grade; this triggered a debate over the necessity of wearing N95 respirator 
masks outside of hospitals and clinics. According to the results of a simulation that we ran to analyze this 
policy, ordinary and surgical masks succeeded in controlling the epidemic outbreak as long as they were worn 
consistently throughout the desired time period (Fig. 11). At a prevention efficiency of 65 percent or more 
(meaning that the mask covered at least the mouth and nose), the epidemic could be controlled but not 
eliminated. When wearing ordinary masks, medical staff members still had relatively high infection rates 
(Figs. 11-12). These personnel clearly benefited from wearing N95 and other high-resistance masks in 
hospitals and clinics. According to these simulation results, we suggest that the general public should not be 
required to wear higher-grade masks, which instead should be reserved for medical staff and healthcare 
workers. 
---Figure 11 about here--- 
---Figure 12 about here--- 
Students should study the characteristics and properties of individual public health policies before 
running simulations to ensure reasonable estimates of efficacy and participation rates and proper 
Allocating limited resources should be a central learning objective for students of large-scale epidemic 
simulations. 
5. EVALUATION 
5.1. Participants 
Participants were 34 college students recruited from a private university in north Taiwan. They were 
assigned to working pairs for collaboration and for discussing simulation results. 
5.2. Procedure 
The 17 participant pairs were given three instructional assignments. For each one, students were given a 
pre-test to examine their understanding of epidemic dynamics, verbal and written information on simulation 
goals, tools for using simulation results to answer core questions, and a post-test in Appendix A to determine 
the effects of the CASMIM simulation tool on learning. 
5.3. Results 
Pre-test/post-test scores were measured on a scale of 0 to 50; scores for individual topics ranged from 0 
to 10. Results from a paired-sample t test indicate statistically significant improvement in overall 
understanding of epidemic concepts (pre-test: M = 31.71, SD = 3.11; post-test: M = 35.15, SD = 2.77; t = 
-5.36, p < 0.001). Specifically, the results show a significant difference in experiment sets 1 (comparing 
simulation and actual case results between outbreaks in Singapore and Taiwan) (pre-test: M = 6.12, SD = 1.01; 
post-test: M = 6.91, SD = 1.44; t = -2.17, p < 0.05) and 3-1 (assessing the efficacies of different combinations 
of public health policies) (pre-test: M = 6.59, SD = 1.37; post-test: M = 8.41, SD = 0.71; t = -5.12, p < 0.001). 
No significant differences were noted for experiment sets 2-1 (analyzing the effects of the wearing of 
protective masks by the general public) (pre-test: M = 6.24, SD = 1.15; post-test: M = 6.53, SD = 1.23; t = 
-1.32, ns), 2-2 (analyzing the effects of the wearing of masks by healthcare workers) (pre-test: M = 6.76, SD = 
1.09; post-test: M = 7.06, SD = 0.66; t = -1.32, ns), or 3-2 (estimating the social costs of different 
combinations of public health policies) (pre-test: M = 6.00, SD = 1.37; post-test: M = 6.24, SD = 1.15; t = 
-1.00, ns). 
5.4. Discussion 
As predicted, participants with prior epidemic simulation experience performed better on post-test items 
addressing epidemic-related concepts. However, detailed analyses of responses for each experiment set 
indicate insufficient understanding of epidemic transmission dynamics on the part of participants. Possible 
explanations include a) fear or misunderstanding of SARS, which may have interfered with the participants’ 
decisions concerning protective equipment; b) insufficient time for novices to become familiar with epidemic 
jargon; or c) lack of experience with budgeting social costs. We therefore investigated the results on 
when they learned that such masks could not only control but perhaps eradicate the SARS virus, perhaps due 
to their personal fears; another 11.8% said they were willing to buy the more costly professional masks to 
protect themselves. The results for set 2-2 indicate a very small difference between pre- and post-test 
preferences (100 and 80~90% protection levels). They also indicate that the participants believed that health 
workers deserved better protection as long as professional masks were available, comfortable to wear while 
working, and inexpensive. 
5.4.3. Experiment Set 3: Assessing the efficacies and social costs of different public health policy suites. 
Participants simulated each public health policy to gather data on efficacy and efficiency. They were 
taught how to observe the results of activating or disabling individual policies and how to test various 
combinations. The purpose of this set was to have participants identify which combinations were capable of 
abating the SARS epidemic within reasonable budget constraints. The set 3-1 results indicate statistically 
significant improvement regarding participant decisions on the efficacy rates of four public health policy 
combinations—that is, participants successfully learned the target information as conveyed via the simulation. 
It appears that follow-up guidance and explanations of simulation results by an instructor are very important 
for enhancing learning in this area. Test responses show that the participants did not acknowledge the 
importance of daily human contact on outbreaks of short-distance contagious diseases such as SARS. Pre-test 
responses show that just under one-half of the students (47%) recognized the combination of “public 
mask-wearing and reduced public contact” as being the least effective among the four public health policy 
combinations. A possible explanation is that they were not aware of the dual effects of public 
mask-wearing—protecting oneself from infection and preventing infected individuals from spreading the 
disease. Other problems were noted for two policies: “A-class home quarantine for 10 days” and “wide-scale 
taking of body temperatures.” The efficacy of the first may be reduced by difficulties associated with 
quarantining members of an infected individual’s family prior to the individual’s infection being reported. The 
efficacy of the second may be reduced due to instrument inaccuracy, difficulties associated with identifying 
individuals who are in an incubation period, and problems putting the policy into effect.  
As for the absence of statistical significance for the set 3-2 results, we offer two possible explanations: 
the lack of familiarity with budgeting issues among the college student participants and/or the insufficient 
clarity of the simulation results on estimating the social costs. 
6. CONCLUSIONS 
The use of computer-based social simulations to explore social issues and disease epidemics has 
increased rapidly in the past two decades. They can also serve as powerful instructional tools for providing 
learners with rich and low-cost opportunities to construct comprehensive understandings of simulation 
problems. For this paper we designed three sets of experiments to evaluate the utility of CASMIM (a 
simulation system that meets the requirements of epidemiologists and public health specialists for analyzing 
potential epidemic prevention strategies) for training policy decision makers and novice epidemiologists. Our 
results suggest that CASMIM exerts a significant impact on learner understanding of epidemic concepts.

Subject Use CASMIM to simulate different combinations of public health policies in response to an outbreak of SARS. 
Goal Students test various combinations in order to identify the best for mitigating the epidemic at a reasonable level of social costs.  
Introduction 
When faced with a new disease outbreak, decision makers must consider various public 
health policies and decide when to activate them. The compound effects of different policy 
suites can differ a great deal according to each policy’s scale, efficacy, and targeted goal. 
Social costs must also be taken into consideration—for example, establishing cooperation 
between health authorities and enforcement agencies, the cost of a public relations campaign 
to encourage mask-wearing by the general public, etc.  
Practice Students will practice using a computer simulation model to assess the efficacies and social costs of various health policies.

1) Problem understanding.  
a. Summarizing characteristics and properties of each health policy from Experiment

Description 
CASMIM is a small-world computer simulation model that conceptualizes individual daily 
contact networks. It is suitable for simulating short-distance contagious epidemic enterovirus 
diseases such as SARS. The underlying network structure can be modified to simulate other 
kinds of diseases with different infection routes (e.g., air transmission or sexual contact).  
Discussion 
Topics 
1) Which policy combinations are most effective for abating the spread of SARS? Create a 
list in order of effectiveness. 
2) Which policy combinations have the lowest social costs? List in order. 
Based on the pre-established data for this lesson, the correct order for most-effective and 
lowest social costs should be:  
• A-class home quarantine for 10 days and reduced public contact. 
• Wide-scale taking of body temperatures and hospital visitation restrictions. 
• Wide-scale taking of body temperatures, hospital visitation restrictions, and 
mask-wearing by healthcare workers. 
• Public mask-wearing and reduced public contact.

APPENDIX A 
Scenario and Post-test 
EXPERIMENT 1 
Scenario 
In 2002-2003, imported SARS cases from foreign countries increased early transmission rates via daily 
social contact networks. The increasing number of cases gained the attention of government authorities, 
which established control/preventive strategies to abate the epidemic (e.g., taking body temperature in public 
areas, stopping hospital visits, asking the general public to wear masks and to reduce public contact). With the 
execution of response policies, most countries successfully stopped SARS transmission. This lesson is aimed 
at teaching novices how to study SARS outbreak factors and to understand the efficacy of various 
interventions. After running simulations of outbreaks in Singapore and Taiwan, students should understand 
common characteristics of epidemic outbreaks and learn to prepare essential datasets for creating epidemic 
simulations

Discussion 
1) What differences or common features did you observe for the outbreaks in Singapore and Taiwan? 
EXPERIMENT 2 
Scenario 
Efforts by the Taiwan and Hong Kong governments to promote general mask-wearing led to hoarding 
and panic buying. In Taiwan, this resulted in a serious shortage of professional-grade masks for medical staff 
and triggered a debate on the necessity of wearing N95 respirator masks outside of hospitals and clinics. 
Simulations of general public and healthcare mask-wearing policies at different protection levels are used to 
teach novices public health policy concepts.

Simulation Result Samples 
The following simulation results focused on the impact of mask-wearing by the general public and 
healthcare workers (Figs. A-3 and A-4). Each mask-wearing policy was simulated at five protection levels: 0, 
50, 70, 90, and 100%. 
Discussion 
1) Large numbers of citizens come into daily contact in public areas such as mass transportation system 
stations. In such environments, which mask protection level is sufficient to help the general public avoid 
infection? 
0% = no mask    50% = regular surgical mask 
70% = activated carbon mask 90% = N95 respiratory mask 
100% = perfect protection 
Your choice ________.
