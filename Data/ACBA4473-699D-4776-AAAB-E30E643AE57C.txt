Abstract 
The objective of this project is free flight in 
the sky via wireless control method. By utilizing 
the previous fabricating experience of MAV, we 
got a great progress in this two year. The first half 
part of the research work is that we fabricated a 
MAV by MEMS process, and this MAV had a 
successful free flight with a range of 10 meters. 
The aerodynamic forces were also obtained by a 
multi-dimensional load-cell in the facility of the 
wind tunnel. In order to get a good flight 
performance, we re-designed a smooth 
gear-transmission system, and kept on searching 
light weight materials for the components of the 
MAV. We integrated all the components including 
the receiver, actuator, and poly lithium battery into 
the MAV. In the flight testing with wireless 
attitude control, the MAV had a successful flight 
with a range of 40 meters and an endurance of 10 
seconds. The second year, we kept on improving 
transmission system, and reducing the total weight 
of the MAV as far as possible. Not including the 
elevator, the weight of the MAV was only 5.8 
grams, and its flight endurance was 32 seconds by 
wireless attitude control. With the rudder and 
elevator, the weight of the MAV was 7.1 grams, 
and the MAV had a best flight endurance of 11 
seconds. Herein we also created a simplified 
module of flight aerodynamic force. Besides, in 
order to get the real aerodynamic force and the 
position of the MAV, we also attempted to 
integrate the accelerometer and RF module into 
the MAV.

Although the previous interesting works [2–8] of MAVs man-
aged to fly via wireless remote control, none of the programs has
been able to achieve a long and sustainable flight. Moreover, the
detailed mechanism of the flapping flight is still under study and
the unsteady aerodynamic characteristics of the flapping MAVs
are unclear.
In order to gather more information during the flapping
maneuver, we measured the aerodynamic force of a Caltech-
like MAV by conventional load-cells in the wind-tunnel, and
also proposed the integration of PVDF piezoelectric foils to the
parylene flapping wings of the MAV to pick up the in situ lift
force. We used MEMS technology to fabricate a titanium-alloy
wing frame and a set of gear-reduction transmission compo-
nents, and deposited conformal parylene film on the wing frame
as the airfoil skin [3,4,14]. The actuation force or torque avail-
able for the flapping wings is drained from the gear-reduction
transmission set coupled to a high-speed dc motor powered by
commercial poly-lithium batteries. The parylene wing skin also
serves as an electrical isolation layer between the PVDF piezo-
electric sensing element and the titanium frame. The on-site lift
information acquired from a PVDF sensing skin was done by the
authors of this presented work [15]. In ref. [15], we employed
the four-linkage concept to design a transmission mechanism for
the MAV. Although the two wings of the MAV have the same
flapping angle, there exists unavoidably a mechanical phase lag
between them by virtue of the transmission’s mechanical prin-
ciple of operation. The result in this paper proposes a novel
approach of integrating a parylene–PVDF hybrid wing in an
in situ way to monitor the lift force of a flapping MAV in the
wind-tunnel test. We found a new design methodology to adjust
the aerodynamic performance of MAV by changing the phase
lag between the two flapping wings through fine tuning of the
mechanism linkages.
2. Design concept
The issue of reducing weights for an air vehicle, especially for
the one with flapping wings discussed in this paper, is a very crit-
ical problem. The current trend is to employ small, palm-sized
wing foils. However, lift and thrust forces produced by the move-
ment of wing flapping also decreased with size reducing of the
airfoil, and therefore the wing size should be sufficiently large.
For this reason, adopting the titanium-alloy of high strength-
to-mass ratio as the airframe material and parylene as the skin
material of flapping wing is an appropriate compromise. Note
that a light-weighted and high-power battery is also needed.
To obtain an accurate size of a titanium-alloy airframe with no
residual stress is not easy with the conventional machining meth-
ods. Interior residual stress could cause a warping deformation
in the structures of airframes, and easily distorts the geometry
of the airfoil. Therefore, instead of the regular machining tech-
niques, wet etching technique is employed to tailor the airframe
structures from a titanium-alloy plate and no apparent residual
stress is found. Parylene coating technique is applied to laying
the wing skin attached on the titanium frame. The followings
are the design details of the airframe and a gear transmission
system associated with the airframe.
2.1. Design of the titanium-alloy airframe
The flapping wing motion of a nature bird includes flap-
ping, twisting, folding and gliding. These functions correlate
to the high efficiency of flapping mechanism. In order to reach
very light weight, the MAV in this work has flapping movement
of only one degree-of-freedom on purpose. The flapping wing
must be able to sustain higher flapping frequency and provide
sufficient force for flight. Higher flapping frequency involves
concerns with the structural integrity. Designing the flapping
wings with high strength and low weight is a crucial issue.
We use existing MEMS technology for fabricating the wings
to ensure the accurate size control and smartness of the fly-
ing system. The material of the airframe is titanium-alloy (the
mechanical properties of titanium grade 4: density = 4.54 g/cm3;
Young’s modulus = 104 GPa; tensile strength = 552 MPa). The
detailed dimensions of two types of the flapping wings as well
as their wing frames are shown in Fig. 1.

be derived as:
ρz(x, y, z) = d31σx(x, y, z) + d32σy(x, y, z) (5)
Combining Eqs. (2)–(5), we get the total charge Q in terms
of the pressure difference p and the stiffness function k as
follows:
Q =
∫ ∫
S

S
p(x, y, z)

+ d32
ky(x, y, z)
]
dA (6)
Because the stiff function kx and ky are not uniform over the
wing skin area S, the lift force L in Eq. (1) cannot be directly sep-
arated from Eq. (6). We temporarily and equivalently replace the
bracket in Eq. (6) with d*, and obtain the following expression:
Q = d∗L (7)
In Eq. (7), the total charge Q can be also expressed by a
voltage V across the piezoelectric (PVDF) capacitor C by the
relationship
Q = CV (8)
Combining Eqs. (7) and (8), the lift force can be determined
linearly with the voltage V.
L = Q

The simplified model described by Eq. (9) gives us a guideline
in principle that the lift information can be obtained electrically
from the voltage given by the PVDF piezoelectric film in an
in situ way. In addition, such an output signal from the PVDF
film needs calibration or quantitative comparison with the load-
cell sensors installed in the wind-tunnel available for the test of
MAVs in this work.
3. Fabrication
The fabrication process of titanium-alloy MEMS wings with
PVDF sensing film is shown in Fig. 4 and described as below.
• Step (a): A titanium-alloy substrate is cleaned with acetone
and isopropyl alcohol (IPA). Then, it is flushed with de-
ionized water (DI water).
• Step (b): Both sides of the titanium-alloy substrate are coated
with photoresist (PR), AZ4620, by a spin coater. Exact con-
trol of the rotation speed is exercised to get 10m thick PR,
serving as a mask layer for subsequent operation.
• Step (c): The upside PR is patterned by an I-line UV contact
aligner. This step defines a pattern as an etching masking
for the titanium-alloy frames against chemical etchant. The
developer for the AZ4620 PR is AZ400K.
• Step (d): The titanium-alloy substrate is dipped in hydrofluo-
ric (HF) acid to etch uncovered titanium for 50 min. After the
etching process, the geometry of the wing frames appears.
• Step (e): The substrate then put in acetone to strip PR from
both sides of the titanium-alloy substrate. All the parts are
cleaned and flushed with DI water.
• Step (f): The first parylene layer is deposited on the titanium-
alloy in the SCS PDS-2010 parylene coater. For this step,
15 g of parylene dimmer yields an approximately 11.5m
thick film and this parylene film is used as an insulated layer.
• Step (g): A PVDF film of 25m thick is pasted on the frames.
• Step (h): The PVDF film and the wing frame are coated with
the second parylene layer.

of them have the right tendency that lift forces increase with the
square of wind speed.
The aerodynamic performance of the two wings during flap-
ping was also studied. In the flapping test, the flapping frequency
f is controlled by a dc motor and the voltage applied to the motor
was set from 3 to 7 V to get the flapping frequency ranging from
of 7 to 16 Hz. This dynamic experiment was conducted at the
wind speed U of 1–5 m/s. Fig. 9 shows the experimental results.
The lift and thrust coefficients can be expressed as follows:
CL = 2L
ρAU2
(10)
CT = 2T
ρAU2
(11)
where L, T, ρ, U, and A are lift, trust, air density, flight speed,
and wing area, respectively. The advance ratio J is defined as the

ratio of the flight speed to the speed of the wingtip:
J = U
2φfb
(12)
where φ, f and b are stroke angle, flapping frequency, and semi-
wing span, respectively. For the general case of unsteady state
flapping flight, the advance ratio J is less than 1. The advance
ratio J approaches to infinity for the case of a fixed wing (no
flapping). In this work, even with an angle of attack is set constant
(20◦), we can still adjust the flapping frequency and the wind
speed to get various values of J in the flapping (dynamic) test.
From the result illustrated in Fig. 9, CL increases rapidly as J
approaching to zero. With J increasing, CL approaches to the
static value of 0.13 (J > 4) which is almost equal to the value of
CL of no flapping mode in Fig. 8.
The result of Fig. 9 also shows that Wing A (Caltech-like
MAV) is superior to Wing B both in generating lifts and trusts
during the flapping flight. The data are rather scattering near
J = 1. The issue is due to the very long testing time (over 10 h for
extracting 25 data points of CL and CT) of our MAV in the wind-
tunnel. Consequently, the structure of our MAV encounters the
aging problem. For example, many mechanical components of
the MAV start to deviate from their original positions, and con-
sequently degrading their aerodynamic performance. Fig. 9 also
reveals that, as J is less than 1, Wing A (Caltech-like) generates
somewhat larger lift and thrust coefficients than Wing B in the
flapping mode of flight. It is for the excuse that Wing A has its
wing spar, wing chord and wing rib stronger than Wing B, and
such a high stiffness of flapping wing generates flight with high
speed and flapping frequency.
We also allowed the two types of flapping MAVs to perform
their free flights, i.e., let them sustain the flight by poly-lithium
batteries without remote flight control on the stability of the
MAV in real time. Even though Wing A has a superior aerody-
namic performance as mentioned above, it has no successful free
flight so far. The reason may be due to the difficulty in locating
and adjusting the gravitation center as well as the aerodynamic
center of this two-wing MAV that we cannot ensure the static
stability of Wing A (Caltech-like). On the contrary, Wing B has
a successful free flight with a flight range of more than 10 m.
The on-site lift output from PVDF sensing skin on the MAV
is no doubt the primary viewpoint and contribution of this work.
Wing A with PVDF–parylene composite skin is adopted for
this test. The aerodynamic signals are picked up successfully
by PVDF and load-cell simultaneously. While the link BC is
11 mm, the collected lift data are shown in Fig. 10. It appears
that there is a phase delay between the PVDF signal (Fig. 10(a))
and load-cell signal (Fig. 10(b)). However this is due to that the
left wing is composed of a PVDF sensing skin and the right wing
is pure parylene. The signal from the PVDF film denotes the lift
information of the left wing, which does not include the right
wing. Therefore, the signal from the load-cell, Fig. 10(b), can be
regarded as the summation of the PVDF signal and its analogous
one from the right wing with a proper phase lag (which is not
exactly the lag from the gear transmission system in Table 1, but
existing a certain relationship between the two lags).

5. Conclusion
This study presents a smart wing with PVDF–parylene
composite skin by MEMS process and a four-bar linkage trans-
mission system with variable phase lags of the flapping wings.
The signals from the PVDF film and the load-cell are acquired
simultaneously and the curves are quite similar. This result
demonstrates that the smart PVDF skin has the promising capa-
bility to monitor aerodynamic information of flapping in the
future. In the wind-tunnel tests, the collected data has a phase
lag between the PVDF and load-cell curves due to the design
of asymmetric flapping movement. By a superimposing method,
the “pseudo” PVDF curve has higher similarity to the lift signals.
The smart PVDF–parylene composite wing and the superim-
posing method can help to design a micro MAV with ideal
aerodynamic characteristic by changing the phase lag between
the two flapping wings through fine tuning of the mechanism
linkages.
The performances of flapping wings are also studied in this
paper. The lift force increases with the square of the wind speed
in the non-flapping mode. In the unsteady state or the flapping
mode of our MAVs, the two-wing configuration has greater supe-
riority in terms of aerodynamic performance than the single
wing configuration. It is apparent that stiffness of flapping wing
plays an important role in producing lift and trust forces. The
MAV which has wingspan of 28 cm, including one commercial
lithium battery herein has a total weight less than 11 g and it has
a successful flight of more than 40 m by wireless remote control.
