(二) 計畫英文摘要: 
    In the 1980s, Motorola, Inc. introduced its Six Sigma quality program to the world. 
Some quality practitioners questioned why the Six Sigma advocates claim it is necessary to 
add a 1.5σ  shift to the process mean when estimating process capability. Bothe (2002) 
provided a statistical reason for considering such a shift in the process mean for normal 
processes. In this paper, we consider gamma processes which cover a wide class of  
applications. For fixed sample size n, the detection power of  the control chart can be 
computed. For small process mean shifts, it is beyond the control chart detection power, 
which results in overestimating process capability. To resolve the problem, we first examine 
Bothe’s approach and find the detection power is less than 0.5 when data comes from 
gamma distribution, showing that Bothe’s adjustments are inadequate when we have gamma 
processes. We then calculate adjustments under various sample sizes n and gamma 
parameter N, with power fixed to 0.5. At the end, we adjust the formula of  process capability 
to accommodate those shifts which can not be detected. Consequently, our adjustments 
provide much more accurate capability calculation for gamma processes. For illustration 
purpose, an application example is presented.

2. Gamma Process 
All of  us know that the case of  non-normal processes occurs frequently in practice, for 
example, in the semiconductor industry. Pyzdek (1992) pointed out the skewed distributions 
that are bounded on one side occur frequently in industry and gave several examples, such as 
a shearing process and a chemical dip process. The abundance of  outputs from skewed 
distributions makes the normality assumption often unreasonable. A gamma distribution, 
with varied N  and θ  values, covers a wide class of  non-normal applications. Therefore, a 
gamma process for data analysis has been chosen for this study. The difference between 
normal and gamma distributions is compared in Section 2.1. And the statistical property of  
gamma distribution is discussed in Section 2.2. 
2.1. The Gamma Distribution  
In this section, we investigate the gamma distribution to study the effect on the detection 
power of  the control chart. Observations from the gamma distribution are non-negative. The 
gamma distribution can be denoted as Gamma θ( ,  )N  with the probability density function 
given by Ross (2005) to be as follows: 
{ }θ θθ
−= −Γ
11( ;  , ) exp /
( )
N
N
f x N x x
N
, > 0x , N >0, θ >0 
and the mean and variance are given, respectively, by  
μ θ= N  and σ θ=2 2N . 
Denote the family of  gamma distributions with mean Nθ  by Gamma θ( ,  )N . The 
gamma distributions are skewed. To see how this distribution are different from the standard 
normal distribution in terms of  skewness and kurtosis, Table 1 presents the values of  
skewness and kurtosis (which are defined as the third and fourth moments of  the 
standardized distribution, respectively) of  the gamma distributions under study. Note that the 
case = 1N  corresponds to the exponential distribution and the skewness and kurtosis of  
Gamma ( ,  1)N are 2/ N  and 6 3N +  respectively. We can find in Table 1 when the N  
decreases, the corresponding values of  skewness and kurtosis will become large and far away 
from the values of  the standard normal distribution. The result through these distributions, 
we can get some insights of  the effects of  non-normality in terms of  skewness and kurtosis.

Figure 1 presents several gamma distributions along with a normal distribution for the 
same mean and variance. In this study, we let =N  0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, while (without loss 
of  generality) fixing θ = 1. These values of  N and θ  correspond to the values used by 
Schilling and Nelson (1976). As can be seen from Figure 1(a)-(f), as N  increases, the 
gamma distribution appears more nearly normal distribution. In fact, we demonstrate this 
convergence property in Table 1, by calculating the skewness and kurtosis. It can be seen that 
as N  increases, the skewness and kurtosis of  gamma distribution are very close to those of  
normal distribution. Through these distributions, we wish to get some insights of  the effects

the probability density function of  the average nX  for subgroup size n=2(1)5 in Figures 
2(a)-2(d). We can found that the variance of  average nX  will get smaller as subgroup size n 
increases. This situation means that the distribution of  nX  is more centralized when n>1.  
3. The Detection Power of Gamma Process  
The major purpose of  individuals control chart is assisting on identifying shifts and 
drifts in processes and it’s easily to be implemented. But, some assumptions should be 
satisfied before control charts are used. The assumptions include that the process 
characteristics must follow normal distributions. Actually, non-normal processes occur 
frequently in practice. Due to above-mentioned statements, we replace the traditional, 3μ σ± , 
to be the upper or lower control limits by the quantile of  cumulative distribution function for 
different parameters of  Gamma ( ),  N θ  ( 0.00135F  and 0.99865F ) and detect the power of  
gamma process under Bothe’s capability adjustments. 
Let 1X , 2X ,….., nX  be a sequence observations of  independent and identically 
distributed in Gamma ( ),  θN . Using the reproductive property of  gamma distribution, the 
mean of  the observations is nX  ( 1 1
n
n i inX X== ∑ ) which is distributed in Gamma ( nN , / nθ ), 
then we can obtain that

Figure 3 presents the power curves, these lines on the graph depict the probabilities of  
detecting a shift in μ  for the commonly used subgroup size n=3,4,5 (expressed in σ  units 
on the horizontal axis) when N=3. All these lines are close to zero for small shifts in μ . It 
can be found that the power of  the chart with all three curves eventually leveling off  close to 
100% as the size of  the shifts in excess of  3.5σ . The dashed horizontal line drawn in Figure 
3 shows that there is a 50% probability of  missing a 1.69σ  shift in μ  when n is 5, whileμ  
must move by 2.313σ  to have this same probability when n is only 3. The shift sizes that 
have a 50% probability of  remaining undetected, called 50AS  values are listed in Table 3 for 
subgroup sizes n=2(1)30. Momentary movements in  μ  smaller than 50AS σ  are more 
than likely to be missed by a control chart. Therefore our adjustment 50AS  takes into 
account those shifts that are not detected by the control chart. 
 
Figure 3. Power curves for the commonly used subgroup sizes 3,4 and 5 when N =3. 
We can obtain more accurate measures of  these percentile points ( 0.00135F , 0.5F  and 
0.99865F ) under consideration in the non-normal case, if  we are able to find a better 
distributional form for the data, which provides a very satisfactory fit. This involves 
modeling the process data with alternative probability plot models, such as the Weibull or 
gamma ones (see e.g. Dudewicz and Mishra (1998), Kotz and Lovelace (1998)). Nevertheless, 
an obvious disadvantage of  probability plotting is that it is not a truly objective procedure. It 
is quite possible for two analysts to arrive at different conclusions using the same data. 
Accordingly, it is often desirable to supplement probability plots with goodness-of-fit tests, 
which possess more formal statistical foundations (see, e.g., Shapiro (1995)). Choosing 
proper distribution to fit the data is an important step in probability plotting. Sometimes one 
can use the available knowledge of  the physical phenomenon or the past experience to 
suggest a choice of  the distribution. 
Modifying the Assessment of  pkC   
Since a process will experience shifts in 0.5F  (= median) of  various magnitudes and not 
all of  these will be discovered, we must take them into account when estimating outgoing 
quality so customers are not disappointed. Whereas the shifts of  process mean ranging in 
size from 0 up to σ50AS  are the ones likely to remain undetected (larger shifts should be 
detected by the control chart), a cautious method is to assume that every missed shift is as 
large as σ50AS . 
Considering the undetected process mean shift as large as σ50AS , we use 0.5F  minus 
σ50AS  to evaluate how well the process output meets the LSL and 0.5F  plus σ50AS  for 
determining conformance to the USL when estimating the index pkC . Incorporating both of  
these adjustments into the pkC  formula (See Equation (1)) we obtained the “dynamic” pkC  
index by making the following modifications: 
{ }0.5 50 0.5 50
0.99865 0.5 0.5 0.00135

By considering an adjustment σ50AS in this assessment for undetected shifts in process 
median, the estimate of  dynamic index pkC  will decrease and the expected total number of  
nonconforming parts will increase. It must be noticed that this nonconforming level assumes 
that undetected shifts are happening almost constantly and that every one is equal to σ50AS . 
From Table 3, the practitioners can find the 50AS  to calculate the dynamic index pkC  
for determining whether their process meets the preset capability requirement, and make 
reliable decisions to the process.  
6. Application 
The manufacture of  integrated circuits (ICs) includes the front-end process of  wafer and 
the back-end process of  integrated circuit packaging. In an integrated circuit packaging 
factory, the manufacturing process generally contains the following main steps: die sawing, 
die mounting, wire bonding, molding, trimming and forming, marking, plating and testing 
(Figure 4). Wire bonding is the most common means of  providing an electrical connection 
from the IC device to the lead-frame and it uses ultra-thin gold or aluminum wire to form the 
electrical inter-connection between the chip and the package leads (Figure 5). High-speed
