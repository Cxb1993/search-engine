periodically collects the network configuration and 
bandwidth requirement of each SS and comes out a 
schedule aiming to avoid collision, reduce the 
transmission cycle and achieve the goal of maximizing 
network throughput. In the distributed scheduling, each SS 
determines its own transmission schedule according to 
local information including the bandwidth requirements 
and slot allocation within two-hop neighboring SSs. A 
contention-based algorithm is required to determine the 
slot allocation. Compared with the distributed scheduling, 
the centralized scheduling mechanism maintains the global 
information including the network topology and the 
bandwidth requirements from all SSs and is therefore 
easier to implement and more efficient.  
Generally speaking, path planning and scheduling are 
the key factors that determine the throughput of WMN. 
However, they are not detailed in IEEE 802.16 standards. 
In the first year, we proposes an optimal scheduling 
algorithm that allocates and schedules the available 
bandwidth for each SS in the mesh network for 
maximizing the network throughput and minimizing the 
time period required for all requests. Based on the existing 
mesh network topology, the proposed algorithm allocates 
each time slot to as many collision-free transmissions as 
possible for exploiting the opportunities of spatial reuse. 
In addition, since all SSs and MSs directly connect to 
some BS, a large number of BS should be deployed to fully 
cover all service regions. However, the deployment of BS 
is expensive and the requirement of full coverage raises 
considerable costs. To reduce the cost of deploying base 
stations, the relay station (RS) interconnected between the 
base station and mobile stations (or subscriber stations) for 
WMANs is proposed in the new version of IEEE 802.16j 
standard[2]. The capacity of the IEEE 802.16j network 
will be constrained by the distance between the deployed 
BS and RSs. How to deploy the relay stations is crucial for 
improving the transmission efficiency. 
 In the second year, we develop a relay placement 
scheme for determining the locations for relay deployment 
such that the network capacity of IEEE 802.16j can be 
maximized. The proposed scheme takes into account the 
IEEE 802.16j frame constraint and bandwidth requirement 
constraint and tries to maximize the network capacity. 
However, the proposed scheme cannot determine the 
minimal number of RSs while required transmission 
demands of all users are satisfied.  
In the last year, we propose an efficient relay 
placement mechanism which aims at minimizing the 
number of required relay stations while the bandwidth 
requirements can be satisfied. Compare with the existing 
deployment scheme, our proposed deployment mechanism 
can reduce the deployment cost by deploying fewer RSs at 
appreciate locations such that the contribution of each RS 
in rate enhancement can be maximized. 
3. Related work 
For the third subproject of a three-year integrated 
project, we develop an optimal scheduling algorithm and 
two relay deployment schemes. The following presents the 
related scheduling algorithms for WiMAX mesh networks 
and related Relay deployment algorithms. 
3.1 The related scheduling algorithms  
   This section reviews the related scheduling 
mechanisms proposed in [3-6] and uses an example shown 
in Fig. 1 for comparing them with our proposed strategy. 
To simply the problem and make easy to understand, we 
assume all links in the tree topology have the same 
transmission rate. A general scheduling algorithm that 
considers variant rates will be proposed in the next 
Section. As shown in Fig.1(b), the uplink bandwidth 
requirements requested from SS1,SS2 and SS5 are 8, 4 and 3 
time slots, respectively. These traffics will be routed along 
the paths defined in the given tree topology and finally 
arrive to BS.

Figure 2 depicts an optimal scheduling which considers 
both spatial reuse and collision free factories for the 
example given in Fig.1(a). Notation (SSi, SSj) indicates the 
link from SSi to SSj. First, the BS schedules a parallel 
transmission for SS2 and SS5 and assigns four and three 
transmission slots for them, respectively. Upon receiving 
data form SS5, the SS4 immediately forwards data to SS3. In 
the meantime, the BS receives data form SS2 and then 
switches to receive data from another neighbor SS1. 
During the time period of transmission from SS1 to BS, 
another transmission (SS3, SS2) is in progress in parallel for 
increasing the spatial reuse. Eventually, the transmission 
requirements for each SS will be satisfied within 15 time 
slots.

3.2 The related relay deployment algorithms  
Recently, a number of related works [8]-[13] 
proposed relay station placement schemes to cope with the 
RS deployment problems in a WiMAX network. Study [8] 
partitions the network area into a number of small regions 
and applies Bender’s decomposition to determine the 
placement location of RSs. The scheme calculates the 
minimal number of relay stations based on the total 
bandwidth required by MSs for each region, and hence 
minimize the number of relay stations required for 
constructing the WiMAX network. However, the frame 
constraint of the IEEE 802.16j draft and the bandwidth 
constraints between BS and RS and between RS and MS 
were not considered.  
To minimize the deployment cost, study [9] 
proposes another scheme which selects the candidate sites 
based on the integer programming technique. Then the 
proposed deployment scheme determines the feasible 
number of base stations and relay stations by considering 
the bandwidth requirements of mobile stations. However, 
the candidate sites are randomly determined. The network 
throughput will be degraded if the RSs are deployed at the 
improper sites. In addition, the frame structure of IEEE 
802.16 is not considered. 
Some other relay deployment mechanisms were 
proposed by considering the feasible locations where the 
transmission rates can be improved. Wang et al. [10] aims 
at maximizing the network capacity by considering 
transmission rate and signal strength. To improve the 
network throughput, each RS will be deployed at a feasible 
location where the transmission rates of link L(BS, RS) and 
link L(RS, MS) are higher than that of L(BS, MS). 
However, the assumption that all bandwidth requirements 
are identical, which is not practical in most real 
applications. In addition, the proposed algorithm does not 
consider that the available bandwidth of each RS will be 
decreased with the number of MSs connected to the same 
RS.  
In addition to the improvement of network 
throughput, Lu et al. [11]-[12] further considered the 
budget constraint and proposed a deployment strategy of 
BS and RS. This scheme assumes that the candidate BS and 
RS locations are known. It determines the best locations 
for BS and RS deployment while the hardware cost does 
not exceed the budget constraint. However, the 
pre-determined candidate locations may result in the 
degradation of network capacity.  
Similar to previous studies [11][12], Chang et al. 
[13] considered the budget constraint and proposed a relay 
deployment scheme aiming at maximizing the network 
throughput. Given k relays, the proposed deployment 
scheme partitions the network region into k subareas and 
then calculates the best location of RS in each subarea. 
This study takes into consideration frame structure of 
IEEE 802.16j and variable traffic demand required by each 
users. However, the proposed scheme cannot determine 
the minimal number of RSs while required transmission 
demands of all users are satisfied. 
4. Research method and achievement  
4.1 Research method and achievement in the first year 
A. Basic Concepts and Scheduling Rules 
This subsection presents basic concepts and a set of 
scheduling rules that will be applied in our proposed 
algorithm. In a mesh network, a data flow is defined as a 
routing path that from a source SS to the destination BS. 
The following introduces the depend, interfere, parallel 
relations between SSs.  
 Dependent: a node vi is said to be dependent on another 
node vj and is denoted by vi vj if they belong to same 
data flow and vj is closer to destination than vi. In 
another word, if vi vj then vj will help to forward the 
traffic from vi. The transmission time allocated to vj must 
be later than that allocated to vi to ensure the data of vi 
could be successfully transferred to the BS.  
 Interfered: a node vi is said to be interfered with vj and 
denoted by vi ~ vj if interference occurred at the receiver 
side of vi or vj while vi and vj transmit data at same time. 
Therefore, if vi interferes with vj, they cannot transmit 
data at same time slots.  
 Parallel: a node vi is said to be parallel with vj and 
denoted as vi // vj if they can transmit data at the same 
time slot without interference at their receiver sides.  
According to the dependent, interfered and parallel 
relations between SSs, the BS can arrange a valid order of 
SS for data transmission in the mesh network.  
The following extends the three relations between 
two nodes to the relations between two sets. 
Definition: Sequential Relation Sa Sb 
Two disjoint sets Sa and Sb have Sequential Relation 
and is denoted by Sa  Sb if they satisfy vi  vj for  viSa and  vjSb. 
If two disjoint sets Sa and Sb have sequential relation, 
the time slots assigned to viSa and vjSb cannot be 
overlapped. This is because that each vjSb need to wait 
for the data transmitted from each viSa, hence, the time 
slots assigned to vj should be later than the time slots 
assigned to each viSa. Figure 6 gives a scheduling which 
considers the flow from v5 to BS in Fig.1(a). In this 
example, both v4 and v3 are dependent on v2, because v2 is 
closer to BS than v4 and v3 in the flow. Therefore, the

of all the scheduled nodes. The elements in an SNG can be 
extended from single source node to multiple source 
nodes. Notation U(SNG) therefore denote the optimal 
schedule of all nodes in the SNG. When the number of 
elements in an SNG is more than one, nodes in SNG might 
have Interfered Relation or Parallel Relation. Herein, we 
first discuss the interfered relation. Consider to paths Pi0 
and Pj0. Let the xth node vxi0 on path Pi0 and the yth node 
vyj0 on path Pj0 have Interfered Relation and their required 
transmission times are tx and ty. The optimal schedule of 
these two nodes will be represented by U({vxi0, vyj0}) = 
{{vxi0}tx~{vy j0}ty}tk where the total required transmission 
time tk= tx+ ty. In case that vxi0 and vyj0 have Parallel 
Relation, the time slots allocated to vxi0 and vyj0 could be 
overlapped for tk slots where tk = min(tx, ty). Therefore, the 
optimal schedule can be represented by U(SNG) = {{vii0}tx 
// {vj j0}ty}tk  ~ {v}tk’}tk” where v is the node that required 
longer transmission time in the parallel relation and tk’ is 
extra required transmission time for v after the parallel 
transmission.  
Because the relations among the nodes in the SNG 
could be very complex, the following discusses the 
derivation of an optimal scheduling U(SNG) in a 
systematically way. In the first step, we discusses the 
sequential relation and classify all the nodes in the SNG 
into k sets S1, S2,..., Sk, where any two different sets in {S1, 
S2,..., Sk} satisfy the Sequential Relation. Based on the 
above k classified sets, the optimal schedule U(SNG) can 
be represented by the sequential transmission of the k sets 
as shown in Equation (2) where opt(Si) denotes the optimal 
transmission schedule of nodes in set Si.    121 )(...)()()( 21  kk ttktt SoptSoptSoptSNGU  (2

The next further discusses the interfered relation 
existed between nodes. In the optimal schedule of Si, the 
transmission schedules in Si can be further divided into l 
sets N1, N2,..., Nl, where any two different sets in { N1, N2,..., 
Nl } satisfy the Interfered Relation as shown in equation 
(3).

In the optimal transmission schedule of Nj, assume m 
nodes are allowed for transmitting data at same time. The 
optimal schedule for each Nj could be represented as 
shown in Equation (4) where tm+1 = min (t1 , t2 ,…,tm).  
  ljPPPN mm ttmttj   ,//...//// 121 21  (4) 
The following uses two recursive equations to 
implement the dynamic programming algorithm for 
calculating the optimal uplink schedule as shown in 
Equations (5) and (6).

The recursive equation (5) helps derive the optimal 
schedule of SNG from the solutions of two smaller sets 
SNG’ and SNG-SNG’. Consider again the example shown 
in Fig.9. Let SNG be {va, vb, vc}. The optimal  solution 
U(SNG) could be derived based on the following three 
schedules: U({va} ∪ {vb, vc}), U({vb} ∪ {va, vc}) and 
U({vc}∪{va, vb}). The recursive relation of (5) can be 
applied again and hence the optimal  solution of U({vb, 
vc}), U({va, vc}) and U({va, vb}) can be derived form the 
optimal solutions of U({va}), U({vb}) and U({vc}) which 
are optimal schedules for single node transmission. 
Equation (6) copes with the problem how two optimal 
schedules U(SNGi) and U(SNGj) can be used to derive an 
optimal schedule for node set SNGi∪SNGj.

Let notation ⊕ denote the basic operation required 
for putting together the optimal transmission schedules of 
two smaller node sets SNGi and SNGj into consideration 
and deriving the optimal schedule for a bigger set SNGi∪
SNGj. The following discusses the details of operation ⊕. 
Consider the following two optimal schedules.  )(...)()()( 21 imiii SoptSoptSoptSNGU   
 )(...)()()( 21 jnjjj SoptSoptSoptSNGU 
To construct the optimal solution of U(SNGi∪SNGj), 
the parallelization task and sequencing  task are required 
to be executed on sets SNGi and SNGj. The parallelization 
task aims to extremely exploit the parallel transmissions 
between sets SNGi and SNGj while the sequencing task 
aims to guarantee that the sequential relations originally 
existed in SNGi and SNGj are also valid in the optimal 
schedule of U(SNGi ∪ SNGj). In executing the 
parallelization task, transmission schedule Ni // Nj should 
be extremely exploited for any iN   ixS  and jN  
 jyS under the following criteria.  
CM( kP , kP  ) = 0,  kP  iN  and  kP   jN . 
An exploitation of parallel transmission Ni // Nj can 
reduce the total transmission time from Ni(t)+Nj(t) to 
min(Ni(t), Nj(t))-|Ni(t)-Nj(t)|.  
Aside from the parallelization task, the sequencing 
task is needed to be applied on sets SNGi and SNGj to 
guarantee that the optimal schedule U(SNGi∪SNGj) can 
maintain the sequential relations existed in SNGi and SNGj. 
Therefore, for any schedules NjSix and Nj’Six’, if  x < 
x’ , Nj and Nj’ have sequential relation and the slots 
allocated to Nj must before the slots allocated to Nj’ .  
Figure 10 gives the detail steps of the proposed 
optimal scheduling algorithm. In step (3), the optimal 
schedule for the data transmission from a single node vi to 
BS along the path embedded in  the scheduling tree is 
constructed and stored in the array D[1][{vi}]. Based on 
Equation (6) and the information stored in D[1][{vi}], the 
optimal transmission schedule of any two nodes vi and vj 
could be calculated and stored in  D[2][{vi , vj}]. The 
operation for constructing the optimal transmission

location will be selected from the grids for deploying the relay. 
B. The proposed RPM 
This subsection presents the details of four phases 
designed in the proposed RPM. 
a. Partitioning Phase 
This phase aims to partition the given region A into k 
subregions with equal traffic demands. Two steps will be 
executed in this phase. First, the region A is equally 
partitioned into k partitions P1, …, Pk. The location of BS 
will be treated as the central point of a circle. The circle 
with 360 degree will be partitioned into k partitions by k 
partitioning lines where two consecutive lines have 360/k 
degrees. The second step is to adjust the partitioning line 
so that all partitions have equal traffic demands. To 
achieve this, the total traffic demands u(Pi) in each 
partition Pi will be calculated by (7).

In this step, a sub-region Ai only can be included in a 
partition. In case that a sub-region Ai is divided into two 
partitions by a partitioning line, sub-region Ai belong to the 
partition which contains the CPi of Ai. As a result, all 
subregions can be partitioned into k partitions. 
The next step is to adjust the partitioned line such that 
the total traffic demands of all partitions are equal. Firstly, 
the average traffic demands will be calculated. The 
adjustment of partitioning line will be executed 
sequentially from P1 to Pk along a clockwise direction. In 
case that the total traffic demands exceeds the average 
traffic demand, it will release some sub-regions that are 
close to the partition Pi+1 so that its total traffic demand is 
approach to the average traffic demand..  
b. Bright-Region Identification Phase 
This phase aims to identify a so called bright-region 
which is a promising region for deploying relay. Herein, a 
location in region A is said to be bright point if a relay 
deployed at this location can improve both the 
transmission rate and transmission latency. Otherwise, the 
point is said to be shadow point. The bright and shadow 
regions are the collection of all bright and shadow points 
in region A, respectively. The following proposes two 
criteria, called rate and time criteria, which will be used to 
identify the bright and shadow regions. 
Rate criteria: A relay RSj deployed for serving sub-region 
Ai should satisfy the rate criteria j
i
RS
CPr >
BS
CPi
r . 
Latency criteria: A relay RSj deployed for serving 
subregion Ai should satisfy the time criteria 
BSRSCP ji
t  < BSCPit  . 
The rate criteria asks for improving the transmission 
rate between BS and Ai if a relay RSj is deployed for 
serving Ai. On the other hand, the latency criteria 
constrains that the data forwarded by a relay RSj requires 
smaller latency than that required for directly exchanging 
data between sub-region Ai and BS. With the deployment a 
relay RSj for serving sub-region Ai, the rates between Ai 
and RSj and between RSj and BS can be derived by 
expression (6). However, the evaluation of transmission 
latency is more complicated since the frame structure 
designed in IEEE 802.16j draft should be taken into 
consideration.  
The following discusses how to evaluate the 
transmission latencies of two cases, depending on whether 
or not the data is forwarded by the relay. Let the total data 
volume required to be transmitted from MSs in subregion 
Ai to BS be ui. First, we consider that the data is directly 
transmitted from MSs to BS. In case that the data can be 
completely transmitted within an IEEE 802.16j frame, the 
latency will be equal to the transmission time. Otherwise, 
the latency will be the transmission time of ui plus total 
waiting time which depends on the number of frames the 
data can be completely transmitted from MSs to BS. 
Expression (8) gives the transmission latency required for 
directly transmitting data volume of ui from MSs in Ai to 
BS.

Alternatively, if the data is forwarded firstly from 
MSs to RSj and then from RSj to BS, the latency will be 
discussed by four cases, depending on whether or not the 
data transmissions, from MSs to RSj and from RSj to BS, 
can be completed in a frame. First, if both data 
transmissions can be finished in single frame, the latency 
will be the summation of times required to transmit data 
from MSs to RSj and from RSj to BS. However, if the data 
transmission from MSs to RSj or from RSj to BS cannot be 
completed in single frame, the latency calculations are 
similar to Equation (8) and are depicted in (9).

4.3 Research method and achievement in the third 
year 
The main goal of this work is to develop a relay 
placement scheme for minimizing the number of required 
relay stations while the bandwidth requirements of vehicle 
can be satisfied.  This work considers a given WiMAX 
service area A where a single BS has been deployed at the 
center location of the area. The network area A has been 
partitioned into a set of subareas A={A1, A2, ..., An}. 
Assume that the traffic requirement of each subarea Ai in 
each frame is reqid  which can be estimated according to the 
history traffic of the internet usage. The set of bandwidth 
requests is denoted by D={ reqd1 , 
reqd2 , ..., 
req
nd }. Let the 
location of BS be BS(0, 0). Let CPi denote the central point 
of subarea Ai, and the location of CPi is Ai(xi, yi). Let 
C={CP1, CP2, ..., CPn}. The main purpose of this report is 
to determine minimal number of relays such that the 
available bandwidths of BS and RSs satisfy the bandwidth 
requirements of vehicles. 
This report proposes an efficient relay placement 
mechanism which aims at minimizing the number of 
required relay stations while the bandwidth requirements 
can be satisfied. Compare with the existing deployment 
scheme, our proposed deployment mechanism can reduce 
the deployment cost by deploying fewer RSs at appreciate 
locations such that the contribution of each RS in rate 
enhancement can be maximized. Initially, a deployment 
scheme with minimal number of RS is proposed based on 
integer programming approach which takes into account 
the 802.16j draft frame structure and the available

In the second scenario, the latency between BS and CPi

In the next Section, we will propose a low-cost relay 
deployment mechanism which aims at achieving the goal 
presented in this Section and satisfying all constraints 
(13)-(21). 
B. Cost-Aware Relay Deployment (CARD) Mechanism 
This section introduces the proposed Cost-Aware 
Relay Deployment Mechanism (CARD). The mechanism 
aims to deploy as few as possible RSs at the appropriate 
locations such that the network capacity can support all 
traffic requirements of each CPi in each frame. The 
proposed CARD mainly consists of three phases. The first 
phase, called Promising Zone Construction Phase, aims 
to identify the Promising Zones, which are candidate 
zones for deploying RSs. The second phase, called 
Promising Zone Reduction Phase, further combines the 
adjacent subareas into a larger one aiming at reducing the 
computing complexity of later phases. The third phase, 
called Minimal Number of RS Allocation Phase, mainly 
allocates the minimal number of RSs to feasible Promising 
Zones and guarantees that the required transmission 
requirements can be satisfied. The detail operations 
designed in each phase is described as follows. 
a. Promising Zone Construction Phase  
Let Promising Zone zi denote the zone that deploying 
a RS within the zone can improve the transmission rate 
between CPi and BS. This phase aims at identifying the 
Promising Zone zi for each  CPi. In case that there does not 
exist the zone, it indicates that the CPi should directly 
connect to the BS. Identifying the Promising Zones can 
significantly reduce the computation complexity of the 
relay deployment problem. Two steps will be executed in 
this phase. First, the BS explores the feasible modulations 
and coding for RSs and CPs that can improve the 
transmission rate between CPi and BS. The second step is 
to construct the Promising Zone according to determined 
modulations.  
Recall that the deployment of a relay RSj can enhance 
the transmission rate only if the latency from CPi to BS 
through the relay forwarding should satisfy the constraint 
of expression (16). However, the transmission rates iCPBSr  , 
jRSBS
r   and ij CPRSr   are mainly determined by the SINR 
value at the receiver side, which are highly related to the 
distance between the sender and receiver. According to 
Table I, BS can adjust the modulation to maximize the 
transmission rate.  Let iCPBSm  , jRSBSm  and ij CPRSm  denote 
the modulation adopted between BS and CPi, BS and RSj, 
and RSj to CPi, respectively. Therefore, the transmission 
rates iCPBSr  , jRSBSr   and ij CPRSr  can be derived by 
expression (13). That is, given candidate placement 
location of a relay, BS can determine whether or not it is a 
feasible location. 
For a given location, although the BS is able to 
determine whether or not it is located in the Promising 
zone zi of BS and CPi, however, a big challenge to derive 
the Promising Zone is that the number of candidate 
locations are infinite. To derive the Promising Zone with a 
reasonable computing complexity, we consider the 
possible modulations that can be applied to the RSj. Let M 
be the number of predefined modulations in IEEE 802.16j 
standard. To reduce the computational cost, the first step 
considers the limited MM cases.

Fig. 17. An example of Promising Zone Construction for 
CP1.  
Let PZ denote the set of Promising Zones zi of all CPi. 
By applying the two steps of Promising Zone construction 
phase, the proposed CARD mechanism can identify 
Promising Zones PZ for all CPi. Figure 18 gives an 
example to illustrate the construction of Promising Zone. 
In Fig. 18, the proposed CARD mechanism executes the 
step construction procedure on ten CPs. Some CPs cannot 
produce the Promising Zone. The major reason is that 
these CPs obtain less throughput if they transmit data to 
the BS through relay stations.

Phase. 
b. Promising Zone Reduction Phase  
This section presents the Promising Zone Reduction 
phase which aims at eliminating Promising Zones for 
further reducing the computational cost of later phases. 
The main idea is to deploy a RS within the overlapped area 
of multiple Promising Zones such that one RS can serve 
multiple CPs. As shown in Fig. 20, by applying the 
Promising Zone Construction Phase as described in 
previous section, the BS constructs Promising Zones z1 
and z2 for CP1 and CP2, respectively. In case that one relay 
is deployed in each promising zone, two relays are 
required. However, the two zones intersect to form a small 
region which is marked by red shadow color. When a RS is 
deployed in the shadow region, it can commonly serve 
both CP1 and CP2. Instead of deploying one RS in each 
promising zone, deploying one RS in the shadow region 
can reduce the hardware cost of relay deployment.  
Let OΦ denote an overlapped area of a set of k 
Promising Zones z1,…,  zk, where Φ={1, …,k}.  Let 
AΦ={A1,…, Ak} denote the set of subareas whose 
corresponding Promising Zones z1,…, zk have a common 
overlapped area OΦ. Let RSZ denote the relay that will be 
deployed in the overlapped region OΦ. As shown in Fig. 
20, let RS1,2 to be the relay deployed in the overlapped 
region O1,2. Since RS1,2 fall in  z1 zone, it can satisfy the 
rate constraint as depicted in (6). That is, the time required 
for data transmissions from CP1 to BS through RS1,2 is 
smaller than that required for data transmission directly 
from CP1 to BS. Similarly, the RS1,2 also falls in z2  zone, 
which indicates that the RS1,2 is suitable to be a forwarder 
between CP2 and BS. As a result, the relay RS1,2 can serve 
all MSs fallen in both regions A1 and A2. Therefore, 
merging subareas A1 and A2 into a bigger area 
mergeA 2,1  can 
save one relay, as compared with the deployment policy 
that deploys one relay at each promising zone of z1 and z2. 
Let mergeΦA  denote the bigger area which merges all 
subareas in the set AΦ. To reduce the number of required 
relay, in this phase, a merging process will be developed 
for combining the set of k subareas AΦ={A1, …, Ak} to a 
bigger region mergekA },...,1{ . Then the Promising Zone 
Construction Phase should be again applied to derive the 
new promising zone of the merged subarea mergekA },...,1{ .

three new promising zone mergeZ1 , mergeZ2 and 
mergeZ3  for 
mergeCP1 , mergeCP2 and 
mergeCP3 , respectively. Figure 15 further 
gives three different deployments to illustrate the concept 
of the proposed algorithm. Assume each downlink interval 
TDL contains 256 slots. Consider the deployment (I) that 
none of RS is deployed in the network. That is, the BS can 
only directly communicates with each CP. Let the 
required transmission latencies req
CPBSt 1, , 
req
CPBSt 2, and 
req
CPBSt 3,  of 
links L(BS, CP1), L(BS, CP2) and L(BS, CP3) are 100, 70 
and 125 slots, respectively. As shown in Fig. 24, without 
deploying any RS, the total required transmission 
bandwidth are 295 slots/frame which is larger than 256 
slots. Therefore, the BS can not satisfy the downlink 
requirement. The deployment (II) depicts another relay 
deployment where each Promising Zone is deployed one 
RS. With the relay deployment, we assume that the 
latencies required for transmitting data from mergeCP1 , 
mergeCP2  and mergeCP3 to BS through RS are 70, 45 and 110 
slots, respectively. Thus the total transmission time of 
three CPs needs 225 (70+45+110) slots. As a result, the 
BS still have 31(256-225) available slots and thus the 
bandwidth utilization can be further improved. Compared 
with the deployments (I) and (II), deployment (III) is the 
best deployment. In deployment III, each relay is deployed 
in Promising Zones mergeZ1  and mergeZ2 , and thus only the 
data transmission rates of mergeCP1  and mergeCP2  are 
improved. Therefore, the total time required for 
transmitting from three CPs to BS needs 240(70+45+125) 
slots/frame. As a result,  the BS only remains 16(256-240) 
available slots. As compare to cases (I) and (II), the 
hardware cost of relays is reduced while the BS satisfies 
the required traffics.

Given a set of new Promising Zones ZM by applying 
the operations in previous two phases, the Minimal 
Number of RSs Allocation Phase aims to identify a subset 
Zsub of ZM such that deploying a relay at each promising 
zone subiZ Zsub can reduce the total number of RSs while 
the bandwidth of BS satisfies the traffic requirements of 
serving area A. Let CPsub denote the subset of CP 
coeresponding to Zsub. In order to minimize the number of 
RSs, the proposed algorithm aims at deploying RSs in the 
Promising Zones set Zsub which have better potential for 
increasing the network throughput. Let Tover denote the 
difference between the number of required slots when 
each CP directly transmits its data to BS and the number of 
slots in each frame. Exp. (25) evaluates the value of Tover.

5. Performance Study 
In the section, we investigate the performance of the 
proposed SADP algorithm and compare the proposed RPM 
and CARD with the existing relay deployment algorithms 
by apply the NS2 simulator.  
5.1 Experiment results of the Scheduling Algorithm 
with Dynamic Programming Approach (SADP). 
This section presents the performance investigation 
of the proposed efficient scheduling algorithm. The 
simulation environment is described as follows. The 
number of devices in the mesh network varies from 6 to 
10. These devices including a BS and several SSs are 
deployed in an area of 500 units * 500 units with uniform 
distribution. All SSs have a common transmission range. 
The traffic generated at each SS varies from 1MB to 
12MB. In physical layer, each node uses the same channel 
for transmission and adopts the OFDM burst profiles as 
shown in Table III. Based on the channel quality in the 
network; the BS could apply each SSs with a different and 
proper OFDM burst profile for data transmission.

In the experiments, the proposed SADP and HAS 
algorithms are compared with other three heuristic 
scheduling algorithms, namely Nearest Node to BS First 
and Farthest Node to BS First, as proposed in [5] and Node 
with Max Rate First. The Node with Max Rate First 
scheme prior selects the link with higher data rate for 
scheduling, while the Nearest Node to BS First and 
Farthest Node to BS First prior select the link whose 
transmitter has the minimal or maximal hop count to the 
BS for scheduling. 
Fig. 29 investigates the performance of the 
compared algorithms in terms of the average transmission 
delay. Since the length of routing path and the interference 
increase with the number of SSs in the network, the delay 
time generally increases with the number of SSs. The 
Farthest Node to BS First algorithm outperforms Nearest 
Node to BS First algorithm in case the number of SS is 10, 
while the Nearest Node to BS First algorithm outperforms 
Farthest Node to BS First algorithm in case the number of 
SS is 25. Therefore, the heuristic algorithms cannot always 
be optimal under different network environments. On the 
contrary, the proposed SADP exploits opportunities for 
parallel transmission and reduces the overall transmission 
time; hence it outperforms the other four compared 
algorithms in terms of average delay time.

Figure 34 investigates the network throughputs by 
applying the throughput-oriented (T-O) scheme and the 
proposed scheme. The number of RSs is varied from 1 to 6 
and the number of sub-regions is ranging from 25 to 200. 
Each simulation result is obtained by the average of 50 
experiments. In general, the network throughput increases 
with the number of RSs and the number of sub-regions. 
Note that the result simulated in the 125 sub-regions, the 
network throughput of proposed RPM scheme 
outperforms significantly than throughput-oriented (T-O) 
scheme as the number of RSs is larger than four. This also 
indicates that the network throughput can be significantly 
improved only when a suitable number of relays are 
deployed. However, we observe the results simulated in 
six relay stations, and throughput of the proposed RPM 
achieves optimal when the number of region reaches 150 
and the throughput keeps with a constant value even if the 
number of sub-regions increases. This is because that the 
traffic loads of the network exceed the maximal bandwidth 
limitation. Therefore, the network cannot sustain more 
traffic demands. Overall, the proposed RPM outperforms 
throughput-oriented (T-O) scheme in terms of throughput.

throughput-oriented (T-O) scheme in terms of network 
throughput versus the number of RSs and sub-regions. 
 
 
Figure 35 compares the proposed RPM with the other 
two mechanisms in terms of network capacity. The 
number of RSs is varied ranging from 1 to 6. Each result is 
obtained from the average of 50 experiments. In general, 
the network capacities of the three compared mechanisms 
increase with the number of RSs. However, the proposed 
scheme outperforms the other schemes in terms of the 
network capacity. The proposed RPM takes into 
consideration the frame constraint and bandwidth 
requirement constraint. As a result, the transmission time 
can be reduced and hence the network capacity can be 
significantly improved.

rate and thus reduce the required transmission delay. 
Figure 37 compares the transmission delay of the network 
with and without the relay deployment. The average traffic 
demand is varied from 1 to 10 Mbps. Three relay 
deployment mechanisms are compared. The three schemes 
with relay deployment outperform the network without 
relay deployment in terms of transmission delay. More, the 
proposed scheme by considering the frame constraint and 
bandwidth requirement constraint can further reduce the 
transmission delay required by the other two schemes.

Figure 41 further compares the proposed RPM with 
the other two relay-deployment mechanisms in terms of 
the average transmission delay. In general, the average 
transmission delay decreases with the relay traffics. This 
implies that the deployment of relay certainly increases the 
transmission rate between MS and BS. However, the relay 
traffic has no impact on the transmission delay when the 
relay traffic reaches 55%. The major reason is that the 
maximal bandwidth utilizations of relays have been 
achieved. In comparison, the proposed RPM mechanism 
outperforms T-O and Random mechanisms in terms of 
average transmission delay. Upon considering the frame 
structure constraint, we can select proper relay locations 
for maximizing network throughput.

Figure 42 exams the impact of grid size on both 
throughput and the average transmission delay. In the 
phase IV of our proposed algorithm, we partition the 
candidate-region into a set of equal-sized grids and then 
evaluate the network throughput and transmission delay of 
each grid where a relay station is deployed. In general, a 
smaller grid size will result in a higher network throughput 
and lower average transmission delay. However, when the 
grid size reaches 50m, the performance of throughput and 
average transmission delay drops off significantly. The 
simulation result indicates that a careful decision on the 
grid size is important for increasing the network 
throughput and reducing the transmission delay.

5.3. Cost-Aware Relay Deployment (CARD) 
Mechanism 
This section presents the performance evaluation of 
the proposed relay deployment mechanism. The proposed 
CARD mechanism is compared with Random scheme 
which randomly deploys RSs in the Promising Zones. The 
proposed CARD mechanism also compares with the 
existing approaches proposed by studies [12] and [13] 
which are referred to as TM-RSP and RPM, respectively. 
The simulator NS2 is used to evaluate the three compared 
deployment mechanisms. Table IV gives the experiment 
parameters considered in the simulation.

System bandwidth 20 MHz

Fig. 43 is a screenshot of the considered environment 
where the region size is set to 10 km ×10 km. One BS is 
deployed at the center of the service region, and the 
locations of 10 CPs are randomly determined. The average 
traffic requirement of all CPs is set by 7 Mbps. In the Fig. 
20, the regions marked by light gray and dark gray colors 
denote the promising zones of CPs with modulation pairs 
(16QAM2/3, 16QAM 2/3) and (16QAM 3/4, 16QAM 
1/2), respectively. The intersection zone of neighboring 
CPs is marked by yellow color.

Fig. 46. The relation between the average required rate and 
the number of RSs in the networks. 
Figure 47 further investigates the average 
transmission delay by applying the proposed CARD and 
the other three schemes. The traffic requirement of each 
CP ranges between 5 and 15 Mbps. At the beginning, the 
average transmission delay is high. However, the average 
transmission delay is decreased with the increase of the 
number of RSs. This result reveals that deploying RSs at 
the appreciate locations can improve the network 
throughput and hence the delay can be significantly 
reduced. In general, our proposed CARD outperforms the 
other three schemes in terms of the transmission delay. 
Notice that when the number of RS is six, the transmission 
delay of CARD cannot be further improved. This is 
because that the deployment of six relays has satisfied the 
transmission requirements. To achieve the same 
transmission delay with the proposed CARD, the TM-RSP, 
RPM and Random schemes need to deploy more RSs. This 
is because that the other three mechanisms cannot deploy 
the relays at the best location where more CPs can share 
the same relay. Furthermore, the Random scheme results 
in longer transmission delay than the proposed CARD, 
TM-RSP and RPM because that some RSs are deployed in 
the improper locations.

other three schemes in terms of average transmission delay

Figure 48 further investigates the performance of four 
compared mechanisms in terms of the satisfactory index of 
QoS requirements of CPs. Let |C| denote the number of 
CPs. Let ω denote the number of CPs whose QoS 
requirements are satisfied by the deployment of relays. 
Exp. (27) defines the QoS Satisfaction Index λ.  
 C
   (27)
The larger value of λ means that more traffic requirements 
of CPs are satisfied from the currently deployed relay. 
Simulation environment applied in this investigation is 
similar to Fig 43. The average traffic requirement of all 
CPs is 7 Mbps and the traffic requirement of each CP is 
ranging from 5 to 10 Mbps. In general, the value of λ is 
increased with the number of RSs. When the number of 
deployed relays is small, most QoS requirements of CPs 
cannot be satisfied. When the number of deployed RSs is 
enough, the value of λ achieves one which indicates that 
the traffic requirements of all CPs are satisfactory. In 
general, the proposed CARD mechanism outperforms the 
other three deployment schemes. This is because that the 
CARD determines the locations for deploying RSs with 
better relay benefit. In addition, the compared TM-RSP, 
RPM and Random schemes have to deploy more RSs than 
the proposed CARD to satisfy the QoS requirements of all 
CPs. The major reason is that the proposed CARD 
mechanism considers the relay benefit and the most 
feasible locations. The proposed CARD deploys the relay 
with the largest value of relay benefit and thus more QoS 
requirements of CPs can be satisfied.

Figure 49 measures the calculation time required for 
constructing the Promising Zone by applying the proposed 
Promising Zone construction phase and Brute Force 
method. Since the Brute Force method considers each 
possible location and checks whether or not deploying one 
RS at that location can satisfy the constraint (6). 
Consequently, it consumes a considerable of time. Recall 
that the proposed CARD in PZC phase can collect all 
feasible modulation pairs and then partition the 
communication regions of BS and each CP into several 
coronas. Hence, the promising zone can be constructed by 
the intersection of BS’ corona and CP’s corona. The 
modulation pair applied to a certain promising zone 
indicates the fact that deploying the relay at any location of 
the zone will have the identical benefit. Therefore, the 
proposed CARD does not check all locations of a 
promising zone. Compared with the Brute Force method, 
the operations designed in Promising Zone construction 
phase significantly reduces the computing time.

Abstract 
Recently, many location-aware routing protocols 
have been proposed to overcome the obstacles and 
construct the shortest route which minimizes the 
end-to-end delay and saves overheads for packet 
forwarding. However, most of them require accurate 
location information which is difficult to obtain. 
Another problem of existing location aware routing 
is that the sensor nodes located on the best route will 
frequently execute the packet forwarding and result 
in an energy-unbalanced problem. This phenomenon 
is especially significant when the WSNs contain 
obstacle. It is because that the border nodes around 
the obstacle are always in charge of packet 
forwarding. Joint consideration of localization and 
routing mechanism can improve the routing 
performance since the development of routing 
mechanism should take into consideration the degree 
of inaccurate location information which is 
determined by localization mechanism. This paper 
proposes a localization algorithm that uses mobile 
sensor with direction antenna to guarantee a specific 
accurate level of location information. A novel 
routing protocol which takes both energy balance 
and obstacle resistance issues into consideration is 
proposed to work with the proposed localization 
mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this is the 
pilot study that integrates localization and routing 
mechanisms and considers both energy balance and 
obstacle resistance issues based on an environment 
with inaccurate location information. Performance 
study shows that the proposed routing protocol 
outperforms other existing routing protocols in 
terms of energy balancing and packet delivery ratio. 
 
Keywords: WSNs; routing protocol; energy balancing; 
inaccurate location information; obstacles. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
In a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), obstacles can 
be dynamically formed due to several reasons. First, the 
random deployment causes a non-uniform distribution of 
WSN where some region might not contain any sensor 
node. Second, some sensor nodes exhaust their energy 
after working for a relative long period of time, resulting 
in some region without functionality of sensing and 
communication. Third, physical obstacle such as 
mountains or buildings also can be treated as an obstacle 
which potentially blocks communications. Fourth, all 
sensor nodes in some region could not normally work 
owing to the animus signal interference. Finally, groups 
of animals passing or strong breeze blowing the WSN 
also cause some sensor nodes failure or sweeping away, 
dynamically forming an obstacle. A number of 
location-aware routing protocols [1][2][3] that take 
obstacles into consideration have been proposed in the 
past few years. However, most of them require accurate 
location information. Although a vast amount of 
localization algorithms have been proposed, it is still 
difficult to obtain accurate location information for each 
node in WSN. The packet delivery ratio of routing 
protocols [1][2][3] might be significantly dropped when 
the location information is inaccurate.  
Another major problem of existing location-aware 
routing is the energy-balance problem. Sensor nodes 
located on the best route will frequently execute the 
packet forwarding and thus result in an 
energy-unbalanced problem. This phenomenon is 
especially significant when the WSNs contain obstacle. 
It is because that the border nodes around the obstacle 
are always in charge of packet forwarding. The 
energy-unbalanced problem will further cause network 
partition which blocks the packet transmission from 
sensors to sink node.  
Studies [4][5] propose the path discovery algorithms 
to find the minimal energy-consumption paths to 
prolong the network lifetime. However, both [4] and [5] 
create significant control overheads to find an optimal 
path. The optimal path might be an ineffective path if the 
sensor node located on such path exhausts its energy. 
Therefore, study [6] developed an energy-balanced 
routing algorithm to establish a dynamic path according 
to the remaining energy of next hop. However, it does 
not take obstacles or holes into consideration. A packet 
which encounters the concave region of an obstacle or 
hole will be blocked in the region when greedy 
forwarding is failed. Therefore, how to develop a 
location-aware routing that overcomes the obstacle and 
balances the energy consumption of sensors is an 
important issue and requires more efforts. 
This paper proposes an energy-balanced and 
obstacle-resisted routing protocol, named JLR, which 
minimizes the number of forwarding border nodes to 
reduce the influence of energy unbalanced problem. To 
the best of our knowledge, the proposed JLR is the first 
protocol that takes energy balance and obstacle 
 forwarding candidates with maximum remaining energy 
to balance the energy consumption. The energy 
awareness to neighboring cells can be done by 
information exchange with neighbors. However, the 
information of remaining energy is changed after a period 
of time. Therefore, the periodically information exchange 
is necessary for each node. 
3.2 Obstacle Resistance 
In a WSN, obstacles can be dynamically formed in a 
WSN due to several reasons. An obstacle is regarded as a 
hole or a physical obstacle that might influence the 
routing path. The proposed JLR actively detects the 
existed obstacles and establishes the forbidden regions to 
prevent the packet from entering the concave region. To 
establish the forbidden region, each permitted cell (since 
there is only one active sensor in a cell, we let the cell 
denotes the active sensor for ease of exposition), say C1, 
checks whether or not it has two adjacent neighboring 
forbidden cells. If it is the case, cell C1 switches its state to 
forbidden cell and broadcasts its new state to its four 
neighboring cells. Upon receiving the message from cell 
C1, each neighboring cell checks whether or not itself is a 
new forbidden cell. If it is the case, the cell does the 
similar task of cell C1. The forbidden region is 
constructed until all forbidden identification tasks of the 
cells finished. As shown in Fig. 2, the cell C3 becomes a 
new forbidden cell since two adjacent neighboring cells 
C4 and C5 are forbidden cells. Upon receiving the new 
state message from cell C3, the cell C6 switches its state to 
forbidden cell since cells C3 and C7 are both forbidden 
cells. The forbidden region is consisted of forbidden cells 
and formed into a rectangle. 
The following presents the four cases of different 
locations of source and destination. 
Case 1: Permitted Cell to Permitted Cell 
In this case, the source and destination are both located 
at the permitted cell. If no forbidden region is located at 
the path from source to destination, the path is an 
energy-balanced path. However, the forbidden region 
might cause the failure of a permitted cell, say Ci, in 
finding forwarding cell. This is because the cell Ci has 
only one forwarding candidate and the candidate is a 
forbidden cell. We call such permitted cell as a dead end 
and it belongs to the boundary of a forbidden region. The 
direction of a dead end towards its forwarding candidate 
called failure vector. Notice that only the dead end holds 
the failure vector. In such case, the routing mode is 
switched from Energy Balancing Mode to Bypassing 
Mode by cell Ci. The cell Ci further rotates its failure 
vector with counterclockwise and selects the first visited 
permitted cell, say Cj, as the forwarding cell. Upon 
receiving the packet in Bypassing Mode, the permitted 
cell checks whether or not all of its forwarding candidates 
are permitted cells and don’t contain the sender. If it is the 
case, the packet delivery isn’t get influenced by the 
forbidden region and the routing mode is switched back 
to Energy Balancing Mode. Otherwise, the cell Cj rotates 
line i jC C  and selects the first visited permitted cell as 
the forwarding cell. Notice that the packet won’t be sent 
to the forwarding candidate which contains the previous 
sender. As shown in Fig. 2, the sensor s1 intends to send a 
packet to sensor s5. The packet delivery is in Energy 
Balancing Mode from sensor s1 to s3. When the sensor s3 
fails to select the forwarding cell due to forbidden region, 
it rotates its failure vector counterclockwise and chooses 
the first visited neighboring cell C8 as the forwarding cell. 
When the packet arrives at cell C9, the routing mode is 
switched back to Energy Balancing Mode again since all 
forwarding candidates of cell C9 are permitted cells. 
Case 2: Permitted Cell to Forbidden Cell 
The forbidden region is constructed to prevent the 
packet from entering the concave region. However, the 
packet should enter the forbidden region if the destination 
is inside. Therefore, the permitted cell has to determine 
whether or not the destination is inside the forbidden 
region. Since the forbidden region is a rectangle and it 
contains the destination, there are four dead ends that 
belong to the boundary of forbidden region. As shown in 
Fig. 3, the cells C2, C3, C4 and C5 are dead ends and their 
failure vectors are right, down, left and up, respectively. 
One of the dead ends switches the routing mode from 
Energy Balancing Mode to Bypassing Mode when the 
packet passes through it. However, the packet cannot be 
sent into the forbidden region to destination if the 
Bypassing Mode is applied. The packet will be sent 
around the forbidden region and passes through four dead 
ends again and again. To reduce the routing path and raise 
the packet delivery ratio, the destination should be 
determined whether or not it is inside the forbidden 
region as faster as the permitted cell can. Therefore, the 
dead end plays an important role to determine the location 
of the destination.

Figure 3. An example of the destination-location 
determination of the dead end. 
Initially, the routing mode is switched to Bypassing 
Mode by first visited dead end, say Ci. The cell Ci cannot 
determine the location of destination since the situation 
also matches the case in case 1. Therefore, the packet will 
be sent to next forwarding cell. Upon receiving the packet 
in Bypassing Mode, the second dead end, say Cj, has two 
possible cases. First, the destination isn’t inside the 
forbidden region that cell Ci belongs to. In this case, the 
failure vector of cell Ci is same as cell Cj. The cell Ci and 
Cj belong to different forbidden regions. Therefore, the 
packet delivery is switched to Energy Balancing Mode to 
prepare for the bypassing of another forbidden region. 
Second, the destination is inside the forbidden region that 
cell Ci belongs to. In this case, the failure vector of cell Ci 
is different from cell Cj since they belong to the same 
forbidden region. Figure 3 shows an example of two 
 simulation for Energy Balancing Index (EBI for short) is 
worked without the obstacle. The EBI denotes the 
average remaining energy of a cell that the packet passes 
through. The larger value of EBI represents the less 
energy consumption load of a cell for relaying a packet. 
We randomly select 100 pairs of source and destination to 
evaluate the average EBI. Figure 5 depicts the 
comparison of three routing protocols in terms of EBI. 
Since the existence of obstacle is not considered in this 
simulation, the GPSR is same as the Greedy Forwarding 
Routing. Therefore, the selection of next hop is 
considered for shorter route but not for energy balancing. 
The EBI of LEBR is similar as the JLR since both of them 
select the sensor with most remaining energy as the 
forwarding node from the forwarding candidates. On the 
other hand, the density of the sensor for a cell is direct 
proportion with the number of sensor nodes. Therefore, 
the EBIs of all routing protocols are increased when the 
energy sum of a cell get larger.

Figure 6. The comparison of three routing protocols in 
terms of the packet delivery ratio. 
The second simulation compares the packet delivery 
ratios of three routing protocols in the network 
environment with an obstacle. The performance result is 
obtained from the average results of 100 randomly 
selected pairs of source and destination. As shown in Fig. 
6, the JLR outperforms than the GPSR and LEBR in 
terms of packet delivery ratio since the JLR has 
considered working with the inaccurate location 
information. The constructed face graph of the GPSR 
generates the crossing links with inaccurate location 
information that the obstacle resistance performance of 
the GPSR is reduced. Since the LEBR considers neither 
working with the inaccurate location information nor 
obstacle resistance, the packet delivery ratio of LEBR is 
worse than the JLR.

Figure 7. The comparison of three routing protocols in 
terms of EI. 
Figure 7 shows the comparison of three routing 
protocols in terms of Efficient Index (EI for short). The 
EI denotes the score of a routing protocol that is evaluated 
by following expression: 
H
R EBIEI , (1)
where R denotes the packet delivery ratio while H 
denotes the average number of hop count. The EI is a 
score that represents the better EBI, the better packet 
delivery ratio and the shorter path length. Figure 7 shows 
that the JLR outperforms than the GPSR and LEBR in 
terms of EI. The more sensor nodes deployed the more 
differences between the EI of JLR and other routing 
protocols. Although the packet delivery ratio of LEBR is 
better than GPSR, however, the hop count of GPSR is 
less than LEBR. Therefore, the EI of two routing 
protocols are similar to each other. 
Figures 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c) depict the scenarios of 
three routing protocols in terms of traffic load, 
respectively. Since the LEBR didn’t take obstacle 
resistance into consideration, the network environment of 
Figs. 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c) contains no obstacles. The 
source that located at top-left sends 100 packets to the 
destination that located at the bottom-right of the 
monitoring field. Each black line denotes a routing path 
while the color depth denotes the traffic load. The more 
depth of a line, the more traffic load of a path. Figures 
8(a) and 8(b) show that the traffic load is separated to the 
entire network whereas the traffic load in Fig. 8(c) is 
aggregated at a path. Therefore, the energy balancing is 
achieved in Figs. 8(a) and 8(b) since the traffic load is 
separated. Compare the result of Fig. 8(a) with 8(b), the 
routing paths of JLR have been separated to entire 
monitoring field while the LEBR has some sensors that 
located at the bottom-left didn’t participate the packet 
delivery. Therefore, the EBI of JLR is better than the 
LEBR.
