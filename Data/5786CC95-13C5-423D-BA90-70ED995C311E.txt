Abstract 
 
There are two themes in this project.  One is 
quantum state identification and the other is 
quantum error correction.  In the first year 
of this project, we have successfully provided 
a rigorous mathematical proof for a property 
stated in the literature which certifies the 
feasibility of a set of state identification 
efficiencies and have established an explicit 
construction of the POVM measurement for 
any prescribed set of feasible identification 
efficiencies. We have also successfully 
established the design methods of optimal 
quantum measurement under two state 
identification design criteria -- the mini-max 
criterion and the minimum averaged failure 
probability.  In the second- third years of 
this project, we have developed a new but 
simple construction of quantum stabilizer 
codes by classical parity-check matrices 
which satisfy a specific commutative 
condition. The designed minimum distance 
2t*+1 of the constructed quantum stabilizer 
codes can be achieved by a commutative 
classical parity- check matrix with classical 
minimum distance $4t*-m$, where the 
parameter m, 0<= m<= 2t*, depends on a 
property of the parity-check matrix. The 
(asymptotic) coding efficiency is at least 
comparable to that of CSS codes. A class of 
quantum Reed-Muller codes is constructed 
and codes in this class have a larger set of 
correctable error operators than that of the 
quantum Reed-Muller codes previously 
developed in the literature. Quantum 
circulant codes are also constructed and 
many of them are optimal in terms of their 
coding parameters.

lem, the quantum probabilistic cloning prob-
lem. If the input is known to be chosen from
a set of selected states, a probabilistic cloning
machine is able to make copies with a success
probability or to give a failure result. Being
able to make copies of a state does not neces-
sarily imply being able to know what exactly
the state is. However, if we can make in-
finitely many faithful copies, the state can be
determined by applying an arbitrary detec-
tor for infinitely many times. This connection
was discussed by Duan and Guo in [14]. They
showed that linear independence is a neces-
sary and sufficient condition for probabilisti-
cally copying a set of states. Furthermore,
they gave a necessary and sufficient condi-
tion for a set of states to be probabilistically
cloned into k faithful copies with certain ef-
ficiencies, and extended this result to unam-
biguous discrimination problem without given
a mathematical proof.
Let {|ψi〉, |ψ2〉, . . . , |ψm〉} be a set of lin-
early independent states with a priori proba-
bilities η1, η2, . . . , ηm, respectively. Suppose
each state |ψi〉 can be unambiguously dis-
criminated with probability pi for 1 ≤ i ≤ m,
the minimal average inconclusive probability
criterion is to minimize the weighted ”fail-
ure” probability
m∑
i=1
ηi(1− pi), or equivalently
to maximize
m∑
i=1
ηipi. However, other crite-
ria can be considered. The minimax crite-
rion is discussed in [15] for both detection and
unambiguous discrimination problems. This
criterion is to maximize min
i
pi, hence the de-
tection efficiency of each state can be assured
not too small.
In the first year of this project, we fo-
cus on the study of quantum state identifica-
tion. We have successfully provided a rigor-
ous mathematical proof for a property stated
in the literature which certifies the feasibility
of a set of state identification efficiencies and
have established an explicit construction of
the POVM measurement for any prescribed
set of feasible identification efficiencies. We
have also successfully established the design
methods of optimal quantum measurement
under two state identification design criteria
– the mini-max criterion and the minimum
averaged failure probability.

Codes
A bit represents the logic state of a classi-
cal computation and has state 0 or 1. Like the
conception of a classical bit, a quantum bit
(qubit) represents the state of a 2-dimensional
quantum system. The state of a qubit, usu-
ally denoted by |ψ〉, is a unit vector in a
2-dimensional Hilbert space H with an (or-
dered) orthonormal basis {|0〉, |1〉}. That is,
|ψ〉 = α|0〉+ β|1〉 or |ψ〉 =
[
α
β
]
,
where α and β are complex numbers and |α|2+
|β|2 = 1.
The evolution of a closed quantum system
is described by a unitary transformation. If
the state suffers some operation U , the state
becomes U |ψ〉. It is known that the Pauli
matrices
I =
[
1 0
0 1
]
, X =
[
0 1
1 0
]
, Y =
[
0 −i
i 0
]
, Z =
[
1 0
0 −1
]
,
which are unitary, Hermitian and anti-commute
to each other, form a basis of the vector space
of all linear operators on H.
As for an n-qubit composite system, the
Hilbert space of all n-qubit states is denoted
by H⊗ . . .⊗H = H⊗n and the joint state is
|ψ1〉⊗ . . .⊗|ψn〉, where |ψi〉 is the state of the
i-th qubit. For simplicity, let the operator
with a Pauli matrix acting on the i-th qubit
and identity matrices acting on the others be
denoted by the Pauli matrix with a subscript
i.
The evolution of the quantum system can
be described as a quantum operation E on a
3
After the CSS code construction developed
in [36,37], a lot of works were dedicated to the
study of classical self-orthogonal codes and
the corresponding quantum codes.
In [38], the idea of stabilizer codes was
proposed. The properties of stabilizer codes
have been developed in [39, 40]. CSS codes
then can be viewed as one useful class of sta-
bilizer codes with simple and efficient encod-
ing and decoding algorithms. In [41], Steane
gave a further improvement, called an en-
largement of CSS codes, which gives several
families of quantum codes with longer mini-
mum distance.
In [43], the authors gave a new but natural
point of view on stabilizer codes. The prob-
lem of finding binary stabilizer codes is trans-
formed into an equivalent problem of find-
ing certain special additive codes over GF(4).
During the early 1990s, there are quite a few
researches on classical quaternary codes and
classical additive codes. Thus several classi-
cal codes are transformed into quantum codes
by the theory in [43]. As a result, many clas-
sical coding techniques can be used in the
quantum coding theory.
In the second and third years of this project,
we have developed a new but simple construc-
tion of quantum stabilizer codes is proposed
based on syndrome assignment by classical
parity-check matrices. This method turns the
construction of quantum stabilizer codes to
the construction of classical parity-check ma-
trices satisfying a specific commutative condi-
tion. The designed minimum distance 2t∗+1
of the constructed quantum stabilizer codes
can be achieved by a commutative classical
parity-check matrix with classical minimum
distance 4t∗ − m, where the parameter m,
0 ≤ m ≤ 2t∗, depends on a property of the
parity-check matrix. As m decreases, there is
an increasing set of additional correctable er-
ror operators beyond the designed error cor-
recting capability t∗. The (asymptotic) cod-
ing efficiency is at least comparable to that of
CSS codes. A class of quantum Reed-Muller
codes is constructed and codes in this class
have a larger set of correctable error operators
than that of the quantum Reed-Muller codes
previously developed in the literature. Quan-
tum circulant codes are also constructed and
many of them are optimal in terms of their
coding parameters.

The First Year (2007/08/01 –
2008/07/31): Quantum State
Identification
2.1 Quantum Measurement
To observe what state a quantum system is
in, we make use of quantum measurement.
The measurement operation will interact with
the quantum system and make the system no
longer closed.
A quantum measurement is described by
a set {Mm} of measurement operators, where
index m refers to the measurement outcome.
If the state before measurement is |ψ〉, then
the probability that outcomem occurs is given
by
pm = 〈ψ|M †mMm|ψ〉,
and the state after measurement is
|ψ′〉 = Mm|ψ〉√
〈ψ|M †mMm|ψ〉
.
The measurement operators must satisfy
the completeness relation∑
m
M †mMm = I,
for the reason that the probabilities sum to
one ∑
m
pm =
∑
m
〈ψ|M †mMm|ψ〉 = 1.
A simple example of quantum measure-
ment is to measure the state of a qubit in a
5
greater than m. This is because we can have
other reciprocal states |ψ˜′i〉 = |ψ˜i〉 + |µ〉 for
any |µ〉 ∈ U⊥. However, without loss of gen-
erality, we assume the dimension r to bem, or
equivalently, H is the Hilbert space spanned
by the set of states S. With this assumption,
the reciprocal state |ψ˜i〉 and the correspond-
ing projector |ψ˜i〉〈ψ˜i| are unique.
2.3 Reciprocal States
The unnormalized reciprocal states |ψ̂i〉 =
1
κ∗i
|ψ˜i〉, which satisfies 〈ψ̂i|ψk〉 = δik, can be
derived as follows [11]. Let Ψ and Ψ̂ denote
the m×m matrices whose columns ψi and ψ̂i
are the coordinate vectors of |ψi〉 and |ψ̂i〉, re-
spectively, relative to a basis of H. From the
equation Ψ̂†Ψ = I, we have
Ψ̂ = (Ψ†)−1
= (ΨΨ†)−1Ψ,
where Ψ† is invertible since the set {|ψi〉} of
states is a linearly independent set. So that
ψ̂i = (ΨΨ
†)−1ψi.
Here we have to mention the singular value
decomposition (SVD) of Ψ = UΣV †, where
U and V are unitary matrices and Σ is a
diagonal matrix with diagonal entries being
the singular values of Ψ. All singular val-
ues of Ψ are positive since the columns of Ψ
are linearly independent. We can decompose
G = Ψ†Ψ and S = ΨΨ† as follows:
G = Ψ†Ψ = V Σ†ΣV † = V Σ2V †,
S = ΨΨ† = UΣΣ†U † = UΣ2U †.
The diagonal entries σ2i of Σ
2 are eigenvalues
of G and S, which are all positive, and the
columns of V and U are eigenvectors of G
and S, respectively.
In the next section, we will show that the
reciprocal states and the normalizing coeffi-
cients can be calculated by an equivalent pro-
cedure using the Gram-Schmidt orthogonal-
ization process. The normalizing coefficients
will be shown to be
κi =
√
|Gm|
|G(i)m−1|
for i = 1, 2, . . . ,m, where | · | denotes the de-
terminant of a matrix, Gm is the Gram matrix
of {|ψj〉, 1 ≤ j ≤ m} and G(i)m−1 is the Gram
matrix of {|ψj〉, 1 ≤ j ≤ m, j 6= i}.

– 2010/10/31): Quantum Stablizer
Codes
2.4 Stabilizer Codes
Let H be the state space of a qubit. The
Pauli group Gn, acting on the state spaceH⊗n
of n qubits, plays an important role in the
construction of n-qubit stabilizer codes. An
element in Gn is expressed as icM1 ⊗ M2 ⊗
. . . ⊗Mn, where each Mj is one of the Pauli
operators I, X, Y , or Z on H, i = √−1,
and c ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}. Let K = {±I⊗n,±iI⊗n},
which is a normal subgroup of Gn and will be
used in a later discussion.
For a g ∈ Gn, the fixed subspace V(g) of
g is a subspace of H⊗n such that |ψ〉 ∈ V(g)
if and only if g|ψ〉 = |ψ〉. A stabilizer group
S that fixes a non-trivial subspace T of H⊗n
is the set
S = {g ∈ Gn |g|ψ〉 = |ψ〉, ∀|ψ〉 ∈ T } .
A necessary condition is that −I /∈ S. Since
any g, h ∈ Gn have either gh = hg or gh =
−hg, S must be an abelian subgroup of Gn.
And since any g ∈ Gn has either g2 = I or
g2 = −I, we have g2 = I ∀g ∈ S. Therefore,
S ∼= (Z2)r for some r, i.e., S =< g1, g2, . . . , gr >
with r commutative independent generators.
An [[n, k, d]] quantum stabilizer code C(S)
is a 2k-dimensional subspace of H⊗n fixed by
a stabilizer group S with a set of r = n−k in-
dependent generators. The d means the min-
imum distance of the quantum code C(S) and
7
Since a stabilizer group S is an abelian
group, we have gh = hg ∀g, h ∈ S, which has
a corresponding property in ϕ(S), induced by
the homomorphism ϕ, that
ϕ(g)Λ2nϕ(h) = 0, ∀g, h ∈ S,
where Λ2n =
[
On×n In×n
In×n On×n
]
. Thus a check
matrixH of a stabilizer group S has to satisfy
the following commutative condition,
HΛ2nH
T = HXH
T
Z +HZH
T
X = Or×r, (3)
where Oi×j is the i × j zero matrix. We will
omit the subscripts of Λ and O in the follow-
ing discussion. We define that an r × 2n bi-
nary matrix H = [HX |HZ ] is commutative if
it satisfies the commutative condition. From
(3), an r×2n binary matrix H = [HX |HZ ] is
commutative if and only if HXH
T
Z is a sym-
metric r × r matrix.
The check matrix is a convenient tool for
the encoding and decoding of stabilizer codes
[40]. In addition, the check matrix is able to
facilitate the construction of stabilizer groups
from known classical binary codes, as will
be demonstrated in the next section. Be-
fore that, we will illustrate an application of
the check matrix of a stabilizer group to de-
termine the minimum distance of the corre-
sponding stabilizer code as follows.
Let S¯ = ϕ(S), which is a subspace of Z2n2 .
Then S¯ can be viewed as a classical binary
code with generator matrix H. As in [39,43],
we define a symplectic inner product ∗ on Z2n2
by
(u1, v1) ∗ (u2, v2) , u1 · v2 + v1 · u2.
Thus, two elements g, h in Gn is commutative
if and only if the symplectic inner product
ϕ(g) ∗ ϕ(h) of ϕ(g) and ϕ(h) is zero. Let
S¯⊥∗ be the dual code of S¯ with respect to the
symplectic inner product,
S¯⊥∗ = {(u, v) ∈ Z2n2 |(u, v) ∗ (α, β) = 0,
∀(α, β) ∈ S¯}.
It is clear that S¯ is a self-orthogonal code with
respect to this symplectic inner product, i.e.,
S¯ ⊂ S¯⊥∗. An (2n− r)× 2n binary matrix
G =
[
GX |GZ
]
of rank 2n− r, where GX and GZ are (2n −
r)× n binary matrices, is a generator matrix
of S¯⊥∗ if and only if
HΛGT = HXG
T
Z +HZG
T
X = O. (4)
It can be seen that S¯⊥∗ = ϕ(N(S)) and the
minimum distance of C(S) is just the mini-
mum generalized weight of a nonzero code-
word in S¯⊥∗ \ S¯. This helps decide the min-
imum distance of a stabilizer code, as illus-
trated in the construction of CSS codes [36,
37] and their enlargement [41] as follows.
To construct an [[n, k, d]] CSS code C(S),
we choose a classical [n, k1] binary code C1
and an [n, k2] subcode C2 of C1 such that both
the code C1 and the classical dual code of C2
have minimum distance > d. Then a check
matrix of a stabilizer group S is established as
H =
[
G2|O
O |H1
]
, of rank n − k1 + k2, where
G2 is a generator matrix of C2 and H1 is a
parity-check matrix of C1. The minimum dis-
tance of the quantum code is no less than the
minimum generalized weight of the symplec-
tic dual code S¯⊥∗ with a generator matrix
G =
[
G1 O
O H2
]
, where G1 is a generator
matrix of C1 and H2 is a parity-check matrix
of C2, and is > d. The dimension of the quan-
tum code is k = n− (n− k1 + k2) = k1 − k2.
The enlargement of CSS codes in [41] is
based on the CSS construction and exchanges
code dimension for error-correcting capabil-
ity. With additional stabilizer generators, this
enlargement increases the minimum distance
of the code by half. Let C1 be a classical
[n, k1, d1] binary code which contains its clas-
sical dual C⊥1 . Furthermore, let C1 be able to
be enlarged to C2 = [n, k2, d2], where k2 > k1.
Suppose that G1, G2 =
(
G1
G3
)
are genera-
tor matrices of C1, C2, respectively, and H2,
9
and let Gk, 1 ≤ k < 4, be the Gram ma-
trix of {|ψi〉, 1 ≤ i ≤ k}, or equivalently, the
principal k-by-k submatrix of G4.
After applying the Gram-Schmidt proce-
dure, we have an orthonormal basis
|θ1〉 = |ψ1〉
|θ2〉 = −a√|G2| |ψ1〉+ 1√|G2| |ψ2〉

y = −e+ |b|2e+ a∗d+ cf − a∗bf − b∗cd
z = −f + |a|2f + b∗d+ c∗e− ab∗e− a∗c∗d.
Additionally, each state |ψj〉 can be expressed
as a linear combination of the orthonormal
states {|θi〉, i ≤ i ≤ m},

fact, we will later show that for the generalm-
state case, κm =

|Gm−1| . Furthermore, let

|ψi+1〉, . . . , |ψm〉}, then κi =

.
Recall that Ψ is the matrix with the coor-
dinate vectors of |ψi〉’s as its columns. Let Θ
be the matrix with the coordinate vectors of
|θi〉’s as its columns and remember that {|θi〉}
is an orthonormal basis obtained from {|ψi〉}
by the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization pro-
cedure. Then Gm = Ψ
†Ψ and Θ†Θ = I. Fur-
thermore, we can find a transition matrix Vm
such that ΨVm = Θ, and thus V
†
mGmVm = I.
The transition matrix Vm can be built from
the Gram-Schmidt procedure, or by the ele-
mentary row and column operations. For in-

It is obvious that Vm is invertible, so Ψ =

†V −1m . By Gram-Schmidt
procedure, we know that Vm is an upper tri-
angular matrix. Thus V −1m is also an upper
triangular matrix and hence (V †m)

is lower triangular. In addition, the Gram
matrix Gm is a positive-definite matrix due to
the linear independence of states |ψi〉. Thus
the decomposition Gm = (V

to be the Cholesky decomposition of Gm.
3.3 Cholesky Decomposition and

Let A be a positive-definite matrix. Then A
can be decomposed as
A = LL†,
where L is a lower triangular matrix with
strictly positive diagonal entries. This is called

which is equal to the last column of Gm− P .
Consider the other columns of [Π0]S. Sim-
ilarly, the jth column of [Π0]S will only relate
to Πj. Since Πj is constructed by reordering
the states in S and then applying the same
procedure in Subsection 3.1, we can find that
the jth column of Gm[Π0]S is equal to the
jth column of Gm − P for 1 ≤ j ≤ m − 1
by analogous argument. Thus every column
of Gm[Π0]S can be shown to be equal to the
corresponding column of Gm−P . The lemma
is proved. 2
The Gram matrix Gm and the measure-
ment operator Π0 in Lemma 3 are not com-
mute in general. However, we can still prove
that Π0 ≥ 0 if and only if Gm − P ≥ 0.
Recall a POVM measurement for unam-
biguously discriminating states |ψ1〉, |ψ2〉, . . . , |ψm〉
is given by M = {Π0,Π1, . . . ,Πm}, where
Πi =
pi

m∑
i=1
Πi ≥ 0. Let an efficiency vector be an
m-tuple (p1, p2, . . . , pm) ∈ Rm such that 0 ≤
pi ≤ 1. An efficiency vector is called feasible
if there exists a POVMM = {Π0,Π1, . . . ,Πm}
such that the states |ψ1〉, |ψ2〉, . . . , |ψm〉 can
be unambiguously discriminated with efficien-
cies p1, p2, . . . , pm, respectively by M .

linearly independent, then fS(E

t∗ and (a, b) 6= (u, v) and then the target sta-
bilizer code will have minimum distance at
least 2t∗ + 1. This corresponds to a prop-
erty of a parity-check matrix of a classical lin-
ear block code with minimum distance d′ >
4t∗+1, where any d′−1 column vectors of the
parity-check matrix must be linearly indepen-
dent. Now we conclude the above discussion
in the following basic theorem.
Theorem 5. Given an (n − k) × 2n parity-
check matrix H ′ of a binary [2n, n + k, d′]
linear block code C ′ with minimum distance
d′ > 4t∗ + 1 such that the commutative con-
dition
H ′PΛ2nP TH ′T = O. (7)
holds for a certain 2n× 2n permutation ma-
trix P , an [[n, k, d ≥ 2t∗ + 1]] stabilizer code
with a check matrix H = H ′P can be con-
structed.
One reason to introduce a permutation
matrix P in Theorem 5 is to possibly ease the
establishment of a check matrix which has to
satisfy the commutative condition in (7). In
Subsection 3.5.4, we will show that it is pos-
sible for a permutation matrix P to increase
(the lower bound of) the minimum distance
of a constructed stabilizer code by half.
3.5.2 Additional Correctable Error Op-
erators
A t∗-error-correcting quantum stabilizer code
of length n has
∑t∗
i=0
(
n
i
)
3i error syndromes.
One may expect that a quantum stabilizer
code constructed by the method of syndrome
assignment in above can correct more than
just those error operators of weight 6 t∗ with
t∗ determined from d′ in Theorem 5. In fact,
any error operator E = ic
′
XaZb with w(a) +
w(b) 6 2t∗ has its own unique syndrome and
hence can be corrected. For example, error
operators Xa and Za with w(a) = 2t
∗ are
correctable.
Let E = icM1⊗M2⊗· · ·⊗Mn = ic′XaZb,
a = (a1, · · · , an), b = (b1, · · · , bn) ∈ Zn2 , be a
correctable error operator with w(a)+w(b) 6
2t∗. Let l = gw(a, b) be the weight of E so
that 0 6 l 6 2t∗. Let mY = w(ab) be the
number of Mj which are equal to Y . Then
mX,Z , l −mY represents the number of Mj
which are equal to X or Z. Since w(a) +
w(b) = 2mY +mX,Z = mY + l, we have mY +
l 6 2t∗ (note that l = mX,Z + mY ). There
are 4

tors for a certain l and a certainmY satisfying

l from t∗ + 1 to 2t∗ and summing mY from 0
to 2t∗ − l, we have additional

which can be a large amount! Figure 1 il-
lustrates the mX,Z-mY region containing ad-
ditional correctable error operators of weight

On the other hand, for a given stabilizer
group S with quantum error-correcting capa-
bility t, the classical minimum distance d′ of
a check matrix of S can be used to deter-
mine the existence of additional correctable
error operators of weight > t and how many

columns of the check matrix H, then
fS(E

(a, b) 6= (u, v). The remaining case is that
(9) is a linear combination of no less than
4t∗ −m columns of the check matrix H. Let
IX , IY and IZ be the sets of indices i such
that ai = 1, bi = 0, ai = 1 = bi, and
ai = 0, bi = 1 respectively. Similarly let
JX , JY and JZ be the sets of indices j such
that uj = 1, vj = 0, uj = 1 = vj, and
uj = 0, vj = 1 respectively. Then (9)
becomes to

where I ′Y = IY \JY , J ′Y = JY \IY ,
I ′X = IX\JX , J ′X = JX\IX , I ′Z = IZ\JZ ,
J ′Z = JZ\IZ . Since
gw(a, b) = |IX |+ |IY |+ |IZ | ≤ t∗,
gw(u, v) = |JX |+ |JY |+ |JZ | ≤ t∗,
|I ′X |+ |I ′Y |+ |I ′Z |+ |J ′X |+ |J ′Y |+ |J ′Z |
≤|IX |+ |IY |+ |IZ |+ |JX |+ |JY |+ |JZ | ≤ 2t∗.
(12)
And since (10) is a linear combination of no
less than 4t∗ −m columns of the check
matrix H,
|IX |+2|IY |+|IZ |+|JX |+2|JY |+|JZ | ≥ 4t∗−m.
(13)
By (12) and (13), we have

we replace the sum fS(Xi) + fS(Zi) by

where r = n − k is the rank of the check

generators. This method will be called the
circulant construction and quantum codes gen-
erated by this method will be called quantum
circulant codes. Circulant construction and
quantum circulant codes will be investigated
in Section 3.8.
Construction III: (|u|u + v| construction)
Suppose that k1 + k2 > n and H1H
T
2 = 0, i.e.
the classical dual code of C2 is a subcode of C1
(and vice versa). Then H =
[
H1 H1
O H2
]
is a
parity-check matrix of a [2n, k1+k2, d
′ > d∗ =
min{d1, d2}] classical binary linear block code
with a generator matrixG =
[
G2 G2
G1 O
]
and
satisfies the commutative conditionHΛ2nH
T =
0 in Theorem 5 with P = I. Thus H is a
check matrix of a stabilizer group S. Since
HX =
[
H1
O
]
, HZ =
[
H1
H2
]
and HY =
HX+HZ =
[
O
H2
]
, we can replace any num-
ber of columns of HY with the corresponding
columns of either HX or HZ so that the re-
sulting matrix H ′Y is a parity-check matrix
of a classical binary linear block code with
minimum distance > 2t∗ + 1, where t∗ =
b(d∗ − 1)/2c. By Theorem 7 with m = 2t∗
and d′ > d∗ > 4t∗ − m = 2t∗, C(S) is an
[[n, k1 + k2 − n, d ≥ 2t∗ + 1]] stabilizer code.
This can also be seen by noting that the sym-
pletic dual code S¯⊥∗ of S¯ has a generator ma-
trix GΛ2n =
[
G2 G2
O G1
]
and the minimum
distance d of C(S) is the minimum general-
ized weight of a nonzero codeword in S¯⊥∗ \ S¯
so that d ≥ d∗ ≥ 2t∗ + 1.
Construction IV: (|u|u + v| construction
with permutation) Suppose that k1 + k2 > n
and there is an n× n permutation matrix Q
such that H1(Q+Q
T )HT1 = 0 and H2QH
T
1 =
O. ThenH =
[
H1 H1
O H2
] [
In O
O Q
]
=
[
H1 H1Q
O H2Q
]
is a parity-check matrix of a [2n, k1 + k2, d
′ >
d∗ = min{d1, d2}] classical binary linear block
code with a generator matrixG =
[
G2 G2
G1 O
]
[
In O
O Q
]
=
[
G2 G2Q
G1 O
]
and satisfies the
commutative condition HΛ2nH
T = 0 in The-
orem 5 with H ′ =
[
H1 H1
O H2
]
and P =[
In O
O Q
]
. Thus H is a check matrix of a
stabilizer group S. Similar to the |u|u + v|
construction (without permutation), by ap-
plying Theorem 7 with t∗ = b(d∗ − 1)/2c,
m = 2t∗ and d′ > d∗ > 4t∗ −m = 2t∗, C(S)
is an [[n, k1 + k2 − n, d ≥ 2t∗ + 1]] stabilizer
code. This can also be seen by noting that the
simplectic dual code S¯⊥∗ of S¯ has a genera-
tor matrix GΛ2n =
[
G2Q G2
O G1
]
. Consider
a nonzero codeword in S¯⊥∗,
(c1, c2) = (u1, u2)
(
G2Q|G2
O |G1
)
= (u1G2Q, u1G2 + u2G1),
with a k1-tuple u1 and a k2-tuple u2, not both
zeros. If u1 6= 0, then gw((c1, c2)) ≥ d2. And
if u1 = 0 and u2 6= 0, then gw((c1, c2)) ≥ d1.
Thus the minimum distance d of C(S) is d >
d∗ = min{d1, d2} > 2t∗ + 1.
Moreover, the introduction of a permuta-
tion matrix P =
[
In O
O Q
]
to the |u|u + v|
construction may improve (the lower bound
of) the minimum distance of the constructed
stabilizer code C(S) as illustrated in the fol-
lowing theorem.
Theorem 8. In the |u|u + v| construction
with permutation, where k1 + k2 > n and
Q is an n × n permutation matrix such that
H1(Q + Q
T )HT1 = O and H2QH
T
1 = O, as-
21
through Theorem 5. However, it becomes ex-
tremely harder to verify this suggestion for
n ≥ 8 due to prohibitive computing complex-
ity. (16! ' 2× 1013, which is about 106 times
the case n = 5.) The question of determin-
ing a permutation matrix P for a parity-check
matrixH so thatHP is commutative remains
open. The construction of quantum stabilizer
codes can be converted to the construction
of classical binary linear block codes of even
length which have rate > 1/2 and a commu-
tative parity-check matrix.
3.6.1 Asymptotic Coding Efficiency
In this subsection, we will investigate the asymp-
totic coding efficiency of the construction of
stabilizer codes as stated in Theorem 5 by as-
suming that for any n, k, d′ considered, there
is at least one code with a commutative parity-
check matrix among all classical [2n, n+k, d′]
binary linear block codes.
Now an [[n, k, d ≥ d∗ = 2t∗ + 1]] stabilizer
code is constructed by Theorem 5 from an
[n′ = 2n, k′ = k+ n, d′ ≥ 4t∗ + 1] classical bi-
nary linear block code, where t∗ = bd′−1

α = 2α′ − 1. (21)

and δ∗− 1

. Thus for sufficiently large n, we have
δ∗ ' δ′. (22)
It is obvious that δ ≥ δ∗ = δ′. From [45], the
classical Hamming bound says that α′(δ′) ≤
1−H2(12δ′), where H2(x) = −x log2(x)− (1−
x) log2(1 − x). By (21) and (22), we have a
corresponding quantum Hamming bound of
the code construction in Theorem 5, which is
α(δ∗) ≤ 1− 2H2(1

δ∗). (23)
The classical Plotkin Bound says that
α′(δ′) ≤ 1− 2δ′, if 0 ≤ δ′ ≤ 1

α′(δ′) = 0, if 1

and by (21) and (22), the corresponding quan-

in Theorem 5 is
α(δ∗) ≤ 1− 4δ∗, if 0 ≤ δ∗ ≤ 1

α(δ∗) = 0, if 1

The classical Elias Bound says that

α′(δ′) = 0, if 1

and by (21) and (22), the corresponding quan-

α(δ∗) ≤ 1− 2H2(12 −

that α′(δ′) ≤ H2(12−

and (22), the corresponding weaker quantum

3.7.1 Properties of Classical Reed-Muller
Codes
Classical Reed-Muller codes are weakly self-
dual codes and have simple but good struc-
tural properties [44]. A Reed-Muller code has
two parameters r,m, 0 ≤ r ≤ m, and is de-
noted by RM(r,m). This code is of length
2m and r is called its order. Consider the
following (m+ 1) 2m-tuples:
1 = ( 1111 · · · 1111 1111 · · · 1111 ),
v1 = ( 0101 · · · 0101 0101 · · · 0101 ),
v2 = ( 0011 · · · 0011 0011 · · · 0011 ),
...
...
. . .
...
...
. . .
...
vm = ( 0000 · · · 0000 1111 · · · 1111 ).
Then RM(r,m) is generated by
(degree 0) 1,
(degree 1) v1, · · · , vm,
(degree 2) v1v2, · · · , vm−1vm,
...
(degree r) v1v2 · · · vr, · · · , vm−r+1vm−r+2 · · · vm,
where the product of the vi’s means the bit-
wise AND of the vi’s and the degree means
the number of vi’s appearing in the prod-
uct. There are several properties ofRM(r,m)
which can be derived directly from its con-
struction [44]. The dimension of RM(r,m)
is k =
∑r
i=0
(
m
i
)
and the minimum distance
of RM(r,m) is d = 2m−r. The dual code of
RM(r,m) is RM(m−r−1,m) for 0 ≤ r ≤ m,
where RM(−1,m) , {0}. Let G(r,m) de-
note a generator matrix of RM(r,m). Reed-
Muller code RM(r,m + 1) can be obtained
from RM(r,m) and RM(r − 1,m) by using
the |u|u+v| construction. A generator matrix
of RM(r,m+ 1) is
G(r,m+1) =
(
G(r,m) G(r,m)
O G(r−1,m)
)
. (33)

of the [[2m, 2m − 2∑r−1i=0 (mi ), 2r]] CSS code,
the former code has a surplus
(
m

)
in dimen-
sion, while the minimum distance of the for-
mer code is only half of that of the latter CSS
code. However, the former code has a lot of
additional correctable error operators which
will strengthen the error performance of the
former code.
3.7.3 Permutations Which Increase the
Minimum Distance
We find that if we multiply G(1,m+1) by the
permutation matrix P =
(
I O
O Q
)
with Q
being the permutation matrix used in [38], a
stabilizer group S with a check matrix H =
G(1,m+1)P will give a quantum stabilizer code
C(S) with the same parameters [[2m, 2m −
m − 2, 3]] as those of the code constructed
in [38], while the code by our construction
has a larger set of correctable error operators.
For example, when m = 3,
Q =

0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0

0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

.
There are many other permutation matri-
ces that will work by Theorem 10 in [43],
which means that a column permutation on a
parity-check matrix may give a stabilizer code
C(S) with higher quantum error-correcting
capability.
We first investigate the effect of permu-
tation matrices on G(r,m+1) with 1 ≤ r and
2r < m.
Theorem 13. Let P =
(
I O
O Q
)
, where Q is
a permutation matrix such that all the condi-
tions in Theorem 8 hold with C1 = RM(m−
r− 1,m), C2 = RM(m− r,m) and d1 = 2r+1,
d2 = 2
r. Then for 1 ≤ r and 2r < m, the
quantum stabilizer code C(S) with a check
matrix H = G(r,m+1)P will have parameters
[[2m, 2m−∑ri=0 (m+1i ), d ≥ 2r + 2r−1]]. In ad-
dition, C(S) will have additional correctable
error operators when r ≥ 3.
Proof. By Theorem 8, the minimum
distance d of C(S) is at least
min{d1, d3d22 e} = 2r + 2r−1. Since the
classical minimum distance of the
parity-check matrix H = G(r,m+1)P remains
unchanged after a column permutation, the
lower bound of the quantum error correcting
capability for C(S) predicted by Theorem 5
is t∗ = 2r−1 − 1, the same as that for
QRM(r,m). With d ≥ 2r + 2r−1, the
error-correcting capability of the quantum
code C(S) is t ≥ t˜ = bd−1
2
c with
t˜ = 3 · 2r−2 − 1 if r ≥ 2 and t˜ = 1 if r = 1.
Then we have 2t∗ − t˜ = 2r−2 − 1 > 0 if
r ≥ 3. Thus by Proposition 6 with t˜
substituting t, the quantum code C(S) will
have additional correctable error operators
of weight > t˜ = 3 · 2r−2 − 1 if r ≥ 3. 2
In [47], Steane gave a class of quantum
Reed-Muller codes with parameters [[2m, 2m−∑r
i=0
(
m+1
i
)
, d ≥ 2r + 2r−1]]. If there exists a
permutation matrix P satisfying the assump-
tions in Theorem 13, a stabilizer group S with
a check matrix H = G(r,m+1)P , r ≥ 1, will

...
w2Q = v2v4 · · · vm−1vmvm + v2v4 · · · vmv1
= v2v4 · · · vm + w3,
w1Q = v3v4 · · · vm−1vmvm + v3v4 · · · vmv1
= v3v4 · · · vm + w2.
If uG3Q+ uG3 ∈ C1 for some binary
m−tuple u = (a1, · · · , am), then
m∑
i=1
aiwi+
m∑
i=1
aiwiQ ∈ RM(m− 2,m), (35)
which implies that all the coefficients of the
terms of degree m− 1 in (35) must be zero,
i.e.,
a1 + a2 = a2 + a3 = · · · = am−1 + am
=a1 + am−1 + am = 0
and then ai = 0 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ m. Therefore,
we have uG3Q+ uG3 6∈ C1 for any nonzero
(k2 − k1)-tuple u so that (20) is verified. 2
There are permutation matrices, other than
TS, which will work by similar proofs. How-
ever, the search for an effective permutation
for a general RM(r,m) with 2 ≤ r and 2r <
m is still an open problem.
3.8 Quantum Circulant Codes
In this section, we investigate the circulant
construction in Subsection 3.5.4 with a check
matrix H = [HX |HZ ] of the following joint
circulant form,
H = [HX |HZ ] = [G1|G2]

where r = n − k is the rank of the check
matrix H and g1 = (a0, a1, . . . , an−1), g2 =
(b0, b1, . . . , bn−1) are two generators.
We find the best [[n, k]] quantum circulant
codes by computer search as follows. Given
two generators g1 = (a0, a1, . . . , an−1) and g2 =
(b0, b1, . . . , bn−1), we justify the rank of the
circulant check matrixH in (36) and the com-
mutativity of H as in (3). Then the minimum
distance of the quantum circulant code with
the justified check matrix H is determined by
computer search.
We list the best [[n, k]] quantum circulant
codes of length 5 ≤ n ≤ 24 in Table 2, where
many are extremal quantum codes with pa-
rameters achieving the upper bounds in Ta-
ble III in [43]. We find new stabilizer codes of
lengths 23 and 24 with parameters [[23, 8, 5]],
[[24, 2, 7]], [[24, 8, 5]] and [[24, 9, 5]] in Table
2. In addition, stabilizer codes of length 25
with parameters [[25, 8, 5]] and [[25, 9, 5]] are
also found. Each of which increases the lower
bound of the highest achievable minimum dis-
tance in Table III in [43]. Note that these
parameters can also be found in the table
of [55]. The two circulant generators for each
of the six stabilizer codes with parameters
[[23, 8, 5]], [[24, 2, 7]], [[24, 8, 5]], [[24, 9, 5]], [[25, 8, 5]]
and [[25, 9, 5]] are listed in Table 3. The quan-
tum cyclic codes that have comparable pa-
rameters are quantum BCH codes [53]. We
find that for n = 21 our parameters [[21, 3, 6]],
[[21, 9, 4]], [[21, 15, 3]] are better than the pa-
rameters [[21, 3, 5]], [[21, 9, 3]], [[21, 15, 2]] of quan-
tum BCH codes and for n = 5, 7, 13, 15, 17, 23,
the parameters are the same.
When considered as classical parity-check
matrices, the check matrices of these best quan-
tum circulant codes are observed to have clas-
sical minimum distances exactly the same as
their corresponding quantum minimum dis-
tances. Indeed, Theorem 7 is well applicable
to the check matrices of these best quantum
circulant codes. For example, the [[5, 1, 3]]

by αi and βi, respectively. Since αi and βi
are the i-th right cyclic shifts of the
indicator vectors of all non-zero elements
and all non-residues in GF (q) respectively,
the inner product αi · βi of αi and βi is equal
to the sum of |N | 1’s modulo 2, where |N | is
the size of the non-residue set N . When
p ≡ 1 mod 4, |N | is an even number so that
αi · βi = 0 for all 0 ≤ i ≤ p− 1. Note that
αi + αj = 0 · · · 010 · · · 010 · · · 0 with two 1’s
at the i-th and the j-th positions when
i 6= j. The matrix [H ′Y |H ′Z ] is commutative
if and only if αi · βj + αj · βi = 0 for all
0 ≤ i, j ≤ p− 1. Since αi · βi = 0, we have
αi · βi + βi · αi = 0
for all 0 ≤ i ≤ p− 1. And for i 6= j,
0 ≤ i, j ≤ p− 1,
αi · βj + αj · βi
=(αi + αj) · (βi + βj)
=(0 · · · 010 · · · 010 · · · 0) · (βi + βj)
=(HZ)i,i + (HZ)j,i + (HZ)i,j + (HZ)j,j
=0,
since H ′Z is symmetric by Lemma 17 and
(H ′Z)i,i = b0 = 0 for all i. This proves that
[H ′Y |H ′Z ] is commutative and then [H ′X |H ′Z ]
is commutative too. Since [H ′Y |H ′Z ] can be
obtained from [H ′X |H ′Z ] by elementary
column operations, the rank of [H ′X |H ′Z ] is
the same as that of [H ′Y |H ′Z ]. We note that
the sum of any even number of rows of H ′Y
is a non-zero vector since the component of
the sum is non-zero in a position at which a
zero component appears in any of its
summands. And except the sum of all rows
of H ′Y , which is the zero vector, the sum of
any odd number of rows of H ′Y is also a
non-zero vector since the component of the
sum is non-zero in a position at which no
zero component appears in any of its
summands. Thus the rank of H ′Y is p− 1,
which implies that the rank of [H ′Y |H ′Z ] is at
least p− 1. Since |N | is an even number, the
sum of all rows of H ′Z is the zero vector so
that the sum of all rows of the matrix
[H ′Y |H ′Z ] is the zero vector, which implies
that the rank of [H ′Y |H ′Z ] is at most p− 1.
We then conclude that the rank of the
matrix [H ′Y |H ′Z ] is p− 1 so that the rank of
the matrix [H ′X |H ′Z ] is also p− 1. 2
Now from the above theorem, the matrixH =
[HX |HZ ] obtained by removing the last row
of the matrix [H ′X |H ′Z ] becomes to a check
matrix of a [[p, 1, d]] quantum stabilizer code,
where the minimum distance d is to be deter-
mined.
In [39], the quadratic residue related quan-
tum codes with p ≡ 5 mod 8 are special cases
of above theorem. Parameters of several quan-
tum codes constructed from Theorem 18 are
given in Table 4. The minimum distances
of these codes are determined by computer
search. When considered as classical parity-
31
generates a [[17, 1, 7]] quantum stabilizer code
that achieves the upper bound in [43]. A
[[17, 1, 7]] quantum stabilizer code can be con-
structed by quantum BCH codes in [53, 54].
However, the above four vectors are found by
computer search. In general, it is difficult to
determine a well-performed vector g and the
minimum distance of the resulted quantum
code efficiently.
4 Conclusion
In the first year of this project, we have pro-
posed a procedure to construct a POVM mea-
surement for unambiguous quantum state dis-
crimination. By this procedure, we demon-
strated that the necessary and sufficient con-
dition for constructing an unambiguous dis-
crimination POVM is equivalent to the con-
dition for infinite quantum cloning. This con-
dition turns out to be a powerful tool to an-
alyze the optimal efficiencies for minimizing
the inconclusive probability and for the min-
imax criterion. Although the optimum prob-
lem for minimizing the inconclusive probabil-
ity has been approached by SDP in [11], we
have presented an alternative algorithm that
gives the optimum efficiency. In the case of
minimax criterion, we gave the optimum effi-
ciency for EPM by another approach, which
is easier to compute.
We have considered a necessary and suf-
ficient condition for the states under which
the optimum efficiency will satisfy the min-
imum inconclusive probability criterion and
the minimax criterion simultaneously. Fur-
thermore, for any set of linearly independent
states, we can adjust the a priori probabili-
ties to satisfy this condition. For the case of
GU states, we have shown that equal a priori
probabilities meet this condition.
The unambiguous discrimination efficien-
cies for a set of states is totally determined
by its Gram matrix, or equivalent, the inner
products between the states. The conditions
we have considered are for any linearly in-
dependent set of states. The discrimination
efficiencies can be improved by selecting the
states.
In the second-third years of this project,
a simple stabilizer code construction is pro-
posed based on syndrome assignment by clas-
sical parity-check matrices. The construction
of quantum stabilizer codes can then be con-
verted to the construction of classical binary
linear block codes with commutative parity-
check matrices. The asymptotic coding per-
formance of this construction is shown to be
promisingly at least comparable to that of
the CSS construction. Note that only non-
degenerate codes are studied in this paper
since the method of syndrome assignment is
unnatural for degenerate codes.
With the proposed code construction, the
designed minimum distance 2t∗ + 1 of the
constructed quantum stabilizer codes can be
achieved by a commutative classical parity-
check matrix with classical minimum distance
4t∗−m, where the parameterm, 0 ≤ m ≤ 2t∗,
depends on a property of the parity-check ma-
trix. As m decreases, there is an increasing
set of additional correctable error operators
beyond the designed error correcting capabil-
ity t∗. Thus with a commutative parity-check
matrix having m = 2t∗, a designed quantum
minimum distance d ≥ 2t∗+1 can be achieved
by a classical minimum distance d′ ≥ 2t∗.
This is explicitly illustrated in the diagonal
construction and the |u|u + v| construction
with/without permutation as well as the best
quantum circulant codes and quadratic residue
related quantum codes.
Permutation matrices may help transform
non-commutative parity-check matrices to com-
mutative ones and/or increase the minimum
distance of the constructed quantum codes.
However, for a given parity-check matrix H,
it remains open to find an effective permuta-
tion matrix P such that HP is commutative
and/or corresponds to a code with greater
minimum distance.

二、目的 
2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT2010), the 
most important conference in the area of information theory, is hosted 
by Rice University and Texas A&M University on June 13th to 18th, 2010, 
in Austin, Texas. Attending this conference can monitor and collect the 
research trend of this area. One of the host universities, Texas A&M, is 
one hour away, by the car, from the conference location and it is famous 
in the research field of electrical and computer engineering (ECE). This 
university is planned to be visited, guided by one of my ex-colleagues 
who works for his PhD in Texas A&M, to know how the field of ECE is developed 
in the U.S. And since the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin), also 
famous in the field of engineering, is also located in the city of Austin, 
where the ISIT 2010 is hosted in. So the university, particularly the ECE 
department, is also planned to be visited during this trip. And it is worth 
to compare how different universities operate their ECE departments in 
the U.S.

a rising research region that we should keep tracking since many EE or 
ECE departments in America universities have extended their research to 
this part. But I suggest that we may send students who actually work on 
this area to next ISIT if the number of bio-related papers grows in the 
next conference. 
 
For the conventional topics in the information theory, channel capacity 
and error-correction code are still significant in the conference. For 
channel capacity, many efforts are still concentrated on the networks 
channel capacity; for error-correction code, the topics of lattice codes 
become a little more attractive. 
 
For channel capacity, the network capacity, especially on wireless, is 
an important problem for a long time. But in the plenary on 15th June, 
professor Gamal from Stanford University said that even for the 
three-point network, i.e., network with one relay node only, the capacity 
is still unknown. Although it heard some kind of depressive, it means that 
there exists an intrinsic problem that is not solved. After the conference, 
in lab's internal meeting, my teacher suggests me that this is because 
some mathematical tool for this problem such as calculus of variation is 
still under construction. The problem again highlights the importance of 
fundamental mathematical tools and the students in the engineering field 
should pay additional attention on (though their jobs is already a lot 
in the engineering field). 
 
On the other hand, the topic of lattice codes, codes over real field but 
not over finite field, becomes a little more attractive since the 
researchers in the information society start to build and strengthen an 
area called modern coding theory. But I think that to follow up the topic 
of lattice codes, fundamentals of coding theory, signal processing, and 
optimization theory are well needed. In this aspect, to enter this field, 
the cooperation between labs can bring significant progress in the initial 
phase.

expected to have good performance in the design of MIMO codes. If the 
topic has progress continually, we will start to investigate the topic. 
 
2. Title: Heavy Weight Codes 
Author: G. Cohen, P. Sole', and A. Tchamkerten 
This research investigates the codes that can be used in the scenarios 
combining the synchronization and error-correction at the same time. 
This kind of scenarios is considered to be important in some power 
constraint networks or some applications that the information passing 
is urgent. Although this kind of codes may not be considered important 
in the general cases, but this paper catches a suitable aspect of 
applications and shows well result. We do research sometimes need to 
increase this kind of view in different aspects. 
 
 
In this conference, I met other students from Taiwan including Nation 
Taiwan University and National Chiao-Tung University and also met my two 
ex-colleagues in ITRI (工研院) who now are PhD students in the U.S. It 
is a good opportunity to know each other so I did the introduction for 
all of them and then we shared our opinions on the regions of information 
theory and coding theory. It seems that many researchers in the U.S. now 
try to construct codes using much statistical techniques and in this way 
they call it modern coding theory. I think we can invite more speakers 
to Taiwan to talk about this topic.  
 
My two ex-colleagues in ITRI (工研院): 
    
They are now working for their PhD degrees in Texas A&M and University 
of Wisconsin-Madison respectively. They share me a lot of observations 
and information about the research trends in the U.S.

The ECE department of Texas A&M and its Wisenbaker Engineering Research 
Center: 
    
    
  There, I saw how they organize their resources of the College of 
Engineering such that each student can easily access as more resources 
as they can. 
 
    
They make very well posters to show their research results. 
    
     My friend showed me some of his work.  There is an IEEE branch in 
the department.
