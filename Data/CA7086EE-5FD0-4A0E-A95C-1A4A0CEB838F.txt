SUMMARY   This investigation proposed a novel 
dual-mode circular patch bandpass filter (BPF) with 
enhanced stopband performance. The novelty of the 
proposed structure is to use a pair of square etched 
areas acting as a perturbation element on the circular 
patch resonator such that two split modes are coupled 
and the filter structure can be reduced. The coupling 
coefficients of two split modes are obtained. To 
improve the stopband performance, a pairs of H-shaped 
defected ground structure (DGS) cells are used below 
the input/output port to suppress the spurious response 
of the proposed BPF. The equivalent circuit of the DGS 
cell is discussed and the relations between bandstop 
characteristic and the suitable DGS dimensions are also 
investigated. The proposed BPF is demonstrated with a 
central frequency fo = 2.2 GHz, a 3-dB bandwidth of 8 
% and a wider stopband of –35 dB from 2.5 to 6 GHz. 
Measured results of experimental filter have good 
agreement with the theoretical simulaed results.

1. Introduction 
Compact planar microwave filters by uses of 
dual-mode resonators are attractive and have been 
studied for recent years since their excellent 
performances of narrow bandwidth, two transmission 
zeros, size reduction and high-selectivity [1-5]. The 
dual-mode bandpass filters (BPFs) mainly consist of a 
physical coupling of two degenerate modes excited by a 
perturbation element. The perturbation element is 
located along the orthogonal plane of resonator in a 
symmetrical structure such as ring or patch resonator. 
In [3], it was reported that a square microstrip resonator 
could exhibit filter characteristics by etching periodic 
structures on the ground plane underneath with some 
defects. And, a compact dual mode BPF is also 
designed by offsetting the circular holes along the 
diagonal axis of symmetry [5]. However, the 
dual-mode filters inherently have a spurious response in 
the out-of-band as shown in [3-5]. While, the 
requirements of the high performance filter in the 
sensitive receiver needs a wider upper stopband for 
reducing the interference from out of-band signals, and 
therefore a cascaded lowpass filter or bandstop filter 
may be used to suppress the spurious response at cost 
of extra insertion loss and size. The photonic bandgap 
(PBG) structures with periodic arrays of etched on the 
ground plane have been investigated for microstrip 
circuits to provide the rejection in some frequency band 
[6-7]. However, since it is difficult to find equivalent 
circuits of PBG structures and then extract all the 
circuit parameters, PBG structures are difficult to 
design in microwave or millimeter-wave components. 
The defect ground structure (DGS) is also realized by 
etching off a defected pattern from the ground plane 
[8-10]. These new structures of periodic or 
non-periodic structures also provide a wide rejection 
band in some frequency range. Kim et al. proposed that 
DGS sections with the H shape can be performed as a 
parallel LC resonator and used the DGS sections as the 
2.2 GHz. Therefore, structural miniaturization resulting 
in about 17 % savings of filter size is obtained. 
 
(b) Coupling coefficient 
The perturbation element of two square etched areas 
works like a mode splitter to produce a coupling 
between the two degenerate (orthogonal) split modes 
existing in the circular patch resonator. In general, the 
coupling strength of the two split modes depends on the 
physical geometry of the perturbation element, 
significantly distorted the current density distribution 
on the patch surface. Figure 3 shows simulated two 
split mode frequencies, characteristics of two split 
mode frequencies and coupling coefficient for different 
relative offset distance. Two split mode frequencies of 
2.1GHz and 2.4GHz are observed as relative offset 
distance r=9 mm, as shown in Fig. 3(a). Two split 
modes of 2.1GHz and 2.4GHz are observed, 
respectively. To quantify this coupling between the two 
split modes, the response of various relative offset 
distance from the center of the circular patch resonator 
to the center of the square areas are simulated. The two 
resonant frequencies of EM-simulated split mode are 
then used for computation of coupling coefficient [12]. 
Characteristics of two split mode frequencies and 
coupling coefficient for different relative offset distance 
are shown in Fig. 3 (b) and (c) shows. The coupling 
coefficient linearly drops off as the distance r increases.  
 
( c) Design of Dual-Mode Circular Patch BPF 
A circular patch resonator of resonance frequency 
2.4 GHz is originally chosen and the etched areas will 
cause a 8 % reduction in the resonant frequency and a 
17% savings of filter size. Therefore, the proposed BPF 
is then designed at 2.2 GHz on the FR-4 substrate with 
a coupling coefficient of 0.02 ( relative offset distance 
r=6.8 mm) and bandwidth of 8%. Weak coupling is 
designed in the case of proposed dual-mode BPF to 
have narrowband operation. Figure 4 shows simulated 
frequency response of the dual-mode circular patch 
BPF on FR 4 substrate with the dielectric constant εr = 
4.4 and thickness h = 0.8 mm. The design parameters of 
dual-mode circular patch BPF are patch radius R=17.3 
mm, i = j = 7 mm and r=6.8mm. From the simulated 
result, the designed BPF has a central frequency of 2.2 
GHz, a 3-dB fractional bandwidth of 8 %, a lower 
transmission zero of 1.8 GHz and an upper 
transmission zero of 2.5 GHz. The simulated results 
confirm the usefulness of the new structure of a pairs of 
square etched areas as the perturbation elements. 
However, the spurious response is also located at 3.8 
GHz, as the same as the design in [3,5], since the higher 
order modes may be excited in the typical dual-mode 
ring or patch filters.  
Figure 5 shows simulated two-dimensional profile of 
current distributions over the whole conductor surface 
for proposed dual-mode circular patch BPF at 2.2 GHz 
and at 3.8 GHz. It is easily figured out that the current 
distribution around the circular patch resonator at 2.2 
GHz is almost identical with respect to the symmetry 
plane, and the level of the current density along the 
input and output ports are also close to each other, as 
shown in Fig. 5(a). This result suggests that the dual 
split modes are excited with a nearly identical level and 
the incident wave from the input port can be effectively 
transmitted onto the output port so that a two-pole 
filtering characteristic is well realized [13]. In addition, 
there will be no visible port-to-port signal loss since the 
current densities around the input and output ports are 
approximately the same at resonance [2]. Observing the 
current distribution at spurious response of 3.8 GHz, as 
shown in Fig. 5(b), the current is also spread over the 
whole patch in certain level and higher order modes are 
excited to form the spurious response. However, for 
requirements of the high performance filter, a wider 
upper stopband for reducing the interference from 
out-of-band signals is required. To improve the 
stopband of proposed BPF, DGS will be used and 
designed into the BPF later. 
 
3. Improved Stopband of proposed BPF using DGS 
(a) Analysis of Defected Ground Structure Element 
The DGS etched off a defect pattern from the ground 
plane displays a rejection band in a certain frequency 
range, acting as a parallel LC resonator [8]. Figure 6 
shows analysis of an H-shaped DGS cell below a 50 Ω 
 (b) Relations between Spurious Suppression and gap 
position of DGS cell 
In Fig. 5(b), the current distribution of proposed 
dual-mode patch BPF without DGS at 3.8 GHz are 
concentrated in the input and output port, and this 
phenomenon will give us some ideas to design the 
position of the DGS cell [14]. Figure 10 shows 
geometrical view of the proposed dual-mode circular 
patch BPF with DGS under-near the I/O ports, which 
the dark area is metallic area.  
From above discussion, the bandstop characteristic 
of the H shaped DGS cell is expressed by the LC 
resonance, which the equivalent inductor depends on 
the dimension a and b and the capacitance depends on 
the gap f. Although the dimension a and b and the gap f 
are fixed, the attenuation pole frequency of the H 
shaped DGS cell is determined. However, in tables I 
and II, it is found that as the equivalent inductance 
varies, the variations of the cutoff frequency are much 
larger than those of the attenuation pole frequency. 
Therefore, the relative position of the gap will slightly 
effect the rejection range even the attenuation pole 
frequency of the H shaped DGS cell is determined as 
the dimension a and b and the gap f are fixed. The 
relations between the spurious suppression and the 
parameters c and d of H-shaped DGS are discussed and 
optimized. Figure 11 shows simulated frequency 
responses of the dual-mode circular patch BPF with 
different DGS parameters c and d. The other design 
parameters of the dual-mode circular patch BPF with 
DGS cells are a = 11 mm, b = 3.8 mm, e = 1 mm, f = 
0.2 mm, R = 17.35 mm, i = j = 7 mm, r=6.8 mm. For c 
= 0 mm and d = 10.8 mm, the spurious response of the 
proposed filter is not well suppressed due to different 
rejection range produced by H-shaped DGS cells. The 
shiftiness of stopband is caused by a lager equivalent 
capacitance for c = 0 mm and d = 10.8 mm, resulting in 
a lower stopband. The parameters of c = 9.4 mm and d 
= 1.4 mm are optimized to suppress the spurious 
response by the EM simulator. Consequently, the 
stopband produced by H-shaped DGS cell can be also 
adjusted by the parameters of c and d without changing 
the central frequency of the proposed BPF. 
 
(b) Spurious Suppression using DGS cell 
Figure 12 shows simulated frequency responses of 
the dual-mode circular patch BPF with and without 
DGS cells on FR 4 substrate with dielectric constant εr 
= 4.4 and thickness h = 0.8 mm. The design parameters 
of the novel dual-mode circular patch BPF with DGS 
are a = 11 mm, b = 3.8 mm, c = 9.5 mm, d = 1.3 mm, e 
= 1 mm, f = 0.2 mm, R = 17.35 mm, i = j = 7 mm, 
r=6.8 mm, which is chosen from the above discussion 
and optimized by the EM simulator IE3D for more 
rejection. It can be seen that employing the proposed 
DGS cells can succeed to suppress the spurious 
response of 3.8GHz from -2 dB to -55 dB, and the 
fundamental passband performance having lower and 
upper transmission zeros is remain unmoved.  
To understand the suppressing mechanism of the 
spurious response, the current distributions of the 
proposed BPF with DGS are observed. Figure 13 shows 
simulated two-dimensional profile of current 
distributions over the whole conductor surface for 
proposed dual-mode circular patch BPF with DGS cells 
at 2.2 GHz and 3.8 GHz, respectively. The design 
parameters are the same as those of Fig. 12. The current 
distribution of proposed BPF with DGS cells at 2.2 
GHz is almost the same to that without DGS cells in 
Fig. 7 (a), because the bandstop frequency of the DGS 
cell is designed at 3.8 GHz. However, the current is 
bounded in the input and output feed lines and 
forbidden to distribute into the patch resonator, as 
comparing to Fig. 7(b) with Fig. 13(b). Since no current 
distribution appears near the two square etched areas, 
no mode can be excited and then the spurious response 
of the dual mode patch resonator can be suppressed by 
using proposed DGS cells at the I/O ports. 
 
4. Experiments and Measured Results 
From the above discussion, the proposed BPF sample 
is then fabricated and measured. Standard SMA 
Connectors connected to the I/O ports are used for 
measurement by an Agilent 8753E Network Analyzer.
