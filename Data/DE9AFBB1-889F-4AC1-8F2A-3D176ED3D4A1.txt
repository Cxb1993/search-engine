Abstract
The effects of deposition temperature and pressure on the properties of MgTiO3 the films
were investigated. MgTiO3 thin films were grown on Si(100) substrate by radio frequency (RF)
magnetron sputtering. The microstructure and the surface morphology of MgTiO3 thin film have
been studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The XRD showed
that the deposited films exhibited a polycrystalline microstructure. The grain size of the film
increased with an increase in the substrate temperature. The electrical properties were measured
using C–V and current-voltage (I–V) measurements on metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS)
capacitor structures. At a Ar/O2 ratio of 100/0, RF power of 400 W and substrate temperature of
350oC, the MgTiO3 films with 5.62 um thickness possess a dielectric constant of 15.91 (f =10
MHz), a leakage current density of 9.1x10-10 A/mm2 was obtained at 500 kV/cm. The leakage
current decreased with decrease chamber pressure and substrate temperature.
1. Introduction
In recent years, thin films such BaTiO3[1-2], SrTiO3, (Ba,Sr)TiO3, Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 and
(Ba,Pb)(Zr,Ti)O3 with a high relative dielectric constant have been considered for use as storage
capacitors in dynamic random access memories (DRAMs), such a dielectric material should have
a low leakage current and a high dielectric constant, and it is desirable that it has a paraelectric
phase to avoid fatigue due to ferroelectric domain switching. Until very recently, a significant,
global research and development effort has been implemented to identify and qualify suitable
high-k dielectric materials. In complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology, using
high-k materials is a formidable task to achieve further gains in productivity and performance for
device scaling due to direct tunneling currents and boron penetration in SiO2 below ~1.5 nm.
Similar problems are anticipated with the dynamic random access memory storage capacitor
dielectrics. For the next generation of ultra-large scale integrated Dynamic Random Access
Memory (DRAM), it is widely believed that dielectric materials with high dielectric constant
such as SrTiO3, Ta2O5, and (Ba,Sr)TiO3 will be needed for storage capacitors. The use of such
thin films that are fabricated with high dielectric constant materials makes it possible to reduce
the size of storage capacitors, and to simplify the memory cell structure for higher integration
density. These prepared thin films are also capable in reducing the dimension of a device in
communication integration density. Besides, thin-film technology has become a major
requirement for integration since integrated circuits have been applied in microwave
communication system, such as mobile phones, global positioning systems(GPS), and satellite
communications, the demand for monolithic microwave integrated circuit technologies(MMIC)
has been increasing [3,4]. For miniaturization of integrated circuitry, microwave dielectric
components need improved characteristics, smaller size, and compatibility with existing circuits.
MgTiO3 thin Film deposition was prepared using RF magnetron sputtering, as previously
described. The target was cleaned by sintering with RF power of 50 W for 15 min with pure Ar
atmosphere, at the same time the substrate was covered with the shield. The following sputter
conditions were used in this work: chamber pressure of 2 mTorr ~ 8 mTorr which was maintained
by a argon, different substrate temperature (150oC ~ 350oC) and sputtering time for 3 h then the
deposited films were annealed at 400oC for 2 h.
The film structure was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/Max Ⅲ.Ⅴ) at 30 kV
and 20 mA with Cu Kα radiation. The thin film grown on n-type Si(100) substrates was analyzed
by Ultrahigh Resolution Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM, Hitachi S4100). The morphology
of the film surface was determined using an atomic force microscope (AFM, Digital Instrument
DI3000) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The thickness of the MgTiO3 films were
measured with an alpha step ( Tencoα-step 500 ).
The electrical characteristics were evaluated by capacitance-voltage (C–V) and
current-voltage (I–V) measurements on metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) capacitor structures.
The sample structures were fabricated by symmetrically depositing Al electrodes on MgTiO3 film
and on the other side of a Si wafer. The C-V and I-V characteristics of the MIS capacitors were
obtain by using an HP4192 impedance Analyzer and HP4156 Parameter Analyzer.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Crystal structure of films
Figure 1 shows the XRD pattern of MgTiO3 films deposited at different chamber pressure
with substrate temperatures of 350oC, sputtering time of 3 h, Ar/O2 ratio of 100/0 for 3 h. It
reveals that the MgTiO3 films were polycrystalline was obtained at chamber pressure from 2 m to
8 mTorr. The intensity of the peaks decreased with increasing chamber pressure. It may be
assumed that these results are due to a decrease of crystallinity which resulted from a drop in the
kinetic energy of the sputtered atoms due to a shorter mean free path and the consequent
reduction of surface mobility of the atoms on the substrate surface with increasing chamber
pressure. As the chamber pressure was decreased, the intensities of MgTiO3 films (110), (202),
(116) and (018) peaks were enhanced. The intensities of (110) and (202) peaks were relatively
higher than those of other peaks of MgTiO3 films, indicating that highly (110)-oriented MgTiO3
films were obtained on n-type Si(100) substrates.
Figure 2 shows the surface microstructures of the MgTiO3 films deposited at n-type Si(100)
substrates with different chamber pressure. SEM observations reveal that the films deposited at
low pressure exhibit a dense microstructure with any apparent porosity (as shown in Fig. 2 (a)).
As chamber pressure increased to 8 mTorr , not only the films become more and more porous but
also their features significantly increase in size. At 8 mTorr, the films have a highly porous
structure and are composed of very large features (as shown in Fig. 2(c)). These results shown
that denser films can be obtained at low gas pressure due to a shorter mean free path and the
consequent reduction of surface mobility of the atoms on the substrate surface with increasing
chamber pressure. The SEM indicated the gain size increase with increasing chamber pressure.
Dense and uniform grain growth ceramic films were obtained at chamber pressure of 2 mTorr.
Figure 3 shows the XRD pattern of the target material and MgTiO3 films deposited at
different substrate temperatures (150oC~350oC) with a sputtering time of 3 h, Ar/O2 ratio of 100/0,
RF power of 400 W, sputtering pressure of 2 mTorr and annealed at 400 oC for 2 h. It indicates
increased, the dielectric constant decreases. The dielectric constant of the film at 10 MHz is
15.85 which is similar to the bulk ceramic [12].
4. Conclusions
Crystalline MgTiO3 thin films grown on n-type Si(100) substrate by RF magnetron
sputtering at various chamber pressure (2-8 mTorr) and substrate temperatures (150oC-350oC)
were investigated. The quality of MgTiO3 films was found to strongly depend on substrate
temperature and chamber pressure. As the chamber pressure decreased and substrate temperature
increased, the crystallinity of the MgTiO3 thin films improved. In addition, the surface
roughnesses of the thin films decreased with increasing substrate temperature were observed by
AFM. The optimum conditions for the growth of MgTiO3 thin films in this study were a substrate
temperature of 400oC and RF power of 400 W. The MIS structure was introduced in the
measurement of C–V and I–V curves for the MgTiO3 thin films. A high dielectric constant of 16.2
(f = 10 MHz) and a low dissipation factor of 0.04 were obtained for the prepared films. All the
characteristics of the prepared MgTiO3 thin film suggest the suitability of them for microwave
and integrated circuit application.
