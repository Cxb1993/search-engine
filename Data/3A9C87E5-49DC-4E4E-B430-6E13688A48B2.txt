between the transmitter and receiver local oscillators. Similar to a single-input
single-output (SISO) OFDM system, a multi-antenna OFDM system is very sensitive
to the accuracy of the carrier frequency offset (CFO), since any frequency offset
causes a loss of sub-channel orthogonality, which introduces intercarrier interference
(ICI) and hence results in huge degradation in system performance. Thus, precise time
and frequency synchronization in an OFDM wireless system is an essential task for
reliable reception of the transmitted data. Numerous techniques and algorithms have
been proposed in the literature for OFDM time and frequency synchronization.
However, few of them can be applied to MIMO systems without major modifications.
As a consequence, an adaptive technique with a relatively low complexity to acquire
synchronization in an MIMO-OFDM system is expected to be challenging because
now we have to consider the diversity available at the transmitter and receiver which
makes the mathematical manipulations much more complicated.
In this project, an adaptive low-complexity synchronization-acquisition technique in
an MIMO-OFDM wireless system is developed. A robust minimum mean-squared
error (MMSE) linear filtering based on the fuzzy-inference-based adaptive recursive
least-squares (RLS) algorithm is proposed. For the real-time applicability, a
computationally-efficient version of the proposed receiver is derived based on the
least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm with the use of a variable fuzzy-inference step
size control. Furthermore, a time-efficient version of the synchronization-acquisition
detector based on the concept of the reduced-rank multistage Wiener filter (RRMWF)
is considered in this proposal as well. Extensions and applications of an asynchronous
space-time joint DS-CDMA scheme based on the RRMWF have been endeavored in
recent years. Initial results of the RRMWF technique to the issues of synchronization
and demodulation in wireless systems have been achieved. More efforts are going to
be devoted in the MIMO-OFDM wireless communication systems based on the sort
of the computationally-inexpensive adaptive filtering techniques, such as the (2-to-1)-
fuzzy-inference controlled LMS (FLC-LMS or FLC-VBLMS), RLS (FLC-RLS or
FLC-VBRLS), and RRMWF. Hence, it is believed that a bunch of accomplishments

Shift-orthogonal:
We propose the use of constant envelope orthogonal codes with good periodic
correlation properties, such as Frank-Zadoff codes [6]. The periodic correlation

preamble is formed by a repetition of the code, or training symbol, with a different

. Note that this cyclic shift has to be higher than the CIR
length to preserve orthogonality. This results in a preamble as depicted in Fig. 3.2.

The best time instant to estimate the frequency offset is p at which the value of
 reaches its maximum. Note that the maximum estimated frequency offset is
limited, since the angle est that can be estimated without phase ambiguity is limited
to max  . This relates to a maximum frequency offset of
max max / 2 / 2s p s pf f n f n    , which equals half the subcarrier spacing. A larger
range can be achieved by slightly changing the preamble, as was proposed in [10].
However, any frequency offset of an integral multiple of subcarrier spacing can not be
corrected by the frequency offset estimator. In order to increase the range of the
frequency synchronization algorithm, the sequence  10pnnc  in the time domain is first
repeated I times and its N-point FFT is taken to obtain sequence   10pnr nc  , then the
cyclic cross-correlation with the received frequency corrected (from estf ), and
demodulated symbol sequence is carried out using the formula as follows:

The frequency offset of integral number of suhcarrier spacings is estimated using
 arg max k

 , 0,1..., 1k Q  . Hence, the fractional part of the relative frequency
offset is estimated in the time domain and the integral part is estimated in the
frequency domain.
Fine time acquisition consists of finding the start of the useful portion of the OFDM
frame to an accuracy of a few samples. Once the frequency offset is removed, fine
time synchronization can be performed by cross-correlating the received, down
converted and discretized complex samples with the transmitted sequences. The
It is clear from the normalized variance that the accuracy increases linearly with the
number of receive antennas rn and cubically with the training symbol length ( pn ).
Note that the Cramér-Rao lower bound is equal to this theoretical value of the
variance, as was already concluded for the SISO version in [10].
In [11], another design of the preamble and time/frequency synchronization were
proposed for the MIMO-OFDM system as follows:
Preamble design
Let the frame structure of the MlMO OFDM system be as shown in the Fig. 3.3, the
preamble of the OFDM frame consisting of tn training symbols of length I gT n T
where g In T T QT  , 1T is the sample rate at the output of the OFDM modulator.
The time interval IT corresponds to the transmission of In samples where
I
Qn I and I is some integer that divides N . The length g In n preamble
sequences are obtained by exciting every I - th coefficient of a length Q -th frequency
-domain vector with a nonzero training symbol from a chosen alphabet (the remainder
are set to zero). The training sequence for the preamble in the time domain for the
q -th OFDM symbol is given by [11]

where 1,2,...,c Q .
estimates can be obtained by either transmitting more than tn training sequences or
by making the training symbol matrices unitary by using a Gram–Schmidt
orthonormalization procedure as described in [14].
Synchronization algorithm
Time and frequency synchronization can be performed sequentially in the
following steps [15].
Step 1) Coarse Time Synchronization and Signal Detection—
Coarse time acquisition and signal detection locates the start of an OFDM
frame over an approximate range of sample values. Due to the presence of the
CP, coarse time acquisition during the preamble can be performed by
correlating the received samples that are at a distance of In from each other
over a length- gn window Fig. 3.3 ([10,16]).

integer that divides Q . In addition to maximizing, it should also exceed a certain
threshold to reduce the probability of false alarm ( FAP ).
Step 2) Frequency Offset Estimation in the Time Domain—
Any frequency offset between the transmitter and the receiver local oscillators is
reflected in the time domain sequence as a progressive phase shift 2 /Irn Q  ,
where γ is the frequency offset and is defined as the ratio of the actual
frequency offset to the intercarrier spacing. A frequency offset estimate of up to
2
I subcarrier spacings can be obtained based on the phase of the
autocorrelation function as follows:


 
  . Since fine time synchronization is computationally
expensive process, it is carried out for a small window centered around the coarse
time synchronization instant ,j coarsen .
The performance of the fine time synchronization is dependent on the frequency
offset since the presence of any frequency offset reduces the correlation between the
transmitted and the received training sequences. Hence, the frequency offset
algorithm must be executed before fine time synchronization is carried out. Also, we
can take advantages of the fact that the training symbols are sent for tn consecutive
symbol times. Thus, frequency offset estimate can be averaged over tn OFDM
symbols to improve the accuracy. Improved frequency offset estimates result in better
fine time synchronization and vice versa. Hence the inter dependence of the frequency
offset estimate and the optimum synchronization instant can be mitigated.
IV. The Proposed Algorithms
Synchronization schemes based on training symbols must be efficient in terms of
system performance and overhead. Also, they must be able to operate in both burst
and continuous modes communication links. The structure should also aide in channel
estimation since channel estimation is an integral part of the OFDM demodulation. In
this section, two novel time-efficient approaches are proposed to deal with
synchronization in time and frequency domains for the MIMO-OFDM systems. One
is the adaptive MMSE-type time/frequency offset estimator based on the fuzzy-logic
controlled LMS and RLS algorithms, another is the synchronization acquisition based
on the reduced-rank multistage Wiener filter (RRMWF). Both approaches focus
attention on the purpose of the low-complexity real-time applications in the WLANs
as the technique of the cross-correlations extensively studied by most of the research
works. The operations for both of the schemes are briefly explained as follows:
FLC provides an adaptation mechanism that converts the linguistic control strategy
based on the characteristics of mobile radio channels into an adaptive
parameter-control strategy. By using the defuzzification, the fuzzy control decisions
are converted to a crisp control command, which is used to adjust properly the level of
the parameter of interest. To improve the FLC performance, the use of a fuzzy
proportional-plus-integral (PI) control is addressed in [22].
B. The Reduced-Rank Multistage Wiener Filter (RRMWF) [23-27]
A novel low-complexity synchronization acquisition technique that utilizes the
recently developed reduced-rank multistage Wiener filter (RRMWF) of Goldstein and
Reed [23] is developed in this proposal. In the wireless communications system with
transmit diversity, the desired code pattern (signature vector) is usually embedded in
the MAI plus noise. In order to achieve the reliable demodulation, the unknown phase
of the desired code pattern has to be determined in advance. In order to simplify the
detection of the desired code pattern from the interference-plus-noise environment, an
invertible linear transformation T is used to operate on nx . An adaptive filter
weight vector a nw for nxT is designed based on the maximization of the
output signal-to-interference plus noise ratio ( oSNR ). Let the scalar output of the filter
be denoted by [ ]q n , given by

achieve the multistage decomposition of the decision statistic in (4.19), successive
orthogonal decompositions are applied to the observed data. Define jT as the

MSE for a given rank, and if the multistage orthogonal decomposition is carried out
for the full N stages, then the multistage filter is exactly equivalent to the full-rank
classical Wiener filter. Rank reduction is concerned with finding a low-dimension
subspace, say of rank M N (full-rank). Here the rank-M detector is obtained by
stopping the decomposition at stage M, i.e., by setting .M B 0 More details of the
multistage decomposition can be found in [23]. Therefore, the estimate of n that

MAI and Rayleigh fading environment. Evidently, the FLC-RLS achieves a much
better BER performance than other schemes, because of the use of a fuzzy variable
forgetting factor in response to the time-varying channels. Simulation results in Fig.8
show that a significant improvement in BER performance is achieved by the
FLC-based algorithms. More specific, the FLC-LMS approach in Fig.8(a) achieves,
respectively, 3dB and 6dB over the Kwong's and Aboulnasr's VSS-LMS algorithms at
a specific BER requirement of 0.25 (marked by a dashed line in Fig.8(a)) for
multipath Rayleigh-fading channels. The BER improvement is enhanced further when
the FLC-LMS algorithm is compared with the C-LMS and Harris's VSS-LMS
algorithms. Moreover, it is clearly seen from Fig.8(b) that the FLC-RLS approach
accomplishes 8dB, 4dB, 2.1dB, and 1.5dB over the C-RLS, OFFF-RLS, GVFF-RLS,
and VFF-RLS, respectively, at a fixed BER of $4 \times 10^{-2}$ (marked by a
dashed line in Fig.8(b). Also, results show that the FLC-LMS does not perform as
good as the RLS-based approaches in data demodulation, due to its slow convergence
speed, but the FLC-LMS provides a much simpler implementation.
In Fig.9, the BER performance for various LMS and RLS algorithms is presented in
terms of the number of users K for Kl =3, M=2, SNR=10dB, and a multipath fading
rate=1/500 fade cycle/symbol. Each interfering user in the simulations is assumed to
have a received power equal to the desired user. It should be pointed out that an
increase in system capacity is achieved under a fixed performance requirement when
either the FLC-LMS or the FLC-RLS algorithm is employed.
Fig.10(a) depicts the BER performance of the proposed FLC-LMS and FLC-RLS
algorithms as a function of SNR parameterized by the size of the FIS and Fig.10(b)
illustrates the BER performance of the FLC-RLS algorithm versus SNR
parameterized by the P-partitioned MBFs for K=17 (Kintra =15, Kinter =2), Kl =3, M=2,
and a multipath fading rate=1/500 fade cycle/symbol. Experimental results in Fig.10(a)
show that the DS-CDMA systems with a two-input ( ][2 ne , ][2 ne )-FIS outperform
the systems with one-input ( ][2 ne )-FIS. It is noticed that the FLC-LMS with a
( ][2 ne , ][2 ne )-FIS demonstrates a comparable performance in demodulation to the
FLC-RLS with a ( ][2 ne )-FIS. In Fig.10(b), results show that the more regions of the
MBFs are partitioned, the better BER performance is achieved. In addition, the
illustrated in Fig.13(a). This is because the FLC-RLS algorithm with the ( ][2 ne , NT)
-FIS fails to track effectively the statistical variations of the dynamic-fading channels,
due to the use of the fixed-length duration of training. Similar results are shown in
Fig.13(b) for the convergence/tracking performance when the proposed FLC-RLS
algorithm operates in a nonstationary environment with a multipath fading rate=1/200
fade cycle/symbol. Again, the use of a ( ][2 ne , ][2 ne )-FIS demonstrates a much
better convergence and steady-state characteristic in multipath dynamic-fading
channels.
To sum up, results illustrate that an improvement in BER performance is achieved by
the fuzzy-inference-based algorithms. Remarkably, the FLC-RLS approach
accomplishes 8dB, 4dB, 2.1dB, and 1.5dB over the C-RLS, OFFF-RLS, GVFF-RLS,
and VFF-RLS, respectively, at a fixed BER of 4x10-2 for multipath fading channels.
The FLC-LMS approach outperforms the Kwong's and Aboulnasr's VSS-LMS
algorithms about 3dB and 6dB, respectively, at BER=0.25. The BER improvement is
enhanced substantially when the comparison is performed with the C-LMS and
Harris's VSS-LMS algorithms. In addition, the proposed DS-CDMA systems with the
use of a ( ][2 ne , ][2 ne )-FIS demonstrate a much better performance for data
demodulation over DS-CDMA systems with either ( ][2 ne )-FIS or ( ][2 ne , NT)-FIS. It
has to be stressed that the improvement in demodulation is significantly enhanced
when the proposed ( ][2 ne , ][2 ne )-FIS system is employed instead of the
( ][2 ne )-FIS or ( ][2 ne , NT)-FIS system in a time-varying multipath fading
environment. Furthermore, the fuzzy-based LMS and RLS receivers obtain a better
performance than that of the C-LMS and C-RLS receivers and achieve a substantial
improvement in performance as an increasing function of the size of an antenna array
or a fuzzy set. As a consequence, a combination of the ( ][2 ne , ][2 ne )-FIS and
LMS/RLS adaptive filtering techniques provides an effective and robust means for
applications in the MIMO-OFDM communication systems.
