3The rmse values of TOA reflectances TOA
simulated by SACM are less than 0.001 (about
0.0008 and 0.0006 in blue and red bands) for
both CM and UM, when compared with 6S for
wide ranges of parameters. Numerical studies
have been conducted to estimate the induced
errors of retrieved AOD due to the rmse of
TOA by SACM. A DT with the reflectances
c of 0.01 in the blue band is assumed at a
solar zenith angle ( s) of 30o, viewing zenith
angle ( v) of 45o and the relative azimuthal
angle () of 0o. Two contrasts over DT are
considered. The low contrast (LC) and
medium contrast (MC) denote that DT is
surrounded by the background with its
reflectance b =0.06 and b =0.12,
respectively. The results show that the
induced errors are only 0.005 and 0.010 in clear
sky ( a=0.23) and hazy sky ( a=0.76) for MC,
respectively, when aerosol is CM. As for UM,
the errors are about 0.01 for LC and MC in
clear sky, respectively, however, the errors can
be 0.07 and up to 0.14 for LC and MC in hazy
sky, respectively. Therefore, though for both
contrasts the errors are negligible for CM in
both skies as well as for UM in clear sky, they
will be significant in hazy sky for UM,
especially for MC. One should note that it is
because UM with single scattering albedo 0
of 0.65 is more absorptive than CM with 0
of 0.90 in blue band. Detailed explanation of
the significant errors for UM in hazy sky will
be presented in the later section. For
simplicity, these errors are neglected in the
following discussion. Hence, the estimated
AOD errors due to AE should be moderate in
the latter conditions.
Numerical simulations under different
conditions are conducted to study the errors of
retrieved AOD. Visibilities (VIS) are set to 23
km (clear sky) and 5 km (hazy sky), which
correspond to the a values of 0.23 and 0.76
at 550 nm, according to 6S. s are set to 30o
and 60o. v is fixed as 45o by the design of
FORMOSAT-2 RSI. The values of  are set
to 0o (backscattering) and 180o
(forward-scattering). To assess the errors,
relative error /a a  (%), absolute standard
error (ASE) and relative standard error (RSE)
(%) are used. The value of a is defined as
the estimated AOD minus the true AOD; RSE
is defined as the ratio of standard error of
estimated AOD to true AOD. In the numerical
experiments, the true AOD is used to simulate
TOA by considering AE; the estimated AOD is
then retrieved by inverting TOA with all the
same parameters given in the simulation of
TOA , except assuming the uniform surface
( b= c).
Results and Discussion
Figures 1(a)-1(d) illustrate /a a  (%)
due to AE for different c and b in
different VIS in the blue and red bands of
FORMOSAT-2 RSI for CM. s, v and 
are 30o, 45o and 0o, respectively. The values
of c and b are all from 0.00 to 0.12 for
both visibilities and both bands. For a given
c , /a a  increases monotonically as b
increases in both bands and both VIS. On the
other hand, /a a  decreases monotonically
as c increases for given b . If the
background is brighter than the target, i.e.
b> c, ais over-estimated ( a>0) due to
the under-estimation of b. On the contrary,
a is under-estimated ( a<0) due to the
over-estimation of b, if the target is brighter
than the background. These errors are all due
to the negligence of the scattered radiance
reflected from the inhomogeneous surface, i.e.
uniform surface assumption. Since this
phenomenon is quite similar to those cases of
s =60o and/or =180o, their figures are
neglected. However, quantitative analysis will
be discussed as in the following. The values
of /a a  range from –253.3% to 118.3%
and–323.0% to 110.0% for blue and red bands
in clear sky, and they range from –101.8% to
66.7% and–162.5% to 70.0% for both bands in
hazy sky. In fact, a are enhanced in the
5compared to the case for CM. These results
also explain the reason why the induced errors
of retrieved AOD due to the rmses of TOA by
SACM are significant in hazy sky for UM,
especially for MC, as mentioned above. This
reveals the difficulty of aerosol remote sensing
over urban-industrial regions, where highly
inhomogeneous surfaces exist with the small
size of sparsely distributed DTs (Lyapustin et al.
2004).
Conclusion
In this study, the errors of retrieved AOD
due to AE by the DT method for
FORMOSAT-2 RSI bands are investigated with
aid of the fast and accurate SACM. Target
size is considered the same as the spatial
resolution. The results show that the induced
error of retrieved AOD by SACM are
negligible for CM in both skies as well as for
UM in clear sky; however, they are significant
in hazy sky for UM, especially for MC. AE
becomes negligible if the inhomogeneous
surface is not highly reflective; however, it may
cause large RSE_AOD up to 100% and 55%
for MC over DTs in clear and hazy skies in blue
band for CM, as s and  are 30o and 0o.
RSE_AOD is larger for UM compared with
CM, due to the lesser sensitivity of TOA
reflectance to a. This suggests that AE be
considered for MC in both skies, especially for
urban-industrial regions.
