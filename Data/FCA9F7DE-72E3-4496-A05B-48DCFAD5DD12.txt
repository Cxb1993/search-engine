where ϕs and ϕt denote the inclination angles of bs pp and ts pp ; αbi 
and αbo the incident and the refractive angles of the ray at the BS; Rb 
the BS radius; r the radial coordinate.                        
The following inequality must hold to assure the solutions of 
Eqs (2) exist: 
ts pp  > bs pp                                       (3) 
    Then, zt0 and zd0 must have lower bounds and zb0 must have an 
upper bound to assure the inequality holds.  
As the BS radius increases and approaches to infinite, the BS 
becomes a flat one and Eqs (2) can be rewritten as below: 
)sin(cos)sin( bosb0sbott z ϕϕϕϕϕρ −=−              (4a) 
ϕbo = sin-1(sinϕs /n)                                (4b) 
A flat BS may be favorable in fabrication. However, design of a 
lens with a flat BS generally requires that the largest emitting angle of 
the light source must be properly constrained, to assure the 
satisfaction of Eq. (3). Sometimes, it could be necessary to ignore the 
emitting energy of large angle to design a lens with a flat BS. 
Fortunately, such ignorance does not induce a problem since the 
emitting energy of an LED light is normally less significant at a 
larger angle. 
 
III. FORMULATION OF THE LSM PROBLEM 
In this section, the perturbation analysis is applied to the nominal 
system to derive the sensitivity of luminance variation over a DA to 
the LSM. The interested quantities and variables are axially and 
symmetrically distributed at the LOA. Hence, the involved variations 
under the LSM are treated as a one-dimensional problem.  
For the nominal system, the whole cross-sectional profile of FS 
or DA can be formed by the revolution of a representative portion of 
the profile along the LOA. The representative portions for the FS and 
DA are respectively described by a set of mesh points as below: 
    },...,1),,{(~ ϕϕϕρ NjS jsttt ==                    (5a) 
  },...,1),,{(~ ϕNjzyxS jdddd ==                    (5b) 
where tS
~ denotes the set of the FS mesh points; dS
~ the set of the DA 
mesh points; Nϕ  the number of the mesh points.  
For a FS mesh point, the rays through it before and after the 
LSM can be varied in the intensity of luminosity and the direction of 
incidence and refraction. In this study, the variations are classified to 
be two catalogs: the inflow variations and the outflow variations. The 
former catalog includes the variations of the incident direction and 
intensity; the latter includes the variations of the refractive direction 
and intensity, which will determine the luminance variations over the 
DA.  
 
A. Inflow Variations under Small LSM  
Consider that the nominal position of the LED light shown in 
Fig. 3(a) is misaligned from the point ps to ps′. Assume that the LSM 
is small and in the amount of Δzs. The rays through the FS mesh point 
pt before and after the LSM are represented by ps-pb-pt and ps′-pb′-pt, 
respectively. By Eqs (2), the sensitivity of the inflow variations of 
intensity to the LSM can be derived as below:  
        ssbsss zG Δ=−=Δ ϕϕϕ '                            (6) 
Hereafter, a variable with the superscript “’” denotes the variable after 
the LSM; Gsb the sensitivity of the inflow variations of intensity to 
the LSM and

1.0 mm are plotted in black circle points in Fig. 6 where the 
variations by solving Eqs (2) using the Newton’s method are plotted 
in red solid lines. Both variations fairly match with each other for 
small LSM as shown by the cases a1 and a2. However, deviation 
between both variations grows with the degree of the LSM. The 
perturbation solutions underestimate for Δzs > 0 but overestimate for 
Δzs < 0.  
Due to Eq. (3), the solution domain of Eqs (2) is reduced for Δzs 
> 0. The variations grow in monotone from the vertex of the lens to 
the edge. For different directions of the LSM, the variations by 
perturbation change only by sign.  
The net effects of the inflow and outflow variations determine 
the luminance variations as shown in Fig. 7 where the variations have 
been normalized by dividing by the nominal luminance. The 
luminance variations reveal different characters for different 
directions of the LSM. For Δzs < 0, the illumination pattern shrinks in 
size as shown by the cases a1 to e1 in Fig. 7, with strengthened 
luminance at the edge but weakened luminance at the center. For Δzs 
> 0, the pattern expands in size as shown by the cases a2 to e2 in Fig. 
7, with weakened luminance at the edge but strengthened luminance 
at the center.  
To validate the above analytical results, the lens was constructed 
using the Pro-E software. The lens construction and the luminous 
intensity of the light source were imported into the LightTools 
environment for ray-tracing simulation. A plane of 50x50 mm was 
built as the nominal DA with 100x100 cells for luminosity 
accumulation and luminance computation. The luminance variations 
by simulation for Δzs= ±1.0 mm are plotted in black solid lines in Fig. 
8, in comparison with those by analysis by solving the nonlinear 
equation in red circle points. Good compliance in the variation 
character exists between the results from the simulation and the 
analysis. However, the simulation results are much less fine and 
smooth, despite that one million of rays were assigned for tracing. It 
took only a few seconds to solve for the analytical results while more 
than an hour of time was needed to accomplish the ray-tracing 
simulation. 
Different lens topologies to generate the same pattern of nominal 
illumination were designed. The power of lens with the BS radius of 
30 mm and a flat BS against the same LSM was also studied. The lens 
with a larger BS radius is larger in size. The luminance variations by 
simulation and by analysis for the lenses with the BS radius of 30 mm 
and a flat BS are shown in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10, respectively.  
The luminance variations present opposite characters at the edge 
for different directions of the LSM. For Δzs < 0, the luminance at the 
edge tends to be weakened but it tends to be strengthened for Δzs > 0 
as the BS radius increases. For Δzs < 0, the luminance variations at 
the edge could be strengthened by 100% of the nominal luminance if 
the lens with the BS radius of 10 mm is used in the nominal system. 
For Δzs > 0, the luminance variations could be strengthened at the 
edge by 50% of the nominal luminance if the lens with a flat BS is 
used in the nominal system.  
 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
In LED illumination applications with a FS lens, LSM may 
cause large luminance variations from a nominal design and the 
variations could lead to unpleasant quality of illumination. Previous 
studies for the LSM problem were mostly based on the ray-tracing 
simulation. However, such a simulation approach is inefficient in use 
of the computer time to achieve statistically conclusive results.  
Instead, this study proposes an analytical approach to investigate 
the LSM problem where the misalignment occurs along the LOA. 
The proposed analysis is based on applying the Snell’s law and the 
trigonometry at the FS and BS of the lens. The formulations 
developed based on the perturbation analysis are applicable for the 
problems with small LSM. The formulations developed based on 
solving Eqs (2) extend the applicability for large LSM as well. The 
superiority of the proposed approach over the simulation approach on 
saving the computer time has been demonstrated by examples. The 
adequacy of the developed formulations has been confirmed by cross 
validation.  
FS lenses with distinct BS topologies are available for design to 
achieve an identical illumination pattern. In this study, spherical 
topologies with different BS radiuses are illustrated to investigate 
their power on reduction of the luminance variations against the 
LSM. Different characters of luminance variations were achieved for 
different directions of the LSM. For Δzs < 0, the illumination pattern 
shrinks in size, with strengthened luminance at the edge but 
weakened luminance at the center if the BS radius is small. The 
luminance variation at the edge could be strengthened by 100% of the 
nominal luminance, but it tends to be weakened as the BS radius 
increases. For Δzs > 0, the pattern expands in size, with weakened 
luminance at the edge but strengthened luminance at the center. The 
luminance variation at the edge tends to be strengthened as the BS 
radius increases. It could be strengthened by 50% of the nominal 
luminance if the BS becomes flat. It is expected that an optimal BS 
radius might exist for design with the highest power and the minimal 
luminance variations against the LSM.  
Good compliance in the variation character exists between the results 
from the simulation and the analysis. However, the simulation results 
are much less fine and smooth, despite that one million of rays were 
assigned for tracing. Extension of the proposed analysis to include the 
LSM along a direction on a plane normal to the LOA is untaken.
