Abstract 
The project investigated the optimum 
design of the reflective structure and the light 
source position for the LED backlight module.  
We used the R, G, B tricolor solely sealed LED 
to compose the white light back light source 
and make the whole optical simulation test by 
the optical simulation software to get the 
preliminary optics characteristic.  Furthermore, 
we will do the optimization design of the 
reflective structure and the light source position 
by the Genetic Algorithms.  Simulation results 
showed that the indispensable optical elements 
for the conventional direct LED backlight unit, 
such as the diffuser sheet, and diffuser plate can 
be eliminated via the inserted 
reflective-triangular structure.  Without any 
optical films, brightness uniformity of 
83~91.8% for several 22” direct LED backlight 
unit with a thickness of 20~30mm with 
optimized double-triangular structure was 
obtained by the project. 
  We will examine and confirm the color 
brightness and the value of shades of color of 
the designed result by the Light Ports 
Integrating Sphere and other measurement 
apparatus in the future.  Furthermore, the 
integration test results will compare with the 
theory results and make appropriate revision to 
enable the overall back light module to satisfy 
the business demands.

Abstract 
 
A large size direct LED BLU consisted of double-
triangular structures to control the light from RGB 
side emitting LEDs without the indispensable optical 
elements for the conventional direct LED BLU, such as 
the brightness enhancement film, diffuser sheet, and 
diffuser plate was proposed. A genetic algorithm was 
used in this paper to search the optimal parameters of 
the shape of the double-triangular structures and the 
layout of the LEDs to obtain optimum optical 
performances. Without diffuser and BEF, brightness 
uniformity of 91.87%, color uniformity of 0.042 and 
on-axis brightness increase of 50.23% for 22” direct 
LED backlight unit with a thickness of 30mm with 
optimized double-triangular structure was obtained.  
 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD) are one of the most 
competitive large size flat panel displays in recent 
years. Because of the non-emission property of LCD, 
direct backlight units (BLU) are used to provide extra 
illuminant for large size LCD. Therefore, the 
performances of BLU, such as luminance, brightness 
uniformity, color gamut, color uniformity, and 
directivity are significantly important for LCD. A 
conventional BLU consists of various kinds of 
elements, for example, light sources and optical films. 
For the light sources, Red, Green and Blue (RGB) side-
emitting light emitting diodes (LED) have been widely 
used for direct BLU due to their excellent color 
performance, long lifetime, mercury free, etc [1-2]. 
Optical films, such as reflectors, diffuser planes, 
diffuser sheets, or brightness enhancement films (BEF), 
are used to perform the function controlling the light 
from light sources for improving luminance, brightness 
uniformity, color uniformity, and directivity in 
conventional BLU. But the optical films which were 
not perfect transparent leaded to decrease the optical 
efficiency. Thus, to control the light by changing the 
cavity structures and eliminating optical films becomes 
a choice to improve the luminance, thin the thickness, 
and lower the cost for BLU.  
As mentioned above, a large size direct BLU 
consists of double-triangular structures, which are 
around RGB side emitting LEDs and reflecting the 
light from LEDs directly to viewers, is proposed. 
Moreover, the light from LEDs is controllable by 
changing the shape of the double-triangular structures, 
which can be designed by optical-ray-trace simulation, 
to obtain optimum brightness uniformity, color 
uniformity and directivity. In this paper, a genetic 
algorithm (GA) is used to solve the optimum problem 
of the form of the double-triangular structures and the 
layout of LEDs. A single-objective problem is 
combined the brightness uniformity, color uniformity 
and directivity as fitness to search the maximum value 
by normalizing and using fixed weight coefficients for 
this multi-objective problem [3-4]. With optimized 
double-triangular structures and the layout of LEDs, 
brightness uniformity of 91.87%, color uniformity of 
0.042 and on-axis brightness increase of 50.23% for 
22” direct LED BLU with a thickness of 30mm without 
optical films was obtained. It is clear that the double-
triangular structures not only integrates controlling the 
lights with the LED BLU to leave out optical films, but 
also provides excellent work, thinner thickness and 
lower cost for LED BLU. The simulation results are of

In this paper, the directivity was defined as an on-
axis brightness increase, and the on-axis brightness 
increase could be written as 
on-axis brightness increase =   
(I'v-Iv)/Iv×100и (3)
where the Iv' and Iv were the luminous intensity on the 
optical axis with and without the double-triangular 
structure, respectively. Figure 6 illustrates the 
brightness uniformity, the color uniformity and the on-
axis brightness increase of the BLU with different 
double-triangular structures. 
The results indicate that the positions of the LEDs 
are the function of the optical performance of the 
designing group with the double-triangular structure. 
Clearly, there is enough evidence to prove that the light 
in the cavity is dependent of the shape of the double-
triangular structures and the layout of LEDs, these 
design parameters could be optimized to provide the 
required performance for direct LED BLU.

3. Optimum scheme 
 
In this paper, to design the double-triangular 
structures to control the light was proposed to optimum 
the optical performance for LED BLU. There were 14 
parameters for the proposed LED BLU needed to be 
decided. The multi-objective problem leaded to the 
aforementioned brightness uniformity (1), color 
uniformity (2), and on-axis brightness increase (3). The 
GA was used to search the optimum dimensions. In this 
study, the GA program was constructed from roulette 
wheel selection, one point crossover, simple mutation 
and binary inversion. Other parameters of the GA were 
set as shown in Table 1.  
Besides, a single-objective problem was combined 
with the three objectives as fitness to search the 
maximum value by normalizing and using fixed weight 
coefficients for the multi-objective problem. The 
weight coefficients assigned should satisfy below 
condition:  
Z=w1f1+w2f2+w3f3 (4)
w1+w2+w3=1 (5)
where Z was the combined function, w was the weight 
coefficients, f1 was the brightness uniformity (1), f2 was 
the color uniformity (2) and f3 was the on-axis 
brightness increase (3), and set w1 = 0.45, w2 = 0.45, w3 
= 0.1.  
By reducing the searching time of the optimizing 
program, a single group of the LEDs and double-
triangular structures was optimized first. The GA 
procedure was executed via MATLAB® and 
TraceProTM, and the flow chart could be represented as 
Figure 7. The searching ranges of GA must large
