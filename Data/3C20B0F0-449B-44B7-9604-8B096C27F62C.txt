As the demand of the product quality gets more stringent, the understanding of the total 
dimensions of a finished product, including the inner geometry, becomes more important. Therefore, 
a technique in reverse engineering that can achieve the purpose is definitely needed. Most of the 
nondestructive method shown in Fig. 1, such as a coordinate measurement machine (CMM) and laser 
triangulation, cannot be employed to obtain the inside geometry of an object that the probe of a CMM 
or the laser beam cannot reach.  Although Computer Topology (CT) and Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging (MRI) can show the inner structure of an object, the disadvantages of high cost and low 
resolution (0.5 mm or more) [3] result in the very limited use in industry.  Compared to CT and MRI, 
a 3D digitizer can achieve high resolution with a relative low cost [4]. Therefore, the use of the 
destructive method, a 3D digitizer, is needed so that the inner structure of an object can be obtained 
precisely. The work flow of a 3D digitizer is shown in Fig. 2. The machining unit of a 3D digitizer 
removes the material of an object layer by layer and a camera or scanner captures the images for all the 
cross sections. Then it stacks up all the images to reconstruct the CAD model. Two major drawbacks 
of a 3D digitizer are: First, it is a destructive method. Therefore, it cannot be directly used for unique 
or expensive objects. For this kind of objects, a mold may be made out of the original object to create 
the replica so that a 3D digitizer can be applied to it. Second, it may take a long time (several hours) to 
obtain the images of all the cross sections of an object.

A 3D digitizer has been studied by a few companies and research institutes. The most known 
company who produces commercial 3D digitizers is probably CGI in the USA. CGI used CNC 
milling machines to remove the material layer by layer and CCD cameras to capture images. The 
repeatability of CGI’s 3D digitizer is ± 0.0127 mm and the range of the layer cutting thickness is 
0.0127 – 0.2540 mm [5]. Little information is open to the public on CGI’s 3D digitizers so the 
technical details are mostly unknown.  
Yang et. al. [6] presented a 3D digitizer that was similar to CGI’s. They used SIMENS 802S 
numerical control system to control a milling machine. A 600 DPI (dots per inch) optical scanner 
(Mirage D-16L) was used to capture images, which is the major difference from CGI’s 3D digitizers. 
For an optical scanner, the actual length that each pixel represents is fixed. The length that a pixel 
8 Advanced Manufacture 2007
For the machining unit, a 3-axis grinder (Jim-Mao Tech., Model No. GM 28) was modified to 
serve the purpose. The axes of the original grinder were driven by hands. To achieve an automatic 3D 
digitizer, a motion control unit was installed. Three stepping motors (Japan Servo, Model No. 
KH56KM2-903) were employed to drive the three axes, respectively. The sensors for detecting the 
positions of the three axes were linear scales. The minimum resolution for the linear scales was 0.005 
mm. An industrial PXI computer with motion control card (National Instruments, Model No. 
PXI-7344) was used to receive the feedback signals from the linear scales and send control signals to 
the stepping motors to move the three axes to the desired positions. A vision unit was used to capture 
the images after the material was removed layer by layer. A CCD camera (SONY, Model No. 
XCD-X710, resolution 1024×768) and a white-light LED were used in the vision unit. During the 
material removal process, the debris might stay on the surface of the cross section, which might result 
in noises on the captured images. Therefore, a high-pressure air to blow off the debris and a vacuum 
cleaner to collect the debris were used. The finished 3D digitizer is shown in Fig. 4.  
Since a grinder was used in the 3D digitizer, the selection of the grinding wheel was of importance 
for the results of the 3D digitizer. The common abrasive materials for a grinding wheel are silicon 
carbide, aluminum oxide, cubic boron nitride, manufactured diamonds, etc. Silicon carbide is suitable 
for both ductile material (e.g. aluminum, brass, stainless steel) and brittle material (e.g. cast iron, 
ceramic) [9]. Since the 3D digitizer was designed for general purpose use, silicon carbide was 
selected for the abrasive material of the grinding wheel. In addition, to obtain a better surface finish 
with a grinding depth of about 0.01 mm, the grain size of 100 (fine level) and the structure of J 
(medium-density level) were selected. Eventually a Kinik 1A100×16×20.000GC100J8V2000 
grinding wheel was used for the study.

2.2 Software Several programs were developed to read the feedback signals from the linear scales, 
to control the motion of the grinder and to capture the images by using the CCD camera. The 
programming language used in the study was LabVIEW, which is developed by National Instruments. 
It is very easy to generate LabVIEW codes with graphical user interface (GUI) to control stepping 
motors and CCD cameras so it was selected as the programming language. The GUI of the 3D

3. An Application Example 
An example for the initial feasibility study of the 3D digitizer is shown in Fig. 7. The picture on the 
left of Fig. 7 was a component made of copper alloy whose outside diameter was about 9.12 mm, and 
the picture on the right was its CAD model created by using the 3D digitizer. It could be seen that the 
CAD model was close to the original component, except for the roughness on the surface. A 
quantitative study will be presented in Section 4. The roughness might be due to the finite resolution 
of the CCD camera and the tiny burr created during the grinding process. The former could be 
improved by using a higher resolution CCD camera, and the later might be improved by using a better 
mounting method and an optimized grinding condition. In this study, the cold mounting method was 
used to fix objects in epoxy. It was found out that the hot mounting method have better edge 
protection to effectively reduce the burr formation. However, the hot mounting technique cannot be 
applied to objects which cannot stand for heat and pressure.

4. System Analysis 
4.1 Accuracy Accuracy is the discrepancy between the measured dimension and the actual 
dimension. In the study, an object of length 5.50 mm measured by using optical microscope was used 
as a basis for comparison. Then the 3D digitizer was used to measure the length at various working 
distance. The working distance started from 55 mm. Then it was increased with 7 mm increment until 
125 mm. At each working distance, the calibration kit mentioned in Section 2 was used before the 
measurement was performed. The measured results are shown in Table 1.
