H.264 is a high coding efficiency video 
standard [2]. However, a watermarking 
technique for H.264 is difficult to develop 
because H.264 provides low bit rates and high 
resolution compared to previous standards, eg 
H.263, MPEG2.  
  G. Qiu et al. [3] modified AC coefficients 
along the diagonal positions in each 4x4 DCT 
block within intra-frames for watermarking. 
However, the modification method is more 
sensitive to various noise attacks. Noorkami et 
al. [4] embedded watermark into selective 4x4 
DCT blocks in intra-frames. The specific AC 
coefficient in 4x4 blocks within intra-frame is 
modified by even-odd watermark embedding 
technique. However, this embedding method is 
not robustness enough to resist malice attacks. 
  In this project, we propose a low complexity 
video watermarking system for H.264 video 
standard. Watermark is embedded in the 
quantized AC coefficients of intra frames, and 
the block polarity and activity index 
modulation are used to extract watermark 
without the original video sequence [5].  
The report is organized as follows. Section 2 
presents the proposed activity index 
modulation (AIM) watermarking system in 
H.264. AIM watermark embedding and 
extraction procedures are described in Section 
2 and Section 3, respectively. Simulation 
results are given in Section 4. Finally, the 
conclusions and future works are drawn in 
Section 5.。 
 
2. Activity Index Modulation (AIM) for 
H.264 video watermarking 
H.264 is an advanced standard that supplies 
several prediction modes in intra and inter 
frames. The original intra frame is divided into 
non-overlapping 16x16 macroblocks with each 
macroblock containing sixteen 4x4 blocks. For 
each macroblock, the one/sixteen prediction 
costs are estimated to obtain the minimum 
rate-distortion (R-D) cost from the left and up 
neighborhood macroblocks [2]. The intra 
prediction defines four different modes for an 
entire macroblock (denoted as I16MB) and 
nine different modes for a 4x4 block (denoted 
as I4MB), respectively. Each one of 4x4/16x16 
macroblock utilizes one of nine/four prediction 
modes in I4MB/I6MB prediction, respectively. 
In order to compress video sequence and 
embed watermark at the same time, the 
embedding algorithm is integrated in the H.264 
encoder, which is illustrated in Fig.1. In H.264 
encoder, only I4MB is used for embedding 
watermark because the I16MB and 
neighborhood are very similar. If embedding 
watermark at smooth regions, then the decoder 
may causes visible artifacts effects. The 
embedding procedure is described as follows. 
Fig.1. H.264 encoder with the watermark embedding. 
The extracting algorithm is also integrated in 
the H.264 decoder, which is shown as Fig.2. 
Intra frames are selected from watermarked 
video sequences after entropy decoding. Then, 
the watermark extraction procedure is used to 
extract watermark.

4. Simulation results 
Simulations are performed to evaluate the 
proposed AIM watermarking system. In the 
simulations, two video sequences, i.e., Akiyo, 
and Foreman (size of 176x144 and 100 frames), 
are tested as experimental samples. The [M1, 
M2 ] are set (10.5, 20.5), the interval size Δ is 3 
and 5, and the GOP is set 10, which contains 
one I frame and nine P frames. In this paper, 
we will test recompression, Gaussian noise, 
3x3 Gaussian filtering, and temporal attacks for 
evaluating the performance of the proposed 
watermarking system, which is measured by 
JM 8.6 H.264 codec [6] and Stirmark software 
[7]. The normalized correlation (NC) is used to 
measure the robustness of AIM watermarking 
system. 
First, we observe the perceptual quality with 
the average PSNR of compressed 
un-watermarked video and compressed 
watermarked video. Fig. 6. compares the PSNR 
with different QP from 26 to 30 for 
un-watermarked and watermarked video. The 
watermark is invisible after embedding, and the 
watermarked video is as well as the original 
video.

  Blind watermarking method is proposed in the conference CCECE to evaluate data 
embedding techniques for H.264 video signals with robustness against various signal 
processing functions.  
In the proposed system, block polarity and index modulation are used to achieve blind 
watermark detection. The block polarity is determined based on the nonzero quantized DC 
coefficient in each 4×4 integer DCT block. The block index is the pseudo-quantized block 
activity that is represented by the sum of magnitude of quantized AC coefficients. The block 
index modulation is performed based on the watermark and the blocks polarity. The 
watermark embedding is performed by the index modulation, which modifies the quantized 
AC coefficient values by a small amount to force the activity to be quantized into a specific 
region. coefficient in each 4×4 integer DCT block. The block index is the pseudo-quantized 
block activity that is represented by the sum of magnitude of quantized AC coefficients. The 
block index modulation is performed based on the watermark and the blocks polarity. The 
watermark embedding is performed by the index modulation, which modifies the quantized 
AC coefficient values by a small amount to force the activity to be quantized into a specific 
region.

because the I16MB and neighborhood are very similar. If a 
watermark embedded in smooth regions, then the decoder 
may produce visible artifacts effects. The embedding 
procedure is described as follows.

2.1. Watermark Embedding Structure 
The block diagram of the proposed watermark embedding 
procedure is illustrated in Fig. 2. First, Block polarity 
decision is used to select blocks that are suitable for 
embedding watermark. Block index modulation then 
performed based on the watermark and the block polarity. 
The watermark sequence is processed by random permutation 
to enhance its security. The index modulation slightly 
modifies the quantized AC coefficient values to force the 
activity to be quantized into a specific region. Finally, dead 
zone evacuation is used to enhance the robustness. The 
details embedding processes are described as follows. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig.2. The block diagram of the proposed watermark 
embedding procedure 
 
2.1.1 Block Polarity Decision 
The quantized DC coefficient is used to determine the 
block polarity, which is used to filter out blocks that are not 
suitable for watermark embedding. If the quantized DC 
coefficient is zero, then the block polarity is set to “0”. 
Otherwise, the block polarity is set to “1”, which is described 
as  
 
                                                                                          (1) 
 
where BPi denotes the block polarity of i-th block, and BPi 
=1 is a candidate for embedding the watermark. 
2.1.2 Block Activity Index Modulation 
The block activity is an important factor for watermark 
embedding because the block activity indicates the variation 
of quantized AC coefficients. The sum of magnitude of 
quantized AC coefficients in a 4×4 block, which is selected 
for embedding watermark, is in the range [M1, M2 ], i.e., the 
values of M1 and M2 are determined according to the video 
property. The range [M1, M2] can be divided into n sections 
and the size of each section denotes Δk as shown in Fig. 3.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig.3. Activity index modulation and ● is the original 
summation. x and o are modulated summation. 
 
Each section is assigned a unique index number. The block 
activity index applies an index number for the block activity. 
The activity index modulation is accomplished by 
modulating the least significant bit (LSB) of the activity 
index. If the LSB of the index is not the same as the 
embedded watermark bit, then the LSB of index should be 
modulated by one bit. 
 
2.1.3 Dead Zone Evacuation 
The host video signal will be subjected to malicious 
attacks, the quantized AC coefficients will be changed and 
then the LSB of the block index may be altered. The T is a 
threshold value, and the dead zone is defined as 2T. The sum 
of magnitude of quantized AC coefficients in the dead zone 
is moved out. The shift magnitude is small, almost not 
affecting the video quality, and enhances the robustness for 
watermark extracting. The modified sum value of magnitude 
S’ is described as follows. 
 
                                                                                       (2) 
                            
 
where Bi represents the i-th boundary of activity index 
section, S denotes the sum value of magnitude,Δk is the 
section size, and MPi is the middle point of i-th section. Here 
is an example of dead zone evacuation as shown in Fig. 4.
