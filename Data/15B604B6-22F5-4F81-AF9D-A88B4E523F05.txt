 truss designs by controlling the displacement of a specific pin-connection. The two equations are 
integrated by a line search procedure. 
2.1. Stress ratio equation  
 The stress-ratio equation is an iterative formula, and is defined as follow:

axial force of i-th beam element calculated by the matrix analysis of structure. 
 If the cross-section sizes of the beam elements of a truss are divided into P groups, then the

generation group cross-section size vector, + lSmax,  and

lSmax,  are the maximum tension and 
compression forces of l-th group beam elements. Notably, some cross-section sizes sometime might 
converge to zero. If the computed cross-section sizes are smaller than a threshold value ( 210−  in this 
report), then the cross-section sizes are set to the small values ( 610−  in this report). 
2.2. Heuristic equation of modifying cross-section sizes 
Herein, a magnification equation and several heuristic rules based on the unit load method are 
developed to modify a transition design to fit the displacement constraint. The unit load method is a 
specific way to calculate the displacement of a specified pin-connection of a truss structure. The unit 
load method for truss structures is defined as follows:

where d  is the displacement of a specified pin-connection by subjecting k-th load condition to the 
truss structure, iu  is the axial force of the i-th member when an unit load is subjected at the specified 
node, kU  is an unit load condition corresponding to the k-th load condition, and 
id  is the i-term of 
d . In equation (3), iE  and il  are constant values; iS  and iu  are function of cross-section sizes, but 
are not sensitive to the cross-section sizes. In other words, iA  and 
id  are almost inversely 
proportional to each other. If 0>id , then magnifying iA  decreases d . Conversely, if 0<id , 
then magnifying iA  increases d . According to the above mention, a magnification equation and 
corresponding heuristic rules are defined as follows:

 condition corresponding to the maximum displacement of design ,...),( 21 LLA′  is selected as the 
major load condition, and the pin-connection corresponding to the maximum displacement is set as a 
control point. As soon as the major load condition is selected, the initial data for the heuristic 
modification are set as follows:

)),,,(( 321 majorii ULLLuu A′=   
where { },..., 21 LLLmajor ∈  and majorU  is an unit load condition corresponding to majorL . A 
golden-section line search algorithm is used to update the value of α  for controlling the 
displacement design strategy. Assume that the desired value of α  is located in the interval [ Lα , 
Uα ], and two inserted points aα  and bα  can be determined by  
)(6180.0 LUUa αααα −−=                                            (8) 
)(6180.0 LULb αααα −+=                                            (9) 
where the value of 0.6180 is a root of the equation 012 =−+ kk . If the design result corresponding 
to aα  satisfies all stress constraints and is lighter than the design result corresponding to bα , then 
range of α  is narrow down in the interval [ Lα , bα ]. Otherwise the range α  is narrow down in the 
interval [ aα , Uα ]. Although the golden section search uses two inserted points to predict the location 
of desired value per iteration, the search requires only one function evaluation per iteration. The 
reason is that the left inserted point on present iteration and the right inserted point on next iteration 
are overlapped as the upper bound of interval is updated, and the right inserted point on present 
iteration and the left inserted point on next iteration are overlapped as the lower bound of interval is 
updated. In this study, the stop criterion is defined as that the relative difference of weight of trusses 
corresponding to aα  and bα  is smaller than 0.1% in the last iteration.  
Phase 3:  Miner load design phase 
This phase is to ensure that the design result by step 2 is always feasible when any miner load 
condition (load conditions except the major load condition) is subjected. This phase is an auxiliary 
modification, which is necessary only when the maximum displacement of the design result 
corresponding to a miner load condition is larger than the allowable displacement. The miner load 
design also uses the heuristic modification, and the initial data are set as follows: 
AA ′′= β  where 10 ≤< β  
),( min erii LSS A ′′=   
),( min erii Uuu A ′′=  
where { },..., 21min LLL er ∈  and erU min is an unit load condition corresponding to erLmin . The golden 
section line search algorithm is adopted to update the value of β  (corresponded parameters 
includes Lβ , aβ , bβ , Uβ ). If the design result corresponding to aβ  satisfies all stress and 
displacement constraints, then range of β  is narrow down in the interval [ Lβ , bβ ]. Otherwise the 
range β  is narrow down in the interval [ aβ , Uβ ]. 
Phase 4: Buckling design phase 
If a truss design problem includes a buckling constraint, then the buckling phase is necessary to 
ensure that the buckling stress of a compressive truss member exceeds its suffered stress. First, 
magnify the cross-section sizes of buckling truss members by the following equation: 
 was 2.819, the weight of the truss design was 468.37 lb, and the truss design was (10-6, 0.359, 3.399, 
10-6, 1.874, 0.78, 0.107, 3.971). So far, the 2nd, 6th, and 7th group cross-section sizes were 
corresponded to buckling truss members. Therefore, the buckling design phase was used to solve the 
problem. Table 1 shows design history of the buckling design phase. After 11 iterations, the last 
design was (10-6, 0.672, 2.777, 10-6, 1.531, 1.097, 1.168, 3.245). Moreover, the final design results by 
the size limit phase were (0.100, 0.672, 2.777, 0.100, 1.531, 1.097, 1.168, 3.245). Table 2 shows the 
comparisons of design results for the 25-bar truss. The second column is the design results by the 
heuristic search approach, and the last columns is the design results in reference [6]. As indicated 
from the table, the computing result by the heuristic search approach is smaller than the reference 
solution. If carry the cross-section sizes to the first decimal place, then the weights of the two truss 
designs are almost the same. 
 
 (四)結論 
This paper proposes a heuristic search approach for civil engineers to obtain a solution near the 
optimal design of truss structures under an acceptable computational time. The main strategy of the 
heuristic search is to transform the multi-variable truss design problems into one-variable 
optimization problems. The heuristic search approach can be considered as an effective soft 
computing approach in handling size and topology optimizations of truss structures. The 
computational time of the heuristic search is nearly independent on the number of truss members 
because the heuristic search approach always uses only one variable to control its search.
