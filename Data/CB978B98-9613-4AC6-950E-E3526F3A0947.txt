1. Introduction 
Conventional non-destructive steel bridge coating assessment is done through human 
visual inspection which could hardly produce consistent and convincing results. 
Compared to human visual inspection, computerized digital image recognition could 
generate more accurate steel bridge coating assessment results with better efficiency, 
consistency, and objectivity. This explains why image processing is popular and 
widely used nowadays. In addition to the color-distinguishing ability, digital image 
recognition can efficiently process a large number of steel bridge coating images (i.e., 
rust images) in a systematic way, and thus provides an avenue for automated rust 
image recognition. 
Despite the effectiveness and efficiency of image processing techniques, there are still 
some problems which greatly affect the accuracy of recognition results. Nonuniform 
illumination is one of them. In view of this, this research aims to develop methods 
that could mitigate the nonuniform illumination problem in steel bridge coating 
assessment. 
 
2. Research Objectives 
This research project comes with two objectives: 
1. To process color rust images directly and automatically; and 
2. To simultaneously reduce the effects of shades and highlights for steel bridge 
coating images. 
 
3. Literature Review 
Most previous studies processed rust images in grayscale. For instance, AbdelRazig 
proposed a neural-network-based method in 1999, and Chen et al. proposed a 
neuro-fuzzy recognition approach (NFRA) and multiresolution pattern classification 
(MPC) method in 2001 to process rust images in grayscale [1-3]. 
In 2005, Lee started to process rust images in color [4]. However, Lee’s model is not 
completely automated and cannot really solve the nonuniform illumination problem in 
rust defect recognition. In 2009, Chen et al. proposed an adaptive ellipse approach 
(AEA) to process rust images in color [5]. AEA can fairly mitigate the nonuniform 
illumination problem, but is less accurate in recognizing rust images with red or 
brown coating colors. 
In view of the aforementioned problems, this project aims to develop methods that 
can greatly mitigate the nonuniform illumination problem in rust defect recognition 
and produce accurate recognition results in an automated way. 
 
4. Research Methods 
After comprehensively studying the image processing methods used in other 
engineering fields [6-19], two effective methods for rust defect recognition are

5. Research Results 
The research results of the box-and-ellipse-based ANFIS (BE-ANFIS) and the 
BEMD-morphology approach (BMA) are shown in the following subsections. 
 
5.1. Effectiveness of BE-ANFIS 
The recognition results of BE-ANFIS were compared to the recognition results of the 
adaptive ellipse approach (AEA) and the fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm, one of the 
most popular approaches, to show the robustness of BE-ANFIS in recognizing rust 
intensity. For comparison purposes, artificial rust images of the size of 256×256 pixels 
and their corresponding maps were created. An example of the artificial rust image is 
shown in Figure 3. 
 
Figure 3. Artificial rust image and its map 
The comparison results of BE-ANFIS with AEA and with FCM are shown in Figures 
4 and 5, respectively. In Figure 4, in which the rust image is slightly brighter on the 
left side, it can be seen that AEA misclassifies some light rust colors into background, 
while BE-ANFIS correctly distinguishes light rust colors from dark rust colors and 
background. In Figure 5, FCM misclassifies light rust colors into dark rust colors, 
while BE-ANFIS does the right classification. Since FCM does not deal with 
nonuniformly illuminated images well, the rust image used in Figure 5 is uniformly 
illuminated. Based on the comparison results, the effectiveness of BE-ANFIS is 
proven.

Figure 6 shows that BMA performs well in both shaded and non-shaded rust images. 
In Figure 6(a), BMA effectively eliminates shades and recognizes rust spots 
(including warps and protrusions). The effectiveness of BMA is also proven in Figure 
6(b), which contains a non-shaded rust image.

6. Conclusions and Recommendations 
In this project, two innovative and effective bridge coating assessment methods, the 
box-and-ellipse-based ANFIS (BE-ANFIS) and the BEMD-morphology approach 
(BMA), were developed. The effectiveness of both BE-ANFIS and BMA on rust 
defect recognition under non-uniform illumination has been proven through 
comparisons with other popular approaches. 
Despite the effectiveness of BE-ANFIS and BMA, their processing times are not short 
enough to support real-time steel bridge coating assessment. Therefore, how to 
develop a faster and more effectiveness rust defect recognition method which can be 
used for real-time bridge inspection will be the next step. 
Note: In addition to BE-ANFIS and BMA, there are two other methods under 
development (90% complete) and not listed in the report. One of them is using the 
support vector machine (SVM), and the other using the Fourier transform. Although 
the two methods are not 100% complete, they have been published in conferences, 
which are listed in the Self Assessment of Research Outcome section.
