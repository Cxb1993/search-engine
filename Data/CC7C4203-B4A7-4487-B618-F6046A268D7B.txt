(二) 計畫英文摘要 
WDM transport systems that use different optical channels to carry combined 
signals would be quite useful for a fiber transport network providing multiple services. 
PON is a candidate to carry out fiber-to-the-home architecture. There has been 
increasing attention in implementing next generation broadband network by using 
WDM-PON, it is because WDM-PON can provide large transmission capacity, 
network security, and flexibility. For a practical implement of WDM-PON, however, 
cost-effective light source is the key issue for system designer. To build a WDM-PON 
with high linearity and low noise requirements, we should reluctantly choose laser 
diode (LD) which operates in a single longitudinal mode. Many techniques, like the 
use of DFB LDs, have been proposed to obtain the single longitudinal mode operation. 
But, DFB LDs are expensive light sources for WDM-PON. Directly modulated FP 
and VCSEL are promising for high-speed digital optical communication systems, 
such as Gigabit Ethernet application. Such FP and VCSEL operate in a single mode 
with external light injection technique could be employed to replace DFB LD in 
WDM-PON for digital baseband signals transmission. 
In the third year, a high definition television (HDTV)/Gigabit Ethernet over 
bidirectional WDM-PON based on injection-locked FP LDs is proposed, using a 
4-wavelength system as an example. Transmission performance over 40km of a 
standard single-mode fiber (SMF) was investigated. Improved performance of BER 
and clear eye diagram are expected to obtain in our proposed bidirectional 
WDM-PON.

一、報告內容 
（一）前言 
    分波多工 (WDM) 傳輸系統能夠充分使用光纖的頻寬，且因為它在一蕊光
纖中同時傳送多個波長的光信號，可以大幅增加光信號的傳輸容量；因此對於光
纖網路而言，是一個相當具有吸引力的傳輸系統。而混合式分波多工 (Hybrid 
WDM) 傳輸系統乃是使用不同的光波長來傳輸不同型態的光信號，對於應用在
光纖網路傳輸上提供整合型的服務是相當有效益的，諸如電信傳輸或是網際網路
等不同型態的服務。在以往所發表的 Papers 當中，就 WDM 及 Hybrid WDM 這
兩個領域而言，分別都有為數相當多的 Papers 發表在不同的專業光電期刊上 
[1]-[5]。現今人們對各種資訊應用的渴望驅動下，網路的頻寬成為無盡的追求目
標。擁有高頻寬、大容量等特性的光纖，將逐漸取代傳統銅線傳輸，成為下一代
網路媒介佈署的不二之選。光纖佈建已快速從骨幹、都會網路朝向接取網路發
展，造成眾多寬頻光接取網路技術的競相出現，被動光纖網路 (PON) 就是實現
寬頻光接取網路最有潛力的技術。被動光纖網路近年來在光通訊領域展露頭腳，
主要的原因乃是因為建構這樣的系統其價格成本相較於其他的光纖網路系統而
言要來得便宜許多。分波多工傳輸系統與被動光纖網路的結合對於寬頻網路的具
體化是相當具有吸引力的，因為分波多工被動光纖網路 (WDM-PON) 傳輸系統
能夠提供更大的傳輸容量，確保網路的安全與穩定性，及網路使用較具彈性及易
於管理等優質特點 [6]-[15]。 
在以往所看到的分波多工被動光纖網路系統其雷射光源都是以 DFB 雷射二
極體為主，由於 DFB 雷射二極體光譜具備單一縱模輸出特性，使用單一縱模輸
出特性的雷射可以使系統傳輸性能得到優化。不過也由於單一縱模輸出特性之
故，使得 DFB 雷射光源價格偏高，這對於分波多工被動光纖網路具體化應用的
推展造成了阻力。近年來在短距離、數位光通訊應用上 VCSEL 已展露頭腳，逐
漸用來取代 DFB 雷射二極體。這主要是因為 VCSEL 低功率輸出特性正適用於

（二）研究目的 
此一研究計畫希冀建構「双向被動光纖網路傳輸系統」，相較於傳統的單向
光纖網路傳輸系統而言，「双向」不但可以減少所需的光纖蕊數，且可以使傳輸
容量達到倍增之效果。在相對應的兩個傳送/接收端採用双向傳輸架構，則彼此
之間只需一蕊的光纖專線即可滿足需求。當然，双向双傳輸系統也有其存在必
須克服的缺點。就傳輸品質「失真」而言，系統存在著「線性失真」與「非線
性失真」兩大類，尤其當傳輸系統為双向傳輸系統時，因為上、下行 
(Up-Stream/Down-Stream) 信號彼此之間的互相干擾，使得上述兩大類失真的存
在顯得更加明顯，這是系統設計者所必須加以克服的問題。就「線性失真」而
言，它代表在接收端光信號彼此之間的干擾，舉例來說在頻道 1 可能會收到頻
道 2 的光信號，或者是頻道 2 可能會接收到頻道 1 或頻道 3 的光信號 [21]-[23]。
為了能夠有效的抑制線性失真，在光接收端必須挑選相鄰頻道隔離度值 
(Isolation) >40 dB 的分波多工解多工器 (DeMultiplexer)，唯有採用規格嚴謹的
解多工器，才可以有效的抑制因相鄰頻道干擾所引起的線性失真。系統設計者
若想設計出ㄧ個低線性失真的双向傳輸光纖網路系統，必須明確規範出最小
(minimum) 解多工器相鄰頻道隔離度值，並且對於信號的失真需採取更完善的
補償機制。  
另外就系統性能改善方面我們提出補償機制： 
(1) 外部光源注入技術被拿來應用於傳輸系統中用以改善傳輸信號品質。當注入光
源 (master) 與被注入之雷射 (slave) 之間頻率 (波長) 的差異只有一點點
時，此時就會產生所謂的注入行為。實驗結果驗證當有外部光源注入時，雷射
二極體頻率響應將會增加且降低臨界電流，進而以改善系統傳輸信號品質。 
(2) 針對基頻數位信號 (OC-48/2.5 Gbps，HDTV/1.49 Gbps，Gigabit Ethernet/1 Gbps) 
而言，在數位光接收機後加入快速資料比較器 (Date Comparator) [24]，其目的
是將經過光電轉換後的高速數位信號與原先所儲存的複製數位信號作快速比
較，在最短時間內去除因系統傳輸所引起的時閃 (Jitter) 以辨認出所接收到的
 5
（三）研究方法 
圖一為我們所提出的建構於 FP 雷射二極体與注入鎖模技術的『雙向
HDTV/Gigabit Ethernet 分波多工被動光網路傳輸系統』。此一雙向
HDTV/Gigabit Ethernet 系統兩端發射端主要是由 2 部 HDTV 信號產生器、
2 部 Gigabit Ethernet 信號產生器、4 顆 FP 雷射二極体、及 4 個光循環器 
(OCs；Optical Circulators) 所組合而成。FP1 與 FP3 雷射二極体採用直接調
變方式調變 77 個 HDTV 電視頻道、具有 1.49 Gb/s 的傳輸速率 (CH2-78；
19.39 Mbps/channel × 77 channels)。而 FP2 與 FP4 雷射也同樣是採用直接調
變方式，調變 Gigabit Ethernet 頻道、具有 1 Gb/s 的傳輸速率。再則；隨
選視訊 (VOD；Video-on-Demand) 服務在此一分波多工被動光網路架構中
能夠利用 Gigabit Ethernet 雙向互動來完成。為了防止 FP 雷射因為溫度的
變動而產生波長漂移，必須設計散熱器在直接調變的 FP 雷射光發射機上。
至於外部光源注入部分，預計使用兩部寬頻的 ASE 光源來當作注入光源。
ASE 寬頻光源預計由 2 級的 EDFA 所組成，內建 2 個反向的光隔離器用以
阻擋從輸入及輸出端的反射。第一部寬頻 ASE 光源藉由 1 個光分離器 
(Optical Splitter) 與 2 個 3 dB 頻寬約為 0.6 nm 的光帶通濾波器有效的分割
為λ1 (1535.98 nm) 與λ2 (1538.38 nm) 2 個光通道。另一個寬頻 ASE 光源
也同樣藉由 1 個光分離器、與 2 個 3 dB 頻寬約為 0.6 nm 的光帶通濾波器
有效的分割為λ3 (1540.78 nm) 與λ4 (1543.18 nm) 2 個光通道。對於圖五左
側的光發射機λ1 與λ2 分別被注入至 FP1 與 FP2 雷射二極体，對於右側的
光發射機λ3 與λ4 則分別被注入至 FP3 與 FP4 雷射二極体；光注入是經由
1 個 3 埠的光循環器來完成。對於λ1 注入至 FP1 雷射，λ1被耦合進入光
循環器的第 1 埠，注入鎖模的 FP 雷射光源被耦合進入光循環器的第 2 埠，
光循環器的第 3 埠輸出則經由一個光結合器 / 分離器  (Optical 
Combiner/Splitter) 注入至光纖。之所以考慮使用 3 埠的光循環器，是因為
其具有優良的光特性：包括低的插入損失 (0.8 dB)、高的阻隔率 (>40 dB)、
 7
當注入之雷射光源其頻率比被注入之 FP 雷射二極體稍低時，此時我們
發現對於 FP 雷射二極體而言就會有注入鎖模的情況發生。FP 雷射二極體
產生注入鎖模狀況時，它的光譜特性會稍微的往長波長方向移動，並且雷
射線寬會稍微變窄。一般而言，最佳注入鎖模條件發生於 msater 跟 slave
雷射波長差距介於 0.12~0.15 nm 之間，不過最佳值還是有賴於實驗上的驗
證。當產生最佳鎖模注入時，FP 雷射二極體多縱模態中之一模態將會特別
突出，且其它的模態會產生被抑制的效果，使 FP 雷射二極體光譜特性猶如
DFB 雷射二極體光譜特性。 
MPN (Mode Partition Noise) 對於 FP 雷射二極體而言是一大隱憂。假
設雷射二極體有兩根縱模，這兩根縱模的強度雜訊 (Intensity Noise) 可以
表示為： 
( )φ+= wtAn p cos1             (1) 
( )φ+−= wtAn p cos2              (2) 
其中 A為雜訊振幅、w為雜訊頻率、φ為任意相位。在理想情況下此兩個
強度雜訊總和應為零；但實際上因為有光纖色散延遲 (延遲時間為τ ) 之
故，方程式(1)及(2)將分別變成： 
⎟⎠
⎞⎜⎝
⎛ ++= φτ )
2
(1 twcosAnp        (3) 
⎟⎠
⎞⎜⎝
⎛ +−= φτ )
2
-(2 twcosAnp       (4) 
將(3)及(4)兩式相加 
( )φτ +⎟⎠
⎞⎜⎝
⎛=+ wtwAnn pp sin2sin221       
( )φτ +≅ wtAw sin       (5)  
方程式(5)的結果即是 MPN，從方程式(5)中可以知道 MPN 正比於色散值 
τ ，當色散效應越明顯時，則 MPN 值就越大。很不幸的 FP 雷射二極體因
多縱模之故所以光纖色散效應非常明顯，造成其 MPN 值相當的大。所以
 9
能免除因相鄰頻道所引起的線性 crosstalk，進一步避免 BER 值劣化的現象。 
ASE 雖是一種雜訊源，但其光譜輸出特性在某一特定波長範圍內卻是
相當的平坦，若能好好的應用這種自然特性，實際上卻是提供了價格低廉
的光源。ASE 雜訊源主要由兩部份組成：相同光頻率元件之間拍差 (Beat) 
所引起的直流 (DC) 項，及不同光頻率元件之間拍差所引起的交流 (AC) 
項。所以若將 ASE 雜訊源應用於高密度分波多工系統中作為寬頻光源時，
我們可以將直流成份 I2ASE項視為載波，而將隨時間變化而產生擾動的 I2sp-sp 
拍差項視為雜訊 (Spontaneous-Spontaneous Beat Noise)，則可以得到系統的
訊號雜訊比值 (SNR)：

受嚴重影響。

Abstract—A directly modulated ﬁber-to-the-home (FTTH) inte-
gration with digital link on microwave subcarrier (DLOMS) trans-
port system based on −1 side mode injection-locked and optoelec-
tronic feedback techniques is proposed and demonstrated. Directly
modulated baseband (BB) (622Mbps) and radio frequency (RF)
(622Mbps/10GHz) signals are successfully transmitted simultaneously
over an 80-km standard single-mode ﬁber (SMF) transmission. Low
bit error rate (BER) values and clear eye diagrams were achieved in
our proposed systems. This demonstrated FTTH/DLOMS transport
system is a promising candidate for broadband access networks.
1. INTRODUCTION
The landscape of communications is now undergoing a large change.
Over the last decade the world has seen a great transformation in
communications. It is well known that there are various technology
options for broadband access networks providing high-speed internet
access and triple-play services including data, voice, and video. It is
in general agreed that ﬁber-to-the-home (FTTH) and digital link on
microwave subcarrier (DLOMS) provide the ultimate in bandwidth and
ﬂexibility in upgrades when considering really high-speed broadband
access, especially with data rate of 100Mbps to 1.25Gbps [1–4].
FTTH integrating with DLOMS transport systems have provided a
way to transmit baseband (BB) and radio frequency (RF) signals
simultaneously. Nevertheless, the overall transmission performances
of FTTH/DLOMS transport systems are limited by the problem

pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) generator, one microwave
signal generator, two DFB LDs, one optical circulator (OC), and one
broadband pin photodiode (PD). The central wavelengths of these two
DFB LDs are 1548.25 nm (λ1) and 1549.44 nm (λ2), respectively. The
622Mbps data signal was mixed with a 10GHz microwave carrier
to generate the data stream. A data signal of 1.25Gbps, with a
PRBS length of 215 − 1, was combined with a RF data stream
of 622Mbps/10GHz. The combined signals were used to directly
modulate the DFB LD1.
The optical output of DFB LD1 was injected into the DFB LD2
via the OC, with an injection power level of −5 dBm. The wavelength
of the injected light has been carefully chosen to match with the −1
side mode of slave laser (λ−1) and ensure that the optical enhancement
in side mode suppression ratio (SMSR) is achieved. The OC placed
between the DFB LD1 and the DFB LD2 prevents the returned laser
light to ensure the injection light has totally injected into the DFB
LD2. The output of DFB LD1 was coupled into the port 1 of OC, the
injection-locked DFB LD2 was coupled into the port 2 of OC1, and the
port 3 of OC was separated oﬀ by a 1× 2 optical splitter. Part of the
laser output was used for feedback through an optoelectronic feedback
loop. The other part of the laser output was used for optical signal
transmission. In the optoelectronic feedback loop, ﬁber span between

(ωf ree is the frequency of free-running slave laser, ωinj is the frequency
of master laser). Δω is positive as the frequency of free-running
slave laser is higher than that of master one. When the LD is
modulated by the signal containing frequency components close to
the relaxation oscillation frequency, the LD experiences nonlinear
coupling between carriers and photons. This nonlinear coupling
produces nonlinear distortion, resulting in transmission performance
degradation. Nonlinear distortion can be very small as ΔωR increases
largely. The use of −1 side mode injection locking scheme increases the
laser resonance frequency, leading to an improvement of transmission
performance.

For −1 side mode injection-locked (λ−1, 1548.25 nm) of DFB LD2,
as shown in Figure 2, the SMSR value is larger than 50 dB. The SMSR
is found to be [11]:

where vg is the group velocity; ginj(N) and gnoinj(N) are the gain
for the injected mode and the next strongest mode; τp is the photon
lifetime; βsp is the spontaneous emission factor, B is the recombination
coeﬃcient; N is the carrier density; and Rinj is the injection ratio. −1
side mode injection locking is achieved eﬀectively due to the fact that
the SMSR value increases. The wavelength of the injected light must

where m is the optical modulation index; FR(f1) is the small-signal
frequency response; f1 is the modulation frequency; S0 is the photon
density; and ε is the gain compression parameter with respect to
photon density. Both HD2/C and HD3/C values are decreased as f0 is
increased. The use of −1 side mode injection-locked and optoelectronic
feedback techniques enhance laser resonance frequency, causing system
with lower HD2/C and HD3/C, ﬁnally leading to an improvement of
transmission performance.
The measured and simulated BER curves for FTTH and DLOMS
applications as a function of the received optical power level for free
running, with −5 dBm −1 side mode injection, as well as with −5 dBm
−1 side mode injection and optoelectronic feedback are plotted in
Figures 3(a) and (b), respectively. Free-running here refers to that
the DFB LD1 is transmitted directly without the use of DFB LD2.
The combined BB and RF signals are employed to modulate the
DFB LD1 directly. As to measured results for 1.25Gbps data signal
at a BER of 10−9, in the free-running case, the received optical
power level is −26 dBm; with −5 dBm −1 side mode injection, the
received optical power level is −31.9 dBm; with −5 dBm −1 side mode
injection and optoelectronic feedback, the received optical power is
−34.2 dBm. There is a power penalty of ∼8 dB for the free-running
case when compared to the −1 side mode injection and optoelectronic
feedback. As to measured results for 622Mbps/10GHz data stream
at a BER of 10−9, in the free-running case, the received optical
power level is −27.4 dBm; with −5 dBm −1 side mode injection,
the received optical power level is −33.4 dBm; with −5 dBm −1 side
mode injection and optoelectronic feedback, the received optical power
level is −35.8 dBm. Compared to the free-running case, 8.4 dB of
the received optical power reduction is achieved as light injection
and optoelectronic feedback techniques are simultaneously to reduce
the degradation factor of signal fading because of ﬁber dispersion.
Signal fading occurs due to the interaction between the propagating
signal in the ﬁber and the dispersion. The use of −1 side mode
injection and optoelectronic feedback techniques not only reduces
the dispersion in the transmission ﬁber but also overcomes system
limitations imposed by optical double sideband generation at the
optical transmitter, leading to BER performance improvement. From
Figures 3(a) and (b), it can also be seen that the simulated results
match the measured (experimental) results, i.e., these simulated results
conﬁrm the accuracy of the experimental results.
Most injection-locking experiments involving data transmission
have the slave laser (DFB LD2) modulated. In this experiment,
however, the master laser (DFB LD1) is modulated. It has been

previously predicted that in such a conﬁguration, there should be
a signiﬁcant attenuation of the data [13]. In this experiment, with
−1 side mode injection only, the modulation suppression is 28 dB.
However, with simultaneous −1 side mode injection and optoelectronic
feedback techniques, the modulation suppression is decreased to 10 dB,
i.e., systems’ transmission performance aﬀected by low modulation
suppression value is limited. −1 side mode injection and optoelectronic
feedback techniques cause carrier re-injection, thereby increase the
laser resonance frequency and lead to the reduction of threshold
current, as well as result in higher optical power launched into the ﬁber.
The higher optical power we get, the lower modulation suppression we
obtain. −1 side mode injection and optoelectronic feedback techniques
are used as compensation schemes to compensate for the modulation
suppression. If DFB LD1 is used alone to transmit signals over ﬁber
link, then the modulation suppression can be avoided. It seems to be
more advantageous to simply transmit DFB LD1 directly. However,
it is worth using −1 side mode injection and optoelectronic feedback

where vg is the group velocity, ginj(N) and gnoinj(N) are the gain
for the injected mode and the next strongest mode, τp is the
photon lifetime, βsp is the spontaneous emission factor, B is the
recombination coeﬃcient, N is the carrier density, and Rinj is the
injection ratio. It is clear that the SMSR will increase as the in-
jection ratio Rinj increases. Injection locking is achieved effectively
due to the fact that the SMSR value increases. The wavelengths
of the injected light must be carefully chosen to match with four
modes (main mode and three negative side modes) of DFB LD
and ensure that the optical enhancement in SMSR is achieved. As
the optimal injection locking happens, DFB LD has the best opti-
cal characteristic in terms of the highest SMSR value at different
modes. Wavelength stabilization is important and critical for main
and side modes injection-locked DFB LD. To study the injection
locking behavior, λ0, λ−1, λ−2 and λ−3 wavelengths are tuned rel-
ative to four modes of DFB LD by using temperature controllers.
It is important to control the temperature of the injected light; if
without temperature controller, SMSR degradation takes place due
to wavelength mismatch with modes of DFB LD, in which resulting
in transmission performance deterioration.
To build a full-duplex ROF transport system with high linearity
and SMSR value requirements, we should reluctantly choose LDs
which operate in single longitudinal mode. Many schemes, such as
the use of DFB LDs, have been proposed to obtain the single longi-
tudinal mode operation. However, multiple DFB LDs are expensive
optical sources for full-duplex ROF transport systems. Moreover, it
is diﬃcult to obtain high SMSR value (>50 dB) for DFB LD. As one
DFB laser diode with main and side modes injection-locked and
each mode has a SMSR value larger than 50 dB, such a scheme can
be used as optical sources with excellent optical characteristic in
full-duplex ROF transport systems.

slave laser is frequency-locked to the master laser, and the slave
lasing power is locked to the master laser. If not within the lock-
ing range, slave laser has chaotic optical output [10], leading to
mode shift and competition. The optimal injection locking condi-
tion of main mode is found as the detuning between λ0 and λ is

Abstract—A split-band directly modulated fiber optical CATV sys-
tem employing −1 side-mode injection-locked and semiconductor op-
tical amplifier (SOA)-based optical single sideband (SSB) modulation
techniques is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. For our pro-
posed systems, it is relatively simple to implement as only one SOA
is required. Excellent performances of carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR),
composite second order (CSO), and composite triple beat (CTB) were
achieved over a 100-km single-mode fiber (SMF) transmission.
1. INTRODUCTION
Distributed feedback laser diode (DFB LD) with direct modulation
can be employed for transmitting CATV signals at very low cost, in
which comparing to externally modulated fiber optical CATV systems.
However, nonlinear distortions are occurred greatly when DFB LD
is directly modulated with analog signals; and these distortions
will cause severe system performance degradations. To reduce
distortions generated from directly modulated systems, Meng et al.
have reported they can be suppressed with main mode optical injection
locking [1]. In addition, side-mode injection-locked technique for
greater distortions suppression has been proposed [2, 3]. And further,
low fiber dispersion is necessary for analog optical links to get good
transmission performances. Optical single sideband (SSB) modulation
technique is an effective approach to overcome the fiber dispersion
since the optical linewidth is reduced by a factor of two. Several
approaches have been proposed to generate optical SSB signal. But,
sophisticated sideband filtering technique [4]; as well as expensive dual
electrode Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) and phase modulator [5, 6]

two directly modulated DFB LDs with an optical modulation index
(OMI) of ∼ 3.6% per channel. Large OMI results in better CNR
performance, but degrades the CSO/CTB performance. In order to
satisfy the CATV requirements, the OMI value needs to be set at an
optimum value. Channels 2–40 are directly fed into DFB LD1 (λ1,
1532.96 nm), and channels 41–78 are directly fed into DFB LD3 (λ3,
1535.36 nm). The optical output of the DFB LD2 (λ2, 1531.72 nm)
was injected into the DFB LD1 via the optical circulator1 (OC1), with
an injection power level of −3 dBm. Meanwhile, the optical output of
the DFB LD4 (λ4, 1534.12 nm) was injected into the DFB LD3 via the
OC2, with an injection power level of −3 dBm. The optical powers of
injection-locked LD1 and LD3 were coupled into the SOA by a 2 × 1
optical combiner to generate optical SSB signals. The optical signals
are transmitted through three SMF spans (20 + 40 + 40 km) with the
help of one SOA and two erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs). We
place a variable optical attenuator (VOA) at the start of each optical
link so that the optical power launched into the fiber is lower. Over
a 100-km SMF transmission, the received optical signals were split by
a 1 × 2 optical splitter, went through two separate optical band-pass
filters (OBPFs) to select the appropriate wavelength, detected using
two optical receivers, passed through two separate RF BPFs (50–330
and 320–550MHz) to remove the spurious, and recombined the RF
signals using a 2 × 1 RF combiner. CNR, CSO and CTB values were
measured using an HP-8591C CATV analyzer over a 100-km SMF
transmission.
3. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
The resonance frequency f0 in an injection-locked laser can be stated
as [7]
f0 ≈ 12pi
(

− f
2FI
4F a
)1/2
(1)
where Fa and FI are the average photon densities of the mode a
and of the injected light, Ga is the modal gain of the mode a,
Ga,n = dGa/dn, and f is the intermodal spacing in the frequency
domain. f0 is enhanced with injection into negative mode greatly, it
means that −1 side-mode injection-locked technique results in systems’
performance improvement significantly. One key feature of injection
locking is that the injected laser (slave laser) is forced to oscillate at
the injection frequency. Therefore, the frequency component at the
injection frequency becomes dominant. The injection locking behavior
happens when an injection laser (master laser) is slightly detuned to

OSA at the SOA output. The optical SSB signals are obtained as
the SOA input optical powers are −5 and −8 dBm per wavelength,
respectively. When the optical DSB signal was coupled into the SOA
at the input power of −5 ∼ −8 dBm per wavelength, there was a large
change in the optical signals at the SOA output. The amplitude of
the optical sideband at the right-hand side of the optical carrier was
not changed, but the amplitude of the optical sideband at the left-
hand side of the optical carrier was suppressed, i.e., the optical SSB
signal was created. In this proposed systems, optical SSB signal was
created and transmitted as the SOA input optical power was −5 dBm
per wavelength (λ2 and λ4).
Considering both self-phase modulation and self-gain modulation
in the SOA, the electrical field of the output signal in an SOA can be
expressed as
E(t)=E0
[
1+
m
2
sin(ωmt)
]
·exp
[
iω0t+(1+iα)
m
2
ηPeff sin(ωmt+β)
]
(2)
where E0 is the output carrier amplitude, m is the input signal
modulation index, ωm is the subcarrier frequency, ω0 is the optical
carrier frequency, α is the linewidth enhancement factor, η is a
coefficient that depends on the gain feature of the SOA, Peff is the
effective input optical power, and β is the phase difference between
the change of carrier density and the change of input optical power.
Expanding Equation (2) in Bessel series and neglecting high-order
terms, the complex envelopes for the frequencies ω0 + ωm (upper
sideband) and ω0 − ωm (lower sideband) can be estimated as:
Eω0±ωm ≈ ∓ im
4
E0J0(χ) · {1 + ρ exp[j(θ ± β)]} (3)
where θ = tan−1 α, ρ = ηPeff (1 + α2)1/2, and χ =
−imρ exp(iθ)
2 .
Then sideband suppression ratio (SSR) can be derived:
SSR =
∣∣∣∣Eω0−ωmEω0+ωm
∣∣∣∣2 ≈ ∣∣∣∣ 1 + ρ exp[j(θ − β)]1− ρ exp[j(θ + β − pi)
∣∣∣∣2 (4)
ρ is adjustable as a function of input optical power. Thereby, as
ρ cos(θ + β − pi) = 1 (5)
The maximum SSR can be obtained.
Figure 3(a) shows the measured CNR values under NTSC channel
number for free-running, with −3 dBm −1 side-mode injection and
optical DSB-modulated, as well as with−3 dBm−1 side mode injection
and SOA-based optical SSB-modulated, respectively. It can be seen
that the CNR value is increased as −3 dBm optical power is injected
into the slave laser. The CNR value depends critically on the optical

4. CONCLUSION
We proposed and experimentally demonstrated a split-band directly
modulated fiber optical CATV system employing −1 side-mode
injection-locked and SOA-based optical SSB modulation techniques.
Our proposed scheme is relatively easy to implement, as only one
SOA is required. Excellent performances of CNR, CSO and CTB were
achieved over a 100-km SMF transmission.

such as signal fading due to ﬁber dispersion [5]. Thereby, it is
necessary to take some ways to overcome signal fading problem
and reduce ﬁber dispersion when transmitting BB and RF signals
simultaneously. The feasibility of employing one Fabry-Perot laser
diode (FP LD) with two modes injection-locked to transmit BB and
RF signals simultaneously was demonstrated previously [6]. However,
the architecture of systems can be further simpliﬁed by combining
BB and RF signals in electrical domain ﬁrst and direct modulating
distributed feedback (DFB) LD. In addition, the system performance
can be further improved by using −1 side mode injection-locked
and optoelectronic feedback techniques [7]. In this paper, a directly
modulated FTTH/DLOMS transport system based on −1 side mode
injection-locked and optoelectronic feedback techniques is proposed
and demonstrated. In previous studies [8, 9], DFB LD with light
injection and optoelectronic feedback techniques has been proposed
in analog CATV/radio-over-ﬁber (ROF) transport systems to enhance
the transmission performance of systems. However, DFB LD with
light injection and optoelectronic feedback techniques in practical
implementation of directly modulated FTTH/DLOMS transport
systems has not been proposed. To the best of our knowledge, it is the
ﬁrst time to transmit digital and analog signals simultaneously over an
−80 km standard single-mode ﬁber (SMF) transmission based on DFB
LD with −1 side mode injection-locked and optoelectronic feedback
techniques. For a successful deployment of FTTH/DLOMS transport
systems, it is necessary to develop a cost-eﬀective architecture. DFB
LD with −1 side mode injection-locked and optoelectronic feedback
techniques is a feasible scheme in which injection-locked −1 side mode
is used to transmit BB and RF signals. This is an attractive scheme
because it avoids the need of expensive and sophisticated dual-parallel
modulator with carrier suppression scheme [10]. Thereby, it reveals
a prominent one with more economic advantage. Directly modulated
BB (1.25Gbps) and RF (622Mbps/10GHz) signals are successfully
transmitted simultaneously. Low bit error rate (BER) values and clear
eye diagrams were achieved in our proposed FTTH integration with
DLOMS transport systems.
2. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
Figure 1 shows the experimental conﬁguration of our proposed directly
modulated FTTH/DLOMS transport systems based on −1 side mode
injection-locked and optoelectronic feedback techniques. The solid
line represents the optical signal path, and the dash line represents
the electrical signal one. The transmitting site is composed of one
128 Lu et al.
the OC and broadband PD is a ﬁber patchcord. The broadband
PD converts laser light into BB and RF combined signals to directly
modulate the DFB LD2. The optical power was ampliﬁed by two
stages of erbium-doped ﬁber ampliﬁers (EDFAs), system link with a
transmission length of 80 km consisted of two SMF spans (40+40 km).
A variable optical attenuator (VOA) was placed at the start of each
optical link, thus there would be a reduction in distortions. Over
an 80-km SMF transmission, the received optical signal was detected
by a broadband PD, separated oﬀ by a 1 × 2 RF splitter, and
went through 2 separate RF low-pass ﬁlter (LPF) and band-pass
ﬁlters (BPF) (1.5GHz/LPF and 10GHz/BPF). The 1.25Gbps data
signal was directly fed into a BER tester for BER analysis, and the
622Mbps/10GHz data stream was demodulated and fed into a BER
tester for BER analysis.
3. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The resonance frequency f0 in an injection-locked LD can be expressed
as [9]
f0 ≈ 12π
(
FaGaGa, n
Γ
− f
2FI
4Fa
)1/2
(1)
where Fa and FI are the average photon densities of the mode a and
injected light, Ga is the modal gain of mode a; Ga, n = dGa/dn, f is the
intermodal spacing in the frequency domain; and Γ is the conﬁnement
factor. f0 is enhanced with injection into negative side mode, thereby,
the laser resonance frequency under −1 side mode injection-locked is
larger than that under main mode injection-locked. And further, the
resonance frequency enhancement term ΔωR can be stated as [10]:
ΔωR = −α2 g[N0 −Nth] + Δω (2)
where g is the gain coeﬃcient; N0 is the steady-state carrier number;
and Nth is the threshold carrier number. It is clear from Eq. (2) that
the two terms on the right-hand side allow injection-locked laser to
signiﬁcantly enhance the bandwidth. The ﬁrst term on the right-
hand side accounts for the shifting of the slave cavity mode from its
free-running frequency by α parameter. As the steady-state carrier
number can only be less than the threshold, the ﬁrst term is positive.
The primary enhancement comes from the second term Δω. An
optimum locking can be achieved if the frequency of the master laser
is lower than the free-running slave laser frequency, i.e., negative
detuning. The detuning frequency is deﬁned as Δω ≡ ωf ree − ωinj

relaxation oscillation damping rate Γf can be derived from the above
rate equations. The optoelectronic feedback increases the stability of
the laser diode when Γf > Γ0 (damping rate as laser diode only with
light injection), resulting in out-of-phase carrier re-injection. The laser
resonance frequency f0 can be stated as

increases the photon density, in which resulting in an improvement

techniques because the performances of slave laser (DFB LD2) can be
improved with not only enhanced bandwidth and SMSR value, but also
lower threshold current and frequency chirp. All of these will lead to
superior transmission performance. Our proposal reveals a prominent
one compared with that of systems with single DFB LD.

Amplitude and jitter ﬂuctuations in the signals are clearly observed in
both free-running cases (Figures 4(a) and (c)) due to ﬁber dispersion.
Signal distortion will give an increase in power penalty. However,
in both −1 side mode injection and optoelectronic feedback cases
(Figures 4(b) and (d)), amplitude and jitter ﬂuctuations in the signals
are clearly reduced.
4. CONCLUSION
We proposed and demonstrated a directly modulated FTTH/DLOMS
transport system based on −1 side mode injection-locked and
optoelectronic feedback techniques. Simultaneous transmission of BB
and RF signals in a directly modulated form, low BER values and clear
eye diagrams were achieved in our proposed systems. Such a proposed
FTTH/DLOMS transport system will beneﬁt the deployment of the
broadband access networks.

A full duplex radio-on-ﬁber (ROF) transport system based on main and multiple side modes injection-
locked distributed feedback laser diode (DFB LD) is proposed and experimentally investigated. DFB LD
is successfully injection-locked not only in the main mode but also in other side modes. A data signal
of 70 Mbps/10 GHz (WiMAX) signal is transmitted over long-haul single-mode ﬁber (SMF) transmission.
Good bit error rate (BER) performances were achieved for both down-link and up-link transmissions in
our proposed full-duplex ROF transport systems.

1. Introduction
To meet the accelerating demands in communication systems,
the integration of optical network and wireless radio is a promising
solution. Radio-on-ﬁber (ROF) transport systems have the potential
to offer large transmission capacity, signiﬁcant mobility and ﬂexi-
bility, as well as economic advantage due to its broad bandwidth
and low attenuation characteristics [1–3]. ROF transport systems
allow ﬂexible network design by linking central station (CS) to re-
motely located base stations (BSs) using optical ﬁber. In ROF trans-
port systems, injection-locked laser diode (LD) exhibits enhanced
modulation bandwidth, side mode suppression ratio (SMSR), chirp
reduction, and nonlinear distortion reduction [4–6]. The advan-
tages achieved by injection locking scheme substantially improve
the performance in ROF transport systems. In this paper, an archi-
tecture of full-duplex ROF transport systems based on main and
multiple side modes injection-locked distributed feedback (DFB)
LD is proposed and demonstrated. A data signal of 70 Mbps/10 GHz
(WiMAX) is directly modulated and successfully transmitted over
long-haul single-mode ﬁber (SMF) transmission to the remote BSs.
Each BS is addressed by individual wavelength for an optical add–
drop multiplexer (OADM).
Full-duplex ROF transport systems are envisioned to have a
multiple number of DFB LDs should be wavelength-selected for
each channel and controlled to operate at speciﬁc wavelength.
However, this process will increase the cost and complexity of sys-
tems. For a successful implementation of full-duplex ROF transport
systems, it is necessary to develop optical sources with low cost

and low complexity. DFB LD with main and side modes injection-
locked is a feasible scheme in which injection-locked modes are
used to transmit signals. It is attractive because it avoids the
need of multiple DFB LDs with selected wavelengths. Employing
main and side modes injection-locked scheme, DFB LD will be im-
proved with not only enhanced bandwidth and SMSR value, but
also lower frequency chirp and nonlinear distortion. All of these
will lead to superior transmission performance. Our proposal re-
veals a prominent one than that of systems with multiple DFB
LDs. Performances of the proposed systems were investigated for
both up-link and down-link transmissions. Low bit error rate (BER)
value was achieved in our proposed full-duplex ROF transport sys-
tems.
2. Experimental setup
The schematic architecture of our proposed full-duplex ROF
transport systems based on main and multiple side modes injec-
tion-locked DFB LD is shown in Fig. 1. At the CS, WIMAX format
data signal is generated by using 70 Mbps data stream mixed with
10 GHz microwave carrier. The resulting data signal is directly
modulated to a DFB LD, with a central wavelength of 1548.71 nm
(λ), and eﬃciently split into four parts for main and multiple side
modes injection-locked. The relative intensity noise and spectral
linewidth of the DFB LD are −160 dB/Hz and 3 MHz, respectively.
In the free-running, the output power level of DFB LD was 0 dBm,
at a bias current of 30 mA. All four parts of directly modulated
optical signals are coupled into the port 2 of four 3-port optical
circulators (OC1–OC4). Light are injected into the OCs in counter
propagation direction via port 1 of OCs, with an injection power
level of 3 dBm per optical channel. The wavelengths of injected
light are 1548.82 (λ0), 1547.26 (λ−1), 1546.25 (λ−2) and 1545.21

(λ−3) nm, respectively. All optical signals (λ0, λ−1, λ−2 and λ−3)
are coupled by a 4 × 1 optical coupler. To transmit optical sig-
nals over a long-haul ﬁber link, the optical power is ampliﬁed by
erbium-doped ﬁber ampliﬁer (EDFA)-I and fed into the ﬁber back-
bone.
At the CS, the optical signal is generated and then distributed
through standard SMF to the four remote BSs (BS0, BS1, BS2, and
BS3) by using cascaded EDFAs and OADMs. The optical signal is
transmitted through ﬁve SMF spans (40 km × 5) with the help of
ﬁve EDFAs. All the EDFAs have an output power level of ∼17 dBm,
at an input power level of 0 dBm. Each BS is connected to the ﬁber
backbone through an OADM which deals with an individual wave-
length. The appropriate wavelengths are dropped by the OADM in
BSs, as shown in Fig. 2. The OADM, with >40 dB add/drop channel
isolation, consists of one ﬁber Bragg grating (FBG) located between
two OCs (OC5 and OC6). The functions of OADM are to drop the
down-link wavelength to the BS from the ﬁber backbone, and to
add the up-link wavelength to the ﬁber backbone from the BS. The
port 3 of OC5 was separated off by a 1× 2 optical splitter. Part of
the laser was used for down-link transmission, and the other part
of the laser was reused for up-link transmission. The optical signal
is re-modulated by 70 Mbps/10 GHz data signal through a Mach–
Zehnder modulator (MZM), and the MZM is connected with the
port 3 of OC6. Such an architecture is attractive because it enables
BS to share the light source remotely located at the CS. The down-
link data signal is adjusted by a variable optical attenuator (VOA),
and detected by a broadband photodiode (PD) to convert optical
signal into RF one. The 70 Mbps/10 GHz data signal is fed into a
BER tester for BER analysis after demodulation. For up-link trans-
mission, the 70 Mbps/10 GHz data signal is transmitted through
SMF to the CS, passed through an optical tunable band-pass ﬁl-
ter (TBPF) to select the desired wavelength, attenuated by a VOA,
detected by a broadband PD to convert optical signal into RF one,
and provided to a demodulator. For demodulation part, RF and lo-
cal oscillator (10 GHz) signals are applied to a mixer, the output of
the mixer is put through a low-pass ﬁlter (LPF) to obtain the mod-
ulated data stream (70 Mbps). Finally, 70-Mbps data stream is fed
into a BER tester for BER analysis.
3. Experimental results and discussion
The resonance frequency f0 in an injection-locked LD can be
expressed as [7]
f0 ≈ 1
2π
(
FaGaGa,n
Γ
− f
2F I
4Fa
)1/2
, (1)
where Fa and F I are the average photon densities of the mode
a and of the injected light, Ga is the modal gain of the mode a,
Ga,n = dGa/dn, f is the intermodal spacing in the frequency do-
main, and Γ is the transverse-mode-dependent conﬁnement fac-
tor. f0 is enhanced with injection into negative side mode, thereby,
the laser resonance frequency under negative side mode injection-
locked is larger than that under main mode injection-locked. And
further, the resonance frequency enhancement term ωR can be
stated as [4]:
ωR = −α
2
g[N0 − Nth] + ω, (2)
where g is the gain coeﬃcient, N0 is the steady-state carrier num-
ber, and Nth is the threshold carrier number. It is clear from Eq. (2)
that the two terms on the right-hand side allow injection-locked
laser to signiﬁcantly enhance the bandwidth. The ﬁrst term on the
right-hand side accounts for the shifting of the slave cavity mode
from its free-running frequency by α parameter. As the steady-
state carrier number can only be less than the threshold, the ﬁrst
term is positive. The primary enhancement comes from the second
term ω. An optimum locking can be achieved if the frequency
of the master laser is lower than the free-running slave laser fre-
quency, i.e., negative detuning. The detuning frequency is deﬁned
as ω ≡ ωfree − ωinj (ωfree is the frequency of free-running slave
laser, ωinj is the frequency of master laser). ω is positive as
the frequency of free-running slave laser is higher than that of
master one. When the LD is modulated by the signal containing
frequency components close to the relaxation oscillation frequency,
the LD experiences nonlinear coupling between carriers and pho-
tons. This nonlinear coupling produces nonlinear distortion, result-
ing in transmission performance degradation. Nonlinear distortion
can be very small as ωR increases largely. The use of main and
negative side modes injection locking scheme increases the laser
resonance frequency, in which leading to an improvement of trans-
mission performance.
The optical spectrum of the free-running DFB LD is shown in
Fig. 3(a), it can be seen that there are many modes in the free-
running DFB LD. To make it certain that the multi-wavelength
operation is achieved with all four wavelengths at the same time,
λ0, λ−1, λ−2, and λ−3 are combined by a 4×1 optical coupler and
fed into an optical spectrum analyzer. The optical spectrum of DFB
LD locked at λ0, λ−1, λ−2, and λ−3 is present in Fig. 3(b), no effect

optical power penalty improvement of 5.5 dB is obtained, com-
pared to the free-running case, as −1 side mode under injection
locking. For up-link transmission from BS2 to CS (over an 80 km
SMF transport; Fig. 4(d)) and at a BER of 10−9; in the free-running
case (λ), the received optical power level is −3.8 dBm; for −2
side mode injection-locked (λ−2), the received optical power level
was −9.5 dBm. Received optical power penalty improvement of
5.7 dB is obtained, compared to the free-running case, as −2 side
mode under injection locking. Low BER values are achieved for
both down/up-links under side modes injection locking. The use of
main and side modes injection-locking scheme increases the res-
onance frequency of laser, in which leading to an improvement of
BER performance.
Figs. 5(a) and 5(b) display the eye diagrams of down-link
70 Mbps/10 GHz data signal (from CS to BS2) under the condi-
tions of free-running (λ), and −2 side mode injection-locked (λ−2),
respectively. And Fig. 5(c) shows the eye diagram of down-link
70 Mbps data stream (from CS to BS2) after mixer under −2 side
mode injection-locked. The amplitude ﬂuctuation in the signal is
observed in free-running case (Fig. 5(a)). The signal distortion will
give an increase in power penalty. In −2 side mode injection-
locked one (Figs. 5(b) and 5(c)), the amplitude ﬂuctuation in the
signal is reduced.
4. Conclusion
A full-duplex ROF transport system based on main and mul-
tiple side modes injection-locked DFB LD is proposed. We have
experimentally investigated to establish the practicability of our
proposed systems with WIMAX data stream and achieved good
BER performance over a 120 km SMF links for both down/up-
links. The experimental results show that our proposed systems
can be applicable for long-haul full-duplex microwave optical
links.

system employing −1 side-mode injection-locked and semiconductor
optical amplifier (SOA)-based optical SSB modulation techniques is
proposed and experimentally demonstrated. This proposed approach
is relatively simple to implement, as it requires only one SOA.
Additional sophisticated technique or expensive optical devices are
not required. Over a 100-km single-mode fiber (SMF) transmission,
excellent performances of carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR), composite
second order (CSO), and composite triple beat (CTB) were obtained
in our proposed systems.

detuning is employed to achieve an injection locking [8]. As the −1

the power launched into the EDFA is increased. The higher optical
power is launched into the EDFA, the better CNR performance is
obtained in systems. As to the CSO and CTB performances, as
shown in Figures 3(b) and (c), the CSO and CTB values can be
improved significantly by employing −1 side-mode injection-locked
and SOA-based optical SSB-modulated techniques. In the free-
running case, the CSO/CTB values (> 65/62 dB) meet the fiber
optical CATV demands (> 65/60 dB) due to the use of split-band
scheme. With −3 dBm −1 side mode injection and optical DSB-
modulated, CSO/CTB improvements of ∼ 6 dB (> 71/68 dB) have
been achieved. With −3 dBm −1 side-mode injection and SOA-based
optical SSB-modulated, large CSO/CTB improvements of ∼ 7.5 dB
(> 72.6/69.5 dB) have been achieved. The improvements are from to
the use of −1 side mode injection-locked technique to increase the laser
resonance frequency greatly and SOA-based optical SSB modulation
one to overcome the fiber dispersion significantly.
