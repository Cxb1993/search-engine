Abstract
Most current vibration-based chemical sensors and biosensors
measure the sensors resonance frequency change to quantify the
small mass of chemical and biological agents attached to the sur-
face of the sensors. In contrast, this paper proposes a novel tech-
nique for mass detection of a piezoelectric cantilever by actively
triggering bifurcations. The cantilever can be forced to bifurcate
and exhibit complex dynamics (e.g., chaos) by using a nonlinear
feedback excitation. In this work, a feedback loop is constructed
by measuring a voltage from a piezoelectric sensor, processing the
signal, and applying the voltage to a piezoelectric actuator. Due
to the high sensitivity of chaotic dynamics to small parametric
variations, the morphing of the attractor of the dynamics of the
piezoelectric cantilever can be utilized as an indicator to detect a
small amount of mass and its location. The numerical investiga-
tion in this paper provides a basis to develop the next generation
of high sensitivity vibration-based mass detection sensors.

2 Mathematical modeling
In this section, the modeling of the components of the piezoelec-
tric cantilever is discussed. The investigated piezoelectric can-
tilever is shown in ﬁgure 1. The structure is composed of an
aluminum cantilever beam in which two piezoelectric actuators,
such as PZT (lead zirconium titanate) patches, are symmetrically
bonded on its surfaces near the clamp location using an epoxy
adhesive. When a voltage is applied to the PZT patches, based
on the assumption of perfect bonding layer and eﬀectively trans-
ferred shear force, the bimorph conﬁguration generates a moment
at the ends of the patches. The exerted element Ma [17] can be
expressed as
Ma =
EbtbEpatpa
Ebtb + 6Epatpa
Ab
d31aV
tpa
, (1)
where Eb and Epa are the Young’s modulus of the aluminum
beam and the PZT actuators, tb and tpa are the thickness of the
aluminum beam and the PZT actuators, Ab is the cross section
area of the aluminum beam, d31a is the piezoelectric constant
of the PZT actuators, and V is the applied voltage to the PZT
actuators. In addition, piezoelectric sensors (e.g. small and thin
PZT patches) are attached to single or multiple locations along
the cantilever to measure its dynamics. Since the piezoelectric
sensor typically has a very high output impedance, the signal

Diﬀerent from previous research, the key idea of this work is to
actively change qualitatively dynamical behavior of the cantilever
by means of a designed nonlinear feedback loop so that the can-
tilever undergoes bifurcations. The feedback loop can be achieved
by applying the voltage V to the piezoelectric actuator which is
a nonlinear function of the output voltage Vo from the charge
ampliﬁer. One important question addressed herein asks what
combination of nonlinear functions and time-dependent functions
should be used in the feedback circuit in ﬁgure 1 such that a small
mass change along the cantilever can cause signiﬁcant qualitative
changes in the dynamics. The answer is not unique. Here, we use
linear and cubic functions of Vo as well as a sine function in the
circuit. Therefore, the applied voltage V to the piezoelectric ac-
tuator can be represented as
V = G(C1Vo + C2V
3
o + C3 sinωt), (4)
where G is the linear gain used in the voltage ampliﬁer, and C1,
C2, C3, and ω are the controlled parameters that can be tuned
such that the desired bifurcation occurs in the system. Then, the
moment acting on the cantilever due to the feedback loop can be
obtained by substituting (4) to (1) as follows
Ma =
EbtbEpatpad31aAbG
(Ebtb + 6Epatpa)tpa
(C1Vo + C2V
3
o + C3 sinωt), (5)
where Vo is governed by (2).
Next, the equation governing the transverse vibration of the piezo-
electric cantilever due to the moment from the piezoelectric ac-
tuator can be formulated using the principle of virtual displace-
ments. The internal and external virtual work quantities (i.e.
δWE and δWI) without damping are
δWI =
L∫
0
EI(x)v′′(x, t)δv′′(x, t)dx, and

m(x)φi(x)φj(x)dx and
kij =
L∫
0
EI(x)φ′′i (x)φ
′′
j (x)dx.
The elements in the generalized applied force vector f are written
as
fi = Maφ
′
i(xa),
in which Ma is the moment resulting from the actuator, which is
governed by (5), and xa denotes the location where the moment
is exerted. Also, [c] is modeled using a Rayleigh damping matrix,
namely, [c] = α[m] + β[k], where α = 2ξω1ω2/(ω1 + ω2), β =
2ξ/(ω1+ω2), ω1 and ω2 are the ﬁrst and second modal frequencies,
and ξ is the speciﬁed damping ratio. Note that (7) is a system of
nonlinear diﬀerential equations due to Ma including a nonlinear
function of Vo in (5), which is coupled with (2).
3 Mass sensing methodology
In this section, the way in which mass is sensed, using a nonlinear
feedback excitation to trigger bifurcations, is explained.
In order to theoretically demonstrate the idea of actively trigger-
ing bifurcations by manipulating the control parameters in the
feedback circuit (as shown in (4)) for sensing mass, only the one
generalized coordinate y1(t) and its trial function φ1(x) are con-
sidered here for clarity. Therefore, the governing equation of such
a single degree-of-freedom system is expressed as
m∗y¨1 + c∗y˙1 + k∗y1 = Maφ′1(xa), (8)
where m∗ =
∫L
0 m(x)φ

∗ =
∫L

∗ = 2ξ

m∗k∗,
and Ma is expressed in (5). In fact, (8) is coupled with (2), which

ing the values of the controlled parameter in the feedback loop.
The speciﬁc value of the parameter at which a bifurcation occurs
is known as a bifurcation point. The changes in the bifurcation
point may be related to changes in system parameters such as
mass. For simplicity, a Hopf bifurcation is ﬁrst considered. When
the system undergoes a Hopf bifurcation, one pair of complex
conjugate eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix at the origin pass
through the imaginary axis from the left half-plane to the right
half-plane. Thus, the ﬁxed point at the origin loses its stabil-
ity, and a small-amplitude limit cycle oscillation emerges close to
the former steady state (the origin). To analytically demonstrate
the relationship between a bifurcation point and system param-
eters, the characteristics polynomial of the Jacobian matrix at
the origin is investigated for the system characterized by (9) and
expressed as
∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣
0− λ 1 0
−k∗/m∗ −c∗/m∗ − λ α/m∗
0 −η −1/(RfCf)− λ
∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣
= 0, (10)
where α is the controlled parameter in the feedback circuit, and
m∗, c∗, k∗, Rf , Cf , and η are the system parameters. For the Hopf
bifurcation, λ is substituted with ±ωj into (10) (where j = √−1,
and ω is real and positive). The resulting equations (correspond-
ing to the real and imaginary parts) need to be solved simultane-
ously to obtain the exact expression of the bifurcation point αb
as
αb =
1
η

 m
∗k∗
m∗ + c∗RfCf
− c
∗
RfCf
− k∗

 . (11)
Therefore, the controlled parameter C1 used in (4) for causing a
Hopf bifurcation can be expressed as
9
Finally, in addition to the autonomous feedback, a time-dependent
force (such as a harmonic force) is added in the nonlinear feed-
back circuit. Also, more than one of the generalized coordinates is
considered, and thus, the piezoelectric cantilever is modeled as a
multiple degree-of-freedom system. Therefore, the resulting sys-
tem is more complicated. Due to the explicit time-dependence of
the excitation, the system exhibits more complex dynamics (such
as limit cycles and chaos) when the controlled parameters in the
feedback circuit are varied. In comparison with a Hopf bifurcation
that can be analytically predicted by exploring the eigenvalues
of the Jacobian matrix at the origin, investigating complex bifur-
cations in dynamics of the nonautonomous nonlinear system due
to the controlled parametric variation relies primarily on numer-
ical analysis. The creation of a bifurcation diagram is a common
way to keep track of the bifurcations in the system. To generate
this diagram, ﬁrst, choose a value of the controlled parameter of
interest in the feedback circuit. Next, integrate (7) starting from
some random initial condition over a period of time that allows
the system to settle down to its eventual behavior. Once the tran-
sients have decayed, plot all the local maxima on the attractor for
the particular value of the controlled parameter of interest. Then
move to an adjacent value of the same parameter while keep-
ing other controlled parameters constant, and repeat the same
process for all values of the controlled parameter of interest.
In this study, the controlled parameter C1 in (4) is varied, and
the controlled parameters C2, C3, and ω are kept constant. The
reason for varying C1 is that the linear term in the feedback cir-
cuit is designed to destabilize the system such that bifurcations
occur. The other controlled parameters which are ﬁxed are chosen
based on the following rules. The parameter C2 associated with
the cubic term is set to stabilize the system, determine the ampli-
tude of post-bifurcation dynamics of the cantilever, and enhance
nonlinearity. The controlled parameters C3 and ω are chosen to
provide a harmonic force which injects persistent energy into the
system. Thus, the parameters C2 and C3 are selected such that

locations.
To computationally explore the dynamics of the piezoelectric
cantilever subjected to the nonlinear feedback excitation, the
Rayleigh-Ritz method is used to obtain a set of nonlinear diﬀer-
ential equations. The choice and the number of the trial functions
used in the Rayleigh Ritz method play an important role in the
solvability of the resulting diﬀerential equations. Here, the form
of the trial functions is chosen as φj(x) = 1−cos((2j−1)πx/(2l)),
where l is equal to the length of the cantilever. Also, the ﬁrst ﬁve
modes (i.e. j = 1, . . . , 5) are used enough to obtain satisﬁed con-
vergence. The resulting system of nonlinear diﬀerential equations
including (2), (5), and (7) can be solved numerically using any
time marching scheme. In this work, the Gear method, which
deals with stiﬀ problems, was used.
In this work, the location of the PZT actuator is ﬁxed as shown
in ﬁgure 1, and the PZT sensor is put at three diﬀerent locations
including xs = 0.09m, xs = 0.13m, and xs = 0.25m. Therefore,
there are three diﬀerent piezoelectric cantilevers numerically in-
vestigated. To generate bifurcation diagrams of these cantilevers

displacement and the velocity at x = 0.28m for the cantilever with the sensor at
xs = 0.13m in the cases of no added mass and a 10mg mass added at diﬀerent
locations.
Figure 5 shows the subspace projection of a Poincare´ section of
attractors for the cantilever with the sensor at xs = 0.13m in the
same cases, while the controlled parameters C1, C2, C3, and ω are
600, −10, 1, and 151 rad/sec. Figure 6 shows the subspace pro-
jection of a Poincare´ section of attractors for the cantilever with
the sensor at xs = 0.25m in the same cases, while the controlled
parameters C1, C2, C3, and ω are 510, −1, 1, and 143 rad/sec.
Figures 4-6 show the morphing of the attractor of the dynamics
of the cantilevers subjected to the speciﬁed feedback excitations
due to diﬀerent parametric variations caused by a mass added to
diﬀerent locations. Figure 5 shows that the closed loops, which
represent limit cycle oscillations, in each subplot are similar to
each other. This means that the limit cycle oscillations are not
sensitive to a small variation of mass, no matter where the small
mass is added. In contrast, ﬁgure 4 and ﬁgure 6 show two diﬀerent
chaotic attractors that exhibit two clouds of points with diﬀerent
geometric shapes that are sensitive to small mass variations. In
ﬁgure 4, for the cantilever with the sensor at xs = 0.09m, there
is a drastic change between the cloud of points in the case of no

the total number of points in the attractor. To understand the
diﬀerence in sensitivity between traditional resonance frequency
approaches and the PDFs method, the ﬁrst three modal frequen-
cies are calculated for the piezoelectric cantilever with the sen-
sor at xs = 0.09m in the case of no mass, and 10mg added at
x = 0.1m, x = 0.16m, x = 0.22m, and x = 0.28m. The results
are shown in table 2. The relative diﬀerences of the ﬁrst three
modal frequencies (computed from table 2) due to added masses
at the diﬀerent locations are all less than 0.2%. In contrast, if the
same cantilever is forced by the proposed nonlinear feedback ex-
citation (such that it exhibits the dynamics as shown in ﬁgure 4),
the relative diﬀerence of the probability density function of the
attractor between the cases of a 10mg mass added at diﬀerent
locations and the case of no added mass is summarized in table 3.
The results in table 3 show that the sensitivity is increased if the
feedback excitation through the PZT actuator is designed such
that the cantilever exhibits chaotic dynamics, compared with ob-
serving the changes in natural frequencies which is widely used
in current mass sensing techniques.
5 Conclusions
A mathematical model of a piezoelectric cantilever subject to
a feedback excitation through a PZT sensor and actuator has
been developed. It has been theoretically and numerically demon-
strated that the feedback excitation can qualitatively change the
