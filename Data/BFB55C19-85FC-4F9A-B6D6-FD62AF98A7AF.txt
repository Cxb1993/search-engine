二、計劃緣由與目的 
天然鑽石有高熱傳導係數 ﹝thermal conductivity; 20 W/cm·K﹞[1-2]，是一個絕佳的散熱材料，鑽
石散熱片有體積小的優勢，但因價格昂貴，一般高功率雷射二極體電子元件都採用較便宜的鋁或銅當作散
熱材料，尤其是鋁具備有下列優點：一、容易加工成各種突片結構﹝fin structure﹞；二、重量輕；三、
其特殊熱容量﹝specific heat capacity﹞高達900 J/Kg·K [2]，比天然鑽石的502 J/Kg·K高出不少，雖然其
熱傳導係數只有2.4 W/cmK [2]，約為天然鑽石的九分之一，工業界常以鋁當作高功率雷射二極體電子元
件的散熱材料。可是以鋁當作散熱材料有個缺點，因鋁需大體積才能將熱量移走，鋁的散熱結構的截面積
可高達5 x 5 cm2，高功率雷射二極體電子元件的成品不易縮小。 
自1990年代起，低壓合成鑽石膜的技術漸臻成熟，合成鑽石膜已取代天然鑽石在散熱片的應用，其中
最主要的原因有二：一、其生產成本比天然鑽石低；二、合成鑽石膜的熱傳導係數約 10 W/cm·Kg [3]，
雖只有天然鑽石的一半，但仍比銅的 3.9 W/cm·K 以及鋁的2.4 W/cmK要高出很多。[2] 然而一個好的散
熱片﹝heat spreader﹞需具備兩個特性：一、高熱傳導係數，能迅速將元件所散發的熱量傳導至表面；
二、有大面積的突片結構﹝fin structure﹞，能藉熱傳、對流或輻射將熱量帶離表面。[4-5]合成鑽石膜雖
具有高熱傳導係數，但因合成鑽石膜有超高硬度，不像鋁可以加工成各種具大表面積的散熱結構，例如加
工成為具有大面積的突片結構﹝fin structure﹞，本研究已成功研發出一些成長鑽石的奈米尖棒狀結構的
製程技術；我們也在風洞下，以不同風速，量測奈米及微米鑽石顆粒的熱阻。此兩種製程技術為（一）在
微米鑽石顆粒上成長奈米尖棒狀鑽石：利用鎳膜把微米鑽石顆粒鑲在鋁基板上作為結合[6,7]，再用電漿化

電漿化學氣相沉積法，在多晶鑽石膜上，成長奈米鑽石。 
 
三、實驗方法 
實驗有三方向：（一）在微米鑽石顆粒上成長奈米尖棒狀鑽石：將微米尺寸鑽石顆粒，均勻灑在直徑五公分
厚五釐米的鋁基板上，然後電鍍一層鎳把鑽石顆粒鑲在鋁基板上。利用電漿化學氣相沉積法，成長奈米鑽石在
微米鑽石顆粒上。把基板放上四吋基座上，放入電漿化學氣相沉積系統中[10]。通入 Ar/CH4/H2 氣體，用微波
功率 3000W 在 0.14torr 壓力下激發成電漿。低密度奈米鑽石結構在 Ar/CH4/H2=24/7/47sccm，基板偏壓
=-350V，時間 2hr 下成長。高密度奈米鑽石結構在 CH4/H2=14/24sccm，基板偏壓=-250V，時間 2hr 下成
長。基板溫度從室溫受到離子轟擊自然升溫到實驗結束時約 2000C。（二）在多晶鑽石薄膜上成長奈米尖棒狀鑽

flat p-Si(100) and pyramidal p-Si(100) substrates without any
catalyst at 750 ◦C in the planar-MPECVD system operated at
3000 W. The characteristics of the planar-MPECVD system
can be found in the literature [10]. The morphologies of
the samples were characterized by a JEOL JSM-6500F field-
emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) and an atomic
force microscope (AFM). The Raman spectra were taken
by using the 532 nm line as the excitation wavelength in
a high-resolution micro-Raman system. The field emission
characteristics of the samples were measured at 2 × 10−6 Torr
in a planar diode configuration at room temperature. The inter-
electrode spacing was ∼100 μm, defined by a spacer located
outside the emission area, and the emission area was ∼0.1 cm2.
3. Results and discussion
Figure 1 shows the top-view SEM image of the pyramidal
Si(100) with its side-view image inserted in the upper-right
corner. Large and small pyramids are randomly distributed
over the surface of Si(100). Each pyramid exhibits a four-
fold symmetry locally, whose facets are indexed as {111}
planes. In the fabrication of pyramidal Si(100) by etching,
large pyramids tend to be etched down from the intersection
lines of facets such that a large pyramid is divided into two
or four small pyramids as labelled at the positions ‘T’ and
‘F’ in figure 1. The maximum roughness of the pyramidal
Si(100) is determined to be about 3.5 μm using the AFM,
which characterizes the variation of the heights of pyramids
in figure 1.
Carbon nanosheets were synthesized on pyramidal
Si(100) to evaluate their potential as excellent field emitters.
Figure 2(a) shows the SEM image of carbon nanosheets
grown on pyramidal Si(100) with its enlarged image inserted
in the upper-right corner. The micron-size pyramidal
Si(100) is uniformly covered by ‘petal-like’ nanoscale carbon
nanosheets. All the ‘petal-like’ nanosheets seem to grow
outwards from the facets and upwards at the apex of a pyramid,
as shown in the enlarged side view image in figure 2(b). Each
‘petal-like’ nanosheet is about several nanometres in thickness
and about 300 nm in height. The outward direction of each
carbon nanosheet is approximately along the electric field
across the plasma sheath layer near the pyramidal Si(100)
Figure 2. (a) SEM image of the carbon nanosheets grown on
pyramidal Si(100). The enlarged SEM image of carbon nanosheets is

carbon nanosheets around the apex of a pyramid.
surface during growth in MPECVD. This suggests that the
electric field across the plasma sheath may play a role in the
growth of carbon nanosheets.
The carbon nanosheets were also synthesized on flat
Si(100) substrates using the same experimental parameters for
comparison. Figure 3(a) shows the SEM image of the carbon
nanosheets on flat Si(100) with its enlarged image inserted in
upper-right corner. The morphology of the carbon nanosheets
is about the same as that synthesized on pyramidal Si(100).
The major difference is the orientations of the ‘petal-like’
sheets that approximately orient upwards on the flat Si(100),
as shown in figure 3(b).
The bonding characteristics of the carbon nanosheets
grown on pyramidal and flat Si(100) are separately shown in
the Raman spectra in figure 4. Both Raman spectra exhibit
three prominent peaks: D (∼1330 cm−1), G (1580 cm−1), and
D′(1615 cm−1). The D peak arises from the A1g vibration
mode of the sp2 bonds in the aromatic rings of disordered
graphite [11, 12]. The G peak is from the E2g vibration mode of
all the sp2 bonds of graphite [11, 12]. The D′ peak results from
the size effect in microcrystalline graphite, [13, 14], which is
frequently seen in carbon nanosheets. Both I (D)/I (G) peak
ratios are around 2.8, indicating similar sp2 bonding qualities
of carbon nanosheets on flat and pyramidal Si(100). Besides,
a very weak and broad peak centered at ∼1125 cm−1 appears,
which has been assigned to be from the edge of the ‘petal-like’
carbon nanosheets in previous literatures [15, 16].

Two slopes exist in the FN curve for the CNS/pyramidal
Si(100) structure. The enhancement factor β is estimated to
be ∼3000 at high electric field (>4 V μm−1) and it increases
to ∼9500 at low electric field (<4 V μm−1). The value of
 is ∼5 eV for the CNS in the estimation of β since the
CNS is a form of graphite according to the Raman spectra in
figure 4. The existence of two slopes is attributed naturally to
the geometric shape of the carbon nanosheets on a pyramid in
figure 2(b) and is explained as follows. At low electric field,
the field emission current may be dominated by the ‘petal-
like’ sheets at the apex of a pyramid. The enhancement factor
β is large since all the apex points are closer to the anode
and the ‘field shielding’ effect among apices is weak due to
large separation [19]. At high electric field, the field emission
current from the CNS at the apex of a pyramid becomes
saturated due to finite emission sites. Additional field emission
current may be contributed from the nanosheets on the oblique
facets of pyramids. This reduces the enhancement factor β
to ∼3000, primarily due to longer inter-electrode spacing and
stronger ‘field-shielding’ effect. The two-slope phenomenon
is similar to the field emission from the carbon nanotubes on
silicon protrusions [20]. The change of the slopes in the FN
curve is considered to originate in a saturation of the emission
current at high electric field due to finite emission sites of
CNTs at the apex of a pyramid.
Note that the clear ‘two-slope’ character disappears in the
FN curve for the CNS/flat Si(100) structure. The enhancement
factor β is estimated to be ∼4400 on average, contributed
only by the sharp shape and the conductivity of the ‘petal-
like’ carbon nanosheets. The value of  is ∼5 eV for the
CNS used in the estimation of β . The ‘field-shielding’ effect
among carbon nanosheets on flat Si(100) is stronger than that
on the apex of pyramidal Si(100) due to the short interspacing
among nanosheets. This reduces the enhancement factor β
from ∼9500 to ∼4400 at low electric field.
4. Conclusion
A field emitter of carbon nanosheets on pyramidal Si(100) has
been fabricated by planar microwave plasma vapour deposition
without any catalyst. A low turn-on field of 3.2 V μm−1
and a high current density of 2.5 mA cm−2 at 7.0 V μm−1
are achieved, which are close to those of CNT emitters. The
enhancement factor β increases from ∼4400 to ∼9500 at
low electric field when carbon nanosheets are synthesized on
pyramidal Si(100) rather than flat Si(100). The fabrication
process of CNS/pyramidal field emitters is very simple, and
may deserve more attention in the search for excellent field
emitters.

nanotips treated with the PIII process are greatly improved,
which are comparable to those of CNT field emitters.
2. Experimental details
Diamond nanotips were synthesized on the intrinsic polycrys-
talline diamond/Si substrates biased at −250 V for 2 h in a
2.54 GHz planar microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor
deposition (MPECVD) system operated at 3000 W. The char-
acteristics of the planar MPECVD system can be found in the
literature [15]. The grain size, roughness, sheet resistance and
thickness of the polycrystalline diamond were determined to
be ∼1 μm, ∼200 nm, ∼6.4 × 105/unionsq, and 8.5 μm, respec-
tively. The polycrystalline diamond/Si substrates were cleaned
by acetone and de-ionized water and then put on a 4 inch sub-
strate holder in the planar MPECVD chamber flowing with
a mixed gas of Ar/CH4/H2 (5/14/47 sccm) at an operation
pressure of 0.14 Torr. The addition of Ar in the mixed gas
can enhance the nucleation density of diamond nanotips. The
substrate temperature was increased from room temperature
to ∼200 ◦C at the end of each run due to ion bombardment.
The synthesized diamond nanotip samples were then put into
a plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII) chamber flowing

frequency power of 350 W and at a total pressure of 4.4 mTorr.
The nitrogen ions in the plasma were implanted into the dia-
mond nanotips samples biased at a pulse voltage of −25 kV
(10 μs pulse width and 1000 Hz pulse repetition rate) for dif-
ferent amounts of time (0, 5, 10 min). The morphologies of
the samples were characterized by a scanning electron micro-
scope (SEM) (JEOL JSE-6500F) and a transmission electron
microscope (TEM) (JEM 3000F). Raman spectra were mea-
sured in a high-resolution micro-Raman system equipped with
70 mW laser power of 488 nm wavelength and a focus beam
size of ∼3 μm. The acquisition time of each Raman measure-
ment was 20 s. The chemical information of the diamond nan-
otips were characterized by using x-ray photoemission spec-
troscopy (XPS, PHI 1600). The field emission characteristics
of the samples were measured at 2 × 10−6 Torr in a planar
diode configuration at room temperature. The inter-electrode
spacing was ∼100 μm defined by a spacer located outside the
emission area and the emission area was ∼0.1 cm2. The car-
bon and nitrogen concentrations at a certain position on the
diamond nanotip were characterized by a PHI 700 scanning
Auger nanoprobe.
3. Results and discussion
Figure 1(a) shows the SEM image of the diamond nanotips
grown on a polycrystalline diamond film on Si. A low
magnification of the SEM image is inserted in the upper-right
corner. The diamond nanotips are in a cone shape. The
diamond nanotips are ∼1 μm in height and the diameter of
a nanotip at the bottom is ∼200 nm. The density of diamond
nanotips is ∼1 μm−2, estimated by the top-view SEM image.
Figure 1(b) shows the SEM image of the diamond nanotips
treated with nitrogen PIII for 10 min. After the nitrogen PIII
treatment, the morphology of the diamond nanotips remains
unchanged. Figure 2 shows a series of N 1s core level
spectra excited by Mg Kα (1253.6 eV) from the samples
treated for different PIII times. The N 1s peak intensity at

the emission current density is 40 μA cm−2 (at 11 V μm−1).
The field emission characteristics can be improved by the
nitrogen PIII treatment, as shown in figure 5(b) where the
corresponding Fowler–Nordheim (F–N) plots are inserted in
the upper-left corner. A turn-on field of 3 V μm−1 (at
10 μA cm−2) and an emission current density of ∼4 mA cm−2
(at 9 V μm−1) can be achieved for the sample treated
with nitrogen PIII for 10 min, which are very close to the
performance of CNT field emitters. The improvement of the
field emission properties is considered to be contributed from
the factors such as higher aspect ratio, higher conductivity and
diamond surface modification. By comparing the morphology
of diamond nanotips in figures 1(a) and (b), the factor of
‘higher aspect ratio’ is excluded since the morphology remains
about the same after the nitrogen PIII treatment. If we treat
the diamond nanotips as an ‘effective’ thin film, the four-
point probe method can be used to measure ‘effective’ sheet
resistance for a very rough estimation. The ‘effective’ sheet
resistances of the samples (diamond nanotips/diamond/Si)
treated with nitrogen PIII for 5 min and 10 min are ∼4.5 ×
104 /unionsq and ∼1.4 × 104 /unionsq, respectively. Obviously,
the ‘effective’ sheet resistance reduces with the nitrogen PIII

treatment time. This supports that the conductivity of the
diamond nanotips/diamond/Si structure increases after the
nitrogen PIII treatment. Based on the Raman spectra in figure 3
and the nanoscale amorphous regions in figure 4(a), some sp3
bonds are modified into sp2 bond characters after the nitrogen
PIII treatment. This may explain the reduction of the ‘effective’
sheet resistance. C KLL and N KLL Auger signals are used to
measure the corresponding carbon and nitrogen concentration
at a position on a diamond nanotip, as shown in figure 6. The
corresponding FESEM image is inserted in the upper-right
corner. The N KLL signal reduces in intensity abruptly with
sputtering time, which indicates that nitrogen concentration is
higher close to the surface after the PIII treatment. Surface
defects are expected to be generated due to the incorporation of
nitrogen. Note that field emission is a tunneling phenomenon
which is sensitive to the atomic layers on the surface. Very
probably, the improvement of the field emission properties
is also contributed by the surface defects generated by the
nitrogen PIII treatment.
4. Conclusion
Diamond nanotips with high aspect ratio can be grown on the
diamond/Si substrates by planar microwave plasma-enhanced
chemical vapor deposition. The field emitter made of the
as-grown diamond nanotips suffers with high turn-on voltage
and low emission current density. A nitrogen PIII treatment
can improve the field emission properties by the generation of
nanoscale amorphous regions with sp2 bonding characteristics
and other possible atomic defects inside diamond nanotips. A
low turn-on field of 3 V μm−1 and a high current density of
4 mA cm−2 at 9 V μm−1 are achieved. This may increase the
potential applications of diamond nanotips as excellent field
emitters.

(22Wcm−1K−1) [4,5], much higher than those of Cu and Al. The
size of a heat spreader made of diamond is expected smaller than
that made of Cu or Al, which may help to scale down the
packaging. However, most commercial heat spreaders have been
made of Cu and Al [6], rather than diamond, in the past decades
based on the following reasons. First, both Cu and Al are cheaper
than diamond. Second, both Cu and Al are easy to fabricate fin

experimentally the heat spreading property of a nanostructure.

1. Introduction
Recently, the progresses of high power devices and high
density of electronic packaging have intensified the heat
dissipation problem and stimulated the need of an excellent heat
spreader [1]. An excellent heat spreader for high power devices
usually exhibits high thermal conductance to transfer heat to the
of the nanoscale diamond tips/diamond/Si structures are of both
practical and fundamental interests based on two reasons. First,
the fabrication process is simpler than machining to make a
diamond fin structure, which is a onestep low temperature process
in a microwave plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition
(MPECVD) system and no catalyst is required. Second, the tip
structure of nanoscale diamond tips can be treated as a nanoscalespreading properties, especially at zero air flow rate. The improvement is attributed to the large surface area of nanoscale diamond tips. At an air
flow rate higher than zero, the improvement of thermal spreading properties diminishes.

The temperature Tc and the heat power Psteady could not be
measured directly, which are derived as follows. When the
steady state is reached, the power flow through meter bar
toward sample is the same as the heat power transport into the
diamond structure since the meter bar is thermally isolated. The
heat power Psteady can be estimated from (Tl−Tu)=Rm⁎Psteady,
where Tl and Tu are the temperatures of the meter bar at two
different spots “u” and “l” marked in Fig. 1, and Rm is the
thermal resistance of the meter bar (2.09 °C/W). The
temperature Tc can be estimated by the equation Tc=Tu−ΔY
(Tl−Tu)/ΔX, where ΔY the distance (1 cm) between spots “c”
and “u”, andΔX the distance (10 cm) between spots “u” and “l”.
Therefore, the value of Rq is determined by the equation [(Tu−
ΔY(Tl−Tu)/ΔX)−Ta]⁎Rm/(Tl−Tu) experimentally.
3.3. Quasi thermal resistance data
7597d Films 516 (2008) 7595–7598The nanoscale diamond tips can be treated as a ‘’fin
structure’’ of high aspect ratio, which provide large extended
surface area of diamond able to dissipate heat away. The
nanoscale diamond tips/diamond/Si structure is thus expected to
have good thermal spreading properties.
3.2. Quasi thermal resistance
The concept of “quasi thermal resistance” is developed based
on the heat transport across the nanoscale diamond tips/
diamond/Si structure and to the air at the steady state. To first
order of approximation, the heat dissipation by radiation is
neglected since the temperature of interest is less than 100 °C.
The routes for heat transport are limited by conduction and
convection in our consideration. The conduction of heat across
the structure is characterized by Fourier law of heat conduction.
Usually, the thermal resistance R is used to characterize the
conduction of heat by the equation
DT1 ¼ RTPcond
where ΔT1 is the temperature difference across the sample and
Pcond is the heat power for conduction. The thermal resistance R
is equivalent to (1/κ)⁎d/A, where κ is the thermal conductivity,
d is the thickness and A is the crosssectional area of the
structure. At a fixed flow rate in the wind tunnel, the convection
of heat out of the surface into the air is governed by the heat
transfer rate equation
Pconv ¼ hA DT2ð Þ
derived from Newton's law of cooling, where Pconv is the heat
power for convection, h is the heat transfer coefficient, A is the
surface area, and ΔT2 is the temperature difference between the
surface of the sample and the fluid of air. When the heat
transport reaches a steady state at a fixed flow rate of air, Pcond
equals to Pconv, which is defined as Psteady. The Psteady
characterizes the magnitude of power spread out of the
nanoscale diamond tips/diamond/Si structure, which is a
function of air flow rate. A concept of “quasi thermal resistance”
is developed to characterize the combination effect of conduc-
tion and convection for the structure at a steady state. According
to the two equations of conduction and convention mentioned
above, ΔT1=R⁎Pcond and ΔT2= (1/hA)⁎Pconv. At a steady
state, the two equation leads to (ΔT1+ΔT2)= [R+(1/hA)]⁎
Psteady. The (ΔT1+ΔT2) is defined as ΔTsteady that is the
temperature difference between the bottom of the sample and
the fluid of air, i. e. Tc−Ta in Fig. 1. We defined [R+(1/hA)]
as the “quasi thermal resistance Rq” that is the ratio of
ΔTsteady/Psteady characterizing the combination effect of heat
conduction and the heat convection across the nanoscale
diamond tips/diamond/Si structure.
The quasi thermal resistance Rq is experimentally measur-
able, which is used to characterize the thermal spreading
properties of the nanoscale diamond tips/diamond/Si structure
M.Y. Chen et al. / Thin Soliat different air flow rates. The value of Rq equals to (Tc−Ta)/
Psteady, where Tc is the temperature at the spot “c” (the bottom of
the sample), and Ta is the temperature of air, as shown in Fig. 1.Fig. 4 shows the quasi thermal resistances of various diamond
structures at different air flow rates in a wind tunnel, measured
by using the system in Fig. 1. The quasi thermal resistance of the
Si substrate reduces with air flow rate from 32.12 °C/Wat 0 CFM
to 17.07 °C/W at 3 CFM and to 13.50 °C/W at 6 CFM. This
indicates that heat spreading is more efficient at a higher air flow
rate. By depositing a diamond layer on a Si substrate, the quasi
thermal resistance is reduced by ~14% at 0 CFM, ~4% at 3 CFM
and at 6 CFM. Note that quasi thermal resistance Rq equals to
[R+(1/hA)]. The reduction of Rq is primarily attributed to the
high thermal conductivity of the deposited diamond film that
reduces the value of thermal resistance R. Both h and A are
considered not affected by the diamond layer. When nanoscale
diamond tips are deposited on the diamond/Si substrate, the
quasi thermal resistances are reduced further by ~7.3% at
0 CFM, ~2% at 3 CFM and ~1% at 6 CFM. The further
reduction of Rq is primarily attributed to large surface area of
the nanoscale diamond tips, which is supported by the following
argument. Note that the mean free path of air molecules is
~66 nm at 25 °C at atmospheric pressure [11]. The average
spacing between two adjacent nanoscale diamond tips (~1 µm)Fig. 4. Quasi thermal resistances of Si, diamond/Si, and nanoscale diamond tips/
