Abstract
Substrate with integrated microelectrode arrays
(MEAs) provides an alternative
electrophysiological method. The aims of this
research were to integrate optoelectronic
measurement system including near infrared
system and electrophysiological recording
system of impedance and action potential
measurements for neurons cultured on MEAs
under glucose and oxygen deprivation (OGD).
From the time-course recording of impedance,
OGD condition effectively induced damage in
neurons in vitro. The PC12 cell viability through
this OGD system was investigated with
fluorescent test before OGD, after OGD 30
minutes, and after recovery 24 hours to confirm
our model. Image processing techniques were
utilized to count cell numbers. The average
living cell percentages were 99.29±0.14% before
OGD, 53.50±5.83% after OGD, but almost
completely damage during recovery phase. For
extracellular stimulation study, cortical neuronal
activity was recorded and the suitable
stimulation window was determined.
Furthermore, the simultaneous recording of
optical backscattering and electrical signals of
neuron cells by combining the optical circulator
(OC) probe and MEAs culturing dish.
Experiments on PC12 or rat cortical neurons
under different osmotic conditions including
hypertonic and hypotonic influences have been
executed. Combination of electrical signal
acquired under the same stimulation can be
co-registered with the amplitude/phase variation
of reflection ray for further comparison under
OGD for observing the influence of cels’ 
intrinsic optical properties under ischemic stroke
environment.

Ⅰ. Introduction
With the advancement of
Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS)
technology, the microelectrode arrays (MEAs)
have gained more popularity with the improved
cell culture technologies [1,2]. Simultaneous
intra- and extracellular recording of neuronal
activity provided the usefulness of MEAs for
monitoring neuronal responses. The unique
feature of MEAs provides a powerful tool for
the study of the electrical activity of neural
3air in the OGD cage was monitored with a
thermometer and was controlled by infra-red (IR)
and electric fans manually. Second, The OGD
medium was auto-controlled at 38 ℃ by a heat
controller with an electric blanket heating pad
and a heat sensor (Model TC-1000, CWE).
Third, for fine tuning of the temperature inside
Petri-dishlike MEA, another heat controller with
mini heating pads and mini heat sensors was
utilized to auto-control the temperature of
Petri-dishlike MEA (BS4 64-0100, Harvard) in
Figures 2.

Fluorescent test
Live/Dead Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit
(L-3224, Molecular Probes), a two-color
fluorescence cell viability assay, was utilized in
this research. The cell-permeant calcein AM
(Abs/Em 494/517nm) is well retained within
live cells, producing an intense uniform green
fluorescence in live cells (ex/em
~495nm/~515nm). EthD-1 (Abs/Em 528/617nm)
enters cells with damaged membranes and act on
the DNA, therefore producing a bright red
fluorescence in dead cells (ex/em
~495nm/~635nm). EthD-1 is excluded by the
intact plasma membrane of live cells. Because
calcein AM is susceptible to hydrolysis when
exposed to moisture, the mixed working solution
must be prepared immediately prior to use and
be used within 1 day.
The concentration for PC12 cells were
calcein AM was 2μM and EthD-1 was 4μM in 
PBS (Altun-gultekin et al., 1998). The final
concentration of DMSO was less than 1%,
which was innocuous to most cells. For
fluorescent test, the cells were rinsed by PBS for
3 times to remove residual serum. 500μL mixed 
working solution was then added into MEA and
incubated at 37oC for 15 min. After 15 min
incubation, the fluorescence were observed
under an inverted optical microscope (IX71,
Olympus) with fluorescent filters (U-MWB2 for
live and dead, U-MWG3 for dead, U-MBF3 for
live, Olympus) and mercury lamp at 40X (4X
objective and 10X eyepiece). Images were
captured with CCD (CoolSNAP-pro-cf, Media
Cybernetics) using RSImage software. The
exposure time was adjusted manually within 0.3
to 5 seconds to obtain suitable images for the
fluorescence would blur as the exposure time
went by. Beside fluor fluorescent images, bright
field (BF) images were also captured for
reference.
Figure 3. The fluorescent and bright field images
were observed under an inverted optical
microscope with specific filters and captured
with CCD.
Impedance measurement under normal and
OGD conditions
An equivalent circuit for modeling the
neuron-electrode interface indicated that the
impedance spectrum depended on the impedance
of the electrode, the resistance of the sealing gap
(Rseal), and the shunt capacity between the
electrode wire and the medium (Csh) [2]. In this
study, resistance (Rs) and capacitance (Cs) of
sealing gap can be used to interpret the interface
between neurons and electrodes. Both of cell
adhesion and growth on the electrodes are
proportional with Rs increased. The cell line and
rat cortical neurons were used in this experiment.
First of all, the impedance of each electrode
without cells was measured. For impedance
5measured at a value about 151 kΩ. After the 
PC12 cells were seeded on the substrate, the
impedance value was dramatically increased to
the 286 kΩ. The impedance of PC12 was 
increased day by day due to the cell growth on
the electrodes. Similar properties were also
observed on the cortical neurons. After seeding
of cortical neurons on the substrate, the
impedance was dramatically increased to the
265 kΩ. 
The time-course change of PC12 and
cortical neurons during OGD periods was shown
in Figure 6. PC12 and cortical neuron cells
cultured for 5 days. Under OGD condition, the
impedance value of both PC12 and cortical
neuron fall into the same level of basic electrode
background value. This phenomena represent
OGD may cause cell detachment.

Light scattering responses on culturing cells in
different osmotic media
For the backscattering experiment of
cultured cells with osmotic shocks, both single
cell and clustered cells were investigated. Figure
7(a) illustrates the circulator probe configuration
in which the pink portion is cladding and the
light spot is core. As shown in Fig. 7(b), the
circulator shed-light area is just fit for aligning
one single cell. To continuously monitor the
response from neuron cell, the circulator was
aimed at cultured cells during induction of high
osmotic solution (10X PBS). We can observe
that the clustered cells shrunk first during adding
PBS and followed by a volume regulation
phenomenon within the recovery period, as
showed in Fig. 7(c).

The process of cell in normal, dehydration and
recovery condition (after 4min) by treating with
high concentration PBS solution.
Figure 8(a) shows an extremely amplitude
decay recorded by the commercial optical power
meter. The intensity decreased significantly
under hyperosmotic condition by adding 10X
PBS, and finally recovered in last four minutes.
Similar result of precise intensity changes can be
observed in our designed system, as shown in
Figure 8(b). Evident phase change can also be
observed in Figure 8(c). Once the dehydration
shock treated, the phase abruptly changed and
then gradually recovered to original baseline.
