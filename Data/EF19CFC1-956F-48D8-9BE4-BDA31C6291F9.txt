2. Experimental 
 
EAF dust sample used in this study was obtained from dust containers located at the bottom of 
baghouses in a steelmaking plant at southern Taiwan.  This sample contained 32.9% Fe, 28.6% Zn 
and 3.5% Pb as determined by Atomic Absorption (AA) analyzer.  The zinc ferrite samples were 
obtained by leaching the EAF dust with diluted HCl solutions and characterized by X-ray 
diffraction (XRD, Siemens D5000).  Results of XRD analysis of residual solids obtained after HCl 
leaching (Fig. 1) indicated that the ZnO in EAF dust was reomved completely after leaching with 
0.8N HCl.  Thus the zinc ferrite sample containing 28.9% Fe and 16.0% Zn as determined by AA 
analyzer used in this study was obtained accordingly.   
 
The leaching experiments were carried out in a 300-ml Erlenmeyer flask immersed in 
thermostatically controlled water bath equipped with magnetic stirring device.  The temperature 
could be controlled within ?1.0? and a 50 mm ? 8 mm teflon spin bar provided stirring.  
Distilled water and sulphuric acid were used to prepare the leach solutions (320 ml) with zinc ferrite 
(0.75 g) when the temperature of solution reached the pre-set value.  Samples of 2 ml were 
withdrawn at various times.  The zinc and iron concentration were aanlysis by AA analyzer.  The 
solid residues were filtrated, washed and dried for XRD and SEM analysis.  Experiments carried 
out at stirring sppeed in the range 300-800 rpm showed that stirring over 300 rpm has a minor effect 
on leaching efficiences of Zn and Fe from ferrite. 
 
3. Results and discussion 
 
3.1 Effect of temperature 
The effect of the reaction temperature on the leaching rate of ferrite was studied in the range of 45
? to 90? under following conditions: stirring speed 600 rpm, 2N H2SO4, 0.23 percent solid.  As 
shown from Fig. 2, the leaching rates of Zn and Fe are strongly dependent on the temperature. At 45
?, 37% of Fe and 55% of Zn were extracted after 100 min, increasing to 90% and 100% 
respectively at 90?.  The Zn leaching reaction was virtually complete in 30 min as shown in Fig. 
2b at 90?.  It is notable that the leaching rates of Zn were higher than those of Fe during the 
whole leaching process (Fig. 3).  This was probably because (1) Zn was concentrated at the 
external portion of zinc ferrite grains, or (2) the dissolution reaction occurs preferentially at Zn sites.  
Micrograph of unreacted ferrite sample and the mapping of Zn presented in Fig.4 shows that Zn 
distribute rather evenly within the zinc ferrite grains.  Thus, the dissolution reaction of ferrite in 
H2SO4 solution appears to being preferentially take place at Zn sites.  
 
3.2 Effect of sulphuric acid concentration 
To investigate the influence of H2SO4 concentration on the dissolution of ferrite, the experiments 
 4
To establish the order of reaction with respect to cincentration, the results of the effect of 
concentration on the ferrite dissolution rate, obtained from Fig 5, were applied to the established 
kinetic model.  The values of rate constants at different H2SO4 concentration were calculated for 
both Fe and Zn.  By constructing the plot of ln k versus ln[H+] in Fig. 8, the reaction order for Fe 
and Zn leaching with H2SO4 is 1.09 and 0.58 respectively.  The fractional order suggests chemical 
reaction; i.e., it is unlikely that mass transport contributes significantly to the control of reaction. 
 
3.5. Application on real samples 
The industrial test of extracting Zn from the EAF dust used in this study was carry out in a 250 ml 
Pyrex flask.  Heating was ensured by a thermostatted oil bath.  Twenty grams of real sample were 
treated by 200 ml solution of H2SO4. This treatment was carried out at 60-90? for 2 hr.  The 
effect of H2SO4 concentration in the range of 0.5-8 N was studied at 90?. The results in Table 1 
show that the increase in H2SO4 concentration generally increase the extraction of Zn and decrease 
the amount of solid residues. When the H2SO4 concentration is 4.0 N, 97.0% of Zn is extracted and 
17.5% solid residues obtained. However further increasing the H2SO4 concentration to 8.0 N 
reduces Zn extraction to 94% and increases solid residues to 25.7%.  The XRD analysis on solid 
residues (Fig. 9) showed that the components present in the residues were PbSO4(s), CaSO4(s), and 
residue iron oxide.  Evidently the decreases in Zn extraction for leaching in 8.0 N H2SO4 was 
caused by the rapid precipitation of CaSO4(s) blocking the extraction of Zn by H+.  The effect of 
temperature on Zn extraction was examined in the range of 60-90? as shown in Table 2.  The 
extraction of Zn decreases slightly and the residues increases moderately when temperature 
decreases from 90? to 60?.  Because the leaching temperature is one of the major factors 
contributes to the cost of operation, a moderate leaching temperatre such as 70? may be enough 
for an effective extraction of Zn from EAF dust in this case.  The solid residu, which contains 
PbSO4(s) and iron oxide can be further separated to recover Pb and Fe. 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
This work investigates the leaching behavior of zinc ferrite separated from the EAF dust in hot 
H2SO4 solution to evaluate the fesability of total zinc recovery by hot-acid leaching.  The leaching 
rates of Zn and Fe are strongly dependent on the temperature.  The Zn leaching reaction was 
virtually complete in 30 min at 90?.  Preferential solubilization of Zn in ferrite matrix was 
observed.  The kinetic study indicates that leaching of ferrite from EAF dust is controlled by 
chemical reaction with minor mass transfer control mechanism involved.  The activation energy 
was calculated to be 36.20 and 21.87 kJ/mol, and a reaction order with respect to H2SO4 of 1.09 and 
0.58 for Fe and Zn respectively.  For extracting Zn from the EAF dust, the optimun results were 
obtained for leaching in 4.0N H2SO4 at 70? when 97% of Zn was solubilized while solid residues 
composed of PbSO4(s), CaSO4(s), and iron oxide were obtained. Thus a total recovery of Zn, Fe, and 
Pb is possible.
