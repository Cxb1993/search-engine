2BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Remediation of recalcitrant chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs),
chlorophenols (CPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) often takes time and money.3
Long-term capping of those compounds might have limited their spread but often fails to further
their biodegradation partial due to their toxicity and stability and also due to the capping
environment they stay with. Most of these compounds are accumulative, are known carcinogens6
and at high dose are toxic to all forms of lives. For example, pentachlorophenol (PCP), one of
known general toxins that result in the charge balance between the inner and outer plasmic
membrane, leads to the cellular failure in making ATPs and at sufficient quantity causes the death9
of all lives (Madigan et al. 1997, Crosby 1998).
Remedying a recalcitrant compound such as PCP in a contaminated site could be
troublesome. Abiotic methods (Chen et al. 1999, Chen et al. 2006a, Chen et al. 2009) usually12
achieve a defined goal at the trade off of high treatment costs and the production of unknown
end-products after the treatment. On the other hand, biotic methods (Chen and Berthouex 2003,
Chen et al. 2006b) may degrade PCP by a cheap, natural mean but at a much longer treatment15
time. Capping recalcitrant compounds may not be perfect but is doable. One thing left to
consider is the long-term maintenance of the isolated site. Should we cap the site indefinitely or
may we do something to end the capping process as soon as possible? Capping with an optimal18
degradation of the capped recalcitrant compounds was thought proper and deserved further
studying.
As was mentioned above, the complexity and functionality of a capping process could not21
be overlooked. The evaluation of the involved environmental factors altogether was the key to
determine that which of those factors is the key that controls the toxin degradation in a soil
capping process. To answer such a question, we have studied the the most important affecting24
factors that might control the target compound degradation and determined the optimal
4anthracene, pyrene was treated for 404 days. Figure 2 showed that all treated PAHs degraded, yet
the degradation of indane and naphthalene nearly 100% and anthracene and pyrene only about
30%. It is noticed that the number of ring of the PAHs might have limited the degradation.3
Soil PCBs treatment- Soil contaminated with 5 mg/kg PCBs of 2,2',3,3'-PCB, 2, 2',4,4'-PCB,
3,3',4,4'-PCB, 2,2',3,3',4,4'-PCB, and 2,2',3,3',4,4',5,5',6,6'-PCB was treated for 404 days. Figure
3 showed that all treated PAHs degraded. Overall speaking, less than 50% of all tested PCBs6
were degraded, which demonstrated the difficulties in treating PCBs in a contaminated site- even
at low levels of PCBs-contamination. The overall degradation of 2,2',3,3'-PCB, 2, 2',4,4'-PCB,
3,3',4,4'-PCB, 2,2',3,3',4,4'-PCB, and 2,2',3,3',4,4',5,5',6,6'-PCB ranged from from 38-50%.9
Bacteria shit over time- A total of nine main bacteria were identified using t-RFLP with HaseIII
restriction enzyme. Three out of nine found changing their existence over time, preferentially
due to the addition of the pollutants in the soil. Figure 4 shows all nine main detected bacteria12
and the shit conditions of the three, namely B328, B409 and B618.
Archaea shit over time- A total of seven main archaea were identified using t-RFLP with MspI
restriction enzyme. Three out of seven found changing their existence over time, preferentially15
due to the addition of the pollutants in the soil. Figure 5 shows all seven main detected archaea
and the shit conditions of the three mentioned, namely A70, A180 and A416. The first two
archaea disappeared over time after the addition of pollutants. The A416 was inhibited at first,18
yet became a dominant species after some time.
