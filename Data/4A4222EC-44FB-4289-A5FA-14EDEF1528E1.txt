Abstract 
The aim of this research proposal was to develop immobilized enzyme based 
β-(1→3)-D-glucanase biosensors for the β-(1→3)-D-glucan detection for real food 
sample analysis. The project was successfully implemented in three major steps: isolation, 
immobilization and biochemical characterization of enzyme; development of photometric 
dip-strip biosensor; electrochemical biosensor and flow injection based biosensor system 
development. The enzyme β-(1→3)-D-glucanase was isolated from a novel source i.e. 
moth bean (Vigna aconitifolia) sprouts. The use of crude enzyme from plant material 
made sensing system more economical as compared to use of commercial enzyme. For 
immobilization purpose, different polymer matrices including synthetic, organic and 
biopolymer matrices (polyvinyl alcohol, poly-aniline, polyacrylamide, glass, gelatin, 
chitosan, agar, agarose, guar gum, etc.) were tested for the accommodation of 
biomolecule with retention of its biological activity. The immobilization of moth bean 
β-glucanase in agarose-corn flour-gelatin composite matrices was successful among the 
screened matrices. Further efforts have been made to fabricate enzyme dip-strip test 
systems for detecting β(1→3)-D-glucan. β(1→3)-D-glucanase from Vigna aconitifolia 
sprouts (8 days-old) with high specific activity was co-entrapped with glucose oxidase in 
different combinations of composite polymer matrices of agarose, gelatin, polyvinyl 
alcohol and corn flour. The enzyme immobilized membranes were checked for 
immobilization yield, pH and temperature optima, swelling index, thermal, operational 
and storage stability and morphology by scanning electron microscopy. The 3% 
agarose-2% corn flour-8% gelatin composite matrix was chosen for fabricating enzyme 
dip-strip systems for detection of β-glucan by spectrophotometer using Dinitrosalicylic 
acid i.e. DNSA method (System-I) and 4-aminoantipyrine i.e. AAP method (System-II). 
Dip-strip system-I and II showed linear dynamic range for detecting glucan concentration 
ranged from 100 to 500 µg mL-1 and 10 to 50 µg mL-1 with contact time 10 and 5 min, 
respectively. The limit of detection of system-I and II were found to be 65 µg mL-1 and 10 
µg mL-1, respectively. Hence system-II was employed for analyzing β(1→3)-D-glucan 
contents in various pharmaceutical samples. It was found that without any sample 
pre-treatment the percent error of detection was less than 5.  
Furthermore, β (1→3)-D-glucan sensors were fabricated using bi-enzyme and tri-enzyme 
immobilized systems with gold nanoparticles (GNPs) to increase sensitivity. The plant 
β(1→3)-D-glucanase (βG), GOD or/and POD in agarose-corn flour-gelatin (ACG) matrix 
were coated on platinum disc electrode to detect soluble β(1→3)-D-glucan. The atomic 
force microscopy (AFM) revealed that GNPs embedded in ACG formed tiny 
islands/clusters with enzymes. Both of bi-enzyme sensor (ACG-βG-GOD-GNPs/Pt) and 
tri-enzyme sensor (ACG-βG-GOD-POD-GNPs/Pt) had response time less than 20 s for β 
(1→3)-D-glucan. A linear calibration plot for bi-enzyme sensor was obtained for 
β(1→3)-D-glucan concentration ranged from 100 to 1000 ng mL-1 (R2=0.983). The lower 
detection limit was 30 ng ml-1 using applied potential of 200 mV and scan rate of 50 mV 
s-1; with signal to noise ratio (S/N) of 3. Fabricated tri-enzyme sensor was also operable

Introduction 
β-glucans are natural exo-polysaccharides and polymers of  D-glucose with β(1→3), 
β(1→4) and/or β(1→6) glycosidic linkages. They belong to the family of biological 
response modifiers (BRMs), and exist in the cell walls of some yeast, bacteria, fungi, 
cereal grains, bacteria and algae (Volman and Ramakers, 2008). A number of studies have 
revealed that the positive influences of glucans on health include antibacterial, 
wound-healing, anti-tumor and anti-oxidative functions (Jaehrig et al., 2008). 
Consequently, functional foods and nutraceuticals containing β-glucan are gaining great 
attention nowadays and which are traditionally determined with viscometric, enzymatic, 
fluorometric method and colorimetric methods (McCleary and Holmes, 1985, Aman and 
Graham, 1987). In addition, flow injection analysis for determination of oat and barley 
β-glucans was reported by Jadhav et al. (1998). These methods are time-consuming and 
require extensive laboratory equipment with trained personnel.  
The β-glucan contents of samples are traditionally determined with viscometric, 
enzymatic and colorimetric methods. Aman and Graham (1987) reported the enzymatic 
and fluorometric method for β-glucan detection. Wood et al. (1994) reported the use of 
specific chemical dyes such as Calcofluor and Congo-red for detecting β-glucans. The 
method of McCleary-Mugford (1997) is now recognized as AOAC International 
Reference Method. In addition, flow injection analysis for determination of oat and 
barley β-glucans was reported by Jadhav et al. (1998). These methods are 
time-consuming and require extensive laboratory equipment with trained personnel. 
Dry-dip strip test systems in combination with sensor (bio)technology have given new 
analytical platform to overcome these problems. Nowadays, varieties of one-step strip 
test devices are widely used in various foods, clinical and environmental applications 
(Bagal-Kestwal, 2011). This technology offers reliable results with rapid response, 
specificity and sensitivity with user friendly approach.  
During sensor construction, use of crude extract/enzyme is a common practice which 
avoids tedious and costly efforts of enzyme purification. In addition, stability of crude 
enzyme is usually higher than that of purified enzyme, which may be attributed to the 
micro-environment which is enriched with natural proteins and other available cofactors. 
However, sensors with crude enzyme might suffer from low specificity due to the 
presence of contaminated enzymes and proteins, and long response time due to diffusion 
barriers (Bagal et al., 2006). But this issue can be obviated by selection of enzyme 
sources with high specific activity. Thus, high reproducibility, availability and low cost of 
crude enzymes from plant source may be good candidates for construction of biosensors 
(Bagal et al., 2007 and 2008). The high expression levels of β(1→3)-D-glucanase in 
seedlings of barley, tomato, rye, tobacco and other dicots have been observed. 
Consequently, one of the objectives of the present study was to investigate the feasibility 
of utilizing crude β(1→3)-D-glucanase from germinating seedlings to fabricate dip-strips 
for glucan detection using immobilization technology. Recently we reported a dip-strip

mM concentration for 15 min followed by determination of enzyme activity. Effect of 
individual divalent metal ions (5 mM) on enzyme activity in absence of EDTA was also 
checked in this study. The enzyme was also examined for glycosylation using phenol 
sulfuric acid method. 
¾ Substrate specificity studies 
Substrate specificity for purified β-glucanase was done by analyzing the enzyme activity 
with different substrates. Enzyme activity with β-glucan (1.0 mg ml-1) from barley was 
considered to be 100 percent of β-1,3-linkage for comparing with other substrates (1.0 
mg ml-1 each). Different substrates used for this study included β-D-glucan (from barley), 
laminarin (from Laminaria digitata), zymosan (from Saccharomyces cerevisiae), xylan 
(from beech wood), amylopectin (from maize), starch (from potato) and carboxymethyl 
cellulose. Enzyme activity with different substrates was determined by dinitrosalicylic 
acid (DNSA) method. 
¾ Circular dichroism spectral studies 
Circular dichroism spectral study was performed using Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter. A 
quartz cuvette of 1 ml capacity with 1 mm path of length was used. The scanning was 
conducted at speed 100 nm min-1 and 25 °C, and the protein concentration of the sample 
was 0.1 mg ml-1. K2D software (European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL)) was 
used for data analysis for determining the structural aspects of the purified enzyme. 
¾ β-glucanase immobilization 
Simple entrapment and cross-linking methods were used for β-glucanase immobilization. 
For entrapment, 8 ml of chitosan solution (5% w/v) in 0.2M acetic acid and 8 ml agarose 
gel (2.5% w/v) were mixed at 65 C. To this solution crude or purified β　 -glucanase (70 
Units) with glucose oxidase (GOD: 150 Units) were added and the volume was adjusted 
to 20 ml with distilled water. Homogeneous solution thus obtained was transferred to a 
syringe with 21-gauge needle and extruded in the form of droplets in KOH (1.0 N, 100 
ml) for bead formation. The beads formed were filtered and washed 4 times with assay 
buffer to remove excess KOH. Immobilization by cross-linking was carried out by adding 
1.0 ml of glutaraldehyde (2.5%, w/v) to the sol-gel of agarose-chitosan at 65°C and 
enzyme beads were prepared after cooling by similar procedures. Bi-enzyme beads were 
checked for individual enzyme retention after immobilization procedure. Immobilization 
by entrapment (System A) and cross-linking (System B) were checked for immobilization 
efficiency and operational performance by 4-AAP method.  
 
II. Fabrication of photometric dip-strip sensor 
• Immobilization of β (1→3)-D-glucanase and GOD 
Corn flour (CF) (0.5-3 % w/v), agarose (1-3 % w/v), gelatin and polyvinyl alcohol gel 
(PVA) (0.5-3 % w/v) (2-8 % w/v) (Kumar and D’Souza, 2008) were individually 
dissolved in Milli-Q water at 60˚C with constant stirring till gelation. The blank (without 
 14
dip-strips was checked by standard fluorescence method using aniline blue (395nm/slit).  
III.   Application of electrochemical biosensor for β(1→3)-D-glucan in beverages 
 Gold nanoparticles preparation 
GNPs were prepared according to the McFarland et al., (2004) method. Briefly, 1.0 
mM gold (III) chloride trihydrate solution (20 mL) was boiled to 100°C, to which 2.0 mL 
of 38.8 mM sodium citrate was added. Under vigorous stirring for 10 min, a reddish 
brown solution containing GNPs was obtained and stored at 4◦C.  
 Fabrication of biosensors 
Bare platinum disc-electrode (diameter 3.0 mm; geometric surface area of 7.1x10-2 
cm2) was used to prepare biosensor probes. Sol-gel of agarose (A) (3% w/v), corn flour 
(C) (2% w/v), and gelatin (G) (8% w/v) were individually prepared and mixed in 1:2:1 
ratio at 50◦C. Plant beta glucanase, GOD and/or POD enzymes were added to sol-gel of 
composite matrix and 200 μL gel was deposited on electrode surface (Bagal-Kestwal et 
al., 2010). The bi-enzyme (ACG-βG-GOD-GNPs/Pt) and tri-enzyme 
(ACG-βG-GOD-POD-GNPs/Pt) sensors were prepared by a simple drop-cast coating 
method and allowed to dry for 2 h at room temperature under clean environment. After 
drying these probes were washed by immersing in 0.2M PBS (pH 7.0) to remove 
non-immobilized enzyme and unbound GNPs from probe and were stored at 4◦C till use.  
 Film surface characterization by TEM and AFM 
The morphology of synthesized GNPs in solution and entrapped in membrane was 
investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Atomic force 
microscopy (AFM) with contact mode. The β(1→3)-D-glucanase immobilized films on 
electrodes were removed gently and surface morphology was observed by TEM and 
AFM.  
 Electrochemical measurements 
Measurements were carried out in home-made 3.0 mL glass cell. A three-electrode 
system with saturated (KCl) standard calomel electrode as a reference electrode, platinum 
wire as the auxiliary electrode and platinum disc electrode (geometrical surface area: 
0.0707 cm2) as working electrode was used with or without modifications. All 
experiments were performed at room temperature using solution which was composed of 
1.0 mL β-glucan (100 ng mL-1) and 2.0 mL of 0.2 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS).  
 Reproducibility and response time 
The reproducibility of signal output of bi and tri-enzyme probes were checked by 
operating modified electrode in 0.2M PBS without glucan (3.0 mL) in 1.0 to -1.0 V 
potential range versus SCE. Effect of electrolyte pH was checked for both probes. The 
response of electrodes towards 100 μL β(1→3)-D-glucan (100 ng mL-1) was tested in 0.2 
M acetate buffer (pH 3.0 to 5.0), 0.2 M phosphate buffer (pH 5.5 to 7.5) and 0.1 M 
Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0 to 8.5). 
 Operational and storage stability  
The reusability for biosensors was checked for its repeated use for different cycles of 
experiment. Bi and tri-enzyme probes were washed after each use and tested for different 
 16
sample volume loop. The silicon tubing (outer diameter: 2.16 mm and inner diameter: 0.5 
mm) used were metal free to avoid decomposition of the produced H2O2 by metal.  The 
βG and GOD-POD beads were packed separately with an active packing length of 6.0 cm 
and the sample feed flow rate was 500 µL min-1. Both enzyme reactors were fitted with 
syringe filter (0.02 µm) at the top end piece. The enzyme-reactors packed with βG beads 
(ER1) and GOD-POD beads (ER2) were eluted isocratically (0.2 mM sodium acetate 
buffer, pH 5.5) at a rate of 500 µL min-1. The acetate buffer reservoir (B) and substrate 
reservoir (S) were connected to ER1 reactor by peristaltic pump P1. Further the standard 
or sample solutions were directly feed to ER2 bypassing ER1 for glucose determination. 
Three way connecters were used to control and direct the carrier medium or sample as 
shown in Figure 1. The product formed in ER1 was directly transferred to ER2 inlet. The 
ER2 reactor was further connected to injector valve through pump P2. The TMB and 
assay buffer solution were pumped and passed through loop to spectrophotometer (λ=660 
nm) using single channel peristaltic pump P3 which was further connected to computer 
for data storage. The final reaction product was directed to detector via flow through cell 
and after measurement the waste was discarded. The flow rate was maintained at 500 µL 
min-1 unless stated otherwise. The analysis was performed at room temperature and the 
column reactors were stored at 4°C when not in use.  
 
◆Optimization studies 
The efficiency of entrapped 1,3-β-glucanase and glucose oxidase- peroxidase were 
evaluated in terms of percent enzyme activity before and after immobilization. 
Photometric 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine and dinitrosalicylic acid (Miller,1959) 
methods were employed for this purpose. The βG modified Ch-GG beads (1.0 gm) were 
incubated with  1.0 mg mL-1 1,3- β-glucan  (500 µL) solution in 3.0 mL of acetate 
buffer (0.2 mM, pH 5.5) in test tube with residence time of 3 mins at room temperature. 
The βG beads were removed and GOD-POD (500 µL) were added to the reaction 
mixture. Subsequently, the enzymatic reaction was allowed to proceed for 3.0 min at 
room temperature. The spectrophotometer readout was taken at λ=660 nm after 
3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine (500 µL) addition using 1.0 mL quartz curette. For 
GOD-POD activity, the beads were tested by addition of 1.0 mg mL-1 of glucose (500 µL) 
with same procedure described above. Free enzyme activities were also checked before 
immobilization using same methodology by replacing enzyme beads with soluble 
enzymes. Solution of GOD (150 U) and POD (150 U) were used for the activity 
measurement. The entrapment efficiencies of the enzymes in the biopolymer matrix were 
calculated simply as the ratio of the total units of obtained enzyme activity to the total 
units of enzyme initially used for in the immobilization mixture.

Results and Discussion 
Enzymes may be immobilized on various supports to enhance their stability and 
re-usability. Wide spread applications of enzymes in different industries is possible 
because of the immobilization. Immobilized enzymes can be used in analytical devices, 
enzyme reactors, biosensors, etc.  Purified and immobilized β-(1→3)-D-glucanase is 
important for the structural analysis of glucans. The β-glucan, a macromolecule obtained 
from bacteria, fungi and plants, is recognized as a health-promoting compound which can 
protect the body against viral, bacterial and fungal infections, tumors, radiation effects, 
and stress-related immunosuppression. Recently we reported a dip-strip based biosensor 
and electrochemical biosensor for β-glucan detection, using crude enzyme from Vigna 
aconitifolia sprouts. Following the previous research, the objective of this study was to 
purify β-(1→3)-D-glucanase from Vigna aconitifolia, so that the chemical and physical 
characteristics of the enzyme could be determined. Further, we co-immobilize the 
purified enzyme with glucose oxidase in agarose-chitosan composite beads, and 
compared the characteristics of the free and immobilized β-(1→3)-D-glucanase. Attempt 
was also made to use the immobilized glucanase system for fabrication of mini-enzyme 
bioreactor and evaluate the feasibility of using this system for preparation of biosensor 
probes for β-(1→3)-D-glucan measurement. 
I. Purification of β-glucanase  
The aqueous extract of Vigna aconitifolia sprouts was subjected to 45 to 65% ammonium 
sulfate precipitation and resulted in 1.7 fold purification of enzyme (Table 1). Preparative 
gel filtration was performed using Sephadex G-50 column which separated the proteins 
into two major protein peaks. The fractions of enzyme rich peak (peak II) were pooled 
together and concentrated by reverse dialysis. This procedure yielded a purification fold 
of 3.3, and the concentrated enzyme was further subjected to ion exchange 
chromatography. The concentrated enzyme from gel filtration was loaded onto 
DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B ion exchange column. The loaded column was washed with 
phosphate buffer (pH 7.5, 0.05 M) to remove unbound protein and then eluted with saline 
(0.1 to 1.0 M NaCl) in phosphate buffer.

Figure 1. Molecular weight estimation of purified Vigna aconitifolia β-glucanase by 
SDS-PAGE under reduced conditions (Lane 1: standard molecular weight markers and 
Lane 2: 20 μg of purified β- glucanase treated with β-mercaptoethanol). Enzyme was 
found to be a homo-dimmer. 
 
In SDS-PAGE under reduced conditions, β-glucanase yielded a single band of 13.8 kDa, 
indicating that the enzyme is a homo-dimmer, with a total molecular weight of 26.5 kDa. 
Thus the enzyme is a low molecular weight protein similar to β-glucanase reported from 
millet and rice. The slight discrepancy between molecular weights obtained by the two 
techniques may be due to the glycosylation of the enzyme, as it contains 2.8% 
carbohydrate. 
¾ Circular dichroism analysis 
The spectrum showed absence of any strong negative peaks, indicating a secondary 
structure containing lesser extent of α-helix. Results from K2D software analysis also 
revealed that the enzyme is composed of 8% α-helix, 48% β-pleated and 44% random 
coil in secondary structure. These results are in agreement with that of β-glucanases from 
other sources where β-pleated structure was found to be the dominant secondary 
structure.  
¾ Physical-chemical properties of the purified enzyme 
The purified β-glucanase shows maximum activity at pH 5.5 in phosphate buffer (0.2 M), 
with 1.0 mg ml-1 β-glucan as substrate. The optimum temperature for the enzyme was 
found to be 45 °C and was stable (retention of 75% of its initial activity) in the 
 22
 
II. Designing and Application of dip-strip biosensor 
• Selection of enzyme and membrane 
Various beans, including red bean, broad bean, moth bean and black eye pea were used 
for germination and their sprouts were tested for β-glucanase activity. The moth bean 
sprout (8 days-old) was found to be a better source of β-glucanase with specific activity 
of 244 U mg-1. Aarose (A), gelatin (G), PVA and corn flour (CF) were used to form 
membrane for immobilization. Different concentrations and combinations were tried to 
obtain suitable tuning of porosity and thickness of the membrane (Table 3). Membranes 
with corn floor gel (A, B and C) forms slightly thicker film with more transparency. The 
membranes B and D were self-adhesive in nature which firmly adhered to glass and 
plastic support during the fabrication of dip-strips.  
 
For the membranes with non-adhesive property external adhesive is needed to prepare 
test-zone, which may have adverse effect on enzyme entrapped in the membranes on 
contact with the chemical ingredients of adhesives. Further, colour of the membrane is 
another important characteristic as it can cause interference during photometric studies. 
The choice of composite material was made by checking membrane forming ability, 
physical properties of membrane and swelling index. Based on these parameters we 
found that membrane B and D are the suitable candidates (Bagal-Kestwal et al., 2009). 
• Immobilization of enzymes  
Retention of both enzymes and leakage were checked for individually immobilized and 
co-immobilized enzyme membranes. A decrease in the enzyme activities (from 15 ±7% 
to 20 ±8%) was observed after co-immobilization with 75 to 93% of activity due to 
 24
hybrid silica-polysaccharide nano-composite was not stable above 37◦C (Shchipunov et 
al., 2004 and 2006). The optimum response for both enzyme dip-strips was found to be in 
acidic range (from pH 5.0 to 6.0). These findings are in line with the observations of 
other researchers where they have mentioned that pH optima for plant β-glucanase is in 
the range of 4.8 to 5.5 (Bewley and Black, 1994). To take advantage of maximum 
enzyme activity of both enzymes, pH 5.5 was used during subsequent studies. Results 
suggest that system–I showed reusability of 10 times (87% of its initial sensitivity) while 
system–II can be used for 14 cycles (80% response). In this study, both systems showed 
half life of 40 days when stored at room temperature and 65 days at 4◦C.  
• Calibration curve for both systems 
The calibration curves were obtained in the range 100-500 µg mL-1 and 10-50 µg mL-1 with 
LOD for System-I and II 65 µg mL-1 and 10 µg mL-1 respectively. Our observations suggest 
that both systems are quite satisfactory in terms of ease of fabrication and operation. LOD 
obtained by designed system-II (10 µg mL-1) is superior to System-I. Similar sensitivity for 
β-glucan has been reported by amperometric biosensor (LOD-50 µg mL-1) (Miyanishi et al., 
2004). Also the linear behavior with high sensitivity towards analyte, fast response, stability 
presented by the system-II is much better than system-I, therefore it was chosen for analysis of 
different pharmaceutical samples. 
• Pharmaceutical sample testing 
Results in Table 3, indicate that fabricated strips are reliable and comparable with that of the 
standard fluorescence method (Fuchs et al., 2007). This method can detect all forms of 
soluble-glucans while enzyme glucanase specifically detects β(1→3)-D-glucan, which attribute 
to the slightly lower values by dip-strips.

III. Electrochemical glucan biosensor for beverage sample analysis 
Agarose, corn flour and gelatin homogenous composite gel is capable of forming 
stand alone films or coating (Bagal-Kestwal et al., 2009). Our efforts have been further 
elaborated to study the entrapment of enzymes in ACG-matrix along with GNPs for the 
fabrication of electrochemical sensors. The construction of bi-enzyme and tri-enzyme 
modified sensors with good reproducible feature were achieved. The 
β(1→3)-D-glucanase activity was determined by DNSA and AAP methods before and 
after immobilization with GNPs. The bi-enzyme (ACG-βG-GOD-GNPs/Pt) sensor with 
β(1→3)-D-glucanase (7 Units) and GOD (15 Units) was based on direct electrochemistry 
of GOD. In case of tri-enzyme (ACG-βG-GOD-POD-GNPs/Pt) electrode 
(β(1→3)-D-glucanase: 7 Units; GOD: 15 Units; POD: 20 Units), the amperometric 
detection was done by reduction of hydrogen peroxide produced during glucose oxidase 
hydrolysis followed by horseradish peroxidase. Leaching was found to be negligible 
using spectrophotometric method.  
 Electrode modification and sensor characterization 
A typical cyclic voltammograms for various electrodes either dipped in PBS or PBS 
containing β(1→3)-D-glucan (100 ng mL-1) and all of the analyses were conducted at 
scan rate 50 mV s-1. The bare electrode and blank polysaccharide-composite matrix ACG 
coated electrode (without GNPs and enzymes) registered no electro-activity. Sensor with 
GNPs in ACG-matrix showed higher current than that of blank-ACG electrode due to 
entrapped and anchored GNPs at electrode surface which served as conducting interface. 
Immobilized glucanase with GNPs (without GOD) did not show considerable output, 
indicating the absence of interfering substances. Bi-enzyme electrode showed small 
reduction peak around 100 mV potential due to biologically active GOD. Amplified 
current with slight shift towards negative potential side was observed after addition of 
100 ng mL-1 β(1→3)-D-glucan in PBS, which was due to the enzymatic reaction 
involved electron transfer from glucan hydrolysis and electrooxidation of glucose to 
gluconic acid. The immobilization of a redox enzyme(s) together with colloidal gold may 
help the protein to assume a favorable orientation to make possible conducting channels 
between the prosthetic groups and electrode surface. GOD with flavin adenine 
dinucleotide (FAD) as a redox prosthetic group within its protective shell does not allow 
easy and direct electron transfer. The linearity of the peak current with varying scan rate 
reveals that the electron transfer of the FAD was a surface-confined electrode reaction. 
Further, the redox potentials remain unaffected implying that its reversible-redox reaction 
as shown below. The gold nanoparticles functioned as an internal electron transfer 
mediator between reactions and finally to electrode. An applied potential of 200 mV (vs. 
SCE) for bi-enzyme ACG-βG-GOD-GNPs/Pt probe and -175 mV potential for 
tri-enzyme ACG-βG-GOD-POD-GNPs/Pt probe were obtained by chronoamperometry 
and used for further study. The Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) for soluble β-glucanase 
from crude homogenate of Vigna aconitifolia was found to be 3.2 mM for β-glucan by 
 28
entrapment. The particle size of GNPs ranged from 12 to 15 nm. We found that individual 
and aggregated clusters of nanoparticles were evenly dispersed throughout the film after 
immobilization.   
 Response time 
The response of bi-enzyme and tri-enzyme sensors for soluble glucan was studied by 
chronoamperometry. The 150 mV potential voltage was selected for bi-enzyme sensor 
while the maximal response for tri-enzyme sensor was at -175 mV. The electrodes with 
entrapped GNPs had a higher electrochemical active area, which could result in higher 
revenue for enzymatic reactions and lead to fast electrochemical signal. Consequently, 
both of the fabricated sensors showed response time of 20 s. One theoretical assumption 
for rapid response is that GNPs may bind –SH group of enzymes/proteins and create a 
microenvironment similar to that of the redox proteins in native system.  
 Influence of pH on sensor performance 
Influence of pH on both sensors was studied in test electrolyte solutions with different pH 
values. In acidic range (3.0-4.5 pH), a moderate response was observed for both probes. 
In addition, slight shift of the reduction potential peak to the positive value was observed 
in the acidic pH range (data not shown). The highest response was observed in the range 
of pH 6.0 to 7.0. In case of ACG-βG-GOD-GNPs/Pt sensor, β(1→3)-D-glucanase and 
GOD are the rate limiting factors and both have optimal pH around 5.5. However, it is 
important to note that the fabricated ACG-βG-GOD-POD-GNPs/Pt sensor is based on the 
electrochemical oxidation of the GOD-POD after β(1→3)-D-glucan hydrolysis by 
β(1→3)-D-glucanase and all these reactions are highly pH dependent. In alkaline pH 
range, a gradual decrease in current response was noticed. These findings are in good 
agreement with Miyanishi et al., 2004. Stable and maximum response at pH 6.0-7.0 of 
our biosensors could be due to the contribution of the neutral novel polymer matrix.  
 Calibration curve for β(1→3)-D-glucan  
Various concentrations of water soluble β(1→3)-D-glucan were tested to obtain the 
possible dynamic range and lower detection limit for both bi-enzyme and tri-enzyme 
electrodes. Figure 4A shows CVs for electrolyte containing various concentrations of 
β(1→3)-D-glucan when bi-enzyme sensor was employed. A linear increase in the 
reduction peak and decrease in the oxidation peak current was noticed in the range of 100 
to 1000 ng mL-1 β(1→3)-D-glucan. Our result showed that the LOD for bi-enzyme 
sensor was 30 ng ml-1 with signal to noise ratio (S/N) of 3 when 200 mV s-1 potential was 
applied. Fabricated tri-enzyme sensor also showed linear relationship between current 
response and β(1→3)-D-glucan concentration ranged from 100 to 1000 ng mL-1, similar 
to the bi-enzyme probe, with LOD of 50 ng mL-1. The slope equation obtained from 
calibration plot shown in inset is Y = 9E–09 X -2E-06 (R2=0.989) (Fig. 4B). Hence both 
electrochemical probes showed higher sensitivity towards β-glucan than previous reports. 
LOD of 50 μg mL-1 for β(1→3)-D-glucan sensor was achieved by amperometry 
(Miyanishi et al., 2004), and 10 μg mL-1 of LOD was obtained by a spectrophotometric 
dip-strip sensor (Bagal-Kestwal et al., 2009). The reusability of both electrodes was 
 30

sensor. 
 
On the other hand, the tri-enzyme sensor (ACG-βG-GOD-POD-GNPs/Pt) was found to 
be more stable and reliable for practical application, thus it was selected for further 
studies. Table 1 summarizes the results obtained from fabricated tri-enzyme sensor and 
standard method. The estimated % error showed that the electrochemical tri-enzyme 
sensor fabricated in this study can be used with high accuracy. The fabricated sensor 
allows β(1→3)-D-glucan analysis being completed in a short time without tedious 
pretreatment procedure for "real samples."

estimated to be 3.2% when glucan standard solutions were measured for 10 times.  
 Flow rates of sample and buffer solutions 
The signal of the sensing process is related to the enzymatic reaction rate. Therefore, the 
flow rate which affects the dispersion of analyte is one of the important factors 
influencing the performance of flow injection analysis systems (Suwansa-ard et al., 2005, 
Ozner et al., 2011). In order to obtain an optimal condition for the FIA based sensor, the 
effects of flow rates of buffer, sample and reagent streams on the optical signal were 
assessed.   
 
Figure 5: The flow injection manifold for the β-(1→3)-D-glucan detection (B: Acetate 
buffer (0.2 mM, pH 5.5); S: 750 µg mL-1 glucan solution or fermentation samples; P1: 
Double channel peristaltic pump; P2 and P3: Single channel peristaltic pump; T: TMB; 
ER1: β-(1→3)-D-glucanase reactor; ER2: GOD-POD reactor; V: vent; D: 
Spectrophotometer (λ= 660 nm); W: Waste; DC: Data collector (computer); F: Flow 
through cell; I: Injection valve; temperature: room temperature ∼ 25°C). 
The flow rates for P1, P2 and P3 pump were standardized in different experiments to avoid 
the sudden rise of pump pressure during the assay. The flow rate of the mixture of buffer 
and substrate controlled by pump P1 was studied first to optimize the substrate dilution and 
analysis time (see figure 2). The flow rate range used for this experiment was from 250 to 
1500 µL min-1 with injection interval time of 1 min respectively. In the next step, standard 
glucan solution (750 µg mL-1) was introduced to buffer stream, which was further 
introduced to enzyme reactor ER1, and the products from ER1 were then transferred to ER2. 
The hydrolyzed product from enzyme reactor ER2 was allowed to react with TMB and 
passed to flow through cell for spectroscopic measurements using three-way valve. As 
figure 2 indicates, the maximum peak height was obtained at flow rate of 500 µL min-1. 
 34
steady-state and noise free signals were obtained at 50 μL sample volume with low 
recovery time. Hence 50 μL sample injection volume from hydrolytic reaction was 
finalized for all experiments. The enzyme based FIA practicability is often limited by its 
operational and storage stability. These characteristics were therefore investigated using 
standard glucan solution (750 µL min-1) and 0.2 mM acetate buffer at pH 5.5. The 
corresponding product absorbance as sensing systems response was measured after each 
measuring cycle when enzyme reactors stored at 4°C and reused. Total 206 injections 
were carried out in 5 months storage time and durability was checked simultaneously. 
The sensor signal was gradually dropped by 30% after 160 measurements. Still 
reasonable stability (∼45 %) was observed till last measurement during this study. The 
developed system showed durability of 140 days with 60% efficiency. While in a 
previous report glass bead immobilized beta glucanase and GOD sensor for seaweed 
laminarin retained 87% stability after storage at 4°C for 2 months (Miyanishi et al., 2004). 
Thus, operational and storage stability features of the fabricated system are favorable for 
the ongoing bioprocess in food and pharmaceutical industries.  
 FIA calibration for glucan standards 
Figure 5 depicts a typical linear calibration curve obtained from 200 ng mL-1 to 1.0 µg 
mL-1 glucan using acetate buffer (0.2 mM, pH 5.5) as a carrier stream. This kind of wide 
linear range is advantageous for glucan from different samples having wide range of 
concentration, and detection can be possible without pretreatment. Further high 
sensitivity of the fabricated system can be useful for the minimizing background 
interference for saturated and viscous solutions. The analysis time for a 50 µL sample 
was 30s with lower detection limit (LOD) of 50 ng mL-1 was achieved. The glucan 
standard was injected multiple times (5 injections) to calculate the coefficients of 
variation. The average absorbance values of the injected volumes were plotted against the 
substrate concentrations to check the linear relationship.
