while each subchannel adopts a single-carrier modulation
scheme with a lower data rate. When the carriers of the
parallel subchannels (often referred to as the subcarriers)
are made orthogonal, the resulting multicarrier modula-
tion is commonly called the orthogonal FDM (OFDM) [1].
Multicarrier modulation in the form of OFDM is widely
used in baseband and passband communication systems.
When applied to baseband systems such as the asymmet-
ric digital subscriber line (ADSL) communications, the
OFDM is also known by the name of discrete multitone
(DMT) in the literature [2]. Since the DMT and the
OFDM are essentially the same technique, we will use the
name OFDM for both baseband and passband systems in
this proposal.
The main advantages of the OFDM are its high spec-
tral efficiency and robustness against hostile channel con-
ditions such as narrowband interference and frequency-
selective fading. In addition, an OFDM system can
be efficiently implemented with fast Fourier transform
(FFT) and simple frequency-domain equalization. Over
the past several decades, OFDM has been successfully
implemented in many wideband communication applica-
tions. It has been adopted by many wireline and wire-
less communication standards to achieve high-speed data
transmissions. Examples of such include HomePlug for
powerline communications (PLCs) [3], ITU G.992.1 for
ADSL communications [2], IEEE 802.11a/g for wireless
LANs [4], DAB for digital audio broadcasting [5], and
DVB for digital video broadcasting [6]. An undesired fea-
ture of the OFDM signal is its high peak-to-average power
ratio (PAR) caused by possible constructive combination
of the subcarriers [1]. The high PAR makes the OFDM
signal very sensitive to nonlinearities of power amplifiers
in a communication link. As a result, the output OFDM
signal from a power amplifier can be corrupted by in-band
distortions and out-of-band radiations. This poses many
problems in the design of the OFDM receiver. There-
fore, characterizing the nonlinear communication channel
to understand how the channel nonlinearities distort the
OFDM signal is essential to the success of the OFDM sys-
tem.
One commonly used model for characterizing nonlinear
channels is the Volterra series [7, 8]. Modeling a nonlin-
ear channel with a Volterra series involves identifying the
time-domain or the frequency-domain Volterra kernels of
the channel. With the knowledge of the Volterra kernels
of the channel, one can predict the channel output for a
given input signal to see if the channel output is acceptable
before proceeding with expensive experiments. Note that
the number of the required kernel coefficients is often very
large even for a relatively low-order Volterra model. This
makes the estimation of the Volterra kernel coefficients a
challenging task. Early works on identifying Volterra ker-
nels of nonlinear systems were based on the assumption
that the input signal to the nonlinear system was Gaussian
[9, 10, 11]. Although the Gaussianity assumption on the
input signal greatly simplifies the involved mathematics
for estimating the Volterra kernels, whether a sufficiently
Gaussian input signal can be generated for obtaining a
satisfactory result is often in doubt. A more general ap-
proach which estimated the Volterra kernels by solving a
minimum mean-square error (MMSE) problem was later
developed [12, 13, 14]. Although this approach can use a
broader class of random signals as the input, it requires
estimation of various higher-order auto-moments (or auto-
moment spectra) [15, 16] of the input and calculation of
an inverse matrix. This leads to great complexity in terms
of implementation and computation, especially when the
number of Volterra kernel coefficients is large.
For identifying Volterra kernels of nonlinear channels in
OFDM systems, methods based on the assumption that
the OFDM signal is asymptotically i.i.d. complex Gaus-
sian can be found in the literature [17, 18]. These meth-
ods were derived based on properties of higher-order cu-
mulants of the complex Gaussian signal. In practice, the
cumulants are estimated by taking time averages over a
realization of the input and output data. Therefore, the
estimated higher-order cumulants of the OFDM signal can
only satisfy the higher-order cumulant properties of the
complex Gaussian signal when the amount of data is suf-
ficiently large. This suggests that a large amount of data
is often required by these methods to obtain a satisfac-
tory result. The demand for data can soon become in-
timidating when the number of involved Volterra kernel
coefficients increases.
The goal of this project is to develop novel methods
for estimating nonlinear channels in baseband and pass-
band OFDM systems with better performance and less
computational complexity, and for predicting the spec-
tral regrowth of OFDM signals caused by the nonlinear
channels. In the first year, we consider the approach of
using OFDM signals with spectral notches to estimate the
frequency-domain Volterra kernels of the nonlinear chan-
nels. Signals containing spectral notches are commonly
used in multitone power ratio (MTPR) tests for determin-
ing the signal-to-distortion ratio of a discrete multitone
system [2]. By using the difference signal yielded from the
channel outputs of two OFDM signals, one with a spectral
notch and the other without, we show that a frequency-
domain Volterra kernel estimation task involving a large
number of kernel coefficients can be decomposed into in-
dependent kernel estimation subtasks, each involving a
significantly smaller number of kernel coefficients. Due
to the small number of kernel coefficients, each individual
kernel estimation subtask can be solved with more accu-
racy and less computation. We show that, for an OFDM
system with N = 2M (M a positive integer) subcarri-
ers and a cubically nonlinear channel, the overall compu-
tational complexity required by the proposed method is
O(M4), which is significantly less than the O(M6) for the
Volterra series representations of the baseband and the
passband nonlinear systems, we will discuss the baseband
and the passband cases separately in the following.
3.1 Kernel Estimation for Real Baseband
OFDM Systems
Consider the nonlinear baseband OFDM system shown in
Fig. 1. Suppose that the subcarriers span a bandwidth
of W . Due to the possible bandwidth broadening charac-
teristics of the nonlinear channel, the channel output may
have a bandwidth as wide as 3W [13]. If the input and
output signals were sampled at fs ≥ 6W to prevent output
data samples from aliasing, then the discrete frequency-
domain third-order Volterra series representation of the
OFDM system can be written as follows [13]:
Y (m) = Y1(m) + Y2(m) + Y3(m) + ε(m),
−3M ≤ m ≤ 3M (2)
Y1(m) =
{
H1(m)X(m), |m| ≤M
0, M + 1 ≤ |m| ≤ 3M (3)
Y2(m) =

∑
−M≤i,j≤M
(i+j=m)
H2(i, j)X(i)X(j),
|m| ≤ 2M
0, 2M + 1 ≤ |m| ≤ 3M
(4)
Y3(m) =
∑
−M≤i,j,k≤M
(i+j+k=m)
H3(i, j, k)X(i)X(j)X(k),
|m| ≤ 3M (5)
where X(m) and Y (m) are the discrete Fourier transforms
(DFTs) of the input and output, and Y1(m), Y2(m), and
Y3(m) are the linear, quadratic, and cubic responses of
the system. The linear, quadratic, and cubic Volterra ker-
nels of the system are denoted by H1(m), H2(i, j), and
H3(i, j, k), respectively, in (3)-(5). The modeling error is
denoted by ε(m), and the maximum discrete frequency of
X(m) with a non-zero value is denoted by M .
However, in an OFDM system like that shown in Fig. 1,
the sampling frequency fs is often set to 2W instead of
6W . Under the circumstances, the resulting output data
samples are aliased. According to the sampling theorem,
those quadratic and cubic output terms that were con-
tributing to frequencies outside the range ofm ∈ [−M,M ]
in (4) and (5) will now wrapped around to show up in
the range m ∈ [−M,M ] as aliases. Therefore, the total
quadratic and cubic outputs, say, Yq(m) and Yc(m), in
Y (m) can be written as follows [14]:
Yq(m) = Y2(m) + Y2(−N +m), 0 ≤ m ≤M (6)
Yc(m) = Y3(m) + Y3(m+N) + Y3(−N +m),
0 ≤ m ≤M (7)
where Y2(−N +m), Y3(m+N), and Y3(−N +m) are the
alias terms. In (6) and (7), only non-negative frequencies
are considered because Yq(m) and Yc(m) are conjugate
symmetric with respect to the frequency 0.
The above analysis suggests that, when the sampling
frequency is 2W , the relation between X(m) and Y (m)
described by (2) is no longer appropriate and should be
modified as follows [14]:
Y (m) = Y1(m) + Yq(m) + Yc(m) + ε(m),
0 ≤ m ≤M (8)
If we arrange all the involved Volterra kernel coefficients in
(8) into a vector H(m), and all their corresponding input
terms into a vector X(m), we can rewrite (8) as
Y (m) = XT (m)H(m) + ε(m), 0 ≤ m ≤M. (9)
Note that the quadratic Volterra kernel satisfies the fol-
lowing symmetry properties:
H2(i, j) = H2(j, i) (10)
H2(−i,−j) = H∗2 (i, j) (11)
The cubic Volterra kernel satisfies the following symmetry
properties:
H3(i, j, k) = H3(i, k, j) = H3(j, i, k)
= H3(j, k, i) = H3(k, i, j) = H3(k, j, i) (12)
H3(i, j, k) = H∗3 (−i,−j,−k) (13)
Therefore, we can combine those symmetric kernel co-
efficients to reduce the size of the vector H(m) in (9).
By minimizing the mean square error E[|ε(m)|2] in (9),
one can obtain the optimal MMSE estimate of H(m), say
Hˆ(m), as follows:
Hˆ(m) = E[X∗(m)XT (m)]−1E[X∗(m)Y (m)],
0 ≤ m ≤M. (14)
Note that E[X∗(m)XT (m)] is composed of higher-order
auto-moment spectra of X(m) up to 6th order, and
E[X∗(m)Y (m)] is composed of higher-order cross-moment
spectra between X(m) and Y (m) up to 4th order. The
reader is referred to [14] for further details.
Note that calculation of an inverse matrix is required in
(14). The computational complexity of inverting a K×K
matrix is O(K3) [21]. By taking into account the symme-
try properties of the Volterra kernel, we see that there are
about M quadratic kernel coefficients involved in (6), and
about M2 cubic kernel coefficients involved in (7). Since
the cubic kernel coefficients dominate the vector H(m),
the size of the vector H(m) (and hence X(m)) is approx-
imately M2. This suggests that the computation of the
inverse matrix in (14) has an O(M6) complexity. We will
refer to (14) as the general input method hereafter.

frequency p in Fig. 4(b) is completely owing to nonlinear
distortions (and perhaps plus noise) of the channel. Since
X(p)(m) and X(m) are basically the same except at fre-
quency p, the relation between Y (p)(m) and X(m) can be
obtained by modifying (8) as follows:
Y (p)(m) = Y (p)1 (m) + Y

Basically, Y (p)1 (m), Y

3 (m) are obtained
from Y1(m), Y2(m), and Y3(m), respectively, by eliminat-
ing those terms involving X(p) and X(−p) in (3)-(5). One
can compare (25)-(27) to (3)-(5) to see the differences.
Next we subtract Y (p)(m) from Y (m) to obtain their
difference spectrum Z(p)(m). The result would be like
that shown in Fig. 4(c). Note that all the spectral lines
in Fig. 4(c) are completely owing to nonlinear distortions
related to the spectral lines X(p) and X(−p) in Fig. 3(a).

Note that the right-hand sides of (29)-(31) in fact con-
tain only those terms involving X(p) or X(−p) in (3)-(5),
respectively. The error term ψ(p)(m) in (28) is defined as
ψ(p)(m) = ε(m)− ε(p)(m).
at most N distinct cubic kernel coefficients involved in
(39). Since the cubic kernel coefficients dominate the vec-
tor H(p)(m), the size of the vector H(p)(m) (and hence
X(p)(m)) is approximately N . This suggests that the
complexity of inverting the matrix in (33) is O(N3) for
the case of complex baseband OFDM system. Note that
H(p)(m) only includes those kernel coefficients contribut-
ing to Y (m) and excited by X(p). By varying p from
−M + 1 to M , we can cover all the kernel coefficients
contributing to Y (m). This implies that, to get estimates
for all the kernel coefficients contributing to Y (m), the
computational complexity required by the spectral notch
method is N × O(N3) = O(N4). This is a significant
saving compared to the O(N6) required by the general
input method. Furthermore, as we vary p from −M + 1
to M , some of the kernel coefficients included in H(p)(m)
may have already appeared in H(r)(m) (r ∈ [−M + 1, p))
and been estimated earlier. These kernel coefficients don’t
need to be estimated again in H(p)(m). Therefore, for
those kernel coefficients inH(p)(m) that have already been
estimated earlier, we can substitute their estimated values
into (32) and eliminate them from H(p)(m). That is, the
size of H(p)(m) will keep decreasing as we vary p from
−M + 1 to M . This further reduces the computational
complexity of the spectral notch method.
5 Computer Simulation
To demonstrate the goodness of the spectral notch
method, we conducted simulations using the following cu-
bically nonlinear system [14]:
y(n) = −0.64x(n) + x(n− 2) + 0.9x2(n) + x2(n− 1)
+0.6x3(n)− 0.3x3(n− 1) + e(n) (40)
The frequency-domain Volterra kernels of this system are
given by
H1(m) = −0.64 + e−j4pim/N (41)
H2(i1, i2) = 0.9 + e−j2pi(i1+i2)/N (42)
H3(i1, i2, i3) = 0.6− 0.3e−j2pi(i1+i2+i3)/N (43)
The input x(n) to the nonlinear system was an OFDM
signal generated using (1) with N = 32. The complex
symbols used in subcarriers 1 to 15 were 16 QAM. To
ensure x(n) to be a real signal, the complex symbols for
subcarriers 17 to 31 were the conjugate symmetric copies
of those in subcarriers 1 to 15, and the symbols for sub-
carriers 0 and 16 were real random numbers. The additive
noise e(n) was a zero-mean, white, and Gaussian random
signal. The signal to noise ratios (SNRs) were set to 0,
10, and 20 dB.
For the input signal used in the general input method,
every OFDM symbol frame had a full spectrum. A total of
18000 frames of the input and output data were collected

mean square errors (NMSEs) of the estimated Volterra
kernels (including linear, quadratic, and cubic kernels)
achieved by the general input method (GEN) using 900,
1800, 9000, and 18000 frames of data and under the SNRs
of 0, 10, and 20 dB are shown in Fig. 5 (denoted by ×).
The NMSE of the Volterra kernel estimate was defined as:
NMSE =
||c− h||2
||c||2 (44)
where c and h are vectors including all the actual and
estimated Volterra kernel coefficients, respectively, and || ·
|| is the norm operator.
For the input signal used in the spectral notch method,
every OFDM symbol frame with a full spectrum was fol-
lowed by 17 copies of the same OFDM symbol frame,
but each copy had a distinct spectral notch at the fre-
quency p ∈ [0, 16]. The system output of each copy was
subtracted from that of the corresponding full-spectral
OFDM symbol frame to obtain the Z(p)(m) in (28). We
conducted cases with 50, 100, 500, and 1000 full-spectral
OFDM symbol frames, which leaded to total OFDM sym-
bol frames (including those with spectral notches) of 900,
1800, 9000, and 18000, respectively. The NMSEs of the
estimated Volterra kernels achieved by the spectral notch
method (NOT) for the 4 cases under the SNRs of 0, 10,
and 20 dB are also shown in Fig. 5 (denoted by ◦).
From Fig. 5 we see that, under the same SNR and num-
ber of data frames, the spectral notch method achieved a
smaller NMSE than the general input method. One possi-
ble reason for this is that, in the general input method, all
the Volterra kernel coefficients contributing to the output
