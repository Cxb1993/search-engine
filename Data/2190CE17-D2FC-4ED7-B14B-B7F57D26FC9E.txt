1. Introduction   38 
The use of chelators for enhancing phytoextration of metals has been the recent 39 
attention (Evangelou et al., 2007).  EDTA (ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid) has 40 
been employed for soil remediation due to its strong complexes-forming ability.  41 
EDTA is poorly biodegraded in the soils though its effectiveness at complexing metals. 42 
Excess amounts of EDTA may leach to groundwater and cause in subsurface water 43 
contamination.  The alternative is employed a biodegradable chelator such as EDDS 44 
(ethylene diamine disuccinate) which is an EDTA isomer.  EDDS is naturally 45 
occurring substance in soil which is easily decomposed into less detrimental 46 
byproducts.  Another biodegradable Citric acid has also been employed due to its 47 
complexation ability and been reported its enhancement of metal mobility in soil.   48 
Previous study was conducted to investigate EDTA, EDDS and citric acid on 49 
phytoextraction of Cu by Brassica rapa.  EDTA and EDDS had demonstrated 50 
comparable metal enhancement while citric acid effect was not significant that was 51 
attributed to fast microbial degradation of citrate and metal-citrate complex.  Results 52 
of their study also indicated that biodegradable EDDS were effective for prevention of 53 
metal leaching during chelator induced phytoextraction (Kos and Lestan, 2004).  54 
A novel green remediation approach intends to convey in this paper by 55 
employing plant to gradually reduce the soil metal contamination through several 56 
rounds of planting and harvesting.  Unlike phytoextraction, the phytoattenuation 57 
aims to reduce the soil metal pollution in a gradually and less aggressive approach 58 
such as chelator assisted remediation (Meers et al., 2010).  The initial pollution level 59 
generally is lower than most the soil contamination sites.  Therefore, plant is easier 60 
to propagate to increase biomass inducing reliable metal uptake.  The conceptual 61 
model is shown in Fig. 1 62 
chemical was used to prepare stock solution. Three heavy metals including Cu, Zn, 89 
and Pb (prepared as Pb(NO3)2, CuSO4 and ZnCl2) were prepared as 5 mg/L while 90 
three chelators EDDS, citric acid, and EDTA were with the concentration 5 mM.  91 
The initial average height and weight of vetiver was 30 cm and 18 g, respectively. The 92 
experiment was then conducted in a green house where in the condition with the 93 
temperature, humidity, and light intensity controlled at 33 oC, 60 %, 1500 LUX, 94 
respectively.  The growth responses of vetiver and metal removal efficiency were 95 
recorded.  The plants were collected for metal uptake evaluation after 7 days.  96 
 97 
2.2 Pot cultural experiment 98 
Sediment samples were collected from local farmland while the property of soil 99 
and the background metal concentrations are shown in Table 2.  Collected soil was 100 
artificially spiked with CuSO4, ZnCl2, and Pb(NO3)2, and mixed well, air dried for 5 101 
days to mimic the local contaminated levels which were 1000, 8000, and 8000 mg/kg, 102 
for Cu, Zn, and Pb, respectively.  These pollution levels were equivalent to 2.5, 4, 103 
and 4 times of Taiwan soil pollution control standard for Cu, Zn, and Pb, respectively.  104 
Three vetivers were transferred to each pot, filled with 1.5 kg and 14 cm of air dried 105 
soil in a pot with the depth of 17 cm and the diameters of 18 cm for following 106 
treatments.  Three chelators including EDTA, EDDS, and citric acid with the same 107 
concentration 5 mmol/kg were applied to each pot of soil at once initially.  The 108 
distribution and chemical fraction of heavy metals retained in soil were examined to 109 
investigate the bioavailability of adsorbed metals.  The fractionation of heavy metals 110 
was investigated by a sequential extraction technique.  Soil samples were placed in a 111 
plastic bottle then shaking for proper mixing.  Soil samples were then subjected to a 112 
five-step serial extraction procedure.  The procedure of sequential chemical 113 
extraction used in this study includes a series of reagents which represented as 114 
concentration in shoot by the metal concentration in root.  Reference to remediation 141 
factor in Sun’s study (Sun et al., 2009), phytoremediation factor (PEF) was defined as 142 
MshootsCshoots/MsoilCsoil or water in this study to consider both background metal levels 143 
and vetiver uptake where C and M were represented concentration and mass, 144 
respectively.  PEF was calculated for both hydroponic and pots experiment results to 145 
illustrate the phytoextration efficiency.  Schematic diagram of pot experiment and 146 
BCF, TF and PEF are shown in Fig. 1.  A triplicate of water and soil samples from 147 
each treatment were recorded and used for statistical analyses.  Statistical 148 
significance was assessed using mean comparison test.  Differences between 149 
treatment concentration means of parameters were determined by Student’s t test. A 150 
level of p < 0.05 considered statistically significant was used in all comparisons.  151 
Means are reported ± standard deviation.  All statistical analyses were performed 152 
with Microsoft Office EXCEL 2003. 153 
 154 
3. Results and Discussion 155 
3.1. The growth and toxicity symptom of vetiver in hydroponic experiments 156 
The increasing height of Cu+EDDS, Cu+EDTA, Zn+EDDS, and Zn+citric acid 157 
were 19, 16, 20, and 18 cm, respectively, while Zn+EDTA and Pb+EDTA only 158 
increased 5 cm after 7 days, indicating that EDTA posed adverse effect with the least 159 
height increase. Pb+citric acid presented the most prominent growth with the 160 
increased height of 30 cm.  The great propagation might be due to citric acid serving 161 
as a growth nutrient.   162 
 163 
Observation of root of citric acid and EDTA are shown in Fig 2.  The figure 164 
showed obvious biofilm attached in the rhizoshpere of vetiver with the citric acid 165 
addition while EDTA posed microbial toxicity to present clear solution relative to a 166 
remove rate with 72.9, 57.1, 70.9 and 6.9%, respectively.   The removal of metals 193 
were in the decrease sequence Pb > Cu > Zn.  For those data did not show in Table 3 194 
was caused by the treatment was ceased due the level off of solution concentration.  195 
Discrepancy of data might be explained by the metal adhere to the experimental tank.   196 
 197 
3.3. The impact of chelator on the uptake and translocation of metals in hydroponic 198 
experiments 199 
Metal accumulation concentrations in different parts of vetiver are shown in 200 
Table 4.  For Cu, the accumulation of heavy metal in whole plants of vetiver 201 
increased in the sequence citric acid > control > EDDS > EDTA.  For Zn, total 202 
accumulation concentrations were in the increase order of citric acid > control > 203 
EDTA > EDDS.  For Pb, metal accumulated in the whole vetiver increased in the 204 
sequence control > EDDS > citric acid > EDTA.  Regardless of the different 205 
treatments, the root parts were the plant most accumulation areas while concentration 206 
in other parts in the decrease sequence root > stem > leave. 207 
 208 
Previous study was conducted using EDDS for the essential Cu and Zn and 209 
non-essential Pb uptake by sunflower in a hydroponic experiment.  EDDS alleviated 210 
the phytotoxicity when added to the Cu and Zn solution due to the reduction in the 211 
free metal concentration forming EDDS metal complexes in solution (Tandy et al., 212 
2006).  Jean’ study reported that the translocation from root to stem was associated 213 
with metal chelation enhance its transport to stem by reducing the affinity for the 214 
binding site in the cell walls.  Metal complex was not retained by ion exchange as 215 
compared to free metal ions (Jean et al. 2008).   216 
 217 
The mechanism of metal complex transportation enables the understanding of 218 
within plant Polygonum thunbergii increased in the decreasing sequence of Cd < Pb < 245 
Zn < Cu, and bioaccumulation coefficients increased in the order of Cd (2.0) < Pb (3.2) 246 
< Zn (13.1) < Cu (17.2) (Kim et al., 2003).  The discrepancies of BCF from our 247 
results might be due to variation in heavy metal concentration and plant species.  248 
BCF results showed overall negative effect in addition of EDTA in our study.     249 
 250 
TF has been defined the concentration of aerial parts divided by the 251 
concentration of the root.  The ratio can be used to evaluate the translocation effects 252 
in vetiver.  TF for each treatment was all less than 1 and indicating the remaining 253 
metal were primarily located in the roots.  For Cu, EDDS, citric acid, EDTA were by 254 
3.3, 1.2, and 7.7 folds (p = 0.009, 0.48, and 0.003) increase relative to the control, 255 
respectively.  EDTA presented statistically significant (p = 0.018 and 0.0029) 256 
translocation ability compared to EDDS and citric acid, respectively.  For Zn, EDDS, 257 
citric acid, EDTA were by 1.0, 1.2, and 1.1 folds compare to the control TF value, 258 
respectively.  Three chelators did not present significant variation (P > 0.05).  For 259 
Pb, EDDS, citric acid, EDTA were by 1.2, 0.3, and 2.6 folds comparing to the control, 260 
respectively.  EDTA showed the significant difference when it compared to other two 261 
chelators (p= EDDS: 0.008; EDTA: 0.0008).  Based on these TF analyses, EDTA 262 
demonstrated better translocation for Cu and Pb compared to the control.   263 
PEF indicates the concentration in the aerial parts divided by the concentration in 264 
solution, and both concentration times the vetiver mass and water weight, respectively.  265 
For Cu, PEF value for control, EDDS, citric acid, and EDTA were 3.64, 3.25, 3.02, 266 
and 3.94, respectively.  PEF did not present significant variations (P > 0.05) among 267 
three chelators when they compared with each other with t-test.   For Zn, PEF for 268 
control, EDDS, citric acid, and EDTA were 11.62, 8.86, 12.93, and 12.27, respectively 269 
while for Pb for control, EDDS, citric acid, and EDTA were 8.90, 10.73, 3.01, and 270 
approximately 1,000, 8,000, and 8,000 mg/kg, respectively which is higher than that 297 
most recent phytoextraction studies.  Heavy metals associated with different 298 
fractions have varied soil mobility and plant uptake efficiency.  The latter three 299 
fractions, namely organic, Fe- and Mn-hydroxide, and sulfide are more inert, 300 
permanently bound to soils, and less bioavailable while first two fractions including 301 
exchangeable and inorganic have been defined as loosely bound.  302 
For Cu, first two fractions of control, Cu+EDDS, Cu+citric acid, and Cu+EDTA 303 
were 1.3, 40.6, 11.1, and 49.7% of total extracted metals, respectively.  The mobility 304 
effects of three chelators to Cu were in the decreasing order EDTA > EDDS > citric 305 
acid.  EDTA increased the amounts of loosely bound Cu relative to control that 306 
indicated soil Cu mobility was enhanced.  For Zn, first two fractions of control, 307 
Zn+EDDS, Zn +citric acid, and Zn +EDTA were 56.5, 57.4, 63.4, and 65.6% of total 308 
extracted metals, respectively.  The percentages of first two fractions of control and 309 
three chelators were showing no significant difference.  The loosely bound 310 
percentages for Zn+EDDS, Zn +citric acid, and Zn +EDTA only presented 1.0, 1.2 311 
and 1.3 times relative to the control.   Three chelators did not demonstrate 312 
significant enhancement for Zn mobility.  The reason might be due Zn is commonly 313 
treated as a loosely adsorbed metal which led to less firmly attached in soil matrix.   314 
For Pb, first two fractions of control, Pb +EDDS, Pb +citric acid, and Pb +EDTA were 315 
5.1, 10.5, 6.8, and 24.8% of total extracted metals respectively.  The first two 316 
fraction percentages for Pb +EDDS, Pb +citric acid, and Pb +EDTA presented 1.8, 1.2 317 
and 4.6 folds compared to the control. EDDS, citric acid, and EDDA were significant 318 
difference with the p value 0.001, 0.024, 1.1×10-5, respectively, with respect to the 319 
control.   The mobility effects of three chelators to Pb are in the increase order of 320 
EDTA > EDDS > citric acid which is similar to that of Cu.   321 
Previous study investigated the use of EDTA for Pb phytoextraction and found 322 
of treatment.  All Zn treated vetiver were presented serious chlorosis and wilt 348 
symptom at the 14th day.  For Pb, all treatments presented yellowing at 10th day and 349 
the toxic effect was the in the order of EDTA> citric acid> EDDS.  According to the 350 
aforementioned results, the toxic effect of EDTA was more significant than that of 351 
other two chelators.   352 
4. Conclusion 353 
Vetiver has demonstrated as a valid candidate for chelator assisted phytoextration 354 
in our study.  In hydroponic experiment, root zone observation showed obvious 355 
biofilm attached in the rhizoshpere of vetiver with the citric acid addition due to it 356 
serving as growth substrate while EDTA posed microbial toxicity to present clear 357 
solution.  Hydroponic test can be employed to screen the toxicity of chelator and 358 
metal uptake rate.  In pot experiment, the unprecedented finding of this study is that 359 
vetiver has achieved the hyperaccumulator in the condition of EDDS addition for Cu, 360 
all three chelators for Zn, and EDTA for Pb.   Vetiver possesses the great biomass 361 
propagation, profuse root which can penetrate to the deeper contaminated soil.  362 
Chelator assisted phytoextration with vetiver can be a green alternation to 363 
conventional costly and not environmental friendly physical-chemical technologies. 364 
Biostimulators, GA3and IAA, have demonstrated effective plant propagation 365 
enhancement.  Cu descending levels were statistically significant relative to the 366 
control.   The the soil metal level reduction achieved acceptable levels.  More 367 
rounds of planting and harvesting, the the soil metal concentrations expected to be 368 
much lessoned in real sites.  Green remediation concepts such as the 369 
phytoattenuation and phytoextration need to be taken as serious concern. 370
