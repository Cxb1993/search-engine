Abstract  
Lead time reduction has been one of the major factors in the successful implementation of the 
popular just-in-time (JIT) inventory system. In many practical situations, this controllable lead time 
can be decomposed into several components, each having a crashing cost for the reduced lead time 
and the associated crashing expenses contains a fixed cost and a variable cost per unit product. If an 
item is out of stock in an inventory system in which shortage is allowed, the supplier may offer a 
negotiable price discount to the loyal, patient and captive customers to compensate for the 
inconvenience of backordering. This project studies the integrated inventory systems with the 
objective to simultaneously optimizing the order period, lead time, backorder discount and service 
level. Because the reduction of inventory cost plays an important role in production management, 
this research builds a decision support system to deal with the optimal reorder point inventory model. 
In the decision support system concerning about the inventory model, we take many parameters into 
account and help the decision maker to take choice. 
Keywords: inventory, lead time, crashing cost, backorder discount, service level

with period review time, backorder discount and lead time. Once we build the decision 
support system, we can use the result to apply into other inventory model and adjust the 
parameter to fit the other different inventory situations. 
 
2. Assumptions 
The following assumptions are made in this research: 
1. The inventory level is reviewed every T units of time. A sufficient quantity is 
ordered up to the target level r. The target level r = expected demand during lead 
time + safety stock, that is, r = D(T+L) + kσ LT + , where k is a nonnegative 
safety factor. 
2. The lead time L has n mutually independent components, where the ith component 
has a normal duration Ti and a minimum duration ti, i = 1, 2, …, n and a crashing 
cost per unit time ai. These ai′s are arranged such that a1 ≤ a2 ≤ … ≤ an. The lead 
times are crashed one component at a time starting with the one of least ci, and so 
on. 
3. Let Li denote the length of lead time with component 1, 2, …, i crashed to their 
minimum values, then Li can be expressed as Li = 1
n
jj
U=∑ − 1( ).i j jj U u= −∑  Thus, the 
lead time crashing cost R(L) per replenishment cycle is given by 
R(L) = ai (Li−1 − L) + 11 ( )
i
j j jj
a U u−= −∑ ,  for L ∈ [Li, Li−1]. 
4. The backorder ratio β is variable and is in proportion to the backorder price discount 
offered by the supplier per unit πx; thus, β = β0πx/π0, for 0 < β0 ≤ 1, 0 ≤ πx ≤ π0 [13]. 
 
3.Decision Support System 
Sprague and Carson [15] thought a complete framework of decision support system 
should include the following events shown as figure 1: 
z Data Base：Store up the data that the decision support system requires. 
z Model Base：Store up the data analysis model and decision analysis model or view 
these models as sub-patterns which are independent with each other. 
z Software System：The software system includes the following three subsystems. 
1. Data Base Management Subsystem, DBMSs. 
2. Model Base Management Subsystem, MBMSs. 
3. Dialog Generation and Management Subsystem, DGMSs.

4. Normal demand model 
 
The problem under study is to minimize the following total expected annual cost: 
EAC(T, πx, k, L) = OC + HC + SC + CC 
where OC stands for ordering cost, HC for holding cost, SC for shortage cost, and 
CC for crashing cost. Consequently, the total expected annual cost EAC(T, πx, k, L) is

the model can be expressed as EAC(T, πx, k, L) = OC + HC + SC + CC. While the 
expected ordering and expected crashing costs are of the same forms as those of the 
normal demand model, the expected shortage at the end of a cycle can be expressed by

Since the form of the lead time demand distribution is not known, the minimax 
criterion is applied to find the least favorite distribution function inΩ for each (T, πx, k, L) 
and then find the optimal values of T*, πx*, k*and L*that minimize the expected total 
annual cost. In mathematical symbolization, the problem under investigation can be

Numerical Example  
Consider an inventory system with the following data: D = 600 units/year, A = $200 
per order, h = $20 per unit per year, π0 = $150 per unit, σ = 7 unit/week, and the lead 
time has three components with data shown in Table 1 [13]. Apply the proposed 
algorithm to solve the problem for the upper bound of the backorder ratio β0 = 0.95, 0.80, 
0.65, 0.50, 0.35 and 0.20, respectively. The resulting optimal solutions are summarized in 
Table 2 and Table 3.

6.Conclusions 
This project extends the Pan and Hsiao model [13] to study the impact of safety 
factor on the periodic review inventory model involving controllable lead time and 
backorder price discount with mixture of backorder and partial lost sales. The objective is 
to minimize the expected total annual cost by simultaneously optimizing order period, 
backorder price discount, safety factor and lead time. There are two models considered in
