fraction, inspection/ reprocessing cost, etc.. There 
are considerable attention paid to the 
filling/canning problem for determining the 
optimum manufacturing target and other important 
parameters, e.g., Springer (1951), Hunter and 
Kartha (1977), Carlsson (1984, 1989), Bisgaard et 
al. (1984), Golhar (1987, 1988), Golhar and 
Pollock (1988, 1992), Rahim and Banerjee (1988), 
Arcelus and Rahim (1990), Boucher and Jafari 
(1991), Al-Sultan (1994), Pulak and Al-sultan 
(1996), Al-Sultan and Al-Fawzan (1997), 
Al-Sultan and Pulak (1997), Lee and Jang (1997), 
Misiorek and Barnett (2000), Phillips and Cho 
(2000), Lee and Elsayed (2002), Lee, et al. (2000, 
2001), Duffuaa and Siddiqi (2002) and so forth. 
The piecewise linear profit/cost function is usually 
used in this work. 
     Roan et al. (2000) and Rahim and Tuffaha 
(2004) have proposed the problem of jointing 
designs of optimum process mean and economic 
production run. Roan et al. (2000) considered the 
stable production process. Rahim and Tuffaha 
(2004) introduced the shift production process and 
adopted the inspection scheme for the imperfect 
EMQ model. In this study, we will present a 
modified EMQ model with the imperfect product 
quality. A modified Pulak and Al-Sultan’s (1996) 
cost function under the rectifying inspection plan 
is inserted into the modified EMQ model. The total 
inventory cost includes the set-up cost, the holding 
cost, and the quality cost. By solving the modified 
EQM model, we can obtain both the optimum 
combination of EMQ and process mean in order to 
have the minimum total inventory cost. The 
symmetric quadratic quality loss function is 
applied in evaluating the product quality. 
 
2. Theory Review—Economic 
Manufacturing Quantity Model 
 
For the purpose of developing a EMQ model, 
the following assumptions are made: 
1. The manufacturing system consists of a 
single process or machine engaged in the 
production of a single item. 
2. The perfect quality occurs in production 
process. 
  3. There is no shortage cost. 
4. Demand of the produced item is continuous 
and constant and all demands must be met 
 (production rate > demand rate). 
5. The price of per unit material in production is 
at a fixed cost and has nothing to do with the 
purchasing quantity. 
The total inventory cost of EMQ model 
includes the set-up cost and the holding cost, that 
is,

Q is the economic manufacturing quantity; S is the 
set-up cost for each production run; O is the 
demand rate in units per day; W is the production 
rate in units per day, W>O; h is the holding cost 
per unit item per unit time.

3. Modified EMQ Model  
 
   We consider the modified EMQ model with 
the imperfect quality. In the production process, a 
product has two-sided specification limits and its 
quality characteristic is normally distributed with 
known standard deviation. The symmetric 
quadratic quality loss function is applied in the 
evaluating the product quality. Assume that the 
production process is stable. A economic 
manufacturing quantity of product is regarded as a 
lot size and inspected by rectifying inspection plan. 
In rectifying inspection plan, one needs to do 
100% inspection for the product of the rejected lot 
and replace the non-conforming items by the 
conforming ones. The non-conforming items in the 
sample of accepted lot are usually replaced by 
conforming ones.

It is difficult to show that Eq. (10) is a convex 
function. For the given parameters, we may apply 
the multi-dimensional search method, e.g.,  
pattern search method, to obtain the optimal 
economic manufacturing quantity and the 
process mean  which has the minimum total 
inventory cost . The optimal solution of 
modified EMQ depends on the cost parameters. 
The influences of all of them need to be illustrated 
by adopting the sensitivity analysis.

4. Numerical Example and Sensitivity 
Analysis of Parameters 
 
    Consider that the quality characteristic is 
normally distributed with unknown μ . The 
known standard deviation .5.0=σ  The and 
of the product are 10 and 15, respectively. Let

processing per item c =5, and the cost of replacing 
a defective item by an acceptable item

Assume that the target value of the product t = 
12.5. Hence, the quality loss coefficient k = 
10/ = 1.6. Let the demand quantity in units 
per year M = 8000, the set-up cost for each 
production run = 20, the demand rate in units 
per day O = 80, the production rate in units per day 
I = 100, and the holding cost per unit tem per year 
h =10. We would like to obtain the combination 
 of parameters having the minimum total 
inventory cost.;

5. Conclusions 
 
In this study, we have presented the modified 
EMQ model by considering the quality cost.  The 
modified Pulak and Al-Sultan’s (1996) cost 
function with unknown process mean under the 
rectifying inspection plan is adopting in the 
modified EMQ model. From the above numerical 
results, we have the following conclusions: (1) the 
reprocessing cost and the demand quantity per unit 
time have a moderate effect on the total inventory 
cost; (2) the demand quantity per unit time, the 
set-up cost for per production run, the production 
quantity per day, the demand quantity per day, and 
the holding cost per unit item per unit time only 
effect the economic manufacturing quantity but 
they have no effect on the process mean. The 
extension to the different modified EMQ model 
with the economic specification limits may be left 
for further study.
