INTRODUCTION 
  The main goal of this research is to develop 
a Gilbert mixer and a frequency divider using 
GaAs-based HEMT technology in the 
microwave and millimeter-wave regimes. 
  Until now, HEMT technology has played a 
chief role in microwave and millimeter-wave 
circuits. The advantages of HEMT transistors, 
such as large transconductance, great power 
density, low noise figure, and high breakdown 
voltage, as well as a semi-insulating GaAs 
substrate are favorable for circuits operating at 
high frequencies. Today, the HEMT 
technology retains the world record for the 
cut-off frequency and maximum operation 
frequency (about 500-GHz ft and about 
400-GHz fmax).  
Nowadays, many Gilbert mixers have been 
realized using CMOS and SiGe HBT 
technologies at the low-frequency wireless 
systems. A Gilbert mixer has the advantages 
such as higher conversion gain, compact size 
and good isolation. Recently, the advancement 
in silicon device scaling has made CMOS and 
SiGe HBT Gilbert mixers possible even at 
millimeter-wave frequencies. On the other 
hand, with an advanced technology, the 
modern wireless communication system 
moves to higher frequency. HEMT technology 
is usually adopted in the microwave and 
millimeter-wave regimes. The indium mole 
fraction is 15 - 30% and 40% for pHEMT and 
mHEMT devices provided by the standard 
foundry process, respectively. Thus, a 
0.15-μm InAlAs/InGaAs mHEMT technology 
has a 110-GHz cutoff frequency while a 
this project, SHMs w/ and w/o compensation 
are demonstrated using 0.15-μm mHEMT 
technology to validate the isolation 
improvement. 
On the other hand, an RFD consists of a 
mixer, an amplifier and a low-pass filter (LPF) 
or a band-pass filter (BPF) as shown in the 
dotted area in Fig 2. The RFD’s output (1/2 fin) 
is fed back to the mixer’s inputs (fin) and 
results in the 1/2 fin mixing at a mixer’s output. 
Other odd harmonic components (3/2fin, 
5/2fin ..) can be filtered away by an LPF or 
BPF. An RFD can achieve high speed, low 
power consumption, and low phase noise. In a 
direct conversion or low-IF systems, a 
frequency divider with quadrature outputs is 
usually needed. Papers about 
quadrature-output frequency dividers have 
been published. However, GaAs-based 
technology use the conventional microwave 
quarter-wavelength design concept for 
frequency dividers and thus the chip size is 
formidably large for the IC technology. 
Therefore, many GaAs-based dividers are 
usually differential outputs. Thus, in this 
project, the quadrature-output RFDs are 
demonstrated using 0.15-μm mHEMT and 
pHEMT technologies. The performance 
comparison of the two RFDs is also 
established. 
 
RESEARCH METHOD AND DISCUSSIONS 
(A) 17-GHz Single-Quadrature Down- 
Converter 
 
1. Operational Principle 
Figure 1 illustrates the functional block 
diagram of a SQDC with polyphase filters. 
The frequency of the input RF signal is 
denoted as RF LO IF    and the frequency 
of the image signal is denoted as 
IM LO IF    . The meaning of the single 
quadrature means that the RF signal is real 
while the LO signals are in the quadrature 
format.  
Two multipliers are employed to mix the RF 
signal and the image signal with the 
quadrature LO signals as shown in Fig. 2. 
There are totally 4 output IF signals resulting 
from the two multipliers. The differential 
quadrature IF signals consist of II+, IQ-, II- 
and IQ+ downconverted signals. Here, the 
first letter represents the constituent RF (IM) 
signal and the second letter represents the 
constituent LO signal for the composite IF 
signal. The 4 downconverted IF signals can be 
grouped into differential quadrature signals as 
summarized in Table I. In each group, the 
differential quadrature IF signals, II+, IQ-, II- 
and IQ+, are in the counter-clockwise (positive) 
sequence for the RFxLO mixing and in the 
clockwise (negative) sequence for the IMxLO 
mixing as shown in the Table I.

The positive IF sequence can be treated as a 
positive IF+ frequency, IFj te  ; while the 
negative IF sequence can be treated as a 
negative IF- frequency, IFj te  . Thus, a 
polyphase filter which can discriminate the 
positive frequency from the negative 
frequency as shown in Fig. 2 is employed to 
achieve image rejection. 
 
2. Mismatch effect on image rejection 
  Imperfect quadrature LO signals can be 
decomposed into an ideal sequence with an 
opposite error sequence as explained in 
reference.  The imperfections in quadrature 
LO signals can be caused by feeding the 
unbalanced signals to the mixer and the 
mismatches in the mixer itself. The image 
rejection ratio degrades when non-ideal effects 
occur. When mismatches such as gain and 
phase errors occur, it is equivalent to say that 
the false signals at the negative spectrum 
appear. Thus, the mismatched quadrature LO 
signal can be represented as the linear 
combination of an ideal signal, LOID ( LO
j te  ), 
and the error signal, LOER ( L Oj trE e  ),with

Polyphase filter

filters using depletion mode pHEMT technology. 
 
A perfect image rejection can be achieved 
only at a single IF frequency for a one-stage 
IF polyphase filter even though there is no 
mismatch in the mixers. However, if a certain 
IF bandwidth is specified, a multi-stage IF 
polyphase filter needs to be employed and a 
finite image rejection ratio occurs even though 
there is no mismatch effect in the mixers. 
There is a trade-off between the image 
rejection ratio and the IF bandwidth in 
designing a polyphase filter. If a larger IF 
bandwidth and a higher image rejection ratio 
are desired at the same time, there must be 
more sections of polyphase filters in cascade. 
The polyphase filter can be cascaded to 
improve quadrature accuracy and expand the 
bandwidth; however, the performances of the 
gain and the noise figure are degraded. At the 
output of the polyphase filters, the in-phase 
(anti-in-phase) and quadrature-phase (anti- 
quadrature-phase) terminals are connected 
together to form the differential IF signals as 
shown in Fig. 4. A differential buffer 
amplifier is also included in the IF final stage 
as shown in Fig. 4. The gain performance can 
be easily further improved by inserting several 
IF amplifiers into the polyphase filter chain. 
The prototype downconverter in this paper 
does not include this arrangement for the 
simplicity, but an IF output buffer amplifier is 
used at the end of the polyphase filters to 
provide some gain to compensate the loss of 
the IF polyphase filter.  
In this paper, the four-stage IF polyphase 
filter is designed to range from 10 to 90 MHz. 
The poles are located in a way to achieve a 
Butterworth response and the design renders a 
40 dB image rejection ratio. 
The microphoto of the pHEMT 
single-quadrature Gilbert down-conversion 
mixer with the LO and IF polyphase filters is 
shown in Fig. 5, and the die size is 2.3 
mm×1.6 mm. The layout just has two metal 
layers for routings in GaAs technology. 
Additionally, the transmission line at high 
frequencies must be considered as a portion of 
the mixer design and the layout is kept 
symmetrically for better performance. The 
high-frequency LO and RF signal paths must 
be kept equal, respectively. The equal-path 
signal can reduce phase mismatch. The 
line-to-line coupling effect is more 
pronounced especially at high frequencies. 
When the width of a transmission line is 
smaller, the line-to-line spacing must be kept 
about 25-um distance to reduce the coupling 
effect and for better performance. The current 
consumption of mixer cores is 39 mA at the 
supply voltage VDD of 5.5 V. The measured 
results are based on 50 Ω systems and 
on-wafer probes. All performances are 
measured at one port of differential outputs, 
and the other port is terminated by a 50 Ω load. 
When LO input power equals 6.7 dBm at 17 
GHz, the maximum conversion gain of the 
image rejection down-converter is about 5.5 
dB as shown in Fig. 6.

LO Power (dBm)  
Fig. 6 Conversion gain vs. LO power of the pHEMT 
Gilbert SQDC with polyphase filters  
5.2 dB loss. The subharmonic Gilbert mixer 
consists of subharmonic Gilbert cell (M1~M8), 
the IF input stage (M9~M10) and the current 
source (M11). A source resistor is used at the 
source of M11 for self-biasing the current 
source because only the depletion mode 
PHEMT devices are available. Thus, a 
single-voltage suppy for the upconverter is 
achieved. The differential quadrature signals 
needed by the subharmonic Gilbert cells 
(M1~M8) are generated by applying the 
differential signals to the two-stage polyphase 
filter. An external 180o hybrid balun is 
employed to generate the differential LO 
signals and differential IF signals, 
respectively. 
The inductors, L1 and L2, and a capacitor, 
C1, form an LC passive current combiner 
designed at 40 GHz (ω= 1/ 1,2 12L C ) at the RF 
output. An LC current combiner transforms 
the differential outputs of the sub-harmonic 
mixer into a single-ended output while 
doubling the voltage gain. In general, the 
performance of a passive LC current combiner 
at higher frequencies is superior to an active 
current mirror load because an active current 
mirror not only has a limited output voltage 
swing but also can not response rapidly at 
higher frequencies. Furthermore, a passive LC 
current combiner possesses good linearity. A 
short microstrip line with one end shorted is 
used as the inductor at 40 GHz. The 
microstrip line inductor has a good quality 
factor because GaAs-based technology has the 
backside ground plane and semi-insulating 
substrate. On the other hand, the high quality 
microstrip line inductor can not be realized in 
the Si-based technology because of the lack of 
the backside ground plane and the lossy 
silicon substrate.

  Figure 10 displays the micrograph of the 
fabricated chip in Fig. 9. The layout is kept as 
symmetric as possible and the IF+ and IF- 
inputs are located on the opposite sides for the 
sake of symmetry consideration. The chip size 
is 1.4 × 0.9 mm2 including pads. The supply 
voltage and total current is 4 V and 12.9 mA. 
When input LO power 9.5 dBm at IF = 0.1 
GHz and LO = 20 GHz, the peak conversion 
gain has -1 dB.

  The measured conversion gain versus RF 
frequency by fixing the LO frequency at 20 
GHz and sweeping the IF frequencies is 
shown in Fig. 11. The experimental RF 3-dB 
bandwidth is about 1.8 GHz ranging from 39 
GHz to 40.8 GHz and is limited by the LC 
current combiner and the associated output 
matching network. Meanwhile, in Fig. 12, the 
2LO-RF isolation is better than 40 dB for 37 ~ 
44 GHz LO frequencies and the IF-RF 
isolation is above 55 dB for 0.1 ~ 3 GHz IF 
frequencies. The LO-RF isolation is better 
than 40 dB for 19 ~ 20.5 GHz LO frequencies. 
The measured RF output return loss is shown 
 
Fig. 17 Die photo of the Q-band mHEMT sub-harmonic 
mixers with delay compensation. 
 
 
Fig. 18 Die photo of the Q-band mHEMT sub-harmonic 
mixers without delay compensation. 
 
  The schematic of Q-band SHMs w/ and w/o 
delay compensation is shown in Fig. 16. 
Ideally, the source node of a differential pair 
has large second-order harmonics as 
illustrated in Fig. 16; thus, the waveforms at 
the source nodes of the stacked-LO cores [Fig. 
15(a) and (b)] are out-of-phase at twice the 
LO frequency due to the 90° LO input phase 
difference at the bottom core. As a result, the 
two second-order harmonic terms can be 
cancelled if two circuits are in parallel. Thus, 
a higher 2LO-to-RF isolation is achieved. 
Similarly, the 2LO-to-IF isolation  is also 
improved because (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) LO 
leakage leaks to the same output and the 2LO 
frequency term can be cancelled as shown in 
Fig. 16. On the other hand, a double-balanced 
structure achieves better LO-to-RF/IF 
isolation performance than a single-balanced 
structure. However, any device mismatch may 
degrade the LO isolation. 
  Differential-quadrature LO signals are 
generated by a two-section polyphase filter 
from differential LO signals. Unlike the 
silicon-based technology, the GaAs-based 
technology has accurate thin-film resistors and 
metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors. 
Therefore, the polyphase filter can be 
implemented at around 20 GHz with much 
accuracy.  
  Additionally, all the dc biases of the 
following mixer cores are fed from 2-kΩ 
resistors. On the other hand, an RF Marchand 
balun is used before common-gate 
configurations to generate differential signals 
as shown in Fig. 16. The dc ground of the 
mixer core is fed from the Marchand balun. 
  Die photos of the SHMs w/ and w/o delay 
compensation are shown in Fig. 17 and Fig. 
18 with the die sizes of 2.5×2 mm2 and 2×1.5 
mm2, respectively. The supply voltage of each 
SHM is 7 V with the current consumption of 
12 mA in mixer core, respectively.  
Fig. 16 Schematic of the Q-band mHEMT sub-harmonic mixers w/ and w/o delay compensation. 
compensation is 41/29 dB at fLO=19.5/21 GHz, 
respectively. That is, a 12-dB improvement is 
achieved. Besides, the 2LO-to-RF is 37/32 dB 
and RF-to-IF isolation is 32/27 dB for the 
SHMs w/ and w/o compensation as shown in 
Fig. 22(b) and (c), respectively.

Although the division bandwidth becomes 
narrow, the supply voltage can be reduced by 
a passive LC tank. The inductor based on a 
short high-impedance microstrip transmission 
line has a high quality and is adopted here

CONCLUSION 
In this project, we have demonstrated an 
SQDC image-rejection receiver, a 40-GHz 
sub-harmonic up-converter, Q-band sub- 
harmonic down-converter w/ and w/o delay 
compensation, and a divide-by-two quadrature 
RFD. The following are the performance 
summary of all the circuits. 
 
(A) 17-GHz Single-Quadrature Down- 
Converter 
For the first time to the best of our 
knowledge, a 17-GHz SQDC is demonstarted. 
From 10-MHz to 90-MHz IF frequencies, a 
30-dB image rejection ratio is achieved when 
RF and LO frequencies are designed around 
17 GHz. The Gilbert SQDC has a 5.5-dB 
conversion gain, 0-dBm IP1dB, and 16-dBm 
IIP3.  
 
(B) 40-GHz Sub-Harmonic Up-Converter 
  The demonstrated PHEMT subharmonic 
Gilbert upconverter has a conversion gain of 
-1 dB, an output return loss of -16.5 dB at 40 
GHz, LO-RF isolation of 47 dB, and 2LO-RF 
isolation of 41 dB. OP1dB and OIP3 are -20 
dBm and -5 dBm, respectively.  The current 
consumption is 12.9 mA at a 4 V supply 
voltage. 
 
(C) Q-Band Sub-Harmonic Down-Converter 
w/ and w/o Delay Compensation 
SHMs w/ and w/o compensation achieve 
the conversion gain of 1/0.5 dB and noise 
figure of 23/20 dB when 2fLO=39/42 GHz. 
However, the compensation circuit improves 
the 2LO-to-RF isolation by 12 dB, 2LO-to-IF 
isolation by 5 dB and RF-to-IF isolation by 5 
dB without additional power consumption. 
 
(D) Divide-by-Two Quadrature Regenerative 
Frequency Divider 
The demonstrated 22~26-GHz pHEMT 
quadrature RFD consumes 28.4 mA at the 
supply voltage of 7 V while the 36.5~ 
38.1-GHz mHEMT one consumes 16.9 mA at 
the supply voltage of 6V. The mHEMT divider 
has lower current consumption, high speed 
operation and output power as compared to 
the pHEMT divider. The outcomes offer 
another choice — the mHEMT analog circuit 
design approach in the fully integrated 
millimeter-wave regime.

二、 心得（可含照片） 
此會議之與會人士雖然人數不多，但兩天的議程卻相當緊湊，包含了微波領域之最新技
術之論文發表，以及請到知名之專家演說，可以藉此觀察及吸收到目前世界上微波領域的最
新發展。 
不過有一點可以看得出來，各個地區或國家有不同的研究發展目標及方向，例如在主動
電路方面幾乎被台灣所包辦，這當然要感謝台積電(TSMC)和國家晶片系統設計中心(CIC)給
予整個學術界下免費 IC的機會，而台灣區另一大宗則是被動電路的實作。現在西方國家也比
較偏向實際應用方面的研究。吾人認為，若是要讓研究的深度更加深，基礎的理論一定得再
加強，這樣研究的路才能走得更長更久。 
以下為吾人於會議上展示海報時所拍攝之照片：
