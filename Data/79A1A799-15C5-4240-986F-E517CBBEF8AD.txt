maintain sound goodwill, enterprises generally conduct product quality restriction prior to 
sales, while at the same time setting out procedures for defective products. Salameh and 
Jaber (2000) considered the EOQ model with the existence of defective products, and 
conducted product inspection for all goods, in which the defective products discovered, 
will be sold at a lower price. Chan et al. (2003) in turn conducted product inspection for all 
goods under the EPQ model, and treated imperfect and defective goods by selling them at a 
lower price, reworking or rejecting. Chiu (2003) considered the EPQ model where 
inventory shortage is allowed, and assumed defective products will be produced randomly, 
where part of which can be reworked and part of which disposed, thereby determining the 
optimal production quantity and the level of inventory shortage. Papachristos and 
Konstantaras (2006) used Salameh and Jaber (2000) as the foundation, investigating that 
defective products are sold only when good products in the batch are all sold. Chiu (2007) 
assumed defective products will be produced randomly, which can either be written off or 
repaired. The repair process can also incur expenses for where a certain proportion of 
goods will be written off. Other research relating to treatment of defective goods in 
production/order strategy can be referenced to Kulkarni (2008), Sarker et al. (2008), Jaber 
et al. (2009), El Saadany and Jaber (2010). 
Regardless of whether the above academics investigated the EPQ or EOQ model, 
their focus was on the treatment of production of defective products, and decided the 
optimal production/order quantity. As to the process of product quality restriction, all 
researches assumed no error in the inspection process, i.e. that products that are deemed 
good products after inspection, are in fact good products; products that are deemed 
defective after inspection, are in fact defective products. The inspection process however 
involves human factor, equipment obsolescence or technical constraints and so on, 
resulting in inspection errors. In practice, quality restriction often mistakenly treat good 
products as defective ones (Type I inspection error), or treat defective products as good 
ones (Type II inspection error). Recently, some academics have incorporated such 
inspection error into inventory models, to investigate the effect of inspection error on 
production quantity and total cost. For example, Yoo et al. (2009) established a 
profit-maximizing EPQ model that incorporates both imperfect production quality and 
inspection errors. Khan et al. (2011) extended the work of Salameh and Jaber (2000) and 
suggested an EOQ model with imperfect quality and inspection errors. 
Competition between enterprises nowadays and the rise of consumer consciousness 
of protecting their rights, has led to increased attention to raising quality inspection

According to the above description and assumptions, the retailer’s total profit per

It is not easy to find the closed-form solutions of Q  and β  from Equations (2) and (3), 
simultaneously. Besides, due to the high-power expression of the exponential function for 
the demand rate, the concavity property of the total profit per unit time ( , )Q βΠ  in 
Equation (1) cannot easily be proved by using the Hessian matrix. Instead, we solve the 
problem by using the following search procedure.

5.  SOLUTION PROCEDURES 
To obtain the optimal solution ),( ** βQ  for the proposed model, we use the 
 10
transportation cost f =$500/ shipment and the freight rate schedule is offered as Table 3. 
Table 3. The freight rate schedule 
ε Q (units/ship) εγ ($/unit) 
1 0 ≤ Q < 1800 0.9 
2 1800 ≤ Q < 3600 0.85 
3 3600 ≤ Q < 7200 0.8 
4 7200 ≤ Q   0.75 
Example 1. The decision process can be performed by taking n =500 and using the 
algorithm proposed in Section 5 to obtain the optimal solution. The results are as follows: 
the optimal ordering quantity,  43
*Q Qβ= = 3688.03 units, optimal market demand 
== − )1(043 43)( βδβ eDD 5391.08 units/year, the power of the test  =− )1( *β  9948.00052.01 =−  
and the corresponding freight rate == 3γγ ε $0.8/unit. Employing this optimal policy into 
Equation (1), we further have the maximum total profit, =Π ),( ** βQ  
 43 43
( , )Qβ βΠ = $28293.79/year. To see the effects of inspection power improvement, using 
Equation (5), we can easily obtain the results of the fixed inspection power model (i.e., 
0ββ = =0.06): =D 5303.11 units/year and =*Q  3656.77 units. Taking this optimal 
policy into Equation (1), we further have the maximum total profit, 
0
*( , 0.06)Q βΠ = =$27893.02/year. By comparing the results, we can see that increasing 
annual market demand and total profit are achieved from the effort of inspection quality 
improvement.  
 
Example 2. In this example we perform a sensitivity analysis with respect to some 
important parameters 0D , 0β ,δ , ρ  and λ  to investigate their effects on the optimal 
policy (including *β , *Q , *( )D β and ),( ** βQΠ ). The data used is the same as those in 
Example 1. To explore every situation, a sensitivity analysis is conducted by changing each 
of the parameters by the appropriate value taking one parameter at a time while all the 
other parameters remain unchanged. The results are shown in Table 4. The final column in 
this table shows the percentage increase in total profits compared with Example 1 when the 
parameters are employed.

accuracy of the product inspection result in promoting profit for the retailer. On the other 
hand, the total profits decrease with the increases in the original proportion of Type II 
inspection error 0β , fractional opportunity cost ρ  or defective rate λ . However, the 
sensitivities of the three parameters are slight. From economical viewpoint, if the retailer 
determines to invest capital for improving its quality of product inspection, the optimal 
order and investment policies will be weekly influenced by the values of 0β , ρ , and λ  
though all of them have negative impacts on total profit. 
7.  CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH 
 In this study we consider an EOQ model, in the circumstance of defective goods in 
inward purchases, where the retailer will undergo quality restriction, and assume that the 
inspection results to contain Type I and Type II errors. To increase the power of the test, the 
retailer will invest in the quality of product inspection to reduce the proportion of 
substandard goods from reaching consumers. The total profit function per unit time for the 
retailer is established. We first employ mathematical analysis to find the retailer’s optimal 
order quantity for given the power of the test, and then an algorithm is designed to find the 
optimal solution which maximizes the total profit function. Finally, numerical examples 
are used to explain the solution finding process, and a sensitivity analysis for the main 
parameters is conducted to understand the effects of main parameters on the solution.  
 The proposed model can be extended and further examined in several ways. Some 
suggestions include manipulating the proposed inventory model to consider stochastic 
rather than deterministic inspection errors, defective rate and/or market demand.
