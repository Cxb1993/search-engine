Abstract  
In this study, adsorption of ammonia (NH3) onto coal activated carbons modified 
with H2SO4 impregnation was investigated. Experiment results showed that after H2SO4 
impregnation, the physical properties of coal activated carbons changed, dry weight 
increased, pore volume decreased,  pore size increased, and Brunauer-Emment-Teller 
(BET) surface area decreased by corrosion of acid. Those phenomena are 
disadvantageous to physisorption occurrence. 
A dynamic continuous adsorption system is used to measure the adsorption of NH3 
onto activated carbon, with inflow of 50 ml/L, 1% NH3. The adsorption capacity was 
presented by breakage point (as saturation terminal point). The original saturation 
adsorbing time was 2.23 min, but with H2SO4 impregnation it increased to 535.09 
minutes, which was 240 times raised under optimal modification conditions with 3 M 
H2SO4, 80 oC and 3 hours impregnation. Besides, the surface functional groups were 
determined with Fourier transfer infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The occurrence of 
chemisorption due to the interaction between ammonia and some oxygen functional 
groups via hydrogen bonding and acid-baser reaction was confirmed. Additionally, the 
white powder in column was thought as (NH3)2SO4. Therefore, the formation of 
sediments was another mechanism for removal of NH3.

人才培育預估與達成情形下表。原預定培育兩位碩士班學生，因其
中一位中途休學，僅有一位順利畢業，目前任職於惠民的實業股份有限
公司，擔任鳳山溪汙水處理廠的廠長。就讀本校碩士前，該生原任職於
皇田股份有限公司，負責檢測活性碳成品的物理特性，如強度、酸鹼度
及吸附能利。碩士研讀期間的訓練，配合精密儀器的檢測，使該生得以
在既有的領域，更深入的探討，從以前的單純規律性的操作人員，變成
具有思考能力，遇困難不退縮，勇於面對，這些強項讓他足以勝任目前
的工作，也深得公司高層的賞識。另外，兩位大學部的專題生，參與本
計畫的過程，主要負責資料的蒐集與彙整及活性碳前處理的試驗，目前
兩位學生皆服役中。兩位學生經由參與本研究計畫，培養實驗的規劃與
