二、緣由與目的 
擠壓為食品工業上常用的加工技術，具有將
原料加熱、烹煮並成型為最終產品的功能，其製
程中結合了混合、加熱、剪切、組織化、成型及
乾燥等多項單元操作，同時也可視為一種高溫短
時間的食品製程（HTST Food process）（鍾 
1998）。常見擠壓食品包括早餐穀類、休閒點心
食品、組織化大豆蛋白及寵物食品等（周 2007；
Ding et al 2005；Lin et al. 2002）。 
大豆是食品擠壓加工常用的原料之一，大豆
屬於豆科植物，含有豐富之蛋白質、油脂、卵磷
脂、纖維素、皂素、異黃酮類等（Luthria et al. 
2007），為高營養價值的食物。其加工品種類很
多，如：大豆油、豆漿、豆腐、納豆、醬油（黃 
2007）。而存在於大豆與大部分的大豆食品中的
異黃酮類（Isoflavones）為植物化合物，屬於植物
雌激素，被認為可以預防癌症、骨質疏鬆症、減
緩更年期障礙與降低人體中膽固醇等數種促進健
康的功能（Lee et al. 2005）。由於異黃酮結構類
似雌性激素（Estrogen），而且是一種強力的抗氧
化劑，可避免人體中脂質、蛋白質及染色體遭受
活性氧的攻擊，亦可掃除體內過多的自由基，避
免人體遭活性氧破壞各油脂間之過氧化物、輻射
線、化學污染等（王 2002；Fritz et al. 2003）。 
以擠壓加工技術生產 TSP 時，原料中的大豆
蛋白質會因為擠壓過程中所提供的壓力、溫度、
剪切力等而發生水合、變性與熔化作用，使得氫
鍵、雙硫鍵與離子鍵斷裂，造成原料的結構瓦解
形成融熔狀態而具有可塑性，並在擠壓機模口處
形成具有方向性的層狀結構，最後物料由高溫高
壓狀態瞬間進入常壓環境中，因此釋放大量過熱
蒸氣，使得產品形成膨鬆與多孔狀的纖維般結構
（王 1999）。而不同的原料對最終 TSP 產品具
有不同的影響，在 Lin 等（2002）研究中更指出
加工參數、質地及微細結構（Microstructure）與 
TSP 的感官特性有關。而如以大豆蛋白質作為原
料，則以脫脂大豆蛋白與大豆分離蛋白為最適
當，前者因含有50%蛋白質而利於組織化的形成，
而後者因除去碳水化合物而使得蛋白質比例提
高，因此亦適合作為組織化的原料。 
除蛋白質外，澱粉亦是擠壓加工常用的原料
之一，天然澱粉是一種葡萄糖聚合的碳水化合
物，以葡萄糖 α1-4與 β1-6分別形成直鏈澱粉
（Amylose）與支鏈澱粉（Amylopectin）兩種不同
型式所組成之同元聚合物（Haralampu 2000；Liu et 
al. 2005；Eerlingen and Delcour 1995；Keetles et al. 
1996； Shamai et al. 2003）。直鏈澱粉與支鏈澱
粉 的 基 本 結 構 相 同 ， 皆 為 由 α-D- 葡 萄 糖
（α-D-Glucose）所葡萄糖聚合而成（Eerlingen and 
Delcour 1995；Kohyama et al. 2004）。在一般天然
澱粉中直鏈澱粉約佔25%，依來源不同，直鏈澱粉
含量仍會有所差異（Tang et al. 2002），如米澱粉
的直鏈澱粉含量約為 17%，而小麥與玉米澱粉
（Maize starch）則約為 28%（Jenlins and Donald 
1995；Matveev et al. 2001），高直鏈玉米澱粉中
的直鏈澱粉含量更可達50%以上，不同的直鏈澱粉
與支鏈澱粉比例則可能會造成加工特性上的差
異。而直鏈澱粉可能會與脂質等物質形成複合
物，而影響澱粉理化性質（Godet et al. 1995；Jenlins 
and Donold 1995）。當原料中存有澱粉時，在水分
與溫度皆足夠的條件下，澱粉分子於擠壓過程中
將會發生糊化作用（Gelatinization）（Hagenimana 
et al. 2006）。Nelles（2000）提及澱粉糊化過程中
如可賦予剪切作用（Shear），則澱粉顆粒會被破
壞並成糊，而如未賦予剪切作用，則加工溫度需
超過120℃，澱粉顆粒才會完成溶解。而當原料中
同時存有蛋白質與澱粉並同時進行加工時，則可
能會使蛋白質與澱粉發生交互作用而形成複合物
（Walter et al. 2005；Sagum and Arcot 2000），進
而改變擠壓產品的品質。 
大豆中含有豐富的油脂與蛋白質，自古以來
就被亞洲人民視為至寶，加工開發出多種食品。
素肉又稱人造肉，可以擠壓加工黃豆粉的方式來
製作，品質好產量高。然而，黃豆在浸泡與研磨
後，所產生之特殊豆味，對許多人造成攝食上的
影響。澱粉可被用作是結著劑，米穀粉中除含豐
富的米澱粉外，亦有特殊的米香氣，米基本上分
為在來米、稉米與糯米。澱粉中像是玉米澱粉、
馬鈴薯澱粉與樹薯澱粉都是食品加工上常用的原
料。在思考機能性組織化大豆蛋白(TSP)目前的發
展後，後學於是提案「添加不同米穀粉、澱粉與
全脂黃豆粉對組織化大豆蛋白理化與機能性質的
影響之研究」。希望以兩年的時間，完成TSP最適
米穀、澱粉與全脂大豆粉添加的研究。 
三、結果與討論 
1. 理化性質分析 
1.1 水分滯留率 
表一、表二與圖一、圖二為添加不同含量(5
％與 10％)的米穀粉(秈米、稉米與糯米)與澱粉種
類(馬鈴薯澱粉、高直鏈玉米澱粉與玉米澱粉)於
TSP 中之水分滯留率結果，在表一中顯示添加不
同米穀粉與含量都有極為顯著的差異，且從圖一
中顯示出添加 TCW70 含量為 10％時則有最高的
水分滯留率，於添加 TCS17 含量為 5％時有最低
的水分滯留率。而表二中顯示當添加不同澱粉與
含量都會對水分滯留率有極為顯著的影響，於圖
二中顯示添加 5％澱粉有比添加 10％澱粉還要高
的水分滯留率，當添加馬鈴薯澱粉 5％時有最高的
水分滯留率，當添加高直鏈玉米澱粉 10％時則會
有最低的水分滯留率的現象。陳(2006)與馮(2009)
製作組織化大豆蛋白後之水份滯留率有較本研究
之結果來的低，原因可能是本研究中有添加米穀
粉與澱粉增加組織化大豆蛋白於擠壓加工時對水
分的保水性，且在林(1992)將澱粉添加於火腿中有
助於改善製程後之火腿有更好的保水能力。 
1.2 色差值 
 表三~表八與圖三~圖八為添加不同含量(5％
與 10％)的米穀粉(秈米、稉米與糯米)與澱粉(馬鈴
薯澱粉、高直鏈玉米澱粉與玉米澱粉)於 TSP 中之
色差值結果，從表三中 L 值結果顯示當添加不同
米穀粉會有極為顯著的差異，但在添加不同含量
之米穀粉則對 L 值無顯著影響，且從圖三中顯示
添加 TK9 之米穀粉有較高之 L 值，而添加 TCS17
之米穀粉組別則是有較低之 L 值現象，其結果與
簡(2010)相同。在表四中 a 值結果顯示當添加不同
米穀粉與含量時會有極為顯著的差異，且從圖四
中顯示當米穀粉添加 10％有高於添加 5％米穀粉
之組別，盧於 1991 年提到當製作麵條時增加澱粉
的含量 a 值也會隨之上升，與本研究有相同結果，
其中以含有 10％的 TCS17 有最高的 a 值，而含有
 4
(Onset Temperature;To)、糊化與變性尖峰溫度
(Peak Temperature;Tp) 及 糊 化 與 變 性 熱 焓 值
(Enthalpy; △H))結果都有極顯著差異，且從表十六
中可觀察到有兩個尖峰溫度，其造成兩個尖峰溫
度是因為大豆蛋白中含有不同的蛋白質成分 2S、
7S、11S、15S，其含量以 7S 與 11S 含量分別為
35％及 52％（Barać et al. 2004），而兩種球蛋白
含量較多，且變性溫度也不同，所以，在分析組
織化大豆蛋白混料會產生兩個尖峰溫度，而形成
有不同熱變性溫度(Hua et al. 2005)。表十六中 To
為添加 TCW70 之米穀粉為最高，當添加 TK9 之
米穀粉時則有較低之現象，在 Tp1 與 Tp2 分別為
TCW70 含 10％及 5％有最高的 Tp，而 TK9 含 10
％及 TCS17 含 5％則有最低的 Tp，於△H1 與△H2
則是分別以 TCS17 含 10％及 TCW70 含 10％有最
高的△H，而 TCW70 含 5％與 TK9 含 5％組別有
較低的△H，且從△H 上可看到當米穀粉含量增加
時其△H 也會隨之上升，因此可推測當蛋白質與
米穀粉混合加熱會使蛋白質與米穀粉有相融的現
象產生。由表十八為經 ANOVA 分析之結果可看
出，添加不同澱粉與含量於組織化大豆蛋白的混
料利用熱分析儀分析 To、Tp 與△H 結果均有極顯
著性的差異，且可從表十九中看到以添加 HAM 含
5％組別有最高的 To，而添加馬鈴薯澱粉組別則有
較低的結果，在 Tp1 與 Tp2 為 HAM 含 10％組別
最高，而馬鈴薯澱粉含 10％與 HAM 含 5%之組別
則有較低之表現，於△H1 及△H2 結果則是以玉米
澱粉含 10％與 HAM 含 5％組別為最高，而 HAM
含 5％與馬鈴薯澱粉含 10％組別則較低，Singh et 
al. (2003)曾經提到不同來源的植物澱粉會有不同
的結構，使得利用熱分析儀分析後會有不同熱性
質的表現。 
2. 機能性質分析 
2.1 大豆異黃酮分析 
 表十九~二十二為添加不同米穀粉與澱粉對
組織化大豆蛋白大豆異黃酮含量分析之結果。由
表十九中可得知添加米穀粉之組別在添加不同米
種與含量上都有極顯著性差異的大豆異黃酮
(Glucosides、Malonylglucosides、Acetylglucosides、
Aglycones 與 Total isoflavone)含量，從表二十數據
結果可看出添加 TCW70 米穀粉之組別有最高的
總異黃酮含量，由此結果推論可能是因為米穀粉
並非純澱粉，當中的 TCW70 米穀粉可能比其它米
榖粉含有較多的異黃酮，所以造成與其他米穀粉
之組別有顯著性差異。而從表二十一為添加不同
澱粉對組織化大豆蛋白之相關性分析，其分析結
果為添加不同澱粉及含量上對組織化大豆蛋白之
異 黃 酮 (Glucosides 、 Malonylglucosides 、
Acetylglucosides、Aglycones 與 Total isoflavone)的
含量都有極為顯著的相關，且從表二十二當中可
發現添加 5％澱粉之組織化大豆蛋白皆有高於添
加 10％澱粉的組織化大豆蛋白的異黃酮含量，其
中則以添加 HAM 澱粉之組別有最高的異黃酮趨
勢，可能造成此趨勢的原因，在於 HAM 澱粉中可
能含有比其它澱粉還高量的異黃酮，而造成有此
現象產生。而此結果之含量與林(2009)之添加大豆
胚軸粉於組織化大豆蛋白實驗中的控制組有類似
含量之結果。 
2.2 還原力分析 
表二十三、表二十四與圖十五、圖十六為添加不
同含量(5％與 10％)的米穀粉(秈米、稉米與糯米)
與澱粉(馬鈴薯澱粉、高直鏈玉米澱粉與玉米澱粉)
於 TSP 中之還原力結果。從表二十三中可得知當
添加不同米穀粉與含量時對組織化大豆蛋白的還
原能力有極顯著影響，圖十五中顯示添加 TK9 米
穀粉 5％之組別有最高的還原能力，但添加 TCS17
米穀粉 5％則有較低的還原能力之結果。在於組織
化大豆蛋白添加澱粉對於還原力之影響，只有在
添加不同含量的澱粉時有顯著差異顯示於表二十
四，並且可從圖十六中看到添加 10％澱粉之組別
有高於添加 5％之組別的還原能力。 
2.3 清除 DPPH 自由基清除能力分析 
表二十五、表二十六與圖十七、圖十八為添加不
同含量(5％與 10％)的米穀粉(秈米、稉米與糯米)
與澱粉(馬鈴薯澱粉、高直鏈玉米澱粉與玉米澱粉)
於 TSP 中自由基清除能力之結果。於組織化大豆
蛋白添加米穀粉組別由表示出當添加不同的種類
的米穀粉與含量都會造成組織化大豆蛋白對自由
機清除能力有極為顯著的結果，且從圖十七中顯
示添加 10％的米穀粉有高於添加 5％米穀粉的自
由基清除能力，其中以 TCS17 有最高的清除能
力，而 TCW70 則有最低的清除能力。而在添加澱
粉之組別也與添加米穀粉組別相同，不管在添加
不同澱粉的種類或含量上都有極顯著影響，但從
圖十八中可得知在添加 5％的澱粉有大於添加 10
％的自由基清除能力，其結果與米穀粉組別有相
反之結果，但在馬鈴薯澱粉則無顯著差異。 
2.4 抗性澱粉含量分析 
利用機壓機高溫與製作高水分之組織化大豆
白，使當中澱粉糊化，澱粉經糊化後則會產生回
凝，此回凝現象則會形成抗性澱粉，而抗性澱粉
為無法讓小腸消化吸收，但可以被腸道中的微生
物發酵利用的澱粉，有類似膳食纖維之生理性質。 
 表二十七、表二十八與圖十九、圖二十為為
添加不同含量(5％與 10％)的米穀粉(秈米、稉米與
糯米)與澱粉(馬鈴薯澱粉、高直鏈玉米澱粉與玉米
澱粉)於 TSP 中之抗性澱粉結果，從表二十七中結
果顯示當添加不同含量的米穀粉有極為顯著的差
異，且從圖十九可看到 TCW70 含 5％與 TK9 含
10％組別有最高的抗性澱粉含量，其中 TCW70 含
5％之組別經總澱粉實驗發現此組別有比其它組
別還高的澱粉含量，所以導致抗性澱粉有較高的
趨勢，在表二十八中顯示當 TSP 中添加不同澱粉
與含量時都會有極顯著之差異，且從圖二十中顯
示當澱粉含量增加到 10％時候有顯著的高於添加
5％澱粉之組別，其中以添加 10％的馬鈴薯澱粉與
玉米澱粉有最高之抗性澱粉，而添加 5％之高直鏈
玉米澱粉與馬鈴薯澱粉有較低之抗性澱粉的結
果。 
3.結構分析 
3.1 電子顯微鏡之觀察 
圖二十一~二十四藉由電子顯微鏡觀察添加不同
米穀粉與澱粉對組織化大豆蛋白之結構之差異，
經電子顯微鏡放大2mm時可看到添加10％米穀粉
的組織化大豆蛋白有比添加 5％米穀粉的組織化
大豆蛋白有比較平滑，且在添加 10％的 TK9 米穀
粉的組織化大豆蛋白中間有少許孔洞，再放大到
50μm後可以觀察到添加米穀粉之組織化大豆蛋白
其內部組織結構有比較平滑的現象，但在添加 10
％的 TK9 米穀粉的組織化大豆蛋白內部結構則有

一、參加會議經過 
 在今年三月時聽聞 6 月 17~18 在泰國曼谷將有國際會議 Food Innovation Aisa 
Conference 要舉行，於是在經過多次與大會負責稿約的 Ekasit Onsaard 博士連繫，首
先將論文摘要寄付審查、然後全文審查，最後到大會論文集的定稿。做好了這些準
備工作，最後才在 6/16 上午 9:10 搭乘中華航空(CI 931)由高雄出發，經香港轉中華
航空(CI 641)於下午 13:35 抵達曼谷的素汪那普國際機場，原本想搭乘大眾運輸工具
到市區，但在偌大的機場有點分不清東西南北，最後還是藉由機場的計程車服務，
驅車前往下榻的 Golden Pearl Residences，該旅館不僅網路上的評論很好，且距離開
會的 BITEC 不遠，缺點是沒有餐飲服務。車行了半小時才抵達旅館，卸下行囊、稍
微休息片刻後，才開始熟悉旅館的環境，沒有多久，去年曾交換到台灣的泰國學生
Porawon Nitjarunkul 已趕到旅館，還帶來泰國本地的香花與水果，由她帶領我去了市
區的 Siam Paragon，由她介紹泰國本地的食物料理做為晚餐，但由我來買單，晚餐上
聽聽她目前的近況，她已有準備接受泰國政府的獎學金到美國繼續研究所的學業，
也聊到她曾去過美國密蘇里大學的過往。晚餐後，在百貨公司地下室的超市買了些
點心、水與水果，然後告別 Porawon 後，就獨自搭 BTS 回 On Nut，再褡計程車回旅
館。 
 17 日一早六點就起床，再次確認會議報告所需要的資料，然後簡單用餐後，在
七點半時，始著裝完畢才下去旅館大廳等後計程車前往 BITEC，路上只見相反方向
有很大的車潮要進城，果真見識到曼谷的交通問題。抵達大會的會場 BITEC 的二樓，
大約七點五十分左右，已見到工作人員在現場開始忙碌起來，前往註冊服務部門報
到，並領取大會的文件資料，先找個座位坐下瀏覽資料，然後先前往壁報展覽區張
 4
大學負責籌辦。會議在泰國近郊的 BITEC (Bangkok International Trade and Exhibition 
Center)舉行。 
此次會議的主題有以下七個： 
- Indigenous food with high market potential 
- Industrial process development of indigenous food 
- Food safety issue of indigenous food 
- Nutrition quality and health benefit of indigenous food 
- Sensory and consumer research on indigenous food 
- Halal indigenous food 
- Other food related agro-industry 
 共計有兩天上午的大會演講與七場分組的口頭論文發表會與七組的壁報論文張
貼在會場，總計國際與泰國本地與會參加之專家學者約近兩百人。 
 個人除了兩篇壁報論文發表外，17 日下午在有一場口頭論文發表，該分組發表
會的主題是 Nutrition quality and health benefit of indigenous food，由中國浙江大學的
李鐸教授與澳洲 CSIRO 資深研究員 Dr. Izabela Konczak 主持，總計有十場報告，個
人排在第四位，報告有關添加大豆胚軸粉以增加組織化大豆蛋白機能性方面的研究
成果。 
 18 日上午大會安排 David Lyon 針對本地與非本地消費者對本地食品的品質與感
官與消費者的測定接受性發表演講，David 已在感官分析上工作超過 25 年，曾在
Campden & Chorleywood Food Research Association 服務過，領導團隊開發新的應用
方法在感官測試上，目前他為著名公司 Firmennich 在日內瓦全球感官分析主任，帶
領在瑞士、英國、新加坡、美國與巴西各地感官隊伍。另一位大會所安排的講者是
加拿大 McGill 大學的 Prof. Dr. Hosahalli S. Ramaswamy，他演講的主題在藉由人員教
育訓練減少本地食物收穫後損失以確保食物安全，他以該校與衣索匹亞過去合作的
 6
 在下午將近四點左右，與會的人員逐漸離去，我也獨自準備將張貼兩天的壁報
收拾起來，不過有點困難，因為此次大會是以雙面膠的方式來固定壁報，所以撕下
來的壁報背面會有膠帶，還好附近恰巧有某泰國大學的學生在集合，其中有位女同
學很熱心主動地來幫我收拾，她為泰國做了很好的國民外交，離去時我不僅向她道
謝也衷心祝福她。 
 19 日上午，與泰國學生 Porawon Nitjarunkul 約定在旅館附近施捨食物給泰國和
尚，順便到臨近的泰國社區走走，以了解泰國當地的民俗風情。稍後另一位泰國學
生 Pratya Nantapatavee 也來相會，身處異域的我，內心當然覺得很開心。其實在他們
分別造訪屏科大學習時，個人都很盡心盡力地指導他們的學習，以及關懷他們在屏
科大的生活，但卻不曾想過要他們回報。而此次會在來到泰國後，反過來被他們關
懷，心裏當然會有點激動，表示個人過去的努力得到國際學生的肯定。 
 在與 Porawon Nitjarunkul 道別後，Pratya Nantapatavee 陪同我前往素汪那普國際
機場。在 12:20pm 搭乘中華航空(CI 834)直飛桃園國際機場，於下午 17:00 抵達，再
轉搭高鐵回轉南台灣，結束了這次出國參加國際會議的旅程。 
 
二、與會心得 
 俗話說「要怎麼收穫、就要怎麼栽」，此次出國開會，更有深刻的體認。今天的
國際情勢，專家學者來來去去，很多時候在台灣也會與許多國際知名的專家學者碰
面、接觸與交流，也應該把握機會多與他們溝通，如果有朝一日在國際場合再度碰
面，自然是非常、非常高興的一件事。我想在國際間學術的交流，亦跳脫不了學者

ABSTRACT 
 
Textured soybean protein (TSP), with meat-like texture, was produced by the 
mixing, heating, shearing, pressuring and texturization inside a single-screw extruder 
with pre-formulated soybean flour. Stach has been used for the improvement of the 
texture of foods. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate effect of 
addition different starch and rice flour on the physical properties of TSP. The results 
revealed that addition of the Indica rice (TCS 17) flour 10% had the highest cooking 
loss. Regardless of addition of starch or rice flour, TSP made of 10% of adding 
amount would have higher cooking loss comparing to that made of 5% adding amount. 
TSP made of the addition of glutinous rice (TCW 70) flour 10% had the highest 
moisture retention, whereas TSP made of the addition of high amylose corn starch 
10% had the lowest moisture retention. As to the texture results of TSP, the addition 
of high amylose maize starch 10% had the highest cutting force, whereas the addition 
of TCW 70 rice flour 5% had the lowest cutting force. Therefore, the addition of 
different starch and rice flour had a significant (p<0.05) effect on e textural properties 
of TSP.

Introduction 
 
Extrusion technology in food science and technology is so important in the 
world, the reason lies in nothing more than continuous production process can replace 
the conventional batch production of complex process, while more diverse, high 
energy, low-cost and without waste and many other advantages (Ding 2005; 
Hagenimana et al. 2006). Textured soybean protein (TSP), commonly known as man-
made meat or vegetarian meat, is made from soy protein as the main raw material and 
uses extrusion technology to produce meat analog (Lin et al. 2002). 
Starch from various plant sources, such as corn, potato, wheat, and rice, have 
received extensive attention in relation to structural and physico-chemical properties 
(Singh et al. 2003). Natural starches are amylose and amylopectin, composed by the 
same basic structure, the α-D-glucose of the polymerization (Eerlingen and Delcour 
1995; Kohyama et al. 2004). Rice starch contains about 90% of the rice dry weight, 
while the amylose content is 0-33%. Varying in rice varieties in relation with its grain 
quality characteristics usually can be divided into Japonica, Indica and glutinous rice 
(Kuo 2006). The occurrence of interaction between protein and starch will form a 
complex and change the quality of extruded products (Walter et al. 2005; Sagum and 
Arcot 2000). In this study, we added a different starch and rice flour to textured 
soybean protein and investigated the moisture retention, cutting force and cooking 
loss of textured soybean protein products.

71.64%. Therefore, the absorbent powder of the product was a good water retention 
caused by the higher rate results.  
 
2 Cutting force 
The effects of different type of starch and the content on the cutting force of TSP 
(Table 2) were very significant (p<0.001). In Figure 2, the corn starch had very 
significant different with HAM starch and potato starch at p<0.05, but for the rice 
flour were not significant difference. Figure 2 showed that adding starch TSP was 
higher than the rice flour of TSP and significantly difference at p<0.05; and the 
addition of 10% of the starch and rice flour was higher than that of 5% and 
significantly difference at p<0.05. 
 
3 Cooking loss 
The results of ANOVA of adding different starch and rice flour on the cooking loss of 
TSP was shown in Table 3. The starch and rice flour with different levels of different 
types had significantly difference at p<0.001. In Figure 3, maize starch showed the 
lowest cooking loss and HAM starch had the highest phenomenon. For the group of 
the rice flour, the cooking loss of TK 9 was the lowest and the TCS 17 had the highest 
cooking loss. In overall, the maize starch appeared have the lowest cooking loss, 
while adding TCS 17 and HAM starch resulted in the highest cooking loss rate. The 
addition of 10% of the starch and rice flour was significantly higher than that of 5% 
results. This was similar with the results of Ryan and Brewer (2005) which was 
adding the sugar content in soy protein increasing its solubility.

ABSTRACT 
 
Soybean is rich in protein (35-40%) and fat (15-20%), of which up to 85% are 
unsaturated. In addition, the Lipoxygenase (Lox-1, Lox-2, 3), contained in soybean 
protein, would catalyze the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids to produce volatile 
components. Thus, it would result into beany off-flavor and affect the acceptance of 
soybean products. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate different heat 
treatments (soaking, steam cooking and blanching) on the residual activity of Lox and the 
flavor formation of soybean. According to the results, the residual activity of three 
isoenzymes of Lox in soybean were significantly (p<0.05) decreased after different heat 
treatments. The lowest residual activities were 13.20, 36.92, and 37.51% for Lox-2, 3 of 
soybean treated by soaking at 85°C for 8 hr, steam cooking 10 min, and blanching 1 min, 
respectively. Considering the time needed for the decrease of Lox-2, 3 residual activity, 
the blanching treatment would be an economic practice, since its treatment time was the 
shortest.

Introduction 
 
Soybean is a highly nutritious food material that contains well balanced amino acids 
and desirable fatty acids and it plays an important role as a protein resource for Asian 
people (Das et al. 2008; Lin 2009). Soybean belongs to the Leguminasae family, which is 
developed to a variety of foods, including natto, tempe, miso, soymilk as well as tofu 
(Huang 2007).  
Lipoxygenase (Lox) is widely distributed in the animal and plant kingdom, e.g., 
algae, baker’s yeast and fungi. It also exists in legumes, such as peas, beans, peanuts and 
potatoes. Three Lox isoenzymes, Lox-1, Lox-2, and Lox-3, are responsible for the 
production of rancid off-flavor in many vegetables, particularly in soybean (Saka et al. 
2000 ; Wang et al. 1994 ; Wang et al. 2008). Lox are non-heme containing enzymes that 
catalyze the stereospecific hydroperoxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, esters and 
glycerides containing a 1-cis, 4-cis-pentadiene structure, such as linoleic acid, linolenic 
acid and arachidonic acid (Beneytout et al. 1986;Hu et al. 2009;Li et al. 2008 
;Schweigger et al. 2005).  
The protein in soybean seeds accounts for about 40% of the dry seed weight, and its 
can be divided into acid precipitation protein or soy protein globulin, and soy whey 
protein, in which the main component of soybean whey protein, including trypsin 
inhibitor, lipoxygenase, β-glucosidase, phosphatase, etc. Although the content is not high, 
it gives a great impact on food processing, such as soybean milk and tofu quality would 
be effect from lipoxygenase and β-glucosidase (Kao 2004;Chen 2000). The oil content of 
soybean contains 20%, and then about 85% are unsaturated fatty acids, and which contain 
essential fatty acids linoleic acid and linolenic acid content as high as 62%, due to

Results and Discussion 
 
1 Lox activity at different soaking conditions 
Changes of soybean Lox activity at different temperatures and soaking times (Figure 
1), exhibited the Lox-1 activity decreased with the increasing of soaking time and 
temperatures. Then soaking at 85°C was found the lowest residual activity (13.20%); and 
Lox-1 will be increased and then decreased, also displayed lowest residual activity 
(13.69%) at 85°C. Li (2007) indicate that Lox-2, 3 enzyme was thermal unstable, 
therefore, this result is agreed with above study. Overall, the Lox activity was found 
decrease with the increasing of soaking time and temperatures, which can effectively 
reduce the Lox activity.

mixing, and forming process. It is a versatile, low cost, and very efficient technology in 
food processing (Ding et al. 2005). Pregelatinized rice flour has more recently been 
prepared mainly by extrusion cooking because of various advantages of this process over 
other traditional methods (Alves et al. 1999). And extrusion can produce high resistance 
starch content. Because resistance starch can not be digested in small intestine, this 
property will lead the low calories and low glycemic index. In addition to amylose 
content, pasting and gelatinization properties are among the most important 
physicochemical properties of starch that determine its applications in food industry and 
other uses (Bao 2008). In the extrusion processing, barrel and screw will provide heat and 
shear force which cause starch gelatinization and damage, and affect pasting and 
gelatinization properties of pregelatinized rice flour. In this research, effects of 
pregelatinized rice flour by different wet extrusion processing conditions (feed rate 300 
g/min; barrel temperature 70, 90 and 110
 o
C; screw speed 33 and 53 rpm) will be 
investigated. 
 
Materials and Methods 
 
Materials 
Taichung Sen 17 (TCS17), Taigung 9 (TG9), and Taichung Waxy 70 (TCW70) 
product from Taiwan was used in this research and stored in the refrigerator of 7
 o
C. 
 
Methods 
1 Amylose content  
Amylose content was measured according to Juliano‘s method (1981).  
2 Degree of gelatinization  
Degree of gelatinization was measured according to Chuang and Yeh (2004) with 
modification. Sample was passed through the screen (100 mesh). 5-10 mg sample mixed 
with deionized water (1:3) in the aluminum dish, covered and sealed and then put in the 
room temperature for 30 min. The analysis of DSC was done with scanning from 30 to 
100
o
C, and heating rate was 10 
o
C/min to determine the enthalpy (∆H) of raw material 
and PGRF.  
Degree of gelatinization value (%) = (1-∆Hpg/ ∆Hraw) × 100% 
∆Hraw= raw material enthalpy, ∆Hpg= PGRF enthalpy. 
3 Damaged starch content  
Damaged starch content of PGRFs were measured by Starch Damage Assay Kit 
(Megazyme International Ireland Ltd Co., Wicklow, Ireland). 
4 Pasting property 
Pasting property was measured by Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA). Sample was passed 
through screen (50-70 mesh). The sample powder (3.00 g, dry basis) were poured into the 
25.00 ml distilled water, heating in 50
o
C for 1 min, was increased to 95
o
C for 2 min 30 
sec, and then was reduced to 50
o
C for 1 min 24 sec. The measured data were Peak 
Viscosity, Final Viscosity and Setback. 
5 Resistant starch content 
Resistant starch content was measured according to Chou and Lin method (2008). The 
sample powder (0.4 g, dry basis) were weighed and put into a pre-weighed centrifuge 
tube, added with 20 ml phosphate buffer (pH 6.0, 55.6 M) and 0.16 g α-amylase (Sigma 
A-3176), and incubated at 37
o
C for 16 hr. The sample was cooled to ambient temperature

Figure 2 showed the damaged starch content (DS) of PGRFs. Table 4 and table 5 showed 
the results of statistical analysis of PGRFs. The different rice varieties resulted in a 
significantly different of DS values at p<0.0001, the barrel temperature had a significantly 
different of DS values at p<0.05, and the screw speed had no significant difference of DS 
values. The interactions had significant differences at different p values. The PGWF has 
the highest damaged starch content (5.20%) compared to PGSF (2.96%) and PGGF 
(2.48%). The barrel temperature (70

4 Pasting property 
4.1 Peak viscosity 
The viscosity of a paste depends on a large extent on the degree of gelatinization of the 
starch granules and the extent of their molecular breakdown (Hagenimana et al. 2006). 
Figure 3 showed the peak viscosity of PGRFs. Table 6 and table 7 showed the results of 
statistical analysis of PGRFs. There have same trend in different rice varieties, barrel 
temperature, and screw speed to affect peak and final viscosity. Peak viscosity has 
significant difference (p<0.0001) in different rice varieties, barrel temperature, screw 
speed and their interactions. The decrease in magnitude of the peak viscosity and final 
viscosity might reflect greater degradation and gelatinization of starch (Hagenimana et al. 
2006). PGWF resulted in the lowest peak viscosity (38.30 RVU) compared to PGGF 
(45.05 RVU) and PGSF (4202 RVU). Because it‘s has the biggest amylopectin content, 
and the amylopectin easier to degradation compared to amylose. Increasing the barrel 
temperature and screw speed will lead decreasing the peak viscosity value. Because it 
increasing the degradation of starch degree. Extrusion process by screw speed 35 rpm, 
and barrel temperature 70

Soybean, a plant of the Leguminasae family, is rich in protein, lipid, lecithin, cellulose, 
saponin, and isoflavones. The highest total isoflavones content could be found in hypocotyl. 
In literature, it has been reported that the more isoflavones, the more antioxidative activity. 
However, the chemical forms and contents of soybean isoflavones would be changed by 
different processing, such as soaking, cooking, roasting, frying and storing. In this study, 
different ratio of soybean hypocotyl powder (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30%) were mixed with 
defatted soybean flour (DSF) and soybean protein isolate (SPI) for manufacturing TSP, to 
investigate the changes of functional, chemical forms and content of isoflavones as well as 
physical properties. From the experiment results, both highest total isoflavones and total 
phenol content could be found in hypocotyl powder within different materials. (28.88 and 
23.75 mg/g). DSF had the best IC50 of DPPH scavenging ability (1536 mg/L). SHP, DSF and 
SPI had the same reducing power at concentration 2500 mg/L, SPI had the best metal ion 
chelating efficiency (573 mg/L). After extrusion (feed rare: 120 g/min; feed moisture 
content: 50%; barrel temperature: 170 and 70℃; motor speed: 300 rpm), the TSP obtained by 
adding 30% SHP had the highest total isoflavones and total phenol content (7.90 and 37.7 
mg/g). The best IC50 of DPPH scavenging ability (905 mg/L) and reducing power at 
concentration 312.5 mg/L (0.143) of TSP were found at adding 0% and 30% SHP, 
respectively, and TSP obtained by adding 0% SHP had the best metal ion chelating 
efficiency (486 mg/L). As to physical properties of TSP, the moisture content, color (L and b 
value) and cooking loss would be increased with the increasing of SHP ratio, but cutting 
force decreased, the highest water absorption index was found at adding 20% SHP.

Introduction 
 
Soybean and its products are importantly traditional foods in Asia countries. Pyo and 
others (2005) reported that the consumption of soybean foods would decreased the risks of 
chronic diseases. The consumption of soybean isoflavones per day are 20-100 mg in Asia 
countries, which is higher than America and Western Europe (Jackson et al. 2002). The 
functional properties of soybean products would be attended due to rich in phytoestrogen, 
especially in soybean isoflavones.  
Soybean is made up by coat (8%), cotyledon (90%) and hypocotyl (2%), containing 
about 0.2-0.4% isoflavones (Wang and Murphy 1994), and the highest isoflavones content 
                                                                                                            Food Innovation Asia Conference 2010: 
                                                                       Indigenous Food Research and Development to Global Market,  
                                                                                             June 17-18 2010, BITEC, Bangkok, THAILAND

Results and Discussion 
 
1 Chemical properties analysis 
1.1 Total isoflavones content  
The isoflavones content of materials were shown in Table 1, it was observed that total 
isoflavones content of SHP, DSF and SPI were 28.88, 2.55 and 5.87 mg/g. The lowest total 
isoflavones and aglycones content could be observed in DSF. Thus, the SPI exhibited a lower 
total isoflavones content than SHP, it may be explained by the SPI manufacturing made from 
soybean flour, 74% of total isoflavone was loss during processing (Wang et al. 1998). 
The isoflavones content (aglycones, β-glucosides, acetylglucosides and  malonylglucosides) 
of TSP with adding different ratio of SHP (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30%) were shown in 
Table 2, it was observed that the highest isoflavone type was aglycones in 7 group of TSP, 
followed by β-glucosides, acetylglucosides and  malonylglucosides. It could be attributed to 
the conversion from malonylglucosides to acetylglucosides, and both also conversed to 
                                                                                                            Food Innovation Asia Conference 2010:

                                                                                             June 17-18 2010, BITEC, Bangkok, THAILAND

1.3 Free radical (DPPH) scavenging capacity 
The DPPH free radical scavenging capacity was evaluated by inhibition concentration 
50 (IC50), which were shown in figure 3. No positive correlation could be found between 
DPPH free radical scavenging and aglycones content, which is not agreed with Lee and 
others (2004), it could be attributed to the materials from soybean. It also contained phenol 
compounds or other components, including saponins, carotenoids, riboflavin, ascorbic acid 
and tocophenols, which play important roles in DPPH free radical scavenging (Vedavanam et 
al. 1999; Kao 2007). Thus, no correlation between DPPH free radical scavenging and 
isoflavone content would be observed (Kao 2007).  
The results of DPPH free radical scavenging capacity of TSP was shown in figure 4. 
The TSP with 0% SHP exhibited the highest scavenging capacity; it may be attributed to the 
better radical scavenging capacity of DSF. Lee and others (2005) reported that no significant 
difference between glucosides and aglycones isoflavones, but the efficiency of glucosides for 
inhibiting LDL oxidation  were higher than aglycones, further influencing the antioxidative 
activity.

Table 4 showed the reducing power of TSP with different sample concentration, which 
would be not increased with SHP increasing (p<0.05). It would be found that the reducing 
power increased with sample concentration increased, but insignificant increasing with the 
increasing of adding different ratio of SHP, due to no positive correlation between isoflavone 
content and antioxidative activity of soybean products (Kao 2007). The TSP with 30% SHP 
adding ratio exhibited the highest reducing power, which contained 3.17 mg/g aglycones and 
37.7 mg/g total phenol content. Kao (2007) reported that aglycones extract solution had the 
highest reducing power, followed by acetylglycosides, but lower in malonylglusosides and β-
glucosides. In addition, the extract solution with higher total isoflavone and total phenol 
content showed higher reducing power, the results of this research are corresponded with 
above study.

1.5 Metal ion chelating efficiency  
The metal ion chelating efficiency was evaluated by inhibition concentration 50 (IC50), 
which were shown in figure 5. It was observed that SPI (1868 mg/L) exhibited the highest 
content, followed by DSF (675 mg/L) and SHP (573 mg/L), which is corresponding with the 
results of total isoflavone content. It may be attributed to the lower metal ion chelating 
efficiency of aglycones and acetylglycisides.

 278 
significant increased with SHP adding ratio increased (p<0.05). It may be attributed to the 
decreasing of shear force due to the oil of SHP during extrusion processing, resulting in the 
shorting of retention time in extruder, further influencing physical properties of TSP, and 
increasing the moisture content with the lower water loss (Chen 2006; Huang 2007).  In 
addition, the component of SPI is similar to the physical properties of 11s globulin, the 
protein molecules would be tightly ordered after extrusion processing, further influencing the 
water holding capacity (Feng 2009).

2.2 Color  
The results of color analysis of TSP with adding different ratio of SHP (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 
25 and 30%) were shown in table 6, it was found that the L value and b value of TSP would 
be significant increased with SHP adding ratio increased (p<0.05). The highest L value 
(65.93) and b value (13.61) were found at 30% SHP adding ratio, but a value showed 
increasing, then decreasing, and the highest a value exhibited at 20% SHP adding ratio. The 
results are agreed with the previous study (Huang 2007), the b value would be increased with 
the soybean hypocotyl powder increasing.

2.4 Cooking loss 
The results of cooking loss of TSP with adding different ratio of SHP (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 
25 and 30%) were shown in table 8. Results showed that cooking loss of TSP would be 
significant increased with SHP adding ratio increased (p<0.05). It could be attributed to the 
higher emulsifier between water and oil, which disperse in water and influence the cooking 
loss.

2.5 Water absorption index 
The results of water absorption index of TSP with adding different ratio of SHP (0, 5, 
10, 15, 20, 25 and 30%) were displayed in table 9. According to the previous studies (Chen 
2006; Huang 2007; Feng 2009), the water absorption index would be significant increased 
with SPI adding ratio increased (p<0.05), but this research were not. The highest (4.13 g/g) 
and lowest (3.72 g/g) water absorption index were exhibit at 30 and 20% SHP adding ratio, 
respectively. But no significant difference (p>0.05) would be found at 0 and 10%, similar 
results also observed at 15 and 25%.

添加不同米穀粉、澱粉與全脂黃豆粉對組織化大豆蛋白理化與機能性質的影響
之研究
A study of effects of adding different rice flours, starches, and
full fat soybean flour on the physicochemical and functional
properties of textured soybean protein

擠壓技術之所以可在全球食品科技中佔有如此重要之地位，其原因主要在於其
連續式的生產過程可取代傳統批式生產的繁複過程，同時更有多樣化、高產能
、低成本及無廢棄物等多項優點。組織化大豆蛋白（Textured Soybean
Protein, TSP），亦稱為人造肉或素肉，主要多以大豆蛋白為加工原料，利用
食品擠壓技術生產而製成的肉類仿製品（Meat analog），在國內、外已行之多
年，但如何在既有之設備開創高附加價值之素食產品，是本研究所開發技術的
關鍵。整體來說，添加澱粉製作之組織化大豆蛋白有較佳的膨潤與外觀，特別
是添加馬鈴薯澱粉所製作之組織化大豆蛋白；其在抗氧化能力與抗性澱粉含量
上比較高。相較於去年研究計畫的成果，本計畫完成較低成本方式建立不僅有
「機能性」且更具「外觀與口感」的素肉的製作程序。可提昇國內素肉產業的
加工技術以增加市場上的競爭力。
Totally speaking, addition of starch in TSP will have a swelling
outlook, especially for TSP made of potato starch addition. As to the
antioxidant ability and RS content, it also had higher values.
Comparing to what has achieved in the past, a process of TSP with
lower cost of production and better outlook-mouthfeel had been set
up. Looking in the future, the indigenious vergetable industry can
have more competitives in the market, if they apply this processing
technolgoy into their products.

透過個人在擠壓組織化大豆蛋白方面的研究，已經引起國內素肉產業的注意，
過去曾有業者希望入門學習，卻不願付技術轉移費用。今天在組織化大豆蛋白
量產技術已經成熟，隨時可以技術轉移給廠商。但大部分食品產業為中小企業，
資本有限，個人在今年亦透過經濟部學者關懷計畫輔導大豆加工業者，不斷地
與相關產業接觸，個人有信心，總有一天，多年國科會研發的成果，可以技轉
出去。
