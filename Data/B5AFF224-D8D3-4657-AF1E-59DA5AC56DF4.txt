Abstract—A new class of wideband multi-section 
1800 hybrid couplers using the vertically installed 
planar (VIP) coupler is proposed. On the basis of 
the reconfigured ideal single-section 1800 hybrid 
coupler (the 1800 hybrid coupler with an ideal phase 
inverter), the multi-section 1800 hybrid couplers can 
be realized by properly cascading of single-section 
1800 hybrid couplers. Compared to the conventional 
hybrid ring, the two-section hybrid couplers exhibit 
wide bandwidth, size reduction, and easily 
achievable high power-division ratios. Design 
equations based on the equal-ripple functions are 
derived. Design curves for the equal and unequal 
power-division ratio are also described. Besides, a 
cascade of single-section cascadable hybrid 
couplers with a unit element at each I/O port can be 
used for bandwidth enhancement. Good agreements 
are obtained between the experimental and 
simulated results.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The 1800 hybrid ring coupler is an important and 
fundamental component in microwave circuit 
applications such as balanced mixers, push-pull 
amplifiers, phase shifters, and feeding networks of 
antenna arrays. In the conventional hybrid ring, the 
1800 phase shifter is implemented by a λ/2 
transmission line and its phase-shift is only 1800 at 
the center frequency. Therefore, the conventional 
hybrid ring using 3λ/4 line section results in large 
size and narrow bandwidth. Besides, it requires a 
quite high impedance line for large power-division 
ratios. There are many approaches to overcome 
these limitations [1]-[5]. March [1] replaced the 
3λ/4 transmission line with an opposing ends 
short-circuited λ/4 coupled line (we simply call it 
“short-ended coupled line”) to increase the 
bandwidth of the hybrid ring. A theory of cascading 
of several quarter-wave transmission-line sections 
to each I/O port of an ideal 1800 hybrid ring for 
bandwidth improvement has been proposed by 
Rehnmark [2]. Chang et al. [3] have proposed a 
method to implement the hybrid ring proposed in 
[2]. However, to implement these hybrid rings 
requires extremely low and/or high impedance lines 
or extremely tight coupled lines especially for large 
power-division ratio situations. To reduce the 
impedance values, the 3λ/4 line section of the 
hybrid ring can be split into three λ/4 lines [4]. 
However, the required high impedance values still 
increase with power-division ratios. Therefore, the 
realizable highest and/or lowest impedance values 
limit the achievable power-division ratios of those

When Y1=Y3 and Y2=Y4, all ports can be perfectly 
matched and the signal incident at the input port 
will be split between port 3 and port 4. Although all 
ports can be perfectly matched for the case of Y1=Y4 
and Y2=Y3, a zero dB coupler, which means that no 
signal can be obtained from one of the output ports, 
is obtained. Therefore, we concentrate our attention 
in the case of Y1=Y3 and Y2=Y4. Because in this case 
the two-section hybrid ring consists of two identical 
single-section hybrid rings, the synthesis procedure 
can be largely simplified. Again, applying the 
multi-port connection method to (3), we obtain

According to (7), (12), (13), and (14), the unknown

should be emphasized that there exists two set of 
solutions. Let us discuss in the following. 
Fig. 3 shows the plot of characteristic impedances 
of Z1, Z2, and bandwidth versus return loss for the 
3-dB two-section hybrid ring shown in Fig. 1(c).

 mainly odd-mode and the field of odd-mode is 
mostly confined in the VIP substrate, the crossover 
has negligible influence on circuit performance. 
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
As we mentioned previously, the VIP coupler is a 
good candidate to realize the phase inverter and the 
crossover on microstrip circuits. Four prototype 
circuits are fabricated that all of them are with a 
15-dB of equal-ripple return loss. Four prototype 
circuits are a single-section reconfigured 3-dB 
hybrid ring to observe the performance of the 
single-section building block, a two-section 3-dB 
hybrid ring with the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 
1(c) to verify the validity of the theory derived in 
previous section, a two-section 20-dB hybrid ring to 
show the high power-division ratio of the proposed 
design in Fig. 1(c), and a two-section 3-dB hybrid 
ring with the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 2 to 
depict the bandwidth extension performance. 
The 3-D view of the reconfigured single-section 
hybrid ring is shown in Fig. 10 and the photograph 
of the reconfigured and conventional 3-dB hybrid 
rings is depicted in Fig. 11. The required VIP 
coupler parameters with Z=59Ω are also shown in 
Table I. It can be seen that the reconfigured 
single-section hybrid ring is compact compared to 
the conventional one. The measured performance, 
although not shown, is very close to theoretical 
results. This is the basic building block of next three 
two-section hybrids. 
The two-section 3-dB hybrid ring with the 
equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 1(c) and a 
photograph shown in Fig. 12(a) has the line 
impedances of Z1=99.60Ω and Z2=41.26Ω . The 
designed passband is 1.04-2.96GHz (96% 
bandwidth). Fig. 13 shows the simulated and 
measured results and the measured insertion loss is 
approximately 0.4dB. The measured return losses 
are better than 10 dB from 1.06 to 3GHz for 
out-of-phase operation and from 1.16 to 3.04GHz 
for in-phase operation, respectively. The measured 
isolation is typically better than 20 dB from 0.5 to 
3.5 GHz. The measured amplitude and phase 
imbalances are shown in Fig. 14. For out-of-phase 
operation, the amplitude imbalance is within 1 dB 
from 1.06 to 3.1GHz and the phase imbalance is 
within 100 from 1.08 to 3.5GHz. For in-phase 
operation, the amplitude imbalance is within 1 dB 
from 0.96 to 3.5GHz and the phase imbalance is 
within 100 from 0.5 to 3.5GHz. The required VIP 
coupler parameters with Z=41.3Ω are shown in 
Table I. 
The two-section 20-dB hybrid ring with the 
equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 1(c) and a 
photograph shown in Fig. 12(b)  has line 
impedances of Z1=56.21Ω and Z2=50.84Ω. The 
measured and simulated results are shown in Fig. 15. 
The designed passband is 1.144-2.856GHz (85.5% 
bandwidth). The measured equal-ripple return loss 
bandwidth is a little narrower than the simulated 
result. The measured isolation is better than 25 dB 
from 0.5 to 3.5 GHz. The measured phase 
performances are not shown here because they are 
not important for loose coupling. The required VIP 
coupler parameters with Z=50.8Ω are shown in 
Table I. In contrast, a single section 20-dB hybrid 
ring with unit element should have Z1=364.1Ω, 
Z2=36.41Ω, and ZT (impedance of a unit element) 
=38.9Ω which can hardly be realized by microstrip 
or CPW circuit. The single section 20-dB hybrid 
ring without unit element has higher impedance 
values that are more difficult to implement. 
The two-section 3-dB hybrid ring with the 
equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 2 and a photograph 
shown in Fig. 12(c) has the line impedances of 
Z1=71.48Ω, Z2=29.61Ω, Z3=34.29Ω, and 
Z4=29.12Ω. The designed passband is 
0.66-3.34GHz (134% bandwidth). Fig. 16 shows the 
simulated and measured results and the measured 
insertion loss is approximately 0.6dB. The 
measured return losses are better than 10 dB from 
0.72 to 3.38GHz for out-of-phase operation and 
from 0.82 to 3.36GHz for in-phase operation, 
respectively. The measured isolation is better than 
20 dB from 1.16 to 3.5 GHz. The measured 
amplitude and phase imbalances are shown in Fig. 
17. For out-of-phase operation, the amplitude 
imbalance is within 1 dB from 0.72 to 3.5GHz and 
the phase imbalance is within 100 from 0.9 to 
3.3GHz. For in-phase operation, the amplitude 
imbalance is within 1 dB from 0.72 to 3.36GHz and 
the phase imbalance is within 100 from 0.76 to 
3.38GHz. The required VIP coupler parameters

 structure [6] to design a wideband bandpass filter so 
that the above-described shortcomings can be 
solved. This filter with the stepped-impedance 
structure acquires not only size reduction, but also 
better upper stopband clearance. The experimental 
results show good agreements with the simulated 
results. 
 
II. ANALYSIS AND DESIGN OF THE PROPOSED 
BANDPASS FILTER   
The basic structure of the proposed bandpass 
filter is shown in Fig.1 (a) where the electrical 
length (θ) of each transmission line is 900 and the 
admittances Y1 and Y2 are normalized values with 
respect to system admittance Y0. Note that the filter 
configuration shown in Fig. 1(a) is different from 
the filter in [2] where, in [2], the second rat-race 
ring is flipped with respect to horizontal central line 
of Fig. 1(a). From [5], at the center frequency, the 
S-parameters of the circuit shown in Fig.1 (a) can 
be expressed as 
                           (1) 02211 == SS

When Y1=Y2, the signal excited at port 1 is 
equally divided between 3’ and 4’ and no power 
reaches 2’. The signal arriving at 3’ and 4’ are out 
of phase. Then, the signal at 3’ is equally divided 
between 3” and 4” and the signal arriving at 3” and 
4” are out of phase. The signal at 4’ is equally 
divided between 3” and 4” and the signal arriving at 
3” and 4” are in phase. Therefore, all of the power 
excited at port 1 will be delivered to port 4 and no 
power reaches port 3 and port 2 (corresponding to a 
0-dB coupler). This means that a bandpass response 
can be obtained by cascading two 3-dB 180o hybrid 
rings. With the design method described in [5], the 
bandwidth of this filter corresponding to specific 
return losses can be obtained. Here, to increase the 
order and the bandwidth of the proposed filter, a 900 
transmission line of impedance Z3 can be added 
between two 180o hybrids [7], [8] as shown in Fig.1 
(b).  
The simulated results of the filters in Fig. 1 with 
15-dB return loss are depicted in Fig. 2 that they 
correspond to third (Z1=Z2=53.31Ω) and fourth 
(Z1=Z2=58.65Ω and Z3=41.16Ω) order filter 
respectively. Although wide passband can be easily 
achieved, the first spurious passband at 3f0 results in 
poor upper stopband performance. In [9], the 
frequency of the first spurious response of the 180o 
hybrid ring can be moved using the 
stepped-impedance structure by adjusting its 
structural parameters. Thus, by applying the 
stepped- impedance structure to Fig.1 (b), a 
wideband filter with broad upper stopband 
characteristics can be obtained. 
A quarter-wave transmission line of impedance Z 
is shown in Fig. 3(a) and it serves as a basic 
building block of the proposed bandpass filter. Its 
ABCD matrix is given by

characteristic impedances of the cascaded sections 
and θH and θL are the corresponding electrical 
lengths. By choosing ZH>ZL, the overall electrical 
length of the stepped-impedance section can be 
shortened and the first spurious response frequency 
can be push to higher frequency. The ABCD matrix 
of the stepped-impedance section shown in Fig. 3(b)

By equating the matrix elements in (2) and (4), the 
 14
 stepped-impedance wideband bandpass filter has 
been designed and fabricated to exhibit wide 
passband and broad stopband performance 
simultaneously. The short-ended step impedance 
VIP coupler has provided a good phase inverter as 
well as a crossover in this realized filter. In addition, 
the bandwidth can be further enhanced by cascading 
more sections of 900 transmission lines in this 
proposed structure. The experimental results are in 
good agreement with the simulated results.

 microstrip line with defected ground was employed 
to give a tight coupling for a wideband bandpass 
filter. However, in [5] and [6], the more the 
fractional bandwidth is required, the smaller the gap 
size is demanded to enhance the coupling. In [7], a 
wideband bandpass filter using two cascadable 180o 
hybrid rings is proposed. It can obtain wider 
bandwidth by cascading more hybrid rings, but it 
still increases the circuit area. Another class of 
wideband BPFs was constructed using the 
multiple-mode-resonator (MMR) as initially 
proposed in [8]. Later on, various MMR-based 
UWB BPFs have been implemented in microstrip, 
coplanar-waveguide, slotline, as well as many other 
hybrid structures [9], [10]. 
In this year’s project, a novel wideband 
bandpass filter is proposed and analyzed. The 
synthesis mathematics shows that the filter should 
be a Chebyshev response of order five. Design 
equations and design curves of this filter are 
provided. Using these equations and curves, a 
wideband bandpass filter can be readily realized. A 
filter with 100% fractional bandwidth and 20-dB 
passband return loss is designed as an example. 
This filter is implemented on a 15-mil Al2O3 
substrate. The experimental results show excellent 
agreements with the calculated results. 
II. ANALYSIS AND DESIGN OF THE PROPOSED 
BANDPASS FILTER   
The basic structure of the proposed wideband 
bandpass filter is shown in Fig.1, where the 
electrical length of each transmission line is 900. Z1, 
Z2 and Z3 are the impedances of hybrid ring, 
short-circuited stub, and open-circuited stub 
respectively. In order to analyze the characteristics 
of the proposed wideband bandpass filter, the even 
and odd-mode analysis are applied. The even and 
odd-mode half circuits are shown in Fig. 2. The 
reflection coefficient for the even- and odd-mode 
are given by

where RL is the return loss level in dB at 1±=ω . 
As described by Cameron [11], it is assumed that 
the polynomials ( )ωP , ( )ωF  and ( )ωE  are 
normalized such that their highest-degree 
coefficients are unity. The polynomials ( )ωP  
carries the information of transmission zeros. For a 
Chebyshev filter function ε  is a constant 
normalizing ( )ω21S to the equiripple level at 1±=ω . 
According to the conservation of energy 
( 1221

11 =+ SS ) and equation (8), we can obtain 
 20
 presented. With these design equations and design 
curves, the wideband bandpass filter can be easily 
designed and implemented. In addition, the 
bandwidth can be further enhanced by cascading 
more sections of 900 transmission lines with 
open-circuited and short-circuited stubs. Finally, the 
experimental results have shown in good agreement 
with the simulated results.
