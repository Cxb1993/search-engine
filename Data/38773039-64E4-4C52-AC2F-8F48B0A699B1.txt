For the two-symbol diﬀerential detector, 16APSK has
larger minimum noncoherent distance and thus better
bit error rate (BER) than 16QAM; while for multiple-
symbol diﬀerential detection with larger observation
length such as ﬁve, 16QAM has better BER than
16APSK [3].
In this report, we ﬁrst propose a new algorithm and
some new encoding tables and constellations. When
M is large, the bit-assigning method in [3] is compli-
cated and may not result in the best assignment. The
new bit-assigning algorithm we proposed is performed
by computers, so it is more suitable than the method
in [3] for large N . We also construct constellations
and tables that maximize minimum noncoherent dis-
tance for two-symbol detection. Unlike the 16APSK
in [3] which has a ﬁxed ring ratio, we try the ring
ratio of 16APSK and ﬁnd the best one that maxi-
mizes minimum noncoherent distance. Besides, we
ﬁnd the best ring ratio of 16TASPK (twisted APSK)
which has slightly better minimum noncoherent dis-
tance than 16APSK and also modify the constella-
tions of 16QAM and 16APSK to enlarge minimum
noncoherent distance.
The error performance of the proposed diﬀeren-
tial encoding for multiple-symbol diﬀerential detec-
tion was also shown in [3]. But the diﬀerential en-
coding in [3] is considered for two-symbol diﬀerential
detection. In this report, we propose a new deﬁnition
of diﬀerential encoding for multiple-symbol diﬀeren-
tial detection, called multiple-symbol diﬀerential en-
coding. Both distance analysis and simulation results
conﬁrm that the new diﬀerential encoding is better
than the original diﬀerential encoding.
Diﬀerential encoding by a table, which is a possibly
nonlinear function depending on the previous trans-
mitted symbol, is a ﬁnite-state machine. Therefore,
diﬀerential encoding by a table can be described by
a trellis diagram. With this trellis diagram, one can
use the Viterbi algorithm at the diﬀerential detec-
tor to improve the error performance. For N -symbol
diﬀerential detection, the original trellis for an M-ary
constellation contains MN−1 states, but we show that
an equivalent trellis with fewer states is possible and
the number of trellis states is determined by the sig-
nal constellation and the encoding table. Simulation
results show that the proposed detection can improve
bit error rate (BER) if the number of states of the
equivalent trellis is larger than one.
To further improve the error performance of diﬀer-
ential encoding, channel coding such as trellis coding
is necessary. Recently, we proposed a novel nonco-
herent trellis coded modulation (TCM) scheme in [5]
and [6], in which a diﬀerential encoder is concatenated
with a convolutional encoder. In this report, we con-
struct appropriate tables for diﬀerential encoding in
the noncoherent TCM scheme in [6] as well. Simula-
tion results conﬁrm that adding a convolutional en-
coder outperforms the original diﬀerential encoding,
and using the diﬀerential encoding by a table has bet-
ter BER than using the original diﬀerential encoding.
Moreover, for the diﬀerential encoder by a table, we
propose an augmented-state trellis to further enhance
the error performance.
Diﬀerential space-time modulation (DSTM) [7],[8]
attracts much attention in recent years. For the deﬁ-
nition of DSTM, data bits determine a data block and
the transmitted block is the data block multiplied by
the previously transmitted block. Therefore, the set
of transmitted blocks may be larger than the set of
data blocks, and the constellation of the signals in the
data blocks may be expanded to be the constellation
of the transmitted signals. For two transmitter anten-
nas, the DSTM proposed in [9] and [10], which has
the best error performance among all DSTM codes
with data rate 2 bits/sec/Hz, has such constellation
expansion.
In this report, similar to the idea in [3], we propose
a general deﬁnition of DSTM by which the original
deﬁnition of DSTM in [7] and [8] is its special case.
Based on the general deﬁnition, we propose a new
deﬁnition of DSTM by which the set of transmitted
blocks is decided ﬁrst so that constellation expansion
is avoided. From the viewpoint of the same ﬁxed con-
stellation, this deﬁnition of DSTM is more similar to
diﬀerential encoding for one antenna than the original
deﬁnition. In this deﬁnition, the transmitted block is
determined by the previously transmitted block and
current data bits, which can be implemented by a
look-up table. Similarly, the encoding table can be
optimized by the algorithms in [3]. The diﬀerential
detector can use a trellis also and we propose a the-
orem to reduce the number of states of the decoding
trellis as well. For considered examples, distance anal-
ysis and simulation results show that the proposed
DSTM has similar error performance without constel-
lation expansion.
Our main results and contributions are summarized
as follows.
1) A computer-based bit-assigning algorithm is pro-
posed. Using this algorithm, the encoding table
for diﬀerential modulation with large M can be

where c = (xt−1, xt), r = (rt−1, rt) and <
,> denotes the complex inner product. Let
dnc((xt−1, xt), (x′t−1, x
′
t)) denote the noncoherent dis-
tance between c = (xt−1, xt) and c′ = (x′t−1, x
′
t),
which is deﬁned by d2nc(c, c
′) = 1
2
(‖c‖2 + ‖c′‖2)− | <
c, c′ > | [16]. If two codewords c and c′ satisfy
c = c′ejθ for some θ, they are noncoherently indis-
tinguishable, i.e., dnc(c, c
′) = 0. In [3], the minimum
noncoherent distance of a diﬀerential encoder was de-
ﬁned by
dmin = min
xt−1,x′t−1∈S
bt =b′t
dnc((xt−1, xt), (x′t−1, x
′
t)) (3)
where xt = E(xt−1,bt) and x′t = E(x
′
t−1,b
′
t).
Let all (xt−1, xt) codewords which correspond to
the same bt form a group. Consequently, there are
totally M groups, denoted by G0, G1, · · · , GM−1,
and each group contains M codewords (xt−1 = s0, xt),
(xt−1 = s1, xt), · · · , (xt−1 = sM−1, xt). To maximize
dmin, if two codewords c and c
′ have small dnc(c, c′),
one should put them into the same group if possi-
ble; Otherwise, they should be put into two diﬀerent
groups which diﬀer smallest number of bits in bt. The
method to optimize diﬀerential encoding is listed as
follows.
Step 1 Sort all
(
M2
2
)
possible codeword pairs c =
(xt−1, xt) and c′ = (x′t−1, x
′
t) according to
dnc(c, c
′), from small values to large values.
Step 2 Arrange G0, G1, · · · , GM−1, and L: Take
codeword pairs one by one from the sorted code-
word pairs in order. Put two codewords of a
pair into the same group if possible; Otherwise,
put them into two diﬀerent groups and the two
groups are written into the list of near group
pairs denoted by L.
Step 3 Assign bt to G0, G1, · · · , GM−1 according to
L: Take group pairs one by one in order from L.
The number of diﬀerent bits in bt for the consid-
ered two groups should be as small as possible.
Two algorithms were proposed for Step 2. The
ﬁrst one is not always successful. If it succeeds, it
was shown in [3] that the obtained table maximizes
the minimum noncoherent distance; but if it fails, we
should use the second algorithm which is always suc-
cessful but cannot guarantee the optimization. In [3],
the task of assigning data bits in Step 3 is done by
hands. When M is large, the task is complicated
and may not obtain the best assignment. After three
steps, we obtain the optimized tables for diﬀerential
16QAM and 16APSK in [3].
B．Extended Results on Constructing
Encoding Tables
In this section, we ﬁrst modify Step 3. An al-
gorithm of assigning bt to M groups, without
taking group pairs one by one in order from L, is
proposed. This algorithm uses the binary switching
algorithm, [17], [18], with a diﬀerent cost func-
tion. The binary switching algorithm randomly
assigns patterns of bt to groups G0, G1, · · · , GM−1,
and then tries all possible switches one by one,
(G0, G1), (G0, G2), · · · , (G0, GM−1), (G1, G2), (G1, G3), · · · ,
(GM−2, GM−1). For each switch, determine whether
the assignment with the switch is better than the
assignment without the switch. If it is better, make
this switch and try all possible switches from the
beginning (G0, G1); Otherwise, undo this switch
and try next switch. The cost function to evaluate
assignments of bt is proposed as follows. We say that
an assignment is better than another assignment if
its total diﬀerent bits of the codeword pairs with
the smallest distance is fewer, or ∃ some k its total
diﬀerent bits of the codeword pairs with the i-th
smallest distance is the same ∀1 ≤ i ≤ k but its
total diﬀerent bits of the codeword pairs with the
k + 1-th smallest distance is fewer. One should start
the algorithm with diﬀerent assignment several times
and select the best ﬁnal assignment. Using this
algorithm for Step 3, the method of constructing
4
the number of reference symbols Nr aﬀects mini-
mum noncoherent distance dmin and decoding com-
plexity. An encoding table has MN−Nr rows for dif-
ferent data bits and each row corresponding to the
same data bits contains MNr codewords. When Nr
increases, the number of codewords corresponding to
the same data bits also increases, so dmin may in-
crease as well. On the other hand at the receiver,
the N -symbol ML diﬀerential detection determines
bt+N−Nr−1t based on xt−Nr , · · · , xt+N−Nr−1, and deter-
mines bt+2N−2Nr−1t+N−Nr based on xt+N−Nr , · · · , xt+2N−Nr−1
next, and so on. In other words, N−Nr data symbols
are detected for each ML detection whose complexity
is proportional to MN and independent to the value
of Nr. Therefore, for the same amount of data bits,
more times of the ML diﬀerential detection are re-
quired if Nr increases.
Let’s take 16QAM with N = 3 as an
example. Note that for any two code-
words c = (xt−Nr , · · · , xt+N−Nr−1) and
c′ = (x′t−Nr , · · · , x′t+N−Nr−1), rotating xi and x′i
by the same phase does not aﬀect dnc(c, c
′). For the
at of 16QAM in Fig. 1(b), rotating the symbol of at
by π
2
always becomes the symbol of at + 4 mod 16.
In [3], the codeword pair {(3, 1), (3, 6)} (and its
rotated versions {(3, 5), (3, 10)}, {(3, 9), (3, 14)} and
{(3, 13), (3, 2)}) cannot be put into the same group
due to at−1 = a′t−1 = 3, which results in d
2
min = 0.0338
for N = 2. Consequently, for the three-symbol ML
diﬀerential detection, the diﬀerential encoding of [3]
has the codeword pair {(3, 1, 1), (3, 6, 6)} (and its
rotated versions) which results in d2min = 0.0366 for
N = 3. However, for the three-symbol diﬀerential
encoding with Nr = 2, {(3, 1, 1), (3, 6, 6)} (and its
rotated versions) can be put into the same group,
due to (at−2, at−1) = (3, 1) = (a′t−2, a′t−1) = (3, 6),
and thus correspond to the same data bits. We
construct a table to maximize d2min with N = 3
and Nr = 2, and ﬁnd that the table cannot be
obtained by the ﬁrst algorithm in Step 2. This
table constructed by the second algorithm cannot
be presented in this report due to the space limit
and can be found in [19]. Using the new table, the
two codewords in each codeword pair with squared
noncoherent distance 0.0366 correspond to the same
data bits, and the value of d2min becomes 0.0583.
But for the three-symbol diﬀerential encoding with
Nr = 1, {(3, 1, 1), (3, 6, 6)} and its rotated versions
still cannot be put into the same group, due to
at−1 = a′t−1 = 3. On the other hand, for the receiver
with N = 3, Nr = 2 is twice as complex as Nr = 1

(a) a block diagram (b) a trellis diagram.
because Nr = 1 detects eight data bits each time but
Nr = 2 detects only four data bits each time.
For the original diﬀerential encoding of 16APSK
and 16TAPSK, the values of d2min with N = 3 are
0.0889 and 0.1090, respectively. For the three-symbol
diﬀerential encoding of 16APSK and 16TAPSK with
Nr = 2, we also construct tables to maximize d
2
min
and ﬁnd that the tables can be obtained by the ﬁrst
algorithm in Step 2. For 16APSK, we ﬁnd that
the obtained table is equivalent to the original ta-
ble for two-symbol diﬀerential encoding, but the op-
timal value of rH/rL is approximately 1.64, satisfy-
ing dnc((0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 2)) = dnc((0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1)), by
which d2min becomes 0.1095. For 16TAPSK, the ob-
tained tables of three-symbol diﬀerential encoding
which can be found in [19] cannot be presented in
this paper due to the space limit also, and the opti-
mal value of rH/rL is approximately 1.52, satisfying
dnc((0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 2)) = dnc((0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1)), which
results in d2min = 0.1217.
D．Diﬀerential Detection by a Trellis
According to the deﬁnition, diﬀerential encoding can
be illustrated by the block diagram shown in Fig. 2(a).
Because in the diﬀerential encoder there is a mem-
ory which contains M possible values, the diﬀeren-
tial encoding can be represented by an M-state trellis
diagram shown in Fig. 2(b) in which the i-th state
denotes si. A distinct diﬀerential encoder E (i.e., a
distinct look-up table) means a distinct labeling of bt
to trellis branches.
Diﬀerential encoding by a table is equivalent to dif-
ferential encoding by a trellis. However, with the

E．Diﬀerential Encoding Concatenated
with Trellis Coding
The noncoherently non-catastrophic TCM scheme
proposed in [5] and [6] can provide better BER than
diﬀerential encoding. The transmitter of the general
scheme in [6] consists of a diﬀerential encoder, a ro-
tator, an inverse signal mapper, a systematic convo-
lutional encoder and a signal mapper. The signal set
consisting of 2m+1 signal points is denoted by A0, and
its two subsets obtained after the ﬁrst set partitioning
are denoted by B0 and B1 [20]-[22]. The task of the
diﬀerential encoder is diﬀerentially encoding data bits
bt0, · · · , btm−1 to generate an output symbol in B0. Fig-
ure 4 shows the block diagrams for the case of 4-state
TCM where m = 4.
The noncoherently non-catastrophic TCM can be
viewed as diﬀerential encoding concatenated with
trellis coding, and the concatenation aims to pro-
vide better BER than original diﬀerential encoding.
For example, consider 32APSK which consists of two
rings of 16PSK and let B0 of 32APSK be 16APSK.
In the noncoherently non-catastrophic trellis-coded
32APSK scheme, four data bits are sent into a diﬀer-
ential encoder of 16APSK, and then one redundant
bit is added by trellis coding to select one 32APSK

signal.
The diﬀerential encoding used in [6] is performed
by a rule, so in this section we try to use the diﬀer-
ential encoding by a table. A simple and straight-
forward receiver is to use the Viterbi decoding for
TCM to generate hard-decision outputs, and then dif-
ferentially detects the outputs without a trellis. To
improve the error performance, a possible way is to
use the soft-output Viterbi algorithm for TCM and
then use Viterbi algorithm with a trellis in diﬀeren-
tial detection. However, this separate decoding is not
optimal and has long delay due to two Viterbi de-
coding with truncation length, so we propose to com-
bine the decoder for TCM with the diﬀerential detec-
tor. All blocks in Fig. 4 can be viewed as a super-
block, surrounded by dashed lines in Fig. 4, with in-
put bt0, b
t
1, · · · , btm−1 and output xt, so the Viterbi de-
coding for this super-block is optimal.
F．Performance Comparison
In this section, we consider simulation results of var-
ious schemes in previous sections. Diﬀerent schemes
are compared for N -symbol diﬀerential detection with
the same N .
We ﬁrst consider various modulation in Sec. III.
Simulation results of two-symbol diﬀerential detection
are shown in Fig. 5. For 16APSK at high SNRs, the
gain of rH/rL = 1.55 over rH/rL = 2 exceeds 1dB.
At high SNRs, the modiﬁed 16QAM (denoted by m-
16QAM) outperforms 16QAM signiﬁcantly but still
has worse BER than other modulations, and the gen-
eralized 16APSK (denoted by g-16APSK) is the best
but is also close to 16APSK and 16TAPSK with the
optimal rH/rL.
We then focus on multiple-symbol diﬀerential en-
coding. Simulation results of three-symbol diﬀerential
detection are presented in Fig. 6, in which the dashed

G．Diﬀerential Space-Time Modula-
tion
Consider a communication system with nT transmit
antennas and nR receive antennas. The channels be-
tween antenna pairs are Rayleigh-fading and indepen-
dent of each other. The fading coeﬃcients are con-
stant for a block of T symbol periods. Let CN (0,1)
denote the zero-mean, unit-variance, complex Gaus-
sian distribution. For the t-th block, the received sig-
nals are given by
Rt =
√
ρXtHt +Nt (5)
where Rt is the T ×nR matrix of received signals, Xt
is the T ×nT matrix of transmitted signals, Ht is the
nT × nR matrix of channel coeﬃcients whose entries
are CN (0,1), Nt is the T ×nR matrix of AWGN with
CN (0,1) entries, and ρ is the expected SNR at each
receiver antenna. For DSTM, the block length T is
always equal to nT , and two successive blocks have
the same fading coeﬃcients, i.e., Ht−1 = Ht.
Let InT denote the nT × nT identity matrix and †
denote conjugate transpose. In the DSTM scheme in
[7] and [8], Xt is determined by
Xt = Xt−1Ct (6)
where Ct is the nT ×nT data matrix which is unitary,
i.e., C†tCt = InT . The initial reference matrix X0 is
unitary, so all transmitted matrices Xt are unitary.
Let S′ = {C0,C1, · · · ,CK−1} denote the set of
Ct. If S
′ is a group (∀i, j ∈ {0, 1, · · · , K − 1},
∃k ∈ {0, 1, · · · , K − 1} such that CiCj = Ck) and
X0 ∈ S′, then Xt is always in S′. But if S′ is not
a group, the diﬀerential encoding by (6) may result
in Xt /∈ S and thus has constellation expansion. For
example, if Ct =
(
s1 s2
−s∗2 s∗1
)
for nT = 2 (the space-
time block code (STBC) in [26]) where s1 and s2 are
PSK symbols, the transmitted signals are not in the
PSK constellation any more. This DSTM which was
proposed in [9] and later explained in [10] is called
conventional DSTM using STBC hereafter.
Similar to the idea in [3], we propose a general def-
inition of DSTM as follows.
Definition 3: General diﬀerential encoding of
DSTM is a function that, for any Xt−1, maps data
bits bt to Xt = E(Xt−1,bt) such that for bt = b′t,
Xt = E(Xt−1,bt) = X′t = E(Xt−1,b′t).
The original deﬁnition of DSTM in [7] and [8] is to
map data bits bt to Ct ∈ S′ and then obtain Xt by
10
and Xt = X
at and use (at−1, at) to denote the DSTM
codeword hereafter.
In the following, consider the cases of M = 4
and M = 8. For both cases, conventional DSTM
using STBC in [9] and [10] is referred to for com-
parison. Note that for the conventional DSTM us-
ing STBC with Ct =
(
s1 s2
−s∗2 s∗1
)
≡ C(s1, s2), the
nearest-neighbor codewords are C(s1e
±j 2π
M , s2) and
C(s1, s2e
±j 2π
M ), so the average number of the nearest-
neighbor codewords is always 4.
Example 1 (DSTM with 2 bits/sec/Hz): Let
s1 and s2 be QPSK symbols. We use the al-
gorithms in [3] to construct the encoding table
and ﬁnd that the ﬁrst algorithm in Step 2 is
successful. There are 64 noncoherently indistinguish-
able codeword pairs, {(0, 0), (1, 1)}, {(0, 0), (2, 2)},
{(0, 0), (3, 3)}, {(0, 1), (2, 7)}, · · · , {(2, 14), (3, 9)}.
Table II shows the obtained optimal table of at
whose dmin is 0.5, in which the two codewords of
each noncoherently-indistinguishable codeword pair
belong to the same data bits. Among codes of DSTM
without constellation expansion for two transmit
antennas and 2 bits/sec/Hz, the codes from [7] and
[8] have the maximum value of dmin, which is only
0.3827 [11], [14]. Compared with the conventional
DSTM using STBC with 2 bits/sec/Hz whose signal
constellation is expanded from QPSK to 9QAM, our
DSTM has the same dmin while the used constellation
is QPSK only. However, the average number of the
nearest-neighbor codewords for our DSTM is 7.5.
Example 2 (DSTM with 3 bits/sec/Hz): Let s1 and
s2 be 8PSK symbols. We use the algorithms in [3] to
construct the encoding table and ﬁnd that the ﬁrst al-
gorithm in Step 2 is successful. The obtained optimal
table of at is presented in Table III, of which the i+2-
th column denotes at−1 = i and the i + 11-th column
denotes at−1 = i where 0 ≤ i ≤ 7. For any codeword
from this table denoted by (at−1 = i, at = j), another
codeword (at−1 = i + k, at = (j + k) mod 64) cor-
responds to the same bt for k = 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48
or 56. The encoding table has only dmin = 0.1464
but the average number of the nearest-neighbor code-
words is only 0.5. The second minimum noncoher-
ent distance is 0.2706 and the average number of the
second-nearest-neighbor codewords is 10.125. The
conventional DSTM using STBC with 3 bits/sec/Hz
whose s1 and s2 are 8PSK symbols has dmin = 0.2706.
The signal constellation of Example 2 is 8PSK while
the signal constellation of the DSTM using STBC is
expanded from 8PSK to a constellation with forty-one

H．Simulation Results of DSTM
Now consider the error performance of Example 1 and
Example 2. Simulation results for the quasi-static
ﬂat Rayleigh fading channel with nR = 2 are shown
in Fig. 9 in which solid curves denote 2 bits/sec/Hz
and dashed curves represent 3 bits/sec/Hz. It can
be found that among all DSTM with 2 bits/sec/Hz
and without constellation expansion, Example 1 is
the best.
Example 1 has the same dmin as conventional
DSTM using STBC for 2 bits/sec/Hz. However, pos-
sibly due to the number of nearest codewords, diﬀer-
ential detection without trellis for Example 1 is worse
than conventional DSTM using STBC. The gap be-
tween our code and conventional DSTM using STBC
for 3 bits/sec/Hz becomes larger than the gap for 2
bits/sec/Hz.
To improve the error performance, diﬀerential
detection by a trellis with the branch metric
‖R†t−1Xt−1 + R†tXt‖ and truncation length λ = 10
is used. At high SNRs, we ﬁnd that diﬀerential de-
tection using the Viterbi decoding for the proposed
DSTMs is similar to or slightly better than the con-
ventional DSTM using STBC.

五、 結果自評
In this report, we have proposed further results on
diﬀerential encoding by a table, for the transmitter,
the receiver, and multiple-antenna systems. For the
transmitter, we have proposed an algorithm for as-
signing data bits to groups by computers, and have
found some better constellations with corresponding
tables. In addition, multiple-symbol diﬀerential en-
coding is proposed, by which an example shows that
the number of reference symbols Nr > 1 has better
minimum noncoherent distance than Nr = 1. More-
over, to further enhance the error performance, dif-
ferential encoding concatenated with trellis coding is
also considered. For the receiver, we have proposed
a novel diﬀerential detection which uses a trellis dia-
gram to improve the BER. The suﬃcient number of
states in an equivalent trellis is derived as well. For
multiple-antenna systems, the proposed deﬁnition of
DSTM avoids constellation expansion. Two exam-
ples of DSTM are given. Compared with conventional
DSTM which suﬀer from constellation expansion, the
examples have similar BER at the price of the in-
creased decoding complexity.

為最難懂的還是印度口音。雖然每人報告時間大約只有 13分鐘，卻可以對
於各類研究有初步的認識，進而觸發出新想法。因為是第一次，自己在上台
報告時非常緊張，更何況要使用不熟悉的語言來報告，不過可能平常有演練，
所以報告過程還算順利的。當最後問答時間時並沒有很多人提問，我印象中
只有一位年輕學者針對我們的論文提出了關於不同系統複雜度的疑問，我是
在其他 session中則見識到了什麼叫做砲火猛烈，雖然我聽不是很懂他們做
說什麼。不過，這種經驗可以讓我學習到日後若有機會再度發表學術研究時，
如何應付問與答。這次在會場我發現大部分的學者都是結伴而來，而本人是
隻身前往，希望往後可以有幸和其他研究生可以一起參與會議。不過這次有
個收穫，本人在會場附近的公車站遇到了來自北京清華的暑期交換生，雖然
他還是個大學生，不過他自己就已經加入了研究室，進而來京都大學這裡學
習，這讓人非常的佩服。而關於此次的會議，可能是小型的會議，所以住宿
和交通都需要自己安排，所以本人住宿地點離會場有點距離，不過這也讓我
見識到了日本人日常生活，和他們的文化。
