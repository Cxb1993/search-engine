三、方法論 
 
A supply chain can be modeled as a network of 
stages that represent functionality that must be 
provided to transform raw materials to final products.  
Each stage may have one or more options that can 
satisfy required function.  A function might be the 
procurement of a raw material, the manufacture of an 
assembly, or the shipment of a product to a 
distribution center.  Each option at a stage can be 
characterized by two attributes: directed cost added 
and required lead-time.  The cost means the sum of 
the costs of all activities required to perform the 
functionality for a stage to satisfy the order (or deliver 
the service).  The lead-time is the amount of time 
that elapses from the instant that an order (or service 
request) is placed until it arrives.  Moreover, each 
stage is a potential location for holding a safety-stock 
inventory of the item processed at the stage to prevent 
inventory shortages.  Adequate inventory policy has 
to be determined for each stage to improve customer 
service by increasing on-time deliveries and at the 
same time utilizes fewer assets.   
The SC configuration model adapted from [13] 
is formulated as follows. 
N : total number of stages 
n : number of options at stage i 
iL
~  : the fuzzy replenishment lead-time of the 
item processed at stage i 
id
~

processed at stage i 
si  : the order-up-to level of the item processed 
at stage i 
Ri : the review period of stage i 
E~  : target service time 
h : the holding cost rate (the company’s time 
interval of interest) 
ci : cumulative cost of the item processed at 
stage i 
xi : selected option’s cost at stage i 
eik : directed cost added of option k at stage i 
ikv
~

it  : selected option’s fuzzy lead-time at stage i 
jτ~  : fuzzy material response time of stage j 
H : set storing precedence relationship 
between stages, H = {(j, i) | stage j 
precedes stage i} 
bij : the number of units of item processed at 
stage j required for one unit of item 
processed at a downstream stage i 
α : the company’s time interval of interest 
(days).

The objective of the proposed model is to 
minimize the SC configuration cost subjected to fulfill 
the specified customer service time and other related 
constraints at the same time.  The SC configuration 
cost consists of the safety stock cost and the pipeline 
stock cost for all stages as well as the cost of goods 
sold (COGS).  The cost and lead-time associated 
with the option chosen at each stage is given in 
constraints (2) and (3).  Constraint (4) enforces that 
only one option is chosen for each stage.  Constraint 
(5) calculates the cumulative cost at each stage.  
Constraint (6) calculates the replenishment lead-time 
of an inventory item at each stage and it will be 
explained in the next section.  The demand of the 
inventory item at each stage is calculated by the 
aggregated demands from downstream stages and is 
defined in constraint (7).  Constraint (8) specifies 
that the order-up-to level of the inventory item at each 
stage is the quantity of the demand during the 
replenishment lead-time plus one review period.  
Constraint (9) assures that the end-product service 
time obtained by the chosen SC configuration has to 
fulfill the target service time.  The end-product 
service time is defined as the sum of the fuzzy 
lead-time and the fuzzy material response time of the 
final stage on SC.  Constraint (10) enforces that yik 
for all i, k are set to binary variables. 
The fuzzy material response time kτ~  at stage k 
is defined as the possibility distribution of the waiting 
time for a customer order that has to wait to be 
fulfilled.  Since the periodic review policy is used, 
the order-up-to level sk of inventory item at stage k is 
set to the quantity of the demand during the 
replenishment lead-time kL
~  plus one review period 
Rk.  Therefore, given an order-up-to level sk, the 
 4
level of stage P3 was dropped at the same time, as the 
shorter lead-time option was chosen.  The incurred 
higher product cost might be compensated by the 
lower inventory investment. 
For stages S1, S2, the first and second options 
were chosen interchangeably, depending on the 
particular ρ value.  One of the reasons is that neither 
stage for supplying notebook covers was on the 
“critical” supply chain like stage P3.  Therefore, 
neither stage had significant impacts on the target 
end-product service time.  By either selecting a 
shorter lead-time option or investing in more safety 
stocks, it was able to achieve the target service time. 
The above results show that a risk-averse 
decision maker may prefer either to use the option 
with a shorter lead-time but a higher cost or to allocate 
adequate safety-stock investment on a certain stage to 
build a more responsive SC [5].  However, it is not 
possible to improve the responsiveness of a SC at no 
cost.  As the value of ρ increases, the total SC cost 
increases.  In addition, although selecting an option 
with a shorter lead-time can reduce the inventory 
investment for the stage, it may lead to a higher 
product cost.  Depending on the nature of product 
demand and the risk attitude of decision makers, the 
proposed SC configuration model can assist decision 
makers in analyzing trade-offs among customer 
service time, inventory investment (in terms of safety 
stock and pipeline stock costs) and product cost (in 
terms of COGS).  Please refer to [17] for the detailed 
discussion of computational experiments. 
 
 
六、計畫成果自評 
 
This project developed a fuzzy SC model to 
determine the optimal SC configuration and inventory 
decisions.  In addition to the probabilistic-based 
approach in the literature, the proposed model may 
provide an alternative approach to make SC 
configuration decisions.  Comparing to the fuzzy SC 
model developed in the literature, the approach 
developed in this paper can evaluate the entire SC 
directly and allow decision makers to express their 
risk attitudes to analyze the trade-off among customer 
service levels, product cost, and inventory investment 
in SC.  Depending on the nature of product demand 
and the risk attitude of decision makers, the proposed 
SC configuration model can assist decision makers in 
evaluating and selecting appropriate SC 
configurations for new products in the situation where 
there is lack of certainty in data or even lack of 
available historical data. 
We have accomplished 95% of the expected result 
of this project.  The result of this two-year project 
was accepted by the international journal: Fuzzy Sets 
and Systems [16] and European Journal of 
Operational Research [17].  Please refer to [16, 17] 
for details of the proposed methodology and 
computational experiments.
