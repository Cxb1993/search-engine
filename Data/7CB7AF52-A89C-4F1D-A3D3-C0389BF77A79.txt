 Solar cells are one of the most promising devices in search of sustainable renewable sources 
of energy. Although silicon-based photovoltaic devices have dominated the field, new generations 
of solar cells are emerging. Solid-state dye sensitized solar cell (SS-DSSC) has been the subject 
of intense study due to the practical advantages as compared to existing electrolyte junction cells, 
for example, electrolyte leakage, thermal instability and poor long-term stability. The structure of 
SS-DSSC possesses a unique p-type material which plays a key role for hole transportation and 
the restoration of charge neutrality. Thus, as the next-generation solar cell, it is essential to 
fabricate a high quality p-type hole conductor for SS-DSSC with excellent performance: high 
conversion efficiency and superior long-term stability. High quality ZnO nanorod arrays were 
synthesized by a two-step chemical bath deposition (CBD) on ITO substrate. Our synthesis 
method is a two-step process: seeding and subsequent growth. The thickness of the ZnO seeded 
layer is about 170 nm. The CBD was carried out in zinc acetate solution at 95 °C for 1 hour, 
followed by heat treatment at different temperatures. The structural and optical properties of the 
ZnO were investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and optical 
transmission spectroscopy. The XRD results showed that the CBD ZnO nanorods have a 
hexagonal wurtzite structure with flat-tops as seen in SEM morphologies. The diameter of ZnO 
nanorods was found to be in the range of 380-450 nm and the length was up to 1.3 μm depending 
on the heat-treatment temperature. An average optical transmittance of more than 90% was 
obtained in the wavelength range 400-800 nm for heating temperature of 400 °C, where the 
length/diameter ratio reached maximum value of 3.08. The ZnO branched nanorods fabricated by 
this two-step CBD at low temperature exhibited great crystal quality, leading to excellent 
electrical properties (ρ = 3.2x10-3 Ω-cm) and high carrier mobility (μ = 40.4 cm2/V-sec). The 
CBD-ZnO/p-NiO homojunction electrodes have also been prepared to investigate its rectifying 
behavior.

1. Introduction 
Zinc oxide (ZnO) is an interesting n-type semiconducting oxide materials because of its 
unique chemical and physical properties such as wide and direct band gap (3.37 eV), large 
binding energy (60 meV) [1, 2], high-electrical conductivity and transparency in the visible 
region [3]. Nanostructured ZnO materials with large surface area have received intensive research 
for applications of photodiodes [4], photodetectors [5], diode lasers [6], biochemical sensors [7], 
photovoltaic cells [8], thin-film transistors [9] and other nanodevices [10, 11]. ZnO prepared by 
different deposition technologies provide films of different morphologies. Thin films of ZnO can 
be produced by rf magnetron sputtering [12, 13], pulsed laser deposition (PLD) [14] and sol-gel 
process [3, 15]. For nanorod arrays of ZnO, the growth techniques include chemical bath 
deposition [16], spray pyrolysis [17], vapor phase transport [18] and hydrothermal method [19]. 
Sol-gel method can also be employed to prepare ZnO nanorods; however, sintering temperature 
must be higher than 900 °C [20]. Among these techniques, chemical bath deposition (CBD) is a 
simple, economical, large area coating and low-temperature process, which is compatible with 
plastic substrates for the fabrication of nanostructured ZnO. However, to the best of our 
knowledge, ZnO prepared either by CBD [21] or chemical solution method [22] shows a poor 
reproducibility due to the difficulty in controlling the size and uniform coverage on the substrate, 
which directly results in poor electrical and optical properties of the ZnO nanostructures [22]. 
 
ZnO nanorod arrays by CBD have been grown on Si [21] and glass substrates [23]. The 
nanorods were well aligned with oriented in the c-axis direction; the diameters were ranged from 
40 to 150 nm [16] and the lengths are about 400 nm [21]. It is important that, before CBD growth, 
the substrates must receive pre-treatment in aqueous solutions followed by annealing at high 
temperatures [16, 21, 24]. Nanostructured ZnO demonstrated different optical and structural 
properties depending on the preparing conditions. It has been reported that the optical 
transmittance is 80-90% and ~90% for sol-gel ZnO [3, 15] and CBD ZnO [23], respectively. We 
have found a few works reporting the structural studies of ZnO thin films and nanorods [15, 16, 
All the aqueous solutions were prepared using distilled water. Finally, the samples were rinsed 
with deionized water and then dried at room temperature to remove any residuals and organic 
materials. 
 
2.2 Material and electrical characterizations 
The surface morphology and cross-section views of the nanostructures were examined by 
field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-6700F). X-ray diffraction (XRD) 
was employed to characterize the crystalline structure of the synthesized ZnO in the 2θ range 
20-80°. The optical transmittance of the ZnO nanorods was measured in the wavelength range of 
300-800 nm by using an UV-visible spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer Lambda 20). In addition, 
the electrical properties of the synthesized ZnO nanorod arrays were measured with the Hall 
measurement system (Ecopia HMS-3000) at room temperature using van der Pauw’s method. 
 
3. Results and discussion 
 Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the commercial ZnO powder (Showa, purity 99%) and the 
ZnO prepared at different heat treatment temperatures. It can be seen that the ZnO has been 
synthesized at low heating temperature (200 °C) with Zn(OH)2 remained by the observation of 
supplementary peaks in a range of 20° to 30°. The Zn(OH)2 was converted into ZnO by heating at 
higher temperature (300-600 °C). No significant differences were observed for the synthesized 
ZnO treated at 400-600 °C; diffraction peaks (100), (002) and (101) can be indexed to the 
wurtzite structure [22]. The diffraction peaks with less intensity over a range from 40° to 80° are 
approved of randomly oriented of the ZnO nanorods. 
 
Typical SEM images of the ZnO seeding layer are shown in Fig. 2. Fig 2(a) shows the 
overall morphology of the seeded layer with oriented nanorod arrays and few individual nanorods. 
The thickness of the seeded layer is around 170 nm as observed from the cross-section of the 
SEM micrographs (Fig. 2(b)). Fig. 3 shows the SEM morphologies of the synthesized ZnO 
nanorods treated at different heating temperatures. The ZnO nanorods at the condition of 400 °C 
possess the maximum length/diameter (L/D) ratio with value of 3.08. All the top surfaces of the 
materials [13]. Thus the change of the crystallinity and crystal quality would greatly affect the 
change of the resistivity and the mobility. Our results show the synthesized ZnO nanorods 
possess great and similar crystal quality, which leads to the excellent electrical properties. It has 
also been reported that the impurity scattering is a dominant factor on mobility, due to the 
tightness of the films deposited at high temperature [31]. The ZnO nanorods synthesized at low 
temperature in this work show similar electrical properties, implying the impurity scattering is not 
severe even after the following heat treatment. Note that the Hall mobility of the CBD ZnO (μ = 
40.4 cm2/V-sec) is higher than Al-ZnO films by sputtering (μ = 15.6 cm2/V-sec) [13] and PLD (μ 
= 27 cm2/V-sec) [14], indicating that the electron transportation is enhanced in nanorods rather 
than in thin films. We also incorporated NiO with the CBD-ZnO to fabricate the ZnO/NiO 
hetrojunction electrode, which demonstrates greatest rectification characteristic (slope~4.35 
mA/V) as compared to other oxide junctions [32]. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 We have synthesized highly transparent and low-resistivity ZnO nanorods on ITO substrates 
by two-step CBD method at low temperature. The seeded layer with thickness of 170 nm is 
observed with oriented nanorod arrays. From the analysis of the XRD and SEM, the ZnO 
nanorods were formed with hexagonal wurtzite structure during CBD. A structural study revealed 
that dimension of ZnO nanorods increases with increasing heating temperature, but the crystal 
quality remain unchanged from the analysis of XRD patterns. The nanorods were observed in the 
range of 380-450 nm in diameter and 0.98-1.32 μm in length. The average transmittance is higher 
than 90% in the visible wavelength region (400-800 nm) for ZnO heat-treated at 400 °C due to 
the highest length/diameter ratio (value = 3.08). The fabricated ZnO nanorods exhibit low 
resistivity of the order of 10-3 Ω-cm, high mobility (35.2-40.4 cm2/V-sec) and high carrier 
concentration (4.4-21.4x1019 cm-3). It is concluded that heating treatment of 400 °C is optimum 
for ZnO branched nanorods to achieve great coverage, high optical transmittance and excellent 
electrical resistivity. Experimental data clearly revealed that the electron transportation is 
significantly enhanced in nanorods rather than in thin films. Further, the ZnO/NiO hetrojunction 
electrode demonstrates greatest rectification characteristic (slope~4.35 mA/V) as compared to

二、心得與建議： 
 
此次會議在上海舉行，為亞洲規模相當大的矽(Silicon)半導體技術國際會議，本
人觀察到許多當地的企業如 Anji、Gritek 以及中國重點大學如: 北京大學、復旦
大學及浙江大學亦發表其最新研究成果。來自全球的學府包括美國知名大學(如
柏克萊大學、史丹福大學、MIT、耶魯大學)亦受邀參與，顯示中國已吸引全球
半導體研究機構注意到其展現突破半導體技術的旺盛企圖心，同時藉由與中國學
界的多層次交流(業界、學界、研究生)，正快速縮短中國與世界各國半導體的距
離。台灣對大陸舉辦之國際會議相對於歐美較不重視，然而個人認為大陸地區的
國際化及舉辦國際級會議仍然有值得台灣借鏡之處，如會議補助、會議地點選
擇、會議規模，都相當有國際水準。本屆大會特別安排與會人士參訪上海市區，
亦增加各國學者對中國及上海的親和力。由於台灣學生將來有可能在上海工作，
建議學校能鼓勵研究生多參與中國的相關國際研討會，這也是台灣學子全球化的
一條捷徑。
