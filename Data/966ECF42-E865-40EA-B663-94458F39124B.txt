A systematic method for solving biharmonic problems with circular 
boundaries by using the degenerate kernel 
 
Abstract 
The null-field integral equation method in conjunction with Fourier series and 
degenerate kernels are proposed to solve the biharmonic problems with circular 
boundaries. The degenerate kernels in the BIEM are expanded by using the technique of 
separating the field point and source point. The improper boundary integrals are novelly 
avoided since the appropriate interior and exterior expansions of degenerate kernels are 
used. The unknown boundary densities are expressed in terms of Fourier series and the 
unknown Fourier coefficients can be easily determined by using the collocation method. 
Finally, the numerical solutions for problems of plate and Stokes flow are compared 
with the data of finite element solution (ABAQUS) and previous results to demonstrate 
the validity of the present method.

1. Introduction 
The boundary element method (BEM) by discretizing the boundary integral 
equation (BIE) has been extensively applied for solving engineering problems more 
than domain type methods, e.g. finite element methods (FEM) or finite difference 
methods (FDM). However, it is noted that improper integrals on the boundary should be 
handled with care when BEM is used. In the past, many researchers proposed several 
regularization techniques to deal with the singularity and hypersingularity. To determine 
the Cauchy principal value (CPV) and the Hadamard principal value (HPV) in the 
singular and hypersingular integrals is a critical issue in the BEM/BIEM. In this project, 
instead of using the definitions of CPV and HPV, the kernel function is described in an 
analytical form on each side (interior and exterior) by employing the separating

where F.P. denotes the finite part for all the improper integrals. When the field point x  
outside the domain, the null-field integral equations are yielded as follows: 
∫∫ Θ+−= BB sdBsmxssdBsvxsU )()(),()()(),(0

where cΩ  is the complementary domain of Ω .

Since the introduction of the degenerate kernels [7], the formulation can be 
rewritten as follows:

are shown in Fig.1. We call this treatment as “vector decomposition technique.” 
 
3. Numerical examples 
Case 1: circular plate with three holes 
A circular plate with the three circular holes solved by Bird and Steele [2] is 
considered. The geometric data and the essential boundary conditions are shown in 
Fig.2. The contour plots of displacement by using different number of terms in the 
Fourier series (M=10, 20, 30, 40, 50) are shown in Figs.3(a)~3(e). The case was also 
solved by using the software of FEM (ABAQUS) with 6,606 triangle elements as 
shown in Fig.3(g). Good agreement among the data of Bird and Steele [2] (Fig.3(f)), 
ABAQUS results [1] (Fig.3(h)) and present solutions is made. 
 
Case 2: Stokes flow of eccentric cylinder 
The present method is also extended to solve the slow flow between eccentric 
cylinders since the stream function satisfies the biharmonic equation. The inner cylinder 
is rotating with a constant angular velocity and the outer one is stationary as shown in 
Fig.4. The following parameters are defined: R1, radius of inner cylinder; R2, radius of 
outer cylinder; 12 RRc −= , the clearance; ce /=ε , the eccentricity; e, separation of 
centers of cylinders; 1ω  for the anticlockwise angular velocity of inner cylinder. The 
essential boundary conditions are specified as follows: 
1)( usu = , 5.0)()( 11 ==∂
∂= r
n
sus ωθ , s on B1, (17)
0)( =su , 0)()( =∂
∂=

It is noted that the boundary condition 1u  is an unknown constant along the inner 
boundary. An additional constraint is required to ensure a unique solution.

Abstract  In this talk, the development of dual BEM is reviewed since its appearance in 1986 by Hong and 
Chen. Roles of hypersigularity are also examined in the computational mechanics. A novel method using 
the SVD (singular value decomposition) for problems with degenerate boundaries was proposed without 
employing hypersingular formulation and subdomain approach in 2003. Some traps of BEM in 
engineering applications, degenerate scale,  spurious eigenvalues and fictitious frequencies, are 
investigated. We provide a perspective on the nonuniqueness and its treatment, including degenerate 
boundary, degenerate scale, spurious eigensolution, fictitious frequency and corner problems as shown in 
Table 1, in the boundary integral formulation and boundary element method (BEM). All the 
nonuniqueness problems originate from the rank deficiency in the influence matrix. Both the Fredholm 
alternative theorem and SVD technique are employed to study the nonuniqueness problems. Based on the 
circulant properties and degenerate kernels as analytical tools for circular and annular cases, mathematical 
analysis can be done. Updating terms and updating documents of the SVD technique are utilized. The roles 
of right and left unitary vectors of SVD in BEM and their relations to true, spurious and fictitious modes 
are examined by using the Fredholm alternative theorem. Two methods, CHIEF and CHEEF techniques, 
for dealing with the nonuniqueness problems in BEM are proposed. Null-fields of nonuniqueness 
problems are shown in Table 2. The related works since 1984 are shown in Table 3. The three-years 
project on this topic supported by NSC Wu Ta-You Award is also shown in Table 4. Only key references 
of NTOU/MSV group are contained here.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The boundary integral equation method (BIEM) and the boundary element method (BEM) have received 
much attention since Rizzo proposed a numerical treatment of the boundary integral equation for 
elastostatics. Most of the efforts have been focused on the singular boundary integral equation for primary 
fields, e.g. potential or displacement. For most problems, the formulation of a singular boundary integral 
equation for the primary field provides sufficient conditions to ensure a unique solution. In some cases, 
e.g., those with Hermite polynomial elements, degenerate boundaries, corners, the construction of a 
symmetric matrix, the improvement of condition numbers, the construction of an image system, the 
tangent flux or hoop stress calculation on the boundary, an error indicator in the adaptive BEM, fictitious 
(irregular) frequencies in exterior acoustics, spurious eigenvalues, degenerate scale, the free surface 
seepage flow and the Tikhonov formulation for inverse problems, it is found that the integral 
representation for a primary field (Cauchy integral formula) can not provide sufficient constraints. In other 
words, the influence matrices are rank deficient. It is well known now that the hypersingular equation 
plays an important role in the aforementioned problems. Mathematicians and engineers have paid attention 
to the hypersingular equation from the viewpoint of mathematics and engineering, respectively. A review 
article by Chen and Hong on hypersingularity can be found. The hypersingular formulation provides the 
theoretical base of BIE for degenerate boundary problems. Natural boundary element method by Feng and 
Yu also focused on the hypersingular formulation. Totally speaking, four degenerate problems in BEM, 
degenerate scale, degenerate boundary, spurious eigenvalues and fictitious frequency, are encountered. In 
 
2.4 Spurious eigenvalues in the dual multiple reciprocity method (MRM) and the real-part BEM for 
simply-connected eigen problems as well as the complex-valued BEM for multiply-connected eigen 
problems  
The conventional MRM result is spurious eigenvalues. To deal with this problem the dual MRM provides 
an ideal framework to solve the eigenproblems by using the real-valued computation. To distinguish 
whether the eigenvalue is true or not, Chen and Wong applied a hypersingular MRM formulation to obtain 
sufficient constraints for the eigenequations. The dual formulation for the MRM has also been successfully 
extended to solve the acoustic modes for a two-dimensional cavity with an incomplete partition. The 
singular value decomposition (SVD) technique can also be used to filter out spurious eigenvalues for an 
overdeterminate system in the dual MRM. Another advantage by using the SVD for the overdetermined 
system in the dual MRM was its ability to determine the multiplities of the eigenvalues. Moreover, a 
series-type complex-valued dual BEM called the complete MRM was derived by Yeih et al. Five methods, 
the complete MRM, the complex-valued dual BEM, the real-part dual BEM, the imaginary-part dual 
BEM, and the conventional dual MRM, were summarized in the WCCM 4 keynote lecture by Chen. 
Regarding to the complex-valued BEM, it is found that spurious eigenvalues also appear for the multiply 
connected eigen problems. Both the annular membrane and plate as well as eccentric cases were 
theoretically and numerically demonstrated to show the appearance of spurious eigenvalues which exactly 
match the true eigenvalue of the domain bounded by the inner boundary. Not only BEM but also method of 
fundamental solutions (MFS) result in spurious eigenvalues. 
 
2.5 Fictitious frequencies (irregular values) 
It is worth noting that the dual integral equations in acoustic applications received much attention earlier 
than did the Laplace problem since the exterior problem using the singular integral equation with the 
weakly singular and strongly singular kernels resulted in fictitious eigenfrequencies. Although Schenck 
found a unique solution by using the CHIEF method, which is generally preferred by the engineering 
community, this method has limitations. For example, it can not be used to solve the exterior problem with 
a degenerate boundary (such as a noise barrier) since an interior point is not available. Burton and Miller 
were first to propose the combined use of dual integral representation for the acoustic problem with all 
wave numbers. Terai applied dual integral equations to the acoustic problem with the degenerate boundary 
of a screen. Wu and Wan also applied dual integral equations to the acoustic radiation and scattering 
problems for thin bodies. For the indirect method, Brakhage and Werner employed the mixed-potential 
approach. Several researchers have dealt with hypersingularity to overcome the fictitious-frequency 
problems. The available methods have been summarized from the viewpoint of the dual integral 
representation. From this viewpoint, the fictitious frequencies depend on the kernel of the integral 
representation of the solution and on the location where the singularity is distributed. In other words, the 
boundary condition can not change the position of fictitious frequencies once the integral representation is 
chosen. To demonstrate that these statements are true, Chen has given three examples for one-, two- and 
three-dimensional problems by using the indirect method and the direct method. In the three examples, the 
degenerate kernels in the frequency domain have been employed to represent the potentials in the interior 
and exterior domains. The analytical results can be obtained and the mechanism of fictitious frequencies 
can be easily understood upon considering the difference of the stiffness matrix between the exterior and 
interior problems. Therefore, some misleading comments by Shaw and Rizzo have been corrected. 
Besides, the mathematical structures of the four matrices, U, T, L and M can be unified by using the SVD. 
It is found that fictitious modes are imbedded in the left unitary vectors of the influence matrix after using 
the SVD while true modes are given in the right unitary vectors. 
 
2.6 Corner problem 
The corner problem with the Dirichlet boundary condition is another problem in which the number of 
equations is not sufficient for the conventional BEM. The double-node technique was utilized to tackle 
this problem. Researchers have tried to find better and additional constraints. Again, the hypersingular 
integral formulation plays a role in providing independent constraints for the boundary unknowns. For the 
case that the displacement (or potential) is specified at the corner, the traction (or potential flux) unknowns 
the above statement that the inversion of a matrix with diagonal dominance is numerically stable. Also, the 
properties of Caleron projector can be found. 
 
2.11 The Tikhonov formulation for inverse problems with overspecified boundary conditions 
In solving an ill-posed inverse problem with overspecified boundary conditions by the Tikhonov 
formulation, double boundary integrals occur naturally. The inner integrals in the double integrals are   
hypersingular. To avoid hypersingularity, Yeih, Koya and Mura employed a fictitious BEM to deal with 
the inverse problem. Fictitious BEM proposed by Yeih et al. is not absolutely necessary since the 
hypersingular integral can be evaluated by using the regularization techniques. 
 
2.12 Free-surface problems 
The free-surface  problem can be treated as a moving boundary problem with overspecified boundary 
conditions. An iterative scheme for the free-surface seepage was proposed by Niwa using the conventional 
BEM. By employing the hypersingular integral equation, the rate of convergence can be accelerated. The 
number of iteration using the hypersingular equation is lower than that using the singular formulation. 
 
2.13 Construction of the image system 
In the half-plane, half-space, quarter-plane or quarter space problems, special Green's functions subjected 
to certain boundary conditions are often used as auxiliary systems to establish integral equations which 
can eliminate integrations on the rectilinear or plane boundaries such as the ground surface. 
Conventionally, we always locate the source outside the domain to adjust for the satisfaction of  boundary 
conditions. Based on the physical meaning of the dual integral equations in potential theory, an additional 
degree of freedom for adjusting is available, which is the normal vector of the dipole  or dislocation source. 
Illustrative examples have been given in the book by Chen and Hong. 
 
3. RANK DEFICIENCY IN BEM/BIEM 
3.1  Degenerate boundary in boundary value problems 
For the problem with a degenerate boundary, the dual integral representation has been proposed for crack 
problems in elasticity by Hong and Chen, and boundary element researchers have increasingly paid 
attention to the second equation of the dual representation. The second equation, which is derived for the 
secondary field, e.g., flux or traction, is very popular now and is termed the hypersingular boundary 
integral equation. Hong and Chen presented the theoretical bases of the dual integral equations and a 
general formulation which incorporates the displacement and traction boundary integral equations. Huang 
and So extended the concept of he Hadamard principal value in the dual integral equations to determine the 
dynamic stress intensity factors of multiple cracks.  Gray also independently found the hypersingular 
integral representations for the Laplace equation and the Navier equation although he did not coin the 
formulation “dual”. Martin, Rizzo and Gonsalves called the new kernel in the dual integral equations  
“hypersingular” while Kaya  earlier called the kernel “superstrong singularity”. Since the formulation was 
derived for the secondary field, by analogy with the term “natural boundary condition”, Feng and Yu  
called the method ``natural BEM" or ``canonical integral equations''. Balas, Sladek and Sladek in their 
book proposed a unified theory for crack problems by using the displacement boundary integral equation 
and another integro-differential equation for the traction field. Based on the dual integral representation for 
the degenerate boundary problems, Hong and Chen developed the dual BEM programs for crack and 
potential flow problems with a cutoff wall. Besides, Chen and his coworkers extended the dual BEM 
program for the Laplace equation and the Navier equation to three programs. One is for the Helmholtz 
equation by the dual MRM. Another is for the Helmholtz equation by the complex-valued formulation.The 
other is for the modified Helmholtz equation. A general purpose program, BEASY, was developed for 
crack problems by the Wessex Institute of Technology (WIT) and termed the ``dual boundary element 
method (DBEM)" . This program has been extended to solve crack growth problems more efficiently by 
using  the benefit of the single-domain approach. Chen and Hong, Mi and Aliabadi  extended 
two-dimensional cases to three-dimensional crack problems. A program implemented by Lutz et al. was 
also reported. In the mathematical literature, the relationships between the boundary integral operators and 
various layer potentials are obtainable through the so-called Calderon projector. Four identities to relate 
harmonic equation and the biharmonic equation and the possible degenerate scales were investigated. 
Hypersingular formulation is an alternative to study the degenerate scale problems for simply-connected 
problems, since eigenvalues are never zero. Another simple approach is to superimpose a rigid body 
motion in the fundamental solution so that the zero eigenvalue can be shifted to be nonzero. However, this 
treatment results in another degenerate scale. By employing the CHIEF concept, a CHEEF approach was 
developed to obtain the independent constraint. A unified method was proposed to study the problem by 
using the Fredholm alternative theorem and the SVD updating technique. Both the spurious mode 
(mathematically realizable) and rigid body mode (physically realizable) can be determined. The left and 
right unitary matrices in the SVD for BEM are found to be the true and spurious modes. In addition, a 
direct treatment in the matrix operation instead of adding a rigid body term in the fundamental solution can 
be derived. The general proof of degenerate scale for eccentric Laplace problems was obtained to show the 
outer radius of one is the critical value.  
 
3.3 Spurious eigensolutions for interior eigenproblems 
For interior problems, eigendata are very important informations in vibrations and acoustics. According to 
the complex-valued boundary element method, the eigenvalues and eigenmodes can be determined. 
Nevertheless, complex arithmetic is required. To avoid complex arithmetic, many approaches including 
the multiple reciprocity method (MRM), the real-part and the imaginary-part BEMs have been proposed. 
For example, Tai and Shaw employed only real-part kernel in the integral formulation. A simplified 
method using only the real-part or imaginary-part kernel was also presented by De Mey, Yasko and 
Hutchinson. Although De Mey found that the zeros for a real-part of the complex determinant may be 
different from the determinant by using the real-part kernel, the spurious eigensolutions were not 
discovered analytically. Chen and Wong  and Yeih et al. found the spurious eigensolutions analytically in 
the MRM by using simple examples of rod and beam, respectively. Later, Kamiya et al. and Yeih  et al. 
independently claimed that MRM is no more than the real-part BEM. Kang et al. employed the 
Nondimensional Dynamic Influence Function method (NDIF) to solve the eigenproblem. Chen et al. 
commented that the NDIF method is a special case of imaginary-part BEM. Kang and Lee also found the 
spurious eigensolutions and filtered out the spurious eigenvalues by using the net approach. Later, they 
extended to solve plate vibration problems. Chen  et al. proposed a double-layer potential approach to filter 
out the spurious eigenmodes. The reason why spurious eigenvalues occur in the real-part BEM is the loss 
of the constraints, which was investigated by Yeih et al.. The spurious eigensolutions and fictitious 
frequencies arise from an improper approximation of the null space operator. The fewer number of 
constraint equations makes the solution space larger. Spurious eigensolutions were also found in the 
Maxwell equation. The spurious eigensolutions can be filtered out by using many alternatives, e.g., the 
complex-valued BEM, the domain partition technique, the dual formulation in conjunction with the SVD 
updating techniques and the CHEEF(Combined Helmholtz Exterior integral Equation Formulation) 
method. Besides, the spurious eigensolution for the multiply-connected problem was found even though 
the complex-valued kernel was used. A unified formulation to study the phenomenon was proposed by 
using the Fredholm alternative theorem and the SVD technique. The SVD updating techniques in 
conjunction with the dual formulation was employed to sort out the true and spurious eigenvalues. In 
addition, the relation between the left unitary vector in the SVD and the spurious mode was constructed by 
NTOU/MSV group. 
 
3.4 Fictitious frequency in exterior acoustics 
For exterior acoustics, the solution to the boundary is unique for all wave numbers. This is not the case for 
the numerical treatment of integral equation formulation, which breaks down at certain frequency known 
as irregular frequency or fictitious frequency. This problem is completely nonphysical because there are 
no discrete eigenvalues for the exterior problems. It was found that the singular  (UT) equation results in 
fictitious frequencies which are associated with the interior eigenfrequency of the Dirichlet problems 
while the hypersingular (LM) equation produces fictitious frequencies which are associated with the 
interior eigenfrequency of the Neumann problems. The general derivation was provided in a continuous 
system, and a discrete system was analytically studied by using the properties of circulant for a circular 
case. Schenck proposed a CHIEF (Combined Helmholtz Interior integral Equation Formulation) method,

Abstract  In this talk, the development of dual BEM is reviewed since its appearance in 1986 by Hong and 
Chen. Roles of hypersigularity are also examined in the computational mechanics. A novel method using 
the SVD (singular value decomposition) for problems with degenerate boundaries was proposed without 
employing hypersingular formulation and subdomain approach in 2003. Some traps of BEM in 
engineering applications, degenerate scale,  spurious eigenvalues and fictitious frequencies, are 
investigated. We provide a perspective on the nonuniqueness and its treatment, including degenerate 
boundary, degenerate scale, spurious eigensolution, fictitious frequency and corner problems as shown in 
Table 1, in the boundary integral formulation and boundary element method (BEM). All the 
nonuniqueness problems originate from the rank deficiency in the influence matrix. Both the Fredholm 
alternative theorem and SVD technique are employed to study the nonuniqueness problems. Based on the 
circulant properties and degenerate kernels as analytical tools for circular and annular cases, mathematical 
analysis can be done. Updating terms and updating documents of the SVD technique are utilized. The roles 
of right and left unitary vectors of SVD in BEM and their relations to true, spurious and fictitious modes 
are examined by using the Fredholm alternative theorem. Two methods, CHIEF and CHEEF techniques, 
for dealing with the nonuniqueness problems in BEM are proposed. Null-fields of nonuniqueness 
problems are shown in Table 2. The related works since 1984 are shown in Table 3. The three-years 
project on this topic supported by NSC Wu Ta-You Award is also shown in Table 4. Only key references 
of NTOU/MSV group are contained here. 
 
Key words:  dual BEM, dual BIEM, rank deficiency, degenerate problem, spurious eigenvalue and

1. INTRODUCTION 
The boundary integral equation method (BIEM) and the boundary element method (BEM) have received 
much attention since Rizzo proposed a numerical treatment of the boundary integral equation for 
elastostatics. Most of the efforts have been focused on the singular boundary integral equation for primary 
fields, e.g. potential or displacement. For most problems, the formulation of a singular boundary integral 
equation for the primary field provides sufficient conditions to ensure a unique solution. In some cases, 
e.g., those with Hermite polynomial elements, degenerate boundaries, corners, the construction of a 
symmetric matrix, the improvement of condition numbers, the construction of an image system, the 
tangent flux or hoop stress calculation on the boundary, an error indicator in the adaptive BEM, fictitious 
(irregular) frequencies in exterior acoustics, spurious eigenvalues, degenerate scale, the free surface 
seepage flow and the Tikhonov formulation for inverse problems, it is found that the integral 
representation for a primary field (Cauchy integral formula) can not provide sufficient constraints. In other 
words, the influence matrices are rank deficient. It is well known now that the hypersingular equation 
plays an important role in the aforementioned problems. Mathematicians and engineers have paid attention 
to the hypersingular equation from the viewpoint of mathematics and engineering, respectively. A review 
article by Chen and Hong on hypersingularity can be found. The hypersingular formulation provides the 
theoretical base of BIE for degenerate boundary problems. Natural boundary element method by Feng and 
Yu also focused on the hypersingular formulation. Totally speaking, four degenerate problems in BEM, 
degenerate scale, degenerate boundary, spurious eigenvalues and fictitious frequency, are encountered. In 
 
2.4 Spurious eigenvalues in the dual multiple reciprocity method (MRM) and the real-part BEM for 
simply-connected eigen problems as well as the complex-valued BEM for multiply-connected eigen 
problems  
The conventional MRM result is spurious eigenvalues. To deal with this problem the dual MRM provides 
an ideal framework to solve the eigenproblems by using the real-valued computation. To distinguish 
whether the eigenvalue is true or not, Chen and Wong applied a hypersingular MRM formulation to obtain 
sufficient constraints for the eigenequations. The dual formulation for the MRM has also been successfully 
extended to solve the acoustic modes for a two-dimensional cavity with an incomplete partition. The 
singular value decomposition (SVD) technique can also be used to filter out spurious eigenvalues for an 
overdeterminate system in the dual MRM. Another advantage by using the SVD for the overdetermined 
system in the dual MRM was its ability to determine the multiplities of the eigenvalues. Moreover, a 
series-type complex-valued dual BEM called the complete MRM was derived by Yeih et al. Five methods, 
the complete MRM, the complex-valued dual BEM, the real-part dual BEM, the imaginary-part dual 
BEM, and the conventional dual MRM, were summarized in the WCCM 4 keynote lecture by Chen. 
Regarding to the complex-valued BEM, it is found that spurious eigenvalues also appear for the multiply 
connected eigen problems. Both the annular membrane and plate as well as eccentric cases were 
theoretically and numerically demonstrated to show the appearance of spurious eigenvalues which exactly 
match the true eigenvalue of the domain bounded by the inner boundary. Not only BEM but also method of 
fundamental solutions (MFS) result in spurious eigenvalues. 
 
2.5 Fictitious frequencies (irregular values) 
It is worth noting that the dual integral equations in acoustic applications received much attention earlier 
than did the Laplace problem since the exterior problem using the singular integral equation with the 
weakly singular and strongly singular kernels resulted in fictitious eigenfrequencies. Although Schenck 
found a unique solution by using the CHIEF method, which is generally preferred by the engineering 
community, this method has limitations. For example, it can not be used to solve the exterior problem with 
a degenerate boundary (such as a noise barrier) since an interior point is not available. Burton and Miller 
were first to propose the combined use of dual integral representation for the acoustic problem with all 
wave numbers. Terai applied dual integral equations to the acoustic problem with the degenerate boundary 
of a screen. Wu and Wan also applied dual integral equations to the acoustic radiation and scattering 
problems for thin bodies. For the indirect method, Brakhage and Werner employed the mixed-potential 
approach. Several researchers have dealt with hypersingularity to overcome the fictitious-frequency 
problems. The available methods have been summarized from the viewpoint of the dual integral 
representation. From this viewpoint, the fictitious frequencies depend on the kernel of the integral 
representation of the solution and on the location where the singularity is distributed. In other words, the 
boundary condition can not change the position of fictitious frequencies once the integral representation is 
chosen. To demonstrate that these statements are true, Chen has given three examples for one-, two- and 
three-dimensional problems by using the indirect method and the direct method. In the three examples, the 
degenerate kernels in the frequency domain have been employed to represent the potentials in the interior 
and exterior domains. The analytical results can be obtained and the mechanism of fictitious frequencies 
can be easily understood upon considering the difference of the stiffness matrix between the exterior and 
interior problems. Therefore, some misleading comments by Shaw and Rizzo have been corrected. 
Besides, the mathematical structures of the four matrices, U, T, L and M can be unified by using the SVD. 
It is found that fictitious modes are imbedded in the left unitary vectors of the influence matrix after using 
the SVD while true modes are given in the right unitary vectors. 
 
2.6 Corner problem 
The corner problem with the Dirichlet boundary condition is another problem in which the number of 
equations is not sufficient for the conventional BEM. The double-node technique was utilized to tackle 
this problem. Researchers have tried to find better and additional constraints. Again, the hypersingular 
integral formulation plays a role in providing independent constraints for the boundary unknowns. For the 
case that the displacement (or potential) is specified at the corner, the traction (or potential flux) unknowns 
the above statement that the inversion of a matrix with diagonal dominance is numerically stable. Also, the 
properties of Caleron projector can be found. 
 
2.11 The Tikhonov formulation for inverse problems with overspecified boundary conditions 
In solving an ill-posed inverse problem with overspecified boundary conditions by the Tikhonov 
formulation, double boundary integrals occur naturally. The inner integrals in the double integrals are   
hypersingular. To avoid hypersingularity, Yeih, Koya and Mura employed a fictitious BEM to deal with 
the inverse problem. Fictitious BEM proposed by Yeih et al. is not absolutely necessary since the 
hypersingular integral can be evaluated by using the regularization techniques. 
 
2.12 Free-surface problems 
The free-surface  problem can be treated as a moving boundary problem with overspecified boundary 
conditions. An iterative scheme for the free-surface seepage was proposed by Niwa using the conventional 
BEM. By employing the hypersingular integral equation, the rate of convergence can be accelerated. The 
number of iteration using the hypersingular equation is lower than that using the singular formulation. 
 
2.13 Construction of the image system 
In the half-plane, half-space, quarter-plane or quarter space problems, special Green's functions subjected 
to certain boundary conditions are often used as auxiliary systems to establish integral equations which 
can eliminate integrations on the rectilinear or plane boundaries such as the ground surface. 
Conventionally, we always locate the source outside the domain to adjust for the satisfaction of  boundary 
conditions. Based on the physical meaning of the dual integral equations in potential theory, an additional 
degree of freedom for adjusting is available, which is the normal vector of the dipole  or dislocation source. 
Illustrative examples have been given in the book by Chen and Hong. 
 
3. RANK DEFICIENCY IN BEM/BIEM 
3.1  Degenerate boundary in boundary value problems 
For the problem with a degenerate boundary, the dual integral representation has been proposed for crack 
problems in elasticity by Hong and Chen, and boundary element researchers have increasingly paid 
attention to the second equation of the dual representation. The second equation, which is derived for the 
secondary field, e.g., flux or traction, is very popular now and is termed the hypersingular boundary 
integral equation. Hong and Chen presented the theoretical bases of the dual integral equations and a 
general formulation which incorporates the displacement and traction boundary integral equations. Huang 
and So extended the concept of he Hadamard principal value in the dual integral equations to determine the 
dynamic stress intensity factors of multiple cracks.  Gray also independently found the hypersingular 
integral representations for the Laplace equation and the Navier equation although he did not coin the 
formulation “dual”. Martin, Rizzo and Gonsalves called the new kernel in the dual integral equations  
“hypersingular” while Kaya  earlier called the kernel “superstrong singularity”. Since the formulation was 
derived for the secondary field, by analogy with the term “natural boundary condition”, Feng and Yu  
called the method ``natural BEM" or ``canonical integral equations''. Balas, Sladek and Sladek in their 
book proposed a unified theory for crack problems by using the displacement boundary integral equation 
and another integro-differential equation for the traction field. Based on the dual integral representation for 
the degenerate boundary problems, Hong and Chen developed the dual BEM programs for crack and 
potential flow problems with a cutoff wall. Besides, Chen and his coworkers extended the dual BEM 
program for the Laplace equation and the Navier equation to three programs. One is for the Helmholtz 
equation by the dual MRM. Another is for the Helmholtz equation by the complex-valued formulation.The 
other is for the modified Helmholtz equation. A general purpose program, BEASY, was developed for 
crack problems by the Wessex Institute of Technology (WIT) and termed the ``dual boundary element 
method (DBEM)" . This program has been extended to solve crack growth problems more efficiently by 
using  the benefit of the single-domain approach. Chen and Hong, Mi and Aliabadi  extended 
two-dimensional cases to three-dimensional crack problems. A program implemented by Lutz et al. was 
also reported. In the mathematical literature, the relationships between the boundary integral operators and 
various layer potentials are obtainable through the so-called Calderon projector. Four identities to relate 
harmonic equation and the biharmonic equation and the possible degenerate scales were investigated. 
Hypersingular formulation is an alternative to study the degenerate scale problems for simply-connected 
problems, since eigenvalues are never zero. Another simple approach is to superimpose a rigid body 
motion in the fundamental solution so that the zero eigenvalue can be shifted to be nonzero. However, this 
treatment results in another degenerate scale. By employing the CHIEF concept, a CHEEF approach was 
developed to obtain the independent constraint. A unified method was proposed to study the problem by 
using the Fredholm alternative theorem and the SVD updating technique. Both the spurious mode 
(mathematically realizable) and rigid body mode (physically realizable) can be determined. The left and 
right unitary matrices in the SVD for BEM are found to be the true and spurious modes. In addition, a 
direct treatment in the matrix operation instead of adding a rigid body term in the fundamental solution can 
be derived. The general proof of degenerate scale for eccentric Laplace problems was obtained to show the 
outer radius of one is the critical value.  
 
3.3 Spurious eigensolutions for interior eigenproblems 
For interior problems, eigendata are very important informations in vibrations and acoustics. According to 
the complex-valued boundary element method, the eigenvalues and eigenmodes can be determined. 
Nevertheless, complex arithmetic is required. To avoid complex arithmetic, many approaches including 
the multiple reciprocity method (MRM), the real-part and the imaginary-part BEMs have been proposed. 
For example, Tai and Shaw employed only real-part kernel in the integral formulation. A simplified 
method using only the real-part or imaginary-part kernel was also presented by De Mey, Yasko and 
Hutchinson. Although De Mey found that the zeros for a real-part of the complex determinant may be 
different from the determinant by using the real-part kernel, the spurious eigensolutions were not 
discovered analytically. Chen and Wong  and Yeih et al. found the spurious eigensolutions analytically in 
the MRM by using simple examples of rod and beam, respectively. Later, Kamiya et al. and Yeih  et al. 
independently claimed that MRM is no more than the real-part BEM. Kang et al. employed the 
Nondimensional Dynamic Influence Function method (NDIF) to solve the eigenproblem. Chen et al. 
commented that the NDIF method is a special case of imaginary-part BEM. Kang and Lee also found the 
spurious eigensolutions and filtered out the spurious eigenvalues by using the net approach. Later, they 
extended to solve plate vibration problems. Chen  et al. proposed a double-layer potential approach to filter 
out the spurious eigenmodes. The reason why spurious eigenvalues occur in the real-part BEM is the loss 
of the constraints, which was investigated by Yeih et al.. The spurious eigensolutions and fictitious

Maxwell equation. The spurious eigensolutions can be filtered out by using many alternatives, e.g., the 
complex-valued BEM, the domain partition technique, the dual formulation in conjunction with the SVD

the complex-valued kernel was used. A unified formulation to study the phenomenon was proposed by 
using the Fredholm alternative theorem and the SVD technique. The SVD updating techniques in 
conjunction with the dual formulation was employed to sort out the true and spurious eigenvalues. In 
addition, the relation between the left unitary vector in the SVD and the spurious mode was constructed by 
NTOU/MSV group. 
 
3.4 Fictitious frequency in exterior acoustics

the numerical treatment of integral equation formulation, which breaks down at certain frequency known 
as irregular frequency or fictitious frequency. This problem is completely nonphysical because there are

Abstract  In this paper, the two classical elasticity problems, Lamé problem and stress concentration 
factor, are revisited by using the null-field integral equation. The null-field integral formulation is utilized 
in conjunction with degenerate kernel and Fourier series. To fully utilize the circular geometry, the 
fundamental solutions and the boundary densities are expanded by using degenerate kernels and Fourier 
series, respectively. In the two classical problems of elasticity, the null-field BIE is employed to derive the 
exact solutions.The Kelvin solution is first separated to degenerate kernel in this paper. After employing 
the null-field BIE, not only the stress but also the displacement field are obtained. In a similar way, Lamé 
problem is solved without any difficulty. 
 
Key words:  elasticity, degenerate kernel, Fourier series, null-field integral equation, SCF, Lamé problem 
 
1. INTRODUCTION  
 
Engineering problems always are simulated by using the mathematical models of boundary value 
problem, e.g., the steady state heat conduction problem [1], electrostatic potential [2] and torsion bar 
problems [3] are simulated by the Laplace equation; membrane vibration [4], acoustics [5] and water wave 
problems [6] are governed by the Helmholtz equation; plate vibration [7] and Stokes’ flow [8] are 
formulated by the biharmonic equation. In order to solve the boundary value problems, researchers and 
engineers have paid more attention on the development of boundary integral equation method (BIEM), 
boundary element method (BEM) and meshless method than domain type methods, finite element method 
(FEM) and finite difference method (FDM). Among various numerical methods, BEM is one of the most 
popular numerical approaches for solving boundary value problems. Although BEM has been involved as 
an alternative numerical method for solving engineering problems, some critical issues exist, e.g. singular 
and hypersingular integrals, boundary-layer effect, ill-posed system and mesh generation. 
Unlike the conventional BEM and BIEM, Waterman [9] introduced first the so-called T-matrix 
method for electromagnetic scattering problems. Various names, null-field approach or extended 
boundary condition method (EBCM), have been coined. The null-field approach or T-matrix method was 
used widely for obtaining numerical solutions of acoustics [10], elastodynamics [11] and hydrodynamics 
[12]. Boström [13] introduced a new method of treating the scattering of transient fields by a bounded 
obstacle in the three-dimensional space. He defined new sets of time-dependent basis functions, and use of 
these to expand the free space Green’s function and the incoming and scattered fields. The method is a 
generalization to the time domain of the null-field approach first given by Waterman [9]. A crucial 
advantage of the null-field approach or T-matrix method consists in the fact that the influence matrix can 
be computed easily. Although many works for acoustic, elastodynamic and hydrodynamic problems have 
been done, only a few articles on elastostatics can be found [14]. The idea of changing the singularity 
distribution from real boundary to fictitious boundary (fictitious BEM) or putting the observation point 
outside the domain (null-field approach) can remove the singular and hypersingular integrals. However, 
they may result in an ill-posed matrix. 
In the Fredholm integral equations, the degenerate kernel (or so-called separate kernel) plays an 
important role. However, its applications in practical problems seem to have taken a back seat to other 
 3
The direct formulation of boundary integral equation method stems from the reciprocal work 
theorem. We have the Somigliana’s identity [22], 
( ) ( , ) ( ) ( ) ( , ) ( ) ( ),j ij i ij iB Bu s U x s t x dB x T x s u x dB x s D= − ∈∫ ∫ , (2)
0 ( , ) ( ) ( ) ( , ) ( ) ( ), cij i ij iB BU x s t x dB x T x s u x dB x s D= − ∈∫ ∫ , (3)
where ( , )ijU x s  and ( , )ijT x s  are the Kelvin free-space Green’s function of the ith direction respons for 
displacement and traction, respectively, due to a concentrated load in the jth direction at the point s , and 
cD  denotes the complementary domain. Equations (2) and (3) can be changed to 
( ) ( , ) ( ) ( ) ( , ) ( ) ( ),i k i k k i kB Bu x U s x t s dB s T s x u s dB s x D= − ∈∫ ∫ , (4)
0 ( , ) ( ) ( ) ( , ) ( ) ( ), ck i k k i kB BU s x t s dB s T s x u s dB s x D= − ∈∫ ∫ . (5)
The explicit form of ( , )k iU s x , or so-called Kelvin solution, is

where ν  is the Poisson ratio, i i iy s x= −  and 1,2i =  and 1,2k =  for the plane elasticity. Now, in order to 
obtain an additional independent equation, we apply the traction operator [23] to Eqs.(4) and (5).Then, we 
have 
( ) ( , ) ( ) ( ) ( , ) ( ) ( ),p kp k kp kB Bt x L s x t s dB s M s x u s dB s x D= − ∈∫ ∫ , (7)
0 ( , ) ( ) ( ) ( , ) ( ) ( ), ckp k kp kB BL s x t s dB s M s x u s dB s x D= − ∈∫ ∫ . (8)
Equations (4) and (7) are coined the dual boundary integral equations for the domain point and Eqs.(5) and 
(8) are called the dual null-field integral equations. When  the field point x  is collocated on the real 
boundary, the dual boundary integral equations for the boundary point ( x B∈ ) can be obtained as follows: 
( ) . . . ( , ) ( ) ( ) . . . ( , ) ( ) ( ) ,ij j k i k k i kB Bc u x R PV U s x t s dB s C PV T s x u s dB s x B= − ∈∫ ∫ , (9)
where R.P.V. is the Riemann principal value, C.P.V. is the Cauchy principal value, and ijc  is equal to 
ij ijδ −B  in which ijB  depends on the solid angle and on the configuration of the corner at x  of the 
boundary and on the Poisson ratio of the material of the body. At a smooth boundary, ijB  reduces to 2ijδ . 
By applying the traction operator to Eq.(9), we have 
( ) . . . ( , ) ( ) ( ) . . . ( , ) ( ) ( ),pj j kp k kp kB Bc t x C PV L s x t s dB s H PV M s x u s dB s x B= − ∈∫ ∫ , (10)
where H.P.V. denotes the Hadamard principal value. A detailed discussion for the dual boundary integral 
equations can be found in the original article by Hong and Chen [23] and a review article of Chen and 
Hong [24]. It is noted that the conventional null-field integral equations are not singular since s  and x  
never coincide. If the kernel functions in Eqs. (4), (5), (7) and (8) are substituted by using the appropriate 
degenerate (separable) kernels, we have 
( ) ( , ) ( ) ( ) ( , ) ( ) ( ),i k i k k i kB Bu x U s x t s dB s T s x u s dB s x D B= − ∈ ∪∫ ∫ , (11)
( ) ( , ) ( ) ( ) ( , ) ( ) ( ),p kp k kp kB Bt x L s x t s dB s M s x u s dB s x D B= − ∈ ∪∫ ∫ , (12)
0 ( , ) ( ) ( ) ( , ) ( ) ( ), ck i k k i kB BU s x t s dB s T s x u s dB s x D B= − ∈ ∪∫ ∫ , (13)
0 ( , ) ( ) ( ) ( , ) ( ) ( ), ckp k kp kB BL s x t s dB s M s x u s dB s x D B= − ∪ ∪∫ ∫ . (14)
It is found that the integral equations for the domain point or for the null-field point can include the 
collocation point on the real boundary since the appropriate degenerate kernels are used as elaborated on 
later.

and the three kernels ( ( , )k iT s x , ( , )k iL s x  and ( , )k iM s x ) can be obtained according to their definitions by

not found in the literature before.

For another part solution in Figure 3(a), it is simulated by using a circular plate with the radius b . When 
the radius b  approaches infinity, it is seen as an infinite plate. Based on this concept, we obtain the Fourier

After determining the Fouries coefficients of boundary densities, the deformation fields are obtained by 
substituting the coefficients in Eq.(35) into Eq.(11).The coefficients, 0,1a

The hoop stress distribution in Eq.(45) is the same as that of  Timoshenko and Goodier’s book [25]. When 
2φ π=  or 3 2φ π= , the hoop stress ( θθσ ) reaches the maximum of 3S . However, it is not found for the 
displacement fields in the Timoshenko and Goodier’s book [25]. Only Airy stress function and stress were 
obtained in their book. If we would like to know the displacement fields, it is necessary to calculate the 
strain through the Hooke’s law. Then, the displacement fields can be determined from stress by integrating 
the strain. This procedure may be not straightforward and is time-consuming. In the proposed approach,

These stress distributions are the same as Timoshenko and Goodier’s solution [25]. As mentioned 
similarly in the Eample 1, only Airy stress function is found in their book. For the proposed approach, the 
displacement fields and stress can be obtained at the same time. The inner and outer radii are given 1 and 5, 
respectively. The uniform pressures are set as 1eP =  and 2iP = . The sketch of the deformation is shown in 
Fig. 5. Also, another alternative of the LM hypersingular formulation of Eq.(14) can be utilized to obtain 
the same result in the proposed approach.

4. Concluding remarks 
For the elasticity problems with circular boundaries, we have proposed an analytical method by using 
the null-field integral formulation in conjunction with degenerate kernels and Fourier series. The 
advantages, free of calculating principal value, meshless and well-posed system were addressed. Besides, 
displacement as well as stress responses were both obtained at the same time. For the circular and annular 
cases, the analytical solutions were obtained by using the present method. Two illustrative examples, the 
stress concentration factor problem and the Lamé problem were demonstrated to see the validity of the 
analytical formulation. Good agreements were made after comparing the results with those of Timoshenko 
and Goodier’s textbook.
