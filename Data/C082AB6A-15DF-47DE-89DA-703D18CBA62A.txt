1. Introduction 
     The good fluid management at the membrane surface plays an important role in 
successful application of ultrafiltration. In almost all cross-flow ultrafiltration the 
permeate flux declines along the flow direction because of the concentration 
polarization and progressive fouling by the rejected particles [1,2]. Many hydraulic 
approaches, such as increasing fluid velocity or creating turbulent behavior, 
developed for reducing the concentration polarization resistance and progressive 
fouling to enhance the ultrafiltration flux, have been thoroughly discussed [3-14]. 
Actually, raising fluid velocity or creating turbulent behavior in the cross-flow 
membrane modules has two conflicting effects on ultrafiltration: They are the 
desirable effect of decrease in concentration polarization resistance and the 
undesirable effect of increase in frictional pressure loss. Since, along the flow channel 
in an ultrafilter, transmembrane pressure decreases while concentration polarization 
resistance increases. It appears therefore that gradually increasing the turbulent 
strength along the flow channel might suitably suppress the increasing resistance to 
permeation due to concentration polarization while properly maintaining the 
decreasing tranemembrane pressure. It is the purpose of present study to investigate 
the effect of varying baffled-ring distance on ultrafiltration and to derive the 
prediction equation for estimating the permeate flux, in a tubular membrane of a 
ring-rod insert with decreasing buffled-ring distance. 
2. Analysis 
     Consider a tubular-membrane module of length L and radius rm inserted 
concentrically with a solid rod of radius krm, wrapped with (N-1) baffled-ring of 
gradually decreasing ring distances dj along the solid rod with arithemetic series of 
constant difference a, as shown in Fig.1. Thus

2.1. Mass balance 
     Let Q(z) be the volumetric flow rate of solution in a ring-rod membrane tube 
and J(z) be the permeate flux by ultrafiltration. Then a mass balance over a slice dz of 
the flow channel gives

Since the permeation rate of membrane ultrafiltration is much smaller than the volume 
flow rate, J in Eq.(2) may be taken as its average value, i.e.

The integration of Eq.(14) was readily obtained but will not be presented here due to 
the long and cumbersome expression. 
3.  Experimental 
3.1. Experimental value of J  
     The experimental apparatus, materials and procedure were exactly the same as 
those in previous work [16], except that the wire spiral wrapped on the solid rod was 
replaced by 9 ring baffles, having ring-wire diameter of 1mm, as shown in Figs.1 and 
2. The membrane medium used in the ring-rod module was mainly a 150 kDa MWCO 
tubular ceramic membrane (M2 type, Techsep, France; length L=0.4 m, i.d. 2rm=6mm) 
inserted concentrically with a baffled-ring rod of radius krm (k=1/2). The distance 
between two rings dj at jth section decreases along the steel rod by arithemetic series 
with constant difference a, as

4.  Results and discussion 
4.1. Comparison of correlation predictions with experimental results 
     The average values of permeate flux J  were calculated from Eq.(14) by 
iteration method coupled with the use of the correlation equations, Eqs.(20), (21) and 
(25), and some of the predicted values are compared with the experimental data, as 
shown in Figs.3-6. It is seen in these figures that the correlation predictions are rather 
acceptable for higher feed concentration, while comparing with the experimental 
results. The average permeate flux increases with the inlet volumetric flow rate Qi and 
transmembrane pressure iPD , but decreases when the inlet concentration Ci increases. 
4.2. Effect of a on PDf  
     Since the thickness of concentration-polarization layer is small at the inlet and 
then increases along the flow channel, larger ring distance for less increment in 
turbulent behavior around the inlet region of a ring-baffle device is sufficiently 
enough to reduce the lower concentration-polarization resistance. In the meantime, 
smaller ring distance, as well as stronger turbulent behavior, around the outlet region 
is required for suppressing the higher concentration-polarization resistance. In present 
study, therefore, we are concerning with the device of gradually increasing the 
turbulent behavior along the flow channel by gradually decreasing the ring-baffle 
distance along the arithematic series of constant difference a, and with constant 
number N of total rings. Consequently, the concentration polarization resistance, 
PDf , decreases when the ring-baffle distance decreases more rapidly, especially for 
higher feed concentration, as shown in Table 1. 
4.3. Effect of a on J  
     The increase in turbulent strength by gradually decreasing the baffle-ring 
distance actually has two conflict effects on permeate flux. One, the decreases in 
resistance to permeation due to reduction in concentration polarization, is good for 
ultrafiltration, while the other, the increases in pressure drop, as well as the decreases 
in transmembrane pressure, due to increases in friction loss, is bad for ultrafiltration. 
It appears, therefore, that proper adjustment of turbulent strength along the flow 
channel as well as proper arrangement of the baffle-ring distance with a specified 
operating conditions (Ci, Qi and ΔPi), might effectively suppress any undesirable

number of rings were fixed at nine (i.e. N=10) and their distances decreased gradually 
along the module, as indicated by Eqs.(16) and (18). The comparison of the 
correlation predictions with experimental results are rather acceptable for higher feed 
concentration. Ultrafiltration in the module without ring rod (k=0) was also carried 
out and with the results, the improvement in performance by inserting the ring rod 
was proved. This is because that by applying the ring-rod device, the desirable effect 
of reducing the concentration polarization resistance can compensate for the 
undesirable effect of decrease in transmembrane pressure. The improvement (I) 
increases when the decrease in ring distance is rather rapid, as well as the value of a 
(the constant difference of an arithemetic series) increases, especially for higher feed 
concentration.
