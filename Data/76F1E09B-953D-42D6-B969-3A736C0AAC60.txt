fashion to improve the signal extraction performance. The proposed TSEA not only outperforms the 
FKMA, but also shares the convergence and computation advantages enjoyed by the latter. This paper also 
considers the extraction of multiple sources, also known as source separation, by incorporating the 
proposed TSEA into the widely used multistage successive cancellation (MSC) procedure. A problem with 
the MSC procedure is its susceptibility to error propagation accumulated at each stage. We propose two 
noncancellation multistage (NCMS) algorithms, referred to as NCMSFKMA and NCMS-TSEA, that are 
free from the error propagation effects. Simulation results are presented to show that the NCMSTSEA 
yields substantial performance gain compared with some existing blind separation algorithms, together with 
a computational complexity comparison. Finally, we draw some conclusions.

Cellular and molecular imaging promises powerful tools for the visualization and elucidation of important 
disease-causing biological processes. Recent research aims to simultaneously assess the 
spatial-spectral/temporal distributions of multiple biomarkers, where the signals often represent a 
composite of more than one distinct source independent of spatial resolution. We report here a blind source 
separation method for quantitative dissection of mixed yet correlated biomarker patterns. The 
computational solution is based on a latent variable model, whose parameters are estimated using the 
nonnegative least-correlated component analysis (nLCA) proposed in this paper. We demonstrate the 
efficacy of the nLCA on real bio-imaging data sets. With accurate and robust performance, it has powerful 
features which are of considerable widespread applicability.

Most independent component analysis methods for blind source separation rely on the fundamental 
assumption that all the unknown sources are mutually statistically independent. Such assumption becomes 
problematic when applied to many real world applications (e.g., biomedical imaging) that subsequently 
motivated the exploitation of non-negative nature of the sources, observations and mixing matrix. We 
recently proposed a new method, called the non-negative least-correlated component analysis (nLCA) for a 
noise-free 2×2 mixing system, that relaxes the source independence assumption while uses the 
non-negativity constraints on the sources, observations and mixing matrix. In this paper, we extend the 
nLCA to the case of a noisy M×N non-negative mixing system where M ≥ N ≥ 2. The nLCA involves only 
low-complexity algebraic computations, and thus is computationally efficient. Illustrative experimental 
results are presented to demonstrate its efficacy together with a performance comparison with some 
existing algorithms.

In this paper, we apply convex analysis to the problem of blind source separation (BSS) of non-negative 
signals. Under realistic assumptions applicable to many real-world problems such as multichannel 
biomedical imaging, we formulate a new BSS criterion that does not require statistical source independence, 
a fundamental assumption to many existing BSS approaches. The new criterion guarantees perfect 
separation (in the absence of noise), by constructing a convex set from the observations and then finding 
the extreme points of the convex set. Some experimental results are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of 
the proposed method.

ABSTRACT
In this paper, we apply convex analysis to the problem of blind
source separation (BSS) of non-negative signals. Under realistic
assumptions applicable to many real-world problems such as mul-
tichannel biomedical imaging, we formulate a new BSS criterion
that does not require statistical source independence, a fundamen-
tal assumption to many existing BSS approaches. The new criterion
guarantees perfect separation (in the absence of noise), by construct-
ing a convex set from the observations and then ¿nding the extreme
points of the convex set. Some experimental results are provided to
demonstrate the ef¿cacy of the proposed method.

1. INTRODUCTION
The problem of independent component analysis (ICA) or blind
source separation (BSS) has received wide attention in various ¿elds
such as biomedical signal analysis, speech enhancement, wireless
communications and image processing [1] [2]. Most existing ICA
or BSS algorithms were developed under certain assumptions on the
sources; e.g., that the sources are statistically independent and non-
Gaussian. For instance, the fast ¿xed-point algorithm (also called the
FastICA) [1] is based on the assumption that the sources are mutually
independent with non-zero kurtosis (a fourth-order cumulant). The
non-negative ICA (nICA) [3] is based on the assumption that sources
are non-negative and mutually uncorrelated. However, this funda-
mental assumption, source independence, becomes problematic in
many real world applications, such as biomedical imaging [4] and
hyperspectral imaging [5] where sources can be correlated. Thus,
many researchers exploit the non-negativity of both the sources and
mixing matrix to develop their BSS algorithms. The non-negative
matrix factorization (NMF) [6] can be used to decompose the obser-
vation matrix as a product of two non-negative matrices (represent-
ing the source matrix and mixing matrix). However, the solutions
to the NMF may be non-unique. Moreover, a method proposed by
Wang et al. [7] [8], called the non-negative least-correlated compo-
nent analysis (nLCA), extracts original (independent or correlated)
sources by minimizing the correlation coef¿cient between two esti-
mated sources.
This paper presents a convex analysis approach to BSS of non-
negative sources that are allowed to be dependent. The main contri-
bution is formulation of a new BSS criterion, which can guarantee

perfect separation in the absence of noise under several mild assump-
tions that usually hold in biomedical imaging applications. A BSS
method based on the new criterion will also be discussed.
2. SYSTEMMODEL
Consider anM ×N mixing system with inputs and outputs denoted
by s[n] = [ s1[n], . . . , sN [n] ]T and x[n] = [ x1[n], . . . , xM [n] ]T
respectively. Assume that the noise is absent. Then the mixing signal
model is given by
x[n] = As[n], n = 1, . . . , L (1)
where A is the mixing matrix which is unknown, and L is the data
length and L  max{M,N}. Our BSS approach to be presented
is based on the following assumptions which are motivated by mag-
netic resonance imaging (MRI) applications:
(A1) (Non-negative source signals) For all n, s[n] ∈ RN+ where
R+ is the set of non-negative real numbers.
(A2) For each source index i ∈ {1, . . . , N}, there exists a time
index i such that si[i] > 0 and sj [i] = 0, ∀j = i.
(A3) (Unit row sum) For all i = 1, . . . ,M ,
N
 
j=1
aij = 1 (2)
where aij denotes the (i, j) entry ofA.
(A4) M ≥ N andA is of full column rank.
(A5) (Non-negative mixing matrix)A ∈ RM×N+ .
(A1) and (A5) are generally true in biomedical imaging [3]
where image intensities and the mixing process are represented by
non-negative numbers. (A2) usually holds for sparse signals such as
brain MRI in biomedical imaging, where the non-overlapping region
of the spatial distribution of a fast perfusion and a slow perfusion
source images [4] can be higher than 95%, thereby making (A2) an
advisable assumption. (A3) can be achieved by a straightforward
preprocessing [8], and it is automatically satis¿ed in MRI due to the
partial volume effect [8]. (A4) is an assumption widely made in the
BSS problem.
For notational convenience, we will focus on the following al-
ternate signal model. Let si = [ si[1], . . . , si[L] ]T and xi =
[ xi[1], . . . , xi[L] ]
T . The model in (1) can be rewritten as

3.3. Signal Convex Hull, Extreme Points, and Perfect Blind Sep-
aration
Recall that we are dealing with non-negative source signals. Hence,
si ∈ aﬀ{s1, . . . , sN} ∩ R
L
+  S (15)
for any i. Now, we can show that
Lemma 2. Suppose that (A1) and (A2) hold. Then,
S = conv{s1, . . . , sN} (16)
and the set of all its extreme points is {s1, . . . , sN}.
The proof of Lemma 2 is given in Section 7. Lemma 2 gives the
important implication that perfect blind separation can be done by
identifying the extreme points of the signal convex set S .
Given the observations, we only know from (10) and (15) that S
is of the form
S =   x = Cα + d


α ∈ RN−1  ∩ RL+
=   x = Cα + d


Cα + d 
 0, α ∈ RN−1  (17)
for some C and d estimated from the observations (see Proposition
1), and 
 is the elementwise inequality. Let F be the image of S
under the mapping from x to α, i.e.,
F =   α ∈ RN−1



c
T
nα + dn ≥ 0, n = 1, . . . , L
 (18)
where cTn is the nth row ofC. We prove the correspondence between
the extreme points of S and F in the following lemma:
Lemma 3. The set F given by (18) is equivalent to
F = conv{α1, . . . ,αN} (19)
where each αi ∈ RN−1 is such that Cαi + d = si. It has N
extreme points, given by α1, . . . ,αN .
The proof of Lemma 3 is given in Section 7. More importantly, in
convex analysis there is a powerful result that can help us identify
the extreme points of F :
Lemma 4. (Extreme point validation for polyhedra [10]) A
point α ∈ F is an extreme point of F if and only if the following
collection of vectors
Cα = { cn ∈ R
N−1 | cTnα = −dn, n = 1, . . . , L } (20)
contains N − 1 linearly independent vectors.
Summarizing the results developed above, we have the follow-
ing new blind separation criterion for non-negative sources:
Theorem 1. (New BSS criterion) Suppose that (A1) to (A4) hold.
The set
F =   α ∈ RN−1

the af¿ne set ¿tting solution in Proposition 1, has N extreme points
α1, . . . ,αN . Each extreme point corresponds to a source signal
through Cαi + d = si. The extreme points of F can be identi¿ed
by using the validation procedure in Lemma 4.
4. BSS METHOD BASED ON THE NEW CRITERION
Based on the BSS criterion in Theorem 1, a BSS method which
works by identifying the extreme points of F is proposed in this sec-
tion. Let us focus on the case of N = 2 and the case of N = 3, re-
spectively. By (A1) to (A5), one can see that d =  M
i=1 xi/M 
 0.
Case A:N = 2. It can be shown that there is a closed form solution
α1 = min
n
{−dn/cn | cn < 0, n = 1, 2, ..., L},
α2 = max
n
{−dn/cn | cn > 0, n = 1, 2, ..., L}.
Case B: N = 3. In Fig. 2, we can see that there are three faces
forming the boundary of F , and that identifying any 2 faces will be
suf¿cient to determine one extreme point. An extreme point search
algorithm is then as follows.
Step 1. Given an arbitrary vector r1 ∈ R2 and setting r2 = −r1,
¿nd the indices associated with two of the faces by

ABSTRACT
This paper presents a semiblind maximum-likelihood (ML) detector
for the orthogonal space-time block coded orthogonal frequency di-
vision multiplexing (OSTBC-OFDM) system. Many existing blind/
semiblind OSTBC-OFDM receivers typically require that the chan-
nel is static over a multitude of OSTBC-OFDM blocks. The pro-
posed method is speciﬁcally for detection over one OSTBC-OFDM
block only, and hence is well suited to block fading channels. The
presented identiﬁability analysis shows that the data can be uniquely
identiﬁed in a probability one sense by using one pilot code only,
in contrast to the pilot-based least-squares channel estimator which
requires at leastL pilot codes whereL is the channel length. Simula-
tion examples are then presented to show the efﬁcacy of the proposed
detector.

1. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, the space-time block coded orthogonal frequency di-
vision multiplexing (STBC-OFDM) system has drawn a lot of atten-
tions because it provides a straightforward way of extending STBC
techniques to frequency selective fading channels [1–7]. In par-
ticular, the STBC-OFDM system based on the orthogonal STBCs
(OSTBCs) [9] maximizes the transmit diversity and has a simple
Maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder given channel state information
(CSI) at the receiver. To estimate CSI with high spectral efﬁciency, it
has been a great interest to develop blind/semiblind channel estima-
tion methods for OSTBC-OFDM systems [1–4]. However, most of
the existing methods are based on the second-order statistics (SOSs)
of the received signal, which usually require the channel to remain
static over many OSTBC-OFDM blocks. When the channel is static
only for two OSTBC-OFDM blocks, a particularly convenient blind
scheme is the differentially encoded OSTBC-OFDM system [6]. It,
however, incurs a 3 dB performance loss in signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR).
In the paper, the channel is assumed to be block fading, i.e., the
channel coefﬁcients do not vary for one OSTBC-OFDM block in-
terval but can change from block to block. By using a time-domain
channel parameterization, we apply the deterministic ML criterion
[10, 11] to jointly detect the data and estimate the channel with one
OSTBC-OFDM signal block only. An important result shown here
is that the data can be uniquely identiﬁed with probability one when
there is only one pilot code transmitted. This results in a semiblind
ML OSTBC-OFDM detector that uses fewer pilot codes than the

conventional pilot-aided channel estimator [8]. Regarding the real-
ization problem, it is further shown that the proposed detector can
be recast as a Boolean quadratic program (BQP), which can be han-
dled effectively by various means. Simulation results in Sec. 4 fur-
ther demonstrate that the proposed detector can yield very promising
performance.
2. OSTBC-OFDM SIGNAL MODEL
Consider an OSTBC-OFDM system [5, 7] equipped with Nt trans-
mit antennas and Nr receive antennas. Let Nc denote the discrete
Fourier transform (DFT) size and T be the code length. Assuming
that the channel coefﬁcients are static for T OFDM blocks, the re-
ceived code matrix in subchannel n is given by [5]
Yn = C(sn)Hn + Wn, (1)
where n = 1, ..., Nc, and
Yn ∈ CT×Nr received code matrix for subchannel n;
sn ∈ {±1}K transmitted data vector for subchannel n where K
is the number of bits per code;
C(·) ∈ CT×Nt transmitted OSTBC (T ≥ Nt);
Hn ∈ CNt×Nr multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channel
frequency response matrix for subchannel n;
Wn ∈ CT×Nr AWGN matrix for subchannel n where the aver-
age power per entry is σ2w.
In general, the OSTBCs can be represented by a linear disper-
sion form. Speciﬁcally, for BPSK/QPSK OSTBCs, they can be ex-
pressed as [9]
C(sn) =
K
 
k=1
Xksn,k, (2)
where sn,k ∈ {±1} is the kth entry of sn, andXk ∈ CT×Nt are the
basis matrices. The basis matrices are specially designed such that
for any sn ∈ {±1}K ,
CH(sn)C(sn) = KINt , (3)
where INt is the Nt ×Nt identity matrix.
Because the time-domain channel coefﬁcients can usually be
modeled by a ﬁnite impulse response (FIR) whose length can be
much less than Nc, we can parameterize Hn using the FIR chan-
nel coefﬁcients. Let hm,j ∈ CL be a column vector containing the
time-domain channel coefﬁcients between the mth transmit antenna
and the jth receive antenna, where L is the channel length. Deﬁne

of F, we can show that a single pilot code is sufﬁcient to achieve
C1). Consider the following lemma.
Lemma 2: Let s, s′ ∈ {±1}NcK . There exists a matrix U ∈
C
LNt×LNt such that
C(s′)U = C(s) (19)
if and only if there exists a matrix Q ∈ CNt×Nt such that
C(s′n)Q = C(sn), (20)
for all n = 1, ..., Nc.
Due to space limit, the proof of Lemma 2 (which will be reported
in [13]) is omitted here. However, a special case of Lemma 2 where
Nt = 1 and T = 1 (uncoded SIMO OFDM system) has been im-
plicitly proved in [14]. Consider the case of M = 1, i.e., sp = s1 =
s′1. If (20) holds, we obtain Q = INt and subsequently, s
′
n = sn
for n = 2, ..., Nc, i.e., s′d = sd. Hence, by Lemma 2, (19) holds
only if s′d = sd, which means that C1) is achieved. Therefore, the
data identiﬁability can be guaranteed by merely transmitting one pi-
lot code. We can now formally summarize the above analysis as
follows:
Theorem 1: Assume that A1) holds and that there is no noise. If
any one of the subchannels carriers a pilot code, then the data sd
can be uniquely identiﬁed with probability one.
3.2. Realization of ML Detector
In this subsection, we show how the proposed detector can be real-
ized. For simplicity, we consider M = 1 which is the focus of this
paper (generalization to M > 1 is straightforward). Recall from
(11) that the semiblind ML detector for M = 1 is given by
{sˆd, Hˆ} = arg min
sd ∈ {±1}(Nc−1)K
H ∈ CLNt×Nr
||Y − C(s)H||2F , (21)
By using the same reformulation as in [12], one can turn (21) to the
following BQP

n . Therefore, the semiblind ML detector can be imple-
mented by solving this BQP. In recent years, there have been several
efﬁcient methods proposed for handling the BQP [12]; for example,
the sphere decoder, the norm relaxation method and the semideﬁnite
relaxation (SDR) algorithm [12]. To understand how these methods
can be applied, please refer to [12].
Although the aforementioned methods can be used to imple-
ment the ML detector, the complexity can still be an issue when the
DFT size Nc is very large. To tackle this problem, the subchannel
grouping method in [14] can be used. The application of subchan-
nel grouping to the problem here is straightforward, and is currently
being investigated.
4. SIMULATION RESULTS
This section presents two simulation examples to justify the efﬁcacy
of the proposed semiblind ML detector. The coefﬁcients of H are
zero-mean i.i.d. complex Gaussian distributed, and change from one
OSTBC-OFDM block to another. The SNR per subchannel is de-
ﬁned as
SNR = K
E{‖H‖2F }
TNcσ2w
.
The DFT size was 32 (Nc = 32) and the number of receive antennas
was two (Nr = 2). The signal constellation was QPSK. For the
proposed detector, the pilot code was placed at subchannel 1, and the
associated BQP in (22) was handled by the SDR algorithm [12]. The
detector performance was measured in terms of the average bit error
rate (BER). We compared the proposed detector to the coherent ML
detector (with perfect CSI) and the pilot-based LS channel estimator
mentioned in Sec. 3.1. For the LS channel estimator, L pilot codes
were used. Let S be the subset of subchannel indices where the pilot
codes for LS method are placed. In the simulation, it was set to be
S = 
1, 1 + Nc
L
, 1 + Nc
L
· 2, . . . , 1 + Nc
L
· (L− 1) . (26)
It can be shown [10,15] that, for ﬁxed L pilot codes, the pilot place-
ment in (26) leads to the minimummean-squared channel estimation
error. The differential OSTBC-OFDM scheme [6] was also consid-
ered for comparison, which was obtained by applying the differential
OSTBC scheme [16] to each subchannel. There were 15, 000 trials
performed in our simulation examples.
Figure 1 presents the results when the complex Alamouti code
(T = 2, Nt = 2) was used and L = 4. One can see, from this
ﬁgure, that the proposed detector outperforms both the pilot-based
LS method and the differential scheme. Moreover, the performance
difference between the proposed detector and the coherent ML de-
tector at BER= 10−4 is around 1 dB only. Similar results can also
be observed in Fig. 2 where the complex 4× 3 OSTBC (Eqn. (120)
of [17]) (T = 4, Nt = 3) was used and L = 8.
5. CONCLUSIONS
In the paper, we have proposed a semiblindML detector for OSTBC-
OFDM in block fading channels. The proposed detector, using the
FIR channel parameterization, can perform data detection in one
OSTBC-OFDM signal block. Our analysis shows that data iden-
tiﬁability with probability one is guaranteed as long as one pilot
code is used. It is also shown that the proposed detector can be efﬁ-
ciently realized by solving a BQP. The presented simulation results
further reveal that the proposed detector outperforms the pilot-based
LS method and the differential method.
