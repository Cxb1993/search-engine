英文摘要 
Single-layer FePt, bilayer (Mo/FePt or FePt/Mo), and trilayer Mo/FePt/Mo samples were 
prepared by rf magnetron sputtering. Each layer of FePt and Mo in the studied samples is 20 nm 
in thickness. Samples were deposited onto corning 1737 glass substrate at room temperature, then 
annealed at 350oC and 400oC for a period 10-120 minutes. Coercivities of the bilayer or tri-layer 
samples were higher than those of single-layer FePt. X-ray diffraction data also indicate higher 
degree of ordering for Mo-layer introduced samples. We suggest that the incoherent FePt/Mo 
interface may induce extra nucleation sites for ordering transformation, thus lowers the threshold 
of ordering temperature. 
High-coercivity Au(60 nm)/FePt(δ nm)/Au(60 nm) trilayer samples were prepared by 
sputtering at room temperature, followed by post annealing at different temperatures. For the 
sample with δ = 60 nm, L10 ordering transformation occurs at 500 oC. Coercivity (Hc) is 
increased with the annealing temperature in the studied range 400 – 800 oC. The Hc value of the 
trilayer films is also varied with thickness of FePt intermediate layer (δ), from 27 kOe for δ =ٛ 60 
nm to a maximum value of 33.5 kOe for δ = 20 nm. X-ray diffraction data indicate that the 
diffusion of Au atoms into the FePt L10 lattice is negligible even after a high-temperature (800 oC) 
annealing process. Furthermore, ordering parameter is almost unchanged as δ is reduced from 60 
to 15 nm. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) photos indicate that small FePt Ll0 particles 
are dispersed amid the large-grained Au. We believe that the high coercivity of the trilayer 
sample is attributed to the small and uniform grain sizes of the highly ordered FePt particles 
which have perfect phase separation with Au matrix.

The X-ray diffraction patterns of the single FePt, bilayer FePt/Mo and trilayer Mo/FePt/Mo 
films annealed at 350oC for 1 h are illustrated in Fig. 1. Only fundamental peaks appear in the 
pattern of single-layer FePt, indicating that the film has disordered structure. For bilayer and 
trilayer films, both fundamental and superlattice peaks are visible, thus demonstrating ordered 
structure. The extent of chemical ordering was further obtained from lattice parameter ratio c/a 
[11], by [4] S2 = [1-(c/a)]/[1-(c/a)f], where (c/a)f is 0.956 for the fully ordered FePt films [5]. For 
the FePt/Mo film, S is measured to be 0.64±0.02; for the trilayer film, it increases to 0.72±0.04. 
The in-plane magnetic hysteresis loops for the single-layer FePt, bilayer FePt/Mo and trilayer 
Mo/FePt/Mo films are shown in Fig. 2. Single-layer FePt sample exhibits a low Hc of about 200 
Oe and high remanence of 862 emu/cm3. High coercivities of 4.7 and 7.0 kOe and relatively low 
remanence of 713 and 661 emu/cm3 were obtained for the FePt/Mo and Mo/FePt/Mo films, 
respectively. Step-wise de-magnetize curves were also found in the Mo-inserted films which will 
be further discussed. 
From the above results, we suggest that the FePt/Mo interface effectively enhances the 
ordering transformation. This can be attributed to the negligible interdiffusion and the increasing 
nucleation sites for ordering transformation. Typically, impurities diffuse into FePt grains could 
usually retard ordering transformation. However, we found that Mo atoms are insoluble to FePt 
lattice even at very high temperature of 800°C [12]. Therefore, the composition of the 
Mo-introducing films can remain unchanged during the one-hour annealing at 350°C. This can be 
considered as one reason for the ordering enhancement. Secondly, the occurrence of the chemical 
ordering in a sequential low temperature ordering process is dominated by the nucleation of the 
order phase as reported by Takahashi et al. [13,14]. Due to the ordering gradient, thin films with 
this ordering mechanism show two-shoulder hysteresis loops. The presented Mo-inserted films 
exhibit similar feature. As the area of the FePt/Mo interface was increased, e. g. the trilayer case, 
the shoulder in the demagnetizing curve become smaller, and chemical ordering and Hc were 
enhanced. We therefore suggest that the FePt/Mo interface may induces extra nucleation sites 
which results in the lower threshold of ordering transformation.

Ordering Enhancement of FePt Thin Films by Introducing Mo layers 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 
To further develop magnetic storage density over than 1 Tbits/inch2, the magnetic grain must 
be reduced to very small size, which results in superparamagnetism problem. In order to improve 
thermal stability, high-magnetocrystalline-anisotropy magnetic materials become more attractive. 
The ordered L10 FePt films have received much attention due to its very high magneto-crystalline 
energy of about 7 × 107 erg/cm3 [1], and high Curie temperature of 477oC. FePt materials were 
usually fabricated by physical vapor deposition or chemical synthesis process. As-prepared films 
or nanoparticles were reported to exhibit an fcc disordered structure and magnetically soft 
property [2-12]. High annealing heat temperature is required for ordering transformation. This 
leads to overgrown FePt grain sizes and reduces the signal-to-noise ratio, considering the 
applications of magnetic recording media. 
According to previous reports, ordering temperature of FePt films can be lowered by alloy 
additions [2,3], induced stresses [4-6], excess microstructural defects [7-8], epitaxial growth of 
anisotropic FePt [9-10], or induced by CuAu L10 phase [11], etc.  
In the study, we found that degree of ordering was enhanced in the bilayer FePt/Mo and trilayer 
Mo/FePt/Mo systems. The mechanism will also be discussed from crystallographic and magnetic 
hysteresis data. 
 
II. EXPERIMENTAL 
 
Samples with different layer structures were deposited by rf magnetron sputtering on corning 
1737 glass substrates. The background vacuum is better than 2.0 × 10-7 torr. Each layer of Mo 
and FePt was 20 nm in thickness. FePt composite target was made by overlaying Pt foils on a 
pure iron disk. Single-layer, bilayer, and trilayer samples were deposited at room temperature, 
followed by a post-annealing at 350 or 400oC for a period 10-120 minutes in the vacuum 
chamber and immediately after sputtering. Magnetic properties were measured using a vibrating 
sample magnetometer (VSM) under a maximum applied field of 2T. Structural analyses were 
carried out using an 8 keV synchrotron radiation source. The chemical composition of FePt layers 
was confirmed to be Fe47Pt53 by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) method.

where (c/a)f is 0.956 for fully ordered FePt film [12]. Ordering parameters thus measured from 
Figure 2 are also listed in Table I. 
Volume fraction of ordered region, f0, can be obtained by analyzing the fundamental (200) peak. 
For disordered FePt phase, (200) diffraction peak is a single line. However, after ordering 
transformation, the lattice structure of the FePt layer changes from fcc to fct, splitting the 
fundamental (200) peak into superlattice (200) and (002) peaks. By separating the superlattice 
peaks, the f0 value thus can be measured from the following expression [13, 14]

where Efct and Efcc are the integral intensities of ordered and disordered phases, respectively. 
Figure 3 shows the X-ray slow scan profiles of <200> peaks for the Mo-layer introduced samples 
annealed at 350oC for 60 min. Coexistence peaks were obtained. Lorentzian fitting was used to 
separate the components of fundamental and superlattice diffraction peaks. The results showed 
that by introducing Mo uderlayer or Mo cap layer, the FePt/Mo interface can enhance the 
chemical ordering of the FePt thin films. The f0 values are also listed in Table I. 
For the FePt and FePt/Mo samples annealed at 400oC for 10-120 min, the coercivity is a 
function of annealing time, as indicated in Fig. 4. Hc increases with increasing annealing time for 
the three different Mo-layer introduced samples. For the FePt/Mo sample with a Mo underlayer, 
Hc was about 1 kOe higher than that of single-layer FePt. Coercivity of the trilayer sample is 
even more enhanced. 
We found that coercivities of bilayer and trilayer samples are highly dependent on the degree 
of ordering. Because Mo atoms are insoluble to FePt lattice, chemical composition of the FePt 
layer remains practically constant after annealed at 400oC [15]. Without a significant diffusion 
effect, we therefore consider that Mo/FePt interface is a key factor for the ordering enhancement 
of the FePt layer. As reported by Takahashi et al. [16] and Kawai et al. [17], the ordering 
transformation at low temperatures is predominated by nucleation controlled mechanism. In this

(top layer and underlayer) has a constant thickness of 60 nm while the thickness of FePt 
intermediate layer (d) is varied from 10 to 100 nm. Chemical composition of the FePt layer was 
analyzed by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy. Crystal structure was studied with 
an X-ray diffractometer (XRD). Microstructure was investigated using a transmission electron 
microscope (TEM). Magnetic properties were measured at 300 K using a SQUID magnetometer. 
 
III. RESULTS AND DISSCUSSION 
 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the trilayer Au/FePt(60 nm)/Au samples heated at 
different postannealing temperature (Ta) are shown in Fig. 1. After annealing at 400 oC, the FePt 
phase identified from the XRD pattern is not well ordered. The amount of Ll0 phase grows with 
the increasing Ta, as estimated from the relative intensities of the superlattice diffraction peaks. 
Ordering parameters S, which is usually used to determine the extent of the chemical order of the 
Ll0 phase, can be expressed by

where xPt and xFe are the atom factions of Fe and Pt, respectively; rPt and rFe are the fractions of 
Fe and Pt sites occupied by the correct atoms in the L10 structure; and yPt and yFe are, respectively 
the fractions of correct Fe and Pt sites. In a homogeneous Ll0 alloy, S = 1 indicates the perfect 
chemical ordering [14]. S value can be evaluated from the integrated intensities of the 
fundamental and satellite peaks in the diffraction profile of an Ll0 alloy [14]. S is increased with 
Ta up to a large value of 0.96 at Ta = 800 oC. Single-layer FePt also has a similar trend of S vs. Ta 
and exhibits a maximum S value of 0.95 after annealed at 800 oC. It is clear that single-layer and 
trilayer samples have perfectly ordered structure after annealed at high temperatures. Precise 
measurements of 2θ angles indicate that the trilayer samples exhibit a two-phase structure, well 
ordered FePt ordered phase and nearly pure Au phase even after annealing at 800 oC. It is clear 
that Au atoms do not diffuse into the L10 FePt lattice even after annealed at a very high 
temperature. 
Fig. 2 shows the relation between coercivities (Hc) and postannealing temperatures (Ta) for 
single-layer FePt (60 nm) and trilayer Au/FePt(60 nm)/Au samples. For both samples, 
coercivities are increased monotonically with the raising Ta up to the maximum investigated 
temperature of 800 oC. However, the trilayer sample has much larger Hc as Ta is higher than the 
starting temperature (500 oC) of L10 transformation. Besides the annealing temperature, 
coercivity is also strongly dependent on thickness of the FePt layer (δ) in single-layer or trilayer 
samples. Fig. 3 illustrates the variation of Hc with d as samples are annealed at 800 oC. Hc values 
of trilayer samples are approximately two times as large as those for the single-layer FePt. We 
also found that the Hc values of the trilayer samples are increased with decreasing d. A maximum 
Hc of 33.5 kOe was obtained for δ = 20 nm. Hysteresis loop of the high-coercivity trilayer film (δ 
= 20 nm) annealed at 800 oC for 30 min is also indicated in Fig. 4. The best coercivity 33.5 kOe 
is accompanied with a low remanence (Mr) of about 400 emu/cm3. The magnetic data are not yet

saturated due to the applied field of only 50 kOe. Smaller δ values (< 20 nm for trilayer sample 
and < 30nm for single-layer sample) leads to a decreases in Hc. 
Fig. 5 shows the microstructure and the selected area diffraction (SAD) patterns of an Au( 60 
nm)/FePt( 20 nm)/Au(60 nm) trilayer sample. Both the Au and the FePt ordered grains can be 
identified from the TEM images through EDS composition analysis. The FePt grains with an 
average size of about 70 nm are dispersed amid the large-grained (> 150 nm) Au matrix. SAD 
patterns indicate that the FePt phase shows an ordered L10 structure while Au exhibits an FCC 
structure. Compared to our previous work on top-layer diffusion [13], trilayer films have smaller 
FePt grain size and more uniform grain size distribution, together with better phase separation 
between Au and FePt. 
 
IV. SUMMARY 
 
We have investigated the magnetic properties, crystal structure, and microstructure of the trilayer 
Au(60 nm)/FePt(d nm)/Au(60 nm) samples. A maximum coercivity of 33.5 kOe can be achieved 
in a trilayer sample with δ = 15 nm. The Hc data of trilayer sample are much larger than those of 
single-layer FePt. X-ray diffraction data indicate that negligible diffusion of Au atoms into the 
ordered FePt lattice even the trilayer sample is annealed at high Ta. TEM photos illustrate a 
microstructure with FePt ordered particles dispersed amid large-grained Au matrix. We, therefore, 
consider that the high coercivity in Au/FePt/Au system is attributed to (i) well-ordered FePt 
phase, (ii) small FePt grain size and uniform grain size distribution, and (iii) perfect phase 
separation between FePt and Au.
