Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Region Controller Design via Region Switching 
and Robust Control Technique 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
In recent year, nonlinear systems have 
been described by Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy 
model in many literatures [1-6]. T-S fuzzy 
model consists of several subsystems which 
give each local linear representation by 
IF-THEN rules. The majority of this fuzzy 
controller designs were employed the concept 
of Parallel Distributed Compensation (PDC) 
[6-9] and Lyapunov stability criterion. This 
kind of problems can be converted into Linear 
Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) which are solved by 
LMI optimization [9-12]. However, the total 
number of LMIs is greatly increased if the T-S 
fuzzy model contains lots of plant rules. In 
addition, the PDC-based fuzzy controller 
involves many the controller rules so that the 
defuzzification is a time-consuming procedure. 
The foregoing are some of the problems 
we have to handle. This project uses the fuzzy 
region concept [13] to separate the original 
plant rules into several fuzzy regions. In doing 
so, only one partial fuzzy region is fired at the 
instant of each input vector being coming. 
Therefore, the purpose of this project is to 
design the feedback gains for each fuzzy region 
such that the overall T-S fuzzy model can be 
stabilized. In this project, the fuzzy model and 
controller derived from fuzzy region concept is 
called T-S Fuzzy Region Model (TSFRM) and 
T-S Fuzzy Region Controller (TSFRC), 
respectively. Since each controller rule of 
TSFRC has to stabilize several plant rules, the 
robust control techniques are employed in 
designing TSFRC. This project use Lyapunov 
stability conditions to analyze the stability and 
to synthesize TSFRC, which are expressed in 
terms of LMIs.  
The main contribution of this project is 
shown as follows. Because membership 
functions of TSFRC do not overlap with each 
other, the proposed idea can greatly reduce the 
total number of LMIs and controller rules when 
fuzzy model involving many plant rules. 
Therefore, TSRFC is easy to implement with 
simple hardware because it does not need to 
perform the defuzzication procedure. Finally, a 
numerical example is given to illustrate the 
validity of our proposed approach. 
II. PRELIMINARIES AND PROBLEM

A. Descriptions of T-S Fuzzy Systems 
This project considers the following 
discrete T-S type fuzzy plant model to 
represent a complex nonlinear system, which 
includes both fuzzy inference rules and local 
analytic linear models.

III. MAIN RESULTS 
In order to overcome these disadvantages, 
this project combines the fuzzy region concept 
and robust techniques to develop the 
region-based fuzzy controller such that the 
interference effect can be cancelled and the 
design results can be implemented with simple 
hardware. In this section, three important issues 
are discussed in the following: (i) Conversion 
of general discrete T-S fuzzy model into T-S 
Fuzzy Region Model (TSFRM), (ii) Definition 
of discrete T-S Fuzzy Region Controller 
(TSFRC) and (iii) Synthesis for the closed-loop 
fuzzy region systems. 
Suppose the membership functions of fuzzy 
system are triangular type. The fuzzy region 
concept can be demonstrated by use of Fig. 1. 
n21 ,  φφφ L,,  are the operating point of the 
premise state ( )kzn . Fig. 1 shows that the fuzzy 
region jnRegion  contains the right-hand side of 
( )n1j−M  and the left-hand side of jnM . The 
details of fuzzy region concept can be found in 
[13]. Based on the fuzzy region concept, the 
general T-S fuzzy model can be converted into 
TSFRM.
