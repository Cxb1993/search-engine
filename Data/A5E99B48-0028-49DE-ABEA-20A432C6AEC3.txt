hardware friendliness of H-QC codes. 
Our results are simulated on binary-input 
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. 
Fig. 1 shows that, with short to moderate lengths, 
H-QC codes would outperform MacKay’s 
random codes and PEG constructed random 
codes in high SNR region whether column 
weight J=3 or 4. Since the J=3, N=1014 H-QC 
code performs pretty close to the J=4, N=1026 
code, we can adopt the J=3 code for decoder 
implementation to save the number of functional 
units.  
Fig. 1 Performance of R 0.77, N 1000 codes. 
Fig. 2 shows that H-QC codes perform better and 
better with the length larger while PEG 
constructed QC codes have obvious error floors 
in the region of bit error rate less than 10-4. The 
performance improvement of H-QC codes 
obtained by increasing code length is probably 
equal to that of MacKay’s random codes. 
Fig. 2.  Performance of R=0.5, N=10080 ~ 40320 
codes. 
In conclusion, we have proposed a class of 
structured LDPC codes called hierarchical 
quasi-cyclic LDPC codes which perform well for 
long code lengths as compared to random codes. 
Due to the well organized parity check matrix 
structure, our codes consume less matrix storage 
and are fairly suitable for hardware 
implementation. We have already shown that the 
partially-parallel decoder architecture for QC 
codes can be modified to apply to H-QC codes. 
2.2 LDPC coded modulation for high spectral 
efficiency transmission 
Next, we have proposed a LDPC coded 
modulation scheme for OFDM system using 
multiple rate LDPC codes. The goal is to achieve 
better coding gain than using LDPC code 
directly as many standards do. We describe a 
LDPC coded multilevel modulation technique 
based on set partitioning and double Gray code 
labeling [1], called LCM. The LCM scheme is 
used only when square-shape constellations 
(2m-QAM, where m=1 or m>1 an even) are 
employed. The soft demapping at Rx is greatly 
simplified, because the a posteriori probability 
(APP) of each bit can be derived independently 
from the real or imaginary part of the noisy 
complex signals. The block diagram of  
partially encoding and symbol mapping is shown 
in Fig. 3. A transmitted symbol chosen from a 
2m-QAM symbol set can be divided to two 
binary m/2-tuples (rm/2-1, rm/2-2,…, r1, r0) and 
(im/2-1, im/2-2,…, i1, i0). The two tuples 
independently select two L-ary (L=2m/2) real 
symbols, representing the real and imaginary 
parts of the complex QAM symbol to be 
transmitted respectively.  The L-ary symbols 
belong to the set A = {Al = 2l-(L-1), l = 0, 1,…, 
L-1}. Each 2m-QAM symbol conveys C LDPC 
code bits on its real and imaginary part, 
respectively; the remaining U bits are uncoded. 
So there are U uncoded bits and C coded bits in 
each dimension, where U+C = m/2. 
and the error floor of LCM1+3 scheme is not as 
serious as LCM2+2. RS-LCM scheme has same 
coding gains as LCM scheme and does not have 
error floors at low BERs.  
2.3 Memory efficient LDPC decoder design 
We implemented a (12288, 6144) LDPC 
decoder on Altera Stratix II EP2S90 FPGA. The 
design uses 3257 (4%) ALUT and 307200bit 
(6%) RAM. The throughput of single threaded 
implementation is 9.1Mbps with number of 
iteration fixed at 15. The average throughput will 
be substantially increased by the use of 
syndrome test unit. The BER performance of our 
LDPC decoder is shown in Figure 5. The 
hardware implementation loss is less than 
0.025dB when compared with floating point 
simulation. The scheduling introduces no 
negative effect; the coding gain degradation is 
caused by the finite precision arithmetic 
operations.

Table 2 compares our architecture with other 
published designs. The result shows that 
Jump-Reset scheduling algorithm offers high 
hardware utilization with no bubbles. The 
memory addressing logic can be implemented by 
using simple counters. The matrix constraint is 
also much more relaxed compared with [2]. A 
RAM requirement of [3] is 64512bit and ROM 
requirement is 957415bit when N=9300. The 
normalized memory requirement of [3] is based 
on N=1020, K=210. Our memory requirement is 
also smaller than memory requirement of design 
[4] which uses compress method.

Our Jump-reset scheduling algorithm is 
hardware efficient. All the processing units are 
fully utilized in the decoding process. There is 
no exception and bubble in the scheduling.  The 
parity check matrix constraints are easy to meet. 
Our genetic algorithm based code search 
algorithm can find the suitable code matrix 
efficiently. This scheduling algorithm can be 
applied not only to scaling min-sum algorithm 
but also to sum-product algorithm. The 
jump-reset scheduling algorithm can be easily 
scaled to support multithread operation. The 
memory requirement of multithreaded 
scheduling architecture remains the same while 
the throughput is increased by the number of 
additional threads. The development of a 
multi-thread decoder is now in progress. 
3. Self Evaluation 
In this year, we proposed a LDPC code 
construction method that improves bit error rate   
performance and have low error floors. An 
efficient LDPC coded modulation scheme 
utilizing rate compatible LDPC codec is also 
proposed. Finally, a memory efficient LDPC

The 3rd IEEE ICCSC (International Conference on Circuit and Systems for Communication) is held in 
Bucharest, Romania for 7/6 and 7/7, 2006. The conference is held at the Politechnica University in 
Bucharest .   
 
For the first day, the plenary talks about the comparison of SiGe and Silicon for the use of wireless 
communication transceiver design. SiGe provides higher circuit performance but is difficult to integrate 
with the digital portion while Silicon is easy to integrate but with lower performance. Based on different 
system requirement, the implementation technology must be chosen carefully for optimal results. For 
example, Silicon is most suitable for low cost WLAN application while SiGe is suitable for 3G cell 
phone. The second talk is about ubiquitous computing. The speaker talks about autonomous car 
designed for DARPA challenges, and the importance of wireless sensor networks. He thinks the biggest 
challenge is how to integrate all different sensors in a platform and make everything works together. 
 
The first paper is for the design of automatic gain control system for MIMO OFDM. The author 
proposed a scheme with frequency orthogonal (FO) versus cyclic shifted (CS) preambles. The FO 
approach can give correct result while the CS method gives wrong answer due to signal superposition. 
It is possible to combine the AGC scheme with the peak to average ratio reduction (PAPR) for MIMO 
OFDM system. 
 
The 2nd talk is about software defined radios(SDR). Software defined radio uses a fast ADC upfront to 
digitize the received signal upfront and use DSP to process it later. FPGA is a good fit for SDR because 
it can be easily changed to adapt to different communication standards. This paper proposed early-late 
gate technique to handle the timing recovery task in the SDR. 
 
The third paper talks about wireless baseband transmission (WBT). It’s a direct radiation of digital data 
sequence without modulation in any sense. Manchester code is used in transmission. This scheme 
attempts to eliminate the need of analog circuits in the system. It’s similar to UWB system that it has a 
very large bandwidth. They build a actual system to verify their proposed system. But this system uses 
up the whole bandwidth, which make it very difficult to co-exist with any other system. 
 
The afternoon brings a paper about how to measure spectrum occupancy. There are many different 
technologies, such as analog, TDMA, UWB, …. And for unlicensed band, it is difficult to know who 
might be there. Results for 900Mhz and 2.5Ghz band are shown. RF power needs to be measured over 
large frequency bands, with very high sensitivity, resolution and dynamic range. 
 
I presented two papers in this conference. The paper from our lab is titled “LDPC coded modulation for 
high spectral efficiency transmission”. I also presented another paper for Prof. In-Jer Huang on the topic 
of adaptive PCM codec design.

Abstract− This paper investigates efficient low-density 
parity-check (LDPC) coded orthogonal frequency 
division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation schemes 
for fixed wireless application. We use partially LDPC 
coded with double gray code labeling technique and 
Reed-Solomon code with LDPC Coded Modulation 
(RS-LCM) to achieve better performance than the 
conventional LDPC bit-interleaved coded modulation 
(BICM) scheme. RS-LCM scheme outperforms BICM 
scheme by 0.4 dB at a BER of 10-5.

I. INTRODUCTION 
 Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes are a class 
of linear block codes. A (N, K) LDPC code is specified 
by a very sparse parity-check matrix having M rows, N 
columns and the code rate is R=K/N, where K=N-M. It 
was originally invented by Gallager in 1963 [3] and 
rediscovered by Mackay and Neal recently [4]. LDPC 
codes can achieve reliable transmission for coding 
performance that is very close to the Shannon’s limit and 
can outperform Turbo codes at long block length but with 
relatively low decoding complexity. LDPC has been 
adopted as the DVB-S2 standard. 
Trellis Coded Modulation (TCM) proposed by 
Ungerbock [1], Multilevel Coding (MLC) proposed by 
Imai/Hirakawa [2] and Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation 
(BICM) introduced by Zehavi [3] are famous coded 
modulation schemes that can achieve both power and 
bandwidth efficiency. Most papers investigating the 
capacity and threshold of LDPC coded modulation focus 
on 8PSK constellation. This paper investigates the 
                                                 
  This work was supported in part by the National Science Council of 
Taiwan ROC under Grant 94-2752-E-002-008-PAE , 94-2220-E-002-

performance of LDPC coded OFDM modulation schemes 
on higher order QAM modulations. 
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) 
is a multi-carriers modulation technique that has multi-
path delay spread tolerance and immunity to frequency 
selective fading channel. High spectral efficiency and 
efficient modulation and demodulation by IFFT/FFT are 
also advantages of OFDM. Therefore, OFDM has 
emerged as a widely used modulation scheme for next 
generation high speed wireless transmission applications.  
For example, DAB, DVB-T, UWB, IEEE 802.11 a/g/n, 
and 802.16a are all OFDM based communication systems. 
LDPC code has recently achieved performance 
approaching Shannon’s limit by using iterative decoding. 
The combination of high spectral efficiency OFDM 
modulation technique and LDPC code will be a good 
candidate for high speed broadband wireless applications. 
For example, IEEE 802.11n proposal takes rate-
compatible LDPC code as an advanced coding option, 
and IEEE 802.16e proposal is based on OFDM 
modulation and adopt LDPC code as one of its FECs. 
Almost all the applications mentioned above adopt 
LDPC code by directly adding it in front of modulator by 
using Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM) scheme. 
In this scheme, a bit-interleaver is added after the encoder 
with Gray labeled constellation to improve code diversity, 
and hence the reliability of coded modulation. The coded 
bits are interleaved bit-wise and grouped into blocks of m 
labeling bits c0, c1,…, cm-1. The signal point labeled by c0, 
c1, … , cm-1 is transmitted through the channel. When 
LDPC is used as component code in this scheme, the bit-
interleaver is not needed. The permutation property of the 
columns in the parity-check matrix is equivalent to an 
interleaver. [7] 
At the receiver, the encoded bits are decoded using the 
reliability information generated by the soft demapper 
from the noisy received signal yk. The a posteriori 
probability (APP) of code bit cl is equal to x = 0, 1 as

The APP for decoding is also separately produced from 
the real part and imaginary part of the received signal. 
Assume y = A + n is the real part of a noisy signal over

B. Reed-Solomon LDPC Coded Modulation (RS-
LCM) Scheme 
  This RS-LCM scheme is a concatenated coded 
modulation scheme, which takes an extra Reed-Solomon 
code as outer code and the LCM scheme as inner code. 
The LCM scheme suffers error floor at low bit-error rate 
when low rate codes are used. The outer RS code can 
eliminate the errors caused by threshold decoding of the 
uncoded part in the LCM scheme. 
 
Fig. 3 Reed-Solomon with LDPC-coded modulation (RS-LCM) 
WiMAX OFDM-256 PHYs 
  In the Tx end, the information bits are encoded by the 
outer Reed-Solomon encoder, which is derived from a 
systematic RS (N=255, K=239, T=8) using symbols from 
GF (28), and the bits are then encoded using the LCM 
scheme. At the Rx, the inverse operations of the Tx 
recover the transmitted information bits. 
III. Simulation Results and Analysis 
  In the simulation, the LDPC codes used in all 
schemes are code length N = 6000 regular LDPC codes. 
The parity check matrix is generated randomly and the 
maximum iteration times of decoding are set to 20. 
Because modern applications required high spectral 
efficiency transmissions, so we use 256-QAM for 
investigation. Since 256-QAM has more freedom choices 
at each dimension of constellation, we can use the LCM 
scheme either with 1 uncoded bit with 3 coded bits or 2 
uncoded bits with 2 coded bits (abbreviated these as 
LCM1+3 and LCM2+2). Simulations run using various 
spectral efficiencies of these two configurations are listed 
in Table 2 and Table 3.
