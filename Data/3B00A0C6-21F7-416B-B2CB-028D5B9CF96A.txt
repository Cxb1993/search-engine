and is called the conventional simple matrix 
(CSM) model for simplicity. The CSM 
model is valid for the displays without 
primary shift and primary crosstalk, such as 
cathode ray tube (CRT) displays. The 
backward CSM (BCSM) model can be easily 
derived from the CSM model because the 
chromaticity-matrix device model is linear 
and the TRCs of the three primaries are 
independent of one another. Unfortunately, 
there are primary shift and two-primary 
crosstalk for liquid crystal displays (LCDs) 
[1,2]. Primary shift is the variant primary 
chromaticity that is due to the spectral 
transmittance of liquid crystal cell changed 
with applied voltage. Two-primary crosstalk 
may come from the signal interference 
between neighboring LCD cells [1,2]. 
Several methods have been used to improve 
the CSM model for LCDs by optimizing the 
chromaticity matrix and TRCs for a set of 
measurement data [2-4]. Reference 2 
introduces the parameter optimized simple 
matrix (POSM) model that optimizing the 
coefficients of TRCs and the chromaticity 
matrix by the simulated annealing method 
and the regression method, respectively. 
Because their model equations are the same, 
the backward POSM (BPOSM) model can be 
easily implemented with the same way as the 
BCSM model. 
Further improvement of the forward 
model of the LCD with primary shift and 
two-primary crosstalk can be achieved with 
the two-primary crosstalk (TPC) model [1]. 
The TPC model is represented with the set of 
three simultaneous algebraic equations that 
comprise the offset constants, one-color 
terms, and two-color-product terms. The 
coefficients of the TPC model equations can 
be obtained from measurement data by 
regression. However, the TPC model 
equations cannot be analytically solved for 
the signals because the equations are 
nonlinear. Therefore, the backward TPC 
(BPTC) model equations cannot be explicitly 
expressed. It was shown that the accuracy of 
the POSM model is significantly better than 
that of the CSM model but is less than that of 
the TPC model [1]. For taking the accurate 
advantage of the TPC model, in this work we 
use an iteration method to solve the TPC 
model equations so that the BTPC model can 
be implemented.

Signals can be represented by the vector 
(R, G, B), in which R, G, and B are red, green, 
and blue components, respectively. The 
values of R, G, and B lie between 0 and MAX, 
in which MAX=2M-1 for the M-bit digital 
system. In this work, we consider the 8-bit 
digital system and MAX =255. For simplicity, 
we normalize signals as r= R/MAX, g= 
G/MAX, and b= B/MAX so that the 
normalized signals 0≦r, g, b 1. The TPC ≦
model assumes that the relation of the 
stimulus value S (S= X, Y, Z) and the 
normalized signal vector (r, g, b) can be 
described by the equation [1]

where P and Q are the integer constants; aS0 
is a constant representing offset value; and 
the coefficients aSik and cSijlm (i, j= r, g, b; k= 
1, 2, …P; l, m= 1, 2, …Q) are constants. In 
Eq.(1), the terms with rk , gk , and bk are 
one-color terms; and the terms with rlgm, 
glbm , and blrm are two-color-product terms. 
Primary shift and two-primary crosstalk can 
be described by one-color terms and 
two-color-product terms, respectively. The 
coefficients in Eq.(1) can be optimized from 
the measurement data set given below by 
regression. 
The TRC coefficients and chromaticity 
matrix of CSM model are calculated from the 
black point corresponding to the signal 
vector (R, G, B)= (0, 0, 0), and the 
one-primary data set given by (R, G, B)=( I[i], 
0, 0), (0, I[i], 0), (0, 0, I[i]), where i= 1, 2,…7 
and I[i]={36, 72, 109, 145, 182, 218, 255}.

solutions. If an output solution is negative, 
we take it as 0.0.  If an output solution is 
larger than 1.0, we take it as 1.0. 
The two LCD monitors tested in 
References 1 and 2 are taken as examples in 
this work, which are ViewSonic VA520 and 
VG151 LCDs. The same data measured in 
the two references are used so that the 
detailed characteristics of the CSM, POSM 
and TPC models of the two monitors can be 
referred from the two references. The 
monitors are respectively controlled by the 
same desktop computer. They are wormed up 
for an hour before they are measured so that 
measurement data do not drift with time. The 
monitors are measured at the center of the 
display and perpendicular to the face. 
Tristimulus values are measured with Photo 
Research PR650 spectroradiometer. The 
accuracies of the color device models are 
measured with the CIEDE2000 color 
difference formula for 224 test samples, 
which are chosen by randomly selecting R, G, 
and B values for their signals. The average 
color difference of the test samples is 
denoted as Δ E00,avg. For the minimum    
ΔE00,avg, the optimal TRC and SNT orders of 
CSM and POSM models, respectively, are 
the same and the optimal order N= 4. For the 
CSM and POSM models of VA520, Δ
E00,avg = 2.88 and 1.33, respectively. For the 
CSM and POSM models of VG151, Δ
E00,avg = 2.93 and 2.02, respectively. With the 
same forward model, the accuracy of VA520 
is better than that of VG151 because its 
primary crosstalk is lower [1,2]. It was found 
that, for VA520 (VG151), the average color 
difference of the TPC model is the minimum 
when the orders P= 5 (6) and Q=2 (2), in 
which ΔE00,avg = 1.19 (1.21). 
The accuracy of a backward model is 
estimated from the 224 test samples as the 
method used in Reference 2. The backward 
model is used to convert the measured 
tristimulus values of the test samples to the 
output signals, and the tristimulus values of 
the output signals are interpolated from the 
three-dimensional look-up-table (3D-LUT) 
model using an 8 8 8× ×  lattice. The 
measurement data set of the 3D-LUT model 
is (R, G, B)=( L[i], L[j], L[k]), where i, j, k= 1, 
2, 3, …8; L[i]= {0, 36, 72, 109, 145, 182, 
218, 255}. The number of the measurement 
data is 512 for the 3D-LUT model. The data 
that is not measured can be calculated from 
the measurement data by the tetrahedral 
interpolation. The average color differences 
of the 3D-LUT model are 0.89 and 1.04 for 
VA520 and VG151, respectively. For the 
BCSM and BPOSM models of VA520, Δ
E00,avg= 2.95 and 1.27, respectively. For the 
BCSM and BPOSM models of VG151, Δ
E00,avg= 2.96 and 2.32, respectively. 
The average color difference of the 
BTPC model depends on the values of etol 
and Nmax set for the termination conditions of 
the iteration. Empirically, we take etol = 1.0 
and 0.55 for VA520 and VG151, respectively. 
The output solutions can converge in the 
presence of larger iteration errors in the 
iteration for VA520. Figures 2, 3, and 4 show 
the average color difference, average number 
of iteration times, and number of failure 
counts versus the maximum number of 
iteration times Nmax for the BTPC model, 
respectively. The number of failure counts is 
the number of the test samples that their 
iterations terminate due to the termination 
condition (ii). The BTPC models taking the 
normalized output signals of BCSM and 
BPOSM models as initial trial solutions are 
denoted as the BTPC[BCSM] and 
BTPC[BPOSM] models, respectively. In 
Figure 2, the average color difference of the 
case with Nmax= 0 is the average color 
difference of initial trial solutions. Because 
the TPC model of VA520 is more accurate 
than that of VG151, the BTPC model of 
VA520 is also more accurate than that of 
VG151. Figure 2 shows that the accuracies of 
BTPC[BCSM] and BTPC[BPOSM] models 
are about the same. But, for VG151, the 
accuracy of the BTPC[BCSM] model is not 
as stable as that of the BTPC[BPOSM] 
model with respect to Nmax. From Figure 2, 
one can also see that the average color 
difference converges when the maximum 
numbers of iteration times are larger than 3
