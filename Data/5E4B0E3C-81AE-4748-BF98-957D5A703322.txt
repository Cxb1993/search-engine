1.Location awareness via multimodal localization 
techniques including GPS, WiFi/Bluetooth radio. Our 
new cooperative localization uses (1) the distance 
provided by the short-range radios and (2) exchange 
of GPS coordinates between devices in the proximity 
to improve the localization accuracy.  Our research 
has been published in the 2011 IEEE IWCMC conference. 
 
2.We have measured the power consumption of various 
localization techniques available in the existing 
Android smart phones. Three energy models for GPS, 
WiFi-based, and cell-tower based localization are 
then developed. Based on the models, we develop an 
algorithm to dynamically select the optimal 
localization technique. Our algorithm  real-time 
monitors user mobility and the location update 
frequency specified by the application, and 
determines the most energy-efficiency localization 
technique.  The algorithm has been implemented in the 
Android phones to demonstrate its performance. The 
research result is also submitted to IEEE 
Transactions on Wireless Communications.

I. ÂâçË®Ä 
The whole class of aforementioned new services is often referred to as social 
networking software (SNS). SNS is a class of applications whose scope is to facilitate 
social interaction among interconnected persons who exploit the Internet and the 
media convergence process. Social networking software and its mass adoption are 
regarded as the second wave of Internet revolutions since the emergence of World 
Wide Web (WWW) service. According to comScore, a leader in measuring the digital 
world, the entire world has witnessed a 25% growth in the number of unique visitors 
of social networking sites, from 463 million in 2007 to 580 million in 2008. In Europe, 
the growth rate is even higher (35%). The well-known social networking website ‚Äî 
Facebook ‚Äî is now the second most popular website with 300 million photos 
uploaded daily, 3.2 billion likes and comments posted daily and 526 million daily 
active users. The huge amount of users along with the generated traffic is followed by 
new revenue generation.  
The emergence of new online services such as Facebook, MySpace and LinkedIn 
has dynamically changed the social life of individuals and their use of Internet. 
Friends and family members now tightly connect to each other via real-time, 
content-rich updates including texts, pictures and video clips (e.g., Facebook or 
Twitter). People also expand their social networks by meeting new people with 
common interests, similar professional experiences or educational backgrounds online 
(e.g., Match.com, LinkedIn and Classmates.com). With the help of these highly 
interactive social networks that virtually have no time and geographic limitations, 
individuals have more profound impacts on public interests while entrepreneurs 
embrace unprecedented opportunities to create new business and profits. Furthermore, 
with some new mobile technologies, the online SNS has been pushed to a new level. 
Different technologies --- including wireless PAN (such as Bluetooth), wireless LAN 
(e.g., IEEE 802.11) or wireless WAN (e.g., 3G, WiMax, LTE, etc) --- provide two 
compelling features that cannot be matched by their wired counterpart. First, SNS 
users can share personal information, anytime and anywhere, with the help of mobile 
technologies. Second, users are able to generate location information, which is very 
useful for both users and online SNS providers. With location information, users not 
only know ``what their friends are doing" but also ``where they are right now''.  For 
example, both Facebook and Google provide so-called check-in services by which 
users can share their current locations with friends. One can foresee that a user's 
online social network will interweave itself into its physical counterpart with the help 
of mobile online SNS in the near future.

III. ÊñáÁçªÊé¢Ë®é 
A. Cooperative Localization 
Localization in wireless networks is not a new problem. Various localization 
schemes have been proposed for cellular, sensor, or robotic networks. Most of 
the existing schemes assume that devices have no built-in capability to obtain 
their own geo-coordinates. The assumption makes perfect sense in the cases 
where (i) devices of interest are only equipped with simple radios, or (ii) 
absolute geo-coordinates (i.e., longitude and latitude) are not required by 
applications. 
In the former case, anchors are usually used to provide geo-coordinates for 
devices. In short, radio information between anchors and devices such as time of 
arrival (TOA) or angle of arrival (AOA) is gathered to determine the distances 
and relative directions. Based on the information, along with the anchors' 
geo-coordinates, the position of devices can be determined via triangulation, 
trilateration or multilateration. In a cellular network, base stations (BSs) assume 
the role of anchors [A.1][A.2][A.3]. In [A.4], WiFi APs are used as anchors to 
locate a criminal. It is assumed that APs' geo-coordinates and their transmission 
ranges are provided in advance. To locate a criminal, the probing messages 
between the criminal's device and APs are gathered. An overlapping coverage of 
the APs, identified by the probing messages, can then be determined based on the 
APs' geo-coordinates and transmission ranges. The centroid of the vertices of the 
overlapping coverage is calculated and considered as the estimation of the 
criminal's location. In [A.5], a cooperative GPS scheme is proposed when some 
users in a group cannot receive signals from 4 GPS satellites. The users share 
their pseudorange information obtained from the GPS receiver and the relative 
positions with each other. Using information gathered from the neighbors (like 
anchors), a user that cannot accurately locate itself would be able to improve the 
6 
 
       As we will show in this report, the proposed MMSE estimator could provide 
up to 80% improvement on localization error, depending on the degree of 
information mismatch. 
B. Energy-efficient Localization for online SNS 
Different energy-saving localization schemes/strategies have been proposed 
for handheld devices. For devices that are equipped with a single localization 
technology (e.g., GPS), the design focused on using embedded sensors to reduce 
frequent location updates. In Entracked [B.1], the authors claim that a user often 
stays static inside a building and thus, does not need (frequent) location updates. 
By tracking user movement using the embedded accelerometer, GPS could be 
turned off when a user is considered static. In that case, the user‚Äôs last know 
location is used by LBS.  
In [B.2], a hybrid GPS/accelerometer/compass scheme using both 
accelerometer and compass to estimate the user‚Äôs location based on Newton‚Äôs 
law of motion is proposed. The compass reading determines the direction of 
motion while the accelerometer reading can be integrated twice to derive the 
displacement along the direction of motion. However, the error when using 
accelerometer and compass accumulates over time because of the noise in the 
sensors. Therefore, the GPS is turned on infrequently to get an accurate position 
estimate and reset the error. The energy consumption of the different sensors, 
including GPS, accelerometer, and compass, is also profiled to quantify the 
advantage of using the accelerometer/compass as compared to the GPS. 
In CompAcc [B.3], the use of GPS is reduced even when a user is moving. 
First, a device learns a user‚Äôs walking pattern via rhythmic accelerometer 
readings. According to their study, GPS only needs to be turned on every 472 
steps to update user location in a campus. Between two GPS updates, user 
location is estimated with the help of a map tile. A map tile contains walking 
trails in the neighborhood and must be pre-loaded to the handheld device. By 
combining walking patterns and digital compass readings, along with the 
preloaded map tile, a user location can be determined.  
For devices equipped with multiple localization technologies, the design 
mainly focused on switching between different technologies. In EnLoc [B.4], the 
authors considered both GPS and WiFi-based localization. They claimed that 
users have habitual activity patterns, which can be used for energy-saving 
localization. A unique op-map is first generated by learning a user‚Äôs habitual 
activity patterns. Based on the op-map and an initial location, EnLoc then 
8 
 
Even though the existing schemes applied different techniques for 
energy-saving localization, most of the schemes assumed that GPS is the most 
energy-consuming technology. However, we argue that it may not always be the 
case for the state-of-the-art handheld devices. 
IV. Á†îÁ©∂ÊñπÊ≥ï 
A. Cooperative Localization 
Given that the accuracy of network-based localization is less controllable, an 
enhancement scheme using heterogeneous radios and local cooperation is 
proposed. The proposed scheme assumes that user i has acquired its 
2-dimensional geo-coordinates, ùê∫ùëñ, from the network-based localization. Take 
users A and B in Figure A-1 as an example. We have ùê∫ùê¥ = ùê¥ùëÉ1+ùê¥ùëÉ2+ùê¥ùëÉ33  and 
ùê∫ùêµ = ùê¥ùëÉ1+ùê¥ùëÉ4+ùê¥ùëÉ53 , where ùê¥ùëÉùëñ represents the geo-coordinates of ùê¥ùëÉùëñ obtained 
from the network-based localization. In general, APs scanned by different users 
in the same neighborhood are different and therefore, ùê∫ùê¥ ‚â† ùê∫ùêµ. 
As suggested by our experiment result, the actual position of user ùëñ, ùëÉùëñ, is 
modeled as a uniform random variable in a circle centered at ùê∫ùëñ with a radius of 
ùëÖùëñ. ùëÖùëñ in our model represents the localization uncertainty of the network-based 
location and is not necessary the WiFi transmission range of user ùëñ. The model 
captures the localization uncertainty and ensures tractability of the following 
mathematical analysis. Furthermore, it is assumed that users ùëñ and ùëó exchange 
their geo-coordinates (i.e., ùê∫ùëñ and ùê∫ùëó) and measure their distance, ùëüùëñùëó, using 
short-range radios such as Bluetooth or WiFi, whenever in the radio vicinity of 
each other. Different measurement schemes based on the received signal strength 
(RSS) or time of arrival (TOA) have been proposed and the details are beyond 
the scope of this report. To capture the imperfection of distance measurement, 
ùëüùëñùëó is also modeled as a random variable in this report. In general, ùëüùëñùëó ‚â† ùê∫ùö§ùê∫ùö•ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ 
given that neither the localization infrastructure nor the short-range radio is 
perfect. We refer ùëüùëñùëó ‚â† ùê∫ùö§ùê∫ùö•ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ to as information mismatch in this report. 
10 
 
where 
 
 
 
and 
 
. 
This model can be further extended to support three or more users. The final 
result of three-user scheme has the following form: 
 
which is very similar to the two-user case. In this project, we use the mean 
square error (MSE) as the evaluation metric of the proposed scheme: 
ùê∏ùëÉÔøΩùëñ = ÔøΩùê∏ ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩùëÉùëñ ‚àí ùëÉÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ2ÔøΩ . 
The improvement is defined as 
ùêºùëñ = ùê∏ùê∫ùëñ ‚àí ùê∏ùëÉÔøΩùëñùê∏ùê∫ùëñ , 
where ùê∏ùê∫ùëñ is the MSE of Gi. The numerical results of 2- and 3-user cases are 
shown in the following table.  
12 
 
introducing a third user into cooperation could further improve localization 
accuracy. In general, an additional 20% to 30% improvement can be obtained; 
that is, a total of 70% improvement can be achieved. It is noted that in some 
cases, say Cases 18 and 19, the additional improvement is negligible (< 3%). In 
these two cases, the legitimate area of user B is only slightly reduced with the 
introduction of user C. This can be best illustrated in Figure A-2. When 
ùëÖùê∂ + ùëüùêµùê∂ is large enough so that the circle centered at ùê∫ùê∂ with a radius of 
ùëÖùê∂ + ùëüùêµùê∂$ (i.e., ùê∂ùê∂‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ ) completely covers the intersection of ùê∂ùê¥‚Ä≤  and ùê∂ùêµ , the 
legitimate area of user B remains unchanged. As a result, the improvement 
contributed by the third user is insignificant. 
 
Figure A-2. Multi-user cooperation: ùëÅ = 3 
The results of the 3-user case in Table A-I suggest the ‚Äúdiminishing 
marginal return‚Äù (i.e., ùêºùëü,ùêµ‚Ä≤ <ùêºùëü,ùêµ) when more users are involved in cooperation. 
To better understand the phenomenon, different N's --- the number of cooperating 
users --- are considered. The resulting improvement of user B for ùëÅ = 2 ùë°ùëú 8 is 
plotted in Figure A-3. 
14 
 
in a substantial performance degradation (varying from 15% to 20%).  
The main reason of such degradation is that user $B$ is not uniformly 
distributed in the shadow area as one may assume. Figure A-3 suggests that 
centroid-based approximation provides comparable performance as the proposed 
scheme when the number of cooperating users, N, is larger.  However, as we 
explained earlier, a larger N implies increasing signaling and computational 
overhead, let alone that there may not be so many users simultaneously in the 
vicinity. 
B. Energy-efficient Localization for online SNS 
We use the Android platform to develop the energy models of existing 
localization technologies. The Application Programmer Interfaces (APIs) in the 
Android platform can be divided into two parts, namely the network provider 
and the GPS provider. The network provider combines WiFi- and cell 
tower-based localization to provide user location. The GPS provider simply 
depends on the embedded GPS receiver. In our experiment, a device can access 
the Internet via cellular networks (e.g., 3G) or wireless local area networks (e.g., 
WiFi). The WiFi-radio could be turned off between location updates to reduce 
power consumption. Based on these options, the Network Provide can operate in 
one of the four modes shown in Table B-1. Take NetOn,WiFi as an example. This 
mode represents that a device keeps the WiFi radio on and accesses the Internet 
via WiFi as well. Take NetOnOff,3G as another example. This mode represents that 
a device turns on the WiFi radio when a location updated is needed, and turns it 
off once a location is obtained. In the meantime, the device stays connected to 
the Internet via 3G. 
 
Table B-1. THE FOUR LOCALIZATION SCHEMES OF THE NETWORK 
PROVIDER 
In what follows, the developed energy models of existing localization 
technologies will be shown. Based on the energy models, we then propose a 
16 
 
response and finally (iv) calculate the location. In this duration, the average 
current is around 110 mA, compared to 50 mA in the idle period where no 
location update is requested. 
 
Figure B-1. The energy model of NetOn,3G when the user moves continuously 
(2) NetOnOf f ,3G (Moving): The resulting energy model is shown in Figure B-2. 
Since the WiFi radio is turned off temporarily, it takes some time for the WiFi 
radio to become functional. In our measurement, such transient time, denoted as 
Ton, is about 5.3s on average. The current in this transient period is much higher 
than that in Figure B-1 as one can expect. It then takes almost the same time Treq 
= 2.3s as in the case of NetOn,3G to provide the location update. After that, the 
WiFi radio is turned off again. Our measurement shows that it takes about Toff = 
3.5s to turn off the radio and another Tshut = 9s for the radio to fully enter the 
OFF state. Note that the current in Tshut decreases from 205 to 50 mA gradually 
(not linearly) in our measurements. We use the average current (100 mA) instead 
in that period. Based on the energy model, one can conclude that if Tp < 20, it 
makes no sense to turn off the WiFi radio given that Tsleep = Tp(Ton+Treq+Toff 
+Tshut ) and Ton+Treq+Toff +Tshut = 20.1s. 
An interesting observation from Figure B-2 is that the current in the OFF 
state is almost the same as that in the idle state of Figure B-1. The observation, 
together with the transient surge current, makes NetOnOf f,3G an unattractive option 
when a user moves continuously. 
18 
 
(4) NetOnOf f,3G (Static): Figure B-4 shows the energy model using NetOnOff,3G if a 
device stays static. Compared to NetOnOf f,3G (Moving), NetOnOf f,3G (Static) spends 
less time (1.3s vs. 2.3s) and less energy (150 vs. 205 mA) while the time to turn 
on, turn off and shut down the WiFi radio remains almost the same.  
 
Figure B-4. The energy model of utilizing NetOnOff,3G when a device stays static 
(5) NetOn,WiFi (Static): The energy model of NetOn,WiFi if a user stays static is 
almost the same as NetOn;3G (Static) shown in Figure B-3. The only difference 
is that the IDLE current in NetOn,WiFi (Static) is 50mA, which is much higher than 
NetOn,3G (Static). 
(6) NetOnOf f,WiFi (Static): Finally, Figure B-5 shows the energy model of NetOnOf 
f,WiFi if a user stays static. Unlike the energy models introduced earlier, Treq = 
44.5s is exceptionally long. 
20 
 
Tsleep = Tmin(Toff +Tshut) 
We also observe that if the GPS Provider cannot provide a location update 
(e.g., indoors), the GPS receiver will keep searching for 57.5s before entering the 
SLLEP mode based on the setting of Tmin. 
 
Figure B-6. The energy model of the GPS Provider 
The experiment results show that while using the GPS provider on the 
Android platform, it provides 11 locations, even though only single update is 
needed. In fact, a device can take advantage of the 11 locations and extend Tsleep. 
For example, there is a service and its Tp is 50 seconds. Instead of wasting the 10 
locations, a device returns the first location and the last location to the service. A 
device does not return a location to the service every 50 seconds. Instead, the 
duration of returning a location is 10,50,10,50, ... . By doing so, Tsleep is extended 
from 26.5 to 36.5 seconds. The new localization scheme which takes advantage 
of the GPS provider is defined as GPSSP. GPSSP is achieved by setting Tmin as 
Tmin=max{Tp-Tsearch, 0}. 
  
22 
 
Figure B-8. NetOn,3G is the most power-saving localization scheme regardless of 
Tp. Figure B-7 and Figure B-8 show that when GPS is available and Tp is larger 
than 60 seconds, GPSSP is recommended. Otherwise, no matter GPS is available 
or not, NetOn,3G is recommended. If 3G is unavailable, a device uses NetOn,WiFi 
when Tp is smaller than 60 seconds. Otherwise, NetOnOf f,WiFi is recommended.

v. Performance Evaluation 
The existing positioning APIs in Android provide a function which is 
getBestProvider() for developers to select a provider. The function returns a 
provider based on criteria. There are six criteria which are power requirement, 
accuracy, bearing, speed, cost allowing, and altitude. Here, we compare the 
proposed algorithm with the best provider when the accuracy is fine. The best 
provider when the accuracy is fine is denoted as BPfine. 
We design three scenarios which are Traveler, Biker, and Shopper for the 
evaluation. 
(1) Scenario Traveler: A traveler uses a tracking type of LBS. A traveler would 
like to see as much scenery as possible, so the time using LBS extends to 11 
hours. The detail of a traveler‚Äôs itinerary is shown in Table B-2. In this scenario, 
Tp is 300 seconds. 
 
Table B-2. The itinerary of a traveler 
(2) Scenario Biker: In this scenario, a biker uses a navigation type of LBSs for 8 
hours. The detail of the biker‚Äôs schedule is shown in Table B-3. In this scenario, 
Tp is 5 seconds. 
 
Table B-3. The daily schedule of a biker 
(3) Scenario Shopper: Unlike a biker who stays outside continuously, a shopper 
shops in a big outlet outdoors. A shopper walks into stores which block satellite 
signals to shop frequently. In this scenario, we suppose that a shopper stays in a 
store for 5 minutes and enters a store every 10 minutes. In this scenario, Tp is 10 
seconds. 
The experimental improvement is defined as the following equation:  
im = (Cb-Cp)/Cb, 
where im is the improvement ratio, Cb is the average current when using BPfine 
and Cp is the average current when using the proposed algorithm. Table B-4 
shows the experimental improvement in three scenarios. The results show that 
the proposed algorithm consumes at least 30 percent of energy less than BPfine.

the battery life for 2.4 hours. 
 
Figure B-10. The extension of battery life in scenario Biker 
 
Figure B-11. The extension of battery life in scenario Shopper 
The experiment results in three different scenarios show that the proposed 
algorithm extends the life time of using LBS. In addition, the proposed algorithm 
is not influenced by user behavior. Instead, the proposed algorithm adapts with 
user behavior and selects the best localization scheme. On the other hand, BPfine 
cannot offer a location when GPS is unavailable. Worst of all, BPfine wastes 
energy on searching satellite signals.
