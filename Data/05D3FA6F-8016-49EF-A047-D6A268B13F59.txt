Introduction 
With the help of powerful methods developed for high-throughput screening (Ogawa and 
Shimizu, 1999) and functional analyses of cell genomes (Rehm, 2001), new enzymes with 
industrial potential are expected to be extensively explored. This large progress will lead to the 
need for producing enzymes in an efficient manner. To achieve this, a producer cell of robustness 
is necessary. Apparently, Escherichia coli meets this requirement, because of its comprehensive 
characterization, fast growth, and easy manipulation.  
 Enhancement of recombinant protein production in E. coli still remains challenging in spite 
of many promising efforts. Among strategies previously proposed, the issue of reduction of 
acetate formation receives the most intensive study, usually giving an encouraging outcome 
(Aristidou et al., 1995; March et al., 2002). As well recognized, in a glucose-containing medium 
E. coli commonly produces acetate irrespective of oxygen, and this existing fact has been 
ascribed to the result of improper regulation of glucose uptake rate and the limited activity of the 
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (EI-Mansi et al., 1989). Therefore, approaches to decrease 
glycolytic flux were proven useful to reduce the formation of acetate. These methods include 
employing a mutant strain with a modified glucose consumption rate (Chou et al., 1994), using a 
carbon source with tightly-regulated uptake rate (Aristidiou et al., 1999), controlling the feeding 
of glucose (Shiloach et al., 1996), and redirecting metabolic flux in central metabolism (Chao and 
Liao, 1993; Farmer and Liao, 1997).   
 Indeed, the physiological response of producer cells to overproduction of recombinant 
proteins is manifold and complex (Kurland and Dong, 1996). In particular, “protein burden” 
presents to be a common event, which could lead to growth-rate depression of protein-producing 
cells and consequently discourage the attempt to achieve high-level production of proteins. 
Despite of the limited activity of TCA cycle, the requirement for amino acids derived from TCA 
cycle could account for 48%, as revealed by the analysis of the composition of total proteins 
needed for producing 1 gram of E. coli cells (Fig. 1) (Neidhardt et al., 1990). This implies that an 
acute imbalance flux in central metabolism may arise if precursor metabolites from TCA cycle 
are constantly and intensively withdrawn by the forced production of a cloned gene product. As a 
result, it may lead to the metabolic stress which further restricts cell growth and protein 
production. It is evident that to eliminate this flux imbalance by replenishing the intermediate 
metabolites in TCA cycle should provide a potential way to improve protein production.

origin (BD Bioscience Clontech) containing GFP fused to the lac promoter was used.  
 
Analytical methods 
The sampled cells were disrupted by French Press and followed by centrifugation to obtain 
the supernatant as cell free extract (CFX). The protein content in CFX was determined using 
Bio-Rad dye reagent with bovine serum albumin as the protein concentration standard.  
According to the assay kit (K-ASPTM, Megazyme), L-Asp concentration was determined 
by converting it into oxaloacetate (OAA) based on the reaction mediated by glutamate-OAA 
transaminase (GOT) as follows: 
L-Asp + α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) ??glutamate + OAA 
To start the reaction, various level of L-Asp (0.5 mL) was added into the reaction solution (1.5 ml) 
consisting of 0.32 M α-KG, 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 0.125 mM pyridoxal-5-phosphate, 
12.75 U GOT (Sigma). Following the appearance of OAA as determined previously (Chao and 
Liao, 1993), it led to an estimation of the equilibrant constant of the reaction as 0.092. Based on 
the estimated constant, the amount of L-Asp in the unknown sample can then be determined by 
the measurement of OAA.    
 
Immunoblotting  
Proteins in CFX were analyzed by dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 
(SDS-PAGE) conducted on 12% acrylamide gels as described (Chao et al., 2002). To perform 
immunoblotting assay, after electrophoresis, protein spots were blotted onto nitrocellulose 
membranes using Electrophoretic Transfer Cell (BioRad) and then hybridized with a rabbit 
GFP-specific antibody (BD Bioscience Clontech) at 1:1,000 dilution for 3 h. Followed by two 
washes, the horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) was 
administrated for 3 h. Finally, two washes were additionally applied, and 4-chloro-1-naphthol 
was added to allow the HRP-mediated color change to develop. The concentrations of protein 
images were determined using Image Analyzer GAS9000 (UVItech, England).  
 
Enzyme assays  
The activity of aspartase was determined according to the method as described (Chao et al., 
2000). The unit (U) of aspartase activity was defined as µ moles of fumaric acid produced per 
min, and its specific activity in terms of U/mg was obtained by dividing U with the dry cell 
weight (DCW) used in the enzyme assay. In addition, the measurement of β-galactosidase 
activity essentially followed the previous method (Miller, 1972), and its specific activity was 
denoted as Miller unit.   
 
Results 
Controllable expression of aspA by IPTG  
Aspartase is known to be repressed in aerobic growth of E. coli on glucose (Woods and 
Guest, 1987). Therefore, to endow E. coli strain with aspartase activity under such a condition,

VJS676/pACYC184/pTac-Z and BL21/pACYC184/pGFPuv, respectively. The cells carrying the 
lacZ-born plasmid were cultivated in shake flasks containing MGA medium. As shown in Fig. 3a 
and 3b, the induced strain VJS676/pACYC-AspA/pTac-Z exhibited a better growth and produced 
a higher amount of β-galactosidase as compared to the induced control strain 
(VJS676/pACYC184/pTac-Z). As a result, it leads to a 40% and 5-fold increase in biomass yield 
and β-galactosidase production, respectively. However, this positive effect on cellular growth and 
protein production was absent for the induced strain VJS676/pACYC-AspA/pTac-Z when L-Asp 
in MGA medium was substituted with fumarate (Fig. 3a and 3b). In addition, the examination on 
the GFP production was administrated by growing the GFP-producing strains. As depicted in Fig. 
4, the cell bearing active aspartase (BL21/pACYC-AspA/pGFPuv) produced a 5-fold more GFP 
than that obtained by the control strain (BL21/pACYC184/pGFPuv). Moreover, the cell density 
of aspartase-expressing and control strains reached 6.4 and 5.1 at OD550, respectively.  
 
Discussion 
Consistent with the identification of a homologous region of CAP and FNR recognition sites, 
the expression of aspA subject to the regulation of glucose and oxygen has been confirmed 
experimentally (Woods and Guest, 1987). Although its physiological function remains unclear, 
aspartase plays an essential role in L-glutamate degradation in E. coli (Marcus and Halpern, 
1969). To be controllable artificially, aspA was fused to the IPTG-inducible promoter on the 
plasmid. As a result, the cell transformed with the plasmids became capable of differentially 
expressing aspA in response to various IPTG (Table 1). In a preliminary study, a forced 
production of aspartase turned to be detrimental to the growth of producer cells in MG medium 
(Fig. 2a) probably because of the metabolic burden resulting from aspartase overproduction. 
However, this defective growth characteristic of aspartase-producing cells could be eliminated 
when L-Asp was included in the medium. Obviously, under such a condition the function of 
aspartase is responsible for the conversion of L-Asp into fumarate (see Fig. 1). In E. coli, an 
anaplerotic pathway known to be catalyzed by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (Ppc) which 
incorporates CO2 into PEP to give OAA. As well characterized, the physiological activity of Ppc 
is inhibited by L-Asp and malate and activated by fructose-1,6-diphosphate, acetyl coenzyme A, 
GTP, and guanosine tetraphosphate (Morikawa et al., 1980). Therefore, in the medium containing 
L-Asp as employed here, the carbon flux from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to OAA is likely 
reduced in E. coli due to the repressed Ppc activity by L-Asp. Under the aerobic condition, OAA 
is probably replenished by the aspartase-mediated pathway starting from the deamination of 
L-Asp to fumarate which is further directed to OAA with the concomitant generation of NADH 
via a serious reaction in TCA cycle (Fig. 1).  
 It was further demonstrated that producer cells with the aspartase activity enabled to greatly 
enhance the production of recombinant proteins without compromising their growth (Fig. 2b, 3b, 
4). This could be mainly attributed to the direct effect of the deamination activity of aspartase, 
since no improvement in protein production was obtained when cells were grown on the MG

As commonly recognized, the excretion of acetate by the aerobic 
growth of Escherichia coli on glucose is a manifestation of imbalanced 
flux between glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. 
Accordingly, this may restrict the production of recombinant proteins 
in E. coli, due to the limited amounts of precursor metabolites 
produced in TCA cycle. To approach this issue, an extra supply of 
intermediate metabolites in TCA cycle was made by conversion of 
aspartate to fumarate, a reaction mediated by the activity of L-aspartate 
ammonia-lyase (aspartase). As a result, in the glucose minimal medium 
containing aspartate, the production of two recombinant proteins, 
β-galactosidase and green fluorescent protein, in the 
aspartase-producing strain was substantially increased by 5 folds in 
association with 30-40% more biomass production. This preliminary 
study illustrates the great promise of this approach used to enhance the 
production of these two recombinant proteins.?
