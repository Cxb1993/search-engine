2attributes and its manufacturer's track record for environmental achievement [27]. Therefore,
how to meet the consumers’ need is an important issue. 
Lummus and Vokurka [23] suggested that companies must learn to pull products through
supply chain, that is, learn to manage “demand chain”, rather than to push products. Demand 
chain can be defined as a complex web of business processes and activities that help firms
understand, manage and ultimately create customer demand [21]. It can help managers to
analysis and understand overal demand for markets within the firm’s curent and potential 
product range. Supply chains emphasize the efficiencies in the production and logistics
processes; the demand chains emphasize the effectiveness in the business [40].
Customer Features and Classification
Because green products and traditional product are sold at the market simultaneously in
the beginning, most peripheral equipments or environments all rely mainly on traditional
products, resources for serving green products are relatively limited and it causes the
inconvenience and higher price for obtaining a green product. Therefore, apart from setting up
the complete recycling channel and mechanism, it is an important subject that how to identify
customers who would like to bear with the inconvenience or pay higher price when it has not
been widely used. It has been proved that the demand for green products is quite different
between different markets [27].
For efficient position their green products, the one who is likely to be concerned about
environmental issues need to be identified and such a green customer is caled as a “target 
customer”. Through the afirmation of the target customers and through the perfect marketing 
channel moreover through perfect tracing system, enterprises can really transmit the selling
information to the user who has wills to buy and can enable enterprises to recycle the used
products effectively and make more profit. Therefore, we need to efficiently segment the
customers and different marketing strategies meeting the requests of customers can be
provided to different segmentations.
Many studies focused on the profiling of the green customers by using different kinds of
segmentation variables [4, 5, 11, 31, 34, 38, 39]. Kolter [20] suggested that an efficient
segmentation needs to satisfy measurability, substantiality, accessibility and actionability.
Traditionally, the measures used to segment are the socio-demographics, such as age, location,
social class and the psychological variables, such as personality and behavior variables such
as purchasing frequency [14, 20]. The most widely and relatively easily used variables for
profiling are the socio-demographics, Diamantopoulos et al. [11] summarized the associations
in the past studies between socio-demographics: gender, martial status, age, number of
children, education and Social class. They addressed shortcomings identified in previous
studies and concluded that the weak utility of socio-demographic variables for profiling green
consumers according to their pro-environmental purchasing behavior by statistical hypothesis
inferences in their serial studies [4, 5, 11, 31]. The more suitable variables for profiling the
green purchase on all components of environmental consciousness were suggested to be the
knowledge about green issues, attitudes towards environmental quality, and levels of
environmentally sensitive behavior [4, 11, 31]. Tanner and Kast [37] uncovered personal and
contextual factors that influence green food purchases by Swiss consumers, four categories of
measures of specific attitudes, perceived barriers, knowledge and personal norm are used to
check the relevant impact on environmental behavior. Their study confirmed that personal
norms and perceived monetary barriers were not significant, place of residence, household
size, education, occupational level, employment status and household income were not among
the relevant predictors and personal attitudes and beliefs are power predictors of green
purchases [37]. Straughan and Roberts [34] examined the characteristics of ecologically
conscious consumer behavior and indicated that demographics, including age, sex, income,
4different criteria in a cardinal manner and the EGP is used to obtained optimal solution with
tradeoff between maximum average agreement solution and the most balanced solution.
Nonlinear Programming
Facing the different characteristics of a demand chain, enterprises should not only think to
make profit but also listen to customers’voice— their requests regarding to similar and
environmental-friendly products but not much expensive. Based on the win-win concept, a bi-
objective nonlinear problem was constructed to derive the optimal price that satisfied the
maximization of customers’utility and product price simultaneously in this study. When the
weights are given by a DM, it will be transformed into a weighted problem. There are many
methods focused on the solution of general constrained optimization [2, 11]. According to
different shapes and forms of nonlinear programming problems, different types were
categorized and solution procedures were proposed accordingly. For example, the gradient
search procedure for a multivariable unconstrained convex problem; the Karush-Kuhn–
Tucker conditions for constrained problem; an extension of simplex method for separable
programming; some sequential-approximation algorithms for convex programming. With the
assumptions of convex programming, it was proved that any local optimum is also a global
one, but it is not true for a nonconvex programming problem [11]. Therefore, a common
approach is to apply an algorithmic search procedure, e.g. sequential unconstrained
minimization technique, to find a local optimum and repeat the procedure to find more local
ones as possible and generate a global one [11]. As regarding the recent studies, Meng et al.
[25] reviewed the existing penalty function and proposed an objective penalty function
method to solve this kind of problem. They developed a new algorithm to generate a globally
optimal solution to a constrained nonlinear problem, called OPFM algorithm. With some
special conditions, OPFM is proved to be a convergent algorithm [25]. Nesterov [26]
compared the methods and complexity of the existing interior-point methods to solve a
nonlinear programming. Potra and Wright [30] reviewed the key development of some
existing interior-point methods and gave comments about the complexity for some types of
problems. Zhu [43] presented a new interior-point algorithm for nonconvex nonlinear
programming, two linear equation systems need to be solved for an iteration. Numerical
experiments were used to illustrate the effectiveness of their algorithm. Zhou and Shi [42]
proposed a numerical algorithm to solve the local optimum by solving an ordinary differential
equation, and this algorithm provides a great possibility for solving large-scale problems.
Many authors devoted themselves to the approximate methods, for example, Padberg [28]
compared two existing literature and proposed an improved method of approximating
separable functions to mixed integer problems.
III. Methodology
In order to identify the target customers, we need to collect the customer information first.
When the data of customers are collected, we have the personal information and their
preferences of some green products. Different groups of customers will generate different
patterns of demand. After clustering, each utility function for each cluster can be obtained by
MAUT. Incorporating with the objective function of producers, bi-objective nonlinear
programming problems will be constructed to obtain compromised prices of different clusters.
The target customers of different characteristics of customers can be identified and
segmenting price can be performed to gain more benefit of both customers and producers.
The framework of the proposed method is shown and illustrated in the following:
63Utility function construction
After clustering analysis, suppose we have N attributes Naa ,...,1 and denote jx be the payoff
under attribute ja and )( j
i xu
j
be the corresponding utility value of cluster i, j=1,…,N. An
exponential utility function of each cluster is defined as follows:

The utility function ju can be obtained by first setting the normalized utility value of the
best payoff jx of attribute j as 1)( ji xu j and the utility value of the worst payoff jx of attribute
j as 0)( ji xu j , and using the mid-value-splitting technique [18] to obtain the parameter ij by
asking DM for which payoff value

4Weight Elicitation
Suppose we have iT customers in cluster i and
i
jnw be the preference weight of attribute j of
the nth member of cluster i by using Max100 method. The EGP model [8, 22] is used to
obtain the aggregated weights
ijW of attribute j, j=1,…,N. For example, by solving the
following system, we have the aggregated weights

more and more important. Consumers who concern about the
environment are increasing. Promotion of green products has
been recognized as a basic method of solving resource waste
and improving environment pollution. Since this kind of

simultaneously in the early stage of development, production
resources for serving green products are relatively limited
and it causes the inconvenience and higher price for obtaining
a green product. Therefore, it is an important subject that how

and make more profit
In this study, we applied data mining techniques to cope
with this problem; a list of questionnaires was performed to
carry out the preferences of the customers’ behaviorand
preferences. After clustering the customers, a bi-objective
nonlinear problem was constructed with MAUT, the target
customers can be found to be the foundation of marketing for
selling the right goods to the right person in a correct way.

I. Introduction
Due to the running out of raw materials in the near future,
environmental protection issues become more and more
important; the consumers who are concerned about the
environment are increasing. Green products can reduce the
negative environmental impact while still maintain or
improve cost and quality needs, promotion of green products
has been recognized as an excess for solving resource waste
and improving environment pollution. In consequence, green
marketing becomes a trend of business management which
requires the frequent interaction between consumers and
producers to ensure the 3R of reusing, remanufacturing, and
recycling.
Because this kind of products and traditional product are
sold on the market at the same time in the beginning, most
peripheral equipments or environments all rely mainly on
traditional products, resources for serving green products are
relatively limited and it causes the inconvenience and higher
price for obtaining a green product. Therefore, apart from
setting up the complete recycling channel and mechanism, it
is an important subject of how to identify customers who
would like to pay higher initial price when it has not been
widely used. Through the affirmation of the target customers
and through the perfect marketing channels not only the
enterprises can really transmit the selling information to the
users who are willing to buy and assist the enterprises in
recycling effectively and make more profit; but also the
customers are more informative to get new products or
service again with a lower price or get compensation.
The one who is willing to buy a green product with higher
price or sacrifices his/her convenience is caled a “target 
customer”in our context. To investigate the product value
with respect to such target customers will provide a company
a good reference on pricing the products.
To achieve the above goals, we need to efficiently cluster
customers into different segmentations according to different
preferences for green products. The Multiattribute Utility
Theory (MAUT) was used to develop the aggregated
fulfillment of obtaining such a product. Based on the win-win
concept, a bi-objective model was constructed to derive the
optimal price that satisfies the maximum of both the
customers’utility and producers’benefit simultaneously.
Based on the characteristics of the customers’ clusters, the 
target customers can be found and this will be the foundation
of marketing. Therefore, we can sell the right goods to the
right person with value gained to the company. Based on the
above ideas, the literature review was discussed first. Then,
the theoretical development and the basic structure of the
model were constructed.
II. Literature Review
Supply–Derived Market
Environmental protection issues have become important
around the world; the consumers who are concerned about
the environment are increasing. Businesses have been quick
to accept concepts like environmental management systems
and waste minimization, and have integrated environmental
issues into all organizational activities [29]. Businesses and
industries need to provide products and services which
promise the environmental responsibility to preserve their
markets and safeguard their reputation for a cleaner Earth
[27]. Ottman [27] indicated the differences between the
conventional and green marketing. The objective of
There are some assumptions regarding to MAUT, preferential
independence, utility independency and additive
independence. Different models are constructed for different
situations satisfying the above assumptions [9, 18, 24].
Keeny and Raiffa [18] developed a procedure for determining
an appropriate model. Among them, the additive utility
model is the most well-known and widely used one [8].
Stewart [35] constructed a simulation model to test the
assumptions of the completeness, transitivity and additive
independence of criteria and the use of additive value
functions has been proved to be a consistent and reliable one,
even if the nonlinearities exist.
Regarding the weight elicitation, there are many research
focused on the comparison of different weighting methods [6,
7, 12, 17, 32, 33]. Different results were obtained from
different viewpoints but most of studies indicated that
different ways of eliciting attribute weights yield similar
results. For example, Jaccard et al. [17] evaluated the
convergent validity of six methods of measuring attribute
importance (elicitation measure, information-search measure,
direct rating, conjoint measure, subjective probability
measure and thurstone measure). They concluded that there
was relatively little convergence between methods and the
conclusion made about attribute importance may quite
different depending on the method used to assess importance.
Bottomley and Doyle [7] compared the properties and
performance of three weight elicitation methods: direct rating,
Max100 and Min10. They found that the weights produced
by Max100 were somewhat more reliable than DR and
people actually preferred using Max100 and DR rather than
Min10.
When a set of individual weights is obtained by decision
makers, a compromised rakings need to be determined.
González-Pachón and Romero [13] reviewed past studies and
proposed a methodology EGP based on goal programming
(GP) that allowed the aggregation of individually ordinal
preferences [13]. An extended model of a weighted bi-
objective programming was proposed to derive a compromise
solution of minimization of aggregated disagreement between
DMs and maximum disagreement [13]. Based on their study
in 1999 and MAUT, Linares and Romero [22] developed an
overall sustainability function for Dutch dairy farming
systems. This approach consisted of four steps: determination
of attribute utility functions, assessing attribute weights to
determine utility functions per aspect, assessing aspect
weights to determine the overall sustainability function per
stakeholder group and determination of the overall
sustainability function for society by aggregating preferences
of stakeholders and experts. When the preferences provided
by several social groups from different criteria in a cardinal
manner and the EGP is used to obtained optimal solution
with tradeoff between maximum average agreement solution
and the most balanced solution.
Nonlinear Programming
Facing the different characteristics of a demand chain,
enterprises should not only think to make profit but also
listen to customers’voice— their requests regarding to
similar and environmental-friendly products but not much
expensive. Based on the win-win concept, a bi-objective
nonlinear problem was constructed to derive the optimal
price that satisfied the maximization of customers’utility and
product price simultaneously in this study. When the weights
are given by a DM, it will be transformed into a weighted
problem. There are many methods focused on the solution of
general constrained optimization [2, 11]. According to
different shapes and forms of nonlinear programming
problems, different types were categorized and solution
procedures were proposed accordingly. For example, the
gradient search procedure for a multivariable unconstrained
convex problem; the Karush-Kuhn–Tucker conditions for
constrained problem; an extension of simplex method for
separable programming; some sequential-approximation
algorithms for convex programming. With the assumptions of
convex programming, it was proved that any local optimum
is also a global one, but it is not true for a nonconvex
programming problem [11]. Therefore, a common approach
is to apply an algorithmic search procedure, e.g. sequential
unconstrained minimization technique, to find a local
optimum and repeat the procedure to find more local ones as
possible and generate a global one [11]. As regarding the
recent studies, Meng et al. [25] reviewed the existing penalty
function and proposed an objective penalty function method
to solve this kind of problem. They developed a new
algorithm to generate a globally optimal solution to a
constrained nonlinear problem, called OPFM algorithm. With
some special conditions, OPFM is proved to be a convergent
algorithm [25]. Nesterov [26] compared the methods and
complexity of the existing interior-point methods to solve a
nonlinear programming. Potra and Wright [30] reviewed the
key development of some existing interior-point methods
and gave comments about the complexity for some types of
problems. Zhu [43] presented a new interior-point algorithm
for nonconvex nonlinear programming, two linear equation
systems need to be solved for an iteration. Numerical
experiments were used to illustrate the effectiveness of their
algorithm. Zhou and Shi [42] proposed a numerical algorithm
to solve the local optimum by solving an ordinary differential
equation, and this algorithm provides a great possibility for
solving large-scale problems. Many authors devoted
themselves to the approximate methods, for example,
Padberg [28] compared two existing literature and proposed
an improved method of approximating separable functions to
mixed integer problems.

Since S is a connected and compact set, and all i
j
f are
continuous and the level set of if
0
is bounded, it is proved
that the OPFM algorithm converges and derives the optimal
solution to problem (5). If there are some integer variables in
the proposed model, the MIP branch and bound algorithm [16]
will be used to find the solution.
Therefore, the target customers of different characteristics
of customers can be identified and segmenting price can be
performed to gain more profit for enterprises.
