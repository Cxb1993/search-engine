電器、變頻器、馬達驅動器…等等外，還可
以有跨領域的應用，例如：以脈衝電場產生
器和紫外線產生器作為農作物之害菌抑制或
殺菌、食品加工之非熱殺菌、飲用水之殺菌、
水耕蔬菜用水之殺菌、採收後水果之殺菌，
以電穿孔技術(採用低脈衝電場)作基因轉
殖、經皮給藥、局部電療…等等。 
單純的電力電子應用產品由於其大量製
造技術較成熟，價格日益低廉，而且相關產
業逐漸外移，所留下的研發人力勢必要另尋
出路，因此，跨領域的產品研發乃是留在台
灣的產業所必需面對的。為了使我們的研究
對產業有更多的貢獻，我們與植物醫生(農作
物病蟲害防治研究人員)、微生物專家及藥物
傳輸研究人員共同合作來進行跨領域的研
究，希望能擴大電力電子產品的應用範疇，
提昇生物科技的技術層次，增加產品的附加
價值，並且對環境保護和身體健康做出實質
的貢獻。 
我們之所以選擇用高脈衝電場作為病菌
之抑制或殺菌，主要是此方面之文獻上已有
初步成果的記載，而且方興未艾；更重要的
理由是(1) 最佳的高脈衝電場之滅菌效果將
因病菌和受處理物種類而異、(2) 系統化的殺
菌機制尚未建立、(3) 動態滅菌系統技術尚未
成熟、(4) 有許多是台灣獨有的病害，因此，
切入這些研究，可創出我們的研究特色，可
以開創新的特色產業。根據生物細胞所含物
質特性，深入瞭解滅菌的機制並建立模型
後，將可容易延伸至其他應用。這些觀點已
經與合作夥伴取得共識，相信一定可以有可
觀的研究成果產出。 
(二) 目的： 
本研究之主要目的是要藉由暨有的研究
基礎，做跨領域的整合研究，以提昇所研發
系統的附加價值，並且跟上時代的發展趨
勢，減少對環境的破壞，進而造福人類。 
根據以上的宗旨，我們所規劃的研究主
題，朝向以脈衝電場的物理方式作為食品之
抑菌或滅菌應用，以降低化學物質的使用和
提昇食品加工後的品質，並降低食品在加工
處理過程中所導致營養成份的流失，因此，
我們將研製寬脈波疊加窄脈波和純窄脈波之
脈衝電壓產生器，依需求調整電極間距，以
產生高脈衝電場，其脈衝振幅、脈寬、頻率
和波形皆可調，以作為食品加工之抑菌或滅
菌，朝向實用性商品邁進。於本年度之研究，
我們將原有之脈衝電壓產生器改良成可結合
超音波震動器之新結構，以便在殺菌時能減
少電極上之附著物，提昇殺菌效益。此外，
將根據過去較成熟的研究成果，如串聯式高
壓開關及其驅動電路模組化，並且建立設計
與測試平臺，以便於後續研究之進行。 
三、研究方法 
以脈衝電壓作為殺菌或抑菌的工具，首
先必須瞭解其機制，才能達到最佳殺菌效
果，因此我們將先探討菌種細胞之等效電路
模型。根據細胞的組成，一般可將一個細胞
及懸浮體等效成如圖一所示之模型。在圖一
(b)中，電容 Cm 大於電容 Cn，因此低頻寬脈
波電場對外層膜 (Outer Membrane)較有作
用，而高頻窄脈波電場對內層膜(Intracellular 
Membrane)較有作用。各種頻率和電場在細胞
的外膜和內膜上的跨壓可由圖二來表示，由
文獻上得知，當在細胞上的跨壓超過約 1 Volt
時，會造成細胞內之細胞質極化，而致無法
行使原有之功能，即達到殺菌或抑制的效果。

開關能夠同時 turn-on 和 turn-off 及能夠有均
勻的耐壓，也是本研究當中另一個挑戰重
點，為了克服上述的問題，我們將在脈衝電
壓產生電路中採用不同的切換頻率，來探討
多顆 MOSFET 或 IGBT 串聯的驅動特性，並
且加入額外的輔助電路，來儘量縮減各開關
在 turn-on 及 turn-off 的時間差。 
最後的設計重點在於 L-C 諧振網路及脈
衝變壓器 Tr2 及 Tr3 的設計，因 L-C 諧振網路
會經由變壓器提供窄脈波的能量供給負載，
使其能夠增加殺菌的效果。然因其瞬間窄脈
波所提供的能量很大，如何設計與挑選 L-C
元件及脈衝變壓器為此電路設計的挑戰點。 
綜合上述之分析及說明，高脈衝電場產
生器之研製極富挑戰性，尤其脈衝變壓器的
高容量設計、雜散效應、多顆 MOSFET 或
IGBT 串聯使用之難度以及如何達到高壓絕
緣的需求，須一一克服。另外，開關驅動電
路設計也是一大考驗，依過去的經驗告訴我
們，很多電路必須實作後才能斷定是否真正
能動作。希望藉由本研究能累積高壓處理和
產生的經驗，以便提供給國內外有興趣者參
考，並且也能落實技術於產業界之應用。

The main objective of this project is to design and implement 
programmable high and low pulsed-electronic-field generator 
(FEFGs) for the applications of transdermal drug delivery (TDD), 
crop sterilization, nonthermal liquid food sterilization and drink water 
sterilization. In the high pulsed-electronic-field generator, a wide 
pulses stacked with narrow pulses is adopted to prevent a continuous 
air breakdown and increase sterilizing effectiveness. A converter 
equipped with an interleaving scheme is proposed to generate the de-
sired pulses. In the low pulsed-electric-field generator, a rotational 
electric field is adopted to increase drug delivery effectiveness. A 
full-bridge converter with an active clamp to generate pulse voltages, 
which supply the power to multi-electrodes in a patch to achieve rota-
tional electric field. As mentioned above, it can be found that the 
proposed programmable high and low pulsed-electric-field generators 
can effectively achieve microbe sterilization and drug delivery, re-
spectively.

Abstract - In this paper, a sequential color light emitting diode
(LED) backlight driving system for liquid crystal display (LCD) 
panels with area control is proposed. Due to improvement on 
luminous efficacy, fast response, long life, mercury free, and wide 
color gamut, LED has gradually substituted for cold cathode 
fluorescent lamp (CCFL) as backlight. Although some novel 
CCFLs with low content of mercury and wide color gamut have 
been proposed, it is difficult to shorten their on-off transition. 
Recently, a novel display technique, namely area control, 
requiring backlights with fast response has been proposed to 
improve the contrast ratio of LCD and reduce power consumption 
of the backlights. With the area control, a panel is partitioned into 
several areas, and the back-light brightness of each area is 
controlled individually. In addition, color sequential display (CSD) 
is introduced to further reduce the power consumption. A 
sequential color LED backlight driving system with area control 
has been built, from which experimental measurements have 
verified the feasibility of the proposed driving system.  
I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, due to improvement on luminous efficacy, 
fast response, long life, and wide color gamut, LED has 
gradually substituted for cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) 
as backlight [1]-[3]. Although some novel CCFLs with low 
content of mercury and wide color gamut have been proposed, 
it is difficult to shorten their on-off transition to be compatible 
with LED. Recently, a novel display technique, namely area 
control, requiring backlights with fast response has been 
proposed to improve the contrast ratio of LCD and reduce 
power consumption of the backlights. With a conventional 
display technique, the brightness of an LCD panel is only 
controlled by twisting the conduction angles of liquid crystals. 
While, with the area control, the panel is partitioned into 
several areas, and the back-light brightness of each area can be 
controlled individually. With this approach, the contrast ratio of 
LCD panels can be improved significantly and the power 
consumption can be reduced dramatically [4].  
In addition, color sequential display (CSD) is introduced, 
further reducing the power consumption. In an LCD TV, the 
backlight driving system consumes most of the power due to its
extremely low light utilization efficiency (LUE) at a color filter. 
Without the color filter, LUE can be improved about 2.7 times 
[5]-[10]. In a sequential color display, a frame is decomposed 
into RGB sub-frames, which are displayed sequentially at short 
time intervals so as the human eye cannot perceive the timing 
latency. Within a field time interval which is 1/3 of a frame 
period, scanning over a whole panel, operation of liquid crystal, 
and flash of its backlight must be completed. The CSD 
technique applied to LCD panels was not popular due to poor 
response time of liquid crystals. Recently, the optical 
compensated birefringent (OCB) mode was adopted to speed 
up the response of liquid crystals. Thus, the CSD technique has 
been brought to our attention. 
II. OPERATION OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM
The proposed sequential color LED backlight driving system, 
as shown in Fig. 1, consists of a boost converter for power 
factor correction (PFC), a multi-output flyback converter, RGB 
LED arrays with sequential controlled switches (SR0, SG0,…,
etc.), and the proposed IC with the major features of area 
control and multi-LED-string current regulation. In this section, 
the emphasis is on the operation of the driving system and the 
proposed IC, which are explained briefly as follows: 
Fig. 1. Block diagram of the proposed LED backlight driving system with an 
area control. 
29471-4244-0655-2/07/$20.00©2007 IEEE
Fig. 5. Operational timing diagram of the proposed IC. 
The other major feature of the proposed IC is 
multi-LED-string current regulation. LED arrays should be 
driven by constant current to emit constant light intensity and 
avoid thermal runaway. The variable resistance of the active 
switches (SR0, SG0,…, etc.) are utilized to regulate the LED 
driving current, while the power converter provides constant 
voltage sources VR, VG, and VB. The switches are operated at 
their saturation regions under normal conditions. When a single 
LED is in short-circuit, the current will go beyond its current 
rating so as through a negative feedback, the gate voltage will 
be reduced to drive its corresponding switch to a linear region. 
Thus, multi-LED-string current regulation can be achieved. 
However, if too many LEDs are in short-circuit, the switch 
must block a high voltage while still allows current to flow 
through, which will result in a thermal problem, and finally all 
LEDs might be damaged. Hence, it is necessary to protect the 
switches. When one of the feedback voltages is higher than a 
threshold voltage Vp, the output voltage of its corresponding 
comparator will go to a high level, causing the inverting output 
of its corresponding D flip-flop also going to a high level. The 
channel is therefore turned off and the failure indication signal 
(FI) will not be pulled low until the supply voltage Vcc is reset. 
Thus, switch protection can be achieved, and reliability of the 
system can be improved. 
In addition, the proposed IC is expandable by connecting the 
SDI pin and serial data output (SDO) pin when the number of 
areas is larger than the number of channels, and it is suitable 
for various kinds of LED backlights, such as white LED, 
RGB-LED, and sequential color LED backlights. 
III. DESIGN AND PRACTICAL CONSIDERATION
In a practical circuit design, determining component values 
and designing thermal protection circuits for switches should 
be considered and they are described in detail as follows:  
A. Determination of Resonant Component Values 
It is necessary to store enough energy in resonant inductor Lr
to achieve ZVS features at turn-on transition, so as resonant 
inductor Lr must satisfy the following inequality [11]:

Substituting the specifications into the above inequality yields 
that Lr > 42.3 μH. The resonant frequency formed by resonant 
inductor Lr and clamp capacitor Cclamp should be sufficiently 
low to avoid voltage ringing across the switches when they are 
turned off. However, the clamping performance cannot be 
improved by using a bulky capacitor. A good compromise is to 
select the capacitance so that one half of the resonant period is 
longer than the turn-off time of switch S1. Hence,

Substituting the specifications into the above inequality yields 
that Cclamp > 290 nF. 
B. Determination of Sensing Resistor 
To improve signal-to-noise ratio of the feedback voltage, the 
sensing resistor should be determined properly. However, the 
total power dissipation Pd on the sensing resistor increases with 
its resistance, and it can be estimated as

where R is the sensing resistance, N is the number of areas, and 
Ton_r, Ton_g and Ton_b are the turn-on time intervals of red, green 
and blue LED arrays, respectively. The curves showing the 
relationship between Pd and R for different numbers of N are

Fig. 14 shows current and voltage waveforms during switch

illustrates that a protection for switches can be realized and 
system reliability can be improved.

system, from which it can be seen that the maximum efficiency 
can reach as high as 95 %. Fig. 16 shows the photograph of the 
panel and the color test equipment. The luminance of the 
module is around 500 cd/m2 when the backlight consumes only 
60 W, and the color gamut measured by color analyzer

Fig. 17, in which the inner solid triangle represents 100 % of 
NTSC, and the outer triangle with white solid line represents 
the color gamut of the panel with LED backlight. Hence, the 
proposed system is relatively feasible for a 32-inch LCD TV, 
which has been verified by the experimental results.

Abstract - Interleaving control schemes are widely used in
converter applications. Merits of such control methods are to 
reduce the input/output current or voltage ripples and volume, 
and to increase the processed power capacity of converters. 
For converters with constant operation frequency, it is easy to 
achieve interleaving control. However, it is difficult to realize 
interleaving features with variable operation frequency, such 
as boost-type power factor correctors (PFCs) operated in 
critical-mode (CM) condition. This paper proposes several 
interleaving controllers for CM boost PFCs. Analysis and 
design of the interleaving controllers are first described in 
detail. Moreover, simulated results of CM boost PFCs with 
two-phase and four-phase interleaving controllers are 
introduced. Finally, experimental results of a two-phase 
interleaved CM boost PFC are presented to verify the 
discussed features. 
I. INTRODUCTION
Converters with critical mode (CM) or discontinuous 
conduction mode (DCM) operation have zero voltage 
switching (ZVS) or zero current transition (ZCT) features, 
which will lead to low conduction loss and low switching 
loss, while most of converters with continuous conduction 
mode (CCM) operation have high switching loss and 
complicated controllers. However, the current or voltage 
ripple of the converters with CM/DCM operation is higher 
than those with CCM operation, which leads to a 
requirement of high current rating devices. Converters in 
CM/DCM operation are mostly used for low power 
applications [1]-[3]. 
Interleaving operation can be adopted to increase the 
processed power capacity, while still keep low current or 
voltage ripple [4]-[7]. Since most converters with CM 
operation must vary their switching frequency, it is difficult 
to generate gate signals for the converters with interleaving 
operation. In this paper, interleaving control schemes are 
discussed and several kinds of two-phase shifters 
(interleaving controllers) for CM interleaved boost 
converters functioning as power factor correctors (PFCs) 
are proposed, and some of them are extended to n phases 
for allowing more converters in interleaving operation. The 
proposed phase shifters are introduced and simulated, and 
experimental results obtained from an interleaved CM 
boost PFC with the proposed two-phase shifter are 
presented to confirm the discussed features. In addition, 
simulated results of an interleaved CM boost PFC with a 
four-phase shifter are presented. 
II. ANALYSIS OF INTERLEAVING CONTROL SCHEMES
Interleaving control schemes (ICSs) can be classified as 
shown in Fig. 1. The interleaving control scheme shown in 
Fig. 1(a) shifts the turn-on signal to achieve interleaving 
operation, while the one shown in Fig.1 (b) is to shift the 
turn-off signal [8]-[9]. For converters operated in 
CCM/DCM condition, their operation period TS is kept 
constant. Therefore, it is easy to determine a shift interval 
(or phase). For example, 360°/n is determined for an 
n-phase application. 
For interleaved boost PFCs in CM operation, their 
inductor current waveforms IL0, IL1 and I’L1 are illustrated in 
Fig. 2, from which it can be seen that the operation periods 
are different. The interleaving signal can be generated from 
turn-on signal P1 or turn-off signal P2 by shifting these 
signals with T1/2 or T1’/2. For an interleaved CM boost 
converter, P2 is a better choice for the converter in the slave 
stage, since it only requires a zero voltage detector to 
generate turn-on signal to achieve ZVS. With P1, the CM 
boost converter in a salve stage may not turn on with ZVS 
since the interleaved signal may not occur while the 
drain-source voltage of its switch drops to zero. Since the 
operation periods are varying with time, we should assume 
that the difference between the adjacent two operation 
periods is negligible first, and then we can take the 
previous operation period to determine the present shift 
period. For high frequency operation, this assumption is 
feasible.

Mode 1 [t1~t2]: At t1, the voltage signal VCTX across CTX is
half of VCTS which represents the previous operation
interval t0~t1. In this interval, VCTS will drop to Vdc and VCTX
is decreasing.
Mode 2 [t2~t3]: CTS is charging by a constant current
source Idc and CTX is discharging by Idc. At t3 VCTX drops to
Vdc and output voltage of the comparator is pulled high, and
then an edge-pulse generator is used to generate interleaved
signal RESET1 with a narrow pulse but without effect on
turning-on operation of the switch in the slave stage. Since
CTS and CTX are charging and discharging by Idc, the time
interval between t1 and t2 is half of that between t0 and
t1.Output voltage of R-S latch (R-S) turns high.
Mode 3 [t3~t4]: Half VCTS is delivering to CTX and the
peak value of VCTS represents the time interval between t2
and t4 which is almost the same as the switching period
between t1 and t4. The next cycle is with the same operation
as that between t1 and t4.
Type II Phase Shifter
Fig. 7 shows a Type II two-phase shifter and its timing
diagram. Control signals MP1, MP2 and MP3 are generated
according to the falling edge of G0 and the frequency of the
control signals are 1/3 of the frequency of G0. The
operation modes of this phase shifter are described as
follows:
Mode 1 [t1~t3]: In this interval, C1 is charging by Idc, C2 is
discharging by 2Idc and C3 holds the peak value in the
previous time interval which represents the operation
interval of G0 between t0 and t1. At t2, VC1 is greater than
VC3/2 so that output voltage of CMP1 turns high and
RESET1 is generated by an edge-pulse generator. The time
interval between t1 and t2 is half of that between t0 and t1.
Mode 2 [t3~t5]: C2 is charging, C3 is discharging and C1
holds the peak value of VC1 which represents the time
interval between t1 and t3. At t4, VC2 is going to be greater
than VC1/2 so that interleaved signal RESET1 is generated.

Table II shows the estimation of the total silicon area (or
called layout area) for each type of phase shifter, which
shows that Type IV is a better choice for two-phase
applications. For n-phase applications, the estimated silicon
area AII of Type II is
AII = (2700n62700) (μm)2, (3)
and that of Type IV, AIV, is
AIV = (53800n35800) (μm)2, (4)
where n is the number of phases. Therefore, silicon area of
a Type II phase shifter is smaller than that of Type IV while
n > 2.9, according to (3) and (4). In other words, the Type II
phase shifter is a better choice for applications with three or
more phases.
To verify the feasibility of the proposed phase shifter,
interleaved CM boost PFCs with the following
specifications were simulated and implemented:
 No. of phases: 2 (180° phase shift) and 4 (90°, 180° and 270°
phase shift)
 Operation frequency: 30 kHz ~ 300 kHz
 Input voltage: Vin = 110 Vrms
 Output voltage: Vout = 400 Vdc
 Total output power: Po = 320 W (2-phase) and 640 W (4-phase)
 Output capacitor: Cdc = 220 μF
The simulated results are shown in Figs. 11~16. Fig. 11
shows inductor currents IL0 and IL1, and gate signals G0 and
G1 of the interleaved PFC with a Type II phase shifter. It
can be observed that there is almost 180° phase shift
between G0 and G1. From Fig. 12, it can be observed that
the two switches are turned on with ZVS. Fig. 13 shows
input voltage Vin, input current Iin and output voltage Vout of
the PFC with output power PO = 320 W.
Fig. 14 shows inductor currents IL0 ~ IL3, and gate signals
G0 ~ G3 of the interleaved PFC with a Type II phase shifter.
It can be observed that there is almost 90° phase shift
between adjacent phases. From Fig. 15, it can be observed
that the four switches are turned on with ZVS. Fig. 16
shows Vin, Iin and Vout of the PFC with PO = 640 W. From
Figs. 13 and 16, it can be observed that input current ripple
of a 4-phase interleaved boost PFC is smaller than that of a
2-phase one.
