equivalent to the transmitted code sequence may
not exist. Nevertheless, the error performance can
be improved if noncoherently-equivalent code se-
quences corresponding to diﬀerent data bits can be
avoided, i.e., the code becomes noncoherently non-
catastrophic.
Because codes in [7] are not bandwidth eﬃcient,
we proposed a novel bandwidth-eﬃcient noncoher-
ently non-catastrophic trellis-coded MPSK scheme
in [16]. In this scheme, an Ungerboeck-type trellis-
coded MPSK is used, and a particular diﬀerential
encoder is added in front of the trellis encoder. Sim-
ulation results indicate that the error performance
of trellis-coded MPSK in [1]-[3] using noncoherent
decoding is not too bad, and its error performance
can be improved by inserting the proposed diﬀeren-
tial encoder.
In this project, we propose a general noncoher-
ently non-catastrophic TCM scheme, in which the
transmitter consists of a diﬀerential encoder, a ro-
tator, an inverse signal mapper, a convolutional en-
coder and a signal mapper. The signal mapper and
the properties of the convolutional encoder in the
proposed scheme are the same as those in coher-
ent TCM in [1]-[3], so TCM of the proposed scheme
has the same code sequences as coherent TCM in
[1]-[3] if they have the same convolutional encoder.
However, in the proposed scheme, adding the dif-
ferential encoder, the rotator and the inverse sig-
nal mapper changes the mapping from data bits
to code sequences. We show that in the proposed
scheme, as long as four assumptions are satisﬁed, all
noncoherently-equivalent code sequences correspond
to the same data bits so that the code is noncoher-
ently non-catastrophic.
The noncoherent trellis-coded MPSK scheme in
[16] is an example of the proposed scheme. For
the QAM scheme, a diﬀerential encoder which sat-
isﬁes the assumption is proposed. With this dif-
ferential encoder, the procedures for the transmit-
ter and the receiver can be simpliﬁed. We ﬁnd
that in some codes of trellis-coded QAM in [1]-[3]
(for example, 8-state and 16-state codes), for any
transmitted code sequence, there is always at least
one code sequence with diﬀerent data bits which
is noncoherently-equivalent to the transmitted code
sequence. Therefore, their error performance for
noncoherent decoding is poor. Simulation results
show that for noncoherent decoding, the proposed
noncoherently non-catastrophic QAM oﬀer signiﬁ-
cant gain over trellis-coded QAM in [1]-[3]. In addi-
tion, new trellis codes of the proposed scheme which,
for noncoherent decoding with a ﬁxed observation
length, have better bit error rates than Ungerboeck’s
codes are found by computer searches.
For bandwidth-eﬃcient modulation, QAM is the
best modulation for coherent systems. For the
noncoherent receiver with large observation length,
QAM is also appropriate since the error performance
is close to the coherent receiver. But for the nonco-
herent receiver with small observation length, maybe
QAM is not suitable.
三、 結果與討論
Consider trellis coded signals which are transmit-
ted over the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
channel. The transmitted baseband symbol at time
t is denoted by xt, and the corresponding baseband
symbol at the receiver is given by
rt = xte
jθt + nt (1)
where nt is a zero-mean white complex Gaussian
noise sample at time t and θt is an unknown phase
at time t.
Figure 1 shows the block diagram of the proposed
transmitter which consists of a diﬀerential encoder,
a rotator, an inverse signal mapper, a convolutional
encoder, and a signal mapper. Notice that coher-
ent TCM consists of a convolutional encoder and
a signal mapper only. If vt0 is a constant for all t,
the code sequence becomes an uncoded sequence.
For uncoded modulation, diﬀerential encoding can
let noncoherently-equivalent sequences correspond
to the same data bits, so it is straightforward to
put a diﬀerential encoder before the signal mapper.
But in fact the value of vt0 may change at diﬀerent
t, which results in a rotation of the output symbol
(this point will be explained later). Therefore, a
symbol rotator should be put after the diﬀerential
encoder to compensate for the rotation due to cod-
ing, and an inverse signal mapper is also necessary
to change the output of the rotator from a symbol
to bits. They are described as follows.
Signal mapper: The signal set consisting of
M = 2m+1 signal points is denoted by A0, and its
1 implies that rotating B0 by 2ψ is still B0, so yt is
always in B0.
Diﬀerential encoder: The task of the diﬀer-
ential encoder is to diﬀerentially encode data bits
ut1, · · · , utm to generate the output symbol in B0,
zt, according to the feedback symbol yt−1. Note
that in this diﬀerential encoder at time t, yt−1 is
feedback instead of zt−1. Represent zt by zt =
D(yt−1, ut1, · · · , utm). The diﬀerential encoder and
its correspond diﬀerential decoder should satisfy the
following assumption.
Assumption 4: Rotating (yt−1, zt) by any value of
θ does not aﬀect the output of the diﬀerential de-
coder at time t. In other words, ∀yt−1 ∈ B0 and
∀yt−1ejθ ∈ B0, if D(yt−1, ut1, · · · , utm) = zt, then
D(yt−1ejθ, ut1, · · · , utm) = ztejθ, where D denotes the
function of diﬀerential encoding.
Inverse signal mapper: The inverse signal
mapper is the inverse function of the signal mapper
of B0, with the same labeling used in the signal map-
per. In other words, the output bits of the inverse
signal mapper, vt1, · · · , vtm, is obtained according to
ω(0, vt1, · · · , vtm) = yt.
The procedure for the transmitter at time t > 0
is illustrated as follows. The initial value of v0t , v
0
0 ,
is set to be 0, and y0 can be any symbol in B0. The
symbol x0 = y0 is transmitted at time 0. The rate
loss due to the initial symbol x0 is negligible if the
transmitted sequence is long enough.
Step 1 Data bits ut1, · · · , utm and yt−1 are sent into
the diﬀerential encoder to output the symbol
zt ∈ B0.
Step 2 Using the feedback of vt0 and v
t−1
0 , rotate zt
by 2ψ or not according to (2).
Step 3 For the output symbol of the rotator yt ∈
B0, obtain the labeling bits vt1, · · · , vtm.
Step 4 Generate the transmitted symbol xt =
ω(vt0, v
t
1, · · · , vtm). Equivalently, xt is deter-
mined according to yt and v
t
0 by
xt =
{
yt if v
t
0 = 0
yte
jψ if vt0 = 1
. (3)
Step 5 In the trellis encoder, use inputs bits
vt1, · · · , vtm and the current state (at time t) to
move into the next state (at time t+1) and thus
the value of vt+10 is obtained and fed back to the
rotator.
Theorem 1: Trellis codes of the proposed scheme
are noncoherently non-catastrophic.
Proof: Let (x0, x1, · · · , xN) and (x′0, x′1, · · · , x′N)
denote any two noncoherently-equivalent code se-
quences. Consequently, there exists a constant θ
such that
(x′t−1, x
′
t) = (xt−1, xt)e
jθ (4)
for 0 < t ≤ N . Based on (4), we show that (x′t−1, x′t)
and (xt−1, xt) correspond to the same data bits in the
following.
For 0 ≤ t ≤ N , let (vt0, vt1, · · · , vtm), yt, zt and
(ut1, · · · , utm) correspond to xt, and (vt′0 , vt′1 , · · · , vt′m),
y′t, z
′
t and (u
t′
1 , · · · , ut′m) correspond to x′t. Con-
sider the following cases classiﬁed by (vt−10 , v
t
0) and
(vt−1′0 , v
t′
0 ).
(i) Suppose that (vt−1′0 , v
t′
0 ) = (0, 0) and
(vt−10 , v
t
0) = (0, 0). We have (y
′
t−1, y
′
t) = (yt−1, yt)e
jθ
by (3), and thus (y′t−1, z
′
t) = (yt−1, zt)e
jθ by (2). Ac-
cording to Assumption 4, we have (ut1, · · · , utm) =
(ut′1 , · · · , ut′m).
(ii) Suppose that (vt−1′0 , v
t′
0 ) = (1, 1) and
(vt−10 , v
t
0) = (1, 1). We have (y
′
t−1, y
′
t)e
jψ =
(yt−1, yt)ej(θ+ψ) by (3), and thus (y′t−1, y
′
t) =
(yt−1, yt)ejθ. Similar to (i), we have (ut1, · · · , utm) =
(ut′1 , · · · , ut′m).
(iii) Suppose that (vt−1′0 , v
t′
0 ) = (0, 0) and
(vt−10 , v
t
0) = (1, 1). We have (y
′
t−1, y
′
t) =
(yt−1, yt)ej(θ+ψ) by (3), and thus (y′t−1, z
′
t) =
(yt−1, zt)ej(θ+ψ) by (2). According to Assumption 4,
we have (ut1, · · · , utm) = (ut′1 , · · · , ut′m). The case of
(vt−1′0 , v
t′
0 ) = (1, 1) and (v
t−1
0 , v
t
0) = (0, 0) is similar.
(iv) Suppose that (vt−1′0 , v
t′
0 ) = (0, 1) and
(vt−10 , v
t
0) = (0, 1). We have (y
′
t−1, y
′
te
jψ) =
(yt−1, ytejψ)ejθ by (3), and thus (y′t−1, y
′
t) =
(yt−1, yt)ejθ. Similar to (i), we have (ut1, · · · , utm) =
(ut′1 , · · · , ut′m). The case of (vt−1′0 , vt′0 ) = (1, 0) and
(vt−10 , v
t
0) = (1, 0) is similar.
(v) Suppose that (vt−1′0 , v
t′
0 ) = (0, 1) and
(vt−10 , v
t
0) = (1, 0). We have (y
′
t−1, y
′
te
jψ) =
(yt−1ejψ, yt)ejθ by (3), and thus (y′t−1, z
′
te
jψ) =
(yt−1ejψ, ztej2ψ)ejθ = (yt−1, ztejψ)ej(θ+ψ) by (2). Ac-
cording to Assumption 4, we have (ut1, · · · , utm) =
(ut′1 , · · · , ut′m). The case of (vt−1′0 , vt′0 ) = (1, 0) and
(vt−10 , v
t
0) = (0, 1) is similar.

Figure 6: Labeling of noncoherent trellis-coded
32QAM (a) for the signal mapper in Fig. 1 (b) for
the bitwise diﬀerential encoder in Fig. 4.
For QAM, the values of ψ satisfying Assumption
1 are ψ = ±π
2
. The values of φ in Assumption 2 are
either φ = 0, π, or φ = a, π − a where 0 < a < π
2
.
The value of a is 53.1◦ for 16QAM, and 28.1◦, 53.1◦
and 67.4◦ for 32QAM. Assumption 2 is always true
due to φ + ψ = ±π
2
(in B1) or a± π
2
(not in A0).
The block diagram of the diﬀerential encoder is
presented in Fig. 4, which consists of a bitwise dif-
ferential encoder, a signal mapper, and an inverse
signal mapper. The signal mapper used in the diﬀer-
ential encoding, denoted by ωD, is diﬀerent from the
signal mapper ω in Fig. 1. For the signal mapper at
time t, the input bits are denoted by dt1, d
t
2, · · · , dtm
and the output symbol is zt = ωD(d
t
1, d
t
2, · · · , dtm).
For 2m symbols in B0, there are 2m−1 symbol pairs,
say (z, z′), satisfying z = −z′. Two symbols of each
pair are assigned the same values of d2, · · · , dm and
diﬀerent value of d1. Figure 5 and Figure 6 show the
labeling of the signal mapper which generates xt in
Fig. 1 and the labeling of the diﬀerential encoder,
for 16QAM and 32QAM respectively.
At time t, according to dt−11 , · · · , dt−1m which is ob-
tained by yt−1 = ωD(dt′1 , d
t′
2 , · · · , dt′m) and ut1, · · · , utm,
the proposed bitwise diﬀerential encoder generates
output bits dt1, d
t
2, · · · , dtm by
dti = d
t−1
i ⊕ uti (5)
for i ∈ {1, 2, · · · , m}.
Theorem 2: The proposed diﬀerential encoder de-
scribed above satisﬁes Assumption 4.
Proof: Let (ut1, · · · , utm, yt−1, zt) and
(ut′1 , · · · , ut′m, y′t−1, z′t) denote two input-output
groups satisfying (y′t−1, z
′
t) = (yt−1, zt)e
jθ. Consider
the following two cases.
(i) Suppose that θ = π. Note that y′t−1 = −yt−1
means dt−11 = d
t−1′
1 ⊕ 1 and dt−1i = dt−1′i ∀i =
2, · · · , m, and z′t = −zt means dt1 = dt′1 ⊕ 1 and
dti = d
t′
i ∀i = 2, · · · , m. Therefore, ut1 = dt1 ⊕ dt−11 =
dt′1 ⊕ dt−1′1 = ut′1 and uti = ut′i ∀i = 2, · · · , m.
(ii) Suppose that θ = π. It can be observed that
if rotating two symbols y and z in B0 by the same
value of θ = π are also symbols in B0, then y and
z must satisfy y = −z. Hence, we have zt = −yt−1
and z′t = −y′t−1. zt = −yt−1 implies dt1 = dt−11 ⊕
1 and dti = d
t−1
i ∀i = 2, · · · , m, and z′t = −y′t−1
implies dt′1 = d
t−1′
1 ⊕ 1 and dt′i = dt−1′i ∀i = 2, · · · , m.
Therefore, ut1 = d
t
1⊕ dt−11 = 1 = dt′1 ⊕ dt−1′1 = ut′1 and
uti = d
t
i ⊕ dt−1i = 0 = dt′i ⊕ dt−1′i = ut′i ∀i = 2, · · · , m.
By combining conditions (i) and (ii), we prove
that (y′t−1, z
′
t) and (yt−1, zt) correspond to the same
data bits ut1, · · · , utm. Therefore, Assumption 4 is
true for this diﬀerential encoder. 
For the proposed diﬀerential encoder, rotating
2ψ = π is equivalent to changing the value of d1.
Therefore, using the proposed diﬀerential encoder,
the ﬁrst three steps in the procedure for the trans-
mitter can be simpliﬁed as the following two steps.
Step 1 Diﬀerentially encode data bits uti by d
t
1 ={
dt−11 ⊕ ut1 ⊕ 1 if (vt−10 , vt0) = (1, 0)
dt−11 ⊕ ut1 otherwise
and by
dti = d
t−1
i ⊕ uti for i ∈ {2, · · · , m}.
Step 2 Obtain the bits vt1, · · · , vtm by
ω(0, vt1, · · · , vtm) = ωD(dt1, · · · , dtm). This
can be implemented by a look-up table.
Similarly, the procedure for the receiver can be sim-
pliﬁed as follows.
Step 1 The received symbol rt+λ−1 is sent into the
Viterbi decoder for TCM, and then the esti-
mate of bits vt1, · · · , vtm, denoted by vˆt1, · · · , vˆtm,
is generated. The bits dˆt1, · · · , dˆtm is obained by
ωD(dˆ
t
1, · · · , dˆtm) = ω(0, vˆt1, · · · , vˆtm) which can
also be implemented by a look-up table.
Step 2 The decoded data bits
uˆt1, · · · , uˆtm are obtained by uˆt1 ={
dˆt−11 ⊕ dˆt1 ⊕ 1 if (vˆt−10 , vˆt0) = (1, 0)
dˆt−11 ⊕ dˆt1 otherwise
and
uˆti = dˆ
t−1
i ⊕ dˆti for i ∈ {2, · · · , m}.

Figure 9: Performance comparison of trellis-coded
32QAM.
16QAM with L = 4 and L = 8 are (10, 22, 20, 37)
and (00, 14, 06, 37), respectively. It is observed that
the original Ungerboeck’s trellis-coded QAM has
very bad performance at low and medium SNRs.
In fact, the curves with high bit error rates are not
smooth due to their unstable decoding results. We
ﬁnd that in these codes, for any transmitted code
sequence, there is always at least one code sequence
with diﬀerent data bits which is noncoherently-
equivalent to the transmitted code sequence. For
the same Ungerboeck’s systematic convolutional en-
coder, using the proposed scheme can signiﬁcantly
improve the error performance with the price of ad-
ditional little complexity. In addition, using the
searched trellis-coded 16QAM can further enhance
the coding gain.
Then we compare the proposed TCM using the
searched code with the training-based coherent
TCM using Ungerboeck’s code. Assume that {θt}
is a random-walk process as used in [12]-[14] by
θt = θt−1 + ψt where {ψt} is a zero-mean white real
Gaussian random process with variance σ2ψ. In the
training-based coherent TCM scheme, the transmit-
ter inserts one pilot symbol of optimal energy (found
by simulations) every Nd coded symbols, and the re-
ceiver uses the pilot symbol to estimate θt and use it
as if it were true for the “coherent” decoding to cal-
culate the metrics of the following Nd symbols. Sim-

bol multiplied by 2.55 and 2.45, respectively. Notice
that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is expressed by
Eb/N0, and the SNR loss due to the insertion of pi-
