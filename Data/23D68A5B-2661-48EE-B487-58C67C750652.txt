investigated for a long time. Further research 
is therefore needed. In this presentation, we 
report the quantitative analysis results of the 
compositional dependent oxidation of Cu-Au 
alloy nanoparticles. This work can provide 
fundamental understanding of Cu-Au nano- 
particular system.  
 
Experimental 
The Cu-Au alloyed nanoparticles with 
10 at. % and 40 at. % Au were generated by 
vapor condensation method from a high 
purity Cu-Au ingot with purified helium in a 
vacuum chamber. The generated nano- 
particles were immediately carried with a 
helium flow through a stainless tube and 
deposited on an MgO (100) substrate (298 K) 
placed in another vacuum (specimen) 
chamber for grazing incident x-ray XRD 
measurements. Further details of the XRD 
performance have been described elsewhere 
[1]. The Au concentration of the prepared 
specimens was respectively estimated to be 
10 and 40 at. % from the Cu-Au (111) Bragg 
angle which is very sensitive to the Cu-Au 
composition due to the large difference in 
radius between Cu and Au atom [2]. For the 
oxidation experiments, dry air was 
introduced into the XRD chamber with 
keeping a pressure at 9.3×104 Pa and a 
substrate temperature at 298 K. During the 
oxidation, the XRD measurement was 
performed at 45 kV and 300 mA repeatedly 
once per hour until the intensity of the peaks 
showed practically no more change. After dry 
air exposing, the specimen was then rapidly 
transferred from the XRD chamber to XPS 
chamber via atmosphere air within 1 minute. 
The XPS measurement was performed in 
ultra-high vacuum (~10-9 Torr) and the 
accuracy of the electron analyzer is 0.1 eV. 
The Au 4f7/2 binding energy of high purity 
gold was used as an external standard. The 
deconvolution of the photoelectron peaks 
was fitted using XPSPEAK4.1 software. The 
Shirley background [3], and mixed Gaussian/ 
Lorentzian functions were used for the fitting. 
To see morphology and size distribution, 
Cu-Au nanoparticles were deposited on a 
holey carbon microgrid and transferred 
through air to a 200 kV transmission electron 
microscope (TEM), JEOL JEM-2010. 
 
Results and discussion 
Figure 1 shows the size distribution and 
the TEM micrograph of some deposited 
particles. The particles prepared by the 
present method frequently show icosahedral 
structure and have a size distribution from 5 
to 36 nm with a volume-mean size of 20 nm. 
The particles stacked in a rather porous 
fashion. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) 
surface area showed 15 m2g-1, indicating 55 
% reduction from the isolated state.

Figure 2 shows the x-ray diffraction 
patterns of (a) pure Cu, (b) Cu-10 at. % Au 
and (c) Cu-40 at. % Au nanoparticles before 
and after exposing to dry air. As can be seen, 
the XRD patterns of the as-deposited Cu and 
Cu-Au nanoparticles contain only a pair of 
diffracted peaks which correspond to Cu 
(111)/Cu(200) and Cu-Au(111)/Cu-Au(200), 
respectively. As well known, Cu has three 
typical oxides, i.e. Cu2O, CuO and Cu(OH)2. 
Depending on the experimental conditions, 
the surface oxide formed on Cu can consist 
of one or more species of the typical oxides. 
Our previous results [1] have indicated that 
Cu2O is the only preferred oxide for the Cu 
nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 2(a). In Fig. 
2(b), a broadening peak at 2θ =36.4o can be 
indexed as the Cu2O indicating the selective 
oxidation of the Cu component in the Cu-10 
at. % Au particles. This selective oxidation 
will produce an Au-rich phase in the original 
Cu-Au alloy, so call the dealloying process. 
Since only little amount of Cu was oxidized 
 4
Cu-40 at. % Au is Cu2O and CuO, 
respectively. We can also find the presence of 
Cu(OH)2 for both compositions. However, 
the comparable amount of Cu(OH)2 shown in 
Fig. 4 cannot be observed in the XRD 
patterns in Fig. 2 indicates the existence of 
amorphous Cu(OH)2.

Conclusions 
We have quantitatively observed the 
oxidation kinetics of Cu-Au nanoparticles 
and their compositional dependences. The 
oxidation behavior (protective or non- 
protective) was found to be directly related to 
the composition of Cu-Au nanoparticles. In 
addition, the XPS analysis showed the 
existence of Cu2O and Cu(OH)2 phases in the 
specimen of 10 at. % Au. Nevertheless, CuO 
and Cu(OH)2 phases were the main oxides in 
the specimen of 40 at. % Au. The present 
result might provide a valuable data for basic 
understanding of the self-limiting oxidation 
kinetics of metal nanoparticles and also for 
control of their oxide thickness.
