Abstract 
 
This paper presents a slot-coupled circularly polarized 
rectangular notch dielectric resonator antenna array 
fed by a microstrip line and power is come from a 
voltage control oscillator. Two buffer amplifiers are 
added for two antenna elements, individually. The 
active antenna power in the broadside radiation 
included the antenna gain, buffer amplifier gain, and 
VCO power, is near 17.3 dBm at the frequency of 
3.5GHz.  
 
Keywords: dielectric resonator antenna; DRA, 
wide-band, circularly polarization, 
antenna array, voltage control oscillator; 
VCO, and effective isotropic radiation 
power; EIRP. 
 
I、Introduction: 
 
Over the past years dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) 
[1-4] has become a trend of antenna design for its low 
loss, high efficiency, suitable size, and variable 
impedance bandwidth. In the design of the circularly 
polarized DRA, there exist several antenna 
configurations to result circular polarization 
performance. No matter what nearly-cubic DR for 
dielectric constant = 20 [1], the rectangular DRA with 
a specific length-to-width ratio [2], the cross-shaped 
DRA [3], and cross-aperture coupled DRA [4], there 
seems almost all single fed circularly polarized DRAs 
have 1~4 % 3dB axial ratio bandwidth in the 
measurement. Generally, the bandwidth for 3 dB axial 
ratio in the simulation data is less than that of the 
measured results. So, we can estimate the actually 
measured axial ratio bandwidth is better than the 
simulated data.  
,  
The notch DRA [5] owns a wide band performance 
due to the equivalent low Q value (mixing the DR and 
air). Hence, if it can extend to apply a circularly 
polarized antenna, we hope to achieve a wide 3dB 
axial ratio bandwidth. In this paper, a notch dielectric 
resonator is adopted as the radiator, microstrip line is 
used as the feeding line, and the tilted slot is utilized 
as the coupler. In such configuration, the experimental 
results explain that it really has a wider impedance 
bandwidth and a wider 3dB axial ratio bandwidth. 
Additionally, the antenna gain is higher to be about 7 
dBic in the broadside direction.  
 
The second year, we propose a single active antenna 
element. The antenna part is finished both simulated 
and experimental results. The VCO part is realized in 
this year. Also, the combination of antenna and VCO 
is carried out. The results of such active type antenna 
seem good in the power, harmonics, and other 
parameters. 
 
The third year, two antenna elements are studied. In 
order to obtain high EIRP, power amplifiers are added 
to the input of antennas to compensate for the 
transmission loss of feeding line. Therefore, three 
basic components are designed. One is antenna 
element, second is VCO element, and third is 
amplifier. Two antenna elements are arranged in the y 
direction to sum the antenna pattern.
