throughput, as well as compatibility with current 
CMOS process technology. Furthermore, experimental 
results will also be optimized through systematic 
experiment design. 
 Electron beam lithography (E-beam) and extreme 
ultraviolet lithography (EUV) are both considered as 
the most potential solutions for next generation 
lithography. In this study, feature size below 100nm 
was first defined by E-beam lithography. After metal 
deposition, silicidation process was applied to gap 
size. Besides, in the past, it have been existing 
some optimization methods proposed for typical 
semiconductor processes. But the optimization of 
nanogap fabrication is rarely discussed in the 
previous studies. Therefore, Taguchi method combined 
with back propagation neural network and modified 
particle swarm optimization algorithm was conducted 
to further reduce the nanogap size. The proposed 
method for nanogap fabrication is of great potential 
for future molecular or biosensor applications.

近年來，生物感測元件的應用廣泛，「奈米間隙」為其重要組件之一。之前「奈米間

影製程或者搭配其他方法為主，但製程穩定性鮮少有人探討。此外，在這些方法中都存在
著一些缺點，導致「奈米間隙」沒有一個主流製作方法。鑒於此，本研究計劃將以創新的
方法發展「奈米間隙」，強調以一個簡單的方法，同時具備尺寸小、合理的產能、並且能
與目前 COMS 技術結合等優勢來製作新式「奈米間隙」，並且以最佳化方法作更有系統性
的實驗規劃。

Introduction 
In the past decades, numerous nanogap fabrication techniques have been developed for the 
practical applications. The techniques for the fabrication nanostructure have been of great of 
interest for increasing the device density, reducing the power consumption and reducing the 
dimension of nanogap. Generally speaking, the nanogaps fabrication is mainly formed by two 
nano electrodes via electron-beam lithography. It has been numerous approaches applied to 
reduce the nanogaps, uniform the edge roughness and be compatible with the current CMOS 
technique. However, there are some drawbacks of electron-beam lithography, such as low 
throughput and high production cost. Hashioka et al. put more emphasis with fabricating metal 
nanogap devices of sub-50 nm size utilizing current photolighography and anodic oxidation [1]. 
The gap width of metal nanogap devices can be easily and accurately controlled by the applied 
voltage of the anodic oxidation process. Another method is used electron-beam lithography 
followed by double-angle evaporation of thin metallic films. By simply changing the film thickness, 
one can adjust the separation of the electrodes. In this method, error is caused mainly by the 
granularity of the deposited metals. We have observed the Coulomb blockade effect of 20 nm Au 
colloidal particles captured in a gap fabricated using this method [2]. Boussaad and Tao described a 
method to fabricate atomic-scale gaps and contacts between two metal electrodes. The method used 
a directional electrodeposition process and had a built-in self-termination mechanism. The final gap 
width and contact size were preset by an external resistor (Rext) that is connected in series to one of 
the electrodes [3]. Park et al. presented a simple yet highly reproducible method to fabricate 
metallic electrodes with nanometer separation. The fabrication was achieved by passing a large 
electrical current through a gold nanowire defined by electron-beam lithography and shadow 
evaporation. These electrodes were ideally suited for electron transport studies of chemically 
synthesized nanostructures, and their utility was demonstrated here by fabricating single electron 
transistors based on colloidal cadmium selenide nanocrystals [4]. Spelthahn et al. presented a 
simple method for the fabrication of self-aligned nanogaps and fluidic nanochannels by using 
conventional photolithography combined with patterned-size reduction technique. The method was 
based on the complete conversion of a photolithographically microstructured metal layer – 
exhibiting a high expansion coefficient – to a metal oxide with an improved pattern size resolution 
using thermal oxidation. With this technique, there are no principal limitations to fabricate 
nanostructures with different layouts down to several nanometer dimensions. In this reference, the 
proposed method was experimentally demonstrated by preparing self-aligned nanogaps and 
nanochannels on a Si–SiO2 substrate down to 15–20nm dimensions [5]. In our study, the proposed 
method is demonstrated by combining the Taguchi experimental design with self-aligned nanogaps 
fabrication to reduce nanogaps via a high expansion coefficient metal.

The procedure for fabricating nanogap electrode is shown in Fig. 1. The first step for manufacturing 
nanogap electrode is to sandwich a p-type Si (100) wafer (phoenix, San Jose, CA) with a 2000 A

The SiO2 film with a thickness of 30/50/70 nm is grown on CVD (chemical vapor deposition). The 
resist used for the thermal-flow process is ZEP520 from Nippon Zeon. ZEP520 is a high resolution 
electron-beam resist suitable for nanogaps fabrication. Electron-beam exposure is carried out by 
using Elionix ELS-7500 e-beam writer to form the initial nanogap patterns in the resist layer. The 
developer used for ZEP520 after the exposure process is N50 which is also from Nippon Zeon. 
After development, the substrates are baked under different conditions of temperature and time 
period as listed in Table 1 in order to further shrink the diameter of the initial nanogap. The nanogap 
is measured by Hitachi S-6280H in-line SEM (scanning electron microscopy) for quick and 
accurate nanogap measurement. In L18 orthogonal array (OA), it also means that 18 different 
experiment combinations and 18 different process parameter settings are existed. The experiment 
replication for each combination is three times. Therefore, the experiments are conducted and 
obtained 18*3=54 measurements for the succeeding analysis. The fundamental principle in robust 
design is to improve quality by minimizing the variation. One two-level parameter (Factor A) and 
four three-level (Factor B~E) are considered in this study. The interaction effect between the 
process parameters is not considered. All of the computations and plots are conducted by Minitab 
statistical software, Minitab Inc.. Taguchi method includes smaller-the-better (SB), nominal-is-best

Given a CI (confidence interval) of 95% for the nanogaps dimension, the CI is computed to be 
1.068 (dB) and confidence interval is -29.85 ± 1.068 = (-28.782, -30.918). The confirmation result 
is -29.73 (dB) that the optimizations of the lithograph process nanogaps reduction is achieved.  
Conclusion 
The novel nanogaps fabrication using Taguchi method and modified PSO for application in high 
resolution lithography is characterized. The nanogaps reduction via metal layer expansion technique 
for nanogaps fabrication is established. The optimal parameter settings are determined by SNRs, 
ANOVA and modified PSO methods. Many factors influencing nanogaps reduction and metal 
expansion performance, such as metal type, SiO2 thickness, temperature, time and initial electrode 
gaps are discussed and optimized. Initial electrode gaps are the most important factor affecting the 
nanogaps reduction and metal type is the second important factor to affect the final scheme and 
nanogaps dimension.
