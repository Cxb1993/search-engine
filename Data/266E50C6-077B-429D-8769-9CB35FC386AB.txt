1. Introduction 
The micropyretic synthesis wave is known to propagate in steady or unsteady modes 
[1-8].  Several different types of oscillations are known to occur during micropyretic 
synthesis when staring from solid powder compacts [1-8].  Spiral or spinning combustion 
front instabilities have been observed [1-8] for micropyretic synthesis.  All such instabilities 
(bifurcations) including spiral bifurcations are thought to arise primarily because of a high 
Lewis number [3] or initiated by a BZ reaction [6-8].  A typical micropyretic synthesis 
experiment comprises the main steps of igniting (starting) the reaction at one end of a reactant 
mix (e.g., in a pressed powder green compact, typically of micro size particles) [5-8].  A 
glowing reaction front then proceeds through the specimen at velocities of the order of 1 – 103 
mm/s yielding a desired product in a shaped form.  The initial conditions for synthesis have 
been recognized as strongly influencing the instabilities [6-8].  This is however typical of all 
non-linear reactions.  The final microstructure appears to be particularly sensitive to starting 
particle size and initial temperature [5,9-41].  Unusually, high values for engineering 
properties have been reported in near-net shaped objects manufactured by the micropyretic 
synthesis route [5,36,37,42-44].  Thus, micropyretic synthesis offers the possibility for 
obtaining NiAl alloys containing nano-features, by net-shape bulk processing routes and has 
significant technical advantages from both a processing and improved material view point 
[3,5,13,45-48].  Several in-situ studies with X-ray synchrotron have indicated the possibility 
of oscillating sub-reactions and significant changes in background noise during the synthesis 
of NiAl [see reference 6 for a summary].  However there are only two reports, one for NiAl 
[36] and the other for NiTi [49] that identify new phases and nano-features as being 
specifically associated with larger size starting powders compared to smaller size starting 
powders, i.e. with different reaction pathways [36,49].  
 
With changing particle size, the temperature profiles are very different with a change in 
the Ni particle size [50].  In addition, it has been reported that the differences in the particle 
size also lead to viscosity differences [51], i.e. it can impact short range order in liquid.  Thus 
particle size difference possibly results in the different temperature history or microstructures. 
Although X-ray analysis indicates that the final product is always NiAl [5,50,52], the 
microstructure is noted to change in morphology from dendritic to unsegregated grains 
containing fine nano bands when there is a lowering of the initial compact temperature, or the 
addition of small amounts of solute or an increase in the initial particle size prior to initiating the 
rapid reaction [36,53].  The fine bands within grains comprise of very fine nanostructure 
namely nano-particles and nano-bands [6].  These nano-features have been identified as 
arising from different pathways which sometime include Belousov-Zhabotinsky type of 
oscillations [6-8].  Unusually high frequency oscillatory states close to bifurcations points 
have been previously reported [54,55].  Far from equilibrium dissipative route microstructure 
formation and the unique properties that result from small variations from the initial conditions 
e.g., variations because of particle size distributions, pressure pulses, nucleation seed gradients, 
or surface energy conditions that lead to hierarchical structures in microstructures or 
2. Numerical Calculation 
The calculation of the entropy generated is facilitated by considering that at steady state 
where the reaction zone is fixed.  Although such an assumption is not entire valid, all the 
reported experimental and numerical results to date for the rapidly moving front [1-5,55] have 
indicated that such an assumption is not unreasonable.  Alternately one may perform 
quenching experiments [26,35,44] or rapid X-ray analysis [62-68] to determine the extent of 
reaction inside a front but because the reaction is heterogeneous and shows considerable 
bifurcations in reaction sequences with external conditions, there is no easy manner in which 
the interface temperature can be measured and correlated to the volume transformed.  With 
this assumption the rate of entropy production per unit volume or per mole, the generated rate 
of entropy (dSgen/dt) can be calculated for the rapidly reacting moving front system by 
tracking the temperature-time profiles at a given location as the front propagates through the 
region.  The amount of temperature increase reflects the total amount of irreversible entropy 
generated when assuming that the reaction is adiabatic.  The differences in entropy are noted 
because part of this was captured in reversible exchanges like melting, nano pore formation, 
vacancy formation, defect formation, and any other boundaries which are defects or any other 
disorder like lack of full order. 
 
The BZ sequence or other reactions are still unclear during the temperature increasing, 
however, what happens is a plateau can be used for an approximation for calculating entropy 
generated.  In addition, several thermal analyses has revealed the occurrence of plateau or 
kinks during the heating or cooling stage. [44,33,35,69-76].  Of course using an adiabatic 
approximation is also an approximation which reduces our count of total Sgen for the slower 
reactions and makes it feel like a lot of events happened.  Typically the thermocouple bead is 
about 1mm3 whereas the reaction volume is about 100 mm3 [69], thus, the measured 
temperature-time plot can be possibly used to calculate the various parameters in the reaction 
zone.  The overall entropy generation over the temperature interval (from reactant to product) 
can now be now approximately calculated as:  
 d(Sgen)/dt = dSreaction/dt + dSgradient /dt (1) 
 
During the entropy calculation by analyzing temperature-time plot, the Ni + Al 
reaction is divided into three stages according to the temperature profiles (Figure 1), including 
the melting point of Al (933K) to the plateau temperature (stage 1), plateau stage (stage 2), 
and from plateau temperature to the highest temperature (stage 3).  In stage 1, the 
combustion zone is assumed to be adiabatic and the propagation front is steady sate.  The 
rate of entropy generation is approximately calculated as: 
  d(Sgen)/dt = dSreaction/dt + dSgradient /dt  
temperature.

All the reaction was preheated to ~520K and then ignited.  The average Al particle size is 5μm and initial porosity 
is from 34% to 45%.  Stages 1 , 2, and 3 delegate the reactions from melting temperature of Al (933K) to plateau 
temperature (1912K (mp of NiAl) for paths 1 and 2 and 1725K (mp of Ni) for path 3), plateau temperature, from 
plateau temperature to the highest temperature, respectively.

* Assumed during the plateau which offset the heat release form the reaction during the plateau period.  The instant cooling rate 
was measured at the plateau temperature of cooling rate. 
 
Note from Table 1 that the reaction is first ignited and then increased to plateau 
temperature of 1912K for paths 1 and 2.  The reactions stand in plateau regions in 1.88 s and 
4.06 s for paths 1 and 2, then increase to the 1970K and 1966K, and finally cool down.  The 
cooling rate is noted to decrease to increase with the particle size.  Du et al. show that the 
thermal diffusivity decreases as nano structure of NiAl forms [77].  For us it corroborates 
with lower cooling rate in paths 2 and 3 which we associate with BZ.  From the cooling rate 
at the plateau temperature, the changes in the temperature can be corresponding calculated to 
be 210 K and 344.5 K, respectively.  The enthalpy generated in the plateau region is thus 
calculated to be 7742 Joule/mole and 5857 Joule /mole which are 11.01% and 8.86% of total 
generated enthalpy.  Similarly, the faction reacted and entropy can be calculated for path 3.  
After incorporating the entropy from the temperature gradient (Sgradient) in stage 1, the entropy 
generated in each stage can be acquired.  Note from Table 1 that the generated rate of 
 The Ni-Al micropyretic reaction is thermal explosion (furnace) mode is also studied to 
illustrate the effect of the entropy generated from the temperature gradient.  The Ni+Al 
micropyretic reactions with foils [69] and particles [50] are respectively synthesized in the 
thermal explosion mode in 973K and 1073K furnace, respectively.  Figure 2 shows the 
calculated values of entropy generation rate ( △d Sreaction/dt) and fraction reacted with 
temperature.  The generated entropy for reactions with the particles and foils are shown in 
Table 2.  Also show in the table for comparing is the wave propagation of the reaction with 
the similar Ni particle (path 2).  Note from Table 2 that the initial temperature for thermal 
explosion mode is higher than one in the wave propagation mode, thus the highest 
combustion temperature and corresponding enthalpy is enhanced as compared with the wave 
propagation mode.  The calculated enthalpy is thus noted to increase from 62-68 KJ/mole 
(wave propagation mode) to 76-79 KJ/mole (thermal explosion mode).  Average generated 
rate of entropy (d(Sgen)/dt) is slightly increased from 15.10 Joule/mole/K/s to 16.05 
Joule/mole/K/s when the reactions with particles change from the wave propagation mode 
(path 2) to the thermal explosion mode (path 5).  The Average generated rate of entropy 
(d(Sgen)/dt) is significantly decreased to 2.07 Joule/mole/K/s when the reactants are changed 
from the particle form to the foil.  Since there is no steady front movement and no 
temperature gradient, the total generated entropy for thermal explosion mode is decreased 
from 72-74 Joule/mole/K (wave propagation mode) to 64-67 Joule/mole/K.
