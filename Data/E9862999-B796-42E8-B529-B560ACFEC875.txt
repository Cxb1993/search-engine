一、 前言 
同軸噴注器普遍使用於以液態氫(LH2)/
液態氧(LOX)為推進劑的液態火箭上；其工
作原理為利用內管液體氧化劑噴流與外圍高
速燃料氣體的速度差所產生之剪力效應，造
成噴流表面破裂進而產生霧化液滴；其目的
為增加推進劑混合度及蒸發速率，並且提高
其容積釋熱率(Volumetric heat release rates)，
達到增加燃燒效率的效果[1]。 
影響同軸霧化現象的參數極多，如噴注
器的形式及結構設計、操作條件、環境壓力
以及工作流體本身物理性質等；其中像是液
體的黏滯性(viscosity)具有降低破碎速率及
穩定霧化效應(damping)的影響[2]；增加液/
氣間相對速度、環境壓力則能增強霧化現象
[3]，造成霧化角度擴張並減小霧化液滴尺
寸；通常在實驗分析時常整合所有參數，以
無因次參數進行討論，如利用雷諾數
(Reynolds number)、韋伯數(Webber number)
等對同軸霧化的現象進行分類[4]。 
同軸噴注器的設計對於液態火箭推進系
統是非常重要的環節，因為噴注器霧化的現
象控制著火焰的穩定性以及燃燒壁內的溫度
分布；因此過去的研究特別將霧化的現象特
徵化，如霧化角主要是表達霧化液滴的空間
分佈，其原理為液滴顆粒的慣性力(inertia)使
得液滴從液氣作用面的剪力邊界層脫離[5]；
而破碎距離則是代表液注噴流從噴注面到液
柱開始斷裂的距離，為設計燃燒室長度之重
要參考依據；而液滴粒徑分布則與影響著火
焰溫度的分布，主要是由韋伯數及相對速度
為最主要影響參數，其他如工作流體之密度
比、表面張力(surface tension)、黏滯力也會影
響粒徑分布的現象[6]。 
在 1940年代即開始研究以液態氫及液態
氧為推進劑組合的液態火箭，目前使用的如
美國的太空梭主引擎 (space shuttle main 
engine : SSME)、土星號的 F-1、歐洲亞利安
火箭的主引擎(Ariane 5, Vulcain engine)及俄
羅斯的 RD-180 火箭等；其優點為具極高的
比衝值(Isp)及無毒的特性，且主要推進器皆選
用同軸噴注器(coaxial injector)作霧化及混合
推進劑之用。 
國內因缺乏高推力液態火箭的實驗研
究，而國外這方面的文獻又列為機密取得不
易，因此本研究針對上述所提及的實驗參
數，設計多組不同內外孔徑(面積比)之同軸噴
注器與液/氣操作流速組合，以水/空氣為工作
流體在常壓下進行基礎冷流實驗觀察，透過
拍攝正面霧化影像、Malvern 粒徑量測以及
PLIF觀察霧化範圍等分析方式，建立基本霧

究分析，作為未來設計同軸噴注器及燃燒室
的參考依據。 
 
二、 實驗設計 
本研究以水及空氣為工作流體進行同軸
噴注器之霧化混合觀察實驗，其實驗設備由
同軸噴注器機構(圖 1)、液/氣體流量供應與控
制系統、正面霧化影像觀察設、PLIF光學量
測及擷取系統及 Malvern 粒徑分析儀所組
成。並以固定內管(1.4mm)搭配四組不同外管
孔徑之面積比(表一)，及液/氣體操作流速組
合(速度比)作為實驗參數(表二、三)，進行常
壓下冷流霧化觀測實驗。 
 
2.1 正面霧化影像觀察 
本實驗利用數位相機(D90)搭配變焦鏡頭
拍攝正面霧化流場影像(圖 1)，每次實驗皆固
定位置及拍攝條件；可得解析度為 4288*2848
之正面霧化影像，經由影像分析軟體
(Photoshop CS2) 進行去雜訊及背景值校正

到極限值時，多餘的氣體動力作用力並無法
幫助霧化角度的繼續擴張；而液體流速至 5、
7m/s 時(如圖 3)，由於相對速度增加量(與
3m/s相比)較小，其空氣動力作用力增加量減
少，造成其整體特徵霧化角較小；且由於氣
體流速並未達到操作條件下之極限值，其特
徵霧化角成長現象並未停止。 
 
3.2面積比對同軸噴流特徵霧化角之影
響 
由於本實驗所使用之內管直徑固定，因
此面積比之增加可視為外層氣層厚度增加；
在操作條件設定為三組液/氣流速組合，其速
度比皆為 20的操作條件下，實驗結果顯示(圖
4)，由於外圍未消耗之氣層仍有剩餘動能使
得霧化液滴包覆其中，且液滴的慣性力不足
以穿透過多餘氣層，其特徵霧化角隨面積比
(包覆氣層之厚度)增加而收縮；因此當設計燃
燒室時，就必須考量到面積比所帶來的影響。  
 
3-3 速度比對同軸噴流特徵霧化角之
影響 
從 3.1節知當液/氣相對速度不同時，會造
成特徵霧化角有所差異，為了整合各種液/氣
的速度組合對特徵霧化角的影響，本實驗利
用速度比作為分析參數，其定義為氣體流速
與液體流速之比值 Vg /Vl，綜合四組面積比
及多組流速組合的實驗結果顯示(如圖 5)，其
特徵霧化角隨速度比之變化之趨勢，主要可
分為兩個區域：(1) Vr < 20；此區域其特徵霧
化角與速度比的關係為高度正相關，特徵霧
化角隨速度比增加而提高，而面積比在此區
域對於霧化角角度影響較小，可推論為此區
域液/氣相對流速較低，其氣體動力作用力不
足以完全霧化，因此面積比增加的影響相對
來說較不顯著；可稱此區域為霧化成長區。
(2) Vr > 20；此區域其特徵霧化角隨速度比增
加而快速擴張，特徵霧化角呈現小幅度震
盪，是由於中心噴流流速不同(相對速度差異)
所造成之影響，且特徵霧化角隨面積比增加
其角度漸縮，則與 3.2 的結果相同，是由於
外圍未消耗之氣層仍有剩餘動能，使得霧化
液滴包覆其中且無法穿透多餘氣層，也因此
這區域中面積比的影響較為顯著；而當速度
比增加至 30時，呈現較平緩且穩定之狀態，
特徵霧化角已不隨速度比之增加而急劇變
化；可稱此區域為霧化穩定區。 
 
3.4 速度比對於特徵霧化角位置之
SMD粒徑分布之影響 
本研究在2.1節已定義特徵霧化角位置為
操作條件下霧化完全發展的參考位置，可作
為霧化比較的基準：因此SMD粒徑分布的實
驗設定面積比為3.45，分別使用速度比為
25(液體流速4m/s、氣體流速100m/s，A組)及
15(液體流速4m/s、氣體流速60m/s，B組)為
實驗參數，觀測各組特徵霧化角位置之SMD
粒徑分布分析；作為速度比對內部霧化程度
之比較，由實驗結果可知(如圖6)，A組的霧
化液滴SMD粒徑較大，且可量測之霧化範圍
僅為左右各0.5cm；而B組的霧化液滴SMD粒
徑較小，而可量測之霧化範圍為左右各
1.0cm，顯示較低的速度比，其氣體動力作用
力所造成的剪力效果較低，霧化液滴的SMD
粒徑較大，且粒徑分布較不平均，而當速度
比增加時，剪力效應造成霧化效果增加，霧
化液滴的SMD較小，粒徑分部呈現較平緩分
布的現象，且霧化範圍增加；因此可知相對
速度(速度比)對於霧化液滴SMD粒徑大小及
分布的具有強烈的影響。 
 
5 
 
近的霧化面積下才能進行比較，若霧化面積
差異過大，則P.I.值並無法作為霧化均勻程度
的比較；綜合分析兩組的比較結果，可得霧
化範圍及均勻度皆隨著速度比的增加而有增
加的趨勢，而面積比(氣層厚度)的增加，則會
造成霧化範圍的內縮及中心區域質量較為集
中的現象。 
 
四、 結論 
本論文以同軸霧化器之面積比及速度比
作為冷流實驗之參數，觀察噴流霧化之現
象。實驗結果顯示(1) 在常壓下，固定面積比
情況下，其特徵霧化角隨著氣體速度增加而
擴張；而面積比(氣層厚度)增加時，在相同操
作條件下，其特徵霧化角則隨氣層厚度增加
而收縮；另外，特徵霧化角隨速度比增加具
有明顯的段落分布趨勢；(2) 特徵霧化角位置
SMD粒徑分布在固定面積比情況下，增加速
度比時其霧化範圍內SMD粒徑減小，可量測
範圍及徑向方向上之SMD粒徑差異較小；而
當固定速度比情況下，增加面積比亦會造成
霧化範圍內SMD粒徑減小，SMD粒徑分布較
為平均但可量測霧化範圍則會減少，且面積
比的改變對於SMD粒徑大小改變幅度並不如
增加速度比之影響強烈；(3) 由整體霧化範圍
內之SMD粒徑分布顯示，發現其中心SMD粒
徑隨下游距離增加而下降，其SMD粒徑分佈
平均，因此呈現較為平緩之高斯分布現象。
(4) 由特徵霧化角位置之二維質量機率分布
結果，可知霧化面積及均勻度均隨著速度比
增加而增加(P.I.值下降)，而面積比(氣層厚度)
的增加，霧化面積收縮，其霧化液滴質量主
要集中於中心區域。

dynamic and hydrodynamic instabilities [7, 8], viscosity 
of the liquid which affects the jet’s hydrodynamic in-
stability is one of the crucial elements determining the 
starting velocity of fully-developed spray pattern. How-
ever, at fully-developed velocities, surface tension of 
the liquid which affects the aerodynamic instability is 
much more influential than viscosity on liquid atomiza-
tion.[9]   
In the investigation of droplet size distribution of 
impinging sprays, the SMD of droplets were observed 
to decrease with increasing jet velocity.[6] A phase 
Doppler particle analyzer (PDPA) was adopted to exam 
the doublet impinging water jets with various mass flow 
rates, the results showed that liquid flow rate crucially 
control the atomization of the impinging jets and a 
critical mass flow rate produced an optimum atomiza-
tion of the liquid jets.[10]  
For the fully-developed sprays, lateral motion of 
the droplets below the impinging point may occur and 
causes secondary collision and further liquid mixing.  
Especially in the dense spray system, the effect of drop-
let collision significantly alters the spray characteris-
tics.[11]  From the experimental observations, the out-
come of binary droplet-droplet collision was described 
by bouncing, coalescence, separation (reflective & 
stretching), and shattering from the differences of Web-
ber number (We) and impact parameter (b), etc.[12]  
For small values of Webber number and impact pa-
rameter, droplet coalescence was favored.  However, 
for large We and b, the collision resulted in either 
bouncing or temporary coalescence and eventual sepa-
ration with or without additional satellite droplet.[13]  
The outcome of binary collision between droplets was 
characterized into different regimes by b and We.[14] 
As was shown that the momentum rate of liquid 
jets significantly affected the impinging spray phenom-
ena [1-3, 10], this research investigated the mixing phe-
nomena of impinging jets. The mass distribution of the 
spray from individual impinging jets was detailed ana-
lyzed by Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) 
technique.[15-16]  Together with the information of the 
droplet size, the complex mechanism of the mixing of 
impinging jets was comprehended in depth. 
 
Experimental Apparatus and Techniques 
In this study, a nitrogen-compressing flow control 
system was used to accurately supply the liquid flow to 
the doublet impinging jet experiments (see Fig.1).  The 
injector was composed of two orifices of ψ0.3 mm 
(L/d 5) oriented to have a +30°/-30° impinging angle.  
With different surface tensions, water (σ~71.8 N/m) 
and acetone(10vol%)-water solution (σ~51.2 N/m) 
were adopted as the test liquids.  The physical proper-
ties of the test liquids are listed in Table 1.  For the ex-
periments, the momentum rate ratio of the impinging 
jets was kept unity, and the momentum rates were var-
ied from 900 2/ scmg   to 38000 2/ scmg  . 
The front-view and side-view snap-shot images of 
the sprays of doublet impinging jets were taken to ac-
quire the spray angle variations at different jet momen-
tum rates.  The scatter-light intensity probability distri-
bution of the images at 15mm downstream of the im-
pinging point were fitted by Gaussian function (see Fig. 
2), and, 85% of the total light intensity was used to de-
fined the width of the spray fan (w). Coupled with the 
distance (d) from impinging point and the impinging 
angle (θ), the spray angles were calculated by 
 
                       

 
d
w 2/tan2 1  (1) 
 
PLIF technique was adopted to observe the 2-D 
droplet mass distributions (see Fig. 3).  The 
1mm50mm laser sheet (532nm) from a second-
harmonic Nd-YAG laser (Model LOTIS TII) was 
aligned to cross the spray fan to excite the droplets con-
taining laser dye (Sulforhodamine 101). A 600nm high-
pass filter was used to attenuate the scattered laser light 
and the fluorescent images of the sprays were acquired 
with a pseudo-color synchronous CCD camera 
(1600×1200 pixels).  The shutter speed of the camera 
was 110 sec and the resolution of the image was 
0.05mm.  In each experiment, average of 100 fluores-
cent images was recorded for statistical analysis. Since 
the local fluorescent intensity of the images is linearly 
proportional to the local liquid mass [15-16], 2-D drop-
let mass density probability distributions was able to be 
constructed from the fluorescent images. As is shown in 
the right of Fig. 3, the constant probability contours of 
2-D droplet mass distribution was thus identified. 
The spray patternation index ( ..IP ) [17] and the 
mixing efficiency ( mE ) [1] were also evaluated in this 
study.  Patternation index (0~200) represents the uni-
formity of the spray distribution where zero of the ..IP  
is the most uniform state.  mE of 100% indicates the 
perfect mixing between two liquids.  In addition, pene-
tration percentage ( ..PP ) was also used to indicate the 
mass percentage of the spray from one impinged jet to 
cross the center line and penetrate to the other side as 
shown in Fig. 4.[18]  For like-doublet jets impinging 
sprays with the same orifice size and flow momentum 
rate, ..PP  of 50% would ideally result in the optimum 
mixing efficiency of 100%. 
Besides PLIF measurement, the mean droplet sizes 
( 32d ) distribution of the spray were measured by a 
Malvern Spraytec particle size analyzer. By incorporat-
ing 32d  distribution data with the mass probability dis-
 4
~7000 2/ scmg  .  At high momentum rates, 32d  of 
either test liquid approached a limiting size. 
 The mean relative lateral velocity is also estimated 
in order to calculate the Webber number of droplets.  
Since the observation position was close to the imping-
ing point, the aerodynamic effect on droplets was as-
sumed negligible, that is, the break up and atomization 
of the liquid jets consumed only the lateral (horizontal) 
momentum and lead the vertical velocity component of 
droplets unchanged. Thus, the lateral velocity ( x ) can 
be determined by 
 
d
x
jetx 


2
cos   (2) 
 
where jet  is the jet velocity,   is the impinging angle 
(60), x  is lateral distance to the impinging center line, 
and d is the downstream distance from impinging point. 
The weighted mean lateral velocity of the spray ( x ) 
was estimated by  
  xxmx P  ,  (3) 
 
where xmP ,  is the probability of mass distributed at the 
lateral position x , which was determined by the PLIF 
experimental results.  The calculated x  for both test 
solutions at different momentum rates are plotted in Fig. 
11.  The results showed that x  increased with increas-
ing momentum rates in the range of study, and the 
mean lateral Webber number of the droplets ( xWe ) 
considering only the lateral motion of the droplets in 
the spray was then calculated by 
 

 322dWe xx   (4) 
 
where   and   are the density and the surface tension 
of the test solution, respectively.  The results of the 
calculated  xWe  are shown in Fig. 12, which indicates 
xWe  increased almost linearly with increasing momen-
tum rates.  
Since droplet collisions obviously affect ..PP , the 
probability of droplet collision at the different momen-
tum rates are required to be estimated.  Consider a thin 
slice (1mm thick) of the spray fan located at 15mm 
downstream of the impinging point as the control vol-
ume, and defining pM  as the liquid mass of one (left) 
jet moving toward the other side (right) with droplet 
collision, then 
 
dp mtZM  )(  (5) 
 
where Z is the droplet collision rate, t  is the time for 
spray to travel through the control volume (V), and 
dm is the averaged droplet mass ( dm ).  The total colli-
sion number can be expressed as 
 
tvndtZ x 232  (6) 
 
where n  is the number density of the droplets in the 
control volume. So, equation (5) becomes

The distribution areas of droplets ( tA ) at 15mm 
downstream were estimated from the mass probability 
distributions from PLIF observations.  For different 
momentum rates, the observed tA   are shown in Fig. 13.  
The 32d  and x  in equation (8) were previously de-
fined.  Since d  is a fixed value of 1mm, with the 
same previous assumption that the vertical velocity of 
droplets is the same as the exit vertical velocity of liq-
uid jets, t  can be easily obtained for different mo-
mentum rate experiments. 
The calculated dimensionless term   dAtvd tx 232  at various momentum rates were 
proportional to the collision probability (P) of droplets 
and are plotted in Fig. 14. The results showed that the 
values of this dimensionless term for water impinge-
ments sharply decreased as the momentum rate increas-
ing to 15000 2/ scmg   and then almost invariant.   
With the analysis results of droplet’s Webber num-
bers and collision probabilities in sprays, the variation 
of ..PP with momentum rate shown in Fig.6 for water 
impingements can be interpreted as follows:   
  In the 1st stage (4000 2/ scmg  < m  
<7500 2/ scmg  ) of fully-developed conditions, the 
values of   dAtvd tx 232  for both water impinge-

Abstract 
In this research, the droplet size distributions in fully-developed like-doublet impinging sprays were analyzed by 
Malvern measurements in conjunction with the mass distribution information from Planar Laser Induced Fluores-
cence (PLIF) observations.  The impinging angle (+30°/-30°) was fixed, and the jet velocity (28.6m/s57.3m/s), 
surface tension (44.0 mN/m71.8 mN/m), orifice size (0.3mm and 0.4mm) and ambient pressure were varied to 
investigate their effects on droplet size distributions.  Fixed fraction of the liquid mass of the droplets near the cen-
terline region of the sprays was analyzed at different cross-section.  The results showed that the droplet sizes de-
creased with increasing jet velocities because of the higher hydrodynamic and aerodynamic instabilities.  Impinge-
ments with lower surface tension liquid produced smaller droplets near the impinging point, however, due to the 
coalescence of droplets by secondary collision, the droplet size increased and then decreased at the downstream due 
to aerodynamic instability. Viscosity of the liquid also showed a profound effect on the observed droplet sizes.  
Higher viscosity liquid produced larger droplets in the near- impinging point region for jet’s lower hydrodynamic 
instability.  However, in the downstream region from the impinging point, the change of viscosity and surface ten-
sion showed little effects on droplet size, that is, the jet’s velocity that crucially affecting the aerodynamic instability 
controlled the droplet size distribution of the impinging sprays

Introduction 
Doublet impinging jets design is generally used for 
atomization and mixing of the liquid propellants in low-
thrust rocket engines. While impinging, the liquid jets 
become highly hydrodynamic unstable and disintegrate 
instantaneously at fully developed conditions. There are 
several important parameters that significantly affect 
the impinging spray including jet velocity, ambient 
pressure, orifice size and arrangement, and physical 
properties of the liquid.  
In the early studies, Rupe [1,2] found that the mo-
mentum ratio and the diameter of the jets must be equal 
to achieve optimum impingement and mixing characte-
ristics. Four types of spray patterns were observed in 
both Heidmann[3] and Lai’s[4] studies. At a high 
enough jet velocity, the liquid jets break up and atomize 
immediately after impingement and was defined as ful-
ly-developed.  Since the aerodynamic and hydrodynam-
ic instabilities are the main effects causing liquid jet to 
breakup and atomize[5, 6],  Lai and Huang[4] indicated 
that viscosity of the liquid, which affects the jet’s hy-
drodynamic instability is one of the crucial elements 
determining the lower limiting velocity of the fully-
developed sprays. However, in fully-developed condi-
tion, surface tension of the liquid is much more influen-
tial than viscosity on liquid atomization[7].  
In the investigation of droplet size distribution of 
impinging sprays, Lai and Huang’s[4] experiment data 
showed the SMD distribution in lateral direction fol-
lowed the normal distribution, that is, larger droplets 
were distributed near centerline position.  At increasing 
jet velocities, the peak values of SMD distributions 
decreased.  The experimental observations by Vassallo 
and Ashgriz[8] showed that the droplet size of imping-
ing spray decreased with increasing flow rates of the 
jets, and in later investigation, Lai and Yang[8] showed 
that the ambient pressure was crucially affecting the 
droplet size distribution. As the ambient pressure wa-
sincreased, the droplet size decreased. Similar results 
were also demonstrated by Dowbrowski and Hooper [6] 
For the fully-developed impinging sprays, lateral 
motion of the droplets below the impinging point may 
occur and causes secondary collision.  Especially in the 
dense spray system, the effect of droplet collision sig-
nificantly alters the spray characteristics.[9]  From the 
experimental observations, the outcome (coalescence, 
separation, and shattering) of binary droplet-droplet 
collision was differentiated by Webber number (We) 
and impact parameter (b).[10-12]  For small values of 
We and impact parameter, droplet coalescence was 
favored.  However, for large We and b, the collision 
would resulted in either bouncing or temporary coales-

Because that the fraction of the mass within the Mal-
vern laser beam and the laser sheet at the centerline of 
the lowest observation position (25mm downstream 
from the impinging point) was roughly 0.35, 
35.0SMD  
was chosen to be compared and analyzed at various 
conditions.  
 
Experimental Results  
Both mass distribution and the 
35.0SMD  of imping-
ing sprays of water, acetone in water solution, and gly-
cerol in water solution were determined at cross-section 
from 5mm to 25mm downstream (z-direction) from the 
impinging point.  The sprays were all in fully-
developed conditions and the experimental conditions 
and the estimated 
35.0SMD  are listed in Table 2.  
For water sprays of 0.3mm jets, the 
35.0SMD  distri-
butions in z-direction at various jet velocities are plot-
ted in Fig. 5.  With 0.3mm jets, the 
35.0SMD  decreased 
rapidly with increasing downstream observation posi-
tion (z) to 15mm, and are more or less stabilized after 
that at all impinging velocities.  For sprays at various 
jet velocities, the 
35.0SMD  estimated at 5mm were al-
most invariant, however, the observations at further 
downstream showed that the 
35.0SMD  in sprays at high-
er jet velocities were always smaller.    
Changing the orifice size to 0.4mm, the results 
(shown in Fig. 6) indicated that the 
35.0SMD  at 5mm 
did not show significant differences to that with 0.3mm 
orifice size at the same jet velocity. However, the 
droplets did not further atomize as rapid after 5mm, 
instead, the droplets travel longer distance downstream 
before significant change in 
35.0SMD . It was also 
interesting to see the stabilized 
35.0SMD  of sprays from 
0.4mm jets were smaller than that from 0.3mm jets.   
For the lower surface tension liquid (acetone in 
water) impingements, the estimated 
35.0SMD of the 
sprays first increased with increasing downstream dis-
tance near the impinging point (Fig. 7).   The 
35.0SMD  
were then decreased with increasing downstream dis-
tances as the pattern shown in water impingements.  It 
was important to notice that the 
35.0SMD  at 5mm 
downstream position for acetone in water sprays was 
much smaller than that of water sprays. 
The glycerol-water solution, having a even lower 
surface tension and higher viscosity than acetone in 
water solution, was used to investigate the effect of 
viscosity on 
35.0SMD  .  As shown in Fig. 8, the 
35.0SMD  distribution patterns are very similar to that of 
water sprays shown in Fig. 5. However, for glycerol-
water solution sprays, the effect of decreasing 
35.0SMD  
with increasing jet velocities was more profound at near 
the impinging point, and, the decrease of 
35.0SMD  with 
downstream position was not as steep as that in water 
sprays. Compare to the acetone in water sprays, the 
interesting phenomenon of increasing 
35.0SMD  with 
downstream distance near the impinging point disap-
peared. 
In order to verify the effect of aerodynamic instabil-
ity on droplet size, the 
35.0SMD  at 15mm downstream 
distance of a water spray was measured under ambient 
pressures decreasing from 760 torrs down to 160 torrs, 
while the jet velocity was controlled at 36.1m/s.  As 
showed in Fig 9. the 
35.0SMD  increased from 211μm to 
302μm as the ambient pressure was decreased.   This 
result indicated that aerodynamic instability is the con-
trolling factor of the decrease of droplet size with 
downstream position in impinging sprays. 
 
Analysis and discussion  
In a fully-developed spray, the liquid jets break up 
and atomize immediately after impingement due to in-
tense hydrodynamic instability, and as the droplets 
break up from impinging point the droplet size is affect 
by both secondary collision and aerodynamic instability 
simultaneously. For all the experiments in this study, 
the 
35.0SMD  distributions in the downstream direction 
appeared to have similar pattern.  Generally, the esti-
mated 
35.0SMD  of the droplets decreased with increas-
ing downstream distances due to the effect of aerody-
namic instability.  However, at certain down stream 
distance, the droplets were stabilized as the size and 
velocity of the droplets decreased.  The stabilized 
35.0SMD were found mostly at approximately 15mm 
downstream for the present orifice sizes and velocity 
range studied.  In addition, the 
35.0SMD  estimated 
along with the downstream positions suggested a strong 
effect of jet velocity on droplet size. Smaller 
35.0SMD  
was found with higher jet velocities at same position.  
The major difference of the 
35.0SMD  profiles in the 
various impinging sprays studied occurred at positions 
near the impinging point (z<10mm) that might be 
caused by the nature of the jets impingement.  At the 
same jet velocities, the impingement of lower surface 
tension liquid jets obviously produced smaller droplets 
by comparing the data of water impingements and ace-
tone in water solution impingements shown in Fig.5 
and 7, respectively.  Since the available energy for the
