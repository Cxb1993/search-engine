現存許多熱門影片廣播法在設計時並無考慮影片
熱門程度會動態改變, 而無隙縫式動態頻道轉換機制
可協助伺服器在提供週期性廣播服務時, 針對各影片
的熱門程度, 動態增減其使用的廣播頻道數量, 以便
對頻寬資源運用進行最佳化。本計畫具體的成果為提
出無縫隙頻道轉換之近利等頻寬廣播法以支援無隙縫
頻道轉換機制, 運用分享轉換前後內容相同之片段及
補齊所錯過的片段內容, 藉此縮短轉換過程中客戶端
所需等待播放時間, 且於頻道轉換時已在收播之客戶

1緒論
隨選視訊 (Video on Demand, VoD) 是使用者透
過網路來觀看影片的一種服務, 隨著網路科技的進步,
此服務變得愈來愈普遍, 而 YouTube 的興起, 更預
期未來類似的服務會成為網際網路上新的殺手級應
用。根據文獻 [1] 的研究, 80% 的客戶需求集中在少
數(10部或 20部)較熱門的影片, 於是有學者提出熱門
影片廣播法的播送方式, 因為伺服器廣播影片所用的
頻寬與客戶人數無關, 所以這個方法非常適合用於播
送許多人收看的熱門影片, 除可用於提供近似隨選視
訊的服務外, 亦可用於有線電視播放系統、衛星電視
或 IPTV 的應用。
許多熱門影片廣播法探討客戶端所需的最短等待
時間, 包含 [2][3][4][5]。另外, 如何節省客戶端頻寬
與緩衝空間的方法也是很重要的研究題目, 相關研究
有 [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13]。前面已提出的熱門廣
播法都是以降低客戶端的等待時間、節省使用者端頻
寬與緩衝空間為目的, 皆為使用固定頻寬播放一個特
定熱門影片, 然而有關在熱門影片廣播機制中能隨著
影片受歡迎的程度而改變廣播頻寬的研究最近也備受
矚目, 無隙縫式動態頻道轉換機制可協助伺服器在提
供週期性廣播服務時, 隨著客戶端的加入和離開, 針
對各影片的熱門程度, 動態增減其使用的播放頻道數
量, 而在進行動態頻道轉換的過程中, 客戶端的收播
不會被中斷或發生影片片段不連續性的問題, 相關研
究 包 含 : Seamless FB (SFB) [14] 修 改 Fast
Broadcasting [3] 的切割影片片段函數, 在影片區段的
末端, 額外填充無意義或是廣告資料, 藉此增加原始
影片至一個適合切割並對齊於各頻道區段的片段大小,
以順利進行動態頻道轉換; 文獻 [15] 提出一個能依
工作量不同而動態轉換的廣播方法 ; Seamless
Staircase Broadcasting (SSB) [16] 修改 Staircase
Broadcasting [17] 的切割影片片段函數以支援動態頻
道配置並且只需要較小的緩衝空間; Chien, Yeh, 與
Wang 則採用與 SFB 不同的原理修改 FB, 設計出
一個動態頻道轉換之熱門廣播法[18]; Seamless Slotted
Generalized Fibonacci Broadcasting (SSGFB) [19] 則改
良 Generalized Fibonacci Broadcasting 以支援動態頻

本計畫的研究目的是設計一個可支援無隙縫式動
態頻道轉換之熱門影片廣播法 , 基於 Greedy
Equal-Bandwidth Broadcasting (GEBB) [20] 在固定頻
寬下能提供最小客戶等待播放時間的優點, 本計畫改
進 GEBB 使其能隨影片點播率而判斷各影片的熱門
程度, 依據熱門程度而無隙縫的動態增減所使用的廣
播頻道數量, 且頻道轉換時已在收播之客戶端不會被
中斷或發生影片片段不連續性之問題。
2 支援無縫隙頻道轉換之近利等頻寬
廣播法
本章分成三種情況討論提出的 SGEBB, 首先說
明沒有頻道轉換時, 影像傳輸及接收的方法; 接著討
論如何處理頻道增加(即正向頻道轉換)的情況; 最後
介紹頻道減少時(即負向頻道轉換)的播放及接收。
2.1沒有發生頻道轉換時的廣播策略
SGEBB 未進行頻道轉換時的廣播方式與 GEBB
相同。假設伺服器利用 iCCC ,,, 21  ),...,2,1( ki , 共
k 個頻道傳送 N ( Nk  ) 個影片片段, SGEBB
在伺服器端廣播影片包含下述步驟：
1. 將網路配置之總頻寬 B 等分為 k ( 1k )
換後所配置的新片段 1' iS 。
若新舊片段重複情況為圖 2(c)所示, 客戶端於重
複內容中新片段開始時間進入, 如圖 5-(a), 則只需補
足重複內容片段 1iDS ; 圖 5-(b) 中客戶端於重複內
容中新片段開始時間之後進入, 則需補足重複內容片
段 1iDS 及所錯過新片段開始時間的部份(如圖中
橫條紋部份); 圖 5-(c)、(d)、(e)中客戶端於重複內容
中新片段結束之後進入, 則可直接使用正向頻道轉換
後所配置的新片段 1' iS 。
若新舊片段重複情況為圖 2(d)所示, 該重複內容
中的新片段分佈較為特殊, 因此當客戶端於舊片段
開始時間 iHS 前進入, 如圖 6-(a)、(b), 錯過部份重
複內容中新片段內容, 則需補足重複內容片段 1iDS
及所錯過新片段部份內容; 圖 6-(c)、(d)中客戶端於舊
片段開始時間 iHS 之後, 因錯過部份重複內容, 則
需補足重複內容片段 1iDS 及所錯過新片段部份內
容(如圖中橫條紋部份); 圖 6-(e)中客戶端於舊片段的
結束部份進入, 則可直接使用正向頻道轉換後所配置
的新片段 1' iS 。當伺服器端補齊所有缺少的部份後,
即可繼續按沒有進行正向頻道轉換的方式在新配置頻
道上播放影片片段。
2.3進行負向頻道轉換時的廣播策略
伺服器於負向頻道轉換時減少頻道廣播影片, 其
步驟如下：
1. 伺服器端所使用的廣播頻道數從 k 改變至
1k 個頻道支援影片廣播。
2. 當舊配置的第一個廣播頻道 1C 廣播完片段
1S 後, 則開始進行負向頻道轉換並釋放頻道
1C 頻寬, 而舊配置的第二個廣播頻道 2C 則
轉換為 1'C 並開始廣播新片段 1'S , 當 1'S
被廣播完則可繼續進行負向頻道轉換。
3. 舊配置的廣播頻道會於服務完成而結束。
假設客戶端有足夠的緩衝空間儲存下載的影片片
段, 客戶端依照下列步驟下載片段：
1. 客戶端想要收看影片時, 必須同時下載所有頻
道中的片段。當完成下載第一個片段 1'S 後,
客戶端可以開始進行影片播放, 然而等待播放
時間是片段 1'S 的長度 'w 。
2. 當全部片段收完後, 客戶端即停止從網路下載
資料。
3效能分析與比較
此節將比較多個支援無縫隙頻道轉換的熱門影片
廣播法, 並分析於進行頻道轉換過程、頻道轉換完成
後之最大播放等待時間及緩衝空間需求。
3.1客戶端最大等待時間
假設影片長度為 120分鐘, 圖 7比較多個支援無
縫隙頻道轉換的熱門影片廣播法於正向頻道轉換期間
之在不同廣播頻道數下客戶端所需最大等待時間。於
k 個頻道轉換至 1k 個頻道之正向頻道轉換過程
中, 當 SGEBB 於每個子廣播頻道頻寬 1*b 時,
影片切割函數於不同頻道數量所切割出的片段長度皆
與 PSFB 相同, 而與以 Fibonacci 函數為影片切割函
數的 SSGFB、FPB 及以減少緩衝空間而設計的
SSB、ESS 相比, 由此圖可知, SGEBB 跟其他方法比
較均有最小等待時間。
圖 8為頻道轉換完成後之客戶端所需最大等待時
間。其中同為以 Fibonacci函數為影片切割函數的 FPB
與 SSGFB ( 2 ) 類似 , 因此 FPB 與 SSGFB
( 2 ) 時於不同伺服器廣播頻道數量下其使用者
等待時間皆相同; SSB 與修改自 SSB 的 ESS 方法
其兩者影片切割方式相同, 因此等待時間相同; SFB
修改自 FB 並於影片末端填充額外無意義或廣告資
料(dummy data), 因此等待時間比 PSFB 略多。當
SGEBB 每個子廣播頻道頻寬 1*b 時, 與 PSFB
相比則有相同的等待時間; 由此圖可知, SGEBB 跟其
他方法相比仍有最小等待時間。
3.2客戶端緩衝空間需求
圖 9、10 分析 SGEBB 於正向頻道轉換期間、頻
道轉換完成後所需的緩衝需求(以佔影片大小的百分

Abstract— In wireless and mobile communications, this
progress provides opportunities for introducing new standards and
improving existing services. Supporting multimedia traffic with
wireless networks quality of service (QoS). In this paper, a
grey-fuzzy controller for radio resource management (GF-RRM) is
presented to maximize the number of the served calls and QoS
provision in wireless networks. In a wireless network, the call arrival
rate, the call duration and the communication overhead between the
base stations and the control center are vague and uncertain. In this
paper, we develop a method to predict the cell load and to solve the
RRM problem based on the GF-RRM, and support the present
facility has been built on the application-level of the wireless
networks. The GF-RRM exhibits the better adaptability,
fault-tolerant capability and performance than other algorithms.
Through simulations, we evaluate the blocking rate, update overhead,
and channel acquisition delay time of the proposed method. The
results demonstrate our algorithm has the lower blocking rate, less
updated overhead, and shorter channel acquisition delay.
Keywords—radio resource management, grey prediction, fuzzy
logic control, wireless networks, quality of service.
1 Introduction
THE wireless networks consists of a central
switching office, namely mobile switching center
(MSC), and a set of cells, each with a fixed base
station (BS). Although the concept also applies to
radio network controller in wireless networks, and
a BS directly communicates with all mobile
stations (MSs) within its wireless transmission
radius [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. The channel
assignment (allocation) problem is an important
topic in a cellular system. The objectives of the
channel assignment of the existing results are
mainly to exploit the channel reuse factor under
the constraint of the co-channel reuse distance.

Management, Kainan University, Lu jhu, Taoyuan County, Taiwan.
Existing results for the channel assignment can be
classified into Fixed Channel Assignment (FCA)
[3], [7], Dynamic Channel Assignment (DCA) [6],
[12], [17], and Hybrid Channel Allocation (HCA)
[8]. The advantage of FCA has its simplicity.
However, it does not reflect real scenarios where
may fluctuate and vary from cell to cell.
DCA schemes can assign/reassign dynamical
channels and more flexibility. In the centralized
DCA schemes, all channels are placed in a pool
and assigned to the new calls as requirement,
which all the allocate jobs are done by MSC. In
the distributed DCA schemes, which BSs can be
need to involve. HCA techniques are designed by
combining the FCA and DCA schemes. In HCA,
channels are divided into two disjoint sets: one set
of channels is assigned to each cell on FCA basis,
while the others are kept in a central pool for the
dynamic assignment. To be more specific, load
balancing is the process of redistributing the
channels that is submitted to a network of cells so
as to avoid the situation where some cells are idle
while others are congested (hot-spots). Since the
locations of hot-spots vary from time to time, in
fact, the bandwidth increasing of a cell can
increase the system capacity but not the efficiency
to deal with the time-varying imbalance traffic.
This is achievement by transferring channels
efficiently from lightly loaded cells (cold) to
loaded heavily ones (hot).
The conventional strategies of the channel
borrowing for the load balancing usually use some
fixed threshold values to distinguish the status of
each cell. A cell load is marked as “hot”, if the 
ratio number of the available channels to the total
number of the channels allocated to that cell is less
than or equal to some threshold value. Otherwise it
is “cold”. The drawback is that thresholdvalues
are fixed. Since load state may exhibit the sharp
distinction state level, series fluctuation like

Partition the set of all cells into a number of disjoint
subsets, ,, 10 GG …, 1kG such that any two cells in
the same subset are apart from each other by at least
a distance of minD partition the set of all channels
into K disjoint subsets, ,, 10 PP …, 1kP The channels in
iP  1,...,1,0  ki are called the primary (nominal )
channels for the cells in iG , it is arranged in an
ordered list. A channel i is either used  iU or
available iV depending on whether it is assigned
to a MS. A channel available for c is interfered if it is
used by some cell in cIN . For convenience, a cell
iC is a primary cell of a channel CH if and only if
CH is a primary channel of iC . Thus, the cells in iG
are primary cells of the channels in iP and
secondary cells of the channels in  ijPj  , the
collection of cells in the coverage of the base stations
group is called a cell cluste. In a cellular system, the
arrival time of the calls, their call duration time and
the message passing overhead among the cells are
vague and uncertain. The control idea of the grey
predictions is used to predict future behaviors of a
system based on a collection of the data which
regarding the system in order to uncover the
development law, if any, of the system, and to
perform pre-controls on relevant controlling
decisions, by using the predicted future development
tendency of the system. In this way, it becomes
possible for us to prevent a predicted disaster before
it actually occurs, and to impose controls in a timely
fashion. Therefore, this method has a relatively
stronger adaptability in practical applications. The
concept of the fuzzy number plays a fundamental
role in formulating quantitative fuzzy variables.
These are variables whose states are fuzzy numbers.
The fuzzy numbers represent linguistic concepts,
such as very hot, hot, moderate, and so on, as
interpreted in a particular context. We view this
problem as an instance of a more general problem. To
transfer a channel from a cell to another cell in order
to reduce the blocking rate of the hot-spots is making
decisions under uncertain and vague conditions.
Using grey prediction can prevent borrowing or
lending channels when cell load is moderate in
the early future and avoid the system is busy in
transferring channels. In simple borrowing
strategy [17], this variant of the fixed assignment
scheme proposes to borrow a channel from the
neighboring cells provided it not to interfere with
the existing calls and lock in those co-channel
cells of the lending one. In the directed retry with
load sharing scheme [16], it is assumed that the
neighboring cells and the users overlap region
and the main drawback of this scheme include
increased number of hand-offs and co-channel
interference, and also the load sharing is
dependent on the number of users in the overlap
region. The channel borrowing without locking
(CBWL) scheme [10] propose channel borrowing
when the set of channels in a cell gets exhausted,
but to use the borrowed channels under reduced
transmission power to avoid co-channel
interference. Additionally, the facts that only a
fraction of the channels in all neighboring cells
are available for borrowing. In the load balancing
with selective borrowing (LBSB) [6], a cell is
classified as 'hot', if its degrees of coldness
defined as the ratio of the number of the available
channel to the total number of the channel
allocated to that cell is less than or equal to some
threshold value. Otherwise the cell is 'cold'. The
LBSB scheme proposes to migrate a fixed
number of channels from cold cells to hot one
through a centralized channel borrowing
algorithm run periodically by an MSC server in
charge of a group of cells. Aided by a channel
allocation strategy within each cell, it has been
presented in that the centralized LBSB achieve to
almost perfect load balancing and lead to a
significant improvement over FCA, simple
borrowing, directories and CBWL schemes in
case of an over loaded cellular system. However,
the disadvantage of hence, too much depends on
the central server in the MSC. Maintenance of
continuous status information of the cells are in
an environment where the traffic load changes
dynamically, lead to enormous amount of the
updating traffic, the consumption of wireless
bandwidth and message delay.
3 Cell Load Decision-Making
The cell load collection is one of the most
important issues in the distributed wireless
networks for load balancing approach. This
system behavior via a first-order differential
equation to approximate such a regularity and
hopefully to predict the next output from the
system. This is why it is applicable to the
time-varying nonlinear system prediction problem.
Grey Prediction is summarized as follows:
Step1: Given the original data sequence
    nxxxx 0000 ,2,1  (1)
,where x(0) corresponds to the system output at
time i, 4n .We try to predict the next x(n +
k), 4k .
Step2: Before constructing the GM(1,1) model,
the original data need to be ratio tested.

, where k =2, 3, …, n ,and k0 is called class
ratio.
When the value of class ratio falls within
0.1345-7.389, it means that the original data
sequence x(0) satisfy the grey model.
Step3: From the original data sequence 0x a
new sequence 1x is generated by the
accumulated generating operation (AGO)

the predicted value of  .10 kx
Then, we use the predicted value as the value of
the input variable for the fuzzifier.
The number of available channels is the
indicator used as an example of the calculation
procedures for the prediction formula, and the
predicted calculations for other variables follow
the same way. We will adopt four-data series from
T1 to T4 as original data to forecast the number of
available channels at T5. Before we start the
procedure, we must check the data by ratio tested
whether it can be used or not. If the data is
accepted, we can use it. The example of estimation
will involve the following steps:
1. The original data of the number of available
channels between T1 and T4
x(0)=( 5 ,10,8,3 )
2. Do the ratio test
5/10=0.5, 10/8=1.25, 8/3=2.67
the co-channel cells. The cell operation types of
load state information exchanges among cells.
Each BS keeps the state information of the cells
and runs the channel borrowing algorithm to
update load state in period.
In inference engine, the knowledge pertaining to
the given control problem is formulated in terms of
a set of fuzzy inference rules. There are two
principal ways in which relevant inference rules
can be determined. In the above rules, the
connectives AND and ALSO may be interpreted as
either intersection  or union  for different
definition of fuzzy implication. Denote the
max - min composition operators. Then we
have the following theorem governing the
connective AND with one fuzzy control rule to
obtain the conclusion. Let us assume that there is
one rule Ri with fuzzy implication Rc, the
conclusion Ccan be expressed as the intersection
of the individual conclusions of input linguistic
state variables.

The knowledge pertaining to the given
control problem is formulated in terms of a set of
fuzzy inference rules. We use five load actions,
which are Very Cold, Cold, Moderate
(stabilize-state), Hot, and Very Hot. This Section
consists of 1535  possible rules as shown in
Table 1. The two axes of the matrix are for
available channel membership function and traffic
load membership function. The entries of the
matrix represent the effects of the actions to the
goal. So an entry matrix of Table 1 means that
action and individual steps of the GF-RRM three
design phases.
The BS keeps the load state information of the
cells and runs the fuzzy based channel borrowing
algorithm to borrow free channels from the very
cold cells or cold cells whenever it finds any very
hot cell or hot cell. The moderate cells are neither
allowed for reallocation any channels from nor to
any other cells nor updated interfering cluster
cells.
5 Multi-Channel Migrating
The new channels migrating with
multi-channels transferring can reallocate channels
well especially in an unpredictable variation of cell
load. Our mechanism for multi-channel transfer
calculates the amount of transferred channels by
the number of available channels and traffic load.
The GF-RRM, we have discussed in the last
section have a common property; when a
requesting cell and a probed cell are decided, the
number of reallocated channels is just one channel
in each iteration. It is very inefficient if the cell
load of two cells differ with a large value. Our idea
is to borrow several channels once instead of only
expected value of variable. Finally, we obtain
Migrate restrict = Min [borrowing cell (Y oCOA ),
lending cell (Y oCOA )]
6 Experimental Results
The problem domain naturally lends itself to
simulate using multiple threads since there is a lot
of concurrence and global resource management
issues in the system. The simulated model consists
of 14 clusters. Each cluster consists of 7
homogeneous cells. This experiment has used the
number of channels CH =30 in a cell, total of N =
98 cells in the system. The amount of requested
channel specified of minimum basic channel units
(CU) is 30Kbps of multi-channels migration. We
assume 20001000  calls calls/per hour be
the call originating rate per cell and
101.0 00  h be the hand-off traffic
density per cell. We assume that traffic density
pattern for performance analysis as
0
h , and the
d=1 sec communication delay between cells, and
each handoff and new calls request delay
constraint DC=5 sec. So, from the simulation
result, the value of traffic load is chosen randomly
and non-linearly. The maximum numbers of
handoff calls are queued 10 for the first class
priority and new calls 10 for the second class
priority, respectively. Let the density of simulation
be 500 peoples per cell and the velocity is from
0km to 100 km/h. We define that the time of the
sample interval is 3 minutes and the sampling time
does influence previous one. The channel acquires
messages transmitted between hot cell i and cold
cell j, which are classified into four categories as
follows.
1. Request message, request (i): Message sent by
the hot cell i to cluster cells to request the free
channels.
2. Reply message, reply (j, Vj ,Uj): Message from
cold cell j, jcluster cells responding to
borrow cell i. The message also includes the
information on the reserved channels in cell j.
3. Inform message, inform (i,Bij ): Message sent
by borrowing cell i to the lending and the other
cells in the cluster to inform them about its
channel-acquisition decision, where Bij is set of
channels borrowed by hot cell i from cold cell j.
The message also includes the requests of the
reserved channels if any.
4. Confirm message, confirm (j,Lij ): Message
sent by cold cell j to borrow hot cell i to inform
it the availability of the requested channels that
have been reserved at lend cold cell j. Where
Lij is the set of confirmed channels lent from
cold cell j to hot cell i, and cold cell j can still
assign the reserved channels to new-arrival
calls before sending the confirm message back
to hot cell i.
In order to represent various multi-media
services, three different types are assumed based
on the channel requirement and QoS. The duration
of calls are distributed by different means for
different multi-media traffic types. In our
simulation three types of traffic services are
assumed: voice service, video phone and video on
demand. These types are defined on the channel
requirement 30Kbps, 64Kbps and interval
128Kbps － 256Kbps, respectively. The
assumptions of three performance metrics for our
simulation study are as follows:
1. Blocking calls: If all the servers are busy, and
the cell does not succeed to borrow a channel
from its cluster cells, then handoff and new
calls, generated at this particular cell are
stored in the queue, otherwise they get service.
If new and handoff calls do not get service of
neither free channels nor borrowed channels,
then the handoff and new calls are requested.
When it’s waiting time (delay constraint) is
over, the calls must be blocked.
2. Update Message complexity: Each cell needs
to communicate with co-channel and cluster
cells in order to exchange the set of load state
information.
3. Channel acquisition delays: The values it
acquires before the selected channels, the cell
must ensure that the selected channels will
not be acquired by any of its cluster cells and
interference cells, simultaneously. When a
cell receives a channel request from an MS, it
assigns a free channel, if any, to the request.
Otherwise, the cell will need to acquire a new
channel from its cluster cells and then assign
channels to the request.

7 Conclusion
Our work is the first propose attempt a dynamic
channel-borrowing problem with grey-fuzzy
control. The presented paper has highlighted the
role of grey-fuzzy and its application in wireless
cellular networks. In addition, GF-RRM has
shown a faster and smoother response time than
conventional systems. Based on predicted input
parameters, a set of fuzzy inference rule is
established. Since grey-fuzzy control rules are
constructed by using linguistic variables, intuitive
knowledge is easily integrated into the control
system. We believe that a fuzzy decision making
with grey prediction for the control and
management cellular networks is more appropriate
than the conventional probabilistic models. It also
can efficiently determine the suitable cell for
borrowing channels. The performance of the
proposed scheme is better than that of the
conventional schemes on the blocking rate,
messages complexity and channel acquisition
delays. The work is evaluated through simulated
comparisons with other proposals in terms of
admission ratios and message complexity. As
aforementioned, the main drive of this work is
creating a system that is adaptable, and that is
independent from specific traffic models. The
advantage of the proposed scheme might be the
result of the borrowing channels in batches instead
of a single channel at a time, in addition to
rectifying the types that are to borrow/lend
channels during a cell overload.
