Abstract: Magnetron sputtering technique was employed to fabricate the Ni-P binary and Ni-P-Al ternary 
alloy coatings with amorphous or nanocrystallized structures.  Parameters of substrate temperature, plasma 
source gas flow, and sputtering target composition were modified to figure out the correspondences of 
process controlling parameters and resultant morphology, phase, and elemental distribution of the alloy 
coatings.  It was observed that the contents for lighter elements, P and Al, of the coatings were significantly 
influenced by gas flow rate during sputtering.  The results from surface morphology investigation and X-ray 
diffraction phase identification revealed that crystallization for the Ni-P alloy coatings occurred due to higher 
manufacture temperatures of sputtering processes above 350 and 450  C for Ni-P and Ni-P-Al coatings, 
respectively.   Under process temperatures above 450  C, the Ni-P binary coating transformed from 
amorphous/nanocrystalline to a microstructure of Ni with versatile NixPy intermetallic compounds.  With the 
addition of Al in Ni-P, the transformation temperature to form Ni, NixPy and NipAlq precipitates was 
significantly increased to 550  C.  The wavy surface characteristic with a degraded roughness of several to

21. Introduction 
Nickel-phosphorous (Ni-P) is commonly employed as an alloy coating material for
surface modification in versatile industrial applications due to excellent chemical stability and 
superior mechanical properties [1-4].  In recent development, the Ni-P-based coatings are 
employed as functional interlayers for molding process, especially in the high pressure and 
elevated temperature environments [5].  The top layer coatings, such as nitride, carbon-like 
nitride, and noble metals, are deposited to provide higher strength and chemical inertness for 
the applications in high temperature.  As a matter of fact, the interlayer would go through 
elevated temperature tempering about 350 to 600C during top coating fabrication and 
practical molding process [6-9].  The surface morphology evolution, which is significantly 
influenced by process temperature, would be a important factor concerning the final surface
contour of the molding die.  
The Ni-P alloy is mostly fabricated in coating form through various manufacture 
methods, including electroplating [10], electroless deposition [11], and magnetron sputtering
technique [12].  The studies of Ni, P, and various addition elements, such as W [12-14], Cr
[15-16], Cu [17], and Al [18], sputtered from solid target to substrate to form the Ni-P-based 
coating are intensively investigated. Encouraging results on strengthening effects [19] and 
thermal stability [18] of the Ni-P-based coatings are also demonstrated.  However, detailed 
description and discussion concerning the sputtering parameters and environment and the 
4gun in the vacuum chamber followed by evacuation procedure. After loading the specimen 
on deposition holder, the chamber was evacuated down to 8x10-4 Pa followed by the inlet of 
Ar as the plasma source gas.  During sputtering, the input power and target-to-substrate 
distance for all coatings were fixed at 50 Watt. and 100 mm, respectively. The Ar flow rates
were controlled at 10 and 20 s.c.c.m. for comparison, as listed in Table 1, and the 
consequential working pressures were measured as 1.5*10-1 and 4.1*10-1 Pa, respectively.  
Substrate temperatures from unheated to 600C were carefully controlled.  Throughout the 
sputtering process, the input power was homogeneously distributed on the Ni-P/Cu (or 
Ni-P/Al) composite target, leading to steady sputtered fluxes of Ni, P (or Ni, P, Al) from Ni-P 
plated region (and drill-off area of the target surface), respectively.  As a result, Ni and P, 
(and Al) atoms from Ni-P/Cu (or Ni-P/Al) composite target were co-sputtered under adequate
arrangement.  The sputtering duration was controlled at 30 min for both sputtering guns.  
The coating thickness was around 300 nm. The compositions of the coatings were evaluated 
with the field-emission electron probe microanalyzer (FE-EPMA, JXA-8500F, JEOL, Japan) 
under a 12 kV accelerating voltage.  Quantitative analysis was conducted with the 
employment of the atomic number, absorption, and fluorescence (ZAF) correction methods
[21].  Pure Ni and Al, and InP compound were chosen as analyzing standards for 
composition evaluation of Ni, Al, and P, respectively.  A conventional X-ray diffractometer 
(Rigaku Dmmax-B, Tokyo, Japan) was utilized to identify the phases and microstructures of 
the coatings.  The surface morphologies of the Ni-P and Ni-P-Al coatings were evaluated
6several times of collisions.  Lighter elements, P and Al in present system, exhibited higher 
possibility to be scattered out of the trajectory toward sample, leading to a decrease in 
contents in films as compared to that in target.  Identical phenomenon could be found for the 
sputtering of Ni-P-Al coating under different working pressures.  The Al contents of the film 
from target III was lower than that from target II owing to the shorter mean free path and 
consequential more collisions in plasma environment.  In fundamentals of sputtering 
deposition techniques, the supply of heat onto substrate during the arrival of coating elements 
is mainly to enhance the surface diffusion for packing rearrangement of the arrived atoms.  A 
better adhesion, denser, more reasonable stress level and homogeneity, smoother surface 
morphology, and even desired microstructure, of the films could be expected [22].  The 
composition distribution of codeposited films was dependent mainly on various controlling 
parameters, such as sputtering input power, plasma density and potential, vacuum level, and 
target composition, while insignificant effect of process temperature was observed.  Tables 2 
and 3 indicate the composition analysis results of Ni-P and Ni-P-Al coatings deposited under 
various temperatures.  It was noticed that the standard deviation for averaged composition 
for each components was fixed at a low level from 0.8 to 1.2, indicating an insignificant 
correspondence between process temperatures and composition of the Ni-P and Ni-P-Al 
coatings.
8also introduced the opportunity to form NipAlq compounds for better mechanical strength and 
thermal stability.
3.3 Surface morphology
Figure 3 shows the surface morphologies of the Ni-P binary coatings deposited at 250, 
350, and 450C.  Under low process temperature of 250C, the coating surface was quite 
smooth that the corresponding Ra value was measured as 1.6 nm, as listed in Table 2.  
Slightly increased Ra of 2.7 nm was reported for the Ni-P coating deposited under 350C.  
The increase in Ra was attributed by the early stage Ni crystallization in the coating, as 
discussed in the previous section.  With higher deposition temperature of 450C, further 
crystallization of Ni matrix and precipitations of NixPy compounds were responsible for the 
magnified wavy surface contour and corresponding Ra increase, as plotted in Fig.3.  
Nevertheless, the increment of Ra with process temperature was gentle.  Even under process 
temperature of 500C, the sputtered Ni-P film showed a compatible surface roughness of 3.2 
nm with those deposited under 400 to 450C, as listed in Table 2.  Similar trend in Ra could 
be found for the Ni-P-Al coatings, as indicated Table 3, and could be easily referred to 
microstructure evolution with process temperatures.  It should be noted, however, that not 
only crystallization of Ni and NixPy, but also the formation of NipAlq compounds were
simultaneously attributed to the degeneration of surface morphology.  Fig. 4 indicates the

1Abstract
Binary nickel-phosphorus coatings (Ni-P) were fabricated by direct current (DC) 
electrodeposition with Brenner-type plating bath on pure Cu substrates. The deposition 
parameters, including current density and substrate edge geometry, were controlled to 
optimize the homogeneity and related properties of the Ni-P coatings.  The electroplated 
Ni-P coating in the as-deposited state exhibited an amorphous/nanocrystalline Ni matrix 
with supersaturated P.  With heat treatment at 350C for 1 hr, crystallized NixPy
compounds, including NiP, NiP2, Ni3P, Ni5P2, and Ni7P3, were observed.  The variation 
in composition distribution of the Ni-P deposits in edge areas of various substrate edge 
types under different current densities were evaluated and analyzed.  Homogeneously
distributed Ni and P concentrations were revealed for entire coating globally and locally at 
the edge region.  Uniform coating thickness was also demonstrated under the optimized 
conditions, current densities of 50 and 75 mA/cm2 with the 45 degree cut-off and round 
edge geometries. In addition, the homogeneity of the Ni-P coating was also revealed by 
steady hardness distribution through out the coating in the as-deposited and heat-treated 
states.

3manufactured by electroplating.  However, pretreatments on surface contour of components 
required Ni-P finishing and operation conditions by the DC electroplating are crucial in real 
practices, especially for those Ni-P coatings with high P concentration.  In present study, 
high P content Ni-P binary thick coating were plated on Cu disc by direct current 
electrodeposition technique with Brenner type solution.  Coating characteristics, including 
elemental distribution, thickness, and hardness distribution, were evaluated.  Influences of 
current density and substrate edge geometry on homogeneity of Ni-P coating were 
investigated.  Optimization of operation current density level and substrate pretreated edge 
type for a high P content Ni-P deposit with superior quality was intensively discussed.
2. Experimental Procedures
The binary Ni-P thick film of approximately 200 m was electrodeposited on an
electrical-grad pure Cu disc of 50mm to form a Ni-P/Cu coating assembly.  The Cu 
substrates were grind with #200 to #1200 sandpapers, followed by the polishing process with 
0.3 m Al2O3 powder slurry to form a smooth surface for deposition.  A Brenner type 
electrodeposition bath was adopted for Ni-P thick film fabrication [15].  The deposition bath 
comprised NiSO4*6H2O, NiCl2*6H2O, NiCO3*10H2O, H3PO4, and H3PO3 at 150, 45, 40, 50, 
and 40g/l, respectively, as indicated in Table 1. A Ni plate with purity of 99.95% was 
adopted as the anode.  The operation conditions of process temperature and deposition time 
53. Results and Discussions
3.1 Deposition process and coating thickness
The Ni-P coating was successfully on Cu substrate by electroplating technique.  Fig.1 
shows the micrograph of the Ni-P coating in assembly central region fabricated under 100 
mA/cm2 with a 45 degree cut-off edge geometry.  A smooth coating profile was observed.  
Table 3 indicates the averaged coating thickness for various coating assemblies.  The Ni-P 
fabricated under 100 mA/cm2 exhibited a thickest thickness of 50 m, while thinner films of 
approximately 20-25 m were found for those deposited with lowest current density of 50 
mA/cm2.  Detailed coating profiles near the edge portions of several coating assemblies were 
measured and plotted in Fig.2 for comparison.  Generally speaking, with the decrease in 
current density from 100 to 50 mA/cm2, an decrease in average thickness apparent.  
Nevertheless, the smoothness of the coating was raised.  Quantitative analysis on the 
thickness uniformity could be referred to Table 3.  The uniform range of various coating 
assembly was defined as the length in which the coating thickness is within 10% of the 
averaged value throughout the coating according to cross-sectional view.  Take sample A and 
C for instance, the uniform percentage dropped 10% when the current density was raised from 
50 to 100 mA/cm2.  Identical degradation was observed from specimen D and F, as listed in 
Table 3.  It was argued that the exaggerating in current density would intensify the 
deposition rate, especially in the substrate boundary area where the electrical field was more 
closely distributed than elsewhere.  Another important factor affecting the thickness 
7identical to those evaluated for all coatings, implying uniform deposition process occurred in 
all areas subjected to plating bath.  With the increase in thickness in the edge area beyond 50 
m, gradual descending of P and increase of Ni contents were observed owing to the 
completion of P in the batch type bath and concentrated throwing power in the edge region.  
Nevertheless, the averaged P content was richer than 20at.% that the coating was fairly 
categorized as high-P-content Ni-P coating [17-18].
3.3 Phase transformation and hardness
Phase identification was exerted on the Ni-P coatings in the as-fabricated and 
heat-treated conditions, as illustrated in Fig.6.  A broadened peak with relatively low 
intensity was observed at two theta around 45 degree.  The as-deposited coating was said to 
exhibit an amorphous/nanocrystallin Ni(111) microstructure where the P was co-deposited 
within.  With adequate annealing under 350C for 1 hr, sharp peaks for Ni-P intermetallic 
compounds, including NiP, NiP2, Ni3P, Ni5P2, and Ni7P3, were observed.  It was noticed that 
the peak for Ni(111) was not identified.  Since the composition of Ni-P coating was 
76.0at.%Ni-24.0at.%P, which was close to 3:1 for Ni:P, the amount of Ni crystals might be 
negligible as compared to those of the Ni-P compounds.  Thus, limited intensity for Ni was 
shown in the X-ray diffraction patterns.  Hardness of the as-deposited and annealed Ni-P 
coating was examined on distributed locations of the coating assembly, as listed in Table 4.  
The hardness values for both as-deposited and heat-treated samples were around 580 and 800 
Hv, respectively.  The elevated hardness by heat treatment was accredited on the formation 
9of 100 mA/cm2 induced a relatively high Ni deposition rate in the substrate edge region and 
suppressed the codeposition of P element in the Ni-P coating.  An optimized condition of 
current density below 75 mA/cm2 and edge geometry of 45 degree cut-off or roundly polished 
were revealed for Ni-P electrodeposition.  In addition, a uniform hardness distribution of 580 
and 800 Hv in various coating area of the Ni-P thick coatings in the as-plated and heat-treated 
conditions were demonstrated.
