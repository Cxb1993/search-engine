temperature. The primary advantage of the crystalline
approach is that the constitutive behavior can be simulated
under any loading path once the constitutive parameters of
the slip processes and grain orientations of a material are
known.
Linear isotropic elasticity is assumed for the steel metal
material, and a forth-order tensor of the elastic modulus C

For the  111110 slip system assumed for BCC crystals,
there are six different slip planes with two slip directions on
each plane. Plastic deformation, due to the crystalline slip in
metals is inherently strain rate sensitive. For rate sensitive
materials, all slip systems are considered to be activated
when the resolved shear stresses on the corresponding slip
planes are not identically zero. Therefore, a lack of
uniqueness, for the determination of the operative slip
systems associated with an imposed deformation for rate
insensitive materials is alleviated with the considerations of
strain rate sensitivity [16]. A power-law relation is used to
relate the resolved shear stress )( to the shear strain rate
)( of the th ( 12,1 ) slip system by

respectively. All slip system hardening parameters above can
be evaluated by the fitting of the stress-strain curve of a
uniaxial tensile test.

demonstrate that (110) planes become aligned at an angle off
the normal mostly in the plane defined by the surface normal
and transverse direction. Uniaxial stress- strain relationship
in the rolling direction based on the crystalline plasticity
finite element analysis with textured crystallographic

experimental measurements of SUS304 sheet [13], especially
in the region of relatively large strain, as shown in Fig. 2.

IV. CONCLUSIONS
A crystalline plasticity model implemented into the finite
element analysis could rationally assess thickness variations
of stainless steel sheets under the micro-groove fabrication
operations. The analysis model with the textured
crystallographic orientations gives fair assessments of the
sheet thickness deviation in comparison with the
corresponding experimental measurements. Initial spatial
distribution of crystallographic orientations exhibited in the
sheet could strongly influence the thickness distribution.
Effects of the implementation of various grain sizes and
different orientation assignment approaches for the
simulations on the material response might be expected in
the future.

Abstract—A Taylor-type crystalline plasticity model, implemented
into the commercial finite element analysis software, is coded as a
subroutine to investigate the behavior of a stainless steel sheet with
a body centered cubic (BCC) structure in the current study.
Thickness variations of the sheet are examined under the micro-
groove formation procedures. Effects of the spatial distribution of
crystallographic orientations on the thickness distribution over the
sheet are also demonstrated. Numerical results, based on the sheet
with textured orientations, are in good agreement with the
associated experimental measurements reported in the literature.

1 INTRODUCTION
Developments of micro/mesoscale forming
have acquired much attention due to the
increasing demand of micrometallic parts in these
years. A so-called size effect usually plays an
important role on the metal response when
characteristic dimensions, primarily referred to
the grain size and the specimen/feature size,
become significant under several loading
conditions [1-3].
Becker [4] adopted a two-dimensional finite
element model to examine metal material
responses under the plane strain compression
processes. Texture development within a grain
was reported to depend not only on the
misorientation of the neighboring grains, but also
on the constraints provided by grains sited a few
grains away. Kalidindi et al. [5] demonstrated
good predictive capabilities of a Taylor-type
crystalline model with a fully implicit time-
integration scheme. The stress-strain behavior and
the texture evolution of OFHC copper based on
the simulations agreed well with those based on
the corresponding measurements under the simple
shear and the plane strain forging processes.
Harewood and McHugh [6] utilized a finite
element analysis to monitor effects of the rate-
sensitivity embedded in the crystalline plasticity
formulations on the accuracy of calculation results.
They indicated that high mesh density might be
required to capture characteristics of relatively
rate-independent metals under the forming
procedures. Zhao et al. [7] evaluated texture
evolutions of face centered cubic metals by using
three different crystalline plasticity models. The
proposed direct numerical simulation approach
with high mesh resolution was assessed to be able
to give more accurate descriptions of the
deformations and lattice rotations inside the grains.
Recently Li and Zabaras [8] implemented the rate-
independent constitutive relations into a finite
element model to demonstrate effects of the grain
size on the uniaxial stress-strain of the metal. That
smaller grain size inducing relatively stiffer
stress-strain response was consistent with
experimental observations.
In the past, crystalline-based models have been
utilized to investigate variations of the
microstructure and mechanical properties of
metals under various forming procedures in the
past. Beaudoin et al. [9] applied the crystalline
plasticity model to the hydroforming processes of
aluminum sheets, and stated that the predicted
location and height of the ears are in good
agreement with the associated experiments.
Nakamachi and Dong [10] proposed an overall
hardening crystalline model with a dynamic-
explicit integration scheme to demonstrate inertia
effects on the deformation and the region of strain
localization. Nakamachi et al. [11] concluded that
metallic textures affect the strain localization and
earing under the deep drawing operations. Chen et
al. [12] also presented the influence of the initial
where q , the components of the matrix Q, are
related to the self hardening rate on the primary
slip system and the latent hardening rate on the
secondary slip system of a crystal, and )(h is a

rolling direction based on the crystalline plasticity
finite element analysis with textured

3 NUMERICAL RESULTS
A parallel computational scheme is utilized
due to the intensive calculation resource
commonly required for a crystalline plasticity
model. A schematic drawing with detailed
dimensions for the micro-groove fabrication
illustrated in Peng et al. [13] is displayed in Fig. 3.
A unit feature used for the finite element analysis
is also shown in the figure. Since the span of the
groove is much smaller than the width of the
workpiece, plane strain deformation can thus be
reasonably assumed. The Mooney-Rivlin model
with two parameters is used to describe
deformations of a hyper-elastic rubber material,
while both punch and die are regarded as rigid
bodies. Respectively 80 and 5 second-order plane
