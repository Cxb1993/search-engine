high and the wire-line backhaul may not be available everywhere. On the other hand, 
repeater has the problem of amplifying the interference signal and has no intelligence 
of signal control [4]. In order to achieve a better cost-effective solution, relay station 
was developed to receive and forward the signal from source to destination through 
radio interface. Here, a relay station does not need the wire-line backhaul. Therefore, 
the deployment cost of relay stations would be much lower than the cost of base 
stations. Meanwhile, since the relay station can decode the signal from source and 
forward it to the destination, intelligent resource scheduling or cooperative 
transmission can be applied to improve system performance. 
  Relay stations were also used to extend the cell coverage, enhance the user 
data-rate at cell boundary or balance the loading of adjacent cells [5-10]. In the public 
deliverable of EU WINNER project [5], multi-hop relay technology was introduced to 
increase the data rate of the boundary users or to relay user data through multiple 
relay stations to a destination that is out of base station coverage. The user data-rate 
can be increased by better signal quality and using higher modulation order. However, 
this kind of multi-hop transmissions is achieved at the expense of additional radio 
resource. The overall system capacity will be degraded if the improvement on 
transmission rate cannot break even with the cost on radio resource [6]. 
Relay stations were also proposed to balance the system load between adjacent

Ⅱ. System Model 
A cellular system, shown in Figure 1, with multiple base stations is considered in 
this research. Each cell indicates the coverage of the base station, which is located at 
the center point of the cell. In order to control the inter-cell interference, adjacent cells 
may use different frequency band. The same frequency band can be reused per K  
cells where K  is so-called frequency reuse factor. In this research, different K  will 
be considered to evaluate the performance impact from different level of inter-cell 
interference. 
Each base station (BS) controls multiple relay stations (RS) in each cell where RSs 
are deployed to improve the received signal quality. Base station can either directly 
transmit data to mobile station (MS) or relay the data through the relay stations, and 
vise versa. In the Manhattan-like urban environment, the transmission between base 
station and mobile station is typically in NLOS condition, i.e., the radio links “BS ↔ 
MS1”, “BS ↔ MS2” and “BS ↔ MS3” in Figure 1. By appropriate deployment, relay 
stations can have LOS transmission with base station, i.e., the radio links “BS ↔ RS1” 
and “BS ↔ RS2” in Figure 1. Besides, a radio link between a relay station and a 
mobile station may be either in LOS condition (e.g. “RS1 ↔ MS1” and “RS2 ↔ MS2”), 
or in NLOS condition (e.g. “RS1 ↔ MS2”, “RS1 ↔ MS3” , “RS2 ↔ MS1” and “RS2 
↔ MS3”).

A typical frame structure for multi-hop relay was proposed to separate the 
transmission of each hop in time division manner [4], which can be easily extended to 
support OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) system as shown 
in Figure 3. frameT  is the frame duration, which is divided into downlink sub-frame 
and uplink sub-frame. DLα  is the ratio of downlink sub-frame, and ,DL nβ  is the ratio 
over downlink sub-frame duration for n th hop transmission. ,

N -hops system. ,UL nβ  is the ratio for n th hop in uplink transmission. By allocating 
different time slots or sub-channels for the transmission of each hop, there is no 
intra-cell interference. In addition, since user data relayed over the air carries the same 
information, it should be subtracted when calculating the system capacity. Therefore, 
the capacity is defined as the data bits successfully received by each mobile station in 
downlink sub-frame and received by the base station in uplink sub-frame, and the 
duplicated data bits received by relay stations will not be considered. 
 
A. Proposed shadow-assisted resource reuse method 
  As stated before, in wireless communication systems, shadowing effect is usually 
treated as an adverse effect by degrading received signal power. For coverage 
planning, additional margin has to be reserved in link budget for shadowing effect to 
ensure the service availability at cell boundary [1]. By deploying the relay stations, 
 8
while RS1 and RS2 serve MS1 and MS2 by different sub-channel. In this research, we 
propose to make different relay stations to serve mobile stations by the same radio 
resources (sub-channel or time slot). The proposed method isolates the interference by 
shadowing effect through the aforementioned relay deployment criteria. Therefore, 
the capacity for the 2nd hop transmission can be substantially increased due to reuse of 
radio resources within the same cell. Meanwhile, the capacity of 1st hop transmission 
can also be increased by reusing the radio resources in different sectors. 
The frame structure of the proposed method is presented in Figure 4. A base station 
can reuse the sub-channels and time slots for the 1st hop transmission to serve relay 
stations and mobile stations in different sectors in SDMA (Spatial Division Multiple 
Access) manner. And each relay station can reuse the same sub-channels and time 
slots for data transmission in the 2nd hop.

  As for the transmission between a base station and a mobile station, which is 
located at the street level, the following NLOS path-loss model is considered.

The standard deviation of log-normal shadow fading is 8dB in this scenario.  
  For the transmission between relay station and mobile station, both LOS and NLOS 
path-loss model are considered to reflect the geography of the Manhattan-like street 
structure. For the LOS condition, the corresponding path-loss model is 
( ) ( ) ( ), 10 10, 41 22.7 log 20 log 5  RM LOSPL d f d f dB= + ⋅ + ⋅ .        (3) 
The standard deviation of log-normal shadow fading is 2.3 dB, which indicates 
different level of first Fresnel zone clearance. And the path-loss model for NLOS 
scenario should be

where d1 is the distance along the main street in meter and d2 is for perpendicular 
street as shown in Figure 6. The standard deviation of log-normal shadow fading is 
3.1 dB in this scenario, which comes from the tunneling effect in propagation 
environment. Moreover, the following antenna pattern is also applied for simulation

scheme to achieve target bit-error-rate (BER) is given by [16]. 
  Moreover, a Poisson process is considered to model the arrival of mobile stations, 
and their service requests will be granted only if the available radio resources are 
affordable. The handover mechanism is simulated to switch the serving station 
automatically based on the RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) measurement 
results. Meanwhile, adaptive rate control is adopted in each frame to adjust the 
modulation and coding scheme based on perfect channel state information. Fixed 
transmission power is considered in downlink transmission, and uplink transmission 
power control is applied along with the adaptive rate control. 
 
Ⅳ. Simulation Results 
  The downlink cell capacity is presented in Figure 7, which shows that the proposed 
 14
The simulation results show that the received signal quality can be substantially 
improved by deploying relay stations. For frequency reuse factor 1K = , a mobile 
station has 23%, 81% and 74% probability to have a received Eb/(I0+N0) higher than 
20 dB in the cases of no relay, conventional relay, and the proposed relay methods, 
respectively. It means that the received signal quality is improved by deploying relay 
stations, which is mostly achieved by the lower propagation loss from serving station 
to mobile station. On the other hand, if we draw a horizontal line at CDF=10% and 
compare the curves with 1K = . It shows that a mobile station has 10% probability to 
have signal quality lower than 4dB, 15dB and 11dB for the case with no relay, 
conventional relay method and proposed relay method, respectively. If the coverage 
planning criterion is to ensure mobile station has 90% probability to have signal 
quality better than 4dB, the conventional relay method and proposed relay method can 
lead to additional 11dB and 7 dB margin in link budget for coverage extension. 
  Figure 9 depicts that the percentage of each modulation scheme applied for 2nd hop 
transmission. For reuse factor 1K = , it shows that the proposed relay method can 
substantially increase the percentage of highest modulation order from 33.51% to 
86.93%. The reason of this increase comes from the improved signal quality 
distribution as shown in Figure 8, and it means that most of the users within the cell 
can use the highest data rate. Therefore, the data rate uniformity is substantially 
 16
transmission power instead of received signal quality. For 1K = , mobile stations 
have the probabilities 36.43%, 74.23% and 63.10% to consume the transmission 
power lower than 10dBm for the case of no relay, conventional relay method, and the 
proposed relay method, respectively. According to the better propagation environment 
and lower propagation loss, the uplink transmission power can be substantially 
reduced by relay deployment. 
  Figure 12 presents another viewpoint to evaluate the distribution of maximum 
achievable modulation order based on uplink power control. It shows that the data rate 
uniformity can be substantially improved by relay station deployment. For 1K = , the 
percentages of highest modulation order are 64.22%, 85.16% and 80.41% for the 
cases of no relay, conventional relay, and the proposed relay methods, respectively. 
Differ to downlink transmission, the interference level at receiver side (base station or 
relay station) for uplink transmission is lower because uplink receivers are always 
away from cell boundary and interference sources and uplink power control is 
adopted to avoid extra transmission power. Therefore, the percentage of 64QAM is 
relative higher than the same case in downlink.

Resource Scheduling with Directional Antennas for Multi-hop 
Relay Networks in a Manhattan-like Environment 
 
I. Introduction 
Next generation mobile cellular systems are envisioned to provide high-data-rate 
multi-media services to users anytime, anywhere at an affordable cost [1]. The 
systems are expected to operate at a higher frequency than 2 GHz because of the very 
crowded usage of the frequency bands below and around 2 GHz by the current 2G, 3G 
and other systems. With a fixed transmit power, both high data rate and high operating 
frequency indicate a smaller cell coverage for a given error rate performance. In other 
words, it requires more base stations (BS) to cover a given area in the future cellular 
system than in the traditional cellular network, and that increases the system cost 
enormously.  
Multi-hop relay (MR) cell architecture is a cost-effective cell architecture for the 
next generation wireless communication systems [2-5]. The basic concept is to set up 
low-cost relay stations (RSs) in a cell of the traditional cellular network to relay 
information from a BS to mobile stations (MSs), and vise versa. Therefore, the cell 
 30
with fixed RSs in the decode-and-forward mode. 
In recent years, more and more research has been devoted to the design of MR 
networks [6-15]. In [16], an MR network was adopted as an amendment to the IEEE 
802.16e standard [17, 18] for cell coverage extension, user throughput improvement 
and/or system capacity enhancement. In [7, 8], an MR network was proposed for the 
Manhattan-like environment, where four RSs are deployed outside of the BS’s 
coverage in a cell in order to extend the cell coverage. By utilizing the spatial 
isolation which is inherent in the Manhattan-like environment, two relay stations 
within the same cell can be scheduled to be active simultaneously, and frequency 
reuse factor of 1 can be achieved in the multi-cell environment [8]. Nevertheless, 
since there is a time interval during which the BS is not active, the radio resource is 
not fully utilized in this design. Another MR network was proposed in [6], where RSs 
are deployed within the service range of the BS for the purpose of user throughput 
enhancement. Both the BS and RSs employ omni-directional antennas to serve users 
and to communicate with each other. As a consequence, the frequency reuse factor has 
to be at least 2 in order to avoid severe co-channel interference and this reduces the 
system capacity. 
The previous research works have been mostly focused on the aspects of coverage 
extension and end-to-end user-throughput enhancement of an MR network [6-8]. In 
 32
One MR cell covers nine blocks and thus the coverage of each cell is about 
690690×  square meters. According to the technical requirements set forth by IEEE 
802.16j baseline document [16], BS and RSs are assumed to use the same air 
interference, and there is no backhaul network connection to RSs. In addition, RSs 
decode the signal from the source and forward it to the destination 
(decode-and-forward). 
To improve the system performance, the BS and RSs are equipped with directional 
antennas to communicate with users and/or each other. The service area of each 
station is also shown in Fig. 1, where the BS serves RSs and MSs in its line-of-sight 
(LOS) area with single-hop connections, while RSs serve MSs in the BS’s non 
line-of-sight (NLOS) area through two-hop connections.

III. Resource Scheduling Methods 
In this section, resource scheduling methods for MR network in a Manhattan-like 
environment are discussed. The scheduling with omni-directional antennas will be 
discussed first in Section 1.3.1 and it is used as a baseline for comparison. Then 
proposed scheduling methods with directional antennas will be discussed in Section 
1.3.2. 
 36
 
Fig. 4 Frequency reuse pattern in the multi-cell environment with omni-directional 
antennas 
 
Now consider the multi-cell structure. Because of the use of omni-directional 
antennas, the reuse factor of at least 2 is required to avoid the severe inter-cell 
interference as clearly shown in Fig. 4, and that decreases the overall system capacity. 
Scheduling with Directional Antennas 
To improve the system performance as mentioned in Section 1.3.1, resource 
scheduling methods with directional antennas is proposed. In this scenario, the BS and 
RSs are equipped with directional antennas to further exploit the advantage of 
shadowing effect in a Manhattan-like environment. As shown in Fig. 5, the BS and 
RSs are equipped with 4 directional antennas pointed to different directions, 
respectively. In different antenna directions, the radio resource can be reused 
completely. Accordingly, RSs are divided into groups according to their mutual 
 38
MSs in their service areas. 
When considering the multi-cell setup, the frequency reuse factor of 1 (universal 
frequency reuse) can be easily achieved as follows. As represented in Fig. 6 (a), in 
Phase 1, when BS1 serves the Group-A RSs and MSs in the respective directions, BS2 
in the neighboring cell serves the Group-B RSs and the MSs in the indicated 
directions. Of course, at the same time, the Group-B RSs in the cell 1, and the 
Group-A RSs in the cell 2 provide services to MSs in their service areas. In Phase 2, 
shown in Fig. 6 (b), the operation is the same by changing the role of Group-A and 
Group-B in each cell. As clearly seen, with directional antennas indicated in the 
proposed scheduling scheme, the universal frequency reuse can be achieved very 
easily. The corresponding frame structure for Method-1 is shown in Fig. 7.

over the case of the omni-directional antennas. Table 4 summaries where the capacity 
gains come from for Method-1 and Method-2 as compared with the omni-directional 
antenna case. However, due to the higher interference level observed in Fig. 11, the 
simulated capacity gain of Method-1 over the system with omni-directional antennas 
is slightly less than 6 times, as our simplified analysis predicts. On the other hand, the 
simulated capacity gain of Method-2 over Method-1 is larger than 2 because the 
former provides more higher-data-rate connections.

Abstract 
  An analysis on downlink capacity of multi-cell OFDMA 
(orthogonal frequency division multiple access) systems is 
presented in this paper under a model of randomized 
multiple access interference, which is a result of applying 
random sub-carrier allocation among different cells/sectors. 
The analysis shows that the system capacity is either in the 
bandwidth-limited or power-limited region and that 
optimum tradeoff between capacity and coverage is 
achievable in a sense that given a required capacity the 
maximum coverage can be determined. The capacity is 
evaluated for different system setups, which are 
characterized by cell radius, reuse factor and types of 
antenna system with and without spatial division multiple 
access (SDMA). Three types of antenna are considered 
including omni-directional antenna, 3-sector antenna and 
switched-beam smart antenna. Numerical results show that 
the use of 3-sector and switched-beam smart antenna can 
enlarge the bandwidth-limited region and achieves a better 
capacity and coverage tradeoff.

Ⅰ. INTRODUCTION 
Next-generation mobile communication is envisaged 
to support multimedia services over a wide variety of 
operating environments [1]. One key design issue of 
such a system is to overcome the severe inter-symbol 
interference (ISI) incurred by high-data-rate 
transmission and OFDM (orthogonal frequency 
division multiplexing) is an effective modulation 
/multiplexing scheme to combat this effect. By using 
parallel orthogonal sub-carriers along with 
cyclic-prefix, ISI can be removed completely as long 
as the cyclic-prefix is lager than the maximum delay 
spread. 
OFDMA (orthogonal frequency division multiple 
access), a form of combining OFDM and FDMA, has 
been considered as one of the most promising multiple 
access schemes for the next generation systems [2,3]. 
In OFDMA systems, users in the same cell can be 
maintained as orthogonal to each other, and thus there 
is no intra-cell multiple access interference (MAI). 
However, interference from other cells will be very 
severe, like in the traditional narrow-band systems, if 
the same sub-channel of a user is reused in the adjacent 
cells. To overcome this difficulty, allocating 
sub-carriers into a sub-channel is often permuted 
differently in the adjacent cells/sectors so as to 
randomize the inter-cell/sector MAI. It eliminates the 
most severe interfering scenarios and makes the worst 
case network planning not necessary. An OFDMA 
system employing sub-carrier permutation has already 
been adopted as part of the IEEE 802.16 standard [4].  
The capacity of OFDMA systems has recently been 
investigated in some literatures. In [5], the uplink 
capacity of multi-cell OFDMA systems with universal 
frequency reuse was investigated through Monte Carlo 
simulations under various resource allocation methods. 
The same simulation technique was used in [6] to 
investigate the downlink capacity of single-cell 
OFDMA systems. In addition, the downlink capacity 
of multi-cell OFDMA was compared with CDMA 
through simulations [7]. 
Instead of resorting to simulations, this paper aims 
to provide a mathematical analysis on the downlink 
capacity of multi-cell OFDMA systems. Based on a 
model of randomized MAI, the analysis is able to 
incorporate with the effects of propagation model, cell 
radius, frequency reuse factor and antenna systems 
with and without spatial division multiple access 
(SDMA). Numerical results are given to illustrate the 
system capacity with various system setups that lead to 
best design of the system in terms of capacity and 
coverage trade-off.  
 
Ⅱ. SYSTEM MODEL 
A. Sub-carrier Permutation and Interference Modeling 
In the IEEE 802.16 downlink OFDMA system, 
sub-carrier allocation is achieved by using a 
pseudo-random sub-carrier mapping process, called 
where ,j ip  is the downlink transmit power for iSS  
in j-th sector (beam), ( )0, 0,j iG θ  is the antenna gain 
toward the direction 0,iθ , and 0,iL  is the propagation 
loss between 0BS  and iSS , which is equal to 
0, 0, 0,
l
i i iL A r χ−= ⋅ ⋅ ,           (5) 
where 0,ir  is the distance from 0BS  to iSS , and l  
is the path-loss exponent, A  is a constant, which is 
determined by path-loss model, and 0,iχ  is a 
log-normal random variable with zero mean and 
variance 2dBσ  in dB. The effect of small-scale 
multi-path fading is included in the calculation of the 
link performance and thus is not treated explicitly here. 
From (4), the required transmit power is given by

Define jM  be the maximum number of users in 
j-th sector (beam) (one channel per user). By applying 
the weak law of large number, the total transmission 
power ,1 j ii
jM p=∑  of the sector (beam) can be 
approximated as j jM E p⎡ ⎤⋅ ⎣ ⎦  for a sufficiently 
large  jM , where jp  is a random variable that 
characterizes the BS transmit power for a user 
uniformly located over j-th sector (beam). Thus, jM  
can be obtained as

where max, jP  and ,sub channel jN −  are the maximum

sector (beam), respectively, and x⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦  is the largest 
integer less than x . jE p⎡ ⎤⎣ ⎦  is the averaged transmit 
power at  BS  for an SS  uniformly located over j-th 
sector (beam), which can be numerically derived and 
calculated [11]. 
When max, , j j sub channel jP E p N −⎢ ⎥⎡ ⎤ ≤⎣ ⎦⎣ ⎦  the system 
capacity is in the power-limited region, otherwise it is 
in the bandwidth-limited region, i.e. ,sub channel jN −  
max, j jP E p⎢ ⎥⎡ ⎤< ⎣ ⎦⎣ ⎦ . Power-limited means that 
although there still are some sub-channels (bandwidth) 
available, BS already uses up all its power. This 
happens when BS has a too large coverage (cell radius). 
On the other hand, bandwidth-limited means that BS 
runs out of sub-channels even though it has not yet 
reached its maximum transmit power, and that implies 
the coverage can be extended. With (7), the cell 
capacity can be approximated as

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS 
In this section, numerical results are given to 
illustrate the downlink capacity of the considered 
OFDMA systems in various system setups. When 
switched-beam smart antenna is considered, twelve 
antenna elements are used to generate the same number 
of beams in the following results. 
Table 1 gives the OFDMA parameters used in the 
numerical results. For a reuse factor  K , the total 
system bandwidth is 6 K⋅ MHz. In the case of SDMA, 
all sub-channels are allocated to each sector (beam) so 
that , 420 sub channel jN − = , and independent sub-carrier 
allocation is applied to each sector (beam). In the no 
SDMA case, on the other hand, sub-channels are 
divided equally into each sector (beam), i.e., 
, 140sub channel jN − = (35) and no intra-cell interference. 
The required 0bE N  ( ρ ) is set to 7dB for QPSK 
and 1 2  coding rate in Rayleigh fading channel. 
Therefore, the processing gain ( PG ) is equal to 420 . 
Maximum transmit power of base station is assumed to 
be 50 Watts, which is equally divided to each sector 
(beam). Furthermore, 136.01 10A −= ×  and 
4.375l = , the same as those used in the IEEE 802.16 
type-B path-loss model with 2 GHz carrier frequency 
and 2 8 dBdBσ =  [9]. 
In Figure 2, the capacity versus cell radius is 
presented for the single cell OFDMA systems. Clearly, 
we observe that the system capacity is either 
bandwidth-limited or power-limited, according to the 
cell radius. For example, in the case of 
omni-directional antenna, the system capacity is in the 
bandwidth-limited region when  2 R km≤ , where the 
capacity is upper-limited to 5  Mbits/sec/cell. The 
results in Figure 2 provide an optimum tradeoff 
between capacity and coverage in a sense that given a 
required capacity the maximum cell radius is 
determined. It is also observed that the system capacity 
may drop significantly after the cell radius is larger 
than certain point. This says that a good tradeoff 
between capacity and coverage may exist only within a 
range of cell radius.
