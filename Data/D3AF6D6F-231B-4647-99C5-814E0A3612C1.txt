of the proposed schemes for all above systems are almost as good as that of the tra-
ditional SLM scheme, but the proposed schemes are achieved with a substantially
lower computational complexity.

Introduction
1.1. OFDM Systems
Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a promising technique for
high data rate transmissions due to its high spectral efficiency and robustness to-
ward the interference inherent in multi-path channels. As a result, OFDM has been
adopted as the basis of various wireless standards, including digital video broad-
casting (DVB) [1], digital audio broadcasting (DAB) [2], and IEEE 802.11a wire-
less local area networks (WLAN) [3]. Orthogonal frequency division multiple access
(OFDMA) systems have emerged as the architecture of choice for broadband wireless
networks such as the IEEE 802.16 series of worldwide inter-operability for microwave
access (WiMAX) networks [4].
However, OFDM systems suffer the major drawback of a high peak-to-average
power ratio (PAPR) of the transmitted signal. Due to the large number of sub-
carriers in typical OFDM systems, the amplitude of the transmitted signal has a
large dynamic range, leading to inter-modulation distortion and out-of-band radia-
tion when the signal is passed through the power amplifier. OFDMA systems also
inherit the principal disadvantage of traditional OFDM systems, i.e. a high PAPR.
Although this problem can be avoided by operating the amplifier in its linear re-
gion, this inevitably results in a reduced power efficiency. The literature contains
various methods for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems, including clipping [5]-[7],
coding [8]-[17], selected mapping (SLM) [18]-[26], partial transmit sequences (PTS)
[27]-[35], and tone reservation (TR) [36]-[37].

presented two low-complexity SLM schemes in which the IFFT blocks were replaced
by conversion vectors obtained by taking the IFFT of the phase rotation vectors.
Suitable candidate signals were then generated by performing a circular convolution
of the IFFT of the original data sequence with these conversion vectors. Obviously,
the phase rotation vectors must contain only non-zero elements in order to ensure
that none of the sub-carrier signals in the OFDM system are blocked. To further
reduce the computational complexity of the SLM scheme, the authors imposed two
additional constraints on the selection of the conversion vectors, namely (1) the num-
ber of non-zero elements must be equal to 4, and (2) each of the non-zero elements
must belong to the set {±1,±j}. Unfortunately, however, in preparing the conver-
sion vectors using the method proposed in [21], the elements of most of the phase
rotation vectors have different magnitudes. As a result, the signals carried by the
different sub-carriers within the OFDM system have different gains and thus the sig-
nal power of some of the sub-carriers is attenuated, leading to a serious degradation
in the BER performance.
In the present study, it is shown that this problem can be resolved by using
conversion vectors specified in the form of a perfect sequence. To minimize the
computational complexity of the SLM scheme, various constraints are imposed when
searching for suitable perfect sequences. Three novel classes of perfect sequence are
introduced, each comprising certain base vectors and their cyclic-shifted equivalents.
These sequences are then utilized as the basis for three low-complexity SLM schemes.
It is shown analytically that the computational complexities of the three schemes
are substantially lower than that of the traditional SLM scheme. Moreover, the
results of a series of numerical simulations show that the BER performance of the
three schemes is identical to that of the traditional SLM method, while their PAPR
performance differs by no more than 0.64 dB than that obtained using the traditional

1.3. SFBC MIMO-OFDM Systems
Recently, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) OFDMwith space-frequency block
coding (SFBC) [38] has attracted increasing attention because it is robust to time se-
lective fading channels. However, the transmitters in SFBC MIMO-OFDM systems
have a relatively high computational complexity since they are required to perform
one inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) operation for each antenna at the trans-
mitter end. In addition, the use of the OFDM technique yields a significant increase
in the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the SFBC MIMO-OFDM system. The
literature presents a joint PAPR reduction scheme is proposed in [39] for MIMO-
OFDM systems. Unfortunately, the computational complexity of these schemes is
extremely high. In [40], researchers propose a polyphase interleaving and inversion
(PII) scheme for reducing PAPR in SFBC MIMO-OFDM systems. Although the
PII scheme needs only two inverse fast Fourier transforms (IFFTs), its computa-
tional complexity is also high since it requires an exhaustive search of all possible
parameter combinations to obtain a sequence set with the smallest maximum PAPR.
A low-complexity PAPR reduction architecture is proposed firstly in this study
for SFBC MIMO-OFDM systems that employs the Alamouti scheme. As opposed
to conventional schemes that require at least two IFFTs, the proposed scheme fully
exploits the time-domain signal relationship between the two antennas and only
needs one IFFT. The candidate signal pairs of the two antennas are generated in
the time-domain, rather than the frequency domain, for complexity reduction by
using a variety of time-domain signal properties inherent in SFBC MIMO-OFDM
systems. Extending the PAPR reduction architecture obtains two low-complexity
transmitter architectures for SFBC MIMO-OFDM systems with a general encoding
matrix and an arbitrary number of transmitter antennas. The proposed transmit-

SLM Scheme by Wang and Ouyang
In general, obtaining an improved approximation of the true PAPR in the discrete-
time case requires the time domain candidate signals to be over-sampled. For an
OFDM system with N sub-carriers, an over-sampling rate of L can be achieved by
inserting (L− 1) ·N zeros in the middle of the modulated symbol vector to form a
1× LN frequency domain data vector X, i.e.
X =
[
X0X1 · · ·XN/2−1 0 · · ·0︸ ︷︷ ︸
(L−1)·N
XN/2XN/2+1 · · ·XN−1
]
, (2.1)
where Xi is the modulated symbol of the ith subcarrier. Then, an LN -point IFFT
process is performed to generate the over-sampled time-domain signal vector x,
where the nth element of x is given by
x[n] =
1√

LN−1∑
k=0
X[k] · exp
(

)
, n = 0, 1, · · · , LN − 1. (2.2)
X[k] is the kth element of X. The PAPR of the discrete-time OFDM signal is
defined as
PAPR =
max
0≤n≤LN−1
∣∣x [n]∣∣2
E
[∣∣x [n]∣∣2] . (2.3)
Note it was derived in [41] that the true PAPR is at most CL = 1/ (cos (π/2L))
2 times
the estimated PAPR from L times over-sampling. A better estimate for L = 3/2
was given in [42].
To overcome the drawbacks of the traditional SLM scheme, Wang and Ouyang [21]

and each user is granted an arbitrary number of consecutive sub-carriers. For the
uth user in either the interleaved OFDMA uplink system or the sub-band OFDMA
uplink system, the modulated symbol of the kth sub-carrier is represented as Xu[k],
k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , N − 1. (Note that Xu[k] = 0 for k /∈ Γu.)
In general, obtaining an improved approximation of the true PAPR in the
discrete-time case requires an over-sampling of the candidate signals. For an OFDMA
system, an over-sampling rate of L can be achieved by inserting (L− 1) ·N zeros in
the middle of the modulated symbol vector. Therefore, the frequency-domain signal

The literature contains various encoding schemes for MIMO-OFDM systems
based on SFBC schemes, e.g. Alamouti code [48], ABBA code [49], Jafarkhani’s
code [50], and generalized complex linear processing orthogonal code [51]. In this
chapter, it is assumed that the MIMO-OFDM system uses a generalM×U encoding
matrix with a code rate of Q/U , i.e.
S =

where the (m, u)th element of S is given by
Sm,u =
Q−1∑
q=0
{κm,u,q ·X[q] + λm,u,q ·X∗[q]}, (2.9)
where X[q] is the qth data symbol, κm,u,q and λm,u,q are complex coefficients. An
assumption is made that the elements in the second to Mth row of S are linear
combinations of the elements in the first row and their complex conjugates, i.e.
Sm,u=
U−1∑
v=0
{
µm,u,v ·S1,v+νm,u,v ·S∗1,v
}
, m > 1, (2.10)
where µm,u,q and νm,u,q are complex coefficients.
For illustration purposes, consider a SFBC MIMO-OFDM system with four
transmitter antennas. Assuming that SFBC encoding is realized using Jafarkhani’s
code, the encoding matrix is given by

Since the signals of the M antennas are transmitted simultaneously, the PAPR
problem should be considered jointly over all the antennas. As a result, the overall
PAPR of the SFBC MIMO-OFDM system is defined as
PAPR(x) = max{PAPR(xm)|m = 1, 2, . . . ,M}, (2.18)
where x = [x1 x2 · · · xM ].
The PAPR reduction performance of the transmitter architectures proposed in
this chapter is evaluated using the complementary cumulative distribution function
(CCDF), defined as the probability of the PAPR exceeding a certain threshold γ,
i.e. CCDFPAPR(x) = Pr (PAPR(x) > γ).
13
Having performed an exhaustive search, three classes of perfect sequence of
length LN were identified. If the above constraints are removed, more perfect se-
quences can be obtained. However, the computational complexity of the conversion
process will be significantly increased.
a. Class I Perfect Sequences/Conversion Vectors
The Class I conversion vector Ga is a 1× LN vector of the form
Ga = [ga[0], ga[1], · · · ga[LN − 1]] . (3.2)
In particular, Ga is a composite of two 1× LN base vectors:
Ga1 = [−1, 0, · · · , 0︸ ︷︷ ︸

], (3.4)
where LN/2 ≥ 1. The Class I conversion vectors can be expressed in the general
form
Ga(c, w,m) = c · {Ga1 + w ·Gma2}, (3.5)
where c is any complex constant, w ∈ {±1,±j}, Gma2 denotes the mth right cyclic
shift of G0a2, and m = 0, 1, · · · , LN/2−1. Therefore, the nth element of Gma2 is given
by
gma2[n] = g
0
a2[(n−m)LN ]. (3.6)
It can be shown that different values of c result in the same PAPR. Therefore, a
value of c = 1 is adopted throughout the rest of this chapter. TABLE 3.1 presents
several representative Class I conversion vectors for LN = 16, c = 1 and selected
values of w and m.

where Re{g} and Im{g} are the real and imaginary parts of g, respectively. The
Class II conversion vectors have the general form
Gb(c,m) = c · {Gb1 +Gmb2} , (3.13)
where c is any complex constant, Gmb2 denotes the mth right cyclic shift of G
0
b2, and
m = 0, 1, · · · , LN − 1. Therefore, the nth element of Gmb2 is given by
gmb2[n] = g

b2[(n−m)LN ]. (3.14)
As discussed above, a value of c = 1 is adopted in this chapter. TABLE 3.2 presents
typical Class II perfect sequences for the case where LN = 16, Gb1[0] = 1 and c = 1.

3.1.2. Proposed Low-Complexity SLM Schemes
Based on the three conversion vector classes and their unique structures demon-
strated above, this section presents three novel low-complexity SLM schemes.
a. Proposed Scheme I (PS I)
The first scheme presented in this chapter (denoted hereafter as Proposed Scheme
I and annotated as PS I) adopts both the Class I and Class II conversion vectors.
Since the Class I conversion vectors are composites of two different base vectors and
the circular convolution process is a linear operation, the candidate signals generated
19
phase rotation vector before the second IFFT operation increases the randomness
of the corresponding phase rotation vector of the time-domain transmitted signal,
resulting in an improvement of the PAPR reduction performance.
c. Proposed Scheme III (PS III)
In the third scheme presented in this chapter (denoted hereafter as Proposed
Scheme III and annotated as PS III), the candidate signals are generated by per-
forming an LN -point circular convolution of the time-domain signal vector x with
the Class III conversion vector Gc:
ym = x⊗LN Gc
≡ p1 ·Am1c1 + p2 ·Am2c2 + p3 ·Am3c3 + p4 ·Am4c4 , (3.22)
where Amici ≡ x⊗LN Gmici , and i denotes the index of the base vectors and has values
of i= 1, 2, 3, and 4. In Eq. (3.22), Am1c1 =
[
Am1c1 [0], A
m1
c1 [1], · · · , Am1c1 [LN − 1]
]
.
Since the base vector Gm1c1 is given by G

c1 =

c1 [1], · · · , gm1c1 [LN − 1]

the equal-magnitude complex constants p2, p3, and p4. As noted in Section 2.2.3,
values of p1 = 1 and p2, p3, p4 ∈ {±1,±j} are adopted in the present chapter. In
addition, m1 = 0 and 0 ≤ m2, m3, m4 ≤ LN4 − 1. Thus, the maximum number of
candidate signals generated using Class III conversion vectors is (LN

)3 ·43 = (LN)3.
3.2. A Low-Complexity PAPR Reduction Scheme for OFDMA
Uplink Systems
In contrast to traditional SLM schemes, in which multiple IFFTs are required, the
proposed scheme requires just one IFFT. The architecture of the investigated PAPR

equivalents of the original signal multiplied by various complex numbers. Note that
to constrain the computational complexity of the investigated architecture, this
study limits the number of combined signals within each CSGB to just four. As a
result, the mth candidate signal of the uth user has the general form:
xu,m = xu + am,1 · ejθm,1 · xpm,1u + am,2 · ejθm,2 · xpm,2u + am,3 · ejθm,3 · xpm,3u , (3.28)
where am,1, am,2, am,3 are non-negative real numbers, θm,1, θm,2, θm,3 ∈ (0, 2π], xpu
denotes the pth cyclic shift of xu, and pm,1, pm,2, pm,3 ∈ {0, 1, . . . , LN −1}. It should
be noted here that zero, one, or two elements of the set {am,1, am,2, am,3} can be zero.
In other words, each candidate signal is produced by a total of two, three or four
signals, where one of these signals is the original time-domain transmitted signal.
Taking the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of both sides of Eq. (3.28), the kth
sub-carrier of the mth candidate signal in the frequency domain can be written as:
Xu,m[k] =
(
1 + am,1 · ejθm,1 · e−j2πkpm,1/LN + am,2 · ejθm,2 · e−j2πkpm,2/LN
+ am,3 · ejθm,3 · e−j2πkpm,3/LN
) ·Xu[k]
≡ Gm[k] ·Xu[k], (3.29)
where Gm[k] can be regarded as the complex gain of the kth sub-carrier.
For the sub-carriers assigned to a given user, the complex gains Gm[k], k ∈ Γu,
should have the same magnitude in order to ensure that the signal powers of the
different sub-carriers have the same gain, i.e. |Gm[k]| = A, ∀k ∈ Γu, where A is
a positive real number. Consequently, the number of cyclic shifts and the complex
multipliers used within the CSGB are not arbitrary, but must be properly selected.
25
In principle, many different parameter combinations exist which satisfy these
constant-gain-magnitude constraints. The candidate solutions can thus be obtained
via an elaborate trial-and-error procedure. A number of solutions are provided in
Appendix B for each of the constraints of the four sub-carrier groups.
To reduce the computational complexity of the investigated architecture, can-
didate solutions should be chosen to minimize the number of complex multipliers.
In addition, the candidate signals generated by these solutions should yield sig-
nificantly different PAPR performances such that the proposed architecture has a
better opportunity to select a signal with a low PAPR. By performing a series of
simulations (results omitted here for reasons of brevity), the first solution presented
in the Appendix B for each sub-carrier group is selected to construct the proposed
scheme. Interestingly, the four selected solutions have the following general form:
xu,m = xu + e
jπ(ψ−1)/4 · xLN/8u + ejϕm ·
[
xpmu − ejπ(ψ−1)/4 · xLN/8+pmu
]
, ψ = 1, 2, 3, 4,
(3.34)
where ϕm ∈ [0, 2π) and pm ∈ {0, 1, . . . , LN − 1}. This general form allows a single
implementation to adopt arbitrary sub-carrier group.
The results shown in Eq. (3.34) can be extended to the case where the number of
interleaved sub-carrier groups is any positive integer power of two, as demonstrated
in Theorem 3.1. Therefore, Theorem 3.1 allows the OFDMA uplink system to be
configured to various interleaved architectures by using a single implementation.
Theorem 3.1. Considering an interleaved OFDMA uplink system, the N sub-
carriers are partitioned into Ψ interleaved sub-carrier groups denoted as Tψ = {k ·
Ψ + ψ − 1|k = 0, 1, . . . , (N/Ψ − 1)}, ψ = 1, 2, . . . ,Ψ, where Ψ is any positive inte-
ger power of 2 and N/Ψ is a positive integer. The time-domain signal of the uth
user is denoted as xu and the sub-carriers assigned to the uth user are denoted as
27
where (·)LN denotes the modulo LN operation. Similarly, the nth element of v2 can
be written as:
v2[n] =
2√
LN
·
LN
2Ψ
−1∑
k′=0
X ′u[(2k
′ + 1)Ψ + ψ − 1] · ej2πn[(2k′+1)Ψ+ψ−1]/LN . (3.40)
It can be easily obtained from Eqs. (3.38) to (3.40) that xu = {v1 + v2}/2. Per-
forming DFT to v1 and v2 obtains V1 and V2, respectively, where the kth element
of V1 and V2 is respectively given by:
V1[k] =
{
2 ·X ′u[k],
0,
k = {2k′Ψ+ ψ − 1|k′ = 0, 1, . . . , LN
2Ψ
− 1}
otherwise
(3.41)
V2[k] =
{
2 ·X ′u[k],
0,
k = {(2k′ + 1)Ψ + ψ − 1|k′ = 0, 1, . . . , LN
2Ψ
− 1}
otherwise.
(3.42)
We note that ξm is an unit-magnitude constant and performing time-domain cyclic
shift is equivalent to performing frequency-domain phase rotation. In addition, the
non-zero elements of V1[k] and V2[k] do not overlap. Therefore, the absolute value
of the DFT of xu,m in Eq. (3.35) can be written as:
|Xu,m[k]| =
∣∣V1[k] + ξm · V2[k] · e−j2πkpm/N ∣∣
=
{
2 · |X ′u[k]| ,
0,
k = {k′ ·Ψ+ ψ − 1|k′ = 0, 1, . . . , LN
Ψ
− 1}
otherwise
(3.43)
where Xu,m[k] is the kth element of the DFT of xu,m. In other words, the frequency-
domain signal has a constant gain and Eq. (3.35) satisfies the equal-gain-magnitude
constraint. As a result, xu,m in Eq. (3.35) is a valid candidate signal.
Theorem 3.1 provides us with an easy method to construct the proposed low-
complexity PAPR reduction scheme (designated hereafter as Proposed Scheme) as
delineated in Fig. 3.5, where various candidate signals are constructed by per-
forming cyclic shifts and complex additions, leading to a significant decrease in
computational complexity.
29
Theorem 3.2. For the sub-carriers assigned to the uth user, Γu ⊆ Tψ, ψ =
1, 2, . . . ,Ψ, where Ψ is any positive integer power of 2 and N/Ψ is a positive in-
teger, the time-domain signal vector xu has the form:
xu =
[
xTu,1, λ2,ψ · xTu,1, . . . , λΨ,ψ · xTu,1
]T
, (3.45)
where xu,1 is an LN/Ψ × 1 vector and consists of the first LN/Ψ elements of xu,
and λd,ψ = e
j2π(d−1)·(ψ−1)/Ψ, d = 2, 3, . . . ,Ψ.
Proof. Since Γu ⊆ Tψ, the first LN/Ψ elements of the uth user can be obtained
from Eq. (2.5) as
xu[n] =
1√
LN
{ N
2Ψ

j2πn(LN −Ψ(k + 1) + ψ − 1)
LN
)]}
,
n = 0, 1, · · · , LN/Ψ− 1. (3.46)
Similarly, the ((d − 1) · LN/Ψ)th to the (d · LN/Ψ − 1)th signal elements, i.e. the
dth signal block of (LN/Ψ)-element, of the uth user can be obtained from Eq. (2.5)
as
xu[n + (d− 1) · LN/Ψ] = 1√

(3.47)
where
β = exp(j2π(d− 1) · (Ψk + ψ − 1)/Ψ) = exp(j2π(d− 1) · (ψ − 1)/Ψ), (3.48)
and
γ = exp(j2π(d− 1) · (LN −Ψ(k + 1) + ψ − 1)/Ψ) = exp(j2π(d− 1) · (ψ − 1)/Ψ).

the uth user. Substituting Eq. (3.29) into Eq. (3.50) and performing mathematical
manipulations, it can be shown that∣∣∣∣∣
3∑
n=0
am,n · ejθm,n · e−j2π(ru+su)pm,n/LN
∣∣∣∣∣ = Au, ∀k ∈ Γu, (3.51)
where am,0 = 1, θm,0 = 0, pm,0 = 0, ru is the index of the first sub-carrier of Γu,
su = 0, 1, . . . , Su − 1, and Su is the number of sub-carriers in Γu. Since each user
is assigned arbitrary consecutive sub-carriers among the total available sub-carriers,
the equal-gain-magnitude constraint should be fulfilled for any arbitrary ru and any
Su ≤ N . Therefore, the constraint given above can be rewritten in the following
general form:
|Gm[k]| = A, ∀k ∈ {0, 1, . . . , N − 1}. (3.52)
In other words, the constraint is obtained by substituting ru = 0 and Su = N into
Eq. (3.51).
Comparing Eq. (3.51) with Eq. (3.31), it can be seen that the two equations
are equivalent if ru = 0, ψ = 1, and su = 4l. Consequently, the solutions for
sub-carrier group 1 of the interleaved OFDMA system can also be adopted for the
sub-band OFDMA system given suitable modifications. As discussed in Section III-
A for the interleaved OFDMA uplink system, the ideal candidate solutions require
the minimum number of complex multipliers and result in the best PAPR reduction
performance. Therefore, the candidate signals generated by each CSGB in the sub-
band OFDMA system have the following form:
xu,m = xu + x
LN/2
u + ξm ·
[
xpmu − xLN/2+pmu
]
, (3.53)
where ξm ∈ {±1,±j}, and pm ∈ {0, 1, . . . , LN − 1}. We note that Eq. (3.53) does
not require complex multiplications since ξm ∈ {±1,±j}.
It is worth noting that Eq. (3.53) is a particular case of Eq. (3.35) in Theorem
3.1 by setting Ψ = 1. In other words, the proposed scheme as demonstrated in Fig.
33
in which two IFFT operations are performed, where R is a random phase rotation
vector whose elements belong to the set {±1,±j}.

Application to PAPR Reduction in SFBC MIMO-OFDM
Systems
3.3.1. Time-Domain Signal Properties for SFBC MIMO-OFDM Sys-
tems
This section introduces the six time-domain signal properties for SFBC MIMO-
OFDM systems utilized in this chapter to construct the proposed transmitter archi-
tectures and the corresponding PAPR reduction schemes. Consider a data vector
A of size N × 1. Then, define TUu ≡ {u + i · U |i = 0, 1, . . . , N/U − 1}, where
u = 0, 1, . . . , U − 1, and 1 ≤ U ≤ N . We recall that both N and U are non-negative
integer powers of two and N/U is a positive integer. A can then be written as
A =
U−1∑
u=0
AUu , (3.54)
where AUu is an N × 1 vector, and the kth element of AUu , k = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1, is
given by
AUu [k] =
{
A[k], k ∈ TUu
0, otherwise
(3.55)
where A[k] is the kth element of A. Let the IFFTs of A and AUu be denoted as a
and aUu , respectively. Since IFFT is a linear operation, it is easily shown from Eq.
(3.54) that
a =
U−1∑
u=0
aUu . (3.56)
Although aUu can be obtained by applying IFFT to A
U
u , a
U
u can also be obtained
from a via a time-domain multiplication operation, as demonstrated in the following
35
aUu [n+N/U ] =
U−1∑
w=0
e−j2πuw/U · a[(n + wN/U +N/U)
N
]
=
U−1∑
w=0
e−j2πu(w−1)/U · a[(n + wN/U)
N
]
= ej2πu/U · aUu [n]. (3.62)
Therefore, αUu,1 = exp(j2πu/U). Similarly, it can be shown that α
U
u,q = exp(j2πuq/U),
q = 0, 1, . . . , U − 1. Therefore, aUu has the form given in Eq. (3.60).
Property 3.3. For any U ′ > 4, where U ′ is a positive integer power of two, A can
be written as
A =
U ′−1∑
u=0
AU
′>4
u =
3∑
v=0
AU=4v . (3.63)
Performing IFFT on AU
′>4
u and A
U=4
v yields a
U ′>4
u and a
U=4
v , respectively. a
U ′>4
u
and aU=4v are related as follows:
aU
′>4
u =
U ′/4−1∑
w=0
e
j2piuw
U′ · aU=4,ξv , (3.64)
where v = (u)4, a
U=4,ξ
v denotes the ξth cyclic shift of a
U=4
v , and ξ =
wN
U ′
.
Proof. From Eqs. (3.57) and (3.58), the nth element of aU=4v can be written as
aU=4v [n] =
3∑
w=0
e−j2πvw/4 · a [(n+ wN/4)

= a [(n)

+ e−j2πv3/4 · a [(n + 3N/4)

= a [(n)
N

N
]
+ ej2πv(4−2)/4 · a [(n + (N − 2N/4))
N
]
+ ej2πv(4−3)/4 · a [(n +N −N/4)

=

Proof. Since bUu is the IFFT of B

Property 3.6. Define D ≡ AU,su , where AU,su denotes the sth cyclic shift of AUu .
Performing IFFT on D yields d. The nth elements of d can be written as d[n] =
aUu [n] ·ej2πsn/N . In addition, define E ≡ (AUu )∗. Performing IFFT on E gives e. The
nth element of e is given by e[n] =

Note that this property is a direct result of IFFT and thus the corresponding
proof is omitted.
Concluding above properties, a number of remarks related to the computational
complexity are provided below. For U ≤ 4, there are three remarks for Property 3.1,
Property 3.2, and Property 3.5, respectively.

matrix is assumed to have the form given in Eqs. (2.8) to (2.10).
a. Proposed Low-Complexity Transmitter Architecture I
In SFBC MIMO-OFDM systems, the time-domain transmitted signals of the
various antennas, xm, m = 1, 2, . . . ,M , can be obtained from Eq. (3.56) as
xm =
U−1∑
u=0
xUm,u, (3.73)
where xUm,u ≡ gUu · xm. Since the frequency-domain signal elements of the second to
the Mth antennas are linear combinations of the frequency-domain signal elements
of the first-antenna and their complex conjugates (see Section 5.1), the FFT of xUm,u,
i.e. XUm,u, can be written as
XUm,u =
U−1∑
v=0
{
µm,u,v ·XU1,v + νm,u,v ·
(
XU1,v
)∗}
, m > 1, (3.74)
where XU1,v is the FFT of x
U
1,v. Therefore, the nth time-domain signal element of
xUm,u, n = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1, can be obtained from Property 3.6 as
xUm,u[n] =
U−1∑
v=0
{
µm,u,v · xU1,v[n] · ej2π(u−v)n/N + νm,u,v ·
{
xU1,v[(−n)N ]
}∗ · ej2π(u−v)n/N}.
(3.75)
It is worth noting here that the time-domain transmitted signals of the various
antennas, i.e. xm, m = 2, 3, . . . ,M , can be obtained from Eqs. (3.73) and (3.75).
In other words, the time-domain transmitted signals of the various antennas can
be easily obtained using the same set of signal components xU1,u generated from the
time-domain transmitted signals of the first antenna by applying Property 3.1 with
various gUu , i.e.
xU1,u = g
U
u · x1, u = 0, 1, . . . , U − 1. (3.76)
From the discussions above, it is clear that the time-domain transmitted signals of
the various antennas at the transmitter end can be obtained from the time-domain

domain transmitted signal of the first antenna, x1. To obtain the transmitted signals
of the other antennas, Property 3.1 or Eq. (3.76) is applied to generate various signal
components xU1,u by using various g
U
u . The complexity of the proposed transmitter
architecture is reduced by utilizing Property 3.2 (see the Signal Fragment Repetition
and Multiplication I (SFRM I) block within SG I) since each signal component xU1,u
consists of U identical signal fragments multiplied by various complex numbers αUu,q.
As a result, only the first N
U
elements need be obtained when applying Eq. (3.76)
since the remaining (U−1)·N
U
elements are obtained directly from the SFRM I block.
The construction of the time-domain transmitted signals of the various antennas
is performed by the ASG block. As shown in Fig. 3.8, the elements
(
xUm,u[n]
)
of the
various signal components xUm,u, m = 2, 3, . . . ,M , u = 0, 1, . . . , U − 1, are generated
43
It is worth noting here that only the firstN/4 elements of xU=41,u need be obtained from
Eq. (3.77) since the rest 3N/4 elements can be easily obtained by using Property
3.2. Let AU=4u,q be a 4 × 4 matrix in which the (u, q)th element is given by αU=4u,q ,
u = 0, 1, 2, 3, and q = 0, 1, 2, 3. The coefficients of the SFRM in Fig. 3.7 are given
by
AU=4u,q =

. (3.82)
The transmitted signal of the second antenna can be obtained from Eq. (3.73)
as follows:
x2 =
3∑
u=0
xU=42,u , (3.83)
where the nth element of xU=42,u , u = 0, 1, 2, 3, is given by
xU=42,0 [n] = −{xU=41,1 [(−n)N ]}∗ · e−j2πn/N , (3.84)
xU=42,1 [n] = {xU=41,0 [(−n)N ]}∗ · ej2πn/N , (3.85)
xU=42,2 [n] = −{xU=41,3 [(−n)N ]}∗ · e−j2πn/N , (3.86)
xU=42,3 [n] = +{xU=41,2 [(−n)N ]}∗ · ej2πn/N . (3.87)
The transmitted signals of the third and the fourth antennas can be obtained in a
similar way.
Two remarks related to the computational complexity of PA I are provided in
the following for the case of U ≤ 4.
Remark 3.10. For the SG I block, applying Property 3.1 or Eq. (3.76) involves
only complex additions, as indicated in Remark 3.5. In addition, the use of Property
3.2 involves no complex operations, as described in Remark 3.6.

to each of the U outputs of SG I, SG II, MSG I, or MSG II, respectively, where

After generating P candidate signal sets, the signal set with the lowest PAPR is
selected for transmission in accordance with Eq. (2.18). It is noted that a total
of ⌈log2 P ⌉ side information bits are required for decoding proposes at the receiver
end.

Analysis of Computational Complexity
4.1. Low Complexity PAPR Reduction Schemes for OFDM
systems
In Proposed Schemes I and II, applying the circular convolution of x with Ga1,
G0a2, Gb1, and G
0
b2 involves a total of LN , LN , 3LN , and 3LN complex additions,
respectively. In addition, a total of LN complex additions are required to combine
Aa1 or Ab1 with the cyclically shifted versions of A
0
a2 or A
0
b2. Since both Class I and
II conversion vectors are adopted, the total number of complex additions required
in Proposed Scheme I to generate M candidate signals is 8LN + (M − 1)LN =
(M +7)LN . Similarly, the total number of complex additions required in Proposed
Scheme II is (M + 14)LN .
In Proposed Scheme III, a total of 3LN complex additions are involved in per-
forming the circular convolution of x with Gc1, Gc2, Gc3, orGc4. However, according
to Eq. (3.27), only the first LN/4 points of the circular convolution are required.
In addition, 3LN complex additions are required to combine Am1c1 , A
m2
c2 , A
m3
c3 , and
Am4c4 . Hence, the total number of complex additions required in Proposed Scheme
III to generateM candidate signals is equal to 4·(3LN/4)+(M−1)·3LN = 3MLN .
TABLE 4.1 and Fig. 4.1 compare the computational complexities of various
schemes for LN = 2048, where each IFFT operation involves (LN/2) log2(LN)
complex multiplications and (LN) log2(LN) complex additions. From Fig. 4.1, it
can be seen that the number of complex additions required in Proposed Scheme I is
less than that required in W&O scheme I for M > 5. In contrast, Proposed Scheme

additions to generate v2. It is shown in Theorem 3.2 and Remark 3.3 that only the
first LN/Ψ signal elements are required to calculate the PAPR of each candidate
signal. Therefore, it takes LN/Ψ complex additions to generate the first LN/Ψ
signal elements of v1. Similarly, it takes LN/Ψ complex additions to generate the
first LN/Ψ signal elements of each candidate signal.
As discussed above, the PAPR reduction performance of the proposed scheme
can be enhanced via its integration with the traditional SLM scheme, as shown in
Fig. 3.6 for the case of the modified Proposed Scheme with two IFFTs. Given the

Figure 4.2 illustrates the variation of the number of complex operations of the
three schemes as a function of the number of candidate signals for the illustrative
case of LN = 2048, Ψ = 4, and Q = 1 IFFT. From inspection, the number of
complex multiplications and additions required in the proposed scheme for an in-
terleaved OFDMA uplink system with M = 32 and Q = 1 is just 3.69% and 5.68%,

4.3. Low Complexity Transmitter Architectures and Their
Application to PAPR Reduction in SFBC MIMO-OFDM
Systems
This section evaluates the computational complexities of the proposed transmitter
architectures and PAPR reduction schemes, respectively. Note that in performing
the analyses, the complexity of the SFBC encoding process is deliberately excluded
since the encoding complexity is the same in every case. In addition, the analyses
consider the case in which only one of νm,u,v and µm,u,v, v = 0, 1, . . . , U − 1, in Eq.
(3.75) has a non-zero value, i.e.
xUm,u[n] = µm,u,v · xU1,v[n] · e
j2pi(u−v)n
N or xUm,u[n] = νm,u,v ·
{
xU1,v[(−n)N ]
}∗ · e j2pi(u−v)nN .
(4.2)
It is noted that most existing encoding matrices meet this constraint.
4.3.1. Proposed Low-Complexity Transmitter Architectures
1) Proposed Architecture I
In SG I of Fig. 3.7, the N -point IFFT operation requires N
2
· log2(N) complex
multiplications and N · log2(N) complex additions. For the case of U ≤ 4, Eq. (3.76)
is adopted to generate various signal components for the first antenna xU1,u. Since
there are U nonzero elements of {±1,±j} in each row of gu, a total of U−1 complex
additions are required to obtain each element of xU1,u. Property 3.2 is then adopted
in the SFRM I block to reduce the complexity by ensuring that only the first N
U
elements of xU1,u are required. In accordance with Remark 3.6, the SFRM I block
requires no complex operations. As a result, a total of (U − 1) ·(N
U
) ·U = N ·(U − 1)
complex additions are required to generate the U signal components xU1,u. For the
case of U > 4, MSG I is adopted (see Fig. 3.9), Property 3.1 is used to generate xU=41,v ,
59
a total of N · (U − 1) · (M − 1) complex additions are required to generate the
transmitted signals of the various antennas using Eq. (3.73).
2) Proposed Architecture II
For the second proposed transmitter architecture, xU1,u Signal Generator II in
Fig. 3.11 performs U N
U
-point IFFTs and therefore involves a total of N
2
· log2(NU )
complex multiplications and N · log2(NU ) complex additions. For the case of U ≤ 4,
Remark 3.7 indicates that the diagonal elements of RUu belong to the set {±1,±j}
when 4nu
U
is an integer. As a result, it can be shown that Eq. (3.90) requires
(N
U
−1) · (U−2)+(N
U
−1) complex multiplications to generate xU1,u,frac. In addition,
as explained in the PA I, the SFRM I block does not require any complex operations.
The ASG block in Fig. 3.11 for PA II has the same computational complexity as
that of the ASG block in Figs. 3.7 and 3.8 for PA I. However, PA II requires an
additional N(U − 1) complex additions to generate x1.
For the case of U > 4, Modified Proposed Architecture II (MPA II) shown in
Fig. 3.12 is adopted. As in the case of U ≤ 4, it can be shown that Eq. (3.90)
requires (N
U
− 1) · (U − 2) + (N
U
− 1) complex multiplications to generate xU1,u,frac.
In addition, applying Property 3.2 to generates the first N
4
elements of x1,u requires
N
2
·∑log2 U−3i=0 {2−i−2U − 1} complex multiplications. It is noted that the SFRM II
block does not require any complex operations and the complexity of the MASG
block is the same as that of the MASG block in MPA I.
TABLE 4.4 summarizes the computational complexities of the proposed trans-
mitter architectures. Numerical results reveal that the computational complexity
of the PA II (or MPA II) scheme is always lower than that of the PA I (or MPA
I) scheme. For example, for N = 1024, M = 4, and U = 4, the PA II reduces
the number of complex multiplications and complex additions by 65% and 50%,
respectively, compared to the traditional SFBC MIMO-OFDM transmitter.

cyclic-shifts or phase-rotations in the CSPR block, the corresponding computational
complexities in the ASG and MASG blocks are different. For example, if phase-
rotation is performed, where ru,p belongs to the set {±1,±j}, Eqs. (3.91) and
(3.92) show that only N · (M − 1) complex multiplications are required when using
Eq. (3.92) to generate the first set of modified signal components x
(p)
1,u. (Note
that the remaining sets of modified signal components are obtained by applying
various phase rotations.) Again, it is noted that only one of νm,u,v or µm,u,v, v =
0, 1, . . . , U − 1, in Eq. (3.92) has a non-zero value. However, if the candidate signal
sets are obtained using a cyclic-shift operation, each signal set requires a new set of
modified signal components x
(p)
1,u. As a result, the ASG and MASG blocks require
63
reduction schemes.
It is worthy of note that although the phase-rotation operation does not require
any additional complex operations to realize Eq. (3.92) when generating a new
candidate signal set, the cyclic-shift operation results in a better PAPR reduction
performance, as demonstrated in Section 5.6.
Figure 4.3 presents the computational complexity of the various schemes as a
function of the number of candidate signal sets for M = 4, N = 1024, and U =
4. Note that of the proposed schemes, results are presented only for the PA II
architecture since this architecture has a consistently lower complexity than the PA
I architecture. An inspection of Fig. 4.3 reveals that for P = 64 and S = 64, the
number of complex multiplications and additions required in PA II is just 15.31%
and 30.31%, respectively, of that required in the traditional SLM scheme. Similarly,
for P = 64 and S = 1 , the number of complex multiplications required in PA II is
just 0.55% of that required in the traditional SLM scheme. It is also observed that
PA II involves a constant number of complex additions irrespective of the value of
S.

make them less frequent. Therefore, the SLM scheme cannot give a guarantee on
PAPR. On the other hand, coding methods have been adopted for PAPR reduction
[15]-[16]. These coding schemes are deterministic algorithms that de-randomize the
search for the sign vector and achieve a guaranteed PAPR. In particular, Sharif and
Hassibi have proposed an algorithm [15] (denoted as S&H scheme) to design signs
that guarantee deterministically that the PAPR is less than c logn for any number
of sub-carriers n, where c is a constant independent of n. In addition, a greedy algo-
rithm proposed in [17] has lower complexity compared to that of [15] while achieving

The PAPR reduction performance of the proposed schemes was evaluated by per-
forming a series of simulation experiments. In performing the simulations, the
OFDMA system was assumed to have N = 512 sub-carriers and the data were
16-QAM modulated. In addition, the over-sampling rate was specified as L = 4 in
order to approximate the true PAPR. For comparison purposes, simulation results
were obtained for both the traditional SLM scheme and the proposed scheme with
Q = 1 and Q = 2 IFFT operations.

PAPR performance to that of Proposed Scheme III, but involves the use of an
additional IFFT operation. Finally, Proposed Scheme I has the least number of
complex multiplications and additions of the three schemes, but yields the poorest
PAPR performance. For the particular case of LN = 2048 and M = 64, the
number of complex multiplications required in Proposed Schemes I and III is just
1.56% of that required in the traditional SLM scheme. Similarly, the number of
complex additions required in Proposed Schemes I and III is just 11.65% and 28.84%,
respectively, of that required in the traditional SLM scheme.
However, the three proposed schemes are only utilized in the OFDM systems.
They can not be extended to utilize in the OFDMA systems. Therefore, this study
has also presented a low-complexity scheme for PAPR reduction in OFDMA uplink
systems using either an interleaved or a sub-band sub-carrier assignment strategy.
The proposed scheme requires just one IFFT and the candidate signals are generated
by linearly combining the original time-domain transmitted signal with multiple
cyclic shift equivalents. To ensure that the signal powers of the different sub-carriers
have an equal gain, various feasible combinations of the number of cyclic shifts and
the complex multipliers have been presented. In addition, a modified architecture
has been proposed for improving the PAPR reduction performance by integrating
the proposed scheme with the traditional SLM scheme. Furthermore, the time-
domain signal property of the interleaved OFDMA system has been exploited to
further reduce the computational complexity.
The simulation results have shown that the PAPR reduction performance of the
proposed scheme is marginally poorer than that of the traditional SLM scheme.
However, the proposed scheme have significantly lower computational complexities.
Specifically, for the case of M = 32 candidate signals and Q = 1 (i.e. 1 IFFT oper-
79
traditional SLM scheme for the case of P = S = 64 and Pr(PAPR > γ) = 10−3.
However, the proposed PAPR reduction scheme reduces the number of complex mul-
tiplications and additions to just 15.31% and 30.31%, respectively, of that required
in the traditional SLM scheme for P = 64 and S = 64. In addition, for the case
of P = 64, S = 16, and Pr(PAPR > γ) = 10−3, the proposed scheme results in
a maximum performance loss of no more than 0.46 dB compared to that of the
traditional SLM scheme, but reduces the number of complex multiplications to just
4.06% of that required in the traditional SLM scheme.

Gc[s] = N · pu · e−j2πmus/N , u = (s)4 + 1. (A.6)
Let the magnitude of p1, p2, p3, p4 be equal to
√
P . Since the exponential term has
a unit magnitude, the square of the absolute value of Gc[s] is given by
|Gc[s]|2 = N2 · P, s = 0, 1, · · · , N − 1. (A.7)
Since Gc[s] have equal magnitude, the PACF of Gc has the form of a delta function
and Gc is proven to be a perfect sequence.

正交分頻多工系統中用以降低峰值對平均功率比之低複雜度選擇對應技術
研究

97 -2221-E -110 -005 -MY2 通訊
在多載波系統中具有低複雜度之降低峰值對平均功率比值方法
國立中山大學 李志鵬,王森弘,李坤昇
在正交分頻多工(orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, OFDM)系統
中，一個很大的缺點是其峰值對平均功率比值(peak-to-average power ratio,
PAPR)過高的問題，易導致傳送端功率放大器產生非線性效應，造成訊號失真，
或導致傳送端功率放大器效率變低。過去有研究提出選擇映射法(selected
mapping, SLM)可以降低PAPR，但所需複雜度過高，欲產生M個候選訊號
(candidate signal)就需要M個反快速傅立葉轉換(inverse fast Fourier
transform, IFFT)運算，導致實際應用上的困難。本發明主要改進傳統SLM的方
法，設計一低複雜度的SLM架構，只運用一個IFFT和一些複數加法器即可產生出
M個候選訊號，同時在PAPR降低的效能上，與傳統SLM相比，有幾乎相同的效能
，例如：當子載波個數N為64，調變方式為16-QAM，超取樣倍數L為4，在M=64時
，PAPR降低的效能只變差了0.26dB，而當LN=2048，M=64時，複數乘法器只需要
傳統SLM的1.56%，複數加法器只需要傳統SLM的28.84%，並且此架構不會使位元
錯誤率(bit error rate, BER)上升。
