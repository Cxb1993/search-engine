The paper [Chein-Shan Liu, 2001, Cone of nonlinear dynamical system and group preserving schemes, 
Int. J. Non-Linear Mechanics, vol.36, pp.1047-1068] constructed a mathematically equivalent 
augmented system on the future cone in an n+1-dimensional space for the general n-dimensional 
nonlinear dynamical system. In the space with dimensions one higher, the underlying space of the 
nonlinear dynamical system is a Minkowski space and the symmetry group is the proper orthochronous 
Lorentz group. In doing so, three structures of geometry, Lie algebra and Lie group are brought out for 
the nonlinear dynamical system. After five years the paper [Chein-Shan Liu, 2006, The Lie-group 
shooting method for nonlinear two-point boundary value problems exhibiting multiple solutions, 
CMES: Computer Modeling in Engineering & Sciences, vol. 13, pp. 149-163] basing on the 
closure-property of Lie group and a universal mapping between two points on the cone, derived an 
algebraic equation to determine unknown missing initial conditions for boundary value problems. This 
finding has a great significiance for a theoretical study of the nonlinear boundary value problems, as 
well as opens a new tool of Lie-group shooting method (LGSM). In this research project, we study the 
mathematical foundation of Lie-group shooting method when it is used on the calculations and 
analyses of different engineering inverse problems governed by partial differential equations. This 
project is divided into three-years, during which period we shall settle down in-depth a firmly 
mathematical foundation of the Lie-group shooting method, and develop its numerical schemes and 
conduct the analyses for different engineering inverse problems of partial differential equations. The 
most significant contributions of this project would be that we do not need to use the concept of 
regularization to treat the inverse problems as that usually employed in the conventional numerical 
methods, the essentially ill-posed property of inverse problems can be overcome, and the gap of 
numerical methods for direct and inverse problems can be shortened. This project would provide stable, 
accurate and effective numerical methods for engineering inverse problems of partial differential 
equations. This three-years project was divided into three major portions: the first-year project  
proposes a mathematical development of the LGSM for the parameters identifications of parabolic type 
partial differential equations (including time-, spatial-or temperature-dependent parameters), the 
second-year project develops the LGSM calculational schemes for the final time inverse problems of 
wave equations (including different initial and final times conditions), and the third-year project  
develops the LGSM calculational schemes for the parameters identifications of elliptic type partial 
differential equations (including Robin coefficient and impedance coefficient of electric impedance 
tomography). Under the third-year project of this study four papers were published, and one was in

Abstract This paper presents a Lie-group shooting method for the numerical solutions of 
multi-dimensional nonlinear boundary-value problems, which may exhibit multiple 
solutions. The Lie-group shooting method is a powerful technique to search unknown 
initial conditions through a single parameter, which is determined by matching the 
multiple targets through a minimum of an appropriately defined measure of the 
mis-matching error to target equations. Several numerical examples are examined to 
show that the novel approach is highly efficient and accurate. The number of solutions 
can be identified in advance, and all possible solutions can be numerically integrated 
by using the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method. We also apply the Lie-group shooting 
method to a numerical solution of an optimal control problem of the Duffing oscillator.

vital in the recovery of qualitatively correct behavior in the minimization of numerical
error [3, 4].
For the initial value problems (IVPs) of ordinary differential equations (ODEs),
Liu [4] was the first to endow them with three structures: a geometrical cone struc-
ture, a Lie-algebra structure, as well as a Lie-group structure. Indeed, they are three
different aspects but of the same ODEs presented in the Minkowski space. This devel-
opment is continued here to approach the general n-dimensional nonlinear boundary-
value problems (BVPs) of ODEs with a Lie-group formulation. The main result is
coined to an n-dimensional system of nonlinear algebraic equations, providing a rela-
tion between the initial-value, the final-value and the vector field into a single vector-
valued equation. This Lie-group shooting equation is essentially inherent in all the
two-point BVPs governed by the n-dimensional ODEs. With its help, the finding of
numerical solution of n-dimensional nonlinear boundary-value problem becomes a
quite easy and feasible task.
In the study of optimal control theory for nonlinear structures, one often encoun-
ters two-point boundary-value problems (TPBVPs), which pose a certain difficulty in
the computation of control force in the nonlinear optimal control systems, and they
are usually solved through iteration of the corresponding linearization of TPBVPs.
Some methods exist for solving the TPBVPs; we name a few, finite element method,
finite difference method, collocation method, simple shooting method, and series so-
lution method, etc. In the solutions of BVPs, a simple shooting method (SSM), the
simplest technique of initial value methods, was already analysed in detail in many
textbooks, like Kubicek and Hlavacek [5], Keller [6], and Ascher et al. [7].
The SSM is a useful and easy-to-implement method. However, it has the draw-
backs of instability and inaccuracy as to be shown in Sect. 2 by an ill-posed example.
These defects are sometimes alleviated by more complex initial value methods, such
as the multiple shooting method, the stabilized marching method, the Riccati method
[7], and the modified simple shooting method [8].
In a previous paper [9], the author has proposed the Lie-group shooting method
(LGSM) for solving the second-order two-point BVPs. In this paper, we will extend
the LGSM to the multi-dimensional nonlinear BVPs. The LGSM includes a favorable
aspect of the SSM and yields a fast and accurate method for solving the nonlinear
BVPs, even the BVPs may exhibit multiple solutions. The approach of the nonlinear
BVPs is based on the group-preserving scheme (GPS) developed previously by Liu
[4] for solving the IVPs of ODEs. Liu [9–11] has extended the technique of GPS
to solve the BVPs, and the numerical results revealed that the Lie-group solver is a
rather promising method to effectively solve the second-order BVPs. In the construc-
tion of the Lie-group method for the solutions of BVPs, Liu [9] has introduced the
idea of one-step GPS by utilizing the closure property of the Lie group, and hence,
the new shooting method has been labeled the Lie-group shooting method (LGSM).
The LGSM was also shown effective to the second-order general BVPs [10], to the
singularly perturbed BVPs [11], to the Sturm–Liouville eigenvalue problems [12], as
well as to the generalized Sturm–Liouville eigenvalue problems [13].
Because the Lie-group method possesses a certain advantage due to its Lie-group
structure, the LGSM was already shown to be a powerful technique to solve the
second-order BVPs [9]. However, the methodology of LGSM is not yet applied to

demonstrated that such a kind boundary-value problem is highly ill-posed. Wazwaz
[17], and Attili and Syam [18] have employed the Adomain decomposition method
to solve a series of initial-value problems involved in the second-order BVPs. Ben
Zitoun and Cherruault [19] have developed some series solutions of the nonlinear
BVPs by using the technique based on a combination of the Faa Di Bruno’s formula
together with the method of Filchakov. In order to avoid a complicated inversion for
solving the resultant nonlinear algebraic equations of the BVPs, Liu [20] has devel-
oped a fictitious time integration method to solve a more general m-point BVP.
In this paper, we solve the following n-dimensional nonlinear boundary-value
problem (BVP) by a novel shooting method:
y˙1 = f1(t,y1,y2), 0 < t < 1, (6)
y˙2 = f2(t,y1,y2), 0 < t < 1, (7)
H
(
y1(0),y2(0),y1(1),y2(1)
) = 0, (8)
where y1 ∈ Rm1 , y2 ∈ Rm2 and m1 + m2 = n. y1 is the collection of all variables,
whose initial conditions are given explicitly or can be solved out numerically; hence,
m1 may be zero. The boundary conditions are specified by an n-vector valued func-
tion of mixed type.
In the vector form of boundary-value condition in (8), we can further identify
two different subclasses of boundary-value equations: one does not include the final
values of y2, and another includes the final values of y2:
H0
(
y1(0)
) = 01, (9)
Hf
(
y1(0),y2(0),y1(1),y2(1)
) = 02, (10)
where H0,01 ∈ Rp , Hf ,02 ∈ Rq , p + q = n, p ≤ m1 and q ≥ 1. We may call (10)
the target equation, and the numerical error that does not match (10) under an ap-
propriate measure is a “mis-matching error of target”, or simply the “error of target”.
When Hf is independent of y1(0) and y2(0), then the boundary conditions are the
most simplest ones, being called the separated boundary conditions. In fact, the most
currently available software for BVPs assumes that the boundary conditions be sepa-
rated. Examples of the two-point boundary-value problems are the first-order neces-
sary conditions obtained by an application of the Pontryagin Maximum Principle in
the optimal control theory, which usually have separated boundary conditions.
The time-stepping techniques developed for solving the initial-value problems
(IVPs) require both the initial conditions of y1 and y2 for the n-dimensional ODEs.
If the initial values of y1 and y2, denoted as y1(0) = y01 and y2(0) = y02, are avail-
able, then we can numerically integrate the following IVP step-by-step in a forward
direction from t = 0 to t = 1 by using the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method (RK4):
y˙1 = f1(t,y1,y2), (11)
y˙2 = f2(t,y1,y2), (12)
y1(0) = y01, (13)
y2(0) = y02. (14)

where Xk denotes the numerical value of X at the discrete tk , and G(k) ∈ SOo(n,1)
satisfies
GTgG = g, (23)
det G = 1, (24)
G00 > 0, (25)
where G00 is the 00th component of G.
3.2 Generalized Mid-Point Rule
Applying scheme (22) to (18) with an initial condition X(0) = X0 we can com-
pute X(tk) at the subsequent discretized time tk by using the GPS. Assuming that
the stepsize used in the GPS is h = 1/K , and starting from an initial augmented
condition X0 = X(0) = ((y0)T,‖y0‖)T we can calculate the value Xf = X(1) =
(yT(1),‖y(1)‖)T, by applying (22) step-by-step:
Xf = GK(h) · · ·G1(h)X0. (26)
Because each Gi , i = 1, . . . ,K , is an element of the Lie group SOo(n,1), and by
the closure property of the Lie group, GK · · ·G1 is also a Lie-group element, denoted
by G. Hence, we have
Xf = GX0, (27)
which is a one-step Lie-group transformation from X0 to Xf .
We can calculate G by employing a generalized mid-point rule, which is obtained
from an exponential mapping of A by taking the values of the argument variables of
A at a generalized mid-point. The Lie group generated from such an A ∈ so(n,1),
which is viewed as a constant matrix, by an exponential mapping admits a closed-
form representation as follows:
G =
⎡
⎣
In + a−1‖fˆ‖2 fˆfˆT
bfˆ
‖fˆ‖
bfˆT
‖fˆ‖ a
⎤
⎦ , (28)
where
yˆ = ry0 + (1 − r)yf , (29)
fˆ = f(tˆ , yˆ), (30)
a = cosh
( ‖fˆ‖
‖yˆ‖
)
, b = sinh
( ‖fˆ‖
‖yˆ‖
)
. (31)
Here, r ∈ [0,1] is a parameter and tˆ = r .
Equation (28) can be derived alternatively by using the following Lie-group dif-
ferential equation:
G˙ = A(t,y)G. (32)

and from (41) and (42) it follows that
‖yf ‖
‖y0‖ = cosh
(
S
η
)
+ cos θ sinh
(
S
η
)
. (44)
Upon defining
Z := exp
(
S
η
)
, (45)
from (44) we can derive a quadratic equation for Z:
(1 + cos θ)Z2 − 2‖y
f ‖
‖y0‖ Z + 1 − cos θ = 0. (46)
On the other hand, by inserting (40) for F into (39) we can obtain
∥
∥yf − y0∥∥2 = (a − 1)(yf − y0) · y0 + b∥∥y0∥∥∥∥yf − y0∥∥. (47)
Dividing both sides by ‖y0‖‖yf − y0‖ and using (42), (43) and (45) we can obtain
another quadratic equation for Z:
(1 + cos θ)Z2 − 2
(
cos θ + ‖y
f − y0‖
‖y0‖
)
Z + cos θ − 1 = 0. (48)
From (46) and (48), the solution of Z is found to be
Z = (cos θ − 1)‖y
0‖
cos θ‖y0‖ + ‖yf − y0‖ − ‖yf ‖ , (49)
and then from (45) and (43) we obtain
η = ‖y
f − y0‖
lnZ
. (50)
Therefore, between any two points (y0,‖y0‖) and (yf ,‖yf ‖) on the cone, there
exists a Lie-group element G ∈ SOo(n,1) mapping (y0,‖y0‖) onto (yf ,‖yf ‖),
which is given by
[
yf
‖yf ‖
]
= G
[
y0
‖y0‖
]
, (51)
where G is uniquely determined by y0 and yf .
It should be emphasized that the above G is different from the one in (28). In
order to feature its dependence only on y0 and yf , we write it to be G(y0,yf ). How-
ever, these two Lie-group elements G(r) and G(y0,yf ) are both indispensable in our
development of the Lie-group shooting method for the multi-dimensional nonlinear
BVPs.

For a specified r and the given vector fields f1 and f2, (59) and (60) together
with (8) constitute a system of nonlinear algebraic equations, which can be used to
solve the unknowns of (yf1 ,y
0
2). By starting from an initial guess of (y
f
1 ,y
0
2), we can
produce the new (yf1 ,y
0
2) by an iteration process, until (y
f
1 ,y
0
2) converges according
to a given stopping criterion:
√∥∥yf1,i+1 − yf1,i
∥∥2 + ∥∥y02,i+1 − y02,i
∥∥2 ≤ . (63)
If y02 is available, we can return to (11)–(14) and integrate them to obtain yf2 . The
above process can be done for all r in the interval of r ∈ [0,1]. Among these solutions
we can pick up the correct r , which leads to the smallest error of Hf in (10), since
yf2 is our target value at the terminal time and Hf = 02 is our target equation. That
is,
min
r∈[0,1]
∥
∥Hf
(
y01,y

2,y
f
1 ,y

)∥∥. (64)
Generally speaking, the proof of existence of solution for multi-dimensional non-
linear BVP can be quite difficult. If there exist solutions the present LGSM can find
the solutions because the above minimization is carried out for a continuous function
‖Hf ‖ of r in a compact space of r ∈ [0,1]. When the minimization is existent, we
can use the initial conditions solved from the above minimization and other given
initial conditions, by a numerical integrator to find the numerical solutions.
5 Numerical Examples
In order to assess the performance of the newly developed method of LGSM, let us
investigate the following numerical examples.
Example 1 For the problem in (1) we can consider a small translation of u by y =
u + ε, such that we have
y′′(x) = y′ + 20y(x) − 20ε, y(0) = 1 + ε, y(10) = 1 + ε. (65)
Then we change the variable from x to t by t = x/10, and we have
y¨(t) = 10y˙(t) + 2000[y(t) − ε], y(0) = 1 + ε, y(1) = 1 + ε. (66)
Now we can apply the Lie-group shooting method to solve the above problem, espe-
cially that developed by Liu [9], which was used to find the missing initial condition
in a closed-form formula in terms of r . The numerical solution is then compared with
the exact solution:
u(x) = 1
e50 − e−40
[(
e50 − 1)e−4x + (1 − e−40)e5x]. (67)
The disturbance is taken to be ε = −5.3 × 10−19, which is used to avoid the zero
values of both u and u′ in most portion in the range of x ∈ [0,10] as shown in Fig. 1.
It can be seen that the numerical solution is close to the exact solution.

Fig. 2 For Example 2: (a) plotting the error of mis-matching to target with respect to y1(0), and (b)
displaying two different solutions
integrate (68). There exist two solutions which are marked by yai and ybi , i = 1,2,3
in Fig. 2(b).
This example shows that a simple shooting method can sometimes be very effec-
tive when the missing initial condition is located in the one-dimensional real space as
that for y01 ∈ (0,0.6). However, when there are multiple unknown initial conditions,
a simple shooting technique may be ineffective to find the solutions. The following
examples would show that the new method of LGSM in Sect. 4 can retain the most
advantages of the simple shooting method, and is also available for searching the
multiple unknown initial conditions in a one-dimensional real space of r ∈ [0,1].

Comparing (77) with (34) and noting that

⎡

ry01 + (1 − r)yf1
)2 + (ry02 + (1 − r)yf2
)2 + (ry03 + (1 − r)yf3
)2
. (83)
We can solve the last two equations in (82) by using yˆ3 = ry03 + (1 − r)yf3 , such
that
y03 =

For a specified r and given y01 = 0, y02 = 0 and yf2 = 1, and starting from an
initial guess of (yf1 , y
0
3 , y
f
3 ), the first equation in (82) and (84) can generate the new
(y
f

f
3 ) by repeating the above iteration process, until (y
f

according to a given stopping criterion:
√(

1,i+1 − yf1,i
)2 + (y03,i+1 − y03,i
)2 + (yf3,i+1 − yf3,i
)2 ≤ . (85)
If y03 is available, we can return to (74) and (75) and integrate them to obtain yf2 .
The above process can be done for all r in the interval of r ∈ [0,1]. Among these
solutions we can pick up the best r by
min
r∈[0,1]
∣
∣yf2 − 1
∣∣, (86)
which leads to the smallest error of |yf2 − 1| in (75), since y2(1) = 1 is our target at
the right-end boundary.
We consider β = −0.15 and η∞ = 10. In Fig. 3(a) we plot the error of target with
respect to r . It can be seen that there are two minimal points as marked by points a
and b. When the range for minima is identified we can pick up more correct value of

subject to
y1(0) = 1, y2(0) = 1, y3(1) = 3, y4(1) = 12 . (88)

t3, y2(t) = 1 − 72 t +

2
t2,
y3(t) = 3, y4(t) = 72 − 3t.
We are going to search two missing initial conditions y3(0) = y03 and y4(0) = y04 ,
such that in the numerical integration of (87), yf3 and yf4 can match the exact values
of y3(1) = 3 and y4(1) = 1/2.
Applying the LGSM to this example we show the numerical results in Fig. 4.
Starting from an initial guess with (yf1 , y
f
2 , y
0
3 , y

4) = (2,0.5,1,3), we let r run in
the range of r ∈ [0,1], and for each r we can integrate (87). The correct r is obtained
from
min
r∈[0,1]
√(
y
f
3 − 3
)2 + (yf4 − 0.5
)2
. (89)
The curve of the error of target is plotted in Fig. 4(i) with respect to r . yf3 and yf4
are the numerical integration values of y3 and y4 at the end point t = 1. When the
missing initial conditions are available, with all other given initial conditions, we can
integrate (87) by using the RK4. The numerical results are compared with the above
exact solutions as shown in Figs. 4(a)–4(d). They are almost identical. The numerical
errors are then plotted in Figs. 4(e)–4(h), which showing the numerical method is very
accurate. The number of iterations under  = 10−8 to find the solutions of missing
initial conditions are about 15 for each r . Therefore, we can very quickly pick up the
correct r which provides a minimal error to fit the last two targets in (88).

where
C1 = 2 − e

We consider a variable transformation t = x/xf , such that we have

which is subjected to
y1(0) = 1, y2(0) = 1, y1(1) = 2, y2(1) = 2. (93)
We have to find two missing initial conditions y3(0) = y03 and y4(0) = y04 , such
that in the numerical integrations of (92), yf1 and yf2 can match the exact values of
y1(1) = 2 and y2(1) = 2.
Applying (59) and (60) to the above equation we can obtain
y

The above four equations are combined with (93) to solve

f

xf η

because of yˆ1 = yˆ2 = 2 − r . Repeating the iteration process until the solutions are
convergent according to the criterion in (63), and we can pick up r by the following
equation:
min
r∈[0,1]
(∣∣yf1 − 2
∣∣ + ∣∣yf2 − 2
∣∣). (97)
We consider two cases of xf = 1 and xf = 5. The numerical results are compared
with the above exact solutions as shown in Figs. 5(a)–5(d). They are almost identical.
Because of y1 = y2 and y3 = y4 we only show the numerical results for y1 and y3.
The numerical errors are then plotted in Figs. 5(e)–5(h), from which one can see that
the present LGSM is quite accurate.

they studied a physiological flow problem, of which the governing equations are

where 0 ≤ x ≤ λ, and λ > 1 is a given parameter. m and ρ = λ2/(mk2) are given
parameters. The boundary conditions are v(0) = 0 and C(λ) = 1. The quantity of
most interest is the dimensionless emergent osmolarity Os = 1/v(λ).
Shampine et al. [27] have converted the above problem into a four-dimensional
problem in the interval of 0 ≤ t ≤ 1:
y˙1 = 1
m
(y2 − 1), y˙2 = 1
ρ
[y1y2 − t],
y˙3 = 1
m
(λ − 1)(y4 − 1), y˙4 = 1

(99)
with the unseparated boundary conditions:
y1(0) = 0, y4(1) = 1, y1(1) = y3(0), y2(1) = y4(0). (100)
Applying (59) and (60) to the above equations we can obtain
y

(101)
The above four equations are combined with (100) to solve out

(103)
Repeating the iteration process we can obtain the solutions until they are convergent
according to the criterion in (63). We can pick up the correct r by the following
equation:
min
r∈[0,1]
(∣∣yf4 − 1
∣∣ + ∣∣yf1 − y03
∣∣ + ∣∣yf2 − y04
∣∣). (104)
We use the LGSM to solve this BVP for m = 0.1, λ = 2 and k = 2. Starting from
an initial guess with (y02 , y
0
3 , y
f
3 , y

4) = (1.5,0.5,1,0.5), we let r run in the range
of r ∈ [0,1], where the correct r is located at the minimal point in the curve of the
error of target with respect to r as shown in Fig. 6(a). The number of iterations under
 = 10−10 to find that the solutions of missing initial conditions are about 25 for
each r . Therefore, we can quickly pick up the correct r which provides a minimal
error to fit the three targets in (100). Figure 6(b) shows the solutions of v(x) and
C(x).

where the boundary conditions are given by
y1(0) = y2(0) = y3(0) = 1, y4(0) = −10, y3(1) = y5(1). (107)
The above problem can be solved by a simple shooting method by adjusting y05 since
the other four initial conditions are already given, and there is only one target equation
y
f
3 = yf5 .
In the original version, Ascher et al. [7] have taken a1 = 9/10, a2 = 1000
and a3 = 100. However, a simple shooting method indicates that the condition
y3(1) = y5(1) cannot be matched. In the following we employ a1 = a2 = a3 = 1. Ap-
plying (59) and (60) to the above equations we have
y
f
1 = 1 +
ηyˆ1

η
2‖yˆ‖ (yˆ3 − yˆ1), y

5 = yf3 +
η
‖yˆ‖ (yˆ5 − yˆ3), (109)
which can be used to find the solutions until they are convergent according to the
criterion in (63). We can pick up the correct r by the following equation:
min
r∈[0,1]
∣∣yf3 − yf5
∣∣. (110)
In Fig. 7(a) we plot the error of target with respect to r , from which we can quickly
pick up a correct r . Then the numerical solutions of y3 and y5 are plotted in Fig. 7(b),
wherein we can see that the final target yf3 − yf5 = 0 is matched very well. For the
comparison purpose we also plot the curves of y3 and y5 solved by a simple shooting
method as shown by the dashed lines in Fig. 7(b); however, these curves are almost
coincident.
Example 8 Ascher et al. [7] have described a flow in a long vertical channel with
fluid injection through one side with the following boundary value problem:
f ′′′ −R(f ′2 −ff ′′)+RA = 0, h′′ +Rfh′ +1 = 0, θ ′′ +Pf θ ′ = 0, (111)
where R is the Reynolds number and P = 0.7R. Because A is an unknown parameter,
this system is subjected to the following eight boundary conditions:
f (0) = f ′(0) = 0, f (1) = 0.5, f ′(1) = 1,
h(0) = h(1) = 0, θ(0) = 0, θ(1) = 1. (112)
In terms of y1 = f , y2 = f ′, y3 = f ′′, y4 = h, y5 = h′, y6 = θ and y7 = θ ′, we
can write this problem as a system of seven first-order differential equations:
y′1 = y2, y′2 = y3, y′3 = R
(
y22 − y1y3
) − RA, y′4 = y5,
y′5 = −Ry1y5 − 1, y′6 = y7, y′7 = −Py1y7,

From this investigation we first apply (59) and (60) to the above first three equa-

(115)
where y1 = (y1, y2, y3) and η1 is the corresponding η. At the first, from the above
three equations we can solve

Under the initial conditions y01 = 0 and y02 = 0, for each given A we run this iteration
process until yf1 , y

minimizes the error of |yf2 − 1|. Then we choose a suitable A by minimizing the
error of |yf1 − 0.5|.
Applying (59) and (60) to the fourth and the fifth equations in (113) we can obtain

where y2 = (y4, y5) and η2 is the corresponding η. From these two equations we can
solve
y05 = (1 − r)
η2
‖yˆ2‖ , y
f
5 = −
η2
‖yˆ2‖ , (118)
because of yˆ5 = 0. For each given r we run the above iteration process until y05 and
y
f

Applying (59) and (60) to the last pair equations in (113) we can obtain

For each given r we can run the above iteration process until y07 and y

ill-posedness of BHCP is over other inverse heat conduc-
tion problems including the sideways heat conduction
problem, which is dealt with the reconstruction of
unknown boundary conditions. The main motivation is
placed on an eﬀective solution of the BHCP, which is one
of the inverse problems, and is diﬀerent from the sideways
heat conduction problem recently reviewed and calculated
by Chang et al. [17] with the GPS.
The present paper will provide a new shooting method
for the BHCP. Our approach is based on the study by
Liu [18–20] with an extension applied to the solutions of
multiple-dimensional and multiple targets BVPs. In [18–
20] a Lie group shooting method (LGSM) is ﬁrst developed
by the second author to solve the BVPs of the second order
ODEs. It is clear that our method can be applied to the
BHCP, since we are able to search for the missing initial
condition through an iterative solution of r in a compact
space of r 2 ð0; 1Þ, where the factor r is used in a general-
ized mid-point rule for the Lie group of one-step GPS.
Another advantage is that with the application of the Lie
group we can develop an eﬀective numerical scheme, whose
accuracy is much better than other numerical methods.
Through this study, we may have an easy-implementation
and accurate LGSM used in the calculations of the
BHCP.
2. Backward heat conduction problems
We consider a homogeneous rod of length l. The rod is
suﬃciently thin such that the temperature is uniformly dis-
tributed over the cross section of the rod at time t. The sur-
face of the rod is insulated and thus, there is no heat loss
through the boundary. In many practical engineering
application areas, we may want to recover all the past tem-
perature distribution uðx; tÞ, where t < T , of which the tem-
perature is presumed to be known at a given ﬁnal time T.
Here, we consider the following problem:

uð0; tÞ ¼ u0ðtÞ; uðl; tÞ ¼ ulðtÞ; 0 6 t 6 T ; ð2Þ
uðx; T Þ ¼ hðxÞ; 0 6 x 6 l: ð3Þ
Here these three quantities of u, x and t are normalized,
such that they are dimensionless.
Eqs. (1)–(3) are called a one-dimensional backward heat
conduction problem, which is known to be highly ill-posed,
namely, the solution does not depend continuously on the
input data uðx; T Þ. Actually, the rapid decay of temperature
with time results in the fast fading memory of initial condi-
tions. Thus, the numerical recovery of initial temperature

We can calculate G by a generalized mid-point rule,
which is obtained from an exponential mapping of A by
taking the values of the argument variables of A at a
generalized mid-point. The Lie group generated from

ﬁnal uf ¼ ðu1ðT Þ; . . . ; unðT ÞÞ through a suitable weighting
factor r to calculate G, where r 2 ð0; 1Þ is a parameter
and t^ ¼ rT : The above method is applied by a generalized
mid-point rule on the calculation of G, and the result is a
single-parameter Lie group element denoted by GðrÞ.
3.3. A Lie group mapping between two points on the cone
Let us deﬁne a new vector

we obtain a quadratic equation for Z from Eq. (38):

and then from Eqs. (39) and (37) we obtain

Thus, between any two points ðu0; ku0kÞ and ðuf ; kufkÞ on
the cone, there exists a single-parameter Lie group element

where G is uniquely determined by u0 and uf through Eqs.

In practice, the data is attained by taking the sum of the
ﬁrst one hundred terms, which guarantees the convergence
of the above series.
The diﬃculty of this problem is stemmed from that we
attempt to use a smooth ﬁnal data to retrieve a non-smooth
initial data. In the literature, this one-dimensional BHCP is
called a triangular test [5,6,13]. For this computational
example, we have taken T = 1, Dt ¼ 0:01 and Dx ¼ 1=50:
The accuracy as can be seen from Fig. 3(a) is rather good
besides that at the turning point x = 0.5.
Muniz et al. [6] have calculated this example by diﬀerent
regularization techniques. They have shown that the expli-
cit inversion method does not give satisfactory results even
with a small terminal time with T = 0.008 [5]. In addition,
they have calculated the initial data with a terminal time
T = 0.01 by the Tikhonov regularization, maximum
entropy principle and truncated singular value decomposi-
tion, and good results were obtained as shown in Figs. 4
and 5 of the above cited paper. However, when we apply
the LGSM to this problem with T = 0.01, Dt ¼ 0:0001
and Dx ¼ 1=50; good result can be seen from Fig. 3(b).
In the case of considering the temperature obtained
through a measurement, we are also concerned with the
stability of our method, which is investigated by adding
the level of random noise on the ﬁnal data: hðxiÞ
½1þ sRðiÞ where we use the function RANDOM_NUM-
BER given in Fortran to generate the noisy data R(i),
which are random numbers in ½1; 1. The results are com-
pared with the numerical result without considering the
random noise in Fig. 4. The noise is obtained by multiply-
ing R(i) by a factor s ¼ 0:000039.

5. Conclusions
The backward heat conduction problems are formulated
with a semi-discretization version. In order to evaluate the
missing initial conditions for the quasi-boundary value
problems of the BHCP, we have employed the Lie-group
shooting method towards the time direction to derive the
algebraic equations. Hence, we can solve them through a
minimum solution in a compact space of r 2 ð0; 1Þ: Several
numerical examples of the BHCP were examined to ensure
that the new algorithm has a fast convergence speed on the
solution of r in a pre-selected range smaller than (0,1) by
using the minimum norm to ﬁt the target equations, which
usually requires only a small number of trials to select the
best r. The new method is robust to against the noise dis-
turbance. Through this paper, it can be concluded that
the new shooting method is accurate, eﬀective and stable.
Its numerical implementation is very simple and the com-
putation speed is very fast.

ther developed by Xiong et al. [25], of which the stepsize used in
the spatial ﬁnite difference is deemed as a regularization parame-
ter. Chiwiacowsky and de Campos Velho [26] have given a review
of the numerical solutions of the BHCP.
Clark and Oppenheimer [27] and Ames et al. [28] have used a
quasi-reversibility method to approximate the BHCP. The numeri-
cal implementation of the quasi-reversibility together with a time-
direction Lie-group shooting method has been carried out by
Chang et al. [7] to calculate the BHCP with a high performance.
However, when the ﬁnal data are almost diminished and are
polluted by a large noise, all the above methods may fail to recover
the initial data. In this paper we will extend the Lie-group shooting
method, which is used for the boundary value problems as origi-
nally designed by Liu [29–31] for the direct problems, to the BHCP
by considering a spatial-direction Lie-group shooting technique for
matching the boundary conditions. It is interesting to note that the
new method does not require any a priori regularization. It also
exhibits two advantages than other methods that the new method
is insensitive to the ﬁnal data and is insensitive to the noise distur-
bance. It means that the present method can be applied to retrieve
the initial data for a long history of BHCP with a large time span.
Through our study in this paper, it would be clear that the new
method can greatly reduce the computational time and is easy to
a numerical implementation for the calculation of BHCP.
2. Solution procedures
When the BHCP is considered in a spatial interval of 0 < x < ‘ by
subjecting to the boundary conditions at two ends of a slab and an
available measured datum at a ﬁnal time, we will solve it through
two steps. In the ﬁrst step we will develop a new shooting method,
namely the Lie-group shooting method (LGSM), extending the
works by Liu [29–31] from a two-dimensional shooting technique
to a 2n-dimensional shooting technique. Then, after searching the
missing left-side boundary condition at x = 0 we applied the fourth
order Runge–Kutta method (RK4) or the GPS to calculate the tem-
perature distribution inside the slab in the whole past histories,
including the initial one of u(x,0).

It should be stressed that the above G is different from the one
in Eq. (25). In order to stress its dependence only on y0 and y‘, we
write it to be G(y0,y‘), which is independent on r. On the other
hand, the G(r) is also a function of y0 and y‘, but its dependence
on y0 and y‘ is through the vector ﬁeld f and the mean values of
y^. However, that two Lie group elements G(r) and G(y0,y‘) are both
indispensable in our development of the Lie-group shooting meth-
od for the BHCP.

The above derivation of the governing equations (57)–(62) is
stemmed from by letting the two F’s in Eqs. (29) and (50) be equal,
which is essentially identical to the speciﬁcation of G(y0,y‘) = G(r)
in terms of the Lie group elements G(y0,y‘) and G(r).
Now, we can use the above equations to calculate the unknown
left-side conditions. Let us divide the problems into four types, cor-
responding to the four different boundary conditions given by Eqs.
(2), (4)–(6).
Problem 1. For this problem u0 = u(0) and u‘ = u(‘) are given,
while v0 = v(0) and v‘ = v(‘) are unknown vectors. Because of
v^ ¼ rv0 þ ð1 rÞv‘; ð65Þ
from Eqs. (61) and (62) we can solve
C.-S. Liu / International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer 53 (2010) 4132–4140 4135
by a black point. Under this r the left-boundary condition derived
from the LGSM provides the best match to the right-boundary con-
dition, and then we use the given u0 and the estimated v0 to calcu-
late the whole temperature and heat ﬂux of the slab. Because n is
quite large with n = 1000, and we use the L2-norm error in Eq. (69),
the mis-matching as shown in Fig. 1 is acceptable with a minimum
0.0779 at r = 0.774. For different problem the minimum of the mis-
matching error may happen at different r.
In Fig. 2(a) we compare the computed u(1, t) with the exact one
in Eq. (78), where we use the RK4 with Dx = 0.01 to calculate the
solution. Similarly, in Fig. 2(b) we compare the computed v(1, t)
with the exact one pcos (1.6p) exp(p2t) obtained from Eq. (80).
It can be seen that both the two numerical solutions match the ex-
act ones very well. The curves appear a large variation near the
time t = 0, which display a fast decaying of the temperature and
heat ﬂux when t increases.
Chang et al. [7] have employed a Lie-group shooting method in
the time direction for the BHCP; however, due to the steepest var-
iation of u it is required to consider a certain quasi-boundary reg-
ularization of the BHCP. The present method does not require to
consider any regularization technique.
In Fig. 3 we compare the initial temperature retrieved by the
LGSMwith the exact one. They agree very well. To the author’s best
knowledge, there has no report in the literature that the numerical
methods for this severely ill-posed BHCP can provide more accu-
rate results than the present one.
The numerical result under noise was compared with the
numerical result without considering the random noise in
Fig. 3(a). The numerical errors are presented in Fig. 3(b), which
are smaller than 1.5  102. It can be seen that the noise level with
s = 0.01 disturbs the numerical solution very small from that with-
out considering the noise. This shows that the present method is
robust against the noise, even the noise level is much large than
the datum itself.
The main reason for the better performance of the LGSM is that
we do not need to integrate this BHCP along the ill-posed direction
of time, and instead of we integrate along a non-illposed direction
of space, and thus the ﬁnal time data are just one boundary data set
for the totally 2n-ODEs. Especially, the latter fact explains why the
present LGSM is insensitive to the errors in the ﬁnal time data. This
point is very imporatnt for the practical application of the BHCP in
the industrial engineering, because we do not have a sensor that
can have such a high resolution to measure the temperature with
a quantity in the order of 1022. In practice, measurement noise
may be large with 0.01 or more large up to 0.1–0.5.
5.2. Example 2
In order to compare our numerical results with those obtained
by Fu et al. [22], let us consider a closed-form solution

The initial datum to be retrieved is given by

following test is done in the interval of x 2 [3,3]. In Fig. 4(a) we
compare the numerical solutions under s = 0 and s = 0.1 with the
exact solution, where T = 1 was ﬁxed. In the numerical calculations
by the LGSM we have used Dt = 0.002, and the stepsize used in the
integration was Dx = 0.0075. It can be seen that the numerical
solutions are very accurate even under a large noise, of which
the numerical errors as shown in Fig. 4(b) are smaller than
Fig. 1. For Example 1 we plot the error of mis-matching the target with respect to r.

ﬁnal data themself. In Fig. 6 we show the numerical results and
numerical errors, which are rather better with the maximum error
smaller than 0.04. When our method can retrieve the initial data
very well from the ﬁnal data which are almost invisible by the
computer machine, the other methods are all failue to treat this
highly ill-posed BHCP. To the author’s best knowledge, there has
no report that the numerical methods for this severely ill-posed
BHCP can provide more accurate results than ours.
6. Conclusions
The backward heat conduction problem is calculated by a formu-
lation with a semi-discretization of the heat conduction equation in
the time domain, and thus a 2n-dimensional coupledODEswere ob-
tained by subjecting to the four different types of boundary condi-
tions, which are dependent on the temperature or heat ﬂux
boundary conditions speciﬁed on the two sides of the slab.
In conjuction with the group preserving scheme we have devel-
oped a Lie-group shooting method in the spatial direction. By
employing the LGSM we can recover very well the initial data with
a high order accuracy. Several numerical examples of the BHCP
were worked out, which show that our shooting method is applica-
ble on the BHCP, even for the very strongly ill-posed ones. Under
the noisy ﬁnal data the LGSM was also very robust to retrieve
the initial data. The results were very signiﬁcant in the computa-
tions of BHCP because the LGSM is applicable for the case with
the ﬁnal data very small in the order of 1043 and the noise level
in the order of 101, and it still has the accuracy in the order of
102. The efﬁciency of the LGSM was rooted in its shooting direc-
tion of the Lie group that we used it to construct the numerical
method for BHCP. The BHCP is strongly ill-posed in the time
domain, but the spatial-direction shooting of the LGSM renders
the ﬁnal time data becoming immaterial, because they only inﬂu-
ence one equation of the many 2n equations. Therefore, the LGSM
can work very well for the large time scale BHCP and even under a
large noise level on the ﬁnal time data.

The Lie-Group Shooting Method for Thermal Stress Evaluation Through an
Internal Temperature Measurement
Chein-Shan Liu1
Abstract: In the present work we study numer-
ical computations of inverse thermal stress prob-
lems. The unknown boundary conditions of an
elastically deformable heat conducting rod are not
given a priori and are not allowed to measure di-
rectly, because the boundary may be not accessi-
ble to measure. However, an internal measure-
ment of temperature is available. We treat this
inverse problem by using a semi-discretization
technique, of which the time domain is divided
into many sub-intervals and the physical quanti-
ties are discretized at these node points of dis-
crete times. Then the resulting ordinary differen-
tial equations in the discretized space are numer-
ically integrated towards the spatial direction by
the Lie-group shooting method to find unknown
boundary conditions. The key point is based on
one-step Lie group elements: G(r) = G(y0,y).
We are able to search missing boundary condi-
tions through a minimum discrepancy from the
targets in terms of a weighting factor r ∈ (0,1).
Several numerical examples were worked out to
persuade that this novel approach has good effi-
ciency and accuracy. Although the measured tem-
perature is disturbed by large noise, the Lie group
shooting method is stable to recover the boundary
conditions very well.

Recently, thermally induced stress analyses with
heat transfer for several geometries and boundary

conditions have been solved numerically by many
researches, for example, Chen and Liu (2001),
Miyazaki, Tamura and Yamamoto (2000), and
Gulluoglu and Tsai (2000). Al-Huniti, Al-Nimr
and Naji (2001) have investigated the dynamic
thermal and elastic behavior of a rod due to a
moving heat source. They used an analytical-
numerical technique based on the Laplace trans-
formation and the Riemann-sum approximation
to calculate the temperature, displacement and
stress distributions in the rod. By using the
Laplace transform method, Grysa, Cialkowsky
and Kaminski (1981) have applied the thermal
stress theory to investigate the inverse problem
of finding temperature and stress fields from the
measurements of temperature, heat flux and dis-
placement at some points inside the solid. In or-
der to obtain a more accurate estimated result, the
measurement location should be located near the
position of unknown boundary condition. In ad-
dition, their estimated results were also sensitive
to the internal measurement errors and the mag-
nitude of time step. Blanc and Raynaud (1996)
have estimated unknown boundary condition of
an inverse problem by using the thermal strain and
temperature measurements instead of the temper-
ature measurements only.
For the inverse heat conduction problem (IHCP)
it is well known that the numerical schemes are
easily sensitive to measurement noises. In or-
der to overcome this drawback, Chen and Chang
(1990) have introduced a hybrid scheme of the
Laplace transform and finite-difference methods
to estimate unknown surface temperature in an
one-dimensional IHCP using the measured tem-
peratures inside the material without measure-
ment errors. Similarly, the measurement location
was better located near the position of unknown
boundary condition in order to obtain a more ac-

mal stress problem.
T (, t) = F(t) in Eq. (6), and that when T (x, t)
is not available in the whole spacetime domain
we have to solve Eq. (3), of which Tx(x, t) is as
a source term and there is also an unknown Neu-
mann boundary condition for u specified by
ux(, t) = kT (, t) = kF(t). (10)
Due to these difficulties, in the past studies the
measurement point is necessarily located near the
position of unknown boundary condition in order
to obtain a more accurate estimated result. On the
other hand, in the paper by Chen, Wu and Hsiao
(2004) the measurement point xm in Eq. (9) is lo-
cated at the left-boundary. From this condition
together with the condition Tx(0, t) = 0 in Eq. (6),
one really has a direct problem (not an IHCP) to
solve Eq. (5) by integrating it in the x-direction.
Then, it is not difficult to obtain the whole tem-
perature in the rod and moreover the condition
(10) can be available. Hence, we can treat the
wave equation (3) by using a general method for
direct problem to find the displacement and then
the thermal stress in Eq. (1). In this regard the
problem treated by Chen, Wu and Hsiao (2004)
under the condition of xm = 0 is not an inverse
problem, even they claimed that it is an inverse
thermal stress problem.
Here we are attempting to develop a new Lie-
group shooting method (LGSM) for the ITSP. It
is an extension of the works by Liu (2004), Liu,
Chang and Chang (2006a) and Chang, Liu and
Chang (2007a). Recently, Liu (2008a,2008b) has
explored its superiority by using the LGSM to es-
timate parameters in parabolic type PDEs.
The ITSP is one of the inverse problems for the
applications in heat conduction engineering by
considering thermal stress. The inverse prob-
lems are those in which one would determine
the causes for an observed effect. One of the
characterizing properties of many of the inverse
problems is that they are usually ill-posed, in the
sense that a solution that depends continuously
on the data does not exist. For the present ITSP
the observed effect is the temperature measure-
ment T (xm, t) made at an internal point x = xm in
the rod. We are interesting to search the causes
of these two unknown boundary conditions in
Eqs. (6) and (10), which induce the effect we ob-
serve through measurement. For the inverse prob-
lems the measurement error may often lead to a
large discrepancy of the causes.
The LGSM is originally used for the boundary
value problems as designed by Liu (2006a, 2006b,
2006c) for direct problems. However, these meth-
ods are restricted only for the two-dimensional or-
dinary differential equations (ODEs), and here we
will extend them to the multi-dimensional prob-
lems. In a series of papers by the author and
his coworkers, the Lie group shooting method re-
veals its excellent behavior on the numerical so-
lutions of different boundary value problems, for
example, Chang, Chang and Liu (2006, 2008)
and Liu and Chang (2008) to treat the boundary
layer equations in fluid mechanics, Liu, Chang
and Chang (2006b) to treat the Burgers equation,
Chang, Liu and Chang (2007a, 2007b) to treat
the backward heat conduction equation, and Liu
(2008c) to treat an inverse Sturm-Liouville prob-
lem.
It is interesting to note that the new method of
LGSM does not require any a priori regular-
ization when applying it to the ITSP, and also
exhibits several advantages than other methods.
It would be clear that the new method can
greatly reduce the computational time and is very
easy to implement on the calculations of ITSP.
Especially, when the thermocouple is mounted in
a position far away from the surface of unknown
boundary conditions for a safety reason, the
present method of LGSM would provide much
better computational results than others, which
in turns greatly suggest us to use the LGSM in
these calculations of ITSP when xm is limited to
be small for a safety reason.

(20)
where ‖y‖ denotes the Euclidean norm of y, and
A is an element of the Lie algebra so(2n− 2,1)
satisfying
Atg+gA = 0 (21)
with
g =

(22)
a Minkowski metric. Here, I2n−2 is the identity
matrix, and the superscript t stands for the trans-
pose.
The augmented variable X satisfies the cone con-
dition:
XtgX = y ·y−‖y‖2 = 0. (23)
Accordingly, Liu (2001) has developed a group
preserving scheme (GPS) to guarantee that each
Xk locates on the cone:
Xk+1 = G(k)Xk, (24)
where Xk denotes the numerical value of X at the
discretized point xk, and G(k) ∈ SOo(2n− 2,1)
satisfies
GtgG = g, (25)
det G = 1, (26)
G00 > 0, (27)
where G00 is the 00th component of G.
3.2 One-step Lie-group transformation
Applying scheme (24) to Eq. (20) with a specified
condition X(0) = X0 we can compute the solu-
tion X(x) by the GPS. Assuming that the stepsize
used in the GPS is Δx = /K, and starting from an
augmented condition X0 = ((y0)t,‖y0‖)t we will
calculate the value X = ((y)t,‖y‖)t at x = .
By applying Eq. (24) step-by-step we can obtain
X = GK(Δx) · · ·G1(Δx)X0. (28)
However, let us recall that each Gi, i = 1, . . .,K,
is an element of the Lie group SOo(2n− 2,1),
and by the closure property of Lie groups,
GK(Δx) · · ·G1(Δx) is also a Lie group denoted by
G. Hence, we have
X = GX0. (29)
This is a one-step transformation from X0 to X.
It should be stressed that the one-step Lie-group
transformation property is obviously not shared
by other numerical methods, when those methods
do not belong to the Lie-group types. This impor-
tant behavior has first pointed out by Liu (2006d)
and used to solve the backward in time Burgers
equation. After that Liu (2006e) has used this
concept to establish a one-step estimation method
to estimate the temperature-dependent thermal
conductivity, and then extended to estimate ther-
mophysical properties [Liu (2006f); Liu (2007);
Liu, Liu and Hong (2007)].
3.3 Generalized mid-point method
The remaining problem is how to calculate G.
While an exact calculation of G is difficult,
we can calculate G by a generalized mid-point
method, which is obtained from an exponential
mapping of A by taking the values of the argu-
ment variables of A at a generalized mid-point.
The Lie group generated from A ∈ so(2n− 2,1)
by an exponential admits a closed-form represen-
tation given as follows:
G =
⎡
⎢⎣ I2n−2+
(a−1)
‖ˆf‖2
ˆfˆft bˆf‖ˆf‖
bˆft
‖ˆf‖ a
⎤
⎥⎦ , (30)
The Lie-Group Shooting Method for Thermal Stress Evaluation 7
From Eqs. (50) and (52), the solution of Z is found
to be
Z =
(cosθ −1)‖y0‖
cosθ‖y0‖+‖y−y0‖−‖y‖ , (53)
and then from Eqs. (49) and (47) we obtain
η = ‖y
−y0‖
lnZ . (54)
Therefore, we come to an important result that
between any two points (y0,‖y0‖) and (y,‖y‖)
on the cone, there exists a Lie group element
G ∈ SOo(2n − 2,1) mapping (y0,‖y0‖) onto
(y,‖y‖), which is given by
[
y
‖y‖
]
= G
[
y0
‖y0‖
]
, (55)
where G is uniquely determined by y0 and y
through the following equations:
G(y0,y) =
⎡
⎣ I2n−2+ a−1‖F‖2 FFt bF‖F‖
bFt
‖F‖ a
⎤
⎦ , (56)
a = cosh[‖F‖], (57)
b = sinh[‖F‖], (58)
F =
1
η (y
−y0). (59)
η is still calculated by Eq. (54), which in view of
Eqs. (53) and (46) is fully determined by y0 and
y. Note that G is independent on .
It should be stressed that the above G is different
from the one in Eq. (30). In order to feature its
dependence only on y0 and y, we write it to be
G(y0,y), which is independent on r. Conversely,
G(r) is also a function of y0 and y, but its de-
pendence on them is through the vector field f and
the mean value of yˆ. However, that two Lie group
elements G(r) and G(y0,y) are both indispens-
able in our development of the Lie-group shooting
method for the ITSP.
4 The Lie-group shooting method
From Eqs. (13)-(16) it follows that
y′1 = y2, (60)
y′2 = h(x,y1), (61)
y1(0) = y01, y1() = y1, (62)
y2(0) = y02, y2() = y2, (63)
where y01 and y2 are known from Eqs. (15) and
(16), but y1 and y02 are unknown.
By using Eq. (19) for y we have
y0 =
[
y01
y02
]
, y =
[
y1
y2
]
, (64)
and further inserting them into Eq. (42) yields
F :=
[
F1
F2
]
=
1
η
[
y1−y01
y2−y02
]
. (65)
From Eqs. (54), (53) and (46) by inserting
Eq. (64) for y0 and y we can obtain cosθ , Z and
η in terms of y01, y1, y02, and y2; however, for sav-
ing space we do not write them out.
Comparing Eq. (65) with Eq. (35) and noting that
yˆ :=
[
yˆ1
yˆ2
]
=
[
ry01+(1− r)y1
ry02+(1− r)y2
]
(66)
by Eqs. (31) and (64), we obtain
y1 = y01 +
η
‖yˆ‖y

2−
rη2
‖yˆ‖2
ˆh, (67)
y02 = y2−
η
‖yˆ‖
ˆh, (68)
where
‖yˆ‖=
√
‖yˆ1‖2 +‖yˆ2‖2
=
√
‖ry01+(1− r)y1‖2 +‖ry02 +(1− r)y2‖2,
(69)
ˆh = h(r, yˆ1). (70)
The above derivation of the governing equations
(67) and (68) is obtained by letting the two F’s
in Eqs. (35) and (59) be equal, which in terms of
the Lie group elements G(r) and G(y0,y) is es-
sentially identical to the specification of G(r) =
G(y0,y).
The Lie-Group Shooting Method for Thermal Stress Evaluation 9
The material parameters used here come from the
work of Grysa, Cialkowsky and Kaminski (1981),
which will be fixed to  = 1 cm, G = 7.9461×
106 N·cm−2, ρ = 7.8 g·cm−3, ν = 0.3, αt = 1.2×
10−7 deg−1 and α = 0.119 cm2·s−1. Then c and k
can be calculated by Eq. (4). In addition these we
can compute the other constants by Eq. (84). The
final time is fixed to be t f = 2 s for this example.
Before employing the numerical method of
LGSM to calculate this example we use it to
demonstrate how to pick up the best r as specified
by Eq. (72). We plot the error of mis-matching the
target with respect to r in Fig. 2. It can be seen that
there is a minimum point. Under this r the left-
boundary condition derived from the LGSM pro-
vides a numerical solution to best match the right-
boundary condition, and then we use the given y01
and the estimated y02 to calculate the whole dis-
placement and stress in the rod. In the calculation
we were fixed Δt = 0.005 s and the stopping cri-
terion ε = 10−10 was used in Eq. (71).

two curves are almost coincident. Therefore, we
plot the numerical error in Fig. 3(b), which is
smaller than 8×10−8. Similarly, in Fig. 3(c) we
plot the numerical error of the normalized stress
σ/E, where E is the Youngs modulus. The error
is smaller than 10−7. It can be seen that our nu-
merical method of LGSM can be applied to the
ITSP.
In the above computation we do not consider the
noise disturbance on the measured data. When the
measured data T (xm, t) is polluted by noise, the
exact temperature field is naturally contaminated
by that disturbance. Hence, by replacing Eq. (16)
we consider
vi() = k[T (, ti)+ sR(i)], i = 2, · · · ,n. (87)
For the noised case with s = 0.01, we plot the

where T i(x)= T (x, (i−1)Δt) and Si(x)= S(x, (i−

Eq. (92) to increase the accuracy, we should use
the backward difference in Eq. (93) at the last time
point.
While the initial condition is given by Eq. (8) such
that T 0(x) is available, the two boundary condi-
tions in the interval of x ∈ [0,xm] are specified by
Si(0) = 0, i = 1, · · · ,n, (94)
T i(xm) = Fm(ti), i = 1, · · · ,n. (95)
If the left-boundary condition of T i can be ob-
tained, we can treat Eqs. (91)-(93) as a 2n-
dimensional coupled ODEs system, and use the
GPS or other available numerical integrators to
calculate T i and Si. And then inserting them into
Eqs. (13)-(16) we can calculate the ui and vi by the
LGSM as introduced in Section 4. Similarly, in
order to obtain the missing left-boundary condi-
tions of T i, we can apply the LGSM for Eqs. (91)-
(95). We directly write out the required equations:
y01 = y
xm
1 −
η
‖yˆ‖y
0
2−
(1− r)η2
‖yˆ‖2
ˆh, (96)
yxm2 = y
0
2 +
η
‖yˆ‖
ˆh, (97)
where
y1 :=

⎤
⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ .
(98)
The two known values are y02 = 0 and y
xm
1 , the lat-
ter of which is obtained by the measurement at xm
specified by Eq. (95). The η is similar to that de-
fined by Eq. (54) but with  replaced by xm. At the
same time ‖yˆ‖ and ˆh are also defined by Eqs. (69)
and (70) with  replaced by xm and with the above
y1, y2 and h.
For a specified r, Eqs. (96) and (97) can be used
to generate the new (y01,y
xm
2 ) until they converge
according to a given stopping criterion:√
‖y01,i+1−y01,i‖2 +‖yxm2,i+1−yxm2,i‖2 ≤ ε . (99)
If y01 is available, we can return to Eqs. (91)-(93)
and integrate them to obtain y1(xm). The above
process can be done for all r in the interval of r ∈
(0,1). Among these solutions we may pick up the
best r, which leads to the smallest error of
min
r∈(0,1)
‖y1(xm)−yxm1 ‖, (100)
since yxm1 is our target value at x = xm, wherein
we have made a measurement of the temperature
history.
6.2 Example 3
In order to test the numerical method in Section
6.1 let us consider
T (x, t) =
1√
1+4t
exp
(
− x
2
1+4t
)
. (101)
The initial condition is given by f (x) = e−x2 and
the measured temperature history at xm is exactly
given by
T (xm, t) =
1√
1+4t
exp
(
− x
2
m
1+4t
)
. (102)
For this example we fix the values of parameters
to be G = 2× 104 N·cm−2, ρ = 2 g·cm−3, ν =
0.3, αt = 10−3 deg−1 and α = 1 cm2·s−1 and  =
0.5 cm. The final time is fixed to be t f = 1 s. In
the calculation Δt = 0.01 s and Δx = 1/100 cm
were used.
We first suppose that the temperature measure-
ment is made at xm = 0.1 cm. In Fig. 5(a) we
plot the mis-matching of target with respect to r

x = /2 but with different times to the results
of Grysa, Cialkowsky and Kaminski (1981), and
Chen, Wu and Hsiao (2004).
As pointed out by Chen, Wu and Hsiao (2004),
the difference between the estimate by Grysa,
Cialkowsky and Kaminski (1981) and the exact
solution goes up to 13.3%. The present numeri-
cal method provides a rather accurate numerical
result with the accuracy in the fourth order. In
the estimation by Chen, Wu and Hsiao (2004) the
measurement is carried out at the left-boundary.
If so we can directly apply the RK4 method to in-
tegrate the heat conduction equation towards the
x direction. The accuracy may be increased to
the same level as that obtained by Chen, Wu and
Hsiao (2004).
6.4 Example 5
For this case we consider an unknown surface
temperature given by
T (ξ = 1, t∗) = t∗+ sint∗+cos t∗, (104)
where ξ = x/ and t∗ = αt/2 are dimension-
less spatial and temporal coordinates. In terms of
these coordinates, Eq. (5) can be written as
∂ 2T (ξ , t∗)
∂ξ 2 =
∂T (ξ , t∗)
∂ t∗ , 0 < ξ < 1, 0 < t
∗ ≤ t∗f .
(105)
Corresponding to the above surface temperature
the exactly measured temperature at ξm can be
obtained by inserting ξ = ξm into the following
