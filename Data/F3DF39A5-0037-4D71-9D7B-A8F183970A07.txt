singular order is concerned we cannot completely 
understand the fracture behavior of interface 
corners. To obtain full modes of stress intensity 
factors of interface corners, in the first year of 
this project we discussed which kind of interface 
corner possesses the most critical singular order 
that doesn’t correspond to full modes of stress 
intensity factors and presented a complementary 
definition for stress intensity factors to this kind 
of interface corners. Besides, to understand the 
fracture mechanism of viscoelastic interface corners 
more clearly, by combining the Stroh formalism and 
the correspondence principle between linear 
elasticity and linear viscoelasticity in the first 
year of this project we established a mathematical 
model to describe the general solutions of 
displacements and stresses for viscoelastic 
materials. Furthermore, by combining these general 
solutions and the achievement of the project [NSC 91-
2212-E-006-137] in the first year we also presented 
the analytical solution for the orders of stress 
singularity of the interface corners composed of 
viscoelastic materials. According to our original 
project, in the second year we modified the path-
independent H-integral for the calculation of the 
stress intensity factors under several different 
situations such as (1) traction-prescribed interface 
corners, (2) three-dimensional interface corners, (3) 
interface corners under thermal loadings, (4) 
viscoelastic interface corners, etc. Based upon these 
results, in the third year the stress intensity 
factors were calculated and verified under several 
different situations such as two-dimensional 
interface corners, three-dimensional interface 
corners, interface corners under thermal loadings, 
viscoelastic interface corners, etc.

this report.

1. Stress Singularity of Interface Corner in Anisotropic Elastic Materials 
The analytical closed-form solutions for the orders of stress singularity induced by 
anisotropic elastic interface corners have been obtained in our previous study [Hwu et al., 
2003]. Since the strain energy is bounded only the singular orders within the range 
0 Re( ) 1   is considered in our study. If c  stands for the most critical singular order, 
the terms associated with c  will dominate the stress behavior in the neighborhood of 
corner tip. As shown in eqs. (2.10a-2.10e) in [Hwu and Kuo, 2007], the most critical 
singular order c  may be one real simple root, or one real double root with two 
independent eigenfunctions, or one real triple root with three independent eigenfunctions, 
or a pair of complex conjugate roots, or the combination of one real simple root and a 
pair of complex conjugate roots, etc.. In other words, there are some cases in which only 
one or two eigenfunctions exist for the most critical singular order c . With this 
understanding, it is found that several combinations of interface corners will not possess 
full modes of stress intensity factors. Followings are some examples which have only one 
or two modes of stress intensity factors [Kuo and Hwu, 2010a]. 
 
Example 1: Special wedges yielding only mode I stress intensity factor. 
Since it is difficult to prove analytically which kinds of wedge combinations will 
yield only one or two modes of stress intensity factors for the most critical singular order 
c , the observation is made through several different numerical calculations. When a 
single wedge is made up of specially orthotropic materials whose principal material axes 
are aligned with the nature body axes of the problem like Figure 1a with 0  or 90     
and 0 , it is found that many zero components occur in the matrix of eigenfunctions, 
Λ , which will lead two stress intensity factors IIK  and IIIK  vanish. The same 
situation occurs for a bi-wedge composed of two unidirectional fiber-reinforced 
composites whose properties are the same but fiber orientations are opposite with respect 
to 1x -axis such as that shown in Figure 1b with 0     .  
 9
Example 2: Special wedges yielding only mode I and II stress intensity factors. 
When a single wedge is made up of generally orthotropic materials whose principal 
material axes are not aligned with the nature body axes of the problem like Figure 2a with 
0  or 90 , and 0     , or a bi-wedge composed of two dissimilar orthotropic 
materials such as Figure 2b or 2c with 0   , their most critical singular order c  may 
be a real simple root or a simple and complex conjugate roots. Therefore, for the present 
example the zero components in the matrix Λ  will lead to 0IIIK   if we concern only 
the most critical singular order.  
 
2. Stress Intensity Factors for the Lower Singular Orders 
From the examples shown in Section 1, we see that if only the most critical singular 
order of stresses is considered, certain modes of stress intensity factors will vanish. 
However, in practical applications the lost of certain modes of stress intensity factors 
does not mean that it will not fracture by that mode since the stresses associated with the 
next critical singular order may dominate the failure behaviour. With this understanding, 
sometimes it is necessary to compute the stress intensity factors associated with the lower 
singular orders. To provide a complementary definition for the stress intensity factors 
associated with the lower singular orders, the near tip solutions shown in eq. (2.1) in 
[Kuo and Hwu, 2010a] should be expanded to include all the possible singular orders,

In a fixed rectangular coordinate system ,  1, 2,3,ix i   let ( , )iu tx , ( , )ij t x , and

in Laplace-domain (s-domain) and can be determined by the Stroh sextic eigenrelation of 
anisotropic elasticity [Stroh, 1958;Ting, 1996], in which the fundamental elasticity matrix 
N is now a function of s whose based matrices Q, R, and T are three 33 real matrices 
defined by ( )ijklC s  instead of ( )ijklC t .  
By taking Laplace inversion of (7a), the general solutions of displacements and

It seems impossible to invert all kinds of functions by using the analytical Laplace 
inversion, particularly for complicated functions. Therefore, in our follow-up study 
numerical Laplace inversion will be considered, e.g. Schapery’s collocation method 
[Schapery, 1962] and Stehfest method [Stehfest, 1970]. 
 
4. Stress Singularity of Interface Corner in Viscoelastic Materials 
The boundary conditions for the interface corners in anisotropic viscoelastic 
materials can be expressed in Laplace domain as

Since the mathematical form of the basic equations (6), the general solutions (7), and the 
boundary conditions (11) are totally the same as those of the corresponding problem of 
anisotropic elastic materials, the solution for the viscoelastic interface corners should also 
preserve the same mathematical form as the solution for elastic interface corners when

Abstract 
To obtain full mode stress intensity factors of interface corners, in the previous year 
we extended the definition of stress intensity factors to lower singular orders. In addition, 
to understand the fracture mechanism of viscoelastic interface corners, the Stroh 
formalism for linear viscoelasticity has also been established in the previous year. 
According to our original project, this year we try to modify the path-independent 
H-integral for the calculation of the stress intensity factors under several different 
situations such as (1) traction-prescribed interface corners, (2) three-dimensional 
interface corners, (3) interface corners under thermal loadings, (4) viscoelastic interface 
corners, etc. 
 
Keywords: interface corner, order of stress singularity, stress intensity factor, anisotropic 
elasticity, viscoelastic material 
 
1. Modified H-integral – traction-prescribed interface corners 
According to the definition of the stress intensity factors, to calculate their values we 
need to know the stresses near the tip of interface corners. However, due to the singular 
and possibly oscillatory behaviors of the near tip solutions for multi-material anisotropic 
wedges, it is not easy to get convergent values for the stress intensity factors directly 
from the definition. To overcome this problem, several path-independent integrals have 
been proposed for the special cases of interface corners such as J-integral, L-Integral, 
M-integral and H-integral for crack problems. Since these integrals have a special feature 
that they are independent of paths, the complexity of stresses around the crack tip can 
then be avoided. The interface corners are usually in the status of mixed-mode intensity. 
 17
2. Modified H-integral – 3D interface corners 
Same as the 2D interface corner problems, in order to avoid the singular and possibly 
oscillatory behaviors of near corner tip stresses the most appropriate approach to 
calculate the stress intensity factors is via the path-independent integral. In our recent 
work, we derived a path-independent H-integral to compute the stress intensity factors for 
2D interface corner problems. Here, we like to extend our work to derive a 
three-dimensional version of H-integral to deal with 3D interface corner problems. 
In the absence of body forces, the reciprocal theorem of Betti and Rayleigh expressed 
in (1) can also be written as 
ˆ ˆ( ) d 0,ij i ij i jS u u n S =   i,j=1,2,3,                      (4) 
where jn  is the surface normal, ij  and iu  are the stresses and displacements of the 
actual system, while ˆij  and ˆiu  are those of the complementary system. S is any closed 
surface contour surrounding the corner front, which is selected to be  o c lS = S S S   
(Figure 2). oS  is a region on the plane 3 0x   bounded by '1 2, , , and RC C C C  with an 
outward unit normal vector )1,0,0( n ; lS  is a region on the plane lx 3  bounded 
by the contours similar to '1 2, , , and RC C C C  with an outward unit normal vector 
)1,0,0(n ; 1 2'c RS = S + S + S + S  in which ' 1 2, , , and RS S S S  are, respectively, curved 
boundary surfaces extended by ' 1 2, , , and RC C C C  from 03 x  to lx 3 . If we reverse 
the integration direction of RS   and denote it by RS  to conform with that of S , i.e., 
both of these two surface integrals are integrated from 03 x  to lx 3  and from the 
lower flank ( 0  ) to the upper flank ( n  ), the outward unit normal vectors of RS  
and S  will then be denoted by )0,,( 21 nn  and )0,,( 21 nn  . With o c lS = S S S  , 
21 SSSSS Rc   , the normal directions stated above, and the traction-free condition 
on surfaces 1S  and 2S , Eqn. (4) can now lead to

4. Modified H-integral – viscoelastic interface corners 
In a fixed rectangular coordinate system ,3,2,1, ixi  let ,  ,i iju   and ij  be, 
respectively, the displacement, stress and strain. The constitutive laws for the linear 
anisotropic viscoelastic materials, the strain-displacement relations for the small 
deformations, and the equilibrium equations for static loading conditions can be written 
as 
 , , ,1( ) ( )* ( ),    ( ) ( ) ( ) ,    ( ) 0,2ij ijkl kl ij i j j i ij jt C t d t t u t u t t           (15) 
where , , , 1,2,3,i j k l  and the repeated indices imply summation; a comma stands for 
differentiation; ( )ijklC t  is the elastic stiffness tensor whose components are also known 
to be the relaxation functions of the viscoelastic materials, and the symmetry of stress and 
strain imply ( ) ( ) ( )ijkl jikl ijlkC t C t C t  . In the first equation of (15), the notation of 
Stieltjes convolution has been used, i.e.,

Equations (18) are identical to the basic equations of linear anisotropic elasticity, which 
means that the viscoelastic solutions in the Laplace transform domain can be obtained 
directly from the solutions of the corresponding elastic problems with the replacement of 
the elastic stiffness tensor ijklC  by ( )ijklsC s

, if the boundary of a viscoelastic body is 
invariant with time. This statement is the so-called correspondence principle between 
linear elasticity and linear viscoelasticity and is applicable to anisotropic viscoelastic 
materials. Through the correspondence principle, we see that almost all the linear 
viscoelastic problems can be treated in Laplace domain by using exactly the same way as 
the corresponding anisotropic elastic problems.

previous study (Hwu and Kuo, 2007), to save the space of this report most of the details 
are omitted: Problem 1-3: cracks under uniform loading. Prob.1: edge crack under 
uniform tension; Prob.2: edge crack under uniform shear; Prob. 3: center crack under 
uniform tension. Problem 4-5: interface cracks under uniform tension. Prob.4: center 
interface crack; Prob.5: edge interface crack. Problem 6-7: notches under uniform tension. 
Prob.6: center notch with 3 / 2   ; Prob.7: edge notch with 3 / 2   , where 
1 0      denotes the notch angle. Problem 8: interface corners under uniform 
tension. The angle above the interface 2 2 1       , and the angle below the 
interface 1 1 0 5 / 6       . 
From Table 1 we see that the present results are well agreed with those presented in 
(Hwu and Kuo, 2007) for all crack problems (Prob.1-5), whereas for corner problems 
small difference occurs for certain cases. No matter which reasons cause the small 
difference between two unified definitions, through the comparison shown in Table 1, it 
is really hard to see the benefit of new definition except the unified unit. In order to see 
the necessity of the new definition, an example of interface corners has been done 
recently. From that result, we see no abrupt change occurs in the entire region for the 
newly defined stress intensity factors, whereas our previously defined stress intensity 
factors meet an abrupt change at the transition angle.

2. Application 2 – three-dimensional interface corners 
Consider a through thickness interface corner between one isotropic material and one 
orthotropic material subjected to remote tension (see Figure 1). The material above the 
interface is isotropic whose elastic properties are: 2.0 ,GPa10  E , while the other 
portion is orthotropic whose elastic properties are: 11 = 134.45 GPaE , 
22 33 11.03 GPaE = E = ,  1312 GG 5.84GPa, 23G = 2.98GPa, 12 13 0.301ν = ν = , 
23 0.49ν = . The boundary conditions used in the analysis are: 1 0u   on the surface 
1x d , 2 0u   on the surface 2 / 2x L  , and 3 0u   on the surface 3 0x  .

Triazine (BT) substrate, and their mechanical properties are shown in Table 2. Due to the 
discontinuity of geometries and/or material properties, stress concentration usually occurs 
at the corners or interface corners such as points A, B, C, D, E, and F shown in Figure 3. 
To know which corner is the most critical corner, we first calculate the orders of 
stress/heat flux singularity. Table 3 shows the results of singular orders of these corners, 
and point A is the most critical point.

Table 3. Orders of stress/heat flux singularity of the sample electronic package 
 
 
To study the effects of thermal environment on the stress intensity factors, we now 
consider two different thermal conditions: (1) the package is placed within an 
environmental temperature maintained at a constant temperature Tc, and the chip (silicon 
die) has a heat generation rate 10W; (2) the package is placed amid an environment with 
reference temperature 25 CrefT    before the chip begins to generate heat and the 
convection with heat transfer coefficient 2100W/m C  is imposed on all the outer edges, 
and the chip (silicon die) has a heat generation rate Q. It is assumed that this package 
doesn’t deform at 0 C . By using the modified H-integral proposed in the last year, the 
stress intensity factors associated with the singular order 0.28   of point A are 
calculated by varying Tc for the first case and varying Q for the second case. Figure 4 
shows that both of the mode I and mode II stress intensity factors vary linearly with 
environmental temperature Tc and heat generation rate Q. Note that the negative values of 
stress intensity factors come from the results that the values of the interface stresses r  
and   along AD are negative for the present examples.

Boundary Element Analysis of Unsymmetric Laminated Plates

ABSTRACT 
Among various kinds of boundary elements, the development of the boundary element 
for the laminated plates started relatively later than the others. Due to the complexity of 
the coupling effects raised by the unsymmetry of the laminated plates, most of the 
boundary element analysis published in the literature considered only the symmetric 
laminates. With the aid of the reciprocal theorem of Betti and Raleigh, the boundary 
integral equation for the coupled stretching-bending analysis was just derived recently 
[1]. To make the boundary integral equations work for the programming of boundary 
element codes, the fundamental solutions were derived on the basis of Green’s functions 
for infinite laminates. The explicit closed-form solutions of the Green’s functions have 
been found around a decade ago through the use of complex variable formalism for the 
general anisotropic plates. With the boundary integral equation and its associated 
fundamental solutions provided in the literature, the boundary elements for the 
unsymmetric laminated plates are developed in this paper. To deal with the possible 
singular problems raised by the nodal forces, two different methods are employed in this 
study. One is the analytical evaluations in the vicinities of singularity (called BEM1), and 
the other is the positioning of the source points outside the laminated plates (called 
BEM2). The verification of numerical results were done by comparing with the analytical 
solutions for the symmetric laminates, and with the numerical solutions for the 
unsymmetric laminates obtained from the commercial finite element software such as 
ANSYS. Due to the success of this work, like the two-dimensional problems discussed 
vastly in the literature it is expected that the same algorithm can be extended to the 
problems of the unsymmetric laminates containing inclusions, holes, and/or cracks 
through the replacement of the fundamental solutions. 
In order to demonstrate the validity and accuracy of the present works, comparisons 
have been done with several benchmark problems.The case shown below is a 
graphite-epoxy laminated square plate with the dimensions of 1m×1m×10mm applied by 
a uniform load of 6.9 kPa in its domain and the four edges are simply supported. The 
material properties of each lamina of the laminates are E1 = 207 GPa, E2 = 5.17GPa, G = 
3.1 GPa, and ν = 0.25. The stacking sequence of the unsymmetric laminates is 
[0/45/90/0/-45/90/0/45/90], whereas that of the symmetric laminates is [0/90/0/90/0]s. 
Eight linear elements per edge and 64 shell99 elements were used, respectively, for the 
present boundary element (BEM1 and BEM2) and ANSYS to simulate the problem. Fig.1 
is a contour plot for the deflection of the unsymmetric laminates, in which the solid line 
and dash line denote the results obtained by BEM1 and BEM2, respectively, while the 
color contour is superimposed via the output of ANSYS. Table 1 shows the numerical 
results for the deflection (wc) and inplane forces (Nx, Ny, Nxy) at the center point of the 
laminated plates (due to the page limit, the numerical results of bending moments are not

lems it is important to know the singular orders as well as their associated stress
intensity factors. However, due to the complexity of stresses near the tip of interface
corners/cracks, most of the existing calculation methods will encounter the problem
of accuracy and convergency. To solve this problem, several different approaches
have been proposed in the literature, such as (Raju and Newmann, 1977; Li, et al.,
1998; Labossiere and Dunn, 1999; Sukumar, et al., 2000; Ou et al., 2003; Shah, et
al., 2006; Sanz et al., 2007; Hwu and Ikeda, 2008; Attaporn and Koguchi, 2009).
In this paper, two approaches introduced recently will be discussed. One is the
improvement of the computational method for stress intensity factors by establish-
ing a path independent H-integral for general interface problems (Hwu and Kuo,
2007), and the other is the improvement of boundary element method by including
the fundamental solution of bimaterials.
In addition to the improvement of computational method for interface problems, in
this paper we like to emphasize the unified characteristics of the method introduced
here for the interface corners/cracks. In other words, the formulae and solution
techniques introduced in this paper are applicable for any kinds of anisotropic ma-
terials and piezoelectric materials, as well as any kinds of corners including cracks,
interface cracks, corners and interface corners. Moreover, through the modification
of H-integral, they are valid not only for two dimensional problems but also for
three dimensional problems (Kuo and Hwu, 2009).
2 Near tip solutions for interface cracks and corners
By employing Stroh formalism for anisotropic elasticity, the near tip solution for
interface cracks and corners can be written in terms of the stress intensity factors
as (Hwu, et al., 2003; Hwu and Kuo, 2007; Hwu and Ikeda, 2008)
u(r,θ) =
1√
2pi
r1−δRV(θ)< (1−δR+ iεα)−1(r/`)iεα >Λ−1k,
φ (r,θ) =
1√
2pi
r1−δRΛ(θ)< (1−δR+ iεα)−1(r/`)iεα >Λ−1k,
(1)
in which u and φ are, respectively, the displacement vector and stress function
vector; k is a vector containing different modes of stress intensity factors; (r,θ)
is the polar coordinate with origin located on the tip of cracks/corners (Figure 1);
the angular bracket <> stands for a diagonal matrix in which each component is
varied according to the subscript α , and the range of the subscript is 1 to 3 for
general anisotropic materials and is 1 to 4 for piezoelectric materials; δR and εα
are, respectively, the real and imaginary part of the most critical singular order
δc which is located in the range of 0 < δR < 1, and sometimes εα is also called
oscillatory index; ` is a length parameter which may be chosen arbitrarily as long

displacements in polar coordinate, and KI,KII,KIII and KIV are the stress intensity
factors of opening mode, shearing mode, tearing mode and electric mode.
3 Singular orders of stresses
The near tip solutions shown in eqn.(1) are the solutions associated with the singu-
lar order δ = δR + iεα , in which the singular order should be determined through
the satisfaction of boundary conditions for interface corners/cracks. By employing
Stroh formalism for the general multi-bonded wedges, the orders of stress singu-
larity can be determined by the following eigen-relation (Hwu, et al., 2003; Hwu
and Lee, 2004; Hwu and Ikeda, 2008), which is valid for cracks, interface cracks,
corners and interface corners, and the materials can be any kinds of linear elastic
anisotropic materials or piezoelectric materials.

in counterclockwise direction. For piezoelectric materials, the fourth component
of traction vector t is surface electric displacement and the fourth component of
displacement vector u is the electric potential.

5 Corner types – cracks, corners, interface cracks or interface corners
To show that the above formulae are valid for several different kinds of cracks and
corners, four examples are illustrated in this section. They are: a center crack in a
homogeneous anisotropic material, a center corner in a homogeneous anisotropic
material, an interface crack between two dissimilar anisotropic materials, an inter-
face corner between two dissimilar anisotropic materials. Although some typical
problems of interface cracks/corners have been presented in our previous paper
(Hwu and Kuo, 2007), for the purpose of comparison most of the examples illus-
trated in that paper are calculated for isotropic materials. To show that the formulae
and their associated solution techniques are valid for any kinds of anisotropic ma-
terials, here we like to extend the examples to the general anisotropic materials.
Moreover, to study the connection between cracks, corners, interface cracks and
interface corners, a particular problem is designed in Figure 1. From this Figure,
we see that when β = 0 the corner problems will be reduced to crack problems,
and when material 1 and material 2 are chosen to be the same material the interface
corners/cracks will be reduced to the corners/cracks in homogeneous materials.
Without loss of generality, in all examples the calculation of singular orders and
stress intensity factors is focused on the right tip of crack/corner.
Example 1: a center crack in a homogeneous anisotropic material
A center crack with size 2a in an infinite anisotropic plate subjected to remote
tension σ is a classical problem in fracture mechanics, which is usually used as
the first check for the advanced studies. It is well known that both of the singular
order and stress intensity factor of this problem are independent of the material
172 Copyright © 2009 Tech Science Press CMC, vol.11, no.3, pp.165-183, 2009
Again through the same solution techniques, the singular orders and stress intensity
factors of this problem are calculated as
δ = 0.5±0.063i,
KI = 0.180MPa
√
m, KII = 0.024MPa
√
m, KIII = 0.
which agree with the analytical solutions provided in (Hwu, 1993). Through the
comparison with example 1, we see that both KI and KII increase due to the differ-
ence of mechanical properties between material 1 and material 2.
Example 4: an interface corner between two dissimilar materials
Same as example 3 except that β = 30◦ for interface corner. The singular orders
and stress intensity factors of this problem are calculated as
δ = 0.473,
KI = 0.227MPa×m0.473, KII =−0.048MPa×m0.473, KIII = 0.
Again, like the crack/corner in homogeneous materials, by comparison with exam-
ple 3, we see that both of KI and KII increase due to the change from crack to corner
when they are compared under different units. However, unlike cracks in homoge-
neous materials or on the interface of bimaterials compared in examples 1 and 3,
through the comparison with example 2, we see that both the magnitudes of KI
and KII decrease instead of increase due to the difference of mechanical properties
between material 1 and material 2.
6 Material types – anisotropic or piezoelectric
To show that the formulae and solution techniques presented in this paper can also
be extended to the piezoelectric materials, the interface crack/corner between two
dissimilar piezoelectric materials will be discussed in this section through example
5. To see the piezo effects, examples 3 and 4 will be reconsidered by letting the
anisotropic material be the one of piezoelectric materials excluding the piezoelec-
tric constants.
Example 5: an interface crack/corner between two dissimilar piezoelectric materi-
als
Examples 3 and 4 are reconsidered here by replacing the anisotropic materials
with the piezoelectric materials PZT-7A and PZT-5H whose material properties
are listed in Table 1. For both cases, PZT-7A and PZT-5H with γ = 0◦ are em-
ployed to constitute material 1 and material 2 (see Figure 1), respectively. All the
other geometrical dimensions are the same as examples 3 and 4. A uniform remote
174 Copyright © 2009 Tech Science Press CMC, vol.11, no.3, pp.165-183, 2009
piezoelectric constants. By using the same formulae and solution techniques as
example 1, the singular orders and stress intensity factors of this problem are cal-
culated as follows.
Interface crack:
δ = 0.5±0.008i, 0.5,
KI = 0.177MPa
√
m, KII =−0.003MPa
√
m, KIII = 0,
which agree very well with the analytical solutions provided in the literature (Hwu,
1993).
Interface corner:
δ = 0.487,
KI = 0.210MPa×m0.487, KII = 0.012MPa×m0.487, KIII = 0.
Once again, like the crack/corner in homogeneous materials or lying between two
dissimilar anisotropic materials, the results of examples 5 and 6 show that both of
KI and KII will also increase due to the change from crack to corner when the plates
are made by the piezoelectric materials. Whereas the piezoelectric constants influ-
ence mostly on the appearance of the electric intensity factor, and have insignificant
effect on the magnitude of singular orders and intensity factors of stresses.
7 Problem types – 2D or 3D
Although the near tip solutions and the complementary solutions needed for the
H-integral (8) are derived based upon the assumptions of two-dimensional defor-
mation, it has been proved (Kuo and Hwu, 2009) that through the modification of
H-integral all the solution techniques can be further applied to the associated three-
dimensional problems. The reasons for this successful application are: (1) along the
3D crack/corner front each point can be treated as a tip of 2D crack/corner which
can be considered to be in generalized plane stress condition for crack/corner in the
outer portion and in generalized plane strain condition for crack/corner in the inner
portion; (2) besides the typical 2D stress/strain components, the additional third
directional stress/strain components such as σ13,σ23 and ε13,ε23 are all available in
the near tip solutions obtained by employing Stroh formalism for two-dimensional
anisotropic elasticity (Hwu, et al, 2003; Hwu and Lee, 2004).
Followings are two examples about the edge cracks in isotropic materials. One is
under plane strain condition, and the other is under three-dimensional condition.
To know the difference induced by the consideration of three-dimensional defor-
mation, same geometry and material properties are used in these two examples.
176 Copyright © 2009 Tech Science Press CMC, vol.11, no.3, pp.165-183, 2009
Consider a rectangular parallelepiped with a through thickness edge crack under
remote tension as shown in Figure 2(b) where the parameters a, t, h, and w are the
crack length, thickness, half height, and half width of this rectangular solid. The
remote tension σo is specified as 1MPa, while a is equal to 1mm. The other dimen-
sions of the specimen are a/w = 1, h/w = 1.75, and t/w = 3, where x3 =±t/2 are the
free surfaces. This rectangular specimen is composed of an isotropic material with
Young’s modulus E = 210GPa and Poisson’s ratio ν = 1/3. To have the same situ-
ation as the comparing published results presented by (Raju and Newmann, 1977;
Li, et al., 1998; Sukumar, et al., 2000), when performing the finite element analysis,
the boundary conditions are set to be u3 = 0 on the surface x3 = 0 due to symmetry,
while u1 = u2 = 0 on the line x1 = w & x2 = 0. Figure 3 is a plot of the normalized
stress intensity factor KI/σ0
√
pia versus the position of crack front x3/t. From this
plot we see that the present results well agree with the numerical results presented
in the literatures (Raju and Newmann, 1977; Li, et al., 1998; Sukumar, et al., 2000)
since all the deviations are below 4.03%.

9 A special boundary element for interface problems
Based upon the Green’s functions shown in (10), a special boundary element for in-
terface problems can be designed by following the standard procedure of boundary
element formulation (Brebbia, et al., 1984). To show the improvement of this spe-
cial boundary element, one typical example about the interface corners is presented
in this section.
Example 9: an edge interface corner between two dissimilar materials
Since the development of this special boundary element is for the improvement of
the computational accuracy and efficiency of interface problems, the example con-
sidered here is an interface edge corner (Figure 5) treated in our previous study
(Hwu and Kuo, 2007). The material above the interface is isotropic whose proper-
ties are: E = 10GPa and v= 0.2, and the material below the interface is orthotropic
whose properties are the same as those given in Example 1. The reference length
used in the definition (7) is selected to be b = 5mm.
The difference between the present example and our previous study comes from
the source of the displacement and traction vectors u and t of the actual system
needed in the calculation of H-integral (8). In our previous study u and t are calcu-
lated by the commercial finite element code ANSYS, while in the present example

Due to this difference we believe the present results shown in Table 3 is more accu-
rate than the one shown in (Hwu and Kuo, 2007). Note that in Table 3, r stands for
the radius of the circular path originated at the corner tip for the H-integral. In addi-
tion to the theoretical proof provided in (Hwu and Kuo, 2007), the path independent
property of H-integral can also be confirmed through this numerical computation
in which several different paths are used.

intensity factors of interface corners and cracks which are usually defined inde-
pendently can now be discussed and compared under the same situation set by
the users. By numerical examples shown in this paper, the combination of special
boundary element and the path-independent H-integral is also proved to be a good
approach dealing with the interface problem.

Multi-Order Stress Intensity
Factors Along Three-Dimensional
Interface Corners
Usually in the study of singularity problems, only the most critical singular order is
considered. For three-dimensional interface corner problems, if only the most critical
singular order of stresses is considered, it is possible to lose the opportunity to compute
the full modes of stress intensity factors. To fully understand the failure behavior of
three-dimensional interface corners, a definition of the stress intensity factors for the
lower singular orders is proposed in this paper based on that of the most critical singular
order. Moreover, to compute the proposed multi-order stress intensity factors accurately
and efficiently, a path-independent H-integral, which has been proven useful for the
two-dimensional interface corners, is now modified into a domain-independent
H-integral for the three-dimensional interface corner problems. Because the stress inten-
sity factors characterize the fracture behavior focused on an arbitrary tip along the
corner front, based on anisotropic elasticity the near tip solutions and complementary
solutions of two-dimensional generalized plane strain problems are introduced and then
utilized for computation of three-dimensional H-integral. To illustrate the validity of the
present work, several three-dimensional numerical examples are analyzed and compared
with the existing published solutions. Finally, two examples about the interface corners,
which occur frequently in electric packages, are solved to show the feasibility and prac-
ticability of the proposed approach. DOI: 10.1115/1.4000411

1 Introduction
The evaluation of the stress intensity factors for interface cor-
ners is required in many different engineering branches in which
the most representative one is electronic packaging. The natural
three-dimensional properties e.g., geometries, loadings, and
boundary conditions cannot be avoided when analyzing a case
realistically. Interface corners appearing in most engineering prod-
ucts may be formed by two or more dissimilar media especially in
electronic devices e.g., the corner placed in the solder ball, con-
ductive cooper, and printed wired board shown in the region
circled within the dash line of Fig. 1. A commonly used fracture
parameter, stress intensity factors SIFs, is treated as the assess-
ment of the fracture behavior for interface corner in this paper.
Based on the authors’ recent studies, it is found that several
combinations of interface corners possess more than one singular
order of stresses and the most critical one may be associated with
one, two, or three modes of stress intensity factors. Therefore, if
only the most critical singular order of stress is taken into account,
it is possible to lose the opportunity to compute all three modes of
stress intensity factors. Recently, Hwu and Kuo 1 presented a
unified definition for SIFs of interface corners and cracks. This
unified definition is merely correspondent to the most critical sin-
gular order of stresses. To deal with the case in which the most
critical singular order is not associated with every mode of SIFs, a
definition of the SIFs for the lower singular order is proposed in
this paper. This extended definition can help us fully understand
the failure behavior of interface corners.
In order to compute the SIFs stably and effectively, several
different path-independent integrals, such as J-integral 2,
L-integral 3, M-integral 4, and H-integral 5 were proposed in
literature to avoid the complexity of stresses around the crack/
corner tip. Because the mixed-mode characteristics and the avail-
ability of the near tip and complementary solutions of interface
corners, in this paper we adopt the H-integral to compute SIFs for
three-dimensional interface corners. Even if the H-integral was
proposed around 35 years ago, most of them were employed to
deal with two-dimensional problems such as 6,7 for 2D cracks
or corners in homogeneous materials and 1,8–13 for 2D inter-
face cracks or corners between two dissimilar materials. For three-
dimensional problems, Meda et al. 14 and Ortiz et al. 15 con-
sidered the applications to 3D cracks and solve different modes of
stress intensity factors by different H-integral. In this paper, a new
domain-independent H-integral is proposed to deal with all crack/
corner problems and all modes of stress intensity factors can be
determined simultaneously through one H-integral.
When employing H-integral to compute the stress intensity fac-
tors, the near tip solutions and their associated complementary
solutions for the considered crack/corner problems are needed.
Although no analytical near tip solutions have been obtained for
the general three-dimensional crack/corner problems, in this paper
the near tip solutions obtained for the generalized plane stress and
generalized plane strain multiwedge problems 16,17 have been
proven to be useful for the present 3D crack/corner problems. The
reasons for this successful application are 1 along the 3D crack/
corner front each point can be treated as a tip of 2D crack/corner,
which can be considered to be in generalized plane stress condi-
tion for cracks in the outer portion and in generalized plane strain
condition for cracks in the inner portion and 2 besides the typi-
cal 2D stress/strain components, the additional third directional
stress/strain components such as 13, 23 and 13, 23 are all avail-
able in the solutions obtained by employing Stroh formalism for
two-dimensional anisotropic elasticity 18.

Note that the near tip solutions shown above are not only valid
for the interface corners between two dissimilar anisotropic mate-
rials but also valid for those among with more than two materials.
The most critical singular order may be one real simple root, one
real double root with two independent eigenfunctions, one real
triple root with three independent eigenfunctions, a pair of com-
plex conjugate roots, or a combination of one real simple root and
a pair of complex conjugate roots, etc., 1. In other words, there
are some cases where only one or two coefficients exist for the
most critical singular order . For example, c10, 1=0, c2=c3
=0 if  is a real and simple root; c1 ,c20, 1=2=0, c3=0 if  is
a real and double root; and c2= c¯1, 2=−1, c3=0 if  is a complex
and simple root. In these cases, the missing eigenfunctions can be
selected to be the one orthogonal with the existing one or simply
taken to be zero. If they are taken to be zero, some of the matrices
composed of them such as V and  will contain one or two
zero columns and become singular and hence their inverse will
not exist in the common mathematical operation. With this under-
standing, if the inversion of such matrix is required, inverse it
only in its submatrix to avoid the problem of missing eigenfunc-
tions. For example,

a 0 00 0 00 0 0

Furthermore, sometimes it is not necessary to perform the in-
version if the matrix can be multiplied by its own inverse, e.g.,
r /−i−1=I when 1=2=3=0.
Based on the definition given in Eq. 2.3 and the explanation
of the inverse operation, it is found that several combinations of
interface corners will not possess full modes of stress intensity
factors. The following are some examples, which have only one or
two modes of stress intensity factors.
Example 1. Special wedges yielding only mode I stress intensity
factor.
Since it is difficult to prove analytically which kind of wedge
combinations will yield only one or two modes stress intensity
factors for the most critical singular order, the observation is made
through several different numerical calculations. When a single
wedge is made up of specially orthotropic materials whose prin-
cipal material axes are aligned with the nature body axes of the
problem such as Fig. 2a with =0 deg or 90 deg and 
0 deg, it is found that many zero components occur in the
matrix , which will lead two stress functions at =0 and two
stress intensity factors vanish. Their detailed zeros are as follows:
 =0 = 
0 0 0 0 00 0 0 , r,0 = 
0

0 , k = 
0

0  2.8
in which the symbol  denotes nonzero values.
The same situation as that of Eq. 2.8 occurs for a biwedge
composed of two unidirectional fiber-reinforced composites
whose properties are the same but the fiber orientations are oppo-
site with respect to x1-axis such as that shown in Fig. 2b with
0 deg. The most critical singular order  of each case dis-
cussed in this example is a real simple root and the inversion of 
in Eq. 2.8 is not necessary to be performed.
Example 2. Special wedges yielding only modes I and II stress
intensity factors.
When a single wedge is made up of generally orthotropic ma-
terials whose principal material axes are not aligned with the na-
ture body axes of the problem such as Fig. 3a with 0 deg or
90 deg and 0 deg or a biwedge composed of two dissimilar
orthotropic materials such as Fig. 3b and 3c with 0 deg,
their most critical singular order  may be a real simple root or
two simple complex conjugate roots. Hence
 =0 = 
 0 0 0 00 0 0 , if  is a real simple root

2D interface corner problems. Here, we like to extend our work to
derive a three-dimensional version of H-integral to deal with 3D
interface corner problems.
In the absence of body forces, the reciprocal theorem of Betti
and Rayleigh 20 can be expressed as


where nj is the surface normal, ij and ui are the stresses and
displacements of the actual system, respectively, while ˆij and uˆi
are those of the complementary system. S is any closed surface
contour surrounding the corner front, which is selected to be S
=So+Sc+Sl Fig. 4. So is a region on the plane x3=0 bounded by
C, C1, C2, and CR with an outward unit normal vector n
= 0,0 ,−1; Sl is a region on the plane x3= l bounded by the con-
tours similar to C, C1, C2, and CR with an outward unit normal
vector n= 0,0 ,1; Sc=S+S1+SR+S2 in which S, SR, S1, and
S2 are, respectively, curved boundary surfaces extended by C,
CR, C1, and C2 from x3=0 to x3= l. If we reverse the integration
direction of SR and denote it by SR to conform with that of S,
i.e., both of these two surface integrals are integrated from x3=0
to x3= l and from the lower flank =0 to the upper flank 
=n, the outward unit normal vectors of SR and S will then be
denoted by n1 ,n2 ,0 and −n1 ,−n2 ,0.
With S=So+Sc+Sl, Sc=S+S1+SR+S2, the normal directions
stated above and the traction-free condition on surfaces S1 and S2,
Eq. 4.1 can now lead to

In Eq. 4.5,  is the path emanating from 0 and terminating on
n in counterclockwise direction and S is the region enclosed by
the path  and the two free edges of interface corners. Equation
4.5 is the three-dimensional version of H-integral for interface
corner problems. Although similar formula of Eq. 4.5 has been
derived in literature 14, their H-integral was decoupled into
three expressions according to the mode of the employed comple-
mentary solutions and was applied to the crack problems only.
Here, the domain-independent H-integral, Eq. 4.5, can be ap-
plied to any crack/corner and interface crack/corner problems and
to solve any mode of stress intensity factors with the near tip
solution given in Eq. 2.1 or Eq. 2.6 or in Eqs. 3.1 and 3.2.
In order to use the domain-independent property of H-integral
to calculate the stress intensity factors, like the 2D interface cor-
ner problems 1 we first shrink the inner path C into the region
dominated by the singular field and make a judicious choice for
the integral path a circular counterclockwise path and the
complementary solution a near tip solution associated with the
singular order −1−R+ i. Along the circular path, the traction

numerical experiments there are still some cases of notches and
interface corners which have only two distinct real simple roots
associated with only two modes of stress intensity factors.
In the following examples, to calculate k through Eq. 4.9 or
Eq. 4.11, the stresses and displacements of the actual system
needed in calculating Hi of h from Eq. 4.5 are obtained from the
commercial finite element software ANSYS. For convenience, the
integral domain is chosen to be a surface bounded by a circular
path emanating from the lower crack/corner surface and terminat-
ing on the upper crack/corner surface, and the normal of this
integral surface domain is tangent to the crack front. Moreover,
the surface integral is performed through a two-stage numerical
line integral e.g., trapezoidal method or Simpson’s method with
respect to  and r one by one, i.e., dS=rddr. The two-stage line
integral means that we perform the integral firstly with respect to
 and we can get several results which are scalar functions of r;
then we proceed to integrate with respect to r and consequently
the surface integral is complete. Because the circular domain is
employed, the integration paths with respect to  are also selected
to be circular and pass through nodal points in our examples.
Since the numerical output will depend on element meshes and
integration paths, the convergent test and domain-independent
study were done numerically before performing all the following
examples. It should be mentioned that although the domain-
independent property of H-integral has been proven theoretically
in Sec. 4, when using H-integral to calculate the stress intensity
factors we still have to avoid taking the numerical results overly
close to the corner tip because of the incorrect stress information
in the neighborhood of the corner tip provided by finite element
analysis.
To avoid the incorrect stress information near the corner/crack
tip is the main reason why the path-independent integrals play
important roles in the computation of fracture parameters. To
show the difficulty of convergence through the conventional ap-
proach via the definition of stress intensity factors, an illustration
is given in example 5 for the typical interface corner problems.
Example 1. An elliptical central crack in a homogeneous iso-
tropic material subjected to remote tension.
First, we discuss an example about an isotropic cylinder with an
elliptical central crack. This example is a conventional 3D crack
problem whose singular order is a well known number 0.5, which
is a real triple root with three independent eigenfunctions.
Through relation 4.9, it can be calculated that

which shows that in general, no mode of the stress intensity fac-
tors will be lost if only the most critical singular order is consid-
ered, and hence it is not necessary to consider the stress intensity
factors for the lower singular orders. In Eq. 5.1, ij and Hij
 can
be calculated through Eqs. 2.4 and 4.7b in which the near tip
solutions  ,V and their associated complementary solu-
tions ˆ  ,Vˆ  have been provided in Ref. 1. Whereas Hi is
calculated through Eq. 4.5 in which u, t, and i3 are the dis-
placement, traction, and stress, respectively, of the actual system.
To obtain the data from the actual system and to compare the
results with the existing analytical solution derived by Irwin 21,
a finite element model of isotropic cylinder with an elliptical cen-
tral crack was constructed and executed using ANSYS. The numeri-
cal results of stress intensity factors calculated this way proved the
property of domain-independency and the accuracy of the present
method since the maximum relative error is below 0.5%, which is
acceptable. To save the space of this paper, the numerical results
are not shown here.
Example 2. A through-thickness edge crack in a homogeneous
isotropic material subjected to remote tension.
Consider an isotropic rectangular parallelepiped with a through-
thickness edge crack under remote tension. Since the local envi-
ronments of the edge crack and center crack are the same, the
relation for the previous example, Eq. 5.1, is still valid for the
present example. The difference in these two examples comes
from the external environments, which will be reflected through
the vector h containing the values of H-integral H1, H2, and H3.
With this understanding, a numerical example presented by Li et
al. 22, Sukumar et al. 23, and Raju and Newmann 24 for
edge crack has been done for the purpose of comparison and our
results agree with them with difference below 4.03%.
Example 3. A through-thickness edge notch in a homogeneous
isotropic material subjected to remote tension.
In order to accentuate that the proposed approach is not only
applied to the cracked problems but also suitable for the general
corner problems, a through-thickness edge notch in an isotropic
specimen under remote tension is considered in this example Fig.
5. The dimensions of the specimen used in this example are as
follows: w=1 mm, h=2w, t=0.7w, and =90 deg, which are the
half-width, half-height, half-thickness, and notch angle of this
specimen. The surfaces at x3= t are traction-free. The remote
tension o is specified as 10 MPa with =0 deg or =45 deg.
The Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio of this specimen are 210
GPa and 0.3, respectively. For the purpose of comparison, the
boundary conditions set in the analysis are as follows: u3=0 on
the surface x3=0 and u1=u2=0 on the line x1=w and x2=0 to
simulate the situation presented by Ortiz et al. 15. Note that to
prevent the rotation of the body induced by the inclined tension o
with =45 deg, the boundary condition u1=0 is set on two lines
x1=w and x2=0.0875w and x1=w and x2=−0.0875w.
When using the key matrix provided in Refs. 1,16,17 to solve
the singular orders for the present example, we obtain three dis-
tinct real simple roots, i.e., =0.4555, 2=0.3333, and 3
=0.0915, where each root is accompanied with only one real
eigenfunction. By Eqs. 4.9 and 4.11, we obtain

elastic properties are E11=134.45 GPa, E22=E33=11.03 GPa,
G12=G13=5.84 GPa, G23=2.98 GPa, 12=13=0.301, and 23
=0.49. The boundary conditions used in the analysis are u1=0 on
the surface x1=d, u2=0 on the surface x2=−L /2, and u3=0 on the
surface x3=0. The singular orders of this example are obtained as
0.46670.0367i and 0.4394 accompanied with one pair of com-
plex conjugate eigenfunctions and one real eigenfunction. Be-
cause the real part of the complex singular order is higher than the
real singular order, 0.46670.0367i will be treated as the most
critical singular order. To compute their associated stress intensity
factors, we use Eqs. 4.9 and 4.11 which can be shown as

nition 2.3 or 3.3, which will then encounter the convergent
difficulty. Figures 10a–10c are plots of stress intensity factors
KI, KII, and KIII versus the distance to the corner tip r /h. From
these figures, we see that the values of stress intensity factors
become unstable and cannot be convergent to a definite value, and
hence it is really difficult to terminate the approaching of r to
zero. This problem is due to the complexity and infinity of stresses
near the interface corners, which can be avoided in the calculation
through H-integral by using the path away from the corner tip.
Example 6. A representative block of electronic package sub-
jected to tensile loading.
For the purpose of giving a good connection between the
present method and the real engineering problem, a representative
block of electronic package is discussed in this example. Figure
11 is a quarter plot of the representative block in which the inter-
face corner between the solder ball and BT substrate is analyzed
to discuss the effect of the radius of solder ball B1 on the stress
intensity factors. The dimensions of each portion are also shown
in Fig. 11 in which B2=0.8B1 and B3=0.6B1. This discussion
is helpful to realize the relevancy between the radius of solder ball
and the reliability of electronic package. The boundary and load-
ing conditions are the entire bottom of the block is clamped and
the entire top is subjected to o=10 MPa. The properties of each
constitutive material are assumed to be linear elastic and listed in
Table 4. The singular orders are obtained as 1=0.4946 and 2
=0.3741, and each one is accompanied with only one real eigen-
function. By using Eqs. 4.9 and 4.11, we get

From Eq. 5.6, we see that if only the most critical singular order

next higher singular order is taken into account. However, the
values of KIII on the entire crack front are equal to zero because of
the axially symmetric properties of this example i.e., H1
2

Table 5 lists the trends of stress intensity factors versus radii of
solder balls from which we see that under the same loading and
boundary conditions the stress intensity factors will decrease
when the size of solder ball increases.
6 Conclusions
In this paper, the importance of the lower singular orders is
illustrated and a newly modified domain-independent H-integral is
proposed for three-dimensional interface corner problems. The
proposed definition for the multi-order stress intensity factors and
the three-dimensional version of H-integral are valid for cracks,
interface cracks, corners, and interface corners. The related mate-
rials can be any kind of anisotropic materials including the degen-
erate materials such as the isotropic materials. The most critical
singular orders induced by different combinations of interface cor-
ners can be a real simple root, a real double root, a real triple root,
a pair of complex conjugates, or a real simple root combined with
a pair of complex conjugates, etc. Similarly, the lower singular
orders can also have any different kinds of combinations. Even
several different kinds of combinations are considered in the
present paper, all the stress intensity factors can be determined
directly through the relation shown in Eq. 4.9. In this simple
relation,  and H are determined through the near tip solution
and its associated complementary solution, and hence will reflect
the local behavior of the interface corners; whereas h containing
the values of 3D H-integral will then reflect the effects of external
loading and structural geometry. Therefore, through the contents
of these matrices it is helpful for us to understand the details of
multi-order stress intensity factors for the general three-
dimensional interface corners. Detailed discussions for several
different kinds of problems have been presented in our numerical
examples, which show that our proposed approach is not only
versatile but also efficient and accurate.

Interface corners in piezoelectric materials
Received: 28 August 2009 / Revised: 3 November 2009 / Published online: 21 April 2010
© Springer-Verlag 2010
Abstract Through proper arrangement, the constitutive law, strain-displacement relation and equilibrium
equation of piezoelectric materials can be written in the same mathematical form as those of elastic materials
and hence Stroh formalism can be extended for piezoelectric analysis. Based on this viewpoint, the authors’
previous works for fracture analysis of anisotropic elastic materials, e.g. the eigen-relation for determining
singular orders, the near-tip solutions, and the unified definition of stress intensity factors for interface corners,
can also be applied to piezoelectric materials. In this paper, the theoretical framework of our previous works is
briefly introduced, and then an efficient and accurate computing method (H-integral) and its required auxiliary
solutions are derived for extracting the stress/electric intensity factors of interface corners made up of piezo-
electric materials. This theoretical framework and H-integral form a universal solution technique that is valid
for the fracture analysis of cracks, corners, interface cracks, and interface corners. Besides, the special cases
that suggest how we simulate elastic insulators/conductors from piezoelectric materials are discussed. Several
numerical examples are dealt with to display the feasibility and applicability of the proposed approaches,
and finally, a numerical example which exhibits how the electric load influences the fracture behavior is also
studied.
1 Introduction
Electronic feedback control has been widely applied to advanced control systems in which sensor and actuator
are two very important elements. Because of the electric–mechanical coupling effects, piezoelectric materials
are usually adopted as the constituents of the sensor and actuator. Besides, interface corners are very common
structures appearing within engineering objects, and interface cracks are special cases of them. Hence, the
fracture behavior of interface corners in piezoelectric materials is very worthy to be studied. Stresses and
electric displacements (or called inductions, electric flux densities) around the tip of corner/crack may exhibit
singular and oscillatory behavior due to the discontinuities of geometry and material properties, and hence lots
of failures initiate from this critical region. Orders of stress/electric singularity and stress/electric intensity
factors are two important indices usually employed to evaluate the degree of danger and the mode of fracture
within the category of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM).
In the past two decades, following the works of Kuo and Barnett [1], Suo et al. [2], Rogacheva [3] and
Ting [4], the extended Stroh formalism which satisfies the constitutive law, strain-displacement relation and
equilibrium equation of piezoelectric materials has been well developed to provide the general solution for
solving lots of two-dimensional electromechanical problems. Through this general solution, many researches
about fracture analysis of piezoelectric materials, which include analytical derivations or numerical treatments

and Re stands for the real part. The generalized displacement (or called electric potential) u4 is related to the
electric field Ei by
Ei = −u4,i , i = 1, 2. (2.4a)
The generalized stress functions φi , i = 1, 2, 3, 4 are related to the stresses and electric displacements by
σi1 = −φi,2, σi2 = φi,1, i = 1, 2, 3, and D1 = σ41 = −φ4,2, D2 = σ42 = φ4,1. (2.4b)
By using (2.4b), it can also be proved that the generalized stress function vector φ and surface traction vector
t possess the following simple relation:
t = ∂φ/∂s, (2.4c)
where s is the arc length measured along the curved boundary such that when one faces the direction of
increasing s the material lies on the right-hand side. From (2.4c), we have t = φ,r for a radial line surface and
t = φ,θ /r for a circular surface, and hence, the stresses and electric displacements in polar coordinate can
also be calculated from the generalized stress function vector φ by
σθθ = nT φ,r , σrr = −sT φ,θ /r, σrθ = sT φ,r = −nT φ,θ /r,
σθ3 = iT3 φ,r , σr3 = −iT3 φ,θ /r, Dθ = iT4 φ,r , Dr = −iT4 φ,θ /r,

3 Piezoelectric interface corners
Consider an interface corner between two dissimilar piezoelectric anisotropic elastic materials (Fig. 1). Assume
perfect bonding along the interface. The traction/induction and displacement/electric-potential continuity
across the interface can then be written as
u1(0) = u2(0), φ1(0) = φ2(0), (3.1)
where the subscripts 1 and 2 denote the values related to materials 1 and 2, and the argument 0 denotes the
values on the interface whose θ = 0. The two outer surfaces of the interface corner are assumed to be free-free
where “free” means mechanically free and electrically open (or electrically impermeable) and can be expressed
as
φ1(θ0) = φ2(θ2) = 0. (3.2)

3.2 Near-tip solutions
The displacements, stresses, electric fields and electric displacements near the apex of piezoelectric interface
corners can be obtained from the following solutions which sometimes are called eigenfunctions:
u(r, θ) = r1−δR V(θ) < r iεα > c,
φ(r, θ) = r1−δR (θ) < r iεα > c, (3.6a)
where
V(θ) = [η1(θ) η2(θ) η3(θ) η4(θ)],
(θ) = [λ1(θ) λ2(θ) λ3(θ) λ4(θ)], (3.6b)
and ηi (θ) and λi (θ), i = 1, 2, 3, 4 are functions related to Nˆ1−δk (θ, θk−1) and (Ke)k−1 [19]. In (3.6a), c is a
coefficient vector containing the coefficients c1, c2, c3 and c4 associated with the most critical singular order
δ = δR + iεα, α = 1, 2, 3, 4.
3.3 Stress/electric intensity factors
A proper definition for the interface corner has been proposed recently [17], which can be reduced to the
conventional definition for cracks in homogeneous anisotropic materials or for cracks along the interfaces
between two dissimilar anisotropic materials. Here, we extend this definition to the present cases of piezoelec-
tric interface corners, which can now be written as

in which  = (0) and  is a reference length employed to smooth the physical unit of k associated with the
complex singular orders. Their relation with the coefficient vector c is
k = √2π < (1 − δR + iεα)iεα > c. (3.8)
Using the relation (3.8), the near-tip solution shown in (3.6) can now be rewritten in terms of the stress/
electric intensity factors k as
u(r, θ) = 1√
2π
r1−δR V(θ) < (1 − δR + iεα)−1(r/)iεα > −1k,
φ(r, θ) = 1√

φ,r (r, θ) =
1√
2π
r−δR (θ) < (r/)iεα > −1k. (3.9)
From the examples given in [18], we see that if only the most critical singular order is considered, certain
modes of stress intensity factors will be lost even though the specimen is subjected to mixed-mode loading. The
missing modes maybe come from the stress/electric fields associated with the lower singular orders. Hence,
to provide a proper definition for the stress/electric intensity factors associated with the lower singular orders,
the near-tip solutions shown in (3.9) should be extended to include all the possible singular orders, i.e.,
u(r, θ) = u1(r, θ) + u2(r, θ) + u3(r, θ) + · · · ,
φ(r, θ) = φ1(r, θ) + φ2(r, θ) + φ3(r, θ) + · · · , (3.10)

in which (n1, n2) is the normal direction of integration path  and n3 = 0 due to the 2D feature. If the integral
path  is selected to be a circular path, we may choose the polar coordinate to represent the displacements and

H =

(ur σˆrr + uθ σˆrθ + u4 Dˆr − uˆrσrr − uˆθσrθ − uˆ4 Dr )rdθ. (4.6)
If the integral path  is selected to be a rectangular path, Eq. (4.5a) can be further reduced to
H =
∫
(u1σˆ12 + u2σˆ22 + u4 Dˆ2 − uˆ1σ12 − uˆ2σ22 − uˆ4 D2)dx
+
∫
(u1σˆ11 + u2σˆ12 + u4 Dˆ1 − uˆ1σ11 − uˆ2σ12 − uˆ4 D1)dy. (4.7)
Note that Eqs. (4.6) and (4.7) are reduced for the general two-dimensional cases whose u3 = 0 or t3 = 0.
Let Hi , i = 1, 2, 3, 4, be the value of H with cˆi = 1 and cˆ j = 0, i = j , and then the unknown coefficient

Combining the relations (3.8) and (4.8) will lead to

the following cases:

Fig. 2 An interface corner between two dissimilar piezoelectric materials
at any point within material 1 when P → ∞. Therefore, u4 should be a constant at any point within material
1 when P is large enough. On the interface whose θ = 0, we can obtain that
[u4(r, 0)]2 = [u4(r, 0)]1 = constant, (5.4)
through the use of continuity conditions (3.1), and this is the correct interface condition between an elastic
conductor and a piezoelectric material. It should be mentioned that u4 is directly assumed to be zero along
the interface to solve orders of stress/electric singularity in literatures [11,14]. The thoughts mentioned in this
section will be numerical examined in the fourth example in the next section.
6 Numerical examples
In this section, several numerical examples are presented to show the feasibility and applicability of the
approach proposed in this paper. First, an interface crack between two dissimilar piezoelectric materials is
analyzed for numerically checking the path-independent property of the H-integral. Then, a specimen shown
in Fig. 2 is designed to perform the remaining examples because an interface crack can be set by letting β = 0◦
for the interface corner, and a corner/crack in a homogeneous material can be set by letting material 2 be
equal to material 1. In all examples, the length W is fixed as 0.3 m while a and h may change according to
different values of β; along the vertical edge x1 = −a, due to symmetry the displacement in x1-dierction is
set to zero, i.e., u1 = 0; at the point x1 = W & x2 = 0, we set u2 = 0; a uniform tensile loading σ0 = 1MPa
is applied on both horizontal edges in which the lower edge is also subjected to a uniform electric flux density
D0 = 0.001C/m2, while the upper edge is electrically constrained by u4 = 0; the corner/crack surfaces
are electrically impermeable. In all examples, the 2D states of generalized plane strain and short circuit are
assumed, and the actual physical quantities for evaluating u and t are obtained from the commercial finite
element software ANSYS and a 2D 8-Node coupled-field solid element PLANE223 is adopted to perform the
analyses. In our numerical implementation, a convergence test is done and the element number is designed to
be 7,688 when β = 0◦, whereas lower element numbers are used for the other corner angle.

Example 1 Numerical check for the path-independent property of H-integral
To provide further evidence for proving that the H-integral is path-independent, we choose an interface
crack which is simulated by specifying β = 0◦ in Fig. 2 to perform the calculation. In this example, the crack
length a is 0.01 m and the ratio a/W is selected to be 1/30 to simulate an infinite domain. The material below
the interface is selected to be a piezoelectric ceramic PZT-5H, while the one above the interface is PZT-7A.
These two piezoelectric ceramics are both polarized along the x2-axis, whose material properties are given in
Table 1. Two circular paths with different radii (Fig. 4a) and four rectangular paths with wide ranges (Fig. 4b)
are chosen to perform the H-integral. Table 2 shows that the stress/electric intensity factors calculated through
different paths are almost the same as those calculated by the analytical solution for the infinite domain problem
[19]. Note that the mode-III intensity factor equals zero due to the 2D feature of this example and is not shown
in Table 2.
Example 2 Corners in a homogenous piezoelectric ceramic
This example displays the trends of stress intensity factors versus the opening angles of corners in a homo-
geneous piezoelectric ceramic. The homogeneous material is made of PZT-5H which is polarized along the
x2-axis to constitute materials 1 and 2 in Fig. 2, and the properties of PZT-5H are listed in Table 1. The
most critical singular order δ and its associated mode of stress intensity factor K I for corner β = 0◦ ∼ 80◦
are shown in Table 3. By following the suggestion made by Kuo and Hwu [18] we can find that δ for the
case β = 0◦ corresponds to all four modes of stress/electric intensity factors, while δ for the other cases
(β = 10◦ ∼ 80◦) merely relates to K I via checking the shapes of the matrix (0) and the generalized stress
function φ(r, 0). Consequently, we need to employ the lower singular orders to calculate the other modes of
stress/electric intensity factors. Except for the crack case, every case has totally four singular orders within
the region 0 < Re(δ) < 1, and δ(2), δ(3), and δ(4) correspond to K I I I , K I V , and K I I , respectively. However,
because of the 2D characteristic and the applied tensile loads, both K I I and K I I I equal zero for each case in
this example. The values of δ(3) and K I V versus different values of β are listed in Table 3. Through this Table,
we see that both K I and K I V increase due to the change from crack to corner and the enlargement of corner
angle when they are compared under different units. The correctness of the proposed approach can be verified
through the results of δ, K I , and K I V for the crack case β = 0◦.
Example 3 Interface corners between two dissimilar piezoelectric ceramics
In this example, we use the same material combination, boundary conditions, and loading conditions as
Example 1 but vary the corner angle within 0◦ and 80◦ to observe the influence of interface on the fracture
behavior of corners. During the numerical calculation, we found that when the corner angle is in the range of
10◦ ≤ β ≤ 80◦, the intensity factors associated with the most critical singular order δ consist of K I , K I I and

K I V without K I I I . However, for the interface crack β = 0◦, all four modes correspond to the most critical
singular order. Since the mode-III intensity factor always equals zero due to the 2D feature of this example,
we have no need to use the lower singular orders in this example. Table 4 shows the results of the most critical
singular order and its associated stress/electric intensity factors versus corner angle, from which we see that
the value of K I increases when the interface corner becomes wider, whereas K I I and K I V have no obvious
trends. So far not enough reference solutions have been presented; hence, we only check our results with the
existing solutions for the interface cracks. The comparison shows that our results agree well with the reference
solutions for interface crack. Note that the reference length  = 2a is selected for the interface crack because
its δ is a complex number.
Example 4 An interface crack between a piezoelectric ceramic and an elastic insulator/conductor
In this example, material 1 is selected to be an insulator epoxy or a conductor nickel, while material 2
is composed of PZT-4. All the boundary and loading conditions are the same as in Example 1. The material
properties of PZT-4, epoxy, and nickel are listed in Table 1 in which we let the dielectric permittivity tensor
ωεjk of epoxy and nickel to be the one of PZT-4 multiplying with the permittivity scaling factor P . Table 5
shows our results of δ, K I , K I I , and K I V for the interface crack between epoxy and PZT-4, and we can see
that the results become stable and close to the reference solutions when P is small enough. Table 6 shows the
results of δ, K I , K I I , and K I V for the interface crack between nickel and PZT-4. As P is large enough, this
Table exhibits that our results become stable and the stable δ agrees well with the reference solution.
In order to check whether our results can satisfy the correct interface conditions mentioned in Sect. 5, we
substitute the values of K I , K I I , and K I V obtained in Tables 5 and 6 into the near-tip solutions (3.9) and plot
the results in Figs. 5 and 6. Figure 5 shows Dθ (r, 0) versus r with various P for the interface crack between
PZT-4 and epoxy, from which we see that Dθ (r, 0) far away from r = 0 becomes more and more close to
zero when P decreases. Due to the singular behavior, Dθ (r, 0) increases rapidly when r approaches to zero.
Figure 6 shows u4(r, 0) versus r with various P for the interface crack between PZT-4 and nickel, from which
we see that u4(r, 0) becomes more and more close to a constant “zero” when P increases. The constant “zero”
comes from the boundary and loading conditions applied in Fig. 2. Through the data plotted in Figs. 5 and
6 and the comparison between our results and reference solutions shown in Tables 5 and 6, we can conclude

Fig. 7 Stress/electric intensity factors versus electric load D0 for interface corner β = 30◦ between PZT-5H and PZT-7A
κ-singularity (all singular orders are real). In other words, the classification of the singular orders depends not
only on the corner angle but also on the material properties. One may refer to [2,12,13,33,34] for more detailed
discussions on the classification of singular orders for an interface crack between two dissimilar piezoelectric
materials or piezoelectric/dielectric materials.
Example 5 Effect of electric load on the stress intensity factors
To study the effect of electric load on the stress/electric intensity factors, the interface corner is fixed on
β = 30◦ and the electric flux density D0 specified on the bottom edge (Fig. 1) is varied within −0.1C/m2
and 0.1C/m2, and all the other boundary and loading conditions are the same as in Example 3. Figure 7 plots
the values of K I , K I I , and K I V versus the electric load D0 and it shows that the stress/electric intensity
factors decrease linearly with D0. Based on this phenomenon, we may utilize the piezoelectric effect to accel-
erate or retard the mechanical failure of a specimen, or even design a specific electric load to produce pure
mechanical-mode fracture for the establishment of failure criteria in experiments.
7 Concluding remarks
A universal solution method which is applicable for the interface corners in piezoelectric materials is presented
in this paper. Through this method, the orders of stress/electric singularity and the stress/electric intensity factors
for cracks, interface cracks, corners or interface corners can all be evaluated through the same computational
approach. The feasibility and accuracy of this solution method can be seen through the numerical examples
shown in Sect. 6. Moreover, the path-independent property of the H-integral has been numerically verified via
several integral paths with different shapes and ranges for 2D piezoelectric problems. Besides, the special cases
which simulate elastic insulators or conductors via a simple simplification of piezoelectric material properties
are also presented in this paper. The interface conditions between a piezoelectric material and an elastic insu-
lator or conductor are also checked. Finally, via the last example, we see that stress/electric intensity factors
alter linearly with the electric load D0 and we may utilize this characteristic to make some special engineering
designs for advanced studies of piezoelectric fracture analyses.

Keywords: Interface corners, Orders of stress singularity, Stress intensity factors, Stroh formalism, 
Thermo-elasticity. 
Abstract. By employing the Stroh formalism for two-dimensional anisotropic thermoelasticity, 
fracture analyses of interface corners between two dissimilar anisotropic elastic materials under 
thermal loadings are considered in this paper. It was proved that the consideration of thermal effects 
will not influence the stress singularity but will induce heat flux singularity if the singularity of the 
temperature field is not permissible. To calculate the stress intensity factors via path independent 
H-integral, it was found that the one proposed previously for the mechanical loading conditions 
should be modified by adding an additional surface integral accounting for the thermal effects. Two 
examples considering cracks and corners in isotropic plates are presented to show the correctness and 
validity of the modified H-integral.  
Introduction 
Many engineering objects, e.g. electronic packages, engines of power vehicles, solar panels, and so on, 
are operated in thermal environments. It is known that the change in system temperature, the heat flux 
given on the object surface, and the heat generation inside the object can make the object deform, and 
hence the stresses will be induced when some restrictions on deformation are imposed, such as the 
clamped boundary condition or the perfect-bonded condition along the interface between dissimilar 
materials. Interface corners are the structures commonly appearing within the engineering objects and 
lots of failure initiate from these critical regions due to the discontinuities of geometry and material 
properties. Hence, fracture analyses for estimating the dangerous degree and the mode of fracture of 
interface corners in elastic materials subjected to thermal loading are needed urgently. Orders of stress 
singularity and stress intensity factors are two commonly used parameters when we perform fracture 
analyses within the category of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). This paper provides an 
accurate, efficient, and systematical solution technique to calculate these two parameters for interface 
corners between dissimilar elastic materials subjected to thermal loading. 
To understand the mechanical behavior of anisotropic elastic materials under thermal 
environments, Stroh formalism [1,2] for two-dimensional anisotropic thermoelasticity has been 
employed in many works. By this formalism, the analytical closed-form solutions for the orders of 
heat flux/stress singularity and the near tip solutions of the multi-material anisotropic wedges under 
thermal loadings have been obtained [3]. To understand the fracture behavior of interface corners, a 
unified definition of stress intensity factors connecting cracks, corners, interface cracks, and interface 
corners was proposed in [4]. In that work, in order to avoid the oscillatory singular problems of 
interface corners a path-independent H-integral was suggested to calculate the stress intensity factors. 
Based on these works, in this paper we try to extend the study of interface corners from mechanical 
loading condition to the thermal loading condition.

Path-independent H-integral for Thermoelastic Problems 
To provide a stable and efficient computing approach for the general mixed-mode stress intensity 
factors, a path-independent H-integral [7,8] has been proposed for either two-dimensional or three 
dimensional problems [4,5,9]. However, in those studies they consider only the pure mechanical 
loading conditions. For thermoelastic problems, by using the body force analogy [10], it can be 
proved that the following modified H-integral  is path-independent [11-13]:

flank 0θ  and terminates on the upper wedge flank 2θ  in counterclockwise direction and SΓ  is the

Conclusion 
An efficient approach to calculate the orders of stress singularity and stress intensity factors of 
interface corners between two dissimilar anisotropic elastic materials under thermal loading is 
proposed in this paper. A modified H-integral accounting for the thermal effects is suggested to 
calculate the stress intensity factors. Through the numerical examples shown in this paper, the 
correctness and validity of this modified H-integral are verified for the cases of cracks and corners.

mechanical behavior of anisotropic elastic materials under thermal environments, Stroh formalism [Stroh
1958; Ting 1996; Hwu 2010] for two-dimensional linear anisotropic thermoelasticity has been employed
in many works [Clements 1973; Hwu 1990]. By this formalism, analytical closed-form solutions for the
orders of heat flux/stress singularity and near-tip solutions of multimaterial anisotropic wedges under
thermal loadings have been obtained in [Hwu and Lee 2004]. To understand the fracture behavior of
interface corners, a unified definition of stress intensity factors for connecting cracks, corners, interface
cracks, and interface corners was proposed in [Hwu and Kuo 2007]. In that work, in order to avoid the
oscillatory singular problems of interface corners a path-independent H-integral [Bueckner 1973; Stern
1976] was suggested to calculate the stress intensity factors. Based on these works, in this paper the
H-integral is further modified to be suitable for the thermal loading condition.
The modified H-integral contains an additional domain integral that is not included in the H-integral
for pure mechanical loading. The integrand in this domain integral contains singular functions that come
from the strain components in the auxiliary system. Considerable numerical error will be induced if we
perform this domain integral via normal numerical methods, for example, Simpson’s rule and Gaussian
quadrature. To deal with this problem, the domain integral is separated into two parts. One is the
near-tip part, to be integrated analytically, and the other is the adjacent part, to be calculated numerically.
A similar approach has been proposed by [Banks-Sills and Ishbir 2004; Nomura et al. 2009].
Several numerical examples are analyzed for the purpose of verification: a center crack under mixed-
mode thermal loading, a center interface crack under uniform heat flow, edge interface cracks under
uniform temperature change, and interface corners under uniform temperature change. In addition, an
example about electronic packages is analyzed to show the feasibility and practicability of the modified
H-integral.
2. Thermoelastic analysis of interface corners
In a fixed rectangular coordinate system xi , i = 1, 2, 3, let ui , σi j , i j , T , and hi be, respectively,
the displacement, stress, strain, temperature, and heat flux. The heat conduction, energy equation,
strain-displacement relation, constitutive law, and equilibrium equations for the uncoupled steady state
thermoelastic problems can be written as [Nowacki 1962]
hi =−ki j T, j , hi,i = 0, i j = 12 (ui, j +u j,i ), σi j =Ci jksks−βi j T, σi j, j = 0, i, j, k, s = 1, 2, 3, (1)
where repeated indices imply summation, a comma stands for differentiation, and Ci jks , ki j , and βi j are,
respectively, the elastic constants, heat conduction coefficients, and thermal moduli. Ci jks are assumed
to be fully symmetric, that is, Ci jks = C j iks = Ci jsk = Cksi j , and are required to be positive definite due
to the positiveness of the strain energy. βi j and ki j are also assumed to be symmetric, that is, βi j = β j i
and ki j = k j i .
Consider an interface corner between two dissimilar anisotropic elastic materials (Figure 1) in which
a local polar coordinate system (r, θ) is specified at the corner tip. Assume a perfect bond along the
interface. The displacement, traction, temperature, and heat flux continuity across the interface θ = 0
can be written as [Hwu and Lee 2004]
u1(0)= u2(0), φ1(0)= φ2(0), T1(0)= T2(0), h∗1(0)= h∗2(0), (2a)

. (4b)
In (4), δ is the singular order and 0(θ), F(θ), and E(θ) are the matrices related to the material properties
and corner angles and have different expressions for materials 1 and 2 (given in the Appendix). The
eigenvectors associated with the singular order δ are w0 and v0, and can be determined by
K (3)e u0 = 0, φ0 = 0, v0 = 0, (5a)
where K (3)e is a 3× 3 submatrix of Ke defined by
Ke =
[
K (1)e K (2)e
K (3)e K (4)e
]
, Ke = Nˆ1−δ2 (θ2, θ1)Nˆ1−δ1 (θ1, θ0), (5b)
and Nˆ is the key matrix introduced in [Hwu et al. 2003]. In (4) and hereafter, the subscript k denoting
the values related to the k-th material is dropped to lighten the notation.
In (5a), the equalities K (3)e u0 = 0 and φ0 = 0 come from the traction-free boundary condition set in
(2b), and v0 = 0 comes from the requirement that the temperature is not allowed to be singular near the
corner tip. From (4a) we see that if v0 6= 0, both temperature and heat flux will be singular if the stresses
are singular. If the stresses are singular and the strain energy cannot be unbounded, only the singular
orders located in 0< Re(δ) < 1 are considered in this paper.
With v0 = 0, the near-tip solutions (4a) become
v(r, θ)= 0, w(r, θ)= r1−δE(θ)w0, (6)
which are the solutions without considering thermal effects. Since the singular order δ may be distinct
or repeated, real or complex, combination of all the possible solutions associated with the most critical
singular order whose real part δR is maximal leads, as in [Hwu and Kuo 2007; Hwu and Ikeda 2008],

In (7) the angular brackets

stand for a diagonal matrix in which each component is varied according to
the subscript α, for example,
<
zα> = diag[z1, z2, z3]; δR and α are, respectively, the real and imaginary
parts of the most critical singular order δc determined by (5a) with 0< Re(δ) < 1; l is a length parameter
which may be chosen arbitrarily as long as it is held fixed when specimens of a given material pair are
compared; V (θ) and 3(θ) are eigenfunction matrices related to E(θ)w0; 3=3(0), detailed expressions
for which can be found in [Hwu and Kuo 2007; Kuo and Hwu 2010]; and k is a vector containing different

∫
V (. . . ), j dV =

βi j (Tˆ i j − T ˆi j )dV = 0. (12)
In (12), 0 can be any positively oriented closed contour in a simply connected region. If 0 is selected
to be −0ρ +01+0R +02 and V (= VR − Vρ) is the domain enclosed by 0 (see Figure 1), due to the
traction-free condition on the corner flanks, that is, ti = tˆi = 0 along 01 and 02, (12) now leads to∫

∫
VR
βi j (Tˆ i j − T ˆi j )dV, (13)
which means that the following modified H-integral is path-independent:
H =
∫
0R
(uT tˆ − uˆT t)d0+
∫
VR
βi j (Tˆ i j − T ˆi j )dV . (14)
The superscript T denotes a transpose; 0R is a counterclockwise integral path with arbitrary shape which
emanates from the lower corner flank (θ = θ0) and terminates on the upper flank (θ = θ2); u and t are the
displacement and traction vectors of the actual system, which can be obtained through any method, for
example, finite element analyses, boundary element analyses, or even experimental measurement, while
uˆ and tˆ are those of the auxiliary system with singular order 2− δ.
In order to use the path-independence property of the modified H-integral to calculate the stress inten-
sity factors, we can first select 0R to be a circular path which passes the region dominated by the singular
field. Along the circular path, we have
t = φ,θ/r and d0 = r dθ;
and hence (14) can be rewritten as
H =
∫ θ2
θ0
(uT φˆ,θ − uˆTφ,θ )dθ +
∫
V
βi j (Tˆ i j − T ˆi j )dV, (15)
in which u, φ, i j , and T are the near-tip solutions given in (7), and uˆ, φˆ, ˆi j , and Tˆ are the auxiliary
solutions, which can be obtained by
uˆ(r, θ)= r δR−1Vˆ (θ)

r−iα
>
cˆ, φˆ(r, θ)= r δR−13ˆ(θ)
<
r−iα
>
cˆ, Tˆ (r, θ)= 0. (16)
Since the temperature fields in both the near-tip and auxiliary solutions are zero, the H-integral passing
through the singular field will be exactly the same as that for the pure mechanical loading problems.
Since the relation between the stress intensity factors k and the H-integral is obtained from the results
of the H-integral passing through the singular field, it can now be written by referring to the relation
obtained for the pure mechanical loading problem [Hwu and Kuo 2007], that is,

238 CHYANBIN HWU, TAI-LIANG KUO AND CHUN-CHIH HUANG
To evaluate (18) analytically for the part of Vρ , the auxiliary strain ˆi j obtained from (16) can be
expressed as
ˆ11 = i T1 uˆ,1, ˆ22 = i T2 uˆ,2, ˆ33 = 0,
ˆ12 = 12 (i T2 uˆ,1+ i T1 uˆ,2), ˆ23 = 12 i T3 uˆ,2, ˆ13 = 12 i T3 uˆ,1,

where
uˆ,1 = r δR−2(cos θe1− sin θe2), uˆ,2 = r δR−2(sin θe1+ cos θe2),

and

In (22a)–(22c), ρ is the radius of a small circle ahead of the corner tip. Since 0 < δR < 1 and
−1< Re(δh) < 0, from the results of (22a)–(22e) we see that the singular problem of (18) has been
solved through the analytical integration Iρ . To have a proper choice of ρ, the convergent test about ρ
should be done in a numerical calculation, which will be illustrated by an example shown in the next
section. Since the singular problem in the near-tip domain occurs from approaching zero distance, that
is, r→ 0, whether to obtain the analytical integration with respect to θ is not the main concern of our
study. Therefore, due to the complexity of γ (θ) and Vˆ (θ) in e0(ρ, θ), the analytical integration of Iρ
shown in (22b) is only for the variable r not including θ .
5. Numerical examples
To provide a stable and efficient computing approach for the general mixed-mode stress intensity factors
under thermal loadings, the path-independent H-integral proposed in the literature [Hwu and Kuo 2007]
has been modified by adding an extra domain integral as shown in (14). This integral is applicable to

and (20), for stress and heat flux singularity respectively. For points C, D, and E, whose corner edges
are not traction-free, related formulae can be found in [Hwu and Lee 2004]. From Table 5, we see that
point A is the most critical point.
To study the effects of thermal environment on the stress intensity factors, we now consider two
different thermal conditions: (1) the package is placed within an environmental temperature maintained
at a constant temperature Tc, and the chip (silicon die) has a heat generation rate of 10 W; (2) the package
is placed amid an environment with reference temperature Tref = 25 ◦C before the chip begins to generate
heat, convection with heat transfer coefficient 10 W/m2◦C is imposed on all the outer edges, and the chip
(silicon die) has a heat generation rate Q. It is assumed that this package doesn’t deform at 0 ◦C. By using

in which (r, θ) is the polar coordinate with origin
located at the corner tip, δα is the order of stress sin-
gularity located in the range of 0 < Re(δα) < 1, n is
the number of singular orders, f αi j (θ) is the nondimen-
sional eigenfunction related to the material properties
and corner angles of the bi-materials, and cα is gen-
erally treated as the intensity factor. Since the units
of the coefficient cα are of the form MPa(mm)δα , it
does not allow a direct comparison of the magnitude
of cα between two different interface corners unless
both corners have the same magnitude of δα . Especially
when the singular order is complex, the unit of cα may
become awkward (Rice 1988; Hwu 1993a). Because
the singular order δα may be real or complex, distinct
or repeated, its associated function f αi j (θ) is usually
presented in different form for different cases. Some
analytical expressions of f αi j (θ) can be found in the
literature for certain combinations of interface corners,
such as the interface corner of a scarf joint between two
bonded isotropic elastic materials (Qian and Akisanya
1999), the multi-material anisotropic elastic wedges
(Hwu et al. 2003), and the interface corner between two
dissimilar anisotropic elastic materials (Hwu and Kuo
2007), whereas some others are presented by the state-
ments of numerical procedures such as (Gradin 1982;
Groth 1988; Hattory et al. 1988; Reedy 1991; Pageau
et al. 1996; Koguchi 1997; Labossiere and Dunn 1999;
Barroso et al. 2009).
Since the study of stress singularity for the prob-
lems of interface corners started around fifty years ago,
numerous results have been published such as those
mentioned above for the description of scalar form
(1.1). An excellent literature survey has also been made
by Sinclair (2004) for the removal, interpretation, and
analysis of stress singularities. From these studies we
know that there are many differences and similarities
for the analytical expressions published for the prob-
lems of cracks, interface cracks, notches, and interface
corners. Thus, it is not easy or impossible to unify all
these analytical expressions by using only one scalar
form expression. Like f = kx to f = Kx for the analy-
sis of elastic bodies, in this paper we like to pursue the
possibility of using one simple matrix form solution to
express the near tip solutions for all the possible situa-
tions of interface corners.
As discussed in detail (Pageau et al. 1996) the def-
inition of factor cα published in the literature may be
distinguished by a multiplicative real constant (ampli-
fication), or a multiplicative complex constant (ampli-
fication plus rotation) depending on the real or com-
plex of the singular orders. When the repeated root
occurs for the singular orders, logarithmic singularity
exists and an adjustment is required in the standard
eigenfunction to insure bounded stress intensity fac-
tors. To have a definition consistent with the bi-material
interface crack and the homogeneous crack problem, a
standardization of ‘generalized stress intensity factors’
was proposed by (Pageau et al. 1996) for the general
n-material wedges and junctions composed of the iso-
tropic elastic materials. Recently, a unified definition of
the stress intensity factors for the general interface cor-
ners between two dissimilar anisotropic elastic mate-
rials was proposed by (Hwu and Kuo 2007) to build
a connection among cracks, interface cracks, corners
and interface corners.
Even, the standardization and the unification has
been proposed by Pageau et al. (1996) and Hwu and
Kuo (2007) for the interface corners composed of iso-
tropic and anisotropic elastic materials, respectively.
Two more issues discussed further in (Hwu and Huang
2011) will be considered in this paper. One is the
simultaneous consideration of different singular orders,
and the other is the unification of the unit of stress
intensity factors. Lack of these two considerations, the
stress intensity factors may encounter the discontinu-
ous change when the singular orders meet a type change
(e.g., from complex to real) or number change (e.g.,
from 3 to 2), and have the incomparable unit value
when two different interface corners are compared. The
matrix form near tip solution derived in this paper will
then be expressed in terms of the newly defined stress
intensity factors instead of the factors cα in (1.1).
When using the mathematical form (1.1), spe-
cial care should be taken when the singular order is
complex or the logarithmic singularity exists. More-
over, the singular orders δα and the eigenfunctions
f αi j (θ) cannot be written in one formula covering
all the possible cases of interface corners. Based on
the semi-analytical solution obtained from the scaled
boundary finite element method, recently Song et al.
(2010) proposed an interesting matrix power function
for the near tip solutions of multi-material wedges. The

where I is an identity matrix. u0 and φ0 of (2.2) are two
coefficient vectors related to the values of u1(r, θ) and
φ1(r, θ) at angle θ0, and can be determined through the
eigenrelation of singular orders, i.e.,
bonded: (Ke − I)w0 = 0, w0 = (u0 φ0)T ,
free-free: K(3)e u0 = 0, φ0 = 0,
fixed-fixed: K(2)e φ0 = 0, u0 = 0, (2.6)
free-fixed: K(1)e u0 = 0, φ0 = 0,
fixed-free: K(4)e φ0 = 0, u0 = 0,
in which K(i)e , i = 1, 2, 3, 4 are the submatrices of Ke
defined by
Ke =

K(1)e K(2)e
K(3)e K(4)e
]
, and Ke = (Ke)n
=
n∏
i=1
Nˆ1−δn+1−i (θn+1−i , θn−i ). (2.7)
It should be noted that if the singular order δ is a simple
root, the associated eigenvector (u0,φ0) is unique up
to a constant multiplier. If δ is a root of multiplicity m,
the eigenrelation (2.6) may or may not provide m inde-
pendent eigenvectors (u0,φ0). When the eigenrelation
cannot provide enough independent eigenvectors, the
missing eigenfunctions can be found by differentiating
(2.2) with respect to δ, which will provide the supple-
mented solutions with logarithmic singularity in the
form of (ln r)r1−δ , and will be discussed in Sect. 4.
If the singular order is a complex number, a conjugate
part should be superimposed to get the real values for
the generalized stresses and displacements. Moreover,
if one concerns not only the near apex field but also the
entire domain of the multi-material wedges, the solu-
tions corresponding to all the singular and non-singular
orders should be superimposed.
3 Near tip solutions for interface corners
The interface corner can be treated as a traction free
bi-wedge, which is a special case (n = 2) of multi-
material wedges. For free-free bi-wedge, the boundary
conditions can be expressed as
φ1(r, θ0) = φ2(r, θ2) = 0. (3.1)
The eigen-relation for the determination of the singu-
lar orders has been shown in (2.6)2. If the interface is
selected to be the line of θ = 0, the near tip solutions
(2.2) can then be reduced to
{
u1(r, θ)
φ1(r, θ)
}
= r1−δNˆ1−δ1 (θ, θ0)
{
u0
0
}
,
{
u2(r, θ)
φ2(r, θ)
}
= r1−δNˆ1−δ2 (θ, 0)Nˆ1−δ1 (0, θ0)
{
u0
0
}
.
(3.2)
For the convenience of later discussion, we now let
Nˆ1−δ1 (θ, θ0) =
[
U(θ) Uφ(θ)
(θ) φ(θ)
]
,
(3.3)
Nˆ1−δ2 (θ, 0)Nˆ
1−δ
1 (0, θ0) =
[
U∗(θ) U∗φ(θ)
∗(θ) ∗φ(θ)
]
,
in which φ(θ) = UT (θ), and the explicit form of the
submatrices U(θ), . . . ,∗(θ) can be obtained by using
the relations (B.2) given in “Appendix B”. Substituting
(3.3) into (3.2), the near tip solutions can be rewritten
as
u1(r, θ) = r1−δU(θ)u0, φ1(r, θ) = r1−δ(θ)u0,
(3.4)
u2(r, θ) = r1−δU∗(θ)u0, φ2(r, θ) = r1−δ∗(θ)u0,
in which the singular order δ and its associated eigen-
vector u0 are determined from
∗(θ2)u0 = 0. (3.5)
By letting u0 = c−1(0)λ/(1−δ) where c is a scaling
factor, Eq. (3.4) can be expressed as
u(r, θ) = cr
1−δ
1 − δ η(θ), φ(r, θ) =
cr1−δ
1 − δ λ(θ), (3.6a)
where
η(θ) =
{
U(θ)−1(0)λ, when θ0 ≤ θ ≤ 0
U∗(θ)−1(0)λ, when 0 ≤ θ ≤ θ2 ,
λ(θ) =
{
(θ)−1(0)λ, when θ0 ≤ θ ≤ 0
∗(θ)−1(0)λ, when 0 ≤ θ ≤ θ2 .
(3.6b)
δ and λ are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the
following eigen-relation,
[∗(θ2)−1(0)]λ = 0. (3.7)
Note that U(0) = U∗(0),(0) = ∗(0) due to the
continuity of displacements and tractions across the
interface θ = 0, and λ(0) = λ.
Since the characteristic equation of the eigen-rela-
tion (3.7) is a transcendental function of δ, it may have
infinite number of eigenvalues. However, if only the

(3.11) should be modified as follows.
Case 1. δ1 = δ2, λ1(θ) = λ2(θ):
φ,r (r, θ) = c1r−δ1λ1(θ)

{

}
+c3r−δ3λ3(θ), (4.1a)
or in matrix form,
φ,r (r, θ) = ˙(θ)〈r−δα 〉˙c. (4.1b)
Case 2. δ1 = δ2 = δ3, λ1(θ) = λ2(θ) = λ3(θ):
φ,r (r, θ) = c1r−δ1λ1(θ)

, (4.2a)
or in matrix form,
φ,r (r, θ) = ¨(θ)〈r−δα 〉¨c. (4.2b)
Thus, the near tip solutions for cases with logarithmic
singularity can be expressed as
Case 1: u(r, θ) = V˙(θ) r
1−δα
1 − δα c˙,
φ(r, θ) = ˙(θ)

σ (r, θ) = (θ)¨(θ)

In the above, V˙(θ), V¨(θ), ˙(θ), and ¨(θ) are
defined by
V˙(θ) = [η1(θ) η˙1(θ) η3(θ)],
V¨(θ) = [η1(θ) η˙1(θ) η¨1(θ)],
˙(θ) = [λ1(θ) λ˙1(θ) λ3(θ)], (4.4a)
¨(θ) = [λ1(θ) λ˙1(θ) λ¨1(θ)],
where

The symbols with the forms of 〈 fα 〉˙ and 〈 fα 〉¨ are
defined as

5 Stress intensity factors
From the discussions of the previous two sections, we
see that the mathematical expressions of the near tip
solutions for distinct singular orders or repeated sin-
gular orders can all be organized into the same matrix
forms distinguished by the over dot •˙ or over double
dot •¨ on the eigenfunction matrices V, and diago-
nal matrices 〈•〉. Therefore, to simplify our following
discussions only the cases with distinct eigenfunctions
will be shown and all the other cases can be obtained
automatically just replacing V, and 〈•〉 by V˙, ˙ and
〈•〉˙ for case 1, or by V¨, ¨ and 〈•〉¨ for case 2 of Sect. 4.
Through the near tip solutions shown in (3.11), it is
observed that the coefficients c1, c2 and c3 are the sca-
lars measuring the intensity of stress singularity, and
may be treated as stress intensity factors. However,
due to the unit and direction problems, they are not
good candidates for the definition of stress intensity
factors. To have a proper unified definition applicable
for all possible cases of interface corners (including
cracks, interface cracks, corners and interface corners),
recently a new definition of the stress intensity factors
k has been proposed (Hwu and Huang 2011), which is
related to the coefficient c by
k =

It can be proved that the maximum stress intensity fac-
tor of opening mode occurs at the radial direction θ =
θp where K I I (θp) = 0, i.e.,
cos
θp
2
= 0 or
K I sin θp + K I I (3 cos θp − 1) = 0. (5.11)
If the crack propagates when the maximum stress inten-
sity factor of opening mode exceeds its critical value,
i.e.,
K pI = K I (θp) =
1
2
cos
θp
2
× [K I (1 + cos θp) − 3K I I sin θp
] = K pI C ,
(5.12)
where K pI C is the critical principal stress intensity
factor, a fracture criterion identical to the maximum
tangential stress criterion (Erdogan and Sih 1963) is
obtained. This is reasonable and expected since K pI
represents the intensity of singularity of the maximum
tangential stress.
Use of the matrix form near tip solution shown in
(5.2), one may get a matrix form expression for the
strain energy density near the corner tip. Through this
unified matrix form expression, it is possible to explore
the applicability of strain energy density criterion (Sih
1974) to the general problems of interface corners.
It is known that Sih’s criterion is based on the strain
energy density factor S, which is a point-related crite-
rion and the direction of crack propagation was deter-
mined by imposing a minimum condition on S. On the
contrary, a finite-volume-energy based approach was
proposed by Lazzarin and Zambardi (2001) and used
in the problems of welded joints (Lazzarin et al. 2008)
and V-notches (Harding et al. 2010). In their approach,
the mean value of strain energy in the control volume
surrounding the corner tip is calculated first, and then
compared with a limit value. With the matrix form near
tip solution (5.2) and the derivation procedure stated in
(Lazzarin and Zambardi 2001), it is also possible to get
an expression of radius of control volume in terms of
the newly defined stress intensity factors (5.3) for the
general multi-material problems.
6 Matrix power function form solutions
If the stress intensity factors k(θ) are defined based
upon the radial direction θ = constant of the point
(r, θ) near the corner tip, substituting (5.7a) into (5.2)3
we get
σ (r, θ) = 1√
2π
(r/)−(θ)k(θ), (6.1)
where (θ) is the matrix of singular orders at angle θ
defined by
(θ) = ∗(θ)〈δα〉∗−1(θ), ∗(θ) = (θ)(θ)
(6.2)
and the matrix power function (r/)−(θ) can be cal-
culated by
(r/)−(θ) = ∗(θ)〈(r/)−δα 〉∗−1(θ). (6.3)

shown in (A.3), it can be proved that (0) and ∗(π)

)
= D − iW, (7.4b)
and
D = L−11 + L−12 , W = S1L−11 − S2L−12 . (7.4c)
Due to the positive definiteness of L2 and the nonzero
of (sin δπ)e−iδπ for 0 < Re(δ) < 1, use of the results
(7.4a) will further reduce the eigen-relation (3.7) to
(M∗ + e2iδπM¯∗)λ = 0. (7.5)
The singular orders δα, α = 1, 2, 3 and their associated
eigenfunction matrix  = [λ1 λ2 λ3] deriving from
(7.5) for orthotropic bi-materials have been obtained
by Ting (1986) and Hwu (1993b) as

To derive the scalar form near tip solutions of dis-
placements and stresses along any other radial direc-
tion, we need to find the eigenfunctions at angle θ from

the general cases of anisotropic materials, the complete

Substituting (7.15b) and (7.16b) into the eigen-rela-
tion (3.7), we can get the solutions of singular orders δα
and eigenfunctionsλα for the problems of interface cor-
ners between two dissimilar isotropic materials. Since
it is too complicated to write down the explicit solu-
tions of δα and λα for the general cases of interface
corners, in the following we consider the general cases
of interface cracks.
7.2.1 Interface cracks
For the problems of interface cracks, θ0 = −π, θ1 = 0
and θ2 = π . With these values and the results of (7.15b)
and (7.16b), the eigen-relation (3.7) now becomes

(7.18)
From (7.18), the singular orders δα and eigenfunctions
λα for the interface cracks between two dissimilar iso-
tropic materials can be obtained as

. (7.19b)
This result can easily be verified by substituting ρ1 and
ρ3 of (7.17) into (7.19b), and reducing (7.7) to isotropic
bimaterials.
After getting the eigenfunctions λα at angle θ = 0,
the eigenfunctions λα(θ) at angle θ can be derived from
(3.6b)2 by using (7.19a), (7.15b) and (7.16b). Through
proper mathematical manipulation, the explicit solu-
tions of λα(θ) can be expressed as

The material eigen-relation can also be written in the

Q(θ), R(θ), T(θ) are related to Q, R and T by
Q(θ) = Q cos2 θ + (R + RT ) sin θ cos θ + T sin2 θ,
R(θ) = R cos2 θ + (T − Q) sin θ cos θ − RT sin2 θ,
T(θ) = T cos2 θ − (R + RT ) sin θ cos θ + Q sin2 θ.

Appendix B: Key matrix Nˆ(θ, ω)
The key matrix Nˆ(θ, ω) introduced in (Hwu et al. 2003)
is related to the 6×6 generalized fundamental elasticity
matrix N(ω) by (Hwu 2010; Ting 1996)
Nˆ(θ, ω) = cos(θ − ω)I + sin(θ − ω)N(ω). (B.1)
Through the material eigen-relation (A.6), it can be
shown that the (1 − δ)th power of the key matrix can
be diagonalized as follows:
(i) When N is simple or semisimple, i.e., its eigen-
vectors, (aα, bα), α = 1, 2, 3, are independent
of each other, (Hwu 2010)

unit for the stress intensity factors is the best way to build a connection among cracks, interface cracks, corners and interface
corners even their singular orders may have different types. With this consideration, the standardization and uniﬁcation of
the stress intensity factors were proposed by Pageau et al. [1] and Hwu and Kuo [2] for interface corners composed of iso-
tropic and anisotropic elastic materials, respectively. In real applications, it was found that the deﬁnitions they proposed
have different units for different interface corners and cannot cover different singular orders simultaneously [3]. To have
a deﬁnition covering all different singular orders simultaneously, Nomura et al. [4] modiﬁed slightly the deﬁnition proposed
by Hwu and Kuo [2]. To have a deﬁnition covering all different types of singularities, Song et al. [5] proposed a deﬁnition with
matrix power function form in which the matrix of singular orders is calculated through the scaled boundary ﬁnite element
solution. These deﬁnitions have different appearances. In most cases they provide the same results, however, in some cases
they are different. Since the uniﬁed characteristics is important and valuable for the further study of interface corners, the
detailed discussion and comparison among the deﬁnitions proposed in [2–5] will be presented in this paper.
In order to investigate the stress intensity factors of interface corners, the matrix form solutions of stresses near the tip of
interface corners [6] are introduced in Section 2. Based upon the near tip solutions of stresses, the deﬁnitions of stress inten-
sity factors for cracks, interface cracks, corners and interface corners are presented and discussed in Section 3. Since a new
deﬁnition of stress intensity factor is proposed in Section 3, to calculate this factor accurately and efﬁciently, a new relation
between H-integral and the stress intensity factors is derived in Section 4. Comparison between the uniﬁed deﬁnition pro-
posed by Hwu and Kuo [2] and the present one is then shown in Section 5. Finally, through numerical examples several
important topics are discussed in Section 6, such as (1) comparison between two uniﬁed deﬁnitions, (2) comparison with
the other calculation methods, (3) variation under type change of singular orders, (4) variation around logarithmic singular-
ity, and (5) variation on reference length and radial direction.
2. Stresses near the tip of interface corner
Consider an interface corner between two dissimilar anisotropic elastic materials. To ﬁnd the solutions satisfying all the
basic equations and boundary conditions set for the interface corners, the Stroh formalism for two-dimensional linear aniso-
tropic elasticity was usually employed [7,8]. In this formalism, the stresses rij are determined through the stress functions /i.

The angular bracket hi (without the over dot) stands for a diagonal matrix in which each component is varied according to
the subscript a, e.g. hzai = diag.[z1, z2,z3].
The singular orders da and eigenfunctions k a(h), represent, respectively, the orders of singularity and the angular varia-
tion of the stress ﬁeld. They are dependent upon the material properties and the geometrical conﬁguration of the interface
corners, and can be determined analytically through an eigen-relation shown in [6]. Since the characteristic equation of the
eigen-relation is a transcendental function of d, it may have inﬁnite number of eigenvalues. If only the singular stresses are
considered and the strain energy is required to be bounded, normally it will have three singular orders da, a = 1,2,3, in the
range of 0 < Re (da) < 1. If there are less than three singular orders in the range of 0 < Re (da) < 1 and hence less than three
independent eigenfunctions ka, we may take the non-singular orders from the range Re (da) < 0 as the additional one to
get the complete eigenfunctions. If there are more than three singular orders in the range of 0 < Re (da) < 1, just take the ﬁrst
three critical singular orders and their associated eigenfunctions. Further study is needed to if some other possible cases oc-
cur such that the ﬁrst three critical singular orders cannot be identiﬁed. For example (till now have not been met in this
study), the ﬁrst singular order is distinct but the second singular order is a triple root, or the ﬁrst two singular orders are
double roots, etc.
3. Deﬁnitions of stress intensity factors
From the solutions shown in (2.3)–(2.5), it is observed that the mathematical expressions of the near tip solutions for dis-
tinct singular orders or repeated singular orders can all be organized into the same matrix forms distinguished by the over
dot _ or over double dot € on the eigenfunction matrix K and diagonal matrix hi. Therefore, to simplify our following dis-
cussions only the cases with distinct eigenfunctions will be shown and all the other cases can be obtained automatically just
replacing K and hi by _K and <  _> for case (ii), or by €K and <  €> for case (iii) of Section 2.
From (2.1) and (2.3b), it is observed that the coefﬁcient vector c can be deﬁned by
c ¼ lim
r!0
< rda > K1ðhÞX1ðhÞrðr; hÞ: ð3:1Þ
In this deﬁnition, no speciﬁc value of h is required, which means that the coefﬁcient vector approached from different direc-
tions should all be the same. When h = 0,X(0) = I which is a unit matrix, the combination of (2.1) and (2.3b) gives us
rðr;0Þ ¼ /;rðr;0Þ ¼ K < rda > c; ð3:2aÞ
or
rðr;0Þ ¼ c1rd1k1 þ c2rd2k2 þ c3rd3k3; ð3:2bÞ
whereK =K(0) and ka = ka(0) are the simpliﬁed notations of the eigenfunctions in the direction of h = 0. From (3.2a), we have
c ¼ lim
r!0
< rda > K1rðr;0Þ: ð3:3Þ
From Eq. (3.2b), we see that c1rd1 ; c2rd2 and c3rd3 can be thought as the components of the stresses r(r,0) in the directions
of k1, k2 and k3, respectively. The coefﬁcients ca can therefore be explained as the intensity of singularity of the stresses r(r,0)
in the direction of k1, k2 and k3. Since c1, c2 and c3 are the scalars measuring the intensity of singularity of the stresses ri2, they
may be treated as stress intensity factors. However, several problems occur by using these coefﬁcients to measure the inten-
sity of stress singularity, such as

in which the subscript j or the superscript (j) denotes the value associated with the jth critical singular order; and /1 is the
stress function vector associated with the most critical singular order, and /2 and /3 are the stress function vectors associ-
ated with the next two critical singular orders.
Features: (1) Unit: PamdR ; dR varies with corner angles, material combinations and corner edge boundary conditions.
Owing to the difference of units, it is difﬁcult to compare the stress intensity factors between cracks and corners. (2)
h = 0: can be any radial line starting from the crack/corner tip. (3) For cracks, the reference length ‘ is usually selected
to be the crack length. For corners, it can be selected as one of the structural geometric length. The reference length should
be ﬁxed when making a comparison. (4) dR: the real part of the most critical singular order. The deﬁnition (3.9) considers
only the stress intensity factors associated with the most critical singular order. The stress intensity factors associated
with lower singular orders are deﬁned separately in (3.10). Through this deﬁnition, it is possible that for some corner
problems certain modes of stress intensity factors will be lost without considering the lower singular orders. (5) This def-
inition can be reduced to the classical deﬁnitions for cracks (dR = 0.5,e1 = e2 = e3 = 0) and interface cracks (dR = 0.5,e1 =  e2
= e, e3 = 0).

p
K < ðr=‘Þda > K1rðr; hÞ; ð3:11Þ
where da, a = 1,2,3 are the ﬁrst three critical singular orders, which may be distinct or repeated, real or complex. If some
eigenfunctions are missing due to the repeated roots of singular orders, replace K and hi by _K and <  _> for case (ii), or
by €K and <  €> for case (iii) of Section 2.
Features: (1) Unit: Pa

, a uniﬁed unit for cracks, interface cracks, corners and interface corners, which will be helpful
for bridging the problems of cracks and corners. (2) h = 0: can be any radial line starting from the crack/corner tip. (3) Same
situation as deﬁnition (3.9) for the selection of the reference length ‘. (4) d1, d2, d3: the ﬁrst three critical singular orders,
which can be repeated or distinct, real or complex. The stress intensity factors associated with the ﬁrst three critical singular
orders have all been considered in one deﬁnition. (5) This deﬁnition can also be reduced to the classical deﬁnitions for cracks
and interface cracks.
As discussed above the newly deﬁned stress intensity factors k have many good features to build the connections be-
tween cracks and corners. From (3.3) and (3.5), we can get the relation between the coefﬁcient vector c and vector of stress
intensity factors k, which is

Although the values of stress intensity factors depend on the selection of the reference length, it is not difﬁcult to trans-
form their values from one reference length to the other reference length. If k(‘1) and k(‘2) denote the stress intensity
factors calculated by using reference lengths ‘1 and ‘2, respectively, their relation can be found from the deﬁnition (3.11),
which is
kð‘2Þ ¼

p
K < ð‘1=‘2Þda > K1kð‘1Þ: ð3:13Þ
Since the values of the stress intensity factors depend on the selection of reference length, further investigation is needed to
know whether the failure criterion established based upon the present deﬁnition depends on the selection of reference
length. In other words, proper experimental designs are still required to know whether the reference length ‘ is simply
an auxiliary parameter or a material property for the general interface corner problems. If the reference length ‘ can be se-
lected arbitrarily, it is suggested to be crack length, or corner edge, or interface length when a crack/corner or an interface
crack/corner is considered.
If k(h) denotes the stress intensity factors deﬁned based upon the radial direction h = constant instead of h = 0 given in
(3.11), it is related to k by [6]
kðhÞ ¼ XðhÞKðhÞK1k: ð3:14Þ
By using the relations obtained in (2.1), (2.3b), (3.12) and (3.14), it has been shown in our recent work [6] that the stresses
near the tip of interface corners can be written in the form of matrix power function as
rðr; hÞ ¼ 1ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

5. Comparison between two uniﬁed deﬁnitions
Since the ﬁrst two deﬁnitions stated in Section 3 are for the crack problems and cannot be applied to the general interface
corners, in this Section the comparison is made for the last two uniﬁed deﬁnitions. To distinguish these two deﬁnitions, in
the following discussions the superscripts C and D are added on k, i.e., kC for the deﬁnitions given in (3.9) and (3.10), and kD
for the deﬁnition given in (3.11). As mentioned in the sentence below (3.19), kD has been proved to be exactly the same as
the deﬁnition with matrix power function form proposed by Song, et al. [5]. Moreover, by careful derivation it can also be
proved that kD is just ‘0:5Refd1g times of the deﬁnition proposed by Nomura, et al. [4]. Thus, comparison between kC and
kD will provide the investigation among the deﬁnitions proposed in [2–5]. Since their relations will depend on the conditions
of singular orders and eigenfunctions, the comparison is categorized into the following four cases.
Case 1: da are distinct and real (d1 >d2>d3,k1– k2– k3).
In this case all the singular orders are real. Thus, the oscillatory index ea = 0 and kC deﬁned in (3.9) becomes
kC ¼ lim

On the other hand, by using the relation (3.12) we have

If the eigenfunction k1 is a full vector, the stress intensity factor kC associated with the most critical singular order d1 will
contain the complete modes of intensity factors and therefore the deﬁnition associated with the lower singular orders d2

Case 2: da are double and real (d1 = d2 > d3).
In this case one of the singular orders is repeated and has double roots. Thus, two possible situations may occur. One still
has three independent eigenfunctions, i.e., k1– k2– k3, and the other has only two independent eigenfunctions, i.e.,
k1 = k2– k3. For the second case, like the case (ii) discussed in Section 2 we need the generalized eigenfunction _K1 to
compensate the missing eigenfunction k2. Since the determination of kwill be different for this two situations, two different
sub-cases are considered in this case.

10–12) are presented to show that kC and kD are not related for some cases such as cases 1-b, 1-c and 2-b discussed in
Section 5.
From the discussions given at the end of Section 5 and the numerical results shown in Table 3 for 12 different problems,
we see that kD is really much more appropriate than kC to be the uniﬁed deﬁnition for the stress intensity factors of interface
corners. The numerical results of Table 3 also show that the stress intensity factors kD can be calculated accurately and efﬁ-
ciently through the relation (4.6) in which the vector h contains the values obtained by the path-independent H-integral de-
ﬁned in (4.1) with the auxiliary near tip solutions provided in (4.7).
6.2. Comparison with the other calculation methods
Although the correctness of the calculation method has been veriﬁed in Table 3 through the comparison with the existing
solutions presented in [2], all these solutions are calculated via H-integral. To get further veriﬁcation, a simple example
which has been executed by several different calculation methods is illustrated in this subsection.
Consider an inclined crack in a homogeneous rectangular plate subjected to a uniform tension r0 at two opposite edges
(Fig. 2). The geometry and loading used in this example are b/h = 1,a/h = 0.5,h = 4 in, r0 = 1Psi with inclined angle a varying in
the analysis. The material of the plate is considered to be a cubic material whose mechanical properties are:
E11 ¼ E22 ¼ E33 ¼ 15:4 106 Psi;
G12 ¼ G23 ¼ G13 ¼ 15:7 106 Psi; m12 ¼ m23 ¼ m13 ¼ 0:4009:
ð6:2Þ
The problem is assumed to be under plane strain condition. The displacement u and traction t of the actual system required
in the calculation of H-integral are obtained from the commercial ﬁnite element software ANSYS. The moving least square
method is employed to interpolate the displacements and tractions through the surrounding nodal points [4]. The displace-
ment u^ and traction t^ of the auxiliary system are provided in (4.7) with t = /,h/r for circular paths. The choice of ﬁnite element
meshes and integration paths of H-integral depends on the convergence test. Fig. 3 shows three different ﬁnite element
meshes for an inclined crack in a ﬁnite plate with a/b = 1/2,h/b = 1 and a = 45. Through the convergence test we choose mesh
(c) with 28580 PLANE182 elements and 28650 nodes for this problem. The path-independent property of H-integral is con-
ﬁrmed through the numerical computation shown in Table 4 in which four different paths used in our calculation are shown
in Fig. 4. Table 5 shows the results of stress intensity factors compared with those calculated by M-integral [19], displace-
ment extrapolation [19], and scaled boundary ﬁnite element method [5]. Good agreement is observed. The differences be-
tween these calculation methods are: (1) M-integral and displacement extrapolation employed by Bank-Sills, et al. [19] are
applicable only for crack problems; (2) the scaled boundary ﬁnite element method is a special element code developed by
Song, et al. [5], which can be employed in both crack and corner problems but is not convenient for general users; (3) H-inte-
gral employed in the present paper is applicable for both crack and corner problems.
In addition to the problems of inclined cracks taken from [19], some other problems studied in [5] such as interfacial
cracks, and V-notched bimaterial plates, etc., are all performed and compared in this study. Since all the numerical results
well agree with each other and detailed discussions about the singular behavior can be found in [5], to save the space of this
paper no further results will be presented for these examples.
6.3. Variation under type change of singular orders
From the previous discussions, we see that the problems of interface corners will meet the type change of singular orders
when the corner angle changes. To see this phenomena more clearly, here we take the example of interface corners consid-

ered in [2]. Fig. 5 shows the geometry, loading and boundary conditions of this example. The interface length d = 5 mm, and
the reference length ‘is selected to be 10 mm. The material above and below the interface are, respectively, Mat.C (isotropic)
and Mat.D with c = 0o (orthotropic), whose properties are given in (6.1). Fig. 6 shows the ﬁrst three singular orders for inter-
face corners ranging from Dh1 = 20o to 180o. It is interesting to see that the singular orders meet the type change at
Dh1 = 64.670o and D h1 = 140.597o, and hence we divide Fig. 6 into the following three regions:
Region A ð20o < Dh1 < 64:670oÞ :
only two real singular orders; case 1 b with Reðd3Þ < 0:
Region B ð64:670o < Dh1 < 140:597oÞ :
three real singular orders; case 1 b:
Region C ð140:597o < Dh1 < 180oÞ :
one real and two complex singular orders; case 4:
ð6:3Þ
It has been shown in our previous study [2] that kC will have an abrupt change at the transition angle D h1 = 140.597o which
is the angle that two of the singular orders will change from real value to complex value. Song, et al. [5] mentioned this
change and questioned the suitability of the uniﬁed deﬁnition kC in constructing material failure criteria. Since this kind
of type change means repeated root of singular orders occurs at this transition angle, Song, et al. [5] concluded that this
non-smooth change of stress intensity factors may be due to the neglect of logarithmic singularity. With this argument, it
is now interesting to see the performance of the newly deﬁned stress intensity factor kD.
Fig. 7 shows the results of stress intensity factors versus angle of interface cornerDh1. From this Figure, we see that for K
D
I
and KDII no abrupt change occurs in the entire region, whereas both K
C
I and K
C
II meet an abrupt change at the transition angle
Dh1 = 140.597o. In this Figure, all the data points are plotted without consideration of the logarithmic singularity. Thus, it
seems that the main reason for the discontinuity of type change in kC is not the consideration of logarithmic singularity.
Through the discussions provided in Section 5, we see that kC is nothing to do with the third eigenfunction k3 for case 1-b,

entiation of eigen-relation. For example, if the eigen-relation can be expressed as Zk = 0 where Z is a matrix of variable d, by
differentiation with respect to d we have Z _K ¼  _Zk and hence Z _Z1Z _K ¼ 0 which can provide the value of _K1. Alternatively,
we can also calculate _K1 by _K1 ¼ Z1 _Zk1. Through this way, to get Z1 small perturbation around d1 is necessary since the
determinant of matrix Z is zero when d1 is the root of Zk = 0.
Despite the inapplicability at the transition angle and the inaccuracy at the very nearby transition angle, smooth and
accurate results of the stress intensity factors are obtained for all the other corner angles. Therefore, if the stress intensity
factors can not be calculated through (3.11) or (4.6) due to the repeated root of singular orders, small perturbation of corner
angle, e.g., ±104 degree, can be employed to get the stress intensity factors through (3.11) or (4.6) without involving the
modiﬁed deﬁnition (5.19). This enhances the conclusion stated in the previous subsection that the newly deﬁned stress
intensity factors kD will always perform smoothly even without considering the logarithmic singularity for the repeated root
of singular orders.
Note that the problem of logarithmic singularity has also been discussed in [5] via the scaled boundary ﬁnite element
method. With the same approach stated in this subsection, the V-notched bimaterial plate presented in [5] has been exe-
cuted in this study, and same results as [5] are obtained without using the modiﬁed deﬁnition (5.19).
6.5. Variation on reference length and radial direction
The dependence of the stress intensity factors on reference length and radial direction can be studied through the rela-
tions given in (3.13) and (3.14). Substituting the singular orders and eigenfunctions presented in Tables 1 and 2 for ﬁve dif-
ferent problems of Table 3 (Prob.1, 4, 6, 8, 12) into (3.13), the variations of KI(‘2)/KI (‘1) and KII(‘2)/KII(‘1) on ‘2/‘1 can be
obtained. The results are shown in Fig. 8(a) and (b). From these two ﬁgures we see that no matter which type of singularity
the values of stress intensity factors will always increase/decrease monotonically or remain unchanged when the reference
length increases.
To see the variation of stress intensity factors on the radial direction, the problem of an interface corner shown in Fig. 5
with Dh1 = 5p/6 is considered. All the other conditions are the same as those stated in subsection (3) for the discussions of
type change of singular orders. The singular orders and their associated eigenfunctions of this problem can be found in No.3
of Table 2. Fig. 9 shows the results of stress intensity factors versus radial direction. From this Figure, we see that maximum
KI(h) occurs at the direction hp =  25.82o where KII(hp) = 0. However, when KII(h) reaches a maximal value, the associated KI
(h) may not be zero. This phenomenon is similar to the stresses, and hence the maximum KI(h) is called the principal stress
intensity factor in our recent work [6]. To see the near tip stress distribution along the principal radial direction, we ﬁrst
calculate the transformed eigenfunction matrix K⁄(hp) deﬁned in (3.16), which is

From the results of (6.6) and the relation given in (3.15) for the near tip stresses, we observe that even KII(hp) = 0 the shear
stress rrh(r,hp) may not be zero. This means that KI(hp)– 0 and KII(hp) = 0 may not represent the pure tension condition in the
general interface corner problems.
When a crack in a homogeneous isotropic material is considered, such as Fig. 2 with the inclined angle a = 45o, we get d1
= d2 = d3 = 0.5,hp =  6.85o. With these results, the diagonal matrices < da> and < ðr=‘Þda > will become an identity matrix I
multiplied by the scalars 0.5 and (r/‘)0.5. Thus, D(hp) and ðr=‘ÞDðhpÞ deﬁned in (3.16) and (3.17) become
DðhpÞ ¼ 0:5I; ðr=‘ÞDðhpÞ ¼ ðr=‘Þ0:5I: ð6:7Þ
Under this situation, KI(hp)– 0 and KII (hp) = 0 really represents the pure tension condition, and KI (hp) = 0 and KII(hp)– 0 rep-
resents the pure shear condition.
7. Conclusions
A new deﬁnition of stress intensity factor is proposed in (3.11) for all possible cases of interface corners. To calculate this
factor accurately and efﬁciently, a new relation between the path-independent H-integral and the stress intensity factors is
obtained in (4.6). The auxiliary near tip solutions necessary for the computation of H-integral are provided in (4.7). To know
the difference between previous deﬁnition of the stress intensity factors and the present one, the relations between two uni-
ﬁed deﬁnitions for certain cases are summarized in (5.28). To show the correctness of H-integral calculation and to verify the
appropriateness of the present deﬁnition, several numerical examples are presented in Section 6.
When written in a matrix power function form (3.19), the present uniﬁed deﬁnition of the stress intensity factors is iden-
tical to that proposed by Song et al. [5], and hence has the features stated in Song’s paper such as (1) inclusion of cracks and
interface cracks as special cases, (2) validity for real and complex types of singularity as well as the transition case where the
logarithmic singularity exists, (3) smooth variation as the stress singularity changes among real, complex and logarithmic
types, (4) a uniﬁed unit (Pa
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
m
p Þ for all possible interface corners. All these features are also veriﬁed through the numerical
investigation shown in Section 6.

center point of the laminated plates (due to the page limit, the numerical results of bending 
moments are not shown in this Table). All numerical results well agree each other, and the 
coupling effects can be observed through the appearance of the inplane forces in the 
unsymmetric laminates.
