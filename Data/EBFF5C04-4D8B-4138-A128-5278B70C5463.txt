Downlink Optimization and Performance of Relay-Assisted Cellular 
Networks in Multi-Cell Environments 
 
ABSTRACT 
Deploying fixed relay stations (RSs) in the traditional mobile cellular networks is widely 
recognized as a promising technology to improve cell coverage, user throughput and system 
capacity, to save transmit power of a mobile station (MS) in the uplink, and to provide a low cost 
deployment for coverage extension.  One crucial step toward developing such a relay-assisted 
cellular network is to fully evaluate its performance both from theoretical and practical 
viewpoints. So far, however, the system has been evaluated only for very limited system 
configurations: with a fixed number of RSs and locations and/or a fixed frequency-reuse pattern. 
This paper aims to investigate the downlink performance limits of a general relay-assisted 
network in a multi-cell environment with optimized system parameters. A genetic-algorithm (GA) 
based approach is employed for joint optimization of system parameters, including RS’s number 
and locations, frequency reuse pattern, path selection and resource allocation, etc. so as to 
maximize the system spectral efficiency.  Two types of quality of end-user experience (QoE) 
(fixed bandwidth and fixed throughput) are investigated along with two path selection methods 
(spectral efficiency-based and signal to noise plus interference ratio-based). Numerical results 
show that significant improvement in system performance can be achieved with the optimized 
system parameters.  
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Deploying fixed relay stations (RSs) in the traditional cellular networks, as known as the 
relay-assisted cellular networks, has been widely recognized as a promising technology to 
 6 
of RS operations, including the transplant and non-transparent RSs with the centralized or the 
distributed scheduling, in [12] the deployment of RSs for coverage extension was investigated, 
and in [13]-[14], the issue of placement of BSs and RSs was considered with [13] focusing on the 
coverage extension application and [14] on the down-link performance with different number of 
RSs and cell radii. Lastly, in [15], the optimal placement of RSs and their time allocation were 
studied for the system of employing one RS in a cell with uneven traffic distribution. 
So far, as discussed above, the performance evaluation and optimization of the relay-assisted 
cellular networks has been limited to very specific system configurations: with a fixed number of 
RSs and/or using fixed reuse patterns. In this paper, our aim is to investigate the downlink 
performance limits of a general relay-assisted network from an information-theoretic viewpoint 
in a multi-cell environment. Two types of quality of end-user experience (QoE) (fixed bandwidth 
and fixed throughput) are investigated along with two path selection methods (spectral 
efficiency-based and signal to noise plus interference ratio-based). A genetic-algorithm (GA) 
based approach is proposed for joint optimization of the system parameters including RS’s 
positions, reuse pattern, path selection and resource allocation among different links to maximize 
the system spectral efficiency. The theoretical performance serves as benchmarks for more 
practical relay-assisted cellular networks, where the effects of modulation and coding schemes 
(MCSs) and signaling overhead that enables the RSs’ opertaion need to be taken into 
considerations.  
This rest of the report is organized as follows. Section II describes the system model 
including multi-cell architecture, RS operation modes, propagation models, power-setting criteria, 
path selection methods and reuse patterns. Sections III proposes the joint optimization based on a 
GA algorithm for different system configurations. Section IV gives the numerical results, and 
lastly the paper is concluded in Section V.

where d is the separation (in meters) between transmitter and receiver. The LOS model is used 
for the BS-RS link because RSs are often mounted over the rooftops, whereas the NLOS model is 
for the BS-MS and RS-MS links. Also, the NLOS model is used for the calculation of multiple 
access interference (MAI).  
For the shadowing loss, a simplified model given in (2.3), is adopted for verifying the 
effectiveness of the proposed method in a shadowed environment. Some other shadowing models 
can be used as well.

In particular, the shadowed environment in Fig. 3, consisting of 4 obstacles, will be used in 
Section IV for numerical results. In this setup, a MS is said to be in a shadowed area if the LOS 
between BS (RS) and MS passes through an obstacle. No shadowing loss is imposed on the 
BS-RS link. 
II-B  Antenna Configurations 
RS and MS are equipped with one omni-directional antenna, respectively, whereas both 
omni-directional and sectored antenna configurations are investigated for BSs. For the sectored 
antenna, the antenna pattern proposed in [17] is adopted, which is

with the power settings in (2.7) and (2.8), the coverage of RSs is entirely within that of the BS. In 
this configuration, RSs are mainly used for improving system capacity and user throughput rather 
than for coverage extension, a case where RSs are usually deployed at cell boundary to extend 
the BS’s coverage.  
II-D  Path Selection 
   Path selection is a procedure referring to the determination as to whether the direct path or the 
2-hop path is to be taken by a MS to communicate with the BS. Two types of path selection will 
be investigated: the SINR-based and spectral efficiency (SE)-based.  For the SINR-based path 
selection, the direct path is selected if     

III-B  Optimization Algorithm 
It is easy to see, from (3.1), that S  is a highly nonlinear function of   and Gi , given a QoE 
criterion and a path selection method, and generally, an analytic close-form solution is not 
available. In this section, a GA-based, two-step optimization algorithm is devised to solve the 
optimization problem. In the first step, GA is used to find the optimal RS’s position given a reuse 
pattern. Then, the optimal reuse pattern is sought exhaustively in the second step.  
 GA is a stochastic search technique and has been successfully applied to a wide range of 
 16 
whereas those with less fitness are discarded. The selection rate to survive is denoted as   
so that only the best 
sur popN N   chromosomes survive after evaluation, and the rest are 
discarded to make room for the new offspring. 
 Mate Selection: Two mates (chromosomes) are selected from the mating pool of 
surN  
chromosomes to produce two new offspring. We apply the most commonly used mate 
selection scheme in GA applications: Roulette wheel selection [20], where the survival 
chromosome is chosen to be one of the parents with the probability

 ,                                               (3.23) 
where ( )kS    is the fitness value for the particular chromosome k . Roulette wheel 
selection emulates the survival of the fittest mechanism in nature, where the fitter 
chromosome (to have good genes to survive) will have higher chance to be selected to create 
offspring. The offspring inherits good genes from parents may have higher probability of 
survival in the subsequent generation.  
 Crossover: After two distinct chromosomes (mates) are selected, a crossover is performed to 
produce two new offspring. The uniform crossover is adopted in this work, where each gene 
in offspring is randomly decided whether or not to interchange information between the two 
mates [20]-[21]. In addition, in a real-valued encoding scheme a small zero-mean random 
perturbation is suggested to add to each gene of the offspring [22] in order to prevent the 
evolutions being dominated by few genes. In our method, the Gaussian variable with 
variance equal to a grid length is used as the perturbation. The newly generated offspring 
together with the survival population in the previous generation form a new generation for 
the next step evolution. 
 Mutation: Besides the crossover, mutation is another way to force the algorithm to explore 
other areas of the solution space in the searching process. A mutation probability 
mutP  is set 
to determine whether a gene is mutated or not. Once a mutation is performed, the coordinate 
 18 
distance of 680 meters from BS. As can be seen, user throughput is improved significantly at the 
close proximity of RSs. Note that the optimal placement of RSs is not unique in this case; as long 
as RSs are placed on the lines connecting the cell center and any two of vertices at the same 
distance from BS, the system performance is the same. Fig. 4 (c) illustrates the case of six RSs. 
Again, RSs are placed on the lines connecting the cell center and vertices, and all of them locate 
on the ring with distance about 680 meters from BS. As the number of RS increases, however, the 
optimal RS locations can split into more than one ring, as one might expect. Fig. 4 (d) is such an 
example with 14 RSs.  
Table 1 (a) summarizes the important system parameters for FBA-SE, including service area 
ratio of BS and RSs, bandwidth allocation ratio for the BS-MS link, the BS-RS link and the 
RS-MS link, and the system spectral efficiency. As is shown, the system spectral efficiency is 
improved significantly with the deployment of RSs; around 4.23% for each addition of RS when 
6N  . The improvement becomes smaller, however, as the number of RSs is larger than 6, 
where RSs begin to compete to each other for serving MS rather than to compete with BS. Fig. 5 
is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the user throughput for different N . Clearly, the 
percentage of user with low throughput decreases as N  increases. In other words, the 
achievable data-rate is distributed more uniformly over the cell. In addition, it is observed that the 
improvement becomes smaller when 10N  .  
As for FBA-SINR, the optimal RSs are placed in a way similar to FBA-SE except that the 
RSs are generally a bit far from BS than that of FBA-SE. Table 1 (b) is the summary of important 
system parameters. Somewhat surprising, FBA-SINR performs very closely to that of FBA-SE 
with respect to system spectral efficiency after optimization with GA Note that the SINR-based 
path selection is much simpler to implement than the SE-based one. 
Fig. 6 shows the complementary CDF of bandwidth consumption for FTA-SE. A can be seen, 
the percentage of high bandwidth consumption is reduced as the number of RSs increases. Table 
1(c) summarizes the important parameters for FTA-SE, and those for FTA-SINR are summarized 
 20 
system performance. The simplified shadow model in Figure 3 is adopted with four obstacles (of 
length 800 meters) centered at (0, ±750) and (±750, 0). Two values of shadowing loss δ = 10 dB 
and δ = 20 dB are considered (see (2.3)). Only FBA-SE is shown here as an example. In Figs. 
10(a) and (c), the achievable throughput in the shadowed area is very low if there is no RS in the 
cell, as one might expect. With the deployment of RSs, on the other hand, the optimization 
algorithm suggests that RS should be placed at (0, ±760) and (±760, 0) which are right behinds 
the four obstacles. The throughput enhancement is shown in Figs. 10(b) and (d) for δ=10 dB and 
δ=20 dB, respectively. In Fig.10(b), in addition to serve the severely shadowed area, RSs also 
provide service to small fractions of the area across the obstacle where the throughput provided 
by RSs is higher than that by BS. In Fig. 10(d), we can see that this area is reduced as the 
shadowing loss increases. 
IV-A.3 Sectorization 
In this section, we investigate how RSs are placed and how they can improve the system 
performance when the BS is equipped with a sectored antenna. A three-sector antenna is 
employed with the antenna pattern given in (2.4). FTA-SE is taken as an example. In the 
sectorized cell, the power of BS is set to achieve the targeted spectral efficiency 
0.5 bps/HzedgeS   for the users at the worst locations, that is the cell vertices on the sector 
boundary. Notice that with this power setting, the users at the cell vertices in the antenna bearing 
direction can enjoy higher spectral efficiency. Fig. 11 (a) shows the distribution of bandwidth 
consumption for achieving 1 bpstt   (per unit area) with no RS in the cell. As can be seen, users 
at the cell vertices on the sector boundary need 2 Hz to support the targeted throughput while the 
users at the cell vertices in the antenna beraing direction only need 0.5Hz. S  in this case is 
2.92 bps/Hz.  
Figs. 11(b)-(d) show the results for using 3 RSs. No frequency reuse over the RS-MS links is 
considered.. Figure 11 (b) gives the optimal RSs positions and the distribution of bandwidth 
 22 
in the multi-cell environment. A genetic-algorithm based approach is proposed for joint 
multi-cell optimization of system parameters including RS’s positions, path selection, 
frequency-reuse pattern and resource allocation so as to maximize system spectral efficiency. 
Four different system configurations are considered that includes FBA-SE (fixed-bandwidth 
allocation with spectral efficiency-based path selection), FBA-SINR (fixed-bandwidth allocation 
with SINR-based path selection), FTA-SE (fixed-throughput allocation with spectral 
efficiency-based path selection and FTA-SINR (fixed throughput allocation with SINR-based 
path selection).  Numerical results show that (i) RSs provide significant improvement with 
respect to system spectral efficiency and user throughput over the traditional cellular networks, (ii) 
uniformity of user data rate comes at the expense of a large loss in system spectral efficiency 
when FTA is employed, and (iii) somewhat surprising, the low-complexity SINR-based path 
selection performs nearly as good as the SE-based one for the no reuse case while slightly better 
in the frequency-reuse case.

Uplink Performance and Optimization of Relay-assisted Cellular 
Networks 
 
ABSTRACT 
Using relay stations (RSs) has been known as a promising technology to improve the system 
performance of a traditional cellular network. This paper aims to investigate the uplink 
performance of a relay-assisted cellular network with optimization on system parameters. Two 
performance measures, average power consumption of mobile stations and uplink system spectral 
efficiency, are optimized by jointly considering the system parameters of RSs’ locations, reuse 
patterns, path selections and resource allocation. A genetic algorithm tailored specifically for this 
along with a method of MAI (multiple access interference) estimation is proposed to solve the 
optimization problem. Numerical results show that significant improvement on system 
performance can be achieved from both power consumption and system spectral efficiency 
aspects if RSs are deployed and used in the optimal way. 
 42 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the system setups. Section 
III formulates the objective functions under different criteria. The optimization algorithm is 
described in Section IV. Section V provides the numerical results, and finally, conclusions are in 
Section VI. 
 
I. System Setups 
A. Cell configuration 
Fig. 1(a) depicts a hexagon cell structure with radius D  and coverage   investigated in this 
paper. The BS is located in the center of the cell. N RSs are deployed into the cell to improve the 
network performance with the position vector 
jr

 of the j-th RS 
jR  and  jr

  is the set of 
N RSs’ positions. The position vector of MS is m

. Assume MSs are uniformly distributed over 
 . MS can communicate with BS either through a direct path (the MS-BS link) or a 2-hop path 
(via a RS) which forms the MS-RS link and the RS-BS link. All stations (BS, RSs and MSs) are 
equipped with an omni-directional antenna and one RF transceiver. 
 
B. Relaying technique 
We consider that RSs operate in the in-band decode-and-forward mode, where the received signal 
is fully decoded and then forwarded to the destination, by using the same transmission 
technology as the BS in the same frequency band. Besides, the orthogonal radio resources are 
allocated for direct paths and 2-hop paths individually. Fig. 1(b) illustrates a practical uplink 
radio resource allocation scheme, where resource for 2-hop links is further divided into two parts: 
one for the MS-RS transmissions and the other for the RS-BS transmissions. With this allocation, 
RSs do not need to transmit and receive at the same time (half-duplex relaying). 
 
C. Propagation models 
The line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) path-loss models for suburban macro-cell 
environment in [11] are adopted, which are given in (2.1) and (2.2), respectively.  
 44 
           2S I N R l o g 1 S I N Rf   ,                                     (2.5) 
where h  is a constant in (2.4). For a fading channel, on the other hand,  SINRf  may not 
assume a close form as in (2.5) and needs to be evaluated numerically, depending on the 
considered fading characteristics and whether the channel state information is available at 
transmitter [18]. In any case, for a specific spectral efficiency S , the required SINR can be 
found by  1SINR f S .  
   In this work, the AWGN channel is adopted as an example to demonstrate the theoretical 
uplink performance. Let 
edgeS  be the targeted spectral efficiency for a MS at the cell boundary, 
the transmit PSD of 
jR  is set as

where jr

jr

. The power setup in (2.6) is 
not unique. Some other measures may be applied as well. 
 
E. Frequency reuse over MS-RS links 
In Fig. 1(a), it is clear that the same radio resource can be reused in a cell over the MS-RS link to 
increase spectral efficiency because of the spatial separation between RSs. To exploit this 
advantage, let RSs be divided into L  groups, where L N , and each group shares the same 
radio resource. The reuse pattern then can be specified conveniently by the set  

A. Measure 1 –Minimization of Average MS’s Transmit Power 
In this subsection, the average uplink transmit power of MS will be minimized to achieve a 
targeted throughput

B. MAI estimation algorithm 
An MAI estimation algorithm, shown in Fig. 2, is proposed to determine the MAI level 
when the frequency is reused over the MS-RS links.  
First, MS chooses the nearest BS or RS as its serving station so that the 
B  and jR  are 
predetermined. Given a MS served by the k-th RS in the reuse group l , i.e., 
kl
Rm

, the MAI 
for this MS is caused by the co-channel user in 
lG . We calculate the MAI level for the MS by 
averaging over the potential interference area, which is expressed by

where 
IM  is the interference source with position vector Im

 and 
iR  is its serving station. 
In Measure 1, we assume 
0 0I N  for the initial power setup of the interference source, 
which is

  
                        (4.2) 
Substituting (4.2) into (4.1), the average MAI level for the MS is obtained. Then, the transmit 
power of m

 for a 2-hop path can be determined by  
0( ) (2 1) ( ) ( )

                   (4.3) 
MS can decide its new serving station by choosing minimal transmit power among direct path 
and 2-hop path. Then, 
B  and R  are re-determined.  
In Measure 2, ( )
I iM R I M
P m P 

, and the throughput for 2-hop path can be determined by 
following the process (3.21) to (3.29). Again, MS can decide its new serving station by choosing 
maximization throughput among direct path and 2-hop path so that 
B  and R  can be are 
re-decided.  
The procedure is repeated until the service area is converged or the maximum iteration 
number is reached.  
 52 
transmit power is -2.05 dBm, which is reduced 16.59 dB as compared to 0N  . It is clear that if 
the RS-BS link was perfect in the 2-hop path, the service area border of BS and RS would be in 
the perpendicular bisection of line segment connecting BS and RS. Table 1 summarizes the 
service area ratio of BS and RSs, bandwidth allocation ratio for MS-BS links, MS-RS links, and 
RS-BS links, and the average uplink transmit power for 0N   to 10N  . Fig. 4 depicts the 
complementary cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of MS’s power consumptions. As can 
be seen, the percentage of large power consumption area is significantly reduced with the help 
from RSs.  
In this subsection, frequency reuse over the MS-RS links is explored to further utilize the 
radio resource. The case of 6N   is taken as an example. Fig. 5 (a) to (d) depicts the optimal 
RSs’ locations and the distribution of power consumptions for the following reuse 
patterns,
1 2 3 4 5 6G={G , G , G , G , G , G } , 1 2 3G={G , G , G } , 1 2G={G , G }  and 1G={G } , 
respectively. Note that each reuse group has equal number of RSs. As can be seen, RSs are placed 
on the line connecting the cell center to six vertices of the cell in each case with RSs in the same 
reuse group being pulled as far apart as possible. Table 2 provides more detailed parameters of all 
cases. The uplink system spectral efficiency is getting better when the frequency is more 
aggressively reused (i.e., 
1G={G }); however, it costs more transmit power to achieve the same 
targeted throughput due to larger MAI.  
 A simplified shadowing model is also given to verify the effectiveness of the deployment of 
RSs. Two obstacles of length 800 m are centered at (690, 0) and (-690, 0). The shadow loss 
10   dB is adopted if the line of sight of MS and BS is blocked by any obstacle. In Fig. 6(a), 
MS in the shadowed area needs very high transmit power level to achieve the targeted throughput 
14.25tT   Kbps, as one might expect. The average MS’s transmit power is 20.47 dBm in this 
case. Fig. 6(b) shows the case with two RSs deployed into the cell. The optimization algorithm 
suggests RSs to be placed at (700, -420) and (-700, 420) to reduce the percentage of that the line 
of sight of MS and its serving station (BS or RS) has been blocked by any obstacle. Black lines 
circle the service area of each RS. As can be seen, the ratio of MSs in the shadowed area is 
significantly decreased, except that a few MSs who are close to RS still have smaller propagation 
 54 
aggressively reused (i.e., 
1G={G }). With respect to the service area ratio, R  tends to be larger 
in 
1 2 3G={G , G , G }  and 1 2G={G , G } cases. However, in the case of 1G={G }, R  is shrunk

 The simplified shadowing model mentioned in section V-A is investigated in this subsection. 
The shadow loss 10   dB is adopted. MS’s transmit power 
MP  is set as 20 dBm. As can be 
seen in Fig. 9(a), the throughput (link spectral efficiency) of MS in the shadowed area is 
relatively low with only BS as serving station. While with two RSs’ help, which is shown in Fig. 
9(b), the link spectral efficiency is significantly improved. The optimal RSs’ positions are at (700, 
-420) and (-700, 420), where MS may have higher probability to avoid blocking by any obstacle 
to its serving station. Similarly, the link spectral efficiency of any 2-hop link is restricted by the 
minimal throughput of the MS-RS link and the RS-BS link. Note that the optimal RSs’ locations 
may highly depend on the topography and other constraints. The example we demonstrate here is 
to show the feasibility of the proposed method in the shadowed environment.  
 
V. Conclusions 
In this work, the uplink performance of relay-assisted cellular networks is investigated with 
optimized system parameters. The optimal RSs’ positions, reuse pattern, path selection and 
bandwidth allocation are searched to achieve two goals: one is to minimize the MS’s average 
transmit power to achieve a specified throughput, and the other is to maximize the uplink system 
spectral efficiency by given a fixed MS transmit power.  The advance formulation of each 
objective function is contributed. Genetic algorithm approach along with a multiple access 
interference estimation method designed for uplink performance evaluations are adopted to 
resolve the issues. Numerical results conclude that given a fixed allocated bandwidth to each MS, 
the average MS’s transmit power is significantly reduced for a targeted throughput, and the user 
throughput as well as the system spectral efficiency are largely enhanced for a fixed uplink 
transmit power with the assistance of RSs as compared to the conventional cellular system.
