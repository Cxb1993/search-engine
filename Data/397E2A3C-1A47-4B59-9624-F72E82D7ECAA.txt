It should be noted that the clock waveforms
with the primed superscripts change before
the nonprimed waveforms in order to reduce
nonlinearities due to charge injection.
Another technique to further reduce the
number of bootstrapped switches is shown in
Fig. 5, where switches S1 and S4(S1’andS4’)
are bootstrapped switches. Those switches
connected to SSV are realized with NMOS
transistors, while those switches connected to
DDV are realized with PMOS transistors. In
Fig. 5 a single reference voltage at SSV is
used. However, the signal still varies around
2
SSDD VV  at the circuit input as well as at the
op amp output to preserve the maximum
swing. The difference between the two
reference voltages is compensated by
injecting a fixed amount of charge at the op
amp input using extra capacitor pairs

Fig. 6 is the single-ended version of Fig. 5. To
see how this circuit operates, consider the
inverting circuit during the reset phase ( 1)
and during valid output phase ( 2), as shown
in Fig. 7. Then based on charge conservation
principle we can write:

(4.1) LOW-VOLTAGE BUILDING BLOCKS
In this section, the low-voltage circuit
building blocks used in the two fully
differential CMOS switched-capacitor
amplifiers are discussed.
(4.1.1) Op Amp
Fig. 8 shows the used op amp. It is based
on a fully differential folded-cascode p-type
two-stage Miller-compensated configuration.
The second stage is a common-source
amplifier with active load which also allows a
large output swing. In order to avoid the
common-mode feedback (CMFB) circuit for
the first stage, transistors M51, M52, M61,
and M62 are used, which is similar to [5]. The
differential output conductance seen at the
output of the first stage (nodes n3 and n4) is
given by

gdsgdsgds

. (5)
With 5251 gmgm  , the transconductance
51gm seen at the gate of transistors M51 and
M61 is thus cancelled by the opposite action
of the parallel transistors M52 and M62,
respectively. This negative feedback
connection causes the differential signal at the
output of the first stage to see a high load
impedance limited by 8/1 gds . On the other
hand, for the common mode signal, the output
conductance is still given by (5) with the
negative sign turned positive. The
conductance is thus limited by 5251 gmgm  .
This is a low impedance and consequently the
first stage does not require an additional
CMFB circuit.
For the second stage, a simple
passive switched-capacitor CMFB circuit,
shown in Fig. 9, is used. The bootstrapped
switches are used to connect and disconnect
the common-mode sensing capacitor.
(4.1.2) Bootstrapped Switch
The bootstrapped switch shown in Fig.
10 is utilized in the proposed S/H circuit. The
circuitry is a modified version of that
presented in [6]. In the circuit presented in [6],
the voltage at the drain side of the main
switch M11 must be always higher than that at
