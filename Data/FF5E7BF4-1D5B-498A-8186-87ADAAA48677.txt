[24] for solving the IHCP when no boundary condition 
is prescribed and employed the BEM to find the solu-
tion numerically. Besides, Al-Najem et al. [25] used the 
singular value decomposition (SVD) with BEM and the 
least-squares scheme with integral transform method to 
copy with two-dimensional steady-state IHCPs. Shen 
[26] even used two BEMs, a collocation method and a 
weighted one, to solve the IHCP. Moreover, Singh and 
Tanaka [27] also presented an application of the dual 
reciprocity boundary element method (DRBEM) in 
conjunction with iterative regularization for the solu-
tion of time-dependent IHCPs. Based on the dual re-
ciprocity boundary element along with sequential func-
tion specification approach, Behbahani-nia and 
Kowsary [28] have recently proposed a method to deal 
with two-dimensional IHCPs involving unknown time 
and space varying boundary heat flux estimation. Since 
there is no need on domain discretization in the BEM, 
the location of interior points, in which the temperature 
data are gathered, can be selected in a rather arbitrary 
way [29]. Note that Ochiai and Sladek [30] have re-
cently proposed a numerical treatment of domain inte-
grals in three-dimensional boundary integral formula-
tions which is without the need to discretize the interior 
of the domain especially for thermal stress analysis 
with arbitrary internal heat generation. Comparing with 
those mesh-dependent methods like FEM and BEM, 
the meshless methods [31, 32], which do not require 
any domain or boundary discretization, have been pro-
posed. In general, applications of the BEM in this field 
decreases the computational time and capacity re-
quirement but the problem of numerical stability still 
exists. 
The IHCP in thermodynamics is also treated by dif-
ferent workers in computational thermodynamics with 
various numerical schemes. For instance, the wavelets 
method [33-41], the method of quasi-reversibility [42] 
and the Fourier analysis [43-45] have been adopted for 
solving the ill-posed sideways heat equation. Besides, 
Dorai and Tortorelli [46] used the Newton’s method, 
which is superior to the first-order variable metric 
method because of its limited dependence on regulari-
zation and faster convergence, to tackle the IHCP. In 
addition, Eldén [47] and Berntsson [48] employed time 
differencing combined with a “method of lines” for 
solving numerically the initial value problem in the 
space variable. This approach was proposed as an al-
ternative way of implementing space-marching meth-
ods for the sideways heat equation. Examples of this 
are also found in the works of [49]. In addition, Taler 
and Zima [50] have employed the control volume algo-
rithm to solve IHCP and Blanc et al. [42] also provided 
a step by step guide to facilitate the use of the function 
specification method for 2D IHCPs. Furthermore, an 
iterative method [51], the sequential approach [52-54] 
and the approximate inverse scheme [55] were devel-
oped for reconstructing the solutions of IHCPs. 
In our previous paper [56], we solved the above in-
verse heat conduction problem by an extension of the 
group preserving scheme, which was originally devel-
oped by Liu [57] to solve non-linear dynamical equa-
tions. 
In this report, we will extend the Lie-group shooting 
method, which is employed for boundary value prob-
lems as primitively developed by Liu [57-59] for direct 
problems, to the sideways heat equation by pondering a 
space-direction shooting of the final conditions. The 
major contributions made in this report are the apply-
ing of group preserving property of the resultant sys-
tem in developing an effective numerical scheme and 
giving a persuasion that the proposed scheme is supe-
rior to the GPS, the Euler scheme and the fourth-order 
Runge-Kutta method. More noteworthily, the proposed 
scheme is easy to implement and time saving. Through 
this report, we find that the Lie-group scheme pos-
sesses a great advantage over other numerical ap-
proaches because of its group structure. Numerical 
results are provided to show the validity of our pro-
posed method. The accuracy of the proposed scheme is 
much better than the Euler scheme, and it may over the 
fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. 
 
3. Inverse problem statement  
In many industrial applications, we may want to de-
termine the temperature on the surface of a body, but 
the surface itself is inaccessible for a measurement. It 
may also be the case that locating a measurement de-
vice on the surface would disturb the measurements so 
that an incorrect temperature is recorded. In such cases 
one is restricted to internal measurements. 
The sideways heat equation is a model of a situation 
that when the temperature data from a measurement 
device located inside a body is available, we attempt to 
decide the outside temperature of the body. Here we 
are concerned with the numerical solutions of 
,0     0,           , ≥≥≥= txTT xxt lν            (1) 
with boundary conditions: 
,0    ),(),(    ),()(0, 0 ≥== ttFtTtFtT ll          (2) 
and initial condition: 
0,          ),(,0)( ≥≥= xxxT lf    (3) 
where ν is the thermal conductivity of a 
heat-conducting rod with length l. 
When it is impossible to measure the temperature on 
the surface directly, the sideways heat equation often 
occurs in engineering appliances, in which one wants 
to resolve the surface temperature from measurements 
inside a heat-conducting object. The problem setup 
with its physical model is shown in Fig. 1. Suppose 
that we can insert a thermocouple inside the rod to 
measure the temperature at a position x = a < l, and the 
data is denoted by 
.0     ),(),( ≥= ttFtaT m                       (4) 
The inverse problem is thus to decide the temperature 
field inside the rod by using Eqs. (1)-(4). 
  When we want to recover the temperature on the 
other side at x = l, we can use the solution of the above 
problem. However, this problem is ill-posed in the 
sense that the solution does not depend continuously on 
the data given or measured. Therefore, we first trans-
form Eq. (1) to the following equations:

that of GPS, Euler and RK4 in a partial range. 
Furthermore, we make a comparison of the numeri-
cal errors of GPS, Euler and RK4 schemes in Tables 1 
and 2 for three values of a = 0.01, 0.1 m with ν = 1, 1.5 
W/mK and for different grid spacing lengths and time 
step sizes. The errors are defined by the absolute values 
of the differences of numerical solutions to the exact 
solution u(x, t) at x = 1 and t = 1 sec. From Table 1, it 
can be seen that the errors of LGSM are less than those 
of the GPS, Euler and RK4 schemes for all cases. As 
can been seen, the errors of the Euler scheme are re-
duced when the time step sizes decrease or when the 
grid spacing lengths decrease. But these are not true for 
RK4.  
In the cases of the input data polluted by random 
noises, we are concerned with the robustness of our 
numerical schemes. We use the function RAN-
DOM_NUMBER given in Fortran to generate the 
noisy data R(i), in which R(i) are random numbers in [0, 
1]. Then, we select the noise intensity σ to simulate the 
measurement error obtained from multiplying the 
measurement data by (1 + σR(i)). The numerical solu-
tions of LGSM with σ = 1% random noise effect on the 
boundary data and those without random noise effect 
and their errors are plotted in Fig. 4 at x = 1. The pa-
rameters ,, tx ΔΔ and measuring position a are 0.02, 
0.01, and 0.1, respectively. Then, we imposed the ran-
dom noise σ = 1% on the boundary data at a = 0.01, 0.1 
m with ν = 1, 1.5 W/mK. The numerical errors of 
LGSM with random noise effect σ = 1%, those with 
random noise effect on the boundary data and those 
without random noise effect are plotted in Fig. 5. Even 
under the disturbance of random noise, our scheme is 
still performing very well and obtains accurate results. 
 
7. Conclusions 
  The inverse heat conduction problems have been 
evaluated by the formulation with a semi-discretization 
of the time coordinate of sideways heat equation in 
conjunction with the LGSM along the spatial direction. 
Therefore, we can solve them through a minimum so-
lution in a compact space of .1) ,0(∈r  Several nu-
merical examples of the IHCP are worked out, which 
ensure that our approach has a fast convergence speed 
on the solution of r in a pre-selected range smaller than 
(0, 1) by employing the minimum norm to fit the target 
equations, which usually needs only a small number of 
trials to pick the best r. Numerical results represent that 
the LGSM is efficient to numerically integrating the 
sideways heat equation and is also better than RK4. 
The numerical behavior of LGSM is very unlike that of 
the numerical methods, e.g., GPS, RK4 and the Euler 
scheme. In addition, under a reasonable time stepsize 
and grid spacing length, the LGSM can produce a good 
result. The efficiency of LGSM is rooted in the closure 
property of the Lie group that we used it to construct 
the numerical method for IHCP. Even using noisy data, 
the LGSM is also robust enough to estimate the final 
data. Through this report, it can be realized that the 
new shooting algorithm is useful, easy-to-handle, ac-
curate and stable. Particularly, when the thermocouple 
is mounted in a position far away from the surface for a 
safety reason, the LGSM provided computational re-
sults much better than others.
