ABSTRACT 
 
This project mainly studies the parallel distributed 
compensation (PDC) controller synthesis for fuzzy 
systems with time-varying delay state, which is 
represented in Takagi Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy models 
with delay state. Sufficient stability conditions are 
firstly presented for the unforced fuzzy systems. By 
involving the PDC controller, we then propose a 
design condition for the resulting closed-loop fuzzy 
system. These explicit criteria will be formulated in 
terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). By 
current LMI solvers, we can systematically design 
a stabilizing PDC controller from a set of feasible 
solutions. A numerical example is given to 
demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective 
and valid.

I. INTRODUCTION 
 
The fuzzy control can be categorized into two 
distinct classes, the so-called Mamdani type and 
the T-S type, according to the consequence parts of 
the fuzzy rules. It can be represented for nonlinear 
systems or uncertain system by appropriate 
transformation [1]-[3]. Recently, Tanaka and 
Sugeno [4], [5] proposed a stability condition for 
the T-S fuzzy model and sequentially involved the 
concepts of the fuzzy control, “parallel distributed 
compensation (PDC)” [3]. Thereafter, T-S fuzzy 
model has attracted considerable attention in this 
community work, e.g., [6]-[11], and references 
therein. 
In most industrial and engineering systems, delay 
and uncertainty are not avoided [12], [13]. Since 
delay and uncertainty in industrial plant are main 
sources of instability, oscillations, or degraded 
performances. Therefore, the problems of stability 
and stabilization of uncertain time-delay systems 
have been addressed over the years, e.g., [14]- [16], 
and references therein. In [17] and [18], the 
stability analysis and synthesis of T-S fuzzy 
models are extended to that of T-S fuzzy models 
with delay state, which can describe a large class of 
nonlinear systems or uncertain time-delay systems. 
Thus, the stability and stabilization of nonlinear 
time-delay systems can tractability be tackled via 
T-S fuzzy models with delay state. 
In this project, we address the PDC synthesis for 
the T-S fuzzy models with delay state. Based on 
Lyapunov-Krasovskii theorem, stability and design 
condition will be presented and represented in 
terms of LMIs, and the current LMI solver [19] is 
useful for searching feasible solutions. The 
remainder content is organized as follows. In 
section II, the concerned problem is presented and 
formulated. Based on Lyapunov-Krasovskii 
theorem, sufficient conditions for the unforced 
fuzzy systems are firstly derived in section III. The 
controller synthesis of the resulting closed-loop 
systems is then presented in section IV. In section 
V, a numerical example demonstrates the 
effectiveness and validity of the proposed method. 
At length, concluded remarks are collected in 
section VI.

IV. RELIABLE SYNTHESIS OF THE 
CLOSED-LOOP FUZZY SYSTEM 
By involving PDC control, the following control 
inputs are utilized in the fuzzy system (1). 
Control inputs: 
Rule i: If )(1 tθ  is iM 1  and )(2 tθ  is iM 2  
and … )(tpθ  is ipM , 
      Then  )()( txKtu i−= ,        i = 1, 2, ..., r.

VI. CONCLUSIONS 
In this project, the PDC synthesis of fuzzy 
systems with time-varying delay, which were 
represented in T-S fuzzy models with delay state, 
was studied. Based on Lyapunov-Krasovskii 
theorem, the explicit stability and design 
conditions, represented in terms of LMI’s, were 
derived. Thus, a stabilizing PDC controller was 
readily achieved from a set of the feasible solutions
