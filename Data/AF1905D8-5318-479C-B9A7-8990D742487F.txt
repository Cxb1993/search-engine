and in ViVo.5 The biological performances of dendrimer-
based gene delivery systems depend heavily on their mo-
lecular architecture. For example, processes activated in
solvolytic heat-degradation treatment significantly improve
dendrimer transfection activity.6-8 Activated dendrimers are
more flexible structures that are compact in a DNA complex
and swell when released from the DNA complex.7
Cationic dendrimers induce multiple biological effects in
Vitro and in ViVo. The intrinsic antitumor property of cationic
PPI dendrimers synergistically improves the therapeutic
effects of anticancer gene therapy.9,10 Cationic dendrimers,
when delivering plasmid and small interfering RNA (siRNA),
cause marked global gene expression changes in human
cells.11-13 The gene expression altered by dendrimers
includes defense responses, cell proliferation, and apoptosis.
Cationic PPI dendrimers in DNA complexes (dendriplexes)
altered gene expression profiles.11 Also, differences in the
structural architecture of the dendrimers have opposing
effects on targeted gene expression.12 The extent of den-
drimer-induced gene expression changes depends on the
dendrimer’s architecture and on the cell type.11 Understand-
ing the influences and consequences of dendrimer-induced
gene changes should help us design and develop gene-based
delivery systems.
The primary objective of this study was to explore, using
high-density microarray analysis, the alteration of whole
genomic responses in human cervical HeLa cancer cells
treated with nonactivated (intact) and activated PAMAM
dendrimers alone or with their dendriplexes.
Materials and Methods
Materials. Starburst PAMAM dendrimer (Generation 5
(PAMAM 5.0; MW 28826 Da; 128 N-terminal amines)) was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals (St. Louis, MO).
PAMAM dendrimers were supplied in methanol, which was
removed using vacuum evaporation, and stored with phos-
phate buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C. The activated dendrimers
were prepared at a concentration of 2 mg/mL in a 50 °C
water bath for the times indicated. pDNA (pSG5lacZ, 8 Kb),
which encodes the lacZ gene for -galactosidase, was driven
by a SV40 promoter to assess gene expression. pSG5lacZ
was amplified in Escherichia coli and purified using column
chromatography (NucleoBond PC 2000; Macherey-Nagel
GmbH & Co., Du¨ren, Germany). The purity of pSG5lacZ
was established using ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy (E260
nm/E280 nm ratio; range: 1.80-1.90). All other chemicals
were of the highest grade available and were purchased
locally.
Cell Culture. A human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa)
was maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium
(Gibco DMEM; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco FBS;
Invitrogen) and 100 U/mL of penicillin/100 µg/mL strepto-
mycin (Sigma-Aldrich) in a humidified atmosphere of 5%
CO2 at 37 °C.
Cytotoxicity Assay. The activity of dehydrogenases (an
indicator of cell viability) in the cells (treated or untreated
with dendrimers, alone, or their DNA complexes) was
simultaneously assessed. Negative control cells contained no
PAMAM or their DNA complexes. The incubation condi-
tions of cells were the same as the incubation conditions of
the transfection assay described in the next section. To
measure cell viability, 10 µL of a cell-counting kit solution,
a tetrazolium salt that produces a highly water-soluble
formazan dye upon biochemical reduction in the presence
of an electron carrier (1-methoxy PMS) (Cell Counting Kit-
8; Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan), was added to
a 100 µL culture medium and incubated for 4 h. The amount
of yellow formazan dye generated by dehydrogenases in cells
is directly proportional to the number of viable cells in a
culture medium. The absorbance at 450 nm was obtained
using an ELISA reader with a reference wavelength of 595
nm. Results are reported as the cell viability percentage
(average optical density (OD)/average negative-control OD)
( standard deviation (SD).
Transfection Assay. Cells were seeded into 24-well cell-
culture plates at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well and grown
overnight (60% to 75% confluence). Immediately before
transfection, the cells were rinsed with PBS and supple-
mented with 1 mL of fresh DMEM per well. The pDNA (5
µg) and a range of concentrations of intact or activated
PAMAM were each diluted into 500 µL of DMEM solution.
PAMAM dendrimers were added to the pDNA solution at

DNA (5 µg/mL) complexes (Figure 1). Cell viability was
above 80% at the intact PAMAM dendrimer concentrations
of 10 and 15 µg/mL but below 80% at 30 and 50 µg/mL.
Cell viability was above 80% until 50 µg/mL for intact
dendriplexes (Figure 1). The negative charge of DNA
neutralized the positive charge of the PAMAM dendrimers
and increased cell viability. The intact PAMAM dendrimers
were then activated for 8, 16, and 24 h, after which they
were analyzed using cytotoxic assays (Figure 1). The cell
viability of activated PAMAM dendrimers under all incuba-
tion conditions was at best comparable and slightly more
cytotoxic than that of their nonactivated counterparts.
Transfection Assay. We examined the in Vitro gene
expression of intact dendriplexes (5 µg/mL of DNA plus 10,
15, 30, or 50 µg/mL of nonactivated PAMAM) incubated
for 24 h (Figure 2A). Gene expression using intact dendri-
plexes was more efficient than using naked DNA alone.
Maximum transfection activity occurred at 15 µg/mL (Figure
2A). Taking into account transfection efficiency and cyto-
toxicity, 15 µg/mL of intact PAMAM dendrimers were
selected and heated for different times, after which they were
combined in complexes with 5 µg/mL of DNA, and then
transfection activity was assessed (Figure 2B). Heating intact
PAMAM dendrimers for 16 h yielded the maximum levels
of gene expression (cell viability ) 84 ( 3%), whereas
transfection activity remained unchanged after 8 h of heating,
and gene expression decreased after 24 h of heating (Figure
2B). Therefore, we chose 15 µg/mL PAMAM dendrimers
(intact and activated for 16 h) and dendriplexes for microar-
ray analysis.
Light Scattering and Zeta Potential Analysis. The mean
diameter of 15 µg/mL intact PAMAM/5 µg/mL DNA
dendriplexes was 177 ( 24 nm with a narrow distribution
(polydispersity index (PI) ) 0.16; n ) 3). We found a smaller
mean particle size (108 ( 16 nm; n ) 3) and slightly broader
distribution (PI ) 0.21) for 15 µg/mL activated PAMAM/5
µg/mL DNA dendriplexes. The zeta potentials were com-
parable between 15 µg/mL intact PAMAM/5 µg/mL DNA
dendriplexes (12 ( 2 mV; n ) 3) and 15 µg/mL activated
PAMAM (16 h heating)/5 µg/mL DNA dendriplexes (11 (
2 mV; n ) 3).
Global Gene Expression Profiles of HeLa Cells
Treated with Intact and Activated Dendrimers Alone
or with Their Dendriplexes. Activated PAMAM dendrimers
alone and their dendriplexes produced more upregulated and
downregulated genes than did intact dendrimers alone and
their dendriplexes (Figure 3). Intact dendrimers and their
dendriplexes produced similar numbers of upregulated genes,
but intact dendrimers produced more downregulated genes

and their dendriplexes and activated PAMAM dendrimers
on HeLa cells by measuring generated dehydrogenases.
Negative control cells were grown without adding either
intact dendrimers and their dendriplexes or activated
dendrimers. Data are cell viability percentages (aver-
age OD/average negative control OD) ( standard
deviation (SD) (n ) 3).

use in cancer cells.9 One microarray analysis11 showed that,
in human A431 cells, cationic PPI dendrimers induced
changes in the expression of a variety of gene ontologies,
including those involved in defense responses, cell prolifera-
tion, and apoptosis, which might have been related to their
antitumor effects. Furthermore, the patterns of global gene
expression were dramatically changed when PPI dendrimers
were bound in complexes with plasmid DNA. It is, therefore,

Using dendrimers in ViVo has significant potential in
gene-delivery cancer therapy. Two early in ViVo studies22,23
reported that activated PAMAM dendrimer-mediated
angiostatin and metalloproteinase (TMP)-2 inhibited tumor
growth and angiogenesis, and that gene delivery of Fas
ligand by activated PAMAM dendrimers induced signifi-
cant growth suppression and apoptotic tumor cell death
in prostate cancer. Interestingly, like polypropylenimine
dendrimers, activated PAMAM dendrimers alone also
delayed tumor growth, but only polypropylenimine den-
driplexes lead to a significant regression of tumors.9 Our
results from exploring the gene-expression profiles of
dendrimers and dendriplexes might allow a more detailed
insight for understanding their molecular mechanisms in
cancer cells. Our results showed that activated dendrimers
and dendriplexes induced marked global gene-expression
changes in cancer cells. We found that genes involved in
cell proliferation and immune responses were altered by
activated dendrimers and dendriplexes, a finding consistent
with their direct antitumor effect. Besides that, genes
involved in various cellular processes, such as nucleic acid
binding and transcription activity, metal-ion binding,
enzyme activity, receptor activity, and protein binding,
were also altered. Furthermore, the extent of gene changes
was different between activated dendrimers and activated
dendriplexes, which explains their variable antitumor
effects in cancer cells. Our findings suggested that a
successful vector for cancer gene therapy might be
designed to have desirable molecular functions, such as
an antitumor activity, optimal transfection efficiency, and
minimal cytotoxicity.
Finally, the transfection efficiency results of nonviral gene
delivery systems depend upon overcoming extra- and intra-
cellular barriers involved in gene delivery. Once the gene
delivery systems are at the targeted tumor cells, there are
still several intracellular barriers: internalization, endosomal
escape, cytoplasm trafficking, nuclear translocation, and
transcription. We found that activated and nonactivated
dendriplexes principally affected genes with the molecular
functions of nucleic acid binding and transcription activity,
metal-ion binding, enzyme activity, receptor activity, and
protein binding. We hypothesize that the genes involved in
nucleic acid binding and transcription activity are a major
factor that directly leads to the transfection efficiency of
dendriplexes. Because we used in our study the same plasmid
that was used in previous studies,9,10,22,23 we conclude that
dendrimer architecture is important for regulating transcrip-
tion processes. Nonviral vectors compact DNA so efficiently
that transcription processes are hindered.24 It has been
reported25 that PAMAM dendrimers inhibited the initiation
of transcription in Vitro but did not affect the elongation of
the RNA transcript. However, activated dendrimers are
reported7 to undergo DNA decondensation after swelling,
to be more flexible structures than intact dendrimers, and,
therefore, to increase transfection efficiency. We found that
activated dendriplexes have more regulated genes involved
in transcription processes than intact ones, and that this may
assist the activities of transcription factors and reach the
ultimate goal of transgene expression.
Conclusion
In summary, our results illustrate the importance of the
molecular architecture of the dendrimers on the effect of
global gene expression profiles in HeLa cells. Dendrimers
and dendriplexes induced gene expression changes; some of
the dendrimer-induced expression changes were the same
as dendriplex-induced expression changes. Activating den-
drimers led to higher transfection efficiencies and induced
more gene expression changes in cancer cells. Dendrimers
and dendriplexes principally affect genes via the molecular
functions of nucleic acid binding and transcription activity,
metal-ion binding, enzyme activity, receptor activity, and
protein binding. We hypothesize that a successful vector for
cancer gene therapy may be designed to have desirable
molecular functions, such as antitumor activity, optimal
transfection efficiency, and minimal cytotoxicity.

reactions were done on a thermal cycler (LightCycler 
Instrument 1.5; Roche Diagnostics Australia Pty. Ltd., 
Australia) using a kit (LightCycler FastStart DNA 
MasterPlus SYBR Green I, Cat. 03 515 885 001; Roche). 
Each sample was run in triplicate. The real-time PCR 
program steps were 95°C for 10 min, 50 cycles of 95°C for 
10 s, 60°C for 15 s, and 72°C for 10 s. Five genes (FOS, 
OSM, C1R, TNF, IL1R1) were investigated using the 
following primer sequences: FOS sense 
CTACCACTCACCCGCAGACT and antisense 
AGGTCCGTGCAGAAGTCCT; OSM sense 
GTGGATGAGAGGAACCATCG and antisense 
GTAGCAGAGGGGAACAGGTTT; CIR sense 
TGCTCAACTACGTGGACTGG and antisense 
GATTCGAACCTAGTGAATTCTGG; TNF sense 
CAGCCTCTTCTCCCCTTCGAT and antisense 
GCCAGAGGGCTGATTAGAGA; IL1R1 sense 
ATTGTGCTTTGGTACAGGGATTCC and antisense 
ATGCGTCATAGGTCTTTCCATCTG. Human TBP 
(TATA box binding protein) was used as the reference 
gene. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
We used 1.5-fold changes at one of three time points 
(0 h, 0.5 h, and 4 h) to select 4386 differentially expressed 
genes from 28,060 identified genes; cluster analysis was 
then used for additional analysis. We found 11 clusters  
with significant gene-expression changes. The 
majority of these genes with significant gene expression 
changes at each time point (0.5 h and 4 h) were 
upregulated (Table 1); 35 upregulated genes responded to 
the stimuli with immune functions in all 11 clusters and 
were also selected (Table 2). These genes included mostly 
cytokines, cytokine binding proteins, cytokine receptors, 
receptors, histocompatibility molecules, chemokines, 
complement components, CD8 antigens, pore-forming 
proteins, oncogenes, proteases, and phospholipases. To 
compare the gene expression results obtained from the 
microarray with the results from RT-PCR, five genes (FOS, 
OSM, C1R, TNF, IL1R1) at each time point (Table 2) were 
tested. We found that the regulation patterns of the five 
genes, as measured by RT-PCR, were consistent with those 
from the microarray. 
CONCLUSION 
R8 induced various changes in gene expression in 
macrophages after it had bound with and was internalized 
by them. Our study may provide helpful information for 
the molecular mechanisms of R8-induced immune 
responses in macrophages
