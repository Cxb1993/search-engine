Maintaining reconstructed signal with desired quality is crucial for ECG data compression. In 
this report, a linear quality control design based on the Reversible Round-Off Non-Recursive 
Discrete Periodized Wavelet Transform (RRO-NRDPWT) is proposed for high efficient 
wavelet-based ECG data compression. With the advantages of error propagation resistance and 
octave coefficient normalization, RRO-NRDPWT enables the non-linear quantization control to 
obtain an approximately linear distortion by using a single control variable. Based on the linear 
programming, a linear quantization scale prediction model is presented for the quality control of 
reconstructed ECG signal. Following the use of the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, the 
experimental results show that the proposed system, with lower computational complexity, can 
obtain much better quality control performance than that of other wavelet-based systems.  
 
Nonlinear Quantization Scheme with Linear Distortion Characteristic 
Essentially, error control loop is an iterative quantization process that keeps going to refine the 
quantization scales of all decomposition levels until the distortion locates in a tolerable region. To 
achieve the refining process, a quantization scale prediction algorithm is necessary. Linear 
prediction model is the most efficient algorithm due to simplicity. Nevertheless, linear prediction 
can be only suitable for linear distortion behavior. For this aim, based on the 1-D RRO-NRDPWT, 
a modified non-linear quantization scheme derived from [30] was developed. The quantization 
scale design was conducted by three criterions: 1) using single variable to determine the 
quantization scales of all decomposition levels, 2) keeping the relationship between distortion and 
control variable to be linear, and 3) decreasing the gradient of PRD-CR curve, especially at high 
CR situation.  
Let *jd  be a vector encompassing reversible wavelet coefficients of the jth level. The 
quantization process can be defined as

where  d )( * jtr denotes the truncation process that truncates each element of *jd  to an 
integer, DCb  and jc  are quantization scales of the jth level. In inverse quantization process, 
each retrieved datum will be compensated with the half of the quantization scale, namely,

101, 102, 103, 107, 109, 111, 115, 117, 118, and 119 recoded in the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database 
(360 samples/sec and 11 bits resolution) was built. Each signal contains about 10-min length of 
sampled data. These signals involving all possible variations of ECG signals were suggested in [12] 
and [14]. Applying the 6-tap Daubechies’ filter to the 1-D RRO-NRDPWT, the two compression 
methods using truncation and round-off processes are referred to as NRDPWT-6t and NRDPWT-6r, 
respectively. Every segment involves 1024 samples of ECG data. A segment data are decomposed 
into ten levels. The experimental result is shown in Table I where NRDPWT-6t is better than 
NRDPWT-6r with the PRD improved by 2.81% in average, except for CR=20. As compared with 
the SPIHT scheme [14], the NRDPWT-6t can improve the average PRD by 
65.18100)348.2/)910.1348.2(( =− (%) and 18.39% for the two ranges 4 ≤ CR ≤ 12 and 14 ≤ CR ≤ 
20, respectively. 
In the experiment of quality control, all the 48 ECG signals recorded in the MIT-BIH arrhythmia 
database are used. Each signal also contains 10-min length sampled data. The compressed data file 
consists of a QF value and quantized ECG data where the former is encoded by the DPCM method 
and the later are encoded with lossless SPIHT scheme. Considering two tolerable bounds, %5=ε  
and %10=ε , the quality control performance are evaluated in Table II. Table II shows that average 
iterations is less than three and trends to increase as TPRD  is increased. This phenomenon will be 
detailedly discussed in section VI. Using the ECG signal MIT-BIH record 212, a quality control 
result of the proposed system with %5=ε  is demonstrated in Figs. 6-8 for =TPRD  3%, 6%, 
and 9%, respectively, where the first 316 segments (15-min length) is shown. The corresponding 
quality control performance is given in Table III where the rate is represented with bit per second 
(bps). The parameter QF∆  defined as the QF difference between two adjacent segments indicates 
that the representation of QF requires 5 bits for DPCM codec.  
The methods proposed in [6] and [7] are threshold-based approaches that applies quality 
control strategy for threshold value determination. The quality control performance was
