2中文摘要
暗發酵的生物產氫過程總是伴隨著乙酸與丁酸的大量生成。因此，氫發酵後的出
流廢水富含有機酸和殘餘的碳水化合物。這樣的廢水若無適當的處理而直接排放
到水體，必會對環境造成負擔，因此，有必要進一步處理甚至回收該出流廢水中
的有機酸和碳水化合物。本研究的目的乃要探討轉化氫發酵出流中的有機酸和碳
水化合物為醇類的潛力。本研究裡，蔗糖 10 g / L 和丁酸 2 g / L 被用來模擬真實
的氫發酵出流廢水。實驗結果得到最大的丁醇、丙酮以及乙醇濃度分別為 3500，
2000 和 1000 mg/L。此結果證實，丁醇在丙酮-丁醇-乙醇發酵(ABE fermentation)
的過程為主要的產物。在探索有機酸存在對丁醇-丙酮-乙醇發酵的研究觀察到，
Clostridium beijerinckii 在 solventogenesis 相，將 1,500 mg/L 的丁酸轉化而產生丁
醇。此外，調查亦發現 700 mg/L 的乙酸也會逐步的被攝取而轉化為醇類。然而，
其他的研究報告卻與本研究持相反的結論，他們的結果指出乙酸不會被利用。除
了有機酸的影響外，pH 值的變化大大影響了 Clostridium beijerinckii 的代謝機
制。在 pH 值從 5.0 到 5.2 時，Clostridium beijerinckii 主要在 solventogenesis 相利
用蔗糖、乙酸與丁酸轉化生成醇類。然而，當 pH 值上升至 5.8，代謝反應由
solventogenesis 相朝 acidogenesis 相轉變。歸納而言，本研究顯示了產醇 Clostridia
以有機酸與碳水化合物為基質生產醇類的潛力。因此，以氫發酵反應器所排放的
出流廢水作為回收丁醇的來源極具潛力。

41. Introduction
There has been an intensive research interest on biorenewable energy production in
the worldwide. In particular, acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation has been
regained lots of attentions lately due to energy shortage and environmental concern.
The ratio of acetone to butanol to ethanol typically is 3:6:1 in ABE fermentation,
where butanol is the major species. One of the superior properties of butanol is that
butanol contains 30% more energy than ethanol but only 5% less than gasoline.
Butanol becomes a potential substitute to replace fossil fuel. Solvent-producing
Clostridia produced hydrogen, acetate and butyrate at an exponential growth phase;
whereas, the metabolism shifted to solventogenesis for ABE production during the
stationary phase in batch culture. It found that these acids can be reutilized to form
acetone, butanol and ethanol (Afschar et al., 1986; Brosseau et al., 1986). Hartmanis
et al. (1984) confirmed the result of uptake of butyrate to form butanol by Clostridium
acetobutylicum ATCC 824. In the later study, Tashiro et al. (2004) investigated
butanol production from a mixture of butyrate and glucose by Clostridium
saccharoperbutylacetonicum N1-4 in a pH-stat fed-batch reactor. In addition, a
study reported butanol production by Clostridium beijerinckii BA101 would be
increased by the addition of acetate (Chen and Blaschek, 1999). It has been well
known that biohydrogen production through dark fermentation is always accompanied
with acetate and butyrate productions. The effluent also contained significant
amounts of residual carbohydrates while hydrogen-producing reactor was being
operated at short hydraulic retention time (Chen et al., 2009). Therefore, there is a
need to treat or reutilize the residual carbohydrates and organic acids before discharge.
The purpose of the study was to evaluate the potential of butanol production from the
effluent of hydrogen-producing reactor. The effect of butyrate concentrations on
butanol concentration was investigated.
2. Materials and Methods
Culture development and Experimental methods
Clostridium beijerinckii was developed in a sterilized peptone-yeast extract-glucose
(PYG) medium under anaerobic condition for 24 h at 35±1ºC. The developed
cultures were inoculated into a 500 mL batch reactor to carry out the experiment of
butanol production. The sterilized medium in the batch reactor mainly composed of
3.33 mL of nutrient solution, 100 ml of acetate buffer solution, and substrate. Each
liter of acetate buffer was consisted with 357 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid and 643 mL of
0.1 M sodium acetate. The composition of nutrient solution was described
6Clostridium beijerinckii assimilated butyrate to form butanol during ABE
fermentation. However, it found that butyrate concentration began increased to
1,000 mg/L in the end of fermentation. It describes that acidogenesis was more
dominated than solventogenesis in this stage. This was mainly due to the increase of
pH (described in the follow) by producing solvents derived the metabolism shifting to
acidogenesis. In addition to butyrate concentration, acetate concentration was also
gradually decreased from 1,000 mg/L to 300 mg/L. Based on the result, acetate
seems capable to be uptake during ABE fermentation. This find was controversy to
other reports. Apart from the uptake of acetate, acetate concentration was increased
in the end of fermentation because of the prevailing of acidogenesis.

Figure 2. Variation of acid concentration with time at 10 g sucrose/L and 2 g
butyrate/L.
Figure 3 elaborated the changes of pH during ABE fermentation at sucrose of 10 g/L
and butyrate of 2 g/L. As revealed from the figure, the pH was initially dropped
from 5.2 to 5.0, and then remained stable for three days. The decrease of pH was
mainly due to producing acids in the beginning of the fermentation (Figure 2).
However, pH was drastically increased from 5.0 to nearly 5.8 because of the increase
of solvent concentrations (Figure 1) and the reduction of acid concentrations (Figure
2). In the stage, Clostridium beijerinckii was in the phase of solventogenesis for
solvent production. Thereafter, pH 5.8 derived the metabolism shifting from
solventogenesis to acidogenesis which is favored for acid productions (Figure 2). As
a result, the pH was reduced to around 5.4 in the end of fermentation.
