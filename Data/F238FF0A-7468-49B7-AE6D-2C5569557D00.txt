Abstract 
  Based on the Lyapunov stability theorem, a 
methodology of designing the robust block 
backstepping controllers for a class of multi-input 
multi-output MIMO) systems with matched and 
mismatched perturbations is proposed in this paper. 
The proposed technique can be divided into two steps. 
The first step is the design of virtual input controllers, 
the second step is the design of robust controllers. Due 
to some adaptive mechanisms embedded in both the 
virtual input and robust controllers, not only are the 
mismatched perturbations suppressed, but also the 
knowledge of upper bound of perturbation is not 
required except those of the input uncertainties. 
Furthermore, the property of asymptotical stability is 
achieved. Finally, a numerical example is used to 
demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed 
methodology.

二、緣由與目的 
  According to the state space spanned by the input 
gain matrix, one can divide the perturbations of the 
system into two parts, one is the matched part, which 
is in the range space of input gain matrix [1]. The rest 
of the perturbations belong to mismatched part, which 
is not in the range space of input gain matrix. For 
controlling the systems with matched perturbations, 
the sliding mode control (SMC) technique provides an 
effective tool to achieve the properties of both robust 
stability and insensitivity of matched perturbations [2]. 
However, if the control systems contain the 
mismatched perturbations, these perturbations may 
still affect the dynamics of the controlled systems 
during the sliding mode [3]. For controlling MIMO 
systems with mismatched perturbations, many works 
have recently been developed to solve the regulation 
or stabilization problems. Without the knowledge of 
the upper bound of perturbations, Wu and Zhou [4] 
designed an output feedback controller so that the 
dynamics of the controlled MIMO nonlinear system 
are uniformly ultimately bounded. Lin and Qian [5] 
proposed the partial state and output feedback 
controllers; Liu et al. [6] designed a H∞ controller 
and applied it to a class of chemical plants. Yao and 
Tomizuka [7], Liu et al. [8] designed the 
backstepping controllers for a class of MIMO 
nonlinear systems. Although the works proposed in 
[5,7,8] can be employed for MIMO systems to achieve 
asymptotical stability, however, some controlled 
systems [5,6] had to be in strict feedback forms, and 
assumed that there exists a positive definite and proper 
Lyapunov function. Some control systems [4-8] 
required the knowledge of the upper bounded of 
perturbations. In recent years many researchers used 
backstepping technique to design robust controllers for 
systems with perturbations. Backstepping is a 
recursive procedure that interlaces the choice of a 
Lyapunov function with the design of feedback control 
[9]. One advantage of this technique is that it can 
circumvent the problem of mismatched perturbations 
and achieve the property of asymptotical stability. The 
other advantage is that it can exploit some extra 
flexibility that exists with lower order systems. Among 
these research, Zhang et al. [10] proposed a 
backstepping controller for a class of time-delay 
systems with mismatched perturbation. Praly [11] 
designed an observer and adaptive rules to achieve

Design of Robust Block Backstepping Controllers for Systems with
Mismatched Perturbations
Chih-Chiang Cheng, Shih-Hsiang Chien, Yaote Chang
Abstract— Based on the Lyapunov stability theorem, a
methodology of designing the robust block backstepping con-
trollers for a class of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems
with matched and mismatched perturbations is proposed in
this paper. The proposed technique can be divided into two
steps. The first step is the design of virtual input controllers,
the second step is the design of robust controllers. Due to
some adaptive mechanisms embedded in both the virtual
input and robust controllers, not only are the mismatched
perturbations suppressed, but also the knowledge of upper
bound of perturbation is not required except those of the
input uncertainties. Furthermore, the property of asymptotical
stability is achieved. Finally, a numerical example is used to
demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed methodology.
I. INTRODUCTION
According to the state space spanned by the input gain
matrix, one can divide the perturbations of the system into
two parts, one is the matched part, which is in the range
space of input gain matrix [1]. The rest of the perturbations
belong to mismatched part, which is not in the range space of
input gain matrix. For controlling the systems with matched
perturbations, the sliding mode control (SMC) technique
provides an effective tool to achieve the properties of both
robust stability and insensitivity of matched perturbations [2].
However, if the control systems contain the mismatched per-
turbations, these perturbations may still affect the dynamics
of the controlled systems during the sliding mode [3].
For controlling MIMO systems with mismatched per-
turbations, many works have recently been developed to
solve the regulation or stabilization problems. Without the
knowledge of the upper bound of perturbations, Wu and
Zhou [4] designed an output feedback controller so that
the dynamics of the controlled MIMO nonlinear system are
uniformly ultimately bounded. Lin and Qian [5] proposed
the partial state and output feedback controllers; Liu et al.
[6] designed a H∞ controller and applied it to a class
of chemical plants. Yao and Tomizuka [7], Liu et al. [8]

nonlinear systems. Although the works proposed in [5,7,8]
can be employed for MIMO systems to achieve asymptotical
stability, however, some controlled systems [5,6] had to be

in strict feedback forms, and assumed that there exists a
positive definite and proper Lyapunov function. Some control
systems [4-8] required the knowledge of the upper bounded
of perturbations.
In recent years many researchers used backstepping tech-
nique to design robust controllers for systems with perturba-
tions. Backstepping is a recursive procedure that interlaces
the choice of a Lyapunov function with the design of
feedback control [9]. One advantage of this technique is that
it can circumvent the problem of mismatched perturbations
and achieve the property of asymptotical stability. The other
advantage is that it can exploit some extra flexibility that
exists with lower order systems. Among these research,
Zhang et al. [10] proposed a backstepping controller for a
class of time-delay systems with mismatched perturbation.
Praly [11] designed an observer and adaptive rules to achieve
asymptotical stability. Zhou [12] utilized the adaptive tech-
nique to obtain asymptotical stability without requiring the
knowledge of upper bound of perturbation. Huang and Chen
[13] combined multi-sliding surface and adaptive technique
to achieve the stability of uniformly ultimate boundedness.
Karagiannis et al. [14] used the small gain theorem to design
an observer for a class of nonminimum phase systems.
However, these works of utilizing backstepping technique
can only apply to some classes of single-input single-output
(SISO) systems with strict feedback forms.
Due to the limitations of each of the methodologies
mentioned above, in this paper we proposed a design method-
ology of adaptive block backstepping controllers for a class
of MIMO systems with mismatched perturbations as well as
matched input uncertainty to solve regulation problems. The
advantages of this methodology are that not only are asymp-
totical stability can still be achieved, but also the knowledge
of the upper bound of perturbations is not required except
those of input uncertainties when designing the controllers.
Finally, a numerical example is demonstrated to show the
applicability of the proposed control scheme.

where g,  = 0, 1, are unknown positive constants, g2 is
a known positive constant satisfying the constraint given
