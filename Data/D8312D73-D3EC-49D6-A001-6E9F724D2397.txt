1. ZnO-MOCVD 
The growth of ZnO was carried out by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) 
system, which was refitted from an Emcore D-180 system for the GaN compound semiconductor 
growth as shown in Figure 1. Photographs show the ZnO-MOCVD which includes control, disc 
reactor, exhaust, heater, chamber, and gas delivery systems. It retains the control system, vacuum 
system and chamber from Emcore D-180. In order to minimize the gas phase reaction which can 
cause the generation of particles and thus degrade the ZnO quality, MO sources and O2 were 
introduced into the reactor separately and mixed immediately before entering into the chamber. 
For the growth of high quality ZnO, the gas flow geometry has been changed because this new 
system could accurately control over the inner, middle and outer gas flow rate. ZDEZn 
[Zn(C2H5)2 (99.9999% purity)] with Ar carrier gas was supplied into the reactor as Zn precursor 
and oxygen gas [O2 (99.999% purity)] was used as oxidizer. High-purity Ar gas passes through 
the DEZn bubbler that is maintained at 17°C and saturates with DEZn vapor to the reactor.

The typical growth conditions were as follows: DEZn bubbler was 
immersed at 17oC, a reactor chamber pressure was 10 Torr, rotation of 
disk was 350 rpm, and a total carrier gas flow was 3000 sccm. 
 
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of ZnO nanostructures grown at 650oC on the 
c-plane sapphire substrate without buffer layer and with ZnO buffer layer are shown in the 
Figures 2(a) and (b). Images show the morphological changes of ZnO nanostructures on the 
sapphire substrate and ZnO buffer layer. It is observed that the ZnO nanostructures grown direct 
on the substrate have an echinus-like morphology while the ZnO nanostructures grown on the 
ZnO buffer layer present vertical well-aligned ZnO nanorod arrays with uniform diameter and 
height. The diameter and height of ZnO nanorod arrays are approximately 40 and 700 nm, 
respectively. Apparently, the ZnO buffer layer provides better nucleation sites for the ZnO 
nanorod arrays growth [11]. After forming a continuous buffer layer as the nucleation sites, the 
ZnO nanorod arrays starts to grow on top of this buffer layer. This ZnO buffer is a key factor in 
promoting the ZnO nanorod arrays to nucleate. It is found that the ZnO tends to grow in random 
orientation without pre-deposition of the ZnO buffer layer. The crystal quality and growth 
orientation are further investigated by XRD technique. Figure 2(c) shows the X-ray diffraction 
(XRD) pattern of ZnO grown directly on the substrate and on the ZnO buffer layer. The XRD 
peaks of ZnO nanorod arrays are ZnO (0002) and Al2O3 (0006) from the left to right. The ZnO 
(0002) peak with 2θ at approximately 34.7o arising from the hexagonal wurtzite structure is 
predominant in ZnO nanorod arrays. This indicates that the ZnO nanorod arrays are highly c-axis 
oriented as well as good vertical aligned on ZnO buffer/sapphire substrate. In addition, the XRD 
(0002) peak intensity of ZnO echinus on sapphire substrate is small because the ZnO do not cover 
the entire surface of sapphire substrate and it grows in random orientation. The result is also in a 
good agreement with the morphologies observed by SEM as shown in the Figures 2(a) and (b).

nanorods grown on 50 nm ZnO buffer layer is vertically well aligned nanorods as shown in the 
inset of Figure 3(e). The density of nanorods increases with increasing buffer layer thickness 
from 10 to 50 nm as shown in Figure 3(b)~(e). With increasing buffer layer thickness to 100 nm, 
the density of nanorods decreases as shown in Figure 3(f).  
 
Figure 3 SEM images of ZnO nanorods with various ZnO buffer layer thicknesses: (a) 
0, (b) 10, (c) 20, (d) 30, (e) 50, and (f) 100 nm. 
 
In order to realize the relationship between the buffer layer and nanorods, the surface 
morphology of ZnO buffer layer with different thicknesses was measured by atomic force 
microscope (AFM) as presented in Figure 4. In Figure 4(a)~(c), the nucleation density of ZnO 
increases with increasing buffer layer thickness from 10 to 50 nm. However, the nucleation 
density of 100 nm ZnO buffer layer decreases and the size of ZnO nuclei changes from small to 
big with increasing buffer layer thickness from 10 to 100 nm. This suggests that the reduced ZnO 
nanorods on 100 nm ZnO buffer layer is due to the decrease of the ZnO nucleation density as 
show in Figure 4(d) [12-14]. The densities of ZnO nanorods as a function of the ZnO buffer layer 
thickness are shown in Figure 4(e). All the buffer layers show a rough surface with a 
three-dimensional island growth and the 50 nm buffer layer has the roughest surface. The root

Room temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy is carried out to assess the optical 
properties of ZnO nanorod arrays. Generally, there are two bands appearing in the room 
temperature PL spectrum of ZnO. The UV near-band-edge (NBE) emission is due to free exciton 
recombination, which has been confirmed by the temperature-dependent PL spectra [16]. In the 
visible region, the deep-level-emission (DLE) can be observed because of the existence of native 
defects such as oxygen vacancies, zinc interstitials and so on [17]. PL spectrum of ZnO nanorod 
arrays grown directly on different buffer layers with the thicknesses ranging from 10 to 100 nm is 
shown in Figure 5. A strong NBE peak and a negligible DLE peak can be observed at the ZnO 
nanorod arrays under all kinds of buffer thickness, which indicates that all ZnO nanorod arrays 
have a good optical quality. With increasing buffer layer thickness from 10 to 50 nm, the 
intensity of the NBE peak increases. The strongest NBE peak of ZnO nanorod arrays is obtained 
with the buffer layer thickness of 50 nm. With increasing buffer layer thickness to 100 nm, the 
NBE peak of ZnO nanorod arrays decreases. In PL measurement, the better optical quality for 
ZnO nanorod arrays on 50 nm buffer can be attributed to the higher ZNRs density. From the 
XRD, SEM, AFM, and PL results, it is found that the buffer layer plays an important role in 
obtaining well-crystalline ZnO nanorod arrays especially under higher growth temperature.

two parts including nucleation and growth. The pre-deposition of ZnO buffer layer helps the ZnO 
to nucleate and leads to the formation of hillocks on the surface of ZnO buffer layer. As 
increasing growth time, the growth of ZnO nanorod arrays starts to perform on the hillock 
structures. The tip of hillocks could work as an activation site for the formation of ZnO nanorod 
arrays because of the difference in surface free energy.

illustration of growth mechanism of ZnO nanorod arrays on ZnO buffer layer via a

Further structural characterization of the single-crystalline grown ZnO nanorod arrays under 
DEZn flow of 40 sccm is investigated by using a transmission electron microscope (TEM), as 
shown in Figure 10(a). The ZnO nanorod has a straight shape and a uniform diameter, which is 
further characterized by a high-resolution-TEM (HR-TEM) and selected area electron diffraction 
(SAED) as illustrated in inset Figure 10(a). The HR-TEM image clearly shows that the ZnO 
nanorod arrays have high crystalline quality in nature and prefer to grow along the (0001) 
direction, which is also consistent well with the XRD analysis. Meanwhile, it is also evident that

In addition, Figure 10(b) shows the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) 
measurement result for the top surface of ZnO nanorod arrays. The EDS result indicates that the 
ZnO nanorod arrays are composed of Zn and O. The Cu peak in Figure 10(b) originates from the 
copper mesh for sustaining the sample during the TEM measurement. The EDS analyses do not 
reveal any metal catalysts or any other type of additives upon the growth of ZnO nanorod arrays. 
Therefore, ZnO nanorod arrays growth is said to follow the self-catalyzed growth mechanism 
instead of metal-catalyzed VLS mechanism. 
 
ZnO Nanotube Arrays 
The MOCVD system was used for the ZnO nanotube arrays growth. Sapphire with (0001) 
orientation was used as a substrate. Diethyl zinc [DEZn; Zn(C2H5)2 (99.9999% purity)] and 
oxygen gas [O2 (99.999% purity)] were used as the source gases. Ar (99.9999% purity) was 
applied as the carrier gas of the DEZn source. The growth methods are discussed in detail in 
Table 2. The ZnO nanotube arrays were fabricated by a three-step growth process as illustrated in 
Figure 11(a). First, the ZnO buffer layer was deposited on the sapphire substrate at 450oC. After 
wards, the sample was heated up to 650oC for the growth of the ZnO nanorod arrays on the ZnO 
buffer layers. After the growth of ZnO nanorod arrays, the sample was cooled down to 450oC and 
then the ZnO nanotube arrays were grown on the ZnO nanorod arrays. Time chart of the 
corresponding MOCVD process and growth parameters of ZnO nanotube arrays are given in 
Figure 11(b).

The typical growth conditions were as follows: DEZn bubbler was 
immersed at 17oC, a reactor chamber pressure was 10 Torr, rotation of 
disk was 350 rpm, and a total carrier gas flow was 3000 sccm.

because the growth temperature decreased to 450oC, which can not supply the sufficient thermal 
energy. Since the growth rate along the [0001] direction was faster than those along other 
directions, the nuclei sites gradually formed and grew into a structure between nanorod and 
nanotube (Figure 12(c) step 1 to 3). The height of the center rod is higher than that of the edge 
tube. In addition, some of the tube/rod composite nanostructures (I) would become pyramid/rod 
composite nanostructures (II). It is worth to mention that the pyramid/rod nanostructure is not 
hollow by comparing the TEM images of tube/rod and pyramid/rod composite nanostructure. 
From the TEM image of pyramid/rod composite nanostructure, there is no significant color 
difference in the nanorod part. The nanorod in the center and the nanotube at the edge combined 
together as shown in Figure 12(c) from step 3 to 4. The nanorod in the center tended to combine 
with the edge tube so as to reduce the local surface energy [20]. Thus, the formation of ZnO 
pyramid/rod composite nanostructure appeared. In our opinion, the formation of ZnO 
pyramid/rod composite nanostructure can be divided into three stages of growth including (1) 
ZnO nanorod growth, (2) tube/rod composite nanostructure and (3) filling out the gap and in the 
resulting formation of pyramid. 
We also compared the surface morphologies of ZnO nanostructures deposited on the ZnO 
nanorod arrays/sapphire substrates at different growth temperatures at the 3rd step of the growth 
process. Figures 13(a)~(f) show the tilt and cross-sectional SEM images of the ZnO 
nanostructures deposited at different temperature of 300, 450, and 550oC. It is clear that the 
surface morphology of ZnO nanostructures changed dramatically under various growth 
temperatures. In Figures 13(a) and (d), the ZnO nanostructure grown at relatively low 
temperature has lower thickness and is prone to perform 2D growth under lower growth 
temperature rather than higher growth temperature [21]. In Figures 13(c) and (f), the ZnO 
nanostructure is still rod structure at 550oC. In MOCVD process, the growth behavior depends on 
the type of precursors, growth temperature, chamber pressure and other growth parameters. 
Nevertheless, the growth temperature is considered to affect the structure mostly than any other 
growth parameters during growth. Therefore, the growth temperature is a key factor in affecting 
the structure of ZnO nanotube arrays.

arrays/sapphire substrates at different growth temperatures: (a);(d) 350oC, (b);(e) 450oC 
and (c);(f) 550oC during the 3rd step of the growth process. 
 
In addition, the optical properties of ZnO nanorod arrays and ZnO nanotube arrays were 
investigated by room temperature PL spectroscopy. In Figure 14, the PL spectrum of ZnO 
nanorod arrays presents an ultraviolet band emission at around 384 nm with a full width at half 
maximum (FWHM) value of 110 meV, which can be attributed to the NBE emission. The NBE 
emission of ZnO generally interprets as originating from excitonic recombinations [22]. 
Meanwhile, the green band emission around 500-600 nm is hardly observed in the sample, 
indicating a good optical quality of the ZnO nanorod arrays. According to the previous reports, it 
was said that the green band emission was attributed to the DLE caused by the impurities and 
structural defects in the crystal such as oxygen vacancies, zinc interstitials and so on [23]. A 
similar result was obtained from the ZnO nanotube arrays grown on ZnO nanorod arrays. Since 
no noticeable DLE peak was observed from the nanotube structure, there is nearly no presence of 
defects in the structure. Therefore, the ZnO nanotube arrays grown by MOCVD have great 
optical quality. In addition, it is well known that one way to evaluate the optical quality of ZnO is 
to compare the relative PL intensity ratio of the NBE to the DLE [24]. At room temperature, the 
NBE-to-DLE intensity ratio was 820:1 and 2050:1 for ZnO nanorod and nanotube arrays, 
respectively. Comparing the outcome obtained from the PL spectra, ZnO nanotube arrays have 
better optical property than that of ZnO nanorod arrays. This is because the tubular structures

substrate normal direction. The same tendency can be found in the result of ZnO nanotube arrays 
as shown in the inset of Figure 15(b) and the rocking curve on the (0002) peak shows a FWHM 
of ~1625 arc second. The lower crystal quality of ZnO nanotubes observed by the XRD rocking 
curve is due to the variation of growth temperature from 650 to 450oC.

Inset figures in (a) and (b) show the XRD rocking curve profiles at the (0002) 
reflection. 
 
Furthermore, the in-plane ψ-scan for the (1012) plane of ZnO nanorod arrays, ZnO 
nanotube arrays and sapphire substrate are presented in Figures 16(a), (b), and (c), respectively. A 
six-fold symmetry in ψ-scan for the (1012) plane of ZnO nanorod arrays was also performed and 
the results are displayed in Figure 16(a). It is clear that the well-defined peaks show a six-fold 
 - 22 -
growth time of 10 min. As we can see from the inset of Figure 17(a), the growth of ZnO nanotube 
in the early stage starts from the edges of the structure. Figure 17(b) indicates the growth sites 1, 
2, and 3 on each growth surface of ZnO nanorod. Atoms can adsorb on different sites of the 
surface including the planar (site 3) and the edges (sites 1 and 2). Nevertheless, higher binding 
energies at the edges will cause selective growth at sites 1 and 2 [29]. The growth of ZnO would 
perform at edges of the ZnO nanorod and therefore resulted in the formation of ZnO nanotube 
structure. Additionally, the crystal exhibits different growth behaviors depending on the relative 
growth rates of various crystal facets. In the c-oriented epitaxial ZnO structure, the {1011} and 
{1010} faces locate at the lateral side as shown in Figure 17(c). It is known that the growth rate 
of the {0001} faces is faster than the growth rate of the {1011} and {1010} faces [30,31]. 
Moreover, according to ideal ZnO crystal growth, the growth rate along [0001] direction is about 
twice larger than the growth rate along the [1010] direction. Therefore, nucleations on the edges 
and preferring growth along the c-axis lead to the generation of ZnO nanotube structures. The 
hollow core of nanotube arrays is considered as the most promising morphology for the 
applications of gas sensors and photocatalysis due to its high porosity and large specific surface 
area. EDS measurements were carried out as shown in Figure 17(d). The SEM-EDS results of 
ZnO buffer and nanotube arrays reveal that the buffer and tubes are composed of Zn and O. It 
represents that the formation of ZnO buffer and nanotube arrays do not include any metal 
catalysts or additives. Therefore, the formation mechanism of ZnO nanotube arrays is different 
from the previous reports which use metal as catalysts. It is said that the growth of ZnO nanotube 
arrays may follow a self-catalyzed growth mechanism.

The typical growth conditions were as follows: DEZn bubbler was 
immersed at 17oC, a reactor chamber pressure was 20 Torr, rotation of 
disk was 1000 rpm, and a total carrier gas flow was 3000 sccm. 
 
Effects of VI/II (O2/DEZn) ratio on the surface morphology and crystal quality of ZnO on 
the sapphire substrates have been investigated. The VI/II ratio was varied by changing the DEZn 
flow rates from 10 to 40 sccm while the O2 flow rate was fixed at 600 sccm. The SEM images of 
ZnO grown at different DEZn flow rates are shown in Figure 18. In Figures 18(a) and (b), the 
morphologies of ZnO are columnar grain while the average grain size increases with increasing 
DEZn flow rate. In Figures 18(c) and (d), ZnO structures become nanowall-network structures 
with increasing DEZn flow rate above 30 sccm. The same tendency was found in the size of 
nanowall network structures. The size of the nanowall-network structures increases with 
increasing DEZn flow rates from 30 to 40 sccm. To better understand the growth mechanism, 
ZnO nanowall networks on the sapphire substrate were prepared at different time intervals of 25, 
30 and 35 min for further investigation. Figure 19 shows a series of SEM images for clarifying 
the growth mechanism of ZnO nanowall network. As shown in Figure 19(a), continuous grains 
are observed at the initial stage. With increasing growth time, the surface starts to become rough 
and the rough grains (white grain) start to connect with each other by bridges [Figure 19(b)]. 
Finally, vertical ZnO nanowall networks are formed directly on sapphire substrate [Figure 19(c)]. 
Figure 19(d) shows the schematic illustration of the ZnO nanowall networks growth mechanism. 
Owing to the lattice mismatch between ZnO and sapphire substrate, ZnO do not obey a 
two-dimensional layer-by-layer growth mode. Under high DEZn flow rate, the 3D growth mode 
causes increasing surface roughness. The tip on the ZnO surface could work as an activation site 
for the formation of the ZnO nanowall networks because of the different surface energy. The ZnO 
structure tends to form at the tips of the ZnO surface to reduce the local surface energy [32,33].

growth temperature of 550°C, and a DEZn flow rate of 30 sccm.). To better understand the 
growth mechanism of the ZnO nanowall networks on the GaN/sapphire substrate, the FE-SEM 
images of the ZnO nanowall networks grown at different time intervals are shown in Figures 
20(a)-(d). To determine why the ZnO structures have a nanowall-network-shaped morphology, it 
is necessary to understand the thermodynamic stability of the ZnO structure. Generally, crystals 
exhibit different growth rates for various crystal facets [34]. There are some small islands formed 
on the GaN surface and the islands tend to combine with each other, as shown in Figure 20(a). 
With increasing growth time, ZnO growth is easily oriented in the [0001] direction, which is also 
the preferred growth direction of ZnO. Finally, the insufficient two-dimensional (2D) growth 
mode will lead to the generation of ZnO nanowall-network structures. VLS is the most common 
mechanism that explains the growth process of nanostructures. In this VLS mechanism, a metal 
catalyst is considered to play an important role in the formation of ZnO nanostructures.

that the thin film is composed of Zn and O. A cross-sectional FE-SEM image of ZnO nanowall 
networks directly grown at 550oC on the GaN/sapphire substrate without using any metal

significantly with increasing growth temperature. As shown in the figure, the morphologies of 
ZnO are grains, nanorods, nanowalls and nanowires structure at 350, 450, 550, and 650oC, 
respectively. The schematic illustrations of ZnO structures are displayed in the Figure 21(b), 
which shows the dramatic variation of ZnO structures under various growth temperatures. In 
MOCVD process, the growth behavior depends on the type of precursors, growth temperature, 
pressure and other growth parameters. Nevertheless, the growth temperature is said to affect the 
film properties more significantly than any other growth parameters in film growth process. As 
we can see from the SEM images, the morphologies of ZnO changes dramatically under different 
growth temperature and ZnO has a tendency towards nanostructure under high growth 
temperature [35]. 
 
Figure 21 (a) Top-view SEM images and (b) schematic illustration of ZnO structures 
deposited on sapphire substrate at various growth temperatures from 350 to 650oC. 
 
As shown in Figure 22(a), the X-ray θ-2θ scan of ZnO grown under various temperatures in 
the range of 350~650°C are studied. It is found that all samples exhibit the ZnO (002) diffraction. 
ZnO performs strong (002) preferred orientation because of preferred stacking along the (001) 
planes with the lowest surface free energy on the substrate surface [36]. At 350°C, the peak of 
XRD intensity nearly disappears. This result represents that the crystallinity of the ZnO grown 
below 350°C has poor crystal structure because the thermal energy is not enough for the 
decomposition of zinc precursor. It is known that the DEZn begins to decompose at 357oC and 
completely decompose at 400oC [37,38]. Moreover, at low temperature, the surface atoms would 
not have enough energy to move to the lowest energy site and therefore limit the formation of 
well-crystallized ZnO. For the sample grown in the temperature range of 350~550°C, the 
crystallinity of the ZnO becomes better due to the increasing thermal energy greater than the

by using MOCVD. (b) Schematic illustration of the ZnO surface atoms restructure

The surface atoms will restructure and change the atomic position to a more stable state. The 
roughness will become more flat during the annealing process. For better ZnO growth, the 
microstructure of the ZnO grown at various growth times was investigated. Figure 24 shows the 
AFM images and the corresponding schematic illustrations of ZnO morphologies under various 
growth time intervals and after 20 times of RGA cycles. The surface morphology of ZnO 
structures under various growth times from 4 to 12 min was measured by AFM as presented in 
Figures 24(a)-(c). The sparse island was obtained with the growth time of 4 min. At the growth 
time of 8 min, the ZnO structure shows a three-dimensional (3D) island growth with a denser

that the surface roughness achieved an equilibrium state over an annealing time of 20 min. Low 
surface roughness reveals a more complete coalescence and recrystallization process achieved by 
sufficient thermal energy. Therefore, we proposed the RGA growth mode at a growth 
temperature of 450°C for 8 min, an annealing temperature of 650°C for 20 min and repeatedly 
switched between growing and annealing for 20 times.

Finally, ZnO film has been grown by using RGA growth mode under various annealing 
ambient. Figure 26(a)~(f) show the SEM and AFM images of ZnO structures after 20 cycles RGA 
growth mode under Ar, N2, and O2 annealing ambient. When various gases were introduced into 
the reaction chamber, the morphology of the ZnO structures changed. In particular, the RMS 
 - 34 -
was found that the intensity of NBE emission at about 380 nm increased while the intensity of 
DLE between 440 and 600 nm decreased under all kinds of annealing ambient. The NBE 
emission is due to the recombination of free excition emission and the DLE is ascribed to the 
impurities and structural defects in the crystal such as oxygen vacancies, zinc interstitials and so 
on [43,44]. The existence of DLE could result in decreasing carrier/excition lifetime and reducing 
emission efficiency in the UV light devices. By using the RGA growth mode, the DLE in all 
samples are lower than that of the as-grown ZnO as shown in Figure 27. In Figure 27(d), under 
O2 ambient, the RGA growth mode can enhance the NBE emission and quench the DLE. During 
the O2 annealing process, oxygen could diffuse into the lattice to fill the oxygen vacancies or 
react with zinc interstitial under high annealing temperatures. However, the intensity of DLE 
decreased as well under Ar and N2 annealing ambient as shown in Figures 27(b) and (c). 
Therefore, the zinc interstitial should be the major defect in the ZnO because high annealing 
temperatures could reduce the defect of zinc interstitial but not the defect of oxygen vacancy [45]. 
Zhang et al. also reported that the blue luminescence in the range of 428~478 nm (2.9~2.6 eV) 
was mainly due to the zinc defects [46]. Among all the samples, ZnO structure annealed under O2 
ambient presents the highest PL peak intensity due to the largest thickness and nanostructure 
morphology.

various thickness of AZO. (b) Total flux of TCL/GaN-based LED as a function of AZO 
thickness from 0 to 20 μm. 
 
As can be noted in Figure 29(b), the plot of total flux versus AZO thickness can be divided into 
two regions. These regions are marked by (I) and (II). In region (I), GaN-based LEDs without 
AZO have better light extraction efficiency than those with AZO. The critical angle (θc) at the 
GaN-air interface determined by Snell’s law is approximately 23o (θc= sin-1(nair/nGaN)), which 
`limits the the light extraction efficiency to ~8.4% calculated by 1–cosθc [47,48]. After the 
deposition of AZO on GaN, the θc could increase to 31o for the light emission from the AZO to 
air. Nevertheless, the θc is 49o for the light emission from the GaN active layer to AZO. 
Therefore, the critical angle is also limited within 23o while the light emitting from the GaN via 
the AZO to air. The simulating light extraction efficiency of 0.375 and 1 μm AZO/GaN-based 
LEDs are lower than that of original LED due to the light confinement between GaN and AZO. 
With increasing AZO thickness from 0.375 to 20 μm, the total flux of AZO/GaN-based LED

Particularly, in Figure 31(e), ZnO structure becomes vertically-aligned columnar grain structure

AZO structure as shown in Figure 31(f). The light transmitted in the AZO structure can escape to

GaN-based LED with AZO electrode was almost the same as that with ITO electrode. Figure 
32(a) shows the output power-current characteristics of TCL/GaN-based LEDs with different 
contacts. As the injection current of 20 mA, the optical output powers were 1.56 and 1.70 mW 
with 375 and 1200 nm AZO, respectively. The difference in optical output power becomes larger 
under higher injection current. There are mainly due to the high surface texturing of 1200 nm 
AZO. Moreover, it is clear that the LED with 1200 nm AZO can reach a uniform current 
spreading at a low current intensity of 0.02 mA as shown in the inset of Figure 32(b).

Wet etching the sacrificial layer and lift-off process can be used to fabricate freestanding 
GaN LED on copper substrate. The copper substrate is selected for its good electrical and high 
thermal conductivity. Figure 35 shows the structure of the sapphire substrate/ZnO sacrificial 
layer/GaN epitaxial layer/Cu substrate, which are fabricated by wet etching the sacrificial layer 
and patterned electroplating process. This method comprises following process steps: depositing

Figure 37 OM images show the lateral etching effect of the ZnO layer in different 
etchants of (a) H3PO4, (b) HCl, and (c) HF for 4 min. After HF dipping, the observation 
of peeling off phenomenon is shown in (d). 
 
As shown in Figure 38(a), the lateral etch depth of the ZnO sacrificial layer as a function of 
etch time has been investigated. Figure 38(b) show the OM images of 1×1 mm2 
PR/ZnO/Sapphire structure after 10, 20, and 30 min etching in HCl solution. The results show 
that the lateral etch depth of the ZnO sacrificial layer increases rapidly in the beginning. With 
increasing etch time, there will be only a small increase because the diffusion of the etchant will 
limit the etching speed after long etch time. Therefore, a long etch time is necessary for large area 
separation process, which reduces the yield and causes the production problem. Regarding to this

could react with HCl during the lift-off process. On the other hand, after HF etching, the EDS 
result indicates that the black square is composed of Ga and N (data not shown), which 
corresponds to the result obtained from HCl etchant.

thermal or mechanical damage during separation [54]. However, the higher vale of the FWHM 
may originate from the transferring of the GaN buffer layer. Moreover, good uniformity is 
obtained over GaN on both two-inch sapphire and patterned copper substrate. The result also 
indicates that a nearly complete separation of the GaN epitaxial layer from sapphire substrate is 
obtained. MOCVD growth of GaN is typically done at growth temperatures over 900°C. 
Meanwhile, H2 and NH3 are employed as a carrier gas and as source of atomic nitrogen, 
respectively. High quality GaN could be obtained on ZnO by adjusting the growth parameters or 
process because ZnO and GaN have the same wurtzite structure and only a small lattice mismatch 
and difference in thermal expansion coefficient [55]. Nevertheless, ZnO is unstable at elevated 
growth temperature in H2 and NH3 ambient. Therefore, the next and important challenge will be 
the growth of high quality GaN on ZnO and the fabrication of 2” GaN/Cu LED by wet etching 
the ZnO sacrificial layer. 
 
 
4. Conclusions 
In this dissertation, several kinds of ZnO nanostructures including nanorods, nanotubes, and 
nanowalls have been demonstrated. Moreover, AZO transparent conducting layers and ZnO 
sacrificial layer have practical application. The important findings are described below: 
1. The density of vertically aligned ZnO nanorod arrays was found to govern by the 
morphology and thickness of buffer layer. That is to say, the ZnO buffer layer can be used as 
the nucleation template to control the growth direction and density of the ZnO nanorod 
arrays. In addition, by controlling the diethyl zinc flow rate, we can manipulate the size, 
crystal, and optical quality of ZnO nanorod arrays. Finally, the growth process of ZnO 
nanoarray arrays follows the self-catalyzed growth mechanism.  
2. Vertically well-aligned ZnO nanotube arrays were synthesized using a three-step growth 
process by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition. When the growth temperature was 
switched from 650 to 450oC during the growth process, almost all of the ZnO structure 
changed from ZnO nanorod into ZnO nanotube arrays. The SEM, XRD, and TEM results all 
confirm that the ZnO nanotube arrays have single crystal wurtzite structure and strong 
orientation in the [0001] direction. PL result presents high optical quality and nearly
