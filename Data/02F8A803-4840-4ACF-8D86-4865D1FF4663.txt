(RFID) applications. The four-element array is based 
on PIFA 
grounded by vias, which can enhance the directive 
gain. The 
array antenna is fed by a four-port microstrip-line 
power divider. 
The input impedance of the power divider is designed 
to match 
with that of a Monza&regÔºõ 4 microchip. The 
parametric analysis of 
conjugate matching was performed and prototypes were 
fabricated to verify the simulated results. 
Experimental tests 
show that the maximum reading range achieved by an 
RFID tag 
equipped with the array antenna achieves about 3.9 m 
when the 
tag was mounted on a human body.

antenna, (b) a planar dipole with a T-match structure, (c) a nested suspended 
slot patch antenna, and (d) a PIFA-type tag antenna. 
Fig. 1(a) shows a folded planar dipole in the free space. 
Fig. 1(b) is a folded-dipole tag antenna with a T-matching 
structure. The strip width of the T-matching that is near the 
dipole is small but the width of the dipole is wide [7]. The 
research pointed out it can overcome electric modification 
due to effective wavelength change when the tag is mounted 
on a material object [8]. Fig. 1(c) shows a nested slot 
suspended patch antenna (NSSP) in the free space. The 
NSSP has impedance tuning capability and possibility to host 
electronics packaging. Marrocco et al. has evaluated the 
performance sensitivity to human size and demonstrated the 
NSSP can match to complex loads of different microchip [2]. 
Fig. 1(d) is a planar inverted-F antenna which has its own 
ground plane. PIFA has a ground plane so that it can reduce 
tolerances to the environment. As for the folded dipole or the 
T-matching type dipole antenna which does not have a 
ground plane, the radiation characteristics and the input 
impedances of the antennas will be distorted when the tag is 
placed on the chest of a human body. A microchip, 
manufactured by Impinj Company, is used for tag designs. 
The input impedance of the microchip is 59-j242 Œ© which 
must be conjugate matched to that of a tag antenna [9]. 
Fig. 2(a) shows the simulated results of the folded dipole 
shown in Fig. 1(a). The simulation results are obtained by the 
FEKO simulation tool [10]. Fig.2 (a) shows the return loss 
and power transmission coefficient, and (b) shows the input 
impedance ZA=RA+jXA. Also shown in the figures are 
measured data of a practically constructed antenna. The input 
impedance in this presentation is measured via a test fixture, 
called ‚Äújig‚Äù, by using a two-port network analyzer E5071B. 
Qing et al. proposed a methodology to characterize the input 
impedance of a balance/unbalance tag antenna [11]. Together 
with the coaxial test fixture and the port extension technique 
in a VNA, the impedance of the balance antenna can be 
extracted directly from the measured S-parameters over 
broadband. The simulation results by the FEKO software is 
shown in good agreement with those by measurement.

are shown on Fig. 6.

the four kinds of tag antennas shown in Fig. 1. The variations 
of the transmission coefficient due to the body-effects at 925 
MHz are 17.3 dB, 21.7 dB,   4.04 dB , and 0.54 dB, 
respectively. The study finds that the PIFA has less influence 
caused by the human-body.

Figure 8. Degradation of the realized peak gain due to the body effects. 
The designed tag antenna is always matched to the 
impedance of the terminating microchip. The mismatch loss 
between the tag antenna and the terminating microchip due 
to body-effects has been quantified by the power 
transmission coefficient mentioned above. The realized gain 
can be calculated by multiplying the power transmission 
coefficient and the gain defined by IEEE standard. FEKO 
uses the IEEE standard 145-1983 (page 6) for the gain 
computation. The definition of the computed gain obtained 
by the FEM/MoM approach of FEKO does not include the 
mismatch loss. The realized gain shown below is a power 
gain which includes mismatch loss in the source impedance. 
Fig. 8 shows the degradation of the realized peak gain due to 
body effects. The degradations at 925 MHz are 12.1 dB, 15.8 
dB, 4.55 dB, and 1.37 dB respectively. Finding shows that 
the absorption caused by a human body for NSSP is less than 
the planar dipoles. The bandwidth of the PIFA is small and it 
is not uni-planar although its gain variation is the least. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, a folded planar dipole, a planar dipole with 
a T-match structure, a NSSP antenna, and a PIFA are 
designed for a card-type RFID tag. The measurement for the 
input impedances was performed to verify the simulation 
results using the FEKO software. The tag antennas attached 
onto a simplified human tissue are investigated. The 
influences of the human body on the power transmission 
coefficient and realized power gain have been evaluated. The 
study finds that the NSSP antenna and PIFA are the better 
candidates for the RFID tag placed on the chest. Since the 
NSSP antenna is a uniplanar structure, it is easy to paste on a 
student card for University-campus identification application.

is designed to feed the RF source into the four PIFA elements. 
A tag microchip, Monza¬Æ 4 from the Impinj Company, is 
placed between two strips of the power divider.
The original two-element PIFA structure, which has a 
high-impedance electromagnetic surface (HIS)
interference from the metallic object surface on which the tag 
is mounted. The basic concept of HIS and PIFA
RFID tag antenna proposed by Chen and Lin can be found in 
[7]. In [8], a two-element PIFA tag antenna was presented and 
the predicted reading range is only 1.65 m
pasted on a metallic object. Thus, it is necessary to design a 
high-gain antenna to cope with the influence of 
body. The mutli-port array tag antenna can enha
as to compensate for the degradation due to the interference 
from body objects. However, the feeding scheme using the 
power divider is not easy to design. The antenna is targeted at 
operation in the 922~928 MHz UHF band. The input 
impedance of the antenna system must be conjugately matched 
with the impedance of the RF microchip in order to optimize 
the tag performance [9]. The input impedance of the Monza
microchip is Zc=11-j143 at 915 MHz [10]. Hence, the input 
impedance of the power divider should be Za=11+
MHz. 
The four-element PIFA array is shown in Fig. 1. The 
dimensional parameters of the final design are as follows: 
L=85.5 mm, W=54 mm, H=1.6 mm, La=24.5
mm, Ls=13.3 mm, Ws=8 mm, d=2 mm, and 
radius of the vias is 1 mm. The study finds that the distance 
between the grounded vias of the PIFAs on the left and right 
sides has significant influence on the input impedance. 
Changing the interval Ls significantly affects the impedance 
matching. Controlling the interval Ls allows us to adjust the 
input impedance so as to obtain optimal impedanc
and radiation gain [7].  Parametric study on the antenna 
behavior as a function of Ls was performed using the EM 
simulator. Fig. 2 shows the effects of varying Ls on the return 
loss. The results show that the optimal distance Ls is about 1
mm.

IV. CONCLUTION 
This paper presented a four-element array antenna 
mountable close to a human body for UHF band RFID 
applications. The array antenna based on the PIFAs with 
grounded vias enhances the directive gain even when the tag is 
pasted on a human body. The array antenna is fed by a 
four-port microstrip-line power divider. The input impedance 
of the power divider was designed to conjugately match with 
the impedance of the Monza¬Æ 4 microchip. Parametric analysis 
was performed using EMSS‚Äôs FEKO and the structures were 
fabricated for test. Experimental results show that the 
maximum reading range achieved by an RFID tag equipped 
with the array antenna is about 3.9 m when the tag was pasted 
on the chest of a human body.
