一、前言及研究目的 
本研究的目的在以行動感測網路偵測目標物的出現與否，我們所設計的行動感測方法
如圖 1所示，在感測區域內同時有一個或多個固定式感測器與行動感測器，行動感測器由
一基地出發，遶行一預設路徑，在遶行途中行動感測器有兩項任務，第一是在設定的地點
收集目標物信號的能量，並將收集的數據帶回基地決定最後的偵測結果；第二項任務是由
於感測區域可能非常廣大，固定式的感測器將無法只利用無線網路將偵測得到的目標物信
號能量傳回基地，因此行動感測器也將負責經過每個固定式感測器的傳輸範圍，接收固定
式感測器的偵測資料，一併帶回至基地參與偵測結果的決定。在這樣的偵測架構下，固定
式感測器與行動感測器可以互相合作收集資料，以彌補雙方在偵測上的死角，提高偵測效
率。而由於行動感測器需遶行感測區域，行動感測器的路徑長度將影響其電力消耗，如何
計畫行動感測器的遶行路線與偵測地點，使得最後的偵測機率提高，並縮短行動感測器的
遶行路徑是本計畫的研究重點，在此報告中，我們將提出我們的路徑規劃方法，並展示我
們的模擬結果。

其中|u-si|是目標物到感測器的距離，β為衰減係數，而 αi(u)為因障礙物所造成的信號衰減

障礙物的模型如圖 2 所示，假設障礙物為一個圓形，我們將其分成內圓周與外圓周，
我們可以畫出由目標物到內外圓周的切線，若感測器的位置在外圓周切線以外的區域，則
感測器的偵測值不會受到障礙物的影響，αi(u)的值為 1；若感測器的位置在內圓周切線之內，
則感測器完全偵測不到目標物的信號，αi(u)的值為 0；若感測器的位置在內外圓周切線之間，
則 αi(u)的值依感測器與目標物連線句障礙物的距離，等比例由 0 增加到 1。由此我們可得

Abstract—Detecting the presence/absence of an object in a
region of interest is one of the important applications for sensor
networks. A considerable amount of work has been seen in the
literature for detecting events or objects using wireless sensor
networks. Most of the prior work uses a simple binary detection
model or an average signal strength model to make decisions of
detection. Such methods are not optimal in terms of detection
probability. This paper derives a detection approach which is
optimal in the sense of Neyman-Pearson test and shows that the
detection performance of the traditional average based method is
much lower than the optimal. To reduce power consumption and
communication cost, a localized fusion method is also developed
by carefully selecting sensors in the vicinity of a target location.
The paper shows that the localized fusion can dramatically reduce
the number of sensors participating the fusion while maintain
high detection performance.
I. INTRODUCTION
Advanced sensor network technologies have been envi-
sioned to improve our capability to observe the physical
environment. A potential application of sensor networks is
to detect the presence/absence of a target in a region of
interest. This paper addresses the target detection problem
and proposes an optimal detector based on Neyman-Pearson
test. A localized fusion approach is also developed to reduce
unnecessary message transmissions.
Considerable efforts have been made in the literature for
target detection and coverage problems in wireless sensor
networks[1], [2]. One typical sensing model is based on a
trivial binary detection assumption where the coverage area
of a sensor is modeled as a circle and a target is detected if it
is in any sensor’s coverage area [2]. In this model, since the
detection decision is made by a particular sensor and sensory
data are inherently corrupted by noise, the probability of false
alarms could be very high. Another conventional method for
target detection is based on the average of target signal strength
measured by all sensors. The average is used as an indicator for
the presence/absence of the target[1], [3]. However, collecting
measurements from all sensors may involve long distance
communications and consume the precious power of sensor

nodes. In addition, these heuristics can not achieve the optimal
detection performance in terms of detection probability.
The paper derives an optimal collaborative detection ap-
proach based on the Neyman-Pearson test which maximizes
the detection probability subject to a fixed false alarm prob-
ability. A geometrical interpretation as well as efficient nu-
merical solution for computing the detection probability and
false alarm probability is presented. The paper also derives the
traditional average based detector and compares its detection
performance to the optimal detector. The paper shows that the
detection performance of the average based detector is much
lower than the optimal.
A localized fusion method is also developed to reduce
power consumption by avoiding unnecessary communications.
In general, measurements taken by sensors far away from a
target do not have significant impact on the final decisions and
can be ignored in the fusion. The significance, or the weight,
of a particular sensor’s measurements is derived from the
Neyman-Pearson test and is shown to be a function of distance
from the target to the sensor. The paper shows that, with
carefully selected threshold for the weights, an appropriate
set of sensors can be chosen for monitoring a specific target
location while maintain high detection performance.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces
the sensing model. Section III proposes the optimal detection
method and compares the detection performance to con-
ventional methods. Section IV presents the localized fusion
method. The paper is concluded in Section V.
II. SENSING MODEL
Consider n sensors randomly deployed in a region at loca-
tions {ρ1, ρ2, ···, ρn}. The sensors collaborate to detect a target
in a geographical region. A target can be a wild fire occurring
in a forest, an enemy vehicle spying the activities of troops,
and/or a radiological dispersion device (RDD), which emits
non-fissile but highly radioactive particles in the monitored
region. Assume that a certain signal emitted by the target can
be detected by the sensors. According to the general radio
propagation model [4], the signal power of a target at location

SIMULATION PARAMETERS
Region size 20 × 20 Target signal power S 10
Gain gi 1 Energy decay factor β 2
Noise N(0, 1) False alarm probability 0.05
C. Determining the test threshold λ
Let Zr be the region of sensor measurements corresponding
to hypothesis Hr. Given a Target at location r, the detection
probability is defined as
PD =
∫
Zr
P (x |Hr )dx, (4)
i.e., the integration of P (x|Hr) over the region of sTx > h. In
other words, the detection probability is the probability that the
fusion center makes a true positive conclusion. Analogously,
given no target in the region, the false alarm probability is
defined as
PF =
∫
Zr
P (x |H0 )dx. (5)
Similarly, it is the probability that the fusion center makes a
false positive conclusion.
To calculate the detection probability and false alarm prob-
ability, it is required to calculate the corresponding cumulative
multi-variate normal probability bounded by a hyperplane. To
the best of our knowledge, there is no analytic solution for
computing the cumulative multi-variate normal probability.
Fortunately, a numerical method for computing such cumula-
tive probability over convex regions is proposed in [5]. Thus,
eq. (4) and (5) can be evaluated numerically if the hyperplane
is defined, i.e., the value of the test threshold λ is given.
In contrast, for the detection rule in eq. (3), we are going
to determine the λ for a predefined false alarm probability.
λ can be determined by finding a hyperplane which renders
the integral of eq. (5) matching the predefined false alarm
probability. Essentially, this is to find the h value for the
hyperplane equation sTx = h, and the corresponding λ can
be calculated from the h. An algorithm for finding the λ for
a given false alarm probability is shown in Algorithm 1. The
algorithm approaches the targeted λ using a binary search.
D. Detection probability profile
A simulation is conducted to demonstrate the evaluation
of detection probability in a 20 × 20 region with 20 sensors
randomly deployed in the region. Table I lists the simulation
parameters. The region is divided into a grid and the target
is assumed to be able to appear on any grid point. For each
target location r, the hyperplane corresponding to the false
alarm probability 0.05 is first searched using Algorithm 1 with
the termination threshold Δfa set to 0.0001. Subsequently,
the detection probability given a target at r is evaluated
with the corresponding hyperplane. Fig. 2 shows the detec-
tion probability profile over all the grid points. Note that
the sensors are actually deployed on the ground. Obviously,

detection probability on a grid point is highly correspondent
to the distance from nearby sensors. The detection probability
profile provides a visual indication for the vulnerability of the
deployment. An intelligent target may hide at the lowest valley
in the profile in order to avoid the detection. It also provides
an easy way to judge the quality of the deployment.
E. Average based detection
A traditional heuristic fusion method for target detection
is based on the average of signal power collected from all
sensors, e.g., the value fusion method proposed in [3]. The
presence of the target is determined when the average is higher
than a predefined threshold. The rationale behind this method
is that if the target is present, the total signal power measured
by the sensors is likely to be high. Otherwise, it is more likely
to be low. Although this is a simple and reasonable inference,
the detection performance in terms of detection probability is
not so admirable.
Using value fusion, if a target is present at location r, the

overlapped. In other words, one sensor may be responsible for
covering several target locations.
B. Evaluations
We show the localized fusion on the same sensor deploy-
ment as previous experiments. All the simulation parameters
are the same as in Table I. Again, two target locations – (10,
10) and (5, 11) – are selected for the cases of a target far away
and close to some sensors in its vicinity, respectively.
1) Impact on detection performance: We first investigate
the impact on detection probability with different number
of sensors participating the fusion. Sensors are sorted in
descending order according to their weights for the given
target location. Then, the sensors are added one by one to
the fusion process. Fig. 4(a) shows the network with sensors
labeled by the order of their weights associated with target
location (10, 10). The detection probability versus the number
of sensors participating the fusion is shown in Fig. 4(b). The
detection probability is pretty low because the hypothetical
target location is far away from sensors in the vicinity. As
expected, the more sensors participating the fusion, the higher
the detection probability. Since the sensors are ordered, the
detection probability increases more quickly when the first
few sensors are added and the slope of the change becomes
moderate when the other sensors join the fusion.
Fig. 5 shows the results when the target is in (5, 11), where
the target is very close to three nearby sensors. We can see
in Fig. 5(b), the detection probability increases dramatically
when the first three sensors are added to the fusion. Since all
the other sensors are far away from the target, adding the other
sensors does not improve the detection probability much.
2) ROC curves: The ROC curves for both the two target
locations are shown in Fig. 6. The sensor selection threshold is
defined as ψ×zmax, where zmax is the highest sensor weight
and 0 < ψ < 1 . For target location (10, 10), there are 9 and
6 sensors participating the fusion for ψ = 0.3 and ψ = 0.6,
respectively. In Fig. 6(a), the drop of detection probability
when ψ = 0.3 is moderate as compared to ψ = 0.6 since
more sensors participate the fusion. For example, when the
false alarm probability is 0.05, the detection probability for the
cases of all 20 sensors, 9 sensors, and 6 sensors participating
the fusion are 0.2588, 0.2147, and 0.0768, respectively. A

reasonable choice could be using 9 sensors to cover the
location (10, 10), which will reduce the communication cost
with a factor of 2.
Similar condition also occurs when choosing the number of
nodes to protect location (5, 11) as shown in Fig. 6(b). In this
case, 3 sensors could be enough for this target location which
reduce the communication cost even more.
V. CONCLUSIONS
This paper addresses the target detection problem in wire-
less sensor networks. It shows that the detection performance
of the traditional average based detector can be much lower
than the optimal. It also develops a localized fusion method to
reduce power consumption without significantly deteriorating
the detection performance. However, checking for each po-
tential target location may induce unnecessary overhead. It is
worth to further investigate the problem of finding the covering
area, instead of a location, for a set of sensors.
