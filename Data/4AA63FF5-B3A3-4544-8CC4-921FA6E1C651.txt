摘要 
本實驗製程採用 Glycine-nitrate Process (GNP)製程合成 La0.6Sr0.4Co1-xMxO3 (M= Fe、
Mn、Cu、Zn, x=0.2~0.8)等陰極奈米粉末，分別表示為 LSCF、LSCM、LSCCu及 LSCZ。
在 LSCF、LSCM及 LSCCu系列中，當 x=0.2時，其主相為 Rhombohedral 結構之 LaCoO3，
且伴隨微量第二相 SrLaCoO4生成。並隨著 x 值的增加，其主相分別轉變成 Cubic 結構的
LaFeO3 、 Orthorhombic 結構的 LaMnO3 及 Monoclinic 結 構 的 La2Cu2O5 。 其 中
La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Mn0.2O3具有單相 LaMnO3結構。此三系列經更高溫的熱處理後，皆可得到立
方結構的 LaCoO3。在 LSCZ系列較其他三系列具有不同現象，因 Zn離子半徑較大，無法
順利取代晶格中的 Co離子，導致產物中均有 ZnO第二相生成。 
在粉末表面型態分析分面，發現利用 Glycine-nitrate Process所製備之粉末其粒徑大小

Abstract 
In this study, the nanometer cathode powders of La0.6Sr0.4Co1-xMxO3 (M= Fe、Mn、Cu、Zn, 
x=0.2~0.8) oxides were prepared by Glycine-nitrate Process (GNP). When x=0.2 at LSCF-base, 
LSCM-base and LSCCu-base, the main phase is LaCoO3 of Rhombohedral structure, and the 
second phase is SrLaCoO4 . With increase of x value, the main phase gradually changes into 
LaFeO3 of Cubic structure, LaMnO3 of Orthorhombic structure and La2Cu2O5 of Monoclinic 
structure, respectively. And La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Mn0.2O3 has single phase of LaMnO3 of Cubic 
structure. And this three base can get LaCoO3 of Cubic structure by thermal treatment with higher 
temperature. The LSCZ-base different from the others. Zn ion can’t complete substitute Co ion in 
lattice because Zn ion radius is bigger than Co ion, therefore, LSCZ-base have ZnO phase. It was 
found that the microstructures of LSCM gain size in the range of 0.2~0.5 µm. 
In conductivity, LSCM-base have two phase conduction mechanism, and the others base 
have not obvious turning point. The highest conductivity for La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3 is 485 S/cm at 
500℃~600℃, La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Mn0.2O3 is 248 S/cm at 400~450℃；La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Cu0.2O3 is 568 
S/cm at 700℃~750℃ and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Zn0.2O3 is 345 S/cm at 550℃~650℃, respectively.

4.1 陰極粉末之晶體結構分析 
4.1.1 La0.6Sr0.4Co1-xFexO3 之粉末

LSCF6428~LSCF6482) 粉末經 1000℃煆燒
12 小 時 之 X-ray 繞 射 圖 譜 。 在
LSCF6482(x=0.2)時可看出主相 LaCoO3 
(Rhombohedral, JCPDS 48-0123)已形成，但
仍有微量第二相 SrLaCoO4 (Tetragonal, 
JCPDS 83-2412)的生成。並隨著 x 值的增
加，其主相慢慢轉變成 LaFeO3 (Cubic, 
JCPDS 75-0439)，而第二相也隨之轉變成
SrLaFeO4 (Tetragonal, JCPDS 71-1745)。 
Fig. 5 為 La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3 
(LSCF6482)粉末經 1000℃~1200℃煆燒 12
小時之 X-ray繞射圖譜。由圖中可發現隨著
溫度的升高，其主相會由 Rhombohedral 結
構的 LaCoO3 (JCPDS 48-0123)轉變成 Cubic
結構的 LaCoO3 (JCPDS 75-0279)，但仍有微
量第二相 SrLaCoO4 (Tetragonal, JCPDS 
83-2412)的生成。故可推論提高熱處理溫度
雖然無法生成單一相的 LaCoO3，但是提高
熱處理溫度可以使晶體結構轉變成較對稱
的立方(Cubic)結構。

燒 12小時之 X-ray繞射圖譜。在 LSCM6482
時可看出主相 LaCoO3 (Rhombohedra)已形
成，但仍有微量第二相 SrLaCoO4 (Tetragonal)
的生成。並隨著 x值的增加，其主相慢慢轉
變 成 LaMnO3 (Orthorhombic, JCPDS

可忽略，導電率可視為電子導性所主導；而
在高溫時電子的傳導能力因晶格的不規則
震動變頻繁而降低，同時晶格中氧的缺陷使
得離子躍遷變的容易，造成材料的離子導性
上升，故在高溫環境下可視為離子導性所主

經高溫燒結後之導電性量測圖，由圖中可發
現LSCF系列之陰極材料其導電率從低溫至
高溫並無明顯的曲線，並在 x=0.2~0.7 時，
導電率隨著 x值的增加而減少，但在 x=0.8
時突然上升，其推測隨著 Fe 含量的增加，
會造成整體導電率下降，但由於在 x=0.8時
其結構轉變成較規則的立方晶體結構，故使
得導電率提高。而在 LSCF6482(x=0.2)時於
500℃~600℃有最高導電率 485 S/cm，並隨
著 Fe含量(x值)的增加導電率逐漸下降，而
最差導電率在 LSCF6437(x=0.7)於 650℃
~750℃有最高導電率 40 S/cm，約為最高導
電率之 12分之 1。

發現 LSCM 系列之陰極材料其導電率可明
顯看出有 2段的傳導機制，在低溫時期導電
率隨著溫度升高而持續升高，達最高點後會
下降並趨於一定值。而導電率最高值在
LSCF6482(x=0.2)時，於 400~450℃有最高導
電率 248 S/cm，並隨著 Mn含量(x值)的增
加導電率逐漸下降，而最差導電率在
LSCF6428(x=0.8)於 750℃有最高導電率 14 
S/cm，約為最高導電率之 17分之 1。 
Fig. 15為 LSCCu粉末高壓成形之樣品

除 x=0.3~0.4 在 550℃後有稍微下降外，整
體導電率是隨著 x 值的增加而減少，但
LSCCu6464 的導電率比 LSCCu6473 來的
大，且在 LSCCu6428 時突然上升，其原因
可能是因為隨著 Cu的摻雜導致晶體晶相改
變 所 造 成 的 。 而 導 電 率 最 高 值 在
LSCCu6482(x=0.2)時於 700℃~750℃有最高
導電率 568 S/cm，並隨著 Cu含量(x值)的增
加導電率逐漸下降，而最差導電率在
LSCF6437(x=0.7)於 750℃有最高導電率 31 
S/cm，約為最高導電率之 29分之 1。

經高溫燒結後之導電性量測圖。由圖中可發
現 LSCZ系列之陰極材料除 x=0.2外，其導
電率仍無明顯的轉折點，隨著溫度的升高而
升高，但在 x值為 0.6以上時其導電率幾乎
沒有。而導電率最高值在 LSCZ6482(x=0.2)
時於 550℃~650℃有最高導電率 345 S/cm，
並隨著 Zn 含量(x 值)的增加導電率逐漸下
降，在 x值為 0.6以上時幾乎沒有導電率。 
5、 結論及成果自評 
在LSCF、LSCM及LSCCu系列其 x=0.2

有微量第二相 SrLaCoO4。並隨著 x 值的增
加，其主相分別轉變成 Cubic 結構的
LaFeO3、Orthorhombic 結構的 LaMnO3 及
Monoclinic 結 構 的 La2Cu2O5 ， 而
La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Mn0.2O3有單相的 LaMnO3；而
此三系列再經更高溫的熱處理後，皆可得到
立方結構的 LaCoO3，而此更高溫的熱處理
可由高溫燒結形成相同效果。在 LSCZ系列
較不同於其他三系列，因 Zn 離子半徑較
大，無法順利取代晶格中的 Co離子，導致
其晶相均有 ZnO 的產生。在粉末表面型態
分析中其粉末之晶粒大小約介於 0.2~0.5μ
m之間，可看出利用 Glycine-nitrate Process
可製備接近奈米級的粉末。 
在導電性部分， LSCM 系列可看出有
2 段的傳導機制，其餘 LSCF、LSCCu 及
LSCZ均無法看出明顯的轉折點，而 LSCF、
LSCM、LSCCu及 LSCZ其最高導電率均在
於 x=0.2 時。La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3於 500℃
~600℃有最高導電率為 485 S/cm；
La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Mn0.2O3於 400~450℃有最高導
電率為 248 S/cm；La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Cu0.2O3 於
700℃~750℃有最高導電率為 568 S/cm；

Abstract 
In this study, a new oxygen-deficient cathode material, Sm0.5Sr0.5Co1-xCuxO3-δ (SSCCu) was 
developed. It is expected to enhance the efficiency of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel 
cells (IT-SOFCs). The structure, conductivity and electrochemical performance of SSCCu were 
examined as a function of copper content. The structure of Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.9Cu0.1O3-δ and 
Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Cu0.2O3-δ samples was a single orthorhombic perovskite phase. Second phase 
SrCoO2.8, however, formed in the Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.7Cu0.3O3-δ and Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.6Cu0.4O3-δ samples. The 
conductivity of the Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.7Cu0.3O3-δ cathode was higher than that of other samples. However, 
the Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Cu0.2O3-δ electrode exhibited the lowest overpotential of 25mV at 400mA/cm2 
and the lowest area special resistance of 0.2 Ω．cm2 at 700°C.

Fukunaga et al. have proposed a reaction model for dense SSC [7]. The result show that 
adsorption–desorption at the surface of the electrode is the rate-determining step that is the same as 
for LSC. The adsorption and desorption rate constants of SSC were approximately one order of 
magnitude larger than the corresponding values of LSC. In addition, SSC is compatible both 
chemically and physically with ceria-based electrolyte. 
In this study, a new oxygen-deficit cathode material Sm0.5Sr0.5Co1-xCuxO3-δ (SSCCu), was 
synthesized by the glycine–nitrate method. Structure, conductivity, interfacial resistance and 
overpotential of the SSCCu cathode were investigated.

the cathode side. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured by potentiostat 
(Solartron 1287) and a frequency analyzer (Solartron 1255B/1255) from 0.1~1MHz with an applied 
ac signal of 10mV. The morphologies of the sintered cathode electrode were observed by field 
emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Jeol 6701F).

temperature dependence of the total electrical conductivity of all SSCCu samples in air is given in 
Fig. 4. It was found that the conductivity of SSC, SSCCu01, SSCCu02 and SSCCu03 samples 
decreased with the temperature increase; this is typical behavior of an electronic conductor that 
depends on temperature. However, the conductivity of the SSCCu04 sample slightly increased with 
temperature increase; this is due to the partial ionic conductivity. The conductivity of SSCCu02 and 
SSCCu03 samples is higher than that of SSC, SSCCu01 and SSCCu04. At 800℃, the highest 
electrical conductivity was SSCCu03, at 126 S/cm. SSCCu04 has such a low conductivity due to 
the large amount of second phase SrCoO2.8 that is formed. The logarithm of electrical conductivity 
versus reciprocal temperature of Sm0.5Sr0.5Co1-xCuxO3-δ (x=0~0.4) is plotted (as ln σT versus 1/T) in 
Fig. 5. The calculated activation energy of SSC, SSCCu01, SSCCu02, SSCCu03 and SSCCu04 
sample is 4.3, 4.9, 4.9, 1.5 and 10.6 kJ/mole, respectively.  
The overpotential of SSCCu electrodes at 700℃ and 800℃ with different current densities is 
shown in Fig. 6. For SSC and SSCCu01 samples, the overpotential increases with current density 
increases in the range of 0~250 mA/cm2, and reaches a stable value of 250 mV and 190 mV, 
respectively, as the current density increases to 400 mA/cm2. For SSCCu02 sample, the 
overpotential only slightly increases from 0 mV to 25 mV as the current density increase to 200 
mA/cm2 and reaches a stable value. The overpotential does not increase with current density 
increase up to 400 mA/cm2. The overpotential behavior of the SSCCu03 sample is similar to that of 
SSCCu02, but the maximum overpotential is 65 mV at 400 mA/cm2 at 700°C. It was found that the 
overpotential of SSCCu02 is much lower than that of the SSC, SSCCu01 and SSCCu03 samples. A 
 13
This is because the melting point of SSCCu samples decreases when the Cu doping amount 
increases. The thickness of all cathode electrodes was approximately 10 µm. Both SSC-SDC and 
SSCCu-SDC cathode electrodes exhibited good interfacial contact with the SDC electrolyte; no 
delamination was observed.    
The activation polarization of the cathode electrode due to charge transfer occurred in the 
interface between the cathode and the electrolyte. The cathode performance was investigated by the 
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique based on symmetrical cells. The EIS for 
the SSC, SSCCu01, SSCCu02 and SSCCu03 cathode electrodes on the SDC electrolyte recorded at 
700°C in air are shown in Fig. 9. It can be seen that the ASR of SSCCu is obviously lower than that 
of the SSC electrode. The ASR of SSC, SSCCu01, SSCCu02 and SSCCu03 electrode is 11.3, 7.3, 
0.2 and 0.5 Ω．cm2, respectively. The area-specific resistance versus the reciprocal temperature of 
SSC and SSCCu electrodes is shown in Fig. 10. The activation energy is 109, 75, 129 and 118 
kJ/mole, respectively. These values are much lower than that of LSCF cathode electrode [15]. The 
potential resistance of the cathode electrode is closely related not only to the charge transfer and the 
adsorption/dissociation of oxygen, but also to the transport speed of oxide ions through the bulk and 
across the cathode/electrolyte interface. Therefore, the kinetics of oxygen exchange and diffusion of 
oxide ions in the cathode materials as well as electronic conductivity play a critical role in the 
oxygen reduction reaction [16]. It is suggested that the kinetic of oxygen exchange and diffusion of 
oxygen in the SSCCu02 sample is higher than that in the other samples; therefore it exhibits the 
lowest overpotential and ASR, even though its conductivity is not the highest. For the SSCCu03

Abstract 
The structure, phase stability, and electrical properties of BaCe1-xYxO3-δ (x=0~0.4) in 
humidity air and CO2 atmosphere are investigated. XRD results indicate that the 
BaCe0.9Y0.1O3-δ sample has a symmetric cubic structure, and its phase changes to 
tetragonal as the Y3+ doping amount increases to 20 mol%. The conductivity of 
BaCe1-xYxO3-δ increases with temperature, and it depends on the amount of yttrium 
doping and the atmosphere. BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ exhibits the highest conductivity of 0.026 
S/cm at 750 ℃. The activation energy for conductivity depends on yttrium doping 
amount and temperature. The conductivity of BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ is 0.025 S/cm in CO2 
atmosphere at 750 ℃ which is 3.8 % lower than that in air due to reactions with CO2 
and BaCO3 and the CeO2 impure phases formed. The structure of BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ is 
unstable in water and decomposes to Ba(OH)2 and CeO2 phases. It is found that the 
activation energy of samples in CO2 atmosphere is higher than that of sample in air. 
Sr-doped Ba1-ySryCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ (y=0~0.2) is prepared to improve the phase stability of 
BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ in water. The conductivity of Ba0.9Sr0.1Ce0.8Y0.2O3-δ is 0.023 S/cm at 
750 ℃which was 11 % lower than that of BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ, however, the phase 
stability of Ba0.9Sr0.1Ce0.8Y0.2O3-δ is much better than that of BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ in water.

1. Introduction 
A Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is regarded as a highly efficient and clean 
power-generation system because of its high conversion efficiency and low pollution 
[1]. A conventional high-temperature SOFC (HT-SOFC) is based on the 8 mol% 
yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte, which requires operation at a high 
temperature range of 800~1000℃. However, such a high operation temperature 
causes many problems such as high cost, limitation of the materials for sealing and 
the current connector, reactions between the components, thermal expansion 
mismatch, and a long start-up and shut-off period, etc. Therefore, there has been 
considerable interest in SOFCs operating at an intermediate temperature range of 
600~800℃. A key issue in the development of intermediate temperature SOFCs 
(IT-SOFCs) is the use of a highly ion conductive electrolyte at intermediate 
temperatures. Recently, high temperature protonic conductors (HTPCs) have gained 
considerable attention because they are used as solid electrolytes for electrochemical 
devices such as IT-SOFCs, hydrogen sensors, hydrogen pumps, steam electrolyzers, 
etc. 
There are many kinds of perovskite-type oxides that have oxygen vacancies and 
p-type conductivity. Perovskite-type oxides such as BaZrO3, SrZrO3, SrCeO3 and 
BaCeO3 doped with a rare-earth oxide are known to be proton conductors. It was 
found that protonic conductivity appears as electronic conductivity decreases for these 
 35
 In order to exhibit proton conduction for BaCeO3, doping with lower valency 
cations, as well as introducing water vapor, is essential. A trivalent dopant such as 
yttria can lead to the creation of oxygen vacancies, as given by 
2CeCe
× + Oo× + Y2O3       2YCe’ +  Vo.. + 2CeO2          (1) 
These oxygen vacancies interact with the water vapor in the use environment to 
form protons, as given by 
Vo
..
  + Oo
×  + H2O (gas)             2OHo.                    (2) 
The water incorporation results in the uptake of two protons per oxygen vacancy in 
the structure. The concentration of protons in the material depends on the oxygen 
vacancy concentration and, therefore, also on the dopant content. The protons are 
quasi-free and generally not bound to any particular oxygen ions; they can migrate 
from one oxygen ion to another in the nearest neighbor oxygen ion in the lattice. This 
migration mechanism results in high proton conductivity (as high as 10-2 Ω-1cm-1 at 
500℃) for these HTPC oxides [16]. The doped BaCeO3 exhibited both ion and p-type 
electrical conductivity at higher temperatures in a high Po2 and dry atmosphere, 
whereas it was a pure ion conductor at lower temperatures in a low Po2 and moist 
atmosphere. The conductivity mechanism in doped perovskites was discussed was 
detail by Ma. et al. [17] and Haile et al. [13]. These results show that protons are 
actually associated with oxide ions to form hydroxide ions.

3. Results and Discussion 
The XRD patterns of BaCe1-xYxO3-δ calcined at 1300℃ for 12 h are shown in Fig. 
1. Fig. 1(a) gives the XRD pattern of BaCe0.9Y0.1O3-δ, where the structure is belongs 
to a perovskite cubic structure. The peaks include the (110), (111), (200), (211), (220), 
(310), (222), and (321) reflections. The lattice parameter a is about 4.391 Å, which is 
a little larger than that for BaCeO3 (4.377 Å, JCPDS no. 75-0431). For the 
yttria-doped BaCeO3 powders, it was expected that the lattice parameter would be a 
function of the yttrium doping concentration. The ion radius of Y3+ is 0.92 Å, which is 
greater than that of Ce4+ (0.9 Å); therefore, the lattice parameter and the unit cell 
volume should increase with the doping Y3+ concentration. However, oxygen 
vacancies were created in the lattice because, Y3+ doping in BaCeO3, the unit cell can 
also shrink. Therefore, the unit cell of BaCe1-xYxO3-δ can either increase or decrease 
with an increasing Y3+ doping concentration, depending upon the contributions of 
these two opposing factors. As the Y3+ doping amount increased above 20 mole%, it 
was observed that certain XRD peaks split, confirming that samples had a 
single-phase tetragonal perovskite-type structure. Iwahara et al.[19] studied the mixed 
conduction of Yb, Y, Dy, Gd, Sm, and Nd-doped BaCeO3, and reported that the proton 
transference number decreased while the oxygen ion transference number increased 
with a larger doping ionic radius. The reason for this is the enlarged spacing volume 
 41
samples shows an apparently change above 650℃. An Ea value of 73~101 kJ/mol is 
calculated in the low temperature range of 400~650℃. However, an Ea value of 
34~52 kJ/mol is obtained in the high temperature range of 650~750℃. This result 
indicated that the conductivity mechanism changes as the measured temperature of 
650℃. Dynys reported similar results, but the temperature for the conductivity 
mechanism change in this study was higher than that reported by Dynys [20]. The 
probable reasons for conductivity mechanism change are the phase transformations of 
BaCe1-xYxO3-δ and the charge carrier change from proton to oxygen-ion in high 
temperatures. The structure identification and oxygen-ion conductivity at 550~750℃ 
is still being in process.  
The conductivity of the bulk and grain boundary of BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ was 
determined by EIS. The Arrhenius plot of this is shown in Fig. 4. There is only one 
conductivity mechanism for bulk conductivity in the temperature range of 450~800℃. 
The activation energy of bulk conductivity is 51 kJ/mol. However, there are two 
conductivity mechanisms for grain conductivity in the temperature ranges of 
450~600℃ and 600~800℃. The activation energy of grain conductivity is 191 kJ/mol 
and 18 kJ/mol, respectively. It was found that the activation energy of grain 
conductivity is much higher than that of bulk conductivity at low temperatures. This 
result indicates that the diffusion of protons in the grain boundary is lower than that in 
 43
However, a large amount of BaCO3 and CeO2 impure phases was formed in the 
BaCe0.6Y0.4O3-δ sample; this is the main reason that the BaCe0.6Y0.4O3-δ sample does 
not exhibit conductivity behavior in a CO2 atmosphere.  
From the result described above, it was found that the BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ sample has 
the highest conductivity in both air and CO2 atmosphere, and the structure is more 
stable in CO2 for the other samples. Therefore, the structure of the BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ 
sample in water was further investigated. It is impossible to restrain the chemical 
reaction between BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ with water due to the negative Gibb’s free energy of 
this reaction below 403℃. However, it is possible to decrease the reaction rate. The 
XRD patterns of BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ exposed to a water vapor-rich environment at 80 ℃ 
at different durations are shown in Fig. 8. It was found that the structure of 
BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ is stable below 2 h. There is only a small amount of Ba(OH)2 phases 
formed at 4 h, as the time increases to 6 h, the  Ba(OH)2 and CeO2 phases are clearly 
observed. The perovskite main structure of BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ almost disappeared 
completely and reacted into the Ba(OH)2 and CeO2 phase with water.  
In order to improve the structural stability of BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ in water, Sr-doped 
BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ samples were prepared. Fig. 9 shows the conductivity of 
Ba1-ySryCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ (y=0~0.2) in air. The conductivity of Ba1-ySryCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ 
(y=0~0.2) samples decreased with the doping amount of Sr. The conductivity of 
 45
Conclusions 
The BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ exhibits the highest conductivity of 0.026 S/cm and 0.025 S/cm 
at 750℃ in air and CO2, respectively. However, the reaction rate of BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ 
with water is extremetly high, and the perovskite structure decomposes into Ba(OH)2 
and CeO2 phases after 8 h in water. Ba0.9Sr0.1Ce0.8Y0.2O3-δ has slightly lower 
conductivity, but the structural stability is much better than that of BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ. 
Ba0.9Sr0.1Ce0.8Y0.2O3-δ exhibits high conductivity of 0.023 S/cm at 750℃ and the 
perovskite structure is still remains after 8 h in water.

Abstract 
In this study, the potential candidates Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ (designed as BSCF) 
oxides, for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC) were 
successfully prepared with a combined citrate-EDTA complexing method. The BSCF 
precursor solutions were prepared from Ba(NO3)2, Sr(NO3)2, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 
Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, citric acid and EDTA-NH3 with pH values of 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. The 
precursors were dried and subsequently calcined at 950℃ for 12 h and sintered at 
1050℃ for 5 h. The crystal, chemical composition, and conductivity were studied by 
X-ray diffraction (XRD), inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS), 
energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) and four-point DC measurement. The X-ray 
diffraction results of all samples prepared from different pH solution revealed that the 
basic structure of perovskite was formed. Although samples prepared from different 
pH solutions have similar structure, however, chemical composition and grain 
morphologies are different. The optimized composition was found to be a BSCF 
electrode prepared from the precursor solution with a pH value of 6; this showed the 
highest conductivity at 50.2 S/cm at 400℃, which is 1.3 times higher than the sample 
prepared from the precursor solution with a pH value of 9.

oxygen vacancy concentration [2]. In 1985, Teraoka et al. reported a SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-δ 
(SCF) membrane with a very high oxygen permeation flux due to the high 
concentration of oxygen vacancies [3]. In 2001, Huang et al. applied SCF as the 
cathode materials for SOFC however, the phase is not stable at lower oxygen partial 
pressure [4]. In 2000, Shao et al. widely investigated Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ (BSCF) 
as an oxygen separation membrane [5]; it was found that the BSCF exhibits high 
oxygen permeation and acceptable conductivity. Recently, BSCF was applied as a 
new cathode material for IT-SOFC [6]. It exhibited a high power density of 1010 
mW/cm2 at 600℃ when using hydrogen as the fuel and air as the cathode gas.  
It is widely agreed that the oxygen electro-reduction process in the cathode 
electrode is a multistep electrochemical process, including: (1) diffusion of O2 from 
the gas phase to the surface of cathode; (2) dissociation of the chemisorbed oxygen 
molecule into atomic oxygen at the active site; (3) charge transfer; (4) diffusion of O2- 
from the cathode electrode to the cathode/electrolyte interface and into the electrolyte 
[7]. The excellent electrochemical performance of BSCF can be attributed to its high 
oxygen vacancy and high rate of oxygen diffusion. In fact, the oxygen diffusion flux 
is affected both in the chemical composition and the microstructure. It was reported 
that oxygen diffusion flux increases with a decrease in average grain size of BSCF 
materials [8]. However, it has been mentioned that the desired stoichiometric

2. Experimental  
In this study, BSCF powders were prepared using the citrate-EDTA complexing 
method. First, 0.04 mol of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, Riedel-dehaen, 
98%) was mixed with 50 ml 13 N NH4OH solution to make NH3-EDTA solution. 
Then, 0.01 mol of Ba(NO3)2 (J. T. Baker, 99.6%) was added to the NH3-EDTA 
solution, which was heated and stirred. Next, 0.01 mol of Sr(NO3)2 (Alfa Aesar, 
99.0%), 0.016 mol of Co(NO3)2．6H2O (J. T. Baker, 99.8%) and 0.004 mol of 
Fe(NO3)3．9H2O (Alfa Aesar, 98.0~101.0%) were dissolved in the other NH3-EDTA 
solution. These two solutions were mixed and stirred, then 0.06 mol of citric acid was 
added. The mole ratios of EDTA: citric acid: total metal ions were 1:1.5:1. The pH 
value was adjusted to 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10 by adding different amounts of NH4OH 
solution (designed as BSCF5, BSCF6, BSCF8, BSCF9, and BSCF10). Each solution 
was heated on a hotplate at 100℃ and stirred until the water evaporated and a sticky 
gel was formed. The gelled BSCF precursors were heated at 200℃ for 3 h. After heat 
treatment, the samples were calcined at 950℃ for 12 h. Finally, the samples were 
sintered at 1050℃ for 5 h.  
The phase identification of the BSCF powders was performed with a powder 
diffractometer (LabX, XRD-6000) with Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation, and the 
diffraction angle from 20

3. Results and discussion 
To confirm the formation of the BSCF oxide, the samples were analyzed using XRD. 
The XRD patterns of the BSCF powders are presented in Fig. 1. The five kinds of the 
BSCF powders, which were prepared from precursor solutions with different pH 
levels, were well indexed single-phase as a cubic ABO3 perovskite-type structure with 
a lattice parameter range of 3.9849 to 3.9873 A. This result show that the samples 
prepared from the precursor solutions with different pH values exhibited the same 
structure and phases.  
Fig. 2 shows the morphologies of the BSCF electrodes prepared from BSCF 
powders synthesized from precursor solutions with different pH values and sintered at 
1050℃ for 5 h. It was found that the microstructures of all the samples were porous 
and the gain size was in the range of 4.5~9.0 µm. This suggests that the powder 
characterization of all powders prepared from precursor solutions with different pH 
values are similar therefore, the microstructure of the BSCF sintered electrode is 
similar. 
A high electronic conductivity is important because it may result in a good 
current-collecting efficiency and a low ohmic resistance for a cathode electrode of 
IT-SOFC. It is well known that there are electronic and ionic conductivity 
mechanisms in a mixed ionic and electronic conductor (MIEC), due to the

The sample prepared from the precursor solution with a pH of 6 exhibited the 
highest conductivity of 50.2 S/cm, which is about 33% higher than that of the sample 
prepared from the precursor solution with a pH of 9 (37.7 S/cm). The electrical 
conductivity of all samples decreases as the temperature increases above 400℃. An 
increase in ionic conductivity with the increase in operating temperature should be 
expected due to the higher concentration oxygen vacancies and diffusion rate at 
temperature higher than 400℃. It is believed that the decrease of electronic 
conductivity at temperatures above 400℃ cause by the hopping of small polarsons. 
The concentration of various valence states of Co and Fe ions changed by the release 
of oxygen from the BSCF lattice, therefore, affect the electronic conductivity. The 
temperature at which the samples exhibit maximum conductivity in this study is much 
lowers than the reported of conductivity of about 33 S/cm at 570℃ by Wei et al [10], 
but similar to that reported by Shao et al. [15]. It is believed that the difference is due 
to the chemical composition’s slightly variation. Although the conductivity of all 
samples is lower than that of cathode materials, such as La0.8Sr0.2Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ 
(LSCF) [16], the loss of lattice oxygen upon heating can lead to the formation of

The ICP-MS and EDS analysis of the BSCF powders, which is given in Table 2, 
confirms the composition of the materials. The EDS data were measured at least 10 
points. The quantitative analysis of BSCF is difficult due to the oxygen vacancies 
concentration definition. However, it was found that the BSCF sample prepared from 
the precursor solution with a pH value of 6, had the best stoichiometric ratio and more 
homogeneous element distribution compared to the other samples. This is the major 
reason for it to exhibit better conductivity and electrochemical performance than other 
samples. These results suggest that the chelating between the EDTA or citric acid and 
metal cations was affected by the pH value of the precursor solution. Therefore, the 
composition of BSCF samples is different after heat treatment and affects the 
performance of BSCF electrodes.
