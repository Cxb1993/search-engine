中文摘要
在 IEEE 802.15.4無線個人網路中，某些即時
(Real-time)應用或需要傳送重要資料的服務必需
使用高可靠性的傳送。故傳送端在傳送資料到接
收 端 時 ， 必 須 使 用 交 握 機 制 (handshaking 
mechanism)。透過交握機制，傳送端可確定所傳
送之資料是否有正確送到接收端。在所有交握的
機制中，接收端傳送 ACK是最常被使用的方式。
當接收端正確收到資料(frame)封包時，會立即傳
送 ACK到傳送端通知資料封包已正確被接收。反
之，則不回送 ACK，此時傳送端得知剛才傳送的
資料無法正確被送到接收端，會立即進行重送程
序。
影響資料無法正確傳送到接收端的原因有三
種，分別是通道(Channel)的雜訊干擾、訊號碰撞
(Collision) 及 隱 藏 節 點 問 題 (Hidden node 
problem) ，但是在媒介存取控制層(MAC Layer)

英文摘要
In IEEE 802.15.4 networks (WPANs), the 
reliable data transmission may be an important issue 
when the delivered data frames containing important 
information. Hence, some handshaking mechanisms 
in literatures were proposed to guarantee successful 
data frame transmission. One of them adopts ACK 
frame, which is replied by the receiver back to the 
sender when the data frame is correctly received. If 
the sender cannot receive the ACK frame, the data 
frame will be retransmitted. However, there are 
many different reasons causing the ACK frame 
which cannot receive on the sender, such as the 
channel interference, data collision due to heavy 
traffic or data collision due to hidden terminal 
problem. 
For the different reasons, the sender should 
have different data retransmission policies and 
procedures. Neglect of these failed reasons, the data 
retransmission on sender will degrade system 
transmission efficiency. Hence, if the receiver can 
recognize the different reasons to inform the sender 
which makes a suitable decision for retransmission, 
the transmission efficiency can be improved. The 
recognition can be achieved via cross-layer design. 
In this proposal, we propose a cross-layer judgment 
scheme to solve the retransmission problem. It does 
not require extra cost for control overhead, but it can 
judge correctly the reasons of failed transmission via 
overlapping signals. Thus, the sender can adjust 
system parameters to process the retransmission 
procedure. 
Keywords: IEEE 802.15.4 WPANs, Retransmission 
Problem, Cross-Layer Scheme.

In Section 2, a background study of IEEE 802.15.4 
transmission procedure is briefly described. The 
reason analysis of the failed data frame receipt is 
discussed in Section 3. In section 4, our cross-layer 
judgment scheme (CL-JS) is presented. The results 
of extensive numerical experiments are 
demonstrated in Section 5. Finally, some 
conclusions are given in Sections 6.

2. BACKGROUND STUDY
The PHY layer in the IEEE 802.15.4 standard 
uses direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) 
scheme, and it supports three different data rates 
based on different radio ranges from 10 to 100 
meters. The system block diagram of IEEE 802.15.4 
PHY is shown in Fig. 1. At the transmitter side, data 
bits from the MAC layer are first divided into 
several groups of four bits. Each four-bit sequence is 
then mapped to one of the sixteen possible symbols 
and each symbol is spread to the associated 32-chip 
sequence [5]. Note that the spread sequences are 
pseudo-random and nearly orthogonal. The chip 
sequence is then modulated using O-QPSK (Offset 
Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) modulation with 
half-sine pulse-shaping. Finally, the modulated 
signal is transmitted into wireless channel. At the 
receiver side, the inverse procedures are conducted. 
The received signal is first demodulated into 32-chip 
sequence. Based on the associated 16 possible 
symbols, the obtained chip sequence correlates to 
one of them, and a symbol with the highest 
correlation is selected. Finally, the complete bit 
stream is sent to the MAC layer. 
Two important parameters, energy detection 
(ED) and average counter number (ACN), are used 
in the paper. ED is defined in IEEE 802.15.4 PHY 
layer [5]. It is used for channel estimation. The ED 
is generally used to obtain the received signal 
strength at the receiver. If ED detects a large 
variation of the received signal strength at the 
receiver, it is very likely to have the overlapped 
signals. In IEEE 802.15.4, the receiver will correlate 
and choice the received chip to one of sixteen 
possible symbols, and a symbol with the highest 
correlation is selected. We define that ACN is the 
number of error correction during receiving frame at 
the receiver. The large ACN infers serious 
transmission interference. 
The topology of IEEE 802.15.4 networks has 
two architectures: the star and peer-to-peer 
topologies. In a star topology, the communication is 
established between end devices and a single central 
controller (called coordinator). In a peer-to-peer 
topology, a device can communicate with other 
devices within its radio range. IEEE 802.15.4 MAC 
layer specifies two modes of medium access: the 
beacon-enabled mode and the non-beacon-enabled 
mode. In the beacon-enabled mode, a beacon frame 
is transmitted by the coordinator. The beacon frame 
contains information about timing synchronization, 
system configuration, a list of devices to receive 
data frames from the coordinator and so on. On the 
contrary, in the non-beacon-enabled mode, devices 
allow to send data frames whenever necessary. This 
paper focuses on the beacon-enabled network with 
the star topology. 
Figure 2 shows a superframe structure for the 
beacon-enabled mode network. A superframe 
consists of an active period and an inactive period. 
Two important parameters for this superframe 
structure are beacon order (BO) and superframe 
order (SO) [5]. In the beginning of an active period, 
the coordinator sends a beacon frame that includes 
the values of BO and SO to all devices. These two 
parameters can determine the lengths of active and 
inactive periods. They are respectively equal to 
48× 2𝑆𝑂  UBPs (unit backoff periods) and 
48×(2𝐵𝑂−2𝑆𝑂) UBPs, where the UBP is used as a 
basic unit of the backoff period. 
The active period are divided into two parts. 
The first part is contention access period (CAP), and 
the second part is contention free period (CFP). The 
coordinator is in charge of the adjustment for the 
lengths of CAP and CFP based on traffic loads and 
request types. The channel access in CAP uses a 
4 
frames to the same receiver, the receiver results in 
large ACN which does not represent the dirty 
wireless channel. Similarly, ED represents the signal 
strength of receiver but it also does not represent all 
situations. The signal strength on receiver is changed 
when an obstacle is in between sender and receiver. 
However, the fading channel, the collision and the 
HDP will form the different variations of ED and 
ACN. 
To find out which reasons cause the 
retransmission problem, the receiver first tries to 
detect the preamble locations of the received PHY 
frames. The preamble sequence of the PHY frame 
consists of 8 continuous data symbols 00000000. 
It is located at the beginning of the PHY frame. 
Therefore, the receiver (coordinator) constantly 
correlates the chip sequences of the preamble from 
the received signals. Once the peak correlation value 
is observed, the coordinator asserts that a preamble 
sequence is found. Here, we observe the values of 
ED and ACN during the received PHY frame. By 
comparing the values of ED and ACN, we can judge 
the reasons of failed frame transmission. 
Two threshold values, EDthreshold and 
ACNthreshold, are defined [6]. By comparing ED to 
EDthreshold and ACN to ACNthreshold, there are four 
possible cases to determine the results of frame 
transmission. In addition, if a frame incurs the 
fading channel plus the collision or the HDP during 
transmission frame we determine that the reason of 
transmission failure is the HDP. 
1. If ED ≥ EDthreshold and ACN < ACNthreshold,
the coordinator infers that the channel is clean.
The devices transmit frame in CAP. No need
to use GTS or inactive period in this case.
2. If ED < EDthreshold and ACN < ACNthreshold,
the coordinator also infers that the channel is
clean. For small ED, perhaps an obstacle is in
between sender and receiver. Due to the small
ACN, we conclude that the channel
interference is low. Hence, the devices
transmit frame in CAP. No need to use GTS or
inactive period.
3. If ED < EDthreshold and CAN ≥ ACNthreshold,
the coordinator concludes that the fading
channel causes failed frame transmission.
Such devices are allocated to transmit in the
inactive period of following superframe.
4. If ED ≥ EDthreshold and ACN ≥ ACNthreshold,
this indicates that the reasons of failed frame
transmission are the collision or the HDP.
However, the strength of ED is exactly
overlapped from the beginning to the end of 
the PHY frame, and we infer that the failed 
frame transmission is due to the collision. 
Otherwise, we conclude that the result of the 
failed frame transmission is from the HDP. 
Our simulation in Rayleigh fading environment 
with realistic channel estimation shows that the 
receiver can correctly determine which the reasons 
of failed frame receipt with a probability 86% up in 
Table 1. 
The computation complexity of our detection 
operation in the receiver (coordinator) is analyzed as 
follows. Let n be the number of devices supervised 
by the receiver, and m be the number of devices 
occurring the collision or the HDP. The frame length 
is assumed to be k. First, the preamble (0000....0) is 
correlated to the received signal in a sliding window 
manner, sliding from the beginning to the end of the 
overlapped signal. The length of the overlapped 
signal with m collided frames is at most (𝓂 ∗ 𝑘 − 
(𝓂−1)) bits. On the other hand, the procedures after 
preamble is detected are conducted at most m times 
(if the preamble from all m collided frames is all 
detected, which is generally not possible). In 
conclusion, the overall time complexity of our 
preamble is O(𝓂 ∗ 𝑘). 
Once the failed frame is received on the 
receiver (coordinator), the actions of the coordinator 
are according to the reasons of failed frame 
transmission. For the fading channel or the HDP, the 
coordinator broadcasts a special acknowledgement 
frame (NACK) to stop initiating the retransmission 
procedure of the devices. One flag bit in the ACK 
frame is used in CL-JS to distinguish the NACK 
from the standard ACK. For a device, it has to 
awake and process the frame when it wants to 
transmit/receive the frame. If this device does not 
transmit/receive any frame, it will enter sleep mode 
for power saving. Hence, the NACK frame is only 
received by the awake device with the failed frame 
transmission. Then, the coordinator uses the 
following beacon frame which includes the reason 
of transmission failure to inform the sender. 
In the collision situation, when the sender does 
not receive the ACK or NACK, it starts the 
retransmission procedure of IEEE 802.15.4 standard. 
In other words, the coordinator does not transmits 
the ACK or NACK in collision situation. In 
additional, the replied ACK frame of the coordinator 
may occur transmission failure but the interference 
of failed ACK frame only comes from the fading 
channel. In the star topology, the replied ACK frame 
6 
coordinator is independently Rayleigh distributed 
and the noise at the coordinator is additive white 
Gaussian noise. Each device estimates the channel 
gain of its link to the coordinator from the received 
signal portion of the preamble sequence. The 
channel estimation is then applied in the PHY layer 
to detect the remaining data contained in the PHY 
frame.

Situations Correctness Probability 
Fading Channel 99% 
Collision 97% 
HDP 86% 
Figure 5: Effects of traffic load on system 
goodput, power consumption and MAC delay. 
5.2 Simulation Results 
From Table 1, we obtain the precise reason of 
failed transmission. The correctness probability is 
defined that an interference phenomenon appears in 
frame transmission, and we obtain correct reason of 
transmission failure by using our CL-JS. The CL-JS 
first distinguishes the fading channel case from all 
transmission failure cases. Subsequently, the cases 
of the collision and the HDP are distinguished 
depending on the location of overlapped signals. 
Though the probabilities are not 100%, the CL-JS 
still can improve the retransmission efficiency 
significantly. 
In order to investigate the performance of 
CL-JS, we compare the different performance 
metrics for CL-JS and IEEE 802.15.4 standard with 
50 devices. Figure 5 (a) shows the effect of the 
traffic load on goodput. We observe that the goodput 
of CL-JS outperforms IEEE 802.15.4 standard. The 
probability of retransmission failure is decreased by 
CL-JS because the reasons of transmission failure 
can be more correctly decided and the proper 
retransmission procedure is adopted. Moreover, the 
goodput difference between CLJS and 
IEEE802.15.4 standard gradually increases when the 
traffic load increases. When traffic load is heavy, the 
probability of failed frame transmission also 
becomes large, and retransmission procedure is 
required repeatedly. Hence, CL-JS substantially 
decreases transmission overhead and increases 
goodput. Figure 5 (b) shows the effect of traffic load 
on power consumption for CL-JS and IEEE 
802.15.4 standard. In wireless sensor networks, 
power consumption is a major issue. The power 
consumptions of CL-JS and IEEE 802.15.4 standard 
are also gradually increased when the traffic load 
increases. However, with the effective reduction of 
failed frame transmission, the increasing rate of 
CL-JS power consumption is less than IEEE 
802.15.4 standard. 
Figure 5 (c) shows the MAC delay of CL-JS 
and IEEE 802.15.4 standard. This figure intuitively 
shows that the MAC delay under CL-JS and IEEE 
802.15.4 standard increases as traffic load increases. 
We find the MAC delay of IEEE 802.15.4 is lower 
than that of CL-JS in the heavy traffic load. In IEEE 
802.15.4, more retransmission process for a specific 
frame may be repeatedly activated due to severe 
transmission failure. Each retransmission incurs 
additional contention overheads and degrades 
system performance. In CL-JS, a frame can be 
successfully delivered with a low opportunity of 
failed frame transmission, which implicitly 
decreases the transmission overhead for a frame 
transmission. Although CL-JS can significantly 
reduce the occurrence of failed frame transmission, 
the MAC delay would be increased since some of 
the devices are arranged to GTS and inactive period 
of next superframe.  
6. CONCLUSIONS
A simple and efficient cross-layer scheme, 
CL-JS, has been proposed in this paper to solve the 
retransmission problem in IEEE 802.15.4 WPANs. 
The proposed scheme detects the frame signal and 
determines the reasons of failed frame transmission 
in the PHY layer, and then uses the different 
schemes in the MAC layer for retransmitting frame. 
The proposed cross-layer scheme significantly 
reduces the chance of failed transmission. 
Simulation results show that the proposed CL-JS is 
very effective in enhancing the goodput, as well as 
reducing the MAC delay and the power 
consumption.

一、 參加會議經過
本次會議的會議地點是在美國德州的南方大城 San Antonio，自己從桃園機場出發到日本東京
NARITA 機場轉機，從東京 NARITA 機場再到芝加哥的 O'HARE 機場，再從芝加哥的 O'HARE 機
場飛往德州 Austin的 BERGSTROM機場，最後再開車從 Austin到 San Antonio，算是路程相當遙遠
的一趟行程。
這次參加會議，我發表的論文是被安排在 Network Computing track，時間是在會議的第二天。
這次會議的會場是在 University of Texas at San Antonio。在 Network Computing track中，發表的論文
主題主要圍繞在網路應用服務方面。由於網路應用服務的發展相當快速，利用此次的會議可以了解
一些網路應用服務發展的現況，像是如何增加 RFID 的判讀之正確性以增加它的應用層面，或是如
何將現在使用的 IPv4 格式轉換成可以容納更多使用者之 IPv6 格式，而不需要花費太多的成本等等
的熱門議題。關於我自己發表的論文，則是在探討 IEEE 802.15.4重送的問題。IEEE 802.15.4的設
計原則是短距離低功率的特性，很適合被應用在無線感測網路上面。過去 IEEE 802.15.4的重送問題
大多數是調整媒介存取層的參數，像是倒退視窗的大小來進行資料的重送，然而這些文獻都沒考慮
到有很多原因會影響封包傳送失敗，像是 fading channel、collision或是 hidden node problem等。這
些原因都會導致封包傳送失敗，單純依靠媒介存取層的重送機制並無法了解是什麼原因造成有效封
包傳送失敗解，所以無法改善當封包重送時的成功率。
因此我們提出了一個跨階層式(Cross-Layer)的重送方法來解決不同原因所產生的封包傳送失
敗。首先我們先利用實體層的參數 energy detect(ED)及 average counter number(ACN)來決定是什麼原
因造成封包傳送失敗，ED是接收端用來判斷通道能量的大小，如果 ED變化很大表示在接收端可能
有多個訊號同時傳送或是訊號重疊的狀況發生。ACN表示接收端在接收封包時需要對封包做更正的
