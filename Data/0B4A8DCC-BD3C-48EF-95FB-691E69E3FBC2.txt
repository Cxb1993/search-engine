三、前言 
Nowadays, the improvement of reliability is very critical for portable and mobile electronic products. 
Therefore, many studies focus on the properties of solders and metal-pads interconnection in the 
microelectronic package.1-2 Minor element, e.g. Zn,3-5,7-8 Ni,3-4 Mn,3-4 Ti,3-4 Fe,3-4 Co,3-4 and rare earth,6 
additions to the Sn-Ag-Cu solders is expected to strengthen the mechanical properties of solder joints. Zn is 
one of the appropriate elements with lots of advantages for soldering. (I) As minor Zn is doped into the 
near-ternary-eutectic Sn-Ag-Cu solders, the large Ag3Sn can be effectively suppressed, and then fatigue-crack 
is avoided to propagate along the large Ag3Sn.7 (II) The interfacial reaction between the Zn-doped solders and 
the Cu pads is retarded, resulting in the thinner and void-free intermetallic compounds (IMCs) at the joint 
interfaces.5,8-9 (III) The electromigration resistance for Cu atoms is also enhanced due to the strong binding of 
Zn with Cu.10 
In the advanced microelectronic packages, the composition and structure of Cu pads are also the key 
factors to influence the solder joints.11-12 Another way to improve the reliability of the solder joints is to 
design a better substitute for the Cu pads. Cu-Zn alloy is a potential material to replace the Cu pads, which has 
many positive effects, i.e. (I) the suppression of large Ag3Sn formation and (II) the reduction of interfacial 
IMCs, similar to the effects of Zn-doped solders.13-15 Besides, the interfacial segregation and embrittlement of 
bismuth are eliminated in Sn-Bi/Cu-10Zn solder joints.16 The most interesting is the excellent drop resistance 
for the Cu-Zn components.13 In the solders/Cu-Zn joint system, Cu and Zn dissolve from the Cu-Zn substrates 
into the molten solders during reflow. Thus, the reflow time and the Zn concentration in the Cu-Zn substrates 
control the amount of Zn into the solders. The composition of solders should affect the microstructure and the 
phase formation. In order to realize the correlation, this study aims to investigate the microstructural variation 
and phase evolution regarding the interfacial reaction of Sn-xAg-0.5Cu (x= 1.0 and 3.0 wt.%) solders and 
Cu-yZn (y= 0, 15, and 30 wt.%) substrates after reflow for various periods of time.

五、結果與討論 
Microstructural Variation and Phase Morphologies in the Solders 
Figure 1 shows the cross-sectional images of SAC105/Cu and SAC305/Cu solder joints after reflow for 
0.5, 2 and 10 min. The microstructure of the SAC105 and SAC305 solders near the interfaces varied with the 
reaction time. In the SE images, the white area was the eutectic region, which was composed of fine-lamellar 
Ag3Sn, Cu-Sn phases, and β-Sn phase. The dark area was mostly β-Sn phase. In comparison with SAC105/Cu 
and SAC305/Cu, the less amount of Ag in the SAC105 solders implied the finer eutectic regions in the 
SAC105/Cu. When the periods of reflow time increased, the growth of fine-lamellar Ag3Sn resulted in the 
decrease of eutectic regions in both SAC105 and SAC305 solders. The phase morphologies are revealed in the 
BSE images (Fig. 1). Most Cu6Sn5 formed at the joint interfaces, while some were inside the solder matrixes. 
The amount of Cu6Sn5 in the SAC105 solders was larger than that in the SAC305 solders, and it became 
coarsened with the reflow time. This phenomenon can be explained by the Sn-Ag-Cu phase diagram at the 
Sn-rich corner,17 in which the Cu solubility in Sn-Ag-Cu alloy at 240 oC decreased from 5.3 to 3.1 wt.% as the 
amount of Ag decreased from 3.0 to 1.0 wt.%. Therefore, the lower Cu solubility in the SAC105 solders 
should induce Cu6Sn5 precipitating easily, leading to the large amounts of Cu6Sn5 in the SAC105 solders. 
In the SAC105/Cu-15Zn and SAC305/Cu-15Zn solder joints, the microstructural variation and phase 
morphologies are shown in Fig. 2. From the SE images, same as the joints on the Cu substrates, the eutectic 
region in the SAC105 solders was smaller than that in the SAC305 solders. However, the eutectic region in 
both SAC105 and SAC305 solders became much coarser on the Cu-15Zn substrates than that on the Cu 
substrates. In addition, the area of the eutectic region became significantly larger after reflow for longer time. 
The variation of eutectic region was considered to correlate with the degree of undercooling. Kang et al. 
demonstrated that minor Zn doped into the Sn-3.8Ag-0.7Cu solder could strongly reduce the degree of 
undercooling, therefore, the growth of large Ag3Sn plate during cooling was suppressed.7 Cho et al.’s study 
also proves that the undercooling of the Sn-rich solders in solder/Cu-Zn joints is much lower than that in 
solder/Cu joints.18 Therefore, in this study, Zn dissolution from the Cu-15Zn substrates into both SAC105 and 
SAC305 solders can effectively reduce the degree of undercooling. As a result, fine-lamellar Ag3Sn in the 
 7
did not react with Sn. The variations of Zn amount within both SAC105 and SAC305 solders on the Cu-15Zn 
substrates were nearly identical, which increased from 0.4 to 0.7 wt.% as the reflow time increased from 0.5 
to 2 min. It was observed that the higher Zn concentration in the solders enhanced the growth of eutectic 
region. When the solders/Cu-15Zn joint was reflowed for 10 min, the Zn concentration maintained around 0.7 
wt.%, and the area of eutectic region was unchanged. Thus, the composition and the microstructure of the 
SAC105 and SAC305 solders on the Cu-15Zn substrates approached dynamic equilibrium after reflow for 2 
min. 
Due to the higher supply of Zn atoms from the Cu-30Zn substrates, the Zn concentration of the solders 
was higher than that in the Cu-15Zn case, and it increased with the reflow time. After 10 min, 1.2 and 1.8 
wt.% Zn was detected in the SAC105 and SAC305 solders, respectively. These samples were selected for 
further analysis to realize the elemental distribution inside the solders, as shown in the color mapping of Fig. 4. 
Fig. 4(a) reveals that partial Zn would congregate to the eutectic region in the SAC105 solder. In fact, the 
eutectic phase is the last solidified phase during cooling. The Zn in the eutectic region can be regarded as the 
nucleation site to accelerate the solidification of these solders and thus the degree of undercooling was 
reduced. Besides, parts of Zn would congregate to Cu6(Sn,Zn)5 and the fine Cu-Zn phase. The mapping shows 
that the Zn and Cu distribution is similar, in other words, Zn prefer to incorporate with Cu. The dispersion of 
Zn atoms created large amounts of nucleation sites for the precipitation of Cu6(Sn,Zn)5 and the fine Cu-Zn 
phases. More nucleation sites indicated that Cu6(Sn,Zn)5 and fine Cu-Zn IMCs were dispersed and difficult to 
grow by ripening. Accordingly, fewer large compounds were revealed in the SAC105 solders on the Cu-15Zn 
and Cu-30Zn substrates than those on the Cu substrates. 
Similar to the SAC105 solder, the distribution of Zn in the SAC305 solder was identical to those of Cu 
and Ag. Most Zn congregated at the eutectic region, as shown in Fig. 4(b). In addition to fine Cu-Zn phase, 
fine Ag-Zn phase was found in the eutectic region. Therefore, Zn in the solders increased the volume fraction 
of eutectic region after reflow for a long period of time. The quantitative analysis and the color mappings 
illustrate that the amount of Zn dissolved from the Cu-yZn substrates affects the microstructure and the phase 
formation of the solders significantly.

two kinds of solder joints might be related to the geometry of Cu6(Sn,Zn)5. 
Two possible formation mechanisms for the Cu(Zn,Sn) phase are proposed. (I) One is inferred from the 
transformation from Cu6(Sn,Zn)5 with high Zn content. According to the Sn-Cu-Zn phase diagram (Fig. 7),20 
as the Zn concentration in Cu6(Sn,Zn)5 is higher than 6 at.%, Cu6(Sn,Zn)5 may transform to Cu(Zn,Sn) at 250 
oC. This can be confirmed by the measured composition in Cu6(Sn,Zn)5. In Table II, the amount of Zn within 
Cu6(Sn,Zn)5 in the Cu-30Zn solder joints increased much faster than that in the Cu-15Zn solder joints during 
reflow. It should be noted that the Cu(Zn,Sn) phase was not found in Cu6(Sn,Zn)5 with Zn contents lower than 
6 at.%, e.g. solders/Cu-15Zn, and solders/Cu-30Zn after reflow for 2 min. When SAC105/Cu-30Zn and 
SAC305/Cu-30Zn were reflowed for 10 min, Cu(Zn,Sn) appeared, and the Zn concentration in Cu6(Sn,Zn)5 
reached 6.2 and 7.2 at.%, respectively. (II) The other is that interfacial Cu6(Sn,Zn)5 with saturated Zn, i.e. 6 
at.%, blocks the Zn diffusing out of the Cu-30Zn substrates. Thus, the Zn concentration would increase at the 
interfaces between Cu6(Sn,Zn)5 and Cu-30Zn substrates during reflow. The local composition gradually 
approaches the critical one to form Cu(Zn,Sn). These two mechanisms do not conflict between each other, yet 
it takes more efforts to be confirmed. From current results in this study, it was clearly demonstrated that the 
phase evolution at the solders/Cu-30Zn interfaces was strongly affected by the reflow time due to the 
compositional variation in Cu6(Sn,Zn)5.

composition affects its microstructure and phase
formation. To investigate such a correlation, this
study aims to investigate the microstructural
variation and phase evolution regarding the inter-
facial reaction of Sn-xAg-0.5Cu (x = 1.0 wt.% and
3.0 wt.%) solders and Cu-yZn (y = 0 wt.%, 15 wt.%,
and 30 wt.%) substrates after reflow for various
periods of time.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Commercial Sn-1.0Ag-0.5Cu (SAC105) and
Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu (SAC305) solders with washable
flux were reflowed on three kinds of Cu-yZn
(y = 0 wt.%, 15 wt.%, and 30 wt.%) substrate to form
Sn-xAg-Cu/Cu-yZn solder joints. The compositions
of the solders and the substrates were evaluated
by a field-emission electron probe microanalyzer
(FE-EPMA; JXA-8500F, JEOL). The diameter of the
Sn-xAg-0.5Cu solder balls was 300 lm, and the size
of the Cu-yZn substrates was 12 mm 9 12 mm, with
a thickness of 0.3 mm. Before reflow, the Cu-yZn
substrates were smoothed and deoxidized by pol-
ishing. The reflow process was carried out at 250C
for 0.5 min, 2 min, and 10 min, followed by cooling
by air.
Cross-sections of Sn-xAg-Cu/Cu-yZn joints were
prepared by polishing and ion-beam milling (RES-
101 Ion Beam Milling Device; BAL-TEC). Second-
ary-electron (SE) and backscattered electron (BSE)
modes of scanning electron microscopy were used to
observe the microstructure and the interfacial
morphologies. The phase composition and the
elemental distribution were determined by quan-
titative analysis and color mapping modes of
FE-EPMA, respectively. To evaluate the average Zn
and Cu concentration in the solders, five regions
near the central region of the solders were selected
and measured using a probe size of 30 lm. Addi-
tionally, the average thickness of the IMCs at the
interface was evaluated with the aid of image-
analysis software.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Microstructural Variation and Phase
Morphologies in the Solders
Figure 1 shows cross-sectional images of SAC105/
Cu and SAC305/Cu solder joints after reflow for
0.5 min, 2 min, and 10 min. The microstructure of
the SAC105 and SAC305 solders near the interfaces
varied with reaction time. In the SE images, the
white area corresponds to the eutectic region, which
was composed of fine-lamellar Ag3Sn, Cu-Sn phases,
and the b-Sn phase. The dark area was mostly the
b-Sn phase. In comparison for SAC105/Cu and
SAC305/Cu joints, the lower amount of Ag in the
SAC105 solders implied finer eutectic regions in
the SAC105/Cu joint. As the reflow time increased,
the growth of fine-lamellar Ag3Sn resulted in the
decrease of eutectic regions in both SAC105 and
SAC305 solders. The phase morphologies are
revealed in the BSE images (Fig. 1). Most Cu6Sn5
formed at the joint interfaces, with some inside the
solder matrixes. The amount of Cu6Sn5 in the
SAC105 solder was greater than that in the SAC305
solder, and it became coarser with reflow time. This
phenomenon can be explained based on the Sn-Ag-
Cu phase diagram at the Sn-rich corner,17 in which
the Cu solubility in Sn-Ag-Cu at 240C decreases

joints did not vary with reflow time. It was argued
that most dissolved Cu would react with Sn to form
Cu6Sn5 [or Cu6(Sn,Zn)5] at the interface. The for-
mation of interfacial Cu6Sn5 [or Cu6(Sn,Zn)5]
blocked the dissolution of Cu into the solders, and
the Cu concentration in all the solders approached
dynamic equilibrium and did not increase after
reflow for 0.5 min.
In contrast, the supply of Zn solute from the Cu-
15Zn substrate was lower than that of Cu solute,
and Zn did not react with Sn. The variations of the
amount of Zn within both SAC105 and SAC305
solders on the Cu-15Zn substrate were nearly
identical, increasing from 0.4 wt.% to 0.7 wt.% as
the reflow time increased from 0.5 min to 2 min.
It was observed that a higher Zn concentration in
the solder enhanced the growth of the eutectic
region. When solder/Cu-15Zn joints were reflowed
for 10 min, the Zn concentration remained around
0.7 wt.%, and the area of the eutectic region was
unchanged. Thus, the composition and microstruc-
ture of the SAC105 and SAC305 solders on the
Cu-15Zn substrate approached dynamic equilib-
rium after reflow for 2 min.
Due to the greater supply of Zn atoms from the
Cu-30Zn substrate, the Zn concentration of the sol-
ders was higher than in the Cu-15Zn case, and it
increased with reflow time. After 10 min, 1.2 wt.%
and 1.8 wt.% Zn was detected in the SAC105 and
SAC305 solders, respectively. These samples were
selected for further analysis to determine the ele-
mental distribution inside the solders, as shown in
the color maps of Fig. 4. Figure 4a reveals that some
of the Zn would congregate to the eutectic region in
the SAC105 solder. In fact, the eutectic phase is the
last phase to solidify during cooling. The Zn in the
eutectic region can be regarded as the nucleation
site to accelerate the solidification of these solders,
and thus the degree of undercooling was reduced.
Besides, some of the Zn would congregate to
Cu6(Sn,Zn)5 and the fine Cu-Zn phase. The mapping
shows that the Zn and Cu distributions are similar;
in other words, Zn prefers to incorporate with Cu.
The dispersion of Zn atoms created large amounts of
nucleation sites for precipitation of Cu6(Sn,Zn)5 and
the fine Cu-Zn phases. More nucleation sites indi-
cated that Cu6(Sn,Zn)5 and fine Cu-Zn IMCs were
dispersed and difficult to grow by ripening.
Accordingly, fewer large compounds were revealed

in the SAC105 solder on the Cu-15Zn and Cu-30Zn
substrates than on the Cu substrate.
Similar to the SAC105 solder, the distribution of
Zn in the SAC305 solder was identical to those of Cu
and Ag. Most Zn congregated at the eutectic region,
as shown in Fig. 4b. In addition to a fine Cu-Zn
phase, a fine Ag-Zn phase was found in the eutectic
region. Therefore, Zn in the solders increased the
volume fraction of the eutectic region after reflow
for a long period of time. The quantitative analysis
and the color maps illustrate that the amount of Zn
dissolved from the Cu-yZn substrates affects the
microstructure and the phase formation of the sol-
ders significantly.
Phase Evolution and Compositional
Variation at the Interfaces Between
the Solders and the Substrates
In the SAC105/Cu-yZn and SAC305/Cu-yZn sol-
der joints, Cu6Sn5 [or Cu6(Sn,Zn)5] was the domi-
nant IMC formed at the interfaces, as shown in
Figs. 5 and 6. The Cu6Sn5 [or Cu6(Sn,Zn)5]
compound in all SAC305 solder joints exhibited a
scallop-like morphology, while it showed a layered
morphology in all SAC105 solder joints. These dif-
ferent morphologies were attributed to the driving
force for the dissolution of Cu6Sn5 [or Cu6(Sn,Zn)5]
and diffusion of Cu into the liquid Sn. For the solder/
Cu joints, the high local dissolution and diffusion
rate between two Cu6Sn5 grains render the scallop-
type Cu6Sn5.
19 In contrast, layered Cu6Sn5 phases
form between Cu and the molten solder with satu-
rated Cu due to the low local dissolution and diffu-
sion rates.19 The Cu solubility of SAC105 solder is
lower than that of SAC305 solder. It was believed
that the Cu concentration in the SAC105 solder
near the interface was saturated after 0.5-min reflow,
leading to the layered Cu6Sn5 or Cu6(Sn,Zn)5 mor-
phology. Therefore, the amount of Ag affects the
morphology rather than the type of IMC. In addition to
Cu6Sn5, a thin Cu3Sn layer formed between Cu6Sn5
and the Cu substrate, as shown in Fig. 5a and b.
Previous studies have shown that the addition of
Zn to Cu substrates for Sn-based solder joints can
effectively suppress the formation of Cu3Sn,
13–15
and the driving force of Cu3Sn formation decreases
with increasing Zn content in Cu-Zn substrates.5 In
this study, no Cu3Sn was found, and Cu6(Sn,Zn)5
was the only phase at the SAC105/Cu-15Zn and
SAC305/Cu-15Zn interfaces after reflow, as shown
in Fig. 5c and d, respectively. From the quantitative
analysis (Table II), the Zn concentration of the
Cu6(Sn,Zn)5 phase in both SAC105/Cu-15Zn and
SAC305/Cu-15Zn solder joints was nearly identical,
and increased with reaction time. In contrast with
the fixed Zn and Cu concentration in the solders
after reflow for 2 min, this result demonstrated that
Zn would tend to accumulate in the interfacial
Cu6(Sn,Zn)5.

Yu and Duh2632
confirmed by the measured composition in
Cu6(Sn,Zn)5. In Table II the amount of Zn within
Cu6(Sn,Zn)5 in the Cu-30Zn solder joints increased
much faster than that in the Cu-15Zn solder joints
during reflow. It should be noted that the Cu(Zn,Sn)
phase was not found in Cu6(Sn,Zn)5 with Zn con-
tent lower than 6 at.%, e.g., solder/Cu-15Zn joints,
and solder/Cu-30Zn joints after reflow for 2 min.
When SAC105/Cu-30Zn and SAC305/Cu-30Zn joints
were reflowed for 10 min, Cu(Zn,Sn) appeared,
and the Zn concentration in Cu6(Sn,Zn)5 reached
6.2 at.% and 7.2 at.%, respectively. (2) The other
is that interfacial Cu6(Sn,Zn)5 with saturated Zn,
i.e., 6 at.%, blocks the Zn diffusing out of the
Cu-30Zn substrate. Thus, the Zn concentration
would increase at the interfaces between Cu6(Sn,
Zn)5 and the Cu-30Zn substrate during reflow. The
local composition gradually approaches the critical
one to form Cu(Zn,Sn). These two mechanisms do
not conflict with each other, although more effort is
required to confirm this. From the current results in
this study, it is clear that the phase evolution at the
solder/Cu-30Zn interfaces was strongly affected by
the reflow time due to the compositional variation in
Cu6(Sn,Zn)5.
CONCLUSIONS
This study demonstrates the microstructural
variation and phase evolution in the reaction of
Sn-xAg-Cu (x = 1.0 wt.% and 3.0 wt.%) solders and
Cu-yZn (y = 0 wt.%, 15 wt.%, and 30 wt.%) sub-
strates during reflow. In SAC105 solder, the area of
the eutectic region was much smaller than in the
SAC305 solder. The amount of Zn in the solders
varied with reflow time and the various Cu-yZn
substrates. As the Zn concentration increased in
both solders, the eutectic region became signifi-
cantly coarser. The precipitation of large-sized
Cu6Sn5 and Cu6(Sn,Zn)5 was effectively reduced as
Zn dissolved into the SAC105 solder. In the Cu-30Zn
solder joints, most Zn would congregate to the
eutectic phase and prefer to combine with Cu and
Ag to form fine Cu-Zn and Ag-Zn phases.
At different joint interfaces, various phases
evolved with reaction time. Cu6Sn5 or Cu6(Sn,Zn)5
was the dominant product in each solder joint. The
layer-type morphology was revealed in all SAC105
solder joints, while a scallop-type morphology was
observed in all SAC305 solder joints, due to the
different Ag and Cu concentration in the solders.
The Ag content did not affect the type of IMC at the
interfaces. After reflow for 10 min, Cu6Sn5 and thin
Cu3Sn formed at the solder/Cu interfaces, while
only Cu6(Sn,Zn)5 formed at the solder/Cu-15Zn
interfaces. At the solder/Cu-30Zn interfaces,
Cu6(Sn,Zn)5 was the only phase after reflow for
2 min. When the reaction time was increased to
10 min, the Zn concentration in Cu6(Sn,Zn)5
increased above 6 at.%, leading to the formation of
the Cu(Zn,Sn) phase between Cu6(Sn,Zn)5 and the
Cu-30Zn substrate. Two formation mechanisms of
Cu(Zn,Sn) are proposed in this study to elucidate
the composition variation due to the interfacial
reaction. The Zn concentration in the Cu-yZn sub-
strate strongly affects the microstructure of both
SAC105 and SAC305 solders, as well as the phase
evolution at the joint interfaces.

The effects of Ni doping on microstructural variations and interfacial reactions
in Cu/Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu-xNi/Au/Ni sandwich structures were investigated. The
sandwich structures, i.e., Cu/Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu/Au/Ni and Cu/Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu-
0.1Ni/Au/Ni (wt.%), were reflowed and isothermally aged at 150C for 500 h.
The behavior of Ni and Cu migration in the solders before and after aging was
investigated using field-emission electron probe microanalysis (FE-EPMA),
and the microstructure evolution of the solders with Ni doping was investi-
gated. It was observed that Ni migrated to the board Cu-side, while Cu tended
to migrate toward the Ni/Au package side, and two different types of
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 intermetallic compounds (IMCs), one with 19.8 at.% to 23.4 at.%
Ni and the other with 1.3 at.% to 6.4 at.% Ni content, were found. Regarding
interfacial reactions, it was identified that the local Ni and Cu concentrations
affected the formation of (Cu,Ni)6Sn5. Redistribution of Ni and Cu was cor-
related with the formation mechanism of interfacial (Cu,Ni)6Sn5.

INTRODUCTION
Ni and Cu are common surface finishes used in
microelectronic packages, such as under bump
metallurgy (UBM), substrates, and printed circuit
boards (PCBs).1,2 In the past, Sn-Pb alloys were the
appropriate materials for solder joints. Nowadays,
near-eutectic Sn-Ag-Cu alloys are widely used to
replace Sn-Pb alloys due to environmental con-
cerns.3,4 To improve solder joint reliability, many
studies have attempted to add minor elements, e.g.,
Ni,5–8 Zn,7–9 Mn,7,8 Ti,7,8 Fe,7,8 Co,7,8 and rare
earths,10 to Sn-Ag-Cu solder alloys. In addition to
the effects on solder fatigue properties under
thermal cycling, such minor doping can affect
mechanical and thermal properties, due to variable
combinations of interfacial reactions between solder
and surface finishes.
Ni is one of the additional alloying elements that
can enhance the drop and impact resistance of
solder joints.5,6 It is reported that 0.05 wt.% Ni
added to Sn-0.7Cu solder can mitigate crack for-
mation at the IMC layers between the solder and Cu
substrate.11 In addition, a Ni concentration in
Sn-2.5Ag-0.8Cu solder larger than 0.005 wt.% can
effectively suppress the formation of Cu3Sn at the
interface.12 These are due to the effects of minor
additions of Ni on the interfacial reactions of
Sn-Ag-Cu and Sn-Cu solders with Cu substrates.
Nevertheless, when these solders reacted with Ni
and Cu substrates in flip-chip applications, cross-
interaction occurred. Such cross-interaction was
attributed to Cu and Ni diffusion from one side to
the other between the Cu and Ni substrates. Wang
and Liu reported that various microstructures

decreased slightly to that adjacent to the Cu pad at
the SAC-0.1Ni/Cu interface.
The evolution of IMCs in these two assemblies on
aging is shown in Fig. 4c and d. (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 became
thicker and grew into a layer type in both samples.
In addition to (Cu,Ni)6Sn5, thin (Cu,Ni)3Sn formed
at both SAC/Cu and SAC-0.1Ni/Cu interfaces.
A few Kirkendall voids were found around the thin
(Cu,Ni)3Sn layer. The quantitative analysis in
Table II demonstrates that the average Ni concen-
tration in (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 decreased as new Cu6Sn5
grew due to the Cu flux from the substrate reacting
with Sn after aging. The Ni content in (Cu,Ni)3Sn
was less than that in (Cu,Ni)6Sn5, implying that Ni
prefers to congregate into (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 rather than
in (Cu,Ni)3Sn under this condition. The variation of
IMC thickness is plotted in Fig. 5. The IMCs at the
SAC-0.1Ni/Cu interface were thicker than at the
SAC/Cu interface, both before and after aging,
indicating that Ni addition to the SAC solder
increased the growth rate of interfacial (Cu,Ni)6Sn5.
Moreover, the thickness of the Cu3Sn in the
Ni-doped solder joints was similar to that in the
nondoped solder joints.
The elemental distribution at the interface as
revealed in Fig. 4 is represented in Fig. 6, which can
be used to visualize Ni migration during aging. At
the as-reflowed SAC/Cu and SAC-0.1Ni/Cu inter-
faces, most Ni dissolved into the interfacial
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5, and the distribution was uniform. In
addition to the contribution from the Ni/Au surface
finish, more Ni was supplied from the solder matrix
with Ni doping. Therefore, the Ni content in the
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 layer for the SAC-0.1Ni/Cu interface
was larger than for the SAC/Cu interface. This is
consistent with the results of quantitative analysis
showing that the average Ni concentration in the
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 at the SAC-0.1Ni/Cu interface was
higher than that at the SAC/Cu interface. Some
Ni- and Cu-rich phases were scattered inside the
eutectic region in the Ni-doped SAC solders, which
were considered to be (Cu,Ni)6Sn5. This provides
further evidence that Ni doping in the solder
induced nucleation of (Cu,Ni)6Sn5.
After aging, the distribution of Ni in the interfa-
cial (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 was nonuniform. A Ni-enriched
region was revealed in the bottom part of the
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 layer at the SAC/Cu interface and
congregated near the Cu-side. In contrast, parts of
Ni-enriched region were congregated near the
Cu-side, and some were scattered in the (Cu,Ni)6Sn5
at the SAC-0.1Ni/Cu interface. This difference
could be correlated with the morphology of the
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 in the as-reflowed samples. It is well
known that Cu at the substrate diffuses through the
interfacial IMCs into the solder mainly via grain-
boundary diffusion.3 From Fig. 4b, the block-like
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 with a loose structure provides more
paths for Cu diffusion out of the substrate. This is
one of the reasons why (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 at the SAC-
0.1Ni/Cu interface grew thicker than that at the
SAC/Cu interface. During aging, new (Cu,Ni)6Sn5
with less Ni would form in the gaps between the
block-like (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 grains, leading to a decrease
of the average Ni concentration in the (Cu,Ni)6Sn5.
Thus, the as-reflowed (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 with a higher Ni
content was surrounded by new (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 with a
lower Ni content.
IMC Formation and Elemental Distribution
at the Ni/Au Side
At the Ni/Au-side, (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 was still the only
IMC at the interface in both Ni-doped and nondoped
systems. No trace of (Ni,Cu)3Sn4 was identified at
the interface for samples aged after 500 h. The Cu
source for the (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 was migration of Cu from
the solders and dissolution of the Cu pads during
reflow. In Fig. 7a and b, needle-like (Cu,Ni)6Sn5
formed at the Ni/Au/SAC and thin-layered
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 at the Ni/Au/SAC-0.1Ni interface after
reflow. The aging process caused all the interfacial
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 to become layered and thick, as shown
in Fig. 7c and d. The thickness of the IMCs at
the Ni/Au-side was much smaller than that at the
Cu-side. In contrast, thickness variations at the
Cu- and Ni/Au-sides were different. The average
thickness of the (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 is plotted in Fig. 8. The
growth rate of (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 at the Ni/Au/SAC-0.1Ni
interface was slower than that at the Ni/Au/SAC
interface.
To further visualize the Ni and Cu distributions,
local regions with thick IMC were selected for
analysis by high-magnification color mapping, as
shown in Fig. 9. It is interesting to note that
there were two types of (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 formed at the
as-reflowed Ni/Au/SAC interface (Fig. 9a): One, with
a higher Ni content, represented as H-(Cu,Ni)6Sn5,
was adjacent to the Ni/Au surface finish interface,
and the other, with a lower Ni content, indicated as
L-(Cu,Ni)6Sn5, was located near the interface. As
presented in Table III, the quantitative analysis
showed that the average Ni concentration was from
Fig. 5. Average thickness of total IMCs at the solder/Cu interfaces.
Yu, Lee, Tsai, Liu, and Duh2548
to the fact that the the SAC-0.1Ni solder supplied
more Ni to congregate in (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 at the
Ni/Au-side during reflow. Ni would not only migrate
to the Cu-side, but also to the Ni/Au-side. After
aging, the H-(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 grew slowly; however,
the L-(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 grew significantly between
H-(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 and solder in both solder joints, with
and without Ni doping. In the meanwhile, the
composition of H-(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 was nearly constant.
In contrast, the Ni content within L-(Cu,Ni)6Sn5
at the Ni/Au/SAC interface increased slightly.
The formation of L-(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 was attributed to
dissolved Cu in these solders, which migrated toward
the Ni/Au-side and reacted with Sn. From Table I,
the Cu concentration decreased in the middle of the
solders and increased near the Ni/Au-side, confirm-
ing Cu migration from the solder to the Ni/Au-side
during aging.
Based on these results, the H-(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 mainly
formed at the Ni/Au-side during the liquid reaction.
This means that the formation of H-(Cu,Ni)6Sn5
needs enough Ni source at the high temperature.
Hence, the (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 at the Cu-side is all
L-(Cu,Ni)6Sn5, with 1.3 at.% to 4.3 at.% Ni. Accord-
ing to the literature,3,16 Ni within the Cu6Sn5 can
stabilize the structure, and the Gibbs free energy of
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 decreases by around 9 kJ/mol as the Ni
content increases to 20 at.%. Energy and density-
of-states calculations show that the compound
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 is more stable than Cu6Sn5, since there
is a large driving force for Ni dissolution into
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5, and Cu4Ni2Sn5 is the most stable phase.
17
In this study, the composition of H-(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 is
similar to that of the stable Cu4Ni2Sn5 compound,
therefore, H-(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 was considered as the
most stable IMC in this system. In fact, the stan-
dard Gibbs energy of formation of Ni3Sn4 (24.1 kJ/
mol) is much lower than that of H-(Cu,Ni)6Sn5
(16.0 kJ/mol).3 The thermodynamic analysis
shows that Ni3Sn4 possibly forms at the interface.
However, no Ni3Sn4 was found when the Cu/SAC/
Au/Ni and Cu/SAC-0.1Ni/Au/Ni systems were aged

0.1 wt.% Ni to the SAC solder joints resulted in a
finer eutectic region and induced finer compound
formation than without Ni doping. During aging, it
was identified that Ni migrated toward the Cu-side,
and Cu migrated toward the Ni/Au-side. Most Ni
congregated into the (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 and affected the
interfacial reactions.
Two types of (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 were detected, contain-
ing 1.3 at.% to 6.4 at.% Ni in L-(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 and
19.8 at.% to 23.4 at.% Ni in H-(Cu,Ni)6Sn5. At the
Cu-side, no H-(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 was observed. Scallop-
like L-(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 formed at the SAC/Cu interface,
and block-like L-(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 formed at the SAC-
0.1Ni/Cu interface after reflow. These different mor-
phologies resulted in faster growth of L-(Cu,Ni)6Sn5
in the Ni-doped system than in the nondoped
system during aging. In addition, the lower Ni
concentration and scattered Ni distribution in
L-(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 at the SAC-0.1Ni/Cu interface
was related to the formation mechanism of
L-(Cu,Ni)6Sn5.
At the Ni/Au-side, needle-like H-(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 and
a small amount of L-(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 formed at the Ni/
Au/SAC interface after reflow. However, only thin
layered H-(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 was found at the Ni/Au/SAC-
0.1Ni interface. After aging, H-(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 grew
slowly, while L-(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 grew significantly. The
phase evolution resulted from migration of Cu and
Ni atoms in the solders. The growth rate of these
two types of (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 in the Ni-doped system was
slower than in the nondoped system. It is demon-
strated in this study that minor Ni doping sub-
stantially affects the microstructural variations and
interfacial reactions in these systems.
