Electrochemical polishing is regarded as the most potential technology for IC 
planarization process. Currently the constant voltage and current methods are mostly used 
to polish the copper-plated wafer.  Its mechanisms are to make the formation of mass 
transfer control on copper surface and reach the goal of planarization.  However, this 
characteristic could not planarize thin copper layer with large area.  This study suggested 
a method to improve the above problem by applying pulse current and by adding copper 
ions and one organic chelating agent.  The experimental results show the pulse current 
including cathodic and anodic duty could obtain better surface quality than constant anodic 
current.  The mechanisms were analyzed by polarization curve and electrochemical 
impedance method.  The main processes contain the cathodic deposition of the sacrificed 
copper and anodic dissolution of the excess copper.  The surface with very low roughness 
could be finished by repeating the cathodic and anodic duty and by controlling the on/off 
time parameters, i.e. tc-on = 1 ms, tc-off = 1 ms, ta-on = 50 ms, tc-off = 10 ms, ic = 40 mA, 
ia = 30 mA and Tcd/Tad = 3/7.  The planarization of the copper-plated wafer with large 
area was also achieved using this condition better than the constant current method.

Introduction 
Transparent conducting oxide (TCO) films have been widely employed as a pixel 
electrode in flat panel display devices, such as liquid crystal displays (LCD) and organic 
light emitting diodes (OLED), due to its excellent optical transparency and good 
electrical conductivity. Additionally, with the rapid development of photovoltaic industry, 
TCO films are also an important material for fabricating solar cells.  
However, small variations in the films leave TCO residues after electropolishing and 
also cause the sidewall consumption of TCO films [1, 2, 3]. These non-uniform 
electropolishing results would worsen the electrical property of the TCO electrode and 
might lead to uncontrollable sidewall shape [4]. Therefore, the electropolishing process of 
TCO films must be studied to optimize the process for the mass production of the flat 
panel display. 
Different TCO films require different electropolishing solutions. Conventional 
etchants are generally composed of strong acids, such as halogen acid [5-7], and aqua 
regia [4]. The corrosion of underlying metal films is, however, serious during patterning 
TCO films using strong acids [8], and the residual halide also degrades devices [4]. 
Therefore, weak acid etchants are increasingly used for TCO films instead of strong acids, 
and  acid is the most frequently applied weak acid. 
However, the mechanisms of TCO electropolishing using  acids have seldom been 
investigated. Hence, this study explored the  acid solutions applied to etch TCO films. 
Potential–pH diagrams and open circuit potentials (OCP) were used to examine the 
electropolishing behaviors of TCO films. By means of the analysis of TCO chemical 
reaction rate, a surface protonation and ligand-adsorption mechanism was proposed and 
solution containing only  acid, and the insoluble M2A could dissolve to M2(A)22− with 
increasing pH.  
 
The EDS spectra were employed to analyze the relative composition of the TCO 
films as shown in Fig.3, where Si, Al and Ca peaks result from the glass under TCO, In 
and M2 peaks are from TCO films, and O peak might come from both the glass and TCO 
films. It was found the original counts of M1-peak and M2-peak in Fig. 3 were 1178 and 
553, respectively. After TCO films were etched in 0.35 M  acid for 1 min at 35 ºC, the 
counts of M1-peak and M2-peak decreased to 659 and 412, respectively. Obviously, the 
removal of M1 oxide from TCO films was quicker than M2 oxide. This result could have 
been explained by the discussion of Fig. 2 that in 0.35 M  acid the M1 oxide could 
dissolve but the M2 oxide might not. Hence the M1 oxide in TCO films was etched faster 
than M2 oxide in acid.   
However, the M2 oxide may still be removed as solid-state M2A or M2 oxide by 
stripping followed with the dissolution of the M1 oxide. These phenomena of stripping 
can be observed with an optical microscope. The OM images in Fig. 4 show TCO films 
on glass were patterned to 2-μm wide bars after electropolishing with 0.35 M  acid at 35 
ºC. It was obvious that TCO films was removed by dissolution along with stripping, but 
significant amount of residual materials from stripping were produced and distributed 
around the TCO bars.  
 
Referring to the dissolution mechanisms of the general oxides, such as Fe(III) oxide 
and Al(III) oxide, the surface protonation behavior seems important, and their dissolution 
rates are promoted in the presence of proton and complex-forming ligands [9-11]. 
obviously. However, the rotating action helpfully decreased the residual materials around 
the TCO bars after electropolishing, so Fig. 9 (a) displays less spots than those in Fig. 4. 
Figure 9 (b) also shows TCO electropolishing with ultrasonic vibration would further 
reduced the residues of TCO patterned surface due to the strong transporting action and 
resulted in a clear surface of TCO bars on glass. Consequently, mass transport action 
during electropolishing would be applied to sweep the residual materials away, but not to 
accelerate the electropolishing rate of TCO films.   
  
Conclusions 
The electropolishing kinetics of TCO films in  acid solutions has been discussed in 
this study. The results of potential–pH relation and EDS measurement both illustrated that 
the M1 oxide in TCO films was etched faster than M2 oxide in  acid, revealing that 
TCO films might form M1(A)2− and insoluble M2A. However, these insoluble species 
could still be removed by stripping during the dissolution of M1 oxide, but many solid 
residues would be formed after electropolishing. A possible reaction scheme with 
protonation and ligand-adsorption for TCO electropolishing in  acid was proposed. It 
was found that the kinetics was both related to the concentrations of A2− and H+. The 
consistency between the proposed mechanism and experimental results was proved, 
demonstrating the electropolishing of TCO films was the reaction controlled. The 
experiments also indicated the electropolishing rate of TCO films was independent of the 
stirring or vibration of  acid solutions, but enhancing mass transport action would 
decrease the residual materials around TCO bars and improve the electropolishing 
uniformity.
