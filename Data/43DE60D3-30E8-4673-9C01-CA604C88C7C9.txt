1. Introduction 
 
In practice, there are two general approaches 
achieving the goal of process control: statis-
tical process control (SPC) and engineering 
process control (EPC). A particular type of 
EPC approaches that will be addressed in 
this paper is called “adaptive extremum 
control.” It is well known from control en-
gineering that the goal of an adaptive ex-
tremum controller is to seek the optimum 
setting of control variables that keeps the 
process output at the extremum value and 
then continuously fine-tunes the process op-
erating at its optimum despite model mis-
match and/or the influence of system dy-
namics and noise disturbances. 
 In contrast to process monitoring ap-
plied in the phase of conventional control 
charting for the detection and thus removal 
of assignable causes of variation, process 
adjustment is referred to as another variabil-
ity-reduction tool for the process compensa-
tion or regulation, also known as engineer-
ing process control (EPC), where an ad-
justment to manipulable process variables is 
made in an attempt to keep the process out-
put as close as possible on some target value. 
One main group of EPC designs involves 
the notion of feedback control, a most recent 
application of which to microelectronics 
industry leads to run-to-run (R2R) control 
schemes (del Castillo and Hurwitz 1997) in 
semiconductor manufacturing. 
 Successful implementation of the most 
popular R2R controllers in semiconductor 
community lies in a fundamental assump-
tion that the functional relationship associ-
ating the compensating (or recipe) variables 
and process output of interest is in the form 
of linearity (Sachs, Hu and Ingolfsson 1995 
and Patel and Jenkins 2000). It implies that 
if this assumption holds in general, then 
several complex semiconductor processes 
can be well represented by the transfer func-
tion models (Box, Jenkins and Reinsel 1994) 
fitted from experimental data collected in a 
pre-control stage. However, nonlinear ef-
fects among semiconductor process vari-
ables often seem critical; for example, the 
chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) 
process is a typical case of that kind (del 
Castillo and Yeh 1998 and Fan 2000b). If 
nonlinearities were noticeable, the existing 
R2R regulators (such as EWMA-based con-
trollers) would not be adequate for the con-
trol purposes. The traditional method of 
physical principle models is ideal for the 
specific tasks of electronics-model building; 
yet sufficient knowledge of the chemistry, 
physics and the internal dynamics is neces-
sary to build a model (Nanz and Camilletti 
1995). In semiconductor practice, these 
conditions are rarely completely met or the 
physical models may not even exist. There-
fore, if nonlinear complexity can be taken 
into consideration while designing a con-
troller, better control performance can be 
anticipated as compared to the linear ones. 
The previous statement is one of the primary 
concerns addressed in this research. 
 Nearly all the R2R controllers are 
model-referenced, denoting that a model is 
first envisioned as a base from which to de-
vise a controller. In the vast majority of re-
alistic environments, multiple outputs are

constant terms (or intercepts) pβ  and sβ ;

Note that the matrices pB  and sB  are 
symmetric. For the inequality constraint in 
equation (1), ρ  is the radius used to re-
strict the search on the variables μ  inside 
the spherical experimental region where the 
responses were fitted. 
Here, we call model (1) as the “dual re-
sponse systems (DRS).” Partly motivated by 
the ridge analysis procedure developed by 
Draper (1963), the dual response approach 
introduced by Myers and Carter (1973) is a 
contour-based approach, which, essentially, 
is constructed based on the Lagrange 
method in the context of constrained opti-
mization from nonlinear programming 
(NLP). Like ridge analysis, the dual re-
sponse approach produces a locus of coor-
dinates of control variables where various 
values of the predicted secondary response 
function ˆsy  are considered. 
 
2.2. Constrained Nonlinear Optimization 
Assuming a suitable constraint qualification 
(i.e., the gradient of the binding constraints 
are linearly independent (see, e.g., Luen-
berger 1984)), a necessary condition for lo-
cal optimality of a feasible point μ  is the 
existence of Lagrange multipliers ,μ θ  
such that 
( ) ( )1
2p s s p
μ θ− + = −Β B I μ μβ β    (2) 
where ,μ θ  additionally satisfy 0θ ≥  and 
0θ =  whenever 2ρ′ ≤μ μ . If the matrix 
( )p sμ θ− +Β B I  is positive definite, then it 
can be shown that μ  is a global optimum 
for (1) (Fan 2000a). The latter result sug-
gests taking values for ,μ θ  that ensure the 
matrix ( )p sμ θ− +Β B I  positive definite. 
This technique was recommended as part 
contour-based method in Myers and Cater 
(1973), and later developed into a formal 
algorithm, DRSALG (Semple 1997). 
 
2.2.1. DRSALG 
DRSALG was designed to search the (con-
vex) region Γ  define by 
( ) ( ), :

for values of ,μ θ  that make the μ  ob-
tained from (2) feasible in (1). If μ  is

solution found to improve accuracy. Since 
degeneracy indicates ( ) 1 dd s p Eμμ − ⊥β β , 
thus the original axes, say 
* * * *
1 2, ,..., kμ μ μ ′⎡ ⎤= ⎣ ⎦μ , are rotated so that the 
eigenvector 1q  associated with the smallest 
eigenvalue 1λ  of ( )p sμ−Β B  becomes 
the first axis 1z  in the new coordinate sys-
tem based on the orthonormal basis 
[ ]1 2 k=Q q q qM MLM . Herein, 1q  can be 
quickly computed via a few steps of Inverse 
Iteration. Then, Q  can be formed by util-
izing the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization 
procedure (see, e.g., Golub and van Loan 
1984). By the rotational transformation via 
= Qzμ  illustrated in figure 1, (1) becomes

where ˆp p′ ′= Qβ β% , ˆp p′=B Q B Q% , ˆs s′ ′= Qβ β% , 
and ˆs s′=B Q B Q% . The radial constraint does 
not change in the new z -coordinates be-
cause Q  is orthonormal ( ′ =Q Q I ). 
Degeneracy results from orthogonality on 
the direction of 1q , so removing 1z 's effect 
from (5) can effectively rectify this compu-
tational difficulty around dμ . Consequently, 
1z  is selected as the grid variable; namely, 
1z  satisfies 1ρ ρ− ≤ ≤z  and this interval 
can be equally divided into many subinter-
vals by many grid points (illustrated in fig-
ure 2).  If 1z  is, in turn, fixed at each grid 
point, then (5) is decomposed into a series 
of DR subproblems having ( )1k −  control 
factors. New matrices, vectors, intercepts, 
and radii need adjustments to account for 
the fixed grid variable. Each subproblem 
with lower dimensions is created and swiftly 
solved by DRSALG, and the best solution 
found among the subproblems is earmarked. 
In order to increase accuracy, a new 
working (or bracketing) interval for 1z  is 
constructed by two grid points adjacent to 
the best solution obtained in the first pass of 
grid search. Then, the best solution found in 
the second pass (local refinement) can be 
transformed back to the original variables 
through = Qzμ . 
DR2 will find global optimal solutions 
of the nondegenerate DR problems by call-
ing DRSALG as a subroutine, and will use 
the procedures aforementioned to return an 
approximate global optimal solution (due to 
the computational accuracy dictated by the 
mesh used in the grid search) in degenerate 
cases. While solving too many subproblems 
would appear to compromise the speed of 
the procedure, it has been found that this is 
not the case in practice. First, many of the 
subproblems are infeasible, and these are 
screened quickly and discarded in the initial 
phase of DRSALG. Second, if the grid axis 
is constructed carefully, the majority of 
subproblems will be nondegenerate, and 
convergence will be quite swift. 
In contrast to DRSALG for nondegen-
erate problem, it is impossible to claim that 
grid point procedure (del Castillo, Fan and 
Semple 1999) will produce an exact global 
optimal solution for degenerate problems. 
However, since the grid method surveys as 
much of the feasible region as possible, it is 
reasonable to expect a more accurate ap-
proximation to the global optimum than 
would be obtained using a local search pro-
 8
vector, which contains the parameter esti-
mates ,ˆs tβ , ,ˆs tβ  and ,ˆ s tB  at discrete time 
t , if the full quadratic model is considered. 
The RLS algorithm with constant trace can 
thus be formulated as follows: 
Initialization: 
Let 1t =  and ( )2 3 2 / 2n n p+ + = . Let 
0μ  be the initial recipe at time 0, 0P  an 
initial matrix and λ  the constant of dis-
counting factor.

end. 
 
In the foregoing algorithm, the dis-
counting factor λ  with a value less than 
1.0 is very useful for tracking the parame-
ters in time-varying systems and during the 
initial transient phase of self-tuning. The 
usual range of λ  is set between 0.95 and 
1.0. tK  is a 1p×  vector of weights and 
tP  is a p p×  matrix proportional to the 
variance-covariance matrix of the parameter 
estimates. Measurements of a performance 
function in extremum control are typically 
noise-corrupted. It is then necessary to 
compensate for the influence of the noise. 
Thus, the intrinsic noise-resistant features of 
ST are of great value in the concept of an ST 
extremum controller addressed in this study. 
 
3. ADROC Algorithm 
 
The preceding subsection has examined all 
the components of adaptive dual- response 
optimizing controller (ADROC). The aim of 
the ADROC that follows is to use a 
straightforward idea from dual response ap-
plications and then match parameterized 
input-output data to the approximate repre-
sentation given by (1). The matching proc-
ess proceeds in a manner to construct a 
well-behaved, “adaptive” extremum objec-
tive function (via recursive estimation) that 
accurately represents the nonlinearities of 
the process locally about the current operat-
ing conditions. Subsequently, an optimiza-
tion step based on the TR-based (or 
dual-response) approach is carried out so as 
to try to achieve the eventual goal of extre-
mum control. 
For illustration, the block diagram of 
the ADROC in an R2R control simulation 
scheme is demonstrated in figure 3. For the 
clarity of presentation, the flow of the 
ADROC algorithm is summarized as fol-
lows: 
1. Provide the quadratic model in (1) with 
a set of initial parameter estimates from 
an off-line design of experiments; that is, 
,0
ˆ
pβ , ,0ˆsβ , ,0ˆpβ , ,0ˆsβ , ,0ˆ pB , and ,0ˆ sB , 
and compute the initial bounds on the 
Lagrange multiplier μ  via computa-
tion of three TR subproblems. Start the 
time index with 0t = . 
2. If the DRS is found degenerate, then use 
AXIS algorithm to decompose and solve

where ( ) [ ]53 / 52 1, 1t t′ = − ∈ − + , implying 
that the age of the polishing pad ranges from 
1 to 105, and afterwards a new pad is 
switched on. It needs to reset the scaled time 
variable t′  once the first 105 wafer polish-
ing would have been done. The random er-
ror term 1,tε  for the primary response is 
assumed a white series to obey ( )20,30N , 
and the random error term 2,tε  for the sec-
ondary response follows ( )20,60N , both 
estimated from the mean squared error 
(MSE) of the raw data. From (6-7), we note 
that the models are considerably more com-
plex than quadratic approximations since the 
t′variable appears in quadratic and 2-factor 
interaction terms. 
 
4.2. Performance Measures, Initial Pa-
rameter Setting and Simulation 
To begin with experimental studies, 50 in-
dependent simulations of 200 wafers (batch) 
each were run for collecting the computa-
tional results. The performance measures 
utilized herein contain the averages and 
standard deviations of the open-loop and 
closed-loop performance function values 
( openy , closedy , openS , closedS ), and the average 
and standard deviation of the ith controllable 
variable ( iμ , iSμ ). Besides, the standard 
errors of all the evaluation statistics were 
also assessed. In addition, the RLS method 
with the constant trace algorithm is applied 
with a fixed discounting factor 1.0λ =  and 
0 =P I  in the estimation block. 
To provide initial models, sy  was 
modeled by a full quadratic polynomial plus 
drift and py  by a model with linear terms 
and 2-factor interactions plus drift. The ini-
tial models (see, e.g., del Castillo and Yeh 
1998) were specified as follows:

which illustrate the case where reasonable 
initial models are provided to start the 
ADROC. The equality constraints on the 
outputs together with strict target values are 
useful in this example as removal rate is 
usually a “closer-the-better” response and 
non-uniformity a “smaller-the-better” re-
sponse. 
For illustration, a simulation of 200 
wafers is pictorially demonstrated in figure 
4, including both the closed-loop and 
open-loop control outputs. In lower part of 
figure 4, it was found that the closed-loop 
control outputs by the ADROC satisfy both 
process output constraints ( 1700sy > , 
200py <  as before) but the open-loop con-
trol outputs cannot meet these requirements 
(see also table 1). The upper part of figure 4 
presented all four control variables of the 
closed-loop in this scenario. Obviously, the 
ADROC is able to keep all control variables 
inside the constraint 1 1iμ− ≤ ≤ . 
In table 1, the upper part displayed two
