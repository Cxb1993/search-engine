Preparation of ductile PLA nanocomposites with improved thermal stability 
Abstract 
Polylactide (PLA) is used as a biomedical material because they are biodegradable, but the vast majority 
of biodegradable polymers in clinical use are composed of rather stiff materials that are unsuitable for use in 
numerous applications because they exhibit limited extendibility, weak mechanical strength, and poor thermal 
stability. We modified PLA with 2-methacryloyloxyethyl isocyanate (MOI) to prepare ductile PLA materials. 
By utilizing a novel sol-gel process, PLA nanocomposites were further prepared with improved mechanical 
properties and thermal stability. The 10% thermal decomposition temperature for PLA modified with 5% MOI 
and 5-10% silica was 31-36°C higher than that of original pristine PLA. Elongation at break increased by 4-13 
times when compared to neat PLA while the tensile strength was maintained at 30-40 MPa. These synthesized 
PLA nanocomposites can be applied as biomaterials with improved mechanical and thermal properties.

2.4 Characterization 
 Fourier transfer infrared (FTIR) measurements were carried out on a Bio-Rad Digilab FTS-40 IR 
spectrometer under N2 purging. Both the transmission and the attenuated total reflectance (ATR) FTIR spectra 
were recorded at a resolution of 8 cm
−1
 and accumulation of 16 scans. 
1
H and 
13
C NMR spectra were 
performed on Bruker AMX-400 and AV-500 spectrometers at 400 and 500 MHz, respectively. Solid-state 
29
Si 
NMR was obtained on Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer. 
Thermogravimetric analyses were performed with a Perkin-Elmer Pyris 1 TGA instrument at a heating 
rate of 20
o
C/min in nitrogen atmosphere to determine the thermal decomposition temperature. Differential 
scanning calorimetry (DSC) data were obtained from a Perkin-Elmer Pyris Diamond DSC. The samples 
(about 8 mg) were pre-sealed into an aluminum pan, heated to 200 
o
C and held for 2 min, then cooled to the 
desired temperature. Samples were scanned at a heating rate of 10
 o
C /min under N2.  
The wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) pattern of the sample was recorded on a Rigaku RINT 
2000 (Rigaku Corp. Tokyo, Japan) using Nickel-filtered CuKα radiation (40KV, 100 mA) with the 2θ value 
ranging from 3
o
 to 40
 o
 at a scanning rate of 1
o
/min. The morphologies of the fracture surfaces of hybrid 
materials were visualized with a JEOL JSM-6700 scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an accelerating 
voltage of 3-5 kV. The samples for transmission electron microscope (TEM) study were prepared by placing 
polymer films in an epoxy resin and curing the resin at 60
 o
C for 48 h. The cured epoxies containing 
PLA-silica were microtomed with a diamond knife into ~70 nm thick slices and placed on a 200-mesh copper 
grid and examined with a Hitachi H-7100 TEM using an acceleration voltage of 75 KV. 
An Instron universal tester model 3369 was used to study the stress-strain behavior. The load cell used 
was 5 Kg and the crosshead rate was 5 mm/min. Measurements were performed with film specimens (1.35 cm 
wide, 6 cm long and 50~60 μm thick). To measure impact strength, these films were hot pressed to make 
Izod-type test specimen according to ASTM D256. 
2.5 Preparation of PLA fibers by electrospinning 
PLA (10 wt%) was dissolved in chloroform solvent to prepare a polymer solution. The setup for our 
electrospinning apparatus consists of a syringe pump (Cole-Parmer), for controlled current (2A) and applied 
voltage. The voltage of 12 kV (DC power supply PS/ER 50R06 DM22, Glassman High Voltage Inc., USA) 
was applied to the syringe needle with a 0.8 mm inner diameter. The electrospinning was performed under the 
following conditions: flow rate of 2.0 mL/h, an applied voltage of 12 kV and a tip-to-distance of 20 cm. 
3. Results and Discussion 
3.1 Structure characterization 
Based on the chemical structures of PLA, MOI, and the experimental results of our previous studies 
[16, 17], a sol-gel reaction scheme was proposed in Scheme 1.  
The FT-IR spectra of PLA and MOI-modified polymer nanocomposites are shown in Fig. 1. For PLA, it 
shows two main intense absorptions at 1758 cm
-1 
and 1208 cm
-1
 corresponding to C=O and C-O stretching 
groups, respectively. PLA modified with MOI exhibits characteristic amide group absorptions at 3360 cm
-1
 
(N-H stretching), 1581 and 1634 cm
-1
 (NH bending, amide II band). All the nanocomposites have the 
characteristic absorption peaks of Si-O-Si.  The band of Si-O-Si bending vibration at 450 cm
-1
 increased with

3.2 Effect of various coupling agents 
We began our study by investigating the effect of several coupling agents on the property of prepared 
nanocomposites. As shown in Fig. 3, the nanocomposites prepared via coupling agent VTES demonstrated 
better mechanical property (stress-strain) than those made by other coupling agents. Since there was no 
significant difference in the thermal properties among various coupling agents, we selected VTES as the 
coupling agent for this study.

3.4 Thermal properties of PLA nanocomposites 
Chemical structures affect the thermal properties of polymers [18]. In a previous study of ductile PLA, 
we found that MOI markedly improved the mechanical properties of PLA, but slightly reduced the thermal 
properties of PLA [16]. For the thermal decomposition of PLA materials, the thermal decomposition 
temperatures at 10% weight loss (Td, 10%) decreased slightly from 357
o
C (PLA) to 342°C for PLA modified 
with 10% MOI. The thermal properties of prepared PLA nanocomposites are tabulated in Table 3. Fig. 5 
depicts TGA curves of the PLA nanocomposites. The Td,10% in nitrogen increased gradually with increasing 
silica content. The enhanced thermal stability of hybrids was due to the formation of polymer networks and 
inorganic moieties [19]. The TGA data demonstrated higher thermal stability of nanocomposites than pristine 
PLA. The thermal data also showed that the melting temperatures (Tm) of hybrids increased gradually with 
increasing silica content. This increase can be attributed to the strong interaction between the organic polymer 
matrix and the inorganic silica that increased the restricting strength of silica on PLA molecules [20]. This 
trend is also reflected in the crystallinity. The percent crystallinity (Xc) is determined using the ratio of 
measured enthalpy of melting PLA hybrids and 87 J/g, the enthalpy of melting of pure PLLA (poly-L-lactide) 
crystal [21]. Our results clearly demonstrate that synthesized PLA nanocomposites provide improvements in 
thermal as well as mechanical properties.

The morphology of the fractured surfaces (from stress-strain tests) was elucidated by SEM to 
investigate the microstructure of PLA hybrids. The SEM images in Fig. 7a-b compared the fractured surface 
of hybrid PNB with 7.5% silica content to pristine PLA. In Fig. 7a, pristine PLA showed a smooth and dense 
morphology. Minor cracks were observed, as a result of cutting brittle PLA. The morphology of the fractured 
surfaces of MOI-modified PLA hybrid changed substantially. Instead of a roughened surface, the cut surface 
of the modified materials showed no cracks and exhibited a finely interconnected structure or co-continuous 
phase. Fig. 7b showed the cross section of hybrid PNB. The silicas were found to be dispersed 
homogeneously in polymer matrix at 30,000 magnifications (scale bar 100 nm). The microstructure is another 
indication that prepared PLA nanocomposites are ductile materials.

From the TEM of hybrid PNB, one can see that the silica particles distributed evenly in PLA matrix 
and the particle sizes within the hybrid films is ＜100 nm (Fig. 8); this indicates that PLA nanocomposites 
can be successfully made by our sol-gel process.

4. Conclusions 
Novel synthesized MOI-modified PLA nanocomposites demonstrated markedly improved mechanical 
and thermal properties. The formation of poly(ester-urethane) structure between the terminal hydroxyl groups 
of PLA and the NCO end of MOI result an improvement of PLA mechanical properties. The introduction of 
silica via the sol-gel process also increased the thermal stability of PLA. The 10% thermal decomposition 
temperature for PLA nanocomposite with 7.5% silica was 360°C, which was 32°C higher than that of pristine 
PLA. Further studies will investigate the biocompatibility of the modified PLA nanocomposites under 
physiological conditions to evaluate the use of hybrid materials in biomedical applications.
