摘要
本研究主要探討「有效迴轉半徑(Effective Radius of Gyration)」之觀念運用
於鋼骨鋼筋混凝土(Steel Reinforced Concrete，SRC)柱設計之可行性與學理上之合
理性，並將該法之設計結果與SRC柱實驗結果比較以檢驗其準確性與可靠度。
對SRC柱而言，由於SRC柱內部之鋼骨受到混凝土的包覆，使得鋼骨抵抗整
體挫屈的能力大幅提升，同時也降低鋼骨發生局部挫屈的可能性。雖然這種有利
的因素已被學術界與工程界適度認知，不過長期以來，美國ACI-318 code、
AISC-LRFD specification 與日本AIJ-SRC code等先進國家的設計規範對於SRC柱
之迴轉半徑各自採取不同的計算方式，使其所計得之SRC柱的長細比亦不相同，
最終導致了不同的設計規範對於SRC柱之軸壓強度的預估值產生明顯的差異。
為了釐清此一SRC柱設計上的重要問題，本研究採用一種稱為「有效迴轉半
徑」的觀念來評估SRC柱的抗壓強度，並考慮混凝土開裂及材料非線性所造成的
影響。本研究並結合相對剛度與強度疊加之觀念，發展出一套新的SRC柱設計方
法以提供學術界與工程界參考。
31. INTRODUCTION
In the United States, the design provisions for the SRC columns can be found in the ACI
(American Concrete Institute) building code and the AISC (American Institute of Steel
Construction) design specification. As the design methodologies for the SRC columns are
concerned, the ACI-318 code treats the steel section as an equivalent amount of reinforcement
so that the SRC column is designed as a reinforced concrete (RC) column. On the contrary, in
the AISC-LRFD specification, the design procedure of a SRC column is firstly performed by
transforming the RC into an equivalent amount of steel section. Then, the SRC column is
designed using the equations developed for the steel columns. Considering the
above-mentioned design methods, it is observed that the direct application of the equations
originally developed for the RC columns or for the steel columns may not be appropriate for
the design of SRC columns. For instance, the nominal strength of a SRC column specified in
the ACI code neglects the influence of residual stresses in the steel section.
In Japan, the concept of “simple superposition method (SSM)” for SRC column design
was adopted in the AIJ (Architecture Institute of Japan) SRC code. The strength of a SRC
column can be easily determined through superposition of the strengths of the steel and the RC
portions of the SRC column. The bond effect between the steel and the concrete is
conservatively neglected in the SSM.
It is known that the buckling strength of the steel section encased in the SRC column is
enhanced by the reinforced concrete. However, it is noted that different approaches are used in
the ACI code and the AISC specification to account for this beneficial effect by using different
equations to calculate the radius of gyration of the SRC column. As a result, the calculated
slenderness ratios of the SRC columns are different, and the predicted column strengths the
ACI code and the AISC specification may show significant discrepancy.
In order to clarify the above-stated discrepancy among the major building codes as well as
to evaluate the SRC column strength more rationally, this study proposes a new design method
with a parameter caled “efective radius of gyration” to predict the SRC column strengths. In 
this study, the proposed new approach also takes into account the relative rigidity ratio (RRR)
of the steel portion and the RC portion in a SRC column to calculate the external loads shared
by each of the participating materials. It is also observed that by adopting the concept of
strength superposition, we will be able to combine the ACI specification and the AISC code to
create an alternative new approach for the design of SRC columns. Recent studies by Weng et

For a SRC column symmetrical about the plane of bending, the interaction of the

where Pu = factored axial load; Mu = factored moment; Pn = nominal axial compressive

Based on the assumption of plastic stress distribution on the composite section, the
commentary of section I4 of the AISC-LRFD specification provides an equation to determine
the pure bending capacity for a doubly symmetric composite section. That is

β= reduction coefficient; Is = moment of inertia of steel portion; (EI)rc = flexural rigidity of RC
portion. (EI)rc is conservatively taken as (EcIg)/5 according to the ACI-318 code.
The reduction coefficient β in equations (13) and (14) is to account for the nonlinear
behavior of concrete. It is known that the normal weight concrete behaves nearly linearly up to
about 0.5fc’. The elastic relationship does not be hold beyond this stress level. Thus a reduction
coefficientβis introduced to account for the nonlinear behavior of concrete under large axial
load. The secant modulus of the concrete, (Ec)sec , is found from

In this study, an average β value of 0.55 is adopted to approximately account for the
nonlinear behavior of concrete under large axial load.
9specification, an equation based on the plastic stress distribution in the composite section is
suggested for calculating the value of (M0)comp. In order to simplify the design procedure, this
equation is adopted in the current study to calculate the flexural capacity of the SRC structural
member subjected to pure bending.
In order to evaluate the SRC column behavior more rationally, this study uses a new term
called the effective radius of gyration, reff , to predict the SRC column strengths.

The ratios listed in column (9) of Table 2 are the predicted strength-to-tested strength
ratios of the moment capacities, Mprop / Mfiber. As shown in the table, the maximum and
minimum ratios of Mprop / Mfiber, are 1.14 and 0.85, respectively. In addition, the average value
of the strength ratio is 0.99, with coefficient of variation (COV) of 10%.
5.2 Comparative Results between Proposed Method and Test Results
Listed in column (10) of Table 2 are the predicted strength-to-tested strength ratios of the
moment capacities, Mprop / Mtest, for the SRC columns tested under combined axial load and
bending moment. As shown in the table, the range of the predicted- to-tested ratios is from
0.76 to 1.10. Most of the strength ratios are between 0.85 and 1.05. The average value of the
ratio is 0.93 with COV of 11%.
In addition, the P-M interaction diagrams calculated by using the proposed approach, the
ACI-318 code and the AISC-LRFD specification are plotted in Figs. 3 and 4 for some typical
specimens of M and N groups, respectively. In these figures, the star symbol represents the
tested strength of the SRC columns.
For the M-group, the P-M interaction diagram based on the proposed method is found to
be conservative in most cases as compared to the test results. The average ratio of predicted
strengths to test results is 0.91 with coefficient of variation of 12%. For the N-group, the P-M
interaction diagram based on the proposed method is slightly overestimated as compared to the
test results. The average ratio of predicted strengths to test results is 1.08 with coefficient of
variation of 2%.
The comparative results show that the proposed new design method gives satisfactory
prediction of the strengths of the SRC columns. In general, this study has developed a new
method to evaluate the strength of the SRC columns by using a parameter called the effective
radius of gyration. The new method also adopts the concept of strength superposition to sum up
the calculated strengths of the steel and the RC portions. In addition, the proposed method also
utilizes the “relative rigidity ratio” of the steel portion and the RC portion in the SRC column to 
calculate the loads shared by each of the participating materials.

spiral cages are common in today’s precast factory. It is because of the cost effectiveness and the lower demand
of skilled labors which make the spiral cages a potential competitor. However, applications of the circular
spirals to the rectangular cross-section RC and SRC columns are not common in today’s engineering practice
because the concrete at the four corners of the rectangular columns can not be effectively confined by the
circular spirals.

Fig. 2 Rectangular SRC columns confined with the double-spiral
As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the double-spiral confinements will effectively solve the problem of the unconfined
concrete at the four corners of rectangular RC and SRC columns. The concept of applying the double-spiral to
rectangular columns was first put forward in 2006 by Dr. Y. L. Yin, CEO of Ruentex Group. The double-spiral
is a device of two interconnected spirals including a circular spiral at the center and a star-shaped spiral
surrounding the perimeter of the rectangular column. The innovative configuration breaks through the
application restriction of the conventional spiral confinement to circular columns, overcomes the shortcomings
of spiral application to rectangular cross-sectional columns and facilitates sound confinement of spiral to
concrete at the corners of the rectangular column. Moreover, as the double-spiral can be manufactured with
automatic machines in the precast factory, they are expected to substantially reduce manpower in bonding of
conventional rectangular hoops and shorten the construction period.
The objective of this research is to investigate experimentally the efficiency of applying the double-spiral to the

During the test, a LVDT (linear variable differential transformer) extensometer was attached on the side of the
specimen to monitor the axial shortening. To measure the strains within the specimens, strain gages were glued
on the selected surfaces of the steel section and the reinforcing bars before casting the concrete.

if designed according to the ACI-318 Code. As compared to the reduction factor of 1.0 for the bench mark RC
column, RC2, the smallest reduction factor is 65% for SRC specimens SRC5 and SRC6. The weight of
confinement reinforcement per unit length of column used for specimens SRC5 and SRC6 are only 248 and 226
N/m, which is much more economical than that of 405 N/m for specimen RC2. These observations reveal that,
with a significant saving of 35% of the confinement steel, the double-spirally confined SRC columns can still
perform better, both in strength and ductility, than the traditional hoop-tied RC column.
