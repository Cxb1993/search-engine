The focus of this year’s research is combinatorial auction. We have completed the 
following works. 1. Constructing the details for hierarchical package bidding (abbreviated 
HPB) auction. And 2. Complete VCG auction design and computer bidding interface. We 
have conducted a total of 16 sessions of experiment, with 96 subjects participating in 201 
auctions. 
Suppose there are J goods for sale in an auction. In a combinatorial auction, bidder could 
choose to purchase any combination of the J goods, hence there is a total of  subsets 
to bid on. Combinatorial auction allows great degree of freedom in goods combination, but it 
also creates great difficulty in calculating the optimal allocation. The HPB auction designed 
by Goeree and Holt (2008) constructed a clever hierarchical structure for the packages which 
greatly reduces the complexity of the computation for the winning bids and prices. HPB was 
adopted by FCC in the 2009 700 MhZ auction. The first item we completed this year is 
constructing the complete details of multi round HPB auction, including winner determination 
rule and formula for calculating minimum effective bids.

The most important theoretical result of combinatorial auction is that under VCG 
mechanism, bidding the true valuation is a weakly dominant strategy and the resulting 
allocation is efficient. Even with this great theoretical advantage, but real world application of 
VCG is not very frequent, and it resulted in ridiculously low revenues in the New Zealand 
spectrum auction. Maybe due to computational difficulty, there are currently not very many 
experimental studies of VCG. For a 6 bidders 3 goods VCG auction, we have completed 
EXCEL programs to compute the revenue maximizing allocation and VCG prices, and also a 
simple computer interface for bidder to submit their bids. The controls in our experiment 
include different synergy effects, industry structures, auction format (VCG versus FPP), and 
valuation structures (PV versus CV). We have completed 201 auction experiments as of June 
3, 2010. The remaining months will be devoted to analyzing behavior data to examine 
subjects’ bidding behavior when facing multiple and overlapping items, and to check whether 
these behavioral record support theoretical predictions.

2. Guidelines for HPB procedure 
 
Suppose there are { }IB,...B,BI 21=  bidders competing for { }1 2, , , JG G G G= K goods 
in an auction. Let { }S,...2,1S =  be the set of all possible subset of , so . In a 
combinatorial auction, bidders could place bid on any one of the subsets. We begin with the 
simplest possible case, let  and the two goods are spectrum blocks A and C. So 
J 12 −= JS
2=J

1. The allocation in round (k-1) could be S or P, this would affect the calculation of 
hierarchical differences. 
 
2. For each item, Y denotes there are new bids and N no new bids in round k. There are three 
goods for sale and hence eight possible combinations. 
 New bids code description 
1 YYY New bids for all three items  
2 YYN New bids for A, C and no new bid for AC 
3 YNY New bids for A, AC and no new bid for C 
4 NYY New bids for C, AC and no new bid for A 
5 YNN New bid for A, and no new bids for C and AC 
6 NYN New bid for C, and no new bids for A and AC  
7 NNY New bid for AC, and no new bid for A and C 
8 NNN No bids for all three items  
 
3. The resulting allocation in round k could also be either S or P. 
 
Considering the above factors, there is a total of 2 × 8 × 2 ＝ 32 cases. A typical case 
could be represented by a five-letter code, the first letter refers to the allocation of round (k-1), 
the following three are new bids code, and the last one refers to the allocation result in round 
k. The following table lists the complete code of the 32 cases.

We have completed the HPB decision rule for all 32 cases. In the following, we report 
only one case in order to demonstrate the complicated details that HPB program must 
consider.

Note that in round (k-1), MEBA29+MEBC31=MEBAC60. This relationship would still 
hold in round k if we do not invoke the nonnegative D and non decreasing MEB constraint. 
Without these constraints, the minimum effective bid would be calculated as  
MEBA =HBA+0.5(PWBAC-HBA-OHBC)+I=40-1+2=41,  
MEBC=OHBC+0.5(PWBAC-HBA-OHBC)+I=24-1+2=25.  
And MEBA41+MEBC25=66, which is exactly the value of MEBAC. 
To compare the meaning of the constrained MEB and no constrain MEB, let us look into 
some possible new bids in round (k+1). Under the no constrain MEB, if the new bids in (k+1) 
round are as in Example 1, the result would be a P allocation.  
 
Example 1 new bids in round (k+1) 
 A C AC
1 40
2 
3 
4 26
5 70
6 
But the constrained MEB raises the MEB for singleton, and since effective HBC is 
higher, it means that the threshold for HBAC to be the provisional winner will be higher. So 
the same HBAC=70 in Example 2 would not be the winning bid.  
Example 2 new bids in round (k+1) 
 A C AC
1 40
2 
3 
4 31
5 70
6 
 
And if the new bids in round (k+1) are as in Example 3, HBAC=68> MEBAC=66 is an 
effective bid, and although HBAC=68<MEBA 40＋MEBC31=71, but HBAC>HBA+HBC, so 
HPB will still determine the goods to be sold in package AC.

packages by not entering any bids, hence the proportions of zero bids are higher when the 
number of available subsets are larger.  
Hypothesis 2: A direct implication of the above hypothesis is that the bidding functions 
 would be more nonlinear when subjects have more subsets to bid on.  ( )ii vb
Hypothesis 3: The bidding functions are significantly different for goods with positive 
and negative synergy. 
Hypothesis 4: Comparing with VCG, the bids are significantly lower under FPP auctions, 
but the revenues higher.  
Hypothesis 5: The bidding function ( )ii vb  is different for PV, CV easy and CV hard 
environment. Bidders downward adjust their bids when the level of uncertainty is higher.  
Hypothesis 6: We also employed a domain-specific risk-attitude scale and expect that 
subjects with higher risk attitudes scale would bid more aggressively in the auction.

To bid or not to bid: 
  
An experimental study of bidding behavior in VCG auction 
 
 
By Chinn-Ping Fan*, Bih-Shiow Chen and Hung-Han Lin 
Department of Economics, Soochow University, Taipei, Taiwan 
 
Paper presented at the 2010 North-American ESA Conference 
November 11-13, Tucson, Arizona, USA 
 
VCG mechanism is one good example demonstrating that there are sometimes gaps between 
theories and the real world. As the title of one paper amply calls it, VCG seems to be a lovely but 
lonely mechanism. Theoretical analysis predicts that people under VCG could bid their true 
valuation, and the outcomes are efficient. However, VCG application in the real world is very 
limited, and it may result in collusion and unreasonably low revenues, as the experience of the New 
Zealand spectrum auction demonstrated.  
We design combinatorial auction with six bidders and three goods. Our experiments have 
three controls: the auction rule may be VCG or first price package (FPP); the three goods could be 
compliments or substitute and finally, we want to observe how subject behavior changes when they 
have more packages to bid on. Seven packages could be constructed from the three goods. In some 
of the auctions, the private values are designed so that bidders are interested in purchasing all seven 
packages. And in others, bidders are interested in purchasing only three, or one of the packages. We 
come to the following conclusions. 
1. Comparing with FPP, the revenues are lower under VCG and bidders receive higher payoffs, 
but VCG does not lead to higher efficiency.   
2. When facing all seven packages, 14 percents of all the bids are left blank, and this no-bid ratio 
drops significantly when the number of interested package decreases.  
3. The bidding function is estimated with a truncated model, i.e., eliminating all no-bid 
observations. We find that subjects’ bids are very close to their true valuations, for both VCG 
and FPP.

Table 1 Bidder valuation for N7 treatment 
Package A B C AB AC BC ABC 
Commercial value 10 5 10 18 25 16 39 
Bid        
In the N3 treatment, each bidder has positive values for two singletons and one dual 
packages. Subjects B1 and B2  have positive PV for packages A, B, and AB; B3 and, B4 for A, 
C, and AC; and finally, B5 and B6 for B, C, and BC. With this design, each singleton has four 
bidders and dual package two bidders. This design was not revealed to the bidders, they were 
only told that the valuation structure of each bidder may be different. Table 2 is an example of 
what the bidding screen looks like. Subjects were instructed that the zeros mean that those 
packages had no commercial values, so paying positive prices for them would surely lead to 
losses.  
Table 2 Example of Bidder valuation and bid for N=3 
Package A B C AB AC BC ABC 
Commercial value 10 5 0 18 0 0 0 
Bid        
And in the N1 treatment, three bidders are interested in purchasing one singleton each. 
Subjects B1 has positive PV for singleton A, B2, for B; and B3 for C. The other three bidders are 
interested only in purchasing the grand package. Again, each bidder sees only her/his own 
valuation but not knowing the complete valuation structure of all bidders. 
3. The goods may have positive or negative synergy. Positive synergy means the value 
functions are super-additive,      kjikiji ssvsvsv      for all i. It also means that the 
goods are compliments. The PVs of singletons are randomly drawn from the interval [20, 40]. 
The PVs of a dual package is the sum of singleton PV plus a complimentary factor randomly 
drawn from the interval [0, 8]. To ensure the super-additive property, the PV of the grand 
package is the maximal of sum of dual PV plus singleton PV. Following these rules, sixteen 
sets of random PV are drawn and tested for the N7 treatment, twelve sets for N3 and another 
twelve sets for N1. 
Negative synergy means the value functions are sub-additive, for example, 
     kjikiji ssvsvsv     , and the goods are partially substitutes. The range of singleton 
PVs are the same as above, and the PV of a dual package is the sum of singleton PV minus a 
Hypothesis 3: For bidders, the degree of cognitive difficulty increases with a larger N, and 
hence, the proportion of no bidding also increases with N.  
Hypothesis 4: The bidding functions are significantly different for goods with positive and 
negative synergy.  
Hypothesis 5: The risk attitude scale is related with subjects’ bidding behavior, subjects with 
higher risk attitudes scale would bid more aggressively in the auction. 
 
 
3. Results 
 
We first compare the performance of VCG and FPP in the following three respects. With it’s 
complex computation rules, VCG has the elegant theoretical result that subject would bid truthfully 
and the resulting allocation is efficient. Efficiency is maybe the most important target in an suction, 
so we first look at the efficiency result.  
To maximize efficiency, the goods should be allocated to the bidders so that total surplus is 
maximized, this optimal total surplus is expressed as , and the actual surplus achieved in an 
auction is denoted as . The efficiency ratio, 
maxS
actualS %S
SER 
max
actual 100 , calculates the percentage 
of total surplus that is actually achieved in an auction. ER = 100% denotes an efficient allocation 
has been achieved.

After these initial investigations, we should now study subjects bidding behavior. We first 
examine the scatter diagrams to look at the general picture. It appears that most of the dots do 
gather around the 45 degree truthful bidding line. But we also notice that a significant proportion of 
the dots lay in the horizontal axis. These dots do not mean that subjects submit a bid of zero, bur 
rather, these were the bids that are left blank. And we will describe these as the no-bid behavior.

bidding prediction in three out of the five treatments, and they over-bid in the other two treatments. 
The last column of Table 6 reports the NB proportion. For example, for the N7C treatment, there 
should be 672 observations, but 73 were NB, so after truncation, we only have 599 observation. So 
for this treatment, 11% (73/672) of the bids were NB. This column clearly shows that NB ratios 
decreases with N.

Recall that there are now no theoretical predictions for heterogeneous goods first price 
combinatorial auction. But Table 7 shows that subject behavior in FPP auctions demonstrate truthful 
bidding in all five treatments. The difference between VCG and FPP is that subjects in general do 
not over-bid under FPP. Note that the regression shows truthful bidding to be the general behavior 
pattern, but there are still individual subjects who over-bid, and these are the ones that most likely 
winning, and hence, winners’ curse. The last column of Table 7 also shows that NB ratios decreases 
with N.  
Table 8 summerizes the relationship between NB ratio and the number of available packages. 
The last row shows that 1.39% of the bids were left blank in the N1 treatment. Since each subject 
faces more items in the N3 and N7 treatment, it is reasonable to expect that there would be more 
NB in the latter two cases. If independent of total number of packages, the NB ratio is 1.39% for 
each package, we would expect that in N3 treatment, the NB ratio should be 1.39%=4.17%, this 
expected NB ratio is shown in the third column. But the actual NB ratio is 5.67%, which is 26.46%

short term memory could not accommodate too many items, and the general limit is seven plus or 
minus two. That is there individual differences of the limits, and it varies from five to nine items. 
Our treatment N7 contains the magical number seven, while it is not possible for our subjets to 
place more than seven bids, if there is a limit on subjects cognition ability, it is possible that they 
simply ignore some of the items and choose not to enter bids. We suspect that the NB behavior we 
observe is related this cognition limitation. It is difficult to test this hypothesis directly, so we adopt 
an indirect approach. We classified all the auctions into two categories: NB auctions are the ones 
with some blank bids, and B auctions have no blank bids. We than run truncated regression for NB 
and B auctions, if the results of the two regression are very similar, than the bidding pattern of the 
NB and B auction are similar, this could strength our claim that cognition limitation could be one 
reason for the NB behavior. 
Table 10 Truncated regression of NB and B auctions  
Treatment   p-value AIC No of Obs. No. of  Truncated Obs NB% 
VCG- B auction 0.978 0.000*** 6.575 1404 1404  0.00 
VCG- NB auction 0.954 0.000*** 6.522 444 288 35.14 
FPP- B auction 0.947 0.000*** 6.227 1258 1258  0.00 
FPP- NB auction 0.940 0.000*** 6.487 590 308 47.80 
 
Table 10 reports the truncated regression for the NB and B auctions, all the   parameters are 
significant, and we cant not reject the hypothesis that subject bid truthfully. We have also tested for 
the difference in parameters of B and NB auctions and found that the differences are insignificant.  
Following Webk er (2002), we also ask subjects to complete a domain specific risk scale as 
shown in Talbe 11. The fifteen questions could be classified into five risk dimensions: financial (Q1, 
Q2, Q5, Q7, Q8, Q9, Q10, Q11, Q13), recreation (Q3, Q6, Q15), health (Q14), moral (Q4), and 
social (Q12). 
In order to connect subjects risk scale and his bidding behavior, we first want to control the 
effect of various treatment factors. So we use Tobit panel data fixed effect model to analyze our data.

Table 13 report the truncated regression for  in VCG auction . The parameters of financial 
risk scale is negative, implying more risk avers subject would submit lower bids, this is as expected. 
And most of the other scales are not significant, which implies that the other risk dimensions are not 
much related to the magnitudes of the bids.
