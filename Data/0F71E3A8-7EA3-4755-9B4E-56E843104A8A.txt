I.中文摘要  
由於抗生素及其他藥物的廣泛及大量地使用，故其於承受水體之流佈及宿命已逐漸受到注
意，且大多數之抗生素會改變微生物族群結構及導致抗藥性致病菌之產生。本研究為台灣地區
第一次研究藥物於水體環境之流佈及宿命調查，主要之研究目標為了解抗生素，以及使用較頻
繁/較常被偵測到之藥物。由研究結果得知，大部份藥物於地表水中所偵測到之濃度範圍為
0.49-75100 ng/L 之間。 
本研究另利用批次實驗方式進行光解實驗，其結果指出，目標抗生素均會透過直接或間接
光解作用降解。於直接光解方面(於去離子水)，cephalexin 及 cephradine 之直接光解速率較慢(半
衰期約為 20 小時)，而其他目標抗生素之直接光解速率較快(半衰期約為幾分鐘至 4 小時)。於
間接光解方面，於僅添加硝酸鹽溶液中其半衰期約為 0.7-10.6 小時，而於僅添加溶解性有機碳
溶液中其半衰期約為 1.1-6.6 小時。由上述結果可知，目標抗生素於自然水體中具有快速光解

III. Literature Review 
 
Occurrence of antibiotics and pharmaceuticals in the environment 
The appearance of antibiotics and pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment was first 
observed as long as three decades ago [1], but only in this decade has their presence raised 
significant concern because of their widespread occurrence, potential toxicity for aqueous 
environments, and risk to human health. Even though the concentrations released are generally low 
(in the range of ng/L to μg/L), their potential impact on human health cannot be overlooked, 
particularly for those commonly used substances that may accumulate in human tissues [2]. Previous 
investigators have demonstrated concrete negative effects, including reduced sperm counts in adult 
male guppies [3] and development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains [4]. The synthetic estrogen 
17alpha-ethynylestradiol has been found to affect reproductive cycles in fish even at 4 ng/L 
concentrations [5]. The sources and pathways of pharmaceuticals into the environment are well 
understood [6, 7]. Pharmaceuticals consumed by humans may undergo biochemical modifications 
during hepatic or enteric metabolism before excretion in urine or feces [8] and eventual arrival into 
the aquatic environment. Direct release via household toilet flushing is another non-negligible route 
of drug disposal. Trace levels of pharmaceuticals, antibiotics and their metabolites are ubiquitous 
and have been found in sources as diverse as drinking water, sewage treatment plant effluents, and 
even surface water [9-12]. Several studies have reported that the low removal efficiency of 
pharmaceuticals in conventional treatment processes inevitably results in their release into aqueous 
environments [13, 14]. Others have found sulfamethoxazole concentrations of 390 ng/L in influent 
samples and minimal elimination in effluents (310 ng/L) [15], and little pharmaceutical degradation 
in pre-treatment or in sedimentation treatment processes that are specific for acidic, low Kow 
compounds such as pharmaceuticals [16]. 
Waste streams and effluents from hospitals, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and 
livestock are major sources of contaminating pharmaceuticals, which have been found in high 
concentrations [15, 17-24]. Gomez et al. [20] showed that residues of 12 human-use medicines 
(including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antibiotics, and beta-blockers) appeared 
in hospital waste effluents at concentrations up to 151 μg/L. In Oslo, Norway, Thomas et al. [23] 
found high concentrations (up to 1368 μg/L) of NSAIDs and antibiotics in effluents from two 
hospitals. In addition, a study of seven WWTPs found that they created aquatic “hot spots” of 
contamination with human-use pharmaceuticals in concentrations ranging from the high ng/L to low 
μg/L, with progressive dilution in their receiving rivers [21]. Xu et al. [24] reported incomplete 
elimination of selected antibiotics at the four sewage treatment plants studied and concentrations

IV. Method and Materials 
 
Chemicals and standards 
LC grade methanol and disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA-2Na) (ACS grade) were 
purchased from Mallinckrodt Baker (Phillipsburg, PA, USA). ACS grade formic acid, estrone, and 
17α-ethinylestradiolwere obtained from Riedel-deHaën (Seelze, Germany). Sulfuric acid, cefazolin 
sodium salt, cephapirin sodium, cefotaxime sodium salt and penicillin G sodium salt were purchased 
from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Propranolol and diclofenac sodium salt were purchased from USP 
(Rockville, MD, USA). Potassium nitrate was obtained from Ishizu pharmaceutical Co. Ltd (Osaka, 
Japan). Sodium Hydroxide was obtained from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Twenty other target 
compounds (Table 1) and humic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). 
Phenyl-13C6-sulfamethazine solution (1 g/L in methanol) was purchased from Cambridge Isotope 
Laboratories (Andover, MA, USA). Nitrogen gas of 99.9% purity was purchased from Shinn Hwa 
gas company (Taipei, Taiwan). Erythromycin-H2O, a major degradation product of erythromycin, 
was not commercially available and was synthesized by acidification of erythromycin using the 
method described by McArdell et al. [13] with modifications (pH of the erythromycin solution was 
adjusted to 2.0). Individual stock standard solutionswere prepared on a weight basis in methanol. 
These solutions were stored in amber glass bottles at −20°C for a maximum of 15 days. Standard 
mixtures at different concentrations were prepared by appropriate dilution of the stock solutions 
before each analytical run.  
 
Sample collection and preparation 
Grab samples (1 L) were collected from each site in amber glass bottles and stored in 
ice-packed coolers. Each site was sampled 2 or 3 times for a more “composite” view of the site. 
Replicate surface water samples were taken within one day, while replicate water samples from 
pharmaceuticals and drug production facilities were taken within one month. Two milli-liters of 
0.125 M EDTA-2Na were added to the bottles before collection of samples meant for analysis for 
antibiotics. All water samples were vacuum-filtered through 0.45 μm and 0.22 μm cellulose acetate 
membrane filters (Advantec, Toyo Roshi Kaisha. Ltd., Japan) and stored at 4°C until analysis. Oasis 
HLB cartridges (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) with 500 mg 6 mL hydrophiliclipophilic balance were 
employed for solid phase extraction (SPE), using sample volumes of 250 mL. Different classes of 
pharmaceuticals were extracted with the following two SPE methods: 
Method 1 (for extraction of antibiotics):  
SPE cartridges were preconditioned with 6 mL of methanol and 6 mL of deionized (DI) water. 
 5 
were done in negative mode. Ions were acquired in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) modes with 
a dwell time of 50 ms and unit mass resolution on both mass analyzers. After selecting the precursor 
ions, product ions were obtained and optimized with four key parameters: declustering potential, 
entrance potential, collision energy, and collision cell exit potential. Detailed LC–ESI tandem-MS 
conditions for target compounds by MRM are listed in Table 3. 
 
Photodegradation experiments 
The individual standards of cephalosporin antibiotics in DI water (20 μg/L) were placed in 
capped quartz glass reaction tubes (1.6 cm i.d.×13.5 cm depth, volume=27 mL) exposed to a sunlight 
simulator (Suntest CPS1; Atlas, Chicago, IL, USA) with a 1.1 kW xenon (Xe) arc lamp. The suprax 
filter was fitted to remove UV wavelength transmission below 290 nm (total passing wavelength, 
290 nm-800 nm). Irradiation intensity was set at maximum 765 W/m2 for all batch experiments. 
Temperature in water bath was maintained at 20 °C by using a thermostat. Dark control solutions at 
the same concentrations were kept in darkness. The pH of solutions in DI water was adjusted to 7.0 
using sodium hydroxide. The synthetic waters were prepared by humic acid ([DOC]=10 mg/L) and 
potassium nitrate ([NO3−-N]=1 mg/L). UV-visible absorption spectrums of five target compounds 
were obtained using a UV- visible spectrophotometer (GBC Cintra 20, Australia).  
 
Sorption and biodegradation experiments 
Sorption and combined sorption-biodegradation experiments were conducted in triplicate in 
three separate experimental bottles. The first set of experiments (intended to investigate sorption 
uptake) consisted of 500 mL autoclaved DI water and 100 g autoclaved sediments spiked with 50 
μg/L of the target compounds. Sterile and neutral conditions (pH = 7) during the experiment were 
maintained by adding 0.1 mL 0.02% sodium azide and 1 mL 0.5 M phosphate buffer to each bottle. 
The second set of experiments (intended to investigate the effect of combined 
sorption-biodegradation) included 500 mL filtered (0.45 um) river water and 100 g sediments spiked 
with 50 μg/L of pharmaceuticals. One milliliter of 0.5 M phosphate buffer was added to maintain 
neutral conditions. The third set served as a control and contained 500 mL autoclaved DI water and 
spiked target compounds. Amber glass bottles were utilized to prevent photodegradation. All glass 
stoppered bottles were then shaken (120 rpm) in a shaker bath in an incubator set at a constant 
temperature (20◦C). The sorption experiments were continued until target compounds equilibrated. 
For the combined sorption-biodegradation experiments, the same bottles were spiked and respiked 
two more times with 50 μg/L concentration of target compound.

Other pharmaceuticals 
In 2004, the National Health Institute prescribed 578,873,456 doses of acetaminophen (500 mg, 
24 mg /mL), making it the number one drug prescribed in Taiwan that year. In this study, 
acetaminophen (ACT) was also the most often detected compound, present in all samples (except 
site C1) and found in high concentrations in surface waters (up to 3350, 15700 and 85 ng/L in the 
Sindian, Dahan and Gaoping Rivers). Others such as DIC, IBU, and NAP were also present in more 
than 60% of the samples at significant concentrations. The absence of KET in all the surface waters 
may have been due to its extremely photolabile nature; Lin and Reinhard [32] reported that the 
photolysis half-life of KET in natural water systems is only a few minutes. Gemfibrozil (GEM, a 
lipid regulator) and propranolol (PRP, a β-blocker), also top human-use medicines, were frequently 
detected in the Sindian and Dahan Rivers (up to 122 and 17 ng/L). 
Estrogens (E1, E2, and EE2) were mostly absent from surface water data except in samples 
from site B2, where E1 (up to 61 ng/L) and E2 (119 ng/L) were found. Concentrations observed in 
this study were higher than those reported by others. Kuch and Ballschmiter [33] detected the same 
estrogens in German river water, although in much lower concentrations (0.1-5.1 ng/L). It should be 
noted that previous investigators have reported the biotransformation of E2 to E1 [34]. Lin and 
Reinhard [32] also reported that 80% of E2 was biotransformed to E1 in <20 min, while E1, E2, and 
EE2 were photodegraded in natural river water with a half-life of 2-2.3 hr. Considering the natural 
attenuation mechanisms occurring in the river, the significant amount of estrogens detected in 
Taiwanese surface water warrants further investigation. 
In order to access the natural attenuation of pharmaceuticals on the rivers, the distribution of 
four particular pharmaceuticals (acetaminophen, caffeine, propranolol and acebutolol) were surveyed 
and found in each of the four sampling sites in Jilung River in Table 4d. Pharmaceutical 
concentrations in the river water were at ng/L to μg/L levels and were higher where wastewater 
treatment plant effluents were discharged (D2) and lower in downstream segments of the river. Since 
water samples were collected on sunny days, with no rainfall, river branches, or large pipes entering 
the river in the area studied, dilution seems unlikely. Although different degrees of attenuation were 
found for all four target compounds during the river transport, these data indicated that the possibility 
of loss during the aqueous phase through natural processes such as photodegradation, 
sorption/degradation were highly likely. Therefore, we later conducted batch studies of river water 
samples to investigate their potential for photodegradation, sorption and biodegradation and to 
characterize the fate of our target compounds in this aqueous environment.

form (pKa of 9.5-9.7) and possesses very low hydrophobicity (log Kow 0.46-0.49). These properties 
probably contribute to the low sorption rates observed in our study. According to the results, 
biodegradation is the primary natural attenuative mechanism responsible for acetaminophen 
breakdown. Fig. 3b presents results from studies of sorption uptake and combined 
sorption-biodegradation of caffeine. Concentrations in the control system were stable at all times; in 
contrast, caffeine levels in the two experimental systems were similar only for the first two days, 
after which the rate of breakdown by combined sorption biodegradation greatly exceeded the rate for 
sorption alone. The concentration of caffeine in the sorption-only system decreased by 76% within 
13 days and subsequently remained stable, while all of the caffeine in the combined 
sorption-biodegradation system was consumed by the fourth day (t1/2 = 1.5 days). Caffeine 
biodegradation has been documented in single culture [35, 36], mixed consortium [37] and in 
wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) that used biological treatment systems [38, 39]. We thus 
conclude that sorption and biodegradation are both significant mechanisms for caffeine removal in 
water systems. 
For propranolol and acebutolol (Fig. 3c and 3d), the effect of sorption alone was similar to that 
of combined sorption-biodegradation, indicating that the influence of biodegradation alone was 
almost negligible. The concentrations of propranolol and acebutolol were found to be decreased by 
83% and 90% respectively after 14 days, and their half-lives were 2.2 days (propranolol) and 2.4 
days (acebutolol). The micro-flora responsible for the biodegradation of these two compounds may 
have been absent in the pocket of sediment considered in this study. Results suggest that sorption is 
the dominant mechanism behind the loss of both propranolol and acebutolol. With the exception of 
acetaminophen, we found that consumption rates by sorption alone for our target compounds 
(caffeine, propranolol, and acebutolol) were higher than by combined sorption-biodegradation during 
the first few days. This may have been an artifact of the preparation process. Previous studies have 
shown that the rate of sorption is enhanced by pre-treatment methods such as autoclaving, drying, 
and exposure to chemicals (e.g., NaOH, CaCl2) [40], while Hildebrand et al. [41] showed that 
sorption of 1 beta-estradiol in autoclaved soil was slightly higher than in sodium azide or mercuric 
chloride-treated soil. However, an earlier study [42] reported otherwise and concluded that 
sterilization by autoclaving results in negligible change. Our samples were autoclaved, potentially 
changing sediment characteristics or altering sorption rates.  
Respike experiments were conducted to determine the potential of target compounds for 
biodegradation. The combined sorption-biodegradation systems were respiked on days 13 and 28. 
Results are presented in Fig. 4. For acetaminophen and caffeine (Fig. 4a and 4b), degradation was 
faster after the second respike, suggesting that significant adaptation of microbial flora and potential

Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have received considerable 
concern around the worlds due to their potential toxicity for ecosystem and human 
health. PPCPs are hardly removed by conventional wastewater treatment processes 
and thus widely occurred in aqueous environments. This study investigated the 
occurrence and removal of 28 often used PPCPs (including selected antibiotics, 
estrogens, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, beta-blockers, and lipid regulators) 
in the primary, secondary and tertiary (ultrafiltration/reverse osmosis, UF/RO) 
treatment processes of Water Resource Recycling Center (WRRC) and surface waters 
in Taiwan. Results showed that twenty target PPCPs were detected in WRRC 
influents; sulfamethoxazole (1353 ng/L), caffeine (6823 ng/L) and acetaminophen 
(2716 ng/L) were found with higher concentrations. Secondary and chlorination 
processes showed inefficient removal for PPCPs (twelve PPCPs had <80% removal). 
However, most target compounds were removed effectively (with ~90% removal) in 
the tertiary process (UF/RO), and the overall removal efficiency by WRRC is >99%. 
More than 10 compounds were detected in surveyed surface water (reservoirs, river 
waters and dams). Caffeine had the highest observed concentration (1,813 ng/L) while 
others were found to be <260 ng/L. Sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethazine, 
sulfadimethoxine and caffeine were detected most frequently (frequency of detection 
>70%). Parts of these observed PPCPs are originated from the discharge of 
conventional wastewater treatment plants. In conclusion, good overall performance of 
RO was observed and it could be used to process the wastewater to better ensure the 
health of humans and wildlife.
