Abstract 
Falls are the most significant cause of accidental death among older adults. Previous research has 
shown that stance balance control is affected in aging adults. However, current research field has 
been limited to the study of balance control in small set of joints; the effect of multi-joint 
coordination during stance is not known for this population. In light of results from research on 
stance balance control in older adults, one would predict that in this population, the ability to 
maintain stability in standing position would be greatly decreased under insufficient sensory 
feedback. Thus, an appropriate research tool is needed for studying the multi-joint coordination in 
control of center of mass (COM) position. This study examined the age-related changes in 
multi-joint coordination of controlling upright posture in different sensory inputs. The novel 
Uncontrolled Manifold (UCM) approach was used to examine the structure of joint variance related 
to the control of COM position. This model can partition the variance of the joint configuration 
combinations into two components, one that reflects the use of flexible combinations of joints to 
achieve a particular COM position and another which leads to variability of the COM position. To 
test the multi-joint coordination hypothesis, we compared the healthy young adults groups and the 
healthy older adults groups’ performance. The preliminary results suggest that both young and older 
adults move their COM position intensively when losing the sensory inputs. However, the flexible 
multi-joint coordination ability decreased in older adults due to aging. This study not only improves 
our understanding of multi-joint coordination of postural control in aging process, but also provides a 
basis for developing improved tools for evaluation and treatment of patients with balance disorders.

indicate that the nervous system takes advantage of the available motor abundance, allowing for 
flexible control of a variety of motor tasks (Latash 2000; Scholz et al. 2007). Indeed, in our previous 
results, we showed that the postural control system takes advantage of available joint abundance to 
control the COM position even during quiet standing. In fact, the joints typically described as 
primarily important for postural control, the ankle and hip, exhibited less variance over 5-min of 
standing than a number of other joints. Although it is tempting to suggest that this fact reflects 
greater control of the hip and ankle joints by the nervous system, the majority of variance of all 
seven joints examined was structured such that it stabilized the mean COM position, i.e. reflected 
goal-equivalent joint combinations, with very little of the variance leading to COM position 
variability. Such a result can only occur if all joints are coordinated with respect to controlling that 
position.  
 
When a standing person performs a movement such that the center of mass shifts, the activity of 
postural muscles adjusts to keep the balance. Upright human posture is inherently unstable due to the 
difficulty in maintaining the high center of mass within the relatively small base of support provided 
by the feet (Zatsiorsky 2002). In our daily life activities, quick arm movements, interactions with 
external objects, and voluntary whole-body actions all contribute to problems of stabilizing the 
vertical posture. In particular, voluntary body sway is associated with translation of the center of 
mass closer to the edge of support and large inertial forces, which threaten balance (Winter et al. 
1996; Woollacott and Shumway-Cook 2002; Duarte and Freitas 2005). Increased postural sway in 
patients with osteoporosis is well documented (Kuczynski and Ostrowska 2006), and research has 
linked greater amounts of postural sway to increased risk of falling. Therefore, it is important to 
understand the mechanism that causes increased posture sway in older adults. 
 
The Uncontrolled Manifold approach has been used in studying multi-joint coordination in recent 
motor control research (Scholz and Schöner 1999; Scholz et al. 2000; Krishnamoorthy et al. 2003; 
Krishnamoorthy et al. 2005; Hsu et al. 2007). The UCM approach can relate individual joint 
contributions to the control of COM. The UCM hypothesis assumes that the controller (the central 
nervous system) acts in a state space of independent elemental variables. They are the smallest 
sensible variables that describe the system at a selected level of analysis. Hypothetically, the 
controller can change these variables independently of each other. In different studies, elemental 
variables have been associated with axes of joint movement (Scholz and Schöner 1999; Domkin et al. 
2005; Freitas et al. 2006; Hsu et al. 2007), finger forces and moments of forces (Latash et al. 2002; 
Scholz et al. 2003; Kang et al. 2004; Shinohara et al. 2004; Shim et al. 2008), hypothetical 
commands to fingers (Latash et al. 2001), and hypothetical commands to muscle groups 
(Krishnamoorthy et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2006; Robert et al. 2008). In this study, we investigated 
how individual joint movement related to the COM control between older adults and young adults.

Results and Discussion 
Variance of Center of mass position 
Figures2 illustrate the fluctuations of the COMAP position for all subjects. The variance of the CMAP 
position was larger in YH group than in OH group (F1,26=14.39, p=0.001), larger in the EC condition 
than in the EO condition (F1,26=26.47, 
p<0.001) , and generally larger in the 
block condition than in the ground 
condition (F1,26=12.56, p<0.01). The 
results suggest that the subjects were 
unstable when losing both vision and 
proprioception information.

The structure of joint configuration variance related to the COM stability 
VUCM was significantly higher than VORT for all conditions (F1,26=47.27, p<0.001; Figure3).The 
UCM results also showed the main effects on age (F1,26=11.72, p<0.01), vision (F1,26=9.18, p<0.01) 
and surface (F1,26=5.061, p<0.05). In the ECB condition, the VUCM was significantly higher in YH 
than in OH while the VORT did not increased that much. The results suggest that older people loss the 
flexibility of control the COM when the vision and proprioception feedback were insufficient.
