Molecular Dynamics Analysis of the Instability for a
Nano-Scale Liquid Thread
Chun-Lang Yeh1
Abstract: This paper investigates the instability of a liquid thread by molecular
dynamics (MD) simulation. The influences of liquid thread radius, fundamental
cell length, and temperature are discussed. Snapshots of molecules, number of liq-
uid particles formed, and density field are analyzed. Two linear stability criteria,
namely Rayleigh’s stability criterion and Kim’s stability criterion, are accessed for
their validity in molecular scale. It is found that a liquid thread is more unstable
and produces more liquid particles in the fundamental cell when it is thinner or
at a higher temperature. In addition, a liquid thread with a longer fundamental
cell length is also more unstable and produces more liquid particles in the funda-
mental cell, but it evaporates slower. The trends of linear stability theories agree
with MD simulation results. However, Rayleigh’s stability criterion overpredicts
stable domain as compared to the MD simulation results. Kim’s stability criterion
gives more accurate predictions but overpredicts the stable domain at a higher tem-
perature. Finally, a liquid thread with a higher time averaged density uniformity
factor, fρ , is more unstable and produces more liquid particles in the fundamental
cell.

Molecular Dynamics Analysis of the Instability for a Nano-Scale Liquid Thread 255
To establish a nano-scale system is still a complex task because of the major chal-
lenges for fabricating the nano-locating and nano-driving assemblies. On the other
hand, molecular dynamics (MD) can offer novel insights into the underlying atom-
istic mechanisms and nano-scale behavior due to their high temporal and spatial
resolution. Liu and Tsai (2009)proposed a numerical method for extracting the
thermo-mechanical properties of a thin-film. In their study, MD simulations were
utilized to establish the load-displacement response of a thin copper substrate.
Nair, Farkas, and Kriz (2008)studied the indentation response of Ni thin films of
thicknesses in the nano-scale using MD simulations with embedded atom method
(EAM) inter-atomic potentials. Their simulation results showed that the contact
stress necessary to emit the first dislocation under the indenter is nearly indepen-
dent of film thickness and that in the elastic regime, the loading curves observed
start deviating from the Hertzian predictions for indentation depths greater than
2.5% of the film thickness. Namilae, Chandra, Srinivasan and Chandra (2007)used
parallel MD simulations to understand the mechanical behavior of interfaces in car-
bon nano-tubes (CNTs)based composites. It is shown that interface strength based
on non bonded interactions is very low (of the order of few MPa) and it can be sig-
nificantly improved through surface chemical modification of CNTs (to an order of
a few GPa). It is further noted that chemical bonding between functionalized nano-
tube and matrix during processing is essential to obtain good interface strength and
hence a better composite. Tang and Advani (2007)performed non-equilibrium MD
simulations to investigate water flow around a single-walled CNT. It was shown
that classical continuum mechanics does not hold when the drag forces on the
nano-tube are considered. Later, they (2008)proposed a method for studying nano-
tube dynamics in simple shear flow. In their method, the forces on the nano-tube
were obtained by MD simulations. The viscosity of dilute nano-tube suspensions
was calculated based on the nano-tube dynamics and the effects of the aspect ra-
tio and initial curvature of the nano-tube on suspension viscosity were explored
and discussed. Chen, Cheng and Hsu (2007)evaluated the fundamental mechani-
cal properties of single/multi-walled CNTs using MD simulations. The force field
between two carbon atoms is modeled with the Tersoff-Brenner potential while the
inlayer/interlayer van der Waals (vdW) atomistic interactions are simulated with the
Lennard-Jones potential. They found that the effect of the inlayer vdW atomistic
interactions can not be neglected and should receive attention in the MD simula-
tions of the mechanical properties of CNTs. Matsumoto, Nakagaki, Nakatani and
Kitagawa (2005)studied the internal structure-changes around the crack tip and the
pertinent crack growth behavior in an amorphous metal by MD simulation. The
Finnis-Sinclair potential for α-iron was used to describe the inter-atomic potential.
Computed results showed that nano-scale crystalline phase grows around the crack
tip and that the distribution of deformation zones and deformation mechanism are

2 Molecular Dynamics Simulation Method
In this study, the vaporization process of a liquid thread is investigated by MD
simulation. The inter-atomic potential is one of the most important parts of MD
simulation. Many possible potential models exist, such as hard sphere, soft sphere,
square well, etc [Haile (1992)]. In this research, the Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential
model, which is widely used, is adopted for calculation. It is

coalesce into one liquid particle. The number of liquid particles at t*=1000 for
L∗=240 and 480 is 3 and 5, respectively.
WhenR∗=3, the liquid thread breaks up into drops for all fundamental cell lengths
except L∗=10 for which the liquid thread remains intact. For L∗=16, 20, 30, 60 and
120, the liquid thread ruptures merely from its two ends and only one liquid particle
is formed. For L∗=240 and 480, the thread ruptures not only from the top and bot-
tom surfaces of the fundamental cell but also from its interior section. The number
of liquid particles produced for L∗=240 and 480 is 2 and 5, respectively. During the
vaporization process, collision and coalescence of the liquid particles occur. The
liquid particles for L∗=240 and 480 both coalesce into one liquid particle.
WhenR∗=4, the liquid thread remains intact for L∗=10 and 20. For L∗=24, 30,
60, 120 and 240, the liquid thread ruptures merely from its two ends and only
one liquid particle is formed. For L∗=480, the thread ruptures not only from the
top and bottom surfaces of the fundamental cell but also from its interior section.
Three liquid particles are produced. The liquid particles eventually coalesce into
one liquid particle.
Figure 6 shows the vaporization processes for liquid threads of R∗=4 at T ∗=1.0(cases
24∼30 in Table 1). Unlike the liquid threads of the same radius R∗=4 at a lower
temperature T ∗=0.75(cases 16∼23 in Table 1), the liquid thread remains intact only
for L∗=10. For L∗=20, 30, 60 and 120, the liquid thread ruptures from its two ends,
i.e. the top and bottom surfaces of the fundamental cell, and only one liquid particle
is formed. For L∗=240 and 480, the thread ruptures not only from the top and bot-
tom surfaces of the fundamental cell but also from its interior section. The number
of liquid particles produced for L∗=240 and 480 is 2 and 4, respectively. During the
vaporization process, collision and coalescence of the liquid particles occur. The
liquid particles eventually coalesce into one liquid particle.
From the above discussion for Figs.3∼6, the following observations can be ob-
tained.
First, if the fundamental cell length is long enough, more than one liquid particle
may be produced in the cell. Under such situation, the liquid thread ruptures not
only from its two ends but also from the interior of the fundamental cell. On the
other hand, if the fundamental cell length is small, the liquid thread may remain
intact or produce only one liquid particle in the cell. If the thread breaks up, it
ruptures from its two ends only, i.e. the top and bottom surfaces of the fundamental
cell, but not from its interior.
Second, a liquid thread with a longer fundamental cell length may produce more
liquid particles in the cell.
Third, a thinner liquid thread may produce more liquid particles in the cell.

Molecular Dynamics Analysis of the Instability for a Nano-Scale Liquid Thread 279
For R∗=4, λ ∗c is 25.2. From Fig.5 or Table 1(Cases 16∼23), the liquid threads of
L∗=10 and 20 remain intact while the liquid thread of L∗=24 is unstable. Rayleigh’s
stability criterion holds for the first two cases but violates the MD simulation re-
sults for the third case. The remaining liquid threads withL∗>λ ∗c(L∗=30∼480)are
unstable and break up into drop(s). Rayleigh’s stability criterion holds for these
cases.
If the temperature of the liquid threads of R∗=4 is increased to T ∗=1.0, from Fig.6 or
Table 1(Cases 24∼30), only the liquid thread of L∗=10 remains intact while, in con-
trast to the situation of T ∗=0.75, the liquid thread of L∗=20 is unstable. Rayleigh’s
stability criterion holds for the former case but violates the MD simulation results
for the latter case. The remaining liquid threads withL∗>λ ∗c(L∗=30∼480)are unsta-
ble and break up into drop(s). Rayleigh’s stability criterion holds for these cases.
Recently, Kim, Lee, Han and Park (2006) proposed a new linear relation from their
MD simulation results. From their study, Rayleigh’s linear relation can be modified
as
λc = 2.44pi(R−1.23) (4)
From Eq.(4), λ ∗c for R∗ of 2, 3 and 4 are 5.9, 13.6 and 21.2, respectively. Then,
from Table 1(Cases 1∼23), it is seen that Kim’s stability criterion holds for the
liquid threads at T ∗=0.75. On the other hand, at T ∗=1.0(Cases 24∼30), the liq-
uid thread of R∗=4 and L∗=10 remains intact while the liquid thread of R∗=4 and
L∗=20 is unstable. Kim’s stability criterion holds for the former case but vio-
lates the MD simulation results for the latter case. The remaining liquid threads
withL∗>λ ∗c(L∗=30∼480)are unstable and break up into drop(s). Kim’s stability cri-
terion holds for these cases.
From the above discussion, the following observations can be made.
First, a liquid thread with a longer fundamental cell length is more unstable.
Second, a thinner liquid thread is more unstable.
Third, a liquid thread at a higher temperature is more unstable.
Fourth, the trends of linear stability theories agree with MD simulation results.
However, Rayleigh’s stability criterion overpredicts stable domain as compared to
the MD simulation results. Kim’s stability criterion gives more accurate predic-
tions. However, it overpredicts the stable domain at a higher temperature as com-
pared to the MD simulation results.
3.3 Density Distribution
In practical applications, e.g. combustor or printer, faster vaporization is usually
desirable. Criteria have to be made to quantify the discussion regarding the vapor-

of a liquid thread. The density uniformity factor, fρ , is defined as
fρ =
∑N
(
ρ∗−ρ∗eq
)
t∗∆V
∑N
(
ρ∗−ρ∗eq
)
t∗=0∆V
(6)
where N is the total number of molecules in the fundamental cell, i.e. Nmol in Table
1, ρ∗ and V are the density and volume of molecule i, respectively, as defined by
Eq.(5), and ρ∗eq is the density value when the molecules are uniformly distributed,
i.e. ρ∗eq ≡Nmol/ Vol, where Vol is the volume of the fundamental cell. The density
uniformity factor, fρ , as defined by Eq.(6) represents the deviation from uniform
state. From Fig.7 or Table 1, the following observations can be drawn.
First, a liquid thread with a shorter fundamental cell length evaporates quicker.
Take the liquid threads of R∗=2(Cases 1∼7)as an example. The liquid thread of
L∗=10(Case 1)produces one liquid particle while the liquid thread of L∗=480(Case
7)produces ten liquid particles. The length of the latter liquid thread is forty-eight
times of the former one. This implies that if forty-eight liquid threads of L∗=10
are connected in series, there will be forty-eight liquid particles. It is known that
molecular interaction plays an important role in the vaporization process. More
liquid particles can provide more molecular interactions and this is conducive to
vaporization.
Second, a liquid thread evaporates quicker at a higher temperature.
Third, a liquid thread with a higher fρ is more unstable and produces more liquid
particles in the fundamental cell.
4 Conclusions
In this study, the instability of a liquid thread is investigated by MD simulation. It is
found that a liquid thread is more unstable and produces more liquid particles in the
fundamental cell when it is thinner or at a higher temperature. In addition, a liquid
thread with a longer fundamental cell length is also more unstable and produces
more liquid particles in the fundamental cell, but it evaporates slower. The trends
of linear stability theories agree with MD simulation results. However, Rayleigh’s
stability criterion overpredicts stable domain as compared to the MD simulation
results. Kim’s stability criterion gives more accurate predictions but overpredicts
the stable domain at a higher temperature. Finally, a liquid thread with a higher
time averaged density uniformity factor, fρ , is more unstable and produces more
liquid particles in the fundamental cell.

Lennard-Jones liquid threads by MD simulation and
concluded that Rayleigh’s continuum prediction holds 
down to the molecular scale. Kim, Lee, Han and Park
6) applied MD simulation to investigate the
thermodynamic properties and stability characteristics
of the nano-scale liquid thread. They found that the
overall trends of the simulation results agree with the
classical stability theory. However, the classical
theory overpredicts the region of stable domain
compared to the MD results as the radius decreases.

In the following discussion, Rayleigh’s stability
criterion is accessed for their validity in molecular
scale. The influences of liquid thread radius,
fundamental cell length, and temperature will be
discussed. Snapshots of molecules, number of liquid
particles formed, and density field are analyzed. This

2. Molecular Dynamics Simulation Method
In this study, the vaporization process of a liquid
thread is investigated by MD simulation. The
inter-atomic potential is one of the most important
parts of MD simulation. Many possible potential
models exist, such as hard sphere, soft sphere, square
well, etc 7). In this research, the Lennard-Jones 12-6
potential model, which is widely used, is adopted for
calculation. It is

research is taken to be argon for its ease of physical
understanding. The parameters for argon are as

simulation of a liquid thread
and R=1.06nm, respectively. It is found that when
R*=2, the liquid thread breaks up into drops for all
fundamental cell lengths. For L*=10, 20, 30 and 60,
the liquid thread ruptures only from its two ends, i.e.
the top and bottom surfaces of the fundamental cell,
and gets shorter due to the contraction motion in its
axial direction. Only one liquid particle is formed. On
the other hand, for L*=120, 240 and 480, the thread
ruptures not only from the top and bottom surfaces of
the fundamental cell but also from its interior section.
The number of liquid particles produced for L*=120,
240 and 480 is 2, 5 and 10, respectively. During the
vaporization process, collision and coalescence of the
liquid particles occur. The two liquid particles
produced for L*=120 coalesce into one liquid particle.
The number of liquid particles at t*=1000 for L*=240
and 480 is 3 and 5, respectively.

at T*=0.75
When R*=3, the liquid thread breaks up into drops
for all fundamental cell lengths except L*=10 for
which the liquid thread remains intact. For L*=20, 30,
60 and 120, the liquid thread ruptures merely from its
two ends and only one liquid particle is formed. For
L*=240 and 480, the thread ruptures not only from the
top and bottom surfaces of the fundamental cell but
also from its interior section. The number of liquid
particles produced for L*=240 and 480 is 2 and 5,
respectively. During the vaporization process,
collision and coalescence of the liquid particles occur.
The liquid particles for L*=240 and 480 both coalesce
into one liquid particle.

Fig.6 Vaporization processes of liquid threads of R*=4
at T*=1.0
From the above discussion for Figs.3~6, the
following observations can be obtained.
First, if the fundamental cell length is long enough,
more than one liquid particle may be produced in the
cell. Under such situation, the liquid thread ruptures
not only from its two ends but also from the interior of
the fundamental cell. On the other hand, if the
fundamental cell length is small, the liquid thread may
remain intact or produce only one liquid particle in the
cell. If the thread breaks up, it ruptures from its two
ends only, i.e. the top and bottom surfaces of the
fundamental cell, but not from its interior.
Second, a liquid thread with a longer fundamental
cell length may produce more liquid particles in the
cell.
Third, a thinner liquid thread may produce more
liquid particles in the cell.
Fourth, a liquid thread at a higher temperature
may produce more liquid particles.
3.2Rayleigh’s Stability Analysis
According to the classical theory by Rayleigh
(1879), the radius of the liquid thread, R, is related to
the critical wavelength of perturbation,λc , as
λc=2πR (3)
A liquid thread will break up into drops if the axial
wavelength of the surface perturbation L＞λc. If L＜λc,
the thread is stable and will remain intact. Owing to
the periodic boundary conditions in this study, the
fundamental cell size L* can be regarded as the
longest wavelength of the perturbation.
For R*=2, λc* is 12.6. According to Rayleigh’s
stability criterion, a liquid thread of radius R*=2 and
length L*=10 is expected to be stable and remain
intact. However, from Fig.3 or Table 1（Case 1）, it is
seen that the liquid thread of R*=2 and L*=10 is
unstable, which implies that Rayleigh’s stability
criterion overpredicts the stable domain as compared
to the MD simulation results. Rayleigh’s stability
criterion holds for the remaining liquid threads with
L*＞λc*（L*=20~480）, which are unstable and break
up into drop(s).
For R*=3, λc* is 18.9. From Fig.4 or Table 1, the
liquid thread of R*=3 and L*=10 remains intact.
Rayleigh’s stability criterion holds for this case. The
remaining liquid threads with L*＞λc*（L*=20~480）
are unstable and break up into drop(s). Rayleigh’s
stability criterion also holds for these cases.
For R*=4, λc* is 25.2. From Fig.5 or Table 1, the
liquid threads of L*=10 and 20 remain intact.
Rayleigh’s stability criterion holds for these cases.
The remaining liquid threads with L* ＞ λc*
（L*=30~480）are unstable and break up into drop(s).
of R*=2 as an example. The liquid thread of L*=10
（Case 1）produces one liquid particle while the liquid
thread of L*=480（Case 7）produces ten liquid
particles. The length of the latter liquid thread is
forty-eight times of the former one. This implies that
if forty-eight liquid threads of L*=10 are connected in
series, there will be forty-eight liquid particles. It is
known that molecular interaction plays an important
role in the vaporization process. More liquid particles
can provide more molecular interactions and this is
conducive to vaporization.
Second, a liquid thread evaporates quicker at a
higher temperature.
Third, a liquid thread with a higher f is more
unstable and produces more liquid particles in the
fundamental cell.
More detailed analyses and results can be found in
the author’s another paper 8).
4. Conclusions
In this study, the instability of a liquid thread is
investigated by MD simulation. It is found that a
liquid thread is more unstable and produces more
liquid particles in the fundamental cell when it is
thinner or at a higher temperature. In addition, a liquid
thread with a longer fundamental cell length is also
more unstable and produces more liquid particles in
the fundamental cell, but it evaporates slower. The
trend of Rayleigh’s stability criterion agrees with MD 
simulation results although it overpredicts stable
domain as compared to the MD simulation results.
Finally, a liquid thread with a higher time averaged
density uniformity factor, f , is more unstable and
produces more liquid particles in the fundamental cell.

atomization process. In the author’s previous 
studies [1,2] for atomizer flow, it can be seen that 
the liquid evolves into threads after leaving the 
atomizer. The existing researches for nano-scale 
liquid threads are almost devoted to the 
investigation of a single liquid thread in a periodic 
fundamental cell. Lord Rayleigh [3] analyzed the 
instability of an inviscid liquid cylinder and a 
viscous one. Later on, Weber [4] and Tomotika [5] 
considered more realistic cases of liquid threads in 
unbounded domains. Goren [6] studied the annular 
thread of fluid in contact with a solid. He used 
linear stability analysis to determine the fastest 
growing mode when either inertia or viscous forces 
are negligible. Koplik and Banavar [7] studied the 
Rayleigh’s instability of a cylindrical liquid thread 
in vacuum by three-dimensional molecular 
dynamics (MD) simulation. The maximum number 
of molecules they used consists of 8,192 liquid 
argon Lennard-Jones molecules for a cylindrical 
liquid thread of non-dimensionalized radius of 7.5 
in a box of non-dimensionalized length of 54.7. For 
this simulation condition, only one liquid particle 
was formed. If a smaller computational domain was 
used instead, no liquid particle was found from their 
study. Kawano [8] applied 10,278 Lennard-Jones 
molecules of liquid and vapor coexisting argon in 
three dimensions to analyze the interfacial motion 
of a cylindrical liquid thread of 
non-dimensionalized radii of 2.0 to 4.0 in a box of 
non-dimensionalized length up to 120. For this 
condition of larger computational domain, a 
maximum number of 8 to 9 liquid particles were 
observed. Min and Wong [9] studied the Rayleigh’s 
instability of nano-scale Lennard-Jones liquid 
threads by MD simulation and concluded that 
Rayleigh’s continuum prediction holds down to the 
molecular scale. Kim, Lee, Han and Park [10] 
applied MD simulation to investigate the 
thermodynamic properties and stability 
characteristics of the nano-scale liquid thread. They 
found that the overall trends of the simulation 
results agree with the classical stability theory. 
However, the classical theory overpredicts the 
region of stable domain compared to the MD results 
as the radius decreases.  
  As mentioned above, the existing researches for 
nano-scale liquid threads are almost devoted to the 
investigation of a single liquid thread in a periodic 
fundamental cell. This study is the first to 
investigate the vaporization process of two 
nano-scale liquid threads coexisting in a periodic 
fundamental cell by MD simulation. Because of the 
interaction between the two nano-scale liquid 
threads coexisting in a periodic fundamental cell, 
the vaporization process is different from that of a 
single liquid thread in a periodic fundamental cell. 
In this study, the influences of liquid thread radius, 
fundamental cell length, and relative position of the 
two threads are discussed. Snapshots of molecules, 
number of liquid particles formed, and density field 
are analyzed. Two linear stability criteria, namely 
Rayleigh’s stability criterion and Kim’s stability 
criterion, are accessed for their validity in molecular 
scale. This will be helpful for the understanding and 
prediction of the atomization process.

where r denotes the distance between two 
molecules, ε and σ are the representative scales of 
energy and length, respectively. The Lennard-Jones 
fluid in this research is taken to be argon for its ease 
of physical understanding. The parameters for argon 
are as follows [8] : the length parameter σ=0.354 
nm, the energy parameter ε/kB=93.3K, and the 
molecular weight m=6.64×10-26 kg, where 
kB=1.38×10-23 J/K denotes the Boltzmann constant. 
The cut-off radius rc beyond which the 
intermolecular interaction is neglected is 5.0σ. 
   The simulation domain is schematically shown 
in Fig.1, with periodic boundary conditions applied 
in all three directions. Simulation domain 
dimensions, relative position of the two threads and 
number of molecules are listed in Table 1, together 
with some simulation results. Note that in table 1, 
the number in the parenthesis of the Np column 
denotes the number of liquid particles formed at 
time t*=1000, while the number outside the 
parenthesis of the Np column denotes the maximum 
number of liquid particles formed during the 
vaporization process. If no parenthesis is denoted, it 
means that the maximum number of liquid particles 
formed prevails over the vaporization process. The 
time integration of motion is performed by Gear’s 
fifth predictor-corrector method [11] with a time 
step of △t*=0.001（i.e. 2.5 fs）. Note that all 
quantities with an asterisk in this paper, such as L*,

and the production stages. 
In practical applications, e.g. combustor or 
printer, faster vaporization is usually desirable. 
Criteria have to be made to quantify the discussion 
regarding the vaporization process of a liquid thread. 
In this research, a liquid thread is considered to 
vaporize faster if the distribution of molecules 
reaches uniform state quicker during the 
vaporization process. This criterion essentially 
concerns with the evolution of the density 
distribution. The density at a specified point in the 
fundamental cell can be defined as  
V
N
V 
  0lim              (3) 
where δV is a small volume surrounding the point 
considered and δN is the number of molecules 
inside the volume δV. The density defined by Eq.(3) 
is actually an averaged density of a small volume 
surrounding the point considered. The value will 
approach the density of a specified point if the 
volume δV shrinks to that point. However, for a 
meaningful density field, the volume δV can not be 
too small because when δV becomes too small, it is 
difficult to obtain a definite value for δN/δV. In this 
study, the volume δV is taken to be a sphere with 
non-dimensionalized radius R*=2 and with its 
center located at the point considered. This is an 
optimal choice after numerical test.  
The time averaged density uniformity factor, f , 
in a time interval of t*=0 to 1000, as listed in Table 
1, can be used to indicate the vaporization speed of 
the liquid threads. The density uniformity factor, fρ , 
is defined as

where N is the total number of molecules in the

density value when the molecules are uniformly

f , implies that the distribution of liquid thread 
molecules reaches uniform state quicker during the 
vaporization process and therefore represents a 
faster vaporization. 
 
3. Results and Discussions 
In the following discussion, two cylindrical 
liquid threads of length L* and radius R* are placed 
in the computational domain and the remaining 
space is vacuum. The relative position of the two 
threads is controlled by L1*, L2* and L4*, as shown 
in Fig.1. Simulation domain dimensions and 
number of molecules are listed in Table 1. 
 
3.1 Liquid Thread Vaporization Process  
   Figure 2 shows the vaporization process of two 
liquid threads of R*=4, L*=30, L1*=10, L2*=10 and 
L4*=15（case 1 in Table 1）. Note that L*=30 and 
R*=4 correspond to L=10.6nm and R=1.41nm, 
respectively. It is seen that the two liquid threads 
quickly coalesce into a single thread and remain 
intact. No liquid particles are formed during the 
vaporization process. Figure 3 shows the 
vaporization process of two liquid threads of 
smaller radius R*=2 but with the same length and 
relative position : L*=30, L1*=10, L2*=10 and 
L4*=15（case 2 in Table 1）. For this case of thinner 
liquid threads, it is seen that the two threads rupture 
from their two ends, i.e. the top and bottom surfaces 
of the fundamental cell, and get shorter due to the 
contraction motion in their axial directions. Two 
liquid particles are formed and they quickly 
coalesce into a single one by collision and 
coalescence. The coalesced liquid particle prevails 
during the subsequent vaporization process.  
From table 1, it is seen that the value of f  is 
smaller for the thinner liquid threads. As stated in 
the previous section, this implies that the thinner 
liquid threads evaporate quicker. In addition, it can 
be seen from table 1 that the thinner liquid threads 
produce more liquid particles. In the author’s 
previous study [12], it has been found that a single 
liquid thread is more unstable and produces more 
liquid particles when it is thinner. The present 
results for two liquid threads coexisting in a 
fundamental cell corroborate the findings of the 
author’s previous study for a single liquid thread.

  From the above discussion, the following 
observations can be obtained. 
  First, if the fundamental cell length is small, the 
liquid threads may remain intact or evolve into only 
one liquid particle in the cell. If the threads break 
up in this case, they rupture from their ends only, i.e. 
the top and bottom surfaces of the fundamental cell, 
but not from their interiors. On the other hand, if the 
fundamental cell length is larger, more than one 
liquid particle may be produced in the cell and the 
liquid threads may rupture not only from their ends 
but also from their interiors.  
  Second, thinner liquid threads may produce more 
liquid particles in the cell and evaporate quicker. 
  Third, more liquid particles are formed when the 
separation of the two threads is larger and 
vaporization is slower when the two liquid threads 
are close to each other. 
  Fourth, on the basis of identical liquid thread 
radius and length, liquid threads that produce more 
liquid particles evaporate quicker. 
 
3.2 Stability Analysis 
In the scope of fluid flow researches, the 
instability has received much attention due to its 
potential influence on the flow development. 
Previous instability analyses, e.g., Lord Rayleigh 
[3], Weber [4] and Tomotika [5], were focused 
mainly on large scale flow fields. The 
applicabilities of these theories to micro- or 
nano-scale flow fields are still uncertain. On the 
other hand, the existing instability analyses for 
nano-scale liquid threads, e.g., Koplik and Banavar 
[7], Kawano [8], Min and Wong [9], Kim, Lee, Han 
and Park [10] and Yeh [12], were devoted to the

Abstract 
  The existing researches for nano-scale liquid threads are almost devoted to the 
investigation of a single liquid thread in a periodic fundamental cell. This paper is the 
first to study the vaporization process of two nano-scale liquid threads coexisting in a 
periodic fundamental cell by molecular dynamics（MD）simulation. Because of the 
interaction between the two liquid threads, the vaporization process is different from 
that of a single liquid thread in a periodic fundamental cell. In this study, the influences 
of liquid thread radius, fundamental cell length, and relative position of the two threads 
are discussed. Snapshots of molecules, number of liquid particles formed, and density 
field are analyzed. Two linear stability criteria, namely Rayleigh’s stability criterion and 
Kim’s stability criterion, are accessed for their validity in molecular scale. It is found 
that the two liquid threads may remain intact or evolve into only one liquid particle if 
the fundamental cell length is small. If the threads break up in this case, they rupture 
from their ends only, i.e. the top and bottom surfaces of the fundamental cell, but not 
from their interiors. On the other hand, if the fundamental cell length is larger, more 
than one liquid particle may be produced in the cell and the liquid threads rupture not 
only from their ends but also from their interiors. It is also found that thinner liquid 
threads may produce more liquid particles in the cell and evaporate quicker. In addition, 
more liquid particles are formed when the separation of the two threads is larger and 
vaporization is slower when the two liquid threads are close to each other. On the basis 
of identical liquid thread radius and length, liquid threads that produce more liquid 
particles evaporate quicker. Finally, the trends of Rayleigh’s stability criterion and 
Kim’s stability criterion agree with MD simulation results. However, when the two 
threads coalesce into a single thread and remain intact, the critical wavelength of 
perturbation may be increased and the stable domain is broadened. Under such situation, 
Rayleigh’s stability criterion and Kim’s stability criterion underpredict the stable 
domain.

1. Introduction 
The formation of liquid threads is one of the most fundamental and important 
phenomena during the atomization process. In the author’s previous studies [Yeh (2005, 
2009a)] for atomizer flow, it can be seen that the liquid evolves into threads after 
leaving the atomizer. The existing researches for nano-scale liquid threads are almost 
devoted to the investigation of a single liquid thread in a periodic fundamental cell. 
Lord Rayleigh (1879) analyzed the instability of an inviscid liquid cylinder and a 
viscous one. Later on, Weber (1931) and Tomotika (1935) considered more realistic 
cases of liquid threads in unbounded domains. Goren (1962) studied the annular thread 
of fluid in contact with a solid. He used linear stability analysis to determine the fastest 
growing mode when either inertia or viscous forces are negligible. Koplik and Banavar 
(1993) studied the Rayleigh’s instability of a cylindrical liquid thread in vacuum by 
three-dimensional molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The maximum number of 
molecules they used consists of 8,192 liquid argon Lennard-Jones molecules for a 
cylindrical liquid thread of non-dimensionalized radius of 7.5 in a box of 
non-dimensionalized length of 54.7. For this simulation condition, only one liquid 
particle was formed. If a smaller computational domain was used instead, no liquid 
particle was found from their study. Kawano (1998) applied 10,278 Lennard-Jones 
molecules of liquid and vapor coexisting argon in three dimensions to analyze the 
interfacial motion of a cylindrical liquid thread of non-dimensionalized radii of 2.0 to 
4.0 in a box of non-dimensionalized length up to 120. For this condition of larger 
computational domain, a maximum number of 8 to 9 liquid particles were observed. 
Min and Wong (2006) studied the Rayleigh’s instability of nano-scale Lennard-Jones 
liquid threads by MD simulation and concluded that Rayleigh’s continuum prediction 
holds down to the molecular scale. Kim, Lee, Han and Park (2006) applied MD 
simulation to investigate the thermodynamic properties and stability characteristics of 
the nano-scale liquid thread. They found that the overall trends of the simulation results 
agree with the classical stability theory. However, the classical theory overpredicts the 
region of stable domain compared to the MD results as the radius decreases.  
To establish a nano-scale system is still a complex task because of the major 
challenges for fabricating the nano-locating and nano-driving assemblies. On the other 
hand, MD can offer novel insights into the underlying atomistic mechanisms and 
nano-scale behavior due to their high temporal and spatial resolution. Liu and Tsai
（2009）proposed a numerical method for extracting the thermo-mechanical properties 
of a thin-film. In their study, MD simulations were utilized to establish the 
load-displacement response of a thin copper substrate. Nair, Farkas, and Kriz（2008）
studied the indentation response of Ni thin films of thicknesses in the nano-scale using 
MD simulations with embedded atom method (EAM) inter-atomic potentials. Their

coexisting in a periodic fundamental cell by MD simulation. Because of the interaction 
between the two nano-scale liquid threads coexisting in a periodic fundamental cell, the 
vaporization process is different from that of a single liquid thread in a periodic 
fundamental cell. In this study, the influences of liquid thread radius, fundamental cell 
length, and relative position of the two threads are discussed. Snapshots of molecules, 
number of liquid particles formed, and density field are analyzed. Two linear stability 
criteria, namely Rayleigh’s stability criterion and Kim’s stability criterion, are accessed 
for their validity in molecular scale. This will be helpful for the understanding and 
prediction of the atomization process. 
 
2. Molecular Dynamics Simulation Method 
In this study, the vaporization process of the liquid threads is investigated by MD 
simulation. The inter-atomic potential is one of the most important parts of MD 
simulation. Many possible potential models exist, such as hard sphere, soft sphere, 
square well, etc [Haile （1992）]. In this research, the Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential 
model, which is widely used, is adopted for calculation. It is

where r denotes the distance between two molecules, ε and σ are the representative 
scales of energy and length, respectively. The Lennard-Jones fluid in this research is 
taken to be argon for its ease of physical understanding. The parameters for argon are as 
follows [Kawano (1998)] : the length parameter σ=0.354 nm, the energy parameter 
ε/kB=93.3K, and the molecular weight m=6.64×10-26 kg, where kB=1.38×10-23 J/K 
denotes the Boltzmann constant. The cut-off radius rc beyond which the intermolecular 
interaction is neglected is 5.0σ. 
   The simulation domain is schematically shown in Fig.1, with periodic boundary 
conditions applied in all three directions. Simulation domain dimensions, relative 
position of the two threads and number of molecules are listed in Table 1, together with 
some simulation results. Note that in table 1, the number in the parenthesis of the Np 
column denotes the number of liquid particles formed at time t*=1000, while the

means that the maximum number of liquid particles formed prevails over the

    In this research, two cylindrical liquid threads of length L* and radius R* are 
placed in the computational domain and the remaining space is vacuum. The relative 
position of the two threads is controlled by L1*, L2* and L4*, as shown in Fig.1. L3* is 
set to be zero, i.e. the two liquid threads are kept at x=0 initially and are shifted only in 
the y direction. The initial density of the liquid argon is ρL*=0.819 and the system 
temperature is kept at T*=0.75. These dimensionless values correspond to ρL=1223 
kg/m3 for argon and T=70K, which is below the critical temperature（150K）of argon.  
The procedure for MD simulation includes three stages : initialization, equilibration 
and production. Initially, equilibration is performed for liquid argon molecules in a 
 9
is taken to be a sphere with non-dimensionalized radius R*=2 and with its center located 
at the point considered. This is an optimal choice after numerical test.  
The time averaged density uniformity factor, f , in a time interval of t*=0 to 1000, 
as listed in Table 1, can be used to indicate the vaporization speed of the liquid threads. 
The density uniformity factor, fρ , is defined as

where N is the total number of molecules in the fundamental cell, i.e. Nmol in Table 1, 
ρ* and △V are the density and volume of molecule i, respectively, as defined by Eq.(3), 
and ρ*eq is the density value when the molecules are uniformly distributed, i.e. 
ρ*eq≡Nmol / Vol, where Vol is the volume of the fundamental cell. The density 
uniformity factor, fρ , as defined by Eq.(4) represents the deviation from uniform state. 
A smaller time averaged density uniformity factor, f , implies that the distribution of 
liquid thread molecules reaches uniform state quicker during the vaporization process 
and therefore represents a faster vaporization. 
 
3. Results and Discussions 
In the following discussion, two cylindrical liquid threads of length L* and radius 
R* are placed in the computational domain and the remaining space is vacuum. The 
relative position of the two threads is controlled by L1*, L2* and L4*, as shown in Fig.1. 
Simulation domain dimensions and number of molecules are listed in Table 1. 
 
3.1 Liquid Thread Vaporization Process  
   Figure 2 shows the vaporization process of two liquid threads of R*=4, L*=30, 
L1*=10, L2*=10 and L4*=15（case 1 in Table 1）. Note that L*=30 and R*=4 correspond 
to L=10.6nm and R=1.41nm, respectively. It is seen that the two liquid threads quickly 
coalesce into a single thread and remain intact. No liquid particles are formed during the 
vaporization process. Figure 3 shows the vaporization process of two liquid threads of 
smaller radius R*=2 but with the same length and relative position : L*=30, L1*=10, 
L2*=10 and L4*=15（case 2 in Table 1）. For this case of thinner liquid threads, it is seen 
that the two threads rupture from their two ends, i.e. the top and bottom surfaces of the 
fundamental cell, and get shorter due to the contraction motion in their axial directions.

denotes the situation for a single liquid thread of the same radius and length as cases 3 
and 4. From table 1, it is observed that only one liquid particle is formed for case 5 and 
the vaporization speed for case 5 is slower than case 3, for which two liquid particles 
are formed. The present results for two liquid threads coexisting in a fundamental cell 
corroborate the findings of the author’s previous study for a single liquid thread.

Figure 5  Vaporization process of two liquid threads of R*=4, L*=60, L1*=10, L2*=25, 
L3*=0, L4*=30 
 
   Figure 6 shows the vaporization process of two liquid threads of R*=2, L*=60, 
L1*=30, L2*=15 and L4*=30（case 6 in Table 1）. Similar to case 3, the two threads 
rupture from their two ends and get shorter due to the contraction motion in their axial 
directions. Two liquid particles are formed and prevail during the subsequent 
vaporization process. For two closer liquid threads, e.g., R*=2, L*=60, L1*=10, L2*=25 
and L4*=30（case 7 in Table 1）, the vaporization process, which is shown in Fig.7, is 
different from case 6. The two threads also rupture from their two ends and get shorter 
due to the contraction motion in their axial directions. Two liquid particles are formed 
but they quickly coalesce into a single one and prevail during the subsequent 
vaporization process. This vaporization process is similar to but slightly different from 
that for thicker liquid threads（case 4）.The thinner liquid threads（case 7）evolve into 
two liquid particles and then quickly coalesce into a single one while the thicker liquid 
threads（case 4）quickly coalesce into a single liquid thread and then evolve into a single 
liquid particle. 
From table 1, it is seen that the value of f  is larger for case 7, i.e., vaporization is 
slower when the two liquid threads are close to each other. In addition, it can be seen 
from table 1 that more liquid particles are produced when the separation of the two 
threads is larger（case 6）. Case 8, which has been investigated in the author’s previous 
study (2009b), denotes the situation for a single liquid thread of the same radius and 
length as cases 6 and 7. From table 1, it is seen that only one liquid particle is formed

only one liquid particle is formed for case 12 and the vaporization speed for case 12 is 
slower than cases 9 and 10, for which two liquid particles are formed. This corroborates 
the previous results for shorter liquid threads（cases 3~8）.

If the length of the liquid thread is further increased, e.g. R*=4 and L*=480, more 
liquid particles are formed. Figure 17 shows the vaporization process of two liquid 
threads of R*=4, L*=480, L1*=160, L2*=160 and L4*=240（case 21 in Table 1）. Eight 
liquid particles are formed and they evolve into four liquid particles by collision and 
coalescence. For two closer liquid threads, e.g., R*=4, L*=480, L1*=40, L2*=220 and 
L4*=240（case 22 in Table 1）, the vaporization process, which is shown in Fig.18, is 
similar to but slightly different from case 21. Six liquid particles are formed initially and 
they finally evolve into two liquid particles by collision and coalescence. If the two 
liquid threads get even closer, e.g., R*=4, L*=480, L1*=10, L2*=235 and L4*=240（case 
23 in Table 1）, the vaporization process, which is shown in Fig.19, is very different 
from cases 21 and 22. Because the two threads of case 23 are very close to each other,

From the above discussion, the following observations can be obtained. 
First, if the fundamental cell length is small, the liquid threads may remain intact or 
evolve into only one liquid particle in the cell. If the threads break up in this case, they 
rupture from their ends only, i.e. the top and bottom surfaces of the fundamental cell, 
but not from their interiors. On the other hand, if the fundamental cell length is larger, 
more than one liquid particle may be produced in the cell and the liquid threads may 
rupture not only from their ends but also from their interiors.  
Second, thinner liquid threads may produce more liquid particles in the cell and 
evaporate quicker. 
Third, more liquid particles are formed when the separation of the two threads is 
larger and vaporization is slower when the two liquid threads are close to each other. 
 35
the remaining liquid threads are unstable and break up into drop(s). Rayleigh’s stability 
criterion violates the MD simulation result for case 1 but holds for the remaining cases. 
The invalidity of Rayleigh’s stability criterion for case 1 can be interpreted from the 
vaporization process shown in Fig.2. It is seen that the two liquid threads quickly 
coalesce into a single thread and remain intact. This is somewhat like to combine the 
two threads to form a thread of larger radius, which can increase the critical wavelength 
of perturbation, λc, according to Eq.(5) and therefore broaden the stable domain. 
Recently, Kim, Lee, Han and Park (2006) proposed a new linear relation from their 
MD simulation results. From their study, Rayleigh’s linear relation can be modified as 
λc=2.44π(R-1.23)                            (6) 
   From Eq.(6), λc* for R* of 2 and 4 are 5.9 and 21.2, respectively. Then, from Table 1, 
it is seen that Kim’s stability criterion violates the MD simulation result for case 1 while 
holds for the remaining cases. The validity of Kim’s stability criterion is similar to 
Rayleigh’s stability criterion. 
From the above discussion, it is found that the trends of Rayleigh’s stability 
criterion and Kim’s stability criterion agree with MD simulation results. However, when 
the two liquid threads coalesce into a single one and remain intact, the critical 
wavelength of perturbation may be increased and the stable domain is broadened. Under 
such situation, Rayleigh’s stability criterion and Kim’s stability criterion underpredict 
the stable domain. 
 
4. Conclusions 
  In this study, the vaporization process of two nano-scale liquid threads coexisting 
in a periodic fundamental cell is investigated by MD simulation. The influences of 
liquid thread radius, fundamental cell length, and relative position of the two threads are 
discussed. Snapshots of molecules, number of liquid particles formed, and density field 
are analyzed. Two linear stability criteria, namely Rayleigh’s stability criterion and 
Kim’s stability criterion, are accessed for their validity in molecular scale. It is found 
that the two liquid threads may remain intact or evolve into only one liquid particle if 
the fundamental cell length is small. If the threads break up in this case, they rupture 
from their ends only, i.e. the top and bottom surfaces of the fundamental cell, but not 
from their interiors. On the other hand, if the fundamental cell length is larger, more 
than one liquid particle may be produced in the cell and the liquid threads rupture not 
only from their ends but also from their interiors. It is also found that thinner liquid

Summary
This paper investigates Rayleigh’s instability of a liquid thread by molecular dynamics（MD）simulation. The
influences of liquid thread radius, fundamental cell length, and temperature are discussed. Snapshots of molecules,
number of liquid particles formed, and density field are analyzed. It is found that a liquid thread is more unstable
and produces more liquid particles in the fundamental cell when it is thinner or at a higher temperature. In
addition, a liquid thread with a longer fundamental cell length is also more unstable and produces more liquid
particles in the fundamental cell, but it evaporates slower. The trend of Rayleigh’s stability criterion agrees with 
MD simulation results although it overpredicts stable domain as compared to the MD simulation results. Finally, a
liquid thread with a higher time averaged density uniformity factor, f , is more unstable and produces more
liquid particles in the fundamental cell.
Keywords : Nano-Scale Liquid Thread, Molecular Dynamics Simulation,Rayleigh’s stability criterion
1. Introduction
In the scope of fluid flow researches, the
instability has received much attention due to its
potential influence on the flow development. Previous
instability analyses were focused mainly on large
scale flow fields. The applicabilities of these theories
to micro- or nano-scale flow fields are still uncertain.
To establish a nano-scale system is still a complex
task because of the major challenges for fabricating
the nano-locating and nano-driving assemblies. On the
other hand, molecular dynamics (MD) can offer novel
insights into the underlying atomistic mechanisms and
nanometer-scale behavior due to their high temporal
and spatial resolution.
In Fig.1, the fluid/air interface for atomizer flow
by macroscopic analysis from the author’s previous 
studies 1) is shown. It can be seen that the liquid
evolves into threads after leaving the atomizer. The
formation of liquid threads is one of the most
fundamental and important phenomena during the
atomization process. Goren 2) studied the annular
liquid films in contact with a solid, i.e., supported on a
wire or lining the interior walls of a capillary. Koplik
and Banavar 3) studied the Rayleigh’s instability of a 
cylindrical liquid thread in vacuum by
three-dimensional MD simulation. Kawano 4) applied
10,278 Lennard-Jones molecules of liquid and vapor
coexisting argon in three dimensions to analyze the
interfacial motion of a cylindrical liquid thread of
non-dimensionalized radii of 2.0 to 4.0 in a box of
non-dimensionalized length up to 120. Min and Wong
5) studied the Rayleigh’s instability of nanometer scale

In this research, a cylindrical liquid thread of
length L* and radius R* is placed at the center of the
computational domain and the remaining space is
vacuum. The initial density of the liquid argon is
ρL*=0.819. The system temperature is kept at T*=0.75
or 1.0. These dimensionless values correspond to
ρL=1223 kg/m3 for argon and T=70K or 93.3K. Note
that these two temperatures are below the critical
temperature（150K）of argon.
The procedure for MD simulation includes three
stages : initialization, equilibration and production.
Initially, equilibration is performed for liquid argon
molecules in a rectangular parallelepiped with length
and width equal to the liquid thread diameter
(D*=2R*=4, 6, 8) and with height equal to the side
length of the computational domain (L*=10, 20, 30,
60, 120, 240, 480). The initial velocities of molecules
are decided by normal random numbers. Velocity
rescaling is performed at each time step by Eq.(2) to
make sure that the molecules are at the desired
temperature T* :
A
Dold
i
new
i T
T
vv  (2)
where vi
new and vi
old are the velocities of molecule i
after and before correction, respectively, and TD and
TA are the desired and the actual molecular
temperatures, respectively. The liquid molecules are
equilibrated for 106 time steps at the desired
temperature T*. The achievement of equilibrium state
is confirmed by obtaining the radial distribution
function. After the liquid molecules are equilibrated,
the rectangular parallelepiped for the liquid molecules
is truncated to the desired cylindrical liquid thread by
removing unwanted regions. The cylindrical liquid
thread then is put into the computational domain and
the production stage proceeds. A minimum image
method and the Verlet neighbor list scheme 7) to keep
track of which molecules are actually interacting at a
given time interval of 0.005 are used in the
equilibration and the production stages.
3. Results and Discussions
3.1 Liquid Thread Vaporization Process
In the following discussion, a cylindrical liquid
thread of length L* and radius R* is placed at the
center of the simulation domain and the remaining
space is in vacuum, as illustrated in Fig.2. Simulation
domain dimensions, temperatures and number of
molecules, are listed in Table 1.
Figures 3~5 show the vaporization processes of
liquid threads at T*=0.75（cases 1~21 in Table 1）.
Note that L*=120 and R*=3 correspond to L=42.5nm

Fig.4 Vaporization processes of liquid threads of R*=3
at T*=0.75
When R*=4, the liquid thread remains intact for
L*=10 and 20. For L*=30, 60, 120 and 240, the liquid
thread ruptures merely from its two ends and only one
liquid particle is formed. For L*=480, the thread
ruptures not only from the top and bottom surfaces of
the fundamental cell but also from its interior section.
Three liquid particles are produced. The liquid
particles eventually coalesce into one liquid particle.

Fig.5 Vaporization processes of liquid threads of R*=4
at T*=0.75
Figure 6 shows the vaporization processes for
liquid threads of R*=4 at T*=1.0（cases 22~28 in
Table 1）. Unlike the liquid threads of the same radius
R*=4 at a lower temperature T*=0.75（cases 15~21 in
Table 1）, the liquid thread remains intact only for
L*=10. For L*=20, 30, 60 and 120, the liquid thread
ruptures from its two ends, i.e. the top and bottom
surfaces of the fundamental cell, and only one liquid
particle is formed. For L*=240 and 480, the thread
ruptures not only from the top and bottom surfaces of
the fundamental cell but also from its interior section.
The number of liquid particles produced for L*=240
and 480 is 2 and 4, respectively. During the
vaporization process, collision and coalescence of the
liquid particles occur. The liquid particles eventually
coalesce into one liquid particle.
Rayleigh’s stability criterion also holds for these
cases.
If the temperature of the liquid threads of R*=4 is
increased to T*=1.0, from Fig.6 or Table 1, only the
liquid thread of L*=10 remains intact while, in
contrast to the situation of T*=0.75, the liquid thread
of L*=20 is unstable. Rayleigh’s stability criterion
holds for the former case but violates the MD
simulation results for the latter case. The remaining
liquid threads with L*＞λc*（L*=30~480）are unstable
and break up into drop(s). Rayleigh’s stability
criterion holds for these cases.
From the above discussion, the following
observations can be made.
First, a liquid thread with a longer fundamental
cell length is more unstable.
Second, a thinner liquid thread is more unstable.
Third, a liquid thread at a higher temperature is
more unstable.
Fourth, the trend of Rayleigh’s stability criterion
agrees with MD simulation results. However, it
overpredicts stable domain as compared to the MD
simulation results.
3.3 Density Distribution
In practical applications, e.g. combustor or printer,
faster vaporization is usually desirable. Criteria have
to be made to quantify the discussion regarding the
vaporization process of a liquid thread. In this
research, a liquid thread is considered to vaporize
faster if the distribution of molecules reaches uniform
state quicker during the vaporization process. This
criterion essentially concerns with the evolution of the
density distribution. The density at a specified point in
the fundamental cell can be defined as
V
N
V 

 0
lim

 (4)
where δV is a small volume surrounding the point
considered and δNis the number of molecules inside
the volume δV. The density defined by Eq.(4) is
actually an averaged density of a small volume
surrounding the point considered. The value will
approach the density of a specified point if the volume
δVshrinks to that point. However, for a meaningful
density field, the volume δVcan not be too small
because when δVbecomes too small, it is difficult to
obtain a definite value for δN/δV. In this study, the
volume δV is taken to be a sphere with
non-dimensionalized radius R*=2 and with its center
located at the point considered. This is an optimal
choice after numerical test.
The time averaged density uniformity factor, f ,
in a time interval of t*=0 to 1000, as shown in Fig.7
or listed in Table 1, can be used to indicate the
vaporization speed of a liquid thread. The density
uniformity factor, fρ, is defined as 

where N is the total number of molecules in the
fundamental cell, i.e. Nmol in Table 1, ρ* and △V are
the density and volume of molecule i, respectively, as
defined by Eq.(4), and ρ*eq is the density value when
the molecules are uniformly distributed, i.e. ρ*eq≡Nmol
/ Vol, where Vol is the volume of the fundamental cell.
The density uniformity factor, fρ, as defined by Eq.(5)
represents the deviation from uniform state. From
Fig.7 or Table 1, the following observations can be
drawn.
