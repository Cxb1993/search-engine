Abstract- From the current sensorless control, the 
phase feedforward control (PFFC) for single-phase 
boost-type switching-mode-rectifier (SMR) is 
proposed in this project. Compared to the fixed 
feedforward signal in the conventional feedforward 
control, the phase of the conventional feedforward 
signal now is controllable according to the load 
power which makes PFFC be able to yield more 
feedforward efforts for high load power. For 
implementing the high-sampling-frequency function 
of power factor correction (PFC) in low-cost 
DSP-based system or in digital integrated circuit, 
the economical proportional-type (P-type) feedback 
controller is used in the proposed PFFC instead of 
using the proportional-plus-integral-type (PI-type) 
feedback controller or other complicated controllers. 
The simulation and experimental results also 
demonstrate the proposed PFFC.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The AC/DC converter is an essential component for 
most power electronic systems to build up DC-link 
voltage source from the AC mains. The use of 
switching-mode-rectifier (SMR) with power factor 
correction (PFC) function is an effective mean to 
perform the AC/DC conversion with high input and 
output quality by shaping the input current waveform 
and regulating the output dc voltage. The boost-type 
SMRs are the most popular circuit topology among all 
the others to perform PFC functions for their 
continuous current in the front-end inductors [1-2]. 
Feedforward control is usually used to eliminate or 
reduce the effects of disturbances in a control system. It 
is also very useful in single-phase PFC applications 
with time-varying current references where input 
voltage feedforward has been successfully applied to 
eliminate the dependency of voltage loop gain on input 
root mean square voltage. In addition, in order to 
obtain better current tracking performance, many 
current controllers had been developed in the literatures, 
such as predictive control[3], mixed-mode control[4], 
robust current control[5] and feedback control [6,7]…. 
Most of them also include the feedforward loops in 
their current controller [3-7]. 
The basic idea of the conventional feedforward loop 
is to generate the “nominal duty ratio pattern” derived 
only from rectified input voltage in order to alleviate 
the task of the feedback controller. This nominal duty 
ratio pattern effectively produces a voltage across the 
switch whose average over a switching cycle is equal 
to the instantaneous rectified input voltage. A 
sinusoidal input current can then be produced by the 
feedback controller that changes the duty ratio around 
this nominal pattern according to current error. 
However, it is noted that this nominal duty ratio pattern 
is fixed regardless of load power. That is, the nominal 
duty ratio pattern generated in heavy load is the same 
as that in light load. 
Therefore, in order to generate a flexible (i.e. 
load-dependent) feedforward signal to help the 
feedback controller, “full feedforward” in [7] and “load 
feedforward” in [8] had been developed. In the former, 
the feedforward signal is not only from the rectified 
input voltage but also from the inductor current 
command. Otherwise, in the latter, an additional load 
current must be sensed to generate the flexible 
feedforward signal. Both feedforward loops can 
provide more forward duty than the nominal one when 
the AC/DC system must yield larger power. 
However, the full feedforward loop [7] is 
implemented in analog circuits but it is not suitable for 
the digital control system for the need of acceptable 
resolution in digital implementation. The need of 
sensing load current is the main disadvantage of the 
feedforward loop in [8]. For low-cost DSP-based 
system, implementation of the 
proportional-plus-integral-type (PI-type) controller in 
DSP-based environment needs more instructions than 
the proportional-type (P-type) controller. For digital 
integrated circuits, more circuits like “state machine” 
must be designed to implement PI-type controller than 
P-type controller. It implies that PI-type controllers are 
not suitable in low-cost digital control system. 
The proposed PFFC consists of economical P-type 
feedback controller and the phase feedforward loop. 
Because the proposed phase feedforward loop can be 
simply implemented by the actions of looking-up table, 
the proposed PFFC can be referred to as one solution of 
high-switching-frequency PFC function implemented 
in the low-cost DSP-based system or digital integrated 
circuits. It is noted that the phase feedforward signal in 
PFFC is not to change the nominal pattern of duty ratio 
but to shift it. The larger the current magnitude is, the 
more the shifting phase of the nominal duty ratio 
pattern is. 
 
II. CONVENTIONAL FEEDFORWARD CONTROL 
A. Boost-Type SMR 
Power circuit configuration of a boost-type SMR is 
shown in Fig. 1. The circuit mainly consists of a diode 
bridge rectifier and a boost-type DC/DC converter. To 
simply the following theoretical analysis, some 
assumptions are made: 
(i) the constituted circuit components in Fig. 1 are 
lossless; (ii) the circuit includes a reasonably bulk 
capacitor ; d
(iii) the switch SW operates at infinity switching 
frequency;

From (7), we can find that the control feedforward

D. P-Type Current Feedback Controller 
After applying the command feedforward loop in 
previous section, the tracking error due to disturbance 
in Fig. 3 can be greatly reduced and thus the simple 
P-type feedback controller pci  can be used to 
yield satisfactory control performance. Then, the 
closed-loop transfer function  for inductor 
current can be derived from Fig. 4 to be

From (11), we can find that the SMR behaves like the 
pure resistor when input line frequency in  is further 
smaller than the cut-off frequency c . It implies that 
the desired PFC function can be simply obtained by 
increasing  (i.e. by increasing P-type parameter 
).

However, too large gain in practical control system 
would contribute to instability. In the design of 
feedback control gain, two key issues are additionally 
considered: (i) the current command  is a rectified 
sine signal with double line frequency in ; (ii) since 
the operation stability of a ramp-comparison PWM 
scheme is much affected by the P-type parameter p , 
a general criterion to determine the parameter is that 
the closed-loop cut-off frequency  must be less 
than the half of switching frequency tri . In order 
to yield satisfactory current tracking switching control 
performance without sacrificing the switching 
operation stability, the frequency c  with the 
conventional feedforward loop in (9) must be located at 
the range:

III. PROPOSED PHASE FEEDFORWARD CONTROL 
Fig. 5 shows the proposed phase feedforward control 
(PFFC) for boost-type SMRs where its inner current 
controller is composed of a P-type feedback controller 
and a phase feedforward loop. From Fig. 5, the

In first, we can obviously find the current waveforms 
are improved through including both feedforward loops 
by comparing Fig. 7(a) with Fig. 7(b)-(c). However, 
negligible difference between the input current 
waveforms in Fig. 7(b) and in 7(c) can be found. Thus, 
for , the response with conventional 
feedforward loop is much close to the response with 
the proposed phase feedforward loop which also 
demonstrates that (9) will approximately become (11) 
when the closed-loop cut-frequency is far larger than 
the line frequency .

In addition, the simulated waveforms for closed-loop 
cut-frequency  are shown in Fig. 8. With 
comparison between Fig. 8(b) and Fig. 8(c), obvious 
current drops at zero-crossing points can be found in 
Fig. 8(b). Such current drops can not only contribute to 
the high harmonic currents but also result in additional 
power loss due to hard-switching of diode. It means 
that P-type current controller  with 
conventional feedforward loop may not yield pure sine 
current waveforms when the closed-loop cut-frequency 
c  is close to the line frequency in  (i.e. when p  
is small). Furthermore, from Fig. 7(c) and Fig. 8(c), the 
current responses can be seen as identical to each other 
for various p  which also demonstrates the pure 
response in (21). Thus, in order to obtain the desired 
current responses, small P-type parameter p  can be 
used in the proposed PFFC which will increase the 
overall system stability.

Besides, the input harmonic currents of Fig. 8(b) and

that the current waveform in Fig. 8(b) with 
conventional feedforward loop possesses higher 
harmonic currents than that in Fig. 8(c) with proposed 
phase feedforward loop under the same P-type 
parameter 0597.0=pK .

V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
The proposed PFFC has been digitally implemented 
in a DSP-based system using TMS320F240 where 
PI-type voltage controller  is used. In 
performing the digital control, the sampling 
frequencies set for the current loop and voltage loop 
are 25kHz and 1kHz, respectively. In the hardware 
implementation, the component values are the same as 
listed in Table I where the output power is near 625W. 
Some measured results are provided for demonstrating 
the control performances of the designed PFFC.

By setting closed-loop cut-frequency kHzfc 5=  
and 597.0=pK , the measured input currents in  
with conventional feedforward loop and with proposed 
phase feedforward loop are plotted in Fig. 10(a) and 
10(b), respectively. From Fig. 10, both feedforward 
loops can be seen as yielding the desired response.
