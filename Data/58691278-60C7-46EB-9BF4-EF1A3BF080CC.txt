Finite-Volume Method 
A finite volume method used to discretize 
the momentum equation on a cell-centered 
unstructured Cartesian grid system.  The 
variable states at the cell faces are linearly 
reconstructed from the center values.  The 
convective fluxes are upwind oriented based on 
the velocity at the cell face.  The pressure 
force is computed using the reconstructed 
pressure state at the cell face, while the viscous 
fluxes are computed using the velocity 
gradients at the cell face.  Overall, a second 
order accurate upwind difference scheme is 
used for the convective fluxes and central 
difference schemes are used for the pressure 
and viscous fluxes.  To compute the 
divergence of velocity, a normal face velocity is 
defined separately from the cell center velocity.

(2) Direct-Forcing Immersed Boundary 
Method (DFIBM) 
Although the above reconstruction model 
is developed in the frame work of ghost cell 
method, but it can be adapted by a 
direct-forcing immersed boundary method, 
where the target point of the direct forcing is 
the first fluid cell center adjacent to the 
immersed surface.  The target cell is named 
Forcing cell in Fig. 2, and its variable values 
are responsible for the correct boundary 
conditions simulating the immersed body 
surface.   The projection point (Proj-F) and 
the image point (Image-F) of the forcing point 
are also shown.  The projection point is on the 
immersed surface, and the image point is in the 
fluid side at a normal distance δ  away from 
the projection point.  Here, we take 
minx∆= 2δ  to ensure that the estimation of

where Forcingr

the immersed surface, respectively. 
It is clear that the same flow reconstruction 
model has been applied in ghost cell method 
and the direct-forcing immersed boundary 
method.  Interpolation is used in the ghost cell 
method while extrapolation is used in 
direct-forcing immersed boundary method.  
The variable values specified at ghost cells or 
forcing cells are aiming to simulate the 
boundary conditions that should occur on the 
nearby immersed surface.  The difference 
between the two methods is solely caused by 
the difference in the grid cells receiving the 
artificial forcing.  Because that the ghost cells 
and the forcing cells are located on the opposite 
side of the immersed body surface, their values 
have direct impacts on the boundary layer flow.  
In ghost cell method, all fluid cells are solved 
by the governing conservation laws, but in 
direct-forcing immersed boundary method, the 
forcing cells inside the boundary layer are 
artificially determined.  This surely will create 
some differences in the flow solution, which 
deserves further investigations. 
 
Convergence Test 
A lid-driven cavity flow with an immersed 
cylinder of at the center is computed to verify 
the spatial accuracy of the current method.  
Figure 3 shows the schematic of the flow.  
The length of the square cavity is unity and the 
cylinder diameter is 0.25.  The upper wall of 
the cavity moves toward right at a unit speed.  
The Reynolds number based on the cavity 
length, upper wall speed and the fluid viscosity 
∑∑ ∆∆= surface local
surface
avg SNuS
Nu 1  (9) 
where S∆  is the area of a surface segment, 
the local Nusselt number localNu  at the 
segment center is obtained by bilinear 
interpolation and bilinear difference 
approximation, the summation is done on all 
boundary surface segments of the body.   
For the Re=20 case computed by Ghost 
Cell method, Fig. 8 shows the temperature 
contours with an increment of 0.05 computed 
by three types of temperature boundary 
condition.  The temperature distributions are 
similar but the magnitudes are different.  
Figure 9 shows the local Nusselt distribution on 
the cylinder surface with some published data 
from Zhang et al. [12].  Generally the localNu  
distribution is highest at the front stagnation 
and lowest at the rear stagnation.   
Table 1 lists results by Ghost Cell Method 
and Direct Forcing Method computed on the 
same grid (L2-refined), including the wake 
length (Lw) normalized by the diameter (d), the 
computed lift coefficient (Cl), drag coefficient 
(Cd) and the average Nusselt number ( avgNu ).  
The comparison with the work of others is 
generally satisfactory.  The difference between 
results obtained by the two method seems very 
small.  However, for the isoflux (Neumann 
BC) case, it is noted that after plotting the local 
localNu  distribution on the cylinder surface, 
some noticeable differences between the two 
methods were shown.  Further grid refinement 
tests indicated that for the Ghost Cell method, 
the local localNu  showed little variation more 
refined grids.  But for the Direct Forcing 
method, the local localNu  gradually converge 
to the result obtained by the Ghost cell method 
on the L2-refined grid, as shown in Fig. 10.  
The convergence of the averaged Nusselt 
number avgNu  corresponding to Fig. 10 is 
shown in Table 2.  Note that differences 
between the two methods generated by the 
Direclet boundary condition on a L2-refined 
grid are generally small.  This indicates that, 
for the Neumann boundary condition, the 
Direct Forcing immersed boundary method is 
less accurate than the Ghost Cell method, 
which is consistent with the order of accuracy 
tests.    
Sudden-Start Circular Cylinder 
To test the capability of the two methods 
to handle moving bodies, the case of an 
impulsively started moving cylinder was 
computed and compared with the experimental 
data by Bouard and Coutanceau [18].  The 2D 
cylinder was initially at rest and suddenly 
moved to the left at a constant speed cylU .  
The Reynolds number based on the cylinder 
diameter D and cylinder speed cylU  is 550.  
The mesh is uniformly refined along the path of 
the cylinder such that the cylinder surface 
intersects about 312 cells.  During the cylinder 
movement, some ghost cells near the rear end 
of the cylinder at time level n will change to 
fluid cells at time level n+1.  For these fresh 
fluid cells, the body velocity nBv
v  at time level 
n, not the ghost cell velocity nghostv
v  obtained by 
extrapolation, is used as the starting condition 
for time integration.  Also, nBv
v  instead of the 
extrapolated nghostv
v  is used to compute the 
divergence of velocity field.  This step is 
essential for the Ghost Cell method to suppress 
the oscillation in pressure force evaluation.  
As for the Direct Forcing immersed boundary 
method, no such treatment is needed since the 
interpolated velocity at the forcing points yield 
smooth distribution of divergence field.  
The time integration is performed for 600 
steps at a constant time increment.  At the end 
of computation, the cylinder has moved three 
diameters away from its initial position.  For 
the Ghost Cell Method, Fig. 11 shows the time 
dependent development of velocity along the 
symmetry axis in the wake.  In this figure the 
velocity u was measured relative to the moving 
cylinder and normalized by the cylinder speed 
cylU .  The distance x/D along the symmetry 
axis was referenced relative to the cylinder 
center.  The symbols in Fig. 11 are measured 
manually from the experimental points in 
Bouard and Coutanceau [18], while the lines 
are from our computation.  Different symbols 
correspond to different time D/tUt cyl
* =  
with an increment of 0.5, starting from 
50.t* = .  The agreement between 
computation and experiment is generally 
integrations have less oscillation in these 
figures than those in the results obtained by 
ghost cell method.  This may be considered as 
one of the advantages using the Direct Forcing 
immersed boundary method.

Conclusions 
  This project has developed successfully a 
flow reconstruction model suitable for Ghost 
Cell method as well as the Direct Forcing 
immersed boundary method.  The 2-point 
model can be applied to implement Direclet, 
Neumann and Robin boundary condition for 
velocity, temperature and pressure.  The order 
of accuracy of the solution verified using lid 
driven cavity flow with a circular cylinder at 
the center is 2nd order accurate for all norms for 
Direclet boundary condition, but drop to about 
1.4 order accuracy in maximum norm for 
Neumann or Robin boundary condition.   
Tests on flow fields with moving bodies 
show that oscillations in pressure force 
calculation may occur.  The oscillation in 
pressure integration is more severe in the Ghost 
Cell method than that in the Direct Forcing 
immersed boundary method.

Micro-mixers
• Passive micromixers?
No moving parts and no flow 
agitations input.
Rely on well-designed 
geometric variations of the 
flow passages to enhance 
mixing.
Easy to manufacture, operate 
and maintain.  Not-so-easy to 
obtain a good design.
• Active micromixers?
Use of controllable moving 
parts or flow agitations input 
to enhance mixing. 
Capable of practicing active 
control to obtain high mixing 
efficiency.
Hard and expensive to design, 
manufacture, operate and 
maintain.
A rapid and sufficient mixing of two or more microfluid flows 
through micromixers is essential to the efficiency of biomedical 
microfluidic chips?

Experimental Results
• Rib separation S has little effect on mixing efficiency 
when Pe < 125.7
• When Pe? 125.7?S=0.4H~0.5H yields maximum 
mixing efficiency for both L90% and L99%
• S=0.5H is a good choice of rib separation.

Conclusions
• Average rib height Havg and rib separation S are the two major 
parameters affecting mixing efficiency. 
• Rib widthWrib and rib shape factor Hd are less significant.
• When Havg > 0.35H, a nonlinear increase of pressure difference is 
observed.  Havg = 0.35H is a good compromised choice?
• Final choice: Wrib=0.1H?Hd=h2-h1=0?Havg=0.35H?
S=0.5H?
• For Re?1 and Pe?400000?the ribbed T-channel micromixer
requires only a channel length of 30H to ensure a σ=99% mixing 
state at the channel exit.  
• This design has alleviated the limitation set by the linear 
relationship between L99% and Peclet number Pe at low Re 
regime.
