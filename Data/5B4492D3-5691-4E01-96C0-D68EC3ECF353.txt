本架構使用非破壞性的量測方法，針對市面上目前使用酒精比重計
量測酒精濃度，其精密度約 1%左右，因此本文利用光學元件達配
光路徑的設計，延伸出量測酒精濃度的架構，由結果中可知道酒精
濃度-折射率關係圖，了解其趨勢走向；另一方面，針對關係圖做
誤差分析，其平均折射率約 0.006758，其原因為光入射至待測物
時，入射光跟待測物表面是否有呈現垂直狀，會影響折射偏角。但
在多次的光學通過待測物會影響其準確度。技術說明

1995 年 Franco Docchio. [3]等人利用四像儀量測液體折射率，此架構使用 PSD 可
穫得電壓和雷射的位移數據，並透過公式得到實驗數據，故 PSD 精密度不高。

五、 結果與討論(含結論跟建議)
5.1 結果
 本實驗使用石英槽，取旋轉角度最大 5 時，首先需先計算液體內部的厚
度。由架構中，先量測到空石英槽之光程差為 mEL 7.90  ，經加入液體水
之後，所量測到的 mELwater 5.28 ，兩者相減之後，代入數學解析中，可得
到石英槽內部厚度為 md w 27.9960 。
 本架構中，所使用之液體為不同酒精濃度(乙醇和去離子水調配)，其代入厚
度為 md w 27.9960 ，室溫控制為 C20 ，將所調配好之酒精進行折射率換
算，可得到表 1：

根據以上量測到數據，繪出其濃度-折射率圖示，如圖 3：
左右兩側，當旋轉角度時，因石英槽與入射光路沒有完全呈垂直，因此會造成 d
值有些許誤差，當濃度愈高其對折射率的影響就愈大，但其趨勢走向差異不大。

that offer the substantial pharmacological and antioxidant
properties [9]. Flavonoids compounds have anti-oxidation
properties in that they remove free radicals, reduce blood
pressure and reduce vessel thrombosis. In addition, the caffeic
acid phenethyl ester of Propolis also has anti-cancer[10], virus
inhibiting, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and hypoxic brain
injury prevention properties.
Some common Propolis extraction methods are the
ethanol extraction method, back extraction method and acetone
extraction method. The ethanol method is relatively simple, and
doesn’t require a high operating temperature.Although there is
some volatile activity and the effective loss of flavonoids is not
easy to control, the limited extraction time reduces these effects
[11]. Back extraction takes less time and the extraction rate rises
with a rise in temperature, however, with an increase in
temperature some of the active components or flavonoids can
be destroyed. The acetone method uses a solution of 70%
acetone to 30% water to extract flavonoids. Although this is a
very effective method it is not common because of the more
expensive price of the solvent and is not used in food
production because the process leaves a residual solvent.
This experiment will compare the extraction methods of the
major components of propolis. Specifically it will explore the
efficacy of various MAE conditions on the concentrations of
ingredients within an extract.
II. METHOD OF EXPERIMENT
This experiment uses microwave energy to speed up the
rotation and vibration of the polar molecules (water-soluble
components) of a base material. This process further accelerates
the solvent’s ability to quickly dissolve in the solution. 
Together these properties increase the extraction rate. The
process also involves an accurate temperature control of the
circulatory system in order to avoid destruction of active
ingredients. The process is further enhanced by a mechanical
shearing module which uses physical force to fracture the plant
fiber’s cel wals. This speeds up the dissolution of the cels’ 
active ingredients within the solution. The double affect
obtained by the use of microwave energy in combination with a
shearing mechanism, significantly increases the efficiency of
the mixing of non-polar and polar components during the
extraction process.

C. Structure of Extraction System
This experiment used an extraction system of three main
modules, including 1 Microwave Module 2 Shear Module
3 Temperature Control Module. Its functions are as follows:
1 Microwave Module: This includes a magnetron
capable of producing microwaves of 2450 MHz at a maximum
of 800 Watts. Through this process electrical energy produces
microwaves in the magnetron which are then focus on the metal
wall of the furnace. These microwaves are then reflected within
the metal chamber and evenly heat the extract and solvents to
the required temperature. Using glass vessels, that do not
restrict microwave penetration, allows polar molecular rotation,
vibration and molecular inter collision to further speed up the
extraction effect.
2 Shear Module: This motor-driven component uses a
moving Shear Module. It is comprised of an internal moving
rotor, and a fixed external stator, as show in Figure 2. The
difference in speed between the fixed stator and spinning rotor
create a great shear. In addition to making the solution more
uniform it also generate tremendous effect on the flow. This
further increases the extraction speed. An additional benefit is
that the rotor generated flow field makes the microwave
generated heat more evenly distributed throughout the solution.
A uniform temperature throughout the mixture means a more
accurate temperature control.
3 Temperature Control Module: This module consists of
a back flow tube, a circulation pump and a temperature sensor.
The temperature sensors on the tube transmit a signal to the
computer control module. This information is then used to
determine the requisite circulation pump flow speed. Signals to
either increase or decrease the flow, so that the extract and
solution maintain the required temperature, are then transmitted
by the computer control module.

B. Comparison of Ultrasonic and Microwave extractions
Fig.6-9, show that sample no.2 generated a higher
concentration of active ingredients than sample no.1. However,
the component of CAPE in samples no.3-4 and no.5-6 by MAE
process produce a concentration of ingredients that are 1.2 and
2 times greater than the sample no.2 by ultrasonic extraction
process. Also, the time of extraction is 11 times less than sample
no.2. These results illustrates dramatically that MAE process
for extracting CAPE is much more efficiency.
C. The influence of Soaking time on the Active Ingredient
concentration
After being subjected to the same 15-minute MAE process,
our two samples that had been soaked for either 14 days or 12
hours gave the following results respectively: the Artepillin C
concentrations were 0.1123 and 0.0943 mg/ml; the CAPE
concentration were 0.1128 and 0.1784 mg/ml; the Quercetin
concentration were 1.0083 and 0.7282 mg/ml, the Rutin
concentration were 0.0285 and 0.011 mg/ml. Other than the
results for CAPE, the remaining ingredients which were soaked
for 14 days indicated a higher concentration of extract. A longer
soaking time before processing for the extraction of the active
ingredients in most cases has a positive impact on the
concentration levels.
As shown in Figure 7, after being soaked for 14 days the
MAE process actually results in a lower concentration of CAPE
than that of the sample that was only soaked for 12 hours. These
results might be explained by the break down and dissolution of
CAPE during a longer soaking time. This illustrates that the
process component extraction requires a careful consideration
of the soaking times which are dependant on the components
being extracted.
D. The effect of time by MAE for Active Ingredient
concentration
Figure 6, 7, 8, and 9 illustrate the concentrations of
Artepillin C, CAPE, Quercetin and Rutin, respectively. (the
conditions under which each sample was processed are noted in
Figure 3). These results indicate that the duration of the
microwave processing is relevant to the concentrations derived
from samples that are soaked for the same period. This is
particularly evident in the samples that had been saturated for
14 days. The samples that were soaked 12 hours and underwent
a microwave processing of time of either 15 or 30 minutes
produced Artepillin C concentrations of 0.0943 and 0.1268
mg/ml respectively. Of particular note were the results of the
Rutin extractions in the samples that had been soaked for 12
hours. The sample that had a 15 minute microwave processing
produced a concentration of 0.011 and that which had a 30
minute processing produced a concentration of 0.0689 mg/ml.
There is nearly 5 times the difference between the 15 and 30
minutes processing times.
The experiment’s data shows that an extraction time of 15 
and 30 minutes on 12 hour saturation sample produced
difference in the CAPE concentration of 2.8 %. in contrast the
difference between an time extraction of 15 and 30 minutes on a
sample that had been saturated for 14 days produced a smaller
difference of 1.7 % in the CAPE concentration. As there is not a
substantial difference in the results generated by either sample,
this would indicate that the extraction time has little impact of
the CAPE concentrations extracted.

Abstract—This paper studies the bifurcation behavior of the 
probe tip of an atomic force microscope with a 
proportional-plus-derivative (PD) feedback control using the 
DT (differential transformation) method. The dynamic behavior 
of the probe tip with PD control law is characterized by 
reference to maximum Lyapunov exponent plots produced 
using the time-series data obtained from differential 
transformation method. Furthermore, the detailed transitions 
in the dynamic response of the probe tip are examined using 
bifurcation diagrams of the tip displacement and the tip 
velocity, respectively. The results indicate that the probe tip 
behavior is significantly dependent on the magnitude of the 
proportional and derivative control gain. Specifically, the probe 
tip motion includes T-, 2T-, 3T-, 4T-, multi-periodic, and chaotic 
motion. Numerical results show that the dynamic behavior will 
leave chaotic motion to periodic motion at Kp=-0.45 in the 
steady state by changing the control loop gain Kv from -0.1 to 
-1.0. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the differential 
transformation method is in good agreement for the considered 
system. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
HE atomic force microscope (AFM) provides a powerful 
tool for surface analysis applications in the 
nano-electronics, materials and biotechnology fields. During 
operation, intermolecular forces between the AFM probe tip 
and the sample surface cause a deflection of the 
microcantilever on which the probe tip is mounted. The 
variation in force acting on the tip is then evaluated by using 
some form of optical technique to measure the deflection of 
the cantilever. 
The nonlinear dynamic behavior of an AFM system is a 
major concern since any irregular motion of the AFM probe 
tip inevitably degrades the precision of the measurement 
results. Burnham et al. [1], [2] showed that the

microcantilever of an AFM performed chaotic motion under 
specific physical conditions. Ashhab et al. [3] modeled the 
microcantilever of an AFM using a single-frequency mode 
approximation and analyzed the chaotic dynamics of the 
cantilever-sample system using the Melnikov method. Lee et 
al. [4] analyzed the effects of van der Waals and 
Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov forces on the tip-sample 
interactions induced in dynamic force microscopy (DFM). 
The authors also presented detailed experimental results 
which provided valuable new perspectives and insights into 
DFM. Ruetzel et al. [5] applied the Galerkin method to 
investigate the nonlinear dynamics of an AFM probe tip 
under the assumption that the tip-surface interactions were 
governed by Lennard-Jones potentials. Based upon their 
analysis, the authors showed that the probe tip exhibited a 
broad range of dynamic phenomena, including both periodic 
and chaotic motion. 
However, none of the studies reviewed above presented 
phase portraits, power spectra, Poincaré maps, maximum 
Lyapunov exponent plots or bifurcation diagrams to confirm 
the validity of their predictions for the AFM behavior or use a 
PD (proportional-plus-derivative) feedback to control the 
chaotic motion observed in the AFM system. Accordingly, 
the present study investigates the dynamic behavior of an 
AFM probe tip using two numerical methods, namely the 
differential transformation method [6], [7] and the 
Runge-Kutta method and then characterizes the dynamic 
response of the system by reference to phase portraits, power 
spectra, Poincaré maps, and maximum Lyapunov exponent 
plots. Finally, the chaotic behavior in the AFM system is 
identified using bifurcation diagrams of the tip displacement 
and tip velocity, respectively and a PD controller included 
proportional gain and derivative gain is applied to control this 
system.  
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section 2 presents a mathematical model for the 
time-dependent motions of the microcantilever tip and 
describes the solution of this model using the differential 
transformation method. Section 3 compares and contrasts the 
numerical results obtained by the differential transformation 
method and the Runge-Kutta method for the dynamic 
response of the microcantilever tip at various proportional 
gains and derivative gains. Subsequently, the nonlinear 
dynamic behavior of the probe tip is analyzed by maximum 
Lyapunov exponent plots and bifurcation diagrams, 
respectively. Finally, Section 4 draws some brief conclusions.

B. Situation 1 
In the first situation, the bifurcation parameter was chosen 
to be the Kp, and Kv=0. In the current study, Figs. 1 plot the 
bifurcation diagrams of the tip displacement and the tip 
velocity, respectively, taking Kp as the bifurcation parameter. 
Finally, Figs. 2(a)-2(f) present the maximum Lyapunov 
exponent of the microcantilever tip trajectory at Kp = -0.5, 
-0.47, -0.39, -0.32, -0.22, -0.21, -0.08 and -0.05, respectively.  
Figs 1(a)(b) and 2(a) show that at lower values of Kp, i.e. Kp 
<-0.47, the displacement (X1) and velocity (X2) of the tip both 
exhibit a dynamic periodic response. As Kp is increased from 
-0.47 to -0.41, Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) show that both the tip 
displacement and the tip velocity perform chaotic motions. 
Fig. 2(b) presents the maximum Lyapunov exponent at Kp = 
-0.47 and proof the appearance of chaos. At Kp = -0.4, the 
chaotic motion is replaced by multi-subharmonic motion, as 
shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). When Kp is increased over the 
interval -0.4≤Kp<-0.32, the tip response includes both 
multi-subharmonic and 4T-subharmonic motion. Fig. 2(c) 
presents the maximum Lyapunov exponent at Kp =-0.39(4T). 
However, at Kp =-0.32, the 4T-periodic motion is replaced by 
chaotic motion, as shown in Fig. 2(d). Thereafter, the chaotic 
motion changes its unstable state at Kp =-0.22 and is replaced 
by multi-subharmonic motion. In the range -0.22≤ Kp <0.1, 
Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) show that both the tip displacement and 
the tip velocity perform 4 kinds of motions including T-, 3T-, 
4T-, and multi-subharmonic motions. Figs. 2(e)-2(h) present 
the maximum Lyapunov exponent corresponding to Kp = 
-0.22, -0.21, -0.08 and -0.05, and the maps confirm the 
existence of multi-, 4T-, 3T-subharmonic and T-periodic 
behavior shown in the bifurcation diagrams.  
From the discussions above, it is clear that the dynamic 
response of the probe tip depends on the magnitude of Kp. The 
various motions performed by the tip as Kp increases from -2 
to 0.1 are summarized in Table 3.

D. Situation 3 
In order to analyze that the influence of both Kp and Kv, the 
case is restricted Kp ＜1 and Kv ＜A4 . Also, the PD feedback 
is used to control this system to avoid the chaotic motion 
appear. The bifurcation parameter was chosen to be the Kv at 
Kp =-0.45. 
Figs. 5(a)(b) and 6(a) show that at lower values of Kv, i.e. 
Kv <-0.1, the displacement (X1) and velocity (X2) of the tip 
both exhibit a dynamic periodic response. At Kv = -0.1, the 
T-periodic motion is replaced by chaotic motion, as shown in 
Figs. 5 and 6(b). When Kv is increased over the interval -0.1≤ 
Kv <0.13, the tip response is chaotic motion. Figs. 6(c) and 
6(d) present the maximum Lyapunov exponent at Kv = 0 and 
0.02, respectively.

It is known that if the tip of the AFM system operates in the 
state of aperiodic motion, the resulting broadband vibration 
with large amplitude will lead to a higher probability of 
fatigue failure of microcantilever and decrease the measure 
accuracy of the AFM system. At Kp =-0.45 and Kv =-0.1, the 
maximum Lyapunov exponent is positive and Poincaré map 
demonstrated a fractal structure. It shows that the trajectory of 
the tip displacement is in a state of chaos. In order to 
eliminate the system operating in a no synchronous motion, a 
decreased derivative gain Kv =-0.1 is applied to control this 
system. From Fig. 7, it can be seen that the tip dynamics leave 
the disorder state and turns to a periodic motion in the steady 
state after the derivative gain changes from -0.1 to -1.0.
