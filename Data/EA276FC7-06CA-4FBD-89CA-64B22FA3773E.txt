ABSTRACT 
 
The study presents an analysis on the external costs produced by freight transportation and the 
policies to reduce the external costs. The “polluter-pays” principle advocates that the freight 
sector should be responsible for the external costs they produced. Making use of 
transportation modes with less negative effects, multimodal transportation has been 
demonstrated to be an economic and sustainable strategy for freight transport. In this study, a 
multimodal transportation network model for container flow is developed to estimate the 
inland container movement and the associated external costs. Policy sensitive factors, 
including external cost internalization and cross-subsidization, are simulated. Based on a case 
study with the Taiwan network, our result shows that a high internalization ratio of external 
cost is needed for the modal choice to have a significant shift. With cross-subsidization and 
improvement of port operations, a lower internalization ratio can achieve the same results, 
which could be more politically acceptable.  
 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
The “polluter-pays” principle advocates that the transport sector should be responsible for the 
external costs they produced (Maibach et al., 2007). The external costs of transport consists of 
environmental costs (emissions, pollutions and climate change), congestion costs (travel delay 
to the other travellers), accident costs and infrastructure costs (road construction and 
maintenances) etc. Among the freight transportation modes, truck traffic on highways is the 
major source of negative effects to the environment, and there are many studies on the 
estimation of the external costs produced by urban freight transport (Mayeres et al., 1996; 
Ozbay et al., 2007; Berechman, 2009). Some consider different policies to internalize the 
external costs to the transport sector (Piecyk and McKinnon, 2007).  
 
With the growing importance of logistic in a green and environmental friendly way, 
multimodal transportation has been recognized as an economic and sustainable strategy for 
freight transport. Whereas most of the cargos are carried by trucks, short sea shipping (SSS) 
has been widely discussed in Europe and America as a way to migrate the traffic of cargoes 
from the road network to the sea. Trucks cause traffic congestion problems and produce 
emissions and air pollutants harmful to the residents. Boats and trains have less negative 
environmental effects, but they are not seen as a real alternative because of their low 
flexibility and longer transit time. To achieve a sustainable transport network and motivate 
modal shift, a proper and practical pricing policy is necessary to reflect the external costs 
generated by the infrastructure users.

The environmental costs of international vessels are excluded here because currently there is 
no international regulation applied to the fuel consumption or emissions from shipping. The 
CO2 emissions from international shipping are also not covered by the Kyoto Protocol on 
climate change.

3. STRATEGIES IN REDUCTION OF EXTERNAL COSTS 
 
The reduction of external costs and emissions produced by freight movement is one of the 
primary objectives of the government to improve the transportation network. In an 
environmental perspective, the “polluter-pays” principle is the environmental policy receiving 
strong supports from US and European countries. In European Union, the Eurovignette 
Directive, which is the first EU law to implement wider strategy of internalizing the external 
costs of transportation, has granted the member countries the authority to set road tolls for 
heavy goods vehicles (Liepe et al., 2011; Maibach et al., 2007). 
 
On the other hand, an argument against the external cost charges is that the tax collected from 
the freight industry may not necessary be used to invest in the transport network. There is no 
 7 
each TEU-km on average. However, the amount of congestion cost is highly dependent on the 
traffic conditions (e.g. peak vs. off-peak of traffic), vehicle compositions, and the value of 
time of drivers (Mayeres et al., 1996; Forkenbrock, 1999). For more accurate estimation of 
external congestion cost, a more detailed model and calibration against traffic data are 
necessary. 
 
4.2 Base case 
 
The multimodal transportation network model is solved with the commercial package CPLEX 
11.2 using the AMPL interface (Fourer et al., 2002). The multimodal transportation network 
model is a linear integer programming problem for constant link travel costs. However, if a 
calibrated link cost functions are available, the transportation network model can be extended 
with a traffic assignment model for road traffic and thus nonlinear (Yamada et al., 2009). As 
the amount of freight flow is relatively small to the car traffic, the link costs are usually 
assumed to be constant in the modelling of freight transport. 
 
The base case is run and internalization of external costs is not considered, and the result is 
shown in Table 1. The amount of truck and SSS flows are obtained from the model. All 
containers from or to foreign countries are transported to the ports and then to the cities using 
trucks for the minimum costs, and SSS is not used. The costs of air pollution and CO2 
emissions are estimated to be 543.5 and 11.6 million US dollars respectively.  
 
Real data from the port authority and Lee et al. (2010) also mentioned that there is a certain 
amount of containers between the three seaports, with 862,164 TEU using trucks and 90,701 
via SSS. This is not included in the import/export dataset used to solve the multimodal 
transportation network model, which is deterministic and returns an all-or-nothing flow 
between each origin and destination pair. These numbers are also included in the table for 
comparison. In total, the costs of air pollution and CO2 emissions produced by transportation 
of containers are estimated to be 626.3 and 13.5 million US dollars respectively.  
 
4.3 Internalization of external costs 
 
If the external cost is internalized to the freight sectors and they are responsible for part of the 
environmental cost produced, some of the flows may switch to their path and move via SSS. 
The decision of path switching depends on amount of external costs to be charged and the 
difference of total transportation costs between the paths, and therefore hinge on the origin 
and destination of the trip.   
 
Table 2 shows the change in tuck traffic and short sea shipping traffic against the level of 
internalization. As the level of internalization increases, the trucking freight cost increases 
over the intermodal option between some origin and destination pairs, and there is a modal 
shift from trucking between some port and cities to the SSS with trucking. As a result, the 
total transportation costs increase but the associated environmental costs produced decrease.  
 
 
 
 9 
4.4 A model of cross-subsidization 
 
Solely charge on the freight sector may raise huge resistance and opposition. The experiences 
from urban transport pricing show that, to achieve support from the public, the generated 
revenue must be allocated at an efficient manner considering equity of different groups. We 
prefer to see a change in the traffic pattern, but not a change in the total transportation demand, 
as the amount of demand is highly related to the economic development of the country. As 
suggested in Berechman (2009), promotion (such as subsidization) of short sea shipping 
operations, railway expansion, and efficient pricing to trucks are possible solutions to mitigate 
the truck traffic problems. As the strategic objective of the charging is transport sustainability, 
cross-subsidization to sea transport from road transport can make the mechanism more 
practically feasible. 
 
We propose a port cost reduction scenario here. We estimate that maximum differences in 
transit time and costs between dedicated and non-dedicated services are $3500 TWD per TEU 
and 12 hrs respectively. Therefore, we model that the government may subsidize the port 
authorities and port operators to lower the port costs for using the SSS service. We would 
investigate how the level of port cost reduction can work with the external cost internalization 
to maximize the sustainability. 
 
We performed a number of cases with port cost reduction level and internalization ratio. 
Table 3 shows the amount of SSS based on the combined effect of port cost reduction and 
external cost internalization. Recall that, without any port cost reduction, 757,265 TEU of 
containers will use SSS at an internalization ratio of 0.6. 
 
If the port cost is reduced by 10%, the same level of SSS flow can be achieved with the 
internalization ratio of 0.4. If the port cost is reduced by 20%, the same level of SSS flow can 
be achieved with the internalization ratio of 0.1. It is a trade-off between the two policy 
variables considered to achieve the optimal situation. With a smaller internalization ratio, the 
impact to the transport sector is reduced and it should be more acceptable to the industry.
