英 文 摘 要 ： Enhancing electroluminescence of conventional MEH-PPV 
{poly[2-methoxy-5-(2 ‘-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene 
vinylene]} is desirable due to its popularity in 
polymeric emitting materials. Three copolyfluorenes 
(P1-P3) containing bipolar groups (M1 moieties) 
(3.1~11.2 mol%) in the main chain, directly linked 
hole-transporting triphenylamine and electron-
transporting 1,2,4-triazole, are synthesized by 
Suzuki coupling reaction. The bipolar groups not only 
suppress undesirable green emission of polyfluorene 
under thermal annealing, but also increase hole- and 
electron-affinity of the resulting copolyfluorenes. 
Blending the bipolar copolyfluorenes with MEH-PPV 
effectively improve the emission efficiency of its 
electroluminescent devices [ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer 
blend/Ca(50 nm)/Al(100 nm)].  
In chapter 5, a novel bipolar monomer was designed 
and synthesized to prepare three copolyfluorenes (P4-
P6) containing 2.1-8.2 mol% pendant bipolar groups 
(M2 moieties). Blending bipolar model compound Ma 
with MEH-PPV results in enhancement of device 
performance. Maximum luminance and luminance 
efficiency were increased to 6830 cd/m2 and 0.50 
cd/A. Moreover, simple blending the bipolar 
copolyfluorenes with MEH-PPV further improves their 
corresponding device efficiency. 
Furthermore, to enhance electroluminescence of 
another PPV derivative (d6-PPV) two novel copoly(p-
phenylene)s (P7 and P8) containing bipolar groups (M1 
moieties) (12.8 mol% and 6.8 mol%, respectively) were 
synthesized. Blending the bipolar copoly(p-
phenylene)s (P7 and P8) with PPV derivatives (d6-PPV) 
as an emitting layer effectively improve the emission

enhanced up to 11090 cd/m2 and 0.56 cd/A (ca. 0.4 wt% of bipolar residue), respectively. 
Furthermore, to enhance electroluminescence of another PPV derivative (d6-PPV) 
two novel copoly(p-phenylene)s (P7 and P8) containing bipolar groups (M1 moieties) 
(12.8 mol% and 6.8 mol%, respectively), also directly linked hole-transporting 
triphenylamine and electron-transporting aromatic 1,2,4-triazole, were synthesized. 
Blending the bipolar copoly(p-phenylene)s (P7 and P8) with PPV derivatives (d6-PPV) as 
an emitting layer effectively improve the emission efficiency of its corresponding 
electroluminescent devices. Maximum luminance and maximum luminance efficiency 
were significantly enhanced from 310 cd/m2 and 0.03 cd/A (d6-PPV-based device) to 
1450 cd/m2 and 0.20 cd/A (blend device with d6-PPV/P7=96/4 containing ca. 0.5 wt% of 
bipolar groups), respectively. 
Finally, a hole-transporting carbazole moiety was introduced into a novel bipolar 
monomer (M3 moieties). Three novel copolyfluorenes (P9-P11) containing pendant 
bipolar groups (2.5~7.7 mol%), directly linked hole-transporting carbazole and 
electron-transporting aromatic 1,2,4-triazole, were synthesized by the Suzuki coupling 
reaction and applied to enhance emission efficiency of polymer light-emitting diodes based 
on conventional MEH-PPV. Blending bipolar copolyfluorenes with MEH-PPV results in 
significant enhancement of device performance. The maximum luminance and luminance 
efficiency were enhanced to 15690 cd/m2 and 0.81 cd/A (blend device with 
MEH-PPV/P11=94/6 containing ca. 0.46 wt% of pendant bipolar moieties), respectively.  
Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the bipolar copolyfluorenes (P1-P6 and 
P9-P11) and bipolar copoly(p-phenylene)s (P7 and P8) in enhancing emission efficiency 
of MEH-PPV and d6-PPV, respectively.

aluminum as one electrode and thermally evaporated semi-transparent gold as the other 
electrode to reduce operating voltage significantly (ca. 12 V).7 In 1983, the discovery of 
EL originated from poly(vinyl carbazole) (PVK) promoted the search for other 
electroluminescent materials containing various ranges of the visual spectrum.8 However, 
the development of electroluminescent organic devices was not successful on account of 
poor device performance. 
In 1987, Tang and Van Slyke reported a double-layer organic light-emitting diode 
(OLED) consisting of 1,1-bis{4-[di(p-tolyl)amino]-phenyl}cyclohexane (triphenylamine 
derivatives) and aluminum tris(8-hydroxyquinolinate) (Alq3) as hole-transporting and 
emitting materials, respectively, sandwiched between transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) 
and an alloy of magnesium and silver (Mg:Ag).9 The OLED device exhibited a luminance 
of over 1000 cd/m2 at a drive voltage of ca. 10 V, an external quantum efficiency of 1% 
and a power efficiency of 1.5 lm/W. Up to now, this device case provided a proper option 
for OLED device derived from thermally evaporated small molecules. In 1990, Holmes 
and coworkers firstly reported the polymeric light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) using 
π-conjugated polymer poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) as an emitting layer between 
metallic electrodes.10 This device (ITO/PPV/Al) showed yellow green emission with  
internal quantum efficiency of less than 0.01%, but this is a great breakthrough for organic 
light-emitting diodes (Figure 1-2). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1-2. Chemical structure of Alq3, PPV and first PLED device structure. 
In 1991, Heeger and coworkers announced a soluble derivative of PPV with dialkoxy 
side chains, namely poly[2-methoxy-5-(2’-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] or 
MEH-PPV, with energy band gap of about 2.2 eV, whose EL emission spectrum is 
red-shifted relative to that of PPV.11 In general, four steps are used to describe the 
mechanism of electroluminescence as shown in Figure 1-3. The carriers (holes and 
electrons) are first injected from anode and cathode respectively, followed by carriers 
transport in emitting layer under an external electric field. Neutral exciton is formed when

1-2-1 Conjugated Electroluminescent Polymers 
Conjugated electroluminescent polymers have been designed, synthesized and their 
optoelectronic characteristics investigated for the last two decades. For instance, the 
structures of poly(p-phenylenevinylene)s (PPVs), poly(p-phenylene)s (PPPs), 
polyfluorenes (PFs) and polythiophenes (PTs) are shown in Figure 1-7. The derivatives of 
PPVs and PFs were widely investigated due to their proper visible emission color, facile 
structural modification, and high emission efficiency.

Several other soluble PPV derivatives with alkyl and alkoxy groups have been 
reported such as BuEH-PPV, BEH-PPV, BCHA-PPV and C1C10-PPV (Figure 1-8), which 
produce films of varying emission colors.16,17 Alkyl substitution provides polymers with 
emission that is blue-shifted relative to alkoxy counterparts of similar dimensions. The 
blue-shifted emission for BuEH-PPV, relative to BEH-PPV, can be explained by the steric 
hindrance from the methylene groups attached to the phenylene rings. The use of two 
different side chains gives a less-ordered and more-soluble polymer. For BEH-PPV, due to 
its symmetric substitution pattern, more efficient packing of the polymer chains reduces the 
solid state PL efficiency (12%, as compared to 21% for MEH-PPV and 62% for 
BuEH-PPV). For BCHA-PPV with bulky side groups effectively separating the conjugated 
chains, its films, show high PL efficiency (53%). As the size of the alkoxy groups increases, 
the EL efficiency passes through a maximum and decreases again. Semiconducting 
properties of the conjugated polymer is diluted by very large substituents, such as in 
BCHA-PPV. The low EL efficiency of BCHA-PPV is attributed to the poor charge 
mobility due to the large interchain distances. For C1C10-PPV, the size of the side groups is 
well balanced, giving rise to an EL efficiency of 2.1% for single-layer device.18 
Polyfluorenes and its derivatives (PFs) were introduced as a prospective blue-emitting 
layer for polymeric light-emitting diodes (PLEDs). They show high thermal stability and 
display high PL efficiencies both in solution and in solid films with emission wavelengths 
primarily in the blue spectral region.19-21 Their photo-stability and thermal stability are also 
found to be better than those of PPVs. PFs contain a rigidly planarized biphenyl structure 
in the fluorene repeating unit, while the remote substitution at C-9 produces less steric 
interaction in the conjugated backbone itself. The first paper based on EL derived from 
poly[2,7-(9,9-dialkylfluorene)]s (Figure 1-9) featured a single-layer device with a turn-on 
voltage of about 10 V.22 
 
Figure 1-9. Chemical structure of polyfluorene with dodecyl chains. 
However, the blue emission originated from polyfluorene is unstable, with the 
appearance of a strong emission band around 530 nm after thermal annealing or during 
device operation. Initially this long wavelength emission band was believed to be due to 
emission from excimers.23 In support of this, absorption and PL studies of polyfluorenes

1-4 Introduction of Bipolar Polymers 
1-4-1 Background of Bipolar Polymers  
The electroluminescence of molecular or polymeric light-emitting devices arises from 
recombination of electron and hole to form as an exciton in the emitting layer and its 
radiative relaxation. A balanced density of charges, which is determined by the charge 
injection from the contacts, the transport properties in the organic layers and their 
recombination rate to produce excitons, is important to maximize the quantum efficiency 
and the luminance of the LED devices.

One effective way to improve the balanced density of charges is to design and 
synthesize new molecules or polymers containing bipolar transport properties. Bipolar 
compound are molecule containing electron-accepting and electron-donating moieties

Jiang et al. synthesized copolymers with bipolar carrier transport abilities through free 
radical copolymerization of N-vinylcarbazole (NVK, hole-transport monomer) with either 
of two substituted styrenes containing oxadiazole groups, which serve as electron transport 
monomers: 2-phenyl-5-{4-[(4-vinylphenyl)methoxy]phenyl}-1,3,4-oxadiazole, PVO, and 
2-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-5-{4-[(4-vinylphenyl)methoxy]phenyl}-1,3,4-oxadiazole, BVO 
(Figure 1-14). Compared with systems where the oxadiazole units are incorporated by 
simply blending a small-molecule oxadiazole into poly(N-vinylcarbazole), the glass 
transition temperatures of these copolymers are high and there is no possibility for the 
oxadiazole units to phase-separate through recrystallization. The glass transition 
temperatures for the copolymers show positive deviations from a harmonic mixing rule,

Zhuang et al. synthesized a highly soluble polyfluorene-based copolymer containing 
electron-rich triphenylamine (TPA) and electron-deficient 
9,9-bis(3,4-bis(3,4-dicyanophenoxy)phenyl side chains in the C-9 position of the fluorene 
unit by Yamamoto polymerization using Ni(COD)2 as catalyst (Figure 1-16). The 
calculated highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), lowest unoccupied molecular 
orbital (LUMO), energy band-gap, ionization potential, and electron affinity were -5.66, 
-3.44, 2.22, 5.92, and 3.70 eV, respectively. The currents in both ON and OFF states did 
not show any degradation, suggesting good device stability. The ON/OFF current ratio 
observed in the sweep I-V characteristics at +1.0 V was 6.1 × 103.59

Liu et al. reported a conjugated copolymer containing TAZ and TPA moieties, 
poly[4-phenyl-3,5-bi(p-vinylenephenyl)-1,2,4-triazole-alt-4,4-bi(p-vinylenephenyl)-p-2’-et
hylhexyloxylphenylamine] (TAZ–TPA–PPV) (Figure 1-19). It can be regarded as the 
conjugated combination of TPA and TAZ moieties and thus simultaneous existence of 
electron and hole affinity in one polymer chain can be expected, because TAZ and TPA 
have been widely used as excellent electron-transporting/hole-blocking materials and 
hole-transporting materials, respectively, in the fabrication of small-molecule EL devices. 
The polymer yielded a bright green-yellow emission and displayed good solubility, 
excellent film-forming ability, and high thermal stability. For the single-layer device, the 
threshold voltage was about 6 V, and a bright green-yellow EL was observed, with 
luminance being 90 cd/m2 at 12 V.62 
 18

Zhang et al. reported a soluble electroluminescent polymer (I) containing 
hole-deficient triphenylamine and electron-deficient oxadiazole units in the main chains 
(Figure 1-21). The molecular design is based on the well-known hole-transporting property 
of triphenylamine group and electron-transporting character of oxadiazole unit. Because of 
the good bipolar transporting performance, the brightness and electroluminescent 
efficiency were significantly improved and the turn-on voltage was reduced, relative to a 
similar polymer without the electron-deficient oxadiazole units in the main chains. Its 
electroluminescent device (ITO/PEDOT/polymer I/CsF/Al) revealed maximum brightness  
3600 cd m-2 and maximum luminance efficiency 0.65 cd A-1 (quantum efficiency of 0.3%), 
about 15 times brighter and 15 times more efficient than the corresponding polymer

An electroluminescent device incorporating this polymer as the emitting layer exhibited a 
stable blue emission with a maximum brightness of 2080 cd/m2 at 12 V and a maximum 
external quantum efficiency of 1.4% at a brightness of 137 cd/m2. Furthermore, atomic 
force microscopy measurements indicated that the dipolar nature of PF-TPAOXD, in 
contrast to the general nonpolarity of polydialkylfluorenes, provided a stabilizing 
environment allowing the polar organometallic triplet dopant to be dispersed 
homogeneously. An electrophosphorescent device using red-emitting osmium complex 
doped PF-TPAOXD as emitting layer realized red emission with CIE coordinates of (0.66, 
0.34). The maximum brightness was 7244 cd/m2 and the maximum external quantum 
efficiency was 7.3% at a brightness of 1747 cd/m2.68

Yuan and coworkers synthesized a blue-light-emitting polyfluorene (PF) derivative 
(PF-CBZ-OXD), characterized by the presence of bulky hole-transporting carbazole and 
electron-transporting oxadiazole pendent groups (Figure 1-26). An EL device based on 
PF-CBZ-OXD was turned on at 4.5 V and exhibited a stable blue emission, with maximum 
external quantum efficiency being 1.1%. Moreover, they used PF-CBZ-OXD and its 
analogue PF-TPA-OXD as hosts which were doped with a red-light-emitting iridium 
 24
much higher quantum efficiency was obtained for a single-layer PLED, which was 
attributed to improved hole-electron recombination. Applying this high triplet The diblock 
copolymers were also used as host doped with a green-emitting complex, external quantum 
efficiency of 5.4% (at 900 cd/m2) was achieved for single-layer PLED.70 
Yeh and coworkers synthesized vinyl copolymers (PCOn), containing pendant 
carbazole and aromatic 1,3,4-oxadiazole attached with dodecyloxy group from their 
corresponding precursor poly(9-vinyl carbazole-co-4-vinylbenzyl chloride) (PCBn) by the 
Williamson condensation (n: mole% of 4-vinylbenzyl chloride) (Figure 1-28). These 
copolymers were used as host materials for green phosphorescent light-emitting diodes 
after blending 4 wt % of Ir(ppy)3. PL spectra of the PCOn films showed the formation of 
excimer or exciplex. The phosphorescent EL devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/host 
copolymers:Ir(ppy)3/BCP/Ca/Al) were fabricated to investigate optoelectronic properties. 
The PL and EL spectra of the blends [PCOn:Ir(ppy)3] revealed dominant green emission at 
517 nm attributed to Ir(ppy)3 due to efficient energy transfer from the host to Ir(ppy)3. 
Efficient green phosphorescent OLEDs were obtained: for instance, maximum luminance 
efficiency and maximum luminance were 17.9 cd/A and 19903 cd/m2, respectively. After 
doped with Ir(ppy)3, the film morphology of PCO20 with attached dodecyloxy groups 
exhibited uniform and featureless image, as investigated by tapping-mode AFM and 
FE-SEM. Accordingly, the high device performance was attributed to good compatibility 
of the host PCO20 with guest Ir(ppy)3.71

The excitation process results in conversion of the molecule to any of the several excited 
vibration states. It is important that a singlet/triplet transition (or the reverse), which also 
involves a change in electronic state, is a significantly less probable event than the 
corresponding singlet/singlet transition.

The rate at which a photon of radiation absorbed is enormous, the process requiring 
on the order of 10-14 to 10-15 s. Relative to the absorption, fluorescence emission occurs at a 
significantly slower rate. The lifetime of the excited state is inversely related to the molar 
absorptivity of the absorption peak corresponding excited process. Thus, for molar 
absorptivities in the range of 103~105, the lifetimes of excited states are 10-7~10-9 s.  
Moreover, an excited molecule can return to its ground state by a combination of 
several mechanistic steps. As shown in Figure 2-2 the straight vertical arrows, two of these 
steps, fluorescence and phosphorescence, involve the emission of a photon of radiation. 
The other deactivation steps, indicated by arrows, are radiationless processes. The favored 
deactivation process of excited state to ground state is the one that minimize the lifetime of 
excited state. Thus if deactivation by fluorescence is rapid with respect to the radiationless 
process, such emission is observed. On the other hand, if a radiationless process path has a 
more favorable rate constant, fluorescence is either absent or less intense. As consequence, 
the average lifetime of an excited triplet state may range from 10-4 to several seconds, as

2-2 Theory of Exciton Formation73 
The physics of spin formation is illustrated in Figure 2-3. Following the injection of 
electrons and holes into the semiconducting organic thin film, the resulting free polarons 
form with complete statistical probability, into singlet and triplet cations and anions 
(denoted S＋－and T＋－, respectively). As these charge-separated states feel their Coulombic 
attraction, they begin to come together, until the electron and hole are located within a 
capture radius (rc(T)) which is a function of the temperature, T. That is, the capture radius 
is defined as 
 
where ε is the permittivity of the organic thin film, kBT is the Boltzmann energy, and q is 
the electronic charge. Once captured, the resulting state is the neutral bound polaron pair, 
or charge transfer (CT) state. 
 
Figure 2-3. Process of exciton formation by both photoluminescence (PL) and 
electroluminescence (EL). 
Up to this point, pair combinations into S and T states must be purely statistical in 
nature. Once the CT states are formed, however, they continue to localize, forming triplet 
and singlet Frenkel excitons. This branching into S and T is rate-dependent, and ultimately 
determines the EL efficiency of the fluorescent medium, since only singlet to ground state 
transitions are radiative due to spin conservation. Note that by using optical pumping, only 
singlets are formed in a fluorescent material, whose recombination leads to PL. The singlet 
 32
2-3 Quantum Yield72 
The quantum yield, or quantum efficiency, for fluorescence or phosphorescence is 
simply the ratio of the number of molecules that luminesce to the total number of excited 
molecules. Thus, the quantum yield is a measure of the efficiency with which absorbed 
light produces some effect. For example, in a chemical photodegradation process, when a 
molecule falls apart after absorbing a light quantum, the quantum yield is the number of 
destroyed molecules divided by the number of photons absorbed by the system. Since not 
all photons are absorbed productively, the typical quantum yield will be less than 1. 
Quantum yields greater than 1 are possible for photo-induced or radiation-induced 
chain reactions, in which a single photon may trigger a long chain of transformations. One 
example is the reaction of hydrogen with chlorine, in which a few hundred molecules of 
hydrochloric acid are typically formed per quantum of blue light absorbed. In optical 
spectroscopy, the quantum yield is the probability that a given quantum state is formed 
from the system initially prepared in some other quantum state. For example, a singlet to 
triplet transition quantum yield is the fraction of molecules that, after being photo-excited 
into a singlet state, cross over to the triplet state. The fluorescence quantum yield is defined 
as the ratio of the number of photons emitted to the number of photons absorbed.  
The fluorescent quantum yield Φ is determined by the relative rate constants for the 
processes by which the lowest excited singlet state is deactivated, namely fluorescence (kf), 
intersystem crossing (ki), external conversion (kec), internal conversion (kic), 
predissociation (kpd), and dissociation (kd). It can be express there relationship as following 
equation. 
=
kf
kf + ki + kec + kic + kpd + kd  
The magnitude of kf , kpd, and kd are mainly dependent upon chemical structure; the 
remaining constants are strongly influenced by environment and to a somewhat lesser 
extent by structure. 
2-4 Emission of Intermolecular Interaction 
From a theoretical study of PPV,74 the red-shift of the emitting peaks was as the result 
of increasing chain length, and the effective conjugation length were theoretically 
estimated to be 10–17 repeat units.75 However, experimental work with oligomer models 
led to the conclusion that the effective conjugation length of PPV in solid state is no larger 
than 7–10 units.76 In the studies of PPV derivatives, the spectral shifts (absorption and/or 
 34
 
Figure 2-5. Spectral shift of TDBC (a) and rod-like arrangements (b) in aggregation. 
The theoretical and experimental investigation of the behavior of excitons in 
molecular aggregates has a long tradition. Early theoretical contribution by T. Förster and 
D. L. Dexter were based on an incoherent rate equation approach.  
Physical dimers are well known in organic molecules, and are formed from a weak 
interaction (i.e. no chemical bonds are formed) between two neighboring molecules. The 
dimerization cause a splitting of the exciton level into a higher and lower lying levels.79 
The optical transitions allowed depend on the orientation of the transition dipoles of the 
constituent molecules, as shown in Figure 2-6. If the dipoles are parallel, transitions to one 
of the levels are forbidden. If the dipoles are not parallel then transitions to both levels are 
allowed. Knox has studied the case of randomly oriented transition dipoles and has found 
that on average the lower-lying level has lower oscillator strength.80

PPV and CN-PPV. 
The exciton favors to release energy via non-radiative process due to the 
intermolecular interaction induced, thus the less quantum efficiency is not unexpected. To 
solve this, the close distance between two polymer chains should be reduced. Introducing 
bulky pendant groups into polymer chain, such as using spiro-functionalized and/or 
hyperbranched polymer, can efficiently reduce interchain interaction (Figure 2-9).84

Some electroluminescent materials generate a new peak only in EL but not PL. The 
electric-field-induced complex was termed “electroplex”. A similar phenomenon has also 
been found in devices with two materials as a binary blend or as a bilayer. Electroplex 
emission is formed by recombination of electrons and holes in acceptor and donor residues, 
respectively. For example, the formation of electroplex can be found in the following 
polymer containing aromatic oxadiazole acceptor and carbazole donor moieties (Figure

A mechanism of excitation transfer which can occur between molecular entities

2-6 Polymerization Procedures for Electroluminescent Polymers  
It is well known that several synthetic procedures for electroluminescent polymers 
have already been developed and reported. Herein, the most common methodologies for 
preparing electroluminescent polymers are described as follows: 
Friedel-Craft Polymerization 
Polymerization based on oxidative coupling reactions was widely used during the 
early stages of conjugated polymeric researches. These reactions are best used with aryl 
and heterocyclic compounds which having electron-rich sites around their ring systems. 
For example, polycondensation of fluorene or substituted thiophenes can be carried out in 
the presence of FeCl3 as the oxidizing agent in chloroform (Figure 2-15). However, the 
molecular weight distributions of the polymers synthesized in this method are usually 
broad. Similar to the direct oxidative polymerization, Lewis acids, such as AlCl3, AlBr3, 
and FeCl3 can promote polymerization.88

McCullough Method 
The McCullough method utilizes bromination at the 2-position of 3-alkylthiophene 
precursors and selective lithiation at the 5-position with lithium diisopropylamine (LDA), 
followed by quenching with MgBr2‧OEt2. The polymerization is catalyzed by a nickel 
catalyst, such as dichloro[1,1’-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]nickel (II) [Ni(dppf)2Cl2]. 
The overall reaction is controlled by the metal site to give stereoregular structure (Figure

Stille Coupling Reaction 
The Stille coupling reaction refers to the palladium-catalyzed coupling between an 
organostannane and an electrophile to form a new C-C bond (Figure 2-19).95 Advantages of 
this method are that organostannanes are insensitive to oxygen or moisture and tolerant to a 
wide variety of functionalities. However, organostannanes are toxic and difficult to purify.

Wittig and Wittig-Horner Reaction 
    The reaction of an alkylidene phosphorane with an aldehyde or ketone to yield alkene 
and a phosphine oxide is called the Wittig reaction (Figure 2-20). By applying triphenyl 
phosphonium salts to couple with aldehyde, the overall reaction yields achieved are 
moderate to high, but the molecular weights are not high (ca. 10000 or less). One drawback 
of this method is the simultaneous production of cis- and trans-isomers. The former can be 
transformed into the trans-isomers by heating in the solvent containing iodine. The 
selectivity of the olefin-forming step can be improved by using phosphonates instead of 
phosphonium salts, namely, Wittig-Horner reaction (Figure 2-21). This variation produces 
almost all trans-alkenes.96

Yamamoto-Type Aryl-Aryl Coupling 
Yamamoto coupling refers to the nickel-promoted C-C coupling through the 
condensation of dihaloaromatic compounds. The most widely used reagents employed for 
the condensation included NiCl2 in the presence of Zn, PPh3, and bipyridine in 
N,N’-dimethylformamide as solvent (Figure 2-24).101 A major advantage of this method is 
the straightforward preparation of the dihalogenated reactants. As compared to the 
FeCl3-catalyzed oxidative polymerization, Yamamoto coupling improves specificity and 
minimizes branching. However, a disadvantage of this method is that catalyst residues may 
be difficult to remove from the product. In addition, these nickel-catalyzed coupling 
reactions are not suitable for the synthesis of alternating copolymers. Recently, the 
nickel-mediated coupling of Yamamoto route102 has been used to prepare a variety of 
fluorene and substituted fluorene homo- and copolymers.19,20,103

2-7 Eye Sensitivity Function, Color Matching Function and Chromaticity 
Diagram104 
The conversion between radiometric units and photometric units is provided by the 
eye sensitivity function, V (λ), shown in Figure 2-25. The eye has its peak sensitivity in the 
green at 555 nm where the eye sensitivity function has a value of unity; i.e., V (555 nm) = 
1. For wavelengths ranging from 390 to 720 nm, the eye sensitivity function is greater than 
10-3. Although the human eye is sensitive to light with wavelengths < 390 nm and > 720 
nm, the sensitivity at these wavelengths is extremely low. The relationship between color 
and wavelength is given in Table 2-1.

Figure 2-26. 1931 CIE color matching functions. 
The perception of colored light can be analyzed in terms of the degree to which the 
light stimulates the three types of cones (red, green, and blue). The degree of stimulation 
allows one to characterize all possible colors. In the following equation, x), y(), and z() 
are dimensionless quantities. The degree of stimulation of the three types of cones is given 
by:

    The chromatic diagram is shown in Figure 2-27. Monochromatic or pure colors are 
found on the perimeter of the chromaticity diagram. White light is found in the center of 
the chromatic diagram. All colors can be characterized in terms of their location of the

(1) Computational studies can be carried out in order to find a starting point for a 
laboratory synthesis  
(2) Computational studies can be used to explore reaction mechanisms and explain 
observations of laboratory reactions  
Computational methods can be mainly divided to two parts: one is molecular 
mechanical methods which bases on Newtonian physics and the other one is quantum 
mechanical methods that bases on quantum mechanics.  
 
 
 
 
In Newtonian physics, any particle may possess any one of a continuum of energy 
values. In quantum physics, the energy is quantized, not continuous. The system can 
accommodate only certain discrete levels of energy, separated by gaps. At very low 
temperatures these energy gaps are much larger than thermal energy, and the system is 
confined to one or just a few of the low-energy states. This is the “discreteness” of the 
quantum energy landscape. As the temperature is increased, more and more states become 
thermally accessible, the “discreteness” becomes less and less important, and the system 
approaches classical behavior. 
The classical force field is based on the empirical results, averaged over a large 
number of molecules. Semi-empirical methods obtain interatomic forces via analytic 
potentials with forms derived from quantum mechanical based bonding orbitals. The 
procedure commonly used for semi-empirical methods is to choose some functional form 
with a set of parameters, and fit the parameters to some database of system properties (for 
instance, bond lengths, energies, vibrational frequencies). 
The software information of computational methods are described as following. 
Empirical Engines (Molecular Mechanics) 
Several widely available programs perform molecular mechanics calculations. The 
major distinctions between these programs are their force-field implementations. Some 
programs provide two or more force-fields. The accuracy of modeled structures and 
properties depends heavily on the choice of energy calculation method. The first decision 
is whether to use molecular mechanics or a quantum chemical method. Given the decision 
to use molecular mechanics, a force-field that is suitable for the type of molecule being

the molecule being computed is not similar enough to the molecules in the database used to 
parameterize the method. Semi-empirical calculations have been most successful in the 
description of organic chemistry, where only a few elements are used extensively and 
molecules are of moderate size. 
 Some of the major semi-empirical methods are listed below, together with the 
programs in which they are available (note that some of these methods have historical 
value rather than modern day utility):  
 Extended Hückel Theory (EHT) - FORTICON8. 
 Complete Neglect of Differential Overlap (CNDO) and enhancements (CNDO/1, 
CNDO/2, CNDO/S, etc.).  
 Intermediate Neglect of Differential Overlap (INDO).  
 Modified INDO (MINDO) and enhancements (MINDO/2, MINDO/2', and MINDO/3) 
- AMPAC (MINDO/3 only).  
 Michael Zerner's INDO (ZINDO) - ZINDO.  
 Modified Neglect of Diatomic Overlap (MNDO) - AMPAC, MOPAC, Gaussian.  
 Austin Model 1 (AM1) - AMPAC, MOPAC, Gaussian.  
 Parametric Method 3 (PM3) - AMPAC, MOPAC, Gaussian.  
 SemiChem Austin Model 1 (SAM1) - AMPAC. Explicitly treats d-orbitals.  
QUANTA and SYBYL provide interfaces to MOPAC that automatically create the 
MOPAC input files and retrieve the output files for analysis. Insight II is similarly 
interfaced to both MOPAC and AMPAC.  
Ab initio Methods: 
The programs used in computational chemistry are based on many different 
quantum-chemical methods that solve the molecular Schrödinger equation associated with 
the molecular Hamiltonian. Methods that do not include empirical or semi-empirical 
parameters in their equations - are derived directly from theoretical principles, with no 
inclusion of experimental data - are generally called ab initio methods. Most of the time, 
this is referring to approximate quantum mechanical calculations. The approximations 
made in these cases, however, are usually mathematical in nature, such as using a simpler 
functional form or getting an approximate solution for a complicated differential equation. 
 Some of the major ab initio programs are listed below:

3. Elemental Analyzer (EA): 
  Samples were analyzed by a Heraus CHN- rapid element analyzer with acetanilide, 
4-nitroaniline, and benzoic acid as standards. 
4. Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC): 
The average molecular weights and polydispersity index (PDI) of polymers were 
determined by gel permeation chromatography (SISC 32; pump: JASCO PU-987; 
UV Detector: JASCO UV-975; Column: Shodex K-802.5, K-803, K-804L, K-805) 
using monodisperse polystyrene (SP2) as standard with CHCl3 as eluent.  
5. Melting Point Apparatus: 
Sample was filled into a KIMAX-51 capillary first and them its melting point 
measured in Fargo MP-2D melt point apparatus. 
6. Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA): 
The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of polymers was performed under nitrogen 
atmosphere at a heating rate of 20 oC/min using a thermal analyzer (Perkin Elmer 
TGA-7). 
7. Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC): 
Differential scanning calorimeter is a thermal technique in which differences in heat 
flow into a substance and a reference are measured as a function of sample 
temperature (Figure 3-1). In this dissertation, the polymers were measured using a 
differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), Perkin-Elmer DSC 7, under nitrogen 
atmosphere at a heating rate of 10oC/min.

gas (N2, Ar) is passed through the same solvent used in the electrochemical cell. This 
step is necessary for solvent with low vapor pressures. The electrode, added to 
enhance conductivity and to minimize double-layer and migration current effects, is 
chosen on the basis of solubility in a given solvent as well as inertness toward the 
electroactive substance and its electrolysis products. The tetraalkylammonium salts 
are the most commonly used nonaqueous electrolytes. Tetrabutylammonium 
tetrafluoroborate (TBATFB) and tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate 
(TBAHFP) are recommended that TBAHFP in acetonitrile has a particularly large 
useful potential range of +3.4 to -2.9 V (vs. SCE). The most common reference 
electrode (RE) systems used in aqueous solutions are Ag/AgCl and the calomel 
electrode. To avoid large junction potentials, the RE solvent should be as close in 
nature as possible to the cell solvent system. Often potentials are calibrated with a 
standard, such as ferrocence or cobaltocene.  
The diagrammatic curves of cyclic voltammetry were measured on BAS CV-50W at 
room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere using indium-tin oxide (ITO) glass as 
working electrode, Ag/AgCl electrode as reference electrode and platinum wire 
electrode as auxiliary electrode, supporting in 0.1 M (n-Bu)4NClO4 in acetonitrile. 
The energy levels were calculated using the ferrocence (FOC) value of -4.8 eV with 
respect to vacuum level, which is defined as zero.

4-1 Introduction 
Since the discovery of the electroluminescence of poly(p-phenylenevinylene) (PPV) 
in 1990,10 a lot of studies have been focused on polymeric light-emitting diodes (PLEDs), 
because of their great potential to be applied in large-area and flexible displays.12 
Polymeric materials are attractive due to their good film-forming properties, feasible 
solution processing techniques via spin-coating and ink-jet printing,13,14 and susceptible to 
structural modification. However, most luminescent conjugated polymers such as 
MEH-PPV, hole injection and transport are more favorable than electron injection and 
transport due to its high LUMO energy level, resulting in the imbalance of rates for 
electron and hole injection and lowering the luminance efficiency of the device.11,107-110 
Balanced and efficient charge injection/transport for both carriers is essential for high 
device efficiency. To improve the charge injection/transport, two approaches have been 
attempted. One is to apply an additional electron injection/transport layer between the 
emitter and cathode and/or a hole transporting layer between the emitter and anode.111-114 
Nevertheless, fabrication of multilayer polymer LEDs is usually a difficult task. From the 
cost-effective point of view, single-layer devices are preferred. Another approach is to 
fabricate single layer LEDs which blend charge injection/transport molecules such as 
oxadiazole, triazole, triphenylamine or carbazole derivatives. However, these kind of small 
molecules usually have low glass transition temperature (Tg) that causes crystallization and 
thermal breakdown during device operation.28-30 Therefore, the development of charge 
injection/transport materials with high Tg is very important to enhance device performance. 
To overcome the above problems, several research groups reported the polymers contain 
electron- and/or hole-transporting groups with high Tg for improving device 
performance.13(b),31,70,115-119 Jiang et al. synthesized copolymers with hole and electron 
transport groups to improve single-layer dye-doped device performance with an external 
quantum efficiency of 0.4%.31 Greczmiel et al. synthesized polymethacrylates with pendant 
oxadiazole units for improving device performance.115 Bellmann et al. synthesized high-Tg 
hole transporting polymers to improve device performance with a luminance of up to 3700 
cd/m2 and an external quantum efficiency of up to 1.25%.117 Alam et al. synthesized 
polybenzobisazoles containing electron transport groups to improve the performance of 
PPV-based devices with a luminance of up to 1400 cd/m2 and an external quantum 
efficiency of up to 2.5%.118 (a) 
Among the typical conjugated polymers, fluorene-based copolymers show good 
thermal stability20,101,120-122 with high Tg and the emission spectrum of polyfluorene 
overlaps partially with the absorption spectrum of MEH-PPV to facilitate energy transfer 
 90
PEDOT:PSS layer from a polymer solution in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (10 mg/ml). Finally, 
calcium and aluminum were consecutively vacuum-deposited as cathode using a vacuum 
coater at a pressure of 210-6 Torr. Luminance and current density versus voltage 
characteristics of the devices were measured with a power supply (Keithley 2400), and EL 
spectra were recorded with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Ocean Optics usb2000). The 
optoelectronic measurements were conducted in a glove-box filled with nitrogen. 
4-3 Result and Discussion 
4-3-1 Characterization of Bipolar Monomer (M1) and Copolyfluorenes (P1-P3) 
Scheme 3-1 illustrates the synthetic routes used in the preparation of bipolar model 
compound Ma and main monomer M1. 1,2-Bis((4-bromophenyl)chloro 
methylene)hydrazine (4)93 and N-(4-nitrophenyl)-N-phenyl-benzenamine (8)127 were 
prepared according to the procedures reported previously. The copolyfluorenes (P1-P3) 
were synthesized by the Suzuki coupling reaction between 
9,9-dihexylfluorene-2,7-bis(trimethyleneborate) (19) and functionalized dibromo aromatic 
monomers (20 and M1) (Scheme 3-5), using Pd(PPh3)4 as reaction catalyst and Aliquat 336 
as phase-transfer catalyst. The feed ratios of monomer M1 in the preparation of P1, P2 and 
P3 were 3 mol%, 5 mol% and 10 mol%, respectively. Extra monomer 19 and 
monofunctional bromobenzene were added to end-cap polymer chain end after the 
polymerization.

Figure 4-1. (a) 1H NMR and (b) 13C NMR and (c) DEPT135 and (d) H-H COSY and (e) 
C-H HMQC spectra of M1 in CDCl3. 
Figure 4-1 shows the 1H NMR, 13C NMR, DEPT135, H-H COSY and C-H HMQC 
spectra of M1. Assignments of each carbon and proton are assisted by the two-dimensional 
NMR spectra [Figure 4-1(d)-(e)], which agree with the proposed molecular structure of 
M1. The main 1H NMR spectral difference between PF and P3 lies in chemical shift 
regions at 7.32~7.26 ppm and 7.19~7.11 ppm which originate from incorporated M1 
moieties [Figure 4-2(a)]. The existence of M1 moiety in P3 is confirmed by 13C NMR and 
DEPT135 spectra of M1, PF and P3 as shown in Figure 4-1(b)-(c) and Figure 4-2(b)-(c). 
In 13C NMR spectra of P3 chemical shifts of M1 moiety are obviously observed at 154.8 
ppm (8), 146.7 ppm (10) and 149.2 ppm (11). The molar percents of M1 moieties in P1, P2 
and P3 are 3.1, 4.8 and 11.2 mol% estimated from element analysis data. The 
copolyfluorenes are soluble in common organic solvents such as toluene, chloroform, 
chlorobenzene and 1,2-dichlorobenzene. Their weight-average molecular weights (Mw) and 
polydispersity indexes (PDI) are 1.60~2.42104 and 1.99~2.54 (Table 4-1), respectively, 
as determined by gel permeation chromatography using polystyrenes as calibration 
standards.

they are excited with 292 nm (absorption maximum of Ma) or 380 nm, suggesting efficient 
energy transfer from M1 moieties to fluorene segments under the photo-excitation. Partial 
spectral overlap between emission spectrum of M1 moieties and absorption spectrum of 
PF contributes greatly to the Förster energy transfer.65-69 It is noteworthy that emission 
spectrum of PF also partially overlaps with absorption spectrum of MEH-PPV [Figure 
4-4(a)], suggesting that energy transfer from PF to MEH-PPV can be expected. Based on 
this characteristic we fabricated efficient EL devices using blends of MEH-PPV and P1-P3 
as emitting layer and will be discussed later.

4-3-3 Electrochemical Investigations 
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to investigate the reduction-oxidation 
behaviors of model Ma, PF and P1-P3. Their HOMO and LUMO energy levels were 
estimated by the equations: EHOMO (eV) = ﹣(Eonset(ox),FOC + 4.8) and ELUMO (eV) = ﹣
(Eonset(red),FOC + 4.8), where Eonset(ox),FOC and Eonset(red),FOC are the onset oxidation and onset 
reduction potentials, respectively, relative to ferrocene/ferrocenium couple. The cyclic 
voltammograms are shown in Figure 4-6 and their electrochemical data are summarized in 
Table 4-3.

discrepancy is especially significant for P3 (0.17 eV). The electrochemical band gaps (Egel) 
are the difference between the LUMO and HOMO levels, which are estimated from onset 
oxidation and reduction potentials, respectively. Oxidation and reduction of a polymer may 
start from different parts if it contains electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups 
simultaneously. For example, the oxidation of P3 starts from triphenylamine units, while 
the reduction begins at triazole moieties. However, the optical band gaps (Egopt) are 
estimated from the longer onset wavelength of absorption spectra. As a result of different 
estimation bases, large discrepancy between electrochemical and optical band gaps is 
usually obtained in bipolar copolymers, such as P3. In this study, copolyfluorenes P1-P3 
 100
levels of Ma (-2.77 eV and -5.3 eV) are lower than those of MEH-PPV (-2.7 eV and -5.02 
eV) because of the electron-withdrawing aromatic 1,2,4-triazole moiety and 
electron-donating triphenylamine groups, respectively.119(b) Therefore, blending P1-P3 with 
the conventional MEH-PPV would increase its electron affinity and at the same time 
reduces its hole affinity. This might be an effective way in improving balance in charge 
injection/transport in conventional MEH-PPV whose hole injection and transport are 
believed to be much better than electron. 
4-3-4 Electroluminescent Enhancement of MEH-PPV by Bipolar Copolyfluorenes 
Electroluminescent devices with P1-P3 as emitting layers 
[ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P1-P3/Ca(50 nm)/Al(100 nm)] were fabricated to study their emitting 
characteristics. The turn-on voltages of P1-P3 devices increased from 5.2 to 9.3 V with 
increasing M1 moieties (3.1→11.2 %). The maximum luminance and maximum luminance 
efficiency of P1-P3 devices decrease from 1050 to 380 cd/m2 and from 0.29 to 0.14 cd/A 
respectively with increasing M1 moieties (from 3.1 to 11.2 mol%). The performance 
degradation at high content of M1 moieties is probably due to charge trapping in the 
bipolar moieties that reduce charge recombination in polyfluorene segments.131,132 
According to the energy band diagrams depicted in Figure 4-7, however, both LUMO 
and HOMO levels of model Ma are lower than those of MEH-PPV, suggesting that the 
bipolar units will promote electron injection and block hole transport in MEH-PPV device. 
Accordingly, we blended P1-P3 with MEH-PPV to improve the common defect of charge 
imbalance of the latter. Double-layer electroluminescent devices using blends of P1-P3 and 
MEH-PPV as emitting layers [ITO/PEDOT:PSS/(MEH-PPV+P1, P2 or P3)/Ca(50 nm)/Al 
(100 nm)] were fabricated and their device performances investigated. The weight ratios of 
MEH-PPV to the copolyfluorenes (MEH-PPV/P1, MEH-PPV/P2 and MEH-PPV/P3) are 
adjusted at 93/7, 96/4 and 98/2 wt%, respectively, to make the contents of bipolar M1 
moieties in the blends are roughly the same. The current density and luminance versus bias 
characteristics of the blend devices are shown in Figure 4-8, with the corresponding 
performance data summarized in Table 4-4. Turn-on voltages of the blending systems 
(2.9~3.2 V) are lower than that of MEH-PPV device (3.8 V) (Table 4-4). The maximum 
luminance and maximum luminance efficiency of the blend devices are improved to 
18,970 cd/m2 and 0.89 cd/A, respectively, from 3120 cd/m2 and 0.49 cd/A of the device 
using neat MEH-PPV as emitting layer. This is attributable to more balanced electron- and 
hole-injection/transport in the blend devices due to the presence of bipolar M1 moieties. 
The performance of blend device from P3 is superior to those from P1 and P2, probably 
due to the least polyfluorene contents (ca. 1.8 wt%) in emitting layer. This is the first report 
 102
enhancement in electron injection is inferior to hole-blocking effect that needs extra bias to 
turn on the devices.133

of EL devices using blends of MEH-PPV and P3 (2~20 wt%) as emitting layer. Device 
structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MEH-PPV + P3 (90~110 nm)/Ca(50 nm)/Al(100 nm). 
In order to elucidate the hole-blocking effect of P3 in blend devices, hole-only 
devices were fabricated [ITO/PEDOT:PSS/(MEH-PPV+ P3)/Au(20 nm)/Al (100 nm)] and 
their current density-bias characteristics investigated. As shown in Figure 4-10, the curve 
shifts horizontally to higher bias with increasing P3 contents. At a bias of 6 V, the current 
density decreases from 210 mA/cm2 to 85 mA/cm2 with an increase in P3 contents (from 0 
wt% to 5 wt%). Clearly, the current density decrease is mainly attributed to the 
hole-blocking effect of the bipolar units.

3120 cd/m2) as shown in Table 4-4. This clearly indicates that the performance 
enhancement in copolymer blend devices (MEH-PPV/P1~P3) is mainly attributed to the 
bipolar M1 moieties. The maximum luminance of the device is enhanced from 3,120 cd/m2 
to 19,560 cd/m2 and the maximum luminance efficiency is also improved from 0.49 cd/A 
to 1.08 cd/A as the weight ratio of P3 is increased from 0 to 5%. However, further increase 
in P3 contents leads to quick degradation in maximum luminance and maximum current 
efficiency, i.e. diminish to 2,830 cd/m2 and 0.38 cd/A at MEH-PPV/P3 = 80/20 
respectively. It is noteworthy that the EL efficiency of the blend devices depends upon the 
content of both bipolar units and fluorene segments. As mentioned above, the blend device 
obtained from MEH-PPV/P3 (98/2) shows higher luminance efficiency (0.89 cd/A) than 
those from MEH-PPV/P1 (93/7) and MEH-PPV/P2 (96/4) due to its lower content of 
fluorene segments, although their contents of the bipolar units are almost the same. In 
addition, the luminance efficiency of MEH-PPV/P3 devices is enhanced significantly 
(from 0.49 cd/A to 1.08 cd/A) when the weight ratio of P3 is increased from 0 to 5%. This 
indicates that the EL efficiency of the blend devices exhibits enhancing tendency with an 
increase in content of the bipolar units.  
Therefore, the inferior performance at high P3 composition is not caused by the 
greater concentration of the bipolar units. The result of morphology investigation can 
reasonably explain this performance reversion at higher P3 contents. As shown in Figure 
4-11, at low ratio of P3 (MEH-PPV/P3 = 95/5) the SEM micrograph shows a 
homogeneous surface morphology. However, the morphology becomes obviously 
microphase separated at high P3 ratio (MEH-PPV/P3 = 80/20). Therefore, the quick 
degradation of device performance can be attributed to the microphase separation formed 
during film preparation. However, our results show that low concentration of the bipolar 
units is already effective in enhancing optoelectronic performance of the conventional 
MEH-PPV.  
The 1931 CIE chromaticity coordinates of the EL emission shift slightly from (0.58, 
0.42) of pure MEH-PPV device to (0.50, 0.50) of blend device (MEH-PPV/P3 = 98/2) 
(Table 4-4). The emission is mainly originated from MEH-PPV (500~750 nm) for all 
devices and their full widths at half maximum (FWHM) are almost the same (ca. 90 nm) 
(Figure 4-12). However, the EL emissions of the blend devices reveal slight blue-shift 
(14-20 nm) and diminished emission at ca. 630 nm (excimer emission of MEH-PPV), 
which is probably due to reduced aggregation after blending with the copolyfluorenes.

4-4 Summary 
We successfully synthesized copolyfluorenes (P1-P3) containing bipolar 
N-phenyl-N-(4-(3,5-diphenyl-4H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)phenyl)benzenamine (Ma: 3.1 , 4.8 and 
11.2 mol%). The copolymers were soluble in common organic solvents and thermally 
stable (thermal decomposition temperature: 428~450 oC). The PL spectra of P1-P3 (λex = 
292 nm) were identical to that of PF (λex = 380 nm), due to efficient Förster energy transfer. 
The interchain interaction commonly occurred in PF was effectively suppressed after 
incorporating the bipolar moieties. The HOMO and LUMO levels of model Ma were -5.3 
eV and -2.77 eV, respectively. The HOMO levels of PF and P1-P3 were raised gradually 
from -5.63 eV to -5.49 eV with increasing bipolar units (from 0 to 11.2 mol%), while their 
LUMO levels lowered from -2.54 eV to -2.68 eV. Blending the copolyfluorenes with 
conventional MEH-PPV significantly enhanced its device performance due to improved 
carrier injection. The EL device using blend of MEH-PPV and P3 (MEH-PPV/P3 = 95/5) 
as emitting layer showed the best performance (maximum luminance: 19,560 cd/m2, 
maximum luminance efficiency: 1.08 cd/A), which were superior to those using 
MEH-PPV as emitting layer. Current results indicate that the copolyfluorenes containing 
bipolar moieties are very promising additive in promoting electroluminescent performance 
of MEH-PPV and other conjugated polymers.

5-1 Introduction 
For most PPV derivatives such as MEH-PPV, holes are more readily injected and 
transported than electrons, leading to unbalanced carriers injection when fabricated as 
PLEDs.11,107-110 Balanced and efficient injection and transport for both carriers are required 
to attain high device efficiency. Two methods have been attempted to improve the device 
efficiency. One is to apply an additional electron injection/transport layer between the 
emitter and cathode and/or a hole transporting layer between the emitter and anode.111-114 
Nevertheless, fabrication of multilayer polymer LEDs is usually a difficult task. From the 
cost-effective point of view, single-layer devices are preferred. Another approach is to 
fabricate single layer LEDs which blend charge injection/transport molecules such as 
oxadiazole, triazole, triphenylamine or carbazole derivatives. However, these kind of small 
molecules usually have low glass transition temperature (Tg) that causes crystallization and 
thermal breakdown during device operation.28-30 
Therefore, the development of charge injection/transport materials with high Tg is 
very important to enhance device performance. To overcome the above problems, several 
research groups reported the polymers contain electron- and/or hole-transporting groups 
with high Tg for improving device performance.13(b),31,70,115-119,134-138 To our knowledge, few 
researches have been focused on directly blending polymers containing bipolar groups to 
improve emission efficiency of another light-emitting polymer.138 
In our previous study (Chapter 4), three copolyfluorenes (P1-P3) containing bipolar 
groups (3.1~11.2 mol%) in the main chain, directly linked hole-transporting 
triphenylamine and electron-transporting 1,2,4-triazole, are synthesized by Suzuki 
coupling reaction. Blending the bipolar copolyfluorenes with MEH-PPV effectively 
improve the emission efficiency of their electroluminescent devices.138 
In this work, we synthesized a new bipolar monomer (M2) to prepare copolyfluorenes 
(P4-P6) containing 2.1-8.2 mol% pendant bipolar groups. The bipolar unit consists of 
electron-transporting aromatic 1,2,4-triazole directly linked with hole-transporting 
triphenylamine. The copolyfluorenes not only enhance the injection of holes and electrons 
but also lessen excimer formation under thermal annealing due to non-planar structure of 
the bipolar units. Finally, the influence of bipolar contents on device performance is 
investigated, using blends of the copolyfluorenes and MEH-PPV as emitting layer. Both 
maximum luminance and maximum luminance efficiency of the blend devices are greatly 
enhanced up to 11090 cd/m2 and 0.56 cd/A, respectively. Consequently, copolyfluorenes 
with bipolar moieties attached as pendant groups are applicable to enhance emission 
efficiency of PPV-based polymers.

5-3 Result and Discussion 
5-3-1 Characterization of Bipolar Monomer (M2) and Copolyfluorenes (P4-P6) 
Scheme 3-2 illustrates the synthetic routes employed in the preparation of bipolar 
monomer M2. N-(4-nitrophenyl)-N-phenylbenzenamine (8)127 and N’, 
N’-diphenylbenzene-1,4-diamine (9)138 were prepared according to the procedures reported 
previously. The copolyfluorenes (P4-P6) were synthesized by the Suzuki coupling reaction 
of 9,9-dihexylfluorene-2,7-bis(trimethyleneborate) (19) with functionalized dibromo 
aromatic monomers (20 and M2) (Scheme 3-6, Chapter 3), using Pd(PPh3)4 as the reaction 
catalyst and Aliquat 336 as the phase-transfer catalyst. The feed ratios of monomer M2 in 
the preparation of P4, P5 and P6 were 3 mol%, 5 mol% and 10 mol% respectively. Extra 
monomer 19 and monofunctional bromobenzene were added to end-cap polymer chain 
after the polymerization. Figure 5-1 shows the 1H NMR, 13C NMR, DEPT135, H-H COSY 
and C-H HMQC spectra of M2. Assignments of each carbon and proton were assisted by 
the two-dimensional NMR spectra [Figure 5-1 (d)-(e)], which agree well with the proposed 
molecular structure of M2.

The actual molar percents of M2 moieties in P4, P5 and P6 are 2.1, 3.3 and 8.2 mol%, 
respectively, as estimated from the elemental analysis data. This indicates that the bipolar 
monomer M2 is less reactive than 9,9-dihexyl-2,7-dibromofluorene (20), which is 
probably due to steric hindrance and electron-deficient characteristic of its bipolar moiety.

5-3-2 Photophysical Properties of Bipolar Copolyfluorenes (P4-P6) 
    Figure 5-3 illustrates the absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of PF and 
P4-P6 in CHCl3 and as films spin-coated from CHCl3 solutions, with the characteristic 
optical data summarized in Table 5-2. The absorption maximum and main emission peak of 
the bipolar model Ma (Scheme 3-1, Chapter 3) in CHCl3 appear at ca. 292 nm (with a 
shoulder at 271 nm) and 386 nm, respectively.138 However, the absorption maxima of 
P4-P6 in CHCl3 locate at 388, 384 and 383 nm, with only small shorter-wavelength 
absorptions at ca. 292 nm. The major absorption of P4-P6 (383~388 nm) can be attributed 
to the π-π* transitions of their conjugated backbone, whereas the shorter-wavelength 
absorption (ca. 292 nm) is definitely originated from M2 moieties.

 116
Solid state absorption maxima of PF and P4-P6 are slightly red-shifted (1~5 nm) 
relative to solution state ones due to aggregate formation via intra- or inter-chain 
interaction. P4-P6 exhibit PL peaks at 418~419 nm which are very close to 419 nm of PF. 
Moreover, the PL spectra of P4-P6 were almost the same whether they were excited with 
292 nm (absorption maximum of Ma) or 383 nm, suggesting efficient Förster energy 
transfer from M2 moieties to fluorene segments under the photo-excitation. Partial overlap 
between emission spectrum of M2 moieties and absorption spectrum of PF contributes 
greatly to the energy transfer.65-69,138 It is noteworthy that the emission spectrum of PF 
partially overlaps with the absorption spectrum of MEH-PPV, suggesting that energy 
transfer from PF to MEH-PPV can be expected.138 Based on this characteristic we 
fabricated efficient PLEDs using blends of MEH-PPV and P4-P6 as emitting layer and will 
be discussed later.

Figure 5-5. PL spectra of PF and P4-P6 after annealing in vacuum at 150 oC for 24 h. 
Relative PL quantum yields (PL) of PF, P4, P5 and P6 in chloroform (at a 
concentration of 10-5 M) are 0.83, 0.79, 0.71 and 0.68, respectively. The PLs of the 
copolyfluorenes are slightly lower than that of PF, probably caused by torsion-induced 
non-radiative deactivation occurred at non-planar triphenylamine groups.128,138 
Polyfluorenes usually show undesirable green emission after thermal annealing or under 
device operation, which has been attributed to enhanced intermolecular interaction.129,130 
To examine color stability, PF and P4-P6 films were thermal annealed at 150 oC for 24 h 
to observe their PL spectra variations. As shown in Figure 5-5, the green emission appears 
at ca. 500~600 nm in PF film after the thermal treatment; however, it is significantly

Model Ma would emit green light corresponding to its band-gap (2.53 eV), but its 
main emission peak (386 nm) deviates from green emission significantly. In order to 
elucidate this abnormal phenomena, both LUMO and HOMO levels of 
3,4,5-triphenyl-4H-1,2,4-triazole (TAZ) and triphenylamine (TPA) were estimated from 
their cyclic voltammograms. The estimated LUMO levels of Ma, TAZ and TPA are -2.77, 
-2.71 and -2.12 eV, and the estimated HOMO levels are -5.3, -6.12 and -5.27 eV, 
respectively.The LUMO and HOMO levels of Ma are close to LUMO level of TAZ and 
HOMO level of TPA, respectively. This indicates that the LUMO level of Ma originates 
from LUMO level of TAZ, whereas the HOMO level from TPA. Under cyclic 
voltammetric analysis of bipolar Ma, the oxidation and reduction start from triphenylamine 
and aromatic triazole groups, respectively. Consequently, the electrochemically-determined 
band-gap (Egel) of Ma is roughly the energy difference between LUMO level of TAZ and 
HOMO level of TPA. 
In this study, copolyfluorenes P4-P6 contain 2.1~8.2 mol% of bipolar M2 moieties 
derived from electron-transporting triazole and hole-transporting triphenylamine. The 
estimated HOMO levels of PF, P4-P6 are -5.63, -5.61, -5.58 and -5.52 eV, whereas the 
estimated LUMO energy levels are -2.59, -2.60, -2.62 and -2.66 eV, respectively. The 
HOMO levels of P4-P6 are raised gradually from -5.63 eV to -5.52 eV with an increase in 
M2 moieties (2.1 mol%→8.2 mol%) (Figure 5-7), suggesting that their hole affinity is in 
the order of P6 > P5 > P4. On the contrary, the LUMO levels of P4-P6 are lowered 
slightly (-2.59 eV→-2.66 eV) with increasing M2 moieties, meaning that their electron 
 120
According to the energy band diagrams depicted in Figure 5-7, both LUMO and 
HOMO levels of model Ma are lower than those of MEH-PPV, suggesting that the M2 
moieties will promote electron transport and block hole transport in MEH-PPV device. To 
elucidate this speculation, blends of MEH-PPV with Ma, TAZ or TPA were spin-coated as 
emitting layers to fabricate double-layer light-emitting devices 
[ITO/PEDOT:PSS/(MEH-PPV+ Ma, TAZ or TPA)/Ca(50 nm)/Al (100 nm)] and their 
device performance investigated.

The operational stability of blend-based (MEH-PPV/P6 = 95/5) and MEH-PPV-based 
devices are shown in Figure 5-13. The half-decay lifetimes (t1/2) of MEH-PPV/P6 (95/5) 
and neat MEH-PPV device were about 93 min (L0 = 668 cd/m2) and 95 min (L0 = 855 
cd/m2), respectively. For driving at L0 = 100 cd/m2, the estimated half-decay lifetimes 
(t1/2)140,141 of the blend- and MEH-PPV-based devices were about 620 min and 810 min 
respectively, indicating that the blend device is slightly inferior to MEH-PPV device in 
terms of operational stability. The results of surface morphology investigation (Figure 5-14) 
after thermal annealing (90oC, 24 h) are also consistent with the devices’ half-decay 
lifetimes; i.e., the blend film demonstrated higher surface roughness before and after the 
thermal annealing (1.01 nm1.46 nm) than MEH-PPV (0.93 nm1.21 nm).

devices is exclusively originated from MEH-PPV, with full width at half-maxima (fwhm) 
being ca. 80 nm. The 1931 CIE coordinates (x, y) of the EL emission only shift slightly 
from (0.54, 0.46) of MEH-PPV-based device to (0.52, 0.48) of blend devices 
(MEH-PPV/P6 = 97.5/2.5, MEH-PPV/P6 = 95/5). Furthermore, the excimer emission of 
MEH-PPV at ca. 625 nm is also diminished due probably to reduced aggregation after 
blending with the copolyfluorenes. Therefore, slight amount of copolyfluorenes P4-P6 
containing bipolar groups (M2 moieties) is effective in enhancing device performance of 
the conventional MEH-PPV. 
5-4 Summary 
    We have successfully synthesized copolyfluorenes (P4-P6) containing pendant 
bipolar groups (M2 moieties: 2.1, 3.3 and 8.2 mol%). The copolyfluorenes were soluble in 
common organic solvents and thermally stable (thermal decomposition temperature at 5 
wt% loss: 422~439 oC). The PL spectra of P4-P6 were identical to that of PF, due to 
efficient Förster energy transfer. Estimated LUMO and HOMO levels of model Ma were 
-5.3 eV and -2.77 eV, which are mainly attributed to LUMO levels of TAZ and HOMO 
levels of TPA, respectively. The HOMO levels of PF and P4-P6 were raised gradually 
from -5.63 eV to -5.52 eV with increasing bipolar moieties (from 0 to 8.2 mol%), while 
their LUMO levels lowered slightly from -2.59 eV to -2.66 eV. Blending bipolar Ma with 
MEH-PPV enhanced the device efficiency (maximum luminance: 6830 cd/m2, maximum 
luminance efficiency: 0.50 cd/A). Furthermore, blending the copolyfluorenes with 
MEH-PPV resulted in further significant performance enhancement due to improved 
carriers injection and transport. P6-based blend device (MEH-PPV/P6 = 95/5) showed the 
best performance (maximum luminance: 11090 cd/m2, maximum luminance efficiency: 
0.56 cd/A). Current results indicate that the copolyfluorenes containing bipolar moieties 
are promising additives in greatly improving device performance of MEH-PPV and other 
conjugated polymers.

6-1 Introduction 
An efficient PLED requires a balanced injection and transport between electrons and 
holes.111 Unfortunately, electron injection is usually more difficult than hole injection in 
conjugated polymers, such as PPV derivatives, leading to the imbalance between electron 
and hole injection and transport, which greatly reduces the luminescence efficiency of their 
PLEDs.11,107-110 Two strategies have been attempted to balance the injection and transport 
between electrons and holes. One is to insert an additional electron injection/transport layer 
between the emitter and the cathode.111-114 Nonetheless, fabrication of the multilayer device 
from polymers, typically deposited by spin-coating, is usually a difficult task since the 
solution of a subsequent electron injection/transport layer will damage the previously 
coated light-emitting layer.  
Another strategy is to fabricate single-layer LEDs which blend charge injection/ 
transport molecules such as oxadiazole, 1,2,4-triazole, triphenylamine or carbazole 
derivatives. Nevertheless, the small molecules might cause crystallization-induced 
degradation and thermal breakdown during device operation if their glass transition 
temperatures (Tg) are low.28-30 Consequently, the development of charges 
injection/transport materials with high thermal stability is an important issue in PLEDs 
material design. Several research groups prepared high-Tg polymers carrying electron- 
and/or hole-transporting groups in an attempt to improve device 
performance.13(b),31,70,115-119,134-138 
In addition, poly(p-phenylene)s (PPPs)12(a),142-146 are typical conjugated polymers 
showing excellent thermal stability. Moreover, their emission spectra overlap largely with 
the absorption spectrum of PPV derivatives (d6-PPV) (Scheme 3-3, Chpater 3). The 
spectral overlap will facilitate photo-excited energy transfer from PPPs to d6-PPV. 
Triphenylamine and its derivatives have attracted considerable interest as hole transport 
materials for use in organic electroluminescence (EL) devices due to their relatively high 
hole mobility and low ionization potentials.117,125 On the contrary, aromatic 1,2,4-triazole 
and related derivatives are electron-deficient materials that possess good thermal and 
chemical stabilities, leading to their common use as electron-transport and hole-blocking 
materials in LEDs.28,93,123,124 In general, hole- and electron-transporting materials also 
demonstrate simultaneously enhanced hole and electron injection, respectively. 
In our previous study (Chapter 4), three copolyfluorenes (P1-P3) containing bipolar 
groups (3.1~11.2 mol%) in the main chain, directly linked hole-transporting 
triphenylamine and electron-transporting 1,2,4-triazole, are synthesized by Suzuki 
 132
PEDOT:PSS layer from a polymer solution in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (10 mg/ml). Finally, 
calcium and aluminum were consecutively vacuum-deposited as cathode using a vacuum 
coater at a pressure of 210-6 Torr. Luminance and current density versus voltage 
characteristics of the devices were measured with a power supply (Keithley 2400), and EL 
spectra were recorded with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Ocean Optics usb2000). The 
optoelectronic measurements were conducted in a glove-box filled with nitrogen.

6-3-1 Characterization of Bipolar Monomer (M1), Copoly(p-phenylene)s (P7 and P8) 
and Poly(p-phenylene) (P0) 
In this study, dibromo bipolar monomer (M1), directly linked triphenylamine and 
1,2,4-triazole, was used to synthesize copoly(p-phenylene)s with bipolar groups (P7 and 
P8). N-(4-(3,5-bis(4-bromophenyl)-4H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)phenyl)-N-phenyl benzenamine 
(M1) containing bipolar moieties was synthesized according to the synthetic routes 
outlined in Schemes 3-1.138 The main 1H NMR spectral difference between P0 and 
copoly(p-phenylene) (P7) lies in chemical shift regions at 7.33~7.28 ppm and 7.18~7.12 
ppm which originate from incorporated M1 moieties (Figure 6-1).

6-3-2 Photophysical Properties of Copoly(p-phenylene)s (P7 and P8), 
Poly(p-phenylene) (P0) and d6-PPV 
    Optical properties of the polymers were investigated by absorption and 
photoluminescence (PL) spectra, both in solution and film states, to evaluate the influence 
of the bipolar groups. Figure 6-3 illustrates the absorption and PL spectra of P0, P7, P8 
and d6-PPV in CHCl3 and as films spin-coated from CHCl3 solutions, with the 
characteristic optical data summarized in Table 6-2. The absorption maximum and main 
emission peak of the bipolar model Ma (Scheme 3-1, Chapter 3) in CHCl3 appear at ca. 
292 nm with a shoulder at 271 nm and 386 nm, respectively. The absorption maxima of P0, 
P7, P8 and d6-PPV in CHCl3 locate at 351, 335, 349 and 423 nm, accompanied with 
shorter-wavelength absorptions at 290, 292, 292 and 354 nm, respectively. The major and 
maximum absorption of P0, P7, P8 and d6-PPV (335~423 nm) can be attributed to the 
π-π* transitions of main chain, whereas the shorter-wavelength absorption (ca. 292 nm) is 
definitely originated from M1 moieties. The major absorption of P7 (335 nm) shows a 
moderate blue-shift of 16 nm relative to P0 (351 nm) due to the interruption of 
poly(p-phenylene) main chain by the bipolar moieties. This can be supported by the 
existence of a large twist angle (ca. 90º) between adjacent benzene rings extending from 
bipolar M1 unit (Figure 6-4), simulated by minimizing energy via semi-empirical MNDO 
calculations in the gas states.139 Accordingly, the effective conjugation length of 
poly(p-phenylene) is readily decreased by the incorporation of bipolar M1 units. Solid

Moreover, the PL spectra of P7 and P8 were almost identical whether they were 
excited with 292 nm (absorption maximum of Ma) or 335 nm for P7 and 349 nm for P8, 
suggesting efficient Förster energy transfer from M1 moieties to phenylene segments under 
the photo-excitations. Partial overlap between emission spectrum of M1 moieties and 
absorption spectrum of P0 contributes greatly to the energy transfer.65-69,138 It is noteworthy 
that the emission spectrum of P0 partially overlaps with the absorption spectrum of 
d6-PPV, indicating that energy transfer from P0 to d6-PPV can be expected. Based on this

between the LUMO and HOMO levels, which in turn are estimated from the onset 
oxidation and reduction potentials, respectively. However, oxidation and reduction may 
start from different parts of a polymer. Therefore, the discrepancy between the band-gaps 
determined electrochemically (Egel) and optically (Egopt) is probably due to their different 
estimating bases.

In this study, copoly(p-phenylene)s (P7 and P8) contain 12.8 mol% and 6.8 mol% of 
bipolar M1 moieties, respectively, derived from electron-transporting triazole and 
hole-transporting triphenylamine. The estimated HOMO levels of P0, P7, P8, d6-PPV and 
Ma are -5.50, -5.39, -5.45, -5.26 and -5.30 eV, whereas the estimated LUMO energy levels 
are -2.43, -2.48, -2.45, -2.65 and -2.77 eV, respectively. The HOMO levels (-5.39 and -5.45 
eV) of P7 and P8 are raised relative to P0 (-5.50 eV) after incorporating M1 moieties (12.8 
and 6.8 mol%), respectively, suggesting that their hole affinity is in the order of P7 > P8 > 
P0. On the contrary, the LUMO levels of P7 (-2.48 eV) and P8 (-2.45 eV) are slightly 
lower than that of P0 (-2.43 eV) after introducing M1 moieties, respectively, meaning that 
energy barrier of electron injection from cathode is in the order of P7 > P8 > P0. Therefore, 
both hole and electron affinity of P7 and P8 are enhanced due to the incorporation of 
bipolar M1 moieties, resulting in improved carriers injection and transport. Moreover, both 
HOMO and LUMO levels of model Ma (-2.77 eV and -5.30 eV) are lower than those of 
d6-PPV (-2.65 eV and -5.26 eV) because of the electron-withdrawing aromatic 
1,2,4-triazole moiety.93,147 Accordingly, blending d6-PPV with P7 or P8 would increase its 
electron affinity but reduces its hole affinity simultaneously. This might be an effective 
 140
with the representative performance data summarized in Table 6-4.

Figure 6-7. (a) Current density versus bias and (b) luminance versus bias characteristics of 
PLEDs using blends of d6-PPV and P7 (2~8 wt%), P8 (7.5 wt%) or P0 (4 wt%) as 
emitting layer. Device configuration: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/d6-PPV + P7, P8 or P0 (80~100 
nm)/Ca(50 nm)/Al(100 nm). 
The turn-on voltages are effectively reduced from 3.9 V of neat d6-PPV device to 3.3 
and 3.5 V respectively when the emitting layers are blends of 2 and 4 wt% of P7 with 
d6-PPV. Moreover, maximum luminance and maximum luminance efficiency of the blend 
device containing 4 wt % P7 are enhanced to 1450 cd/m2 and 0.20 cd/A respectively, 
which are superior to 310 cd/m2 and 0.03 cd/A of the neat d6-PPV device (Figure 6-8). 
 142
In addition, the performance at 4 wt % P7 is better than at 2 wt % P7, which is 
attributable to more balanced charges injection and transport. However, the turn-on 
voltages increase slightly from 3.3 V to 3.5 V with increasing P7 contents (2 wt%→4 
wt%). The electron injection enhancement seems inferior to hole-blocking effect so that 
extra bias is needed to turn on the devices.133 However, further increase in P7 contents 
leads to degradation in maximum luminance and maximum current efficiency; i.e., 
diminish to 450 cd/m2 and 0.08 cd/A at d6-PPV/P7 = 92/8. This performance degradation 
is probably due to imbalanced charges injection and transport at high P7 contents. 
Nevertheless, it is evident that only a small amount of the bipolar P7 is effective in 
improving the performance of conventional d6-PPV. 
In order to confirm the relation between device performance and bipolar groups we 
compared the performance of blend devices containing different bipolar 
copoly(p-phenylene)s (P7 and P8), by keeping the bipolar groups at about 0.5 wt%. The 
optoelectronic performance of the P7-based blend device (d6-PPV/P7 = 96/4) is superior 
to that of P8-based one (d6-PPV/P8 = 92.5/7.5) as shown in Figure 6-7 and Table 6-4. 
This result suggests that the poly(p-phenylene) segments also play a role in determining 
the device performance in addition to the bipolar groups. Higher content of 
poly(p-phenylene) segments in P8 (ca. 7.0 wt%) leads to degraded device performance. 
Moreover, double-layer electroluminescent device using blend of P0 and d6-PPV 
(d6-PPV/P0 = 96/4) as emitting layer was also fabricated to investigate the influence of 
poly(p-phenylene) (P0) on device performance. 
Its performance is inferior to that of device using neat d6-PPV as emitting layer 
(Figure 6-7 and Table 6-4), indicating that the poly(p-phenylene) deteriorates the 
performance of d6-PPV. The HOMO and LUMO levels of d6-PPV (-5.26 eV, -2.65 eV) 
are encompassed within those of P0 (-5.50 eV, -2.43 eV). Therefore, blending with P0 will 
reduce charges injection and transport in d6-PPV. The reduction in charges injection and 
transport increases with an increase in poly(p-phenylene) contents. Accordingly, the 
performance of P8-based device with higher content of poly(p-phenylene) segments is 
inferior to that of P7-based one. 
Our previous study showed that the luminance efficiency of MEH-PPV device (0.49 
cd/A) was enhanced 2.2 times to 1.08 cd/A after blending with bipolar copolyfluorene (ca. 
0.5 wt % of bipolar groups in the blend).138 In this study, the enhancement in the luminance 
efficiency of d6-PPV device (0.03 cd/A) was 6.7 times after blending with bipolar 
copoly(p-phenylene) (P7) (d6-PPV/P7 = 96/4, luminance efficiency: 0.20 cd/A). 
Therefore, the bipolar copoly(p-phenylene) (P7) is more effective than bipolar 
 144
effective in enhancing device performance of d6-PPV.

6-4 Summary 
We have successfully synthesized two novel bipolar copoly(p-phenylene)s (P7 and P8) 
containing bipolar groups (M1 moieties: 12.8 mol% and 6.8 mol%, respectively). The 
poly(p-phenylene)s (P0, P7 and P8) were soluble in common organic solvents and 
thermally stable (thermal decomposition temperature at 5 wt% loss: 429, 450 and 444 oC). 
The PL spectra of P7 and P8 were identical to that of P0, due to efficient Förster energy 
transfer. The HOMO levels of P0, P7 and P8 were -5.50 eV, -5.39 eV and -5.45 eV, 
respectively, while their LUMO levels were -2.43 eV, -2.48 eV and -2.45eV. Blending the 
copoly(p-phenylene)s with d6-PPV resulted in significant performance enhancement due 
to improved carriers injection and transport. Blend device (d6-PPV/P7 = 96/4) showed the 
best performance [the luminescence efficiency (0.20 cd/A) was found to be enhanced by a 
factor of 6.7 with a maximum brightness of 1450 cd/m2]. The function of the bipolar 
structure is to balance charges recombination in d6-PPV-based devices. Current results 
indicate that the copoly(p-phenylene)s containing bipolar moieties are promising additives 
to improve device performance of d6-PPV and other conjugated polymers.

7-1 Introduction 
As previously mentioned, maintaining a balance between electron and hole currents in 
PLEDs is an important factor for achieving high device efficiency.111 However, for 
conventional electroluminescent MEH-PPV 
{poly[2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene]}, holes are more readily 
injected and transported than electrons, leading to unbalanced carriers currents in PLEDs. 
11,107-110 Therefore, various methods have been attempted to improve the device efficiency. 
One is to insert an additional electron injection/transport layer between the emitter and the 
cathode.111-114 Nevertheless, fabrication of the multilayer polymer LEDs is usually a 
difficult task, since the emitting layer might be re-dissolved during subsequent spin-coating 
of the electron injection/transport layer. Single-layer devices are preferred from the 
viewpoints of process simplicity and cost effectiveness. 
Another method is to fabricate single-layer LEDs which blend charge 
injection/transport molecules such as oxadiazole, 1,2,4-triazole (TAZ), triphenylamine or 
carbazole (CAZ)  derivatives. However, crystallization-induced degradation and thermal 
breakdown during device operation might readily happen on account of their poor thermal 
stability.28-30 Therefore, many research groups prepared thermally stable polymers carrying 
electron- and/or hole-transporting groups in an attempt to improve device performance. 
13(b),31,70,115-119,134-138 
To our knowledge, few researches have been focused on directly blending functional 
polymers containing bipolar groups to enhance emission efficiency of another 
light-emitting polymer. In our previous study (Chapter 5), the device performances were 
significantly enhanced (11090 cd/m2 and 0.56 cd/A), using blends of the pendant bipolar 
copolyfluorenes (with triphenylamine and 1,2,4-triazole moieties) (P4-P6) and MEH-PPV 
as emitting layer.138(b) 
In this work, we demonstrate the synthesis of a new bipolar monomer (M3) and the 
following preparation of three copolyfluorenes (P9-P11) containing 2.5~7.7 mol% pendant 
bipolar groups by the Suzuki coupling reaction. The bipolar unit consists of 
electron-transporting aromatic 1,2,4-triazole directly linked with hole-transporting 
carbazole. The copolyfluorenes not only enhance the injection of holes and electrons but 
also lessen excimer formation under thermal annealing due to non-planar structure of the 
bipolar groups. Finally, the influence of bipolar contents on device performance is 
investigated, using blends of the copolyfluorenes and MEH-PPV as emitting layer. Both 
maximum luminance and maximum luminance efficiency of the blends-based PLEDs are 
further enhanced to 15690 cd/m2 and 0.81 cd/A, respectively, relative to those of our 
 148
7-3 Result and Discussion 
7-3-1 Characterization of Bipolar Monomer (M3) and Copolyfluorenes (P9-P11) 
Scheme 3-4 illustrates the synthetic routes employed in the preparation of novel 
bipolar monomer M3. 9-(4-nitrophenyl)-9H-carbazole (17)148 and 
4-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)benzenamine (18)148 were prepared according to the procedures 
reported previously. The copolyfluorenes (P9-P11) were synthesized by the Suzuki 
coupling reaction of 9,9-dihexylfluorene-2,7-bis (trimethyleneborate) (19) with 
functionalized dibromo aromatic monomers (20 and M3) (Scheme 3-8, Chapter 3), using 
Pd(PPh3)4 as the reaction catalyst and Aliquat 336 as the phase-transfer catalyst. The feed 
ratios of monomer M3 in the preparation of P9, P10 and P11 were 3 mol%, 5 mol% and 10 
mol% respectively. Extra monomer 19 and mono-functional bromobenzene were added to 
end-cap polymer chain after the polymerization.  
Figure 7-1 shows the 1H NMR, 13C NMR, DEPT135, H-H COSY and C-H HMQC 
spectra of M3. Assignments of each carbon and proton were assisted by the 
two-dimensional NMR spectra [Figure 7-1 (d)-(e)], which agree well with the proposed 
molecular structure of M3. The existence of M3 moiety in P11 is confirmed by 13C NMR 
and DEPT135 spectra of M3, PF and P11 as shown in Figure 7-1 (b)-(c) and Figure 7-2. In 
13C NMR spectra of P11 chemical shifts of M3 moiety are obviously observed at 132.2 
ppm (12), 128.8 ppm (2), 128.6 ppm (4), 128.4 ppm (3) and 127.2 ppm (14).

1.95~2.33 (Table 7-1) respectively, as determined by gel permeation chromatography using 
mono-disperse polystyrenes as calibration standards. 
Thermal decomposition temperatures (Td) (at 5 wt% loss) and glass transition 
temperatures (Tg) of the copolyfluorenes were evaluated with thermal gravimetric analysis 
(TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), respectively. The residual weights of 
P9-P11 and PF (at 800oC) are above 50% under nitrogen atmosphere (Figure 7-3). As 
shown in Table 7-1, the thermal decomposition temperatures (Td: 469~482 oC) of the 
copolyfluorenes (P9-P11) are higher than that of PF (Td: 440oC). Moreover, the 
copolyfluorenes reveal higher glass-transition temperatures (101~120oC) than PF (91oC) 
and the Tg increases gradually increasing M3 moieties in main chain. This is attributable to 
rigid and non-planar structure of M3 moieties which not only raises chain rigidity but also 
restrict chain mobility of the copolyfluorenes.65,66,138 Accordingly, the copolyfluorenes 
exhibit better thermal stability than PF; i.e., their thermal decomposition (469~482oC) and 
glass-transition temperatures (101~120oC) are higher than those of PF (440oC, 91oC).

cΦPL: Determined in CHCl3, relative to quinine sulfate in 1N H2SO4(aq) at a concentration of 10-5 M 
(ΦPL = 0.55). 
The major absorption shifts slightly from 389 nm (PF) to 380 nm (P11) because the 
conjugation of polyfluorene main chain is interrupted by the bipolar moieties. This can be 
substantiated by the existence of twist angles (ca. 90º) between heterocyclic ring and 
adjacent benzene rings of bipolar M3 units (Figure 7-6), simulated by minimizing energy 
via semi-empirical MNDO calculations in the gas states.139 
Solid state absorption maxima of PF and P9-P11 are slightly red-shifted (5~7 nm) 
relative to solution state ones due to aggregate formation via intra- or inter-chain 
interactions. Copolyfluorenes P9-P11 exhibit PL peaks at 418~419 nm which are very 
close to 419 nm of PF. Moreover, the PL spectra of P9-P11 were almost the same whether 
they were excited with 292 nm (absorption maximum of Mb) or 380 nm, confirming 
efficient Förster energy transfer from bipolar M3 moieties to fluorene segments under the 
photo-excitation. Partial overlap between emission spectrum of M3 moieties and 
absorption spectrum of PF contributes greatly to the energy transfer.65-69,138 It is 
noteworthy that the emission spectrum of PF partially overlaps with the absorption 
spectrum of MEH-PPV, indicating that energy transfer from PF to MEH-PPV can be 
expected.138 Based on this characteristic we fabricated efficient PLEDs using blends of 
MEH-PPV and P9-P11 as emitting layer and will be discussed later. 
Relative PL quantum yields (PL) of PF, P9, P10 and P11 in chloroform (at a 
concentration of 10-5 M) are 0.82, 0.79, 0.77 and 0.72, respectively. The PLs of the

empirical MNDO calculation. 
Polyfluorenes usually show undesirable green emission after thermal annealing or 
under device operation, which has been attributed to enhanced intermolecular 
interactions.129,130  To examine stability in emission color, PF and P9-P11 films were 
thermally annealed at 150oC for 24 h to observe their PL spectral variations. As shown in 
Figure 7-7, the green emission appears at ca. 500~600 nm in PF film after the thermal 
treatment; however, it is significantly suppressed in P9-P11 films. This result suggests that 
the non-planar bipolar M3 moieties are effective in suppressing the intermolecular 
interactions in the copolyfluorenes.

Bipolar model Mb would emit blue-green light corresponding to its band-gap (2.80 
eV), but its main emission peak (347 nm) with a shoulder at 359 nm obviously strays from 
blue-green emission. To elucidate above interesting phenomena, we also estimated the 
LUMO and HOMO energy levels of bipolar model Mb, triazole model TAZ and carbazole 
model CAZ from their cyclic voltammograms. The LUMO levels of Mb, TAZ and CAZ 
are -2.79, -2.71 and -2.45 eV, and the estimated HOMO levels are -5.59, -6.12 and -5.53 eV, 
respectively (Table 7-3). Obviously, the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of Mb are close 
to LUMO level of TAZ and HOMO level of CAZ, respectively. This indicates that the 
LUMO and HOMO levels of Mb are attributed to triazole and carbazole moieties, 
respectively. Accordingly, when Mb is subjected to external potentials, the reduction starts 
from electron-deficient aromatic 1,2,4-triazole and the oxidation begins from electron-rich 
9-phenyl-9H-carbazole groups, respectively.

In this study, copolyfluorenes P9-P11 contain 2.5~7.7 mol% of bipolar M3 moieties 
derived from electron-transporting triazole and hole-transporting carbazole. The estimated 
HOMO energy levels of PF, P9-P11 are -5.65, -5.64, -5.63 and -5.61 eV, whereas the 
estimated LUMO levels are -2.49, -2.50, -2.52 and -2.55 eV, respectively. The HOMO 
levels of P9-P11 are raised gradually from -5.65 eV to -5.61 eV with an increase in M3 
moieties (2.5 mol%→7.7 mol%) (Figure 7-9), suggesting that their hole affinity is in the 
order of P11 > P10 > P9. On the contrary, the LUMO levels of P9-P11 are lowered slightly 
(-2.49 eV→-2.55 eV) with increasing M3 moieties, meaning that their electron injection 
ability is improved in the order of P11 > P10 > P9.

recombination in polyfluorene segments.131,132 
As mentioned above, both LUMO and HOMO levels of bipolar model Mb are lower 
than those of MEH-PPV (Figure 7-9). This suggests that the M3 moieties will promote 
electron injection/transport and block hole transport in MEH-PPV device. To elucidate this 
reasoning, MEH-PPV was blended with bipolar P9-P11 and used as emitting layers to 
solve its common defect of unbalanced charges injection and transport. Double-layer 
polymer light-emitting diodes [ITO/PEDOT:PSS/(MEH-PPV+P9, P10 or P11)/Ca(50 
nm)/Al (100 nm)] were fabricated to investigate their device performances. 
The weight ratios of MEH-PPV to the bipolar copolyfluorenes (MEH-PPV/P9, 
MEH-PPV/P10 and MEH-PPV/P11) were controlled at 91/9, 94/6 and 97/3, respectively, 
to adjust the ratios of bipolar moieties to be ca. 0.2 wt%. Figure 7-10 shows the current 
density and luminance versus bias characteristics of the blend devices, with the 
representative data summarized in Table 7-4. The blend devices exhibit slightly higher 
turn-on voltages (3.3~4.1 V) than MEH-PPV device (3.3 V), indicating that electron 
injection enhancement by the bipolar moieties seems inferior to their hole-blocking effect 
that higher bias is needed to turn on the devices.133,138 However, the maximum luminance 
and maximum luminance efficiency of the blend devices are significantly enhanced to 
8780~13350 cd/m2 and 0.56~0.79 cd/A, respectively, when compared with 3230 cd/m2 and 
0.29 cd/A of the MEH-PPV device. Apparently the bipolar M3 moieties in emitting layer 
effectively balance charges injection and transport under device operation.  
In addition, the device performance seems mainly dependent on the contents of 
fluorene segments (from copolyfluorenes). For instance, P11-based blend device reveals 
the best EL performance, due probably to the least content of fluorene segments (ca. 2.8 
wt%) relative to P9- and P10-based devices (ca. 8.8 wt% and 5.8 wt%). This means that 
higher percents of fluorene segments in emitting layer (as in P9- and P10-based devices) 
leads to inferior device performance. As shown in Figure 6, the HOMO (-5.02 eV) and 
LUMO energy levels (-2.70 eV) of MEH-PPV lies between those of 
poly(9,9-dihexylfluorene) (PF: -5.65 eV, -2.49 eV). Therefore, charges injection and 
transport ability of the blend is reduced with increasing contents of fluorene segments.

The influence of bipolar moieties’ contents on electroluminescent performance was 
also investigated using P11-based blend devices as an example. The current density and 
luminance versus bias characteristics are shown in Figure 7-11, with the corresponding 
performance data summarized in Table 7-4.The turn-on voltages increase slightly from 3.3 
V to 4.8 V with increasing P11 contents (3 wt%→15 wt%) because hole-blocking effect of 
the bipolar moiety surpasses its enhancement in electron injection.133,138 
To clarify the hole-blocking effect of P11 in the blends, hole-only devices 
[ITO/PEDOT:PSS/(MEH-PPV+ P11)/Au(20 nm)/Al (100 nm)] were fabricated to 
investigate their current density versus bias characteristics. As shown in Figure 7-12, the 
curve shifts horizontally to higher bias as P11’s ratio is increased from 0 to 6 wt%, 
indicating diminished current density under the same bias. For instance, at an electric field 
of 9×105 V/cm the current density decreases from 1000 mA/cm2 to ca. 700 mA/cm2, which 
is obviously due to increased hole-blocking at high P11 contents (6 wt%). The maximum 
luminance and the maximum luminance efficiency of the device are enhanced from 3230 
cd/m2 and 0.29 cd/A to 15690 cd/m2 and 0.81 cd/A, respectively, as the weight ratio of P11 
is increased from 0 to 6 %.

7-4 Summary 
We have successfully synthesized three copolyfluorenes (P9-P11) containing pendant 
bipolar groups (M3 moieties: 2.5, 3.2 and 7.7 mol%). The copolyfluorenes were soluble in 
common organic solvents and thermally stable (Td at 5 wt% loss: 469~482oC and Tg: 
101~120oC). The PL spectra of bipolar model Mb were almost the same whether they were 
excited with absorption maximum of TAZ or CAZ, suggesting efficient intra-molecular 
energy transfer. Moreover, the PL spectra of P9-P11 were identical to that of 
poly(9,9-dihexylfluorene) (PF), due to efficient Förster energy transfer. Estimated LUMO 
and HOMO levels of model Mb were -5.59 eV and -2.79 eV, which are mainly attributed 
to LUMO levels of TAZ and HOMO levels of CAZ, respectively. The HOMO levels of 
PF and P9-P11 were raised gradually from -5.65 eV to -5.61 eV with increasing bipolar 
moieties (from 0 to 7.7 mol%), while their LUMO levels lowered slightly from -2.49 eV to 
-2.55 eV. The device performance of EL device based on MEH-PPV was significantly 
enhanced by blending with the bipolar copolyfluorenes, due to more balanced charges 
recombination in the blends. P11-based blend device (MEH-PPV/P11 = 94/6) showed the 
best performance with maximum luminance of 15690 cd/m2 and maximum luminance 
efficiency of 0.81 cd/A. Current results indicate that the copolyfluorenes containing bipolar 
moieties are promising additives in effectively improving device performance of 
MEH-PPV and other conjugated polymers.

Double-layer electroluminescent (EL) devices, using blends of the bipolar polymers 
and conventional EL polymers (MEH-PPV, d6-PPV), were fabricated to evaluate the 
enhancement of device performance. The performance of MEH-PPV-based device was 
significantly enhanced by blending with the bipolar copolyfluorenes, attributed to more 
balanced charges recombination in the blends. The devices having blends of MEH-PPV 
and P3, P6 or P11 as emitting layers (MEH-PPV/P3 = 95/5, MEH-PPV/P6 = 95/5  and 
MEH-PPV/P11 = 94/6) showed superior performance, with maximum luminance being 
19560, 11090 and 15690 cd/m2 and maximum luminance efficiency being 1.08, 0.56 and 
0.81 cd/A, respectively. In addition, the performance d6-PPV-based devices was 
effectively enhanced by blending with the bipolar copoly(p-phenylene)s owing to 
improved carriers injection and transport. Blend device containing 4% P7 (d6-PPV/P7 = 
96/4) showed the best performance (luminescence efficiency: 0.20 cd/A), which was found 
to be enhanced by a factor of 6.7 with a maximum brightness of 1450 cd/m2.  
Among the blend devices (MEH-PPV/P3 = 95/5, MEH-PPV/P6 = 95/5 and MEH- 
PPV/P11 = 94/6), the blend device with 5 wt% P3 showed the best performance (19560 
cd/m2 and 1.08 cd/A). The EL performance difference is probably due to varied LUMO 
and HOMO energy levels, resulting from different chemical structures and contents of the 
bipolar groups. Accordingly, the significantly enhanced device performance in P3-based 
device is mainly resulted from more balanced charges recombination. 
Current results indicate that the copolyfluorenes (P1-P6 and P9-P11) and 
copoly(p-phenylene)s (P7 and P8) containing bipolar moieties are promising additives in 
improving device performance of conventional MEH-PPV, d6-PPV and other conjugated 
EL polymers. The bipolar moieties, directly linked aromatic 1,2,4-triazole and 
triphenylamine (or carbazole), are effective in balancing carriers injection and transport to 
raise emission efficiency.

    06月27日(星期三) 10:30，我參加由Journal of polymer Science主編所屬實驗室成員
發表利用有機-無機混成的奈米結構，並將其應用於光伏打電池元件中，此種方法能
有效促進元件效能。再者由B. J. Kim發表專題演說，其主要敘述使用熱穩定性的奈米
柱界面活性劑來製造連續式的高分子。13:45-17:30，我聆聽有關於二級非線性光學高
分子與樹枝狀分子的新穎合成策略與設計，對於具有機高分子合成背景的人，啟發頗
深。另一場演講是關於可分解性的polyanhydride材料，將其應用於翻印技術，此技術
能夠成功地完成翻印，並可利用水醇類將template去除。19:40-21:40，參加第三梯次
的壁報展示，會中遇到來自台灣科技大學的助理教授，並短暫交換研究結果。雖然展
示的海報中，與自己相關的領域較陌生，但是經由講解之後，啟發我在研究創新的心
思維。 
    06月28日(星期四)首先出席演講，題目為關於穩定PIN junction在高分子薄膜中的
形成，並探討其應用於有機發光二極體的機制與材料，其次在11:30-11:50聆聽
Poly(p-phenylene vinylenes)(PPV)結構中的缺陷對於有機發光二極體的衝擊與影響，作
者利用 1H NMR光譜來探討其影響元件的機制。11:50-12:10是博後主講的題目
Thermally cross-linkable fluorene-bridged triple-triphenylamines with terminal vinyl 
groups to enhance electroluminescence of MEH-PPV: Synthesis, curing and optoelectronic 
properties，演講時間約17分鐘，結束後有兩位外國朋友提問，第一個問題是關於光學
性質中的光譜，為何在固態狀態下會有些許的紅位移，而另一個問題則由Andrew B. 
Holmes提問關於高分子化學結構中的雙鍵是否完全反應。此外Holmes在英國劍橋大學
時(1990)，在Nature期刊發表了一篇利用共軛高分子為發光材料製作的PLED元件。能
親眼見到Holmes是我的榮幸。雖然只有短暫交談，但我還是收穫良多。下午，參加由
大陸教授L. Wang所發表關於磷光的樹枝狀分子的設計，與其元件發光效能的探討；
以及設計bipolar主體高分子，以有效地提高藍光磷光源見效率。約莫17:40時，我參與
由交通大學應化系教授鄭彥如老師的演講，告訴我們如何設計高效能的有機太陽能高
分子，是相當精采的一場oral presentation。20:00-22:00時，大會為我們準備Banquet，
席間與多位學者專家進行交流。

Title: Synthesis, Characterization and pH-sensory Applications of Novel Organometallic 
Polymers Based on Fluorene-Bridged Bis-benzimidazolylidene 
Abstract Body: To develop new organometallic polymers we synthesized a novel 
fluorene-bridged benzimidazolium salt (BNM ) by successive Suzuki coupling reaction and 
quaternization.Organometallic polymers of platinum (PMPt ) and palladium (PMPd ) were 
prepared via direct ligand-metal coordination. Chemical structures of the polymers were 
characterized by the 1H NMR and FT-IR spectra, and elemental analysis. Their glass 
transition (195 oC, 196oC) and thermal decomposition temperatures (287 oC, 289oC) were
