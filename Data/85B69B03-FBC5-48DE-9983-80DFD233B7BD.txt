Abstract 
This project mainly studies the feasibility of the shop replaceable units or line 
replaceable units (SRU/LRU) for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) onboard information 
systems based on controller area network (CAN).  The kernel objective of the SRU/LRU 
can be defined as the round way communication between the master node and the other 
nodes in the CAN bus.  The round way communication is crucial for CAN system 
because of the inherent constraints of CAN communication.  The mechanism of CAN 
communication has to be changed for SRU/LRU except the network configuration.  In 
this project, we propose a feasible approach to handling the problems of the round way 
communication including the group master architecture and the data communication 
protocol.  Therefore, the environment of the SRU/LRU can be created in CAN bus.  The 
round way communication can be achieved by indirect way.  Besides, the capability of the 
CAN system will be increased and the communication between nodes is not only the data 
signals but the instruction signals.  In addition, we also analyze and assess the 
communication efficiency of this proposed mechanism.  The results show that little 
bandwidth is consumed by this mechanism.  For instance, the bandwidths are around 
0.12% and 0.18% for direct round way communication and indirect round way 
communication, respectively, in case that the baud rate of CAN bus is 250 Kbps.

與載人飛行載具之間的無人飛行載具之內部通訊網路系統。 
本研究主要目的為發展通用型CAN硬體與合適之資料通訊協定應用於無人飛行
載具(Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, UAV)電子裝置，主要目標乃建立線上或廠級替換單元
之環境(Line/Shop Replaceable Unit, LRU/SRU)，而 LRU/SRU 包含資料存取單元與周
邊介面等，其主要功能為存取硬體、感測器、制動器之資訊與可透過資料通訊協定讀
取、更改其硬體資訊等，飛行載具上常使用許多感測器與裝置，除了姿態感測器
(Gyro)、加速規(Acceleromter)外，亦具空速、引擎溫度、GPS 裝置等感測器[5]等，制
動器除油控裝置外，諸如 UAV 各控制面(Control Surfaces)、前視影像擷取鏡頭(Looking 
Forward Camera)及環架(Gimbals)之姿態控制器等，皆可透過 CAN 網路分享資訊，提
高資料傳輸效率，並簡化各感測器及制動器間之連線、減輕通訊連接線束之重量。 
 
3、文獻探討 
CAN 匯流排節點傳送資料訊息為廣播通訊(Broadcast Communication)，以訊息優
先權高低為系統間資訊網路傳輸仲裁機制，因其為分散式架構，可有效降低系統間資
訊網路傳輸之成本，取代原車輛上複雜且笨重之硬體接線[6-10]。文獻[11-13]以 CAN
系統訊息排序(Scheduling Messages)之方法應用即時控制系統，如即時電腦整合製造
(Computer Integration Manufacture, CIM)之應用等，並提出高效率 CAN 系統訊息排序
之設計及實現等論述；文獻 [14]揭櫫 CAN 系統於即時系統應用時之限制，並提出動
態分配可變優先權分配之方法，面對及處理該限制；文獻[15-17] 根據 CAN 系統傳輸
資料時發生錯誤之情形，分析及計算其資料傳輸之響應時間(Response Time)，並改善
CAN 匯流排之資料通訊，降低資料通訊傳輸之錯誤情事；CAN 匯流排亦被實際應用
於電動車輛之車載網路系統 [18,19]，而[19]中亦以 SAE J1939[20-22]規範，應用於電
動客車之車載網路系統；CAN 系統業已廣泛且成功應用於不同之工業領域，可參考
文獻[2,23,24]及其參考之文獻等。 
航空電子元件之可靠度與複雜度更是重要，因此航空電子元件之維修，除了可靠
度之考量外，維修效率更是重要，不但可以降低維修成本，更可提升服務品質，因此
衍生廠級替換單元 (Shop Replaceable Units, SRU)之關念，而就中大型飛行載具而
言，其航空電子元件可能於飛行中失效或故障(如屬重要電子元件，則系統將自動切
換至已開機之備用元件)，系統將通知機師逕行將失效或故障之電子元件抽換，此為
線上替換單元(Line Replaceable Units, LRU)之機制，此機制亦可應用於小型、輕型及
超輕型航空載具或 UAV 等電子元件之維修上，駕駛員或維修人員可依據維修手冊逕
行更換該失效或故障之電子元件，而無需進廠維修，亦可降低維修成本。文獻[25]指
出至公元 2010 年時，SRU/LRU 將成為航空電子系統維修體系之主流概念，作者更強
調航空電子系統之錯誤資料將快速被分析與解譯，因此可提升航空電子系統之維修效
率；文獻[26]及[27]中分別研究 C-17 航空載具之自動測試裝備及嵌入測試機制；文獻
[28]中則探討有關 LRU 航空電子系統之系統錯誤紀錄及回報方法(Fault Recording and 
Reporting Methods)，所提出之方法，針對 LRU 機載航空電子系統之除錯，除可降低
機載航空電子系統之系統錯誤碼的解譯過程外，並可去除提供不必要系統維修的程序
及減少系統維修技術人員；而近年來奈米技術亦應用於 LRU 機載航空電子系統，奈
米級之裝置可取代整片印刷電子板(Print Circuit Board，PCB)，甚或取代組成單一 LRU
之整組 PCB，文獻[29]中針對奈米技術於航空載具之設計及維修的衝擊提出精闢見解
與說明，因此機載航空電子系統 SRU/LRU 之機制的重要性將不言而喻。但對於 CAN
系統可否應用於之機載航空電子之網路系統，端視 CAN 系統可否建立 SRU/LRU 之
機制而定。

吾人可利用資料訊息框架中之資料區域(Data Field)所傳輸的資料，由於考慮
CAN 系統應用時之最飽和情形，本研究將利用資料區域之 8 個位元組，規劃 CAN 系
統之資料通訊協定，該資料通訊協定除可滿足一般數據傳輸外，亦可指定某節點執行
某些指令，如更改該節點之仲裁碼、遮罩、過濾器等，甚或執行透過 ISP 更新節點之
軟體等。首先將具 64 位元之資料區域劃分為 4 個區，分別為格式位元區(Format Bit, 
FB)、目標標識碼區(Destination Identifier, DI)、動作指令碼區(Action Code, AC)、傳輸
資料區(Transmission Data, TD)，如圖 3 所示，其說明如下： 
格式位元區(FB)：格式位元區供佔 1 位元，可分辨與區分二 CAN 匯流排之資料訊息
格式，分別為標準格式及擴展格式。如當位元碼為 0 時(FB=0)，定義匯流排之資料訊
息為標準格式；反之(FB=1)，則定義該資料訊息為擴展格式。 
目標標識碼區(DI)：此區為 CAN 匯流排上之主節點傳送資訊息或指令至目標節點仲
裁碼之數值。其功能主要為當非該目標標識碼之節點收到該訊息時，除群組主節點
外，可不處理該筆資料訊息，而當匯流排上之某節點仲裁碼與目標標識碼區之數值一
致時，則該節點執行該筆資料訊息所代表之指令。

動作指令碼區(AC)：動作指令碼之定義取決於 CAN 系統之應用。舉例而言，若一
CAN 系統應用中少於 256 個動作指令，則資料框架中資料區域之動作指令碼之規劃
可不大於 8 位元。動作指示碼仍有些例外之情況，例如一些特別之動作指令，因其可
能佔用之資料可能大於資料區域所佔之 64 位元，則動作指令碼將有所調整，如改變
擴展格式中 CAN 匯流排上節點之仲裁碼、過濾器或遮罩等，如表 2 所示。 
傳輸資料區(TD)：此區主要為資料之傳輸。在 CAN 匯流排之資料訊息格式為標準格
式時(FB=0)，所傳送之資料範圍可為 1~5 位元組，該數據資料應具足夠之解析度(約
9.0949×10-11 %)；而於擴展格式時(FB=1)，所傳送之資料範圍除更改匯流排上之節點
之仲裁碼、過濾器或遮罩外，其所佔之空間為 1~3 位元組，解析度近似於 5.960×10-6 
%，亦足堪應用於大多數之數據傳輸。

本研究除發展適合建構 SRU/LRU 環境之資料通訊協定及 CAN 匯流排主節點與
其他所有節點之間接雙向通訊外，亦發展適合於機載電子 CAN 系統之通用型單元(如
圖 6 所示)，輸出入介面包括 CAN 介面、數位及類此輸出入介面、串列埠介面等，幾

通用型單元組合如圖 7 所示之通用型單元組，每一通用型單元之軟體均相同，且除
CAN 匯流排主節點外，其他節點內定之仲裁碼、遮罩及過濾器均相同(主節點之軟體
亦可相同，但僅需於 MCU 板上置一開關或跳接閘區分主節點及非主節點)，由主節點
按資料通訊協定傳遞指令至匯流排上之節點，匯流排上之節點一一依照規劃之節點仲
裁碼、遮罩及過濾器更改並將更新之仲裁碼、遮罩及過濾器儲存至延伸唯讀記憶體，
如第四章所述，其中之一通用型單元規劃為 CAN 匯流排主節點，其他單元各規劃為
二群組，每一群組各規劃一單元為該群組之主節點，節點軟體乃根據不同仲裁碼執行
不同指令，則通用型單元之硬體及軟體均完全相同。

三篇均為報告論文。由於報告時間接近，而有些議程亦些微延遲，因此造成論文報告時
極大挑戰，介仙得兩地跑，以免錯過報告時間，所幸兩地相距不甚遠，尚可應付。而聽
講之專家學者，亦不因研討會最後之一報告論文而離開，反而踴躍提問，足見參與者認
真學習的態度。 
 
 
二、與會心得 
日本、韓國、香港及大陸等論文報告佔大部分，日本、韓國之論文報告大多由學生
報告，雖說日韓學生(即便是教授)之英語說得能力不佳，聽得能力更是乏善可陳，但日
韓學生敢於嘗試超過自己能力的挑戰，就具保守性格的東方民族而言，實是難能可貴，
足堪國內學生學習其學習態度，學習總是潛移默化，一蹴可及是不易的，而嘗試超過自
己能力的學習，卻是進步的原動力，反觀國內學生說起英語畏首畏尾，能力絕非低於日
韓學生，但不敢勇於嘗試，我消彼長，依此循環，國家競爭力將每下愈況，另一原因則
是學生(特別是碩士生)參與國際研討會之經費籌措不易，導致學生發表論文之意願降
低，就韓國而言，由於韓國政府大力發展科技及人才培育，碩、博士學生發表國際會議
論文即給予補助，因此直接鼓勵碩、博士學生積極參與國際學術會議，而東亞之國際學
術會議參與之經費不多，且各國之英語能力平平，可建立國內學生之自信，再逐步走向
國際，因此參與東亞之國際學術會議實，應是國內碩、博士學生英語聽說能力之學習及
初試啼聲之場所。吾人實不願見國家競爭力逐年下降，因此常鼓勵學生出國參與國際學
術會議並報告論文，以培育具國際視野之人才。 
 
 
三、建議 
近幾年來，國人參與國際學術研討會的人數正相對地逐年遞減中，早年幾乎都是國
人的人數比率居多，曾幾何時，日本、韓國，乃至大陸的參與人數比率已迎頭趕上，並
早已超越國人參與人數比率，常此以往，國人將會被國際學術研討會邊緣化，因此應鼓
勵並支持國內研究人員積極參與國際學術研討會，以培育具國際視野之人才，建議應給
予參與的學生(包括大學生及碩士生等)適當之經費補助，以資鼓勵。

analyzed as soon as possible and thereby the operational 
readiness would be improved.  The automated test 
equipment (ATE) and the built-in test (BIT) of C-17 were 
studied for the LRU requirements partly in [24] and [25], 
respectively.  The fault recording and reporting method by 
LRU was also studied in [26].  This approach minimizes 
on-aircraft data interpretations, rendering unnecessary 
on-board maintenance processors, and technicians for LRU 
troubleshooting.  Nanotechnology also makes a great 
impact on design and maintenance of aircraft [27].  The 
nanoscaled devices can replace an entire PC board or the set 
of PC board that comprise a LRU.  Similarly, for the 
automotive electronics, SRU/LRU of the CAN also seems to 
be necessary and significant in order to reduce the total 
expenses of the life-cycle for a vehicle.   
This paper proposes a feasible approach to SRU/LRU 
environment creation and realization for CAN systems.  It 
is based on the results presented in [28].  The data 
communication protocol of CAN has been studied to achieve 
the requirements of SRU/LRU.  The mechanism of the 
round-way communication for the master node of CAN has 
also been discussed.  By this mechanism, the master node 
of CAN can transmit and receive the messages to and from 
all other nodes via the CAN bus even though all the filters 
and masks of CAN nodes are not compatible with the node 
ID of the master node.  In this paper, the implementation of 
the proposed mechanism for SRU/LRU will be presented.  
The hardware of each CAN node is recommended to be the 
same, so-called the generic unit, in order to reduce the total 
cost during the system life cycle such as research, 
development, manufacture, and maintenance.  All the 
parameters, including node ID’s, filters, and masks, of CAN 
units can be set and reset by remote unit on-line or by setting 
the dual in-line packages (DIP).  Some kinds of response 
time for the assessments of efficiencies are measured under 
the SRU/LRU environment of the CAN system.  The 
results show that the proposed approach of the round-way 
communication mechanism rarely affects the bandwidth of 
data bus (less than 0.18% bandwidth loss).  The efficiency 
of transmission in CAN bus will be increased in case of the 
appropriate planning of time triggered or event triggered 
mechanism in master node. 
In Section 2, the problem of the SRU/LRU for CAN 
communication is defined and related work is presented.  A 
feasible approach with the data communication protocol is 
proposed to realize the concept of SRU/LRU in Section 3.  
The group master architecture with indirect round-way 
communication is addressed in Section 4.  Section 5 is 
devoted to an implementation of the proposed approach and 
the round-way communication mechanism.  The results 
measured are also assessed in this section. 
2 PROBLEM DEFINITION 
There are four types of frames that can be transferred in 
CAN.  Two are used during normal operation: the Data 
Frame, which is used to transmit local data, and the Remote 
Frame, which is used to request remote data.  Besides, the 
Error Frame signals the detection of error states in CAN, and 
the Overload Frame is used by nodes requiring extra delays 
before the transmission of Data Frames.  The specific fields 
of a Data frame includes Start of Frame (SOF), Arbitration 
Field (or Identifier), Control Field, Data Field, Cyclical 
Redundancy Check (CRC) field, Acknowledgement (ACK) 
Field, and End of Frame (EOF).  CAN has two formats that 
are standard format (standard frame) and extended format 
(extended frame).  The Arbitration Field contains the 11-bit 
and 29-bit message identifiers for standard format and 
extended format, respectively.  In addition, the data field in 
the Data Frames contains 0 to 8 bytes of data. 
Although CAN is widely used for diverse areas of different 
industrial applications, CAN is still a fixed architecture.  
One of the communication restrictions for CAN is that the 
master node of a CAN system can not transmit some 
instructions to all other nodes directly since the arbitration of 
the master node is not always compatible with the masks and 
filters of all other nodes.  The restriction obstructs the 
constructions of the SRU/LRU environment.  One of the 
feasible ways is that the masks of all other nodes canbe set 
to 0.  However, it is impossible for the sake of the 
transmission efficiency and addressing.  The one-way 
transmission for the master node cannot achieve the 
requirements of SRU/LRU.  To sum up, the problem of 
CAN systems can be defined as follows. 
Problem Definition [28]: Is there any mechanism by 
which the master node of CAN not only receives messages 
from but transmits messages to all other nodes in this CAN 
network?
3 DATA COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL FOR 
SRU/LRU  
The data communication protocol is defined as the sentence 
of the transmitted data in data field of the Data Frame in a 
CAN system.  There are no more than 8 bytes in the data 
field in a transmission.  The environment of SRU/LRU can 
be created for CAN systems if the mechanism for the 
round-way communication can be constructed.  Besides, 
the data communication protocol should be compatible with 
two different data formats of CAN since the arbitrations of 
CAN nodes have the standard format and the extended 
format with 112  and 292  possible nodes, respectively.  In 
this paper, all the 8-byte data will be employed in case that 
all possible CAN nodes are available.  The Data Field with 
64 bits can be separated into 4 segments.  These 4 segments 
are defined as Format Bit (FB), Destination Identifier (DI), 
Action Code (AC), and Transmission Data (TD) as shown in 
Figure 1 with standard format and extended format. 
Format Bit (FB): CAN has two formats that are standard 
format and extended format.  FB indicates whether the 
destination node of the CAN network is the standard format 
or the extended format. 
Destination Identifier (DI): DI indicates the arbitration of 
the destination node which the master node of the CAN 
system transmits messages to or requests to act, e.g., to

One node, or the Group Master Node, in a group which can 
transmit data to all other nodes in this group is selected.  Its 
mask and filter are easily set to be compatible with the 
arbitration of the Master Node.  The CAN system won’t be 
changed at all but the values of the masks, filters.  
Furthermore, the software of all Group Master Nodes has to 
be modified appropriately.  The Group Master Node can 
not only receive the messages from the master node but 
transmit messages to all the member nodes in the group.  
The mechanism for the round-way communication has been 
developed via the group master architecture.  It is so-called 
the indirect round-way communication in a CAN system.   
Table 2. Example for the receivability of Master Node and 
Nodes in a group. 
Figure 3. The group master architecture of CAN systems. 
In general, DI and TD can be numbered, or encode, for the 
arbitrations, filters, masks, and other data in CAN systems 
so as to reduce the bit size of transmitted data.  The 
communication efficiency will therefore be improved.  
Although, it is still a kind of the data communication 
protocols of the round-way communication for CAN 
systems in those cases.  In this paper, we would like to 
implement the proposed mechanism in a rigorous situation 
in which all possible nodes in CAN system may be 
approximate to 112  or 292  even though it is impossible in 
applications.  The Master Node is indeed a network 
manager which can transmit messages including some 
instructions or data to or receive such messages from all 
other nodes in the CAN system.  However, the 
communication efficiency of CAN will be traded off. 
5 THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPOSED 
MECHANISM AND ITS EFFICIENCY 
In implementation, a generic unit of CAN units is realized.  
In some applications, the generic unit definitely reduces the 
total expenses of research, manufacture, maintenance, and 
logistic during the system life cycle.  The hardware is 
implemented as shown in Figure 4.  An ISP interfaces is 
reserved for the software updated on-line.  The values of 
the arbitration, mask, and filter of the generic unit can be 
initialized with specific values.  The arbitration, mask, and 
filter of the generic unit can be reassigned from the master 
unit through the data communication protocol remotely.  
The new values of the arbitration, the mask, and the filter 
can be stored in the external memory (XROM) in order to 
initialize as the unit restarts.  The environment of 
SRU/LRU can then be created.
Figure 4. Hardware of generic units for CAN systems. 
In this paper, the major parts of the automotive electronic 
system simulation board contain a turn signal and dimmer 
switch lever, a windshield wiper switch assembly, headlight 
modules, rear lights modules, a wiper motor, a horn switch, 
etc., as shown in Figure 5.  The key feature of the 
simulation board is the toggle switch, or the network switch, 
which can alternate the traditional network with the CAN 
system.  The functions of the CAN system can be verified 
through this switch.  Besides, the terminal panel is utilized 
to connect to other devices. 
Figure 5. The automotive electronic system simulation 
board. 
The devices of the automotive electronic system simulation 
board can be grouped into three parts.  They are headlights, 
rear lights, and wiper system for the Group 1, Group 2, and 
Group 3 in this CAN system, respectively.  Each device has 
a unique identifier which can be controlled by a generic unit.  
The communication among each generic unit can be fulfilled 
through CAN bus as shown in Figure 6.  Actually, in real 
application, there are not necessary to have so many nodes 
in CAN systems.  However, we would like to realization 
the concept of SRU/LRU and to assess the effects in more 
complicated system.  In this system, the TTCAN can be 
utilized to synchronize both the front and rear turn lights. 
One of the applications of SRU/LRU is the ATE function.  
The ATE function is used to make all the nodes in CAN 
systems response the statuses of them.  Master Node cannot 
indeed transmit this message to all nodes directly.  Figure 7 
shows the statuses of ATE function from CAN bus monitor.  
The light color (yellow) circle of the member node in a 
group symbolizes that the request from Master Node for the 
member node has been passed by the Group Master Node.

2and transmits the DTCs’ messages in data bus should be 
considered such as CAN.  For the sake of economy of 
communications, the GPRS is employed not only to transmit 
the DTCs’ messages but the vehicle information. 
In this paper, the integrated system of the prototype is 
established.  It includes the CAN system, the GPRS system, 
and the server system as shown in Figure 1.  The response 
time is the crucial factor in communication.  This paper 
will measure the response time of the CAN system, the 
GPRS system, and the integrated system, respectively.  The 
results show that the response time of the integrated system 
depends on GPRS and the DTC’s number.  The response 
time of GPRS cannot be control since it depends on what 
timeframe it is.  However, the DTC’s number can be 
encoded in order to reduce the time of communication.  
The results also show that it takes more 1.8% time for more 
one DTC which is encoded with 2 bytes for each in 
communication. 
Figure 1.  The integrated system. 
In Section II, the overview of the technologies of the 
systems including CAN, GPRS, etc, are addressed.  The 
integration of these systems is discussed in Section III.  
The performances of CAN, GPRS, and the integrated system 
are assessed in Section IV.  The response time measured is 
also analyzed and discussed in this section. 
2 OVERVIEW OF SUBSYSTEMS 
A vehicle equipped with OBD-II may generate trouble 
signals and light MIL on the instrument panel as trouble 
happens.  The driver should return to the garage or pull 
over to wait for the tow truck.  Lin et al. have presented a 
surveillance system which utilizes MCU with GPRS module, 
GPS module, and OBD scan device.  Their system will 
respond DTCs to the service center as these DTCs are 
generated [6].  The system will help drivers save the repair 
time and solve the troubles of vehicles promptly.  However, 
there are no other vehicle information transmitted except the 
position and DTCs of the vehicle. 
In this paper, we extend the concept in [6] to the system that 
can not only transmit the situations of OBD-II but also the 
other vehicle information with CAN.  The additional 
functions can raise the efficiency and quality of services.  
As shown in Figure 1, the integrated system comprises the 
OBD-II system, GPRS system, and CAN system which will 
be addressed individually as follows.   
2.1 On-Board Diagnostics 
The OBD-II standard allows some different electrical 
interfaces such as J1850 PWM, J1850 VPW [7], and 
ISO-9141 [8].  The interfaces of KWP2000 are also 
approved for OBD-II [9].  The connector of J1962 
conforms to SAE-J1850 at pins 2 and 10 and to ISO 9141 at 
pin 7 and pin 15.  According to SAE J2012 [11], a DTC of 
OBD-II contains five letters.  The first one symbolizes the 
system with malfunctions, i.e., P, B, C and U represent the 
power train (including engine and gearbox), vehicle body, 
chassis, and undefined functions, respectively.  The second 
one indicates where this DTC is defined from.  0 means 
that the DTC complies with the standards of SAE.  1 or 2 
mean that the DTC is defined by manufacturers.  The other 
three letters which are digits are the codes of troubles.  For 
instance, P03xx denotes the DTC is caused from ignition or 
misfire problems.  
2.2 General Packet Ratio Service systems [12-16] 
General Packet Radio Service is a packet based 
communication service for mobile devices that allows the 
data link across a cellular network.  It supports the 
communication based on internet protocols.  The bit rate of 
transmissions is around 56–118 kbps in application however 
the theoretical bit rate is 171.2 kbps which may be attainable 
with standard GSM time slots.  GPRS enables the internet 
applications and services.  The infrastructure of GPRS and 
GSM is very well in Taiwan.  It is not necessary to develop 
another wireless communication network.  Besides, the rate 
of GPRS depends on the packet number transmitted while 
that of GSM depends on the time of connection.  GPRS is, 
no doubt, cheaper than GSM as they are always on. 
2.3 Controller Area Network 
CAN provides the cost-effective communication network of 
in-vehicle electronics as an alternative to the expensive and 
cumbersome wiring looms [17-21].  CAN conforms to the 
open systems intercommunication model which is defined in 
terms of physical layers.  A message transmitted in CAN 
has an identifier, or arbitration, which is unique to the 
network system and serves two purposes: a priority 
assignment for the transmission and message filter upon 
reception.  In other words, it controls both bus arbitration 
and message addressing.  CAN is a broadcast 
communication with priority-based access to the medium.  
Its communication protocol has become a data transmission 
standard in automotive applications.  This protocol 
implements a priority-based bus with a carrier sense multiple 
access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) to control 
access to the bus.  Nowadays, CAN is widely used not only 
for vehicles but for diverse areas of different industrial 
applications such as agricultural machinery, medical 
instrumentation, elevator controls, fairground rides, public 
transportation systems, industrial automation, home 
automation [22,23], real-time remote control [24], etc.  It is 
standardized as ISO 11898 for high-speed applications 
(1Mbps) and ISO 11519-2 for low-speed applications 
(125Kbps).

Frame in CAN.  The response time measurements for CAN 
can be referred to [25] for details. 
Figure 5. The tracks of the vehicle. 
Figure 6. The response time measurements of CAN. 
4.2 The response time measurement of GPRS 
The response time of GPRS is defined as the time interval 
between a packet transmitted from GPRS module to the 
server system with a specified IP in internet and the signal 
which is transmitted from this server system received by 
GPRS module.  Figure 7 depicts the architecture of the 
response time measurements of GPRS.  The values of 
response time measured are the average of successive 500 
times for transmission and receiving.  There are four 
timeframes measured in this paper.  They are morning 
(08:30~09:30), noontime (11:30~12:30), evening 
(17:00~18:00), and midnight (23:30~00:30).  Table 1 and 
Figure 8 list and show the measured values of the response 
time of GPRS with different number of DTCs and 
timeframes, respectively.  
Figure 7. The architecture of the response time 
measurements of GPRS. 
4.3 The response time measurement of the integrated 
system 
The response time of the integrated system is the time 
interval between the time when CAN Node 1 starts to 
transmit DTCs to CAN Node 2 which sends the message to 
the server system via GPRS module and the time when CAN 
Node 1 receives the signal of completion from CAN Node 2 
after CAN Node 2 receives the signal from the server system 
via GPRS module.  The measurements are similar to those 
of GPRS.  They also include four timeframes with different 
number of DCTs.  Table 2 is the measured values of the 
response time.  In addition, Figure 9 sketches these 
measured values.

Figure 8. The response time of GPRS. 
It takes short time for the communication in CAN compared 
with the integrated system, i.e., the communication in CAN 
is not crucial for the efficiency of the integrated system.  
The decisive factor is the transmission between GPRS and 
the server system.  Figures 8 and 9 show that the response 
time at midnight is better than that in noontime since the 
GPRS and internet systems are busier in noontime than other 
timeframes.  Nevertheless, the integrated system has to 
work even the busiest hour.  The infrastructure of GPRS 
systems is very well in Taiwan and the measured data are 
reliable.  Therefore, the system engineers can take account 
of these data when they design such proximate systems.  
The number of DTCs is also a factor that affects the 
communication efficiency since it theoretically takes more 
1.8% (|2/112) time for one more number of DTCs between 
CAN Node 2 and GPRS module.  It is suggested that the 
DTCs may append to one of the vehicle information packets 
transmitted by GPRS.  The DTCs can be arranged 
sequentially in a packet and this will further the 
communication efficiency.

of wheels.  The kinematics and the dynamics of unturned 
traction wheels are analyzed for a vehicle.  The steering 
control can be achieved by the appropriate differences of the 
rotation speeds of the left and right unturned traction wheels.  
The contact model for rigid wheels on ground will be 
discussed based on the terramechanics.  The forces 
generated from these two traction wheels are tabled for 
different slip ratios and sideslips.  A case will be studied to 
determine the rotation speeds of these two wheels for a 
vehicle which curves a path with a constant radius in steady 
states.   
In Section 2, the kinematic model of a vehicle is derived.  It 
will extend to the vehicles with the unturned traction wheels.  
It includes the acceleration of the vehicle, the angular 
velocity of yaw and its acceleration.  The traction force 
model is studied in Section 3.  Moreover, the database of 
the forces is created with slip ratios and sideslip angles.  
Section 4 will apply the database of forces and the analyses 
to an example in steady states.   
    
2 KINEMATIC MODEL OF A VEHICLE 
To analyze the dynamics of unturned wheels, we commence 
with the nonholonomic kinematic model of a vehicle.  We 
would like to generate the kinematic model for the general 
cases, i.e., the wheels can turn independently.  A kinematic 
model of a 4 wheel vehicle is shown in Figure 1.  
Furthermore, the sideslip ( 0E ) of the vehicle and the lateral 
slip ( iE ) of wheels are also included.  The turn angles ( i\ )
of wheels can be set to zero in case of unturned wheels.  
There are some assumptions should be made for the 
nonholonomic kinematic model of a vehicle. 
A) The vehicle is rigid and the distances between wheels are 
also fixed strictly. 
B) The steering axle of each wheel is perpendicular to the 
terrain. 
In Figure 1, iE , i\ , and iv*  denote the sideslip, the 
turning angle (yaw), and the velocity vector of the vehicle as 
i=0, and the lateral slip, the turning angle, and the moving 
velocity vector of each wheel as i=FL, RL, RR, FR. ixv

Based on (8), the traction/brake forces and the side forces 
can be calculated for different contact surfaces such as snow, 
clayey soil, sandy loam, and dry sand as shown Figure 6.

4 A CASE STUDY 
This section will apply the data of forces including the 
tractions/brakes and side forces to an example of a vehicle 
with unturned traction wheels.  The dynamics of the steady 
state as the vehicle which curves a path with constant radius 
is simulated.  The simulation is based on the previous 
unturned wheels analysis and traction force model of single 
wheel.  A vehicle with mass 124.4kg and 6.14 zzI kg-m2
moves in speed 2m/s.  The parameters of the vehicle are 
adopted from [11] as shown in Table 1 except the four-wheel 
structure and the front traction wheels.  Moreover, the four 
wheels are all unturned.
