Part 1 Properties of CeO2 Based Electrolytes 
 
I. Introduction of CeO2 Based Electrolytes 
A fuel cell is a kind of device which can converse chemical energy to electron 
directly without associated mechanical energy loss. The electricity can be generated 
from fuel (on the anode side) and an oxidant (on the cathode side), which react in the 
presence of an electrolyte as shown in Fig. 1. [1] The reactants flow into the cell, and 
the reaction products (e-, H2O, etc.) flow out of it. Fuel cells can operate almost 
continuously as long as the necessary supply of reactants is maintained. Recently, 
solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) has been developed intensively due to the characters of 
clean, noiseless and high power generation efficiency. Generally, the efficiency of a 
single SOFC device is around 60% [2] or to 85% theoretical maximum in hybrid 
systems1. For SOFCs, oxygen ions diffuse through a solid oxide electrolyte material 
such as ZrO2- or CeO2-based systems at high temperature to react with fuel such as H2 
on the anode side. Comparing to the other fuel cells, such as direct methanol fuel 
(DMFC) and proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), SOFCs can adapt 
variety of fuels, e.g., H2, C2H8, CO.  
    Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is most common material used as an electrolyte 
in transitional SOFCs, but need operation temperature is around 1173-1273 K [2]. 
However, several issues should be overcome because of such high operation 
temperature. Such as the reactions between components, the selection of sealing 
materials, thermal degradation and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch 
to electrolyte. Thus, reducing the operating temperature of the SOFCs has come to be 
stringent. The advantages of lower operation temperature are flexibility in choosing 
the types of electrodes, lower limiting of sealing materials, cheaper interconnect metal

zirconia-based oxide. Fig. 3 compares the electrical conductivities of some potential 
materials, including yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) [23,24], 20GDC [16], 
La1-xSrxGa1-yMgyO3-δ (LSGM) [25], and Bi3NbO7-Bi3YO6 [26] systems. It should be 
noted that all the samples comparing in Fig. 3 were bulky specimens. The 
conductivity of 20GDC (20 mol% Gd) is about one order higher than that of 8YSZ, 
especially in the temperature lower than 600oC.  
Additionally, some materials, such as LSGM or bismuth-based systems perform 
higher conductivity than YSZ and GDC. But several problems have to face, such as 
hard to get a pure pervoskite LSGM phase, or reduction of Bi2O3 materials. LSGM 
and Bi-based electrolytes rarely use for SOFCs.  
For a commercial SOFC, the basic electrical conductivity requirement should be 
higher than 0.01 S/cm. A dotted curve as shown in Fig. 3 presents the electrical 
conductivity equal to 0.01 S/cm, which suggests the operation temperature for YSZ 
system normally higher than 850oC or than 700oC in dry O2 condition, and higher 
than 550oC for LSGM or 20GDC systems. For the requirement of conductivity the 
lower operation temperature is possible to achieve by reducing the thickness of 
electrolyte to submicron or nanometer scale. Therefore, the development of anode or 
cathode supported SOFCs is favorable. 
The key factor concerned for electrolyte is its ionic conductivity, which is 
controlled by the concentration of oxygen vacancies and the mobility of the oxygen 
ion. The sources of oxygen vacancies are resulting from the extrinsic addition of 
aliovalent oxides, such as Gd2O3 and Sm2O3. The defect reaction of the dissolution of 
any tri-valent element (e.g., Ln-series) into CeO2 lattice can be represented by 
Kroger-Vink notation as follow:

stabilized zirconia, the reduction behavior of doped ceria, Ce4+ to Ce3+ or to metallic 
Ce, in combine with the following reduction equation, made the electrolyte 
semi-conductive.

The reduction of ceria shows n-type conductive behavior. The electric current flowing 
through the CeO2 electrolyte, instead of open circuit, lowers the terminal voltage than 
the theoretical value, and further reduces the output power efficiency of SOFC. As the 
increase of electronic conductivity resulting from the reduction of cerium ions, the 
ionic transference number (ti) decreases.  
Tuller and Nowick [31] found the linear relationship between oxygen partial 
pressure and reciprocal temperature at different ti values of yttria doped ceria (YDC). 
Their study reported that the oxygen partial pressure difference between ti = 0.99 and 
ti = 0.9 is about four orders. The ti value of the YDC could reach to 0.99 only when 
the oxygen partial pressure higher than 10-6 atm at 800oC, but this pressure could drop 
to about 10-21 atm at 450oC as shown in Fig.5. 
    In order to fabricate ceria-based electrolyte thin film, there are numerous 
methods has been reported, including  
    ■ electrodeposition [19,30],  
■ electrophoretic deposition (EPD) [12],  
■ chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [33,34],  
■ metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), [35],  
■ pulsed laser deposition (PLD) [13,24],  
■ tape-casting [9,20],  
■ spray pyrolysis or spray coating [7,10,17],  
■ screen-printing [4],

dopant oxide.  
The calculated lattice parameter and those estimated from Kim’s relation are 
plotted as Fig. 8.  It can be seen from the above diagram that, the lattice parameters 
for doped CeO2 deviates largely from the empirical relations. Especially for Gd – 
doped case, the experimental measured lattice constant expanded while the calculated 
is shrunk. The unnatural lattice strain in response to doping process may affect the 
tendency of defect clustering. 
In conclusion, the reason for the deviation of the conductivity-dopant ionic 
radius from experimental results may arise from the non-optimized inter-atomic 
potential, .which can also be reflected from the calculated lattice parameter.

Abstract 
Fibrous ceria particulates, which are an important ionic material used for solid 
electrolyte, have been synthesized by a new chemical co-precipitation/ripening 
method. Aqueous nitrate solutions containing NaOH/C6H8O7 are used to grow Gd- 
and Sm-doped ceria fibers. The growth mechanism and microstructural properties of 
the fibers are investigated. Other than fibers, three precipitates either in spherical 
colloids, flaky, or stick-in-bundle morphologies are also obtained by similar precursor 
solutions. The morphologies of those precipitates are greatly affected by the 
concentrations ratio of the Ce(NO3)3/NaOH/C6H8O7. The fibrous feature is retained 
by calcination up to 1200oC in 1 hr. Reaction kinetics and the chemical composition 
of the fibers are reported.

pure and doped ceria fibers in Ce-nitrate solution. Beside fibers, the other precipitates, 
such as flake-shaped or spherical colloidal particles, could be synthesized in the 
similar starting solutions. In addition, the synthesis kinetics of the fibers and the 
calcined products are also investigated. 
 
2. Precipitation and Particle Ripening 
Pure, Gd-doped, and Sm-doped CeO2 fibers were synthesized by chemical 
co-precipitation/ripening method in aqueous solution. The starting materials were 
cerium (III) nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, 99.5%, ACROS, U.S.A.), 
gadolinium (III) nitrate hexahydrate (Gd(NO3)3·6H2O, 99.5%, ACROS, U.S.A.), 
samarium (III) nitrate hexahydrate (Sm(NO3)3·6H2O, 99.5%, ACROS, U.S.A.), 
sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 96%, Showa Chemical Co. Ltd., Japan), and anhydrous 
citric acid (C6H8O7, 99.5%, ACROS, U.S.A.). 
Two starting concentrations, 0.025 mc and 0.1 mc (molar concentration, moles of 
solute per kilogram solvent) of Ce3+ ions were used in this study. The formulas are 
listed in Table 1. A solution of Ce(NO3)3 was first dissolved in citric acid solution. 
Then NaOH was added into the mixture at a specified ratio of [NaOH]:[citric acid]. 
The solution mixture was then aged at 90oC for 24 hr until precipitates were obtained. 
Four types of precipitates were noted, including colloidal particles, fibers, 
stick-in-bundles, and flakes. Cerium hydrocarbonate fibers were further thermally 
treated at 300oC to 1200oC to form ceria fibers. Gd-doped or Sm-doped CeO2 fibers 
were fabricated with the same procedure except the addition of either Gd(NO3)3 or 
Sm(NO3)3 in the starting solution, of which the molar ratios of Ce3+:Gd3+ and 
Ce3+:Sm3+ were kept at 4:1. 
There are three kinds of Ce precipitates obtained after 24 hr aging at 90oC, 
including fibrous, flake-shaped, and stick-in-bundle precipitates, as shown in Figs. 1 
and 2. In the synthesis of fibrous precipitates, morphological changes of the solutions 
during the aging period were noted. The colorless transparent solution first turned to 
turbid suspension in less than 1 hr. As the solution ages, the suspension formed some 
precipitates which settled to the bottom of container, and the supernatant solution 
became transparent. The sediment, which covered the entire bottom of the glass 
container, underwent the next transition from porous precipitates to loose 
 34
3. Kinetic Analysis of Fiber Synthesis 
Figure 4 shows the doped Ce hydrocarbonate fibrous precipitates obtained with 
the additives of Gd3+ and Sm3+, respectively. There are no apparent effects of the 
additives on the fibrous morphology. The result of quantitative analysis of two fibers 
calcined at 1000oC is listed in the figure. The contents of Gd3+ and Sm3+ in doped Ce 
fibers are 17.3 mol% and 16.0 mol%, respectively, less than the original quantities of 
20 mol%. Loss of Gd and Sm was noted for both doping systems due to differential 
precipitation reaction rates of Gd- and Sm-species compared with Ce-species.  
The reaction (deposition) rate of Gd3+ and Sm3+ ions compared with Ce3+ ions is 
responsible for this content deficiency. The residual concentration of metallic ions 
(Ce3+, Gd3+, and Sm3+) in the supernatant of the synthesis solution was analyzed by 
inductive coupled plasma spectroscopy with atomic emission (ICP-AES, JOBIN 
YVON, Ultima 2000, France). Figure 5 shows the linear decrease in [Ce3+] and [Gd3+] 
contents, indicating that the reaction is of zero-order. The deposited fractions of Ce3+ 
and Gd3+ ionic concentrations from the solution at 7 hr (the turn points in Fig. 5) are 
91% and 84%, respectively. 
The residual [Ce3+] in three supernatants of the samples (samples 1, 14, and 10 in 
Fig. 3, growing various Ce precipitates) were also analyzed by ICP-AES. The results 
are shown in Fig. 6, revealing various time-dependent behaviors of [Ce3+] content. 
Sample 1 kept constant precipitation rate until the concentration of [Ce3+] turned 
constant at 450 ppm after 10-hr aging. The reaction rate of this zero-order reaction 
was independent on the concentrations of reactants. As a result, the reaction time is 
the only controlling factor for the residual concentration. The relationship between 
residual concentration and time could be expressed as follows. 
k
dt
CdR =−= ][  (1) 
where R is the reaction rate, [C] is the residual content of [Ce], t is the reaction time, 
and k is the reaction rate coefficient. In this investigation, the units of [C], t, and k 
were ppm, hr, and ppm/hr, respectively. Integrating Eq. (1) yields the following 
equation: 
)(][][ 00 ttkCC t −−=  (2) 
where [C]t is the reactant concentration at time t, [C]0 is the original reactant 
concentration, and t0 is the starting time which is normally zero. The linear 
relationship between [C]t and t is obtained for Fig. 6. The minus slope of [C]t plotted 
 36
has been well documented by Greenwood. [8] The growing time (t) to the aspect ratio 
of the fiber ( 33 oASAS − ) shows a linear relationship as below. 
)(33 oo ttkASAR −=−            (3) 
where to is the initial time of fiber growth (7.3 hr in this case), ARo is the aspect ratio

diffusivity of Ce species in the saturated solution at the growing temperature. 
  
4. Phase and Morphology of Ce-Fibers 
The crystalline phases of various precipitates were analyzed by X-ray diffraction 
(XRD, Philips PW1830, Philips Instrument Corp., the Netherlands) using Cu Kα 
radiation, at a scanning rate of 4o/min. The applied voltage and current were 40 kV 
and 30 mA, respectively. Figure 8 shows the XRD patterns of pure, Gd3+-doped, and 
Sm3+-doped Ce green fibers. These patterns indicated the similar crystalline phases 
(Ce(CO3)3, Ce(OH)3 and residual citric acid crystals) of hydrocarbonate fibers. 
However, a few peaks belonging to hydrous crystals could not be differentiated.  
In the following sections, only GDC fibers were chosen for thermal 
decomposition tests. Figure 9 shows that hydrocarbonate fibers transforms to oxide if 
calcined above  300oC. The figure shows an endothermic peak at 150-200oC, and an 
obvious exothermic peak above 250oC. These two peaks are in agreement with the 
two stages of mass loss during thermal treatment in DTG results. The first 
endothermic peak corresponds to the loss of physically adsorbed water. The second 
peak is the transformation of hydrocarbonate into oxide, resulting in an extremely 
strong exothermic reaction (or burning) between 250oC and 350oC. It indicates that 
the combustion of hydrocarbonate fibers occurs in this temperature range. Therefore, 
the thermal treatment of the hydrocarbonate fibers should be carefully controlled, 
either by very slow ramping rate (as slow as 1 oC/min), or holding at temperatures 
below 250oC (e.g. 220oC) before reaching the maximal exothermic temperature, so to 
avoid rapid combustion. 
Figure 10 shows XRD patterns of GDC fibers thermal-treated at several 
temperatures. The decomposition of hydrocarbonate fibers had not yet started at 
200oC, and still showed an amorphous state. The crystallization of CeO2 phase could 
be observed when calcined at 300oC. No other phases remained after calcination. 
According to Scherrer formula, the crystalline size of GDC fibers was growing from 3

Abstract 
The ionic diffusion of 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia (8YSZ) was investigated using 
atomistic simulation. The well-known inverse relation between oxygen conductivity 
and temperature is reproduced for a wide range of temperatures (623~1500 K). A strong 
defect clustering between oxygen vacancies and trivalent yttrium ions was statistically 
and graphically explained by the simulated results, especially at lower temperatures (< 
823 K). Oxygen migration exhibited less effective at lower temperature, suggesting that 
the diffusion of oxygen was localized by jumping back-and-forth through specific 
lower-energy-barrier paths. Static lattice calculations further confirmed the favorable 
diffusion routes, of which two adjacent oxygen sites had two or more common 
second-nearest-neighbor yttrium atoms.

activation enthalpy when the temperature is below 823 K. [14, 15] Although this 
phenomenon is widely regarded as the result of strong defect association, its 
underlying microscopic mechanisms have not been carefully studied. In this work, we 
aim to investigate oxygen jumping mechanism and defect interaction in widely varied 
temperatures using molecular dynamics simulation. 8 mol% Y2O3 doped ZrO2 is used 
because abundant experimental data (both electrical conductivity or tracer diffusion 
studies) can be found for comparison. 
 
2. Simulation Details 
Molecular dynamics simulations were performed using the DL_POLY package. 
[16] The yttria-doped zirconia material was considered as a rigid-ion model with 
pairwise interatomic potentials. The potential consists of an electrostatic term for 
long-range interaction and a short-range term with Buckingham form: 
 6( ) exp( )ρ= − −ij
r CV r A
r
           (1) 
where the first term represents the repulsive potential arose from overlap of electron 
clouds and the second term is the dispersion energy. The potential parameters A , ρ , 
and C  were taken from the work of Schelling et al. [17]. 
A simulation box consisting of 4x4x4 unit cells of cubic ZrO2 with periodic 
boundary conditions was set-up. A part of Zr atoms were randomly substituted with Y 
atoms. Meanwhile, some oxygen atoms were removed to create oxygen vacancies, 
with the number corresponding to the 8 mol% yttria contents. The positions of 
zirconium to be substituted by Y and oxygen to be removed were selected randomly. 
In addition, five simulations with different initial atomic configurations were 
performed at each temperature. Simulation was performed under constant 
 56
The MSD of oxygen at different temperatures is shown in Fig. 1. The linearity 
of the MSD–time relation is much apparent at 1273 K than 623 K. At 623 K the MSD 
arises rapidly at the beginning, and then increases steadily but with a large fluctuation. 
At the temperatures lower than 623 K, such fluctuation influences the slope of MSD 
so greatly that the calculated D value depends strongly on the time interval. As a 
result, D values at T <623K were thus not calculated. For similar reasons, diffusivity 
calculations were performed with an equilibrium time of 1 ns and total 5 ns simulation 
time for those cases with temperatures above 823K, while 4 ns and total 20 ns for 
those with temperatures below 823 K.  
The electric conductivity can be calculated from the classical Nernst-Einstein 
relation:

=σ           (4), 
where σ  corresponds to the dc conductivity, n  the concentration of charge carriers, 
and q  the electric charge. The subscript i denotes a specific charge carrier. The 
simulated Arrhenius plot is shown in Fig. 2. The calculated and experimental 
conductivity, and activation enthalpy are listed in Table 1. Simulation results show a 
slightly higher activation enthalpy at lower temperatures (<823 K). Similar trend was 
found for electric conductivity. Nevertheless, care must be taken while simulation 
results at low temperatures are interpreted. Large error bar at low temperatures is due to 
a greater fluctuation of the MSD–time relation as shown in Fig 1(b). Such time-scale of 
longer than 20 ns is necessary, but laborious. Several trials and longer time scale are 
computationally feasible for this simulation at low temperature.

investigated below through the analysis of oxygen jumping mechanisms. 
 
3.3 Oxygen Migration 
 Based on the 3-D random-walk theory, the self-diffusivity of oxygen ( oD ) in 
zirconia can be represented as follows:  
2 2
o v[ ] [ ] [ ] exp expo o o
S HD V D V V
k kT
γλ γλ ν⋅⋅ ⋅⋅ ⋅⋅ Δ −Δ⎛ ⎞ ⎛ ⎞= = Γ = ⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟⎝ ⎠ ⎝ ⎠         (5) 
where vD  is known as the diffusivity of oxygen vacancies,  [ ]oV
⋅⋅  is the 
concentration of  oxygen vacancies, γ  denotes the geometric factor ( 1
6
γ =  for a 
simple cubic oxygen sublattice), λ  represents the jumping distance of an atom in a 
single jumping event, ν is the lattice vibrational frequency, SΔ  and HΔ are entropy 
and enthalpy change involved in the jumping process of an oxygen vacancy, 
respectively and Γ  corresponds to the frequency of jumping of an oxygen vacancy. 
Herein, we are reporting the analysis on the dependence of Γ  to temperature. 
The calculated Γ  was found to be influenced by temperature only, and almost 
remain constant within ensemble simulation. However, to further explore the 
mechanism of diffusion, it is necessary to know the percentage of the forward jumps 
(effective jumps) among the observed jumps. The calculated frequency of jumping 
and the percentage of forward jumps are listed in Table 3. The backward jumping 
tends to be more dominant at lower temperatures.  The temperature dependence of 
diffusivity D  and jumping frequency Γ  is shown in Fig. 4. The calculated 
activation enthalpy from D  ( DHΔ ) and Γ ( H ΓΔ ) is listed in Table 4. The results 
show that the slope obtained from D  and Γ (i.e., DHΔ  and H ΓΔ ) are 
incommensurate. The former is considered the overall effective migration enthalpy 
 60
Zr-Zr path is the lowest. Therefore, the pump through Zr-Zr edge is expected to be the 
most dominant route over the others, as had also been suggested by Kilo et al.. [8]  
We also repeated this investigation on the fraction of three jumping paths at 
different temperatures, and reported in Fig. 6. The fraction of jumping via Zr-Zr path is 
much higher than that of the others, by the consideration of either random-walk or 
effective jumping. Furthermore, the fraction of the jumping via Zr-Y and Y-Y paths 
increases as the temperature, which is consistent with our expectation that three 
jumping routes are thermal activated independently.  
As mentioned in Section 3.2 that the oxygen sites with the Y ion at 
second-neighbor are preferentially “vacancy binding sites,” in which vacancies are 
preferably trapped in these sites at lower temperatures. Furthermore, the vast majority 
of oxygen jumping (Table 3) at lower temperatures can be noted to be “backward 
jumping”, indicating poor efficiency of the oxygen migrations. If the migration relates 
to energy barrier especially at lower temperatures, the atomic configurations 
constituting different symmetries (for both back and forth directions) should be 
considered. For this reason, we postulated that two adjacent vacancy-binding sites (i.e. 
oxygen sites types 1 and 2, discussed in section 3.2) with one or more SecNN Y atoms 
may influence the activation energy for oxygen-vacancy jumping. Figure 5 illustrates 
that two nearby oxygen sites (one is vacant) share 4 common SecNN cations. Thus total 
six possible arrangements of neighbor cations, which include 0-4 common SecNN Y 
atoms.  
Investigation was taken into the fraction of oxygen-vacancy exchange with 
different number surrounding SecNNY (denoted as #_SecNNY) at different 
temperatures. The results are shown in Fig. 7. The fraction of 0_SecNNY exchange is 
lower than the cases of 1_SecNNY and 2_SecNNY. This is consistent to the fact that 
 62
were analyzed in statistical and graphical points of view, and can be summarized as 
below. 
1. Defect analysis shows that oxygen vacancies are stabilized when they are in the 
sites surrounding with 2nd-nearest neighbor Y atoms. Furthermore, this tendency is 
more apparent at lower temperatures, which is consistent to the experimental 
observations that the activation enthalpy slightly increases as temperature is lower 
than 823 K.  
2. In the oxygen jumping analysis, the frequency of the jumping exhibits a less 
dependence to the temperature than the oxygen self-diffusivity. At lower 
temperatures, slow oxygen migration is due to prevail “backward jumping”, which 
does not contribute to the diffusion process.  
3. Lower enthalpy of jumping frequency ( H ΓΔ ), low fraction of forward (effective) 
jumping, and strong vacancy bonding effect at lower temperatures suggest that the 
diffusion of oxygen does transport via low-energy-barrier paths. The paths with two 
to three surrounding second-nearest-neighbor Y atoms exhibit much higher fraction 
of effective exchange of oxygen with vacancies than that predicted by random-walk 
diffusion. Some atomic configurations constituting 2_SecNNY paths have lower 
energy barriers than that via the paths with 0_SecNNY and 1_SecNNY.

2.2.1 粉體合成(powder synthesis)與製程 
     來自瑞典 ETH 的 U.T. Gonzenbach 博士介紹陶瓷顆粒如何形成穩定泡沫，
用於多孔、低密度隔熱材料，或是催化劑載體。其技術是控制膠體(colloids)陶瓷
顆粒表面潤濕角，當陶瓷顆粒吸附在雙相泡沫介面，其介面自由能(如下式)遠高
於 surfactant 的值(1-3 kT)。由鹼(pH=12)到酸所使用的介面潤濕劑(amphiphile)為 
carboxylic acid (pK=4.76) alkyl galates(pK=8.94)，或是 alkyl amines，添加濃度 1-5 
μmol/m2.

經由表面能，activity 幾個參數，合理得到球形奈米顆粒成長預測。 
 英國 Leeds 大學的研究生 M. Ward 報導具有奈米氧化錳顆粒的 TEM 分析結
果，他的觀察中錳金屬，兩價及三價氧化錳均可以 EELS 分辨，殘留應力則由觀
察 Morie 干涉條紋可以得知。 
 另一場邀請演講是由日本 Keio 大學 Senna 教授介紹合成鈦酸鋇固態反應採
用前驅粉體(碳酸鋇)的種種熱分析結果，觀察到兩階段反應，第一階段發生於
790oC，形成 30 nm 晶核，第二階段屬成長過程。添加 glycerin 有降低第一階段

三、 建議 
3.1 紐倫堡 Messe 會場是一超大、現代化展覽暨開會會場，其外觀及內部(如
下面附圖) 設計先進，會場環境舒適，難得一見的開會場地。其設計值得國內未
來新建國際會議場地參考。 
3.2 會議資訊充分，也能在會前即時傳給參加人，報到次序井然有序，會場
進出控制有效。也非常值得借鏡。 
 
  
四、攜回資料 
    EuroMat 2007 會議手冊一份。 
 
 
一粒徑、次微米之氧化銦球形顆粒，用於光閘晶體(Photonic bandgap crystal)組合
之用。因為氧化銦具有 n 型半導特性，若要做為光子晶體的材料，需要緻密、粒
徑均一的次微米球體。為了合成理想球體，本研究將起始物的濃度、反應溫度、
以及相關之實驗參數影響作一有系統之探討。本研究中加入重要的晶面調整劑：
檸檬酸(citric acid)，或酒石酸、蘋果酸等 3 或 2 羧基之果酸，可使含銦之析出物
生成球狀體。析出物及其經煆燒後的微結構、晶相以及熱性質則使用掃瞄式或穿
透式電子顯微鏡、熱分析系統以及Ｘ光繞射儀等予以分析之。反應動力學的研究
發現，此析出反應為一零級反應，且反應速率是受反應溫度以及尿素之分解所控
制，而檸檬酸之添加量對控制粒徑有線性之關係。 
 
    (3) 鎳-鈦酸鋇基多層電容補氧前後之微結構分析。以卑金屬(鎳)為電極的多
層陶瓷電容是當今最重要的電子模組中的被動元件。由於鎳電極很容易再氧化，
所以 MLCC 元件必須在極度還原氣氛下進行共燒。但是所產生的鈦酸鋇會有還
原情況，使介電性質變差。所以利用燒結後熱處理來幫助鈦酸鋇補氧，處理過程
中鎳仍可能發生氧化，所以補氧過程的熱處理溫度及時間必須被嚴格的控制。本
研究主要觀察補氧前後，電極的連續性的改變；並利用 SEM 和 TEM 來分析氧
化層的型態與結晶性。結果顯示補氧之後，鎳電極的不連續發生於產生氧化的部
位，此氧化層厚度約 0.3-0.8μm，沿著介面生長的此氧化層為多晶的 rhombohedral
結構。而形成氧化的機制將在此研究中一併探討。 
 
  (4) 奈米氧化陶瓷顆粒之水合動力學。建築外牆的瓷磚因暴露在空氣和酸雨
中而產生劣化脫落，這與瓷磚表面的水合有關。本篇論文有兩個主要探討的方
向：其一是研究陶瓷粉體面的水合動力學和量測表面所帶的 OH 鍵密度。發現在
弱酸的水溶液中，陶瓷粉體表面的 OH 鍵密度對同種氧化物是一樣的，並且到達
飽和水合時間約略相同。氧化鋁、氧化矽和氧化鎂表面的飽和 OH 鍵密度分別是
8.5，3.5 和 66 OH/nm2。其二是比較氧化物水合反應在酸性下和鹼性下的水合行
為，在鹼性(pH=11)下，水合飽和的時間不再一致。三種氧化物在室溫的水合速
率將予以報導。 
 
  (5) 用於固態燃料電池封裝玻璃之 Ba-B-Si-Al-氧化物玻璃材料。BaO-B2O3- 
SiO2-Al2O3 玻璃系統已被廣泛接受，可作為適用在中溫型固態氧化物燃料電池中
的柔性封裝接合材。在這次研究中主要可分成兩個主題，首先是玻璃之合成與性
質 測 定 。 基 本 熱 性 質 以 及 其 結 晶 行 為 、 潤 濕 行 為 之 觀 察 。 其 中 ， 以
45.45BaO-20B2O3-25.45SiO2-9.09Al2O3 (G1A10) 其玻璃工作溫度為 625-830oC，
最適用於工作溫度為 650-800oC 的中溫型燃料電池中。另一方面，玻璃系統與金
屬雙極連接板(Crofer 22APU)和陶瓷電解質部分的介面反應現象也同時被探討。 
在 Crofer 22APU/G1A10 界面處所生成的氧化鉻層，可阻隔 Crofer 22APU 內部的
鉻及鐵離子繼續擴散至玻璃內部；另一方面，8YSZ/G1A10 界面處會生成一
的 ZeuSII 燃料電池計畫，只要是建置附屬動力系統(accessory power supply 
system)，共有十個研究單位或公司參與。工程目標如下，均已達成： 
 <5 kW，<50 kg 重，體積<50 公升。10 分鐘內達到至少 30%能量輸出，操作
溫度>600-700oC 有 30%輸出，800oC 全輸出(full power output)。熱循環 3000 次，長
時穩定 10k 小時。需要強冷卻(forced cooling)，一天三次，自然冷卻一天一次。 
 採用的材料有 8YSZ，Crofer 22 APU 或 Cr-ferrite steel，封裝玻璃 BaO-CaO-Al2O3- 
SiO2，(並未見低溫的氧化硼，頗為可疑?) Cathode 為 LSCF，電流集流(current 
collector)為 LSCF。 
ZeuSII 計畫在 2004 年單電池就達到 800oC 操作，0.7V 輸出，0.8A/cm2 紀錄；
2006 年 800oC 操作，0.7V 輸出，1.36 A/cm2 達到新紀錄，但電池組可以輸出 500 
mA/cm2，每操作 1000 小時少於 2%能量輸出損失。最近單電池採用氧化鈰介面
層(300-500 μm)，單電池在 800oC，0.7V 輸出，2.6 A/cm2 最佳紀錄。 
 
日本 AIST 的 Yokokawa 博士介紹該單位進行長時間監控由日本京都陶瓷製
作的 1 kW 固態燃料電池堆的分析結果，影響的雜質元素包括氯(Cl)、硫(S)、氧
化鉻氣體(CrO3 gas)。提出一例，Inconel 產生的鉻氣體與 LSM 反應，生成 SrCrO4，
劣化陰極導電性。此外，氧化鈰與氧化鋯以 50%混合，其電導特性明顯降低，與
金屬材料合金電導行為相似。若是兩種氧化物形成層狀複合，長時間處理，因
Kirkendall effect，在氧化鈰端形成孔洞。在陽極(anode)端，因鎳產生燒結，降低
接觸面積，降低比表面積導電性，此外，殘碳雖可增加導電性，但會阻塞流道，
對燃氣的傳送有負面影響。在還原氣氛中，含有水氣 0.5 atm，CO2 約 0.25 atm，
H2S 約 10-6atm，鎳金屬會與 H、O、C、S 反應，例如形成 NiS，會降低 cell votage 
output。其實驗設計含有 2-1000 ppm 硫化氫，超過 100 ppm，將會引起鎳之液相
燒結，喪失表面積。日本 1kW 定置型燃料電池目前測試已達 5,000 小時，還要
進行到 100,000 小時才會停止。 法國 CEA 的 K. Girona 報導少量 H2S 會增加 ASR
約 20%，也發現 Ni3S2 相。 
 
  Juelich 的 S. Uhlenbruck 博士使用 TEM 分析陰極材料 La0.58Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3-δ(
簡稱 LSFC)與氧化鋯之介面反應，在 1040oC 反應一段時間，會生成 SrZrO3 中間
層，大幅減少能量輸出。若在介面以網印或 1300oC 以 PVD 鍍上 0.5 μm 的 Gd-CeO2
薄層，在 800oC 的表現最佳。發現 Gd 少量擴散入 LSM 或 LSFC 中。陰極層在
ETH 採用脈衝雷射沉積法(pulse laser deposition)或是 spray-pyrolysis 法製作，其
中 La 含量予以改變，從 0.6 降到 0.55 時，power density 會減少，需要注意。前
者製程的薄膜因為含有水氣及其他揮發物質，經過 600Æ900oC 處理，會有 18%
孔隙生成，對於應用而言有好處。另一系統 Ba0.5(Sr0.5)Fe0.2Co0.8O3-δ簡稱ΒSCF，
或是 Ba0.5(La0.25Sr0.25)Fe0.2Co0.8O3-δ簡稱ΒLSCF，有較前 LSFC 高的 ASR(ohm/cm2)。
製作的微型燃料電池之功能為 150 mW/cm2 at 375 mA/cm2，550oC，0.6V output with 
1.06V OCV。
