and carbon nano fibers in the future. One of the 
characteristics of graphene is its ultrahigh specific 
surface area which would improve the nucleation rate 
during the foaming process. Thus, graphene was 
compounded with polystyrene and polymer-graphene 
nanocomposite foam was prepared using a batch foaming 
technique. Combining the advantages of polymer 
nanocomposite and foam may create a new class of 
lightweight, high strength materials which could have 
many new possibilities. 
In the first part of this study, natural graphite was 
oxidized by Hummers method and followed by thermal 
reduction to obtain graphene nanoplatelets. The 
graphene and graphite oxide nanoparticles were 
characterized by XRD, EDS and FTIR .In the second 
part of this study, graphene was compounded with 
polystyrene by solvent blending. The dispersion of 
grapheme was characterized by TEM. Finally, the 
polymer-graphene nanocomposites were foamed using 
supercritical carbon dioxide as the blowing agent 
using a batch foam process. The graphene/polystyrene 
nanocomposites were foamed at 120 ° C and various 
foaming pressure. The foam structure was 
characterized by SEM.  
The experiment results showed that adding 
nanoparticles can significantly enhance the 
nucleation rate and decrease the cell size. To 
compare the nucleation effect of different 
nanoparticles, thermally reduced graphene (TRG), 
carbon nanotubes, carbon nano fiber, commercially 
available nanographite platelets and talc were used 
as nucleating agents. Among the different 
nanoparticles, graphene showed the best nucleating 
efficiency. The cell size is 7.8 μm while the cell 
density is 3.54×109 cell/cm3 foamed at 120°and 2000 
psi. In addition, it is worth noting that adding 
nanoparticles as a nucleating agent can make foams of 
similar cell size and cell density with a much lower 
foaming pressure.

摘要： 
高分子發泡材料發展已有多年歷史，其特色包括節
省成本、絕熱隔音、減輕重量、提高抗衝擊性及抗疲
勞性等等。另外近年來石墨烯的研究大幅提升，無論
是電性、機械性質、導熱性質、比表面積，石墨烯都
有驚人的表現。因此我們結合發泡技術以及石墨烯材
料製備成複合發泡材來研究其發泡結構。 
本實驗第一階段先使用 Hummers method 把天然
石墨氧化成氧化石墨，再將氧化石墨經由高溫熱還原
成石墨烯。後續利用 XRD、EDS、FTIR 等儀器來分
析氧化石墨和熱還原石墨製備的成效。第二階段我們
使用溶劑混合法將石墨烯添加到聚苯乙烯中形成奈
米複合材料，並以 TEM 確認石墨烯在複合材料中的
分散性。最後使用超臨界二氧化碳作為發泡劑，對石
墨烯/聚苯乙烯奈米複合材料做批次發泡程序，以 120
℃作為發泡溫度，改變發泡壓力和添加不同成核劑來
做發泡結構之探討。 
實驗結果表示，添加奈米顆粒可以明顯提升成核
速率並且使泡孔縮小。分別以熱還原石墨烯、奈米碳
管、奈米碳纖維、xGnP層狀石墨與滑石粉作為成核劑
來比較發泡效果，而石墨烯的發泡效果最好，在發泡
溫度為 120℃，發泡壓力為 2000 psi下，泡孔直徑只
有 7.8μm；泡孔密度為 3.54×109cell/cm3。

1.簡介 
  自從 2004 年Andre Geim和Konstantin Novoselov兩
人成功的從石墨中分離出單層石墨烯並且證明其可以
單獨存在，之後石墨烯相關研究文獻層出不窮，成級數
成長，兩人也在 2010 年得到諾貝爾物理學獎。石墨烯
呈現 2-D平面結構，每一個碳原子以sp2混成軌域鍵結成
六角形蜂巢狀，且碳原子表面受到外力作用時會彎曲使
其不易斷裂。沒有缺陷的晶格可以讓電子方便傳遞以及
熱的傳遞。無論是石墨烯的介電性質：例如電子遷移率
(~200,000 cm2/V‧s)，電阻率(~1×10-6Ω·cm)；機械性質：
楊氏模數(~1,100 GPa)、斷裂強度(~125 GPa)；熱傳性質：
導熱係數(~5,300 W/m‧K)，熱穩定性(450~650℃)，還
有對於本實驗發泡程序有關係的超高比表面積(一般：
100~1,000 m2/g；理論：2600 m2/g)，這些都是值得做研
究開發的課題[1]。 
石墨烯複合材料近年來蓬勃發展，然而，將其用在
發泡複合材料方面的研究文獻，目前並不多見[2,3]。高
分子發泡材料發展已經有段時間，其相關學術研究以及
工業應用一直沒有中斷過，發泡材料除了降低成本、產
品輕量化、絕熱和隔音性佳、高強度/密度比，如果泡
孔結構為開孔泡，也可以作為過濾材。發泡所使用的發
泡劑可分為化學發泡劑以及物理發泡劑。化學發泡是利
用發泡劑遇到熱而發生化學變化，產生氣體來發泡，常
見的化學發泡劑例如：碳酸氫鈉、偶氮二異丁腈；物理
發泡是在一定壓力下將對高分子具有高溶解度且在常
壓下為氣體的化學物融入材料中，當含浸一定時間後瞬
間降壓使氣體快速從材料中釋放達到發泡效果，常見物
理發泡劑例如：二氧化碳、氮氣、水、碳氫化合物、氟
氯碳化物。 
氟氯碳化物在一般環境下非常安定，而且對高分子
有很好的溶解度，在過去數十年廣泛用於工業界作為發
泡劑，但是發現氟氯碳化物會破壞臭氧層後，1987 年在
蒙特婁簽署破壞臭氧層物質管制議定書後，氟氯碳化物
被限制使用以及製造[4]。另外氮氣對於高分子的溶解度
不佳導致不易發泡，而水可能使機器生鏽且對高分子的
溶解度也不高。碳氫化合物雖然對高分子的溶解度較高，
但有易燃、爆炸的危險，於是我們選用了對環境不會造
成汙染且對高分子溶解度較高、價格便宜的二氧化碳作
為發泡劑。在 1980 年，美國麻省理工學院(MIT)的機械
系教授Dr. Nam. P. Suh首次使用超臨界二氧化碳作為發
泡劑後，發展至今 30 年已有相當多研究文獻，二氧化
碳(臨界溫度：31.5℃，臨界壓力：7.3 MPa)在一般高分
子加工上容易達到超臨界態，超臨界流體的優點在於它
擁有液體般的溶解度、又有氣體般的擴散係數，更容易、
更快速地滲入高分子基材中，大幅增加發泡的成功率
[5]。 
發泡程序可分為四階段：(1)發泡成核階段(2)泡體成
長階段(3)泡體聚併及破裂階段(4)冷卻泡體固化高分子
階段。成核階段可分為同相成核以及異相成核，其最大
的差別在於異相成核有添加成核劑，成核劑效果取決於
與發泡劑的親和力，以及與發泡劑所接觸的界面比表面
積，親和力越好、比表面積越大，所產生的成核點就越
多，在相同的自由體積下，成核點越多所發出來的泡就
越小、越密集(在泡體沒有聚併、破裂情況)，所表現的
成核效果越好。對微發泡程序而言我們所希望的是泡孔
越小，泡孔密度越高，為了防止泡體聚併、破裂，需要
冷卻泡體階段來限制泡體成長來達到微米泡。 
 
2.實驗 
  本計畫中使用的材料包括：苯乙烯單體 (from 
SIGMA-ALDRICH) 、 偶 氮 二 異 丁 腈 (AIBN, from 
UniRegion Bio-Tech)、硝酸鈉、過錳酸鉀、硫酸、鹽酸
(from JT-Baker)、過氧化氫(from Riedel-de Haen)、四氫
呋 喃 (THF ；  tetrahydrofuran ) 、 乙 醇 、 甲 醇 (from 
Mallinckrodt)、SP-1 天然磷狀石墨(BAY CARBON, Inc., 
Michigan USA)、奈米碳管(carbon nanotube；CNT)由高
達光有限公司提供、奈米碳纖維(carbon nanofiber；CNF, 
購 自 Pyrograf® Products, Inc.Ohio, USA) ，
xGnP-H25(from XG Sciences)；、乙醚(購自景明化工股
份有限公司)。 
 
2-1.聚苯乙烯製備 
因為一般商用聚苯乙烯內含有一些添加物，例如脫
模劑硬酯酸鋅，這些添加劑可能影響後續實驗，所以本
實驗使用自行原位聚合聚苯乙烯。 
3 
 
CNT，直徑約 20 nm，可以看出其分散程度也是相當良
好。圖四(c)CNF 的外觀也是細長管狀物，但直徑約 100 
nm，也是呈現均勻分散。以上 TEM 照片顯示溶劑混合
法能夠將填料分散的不錯，有利於之後發泡實驗的研
究。 
表面電阻測試：電性方面，我們使用十一點探針來
測量其表面電阻，分別在不同位置的五個點作測量後取
平均值，再取各濃度的數據作圖，由圖五中可以看出數
值驟降的點稱為電滲流閥值 (electrical percolation 
threshold)[14]。比較其他文獻發現，在大部分高分子中
添加 TRG 所得到的電滲流閥值都非常低，大都< 0.5 vol 
%[15]，我們 TRG 也測得良好的的電滲流閥值約 0.5 vol 
%，表示其有良好電性及分散性，在未來也可能朝電性
方面研究。 
BET：比表面積對於成核階段有非常直接的關係，
比表面積越大所提供成核的空間越多，而越多的成核點
可使泡孔密度上升，有利於我們發泡效果，於是使用比
表面積量測分析儀 BET 來對熱還原石墨烯作量測。BET
方程式是在 1938 年由 Brunauer、Emmett、Teller 三位科
學家所提出，此方程式是延續 Langmuir 的單層吸附模
式發展成多層吸附現象[16]。 
我們把各樣品拿去測比表面積，(型號：
Micromeritics ASAP 2020)，測出來的結果為，Talc：3~5 
m2/g、CNF：55.38±1.02 m2/g、H-25：29.66±0.24 m2/g、
CNT：166.44±1.26 m2/g、 TRG：402.02±1.03 m2/g。以
上結果表示TRG所展現出來的比表面積最大，可提供成
核面積最大發泡效果最好，這與我們SEM所分析的結果
相符。 
 
3-2.發泡結果 
  發泡程序的參數設定方面，溫度為 120℃，壓力為
1100、1200、1300、1500、1700、2000 psi (7.59 MPa~13.8 
MPa)。本實驗使用 120℃作為固定條件是因為在高分子
加工過程中，大部分所使用的不是批次發泡而是連續式
擠出發泡，在擠出發泡過程中模頭溫度若低於 120℃，
PS 離開高壓下之後的高黏度會將模頭堵住造成生產中
斷。未來本實驗室希望發展連續式押出發泡，所以我們
使用 120℃作為發泡溫度。 
  我們比較了幾種不同的成核劑，有市面上常用的滑
石粉，以及常與石墨烯做比較的奈米碳管、奈米碳纖維、
xGnP-H25。從熱力學異相成核 Gibbs 自由能方面來探討

由 (4)式可以看出異相成核速率效果取決於異相
Gibbs 自由能，自由能若越小，成核階段產生微小泡體
所需要克服的能量就越小。自由能(5)式中 f(m,w)是由成
核劑所影響，(6)式中可以看出當接觸角越小或表面曲率
半徑越大時，能大幅降低自由能幫助成核效應[17]。而
我們石墨烯的曲率半徑趨近於無限大，且具有高比表面
積提供大量成核點能夠大幅提升發泡效果，陸續我們探
討其泡孔大小和泡孔密度，並且比較其他添加劑，發現
TRG 的效果較佳。 
我們由實驗結果圖六和圖七中可以看出，在 2000 
psi下，無論是純聚苯乙烯或是添加成核劑所發泡得到的
泡孔大小、泡孔密度皆很相近。所以同相成核及異相成
核的成核效果差別不大。各種成核劑在 2000 psi下發出
來的泡孔大小都大約 7~8μm左右，泡孔密度大約在
2.23×109~4.56×109cell/cm3。因此在高壓下(5)式中主要影
響為壓降項而不是f(m,w)。反觀圖八在 1100 psi的低壓下
則明顯可以看到成核劑的效果明顯表現出來，聚苯乙烯
的泡孔大小增加到 83.93 μm，而TRG的泡孔大小卻只有
18.71 μm。另外TRG的泡孔密度還有 2.03×108cells/cm3，
而聚苯乙烯驟降至 4.25×106cells/cm3，相差了有 100 倍
左右。由以上實驗結果表示，在低壓下成核劑的效果較
為顯著，綜觀所比較的成核劑中，無論是泡孔大小和泡
孔密度以TRG作為成核劑的發泡效果最佳。在Colton文
獻中，他們添加一般PS加工過程中常使用的脫膜劑硬酯
酸鋅作為成核劑，同時使用模擬和實驗數據來做成核劑
濃度與成核速率的關係圖，發現在低濃度時成核速率比
1%的高[18]，由BET的量測結果可知，TRG的比表面積
遠比本實驗中所使用之其他奈米顆粒為高，我們也嘗試
了用 0.1%的TRG來發泡，發現效果遠較 1%的TRG為佳，
在 1100psi下發泡出來的泡孔TRG減少到 10.92μm，泡孔
密度更提升了五倍有餘，增高為 1.17×109 cells/cm3。  
4.結論 
我們將天然鱗狀石墨經由 Hummers method 成功的
製備出氧化石墨，再使用熱還原法製備出 TRG。後續也
利用 TEM、XRD、FTIR、EDS 等分析儀器證明 TRG 成
功製備。而電性方面，PS-TRG 複合材料測得表面電阻
的 percolation threshold 僅為 0.4vol%，未來也可朝電性
方面發展。 
在發泡實驗中，發泡壓力 2000 psi、發泡溫度 120
℃下，不同添加劑發泡材料的泡孔直徑和泡孔密度差別
不大。純聚苯乙烯的泡孔直徑也只有 8.06 μm，與其他
添加成核劑的材料發泡效果一樣，因為在高壓下成核速
率受壓降影響較大，使成核劑的效果降低。發泡壓力越
往低壓，泡孔大小越有明顯的不同。當發泡壓力在 1100 
psi時純聚苯乙烯的泡孔高達 83.93 μm，泡孔密度只有
4.25×106cell/cm3，而有添加劑的泡孔都在 24.41 μm以下，
其中以熱還原石墨烯(TRG)所形成的的泡孔最小，且在
僅有 0.1wt%的TRG作為成核劑之下，泡孔大小降低到僅

Abstract 
In this study, polystyrene / nano-graphite nanocomposite 
foams were made by melt compounding and in-situ 
polymerization. The foam was made by batch foaming using 
CO2 as the blowing agent. Various foaming pressures and 
temperatures were studied. The results indicated that the cell 
morphology was improved with the advanced dispersion of 
the nanoparticles. The in-situ polymerization method provided 
better dispersion and the resulting nanocomposite foam had 
finer cell size than that made by melt compounding. Adding 
nanoparticles as a nucleating agent can make foams of similar 
cell size and cell density at a lower foaming pressure and it 
can be explained by the classical nucleation theory. This 
discovery could open up a new route to produce microcellular 
foams at a low foaming pressure.

Introduction 
Polymer composites are known as lightweight, high 
strength-materials. These characteristics make them more 
attractive with the increase in energy prices. With the 
development of nanotechnology, the research of polymer 
composites has been brought into a new era of polymer 
nanocomposites. In many cases, nanocomposites are lighter, 
stiffer, tougher, and more stable as compared to conventional 
composites. For example, adding a very small amount of 
layered silicates (nanoclay) to nylon leads to pronounced 
improvements in its mechanical properties, increased heat 
distortion temperature, decreased gas permeability, and 
reduced flammability [1]. According to the geometry of the 
nanoparticles, they can be classified as one dimension (1D), 
2D and 3D nano fillers.   Typical examples of the 1D, 2D 
and 3D nano fillers are carbon nanofibers (CNFs), nanoclay 
and quantum dots [2]. In addition to nanoclay and CNFs, 
researchers also used nanofillers, such as carbon nanotubes 
(CNTs), to make polymer nanocomposites. However, the high 
manufacturing costs of CNFs and CNTs has limited them from 
most commercial applications. As a solution, graphite has 
become a good choice since it possesses a platelet-like 
structure and the price of graphite is much more affordable 
than the CNFs or CNTs.  
Graphite is composed of thousands of layers of 
nanosheets, called graphene. The exfoliation of graphite has 
been studied since the 1910’s[3, 4]. The layered structure 
provides a good opportunity to produce polymer 
nanocomposites. Pan et al. first fabricated conductive nylon 
6/graphite nanocomposites and thus influenced many of the 
subsequent studies [5]. Since the percolation threshold of 
polymer-graphite nanocomposites is much lower than 
polymers filled with carbon black, most of the research of 
polymer-graphite nanocomposites has focused on the 
electrical conductivity. For example, Drzal et al. invented 
several methods of making nanographites. Instead of using a 
furnace, graphite intercalated compounds are expanded using 
a microwave oven [6]. The nanographite powder and polymer 
were then dispersed in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and exfoliated 
by ultrasonication. The final product was compounded using a 
micro compounder. The resulting nanocomposites 
demonstrated a low percolation threshold with improved 
mechanical properties [7]. The nanoparticles from their 
research are not a single graphene layer, but a stack of ten to 
fifteen layers of graphene.  
One of the drawbacks of polymer composites is that the 
density of the composites increases with the addition of fillers. 
This problem can be overcome by foaming. Because of this, 
the foaming of polymer composites has become an emerging 
research area. Polymeric foams have versatile applications 
depending on their density and cell morphology. The foaming 
of polymers reduces the material cost and provides good 
insulation. The higher stiffness to density ratio as compared to 
solids provides more design flexibility.  
A foam that possesses an average cell size of less than 
10 μm and cell density higher than 109 cells / cm3 is defined as 
a microcellular foam. It has many special physical properties, 
such as a high modulus density ratio, high strength density 
ratio and high toughness, as compared to the non-foamed 
solids. In many cases, CO2 is used as the blowing agent to 
produce the microcellular foam because of its high diffusivity 
and moderate solubility in most polymers. Nevertheless, a 
high pressure drop rate and fast cooling are the critical 
requirements to produce microcellular foam, thus expensive, 
specially designed equipment is needed [8]. Adding 
nanoparticles may provide solutions without using such 
equipment because the high surface area of the nanoparticles 
offers many more nucleation sites than conventional 
nucleation agents.  
In a foaming process, cells are generated by the 
following steps: (1) cell nucleation (2) cell growth and (3) cell 
coalescence [9, 10]. By properly controlling the foaming 
conditions, the cell size, cell density, and foam density can be 
manipulated. In the past, researchers have worked on the 
microcellular foaming of nanoclay, CNF and CNT polymer 
nanocomposites[11, 12]. The results indicated that 
nanoparticles showed much higher nucleation efficiency than 
4(a). On the other hand, as can be seen in Figure 4(b) that 
graphene layers intercalated with polystyrene and single 
graphene layers could be found. These microscopic pictures 
provide evidence that in-situ polymerization produces better 
dispersion than melt compounded samples. 
The cell morphology of the neat PS and their composite 
foamed at 70˚C and 13.79 MPa (2000 psi) is shown in Figures 
5 (a) – (d). The microscopic pictures of the foamed PG-22 and 
in-situ polymerized PS are shown in Figures 5(a) and 5(b), 
while the foaming results of sample made by the melt 
compounding and in-situ polymerization are shown in Figure 
5(c) and 5(d). Compared to their counterparts, Figures 5(c) 
and 6(d), the neat polymers possess a large cell size and low 
cell density which implies adding nanoparticles would affect 
the cell morphology. Additionally, it can be seen from Figures 
5(a) and 5(b) that the cell size of the foamed PG-22 sample is 
apparently larger than that of the in-situ polymerized PS. The 
results are not surprising since researchers have reported that 
there are unknown additives in the commercial PS and it 
would also act as a blowing agent which may interfere with 
the foaming process [19].  
The SEM pictures of foamed PG22/graphite 
nanocomposites indicate that the cells were destroyed by the 
graphite platelets. The average cell size is 4.33 µm and the cell 
density is 1.07*1010 cells/cm3. One reason could be that the 
diameter of the graphite is about 25 μm which is larger than 
the average cell size foamed under this condition. The 
morphology of the foamed in-situ polymerization sample 
showed an improved cell morphology. The cell size decreased 
to 1.66μm and the cell density increased to 1.11*1011 cells/cm3. 
It has to be noted that although the diameter of the graphite 
platelets is much larger than the cell size, in this case, they did 
not break the cell. Instead, the cell grew on the surface of the 
nanographite. This could be evidence that the well-dispersed 
nanographite acted as the nucleation agent. Therefore, we can 
conclude that a well-dispersed graphite may result in an 
excellent cell structure.  
Hence unknown additives exist in most of the 
commercial PS products, and since the molecular weight 
distribution does not affect the final cell structure of the foam, 
in the following section, only the polymer nanocomposite 
foam made by in-situ polymerization will be discussed.  
The average cell size and cell density of in-situ 
polymerized PS, and its nanocomposites foamed at 13.79 MPa 
and different temperatures are shown in Figures 6. The results 
indicated that we would be able to meet the requirements of a 
microcellular foam in all of our experiments and adding 
nanoparticles would result in low cell size and high cell 
density. A two-way analysis of variance analysis (ANOVA) 
was conducted using Microsoft Excel with a confidence 
interval of 95%. The ANOVA results indicated that both the 
foaming temperature and nanoparticles would affect the cell 
size. However, the impact of the nanoparticles on the cell size 
was not as significant as expected. Colton and Suh analyzed 
the effect of the foaming pressure and temperature on the PS 
foam by batch foaming techniques [20]. According to the

where, Nhom is the homogeneous nucleation rate, and f0 is the 
frequency factor for gas molecules joining to a critical nuclei 
and convert it into stable nuclei. C0 is the concentration of the 
gas molecules. k is the Boltzmann constant. γbp is the 
interfacial energy between a gas bubble and polymer, and ΔP 
is the gas saturation pressure. Similarly, the rate of 
heterogeneous nucleation can be expressed by equations 4 and

where f1 is the frequency factor for the heterogeneous

energy due to the addition of a heterogeneous inclusion. It is a 
function of the contact angle between the gas bubbles and 
nucleants and the geometry of the nucleant. Details of the 
reduction function f can be found elsewhere [11]. The value of 
f for carbon materials can be as low as 0.006.It implies that 
using platelet-like nucleants, such as nanographite, would 
improve the nucleation efficiency.  
Despite using a potentially highly efficient nucleating 
agent, the cell density did not increase as was expected. As 
can be seen in equation 3, the nucleation energy is inversely 
proportional to the square of the gas saturation pressure. 
hom
*G  is highly dependent on the saturation pressure which 
it would be the main factor that controls the homogeneous 
nucleation rate. Colton and Suh studied the PS/zinc stearate 
system and calculated the nucleation rate at 110˚C. Their 
calculation showed that when the pressure is higher than 10.13 
MPa (100 atm), the homogenous nucleation rate would be 
much higher than that of the heterogeneous nucleation. When 
nucleation agents were added, heterogeneous nucleation 
became dominant and the nucleation rate was governed by the 
concentration of the nucleating sites, C1. Because high 
concentration of the nucleation agent would form aggregates 
and decrease the number of nucleating sites, the cell density 
did not significantly increase with the loading level of the 
nucleation agent [21].  
With the development of nanotechnology, the interfacial 
area between a polymer and nanoparticles would be 
significantly increased. The concentration of the nucleation 
sites could be increased by orders of magnitude and 
microcellular foam could be obtained at a low foaming 
pressure. Therefore, similar experiments were conducted at the 
foaming pressure of 10.34 MPa and the results are shown in 
Figure 7. 
The nucleation efficiency of nanoparticles is very 
significant at low pressure. For example, the cell size of neat 
PS increased from 9.34 µm to 19.84 µm when the foaming 
pressure reduced to 10.34MPa at 120˚C. Also, the cell density 
decreased from 2.31*109 cells/cm3 to 1.58*108 cells/cm3. In 
contrast, the cell size increased from 8.84 µm to 11.81 µm 
while the cell density decreased from 2.21*109 cells/cm3 to 
9.62*108 cells/cm3 in the presence of 1wt% nanographite. The 
obvious differences in cell size and cell density strongly 
supported the assumption that the effect of the nanoparticles is 
pronounced at low pressure.  
In order to investigate the effect of the saturation pressure 
on the cell structure, a series foaming experiments were 
conducted. The foaming temperature was fixed at 90˚C and

remains an extremely challenging topic. The above issues, 
such as high processing temperature and high diffusivity 
of blowing agents make it extremely difficult to produce 
fiber foam via extrusion. In this study, we began with the 
batch foaming process. Both non-woven fibers and bulk 
polymers were foamed to investigate the possibility of 
producing microcellular fibers.  
Since the diameter of melt spun fibers is less than 
50µm, the cell size should be less than 10µm. Using a 
nucleation agent could be helpful in achieving such a low 
cell size [13]. Nano-sized filler is highly preferred in this 
condition since the size of micro-fillers is comparable to 
the diameter of fibers and could create a severe defect to 
the fibers. In addition, well dispersed nanoparticles would 
improve the strength of polymer and compensate the loss 
of strength due to foaming. Because of this, nanoclay was 
used as the nucleation agent. 
Experiments 
PET pellets, SP1912, were provided by 
Chung-Hsing Textile Ltd. Amorphous PET sheets were 
provided by Nanya Plastics Corp. TPU pellets, Kuotane 
320, were provided by Kuo Ching Chemical Co Ltd. 
TPEE pellets were provided by Changchun Group. 
Polypropylene pellets, grade HP563S, were supplied by 
LCY Chemical Corp. Nanoclay, Cloisite 30B, was 
purchased from Southern Clay Product Inc.  
All polymers or nonwoven fabrics were pre-dried in 
a vacuum oven at 80˚C for 12 hours to remove any 
moisture. Polymers were then immersed in CO2 in a 
tubular pressure vessel. The pressure was fixed at 13.6 
MPa for a certain amount of time while the temperature 
was varied from 40~150˚C. There are two different 
foaming processes. In the one-step foaming process, 
samples were foamed right after the pressure release.  In 
the two-step foaming process, samples were saturated at 
13.6 MPa at 40˚C for a certain amount of time and 
removed from the pressure vessel. The samples were then 
immersed in a hot bath for 5 to 20 seconds for foaming 
and put in an ice bath to fix the cell structure. To 
determine the solubility of CO2 in different polymers, 
samples were immersed in CO2 at 40C for 6 hours. After 
the pressure release, samples were carefully weighed 
using a microbalance to estimate the solubility of CO2 in 
the polymers. The density of the foam was determined by 
the Archimedes’ principle.  
 Nanoclay and polymer were pre-dried and 
compounded using a Thermo Haake conical twin screw 
micro-compounder. The screw speed and temperature 
were fixed at 80rpm and 190˚C, respectively.  
The morphology of the fibers was characterized 
using a Hitachi S-3000H scanning electronic microscope. 
Samples were immersed in liquid nitrogen for 3 minutes 
and cryo-fractured for observation. The nanographite 
dispersion was characterized by x-ray diffraction 
(PANalytical X’pert Pro) and transmission electron 
microscopy (Hitachi H-7100). The average cell size was 
estimated by selecting more than 100 cells in an SEM 
picture using Image J software. The cell density was 
estimated using the following equation: 
௙ܰ ൌ ሺ௡஺ሻଷ/ଶ                   (1) 
Results and Discussion 
 The estimated CO2 solubility of different polymers 
is shown in Figure 1. It is found that TPU possesses the 
highest solubility among the different polymers while 
PET has the lowest. High CO2 solubility could result in a 
high nucleation rate [14]. The result of the solubility test 
indicates that TPU is a good candidate for foaming.  
The samples foamed by two step foaming with a 
foaming temperature of 150˚C are shown in Figure 2. The 
foaming time was 20 seconds. PET and PP could not be 
foamed under this operation temperature. This is because 
PET and PP are semi-crystallized polymers and the 
foaming temperature is below the melting point of both 
polymers. On the contrary, amorphous PET can be 
foamed by batch foaming although the cell size is much 
smaller than the other samples. This is consistent with 
reference [7]. The cell density of TPU and TPEE foam is 
significantly higher than other polymers. The average cell 
size of TPEE foam is lower than that of TPU; however, it 
expressed an apparent bimodal structure which is 
undesirable for fiber foam applications. In summary, the 
results are congruent with the solubility measurement, i.e. 
the high solubility of CO2 would create high cell density. 
We have to note that TPU and TPEE are block 
copolymers that are composed of soft segments and hard 
segments. They can be foamed even though the foaming 
temperature is lower than the processing temperature. 
However, hard and soft segments in the polymer would 
make the foaming mechanism very complex. There are 
only two pieces of literatures that discuss the foaming of 
TPU using CO2 [15, 16] and no reference of foaming 
TPEE could be found. Based on the previous screening 
foaming test, the foaming of TPU has become our goal.  
Nonwoven TPU was foamed by the two-step 
foaming process and the results are shown in figure 3. 
Nonwoven are not foamed at all and the weight of TPU 
was not increased after being immersed in CO2 for 6 
hours. Due to the fine fiber diameter, most of the CO2 
diffused out of the nonwoven and did not act as a blowing 
agent.  
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of 
TPU/nanoclay nanocomposite is shown in Figure 4. The 
XRD pattern indicated that the characteristic peak of 
1wt% TPU nanocomposites disappeared which implied an 
exfoliated structure. When the loading level of nanoclay 
increased to 3wt% and 5wt%, the characteristic peak did 
not disappear but shifted from 1.82nm to 3.77nm and 3.42

Abstract 
In this study, polystyrene / nano-graphite nanocomposite 
foams were made by melt compounding and in-situ 
polymerization. The foam was made by batch foaming using 
CO2 as the blowing agent. Various foaming pressures and 
temperatures were studied. The results indicated that the cell 
morphology was improved with the advanced dispersion of 
the nanoparticles. The in-situ polymerization method provided 
better dispersion and the resulting nanocomposite foam had 
finer cell size than that made by melt compounding. Adding 
nanoparticles as a nucleating agent can make foams of similar 
cell size and cell density at a lower foaming pressure and it 
can be explained by the classical nucleation theory. This 
discovery could open up a new route to produce microcellular 
foams at a low foaming pressure.

Introduction 
Polymer composites are known as lightweight, high 
strength-materials. These characteristics make them more 
attractive with the increase in energy prices. With the 
development of nanotechnology, the research of polymer 
composites has been brought into a new era of polymer 
nanocomposites. In many cases, nanocomposites are lighter, 
stiffer, tougher, and more stable as compared to conventional 
composites. For example, adding a very small amount of 
layered silicates (nanoclay) to nylon leads to pronounced 
improvements in its mechanical properties, increased heat 
distortion temperature, decreased gas permeability, and 
reduced flammability [1]. According to the geometry of the 
nanoparticles, they can be classified as one dimension (1D), 
2D and 3D nano fillers.   Typical examples of the 1D, 2D 
and 3D nano fillers are carbon nanofibers (CNFs), nanoclay 
and quantum dots [2]. In addition to nanoclay and CNFs, 
researchers also used nanofillers, such as carbon nanotubes 
(CNTs), to make polymer nanocomposites. However, the high 
manufacturing costs of CNFs and CNTs has limited them from 
most commercial applications. As a solution, graphite has 
become a good choice since it possesses a platelet-like 
structure and the price of graphite is much more affordable 
than the CNFs or CNTs.  
Graphite is composed of thousands of layers of 
nanosheets, called graphene. The exfoliation of graphite has 
been studied since the 1910’s[3, 4]. The layered structure 
provides a good opportunity to produce polymer 
nanocomposites. Pan et al. first fabricated conductive nylon 
6/graphite nanocomposites and thus influenced many of the 
subsequent studies [5]. Since the percolation threshold of 
polymer-graphite nanocomposites is much lower than 
polymers filled with carbon black, most of the research of 
polymer-graphite nanocomposites has focused on the 
electrical conductivity. For example, Drzal et al. invented 
several methods of making nanographites. Instead of using a 
furnace, graphite intercalated compounds are expanded using 
a microwave oven [6]. The nanographite powder and polymer 
were then dispersed in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and exfoliated 
by ultrasonication. The final product was compounded using a 
micro compounder. The resulting nanocomposites 
demonstrated a low percolation threshold with improved 
mechanical properties [7]. The nanoparticles from their 
research are not a single graphene layer, but a stack of ten to 
fifteen layers of graphene.  
One of the drawbacks of polymer composites is that the 
density of the composites increases with the addition of fillers. 
This problem can be overcome by foaming. Because of this, 
the foaming of polymer composites has become an emerging 
research area. Polymeric foams have versatile applications 
depending on their density and cell morphology. The foaming 
of polymers reduces the material cost and provides good 
insulation. The higher stiffness to density ratio as compared to 
solids provides more design flexibility.  
A foam that possesses an average cell size of less than 
10 μm and cell density higher than 109 cells / cm3 is defined as 
a microcellular foam. It has many special physical properties, 
such as a high modulus density ratio, high strength density 
ratio and high toughness, as compared to the non-foamed 
solids. In many cases, CO2 is used as the blowing agent to 
produce the microcellular foam because of its high diffusivity 
and moderate solubility in most polymers. Nevertheless, a 
high pressure drop rate and fast cooling are the critical 
requirements to produce microcellular foam, thus expensive, 
specially designed equipment is needed [8]. Adding 
nanoparticles may provide solutions without using such 
equipment because the high surface area of the nanoparticles 
offers many more nucleation sites than conventional 
nucleation agents.  
In a foaming process, cells are generated by the 
following steps: (1) cell nucleation (2) cell growth and (3) cell 
coalescence [9, 10]. By properly controlling the foaming 
conditions, the cell size, cell density, and foam density can be 
manipulated. In the past, researchers have worked on the 
microcellular foaming of nanoclay, CNF and CNT polymer 
nanocomposites[11, 12]. The results indicated that 
nanoparticles showed much higher nucleation efficiency than 
4(a). On the other hand, as can be seen in Figure 4(b) that 
graphene layers intercalated with polystyrene and single 
graphene layers could be found. These microscopic pictures 
provide evidence that in-situ polymerization produces better 
dispersion than melt compounded samples. 
The cell morphology of the neat PS and their composite 
foamed at 70˚C and 13.79 MPa (2000 psi) is shown in Figures 
5 (a) – (d). The microscopic pictures of the foamed PG-22 and 
in-situ polymerized PS are shown in Figures 5(a) and 5(b), 
while the foaming results of sample made by the melt 
compounding and in-situ polymerization are shown in Figure 
5(c) and 5(d). Compared to their counterparts, Figures 5(c) 
and 6(d), the neat polymers possess a large cell size and low 
cell density which implies adding nanoparticles would affect 
the cell morphology. Additionally, it can be seen from Figures 
5(a) and 5(b) that the cell size of the foamed PG-22 sample is 
apparently larger than that of the in-situ polymerized PS. The 
results are not surprising since researchers have reported that 
there are unknown additives in the commercial PS and it 
would also act as a blowing agent which may interfere with 
the foaming process [19].  
The SEM pictures of foamed PG22/graphite 
nanocomposites indicate that the cells were destroyed by the 
graphite platelets. The average cell size is 4.33 µm and the cell 
density is 1.07*1010 cells/cm3. One reason could be that the 
diameter of the graphite is about 25 μm which is larger than 
the average cell size foamed under this condition. The 
morphology of the foamed in-situ polymerization sample 
showed an improved cell morphology. The cell size decreased 
to 1.66μm and the cell density increased to 1.11*1011 cells/cm3. 
It has to be noted that although the diameter of the graphite 
platelets is much larger than the cell size, in this case, they did 
not break the cell. Instead, the cell grew on the surface of the 
nanographite. This could be evidence that the well-dispersed 
nanographite acted as the nucleation agent. Therefore, we can 
conclude that a well-dispersed graphite may result in an 
excellent cell structure.  
Hence unknown additives exist in most of the 
commercial PS products, and since the molecular weight 
distribution does not affect the final cell structure of the foam, 
in the following section, only the polymer nanocomposite 
foam made by in-situ polymerization will be discussed.  
The average cell size and cell density of in-situ 
polymerized PS, and its nanocomposites foamed at 13.79 MPa 
and different temperatures are shown in Figures 6. The results 
indicated that we would be able to meet the requirements of a 
microcellular foam in all of our experiments and adding 
nanoparticles would result in low cell size and high cell 
density. A two-way analysis of variance analysis (ANOVA) 
was conducted using Microsoft Excel with a confidence 
interval of 95%. The ANOVA results indicated that both the 
foaming temperature and nanoparticles would affect the cell 
size. However, the impact of the nanoparticles on the cell size 
was not as significant as expected. Colton and Suh analyzed 
the effect of the foaming pressure and temperature on the PS 
foam by batch foaming techniques [20]. According to the 
classical nucleation theory, the homogeneous nucleation rate 
could be described by equations 2 and 3[20].

where, Nhom is the homogeneous nucleation rate, and f0 is the 
frequency factor for gas molecules joining to a critical nuclei 
and convert it into stable nuclei. C0 is the concentration of the 
gas molecules. k is the Boltzmann constant. γbp is the 
interfacial energy between a gas bubble and polymer, and ΔP 
is the gas saturation pressure. Similarly, the rate of 
heterogeneous nucleation can be expressed by equations 4 and 
5[11, 15, 20].

where f1 is the frequency factor for the heterogeneous

energy due to the addition of a heterogeneous inclusion. It is a 
function of the contact angle between the gas bubbles and 
nucleants and the geometry of the nucleant. Details of the 
reduction function f can be found elsewhere [11]. The value of 
f for carbon materials can be as low as 0.006.It implies that 
using platelet-like nucleants, such as nanographite, would 
improve the nucleation efficiency.  
Despite using a potentially highly efficient nucleating 
agent, the cell density did not increase as was expected. As 
can be seen in equation 3, the nucleation energy is inversely 
proportional to the square of the gas saturation pressure. 
hom
*G  is highly dependent on the saturation pressure which 
it would be the main factor that controls the homogeneous 
nucleation rate. Colton and Suh studied the PS/zinc stearate 
system and calculated the nucleation rate at 110˚C. Their 
calculation showed that when the pressure is higher than 10.13 
MPa (100 atm), the homogenous nucleation rate would be 
much higher than that of the heterogeneous nucleation. When 
nucleation agents were added, heterogeneous nucleation 
became dominant and the nucleation rate was governed by the 
concentration of the nucleating sites, C1. Because high 
concentration of the nucleation agent would form aggregates 
and decrease the number of nucleating sites, the cell density 
did not significantly increase with the loading level of the 
nucleation agent [21].  
With the development of nanotechnology, the interfacial 
area between a polymer and nanoparticles would be 
significantly increased. The concentration of the nucleation 
sites could be increased by orders of magnitude and 
microcellular foam could be obtained at a low foaming 
pressure. Therefore, similar experiments were conducted at the 
foaming pressure of 10.34 MPa and the results are shown in 
Figure 7. 
The nucleation efficiency of nanoparticles is very 
significant at low pressure. For example, the cell size of neat 
PS increased from 9.34 µm to 19.84 µm when the foaming 
pressure reduced to 10.34MPa at 120˚C. Also, the cell density 
decreased from 2.31*109 cells/cm3 to 1.58*108 cells/cm3. In 
contrast, the cell size increased from 8.84 µm to 11.81 µm 
while the cell density decreased from 2.21*109 cells/cm3 to 
9.62*108 cells/cm3 in the presence of 1wt% nanographite. The 
obvious differences in cell size and cell density strongly 
supported the assumption that the effect of the nanoparticles is 
pronounced at low pressure.  
In order to investigate the effect of the saturation pressure 
on the cell structure, a series foaming experiments were 
conducted. The foaming temperature was fixed at 90˚C and

Nanocomposite
remains an extremely challenging topic. The above issues, 
such as high processing temperature and high diffusivity 
of blowing agents make it extremely difficult to produce 
fiber foam via extrusion. In this study, we began with the 
batch foaming process. Both non-woven fibers and bulk 
polymers were foamed to investigate the possibility of 
producing microcellular fibers.  
Since the diameter of melt spun fibers is less than 
50µm, the cell size should be less than 10µm. Using a 
nucleation agent could be helpful in achieving such a low 
cell size [13]. Nano-sized filler is highly preferred in this 
condition since the size of micro-fillers is comparable to 
the diameter of fibers and could create a severe defect to 
the fibers. In addition, well dispersed nanoparticles would 
improve the strength of polymer and compensate the loss 
of strength due to foaming. Because of this, nanoclay was 
used as the nucleation agent. 
Experiments 
PET pellets, SP1912, were provided by 
Chung-Hsing Textile Ltd. Amorphous PET sheets were 
provided by Nanya Plastics Corp. TPU pellets, Kuotane 
320, were provided by Kuo Ching Chemical Co Ltd. 
TPEE pellets were provided by Changchun Group. 
Polypropylene pellets, grade HP563S, were supplied by 
LCY Chemical Corp. Nanoclay, Cloisite 30B, was 
purchased from Southern Clay Product Inc.  
All polymers or nonwoven fabrics were pre-dried in 
a vacuum oven at 80˚C for 12 hours to remove any 
moisture. Polymers were then immersed in CO2 in a 
tubular pressure vessel. The pressure was fixed at 13.6 
MPa for a certain amount of time while the temperature 
was varied from 40~150˚C. There are two different 
foaming processes. In the one-step foaming process, 
samples were foamed right after the pressure release.  In 
the two-step foaming process, samples were saturated at 
13.6 MPa at 40˚C for a certain amount of time and 
removed from the pressure vessel. The samples were then 
immersed in a hot bath for 5 to 20 seconds for foaming 
and put in an ice bath to fix the cell structure. To 
determine the solubility of CO2 in different polymers, 
samples were immersed in CO2 at 40C for 6 hours. After 
the pressure release, samples were carefully weighed 
using a microbalance to estimate the solubility of CO2 in 
the polymers. The density of the foam was determined by 
the Archimedes’ principle.  
 Nanoclay and polymer were pre-dried and 
compounded using a Thermo Haake conical twin screw 
micro-compounder. The screw speed and temperature 
were fixed at 80rpm and 190˚C, respectively.  
The morphology of the fibers was characterized 
using a Hitachi S-3000H scanning electronic microscope. 
Samples were immersed in liquid nitrogen for 3 minutes 
and cryo-fractured for observation. The nanographite 
dispersion was characterized by x-ray diffraction 
(PANalytical X’pert Pro) and transmission electron 
microscopy (Hitachi H-7100). The average cell size was 
estimated by selecting more than 100 cells in an SEM 
picture using Image J software. The cell density was 
estimated using the following equation:

Results and Discussion 
 The estimated CO2 solubility of different polymers 
is shown in Figure 1. It is found that TPU possesses the 
highest solubility among the different polymers while 
PET has the lowest. High CO2 solubility could result in a 
high nucleation rate [14]. The result of the solubility test 
indicates that TPU is a good candidate for foaming.  
The samples foamed by two step foaming with a 
foaming temperature of 150˚C are shown in Figure 2. The 
foaming time was 20 seconds. PET and PP could not be 
foamed under this operation temperature. This is because 
PET and PP are semi-crystallized polymers and the 
foaming temperature is below the melting point of both 
polymers. On the contrary, amorphous PET can be 
foamed by batch foaming although the cell size is much 
smaller than the other samples. This is consistent with 
reference [7]. The cell density of TPU and TPEE foam is 
significantly higher than other polymers. The average cell 
size of TPEE foam is lower than that of TPU; however, it 
expressed an apparent bimodal structure which is 
undesirable for fiber foam applications. In summary, the 
results are congruent with the solubility measurement, i.e. 
the high solubility of CO2 would create high cell density. 
We have to note that TPU and TPEE are block 
copolymers that are composed of soft segments and hard 
segments. They can be foamed even though the foaming 
temperature is lower than the processing temperature. 
However, hard and soft segments in the polymer would 
make the foaming mechanism very complex. There are 
only two pieces of literatures that discuss the foaming of 
TPU using CO2 [15, 16] and no reference of foaming 
TPEE could be found. Based on the previous screening 
foaming test, the foaming of TPU has become our goal.  
Nonwoven TPU was foamed by the two-step 
foaming process and the results are shown in figure 3. 
Nonwoven are not foamed at all and the weight of TPU 
was not increased after being immersed in CO2 for 6 
hours. Due to the fine fiber diameter, most of the CO2 
diffused out of the nonwoven and did not act as a blowing 
agent.  
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of 
TPU/nanoclay nanocomposite is shown in Figure 4. The 
XRD pattern indicated that the characteristic peak of 
1wt% TPU nanocomposites disappeared which implied an 
exfoliated structure. When the loading level of nanoclay 
increased to 3wt% and 5wt%, the characteristic peak did 
not disappear but shifted from 1.82nm to 3.77nm and 3.42
