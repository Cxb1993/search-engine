1. Introduction 
Fuel cells are electro-chemical devices which realize the direct conversion of chemical energy 
of reactants to electric energy. With high efficiency and high environment compatibility enable that 
the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) to be a potential candidate of the power source 
in the near future. There have appeared a number of studies on transport phenomena and the cell 
performance of the PEM fuel cells in the open literature. Springer et al. [1] proposed an isothermal, 
one-dimensional model for the proton exchange membrane fuel cells.  In their model, water 
diffusion coefficient, electro-osmotic drag coefficient, water sorption isotherms and the membrane 
conductivities were assumed to be functions of membrane water content. It is found that the 
membrane resistance increases with the operating current density. And the net water flux ratio 
under typical condition is much less than that under the fully hydrated membrane. It is also found 
that if the membrane is thin enough, the resistance will then be reduced. 
Nguyen and White [2] proposed a model including the effects of electro-osmosis, diffusion of 
water, heat transfer from solid to gas and latent heat of water evaporation/condensation to study 
the water and thermal management of PEM fuel cells. They found that the ohmic loss is 
considerable at high current density and the voltage loss is twice amount of that at the cathode 
electrode. The back diffusion of the water from cathode to anode is not enough to keep the 
membrane hydrated, therefore, the reactant gas at the anode needs to be humidified. Yi and 
Nguyen [3] developed an along-the-channel model for evaluating the effects of various design 
and operating parameters on the performance of a PEM fuel cell. The results showed that the 
humidification of the anode gas is required to improve the conductivity of the membrane, and the 
liquid after injection and higher humidification temperature can enhance the cell performance by 
introducing more water into the anode. Aditionally, applying higher cathode gas pressure helps to 
replenish the water loss due to electro-osmosis and, thereby, results in more conductive 
membrane and better cell performance. 
A two-dimension model was developed by Ge and Yi [4] to investigate the effects of 
operation conditions and membrane thickness on the water transport. In their study, the liquid 
water effect on the effective porosity for gas transport was considered to simplify the model of the 
two-phase flows in porous layers. The results revealed that the cell performance can be enhanced 
by increasing the cell temperature. Mazumder and. Cole [5, 6] numerically investigated the cell 
performance of PEM fuel cells. In their studies, the effects of liquid water transport in porous 
media are taken into account. The results showed that as the current density crosses over a certain 
 4
Recently, Liu et al. [16] proposed a new flow field with baffles in the tandem array to 
augment the reactant transport and cell performance of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell. 
They found that the reactant transport and cell performance both can be enhanced by the presence 
of the baffles in the flow channel of the bipolar plate, especially at the operating conditions of low 
voltage. The beneficial baffle effects become increasingly remarkable with increasing width and/or 
number of baffles in the tandem array. Soong et al. [17] a relatively novel configuration of 
partially blocked fuel channels. The blockage effects with various gap ratios and baffle numbers on 
the reactant gas transport and the pressure loss across the channel length were emphasized. It was 
found that reducing gap size and/or increasing baffle number to enhance the reactant gas transport 
may result in a penalty of high pressure-loss. Very high pressure-loss can be generated due to high 
flow resistance at a low gap ratio combined with a low GDL porosity. They also proposed 
reasonable combinations of the influential design parameters.  
From the literatures reviews cited above, it is found that the forced convection of fuel due to 
channel blockage always leads to a pressure loss. To improve the performance of PEM fuel cells 
but with the penalty of high pressure-loss alleviated is one of the significant issues in development 
of the fuel cell technology. The partially blocked channel design mentioned above is one of the 
trials and other possibilities are still open. The objective of the present study is to investigate a new 
design of fuel channel with tapered configuration in main flow direction. A two-dimensional 
numerical model of PEMFC with tapered flow channel design at cathode is developed to employed 
to perform the exploration of the resultant transport phenomena and cell performance. 
2. Analysis 
The physical system considered is following: PEMFC consists of a proton exchange 
membrane in the middle, and two catalyst layers, two gas diffuser layers, and two flow channels 
each at the anode/cathode side. It is seen that the flow channel width at the cathode side reduces 
gradually along the main flow direction. At the cathode side, the reduction in flow area of the fuel 
channel will force the reactant gas transfer to GDL and catalyst layer as well as increase the forced 
convection in the flow direction. Firstly, the forced convection in diffuser layer would generate the 
shear stress to remove the liquid water and heat to reduce the problem of water and thermal 
management in the PEM fuel cell. Secondly, the reactant gas is easier to react in the catalyst layer, 
which in turn, causes a better cell performance. Therefore, it is appealing to have a numerical study 
on the effects of tapered flow channel design on the cell performance of PEM fuel cells. To 
simplify the analysis in the present study, the following assumptions are invoked: (1) the gas

The boundary conditions for the phase potential at the interface between the catalyst layer and 
the membrane is Φ= 0 at the anode side, and is / 0X∂Φ ∂ =  at the cathode side. Because the 
phase potential is a linear distribution in the membrane, the phase potential boundary condition can 
be written as / 0Y∂Φ ∂ = . 
 
3. Numerical Method 
The solution to the governing equations is performed using a finite volume scheme by 
dividing the model domain into a number of cells as control volumes. In the finite volume method, 
the governing equations are numerically integrated over each of these computational cells or 
control volumes. The finite volume method exploits a collocated cell-centered variable 
 10
fuel cell can be safely modeled as single phase flow. At low voltage conditions, however, the liquid 
water effects on the cell performance are remarkable and cannot be neglected in the modeling. This 
confirms the fact that the mass transport at lower voltage condition is more significant and, in turn, 
more water is generated in the catalyst layer of the cathode side. The two-phase flow effects should 
be considered at the low voltage.  
The Rch effects on the local current density distributions at V=0.7 and 0.2 V are, respectively, 
presented in Figs.3 (a) and 3(b). To investigate the liquid water effects, the results with and without 
considerations of liquid water in the modeling are both presented in Fig.3. By comparing the 
ordinates in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), it indicates that the variations of the local current density along the 
flow direction are relatively more noticeable for the conditions of low operating voltage (V=0.2V). 
It is expected that for the lower operating voltage and thus higher operating current density, the 
electrochemical reaction is stronger in the catalyst layer. Therefore, the reactant oxygen is 
consumed in a higher rate when the reactant oxygen flows along the main flow direction, which in 
turn causes the substantial variations in the local current density. A careful examination of Fig. 3 
discloses that the better cell performance is noted for the PEM fuel cell with a smaller Rch. In 
addition, the results without consideration of liquid water will overpredict the cell performance. 
In the study of reactant gas transport in PEM fuel cells, understanding of the detailed 
distributions of the fuel gases at the interface between the gas diffuser layer and catalyst layer are 
important to the design of a PEM fuel cell. To this end, the Rch Rch effects on the local distributions 
of oxygen and hydrogen mass fractions at the GDL-catalyst interface for operating voltage V = 
0.7V are presented in Fig.4. The oxygen mass fraction at the cathode side decreases along the axial 
location Y due to the chemical reaction of the oxygen. Results in Fig. 4(a) shows that, near the 
entrance (Y<0.02m), the oxygen fraction is lower for the case with a lower Rch (= 0.1), in which 
more reactant gas in the downstream part (Y > 0.02m) of the channel will be forced into the GDL 
and catalyst layers and thus result in a higher oxygen fraction. It is also found in Fig. 4(a) that the 
oxygen faction is relatively lower for the case with consideration of the liquid water effects. This is 
due to the fact the appearance of the liquid water in the PEM fuel cell will retard the oxygen 
diffusion, which in turn causes a lower oxygen fraction. As for the Rch effects on the reactant gas at 
the anode side, as shown in Fig. 4(b), the hydrogen mass faction distributions are only slightly 
affected by the variations in Rch. This confirms the general concept that the change of the cathode 
flow field has a negligible effect on the transport phenomena at the anode side. 
Thermal and water management is another one of the important issues pertaining to the 
 12
To validate the concept, the detailed gas transport phenomena and cell performance of the PEM 
fuel cells with tapered flow field design are numerically examined. What follows are the major 
findings. 
1. Generally, the application of tapered flow channel design in the bipolar plate of PEM fuel cells 
leads to a favorable consequence in fuel transport, water management and cell performance. 
The effects increase with the taper ratio of the fuel channel. 
2. The beneficial effects of the tapered flow channel become remarkable at the conditions of low 
operating voltages at high current densities. Therefore, the use of the tapered flow channel will 
force more reactant gas into the gas diffuser layer and catalyst layer, which in turn results in an 
better cell performance. 
3. It is inevitable that a penalty of pressure-loss accompanies the use of the present tapered 
channels in the flow field design of bipolar plate. However, the present results disclose that the 
pressure loss is quite low in general. It is very encouraged and demonstrates the potential of 
this new flow field design. 
4. Finally, the deviations between the predictions with and without consideration of the liquid 
water effects, especially at the operating conditions of low voltage, reveal the influences of the 
liquid water on the transport phenomena and performance of PEM fuel cells. The present 
results provide evidences for significance of the liquid water effect and imply the requirement 
of inclusion of the effect in the modeling.
