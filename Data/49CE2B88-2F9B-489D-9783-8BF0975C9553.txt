SUMMARY
This paper proposes bi-directional coupled tuned mass dampers (BiCTMDs) for the seismic response
control of two-way asymmetric-plan buildings subjected to bi-directional ground motions. The proposed
BiCTMD was developed from the three-degree-of-freedom modal system, which represents the vibration
mode of a two-way asymmetric-plan building. The performance of the proposed BiCTMD for the seismic
response control of elastic two-way asymmetric-plan buildings was verified by investigating the reductions
of the amplitudes of the associated frequency response functions. In addition, the investigation showed that
the proposed BiCTMD is effective in reducing the seismic damage of inelastic asymmetric-plan buildings.
Therefore, the BiCTMD is an effective approach for the seismic response control of both elastic and
inelastic two-way asymmetric-plan buildings. Copyright  2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

INTRODUCTION
Tuned mass dampers (TMDs) are commonly recognized as an effective approach for reducing the
seismic responses of elastic buildings [1–6]. Moreover, Rana and Soong [7] showed that a TMD
can be effectively designed for controlling the selected vibration mode of an elastic multi-story
symmetrical building. Owing to the modal contamination problem, the multiple TMD (MTMD) is
not recommended for the simultaneous control of several vibration modes of an elastic multi-story
building [7]. At the same time, the performance of elastic TMDs for displacement control is not as
good for inelastic buildings as it is for elastic buildings due to the de-tuning effect when the building
yields [8–10]. Although the reductions in the displacement responses of inelastic buildings caused
by using elastic TMDs are not significant, some researchers have confirmed that the hysteretic
energy demand of symmetrical buildings can be significantly reduced by using elastic TMDs
[9–11]. Thus, generally speaking, elastic TMDs are effective for the seismic response control of
both elastic and inelastic symmetrical buildings.
In fact, due to their architectural and functional requirements, most of the real buildings are
plan-asymmetric. Keeping in mind that the vibration modes of asymmetric buildings are translation–
rotation coupled, using a single translation-only TMD is therefore not a very effective approach
for the modal control of asymmetric-plan buildings. In order to control the coupled vibration

Dn is the nth modal coordinate of the building and is expressed as Dn = [Dxn Dzn Dn]T; Dan
is the 3×1 column vector representing the degrees of freedom in the X - and Z -translations and
Y -rotation for the BiCTMD; u¨gx and u¨gz are the ground accelerations in the two horizontal
directions; xn and zn are the X - and Z -directional modal participation factors for the nth vibration
mode; 1 is the influence vector equal to [1 1 1] and 0 is a 3×3 zero matrix. In Equation (3), uxn,
uzn and un are the N ×1 sub-vectors of the nth mode shape un of the original asymmetric-plan
building, i.e. un = [uTxn uTzn uTn]T, and m, c and k with various subscripts are the N × N sub-
matrices of the mass, damping and stiffness matrices of the original asymmetric-plan building.
The properties of the BiCTMD are set proportionally to the corresponding properties of the 3DOF
model. That is,
Man =Mn, Can =Cn, Kan = f Kn (4)
where ,  and f are the mass ratio, the damping ratio and the frequency ratio, respectively. The
value of the mass ratio  is selected by the designer and is usually around 0.05. The optimum
values of f and  for the BiCTMD are:
f = f 20n, = f0n
an
n
(5)
where f0n and an are the optimum values of the frequency ratio and the damping ratio of the
corresponding conventional TMD controlling a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) main system
with damping ratio n and mass ratio . The detailed derivation of Equation (5) is similar to
that for the CTMD [16] and is shown in the Appendix. The optimum values of f0n and an are
available in other research [3]. Since Mn , Cn and Kn are known (Equation (3)), the value of  is
selected and the optimum values of f and  are computed from Equation (5), then Man, Can and
Kan can be obtained.

in the three directions, i.e. X - and Z -translations and Y -rotation. The materials of the beams and
columns used in the 20-story building are Dual A36 Gr. 50 steel and A572 Gr. 50 steel, respectively.
The yield strength of these two steel types used in the analysis is 340 and 345 MPa, respectively.
The details of the size of the members and the mass distribution of the 20-story building can be
found in the original report [19]. Stiffness-proportional damping with the first mode damping ratio
equal to 0.02 is assumed. The properties of the 3DOF modal systems (Equation (3)) for the first
three vibration modes of the example building are listed in Table II. In addition to the example
building with a BiCTMD placed on the roof, the example building without any dampers was also
analyzed. The mass ratio  was chosen as 0.05. From other research results [3], the optimum
values of f0n and an are equal to 0.9636 and 0.1366, respectively, for the conventional TMD as
n =0.02 and =0.05. Thus, from Equation (5), the optimum values of f and  for the BiCTMD
were found to be equal to 0.046 and 0.329, respectively. The seismic responses of the example
building with and without BiCTMDs were obtained using the step-by-step numerical integration
procedure.
The two components of the ground motion recorded for the 1940 El Centro earthquake and the
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, denoted as LA03/LA04 and LA23/LA24, respectively, in the SAC
steel research project [19], were used in this study. The peak ground accelerations of these scaled
ground motion records are 0.39g/0.49g for LA03/LA04 and 0.42g/0.47g for LA23/LA24. Other
properties of these ground motion records can be found in the associated report [19]. In the elastic
analyses, the materials of the example building and the BiCTMD were assumed to be elastic. In
the inelastic analyses, the materials of the example building were assumed to be bilinear with a
post-yielding stiffness ratio equal to 0.03 and the BiCTMD remaining elastic.
Elastic seismic responses of the example building
The frequency response functions, which are general transfer functions and are independent of
the characteristics of the ground motion records, were used to investigate the effectiveness of the
proposed BiCTMD for the elastic seismic response control of the example building. The amplitudes

where all the variables in the matrices (Equation (11)) can be determined from Equation (6).
With the notation defined in Equation (11), the analytical model of the BiCTMD established in a
structural analysis program is shown in Figure 3. Here, the mass and the mass moment of inertia
are lumped at the node whose coordinate coincides with that of the CM of the j th floor. The
lumped mass is connected with three spring-dashpot sets using a rigid bar. The length of the rigid
bar is defined in terms of the eccentricities esax and esaz. The three spring-dashpot sets represent the
diagonal elements of the stiffness matrix and the damping matrix of the corresponding uncoupled
damper system. That is to say, the stiffness and the damping coefficients of the three spring-dashpot
sets are equal to ksax/csax, ksaz/csaz and ksa/c
s
a in the X - and Z -translations and rotation, respectively.
For the example building, the values ofksax/csax, ksaz/csaz, ksa/c

az are 592, 118, 743,
148, 424 963, 84 878, 6.253 and 7.559, respectively, in which the associated units of force, length
and time are correspondingly equal to kN, m and s.
It is well known that the effectiveness of TMDs is dependent upon the characteristics of the input
ground motions. Nevertheless, in order to see the real differences between the response histories
of the example building with and without the BiCTMD, the associated roof response histories
at the CM are also illustrated in Figures 4 and 5. In these elastic response history analyses, the
ground motion records LA03 and LA23 were applied in the X -direction, and the ground motion
records LA04 and LA24 were applied in the Z -direction. From Figures 4 and 5, it was found
that the reduction ratios of the peak X -translational, Z -translational and rotational displacements
for the example building under the two selected pairs of ground motion records were 9.4%, 9.4%
and 33.9% and 28.7%, 13.9% and 33.3%, respectively. Furthermore, from all of the cycles of
the displacement histories (Figures 4 and 5), the BiCTMD significantly reduced the averaged
amplitudes of the displacements in the three directions simultaneously. Figure 6 shows the X - and

study, the seismic response of the 20-story two-way asymmetric-plan building with and without the
BiCTMD was investigated. The substantial reduction of the amplitudes of the frequency response
functions confirmed the effectiveness of the BiCTMD in controlling the seismic responses of elastic
two-way asymmetric-plan buildings. The investigation results also showed that the BiCTMD is
effective in reducing the peak edge translations of two-way asymmetric-plan buildings. Although
there is a detuning effect in the proposed BiCTMD for inelastic asymmetric-plan buildings, the
results of our investigation showed that the BiCTMD can significantly reduce the strain energy
demands of the inelastic asymmetric-plan building. That is to say, the proposed BiCTMD is also
useful in reducing the seismic damage to two-way asymmetric-plan buildings under bi-directional
ground excitations.
APPENDIX A
It has been verified that Dxn = Dzn = Dn = Dn for proportionally damped elastic two-way
asymmetric-plan buildings, where Dn is the generalized modal coordinate of the nth vibration
mode [17]. Furthermore, because Man, Can , and Kan are proportional to the corresponding
properties of the nth 3DOF modal system (Equation (4)), it results in Daxn = Dazn = Dan . In the
following, Daxn , Dazn and Dan are all denoted as Dan. Thus, the displacement vector shown in
Equation (1) can be expressed as:
[
Dn
Dan
]
6×1
=
⎡
⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣

[

Substituting Equation (A1) into Equation (1) and pre-multiplying both sides of Equation (1) by[

in which:
m¯n = sum(sum(Mn)), c¯n =sum(sum(Cn)), k¯n =sum(sum(Kn))
m¯an = sum(sum(Man)), c¯an =sum(sum(Can)), k¯an =sum(sum(Kan))
(A3)
The notation sum(sum (·)) represents the summation of all the elements of the specified matrix.
The form of Equation (A2) is the same as that of the equation of motion for the SDOF main
structure controlled with a conventional TMD. From Equations (4) and (A3), it was found that:
