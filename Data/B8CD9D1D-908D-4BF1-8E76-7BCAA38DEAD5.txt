Abstract 
 
 This work considers the resolution of 
the system of fuzzy Diophantine equations. 
The concept of level sets is adopted to 
convert this problem into a crisp(traditional) 
nonlinear integer program. It is shown that 
the system of fuzzy Diophantine equations 
with concave membership functions can be 
reduced to a regular convex integer 
programming problem. The p-th power 
Lagrangian method is introduced to deal with 
the resulting convex integer programming 
problem as a sequence of linearly constrained 
convex integer programming problems. 
Moreover, due to the polyhedral nature of the 
constraint set of the linearly constrained 
convex integer program, a branch and cut 
procedure is then applied for solving the 
sequence of linearly constrained convex 
integer programming problems. Some 
computational results are included to 
illustrate the theory and solution procedure.

m -dimensional column vector. It is well 
known that the system of Diophantine 
equations have been widely used in many 
optimization and decision making problems, 
such as the market share problems[1][4], and 
certain portfolio planning problems[9]. Due 
to the vagueness involves in the real world 
decision problems, the system of Diophantine 
equations in a fuzzy environment becomes an 
important problem both in theory and in 
applications. This work considers the system 
of fuzzy Diophantine equations in the 
following form.

This work focuses on the case that the

this case, from the theory of convex analysis 
[13], we have the following simple result. 
Lemma 1. If )(xh  is continuous, strictly

Lemma 1 and problem (5) directly lead to the

For the numerical treatment of the convex 
integer programming problems, various 
methods have been proposed in the literature 
[5,7,15]. Computational difficulty, however, 
may be caused by the nonlinear constraints 
(6b) and (6c) when outer approximation 
algorithm [7] or branch and bound method [5] 
is adopted to solve the problem (6). In this 
work, the p-th power Lagrangian method, 
which offers a success guarantee for the dual 
search in generating an optimal solution of 
the problem (6) in an equivalent setting via 
two key transformations is introduced. 
According to [11], the problem (6) has the 
following equivalent form for a suitable p>0 
and λ >0.

Moreover, a solution algorithm of the p-th 
power Lagrangian method is designed to 
solve the problem (7) by considering a 
sequence of the following linearly

problems.
