with the Doppler effect spoils the orthogonality 
between subcarriers and, hence, leads to severe 
inter-carrier interference (ICI). We develop a time 
varying finite impulse response (TV-FIR) channel 
shortening filter using the basis expansion model 
which allows us to turn a complicated equalization 
problem into an equivalent simpler equalization 
problem, containing only the BEM coefficients of both 
the doubly selective channel and the TV-FIR. Owing to 
the fact, TV-FIR optimizes the performance over all 
subcarriers in a joint mode； it doesn＇t have a 
satisfactory performance. An ideal frequency-domain 
per-tone equalizer (PTEQ) is then obtained by 
changing the TV-FIR operation to the frequency 
domain.

1. Introduction 
In recent years, unprecedented demand for 
wireless data service has been driven by smart 
phones. MIMO technique which uses multiple 
antennas in the transmitter and receiver is well 
known as the key technology in future 
wireless system to increase data rate and 
reliability. OFDM/CDMA system combines 
the advantages OFDM and CDMA, can 
counteract frequency selective fading and 
support multiple data rate service according to 
the demand of customers [1]. 
 The channel can not be assumed to be 
static in high speed mobile radio systems. 
Hence, the orthogonality between the 
subcarriers is destroyed, and inter-carrier 
interference(ICI) is induced. Multipath delay 
spread longer than the cyclic prefix (CP) will 
leads to inter-block interference (IBI) where 
traditional one-tap frequency equalizer will 
not render acceptable performance. In this 
project, the doubly selective fading channel 
with delay spread longer than the CP for 
MIMO OFDM/CDMA downlink transmission 
is investigated. To solve the above-mentioned 
issues, conventional block linear equalizers 
(BLE)[2] which combine equalization and 
multiuser detection are too complex to be 
realized. However, using the basis expansion 
model (BEM)[3], an equalizer which consists 
of a time varying finite impulse response 
(TV-FIR) channel shortening filter cascaded 
with one-tap frequency-domain equalizer 
(FEQ) is proposed [4]. An optimum PTEQ [5] 
is then obtained by converting the TV-FIR 
operation to the frequency domain. The 
proposed PTEQ optimizes the performance on 
each subcarrier separately. Based on the 
references, we expect to get an equalizer with  
better performance and lower complexity in 
the project.  
 
2. System Model 
2.1 The Considered System 
The considered system is with tN  transmit 
antennas and rN  receive antennas and is 
shown in Fig. 1. The thµ  user data symbol is 
spreaded by the spreading code )(µc  of 
length N . The spreaded signals are then 
spatially multiplexed across tN  transmit 
antennas. The input chip sequence is then 
OFDM modulated and a cyclic prefix (CP) is 
inserted in each block. ][)( ib tk  is the spreaded 
symbol transmitted on the thk  subcarrier of 
the thi   OFDM block at the tht  transmit 
antenna. So the transmitted signal is as

frequency domain equalization (PTEQ) 
channel shortening filter in a MIMO system is

channel shortening filter is to transform the 
doubly selective channel into a purely

3. Simulation Results 
MIMO system with 2=tN  transmit 
antennas and 2=rN  and 4 receive 
antennas are simulated. The channel is 
doubly selective fading with 6=L  and 
100max =f . The channel impulse responses 
are simulated as independently identically 
distributed (i.i.d) random variables according 
to Jake’s model and all paths are 
uncorrelated. Quadrature phase shifted 
keying (QPSK), Hadamard code with 
32=N  and 64 and CP length 3=v  are 
used in the simulations. The BEM 
coefficients of the approximated channel are 
estimated as proposed in [7] and BEM model 
with NK 2=  and 4=Q  are used to 
design the proposed equalizer. 
The TIR have length 3'' =L , the channel 
shortening filter has 91' =+L  taps, and each 
tap is modeled by 91' =+Q  time-varying 
complex exponential basis functions. The 
proposed frequency domain equalization 
(PTEQ) can be obtained by changing the 
above mentioned TIR to the frequency 
domain. Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 show the PTEQ 
BER performance of MIMO OFDM/CDMA 
systems with Gold sequence of length 
31N =  generated with parity polynomials 
2 51 D D+ +  and 2 4 51 D D D+ + + ,  and 
63N = with parity polynomials 
2 5 61 D D D+ + + and 2 3 5 6D D D D+ + + , 
respectively. Fig. 4 to Fig. 5. show that the 
performance will degrade with increasing 
multiple users beacuse of the increased 
multiple user interference. However, there is 
tremendous performance gain when the 
number of received antennas rN  is 
increased from 2 to 4 because of received 
diversity gain. Finally, these simulation 
figures show that the proposed receiver can 
effectively eliminate MAI, IBI and ICI.  
4. Conclusions 
In this project, we consider the receiver for 
MIMO OFDM/CDMA transmission over 
doubly selective channels. The TV FIR 
channel shortening filter and one-tap FEQ are 
derived by using BEM channel model. The 
PTEQ can be obtained by transferring the 
TV-FIR operations to the frequency domain. 
With increased receiver diversity, the 
proposed receiver can effectively eliminate 
MAI, IBI and ICI with reasonable complexity.

Abstract—A N -ary biorthogonal pulse position shape modula-
tion (BPPSM) for hybrid time-hopping/direct-sequence (TH/DS)
multiple access ultra-wideband (UWB) system is proposed and
analyzed in this paper. The characteristic function (CHF) of the
multiple access interference (MAI) is derived and, accordingly,
the average symbol error rate (SER) of the proposed system
can be accurately evaluated. Simulation are carried out to verify
the analytical results in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
channel and to illustrate the system performance in realistic UWB
fading channels. As increasing the number of adopting pulses, the
proposed TH/DS N -ary BPPSM system can provide better SER
performance compared with the TH/DS N -ary BPPM scheme.
Given the constraints of ﬁxed bit rate and signal bandwidth, the
impact of adjusting various system parameters on the system
performance is also investigated.
I. INTRODUCTION
1Using extremely large bandwidth of the transmitted signal,
the UWB technology is suitable to provide multiple access
capability and counteract multiple access interference (MAI)
[1]. Impulse radio (IR) technique which transmits a train
of impulses (termed monocycles) with very short duration
to deliver message symbols has been widely applied in
UWB communication. Typically, the pulse-based modulation
schemes which are usually employed in the IR UWB systems
are the pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), the pulse position
modulation (PPM), and the pulse position amplitude modula-
tion (PPAM). In PPAM modulation, both the position and the
amplitude of impulses are used to denote the data message
[10]-[11]. A biorthogonal PPM (BPPM) [11] has the antipolar
amplitudes of the modulated signals and can provide the best
performance compared with other PPAM signaling with multi-
level amplitudes of the modulated signals. For these mentioned
modulations, a single type of impulse called as the second
order Gaussian monocycle has been widely used to deliver
the message symbols.
Recently, some design algorithms were proposed to pro-
duce several sets of the orthonormal pulses such as Prolate
Spheroidal Wave Functions (PSWF) [13] or Modiﬁed Hermite
(MH) polynomials [14] [15]. These orthonormal (MH or
PSFW) pulses, which satisfy the spectral mask requested by
the Federal Communication Commission (FCC), are short in
time and have a constant pulse width, irrespective of the

Taiwan under Contract NSC 100-2221-E-005-050.
pulse’s order. When we have a set of the orthonormal pulses,
the pulse shape modulation (PSM) is an alternative modulation
scheme in which the data message is conveyed in the shape of
impulses [16]. To achieve the larger modulation level for the
pulse-based modulation, M(= PQ)-ary pulse position shape
modulation (PPSM) which consists of P -ary PPM and Q-ary
PSM modulation was introduced [17]. A biorthogonal PPSM
(BPPSM), which is an antipodal version of PPSM signals,
can carry one more bit in the amplitudes of impulse [17].
Furthermore, BPPSM signaling has been shown to provide
better performance compared with BPPM and BPSM schemes.
In order to reduce the impact of multiple access inter-
ference on the system performance, the time hopping (TH)
scheme is widely employed as the MA techniques in the
IR UWB systems. Recently, in the binary modulations TH-
UWB system, the usage of the random polarities in the pulse’s
amplitudes (called a coded system in [6]) not only remove
the discrete spectral of the transmitted signal, but also provide
the better performance compared with uncoded system [4]-[6].
The advantage of using random polarity is also conﬁrmed for
the nonbinary (N -ary) modulation system [12]. Therefore, in
the paper, a N -ary BPPSM TH system including the random
polarities in the pulse’s amplitudes (namely the hybrid TH/DS
N -ary BPPSM UWB system) is proposed and the accurate
SER performance of the proposed system is also calculated.
In asynchronous MA scenarios, the performance evalua-
tions of the TH-UWB systems using nonbinary modulation
schemes have been investigated in [7]-[9],[10]-[11],[15]-[16].
Regarding to the M -ary PPM [7], N -ary BPPM [10][11] and
N -ary BPPSM [17], the system performances of these TH
UWB systems were analyzed based on that the statistics of
MAIs are assumed by Gaussian distribution. However, the
Gaussian approximation (GA) fails to model the distribution
of MAIs precisely due to the impulse-like in the distribution
of MAI. Recently, using the analytical frameworks based on
the characteristic functions (CFH) techniques, the accurate
performance analyses of binary PPM TH, M -ary PPM TH
and N -ary BPPM TH/DS UWB systems were presented in
[3], [9] and [12], respectively. However, to the best of our
knowledge, the CFH analytical scheme has not been applied
to analyze the N -ary BPSM or N -ary BPPSM in the MA
TH-UWB systems.
In the following sections, the N -ary BPPSM applied in
hybrid TH/DS system is introduced. Based on the derived

According to the notations employed to model the asyn-
chronous (random) time delay of the kth user for binary
modulation [2], we deﬁne τk = αkTf +∆k. Since these asyn-
chronous time delays, {τk}Nuk=2, are modeled as the uniformly
distributed RVs over one symbol interval, αk is a discrete
uniformly distributed RV on {0, 1, ..., Ns − 1}, and ∆k is a
continuous uniformly distributed RV over one frame interval,
i.e. 0 ≤ ∆k < Tf . Afterward, only the ﬁrst message symbol
of the desired user u(1)0 = (p
(1)
0 , q
(1)
0 , r
(1)
0 ) is considered in the
following. After some mathematical manipulations, the signal
of the kth interfering user appeared on the (m,n)th correlator’s
output in the jth frame duration can be derived as

(10)
where only two (previous u(k)−1 and current u(k)0 ) message
symbols of the kth interference user are hitting to the ﬁrst
message symbol of the desired user. Therefore, we deﬁne
(p(k,j), q(k,j), r(k,j))

(11)
Since the received signals of the interference users come from
different transmission paths, {I(k)m,n}Nuk=2 in (9) are assumed
to be mutually independent random variables. Therefore, the
CHF of the total MAI can be given by
ΦIm,n(ω) =

In addition, the message symbols of the kth interference user,
p
(k)
i , q
(k)
i and r
(k)
i , are assumed to be equally likely RVs with
p
(k)
i ∈ {0, 1, 2, ..., P−1}, q(k)i ∈ {0, 1, 2, ..., Q−1} and r(k)i ∈
{0, 1}, respectively. Without loss of generality, the TH code
of the desired user is assumed to be c(1)j,n = 0 for all j and n.
Besides, each element of the random TH (c(k)j,q ) and random
DS code (a(k)j,q ) of the kth user is assumed to be an uniformly
distributed RV. Therefore, two MAI components, Um,n and
Vm,n, are generated corresponding to the previous and current
data symbols of the kth interference user, respectively. The
CHFs of Um,n and Vm,n conditioned on τk are respectively
derived as

(13) as

Finally, based on the maximum likelihood decision rule
for AWGN channel [19], the receiver of the desired user
computes the PQ decision statistic {rp,q}P−1,Q−1p=0,q=0 in (7) and
then chooses the index corresponding to the largest of the
absolute value for PQ decision variables as the estimate of
the message symbol p̂(1)i , q̂
(1)
i ,
p̂(1), q̂(1) = argmax
p∈{0,1,...,P−1},q∈{0,1,...,Q−1}
|rp,q| (17)
as well as
r̂(1) =
{
1, rp̂(1),q̂(1) < 0
0, rp̂(1),q̂(1) > 0

B. Symbol Error Probability
Without loss of generality, we only consider the ﬁrst data
symbol, u(1)0 = (p
(1)
0 , q
(1)
0 , r
(1)
0 ) = (0, i, 0), transmitted from
the desired user. To simplify the analysis of SER, the de-
cision statistics of total PQ(= M/2) correlators’ outputs
{rm,n}P−1,Q−1m=0,n=0 are generally assumed to be independent [8]-
[12]. According to our derived CHF of the MAI component
at the correlator’s outputs in (16) and the SER expression of
the N -ary biorthogonal modulation in [12][19], the SER of
the proposed system can be derived as
SER = 1− 1
Q
Q−1∑
i=0
∫ +∞

{[
Fr1,i(λ)− Fr1,i(−λ)
]P−1
·
Q−1∏
j =i
[
Fr0,j (λ)− Fr0,j (−λ)
]P · fr0,i(λ)
 dλ (19)
where Frm,n(λ) is the cumulative distribution function (CDF)
of rm,n. Due to the assumptions of (p(1)0 , q
(1)
0 , r
(1)
0 ) = (0, i, 0),
only the output of r0,i has the desired signal component (i.e.
r0,i = S0,i + I0,i + N0,i) and the other totally PQ − 1
correlators’ outputs are {rm,n}m =0,n =i = Im,n + Nm,n.
Since the MAI and the AWGN are assumed to be mutually
independent, the CHF of r0,j and r1,i can be expressed as
Φr0,j (ω) = ΦI0,j (ω)ΦN (ω) and Φr1,i(ω) = ΦI1,i(ω)ΦN (ω),
respectively, where ΦN (ω) = e−σ
