Abstract 
This project mainly uses the composite right/left-handed (CRLH) transmission line 
(TL) technique to develop the microwave balanced amplifier (BA) and push-pull 
amplifier (PPA) and image-reject mixer (IRM). The circuit design concept, 
implementation, and verification results are presented in the project. 
The circuit performances of the BA, PPA and IRM are depended on the 
characteristics of the quadrature hybrid couplers and baluns. As the phase difference 
bandwidths of the couplers and baluns can be effectively broaden, the circuit 
performances of the BA, PPA, and IRM can be significantly improved. In this project, 
firstly the principle of the CRLH TL are discussed, and then the broadband quadrature 
power splitter (QPS) and balun are developed using the CRLH TLs. Moreover, the 
developed broadband QPS and balun are exploited to implement the BA, PPA, and 
IRM.  
Based on the simulated and measured results of this project, it demonstrates that 
using the developed broadband QPS and balun to design the BA, PPA, and IRM can 
effectively improve the circuit performances. For the balanced amplifier, it has the 
input/output return loss of better than 10 dB with 97.9% relative bandwidth and the 
noise figure of less than 3 dB with 124% relative bandwidth. For the pull-push amplifier, 
it has a second harmonic suppression of better than 30 dB with 67% relative bandwidth. 
For the image-reject mixer, it has the RF return loss of better than 10 dB with 97.9% 
relative bandwidth, and the image rejection ratio of better than 30 dB with 104% and 
97% relative bandwidths in the LSB and USB output ports, respectively.

由(1.4)可繪出圖 1.2 [1]並可從中獲得傳輸線的群速 g( )

由圖 1.1 得知，複合式左/右手傳輸線可視為串聯及並聯諧振電路的組合，且
一般來說複合式左/右手傳輸線之串聯及並聯諧振頻率並不相同，此現象稱為左手

1-2 研究目的 
本計劃主要目的係研製平衡式放大器(balanced amplifier)、推挽式放大器
(balanced amplifier)及映像頻帶消除混波器(image reject mixer)。該類主動微波電路
其電路效能主要係由 90°耦合器及平衡-不平衡轉換器特性所決定，因此，若能有
效增加 90°耦合器及平衡-不平衡轉換器兩輸出埠之相位差頻寬，並用以設計該類
主動電路，則將有效提升這些微波元件之性能。 
基於前述之複合式左/右手傳輸線理論可知，傳輸線之相位響應得以使用複合
式左/右手傳輸線任意合成獲得。因此本計劃將使用複合式左/右手傳輸線研製具
90°及 180°相位差之寬頻微波功率分配器，並據以設計平衡式放大器，推挽式放大
器及映像頻帶消除混波器。 
1-3 章節說明 
本計劃將在第二章介紹使用複合式左/右手傳輸線設計具 90°及 180°相位差之
寬頻微波功率分配器的設計概念、電路製作及模擬量測結果。第三章則將敘述應
用第二章研製之寬頻功率分配器設計平衡式放大器、推挽式放大器及映像頻帶消
除混波器。第四章將總結使用複合式左/右手傳輸線設計微波主、被電路之電路性

其中 diffφ 為90°或180°，由於複合式左/右手傳輸線是由左手及右手微帶線所構成，
因此複合式左/右手傳輸線之相位響應可表示成左手及右手傳輸線之組合[5] , [6]，

圖 2.2 之電路模擬工作係先使用 Agilent Momentumru 進行微帶線部份之電磁
全波模擬，再將模擬結果匯入 Agilent ADS，俾利後續電路模擬工作。實現功率分
配器所需使用之集總元件電路(如威爾金森功率分配器之100 Ω電阻及左手傳輸線
之電感電容網路)則先使用網路分析儀量測其 S 參數，再與全波模擬結果一起代入
Agilent ADS 電路模擬軟體進行整合模擬。最後再微調傳統微帶線長度，使其符合
設計規格。圖 2.3 為模擬及測量結果，由該圖 2.3(a)可知，反射係數約有 187 MHz
的頻偏(9.4 %)，推測可能的原因為 (1)電路製作的尺寸誤差 (2)使用集總元件所造
成的頻率偏移。但該結果仍然在可接受範圍內。圖 2.3(a)及(b)分別為 90°相位差之
功率分配器之輸入反射係數及兩輸出埠間的隔離度效能，其量測之反射係數 11S ，
從 0.85 GHz 到 3.46 GHz 皆低於 10 dB− ，量測之隔離度 32S ，頻率從 0.9 GHz 到
3.3 GHz 皆大於 10 dB。圖 2.3(c)及(d)分別為兩輸出端對輸入端之穿透係數 21S 及

不平衡(即 31 21S S− )，從 0.5 GHz 到 3.5 GHz 的頻率範圍內大約為 0.9 dB。 
於 90°相位差之功率分配器的兩輸出埠間量測到的相位差如圖 2.5 所示。在頻

器亦一併製作，其測量結果如圖 2.6 所示，本計劃所研製之功率分配器其相對頻寬
遠比其它兩者之相對頻寬大。其他研究團隊所提出的 90o 相位差功率分配器與本計
劃所研製的新型功率分配器之元件效能整理於表 2.1 中。雖然本計劃使用印刷電路
板製作，較不易控制製程品質及考慮相關雜散效應，但若與使用積體電路製作之
功率分配器比較，仍可獲得相當優異的相位差頻寬特性。

振幅不平衡(即 31 21S S− )，從 1.24 GHz 到 3.85 GHz，其最大振幅不平衡大約為 0.7 
dB。於 180°相位差之功率分配器的兩輸出埠間量測到的相位差如圖 2.10 所示，在
設計頻率 1f 和 2f  (即 1.4 GHz 和 2.6 GHz)，其相位差分別是 180.2°和 177.7° 。此
外，當考慮180 10°± 的相位差時，則可達到 97 %的相對頻寬 1，其頻率範圍為 1.24 
GHz 到 3.58 GHz。若使用設計中心頻率 0f 來計算 10°± 誤差之相對頻寬時，則可獲
得 117 %的相對頻寬 2。 
為了與其它具有相同特性之微波元件比較，環形耦合器及由兩個不同長度之
傳統微帶線所構成的功率分配器，亦設計及製作於 2 GHz 之中心頻率，其量測結
果一併顯示於圖 2.11。若考慮相位頻寬特性之良窳，本文所提出之電路架構，明
顯優於傳統具 180°相位差輸出的微波元件。使用複合式左/右手傳輸線實現 180°相
位差功率分配器之電路特性比較彙整成表 2.2。本文所研製的 180°相位差功率分配
器，其相位頻寬顯著地提高，主要係因使用左手傳輸線之相位響應可任意合成的
概念，並使用兩個合成頻率點有效地控制左手傳輸線的相位響應曲線。 
在本章中，使用複合式左/右手傳輸線設計之 90°及 180°相位差功率分配器已
完成設計、製作和實驗驗證。2-2 與 2-3 節中的測量結果可驗證第 2-1 節所敘述之
設計概念，並驗證使用複合式左/右手傳輸線製作 90°及 180°相位差之功率分配器
是一種有效提高相位差頻寬的方法。 
如圖 2.3 和圖 2.8 所示，由 Murata 0603 晶片電感及電容所構成的左手傳輸線，
不會貢獻嚴重的衰減。若應用前瞻製程(如微波積體電路或低溫共燒陶瓷)設計本計
劃所提出電路架構，則有潛力助於其提升相對頻寬。此外，兩輸出埠間的振幅不

由(3.6)可知，若兩放大器完全相同，則 11 0S = ，因此改善了輸入端的阻抗匹配 
[12]。同理，在平衡式放大器的輸出端也有相同的結果。因此理想平衡式放大器毋
需考慮輸入及輸出端之阻抗匹配。 
因兩 90°耦合器被用來抵銷兩放大器在輸入及輸出端所產生之反射波，故平衡
式放大器之輸入及輸出端之匹配性能係由 90°混合耦合器特性決定。因此若可有效
增加 90°耦合器兩輸出埠之相位差頻寬，則能增加平衡式放大器輸入及輸出端之反
射損失的頻寬(return loss bandwidth)。如圖 3.1 之電路架構所示，90°耦合器可用各
種不同的電路架構來實現，例如枝幹耦和器(branch-line couplers , BLCs)、藍吉耦

較小之電路面積和較易電路積體化之優點。在推挽式放大器電路架構中，第一個
balun 用於將輸入訊號分為大小相等且相位相差 180°之訊號，並同時饋入兩個功率
場效電晶體，由於功率晶體偏壓在 Class B，亦即偏壓於夾止電壓(pinch-off

動訊號。混波器係利用非線性元件之平方律(square law)特性達到轉換輸入訊號率
的功能。微波二極體及電晶體為最常使用的非線性元件，並根據是否使用外加偏
壓，區分為被動式或主動式混波器。由於混波器是利用元件非線性部分來達到轉
換頻率的功能，因此在訊號經調變後，除了欲獲得的 IF 訊號外，還會額外產生一
組與 IF 訊號同樣位置之雜訊訊號。如圖 3.17 所示，此 IF 雜訊訊號是因為以 LO 的
頻率為準時，輸入 RF 訊號和映像訊號(image signal)各在 LO 訊號頻率的兩側，並
與 LO 訊號擁有相同的頻率差，因此，經混頻後此兩訊號將落在相同位置上，遂導
致電路的雜訊量增加，雜訊位移(noise floor)上升，且同時降低系統的動態範
（dynamic range）。所以，如何去除映像訊號是一個重要的研究課題。一般去除映
像訊號之方法為使用濾波器或使用映像頻帶消除混波器(image reject mixer , IRM)
實現，本計劃則係使用後者來抑制映像訊號。 
傳統映像消除頻帶混波器電路架構如圖 3.18 所示，該電路包含了兩個混波器
及兩個 90°耦合器，其中，混波器通常接用雙平衡式混波器(double balanced mixer)。
圖中 3 dB 同相功率分配器則用於將 LO 訊號等量分配，並饋入兩個混波器之 LO
埠。映像頻帶消除混波器可將 IF 響應在頻譜上分離成兩個不同邊帶(sideband)，若
RF 訊號高於 LO 頻率時，則稱為上邊帶(upper sideband , USB)，將出現在其中一個

映像訊號抑制，則相位誤差須在 10°以下，振幅不平衡須在 1 dB 以下，才可達到
20 dB 以上的映像訊號抑制效果。 
由(3.16)可知，映像頻帶消除混波器之映像訊號抑制的良寙係由 RF 及 IF 兩 90°

Compact LTCC Rat-Race Couplers
Using Multilayered Phase-Delay and
Phase-Advance T-Equivalent Sections
Chao-Hsiung Tseng, Member, IEEE
Abstract—In this paper, compact low-temperature co-fired ce-
ramic (LTCC) rat-race couplers are developed using multilayered
phase-delay and phase-advance T-equivalent sections. By taking
advantage of the multilayered LTCC layout capability, compact
3-D phase-delay and phase-advance T-equivalent sections are de-
signed, and then treated as fundamental elements to construct two
types of LTCC rat-race couplers. One type of coupler consists of
three phase-delay and a phase-advance sections, whereas the other
type coupler is integrated by a phase-delay and three phase-ad-
vance sections. At the design frequency 2 GHz, both two types
of couplers occupy       mm  circuit sizes, namely areas of

I. INTRODUCTION
T HE rat-race coupler, also referred to as the ring coupler,is a key component in microwave and millimeter-wave
range. Due to its simple circuit structure and superior properties,
such as a flat phase difference response between outputs and a
high isolation between ports, one can find various applications
in mixers, multipliers [1], power amplifiers [2], [3], and antenna
feeding networks [4].
The circuit configurations of the [5] and [6] con-
ventional rat-race couplers, are shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b), re-
spectively. As a signal is applied to port 1 ( port), two equal
and in-phase components will appear at port 2 and port 3 while
port 4 will be isolated. On the other hand, as port 4 ( port) is ex-
cited, two equal and out-of-phase components will be obtained
at port 2 and port 3, and port 1 will be isolated. However, the
conventional rat-race couplers occupy large circuit sizes so that
the manufacturing cost reduction and the compact requirement
of the wireless communication systems are not easily satisfied.

Therefore, for circuit miniaturization, compact planar
rat-race couplers have been designed using a variety of minia-
turized techniques, such as slow-wave artificial transmission
lines [7]–[9], folded microstrips [10], [11], left-handed artificial
transmission lines [12], lumped-elements [6], [13]–[17], and
phase inverters [18], [19]. In addition, using the low tempera-
ture cofired ceramics (LTCC) process is beneficial to exploit
the multilayered layout capability for developing compact
RF-system-on-package modules [20], [21], and various mi-
crowave components, like branch-line couplers [22], filters
[23], [24], baluns [25], [26], and antennas [27].
In this paper, by integrating advantages of above-mentioned
miniaturized techniques, compact rat-race couplers will be
developed using the lumped phase-delay and phase-advance
T-equivalent sections realized in a multilayered LTCC sub-
strate. The multilayered T-equivalent sections with a 90 phase
delay and a 90 phase advance will be designed in this paper.
They will be treated as fundamental elements to construct two
types of compact rat-race couplers shown in Fig. 1(c) and (d).
Referring to [6], the and transmission lines in
Fig. 1(a) and (b) can be replaced by T- or -equivalent low-pass
and high-pass lumped networks respectively. The rat-race
coupler has been realized by combining either three low-pass
and 1 high-pass networks or three high-pass and 1 low-pass
networks. Moreover, the multisection connections of lumped
circuits [14], [15] are utilized to effectively improve the oper-
ating bandwidth of the coupler. By this design approach, the
couplers have been implemented using chip components [6]
and integrated circuit processes [14], [15]. On the other hand,
since the left-handed artificial transmission line can provide
a phase-advance response, it is exploited to implement an
equivalent transmission line, and then applied to realize a
bandwidth-enhanced rat-race coupler [12].
As shown in Fig. 1, the design ideas of the miniaturized cou-
plers in this paper are to replace the conventional and
transmission lines by multilayered LTCC 90 phase-delay and
phase-advance sections, respectively. Obviously, the type-II
coupler is a complementary configuration of type-I coupler.
The effectiveness of two circuit configurations will be experi-
mentally verified in this paper.

of the mutual inductances are different from the circuit models
in [21], [22], [31]. By applying the extraction method in [31],
the element values of the complete circuit model in Fig. 2(c)
are , , , and
. The responses of the complete circuit model are
plotted in Fig. 3(b), and the full-wave simulated results of the
LTCC layout are also given for comparison. It is obvious that
the complete circuit model can predict the wideband responses
more accurately.
C. Phase-Advance T-Equivalent Section
As shown in Fig. 4(a), the phase-advance section is realized
by cascading two T-equivalent phase-advance unit-cells [28],
[29]. This cascaded configuration can shift the cutoff frequency
of the phase-advance section to a lower frequency, hence ex-
tending the operating frequency range [32]. In addition, since
two shunt inductors are utilized in design, the corresponding
multilayered circuit layout in the LTCC substrate shown in
Fig. 4(b) has a similar layout structure to that of the phase-delay
section shown in Fig. 2(b). It is helpful to flexibly integrate
phase-delay and phase-advance sections into rat-race couplers
shown in Fig. 1(c) and (d).
The series capacitor, , shown in Fig. 4(a) is formed be-
tween the layer 6 and 7 metal plates, while the capacitor
is achieved by cascading two capacitors and formed between
the layer 5 and 6 metal plates. Similar to the phase-delay section,
Fig. 4. (a) Simple circuit model, (b) 3-D LTCC layout, and (c) complete circuit
model of the two-cell phase-advance T-equivalent section.
the shunt inductor, , is also realized by the 3-D helical-like in-
ductor, and formed on layers 1–4. Metallic vias between layers
are used to connect the 150- metal strips of the inductor.
To design a 70.7- section with a 90 phase advance at
2 GHz, the element values of the two-cell T-equivalent circuit
in Fig. 4(a) are and , which are
calculated by design equations in [29]. The Ansoft HFSS is
used to design capacitors and inductors, and verify the prop-
erties of the phase-advance section as illustrated in Fig. 4(b).
Shown in Fig. 5 are the simulated results of the phase-advance
section. The is better than 10 dB from 1.1 to 3 GHz,
while is greater than 0.3 dB over the frequency range
of 1.2–2.82 GHz. Fig. 5(a) also illustrates the responses of the
two-cell T-equivalent circuit in Fig. 4(a). At design frequency,
the responses can be reasonably achieved by the simplified
equivalent circuit in Fig. 4(a).
In addition, this equivalent section has a 90.5 phase advance
at 2 GHz. Since the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 4(a) has
an inherent highpass characteristic, the transmission coefficient
is decreased to about 3 dB at 1.06 GHz. Simulated re-
sults reveal that in the frequency range of 1–3 GHz, the phase-
advance section has a wider effective bandwidth than that of the
phase-delay section because of the use of two cascaded T-equiv-
alent unit cells.
Fig. 4(c) shows the complete circuit model of the two-cell
phase-advance section including parasitic effects and mutual
couplings. Herein, the “dot” locations of the mutual inductances

IV. RESULTS
A. Measurement Method
To evaluate the circuit performance, in this paper, the couplers
under test are first mounted on the evaluation circuit broad, as
shown in Fig. 8(a). Then the four-port measurements are per-
formed using the Agilent E5071B ENA. For this purpose, the
circuit layouts shown in Fig. 6 are slightly modified in fabri-
cation. Four feeding microstrip lines of the coupler, shown in
Fig. 6, are extended, and then linked to the backside of the LTCC
substrate. As revealed in Fig. 7(c), four pads on the backside of
the LTCC substrate are utilized to solder the LTCC coupler on
the evaluation broad.
The evaluation circuit broad shown in Fig. 8(a) is mainly
composed of four 50- microstrip lines and fabricated on the
RO4003 substrate with a 0.508 mm thickness and a dielectric
constant of 3.38. To eliminate the effects of four microstrip
lines and SMA connectors, the thru-reflection-line (TRL) cal-
ibration kits, shown in Fig. 8(b), are utilized to calibrate the
four-port ENA [34]. The measured four-port S-parameters are
carried out from 1 to 3 GHz.

To give the explicit description, in this paper, the return loss
bandwidth is defined as a frequency range with a reflection co-
efficient better than 10 dB. The insertion loss bandwidth is
defined as the frequency range with a transmission coefficient
greater than 4 dB, while the isolation bandwidth is defined
as a frequency range with a transmission coefficient lower than
10 dB. In addition, the amplitude imbalance bandwidth is de-
fined as a frequency range within the 0.5 dB amplitude vari-
ation. The fractional bandwidth is calculated by

Fig. 10 are the measured and simulated S-parameters when
port 4 is treated as the input port. In Fig. 10(a), the measured
return loss bandwidth is from 1.24 to 3 GHz (83%), while the
measured insertion loss between ports 2 and 4 is from 1.03 to
2.3 GHz (76.3%). At 2 GHz, the and are 20.2 dB
and 3.3 dB, respectively. As shown in Fig. 10(b), a 43.6%
insertion loss bandwidth between ports 3 and 4 (1.67–2.6
GHz) and a 73.1% isolation bandwidth (1.18–2.54 GHz) are
measured. At 2 GHz, the and are 3.47 dB and 39
dB, respectively. The amplitude imbalance bandwidth shown
in Fig. 10(c) is from 1.86 to 2.23 GHz (18%) while the phase
difference varies from 186 to 187.3 .
C. Measured and Simulated Results of Type-II Coupler
Presented in Fig. 11 are the measured and simulated S-pa-
rameters of the type-II rat-race coupler when port 1 is treated
as the input port. As illustrated in Fig. 11(a), a 60.7% return
loss bandwidth (1.39–2.6 GHz) and a 57.1% insertion loss band-
width (1.35–2.43 GHz) between ports 1 and 2 are measured. At
2 GHz, the measured and are 17.5 dB and 3.16
dB, respectively. In Fig. 11(b), the measured insertion loss band-
width between ports 1 and 3 is from 1.72 to 2.75 GHz (46.1%),
while the measured isolation bandwidth is 1.2–2.8 GHz (80%).
At 2 GHz, the and are 3.72 dB and 22.8 dB,
respectively. In addition, the amplitude imbalance bandwidth
shown in Fig. 11(c) is from 2.03 to 2.33 GHz (13.8%), while
the phase difference varies from to .
For completeness, the S-parameters with port 4 excitation are
also measured. Presented in Fig. 12 are the measured and sim-
ulated S-parameters when port 4 is treated as the input port. In
Fig. 12(a), the measured return loss bandwidth is from 1.45 to
2.85 GHz (65.1%), while the measured insertion loss between
ports 2 and 4 is from 1.7 to 2.97 GHz (54.4%). At 2 GHz, the
and are 19.6 dB and 3.66 dB, respectively. As
shown in Fig. 12(b), a 55.7% insertion loss bandwidth between
ports 3 and 4 (1.36–2.41 GHz) and an 80% isolation bandwidth
(1.2–2.8 GHz) are measured. At 2 GHz, the and
are 3.16 dB and 22.8 dB, respectively. The amplitude im-
balance bandwidth shown in Fig. 12(c) is from 1.98 to 2.34
GHz (16.6%), while the phase difference varies from 178.8 to
179.1 .
Regardless of the amplitude imbalance and considering a
phase error, the developed type-I coupler has a 60% in-phase
bandwidth ( over 1.28–2.39 GHz) and a 43% out-of-
phase bandwidth ( over 1.51–2.34 GHz), while the
type-II coupler has a 61.2% in-phase bandwidth ( over
1.35–2.54 GHz) and a 55.3% out-of-phase bandwidth (
over 1.48–2.61 GHz). The results in Section IV demonstrated
that using multilayered LTCC phase-delay and phase-advance
T-equivalent sections is an effective approach to design compact
and performance-enhanced rat-race couplers.
D. Comparisons of Circuit Size and Performances
Table I reveals the circuit size comparisons of 90 and 180
LTCC couplers. Besides the LTCC rat-race coupler in [17], the
properties of a 90 commercial coupler are also given for ref-
erence. Shown in Table II are circuit performance comparisons
between the coupler in [17] and this work. Except for the return

loss, the bandwidths of the amplitude imbalance, isolation, and
phase difference are improved. It demonstrates that the design
approach developed in this paper is effective for implementing
a compact LTCC rat-race coupler and improving the circuit per-
formances.

Fig. 3. Even-mode and odd-mode impedances versus the slot and strip widths.
II. DESIGN OF PROPOSED MARCHAND BALUN
The slot-coupled microstrip line is implemented in a two-lay-
ered dielectric substrate with three metallic layers as shown in
Fig. 2. Two broadside-coupled microstrips are realized on the
top and bottom metallic layers and the coupling slot is etched
on the middle metallic layer. To design the diamond-shape cou-
pled line, the rectangular-shape equivalent structure shown in
Fig. 2(d) should be first designed and then equivalent to the di-
amond-shape counterpart with the same occupied areas.
Considering the structure shown in Fig. 2(d), the even- and
odd-mode impedances versus the slot width in the middle
layer and strip width in the top and bottom layers are ex-
tracted by Ansoft HFSS and plotted in Fig. 3. It reveals that
odd-mode impedance is mainly determined by the strip
width , and almost independent of the slot width . In ad-
dition, the odd-mode impedance can be easily synthesized
by conventional microstrip formulas [5], [6]. The even-mode
impedance and the coupling amount of broadside-coupled
strips can then be adjusted by varying the slot width .
For the Marchand balun design, a high impedance ratio be-
tween the and of the coupled line is critical to achieve
a well-designed balun and to broaden the operating bandwidth
[2]. In this letter, the and are selected as 211 and
31 , respectively. Hence, referred to Fig. 3, the corresponding
dimension parameters in Fig. 2(d) are determined as
, , and ( at the de-
sign frequency 2 GHz). The strip and slot areas of the equiv-
alent structure are achieved as
and .
As shown in Fig. 2(a), the strip and slot areas of the diamond-
shape slot-coupled microstrip can be calculated as

Therefore, as the is chosen and is set to , the and
can be obtained by letting and

. As finishing the design of the diamond-shape coupled mi-
crostrips, two sections of the coupled microstips are connected
to form the Marchand balun as shown in Fig. 2(a). Moreover,
according to Fig. 1, one terminal of the coupled microstrip is
kept open-circuited, and the other two terminals are short-cir-
cuited to the ground in the middle layer.
III. SIMULATED AND MEASURED RESULTS
Based on the design procedures in Section II, a 2 GHz Marc-
hand balun is designed and fabricated in a two-layered RO4003
substrate with a dielectric constant of 3.38 and a loss tangent of
0.0027. Each dielectric layer has a thickness of 0.508 mm.
The photographs of the developed balun are illustrated in Fig. 4.
It occupies a circuit size of 42.4 14 , and the dimension
parameters are , , ,
and . Hence, the angle of the diamond shape is
about 7 . The above-mention parameters are already fine tuned
to achieve optimal performance. Hence, by applying (1) and (2),
the calculated strip and slot areas are and
, which are approximately equal to the
and , respectively.
The simulated S-parameters shown in Fig. 5(a) are achieved
by 3-D full-wave simulator Ansoft HFSS. In addition, Fig. 5(a)
also presents the calculated results of the ideal Marchand balun
of Fig. 1 using circuit simulator Agilent ADS. The circuit con-
figuration of the ideal balun is constructed by two sections of
ideal coupled lines with the values of and
at 2 GHz. It is observed that the simulated results of the
developed balun have a matched performance to those of the
ideal Marchand balun. The measured results shown in Fig. 5(b)
are carried out by Anritsu 37347C, and are in a good agreement
with simulated results. The measured return loss is better than
10 dB from 1.11 GHz to 2.93 GHz with a 90% relative band-
width. Over this frequency range, the varies from
to , while changes from to .
The results shown in Fig. 5 demonstrate that the proposed cir-
cuit configuration in this letter is an effective structure to im-
plement a broadband Marchand balun. Obviously, the conver-
sion procedures of slot-coupled microstrip from the rectangular-
shape to the diamond-shape in Section II are also experimentally
verified.

A New Dual-Band Microstrip Bandpass
Filter Using Net-Type Resonators
Chao-Hsiung Tseng, Member, IEEE, and Hsin-Yung Shao
Abstract—In this letter, a new dual-band microstrip band-
pass filter is developed using net-type resonators. The net-type
resonator is designed to simultaneously operate at two closely
specified resonant frequencies,
 
and

, and then applied to
construct a dual-band filter based on the filter design concept
of adding extra coupled resonators. The dual-band filter with
the elliptic function response is designed, implemented and ex-
perimentally verified in this letter. The measured results of the
developed filter are in a good agreement with the simulated
results by full-wave electromagnetic simulator. In addition, the
developed filter not only has an excellent mid-band rejection, but
also provides a wide stopband suppression.
Index Terms—Daul-passband, microstrip filter, net-type res-
onator, stepped-impedance resonator (SIR).
I. INTRODUCTION
T HE dual-band bandpass filter (BPF) is a key componentfor realization of a dual-band wireless communication
system. Since the spurious responses of the stepped-impedance
resonator (SIR) [1], [2] can be flexibly controlled by the im-
pedances and electrical lengths of the cascaded transmission
lines, the SIRs are popularly employed to implement the planar
dual-band BPFs [3]–[8]. In [3]–[7], the SIRs shown in
Fig. 1(a-1) and (a-2) are employed to design dual-band filters
with two passbands at frequencies and . The
frequency ratio determines which type of SIRs (
or ) should be adopted.
For size reduction, the SIR shown in Fig. 1(b-1) was
evolved into the net-type resonator [9] depicted in Fig. 1(c-1)
and (d-1), and then exploited to design a single passband filter.
As shown in Fig. 2, by choosing SIRs with , the wide
stopband rejections are can be achieved in [9]. However, these
net-type resonators cannot be used to implement filters for dual-
band cell phone (0.9/1.8 GHz) or WLAN (2.45/5.7 GHz) appli-
cations.
In this letter, based on the design concept of adding extra cou-
pled resonator sections in [10], the dual-band net-type resonator
is developed, and then applied to implement a dual-band BPF

with the elliptic function response. Unlike the resonators in [9],
the net-type resonator in the region shown in Fig. 2 is de-
veloped to achieve two closely specified resonant frequencies.
The filter developed in this letter not only has two transmission

The filter is fabricated on a RO4003 substrate with a thick-
ness of 0.508 mm, a dielectric constant of 3.38, and a loss tan-
gent of 0.0027. The center frequencies of two passbands are set
to and . Substituting and into

culate the electrical length using (2). Here and
are chosen as 60 and 20 , respectively. The fractional band-
widths (FBWs) of first and second passbands are

cations of the filter, the element values of the low-pass proto-
type filter [11] are , , ,
, and . The coupling coeffi-
cients and external quality factors [11] are calculated as
, , , and
for 1 GHz, and , ,
, and for 2 GHz. The full-wave sim-
ulator Agilent Momentum is used to extract the above design
parameters ( and ) [11].
IV. SIMULATED AND MEASURED RESULTS
The dimension parameters of the developed filter have
been indicated in Fig. 4(b). The photograph of the devel-
oped filter is shown in Fig. 5(a). It occupies a circuit size
of . The simulated and measured results
are illustrated in Fig. 5(b), and their enlarged views of the
responses are given in Fig. 5(c). As expected, each passband
has a pair of transmission zeros to improve the selectivity.
The return losses in the two passbands are better than 12.6 dB
while the insertion losses are about 2.65 dB and 2.44 dB at the
first and second passbands, respectively. The insertion loss is
mainly contributed from the dielectric and conductor losses.
Although a number of vias are employed to design the net-type
resonator in this letter, the results reveal that it does not lead to
an increase of insertion loss. In addition, the mid-band rejection
between two passbands is greater than 40 dB from 1.14 GHz
to 1.75 GHz. It is because the open stub in the resonator 1 or
4 individually gives a transmission zero at around 1.5 GHz,
and then the coupling between resonators 1 and 4 makes two
transmission zeros split at 1.33 and 1.55 GHz. Fig. 6 shows
the measured wideband response of the developed filter. The
stopband rejection is better than 20 dB up to 5.6 GHz, namely
5.6 .
V. CONCLUSION
In this letter, a new net-type resonator is designed to simul-
taneously operate at two specified frequencies, and then ap-
plied to implement a dual-band microstrip BPF. The results in
Section IV demonstrate that the net-type resonator can be suc-
cessfully employed to implement a dual-band BPF. Although a
number of vias are adopted in the net-type resonator design, it
does not obviously lead to an additional insertion loss. More-
over, the developed filter has a good mid-band rejection and a
wide stopband suppression.

II. DUAL-BAND NET-TYPE RESONATORS 
To design the 4λ SIR with two close resonant frequencies, 
f1 and f2 ( 2 1 2f f ≈ ), the circuit structure shown in Fig. 1 (b-2) 
is adopted in this letter. It is comprised of two transmission 
lines with the equal electrical length θ  and the impedance 
ratio 2 1 1K Z Z= > . The high impedance ( 2Z ) line is kept 
open-circuited while the low impedance ( 1Z ) line is connected 
to the ground. Hence, the first two resonant frequencies f1 (f0) 
and f2 (fS1 ) of this 4λ  SIR can be related by [1],

transmission lines of the SIR have equal electrical length, θ  
indicated in Fig. 1 (b-2) can be expressed as [1], 
 1tan Kθ −=  (2) 
The low impedance line can be equivalent to three parallel-
connected stubs as shown in Fig. 1 (c-2). Since the electrical 
lengths of two sections of the SIR in Fig. 1 (a) are set to equal, 
the net-type resonator can be folded to a square box shape as 
shown in Fig. 1 (d-2). Note that neither the value of  K  
nor 2 1f f  is restricted to an integer.  
III. DESIGN OF DUAL-BAND FILTER 
Based on the design concept in [10], the coupling structure 
shown in Fig. 3 (a) is exploited to develop the dual-band filter 
with the elliptic response. The resonators 1 and 4 are designed 
to simultaneously operate at the center frequencies f1 and f2 of 
the 1st and 2nd passbands. The resonators 2I and 3I are 
designed to operate at f1 while the resonators 2
II and 3II are 
designed to operate at f2. In this letter, the resonators 1 and 4 
are realized by the folded net-type resonators shown in Fig. 1 
(d-2), while the resonators 2I, 3I, 2II, and 3II are implemented 
by the net-type folded resonators illustrated in Fig. 1 (d-1). 
The schematic layout of the dual-band bandpass filter is 
illustrated in Fig. 3 (b). 
The filter is fabricated on a RO4003 substrate with a 
thickness of 0.508 mm, a dielectric constant of 3.38, and a 
loss tangent of 0.0027. The center frequencies of two 
passbands are set to f1=1 GHz and f2=2 GHz. Substituting f1

 V. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, a new dual-band net-type resonator is 
designed to simultaneously operate at two specified 
frequencies. Incorporating with the single-band net-type 
resonators in [12], a dual-band net-type bandpass filter can be 
developed. The results in Section IV demonstrate that the net-
type resonator can be not only used to realize single-band 
bandpass filters in [12], but also successfully employed to 
implement a dual-band bandpass filter. The developed filter 
has an excellent mid-band rejection and a wide stopband 
suppression.

II. DESIGN OF CCS  DUAL-MODE BANDPASS FILTERS  
A. Complementary-Conducting Strip Transmission Line 
In this paper, the high-impedance (80 Ω) and low-
impedance (25 Ω) CCS TLs are employed to implement the 
millimeter-wave CMOS filters. The unit cells of these two 
CCS TLs are shown in Fig 2. They are fabricated using 
standard 0.18um CMOS 1P6M technology. The signal traces 
are realized on the thick metal layer M6 to reduce the 
conductor loss. For the high-impedance cell, the ground 
pattern is only put on M1. To increase shunt equivalent 
capacitance, the ground pattern of the low-impedance cell is 
realized on layers from M1 to M5 with connections by dense 
vias. For simplicity, two types of cells choose the same cell 
size, nemely P = 'P . The CCS cells are then connected to 
implement a 2-D meandered CCS TL as illustrated in insets of 
Fig 3. The S-parameters of the CCS TL are simulated by 
Ansoft HFSS, and then applied to extract the characteristic 
impedances and propagation constants [12].  Shown in Fig. 
3(a) are the characteristic impedances of the high- and low-
impedance CCS TLs. Except for the very low frequency band, 
the impedances of the developed CCS TLs are almost 
independent of frequency up to 110 GHz. In addition, since 
the deflected ground structure increases return current paths, it 
takes advantage to achieve slow-wave effects. Observed from 
Fig. 3(b), it shows that relative high slow-wave factors ( 0/ kβ ). 
This property can be adapted to develop compact passive 
components. On the other hand, the deflected ground structure 
of CCS TL does not lead to the obvious increase of 
attenuation constants. 
B. Type-I Filter Using Step Impedance Perturbations 
    As shown in Fig 1(a), a pair of step impedance sections are 
embedded in the diagonal positions of type-I filter. The 
characteristic impedance and electrical length of inserted low 
impedance line can control locations of transmission zeros.

IV. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, a novel compact bandpass filter using π-
equivalent transmission lines has been proposed and 
experimentally verified. The results in Section III 
demonstrate that the circuit design methodology in the paper 
is successfully employed to implement a bandpass filter with 
a 30 dB harmonic suppression up to 3.4 f0. In addition, as 
compared with the conventional structure, the circuit size of 
the developed filter is reduced to 54.7 %.The π-equivalent 
transmission line has the potential to apply in microwave 
filter and circuit designs with unwanted spurious signal 
suppression.

responses have dramatic changes at the corners of the

B. Oscillator design and measurement 
 
Based on the circuit configuration shown in Fig. 1, an 
oscillator is designed using stub bandpass filter, and 
fabricated on a RO4003 substrate as shown in Fig. 5. Here, 
for simplicity, the amplifier is realized by a junction field-
effect transistor (NE3514S02 JFET) which is biased at 2-V 
VDS and 10-mA IDS. According to the “ Barkhausen criteria ” 
[7], the total loop phase of oscillator should be 360°. The 
simulated phase responses of the developed filter including 
the connecting lines are plotted in Fig. 6. The transmission

phase responses of the FET are also given. Summing two 
phase responses, one can achieve the total loop phase of the 
oscillator. By properly adjusting the length of the connecting 
line, one can design the loop phase approaching to 360° at 
the frequency 2.006 GHz which also has a peak value of the 
group delay response (the left-hand side peak in Fig. 4). Fig. 
7(a) shows the measured spectrum near the oscillating 
frequency. It is carried out by Agilent Spectrum Analyzer 
N9010A with the settings of a 100 kHz resolution bandwidth 
and 10 MHz frequency span. The output power is 4.21 dBm 
at the oscillating frequency 1.99 GHz, which is near the 
frequency of the left-hand-side peak value in Fig. 4. As 
shown in Fig. 7(b), the phase noises of the developed 
oscillator are -105 dBc/Hz and -132 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz and 1 
MHz offset frequencies, respectively. The developed filter-
based oscillator gives a reasonable phase noise performance 
using the stub filter without transmission zeros. 
III. OSCILLATOR DESIGN  USING TRISECTION FILTER 
A. Development of  trisection filter 
 
The trisection filter provides a transmission zero near the 
passband. As the cross coupling is positive, the transmission 
zero will be on the low-frequency side. On the other hand, as

amplifier is realized by Mini-Circuits Gali-2 MMIC 
Amplifier, which biased at 12 V with a 41-mA bias current. 
Based on the design procedures in Sec. II-B, the oscillator is 
designed with 2.466 GHz oscillating frequency, which is near 
the frequency of peak value in Fig. 10. Fig .11 (a) shows the 
measurement spectrum carried out by Agilent Spectrum 
Analyzer N9030A with the settings of a 100 kHz resolution 
bandwidth and a 10 MHz frequency span. The output power 
is 7.69 dBm. As shown in Fig. 11(b), the phase noises of the 
developed oscillator are -125.7 dBc/Hz and -138.4 dBc/Hz at 
100 kHz and 1 MHz offset frequencies, respectively. Table II 
compares the circuit performances of this work and published 
microwave oscillators. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, two microwave oscillators are developed

oscillating frequency is designed at the frequency with a high 
group delay, the oscillator will have a low phase noise 
performance. Table II shows that the oscillator using the 
trisection filter has a better phase noise performance than that 
using the stub filter. It is because a higher group delay is

provided by the trisection filter. Although the stub filter does 
not have any transmission zero, it can still be used to design a 
microwave oscillator with a reasonable phase noise 
performance.

 bandpass filter based on the design concept of adding extra 
coupled resonator sections in [12]. The developed filter not 
only has a pair of transmission zeros to improve the selectivity 
of each passband, but also provides a wide stopband 
suppression and an excellent mid-band rejection between two 
passbands. 
II. DUAL-BAND NET-TYPE RESONATORS 
To design the 4λ SIR with two close resonant frequencies, 
f1 and f2 ( 2 1 2f f ≈ ), the circuit structure shown in Fig. 1 (b-2) 
is adopted in this letter. It is comprised of two transmission 
lines with the equal electrical length θ  and the impedance 
ratio 2 1 1K Z Z= > . The high impedance ( 2Z ) line is kept 
open-circuited while the low impedance ( 1Z ) line is connected 
to the ground. Hence, the first two resonant frequencies f1 (f0) 
and f2 (fS1 ) of this 4λ  SIR can be related by [1],

−= −  (1) 
where K  is the impedance ratio 2 1Z Z . As two cascaded 
transmission lines of the SIR have equal electrical length, θ  
indicated in Fig. 1 (b-2) can be expressed as [1], 
 1tan Kθ −=  (2) 
The low impedance line can be equivalent to three parallel-
connected stubs as shown in Fig. 1 (c-2). Since the electrical 
lengths of two sections of the SIR in Fig. 1 (a) are set to equal, 
the net-type resonator can be folded to a square box shape as 
shown in Fig. 1 (d-2). Note that neither the value of  K  
nor 2 1f f  is restricted to an integer.  
III. DESIGN OF DUAL-BAND FILTER 
Based on the design concept in [10], the coupling structure 
shown in Fig. 3 (a) is exploited to develop the dual-band filter 
with the elliptic response. The resonators 1 and 4 are designed 
to simultaneously operate at the center frequencies f1 and f2 of 
the 1st and 2nd passbands. The resonators 2I and 3I are 
designed to operate at f1 while the resonators 2
II and 3II are 
designed to operate at f2. In this letter, the resonators 1 and 4 
are realized by the folded net-type resonators shown in Fig. 1 
(d-2), while the resonators 2I, 3I, 2II, and 3II are implemented 
by the net-type folded resonators illustrated in Fig. 1 (d-1). 
The schematic layout of the dual-band bandpass filter is 
illustrated in Fig. 3 (b). 
The filter is fabricated on a RO4003 substrate with a 
thickness of 0.508 mm, a dielectric constant of 3.38, and a 
loss tangent of 0.0027. The center frequencies of two 
passbands are set to f1=1 GHz and f2=2 GHz. Substituting f1

 V. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, a new dual-band net-type resonator is 
designed to simultaneously operate at two specified 
frequencies. Incorporating with the single-band net-type 
resonators in [12], a dual-band net-type bandpass filter can be 
developed. The results in Section IV demonstrate that the net-
type resonator can be not only used to realize single-band 
bandpass filters in [12], but also successfully employed to 
implement a dual-band bandpass filter. The developed filter 
has an excellent mid-band rejection and a wide stopband 
suppression.

II. DESIGN OF CCS  DUAL-MODE BANDPASS FILTERS  
A. Complementary-Conducting Strip Transmission Line 
In this paper, the high-impedance (80 Ω) and low-
impedance (25 Ω) CCS TLs are employed to implement the 
millimeter-wave CMOS filters. The unit cells of these two 
CCS TLs are shown in Fig 2. They are fabricated using 
standard 0.18um CMOS 1P6M technology. The signal traces 
are realized on the thick metal layer M6 to reduce the 
conductor loss. For the high-impedance cell, the ground 
pattern is only put on M1. To increase shunt equivalent 
capacitance, the ground pattern of the low-impedance cell is 
realized on layers from M1 to M5 with connections by dense 
vias. For simplicity, two types of cells choose the same cell 
size, nemely P = 'P . The CCS cells are then connected to 
implement a 2-D meandered CCS TL as illustrated in insets of 
Fig 3. The S-parameters of the CCS TL are simulated by 
Ansoft HFSS, and then applied to extract the characteristic 
impedances and propagation constants [12].  Shown in Fig. 
3(a) are the characteristic impedances of the high- and low-
impedance CCS TLs. Except for the very low frequency band, 
the impedances of the developed CCS TLs are almost 
independent of frequency up to 110 GHz. In addition, since 
the deflected ground structure increases return current paths, it 
takes advantage to achieve slow-wave effects. Observed from 
Fig. 3(b), it shows that relative high slow-wave factors ( 0/ kβ ). 
This property can be adapted to develop compact passive 
components. On the other hand, the deflected ground structure 
of CCS TL does not lead to the obvious increase of 
attenuation constants. 
B. Type-I Filter Using Step Impedance Perturbations 
    As shown in Fig 1(a), a pair of step impedance sections are 
embedded in the diagonal positions of type-I filter. The 
characteristic impedance and electrical length of inserted low 
impedance line can control locations of transmission zeros. 
Shown in Fig. 4 (a-1) and (b-1) are the even and odd-mode 
 
Fig. 3. (a) characteristic impedances and (b) normalized propagation 
constants of high- and low-impedance CCS-TLs.
