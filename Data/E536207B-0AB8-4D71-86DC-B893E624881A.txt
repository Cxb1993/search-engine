surface[6] on the secondary flow pattern within turbulent Poiseuille duct flows. However, little
is known about the effect of moving wall on the secondary flow structure at high Couette veloc-
ity. Therefore, the present study aims at obtaining a detailed description of turbulence structures
of Poiseuille and Couette flows inside square duct using direct numerical simulations.
2 Numerical method
We consider fully developed, incompressible turbulent flow in a channel or duct. The founda-
mental equations are the continuity equation and three-dimensional, time-dependent Navier-
Stokes equations which can be expressed as following.

∂xj
= 0 (1)

)] (2)
Here, i=1,2 and 3 represent the spanwise, wall-normal and streamwise directions, respectively.
In order to capture the small scale energy near the wall, the clustered grid with hyperbolic tan-
gent function in the wall-normal direction and uniform grid is adopted in the homogeneous
direction.
In the present study, the four-step fractional step method proposed by Choi and Moin [10] is
adopted for the computational algorithm. The viscous terms are treated by the semi-implicit
scheme: Crank-Nicholson and the other terms are treated by Adams-Bashforth with time ad-
vancement. The spatial discretization is based on the finite volume method on a staggered
mesh. The grid resolution of channel is similar to that of Abe et al.[8]. The domain of
channel is (piδ × 2δ × 2piδ) in the spanwise, wall-normal and streamwise directions respec-
tively. Computational grid points are 128x128x128, and its resolution of each direction are
∆x+ = 4.4178, ∆y+ = 0.2159 ∼ 5.9195 and ∆z+ = 8.8357 at a Reynolds number of 360
based on the mean friction velocity and height of channel. Although the computational domain
of square duct is ,(δ × δ × 2piδ), smaller than that of channel flow, the grid resolutions, i.e.
∆x+ = 0.2159 ∼ 5.9195, ∆y+ = 0.2159 ∼ 5.9195 and ∆z+ = 8.8357 with 128x128x256 grid
points, are the same in the simulation.
Parallelization of the code is performed by a domain decomposition along the streamwise di-
rection due to explicit numerical treatment on that direction. Message-passing programing and
the sactter, gather and sendreceive statements of Message-Passing Interface(MPI) libaray are
adopted for communication between the processors. In the present study, due to the periodic
boundary condition, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) mehod can be implemented to reduce
3-D Possion equation to uncoupled 2-D algebraic equations. The algebraic equation can be
solved by the direct solver LU to converge solution with only one iteration at each time step.
However, this algorithm is difficult to parallelize because it requires the global information of
the flow in the periodic direction. Therefore, the simulation is executed on the IBM cluster 1350
(512 node) with about 67 percent efficiency when 32 CPUS are employed.
3 Results
The basic flow parameters are summarized in Table 1, where PP stands for plane Poiseuille
flow, PC is plane Couette flow, DP is square duct Poiseuille flow and DC is square duct Couette
flow. Reynolds numbers based on the bulk velocity are ranging from 5400 to 6400. Mean steam-
wise velocity distributions from the top wall along the wall bisector, i.e. x/D = 0.5, are shown
in Fig. 1 compared with DNS data [8, 9]. For flows PP and DP, the velocity distributions are

turbulence intensity distributions along the wall bisector are resemble to the DNS data of plane
channel flows of Moser [7] and Abe et al.[8] for DP case. However, except in the very near
wall region, turbulent intensity distributions of the duct Couette flow and plane Couette wall are
different. It seems to be the result of the sweep motion which is responsible for enhancement of
the near wall turbulence. The results show that the sweep motion is responsible for enhancement
of the near wall turbulence around 13% along the wall bisector.
