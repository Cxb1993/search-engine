 
 
The conveyor systems of the glass substrate become 
more and more complex due to the increase of the 
dimension and weight of the glass substrate. The 
conveyor systems of the glass substrate contain 
horizontal linear conveyor, horizontal rotational 
conveyor and vertical lifting system. The horizontal 
linear conveyors are driven by roller generally and can 
be supported by air bearing in the new generation. The 
horizontal rotational conveyor rotates the glass 
substrates. The vertical lifting systems serve to load the 
glass substrate in and out the cassette, which works as 
buffer of glass substrate in the process. This paper aims 
to investigate the lifting positioning system with 
pneumatic-balanced system. In the new generation of 
glass substrates, the weight variation between no-load 
and full-load conditions of the lifting system can reach 
from 200 kgf to 1000 kgf. The large loading variation 
results in the demand of larger power of the AC servo 
motor for positioning. Instead of that, the loading 
variation can be counter-balanced by the pneumatic 
cylinders of the pneumatic-balanced system such that 
the AC servo motor needs only smaller power without 
adding the inertial mass. Besides, in order to achieve 
jerk-free motion, path-positioning control, that contains 
path tracking control in the motion process and 
positioning control at the target end position, is 
developed in this paper. For that, adaptive sliding mode 
control is used to develop the controller.

TESTRIG LAYOUT 
 
The test rig of the active pneumatic-balanced lifting 
positioning system for the new generation TFT-LCD 
glass substrate consists of the pneumatic-balanced 
controlled system, which contains two rodless 
pneumatic cylinders with pressure control servo valves, 
and a positioning control system driven by an AC servo 
motor with belt transmission mechanism that serves as 
position control of the lifting system. The 
pneumatic-balanced controlled system serves to balance 
actively the weight of the loading and the lifting table.

Item Specifications 
Control type Path-positioning 
Glass substrate dimension 1950 X 2250mm

Weight of no-loading 200kgf 
Stroke of Z-axis 1100mm 
Velocity  40m/min

A PC-based control system is used to implement the 
positioning control and the pneumatic-balanced control. 
Figure 1 photographically shows the layout of the test 
rig. Figure 2 schematically illustrates the concept of the 
proposed pneumatic-balanced lifting positioning system. 
The pneumatic balanced control system works firstly to 
keep the resultant weight constant, which means the 
weight of loading minus the counter-balanced force 
form the pneumatic cylinders is constant. Pressure 
sensors are used to measure the pneumatic pressure p 
and calculate the pneumatic balanced force Fpneu by 
   
where A indicates the effective piston area of pneumatic 
cylinder; n is the cylinder number. The positioning 
control system driven by an AC servo motor is 
measured by a position sensor. Table 2 specifies the 
required performance.

The above properties of the boundary layer concept are 
 
to be exploited, in the design of AFSMC, our goal being 
to cease adaptation as soon as the boundary layer is 
reached. This approach aims to avoid the possibility of 
unbounded growth. Differentiating (9) along the system

the feasibility and the repeatability can be confirmed. 
By means of the pneumatic-balanced control, the lifting 
positioning system driven by an AC servo motor can 
almost neglect the wide variation of the loading and 
achieve high position performance.

 二、與會心得 
詳細分析論文發表之國家，亞洲國家之發表主要來自日本、台灣、韓國及中國大陸，也
可看出其積極發展再生能源之方向，以中國為例，近三年來積極發展風力發電，三年期
間從無到有，全世界前十名風機製造商，中國就佔了 3 席，令人刮目相看。同時利用此
次機會，也進行亞洲再生能源學術界交流，同時兩岸再生能源學術界學界也彼此交流，
交換研究成果及經驗，並尋求未來研究合作之可能性。 
 
三、考察參觀活動(無此項活動者省略) 
無 
 
四、建議 
 
再生能源為國際間為節能減碳正積極發展之新興領域，反觀國內，台灣每人平均排 CO2
量名列前茅，發展再生能源實在是迫在眉睫，然而，綜觀國際間發展再生能源之國家可
發現，最關鍵之因素是政府政策，再生能源研討會中，總會有”政策(Policy)”場次，國內
再生能源之發展同樣地需要政府政策之支持，發展節淨能源。
