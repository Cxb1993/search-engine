一、中文摘要 
本研究內容為利用非熱電漿與熱電
漿改質修飾光觸媒，獲得適用於發光二極
體(Light emitting diode, LED)下之空氣污
染物降解之反應系統，同時進行改質複合
光觸媒特性分析。分為光催化反應之電漿
改質光觸媒合成與室內有機污染物結合
LED 光催化分解反應(目標污染物則選用
甲苯)兩部份。第一部分係以電漿修飾含氮
光觸媒。分別使用高週波電漿（ radio 
frequency (RF) plasma ） 與 電 漿 火 炬
（plasma torch, PT）進行含氮光觸媒修
飾。第二部分進而探討以不同光源，紫外
線發光二極體（ultraviolet light emitting 
diode, UVLED (383 nm)）、白光發光二極
體（ white light emitting diode, WLED 
(440-640 nm)）、日光燈管 (visible light 
lamp, VLL)置於反應器中央作為激發光
源，在不同操作控制因子，如光觸媒鍛燒
方式、鍛燒溫度與濃度下，進行甲苯異相
光催化分解反應的探討，利用 WLED 光降
解不同初始濃度之初始反應速率值，建立
甲苯光催化分解之反應動力式並作數值
模擬。 
結果顯示RF電漿鍛燒方式能有效提
升光觸媒比表面積(BET surface area)。PT
則使BET降低。經由RF電漿鍛燒之光觸媒
的含氮量亦高於高溫爐(muffle furnace, 
MF)鍛燒之光觸媒，也高於PT鍛燒。在酸
性環境下，MF鍛燒溫度400℃之光觸媒
(TiNxO2-xMF400)於pH 2.5時有最小的水合
粒徑80 nm，顯示(TiNxO2-xMF400)受到pH
值的影響顯著，RF鍛燒溫度450℃之光觸
媒(TiNxO2-xRF450)於酸性環境下，其水合
粒徑也明顯縮小。RF與電PT鍛燒之光觸
媒，於WLED光源下處理甲苯的效率優於
商 用 TiO2 。 光 催 化 反 應 動 力 可 以
L-H(Langmuir-Hinshelwood)模式模擬。於
TiNxO2-xRF450光催化下反應動力模擬與
實驗數值趨近，而在PT鍛燒溫度300℃
(TiNxO2-xPT300)之光催化模擬，於高濃度
時數值偏低，模擬濃度與實驗數值差距較
大。本研究可做為設計可見光光催化技術
之參考。 
關鍵詞：甲苯、發光二極體、室內污染物、
可見光光催化、高週波電漿、電漿火炬、
含氮光觸媒。 
 
Abstract 
This study investigated the feasibility of 
the applications of the plasma surface 
modification of photocatalysts and the 
removal of volatile organic compounds 
(VOCs) from indoor pollution source. 
Toluene was taken as a model compound. 
The N doped TiO2 were prepared by 
precipitation methods, then calcined by 
using muffle furnace (MF), radio frequency 
(RF) plasma and plasma torch (PT) at 
different temperatures with the light sources 
of white lighting emitting diode (WLED), 
ultraviolet light emitting diode (UVLED) 
and visible light lamp (VLL). The operation 
parameters and influential factors, such as 
calcined temperatures, concentrations of 
 3 
膜，能有效植入氮元素，並能提升熱穩定
性。Dholam et al. (2009)分別以高週波電磁
濺鍍(radio frequency magnetron sputtering)
和 溶 膠 凝 膠 (sol-gel) 法 合 成 Cr 或
Fe/TiO2，進行產氫的實驗，結果顯示濺鍍
製成的 TiO2比起 sol-gel 法製備的 TiO2更
能使吸光光譜紅移。Chen et al. (2007)利用
輝光雙電極放電之大氣電漿製備光觸
媒，發現在 TTIP(Ti(OC3H7)4)及水蒸氣為
前趨物下，以 O2/Ar 電漿環境合成含氮
TiO2 (O-x-Ti-N-y 及-(NO))光觸媒，對 IPA 
(isopropyl alcohol)在可見光及紫外光下活
性均比純 TiO2高。Zou and Liu (2006)使
用輝光放電冷電漿做初濕含浸法製成的
NiO/SrTiO3 光觸媒的修飾，使用 Ni(NO3)
使其形成 NiO 後，可以增進金屬的延散性
及穩定度，增加的延散性可以改進半導體
內電子的傳遞，增加活性基，可以增加裂
解乙醇溶液產氫量達 1.3 至 1.8 倍。更進
一步的，Zou et al. (2007) 更利用輝光放電
冷電漿合成 Pt/TiO2 光觸媒，同樣在產氫
活性上有極大的增進效果，主因是電漿可
以增進金屬與載體的交互作用，增加扭曲
表面及金屬延散性與穩定性。Chen et al. 
(2006) 利用電漿濺鍍法將 TiO2 (P25)混合
ZnO/CeO2/SnO2 粉末分別沉積在發泡鋁材
料上，並以苯降解測試其活性，從 X 光光
電子能譜(x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, 
XPS）檢測分析得知，晶型觀察是銳鈦礦
及金紅石相的混合，氧元素依據組合不同
分別為結晶態氧、氫氧態氧及物理吸收態
氧，混合 10% CeO2 及 10%SnO2 的 TiO2
活性相當，但均比混合 10% ZnO 效果還
好。Iriyama et al. (2006) 利用低溫 H2O 電
漿三步驟處理銀粒子而加上含氮官能
基，使得 Ag 表面形成親水性並增加延散
性，此銀粒子可應用在導電黏著劑及很多
官能基粉末上。Jung et al. (2007) 利用
sol-gel 法以 Ti(OCH(CH3)2)為前趨物製造
出 TiO2後，利用 300W O2及 Ar 微波電漿
製造 TiO2薄膜，檢測結果發現有超親水特
性及光滑表面晶型結構，而且 O2 電漿比
Ar 電漿有更好的效果。 
一般奈米粒子之製備方式可分為氣
相凝結法、機械合金法及化學溶液合成法
三類。本研究以化學溶液合成法為主，輔
以氣相熱凝結處理修飾，並針對室內常見
的空氣污染物甲苯，利用 LED 搭配電漿
改質可見光光觸媒，進行操作因子對揮發
性有機物甲苯去除的影響實驗。期望電漿
改質光觸媒能有效提升光觸媒的物化特
性。並結合安全性高、壽命長(10 萬小時
以上，為一般燈泡 25~100 倍)、輕巧攜帶
容易(平面封裝，多顆組合)、造價便宜、
省電效率高、低壓直流電驅動、發熱量
少、耐震與耐衝擊、單色光發光、反應速
率快及無汞污染的 LED 取代傳統日光燈
管，期待發展出高效率之 LED 光催化技
術及更為大眾所接受之空氣清淨技術。進
而降低傳統水銀燈管的無效電力，減少發
電所需之二氧化碳排放量，並減少有害廢
棄水銀燈管廢棄水銀的處理問題。 
 
三、研究方法 
(一) 材料與設備 
 
1. 甲苯 (toluene) 
本研究使用甲苯  (Nihon Shiyaka 
Industries, Ltd., Ind. Co., Ltd., Japan, 99.7 
%)作為目標室內空氣污染物。配製方法為
取定量之甲苯加入 1 L 密閉之反應槽內，
加熱至 40 ℃使之完全揮發，在不同濃度
下進行光催化反應。 
 
2. 觸媒之製備 
本研究選擇製備的含氮 TiO2，依鍛燒
方式及溫度的不同而進行命名，如 Table 1
所示。鍛燒方式有高溫爐(muffle furnace, 
MF)、高週波電漿(radio frequency, RF)及電
漿火炬(plasma torch, PT)，溫度介於 300
至 450℃間。 
 
Table 1. Photocatalysts at different calcinations methods and 
temperatures 
 
製備方法，舉例來說，TiNxO2-xMF400
之製備方式，第一步驟係採用化學沉澱法
(precipitation method)製作，首先將定量之
Ti(SO4)2 (20 wt.%)置入燒杯中，緩慢加入
純度為 28%之 NH3 溶液使其水解，並調

作為光源。反應進行時使用磁石攪拌及氣
密氣體循環幫浦以使反應氣體於反應槽
內完全混和均勻，並使反應物與觸媒充分
接觸以利光催化反應進行。為避免溫度變
化干擾實驗結果，全程利用恆溫水槽 
(Model-B403, First Scienrific, Taiwan)將反
應溫度控制在 25 ℃。反應過程中反應槽
以不透光之鋁箔紙包覆，以防其他光源之
干擾並防止紫外光外洩傷害人體。

(二) 實驗流程 
本實驗之甲苯濃度係以環檢所公告
之採樣袋採樣之氣相層析法（ NIEA 
A722.71B）配製，其操作程序如下：首先
先通入乾燥之空氣（O2 : N2 = 20 : 80）30 
min 以排除其他氣體，並使反應槽呈現乾
燥狀態。注入目標污染物甲苯，送進烘箱
加熱至 40 ℃使甲苯完全揮發，此時甲苯
實際濃度應等於理論濃度。當反應物完全
揮發後，將反應槽放置於恒溫水槽內，當
反應槽內之溫度維持為 25 ℃時，即可開
始採樣，而此點即為反應槽之初始濃度。
此時便可開啟光源（UVLED、VLL、
WLED），反應過程中監控溫度變化並採樣
分析甲苯濃度。甲苯之檢測以氣相層析質
譜儀(GC/MS, Focus GC and DSQ, USA) 
分析。 
四、結果與討論 
(一) 觸媒特性分析結果 
1. 比表面積分析 ( BET analysis ) 
  BET分析結果如Table 2所示。依BET
面 積 大 小 分 別 TiNxO2-xRF350 > 
TiNxO2-xRF400 > TiNxO2-xRF450> 
TiNxO2-xMF400 > TiNxO2-xPT300 > 
TiNxO2-xPT450。最大 BET 面積為 273.1 
m2g-1 (TiNxO2-xRF350)，最小為 35.3 m2g-1 
(TiNxO2-xPT450)。因此可知，經 RF 電漿
鍛燒之光觸媒能有效提升 BET 比表面
積，而經由電漿火炬鍛燒之光觸媒 BET
面積略有減損。主要為 RF 屬於低溫電
漿，其高溫電子、離子與觸媒分子作用
後，藉由能量轉移而增加觸媒分子的分散
性，進而使表面原子數增多。孔隙表面亦
跟著增加所致。而 PT 中心溫度高達上萬
度，屬於高溫電漿，因此藉由輻射能進行
的觸媒改質可能造成觸媒的燒結，降低分
散性而造成團聚所致。

TiNxO2-xPT300 94.9 20.9 90.9

2. 元素分析 ( elemental analysis ) 
元素分析結果如 Table 3 所示。光觸
媒含氮量大小依序為 TiNxO2-xRF350 > 
TiNxO2-xRF400 > TiNxO2-xRF450> 
TiNxO2-xMF400 > TiNxO2-xMF400A > 
TiNxO2-xMF400B > TiNxO2-xPT300 > 
TiNxO2-xPT450。經由 RF 電漿鍛燒之光觸
媒的含氮量高於 MF 及 PT，推測因 RF 電
漿使用氮氣作為工作氣體，氮原子在高能
量情況下打入光觸媒之中提升光觸媒含
氮量。而 PT 鍛燒之光觸媒含氮量低於 MF
鍛燒之光觸媒，推測因為電漿火炬的反應
區中溫度變化過高，導致含氮量降低。隨
溫度昇高，含氮量有降低的趨勢。含氮量
最高為 1.8 wt.% (TiNxO2-xRF350)，最低為
0.12 wt.% (TiNxO2-xPT450)。RF 電漿平均
含氮量(1.56 wt.%) 比 MF (0.26 wt.%)高 6
倍，比 PT (0.14 wt.%)高 11.14 倍。另外

3. TiNxO2-xPT450 於不同光源下光降解之
比較 
Fig. 6 為 TiNxO2-xPT450 在 WLED、
UVLED、VLL 下光降解甲苯的比較結
果。與在 TiNxO2-xRF450 進行光降解的結
果相似，VLL 的效果仍比 UVLED 和
WLED 好。由 Fig. 4 結果來看，相同鍛燒
溫度下，RF 電漿表現優於 PT，顯示光觸
媒鍛燒相同下，以選擇 RF 電漿進行光催
化效果較為良好。

比較 
Fig. 7 為 TiNxO2-xPT300 在 WLED、
UVLED、VLL 下光降解甲苯的比較結
果。同樣因 VLL 可見光燈管光強度遠大
於 UVLED 與 WLED，結果呈現 VLL > 
UVLED > WLED。由 Figs. 6 和 7 比較，
TiNxO2-x 以同樣 PT 鍛燒且於不同溫度
下，TiNxO2-xPT300 進行甲苯光降解反應優
於 TiNxO2-xPT450。顯示 PT 鍛燒溫度以較
低溫方式進行的電漿改質光觸媒光催化
效果較為優良。

5. 動力學模擬 
為了解甲苯濃度與反應速率之關係，
故本實驗以 Langmuir 吸附等溫線推導出
來之動力學模式 Langmuir-Hinshelwood 
model (L-H model) (1)來模擬反應速率與
反應物濃度之關係，如下式所示：

CkKCk

式中 kobs：假一階速率常數 (min-1)；k：反
應速率常數 (ppmv min-1)；KL：吸附平衡
常數  (ppmv-1) ； Co ：甲苯 初始濃 度 
(ppmv)；ro：初始反應速率 (ppmv min-1)。 
於不同初始濃度及不同光觸媒下，光
催化降解甲苯之實驗結果以假一階反應
式(pseudo first–order rate reaction)可先求
得初始反應速率 r0(如Table 6)，接著以 1/ r0
對 1/C0 做 圖 ， 由 斜 率 及 截 距 可 得
Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) 模式之反應
速率常數(k)以及吸附平衡常數(KL)。k 以
及 KL數值如 Table 7 所示。由 Table 6 可
知，在 WLED 光源下，較低濃度有較低的
初始反應速率(r0)，而以 TiNxO2-xRF450 為
例 ， 在 509 ppmv 時 有 最 大 值 。
TiNxO2-xPT300 時，在 350 ppmv 有最大
值。考慮所有光源下，以 TiNxO2-xPT450
於 VLL 下，於 349 ppmv 時的值 4.0614 
ppmv min-1 最 大 。 Table 7 顯 示
TiNxO2-xRF450 其 k 大於 TiNxO2-xPT300，
但 其 KL 則 TiNxO2-xPT300 遠 大 於
TiNxO2-xRF450，TiNxO2-xRF450 其 k 值約
為 TiNxO2-xPT300 的 2.6 倍，TiNxO2-xPT300
其 KL值約為 TiNxO2-xRF450 的 5.5 倍。整
體顯示 TiNxO2-xPT300 光催化效果優於
TiNxO2-xRF450。

電漿改質光觸媒結合不同 LED 光源之實
驗數據及動力模擬，並提出相關之模式，
這些模式有助於未來設計與操作最適
化，並提供一個經濟、有效的規劃設計方
法。未來將持續將研究成果做推廣及發

出國報告內容包括下列各項：
一、 參加會議經過
本人於五月十八日搭乘中華航空CI835班機至泰國曼谷機場，參與2009年第三
屆國際全球再生能源研討會 (World Renewable Energy Congress 2009,
WREC)，舉行時間從五月十九至五月二十二日，會期為期四天。會議結束後，五
月二十三日搭乘中華航空CI836班機直飛回台北。
會議從五月十九日開始，研討會第一天主要是熟悉報告會場及展覽的場地。
本屆WREC研討會主要以再生能源發展趨勢為大會主題，分成六個主題(topic)，分
別為生質能源(Bioenergy)、太陽能(Solar energy)、風能 (Wind power)、能源效率
評估之依據。評估之熱處理設備有四種，分別為1) 高週波電漿（Radio-frequency
plasma systems, RFPS）；2) 微波誘發裂解（Microwave-induced systems, MWS）；
3) 下抽式氣化爐（Downdraft gasifier systems, DGS）及電漿火炬（Plasma torch
systems, PTS）。能量分析項目包含廢稻稈的收集、運輸、乾燥、破碎、製成衍生
燃料碇(Refused-derived fuel, RDF)、熱處理設備、氣體凝結設備及空氣污染設備
等。廢稻稈熱處理後的主要產物有合成氣（syngas, CO+H2）、甲烷、二氧化碳及
含碳固體之殘渣。假設此座再生能源工廠的年運轉時數為8,000小時，年處理廢稻
稈評估量分別介於50,000至200,000公噸。運輸半徑則介於50至100公里，並同時評

1. INTRODUCTION
A renewable bio-fuel or bio-energy economy is projected as a pathway to reduce reliance
on fossil fuels, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and enhance rural economies.
Determining whether alternative fuels provide benefits over the fossil fuels they displace
requires through accounting of the direct and indirect inputs and outputs for their full
production and use life cycles. To be a viable substitute for fossil fuel, an alternative fuel
should have greater environmental benefits over the fossil fuel it displaces, be
economically competitive and be producible in sufficient quantities on energy demands,
and it should also a net energy obtain over the energy sources used to produce it. Biomass
waste is growing trend to account it as a source of resources and energy now. Wood,
crops, and agricultural and forestry residues are some of the main renewable energy
resources available [1]. Biomass fuels are most commonly used for central heating of
homes and larger facilities. Wood and its byproducts can also be converted into biofuels
such as syngas, methane, methanol or ethanol fuels [2]. “First-generation biofuels”are
biofuels made from sugar (sugar cane, sugar beet, or sweet sorghum), starch(corn or
wheat), vegetable oil (oil palm, soybean, algae, jatropha, sunflower seeds), or animal fats
using conventional technology. The feedstocks for the production of first generation
biofuels could go into the animal or human food chain, and as global population has risen
now. Using food to produce biofuels has been criticized because they cannot divert food
away from the human food chain, it will lead food shortages and price rises. “Second-
generation biofuels”can help solve the 1stgeneration biofuels’problems and can supply a
larger amount of fuel to provide sustainably, affordably and with greater environmental
benefits. The 2nd generation biofuel can expand the amount of biofuel that can be
produced sustainably by using biomass consisting of the residual non-food parts of crops,
such as stems, leaves and husks that are left behind the food crop has been obtained, as
well as other crops that are not used for food purposes, such as switch grass and jatropha,
and also industry waste such as wood chips, skins and pulp from fruit pressing, etc. [3].
Life cycle assessment (LCA) peruses the environmental aspects and potential impacts
throughout a product’s life, from raw material acquirement through production, use and
disposal [4]. LCA is a cradle‐to‐grave analysis for the energy and environmental
impacts of making a product. Energy life cycle analysis (ELCA) provides a tool to
quantify the total energy from different sources and the overall energy efficiency of
processes [5]. Direct (petroleum products, electricity) and indirect (used for production of
materials and equipments) energy consumption is evaluated in fuel life cycle. Energy
balance involves accounting for the amount of energies used in the production and
comparing it to the amount of energy contained in the resulting biofuel [6]. The result
obtained from the energy balance analysis (EBA) can be expressed as the net energy ratio
(NER), which is defined as the total energy produced by the system divided by the total
energy consumed by the system [6-7]. There are several ways of the NER can be derived.
The final result can be arbitrarily different depending on how the NER was defined. Also,
the ratio of energy produced to energy consumed by an energy production technology—
known as the energy return on investment (EROI)—is an important indicator of the
potential benefits to society. EROI is a productivity index. It is defined as the ratio of
gross energy produced by an energy supply process to the total, direct plus indirect,

2.2 Life-cycle processing and scenario conditions
The ELCA includes energy inputs for rice straw collection, transportation, torrefaction,
crushing, briquetting, energy production, condensation, air pollution control and
distribution of biofuels to its point of end use. Both on-farm and off‐farm labor, as well
as the energies used for collecting agricultural equipments and constructing buildings,
were included within the system boundary. Figure 1 shows the conceptual model of life-
cycle assessment of reuse of rice straw as bio-energy in this study. Three pre-treatment
equipments are used in series, including dryer, protable crusher (PC) and pelletizer. Four
alternative energy production processes, which are radio-frequency plasma systems
2.3 Energy analysis indicators
Net energy analysis ( NEA ) of a system is an accounting of all the energy inputs and
salable energy products in a way that even the energy required to build the system is
included as a energy investment. In other words, a complete NEA is not simply an input
and output energy balance. The question now arises as to just how much net energy a
system can deliver to market. Many specialists perceived that since energy units are
specifically defined and unlike monetary units, are not a function of such variables as
time, markets, living standards and public policies. Net energy analyses (NEAs) are more
scientific, precise, and indicative of the real value and energy-producing capabilities of a
system [21].
Three energy indicators were used in this study. The EROI ratio of the energy is delivered
by a process to the energy used directly and indirectly in that process. EROI is defined
as:
EROI = EP / EX, non-renewable
(1)
where EP ＝ sum of energy contents of products
EX, non-renewable ＝ sum of energy values of external energy inputs except
feedstock
Net energy production ratio (NER) indicates how much energy is produced as salable
products than the external, nonfeed, and energy input. NER is made as [21]:
NER = ( EP–EX ) / EX
(2)
where EP ＝ sum of energy contents of products
EX, non-renewable ＝ sum of energy values of external energy inputs except
feedstock
The overall thermal efficiency (ηE) for the production of uesful energy products is defined
as :
ηE = 100 ×〔EP / ( EF + Ex )〕
(3)where EP ＝ sum of energy contents of products
EF＝ energy content of feedstock
EX, non-renewable ＝ sum of energy values of external energy inputs except
feedstock

3.3 Net energy balance in the life-cycle processing
Table 7 lists the total energy requirement (input) and production (output) of the four
assessed energy production facilities in the LCP. The total energy requirements (input
energies) are between 5.42x 103 to 5.45 x103 MJ/tonne-year for the four assessed systems
and the average value is 5.43 x103 MJ/tonne-year. The energies of the gaseous products
(biofuel output energy) are among 7.30x 103 to 1.59 x104 MJ/tonne-year for the four
assessed systems and the average value is 1.16 x104 MJ/tonne-year. Despite our use of
expansive system boundaries for energy inputs, our analyses show that biofuel production
from rice straw results in positive net energy balance (NEB) ((output energy–total input
energy ) / (output energy ))(i.e., biofuel energy content exceeds fossil fuel energy inputs)
(Fig. 2; see also Table 7). The average of the total input energy is about 47% of the
average output energy (Fig. 1) and the value of NEB is 0.53. From Table 7, transportation
is the major part among the total input energy and is taken about 93.55 % of the total
input energy. It is obvious that energy requirement from the transportation is the major
energy consumption in the LCP. The assumption of the transportation distance of a circle
area is about 50 km as diameter, and that is a very broad boundary for energy accounting.
In really condition, the transportation distance from the rice farm to the 2nd generation
biofuel plant is less than 50 km in I-Lan county of Taiwan. In the next step, it is
interesting to assess different collection area or transportation distance to decrease the
energy requirement of transportation. The briquetting in-site for RDF to reduce the
transportation energy is an alternative choice after the nature drying process using solar
energy in the energy recovery of rice straw.
3.4 Energy indicators
We determine the net energy of a biofuel by subtracting the value of all fossil energy
inputs used in producing the biofuel from the energy value of the biofuel. Similarly, we
calculate the EROI, NER and ηE by Equations (1) to (3) according these outputs and
input energies. Table 8 and Fig. 3 show the energy indicators of the four assessed energy
production systems. All EROI values of the four assessed systems are larger than 1 and
the NER of LCPDGS and LCPPTS are greater than 1. The system of LCPPTS have the
highest values ofη E, NER and EROI with the value of 70.51%, 2.92 and 1.92,
respectively. The reason is that LCPPTS produces the highest heating value of gaseous
products. The ratio ηE indicates how much useful energy are produced than the energy
consumed by the system, and it is considered that the biomass feedstock energy content.
According to the first law of thermodynamics, EP can not exceed EF and EX.ηE expressed
as a percentage, the value must be between 0 % and 100 %. Because inefficiencies such
as friction, heat loss, and other factors, thermal efficiencies are typically much less than
100 %. EROI here is defined by the ratio to gain useful energy. Energy and other various
inputs are taken into the process and combined or consumed to produce energy in one or
more forms [25]. The higher the EROI, the more renewable the biofuel is [6]. EROI has
been used to investigate nuclear energy [26], ethanol [27-29], other biofuels [30], wood
energy [31], and other alternative energies [32-33]. It has also been used to survey the
energy efficiency of numerous fossil fuels [34]. The ratio of NER indicates how much
useful energy are produced than the energy consumed by the system if the external,
nonbiomass energy consumed is replaced, and it is assumed that the biomass feedstock
energy content is zero. This is a reasonable assumption because essentially 100 % of the
energy content of biomass is obtained from solar radiation via photosynthesis. In
calculation, the system greater than zero indicate that an amount of energy equivalent to
the sum of the external, nonbiomass energy inputs and an additional energy accession of
useful fuel are produced, and the larger the ratio, the larger the accession [21].

million tonnes every year [4], so 810 million tonnes of rice straw can be generated. The rice straw is
difficult for burning in most existing combustion systems. The reasons are: (1) the fouling of
deposits, (2) slag formation in furnaces and (3) accelerated corrosion [5]. Its common treatment is
on-site burning for producing manure. However, the open burning is harmful to the air quality and
environment, including the CO2 emission problem [6]. The reutilization of rice straw waste not only saves the
cost of disposal but also produces valuable bioenergy, achieving the goal of resources recovery and reuse. Also, the
reduced emissions of CO2 and SO2 as a result of utilization of biomass for energy generation are
further important for preventing the greenhouse effect and acid rain.
Transform of the wastes into energy can be efficiently achieved applying thermochemical methods
such as combustion, pyrolysis, partial oxidation and gasification [7-11]. The pyrolysis of biomass to
produce syngas offers an alternative supply of energy other than fossil fuels. Because the syngas
contains essentially molecular hydrogen and carbon monoxide, it has the potential for the use as a
high-quality fuel. Moreover, after purification, it becomes an important source of hydrogen which is
anticipated to be used in the future transport means employing fuel cell technology [12]. However,
there are some problems occurred in conventional pyrolysis processes, such as low gas productivity
and the generation of heavy tarry compounds, causing the corroding problem of the gas collection
equipment and increasing the need for the further treatment of the gas produced [13-15]. For the
pyrolysis or gasification of rice straw, Worasuwannarak et al. [16] applied the thermal gravimetry-
mass spectrometry technique to study the pyrolysis behaviors of rice straw, yielding the pyrolysis
products from rice straw at 873 K with compositions of char, H2O, CO, CO2, tar and sum of H2 and
CH4 of 31, 25, 15, 15, 10 and 4 wt.%, respectively. Thus, other than H2O, the CO and CO2 are the
dominant gas products, while H2 and CH4 are minor. Chen et al. [17] employed the catalysts to
pyrolyze the rice straw, improving the gas yields at 1023 K with respect to the original un-dried
sample containing about 10 wt.% H2O from 36 wt.% without catalyst to 41, 42.2 and 46 wt.% with
CaO, Na2CO3 and Cr2O3, respectively. However, even with the use of the catalyst of Cr2O3, the
yield of tar is still as high as 10 wt.% at least. Pütün et al. [6] reported that the feasible parameters
for the pyrolysis of rice straw are with particle diameter of 20–40 mesh, gas flow of 200 mL min-1,
final temperature of 823 K and the steam velocity of 2.7 cm s-1. Huang et al. [18] employed the
microwave-induced technology to pyrolyze the rice straw and yielded the H2-rich fuel gas of
nitrogen-free with H2, CO2, CO and CH4 of 55, 17, 13 and 10 vol.%, respectively. These
disadvantages and problems described above can be overcome via the use of thermal plasma
pyrolysis which offers some unique advantages for biomass conversion, such as providing high
temperature and heating rate, in comparison to conventional pyrolysis. Thermal plasma also offers
the possibility of decomposition of biomass by pure pyrolysis in the absence of oxygen. The high
energy density and temperature associated with thermal plasmas and the corresponding fast
reactions provide a potential solution for the problems occurred in conventional pyrolysis processes
[19-21]. Plasma torch in one of the thermal plasma technology and worked in the atmosphere, and it
is very drastic due to the presence of highly reactive atomic and ionic species and the achievement
of higher temperatures in comparison with other thermal methods. However, in fact, the extremely
high temperatures (several thousands degrees in Celsius scale) occur only in the core of the plasma,
while the temperature decreases substantially in the marginal zones [22]. The electrical energy
provides the energy need of the plasma torch which then transfers its energy to the substances to be
treated, thereby triggering a dual simultaneous reaction processes in the plasma-chemical reactor.
The organic compounds are thermally decomposed into simple compounds, shcu as syngas (CO and
H2) or their constituent elements. The inorganic materials are melted and converted into a dense,
inert and non-leachable vitrified slag, that does not require controlled disposal. The electrical energy

feeding, a sample of known pelletized mass (10 g) was placed on the sample input apparatus for
feeding the sample material. The flow rate of carrier gas of N2 (99.99 %) (QN) was adjusted to the
desired value, say 5 L min-1 at 101.3 kPa (1 atm) and 293 K, and was controlled by a rotameter. For
the power supply, the power supply control unit (chopper) (Taiwan Plasma Corp.) of plasma torch
reactor was set at specific power (PL) in the range of 2 to 6 kW for the temperatures (T) from 700 to
1000 K, respectively. PL for the plasma torch used has a maximum power output of 10 kW. After
the ignition by tricker, T can also be adjusted via QN or current from chopper (IC). The primary
sample feeding system consists of a closed cylinder hopper with upper and lower covers. The
hopper has a maximum size of 45 mm diameter and 55 mm length. The dried sample was placed in
the hopper that can be enclosed by upper and lower covers. The covers were alternatively opened
for feeding. For an accurate comparison of the effects from temperatures, the feeding type used in
this study was batch feeding with a 10 g sample for one run at a set temperature or supply power.
For the easy delivering and feeding, the rice straw was pelletized to a cylinder with the pellet size of
10 mm diameter and 20 mm length. The plasma torch converts electrical to thermal energy. The
applied high voltage on the electrodes results in electric discharges, which in turn generate the
current flowing from the anode (+) to the cathode (−) through the gas passing by. The ignition gas
such as N2 is initially introduced and ignited as the voltage is high enough, forming plasma torch.
After the ignition of plasma torch, the carrier gas such as N2 in then introduced. A certain
percentage of its molecules is partially or totally ionized, using the dissipation of resistive energy
which also makes the gas sufficiently hot. The ionized gas is thus in plasma state. The reactor is
comprised of a crucible, with approximate 1 L in capacity. Two shells were used for refractory
insulation in the reactor with outer and inner layers of 4 and 8 cm thickness which can tolerate the
temperatures as high as 1,673 and 2,073 K, respectively. The plasma was ejected from the torch
into the reactor. A thermocouple was inserted into the reactor for measuring the surrounding
temperature of plasma gas. The power supply was controlled via the feedback information from
temperature readings. The system was operated under atmospheric pressure. The effluent gas
surrounded by cooling water flowed through a rotameter and into a water-cooling bath, and then
vented to a quench system. Because the synthesis gas may contain acid gases (such as HCl or SO2),
the water-cooling bath can remove water-soluble components of the off-gas including hydrochloric
acid, most oxides of sulfur and suspended particles, prior to discharge to the quench system. In
order to measure the gas products, a gas chromatography was used for the analysis. For the analysis
of gas products, a Thermo Scientific FOCUS GC Gas Chromatograph GC-TCD with a Supelco
packing column (60/80 carbonxen-1000, 15 ft long, 2.1 mm i.d.) was used. The operation
conditions were set as follows: injector temperature 453 K, detector temperature 513 K, column
temperature (following the sampling injection) being held at 513 K for 10 min, helium carrier gas
flow rate 30 mL min-1 for A and B columns, and sample volume 2 mL. Several duplicate
experimental runs were performed in order to get the correct values.
2.3 Elemental analyses
The elemental analyses for the residues from the plasma pyrolysis of rice straw were made on a
Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT2400 elemental analyzer with 0.3 wt.% accuracy. The elements of C, H
and N were analyzed via Heraeus CHN-O-RAPID, and S analyzed via Tacussel Coulomax 78
automatic coulometric titrator.
2.4 Chemicals
The gas standards used for analyses were 99.9999% N2, and 99.9% CO2, CO, H2, HCl and SO2.
Quantitative analysis of gaseous products was based on the calculation using the linear calibration
response equations of standards. The equation was generated for each of gas standards using a

3.2 Effects of temperature in the instantaneous gaseous products
Carbon monoxide and hydrogen (syngas)
Gaseous samples were collected via the instantaneous sampling method and detected using GC-
TCD. The instantaneous concentrations of CO [CO] and H2 [H2] in gaseous products at various
temperatures (T) and reaction times (trsf, = reaction time of solid sample in furnace after loading) are
shown in Figs. 2 (a) and 2(b), respectively. From Fig. 2 (a), the maximum instantaneous
concentrations and the corresponding trsf of CO occur at 1) 284,335 ppmv and 0.25 min for 773 K,
2) 382,226 ppmv and 0.25 min for 873 K and 3) 276,829 ppmv and 0.25 min for 973 K,
respectively, with 0.5 min sampling interval. Fig. 2(b) shows that the maximum instantaneous [H2]
occur at 0.25 min with [H2] of 164,893 ppmv for 773 K, 234,100 ppmv for 873 K and 197,817
ppmv for 973 K, respectively, with 0.5 min sampling interval. The productions of CO and H2 are
the major components in the gas products with the temperatures yielding the maximum
concentrations at 873 K with relatively high reaction rates. The conversion of C to CO is more
vigorous than the formation of H2 as indicated in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) with [CO] higher than [H2].
The times for the occurrence of maximum instantaneous concentrations of CO and H2 are all at the
same time, saying 0.25 min. Almost 90% of gaseous products were appeared in 3 min reaction time.
Therefore, comparing with the conventional thermal pyrolysis, the reaction time of 3 min is
considerable shorter. Thus, the elevated heating rate of plasma torch allows the reaction reaching the
condition with maximum product concentration quickly. Therefore, the plasma torch can be
characterized with its elevated energy density that allows the treatment of solid waste such as rice
straw faster than the conventional thermal methods.
Methane and carbon dioxide
Figure 3(a) shows that the maximum instantaneous concentrations of CH4 occur at 16,416 ppmv for
773 K, 20,750 ppmv for 873 K and 7,534 ppmv for 973 K, respectively, all at 0.25 min reaction
time with 0.5 min sampling interval. It is obvious that the maximum concentration of CH4 is
occurring at 873 K. After the reaction time of 1.25 min, the concentration of CH4 can be neglected.
However, the maximum concentrations of CH4 for these three temperatures are still far lower than
those of the other gaseous products. From Fig. 4(b), the maximum instantaneous concentrations of
CO2 appear at 36,181 ppmv for 773 K, 32,761 ppmv for 873 K and 23,397 ppmv for 973 K,
respectively, all at 0.25 min reaction time with 0.5 min sampling interval. The concentrations of

occurring time of maximum concentration was delayed and the reason may be due to the longer
time for energy transfer to decompose the water molecule. This was also proved by the case of 35
wt.% moisture for appearing two maximum concentration peak (0.25 and 0.75 time). Fig. 4(b)
shows that the maximum instantaneous [H2] occur with [H2] of 234,722 ppmv at 0.75 min for 55
wt.%, 210,025 ppmv at 0.75 min for 35wt.% and 162,029 ppmv at 0.75 min for 15 wt.%,
respectively, with 0.5 min sampling interval. Relative to the case of 5 wt.% moisture, the occurring
times of the maximum concentration of H2 were all delayed and the energy transfer to decompose
water for the production of H and O element was more clearly. Therefore, the production of H2 was
affected by the moistures obviously. The productions of CO and H2 are the major components in the
gas products with the temperature at 873 K and above 15 wt.% moistures. Almost 90% of gaseous
products were appeared in 4 min reaction time. The energy intensity for the decompose of H2O is
enough for the plasma pyrolysis of rice straw.
Methane and carbon dioxide
Figure 5(a) shows that the maximum instantaneous concentrations of CH4 for 873 K occur at 13,426
ppmv for 55 wt.% at 0.75 min, 14,119 ppmv for 35 wt.% at 0.25 min, 11,608 ppmv for 15 wt.% at
0.25 min, respectively, with 0.5 min sampling interval. It is obvious that the maximum
concentration of CH4 is occurring at 35 wt.%. After the reaction time of 1.25 min, the concentration
of CH4 can be neglected. However, the maximum concentrations of CH4 for these three moistures
are still lower than that of 5 wt.% moisture, and far lower than those of the other gaseous products.
From Fig. 5(b), the maximum instantaneous concentrations of CO2 appear at 46,374 ppmv for 55
wt.% at 0.75 min, 36,839 ppmv for 35 wt.% at 0.25 min, and 31,967 ppmv for 15 wt.% at 0.25 min,,
respectively, with 0.5 min sampling interval. The maximum concentration of CO2 is occurring at 55
wt.%. It is obvious that moisture will increase the concentration of CO2. Therefore, the torrefaction
of rice straw for pretreatment in inhibiting of CO2 production has its positive benefit.
3.4 Effects of temperature and moisture in the accumulated gaseous products
The accumulated masses of gaseous products from the pyrolysis of rice straw using plasma torch for
three reaction temperatures and four moistures are shown in Table 2. The masses of all gas products
increase with the temperature and moisture increase. At the same moisture (5 wt.%) of rice straw,
the syngas ratio (= sum masses of syngas/dry basis of rice straw) increase from 20.03 wt.% at 773 K
to 23.96 wt.% at 973 K, respectively. High temperature will enhance the production of gas products
completely. For the syngas ratio of different moisture at 873 K, its value increases from 23.03 wt.%
of 5 wt.% moisture to 46.73 wt.% of 55 wt.% moisture, respectively. It is reasonable because the
total mass of sample (mass of rice straw and water) increase with the increase of moisture content. It
is also needed to note that the mass of H2 increase from 5 wt.% to 55wt.% moisture by 2.26 times at
873 K. Therefore, the addition of moisture enhances the production of H2 obviously and this may be
due to the decomposition of water to supply the hydrogen source. The similar tendencies are also
appeared in the accumulated masses of CH4 and CO2, especially for the CO2

33
H2 at 15 wt.% moisture and 873 K, respectively. From Fig. 9(a), the maximum accumulated syngas
yield and the corresponding occurring moisture and temperature is 86.97 wt.% at 5 wt.% and 873 K.
The yield of H2 increases with the increasing of temperature. Also from Fig. 9(b), the maximum
accumulated CO2 yield and the corresponding occurring moisture and temperature is 18.86 wt.% at
55 wt.% and 873 K. The addition of moisture increases the CO2 yield obviously. The syngas in this
study has more mass or volume yields at lower moisture and CO2 yield has more mass or volume
yields at higher moisture. The reason may be due to the contribution of the 5 to 55 wt.% moisture
in the rice straw and the water content increases the yields of H2 and CO2 in pyrolysis via plasma
technology. This implies again that the torrefaction process of the biomass can be controlled at
elevated moisture for the different target compound product. Shie et al. [20] used a 60 kW small
pilot plasma torch to examine the pyrolysis of sunflower-oil cake, which was sampled from the de-
oil sunflower seed after pressing. Depending on the operation temperatures, the main components of
products were H2 (47.35-56.13 vol.%), CO (39.82-51.17 vol.%), CO2 (0.43-1.65 vol.%) and NOx
(1.67-6.65 vol.%). Hrabovsky et al. [26] also used an experimental reactor equipped with the hybrid
gas-water stabilized torch with arc power up to 160 kW to examine the gasification and pyrolysis of
wood. Depending on the operation conditions, the main components of produced syngas were H2
(28-46 vol.%), CO (44-68 vol.%), CO2 (2-8 vol.%) and Ar (0.2-8 vol.%). The similar products from
the treatment biomass using plasma technology are also appeared in other works [12, 19, 21, 23, 24-
25, 27]. From these references, no complex hydrocarbons and tar were detected in plasma
technologies. Therefore, the analyses of hydrocarbons and tar were not performed in this study.

In this study, the feedstock of rice straw was treated by plasma torch in a reactor chamber, whereby
organic components were converted into a syngas of high caloric value, and inorganic components
were converted into non-leachable vitrified lava. The possible reaction paths of plasma pyrolysis of
cellulose of rice straw with moisture are listed below.

production would also reduce the environmental damage, for instance, CO2 emission in treatment of
agricultural residues. In generally, use of biomass substituting fossil fuels for electricity and heat
production is less costly and more efficient for resource utilization than replacing gasoline or diesel
for transportation.
4. CONCLUSION
This study investigated the results of a new research and development program for plasmas torch
technology on the applications for biomass energy utilization. The present work performed the
biomass treatment using a 10 kW thermal plasma torch as the heat source and the rice straw as
feedstock. In this study, a torch plasma thermolysis reactor is used for pyrolyzing the biomass waste
of rice straw at different temperatures and moisture contents. This novel method has several
advantages including high heating rate, short heating time, no viscous tar and low residual char or
lava (7.45~13.78 wt.%). The maximum concentrations of gaseous products occurring times are all
below 1 min. Almost 90% of gaseous products were appeared in 4 min reaction time. The inorganic
components were converted into non-leachable vitrified lava which is non-hazardous. The
productions of CO and H2 are the major components in the gas products with the temperatures
yielding the maximum concentrations at 873 K with relatively high reaction rates. With the increase
of moisture (5 - 55 wt.% ), the mass yields of H2 and CO2 also increase from the H2O
decomposition. However, due to the CO2 production, the accumulated volume fraction of syngas
decreases with the increase of moisture. The obtained data and information are useful for the
rational operation and design of pyrolysis of rice straw via plasma torch. In practical, the rice straw
can be pre-treated via pelletization to prepare the refuse derived fuel before being charged into the
reactor. This can increase the density of rice straw pellet and the capacity of loading, enhancing the
energy utilization efficiency. Therefore, the optimum reaction condition should be controlled at
suitable input power and moisture content.
