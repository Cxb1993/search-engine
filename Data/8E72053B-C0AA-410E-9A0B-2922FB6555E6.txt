摘要 
本年度計畫針對新型高溫無鉛銲料 Bi-Ag 常用基材 Cu、Ni 銲點組織、介面
反應物奈米壓痕測試以及高溫時效前後銲點拉伸破壞行為等進行系統性探討。 
Bi-Ag 與 Cu 基材反應介面並未生成金屬間化合物，而以形成 Cu 晶界溝槽
(grain boundary grooving)做為機械鍵結。接合狀態之銲點拉伸強度與
Pb-5Sn/Cu 相當。較高的 Ag 含量加深溝槽深度，有助於穩定拉伸性質。經高溫
時效之 Bi-Ag/Cu 銲點雖因溝槽深度變淺強度略為降低，但仍具相當的可靠度。
反觀 Pb-5Sn/Cu 因 Cu3Sn 厚度明顯增加，以及可能伴隨生成的 Kirkendall 
voids，造成接合強度大幅下降。 
Bi-Ag 與 Ni 反應介面產生金屬間化合物 NiBi3及 NiBi，NiBi 之硬度與彈性
模數較 NiBi3高上許多(NiBi：硬度 1.55GPa、模數為 39.28；NiBi3硬度 7.23GPa、
模數 132.7GPa)，於接合狀態主要生成相為 NiBi3。高溫時效過程中 NiBi3及 NiBi
因基材與銲料間互擴散而成長，但各別之厚度及成長速率受銲料中富 Ag 相(尤其
是初晶 Ag)影響相當大，其中 Bi-2.5Ag/Ni 之 NiBi3 經時效 30 天異常增厚至
80μm。與 Pb-5Sn/Ni 銲點穩定的拉伸強度相較，Bi-Ag/Ni 因 Ni-Bi 化合物與
Kirkendall voids 大量生成，接合強度低且數據發散，證實一般用來做為擴散阻
礙層的 Ni 並不適合 Bi-Ag 銲料接合用途。

reached 80 μm after a 30 day aging in the case of Bi-2.5Ag/Ni.   It was found 
that Ag-rich phases within the solders, especially the massive primary Ag, 
considerably affected the growth of these Ni-Bi compounds.  In addition, the 
presence of NiBi and NiBi3 and a large amount of voids of thermal aged 
Bi-Ag/Ni joints resulted in a deteriorated and scattered tensile strength 
compared to Pb-5Sn/Ni.  This suggested that Ni, commonly used as the 
diffusion barrier, was not suitable for Bi-Ag soldering applications.

第二章  文獻回顧 
2-1 高溫無鉛銲料的開發 
近年來已有數種高溫無鉛銲料被提出[4-6]。由圖 2-1 溫度看出，符合高溫銲
料的條件只有 Pb 系與 Au 系的合金。其中 Au-20Sn[4]熔點相當理想，目前亦用
於 LED 晶粒接合，但相較於其他銲料的硬度圖 2-2。其硬度過高並不易於加工，
且 Au 的成本過高，故其用途受到限制。Sn-Sb 及 Sn-Ag-Sb 系列固相線溫度過
低(圖 2-1)，提高其 Sb 含量雖有助降低其較低熔點之組成比例，但將導致機械強
度過高、易脆。此外，Sb 具毒性不宜過量添加均為負面效應[7]。 
亦有研究者提出 Zn 基的晶片接合銲料[5,6]。其中具代表性且熔點適中，銲
錫性優良者當屬 Zn-4Al-3Ga-3Mg，運用此合金接合晶片之元件已通過恆溫恆濕
(85oC-85% humidity)以及熱疲勞(-65oC~150oC)測試。但由於該合金硬度過高、
加工性不佳，易氧化並且可能發生沿晶脆化，仍非理想的取代材料。2005 年底
日本大阪大學 Suganuma 教授提出 Zn-Sn(Zn-20~40%Sn)系列高溫銲料[8]，但
該合金共晶溫度僅 199 oC，於後續迴銲過程中已呈半熔融狀態，其機械強度是
否足夠實存在疑慮。 
純 Bi 融點 271 oC，符合溫度要求，但其機械性質、電導及熱導性不良，欲
做為高溫銲料必須進行冶金改質。日本東北大學與 Toyota 研發中心的團隊今年
內(2006)連續提出兩種 Bi 系高溫銲料改質對策，一為在 Bi 中添加 CuAlMn 顆粒
[9]，其強度可達純 Bi 兩倍，且其晶片接點之耐熱疲勞可靠度尚可。另一為
BiCu-X(X=Sb, Sn and Zn) [11]，其組織含不少高溫相如 Cu2Sb、Cu3Sn 及 CuZn 
(熔解起始溫度分別為 552 oC、733 oC、859 oC)。由於報導中未提及該系列合金
之機械性質與導熱等性能表現，因而無法評估其適用性。 
2002年起陸續有業者 (Honeywell electronic materials以及  Cookson 
electronics、Indium Corp. of America等)[4,9]提出以Bi-Ag(圖2-3)合金做為晶片接
合銲料的可行性。該系統合金共晶溫度262.5 oC且質軟，相關特性也陸續被研究
報導。 
 
2-2 Bi-Ag銲料相關研究

2-0(b))。此結果顯示提升液態 Bi 中之 Cu 含量，可降低液態 Bi 中飽合與實際 Cu
濃度差，此時結構鬆散之晶界溶解速率將明顯大於晶粒平滑表面，造成晶界溝槽。 
 
2-4 Bi 與 Ni 基材介面反應 
Ni-Bi 二元相圖指出該系統有兩種穩定中間相，NiBi3及 NiBi。Dybkov[11-13]
研究指出，Bi 與 Ni 固態擴散反應介面僅生成斜方晶結構之 NiBi3 (orthorhombic, 
a=0.8875nm、b=0.4112nm，c=1.1477nm)。作者推測相圖中另一化合物 NiBi
未生成的原因為 NiBi3 尚未到達臨界厚度。Dybkov 更指出 NiBi3 成長為擴散控
制(Diffusion controlled)，且主要擴散原子為 Bi 原子，反應主要發生在 Ni-NiBi3
介面。 
介面金屬間化合物的擴散成長動力學以下列公式計算[14-16]： 
dt=(
10
1
k
x
k
+ )dx 
x：介面在時間 t 時金屬間化合物(IMC)的厚度。 
k0：chemical constant 。 
k1：physical (diffusional) constant。  
當長到一定厚度後，介面化學反應轉為擴散反應故 k0>>k1。上列公式簡化為： 
dt=
1k
x dx 
當反應初始狀態，時間 t=0，x=0。得到公式解為： 
x2=2k1t 
因此當金屬間化合物成長為擴散控制時，其厚度對時間二分之一次方其斜
率為固定值，由斜率求得 k1。 
圖 2-10 顯示 NiBi3厚度對時間二分之一次方的關係，由其斜率計算不同溫
度(150 oC、200 oC，250 oC)下的反應擴散常數 k1表 2-1。溫度影響擴散常數 k1，
且可由 Arrhenius equation 表示： 
k1=Aexp(-E/RT) 
 6
NiBi/NiBi3介面反應為 1 mole Ni 與 1 mole NiBi3反應生成 2 mole NiBi 及 1 mole 
Bi 原子；1 mole Bi 原子又擴散至 Ni 介面反應，生成 1 mole NIBi。故 d2/d1=0.5 
Ni+NiBi3 ( 2NiBi+Bi    (caseⅢ, NiBi/NiBi3 interface) 
Bi+Ni ( NiBi           (caseⅢ, Ni/NiBi interface) 
以實際量測 d2/d1=1~1.5 來看，反應主要由 caseⅠ和 caseⅢ的機制所控制。

晶 Bi-2.5wt.%Ag 及過共晶 Bi-11wt.%Ag 合金(簡稱 pure Bi、Bi-2.5Ag 及
Bi-11Ag)。此外以同樣方法製備 Pb-5wt.%Sn 合金(簡稱 Pb-5Sn)以利比較。 
3-2 試片製備 
將直徑 2mm 的純銅、純鎳棒裁成 15mm 長，截表面以 1200 號砂紙研磨平
整。試片經過熱鹼洗(80 oC 之 5wt.% NaOH 溶液)、酸洗(10vol.% HNO3溶液)，
最後以去離子水洗淨。沾上助銲劑(DMAHCL)後以不鏽鋼夾具將兩欲接合試棒對
準固定，間隙控制在 0.3mm，如圖 3-1 所示。放入 350℃合金熔湯中，靜置 1min
後取出空冷(冷卻速率約 8 oC /s)，此狀態試片稱接合態(as-jointed)試片。

第四章結果與討論 
4-1 Bi-Ag/Cu 及 Pb-5Sn/Cu 銲點介面形態與拉伸性質 
4-1-1 接合態(as-jointed)及經時效(aged)銲點組織特徵 
圖 4-1(a)及(b)分別為 Bi-2.5Ag 及 Bi-11Ag 銲料與 Cu 基材於 350oC 反應 1
分鐘介面組織，顯示 Bi-Ag/Cu 介面並未生成金屬間化合物 (Intermetallic 
compound)。Bi-2.5Ag/Cu 及 Bi-11Ag/Cu 介面均可觀察到局部凹陷的情形，尤
以 Bi-11Ag 者較為明顯，此外亦觀察 Bi-11Ag/Cu 介面有附著生成之粗大初晶
Ag。圖 4-2 為上述 Bi-Ag/Cu 時效前後介面放大組織，其中圖 4-2(a)(b)顯示 Bi-Ag
銲料有沿 Cu 晶界形成溝槽(grain boundary grooving)的現像，圖 4-2(c)(d)則顯
示與接合態介面比較，經 150oC 時效 30 天之 Bi-Ag/Cu 介面均變得較為平坦，
溝槽變淺。圖 4-3(a)(b)分別為 Pb-5Sn/Cu 時效前後介面組織，均發現層狀 Cu3Sn
的生成，且該金屬間相反應層經時效厚度明顯增加。 
圖 4-4 定量量測上述 Bi-Ag/Cu 介面晶界溝槽深度與 Pb-5Sn/Cu 介面 Cu3Sn
厚度隨高溫時效時間變化情形，顯示於接合態時，Bi-11Ag/Cu 確實較 Bi-2.5Ag
具較深之晶界溝槽，亦即 Ag 含量的增加有助於 grain boundary grooving。時效
15 天後兩者溝槽深度有下降趨勢，繼續時效至 30 天則無明顯變化。Pb-5Sn/Cu
介面 Cu3Sn 生成物經 30 天時效由 0.6μm 增厚至 2.8μm。 
圖 4-5 則顯示以奈米壓痕儀分析上述經時效 Cu3Sn 之硬度與彈性模數隨壓
入深度變化(圖4-5(a)(b))以及壓痕形貌(圖4-5(c))。結果顯示本實驗生成之Cu3Sn
的硬度為 6.98GPa，彈性模數則為 140.031GPa，與文獻[20-25](表 4-1)相較，硬
度略高、模數則相當。圖 4-5(c)之壓痕形貌顯示壓痕周圍並無裂縫產生。 
圖 4-6 為接合態及經時效 Bi-2.5Ag/Cu 銲點內部組織及 Cu、Ag 元素分佈。
圖 4-6(a)顯示銲點接合態僅共晶組織部份偵測到 Ag 元素，值得注意的是 Cu 元
素存在於亞共晶 Bi 及共晶區域，其中亞共晶 Bi 之 Cu 訊號強度較低，經定量分
析得知基地平均 Cu 含量約 0.538at.%（圖 4-6(c)）。Cu 於共晶區域之分佈相當
不均勻，其訊號集中呈圓形顆粒狀，經研判應為 Cu 基材溶入液態 Bi 所生成之
 22
而形成部份 Cu 裸露，但兩者之拉伸強度相差不大。時效後 Bi-Ag/Cu 及
Pb-5Sn/Cu 銲點強度均下降，其中 Bi-Ag/Cu 介面之機械鍵結因晶界溝槽變淺因
而降低(見圖 4-4)，而 Pb-5Sn/Cu 之強度因時效大幅下降的原因除了介面 Cu3Sn
增厚所可能造成之脆化之外，介面處因 Cu3Sn 成長所生成之 Kirkendall voids 可
能為該介面接合強度弱化主因[29]。圖 4-11(a)(b)為 Bi-Ag/Cu 與 Pb-5Sn/Cu 的破
壞示意圖。 
 
4-2 Bi-Ag/Ni 及 Pb-Sn/Ni 介面形態與拉伸特性 
4-2-1 接合態及經時效銲點組織特徵 
圖 4-12(a)(b)分別為液態 Bi-2.5Ag 及 Bi-11Ag 與 Ni 基材反應 1min 介面組
織，兩介面處均觀察到由柱狀 NiBi3組成之金屬間相反應層。銲點內可發現少量
游離 NiBi3，Bi-11Ag 試片另在介面處觀察到粗大初晶 Ag。圖 4-12(c)(d)為銲點
於 150oC 時效 30 天後之介面組織，其中圖 4-12(c) 中 Bi-2.5Ag/Ni 的 NiBi3異常
成長至厚度約 80μm，且在靠近基材處形成一極薄 NiBi 層，另在在 NiBi3與銲料
間觀察到Ag顆粒堆積。圖 4-12(d) Bi-11Ag/Ni介面之 NiBi明顯較Bi-2.5Ag者厚，
但其 NiBi3 厚度僅約 20μm。特別值得注意的是 NiBi3 與 Bi-11Ag 銲料間除了有
Ag顆粒堆積外，更有粗大變形的初晶Ag及其靠NiBi3端之大面積孔洞。圖4-13(a)
為 Pb-5Sn/Ni 介面組織，生成之金屬間化合物 Ni3Sn4都相當薄，圖 4-13(b)經時
效後厚度僅約 1μm。 
進一步定量 Bi-Ag/Ni 介面反應生成物厚度與時效時間關係如圖 4-14 所示。
圖 4-14(a)為 NiBi3 成長厚度與時效時間作圖，Bi-2.5Ag/Ni 中 NiBi3 從接合態約
2μm 經 30 天時效增厚至約 80μm，而 Bi-11Ag/Ni 介面之 NiBi3則在時效 15 天後
便停滯在約 20μm 不再成長。圖 4-14(b)為 NiBi 的厚度對時效時間作圖， 
Bi-2.5Ag/Ni 及 Bi-11Ag/Ni NiBi。在時效 15 天後，Bi-2.5Ag/Ni 的 NiBi 成長至約
1μm，但延長時效時間至 30 天時卻未進一步增厚，Bi-11Ag/Ni 的 NiBi 隨時效時
間增厚至 2.3μm。

的擴散常數，顯示 NiBi 成長速率與銲料 Ag 含量成反比。

圖 4-20 顯示 Bi-Ag/Ni 與 Pb-5Sn/Ni 銲點接合態拉伸數據，Pb-5Sn/Ni 平均
拉伸強度比 Bi-Ag/Ni 合金高且數據相對集中，Bi-Ag/Ni 的拉伸數據相當的發散，
而以 Bi-2.5Ag/Ni 的平均強度略高。圖 4-21(a)為 Bi-2.5Ag/Ni 的破斷面，顯示劈
裂破壞形貌，局部破壞面有許多的小坑洞 (圖 4-21(b))，且於坑洞底部可觀察到
NiBi3 晶粒(圖 4-21(c))。圖 4-22(a)顯示具相同脆性破壞特徵之 Bi-11Ag/Ni 破壞
面，且可觀察到部份裸露的 Ni 基材。圖 4-22(b)則觀察到裸露之 Ni 基材上分佈
細小 NiBi 顆粒。 
圖 4-23(a)接合態 Bi-2.5Ag/Ni 的部份破壞起始點位於介面 NiBi3 與銲料之
間，裂縫傳播與發生脆性破壞的塊材類似。圖 4-23(b)Bi-11Ag/Ni 的破壞行為則
略有不同，由於該條件試片確實已生成 NiBi，破壞可能由此處發生，導致基材裸
露，也因此造成 Bi-11Ag/Ni 較弱的接合強度。 
 
4-2-3 高溫時效對拉伸破壞行為影響 
圖 4-24 顯示 Bi-Ag/Ni 與 Pb-5Sn/Ni 銲點經時效試片拉伸數據，Pb-5Sn/Ni
於時效前後平均強度並未沒太大變化，然而兩組 Bi-Ag/Ni 試片則嚴重劣化。圖
4-25(a)為經拉伸破壞之 Bi-2.5Ag/Ni 銲點破斷面，可觀察到破壞面相當平整，經
成份分析皆為 NiBi，縱剖面組織亦證實破壞主要發生在 NiBi 層(4-25(b))。圖
4-25(c)(d)則為經時效 Bi-11Ag/Ni 破壞形貌與剖面組織，發現破壞表面相當粗
糙，圖 4-25(d)剖面圖可以明顯的看出破壞在 NiBi3與 Bi-Ag 銲料之間。

endothermal peak, but the reductions in temperature
were not identical. The exothermic peak for the eutectic
reaction of the Bi-2.5Ag sample was observed at a
higher temperature than that for the Bi-11Ag, which was
in turn slightly higher than the peak for solidiﬁcation of
pure Bi. During cooling, a small exothermic peak was
detected in the DSC curve of the Bi-11Ag at around
350 C in Figure 2(a) and 340 C in Figure 2(b). This
exothermal behavior was due to the crystallization of
the primary Ag phase in the melt.
The transition points and undercooling for each
specimen under diﬀerent testing conditions are listed in
Table I. In this study, the degree of undercooling is
obtained from the diﬀerence in peak temperature
between endothermic and exothermal reactions. It is
worth noting that, under all the conditions, the und-
ercooling of pure Bi was greater than the Bi-Ag alloys,
for which the degree of undercooling might not be
related to the Ag content. Table I also reveals that a
reduction in the sample weight (sample size) and an
increase in the rate of heating/cooling aﬀected the
speciﬁc temperatures, especially for raising the liquidus
temperature upon heating and lowering the peak tem-
perature upon cooling. However, the lowest undercool-
ing measured in this study, 31.9 C for the Bi-11Ag
sample, is still tremendous. This can be ascribed to the
rhombohedral structure of Bi, because a large superco-
oling can be obtained for metals having a more complex
crystal structure including Sn, Bi, Ga, and the like.[12]

Figures 5 and 6 display the deformation structure and
crack growth morphology of the tensile fractured
samples. Deformation of bismuth by twinning is rela-
tively easy compared to other materials (Schmid factor
is 0.48) especially at high deformation rates.[15] How-
ever, in this work, no twins were revealed in the
deformed areas (Figure 6). Accordingly, the possible
deformation mechanism in this case could be considered
as dislocation slip on (111) planes rather than twin-
ning.[16] The smooth ﬂat cleavage surfaces shown in
Figure 4 were likely (111) plane.[17]
The crack propagation morphology provides further
information regarding microstructural eﬀect on tensile
behavior. The cross-sectional structure of the fractured
Bi-2.5Ag sample (Figure 5(a)) displays long straight
cracks propagating zigzag across Bi-Ag eutectic cells
when tensioned under the high strain rate condition. On
the other hand, primary Ag in the necked region of the
Bi-11Ag tended to elongate along the tensile direction
and the fracture surface was much more ragged (Fig-
ure 5(b)). Magniﬁed structure in Figure 6(a) illustrates
that cracks grew directly across the eutectic and proeu-
tectic regions of the Bi-11Ag sample with very few
meanders. This indicates that those structures were not
able to resist the crack growth eﬀectively. In contrast,
the cracks became more tortuous and branching when
massive primary Ag was encountered (Figures 6(b) and
(c)). It could also be observed that the cracks grew
around the primary Ag particles without penetrating
them. The preceding observation implies that, besides
stunting crack propagation, ductile phase such as
primary Ag may accommodate the stress intensity,

The present study investigated interfacial reactions between Cu substrates
and Bi-Ag alloys during soldering. Without forming intermetallic compounds
(IMCs), the molten solder grooved and further penetrated along the grain
boundaries (GBs) of the Cu substrate. An increase in Ag content enhanced GB
grooving, raised the dissolution rate and also the amount of dissolved Cu in
molten Bi. A stoichiometric Cu-Bi phase formed isothermally in liquid solders
and considerably affected the Cu dissolution kinetics. The results also show
that Bi-Ag/Cu joints possessed a better shear strength than the Pb-Sn/Cu,
which implies that mechanical bonding by grain-boundary grooves was strong
enough to withstand shear deformation.

INTRODUCTION
Due to environmental concerns, the use of Pb will
soon be banned in the electronic packaging indus-
try. Hence the search for lead-free solders has re-
cently become an important issue. The Pb-free
replacement solders for eutectic Sn-Pb, such as Sn-
Ag-Cu and Sn-Zn, have been well studied. However,
the development of high-temperature Pb-free sol-
ders to replace conventional high-Pb alloys, for
example Pb-3–5Sn, is still in its infancy. A high-Pb
solder should have a solidus higher than 260C, so
that the solder is capable of surviving secondary
reflow at 250C. The liquidus also needs to be lower
than 400C due to the limitation of the glass-tran-
sition temperature of the polymeric substrate.1
Among the proposed alloy systems, their proper
eutectic temperature of 262.5C makes the Bi-Ag
alloys with a eutectic composition of Bi-2.5wt.%Ag
a promising replacement.1–3 However, the develop-
ment of this solder alloy system is still ongoing,
mainly due to its inferior thermal and electrical
conductivity as well as poor workability. It has
recently been demonstrated that increasing the Ag
content of Bi-Ag to 11 wt.% promotes an increase in
thermal conductivity2 and ductility.4
Copper is the most common electronic substrate.
A recent report indicated that grooves which ap-
peared at the intersections of Cu grain boundaries
with the Bi-Ag/Cu interface were believed to provide
mechanical bonding for Bi-Ag/Cu joints.5 To gain
deeper insight into this solder system, quantitative
investigation of the interaction between the Cu
substrate and Bi-Ag alloys during soldering, as well
as the shear performance of the joints, was per-
formed in this study.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
The solder alloys used were eutectic Bi-2.5Ag and
hypereutectic Bi-11Ag. Pure Bi was also prepared
for comparison. As shown in Fig. 1, 5 g of the solder
was placed in a quartz tube with a 5 mm inner
diameter and then soaked in a salt bath at a fixed
temperature. The Cu wire specimens (annealed
99.9% pure Cu) of 1 mm in diameter were sequen-
tially degreased in NaOH solution, deoxidized in
HNO3 and dipped in a dimethylammonium chloride

shown in Fig. 6c and d. The depth of GB grooves
after 120 min reaction were measured and are listed
in Table III, which shows that either Ag additions
or an increased reaction temperature accelerate the
GB grooving of Cu by liquid Bi.

solved Cu and liquid solders are illustrated in Fig. 7.

Interestingly, in the Ag containing solders, Fig. 7c
and d, the Cu-Bi phase exhibited a round appearance
and contained a certain amount of Ag (the composi-

DISCUSSION
Based on the binary Bi-Cu phase diagram,6 the
theoretical solubility of Cu in liquid Bi was esti-
mated to be about 0.28 wt.% at 350C, 0.41 wt.% at
380C and 0.6 wt.% at 410C. However, the above
results show that the amounts of dissolved Cu in
both pure Bi and Bi-Ag liquids at these tempera-
tures were much higher. According to Dybkov
analysis of the kinetics of dissolution of a solid in a
liquid,7 the dissolution of substrate into the solder
liquid can be expressed as
dc
dt
¼ k S
V
ðcs  cÞ ð1Þ
where cs = the solubility limit of substrate element
in the liquid at the reaction temperature, c = con-
centration of the substrate, k = dissolution rate
constant, S = surface area of the substrate, and V =
volume of the liquid. When c = cs, the rate of sub-
strate atoms going into the liquid is equal to the rate
of atoms leaving the liquid for the substrate. That
brings about a termination of the dissolution
reaction because a dynamic equilibrium is held be-
tween the substrate and the liquid. However, the
dissolution data in this study show that the radii of
the substrate proceeded to reduce even when the
dissolved amount exceeded the theoretical value,
which implies that the dynamic equilibrium no
longer existed. In order to explain this unusual
behavior, the phenomena observed, including GB
grooving and the formation of Cu-Bi phase, should
be clarified.
Grain-boundary grooving and even penetration
were demonstrated to occur at Bi/Cu and Bi-Ag/Cu

produced only by precipitation from Bi supersatu-
rated with Cu in the absence of Cu nuclei. Thus we
can consider that in the isothermal liquid Bi with-
out Cu nuclei, Cu-Bi phase forms preferentially
(Fig. 12). If Cu nuclei are present, the Cu atoms will
deposit on them to form the stable phase, Cu, in
preference to forming the Cu-Bi compound. The
Cu-Bi phase still deserves to pay attention, since it
significantly influences the Cu substrate dissolution
process and furthermore, it will remain and grow in
the structure after high temperature storage at
150C instead of decomposition.11 However, very
little is know about this phase at this juncture and
further comment will be reserved until additional
investigations are completed.
In the case of Cu dissolved in liquid Bi-Ag, it was
found that a small portion of Cu was substituted by
Ag and the shape of Cu-Bi phase became round.
Most importantly, the amount of the Ag containing
Cu-Bi precipitates was larger than for Cu-Bi in
liquid Bi. Therefore, it can be inferred that Ag
enhanced the formation of Cu-Bi, resulting in a
reduced Cu concentration in liquid, which may have
been responsible for the greater quantity and speed

This study investigated the interfacial morphology and tensile properties of
the joints between Bi-Ag solders and two metallic substrates, Cu and Ni.
Instead of forming intermetallic compounds, grooving occurred at the inter-
sections of Cu grain boundaries with the Bi-Ag/Cu interface and thus provided
mechanical bonding. As for the Ni substrate, cellular NiBi3 was observed at
the interface and also, massive NiBi3 in the form of long blades emanating
from the interface was located within the solder region. A thin NiBi layer
formed through a solid-state reaction between NiBi3 and the solder. The for-
mation of those Ni-Bi intermetallics had a strong inﬂuence on the tensile
strength and fracture morphology of the Bi-Ag/Ni joints.

INTRODUCTION
The development of Pb-free solders has become
an important issue for electronic interconnection
materials because of the health and environmental
concerns involved with lead usage. Up to now, a
suitable Pb-free alternative to replace high Pb sol-
ders (e.g., 95Pb-5Sn, with a melting range from
308°C to 312°C) has not been found. A Pb-free
replacement for high Pb-solders must satisfy the
following basic requirements:1 (1) a solidus higher
than 260°C, so that the solder can survive secon-
dary reﬂow at 250°C; (2) a liquidus lower than
400°C, due to the limitation of the glass transition
temperature of the polymeric substrate; (3) a low
shear modulus, to moderate the coefﬁcient of
thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch between die
and substrate; and (4) good thermal conductivity
(.20 W/mK) and low electrical resistivity (,100
mV cm). Among the alloy systems being considered
as high-temperature solder candidates, the solidus
temperature of Sn-Sb alloys is too low and Au-Sn
eutectic alloys possess a hardness of about 20 times
that of Pb-5Sn.2,3 Shimizu et al.4 found that Zn-Al-
Mg-Ga exhibits acceptable melting behavior. How-
ever, it was not ductile enough for manufacturing
into wire or ribbon and has poor wetting and oxida-
tion resistance.
The Bi-Ag eutectic system exhibits an acceptable
melting point (the eutectic temperature is 262.5°C
at the eutectic composition, Bi-2.5wt.%Ag),5 similar
hardness to that of Pb-5Sn, and affordable cost.
Thus, it has been developed as die attach solders
for power devices and light-emitting diode (LEDs).
The development of this solder alloy system is still
ongoing mainly due to its inferior thermal and elec-
trical conductivity as well as poor workability. It has
been demonstrated that raising the Ag content of
Bi-Ag to 11wt.% promotes an increase in thermal
conductivity.2 A recent study6 revealed that the elec-
trical resistivity of the Bi-11wt.%Ag alloy is 86.5 mV
cm, which is much lower that that of the Bi-
2.5wt.%Ag eutectic specimen, 116.5 mV cm. Due to
lack of relevant reports, this study investigated the
interfacial structure of Bi-Ag solders with sub-
strates after soldering. The tensile behavior of the
joints was also examined. Two commonly used elec-
tronic substrates, Cu and Ni, were employed.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Bi-Ag alloys with the Ag content of 2.5 wt.% and
11 wt.%, designated as Bi-2.5Ag and Bi-11Ag respec-
tively, were prepared by melting pure bismuth and
pure silver in an arc-melting furnace in an argon
atmosphere. To understand the solidiﬁcation
behavior of the alloys, cooling curves were measured
by inserting a thermocouple into 150 g of molten(Received December 18, 2005; accepted January 18, 2006)

Remarkably, grain boundary grooving of Cu
occurred at Bi-Ag interfaces. Take the Bi-11Ag/Cu
interface for example, magniﬁed images of the inter-
faces (Fig. 7) show that a preferred dissolution at
the Cu grain boundaries occurred. With a prolonged
reaction, the molten solder tended to penetrate into
the Cu grain boundaries.
Figure 8 gives the tensile strength of the joints
after 1 min. of soldering at 350°C. The average joint
strength of the Bi-Ag/Cu samples was close to that
of the Pb-5Sn/Cu samples in this study. The Pb-5Sn
samples possessed an identical fracture strength to
those described in a previous report.7 However, the
data for Bi-2.5Ag/Cu samples was spread over a
wider range.
As displayed in Fig. 9, the fracture surface of
the Bi-11Ag/Cu sample reveals that fracturing
mostly occurred within the solder, while that of
the Bi-2.5Ag/Cu sample with a relatively low joint
strength show a large area of exposed Cu indicating
interfacial fracturing. The cross-sectional structure
and magniﬁed fractography (Fig. 10) indicate that
the grain boundary grooving of Cu was more pro-
nounced in the case of the Bi-11Ag/Cu interface
(Fig. 10c and d). On the other hand, the degree of
grain boundary grooving at the Bi-2.5Ag/Cu inter-
face was relatively low. The surface of exposed Cu

Tensile Behavior of Ni/Bi-Ag/Ni Joints
Figure 11a–d displays the interfacial morphology
between Bi-2.5Ag/Ni reacted at 350°C for 1 min. and
5min., respectively. Ni-Bi compounds can be observed
both at the interface and in the bulk region. After
soldering for 1 min., a gray interfacial layer with an
irregular morphology and blade-like compounds with-
in the solidiﬁed solder (also in gray) were found.
These two phases were identiﬁed as NiBi3 according
to their chemical composition. With a prolonged reac-
tion time of 5 min., the interfacial NiBi3 layer became
thicker and a thin dark layer, NiBi, could be observed
between the NiBi3 and the Ni substrate. Some cracks
could be observed at the front of the cellular NiBi3 in
both the samples reacted for 1 min. and 5 min. Some
large cracks ran parallel to the thickness direction of
the thickened interfacial NiBi3 compounds.

Formation of Ni-Bi Compounds and
Inﬂuence on Joint Tensile Properties
Formation of Ni-Bi intermetallics through solid–
liquid or solid–solid reactions between Bi and Ni has
been investigated systematically.13–18 Kao et al.16
reported that a less compact NiBi3 layer formed at
the interface between liquid Bi and Ni substrate at
temperatures ranging from 300°C to 480°C. Aligned
NiBi3 needles, which mainly precipitate during sol-
idiﬁcation, were also found emanating from the
interfacial NiBi3 layer. Reaction temperature may
affect the solubility limit and the diffusivity of Ni
in liquid Bi and consequently lead to a change in
the thickness of the interfacial intermetallics. How-
ever, the only interfacial reaction product was NiBi3
even though the reaction temperature was held at
480°C, slightly above 469°C at which NiBi3 melts
incongruently. Notably, NiBi, another stable com-
pound in the Ni-Bi system, was absent in the afore-
mentioned Ni(solid)-Bi(liquid) reaction. It was also
undetectable when the Ni-Bi diffusion couple was
held at 250°C13,14,18 but appeared at the Ni/NiBi3

(DMAHCl) solution prior to testing. The fluxed
specimen was soaked in the molten solder for the
desired duration. The immersion depth of the Cu
wires into the solder was 30 mm. The soaking
temperatures were kept constant at 350, 380, and
410C to study the reaction kinetics. After a certain
holding time, the tube was quenched in water. The
residual diameter of the wires was determined from
the residual cross-sectional area of the Cu wires
15 mm from the lower end. Each datum was the
average of three samples.
Single-lap specimens, as shown schematically in
Fig. 2, were used to investigate the shear proper-
ties. Pb-5wt.%Sn joints were also prepared for
comparison. A stainless-steel clamping apparatus
was used to fix two rods with a diameter of 3 mm.
The gap between the adjacent ends of the rods was
adjusted to be 0.3 mm. The rinsing and fluxing
procedures are shown above. A soldering tape was
also applied to prevent undesired reactions. The
clamped rods were sequentially dipped into a solder
bath (350C for 1 min) to produce a 0.3-mm-thick
solder joint. The cooling rate after soldering was
estimated to be about 8.6C/s. The shear tests were
carried out with the strain rate of 0.003 s-1. Each
datum was the average of more than five measure-
ments.
Microstructural characteristics of the specimens
were investigated by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA)
equipped with wavelength-dispersive spectrometers
(WDS).
RESULTS
Dissolution of Cu in Liquid Bi-Based Solders
The decrease in the radius of the Cu wires as a
function of the square root of the reaction time is
plotted in Fig. 3. According to the results, the radius
reduction first followed a parabolic relationship
with reaction time under all conditions (referred to
as the parabolic stage hereafter). Afterwards, the
amount of dissolution remained almost constant
(referred to as the steady stage), which usually im-
plies that the solubility limit of Cu in the liquid
solder has been reached. Take the dissolution data
at 350C as an example example (Fig. 3a); the slope
of the dissolution curve was drastically diminished
with the reaction time of 20 min for pure Bi and Bi-
2.5Ag. Interestingly, in the case of Bi-11Ag the time
for the slope change was prolonged to 40 min. The
same tendency could be observed at all the soaking
temperatures.
For comparison, Tables I and II list the dissolu-
tion rate of Cu in the first 10 min and the Cu con-
centration in the liquid solders in the steady stage,
which were calculated by dividing the Cu weight
loss (estimated from the radius reduction) into the
solder weight, at different temperatures. These re-
sults indicate that either a higher Ag content or a
higher reaction temperature result in faster sub-
strate dissolution. Similarly, the amount of dis-
solved Cu and consequent Cu concentration in
molten solders increased in turn from pure Bi,
Bi-2.5Ag to Bi-11Ag. Accordingly, it can be seen that
the solubility of Cu in Bi could be increased by
adding Ag and raising the reaction temperature.
Moreover, the natural logarithm of the dissolu-
tion rate against the reciprocal reaction time in the
first 10 min of the parabolic stage is plotted in
Fig. 4. The quotient of the straight slope and gas
constant represents the activation energy of disso-
lution. The activation energies for Cu dissolution
into the Bi-based solders investigated are very close:
17.14 kJ/mol for pure Bi, 17.76 kJ/mol for Bi-2.5Ag,
and 16.59 kJ/mol for Bi-11Ag, suggesting the same
dominant mechanism for Cu dissolution.
Microstructural Evolution During Long-Time
Soaking
Figure 5 illustrates the interfacial morphologies
of the Cu wires after soaking in liquid Bi and Bi-Ag
respectively, which show that instead of forming
IMC layers, GB grooving occurred at the solder/
substrate interface. Also, some gray particles or
needles of the newborn phase, indicated by the ar-
rows, could be observed within the solder in addi-
tion to Bi and Ag. The magnified structure in Fig. 6a
and b reveal that GB grooves appeared at pure
Bi/Cu and Bi-11Ag/Cu after a short period of soak-
ing at 350C for 10 min. A higher temperature and
extended reaction period resulted in a greater
degree of grooving and even GB penetration, as

tion was 56.3 at%Cu-39.2at.%Bi-4.5at.%Ag). By way
of comparison, Fig. 7a and c reveal that the amount
of Cu-Bi phase in Bi-11Ag solder was larger than
that in pure Bi.
Shear Strength and Fracture Surface of Joints
Figure 8 shows the shear strength of the joints
after 1 min of soldering at 350C. The average joint
shear strength in decreasing order was Bi-11Ag/Cu,
Bi-2.5Ag/Cu, and then Pb-5Sn/Cu. Although the
strength of the Bi-Ag/Cu samples was greater than
the Pb-5Sn/Cu samples, the data were spread over a
wider range. In addition, the fracture surfaces of the
three joint samples, Fig. 9, reveal that fracturing
almost occurred within the solder. The fracture
surface of the Pb-5Sn/Cu was more rugged than
those of the Bi-Ag/Cu. There were no interfacial
reaction layers or Cu substrate exposed.

interfaces at soldering temperatures ranging from
350C to 410C. The addition of Ag to liquid Bi and a
higher reaction temperature enhanced the GB
grooving behavior, which was strongly positively
correlated with the trend in the dissolution. This
implies that dissolution at GBs plays an important
role in the interfacial reaction between Cu and li-
quid Bi.
There are two mechanisms causing grain-bound-
ary grooves;8,9 the effect of surface tension when the
grain boundary energy (cGB) is more than two times
the solid–liquid interfacial energy (cSL), and the
greater dissolution rate at grain boundaries
(grooving rate) compared to flat surfaces. Joseph
et al. reported that no groove was observed along
the grain boundary when immersing Cu in pure Bi
melt. Conversely, Cu GB grooving occurs when the
liquid Bi contains a certain amount of Cu because
the grooving rate at grain boundaries would be
larger than the dissolution rate at the flat surface
due to the reduced solute concentration gradient in
the liquid.
In this study, GB grooving could be observed after
only a short period of soaking, as seen in Fig. 6a
and b. The whole process can be described schemat-
ically in Fig. 10. In the beginning, Cu atoms from
both the GBs and surface dissolved into molten Bi or
Bi-Ag alloys, Fig. 10a. Consequently, grooves started
to form at the GBs due to the reduced cs–c value.
When the solubility limit was reached, Fig. 10b, the
Cu-Bi phase precipitated and consumed Cu in the
liquid to some extent. Thus, the dissolution reaction
could still proceed. The parabolic kinetics suggesting
the diffusion control mechanism usually occurs in
the case of the reaction coupling with interfacial IMC
layer. Since there was no IMC formed at the interface
between Bi solders and Cu, it can deduced that the
dissolution process except for the very early stage
was controlled by the growth of Cu-Bi phase and how
fast it consumed Cu. The slope change in the disso-
lution curves from the parabolic stage to steady stage
may be ascribed to the GB penetration and thus
tunneling. As illustrated in Fig. 10c, molten Bi con-
tinued to penetrate along the Cu grain boundaries
and give rose to tunneling, deep and spread into the
Cu substrate, Fig. 6d. Those tunnels are more-rapid
dissolution paths and provided a great amount of Cu
atoms. Therefore, no more Cu dissolved from the flat
surface and thus the external diameter of the Cu
wires remained almost constant. This implies that
the dissolved amount of Cu was still underestimated
in Table II.
As already noted above, needle-like Cu-Bi and
spherical Cu-Bi-Ag formed, respectively, within the
pure Bi and Bi-Ag melts during soaking. The com-
position had a stoichiometric Cu/Bi ratio of about 3/
2 according to the WDS analytical results. Actually,
there is no such phase in the binary Cu-Bi phase
diagram. It is likely to be a metastable phase found
by Covington et al.,10 which forms through precipi-
tation from liquid Bi supersaturated with Cu. For
comparison, a Bi-11Ag-5Cu sample was prepared
through solidification from a temperature above
600C, of which the continuous cooling curve and
the microstructure were shown in Fig. 11. As illus-
trated, the Cu rich phase was identified as the pri-
mary Cu in the solidified structure, rather than the
Cu-Bi phase in the isothermally processed samples
shown in Fig. 7. Accordingly, it can be inferred that
the Cu-Bi phase was an isothermal reaction prod-
uct. Covington suggested that this compound could
not be regarded as stable phase since it can be
