Visible-light-driven silver vanadate photocatalysts were successfully synthesized 
using a low-temperature hydrothermal synthesis method. Under various hydrothermal 
conditions, the structures of silver vanadates were tuned by changing the hydrothermal 
time and with the assistance of a surfactant. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results reveal that 
the hydrothermal synthesis powders consisted of three kinds of phase: pure Ag4V2O7 or 
pure α-Ag3VO4 or mixed phases of Ag4V2O7 and α-Ag3VO4. UV-vis spectroscopy 
indicated that silver vanadate particles had strong visible light absorption with 
associated band gaps in the range of 2.2-2.5 eV. The powder synthesized at 140 ℃ for 4 
h (HT4) exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity among all samples. The reactivity 
of HT4 (surface area, 2.04 m2 g-1) on isopropanol and benzene was 16.6 times and 16.2 
times higher than those of P25 (surface area, 49.04 m2 g-1) under visible light irradiation. 
The enhanced photocatalytic activity of HT4 is attributed to mixed crystalline phases of 
Ag4V2O7 and α-Ag3VO4, where α-Ag3VO4 is the major component. In addition, the 
highest large amount of hydroxyl groups on the surface of α-Ag3VO4, detected by the 
in-situ FT-IR diffuse reflectance (DRIFT) technique, was considered as the other factor. 
Detailed DRIFT experiments also revealed that the stability of Brønsted acid sites of 
HT4 was excellent, as confirmed by NH3 adsorption. Studies of crystalline phase and 
surface property showed that the photocatalytic activities of the hydrothermal synthesis 
of silver vanadates are strongly affected by hydrothermal time. Besides, the amount of 
surface hydroxyl groups and the crystallinity of α-Ag3VO4 phase were verified to be the 
key factors influencing photocatalytic activity.

1. Introduction 
 Semiconductor photocatalysts have been studied extensively for environmental 
purification and for splitting water into H2 and O2. Among semiconductor 
photocatalysts, titanium dioxide is the most widely employed. However, titanium 
dioxide suffers from low efficiency under visible light illumination since it has a large 
band-gap energy of 3.2 eV. Therefore, numerous attempts have been made to improve 
TiO2 as a visible-light active photocatalyst, including anion doping, metal doping, and 
oxygen deficiency generation. Although the light absorption was extended to visible 
light region, these processes often suffered from thermal instability or involved an 
increase in the carrier-recombination centers [1-4]. These methods are not appropriate 
for developing highly efficient visible-light active photocatalysts.  
Recently, a band structure control method has been applied to design 
non-TiO2-based visible-light active photocatalysts, without any dopants. For example, 
monoclinic and perovskite materials, such as InMO4 (M = V, Nb, Ta) [5], BiVO4 [6], 
AgTaO3 [7], AgNbO3 [7], and Ag3VO4 [8], have been proven to be good visible-light 
responsive photocatalysts, especially in the field of photocatalytic splitting of water into 
H2 and O2. The valence bands of AgTaO3, AgNbO3, and Ag3VO4 consist of  
hybridized Ag 4d10 orbital and O 2p6 orbitals, and their conduction bands consist of 
hybridized Ag 5s orbitals with Ta 5d orbitals, Nb 4d orbitals, and V 3d orbitals, 
respectively. For these Ag-containing photocatalysts, the hybridization of the O 2p6 
orbitals with the completely filled 4d10 orbitals of silver ions could form a valence band 
at a more positive energy level than that of O 2p6, resulting in a narrowed band gap. The 
most general method for synthesizing monoclinic and perovskite semiconductors 
involves a solid-state reaction of high purity metal oxide powders, which need to be 
mechanically mixed and reacted at 850 ℃ (or higher) for at least 12 h. To reduce energy 
 
 
(20 ml) under constant stirring for 30 min. The pH of the mixture was adjusted to 7 
using ammonia solution. After the mixture was maintained at room temperature for 24 h, 
the suspended solution was poured into a 100 ml Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and 
heated at 140 ℃ for different hydrothermal times. These samples were denoted as HT2, 
HT4, HT6, and HT8, indicating the hydrothermal times of 2, 4, 6, and 8 h, respectively. 
After cooling to room temperature, the obtained light orange slurry was filtered, washed 
several times using distilled water to remove NO3− and NH4+ residues, and dried at 110 
℃ for 6 h.  
To prepare various morphologies of SVO, we used cetyltrimethylammonium 
bromide (CTAB, C19H49BrN) as the structure-directing agent. At a ratio of CTAB to 
silver of 0.05:1, AgNO3 and CTAB were dissolved in 180 ml of de-ionized water and 
stirred for 1 h, with the AgNO3 concentration kept at 0.03 M. Then, the transparent 
solution was added dropwise to 60 ml of 0.03 M NH4VO3 under continuous stirring, 
which was followed by the hydrothermal synthesis procedures. The resulting products 
were washed, first with water and then with absolute ethanol in 
centrifugation/dispersion cycles 3 times to remove the remaining CTAB, NO3−, and 
NH4+ residues. Finally, the material was dried in an oven at 100 ℃ for 6 h. The samples 
were denoted as CTAB-SVO. The other batch of SVO samples, prepared using a 
precipitation method and calcined at 380 ℃ for 4 h in air, was designated as PC.  
2.2. Sample characterization  
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the powders were measured using an 
X-ray diffractometer (Panalytical X’Pert PRO) with Cu radiation (λ= 0.15418 nm) in 
the 2θ-range from 10° to 60°. The surface morphology was examined using a Field 
Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (Hitachi S-3000N). Chemical properties of the 
catalyst surface were determined using a diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform 
 
 
composition of the effluent vapors. After degassing, the IPA or benzene vapor 
(concentration of ca. 160 ppmv) was introduced into the microreactor of the DRIFT at 
room temperature in the dark for 60 min. Then, the valve used to supply the VOC vapor 
was closed. For the batch test, another light source, generated by an LED lamp 
(NICHIA) with a wavelength ranging from 450-470 nm, was used. The visible light was 
illuminated toward the top of the DRIFTS cell by an optical cable. Its photon intensity 
was 4 mWcm−2 at 2 cm away from the tip of the wand. The spectra were recorded both 
in the dark and under illumination conditions. A constant amount of VOC vapor was 
periodically withdrawn from the sampling port and injected into the MS to determine 
the gas composition. A schematic diagram of an in situ micro-reactor, a diffuse 
reflectance accessory used to reflect the time evolution of infrared spectrum, and the 
supply of VOCs, is shown in Fig. 1. 
3. Results and discussion  
3.1. Characterization 
Powder XRD patterns of the catalysts prepared under various conditions are shown 
in Fig. 2. Characteristic peaks are indexed to the standard cards of Ag4V2O7 (JCPDS 
77-0097) and α-Ag3VO4 (JCPDS 43-0542). As can be seen, the hydrothermal synthesis 
samples have three kinds of XRD patterns, assigned to the pure Ag4V2O7, to the pure 
α-Ag3VO4, and to the mixed phases of Ag4V2O7 and α-Ag3VO4, respectively. The HT2 
and HT4 samples had mixed phases of Ag4V2O7 and α-Ag3VO4. When the 
hydrothermal time was increased to 6 h, the degree of α-Ag3VO4 crystalline increased, 
without any detectable Ag4V2O7. When the hydrothermal time was further increased to 
8 h, the longer hydrothermal time led to an increase in the diffraction intensities of the 
α-Ag3VO4 crystal. In contrast, the PC samples had fairly weak α-Ag3VO4 intensity. 
Well developed diffraction peaks of Ag4V2O7 are clearly visible for CTAB-SVO, 
indicating that the addition of CTAB might be favorable for the formation of Ag4V2O7 
 
 
All hydrothermal synthesis samples had an intense absorption in the visible light range. 
The spectra patterns of HT6 and HT8 were similar; the band gap absorption edge of 
HT6 was determined to be 550 nm and the value of band gap estimated by the onset 
point of the absorption curve was 2.2 eV. CTAB/SVO had a steep absorption edge in 
the visible light region, which was different from the absorbance spectra of HT4, which 
consisted of mixed structures of Ag4V2O7 and α-Ag3VO4. The value of the band gap for 
CTAB-SVO was found to be 2.5 eV, which is similar to the value reported by Konta et 
al. [8]. 
3.3. FT-IR spectral analyses 
The FT-IR spectra recorded from 400 to 1200 cm−1 at room temperature for 
hydrothermal synthesis samples are shown in Fig. 5. The absorption bands near 500, 
680, 862, 895, 920, and 965 cm−1 were observed in all hydrothermal synthesis samples. 
The absorption bands at 500 and 680 cm−1 correspond to the symmetric and asymmetric 
stretching vibrations of the V-O-V bridge of the V2O74- group [16], respectively. 
Moreover, the absorption bands at 862, 895, 920, and 965 cm-1 could be assigned to 
silver vanadates [17]. The bands near 920 and 965 cm-1 were attributed to the symmetric 
and asymmetric stretching vibrations of VO3 terminal groups of the pyrovanadate ions 
formed by the condensation of the VO43- tetrahedra [18]. It has been reported that peaks 
at 2918 and 2855 cm−1 correspond to -CH2 vibrations and that the peak at 1461 cm−1 
belongs to -CH2 bending or the scissor mode of the CTAB tail [19]. In this study, 2918, 
2855, and 1461 cm−1 peaks were not observed, indicating that there was no CTAB 
residue in the CTAB-SVO.  
3.4. Photocatalytic activity 
The specific surface areas of all samples are listed in Table 1. The surface area of 
HT samples decreased with increasing hydrothermal time, which is consistent with the 
 
 
(surface area, 49.04 m2 g-1) for IPA and 16.2 times higher for benzene. The 
hydrothermal synthesis samples had higher photocatalytic activities than those of PC 
and P25. Besides, the rate constant of HT6 was 2.4 (IPA) and 2.5 (benzene) times higher 
than that of CTAB-SVO for IPA and benzene, respectively. In comparison with HT4 
and HT6, it was found that the rate constant of the HT4 is larger than that of the HT6. 
However, HT4 had lower Ag3VO4 crystallinity than that of HT6, indicating that the 
crystalline phase is not the only key factor that determines the photocatalytic activity. 
However, Konta et al. [8] reported that among β-AgVO3, Ag4V2O7, and Ag3VO4 
compounds, only Ag3VO4 showed stronger photocatalytic activity under visible-light 
illumination, since the holes photogenerated in Ag3VO4 migrate to the reaction sites 
more easily than those of other silver vanadates. 
 It is well known that the availability of active sites plays a decisive role in 
photocatalytic activity. Therefore, properties like crystalline structure, density of OH 
groups, surface acidity, and adsorption/desorption characteristics are crucial to the 
photodecomposition of organic compounds. To investigate the adsorption/desorption 
characteristics, the in situ IR technique was used to measure the adsorbates under dark 
conditions and gaseous VOC during visible light illumination. Figure 6 shows the 
spectrum of adsorption of IPA and benzene at room temperature on HT4 samples in the 
dark for 60 min. The spectrum recorded upon adsorption of IPA at room temperature 
showed three peaks in the low wavenumber region in the range of 1500-1200 cm-1 
assigned to the δ(CH) mode of IPA; in the high wavenumber region, a very intense band 
at 2978 and a weak band at 2888 cm-1 were observed, corresponding to the stretching 
ν(CH) mode of methyl groups of IPA. A band at 3660 cm-1 can be assigned to the 
hydrogen bonded hydroxyl group of IPA or surface hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups. 
Interestingly, the intensities of C-H stretching and C-H bending bands reached a steady 
 
 
ascribed to hydrogen bonded O–H stretching vibration [26], triple coordination [27], 
ν(OH) of bridged hydroxyls with Brønsted acidity [28], and linear ν(OH) [29], 
respectively. The peak at 3550 cm-1 is assigned to the OH stretching vibration for 
molecularly adsorbed water since it coexists with the OH bending vibration at 1636 
cm-1. The amounts of various OH groups on the as-prepared samples could be obtained 
by integrating the seven individual curves, as shown in Table 2. The results show that 
HT4 had the highest integral amount of various OH groups among the as-prepared 
samples. Especially, HT 4 had a very intense hydrogen bonded O–H stretching 
vibration, high ν(OH) values of bridged hydroxyls with Brønsted acidity, and many OH 
groups chemically adsorbed compared to the cases of the other five samples.  
In addition, Figures 9(a) and (b) show that the photocatalytic activities of 
as-prepared silver vanadates are dependent on the amount of OH groups. The value of 
rate constant increases in the order of PC < CTAB-SVO < HT8 < HT6 < HT2 << HT4, 
which is consistent with the amount of OH groups. This tendency indicates that the 
intensity of surface hydroxyl groups of as-prepared samples is another significant factor 
that affects the photocatalytic activity. Comparing the value of rate constant with the 
number of OH groups, one can find that the value of the rate constant increases in the 
order of PC < CTAB-SVO < HT8 < HT6 < HT2 << HT4, which is the same order as the 
amounts of OH groups. This tendency indicates that the surface hydroxyl groups of 
as-prepared samples are another significant factor affecting photocatalytic activity. 
Based on the results of XRD and IR spectra of OH groups, the performance of 
photocatalytic activity of hydrothermal synthesis samples can be divided into two 
groups, one group being HT2 and HT4 and the other group being HT6, HT8, and 
CTAB-SVO. As listed in Table 1 and Fig. 2, HT4 consisted of mixed structures of 
Ag4V2O7 and α-Ag3VO4, with α-Ag3VO4 as the major phase, and had higher 
 
 
correlated with ammonia protonation on Brønsted acid sites, while the bands at 1425 
cm-1 and 1670 cm-1 are assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric deformation modes 
of ammonium ions (NH4+), respectively [32,33]. In addition, the band at 1605 cm-1 is 
assigned to the asymmetric deformation mode of ammonia species adsorbed on Lewis 
sites [32]. The spectra of the adsorbed ammonia on HT4 at 30 ℃ are shown in Fig. 10a. 
A band at 1425 cm-1, asymmetric NH4+ bending, was observed after saturation with 5% 
NH3 in N2 upon HT4 samples for 10 min. With increasing time, the adsorption amount 
of ammonia became larger. The stability of the adsorbed NH3 on the HT4 surface was 
further investigated, and the spectra of the desorption of ammonia shown in Fig. 10b. 
The intensities of the pre-adsorbed ammonia species decreased gradually upon heating. 
However, the peak of adsorbed ammonia was still observed for HT4 when the sample 
was heated at 250 ℃ for 30 min. This indicates that the stability of the NH3 adsorbed 
species on HT4 was good. The existence of Brønsted acidity of HT4 samples was 
confirmed.  
Generally, the acidity/basicity of a catalyst surface plays a crucial role in 
determining its catalytic activity. Figure 11 shows in situ DRIFTS spectra of NH3 
species adsorbed on as-prepared silver vanadates at 30 ℃ and 250 ℃, respectively. An 
intensive band at 1425 cm-1 was observed exclusively for HT4 samples, indicating that 
the largest amount of NH3 adsorption occurred on the HT4. However, the PC samples 
showed the least NH3 adsorption through the Brønsted acid sites. As a result, Figure 11 
indicates that the sample HT4 inherited the richest Brønsted acid sites, which verified 
that the intensity of Brønsted acidity of the catalysts is responsible for the catalytic 
activity.

EIGHTH ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION - DOE/NETL  May 4 – 7, 2009 
 
ABSTRACT 
Total CO2 emission in Taiwan at the year of 2007 had reached 268.8 Mtons, 
which accounted for around 1% of the world. About 60% of emitted CO2 can be 
attributed to the energy sector -- primarily from fire power plants burning fossil 
fuels. Greenhouse gases reduction has become an important issue in energy sector to 
cope with the emerging crisis of global warming, more specific, the coming shackles 
from punitive measures such as emission quotas or cap-and-trade mechanisms. 
Therefore the Bureau of Energy of Taiwan had started to sponsor a 3-years project 
to build up fundamental techniques of CO2 geological sequestration and to evaluate 
the preliminary potential of CO2 sequestration in Taiwan since the year of 2006. The 
goal of this project is to determine whether geological sequestration is a viable 
option for energy sector to reduce CO2 emission in a significant way. A preliminary 
assessment of geological sequestration potential for western Taiwan is underway. 
Complement field surveys including magnetotelluric and seismic reflections are also 
being conducted in the western Taiwan. Hopefully the integrated results will provide 
a basis for promoting a pilot-scale injection site for demonstrating geological 
sequestration in Taiwan. 
In addition to preliminary assessment of geological sequestration potential, we 
also invested resources for establishing numerical simulation capabilities including 
geochemical and transport modeling. Properties of representative caprock and 
reservoir have been collected from literatures and reports for simulating possible 
CO2/Rock/Brine interactions. A synthetic case for elaborating optimal sequestration 
depth in Taiwan had been developed. A simplified geological model for transport 
modeling was also developed for concept proofing for storing CO2 in aquifers 
beneath northwestern Taiwan.

represents the transition from passive-margin to foreland basin from late-Miocene to 
early Pliocene (Chiang, 2007) and can be subdivided into three members, that are, 
Kuandaoshan sandstone, Shiliufen shale, and Yutengping sandstone.   The east-
dipping sedimentary sequences of interbedded sandstones and shales will allow 
injected carbon dioxide to migrate laterally to the west (away from shoreline) and 
increase the amount of trapped carbon dioxide. Overlaid the Kuechulin formation is 
a regionally distributed shale formation -- Chinshui shale. The lower bound of the 
Chinshui shale in northwestern Taiwan is at around 800~1,000 meters, which is 
favorable for keeping injected carbon dioxide in super-critical status. Therefore the 
Chinshui shale can act as caprock once the carbon dioxide is injected into the 
Kueichilin formation. Beneath the Kueichulin formation is the Nanchuang formation 
which is also a suitable reservoir for geological sequestration. The top member of 
Nanchuang formation is Shangfuchi sandstone which is mainly composed of thick-
bedded or massive, medium to coarse-grain white sandstone.  
Besides, a series of complementary field surveys were conducted in the 
northwestern Taiwan for characterizing potential storage environment. Several 
seismic reflection profiles perpendicular and parallel to the coastline have revealed 
relatively undisturbed and slightly east-dipping formations. Regional distribution of 
caprock and reservoir matchings were identified using profiles based on 
magnetotelluric surveys. Combining seismic and magnetotelluric data, the final 
results have suggested that the area between Yungan and Houhu might be suitable 
for geological sequestration. The thickness of potential reservoir are in the range of 
600 to 1,000 meters and covered by massive Chinshui shale as caprock. To the north 
the depth of potential reservoir goes deeper which may increase the operation cost. 
To the south the potential reservoir was disturbed by regional structures that may 
compromise the safety of injection site. 
The geological setting of the southwestern Taiwan can be separated into three 
regions, i.e. Yunlin, Chiayi, and Tainan, separated by the B fault and Yichu fault. 
The seismicity and fault occurrence is relatively lower in the Yunlin region

geological sequestration, GCO2 = AxhxΦxρxE, which considered the area, thickness, 
porosity, density and efficiency factor. The scenario was to inject carbon dioxide 
along the coastline. The design of area parameters used for calculation are based on 
the basin shape and bounded by the territorial waters limit. The thickness of 
reservoirs were designed based on the thickness data synthesized from literatures 
and field survey data. Both porosity and density data are derived from literature 
reviews. The efficiency factor ranged from 0.1 to 0.4. All these parameters are given 
as simple probability distributions and the probability of resultant geological 
sequestration potential were obtained. The estimated potential ranged from 9 to 68 
billion tons according to the results by Monte Carlo simulation. 
 
Technology R&D for Geological Sequestration 
  
Apart from studying on the potential, ITRI is also developing related 
technologies essential to the deployment of geological sequestration, such as 
optimal sequestration depth estimation (Lin, 2008), geochemical modeling using 
Geochemist's  Workbench, transport modeling based on FEHM, and geological 
modeling based on GOCAD.  ITRI is also upgrading its existing capabilities on site 
investigation and monitoring techniques. An integrated framework will be built to 
facilitate the promotion and planning of a pilot injection project underway. 
ITRI has initiated a research framework on CCS technology funded by the 
Bureau of Energy, Taiwan. Since a promising storage potential of saline aquifer has 
been found by this study, a pilot injection site for concept proofing on geological 
storage is being considered  for near-term target due to its essentialness to large 
scale implementation of CCS. The pilot site will be a platform for technology R&D, 
international collaboration, and public outreach. Related monitoring and assessment 
technology will also be developed. The pilot site will also play an important role for 
increasing international visibility of Taiwan.
