Figure 1 TPR profiles for hydrogenation of 
Li3N under various heating rates. 
1. Introduction 
 The energy crisis from petroleum storage 
is one of the great challenges in the 21st century. 
Therefore, hydrogen has been increasingly 
developed and considered as a new and clean 
resource for future automotive or fuel cells 
applications. The studies of hydrogen 
production, hydrogen purification, hydrogen 
application, fuel cell and hydrogen storage have 
attracted much attention and been studied 
widely in academic and technologic fields. 
Li3N can theoretically store 10.4 wt% 
hydrogen and the hydrogen absorption reaction 
can be separated into two stages; at the first 
step, about 6.5 wt% of hydrogen can be 
absorbed at temperatures above 500 K and 
Li2NH and LiH is formed.1-3 The second step 
requires high temperature (above 670 K) to 
absorb the remaining 4 wt% hydrogen. The 
other LiH and LiNH2 are produced in this step. 
The promotion on hydrogenation kinetics of 
Li3N through addition of Pd-based alloy 
catalysts has been studied. Pd-based alloy can 
absorb hydrogen at room temperature. The 
addition of Pd-based alloy is expected to 
promote the hydrogenation of Li3N. The 
hydrogenation kinetics of modified Li3N 
samples can be elucidated in detail by the 
characterization of TPR. 
Some critical issues regarding Li3N such 
as the reversible hydrogen capacity,4,5 
avoidance of NH3 formation,6 and 
adsorption/desorption kinetics7 need to be 
promoted. Hu et al.8 reported that the 
pretreatment on Li-N can produce a surface 
layer of Li2O which may not only prevent the 
structure from sintering but also stabilize the 
L-N structure during cyclic hydrogenation/ 
dehydrogenation. TPR has provided an 
alternative way to detect the hydrogenation/ 
dehydrogenation kinetics.9 It has been reported 
that the amount of hydrogen absorption/ 
desorption could be precisely calculated from 
the experimental curves and areas. Furthermore, 
the exact reaction temperature could also be 
confirmed on the basis of the temperature 
profiles. 
2. Results and Discussion 
 The hydrogenation of pure Li3N at 
different hydrogenation rate (3, 5, or 7 K/min) 
was examined by TPR, as shown in Figure 1. 
The Ti was about 450 K. It is worth noting that 
two obvious hydrogen consumption peaks were 
only found for the sample heated in the rate of 
3 K/min. On raising the heating rate to 5 or 7 
K/min, the two hydrogen consumption peaks 
became a broad peak gradually. Therefore, all 
hydrogenation measurement of various sample 
in TPR was in the heating rate of 3 K/min. 
 Figure 2 shows the XRD patterns of 
various catalysts. For Pd nanoparticles, the 
peaks of (111), (200), (220), and (311) were 
found at 2θ = 40.1°, 46.7°, 68.1°, and 82.1°, 
respectively (JCPDS 46-1043). For Ni 
nanoparticles, the peaks of (111), (200), and 
(220) were found at 2θ = 44.5°, 51.8° and 
76.4°, respectively (JCPDS 04-0853). In the 
case of PdxNi100-x alloys, peaks were located 
those of Pd and Ni. The peaks located at 2θ = 
40° and 46° merge together into one broad 
peak when x is ≦ 50. This phenomenon may 
be owing to the particles size reduction caused 
by alloying of Ni or the existence of multiple 
Pd-Ni alloy compositions. Besides, some minor 
peaks located at about 33° and 61° were noted, 
suggesting that some Ni existed as NiB 
(JCPDS 06-0567 ) and /or Ni2B (JCPDS 
25-0576) in these Pd-Ni alloys. The Ni-B 
compounds may be formed due to the residuals 
B reacted with Ni during the reduction process 
by NaBH4.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 1 The hydrogen absorption areas, Ti, 
and Th in the TPR traces for various samples.
Figure 5 TPR traces of Li3N modified with 
Pd15Ni85 catalysts in various ratios. 
amount of hydrogen uptake was even higher 
than the pure Li3N. 
From Table 1 and Figure 5, it is obvious 
that the hydrogenation kinetics changed a lot 
for Li3N by the addition of Pd15Ni85 alloy 
catalyst. In the case of Li3N : Pd15Ni85 = 4:1, Ti 
decreased slightly from 450 K to 440 K and the 
Th also shifted to lower temperature, especially 
the third one, shifted from 770 K to 620 K 
compared to pure Li3N. The only drawback of 
the modification was the capacity of 
hydrogenation decreased to 55 % compared to 
that of Li3N, far from the target of the 
modification.  
Furthermore, in the case of Li3N : Pd15Ni85 
= 1:4, the Ti decreased from 450 K to 420 K, 
even lower than that of 1:1, which was 440 K. 
However, there was also a fantastic result in H2 
absorption area ratio. The hydrogen absorption 
of Li3N : Pd15Ni85 = 1:4 was 107 % compared 
to Li3N and was the highest value among all 
PdxNi100-x modified Li3N. This indicates that 
the ratio of Li3N and Pd15Ni85 affected its 
modification performance and the 
hydrogenation kinetics. With decreasing ratio 
of Li3N/Pd15Ni85, the amount of hydrogenation 
capacity increased and the Ti decreased. Hence, 
the hydrogenation kinetics could effectively be 
promoted not only by addition of Ni-rich alloy 
catalysts but also by changes of the 
Li3N/catalyst ratio. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.  Conclusions  
 The fundamental hydrogenation properties 
of unmodified and modified Li3N samples were 
investigated systematically by characterization 
of TPR. The Pd and PdNi alloy catalysts were 
introduced on pure Li3N to enhance the 
hydrogenation kinetics. The following 
conclusions have been obtained from this 
project: 
1. The hydrogenation curves by TPR 
measurements displayed that the Ti for Li3N 
was about 450 K and the Th were noted at 495 
and 575 K. A desorption peak found at 660 K 
indicated that the hydride formed was not 
stable. 
2. A heating rate of 3 K/min was used to 
measure the hydrogenation properties of 
various samples. The hydrogenation kinetics of 
Li3N was not promoted by Pd and Pd60Ni40 
modification. For the Pd15Ni85 modified Li3N, 
the Ti was 440 K due to the spill over of H2 
from Pd15Ni85 to Li3N. Although the amount of 
hydrogen absorption for the modified Li3N was 
only 69 %, the hydride formed was stabilized 
by the modification of alloy catalysts. No 
hydrogen desorption peak was observed at high
