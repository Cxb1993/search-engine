2. 目的
Intuitively, localized data dissemination in VSNs can be achieved by
implementing geocasting-based approaches, which are designed to deliver messages
to all interested peers within a geographical destination region. Although several data
forwarding approaches have been proposed [4], [6], [9], [11], [12], [14], [16], [18],
they are not specialized for VSN applications, and they do not consider the fact that,
in VSNs, the geocast destination region is usually centered at the event source.
To address this research gap, we propose a novel solution, called To-and-Fro
(TAF), for localized data dissemination in vehicular sensing networks. The TAF
scheme is an opportunistic network-based approach that does not require a fully
covered infrastructure-based network, and it is not necessary to maintain an
end-to-end path between the source and the destination. Specifically, the TAF scheme
follows a very simple rule: it only forwards messages to passing vehicles if they are
traveling in the opposite direction. Using a comprehensive set of simulations, we
evaluate the TAF scheme in terms of the spatial distribution, message population,
dissemination ratio, and load distribution. The results show that the scheme is simple,
practical, and very effective in preserving data sensed in the regions close to the event
source, thereby fulfilling the goal of localized data dissemination. Moreover, it is easy
to deploy, as long as the GPS information (i.e., the geographic position and the
movement direction) can be accessed by each vehicle in the network.
4. 結果與討論
To evaluate the performance of the proposed TAF scheme, we implemented it
and performed simulations in DTNSim2 [1], a Java-based opportunistic network
simulator. We assume there is only one source, which produces one new event every
60 seconds, and each event is valid for 300 seconds (i.e., Td = 300). Moreover, all
vehicles passing the source witness the events that have been initiated and have not
expired yet. We consider that two vehicles are moving in opposite directions if the
angle of their movement vectors is greater than 90o (i.e.,θ= 90o); otherwise, they are
moving in the same direction.
We evaluate two network scenarios: one is a 1,600 × 1,600 meter area, and the other
is a 900 × 900 meter area. The former scenario is based on a 5×5 grid topology, and
the latter was created by TIGER [3] based on a map of the Afton Oaks area in
Houston, Texas, as shown in Figure 2. We assume the event source is located at the
center of the network topology (indicated by the red point), and there are 12 vehicle
flows in the first scenario and 8 flows in the second one (indicated by the blue arrows).
Moreover, we set the inter-arrival time of the vehicles per flow as a constant Ta, and
assume that each vehicle leaves the area after it reaches the map boundary. The
vehicular traffic is then generated by a microscopic, space continuous and time
discrete traffic simulation tool called SUMO [2]. A network contact (i.e., a
communication opportunity between two vehicles) occurs if two vehicles are within
each other’s wireless transmissionrange, which is set to 100m in this study. Table I
details the properties of the two network scenarios, and Figure 3 shows the CDF
distribution of the number of network contacts made by each vehicle.
(a) Scenario 1 (b) Scenario 2
Figure 2. The topology of the evaluated network scenarios: (a) a 5x5 grid, and (b) a
map of the Afton Oaks area in Houston, Texas.
From the simulation results, shown in Figure 4, we observe that there are two phases
in the curve of the average dissemination distance: a linearly increasing phase, and a
convergence phase. For instance, in the first network scenario, the average distance
increases linearly in the first 160 seconds, and then converges to 390 meters; whereas,
in the second network scenario, the average distance increases linearly in the first 30
seconds, and then converges to 210 meters.
(a) Scenario 1 (b) Scenario 2
Figure 4. The average distance of message dissemination (with a standard deviation of
±1) over time.
Specifically, in the linearly increasing phase, because the event has only just
occurred, only a small number of vehicles are aware of it, and most of them witness
the event independently (i.e., rather than learning about it from other vehicles). Since
these ‘early witnesses’ are moving awayfrom the source, the average dissemination
distance increases linearly over time. Meanwhile, in the convergence phase, a
comparable number of vehicles, which are moving towards the source, learn about the
event from the ‘early witnesses’ asthey pass each other. As a result, the average
dissemination distance stops increasing and starts to converge to some point.
In the second network scenario, the linearly increasing phase is much shorter
than that of the first scenario, since the distance between the event source and its
closest intersection is much shorter than in the first scenario. Therefore, the early
witnesses have more opportunities to forward stored messages to the passing vehicles
in the second network scenario, which reduces the length of the linearly increasing
phase.
2). Evaluation II: Message Population
Next, we evaluate the distribution of the message population under the TAF
scheme in the two network scenarios. The message population is the average number
dissemination ratio decreases as the distance from the event increases; and, for any
distance, the dissemination ratio increases as the message lifetime increases (i.e., an
increasing proportion of nearby nodes become aware of the event over time). The
results confirm our intuition that the dissemination ratio increases over time and
decreases as the distance increases. Moreover, the dissemination ratio in the second
network scenario is higher than that in the first network scenario. Specifically, in the
second network scenario, when the message lifetime is 100 seconds, the
dissemination ratio is greater than 0.5 when the distance is less than 400 meters;
whereas the ratio fluctuates a great deal in the range 0.2 to 1 in the first network
scenario. This is because the vehicular traffic in the first scenario (i.e., the grid
topology) is too regular to provide sufficient network dynamics for the TAF scheme.
Fortunately, this problem hardly occurs in reality because of the diverse mobility of
vehicular traffic.

source.
4). Evaluation IV: Load Distribution
In the last set of simulations, we evaluate the load distribution of the TAF
scheme, i.e., the distribution of the number of messages carried per vehicle in the
network. Intuitively, the higher the load distribution (i.e., the more duplicates of the
message that exist in the network), the more resilient the data dissemination scheme
should be. However, on the downside, if the data dissemination scheme has a higher
load distribution, it consumes more storage space on each vehicle. Thus, it is more
likely to encounter the buffer overflow problem, especially when the vehicular
network is very dense and/or the number of simultaneous events is very large.
Figure 7 shows the simulation results of the proposed scheme for both network
scenarios. Note that, since the event source generates a new event every 60 seconds in
our simulations and each event is only valid for 300 seconds, the maximum number of

Localized data dissemination is a special case of geocasting, which is designed to
deliver messages to nodes within a geographical region. The destination region of
localized data dissemination is simply the area close to the message source.
Geocasting approaches can be categorized into the following three types based on
how messages are replicated and forwarded in the network: flooding-based
approaches, directed flooding-based approaches, and non-flooding-based approaches
[15]. Flooding-based approaches simply flood the network with messages (including
information about the geocast destination region), and each receiver broadcasts the
messages to its neighbors if it is within the specified destination region. The
approaches are simple and robust; however, they are not efficient because the location
information is not used to reduce the number of packets transmitted over the network.
Several directed flooding-based geocasting approaches have been proposed to
avoid the tremendous traffic overhead caused by flooding-based approaches. For
instance, Ko and Vaidya [11] proposed the Location Based Multicast (LBM)
approach, which determines a forwarding zone for each message based on the carried
geocast destination information, and only broadcasts the message to the forwarding
zone. The approach was extended in [18], which applied the concept of Voronoi
Diagrams to avoid the possible failures of the LBM approach (i.e., when the
forwarding zone is empty or partitioned). In addition, the GeoGRID approach,
proposed in [14], reduces the amount of redundant network traffic by partitioning the
network into several logical grids and only allows cross-grid message transmission
through the gateway nodes of the grids. In [4], [6], the authors propose creating a
network mesh and only allow message transmission to take place on one network path
in the mesh, even though there are multiple available paths.
Finally, non-flooding-based approaches use unicasting to forward messages to
the designated geocast destination regions. Once a message reaches its destination
region, the receiver broadcasts the message to all of its neighbors within the region.
For instance, in [16], Maihofer et al. propose using general unicast routing approaches
to forward messages to the destination area. Each node on the unicast forwarding path
checks whether it is in the geocast destination region. If it is in the destination region,
it stops unicast forwarding and starts flooding the region with the message; otherwise,
the node continues unicasting. Similarly, the GeoTORA approach [12] employs
TORA unicast routing [17] to forward messages to the destination geocast group, and
then broadcasts the messages to all members in the group. The GeoNode approach [9]
utilizes a GPS-enabled infrastructure network and splits the data dissemination
