Introduction 
  Due to the rapid development and growth of high-tech industries in Taiwan, the 
wastewaters discharged from those industries are significantly increased every year. 
Wafer material industry and LCD/LED industries are major producer of spent solvents 
into the wastewater. In addition, the wastewater discharge from the high-tech industry 
is potential threatening and risk to our environment. Moreover it is highly complex in 
nature and used for various process such as, oxidation, doping, photolithography, 
etching, stripping, dicing, metallization, planarization, and cleaning, etc [1-3]. The 
wastewater generated in the semiconductor manufacturing process may contain 
non-halogenated solvents, acids, bases, salts and other organic compounds. IPA is 
extensively used in various stages of wafer surface washing and cleaning. It can cause 
toxicity by ingestion, inhalation, or absorption. AOP processes have been used to treat 
recalcitrant organic pollutants in aqueous media. AOPs have considerable similarities 
due to the participation of hydroxyl radicals which is highly reactive towards target 
organics. Thus, the objective of the current study is to use ozone-based advanced 
oxidation processes for the destruction of IPA in simulated wastewater and to compare 
the decomposition, mineralization efficiency of five AOPs, including O3, O3/UV, and 
H2O2/O3 processes at different pHs. In addition, its degradation intermediates was 
also identified. 
  On the other hand, to establish the kinetic of the reaction of ozone with IPA and to 
predict its reactions pathway is relatively important by providing another promising 
treatment alternative. During the ozonation process, ozone gas is usually brought into 
continuous contact with water under dynamic conditions. Since mass transfer of 
ozone is generally the rate-determining-step concerning the mechanisms of ozone 
reaction, factors including water qualities and operational parameters affecting mass 
transfer should be examined. The mass transfer rate is mainly influenced by the 
operating variables such as pH, temperature, agitation speed, and gas flow rate. Thus, 
another objective of this study was to determine the mass transfer coefficients, 
decomposition rate, and solubility of ozone. Besides, the rate constants for the single 
reactions of IPA with both oxidants-ozone and OH radicals-in ultra-pure water was 
substantially set up. Then, these kinetic rate constants have been successfully used to 
model and predict the oxidation kinetics of IPA during ozone and ozone/UV 
processes.

2.3 Advanced Oxidation Processes 
  The goal of any AOP design is to utilize and maximize the oxidizing potential of 
the hydroxyl radical which is one of the most reactive intermediate chemical species 
known [6]. This fact is shown in Table 2.1, which compares the relative oxidation 
potentials of several chemical oxidizers. The hydroxyl radical typically attacks 
organic species by abstracting a hydrogen atom or by adding to the double bond of 
unsaturated molecules.

Hydroxyl radical production includes photolytic, alkaline (high pH), and 
ozone–hydrogen peroxide reactions [7]. The hydroxyl radical can be consumed by 
reacting with the contaminant, inorganic constituents present in the influent matrix, 
and/or the parent oxidizers themselves. All reactions that do not result in the 
degradation of the contaminant are called scavenging reactions. Mineral scavengers 
(bicarbonates, carbonates, etc.) present in many influents can drastically reduce the 
efficiency of pollutant oxidation in direct proportion to their concentrations via the 
reactions [8]:

3. Materials and methods 
  There are two phases being included in this research to study the oxidation 
behavior and mechanisms of isopropyl alcohol using several kinds of AOPs. In the 
first phase, IPA initial concentration was fixed at 1000 mg/L and the AOPs used in the 
experiment included O3/UV, H2O2/UV, O3/H2O2, and O3/H2O2/UV. Quantitative 
determination for IPA and intermediate byproducts during the degradation course was 
carried out at different oxidant dosages and pH conditions. In the second phase, ozone 
mass-transfer model was performed in the aqueous solution. In the meantime, the 
oxidation kinetics for IPA using ozone and ozone/UV processes was determined 
respectively. Then a dynamic model incorporating with mass transfer and chemical 
reaction kinetics was developed to successfully predict the decomposition of IPA and 
production of acetone that is the primary product after IPA oxidation. Different pHs at 
3 and 7 were evaluated to obtain the system parameters required for concentration 
prediction and calibration in the model. As seen in Fig. 3.1, it illustrates the whole 
flowchart in this study.

3.1 Phase I 
3.1.1 Reactor configuration 
  Figure. 3.2 shows schematic representation of the apparatus used in this study. The 
experiment was performed using a batch reactor which made of Pyrex glass. Ozone 
gas was generated from corona discharge using an ozone generator (Model RXO-5, 
Ozonair), which produced an ozone concentration of ca. 5~6 % (by weight) in the 
oxygen enriched gas stream. The flow rate of ozone stream was controlled by a 
mass-flow controller (Model 5850E, Brooks). In this reactor, a fritted gas diffuser was 
used which generate fine bubbles. The concentration of gaseous ozone was monitored 
using an UV spectrophotometer (Genesys 5, Spectronic Inc.) The experimental 
solution was prepared by adjusting the initial IPA concentration equal to 1000 mg/l.  
Samples were withdrawn at regular interval for quantitative analysis. In UV/O3 
process, low-pressure mercury lamp (pen-ray) was used for irradiation and the 
intensity of the lamp is 5.5 mW/cm2.

from a thermostatic water bath. The concentrations of gaseous ozone were monitored 
using an UV spectrophotometer (Genesys 5, Spectronic Inc.) by passing ozone gas, 
from both the inlet and outlet, through one 2 mm and another 10 mm flow cells. The 
concentration of ozone was also determined spectrophotometrically and absorbance of 
the ozone was monitored at the wavelength 254 nm. In this case, the liquid was 
measured through a dissolved ozone detector (MOCA 3600, Orbisphere). Before 
initiating each experiment, a three-way valve was used to by pass the inlet ozone into 
a potassium iodine solution (trap) until it was observed that the inlet concentration 
was constant. When a desired concentration of inlet ozone was obtained, the run was 
started by rotating this valve and admitting ozone in enriched-oxygen into the reactor. 
During the run, the ozone absorbance in the inlet and outlet gas streams and in the 
liquid stream was monitored continuously at thirty-second intervals. Then, the ozone 
mass-transfer parameters were determined from ozone process alone or combined 
O3/UV in this system.  IPA and its byproducts concentrations were measured by 
withdrawing samples at regular intervals at different pHs.

3.2.2 Experimental and analytical Procedures 
For a standard reaction run, 5 L of aqueous solution was used. It was prepared by 
adjusting the initial IPA concentration equal to 1000 mg/l. The experiment was 
performed by ozone and ozone/UV processes, and samples were withdrawn to

time in ozonation process. Like IPA decomposition, maximum TOC removal is noted 
at pH 7. After 180 minutes of reaction course, approximately 20%, 39%, 12% of TOC 
removal was observed at pH 3, 7, and 10, respectively. As we discussed before, 
carbonate and bicarbonate formation retarded the removal efficiency at pH 10. Thus, 
low TOC removal rate has been observed. In conclusion, IPA decomposition and its 
TOC removal efficiency is the most efficient at pH 7. 
  It was reported that ozone in the presence of UV light enhances the decomposition 
rate of pollutants present in wastewater. Therefore, in order to accelerate the IPA 
decomposition and its TOC removal, the reaction has been performed similar to 
ozonation process at all these three pHs under the UV light irradiation and the results 
are presented in Fig.4.2 a. Obviously, the removal efficiency of UV/O3 process is 
much profound than ozonation process alone. Like ozonation process, IPA 
decomposition and its TOC removal is efficient at pH 7. About 46%, 65%, 60% of 
decomposition was noted after 15 minutes of reaction time. As shown in Fig.4.2 b, the 
TOC removal efficiency order is pH 7 > pH 3 > pH 10. The IPA degradation and its 
TOC removal efficiency has been compared with ozonation process at 15 minutes and 
180 minutes respectively, 11%, 15%, 28% of IPA decomposition and 20%, 23%, 0% 
of TOC removal enhancement was observed over ozonation process alone. It is 
interesting to note that no TOC enhancement is observed at pH 10 over ozonation 
process, which might be due to hydroxyl scavenging effect.  This enhancement of 
degradation rate is due to the abundant generation of hydroxyl radicals in the presence 
of UV light. Ozone absorbed UV radiation and produced hydrogen peroxide [12] and 
photolysis of hydrogen peroxide can generate hydroxyl radicals. In addition, hydrogen 
peroxide accelerated the ozone decomposition into OH radicals [13]. Therefore, OH 
radicals constituted an important active species in the photolytic ozonation process.

4.1.2 H2O2/O3 Process 
  The operating conditions for achieving maximum efficiency could be given as 
optimum ratio between ozone and hydrogen peroxide concentration. Generally, some 
authors found that ratio between H2O2 and O3 of 0.2~1 g/g was the optimum dosage 
for efficient removal [14, 15]. Thus, three different H2O2:O3 ratios were selected to 
determine the optimum ratio for effective IPA removal at all three pHs. Fig.4.3 a, 4.4 a,

4.1.3 Product Formation and Identification during IPA Oxidation 
  IPA degradation intermediates has been analyzed in all AOP processes and the 
degradation products were identified and quantified using appropriate analytical 
techniques. Although IPA degradation intermediates are noted in all AOP processes, a 
representative IPA degradation intermediates in ozonation process at pH 3, 7, and 10 
are reported in the Fig. 4.6 a, b and c, respectively. All these reactions were performed 
at 500 mg/l of IPA initial concentrations. The major organic byproducts identified 
were acetone, formic acid, acetic acid, and oxalic acid. The results clearly indicated 
that both hydroxyl radical and ozone induced degradation pathways are similar. The 
system of IPA with O3 treatment process gives similar products at pH of 3, 7, and 10, 
but with different proportions which imply that IPA degradation mechanism precedes 
common mechanism at all pHs. At pH 7 and 10, IPA was completely degraded within 
90 min and formic acid was not detected until 90 min, probably because of its rapid 
reaction with ·OH which gives ·COO−. This radical then reacts with ·OH to ultimately 
form CO2 [16, 17]. Based on the identification of intermediates products, it was 
postulated a possible pathway for the mineralization of IPA as shown in scheme 1 
according to our experimental results and literature reviews [18].

4.2 Phase II 
4.2.1 Self-Decomposition of Ozone in Water 
  The order and rate of the decomposition of dissolved ozone were determined by 
observing the reduction in the ozone concentration with buffered DDI water at pH of 
3 and 7. Investigations of its decomposition in natural waters from several European 
locations had shown that this reaction follows first-order kinetics [19]. Accordingly, 
the integrated ozone decomposition rate could be represented by the following 
equation: 
[ ]
[ ] t-O
O
ln
03
3
dk=     (1) 
Where kd was the first-order rate constant for this ozone decomposition. Fig. 4.7 & 4.8 
shows the rate of ozone decomposition in buffered DDI water at pH of 3, 7 both 
occurred via a first order reaction. Table 4.1 indicated the rate of ozone decomposition 
at pH 3 was lower than pH 7, because at acidic media the concentration of dissolved 
ozone decreased quite slowly and it was too less hydroxyl ion to react with ozone then 
produced hydroxyl radical. In addition, the m value could be fitted using Eq. (1) that 
was first order and m is self-decomposition order of dissolved ozone.

The relations between pH values, KLa of ozone, and saturated ozone concentration 
were examined. The mass-transfer coefficient, KLa, could be calculated from Fig. 4.9 
& 4.10 at pH of 3 and 7. As shown in Table 4.3, the KLa values seem to be increased 
with the increase of pH. These results might be explained by the following chemical 
reactions.in aqueous phase:

From the above reactions, it is demonstrated that O3 reacts with OH-. Consequently, 
the enhancement factor would be involved in the mass-transfer coefficient. The 
partition coefficient for ozone was reported to be 0.49, and 0.39 at pH 3 and 7, 
respectively. The α value obtained in this study is relatively large compared with the 
report by Laity et al. It is probably due to the use of venturri injector, in which many 
fine gas bubbles are produced under high speed and low pressure condition. Thus, the 
equilibrium dissolved ozone concentration would be increased significantly. When pH 
value was increased from 3 to 7, the α value would be also increased. This can be 
explained by the Henry’s constant (He in atmosphere) is calculated by means of the 
correlation proposed by Sullivan. This correlation takes into account pH effect on 
ozone solubility by means of hydroxide ions concentration [OH-] expressed in mol/l.  
If the solution has more hydroxide ions, the equilibrium concentration of dissolved 
ozone will become small. Therefore, the α value at pH 3 is bigger than pH 7, due to 
less concentration of hydroxide ions.

Table 4.4, the enhancement factor in ozone mass transfer due to UV light for different 
pHs of 3 and 7 are almost identical. Besides, the kr value is a rate constant for ozone 
decomposed by UV light. Probably the most important concept in photochemical 
kinetics is quantum yield, ΦUV. It is defined as the efficiency of the photochemical

4.2.3 Kinetic study 
  The determination of the OH radical concentrations was such a complicated thing 
because there was no easy method for measuring their concentration in situ. Several 
indirect methods could be found in the literature that used computer simulations and 
predicted the OH radical concentrations from the ozone decomposition [21]. However, 
because of the complexity of the organic and inorganic matrix of natural waters such 
as those of the present research, even well established models fail to adequately 
predict OH radical concentrations. One proposal was the experimental approach 
proposed by [22], who designed to measure the transient concentrations of both the 
OH radical and O3 during an ozonation process. The method was based upon the 
measurements of decrease of an ozone-resistant reference compound that reacts 
rapidly with OH radicals. Thus, in our study, the compound selected was IPA, which 
fulfills those requirements: its rate constant with OH radicals is 3.1×109 L/(mol．s). To 
evaluate the importance of ozone and OH reactions, a new parameter, the Rct value, 
had been defined as the ratio of the exposures of ·OH and O3 (i.e., concentration of 
oxidant integrated over the reaction time) [22]:

  The model incorporating with mass transfer and chemical oxidation kinetics was 
developed to predict the accumulation of dissolved ozone concentration and the

for ozone in DDI water were employed. The parameters regarding to the 
stoichiometric factors, enhancement factor, and rate constants for the reaction of 
ozone with IPA and acetone are summarized in Table 4.6. which indicates the

found the Rct value in O3/UV process was 40 times greater than O3 process due to 
more OH radicals was produced. For this reason, the degradation of IPA in Model I 
was faster in O3/UV process than O3 process. Then, the reaction coefficients were also 
compared. The reaction coefficients (kf) towards with other byproducts are much 
larger in O3/UV process than that found in O3 process alone, indicating that more 
unselective radical reactions are happened with the minor byproducts in the system.

5.Conclusions 
  The combination of various AOPs for the degradation of IPA was investigated in a 
semi-batch reactor. About 11%, 15%, 28% of IPA decomposition and 20%, 23%, 0% 
of TOC removal enhancement is observed in O3/UV process over ozonation process at 
pH 3, 7, and 10, respectively. H2O2/UV process is found to have better oxidation 
ability on IPA degradation at acidic pH. About 82%, 60% and 30% of IPA degradation 
is noted at pH 3, pH 7, and pH 10 at 180 minutes respectively. The IPA degradation 
efficiency order differs from other ozone based AOP processes. IPA degradation and 
its TOC mineralization efficiency is in the following order: H2O2/O3/UV > H2O2/O3 > 
O3/UV > O3 H2O2/UV at pH 7. Acetone was identified as a primary degradation 
intermediates, whereas acetic acid, oxalic acid, and formic acids were identified as 
secondary intermediates in all AOP processes at acidic, neutral, and basic pHs with 
different proportions. Then, the combination of a mass transfer and kinetic study has 
led to the development of a model to successfully predict the degradation of IPA and 
its main byproduct of acetone formation in ozone and ozone/UV processes. In this 
study, several important conclusions have been drawn.  
1. The self-decomposition of ozone in buffered water at pH of 3 and 7 follows a 
first order kinetic model at 25 °C. It is apparent that the rate of ozone decomposition 
at pH 3 is significantly lower than pH 7.  
2. The mass-transfer coefficient increases with increasing pH value. The effect of 
pH on the mass-transfer coefficient can be explained by chemical reaction in the 
ozone system including self-decomposition and its reaction with hydroxyl ion in 
solution. Therefore, the enhancement factor caused by ozone reaction with hydroxyl 
ion at pH 7 is still significant.  
3. The factors, such as partition coefficient and UV quantum yield, are found to be 
related with pH. If pH increases, the concentration of ozone will be dramatically 
consumed by hydroxyl ions. Therefore, the values of partition coefficient and 
quantum yield are less at pH 7 than pH 3.  
4. An integrated model, combining with mass transfer and oxidation kinetics in O3 
and O3/UV processes, should consider the side reactions involving ozone or hydroxyl 
radicals. Using Model I, which ignores the effect of side reactions, the predicted rates 
of the oxidation of IPA and its main byproducts of acetone are much greater than 
those observed experimentally. The reaction coefficient for IPA was estimated at pH 
3 and 7 as 0.008 and 0.0236 in O3 process, 1.4931 and 1.4909 in O3/UV processes, 
respectively. The larger reaction coefficient found in ozone/UV system indicates more 
competing mechanisms for hydroxyl radicals happens in such complex reaction 
system.

Abstract: 
 
A new, novel, efficient, and stable green catalyst (sludge powder) has been 
successfully used as a catalyst in aqueous ozone decomposition in acidic medium.  
The catalyst was characterized by using X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), Transmission 
Electron Microscope (TEM), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), and X-Ray 
Diffraction (XRD) techniques.  The sludge mainly consists of various metal and 
non-metal oxides. The effect of various experimental parameters such as catalyst 
loading, initial ozone concentrations, and various metal oxide catalysts on the 
decomposition was investigated. The decomposition of dissolved ozone was 
substantially enhanced by increasing the catalyst loading from 125 to 750 mg and by 
increasing the initial ozone concentration. The ozone decomposition efficiencies of 
Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, Fe2O3,  ZnO and sludge have been studied and the efficiencies of 
these catalysts were found to be in the following order:  ZnO ≈ sludge > TiO2 > SiO2 
> Al2O3 ≈ Fe2O3.  The catalytic stability was also investigated up to four successive 
cycles and found that the catalyst was stable and ozone did not affect the catalyst 
morphology and its composition. However, the surface area of the catalyst increases 
after 1st cycle then it becomes stable. Catalytic ozonation has been carried out using 
p-chloro benzoic acid (p-CBA) and N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) as model pollutants. 
It was concluded that sludge powder was a promising catalyst for the aqueous ozone 
decomposition and in catalytic ozonation process. 
 
Keywords: ozone, sludge powder, heterogeneous catalyst, green catalyst, catalytic 
stability, catalytic ozonation. 
 
 
of ozone decomposition on these catalysts, the conclusions of these studies show 
many discrepancies. The use of activated carbon is simple and not expensive, but they 
have low mechanical strength. Therefore, the necessity for the design and testing of 
innovative, cheap reusable environmental friendly catalysts to abate higher 
concentrations of ozone should be warranted. In light of the above points, we try to 
develop a new type of catalyst derived from sludge waste materials for such 
applications. To the best of our knowledge, no reports are available in literature using 
sludge powder as catalysts in aqueous ozone decomposition.  The main objectives of 
this work were (1) to test the aqueous ozone decomposition ability of powdered 
sludge obtained from water treatment plants (2) to study the effect of various 
experimental parameters on the decomposition (3) to compare the catalytic 
efficiencies with the commercially available metal oxide catalysts (4) to investigate 
the reusability and surface morphology of the catalyst before and after usage (5) to 
test the sludge catalytic ability in catalytic ozonation process. 
 
2. Experimental Methods. 
2.1. Material  
Sludge sample was collected from Feng Yuan water treatment plant in 
Taichung Taiwan and alum was used as a coagulant.  The particle size is varied from 
50-100 nm determined by TEM. Other characteristics are, pH (in H2O) 6.76 (± 0.08), 
combustion content 2.72% (±0.10) and ash content 46.11% (± 0.24) were measured 
by appropriate analytical methods. All other chemicals α-Al2O3 (purity 99.9), SiO2 
(purity 99%) SHOWA chemical Ltd., Japan; TiO2 (purity 99%), FERAK Germany; 
ZnO (purity 99.86%), TEDIA, USA, used as received and the particle size of these 
catalysts measured by TEM were  50-100 nm, 100-500 nm, 50-100 nm, and 50-100 
nm, respectively.  For all experimental work, deionized water Milli q-Plus, 
resistance equal to 18.2 M Ώ, was used. Due to the instability of ozone at neutral or 
alkaline solution, the solution pH was selected and maintained at 3.0 ± 0.1 throughout 
the experiments and adjusted by using 0.1 N HClO4. 
 
2.2. Methods 
The experimental suspension was ozonated in unbuffered Milli-Q Plus at a pH 
of 3.0 ± 0.1. The ozone decomposition reaction in ozonated aqueous solution at 
before and after use was elucidated by energy dispersive spectra.  Elemental analysis 
was carried out using Vario EL III CHNOS elemental analyzer (Germany). UV 
spectral analysis was carried out using Spectronics Genesys 5 spectrophotometer. 
 
3. Results and discussion  
3.1 Characterization of sludge   
  X-ray fluorescence analysis showed that sludge contains many metal and non- 
metal oxides present in various proportions. Among these oxides about 53.36%, 
21.01% and 15.28% are SiO2, Fe2O3, and Al2O3, respectively. A small amount of 
other oxides such as TiO2 (1.38%), CaO (1.20%), P2O5 (0.83%), MnO (0.73%) and 
SO3 (0.50%) are also present. The presence of these metal oxides is also confirmed by 
XRD analysis and the results are presented in figure 1. The XRD pattern of the 
catalyst is analyzed and compared according to XRD standard data base library 
JCPDS card. The morphology of the sludge is analyzed using SEM at different 
magnification. Fig.2a depicts SEM figure of sludge at magnification of 900 and 
revealed that a large number of external pores with non- uniform surfaces. At higher 
magnification 8 k showed that irregular distribution of these metal oxides (SEM 
figure 2b). 
 
3.2 Effect of operational parameters   
 
 The optimum amount of catalyst has to be added in order to avoid excess catalyst 
in catalyzed reactions. The aqueous ozone decomposition experiments were 
performed at various catalyst concentrations to determine the role of sludge as a 
catalyst.  Figure 3.a depicts the effect of catalyst loading (125-750 mg / 2.2 mg/l of 
ozone) on the ozone decomposition as a function of reaction time at pH 3. About 30% 
self-decomposition of ozone is observed after 10 minutes under similar catalytic 
experimental conditions. Increase in the catalyst loading from 125 to 750 mg 
promotes the decomposition efficiency from 50.9 to 96.2% at the time of 10 minutes 
which demonstrating the effectiveness of sludge as a catalyst in reaction. The 
decomposition rate of ozone at the various sludge concentrations was found to be 
linearly related with the ozone decomposition rate, because the increased amount of 
sludge provides more active sites for ozone adsorption and decomposition. Our results 
are good agreement with earlier reports on ozone decomposition [21, 22]. when the 
each process, the catalyst is easily removed from the reactor then washed gently with 
deionized water (18.2 M Ώ). The washed catalysts are dried in atmospheric condition 
and in an oven at 100 ºC for 30 minutes to remove molecular water present on the 
surface of the catalysts. Ozone decomposition results of the recovered catalysts are 
shown in figure 4b. After 10 minutes of reaction course, 78.7%, 83.4%, 77.5%, and 
85.8% of decomposition is noted in four successive cycles respectively. The 
decomposition efficiencies are slightly increased in the second and fourth cycles. This 
may be due to the increase the surface area of the catalyst after the first cycle, which 
is favorable for more decomposition. Moreover, no obvious decrease in the ozone 
decomposition efficiency is observed in four successive usages.  Our results are in 
agreement with literature reports [19, 27]. These results indicate that the catalyst has 
an excellent long-term stability. The excellent stability of the catalytic activity could 
be attributed to the stable structure of the catalyst, which is confirmed, by the SEM, 
XRD, EDX measurements. The catalytic stability of the catalyst is tested by XRD 
after the fourth run and compared with unused catalysts and no difference between the 
two patterns, indicating that no obvious change occurred during the catalytic reaction. 
The morphology observed in SEM photograph also seems to be similar before and 
after treatment (both XRD and SEM photographs are not provided in the figures).  
EDX measurements showed that the catalyst composition is not uniform on the 
catalyst and hence we measured at least three different places on the catalyst surface.  
SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3 are the major content of the sludge and hence its atomic 
composition of these elements are shown in table 1. As can be seen from the table, no 
significant change in the element content was observed. However, a slightly lower 
value of Al and Fe content was observed after 4th cycle and moreover it did not affect 
the catalytic activity. Elemental analysis showed that the carbon content of the 
catalyst is decreased in successive use. Table.1 also shows details of surface area, 
pore volume and median pore width of used and unused catalysts in each cycle. It is 
interesting to note that ozone decomposition on the catalyst surface increases surface 
area after 1st cycle and then becomes stable after two consecutive cycles and slightly 
decreases in 3rd and 4th cycle. But pore volume and median pore width was not 
affected in all cycles.  This increase in surface area of the catalyst after the 1st cycle 
may be due to the oxidation of surface bound impurities. As evidence from the table, 
there is no obvious decrease on the catalytic surface properties and its composition. In 
that the catalyst is stable and retains its catalytic activity up to four successive cycles. 
The SEM, XRD, EDX, and elemental analysis of unused and used catalysts also 
confirmed the stability of the catalyst. About 13% and 17% of enhancement was 
observed in p-CBA, NMP degradation in sludge catalytic ozonation process 
respectively, over ozonation process. This catalyst can be used as an alternative for 
the cost-effective catalyst used in ozone decomposition process. In conclusion, sludge 
powder catalyst is an efficient, potential, and reusable green catalyst for industrial 
ozone abatement in aqueous medium and in catalytic ozonation process.
