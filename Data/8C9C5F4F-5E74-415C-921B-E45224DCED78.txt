英文摘要 
This exciting result motivates a 
substantial effort to fabricate solar cells out of 
the InGaN material system. Thus, in this 
proposal, we develop about utilizing 
single 1x xIn Ga N−  hetero-junction, different 
anti-reflection materials, optimal electrode 
design and multi- 1x xIn Ga N−  hetero-junction 
to form the solar cell device in two years. So 
the research includes two parts. (1) Adjust the 
indium composition to fabricate InN and 
InGaN in the range of 0.7 to 3.5 eV, and to 
fabricate full devices, using the epitaxially 
laterally overgrowth (ELOG) 1x xIn Ga N−  on 
Si substrate. (2) The development of 
multi- 1x xIn Ga N−  hetero-junction structure, 
including tunnel junctions. In addition, we 
predict that InGaN-based electronics will 
show extraordinary radiation hardness and 
will be useful for a wide range of functions in 
high radiation applications. 
Keywords: InGaN; hetero-junction; epitaxially 
laterally overgrowth (ELOG); 
二、研究目的 
於本計畫所提之氮化銦鎵 1( )x xIn Ga N−
合金半導體材料的能隙變化目前已被證
實，可依調變銦含量之大小(x)乃從 0.77 
eV 變化至 3.42 eV 左右(即 InN 能隙至
GaN 能隙間之大小範圍)，也可以用下面
之 簡 式
g x 1 x g gE (In Ga N) xE (InN) (1 x)E (GaN) bx(1 x)− ≅ + − − −
算出其大約之能隙大小，其中典型能隙
gE (InN) 0.77 eV= ， gE (GaN) 3.42 eV= 與參數
b 1.43 eV≈ [2]，因此只要適當調變銦含量
(x)之大小，所製備之太陽能電池必可剛
好匹配從 0.51 到 3.01 eV 的太陽光光譜，
然依目前主持人實驗室而言，高銦含量
(>0.5)之多層量子井結構非常不易製得
成功，最主要是 1x xIn Ga N− 薄膜間應力所產
生之缺陷效應。此外， 1x xIn Ga N− 材料之所
以能成為本計畫所提之高效能太陽能電
池之主要材料，乃其具有良好的抗紫外

五、結論 
本研究藉由傳統微影製程技術、成功
地使用 RTCVD 及 MOCVD 系統以製備
1−x xIn Ga N 系列之 p MQW(i) n+− − 太陽能
電池。發現有不錯之光電轉換效率，預
期於未來太陽能電池的應用上將極具
潛力，同時也發現不少問題如下： 
1.在「沉積不同材料之緩衝層」方
面，由於 SiCN 與 InN 薄膜摻雜 n 或 p
型離子之反應機制至今仍未明朗，其
中 n 型之 SiCN 與 InN 薄膜，則分別
使用 PH3 與 SiH4 反應氣體，反之 p 型
之 SiCN 與 InN 薄膜，則分別使用 B2H6
與 Cp2Mg 反應氣體，大部分是被列為
危險管制之氣體，購置非常不易，使
用時必須非常注意其安全性，本計畫
執行過程中將部分製程將至遠東光
電中心和翔成光電廠合作，並同時探
討不同離子摻雜量對各層薄膜品質
之影響程度，是否會因摻雜量而導致
各層薄膜間應力增加等問題。 
2. 在「串聯式多接面太陽電池」方
面，為了確保每一接面之吸光效率一
致，銦含含量大小與 InxGa1-xN 薄膜與
每一接面厚度大小將是最大關鍵之
製程參數，由於本實驗室目前尚無可
靠度比較好之光學模擬軟體，僅能以
現有之 ISE-TCAD 與 Medici 等模擬軟
體先行初步進行設計，而該軟體僅能
以理想之薄膜材料來楚理，因此以實
際之製程技術驗證其結果，反覆進行
比對與修正製程參數，換言之，最佳
化之元件設計仍有相當改進之研究
空間，加上這種材料應用在太陽能電
池使用上，目前文獻報導仍屬於萌芽
階段，僅能由錯誤中學習設計最佳化
之元件結構。 
3. 在「光學量測方面」方面，基本
上可至奇美電子廠與茂迪光電廠之
量測實驗室實作，然借用該光電廠之
設備常常必須配合該廠之時程，往往
造成極大不方便，倘要建立本身之量
測實驗室更是要發費相當多之財

Fig. 1. Cross-section schematic diagram of the proposed
In Ga N–GaN-based solar cells with an MQW structure using a
SiCN–Si(111) substrate. An antireflective coating formed on the ITO layer.
prepared to grow In Ga N–GaN-based solar cells using the
Thomas Swan commercial low-pressure metal–organic
chemical vapor deposition (LP-MOCVD) system. During the
growth, trimethylgallium (TMGa), trimethylindium (TMIn),
and ammonia (NH ) were used as the gallium, indium, and
nitrogen sources, respectively. Bis-cyclopentadienyl magne-
sium Cp Mg and silane (SiH ) were used as the p-type
and n-type doping sources, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1
[8], the proposed In Ga N–GaN-based solar cell structure
consists of SiCN buffer layers 0.1 m , a Si-doped n-GaN
layer 2 m with a concentration of cm ,
Si-doped n-type In Ga N 0.2 m , a 10-period undoped
In Ga N–GaN MQW active region, and a Mg-doped p-type
In Ga N 0.2 m . Each In Ga N–GaN MQW pair
consists of a 3.0-nm In Ga N well layer and a 13-nm GaN
barrier layer. To improve the light absorption and contact resis-
tivity of the p-type GaN 0.5 m contact layer, the p-type
GaN layer was deposited and textured with KOH solution, and
a 300-nm-thick indium–tin–oxide (ITO) film was deposited
onto the p-type GaN surface, respectively. Ni (2.5 nm)/Au
(4.5 nm) contacts were then evaporated onto the ITO film to
form the p-type pad [9], [10]. Then, Ag contacts were deposited
onto the exposed Si substrate to serve as the back-side metal
pad. In Ga N–GaN-based solar cells without an MQW
layer were also fabricated for comparison. In this work, the
current–voltage ( – ) characteristics under air-mass 1.5 global
(AM 1.5G) illumination were measured using an HP 4145 B
semiconductor parameter analyzer and a transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) system to examine the crystal sizes and
structures of the proposed device.
The effect of growth dislocation on the performance
of In Ga N–GaN-based solar cells is shown by the
cross-sectional TEM images in Fig. 2. The bright-field images
of the samples grown with and without the SiCN buffer layer are
shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), respectively. A portion of the MQW
structure of the device with the SiCN buffer layer is shown in
Fig. 2(c). was set to 0.32. The indium mole fraction ( ) was
also confirmed by photoluminescence measurement. As can be
seen in Fig. 2(a) and (b), the GaN layer on Si shows a cloudy
morphology and cracks. Fig. 2(a) shows that no MQW structure
appeared. This is attributed to the heteroepitaxial growth of

the In Ga N–GaN-based MQW, which was affected by the
lattice mismatch between GaN and Si. It can also be seen that
the characteristics of In Ga N–GaN-based solar cells on a Si
substrate may be significantly affected by the presence of lattice
mismatch-related defects. In Ga N–GaN-based materials
on SiCN–Si substrates are of lesser quality than those grown
on Si mainly owing to the large lattice and thermal mismatches
between GaN and Si. The darker and lighter layers in Fig. 2(c)
are In Ga N and GaN, respectively. Each In Ga N–GaN
MQW pair consists of a 3.0-nm-thick In Ga N well layer
and a 13-nm-thick GaN barrier layer.
All the defects in the n-GaN epilayer originate from those in
the SiCN buffer layer, showing typical contrast features. Some
of these start at the SiCN buffer layer and stop at the n-GaN epi-
layer, while others start at the buffer layer and propagate through
the entire n-GaN epitaxial layer (threading defects). It is pre-
sumed that the lattice constant shrinks gradually from 5.43 of
Si to 4.36 of SiCN, which provides a very good buffer layer
matching the n-GaN layer lattices [7].
On the nanometer scale, sharp and abrupt interfaces were
observed between the QWs and the barriers [Fig. 2(c)]. The
QWs showed lateral undulation, and extended defects were ob-
served. Note that the image shown in Fig. 2(b) shows only the
screw dislocation density, while the mixed and edge disloca-
tions are totally invisible under these imaging conditions. De-
fects belonging to the lattice mismatch present a typical dislo-
cation-like contrast. Mixed screw threading dislocations (TDs)
act as centers for the spiral growth of n-GaN by making surface
steps, whereas edge TDs form small-angle boundaries of n-GaN
grains slightly misoriented to each other [11]. The TD densities
are about to cm in the observed area and
it is does not vary substantially with distance from the SiCN in-
terface.
The best cell produced to date for the AM l.5G solar spectrum
has an energy conversion efficiency of 5.43% at AM 1.5G. The
current density-voltage ( – ) characteristics, short-circuit cur-
rent density , open-circuit voltage , and FF are given
in Fig. 3. Note that the sample without the SiCN buffer layer had
poor photovoltaic performance mainly owing to the large lattice

In this work, the design and fabrication of Au/n-Si Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) with various edge
termination schemes, including a reduced-surface-ﬁeld-type lateral super-junction, a polycrystalline silicon
(poly-Si) ﬂoating ring, and a p+-poly-Si guard ring, are presented. Experimental results show that the
reverse leakage current of the proposed SBDs was reduced and the breakdown voltage increased with an
increase of the poly-Si width of the guard ring.
It was found that the device and fabrication technology developed in the present study is applicable to the
realization of SBDs with a high breakdown voltage (≥160 V), a low reverse current density (≤5.6 μA/cm2), a
low forward voltage drop (≤5.6 V @ 1 A/cm2), and an adjustable Schottky barrier height of 0.764 to 0.784 eV.

The Schottky barrier diode (SBD) is formed by a metal is contact
with a semiconductor. It is a majority carrier device with applications
in the high frequency area. However, it is difﬁcult to apply SBDs to high
power devices due to their low breakdown voltage, which is caused by
the edge effect [1–5]. SBDs differ from p–n injection devices in that
rectiﬁcation occurs as a result of the potential barrier between the
metal and semiconductor, rather than a doping proﬁle. SBDs are
majority-carrier devices which offer the advantage of faster reverse
recovery without the minority-carrier stored charge that is observed
in p–n rectiﬁers and p–i–n rectiﬁers. SBDs with low a forward voltage
drop (VF), low reverse leakage current density (JR), and high
breakdown voltage (VBD), are required in the electronics industry
[2,4,5]. VF and JR of SBDs are key factors in determining the power loss
of SBDs for power applications, which strongly depend on the
Schottky barrier height (SBH). In general, a large SBH results in a
low JR but a large VF, and vice versa [6,7]. Furthermore, VBD strongly
depends on the distribution of the surface electric ﬁeld of the devices
under reverse bias. How to suppress JR to achieve SBDs withminimum
power loss and how to improve the breakdown voltage of SBDs so that
it approaches the theoretical value are still problems in device
fabrication.
In this work, SBDs with sophisticated edge termination (ET)
structures, including p+-poly-Si guard ring and ﬂoating ring, ﬁeld
plate, and RESURF (REduced SURface Field)-type [8–11] lateral super-
junction (LSJ), are proposed and fabricated. The various edge
termination schemes employed in this work are aimed at reducing
the surface electric ﬁeld to obtain a breakdown voltage that
approaches the ideal value. The inﬂuence of the geometric parameters
of the ET structure, including the widths of the guard ring, ﬂoating
ring, and ﬁeld plate, as well as the space between the guard ring and
the ﬂoating ring, on the electric properties of devices is investigated.
To avoid possible damage to the semiconductor surface used for the
metal/semiconductor Schottky contact, a fabrication process for the
guard ring that employs boron ion implantation into a poly-Si overlayer
and then thermal diffusion into the substrate is employed. The effects of
the proposed fabrication process on JR reduction as well as VBD
enhancement are also discussed. Technology related to the design and
fabrication processes for silicon SBDs with a high breakdown voltage
(VBD≥160 V) and a low leakage current density (JR≤5.6 μA/cm2) is also
presented.
2. Experimental procedure
To study effects of various ET designs on the breakdown charac-
teristics of SBDs, three different types of SBD as shown in Fig. 1, were
fabricated. Fig.1(a) shows the typeAdevice,whichhas ap+-poly-Si guard
ringandaﬁeldplateETdesign. The typeBdevice (Fig.1(b)) isbasedon the
structure of typeA but it has an additionalﬂoating ring at the periphery of
the device. Fig. 1(c) shows the structure of the type C device, in which a
RESURF-type LSJ ETscheme is incorporatedwith the typeBSBDs structure
[10]. A portion of the top view of the type C device is shown in Fig. 1(d).

RESURF-type LSJ structure are 30 μm and 4 μm, respectively. Several
RESURF-type LSJ structures, which include p+-poly-Si guard ring, ﬂoating
ring, and three dimension (3D) terminations with radial geometry, are
shown in Fig.1(e). In the type B device, the spacing between the p+-poly-
Si guard ring and theﬂoating ringwas about 40 μm. The same spacingwas
also used for the type C device. In the type C device design, the super
junction has a distance of 30 μm and 5 μm to the guard ring and ﬂoating
ring, respectively. In this device design, the super-junction is not
connected to the p+-poly-Si guard ring or ﬂoating ring, as conﬁrmed by
the Integrated System Engineer–Technology Computer-Aided Design
(ISE–TCAD) simulation results [5–7]. All SBDs had the same active region
area of 0.01 cm2 and the same ﬁeld platewidth of 30 μm. Thewidth of the
p+-poly-Si guard-ring, Wg, ranged from 18 to 50 μm. The width of the
ﬂoating ring,Wf, for type B and C devices was 30 μm.
The basic fabrication process of SBDs used in our work is illustrated
in Fig. 2. The epiwafers used in the experiments were n−(20 μm)/n+
silicon epiwafers with (100) orientation. The n− epitaxial layer had a
resistivity of 10Ω cm, while the n+ substrate had a resistivity of 0.01Ω
cm. Thewafer was ﬁrst cleaned with a standard RCA process, and then
a 0.1-μm-thick SiO2 layer was grown at 1100 °C with wet oxidization.
Next, the p−region of the RESURF-type LSJ structure was formed
(Fig. 2(a)) using BF2+ implantation with an energy of 20 keV and a
dosage of 1×1011 cm−2. A 0.6-μm-thick scariﬁed ﬁeld SiO2 layer was
then grown at 1100 °C using wet oxidization. This was followed by an
oxide etching to deﬁne the guard-ring pattern (Fig. 2(b)). An un-
doped poly-Si ﬁlmwith a thickness of approximately 300 nmwas then
deposited using a lower pressure chemical vapor deposition reactor at
625 °C [4,5] (Fig. 2(c)). The poly-Si ﬁlm was then subjected to BF2+
implantation at 120 keV with a dosage of 1×1016 cm−2. After
implantation, the sample was annealed at 950 °C in an N2 ambient for
20–80 min (Fig. 2(d)). The doped poly-Si over the guard ring region
served as a dopant diffusion source for the guard ring. Poly-Si and SiO2
etching, using HNO3+HF+CH3COOHmixed solutions and BOE (buffer
oxide etcher) solution, respectively, were then conducted to open the
silicon surface for Schottky metal deposition (Fig. 2(e)). A Schottky
metal was deposited using an e-beam system under a pressure of
around 2×10−6 Torr with a deposition rate of about 5 Å/s. Finally, a
Schottky contact pattern was deﬁned using a lithography process
(Fig. 2(f)).
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were used to
examine the grain sizes of the poly-Si ﬁlm and structures of ﬁlms to
help to explain the results. A sample was measured using TEM system
under the electron wavelength of around 0.00251 nm with a camera
length of 100 cm. Keithley 237 and 590 were used to measure the

SBDs are listed in Table 1, respectively. Note that the modiﬁed Norde
method [14] was employed for the extraction of η and ϕbn. It was
found that an increase in Wg increases VBD, VF, and SBH. However, the
reverse was observed for JBD. The same situation was observed for
type A, type B, and type C devices. The dependence of VF on the width
of the guard ring, as revealed in our experimental results, indicates
that the guard ring (with a p+-poly/p/n− structure) plays a crucial
role in the J–V characteristics of SBDs. In general, the proposed device
structure could be regarded as a parallel connection of a SBD and two
parasitic p+-poly/p/n− diodes (shortened as p/n diodes). The
increase in Wg thus enhances the effect of the parasitic p/n diode on
the I–V characteristics of SBDs. Compared to type A SBDs, a p/n
junction diode using the same substrate system generally exhibits a
lower reverse leakage current, a higher breakdown voltage, a higher
effective barrier height, and a larger VF. Therefore, it is not surprising
that both VF and SBH increase with increasingWg. Although the exact
mechanism underlying such experimental ﬁndings is still under
investigation, the suppression of the reverse leakage current of SBDs
through the use of larger Wg values might play an important role.
3.3. Breakdown characteristics
To further exploit the temperature effect of the proposed ET
structure to improve the reverse characteristics of SBDs, various drive-
in timeswere used for the SBDs. The results are shown in Fig. 5. It can see
that the incorporation of a ﬂoating ring in the type B and C SBDs
produced a higher breakdown voltage (VBD) than that of the type A
device. This suggests that the ﬂoating ring design could lead to a suitable
depletion extension along the device surface. Compared to the type B
SBD, the VBD in the type C SBDwas increased through the use of RESURF-
type LSJ. The arrangement of interlacedp− andn−regions in the RESURF-
type LSJ structuremodiﬁed thedepletion regionbeneath the ETstructure,
and leading to a considerable reduction in the surface electric ﬁeld
intensity [15,16]. In addition, for the 20min driving-in time, the diffusion
depth of p+-poly-Si guard ring was approximately 0.25 μm [5]. Note that
the deeper the diffused length of the p+-poly-Si guard-ring junction, the
higher the reverse breakdown voltage. The breakdown occurred at the
guard-ring and ﬂoating-ring edges of heavily doped poly-Si ﬁlm. Thus,
another method of improving the breakdown voltage is to increase the
breakdown voltage of the p+/n junction [5,15]. In addition, the reverse
leakage current density of the type B and C SBDs was much smaller than
that of the typeASBD sample. This result canbe explainedby the fact that
the poly-Si ﬂoating ring and RESURF-type LSJ structure trapped the
mobile ions and the shallow-diffused junction smoothed the edge-
electrical ﬁeld. This effect inhibited reverse leakage current and led to a
high breakdown voltage.
Fig. 6 shows the statistical plots of breakdown voltages for the
three types of SBD with 30 diodes for each. The samples were
annealed at 950 °C in an N2 ambient for 20 min. The type A SBD had a
low VBD occupation; for example, the occupation of 160 V was about
42%; it was 45% for the type B SBD and 47% for the type C SBD. It was
found that the incorporation of a ﬂoating ring in the type B and C SBDs
led to higher VBD occupation than that of the type A device. Note that
by jointly applying the RESURF-type LSJ and ﬂoating ring structures to
SBDs, further VBD improvement was achieved. The type C SBD had a
better VBD occupation than that of the type B SBD. This result shows
that the type C SBD was a higher barrier-height device compared to
the other diodes, which is being consistent with the previous results.
Therefore, the RESURF-type LSJ structure prevents premature elec-
trical breakdown around the periphery of the diode contact. By
applying the p+-poly-Si guard ring, ﬂoating ring, and RESURF-type LSJ
structure, a high performance Schottky diode with a high breakdown
voltage and a low leakage current can be achieved.
3.4. J–V characteristics of SBDs with various Wg widths
To study how Wg affects the reverse characteristics of the type C
SBDs, J–V characteristics are shown in Fig. 7. Several observations can
be made: (1) The SBDs have almost the same J–V characteristics when
the current density saturates to a value of as high as 1 A/cm2 around
0.45–0.56 V and exhibits a seven logarithmic-decade difference. This
suggests that the proposed SBDs have a near-ideal forward character-
istic and a high driving current density; (2) the Wg=18 μm sample
exhibited the lowest effective barrier height (ϕbn≈0.764 eV); (3) the
diodes have effective barrier heights of 0.764–0.784 V; (4) an increase
in Wg increases VBD and decreases JBD of SBDs; and (5) SBH increased
with increasing Wg width. The reduction in the reverse leakage
current can be attributed to the presence of the RESURF-type LSJ and
poly-Si structures, which suppressed the surface electric ﬁeld of SBDs.Fig. 6. Statistical plots of reverse breakdown voltages for the three types of SBD.

6562 B.W. Liou / Thin Solid Films 517 (2009) 6558–6564
has distances of 30 μm and 5 μm to the guard ring and ﬂoating ring,
respectively. Thus, in this device design, the super-junction is not
connected to the p+-poly-Si guard ring or ﬂoating ring, as conﬁrmed by
Fig. 8 (b).
The p− region of the RESURF-type LSJ structure employed in the
type C device was formed by the BF2+ implantation into the n−
epilayer with an energy of 20 keV and a dosage of 1×1011 cm−2,
producing a third transverse junction around the periphery of the
active region. The width and length of the p− region were 4 μm and
30 μm, respectively. Therefore, the super junction effect of SBDs
manly arises from full depletion in the p/n RESURF-type LSJ structure
along the current path, as conﬁrmed by the ISE–TCAD simulation
results [5–7]. The RESURF-type LSJ structure is expected to further
modulate the surface electric ﬁeld distribution of the SBD under
higher reverse bias. These two geometric parameters and the dose of
the super-junctionwere examined using ISE–TCAD. It was found that
both the p− and n− regions of the super-junctionwere fully depleted
under a large enough reverse bias. The incorporation of a super-
junction caused a redistribution of the surface electric ﬁeld intensity
and affects the breakdown voltage of the SBDs [18].
4. Conclusions
In this work, the design, fabrication, andmeasurement of SBDs using
three ET schemes, including a p+-poly-Si guard ring, a ﬂoating ring, and
a RESURF-type LSJ structure, were presented. The edge terminationwas
shown to improve the reverse characteristics of SBDs. Experimental
results show the effectiveness of the ET design, in which the reverse
leakage current was reduced and the breakdown voltage was increased
by using the ﬂoating ring or a RESURF-type LSJ structure. Practical
Schottky diodes usually suffer from the edge-leakage current around the
periphery of the metal plate. It was found that the leakage current
decreases and VBD increaseswith increasing p+-poly-Si guard-ring area.
By incorporating a RESURF-type LSJ, a ﬂoating ring, and a p+-poly-Si
guard-ring structure (typeCSBD), the shallow-diffuseddepth smoothed
the edge electric ﬁeld, leading to high breakdown voltage and low
leakage current. The type C SBDs, which used the super-junction edge
termination scheme, were shown to have a near-ideal forward J–V
characteristic and a low leakage current under a moderate reverse bias.
Our experimental results indicate that the use of a super-junction
structure for device edge termination could effectively suppress the
electrode sharp-edge effect. The use of ion implantation through poly-Si
for the guard ring formationwas shown to bevery effective inprotecting
the silicon surface and suppressing reverse leakage current. The use of a
long thermal budget on the p+-poly-Si depth of SBDs was effective in
increasing VBD and decreasing JR. The type C SBDswith a RSURF LSJ type
ET structure, which exhibit a high breakdown voltage (VBD≥160 V) and
a low leakage current (JR≤5.6 μA/cm2), have the best ET structure
among the two proposed ET schemes.

on the electric properties of devices are investigated. 
Technology related to the design and fabrication processes 
for InxGa1-xN/GaN-based solar cells with a low Jd, a high Voc, 
a high JSC, a high η , and a high FF is also discussed. 
2. Experiments 
SiCN buffer layers were grown on an n-type Si(111) 
substrate using a rapid thermal chemical vapor deposition 
(RTCVD) system with a horizontal fused quartz furnace tube. 
After being cleaned, the Si(111) substrates were immediately 
loaded into the reaction tube, and the system was pumped 
down to about 10-7 Torr. A previously reported process was 
then used to deposit the SiCN films [10]. The substrate 
temperature was 1150°C, the flow rate of each gas (C3H8, 
NH3, and SiH4) was 80 sccm, and the reactor pressure was 2 
mTorr. During the deposition process, PH3 at a flow rate of 
12-sccm was used as the n-type doping source. All the 
samples were prepared to grow InxGa1-xN/GaN-based solar 
cells using the Thomas Swan 19×2” commercial 
low-pressure metal-organic chemical vapor deposition 
(LP-MOCVD) system. During the growth, trimethylgallium 
(TMGa), trimethylindium (TMIn), and ammonia (NH3) were 
used as the gallium, indium, and nitrogen sources, 
respectively. Bis-cyclopentadienyl magnesium (Cp2Mg) and 
silane (SiH4) were used as the p-type and n-type doping 
sources, respectively. In the proposed multiband gap 
approach, a periodical MQW heterostructure is introduced 
between the p- and n-doped regions of a conventional single 
band gap cell. The desired effect is to increase the carrier 
generation and the photocurrent output by extending the 
absorption properties below the band gap of the basic 
material MQW structures in the intrinsic region. A large 
number of periods was initially considered to optimize the 
absorption of carrier in the well. As shown in Fig. 1, the 
proposed InxGa1-xN/GaN-based solar cell structure consists 
of SiCN buffer layers (~0.1 μm), a Si-doped n-GaN layer (~2 
μm) with a concentration of 4.1°1018 cm-3, Si-doped n-type 
InxGa1-xN (~ 0.2 m　 ), a 20-period undoped InxGa1-xN /GaN 
MQW active region, and a Mg-doped p-type InxGa1-xN (~ 0.1 
μm). Each InxGa1-xN/GaN MQW pair consists of a 2.3-nm 
InxGa1-xN well layer and a 12.7-nm GaN barrier layer. For 
comparison, a similar device was fabricated without the 
MQW structure, whose intrinsic layer thickness was equal to 
that of the MQW device in Fig. 1. The performance of device 
with various numbers and widths of QWs was also compared. 
To improve the light absorption and contact resistivity of the 
p-type GaN (~1 μm) contact layer, a p-type GaN layer was 
deposited and textured with KOH solution, and a 300 
nm-thick indium tin oxide (ITO) film was deposited onto the 
p-type GaN surface, respectively. Ni (2.5 nm)/Au (4.5 nm) 
contacts were then evaporated onto the ITO film to form the 
p-type pad [11-15]. Then, Ag contacts were deposited onto 
the exposed Si substrate to serve as the back-side metal pad. 
In this work, the photocurrent density-voltage (J-V) 
characteristics under air-mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) 
illumination were measured using an HP 4145B 
semiconductor parameter analyzer and a transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM) system to examine the crystal 
sizes and structures of the proposed device. The indium mole 
fraction (x) was also clarified by photoluminescence (PL) 
measurement. 
3. Results and Discussion 
In this section, the experimental results of the 
InxGa1-xN/GaN-based solar cells are presented and discussed 
with an emphasis on the characteristics for power generation 
applications. TEM images, photocurrent density-voltage (J-V) 
curves, PL spectroscopy results, Jd characteristics, Jsc and Voc 
as a function of the number of QWs and QW widths, and  　
measurements are presented. The effect of indium content of 
the InxGa1-xN/GaN-based solar cells on the photovoltaic 
characteristics is also investigated.

3.1. Cross-sectional TEM Images  
The effect of growth dislocation on the performance of 
InxGa1-xN/GaN-based solar cells is shown by the cross-sectional 
TEM images in Fig. 2. The darker and lighter layers are InxGa1-xN 
and GaN, respectively. The bright-field images of the 20-period 
undoped MQW region with 0.19 indium content are shown in Fig. 
2(a). Figs. 2(b) to (d) show the portions of the device with the SiCN 
buffer layer to emphasize the MWQ structure. The indium content 
(x) of Fig. 2(b) and Fig. 2(c) was set to 0.19 and 0.36, respectively. 
Each InxGa1-xN/GaN MQW pair consists of a 2.3-nm-thick 
InxGa1-xN well layer and a 12.7-nm-thick GaN barrier layer. The 
wide 3.3-nm-thick InxGa1-xN well layer and the 12.7-nm-thick 
MQW structure of the device are shown in Fig. 2(d), in which x 
was set to 0.19. On the nanometer scale, sharp and abrupt interfaces 
were observed between the QWs and the barriers. The QWs showed 
lateral undulation and had extended defects. This extended defect, 
together with a good spectral match to sunlight, makes the material 
suitable for solar cells. It is possible to grow multiple layers with 
different band gaps, as the material is relatively insensitive to 
defects introduced by a lattice mismatch between the layers. 
As can be seen in Figs. 2(a) to 2(d), the GaN layer with a SiCN 
buffer layer on Si has an MQW structure. This is attributed to the 
heteroepitaxial growth of the InxGa1-xN/GaN-based MQW, which 
was affected by the lattice mismatch between GaN and Si. It can 
also be seen that the characteristics of InxGa1-xN/GaN-based solar 
cells on a Si substrate are significantly affected by the presence of 
lattice mismatch-related defects [12-15]. InxGa1-xN/GaN-based

For lattice-matched InxGa1-xN/GaN-based material design, it is 
possible to obtain an extended MQW absorption that leads to an 
increased Jsc compared with that of a conventional cell with a bulk 
band gap. There is also evidence of an advantageous QW 
recombination rate, which leads to a Voc that is higher than that 
attainable with a bulk cell of equivalent absorption edge [12,16]. If 
there is no significant reduction in Voc, the net result is an increase 
in η. 
3.3. PL spectroscopy 
Fig. 4 shows the band-edge PL spectra for 
InxGa1-xN/GaN-based solar cells with various levels of x content. 
Fig. 4(a) is p-i(MQW)-n structure and Fig. 4(b) is p-i-n structure. x 
values of 0.19 and 0.29 show emission lines of around 460 and 526 
nm, respectively. It was found that the sample with a low x value 
has a high peak intensity and short wavelength. For example, the PL 
peak intensity of the In0.19Ga0.81N/GaN-based sample is an order of 
magnitude higher than that of the In0.29Ga0.71N/GaN-based sample. 
Note that the bandwidth of the PL spectra of the p-i(MQW)-n 
sample is narrower than that of the p-i-n sample. That is, for the 
active region, the MQW structure provides a good carrier 
confinement as compared to that of the intrinsic region. A 
representative example of the effects of irradiation on the properties 
of In-rich InxGa1-xN/GaN-based alloys is also shown in Fig. 4.

Fig.4. Photoluminescence spectroscopy characteristics of 
InxGa1-xN/GaN-based solar cells with (a) the p-i(MQW)-n structure 
and (b) p-i-n structure, for various values of indium content.  
It can be seen that the PL intensity of the In0.36Ga0.64N/GaN-based 
sample decreased by about 31% and that the PL peak position was 
shifted to 580 nm. These results can also be easily explained by the 
QW lattice mismatch effect; i.e., the crystallized structure during 
deposition was smaller due to the decreased x content. These results 
are consistent with the TEM image in Fig. 2. Thus, the performance 
of the low energy band gap device (with In0.36Ga0.64N/GaN MQWs 
as the active region) is much poorer than that of the high energy 
band gap device (with In0.19Ga0.81N/GaN MQWs as the active 
region), despite the fact that In0.36Ga0.64N/GaN MQWs are expected 
to have a much better spectral overlap with the excitation source. 
This degradation in solar cell performance corroborates the PL 
results shown in Fig. 4 and is a direct consequence of reduced 
material quality with increasing x, which leads to a higher loss of 
photogenerated charge carriers. The photovoltaic characteristics 
observed here are also consistent with the well established fact that 
the quantum efficiencies of III-nitride green LEDs are much lower 
than those of blue LEDs. 
3.4 Dark current density, Jd 
Jd of InxGa1-xN/GaN-based solar cells was measured. It is 
plotted in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b) versus applied voltage and the number 
of QWs, respectively. In these figures, it can be seen that: (1) the Jd 
of all samples increased with the applied voltage; (2) the Jd of all 
samples increased with the number of QWs; (3) the Jd of the 
p-i(MQW)-n sample is smaller than that of the p-i-n sample; and (4) 
Jd increased with x content. All the above observations are 
consistent with previous results. For the InxGa1-xN/GaN-based 
sample, Jd was affected by the increased number of 
lattice-mismatch defects and the effective decrease in the energy 
bang gap of QW. That is, Jd was occurred by the effect of capture 
and escape rates of photo-excited carriers. Note that the reduction 
of Jd was achieved by adding the QW structure and decreasing 
indium content. Cells with low-level-indium-content QW may 
obtain a high band gap of QW. The high QW band gap in 
InxGa1-xN/GaN-based solar cells reduces the total strain of the 
MQW structure and minimizes the formation of lattice-mismatch 
defects, which can increase non-radiative recombination.  
As the number of wells of the MQW structure is increased, the 
level of the Shockley-Hall-Read (SHR) recombination is also 
increased [17,18]. Jd is expected to increase linearly with the 
number of QWs, partly due to increased recombination and partly 
due to an increased level of recombination in the i-region. The 
ideality factor (n) can be derived from the slope of the Jd-V curves 
of Fig. 5(a). The deviation of n from one indicates that either 
unusual recombination mechanisms are present or that the 
recombination is changing in magnitude. Thus, n is an effective tool 
for examining the recombination in a device. Note that, with the 
introduction of MQW into the p-i-n device, the non-radiative 
recombination dominates at all biases and n equals 2.32 to 2.86 for 
the proposed MQW devices (see Table I). Thus, a high ideality 
factor in the InxGa1-xN/GaN-based sample is probably a 
characteristic of defect-assisted tunneling current at the interface of 
the MQWs because there are many defects at the interface of the 
6 
 
intermediate built-in electric field, high escape rates from very thin 
and shallow wells enhance the collection in the MQW region, 
leading to a high Voc. Thus, the wider the well, the less likely the 
carrier will be able to escape, which increases the likelihood of 
recombination in the well. Devices with high indium content 
showed Jsc improvement but Voc reduction when the well width was 
changed from 2.3 to 12 nm. At this well width, the increased 
absorption from the QW begins to outweigh the increased 
recombination at the InxGa1-xN/GaN interfaces. Thus, the effect of 
QW width on Voc is opposite to that on Jsc. Thinner QWs allow 
more wells to be included, while wider wells have fewer 
InxGa1-xN/GaN interfaces and thus fewer interface recombination 
opportunities. The results presented here of the effect of the thin 
intrinsic region on carrier collection of a large number of periods 
suitable for an optimized absorption in the wells or thick QW to 
reduce the total strain of the structure. The thick QW structure can 
prevent misfit dislocations at well/barrier interfaces that act as 
recombination centers. 
3.6 Photovoltaic conversion efficiency,　 
Fig. 7 shows the dependence of photovoltaic conversion 
efficiency on the number of QWs in the intrinsic region of 
p-i(MQW)-n solar cells. In this figure, the width of QWs remains 
fixed at 2.3 nm and indium content ranges from 0.19 to 0.36. The 
behavior results from the interaction of the variations in the current 
and voltage produced by the incremental cell and referred to the 
behavior of the AM 1.5G spectrum. As is evident, the In0.19Ga0.81N 
MQW devices exhibit higher efficiencies than those of cells with 
higher mole fractions of indium. In particular, the In0.19Ga0.81N 
MQW device with a 20-period QW shows an efficiency of 5.95%, 
which is an improvement over the In0.36Ga0.64N device (4.97% 
efficiency). The InxGa1-xN/GaN-based solar cells show efficiency 
improvement when the number of QW increases. That is the QW 
number for which the increased absorption from the QW begins to 
outweigh the increased recombination at the InxGa1-xN/GaN 
interfaces. The large number of QWs is essential for allowing 
enough QW absorption to offset the enhanced recombination from 
interfaces. However, when the intrinsic region thickness is not thin 
enough to maintain a sufficient electric field across the junctions, 
carriers photo-generated or captured in the QW region recombine if 
the thermionic energy required to escape from the well is too large. 
It was also found that under AM1.5, the MQW cells exhibited 
inferior performance to that of conventional p-i-n cells without the 
QW structure [12-15]. Furthermore, by increasing the number of 
QWs, the absorption and photocurrent increase, but the 
recombination of the interface also increases, leading to a decrease 
in the output voltage. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the solar 
cell design. Thus, the present study lays the framework for a future 
work that could provide insight into how InxGa1-xN/GaN-based 
MQW devices can be improved to operate at or near ideal limits.

4. Conclusion 
Incorporating InxGa1-xN/GaN-based QWs in the intrinsic region 
of a p-i-n InxGa1-xN solar cell can increase the 　 value found in 
single band-gap cells, depending on the mole fraction of indium and 
device design parameters. InxGa1-xN/GaN-based MQW 
photovoltaic cells with high efficiencies were grown by applying 
the SiCN/Si(111) substrate design. InxGa1-xN/GaN-based solar cells 
grown on SiCN/Si are of lesser quality than those grown on Si 
mainly due to the large lattice and thermal mismatches between 
GaN and Si. Voc depends on the indium content of InxGa1-xN alloy. 
The additional Voc reduction can be attributed to more defects in the 
high indium composition film. The number of QWs has an equal 
effect on Jd, Jsc, and 　. Wider QW increases Jsc but decreases Voc. 
That is, wider QW can decrease the absorption edge, which 
decreases the effective built-in electric field of QW. More energy 
levels are available and absorption per well increases as a result. A 
larger number of wells within the depletion region decreases the 
absorption edge and increases Jsc. This suggests that an increase in 
the efficiency is determined by the optimization of a solar cell 
design. Photovoltaic cells were grown with high efficiencies of 4.97 
to 5.959%, depending on indium content. Results show that the 
improvement in efficiency strongly depends on the number and the 
width of QWs.  can be 　 increased by the confinement effects of 
the MQW absorber and by reducing the number of dislocations of 
the sample using InxGa1-xN/GaN-based design. These results can be 
used as a guide for designing and interpreting the performance 
characteristics of InxGa1-xN/GaN-based MQW photovoltaic cells. 
The improvements described here represent significant progress 
toward the application of this technology to terrestrial power 
generation using concentrator solar cell modules.

In this work, a three-dimensional (3-D) simulation and design for triple-gate fin field effect transistors (FinFETs) 
with channel length in the range of 38~17 nm are presented. Effects of structural parameters such as gate length, 
channel height (Hfin), and channel thickness (Tfin), etc., on the electrical characteristics of FinFETs were analyzed 
in detail. Special emphasis has been focused on the short channel effects (SCEs) of the deep sub-tenth micron 
FinFETs, in which the threshold voltage saturation (VTsat), drain induced barrier lowing (DIBL), subthreshold 
swing (SS), and on-to-off current ratio were investigated. Optimization of device design to suppress SCEs was 
proposed and discussed. Calculated results reveal that FinFETs with channel height and thickness of 2 and 1.4 nm, 
respectively, would have low DIBL(<50 mV/V), low SS (<90 mV/decade), and high on-to-off current ratio(> 105). 
KEYWORDS: 3-D simulation, FinFETs, short channel effects, drain induced barrier lowering, subthreshold swing, on-to-off current ratio. 
 
1. Introduction 
I As the feature size of vary large scaled integration (VLSI) 
is scaled down, the influence of gate electrode on channel 
conductivity falls off significantly. In addition, the 
punch-through effect becomes much serious, which strongly 
degrades the device performance. In recent years, some 
advanced structures, including FinFETs, silicon-on-insulator 
(SOI) devices with ultra-thin body (UTB), and Schottky 
barrier (SB) MOS transistors, etc., have been proposed [1-4] 
to release or even overcome such problems. The use of 
FinFET, which is with a free-stand three-direction channel, 
has been shown being able to enhance the function of gate on 
channel conductivity control and release the punch-through 
effect. Essentially, FinFETs is a special kind of multi-gate 
(MG) MOS device that has been shown to be very effective 
in the suppression of short-channel effects [4,5]. It is very 
advantageous for scaled devices especially of DRAM cells 
and CMOS devices [6]. Since FinFET has excellent 
performance in suppressing roll-off characteristics commonly 
encountered in conventional MOSFETs, it is possible to 
release the SCEs with a lightly doped or un-doped channel. 
Essentially, the structural parameters of FinFETs, such as the 
height and width of the silicon fin, play a crucial role in 
determining its electrical characteristics. Especially, as the 
channel length is scaled down in the deep sub-tenth micron 
regime (e.g., < 90 nm), it has been shown that the different 
degrees of channel induction by the top and vertical gate 
might cause very different device performance [7]. Under the 
circumstance, FinFETs should by no means be free from 
SCEs. Since the SCEs of the FinFET are 3-D phenomena that 
are sensitive to the geometry of the device, 3-D process and 
device simulations are indispensable to the optimum design 
of FinFETs.  
The deep sub-tenth micron FinFETs devices with 
immunity from SCEs have been urgently required in 
electronic ULSI industry [8,9]. Essentially, DIBL, SS, low 
leakage current and driving capability are key factors in 
determining the quality of FinFETs for deep sub-tenth micron 
device applications, which strongly depend on the device 
geometry size. To release the trade-off problem between 
SCEs and device performances is still an open problem in the 
design and fabrication of FinFETs. In this work, 3-D 
simulation and design of triple-gate FinFETs is presented. 
ISETCAD simulator including Devise, NOFFSET, and fully 
3D device simulator Dessis [8] were used, which calculates 
the currents and electric fields in the devices using a 
Poisson–Schrödinger solving algorithm. Dependence of 
electrical characteristics and device geometrical parameters 
such as gate length (Lgate), channel thickness (Tfin), and 
channel height (Hfin), etc., were analyzed and discussed. 
Device simulations predict good performance down to 17 nm 
gate length. Special emphasis is focused on the optimization 
of device design and the impact of SCEs in FinFETs. 
Guidelines for device design will also be proposed. 
2.Device geometry 
Device geometries and dimensional definitions of a typical 
FinFET are schematically shown in Fig. 1. It is noted that 
there is a triple-gate electrode wraps around the channel, 
which enables a much better control on the channel 
conductivity than that of conventional MOSFETs.  
As shown in the figure, the physical gate length Lgate and 
effective gate length Leff are defined as the gap length 
between the two spacers and the length covered by the gate 
electrode, respectively. The height and thickness of the fin 
channel are denoted by Hfin and Tfin, respectively. Basically, 
Tfin is the width of the channel in triple-gate MOSFETs. 
 The width of the FinFET, Tfin, only counts one side of the 
channel, which is the typical definition for trible-gate devices. 
Note that Tfin is equals to the fin width because the current 
flows along the horizontal surfaces of the fin.

Based on the calculated data shown in Fig. 3, the current 
density distribution will be analyzed more exactly. Along the 
z-direction and at three different positions inner the cut-plane, the 
maximum current density identically occurs at around 1.4 nm 
beneath the corner shown as Fig. 3(a). Similarly, along the 
y-direction and at three different positions inner the cut-plane, the 
maximum current density also identically occurs at around 1nm 
inner the corner shown as Fig. 3(b). According to this result, 
FinFET with Tfin of around 2 nm and Hfin of around 1.4 nm would 
promise a better electrical characteristic.

Fig. 3 The on-state current density of the cutting lines: (a) near the 
middle region of vertical gate surface, (b) near the middle region of 
the channel bottom. 
The calculated results shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, indicate that 
the VTsat variations is a function of Tfin and Hfin. It can be seen that: 
(1) the VTsat decreases with the increase of Tfin and Hfin ; (2) the VTsat 
variations of Tfin is more significant than that of Hfin; and (3) the 
VTsat variations for the large sizes of Tfin and Hfin are greater than 
that of the small sizes. These facts mean that for the greater size of 
FinFET, the gate dominating capability over channel is more 
slightly. In the contrast, for the smaller size device, almost all the 
channel volume can be induced by the gate electrode bias. The 
effect, which the punch-through current increases with the increase 
of the size, can be explained by the gate electrode incompletely 
controlling over the channel volume. Thus, in order to achieve the 
desired threshold voltages will be a significant challenge in 
triple-gate devices. Threshold voltage control requires gate 
workfunction tuning, channel doping, or asymmetrical designs 
[10-13].

4. Conclusions 
Using 3-D numerical simulation and analytical modeling, the 
scaling effects from SCE in FinFET device design are presented. 
The studies in this paper also provide a tractable theoretical base for 
design space in FinFET. 3D simulation and device design of 
FinFET with channel length in the range of 37~18 nm has been 
presented. To determine the optimum SOI thickness of triple-gate 
FinFET, electronic characteristics are also investigated. Important 
results obtained form 3D simulation of FinFET are summarized as 
follows:  
(1) VTsat decreases with increasing Lgate and decreases with the 
increase of Tfin and Hfin.  
(2) The DIBL increases considerably with Lgate especially for 
large-sized devices. For DIBL<100, it requires Tfin ≤ 7 nm @ 
Lgate = 18 nm, or Tfin ≤ 8 nm @ Lgate = 25 nm, or Tfin ≤ 10 nm 
@ Lgate = 37 nm. 
(3) The optimal structure for SS<100: Tfin ≤ 9nm @ Lgate = 18 nm, 
or Tfin ≤ 12 nm @ Lgate = 25 nm, or Tfin ≤ 15 nm @ Lgate = 37 
nm. 
The on-to-off current ratio could be enhanced by decreasing either 
Tfin or Hfin. Effect of Tfin on the on-to-off current ratio is seen much 
stronger than that of Hfin.
