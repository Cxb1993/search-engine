1.  Introduction 
  
ZnO has some outstanding properties such as a direct bandgap of 3.37eV, a large 
exciton binding energy(60meV), transparent conductivity, non-centrosymmetric 
symmetry, bio-safe and bio-compatiable[1]. Therefore, ZnO can be applied to 
optoelectronic, piezo-electric, sensor, biomedical, and electro-chemical fields. There 
are many methods for preparing nanosized ZnO, including physical vapor 
deposition[2], chemical vapor deposition[3], spary pyrolysis[4], sol-gel[5], and 
electrochemical deposition[6]. 
 TiO2 has an energy gap about 3.1eV, and because various defects, such as 
non-stoichiometric composition and impurities, can easily occur in itself, so it is 
generally a semiconductor. TiO2 can be applied to many fields, including 
photocatalysis[7], sensing[8], photoelectrolysis[9], and photovotaics[10]. Nanosized 
TiO2 can be preapred by using various methods, such as anodic oxidation[11], anodic 
alumina templet[12], sol-gel[13], seed crystal growth[14], and hydrothermal 
process[15]. 
 Fe3O4 has a cubic inverse spinel structure and exhibits magnetism with a Curie 
temperature of 858K. Fe3O4 is generally used as a ferrimagnetic material, a black 
pigment, and a catalyst in the Haber process and in the water gas shift reaction[16]. 
Fe3O4 nano-particles are used as contrast agents in MRT scanning[17]. Most of the 
nanosized Fe3O4 are nanoparticles[18,19], some are nano films[20], and few are 
nanowires[21]. 
 MgO has a melting point of 3125K and a band gap of 7.8eV. It is physicall and 
chemically stable at high temperature, so it is an important refractory material and is 
used as an insulator in industrial cables, as a basic refractory material for crucibles, 
and as a principal fireproof ingredient in construction materials. Pressed MgO is also 
used as an optical material. It is transparent from 0.3 to 7μm. Methods for preparing 
MgO nanowires include thermal vapor deposition[22], pulsed laser deposition[23], 
direct reaction[24], and chemical vapor deposition with catalyst[25]. 
 In this work, a novel method was used to grow the nanowires of ZnO, TiO2, 
Fe3O4, and MgO. These metal oxide nanowires were grown on metal substrates 
deposited with a Ni film as catalyst at different temperatures under different 
atmospheres of N2+H2O+O2+CH4. 
 
3. Results an discussions 
Fig. 1(a) showed the SEM view of surface morphology of ZnO nanowires which 
were grown on the α  brass deposited with a Ni film as catalyst at 700℃ for 30 min. 
under an atmosphere of N2(120 sccm)+O2(60 sccm)+CH4(60 sccm)+H2O(g)(from 
50℃ water). The ZnO nanowires were quite uniformly grown over the substrate 
surface. Fig, 1(b) is an enlargement of (a), which showed the ZnO nanowires have a 
length over 10μm and a diameter about tens of nanometers. The EDS pattern and 
composition for these ZnO nanowires were shown in Fig. 1(c). It can be seen from 
composition analysis that the O is much deficient in ZnO, so the formula for these 
nanowires is ZnO1-X. 
 The SEM view of surface morphology of TiO2 nanowires was shown in Fig. 1(a). 
These nanowires were grown on the Ti plate deposited with a Ni film as catalyst at 
900℃ for 30min. under an atmosphere of N2(150 sccm)+O2(30 sccm)+CH4(90 
sccm)+ H2O(g) ( from 40℃ water). The TiO2 nanowires were quite uniformly grown 
over the substrate surface. An enlargement view of (a) was shown in Fig. 2(b) which 
revealed that these nanowires have a length over 10μm and a diameter about tens of 
nanometers. Fig. 2(b) also revealed that there are films on the substrate surface in 
addition to wires. The EDS pattern and composition for these TiO2 nanowires were 
shown in Fig. 2(c), which revealed that the O is deficient in TiO2, so the formula for 
these nanowires is TiO2-X. 
 Fig. 3(a) and (b) showed the SEM view of surface morphology of Fe3O4 
nanowires, (b) being an enlargement view of (a). The Fe3O4 nanowires were grown at 
650℃ for 30min. under an atmosphere of N2(150 sccm)+O2(100 sccm)+CH4(25 
sccm)+ H2O(g) ( from 30℃ water). It can be seen that the Fe3O4 nanowires are not 
straight and have a relatively thin tip. The length of these nanowires is about several 
μms. The composition analysis shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d) revealed that the Fe atom is 
deficient in Fe3O4, so the formula for these nanowires is Fe3-XO4. The SEM views of 
surface morphology of Fe3O4 nanowires were shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b), (b) being an 
enlargement of (a). These Fe3O4 nanowires were grown at 850℃ for 30min. under an 
atmosphere of N2(100cm)+O2(50ccm)+CH4(0 sccm)+ H2O(g) ( from 80℃ water). The 
nanowires were quite uniformly and densely grown over the substrate surface. The 
length of nanowires is aobut several μm. The EDS pattern and composition shown in 
Fig. 4(c) revealed that these Fe3O4 nanowires are also deficient in Fe, so they have a 
formula of Fe3-XO4. 
 Fig. 5 showed the XRD patterns for Fe3O4 nanowires of Fig. 3(a) and 4(b). The 
two XRD patterns revealed that these nanowires all have a structure of magntitite, i.e. 
Fe3O4. 
 The SEM views and EDS patterns for MgO were shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. The 
700, 650, and 350℃. 
 From the standard oxidaton potential ( )(VE°  at 25℃) for −+ +→ eMM 22 , 
Ti(1.63), Zn(0.763), Fe(0.440), Ni(0.250), and Cu(-0.337), it can be seen that the 
tendance for the metal beng oxygenized is Mg>Ti>Zn>Fe>Ni>Cu. 
 Therefore, when gas mixture of N2+O2+CH4+H2O(g) flows into tube at 900, 850, 
and 650℃, CH4 gas almost decomposes into C(s) and H2(g), H2O gas almost can not 
decompose into H2 and O2, and C(s) and H2(g) from CH4 almost are oxygenized into 
H2O. The O2 pressure in the tube should be very small, which is about 10-6atm 
calculated according to nKRTG l−=°Δ , where K is equillibrium constant of 
reactions. Under this condition, the nanowires of ZnO, TiO2, Fe2O3 can be grown on 
α  brass, Ti plate, and Fe plate under the catalysis of Ni film. For MgO nanowires, 
which were grown at 350℃ under an atmosphere of N2(150 sccm)+H2O(g) ( from 
60℃ water), and CH4(50 sccm), H2O(g) and CH4 both almost cann’t decompose into 
H2+O2, and C(s)+H2, respectively at 350℃, therefore, the MgO nanowires were also 
grown under the condition of very low O2 pressure.

 1. Introduction 
Due to its excellent property on photocatalysis, the nanosized titania has a 
widespread application, such as photo catalysis[1], sensing[2], photoelectrolysis[3], 
photovoltaic[4], and so on. There are many forms of nanosized titania, containing 
nanoparticles[5], nanowhisker[6], nanorod[7], nanosheet[8], nanofiber[9], 
nanowire[10], and nanotube[11]. Nanosized titania can be prepared by using various 
methods, such as anodic oxidation[12], anodic alumina templet[13], sol-gel[14], seed 
crystal growth[15], hydrothermal pocess[16], and others. 
 The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) was also be used to prepare the nanosized 
titania. TiO2 particles were produced in a tabular flow reactor by a chemical vapor 
deposition technique using titanium tetraisopropoxide( Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4 ) as a starting 
material at low temperature and atmospheric pressure[17]. Light induced chemical 
vapor deposition (LICVD) was used to deposite TiO2 from Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4 in an 
oxygen atmosphere[18]. In the so-called metalorganic chemical vapor deposition 
(MOCVD) for the preparation of nanosized titania, most of staring materials are 
Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4[19,20], some are TiCl4[21]. 
 In this work, the chemical vapor deposition technique was also be used to 
prepare the titania, but it was different from that published. The titania was grown on 
a substrate of Ti plate which has been deposited a film of Ni as a metal catalyst for the 
growth of titania at an elevated temperature under a furnace atmosphere of 
N2+H2O+O2+CH4. The effects of furnace atmosphere on the growth of titania were 
investigated in detail. 
 3. Results and discussions 
a. Atmosphere of H2O+N2  
The result of titania growth at 900℃ for 30 min under the atmosphere of 
150sccm N2 flowing through 40℃ water was shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen from 
Fig. 1(a) and (b) that the titania comprises wires and films. The wires have a 
diameter of nanosize and a length about 10 . The films have an irregular shape. 
Fig. 1(a) and (b) showed the specimen contains only Ti and O, and the Ni 
deposited on Ti surface disappeared, which means that the Ni has diffused into 
substrate or the Ti has diffused out and covered the Ni deposit. 
The results of titania growth for 150 sccm N2 flowing through 60℃ and 80℃ 
water are similar to that through 40℃ water, i.e. the titania comprises wires and 
films, and the Ni deposited on Ti surface disappeared. 
Fig. 2 showed the XRD patterns for the specimen grown under the atmosphere 
of 150 sccm N2 flowing through 40℃(A), 60℃(B) and 80℃(C) water. It revealed 
that titania is TiO2. 
 
b. Atmosphere of O2+N2 
  Fig. 3 showed the result of titania growth at 900℃ for 30 min. under the 
atmosphere of 150 sccm N2 +30 sccm O2. Fig. 3(a) and (b) showed the SEM 
views of surface morphologies, (b) is the enlargement view of (a). There are no 
wires and only particles with micro-size. The composition analysis in Fig. 3(c) 
and (d) showed that there are O, Ti ,and Ni in specimen surface, Fig. 4 is the XRD 
pattern for the specimen grown at 900℃ for 30 min. under the atmosphere of 150 
sccm N2 +30 sccm O2, which showed that the specimen comprises phases of Ni, 
NiO, and Ni3TiO5. 
micro-sized particles appeared on the specimen surface, and they all have a 
composition of O, Ti, and Ni. 
 
e. Atmosphere of O2+CH4+N2 
  For the titania growth at 900℃ for 30 min under the atmosphere of 150 sccm 
N2 +30 sccm CH4, Fig. 8(a) and (b) were the SEM views of surface morphologies 
which showed the titania has a particular shape like caterpillars and has a 
composition of O and Ti, as shown in Fig. 8(c)  and (d). The formation of the 
titania with such a shape may be due to a preferred orientation for the crystal 
growth. 
When the flow rate of CH4 was increased to 60 sccm, there had carbon nanowires 
appeared on the titania films of which shapes were not like caterpillar, as shown in 
Fig. 9. Under atmosphere of 30 sccm CH4 +60 and 90 sccm O2, the films with a 
composition of Ti, O, and Ni could be grown, and under other atmosphere of 
O2+CH4+N2, only films with a composition of Ti and O could be grown. 
 
f. Thermodynamics for the furnace atmosphere 
  The results of titania growth stated above were collected and listed in Table 3. 
Under the atmosphere of N2+H2O, the reaction and the standard Gibbs free energy 
change °ΔG [22] could be written as follows: 
H2O(g) = H2+O2(g)    )(108.1 5 JG ×=Δ ° at 900℃ ---------(1) 
Ti(s)+O2(g) = TiO2(s)   )(101.7 5 JG ×−=Δ at 900℃ ---------(2) 
2Ni(s)+O2(g) = 2NiO(s)   )(106.2 5 JG ×−=Δ ° at 900℃ ---------(3)

ll −=−=Δ °  for formula of (1), the pressure of 
O2 could be obtained and equals to 0.045 Pa, 0.086 Pa, and 0.154 Pa for 40, 60, 
could be grown. For less CH4 and more O2, i.e. CH4 (30 sccm)+ O2 (60 and 90  
sccm), the particles with a composition of Ti, O, and Ni could be grown.
