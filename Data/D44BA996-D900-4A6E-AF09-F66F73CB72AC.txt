Keywords: flow-body hydrodynamic coupling, boundary effects on hydrodynamic forces, in-situ 
hydrodynamic force measurement, boundary effects on vortex ring structure, flow visualization 
 
This research project lasts three years and four months focusing on how the motions of two 
fully immersed solid objects are coupled prior to direct contact through ambient liquid. We 
developed a pendulum facility and found that the presence of a second near-by solid 
boundary—in both normal and tangential configurations—causes additional deceleration to the 
immersed pendulum swinging motion. To characterize the liquid coupling effect, an influence 
distance δ is defined to denote the interstitial gap at which the pendulum velocity drops a 
specific amount from its free motion. Through systematic experiments, we investigate how δ 
varies with particle Reynolds number, Re, and particle Stokes number, St, and it is found that δ 
increases monotonically with decreasing Re and St for both normal and tangential relative 
surface motions.  
To explain the observed pendulum dynamics and the measured δ-Re and δ-St correlations, 
we conduct two independent but complementary theoretical analyses to model the hydrodynamic 
force under coupled surface motions. One theoretical work extends the classical inviscid Lagally 
theory in two dimension by including free vortices. The resulting theory describes total inviscid 
hydrodynamic force on a solid surface through an algebraic equation using only the strength and 
the location of the singularities employed to generate the flow field, providing a useful research 
tool for general flow-body interaction problems. The second theoretical analysis integrates the 
wall-modified potential flow theory with classical boundary layer theory to formulate a 
framework on which we can study how the second solid boundary affects the unsteady viscous 
force—the Basset history force. The developed model has been applied to formulate a 
boundary-modification term for this force component known to play a crucial role in an accurate 
description of unsteady immersed sphere motion.   
 In addition, to evaluate or validate the proposed theoretical models, we have been 
attempting in-situ and synchronized total and pressure force measurements by integrating load 
cells and pressure transducers. To further achieve spontaneous shear stress quantification, we 
have been developing a sensing module using conventional strain gauges. It took us longer than 
expected to set up all these facilities and careful calibration is an on-going task. However, 
systematic experiments with fruitful results can be expected in the near future. Apart from force 
measurements, we also conducted flow visualization experiments and numerical simulations via 
close collaboration with other research groups. This thread of research provides us a means to 
examine how differently the flow vertical structure evolves when subjected to the influences of a 
second near-by solid boundary, which information should integrate with the hydrodynamic force 
model prediction and measurement to broaden our knowledge on flow-body interaction 
problems.

I. Motivation and Background 
 
The dynamics of dense dry granular flows have been extensively investigated due to its 
prevalence in industrial processes (gasoline drilling, slurry transportation, surface polishing with 
fine particles) and natural hazard problems (avalanches, debris flows, and sedimentation). Unlike 
single-phase materials, a granulate assembly can simultaneously exhibit fluid-like and solid-like 
behaviors when subjected to external loading, possessing a transition zone within the bulk. In 
comparison to the understanding of dry bulk dynamics, our knowledge of how the collective 
motion of dry granulates may change with the presence of interstitial liquid is rather fragmental 
and limited. The incompressible viscous liquid between two colliding surfaces has been shown to 
have significant modifying influence on the contact mechanisms [1-5]. The solid-liquid 
interaction may generate new mechanisms for bulk momentum transport and energy dissipation, 
especially when the two phases move together with comparable inertia, generating distinctive 
bulk behaviors from that exhibited by a dry bulk. In addition, the heterogeneous dual phases may 
also interact with the flow boundary in a manner that evolves with the bulk motion, deviating 
from the deterministic condition for a single-phase continuum [6-8]. 
With advances in computational capability, numerical simulation has become a popular 
research tool to study the mechanics of granular flows. Since the flow is intrinsically discrete at 
the particle size scale, Discrete-Element (DE) simulations is a natural choice in which scheme 
individual particle motion is calculated according to the conservation of linear and angular 
momentum [9,10]. To describe the force acting on each sphere, various contact models have been 
proposed in the literature for interactions between dry surfaces [11-15]. To account for liquid 
forces generated when two wet particles exhibit relative surface motions, lubrication theory or 
some artificial functions have been integrated in to the DE simulation [16-18]. However, when 
excessive water is present, hydrodynamic forces—such as buoyancy force, viscous force, and 
added mass force—may arise to further affect the particle-particle interactions via both direct 
contacts and indirect hydrodynamic coupling.  
For direct particle interactions, various researchers have investigated how interstitial liquid 
affects the collision between a solid sphere and wall or two spheres of identical sizes [1-5, 19-24]. 
A wet coefficient of restitution ewet has been defined using the ratio of surface relative velocity 
after- and before-collision to measure the portion of solid-phase kinetic energy during one contact 
via surface plastic deformation and liquid viscous dissipation. This coefficient is found to 
decrease monotonically with particle Stokes number, St, which compares the particle inertia to 
the quasi-steady viscous drag estimated by Stokes‘ formula. This finding has been implemented 
recently into a discrete-element-type simulation (DEM, on-going research in our team) however 
an equally important piece of information regarding liquid effects when particles are in free 
flight—indirect hydrodynamic coupling—is yet unclear.  
Though several theoretical or semi-empirical force formulae have been proposed in the 
literature to describe the unsteady motion of a fully-immersed particle (mostly sphere), these

III. Literature Survey 
 
In this section, the literature works relevant to this research project are briefly reviewed in 
four aspects: direct immersed collision, non-contact hydrodynamic coupling, hydrodynamic force 
models, and flow visualization for similar flows.  
(III-1) Immersed collisions 
The dynamic problem of collisions between two solid surfaces in a viscous liquid has drawn 
growing interest of researchers of multiphase flows. Extensive amount of experimental works 
have been conducted to investigate particle-on-wall and particle-on-particle collisions using 
either fully immersed sphere or depositing a thin liquid film on the target surface. The surface 
relative motion is created either by dropping one particle vertically along gravity or by releasing a 
particle as a pendulum to generate motion nearly perpendicular to gravity at the lowest swing 
position [1-5, 19-24]. A wet coefficient of restitution (some authors use ‗effective coefficient of 
restitution‘) is conventionally measured as the ratio of post- to pre-collision particle velocity, Up‘ 
and Up, as ewet=-Up‘/Up. This number measures how much particle kinetic energy is lost during

pendulum () [3]; (b) position-time plots for the impact and the target pendulum [4]. 
 
Non-contact hydrodynamic coupling at a distance is also observed when surface relative 
motion is in the tangential direction which phenomenon is especially concerned in the 
development of falling-sphere viscometer. A few models have been proposed to incorporate the 
wall influence on classical Stokes drag using theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, or 
experimental measurements. 
Faxen (1923 [42]) used the method of reflection to obtain an approximate solution to the 
Stokes equation when a solid sphere of radius a translates at constant U parallel to a plane in a 
semi-infinite quiescent viscous fluid at a center-to-plane distance h (see Fig.3). The quasi-steady 
hydrodynamic force, FQD, is calculated and scaled by the Stokes drag to develop a wall factor λ= 
FQD/6πμaU and an approximation at large h/a is given as

For arbitrary s, Halow and Wills (1970 [47]) simply added the wall factor proposed by Cox and 
Brenner for the two walls to estimate the force but this approach at bests approach gives only a 
first-order approximation and is incapable of predicting higher-order effects. Later on, Ho and 
Leal (1974 [48]) applied a perturbation method to study the lateral migration of a neutrally 
buoyant rigid sphere between two plane due to weak inertia effects when suspended in a fluid in 
simple shear flow or two-dimensional Poiseuille flow. Their zero-order solution corresponds to 
the solution to classical Stokes‘ equation and is constructed by the so-called weak interaction 
method reflection using two reflective fields. However, this approximate solution is evaluated 
valid only when b>5a by Ganatos, Pfeffer, and Weinbaum (1980 [49]) who derived a 
semi-analytic solution using their three-dimensional boundary collocation theory [55]. The wall 
factor—their notation of –Fx
t —evaluated in this latest work is shown by the solid lines in Fig. 
6(a).

Instead of using a tube, Brooke (2005 [53]) conducted experiments with its sphere settling 
in the middle of two parallel walls at two terminal Re=54 and 72. The author measured the 
quasi-steady drag by simple force balance, FQD=(mp-mf)g, to estimate a wall correction factor by 
λ(h*)=0.5ρU2Aφ(Re)/FQD . In this expression, h*=h//2a is the interstitial gap, A=πa
2
 is the sphere 
projection area, and φ(Re)=1+0.15Re0.687 is Schiller-Neumann‘s modification on quasi-steady 
drag accounting for liquid inertia [28]. Such scaling is defined under the assumption that 
the liquid inertia effect at higher Re and the wall correction effect at small h* can be 
accounted for by the multiplication of φ(Re) and λ(h*). Such treatment is yet to be verified 
but seems sensible and has been adopted by Joseph (2003 [22]). Brooke‘s results are 
presented in Table 1(a) and its decrease from unity with diminishing h* clearly indicates, 
again, the wall-augmenting effect on quasi-steady drag which effect is observed more pronounced 
for liquid of greater viscosity.  
Lastly, Brook followed Miyamura et. al to estimate the terminal velocity ratio, 
f=U∞/UW, and the results are provided here in Table 1.1(b). The amplified drag results in 
deduction in wall-present terminal velocity giving f much greater than unity.

(III-3) Hydrodynamic force model for unsteady immersed sphere motion 
Ever since Sir G.G. Stokes derived the celebrated Stokes‘ drag law in 1851 [25], the total 
hydrodynamic force on a single solid sphere in a quiescent unbounded fluid at small Reynolds 
number has been studied extensively in the past two centuries [26-38]. The earliest equation of 
motion was derived independently by Stokes (1851 [49]), Boussinesq (1885), and Basset (1888) 
under the condition of small Re as [31]

(III-4) Flow visualization 
To understand flow-body interaction dynamics, flow visualization technique has been 
employed to reveal the flow structure commonly using laser and matching fluorescent dye. When 
the relative velocity between the flow and the body is steady, vortex ring is observed to either 
stay attached or shed constantly depending on flow Re. A good collection of existing knowledge 
can be found in Van Dyke [60].  
Some recent works extend to illuminate vortex ring evolution when the leading particle 
approaches or collide on an adjacent solid surface. Joseph examined the fluid structure within the 
interstitial liquid film during the collision-rebound process between a solid sphere and a wall (see 
Fig.8 [22]).  
 
Fig. 8 Flow visualization of a particle-wall immersed collision. A 12.7mm diameter Delrin 
collides on the Zerodur wall at St=210 and Re=770 . The wall is indicated with the dashed line on 
the right of each frame. A complicated vortical flow structure around the sphere is observed after 
collision at t = 0 (Joseph, 2003 [22]). 
 
Thompson et al. (2007 [61]) drove a solid sphere at constant velocity towards a wall until 
the two surface come into contact. A steady vortex ring was observed behind the approaching 
sphere but when the sphere was brought to a halt, the ring kept moving due to liquid inertia and 
thus deformed around the sphere (see Fig.9). Later on, Yang attempted visualization for the 
vortex ring evolution when an immersed spherical pendulum impacts on an identical target 
sphere. The ring was found to expand radially with small downstream translation (see Fig.10). 
However, there is yet no clear understanding of how such flow structure evolution is correlated to 
particle-wall or particle-particle direct or non-contact interactions.

IV. Results and Discussions 
 
In the following, the research results and findings from this project and some relevant 
collaboration are presented in three categories (hydrodynamic coupling, hydrodynamic force, and 
flow visualization) with integrated efforts of experimental investigations, theoretical analysis, and 
simulation efforts. For the topics that we encountered difficulties, only preliminary results are 
presented and comments on future work are provided.   
Apart from these, 8 SCI journal publications have been achieved, mostly on theoretical 
modeling, and three of them with major breakthrough are provided in the appendix for review. In 
addition, 3 short papers have been submitted to domestic or international conference proceedings 
and 4 oral presentations have been given at international conferences. These are summarized at 
the end of this section.

We have developed a water tank and a pendulum release mechanism in which a solid sphere 
of diameter D and density ρP can be released as a pendulum from a release angle θ in a viscous 
fluid of viscosity μ and density ρ (see Fig. 11 (a)-(b)). A range of Re and StB were achieved by 
using different pendulum sizes, release angles, particle and liquid densities. This impact sphere 
was allowed to move perpendicularly towards a downstream sphere of various diameters, DT, or a 
target wall (Fig.11(c)), giving DT/D=0 (no target), 0.5, 1,2,4,5,12.5, and  (flat wall). Special 
care was made to ensure that the line of sphere centers coincided with the swing plane of the 
impact pendulum motion (Fig. 11(d)).

The newly introduced distance was proposed to characterize the degree of influence of a 
second stationary target on the immersed pendulum motion and was examined as a function of 
particle St in Fig. 15(a). Here, Re=ρDUP/μ is estimated at =3D since previous studies have 
concluded that hydrodynamic coupling becomes negligible if the interstitial distance is above 3D. 
Stronger hydrodynamic coupling is observed when the pendulum approaches at smaller StB, 
owing to a weaker particle inertia as compared to the viscous force. Similarly, increases in the 
target size have the same augmenting influence on the influence distance. In Fig. 15(b), the 
results obtained for the glass and the steel pendulum were shown separately, revealing similar 
trends but with a off-set. This observation suggests the significance of solid-to-fluid density ratio,

immersed spherical pendulum (see Fig. 17, Fig. 18(a)). High-speed imaging technique was 
employed with circular Hough transformation to study how the pendulum motion developed in 
identical liquid and from identical release angle, θ, can change with the wall spacing. Several 
ratios with W/D=1.2~5.0, scaled by pendulum diameter, were considered in this work and a 
typical set of data is compared in Fig. 18(b) and the primary wall effect is to retard the sphere 
motion. Special care was made to ensure that the pendulum did move in the middle of two planes

By using different pendulum release angles and the liquid viscosities, a wide range of 
maximum Re, from 4 to 295, has been achieved. The maximum Re drops with W/D at a degree 
degrading with liquid viscosity as shown in Fig. 20(a) but the lateral wall influence becomes 
negligible as W/D exceeds 3.0. A normalization using the maximum Re values at W/D=1.2 and

IV-2 Hydrodynamic force with boundary influence 
(IV-2-1) Develop a viscous flow model to describe the total hydrodynamic force acting on an 
immersed sphere in unsteady approach towards a solid wall at low Reynolds number 
-[SCI Journal publication] F.-L. Yang ―A formula for the wall-amplified added mass 
coefficient for a solid in normal approach to a wall and its application for such motion at 
low Reynolds number,‖ Physics of Fluids, 22, 123303 (2010 [58]) *A copy is provided 
in Appendix 1. 
 
Classical elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) theory considers only the quasi-steady 
lubrication force, FQD, to describe the motion of a fully immersed solid sphere in normal 
approach to a second solid surface. This formula has shown to be inadequate when the sphere 
particle Reynolds number, Re, is not in the creeping flow regime and liquid inertia effects have to 
been incorporated including Re-dependent modification of FQD and some unsteady components. 
The classical added mass force, FAM, and the Basset history force, FH, are often considered while 
the latter is a consequence of vorticity generation from an accelerating solid surface that  
interferes with the local boundary layer development which in turn to give an unsteady viscous 
force. Since the presence of a second nearby solid boundary modifies the potential flow around 
the other moving object, the boundary layer developed on the moving surface can thus differ 
from the case when moving in an infinite fluid domain. Thus, modifications on both the added 
mass force and the classical Basset force for the presence of other solid boundary are necessary.   
I re-examined the classical potential flow theory and revealed a severe under-estimation of a 
widely-employed wall modification on the classical results of the added mass coefficient given in 
the textbook of Milne-Thompson (1967) [57]. The wall-modified added mass coefficient 
becomes CAM(h
*
)=1/2(1+W(h
*
)) where W(h
*
) represents the wall correction function that depends 
on the radius-scaled sphere-to-wall distance h
*
 and its original form is an infinite series. A 
compact formula has been developed for W(h

which requires only algebraic calculations of the characteristic Re, γ, and an estimated traveled

It is found that the accumulated errors, <eAM> and <eH>, obtained numerically can be 
expressed by a linear function of the corresponding EAM and EH obtainable via algebraic 
calculations as

which are indicated by the two red dashed line segments in Fig. 23(a) and 23(b). The linear 
relationship is no longer valid when the pendulum density falls closely to the ambient liquid (γ= 
1.05 in this work) but an off-trend behavior (reaching a constant plateau) is observed with values 
varying with the flow conditions [59].

(IV-2-3) Instantaneous unsteady pressure measurement and a working formula

To achieve in-situ measurements pressure developed on the surface of an object in unsteady 
motion, a pressure transducers (GE Druck PDCR-81) was mounted to the end of the tube as 
illustrated in Fig. 24(a) with its lead wire threaded through the tube. This tube was then fixed 
onto the platform of the screw rail of a servo motor and the whole set was installed vertically on 
top of a water tank filled with water-glycerol liquid solution (see Fig. 24(b)). The tube and the 
25 
 
A working formula for the instantaneous pressure was sought in the form p(t)~ A U(t)|U(t)| + 
B dU/dt + C in terms of rod acceleration and velocity, dU/dt and U, and three constants. Note that 
the constants A and B are simply geometry factors that should depend solely on the object shape. 
In this expression, the first component is expect to correlate with the unsteady pressure 
component that generates the well-known added mass force for an immersed solid object in 
unsteady relative motion with the ambient fluid. The second entry corresponds to the quasi-steady 
dynamic pressure (refer to the velocity quadratic term in the Bernoulli‘s equation) along a 
streamline around the object, which accumulates into the form drag as part of the well-know 
quasi-steady drag.  
Here we describe how we estimate the desired constants. On Fig. 26, the synchronized time 
sequence of rod velocity and acceleration are shown with the sensor signal by the green, red, and 
blue lines, respectively. We first identify the particular instants, tA, when U(tA)=0 as marked by 
solid red circles. At these instants, p(tA)~BdU/dt + C and thus the corresponding pressure reading 
p(tA) is plotted as a function of instantaneous tube acceleration, dU(tA)/dt, in Fig.27(a) and the 
slope was fitted in a least-square sense to estimate the factor B. Similarly, the second scaling 
constant A is extrapolated by a linear fit to the pressure data, p(tB), and the square of the tube 
velocity U(tB)

 at the specific times tB when dU(tB)/dt=0, as shown in Fig. 27(b).

The sensing module is firstly immersed in Newtonian fluid and driven by a motion control 
system and a data acquisition system was set up to capture synchronized gage signal. Extensive 
efforts were made to calibrate the sensing modules using well-controlled fluid motions—a 
circular Couette flow or a linearly oscillation flow. For the first, a tri-axial strain gage was 
cemented on the inner wall of the acrylic cylindrical cup placed in an external glycerol bath to 
diminish temperature variation (see Fig. 28). The cylindrical cup was filled with viscous liquid of 
different viscosities μ and the liquid is driven by an inner rotor at a constant angular velocity, . 
By varying μ and , various steady inner flows could be generated which exerted different shear 
stress on the strain and thus resulted in different voltage output.  
        
Fig. 28 (a) Schematic diagram of the circular Couette flow apparatus: the concentric rotor and 
cylinder, and the gauge location on the inner and outer acrylic cylinder wall; (b) the measuring 
facility is immersed in an external glycerol bath to diminish temperature variation [65]. 
Fig. 29 shows the temporal evolution of the voltage signal (hence the local thermal strain) 
after the rotor was set into three constant ω = 5, 50, and 100 rpm. Each curve goes through a 
transient phase and settles to a steady plateau, suggesting the development of quasi-steady 
velocity and temperature fields. The magnitude of this plateau is referred to as the steady strain 
deviation, Δε. The steady strain data was examined as a function of ω and logω in Fig. 30(a) and 
(b), respectively, and a least-square fitting for the latter gives a linear correlation, Δε = -27.8 logω 
+ 4.96 as shown by the dashed line in both figures. Theoretical analysis has been conducting to 
describe the discovered relationship between Δε and ω and the desired flow stress field, which 
task will be tackled in the near future.

spontaneous plate oscillation velocity are shown in the bottom subfigures. The gauge readings on 
both the acrylic and the aluminum plates fluctuate about a mean that drops after the plate 
oscillation was activated due to forced thermal convection. The acrylic plate goes through a 
longer and milder transition and approaches a plateau Δε at the end. The gauge bond to the 
aluminum plate also displays fluctuating signals but with a nearly step-wise change into a much 
smaller plateau since heat is not easy to accumulate for its much higher thermal diffusivity and 
lower thermal expansion rate.

In addition to temporal analysis, the gauge response was further analyzed in the frequency 
domain via Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) using different segments of temporal data: 
t=10~50, 100~140, and 200~240 seconds. The resulting frequency spectrums are shown in Fig. 
33 and peaks were observed at the multiples of 0.2 Hz, with the largest at 0.4 Hz. This frequency 
is twice of the plate oscillation frequency, 0.2 Hz, indicating two heat convection peaks were 
developed in one oscillation cycle. This phenomenon suggests that the local heat convection 
induced by the forward and the backward plate motions are of comparable magnitudes and 
indistinguishable. Below 0.4 Hz, higher amplitude is observed in the acrylic spectrum of 10~50 
second, suggesting its longer transient phase. But for the spectrums of different segments in time, 
the peak amplitudes at 0.4 Hz have comparable magnitudes (with <2% variation). The peak

(IV-2-5) Develop facility for in-situ force measurements when a sphere approaches a solid

   -will contribute to a master thesis by 李峻華 (estimated 2012) 
A new set of facilities has been developed to study how the hydrodynamic force may change 
from FQD(Re) when a solid sphere approaches constantly and normally towards a wall. Following 
the proposal, we have manufactured a hollow aluminum sphere of external diameter of 15 cm on 
which four pressure transducers were installed from the interior at 0°, 45°, 90°, and 135° from the 
line of motion as shown in Fig. 36(a) (the arrow indicates the direction of the motion). The 
sphere was then connected to a stiff tube and the sphere-tube was affixed to the precision motor 
for motion control.

Laplace equation has been developed to deform the mesh as if its deformation satisfied the 
governing equation for thin plate. The linear partial differential equation is subjected to specific 
boundary conditions determined by the instantaneous body motion and other flow boundary 
conditions to ensure a body-fitted new mesh. The efficiency of the mesh regeneration algorithm is 
ensured by the linearity of the governing equation.  
The integrated numerical scheme was validated by the numerical results of four existing 
problems: a flow over a backward-facing step, a uniform flow over a fixed cylinder, the 
vortex-induced vibration of an elastic cylinder in uniformly incident flow, and a complementary 
problem that compares the transient drag coefficient for a cylinder impulsively set into motion to 
that measured on a fixed cylinder in a starting flow. Good agreement with the numerical or 
experimental data in the literature was obtained and new transient flow dynamics was revealed.  
We plan to extend this scheme to three-dimensional and plan to use the current 2D framework 
to investigate how the flow structure evolution corresponds to the hydrodynamic force and how 
this correlation changes with the presence of a second solid boundary. We plan to further extend 
to study how the finding correlates with the surface relative configuration which should integrate 
and consolidate our understanding of flow-body interaction.

Since most existing works on flow visualization focuses primarily on steady object motions, 
we started to look at how a vortex ring developed behind an unsteady pendulum and are 
particularly interested in how the evolution may be modified by a downstream target. Different 
from standard approaches that employs pulse laser to achieve particle image velocimetry (PIV) 
measurement, we attempted to use a continuous laser as the lighting source. A laser loop has been 
set up (see Fig. 38) to generate whole-field illumination in Fig. 39(a) by overlapping dual laser

instantaneous streamlines of the system. Black lines are the streamlines with target CB and the 
dashed lines show the cases withouth CB [67]. 
 
The force developed on both cylinders (with CB fixed or free) is monitored as a function of 
inter-cylinder distance in Fig. 42 (left and right, respectively) and discussed with respect to the 
vortex structure and strength and the target mobility. A greater force is measured when the vortex 
pair has stronger circulation and larger structure but such augmentation is more pronounced when 
the vortex pair is initially in moving Főppl saddle equilibrium. The target mobility greatly 
modifies the hydrodynamic force by reducing its magnitude and reversing the force ordering with 
respect to vortex pair structures. Detailed examination of how each singularity evolves within the 
dynamic system has been conducted on the current theoretical framework to gain insight to a real 
flow-body interaction problem.  
The ultimate goal of this work is to apply the knowledge from such inviscid theory to examine 
the findings from our PIV measurements in real viscous flow. This cross-examination also 
provides us a valuable means to evaluate how feasible an inviscid theory is under various flow 
conditions. The finding undoubtedly will contribute to the fundamental research of fluid 
mechanics.

A formula for the wall-amplified added mass coefficient for a solid sphere
in normal approach to a wall and its application for such motion
at low Reynolds number
F.-L. Yang
Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei 10617, Taiwan
Received 26 August 2009; accepted 15 October 2010; published online 13 December 2010
This work re-examines the potential flow theory for a sphere in normal approach to a wall, based on
the classical results derived by Lamb Hydrodynamics Dover, New York, 1932 and
Milne-Thomson Theoretical Hydrodynamics, 5th ed. Dover, New York, 1968. These authors
generated an expression in which the kinetic energy for a sphere in an unbounded fluid is augmented
by a wall correction function in terms of an infinite series that depends on the scaled center-to-wall
distance, h=h /a, with a denoting the sphere radius. By truncating the series at the order of h−3,
the resulting one-term correction function, 3 /8h−3, is widely employed to approximate the
wall-amplified added mass coefficient, CAMh, in multiphase flow research. Nonetheless, this work
shows that this one-term correction deviates greatly from corrections including higher order terms
when the interstitial gap drops below the half sphere radius. Thus, an explicit formula is developed,
for all h, using a near-wall Padé approximation, an intermediate bridging function, and a far-field
approximation. This proposed formula provides an efficient and reasonable approximation to the
infinite series and thus may serve as an improved wall correction function as compared to the
one-term formula. The developed formula is applied to compute the unsteady approach of a
nonrotating sphere toward a wall in a viscous fluid at low Reynolds number condition. In addition
to Brenner’s wall correction on the quasisteady viscous force H. Brenner, “The slow motion of a
sphere through a viscous fluid towards a plane surface,” Chem. Eng. Sci. 16, 242 1961, the
current formula is employed to modify both the added mass coefficient, from 1/2, and the history
force. This latter force is modified by integrating the wall-modified potential flow theory with the
boundary layer theory. If the one-term correction is used in the equation of motion, underestimation
of the sphere motion and the force magnitudes are observed. Lastly, the limiting value of the infinite
series derived by Lamb and Milne-Thomson as h→a is analytically evaluated, leading to a result in
terms of the generalized zeta function, 3,1. When this limiting value is compared to the one-term
correction at h=a, a 38% deficiency of the wall-augmented kinetic energy is revealed, resulting in
an underestimated CAMh that plays a crucial role in presenting the near-wall normal approach.

I. INTRODUCTION
The motion of a rigid sphere in an incompressible and
viscous fluid with the presence of a wall has been studied
extensively over the past few decades through theoretical
analysis, numerical simulations, and experimental investiga-
tions. The hydrodynamic force due to sphere translation is
often decomposed into a quasisteady viscous drag, an added
mass force, and a history force that results from unsteadily
developing boundary layer.1,2 Most efforts to account for the
presence of a wall have focused on modifying the quasi-
steady viscous force. The force is found to increase as the
sphere center-to-wall distance diminishes and the near-wall
behavior asymptotes to the lubrication force at sufficiently
small clearance.3–8 Investigations of the wall effect on the
history force, however, have been somewhat limited as com-
mended by Ardekani and Rangel8 and, to the best of the
author’s knowledge, the only correction that has been pro-
posed combines the boundary layer theory with a wall-
modified streamwise pressure gradient from potential flow
theory.9 The wall effect on the added mass force, in contrast,
is thought to be well understood, as it can be derived from
the potential flow theory.10,11 For a nonrotating sphere of
radius a that accelerates at dUp /dt toward a wall from a
center-to-wall distance h, the added mass force is frequently
described by FAM =1 /2mf1+3 /8h−3dUp /dt, where mf
denotes the liquid mass displaced by the sphere, h=h /a
is the scaled distance, and Up is the sphere instantaneous
velocity.2,8 The added mass coefficient, CAMh=1 /2mf
1+3 /8h−3, increases from the classical result, 1/2, de-
veloped for infinite fluid domain with diminishing h.
According to Lamb and Milne-Thomson, the wall ampli-
fication of FAM or CAM results directly from wall-modified
fluid kinetic energy that bears a correction term in terms of
an infinite series sum composed by superposing an infinite
array of image dipoles to satisfy the impermeable boundary
condition.10,11 The one-term expression, 1+3 /8h−3, is given
explicitly in the context of Milne-Thomson by truncating the
infinite series at the order of h−3. Thus, at small h, this
particular expression may predict a wall amplification effect
that deviates from the value described by the infinite series.

wall distance, h, is used rather than h until the last few
steps. The dependence of pn /qn on h and a is also omitted for
brevity.
A. Manipulations of the entry function of W„h…
Starting with p0=0 and q0=1, the next two continued
fraction functions can be expressed as

p1
q1
=
a
2h
=
a
2h − ap0/q0
,
p2
q2
=
a
2h − a2/2h
=
a
2h − ap1/q1
.
 4
By induction, a recurrence relation for pn /qn can be obtained
as
pn+1
qn+1
=
a
2h − apn/qn
=
aqn
2hqn − apn
,
which suggests
pn+1 = aqn, 5a
qn+1 = 2hqn − apn. 5b
Inserting pn=aqn−1 from Eq. 5a into Eq. 5b, an equation
that governs the consecutive qn can be found as
qn+1 − 2hqn + a2qn−1 = 0, 6
whose general solution may be expressed as qn=An+B	n,
where , 	, A, and B are to be determined. Using this gen-
eral solution, Eq. 6 can be reduced into
An−12 − 2h + a2 + B	n−1	2 − 2h	 + a2 = 0.
Thus,  and 	 can be obtained readily as the two solutions to
the quadratic equation, s2−2hs+a2=0, as
 =h + h2 − a2,
	 =h − h2 − a2. 7
The two unknown constants A and B in the general solution
qn=An+B	n can be determined by satisfying the specific
values of q0 and q1 as
q0 = A + B = 1 and q1 = A + B	 = 2h ,
where Eq. 5b has been employed to obtain the value of q1.
The quantity 2h in the last equation may be replaced by
+	 using Eq. 7. The two constants can then be found
easily as A= / −	 and B=−	 / −	, which leads to the
general expressions for pn and qn as
pn = 	
n − 	n
 − 	
,
qn =
n+1 − 	n+1
 − 	
,
 8
where both  and 	 are functions only of a and h. Note that
the relation 	=a2 from Eq. 7 has been adopted in deriv-
ing pn.
Using Eq. 2 in Eq. 1, the nth entry of the wall cor-
rection function may be expressed as the successive
multiplication of pi /qi3 from pn /qn3 to p1 /q13. The ob-
tained expression can be further simplified, by the relation
pn=aqn−1 in Eq. 5a, into
n
0
= 	an−1p1qn 

3
= 	  − 	
n+1 − 	n+1

3, 9
where = /a and 	=	 /a. In Eq. 9, the general formula
of pn and qn given in Eq. 8 have been exploited. Defining

h=	 /, the fraction in the rightmost expression in Eq.
9 can be further manipulated into
 − 	
n+1 − 	n+1
=
1
nk=0
n 
k
. 10
The  in the denominator of Eq. 10 can be expressed in
terms of 
 as =
−1/2, using the relation 	=1. A new
formulation for n /0 is thus obtained, leading to the fol-
lowing expression for the wall correction function:

f0d1+ f1=c1, and f0d2+ f1d1+ f2=c2. The M +N+1 unknown
coefficients are determined by solving these equations simul-
taneously. Note that x=0 has been used as the center of the
series expansion in deriving Eq. 15; if a Padé approxima-
tion for fx around x=x0 is desired, the result can be modi-
fied easily by changing the independent variable to x−x0 in
both Eqs. 14 and 15. Different f j then lead to a new set of
coefficient for PMNx−x0 near x0.
18
To develop a Padé approximation for Wh near the
wall, a power series expansion of W50h about h=1 was
first derived. The partial sum of 50 terms was chosen, instead
of W200h or W10h, to avoid enormous manipulations
while preserving acceptable accuracy. A Taylor series expan-
sion up to order h−111 was calculated for each entry and
the obtained series were summed to generate the desired
power series for W50h. For each series of order k
k11, all permissible PMNh−1, satisfying M +N=k,
were calculated and compared to W200h to evaluate the
goodness of fit. The best approximation was determined to
minimize the error at h=1 while at same time providing a fit
of error below 1% for 1h1.2.
In general, a PMNh−1 that utilizes power series of
higher orders provides a better fit to W200h. The degree of
improvement, however, slows down when the order of the
numerator or the denominator exceeds five. Thus, P56x,
where x=h−1, was chosen as a good compromise between
accuracy and compactness of expression to represent
W200h, and thus Wh, as
P56x =
0.605 605 + a1x + a2x2 + a3x3 + a4x4 + a5x5
1 + b1x + b2x2 + b3x3 + b4x4 + b5x5 + b6x6
,
16
where the numerator coefficients are a1=984.634,
a2=5.835105, a3=1.513108, a4=1.6061010, and
a5=4.7431011. The denominator power series has the co-
efficients b1=1642.3, b2=9.868105, b3=2.621108,
b4=2.9291010, b5=1.0271012, and b6=5.1121012.
The scaled error from the analytic limiting value at h=1,
W1− P561 /W1, is calculated to be as small as
9.3310−2%, identical to that computed for W501. How-
ever, the magnitude of the scaled error increases with h: for
example, a 2% deviation from W1 is found at h=1.2.
This necessitates the use of a different approximation away
from the wall.
B. Far-field expression and the composite formula
for W„h…
A natural choice for the far-field approximation is the
partial sum of fewer terms, such as W5h or W10h exam-
ined in Fig. 1b, since they quickly asymptote to W200h as
h increases. The five-term partial sum was selected for its
more compact form. A composite formula is thus desired to
represent Wh for all h1 employing P56h in the
near-field and W5h in the far-field. To ensure a continuous
matching, the locations where the two approximations agree
were first identified. The locations were obtained iteratively
to be h1

=1.0618 and h2

=1.1287. These are shown in Fig. 2
that portrays the deviation of P56h and W5h from
W200h after scaled by the value involving 200 terms. Em-
ploying h1
 and h2
 as the junction points, a bridging function,
Bh, is inserted between the near-field and the far-field ex-
pressions. To guarantee a smooth transition, the slope of
Bh was required to match that of P56h at h1
 and of
W5h at h2

. Thus, a third-order polynomial was employed
for Bh, with coefficients chosen to meet the following
conditions:
Bh1
 = P56h1
, Bh1
 = P56 h1
,
Bh2
 = W5h2
, and Bh2
 = W5h2
 .
The resulting formula is
Bh = − 26.8008h3 + 94.0442h2 − 110.95h
+ 44.2738. 17
Thus, a composite formula is proposed in this work to
represent the infinite series Wh for all h1 as
Wch = P56h
 , 1.0 h h1

,
Bh , h1
 h h2

,
W5h , h h2

.
 18
This composite formula is compared segmentwise to the nu-
merical result of W200h in Fig. 3a, showing close agree-
ment. Though Wch lies slightly below W200h for all h,
the underestimation never exceeds 0.4% as illustrated in
Fig. 3b where the scaled error is plotted.
The analytic added mass force, FAM =1 /2mf
1+WhdUp /dt, can now be approximated effectively
by FAM1 /2CAMhmfdUp /dt with a wall-modified added
mass coefficient, CAMh=1+Wch.
V. APPLICATION: NEAR-WALL APPROACH
IN A VISCOUS LIQUID
In this section, the proposed wall correction function,
Wch, is employed to simulate the approach of a solid
sphere toward a wall at small particle Reynolds number,
Re=2a fUp / f, where a and Up denote sphere radius and
velocity and  f and  f represent liquid density and viscosity.

with two boundary conditions: Ur=U=0 at the sphere sur-
face, y=0, and as y→, both velocities converge to the po-
tential free stream subjected to the same boundary geometry
and inflow conditions. When the flow unsteadiness is limited
to low frequency as considered by Mei and Adrian, the time
derivative in the momentum equation may be neglected. The
Euler equation commonly adopted to estimate the stream-
wise pressure gradient can also be simplified to give
−1 / fdp /dx=UedUe /dx with Ue denoting the tangential ve-
locity of the potential stream. The Blasius series method is
then applied to represent rx, Uex, and a stream function,
x ,y, as power series of x. Note that this x ,y gives
U=1 /r r /y and Ur=−1 /r r /x to solve the conti-
nuity equation.
For a nonrotating sphere that moves at Up in an infinite
liquid domain, Uex=−3 /2Up sinx /a in the body-fixed
reference frame. Let Rc=a and Uc=3 /2Up be the character-
istic length and velocity scales, rx=Rckrkxk and Uex
=−Uckukxk, where rk=uk are the power series coefficients
of the sine function and thus only odd k remains. The stream
function is then sought in a particular form as

where 
=y2Uc / fRc is a similarity variable. Substituting
the power series of rx, Uex, and x ,
 into the mo-
mentum equation and collecting terms preceding x of like
powers, a set of coupled differential equations can be ob-
tained relating fk
 and its derivative with respect to 
 to
the known uk and rk. Using the flow boundary conditions at

 have been solved numerically and
tabulated up to x7 in Schlichting, which order was evaluated
sufficient to approximate the flow over a sphere.20
b. Current analysis. With U=1 /r r /y, the shear

s3=0.0379, are evaluated here using the second derivative of
fk at the surface, fk0, tabulated in Schlichting.20 Consider-
ing a one-to-one correlation between  and FH, it is proposed
that a possible wall effect on FH can be evaluated by consid-
ering a wall-modified potential velocity with the potential
flow analysis as follows.
According to Lamb,10 the velocity potential function in-
duced by a solid sphere of radius a in normal approach at Up
toward a wall from h can be expressed as

The subscript W indicates a wall-inclusion case. Using

where U0r ,=−a3Up sin  /2r3 and Ur0r ,=−a3Up
cos  /r3 are the classical results considering an infinite
fluid domain. When r=a, Eq. 27 can be greatly simplified
into
Ua,,h = U0a,1 + Wh and
28
Ura, = Ur0a, .
The surface tangential velocity is found to increase mono-
tonically from the no-wall result when h diminishes, in the
same manner as how fluid kinetic energy is augmented by
the wall. On the contrary, the radial velocity agrees with the
no-wall value, validating the no-penetration boundary condi-
tion. Since Ur , ,h exhibits the same surface distribution
as the no-wall result, an augmentation factor is thus defined
by dividing Ua , ,h by U0a ,, which turns out to be
the wall-modified added mass coefficient and can be ap-

by the full model may be attributed to a larger M ,h that
counteracts the liquid hindering forces more effectively.
Large Up
0 also results in greater deviation in both the h
− t and the Up

−h profiles since the induced hydrodynamic
forces are of greater magnitudes on which the deficiency of
W1h is more pronounced. The difference is milder for the
slowest case using Up
0=0.1 owing to the nearly quasi-
steady nature of this slow approach. When the temporal evo-
lution of the three hydrodynamic forces are compared in Fig.
7a, FV is found to dominate. Since FV is independent of
Wh, the resulting sphere motion is thus less sensitive to
the deficiency of W1h. The influence of an inaccurate wall
correction term is further diminished when gravity, as the
other force component that is independent of Wh, is in-
cluded in the model. This explains why the one-term and the
full models give nearly identical profiles for the gravity-
included Up
0=0.1 case in Figs. 5a and 6a but deviations
are found for the slow approaches without gravity in the
corresponding b subplots.
Now, the force temporal profiles are examined.
To complement the results shown in Fig. 7a for the
slowest approach, those obtained for the fastest motion at
Up
0=10.0 are presented in Fig. 7b. For better illustration,
the three force components are scaled by the initial value of
the quasi-steady viscous force, FV0, and the magnitudes of
these scaled forces are presented on a logarithmic time scale.
Note that all the forces are already nondimensional, scaled
by mfUT
2 /2a, before the division by FV0 but the asterisk
sign has been omitted for a clearer expression. A plus and a
minus sign are added to indicate whether the force directs
along or against Up

. When the force profiles fall too closely
to each other, a separate inset is inserted for examination at a
finer scale. The force temporal profiles for other approaches
fall between those developed in these two limiting cases and
thus are not repeated. It is found that the one-term model
always predicts smaller FVt, FAMt, and FHt
throughout the approach and the deficiency is more pro-
nounced for the fastest approach. The underestimation of
FVt corresponds to a smaller Up
 predicted by the one-
term model. The weaker resultant deceleration integrates
with a consistently smaller wall-augmentation factor in the
one-term model to generate a smaller FAMt and FHt.
To provide a qualitative comparison, the force components
calculated by the one-term model was scaled by the values
obtained from the full model throughout each approach; a
ratio close to 100% indicates that the results using W1h
approaches that with Wch and the deviation thus charac-

that exhibited by the light sphere and thus are not presented.
The deviation between the two model predictions on the
sphere motion is milder due to a smaller proportion of
Wch or W1h in M ,h. Nonetheless, the deficiency in
the one-term model force prediction is severer since the wall
correction effect is more pronounced on the faster Up
 in-
duced by a greater sphere inertia. Further, as found in the
light sphere motion, the presence of gravity has no strong
effect on the degree of force deviation between the two mod-
els. Thus, only the gravity-excluded force evolution is exam-
ined and different profiles from that portrayed in Fig. 7 for
the light sphere are observed for fast approaches. The results
obtained for the cases using Up
0=5.0 and 10.0 are pre-
sented in Figs. 8a and 8b, respectively. The fast heavy
sphere possesses sufficient inertia, in relation with large
M ,h and Up
0, to overcome the hindering force which
delays the sharp decline of Up
t. The wall augmentation
factor, h, can thus take effect before Up
t drops to a
small value and a FVh peak is generated during the ap-
proach. A sudden rise of sphere deceleration occurs corre-
spondingly to generate an immediate jump of FAMt and a
later peak of FHt.
Further, the simulation results obtained for the heavy
sphere approaches at Up
0=5.0 and 10.0, with or without
gravity, were scrutinized to compare the maximum force
magnitudes following the analysis for the light sphere. The
maximum predicted by the one-term model was scaled by
that obtained from the full model and the ratio is presented in
Table II to show its performance. The maximum FV, FAM,
and FH calculated by the full model are also listed for ref-
erence. In comparison to the 11% force deviation upper
bound found in FH during the gravity-excluded light sphere
motion, the one-term model has poorer performance in cap-
turing the full model force predictions for the heavy sphere.
At Up
0=10.0, the one-term model predicts maximum FAM
and FH that are 15% and 20% smaller than the full model
values. Other than the degraded one-term model perfor-
mance, the nature of each force remained similar to what
have commented for the light sphere approach, despite the
presence or absence of gravity.
c. Sphere rest time. A second evaluation of the model
performance was performed by examining the predicted rest
time to terminate an approach. As delineated before, a veloc-
ity condition, Up
10−3, or a distance threshold, =h−1
10−4, was employed alternatively to determine a halted
motion, depending on which occurs first. Let tWc and
tW1 denote the rest times estimated from the full and the
one-term models, an error percentage can be defined as
E= tW1 − tWc / tWc100%. Since the initial velocity has been
shown to greatly affect the model performance, a wider
range of Up
0, from 0.1 to 40, was considered using identi-
cal initial position. Sphere motions at such a high velocity
may occur in real applications involving particle injection or
post-collision rebounds from other objects. The examined
velocity upper bound is limited by the maximum particle
Reynolds number, Re=50, allowed for the use of KMAt.
Further, note that this extension of Up
0 does not invalidate
Brenner’s wall correction since the required condition of
small gap Reynolds number is satisfied by the closeness of
h0 that gives 0.13. Figure 9 plots the obtained error
percentage as a function of Up
0. The results for =1.05
with and without gravity are presented by the solid and the
open square lines, ,; those for gravity-included and-
excluded cases with =5.0 are shown by the solid and the
open circle lines, ,.
It is found that the one-term model overestimates the rest
time for all the gravity-included cases as portrayed by the
lines with solid symbols. For the light sphere , the

the sphere motion, the hydrodynamic forces, and the rest
time predicted by using W1h or Wch in the equation of
motion. The case using W1h generally shows slower ap-
proach, smaller hydrodynamic forces, and longer travel time
before the sphere arrives at wall. The deviation of the forces
and the rest time predicted with W1h can be as high as
25% and 50%, respectively, necessitating the usage of a
higher order approximation. In addition to model evaluation,
the interplay between the hydrodynamic forces embedded in
this dynamic problem is also discussed.
Lastly, noting that the entry of Wh takes the form of
a continued fraction function, the unique property of this
special function has been exploited to express W1 analyti-
cally in terms of the generalized zeta function, 3,1. Since
Wh increases monotonically with diminishing h, the
limiting value, W1 given in Eq. 13, can be used to
evaluate an error upper bound of any approximation of the
infinite series sum.

and to meet the boundary condition. To estimate the hydrodynamic force and torque 37
on the objects, the Blasius theorem can be employed∧, which considers the rate of 38change of fluid impulse. The resulting formulae are often expressed in terms of 39
the flow potential function since its gradient gives the velocity field required when 40
using the Bernoulli equation to derive the surface pressure distribution (Lamb 1932; 41
Milne-Thompson 1968). 42
On this thread of research, Lagally (1922) developed a three-dimensional theorem 43
that describes the quasi-steady hydrodynamic force and torque for an immersed 44
object in terms of the strengths and positions of the singularities employed to 45
generate specific flow fields. Lagally’s work was extended later by Cummins (1953) 46
to incorporate unsteady flow condition. These derivations were consolidated by 47
Landweber & Yih (1956), who took an alternative but powerful approach to give the 48
three-dimensional force and the torque expressions by employing only the singularities, 49
isolated or distributed, within the body. The theorem for the case with deformable 50
bodies in unsteady flow was considered by Landweber & Miloh (1980); a shorter and 51
simpler derivation for a body in translation was given by Biesheuvel (1985). These 52
authors also connected their results to the Taylor theorem∧, which represents the added 53mass tensor of an immersed translating object using the strengths and the locations of 54
its internal singularities (Taylor 1928; Birkhoff 1950; Landweber 1956; Landweber & 55
Yih 1956; Landweber & Chwang 1989). The advantage of using internal singularities 56
is especially appreciated in problems with multiple objects when the hydrodynamic 57
force on each individual body is of interest. Such information is not available from the 58
conventional Lagally theorem, since it gives a lumped sum of the hydrodynamic forces 59
from all the objects. So far, only dipoles and isolated or distributed sources have been 60
considered, and the inclusion of two-dimensional free vortices, or vortex filaments in 61
three-dimensional flows, has been neglected. Thus, the main purpose of this ∧paper 62is to extend the two-dimensional Lagally theorem by considering free vortices, as a 63
supplement to the work of Landweber & Yih (1956). 64
To validate the current extension, the generalized Lagally theorem has been applied 65
to study the interaction of a free solid cylinder with single or paired free vortices of 66
opposite strengths following the literature. In particular, the pair of free vortices of 67
opposite strengths will be referred to as a vortex pair hereinafter. Eames, Landeryou 68
& Flo´r (2007) studied such a problem under the condition of zero total flow impulse. 69
Shashikanth et al. (2002) and Borisov, Mamaev & Ramodanov (2003) independently 70
employed the Hamiltonian mechanics to derive the equation of motion for a cylinder 71
that interacts with multiple free vortices. Shashikanth (2006) simplified the formulation 72
for the problem when a vortex pair moves behind a ∧neutrally buoyant cylinder. This 73problem is known as the classical moving Fo¨ppl ∧problem, to which Shashikanth 74studied the ∧vortex–cylinder interaction and possible system equilibrium configurations. 75All the reported dynamic equations and system dynamics can be reproduced with 76
the current theorem. We further examine the system equilibrium configuration by 77
considering different solid densities and vortex strengths. 78
We then continue to two-cylinder problems, limiting ourselves to the condition when 79
one approaches constantly to the other of identical size and of liquid density. When 80
the target is fixed, several theoretical analyses have been conducted to examine the 81
hydrodynamic force developed on each cylinder on different theoretical frameworks. 82
The work by Landweber & Shahshahan (1991) is derived ∧in the framework of 83Lagrangian mechanics, which is further integrated with the generalized Taylor theorem 84
(Landweber & Chwang 1989); Wang (2004) and Bampalas & Graham (2008) use the 85
extended Blasius theorem (Milne-Thompson 1968); and Tchieu, Crowdy & Leonard 86

frames, Z and z, are related by Z = Zo + eiθz, where θ is the angle between OX1 and 119
ox1. In the following derivations, variables in the moving reference frame and any 120
function in terms of the variables therein will be denoted with ∧over-tilde. 121
The flow field, ∧˜v = v˜1 + iv˜2, is irrotational in OX1X2 and can be described by 122
v˜ = −dw˜/dz, where the complex velocity potential, ∧˜w = φ˜ + iψ˜ , is composed of the 123
potential and the stream functions, φ˜ and ψ˜ . The bar over a complex variable denotes 124
its conjugate. The pressure equation in the moving frame can be expressed as 125

+ 12q2r −
∂φ˜
∂t
− 12(U˜ + iΩz) (U˜ + iΩz)= E(t), (2.1) 126
where p˜ is the pressure, ρ is the constant fluid density, ∧qr = |v˜ − U˜ − iΩz| is the 127
flow speed relative to ox1x2, and ∧E(t) is a time-dependent function. The hydrodynamic 128
force exerted on the body can be calculated by integrating the hydrodynamic pressure 129
distribution around the object contour, C , as 130

(U˜ + iΩ z˜c), (2.2) 132
where z˜c is the centroid of the body and md is the mass of fluid displaced by the body. 133
This force formula is known as the extended Blasius theorem and can be reduced to 134
the conventional Blasius theorem, i.e. the first term on the right-hand side of (2.2), 135
when the object is fixed in space and the flow is steady (Milne-Thompson 1968). Now, 136
we proceed to derive the generalized Lagally theorem with free vortices. 137
Through integration by parts, the quantity in the second term on the right-hand side 138
of (2.2) becomes
∫
C
z dw˜= zw˜|C −
∫
C
w˜ dz, which may be simplified by the properties 139
of internal singularities. These singularities are either images imposed to satisfy the 140
no-penetration boundary condition or those adopted to generate an object motion. We 141
first consider N image sources and M image vortices at zsj and z
v
j within C whose 142
complex potential functions are w˜sj (z)=−mj ln(z− zsj ) and ∧˜wvj (z)= iκj ln(z− zvj ), where 143
mj and κj are individual singularity strengths. If za is a branch cut point on C , one 144
internal source contributes ∧−2piimjza to zw˜|C because its potential is multi-valued. 145
Adopting the same branch cut point, an internal image vortex generates −2piκjza. Note 146
here that if a different branch point is employed, the same result can still be obtained. 147
Thus, ∧zw˜|C =−2piza
(
i
∑N
j=1mj +
∑M
j=1κj
)
in which
∑N
j=1mj = 0 for mass conservation. 148
Further,
∑M
j=1κj = 0 since an external free vortex always generates a pair of image 149
vortices of opposite signs within C . Note that zw˜|C vanishes for any internal dipole 150
of strength µj at zdj since zw˜
d
j , with w˜
d
j (z) = µj/(z − zdj ), is single-valued around C . 151
Note that the present conclusion ∧that zw|C = 0 no longer holds when internal sources 152
or vortices are employed to create particular object dynamics, such as volume or 153
shape change not considered in the current study. Further, when an external vortex is 154
shed from the object, a bounded vortex of opposite sign should be generated within 155
C in addition to the aforementioned image vortices (Saffman 1992). The object thus 156
possesses circulation, and this scenario is also excluded in this work. 157

The first term on the right-hand side of (2.8) is dynamically equivalent to the quasi- 197

the added mass force, Aαj dUα/dt, for unsteady object motion but remains non-zero 199
for a steady object due to Uα dAαj/dt. This latter force component arises ∧as a result 200of changes in object relative configuration. The last term of (2.8) accounts for the 201

The function ∧fj = −d(w − wj)/dZ in the first summation is the flow velocity induced 209by all the other singularities at an internal singularity location Zj. Thus, each fj is 210
different and will be referred to as the partial velocity function hereinafter. Note that 211
the first summation in (2.9) is executed on all the singularities within C but the 212
last group contains only the contributions of the internal image singularities, specially 213
∧marked by img beneath the summation sign. The singularities employed to generate 214the body motion are not considered in the last summation since their effects have been 215
accounted for in the second term. In comparison to the conventional Lagally theorem∧, 216which gives force in three dimensions (Lagally 1922; Cummins 1953; Landweber & 217
Yih 1956; Biesheuvel 1985), (2.9) is two-dimensional and new force components due 218
to free vortices are found. 219
3. Problems with one cylinder 220
In this section, (2.9) is first applied to derive the equation of motion for a single 221
cylinder interacting with Nv free vortices and applied to two literature problems to 222
validate our force formula. 223
3.1. Equations of motion 224
Consider a non-rotating cylinder of radius a and density ρs moving at velocity 225
∧U = U1 + iU2 with Nv free vortices of strengths κj at Zvj . The resulting complex 226potential can be expressed following (2.4) as 227

where Γ = 2piκ is the circulation of the free vortex. Hence, the evolution trajectories 264
for the point vortex and the cylinder presented in their work (figure 1) can be exactly 265
reproduced. 266
3.3. With a vortex pair: the moving Föppl problem 267
Next, we consider the moving Fo¨ppl ∧problem, where a pair of vortices of opposite 268strengths, κ1 = −κ2 = κ , ∧move behind a non-rotating cylinder of radius a and density 269
ρs along OX1 at velocity U, as depicted in figure 2. This vortex pair is in a symmetric 270
configuration with respect to OX1 with a half-span of H and a horizontal distance D 271
from Zc. The complementary set-up where ∧a uniform flow passes a fixed cylinder with 272a stationary downstream vortex pair is the classic Fo¨ppl problem, well examined in 273
the literature (Fo¨ppl 1913; Milne-Thompson 1968; Marshall 2001). The moving Fo¨ppl 274
problem appears in a few recent works that treat it as a perturbation problem, as 275
introduced below. 276
Firstly, Shashikanth et al. (2002) develop a model for the interaction between 277
a ∧neutrally buoyant cylinder and N free vortices in a potential flow using the 278Hamiltonian mechanics. Later, Shashikanth (2006) considers the case with only a unit 279
vortex pair and evaluates how the system total momentum, L0, modifies the equilibrium 280
configuration of the vortex pair and the cylinder based on their relative motion. We 281
extend the analysis by considering how the solid-to-fluid density ratio, γ = ρs/ρ, and 282
the vortex strength, κ , alter the system equilibrium configuration. Here, we only probe 283
the relative motion between the top vortex and the moving cylinder. 284
The equation of motion for the cylinder can be readily obtained by substituting 285
κ1 =−κ2 = κ and Zv1 = Zv2 = Zv into (3.4) as 286

where ∧ˆZ

have opposite strengths, their image vortices at the cylinder centre mutually cancel out 289
upon superposition. The top vortex moves with the flow velocity induced at Zv by all 290
the other singularities as 291

Shashikanth (2006), the lower and the upper ones are referred to as the moving normal 315
line saddle (4) and centre (∧©), respectively, as marked in figure 3(c). 316To fully understand how the system parameters L0, γ and κ may control the 317
equilibrium configuration, two bifurcation plots were generated in figures 4(a) and 4(b) 318
with either κ or γ kept constant. On both plots, ∧regimes I, II ∧and III indicate the 319situation when no, two ∧or four equilibrium points can be developed, like the cases 320portrayed in figure 3(a–c), respectively. Note that Eames et al. (2007) also studied the 321
influence of γ on the ∧vortex–cylinder interaction in this system with unit κ and zero 322
L0. Their equation of ∧motion can also be reconstructed exactly by setting κ = 1 and 323
L0 = 0 in (3.9). 324

4.1. Problem set-up and the governing equation 326
To demonstrate how the current Lagally theorem may be exploited to study more 327
complex problems, a second cylinder of identical size, CB, is introduced downstream 328

from ZA, we used Nd = Nv = 50 and κ = 1 to generate a new flow as shown by the 366

for the five vortex pairs but of a minute magnitude around 10−5 and this perturbation 418

both cylinders are now distinguished by CdA and CdB and examined as a function of c 420
for a fixed or a free CB. 421

We first examine the case when CB is fixed. The force coefficients are depicted 423

plus or a minus sign is added to indicate whether the force is positive or negative 425
(noting that UA = −1). The evolution profiles without the free vortex pair are also 426
plotted by the ∧open circles to elucidate the influence of the vortex pair. When the 427vortex pair is initially at the Fo¨ppl centre (CI and CII), the force coefficients of both 428
cylinders evolve with c in a manner very similar to that developed without vortices. 429
However, when starting in the Fo¨ppl saddle equilibrium (SI–SIII), the vortex pair has 430

and the structure size of the vortex pair. For example, the time for contact with the 458
vortex pair in SI, SII ∧and SIII configurations increases slightly from 28.99 to 29.63 459and 30.35. The respective target velocity grows to UB = −0.05 at c = 6.93, 9.55 and 460
11.94 and reaches its peak of −0.34, −0.42 and −0.48 at c = 2.01. These values are 461
to be compared with the values measured when CB is fixed. Such a positive correlation 462
between the induced target motion and the vortex strength and structure is attributed to 463
∧the fact that the greater fluid impulse carried by a stronger and larger vortex pair can 464modify the flow around CB more effectively. Such force augmentation with the vortex 465
structure can also be inferred from ∧figure 9 ∧in Shashikanth (2006), where the object 466acceleration is examined. 467

respect to c give dA/dc < 0 and dA∗/dc > 0. Thus, when UB = 0, (4.7) is reduced to 501
−U2A dA/dc, giving a positive contribution to FA∧, as opposed to UA = −1 as revealed 502in figure 8. When CB is set into a negative motion, this positive term diminishes for 503
|UA − UB| < |UA|. Further, with |UA| > |UB| for the current cases, the second term in 504
(4.7) is negative, which acts with the last negative term to further degrade the total 505
hindering FA. At the same separation, such diminishing effect is more pronounced 506
when the vortex pair strength and structure are greater, since the induced UB is larger 507
(see figure 9b). Thus, the SIII case results in the lowest CdA in figure 10. It is also the 508
deviation in the target cylinder motion that renders deviating CdB evolution profiles in 509
that particular ordering. 510
Lastly, it is noted that CdB always exceeds CdA, and the difference is larger when 511
CB is free to move. This phenomenon is explained here by the behaviour of the first 512
two components in (4.7) that dominate the total hydrodynamic force on both cylinders. 513
When CB is fixed, this component contributes −U2A dA/dc to FA and −U2A dA∗/dc to 514
FB, and it is the fact that |dA∗/dc| > |dA/dc| when c > 2.0 that renders |FB| > |FA|. 515
According to the definition of A and A∗, the largest ∧components in dA
∗/dc and 516
dA/dc are dµ1/dc and dµ2/dc, respectively. The fact that the consecutive image 517
dipole strength decays rapidly with increasing separation suggests a much greater 518
|dA∗/dc| than |dA/dc| at large c and hence we observe |FB| > |FA| in figure 8. 519
Now, the opposite occurs for the forces induced by a non-zero UB, since the image 520
system generated in CA now depends on dµ1/dc and the consecutive terms with odd 521
indices and their sum would exceed that formed in CA. The two image dipole systems 522
generated for UA and UB would compensate each other since the two cylinders move 523
in the same direction. Thus, for CA, the smaller force due to the weaker UA-induced 524
image system is now counteracted by a stronger UB∧-induced image system; the force 525from the stronger UA-induced image system in CB is only reduced by a smaller 526
amount due to the weaker UB∧-induced image system. Consequently, a larger deviation 527between CdA and CdB is observed in figure 10 with a free CB than that revealed in 528
figure 8. 529
5. Conclusions and remarks 530
In this work, the two-dimensional Lagally theorem that describes the hydrodynamic 531
force on a solid object moving in an inviscid and incompressible fluid has been 532
extended successfully to include free vortices. An explicit force formula has been 533
derived in terms of the properties of the singularities employed to create the motion 534
of the body and the ambient flow structure and to ensure the no-penetrating boundary 535
condition. One advantage of the current force formula is that it requires only algebraic 536
manipulation, provided that the object shape and its boundary condition can be 537
handled with the potential flow theory. Nonetheless, the true merit is appreciated in a 538
multi-body problem where the individual force can be obtained using the respective 539

on a ﬁnite difference mesh with some of the vertices moving with the ﬂuid (Lagrangian), some staying ﬁxed (Eulerian), and
some being advanced by certain user-speciﬁed manners. Such a spatially coupled scheme preserves the accuracy in a
Lagrangian scheme (automatic mass conservation) and the stability in Eulerian models (non-deformed mesh elements).
However, the Lagrangian description requires a body-ﬁtted mesh that may deform or tangle when dramatic boundary
motion occurs during the simulation, which can pose serious problems to scheme stability. The deformed mesh may further
degrade the computation efﬁciency since the minimum element size sets the upper bound of the allowed simulation time
step. Thus, various algorithms have been proposed for mesh regulation or update in simulations that encounter noticeable
mesh deformation. Nonetheless, these algorithms are either complicated in nature or require multiple transformations be-
tween coordinate systems, which leads to arduous implementations. In some schemes, the new mesh cannot be generated
after rounds of iterations, which may degrade the scheme efﬁciency [6,8,9]. Thus, in this paper, we propose an efﬁcient and
simple algorithm for mesh regeneration to ensure that most FEM triangle elements are of nice shapes throughout a two-
dimensional ALE simulation of incompressible ﬂows with moving solid boundary.
To solve the unsteady Navier–Stokes equations, this work employs a conventional operator-splitting scheme, also known
as the fractional-step or the time-splitting scheme [10]. This method decouples the continuity and the momentum equation by
treating the time and the space derivative operators at different simulation steps. A virtual intermediate velocity ﬁeld is ﬁrst
estimated from the ﬂow ﬁeld at the previous time steps and then adopted to predict a pressure ﬁeld for the next time step.
The new pressure ﬁeld and the intermediate velocity ﬁeld are employed to update the velocity ﬁeld, under the condition of
overall mass conservation. In implementation, various difference schemes have been proposed in the literature and we
adopted a mixed explicit–implicit stifﬂy-stable scheme that is second-order accurate, following Karniadakis et al. [11]. This
scheme computes the non-linear convective term in an explicit manner to preserve numerical accuracy and calculates the
highest spatial differentiation with an implicit method to maintain scheme stability. Further, we have incorporated the bal-
ancing tensor diffusivity (BTD) to reduce the numerical error in calculating the convective term, following Gresho et al. [12].
The integrated Navier–Stokes equations solver is introduced in the ﬁrst part of Section 2, followed by the new mesh
regeneration algorithm and implementation details. In Section 3, the Navier–Stokes equations solver is ﬁrst validated by
reproducing the results of two standard test cases: (1) a ﬂow over a backward-facing step and (2) a ﬂow past a ﬁxed circular
cylinder. Another two problems with signiﬁcant boundary displacements are then considered to evaluate the overall perfor-
mance of the current numerical scheme: (3) the vortex induced vibration (VIV) problem where a uniform ﬂow passes a
transversely oscillating cylinder and (4) a dual problem that compares the transient drag coefﬁcient developed on a ﬁxed
cylinder when a uniform ﬂow impinges on it to that measured on an identical cylinder that undergoes a step motion in a
quiescent ﬂow. Satisfactory agreements with the existing literature data were obtained for all these problems, validating
the developed numerical scheme. The scheme is further evaluated in Section 4 by examining its performance with respect
to the controlling parameter in the mesh regeneration algorithm. The methodology of how to choose a feasible value for the
controlling parameter is also introduced in Section 4. Lastly, Section 5 concludes this study and suggests topics for future
research.

where M is number of the boundary nodes assigned on C and Dsi = jCj/M is the evenly divided arc length of C. The spatial
derivatives of u and v in Eq. (10) can be readily calculated following a standard FEM procedure as described in Appendix A.
2.2. Generation of a body-ﬁtted FEM mesh
Before the new mesh generation algorithm is introduced, an overall mesh quality number is proposed to measure, in an
averaged sense, how severely a local mesh is distorted around a moving object. A constant threshold value can then be as-
signed to determine when to initiate the mesh regeneration process in a consistent manner during a ﬂow simulation.
2.2.1. Mesh quality number
For a triangular FEMmesh, it is a general rule that near equilateral triangles are preferred elements to those in narrow and
wide shapes. By fundamental geometry, triangles close to an equilateral triangle also possess nearly matching internal an-
gles. Thus, the difference between p/3 and one of the internal angles, /i, can indicate how severely a triangle deviates from an
equilateral triangle as illustrated in Fig. 2. A total deviation angle is deﬁned as the sum

2.2.2.1. Selection of new boundary nodes. A primary mesh is ﬁrst generated to ﬁll the whole ﬂow domain bounded by the outer
boundary, Cext, including the space occupied by the circle. Given the instantaneous center location, the circumference C is
found to intersect with a subset of primary mesh elements which will be referred to as the boundary elements and are shaded
in Fig. 4. A search routine is now described to determine which nodes of these boundary elements shall be shifted onto C to
generate a new body-ﬁtted mesh.
First, for a cylinder of radius R, a concentric annulus with a 0.5R and 1.5R inner and outer radii is deﬁned as sketched in
Fig. 5(a). For all the boundary elements that fall completely in this annulus, the distance between each of its three vertices to
the circle center is calculated. For each element, the two vertices that possess the shortest and the longest distance, dmin and
dmax, are identiﬁed. If dmin < dmax, the two vertices fall on the alternative sides of the circumference C. The vertex possessing
dmin falls within C and is chosen as one boundary node candidate to be moved outwards onto C. There are slim chances for a
boundary node candidate to fall right on C and such node is deﬁnitely chosen. The search starts from an arbitrary ray and
scans around the annulus in a counter-clockwise direction and a subset of the boundary node candidates located near the
lower-left quarter of C is shown in Fig. 5(b).
It is observed that the current search algorithmmay pick up redundant candidates as what occurred in the boxed element
d. A local elimination process then proceeds to remove redundant vertices. Firstly, we deﬁne redundancy on the vertex that is
not connected to any boundary node candidate identiﬁed in the adjacent elements. For example, in Fig. 5(c), the vertices 1–3
are selected as boundary node candidates in element dwhile K1 and K2 are chosen in the adjacent elements. Since vertices 1
and 2 are individually connected to K1 and K2, these two d-element vertices are kept in the elimination process and only
vertex 3 is removed. The ﬁnal collection of boundary node candidates are then joined to form an approximate object contour,eC, within the cylinder which is a connected polyline composed of primary element edges as that portrayed in Fig. 6(a).
Fig. 4. Primary FEM mesh generated over the entire computation domain and a portion around the cylinder contour, C, is shown. The boundary elements
are in gray shade.

can be solved to achieve a second global stretch of the primary mesh nodes after their global displacement adjustments.
2.2.2.3. Remarks. Note that the stretch of the primary mesh may be interpreted as an in-plane deformation of a virtual mem-
brane that satisﬁes the force balance equation, rT + B = 0, according to linear elasticity. In this equation, T denotes the vir-
tual stress tensor and the virtual body force B is set to zero since the mesh possesses no physical substance. A simple
constitutive relation is then employed to describe T as a linear function of a virtual strain ﬁeld, e, which quantity is further
assumed to scale with the divergence of the general displacement ﬁeld, D(/,X), as e rD. Here, / and X are two linearly
independent components of an in-plane displacement ﬁeld. The force balance equation can thus be manipulated to give
the two Laplace equations, Eqs. (13a) and (13b). After discretization, these Laplace equations can be solved readily by the
same Bi-CGSTAB method employed before. Such a two-step mesh deformation-namely the radial stretch of eC onto C and
the angle adjustment from hi to h

i -has been implemented to adjust the eC depicted in Fig. 6(a) and the result is shown in
Fig. 6(d), conﬁrming the exact ﬁt.
Note that the current algorithm selects the primary nodes within C that possess the shortest distance to C among its
neighbors. Such a minimum distance condition automatically produces an approximate contour eC that possesses a total
length jeCj close to the cylinder circumference, jCj = pD. The number of mesh nodes that fall on eC, may change between con-
secutive regeneration procedures and the resulting body-ﬁtted mesh may thus possess different number of boundary nodes,
M, along C at different simulation steps. Such discretization variation leads to temporal ﬂuctuation of Ds in the computation
of FD and FL in Eq. (10). Nevertheless, by use of a sufﬁciently ﬁne primary mesh, the approximate eC can approach C to a sat-
isfactory degree, indicating that the variation of the boundary node number may be minute.
Further, instead of using only the internal vertexes, an optimal approximation that possesses the closest side length to jCj
may be constructed using both the internal and the external vertexes of the boundary elements. Such an optimal contour
may reduce the in-plane stretching of the primary mesh to give a new body-ﬁtted mesh of better quality. However, for appli-
cations with multiple objects, stretching of the vertexes exterior to the object surfaces may reduce the spatial resolution of
the interstitial mesh, degrading the spatial resolution for ﬂow simulation.
2.3. Summary of the numerical procedure
To recapitulate, the current numerical scheme solves the Navier–Stokes equations by the operator-splitting method on an
unstructured FEM mesh and the ALE method has been employed to handle a moving solid boundary. To maintain the struc-
ture of the deforming mesh, a mesh regeneration procedure has been proposed and integrated into the ALE scheme. Fig. 7
presents the ﬂow chart that indicates how ﬂow variables are manipulated in the ALE scheme, how mesh elements are han-
dled in the regeneration procedure, and how these two numerical routines are connected.
In the following section, four ﬂow problems are considered to validate the current numerical scheme. For each problem,
an unstructured FEM primary mesh is created by the commercial software–Tecplot Mesh Generator – to provide a spatial
resolution similar to or better than the condition of the cited literature. If e denotes the characteristic length scale of the
FEM mesh, the computation time step, Dt, is assigned to satisfy the numerical stability condition Dt < e2/(2/Re + e) proposed
by Baker and Kim [17] and Red and Utnes [18]. Both the mesh information and the adopted time step will be indicated in
each case.
3. Numerical examples and comparisons
Four two-dimensional laminar ﬂow problems with ﬁxed or moving internal solid boundary are considered in this section
to validate the developed simulation tool in two aspects. The ﬁrst two problems involve with only stationary solid boundary
so that the numerical results fully reﬂect the accuracy of the current Navier–Stokes equations solver. This validation is pre-
requisite for the following two tests on the capability of the mesh regeneration algorithm and the performance of the inte-
grated numerical scheme for handling ﬂow problems with signiﬁcant boundary displacements.
3.1. Flow over a backward-facing step
The ﬁrst problem simulates the steady ﬂow over a backward-facing step, which problem has been a benchmark test case
to evaluate the accuracy of a Navier–Stokes equations solver. The ﬂow domain geometry and the boundary conditions are
depicted in Fig. 8. A steady parabolic ﬂow enters the entrance channel of height h and length Le from the left and expands
at the step into a downstream channel of doubled height. The ﬂow exits the channel at a distance L = 50h downstream from
the step. The problem is characterized by a ﬂow Reynolds number Re = umaxh/m = 500, using the maximum inﬂow velocity.
Such ﬂow conditions are chosen in accordance with that considered in the serial FEM computations by Glowinski et al. [19],
Segal [20], Grigoriev and Dargush [21]. An unstructured FEMmesh with 24,760 elements and 12,382 nodes was employed to
provide a spatial resolution similar to or better than those achieved in the cited literature. The available mesh information is
summarized in Table 1. The characteristic length scale of the current FEM mesh is e8  103 which limits the permissible

geometry. Kim and Moin’s work is also referred and the listed value was extrapolated here from their work (Fig. 10 in [10]).
The current results agree well to the most recent data by Grigoriev and Dargush [21] who utilized a poly-region boundary
element method. The magnitude of the circulation zone also conforms to other literature data.
Further, Fig. 10 compares the depth proﬁle of the streamwise velocity from the current work to that reported in [21] at
various streamwise distances from the step: at x = 0.8, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0 and 12.0. General agreement is found within and around
the primary circulation zone, for x up to 4.0, but slight deviation is observed at other downstream locations. The difference,
however, never exceeds 0.27% of umax and thus is evaluated to be negligible. Tables 2 and 3 compare the maximum and the
minimum streamwise velocities at various x and the present results fall among the literature data throughout the ﬂow, val-
idating the current solver. The slight deviation among the various works is speculated to result from the different numerical
schemes and grids employed and the inevitable differences in the computing power.
3.2. Uniform ﬂow past a ﬁxed circular cylinder
Next, we test the classic problem of a uniform ﬂow of velocity u0 over a perfectly rigid circular cylinder of diameter D as
depicted in Fig. 11 where the domain length and width are normalized into L⁄ = L/D and H⁄ = H/D. The boundary conditions
are speciﬁed in the ﬁgure and two ﬂow Reynolds number, Re = Du0/m = 100 and 200, are considered according to the litera-
ture setups [22–27]. The respective domain and cylinder locations, ðx0; y0Þ, are: for Re = 100, (L⁄,H⁄) = (45,14) and
ðx0; y0Þ ¼ ð5;7Þ; for Re = 200, (L⁄,H⁄) = (36,16) and ðx0; y0Þ ¼ ð8;8Þ. The FEM mesh employed for each problem is described
in the caption of Fig. 11 along with the corresponding permissible time increment. Similar to the previous case, the FEM
mesh was prepared to provide matching or better spatial resolution to the cited FEM literature as those listed in Table 4.

3.3. Vortex-induced vibration of a circular cylinder – the VIV problem
In the following two subsections, ﬂow problems that involve with a moving solid cylinder of diameter D are studied. The
ﬁrst example investigates the transverse oscillation of a circular cylinder mounted elastically in a uniform ﬂow of velocity u0.
Such a ﬂow–structure interaction is of particular interest in civil engineering research and has been investigated by means of
both experiments (Anagnostopoulos and Bearman [27]; Roshko [28]) and simulations (Zhou et al. [26]; Nomura [29]; Wei
et al. [30]). In response to the vortices shed at the rear of the cylinder, the elastic cylinder is often observed to vibrate at
a frequency, fc, that is often smaller than the cylinder natural frequency, fn. This later quantity characterizes only the struc-
ture mechanics but reﬂects no ﬂow–structure coupling phenomenon. Due to the ﬂow–cylinder interaction, the vortex shed-
ding frequency, fv, may also differ from the ﬂow Strouhal frequency, fs, measured behind a ﬁxed cylinder under identical
incident ﬂow conditions.
The cylinder response to the hydrodynamic force is typically idealized as the motion of a rigid circular cylinder of equiv-
alent mass ms that is supported in ﬂow transverse direction by an elastic string and a parallel linear dashpot. The schematic
sketch of this problem is provided in Fig. 13 and the ﬂow boundary conditions are speciﬁed following Anagnostopoulos and
Bearman [27] and Wei et al. [30] to approximate the experimental conditions. Let Y(t) denote the cylinder transverse dis-
placement, its time variation can be described [26] as
d2YðtÞ
dt2
þ 21xn dYðtÞdt þx
2
nYðtÞ ¼
FðtÞ
ms
; ð14Þ
where 1 and xn = 2pfn represent the internal damping constant and the angular natural frequency of the cylinder and F(t) is
the total computed ﬂuid force. Eq. (14) can be non-dimensionalized using D and u0 into:
d2Y
dt2
þ 21gSt dY

dt
þ gStð Þ2Y ¼ CðtÞ
2p2c
; ð15Þ
where Y⁄(t⁄) = Y(t)/D with a different time normalization, t⁄ = 2ptu0/D, St = fsD/u0 (for ﬁxed cylinder), g = fn/fs, and
CðtÞ ¼ 2FðtÞ=qDu20 is the non-dimensional drag. Note that the inﬂuence of the cylinder mass on the system dynamics is
embedded into the dependence of Y⁄(t) on the solid-to-liquid density ratio, c = qs/q.

Fig. 15(b) and the literature data, from both experiments and simulations, are also included. The good agreement proves the
capability of the mesh regeneration scheme in handling boundary with oscillating displacement.
Finally, we would like to report that the steadily oscillating frequency of a CL0 ðtÞ proﬁle for a ﬁxed cylinder, fs, was also
estimated to compute the system Strouhal number St = fsD/u0. For all the examined Re, the determined St agrees well with
the prediction from Roshko’s celebrated empirical formula, St = 0.212(1–21.2/Re), further validating the current Navier–
Stokes equations solver.
3.4. Transient drag forces on a moving and a ﬁxed cylinder
The last test case examines the transient drag developed on a circular cylinder of unit diameter D = 1 in different but com-
plementary interactions with its surrounding ﬂuid. The ﬁrst case considers a uniform ﬂow of velocity u0 impinging on a ﬁxed
cylinder; in the other problem, the same cylinder is impulsively set into step motion at u0 in a quiescent ﬂuid. This latter
problem was specially chosen to test the proposed mesh regeneration algorithm in handling a constantly increasing bound-
ary displacement.
This dual problem has been computed by Russell and Wang [31] where the Navier–Stokes equations are treated in the
streamfunction–vorticity formulation on a regular Cartesian-grid (640-by-320 nodes). These authors imposed a potential
ﬂow boundary condition at the computation domain that is sketched in Fig. 16 and two Re = u0h/m = 40 and 100 were con-
sidered. For both Re, the CD(t) proﬁles obtained on the ﬁxed and the moving cylinder agree with each other over the obser-
vation period from t = 0 to 32.
In the present simulation, the ﬂow geometry and Re were set identical to that employed by Russell and Wang (abbrevi-
ated by RW hereinafter) but adopting an unstructured mesh with 21,783 nodes, much less their structured nodes. The mesh
has a characteristic length scale of e  3.5  103 which combines with the lower Re = 40 to limit Dt < 2.3  104 and
Dt = 2  104 was used for both ﬂow conditions. An Eulerian coordinate system Oðx; yÞ was deﬁned at the center of the left
ﬂow boundary as shown in Fig. 16. For the ﬁxed-cylinder problem, the ﬂow came from the left boundary and the cylinder is
located at ðx; yÞ ¼ ð16;0Þ and marked by the black solid circle. Further, these authors adopted potential ﬂow boundary con-
ditions at the ﬂow outer domain. Their streamfunction and vorticity expressions are transformed into velocity boundary con-
ditions in a body-ﬁxed polar coordinate as
(1) at top, bottom, and upstream (left) boundaries:
u ¼ u0ð1 a2=r2Þ cos 2h and v ¼ u0ða2=r2Þ sin 2h;
(2) at downstream (right) boundary: @u/@n = 0, @v/@n = 0;
(3) on cylinder: u = 0, v = 0.

set the examination zone identical to CALE that encloses the moving Lagrangian mesh in the ALE method. Thus, all the
deforming elements have been considered upon mesh regeneration and hence only the inﬂuence of threshold Qmesh is
studied.
The box in the test problem is now ﬁlled with incompressible viscous ﬂuid and the ﬂow induced by the cylinder motion is
simulated at a characteristic Reynolds number Re = 100. Three unstructured FEM, each possesses 3673, 6118, and 12,198
mesh nodes, were examined systematically and will be referred to as the coarse, the medium, and the ﬁne mesh hereinafter.
The smallest characteristic length scale, e  2.5  103, of the ﬁne mesh was employed to assign a constant simulation step
Dt = 2.0  104 to meet the aforementioned stability constraint.
For simulations on one particular mesh, three mesh quality thresholds, Qmesh = 0.25, 0.15, and a smaller 0.12, were em-
ployed to initiate the regeneration procedure. Further, simulations with no regeneration were also performed by using
Qmesh =1. Thus, a total of twelve sets of scheme parameters – three mesh resolutions with four Qmesh – were examined.
To qualitatively compare these numerical experiments, the temporal proﬁle of the drag coefﬁcient was monitored and
the simulated ﬂow structure was examined via its vorticity ﬁeld. Note the examination circle for Qmesh may extend outside
of the computation domain for the current box and cylinder sizes. Nonetheless, this does not affect the computation of Qmesh-
with Eq. (12) since only the mesh elements enclosed by the examination circle are considered.
4.2.1. Qmesh = 0.15 and 1
In accordance with the previous computations, the CD(t) proﬁles using Qmesh = 0.15 are ﬁrstly examined in Fig. 23 by the
three solid-symbol lines marked in the order of increasing spatial resolution with , , and N, respectively. To show mesh
independence, another computation on an even ﬁner mesh with 18,625 nodes was performed and the result is shown by
the + line. A converging trend of CDðtÞ to a constant plateau is clearly observed when the mesh resolution is increased, sug-
gesting mesh independence. Further, the mesh resolution has no obvious effect on the CD values up to t ﬃ 0.5 but the sim-
ulation with higher spatial resolution gives a greater CD(t) afterwards. On the same ﬁgure, the results omitting mesh
regeneration (Qmesh =1) are also shown by the open symbols, s, }, and M. The CD(t) proﬁle obtained on the medium mesh
approaches that found on the ﬁne mesh but the data using the lowest spatial resolution seems abnormal in the long term.
When this data set is compared to that computed with mesh regeneration, agreeing CD values are found only at early times
but discrepancies appear later regardless of the mesh resolution.
When only 3673 nodes are employed, the computation without re-meshing gives a smaller CD than the value with mesh
regeneration after t ﬃ 1.755. The difference between the  and the s curves grows in time and the trend without mesh up-
dates seems abnormal when t? 3.0. With a ﬁner mesh, the CD(t) without mesh regeneration exceeds that using a threshold
of Qmesh = 0.15 at a much earlier time, t < 1.092. It is also observed that the ﬁner the mesh is, the sooner the data deviation
occurs. For each mesh, the speciﬁc time when the no-remeshing CD deviates from the value with mesh regeneration is
marked and snapshots of the instantaneous mesh structure are exported in Fig. 24. The meshes that have been regenerated
are shown in the left column and those without remeshing are presented on the right, showing severe element distortion.
Such a degraded mesh structure can result in erroneous ﬂow velocity, leading to an unphysical CD. The deviation between
each pair of CD slowly diminishes in time at a degree that seems degraded with increasing mesh resolution since mesh dis-
tortion is lessened when a boundary displacement is relaxed onto a greater number of elements. Nonetheless, the trend
shown by the open symbol never conforms to that of the solid symbols.
Since there is no literature works that we can compare our results with to ensure that simulations with mesh regener-
ation do provide more physical predictions, we turned to examine the vorticity ﬁeld of the simulated ﬂow. The results ob-
tained at t = 2.0 and 3.0 on the coarse mesh with and without the regeneration procedure are presented in the left and the
right columns of Fig. 25. It can be seen clearly that the current numerical scheme predicts a pair of primary tail vortices that

4.2.2. Other Qmesh = 0.12 and 0.25
In Fig. 27, several CD(t) proﬁles that employed two other thresholds, Qmesh = 0.12 and 0.25, and the three mesh resolution
are compared with the data using the default Qmesh = 0.15 and the ﬁne mesh (12,198 nodes). The data employing the coarse
mesh consistently fall below the rest results, regardless of the threshold Qmesh, which may be attributed the failure of cap-
turing the secondary vortices on such a coarse mesh as the cases shown in Fig. 25. With increasing mesh resolution, the CD(t)
proﬁle asymptotes to the data using the ﬁne mesh, on which the choice of Qmesh = 0.12 or 0.15 has negligible inﬂuence on the
computed CD values. Among these two data sets, the one using Qmesh = 0.15 converges to the limiting trend obtained on the
super-ﬁne mesh with 18,625 nodes (the + line) on Fig. 23. It is thus concluded that simulations with Qmesh below 0.15 is pre-
ferred when using a mesh at this spatial resolution. Since a lower Qmesh implies a severer condition for permissible mesh dis-
tortion, the mesh regeneration procedure would take place at a higher frequency, leading to noticeable computation
slowdown. Thus, the intermediate value Qmesh = 0.15 was chosen to run the examples in this paper at comparable spatial
resolution.
Further, a closer look at the plateau CD(t) proﬁles, it is interesting to note that a slightly higher CD is predicted when a
larger Qmesh = 0.15 is employed, as compared to 0.12, in contrast with the CD–Qmesh correlation found from the coarse-mesh
simulations. This is because the secondary vortices can be successfully generated on the ﬁne mesh but the structure is more
severely degraded when a larger threshold Qmesh is employed. Unphysical distribution of ﬂow velocity gradient ﬁeld can oc-
cur to give abnormal spiky structure resulting in higher CD as phenomenon found in the no-remeshing cases in Fig. 26.
4.3. Comments
This set of examination focuses on the scheme performance on calculating CD(t) for its crucial role in the equation of mo-
tion of freely moving immersed objects. Note that the computation of CD employs only the mesh structure near the cylinder
surface. Thus, the current selection of threshold Qmesh may not work when the ﬂuid motion further away from the moving
boundary is concerned. Further, since the current investigation considers only the case with Re = 100, a different threshold

As for the method we employed to choose a feasible threshold Qmesh to initiate mesh regeneration, we only examined the
deviation angle of the boundary elements since their shapes are important in computing surface stress. Again, if ﬂow struc-
ture away from the cylinder is simulated, the Lagrangian elements in the concerned ﬂow area should be considered. Simi-
larly, for multiple-body problems, the boundary elements adjacent to each object surface should all be included in the
preliminary parameter study. Finally, a test problem should be prepared according to the ﬂow and geometry condition of
the interested problem. The relative motion between the solid surfaces in the test problem should exceed or at least equate
to that could happen in the real applications. A smaller ﬂow domain may be preferred since it helps to enhance the degree of
mesh distortion and it also saves computation costs.
5. Conclusions
A novel mesh regeneration algorithm has been proposed to recreate an unstructured body-ﬁtted FEM mesh during a ﬂow
simulation with a moving cylinder. The new body-ﬁtted mesh is constructed by stretching a primary mesh that is laid across
the whole computation domain to meet the instantaneous circumference. A set of Laplace equations have been developed to
determine the global radial stretch and angle adjustment of each primary mesh node. These two displacement equations are
required to meet speciﬁc boundary conditions subjected to the cylinder and the other boundary motions. This algorithm has
been implemented into an ALE scheme that solves the Navier–Stokes equations with an operator-splitting technique. The
mesh regeneration efﬁciency is guaranteed by the powerful Laplace equation solver (Bi-CGSTAB) and its effectiveness relies
on feasibly selected examination zone and threshold mesh quality number. This particular quantity is developed in this work
to measure the local mesh distortion in an averaged sense and employed to execute mesh regeneration in a consistent man-
ner during a ﬂow simulation.
The developed numerical tool has been tested on four two-dimensional laminar ﬂow problems. Two cases that involve
with ﬁxed boundary were prepared to validate the Navier–Stokes equations solver. Another two with continuous object mo-
tion were simulated to validate the mesh regeneration algorithm and to evaluate the overall performance of the integrated
numerical scheme. The obtained results were found to agree well with the existing literature data and characteristic ﬂow
dynamics were successfully reproduced. In addition, we also demonstrated some ﬂow features that were not seen in the lit-
erature, at least to the best of our knowledge. First, in the VIV problem, we have utilized FFT analysis to demonstrate how the
cylinder vibration lags, resonates, and advances the ﬂow responses as the system transits forth and back between the beating
and the lock-in states upon Re increment. As a by-product, the current simulation also reports the whole evolution history of
CD(t) developed on a ﬁxed cylinder immersed in a starting ﬂow, which reveals a later augmentation after a seemingly steady
state developed at early times. The slight deviation observed in the transient CD(t) proﬁles among the existing literature
undoubtedly motivates further research.
Further, an independent test problem and the corresponding analysis are introduced to illustrate how a feasible thresh-
old, Qmesh = 0.15, was selected this work. The number of bad boundary elements is examined with respect to Qmesh at two
mesh spatial resolution and the results suggest what Qmesh can effectively control the number of bad elements around the
object. The same test problem is also employed to examine the scheme performance in calculating the time-varying drag
coefﬁcient with respect to the threshold mesh quality number in the regeneration algorithm. This second examination val-
idates the selection of threshold Qmesh = 0.15 for mesh regeneration. Nonetheless, further research is required to clarify the
interplay between the scheme performance and all its parameters. A few targeted problems include: how the algorithm efﬁ-
ciency and effectiveness change with respect to the sizes of the examination zone for Qmesh and the annulus for identifying eC.
It is also important to know how the learning may change with respect to the mesh spatial resolution and the object contour.
It is also desired to generalize the current mesh regeneration algorithm to accommodate multiple moving or rotating objects
and objects of complex contour.

is found that the configuration and the velocity of the tail vortices change due to the 
fixed cylinder, which in turns generates a hydrodynamic force affecting the approach 
of the moving cylinder.

simulation using a liquid-modified contact model (in particulate flow 
session, by F.-L. Yang, W.T. Chang, C.S. Chen, S.H. Hsieh, Y.T. Huang) 
This work extends a conventional Discrete-Element method to simulate the avalanche 
process and the subsequent bulk motion of a wet granular mixture, composed of 
identical solid spheres fully-immersed in a viscous liquid. A linear soft-sphere contact 
model is developed for interactions between dry surfaces to reproduce both the 
Hertzian contact time and the overall energy loss, characterized a measured 
coefficient of restitution. The contact model is modified for liquid dissipation effects 
according to previous experimental data. To assign parameters for tangential 
interactions, this works uses the measured bulk dynamic behavior, differing from 
most existing schemes. The simulated mixture motions are compared to experimental 
data, conducted on a lab-scale flume, at both flow and particle scales. General 
agreement is obtained on the whole granular avalanche process and the early stages of 
the subsequent downstream bulk motion. The validated simulation results are further 
employed to extrapolate bulk dynamics difficult to measure in the experiments, 
including 3D profiles of bulk velocity, strain, and granular temperature. The obtained 
results will be adopted to stress how liquid modifies the unsteady behavior of a 
granular mixture.

Abstract 
 
This paper describes an image analysis routine to investigate solid-liquid granular flows in a thin rotating drum. New findings 
of liquid effects on modifying the granulate dynamics are reported. The major contribution of this work, nonetheless, is to 
propose a flow classification criterion for liquid-included granular flows by comparing the bulk surface velocity, Us, with 
respect to the drum speed, ω. This criterion is based on a model proposed earlier by Tegez et. al (2003) exclusively for the 
motion of wetted granular mixtures that employed only particles with damp surfaces. Experimental results for submerged, 
immersed, wetted, and dry bulks are integrated together to generate a Us-ω phase plot on which a granular, a transition, or a 
viscoplastic bulk flow can be effectively categorized.  
 
Introduction 
 
The dynamics of dry granular matter has formed an active 
research field for more than two decades for its prevalence 
in both natural and industrial processes. Unlike typical 
single-phase materials, a granulate assembly can exhibit 
fluid-like and solid-like behaviors simultaneously under 
external loading, possessing a transition zone within the 
bulk. This peculiar behavior has attracted many researchers’ 
attention with the hope to develop a feasible dynamic model. 
Nonetheless, the dual-nature of the mixture properties posts 
great challenge on theoretical analysis and lab-scale 
experiments have become a popular research means to 
investigate the mixture dynamics. A rotating drum has been 
a popular facility to generate continuous surface flow and 
the resulting dry bulk dynamics is commonly categorized, 
by the flow Froude number Fr =R2ω/g—with R, ω, and g 
denoting the drum radius, angular velocity, and gravity (Jain, 
Ottino, & Lueptow 2004), into avalanching, rolling or 
cascading, cataracting, and centrifuging regimes. Here, we 
chose the drum speeds (below 6rpm) to ensure a rolling 
phase for the simple flat profile of the bulk free surface. The 
most well-know feature of such surface flow is the linear 
velocity-depth profile remained over a few particle 
diameters near the free surface which transits into an 
exponentially decaying profile with flow depth (Courrech 
du Pont et. al 2005, Forterre and Pouliquen 2008, GDR 
Midi 2004, Jain, Ottino, and Lueptow 2004, Orpe and 
Khakhar 2007). 
While the dynamics of dry granular mixtures have been 
widely explored, our knowledge of how the presence of 
liquid may affect the collective motion of granulates is 
fragmental and rather limited. There exist a few pioneering 
experimental works that consider two limiting cases of 
solid-plus-liquid mixtures. The first class considers particles 
with damp surfaces and the deviation between any bulk 
dynamics from that exhibited by a dry bulk is examined by 
considering the cohesion force developed in the interstitial 
liquid films. This type of mixtures will be referred to as a 
wet bulk in this work. Tegzes, Vicsek, and Schiffer (2003) 
measured the surface velocity, Us, of a wet bulk with respect 
to the drum speed, ω, and categorized the bulk into a typical 
granular flow or a viscoplastic flow according to the Us-ω correlation. For a granular flow, they found Us = Aω2/3, 
which confirms the theoretical prediction by Arrason and 
Tsimring (2002); in the viscoplastic regime, Us = Bω was observed. These authors also measured the bulk velocity 
along the drum centerline and a plug flow with concave 
velocity depth profile was discovered near the free surface. 
Brewster, Grest, and Levine (2009) reproduced the surface 
plug flow in the discrete-element simulation by introducing 
a cohesion force in to the conventional contact model. They 
explained that the plug was formed since the weight of the 
overlying material could not overcome the finite yield stress 
induced by the interstitial liquid cohesion. Thus, a bigger 
plug was produced when the cohesion strength was 
increased.  
The second class of study fully fills the drum space with 
excessive liquid creating a pure solid-liquid two-phase flow, 
which will be termed as a submerged bulk. Jain, Ottino, and 
Lueptow (2004) measured the bulk velocity depth profile at 
the midstream and found a slower bulk motion than the dry 
case at the same  . The measured velocity depth profiles, 
however, were dynamically similar to each other after 
scaled by Us  and the flowing layer thickness, δ, which led 
the authors to conclude that the bulk dynamics is not 
strongly altered by the coexisting liquid. However, if we 
examined the reported Us with respect to  , it is very interesting to discover that all the investigated flows obey 
the condition that Us > Aω2/3. This particular finding led us 
to speculate let us speculate whether the categorization 
proposed by Tegzes et. al for wetted bulks—namely the Us 
= Aω2/3 or Bω correlation—also works for other types of

spheres can be filtered out by choosing an appropriate 
intensity threshold, estimated by the image histogram. A 
check routine was still applied to fully remove the 
second-layer locators. We first calculated the distance 
between each Pi (xit) and its three most adjacent neighbor 
locators, Ni1 (xi1t) ~ Ni3(xi3t), as dik= | xit - xikt | with k=1~3. 
If the mean of di1, di2, and di3 falls below 0.9D, Pi (xi, yi) was 
eliminated. To initiate this final check routine, a sphere had 
to be manually selected from the first-layered spheres. The 
obtained sphere locators were imposed onto the original 
image and the result is shown in Fig. 2(c).  
 
      
 
Figure 2: Image processing routine: (a) the raw grayscale 
image (b) the image after the Gaussian and the Laplacian 
fitering (c) the obtained sphere locators. 
 
Particle tracking was achieved by the method of 
the nearest neighbor (Böhm et. al 2006). In Fig. 
3(a), let Pi (xit) denote the position of the locator 
of sphere A1 in the image taken at time t. A search 
circle of radius D was located precisely at Pi (xit) 
on a subsequent image at time t+∆t, as portrayed 
by the large dotted-dashed circle in Fig. 3(b). 
Within this search circle, the sphere locator of 
particle A2 that possessed the shortest distance to 
Pi (xit) at time t+∆t was determined to be the same 
sphere monitored at time t. The instantaneous 
displacement vector, A1A2, was then divided by 
the elapsed time ∆t to calculate the instantaneous 
velocity vector for the sphere A1. This matching 
routine continues until all the spheres are paired 
between two images. The success of such a simple 
tracking algorithm crucially relies on a 
sufficiently small displacement vectors. Such a 
precondition was met by choosing a camera 
shooting frame rate high enough to ensure that no 
sphere travelled more than 1/4D – the length scale 
of the bright spots— between two consecutive 
snapshots. The current 500 fps frame rate was 
determined by trial and error. Of course, the 
sufficient image resolution also facilitated this 
track routine. 
  
Figure 3: (a)-(b) Particle tracking employing the method of 
the nearest neighbor. 
 
To present the bulk motion, an orthogonal coordinate 
system was defined on the nearly flat free surface with the 
positive X-axis pointing downstream and the Y-axis 
pointing away from the mixture (see Fig. 4). Such a 
coordinate system was inclined from the actual horizontal 
by an angle β, whose value varied with the drum speed and 
the mixture composition. Different from the existing works 
in which the reference frame is often manually assigned, a 
statistical approach was developed determine β in a 
consistent manner. A screening window was first selected 
beneath the free surface near the drum center as the dashed 
box in Fig. 4(a). All the sphere displacement vectors that fell 
in this screening box were monitored for 50 consecutive 
frames. The slope of each displacement vector was 
converted to an inclination angles β. The occurrence of each 
angle, N(β), was counted found to peak between 20˚ and 40˚. 
The result obtained for the water-immersed bulks, chosen as 
an example, is shown in Fig. 5(a). The top 30 probable 
angles measured in each bulk motion were averaged to 
estimate β and the coordinate system was rotated 
accordingly.

immersed mixtures can provide normal support to the 
particle assembly that effectively diminished the wall 
friction and thus a greater wall slip.  
According to the bulk velocity depth profiles, these mixture 
motions may be categorized into three distinctive groups: (1) 
a faster group possessing linear sections near Y=0 (the dry 
and the water-submerged mixtures:  and ), (2) a slower 
class showing blunt profiles across the medium with nearly 
zero surface gradient near the surface (the two 
glycerol-immersed and the glycerol-wetted mixtures:,, 
and ▲), and (3) the rest profiles they possessed concave 
profiles near the surface (the water-wetted and the 
water-immersed mixtures:  and ). It is thus speculated 
that if the two Us-ω correlations proposed to classify wetted 
bulk flows has any relation to these three types of velocity 
profiles. In other words, it is of particular interest to 
examine if the type-1 bulk motion obeys Us > Aω2/3, which 
suggests a granular type bulk motion despite the presence 
of interstitial liquid. Similarly, it is interesting to examine if 
a type-2 mixture possesses a surface velocity that Us < Bω 
and flows like a viscoplastic liquid medium. Type-3 
mixtures motion will then be termed as in the transition 
phase that possessed a a concave section near the free 
surface—suggesting a more liquid-like motion only near the 
bulk surface. 
The same solid-liquid mixtures were driven to their steady 
states using a wider range of drum speeds, from ω= 0.69 to 
6.04 rpm. For each mixture, the measured surface velocity, 
after spatial and temporal average, are plotted as a function 
of drum speed in Fig. 7. The coefficients A=20.785 and 
B=33.588 for the two Us-ω correlations were fitted from the 
experimental data in Tegez et. al. To better illustrate the 
flow classifications, the transition and the viscoplastic 
regimes were shaded by light and dark gray, respectively.  
 
Figure 7: Surface velocity versus drum speeds. The 
interfaces that separate the transition from the granular and 
the viscoplastic regimes are given in (A) and (B). 
 
It is very interesting to find that the three types of bulk 
velocity profiles fall nicely into the three zones separated by 
the two Us-ω correlations. To be more specific, the dry and 
the water-submerged mixtures ( and ) that fall in the 
granular regime exhibited a linear velocity profile near the 
surface, composing type-1 flows. The two immersed 
mixtures ( and ) and the glycerol-wetted bulk (▲) 
flowed like a liquid medium in the viscoplastic regime as 
the type-2 motion. Lastly, the water-wetted mixture () that 
flowed in the transition phase but closer to the granular 
regime show more granular flow characteristics. Only very 
near the surface were revealed the liquid cohesion effects 
that helped the aggregation of a thin plug flow. However, 
when the water-immersed bulk () moved in the close 
vicinity to the viscoplastic regime, as indicated by the white 
up-arrow, showed more liquid-like behaviors, including the 
blunt profile across the flowing layer and a diminished 
surface strain rate.  
This close agreement in the two flow classifications 
motivated us to reexamine the velocity depth profile in the 
flowing layer of each mixture. The flow depth and the bulk 
velocity are normalized as Y*=(Y-d)/d, using the flowing 
layer thickness, and U* = U/Us or U/Umax for the cases that 
possessed a concave profile with its maximum occurring 
beneath the free surface. The result for ω=3.96 rpm is 
shown in Fig. 8 with the categorization regimes shaded 
accordingly. Type-1 and Type-2 bulk motions are clearly 
separated by the two limiting transition flows. 
 
 
Figure 8: Normalized bulk velocity profiles with flow 
classification (ω=3.94 rpm). 
 
Further, it is observed that the water-submerged mixture 
converted from the granular into the transition regime at 
when driven at a lower ω = 1.36 rpm (see the left black 
arrow in Fig. 7). Its normalized U*(Y*) profile is thus 
compared to the other mixture motions in Fig. 9(a). As 
shown in Fig. 7, both the water-submerged () and the 
water-immersed bulks moved in the transition phase at this 
low drum velocity. The submerged bulk that just converted 
from the granular regime exhibited a Type-1 flow motion. 
The liquid-like behaviour observed in the surface motion of 
a water-immersed mixture (), the other bulk in transition 
phase, actually fell closer to the viscoplastic zone on the 
Us-ω phase plot in Fig. 7. 
A last examination was performed for the cases with ω= 6 
rpm where the resulting bulk motions were well-separated 
on the Us-ω phase plot. Consistent results to the previous 
cases can be easily drawn: both granular flow-like (Type-1) 
and the liquid flow-like (Type-2) behaviours were found for 
bulks that fell in the granular and in the viscoplasitic

The influence distance between hydrodynamically coupled solid surfaces
F.-L. Yang, Y.Y. Zheng, and C.A. Yeh
Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan
Background & Objective
When two solid objects exhibit unsteady relative motion in an incompressible and viscous liquid, the
momentum and kinetic energy possessed by the particles may be transmitted or dissipated by the ambient
liquid. This hydrodynamic coupling has been reported by Joseph (2001) as the sudden deceleration of an
immersed pendulum when it approaches a solid wall (Fig.1a). Similarly, in a dual-pendulum experiment, Yang
and Hunt (2006) observed pre-collision target motion induced by the incoming particle motion (Fig.1b). To
better understand this dynamic process, this work experimentally investigates how a second stationary solid
object affects the motion of an immersed particle through liquid coupling.
Facilities, Methodology & Materials
The newly introduced influence distance was examined as a function of particle Stokes number in Fig.6a, 
which is defined, measuring the ratio of particle inertia and liquid viscous force, as
where 
where =S/F and the characteristic velocity was chosen to be the value at =3D, denoted by UP,3D. From 
previous experiences, hydrodynamic coupling with an interstitial distance above 3D is negligible.

approach and one typical results are shown in Fig.4 a and b. For each impact condition, five experiments
were conducted to ensure repeatability, which data were averaged (after 5-point smoothing in time) and
compared to the free motion of a free pendulum as a function of interstitial gap, .
Fig. 4. The (a) position-
time and (b) velocity-
position profiles measured 
for a glass pendulum 
released from an angle 22°
in a liquid ( ). All the five 
sets were shown. 
Fig.5 .  Identification of 
the influence distance on 
the plot of pendulum 
velocity scaled by that 
measured at the same 
location for a free swing. 
To qualitatively evaluate such non-contact coupling, the pendulum motion at a specific  , UP,was scaled by
the local velocity of a freely moving pendulum, UFree, adopting the same flow conditions. The result is shown
in Fig5 and pre-collision deceleration was observed at a gap that seemed to increase with the target size and
liquid viscosity and density. The distance at which UP/UFree dropped below 0.95 was interpolated from the
experimental data for all the examined pendulum motion, as shown by those vertical lines. This particular
length scale was employed to characterize the influence distance of interest.

Future Work
Two complementary sets of experiments have been conducted with the hope to scrutinize the underlying
mechanism that characterize the dynamic coupling observed in this work. One project focuses on in-situ
measurements of unsteady hydrodynamic forces using strain-gage based transducers. The other project
performs PIV measurements (particle-image-velocimetry) of the induced flow field. The preliminary results
from each project are introduced below.

A water tank facility has been developed (Fig.2a, b) in which a solid sphere of diameter D and density P can
be released as a pendulum in a controlled manner in a viscous fluid of viscosity μ. This impact sphere was
allowed to move perpendicularly towards a downstream sphere of various diameters or a target wall (Fig.2c).
Special care was made to ensure that the line sphere centers coincided with the swing plane of the impact
pendulum motion (Fig.2d).
Fig.3 Image processing at one particular time: (a)-(b) the acquired RGB images were converted to 8-bit
grayscale format; (c)-(d) after contrast and brightness corrections, a threshold grayness was chosen to
convert the image to binary (BW)version; the locations of all the black pixels were averaged to represent the
particle centroid. Note that the background and the target can be easily removed by subtracting the first and
the final images.
The process was recorded by a high-speed digital camera (200~800 frames per second) and the acquired
images can be processed to obtain the impact pendulum motion in time (see Fig.3 For details). To simplify
image processing routine, the system was illuminated from behind (Fig.2c, Fig.3).
Two materials were chosen, steel and glass with corresponding densities S=7.8 and 2.54 g/cm
3, the impact
pendulum, each made for two sizes of 15 and 20 mm in diameter, D. The pendulum release angle ranged
from 13° to 22°. Seven target sizes were specified, scaled by D, as 0 (no target), 0.5, 1,2,4,5,12.5, and  (flat
wall). The colliding pair can be envisioned in Fig.2 with the corresponding size ratio specified. Two water-
glycerol mixtures were employed, with respective density and viscosity of F = 1.214 and 1.244 g/cm
3 and μ=
62 and 138 cP (27 °C) . Thus, four solid-to-fluid density ratios: =S/F = 6.32 and 6.47 (steel pendulum); 2.06
and 2.11 (glass pendulum).

It is obvious that stronger hydrodynamic coupling is developed when the pendulum approaches at smaller St,
which may by attributed directly to a lower particle inertia as compared to the viscous force. Further, the
longer-range coupling can also result from a faster-propagated flow disturbances in the relatively low Re
flow condition. Similarly, increases in the target size have the same augmenting influence on the influence
distance. In Fig xx(b), the results obtained for the glass and the steel pendulum were plotted separately,
revealing similar trends but with a off-set. This observation may indicate the significance of solid-to-fluid
density in characterizing the unsteady hydrodynamic coupling between two immersed objects.

many years in the scientific community. However, little research is known 
regarding the microscopic origin. This study investigates the impact of a projectile 
onto a bed of 3 mm grains immersed in an index-matched fluid. It was found that 
the non-affine motion within the system as a function of projectile shape and 
initial sample preparation. The preliminary results show significant non-affine 
motion near the impactor. 
(4) Bridging the rheology of dense granular flows in three regimes: DEM simulations 
of simple shear flow of dense assemblies of soft, frictional particles have been 
carried out over a range of shear rates and volume fractions in order to 
characterize the rheology of granular flows in three regimes: quasi-static regime, 
inertia regime and transition regime. In previous study, the pressure in each 
regime is found to obey an asymptotic power law relation with shear rate. This 
study constructs a blended pressure model and constitutes the shear stress ratio in 
terms of two dimensionless groups: the inertia number I which governs the 
rheology of hard particles, and the ratio of shear time to the particle binary 
collision time, which characterizes the departure from hard-sphere behavior. 
 
We presented three talks this year with the submitted abstracts given below. 
 
(i) Lateral wall effects on the immersed pendulum dynamics and its interaction 
with a downstream target (H.S. Chen and F.-L. Yang) 
The unsteady motion of a solid sphere in an incompressible viscous liquid and its 
interaction with solid boundaries has been examined and most existing knowledge 
concerns sphere motion in creeping flow regime or sphere collision dynamics. Much 
less investigated is when the solid sphere exhibits unsteady lateral motion relative to 
one or two planes. Thus, this work studies the dynamics of a fully immersed spherical 
pendulum when it moves midways between two lateral walls via systematic 
experiments. By changing the release angle and the liquid viscosity, a wide range of 
maximal particle Reynolds number, Re
*
 from 3 to 295, were achieved without the 
presence of lateral walls. The same release was repeated with lateral walls imposed at  
various gaps, with a gap-to-diameter ratios W/D =1.2~5.0, and the resulting max Re* 
were measured. We also estimated the coupling distance, Xc, when a downstream 
target sphere was set into motion by the impact sphere. If head-on collision was 
observed, the ratio of the relative sphere velocities after and before the collision were 
used to calculate the coefficient of restitution, e. The measured Re
*
, Xc, and e will be 
presented as a function of W/D along with some preliminary analysis. 
 
that as long as the basal slip is taken into account, the failure plane can be 
successfully captured in the dry and the water-immersed avalanches.

參加國際會議 (1) 62nd APS DFD, Nov. 22-24, 2009  
Some of our related works were presented at the 62nd annula meeting of the 
American Physical Scoiety’s Division of Fluid Dynamics (APS DFD) in Minneapolis, 
Minnesota from Nov. 22—24, 2009. The meeting was hosted by the University of 
Minnesota at the Minneapolis Convention Center in downtown Minneapolis with an 
objective to promote the advancement and dissemination of knowledge in all areas of 
fluid dynamics. The technical program features oral presentations, posters and videos 
of fluid flow, and eight mini-symposia on diverse topics: (1) Cavitation inception and 
bubble dynamics in vortical Flows by S. Ceccio, Univ. of Michigan, (2) Bio-mimetic 
flow control by H. Choi, Seoul National Univ., (3) Unsteadiness of shock wave / 
boundary layer interactions by N. Clemens, Univ. of Texas, Austin, (4) Particle 
entrainment under turbulent flow conditions by P. Diplas, Virginia Tech, (5) Fluid 
mechanics inside a volcano, by M. Manga, UC Berkeley, (6) Ocean surface waves 
and turbulence: air-sea fluxes and climate variability, W. Kendall Melville, UC San 
Diego, (7) Tumor blood vessel dynamics, L. Munn, Harvard Univ., and (8) Patterns 
and dynamics in transitional shear flows, L. Tuckermann, CNRS, France. 
Apart from these, 16 parallel sessions of around different topics were running 
spontaneously and two of our related works were presented with each abstract 
submitted to the conference program attached below. 
(i) Interaction of multiple solid objects and vortices in a two-dimensional 
potential flow (in Potential Flow session, by J.T. Wu, F.-L. Yang, and D.L. 
Young) 
The generalized Lagally theorem states that the unsteady hydrodynamic force acting 
on a rigid body exhibiting arbitrary motion in an inviscid and incompressible fluid can 
be expressed explicitly in terms of singularities such as sources and dipoles which 
generate the flow field. This work extends the theorem by considering the presence of 
point vortices in the flow, which results in additional force components when 
formulating the equation of motion for the solid bodies. The present model has been 
applied to describe the motion of a circular cylinder that interacts with a vortex. The 
obtained result is in exact agreement with the result derived by other researchers 
considering the conservation of the sum of the solid momentum and the fluid impulse. 
The current model is further applied to study a moving cylinder towards a fixed one, 
while the former motion is coupled with two tail vortices with designated strength and 
initial configurations, which are prescribed by the solution to the Foppl's problem. It

參加國際會議 (2) 7th International Conference of Multiphase Flow (ICMF), 
Tampa, Florida, May. 26-Jun. 04, 2010 
This conference is the premier international conference, held every four years, 
for multiphase flow research, which brings together researchers from different 
disciplines and application fields. ICMF-2010 is the 7
th
 in a series originated in 1991. 
The conference has a week-long program, with three plenary lectures and 16 keynote 
lectures scheduled on every morning and afternoon. Between the lectures, there are 
4-6 parallel sessions of oral presentations and two 2-hr long poster sessions on two 
afternoons. 
Our lab submitted a proceeding paper on two-phase flow rheology entitled 
“Liquid effects on the velocity profile of granular flows in a rotating drum and flow 
categorization,” which was presented at one of the oral sections. We also presented a 
poster “ The influence distance between hydrodynamically coupled solid surfaces,” at 
the poster session. Both works received several interesting questions and nice 
feedbacks and the presented slides, conference paper, and poster are provided at the 
end of this appendix.

solid-liquid granular flows.  
The main purpose of this work is to answer this speculation 
with systematic experiments. To extend the flow conditions, 
we prepared a third type of solid-liquid mixtures where the 
particles are fully immersed in the liquid but the drum space 
is left unfilled. An interface is thus created which boundary 
condition may modify the bulk motion leading to new bulk 
dynamics. In addition to bulk surface velocity, we also 
examine the depth profiles of bulk velocity and the shear 
strain rate with respect to the flow classification. The 
flowing thickness, δ, is also monitored which quantity is 
typically defined at the interface that separates the moving 
assembly from the rest stationary bulk. To achieve this, an 
image analysis has been developed to monitor individual 
particle motion using PTV (particle-tracking velocimetry). 
The individual particle motion is then averaged to estimate 
the bulk motion, as a continuum, by an area-weighted mean.

Experimental Facility and Flow Condition 
 
As sketched I Figure 1, a thin rotating drum of an inner 
radius R=17.5 cm and width W=6 cm has been constructed 
with plexiglass. The drum was half-filled with granular 
mixtures composed of mono-disperse POM spheres 
(diameter D=4.76 mm and density ρp =1.4 g/cm3) of 
identical total weight, with or without the interstitial liquid. 
The drum was driven at a range of angular velocities, from 
ω = 0.69 to 6rpm, chosen carefully to ensure that a nearly 
flat surface was formed at steady states. For the dry bulk, 
the flow Froude number falls in the range of Fr=3x10-4 to 
8.26x 10-3 , entirely in the rolling regime. Three Newtonian 
liquids, water and two water-glycerol mixtures, were used 
and their density and viscosity are ρf =0.997, 1.232, and 
1.314 g/cm3 and μf =0.893, 150, and 200 cP, respectively, at 
room temperature (~25˚C). The resulting mixture is 
described as wetted, immersed, or submerged according to 
the amount of liquids. The liquid type will also be specified, 
giving descriptions like ‘water-wetted’ or ‘150 cP 
glycerol-submerged’.    
The bulk motion was monitored from the drum lateral side 
by a high-speed digital camera at 500 frames per second 
(fps). This shooting rate was chosen to meet the particle 
displacement condition required in our PTV algorithm. The 
whole flow domain was monitored at a resolution of 
1280-by-1024 pixels, after rotating the camera frame in line 
with the free surface, and each sphere spanned at least 17 
pixels in the images. Since the drum width was filled by 
only 11 to 12 spheres, the resulting bulk motion was 
assumed to be nearly two dimensional. The motion of the 
spheres lied adjacent to the drum lateral wall should suffice 
to represent the bulk motion across the drum width and thus 
should effectively reveal the liquid effects on the bulk 
motion.

Fig. 2 (a) shows a portion of a grayscale raw image captured 
in the experiments. The bright spots formed on the POM 
surface due to the light source were employed to locate the 
individual spheres. The light source induced high-frequency 
noises were first filtered by a Gaussian filter. A Laplacian 
filter was then applied to enhance the image contrast, 
transforming bright spots into separate white patches in Fig. 
2(b). The characteristic length scale of these patches was 
estimated to be around 1/4D. Within each patch, a search 
routine was performed to locate every pixel that possessed 
an intensity value above a threshold. The locations of these 
identified pixels were averaged to obtain a mean position, Pi 
(xit) , xit = (xit, yit), as a sphere locater at time t.

value was estimated  =20.4±1.56˚; (b) Illustration of area 
weighting schme for the calculation of UB(x,y).. 
 
 
To describe the bulk as a continuum, a spatial average was 
performed using an averaging square B with a side length of 
2D. This averaging box was staggered over the bulk with a 
constant shift D in the X- and Y-directions, as that depicted 
in the bottom of Fig. 4. The box geometric center, B(x,y) , 
generates a grid of uniform spacing D across the bulk. At a 
specific time k, the bulk velocity vector at a location (x,y) 
was calculated by the motions of the N spheres that fell 
entirely or partially in B(x,y) as 
 1 1( , ) N NB jk j jj j ku x y a u a     
where ju and ja denote the instantaneous velocity vector 
of each sphere and its partial area that overlaps with B(x,y) 
as those shaded in Fig. 4. The resulting bulk velocity 
distribution has a spatial resolution as high as 1D, which 
suffices to capture any sharp variation in the bulk dynamics. 
After a time sequence of uB(x,y)k was computed, a temporal 
average was performed to estimate the bulk quasi-steady 
profile, UB(x,y), by averaging four sets of ten consecutive 
data, with a constant 0.2 second time span between each set. 
Note that the calculations of UB(x,y) employ the sphere 
projection area, instead of its actual volume, to present the 
sphere occupation. Thus, these formulas may overestimate 
the actual three-dimensional values. However, considering 
the quasi-2D nature of the bulk flow, the obtained results 
should suffice to characterize the bulk behaviors. 
To emphasize variations with the flow depth, a 
secondary spatial average along the X-axis was 
performed to smooth out streamwise data 
fluctuations at the particle size level. A probing 
stripe of width 8D was located at xs=0 and the 
bulk velocity at a specific flow depth iy  was 
calculated by the arithmetic mean of UB(x,y) with 
xs-4D < x < xs+4D. The obtained bulk properties 
are denoted by U(Y) without the subscript B and 
the 1D spatial resolution is preserved along the 
flow depth. 
 
Results and Discussion 
Fig.6 shows the depth profiles of U(Y/R) measured along 
the drum centre line in each bulk motion driven at ω= 3.94 
rpm. As portrayed by the open-circle-solid line (), the dry 
bulk exhibited a linear velocity-depth profile near Y*=0 
which is a well-known phenomenon for a collision-rich dry 
surface flow. A surface velocity of about 35 cm/s was 
measured which surpassed the surface motions of all the rest 
liquid-included mixtures. The deduction of surface velocity, 
Us, may be attributed to viscous dissipation in the interstitial 
liquid films when surface spheres collided during their 
downstream motion. It is interesting to find that the second 
fast surface motion was developed in the water-submerged 
mixture that showed analogous U(Y/R) profile—almost 
linear—near the free surface, plotted by the open-square () 
line. Only slight deviation was observed as YØ0 as shown 
by the open-square-solid line. Other liquid-included 
mixtures exhibited much slower surface motions and 
distinct depth profiles. For example, as shown by the 
open-triangle-solid line (), the water-wetted mixture 
exhibited a concave velocity profile suggesting the 
formation of a very thin plug flow. When these spheres were 
fully immersed in the liquid, the buoyancy force helped 
mobilize the particle assembly, leading to a thicker layer of 
spheres in downstream motion. The liquid may even 
accumulate sufficient inertia to interfere with the sphere 
motion, resulting in dramatic changes of U(Y*) to more 
blunt profiles at smaller magnitudes as shown by the 
open-diamond (), the solid-circle (), and the solid-square 
() lines. It is very interesting to observe a diminishing 
depth gradient, ∑U/∑Y, near the free surface suggesting a 
liquid-like behavior. This liquid-like bulk behavior was also 
observed on the glycerol-wetted mixture motion, depicted 
by the solid-triangle line (▲), possibly due to the stronggh 
cohesion forceDeviations in the bulk streamwise velocity 
depth profiles serve as preliminary evidences of liquid 
dissipation of particle kinetic energy and its modification of 
bulk momentum transport mechanism. While dissipation 
increases with mf , interstitial fluid of greater rf can provide 
larger buoyancy mobilizing the bulk and enhancing the 
liquid momentum.  
 
 
Figure 6: Velocity depth profiles in the drum centre (see the 
shaded zone) using various mixtures and ω= 3.94 rpm.  
All the investigated mixtures went through non-linear 
deceleration as going deeper into the bulk. Each profile 
eventually merged onto a linear segment of negative U(Y*) 
which moved with the drum motion as an incompressible 
continuum medium in solid body rotation. The dry, the 
water-wetted, water-immersed, water-submerged, and the 
150cP glycerol-wetted mixtures seemed to collapse onto a 
universal profile. However, the lower bulks of the two 
glycerol-immersed mixtures exhibited distinctive off-sets 
from that universal linear profile, suggesting the formation 
of a lubrication liquid layer near the drum wall. This may be 
confirmed when the bulk wall velocity, Uwall, was compared 
to the drum circumferential velocity, Udrum=Rw=7.33 cm/s. 
Only these two glycerol-immersed mixtures possessed Uwall 
below Udrum but at a degree increasing with mf and rf . Both

phase, dual nature behaviours were observed. However, 
tendency towards a granular or a viscoplastic flow-like 
motion can be clearly predicted by its flow condition on the 
phase plot.

Conclusions 
 
In this work, a rotating drum facility and image analysis 
methods are introduced to examine the steady motion of 
liquid-included granular motions in a thin rotating drum. Via 
systematic experiments, we confirmed the speculation raised 
here of whether or not the Us –ω classification rule, namely 
Us > 20.785ω2/3  for a granular flow and Us < 33.588ω for a 
viscoplastic flow, that proposed exclusively for wetted 
granular flow can also capture the nature of other 
liquid-included mixture motions. The behaviour of a 
solid-liquid two-phase flow can now be predicted, 
qualitatively, by the knowledge of the drum velocity and the 
bulk surface velocity. This latter quantity is always much 
easier to measure than the bulk velocity depth profile and 
thus this finding is of great importance in many multiphase 
flow applications.

Shear strain rate (1/s)
• Finite strain was observed at the surface of granular type flow (solid-like)
• Nearly zero strain was measured at visco-plastic types (fluid-like)
Summary
• Methodology:
– Systematic experiments on dry and liquid-inclusive granular flows        
in a thin rotation drum
– Image analysis routine to track particle motion (Hough        
transformation & PTV)
– Average scheme to estimate bulk motion (achieve high spatial 
resolution)
• Flow classification on a phase plot of surface velocity vs. drum 
speed for various types of liquid-inclusive granular flows
• Liquid effects of bulk dynamics:
– mobilize particle (thicker flowing regime); dissipates system k.e 
(slower bulk motion); generate slip at drum wall
• Rheology near free surface: 
– Granular type flow: linear velocity depth profile; finite shear strain
– Viscoplastic type flow: over-quadratic velocity depth profile; 
nearly-zero shear strain
參加國際會議 (3) 64th APS DFD, Baltimore, Nov. 19-23, 2011. 
As a tradition, eight invited talks were given at this conference but the content 
diversity seems somewhat lost to me with more attention switched to bio-related, 
small-scaled, or interfaial phenomenons. I attened six of them but found this year’s 
talks were too practical and thus not as inspiring as the past talks that features 
fundamental fluid physics. This year’s talks are: (1) Foams, surface phenomenon, 
saltation, I. Cantat, (2) Whale tubercles and implications, F. Fish, (3) fluid mechanics 
and public policy, from natural disasters to climate change, J. Hunt, (4) super- 
hydropobic surface, N. Patankar, (5) experimental manipulation of wall-bounded 
flows, B. McKeon, (6) DNS and multiscale modeling of multiphase flows, G. 
Tryggvason (7) Capillary phenomenon at nanoscales: electrowetting and capillary 
adhesion, M. Robbins, and (8) Breakup of liquid massess, mixing, E. Villermaus. In 
particular, Tryggvason’s talk on multiphase flow should be the one best matches our 
research interest but it is somewhat disappointing that the speaker did convey much 
new physics from his extensive investigations.  
Apart from the invited talks, I learned some new aspects on granular materials at 
a few talks as: 
(1) Flowing layer thickness in a granular tumbler: The thickness of the flowing layer 
in tumbler varies substantially depending on flow conditions, but no predictive 
approach is available. For dry granular flows, the flowing layer thickness 
measured in units of particle diameter scales with a dimensionless flow rate based 
on the tumbler rotational speed and radius as well as the particle diameter. Using 
appropriate characteristic time scales, the data for the dry and liquid experiments 
also collapse fairly well. 
(2) Segregation of binary mixtures, competing effects of gravity and shear rate 
gradients: Mixtures of particles tend to segregate when they flow. For example, 
when a dense binary mixture of different-sized particles flows down an inclined 
plane, the larger particles tend to go up toward the free surface and the small 
particles goes down, which phenomena is attributed to Brazil nuts effect. It has 
recently been demonstrated that the relative segregation in a binary mixtures are 
not monotonically dependent on particle size ratio. Further, for a single mixture, 
larger particles may rise or fall relative to the same particles depending on subtle 
differences in local flow conditions. The study shows that a shear rate gradient 
drives segregation in dense flows, and that the direction depends on the 
partitioning of stress between species. The complicated segregation dynamics in 
gravity-driven flow may be due to competing effects of gravity and shear rate 
gradients in segregating particles. 
(3) Impact dynamics in a 3D granular bed: Granular impacts have been studied for 
(ii) In-situ shear stress indicator using heated strain gages at the flow boundary 
(by C.A. Yeh and F.-L. Yang Yang) 
This work borrows the concept of hot-wire anemometry and sketch a technique 
that uses local heat transfer to infer the flow field and the corresponding stress. 
Conventional strain gages were mounted at the flow solid boundary as the heat source 
and acrylic boundary was chosen for its low thermal conductivity ensuring heat 
accumulation when a gage is energized. The gage would now work in slightly 
overheated state and its self-heating leads to an additional thermal strain. When 
exposed to a flow field, heat is brought away by local forced convection, resulting in 
deviations in gage signal from that developed in quiescent liquid. We have developed 
a facility to achieve synchronous gage measurements at different locations on a solid 
boundary. Three steady flow motions were considered: circular Couette flow, 
rectilinear uniform flow, and rectilinear oscillating flow. Preliminary tests show the 
gage reading does respond to the imposed flow through thermal effects and greater 
deviation was measured in flows of higher shear strain rates. The correlation between 
the gage signals and the imposed flow field is further examined by theoretical analysis. 
We also introduced a second solid boundary to the vicinity of the gage in the two 
rectilinear flows. The gage readings demonstrate rises in its magnitudes indicating 
wall amplification effect on the local shear strain, agreeing to the drag augmentation 
by a second solid boundary reported in many multiphase flow literatures.  
 
(iii) Avalanche dynamics of dry or fully immersed granular mass and temporal 
evolution of failure structure (Y.T. Huang and F.-L. Yang) 
This work examines the avalanche process of dry and fully immersed granular 
mass abruptly released down a laboratory flume (of width 15 cm) of smooth bed at 
fixed inclination experimentally. The granular mass is composed of identical glass 
spheres (of diameter 1.6 cm) and Newtonian fluids (water or 200 cP glycerol). 
High-speed imaging technique was applied to capture individual sphere motion from 
the flume lateral side. The obtained sphere collective motion show distinctive patters 
in relation with the failure plane which developed during an avalanche. We also 
estimate instantaneous bulk velocity distribution by area-averaging of individual 
sphere velocities. It is observed that the interstitial liquid can enhance bulk basal slip 
due to lubricating effect. The liquid viscosity also gives rise to a unifying effect on 
bulk dynamics: sharp interface between moving and stationary spheres can be 
detected in dry mass but not for the liquid-immersed mass. Lastly, we apply the 
Coulomb failure criterion developed in soil mechanics for homogeneous infinite static 
mass to predict the failure plane in current finite mass in unsteady motion. It is found

• Conventional strain gauge has been implemented on substrates 
with unmatched β.  
• Gauge signal variation with respect to imposed external flow has 
been studied: 
• Δε ~ external flow strength 
Remarks: 
• Repeatability suggests a promising application; however, signal is 
observed to be sensitive to plate geometry and material, as well 
as installation orientation (natural convection may come into play.) 
• Scaling analysis has been performed to rule out other 
mechanisms that may induce strain on the gauge (ex: substrate 
deformation, temperature effect of GF, flow viscous heating.) 
• On-going theoretical analysis to correlate the gauge reading to 
imparted shear stress.

本期計畫為期三年四個月，旨在探討兩完全沉浸固體顆粒的相對運動如合透過周圍流體在
非接觸的狀態下相互影響，觀察沉浸單擺球在黏性液體中的運動，比較第二近場固體邊界
如何改變其原有運動，實驗發現第二邊界的存在—無論是正向或側向—造成單擺運動額外
的減速，更特別訂義額外減速發生時的固體表面間距為耦合距離δ，以系統性之實驗探究
此耦合距離如何隨顆粒雷諾數(particle Reynolds number, Re)及史托克數(particle 
Stokes number, St)改變，發現沉浸單擺運動與第二正向及側向邊界之耦合距離δ均隨 Re
及 St 之減少單調遞增。 
同時，為解釋所觀測到的單擺顆粒額外減速及δ-Re 與δ-St 之實驗關係，本研究案同步
針對流固耦合效應下的流體阻力進行兩項獨立但相輔相成之的理論研究。其一針對無黏性
理想流理論 Lagally Theorem 做推廣，在理論中包含流場自由渦度(free vortex)，可以
利用表示流場及顆粒運動之奇異點(Singularity)性質—強度及位置—以代數式表示某固
體邊界所受之流體體總力，此結果對多顆粒之流固耦合問題提供了有力的理論研究工具。
另一理論則整合有邊界修正之理想流及傳統邊界層理論，建立一個理論架構探討在第二正
向邊界如何影響非穩定的黏滯力—Basset history force(對描述非穩態沉浸顆粒運動相
當重要) —之動態發展，並對傳統’無限流域’假設下之理論結果提出邊界修正。 
更進一步的，為解釋實驗觀測之顆粒運動行為及驗證理論模型，本計畫整合現有之壓力計
及荷重元，達成同步壓力及流體總力之量測。此外，亦獨力開發以應變規為主的量測模組，
以期得到同步的剪力量測。此兩方向研究費時較久，在第三年起始完成實驗設施之搭設及
