devices can be classified into two categories: outdoor 
and indoor. Although the global positioning system 
(GPS) is the most popular outdoor positioning device, it 
cannot be used in an indoor environment. Many indoor 
positioning technologies have already been proposed 
which rely on various kinds of technologies such as the 
RFID, ultra wideband, wireless LAN, or even 
Bluetooth1-4. 
Many researchers have focused their attention on 
location-related topics. For example, S. Banerjee et al. 
proposed a location-aware system architecture called 
Rover5 which is designed to scale up to large user 
populations. When a user moves from the service 
domain of one Rover to another, the user’s profile -- 
preference, device capability, etc. -- can be transmitted 
to the target Rover. Thus, the target Rover can provide 
the service without interruption.  
Some researchers have focused on location 
management. For instance, S. C. Lo et al. proposed a 
method to solve the performance problem of location 
management for personal communication services 
(PCSs)6. In Lo’s proposed method, a user’s movement 
behavior is associated with a set of regions. The 
registration process in the same region can be 
eliminated so that the cost of location management can 
be significantly reduced. D. L. Lee et al. clarified many 
things related to the location-dependent information 
service (LDIS)7 and include issues such as 
location-dependent data placement, replication, 
indexing, caching, broadcasting, query scheduling, etc. 
In addition, M. Bauer et al. focused on the location 
model and derived the requirements for a general 
location modeling language for ubiquitous computing 
called Augmented World Modeling Language (AWML) 
and Augmented World Querying Language (AWQL)8.  
Many researchers have also studied how to 
identify the location of a user by basing it on the user’s 
movement behavior, the cell ID in a GSM cellular 
network, or the signal strength in a wireless network9-11. 
S. Harri et al. focused on the location-dependent query. 
An example of a location-dependent query would be, 
“Please list taxis within five miles.” Since the query 
results have to be updated continuously, an agent 
technology is used to improve the updating efficiency12. 
S. Prabhakar et al. proposed another solution to 
overcome the same problem13. 
The popularity of mobile devices has caused more 
and more location-related services (LBSs) to be utilized 
on these types of devices. One of the basic services is to 
monitor the locations of moving objects. The locations 
should be updated continuously while the update 
interval should also be short enough to reflect the 
real-time locations of the moving objects. However, 
when the number of objects and the monitoring area are 
both large, the monitoring service encounters the 
constraints of screen size, computing speed, and 
network bandwidth. According to our estimates, the 
time it takes for displaying ten thousand locations on a 
Pocket PC is about 14.3 seconds. This means that the 
update interval must be larger than 14.3 seconds. This 
makes it impractical to provide a monitoring service on 
mobile devices. 
In order to overcome the above-mentioned 
constraints, a two-phase SRM (scale-based reduction 
method) is proposed. It consists of a zoom phase and a 
mosaic phase. The purpose of the zoom phase is to 
reduce the original monitoring area which, in turn, is 
reduced to a small area based on a first scale called the 
area scale (AS). The purpose of the mosaic phase is to 
reduce the display quality on the screen of mobile 
devices in order to display the data faster. Thus, the 
small area is further reduced based on a second scale 
called the screen scale (SS). 
Scaling is an instinctive way of overcoming the 
screen size constraint. According to the scaling concept, 
the data size can be reduced using the proposed method 
in order to address the network bandwidth constraint. 
The execution of the two-phase SRM is on the server 
side only in order to decrease the computation load on 
mobile clients and allow the monitoring service of a 
large number of moving objects on mobile devices.  
In Section two, the reduction principle of the 
two-phase SRM is presented. The simulation is 
presented in Section three, while the experimental 
metrics and results are presented in Section four. 
Section five summarizes the conclusion and presents 
possible future works. 
 
2. Method 
The scenario of a monitoring service is shown in 
Figure 1. Assume that all of the moving objects such as 
people, cars, etc., are equipped with positioning devices 
and wireless communication capability. The real-time 
locations of these objects are transmitted to and stored 
in a location server. Thus, a mobile client can use a 
device to subscribe to a monitoring service from the 
server. The real-time locations of these moving objects 
are displayed on the mobile device and updated 
continuously.

A two-phase SRM is proposed to resolve the 
constraints discussed earlier. It consists of a zoom phase 
and a mosaic phase. The purpose of the zoom phase is 
to reduce the original monitoring area in order to 
minimize the data size. This phase is also referred to as 
area reduction. On the other hand, the purpose of the 
mosaic phase is to reduce the display quality on the 
screen of the mobile devices in order to display the data 
faster. This phase is also called screen reduction. These 
two phases are illustrated in Figure 2:

Figure 5: A screen shot of the simulation tool 
A demonstration of the zoom phase is shown in 
Figure 6. There are three screen shots for the three 
different area scales under the group distribution. The 
screen scale is assigned with the value of one, which 
means that there is no mosaic effect in the mosaic phase. 
When AS is equal to 0.1 the entire original monitoring 
area is displayed on the screen as shown in Figure 6(a). 
Conversely, the precise locations of the moving objects 
are displayed on the screen when AS is equal to one as 
shown in Figure 6(c).

A demonstration of the mosaic phase is shown in 
Figure 7. The value of 0.1 is assigned to the area scale 
to allow the entire monitoring area to be shown on the 
screen. When SS is equal to one, there is no mosaic 
effect and the result is as shown in Figure 7(a). 
Conversely, the mosaic effect is obvious when SS is 
equal to 0.1 as shown in Figure 7(c).

under random distribution are shown in Figure 8.

As an advanced illustration, the screen shots of the 
simulation tool with the background map and object 
information are shown in Figure 9. In Figure 9(a), the 
tool displays the correct part of the background map 
according to the AS. The tool can also display the 
object’s information, e.g., its label, based on its 
identification. However, many locations can be reduced 
into the same pixel when the AS is small. If the labels 
of the objects in the same pixel are simultaneously 
displayed, the result would be similar to the screen shot 
shown in Figure 9(b) which can be confusing for the 
users. Such a problem can be resolved by displaying 
only parts of the objects that are interesting for the 
users.

From these demonstrations, we can already 
understand the principles behind the two-phase SRM as 
well the operation of the monitoring service on a 
mobile device. 
 
4. Experimental Study 
4.1 Experimental metrics 
There are two ratios which have been defined for 
the performance evaluation of the two-phase SRM. The 
reduction ratio (RRatio) is the percentage of the final 
data size after the reduction by the two-phase SRM in 
relation to the original size. RRatio is influenced by the 
settings of AS and SS. On the other hand, only the data 
of the visible area are transmitted to the mobile devices 
to implement the monitoring service. The transmission 
ratio (TRatio) is defined as the percentage of the data 
size of the visible area when compared to the original 
data size. The computation for the RRatio or the TRatio 
does not include the size of the background maps or the 
information related to the moving objects as shown in 
Figure 9. The reason for this is that these data are fixed 
and transmitted only once and thus, are not anymore 
necessary in the computation of the RRatio and TRatio.  
Besides, the experiment on the bandwidth usage is 
not included in the metrics since it is related to the 
operations of the mobile clients for only a period of 
time. Mobile clients can adjust the settings of AS and 
SS when necessary. Not only is it difficult to simulate 
the behavior of the mobile clients, but it also results 
into a mix-up of various settings of the AS and SS. Thus, 
the performance of the two-phase SRM is not easily

The values of the two parameters N and M were 
based on the screen width and the number of moving 
objects. Since the screen width is 200 pixels, one byte 
is enough for storing the x- or y-coordinates. Two bytes 
were assigned to N. M was also assigned with two bytes 
and this means that there was a maximum of 65,536 
moving objects that could be identified.  
  
4.2.1Experimental results of the zoom phase  
The simulation generated ten sets of separate 
locations. The RRatio and TRatio under different scales 
were computed for each set of locations. In order to 
evaluate the zoom phase, the screen scale (SS) was set 
to one. The results of RRatio in the zoom phase are 
shown in Figure 10.

Figure 10: A comparison of RRatio under random or 
group distribution in the zoom phase  
In Figure 10, the x-axis represents the area scale 
from 0.1 to 1, while the y-axis represents the reduction 
ratio. The four curves represent the RRatio of 1000, 
4000, 7000, and 10000 locations with group and 
random distributions. In general, RRatio increased as 
the area scale increased. The RRatio of the group 
distribution was about ten to fifteen percent lower than 
that of the random distribution. This means that the 
two-phase SRM performed better when the locations 
were concentrated in several hot spots. The four curves 
resulting from the random distribution were almost 
identical. This means that RRatio was not influenced by 
the location size. Conversely, the more locations 
involved, the lower the RRatio under the group 
distribution. The smallest RRatio was 80.6% under a 
scale value of 0.1 and with 10,000 locations. Almost 
one fifth of the location data was reduced by the 
two-phase SRM. 
The results of the TRatio are shown in Figure 11. 
There are three curves representing the average, 
maximum, and minimum TRatios under the random 
and group distributions with 10,000 locations. It was 
obvious that TRatio decreased rapidly as the area scale 
increased. In the case of the random distribution, the 
difference between MinTRatio and MaxTRatio was 
small. For the group distribution, AvgTRatio was close 
to the curve which resulted from the random 
distribution. However, MaxTRatio was about five to 
thirteen percent higher than AvgTRatio. This means that 
even though the locations were concentrated on the hot 
spots, TRatio did not increase that much. The smallest 
values of MaxTRatio, AvgTRatio, and MinTRatio were 
6.2, 1.2, and zero percent, respectively. This illustrates 
that the network bandwidth constraint can be solved 
using the two-phase SRM based on the scale concept.

The influence of the location size on AvgTRatio 
was also tested. The results are shown in Figure 12. 
There is no explicit difference from among the curves 
resulting from random distribution. Conversely, 
AvgTRatio decreased as the location size decreased for 
the group distribution. This is because the decrease in 
location size caused the group distribution to become 
similar to that of the random distribution. Thus, the 
curve resulting from the group distribution with 1,000 
locations overlaps with the curves resulting from the 
random distribution.

Figure 12: A comparison of AvgTRatio with different 
location sizes 
From the above-mentioned results, even though 
the smallest RRatio was 81 percent, AvgTRatio 
decreased rapidly to 1.2 percent as the area scale 
increased. This shows that the two-phase SRM can 
resolve the screen size and network bandwidth 
constraints and is therefore effective for monitoring a 
large number of objects on mobile devices.

4.2.3 Experimental results for server load 
According to the principle of the two-phase SRM, 
the computations are only on the server side. An 
experiment was designed to evaluate the computation 
time of the location server. The computation time was 
evaluated under the maximum load of the server, i.e., 
the whole area is processed by the server. In other 
words, AS and SS are both equal to 0.1. A Pentium IV 
3.0 GHz desktop computer with 512MB of memory 
was used as a location server. Various numbers of 
subscribers, that is, mobile clients, requested the 
monitoring services from the location server. The 
number of subscribers was from 20 to 200, while the 
number of locations was from 5,000 to 50,000. The 
computation was repeated 100 times for every set of 
subscribers and locations in order to get the precise 
computing time.  
The experimental results as listed in Table 4 show 
that the computing time increased as the number of 
subscribers increased. However, the computing time for 
200 subscribers was only 0.31 milliseconds. The 
computing time was almost the same regardless of what 
the number of locations was for the same number of 
subscribers. This shows that the two-phase SRM 
efficiently reduces the number of moving objects.

5. Conclusion and Future Works 
Location-based services (LBSs) are becoming 
more popular as the use of wireless networks and 
mobile devices are getting to be more widespread. 
However, the storage, screen size, network bandwidth, 
and computing speed constraints are causing many of 
these services to require special designs in order to 
address these problems. In the present paper, a 
two-phase SRM was proposed to solve the problems of 
monitoring a large number of moving objects on mobile 
devices. The experimental results show that the 
two-phase SRM not only overcame the screen size, 
computing speed, and network bandwidth constraints, 
but also efficiently shortens the display time of the 
locations. These results show that the two-phase SRM 
is practical and efficient when applied to the monitoring 
service on mobile devices. 
There are still other issues which need to be 
addressed in the future. One example of such issues is 
the incorporation of the two-phase SRM and the cache 
technique. The cache is a useful technique for lessening 
unnecessary network traffic. Thus, such incorporation 
can already decrease the network traffic beforehand. 
Another issue concerns the situation whereby a large 
number of mobile clients are subscribing to the 
monitoring service for different sets of moving objects. 
The two-phase SRM will have to be refined in order to 
overcome all the possible problems that may arise.
