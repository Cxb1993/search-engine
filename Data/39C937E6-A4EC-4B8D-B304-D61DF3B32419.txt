Abstract 
A direct-conversion receiver architecture becomes a trend in industry and academic world nowadays 
because it is small, cheap and less power-consuming. This kind of architecture, however, accompanies with 
some radio frequency (RF) imperfections such as the direct current (DC) offset, frequency offset, 
in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) mismatch, and etc. In this work, it focuses on the topic of the RF impairment of I/Q 
mismatch and CFO. 
 To achieve satisfactory performance in analog I/Q processing based wireless receivers, the matching of 
amplitudes and phases of the I and Q branches becomes vital, and also consider the CFO effect. In this thesis, 
a novel baseband I/Q mismatch estimation and compensate technique is proposed to overcome I/Q mismatch 
with large CFO in MIMO-OFDM systems. Moreover, depend on [11] to combine the P-CFO method and the 
proposed I/Q-M scheme. To make these algorithms can work under large CFO and I/Q-M, proposed a flow 
and the improved phase recovery scheme to improve the whole system performance. The proposed schemes 
be able to estimate and compensate the non-ideal effect up to gain error 2dB, phase error 20 degree, and CFO 
150ppm in MIMO-OFDM systems.  
 
Another, smart antenna and digital beamforming in MIMO-OFDM system are an efficient way to improve the 
performance. Two of them are cancelling the interference signal and emphasize the interested signal. They can 
be used the antenna array to received signals and control the direction of the maximum gain via different 
phase adjustment.  
We proposed a method to estimate the arrival of angle in smart antenna system. The method detects 
correlation of transmitted signal by search the maximal quality form transmitted-end. Moreover, according to 
this method, we can find an arrival angle on received-end and adjust the antenna angle to steering them. It can 
improve the interested signal quality. In digital beamforming system, if the signal arrival on received-end is 
skew, it will cause the signal performance terribly. We proposed a method to detect the channel environment 
to adjust the signal on received end. The received signal is computed a weighting vector to improve the SINR 
(Signal Interference Noise Ratio), increase capacity and enhance the signal quality.  
Through simulation in IEEE 802.11n platform with TGn channel D, It will show that the proposed algorithm

一、簡介   
In [1], a pseudo-CFO method has proposed to estimate CFO value and it can tolerate small estimation 
error with I/Q-M.  Now, we want to make it to estimate large CFO with I/Q-M. In fact, it can estimate CFO 
value to close the ideal value without I/Q-M under CFO 100ppm and 150ppm. However, when we consider 
the effects of large CFO and I/Q-M, the estimation error will be serious. So if the I/Q-M effect is small, it can 
estimate CFO value correctly by the second time estimation. Of course, the I/Q-M estimator can tolerate the 
residue CFO and it will be able to estimate the correctness I/Q parameters. Finally, how to estimate and 
compensate for the residue CFO and phase error are also important by using OFDM pilots. In [2], though the 
phase recovery has been proposed, the convergence is slow when residue CFO is large. We want to solve and 
improve these problems. The need for high transmission rate and guaranteed quality of service has grown 
rapidly in wireless communication system. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is one of the 
multi-carrier modulation schemes. It has been considered one of the major techniques for next generation 
wireless communication. A receiver of OFDM system can avoid intersymbol interference if the guard interval 
(GI) is larger than the channel delay profile. The OFDM has been adopted in digital audio broadcasting and 
digital video broadcasting-terrestrial (DVB-T), it already forms the basis of the current wireless local area 
network (WLAN) standard, IEEE 802.11 a, g and n. 
Currently, Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) system, where antenna arrays are equipped at both 
the transmitter and receiver with a signal processor, antenna arrays has been considered not only improved the 
high-bit-rate transmission and increased the performance of system over multipath fading channel, but also for 
interference suppression. Therefore, the combination of MIMO and OFDM is seen as an attractive solution for 
high speed indoor WLANs in frequency selective fading channel environment. 
Multiple antenna techniques are considered as the promising technique for the high spectral efficiency. The 
space division multiple access (SDMA) is one of technique multiple antenna technique, it increases total 
system capacity and the signal quality by digital beamforming and null interference operations.

thing is increasing capacity for incorporating DBF into future wireless communications system. 
 
Fig.2.2 A generic digital beamforming system 
A generic DBF antenna system shown in Fig.2.2 It consists of three components: the antenna array, the 
digital receivers, and the digital signal processing. 
Digital beamforming is based on the RF signal and each antenna elements into two binary baseband 
signals representing cosine and sine wave. These two digital baseband signals can be used to find amplitudes 
and phase of the signals at each received antenna. The process of beamforming is use a weighting to change 
digital signals, like adjusting their amplitude and phase, such that we adding together to form the desired 
output. The key to this technology is the accurate translation of the analogy signal into the digital region. An 
optimum antenna is one that carries out the conversion of the signals that arrive at its face without introducing 
any distortions to the signal. It is for this reason that a digital beamforming antenna might be considered to be 
an optimum antenna.  
Fig.2.3 depicts a simple structure that can be used for beamforming. The process represented in Fig.2.3(a) 
is referred to as element-space beamfroming, where the data signals from the array elements are directly 
multiplied by a set of weights to form the desired beam. Rather than directly weighting the outputs from the 
array elements, they can be first processed by a multiple-beam beamformer to form a suite of orthogonal 
beams. The output of each beam can then be weighted and the result combined to produce a desired output. 
This process is often referred to as the beam-space beamforming in Fig.2.3 (b). 
In this paper, the contribution is use the cross-correlation and auto-correlation value to detect the arrival 
of angle and adjust antenna to steering them in smart antenna system. In digital beamforming system, we

the I/Q-M parameters are calculated by TD-IQME algorithm, feedbacks to update the I/Q-M parameters, and 
the new I/Q-M parameters are used to compensate for next symbol in TD. After that, we use next three L-STF 
to do the second CFO estimation. In the same way, we update the CFO value and make the next symbols to be 
compensated by the second estimated CFO value. After the second CFO estimated, we use L-LTF to do the 
third estimation for CFO. The CFO value is accumulated with previous CFO at this time. The following 
received symbols are compensated by the final accumulated CFO value. Next, we focus the residue CFO 
estimation and compensation for data symbols. In next section, we propose an estimation scheme for I/Q-M 
scheme which can tolerance the first CFO estimation error, and make the second CFO value to be more 
correct.

Since the sample time ( sT ) is 50 ns and the remaining CFO ( σΔ ) is maximum 30ppm(under 150ppm CFO, 
2dB gain error, 20degree phase error), sNTσπΔ2 is small and approximated 1. 
( sNTσπΔ2 = 6 92 30 10 16 50 10π − −⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ). Accordingly, the following equation holds: 
2 1sj NTe π σΔ ≅                                                 (3-8)

Figure 3-2 is the flow chart of phase recovery. After FFT, the numbers of FD data symbol add one. When 
the symbol number is a multiple of four, there is two ways. One way is that the pilots are extracted to estimate 
the phase error for each data symbol. And then we can estimate the average residue CFO value between the 
nth symbol and the n+4th symbol. Finally, the average CFO value is accumulated and feedback to 
compensate for the next received symbols in time domain. The other way is that the data symbol is 
compensated by the accumulated phase error, first. The phase error is accumulated from the nth symbol and 
the n+4th symbol. And then the pilots are extracted to trace the phase error for each data symbol again. After 
that, the data symbol will be compensated by the phase error in frequency domain. Once the phase error is 
acquired in the step of phase error estimation, it will be used to compensate for the received data and be 
accumulated for following incoming data symbol. Finally, the compensated data will be sent into the STBC

signal. Basically, if the correlation value is large, it will have large possible to say the signals come from these 
short preambles which the transmitted end sends. 
For example, when receiver 1 received the signals, the signals are combine the transmitter’s signals 
including transmitter1, transmitter2...etc. All of these will let the signal cannot recognize quickly and clearly. 
The directional antenna to direct the signal of interest and it can be getting the higher gain of the signals. 
When the receiver end gets the higher gain of interest signal, it will have large signal powers and qualities. 
Use correlation values to quantize these situations which can estimate the signal come from. That is, the 
maximal correlation value, which can rotate the antenna beam to this arrival of angle. Then by pass the signal 
to next stage. 
There are some of steps of detection algorithm, which can be discussed in next section.

3.5 Detection algorithm 
The proposed algorithm has four steps to detect the arrival-of-angle, 
1. Antenna scan form -90° to 90° 
2. Use auto-correlation and cross-correlation to quantize the strength of signals. 
3. By correlation value, use algorithm to calculate the angle of interest signal. 
4. Update and rotate the antenna angle to receive signal.

spectrum of higher power can find some possible cases in this power angular spectrum. In the other word, 
when getting a power angular spectrum, it’s well to know where the angle of power is larger and where the 
angle of power is small. Defined a ratio φ as a angle estimation threshold. After a lot of simulation results, 
we can statistic the performance that if set φ is 0.5, it will find the arrival of angle accurately. After setting 
the threshold, there exist some remain power of spectrum. Group remain of the spectrum, it can be find the

In Fig 3.7, setting the threshold and in Fig 3.8 (a) is after setting the threshold. It is a new power angular 
spectrum after the set threshold and filtering the low possible in front method. There are some cases in power 
angular spectrum to find the arrival of angle. It will show as follows on Fig 3.8 (a) ~ (e) and table I.  
The possible areas represent the more possible of arrival angle. It should to selecting the arrival of angle 
form possible area. On this paper, choose the max angle of the possible area and delete the neighborhood of 
max angle. Repeat this action, until to find the number of signal. Following table I will introduce the detail of 
choosing algorithm. 
 25
5 Possible regions>4 
Possible region is large four such that it means every 
arrival of angle will not closely. Choosing the four 
maximal of possible areas to be the arrival of angles. 
Step4: Update and rotate the antenna angle  
 
Fig.3.9 Update and rotate the antenna angle 
 
After determine the arrival of angle, rotate the receiver antenna to steering the arrival of angle. This 
action will make the receiver end have higher quality of signal then untargeted angle. 
Fig3.10 is a figure about MSE of angle. Obviously, it can see that if did not adjust the antenna of angle, it 
will have large errors of angle. The average angle of MSE is 60 degrees inaccuracy. If rotate the receiver 
antenna, used to steer the arrival of angle, it can be have the less errors of angle and received the large 
strength of signal power. It will be improve the system performance on this algorithm.

Implement the channel impulse response detector to detect the channel arrival. Detector detects the 
channel arrival at the same time or not, when detect the channel is skew, use a switcher to switch the mode 
that to adjust the channel. It will be better 2.67 dB then not adjust the channel. All of these things will 
implement in hardware design.

2. IEEE 802.11-10/0245r1 
z Abstract 
– The proposal presented in this new technique presentation deals with the 
problem of device discovery using directional antennas in 60 GHz band. The 
presentation outlines the existing techniques, presents a new approach and 
provides a comparison. 
z Conclusion 
– Device discovery using directional antenna can be performed efficiently with 
a nominal overhead by using two beacons i.e. discovery beacon & periodic 
beacon 
– By solving the spatial discovery problem, the location of the device is known; 
this can assist in solving other issues e.g. deafness and hidden node problem 
 
3. IEEE 802.11-10/440 
z Proposal overview 
– Supports data transmission rates up to 7 Gbps  
– Supplements and extends the 802.11 MAC and is backward compatible with 
the IEEE 802.11 standard  
– Enables both the low power and the high performance devices, guaranteeing 
interoperability and communication at gigabit rates  
– Supports beamforming, enabling robust communication at distances beyond 
10 meters  
– Supports GCMP security and advanced power management 
– Supports coexistence with other 60GHz systems 
– Supports fast session transfer among 2.4GHz, 5GHz and 60GHz 
z Conclusions 
– Part of complete proposal in 802.11-10/432r2 (slides) and 802.11-10/433r2 
(spec) 
– Up to 7Gbps 
– Optimized for NLOS – tolerant to high degree of multipath 
– Significant commonality with counterpart SC MCS’s

9 Lower complexity. 
z Dual-Mode PHY would be the best solution for TGad: 
– SC mainly targeted on low power applications with lower achievable 
throughput.OFDM mainly targeted on high throughput applications. 
– SC and OFDM rates are defined in different MCSs in the same MCS table 
(starting from MCS1). 
z A low rate common mode is necessary for any device to build up the 
beamformed links before transmitting regular higher rate SC/OFDM MCSs

2. 4C activated where no carriers are configured with MIMO: Working 
assumption for SF128; evaluation shall only consider existing proposals 
already made at RAN1#60bis. 
3. Companies are requested to consider their positions with respect to the 
following 4 alternatives: 
(Revisit on Friday) 
Alt 1:  
- SF128 for all cases of 3C or 4C configured;  
- SF256 for all cases of <3 C configured 
Alt 2:  
- SF128 for at least the following cases: 
o 3/4C activated with MIMO configured on 1 or more activated carriers 
- SF256 for cases with less than 3 carriers activated 
- Other activation/deactivation cases FFS 
Alt 3:  
- SF128 for at least the following cases: 
o 3/4C activated with MIMO configured on 1 or more activated carriers 
- SF256 for cases with less than 3 carriers activated 
- Other activation/deactivation cases FFS 
- Activations / deactivations that would require a change of SF constrained 
to radio frame boundaries. 
Alt 4:  
- Use SF128 for all cases with coding and bit interleaving such that when 
pairs of HS-DPCCH bits are the same the transmitted chips are the same 
as SF256 
 
Minimum CQI reporting period: 
From RAN1#60: 4ms for all cases of 4C 
 
3C w/o MIMO:  
Consider further between 2 ms, 4ms and “cross-combined” CQI until RAN1#61. 
3C with MIMO: 4ms 
 
Agreement: 
RAN WG1 assumes that the 1st, 2nd and 3rd secondary serving HS-DSCH cells will be 
indicated to the physical layer by higher layers. If two uplink frequencies are 
configured, the 1st secondary serving HS-DSCH cell is paired with the secondary
