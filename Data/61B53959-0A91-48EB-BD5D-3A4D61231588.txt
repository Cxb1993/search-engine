Abstract 
   In this work, we successfully developed a 
process to fabricate dual-channel polymeric 
waveguide filters based on an  asymmetric 
Bragg coupler (ABC) using holographic 
interference techniques, soft lithography, and 
micro molding. At the cross- and self-reflection 
Bragg wavelengths, the transmission dips of 
approximately –16.5 and –11.7dB relative to the 
3dB background insertion loss and the 3dB 
transmission bandwidths of approximately 0.6 
and 0.5nm were obtained from an ABC-based 
filter. The transmission spectrum overlaps when 
the effective index difference between two 
single waveguides is less than 0.0025.

二、緣由與目的 
 Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) 
has proven to be a key technology for 
accommodating large bandwidths for the global 
spread of multimedia communications in optical 
fiber networks. In WDM-based networks, 
optical add/drop multiplexer (OADM) devices 
used to insert (add) or extract (drop) a specific 
wavelength in optical fiber communication 
systems are essential. These components allow 
the extraction of a wavelength from a 
transmission loop and the addition of the same 
wavelength to the network (T. Erdogan 1998). 
Numerous different architectures of add/drop 
filters based on optical waveguides have been 
demonstrated. These include Mach-Zehnder 
interferometer (MZI) based add/drop filters (D. 
Gauden et al. 2004), grating-assisted 
co-directional couplers (M. Kulishov et al. 
2004), asymmetric Bragg coupler (ABC) based 
filters (T. Erdogan 1998), and Bragg reflector 
channel waveguide filters (M. Dainese et al. 
2006). ABC-based filters, which operate in a 
contra-directional mode, are not sensitive to 
grating placement for obtaining a desired filter 
spectrum. Therefore, they have better stability 
and reproducible mass production than 
MZI-based filters.  
We recently demonstrated a process to 
rapidly produce submicron range gratings on a 
waveguide for optical filters using soft 
lithography, micro-molding, and holographic 
interference techniques. In this method, the 
grating structure on a polymer is first fabricated 
using holographic interferometry and the 
micro-molding processes. Polymeric 
wavelength filters are produced by a two-step 
molding process where the master mold is first 
formed on a negative tone photoresist and 
subsequently transferred to a PDMS mold; 
following this step, the PDMS silicon rubber 
mold is used as a stamp to transfer the pattern 
of the polymeric wavelength filters onto a UV 
 3
range of 300-400nm. After the polymer was 
completely cured, it was easily peeled off from 
the mold. The SEM images show that the 
replication on epoxy was good (Figs. 4 (a) and 
(b)), and matched the negative photoresist mold 
dimension well. The optical microscope (OM) 
images show the end faces of the cross-section 
of the  ABC filters (Figs. 4 (b)). After 
separation from the PDMS mold, a hardened 
epoxy with gratings formed the cladding layer of 
the polymer waveguide filter. For Sample 1, the 
dimensions of waveguide grooves are 13.8 µm × 
7 µm and 13.8 µm × 7 µm, the length is 5 cm, 
and the gap is approximately 3.5µm. 
To form the waveguide core, at first，we use 
the material of a first kind (su-8 2005) to 
spin-Coating on the mold of an asymmetric 
Bragg couplers of OG146, then we put on a 
heated plane for the substrate to 
ensure that the light guiding material fill the 
waveguide. Next, we use the same pattern mask 
with the left waveguide to align the waveguide 
of the left side, then it was cured by exposure to 
UV light. After exposure to UV light, we carry 
on soft bake and the develop, as shown in Fig. 
1(i)、(j) and (k).  
Repeat the steps, we use the material of 
a second kind (su-8 3005) to spin-Coating on 
the mold of an asymmetric Bragg couplers of 
OG146.The negative photoresist (SU-8 3005) is 
coated by two stage. it was coated with a 7.0 µm 
thick negative photoresist (SU-8 3005), then we 
put on a heated plane for the substrate. Next, we 
use the same pattern mask with the right 
waveguide to align the waveguide of the right 
side, then it was cured by exposure to UV light. 
After exposure to UV light, we carry on soft 
bake and the develop, as shown in Fig. 1(l) and 
(m).  
To prevent optical loss due to either surface 
scattering losses or the outright absence of a 
guided mode for the asymmetric waveguide 
structure, the upper cladding layer was used. 
The same UV epoxy (OG146) was deposited 
using the fabricating procedure described in the 
previous section (Figs. 1(n)-(p)). A spacer with 
a thickness of 410µm was placed between the 
sample and a thin Pyrex glass slide. After 
injecting the precured UV polymer (OG146) 
into the opening between the mold and the glass 
slide, UV light was used to crosslink the 
polymer. The sample was diced and the endfaces 
were polished; the final polymeric ABC filter 
was 4cm in length, 1cm in width and 
approximately 810µm in thickness (Fig. 1(p)).

region for Sample 1; the ASE laser light was 
shone onto the narrow waveguide end; the high 
asymmetric mode profile can be observed as 
well.  
The spectral characteristics of the ABC-based 
filter were measured using a tunable laser 
system (Q8384 Optical Spectrum Analyzer, 
Advantest Inc., Japan). The output fiber of the 
tunable laser is of Panda-type polarization 
maintaining fiber, with TE mode in the slow 
axis in line with vertical direction. Again, a 
tunable laser light source with a wavelength 
range of 1511-1620 nm was used as the 
wideband light source and followed by a 
polarization controller. An alignment He-Ne 
laser source, used as the auxiliary source, was 
combined with the wideband source using a 2 × 
1 optical fiber coupler. The optical filter was set 
on a micropositioner, and two single mode 
fibers were used as the input and output fibers. 
The input light source was polarized in the TE 
direction, as was the mode field measurement 
system. The output fiber was then connected to 
the receiver end of the tunable laser to 
characterize the filter performance. The 
measurement schematic diagram is depicted in 
Fig. 8. The tunable laser was coupled onto the 
narrow waveguide ends of the filters and 
coupled out from the alternative end of the same 
waveguides. The measured results which are 
similar to the theoretical results depicted in 
Figure. 9. Apart from for the upper transmission 
dips, which resulted from the cross-reflection 
Bragg condition ( 1dλ ), a lower transmission dip 
resulting from the self-reflection Bragg 
condition ( 2dλ ) was observed as well.  
   At the cross-reflection Bragg wavelength, a 
transmission dips of –11.7 dB were obtained for 
Samples 1 (Table 1). At the self-reflection 
Bragg wavelength, the dips were −16.5 dB for 
Samples 1 (Table 1). The measured 
cross-reflection Bragg wavelengths were 
1581.3nm, which are off approximately 0.28nm 
from the theoretical predictions for Samples 1. 
The measured self-reflection Bragg wavelengths 
were 1580.1nm, which are off approximately 
0.22nm from the theoretical predictions for 
Samples. The 3dB transmission bandwidth of 
Sample 1 is approximately 0.5 and 0.6nm for 
the cross-reflection and self-reflection modes, 
respectively. Nevertheless. Different samples 
with the difference of the effective index 
between two waveguides have been used, and 
the transmission spectra of cross- and 
self-reflection would overlap when the 
difference is below 0.0025. The results of 
Sample 1 show that the effective index 
difference should be greater than 0.0025 to 
prevent spectrum overlapping.

cure epoxy. A high aspect ratio and vertical 
waveguide sidewalls are obtained by this 
method, and consistent reproduction of the 
grating on a UV polymer has been achieved 
with this process (W. C. Chuang et al. 2005; W. 
C. Chuang et al. 2007). In this paper, we 
describe a technique that combines the 
holographic interferometry, soft lithography, and 
a simple replication processes for fabricating a 
polymeric ABC. 
The two waveguides are asynchronous because 
the effective refractive indices of the two 
waveguides are quite different. In spite of the 
large index mismatch between the two 
waveguides, an efficient power coupling was 
achieved using the Bragg grating engraved on 
the bottom of the two waveguides. Furthermore, 
an unwanted reflection wavelength, denoted by 
self-reflection Bragg wavelength ( 2dλ ), caused 
by the grating of input waveguide is occurred in 
the input end. The self-reflection light results in 
broadening the transmission spectrum of the 
filters, if its spectrum overlaps with the 
spectrum of cross-reflection light. Such 
unwanted reflection light can be eliminated by 
suppressing the grating depth of the input 
waveguide. Another method is to make the two 
decoupled waveguides quite dissimilar to avoid 
the spectrum overlapping. 
 
三、研究報告內容 
1. Grating Fabrication. 
  A three-step process for the rapid prototyping 
of grating structures on a polymer substrate 
involving was carried out first. A grating pattern 
was holographically exposed using a twobeam 
interference pattern on a positive photoresist 
film (Ultra 123, MicroChem Corp., MA.; 
refractive index = 1.618). This produced a 
master that was subsequently used to produce a 
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold. This 
silicone rubber mold was then used as a stamp 
to transfer the gratings pattern onto a UV cure 
epoxy polymer (OG146, Epoxy Technology Inc., 
USA). The refractive index of epoxy polymer is 
increased by about 0.03 after curing. The 
refractive index of cure epoxy polymer is about 
1.5201 at 1550nm, which was measured by 
using prism coupler system (Model 2010, 
Metricon Inc., USA). . The details of the 
process involved in grating fabrication are 
described in our previous reports (W. C. Chuang 
et al. 2005). The UV polymer with grating was 
cut down to dimensions of 1cm × 5cm, and the 
dimensions of the gratings on the polymer were 
0.9 cm long and 1 mm wide. 
2. Fabrication of the asymmetric Bragg 
couplers (ABC). 
  In order to fabricate asymmetric Bragg 
couplers (ABC), a 700-µm thick glass substrate 
was first cut into a 5cm × 1cm rectangle. After 
substrate cleaning, the UV polymer OG146 with 
a grating period of 510nm and grating depth of 
350nm was deposited on the glass (W. C. 
Chuang et al. 2005); it was coated with a 7.0 
µm thick negative photoresist (SU-8) spun on at 
1000 rpm for 17 seconds. Samples were 
exposed through polyethylene terephthalate 
(PET)-based masks using a UV mask aligner 
(AB-Manufacturing, CA) for 90 seconds; this 
was followed by development in a SU-8 
developer (MicroChem) for 45 seconds to 
obtain a negative waveguide pattern with 
gratings on the bottom. The process flow is 
shown in Fig. 1 (a) - (c). In this study, several 
configurations of ABC filters are fabricated for 
optical characteristic comparison. The details of 
the process are described in the previous reports 
(W. C. Chuang et al. 2006).  
An SEM image of the first waveguide mold 
was taken after the photoresist mold was 
fabricated (Fig. 2), showing the intact grating 
pattern inside the groove. The patterned resist 
was used as a mother mold to transfer the 
pattern onto a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) 
thin film using typical micro-molding 
techniques (e.g., stamping) (J. C. Lötters et al. 
1997; P. Nussbaum et al. 1998; M. Rossi et al. 
2003). The diluted PDMS was coated uniformly 
onto the patterned photoresist. After baking at 
90°C for 1 hr, the PDMS was cured and was 
easily peeled off from the photoresist (Figs. 
1(d)-(e)). Fig. 3 shows the SEM image of the 
PDMS waveguide with gratings. The waveguide 
with the gratings pattern was transferred onto a 
UV polymer (OG146) from the PDMS mold 
using the UV replication process described by 
Rossi and our previous reports (Figs. 1(f)-(h)) 
(W. C. Chuang et al. 2005; M. Rossi et al. 
2003). A spacer with a thickness of 400 µm was 
placed between the mold and a thin Pyrex glass 
slide. After injecting the precured UV polymer 
(OG146), the epoxy was then cured under a 
broadband UV light operating in a wavelength 
 4
(dimensions are 13.8 µm × 7 µm and 13.8 µm × 7 µm, 
the length is 5 cm, the gap is about 3.5 µm, and the 
grating period is 510nm).

and 5(c), dimensions are 13.8µm × 7µm and 13.8µm ×

the grating period is 510nm. 
 
Fig 5.  This is the sectional drawing of the core layer 
(su-8 2005) 
 
3. Simulation.  
  The waveguide properties, including the mode 
pattern and the effective index, were simulated 
using the beam propagation method 
(BPM_CAD, Opti-Wave Inc., Canada). The 
effective indices of the compound modes for 
Sample 1 are 1effn  = 1.55174 and 2effn  = 
1.54939 (Table 1), corresponding to the single 
waveguide modes 
seffn −1  = 1.55180 and 
seffn −2  = 1.54933, respectively. The overlap 
integrals between the single and the compound 
modes are 98.25% and 97.95% for the first and 
second modes, respectively. The simulation 
result shows the waveguides in the sample are 
highly asymmetry.  
  The cross-reflection Bragg wavelengths 1dλ  
are 1581.5763 nm and the selfreflection Bragg 
wavelengths 2dλ  ( 2dλ  = 2 2effn  Λ ) are 
1580.3166 nm (Table 1), as calculated from the 
Bragg reflection conditions for the Sample 1 
filters, with a grating period of 510nm. When 
the core refractive index ranges from 1.549 to 
1.560, the calculated cross-reflection Bragg 
wavelength through the beam propagation 
method varies from 1575.5945 to 1586.5822 
nm for Sample 1. Using the simulation, the 
transmission of the optical filter can be 
calculated using the coupled mode theory (A. 
Yariv 1984), and the calculated results were 
shown in Fig. 10 and Table 1. 
 
Table 1 The simulation and measurement results of 
sample 1 
4. Measurement. 
  The near-field patterns of the optical 
waveguide were observed using the end-fire 
coupling technique. Fig. 6 shows the schematic 
diagram of the measurement system. An 
amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) source 
with a wavelength range of 1530-1560 nm was 
used as the wideband light source (Stabilized 
Light Source, PTS-BBS, Newport Inc., USA). 
The light source was polarized in the TE 
direction using the in-line polarizer (ILP-55-N, 
Advanced Fiber Resources, China), which was 
followed by a polarization controller with an 
operation wavelength of around 1550nm 
(F-POL-PC, Newport Inc., USA). The 
polarization state is examined by using near 
infrared precision linear polarizer (20LP-NIR, 
New Port Inc., USA). The output mode field of 
the waveguide was observed using an IR-CCD 
system (Model 7290A, Micron Viewer, 
Electrophysics Inc., USA) with image analysis 
software (LBA- 710PC-D, V4.17, Spiricon Inc., 
USA) to show the single-mode characteristics of 
the waveguide. Fig. 7 shows the field intensity 
distribution of the two-waveguide-coupled 
 6
interferometry and micro-molding processes. 
The ABC filters are produced by a two-step 
molding process where the master mold is 
first formed on a negative tone photoresist 
and subsequently transferred to a PDMS 
mold; following this step, the PDMS silicon 
rubber mold was used as a stamp to transfer 
the pattern of the ABC filters onto a UV cure 
epoxy. For an ABC filter with dimensions of 
13.8µm × 7µm and 13.8µm × 7µm, length of 
5cm, gap of 3.5µm, grating length of 0.9cm, 
grating period of 510nm, and grating depth 
of 350nm, the transmission dips are 
approximately −16.5 and −11.7dB, and the 
3dB transmission bandwidths are 
approximately 0.6 and 0.5nm. The  
transmission spectrum overlaps when the 
effective index difference between two single 
waveguides is less than 0.0025. This process 
shows great potential for mass production of 
any grating structure on polymer waveguides.
