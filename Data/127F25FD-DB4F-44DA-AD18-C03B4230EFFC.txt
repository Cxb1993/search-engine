Abstract 
 The mixed monolayer behavior of stereoregular poly(methyl methacrylate) 
(PMMA) and poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) was investigated from the measurements of 
surface pressure-area per molecule (π-A) isotherms at three temperatures.  The 
miscibility and nonideality of the mixed monolayers were examined by calculating the 
excess area as a function of composition.  Positive and negative deviations from 
ideality were observed.  Negative deviations observed at high PVAc composition 
might suggest that the existence of favorable interactions between PMMA and PVAc.

interface.  Kawaguchi and coworkers5 have performed surface measurements on 
binary mixtures among poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), poly(methacrylate) (PMA), 
poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc), and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) at the air-water 
interface.   PEO/PMMA and PMA/PVAc mixtures are miscible over the entire 
composition.  In PVAc/PMMA mixtures, the repulsive interaction is dominant, and 
the mixtures are thermodynamically unstable and should not be miscible.  For 
PVAc/PEO mixtures, the attractive interaction is observed below the collapse pressure 
of PEO, i.e. 10 mN/m.  Their results correlate well with the miscibility of the 
corresponding mixtures in the bulk state. 
  In a previous study12, the miscibility of stereoregular PMMA with PVAc was 
investigated in this laboratory.  Based upon the results of the prepared blends, 
casting solvent and tacticity of PMMA have little effect on the miscibility of PMMA 
with PVAc.  PMMA was found to be almost completely immiscible with PVAc.  
Through the calculation of phase compositions of two immiscible phases, the blends 
prepared from THF show a little more practical miscibility than the ones cast from 
chloroform.  Among the three tactic PMMAs, isotactic PMMA was found to show 
the highest mutual solubility with PVAc when the blends were cast from THF. 
The aim of this paper is to compare the miscibility of streoregular PMMA with 
PVAc in two-dimensional state with that of polymers in the bulk state.  We measured 
the surface pressures of the binary films of stereoregular PMMA/PVAc ( the same 
polymers as in reference 12 ).  On the basis of the results of surface pressure-area per 
molecule (π-A) isotherms, miscibility between stereoregular PMMA and PVAc was 
investigated in this article.  The effect of tacticity and composition of PMMA on its 
miscibility with PVAc was expounded and reported detail in this article.  To the best 
of our knowledge, there is no systematic and detailed report on the miscibility of 
mixed stereoregular PMMA/PVAc monolayers at the air-water interface.

Teflon trough was 320 mm long and 75 mm wide.  Regulation of the trough 
temperature was controlled by circulating constant temperature water from an external 
circulator through the tubes attached to the aluminum-based plate of the trough.  The 
trough was placed on an isolated vibration-free table and was enclosed in a glass 
chamber to avoid contaminants from the air.  A computer with an interface unit 
obtained from KSV instruments Ltd. was used to control the Teflon barriers.  One of 
the important characteristics of the trough system is that two barriers confining a 
monolayer at the interface are driven symmetrically during the compression of the 
monolayer.  The surface pressure was measured by the Wilhelmy plate method.  
The resolution for surface measurement is 0.004 mN/m, and the inaccuracy of surface 
area regulation is less than 1%, according to the specifications of the instruments. A 
surface pressure-area per molecule (π-A) isotherm was obtained by a continuous 
compression of a monolayer at the interface by two barriers.  Before each isotherm 
measurement, the trough and barriers were cleaned with an ethanol solution and then 
rinsed by purified water.  The sand blasted platinum plate used for surface pressure 
measurements was also rinsed with purified water and then flamed before use.  In 
addition, all glassware was cleaned prior to use in the same manner as the trough and 
barrier. 
For starting the experiment, the freshly cleaned trough was placed into position in 
the apparatus first, then it was filled with purified water as the subphase with  
temperatures controlled at 10±1℃, 25±1℃ and 40±1℃.  The clean platinum plate 
was hanged in the appropriate position for surface pressure measurements.  The 
surface pressure fluctuation was estimated to be less than 0.2 mN/m during the 
compression of the entire trough surface area range.  Then, the two barriers were 
moved back to their initial positions, and a sample containing monolayer-forming 
materials was spread on the subphase by using a Hamilton microsyringe.  At least 20 
min was allowed for evaporation of the spreading solvent.  After the solvent was

Results and Discussion 
Single Polymer Film 
The π-A isotherms of monolayers for the three PMMA stereoisomers and PVAc 
are shown in Figure1(a)-(c) at 10℃, 25℃ and 40 ℃, respectively.  The discussion 
for the three stereoisomers at three temperatures was reported previously14 and 
therefore omitted here.  The results are consistent with that reported by Beredjick.15 
The π-A isotherms of PVAc ( shown in Figure 1(a)-(c) ) at three temperatures 
were in agreement with literature16-18 .  The isotherm of PVAc belongs to the 
expanded film type.  At 10℃ , the collapse pressure of PVAc is detectable.  
However, at 25℃ and 40 ℃ the collapse pressure of PVAc can not be detected 
likely due to more flexible chain motion at higher temperatures. 
 
PMMA/PVAc Mixture 
Figure 2 presents the π-A isotherms of mixed monolayers for (a) iPMMA/PVAc, 
(b) sPMMA/PVAc and (c) aPMMA/PVAc at 10℃.  Figures 3 and 4 show the π-A 
isotherms of the same polymers at 25℃ and 40 ℃, respectively. 
For Figure 2(a)-2(c) the π-A isotherms of mixed monolayers at 10℃ are located 
mostly in the middle of corresponding homopolymer isotherms.  However, for 
iPMMA/PVAc(25/75) and aPMMA/PVAc(25/75) their isotherms are to the left of 
PVAc isotherm.  Therefore negative deviations were obviously observed in these 
mixed monolayers.  The π-A isotherms of mixed monolayers at 25℃ shown in 
Figure 3(a)-3(c) are in the majority located in between corresponding homopolymer 
isotherms.  The only exception is aPMMA/PVAc(25/75) mixed monolayer.  Its 
isotherm is outside of PVAc and aPMMA isotherms and demonstrates smaller surface 
area than PVAc at the same surface pressure.  For Figure 4(a)-4(c) the π-A isotherms 
of mixed monolayers at 40℃ demonstrate quite different behavior from those at 10℃ 
and 25℃ .  Most isotherms are located either to the left or to the right of 
 10
indicating PMMA and PVAc are less stable at 25℃ than at 10℃.  However, 
aPMMA is miscible with PVAc is miscible with PVAc at high PVAc mole function 
because of the observation of negative Aex/Aid values shown in Figure 6(c).  For 
iPMMA/PVAc and aPMMA/PVAc mixed monolayers, the increase of surface 
pressure is beneficial to the decrease of the Aex/Aid values. 
At 40℃ the Aex/Aid values of iPMMA, sPMMA and aPMMA with PVAc are 
expounded as below.  For Figure 7(a) iPMMA and PVAc are miscible at high PVAc 
mole fraction because of negative Aex/Aid values.  For low or mid PVAc composition 
in Figure 7(a), the Aex/Aid values are mostly positive.  For sPMMA and PVAc 
isotherms shown in Figure 7(b) the Aex/Aid values are in the majority positive.  The 
only exception is sPMMA/PVAc monolayers with high PVAc mole fraction and at 
high surface pressure.   The negative Aex/Aid values were observed indicating 
miscibility between sPMMA and PVAc.  A quite unusual behavior was observed in 
aPMMA/PVAc isotherms at 40℃ shown in Figure 7(c).  At low or high PVAc 
composition, the Aex/Aid values are negative indicating miscibility between aPMMA 
and PVAc.  However, positive Aex/Aid values were observed at mid PVAc 
composition.  The PVAc/aPMMA monolayers are less stable at mid PVAc 
composition.
