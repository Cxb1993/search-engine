Abstract 
The objective of this project is to develop 
three-dimensional dynamic flow solvers on 
unstructured meshes to study turbulent flows 
over vibrating blades with interblade phase 
angles and blade tip clearances.  To reduce the 
computational time tremendously, the 
single-blade approach with the phase-shifted 
periodic boundary treatment for arbitrary 
interblade phase angles will be implemented to 
confine the computational domain to be 
one-blade only, instead of using multiple-blades 
approach with the simple spatially periodic 
boundary treatment.  The present 3-D dynamic 
flow solvers incorporate the locally implicit 
finite volume scheme, dynamic mesh algorithm, 
phase-shifted periodic boundary treatment and 
anisotropic dissipation model on unstructured 
tetrahedral meshes. The three-dimensional, 
unsteady Favre-averaged Navier-Stokes 
equations with moving domain effects and a 
two-equation low-Reynolds-number k-ε 
turbulence model are solved in the Cartesian 
coordinate system.  To accurately calculate 
fluxes across moving cell surfaces, a 3-D 
geometric conservation law has to be satisfied in 
addition to mass, momentum and energy 
conservation laws. 
This project is divided into two years. The 
first year focuses on the development, 
assessment and investigation of present 3-D 
dynamic flow solvers on static unstructured 
meshes.  The transonic flow around an ONERA 
M6 wing is investigated.  After comparing the 
calculated pressure coefficient distributions at 
different spanwise cross sections with those of 
related experimental results, the accuracy and 
efficiency of the present 3-D dynamic flow 
solvers on static unstructured meshes are 
confirmed.  After completing this project, the 
computational capability and knowledge of 
three-dimensional dynamic turbulent flow 
calculations on unstructured meshes are 
promoted.  The results of this project are 
valuable academic references to those who are 
interested in this field.

the process of grid generation for complex 
geometries is greatly simplified.  Also mentioned 
by Mavriplis [21], unstructured grid techniques 
offered the potential for greatly reducing the grid 
generation time associated with complex 
geometries.  Furthermore, unstructured mesh 
approaches enabled the use of adaptive meshing 
techniques, which held great promise for 
increasing solution accuracy at minimal additional 
computational cost.  Recently, considerable effort 
has been made to develop solution techniques 
[20-38] for solving the Euler/Navier-Stokes 
equations on unstructured meshes.  A novel 
strategy [22], which included the elements of the 
no cavity and nonoverlapping conditions and a 
mesh generation technique, was presented to 
create tetrahedral meshes.  An object-oriented 
approach [23] was presented for automatic 
parallel advancing front based surface mesh 
generation and adaptive remeshing for complex 
configurations, whereas a simple embedded 
domain method for node-based unstructured grid 
solver [24] was presented with mesh refinement 
based on proximity to the embedded surfaces.  
An unstructured dynamic mesh adaptation and 
load balancing algorithm [25] had been 
developed for the efficient simulation of 
three-dimensional unsteady inviscid flows on 
parallel machines. The resolution of 
time-dependent solutions was enhanced by 
adopting an h-refinement/coarsening algorithm.  
A three-dimensional unstructured dynamic mesh 
method [26] for viscous flow computation was 
presented to simulate aircraft performance when 
control surface deflection was changed. The 
unstructured hybrid meshes comprised of 
tetrahedral, prisms and pyramids.  Farhat et al. 
[27] presented a dynamic version of the 
variational multiscale method for large eddy 
simulation on unstructured meshes of turbulent 
compressible flows, where two variational 
analogues of Germano’s algebraic identity and a 
computationally efficient agglomeration-based 
numerical procedure were included as key 
features.  Based on a finite volume/finite 
element discretization of the compressible 
Navier-Stokes equations on unstructured grids 
and a Roe second-order scheme with MUSCL 
extrapolation [28], large-eddy simulations had 
been performed of a compressed vortex flow 
undergoing transition to turbulence. 
An implicit multigrid-driven algorithm [29] 
for two-dimensional incompressible laminar 
flows had been coupled with a solution 
adaptation method and a mesh movement 
method for boundary movement.  Time 
dependent calculations were performed 
implicitly by regarding each time step as a steady 
state problem in pseudo-time.  Large eddy 
simulations [30] were performed to reproduce 
the generation and breakdown of a tumbling 
motion in the simplified model engine, where a 
second order accurate numerical scheme was 
applied in conjunction with a fixed finite 
volume/finite element formulation adapted for 
unstructured deforming meshes.  Acharya et al. 
[31] reviewed the basics of the finite volume 
method and traced its extension to unstructured 
meshes through the use of cell-based and control 
volume finite element schemes. The 
development of staggered mesh schemes and 
segregated solution techniques such as the 
SIMPLE algorithm were also reviewed.  An 
adaptive mesh moving technique [32] was 
presented for three dimensional fluid flow 
problems that involved moving fluid boundaries 
and fluid-solid interfaces. Such mesh moving 
techniques are an essential ingredient of 
fluid-structure interaction methods that typically 
employed arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian 
frameworks.  The approximation power of 
moving least squares [33] in the context of 
higher order finite volume schemes on 
unstructured grids was explored. It allowed the 
direction reconstruction of high order viscous 
fluxes using quite compact stencils and without 
introducing new degrees of freedom.  High 
order essentially non-oscillatory schemes [34] 
were applied to high speed flows on unstructured 
meshes. The entire reconstruction process was 
described with emphasis on the stencil selection 
algorithms.  A Newton-Krylov algorithm [35] 
was presented for the compressible 
Navier-Stokes equations in three dimensions on 
unstructured grid. The algorithm used a 
preconditioned matrix-free Krylov method to 
solve the linear system that arose in the Newton 
iterations.  Maire and Breil [36] presented a 
new second-order cell-centered scheme to 
simulate compressible fluid flows. It was 
developed on general unstructured meshes 
consisting of arbitrary polygons.  The accuracy

  To solve Equation (6), a locally implicit 
scheme [43-45] is implemented.  This scheme is 
locally implicit, but globally explicit and is 
unconditionally stable under local linearized 
analysis.  It does not require the assembly of 
any global matrices and does not need any matrix 
system solvers. The locally implicit scheme was 
developed on structured quadrilaterals originally.  
In this project principal investigator’s previous 
study [42], the 2-D locally implicit scheme and 
2-D anisotropic dissipation model were 
developed on the quadrilateral-triangular mesh 
for turbulent flow calculations.  In this project, 
the 3-D locally implicit scheme and 3-D 
anisotropic dissipation model are developed on 
unstructured tetrahedral meshes. For each 
tetrahedral cell i, the equation for iterative 
corrections is written as

where CFL is the Courant–Friedrichs-Lewy

Equation (7) takes the latest available values 
from Equation (8).  The inner iteration 
forΔU(m+1) can be computed rapidly since the dU 
corrections are explicit scalar equations.  One 
symmetric cycle of inner iterations is employed 
in each time step for steady flow calculations, 
whereas several cycles are performed until a 
convergence state of ( )1+Δ miU  is reached for 
unsteady flow calculations. At the end of a time

In the present calculations, no-penetration and 
adiabatic wall conditions are imposed on the 
wing surface.  Pressure is obtained by 
extrapolation from the values at the interior cells.

As for the far field of transonic flow around an 
ONERA M6 wing, the characteristic analysis 
based on Riemann Invariants is used to 
determine the values of flow variables on the 
outer boundary of the computational domain.

After completing this project, four major 
items have been achieved and stated as follows. 
1. The first year focuses on the 
development, assessment and 
investigation of present 3-D dynamic 
flow solvers on static unstructured 
tetrahedral meshes.  The development 
of 3-D anisotropic dissipation model as 
well as 3-D locally implicit scheme on 
static unstructured tetrahedrons is

Abstract: A locally implicit scheme with an anisotropic dissipation model on three-dimensional unstructured 
tetrahedral mesh is developed to study the transonic flow around an ONERA M6 wing.  In the Cartesian coordinate 
system, 3-D Euler equations are solved using a cell-centered finite volume algorithm.  This scheme is locally 
implicit, but globally explicit and is unconditionally stable under local linearized analysis.  It does not require the 
assembly of any global matrices and does not need any matrix system solvers.  To assess the accuracy and 
efficiency of the present flow solver on unstructured tetrahedrons, the transonic flow around an ONERA M6 wing is 
investigated.  After comparing the calculated pressure coefficient distributions at different spanwise cross sections 
with those of experimental results, the accuracy and efficiency of the present 3-D flow solver on unstructured 
tetrahedral mesh are confirmed.   
 
1. Introduction 
Unstructured meshes have been a major concern in the 
development of computational fluid dynamics.  As 
mentioned by Sheng et al. (1999), the biggest advantage of 
the unstructured grid approach over the structured grid 
approach is that the process of grid generation for complex 
geometries is greatly simplified.  Also mentioned by 
Mavriplis (2000), unstructured grid techniques offered the 
potential for greatly reducing the grid generation time 
associated with complex geometries.  Furthermore, 
unstructured mesh approaches enabled the use of adaptive 
meshing techniques, which held great promise for 
increasing solution accuracy at minimal additional 
computational cost.  Recently, considerable effort has been 
made to develop solution techniques for solving the 
Euler/Navier-Stokes equations on unstructured meshes.  A 
novel strategy (Liu and Hwang, 2001), which included 
the elements of the no cavity and nonoverlapping 
conditions and a mesh generation technique, was 
presented to create tetrahedral meshes.  An unstructured 
dynamic mesh adaptation and load balancing algorithm 
(Park and Kwon, 2005) had been developed for the 
efficient simulation of three-dimensional unsteady 
inviscid flows on parallel machines. The resolution of 
time-dependent solutions was enhanced by adopting an 
h-refinement/coarsening algorithm.  Farhat et al. (2006) 
presented a dynamic version of the variational multiscale 
method for large eddy simulation on unstructured meshes 
of turbulent compressible flows, where two variational 
analogues of Germano’s algebraic identity and a 
computationally efficient agglomeration-based numerical 
procedure were included as key features.  Acharya et al. 
(2007) reviewed the basics of the finite volume method 
and traced its extension to unstructured meshes through 
the use of cell-based and control volume finite element 
schemes. The development of staggered mesh schemes 
and segregated solution techniques such as the SIMPLE 
algorithm were also reviewed.  A Newton-Krylov 
algorithm (Wong and Zingg, 2008) was presented for the 
compressible Navier-Stokes equations in three 
dimensions on unstructured grid. The algorithm used a 
preconditioned matrix-free Krylov method to solve the 
linear system that arose in the Newton iterations.              
  As for the dissipation model, Jameson et al. (1981) had 
developed an effective form on the structured grid 
sysytem. The isotropic value for scaling the dissipation 
was extended to unstructured triangular meshes by 
Mavriplis (1990).  On the static triangular mesh, Hwang 
and Liu (1991) developed the anisotropic dissipation 
model.  In the author’s previous study (Yang, 2004), the 
anisotropic dissipation model was developed on the 
dynamic quadrilateral-triangular mesh for 2-D turbulent

  To solve Equation (6), a locally implicit scheme (Yang, 
2004) is implemented.   
   
3. Boundary conditions 
  In the present calculations, no-penetration and 
adiabatic wall conditions are imposed on the wing 
surface.  Pressure is obtained by extrapolation from the 
values at the interior cells.  Density is obtained from the 
equation of state.  As for the far field of transonic flow 
around an ONERA M6 wing, the characteristic analysis 
based on Riemann Invariants is used to determine the 
values of flow variables on the outer boundary of the 
computational domain. 
    
4. Results and discussion 
To assess the accuracy and efficiency of the present 
3-D flow solvers on static unstructured tetrahedrons, the 
transonic flow around an ONERA M6 wing is 
investigated. In this flow problem, the aspect and taper 
ratios of the ONERA M6 wing are 3.8 and 0.56, 
respectively.  As for the computational domain, the 
ONERA M6 wing with a semispan of 1.0, a root chord of 
0.6775 and a leading edge sweep of 30 deg is enclosed 
by a symmetric plane and several far-field planes which 
are at least 20 semispans away from the wing.  The free 
stream Mach number and angle of attack are set to be 
0.84 and 3.06 deg., respectively.  The global and local 
views of unstructured tetrahedral mesh for the transonic 
flow around an ONERA M6 wing are plotted in Figs. 1(a) 
and 1(b), respectively.  After comparing the calculated 
pressure coefficient distributions at different spanwise 
cross sections shown in Figs. 2(a)-(c) with those of 
experimental (Schmidt and Charpin, 1979) results, the 
accuracy of the present 3-D flow solver on unstructured 
tetrahedral mesh is demonstrated. The unstructured 
tetrahedrons are generated using a 3-D unstructured 
mesh generation strategy (Liu and Hwang, 2001), where 
the no-cavity and nonoverlapping conditions are imposed. 
The capability of shock capturing at different wing 
spanwise cross sections is demonstrated in Figs. 2(a)-(c).  
The triple shock wave structure is also depicted on the 
upper wing surface. 
 
5. Conclusions 
The main contribution of this paper is to develop a 
locally implicit scheme with an anisotropic dissipation 
model on three-dimensional unstructured tetrahedral 
mesh. In the Cartesian coordinate system, 3-D Euler 
equations are solved using a cell-centered finite volume 
algorithm.  In this paper, the anisotropic value for 
scaling the dissipation on unstructured tetrahedrons is 
presented, and the spectral radius of Jacobian matrix on 
the interface between two adjacent cells is introduced.  
To assess the accuracy and efficiency of the present flow 
solver on unstructured tetrahedrons, the transonic flow 
around an ONERA M6 wing is investigated. After 
comparing the calculated pressure coefficient 
distributions at different spanwise cross sections with 
those of related numerical and experimental results, the 
accuracy and efficiency of the present 3-D flow solver on 
unstructured tetrahedral mesh are confirmed.  The 
capability of shock capturing at different wing spanwise 
cross sections is demonstrated.
