each diversity branch to perform combined MAI and 
precursor ISI cancellation, while leaving the 
postcursor ISI to be mitigated by the subsequent 
symbol-spaced feedback filter (FBF). Unlike several 
previous work related to MIMO systems, precoding 
matrix was considered on the transmit antenna branch 
in our proposed structure. The transmitter and 
receiver filters of MIMO are optimized jointly 
according to the minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) 
criterion. Even though the precoding process on the 
transmitter was considered in some work, no 
continuous pulse shaping filter and MAI are taken 
into account. The error probability is calculated 
fast and accurately using a semi-analytical 
techniques along with the Gauss quadrature rule (GQR) 
approach based on the method of moments which can 
approximate the probability density function of the 
combined output ISI and MAI. Such an approach avoids 
a Gaussian characterization of interference, which is 
not realistic because MAI has the effects of pulse 
waveform, modulation and fading.

2separating the users in an SDMA system. Spatial-temporal
processing, i.e. temporal equalization with multiple
antennas, is an attractive technology to combat those
impairments (MAI, ISI and fading) simultaneously for a
space-division multiple access (SDMA). It can be shown,
however, that interference limitations are due largely to the
use of nonoptimal signal processing in the demodulator and
are not due to fundamental characteristics of the channel.
A number of equalization methods deal efficiently with
CCI or MAI and can potentially result in increased system
efficiency in terms of the number of users that can be
accommodated in a given bandwidth, as well as system
reliability and robustness [1]-[13]. The use of a DFE instead
of a linear equalizer may reduce the noise enhancement
effect, and also affords the forward linear filter greater
flexibility in handling ISI as well as CCI or MAI. The
performance of spatial-temporal processing with a MMSE-
DFE and maximum likelihood sequence estimator (MLSE)
at the combiner output of symbol-spaced FFFs for Enhanced
Data Rates for Global Evolution (EDGE) wireless systems
was studied in [10]-[12]. Similar to the structure in [3][8][9],
the use of the two-sided symbol-spaced FFF in [8]-[11] may
in practice be expected to yield higher noise enhancement. A
MLSE-type canceller studied in [13] is also more complex
and not realistic, since all cochannel signals have to be
detected. A minimum bit error rate (MBER) design is
involved for the MUD using anti-causal symbol-spaced
filters, which is shown to be capable of improving the
achievable bit error rate performance and enhancing the
attainable system capacity over that of the MMSE design.
In recent years, multi-input multiple-output (MIMO)
transceiver design, which promise significant increases in
system performance and capacity, has received a great deal
of attention. The performance of MIMO systems based on
maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and MMSE based
optimal transmission (OT) over flat-fading channels was
studied in [14]-[19]. With no CCI, the performance of
MIMO systems based on Maximum Ratio Transmission
(MRT) in a Rayleigh fading channel was studied in [14]-
[16]. In the presence of CCI, the outage performances based
on Maximum Ratio Transmission (MRT) [17] and Optimum
Transmission (OT) [18][19] were studied. However, the
MIMO system for frequency-selective fading has rarely
been discussed. A zero-forcing DFE transceiver design over
MIMO channel using space-time generalized triangular
decomposition (ST-GTD) in [20]. Spatial and temporal
precoding to take advantage of the diversity offered by time-
varying channels [21]. Even though precoding matrix was
considered on the transmit antenna branch, the use of
anticausal symbol-spaced may degrade the performance
significant when the continuous pulse shaping filter are
taken into account. The approach may be not practical for
the application of the communication systems and result in
the use of nonoptimal signal processing in the demodulator.
Moreover, no MAI from other cells are considered. In
addition, the error rate obtained by counting the error bits
over several random trials of independent channel
realizations and data symbols may be not accurate. A MIMO
channel model can furthermore be used for designing
multiuser detectors, which simultaneously detect several
symbol streams. Such a MIMO model may also be used to
describe a situation, where one user terminal is equipped
with several transmitter antennas.
This research proposes a multi-input multiple-output
(MIMO) receiver with double-sided decision feedback
equalization (DFE) scheme for wideband transmission
systems in cellular mobile radios, which also can be
extended to multiuser detection (MUD). the comparison
between linear and DFE detections using finite taps will be
investigated. The DFEs of different length are considered.
Because of fairly cumbersome evaluation procedure to
compute the exact error probability in the presence of ISI,
CCI or MAI, the Gaussian-like may be inaccurate for fewer
users. The use of Gaussian quadrature rules (GQR) can
overcome this limitation.
MIMO System Modeling
A MIMO system equipped with J antenna elements at
the transmitter and K antenna elements at the receiver is
shown in Fig. 1. We first consider the linear equalization
(LE) case, and then extend to the decision-feedback
equalization (DFE) case. It is assumed that there exist totally
L interferers from the neighboring cells in a TDMA system
or from the same cells in a SDMA system. For a QAM
signal, we denote the ith transmitted complex data symbols
as . The symbols and on the in-
phase and quadrature paths define the signal constellation of
the QAM signal with points. In the constellation, we take
. The desired symbol
sequence is indexed by , and CCI sources by
( for CCI). We denote the as the transmit
precode weight on the kth antenna ( ). where is
the symbol interval. Since the CCI transmit weights are not
controlled by the desired receiver, the transmit weights of
CCI can be neglected. The transmit filter response ,
having a square-root raised cosine frequency response with a
roll-off factor.
The fading channel is spatially independent under a
valid assumption when the antenna spacing is sufficiently
large and the delay spread is large. We use the 2-ray
Rayleigh fading channel model, which generally was used to
analyze the performance of mobile radio systems over
frequency-selective fading, and usually is considered as the
worst case model. For this channel model, the response can
be characterized by ,
where , , , and are zero-mean, i.i.d. Gaussian
random variables with the same variance. The represents
the sufficient time delay between the two rays, which is
usually less than T, to induce frequency selectivity (time
dispersion) of a multipath fading channel. The channel
response between the jth transmit antenna and the kth
receive antenna for the desired signal is represented by .
For the ith CCI source, the channel response on the kth
receive antenna can be represented by .
It is assumed that the frequency tracking, phase
tracking and symbol synchronization are perfect for the
desired signal. The received signal of the kth receive antenna
can be written as
(1)
where is the response
between the jth transmit antenna and the kth receive antenna
for the desired signal; is the channel
response on kth receive antenna for the ith interferer. The

4Next the MIMO system with DFE is considered. The
use of a DFE instead of a linear equalizer may reduce the
noise enhancement effect. For such a structure, the use of
one-sided anti-causal feed-forward filters (FFF) can
eliminated the postcursive ISI in absence of CCI. We let
be the Cholesky decomposition of , where
. The matrix is a real nonsingular upper
triangular matrix and theoretically is positive definite.
is a lower triangular matrix. can be seen as the
postcursive ISI part and can be eliminated by a causal filter.
Therefore, Eq. (6) can be rewritten as .
It is found that the transmitting weight vector is
the unitary eigenvector corresponding to the largest
eigenvalue, , of the quadrature form .
MIMO with CCI cancellationm (OT)
In the presence of CCI, the optimal strategy is to
choose the transmission and combining weight to minimize
both of the noise and CCI. We define the total channel
response as , the combination of the
channel and the filter for the ith user. The sampled responses
are then
(7)
The response of CCI can be expressed in a matrix form. The
impulse response for the desired user can be expressed in a
matrix
(8)
where is a submatrix composed of
, , . Similar
to Eq.5, the convolution matrix is written as
(9)
Similarly, for the linear equalization, the transmitting weight
vectors and can be obtained by replacing in Eq. 6
with that in Eq. 9. The resulting MMSE is derived as
when interference is present. The
noise may be largely enhanced, while the MIMO with linear
equalization intend to eliminate interference. The use of a
DFE reduce the noise enhancement effect, and also affords
the forward linear filter greater flexibility in handling ISI as
well as interference.
The DFE is the equalizer that eliminates all ISI and
MAI or CCI at the input of the decision device, assuming
that all past decisions were corrected. In order to achieve
satisfactory interference cancellation without the
requirement of the detected signal from interference, we
rewrite the in the following form
(10)
We let be the Cholesky decomposition of
, where . The matrix is a real
nonsingular upper triangular matrix. is the postcursive
ISI of the desired signal which can be eliminated by a causal
feedback filter. Hence, we define
(11)
Similarly, the transmitting weight vector can be found
from the quadrature form . From the above
derivation, it is seen that the use of double-sided symbol-
spaced FFF can eliminate ISI and interference for the MIMO
system.
For the GQR method, the precise probability of error
can be calculated from the pulse responses of the desired
signal and all interferers as well as the noise power sampled
every T second at the output of the equalizer. The equalized
output pulses of the desired signal can be obtained by using
(12)
The equalized output pulses of the ith interferer are
(13)
Since the noises at each antenna branch are statically
independent and stationary, the equalized noise is
independent of the instant of the sampling time and thus
power can be calculated as
(14)
For DFE, equalized pulse of the desired signal
for , provided that previous decisions are correct and
the length of the feedback filter is enough to cancel all
postcursive ISI.
Performance Evaluation
The price paid for using Monte Carlo methods is the
run time required for executing the simulation. If the system
and the channel model are complicated and the BER is low,
the required run time is sometimes so long that the use of
Monte Carlo techniques becomes impractical for all but the
most important simulations, especially in the fading case.
The upper bound may be a very loose bound. Since the
receiver is linear, and noise is additive and Gaussian at the
receiver input, the noise at the output will be also be additive
and Gaussian in our case. we can use the semi-analytic
approach for performance estimation.
Since the receiver is linear, and noise is additive and
Gaussian at the receiver input, the noise at the output is also
additive and Gaussian in our case. Hence, we can use the
semi-analytic approach for performance estimation. Semi-
analytic error probability estimation can be sped up
considerably by combining the transmit filter, the channel,
the receiver, and the equalizer into one single response
. The equivalent representation is very
computationally efficient. For this case, the estimate of the
symbol can be expressed as

MMSE Space-time Multiuser Decision-Feedback
Detection in Multiple-antenna SDMA Systems over
Dispersive Fading Channels
Sheng-Chou Lin*
Abstract  This paper analyzes the performance of space-time
decision feedback equalization (STDFE) assisted multiuser
detection (MUD) for multiple-antenna space division multiple
access (SDMA) systems to improve system capacity over dispersive
fading channels. The MUD-STDFE receiver consists of a bank of
matched filters and symbol-spaced feedforward filters (FFF) that
both spatially and temporally whitens noise and the precursive
parts of multiple access interference (MAI), followed by a bank of
causal feedback filters (FBF) to cancel postcursive ISI and MAI
for each user. The algorithm for computing this multi-dimensional
FFF and FBF coefficients is presented, based on minimum mean-
squared error (MMSE) optimality criterion. The error probability
is estimated accurately and efficiently using the Gauss quadrature
rule (GQR). The proposed MUD-STDFE receiver is capable of
improving the performance significantly, separating the users and
offering a significant performance gain relative to linear MMSE
detection in an SDMA system.
I. INTRODUCTION
The performance characteristics of multiple-access channels
featuring traditional demodulation techniques are limited by
multiple-access interference (MAI). It can be shown, however,
that such limitations are largely due to the use of nonoptimal
signal processing in the demodulator and are not due to
fundamental characteristics of the channel. Multiuser detection
(MUD) seeks to remove this MAI limitation by the use of
appropriate signal processing. In a CDMA system, each user is
spread by user-specific spreading code. The performance of
multiuser detection (MUD) schemes for cochannel signals has
been studied in spread-spectrum communications where a
number of approaches have been proposed for the special case
of asynchronous CDMA systems [1]-[5]. Multiuser detection
(MUD) techniques has shown that, for reasonably high symbol-
energy-to-noise ratios, performance is very near single-user
communications with the optimal multiuser detector [1]. An
SDMA system differentiates each user by the associated unique
user-specific channel impulse response (CIR) encountered at
the receiver antennas, but the CIR-signatures are not orthogonal
to each other. Due to the non-orthogonal nature of the CIRs, an
effective multiuser receiver in combination with antenna arrays
is needed to separate the users in an SDMA system.
In a single-user system, optimum MMSE linear diversity
combining has been shown to be an effective structure for
cancelling ISI and CCI in [6]. Sophisticated equalizers, e.g.
decision-feedback equalization (DFE) or maximum likelihood
sequence detector (MLSE) are used to improve the performance
of space-time (ST) receiver [7]-[11]. Another strategy for
equalizer design is to use the minimum bit error rate (MBER)
criterion [12]-[14]. Through better results can be obtained in
terms of the MBER criterion, the convergence rate may be
slower and the computational complexity may be higher [15].
Those ST single-user detection technology can be extended to
multiuser detection (MUD) systems. The linear multiuser
equalizers often provided a reasonable trade-off between
detector complexity and performance. However, successive
cancellation schemes may be employed as an alternative to
linear multiuser techniques to further improve performance at
some additional cost in complexity. Use of successive
cancellation to remove MAI is similar to decision feedback
equalization in single-user settings to remove ISI. In this sense,
DFEs constitute a particular class of successive cancellation
schemes that remove MAI and ISI based on hard estimates of
detected symbols. A multiuser MMSE DFE for fixed channel
that is a generalization of its single-user counterpart was
derived in [4][16]. The derivation in the D-transform domains is
too complicated and therefore becomes impractical in
simulation. In the MBER MUD-DFE discussed in [17], the
choice of the ST-DFE may not be optimal, but just guarantee an
adequate performance, since it is assumed that all postcursive
terms vanishes before optimization.
Generally, no pulse shaping filter, modulation and fading
effect were taken into account in most of the previous work.
Such an approach may be not practical for the application of
communication systems. Against this background, the novelty
of this paper is that the calculation and performance analysis of
the finite-length MMSE MUD-STDFE are presented for the
first time in the literature in the context of practical SDMA
systems. The error probability is accessed via semi-analytic
technology using GQR based on the method of moments. This
method can approximate the probability density function (pdf)
of the combined ISI and MAI based on the impulse responses of
the desired and MAI signals along with the noise at the output
of the ST detector. The methods used for the estimation of error
probability seem to be too complex [10], inaccurate [9][11] or
time-consuming [10][15] for severely dispersive channels,
compared to the GQR method.
II. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
The system is modeled assuming that L users transmit QAM
signal over the frequency-selective multipath fading channels to
a multiuser detection (MUD) receiver with K diversity
antennas. The users are indexed by and the

Assume that the transversal filter has been set

Even though the noise at each diversity branch is statically

Unlike interference cancellation for a single-user STDFE [7]-
[11], a DFE in a multiuser setting uses past decisions from all
users in order to remove ISI and MAI. The optimum MUD with
the DFE structure consists of a bank of anti-causal feedforward
transversal filters (FFF) and a bank of causal decision-feedback
filters (FBF) for each user, as shown in Fig. 1. The output of
user i at time can be expressed as
(9)
where and are the weight coefficients of
the anticausal feed-forward and causal feedback filters
separately for the ith user; and represent the length of the
FFF and FBF; and represent the finite-length convolution
operations from to 0 and from 1 to , respectively. When
designing DFEs, it is assumed that all the past decisions are
correct; this implies that the equalizer is operating at a
sufficiently high-SNR that the decisions it makes are correct
with high probability. The multi-dimensional feedback filter
bank is used to remove postcursive ISI and MAI from the
present estimate caused by previously detected symbols of all
users. Therefore, we have
(10)
where and is the matrix of the FFF bank.
We can obtain the multi-dimensional feedforward filter for each
user by solving the set of linear equations
(11)
where we note and .
Similarly, the vector of the equalized pulses of user i is given
by and we
have , where represents
the tap vector of the FFF for the ith user. The equalized pulses
from all users for user i can be written as
, and . (12)
i.e. for , provided that previous
decisions are correct. Similarly, the equalized noise power for
the ith user is given by
(13)
The use of a DFE can reduce the effect of noise enhancement at
the frequency band while eliminating both ISI and MAI for this
MUD scheme.
III. ERROR PROBABILITY ESTIMATION
Average performance due to fading effects is evaluated by
averaging the performance over all possible varying channel
parameters. The individual run for each fading channel has to be
computationally efficient and accurate. We here use a method
which can fulfill the requirements for efficiency and accuracy.
We start with the estimate of the symbol for user i, which can be
expressed as
(14)
where are the complex-
valued equalized responses. Output noise samples are denoted
by where and are identically
distributed Gaussian random variables having the same
variance equal to . With a slight change in signal
indexing, we can denote the joint ISI and MAI in the in-phase

V. CONCLUSION
This paper has presented the analysis of an optimum finite-
length MUD-STDFE for a multiple-antenna receiver in SDMA
systems over fading channels. Our analysis accounts for pulse
waveform, modulation and fading of the signal and MAI. The
use of GQR demonstrates the robust accuracy and speed in
simulation. We derive the explicit expressions for the MMSE
MUD-STDFE and demonstrate comparative performance with
MUD-STLE, which are novel to the best of our knowledge.
With such a scheme, the STDFE can further improve immunity
to ISI/MAI and achieve satisfactory performance when the
number of antennas is higher than the number of interferers.

can be neglected. Thus, the ith transmit cochannel interference
can be combined as
(2)
where is the sequence of complex data
symbols and is the symbol interval. The data symbols
and on the in-phase and quadrature paths define the signal
constellation of the QAM signal with points. In the
constellation, we take . The
transmitter filter gives a pulse having the square-root
raised-cosine spectrum with a rolloff factor. The desired symbol
is indexed by , and the CCI sources by (
for CCI).
The channel is assumed to be spatially independent flat
Rayleigh fading. The complex channel gain between the kth
transmit antenna and mth receive antenna for the desired signal
can be represented by , where is the
envelope with Rayleigh distribution having variance
. The complex channel gain between the ith CCI
source and mth receive antenna can be represented by
with variance . Phase and
have a uniform distribution in . With zero-mean
information symbols, the average power of the ith cochannel
interferer received by the mth diversity antenna is derived as
, where represents the data symbol
variance for all cochannel sources. For a M-QAM system,
. The input noise is a zero-mean
AWGN with two-sided power spectral density of W/Hz.
Thus, the noise power measured in the Nyquist band is .
The power of the transmit weight vector is restricted to be one
for the desired signal. Therefore, the average value of the SNR
on each diversity branch is defined by . Equal average
power is assumed for all received interferers, and therefore, we
set for . The signal-to-interference power
ratio (SIR) per diversity branch can be denoted by
.
At the receiver, we assume that the frequency and symbol
synchronization are perfect for the desired signal. As shown in
Fig. 1, after matching and sampling at , the signal
received at the mth diversity antenna is given by
(3)
where , the relative symbol timing offset between the desired
signal and the ith interferer, is assumed to be the same for each
diversity branch based on the principle of microscopic diversity;
pulse response having the raised-cosine spectrum is the
combined transmitter filter and receiver filter
which have the same response; the filtered noise is
and the power is calculated as
where denotes the convolution operation. Since noise is
wide stationary (WSS) and the power is independent of
sampling instance, we have . The signal
from the mth receive branch is weighted by a complex weight
. The output of the combiner has the form
. (4)
For convenience, the MIMO signal can be expressed in a matrix
form. The channel gain for the desired user can be defined as a
matrix
(5)
and the L cochannel interferers can be written in a matrix
form as
. (6)
The weight vector at the transmitter and the weight
vector at the receiver are defined as
with (i.e. average transmit power of the vector
is restricted to be constant) and ,
respectively, where is the transpose operator and
is the Euclidean norm. The output defined in Eq. (4) is
(7)
where , a vector, represents
ISI due to all interfering signals with
, which are the
truncated samples of the raised-cosine pulse due to the
delay offset from ith interferer, and
, which is the symbol
sequence of the ith interferer. The vector
represents R discrete
filtered noise sources at the receiver. The weight vectors and
can be determined using MRT and OT methods.
A. MRT weight for MIMO
In a MIMO system employing MRT scheme, signals are
combined in such a way that the overall output signal-to-noise
(SNR) of the system is maximized. Based on the Maximum-
ratio-combining (MRC) scheme, we have ,
where denotes the complex conjugate operation. It follows
that the SNR is given by

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS
We only exhibit the simulation results of 4-QAM with the
rolloff factor . A single dominant CCI and six
interferers are considered individually. The average value of
SIR is set to 10dB for simulation. In our test, the GQR method
can generate the same results by using the analytic method in
Eq. (18), when the channel is fixed. We first consider the
performance of Maximum-ratio-transmission (MRT), when the
precise CCI and Gaussian noise-like CCI models are employed.
When all channels are unfaded, Fig. 2 show plots of the bit error
probability (BER) versus average per diversity branch. In
general, for a given average , the transmit power in each of
antennas is smaller for , whereas the total combined noise
power at the receiver is higher for . Therefore, the effects
of these two factors compensate for each other which makes the
performance of bit error rate (BER) is symmetric in T and R in
the absence of CCI, as the results discussed in [10].
It is observed that the results obtained by using precise
interference model are considerably better than that obtained by
using the Gaussian model. Those curves appear different for L =
1, but they become close when L = 6 or R is higher. Based on a
central limit theorem, by increasing the number of interference
and number of receiver antennas, the precise interference model
can approach to the Gaussian model. Unlike the Gaussian CCI
case, we can see that using the precise CCI model results in
slightly better performance for . This is attributed to the
fact that fewer interfering signals received by antennas cause a
smaller degradation than Gaussian-like CCI. On the other hand,
the curves of BER using the Gaussian CCI and precise CCI
become close for system, since CCI received by several
antennas can be approached by Gaussian noise-like CCI.
When both the desired signal and CCI are subject to fading,
The results are exhibited in Fig. 3. The average BER becomes
very high, since fading effects increase the chance of taking on a
lower instantaneous SIR. The curves of the Gaussian CCI and
the precise CCI appear different with the increase of the
transmit and receive antennas, which reduces the fading effect
of the desired signal. The performance is slightly better for
, (e.g. T = 3 R = 2) when precise CCI model is used due to
the CCI characteristics. However, similar to the case with fading
CCI, the performance is better for (e.g. T = 2 R = 3) when
Gaussian CCI model is used. Therefore, the improvement
provided by the precise CCI model is evident when .
Because of fading CCI, the performance with L = 1 is worse
than that with L = 6. Moreover, we note that unlike the
nonfading case, the BER with (T, R) = (2, 2) is the lowest
compared to (T, R) = (3, 1) or (1,3).
Next, we consider the OT scheme and compare its results
with the MRT scheme in the MIMO system. The number of
receiver antennas must be greater than two in order to cancel
CCI. For the nonfading case, Fig. 4 shows that OT performs
worse than MRT due to significant noise enhancement under
certain channel conditions of CCI, while the MIMO intends to
cancel CCI. We find that the OT scheme is unable to show the
superiority over the MRT scheme for higher value of SIR (e.g.
SIR > 7dB), particularly when T > 1. The use of R = 3 can
improve the raised curve of BER for OT. In fact, the maximum
SINR is unable to guarantee the minimum BER, if the CCI is
not Gaussian distributed. The joint antenna weights, which are
derived for SINR maximization, is capable of minimizing the
total power of interference and noise, while the power of CCI is
reduced and the power of noise is enlarged. As a result, the BER
becomes relatively high, since CCI causes much less
impairment than the Gaussian noise given the same power.
Contrarily, the MRT scheme provides good CCI elimination
and achieve satisfied performance in this nonfading case.
When the desired signal and CCI are subject to fading, the
probability of low instantaneous SIR is considerably increased,
and then OT can demonstrate its superiority in cancelling CCI at
higher SNR. Fig. 5 shows that OT can improve the performance
significantly and outperform the MRT for L = 1 at high SNR.
Due to the noise enhancement effect, the performance of OT
with two antennas is much worse than that with three antennas,
given the a fixed number of antenna elements (e. g. T + R = 4)
between the transmitter and receiver. Unlike the MRT case, the
performance of OT with T = 2, R = 2 is worse than that with T =
1, R = 3 in the case of L = 1 due to noise enhancement.
However, the performance with T = 2, R = 2 is still better in the
case of L = 6, since CCI cannot be eliminated and has a similar
behavior to the MRT case.
V. CONCLUSION
The results of this study are expected to lead to a better
understanding of the effects of interference, and then to
optimize spectrum reuse and coverage in MIMO systems. We
successfully apply the Gaussian Quadrature rule (GQR) to
calculate the accurate probability of error in the presence of ISI
caused by cochannel interferers in the MIMO system based
MRT and OT schemes. The simulation results show that the
Gaussian interference model will become inaccurate for high
order of antennas in the MRT based MIMO system when the
desired signal and CCI suffer Rayleigh fading. Moreover, the
optimal technique using OT can offer performance gain at high
SNR under fading conditions when the number of interferers is
smaller. However, the OT scheme, in general, does not provide
significant performance improvement over the MRT scheme
when the number of interferers is large.

MMSE Space-Time Multiuser Decision-Feedback Detection in
Multiple-Antenna SDMA Systems over Dispersive Fading Channels
Abstract:
This paper analyzes the performance of space-time decision feedback equalization (STDFE) assisted
multiuser detection (MUD) for multiple-antenna space division multiple access (SDMA) systems to
improve system capacity over dispersive fading channels. The MUD-STDFE receiver consists of a
bank of matched filters and symbol-spaced feedforward filters (FFF) that both spatially and
temporally whitens noise and the precursive parts of multiple access interference (MAI), followed by a
bank of causal feedback filters (FBF) to cancel postcursive ISI and MAI for each user. The algorithm
for computing this multi-dimensional FFF and FBF coefficients is presented, based on minimum
meansquared error (MMSE) optimality criterion. The error probability is estimated accurately and
efficiently using the Gauss quadrature rule (GQR). The proposed MUD-STDFE receiver is capable of
improving the performance significantly, separating the users and offering a significant performance
gain relative to linear MMSEdetection in an SDMA system.
