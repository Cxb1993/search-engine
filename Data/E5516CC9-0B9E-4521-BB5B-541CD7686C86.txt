a result, in aquifers where gas exchange is limited, Hg(0) may remain dissolved and 
mobilized in groundwater to surface water bodies (Bone et al., 2007) or in drinking 
water distribution systems (Murphy et al., 1994; Barringer et al., 2006). 
Transport of Hg in groundwater is gaining increasing attention, as episodes of 
groundwater contamination with Hg, where Hg(0) can be supersaturated, have been 
reported worldwide (Murphy et al., 1994; NJDEP, 2001).  It has been suggested that 
microbial processes that reduce Hg(II) to Hg(0) in subsurface saturated sediments 
may contribute to this problem.  In New Jersey, USA, private wells with elevated Hg 
concentrations displayed increased concentrations of sodium, chloride, nitrate, and 
ammonia that originated from septic effluents (Barringer & Szabo, 2006; Barringer et 
al., 2006); in Kathmandu, elevated Hg concentrations in deep, non-rechargeable fossil 
groundwater were related to the degradation of biogenic dissolved organic carbon 
(Khatiwada et al., 2002).  These observations have raised a concern that in situ bio-
remedial action which conventionally relies on stimulation of indigenous microbial 
degradation or transformation of pollutants in contaminated subsurface sediments by 
providing external nutrients might inadvertently mobilize Hg into groundwater.  
Indeed, in nuclear legacy waste sites containing high concentrations of uranium and 
nitrate in Oak Ridge, TN, where previously a massive amount of Hg was used to 
separate lithium isotopes and currently bioremediation practices have been conducted 
(Vishnivetskaya et al., 2011), spikes of Hg concentrations were recorded in 
groundwater of a nearby watershed (http://public.ornl.gov/nabirfrc/frcsite3.cfm: GW-
835 in Area 2). 
Considering that nitrate often appears as a pollutant itself or a co-pollutant of 
groundwater in many contaminated sites that threaten drinking water resources 
(Rivett et al., 2008; Burow et al., 2010), laboratory studies of biological evolution of 
Hg(0) in dissimilatory nitrate-reducing enrichments derived from subsurface 
sediments were conducted in an effort to understand microbial Hg redox 
transformation that might occur under nitrate-reducing conditions in saturated zones.  
The goals of this project were as follows: (i) to examine nitrate-reducing subsurface 
enrichments for their ability to reduce Hg(II) in association with mer  activities, and 
(ii) to relate changes in the redox state of inorganic Hg to dissimilatory nitrate-
reducing activities. 
 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Establishment of subsurface-sediment nitrate-reducing enrichments.  The 
sediment inoculum for nitrate enrichments came from two sources.  The first batch of 
the sediment was obtained from the uncontaminated Background Area of the US 
Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge Integrated Field Research Challenge (OR-IFRC).  
The sediment cores (5.8 to 8.2 m below the surface) were recovered using sterilized 
drilling equipment from Borehole FB627, near field well FW301 on Nov. 16, 2005, 
aseptically sectioned under strictly anoxic conditions in an anaerobic chamber (Coy 
Labs, Grass Lake, MI), and had been stored anaerobically in gas-tight serum bottles 
ever since.  The second batch of the sediment was obtained from the NCU Lake using 
a manual-coring method (30 cm below the sediment surface) and also stored under the 
atmosphere of nitrogen in closed sedum bottles. 
A defined PIPES-buffered artificial groundwater (Pi-AGW) medium, 
constructed to simulate in situ groundwater chemistry using the principal chemical 
components revealed by the FW301 on-site monitoring well 
(http://public.ornl.gov/orifc/history.cfm?Location=%27FW301%27) proximal to the 
4 
 
was separated on a 1% agarose gel to check DNA concentration.  The concentration 
of DNA was determined by comparison to the intensity of bands in a  HindIII digest 
by image analysis.  Each PCR product (15 ng) was digested with MnlI for 6 h at 37°C.  
Digests were precipitated and fingerprinting was carried out on an ABI 310 genetic 
analyzer using Genescan software. 
Hg(II) reduction assay.  Experiments were prepared under strict anaerobic 
conditions in 60 mL acid-cleaned serum bottles in 25 mL bicarbonate-buffered AGW 
(Bi-AGW, pH 6.8) assay medium containing 20 mM sodium acetate and 10 mM 
potassium nitrate as electron donor and acceptor respectively, under a O2-free, 80% 
N2-20%CO2 gas stream.  Prior to conducting Hg(II) reduction experiments, the nitrate 
enrichment cultures were grown at 28°C in Pi-AGW amended with sodium acetate 
and potassium nitrate (10 mM each).  The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 
mid-log growth phase, resuspended in the Bi-AGW assay medium and served as the 
inoculum.  Exposure of the cells to air was minimized by the use of an anaerobic 
chamber with 95% N2-5% H2 atmosphere and the use of needles and gastight syringes, 
which were flushed with gas mixture of 80% N2-20% CO2, throughout the course of 
the experiment.  The inoculum was diluted 1:20 to a final cell density corresponding 
to OD660 of ~0.01 in foil-wrapped serum bottles containing assay medium, followed 
by a spike of Hg(II) (as HgCl2) to a final concentration of 1 μM at the start of the 
experiment.  Killed controls were obtained by heating an aliquot of the inoculum cells 
in sealed serum bottles for 30 min at 80°C.  All assays were incubated statically at 
28°C. 
At each time point, triplicate bottles were sacrificed for cell density (OD660), 
nitrate, nitrite, and Hg analyses.  Samples were purged with Hg-free N2 for 45 min to 
collect Hg(0) in a trapping solution consisting of 5% of concentrated sulfuric acid, 5% 
concentrated nitric acid, 0.74% potassium permanganate, and 0.4% potassium 
persulfate (USEPA, 1994).  Previous investigations have shown that 96-103% 
recovery of Hg(0) was obtained using this protocol.  Following purging, samples were 
withdrawn for OD (1 mL) and nitrate/nitrite (5 mL filtered through 0.2-μm syringe 
filters) measurements.  The trapping solutions were then added to the enrichment 
cultures to preserve the remaining non-purged Hg.  The samples were stored at 4°C 
for total Hg analysis. 
Abiotic Hg(0) oxidation assay.  To probe whether metabolites that were produced by 
growing enrichment converted Hg(0) to a non-purgeable form of Hg, abiotic Hg(0) 
oxidation assays using Hg(0) vapor and sterile filtrates of enrichment cultures, i.e., 
spent medium, were conducted.  Hg(0) vapor was obtained by pipetting droplets of 
liquid Hg(0) into empty serum bottles, which were sealed subsequently and allowed 
to equilibrate with the head space for 48 hours.  The spent medium was prepared by 
filtering (0.2-μm syringe filters) nitrate enrichment cultures that had not been exposed 
to Hg(II) at different growth stages into sealed serum bottles.  Using N2-flushed 
needles and syringes, equal volume of Hg(0) vapor was transferred from the 
headspace of serum bottles that had been saturated with liquid Hg(0) droplets to 
anaerobic spent medium.  Spent media obtained from enrichment at different growth 
stages were tested in triplicate.  Following incubation at 28°C for 24 hr in the dark, 
assayed bottles were processed in the same way as described above for the enrichment 
Hg(II) reduction experiments to collect and quantify how much of the added vapor-
phase Hg(0) was converted to non-purgeable Hg during the incubation and how much 
remained as Hg(0) in solution.  Fresh Bi-AGW medium was served as a control.

Ralstonia sp. and Bradyrhizobium sp.   The two new isolates were designated strains 
Ralstonia sp. NCU01 and Bradyrhizobium sp. FRC01.  Notably, bacterial strains 
belonging to these two genera have been previously documented as denitrifiers.   
The isolation of Bradyrhizobium sp. was also consistent with the result observed 
from TRFLP analysis, when the enrichments derived solely from the OR-IFRC 
sediments were subject to examine the effect of Hg on the composition of the 
denitrifying subsurface microbial communities.  For the TRFLP assay, the 
communities of the primary enrichment, untreated secondary enrichments, and of 
those treated with inorganic divalent Hg at 53 nM, 176 nM and 312 nM were 
analyzed.  Increasing concentration of Hg decreased the number of species in the 
enrichments as indicated by the number of major peaks in the TRFLP chromatogram 
(Fig. 1).  More than 14 such peaks were present in the primary enrichment, eight 
peaks in the untreated secondary enrichments, seven peaks in the enrichment with 53 
nM Hg, sic in the 176 nM Hg treatment, and only one single dominant peak remained 
in the enrichment with 312 nM Hg.  The sequenced PCR product of the 16S rRNA 
gene (27F-519R) from the 312 nM Hg enrichment had a 99% identity to that of an 
uncultured Bradyrhizobium sp. from sawfly larvae (Graham et al. 2008).  Further, a 
308 bp merA gene fragment was amplified with degenerate primer set 1 from the 
DNA extract of the 312 nM Hg treated enrichment.  The amino acid sequence 
deduced from the sequence of this PCR product was 92% identical to MerA of 
Pseudomonas sp. KHg3.  These results suggest that at 312 nM, a single merA 
containing denitrifier, most closely related to Bradyrhizobium spp., was selected in 
the OR-IFRC subsurface sediments.   
Since the strains Ralstonia sp. NCU01 and Bradyrhizobium sp. FRC01 were 
obtained in the presence of relatively high concentrations of HgCl2 (μM levels), they 
were tested for the existence of the merA gene.  PCR reactions with Bradyrhizobium 
sp. FRC01 (an Alphaproteobacterium) NDA produced a 1226 bp amplicon when 
amplified with degenerate primer set 3 (Fig. 2A) and a 308 bp amplicon with 
degenerate primer set 1.  Top BLASTX hits, performed using the 1226 bp amplicon 
as a query, were all annotated as MerA.  Several sequences recovered in this search 
showed 97% identity to the query, and represented MerAs obtained from a large 
group of Bacteria, including Betaproteobacteria (Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34), 
Gammaproteobacteria (P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter sp. 6013113, Salmonella enteric 
subsp, Shigella flexneri 5a Tn501, Proteus mirabilis) and Bacillus sp. KHg2 of the 
Firmicutes phylum.  It is noted that the sequence of the 308 bp amplicon from 
Bradyrhizobium sp. FRC01 was identical to that of the 308 bp amplicon obtained 
from the 312 nM HgCl2 treated nitrate enrichment.  Likewise, alignment of the 
enrichment 308 bp merA amplicon with that of the 1226 bp merA sequence obtained 
from the strain Bradyrhizobium sp. FRC01 was identical at the overlapping region 3’ 
end of merA.  This result suggests that the isolated pure culture of the strain FRC01 
represented the population that was enriched to dominance in the 312 nM HgCl2 
treated subsurface sediment nitrate enrichment (Fig. 1). 
The deduced amino acid sequence of the merA gene amplified from 
Bradyrhizobium sp. strain FRC01 with a high degree of sequence identity (97%) to 
MerA in a large group of bacteria including Gammaproteobacteria, 
Betaproteobacteria and Firmicutes suggested a cross class horizontal gene transfer 
(HGT) event.   In many organisms, the mer operon is located on plasmids and 
transposons (Barkay et al., 2010; Barkay et al., 2003), indicating the potential for 
spread by HGT.  Moreover, HGT has been previously implicated in the prevalence of 
mer (De Lipthay et al., 2008; Oregaard & Sørensen, 2007), and other metal-resistance 
8 
 
cultures (Fig. 6).  Also, nitrite was produced transiently, suggesting that nitrite was an 
intermediate product during the entire denitrification process of the cultures.  It is 
noted that while formation of gaseous Hg(0) was observed after overnight incubation, 
as revealed by an increase of Hg content in trapping solution, nitrate reduction and an 
increase in cell biomass did not follow Hg(II) reduction.  Given that all assayed 
bottles were wrapped with aluminum foil in the dark, the possibility of Hg(II) 
photochemical-reduction was ruled out.  Data from killed controls showing little 
changes in purgeable Hg (assuming in the form of elemental Hg) captured in trapping 
bottles and non-purgeable Hg (assuming in the form of divalent Hg) remained in 
assayed bottles also confirmed that reduction of Hg(II) indeed resulted from biotic 
reactions (Table 1).  Hg mass balance was examined by summing up the mass of 
purgeable Hg and non-purgeable Hg (Fig. 6 and Table 1). 
Barkay et al. (2010) have recently hypothesized that denitrification is the only 
anaerobic respiratory process that occurs at redox conditions high enough for 
inorganic Hg to exist as Hg(II).  The selection of strains that are resistant to Hg via 
the mer system under denitrifying conditions stated previously supports this 
hypothesis.  Acclimation to Hg, the enrichment of Hg resistant bacteria upon 
exposure to Hg and its role in restoring activities in Hg impacted communities, was 
previously documented in natural waters (Barkay, 1987) and soils (Rasmussen et al., 
2000).  Nonetheless, in our system a decrease in purgeable Hg and a simultaneously 
elevated Hg level in the cultures (i.e., in the assayed bottles) was surprisingly 
observed upon the onset of cell growth (Fig. 6 & 7), which was unexpected.   
Complexation between Hg(0) and reduced formed of natural dissolved organic 
matter (DOM), such as humic acid, would possibly result in this decrease of 
purgeable Hg (Gu et al., 2011).  However, it may not be the case in this study, due to 
the absence of humic substance-like compounds in our well chemistry-defined, 
relatively simple system (the only inputted organic matter was acetate, which was not 
a redox-active compound with less affinity for Hg).  Another plausible explanation for 
these observations is that Hg(0) may be re-oxidized to Hg(II), thereby resulting in the 
increase of non-purgeable Hg.  From a thermodynamic point of view, oxidation of 
Hg(0) by inorganic nitrogen compounds, such as nitrite, nitric oxide and nitrous oxide 
seemed to be favorable (Table 2).  Indeed, oxidation of U(IV) by heat-inactivated 
sediment slurries has been demonstrated in laboratory experiments, indicating that 
nitric oxide and nitrous oxide have the capacity of oxide uranium (from IV to VI) and 
mobilize uranium (Senko et al., 2002).  Further, using equilibrium geochemical 
modeling, speciation of Hg was predicted to be more stable in the form of Hg(II) 
under our experimental conditions (Fig. 8).  However, this did not necessarily reflect 
that formation of Hg(II) was resulted from the reactions of Hg(0) and these inorganic 
nitrogen compounds.  Regardless, the results pointed out that there might be a role for 
extracellular components, produced from the process of dissimilatory nitrate 
reduction, in the conversion of purgeable Hg to its non-purgeable form.  
Abiotic Hg(0) oxidation in the spent media of nitrate-reducing enrichments.  To 
probe whether the products of dissimilatory nitrate reduction were capable of 
converting Hg(0) to non-purgeable Hg (assuming as Hg(II)), abiotic Hg(0)-oxidation 
assays were conducted.  Results showed that compared to the assayed bottles that 
only included fresh medium, increases of Hg level were merely observed in the spent-
medium bottles, indicating that Hg(0) vapor might have been converted to non-
purgeable form of Hg, or oxidized to Hg(II), by extracellular compounds of 
enrichment cultures through non-enzymatic reactions (Fig. 9).  While the trend of 
non-purgeable Hg, or probably Hg(II), production was similar to that of nitrite 
10 
 
reduced Hg(II) to Hg(0).  While the production of Hg(0) by denitrifying enrichment 
cultures might increase the chance for the movement of Hg in aquifers, re-oxidization 
of Hg(0) (as indicated by the formation of non-purgeable Hg) in cultures was 
observed unexpectedly, which might limit the overall mobility of Hg in the subsurface 
environment yet increase the possibility of biological MeHg synthesis.  The 
mechanism involved in this oxidative transformation of Hg(0) is currently unclear; 
however, it is for sure resulted from pure abiotic reactions.  This dual role of 
microbial Hg-resistant, nitrate-reducing activities is expected to strongly influence the 
availability of reactive Hg and thus to have important implications for the uptake and 
methylation of Hg in anoxic environments. 
In addition to the determination of the true mechanism associated with coupled 
biotic/abiotic Hg(0) oxidation in the studied denitrifying consortium, examination of 
other nitrate-reducing bacteria is needed to ensure that this is an universal 
phenomenon shared in the denitrification process by those microbes.

一、參加會議經過 
第十屆「汞為全球性污染物」國際會議（ICMGP）於 2011年 7 月 24至

耶夫勒（Gävle, Sweden）舉辦第一屆後，該會議已成為與汞相關的科學研究
與環境政策等議題最重要的國際論壇。此系列會議每二至三年舉辦一次，且
地點通常選在曾經有過汞污染問題的城市，包括美國的蒙特略（Monterey, 
USA, 1992），加拿大的惠斯勒  （Whistler, Canada, 1994），德國的漢堡
（Hamburg, Germany, 1996），巴西的里約熱內盧（Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 1999），
日本的水俁市（Minamata, Japan, 2001）， 斯洛維尼亞的盧布爾雅那（Ljubljana, 
Slovenia, 2004），美國的麥迪遜（Madison, USA, 2006），以及中國大陸的貴
陽（Guiyang, China, 2009）。由於該會議每次的與會人士都在千人以上，且因
為汞研究所牽涉的範疇既廣且複雜，涵蓋的專業有毒理、生態、微生物、分
子生物、大氣、海洋、地質化學、公衛、水文與環境工程等等，所以對從事
汞研究的科學人員來說，此會議除了是個重要的論文發表並與交流學習的平
台外，也同時是個極佳的管道，提醒大家環境的問題是需要跨領域的合作才
能更完整的了解與掌控。 
本人上次（也是第一次）參加 2006 年在麥迪遜舉辦的第八屆會議時還
是個博士班的學生，對於首次見到名字屢屢出現在重要文獻上的大人物現身
會場時的興奮之情還記憶如新；也因為那次的會議，認識了許多在汞研究領
域的專家，包含了之後博士後研究的指導老師，所以收獲頗豐。此次會議由
於考慮到回台後尚未有機會與幾位國外的師長朋友們見面，加上目前的研究
結果部分有趣的現象與問題可藉由參加此會與同行的專家分享討論，同時本

發表。海報的部分安排在會議的第一天，整天下來，陸續有不少人前來觀看
討論並給予建議。由於我們在實驗中觀察到汞於模擬地下水厭氧環境中硝酸
鹽還原菌主導的狀態下，因微生物的生長代謝作用而進行氧化還原的循環反
應，這樣的實驗結果從文獻上查閱後尚未有類似的發現，所以總的來說引起
讀者極大的興趣，主要在於當汞的氧化還原態受改變後，將對汞在環境中的
傳輸與宿命的行為造成深遠的影響。前來觀看海報的當中一位，是赫赫有名
的前美國微生物協會的副理事長 Judy Wall 博士，也曾經是環境微生物領域
中最為重要的期刊之一「應用與環境微生物」（Applied and Environmental 
Microbiology）的總主編（Editor-in-Chief），其研究領域主要在於硫酸鹽還原
菌的生理代謝與此種菌群所引起的生物地化作用。Judy Wall 博士在看過及與
本人討論過後的反應極為正面，覺得這是很有意思的觀察結果，也給了許多
寶貴的建議，期許本人能在分子層次的機制上，再提供更為深入的佐證與討
論。 
口頭報告的部分則被安排在會議進行的第三上上午，此部分由本人博士
班時期的指導老師做報告。在報告中我們提出當汞甲基化純菌（以我們所篩
選出的硫酸鹽還原菌）以固定附著於表面的方式生長時（即一般所謂的生物
膜生長），對於汞甲基化的效率大為提升；而造成此現象的機制乃在於當此
類菌以生物膜型式生長時，期代謝途徑將不同於一般自由移動的生長方式
（即所謂的浮游生長）。我們觀察到此硫酸鹽還原菌從浮游型式轉變為生物
膜型式生長時，從原本不以 Acetyl-CoA pathway代謝碳屬化合物轉而主以此
代謝途徑進行生長，也進而以此方式將汞以更有效率的方式甲基化。由於報
告完時已達 15 分鐘，現場無法進行發問回答的程序，但會後有不少專注在
微生物汞化學形式轉化的著名研究學長來討論並提出日後一起合作的機會，
當中包括 USGS 的 Mark Marvin-DiPasquale博士，Smithsonian Environmental 
Research Center的Cindy Gilmour博士，以及University of Ottawa的Alexandre 
Poulain 博士。 
其他論文部分 
對於幾個本人有興趣的研究議題，在聽過口頭或海報發表後的心得總結
如下。穩定同位素在重金屬方面的應用，因為其特性可以做為類似法醫學的
推測與調查，近幾年受到極大的重視也蓬勃發展。幾場報告下來可知：汞的
穩定同位素可做為極為有用的工具，將以往大氣傳輸與沉降、地質礦物化性
變化、微生物胞內轉換反應等方面無法回答的問題逐一釐清。例如在大氣應
用上，汞的同位素的分率可以幫忙判定汞的來源是屬於長程、中程或短程傳
輸，以及沉降到土壤或水域環境時在微生物體內行何種生化反應，還原、氧
化、甲基化或是去甲基化。 
至於從有機質與汞之間的交互作用的議題可知雖然在有氧環境中汞主要
的親和配位基仍是含有還原態硫的有機質，在厭氧的環境中，依舊是硫化物
主宰汞的地化反應。另外，過去的研究雖指出在含有高濃度有機質的環境中，
汞的生物可利用性將大大地降低，但新的研究結果指出，微生物的生物活性
以及硫化物-有機質-汞三者之間的化學作用會因為有機質的形態、濃度、結
構等而改變，無法像之前的觀念只做簡單的判別。 
稻米中汞的量被發現比原先預估的還高，尤其是當農地位於汞排放源的
附近。更甚者，所有汞物種中毒性最高的甲基汞被注意到比其他型態的汞更
容易進入並累積在稻米米粒中，而非植物的其它部位。這結果引起本人極大
