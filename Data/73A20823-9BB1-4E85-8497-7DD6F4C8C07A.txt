by revolving a cam shaft.  The flow is defined as the diameter of the mortar. 
 
2.3 Drying Shrinking 
For the shrinking measurement, the prismatic specimens with the dimensions of 
25.3×25.3×284.6mm were prepared.  After demolding, the specimen was cured in 
water for 3 days, and then placed in a humidity cabinet at 23℃ and 70% RH until the 
age of 28 days.  Initial length of shrinkage specimens were measures before placing 
them into humidity cabinet.     
 
2.4 Compressive test 
Compressive strength tests were conducted in accordance to ASTM C 109-07 
[9] to evaluate the strength development of concrete containing various CFBC ash 
contents at the age of 7, 28 and 56 days.  In the study, river sand was partially 
replaced by particles of bed ash and the shape, texture, and distribution of particle size 
that are the most important factors affecting the strength of mortar.  Twenty 
φ 100x200mm cylindrical specimens were cast for each batch following the 
specifications of ASTM C 109. After 24-hour curing, the specimens were demolded 
and placed into a water tank at room temperature until tested. 
 
2.5 Penetrating test of Chloride ion 
The penetrating test of chloride ion in concrete was carried out by following 
ASTM C1202-07 [10].  For each mixture, six cylindrical specimens (φ 100×200 mm) 
were cast and moist-cured for 91 days.  Three 50 mm-thick samples were cut from 
each cylinder.  The ring surface of sample was epoxy-coated and then placed in a 
desiccator for vacuuming the pressure down to less than 1 torr.  After turn the pump 
off, the samples were soaked in de-aerated water for 18 hours.  Sodium hydroxide 
solution (0.3N NaOH) and sodium chloride solution (3% NaCl by mass) were poured 
in the chambers on both sides of concrete sample, where NaOH as the anode and 
NaCl as the cathode.  The set up of PCPT was illustrated in Fig. 1.  During the test, 
a voltage of 60V was applied continuously and the current was recorded the intervals 
with every 15 minutes for six-hour period long, and the total charge-passed was 
obtained by integrating the current vs. time curve.  
 
2.6 ISAT test 
The initial surface absorption test was carried out according to BS 1881 [11].  
The ISAT set-up is illustrated in Fig. 2.  Test specimen was a cylinder of 100mm (in 
diameter) and 50mm (in length) cylinder.  For the tests, the rate of absorption of 
water by the surface zone of the mortar samples is determined during a prescribed 
period under a head of 200mm of water.  The rate of initial surface absorption is 
expressed in ml/ml2/s.  
 
2.7 Resistance of Sulfate 
The tests of sulfate-immersion were performed by referring to ASTM C267-01 
[12], where evaluates the resistance of ash concretes of CFBC subjected to sulfate 
attack.  This might be resulted from seawater or contaminated ground water.  The 
expansion of volume for chemical reaction induces internal stresses, which may cause 
internal cracks and lead to failure eventually. The specimens were 50×50×50 mm 
cube which were cast and cured in water until tested.  After weight measurements, 
the specimens were immersed in saturated sulfate solution for 24 hours and then 
oven-dried at a constant temperature of 110±5  for another 24 hours. ℃  The previous 
3.4 CFBC ash effect on hydrated cement structure, permeability and chloride ion 
penetration   
Durability of structural concrete is mainly dependent on its permeation quality.  
Most often, durability of concrete is assessed through laboratory test, such as ISAT 
and RCPT test.  ISAT test results at intervals of 10, 30 and 60 min are shown in Fig. 
9 and Fig. 10.  This method provides three indices of permeation for classifying the 
durability in term of low, medium or high permeation/absorption.  According to 
Kumar [14], the durability of concrete can be classified in term of low, average or 
high permeability/absorption based on the value of measuring index of permeation.  
First, as the rate of ISA is higher than 0.2 ml/m2s at 60 minute, the permeation of 
concrete is high.  Second, when the rate of ISA is between 0.1 to 0.2 ml/m2s at 60 
minutes the permeation of concrete is medium.  Last, when the rate of ISA is lower 
than 0.1 ml/m2s at 60 minute, the permeation of concrete is low.  For mixes B, as 
additional content of CFBC was increased from 0 to 5%, the absorption slightly 
increased.  However, when additional content of CFBC was increased from 10 to 
20%, the absorption decreased with CFBC was adding into the mixture.  Such a 
decreased in absorption may be attributed to decreased pore structure within the mix 
due to the ettringite crystal formation.   
By the observation of SEM which indicates in Fig. 11(a). This illustrates no 
needle-shape ettringite (AFt) and capillary pores (0.01 to 10μm) in the Ordinary 
Portland Cement specimen.  But, a great number of needle-shape ettringite, 
plate-shape calcium hydroxide, and large pores were found in bed ash specimens of 
CFBC as shown in Fig. 11(b).  Sheng [3] have studied the hydration of cement paste 
with higher SO3 and f-CaO content would produce more C-S-H and AFt in hydration 
products, which can decrease the water flow and ionic diffusion occur.  The rate of 
ISA for all mixes in this study is higher than 0.4 ml/m2s, the ash of CFBC does not 
improve the resistance of liquid penetration.  For mixture A, contained lower cement 
content because the replacement of cement by bed ash of CFBC, which resulted in 
lower strength and higher water absorption.  As the rate of ISA verse compressive 
strength plots for mixes A and B at 60 min are showing in Fig. 12.  From Figure 12., 
where the trend line is perfectly fitting between all the data points.  Which shows the 
linear equation of relationship between the rate of ISA and compressive strength is 
y=-0.0162x+1.2244, with the coefficient of 0.87.     
The ASTM C1202 standard test method for electrical indication of concrete’s 
ability to resist chloride ion penetration monitors the amount of electrical current that 
is passed through a cylindrical concrete specimen when a 60V DC is applied across 
the specimen for a period of 6h.  Five levels are identified to classified the charge as 
corresponding to chloride ion penetrability of High (>4000 Coulombs), moderate 
(2000-4000 Coulombs), Low (1000-2000 Coulombs), Very Low (100-1000 
Coulombs), Negligible (<100 Coulombs).  The charge obtained for all mixtures are 
exceed 4000 coulombs and the temperature are raised above 90℃ within 6 hr test 
period, then stop testing.  Feldman et al. [15] made some valuable comparisons 
between results of alternating current method and ASTM C1202, and gave good 
corrosion relations between initial current and total charge for a period of 6h.  Initial 
current for all mixtures are listed in Table 3.  For each data, two specimens are used, 
and the result is decided by average values.  A linear fitting is made with the initial 
current and the cement content, with a great correlation coefficient is 0.97 that shows 
in Figure 13.  From Table 3 indicates there is an increasing in initial current with an 
increasing in replacement of bed ash for sand.  This also leads to increase in 
compressive strength and decrease in initial surface absorption rate as depicted in Fig.
