temperature and heat flux on the remaining boundary. 
Besides, Lesnic et al. [25] also extended the results of 
[26] for solving the IHCP when no boundary condition 
is prescribed and used the BEM to find the solution 
numerically. In addition, Al-Najem et al. [27] 
employed the singular value decomposition (SVD) 
with BEM and the least-squares approach with integral 
transform method to deal with two-dimensional 
steady-state IHCPs. Shen [28] even employed two 
BEMs, a collocation method and a weighted one, to 
solve the IHCP. Moreover, Singh and Tanaka [29] also 
presented an application of the dual reciprocity 
boundary element method (DRBEM) in conjunction 
with iterative regularization for the solution of 
time-dependent IHCPs. Based on the dual reciprocity 
boundary element along with sequential function 
specification scheme, Behbahani-nia and Kowsary [30] 
have recently proposed a method to deal with 
two-dimensional IHCPs involving unknown time and 
space varying boundary heat flux estimation. Since 
there is no need on domain discretization in the BEM, 
the location of interior points, in which the temperature 
data are gathered, can be selected in a rather arbitrary 
way [31]. It should be noted that Ochiai and Sladek [32] 
have recently proposed a numerical treatment of 
domain integrals in three-dimensional boundary 
integral formulations which is without the need to 
discretize the interior of the domain especially for 
thermal stress analysis with arbitrary internal heat 
generation. Comparing with those mesh-dependent 
methods like FEM and BEM, the meshless methods 
[33, 34], which do not require any domain or boundary 
discretization, have been proposed. In general, 
applications of the BEM in this field decreases the 
computational time and capacity requirement but the 
problem of numerical stability still exists. 
  In this report, we propose a new numerical scheme 
for solving the sideways heat equation. Based on the 
numerical method of line, which is also a 
well-developed numerical method, the proposed 
scheme can transform the partial differential equation 
into a system of ordinary differential equations. The 
major contributions made in this paper are the applying 
of group preserving property of the resultant system in 
developing an effective numerical scheme and giving a 
persuasion that the proposed scheme is superior to the 
Euler scheme and the fourth-order Runge-Kutta 
method even it requires calculating an adaptive factor. 
More importantly, the proposed scheme is easy to 
implement and time saving. Through this study, we can 
have an easy-implementation and explicit-single step 
group preserving scheme (GPS) used in the 
calculations of the sideways heat equation. The 
accuracy of the proposed scheme is much better than 
the Euler scheme, and it may over the fourth-order 
Runge-Kutta method. 
 
3. Inverse problem statement  
In many industrial applications we may want to 
determine the temperature on the surface of a body, but 
the surface itself is inaccessible for a measurement. It 
may also be the case that locating a measurement 
device on the surface would disturb the measurements 
so that an incorrect temperature is recorded. In such 
cases one is restricted to internal measurements. 
Berntsson [35] has presented an example of an 
industrial application where the sideways heat equation 
can be used. He has considered a particle board, on 
which a thin lacquer coating is to be applied. In order 
to reduce the time for the lacquer coating to dry, we 
initially heat the particle board. Since the temperature 
gradients on and close to the surface of the board 
influence the drying time and the quality of the lacquer 
coating, it is important to estimate the temperature and 
the temperature gradients on the surface of the board. It 
is usually difficult or impossible to measure the 
temperature directly on the surface of the board, 
instead, we can drill a hole from the other side of the 
board and place a thermocouple close to the surface to 
measure the temperature. 
  The sideways heat equation is a model of a situation 
that when the temperature data from a measurement 
device located inside a body is available, we attempt to 
decide the outside temperature of the body. Here we 
are concerned with the numerical solutions of 
,0     0,           , ≥≥≥= txuu xxt lν               (1) 
with a left-side boundary condition: 
,0     ),()(0, ≥= tttu α                         (2) 
and initial condition: 
0,          ),(h,0)( ≥≥= xxxu l    (3) 
in which ν is the thermal conductivity of a 
heat-conducting rod with length l. 
  When it is impossible to measure the temperature on 
the surface directly, the sideways heat equation often 
occurs in engineering appliances, in which one wants 
to resolve the surface temperature from measurements 
inside a heat-conducting object. The problem setup 
with its physical model is shown in Fig. 1. Suppose 
that we can insert a thermocouple inside the rod to 
measure the temperature at a position x = a < l, and the 
data is denoted by 
.0     ),(),( ≥= tttau β                         (4) 
The inverse problem is thus to decide the temperature 
field inside the rod by using Eqs. (1)-(4). 
  When we want to recover the temperature on the 
other side at x = l, we can use the solution of the above 
problem. However, this problem is ill-posed in the 
sense that the solution does not depend continuously on 
the data given or measured. Therefore, we first 
transform Eq. (1) to the following equations:

t
txu
x
txv
txv
x
txu

Then, by using a semi-discretized method to discretize 
the quantities of u(x, t) and v(x, t) along the time 
direction, we can obtain a system of ordinary 
differential equations for u and v with x as independent 
variable. In order to integrate these differential 
equations, let us first briefly sketch the so-called 
group-preserving scheme developed by Liu [36] for 
ordinary differential equations in the next section.

  In order to assess the accuracy of our numerical 
method, let us consider the following point-wise 
numerical error: 
,,,    ,,,1,   ,)Δ ,Δ(:Error nijutixju ij KK 10 ==−= N   (21) 
of which  is a numerical solution at the i-th time 
step and at the j-th grid point; u(jΔx, iΔt) is a 
corresponding exact solution and 
i
ju
 denotes the 
absolute value. 
We apply the computational schemes to this example 
by letting Δx = 10-3 m, Δt = 0.02 sec, and a = 0.2, 0.5, 
0.9 m. The numerical errors being the differences of 
numerical solutions and exact solutions are plotted in 
Fig. 3 for GPS, Euler and RK4 with two different 
thermal conductivities of ν = 1, 1.5 W/mK. The errors 
for GPS are slightly smaller than that of Euler and RK4 
in a partial range. 
Furthermore, we make a comparison of the 
numerical errors of GPS, Euler and RK4 schemes in 
Tables 1 and 2 for three values of a = 0.2, 0.5, 0.9 m 
with ν = 1, 1.5 W/mK and for different grid spacing 
lengths and time step sizes. The errors are defined by 
the absolute values of the differences of numerical 
solutions to the exact solution u(1, t) = 1 at x = 1 and t 
= 0.3 sec. From Table 1, it can be seen that the errors of 
GPS are less than those of the Euler and RK4 schemes 
for all cases. As can been seen, the errors of the Euler 
scheme are reduced when the time step sizes decrease 
or when the grid spacing lengths decrease. However, 
the errors of GPS are reduced when the grid spacing 
length increase and time step sizes decrease. But these 
are not true for RK4. 
Next, we compare the numerical errors of GPS and 
RK4 schemes in Tables 3 and 4 with Δx = 10-3 m, Δt = 
0.02 sec, a = 0.2, 0.5 m and ν = 1, 1.5 W/mK at three 
different times of t = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 sec for three different 
grid points of x = 0.6, 0.8, 1. When a = 0.9 m, we 
compare the errors at three different grid points of x = 
0.91, 0.95, 1. It can be seen that for most of the data, 
GPS is more accurate than RK4. Only in the case of a 
= 0.9 m at three different grid points of x = 0.91, 0.95, 
1, these three schemes are almost given results equal to 
the exact solutions. 
Then, let us consider the following global error:

In Tables 5 and 6, we compare the global errors of GPS, 
Euler and RK4 with Δt = 0.02 sec, a = 0.2, 0.5, 0.9 m 
and ν = 1, 1.5 W/mK. The errors of GPS are smaller 
than those of RK4 when a = 0.2, 0.5 m. 
  In a practical use, we usually mount a thermocouple 
as far away from the surface as possible for not 
destroying the structure of the engineering appliance 
too much, which means that a is much smaller than 1. 
In this sense the point-wise and global errors of GPS 
are much smaller than that of Euler and RK4 schemes, 
which in turns greatly suggest us to use the GPS in 
these calculations of sideways heat equation when a is 
limited to be small for a safety reason. 
  In the cases of the input data contaminated by 
random noises, we are concerned with the robustness 
of our numerical schemes. We use the function 
RANDOM_NUMBER given in Fortran to generate the 
noisy data R(i), in which R(i) are random numbers in 
[0, 1]. The numerical errors of GPS with random noise 
effect in the range of [0, 0.01] obtained from R(i) by 
multiplying a factor 10-2, those of GPS with random 
noise effect on the initial condition, and those without 
random noise effect are plotted in Figs. 4(a)-(b), (e)-(f), 
and (i)-(j), respectively, for GPS at x = 1, a = 0.2, 0.5, 
0.9 m and ν = 1, 1.5 W/mK. As can be seen, the 
random noise affects the numerical results very little. 
The numerical errors of GPS with random noise effect 
in the range of [0, 0.01], those on the initial condition, 
and those without random noise effect are plotted in 
Figs. 4(c)-(d), (g)-(h), and (k)-(l), respectively, for GPS 
at t = 0.04 sec, a = 0.2, 0.5, 0.9 m and ν = 1, 1.5 W/mK. 
As shown in these figures, the random noise affects the 
numerical results obviously only at the rear portion of 
the rod when a = 0.2 and 0.5 m. For a = 0.9 m, the 
random noise gives no influence on the numerical 
results. Then we imposed the random noise in the 
range of [0, 0.001] on the boundary data at a = 0.2, 0.5, 
0.9 m with ν = 1, 1.5 W/mK. The numerical errors of 
GPS with random noise effect in the range of [0, 0.001], 
those with random noise effect on the boundary data 
and those without random noise effect are plotted in 
Fig. 5. Even under the disturbance of random noise, 
our scheme is still performing very well. 
 
7. Conclusions 
  The inverse heat conduction problems have been 
well calculated by the formulation with a 
semi-discretization of the time coordinate of sideways 
heat equation in conjunction with the group preserving 
numerical integration scheme along the spatial 
direction. In the inverse numerical integration of the 
sideways heat equation, a simple employment of the 
finite difference, finite element, boundary element or 
meshless method may result in numerical instablility.
