2I. INTRODUCTION
Wireless technology enables people to access information just about anywhere anytime.
Among the deployment of wireless infrastructures, the IEEE 802.11 [1] is the most popular
wireless technology in wireless local area network (WLAN).
The fast growth in multimedia traffic over wireless channels makes it crucial to guarantee
the most critical parameters, bit rate and delay, in applications with video and audio streams.
This is commonly known as the quality of service (QoS).
The original IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol does not provide QoS guarantee. In order to
support the capability of QoS guarantee the IEEE 802.11 Task Group E has defined
enhancements to the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol, as in IEEE 802.11e draft [2].
As shown in figure 1, in IEEE 802.11e, a new MAC layer function called the hybrid
coordination function (HCF) is proposed.HCF defines two medium access methods: a
contention-based channel access referred to as enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA),
and a controlled (contention-free) channel access referred to as HCF controlled channel access
(HCCA).
EDCA does provide QoS support, but the operating parameters can not be adapted to
network conditions. This has a detrimental effect on network performance: when a collision
occurs, another collision is very likely to occur in the next frame, especially when the traffic
load is high.
The adaptive EDCF (AEDCF) is proposed to adapt EDCA parameters to network
conditions [3].AEDCF uses the probability of collision as an estimate of network conditions to
adjust the competitive parameters. However, when there are many stations contending for the
channel simultaneously, the high collision rate is still unavoidable [4]. In such a scenario,
reducing the number of contending stations is critical to lower the collision rate.
In this project, we propose a novel MAC-layer admission control mechanism called SCAS,
the self conscious congestion avoidance scheme. The basic idea is that when the collision rate is
high, we temporarily stop some stations in contending for the channel.
The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In Section II, we give a brief review
of the operative mechanisms in IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.11e. In Section III, we introduce the
proposed SCAS. SCAS is evaluated by simulation experiments, and the results are described in
Section IV. We draw conclusions in Section V.

6In EDCA, the transmission procedure is divided into two steps.
1) Each frame in an AC contends with other ACs in the same QSTA. A virtual collision occurs
when two or more ACs finish the backoff procedure at the same time. In that case, the higher
priority AC wins and goes to the next step. The lower priority AC remains and contends
again.
2) The winner contends with ACs of other QSTAs. The CSMA/CA technology is used to
resolve the competition issues.
Although EDCA provides QoS support, its competitive parameters is not adapted to network
conditions. As a result, if the collision occurs, a high probability of collision occurs in
subsequent time slots, especially when the traffic load is high. To adapt the competitive
parameters of EDCA to network conditions, an adaptive EDCF (AEDCF) is proposed [3].
AEDCF uses the probability of collision to estimate network conditions and adapts the
competitive parameters. Specifically, AEDCF works as below:
 After a successful transmission, CW is set by the following steps.
8(Contention-Free Poll) frame to poll the QSTAs whether they have frames to transmit and a
QoS CF-End (Contention-Free End) frame to announce the end of CFP (contention-free period).
The transmission time of each QSTA is controlled by HCCA TXOP which is announced by the
QAP. Unlike PCF, HCCA not only operates in CFPs but also in CPs (contention periods).
Figure 3 illustrates HCCA.
There are schemes proposed to improve QoS in IEEE 802.11 WLAN by modifying the
HCCA. In [20], each QSTA is given a new queue to make different priority flows be allocated
TXOP fairly. In [21], in order to improve the throughput of VBR, FHCF scheme (Fair HCF) is
proposed. FHCF uses an estimated queue size and the ideal queue size to estimate the next
TXOP. In [22], a feedback scheme according to the queue sizes is proposed to improve the QoS
in HCCA.

collision rate is high, the traffic load is high. Facing a high collision rate, an STA would
temporarily stop contending with other STAs until the collision rate reduces.
SCAS is on the MAC layer. Hence it can be applied both to the IEEE 802.11e medium
access method (EDCA [2]) and to AEDCF [3]. Besides, SCAS is distributed, so each STA can
operate SCAS by itself, not through AP or a higher layer.
A. Basic Ideas and Parameters
According to the definition of IEEE 802.11e, we divide the medium access time of STA
during a CP into two phases, the internal contention phase and the external contention phase.
The internal contention phase is used to decide which frame of ACs in the STA is selected to be
transmitted. The four ACs in an STA contend in this phase first and the winner will enter the
external contention phase. If a collision occurs during the contention procedure, the
higher-priority AC wins and enter the external contention phase. The lower-priority AC stays in
the internal contention phase and participates in the next competition. The external contention
phase is used to decide which STAs gets to transmit frame. If a collision occurs
during the contention procedure, the STAs stay in the external contention phase and participate
in the next competition.
We divide the external contention phase into two states, the contention state and the
waiting state. We implement the admission control scheme via these two states. When in the
contention state, an STA contends with other STAs. When in the waiting state, an STA stops
contending with other STAs.
We define the following parameters used in the state transition procedure.
 CF (changing factor) is used in a low-priority flow to identify the current stage. Its initial
value is 0 and is reset to 0 after the successful transmission of STA.
 QT is the queuing time of a frame waiting to be transmitted.
 CRavg is the average collision ratio of the network.
 TH_CR is a threshold for the collision ratio.
 WN is the cumulative number of waiting periods in the waiting state.
 TH_WN is a threshold for WN.
 LPR (low-priority ratio) is used to represent the ratio of low-priority flow.
 TH_LPR is a threshold for LPR.
 LifeTime is the life time of a frame.
Each STA estimates the network condition during a period of T estimate. The parameter
CRavg is estimated by
12
B. High-Priority Flow
When an STA enters the external contention phase with a high-priority traffic flow, it
performs the state transition between contention and waiting states according to the parameters
CRavg, TH_CR, QT and LifeTime. This is illustrated in Figure 6.
With a high-priority flow we not only use CRavg but also consider the time constraint for
state transition. While in the waiting state, if CRavg ≤ TH_CR or QT > 1/2 LifeTime, then the
STA transits to the contention state to contend for channel use. Otherwise, it still stays in the
Waiting State. While in the contention state, if CRavg> TH_CR and QT ≤ 1/2 LifeTime, then the
STA transits to the waiting state and temporarily stops contending for channel use. Otherwise, it
stays in the contention state. Figure 7 and Figure 8 illustrate these points.
14
Here we allow the low-priority flows contending with high-priority flows when the
average collision ratio of the network CRavg is less than or equal to the threshold of collision
ratio TH_ CR. Besides, when the low-priority flows have waited longer than the threshold of
waiting periods TH_WN, we allow the low-priority flows to contend for transmission as long as
the the ratio of low-priority flows LPR is not exceeding the threshold of low-priority flows
TH_LPR. The use of both TH_WN and TH_LPR ensure that the low-priority flows would not
encounter either the problem of starvation or the problem of occupying more than their shares of
transmission periods.

IV. EXPERIMENTS
We test the performance of SCAS on two medium access methods, EDCA and AEDCF,
during contention periods by simulations.
A. Simulation environment and parameter
We use NS-2 (Network simulator version 2) [23] as our simulator and adopt the extended
tool of EDCA which is released by TKN [24] to support our proposed SCAS. Figure 12 shows
the network topology of simulation. Each QSTA has three traffic flows and transmit them to the
common destination QAP. The three traffic flows are voice, video and background according to
priority. The transmission time of each traffic flow in each STA is random. The voice flow has
the highest priority, followed by the video, followed by the background. Here, we use the
number of STAs to represent the load of the channel.
The traffic flows use CBR/UDP method to transmit. Table III shows the parameter values.

AEDCF and SCAS-AE. AEDCF improve the in-time throughput of the voice and video flows
by SCAS.
Figure 23 shows the average throughput of background flow between EDCA and SCAS-E.
Figure 24 shows the average throughput of background flow between AEDCF and SCAS-AE.
From Figure 23 and Figure 24 we could know the average throughput of background flow in
SCAS would decrease when the STAs increase. But SCAS is still better than EDCA and
AEDCF.
Figure 25 and Figure 26 compares the average throughputs in EDCA and SCAS-E. Here
we can see that SCAS improves the average throughput of a system in EDCA and AEDCF,
especially in high traffic load.

V. SUMMARY
Each STA obtains the opportunity of medium access by contending with each other during
contention period in the IEEE 802.11e. Therefore, when many STAs contend for the channel at
the same time, the increase in collision rate leads to degradation of the system performance,
especially in high traffic load conditions. To maintain the QoS and improve the system
performance, we propose a simple MAC layer admission control mechanism SCAS based on
the idea of congestion avoidance. During the contention period, we adaptively stop some STAs
contending for the channel temporarily to reduce the collision rate according to the network
conditions.
Simulation results of various priority traffic flows show that SCAS not only reduces
collision rate of EDCA and AEDCF efficiently but also improves mean delay time and system
throughput.
