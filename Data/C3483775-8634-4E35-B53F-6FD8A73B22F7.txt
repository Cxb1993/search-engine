the external power should be activated. To 
generate the walking motion, the actuators 
are servo-controlled to make all joints follow 
a set of reference trajectories which are 
planned in advanced based on desired 
walking pattern and stability considerations 
[1]. Regardless of the fact that powered 
walkers can produce dexterous and 
human-like motions, these systems often 
consume excessive power. Take the 
humanoid robot P3 [2] for example, its 
power consumption during walking is 
approximately 20 times the power 
consumption of a human of the same size. 
On the other hand, the passive bipedal 
walkers, as proposed firstly by McGeer [3], 
demand neither external power nor active 
control. Their motion is solely the result of 
interaction between gravity and the passive 
dynamics of the walker itself. Although 
passive walkers consume absolutely zero 
power, their stability and reliability are 
usually the main concerns. For instance, the 
passive walker developed by Collins et al. [4] 
still has a failure rate of more than 20%. 
Moreover, the walking is limited on a slope. 
In this research, we intend to integrate 
the merits of both the powered and passive 
bipedal walkers by developing a semi-active 
bipedal walker from the viewpoint of energy 
and natural dynamics. In the past, some 
researches have addressed the dynamics and 
control issues of bipedal walkers from 
similar viewpoints. For example, Van der 
Linde [5] added springs and dampers at ankle 
and hip joints, and by varying the associated 
coefficients of the springs and dampers, 
power pulses were produced to propel the 
walker. Jerry E. Pratt [6] utilized inherent 
robustness and natural dynamics of human 
walking to simplify the control algorithm and 
enhance the stability. Collins et al.[7] 
presented three bipedal walkers based on 
passive-dynamics with some active power 
sources added to walk on level ground. 
The work in this paper is motivated by 
Tai-Chi, the ancient Chinese martial art. In 
the Tai-Chi exercise, the practitioner has to 
learn to actuate only part of his/her muscles 
to control the motion of the center of gravity 
(COG) and relax the rest of muscles. The 
muscles in relaxing state behave like passive 
springs which can transmit the COG motion 
to the extremities so as to induce a total-body, 
fluidic movement. The proposed semi-active 
bipedal walker imitates the Tai-Chi gait in a 
way that during most of a walking cycle, 
only half of the joints are actuated to control 
the COG's motion trajectory, and the other 
half remain unactuated but have passive 
springs connected between adjacent links. 
Since the motion for the unactuated joints are 
dictated by the coupling between the COG 
motion and the passive dynamics, one can 
expect that a smoother, more natural-looking 
movement can be resulted. 
 
2 Energy Analysis of the Bipedal 
Walker 
 
Assuming that the bipedal walker performs 
stable and periodic walking on a level ground, 
then during each walking cycle, the principle 
of energy conservation can be written in the 
following form:  
0  lostW W E+ −= − −Δ  (1)
where W+  and W−  are respectively the 
positive work and the negative work done by 
the actuators, and lostEΔ  denotes the 
energy loss due to friction and impact. The 
right side of the equation equals zero because

in actuation will be referred to as the active 
leg, and the leg in relaxation will be referred 
to as the passive leg. 
 
3.1 Reference COG Trajectory 
 
Based on how a Tai-Chi practitioner 
manipulates his/her COG to move forward, a 
reference trajectory for the COG is planned. 
The trajectory is qualitatively shown in 
Fig.figesiredCG with the same XYZ  
coordinates in Fig. 2. Basically, the trajectory 
consists of two phases: the descending phase 
and the transiting phase. In Fig.1, the 
descending phase starts at point " "a  where 
the COG is located exactly on the top of the 
right foot and both feet are parallel. The 
active (right) leg and its associated actuators 
are controlled to make the COG descend 
vertically to " "b  . During the descending, 
not only all three pitch springs in the active 
leg are compressed, because the pelvis link is 
controlled to remain level, but all the pitch 
springs in the passive leg are also 
compressed. It will be proved in the next 
section that once the springs in the passive 
leg are compressed enough to break the 
ground friction on the left sole, the passive 
leg slides forward and the pitch springs on it 
become relaxed or even stretched. Therefore, 
it is assumed that at " "b  the left leg has 
already slid forward and become the front leg. 
In this descending phase depicted in Fig.3 (a), 
actuators in the active leg perform mostly 
positive work retrieved in the springs in the 
active leg to descend the COG, and seldom 
negative work to finely tune the COG 
trajectory. At the same time, no electric 
power is consumed for actuators in the 
passive leg.

Figure 2. The desired trajectory of COG. 
In the transiting phase, the COG follows 
the path of b -c -d -e  and arrives on top of 
the left foot. In this phase, the active control 
gradually transits from the right leg to the left 
one, so at the end of this phase the left (front) 
leg becomes active and the right (rear) one 
becomes passive. Moreover, to carry the 
COG forward, the potential energy stored by 
the passive springs of the right leg during the 
descending phase has to first transform into 
kinetic energy and then back to potential 
energy. To make the COG motion 
compatible with such energy transformations 
so that the actuation can be kept to minimum, 
the b - c - d - e  path is chosen to be a 
2nd-order, parabolic-like trajectory. In Fig.3, 
the transiting trajectory slightly deviates 
from a perfect parabola in the way that as 
COG approaches " "d  , a small overshoot is 
added to make the COG first go beyond and 
then come back to the center of the left foot. 
This overshoot is used to stretch the joint 
springs in the right leg so that enough pulling 
force can be generated to break ground 
friction on the right sole. As a result, the 
right leg is brought forward and both feet

thus the differential displacements p  y

p J qδ δ=  (3)
where J  is the Jacobian matrix. Assume 
that the actuators in the active leg 
equivalently produce a force vector

equilibrium, the principal of virtual work 
yields

substituting the differential relation in (3) 
into the above equation, F  can be 
determined as:

Assume that the Jacobian matrix J  is 
nonsingular. Again by equilibrium, the 
normal force and the friction force that the 
ground exerts on the sole of the passive leg 
are respectively zF−  and yF . When the leg 
is about to slide, yF  has to reach the 
maximum static friction s zFμ− , where sμ  
is the coefficient of static friction. Using (5), 
such a sliding condition can be written 
explicitly as

Equation (6) determines the posture of the 
passive leg when it is about to slide. Given 
q1  and q2  satisfying (6), the 
corresponding hip position [ ]Ty z  can be 
obtained by solving (2). This hip position 
also corresponds to COG's threshold location 
that makes the passive leg slide. Since both 
(2) and (6) are nonlinear, algebraic equations, 
it is difficult to derive an analytic-form of 
[ ]Ty z  that meets the sliding condition. For 
the purpose of illustration, the threshold 
COG locations are solved numerically for the 
model with 0.2sμ = , 1 2 0.1l l= = , 
1 0.01k = , 2 0.05k = , and two linear 
springs with 1 10.01( 85 )qτ = − − D , 
2 20.05( 80 )qτ = − − D . (The constitutive 
relations indicate that the springs are relaxed 
at 85D  and 80D  respectively.) According 
to the numerical solutions in Fig.4 (a), the 
COG's threshold locations in the possible 
operating region can be divided into two 
separate curves which can provide useful 
guidelines for planning the reference COG 
trajectory. For instance, assuming that 
initially the COG is located at [ ]0 0.199 T , 
the left curve implies that, to make the 
passive leg slide in the descending phase, 
rather than moving COG directly downward 
as discussed previously, one also have to add 
a slight backward motion to the reference 
trajectory. Moreover, the right curve shows 
how COG should move forward relative to 
the rear foot in order to make the rear 
(passive) leg slide forward during the COG's 
 8
For purpose of designing the reference 
trajectory for COG, selecting the PD gains, 
as well as designing the constitutive relation 
for each of the passive spring, a 3D computer 
model of the walker is constructed using the 
software ADAMS. The software allows one 
to construct a virtual prototype which can be 
used to simultaneously simulate the dynamic 
interactions among the mechanism, the 
actuators, and the controls. After several 
trials and errors, the walker is successfully 
designed. The control gains 500PK = , 
1DK =  are adopted for the joint controller 
at knee and 200PK = , 0.05DK =  are 
adopted for the rest of the joint controllers. 
The associated passive spring constants and 
relaxed angles are listed in Table 2.

The reference trajectory for the COG, 
the PD gains, and the springs' constitutive 
relations in simulations are directly adopted 
in the hardware implementation. Fig.7 shows 
the consecutive snapshots of the actual 
walker during three walking cycles. The 
experimental video demonstration can be 
found in

W.wmv. In Fig. 8, the reference trajectory 
and the actual COG trajectory are plotted 
together for comparison. The actual 
trajectory roughly conforms to the reference 
one except during part of the descending 
phase where uncertain frictional effect plays 
a dominating role. The walker is able to walk 
smoothly with 1.5  seconds per step and 
step length 7.5cm. Moreover, due to the 
semi-active nature, during 83.33%  of the 
walking cycle only one leg is actuated and 
the other remains passive.
