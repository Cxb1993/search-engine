Abstract 
The spectral responses of conventional cameras are derived from the ITU-R BT.709 color standard 
so that the cameras are able to record the signals that are suitable for the display to reproduce image 
color. However the ideal spectral responses derived from the ITU-R BT.709 color standard are not 
physically realizable. They are modified so that camera spectral responses can be practically 
implemented. The chromaticity calibration of practical cameras is not very accurate because of the large 
side lobes of the ideal spectral responses. A method to design a camera that is able to record more 
accurate image color is shown. It is found that the amplitudes of side lobes of derived ideal spectral 
responses from a wide-color-gamut display with monochromatic primaries can be significantly reduced. 
The camera with practical spectral responses modified from ideal spectral responses is chromatically 
calibration with GretagMacbeth ColorChecker. The result shows that the chromaticity calibration error 
can be reduced accordingly. Although the camera spectral responses are derived from a 
wide-color-gamut display, it also can be applied to the displays with less saturated primaries, e.g. ITU-R 
BT.709 primaries. Because the derived ideal spectral responses depend on the wavelengths of 
monochromatic primaries, we may choose proper primary wavelengths to derive suitable spectral 
responses for available dye materials used in the color filters of the cameras with high-color-accuracy 
recording capability.

reproducing image color. However, as is shown in Fig. 3, there are negative side lobes for the ideal 
spectral responses. Although camera spectral response is non-negative, we can apply a 3×3 matrix to the 
camera raw signals for calibration so that the camera output signals (Rc, Gc, Bc) can be applied to an 
ITU-R BT.709 standard display for reproducing image color. We take the red channel as an example to 
explain the calibration method. A set of hypothetical spectral responses of positive value is shown in Fig. 
3 with dashed lines. It is noticed that the wavelengths of peak hypothetical spectral responses are 
slightly shifted from the corresponding ideal spectral responses, respectively, and the relative peak 
amplitude of the hypothetical spectral responses are also slightly different from that of the ideal spectral 
responses for minimizing the error of the calibration method shown in the following. For the ideal 
spectral response of red channel shown in Fig. 3, there are a positive side lobe in blue region and a 
negative side lobe in green region. The calibration matrix is equivalent to taking the hypothetical 
spectral response of blue channel as the positive side lobe of the ideal spectral response of red channel in 
blue region and taking the inverted hypothetical spectral response of green channel as the negative side 
lobe of the ideal spectral response of red channel in green region. In mathematical expression, Rc= crrRd 
-crgGd + crbBd, where crr, crg and cgb are positive values and they can be calculated by regression. The 
training samples for regression can be prepared with preferred color charts, e.g. GretagMacbeth 
ColorChecker. The calibration methods for green and blue channels are similar. Such a calibration 
method is widely used in either video camera or digital still camera (DSC) today. However, the 
calibration method is not very accurate even if high order terms are included in regression mainly 
because the practical spectral responses of blue and green channels much differ from the positive side 
lobe in blue region and the negative side lobe in green region of the ideal spectral response of red 
channel, so are for green and blue channels. 
In this paper, we propose a method to design a camera that is able to record more accurate color 
image. The basic idea is to reduce the amplitudes of side lobes of derived ideal spectral responses so that

in the last section, the tristimulus values and camera raw signals are not linearly related for physically 
realizable spectral responses due to the side lobes of the ideal spectral responses and limited available 
absorption materials for color filters. We assume a set of hypothetical spectral responses for studying the 
calibration error due to the mismatches between the physically realizable spectral responses and ideal 
spectral responses. The hypothetical spectral responses are

green and blue channels, respectively. 
    Tristimulus values and camera raw signals can be empirically related with the following equations

3. Design Method and Result 
There are 24 color patches in GretagMacbeth ColorChecker. The spectral reflectance of each color 
patch is measured. The product of the measured reflectance and the spectral power density of D65 
illuminant is taken as the spectral power density ( )S λ , in which the brightness of D65 illuminant is set 
so that its stimulus value Y is unit. The calculated spectral power density is called the normalized 
spectral power density. The tristimulus values of training samples are calculated from Eq.(4) with 
normalized spectral power densities. The calculated tristimulus values are called the target tristimulus 
values. The camera raw signals are calculated from Eq.(3) with the normalized spectral power densities 
and the hypothetical spectral responses given by Eq.(6). Because there are only 24 color patches with 
GretagMacbeth ColorChecker, we take P=2 and Q=1 so that the degree of freedoms M= 21 and is less 
than 24. The color difference between the tristimulus values predicted by Eq.(7) and target tristimulus 
values of a color patch is calculated with CIEDE2000 [8]. The parameters rλΔ , gλΔ  and bλΔ  in 
Eq.(6) are optimized for the minimum average color difference of the 24 color patches. 
The optimized hypothetical spectral responses derived from ITU-R BT.709 color standard are shown 
in Fig. 3 with dashed lines. We can see that the spectral response of red channel is shifted to shorter 
wavelength and its peak amplitude is significantly increased; the spectral response of green channel is 
slightly shifted to longer wavelength; the spectral response of blue channel is slightly shifted to shorter 
wavelength and its peak amplitude is slightly increased. The target and predicted color coordinates of 24 
training color patches are shown in Fig. 4. The average color difference 00EΔ = 0.45. 
We take the WCG display with monochromatic primaries given in [12] as an example to show the 
improvement of calibration error by deriving the camera responses from its primaries. The primary 
wavelengths are 607 nm, 520 nm and 455 nm for red, green and blue primaries, respectively. Figure 5 
shows the ideal spectral responses derived from the WCG display. We can see that the amplitudes of side

二、與會心得 
1. 由這幾年參與 SID 會議的觀察，韓日的平面顯示器產業界與學術界的表現消長很明顯。韓國越來越
壯大，而日本的影響力則是越來越弱。台灣的學術界還很努力，但產業界則每況愈下。 
 
2. 以往 Samsung 便很能善用國際上各國的研究資源，今年年初 Samsung 更透過 SID 廣發英雄帖，目的
在透過 SID 這個平台，建立全世界研發人員的資料庫，並對外委託研究計畫。由這些件事可以看出
身為產業霸主的 Samsung，不只是有韓國政府的支持而能致之。十年前，韓國顯示器產業遠不如台
灣，更不必說與日本相比，現今回首不禁令人噓唏。在當代自由貿易與保護智慧財產的世界，注重
研發才是王道。 
 
3. 由於具有明顯節能的效益，韓國廠商 SKC 對於本人今年所發表論文很感興趣，未來可以有實際應用

三、建議事項 
1. 鑑於上述與會心得，台灣產官學界應設法投入更多資源於顯示器技術開發，並加強彼此之間的合作。 
 
2. 本人在會議報告論文中所提出的紅藍綠三色子像素不等面積的設計概念，值得國內相關業者參考。
