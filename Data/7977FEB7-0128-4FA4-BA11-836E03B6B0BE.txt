Abstract. Traditional e-commerce is limited because it cannot provide enough direct information about 
products to online consumers. Online shoppers might be unsatisfied with products and the related customer 
service they receive because of the lack of interaction which onsite shopping can provide. In this study, an 
augmented reality (AR) e-commerce system based on user-centered design principles was developed. The 
tool was developed as an Internet plug-in, so it can be used on different kinds of computers and handheld 
devices. A usability study was also conducted to compare the AR e-commerce system with traditional 
e-commerce and desktop virtual reality (VR) e-commerce systems. Study results show that the AR 
e-commerce system provided more information and more direct experiences to online customers by 
combining physical environment information with virtual product models. As a result, the AR system can help 
customers make better purchasing decisions.

then send the video tape to interested customers by email. Their method of using AR in e-commerce did not 
make full use of the advantages of AR. With only video recordings of AR scenes, customers still might not 
know whether products were suitable for them in their real physical environments. 
Two industry companies, Metaio and Bitmanagement (http://www.ar-live.de/main.php), are cooperating 
on a project aimed at extending e-commerce systems with AR technology. With their system, users are asked 
to upload a photo of their personal environment, with markers placed where they would like to see products. 
They then create a mixed scene which can be visualized with their online tool. However, simply placing a 
virtual model on a scene generated from a static picture greatly limits users to directly interact with virtual 
product models in a natural way and to try the products flexibly in their actual environment.  
In this study, a new AR e-commerce system was developed. The developed system integrates a virtual 
product model into an online shopper’s physical environment and provides methods by which the customer 
can “realistically” interact with the virtual product. Online shoppers can use the system to freely and directly 
interact with the product model in their environment in a more natural way. For example, they can physically 
walk around the virtual model to see, from any viewpoint, how the product fits in their personal environment. 
They can also move products by moving markers. 
2   System and User Interface Design  
2.1   Structure 
Like traditional e-commerce systems, our AR e-commerce system uses the Internet as the primary user 
interaction platform. However, with our AR e-commerce system, a camera is needed to capture the 
consumer’s physical environment and then integrate it with virtual objects.  
The system was developed as an Active X plug-in for an e-commerce web page. Online users can use 
web page navigation to search for and view pictures and product related information, just as they would on a 
traditional e-commerce website. However, online shoppers can also use the plug-in to bring virtual products 
into their physical environment and then interact with the products to determine if the products are suitable. 
The plug-in was made using the MFC and OpenGL libraries. The plug-in works between clients and an 
e-commerce assistant server through an Internet Explorer interface. As a result, online shoppers can easily log 
into the Internet website from a computer, cell phone, or PDAs. ARToolkit is used for tracking, and Open 
VRML is used for rendering models. The complete structure of the system is shown in Figure 1.

3   Usability Study  
A usability study was conducted to compare our enhanced AR e-commerce system with a traditional 
e-commerce system and a desktop VR e-commerce system. To avoid web page design bias, all three web 
pages were designed using the same design template, which included a word description of the product and a 
visualization of the product, as shown in Figures 6-8. The word description parts of the three e-commerce web 
pages were the same. The only difference among the three types of e-commerce systems was in the 
visualization component.

The experiment was designed as a within-subject study for types of e-commerce, so that each subject 
could try all three e-commerce systems. Since subjects inevitably differ from each other, in between-subject 
designs differences among subjects are uncontrollable and are therefore treated as error. In within-subject 
designs, the same subjects are tested under each condition. Therefore, differences among subjects can be 
measured and separated from error. Removing variance due to differences between subjects from error 
variance greatly increases the power of significance. As a result, the study was designed as a within-subject 
experiment for comparing users’ subjective satisfaction levels when using the three different types of 
e-commerce systems. Therefore, variations in the participant’s rating standards should not affect comparisons.  
The experiment was conducted in four different office locations, which included four different office 
types (an open space office, a cubical, a single-user single-room office, and a multi-user single-room shared 
office). Tests were carried out with six volunteer participants in each of the four office locations. In total, 
twenty-four participants were tested in the experiment. Participants were asked to use the three types of 
e-commerce system to buy different office products without considering their budget. Users were asked to 
select wall hangings and decorative plants and then compare the three types of e-commerce systems. During 
the experiment, the users’ shopping processes were recorded and observed. After the experiment, participants 
were asked to fill out a questionnaire and to give their evaluations of usability. 
Four main variables (overall evaluation, information provided, ease of use, and confidence level in their 
final decision) were measured for each type of e-commerce system and for each participant. In the study, the 
independent variables were the three different types of e-commerce systems and four different locations. 
Within each location, presentation order of the e-commerce systems was systematically varied to control the 
“carryover” effects of a within-subject design. Since six subjects were assigned to each location, we were able 
to test all possible presentation orders of the three ecommerce systems (3 choose 1 * 2 choose 1 * 1 choose 1) 
= 6. There were four main dependent variables in the research questions: overall evaluation, information 
provided, ease of use, and confidence level in the final decision.  
To test whether the usability results were affected by experience order, the six participants in each of the 
four locations were randomly assigned to one of the six orders. Evaluations of the four main variables were 
also compared for the different orders. The formal study addressed the following hypotheses: 
Hypothesis 1: Users’ overall evaluation and satisfaction level when using the AR e-commerce system 
will be higher than the other two e-commerce systems.  Because users of our system can do more 
interactions with products, for example, see them from different view points or move them to a specific 
place by moving the marker, we believe that the overall evaluation level of our AR e-commerce system 
will be the highest. 
Hypothesis 2: The AR e-commerce system will provide more product information to online shoppers 
than the other two e-commerce systems.  Because users of our AR e-commerce system can integrate 
virtual models on real environments to see how the products look rather than can only see products in 
the computer, we consider our AR e-commerce system will provide more information. 
Hypothesis 3: The ease of use rating for the AR e-commerce system will be lower than the other two 
e-commerce systems.  Unlike the traditional and VR e-commerce systems, which are better known by 
most people who have experiences of shopping online, our AR e-commerce system is relative not 
common, so we assume the ease of use rating of our system will be lower than the other two. 
Hypothesis 4: Users of AR e-commerce system will have a higher confidence level in their final decision 
10 
 
e-commerce, and 4.583 for AR enhanced e-commerce. The test effects analysis is shown in Table 2. The 
p-value for the effect of the type of e-commerce system is very small (<0.05), which indicates that there is a 
statistically significant difference in mean overall evaluations between the three types of e-commerce systems. 
In contrast, the p-value for the effect of location is 0.7913, which indicates that there is no statistically 
significant difference in mean overall evaluations for different locations.

3.3.2   Product Information Provided 
In the questionnaire, users were asked to rate how much product information they gained from the three 
different types of e-commerce systems, and the exact question is “Please evaluate the product information 
(e.g., color, size, fit your office or not, etc) provided by the three e-Commerce web pages on a scale from 
lowest (1) to highest (5)”. Participants’ ratings for information provided are listed in Table 4.

was 4.021, and for the AR enhanced e-commerce system was 3.479. As shown in the effects test analysis in 
Table 8, the p-value for the effect of type of e-commerce system is 0.0027 (<0.05), which indicates that there 
is a statistically significant difference in mean ease of use between the three types of e-commerce systems. In 
contrast, the p-value for the effect of location is 0.4033, which indicates that there is no statistically significant 
difference in mean ease of use for different locations.  
Figure 13 shows the main effect of different types of e-commerce systems. Ease of use for the AR 
e-commerce system is much lower than that for the traditional and for the VR e-commerce systems. The 
p-value for the interaction effect between type and location is 0.5186, which indicate that there are also no 
statistically significant interaction effects for type and location. Thus, the interaction effects for ease of use 
were neglected in the refined analysis model shown in Table 9. 
To determine the differences between ease of use for the three types of e-commerce systems, Tukey 
HSD was used, without considering location or order. With an experiment-wise error rate of 0.05, Table 9 
shows that the difference in ease of use between the traditional e-commerce system and the VR e-commerce 
system is not statistically significant. The difference between the VR e-commerce system and the AR enhance 
e-commerce system is also not statistically significant. However, ease of use for the traditional e-commerce 
system is significantly better than ease of use for the AR enhanced e-commerce system. Thus, research 
hypothesis 3 was accepted.  
Participants commented that the AR e-commerce system needed more high-end hardware equipment, 
and that it was inconvenient to use. For example, “It is inconvenient to hold a laptop all the time.” However, 
users’ computer behaviors also affected the rating. Most users were not familiar with AR and AR interaction. 
Meanwhile, there was also no statistically significant evidence showing that location had an effect on ease of 
use. 
3.3.4   User Confidence Level for Decision 
The final main dependent variable measured in the questionnaire was the user’s confidence level in their 
decision. Participants’ ratings are listed in Table 10, by location and by experience order, which were also 
tested using Factorial ANOVA, and the exact question is “Please rate your confidence level for your decision 
(e.g., buy or not), based on the information given by each of the three e-Commerce web pages, on a scale 
from lowest (1) to highest (5)”. 
The mean user confidence level for the traditional e-commerce system was 2.25, for the VR 
e-commerce system was 3.542, and for the AR enhanced e-commerce system was 4.646. As shown in Table 
11, the p-value for the effect of type of e-commerce system is very small (<0.05), which indicates that there is 
a statistically significant difference in user confidence level between the three types of e-commerce systems. 
However, the p-value of the effect of location is 0.1184, which indicates that there is no statistically 
significant difference in user confidence level for different locations. 
Figures 14 shows the main effect for different types. User confidence level for the AR e-commerce is 
much higher than user confidence level for either the traditional or the VR e-commerce systems. The p-value 
for the interaction effect of type and location is 0.3923, which indicate that there is no statistically significant 
interaction effect for type and location, Thus, location effect, and interaction effects on user confidence level 
were neglected in the refined analysis model as shown in Table 12.

To determine the differences in user confidence level for the three types of e-commerce systems, Tukey 
HSD was used, without considering location or order. With an experiment-wise error rate of 0.05, Table 12 
shows that the difference in user confidence level between the AR e-commerce system and both the traditional 
e-commerce system and the VR e-commerce system was statistically significant.  
The results show that users had a higher confidence level in their shopping decisions when using the AR 
enhanced e-commerce system rather than the other two for purchasing office decoration products. Thus, 
research hypothesis 4 was accepted. AR e-commerce makes shopping more “intuitive”. “The user naturally 
sees what will happen before actually buying”. “It gives you a real-time experience in your own environment 
so that you can instantly tell whether or not the product is a good fit”. Meanwhile, there was also no 
statistically significant evidence that location had an effect on user confidence level.  
3.4 Observations and Users’ Comments 
3.4.1 “As Is” View 
95.8% of participants mentioned in their feedback that the AR e-commerce system provides the 
capability to see how products fit in the physical space. Users’ comments included: It is “visually intuitive”.

markers are partially occluded, methods for partial marker tracking need to be developed. Although wireless 
Internet access is currently still not fast enough for transferring high-resolution product models in real-time, it 
is not considered to be a significant problem, since further technology enhancements should take place in the 
near future.

2. PRIOR DEVICES 
There are two types of tactile haptic devices: grounded devices and ungrounded devices. A grounded device 
has a fixed base. An ungrounded device is usually glove-based. Ungrounded devices are generally more 
natural, intuitive, and easy to use than grounded devices. Ungrounded devices also allow more freedom of 
movement than grounded devices. However, ungrounded devices are generally more limited, in capability and 
performance, than grounded devices.   
The most well-known and commonly used haptic device is a grounded device from Sensable Technologies [4]. 
The device is composed of linkage mechanisms and DC motors. Users interact with the device by moving a 
hand-held stylus. The device is not very natural, intuitive, or easy to use. The device restricts freedom of 
movement. The device also has a limited bandwidth. Therefore, the device can provide force, shape, or 
stiffness feedback. However, the device cannot generate high frequency vibrations.. 
Other devices can generate high frequency vibrations. For example, Uchiyama et al. [5] used disk motors and 
a baseball glove to guide a semi-autonomous wheelchair. The device used high-frequency pulse patterns to 
transmit directions and warning signals to users. The study showed that disk motors can generate high 
frequency vibrations that can transmit information to a user's hand. However, the study did not use vibrations 
for tactile sensing.  
Other studies used vibrations for tactile sensing. For example, Pabon et al [6] developed a tactile haptic glove 
that used optical sensors and disk vibration motors for stiffness sensing. They varied waveform type and 
amplitude to control vibration intensity for different stiffness values. However, the study did not create 
realistic vibrations for texture sensing.  
Other studies used vibrations for texture sensing. For example, Romano et al [7] developed a SlipGlove 
device that used optical sensors and disk vibration motors to detect finger motion and generate vibrations for 
texture sensing. They used a simple proportional relationship between sliding speed and actuator voltage to 
create stronger, higher frequency vibrations for faster finger motions. However, the study did not create 
realistic vibrations that matched actual surface texture sensations. 
Other studies tried to create more realistic vibrations. For example, Hashimoto et al [8] developed a 
free-standing tactile display that used high performance, low resolution speakers and wide bandwidth 
composite waveforms, and negative and positive air pressure forces to create vibrations for surface texture 
sensing. The study showed that voice coil actuators are more versatile than vibration motors. However, the 
display limits user mobility, and the speakers limit vibration force, frequency, and resolution. 
Other studies have used pneumatic actuators to improve resolution. Makino et al [9] discovered that human 
skin is not sensitive to force direction (negative or positive). As a result, they developed a large-area tactile 
display that used pneumatic actuators, with pulling forces, to create high resolution sensations for contacts 
ranging from sharp edges to smooth surfaces. However, the actuators can only create static or low-frequency 
sensations.

4.2. Surface texture perception 
Coarse texture perception depends upon spatial cues: feature size, shape, density, and position. Fine texture 
perception depends upon temporal cues: vibrations normal to the skin surface [17-19]. However, texture 
perception also depends upon friction forces [20].  
An ideal tactile haptic device should use both vibrations and friction forces. However, this study focuses on 
developing a portable haptic device that can create realistic vibrations from actual surface textures. Future 
studies will consider friction forces.  
Based upon skin sensing capabilities and surface texture perception principles, the device must create 
complex, realistic 40-200 Hz vibrations, normal to the skin surface. 
4.3. Vibro-tactile stimulation 
To create realistic vibrations, a tactile haptic device must measure actual surface textures and convert the 
measurements into realistic vibrations. 
In prior studies, various techniques have been used to measure surface textures or generate vibrations. 
However, most studies did not achieve both tasks. Those that achieved both tasks did not achieve the level of 
performance needed.  
Okamura et al. [21] used a stylus to measure surface textures for sandpapers and patterned surfaces. The 
measured signals were complex waveforms with many frequency components (Figure 2).

4.4. Device theory 
This study introduces a new tactile haptic device that can create realistic vibrations from actual surface 
textures, in real time. The study also presents a new design approach for creating the tactile haptic device. 
The approach uses signal synthesis and linear filtering techniques to model tactile haptic device elements. The 
approach is similar to an approach Wightman and Kistler [25] used to model headphone sound system

The tactile haptic device simulates vibrations measured from actual surface textures. For a physical vibration 
V, the device uses a vibration sensor to transform the vibration into an electrical signal X1  
X1 = VTSI1 (1) 
where TS is the transfer function of the vibration sensor, and I1 is a transfer function that represents sensor 
installation on the sensed surface. The model includes I1 because sensor installation may affect X1, even when 
V and TS do not change.  
To simulate V, the device uses a device controller to convert X1 into an electrical signal Y1 and sends Y1 to an 
actuator. The actuator creates a vibration, which the vibration sensor converts to an electrical signal X2  
X2 = Y1TATSI2 (2) 
where TA is the transfer function of the actuator, and I2 is a transfer function that represents sensor installation 
on the actuator.  
To simulate V, Y1 must be found. Ideally, V = Y1TA, which indicates that the actuator vibration must match the 
surface texture vibration. However, V is unknown. Instead, Y1 can be found by setting X1 = X2, which indicates 
that the sensor signals for the two vibrations must match. From, Equations 1 and 2,  
VTSI1 = Y1TATSI2 (3) 
V = Y1TA ( I2  / I1 ) (4) 
Equation 4 shows that V  = Y1TA when I1 = I2 and X1 = X2. As a result, the sensor should always be installed 
in the same way on the actual surface and the actuator. Assuming that the condition can be met, and 
substituting Equation 4 into Equation 1,  
X1 = Y1TATSI2 (5) 
Y1 = X1 ( TATSI2 ) −1 (6) 
The actuator stimulus signal Y1 can be generated by multiplying the original surface texture sensor signal X1 
by the combined transfer function ( TATSI2 ) −1. In this study, a neural network (NN) was used to estimate the 
combined transfer function.  
Since X1 = X2, NN training data was generated by sending a training signal Y1 to the device actuator, 
measuring the corresponding response signal X2, and sampling both signals. From Equations 2 and 6 
( Y1 )i = ( X2 )i TNN (7) 
where TNN is the transfer function of the neural network, and i = 1, 2, …, n, for n signal samples.

The components are small, light, and cost effective. The sensor has a 10-180 Hz frequency response. The 
micro-speaker has a 40 mm outer diameter. As a result, the speaker can be used generate vibrations on a user’s 
fingertip. The speaker has a very wide 50 Hz – 20 kHz frequency response. Speaker amplitude and frequency 
are also independent [28]. 
5.2. Training data 
To collect training data, a 0.2 grams plastic contactor was attached to the sensor. Adding mass increases 
sensor sensitivity but reduces maximum frequency. Reducing the free-length of the sensor increases 
maximum frequency [26]. To reduce the free-length of the sensor, the sensor was mounted on an acrylic box. 
The contactor was placed on the diaphragm of the speaker, as shown in Figure 7.  
A function generator and a DC power supply were used to drive the micro-speaker with sine, square, triangle, 
ramp, and noise signals. An oscilloscope was used to measure the speaker input and the corresponding sensor 
output.

3. Use the normalized input vectors and the NN to compute predicted output vectors. The path from input, 
through the NN, to the predicted output represents Step 3.  
4. Calculate errors between the real outputs and the predicted outputs.  
5. If the errors are large, update the NN and go to Step 3; if the errors are small, stop the training process.  
A MLP NN has an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer. The input layer receives input vectors. The 
output layer delivers results. The hidden layers convert input vectors to corresponding output vectors. The 
number of nodes (neurons) in the input and output layers must match the number of data points in the input 
and output vectors. 
To reduce complexity, 25 neural networks were used to compute 10 output values for each 250-element input 
vector. As a result, each NN had an input layer with 250 nodes, an output layer with 10 nodes, and one hidden 
layer with the same number of nodes (10) as the output layer. All nodes were fully-connected.  
Figure 12 shows the internal structure of a single neuron j in layer ℓ of the NN. The Xℓ-1,i values represent the 
n-dimensional input vector of the neuron. If the previous layer (ℓ-1) is the input layer, the Xℓ-1,i values 
represent the input vector ( X1 )i of the NN. Otherwise, they are output values from the n neurons in the 
previous layer. If the current layer ℓ is the output layer, the Xℓ,j values represent the output vector ( Y1 )j of the 
NN.  
Each link has a weight Wℓ,i,j. Therefore, the net input of the neuron (vℓ,j) is the weighted sum of the Xℓ-1,i values, 
plus a bias θℓ,j

The NN was trained, using back propagation, steepest descent approximations, and over-fitting controls [34]. 
To complete one training epoch, the training process modified each weight once for each training vector. The 
training process ran for 400 epochs or until training error was minimized.

The measured surface textures were comparable to those from prior studies (Figures 16, 2, and [21]). 
However, the device used a NN controller to convert measured textures into more realistic actuator input 
signals that considered sensor, actuator, and sensor installation effects (Figure 3 and [22-24]). As a result, the 
actuator output vibrations matched original surface textures better than those from prior studies (Figures 17, 4, 
and [24]). 
Figures 14-15 show that speaker vibrations did not match surface textures very closely, in the time domain. 
Figures 16-17 show that speaker vibrations did match original surface textures closely, in the frequency 
domain. Linear filtering was used to derive the NN controller function. Therefore, the results were expected. 
The results show that the device can create realistic vibrations from actual surface textures. The vibrations 
match original surface textures closely, in the frequency domain. Fine texture perception depends upon 
vibration frequency [18, 19, 23].  As a result, the study successfully developed a new tactile haptic device for 
glove-based augmented reality.

Fine surface texture perception depends upon vibrations normal to the skin surface. As a result, the device 
uses a vibration sensor, controller, and actuator to measure actual surface textures and convert the 
measurements into realistic vibrations normal to the skin surface.  
The device can be built with different sensors and actuators. However, the sensor must detect 40-200 Hz 
vibrations, the actuator must create similar vibrations, and the sensor must be mounted in the same way, on 
both the actuator and actual surfaces. The device model is based upon linear filtering and open-loop control 
principles. Therefore, non-linearities and noise effects must also be considered.  
In this study, a piezo-polymer film sensor, a neural network (NN) controller, and a micro-speaker were used to 
create a prototype device. To collect NN training data, the sensor was attached to the speaker, the speaker was 
driven with sine, square, triangle, ramp, and noise signals, and normalized data was derived from the 
measured sensor signals. The NN was trained using back propagation, steepest descent approximations, and 
over-fitting controls. NN output matched training signals with 95% accuracy. 
After training, the device was used to create vibrations from actual surface textures. The sensor was used to 
measure vibrations from three sandpaper disks, NN output was used to drive the speaker, and the sensor was 
used to measure speaker vibrations.  
Measured surface textures were comparable to those from prior studies. However, the device used a NN 
controller to convert measured textures into more realistic actuator input signals that considered sensor, 
actuator, and sensor installation effects. As a result, the actuator produced vibrations that matched actual 
surface textures closely, in the frequency domain. 
The results showed that the device can create realistic vibrations from actual surface textures, in real time. As 
a result, the study successfully developed a new tactile haptic device for glove-based augmented reality.  
In future work, user tests will be completed, more surface textures will be tested, the device will be mounted 
in a tactile haptic glove, and the glove will be used to make VR systems more realistic and effective for 
applications such as engineering design and virtual prototyping.

1. Purpose 
The purpose of attending the Going Green – CARE INNOVATION 2010 
conference was to present my research results and learn more advanced 
technologies in the areas of energy-efficient products and services. In 
addition, it was also a very excellent venue to meet many professionals in 
both sustainable development and green product designs.  
2. Process 
CARE is the acronym of Comprehensive Approach for the Resource and 
Energy-efficiency. The theme of the conference was to provide a platform 
to discuss how the electronics and other innovative industries, science and 
politics approach the global environmental and social challenges. The 
conference was held at the beautiful Schoenbrunn Palace at Vienna, Austria. 
A picture of the conference site is shown below. 
There were 33 sessions, organized in 4 parallel streams, where the 
attendances delivered over 170 presentations. There were also four tutorial 
sessions.

The topic of my presentation was “Optimizing Product Configurations for 
Green Product Design”. The main objective of this paper was to optimize 
product configurations for better disassembly. This paper proposed a 
redesign method for simplifying a selective disassembly sequence for the 
ease of disassembling a target component. Designers can use the method to 
analyze, redesign, and optimize an existing or a new product design to 
simplify the steps needed to remove a target component or a module. 
3. Conclusion 
During this trip, I learned a lot of new technologies and applications in the 
areas of sustainable design. I also learned how industries implement green 
concepts in their businesses. Although green-related research has been 
promoted for awhile, more efficient and cost-effective methods are still 
needed. This was a very fruitful experiences.
