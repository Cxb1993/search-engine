thickness of the soft layer
7, 19-21
. 
The interaction between coercivity and soft layer thickness is quite different in different studies. 
 
The purpose of the study: 
(1) 
This study discusses the formation of (001) preferred orientation in FePt film on a glass substrate by RTA. 
Further, the current work uses the Ag capped layer and seed layer to study ordering temperature effect in FePt 
film. This research analyzes microstructures of FePt, Ag/FePt and Ag/FePt/Ag films to know the grains size 
and distribution after high temperature recrystallization.  
(2) 
This work discusses Fe soft layer thickness on the properties of exchange-spring Fe/FePt bilayer. The 
influence of Fe soft layer thicknesses on the out-of-plane coercivity (Hc) are discussed by the two spin model 
for rigid magnetic film. The magnetization reversal of exchange-spring like film was interpreted by domain 
wall motion. 
 
Experimental: 
(1) 
The FePt single layer, Ag/FePt bilayer and Ag/FePt/Ag trilayer were fabricated by DC magnetron 
sputtering. The thickness of FePt film was fixed at 10nm. The capped Ag layer was fixed at 1 nm and seed 
layer was 0.1nm or 0.9nm. The base pressure of the sputtering system was 2x10
-8
 Torr and the working 
pressure was 3x10
-3
 Torr under high purity Argon gas. The FePt alloy target was used and the films were 
deposited on the glass substrate (Corning 1737). After deposition, the films were annealed by using rapid 
thermal annealing (RTA) system at the temperature from 400
o
C to 800
o
C in vacuum for 5 minutes. 
The crystal structure of the films was examined by a grazing incident x-ray diffractometry (XRD, MAC 
Sience, MXP 18) with Cu K radiation (=0.1541nm). The microstructure of the films was observed by high 
resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL2010). Magnetic hysteresis loops were measured 
at room temperature by using vibration sample magnetometer (VSM, Lakeshore7400) with the maximum 
magnetic field of 1.8T.  
 
(2) 
  The Fe (x nm)/FePt (10nm) (x= 2-20 nm) bilayer were fabricated with DC magnetron sputtering. The 
base pressure of the sputtering system was 2x10
-8
 Torr and the working pressure was 1.5x10
-3
 Torr under high 
purity argon gas. The FePt alloy target was used and the films were deposited on a glass substrate. The film 
chemical composition is Fe56Pt44 measured by energy dispersive spectrometers (EDS). After deposition, the 
films were annealed by a rapid thermal process (RTP) at 800
o
C for 10 minutes. Fe layers of different 
thicknesses were deposited on L10 FePt at room temperature and capped with 10 nm SiO2. Magnetic 
hysteresis loops were measured at room temperature with vibration sample magnetometer (VSM, Lakeshore 
7400) with a maximum magnetic field of 2T. The film microstructure was observed by transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM).  
 
Results and Discussion: 
 6 
12.8kOe, 2.6kOe, respectively. The Ag/FePt film has higher out-of-plane Hc than single layer FePt as 
indicated in Fig. 2(d) and (f). This is due to the diffused Ag atoms from interface to form Ag phase around the 
FePt lattice that created the vacancies and increased the diffusivity of Fe or Pt atoms that promoted the FePt 
ordering and increased the film Hc.  
  Figure 3 shows XRD patterns of Ag/FePt bilayer and Ag/FePt/Ag trilayer. Figure 3(a) shows pattern of 
Ag/FePt bilayer annealed at 600
o
C for 5 minutes and the comparable (001) and (111) peaks were observed. 
The pattern in Fig. 3(b) is Ag/FePt/Ag(0.1nm) trilayer annealed at 600
o
C for 5 minutes. The (001) orientation 
is dominated and weak (110) and (002) are also found. Figure 3(c) shows the pattern of Ag/FePt/Ag(0.1nm) 
trilayer annealed at 700
o
C for 5 minutes. The intensity of (001) orientation enhanced with higher annealing 
temperature and the (111) fundamental peak reduced. Figure 3(d) shows patterns of Ag/FePt/Ag(0.9 nm) 
trilayer annealed at 700
o
C for 5 minutes. The (001) orientation is dominated and the (111) fundamental peak is 
also very weak. According to the (001) orientation, the Ag seed layer with thickness from 0.1nm to 0.9nm 
promote the FePt ordering as compared to the pattern in Fig. 1(c) for Ag/FePt sample annealed at 700
o
C for 5 
minutes. The LOF values in Fig. 3(a-d) are 0.26, 0.49, 0.65 and 0.66, respectively.  
Figure 4(a) shows magnetic hysteresis loops of Ag/FePt bilayer annealed at 600
o
C for 5 minutes. The film 
shows magnetic isotropy with similar in-plane Hc (6.7kOe) and out-of-plane Hc (5.2kOe). Figure 4(b) shows 
M-H loops of Ag/FePt/Ag(0.1nm) trilayer annealed at 600
o
C for 5 minutes. The out-of-plane Hc is 9.6kOe and 
the hysteresis of in-plane M-H loop is large with comparative Hc (7kOe). Figure 4(c)(d) shows Ag/FePt/Ag(x 
nm) trilayer annealed at 700
o
C for 5 minutes with Ag seed layer thickness is 0.1nm and 0.9nm, respectively. 
The films show perpendicular anisotropy with higher out-of-plane Hc 10.4kOe, and 11.1kOe, respectively. 
The value of in-pane Hc 4.2kOe, and 6.3kOe, indicated the c-axis distribution of films. In Fig. 4(c), the Ku was 
estimated to be about 1.19x10
7
 erg/cm

 by extending the easy-axis and hard axis of film and find the 
intersection point.  
Figure 5(a)(b) shows the TEM bright field images and corresponded SAD patterns of Ag/FePt bilayer 
annealed at 600 and 700
o
C for 5 minutes. In Fig 5(a), the Ag grains were attributed randomly in FePt matrix. 
Figure 5(b) shows TEM image of Ag/FePt film annealing at 700
o
C for 5min. The annealing twin was found 
and the FePt average grain size was estimated about 42.4 nm. The Ag grains were aggregated in white contrast 
areas indicated by arrows in Figure 5(b) are more clearly than sample annealing at 600
o
C. Figure 5(c)(d) and 
(e)(f) shows the TEM bright field images and corresponded grain size distribution plots of Ag/FePt bilayer 
annealed at 800
o
C for 5minutes. In Fig 5(c), the FePt grains are polyhedral (area: A) and many sub-grains 
(area: B) were observed. The magnification image of area B was shown in Fig. 5(d). The average grain size in 
area A, B were 129nm, 15.4nm for Ag/fePt sample annealing at 800
o
C in vacuum. The grain size distribution 
was plot in Fig. 5(e)(f), and it is monodisperse in area B with much smaller grain size compared to that in area 
A. The coalesced sub-grains areas were observed clearly (white contrast: B) and the reflection in the selected 
area diffraction (SAD) pattern indicated that FePt (111) orientation. Because the diffusion of Ag layer at 
800
o
C thoroughly, and the separated FePt grains in (111) orientation were confined in specific areas. In area A 
(black contrast), the presence of the (110) reflection in the SAD pattern and the (001) superlattice reflection in 
the XRD patterns indicate that the c-axis is oriented in the perpendicular direction to the film plane. The 
distribution of Ag atoms was indexed by energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) in TEM. The high Ag content 
(14%) was found in the sub-grains boundaries within B area. The morphology of FePt sub-grains are 
disrupted by the diffused and immiscible Ag layer and the grain growth was inhibited.  
 8 
decreased to 0.12 kOe. The in in-plane hysteresis loops deviated from a linear shape, indicating that the 
soft/hard interface coupling was weakened and the Fe magnetization turns easily to the in-plane direction 
under an applied field. When the thickness of the Fe layer is 15nm, as shown in Fig. 1(d), the coupling 
changed to exchange-spring like behavior in the in-plane hysteresis loops. The magnetization reversal process 
changes from a single switching field to a two-step reversal processes and results from domain wall 
nucleation and propagation from the Fe layer into the FePt layer. There are two reasons for out-of-plane 
texture to in-plane texture. One is due to the c-axis distributed FePt film and form the interface micro-torque 
between Fe and FePt magnetization. The other is due to the formation of domain wall inside the Fe layer with 
thickness of 10, 15, 20 nm. The domain wall motion was perpendicular to the in-plane Fe magnetization.  
The Fe(x)/FePt (x=2-6 nm) bilayer reveals strong interlayer coupling at the sharp soft/hard interface. The 
coupling between soft/hard layers was controlled by the Fe layer thickness. The switching field with 
optimized interlayer exchange coupling for the two-spin model theoretically depends on the ratio 
(Msofttsoft/Mhardthard)
22
. The theoretical normalized switching field (h
2
sw, opt) and optimal coupling energy (opt) 
depends on (Msofttsoft/Mhardthard) was shown in Fig. 2
22
. The normalized out-of- plane coercivity (Hc) versus 
 is also plotted in Fig. 2 and compared with the h
2
sw, opt theoretical curves. The variation of out-of-plane Hc 
depends on the ratio (Msofttsoft/ Mhardthard) and is slower than the theoretical curve.  
To identify the in-plane switching behavior of exchange-spring like Fe(x)/FePt (x=10, 15, 20nm) bilayers, 
the soft layer domain wall width was calculated by the formula
1, 15
 
                                                (1) 
where Happl is the applied field, and Asoft and Msoft are the stiffness constant and saturation magnetization of 
the soft layer, respectively. Fig. 1(d) shows the M-H loops of an exchange-spring like Fe(15nm)/FePt bilayer. 
For the in-plane M-H loop, soft layer switching occurred at the applied field (point A: Happl~0.84 kOe). In this 
field the domain wall is pinned near the hard/soft interface mostly in the soft layer. As the applied field 
increases the domain wall in the soft layer is compressed and penetrates more into the hard layer. Once the 
applied field reaches (point B: Happl~ 12.4 kOe) the domain wall depins from the hard/soft interface and 
propagates through the entire hard layer. The domain wall width at the switching field (point A: Happl~0.84 
kOe) is about ldw
soft
 ~ 12 nm.  
Figure 3 shows TEM bright field images of FePt single layer and Fe (x nm)/FePt bilayer (x=3, 6). Figure 
3(a) shows TEM images and selected area diffraction (SAD) pattern of a FePt single layer annealed at 800
o
C 
for 10 minutes. In Fig. 3(a), the L10 FePt grains are distributed nearly continuously on the glass substrate. The 
annealed twins are found in some FePt grains due to the stress relaxation in recrystallination. The inset in Fig. 
3(a) shows a selected area diffraction (SAD) pattern of FePt film. The TEM images of Fe (3 nm)/FePt bilayer 
are shown in Fig. 3(b), the small Fe grains are almost separated on the FePt grains. The Fe average grains size 
was 13.9nm and the Fe (110) was indexed in the SAD pattern. Figure 3(c) shows TEM images, a SAD pattern 
and the grain size distribution of Fe (6 nm)/FePt bilayer. The SAD shows that the Fe (110) was also indexed. 
In Fig. 3(c), when the Fe layer thickness increased to 6nm, the Fe grains morphology is similar to the Fe 
grains image in Fig 3(b), and the average grains size was 11.7 nm. Figure S3 (supplemental material) shows 
cross-section TEM image of Fe (3 nm)/FePt film, the separated Fe grains were results from the capped SiO2 
layer and form the granular structure. The average Fe grains size was not related to the soft/hard exchange 
spring clearly evidenced in TEM.

thickness of the soft layer
7, 19-21
. 
The interaction between coercivity and soft layer thickness is quite different in different studies. 
 
The purpose of the study: 
(1) 
This study discusses the formation of (001) preferred orientation in FePt film on a glass substrate by RTA. 
Further, the current work uses the Ag capped layer and seed layer to study ordering temperature effect in FePt 
film. This research analyzes microstructures of FePt, Ag/FePt and Ag/FePt/Ag films to know the grains size 
and distribution after high temperature recrystallization.  
(2) 
This work discusses Fe soft layer thickness on the properties of exchange-spring Fe/FePt bilayer. The 
influence of Fe soft layer thicknesses on the out-of-plane coercivity (Hc) are discussed by the two spin model 
for rigid magnetic film. The magnetization reversal of exchange-spring like film was interpreted by domain 
wall motion. 
 
Experimental: 
(1) 
The FePt single layer, Ag/FePt bilayer and Ag/FePt/Ag trilayer were fabricated by DC magnetron 
sputtering. The thickness of FePt film was fixed at 10nm. The capped Ag layer was fixed at 1 nm and seed 
layer was 0.1nm or 0.9nm. The base pressure of the sputtering system was 2x10
-8
 Torr and the working 
pressure was 3x10
-3
 Torr under high purity Argon gas. The FePt alloy target was used and the films were 
deposited on the glass substrate (Corning 1737). After deposition, the films were annealed by using rapid 
thermal annealing (RTA) system at the temperature from 400
o
C to 800
o
C in vacuum for 5 minutes. 
The crystal structure of the films was examined by a grazing incident x-ray diffractometry (XRD, MAC 
Sience, MXP 18) with Cu K radiation (=0.1541nm). The microstructure of the films was observed by high 
resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL2010). Magnetic hysteresis loops were measured 
at room temperature by using vibration sample magnetometer (VSM, Lakeshore7400) with the maximum 
magnetic field of 1.8T.

  The Fe (x nm)/FePt (10nm) (x= 2-20 nm) bilayer were fabricated with DC magnetron sputtering. The 
base pressure of the sputtering system was 2x10
-8
 Torr and the working pressure was 1.5x10
-3
 Torr under high 
purity argon gas. The FePt alloy target was used and the films were deposited on a glass substrate. The film 
chemical composition is Fe56Pt44 measured by energy dispersive spectrometers (EDS). After deposition, the 
films were annealed by a rapid thermal process (RTP) at 800
o
C for 10 minutes. Fe layers of different 
thicknesses were deposited on L10 FePt at room temperature and capped with 10 nm SiO2. Magnetic 
hysteresis loops were measured at room temperature with vibration sample magnetometer (VSM, Lakeshore 
7400) with a maximum magnetic field of 2T. The film microstructure was observed by transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM).  
 
Results and Discussion: 
 6 
12.8kOe, 2.6kOe, respectively. The Ag/FePt film has higher out-of-plane Hc than single layer FePt as 
indicated in Fig. 2(d) and (f). This is due to the diffused Ag atoms from interface to form Ag phase around the 
FePt lattice that created the vacancies and increased the diffusivity of Fe or Pt atoms that promoted the FePt 
ordering and increased the film Hc.  
  Figure 3 shows XRD patterns of Ag/FePt bilayer and Ag/FePt/Ag trilayer. Figure 3(a) shows pattern of 
Ag/FePt bilayer annealed at 600
o
C for 5 minutes and the comparable (001) and (111) peaks were observed. 
The pattern in Fig. 3(b) is Ag/FePt/Ag(0.1nm) trilayer annealed at 600
o
C for 5 minutes. The (001) orientation 
is dominated and weak (110) and (002) are also found. Figure 3(c) shows the pattern of Ag/FePt/Ag(0.1nm) 
trilayer annealed at 700
o
C for 5 minutes. The intensity of (001) orientation enhanced with higher annealing 
temperature and the (111) fundamental peak reduced. Figure 3(d) shows patterns of Ag/FePt/Ag(0.9 nm) 
trilayer annealed at 700
o
C for 5 minutes. The (001) orientation is dominated and the (111) fundamental peak is 
also very weak. According to the (001) orientation, the Ag seed layer with thickness from 0.1nm to 0.9nm 
promote the FePt ordering as compared to the pattern in Fig. 1(c) for Ag/FePt sample annealed at 700
o
C for 5 
minutes. The LOF values in Fig. 3(a-d) are 0.26, 0.49, 0.65 and 0.66, respectively.  
Figure 4(a) shows magnetic hysteresis loops of Ag/FePt bilayer annealed at 600
o
C for 5 minutes. The film 
shows magnetic isotropy with similar in-plane Hc (6.7kOe) and out-of-plane Hc (5.2kOe). Figure 4(b) shows 
M-H loops of Ag/FePt/Ag(0.1nm) trilayer annealed at 600
o
C for 5 minutes. The out-of-plane Hc is 9.6kOe and 
the hysteresis of in-plane M-H loop is large with comparative Hc (7kOe). Figure 4(c)(d) shows Ag/FePt/Ag(x 
nm) trilayer annealed at 700
o
C for 5 minutes with Ag seed layer thickness is 0.1nm and 0.9nm, respectively. 
The films show perpendicular anisotropy with higher out-of-plane Hc 10.4kOe, and 11.1kOe, respectively. 
The value of in-pane Hc 4.2kOe, and 6.3kOe, indicated the c-axis distribution of films. In Fig. 4(c), the Ku was 
estimated to be about 1.19x10

 by extending the easy-axis and hard axis of film and find the 
intersection point.  
Figure 5(a)(b) shows the TEM bright field images and corresponded SAD patterns of Ag/FePt bilayer 
annealed at 600 and 700
o
C for 5 minutes. In Fig 5(a), the Ag grains were attributed randomly in FePt matrix. 
Figure 5(b) shows TEM image of Ag/FePt film annealing at 700
o
C for 5min. The annealing twin was found 
and the FePt average grain size was estimated about 42.4 nm. The Ag grains were aggregated in white contrast 
areas indicated by arrows in Figure 5(b) are more clearly than sample annealing at 600
o
C. Figure 5(c)(d) and 
(e)(f) shows the TEM bright field images and corresponded grain size distribution plots of Ag/FePt bilayer 
annealed at 800
o
C for 5minutes. In Fig 5(c), the FePt grains are polyhedral (area: A) and many sub-grains 
(area: B) were observed. The magnification image of area B was shown in Fig. 5(d). The average grain size in 
area A, B were 129nm, 15.4nm for Ag/fePt sample annealing at 800
o
C in vacuum. The grain size distribution 
was plot in Fig. 5(e)(f), and it is monodisperse in area B with much smaller grain size compared to that in area 
A. The coalesced sub-grains areas were observed clearly (white contrast: B) and the reflection in the selected 
area diffraction (SAD) pattern indicated that FePt (111) orientation. Because the diffusion of Ag layer at 
800
o
C thoroughly, and the separated FePt grains in (111) orientation were confined in specific areas. In area A 
(black contrast), the presence of the (110) reflection in the SAD pattern and the (001) superlattice reflection in 
the XRD patterns indicate that the c-axis is oriented in the perpendicular direction to the film plane. The 
distribution of Ag atoms was indexed by energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) in TEM. The high Ag content 
(14%) was found in the sub-grains boundaries within B area. The morphology of FePt sub-grains are 
disrupted by the diffused and immiscible Ag layer and the grain growth was inhibited.  
 8 
decreased to 0.12 kOe. The in in-plane hysteresis loops deviated from a linear shape, indicating that the 
soft/hard interface coupling was weakened and the Fe magnetization turns easily to the in-plane direction 
under an applied field. When the thickness of the Fe layer is 15nm, as shown in Fig. 1(d), the coupling 
changed to exchange-spring like behavior in the in-plane hysteresis loops. The magnetization reversal process 
changes from a single switching field to a two-step reversal processes and results from domain wall 
nucleation and propagation from the Fe layer into the FePt layer. There are two reasons for out-of-plane 
texture to in-plane texture. One is due to the c-axis distributed FePt film and form the interface micro-torque 
between Fe and FePt magnetization. The other is due to the formation of domain wall inside the Fe layer with 
thickness of 10, 15, 20 nm. The domain wall motion was perpendicular to the in-plane Fe magnetization.  
The Fe(x)/FePt (x=2-6 nm) bilayer reveals strong interlayer coupling at the sharp soft/hard interface. The 
coupling between soft/hard layers was controlled by the Fe layer thickness. The switching field with 
optimized interlayer exchange coupling for the two-spin model theoretically depends on the ratio 
(Msofttsoft/Mhardthard)
22
. The theoretical normalized switching field (h
2
sw, opt) and optimal coupling energy (opt) 
depends on (Msofttsoft/Mhardthard) was shown in Fig. 2
22
. The normalized out-of- plane coercivity (Hc) versus 
 is also plotted in Fig. 2 and compared with the h
2
sw, opt theoretical curves. The variation of out-of-plane Hc 
depends on the ratio (Msofttsoft/ Mhardthard) and is slower than the theoretical curve.  
To identify the in-plane switching behavior of exchange-spring like Fe(x)/FePt (x=10, 15, 20nm) bilayers, 
the soft layer domain wall width was calculated by the formula
1, 15
 
                                                (1) 
where Happl is the applied field, and Asoft and Msoft are the stiffness constant and saturation magnetization of 
the soft layer, respectively. Fig. 1(d) shows the M-H loops of an exchange-spring like Fe(15nm)/FePt bilayer. 
For the in-plane M-H loop, soft layer switching occurred at the applied field (point A: Happl~0.84 kOe). In this 
field the domain wall is pinned near the hard/soft interface mostly in the soft layer. As the applied field 
increases the domain wall in the soft layer is compressed and penetrates more into the hard layer. Once the 
applied field reaches (point B: Happl~ 12.4 kOe) the domain wall depins from the hard/soft interface and 
propagates through the entire hard layer. The domain wall width at the switching field (point A: Happl~0.84 
kOe) is about ldw
soft
 ~ 12 nm.  
Figure 3 shows TEM bright field images of FePt single layer and Fe (x nm)/FePt bilayer (x=3, 6). Figure 
3(a) shows TEM images and selected area diffraction (SAD) pattern of a FePt single layer annealed at 800
o
C 
for 10 minutes. In Fig. 3(a), the L10 FePt grains are distributed nearly continuously on the glass substrate. The 
annealed twins are found in some FePt grains due to the stress relaxation in recrystallination. The inset in Fig. 
3(a) shows a selected area diffraction (SAD) pattern of FePt film. The TEM images of Fe (3 nm)/FePt bilayer 
are shown in Fig. 3(b), the small Fe grains are almost separated on the FePt grains. The Fe average grains size 
was 13.9nm and the Fe (110) was indexed in the SAD pattern. Figure 3(c) shows TEM images, a SAD pattern 
and the grain size distribution of Fe (6 nm)/FePt bilayer. The SAD shows that the Fe (110) was also indexed. 
In Fig. 3(c), when the Fe layer thickness increased to 6nm, the Fe grains morphology is similar to the Fe 
grains image in Fig 3(b), and the average grains size was 11.7 nm. Figure S3 (supplemental material) shows 
cross-section TEM image of Fe (3 nm)/FePt film, the separated Fe grains were results from the capped SiO2 
layer and form the granular structure. The average Fe grains size was not related to the soft/hard exchange 
spring clearly evidenced in TEM.
