Abstract 
As shading, an important factor in urban environments, affects thermal 
environments and long-term thermal comfort, this study conducted several field 
experiments to analyze the outdoor thermal conditions on urban streets in central 
Taiwan. The RayMan model was utilized for predicting long-term thermal comfort 
using meteorological data for a 10-year period. Analytical results indicate that slightly 
shaded areas typically have highly frequent hot conditions during summer, particularly 
at noon. However, highly shaded locations generally have a low physiologically

that the spatial distribution of physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) at the street 
level depended strongly on the H/W ratio of urban streets. Emmanuel et al. [14] 
conducted field experiments at five locations during spring in the city of Colombo, Sri 
Lanka. They calculated the Tmrt and PET using the RayMan model [24], and found that 
deep street canyons (i.e., highly shaded streets) improved the outdoor thermal comfort 
of pedestrians. Lin et al. [25] indicated that studies with few field experiments can 
elucidate characteristics measured (or simulated) on a particular day and likely do not 
represent annual thermal conditions. Therefore, they conducted several field 
experiments to analyze outdoor thermal conditions at a university campus in central 
Taiwan, and employed the RayMan model for predicting long-term thermal comfort 
using meteorological data for a 10-year period. The thermal comfort range of PETs of 
Taiwanese residents obtained in a previous study [26] was also applied as the criterion 
for determining whether a thermal environment is comfortable or uncomfortable.  
However, some issues related to shading on urban streets need further clarification. 
First, previous studies have not discussed the relationship between shading and thermal 
comfort in different seasons. Since a thermal environment may be comfortable in 
summer and cold in winter under the same amount of shade, the thermal comfort of a 
location must be addressed in different seasons. Furthermore, thermal comfort may vary 
at different times of the day (e.g. hot at noon and cool in the morning); thus, one must 
also determine the thermal comfort distribution during a given day to elucidate the 
thermal conditions at different times.  
Buildings on Taiwan’s traditional streets are mostly residential and commercial, 
i.e., the first floor is rented by stores and all other floors are residential. If these 
buildings are not designed with an arcade on the ground floor and lack shading, people 
must walk beside the street while shopping, and are exposed to the outdoor climate.

32-34]. In addition to factors needed to calculate PET using the RayMan model, such as 
Ta, relative humidity (RH) (or Vp), v, human clothing and activity, and Tmrt, which is 
the most important factor when calculating PET, can be estimated by importing the 
observed value of global radiation (Gr) or by importing the year, date, time, location, 
and cloud cover (Cd). Furthermore, environmental factors, such as albedo, the Bowen 
ratio of ground surface and the Linke turbidity of air can be adjusted in the RayMan 
model. When calculating PET, fisheye photographs of the sky taken from measurement 
locations are imported into the RayMan model to include the shading effect while 
calculating short- and long-wave radiation fluxes. Moreover, the ratio of free sky spaces 
to the entire fisheye view, the SVF, can be calculated using the RayMan model. The 
SVF, ranging between 0 and 1, represents totally obstructed and totally free spaces, 
respectively. After thermal factors and fisheye photos are imported into the model, the 
PET, Tmrt, and SVF at a certain location are output for subsequent analyses [25]. 
2.3 Previous thermal comfort ranges for locals  
Previous studies examining thermal adaptation indicated that occupant thermal 
sensations and preferences vary considerably due to differences in behavioral 
adjustment, physiological acclimatization, and psychological habituation or 
expectations [35], all of which may contribute to different thermal comfort ranges, i.e., 
the range of thermal indices at which people feel comfortable. Therefore, the thermal 
comfort range for a particular region may not be applicable to other regions. In this 
study, the thermal comfort range is acquired from a field survey of 1644 subjects in 
Taiwan [26]. In this survey, 26–30°C PET was the ―neutral‖ sensation, 18–22°C PET 
was ―slightly cool,‖ 14–18°C PET was ―cool,‖ and <14°C PET was ―cold‖; additionally, 
30–34°C PET was ―slightly warm,‖ 34–38°C PET was ―warm,‖ 38–42°C PET was 
―hot,‖ and >42°C PET was ―very hot.‖ As these thermal comfort ranges have been 
applied generally in Taiwan, a hot and humid country [25], these thermal comfort

above ground level on a tripod at locations A–F and K to measure Ta, RH, and Tg. At 
location K, v and Gr were also measured simultaneously. Measurements were recorded 
at 1-min intervals automatically from 08:00–18:00, as this is the period when shoppers 
are outdoors most; thus, this period is also the period used in subsequent analyses. Four 
field experiments were conducted, one in each season, to ensure data representativeness 
of climate characteristics in each season.  
3.2 Model validation 
The RayMan model must be validated by comparing field measurements and 
model simulation results to fit the local climate and predict long-term thermal comfort 
accurately. Since Tmrt is an integrated thermal index representing the combination of 
Ta, v, and short- and long-wave radiation fluxes, and can be determined via both 
measurements and simulations, the consistency between measured and modeled Tmrt 
was utilized as a criterion for model validation. The measured Tmrt was calculated 
using Ta, Tg, and v based on ISO standard 7726 [36]. The mean convection coefficient 
was corrected using the method developed by Thorsson et al. [37]. The modeled Tmrt 
was calculated using the RayMan model by importing the same factors used in 
calculating PET. 
As Gr was only measured on the roof at location K, the Gr values for locations 
A–F must be estimated before using the RayMan model to calculate Tmrt. First, date, 
time, and location are imported into the RayMan model, and Cd was set at 0 (no clouds) 
to 8 (full cloud cover). The RayMan model then output nine curves representing the Gr 
under different Cd levels. Second, the measured Gr values on the day that overlapped 
these nine curves were used, such that actual Cd for each period was obtained. Third, as 
the A–F locations are close to K, we assume Cd at A–F is the same as that at K. 
Therefore, the unknown Gr values for locations A–F can be estimated by importing Cd, 
fisheye photographs, and other climatic and environmental factors into the RayMan

(unshaded) at locations A–F are the same as those at K. Therefore, Ta and v at locations 
A–F must be corrected before being imported into the model.  
To correct Ta for each location, this study utilized data from four field experiments 
to establish a regression model. The Tai for location i (i=A–F) were predicted using the 
Ta, v, and Gr of location K, which can be derived by

where Tak,vk and Grk are air temperature, wind speed, and global radiation at location F, 
respectively; αi, βi, γi, and δi are regression coefficients of location i; and Taa to Taf are 
strongly correlated (R

=0.92–0.96, p-value<0.001).  
To correct the wind speed, this study adopted the estimation method applied by 
Spagnolo and de Dear [27] and derived wind speed for each location as

where vi is wind speed at locations A–F, vk is wind speed at location F, and hi and hf 
represent 1.1 m and 10m as the heights of locations A–F, and K, respectively. The mean 
speed exponent m, which was estimated using surface roughness, was set at 0.45–0.62 
in this study.  
Notably, although Gr (unshaded) and Cd at locations A–F are assumed the same as 
those at location K, fisheye photographs (Fig. 1) were also imported into the model to 
include the shading effect while calculating short- and long-wave radiation fluxes. 
4. Results and discussion 
4.1 Field experiment results 
Field experiments were conducted on January 11, 2009, during winter, on March 
22, 2009, during spring, on August 1, 2009, during summer, and on October 18, 2008, 
11 
(Fig. 4(a)). The FPET>30 values for highly shaded locations (i.e., A and B) were < 40% 
throughout the whole year, while that of the slightly shaded location (i.e., F) was >60% 
during June to August. However, the FPET<26 was low in summer, spring, and fall and 
high in winter at all locations (Fig. 4(b)). The FPET<26 values for highly shaded locations 
(i.e., A and B) were close to 100% during winter, while that for slightly shaded location 
F was much lower than those for the remaining locations during winter, spring, and 
autumn.  
The F26<PET<30 of the slightly shaded location, F, was 10–30% all year, while that of 
the highly shaded locations, A, and B, was high in summer and low in winter (Fig. 4(c)). 
This is because the warm condition at these highly shaded locations seldom occurred 
during summer (FPET>30<40%) and cool conditions were extremely frequent during 
winter (FPET<26 almost 100%); thus, thermal comfort peaked in summer and was rare in 
winter at highly shaded locations. Therefore, different shading levels contribute to the 
variation in the thermal perception distribution.  
4.4 Mean thermal sensations at different periods in a day 
However, the frequency of each thermal perception acquired in the previous 
sections is difficult to use when interpreting thermal comfort variations during a given 
day (e.g., differences between morning and afternoon). Therefore, this study generated 
the PET isotherm for each location for further elucidation. Figure 5 shows a PET 
isotherm, where the x-coordinate refers to the month and the y-coordinate is time. This 
study calculated PET averages for different times for each 10-day period using PET 
data for 2000–2009. For example, PET at 6:00 on Jan. 1–10 was the average of 100 
climate data (10 year*10 days) at 6:00 from Jan. 1–10 in 2000–2009. Based on this 
principle, this study calculated PET and generated the PET isotherm using the Kriging 
algorithm in the Surfer® program. 
This study chose three locations with different levels of shading to determine their

winter had the lowest value. These analytical results reveal that the FPET>30 is more 
sensitive to variation in the SVF in hot seasons than in cool seasons. Furthermore, 
FPET>30 was highest in summer given the same SVF value for the same location.  
The correlation between SVF and FPET<26 was negative, i.e., locations with a low 
SVF (highly shaded) were cool (Fig. 6(b)). Based on the slope of the four fitted lines, 
the values for spring and autumn were highest. Analytical results demonstrate that the 
FPET<26 was more sensitive to the variation in the SVF in spring and autumn than in 
summer and winter. Furthermore, FPET<26 was highest in winter given the same SVF 
value for the same location. 
The correlation between the SVF and F26<PET<30 was negative in winter and positive 
in the other seasons, i.e., locations with a high SVF are comfortable in winter and 
uncomfortable in other seasons (Fig. 6(c)).  
These experimental results reveal some important phenomena. First, shaded 
locations have fewer warm hours, especially in summer, than non-shaded locations. The 
elevation of the sun is high at noon in summer, which increases the likelihood of 
sunlight directly hitting the street, likely accounts for this finding. Conversely, locations 
with considerable shading increase the duration of cool hours. When the comfort 
condition is evaluated, highly shaded areas are beneficial in spring, summer, and 
autumn, while minimal shade is comfortable only in winter as increased sunlight (solar 
radiation) overcomes the original cool-air condition. Therefore, the effects of shading 
vary in different seasons. 
4. Conclusions

Taiwan, and discussed the effects of shading on long-term outdoor thermal comfort.
