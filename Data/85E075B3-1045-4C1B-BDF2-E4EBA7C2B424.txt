Abstract
The “size effect”is significant when
the strain gradient is high in the micro
forming process. In order to investigate this
“size effect”influence, this paper develops a
static-explicit finite element code which
incorporates the strain gradient plasticity. The
extended minr technique is used to
determine the punch stroke increment of each
step in the simulation. A micro
stretch-bending process is designed to verify
the development of the finite element method.
Two sheet thickness, 0.2 mm and 0.05 mm
(50 micron), are tested. From comparison of
the punch load versus punch stroke relation
between these two sheet thickness. The strain
gradient influence will begin to appear for
0.2 mm, whereas the strain gradient is
significant for 0.05 mm. The results of the
equivalent stress happened in the serious
deformed element also shows that the strain
gradient is significant for 0.05 mm. The
observed results prove that the strain gradient
plasticity theory will be useful in the micro
forming process.
Keywords: size effect, strain gradient, micro
forming.
1. Introduction
In the classical continuum, the material
constitutive equation does not include the
micro-structure in the forming process. As a
result, the constitutive equation assumes that
the stress state is determined by the strain by
a power law or linear relation. Although this
classical constitutive equation is sufficient
for most of the forming process, but it will be
not enough to trace the stress state while the
specimen size reaches micro-scale. This “size 
efect” mainly comes from the strain gradient 
is strong in the micro-scale [1]. In the strain
gradient plasticity theory, an intrinsic
material length is introduced into the
constitutive equation with the first order or
Laplacian strain gradient [2]. As the strain
gradient is related to its neighboring strain
area, it is nature to define the strain gradient
theory is non-local continuum used to solve
the micro-scale manufacturing process.

6The flow chart of this direct finite
element strain gradient plasticity is
summarized as follows:
1. Using minr technique to determine the
punch stroke, nodal displacement and
corresponding strain and plastic strain
increments of each integration point.
2. Compute the increment of gradient term
p of each column’s eight integration
points.
3. Adopting equation (33) to solve i for
each column’s eight integration points.
4. Update the total effective plastic strain and
gradient plastic strain. The stresses are also
updated for each column’s eight
integration points.
5. Using the updated stresses and effective
plastic strain and gradient plastic strain to
test whether the yielding condition is
satisfied or not.
6. If the convergence is not satisfied, return
step 2 to continue the iteration loop. If the
convergence is satisfied, go to step 1 for
the next punch stroke.
4. Results and discussion
The above strain gradient plasticity is
directly developed into the elasto-plastic
finite element program to verify the size
effect in the micro stretch-bending process.
Two different sheet thicknesses, 0.2 mm and
0.05 mm, are investigated. Figure 4 shows
the punch load versus punch stroke relation
for sheet thickness 0.2 mm with punch stroke
reaching 1.2 mm. It is observed that the load
for classical elasto-plastic constitutive model
(c=0) is lower than the strain gradient
constitutive model (c=50). When the punch
stroke reaches 1.2 mm, the punch loads are
113.1736 N and 118.0618 N for C=0 and
C=50, respectively. The load of C=50 is
about 4.3% larger than the load of C=0.
Figure 5 depicts the deformation state at
various punch strokes. From the deformation
state, it shows the sheet is smoothly stretched
and bent into the die in the simulation
involved strain gradient effect. Figure 6
shows the equivalent stress states of element
14, which has large deformation in the
forming process, for different punch strokes.
The stress is the average value of four
Gaussian points in the element, and the
stresses are 507.21 Mpa and 522.61 Mpa for
C=0 and C=50, respectively. From figures 4
and 6, it is found that the strain gradient
effect begins to appear for the sheet thickness
0.2 mm. Figure 7 shows the punch load
versus punch stroke relation for sheet
thickness 0.05 mm, or 50 micron, with punch
stroke reaching 0.3 mm. The loads are 28.29
N and 31.8 N for C=0 and C=50 at punch
stroke 0.3 mm. The load of C=50 is about
12.4% larger than the load of C=0. Figure 8
shows the equivalent stress states of element
14. The stress is 637.16 Mpa for C=50, while
the stress is 507.21 Mpa for C=0. From
figures 7 and 8, the strain gradient effect is
significant for the sheet thickness 0.05 mm,
or 50 micron.
5. Conclusions
This paper develops a static-explicit
elasto-plastic finite element code which
associates the constitutive equations with the
strain gradient effect. The explicit non-local
gradient elasto-plastic tangent modulus is
derived by the plastic multipliers of the
neighboring Gaussian integration points.
After combining the extended minr
technique, which is used to determine the
punch stroke increment of each step, to the
code, the micro sheet stretch-bending process
is successfully simulated. From the punch
load versus punch stroke relation and the
trace of equivalent stress of a serious
deformed element 14, it is concluded that the
“size effect”is significant, and can not be
omitted, when the strain gradient is high in
the micro forming process.
