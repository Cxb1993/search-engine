?3? increasing external quantum
efficiency (EQE) by adopting
non-planar device structure, and
?4? developing exciton harvesting
technique for increasing internal
quantum efficiency.
Also, we have to develop several
measurement techniques, such as:
?1? temperature dependent current
voltage,
?2? external quantum efficiency,
?3? transient electroluminescence, and
?4? time-of-flight.
Those measurements are used to investigate
quantitatively the root causes affecting the
OLED lifetime and to establish the physical
models of degradation mechanisms which
come from the organic materials, device
structures, fabrication method and
environments. Since it is difficult to
accomplish these goals in a short period, we
proposed a three-year project. However,
only one-year budget was granted. In such a
limited time and budget, we achieved:
?1? Using ambipolar transport material
as the host of the EML for green
phosphorescent, blue and white
fluorescent OLEDs for higher
efficiency and longer lifetime,
?2? developing ITO sputtering
techniques for fabricating tandem
OLED,
?3? adopting nano- and micro-structures
to increase EQE, and
?4? investigating the electrical and
optical characteristics of ambipolar
organic materials experimentally and
theoretically.
Keywords: organic light-emitting device,
device lifetime, device efficiency, carrier
transport.

Abstract- In this paper, we demonstrated a red 
phosphorescent organic light-emitting device with high efficiency 
and low driving-voltage (15.2cd/A at 6V with 1030cd/m2) by 
using hole- and electron-transport materials as the host of the 
emitting layer.  
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 
Organic light-emitting devices (OLED) has great potential 
for display application because of its rapid progress in 
material and device in recent years [1], [2]. Heavy-metal 
complexes, which strong spin-orbit coupling leads to 
singlet-triplet state mixing, result in high efficiency 
phosphorescent electroluminescence in an OLED [3]. 
Typically, phosphorescent emitter was doped in a charge 
transporting matrix to form an emitting layer (EML). 
4,4’-N,N’-dicarbazole-biphenyl (CBP) is one of the 
commonly-used host materials which shows remarkable 
enhancement in quantum efficiency in green and red devices 
because of its good energy alignment with the Iridium 
(Ir)-based dopant [4]. However, due to its wide bandgap 
characteristic, the driving voltage increases at the same time. 
In this paper, we demonstrate a high-efficiency and 
low-driving-voltage red PHOLED with transporting materials 
as the host of the EML. Since phosphorescent emitter with 
shorter exciton lifetime is important to prevent severe 
triplet-triplet annihilation (T-T annihilation), we used 
(nazo)2Ir(Fppz) [IrB2] which has a phosphorescent life time of 
1.05 µs as the red dopant [5]. The red dopant was doped into 
two typical transporting materials, including: N,N’- diphenyl- 
N,N’-bis(1-napthyl) -1,1’-biphenyl-4,4’-diamine (NPB) and 
bis(10 - hydroxybenzo [h]qinolinato)beryllium (Bebq2).  
 
II. EXPERIMENT 
 
Device structures of IrB2-based PHOLED are shown in 
Table I. Here, NPB and Bebq2 are served as the hole 
transporting layer (HTL) and electron transporting layer 
(ETL), respectively. For comparing the device performance of 
devices with and without hole blocking layer (HBL), we used 
aluminum(III) bis(2-methyl-8-quinolinato)4 -phenylphenolate 
(BAlq) as the HBL material which have been also reported as 
the host of phosphorescence OLED [6]. 
 
TABLE I Device structure of IrB2 and Balq based PHOLED (unit: Å) 
 
 
 
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Fig. 1 shows the J-V characteristic curves of device 1-7. 
Under the current density of 100 mA/cm2, the driving 
voltages of devices 1-7 are 13.2, 12.5, 10.2, 8.4, 14.9, 6.4 and 
5.8 V, respectively. We can see that device 5 exhibits the 
highest driving voltage due to the wide bandgap of the Balq. 
Device 7 has the lowest driving voltage. In this case, the host 
material is NPB and there is no red dopant. Device 6 has a 
driving voltage slightly higher than device 7 since the electron 
mobility of Bebq2 is lower than the hole mobility of NPB.

White Organic Light-Emitting Devices with 
Selectively-Doped Emitting Layer

Abstract- We designed the white organic light-emitting 
devices based on the selective doping technique. With a proper 
device design, our WOLED reaches 6.34cd/A and 3.64lm/W at 
6V with the luminance of 445cd/m2. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 
The academic researches and the commercial application of 
organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) with the multiple thin 
organic films structure blossomed from two decades ago [1], 
[2]. Due to the rapid development of new organic materials 
and devices, OLED has been regarded as one of the most 
promising display technologies. White OLEDs (WOLED), 
generating white light through the mixture of different color 
emitting materials, has drawn lots of attention since it can be 
not only used for display, but also lighting applications. Now, 
its efficiency is almost comparable to the incandescent light 
bulb [3]. In this study, we inserted a yellow dopant with a 
suitable position and concentration into the conventional blue 
emitting layer (EML). The position was determined for 
obtaining the maximum recombination rate which can 
effectively reduce the driving voltage and increase the current 
efficiency [4]. Lower and higher yellow dopant 
concentrations results in less recombination site and more 
serious concentration quench, respectively, which leads to the 
decrease of the current efficiency. 
 
II. EXPERIMENT 
 
In our experiments, we used indium-tin-oxide (ITO) glass 
substrates of low sheet resistance of 10 Ohm/sqr and a flat 
surface roughness of Ra<1 nm. The active region size in our 
test pixel is 2mm×2mm. Before deposition of organic 
materials, the pre-cleaned ITO-coated glass is treated for 1 
minute by oxygen plasma. Then, it is loaded in high vacuum 
chamber (~3×10-6 torr) to grow desired organic materials by 
thermal evaporation. Finally, the as-fabricated device is 
hermetically sealed by UV-cured epoxy in glove box. The 
current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics were measured 
using Keithley 2400 as source-meter. The 
electro-luminescence spectra were obtained by using Minolta 
CS-1000 spectrometer. 
Table I shows our device structures. White light is 
generated from complementary blue and yellow fluorescent 
dopants. The backboned blue OLED structure (device 1) is 
N,N’-diphenyl-N,N’-bis(1-napthyl)-1, 
1’-biphenyl-4,4’-diamine (NPB) (40nm)/ 2% DPAVBi doped 
ADN (45nm)/ tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq3) 
(15nm) where 4,4'-bis[2-(4-(N,N- diphenylamino)phenyl) 
vinyl]biphenyl (DPAVBi) is the blue dopant and 
9,10-bis(2’-naphthyl) anthracene (ADN) is the blue host. Here, 
NPB, DPAVBi doped ADN, and Alq3 are served as the hole 
transporting layer (HTL), EML, and electron transporting 
layer (ETL), respectively. A thin yellow rubrene doped layer 
with the thickness of 12 Å and the volume concentration of 
2% at different position of the EML (device 2, 3 and 4) was 
inserted into the EML of the blue device for measuring the 
recombination-rate distribution [2]. Devices 5 to 7 are used to 
investigate the effects of rubrene concentrations in the EML. 
 
TABLE I Device structures of the WOLED. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Fig. 1 shows the J – V characteristics of devices 1 to 4. 
Obviously, device 3 has lowest driving voltage of 7.85V at 
100 mA/cm2. J-V curves of all other devices are nearly 
identical with 9.16V at 100 mA/cm2. If the thin rubrene layer 
serves as the trapping site, the driving voltage of device 1 
should be the lowest. However, device 3 has the lowest 
driving voltages. The driving voltages of other devices are 
identical to that of device 1. Here, we provide a possible 
mechanism to explain the low driving voltages of device 3. 
Since the bandgap of the rubrene is within the DPAVBi and 
ADN, the incorporation of a thin rubrene layer provides an 
extra pathway to recombine the electron and hole which

on an organic light-emitting device attached by a microlens 
array film. The blurwidth was defined and the relations between 
the blurwidth and the luminance enhancement were discussed. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 
Organic light-emitting device (OLED) is one of the most 
promising display technologies for the next generation due to 
the advantages of low-power consumption, high brightness, 
high contrast, and potentially low cost [1], [2]. However, the 
light extraction efficiency in such a device is as low as 20 to 
30% due to the waveguiding effect of the glass substrate and 
indium-tin oxide (ITO)/organic layers [3], [4]. To improve, 
the microlens array film (MAF) is attached on the OLED to 
outcouple the guided light and enhance the extraction 
efficiency [5]. We found the ratio of the luminance 
enhancement increases with smaller microlens size and higher 
coverage ratio. On the other hand, the blur increases with 
higher luminance.  
 
II. EXPERIMENT 
 
Detailed fabrication processes of the MAF can be found in 
ref. [5]. Bases of microlenses of three different unit cell 
shapes (square, hexagonal and round ones) and two 
arrangements (square and hexagonal packed) for round ones 
are shown in Fig. 1. The series names are HI, HO, RI, RO, SC 
and SR corresponding to the base length of 28.9, 25, 50, 35.4, 
50 and 50 μ m, respectively. The size of each MAF is 5mm x 
5mm. The OLED, with the active area of 1cm x 1cm, is 
driven by a constant current of a source meter Keithley 2400. 
To measure the luminance and spectra of different view 
angles from the OLED, a high precision spectroradiometer 
Minolta CS-1000 is used.

In order to define the blurwidth, we take the image under 
microscope, and then transfer the color photos into 256 
gray-scale bitmap. Finally, we evaluate the pixel’s intensity 
along the cross-section as shown in Fig.2

Once the intensity distribution is obtained, we define the 
blurwidth as: 
 
Blurwidth (BW) = (L’-L)/2                 (1)
       
where L’ is the width with intensity of 1/e (0.368) of the 
maximum intensity and L is the original active pixel width.

Abstract  
Microstructure film attachment and surface roughing techniques 
had long been utilized to improve the light extraction efficiency 
from a light source with a high refractive index. Instead of merely 
concerning the efficiency for lighting purposes, we must take both 
the light extraction efficiency and image quality into account for 
display applications. The image blur was observed to decrease the 
contrast ratio and thus lower image quality. In our previous work, 
we have studied the image blur effect quantitatively and 
correlated it to the coverage ratio and light extraction efficiency. 
In this paper, we apply an innovative microstructure array 
arrangement to planar light emitting device, i.e., for organic light 
emitting display (OLED) to reduce the blur effect and keep almost 
the same efficiency as that obtained by applying a traditional 
microstructure array. 
1.  Objective and Background 
Organic light emitting device (OLED) is one of the most 
promising technologies for the next-generation display and 
lighting applications due to the advantages of self-emissive, low 
power consumption, wide viewing angle, high contrast ratio, fast 
response and flexible substrate capability.  
The external quantum efficiency of OLED device is the product of 
internal quantum efficiency and the light extraction efficiency. 
The internal quantum efficiency can be raised to nearly 100% [1], 
and the light extraction efficiency can be improved by 
microstructure attachment or surface roughing to modify the 
planar geometry of an OLED and to couple out the light trapped 
in the glass substrate. Nevertheless, considering display 
applications, the higher extraction efficiency, the more inclined 
rays are induced from the substrate and thus decrease the contrast 
ratio of the display. 
The objective of this paper is to improve the light extraction 
efficiency of the organic light-emitting device (OLED) with 
human eye acceptable image blur. To quantitatively evaluate the 
degree of blurring, we set up a criterion as the blur-width for the 
luminance distribution. The relationship between luminance 
improvement and image blur are discussed. Finally, a novel 
microstructure arrangement design is shown to gain sufficiently 
high efficiency enhancement and much less image blur than the 
traditional cases. 
2.  Results 
In our previous research results, both by experiment [2] and 
simulation [3], we find that the light extraction efficiency 
becomes higher with higher coverage ratio(CR) of 
microstructures, where the coverage ratio defined by the ratio of 
micro-structured area to the substrate area. However, image blur  
was observed to decrease the contrast ratio and thus lower the 
image quality. To find the relationship between luminance  
efficiency enhancement and image blur, we quantitatively define 
the blur-width (the full width at 1/e2 of the peak intensity). 
Furthermore, with nearly full microlens coverage, the blur-width 
was shown to be pronounced as the luminance efficiency 
enhancement was increased [4]. 
From Figure 1 (a) and (b), the simulated pixel blur is quite similar 
with the experimental one, and the donut-like dark shadows are 
observed around the centers of microlenses. This can be explained 
by Figure 1 (c): the parallel rays will be reflected by the edge of 
microlens due to large incident angle. While the edges of 
microlenses can help to extract the inclined rays and enhance the 
luminance efficiency, image blur effect is also accompanied with 
it. 
The traditional approach is to uniformly distribute the 
microstructures on the substrate. From the above observation, we 
propose an innovative microstructure arrangement design, which 
we called the “defect” microstructure array: the microstructures 
upon the pixels are removed to increase the forward parallel ray 
flux. These defects prevent the inclined rays to be extracted from 
the neighboring pixels, so they reduce the extraction efficiency 
but also the crosstalk or blur. The remaining microstructures keep 
the extraction ability of the inclined rays. To sum up, light 
extraction efficiency is kept the quite same but the image blur can 
be reduced as compared with the traditional approach. 
To demonstrate the influence of the “defect” microstructure 
arrangement, we establish a series of optical model. Figure 2 
shows a group of RGB sub-pixels of the AMOLED without 
microstructure and the corresponding luminance distribution 
along x- and y-axis. 
In Figure 3, with the traditional microstructure array applied, 
the luminance distribution of x- and y-axis are spread outside the 
pixel. That is, the three sub-pixel image is suffered from image 
blur. 
In Figure 4, the novel “defect” microstructure arrangement 
is shown to be with little image blur. 
Figure 5 shows the relative radiant intensity vs. view angle. 
The normal-direction (zero degree) luminance enhancement of the 
novel “defect” microstructure arrangement is slightly larger than 
that of the traditional microstructures. However, the power 
efficiency is summed up to be a little bit less than that of the 
traditional case full of microstructure. 
In Table 1, we summarize the relationship of relative power, 
luminance, x- and y-axis blur-width for the cases without, with 
traditional and with “defect” 157 μm x 39 μm microstructure array 
films. The case with “defect” microstructure array exhibits higher 
relative luminance than that of the traditional case, keep certain

Abstract 
We demonstrate a hybrid device by vertically integrating a 
reflective LCD and a transparent OLED. The vertical alignment 
(VA) LC cell operated at normally black (NB) mode is placed 
beneath the transparent OLED to improve device transmittance. 
Under dark ambient, OLED is the primary display but the NB-
RLCD absorbs the incoming light which in turn increases the 
ambient contrast ratio (A-CR). However, it also absorbs the 
photons from the OLED emission and decreases the efficiency. In 
our hybrid device, by placing the transparent OLED on top of the 
reflective LCD, the transmittance of the hybrid device is enhanced 
by 57.3% due to the asymmetric emission intensities from both 
sides of the transparent OLED. Under bright ambient conditions, 
the OLED could be washed out but the RLCD is activated. Hence, 
the tandem display exhibits a high contrast ratio (>105:1) under 
any ambient light conditions.  
1. Introduction 
Organic light-emitting displays (OLEDs) have recently attracted 
much attention because of the advantages of self-emission, wide 
viewing angle, high brightness, high contrast, and potentially low 
cost [1]. However, sunlight readability of such a device is still one 
of the disadvantages due to the strong reflection from the metal 
electrode. The ambient-contrast-ratio (A-CR) decreases as the 
ambient light increases. To improve A-CR, a film attachment 
consisting of a circular polarizer or a destructive interference layer 
inside the OLED device which is called Black LayerTM technique 
was proposed to eliminate the ambient reflection [2]. Even 
though, it is still a challenge to use this emissive device under 
clear sky or direct sun. 
On the other hand, transflective LCDs have been widely used for 
mobile displays. In a transflective LCD, each pixel is split into 
transmissive (T) and reflective (R) sub-pixels. The T-mode is 
intended for dark ambient and R-mode for bright ambient. 
Therefore, a high ambient contrast ratio (A-CR) can always be 
obtained, independent of ambient light conditions [3]. However, 
the planar integration of T- and R-modes of the transflective LCD 
limits the aperture ratio which, in turn, degrades the display 
resolution and brightness. To overcome this shortcoming, a 
tandem structure which vertically integrates an OLED and a 
normally black reflective LCD (NB-RLCD) was proposed [4]. 
This device not only increases the aperture ratio but also enhances 
the A-CR, as compared to the conventional transflective LCD. In 
such a structure, OLED (T-mode) is placed underneath the RLCD 
(R-mode) where the anode of the OLED is also used as the 
reflector for the R-mode operation, as Fig. 1(a) shows. A polarizer 
and a quarter wave film of the RLCD provide the normally black 
operation of the LC-mode which, in the meantime, improves the 
A-CR of the T-mode. In such a design, the polarizer of the RLCD 
filters one half of the output light from the OLED and decreases 
the transmittance of the T-mode.  
In a transflective LCD, the T-mode has much better performances 
in contrast ratio, color saturation, and viewing angle than R-mode 
because of surface reflections. Therefore, T-mode is used more 
frequently than R-mode. Hence, high transmittance is required for 
the T-mode operation in order to keep high brightness, high CR 
and saturated colors for low and medium ambient. On the other 
hand, the R-mode is still necessary to retain good readability 
under strong ambient, e.g. outdoor or direct sunlight.

In this paper, we propose to place a transparent OLED (TOLED) 
on top of the RLCD as Fig. 1(b) shows in order to decrease the 
optical loss from the RLCD. In theory, the transmittance should 
increase by 50% provided that the OLED emission is Lambertian. 
Due to the micro-cavity effect in such a device, the forward- and 
backward- emission can be engineered by varying the layer 
structure of the TOLED which improves the transmittance by 
57.3% in our new device structure.
