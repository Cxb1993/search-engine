Properties of conjugated polymer 
aggregates in the precursor solution and the 
performance of optoelectronic devices are 
highly correlated. The so-called “memory 
effect” implies that chain conformation in 
solution may, to some extent, be transferred 
into a dried thin film.3 Thus, many studies 
have since focused on the aggregation 
properties in the solution state. 
Spectroscopy characterizations, for instance, 
have been utilized to probe segmental 
association,4-5 and light scattering and 
small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) 
studies have supplemented dynamic and 
structural features of interchain 
aggregates.6-8 
This research aims at combining DLS, 
SLS, and PL measurements, and providing a 
multiscale characterization of MEH-PPV 
solutions. DLS yields the apparent 
hydrodynamic radius roughly from 1~5,000 
nm and is particularly sensitive to the 
presence of huge aggregates, whereas SLS 
yields the mean aggregate size generally 
below 100 nm. Complementary to DLS and 
SLS, PL provides information on segmental 
association and, in particular, can be utilized 
to verify the results suggested by light 
scatterings. 
On the other hand, in binary colloidal 
solution system, the entropic depletion 
forces caused by the presence of small 
particles have an important impact on the 
colloidal stabilization and phase behavior.9 
Such forces, however, are difficult to 
formulate analytically, and classic theories 
work at best qualitatively.9-10 Therefore, we 
have performed Brownian dynamics 
simulations to explore the depletion 
potentials between large particles with 
varying size and volume fraction of the 
small particle.  
 
III. Experiments and Simulation Method 
Materials. The MEH-PPV samples were 
purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co., with 
the number-average molecular weight ca. 
70,000-100,000 Da and a polydispersity of 
ca. 2. The polymer solutions with 
concentration of 0.5, 1, and 3 mg/mL were 
prepared by sonicating 10 h/day at 50°C for 
four days. Before the first-run light 
scattering measurements, the sample 
solutions were filtered with a 450 nm filter. 
The solutions were then stored in an autodry 
box for one week for the subsequent 
investigation of the effects of aging and 
thermal treatment. Before the second-run 
light scattering measurements, the sample 
solutions were sonicated for 1 h. All 
measurements were conducted at 25°C. 
Simulations. Three simulation systems 
were investigated: a two-body system, a 
many-body system, and a mean-field system, 
as depicted in Fig. 1. Particle interactions 
are all assumed to be hard-sphere repulsions. 
For the two-body system, a pair of large 
colloids is constrained in one dimension, 
and the depletion potential between them is 
obtained by Boltzmann inversion of the pair 
distribution function g(r). For the 
many-body system, the same methodology 
is adopted, yet with several large colloids 
included in a usual 3D system. For the 
mean-field system, the depletion potentials 
obtained for the previous systems are used 
medium-sized aggregates in M/C remains 
largely unchanged. 
Brownian Dynamics Simulations of the 
Depletion Effect in Binary Colloid System 
The depletion forces are investigated with 
varying volume fraction and size ratio, as 
shown in Fig. 5. Two general trends can be 
noted: With increased volume fraction or 
decreased size ratio, the depletion force 
becomes more pronounced, especially in 
view of the well depth. Moreover, a small 
region showing net repulsions in the 
depletion potential can be seen in both cases, 
especially for volume fractions of the small 
particles above 0.23. Figure 6 compares the 
depletion potentials obtained from the 
two-body and many-body systems, 
respectively. The good agreement found is 
suggestive of the unimportance of 
hydrodynamic interactions and the 
dimensionality of the simulation system. 
Figures 7a-7b indicate that the mean-field 
potential works pretty well in capturing the 
structural features compared with those 
obtained from the many-body system. In 
contrast, Figures 7c-7d reveal that the 
dynamic properties are poorly described, 
suggestive of the importance to rescale the 
frictional drag of the large particle due to 
the presence of small particles. After such 
corrections have been made, the results 
(note shown) were noted to improve 
considerably. Thus, the mean-field system 
seems to provide an ideal alternative by 
which large-scale colloidal properties may 
be simulated more efficiently.

although the DE or K-BKZ theory can, in general, predict the stress relaxation data
following the second strain, their applicability is limited to cases in which t− t1k,
where k is the time-strain separability time indicative of complete chain retraction. Until
more recently, the influence of the chain retraction process was systematically explored
by Venerus and Kahvand 1994 for cases where t− t1k. They pointed out that chain
retraction plays an important role in both non-reversing and reversing flows. The simu-
lation work by Hua et al. 1998 later confirmed the experimental trends noted in the
previous experiment.
As entangled chains were subjected to a prior flow history, the entanglement structure
could differ from that at equilibrium due to an imbalance between the formation of new
entanglements and destruction of old ones via flow convection Marrucci 1996; Ian-
niruberto and Marrucci 1996. Thus, a better understanding about the impact of the
transient entanglement structure is essential if one wishes to more accurately describe the
chain dynamics and associated rheological properties in fast flows. Earlier, it has exten-
sively been reported that the entanglement density of polymers does not remain constant
in continuous flows or during stress relaxation processes. Archer 1999a proposed a
procedure by using a small step shear immediately after the cessation of steady shear
flows to investigate the variation in the transient entanglement density for a series of
entangled polystyrene PS solutions. It was observed that the effective elastic modulus as
probed by a later imposed step strain decreases with an increasing rate of the prior
shearing, suggesting a lower entanglement density under a higher shear rate. Subse-
quently, Islam and Archer 2001 performed flow birefringence and rheological measure-
ments to corroborate the impact of polymer entanglement density during transient and
steady shear flows. Robertson et al. 2004 studied the re-entanglement kinetics after the
cessation of steady shear flows for polybutadiene solutions. They found that an identical
stress overshoot curve can be reached only when the rest period between the cessation
and the resumption of steady shear flows is greater than several disengagement times.
Isono et al. 1995 reported that for polyisobutylene Isono and Ferry 1985; Isono et al.
1991 or polybutadiene Isono and co-workers 1995, 1997 melts, the change in the
entanglement structure immediately after single- or double-step strain flows may be
probed by later superposing a small oscillatory deformation to the sample fluids. The
differential storage modulus G , , t thus measured slowly recovers to the value in
pure small-amplitude oscillatory flows, reminiscent of an effect of transient entanglement
structure. On the other hand, the simulation conducted by Hua and Yang 2002 indicated
a notable entanglement density reduction under both transient and steady shearing/
elongation. Overall, these studies have consistently revealed a generally close relation-
ship between material deformation and transient entanglement structure for entangled
polymer liquids.
It appears to us, however, that no earlier experimental studies have conducted a direct
assessment of the mean segmental stretch under controlled flow history, especially in
view of the impact of varying transient entanglement property. Knowledge so obtained
has an intimate implication in the interpretation of rheological data and in the construc-
tion of effective constitutive equations describing the average chain stretch. In the present
study, double-step strain flows on two representative concentrated entangled solutions
were employed to appraise the behavior of chain stretch and its relaxation with varying
transient entanglement property achieved with specially designed protocols for imposing
the first and the second strains. On the basis of an extended DE theory for double-step
strain flows, the phenomenological stretch relaxation function following the imposition
of a second large probe strain has been systematically evaluated. Anomalous imposition-
time dependences of the stretch function found for the cases with two consecutive large

rial properties of the sample solutions retrieved from linear viscoelastic data are compiled
in Table I. Note that there is a wide separation between the Rouse time and the reptation
time for both sample solutions. This feature is very important for the present experimen-
tal protocol to differentiate the impact of transient entanglement structure, as we describe
later. Table II provides the discrete relaxation times i and moduli Gi obtained from a
simplex optimization method, which are capable of simultaneously fitting both dynamic
moduli and linear relaxation modulus for each sample solution. In single or double-step
strain flows, the gap between the cone and the plate was precisely controlled so that the

converse trend was observed for reversing flows shown in Figs. 8a–8c. The similarity
as well as disparity noted with the two types of double-step strain flows will be discussed
momentarily.
To systematically analyze the data shown in Figs. 5–8, we first consider the original
DE theory for double-step strain flows without the IA assumption Doi and Edwards

where A and  are as defined in the original paper of Doi 1980a. An important
spirit of Eq. 3 is that the stress relaxation in the double-step strain experiment can be
evaluated on the basis of the data collected in the single-step strain experiment. To further

account for the effect of chain stretch, as omitted in Eq. 3, we consider the following
extension of the DE model for double-step strain flows:

the stretch function 2t− t1 is basically independent of the direction of imposing the
second strain, and hence the essential trends currently noted could be universal for en-
tangled solutions. Our tentative interpretation of this phenomenon is as follows. The
imposition time of the second strain t1 /R=3−12 is close to the estimated time for
principal chain retraction approximately t4.5R according to Osaki et al. 1982, yet
substantially shorter than the reptation time at which orientation relaxation formally
commences. At an imposition time close to t13R, one would therefore anticipate a
transient minimum in the average entanglement density due to the entanglement loss
caused by prior chain retraction. Further increasing t1 leads to a progressive recovery of
the equilibrium entanglement density via the early-stage chain reptation and/or chain-

pronounced deviation seen in Fig. 10 for reversing flows. Recall that the long-time
damping function has exhibited a different type of deviation from the single-step strain
result in the two types of double-step strain flows. Considering a greater stress that
remains at a shorter imposition time t1 due to a less degree of orientation relaxation
and/or a larger residue chain stretch, the second strain in non-reversing flows would
better superpose the first one and thus lead to a more positive deviation in the long-time
damping function, as observed in Fig. 6. The converse trend can be expected for revers-
ing flows, as seen in Fig. 8. Thus, it could be a combination of both effects—transient
entanglement loss and remaining stress—that happen to act in the same direction in
reversing flows and, consequently, result in a more pronounced modification in the stretch
function than for non-reversing flows.
From a virtually distinct perspective, Wang and co-workers 2006, 2007 recently
reported, mainly for polybutadiene melts or solutions, that the transient entanglement
breakup due to force imbalance of mutually entangled strands prevails in transient or
steady flows. Presumably, any reduction in transient entanglement density due to the
usual Rouse retraction—as we have considered here—or due to the transient force im-
balance, as suggested by Wang and co-workers 2006, 2007, might result in a similar
response in the stretch function.
Finally, the significance of the experimental trends discussed above may also be per-
ceived by noting that existing molecular theories or constitutive equations for entangled
polymers typically ignored the effects of transient entanglement properties in modeling
the average chain stretch. More specifically, chain stretch has commonly been formulated
as a function of the instantaneous chain stretch and orientation state alone, although some
theories indeed took into account, only in an implicit manner, an enhanced chain retrac-
tion due to constraint releases. From this standpoint, the present study appears to suggest
that a more accurate description of nonlinear rheological properties of entangled polymer
liquids must also rely on the ability to monitor the transient entangled state as well as to
properly account for its impact on the chain stretch and the subsequent relaxation.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
Double-step strain flow experiments both non-reversing and reversing on two repre-
sentative PS solutions with specially designed protocols for imposing the first and the
second strains were employed to study the phenomenological chain stretch and its relax-
ation under the influence of varying transient entanglement property. Specifically, the
imposition times of the second strain t1 have been so chosen i.e., t1 /R=3−12 that the
subsequent stress relaxation was anticipated to be largely unaffected by prior chain
stretch i.e., t1R or orientation relaxation i.e., t1d, thereby providing a unique
opportunity for one to appraise the impact of transient entanglement structure on the
average chain stretch and its relaxation. Independent of the direction of imposing the
second strain, the same type of deviation in the stretch function with varying t1 has been
identified for the cases with two consecutive large strains. Compared with single-step
strain result, the maximum mean-square segmental stretch was noted to reduce by as
much as 33% and 48% for non-reversing and reversing flows, respectively, with a probe
strain 2=7. These essential rheological features were interpreted by noting that the bulk
flow becomes less effective in stretching individual chains under a smaller transient
entanglement density, as marked by a smaller value of t1 in the indicated regime. On the
other hand, influences from a varying degree of orientation relaxation or residue chain
stretch for the range of t1 considered were argued to play—at best—minor roles in
affecting the stretch function, although they might be responsible for a relatively more

of simulating real large-scale material properties such as
aggregation properties. This is especially so for the case of a
solution system, for which the cost of simulating the generally
uninteresting solvent molecules could be prohibitively high. For
this reason, some earlier CG simulations18,19,26 have taken the
advantage of using Langevin dynamics schemes for simulating

they were properly selected by a standard rejection-acceptance algorithm to ensure the same distribution as the respective P(θ). Independence may
then be claimed when the value of I is comparable with the associated error bar, as is approximately satisfied in all three cases.

single-chain or aggregation state underlying the spectroscopic
features of the solution is difficult to know in general. Other
experimental protocols which probe the material properties at
larger scales, such as viscometric or light-scattering character-
izations, suffer from similar restrictions in resolving the detailed
structural features.
Current attempts to understand the molecular properties of
MEH-PPV may grossly be depicted in Figure 2, where early
simulations and experimental characterizations are classified
according to the relevant length/time scales probed. In particular,
the marked portion represents the molecular scales aimed to be
captured in this simulation. It can be seen that the material
properties studied here are of interest in a wide variety of
experimental characterizations on semiconducting polymers,
including SANS/SAXS measurements, UV-vis/PL character-
izations and dynamic/static light scatterings, and are largely
beyondthescopeofearlysimulationsofMEH-PPVmolecules.11-15
Next, we introduce the essential steps for constructing a plausible
CG model and a self-consistent Langevin dynamics scheme for
MEH-PPV solutions.
Two different representations of a MEH-PPV oligomer are
shown in Figure 1. Model I resembles the usual atomistic model,
except that all hydrogen atoms have been lumped into their
mother carbon atoms. Model II presents three potential candi-
dates for the present CG model, by treating each repeating unit
(or monomer) as one particle or “bead”. In principle, selection
among these CG models is to achieve the best compromise
between capturing the essential molecular details and compu-
tational convenience.17 It came to our notice, however, that the
presence of a large dangling side-chain group in the MEH-PPV
monomer makes the CG model adopting the mass center of the
whole monomer (i.e., filled squares) an inadequate choice.
The reason is that the relatively free positioning fluctuations of
the large side-chain group result in an apparent mobility of the
CG particle, and consequently lead to spurious flexibilities in
the CG bond length and angles (in this case, the predicted
persistence length was noted to be about half of that based on
the other two CG models). This observation, in fact, poses an
important general consideration in the CG simulation of a
polymer chain with large side-chain groups. On the other hand,
the predicted single-chain properties, including persistence
length and radius of gyration, based on the other two CG models
are in excellent agreement, and the one which centers the CG
bead at the geometrical center of the phenyl ring (i.e., filled
circles) is adopted for its better consistency with the later
modeling of intermolecular potential.
Possessing a pair of asymmetric alkoxy side chains and an
aromatic backbone has made MEH-PPV an amphiphilic poly-
mer, leading to a rich variety of chain conformations and
supramolecular aggregations in solution. For some special
applications, such as mixing aliphatic/aromatic solvent systems,
it might be necessary to treat the two side chains as independent
beads in the CG model. Besides, the planar phenyl ring of each
MEH-PPV monomer provides the essential local π-π interac-
tions often believed to be an important source of polymer
aggregation. Although the aforementioned features could be
among the important considerations in constructing a CG model
for MEH-PPV, we here adopt a more standard CG model with
the beads placed at the geometrical center of the phenyl rings
(i.e., filled circles of Figure 1a, model II). For a MEH-PPV chain
as long as presently studied (i.e., Mn ≈ 80 000 Da or 300
monomers per chain), π-π interactions that are necessary for
a more precise account of the local structural feature might
further be coarse-grained in computing large-scale material
properties that are of primary interest in this study. On the other
hand, typical synthesized defects, such as the cis and tetrahedral
defects, make the planar and rodlike structure associated with
an ideal, all-trans MEH-PPV practically inaccessible, leading
to a rich variety of chain conformations in various solvents.
Since the actual amount and distribution of these defects are
difficult to know in practice, this study focuses on model MEH-
PPV chains with an alternating cis-trans conformation (see
sketches in Figure 1b). While conserving a fully conjugated
configuration, the cis conformation was noticed to result in a
slight tilting of two adjacent phenyl rings as the favorable
equilibrium state, thus breaking up the planar feature of ideal
MEH-PPV molecules.12 The resultant chain conformation
thereby allows for a systematical exploration of the collapsed
chain conformation under varying solvent quality.13,14 As we
shall show, the persistence lengths so obtained are in close
agreement with recent experimental estimations, suggesting that
the impact of synthesized defects is reasonably captured. In
general, it will be demonstrated that the present CG model is
capable of capturing essential material properties of MEH-PPV
in two representative solvent systems as implied by recent
experimental observations and simulation results. Investigation
based on a different CG model for mixed solvent systems is
left to a future work. In what follows, we describe how the
simulation results based on model I may be utilized to
reconstruct the force fields and the Langevin dynamics for the
CG model chosen for model II (circles), which will be employed
to compute all the single-chain and aggregation properties
presented in this work.
3. Model Construction and Simulation Protocol
The MD simulation of model I was carried out using usual
Newton’s equations of motion. The calculations were performed
in a supercomputer with four CPUs running in parallel; an
existing software package DLPOLY232 and incorporated force
fields33 were used. The simulation results were mainly utilized
to provide essential statistical trajectories for the bond length
and angles as redefined in the CG model (i.e., model II). To
ensure that the data collected for model I well represent the
equilibrium distributions for local bond length and angles, the
initial chain conformations for model I were created and
subsequently equilibrated with the aid of a Monte Carlo scheme.
The computed statistical trajectories, after the Jacobian
correction,20,24 for the bond length and two bond angles,
respectively, are shown in Figure 3 along with their Boltzmann-
inverted potentials:
U(z))-kBT ln P(z) (1)
where kBT is the Boltzmann constant times the absolute
temperature, and P(z) is the probability distribution function of
the variable z (i.e., bond length or angle) defined in the CG
model. A fundamental requirement that must be fulfilled here
is that any variable chosen for z must be independent
variable17,20,24 (see also the footnotes of Figure 1). Parts a-c
of Figure 3 compare the predictions of the CG model with those
of model I; parts d-f of Figure 3 show the analytical fitting of
the inverted potential functions that were later employed by the
CG model, with the parameters determined by using an
automatic simplex optimization. Excellent agreement has been
achieved between atomistic MD and CG simulation data, which
should guarantee that the chain conformation and associated
structural and dynamic properties are well captured in subse-
quent CG simulations. The functional forms, model parameters,
11482 J. Phys. Chem. B, Vol. 112, No. 37, 2008 Lee et al.
Langevin dynamics of the CG model is constructed using the
predictions of the atomistic model for single-particle diffusivi-
ties. As an important consequence, much longer MEH-PPV
chains (Mn ≈ 80 000 Da) and their supramolecular aggregates
as well as real times (up to several hundred nanoseconds) can
be simulated in a single-CPU personal computer. Simulation
results so obtained have interesting implications for understand-
ing the solution properties of MEH-PPV, as we discuss later.
We begin with the Langevin equation of motion for a usual
Brownian particle without hydrodynamic interactions:
mi
d2ri
dt2
)-ςi
dri
dt +∑j Fij + i (3)
where mi and ri are the mass and positional vector of the ith
bead on a certain polymer chain, respectively, ∑j Fij and i are
the sum of the conservative forces (i.e., the intra- and intermo-
lecular forces) and the random force, respectively, acting on
the same bead, and ςi (sometimes defined as miςi)34 is the
frictional drag coefficient. Because the relationship between the
random Brownian force and the mean-field frictional drag
coefficient must be dictated by the fluctuation-dissipation
theorem, generally given in form of the Einstein relation, ςi )
kBT/Di, it is possible to estimate the frictional drag coefficient,
ςi, using the predicted particle diffusivity, Di, from the atomistic
MD simulation for a given solvent. Then, the following
expression of Brownian forces with a Gaussian statistics can
be constructed:
〈i〉) 0 and 〈i(t)j(t)〉) 2ςikBTδijI (4)
In eq 4, the broken brackets denote taking the ensemble average
of the quantity within them, I is a unit tensor, and δij is the
Kronecker delta function.
Several things must be noted here. First, although the polymer
particle described in this CG model might not be treated as a
usual Brownian particle, whose mass should be sufficiently
larger than those of surrounding solvent particles, it will be
shown that the Einstein relation and the Brownian forces so
constructed seem to lead to results in good agreement with what
directly obtained from the MD simulation of the CG model.
On the other hand, the commonly employed extensionsthe
Einstein-Stokes lawswhich involves using the bulk solvent
viscosity to estimate the particle diffusivities, fails evidently in
the current level of coarse-graining, as might be expected. Note
also that it has not been uncommon using similar Langevin
dynamic equations to simulate polymer solution or melt systems
at a similar level of coarse-graining.18,19,26 The major difference
is that the frictional drag coefficient has typically been treated
as adjustable and, hence, lacks a definite link with the prediction
of the atomistic model. In summary, it appears that the Einstein
relation remains applicable even for a CG particle as small as
a polymer monomer. By contrast, the subsequent extensionsthe
Einstein-Stokes lawsis subject to the restriction of continuum
mechanics. This issue will be revisited in the next section, as
the simulation results of the center-of-mass chain diffusivities
are examined against the previous law.
From the MD simulation of model I, the diffusivities of MEH-
PPV monomer in toluene and in chloroform have been estimated
to be DMT ) 2.83 × 10-9 and DMC ) 7.47 × 10-9 m2/s,
respectively, at T ) 298 K and 1 atm. Accordingly, one obtains
ςMT ) kBT/DMT ) 1.45 × 10-12 kg/s and ςMC ) kBT/DMC )
0.55 × 10-12 kg/s as the effective drag coefficients, respectively.
To this end, the Langevin dynamics of a MEH-PPV chain may
be tracked by using eqs 3 and 4 along with the intra- and
intermolecular potentials obtained earlier.
Table 2 compares the predicted single-chain diffusivity and
radius of gyration, respectively, for the CG model using two
different simulation methodologies. It is readily evident that the
Langevin dynamics simulation is capable of capturing the results
of the MD simulation on both the dynamic and the structural
properties of a single MEH-PPV chain in two different solvent
systems. Moreover, for the results shown in Table 2, it takes
ca. 36 h of the MD simulation with four CPUs running in
parallel, while it requires only about ten minutes for the
Langevin dynamics simulation executed in a single-CPU
personal computer. In fact, only through the Langevin dynamics
simulation will it be possible for us to investigate polymer chain
lengths close to what typically studied in real experiment, and,
in particular, to gain some insight into the properties of
supramolecular aggregates formed by several MEH-PPV chains
of comparable length.
In simulating eq 3, the Velocity Verlet algorithm34 was used
with a time step of 8 fs (see a later discussion). As is usually
done, periodic boundary conditions were applied in all three
spatial directions. Initially, a Monte Carlo scheme34,35 was used
to create independent MEH-PPV chains with minimum con-
figuration energies. Each chain was further equilibrated for a
number of steps ca. 3 × 105, which warrants equilibrations of
local bond length and angles and facilitates a fast equilibration
in the overall chain configuration in subsequent MD simulations.
For the results reported in the next section, the simulated MEH-
PPV chain typically consists of 300 monomers per chain (or
Mn ≈ 80 000 Da), which falls in the regime of the sample
molecular weights as typically investigated in experiments.9,11
Before closing the introduction of the simulation protocol,
we would like to add a few remarks. In the spirit of the proposed
Langevin dynamics scheme, the effect of solvent quality might
be regarded as being self-consistently accounted for via the
balance between the fluctuation-dissipation forces (i.e., the
frictional drag force and the Brownian force) and the conserva-
tive forces (i.e., the intra- and intermolecular forces). This is,
in fact, an interesting feature in the present simulation of a
polymer solution, and is to be contrasted with typical Langevin
dynamics simulations in which a specific solvent quality was
mimicked by independently adjusting the parameters of inter-
molecular forces.18,19,36,37 On the other hand, the effect of
hydrodynamic interactions, which are omitted in this work yet
are expected to have certain influences on the dynamic and even
structural properties, remains to be explored in a future study.
Generally speaking, this specific effect might be essential for a
precise setting of the real time of the simulation,18 as well as

carried out in a parallel computation system (IBM-P690 with 4
CPUs) using the software DLPOLY2, and the total computation
time was ca. 36 h. The CGLD simulation was performed in a
single-CPU personal computer using eqs 3 and 4, and the total
computation time was ca. 10 min.
11484 J. Phys. Chem. B, Vol. 112, No. 37, 2008 Lee et al.
becomes accessible in this simulation. Figure 6 shows the
predicted radius of gyration and end-to-end distance, respec-
tively, for single MEH-PPV chains in toluene or in chloroform.
In general, one sees that the coil size of MEH-PPV is larger in
chloroform than in toluene (i.e., Rg,MC ) 43.7 ( 0.5 Å and Rg,MT
) 34.4 ( 0.7 Å). The observed effects of solvent were in
qualitative agreement with an early experimental result based
on fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.13 In particular, the
scaling exponents (0.32 ( 0.02 in toluene and 0.38 ( 0.01 in
chloroform at T ) 298 K) retrieved from the plots shown in
Figure 7 clearly indicate that both solution systems fall well
below the so-called Θ-condition (which bears a theoretical
exponent 0.5), yet chloroform has a better solvent quality than
toluene. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that
the exact solvent qualities for MEH-PPV solutions at a given
temperature have been reported in terms of fundamental scaling
laws for the coil size. In fact, a better solvent quality found for
the chloroform system is in agreement with the common
experience that MEH-PPV dissolves more readily in chloroform
than in toluene. On the other hand, spectroscopic observations
generally indicated that the adsorption or light emission curves
of MEH-PPV solutions were more red-shifted when an aromatic
solvent was used.4 Recent SANS observations also suggested
that MEH-PPV bears a higher degree of aggregation in toluene
than in chloroform.10 Both phenomena imply that the aggrega-
tion properties of MEH-PPV solutions are closely correlated
with the solvent qualities here explored, as we comment later.
Another fundamental chain property that is usually of
interest is the persistence or Kuhn length, which yields
information about the stiffness of a polymer chain. The
persistence length, denoted as LP, of a homopolymer is
estimated using the following relation:40
Lp )∑
kgj
〈Qj · Qka 〉 (5)
where Q and a are the bond vector and bond length, respectively,
and the indices j, k sum over all segments of the same chain.
We noticed, however, that persistence length has customarily
been estimated using a formula which essentially utilizes the
chain contour length to replace the Kuhn chain length.12,41 Such
a treatment will result in a somewhat smaller persistence length.
Currently, the persistence length of MEH-PPV is estimated to
be 65.1 ( 11.8 Å in toluene and 73.3 ( 12.5 Å in chloroform,
which correspond to the mean end-to-end distance of about 25
MEH-PPV monomers (or, equivalently, there are 50 MEH-PPV
monomers in a Kuhn segment). These results are in close
agreement with light scattering data, ca. 60 Å in p-xylene,41
and a recent SANS estimation, ca. 87.5 Å in chloroform.10 Note
that the persistence length might be sensitively affected by the
amount and distribution of the synthesized defects.12 In contrast,
our observations suggested that the solvent qualities determined
earlier are relatively insensitive to the detailed chain conforma-
tion. The reason could be that the solvent-quality dependence
of the coil size is basically controlled by the interactions between
the polymer and solvent molecules as long as the chain length
stays sufficiently large with respect to the Kuhn length. For
comparison, we mention that early MD simulation42 and SANS
measurement43 have yielded the persistence lengths for two
typical flexible polymers, i.e., polyethylene (PE) and polystyrene
(PS), as 4.7 and 9.2 Å, respectively. The semiflexible feature
of the MEH-PPV molecule is thus evident.
In addition to the structural features discussed above,
knowledge of the dynamic properties of single MEH-PPV chains
in solution helps understand the aggregation property.11 For a
similar reason, the dynamic properties of single MEH-PPV
chains are difficult to retrieve from real experiments because
of the problem of chain aggregation. From the time-dependent
mean-square chain displacement at long times, the center-of-
mass diffusivities of MEH-PPV were estimated to be DG, MT )
7.51 × 10-11 m2/s and DG,MC ) 9.62 × 10-11 m2/s, respectively.
Note that determination of a dynamic quantity in a CG
simulation would require a known relationship between the CG
time scale and that in the atomistic simulation. There are, in
principle, several ways to gain such information.24 Here, the
unknown time shift has been determined by fitting the CG
simulation data with the atomistic simulation data on the
autocorrelation function of the end-to-end vector of a MEH-
PPV oligomer (i.e., with 6 monomer units).
Comparing these results of chain diffusivity with those
obtained earlier for the monomer diffusivity, i.e., DMT ) 2.83
× 10-9 m2/s and DMC ) 7.47 × 10-9 m2/s, one sees that the
disparity in the monomer mobility smears off in the correspond-
ing full-chain diffusivity. The significance of this phenomenon
is 2-fold. First, it indicates how the dynamic behavior of a small
molecule or oligomer would, in general, be governed by the
chemical affinity or intermolecular interactions with the solvent
molecules. With increasing chain length, however, the whole
chain behaves like a macromolecule, whose dynamic properties
are primarily dictated by the mean-field drag or the solvent
viscosity. Given that the viscosities are nearly identical for the
two solvents considered, it might be expected that the center-
of-mass chain diffusivities should stay similar, as observed here.
On the other hand, the remaining disparity, which conflicts even
qualitatively with the prediction of the Einstein-Stokes law, is
reminiscent of an effect of solvent quality on single-chain
dynamic properties.39
4.2. Dynamics and Structures of Supramolecular Ag-
gregation. One of the main objectives of this work is to gain
some insight into the supramolecular aggregation properties of
MEH-PPV in solution, as well as to understand the impact of
solvent quality. As mentioned earlier, various experimental
protocols have been utilized to characterize the aggregation
properties of MEH-PPV solutions. However, the information
obtained was mostly qualitative, and the detailed aggregation
structure or the kinetics of its formation was typically unknown.
Although practically accessible aggregation features remain

using freely adjustable parameters, from the measured monomer
diffusivity in a given solvent through the atomistic MD
simulation. Besides, it was noticed that the presence of a large
dangling side-chain group of MEH-PPV requires a special
consideration in selecting a plausible CG particle. It was
demonstrated that the effect of solvent quality on the structural
features can well be captured, and the chain dynamics was also
naturally retained. As an important consequence, it became
possible to investigate single-chain and supramolecular ag-
gregation properties that were otherwise inaccessible by usual
CG simulations or real experiments.
Chemical amphiphicility and the hairy-rod feature have
made MEH-PPV an interesting polymer for studying, with
strong practical motivations, the solvent dependences of the
single-chain and supramolecular aggregation structures in
solution. Thus, two distinct solvent systems (i.e., aromatic
or aliphatic) have been examined using the proposed CG
simulation, and the major achievements were as follows: The
simulation on single-chain properties yielded, for the first
time, the scaling exponents (i.e., 0.32 in toluene and 0.38 in
chloroform at T ) 298 K) characterizing the exact solvent
qualities, confirming a generally poor solvent quality for
MEH-PPV solutions. The relative coil size was a clear
indication of the overall solvent quality of a particular
solution system. Specifically, it was found that an aliphatic
solventschloroform, which is relatively attractive to the side-
chain (but not to the backbone) units of MEH-PPV, turned
out to result in an overall better solvent quality and, hence,
a larger coil size in solution. Moreover, the persistence
lengths for both solvent systems were estimated to be Lp ≈
70 Å (which corresponds to about the mean end-to-end
distance of 25 MEH-PPV monomers), in close agreement
with recent neutron/light scattering data. On the other hand,
preliminary observations on supramolecular aggregation
properties suggested that the aggregation structure is con-
siderably more compact in toluenesa poorer solvent, despite
its superior affinity to the MEH-PPV backbone. This trend
was also in agreement with the general observations in recent
experiments, suggesting that the solvent quality determined
from single-chain data may as well be utilized to infer the
associated aggregation properties.
