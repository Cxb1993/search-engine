Abstract 
The ANSI S1.11 1/3-octave filter bank is popular in many acoustic applications because it matches the 
human hearing characteristics. However, the long group delay and the high computational complexity limit 
the usage in hearing aids. A Quasi-ANSI S1.11 18-band 1/3-octave filter bank is proposed to reduce the group 
delay. With the proposed matching error optimization method, the results show that the filter bank achieve 
comparable good matching between prescriptions and hearing aid response. The maximum matching error is 
only slight increase from 0dB to 1.5dB. Besides, the group delay is significantly reduced from 78ms to 10ms 
compared with the previously designed ANSI S1.11 1/3-octave filter bank. Based on the low-delay filter bank 
algorithm, the complexity-effective filter bank architecture is developed by exploiting the interpolated FIR 
and multirate processing techniques. Results shows that the proposed algorithm saves about 93% of 
multiplications and 74% of storage elements compared with a straightforward FIR filter bank. The low-delay 
complexity-effective 1/3-octave filter bank is implemented in UMC 90nm CMOS technology. The design 
consumes only 104μW, which is lower than other works in the literatures with group delay small then 10ms.

 第三年工作重點 
For better match the human hearing characteristics and the NAL-NL1 [1] prescription, the 1/3-octave 
band filter bank is desirable for hearing aids. However, the long group delay and the high computational 
complexity limit the usage of 1/3-octave filter bank in hearing aids. Researchers have shown that delay more 
than 15ms can cause disturbing perception for hearing aid users hearing their own voices [1]. When the delay 
becomes longer, the hearing impaired may notice an echo effect. And when even longer (more than 40 ms), 
the auditory information may out of synchronization with the visual information and disturb lip reading. 
Besides, the hearing aid is a portable device in which the power consumption is a critical concern. So, we 
must try our best to reduce the computational complexity in the constraint of delay and matching error. 
An 18-band 1/3-octave filter bank has been designed and implemented in [16]. This work adopts the 
ANSI S1.11 standard [2] base on the fact that the mostly used fitting formula NAL-NL1 prescribes the target 
gains on each 1/3-octave frequencies defined in the ANSI S1.11 standard. As a result, the hearing aid’s 
magnitude response can have the best capability to match any type of prescriptions by the use of ANSI S1.11 
1/3-octave filter bank. The work also makes use of the multistage IFIR and multi-rate techniques to largely 
reduce the computational complexity (in terms of number of the multiplications per input sample). The 
complexity-effective architecture saves about 96% of multiplications comparing that with a straightforward 
FIR filter bank. However, the price this work pay is the long group delay which is up to 78ms and will largely 
limit the usage of this design. We observe that the unacceptable long group delay is due to the very sharp 
transition in lower frequency part of ANSI S1.11 1/3-octave bands. Even using the straightforward FIR or IIR 
to implement the filter bank, there still have group delay up to 27 ms and this cannot be shortening further.

maximize the speech intelligibility. Furthermore, the overall signal processing delay and the power 
consumption is a critical issue for hearing aids as well as for the filter bank design. To the best of our 
knowledge, designing the filter bank for the digital hearing aids in the literature can be classified into two 
categories: uniform filter banks [9] ~ [12] and non-uniform filter banks [13] ~ [16].  
The uniform filter bank means that the bands are equally divided the frequencies from 0 to π. A 16-band 
discrete Fourier transform (DFT) filter bank is designed in [9], while an 8-band filter bank with equal-spaced 
finite-impulse response (FIR) filters is implemented in [10]. [11] and [12] exploit the interpolation 
finite-impulse response (IFIR) techniques to realize a 7-band and a 8-band uniform filter bank respectively. 
The drawback of uniform filter banks is that they do not match the non-uniform frequency characteristics in 
human auditory system. As a result, the uniform filter bank may face difficulties at matching the prescriptions 
for various types of hearing loss. Consequently, the using of non-uniform filter banks is more suitable. 
As depicted in Fig. 3-1, the common-used non-uniform filter banks can go a step further to classify into 
critical-band [13], symmetric-band [14][15], and 1/3-octave-band [16] filter banks. 
 
Figure 3-1  Different types of filter banks 
In order to provide the frequency characteristics similar to that of the human auditory system, a 
critical-band filter bank is designed in [13]. The critical bands are divided according to psychoacoustics and 
have good match to human perception. However, the irregular property of the critical bands makes the 
implementation difficult. The design in [13], for example, implements 16-band critical-like filter bank with 
rather high-order (110-tap) FIR filters, which has significant computation complexity. On the other hand, Lian 
and Wei proposed an 8-band and 16-band symmetric filter bank [14][15]. The symmetric filter bank is 
symmetric at π/2 and has higher frequency resolution at both high and low frequencies. With the IFIR and 
frequency-response masking (FRM) techniques, the computational complexity is largely reduced. However, 
these symmetric banks have relatively small number of bands at middle frequencies and may not have 
sufficient resolutions for hearing loss compensation.

四、 研究方法 
Design Considerations of Filter Banks in Hearing Aids  
1. Matching prescription capability 
The main task of hearing aid is to selectively compensate the hearing loss according to prescriptions such 
that make the sound audible and recognizable for hearing-impaired people. The auditory compensation system, 
especially the filter bank, has a great influence on the matching capability of a hearing aid, because the 
hearing aid is only able to adjust the gain on each sub-band signals. So, a filter bank with suitable spacing will 
be more flexible to adjust the magnitude response and have a better matching capability. In general, a sound 
change of 3dB SPL is just noticeable for human ear. To compensate the hearing loss properly, we can derive a 
necessary requirement that the maximum matching error of hearing aid’s frequency response to the 
prescriptive targets should keep smaller than 3dB. 
2. Digital signal processing delay (group delay) 
The group delay is a crucial issue in hearing aids. The superposition of processed signal and the bypass 
signal may provoke strong comb filter effects for long signal processing group delay and degrade the sound 
quality. Filter bank usually contributes the most group delay in the data path. But somehow it is the price that 
needs to pay to have a higher frequency resolution in the filter bank. And this cannot be shortening according 
to the acoustic uncertainty principle [17]. It says that if we want to have a good resolution in frequency 
domain, more input samples need to be referenced in time domain and so introduce more group delays. That 
is, the narrower the channels are, the larger the group delay will have. 
Considering other components in the data path (microphone, receiver, A/D, D/A) will contribute from 2 
to almost 5 ms group delay [18], we can derive the group delay specification for filter bank. The group delay 
of filter bank should not greater than 10ms. 
3. Signal processing complexity & power consumption 
Due to the limited battery size in hearing aids, power consumption plays an important role. Algorithmic 
complexity is directly related to the power consumption so we must try our best to minimize the computation 
complexity. Filter bank usually contributes the most computational load. Therefore, signal processing 
algorithms have to be realized as efficient as possible. 
Quasi-ANSI S1.11 1/3-Octave Specification 
The ANSI S1.11 standard is a specification for octave-band and fractional-octave-band analog and digital 
filters. This standard provides performance requirements for analog, sampled-data, and digital 
implementations of band-pass filters that comprise a filter set or spectrum analyzer for acoustical 
measurements. The extent of the pass-band region of a filter's relative attenuation characteristic is a constant 
percentage of the mid-band frequency for all filters. Furthermore, Figure 4- (a) illustrates the magnitude 
specification for the nth 1/3-octave band, where maxA(ω) and minA(ω) describe the detail limits on the 
maximum and minimum attenuation of nth filter respectively. As shown in Fig. 4-1, the pass-band ripple is 
allowed to be less than or equal to 1 dB, while the filter should have at least 60dB attenuation at frequencies 
higher than 24/3fm or lower than 2-4/3fm. 
 10
The development of quasi-ANSI S1.11 specification is conducted as follows. As depicted in Fig. 4-3(b), 
the magnitude response specification of maxA(ω) is kept unchanged. Then we stretch the minA(ω) 
specification by a factor k for the bands whose group delay are larger than 10 ms. The constraint on transition 
region will be released but the stop-band attenuation is still constrained to have more than 60dB and the 
pass-band ripple is still constrained to be less than 1dB. So, the limitation on the pass-band is without any 
degradation. The thing we do is to stretch the transition bandwidth specification such that the filter’s transition 
slope is flatter and reduce the group delay to below 10ms. Then an exploration method will be described in 
Section 3.2. We propose an algorithm to explore the feasible solutions such that the filter meets the 
specification and the filter order is minimized. A matching error optimization method is developed and 
described in Section 3.3. By finding the optimal insertion gains of each band, we can minimize the maximum 
matching error between the hearing aid response and the prescriptions.

Filter Coefficient Design 
To reduce the group delay as well as the computational complexity in filter, the orders of each filter 
should be determined as small as possible. We apply the widely-used Parks-McClellan algorithm to design the 
coefficients of each filter. Parks-McClellan algorithm is an optimum equiripple FIR design method [19]. The 
design parameters δp, δs, fs1, fs2, fp1, and fp2 of the band-pass filter are depicted in Fig. 4-4 where δp and δs 
are pass-band ripple and stop-band attenuation respectively. fs1 and fs2 are stop-band bandage frequencies. 
fp1 and fp2 are pass-band bandage frequencies.

where the amplitude of the mth prescribed gain is represented by Pm where m = 1, 2, 3, …, 18. Similarly 
define the amplitude response of filter bank as An,m where represent the amplitude of nth band at the frequency 
of mth prescribed gain. Let Gn denotes the amplitude of nth insertion gain. Then ΣAn,mGn represent the 
amplitude at the frequency of mth prescribed gains. So, we can derive the mth matching error Em to the mth 
prescribed gain. Secondly, by using the minimization function called fmincon in MATLAB, we can find the 
optimal insertion gains Gn such that the maximum matching error of Em is minimal. The syntax of fmincon is 
[G, error] = fmincon(objfun, xs, LB, UB), where objfun is the objective function and equal to max(Em) and Em 
is the matching error of mth prescribed gain. The initial condition value of insertion gains can be assigned by 
setting the xs. We set the initial value of insertion gains as prescribed gains. The LB and UB represent the 
lower and upper bound of insertion gains. Finally, the optimized insertion gains for each sub-band can be 
found and save to G. The error is save the maximum error to all prescribed gains. 
Matching Result 
We evaluate the group delay and the maximum matching error with respect to different stretch factor k as 
reported in Table 4-1. With the increasing stretch factor k, the transition bandwidth increase gradually and the 
group delay decreases from 27.3 ms to 9.4 ms. Notice that when the stretch factor goes from 1.2 to 1.4, the 
group delay is unchanged. This is because when the stretch factor is larger then 1.2, the stop-band frequency 
of the lowest-frequency band intersects the zero point. We only can stretch the transition bandwidth when the 
stop-band frequency is a positive value. Besides, the maximum matching error of prescribed targets increases 
from 0.8 dB to 7.1 dB. But after applying the matching-error optimization method, matching error only 
increase from 0dB to 2dB. Note that a feasible solution is found for stretch factor k larger than 0.8. The filter 
bank satisfy the group delay (smaller than 10 ms) and maximum error (smaller then 3dB) constraint.

Figure 5-1 IFIR implementation of H(z) (frequency domain) 
The basic IFIR structure can be composed of an image suppression filter I(z) and a model filter G(z) 
where L is the interpolation factor. IFIR filter is to implement the filter H(z) as a cascade of two FIR sections 
which are I(z) and G(zL) as described in Fig. 5-1. G(zL) is produced from G(z). The impulse response of G(zL) 
is formed by interpolating the impulse response of G(z) by a factor L and padded with zero. Fig. 5-2 illustrates 
the relationship between G(z), G(zL), I(z) and H(z) in time domain for a interpolation factor of 2. From the 
view of hardware implementation, G(zL) is formed by using L storage elements to replace the original single 
storage element in G(z). Besides, I(z) is a image suppressor. In frequency domain analysis, G(zL) has a 
periodic frequency response at high frequencies called image terms with period 2π/L. The task of I(z) is to 
suppress the unwanted image terms of basic pass-band filter at higher frequencies. In time domain analysis, 
the meaning of the cascaded I(z) and G(zL) is that I(z) try to “fill in” the expected value of impulse response to 
G(zL) instead of “filling in” zero which will generates high frequency image, as described in Fig. 5-2.

In addition to the IFIR implementation method, we also exploit the multirate processing technique. 
Multirate means multiple data rates and it offers many advantages, such as reduced computational complexity 
for a given task, reduced transmission rate, and reduced storage requirement. Broadly speaking, if the filter is 
band-limit and its stop-band frequency is lower than π/M, we can down-sample the filter by a factor of M to 
reduce the data rate. The M is called decimation rate. Ones the data rate is reduced, the computational 
complexity (multiplications per sample) are reduced. The filter can process the input sample once upon every 
M sample. By the theory of multirate systems [20], a synthesis bank with up-sampler and interpolation filter is 
necessary. The task of interpolation filter is to suppress the image terms in higher frequencies after the signal 
is up-sampled. So, the price needs to pay is the cost of the interpolation filter in synthesis bank. The 
interpolation filter will contribute extra computational complexity. This is a trade-off between analysis bank 
and synthesis bank. When the decimation factor M increase, we have a lower data rate and can save more 
computational complexity in the analysis bank. But when the decimation factor M increase, we need an 
interpolation filter with narrower transition bandwidth and so have larger computational complexity in the 
synthesis bank. 
 18
With the increasing of the interpolation and down-sample factor, the computational complexity of G(z) will 
largely decrease at the beginning and the complexity of I(z) will increase gradually. Note that the IA(z) and the 
IS(z) are the same due to the same factor of interpolation and decimation. Finally, we can implement the filter 
with optimal IFIR and multirate structure. That is, when the factor is equal to 4, the filter will have minimum 
hardware complexity. The complexity comparison with the directly implementation method is shown in Table 
5-2. The number of multiplications per sample is saved by 88%. The number of storage elements which are 
used in delay line is saved by 73%. Now we use the IFIR and multirate implementation technique to realize 
the quasi-ANSI S1.11 filter bank. The optimal interpolation and down-sample factor of each band is shown in 
Fig. 5-6.

The final complexity-effective architecture of the analysis bank and the synthesis bank is depicted in Fig. 
5-6. Note that the factor is the same from band1 to band12 and the image suppressor can be shared to further 
reduce the computational complexity. Besides, the band12 will pose the strictest constraints on designing 
image suppressor among the twelve filters. So, we only need to consider the constraint of band12 when we 
design IA2 and IS2

attenuation in other works. Besides, the price the work [16] pay is the long group delay which is up to 78ms 
and it will largely limit the application of the design. Moreover, the synthesis bank in [16] will need a lot of 
memory to synchronize the delay between bands.

We re-implement the filter bank design of [16] (without the voltage scaling design) by using the UMC 
90nm high-Vt cell library. The comparison of maximum matching error, group delay and the power 
consumption (analysis bank + synthesis bank) is reported in Table 6-2. Compared with [16], the proposed 
1/3-octave filter bank has the advantages of low group delay and low power when take synthesis bank into 
considerations. There are only slight and acceptable degradation in matching capability. 
Discussion 
This report addresses the low-delay low-power filter bank design for advanced digital hearing aids. Due 
to the high group delay and the high computation complexity, the standard ANSI S1.11 1/3-octave bank is 
rarely adopted in the literatures, even though it has the advantage of good matching to the famous prescription 
formula NAL-NL1 and the human hearing characteristics. We develop a quasi-ANSI S1.11 1/3-octave filter 
bank design method to meet the group delay constraint. The group delay is largely reduced from 78ms to 
10ms compared with the ANSI S1.11 1/3-octave filter bank design in [16]. We also proposed an error 
minimization method such that the matching capability only has slight and acceptable degradation. The 
maximum matching error only slightly increases from 0dB to 1.5dB in worst case.  
Complexity-effective filter bank architecture is designed by using the IFIR and multirate technique. The 
implementation of 18-band quasi-ANSI S1.11 1/3-octave filter bank needs only 7% of multiplications and 
26% of storage elements of a straightforward parallel FIR filter bank. We also investigate and apply some 
lower-power VLSI techniques such as the clock gating and polyphase implementation to save the power 
consumption. The 18-band quasi-ANSI S1.11 1/3-octave filter bank has been implemented in UMC 90nm 
CMOS technology. The design consumes only 104μW for processing 18-band, 24 KHz audio signal. The 
proposed filter bank is 10ms-group-delay, low-power, and being able to precisely matching the prescribed 
gains generated by the widely used NAL-NL1 formula. 
Our future work is trying to further reduce the power consumption by any other optimizations. For 
example, we can achieve further power saving by applying voltage scaling technique for two reasons. Firstly,

適合助聽器的需求。此濾波器組採用 multirate 的架構以大幅降低
運算量，並且有一個系統化的流程來設計此濾波器 組的系數。此
濾波器組比起傳統設計只需要 4%運算量。另外，我們亦完成低功
耗硬體架構設計，並在 TSMC 0.13μm 製程下進行實作。根據模擬
的結果，此濾波器組在 24KHz 的取樣頻率下只消耗 77.33μW 的
功率，大約是文獻中其他用於助聽器濾波器組的 46% ~ 80%。 
（英文）A low-power ANSI S1.11 1/3-octave filter bank has been 
designed. Its power consumption is minimized through algorithmic, 
numerical and architectural optimization. The proposed filter bank 
adopts a multirate architecture to reduce data rates on the 
bandwidth-limited bands. A systematic coefficient design flow is also 
proposed to minimize the filter order thereof. The proposed design 
need only 4% multiplications and additions of a straightforward 
implementation. The proposed filter bank has been implemented in the
TSMC 0.13μm CMOS technology. Simulation result shows the design 
consumes 77.33μW for 24 KHz and 18-band audio signal processing. 
Compared with other filter bank designs, the proposed one consumes 
only 46% ~ 80% power dissipation.

點在法國、巴黎。會議中的討論主題包括（1）circuits and systems employing 
nanodevices (both extremely scaled CMOS and non-CMOS devices); (2) circuit 
fabrics (mixture of standard CMOS and evolving nano-structure elements); (3) their 
implementation cost, switching speed, energy efficiency, and reliability。 
此次會議，我們共有兩篇論文發表。其中”Complexity-effective dynamic range 
compression for digital hearing aids” 為 Oral Presentation Paper; “Improving energy 
efficiency of functional units by exploiting their data-dependent latency”則為 Poster 
Session Paper. 除此之外，本人也擔任會議中 Poster Session 的 Co-Chair。 
本次會議共有三場 Keynote Speech; 分別為(1) Prof. Giovanni De Micheli 主講的
“Nanosystems: Devices, Circuits, Architectures and Applications”。(2) Dr. Alain 
Ripart 主講的“From Smart Pacemaker to Remote Monitoring of Cardiac Function”。
(3) Dr. Wolf-Dietrich Weber 主 講 的 “Energy-Saving Approaches for 
Warehouse-Scale Computing”。
