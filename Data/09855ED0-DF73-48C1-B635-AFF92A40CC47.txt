High-tech companies’ readiness assessment for alternative workplaces 
 
Accepted by African Journal of Business Management (SSCI) in 2010 
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Purpose - The aim of this paper is to provide an understanding of the assessment of the initial 
readiness for AWA to assist the process of decision-making for AWA adoption from an 
organizational perspective. 
 
Design/methodology/approach – A set of readiness level assessment indicators (RLAI) with 
three main categories of relative advantage, compatibility and complexity is developed to help 
decision makers assess the extent of an organization’s readiness for the adoption of an AWA. 
Using the RLAI, a total of 64 real adoption cases are collected from 19 large high-tech 
companies that had already adopted any of the six AWA types: hoteling, group address, shared 
office, home office, and virtual office.  
 
Findings – RLAI proposed by this research has established a comprehensive and systematic 
approach and provides decision makers with helpful guidelines for the AWA readiness 
assessment. 
 
Originality/value of paper – The results documented in this paper provide many other 
organizations facing similar decision problems with insightful strategies and useful implications. 
 
Research limitations/implications– In exploring various types of AWA, this research is limited 
to only primary place for work and full-time AWAs. Other types of AWAs such as mixed type, 
part-time AWAs, supplemental work-at-home and self-employed workers are not examined in 
this research.

fourth factor: supplemental work at home which is the dependent variable in their study. 
Characteristics surrounding AWA are organizational, individual, work, household and 
technology characteristics (Belanger and Collins, 1998) and the AWA environments are 
separated into four components: social environment, technical environment, resource 
environment, and organizational structure environment (Swan et al., 2004). Numerous studies 
of AWA adoption have focused on organizational factors (Ruppel and Harrington, 1995), 
worker and task attributes (Kayworth and Leidner, 2002), and technological supports. Kowalski 
and Swanson (2005) provide a framework of critical success factors including support, 
communication and trust that are instrumental for organizations looking to develop an AWA 
program.  
 
Much research has attempted to find solutions for AWA adoption issues. Fritz et. al., (1994) 
proposed a method for determining the suitability of an AWA implementation framework. (Bui 
et. al., 1996) have described various types of AWAs and discussed the suitability of each AWA 
type from the organizational perspective. Shin et al., (2000) have depicted a conceptual model 
of intra-organizational adoption of telework at four stages: initiation, adoption, implementation 
and institutionalization. Higa and Wijayanayake, (1998) have delineated the adoption patterns 
of different AWA types by different areas and the size of organizations in Japan. Higa and Shin, 
(2003) have examined and compared five successful AWA adoption cases and four not-so-
successful adoption cases in terms of four AWA adoption phases: inception, testing, 
implementation and future planning. However, none of the decision models has shown clear 
evidence regarding its applicability to the AWA adoption decision process (Clark, 1998). A 
literature review reveals that there is little guidance about which organization, work types, 
workers and workspaces are compatible for AWA programs (Belanger and Collins, 1998), and 
no research about how the decision should be made to adopt a particular type of alternative 
workplace arrangement (Fritz et al., 1996). Today’s enterprises need assistance in assessing 
their readiness for AWA and developing a distributed workplace strategy (Harrison 2002). The 
problem is that decision makers have no established tools to assess their readiness for AWA or 
to select among the most appropriate AWA type considering their organizations’ business 
reasons of adoption and the current readiness conditions.  
 
The purpose of this research is to provide an understanding of the assessment of the initial 
readiness for AWA to assist the process of decision-making for AWA adoption from an 
organizational perspective. The specific objective is to develop Readiness Level Assessment 
Indicators (RLAI) for assessing the extent of an organization’s readiness for the adoption of an 
AWA. RLAIs can be used as to predict the potential successfulness of AWA adoption from an 
organizational perspective. To achieve this, at the outset, with particular emphasis on Rogers’s 
innovation attributes (Rogers, 1995) and the Leavitt’s model of organizational subsystems

3. Assessment Metrics for RLAI 
 
Organizational readiness assessment needs to be performed to provide decision makers with a 
reliable, quantifiable assessment of the organization’s potential readiness to successfully 
making the transition to alternative workplaces (Grantham et. al, 2007). Major business reasons, 
surrounding factors and relevant attributes are identified based on Rogers’s innovation 
attributes and Leavitt’s model of organizational subsystems as shown in Fig. 1.  
Assessment indicators are finally determined by two different stages. First, significant factors, 
relevant attributes and assessment indicators are initially selected based on combined insights 
from the literature review and the discussions at the conferences. Next, the validity of the 
selected assessment indicators is additionally evaluated by the panel of experts formed for this 
research in order to build the readiness level assessment indicators (RLAI), which measure the 
initial readiness of high-tech companies for adopting an AWA.  
 
3.1 Innovation Attributes 
Many researchers describe innovation as a new idea, policy, process, product or program. An 
adoption of AWA as an alternative form of workplace arrangement would create some type of 
innovation in the organization. There are five perceived innovation attributes influencing 
adoption intention: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, observability, and trialability 
in innovation diffusion theory (Rogers, 1995). The innovation theory can be served as a 
foundation for decision makers to start considering the adoption of AWA as an organizational 
innovation. Among these attributes speeding the adoption of organizational innovation, which 
is AWA in this study, relative advantage, compatibility and complexity are found more 
important in influencing adoption decision (Karnowski and White, 2002). Therefore, relative 
advantage, compatibility and complexity are used to investigate factors in each of the three 
AWA categories: business reasons, appropriateness and challenges.   
From a readiness assessment standpoint, business reasons are represented as objectives and how 
clearly objectives of AWA adoption are identified and selected are assessed. Next, 
appropriateness is measured as appropriateness level and how appropriate in general the AWA 
adoption is with existing conditions is evaluated. Finally, challenges are measured as 
overcoming level. It measures whether or not managerial control practices exist, and if they do 
exist, evaluates how actively they are practiced. All the factors and attributes are extracted from 
each AWA category and readiness assessment areas to build up readiness level assessment 
indicators (RLAI) as shown in Fig. 1.

3.2.2 Appropriateness 
When the adoption of an AWA is seen as suitable given an organization’s existing conditions, it 
can be concluded that the organization is ready to adopt the AWA. The existing conditions can 
be represented as significant factors surrounding the AWA. Leavitt selected four elements for 
describing an organization: technology, structure, task and people (Leavitt, 1965), and 
management scholars added organizational culture to the four elements selected by Leavitt 
(Gordon and Olson, 1985).  These elements gave an outline at the beginning to identify the 
important factors for AWA adoption when measuring appropriateness for a given organization. 
As work patterns and structures evolve faster than workplaces are able to adapt, business 
patterns are also dramatically changing. AWAs can be attractive to large organizations due to 
their potential benefits, but organizations need to consider whether or not their goals, objectives, 
and surrounding conditions, as well as characteristics of their work, employees, and facilities, 
are appropriately suited for readiness assessment.  
3.2.3 Challenges 
At the organizational level, control, coordination and supervision of distributed workers are 
much harder than they are for workers on-site. Most challenges in adopting AWA are found in 
the area of managerial issues, including performance evaluation and coordination from the 
organizational perspective. It can be assumed that well-prepared managerial actions including a 
wide range of activities dealing with challenges in AWA settings can positively influence the 
success of AWA adoption. Areas in which AWA can lead to difficulties are performance 
evaluation, supervision, coordination, policy and guideline provision and learning opportunities 
for distributed workers (Fritz et. al., 1996; Fritz et. al., 1998; Apgar, 1998; Kurland and Bailey, 
1999; Cascio, 2000; Roitz and Jackson, 2006).

half of all the cases are categorized as “highly satisfied”. About 80% of all the cases are 
marked as “satisfied” or above with their satisfaction level, which means that adoption cases 
collected by RLAI, which is expected to effectively capture the readiness level of the 
organizations, can represent best practices for AWA adoption.

4.4 Case Description on Readiness Level (X1-X18) 
Most of the high-tech companies seem to have rated the readiness levels, named as X1-X15, 
“medium.”  However, a substantial number of companies rated X2, X6, X9, and X13 
“relatively high,” as shown in Table 4. Among managerial issues measuring the establishment 
capacity of managerial practices, results-based performance evaluation methods and virtual 
teamwork in practice within the organization exist in most technology companies, but they 
are not actively in practice. However, most technology companies not only have a clear 
policy/guideline provision for AWA, but actively follow it. Among the 18 variables 
measuring the readiness level of each case, 16 variables are positively correlated with the 
satisfaction level of AWA adoption, and among the 16 readiness variables showing a positive 
rank correlation with Y2, 13 variables are significant at the .01 level (99% level) for a two-
tailed prediction.

4.5 Discussion of Best Practice Cases 
While describing AWA adoption cases collected from high-tech companies, some important 
features of successful AWA adoption cases are revealed. One is the relatively more important 
objectives by different AWA type, and the other feature is that there are different readiness 
levels expressed in appropriateness and overcoming levels as reported for on and off site 
types. First, relatively more successful cases are extracted from the case data. Only 33 cases 
with the satisfaction level “3”, highly satisfied with AWA adoption, are selected for more 
analysis to determine suggested objectives by different AWA types. For each AWA type, the 
main objectives of each case have been identified based on the higher frequency of selection 
from the respondents. According to the frequency of selection, the main objectives for 
adopting each AWA type are the following: 
 
 Hoteling: “reduced office space costs” and “improved productivity” 
 Group address: “improved productivity” and “reduced turnover and 
absenteeism”  
 Shared office: “reduced office space costs” and “employee’s work-life 
balance”  
 Satellite office: “improved productivity” and “improved customer 
satisfaction”  
 Home office: “reduced office space costs” and “improved customer 
satisfaction”  
 Virtual office: “reduced office space costs” and “improved customer 
satisfaction” 
 
Next, the average overcoming levels are calculated from successful cases to compare 
differences in overcoming levels between on-site and off-site types. Among three overcoming 
measurement areas, levels of off-site types are higher than the ones of on-site types in all 
three areas. This confirms the previous research findings (Kurland and Bailey, 1999) that 
managerial challenges become greater as distributed workers are further from the central 
office in terms of physical distance so that higher overcoming levels are needed for 
successful AWA adoption.

Fig. 3. Appropriateness Level Comparison between Different AWA Types 
 
The areas in which obvious distinctions between on-site and off-site types are revealed are 
work types, process and physical presence. These attributes are all under “work” factor. This 
indicates that the level of interaction needed to perform the work and the level of required 
physical presence at the office are found to be lower in off-site types. Surprisingly, sequential 
work processes are found more in on-site types, whereas it is assumed that sequential work 
processes would be found more in off-site types. This indicates that work process is not a 
critical attribute in selecting an appropriate AWA type because work process itself doesn’t 
seem to be a significant issue anymore with the development of sophisticated ICT.  
 
4.6 Rank Correlation Analysis Results 
Rank correlation analysis is conducted to measure the association between two ordinal 
variables:  the readiness level and the satisfaction level. Two rank correlations, Spearman’s 
and Kendall’s, show similar results. Among the 18 variables measuring the readiness level for 
each case, the 16 variables are positively correlated with the organization’s satisfaction level 
with AWA adoption as depicted in Fig. 4.  
 
Among the 16 variables showing a positive correlation with Y2, 13 of them are significant at 
the .01 level (99% level) for a two-tailed prediction. Assuming that X4 and X8 are less 
significant variables measuring the readiness, it is concluded that a positive correlation exists 
between organizational readiness level for AWA adoption and organization’s satisfaction with 
AWA.

organization’s satisfaction with AWA.

6. Future Research 
The scope of this research is limited to only the initiation stage and adoption stage. In the 
future, it will be necessary to extend the scope to the next implementation stage, where a 
detailed feasibility study including cost estimation and risk analysis for the final adoption 
decision is conducted. In future research, based upon a larger sample of AWA adoption cases 
from other industries, more efforts could be researched to develop decision support systems 
which can provide even more accurate and solid predictions regarding AWA adoption 
decision issues as well as measure the performance of distributed workers.
