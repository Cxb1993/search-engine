Abstract 
In general, stock market volatility 
consists of characteristics that are clustering 
and asymmetric with respect to both good 
news and bad news. Therefore, we have 
proposed a two-stage method to address this 
issue. The procedure that we used is as 
follows: first, we use Fuzzy-Switch to analyze 
asymmetric of stock market volatility and 
adopt the threshold values to discriminate 
between two regimes of positive and negative 
fluctuation. Second, use the two regimes of 
first stage I to set up adaptive neuron-fuzzy 
inference systems (ANFIS) Generalized 
autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity 
3 
volatility (assuming persistence). Some of 
these effects can be captured by modifications 
of linear models, while others demand 
nonlinear approaches. Unfortunately, due to 
their complexity, nonlinear models are in very 
limited use today [1,25,28,30]. 
Considering these difficulties, there is 
demand for more flexible model. In this study, 
we develop a new tool of Fuzzy-Switch 
ANFIS GARCH model based on T-S fuzzy 
systems by Takagi and Sugeno [27].  The 
fuzzy modeling is promising techniques for 
describing complex dynamics and 
asymmetries in systems. Combining the ease 
of implementation and convenience of linear 
models with an ability to capture complex 
system correlations, we propose that fuzzy 
models could also be a sensible choice for 
analyzing both temporal asymmetries and 
persistence. 
In this study, we propose tool combine 
Fuzzy systems and GARCH models. The 
process of optimizing fuzzy systems and 
GARCH model parameters is highly complex 
and nonlinear. A PSO-based parameter 
estimation algorithm was proposed to derive 
the optimal solution for the Fuzzy-GARCH 
model in this paper. The PSO is an 
evolutionary computation technique presented 
in 1995 by Kennedy and Eberhart [18]; it is 
inspired by the social behavior of animals, 
such as flocks of birds, swarms of insects, and 
schools of fish. Recently, PSO has been 
successfully used to address complex 
optimization problems [4,10,16,19-20]. The 
PSO is a population-based optimization 
approach, in which the population is called as 
a swarm and each swarm consists of many 
particles. In PSO, the trajectory of each 
particle in the search space is adjusted by 
dynamically altering the velocity of each 
particle. More specifically, the trajectory of 
each particle in the search space is adjusted 
according to both the best local position of the 
particle and the best global position in the 
same search space. Because the PSO 
simultaneously evaluates many points in a 
parameter space, it is more likely to converge 
on the optimal solution [16]. In particular, 
there is no requirement that the search space is 
differentiable or continuous, and the algorithm 
can iterate several times for each data point. 
In practice, in-sample parameter 
estimation schemes commonly assume a 
certain volatility model structure to handle 
financial stocks [15,31]. Thus, it is necessary 
to use the adaptive parameter estimation 
scheme for out-of-sample volatility models. In 
this study we determined the out-of-sample 
forecast volatility of financial stocks using the 
adaptive algorithm [21,23] to track changes in 
volatility. Our simulations use stock market 
data from the Taiwan Stock Exchange 
weighted stock index (Taiwan), DAX 30 
(Germany), and Nikkei 225 index (Japan) 
January 1, 2004 through September 31, 2009. 
The data set was divided two parts: the first 
part of the data (January 1, 2004, through 
December 31, 2007) consists of the in-sample 
period, while the second part of the data 
(January 1, 2008, through September 31, 2009) 
is the forecast, out-of-sample period [14-15].

fuzzy control mechanism to select suitable 
threshold values to differentiate positive from 
negative information in order to build the 
Fuzzy-Switch ANFIS-GRACH model shown 
in Fig. 1.  
Fuzzy logic systems are universal 
approximations that can uniformly estimate 
nonlinear continuous functions with arbitrary 
accuracy. The T-S fuzzy model is a piecewise 
interpolation of several models, which 
operates using membership functions. The 
fuzzy model is described by IF-THEN rules 
and will be employed here to ensure that the 
GARCH(1,1) model can appropriately deal 
with the cluster problem. The lth rule of the 
T-S fuzzy system for GARCH(1,1) is 
described by  
( )lRule :

The premise of a fuzzy implication indicates a

where nlc  and nl  are the center and the 
spread of the lth rule membership function 
corresponding to the nth premise variable, 
respectively. The Eq. (5) and Eq. (8) are a 
very highly nonlinear function. It is very 
difficult to find the global solution. PSO 
methods use optimization and evolutionary 
computation learning algorithms. Therefore, 
in this study, we use of PSO methods to search 
the parameters of the fuzzy systems and 
GARCH models.   
In this study, a PSO-based method is adopted 
to solve the global minimize problem of 
2ˆ( )E h h   . In our design problem, finding 
the minimum mean square error is equivalent 
to obtaining a maximum fitness value in the 
PSO search process. Intuitively, we have a 
7 
financial market very well when the market 
undergoes large fluctuation. The purposed 
model, which uses fuzzy rules to generate the 
asymmetric GARCH model, can capture the 
asymmetry and nonlinearity of the markets, 
and it exhibits better forecasting skill than the 
other models. 
The logarithmic difference data are given 
in Fig. 3, and the final membership functions 
of threshold value ( )r t  are shown in Fig. 4. 
Upon inspection of Figs. 3–4, it is clear that 
the financial markets are asymmetric and that 
the influence of negative information is 
greater than that of positive information. This 
figures shows that the daily return for the 
Germany index is smaller than those of the 
other two financial markets, indicating that 
these indexes exhibit volatility clustering and 
asymmetric. 
Fig. 5 is shows the forecasting volatility 
of the Taiwan, Japan, and Germany by 
proposed method. The purposed model, which 
uses fuzzy rules to generate the asymmetric 
GARCH model and adaptive method to 
forecasting volatility, can capture the 
asymmetry of the markets, and it exhibits 
better forecasting skill than the other models. 
 
4. Conclusions  
The empirical results suggest that the 
adaptive model is advantageous for modeling 
the dynamics of high-frequency, time-varying 
volatility. Simulation evidence demonstrates 
that the financial market data used in this 
study are nonlinear and time-dependent. Thus, 
this paper proposes a new, non-linear, and 
highly complex method that we call the 
“Fuzzy-switch ANFIS-GARCH.” We used a 
PSO-based design method to estimate the 
parameters of the proposed model and an 
adaptive algorithm to forecast the volatility of 
various financial markets. Our simulation 
results indicate that the proposed method 
offers significant improvements in forecasting 
ability. Furthermore, the PSO algorithm was 
able to search for peaks parallel to the 
parameter space. Therefore, it was not 
necessary to specify any initial conditions to 
improve the results.

1.Flexibility of Asymmetric GARCH Model:  
在財務金融實證研究上，資料的條件變異數常會受到過去價格波動的影響而隨著時間變
動，常會有波動群聚(volatility clustering)的現象，在這情形下 GARCH 對於波動群聚
有不錯解釋，但無法處理市場存在著資訊不對稱(股市跌和漲幅不對稱)與槓桿效應
(leverage effect)的現象。在金融市場中，價格易受到正向、負向或其他資訊衝擊影響，
而對於正向、負向或其他資訊衝擊，市場會有不同程度的反應，本成果是以 Fuzzy 建構切
換對正向、負向或其他資訊衝擊的非對稱 GARCH 型來描述股市波動。但研究成果也發現在
不同期間結果變化相當大，原本適合的門檻，也可能在其他期間有相反結果，此現象未來
可能使用決策方式處理。 
 
2.Forecasting volatility using ANFIS-GARCH model： 
一般股市的預測很少使用適應性遞迴方式，本研究是將之前研究利用 ANFIS 適應性調整參
數應用於預測股市波動，結果大部有不錯效果。
