Abstract 
 
In this study, an optical scheme based 
on Stokes-Mueller Formalism and rotating 
wave-plate Stokes polarimeter is successfully 
developed to simultaneously measure optical 
rotation angle and retardance. The average 
relative errors in the measured rotation angle 
and retardance of a half-wave plate which are 
solved by nonlinear equations of detected 
Stokes parameters are determined to be just 
 % (1.16 % for a perfect half-wave 
plate with retardance of 180 ) and 0.40 % 
respectively. The average relative error in the 
measured rotation angles of glucose solutions 
with concentrations ranging from 0-1.2 g/dl 
is determined to be  % (  % under 
calibration with sample cell). From the 
inspection of simultaneous measurement of 
rotation angle and retardance in a glucose 
solution followed by a half-wave plate, the 
average relative error in the measured 
rotation angles of glucose solutions is 
determined to be 4.23 % ( 1.81  % under 
calibration with sample cell). The correlation 
coefficient between the measured rotation 
angle and the glucose concentration is found 
to be 0.99966, while the standard deviation is 
just , and the average relative error 
in the measured retardance of a half-wave 
plate is determined to be just 0.47 %. 
Consequently, the derived algorithm for 
simultaneously measuring rotation angle and 
retardance is feasible, and the developed 
system is evaluated with a precision of 10 % 
approximately in rotation angle and a high 
precision of 0.0032 % in retardance 
measurement.

三、方法論 
   
3.1 Optical configuration 
The optical configuration for the 
simultaneous measurement of optical rotation 
angle and retardance is shown in Fig. 1. The 
measurement system consists of a light 
source, polarizer, sample, and a Stokes 
polarimeter. A He-Ne laser with wavelength 
632.8 nm is employed as the light source. 
The polarization condition of incident beam 
is controlled to be linear by a polarizer. After 
this initial beam passes through polarizer 
with  to the horizontal plane and sample, 
it is given the change of polarization state. 
The change in the polarization condition of 
the transmitted beam from the sample is 
monitored by measuring the Stokes 
parameters with a rotating wave-plate Stokes 
polarimeter (Thorlabs, PA510). Subsequently, 
the optical rotation angle and retardance are 
estimated by substituting the observed Stokes 
parameters of output light into derived 
algorithm.

3.2 Principle 
The polarization state of light can be 
completely described by a Stokes 
vector (where  
denotes transposition). We can write the four 
Stokes Components as

where  is the total light intensity,  
represents the intensity difference between 
horizontal and vertical linearly polarized 
components,  represents the intensity 
difference between linearly polarized 
components oriented at  angle, and  
represents the intensity difference between 
right and left circular components. A

the slow axis of the wave plate would 
transmit /L RI  as the intensity of left and

An optic that changes the polarization 
state of light is modeled by a Mueller matrix 
(4x4) such that the inner product of the 
Stokes vector that models the polarization 
state of incident light  with the Muller 
matrix that models that optics

The Mueller matrix for a sample with 
the optical rotation angle, γ , and the 
retardance, β , such as a half-wave plate, is 
expressed as Eq. (3). When the retardance, 
β , in a perfect half-wave plate is , the 
half-wave plate can be considered as a chiral 
medium, and hence the Mueller matrix for a 
chiral medium with undermined rotation 
angle [18] is given as Eq. (4).

obtaining optical rotation angle of a chiral 
medium. Furthermore, the retardance of a 
half-wave plate can be obtained from an 
arctangent function of the ratio of the Stokes 
parameter, , to the Stokes parameter, , 
for which the dependence with rotation angle 
vanishes, and is independent of  in input

Noted that we use simple a linear 
regression of rotation angles corresponding 
with glucose concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, and

from the zero value, calculated by algorithm

residual effect of rotation angle within empty

To verify the repeatability of the 
measurement system for measuring rotation 
angle, the rotation angle of a glucose sample 
with a concentration of 0.1 g/dl was 
measured 10 times. From the results of Fig. 5, 
a standard deviation of 1.48 x 10-5 degrees 
and the average value of 0.0  are 
observed in 
28694o
γ , which leads to a 1σ value of 
0.052 % of the average. The corresponding 
results presented in Fig. 5 confirm that the 
proposed system has high repeatability 
characteristics. The average value in 
measured rotation angle, after subtracting the 
rotation angle within empty cell, is 
determined to be . According to 
ref. [22], a 0.1 g/dl glucose solution has a 
rotation angle of  when measured at 
a temperature of  using a laser beam 
with a wavelength of 633 nm, therefore, the 
average relative errors in measured rotation 
angle of glucose sample with a concentration 
of 0.1 g/dl are 9.10 % (without calibration of 
empty cell) and 0.94 % (with calibration of 
empty cell) respectively.

Note that before calibrating the residual

being minimum value of 0.001 and Stokes

regarding to the glucose with a concentration 
of 0.1 g/dl, into Eq. (17), the measurement 
error of rotation angle is determined to be 
.  Therefore, the system has an 
estimated precision of 9.97 % in rotation 
angle measurement.

Thirdly, the measurement system was 
employed to measure glucose solution 
followed by a half-wave plate with its 
principal axis angle set at  for the 
simultaneous measurement of rotation angle 
corresponding glucose concentration range 
from 0~1.2 g/dl and retardance of a 
half-wave plate. The experimental results are 
presented in Fig. 6. From inspection, the 
correlation coefficient is found to be 0.99966 
between the measured rotation angle and the 
glucose concentration, while the standard 
deviation is just . Moreover, the 
average relative error in the measured 
rotation angle is determined to be  %.

According, we use simple a linear 
regression of rotation angles corresponding 
with glucose concentration of 0.1, 0.2, and 
0.4 g/dl to estimate the rotation angle of 
empty cell to be , which is different 
from the value of zero, calculated by 
algorithm of arcsine function of , Stokes

in the measured retardance of a half-wave 
plate is determined to be just 0.47 %. 
In conclusions, the derived algorithm 
for simultaneously measuring the rotation 
angle corresponding concentration of glucose 
and retardance of a half-wave plate is 
feasible. The residual rotation angle within 
empty sample cell needs to be carefully 
calibrated during the experiment, and a 
half-wave plate inserted after glucose 
solution has a polarization-retained effect 
and is beneficial in the measured rotation 
angle corresponding with glucose 
concentration. The developed system is 
evaluated with a precision of 10 % in rotation 
angle measurement and a high precision of 
0.0032 % in retardance measurement. Most 
of all, the precision and accuracy of Stokes 
parameters measured by a Stokes polarimeter 
play a key role for the overall precision of 
retardance and rotation angle measurements.
