can be used to recover the transmitted data symbols, ( )s n , 
where ( ) ( ) ( )h n c n f n= ∗  denotes the impulse response of 
the combined channel-equalizer system. 
The constant modulus algorithm (CMA) is one of the most 
widely used blind equalization algorithms [1]–[4]. However, 
since the CMA cost function is invariant to a phase rotation in 
the constellation, the equalizer output signal constellation 
suffers from an arbitrary phase rotation. To solve this inherent 
problem, Oh and Chin [5], and Yang, Werner and Dumont [7], 
proposed the multimodulus algorithm (MMA), whose cost 
function is given by 
2 2 2 2

where ( )Ry n  and ( )Iy n  are the real and imaginary parts 
of the equalizer output, respectively, while RR ,2  and IR ,2

which ( )Rs n  and ( )Is n  denote the real and imaginary parts 
of ( )s n , respectively. Decomposing the cost function of 
MMA into real and imaginary parts thus allows both the 
modulus and the phase of the equalizer output to be 
considered; therefore joint blind equalization and carrier 
phase recovery may be simultaneously accomplished, 
eliminating the need for an adaptive phase rotator to perform 
separate constellation phase recovery in steady-state 
operation. 
The analysis in [8], which concerns only the square 
constellations, indicates that the MMA can remove 
inter-symbol interference (ISI) and simultaneously correct the 
phase error, because it implicitly incorporates a 
phase-tracking loop, which automatically recovers the carrier 
phase. However, when the transmitted symbol statistics are of 
quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) non-square 
constellations for which the number of bits per symbol is odd, 
the N-points constellations ( 0,2 12 ≥∈= + iandIntergeriN i ) 
can be arranged into oblong (or non-square rectangular) 
constellations so long as 2 2[ ( )] [ ( )]R IE s n E s n≠  is satisfied. 
For example, Fig. 1(a) illustrates a 128-QAM arranged by 
rectangular (8 16) QAM× −  with the required averaged 
transmitted power of 81.156. The 128-QAM constellations 
can also be arranged into cross constellations obtained from a 
square constellation of 12 12 144× =  points, by removing 
outer points in each corner as illustrated in Fig. 1(b) with the 
required averaged transmitted power of 82. Notably, the 
distance between two adjacent message points in the 
rectangular constellations illustrated in Fig. 1(a) has been 
modified to be 1.75 instead of 2, so that the average 
transmitted powers required by both cross and rectangular 
constellations are almost identical. In this work, the 
rectangular constellation illustrated in Fig. 1(a) is used as an 
example to demonstrate that the MMA using rectangular 
QAM constellations significantly outperforms its cross 
counterpart in the recovery of the carrier phase introduced by 
channels, without requiring additional average transmitted 
power. Although reducing the distance of adjacent message 
points in the proposed rectangular constellation in Fig. 1(a) 
may increase the adaptive equalizer’s symbol-error rate (SER) 
when it switches to the decision-directed mode, this work is 
concerned with the unique feature of fast carrier phase 
recovery associated with the MMA using rectangular 
constellations during blind equalization process owing to its 
asymmetric nature of the real and imaginary parts of the 
source statistics. Other rectangular-like constellations may be 
designed to achieve the best compromise among a fast carrier 
phase recovery, low steady-state SER and low average 
transmitted power, as long as 2 2[ ( )] [ ( )]R IE s n E s n≠  is 
satisfied.

QAM source (for square, cross, and rectangular 
constellations) with each member of the symbol alphabet

independent of n, we denote expectations of this form by 
[ ]iE s  and [ ]iE s , respectively, in (2) for 2, 4i = . Terms 
( )Rs n  and ( )Is n , which will be denoted by Rs  and Is , 
respectively, are assumed to be independent of each other, 
 4
( )4 2 2[ ] 3 [ ] 0R RE s E s− < ), then all the pre-specified Mh  (with 
the associated MI ) with the stationary points shown in (7), 
for 2M ≥ , can be shown to be unstable equilibria (saddle 
points) by applying the concept proposed by Foschini [6]. 
Consequently, all the vectors Mh , 2,3,...,M =  are saddle 
points. Clearly, it can be easily computed from (8) and (9) 
that the four saddle points are located nearer the origin as the 
number of non-zero components of Mh  rises. As M 
decreases during the blind equalization process, the locations 
of the four saddle points for Mh  move dynamically away 
from the origin in four mutually perpendicular directions. The 
four saddle points eventually converge as 1M →  to [ 1,0]±  
and [0, (1)]r−± , where the former two stationary points 
become the only two global minima, and the latter two are 
still two saddle points. 
When compared with (11), the result in (7) is significant, 
since it implies that, for 2≥M  (during the transient (or 
startup) mode operation), the number of saddle points is only 
half those of the square and cross constellations when the 
rectangular constellations are adopted (i.e., the four saddle 
points existing in square and cross constellations along 
3 5 7( ) , , ,
4 4 4 4
k π π π πθ =  disappear). Consequently, the 
frequency of attraction toward the vicinity of the saddle 
points, around which it exhibits slow convergence, before 
converging to the desired minimum, is significantly 
diminished when using rectangular constellations. Therefore, 
using rectangular constellations may accelerate the magnitude 
equalization (or ISI removing) process during the transient 
mode operation.

substituting M = 1 into (8) and (9)], which correspond to a 
local maximum, local (hence, global) minima and two saddle 
points, respectively, by examining the second derivative of 
the cost function [9]. Notably, the finding that [1,0]  and 
[ 1,0]−  are the only two global minima reveals that phase 
errors that are multiples of 0180  are undetectable for 
0180 symmetric−  rectangular constellations. This finding 
contrasts with equalizer output with a 090  phase ambiguity 
when using the quadrantally symmetric QAM square and 
cross constellations because phase errors that are multiples of 
090  are undetectable. Therefore, the use of rectangular 
constellations could still automatically yield correct equalizer 
output as long as the phase rotation introduced by channels is 
smaller than 0180 . Figure 2(b) depicts the MMA cost 
surface for rectangular (8 16) QAM× −  input by substituting 
1=M  into (2). 
 
III. CARRIER PHASE TRACKING CAPABILITY 
 
This section presents one superior phase tracking 
capability of the rectangular constellation. When using the 
MMA with the rectangular QAM based on the stochastic 
gradient descent (SGD) algorithm, ( )Mh k  with maximum 
modulus automatically moves toward the stationary points at 
[ ( ),0]r M+  and [ ( ),0]r M+− , respectively, when 
( )90 90o okθ− < <  and ( )90 270o okθ< < , once the 
magnitude of ( )Mh k  with maximum modulus is large 
enough during the transient mode operation. Meanwhile, the 
remaining 1M −  nonzero components of Mh  tend to 
diminish, and the two stationary points at [ ( ),0] [1,0]r M+ →  
and [ ( ),0] [ 1,0]r M+− → −  automatically become the only two 
global minima when 1M → .

also simulated, and achieved magnitude equalization 
( 20ISI dB≤ − ) before iteration 5000 as depicted in Fig. 4. 
However, its equalizer output suffered from an arbitrary 
phase rotation. 
Figure 6 depicts the ensemble-averaged convergence 
trajectories of ( )Mh k  with maximum modulus associated 
with CMA (cross 128-QAM), MMA (cross 128-QAM) and 
MMA (rectangular (8 16) QAM× − ), which dynamically 
evolved under the same , ,[ ( ), ( )]M R M Ih k h k  coordinate from 
iteration 100 to iteration 50000 over 200 independent runs. In 
this figure, * denotes the starting point of each trajectory at 
iteration 100; D  denotes the end point of the corresponding 
trajectory at iteration 50000, and •  denotes the location of 
the corresponding trajectory that was dynamically evolving 
for every 5000 iterations. The two MMAs using cross 
128-QAM and rectangular (8 16) QAM× −  converged to 
(0.9812, -0.00469) and (0.9973, -0.001538), respectively, at 
iteration 50000. And the convergence speed using the 
rectangular constellation was much faster than that using the 
cross constellation. The rectangular constellation almost 
achieved phase recovery around iteration 10000 (around the 
second • ) whereas cross constellation required at least 
30000n =  iterations (around the sixth • ). The CMA, 
which is blind to the carrier phase, focused only on removing 
the ISI and appeared to take the shortest cut, converging to 
(0.7566, -0.6507) merely to satisfy the condition of 
max( ( ) ) 1Mh k ≅  around iteration 5000. 
 
V. CONCLUSION 
 
The CMA is able to achieve fast magnitude equalization. 
However, a rotator that can rotate the constellation back in 
the right position at the output of the equalizer is needed in 
steady-state operation. The MMA using both cross and 
rectangular constellations can achieve magnitude equalization 
and carrier phase recovery simultaneously. The rectangular 
constellations significantly outperform the cross 
constellations for the following reasons all of which are 
consequences of 2 2] ][ [R IE s E s≠ . First, the four saddle points 
existing in the square and cross constellations along 
3 5 7
( ) , , ,
4 4 4 4
k
π π π πθ =  are absent when using rectangular 
constellations. Consequently, the frequency of being attracted 
toward the vicinity of the saddle points, around which it 
exhibits slow convergence, before converging to the desired 
minimum, is significantly diminished when using rectangular 
constellations. Therefore, the use of rectangular constellations 
may accelerate the magnitude equalization process during the 
transient operation. Second, when using the MMA with 
rectangular QAM based on the SGD method, the non-zero 
component ( )Mh k  with maximum modulus in Mh  
automatically moves toward the stationary points at 
[ ( ),0]r M+±  to recover the carrier phase once the magnitude 
of ( )Mh k  is sufficiently large during the transient mode 
operation. More importantly, rectangular constellations 
exhibit much faster phase tracking than cross constellations, 
because they have much sharper gradient of the cost surface 
to global minima. Consequently, ( )Mh k  using a rectangular 
constellation moves down toward the two global minima at 
[ 1,0]±  much faster than that of using cross constellation. 
Third, MMA with a rectangular constellation is better able to 
recover the phase rotation introduced by channels than MMA 
with a cross or square constellation, because the rectangular 
constellation has only two global minima at ]0,1[± , rather 
than the four global minima in the latter two cases. Therefore, 
any phase error within D180  can be correctly detected when 
using a rectangular constellation.
