Abstract 
In the paper, we propose a mathematical model that deals 
with signal interference, hidden nodes and STDMA time slots 
among nodes of a path for a WMN to calculate maximum 
throughput of the path. An algorithm, named Path_C algorithm 
is also developed, to determine whether a node in such a 
topology can transmit data with its maximum data rate or not 
or should be prohibited to send data to the next node. The idea 
of an urgent path that transmits urgent data, e.g., real-time 
data, is also proposed. An urgent notification packet, e.g., for a 
traffic jam, can be delivered through this path. Simulation 
results show that error rates between simulated throughput by 
using ns2 and calculated by deploying the mathematical model 
are all less than 5%.  
 
1. Introduction 
Recently, wireless mesh networks (WMNs) have emerged 
as a key technology and started an upsurge in the wireless 
research. The primary advantage of these networks is their 
rapid deployment and easy installation. Unlike traditional WiFi 
networks where each access point (AP) is connected to a wired 
network, WMNs use multi-hop communication.  
However, what is the maximum throughput of a multi-hop 
wireless network. This subject has been one of hot research 
topics in recent years. Aoun and Boutaba [1] pointed out that 
throughput degrades as offered load exceeds network capacity, 
because bounding the maximum offered load at a source node 
helps reducing packet losses (i.e. dropping) and prevents 
wasting bandwidth. For example, a node at the beginning of a 
chain could actually inject more packets than the subsequent 
nodes can forward. These packets are eventually dropped at 
later nodes. The time this node spends for sending those 
packets decreases the delivered throughput since it prevents 
transmissions at subsequent nodes. Therefore, if we desire each 
node of a multi-hop wireless network achieving its maximum 
throughput, we have to effectively adjust relevant measure (e.g., 
inhibit other paths to transmit data) to avoid packet loss. 
Several papers have discussed this issue. Jain, et al. [2] 
modeled interference using a conflict graph, and presented 
methods for computing upper and lower bounds on optimal 
throughput for a given network and workload. Jun and Sichitiu 
[3] considered network interference and calculated collision 
domain. But they did not deal with hidden node and spatial 
reuse in collision domains.   
On the other hand, when several nodes in a chain topology 
transmit data to common destination node, what will happen? 
In the paper, we propose an algorithm, named Path_C 
algorithm, to determine whether a node in such a topology can 
transmit data with its maximum data rate or not. We also 
propose a mathematical model that calculates the maximum 
throughput of a chain topology WMN. The idea of an urgent 
path that transmits urgent data, e.g., real-time data, is also 
proposed. An urgent notification packet, e.g., for a traffic jam, 
can be also delivered through this path.  
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
introduces the background and related work. In Section 3, we 
derive equations to compute maximum throughputs for 
different numbers of nodes in a chain WMN, and develop an 
algorithm to determine whether traffic of a segment can be 
delivered right now or not. Experimental results are shown in 
section 4. Section 5 concludes this paper and addresses our 
future research. 
 
2. Background and Related Work 
2.1. Wireless Mesh Network 
A WMN as shown in Figure 1 is composed of a set of mesh 
routers, namely Transient Access Points (TAPs), and one or 
many wired Hot Spots (WHSs) [4]. TAPs relay user data to 
WHSs. Through WHSs, TAPs can connect to Internet. 
Increasingly, WMNs are widely used to connect devices in the 
environments where wired network infrastructures do not exist 
or are expensive to deploy.  
 
2.2. Hidden Node Problem and STDMA 
The hidden node problem shown in Figure 2 truly exists in 
multi-hop networks. Nodes A and D can not send data to B and 
E, respectively, at the same time because B (or D) is within the 
interference range of D (B).

(4). Hidden nodes [12]: which as described above is due to 
interference. In a chain path, when path length is longer 
than 3 (excluding the destination node), hidden node 
problem may occur.   
 
Figure 4. The relationship of Q (distance between two adjacent 
nodes), R (communication range (radius) of a node) and IR 
(interference range) of the node 
(5). Total bandwidth of the path: the wider the bandwidth, the 
higher communication data rate, of course, the higher 
transmission efficiency.   
(6). Packet size transmitted on the path: the larger the size of 
a packet, the more data transmitted and then the higher the 
throughput of the path when error rate is low. 
(7). Data rate of a source node on the path: when the data rate 
does not saturate bandwidth of the path, the higher the 
data rate, the higher its throughput.

In the following, we will introduce how to deploy this 
model to determine whether a segment of a path can transmit 
data with its maximum data rate or not. 
 
3.2. What Data Rate a Node can Transmit its Data 
In this study, when a source S attempts to send data, it uses 
AODV routing protocol to discover a path [14], under the 
situation that no routing information is available.  
Type J R G D U Reserved HopCount 
RREQ ID 
Destination IP Address 
Destination Sequence Number 
Originator IP Address 
Originator Sequence Number 
Figure 10. Format of a RREQ packet 
In a chain topology, nodes are linearly connected one by 
one. Each node intending to send data to the destination node 
only issues (rather than broadcasts) a RREQ packet see Figure 
10 which will flow through the subsequent nodes to the 
destination node. We create a table, named C_table, for a 
destination node in route discovery phase. The table has four 
fields, hop_count, source_ip, destination_ip and start_sequence. 
The first records number of nodes that a RREQ packet has 
traveled through, which is also path length of the 
corresponding routing path. The second and the third 
respectively copy originator and destination IP addresses 
conveyed on the RREQ packet. The fourth records the order 
that nodes start transmitting data packets to the destination 
node. The initial value of start_sequence is null. A variable 
sequence_count is also created to keep track the order, and its 
 
  
 
10 
node-disjoint paths [17] with minimal path costs. Node-disjoint 
(Link-disjoint) multipath is defined as paths that do not share 
common nodes (links). Paths established by these approaches 
may relatively close to each other, causing severe inter-path 
interference when data are simultaneously transmitted. Hu and 
Lee [18] brought up a method that can find out two decoupled 
paths to transmit data without any mutual interference. 
However, when the primary path occupies most nodes of a 
network, it may be very difficult to find out the secondary path. 
SCTP uses a backup path to transmit data when the primary 
path cannot work properly, or to retransmit data when an error 
in the primary path occurs [19]. The backup path of a SCTP 
can be viewed as an urgent path. 
In this study, we can choose a path from backup paths 
connecting underlying source and destination nodes as an 
urgent path to transmit urgent data. An urgent path should 
decouple from its primary path, i.e., a path that does not 
interfere with the primary path. If no such path exists, the one 
with the least interference with the primary path will be 
chosen.   
 
4. Validation and Simulation Results 
In this study, we used ns-2 [20] as our simulation tool. Each 
simulation was performed fifteen times all on a wireless 
network deployed in an area of 500 * 500 m
2
. Each time lasted 
200 seconds. CBR (Constant Bit Rate) data was transmitted to 
the same destination. Channel bandwidth is 11 Mbps. 
Attributes used are listed in Table 1. Communication range and 
interference range of a node is 40 m and 90 m, respectively. 
We employed progressive filling [1] to adjust data rates for 
nodes to achieve  their maximum throughput. 
According to Eq. (2), throughput of 1pathN  is as follows.

time =100 sec, traffic of path3 = 300Kbps and source node=A), 
and their total throughput. 93 pathN  is allowed to transmit

 according to 
Eqs. (5), (9) and (8), respectively, and we give 9.0thresholdp . 
Figure 14 shows that when data rate of 93 pathN  is larger 
than 300Kbps (e.g., 310Kbps), and 
91.031.031.029.0 remp  is now larger than  thresholdp , 
severe interference occurs. That is, throughput of 93 pathN  
should not be larger than 300Kbps, otherwise, node r has to 
reduce its data rate to )(rThrrem  (=300Kbps).

maximum data rate or not without being interfered by data 
transmission on other segments. We inhibit a node to start 
transmitting its data when accumulated thresholdrem pp  .  
Such can avoid signal interference among nodes and help to 
dramatically increase throughput of a WMN. Theoretically, 
thresholdp  in the Path_C algorithm is 1. 
Simulation results reveal that error rates between simulated 
by using ns2 and calculated by deploying Eqs. (5), (8) or (9) 
are all less than 5%. Also, an urgent path is absolutely 
necessary. 
In the future, we would like to develop the Path_C 
algorithm for a general topology WMN, and derive the 
mathematical models for behaviors and reliability of such a 
system so that users can predict and realize its behaviors and it 
reliability, respectively, with the models.

本研究計畫提出一個數學模型，以計算在一個無線網狀網路(Wireless Mesh 
Networks)中，一條線性路徑 (liner path)(或稱鏈狀拓撲 (chain 
topology))上的最大容量，我們考慮了訊號干擾、隱藏節點(hidden nodes)
及 STDMA(Spatial Time Division Multiple Access)槽等影響其效能之主
要原因。透過此模型，我們可以預測無線網狀網路(wireless mesh network)
之鏈狀拓撲的最大網路容量，並發展了一個演算法，來決定在此拓撲下的
一個節點，是否可以其最大資料傳輸率來傳送資料、亦或該限制其實際資
料傳輸速度或甚至禁止其傳送資料。在實際運用上，該模型已能獨立運作，
且正確性在 95%以上，已達實用價值。例如，一條需長距離傳輸之 WAN無線
網路線，每隔一段距離便須架設一基地台，而倆倆基地台之間的信號傳輸
如論文實驗所得到之結論，會受隱藏節點之干擾，其結果便是幾個相連之
基地台之間無法平行地傳輸資料給自己之下一站，因而降低基地台平行傳
輸能力，其結果便是大幅降低整體網路傳輸之頻寬與傳輸容量。在該論文
中亦建議每個基地台之傳輸與接收皆使用不同通道，連續四個基地台共使
用八個通道，每一基地台雙向傳輸則採用不同接收與傳地通道，而每四個
連續基地台則重複使用該八個通道，如此，網路頻寬方得以維持。只是基
地台維護不易。 
 
目前之研究僅限於鏈狀拓樸，若擬將之運用在網狀網路，則仍有多項考量，
例如，兩條或多條鏈狀拓樸平行架設或接成星狀拓璞時，前相互間之干擾
仍待進一步釐清，因此下一步將朝此方向繼續研究之，亦將發展初期數學
模型，俾便能實際用在現實環境中。

 其後和大會主席也是此次 NBIS 2010 main conference 之主席日本福岡工業大學教授 Leonard 
Barolli 與另一 main conference NeoFUSION 2010 之主席韓國籍之 Ilsun You，打過招呼之後便移往論
文報告地點，是在另一棟大樓。報告撰寫者有一感想，keynote 之會議場窗外風光明媚，是採自然採
光方式，我告知臨座幾位教授，本建築之設計者有其獨到眼光，如此設計一年不知省下多少採光之
電力，臨座者亦同意個人觀點。其後和下午皆參加自己喜歡之 session，說真的，該 center 在荒郊野
外，不參加 session 還真不知道去哪裡。晚上是 reception，仍在該中心舉行，卻在吃飯時認識了幾位
日本教授，韓國教授與來自上海交通大學與北京清華大學之教授，大家相談甚歡，尤其是 Ilsun You
和上海交通大學之唐飛龍教授，我們三人卻也因此成了好朋友，且一起在今年(2011 年)中擔任 SCI 期
刊 Mobile Information Systems 之 Guest editor，共同編輯了一期之 special issue，真是一個意外之收穫。 
 由於個人參與報告之 sessions 都在第二天，主持人也都是 Ilsun You，而他卻必須在當天早上先行
返回韓國，因此替他接下兩個 session 擔任主持人，在主持的 session 中和幾位來自法國，韓國，大
陸與日本的報告者討論到一些論文之細節，大家都覺得收穫良多。由於班機之故，晚上回到名古屋，
夜宿名古屋市區，九月十六日一早搭機返台，結束前後五天之行程。 
二、與會心得 
 這幾天在會場只遇見兩三位來自台灣來的教授，真不可思議，日本和台灣之距離如此近，卻只
有三四位台灣的教授參加這一個已經歷時十多年之研討會，和今年(2011 年)六月在首爾舉行之
CISIS 2011 共有四十多位來自台灣之學者專家與學生與會相比，實在是有相當大之落差。 
 不過藉著參加國際研討會之機會，和其他國家與會之學者專家共聚一堂，十足可以促進國際交
流，國科會補助學者專家出國發表論文，除了宣揚我國研究實力與成果之外，其最重要之邊際效應
便是國際交流，對國家社會在國際之曝光情形值得肯定。只是係補助性質，金額少了一些，對歐洲
美國等行程較遠之會議，有許多人裹足不前，否則荷包嚴重失血，其實不赴遠地參與會議，對國家
亦是一大損失。 
三、考察參觀活動(無是項活動者略) 
 無 
四、建議 
此番國科會補助七萬元整，然因正值航空公司票價漲價之故，連機票、註冊（兩篇）及住宿已經
遠遠超過此數字，不足者皆自行吸收，不知未來補助款項可以增加否。 
五、攜回資料名稱及內容 
論文集之光碟片，一疊國際友人之名片，美麗的回憶，與與會時聆聽各文章發表所作之筆記。
