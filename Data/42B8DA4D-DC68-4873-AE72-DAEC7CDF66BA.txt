may offer a variety of valuable insights into themolecular mechanisms
of R8-induced immune responses in macrophages.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Peptide synthesis
The octaarginine (RRRRRRRR; R8) and ﬂuorescein-labeled octaargi-
nine used in this study were purchased from Genemed Synthesis, Inc.
(San Antonio, TX, USA). They were prepared using solid phase peptide
synthesis. Fluorescein-5-isothiocynate (FITC) (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St
Louis, MO, USA) was coupled to the N-terminus of R8 (FITC-R8) for
ﬂuorescent labeling. The quality of the peptides was ascertained using
reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and
time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry. The purity of all peptides used was
N95%. The ﬁdelity of the synthesized peptides was ascertained using
electrospray ionizationmass spectrometry (ESI-MS) as follows: 1267.25
[expected for (M+H)+ 1267.53] for R8 and 1625.57 [expected for (M+
H)+ 1625.85] for FITC-R8.
2.2. Cell culture and incubation protocol
Ahumanmacrophage-like U-937 large-cell lymphoma cell linewas
maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco BRL, Life Technologies, Inc.,
Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum (FBS; Gibco) and 100 U/mL of penicillin/100 µg/mL
streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5% CO2 at
37 °C. The U-937 cell line was chosen because it is a well-established
human cell line with many monocytic characteristics and has been
extensively used as an in vitromodel for macrophage stimulation. For
microarray analysis, the U-937 cells (1×109) were treated with 10 µM
of R8 for 0.5 h (T1) and 4 h (T2). After they had been incubated, R8was
removed from themediumand the cellswerewashedwith phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) for further analysis. Negative control cells (T0)
contained no peptides. Each experiment was done twice.
2.3. Cytotoxicity assay
Dehydrogenase activity (an indicator of cell viability) in the treated
and untreated cells was simultaneously assessed. Negative control cells
contained no peptides. Ten microliters of a cell-counting kit (Cell
Counting Kit-8; Dojindo Laboratories, Japan) solution, a tetrazolium salt
that produces a highly water-soluble formazan dyewhen biochemically
reduced in the presence of an electron carrier (1-methoxy PMS)
(Dojindo Laboratories), was added to 100 µL of culture medium and
incubated for 4 h. The absorbance at 450 nm was obtained using an
ELISA reader with a reference wavelength of 595 nm. Results are
reported as the cell-viability percentage (average optical density (OD)/
average negative control OD)±standard deviation (SD).
2.4. Flow cytometric detection of R8 binding and uptake
The cells (1×106/mL)were treatedwith various doses of FITC-R8 for
the entire incubation period, as indicated. After the cells had been
incubated, the FITC-R8was removed from themediumandwashedwith
PBS for further analysis. The cells were then incubated with trypsin
(1 mg/mL) (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min at 37 °C to remove membrane-
bound peptides. The cells were washed once more with PBS, and then
cell ﬂuorescencewasmeasured using ﬂowcytometry (FACScan; Becton,
Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). A 15-mM air-cooled
argon-ion laser was used to excite ﬂuorescent FITC at 488 nm, and the
emitted ﬂuorescence was measured using a 530/30-nm band-pass
opticalﬁlter. Sampleswere runusing104 cells per test sample. Datawere
analyzed using the CELLQUEST programs. Negative control cells
contained 20 µM of FITC only, but no FITC-R8. In some experiments,
the trypsinization step was omitted in the washing protocol.
2.5. RNA puriﬁcation and microarray analyses
Total RNA was extracted using a reagent (Trizol; Invitrogen Corp.,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) and then a kit (RNeasy Mini; Qiagen GmbH, Hilden,
Germany). The puriﬁed RNA was quantiﬁed by increasing the optical
density to 260 nm (OD 260 nm) using a spectrophotometer (ND-1000;
Nanodrop Technologies, Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA) and qualitatively
analyzed using a bioanalyzer (Bioanalyzer 2100; Agilent Technologies,
Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA).Microarray experimentswere done following
the manufacturer's protocols. Brieﬂy, 0.5 µg of total RNA was ampliﬁed
using a kit (Fluorescent Linear Ampliﬁcation Kit; Agilent) and labeled
with Cy3-CTP (CyDye, Perkin-Elmer, Fremont, CA, USA) during the in
vitro transcription process. Two micrograms of Cy-labeled cRNA was
fragmented to an average size of about 50–100 nucleotides by
incubating it with fragmentation buffer at 60 °C for 30min. Correspond-
ingly fragmented labeled cRNA was then hybridized to a 4×44-k
microarray (Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray Kit; Agilent) at
60 °C for 17 h, and then scanned at 535 nm (Microarray Scanner;
Agilent) at 535 nm. The scanned images were analyzed using
commercial software (Feature Extraction 9.5.3; Agilent), as were the
microarray data (GeneSpring GX 7.3.1; Agilent). Chip intensities of six
microarray data from three duplicate time points (T0, T1, T2) were
normalized to equal signal distribution using per-chip normalization at
the 75th percentile. Per-gene normalization to time point 0 h (T0) was
also used. The resulting 28,060 genes were selected for differential
expression; 4386 differentially expressed geneswere selected using 1.5-
fold changes at one of three time points and the Signiﬁcance Analysis of
Microarray (SAM) method with a false-discovery rate (FDR) threshold
of 0.05. The differentially expressed genes were further analyzed with
cluster analysis. The gene ontology (GO) and gene annotations of each
cluster were classiﬁed with gene ontology annotation (GOA) and
proteome slim, which contains a list of general GO terms.
2.6. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR (Q-PCR)
The same RNA isolated for the microarray was used for RT-PCR. To
prepare a cDNA pool from each RNA sample, total RNA (5 µg) was
reverse transcribed using reverse transcriptase (Moloney Murine
Leukemia Virus Reverse Transcriptase; Promega, Madison, WI, USA)
and the resulting samples were diluted 40 times using a column with
nuclease-freewater. The speciﬁcity of each primer pair was tested using
a template (Universal Rat Reference RNA; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA),
for a real-time PCR reaction, and then a DNA 500-chip run on the
bioanalyzer to check the size of thePCRproduct. Real-timePCR reactions
were done on a thermal cycler (LightCycler Instrument 1.5; Roche
Diagnostics Australia Pty. Ltd., Castle Hill, Australia) using a kit
(LightCycler FastStart DNA MasterPlus SYBR Green I, Cat. 03 515 885
001; Roche). Each sample was run in triplicate. The real-time PCR
program stepswere 95 °C for 10min, 50 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for
15 s, and 72 °C for 10 s. Five genes (FOS, OSM, C1R, TNF, IL1R1) were
investigated using the following primer sequences: FOS sense CTAC-
CACTCACCCGCAGACT and antisense AGGTCCGTGCAGAAGTCCT; OSM
sense GTGGATGAGAGGAACCATCG and antisense GTAGCAGAGGGGAA-
CAGGTTT; CIR sense TGCTCAACTACGTGGACTGG and antisense GATTC-
GAACCTAGTGAATTCTGG; TNF sense CAGCCTCTTCTCCCCTTCGAT and
antisense GCCAGAGGGCTGATTAGAGA; IL1R1 sense ATTGTGCTTTGGTA-
CAGGGATTCC and antisense ATGCGTCATAGGTCTTTCCATCTG. Human
TBP (TATA box binding protein) was used as the reference gene.
2.7. Intracellular O2
− content
Cell suspensions (1×106/mL) with or without R8 treatment were
incubated with 10 µM of hydroethidine (HE) incubated for 15 min at
37 °C. HE is oxidized primarily by O2- and forms ethidium bromide
(EB), which emits red ﬂuorescence [15]. The cells were then analyzed
on the ﬂow cytometer. Samples were run using 10,000 cells per test

3. Results
3.1. Cytotoxicity assay
To assess the cytotoxic effect of R8, we incubated U-937 cells for 4,
8, and 24 h with various concentrations of R8 (2, 5, 10, 20, and 40 µM).
Cell viability was above 80% at the concentrations used (Fig. 1A). The
limited cytotoxicity of R8 was consistent with a previous report [13]
on R8-treated RAW 264.7 macrophages. U-937 cells were also treated
with increasing concentrations of FITC-R8, after which they were
analyzed using cytotoxic assays (Fig. 1B). FITC-R8 also showed limited
toxicity, which conﬁrmed that FITC labeling did not increase the
cytotoxicity of R8.
3.2. R8 binding and uptake
Flowcytometry does not distinguish between cellmembrane-bound
and internalized ﬂuorochrome. Therefore, we treated the cells with
trypsin to remove surface-bound peptide before a FACS analysis of the
cellular uptake of FITC-R8. Cells incubated with FITC-R8 but without
trypsin treatment showed higher ﬂuorochrome levels than those with
trypsin treatment (Fig. 2). Also, the binding and internalizationwere not
due to thedissociation of FITC fromR8,which is shown in cells incubated
withFITConly (Fig. 2A, curve b). Thebindinganduptakeof FITC-R8were
rapid, as the increases in ﬂuorescence for 0.5 h of exposure show
(Fig. 2B). The kinetic analysis of the binding and uptake of cells treated
with FITC-R8 showed time- and concentration-dependent increases in
cell ﬂuorescence (Fig. 2B–D). The differences in the ﬂuorescence of cells
withandwithout trypsin treatmentwere smaller after 8hof exposure to
FITC-R8 (Fig. 2D), which indicated that the uptake of FITC-R8was nearly
completed.
3.3. Global gene expression proﬁles of U-937 macrophages treated with
R8
A common characteristic of cell penetrating peptide delivery is that
cells quickly uptake it. Therefore, we obtained global gene expression
proﬁles for U-937 human macrophages incubated with and without
10 µM of R8 for 0.5 h and 4 h. We used 1.5-fold changes at one of three
time points (0 h, 0.5 h, and 4 h) to select 4386 differentially expressed
genes from 28,060 identiﬁed genes; cluster analysis was then used for
additional analysis. We found 11 clusters with signiﬁcant gene
expression changes (Fig. 3). Themajority of these geneswith signiﬁcant
gene expression changes at each time point (0.5 h and 4 h) were
upregulated (Table 1); 35 upregulated genes responded to the stimuli
with immune functions in all 11 clusters and were also selected
(Table 2). These genes included mostly cytokines, cytokine binding
proteins, cytokine receptors, receptors, histocompatibility molecules,
chemokines, complement components, CD8 antigens, pore-forming
proteins, oncogenes, proteases, and phospholipases.

in R8-treated macrophages, TNF receptors are downregulated by nona-
arginine in HeLa cells [24]. Our results showed that the gene regulation
of TNF receptors by arginine peptides was dependent on cell-type
speciﬁcity and the length of thepeptide used. Also, the proinﬂammatory
cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were not released after the uptake of
R8. Therefore, these proinﬂammatory genes did not fully convert into
ﬁnal protein products after longer incubation times (8 h to 24 h). Our
study also showed that the increase of intracellular O2- production in R8-
treated macrophages occurred primarily after 0.5 h of incubation.
Microarray analysis showed that no genes related to superoxide
production had been upregulated in R8-treated cells, but that two
genes – NCF1 (neutrophil cytosolic factor 1; GenBank #: NM_000265)
and SOD3 (superoxide dismutase 3; GenBank #: NM_003102) – related
to superoxide metabolism had been upregulated after 4 h of incubation
(data not shown). This reﬂected the delicate balance between the
production and destruction of superoxide in R8-treated macrophages.
Polyargininewith amolecular weight less than 5000 does not induce O2-
content in macrophages, while polyarginine with a molecular weight
more than 104 does [25]. In the present study, however, we showed that
R8 with a molecular weight less than 5000 stimulated transient
production of O2- in macrophages after 0.5 h of incubation. Finally,
ﬂow cytometric analysis cannot determine whether internalized R8 is
intact or degraded. Proteases on the cell membrane may degrade R8.
Although FITC was used to evaluate the ﬂuorescence of intracellular R8
uptake, it acted as a cargo attached to R8. The effect of attached cargo on
the proﬁling of immune responses to macrophages must be further
investigated.
5. Conclusion
We described the interaction of R8 with a phagocytic cell line (U-
937) that is representative of a target in the body during drug delivery.
Despite low cytotoxicity, R8 induced various changes in gene expression
in macrophages after it had bound with and was internalized by them.
Exposing U-937 cells to R8 did not stimulate the release of any
proinﬂammatory cytokines (TNF-α, Il-1β, or IL-6). After U-937 macro-
phages had been incubatedwith R8 for 0.5 h, intracellular O2- production
was detected, but this did not lead to cell death. Our study may provide
helpful information about the molecular action of cell penetrating
peptides in macrophages for delivering therapeutic substances.

二、與會心得 
這次我報告的壁報論文，被大會安排在第二天，整天的基因製劑壁報論文場次中張貼並與其他有
興趣的研究學者一同討論，在壁報張貼期間許多相關領域的專家都前來參觀壁報，也提出許多有
用的意見及討論，使我能知道自己研究的盲點何在及本實驗在生技製藥界的價值及重要性，因此
受益匪淺。此外在會議進行期間也有許多出版社、廠商設攤展示，進行一連串示範及演講活動，
對於往後在研究中所使用相關材料及儀器亦十分有所幫助。
