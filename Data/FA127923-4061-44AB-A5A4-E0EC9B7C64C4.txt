2be solved by the MPSO method for the minimization of the
production cost with considering customer load demands,
spinning reserve capacity and the steady-state security
constraints. In addition, the valve-point loading effect and
the ramp rate limit of the thermal generator are also
integrated into the objective function. The calculation
processes of the HCPSO algorithm involved in solving the
UC problem are explained in detail below.
II. PROBLEM FORMULATION
The objective of UC in a power system is to minimize
total generation cost, while observing a large set of
operation constraints. The total generation cost includes the
production cost of the scheduled combination units and the
transition cost. The transition cost is the sum of the start-up
cost and the shut-down cost, which is the cost associated
with changing from one combination of power-producing
units to another combination. Problem formulation of the
unit commitment must satisfy the system constraints, the
generating unit constraints, and the system security
constraints. System constraints included the power balance
and the spinning reserve requirement. Generating unit
constraints included the generation limit, the minimum
up/down time, the ramp-rate limit, and the valve-point
loading effect. System steady-state security constraints
included the transmission capacity limit and the bus
voltage limit. Regardless of the system is in a normal state
or a contingent state, the security constraints can ensure
that the system can secure operation.
A. Steady-state Security-Constrained DED
The steady-state security-constrained DED(SCDED)
formulation can be stated as:
xu
Min
,
),( )0()0( xuf (1)
s.t. 0),( )0()()( xug kk , for cNk ,...,1,0 (2)
0),( )0()()( xuh kk , for cNk ,...,1,0 (3)
where is x(o) a vector of control variables of
pre-contingency, such as power output of generator, while
u is the vector of state variables, such as bus voltage and
reactive power output of generator. Objective function (1)
is scalar. Equalities (2) are the conventional power
equations. Inequalities (3) are the limits on the control
variables x, and the operating limits on the power system.
The superscript “o” represents the pre-contingency
(base-case) state being optimized, and superscript “k”(k>0)
represents the post-contingency states for the Nc
contingency cases. So, the equality constraints g(o) change
to g(k) to reflect the outage equipment. Performing the
SCDED scheduling, if a vector of control variables x of
pre-contingency while satisfying all equality and inequality
constraints during whole operation period, regardless of
whether the system is in a pre-contingent state or a
post-contingent state, is a feasible operation point that can
ensure the system to locate in the security region.
B. Valve-Point Loading Effect
Because the constraints of valve-point loading effect
of thermal generating units are considered, the fuel cost
function of unit i in (12) is defined as:

4D. Hybrid MPSO to UC
In this paper, the UC problem is considered as two
linked optimization sub-problems: the unit-scheduled
problem that can be solved by using the BMPSO method
for a feasible unit-committed combination and the
minimization of the transition cost, and the optimal
economic dispatch (ED) problem that can be solved by
using the MPSO method for the minimization of the
production cost. When one combination of generating units
has the lowest associated generation cost, it will be an
optimal solution.
IV. DEVELOPMENT OF PROPOSED METHOD
A. Representation of Individual String
Before using the BMPSO algorithm to solve the
combinatorial optimization problem generating units, the
representation of a particle must be defined. A particle is
also called an individual. Hence, we defined each
generator’s status (ON(‘1’)/OFF(‘0’)) as a gene, al 
available generators’ status at each hour make up a 
sub-chromosome, and there are 24 sub-chromosomes in
one day (T=24) comprising an individual. An individual
would display the generator commitment schedule in one
day. For example, if there are five generating units
supplying the power to meet the load demand in a system,
the dimension of an individual is 5×24. Figure 2 shows a
matrix representation of an individual xl in the population.
When the size of the population is L, the dimension of the
population is equal to 5×24×L. We can use the row values
of the matrix to judge whether each scheduled unit satisfies
the MUT/MDT constraints, and to solve the transition cost
during the entire scheduling period. We can use the column
values to solve the ED solution and the production cost.
Figure 2 shows the procedures for generating feasible
combination solutions and constructing an initial
population.

B. BMPSO-based to UC
The search procedures of the proposed BMPSO
method for solving the UC problem are shown below. In
addition, the best individual should have the lowest total
generation cost of objective function, and also satisfy
system constraints of the UC problem. Therefore, in the
proposed method, we define the fitness function as (5).
Thus, better individuals will generate better evaluation
values.
Step 1 To generate randomly many individuals according
to Fig. 2, each individual xl is a matrix with the
dimension equal to Ng×L. Ng is the number of
generators and T is the number of scheduling
periods. Each individual can be represented as Fig.
2.
Step 2 To test whether every individual is a feasible
combination or not, each feasible combination must
satisfy system constraints. Selecting those feasible
combinations makes up a population X by X=[x1,
x2, … , xL]’, where L is the size of the population.
The population is a three-dimensional matrix with
the dimension equal to Ng×T×L.
Step 3 Calculate the evaluation value of each individual xl
using the evaluation function given by (5). The
evaluation value is the sum of production cost and
transition cost.
Step 4 Compare each individual’s evaluation value with the 
individual’s Pbest. The individual who owns the best
evaluation value is set to be Gbest.
Step 5 Modify the member (gene) velocity vl of each
individual xl according to (20) and

Individual xl
6a population are 6×12 and 6×12×30, respectively. Through
many experiments, the parameters of HMPSO in Table III
are used.
The proposed method yielded simulation results
including the production cost, transition cost, and spinning
reserve capacity of each scheduling time interval,
unit-scheduled for 24-hour duration and the total
generation cost as shown in Tables IV(a)-IV(b).
As seen in Table IV(a), without considering the
steady-state security constraints, the total generation cost
of the best combination of scheduled units is $95,022.0;
while it is $95,105.3 with considering the steady-state
security constraints, as shown in Table IV(b). Though the
total generation cost of later is higher, the security of
system is better. Figure 3 shows the curve of the scheduling
generation and load demand.

C. Case III : Modified IEEE 118-Bus System
The system contains ten thermal units, 118 buses and
41 transmission lines. The upper and lower limits of the
PV-bus and load-bus voltages are 0.90 pu and 1.1 pu,
respectively. From the result of contingency selection, the
critical fault is proven when line 17-18 faulted then line
15-17 and line 15-19 were overloaded. The detailed
characteristics of the 10 thermal units are given in Table
AV in the Appendix. Bus 69 is the reference bus. The bus
data, branch data and transformer-tap data of the system
can be found in [16].
The unit commitment problem consisted of 10 units
and a 24-hour scheduling horizon, that is Ng=36 and T=24.
In this simulation, the dimensions of an individual and a
population are 36×24 and 36×24×100, respectively. The
parameters of HMPSO in Table VIII are used. The spinning
reserve (SR) requirements were assumed to be greater than
10% of the load demand in the study system. The load
demand data for this problem is shown in Table IX.
The proposed method yielded simulation results that
are shown in Tables IX. Due to the space limit, only the
total generation cost of the best combination of scheduled
units is shown. As seen in Table IX, considering the
steady-state security constraints, the total production cost is
$ 838,157, the transition cost is $17,690, and the total
generation cost of the best combination of scheduled units
is $855,847
