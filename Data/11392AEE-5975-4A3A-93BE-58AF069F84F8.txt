The Correction of Geared Rotor-Bearing System 
under Residual Bow Effect by Using the 
Optimization Algorithms with Behavior 
Constraints 
 
 
One efficient correcting procedure for the geared rotor-bearing system with 
residual bow effect is presented in this paper. Owing to long time working and wear, the 
residual shaft bow of geared rotor-bearing system will take place in the shaft and the 
system vibration will be enlarged. Replacing a new shaft is one of the fast method to 
correct this effect due to residual bow, but replacing a new one is a waste of the cost. 
This paper applies the optimization algorithms to correct this effect instead of replacing 
any components of the system. The constraint of critical spin speed is considered in the 
correcting process. The genetic algorithm and augmented Lagrange multiplier method 
are individually used to be the optimization algorithms for the correction. As the results 
shown, the influence due to the residual bow effect can be improved with altering the 
positions of bearing supports. Also, the cost of correction can be reduced by abridging 
the replacing any components. 
1.  INTRODUCTION 
The geared rotor-bearing system is a principal part of the mechanisms in present 
age, especially for high spin speed mechanisms. On account of the increasing demand 
for high speed and high accuracy transportation, the research in this field becomes very 
important. With a long time working and wear, the residual shaft bow will take place in 
the shaft due to the unbalance forces from disk eccentricity, permanent disk skew and 
so on. The system vibration will be enlarged with the residual shaft bow effect. 
In rotor-bearing system, many authors showed that the system parameters 
influence the dynamic characteristics of the rotor-bearing system significantly(1~5). 
Most literatures emphasized the analysis of lateral motion and discussed of the critical 
speeds, mode shapes and unbalance response. Nelson(6) established the shape functions 
3 
 
damping and stiffness coefficients denoted as bjc  and 
b
jk . A fixed reference frame, 
X-Y-Z, is used to describe the system motion. The single shaft system with a rigid disk 
in the Y-Z plane is shown in Fig. 1(b), and each nodal point of shaft considers five 
degrees of freedom V , W ,  ,   and  . 
The equations of motion had been described clearly in Shiau’s(23). For one disk, 
the equation of motion is

Fig. 1 The configuration of the geared rotor-bearing system(23) 
The gear pair in this paper is modeled as the equivalent stiffness hk  along the 
pressure line between the teeth, which is shown in Fig. 1(c). )(tet  is the displacement 
transmission error, which is assumed as a sinusoidal with tooth passing frequency as 
)sin()sin()( 11 tNetete ttttt   (2) 
where 1tN  is the number of teeth of the driving gear and 1  is the spin speed of shaft 1.

of the system vibration is considered as the objective. The corresponding transmitted 
force bjF  at the

functions. The positions of bearing supports are considered as the design variables. 
Differ from the optimization design, the equivalent stiffness of the gear pair, bearing 
stiffness and damping coefficients are not considered as the design variables. For the 
reason that this correction is not a new optimization design, the gear fixed on the shaft

Case 1: Single-objective correction of disk 
Two single objective corrections are presented individually in this case. The 
objective functions are 
Minimization: max.( diskR1 ) and (
diskR2 ), individually     (11) 
Table 2 and Fig. 3 show the correcting results of single- objective correction for 
disk 1. The maximum lateral response of disk 1 can be reduced greatly, but the third and 
fourth critical spin speeds of shaft 1 take place in the spin speed range after this 
9 
 
more than the reducing rate of single-objective correction of disk 1. Although both of 
the correcting objectives can respectively be arrived in this case, the vibrations of 
non-objective shaft are increased evidently at the same time.

Case 2: Multi-objective correction of disks 
The objective of this correction is considered as 
Minimization: max.( diskR1 ) and (
diskR2 ), simultaneously (12) 
In the case above, the maximum lateral responses of non-objective disk are altered 
slightly and even be increased. This case considers both of the maximum lateral 
responses of disk 1 and disk 2, and that are reduced simultaneously as shown in Table 3 
and Fig. 5.  Both the first critical spin speeds with two kinds of corrections are still 
closed to the low bound. The reducing rates are not great as the single-objective 
corrections, but which are better than the responses with residual bow effect obviously. 
With the correction by GA, four critical spin speeds occur in shaft 1 and the maximum 
11 
 
Case 3: Multi-objective correction of corresponding transmitted forces 
Not only the vibration of gear-pair is important but also the responses of bearing 
supports. The later responses of disks are reduced in case 1 and case 2, but some of the 
corresponding transmitted forces are increased at the same time. Single objective 
corrections of each the corresponding transmitted force are not presented in this paper, 
and all the transmitted forces in bearing supports are selected as the objective in this 
case simultaneously. As shown in Table 4, all the reducing values of the corresponding 
transmitted forces can rise more than 250 (N).   But the forces are still larger more than 
the system without residual effect. The responses of the disks are also reduced slightly 
with the reducing of the vibrations in bearing supports. The first critical spin speed of 
each shaft is not closed to the low bound of the behavior constraint any more in this 
correction.

In those cases, the GA sometimes can get the better results than ALMM but not for 
all cases. For the reason that selecting the initial design values is important for 
traditional optimization methods. Different initial values sometimes cause different 
optimum results, especially for the multi-objective correction. That is the reason why 
the correction results in each case are not the same. Furthermore, the multi-objective 
design doesn’t generally produce the only optimum design values and results. All the 
objectives can be arrived in the cases above, but the numbers of critical spin speed are 
increased in some cases. Some of the increasing critical speeds are obvious in figures. 
The resonance in instantaneously is harmful for the accelerated or retarded process of 
the system. But that is not considered into the correction in this paper.
