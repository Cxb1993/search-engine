the design for this type of filter is highly 
flexible. The main advantages of this type of 
LTCC bandpass filter are easy to miniaturize 
the size of filter and to generate more 
attenuation poles by using the higher orders. 
However, in general, the distributed inductor 
and the lumped capacitor for such a filter 
were implemented by the more layers of 
electrode and dielectric both contributing to a 
high insertion loss of this type LTCC filter.

 The other is comb-line filter, from circuit 
point of view, it comprises of a pair of couple 
lines of less than a quarter-wavelength and 
lumped capacitors[8]. The resonators are 
electro-magnetically coupled for constructing 
a multi-pole filter.  One open end of each 
line resonator is connected the grounded 
capacitor to shorten the length of resonator. 
From 3-D physical structure point of view, 
there is no vertical via to connect between 
these electrode layers, so the freedom of 3D 
design is low. In general, this type of filter is 
described as the laminated planar filter and 
consists six layers of dielectric and five layers 
of conductor layers. The layout of this type of 
filter is very simple leading to the low 
insertion loss in passband of filter. However, 
this type of filter is more difficult to reduce 
the physical size and to generate more 
attenuation poles due to via-free.  
 
Therefore, the main objective of this paper 
is to describes a laminated planer filter, which 
is designed basically in the same manner as in 
Toshioishizas’s work[9]. The novel LTCC 
comb-line filter topology described in this 
paper offers two distinct features. Besides, it 
was implemented by the laminated planar 
configuration to allow a compact size and 
simple process, a new circuit schematic is also 
proposed to have two independent 
transmission zeros located at arbitrary 
frequency or to have three dependent 
transmission zeros.  
 
II. Structure of Planner Filter  
Fig.1 show the novel structure of the 
laminated planer filter. There are four 
dielectric layers (excluded two cover-layers) 
and five conductor layers in a stripline 
configuration. It is worthy noting that the 
main difference in the novel 3D multilayer 
structure is on the third layers compared with 
the previous studies[10 ].

III. Performance analysis 
To easily derive the Y matrix of the 
proposed schema, the overall ABCD matrix 
for the proposed schematic without feedback 
capacitor Cb as shown in Fig.3 that is the sum 
of those for two Li Ci resonators, a pair of 
parallel stripline resonator and two Cr 
capacitors is shown as followings:

Find the Y matrix of filter by cascading the 
ABCD matrix of the sum of those for two Li 
Ci resonators, a pair of parallel stripline 
resonator and two Cr capacitors. 
 
 
 
 
 
Network theory relates the scattering 
parameter S21 of the filter to the admittance 
matrix elements by the following formula  
 
 
 
 
Where Y0 represents the characteristic 
admittance of the I/O ports, set to 50 W in this 
study. The finite transmission zeros of the 
filter are located at the frequency where 
S21(w)=0 or Y21(w)=0. Evidently, there are 
two finite transmission zeros for this filter. 
One is from a pair of parallel stripline 
resonator, the other is from the Li Ci resonator.  
The calculated results for transmission 
characteristic of the filter are respectively 
shown in Fig. 4 and 5 regarding values of Li, 
Ci and the gaps between two striplines. It is 
clearly to see this filter has two independent 
finite transmission zeros, one is in the lower 
stopband that can be controlled by varying the 
value of Ci and Li without changing the 
frequency of the finite transmission zero in 
the upper stopband.

capacitance of feedback capacitor on the 
S-parameters of the filter. 
As shown in Fig.7, the locations of the 
two finite transmission zeros (I) and (II) in the 
low stopband expand outward with increasing 
the capacitance of feedback capacitor from 
0.001, 0.004 to 0.01pF. In addition, the finite 
transmission zero (III) in the upper stopband 
shift toward the low frequency as the 
capacitance of feedback capacitor increases. 
In other words, the transmission zero (I) in 
low stopband shifts toward the low frequency 
with increasing the capacitance of feedback 
capacitor. On the other hand, transmission 
zero (II) in the low stopband, and 
transmission zero (III) in the upper stopband 
shrink inward with increasing the capacitance 
of feedback capacitor. The effect of 
capacitance of feedback capacitor on the 
S-parameter for transmission zero (II) and (III) 
is well agreed with the previous studies by 
Yeung[11].

IV. Laminated Planar Filter Implementation 
by using LTCC technology 
The layout-out of 3-D multilayer structure 
for the proposed novel laminated planar 
LTCC filter as shown in Fig.1 is implemented 
by using LTCC technology. There are six 
dielectric layers (included four dielectric 
layers and two cover-layers) and five 
conductor layers in a stripline configuration. 
The dielectric material is from Heraeus 6140 
and its relative permittivity is 7.8. This 
material is cofired with silver electrode 
conductive paste at 900°C for 30 min. The 
first and the fifth conductor layers are for 
ground layers, three kinds of capacitor in this 
lay-out, loaded capacitor, I/O capacitor and 
coupling capacitor are respectively realized 
on the second and the forth layers. The 
stripline resonator and inductor Li that is used 
to form another resonator with Ci are both 
realized on the third layer. 
 The results of EM simulation and 
measurement of the proposed laminated 
planar LTCC filter are shown in Fig.8. The 
dashed lines represent the EM simulated 
results by HFSS   and the solid lines 
represent the measured results. The overall 
size of the filter is 2.5x2.0x1.2mm3 as shown 
in Fig. 9. Evidently, the measured results are 
well agreed with the simulated results and are 
very promising. The insertion loss in the 
passband from 5.15GHz to 5.25Ghz is 1.9- 
2.0 dB. Three finite transmission zeros in the 
transmission response of the filter are 
respectively located at the 3.85, 4.6 and 
6.5GHz prescribed frequency range. The 
attenuation at these three transmission zeros 
are respectively 43dB , 45dB and 58dB. Two  
characteristics about the measured 
performance of filter are worthy noting.
