光合作用，若未妥善處理會對環境生態造成嚴重威脅及影響。處理染料廢水的技
術包括電透析、化學混凝、高級氧化程序、生物處理等法，但這些方法操作成本
高，經濟可行性不高。吸附法為另一項可行的處理技術，若能選用適當的吸附劑，
不但可以有效移除廢水中色度，具有低污泥量之優勢，已廣泛被廢水處理廠採用。 
傳統上，廢水處理廠最常使用之吸附劑為活性碳。但由於活性碳昂貴、再生
程序繁瑣且維護操作費用高，因此近年來有許多學者投入研發非傳統性之廉價吸
附材料。所謂非傳統性廉價吸附材，必須具備：價廉、本土性(降低運輸費)且來
源不虞匱乏、高吸附效能等要素。這些非傳統性吸附材料在廢水處理之操作維護
費低，有時候不必考慮再生，很適用於非開發中國家。過去研究指出，利用廢棄
物或低成本材料做為吸附劑可將染料有效的去除，例如廢白土(Weng and Pan, 
2006)、竹炭(Hameed et al., 2007)、小麥殼(Bulut and Aydin, 2006)、椰子殼纖維
(Kavitha and Namasivayam, 2007)等。根據農糧署農業統計年報，國內去年(2007)
茶葉種植面積 16,256 公頃，產量高達 17,502 公噸。茶飲製造業之茶葉渣量大，
可資源再利用成為有機堆肥原料或乾燥製成枕頭心。但是目前大部分茶葉渣仍以
一般廢棄物方式進入掩埋場或焚化爐。研究指出葉含高量的酚類化合物，可藉由
含多羥基團(polyhydroxyl groups)及 carboxyl groups 的特性可與金屬形成鉗合
物，去除水中重金屬(Amarasinghe and Williams, 2007; Malkoc and Nuhoglu, 2005; 
Hossain and Komita, 2005; Weng and Huang 2008)。本研究以開發本土性之生質廢
棄物為前提，將茶葉渣資源化製成廉價吸附材，非但可以達到廢棄物再利用之目
的，且可有效降低染料廢水之處理成本。目前有關廢棄茶葉渣應用於廢水處理之
去污研究不多；而廢棄茶葉渣之染料吸附特性及影響因子之探討更是少見。 
本研究選用本土性未發酵之廢棄茶葉渣(綠茶，GTLP)，將其資源再利用製
成廉價生質吸附劑。本文將揭發廢棄茶渣去除水溶液中鹼性染料的吸附效能及機
制。對吸附之關鍵條件影響包括混合速率、初始濃度、離子強度、pH 值、溫度
等將在本研究探討之。同時利用動力及平衡模式探討模式之適用性及分析吸附實
驗之數據，並以熱力學觀點來詮釋吸附反應機制。 
 
二、實驗材料與方法 
2.1 Methylene blue(MB) 
亞甲基藍（methylene blue, MB）為水溶解性之鹼性陽離子染料，分子式為
C16H18N3SCl (分子量為 319.85 g/mol)，其化學結構如圖 1 所示。MB 屬雜環芳香
族，芳香族上下兩端各包含氮及硫原子，左右兩側連接二甲胺基。水中 MB 濃度
之測定係使用分光光度計(HACH DR-2010)在波長 660 nm 下量測吸光值。 
 
2.2 吸附劑製備及特性分析 
廢棄綠茶葉(GTLP)採自某連鎖茶飲店，為了去除茶葉殘留之色度及雜質，

式中 KF 及 n = Freundlich 常數。 
 
三、結果與討論 
3.1 特性分析 
吸附前後 GTLP 之 SEM 影像如圖 2 所示，影像顯示茶葉粉表面為複雜多孔
性結構及粗糙組織，多孔且內陷深，可提供茶葉粉較多的吸附位址，以提升吸附
效能。茶葉粉之物化特性列於表 1。以 EDS 檢測綠茶葉粉之主要元素為 75.3%C、
23.7% O，屬於生質吸附劑。界達電位分析結果得知茶葉粉之零電位點(pHzpc)為
2.4，顯示在 pH > 2.4 時，水合後之 GTLP 表面帶負電荷，有利於帶正電荷 MB+
之吸附。由 FTIR 圖譜(圖 3)及分析吸附前後 GTLP 之主要官能基變化 (表 2)比較
結果，可推測吸附 MB 之主要官能基為–OH、–SO3、–C–C–、–CN、–NH。

3.2 動力吸附實驗 
3.2.1 混合速率對動力吸附之影響 
在批次的吸附系統中，混合速率對溶液中 MB 分子的擴散及 GTLP 表面邊界
層膜是具有相關性的。圖 4 為在初始 MB 濃度 5×10-5 M，離子強度 5×10-2 M，分
別以混合速率 100、200、300 rpm 進行動力吸附實驗之實驗結果。由圖可得知，
0.2 g/L GTLP 對 MB 5×10-5 M 之吸附平衡時間至少要 1 天以上，對於 MB 之 1 天
去除率僅約達 60%。若提高混合速率至 300 rpm 時，相同之實驗條件下，吸附平
衡時間不但縮短到 10 小時以內，且可將 MB 去除率提升至 70%。由於混合速率
愈快，達到平衡的時間愈快，推論可能是因為較快的混合速率使得 MB 分子能快
速的擴散吸附於 GTLP 表面上及更快通過邊界層膜達到內部孔隙。由圖 4 得知，
在初始階段，GTLP 對 MB 之吸附量大，且能夠在短時間內快速去除 MB，約在 2
小時以內可去除平衡吸附量之 80%以上；而隨著接觸時間之延長，吸附量持續的
增加，直到吸附平衡。此種初始的快速吸附伴隨著漸增吸附之行為，為一般多孔
隙吸附材所常見的現象。

所模擬曲線，高 r2 值且與實際之實驗數據較契合，因此 PSO 模式可適用於分析
GTLP 對於 MB 之動力吸附。由表 3 之 PSO 模式分析數據顯示，GTLP 能快速將
MB 吸附去除，當初始 MB 濃度由 8×10-6 M 增加至 1×10-4 M 時，反應 1 天後，
平衡吸附量可由 3.28×10-5 增加至 2.84×10-4 mol/g ；但反應速率 k 值則隨著初始
濃度之增加而漸減。

3.2.4 Intraparticle diffusion equation (IPD)  
由 q vs. t1/2繪製關係圖，假如圖中呈現兩條以上截線，通常表示各吸附階段
是獨立的。IPD 可分三階段(Ugurlu et al. 2005): (1)外部薄膜擴散–經由分子擴散作
用，吸附質由溶液移傳至外部吸附劑表面；(2)內部擴散–吸附質由吸附劑表面移
傳至內部之吸附位址；(3)吸附質進入孔隙內部表面之吸附位址。在動力實驗之
過程，基本上大致可看到:非常快速之外部表面吸附之第 1 階段，階段慢速漸進
吸附之第 2 階段，漸入平衡之第 3 階段。但實際上，大部份在文獻中所看的實驗
數據 IPD 分析圖，大多僅能呈現第 2 及第 3 階段；有關第 1 階段部份，因量測
數據之不足通常無法顯現。本研究之動力實驗數據經套用 IPD 結果如圖 8 及 9
所示，僅呈現兩條截線，顯示吸附動力過程為一多重階段所掌控。由於第一實驗
取樣點於 5 分鐘時，預期 5 分鐘之內 IPD 理論吸附過程第一階段之外部薄膜擴
散部分已經快速完成。因此圖中並未明顯看到第一階段之截線。如圖 8 所示，第
一條較陡之截線可代表第二階段之內部擴散遵循著內孔隙擴散；而約 2 小時以
後，圖中之第二條線則為第三階段之進入孔隙內部吸附位址後漸進平衡階段。
IPD 圖分析結果之第二階段（第一條）截線之截距並非為零（未通過原點），顯
示整個吸附動力機制並非單獨由 IPD 所掌控。 
由前述可推知 GTLP 吸附 MB 機制為一多重階段之程序：MB 分子快速擴散
至 GTLP 表面，通過邊界層膜慢速地向內部擴散附著於 GTLP 孔隙內部，最後吸
附於內孔隙位址而達平衡。若將 IPD 三階段之線性截線之斜率定義為速率，kpi 
(i=1,2,3)。表 5 所列為 IPD 分析係數。高 r2 值顯示 IPD 模式之適用性，亦表 MB
分子吸附於 GTLP 主要取決於擴散速率大小。當 MB 濃度由 3×10-5 增至 1×10-4 M
時，MB 對 GTLP 之 kp2 值由 4.06×10-5 增至 1.19×10-4 mol/(min1/2-g)，顯示出在高
MB 濃度狀態下有利於擴散；而 kp3 值由 7.15×10-6 增至 1.76×10-5 mol/(min1/2-g)，
此階段應該與吸附位址的特性有關。較高 MB 濃度時 MB 分子較多，單位時間
吸附於 GTLP 表面的量也較多，因而增加吸附量。另外，當離子強度由 1×10-3 M
增至 1×10-1 M 時，MB 對 GTLP 之 kp2 值由 6.47×10-5 降至 4.10×10-5 mol/(min1/2-g)，
而 kp3 值也由 7.09×10-6 降至 5.84.×10-6 mol/(min1/2-g)。這些數值顯示，在高離子
強度狀態下，不利於 MB 擴散及吸附；造成上述 kp2 及 kp3 值之變化主要是因為
在高離子強度溶液中，MB+必須與高濃度之 Na+競爭 GTLP 之吸附位址。

實驗控制於初始MB濃度1×10-4 M，離子強度5×10-2 M，pH值控制在2-12之間，
26 oC條件下與0.2 g GTLP反應一天，達到吸附平衡後之實驗結果如圖12所示。實
驗結果顯示，pH値係為影響GTLP吸附MB之一項主要因子，當pH值愈高時，吸
附量也愈高。當pH由2.5升至12.0時，去除率由10%急遽上升至100%。依據吸附
劑的pHzpc (2.4)而言，當pH 遠大於 pHzpc時，GTLP的表面所帶之負電荷量也隨而
增加，因此與溶液中帶正電荷的解離MB+離子吸附量也隨之增加。 
有機物(如 GTLP)之電荷特性會隨著 pH 而變，通常在低於 pHzpc 時 (如
hydroxyl group, -OH, amine, -NH)會質子化(deprotonation)而產生帶正電荷狀況(如 
(R–OH2)+, (R–NH2)+)，而在pHzpc值附近會出現中性化之官能基(neutralized groups) 
(如(R-OH)o )在高於 pHzpc 時會產生離子化(ionization)之官能基(如(R-O)-)。在
GTLP 表面上，不論是中性化或離子化之官能基均可提供吸附位址給 MB+離子吸
附。現以簡易之表面複合形成模式(surface complex formation model)來描述茶葉

全吸附 MB 覆蓋，所以 GTLP 之 SSAMB (specific surface area)為 
SSAMB＝Qm×N×A                                                   (8) 
式中，Qm＝單層最大吸附量(mol/g)；N＝亞佛加厥數(6.023×1023 molecules/mol)；
A＝單個 MB 分子佔據吸附位址之表面積。Hahner 等人(1996)指出 MB 分子尺寸
為長 16.9Å、寬 7.4Å、厚度 3.8 Å，θ為 MB 分子於
(67.5o)。故 A 值依下式計算可得其值為 69.6 Å2。 
A＝16.9 Å×3.8 Å÷sinθ                                               (9) 
依式(9)計算 GTLP 之 SSAMB 為 135 至 190 m2/g。而以 BET-N2 法所測得 GTLP
之 SSA 僅為 3.691 m2/g，其值遠低於 MB 吸附法之 SSA 值。此因 BET-N2 法屬
氣相吸附，只能測定外部 SSA，MB 吸附法屬於液相吸附，可測定內部與外部之
SSA(Yukselen and Kaya, 2006)。因 GTLP 經水合後，MB 分子會進入 GTLP 內部
層，所以 MB 法之 SSA 較 BET-N2 法高。本文作者認

use of waste tea leaves has not yet been made completely. Normally waste leaves were used 
as a natural compost material or used as pillow stuff. It has been reported that the tea leaves 
contain some organic functional groups that can form a bonding complex with divalent metals 
3,4 and Cr(VI)5-8. Although recent researchers have shown the results of Cr(VI) sorption by 
waste tea leave, the removal mechanisms remains uncertain. Beside, adsorption kinetics only 
performed within a short period (less than 1 hr) which is inadequately to establish the 
adsorption isotherm.  
 
The present paper reports the results for kinetic and equilibrium studies of Cr(VI) adsorption 
onto waste tea leaf powder. Two types of tea leaves, green tea leaf and black tea leaf, were 
selected for studying the effect of fermentation on the adsorption.  Key parameters that may 
affect the adsorption including pH and temperature were evaluated. Both kinetic and 
equilibrium isotherm models were applied to establish the rate of adsorption, adsorption 
capacity and the mechanism of Cr(VI) adsorption onto TLP. Thermodynamic parameters for 
the present system were determined according to the isotherm data. Results of this study will 
be useful for using this natural waste as an economic bio-adsorbent in the removal of Cr(VI) 
from wastewater. 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Materials 
All chemical reagents used were of analytical grade and purchased from Pfaltz and Bauer Co. 
(Stamford, CT, USA). Chromium solution was prepared by dissolving a known quantity of 
potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) in double distilled water. Cr(VI) in the solution was 
analyzed by reaction with diphenylcarbohydrazide, and subsequently measuring the 
absorbance of the purple product using a spectrophotometer (HACH DR-2010, USA) at a 
wavelength of 540 nm. Waste tea leaves were collected from a chain store of tea shop. 
 
Depending upon the degree of fermentation during the tea manufacturing process, the full 
fermentation of black tea leaf (allow to oxidize) and without fermentation of green tea leaf 
(not to be oxidized) selected for evaluation of adsorption. To remove residual tea color and 
impurities and to gain more sites for adsorption, the leaves samples was received following 
pretreatment: To recover more activated sites for adsorption, the tea leaf samples were treated 
as follows: (1) wash with tap water several times and mix 1 kg leaf sample with 2 L distilled 
water; (2) place the solution in a high pressure cooker under a pressure of 70 kPa at 100oC for 
20 min cooking; (3) remove the supernatant and rinse the cooked sample with distilled water; 
(4) run the process from step (1) to (3) for a number of times until the supernatant is free of 
tea colour (tannins); (5) dry it in an oven at 105oC overnight. Prior to use, the dried-leaf was 
powdered by a grinder. Both green tea leaf powder (GTLP) and black tea leaf powder (BTLP) 
were sieved to pass an ASTM 100 mesh screen. The fraction finer than 0.149 mm was used as 
adsorbent. Some basic properties of tea leaf powder (TLP) were determined as follows. A 
scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi -4700, Japan) equipped with energy dispersive 
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS Horiba) was utilized to characterize the TLP for its morphology and 
element constituents. The specific surface area and pore volume of TLP were determined by a 
Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) N2 surface area analyzer (Beckman Coulter SA3100). The 
pH-dependence of the zeta potential of hydrolyzed TLP was determined instrumentally using 
a zeta meter (Laser Zee 3.0, Pen Kem Inc., Bedford Hills, NY). A FTIR (Fourier transform 
infrared spectroscopy) spectrophotometer Bruker Vector 22 for the range of 400 – 4,000 cm-1 
was used to identify the chemical components of TLP. The solid pH of TLP was measured by 
mixing a water suspension containing 0.2 g TLP and 10 mL distilled water for 30 min with a 
 2
micrographs generally show that the surface of TLP is mostly irregular and porous. It can be 
seen from Fig. 1a, that the blurred image showing the surface of raw GTLP particles may be 
covered by impurities. After pressure steam treatment, a clear porous image (Fig. 1b) with 
roughness surface is observed. Table 1 outlined the major characteristics of GTLP and BTLP 
after pretreatment. The results of EDAX analysis show that the major constituents of TLP 
particles are C and O. The low pH value of the TLP sample indicates that it can be considered 
as an acidic adsorbent. Fig. 2 shows the results of zeta potential of hydrolyzed GTLP, BTLP, 
and PAC as a function of pH. Basically, the two TLP samples have similar pH-dependence of 
zeta potential with respect to that of PAC. The pHzpc (zero point of charge) of both TLP 
samples was 2.4 as determined from Fig. 2, indicating the surface charge of TLP is pH-
dependent due to ionization of functional groups developed on its surface. Therefore, at a 
solution pH greater than the pHzpc, the TLP possesses a negatively charged surface which is 
favorable for adsorbing anionic Cr(VI). Results of TOC leaching (Fig. 3) show significant 
amount of organic matter leached from raw TLP at acidic and basic conditions. However, 
when TLP was treated by pressure steam, the leaching amount is decreased drastically. The 
release of organic substances is mainly accounted for the dissolution of tea tannins (catchins). 
It appears that the pretreatment has rendered less organic acid leaching, thereby minimizing 
the chances of Cr(VI) reduction reaction.

Fig. 4a, b and Table 2 show the results of FTIR spectroscopic analysis of GTLP before and 
after adsorption. As shown in Fig. 4a, the spectra present a number of adsorption peak, 
showing the complex nature of the tea leaves. The FTIR spectra of GTLP (Fig. 4a) shows an 
intense and broad band ranging from 3,300 to 3,500 cm-1, indicating bonded hydroxyl (–OH) 
group. The peak at 2,927 cm-1 was attributed to the aliphalic –CH group. The peaks at 2366 
and 1519 cm-1 indicated the existence of the amine (NH) group and secondary amide group,

Kinetic studies 
Fig. 5 shows the amount of Cr(VI) adsorbed on GTLP with time under different pHs (2.0–3.5) 
at a constant ionic strength (5×10-2 M). It is evident that all the kinetic curves exhibit a rapid 
adsorption to attain the equilibrium phases. Two phases were observed in all cases: (a) a rapid 
adsorption appeared within 60 min contact time, and (b) a progressive and much slower 
uptake occurred thereafter. After 8 days of contact time, the equilibrium adsorption was 
reached despite the variation of pH; the 10-day of contacting time was then used for the 
equilibrium study. In general, the fast adsorption could be attributed to a surface reaction 
process, whereas the progressive decrease of adsorption sites results in a slower adsorption 
reaction.  Results also indicated that the decrease of pH resulted in an increase of Cr(VI) 
removal. Despite the fact that the organic matter is a source of electron donor, supernatant 
Cr(III) was not be detected throughout the kinetic experiment indicating the reduction-
oxidation in the experiment may be neglected.

> GTLP (1.561 L/g-day). The kinetics of adsorption indicated that the removal of Cr(VI) onto 
waste tea leaves could be considered as a slow adsorption process whereupon the adsorption 
could attain for 10 days due to its porous nature and having high Cr(VI) adsorption capacity. 
In particular, the characteristics of adsorption kinetic and capacity are similar to that of power 
activated carbon. The findings revealed that the benefits of using this low-cost adsorbent, or 
so called eco-adsorbent, for the treatment of acidic wastewaters rich in Cr(VI) in general, such 
as electroplating wastewater.

It is speculated that the adsorption of Cr(VI) onto TLP is a multiple-step process involving 
transport of adsorbents from bulk solution to the surface of the adsorbents followed by 
diffusion into the interior of the pores. The intra-particle diffusion (IPD) equation original 
proposed by Weber and Morris13 was therefore used to identify the diffusion mechanism:   
qe = kp,it1/2 + Ci                                     (3) 
where kp,i (i = 1–3) is the IPD rate constant (mol/(min1/2-g)) at i step; Ci is the intercept which 
gives an idea about the thickness of the boundary layer; i.e., the larger the intercept, the 
greater the boundary layer effect14. There are three consecutive steps generally involve in the 
intra-particle diffusion15: 
(1) External (or) film diffusion: the transport of sorbate from bulk solution to outer surface of 
the sorbent by molecular diffusion. (2) Intra-particle (or) internal diffusion:  the transport of 
sorbate from the particles surface into interior pores of the particle. (3) Sorption: The sorption 
of the solute particles from the active sites into the interior surface of the pores. 
 
Most of studies did not see the first step of the process as the bulk solute transport (external 
surface adsorption) happens too fast to be measured. Only the second and the third steps can 
be identified experimentally. In the present study, the intra-particle diffusion plots are given in 
Figs. 7 and 8. It was found that a double linearly relationship was observed in both figures. 
Table 4 shows the corresponding model fitting parameters. The values of r2 are high 
indicating the adsorption mechanism follows the intra-particle diffusion process.  Since the 
first data points shown in Figs. 7 and 8 were taken after 10 min, it is reasonable to believe that 
the first step (external diffusion) has been completed. In this study, both Figs. 7 and 8 can 
only present the second step (intra-particle diffusion) and the third step (progress adsorption). 
As shown in these two figures, the first intercept line represents the second step which was 
happen within 1 day, while the second intercept line of the third step happens thereafter. The 
results of IPD fitting (Figs. 7 and 8) also show that the fist intercept line does not pass the 
origin indicating that the adsorption process was not controlled by intra-particle diffusion 
alone (i.e., the IPD is not the sole rate limiting step). This confirms that the adsorption of 
Cr(VI) onto both tea leaf powder and PAC was a multi-step process, involving adsorption on 
the external surface and diffusion into the interior pore of the adsorbent.  
 
As shown in Table 4, when pH drops from 3.5 to 2.0, the rate constant, kp,2, slightly increases 
from 3.03x10-4 to 4.03x10-4 mol/(min1/2-g), and the rate constant, kp,3, drastically increases 
from 4.68x10-5 to 3.13x10-4 mol/(min1/2-g). The increase of kp,2 indicates that condition of 
 8
while marked adsorption was observed under acidic condition. Based on the speciation 
diagram shown in Fig. 9b, the major chromate ions coexisting in solution are HCrO4− and 
CrO42− for the Cr(VI) concentration of 5×10−4 M. At pH less than 4, because 98% of the 
Cr(VI) species belong to HCrO4−, the adsorbed Cr(VI) specie is expected to be HCrO4−. At 
pH region between 4 to 8, the adsorbed chromate species are expected to be HCrO4− and 
CrO42−. At pH > 8, despite the fact that adsorption affinity of CrO42− is higher than OH− and 
it may exchange with OH− ion [Hu et al. 2005], the adsorbed amount is significantly low at 
alkaline condition.

Findings show that the adsorption appears affected much by the solution pH. Such 
dependence of adsorption on pH could be due in part to the fact that the surface charge of 
GTLP was greatly associated to the solution pH.  As shown previously the pHzpc of GTLP 
particles was 2.4. The GTLP has negatively charged surface at pH less than the pHzpc. The 
negatively charged surface is favorable for the adsorption of anionic chromate ions. Thus the 
adsorption of increased at a lower pH. Also, the lower adsorption at alkaline condition is 
attributed in part to the presence of excess OH- ions destabilizing chromium ions and 
competing with cationic chromium ions for the adsorption sites. The organic matters, in 
general, are variable charge with pH. Normally, at low pH they will (such as hydroxyl group, 
-OH, amine, -NH) will deproton and provide positively charge affinity for cationic ions. As 
shown in the results of FTIR analysis (Table 2), the tea leaves comprised of various functional 
groups, such as hydroxyl (-OH) and carbonyl (>C=O), which could also be influenced by the 
pH.  Both protonated (such as (R–OH2)+, (R–NH2)+) and neutralized groups (such as (R-OH)o ) 
could give activated site for anionic chromium adsorption.  By taking the hydroxyl group for 
example, the following bonding mechanisms are proposed as follows: 
R−OH2+ + HCrO4−  =  R−HCrO4 + H2O; for pH < pHzpc       (4a) 
or 
R–OHo   + HCrO4−  =  R−HCrO4 + OH−;   for pH < pHzpc       (4b)  
R–OHo  + CrO42−  =  R−CrO4−  + OH−  for pH > pHzpc       (5) 
where R represents the GTLP surface sites accounted for hydroxyl group; both R–HCrO4 and 
R–CrO4− are the formation of the bonding complexes. 
 
Adsorption isotherms 
Two well-known adsorption isotherms were used to fit the isotherm data. The Langmuir 
isotherm is applicable to describe monolayer adsorption onto a surface with a finite 
number of identical sites and assumes no immigration of adsorbate in the plane of the 
surface, which is given as:

Comparison of various low-cost adsorbents 
Table 6 lists the adsorption capacity, Qm, and the corresponding adsorption affinity, KL, of 
various adsorbents for the adsorption of Cr(VI) determined from the Langmuir isotherm. As 
shown in Table 6, the adsorption capacities of all adsorbents for Cr(VI) varied significantly;

Thermodynamic parameters 
The following thermodynamic parameters for the present adsorption system were calculated, 
including change in the standard free energy (ΔGo), enthalpy (ΔHo), and entropy (ΔSo):

where R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J/mol-K); T is the absolute temperature (K). The 
values of ΔHo and ΔSo were determined from the slopes and intercept, respectively, from the 
van’ Hoff plot. Table 7 lists the calculated thermodynamic parameters based on the above 
functions. The higher negative value of ΔGo was observed for the system with higher 
temperature, indicating a more energetically favorable condition for Cr(VI) adsorption. It is 
restated that the results of kinetic and isotherm experiments showed that both the rates of 
adsorption and adsorption capacity indeed increased with increasing temperature. This implies 
that the adsorption process is spontaneous with a high preference and more efficient 
adsorption of Cr(VI) onto GTLP at elevated temperature. Generally, the value of ΔGo for an 
ion-exchange mechanism is in the range of −1.91 to −3.82 kcal/mol29. It is to be noted that 
ΔGo value up to 4.78 kcal/mol (20 kJ/mol) is consistent with electrostatic interaction between 
adsorption sites and the metal ion (physical adsorption) while ΔGo values more negative than 
9.56 kcal/mol (40 kJ/mol) reflect the adsorption involving charge s sharing or transfer from 
the adsorbent surface to the metal ion to form a coordinate bond (chemisorption)30. As shown 
in Table 7, the magnitude of ΔG° ranged from -7.173 to -7.603 kcal/mol, indicating that the 
adsorption process is not attributed to ion exchange. Instead, it may be suggested that a weak 
surface complex reaction (Eqs. (4) and (5)) is the major mechanism responsible for chromate 
ion adsorption. The adsorption process can also be enhanced by electrostatic interaction as 
well, in particular when the adsorbent carried negatively charged surface. It must be noted 
here that the magnitude of the favorable columbic energy contribution to chromate adsorption 
is relatively small in comparison with the chemisorption energy31. Thermodynamically, the 
values of ΔGo and ΔH◦ (-4.27 kcal/mol) are negative, and the values of ΔS◦ (10.48 cal/mol K) 
are positive, suggesting that the adsorption reaction is spontaneous at high temperature and 
exothermic in nature.

CONCLUSIONS 
Waste tea leaf powder was tested for its possible utilization as a low-cost adsorbent for Cr(VI) 
removal in wastewater treatment. The adsorption kinetics data is well correlated to the 
modified Freundlich equation and the rate constant increased with decreasing pH and 
increasing temperature. It was observed that intra-particle diffusion involved in the adsorption 
process. The Freundlich model yielded a much better fit than the Langmuir model. Fitting of 
isotherm data showed that the maximum adsorption capacity increased with decreasing pH 
and increasing temperature. The maximum adsorption capacities of Cr(VI) at pH 2.0 are 
117.52 and 66.04 mg/g for the full fermentation of black tea leaf powder and without 
fermentation of green tea leaf powder, respectively, which has almost the same order of 
magnitude to the commercial activated carbon. Thermodynamic parameters suggest that weak 
surface complex reaction may involve in the adsorption and the reaction is spontaneous at

The ability of an unconventional bio-adsorbent, pineapple leaf powder (PLP) for the adsorption of methy-
lene blue (MB) from aqueous solution was studied. It was observed that intra-particle diffusion was
involved in the adsorption process and that the kinetic data ﬁtted well with a pseudo-second-order
equation. Fitting parameters revealed that the rate of adsorption increased with decrease in dye con-
centration and decrease in ionic strength while the mixing speed did not have a signiﬁcant effect on
adsorption. The adsorption was favorable at higher pH and lower temperature, and the equilibrium data
were well ﬁtted by the Langmuir isotherm. The maximum adsorption capacity varied from 4.68×10−4
to 9.28×10−4 mol/g when pH increases from 3.5 to 9.5. Thermodynamic parameters suggest that the
adsorption is a typical physical process, spontaneous, and exothermic in nature. The results revealed that
this agricultural waste has potential to be used as an economical adsorbent for the removal of methylene
blue from aqueous solution.

1. Introduction
Dyes are widely used as coloring agents in a variety of indus-
tries, such as textiles, cosmetics, pulp mills, leather, dye synthesis,
printing, foods, and plastics. Because many organic dyestuffs are
harmful to human beings and hazardous to aquatic organisms,
removal of dyestuffs from wastewater has received considerable
attention over the past decades. Among the numerous dye removal
techniques, adsorption is the preferred method and gives the
best results as it can be used to remove various types of color-
ing materials [1]. Activated carbon is the most widely employed
adsorbent for the removal of color from textiles due to its effective-
ness and high adsorption capacity; however, its use is still limited
because of high operating costs. The need for regeneration and dif-
ﬁculty of separation from the wastewater after use are also major
concerns associated with activated carbon. To lower the cost of
wastewater treatment, many researchers have focused on ﬁnding
non-conventional alternative adsorbents. Non-conventional adsor-
bents or so-called low-cost adsorbents are generally referred to
non-hazardous waste produced from industry, agriculture, and
biosorbents. Extensive lists and reviews of these types of adsor-
bent for contaminant removal have beenmade [1–10]. In particular,
the use of agricultural waste in adsorption system has been drawn

attention from a large number of researchers because: (1) it is
abundantly available; (2) most of the types of agriculture waste
are readily to be used and do not require a complex pretreatment
step or activation process before applications; (3) regeneration of
these adsorbents may not be necessary (unlike activated carbon,
where regeneration is essential); and (4) less maintenance and
supervision are required for the operation of the adsorption pro-
cess. Nevertheless, use of these cheap alternatives for wastewater
treatment remains limited due to both insufﬁcient documentation
in realwastewater systemsand thenecessityofpost-usagedisposal.
Pineapple is largely cultivated in tropical countries, such as
China, India, Thailand, Indonesia, and Taiwan. In Taiwan, the total
area of cultivated pineapple plants is 12,225acres and 439,872 tons
of pineapple are harvested annually, according to a 2006 report
from the Taiwan Council of Agriculture. Normally leaves on farm-
land are used as a natural compost material or burned on site after
the harvest, creating a point source of air pollution. The major con-
stituents of pineapple leaf are cellulose (70–80%), lignin (5–12%),
and hemicellulose [11]. Some studies have focused on improving
the use of this natural bio-adsorbent in short and ﬁber-reinforced
rubber composites [12,13] because the leaves of the pineapple plant
yield strong, ﬁne silky ﬁbers. Such uses of pineapple leaves are dou-
bly beneﬁcial, providing a natural adsorbent and decreasing the
amount of agricultural waste.
Despite that many low-cost adsorbents have been studied for
decontamination purposes, studies of the pineapple leaf as an
economical adsorbent for dye removal have not yet entered the

where qt represents the amount of adsorbed MB on the PLP sample
(mol/g) at time t (min), qe is the amount adsorbed at equilibrium
(mol/g), and k is the PSO rate constant (g/(molmin)). After integrat-

In a rapidly stirred batch reactor, the IPD is likely a slow process
and is therefore rate-determining [15]. The IPD equation originally
proposed by Weber and Morris [16] was used to identify the diffu-
sion mechanism:
qe = kpt1/2 + C (4)
where kp is the IPD rate constant (mol/(min1/2 g)) and C is the inter-
cept, which gives an indication of the thickness of the boundary
layer (i.e., the larger the intercept, the greater the boundary layer
effect [17]).
The Langmuir adsorption isotherm [18]was used to describe the
MB adsorption:
qe = KLCeQm1 + KLCe
(5)
where qe is the amount ofMB adsorbed at equilibrium (mol/g),KL is
the Langmuir adsorption constant (L/mol), Ce is the equilibriumMB
concentration (mol/L), andQm is themaximumadsorption capacity
(mol/g).
The graphical computer software, KaleidaGraphTM [19], was
used to perform a non-linear ﬁt of the experimental data. In apply-
ing the above models to describe the kinetic data, the least-squares
correlation coefﬁcient (r2) and normalized standard deviation (s, %)
were calculated for each experiment. The value of s was calculated
using:
s = 100 ×
√∑
[(qt,exp − qt,cal)/qt,exp]2
n − 1 (6)
where qt,exp and qt,cal are, respectively, themeasured and calculated

points.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Adsorbent characteristics
The SEM micrograph of a typical PLP sample at 1000× magniﬁ-
cation depicted in Fig. 1 shows that the surface of PLP is porous. A
pore volume of 0.021mL/g and a speciﬁc surface area of 5.24m2/g
were measured. The density of PLP is 1.53g/cm3, which shows that
the gravitation method can be used to separate the adsorbent. The
pH value of PLP is 6.42, indicating that this natural material can be
considered a neutral adsorbent. The result of zeta potential mea-
surements shows that the pHzpc of PLP sample is 2.3. Therefore,
at a solution pH greater than the pHzpc, the PLP possesses a neg-
atively charged surface, which is favorable for adsorbing cationic
MB. The main ingredients of PLP are cellulose, hemicellulose, and
lignin. The FTIR spectra of PLP show an intense and broad band
ranging from 3050 to 3750 cm−1 due to the hydrogen-bonded OH
vibration of the cellulosic structure of PLP [12]. A strong and sharp
bandat2910 cm−1 is attributed to theC–Hstretchingvibration from
CH2 group of cellulose and hemicellulose. The peak at 1735 cm−1 is
due to C–O stretching of carbonyl groups (>C O) in hemicellulose.
The peaks at 1435 and 1255 cm−1 indicate the existence of lignin
and hemicellulose structures, respectively [20]. Bands at 1400 and
1060 cm−1 reﬂect the C N and C O stretches [11]. From the FTIR
spectra, it is clear that some surface functional groups are present
on the PLP, but the speciﬁc surface functional groups are unclear.

3.2. Kinetic studies
3.2.1. Effect of agitation speed
In the batch adsorption systems, agitation speed plays a sig-
niﬁcant role in affecting the external boundary ﬁlm and the
distribution of the solute in the bulk solution [21]. The results
showed that the adsorption equilibrium of MB almost remained
unchanged as agitation speed was increased. A similar trend was
observed for varying agitation speeds at different times. These
observations can be explained by the fact that the boundary layer
resistance was very small and the mobility of the system was high
under the experimental conditions. In other words, the diffusion
of the MB ion from the solution to the surface of the PLP and into
the pores occurred quickly and easily. Since the uptake of MB was
not signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the degree of agitation, an agitation
speed of 200 rpm was therefore used for all further experiments.
3.2.2. Effect of ionic strength

at various initial concentrations. The amount adsorbed increased

increase in ionic strength leads to a decrease in EDL thickness and
an increase in the amount of indifferent ions approaching the PLP
surface. Thus, the results shown above can be attributed in part to
increased competition between MB and Na+ ions for surface sites
with increasing the ionic strength.
3.2.3. Effect of initial MB concentration
Results show that increased initial MB concentration led to
increased MB adsorption. Apparently, the initial MB concentration
plays an important role in affecting the capacity of MB to absorb
onto PLP. The higher the MB concentration is, the stronger the driv-
ing force of the concentration gradient, and therefore the higher
the adsorption capacity. The corresponding PSO model ﬁt param-
eters (given in Table 1) indicate that the data can be described by
this model with relatively low standard deviation and high correla-
tion coefﬁcient. It was found that the adsorption rate was inversely
proportional to the initial MB concentration. When initial MB con-
centration increased from 5×10−6 to 4×10−5 M, the PSO rate
constant k2 decreased from 9.09×105 to 3.33×104 g/(molmin).
Higher initial MB concentration resulted in a lower diffusion efﬁ-
ciency and more competition of adsorbing ions for a ﬁxed activated
surface site; consequently, a lower k2 value was observed. Similar
results have also been reported by Crini et al. [21] for the adsorption
of dyes onto cyclodextrin-based peat.
3.2.4. Intra-particle diffusion
Normally, if a plot of the amount of dye adsorbed versus t1/2
shows twoormore intercepting lines, the adsorption steps are inde-
pendent of one another [22]. The IPD plots and the ﬁt parameters
of the effect of ionic strength are depicted in Fig. 4. These plots
clearly exhibit two distinguishable intercepting lines, which indi-
cate that the adsorption process was controlled by a multi-step
process, involving adsorption on the external surface and diffu-
sion into the internal pores of the PLP. The ﬁrst intercepting line
represents IPD while the second indicates the solution was pro-
gressively reaching equilibrium adsorption. The slope of the ﬁrst
linear portion gives the intra-particle rate constant, kp, and the
interceptof thisportion isproportional to the thicknessof boundary

The values ofH◦ andS◦ weredetermined from the slopes and
intercepts, respectively, of the van’ Hoff plot (lnKL versus 1/T). The
calculated thermodynamicparameters are given in Table 3. Because
all G◦ values are negative, the adsorption of MB onto PLP is a
spontaneousprocess, conﬁrming theafﬁnityofPLP for thedye.Gen-
erally, a valueofG◦ inbetween0and−20kJ/mol is consistentwith
electrostatic interaction between adsorption sites and the adsorb-
ing ion (physical adsorption) while a more negative G◦ value
ranging from −80 to −400kJ/mol indicates that the adsorption
involves charge sharing or transferring from the adsorbent surface
to the adsorbing ion to form a coordinate bond (chemisorption)
[39–41]. As shown, themagnitude ofG◦ (−24.76 to−28.19kJ/mol)
for this adsorption system is a slightly above the physical adsorp-
tion range but signiﬁcantly below the chemisorption range. These
values suggest that the adsorption is a typical physical process
enhanced by the chemical effect. The small negative value of H◦
(−5.93kJ/mol) indicates that the adsorption is physical in nature
involvingweak attractive forces and is exothermic. This implies that
the adsorption process is energetically stable. The low value of H◦
also implies loose bonding between the MB molecules and the PLP
surface [41]. The positive value of S◦ (76.4 J/(Kmol)) indicates an
increase in the degree of freedom (or disorder) of the adsorbed
species. In general, the thermodynamic parameters indicate that
the adsorption is spontaneous and exothermic.
4. Conclusions
Present studies showed that the adsorption of MB onto
PLP is favored at high pH, lower temperature, and low ionic
strength. The adsorption kinetics followed a pseudo-second-
order kinetic model and intra-particle diffusion was involved
in the adsorption process. Fitting of Langmuir isotherm data
showed that the maximum adsorption capacity increases with
increasing pH and decreasing temperature. PLP has a maxi-
mum adsorption capacity of 8.88×10−4 mol/g at pH 7.5 and
24 ◦C, which is much higher than many low-cost adsorbents.
Thermodynamic parameters suggest that the adsorption is a typ-
ical physical process, spontaneous, and exothermic in nature.
This study revealed that the PLP can be used as an econom-
ical natural-based adsorbent to remove MB dye from aqueous
solution. When the PLP used as adsorbent becomes saturated,
it can be incinerated. Since the production of pineapple occurs
year-round in most tropical countries, wasted pineapple leaves
can easily be acquired and used for future commercial applica-
tions.

ABSTRACT 
 
The present study investigates the adsorption characteristics of Cu(II) onto a 
low-cost biosorbent, pineapple leaf powder. Various pretreatments of pineapple leaf 
powder (PLP) were compared for their Cu removal efficiency. PLP treated with 0.1 M 
NaOH achieved the highest Cu removal due to excess amount of hydroxyl group 
grafted onto PLP. Batch adsorption experiments showed that PLP could effectively 
remove Cu(II) from aqueous solution. Functional groups of PLP responsible to bind 
the Cu2+ were identified. Results showed that the uptake of Cu2+ by PLP was very 
rapid, and 90% of Cu could be removed within the first 20 minutes. The kinetic 
experimental data could be described by a pseudo 2nd order equation. The adsorption 
is influenced by pH, ionic strength, surface loading, and temperature. Based on the 
values of activation energy, it is suggested that the adsorption was controlled by the 
process of diffusion and a chemisorption mechanism. The adsorption increased with 
temperature, suggesting an endothermic reaction. The maximum adsorption capacities 
calculated from Langmuir isotherms is 9.28 mg/g at pH 5.0. From the perspective of 
waste utilization, high copper adsorption capacity and freely abundant availability of 
this low-cost adsorbent, PLP is potentially useful for future practical applications.

1. INTRODUCTION  
 Waste effluents from industries such as electroplating, metal finishing, battery 
recovery and manufacturing usually contain appreciable amounts of heavy metals 
causing adverse effects on aquatic and human life if they are not treated properly. The 
most common technique adopted in treating these metallic wastewaters is chemical 
precipitation/coagulation. The drawbacks of this technique are consumption of 
chemicals and the generation of metal sludge. The effluent treated by this technique 
may not meet the stringent discharge standard. Membrane separation is a promising 
method to separate metal ions from effluent; however, the high cost of this method

from Cu(NO3)2·3H2O) purchased from J. T. Baker. Mature pineapple leaves used for 
biosorption experiments were obtained from a tract of farmland near the campus of 
I-Shou University, Kaoshiung. The leaves are sword-shaped about 75–90 cm in length 
and 5–7 cm in width. Upon collection, each leaf was first washed with tap water two 
or three times to remove dust and impurities. The leaves were then air-dried and 
subsequently oven dried at 80◦C for 24 hours. The dried raw leaves were treated 
under a high pressure of 70 kPa at 100oC for 20 min using a pressure cooker. This 
pretreatment process was repeated several times until the supernatant was free of 
color. The oven-dried (100 ± 5oC for 1 day) steamed pineapple leaves were then 
pulverized by a grinder equipped with a rotating cutter blade, and then passed through 
a 100 ASTM sieve. The milled leaf wastes particles finer than 0.149 mm were used as 
adsorbent. In order to find out a best pretreatment method for copper adsorption, the 
milled leaf powder was then received one of pos-treatments, including base washing 
(0.1 M NaOH), acid washing (0.1 M HNO3), and formaldehyde washing (10%. 
Details of these post treatments and denotation of the adsorbents are listed in Table 1. 
Fresh powder activated carbon (PAC) obtained from a local industrial wastewater 
plant was used as a benchmark adsorbent for comparison of copper removal. 
  A scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Hitachi S2700) with an electron 
acceleration voltage of 20 kV was used to observe the surface physical morphology of 
the leaf particles. To identify the major functional groups participating in Cu binding 
on leaf powders, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was conducted using 
a FTIR spectrophotometer (Bruker Vector 22) with an absorption spectrum between 
400 and 1600 cm-1. The FTIR spectra of the leaf powder was analyzed and compared 
before and after loading with Cu solution. The specific surface area and pore volume 
of leaf powder were determined with a Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) N2 surface 
area analyzer (Beckman Coulter SA3100). The pHzpc (pH at zero point of charge) of 
the leaf powder was determined with a zetameter (Lazer ZeeR model 500, Pen Kem 
Inc.). The pH of each leaf powder samples was measured in water suspension at a 1:1 
weight ratio of the adsorbent to distilled water using a pH meter.

The SEM images, in general, show heterogeneous tiny pores on the roughness

the stem of the leaves. As shown, the pore structure of PLP becomes clear after post 
treatments. In particular, the alkalization treatment has rendered the pineapple leaf 
more porous than the one treated only with stream washing. The pore volume of PLP 
and BPLP is 0.033 and 0.106 mL/g, respectively. It is likely that the rate of adsorption

PLP (4.39×10-5) ≧ FPLP (4.35×10-5) > APLP (3.90×10-5) >> PAC (1.43×10-5). 
 
3.3. Effect of Contacting Time 
 In order to obtain the time required to achieve equilibrium, the experiments were 
conducted at different Cu to PLP ratios (surface loading). Figure 4 shows the extent of 
Cu2+ adsorption affected by contacting time and the loading concentration for initial 
Cu2+ ranging from 1×10-5 to 4×10-5 M and ionic strength of 1×10-2 M. As shown, the 
uptake of Cu2+ by PLP was very rapid within the first 20 minutes. The uptake of Cu 
progressively decreased with time thereafter. Equilibrium was established at 60 
minutes for this concentration range. In viewing these kinetic data, two phases were 
observed: (a) the first rapid adsorption phase and (b) the second phase, where a 
progressive adsorption reaching equilibrium and remaining constant thereafter. The 
first stage can be attributed to the rapid attachment of Cu ions to the surface activate 
sites of the PLP by surface mass transfer. The second part of slow adsorption is 
normally considered as being influenced by diffusion into the pores of an adsorbent. 
In the fast adsorption stage, around 90% Cu removal was achieved in all cases. The 
practical significance of this fast removal phenomenon is that it can facilitate the 
adsorption process by shortening the operating period. The subsequent slow 
adsorption phase occurred is mainly because the readily available active sites were 
already occupied by Cu and the slower diffusion of the solute into the interior pore 
spaces of leaf powders.

the stronger the driving forces of the concentration gradient exhibit, thus promoting 
the increase in the initial adsorption rate. On the contrary, the apparent adsorption rate 
constant, was inverse proportional to the initial Cu concentration as initial Cu 
concentration or surface loading raised from 1×10-5 to 4×10-5 M. Higher surface 
loadings would result in less diffusion efficiency and a high competition of Cu ions 
for a fixed surface adsorbing site, consequently, a lower k2 value was observed. Such 
phenomenon generally involved adsorbate-adsorbate competition for adsorption sites 
at higher surface loadings that changes sorbent affinity due to an adjustment of 
bonding.

3.5. Effect of ionic strength 
 Metallic wastewater, particularly from metal surface industry, often contains 
excess levels of soluble salts. Research on how the influence of ionic strength on the 
adsorption was a necessary part of this study. In the present work, adsorption kinetic 
affected by ionic strength was carried out with a series of experiments at different 
NaClO4 concentrations ranging from 2.5×10-3 M to 5×10-2 M. As shown in Fig. 5, the 
amount of Cu ions adsorbed decreased as increasing NaClO4 loading strength. The 
PSO model fit constants (Table 4) show that an increase in ionic strength led to a 
decrease in both apparent adsorption rate and initial rate. Ionic strength is an 
important parameter affecting the electrical double layer (EDL) structure of a 
hydrated particulate. The thickness of EDL (m), 1/κ (m-1), can be determined from the 
relationship:

3.6. Effect of temperature 
 Fig. 7 shows the adsorption kinetics affected by temperature (11–41oC). It is 
evident that the magnitude of Cu adsorption is proportional to the solution 
temperature. Results PSO fitting showed that the kinetic data at this temperature rage 
were well represented by the PSO model based on the high correlation coefficients 
(i.e., r2 > 0.987) with low s values. It is evident that the adsorption rate is greatly 
affected by the temperature. The apparent rate, k2, increased from 3.15×103 to 
5.69×103 g/mol-min when temperature increased from 11 to 41oC, indicating that the 
adsorption process is faster and more favorable at higher temperatures. The value of 
v0 increases from 4.10×10-6 to 1.19×10-5 mol/g-min, showing the temperature was able 
to promote the initial rate of adsorption. The adsorption increased with temperature, 
suggesting an endothermic reaction. An increase in temperature can hasten the driving 
force of diffusion across the external boundary layer and increase the rate of diffusion 
within the pores. Consequently, Cu ion more easily enters the interior pore of leaf 
powder. 
 The apparent rate constants, k2, were expressed as a function of temperature by 
the Arrhenius relationship and were used to estimate the activation energy (Ea) of the 
adsorption process.

where A is the pre-exponential factor, R is the universal gas constant (1.987 cal/mol K) 
and T is the absolute temperature (K). From the plot of ln k2 versus 1/T (Fig. 8), the 
pre-exponential factor, A, was calculated to be 14.0, which suggested that the rate of 
adsorption would increase at a higher temperature. The slope is equal to −Ea/R from 
which the apparent activation energy of the adsorption process was determined to be 
6.99 kJ/mol. The magnitude of Ea explains the type of adsorption, i.e., physical or 
chemical mechanism. Because the bonding forces involved in physical adsorption are 
weak, normally the Ea value for physical adsorption is less than 4.0 kJ/mol. The Ea 
value for chemical adsorption is usually higher than 4–6 kJ/mol (Baysal et al. 2009) 
while a diffusion-controlled process has an activation energy less than 25–30 kJ/mol 
(Ho and McKay 1998). The slightly higher Ea value obtained in this study suggested 
that the adsorption of Cu2+ onto PLP was a diffusion-controlled process and the 
action involved in chemisorption mechanism. re

clay minerals, such as red mud (5.34 mg/g) and kaolinite (4.3 mg/g), activated carbon 
(3.56 mg/g) (Machida et al. 2005), and other biomass substances (potato peels and 
modified oak sawdust). Although activated carbon cloth (Huang and Su 2010) and 
carbon nanotubes (Li et al. 2010) have remarkable Cu adsorption capacity, the high 
cost of these adsorbents will clearly limit its use in wastewater treatment. The 
pineapple leaf exhibits high Cu adsorption capacity and it can be obtained cheaply in 
large quantity. Thus, it has high potential to be used as an economical viable 
adsorbent for Cu removal from wastewaters. 
 
4. CONCLUSIONS 
 In summary, pineapple leaf powder (PLP) treated with a base solution exhibited 
a superior Cu(II) adsorption capability. A rapid Cu adsorption with more than 90% 
removal was achieved within 20 minutes of contact time. The kinetic data fit well to 
the pseudo second order equation. Based on the values of activation energy, it is 
suggested that the adsorption process is governed by diffusion and the reaction 
involved in chemisorption mechanism. Copper adsorption was highly dependent on 
solution pH and the removal efficiency was higher in alkaline range and low ionic 
strength. Equilibrium data were correlated well with the Langmuir isotherm model 
and a maximum Cu adsorption capacity of 9.28 mg/g was determined. Analysis of 
FTIR showed that the main functional groups of pineapple leaves participating in Cu 
binding were –OH, –CH and –C–O groups. Findings reveal that pineapple leaf 
powder, an abundantly available waste, is an economically viable adsorbent for the 
effective removal of Cu from aqueous solutions. Because pineapple leaf can easily be 
acquired its uses should be encouraged for practical applications.

for the removal of dyes from colored textile wastewater. Because of its high adsorption 
capacity, activated carbon has long been extensively used as a landmark adsorbent in 
wastewater treatment for contaminant separation. However, high operation cost has limited its 
use (especially for some undeveloped countries) in a wastewater treatment plant. The use of 
low-cost adsorbent as an alternative to activated carbon has received much attention by many 
researchers. The main advantage of using low-cost adsorbent is that regeneration is not 
necessary after saturation whereas regeneration of activated carbon is essential. Regeneration 
can be a complex and costly recovery process, which may result in additional effluent and 
potentially, the adsorbent would suffer a considerable loss of its adsorbing capacity. In recent 
years, tea waste has increasingly gained interest as a cost-effective adsorbent to remove 
various contaminants from aqueous solution, such as Cu, Pb9, basic dye10, and Zn11. Tea 
leaves largely consist of insoluble cell walls such as lignin, condensed tannins, cellulose and 
hemicelluloses, and structural proteins. The tea leaves have a good potential as pollutant 
scavengers from aqueous solutions because of they contain certain functional groups that will 
tie up the pollutants. The main functional groups in lignin, tannin and phenolic compounds 
contribute to contaminant removal including carboxylate, aromatic carboxylate, phenolic 
hydroxyl and oxyl groups.11 In the literature, the use of tea waste as an adsorbent to treat 
colored textile wastewater is scarce. In this study, batch adsorption experiments were carried 
out to evaluate the effectiveness of using green and black tea wastes as adsorbent for 
decoloration of textile effluent.  
 
Experimental Methods 
 
Tea waste 
The adsorbents, including green tea waste (without fermentation) and black tea waste (full 
fermentation) were collected from a local tea manufacturing company. To remove residual tea 
color (tannins) and impurities, the raw tea wastes were treated under a high pressure of 70 kPa 
at 100oC for 20 min using a pressured cooker. This pretreatment process is repeated until the 
supernatant is free of color. The natural air-dried tea wastes were then pulverized by a grinder 
equipped with a rotating cutter blade, and then passed through a 100 ASTM sieve. The milled 
tea wastes particles finer than 0.149 mm were used as adsorbent. The green tea powder (GTP), 
steamed green tea powder (SGTP), black tea powder (BTP), and steamed back tea powder 
(SBTP) were used in this study. Fresh powder activated carbon (PAC) obtained from a local 
industrial wastewater plant was used as a landmark adsorbent for comparison of color 
removal.  
 
Morphology of the tea wastes particles were characterized using a scanning electron 
microscope (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (Hitachi 
S2700). An electron acceleration voltage of 20 kV was applied to the gold-plated sample for 
SEM observation and EDS analysis. To identify the major functional groups participating in 
dye binding on tea wastes, studies of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were 
conducted on a FTIR pectrophotometer (Bruker Vector 22) with the absorption spectrum 
between 400 and 4,000 cm-1. The FTIR analysis in solid phase was conduced and the spectra 
of the tea wastes were analyzed and compared before and after loading with textile 
wastewater. The specific surface area and pore volume of tea wastes were determined with a 
Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) N2 surface area analyzer (Beckman Coulter SA3100). The 
zeta potential of hydrolyzed tea wastes were determined instrumentally using a zeta meter 
(Laser Zee 3.0, Pen Kem Inc., Bedford Hills, NY).   
 
 
Results and Discussion 
 
Adsorbent characterization  
Table 2 outlines some characteristic properties of the adsorbents used. The results of zeta 
potential measurements show that the pHzpc of tea wastes is low (2.6-2.8). Therefore, at a 
solution pH less than the pHzpc, the tea waste particles possess a positively charged surface, 
which is favorable for adsorbing anionic MB. Most of the dyes used in this company are 
belong to the category of anionic type. It can be seen that the PAC have pHzpc of 5.2 and 
relatively high surface area (744.6 m2/g) and pore volume (0.403 mL/g) than those of tea 
wastes.

On both SGTP and GTP, several identical peaks have been observed. In general, the 
pretreatment process did not change the spectra of these peaks. These functional groups are 
described as follows. The peaks that appear at 2925 and 2359 cm-1 on both adsorbents are 
corresponding to the C–H groups of aliphatic acids and the amine –NH group, respectively. 
The peaks observed near 1530 cm-1 represent the secondary amine group, whereas the band 
near 1371 cm-1 is attributed to symmetric bending of CH3. The strong C–O band observed at 
1060-1062 cm-1 is an indication of the lignin structure12 of the tea leaf waste. Overall, FTIR 
analysis revealed that the chemical nature of the cellulosic material (green tea waste) did not 
change much upon pressure steam pretreatment. Similar types of functional groups, such 
as –OH, amine (–NH), and C-O, have been reported by Uddin et al13.

Changes of solution pH affect the degree of ionization of the dyes and the surface charge of 
adsorbent. The pH-dependence of adsorptive process is associated with the dissociation of 
functional groups on the surface active sites of adsorbents. Comparing the performance of all 
adsorbents studied, the most cost-effective adsorbent shown in this study is green tea waste. 
The superior color adsorption capacity of GTP/SGTP is attributed to the existence of 
polyphenolic catechins. Unlike black tea, green tea is unfermented; the oxidation of 
polyphenolic catechins is minimal. Graham14 reported that around 30 to 40% catechins could 
be extracted from dried green tea, whereas black tea contains only 4% of catechins. Green tea 
extract contains four main polyphenols: epicatechin (EC), epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), 
epigallocatechin (EGC), and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG).15 The four polyphenols are 
believed to be responsible for green tea's amazing color removal capability. In summary, the 
PAC proves to be useful over a wilder pH range for color removal, whereas green tea waste 
offers a superior decoloration under acidic condition. The black tea waste did not achieve a 
satisfactory color removal due to the loss of –OH functional group during the full 
fermentation process. 
 
Adsorption kinetics 
Figure 5 presents the extent of color adsorption by various adsorbents affected by contacting 
time. It is clear that the amount of color adsorbed is minimal for both BTP and SBTP when 
compared with PAC, GTP, and SGTP. GTP that was found to have the largest adsorption 
capacity. One kinetic feature of color removal indicates the amount of color adsorbed 
progressively increased with time and then followed by reaching an equilibrium state. 
Equilibrium was achieved in 24 hours. Two stages of these kinetic curves were observed: (1) 
the first stage, where a fast adsorption happened within 4 hours and (2) the second stage, 
where a progressive adsorption occurred thereafter. In the fast adsorption stage, around 60% 
of color was removed in all cases. The stage of progressively reaching equilibrium is due to 
most of the external available active sites were already occupied, and then the slow diffusion 
of dye molecules into the pore spaces of the adsorbent.

various adsorbents. The linear plots with a high r2 value (> 0.99) show the applicability of 
IPD model for the adsorption process. Two distinguishable intercepting lines are observed in 
these plots, implying that the adsorption was governed by a multi-step process. The first 
intercepting line happens within 4 hours, which is indicative of the IPD process while the 
second intercepting line represents the solution was progressively reaching equilibrium 
adsorption after 4 hours. The slope of the first linear portion gives the intra-particle rate 
constant, ki, while the intercept of this portion is proportional to the thickness of boundary, Cb. 
The values of ki and Cb are given in Figure 6. The results show that the values of intercept Cb 
(ADMI/g) have the order of GTP (196.3) > PAC (111.9) > SGTP (67.5). This indicates that a 
stronger boundary layer effect in the adsorption process happen in the GTP system. The value 
of Cb also provides a measure of the abundance of solute adsorbed on the boundary layer. The 
order sequence of Cb coincides with the amount of color adsorbed as shown in Figure 5. The 
resulting values of ki are related to the rate of diffusion. Since PAC exhibits a higher pore 
volume value (0.403 mL/g) than that of SGTP (0.126 mL/g) and GTP (0.113 mL/g), the 
values of ki (ADMI/hr0.5-g) are in the order of PAC (64.5) > SGTP (59.1) > GTP (53.1). In 
general, the linearity of these plots confirms that the adsorption of color onto tea wastes and 
PAC is a multi-step process, involving adsorption on the external surface and IPD into the 
interior of the pore. The rate of adsorption is limited by the pore diffusion.

Effect of adsorbent dosage 
Fig. 7 presents the effect of adsorbent dosage on the removal of color using PAC, GTP, and 
SGTP. Since the removal efficiency of BTP and SBTP is low, the results were not presented 
in this graph. As shown in Fig. 7, the percentage removal of color increased with the increase 
in adsorbent dosage. This phenomenon is attributed to increased availability of adsorption 
sites resulting from an increase of adsorbent dosage. Fig. 7 also shows the residual color 
decreased with increased adsorbent dosage. As shown, 0.8 g/L is a minimum adsorbent 
dosage to achieve discharge effluent criteria of 550 ADMI. However, in order to assure the 
color removal to minimize the adverse impacts on aquatic life, an adsorbent dosage higher 
 
Adsorption isotherms 
Two well-known isotherms were adopted to model the equilibrium adsorption data shown in 
Figure 7: 
(1). Freundlich isotherm model:19 
q = KF Ce1/n                        (4) 
where Ce is equilibrium residual color (ADMI); KF (1/g) and n are Freundlich constants. 
(2). Langmuir isotherm model:20 
q = KLQmCe/(1+ KLCe)            (5) 
where q is amounts of color adsorbed, in terms of ADMI, at equilibrium (ADMI/g); KL is the 
Langmuir adsorption constant (1/ADMI); and Qm is the maximum color adsorption capacity 
(ADMI/g). Because the noticeably less color removal capacity of black tea waste than that of 
green tea waste, only GTP and SGTP were presented in the isotherm analysis. Table 5 lists the 
calculated constants for Freundlich and Langmuir models. It is evident from the correlation 
coefficient that the equilibrium data were better represented by the Langmuir isotherm than 
the Freundlich model. An exceptional adsorption capacity of 901 ADMI/g was determined, 
which is much higher than the PAC of only 542 ADMI/g in spite of the fact that the PAC has 
a remarkable higher specific surface area. However, the values of the adsorption affinity 
constants (KL) for the green tea waste are much less than the PAC. This observation can be 
verified by the changes of Freundlich adsorption constants shown in Table 5. The values of n 
are all greater than one, indicating favorable adsorption. In summary, isotherms fitting show 
that the color adsorption performance favors the STGP because it has a higher adsorption 
capacity and cheaper operation costs than the PAC.

SUMMARY 
 
The effectiveness of black tea and green tea wastes were examined by batch adsorption 
experiments for their decoloration of colored textile wastewater. Our findings reveal that pH 
is a key parameter affecting the color removal. Although powder activated carbon works over 
a wilder pH range for color removal, a remarkable color removal occurred for the steam 
treated green tea powder (SGTP) under acidic pH, which proved to be a 90% ADMI removal 
rate for raw wastewater with a color strength of 1106 ADMI. The black tea waste did not 
achieve a promising color removal due to the loss of –OH functional group during the full 
fermentation process of the tea. Based on FTIR analysis, the functional groups responsible for 
the color removal by SGTP/GTP were –OH, –NH, C=O stretching, and C–O. Fitting of an

ABSTRACT 
 
Waste effluents from textile industry contain recalcitrant toxic dyestuffs. Most of them are 
non-biodegradable exhibiting adverse effects on aquatic life and are also hazardous to humans. 
Effective treatment technologies of dye wastes are needed to achieve the highly tightening 
effluent standard. Adsorption method has been considered a promising alternative among 
many dye removal techniques because it is capable of removing a variety of coloring 
dyestuffs. In this study, the use of tea waste to decolorize refractory dyestuff from textile 
wastewater was investigated. The changes of pH and contacting time affecting adsorption 
were examined in various adsorbents, namely green tea-leaf powder (GTP), black tea-leaf 
powder (BTP), powder activated carbon (PAC). Results of batch experiments revealed that 
the removal efficiency of American Dye Manufacturers Institute (ADMI) increases with 
decreasing pH. The value of ADMI reduced from 1106 to 150 with 0.8 g/L of GTP at pH 2. 
Results also showed that the order of ADMI removal efficiency is GTP > PAC >> BTP. 
Analysis of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that the active functional groups 
involved in the adsorptive decoloration of tea waste were hydroxyl, amine, carboxyl 
stretching, and C–O groups. Due to the lack of polyphenols during the tea fermentation and 
manufacturing process, BTP exhibited a less ADMI removed efficiency than that of GTP. 
Work carried out has revealed that green tea waste has a high potential to be used as an 
economical viable adsorbent for decolorzation of textile effluents.  
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Waste effluents released from textile industry contain recalcitrant toxic dyestuffs with a high 
color strength causing adverse effects on aquatic and human life. Because most dyes used in 
the textile industry are non-biodegradable and toxic refractory, treatment of dye waste effluent 
using conventional activated sludge coupled with coagulation method is no longer to be 
considered a promising decoloration process. Effective treatment technologies of dye wastes 
must be found to meet the tightening effluent standard so as to minimize such undesired 
effects. Many advanced oxidation technologies have been developed to overcome the 
difficulties of treating colored textile wastes. These technologies include: gamma irradiation1, 
electro-coagulation2, Fenton oxidation3,4, ultrasonic degradation5, electro-Fenton and 
photo-Fenton process6, Fenton and ultrasound irradiation7, as well as ozonation8. The 
advantages and successful of treating dye waste with these AOP methods are evident. 
However, electricity consumption, possible toxic derivatives, chemical dosage, and 
optimization of controlling factors often create serious concerns of adopting AOP process 
when treating massive discharge.    
 
With the selection of a proper adsorbent, the adsorption process can be a preferred technique 
Color analysis 
American Dye Manufactures Institute (ADMI) Tristimulus Filter Method (3 wavelength 
method, 3WL) (APHA, 1998) is the standard analytical method used for true color 
measurements of wastewater sample. The ADMI color value provides a true measure of water 
color (Kao et al. 2001). Since 1998, the Taiwan EPA (Environmental Protection 
Administration) has been using the 3WL method for the true color value measurement of 
colored wastewater (coded NIEA W223.51B). Currently Taiwan regulations limit wastewater 
discharge for the textile industry to 550 ADMI.  
 
Textile wastewater  
Colored raw wastewater was taken from a textile manufacturing company in southern Taiwan 
before it flowed into the treatment plant. Reactive and disperse dyes are the main dye types 
used in the manufacturing process of this textile company. The conventional treatment process 
(coagulation and biological activated sludge) allows this company to treat 6000~8000 M3/day 
of colored wastewater. Table 1 summarizes the water quality of raw wastewater and effluent 
from this treatment plant. Although the effluent does meet the regulated criteria of Taiwan 
EPA, the discharged effluent still contains an observable color of 242 ADMI. Concentration of 
heavy metal in raw wastewater (Cu, Cd, Zn, Ni, Pb, and Cr) is low, indicating the 
metal-complex dyes were not used in the dying process of this company.

Adsorption experiments  
Batch adsorption experiments were carried out by preparing a series of 100-mL raw 
wastewater containing a fixed amount of adsorbent. After adjusting the initial pH value to 
2.0-9.0 with either 0.1 M HNO3 or 0.01 M NaOH solutions, the mixtures were shaken on a 
reciprocal shaker at 150 excursions/min for 24 hr. Experiments were carried out under 
isothermal conditions at 26°C by placing the mixtures in a shaker equipped with a water 
circulation bath. After shaking, a portion of the sample was taken and immediately filtered 
through the 0.45 μm glass fiber filter to collect the supernatant. The residual true color in the 
supernatant was analyzed using a spectrophotometer (HACH DR/2010, USA). The 
experimental procedure employed for studying the effect of time on the color removal was the 
same as that described above except different contacting time intervals. Each run of the 
experiment was replicated and the average values were used in the data analysis. Blank tests 
without adsorbent were run in parallel to correct possible adsorption on the reactor and the 
filter apparatus. 
Scanning Electron Micrograph (SEM) 
SEM was employed to observe the surface physical morphology of adsorbents, namely BTP, 
GBTP, GTP, and SGTP. The SEM images exhibit heterogeneous small pores between the 
roughness and irregular layer structure of tea leaves (Figure 1). The irregular layer structures 
are believed to be cellulose and the stem of the tea leaves. The pores can trap the dye 
molecules. It is likely that the rate of adsorption would be limited by transporting dyes into 
the interior pores of activated adsorbing sites of these adsorbents. The EDS analysis of GTP 
and SGTP before and after adsorption was presented in Figure 2. The results (Figure 2a, b and 
Table 3) reveal that the major constituents of the biosorbent are C and O and the minor 
portion is Ca. It is evident that two extra peaks, Na and S, appear in the EDS spectrum after 
loading with dyes, which is an indication of the binding of dyes onto tea wastes.

FTIR Analysis 
Figure 3a shows the FTIR spectroscopic characteristics of raw GTP and SGTP. A number of 
adsorption peaks were identified, depicting the complex nature of the tea waste. On SGTP and 
GTP, the broad strong brands at 3383.6 and 3356.8 cm-1, respectively, is indicative of the 
existence of surface hydroxyl (–OH) groups. The peaks at 1654.1 and 1647.8 cm-1 on SGTP 
and GTP, respectively, can be attributed to carboxyl (C=O) stretching which may be 
corresponding to the lignin aromatic C–C bond. It is clear that the pretreatment (pressure 
steam) process has caused a shift of the above intense bands.   
When SGTP and GTP were loaded with dyes (Figure 3b), the shift of spectra after adsorption 
include bonded –OH groups (shifts from 3383.6 to 3393.4 cm-1 for SGTP, and shifts largely 
from 3356.8 to 3406.8 cm-1 for GTP), –NH group (shifts at around 2330 to 2359 cm-1 for both 
SGTP and GTP), C=O stretching (shifts slightly from 1654.1 to 1651.6 cm-1 for SGTP, and 
shifts from 1647.8 to 1652.4 cm-1 for GTP), and the C–O- group (shifts from 1062 to 1051.9 
cm-1 for SGTP, and shifts from 1060.7 to 1036.8 cm-1 for GTP). Thus, it is suggested that 
these functional groups, that shift prominently, are likely to participate in dye binding. It 
should be noted that, when both SGTP and GTP are loaded with dyes, an intense sharp peak at 
1384.4 cm-1 (Figure 3b) was observed, which is due to the absorption of colored materials that 
originated from the textile wastewater. Results of FTIR also indicated that the chemical nature 
of these cellulosic bioadsorbents was relatively unchanged after the pretreatment process and 
dye adsorption.   
 
Effect of pH on color biosorption 
Solution pH is an important parameter affecting decoloration of tea wastes. The dependence 
of the adsorption affected by pH was conducted by varying the initial pH for raw wastewater 
(1106 ADMI) and an adsorbate concentration of 0.8 g/L at 26°C. Figure 4 shows the residual 
color of textile wastewater effluent after treating with 5 different adsorbents, namely SGTP, 
GTP, SBTP, BTP, and PAC. It is clear that acidic conditions are favorable for color removal 
for all of these adsorbents. For the BTP and SBTP, in fact, the color removal efficiency was 
only 10-15% at equilibrium pH below 3.0, and negligible removal occurred above pH 4.0. 
When the GTP and SGTP were used, the resulting color removal efficiency increased to 
75-85%. The color removal became insignificant at pH levels higher than 6.0 for all tea 
wastes. On the other hand, the adsorption of PAC exhibited a different characteristic from tea 
waste in this regard. Although the PAC is effective in color removal at wider pH range studied; 
nevertheless, GTP and SGTP are more effective at low pH region. To meet the discharge 
standard (< 550 ADMI), it is important to adjust the pH to acidic condition. Our results also 
show that both GTP and STP yield a better result than that of PAC under pH < 3.0.

It is evident that pH is a key parameter affecting the color removal from aqueous solution. 
An empirical kinetic model namely modified Freundlich equations (MFE)16, was used to 
analyze the kinetic adsorption data: 
qt = kCot1/m                                                  (1) 
where qt is amounts of color adsorbed (ADMI/g) at time t (hr); Co is the original color (ADMI) 
in the wastewater; t is the contact time (hr); k is the apparent rate constant (1/g-min); m is the 
constant. To verify the validity of MFE in describing the kinetic color removal data, the 
least-squares correlation coefficient (r2) and normalize standard deviation s (%) were 
calculated for each experiment. The s is expressed as: 
1n
]qq[
100s
2
cal,texp,t
−
−∑×=                                        (2) 
where qt,exp and qt,cal are the measured and calculated color adsorbed at time t, respectively, 
and n is the number of data points.  
 
Figure 5 displays the fittings of MFE to the experimental data. Table 4 summarizes the 
residual color after treating with different adsorbents and the corresponding fitting parameters 
of this model. As seen in Table 4, the high correlation coefficients (r2) with low standard 
deviations (s) indicate that the experimental data can be fitted to the MFE model. As seen in 
Table 4, the order of adsorption rate is GTP > PAC > SGTP >> BTP/SBTP. In particular, the 
rate of GTP/SGTP is much higher than that of BTP/SBTP, indicating that the adsorption 
process is faster and more favorable for GTP/SGTP. Results clearly indicated that both GTP 
and SGTP could effectively remove color from textile wastewater, whereas BTP and SBTP 
had only low removal rates.

Intra-particle diffusion equation (IPD) 
Due to the porous nature of the adsorbents, it is hypothesized that the adsorption of dyes onto 
tea waste and powder activated carbon is a multiple-step process involving transport of dyes 
from bulk solution to the surface of the adsorbent, and then followed by diffusion into the 
interior of the adsorbents' pores. An intra-particle diffusion model original developed by 
Weber Jr. and Morris17 was used to analysis the kinetic data, which is expressed as follows. 
 
qt = kit1/2＋Cb                  (3) 
 
where kp is the IPD rate constant (mol/min1/2-g) and value of Cb gives the concept of the 
thickness of the boundary layer, i.e., the larger the intercept, the greater the boundary layer 
effect.18  
 
Based on the above experimental data and analysis, GTP, SGTP, and PAC were selected for 
fitting IPD model because of their large adsorption capacity. Figure 6 shows the IPD plots for 
than 2 g/L deemed necessary. Below an adsorbent dosage of 1.5 g/L, once could not 
differentiate the color removal performance of the three adsorbents. At adsorbent dosage 
levels higher than 1.5 g/L, the order of color removal efficiency of these adsorbents is PAC > 
SGTP > GTP. At dosage levels higher than 2 g/L, the removal efficiency of GTP decreased 
due to release of tannin color from the GTP. The tannin color contributes to the increase of 
residual color, thus less color removal was observed. The cleaning process, (pressure steam 
treatment), had rendered less tannin leached, which resulted in a higher adsorption capacity. 
At adsorbent dosages higher than 2.4 g/L, up to 90 and 96% color removal was achieved for 
SGTP and PAC, respectively, while the removal was only 70% for GTP.

Effluent standard
Adsorbent (g/L)  
 
Figure 8 shows the comparison of color from raw wastewater, residual color of the 
supernatant after being treated by SGTP, and effluent from conventional wastewater treatment 
plant. As seen from this figure, at an adsorbent dosage higher than 2.4 g/L, the residual color 
decreased drastically from 886 ADMI to 114 ADMI, which is lower than the regulated 
effluent standard (550 ADMI). Any addition of adsorbent would not further decrease the 
residual color. When the same wastewater treated by activated sludge and coagulation process, 
an effluent color of 242 ADMI was observed. It is evident that removal of colored textile 
wastewater using SGTP adsorption is superior to that of the conventional wastewater 
treatment process. In summary, the use of green tea waste to treat colored textile wastewater is 
promising and cost-effective.

wastewater) , (2) 2.4 g SGTP, (3) 2.8 g/L SGTP, (4) 3.2 g/L SGTP, (5) coagulation + activated 
sludge process (effluent from the wastewater treatment plant).

empirical kinetic model, namely modified Freundlich equation, indicated that the color 
removal is faster and more favorable for GTP/SGTP than BTP/SBTP. The linearity of IPD 
plots confirmed the adsorption of color onto tea waste and PAC followed a multi-step process, 
however the rate of adsorption was limited by the pore diffusion. Results showed that the 
percentage of color removal increased with the increase in adsorbent dosage. A reverse color 
removal was observed when there was no pretreatment of GTP at a high adsorbent dosage, 
which is attributed to the release of tannin color from the GTP. By applying an adsorbent 
dosage of 2.4 g/L to a color strength of 886 ADMI textile wastewater, up to 90% and 96% 
color removal was achieved for SGTP and PAC, respectively, while the removal was only 
70% for GTP. When the same wastewater treated by activated sludge and coagulation process, 
the color removal was only 71%. Models showed that the equilibrium isotherm data are better 
described by Langmuir equation than that of Freundlich equation. The maximum adsorption 
capacities for SGAC and GAC are 901 and 892 ADMI/g, respectively, which is superior to 
that of PAC (542 ADMI/g). Additional findings reveal that green tea waste is an economically 
viable adsorbent with superb color removal capability from textile wastewater. The superb 
adsorption capacity of green tea water will pave the way for the future application of this 
abundant available adsorbent to treat colored textile effluents.
