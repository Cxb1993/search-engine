particle bounce from the uncoated impaction substrate 
was investigated. Results showed that particle bounce 
did not influence the overall mass distribution of 
ambient fine particles when RH ranged between 40 to 
80 % while it severely under-sampled particles 
greater than 2.5  m in aerodynamic diameter. 
Oversampling of PM0.1 by as much as 95-180 % or 25-50 
% occurred when the MOUDI used uncoated ALs or TFs, 
respectively, as RH was reduced from 50 to 25%. 
Particle bounce was reduced substantially and PM0.1 
was found to be sampled accurately with less than 5 % 
of error by the MOUDIs with uncoated ALs and TFs at 
the RH > 75 and 65 %, respectively.  
In addition to particle bounce, the other practical 
problem is nozzle clogging. To resolve this problem, 
the NCTU micro-orifice cascade impactor (NMCI) was 
developed. In the NMCI, new nozzle plates with smooth 
nozzle shape made by the LIGA (Lithography, 
Electroplating, and Molding) process were used to 
replace the 7th to 10th stages in one of the MOUDI. 
To evaluate the sampling performance of the NMCI, the 
NMCI and the MOUDI were tested for the particle 
collection efficiency curves and interstage loss of 
nanoparticles. Test results show that after adjusting 
proper S/W ratios (S: jet to plate distance, W: 
nozzle diameter), the cutoff aerodynamic diameters 
(dpa50) are close to the nominal values given in 
Marple et al. (1991). Total interstage loss of 
nanoparticles from the inlet to the 6th to 10th stage 
of the MOUDI exists due to the convection-diffusion 
mechanism, which increases with decreasing dpa. For 
the MOUDI, total loss is 2.9 to 15.3 % (dpa: 105.8 to 
15.4 nm) for the inlet to the 6th stage and it 
increases to 20.1 to 26.1 % (dpa: 23 to 15.4 nm) for 
the inlet to the 10th stage, respectively. Similar 
but slightly lower loss also exists in the NMCI. 
Field comparison tests in the ambient air show that 
mass size distributions measured by the MOUDI agree 
well with those of the NMCI. Finally, nozzle clogging 
tests using high concentration incense smokes 
indicate that the NMCI has a much less tendency for 
particles to clog in the nozzles than the MODUI.

ABSTRACT 
This study is aimed to investigate or solve the practical problems when using the 
cascade impactors including solid particle bounce, nozzle clogging and interstage loss. 
For solid particle bounce, the effect of ambient relative humidity (RH) on solid 
particle bounce from the uncoated impaction substrate was investigated. Results 
showed that decreasing RH in general increased particle bounce from uncoated 
substrates with the bounce from uncoated aluminum foils (ALs) being more severe 
than from Teflon filters (TFs). Particle bounce did not influence the overall mass 
distribution of ambient fine particles when RH ranged between 40 to 80 % while it 
severely under-sampled particles greater than 2.5 µm in aerodynamic diameter. 
Oversampling of PM0.1 by as much as 95-180 % or 25-50 % occurred when the 
MOUDI used uncoated ALs or TFs, respectively, as RH was reduced from 50 to 25%. 
Particle bounce was reduced substantially and PM0.1 was found to be sampled 
accurately with less than 5 % of error by the MOUDIs with uncoated ALs and TFs at 
the RH > 75 and 65 %, respectively.  
In addition to particle bounce, the other practical problem is nozzle clogging. To 
resolve this problem, the NCTU micro-orifice cascade impactor (NMCI) was 
developed. In the NMCI, new nozzle plates with smooth nozzle shape made by the 
LIGA (Lithography, Electroplating, and Molding) process were used to replace the 7th 
to 10th stages in one of the MOUDI. To evaluate the sampling performance of the 
NMCI, the NMCI and the MOUDI were tested for the particle collection efficiency 
curves and interstage loss of nanoparticles. Test results show that after adjusting 
proper S/W ratios (S: jet to plate distance, W: nozzle diameter), the cutoff 
aerodynamic diameters (dpa50) are close to the nominal values given in Marple et al. 
(1991). Total interstage loss of nanoparticles from the inlet to the 6th to 10th stage of 
the MOUDI exists due to the convection-diffusion mechanism, which increases with 
decreasing dpa. For the MOUDI, total loss is 2.9 to 15.3 % (dpa: 105.8 to 15.4 nm) for 
the inlet to the 6th stage and it increases to 20.1 to 26.1 % (dpa: 23 to 15.4 nm) for the 
inlet to the 10th stage, respectively. Similar but slightly lower loss also exists in the 
NMCI. Field comparison tests in the ambient air show that mass size distributions 
measured by the MOUDI agree well with those of the NMCI. Finally, nozzle clogging 
tests using high concentration incense smokes indicate that the NMCI has a much less 
tendency for particles to clog in the nozzles than the MODUI.

with saturated NaCl solution to control the RH at about 75±2% of aerosol flow 
entering the uncoated 10 stage MOUDI (MSP Model 110) during field samplings at 
Las Vegas with low RHs of about 10 to 30%. The percent of sulfate mass on the after 
filter (or PM0.056) to the sum of all stages of the conditioned MOUDI was compared 
with that of a collocated unconditioned MOUDI. It was found that the bounce of fine 
ambient particles in the conditioned MOUDI was largely eliminated when the 
sampled aerosol flow was above ~70% RH. However, there was a tendency for the 
sulfate loading at the after filter to decrease with increasing RH. The average percent 
of sulfate mass on MOUDI after filter was 2 and 4%, respectively, for the conditioned 
and unconditioned MOUDIs, which implied that unconditioned MOUDI oversampled 
PM0.056 by 100%. They concluded that accurate mass distribution of ambient 
particles could be obtained by MOUDI when RHs were kept at above ~70% but 
below 80% for fear that flow-induced sizing errors might occur (Fang et al., 1991). 
Stein et al. (1994) used a Tandem Differential Mobility Analyser (TDMA) with a 
relative humidity conditioner to study the bounce of atmospheric 0.25 µm particles in 
a one stage 0.1 µm cutsize impactor in which uncoated aluminum foils (ALs) were 
used as the impaction substrates. They found the bounce of 0.25 µm particles 
increased sharply as relative humidity decreased below 60-70%. At RHs of 50, 40, 30 
and 20%, about 10, 20, 40 and 70% of incoming 0.25 µm particles bounced. Less than 
3% of particles bounced when the relative humidity was kept at 70-80%, when the 
surface loading effect on bounce was also found to be negligible. Dzubay et al. (1976) 
studied particle bounce of larger particles in the Anderson 2000 cascade impactor 
which had the size cuts of 7.0, 3.3, 2.0 and 1.1 µm. In the study, two of the impactors 
in parallel were compared near a freeway, one of which used vacuum grease coated 
ALs as impaction substrates while the other used uncoated ALs. The grease coated 
impactor was regarded as the reference sampler. They found the MMAD (mass 
median aerodynamic diameter) of the uncoated impactor was 2-5 times smaller than 
the coated impactor due to particle bounce. 
It is very important to obtain the interstage loss data when calibrating a cascade 
impactor, since it may result in the shift of the collection efficiency curve to the 
smaller particle size (Liu et al. 2011) or even lift the left tail end of the curve (Hillamo 
and Kauppinen, 1991). The interstage loss in the MOUDI was measured during its 
initial development (Marple et al. 1991). However, the loss for nanoparticles with the 
diameter smaller than the dpa50 of each of the lower stages was not tested. In addition, 
the loss of nanoparticle can occur in the upstream stages before a certain lower stage, 
which is hard to measure because the loss per stage is small unless the test is 
conducted from the inlet to a specific lower stage. In Virtanen et al. (2001), particles 
with the size from 10 to 400 nm were used to measure the loss for the 5th to 12th stage

silicone grease coated ALs (M1, reference MOUDI) and the other used uncoated ALs 
(M2) or uncoated Teflon filters (TFs, M3) as the impaction substrates. The present 
experimental setup enabled the study of particle bounce at different conditioned RHs 
(10-98%). Conditioned aerosol flow was introduced simultaneously into both 
MOUDIs to exclude the effect of particle loss since the same inlet was used. The 
second is to calibrate the particle collection efficiency curves of the 7th to 10th stages 
of the NMCI and those of the MOUDI ensuring the dpa50 values match with the 
nominal values given in Marple et al. (1991). After that, the total interstage loss of 
nanoparticles from the inlet to each lower stage (7th to 10th) of both NMCI and 
MOUDI was measured. The comparison test of the collocated NMCI and MOUDI 
was also conducted in two ambient air monitoring stations. Finally, to examine if 
nozzle clogging occurs in both cascade impactors, the pressure drop across the inlet to 
the 9th stage of the cascade impactors was monitored during sampling of incense 
smokes of high concentration. After the test, nozzle was examined under a 
microscope for possible nozzle clogging.

only PM0.1 was collected by the after filter. That is, the cutsizes of the MOUDIs in 
this study were 18, 10, 5.6, 2.5, 1.8, 1.0, 0.56, 0.32, 0.18 and 0.1 µm at sampling flow 
rate of 30 L/min. Teflon filters (TefloR2PL037, Pall Corp., New York, US) were used 
at the after filter stage of each of every tested MOUDIs while three different 
impaction substrates were used in stage 0-9 of three different MOUDIs, respectively, 
including grease coated ALs (M1), uncoated ALs (M2) and uncoated TFs (M3, 
TefloR2PL047, Pall Corp., New York, US). Conditioned aerosol flow was 
simultaneously introduced into M1 and M2 or M1 and M3, respectively, and the 
effect of particle bounce on PM measurement was determined by comparing the PM 
mass concentration collected on every stage of the MOUDIs as:

where Ci M1, Ci M2 and Ci M3 are the PM mass concentrations at stage i of M1, M2 and 
M3, respectively (i=0-9 for impaction stages, i=10 for after filter stage). The effect of 
particle bounce on PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations was also examined, when PM2.5 
and PM10 were calculated as the sum of PM mass concentrations from i=4 to i=10 (or 
after filter) and i=2 to i=10, respectively, and also based on the collection efficiency 
curve of EPA PM2.5 Well Impactor Ninety-Six (Peters et al., 2001) and Hi-Vol 
Sampler (McFarland et al., 1984), respectively. 
The M1 was regarded as the reference MOUDI since it was comparable with a 
collocated SMPS (Model 3936, TSI Inc., MN, USA) for PM0.32, PM0.18 and PM0.1, 
illustrating particle bounce was significantly eliminated of M1 by the use of grease 
coated substrate in the MOUDI of this study. In our previous study, MOUDI M1 
using the uncoated ALs and the Teflon after filter was applied to obtain the chemical 
mass closure of PM0.1 at different atmospheric environments successfully (Chen et al., 
2010a; b). The PM0.1 concentration measured by M1 was found to agree with that 
converted from the number concentration of a SMPS by using the effective density 
obtained by Chen et al. (2010a). Besides, the PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations of M1 
were also found to be in very good agreement with those of a collocated Dichotomous 
sampler (Model SA-241, Andersen Inc., Georgia, USA) with an average relative 
difference of less than 6.3±1.7% (average ± standard deviation). 
Before particle bounce test, three MOUDIs (M1, M2 and M3), all of which used 
grease coated AL substrates in stages 0-9 and TF in the after filter were collocated to 
compare the mass distributions of atmospheric aerosols to ensure no bias between 
them. Totally five 24-h measurements were conducted. In addition, two MOUDIs

the atomization and electrostatic classifier technique for the test. Polydisperse 
particles were first generated by the constant output atomizer (TSI Model 3076) from 
the DOS solution with the concentration from 0.001 to 0.1 % (v/v). The aerosol flow 
was passed through a tubular furnace at a fixed temperature of 300 0C to produce a 
relatively narrow size distribution by the evaporation-condensation process. 
Monodisperse, singly charged particles were then generated by the electrostatic 
classifier (EC, TSI Model 3080) equipped with the nano-differential mobility analyzer 
(DMA, TSI Model 3085) or the long-DMA (TSI Model 3081). To minimize the effect 
of multiple charges on the monodispersity of the classified particles (Pui and Liu, 
1979), only particles larger than the count median diameter (CMD) were classified. 
When calibrating the particle collection efficiency of a single lower stage, a ball valve 
was used to simulate the pressure drop created by all previous upstream stages. The 
following equation was then used to calculate the particle collection efficiency (η) or 
interstage loss (L) as:

3.2 Particle loss in the humidity conditioner 
Figure 5 shows the comparison of mass distributions between the MOUDI with 
the humidity conditioner installed and that without. There was no control of the RH 
for the MOUDI with humidity conditioner and both MOUDIs sampled aerosols at 
RHs of 80-95%. The MMADs of the accumulation and coarse particle modes of the 
MOUDI with the conditioner were found to be 3.56 and 0.45, respectively, while 
those without were 3.95 and 0.45 µm, respectively. Similar accumulation mode 
MMADs and mass concentrations in each stage below the 2.5 µm cutsize stage 
between the two MOUDIs indicated that particles loss in the humidity conditioner 
was low for fine particles. However, a smaller coarse mode MMAD (with difference 
of ~10%) and a lower mass concentrations in each stage above the 2.5 µm stage of the 
MOUDI with the conditioner than that without was found, indicating loss of coarse 
particles occurred in the humidity conditioner. Loss of >PM18 (stage 0), PM10-18 (stage 
1), PM5.6-10 (stage 2) and PM2.5-5.6 (stage 3) was 72.5, 52.3, 20.9 and 5.3%, 
respectively, in the conditioner leading to the underestimation of these large particles. 
PM0.1 concentrations of the two collocated MOUDIs, which were 0.56 and 0.53 µg/m3, 
respectively, were in very good agreement with a difference of only 5.4%. Other five 
repeated measurements showed similar results.

3.3 Particle bounce effect on mass distribution 
Figure 7 compares the mass distributions and fitted MMADs of M1 with those of 
M2 and M3 at 25, 50 and 75% of RH. The data shown here for these RHs was 
because they covered dry, moderate and wet conditions of aerosols when particle 
bounce can be observed and quantified simply. Again, the substrates in M1, M2 and 
M3 were greased coated ALs, uncoated ALs and uncoated TFs, respectively. Both 
accumulation and coarse MMADs of M2 and M3 were in good agreement with those 
of M1 at 50 and 75% RHs as shown in Figures 7 (c-f). Consistent agreement was 
found for the accumulation MMAD as RH reduced to 25% (Figures 7 (a) and (b)). 
However, discrepancy of the coarse MMAD occurred between coated M1 and 
uncoated M2 and M3 at this decreased RH, meanwhile mass distribution of M2 and 
M3 was observed to shift toward smaller diameters obviously compared with M1. A 
more severe of shifting toward the left was found at RH < 25% for both M2 and M3 
(data was not shown).  
  
17
Comparing the collected PM mass of M1 with those of M2 and M3, it was found 
that M1 sampled more PM2.5-10 mass (sum of stages 2 and 3) than M2 and M3 
significantly at both RHs of 25 and 50%. M2 was more different from M1 than M3 as 
the RH was same. M2 and M3 undersampled PM2.5-10 by 22.5 and 14.2% at RHs of 
50%, respectively, while those at 25% RH were 11.0 and 10.2%. Besides, M2 and M3 
were also found to undersample PM2.5-10 even at the RH as high as ~75% (Figures 7 
(e-f)) when the differences were both reduced to below 7%. The difference was found 
to reduce further at RH of 80-98% when it was < ~3% (data was not shown). Since 
the undersampling of PM2.5-10 reduced with increasing RH, it could be attributed to 
the occurrence of particle bounce in M2 and M3 at RH < 75%. The finding of particle 
bounce for particles larger than 2.5 µm was in agreement with that has been observed 
by Dzubay et al. (1976). Note that more accurate sample of coarse particle (PM2.5-10) 
could be collected only when RH was increased to ~80% once uncoated MOUDI was 
used. Importantly, the bouncing particles were found to get loss on the inner wall of 
MOUDI rather than jump to lower stages because PM mass did not increase 
correspondingly at stages after the stage of 2.5 µm cut. This was also demonstrated by 
the observation that particles deposited on the inner wall in stages 0-3 of MOUDI.  
The average PM0.1 determined by M1 for the total forty samples was 0.8±0.3 
µg/m3 (average ± standard deviation), which was comparable to the average 
concentration at the urban areas in LA obtained by Cass et al. (2000). As was 
mentioned previously, the present M1 sampled a close PM0.1 to the collocated SMPS. 
These indicate that the present M1 can be used to determine the overestimation of 
PM0.1 by M2 and M3 as bounce occurred. 
It was found M2 and M3 both collected very close PM0.1 to M1 at RH of 75% as 
shown in Figures 7 (e) and (f). However, it was observed that bouncing particles from 
front stages (normally stages 9 and 8) contributed to PM0.1 sample with a significant 
amount of >30% (shown more detailed later) at RHs of 25 and 50% as seen in Figure. 
7 (a-d). The quantity of PM0.1 oversampling at 25% RH was very close to that shown 
in Figure 9 of Vasiliou et al. (1999). Note that, accurate PM0.1 sample can be obtained 
as RH is high enough, typically >75% RH, even uncoated substrates are used in the 
MOUDI but significant error on PM0.1 concentration exists at low RH (<50%) once 
bounce occurs. Particles could also bounce from middle stages (4-6 stages) and be 
collected at lower stages (7-after filter) at RH of 25% when uncoated ALs were used 
as shown in Figures 7 (a) and (b). In addition, more severe bounce in M2 than M3 at 
the same RH (25 or 50%) for PM0.1 was found, which could be due to more rigid 
surface of uncoated ALs than TFs. 
Accumulation mode particles include products of combustion processes and are 
considered on a mass basis to be more toxic because they contain hazardous materials 
  
19
from pooling both data of M2 and M3 since they showed a similar trend. From the 
figure, it is observed that ratios of M2 and M3 to M1 are close to 1 for all PMs at high 
RHs of 75-98%. Surprisingly, the PM2.5 ratios of M2 and M3 were both found to be 
near 1 even when RH decreased from 75 to 10 % or to 20%, respectively. However, 
PM10 ratios were decreased to ~0.75 and ~0.8 for M2 and M3, respectively at these 
low RHs. This was due to particle loss of coarse particle (PM2.5-10) at the reduced RH 
as discussed previously. Although M2 and M3 sampled a close PM2.5 to M1 even at 
low RH of 10 or 20%, their mass distribution and accumulation MMADs deviated 
from those of M1 as shown in Figures 7(a-b) and Figure 8, respectively. This is 
because bouncing fine particles contributed to the following stage samples rather than 
lost in the MOUDI inner wall as coarse particles.

Particle bounce, leading to the oversampling of PM0.1 was illustrated in this 
study. The quantity of PM0.1 oversampling for both M2 and M3 increased with 
decreasing RH, where M2 was more severe than M3 at the same RH. This was 
because Teflon filter has fibrous porous structure and fine particles can easily get 
impacted and filtered by the substrate with less particle bounce and blowing off. As a 
result, uncoated TF MOUDI samples much less PM0.1 in the after filter as compared

The above calibration results are for the individual stages of the two cascade 
impactors. When the upstream stages are present, the total collection efficiency curves 
form the inlet to one of the lower stages is shown in Figure 11. The left tail ends of the 
total collection efficiency curves are seen to lift upward when the upstream stages are 
present due to the convectional diffusion of nanoparticles in the stages. Similar results 
were also found in previous studies (Marple et al. 1991; Tsai et al. 2012). It can also

3.6 Interstage loss of nanoparticles in the NMCI and the MOUDI 
Figure 12 shows the total interstage loss of nanoparticles from the inlet to each of 
the lower stages of the NMCI and those of the MOUDI. It is noted that in order to 
distinguish the interstage loss of nanoparticles from the collection efficiency of the 9th 
and 10th stages, only particles with dpa near the lower end of the collection efficiency 
curve where dpa < dpa50 were used for the tests, which were 15.4 to 42.5 and 15.4 to 25 
nm, respectively. For other stages, nanoparticles with dpa from 15.4 to 105 nm were 
used. Results show that total nanoparticle loss increases with decreasing dpa due to 
convectional diffusion deposition. The maximum loss from the inlet to the 6th to 10th 
stage occurs at dpa of 15.4 nm, which is 11.39 to 23.47 % for the NMCI, and 12.83 to 
26.13 % for the MOUDI. The total interstage loss of nanoparticles in the NMCI is 
slightly lower than those in the MOUDI due to smoother nozzle shape of the former. 
For both impactors, a significant total interstage loss of nanoparticles from the inlet to 
one of the lower stages (7th to 10th) exists especially for nanoparticles with the 
diameter smaller than 40 nm. For nanoparticles larger than 40 nm, the total interstage 
loss is less than 10 % and it decreases with increasing particle diameter. It is therefore 
important to consider the nanoparticle loss in the 10th stage when determining the 
mass distributions of nanoparticles.

which is less than 1.6 and 1.8 %, if the total loss LT,6 of 11.39 and 12.83 % is assumed 
to be evenly divided in the inlet to 6th stages for the NMCI and the MOUDI, 
respectively.

3.7 Field comparison and nozzle clogging test 
The ambient mass size distributions measured by the NMCI and those by the 
collocated MOUDI are shown in Figure 14. The mass size distributions measured by 
the NMCI are seen to be very close to those by the MOUDI. Most of the data between 
the stages of these two cascade impactors have the relative difference of less than 10 
%.

Figure 15 shows the results of nozzle clogging test expressed in terms of the 
variation of pressure drop (△P) across the inlet to 7th or the 8th to 9th stage of the 
NMCI and the MOUDI during sampling of high concentration incense smokes for 45 
min. It can be clearly seen that △P increase in the MOUDI is significantly higher than 
that of the NMCI across the 8th to 9th stage. That means particle clogging in the 8th and 
9th stage nozzles of the former is more severe than those of the latter. Micrographs 
shown in Figure 16 provide further evidence of nozzle clogging in the 7th to 10th 
stages of the MOUDI while it is much less severe in the NMCI. That is, the new 
nozzle plates in the lower stages of the NMCI outperform those of the MOUDI in 
preventing nozzle clogging.

Based on the present experimental results and Fang et al. (1991) who found 
flow-induced humidity changes on size cut was negligible at RH <80%, it is 
concluded accurate PM2.5 and PM0.1 can be obtained with less than 5 % of error at 
RHs of 65-80% and 75-80% by using uncoated TFs and uncoated ALs in MOUDIs, 
respectively. The optimal RH can be achieved in 5 min by using the present humidity 
control system which has a negligible loss for fine particles and UFPs. 
Although elevating RH to reduce bounce could lead to shifting the size 
distribution of sampling particles, Vasiliou et al. (1999) reported that particles are 
sampled at a known RH then its size distribution at other RHs can be obtained if the 
dependence of size on RH is known. The relationship between particle size and RH 
can be measured by the TDMA or calculated using thermodynamic models. Besides, 
the relationship also can be determined by the present humidity control system. 
To avoid possible particle clogging in the nozzles, new nozzle plates with smooth 
shaped nozzles were fabricated by the LIGA process. The micro-orifice cascade 
impactor using the new nozzle plates in the 7th to 10th stages (NMCI) and the MOUDI 
were studied for the particle collection efficiency and nanoparticle interstage loss. In 
addition, field comparison and nozzle clogging tests were conducted. Calibration 
results show that after adjusting the S/W ratios to proper values, the dpa50 of the 7th to 
10th stage of the NMCI and those of the MOUDI are very close to the nominal values 
given in Marple et al. (1991). It is also found that the dpa50 of the nanoparticle stages 
(9th and 10th) of the MOUDI obtained from the single stage calibration will decrease 
by 9.4 and 15.4 %, respectively, if all upstream stages are present. 
For both impactors, a significant total interstage loss of nanoparticles from inlet to 
one of the lower stages (7th to 10th) exists especially for nanoparticles with dpa smaller 
than 40 nm. For nanoparticles larger than 40 nm, the total interstage loss is less than 
10 % and it decreases with increasing particle diameter. It is therefore important to 
consider the nanoparticle loss in the 10th stage of the cascade impactors when 
determining the mass distributions of nanoparticles. If the size distribution of 
nanoparticles smaller than 56 nm is to be determined by using the instrument such as 
the 13-stage MOUDI-II (MSP, Model 122 or 125), nanoparticle loss in the stages 11 
to 13 is expected to be even more severe and warrants further investigation. 
Field sampling results show that the mass size distributions measured by the 
NMCI agree well with those of the MOUDI. The nozzle clogging test further 
indicates that the NMCI outperforms the MOUDI in preventing possible nozzle 
clogging. In addition, the present NMCI has a sturdy nozzle structure, which allows 
ultra-sonication of the plates for better cleaning efficiency to remove deposited 
particles in the nozzles. It is expected that the NMCI can facilitate the accurate 
size-classified measurements of nanoparticles in the future.
