1. Introduction 
 
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) that provide a cost-effective alternative to conventional solar cells 
have attracted intensive studies [1-8]. The cells consist of a dye-adsorbed mesoporous metal-oxide film 
filled with iodide/triiodide redox electrolyte and a Pt counter electrode. The mesoporous metal-oxide 
film with a large surface area plays a crucial role for the high performance of DSSCs [9-11]. It not only 
adsorbs a large number of dye molecules for efficient light-harvesting, but also serves as a 
semiconductor to provide a pathway for electron percolating through the film. The crystalline structure 
of the metal oxide semiconductor significantly affects the transport efficiency of the injected electrons 
[12-18]. Anatase TiO2 has been considered so far the optimum choice of the semiconductor constituting 
the mesoporous film [19]. In this application phase-pure anatase TiO2 is expected to facilitate efficient 
electron transport and avoid charge recombination [12-19].  
To fabricate the mesoporous TiO2 film, hydrolysis of a titanium alkoxide through a sol-gel route was 
generally employed to prepare a colloidal suspension that was used for deposition on the substrate [1-
8,20-22]. Anatase, rutile and brookite are the three TiO2 polymorphs [23-24]. Because in the sol-gel 
route TiO2 nanoparticles were derived from condensation of the hydrated Ti4+ ions, a TiO2 colloid of 
phase-pure anatase can hardly be obtained even if the hydrolysis and condensation kinetics are 
delicately controlled [25-28]. Previous studies using Raman spectroscopic analysis showed that brookite 
phase was generally present in the anatase TiO2 colloids derived from the sol-gel route [27,28]. The 
anatase polymorph, differing from the other two, owns a specific zigzag configuration of the edge-
shared TiO6 octahedra along a particular crystalline direction. Taking advantage of the zigzag feature, 
the present work wishes to report a unique route, alternative to the sol-gel method, to prepare the 
anatase TiO2 film for DSSCs. In this developed route, a titanate with its TiO6 octahedra arranged in a 
zigzag configuration would be produced as an intermediate. 
It has been reported that thermal treatment of TiO2 particles, either anatase or rutile, in alkali solutions 
resulted in formation of nanotubes [29-51]. The process of this treatment is rather unsophisticated. The 
 4
route was analogous to those reported by Grätzel and co-workers [20-22]. In brief, 20 mL of titanium 
isopropoxide was added to 120 mL of 0.1 M nitric acid under vigorous stirring. Immediately after the 
hydrolysis, the slurry was heated to 80°C and stirred vigorously for 2 h, to achieve peptization. Then, 
the colloidal suspension was introduced into an autoclave that was heated at 240°C for 12 h. The 
resulting TiO2 colloid from the sol-gel synthesis is designated as S240. 
The phase identification of the samples was conducted with powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a 
Rigaku RINT2000 diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation. The phase was analyzed with Raman 
scattering using a Dilor XY-100 spectrometer. The microstructure was explored with a high-resolution 
transmission electron microscope (HRTEM; Hitachi FE-2000). The N2 surface area was determined 
with the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation at -196°C, using an adsorption apparatus 
(Micromeritics, ASAP 2010).  
The solution of each TiO2 colloid, H240, S240 or P25, was mixed with polyethylene glycol (PEG; 
Fluka, 20,000 in molecular weight) to form a viscous TiO2 dispersion at a PEG/TiO2 ratio of 0.4. The 
dispersion was then spread onto a conducting glass substrate (F-doped SnO2 overlayer TCO glass; TEC 
8, Hartford Glass Co.). The apparent area of the film was 0.5 x 0.5 cm2. The TiO2-coated (0.5 x 0.5 cm2) 
substrate was subsequently calcined at 450°C in air for 30 min to form a mesoporous electrode. 
Transmission spectra of the different TiO2 films supported on the conducting glass were obtained by 
using a UV-Vis spectrometer (Varian CARI-100) and corrected for conducting glass background.  
The ruthenium complex dye, N3 (cis-di(thiocyanate)bis(2,2’-bipyridyl-4,4’-dicarboxylate) ruthenium 
(II); ruthenium 535, Solaronix), was used as the sensitizer for DSSCs. The dye-sensitized TiO2 
electrode and a Pt-coated conducting glass were assembled to form a cell by sandwiching a redox (I-/I3-) 
electrolyte solution, which was composed of 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-n-
propylimidazolium iodide, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile. In the cell performance test, 
an Oriel 300-W Xe lamp served as a light source in conjunction with an IR filter (Oriel 59044). The AM 
1.5 Globle filter (Oriel 81094) was placed in the light beam to simulate the AM 1.5-type solar emission, 
with an intensity on the cell fixed at 100 mWcm-2.

sol-gel derived S240 in Fig. 1. Only the anatse phase can be obviously observed in the patterns for H240 
and S240. On the other hand, P25 is known to contain both anatase (70%) and rutile (30%) [2]. The 
particle sizes, examined with TEM images, are of ca. 24, 16 and 12 nm for P25, H240 and S240, 
respectively, with corresponding BET surface areas of 50, 97 and 110 m2g-1 for these colloids. 
The TiO2 colloids were further subjected to analysis using Raman spectroscopy. The presence of the 
brookite polymorph has been reported for the anatase TiO2 nanoparticles prepared from the sol-gel route 
[27,28]. Fig. 3 shows the Raman spectra of the H240 and S240 colloids. The most distinctive peaks at 
638, 517, 398 and 145 cm-1 are assigned to the anatase phase, while those at 240 cm-1 the rutile and 362 
and 320 cm-1 the brookite [54-57]. The results obtained from the Raman analysis clearly reflects that 
S240 is predominantly composed of anatase while with the presence of a minute amount of rutile and 
brookite. The appearance of rutile, which is the most stable polymorph of TiO2, should result from the 
thermal effect [9]. In an auxiliary experiment for the sol-gel synthesis of TiO2 colloids at lower 
autoclaving temperatures (e.g. 230°C), we found only the presence of the predominant anatase and 
minute brookite while no rutile was detectable. On the other hand, H240 is of nearly phase-pure anatase 
TiO2 as shown in the Raman spectra. This difference in the crystalline phase has to be attributed to the 
different mechanisms involved in nucleation or crystal growth.  
Sol-gel chemistry is very commonly involved for preparing nanosized TiO2 colloids. In order to 
obtain monodispersed particles of desired size and material morphology, the precursor chemistry and 
precipitation environment are critical mechanistic factors that have to be taken into account during 
hydrolysis and precipitate formation [9,10]. Additional peptization has been designed to segregate the 
precipitates to produce a sol which is subsequently subjected to hydrothermal Ostward ripening, a 
mechanism describing crystal growth in terms of growth of large particles at the cost of smaller ones. In 
the hydrolysis and precipitation at elevated temperatures, a rapid nucleation and crystallization of TiO2 
are expected and the crystal growth is thus governed by kinetics, rather than thermodynamics. Under 
this circumstance, the simultaneous formation of anatase and brookite polymorphs, both are metastable, 
in the sol-gel synthesis is favored, as reflected by the results of the present work. In the preparation of 
 8
   Voc  =  (kT/e)·ln(Jinj/(ncb·ket·[I3-])) 
where k is the Boltzman constant, T the cell temperature, e the charge on the electron, ncb the 
concentration of electrons at the TiO2 surface, and ket the rate constant for I3- reduction. Due to the 
occurrence of the interaction at the film surface, the distance required for the photo-induced electrons to 
diffuse thus affects the degree of electron loss into recombination. Transmission spectra for such TiO2 
films, as shown in Fig. 6, are obtained to estimate the degree of photon energy penetration into the film. 
The H240 film exhibits a transparent feature. This feature should result from a low-degree light 
scattering of the film, even though the constituting H240 colloid has a larger particle size than S240. 
The presence of rutile phase, which was reported to be more efficient in scattering white light than 
anatase [19], can be one of the causes for the lower transmittance of the S240 and P25 films. Due to the 
lack of light-scattering in the H240 film, charge carriers are generated uniformly over the whole film 
thickness [1-5]. This would lead to a long distance for the photo-injected electrons to diffuse and thus a 
large number of recombination centers. This may explain, in part, the smaller Voc for H240 in 
comparison with those for the S240 and P25.  
On the other hand, the H240 cell shows the largest darkcurrent under a voltage bias. This may reflect 
a higher mobility of electrons in the H240 film, in accordance with the argument drawn from the large 
Jsc exhibited by H240. The large Jsc of the H240 film has led to the highest light-to-electric energy 
conversion efficiency (η) for the H240. The efficiency shown in Fig. 5 is calculated according to 
   η   =   (Jopt·Vopt)/Pin 
where Jopt and Vopt are respectively the current and voltage for maximum power output and Pin the 
power of incident light.  
Even though the photocurrent of the H240 film is the highest among the three types of films, a 
significant loss of red light in the H240 cell is anticipated due to the transparent feature of the film. The 
photocurrent response of DSSCs to red light has been shown to increase due to the enhancement of the 
light scattering in the TiO2 films [9,58-60]. Thus, the scattering capability of the film strongly 
influences the global values of both Jsc and η. Again, we have to emphasize that the high-purity in 
 10
generally present because of the competitive, rather than exclusive, formation of the three different 
polymorphs. Owing to the high-crystallinity feature that facilitates electron transport, the mesoporous 
TiO2 films composed of the high-purity anatase nanoparticles exhibit a high performance in dye-
sensitized solar cells. By covering the transparent films of the high-purity anatase with a scattering layer 
to improve red-light harvesting, the resulting photocurrent and energy-conversion efficiency of the cells 
can be significantly improved. Because of the high-purity feature of the products, the titanate-directed 
route also allows a larger flexibility for the growth of anatase nanocrystals while remaining the contents 
of the other phases to a minimum level.

octahedra edge-shared in a zigzag configuration, which can be correlated with the principal unit layer of 
the anatase TiO2 projected along [101].
