2INTRODUCTION
The concentration of volatile organic compound (VOC) at equilibrium, at the interface
between air and water can be specified using a dimensionless partitioning coefficient (pc).

Where Cg* = the gaseous VOC concentration at equilibrium at a constant water temperature
(Tw), and CL = the liquid VOC concentration. pc can be determined experimentally using the
static method, namely the single equilibration technique (SET). SET measures Cg* in the
headspace at VOC water-gas phase concentration equilibrium, which is established within a
gas tight vessel containing VOC solution of a known CL at a constant Tw. In earlier studies by
Cheng et al., SET was identified as a feasible method of measuring the values of pc for
several hydrophilic VOCs (alcohols, methyl ethyl ketone, and isopropanol), dissolved in pure
water and artificial human sweat at Tw = 27-47oC. [1-3]
Many reports have conferred that pc is obviously influenced by parameters related to an
aqueous VOC solution, including temperature (Tw), pH, inorganic salts, oil content, and
humic acid concentration. [3-10] Liquid VOC concentration also affects the pc values of
hydrophilic components. Schwarzenbach et al. [11] claimed that highly soluble compounds
exhibit a concentration effect on pc; however, the concentration effect is less significant for
moderately or slightly soluble compounds. According to Cheng et al., the pc of ethanol for
air-pure water systems reduces 59% for aqueous ethanol concentrations ranging from 12 to
125 mg/L. [2] The pc values of other soluble VOCs, including isopropanol (IPA), isobutanol
(IBA), and methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) also exhibit the trend of ethanol pc varying with CL.
Additionally, the influence of aqueous biomass content on the pc values of VOCs is also
essential for assessing VOC emissions from natural water bodies and biological wastewater
treatment facilities. The n-octanol-water partitioning constant (Kow) is a universal parameter
for discussing the equilibrium of the biomass effect on pc of VOCs. Kow of VOC is
proportional to the bio-sorption capacity of aqueous biomass. Barton et al. reported
measurements of the partition coefficients of benzene, toluene, and trichloroethylene (log Kow
= 2.13, 2.73, and 2.42) for liquors containing various yeast biomass concentrations. [12]
According to Barton et al., the pc of benzene in the biomass system clearly decreases as low
as 10% (i.e. benzene becomes more soluble) when yeast content increases from 0 to 80000
mg/L. Moreover, the behavior of the pc of toluene and trichloroethylene also resemble that of
4Supelco company (USA) recommends using a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-coated fiber for
low molecular weight or volatile compounds.
Activated Sludge System Setup
Figure 2 illustrates the activated sludge system, which mainly consists of an aerated sludge
reactor and an Erlenmeyer flask. Both sampling of SPME for aqueous THF and sampling of
syringe in the headspace were performed in the Erlenmeyer flask. The contents in the
Erlenmeyer flask were thoroughly agitated using a magnetic stirrer with a rotating speed of
100 rpm. A metering pump fed in/draw out biomass from the 2-L aerated tank to maintain the
volume of sludge liquor in the Erlenmeyer flask at approximately 400 mL. Meanwhile, an air
compressor provided an aeration rate of 0.45 L/s to maintain the dissolved oxygen (DO) in
the aerated tank at around 3-5 mg/L. The MLSS in the reactor and exhausted VOC were,
respectively, sampled via the effluent pipelines. The sludge system was maintained at a
constant temperature of 27oC. Totally 2.4-L sludge was used for each batch of the THF
air-water partitioning equilibrium experiment.
The biomass used for all batch tests was obtained from the activated sludge in a deep aerated
tank for bio-treatment of wastewater, specifically effluent from a THF manufacturing
petrochemical plant (Plant A), located in Da-Fa Industrial District, Kaohsiung County,
Taiwan. THF and artificial substrates were mixed to feed the biomass in the laboratory of
Fooyin University as the carbon source and nutrients. The artificial substrates mainly
included whole milk powder, and added chemicals, including acetic acid, cane sugar,
potassium dihydrogen phosphate, ammonium chloride, iron chloride, urea, and sodium
hydroxide. The THF-artificial substrate liquor was diluted to provide the feeding solution of
total chemical oxygen demand (COD) = 300 mg/L, total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) = 23.5
mg/L, ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) = 14.7 mg/L, total phosphate (T-P) = 2.9 mg/L and pH
value = 7.3. Following four months of bacteria accumulation, a purely biological content of
99.0±0.5% was reached for the mixed suspended solids of activated sludge.
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was also extracted from biomass to classify the bacterial
cultures using the Phenol-Chloroform method. [18] Comparing the study data examination
with that from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), the major
bacterium cultures (microorganism ratio > 10%) included uncultured sludge bacterium (H21),
[19] uncultured planctomycete (clone CY0ARA025D03), [20] Planctomyces sp., [21] uncultured
bacterium (clone ER1_4) (NCBI sequence database), and Hyphomicrobium denitrificans
(Nikolausz et al., 2005). [22]
6RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Aqueous Tetrahydrofuran Sampling and Analysis by SPME-GCFID
Figure 3 illustrates the calibration curve of the SPME-GCFID procedure for analyzing THF
dissolved in pure water. Based on the high linearity (R2 = 1) shown in Fig. 3. The
standardized SPME-GCFID procedure has been identified as feasible for determining
aqueous THF concentration for CL = 10-400 mg/L and Tw = 27oC.
Liquid Concentration Effect of THF on The Air-water Equilibrium Partition
Figure 4 schematically depict the distributions of pc of THF for CL = 29-300 mg/L at Tw =
27oC. The oblique line of linearity for the distribution of pc values with CL indicates that the
pc of THF reduces with CL for the range of 29-300 mg/L. For instance, the pc data of THF
range from 0.00344-0.00367 (average 0.00356) at CL = 29.81±0.16 mg/L and decrease to
0.00302-0.00322 (average 0.00316) at CL = 297.75±2.28 mg/L. A decreasing percentage of
11.24% for THF pc between 29-300 mg/L is observed. Tables 2 (a) and (b) present the
examined results of one-way analysis of variation (ANOVA) associated with the 16 pc data of
THF with 5% freedom (F0.95), and the pc matrix includes 4 CL ranges for four-series tests. The
cumulative F distribution of three and twelve degrees of freedom (F3, 12) for THF is 20.3 >>
3.49, implying strong significance at the 5% significance level for THF ranging from
29.81±0.16 to 297.75±2.28 mg/L. This pc difference between high and low THF CL is
discussed in relation to Henry’s law and the aqueous solubility of THF.
From Eq. (1), the value of pc will decrease with more VOC dissolved in water. The notable
difference between the pc values for high and low CL resulted from the effect of concentration
on the pc of hydrophilic VOCs, as shown by Cheng et al.. [1-3] However, the liquid VOC
concentration does not exert a dominant influence on pc of aqueous hydrophobic
hydrocarbons, such as benzene and toluene solutions. [1, 2] According to aqueous solubility
(Table 1), THF is highly soluble in water. Therefore, the pc distribution of THF follows the
trend of pc of hydrophilic VOCs with CL. This finding indicates that the effect of liquid
concentration of VOCs, particularly hydrophilic components of high CL in water, should be
considered in assessing VOC emission rate from the wastewater treatment facilities.
Partition of THF For Agitated Water and Activated Sludge Systems
Table 3 clearly shows that the pc values of THF in agitated water and activated sludge liquor
are higher than those in pure water. Due to agitation by a submerged magnetic stirrer, more
8CONCLUSION
This investigation exactly evaluates the effects of THF liquid concentration and biomass on
THF pc values using the standardized SPME-GCFID procedure. The observation results
demonstrate that the pc values of THF in the static water reduced by up to 11% at 27oC when
aqueous THF concentration was increased from 30 to 298 mg/L. The hydrophilicity of THF
clearly increased the pc of THF between the interface of air and sludge liquor. The
experimental results reveal that the biomass effect was stronger than the liquid VOC
concentration effect on THF pc, resulting in the pc values of THF displaying a net increment
of 22.5% for the co-effect of liquid THF concentration and biomass for MLSS = 1220±86
mg/L and THF CL = 242.91±69.09 mg/L. Based on the comparison of THF emission rate
using field analysis and Water 8 model simulation, the biomass content clearly increased THF
emissions from an activated sludge reactor.
