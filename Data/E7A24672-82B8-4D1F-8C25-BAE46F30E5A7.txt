carbonization of copper-saccharides complexes. The 
Cu@C core-shell nanoparticles have been studied to 
explore potential applications in thermal interface 
materials (TIMs) and thermal dissipation of CPU and 
LED as well as photothermal cancer therapy. A simple 
and inexpensive method for synthesis of M@C (M: Cu, 
Ni, Ag, bimetallic or alloy metals) with saccharides 
as the carbon source has been developed. By adjusting 
C/M ratios, nanosize-controllable metal (Cu) embedded 
in the carbon shells (thickness = 3-5 nm) can be 
synthesized by carbonization of the metal-starch 
complexes at 673-773 K. The carbon shells can prevent 
the nanosize core metal from oxidation and 
aggregation. Expetimentally, dispersion of a small 
amount (5%) of the Cu@C nanoparticles (Cu size = 14 
nm) in a commercial thermal grease (Y-500), its 
thermal conductivity can be increased by at least 
60%. The smaller (7 nm) or larger (80 nm) Cu in the 
Cu@C nanoparticles cause an increase of the thermal 
conductivity by 10-30%. In addition, for the long-
time heat-dissipation applications, the shell carbon 
may consume the residual oxygen (C+O2 CO2) in the 
grease and expose the core copper for a better 
thermal conductivity (391 W/m-K). Kinetic parameters 
of shrinking of carbon on Cu@C by steam refoming have 
been obtained. The Arrhenius activation energy (Ea) 
for shrinking of the carbon on Cu@C with Cu sizes of 
7 nm is 165.5 kJ mol-1, which are much less than that 
(Ea = 240.5 kJ mol-1) of the hollow carbon sphere 
(H@C) with cage size of 7 nm at 573-973 K. Thermal 
dissipation of heat pipes can be enhanced with 
coating of Cu by shrinking of the carbon from Cu@C on 
the internal surfaces of heat pipes. The photothermal 
behaviors of metals and alloys embedded in carbon 
shells has been investigated with the NIR laser. The 
temperature raise of the Cu@C with Cu size of 14 nm 
under the exposure of an 809 nm Ti sapphire 
femtosecond laser with the power of 51 W/cm2 is 30 K. 
The core-shell nanoparticles with an excellent 
photothermal characteristic have immense potential 
for photothermal therapy of eradicated malignant 
tumors.

purity nitrogen (99.99%) at 573-673 K for 2 h to yield the core-shell (M@C) 
nanoparticles. Structure of the samples was characterized by X-ray diffraction 
(XRD) (Bruker, D8 Advance) which was scanned from 10 to 80
o
 (2θ) at a scanning 
rate of 3
o
/min. The Raman spectra of the shell carbon of the core-shell 
nanoparticles were determined with a 532 nm Laser (Nd:YAG) at 298 K. The 
melting temperatures of the Cu@C, Ag@C, and CuAg@C nanoparticles were 
measured on a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) coupled with differential 
scanning calorimetry (DSC) (TA instrument, SDT Q600) under ultra-high purity 
nitrogen (100 mL/min). The morphology of the samples was studied by high 
resoultion transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) (Philips, Tecnai F20) at an 
accelerating voltage of 200 kV and nano beam diffraction (NBD) patterns were 
also determined. The Cu K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure 
spectroscopy (EXAFS) spectra of the core-shell nanoparticles were determined on 
the Wiggler BL17C beamline at the Taiwan Synchrotron Radiation Research 
Center. The EXAFS data of copper in the Cu@C, Cu/Ag@C and CuPd@C 
nanoparticles were analyzed using the UWXAFS 3.0 and FEFF 8.0 simulation 
programs.8 
 
2.2 Nanosize copper embedded carbon (Cu@C) thin film onto the cathode 
Starch (Riedel-de Haën) and copper nitrates (Fluka) at the carbon 
(starch)-to-copper atomic ratios of 14, 7.0 or 4.7 were dissolved in distilled water. 
The solution was well stirred at 353 K and deposited onto ITO (SnO2:In, RITEK) 
by spin coating at a rotation rate of 2,000 rpm. After dried at 343 and 373 K for 
totally 2 hours, the starch-Cu2+ complex was carbonized under high purity nitrogen 
(99.99%) at 573-673 K for 2 hours to yield the Cu@C core-shell nanoparticle thin 
films. The Pt cathode was prepared by deposition of H2PtCl6·6H2O (Alfa Aesar) 
onto ITO by spin coating at 1,500 rpm and dried at 323 K for 15 min. The cathode 
was calcined at 658 K for 10 min and used as the standard DSSC electrode. 
 
2.3 Thermal conductivity measurements of TIMs 
Thermal conductivity of TIMs under test was measured by sensitivity TIMs 
measuring system. Different core Cu sizes of the Cu@C nanoparticles were 
impregnated with diverse weight percent in commercial thermal grease (Y-500) putted 
in the size of holders of 3 cm in diameter and 0.3-1.0 mm in thickness at a heating 
power of 20 W and a pressure of 20 kg/cm2. 
 
2.4 Photothermal measurement of the core-shell nanoparticles 
The pellets for the measurement of photothermal behaviors were prepared by 
mixing from 0.15 g of M@C and 0.15 g of HBO3 (Merck) (as the filler) at a pressure 
 4
 
The well dispersed and uniform-size nanoparticles of Cu, Cu/Ag and CuPd 
embedded in the amorphous carbon shells can be seen in Fig. 2. The nano beam 
diffraction (NBD) patterns (shown in the upper right corner of Fig. 2(a) and (b)) of 
the Cu@C nanoparticles also implicate existence of Cu coated with carbon. It is 
worth noting that the CuPd alloy nanoparticles are formed with a particle size of 
about 4 nm within the carbon shells, which is consistent with the HR-TEM 
imaging (Fig. 2(d)). The thickness of the carbon shell that prevents the core copper 
from being aggregated or oxidized ranges from 3 to 5 nm. The broadening and 
downshifting of a Raman feature at 1332 cm-1 of the Cu@C nanoparticles indicate 
that the carbon shell is nano-scale. The Raman spectra of the carbon shells also 
show that the chemical structure of the carbon is amorphous with an sp3/sp2 ratio 
of 0.7. 
 
Fig. 2 High resolution TEM images of core-shell nanoparticles. (a) and (b) well 
dispersed and uniform-size core nanosize copper (20 and 7 nm, respectively) are 
embedded within the carbon shells (about 3-5 nm in thickness). The NBD patterns 
(shown in the upper right corner of micrographs (a) and (b)) of the core copper 
implicate the existence of metallic Cu coated with carbon. (c) bimetal Cu/Ag. (d) 
the CuPd alloy nanoparticles are found with a particle size of about 4 nm. 
 
By simply manipulating the ratios of OH/M, many metal, bimetal, or alloy 
nanoparticles ranging from 4 to 40 nm can be synthesized. For example, Cu, Ag, 
Pd, Ni, and Rh with variable particle sizes (dp) in the carbon shells can be 
synthesized (Fig. 3(a)). Note that for the OH/Cu ratio of >7 the metallic copper in 
the Cu@C has a particle size of 7 nm. In general, with lower OH/M ratios, the 
particle sizes are greatly increased, e.g., 13 nm Ag at OH/M >10.5 versus 37 nm 
 6

12), (b) nanosize Cu (7 nm) (CN = 8), (c) bimetal Cu/Ag (1:1) (CN = 6) and (d) 
alloy CuPd (1:1) within the carbon shells. 
 
Surface atoms of a bulky particle are always much fewer in number than the 
total number of atoms. The ratio of surface atoms to total atoms, however, 
increases as the particle size decreases. The average CN of surface atoms also 
decreases along with the particle size. Melting temperatures of nanosize metals are 
generally dependent upon their electronic state and average CN of the participating 
atoms.10 When the average CN of atoms decreases, the particle exhibits lower 
melting points. 
Without the outer carbon shells, interparticle coalescence of nanosize metals 
may occur as temperature increases resulting in particle growth. Thus, melting 
temperature of metals cannot be measured on the nano-scale; only the melting 
temperature of the bulky metal state is detected. In the present study, depressions 
of melting temperatures of several nanosize metal/alloy particles are 
experimentally observed for the first time. The melting temperature depression 
pattern of Cu, Ag, and CuAg alloy appears to be nanosize dependent (Fig. 5). As 
expected, the observed points follow the theoretical molecular dynamic 
simulations.11,12 During the ΔT measurements, the carbon shells play an important 
role in preventing the Cu, Ag, and CuAg alloy nanoparticles from being 
aggregated and oxidized. Interestingly, the depression of melting temperatures for 
the nanosize CuAg alloy in the carbon shells can also be observed: melting 
temperature at 977 K versus 1052 K for the bulky alloy CuAg (ΔT = 75 K).

3.3 Enhanced efficiency of thermal interface materials with Cu@C 
nanoparticles 
Thermal conductivity measurements of the Cu@C dispersed TIMs were 
conducted on a TIM measuring system at the Laboratory of Professor W. K. Lin 
(National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan). The grease was filled in a cell with a size of 
3 cm in diameter and 0.3-1.0 mm in thickness. Determination of thermal 
conductivities was under a heating power of 20 W and pressure of 20 kg/cm2. 
The measurement of the thermal conductivity of TIMs is determined, and the 
thermal conductivity of TIMs may be expressed as follows: 
Rth, tot = (TL-TU)/Q= Rth, contact+ Hs/A*kTIM 
where Rth, tot is the total thermal resistance (K/W), TL is lower surface temperature of

In addition, for the long-time heat-dissipation applications, the shell carbon may 
consume the residual oxygen (C+O2ÆCO2) (shown in Fig. 10) in the grease and 
expose the core copper for a better thermal conductivity (metallic copper has a 
thermal conductivity of 395 W/m-K). The Cu@C nanoparticles dispersed thermal 
grease may, therefore, enhance efficiency and life time for promising applications in 
heat dissipation of CPU (central processing unit) or LED (light emitting diode).

3.4 Malignant tumors eradicated with light activated nano bullets 
Fig. 12 show the temperature raises of the Cu@C nanoparticles under the NIR 
laser at a power of 28 W/cm2. For comparison, HBO3 is used as a reference under 
the same power of the exciting laser (28 W/cm2). It is very clear that the 
temperatures of the Cu@C nanoparticles are rapidly raised to 311-314 K under the 
809 nm laser irradiation. The maximal raise temperature (ΔT) for the Cu@C with 
the Cu size of 14 nm is 20 K which is very effective in photothermal therapy of 
malignant cells. Note that the Cu nanowires are not as efficiency as the Cu 
nanospheres in absorption of NIR energy. The photothermal effects for the Ag@C, 
Cu/Ag@C, Ni@C, and CuNi@C are shown in Fig. 13. It seems that under the NIR 
radiation, temperatures of the nanosize Ni, Ag, CuNi alloy, or Cu/Ag bimetal can 
rise to 307-311 K. 
In Fig. 14, under the NIR radiation of the 28-51 W/cm2 power density for 30 
minutes, the temperature of the 14 nm-Cu can be risen by 20-30 K. Sizes of Cu 
may also play an important role in rising its temperature by absorption of the NIR 
light. In Fig. 15, under the 51 W/cm2 NIR radiation, the temperature of the smaller 
Cu (14 nm) can be risen by 30 K, while the 20 nm-Cu corresponds to a temperature 
rise of 27 K.

Figure 1  Dependence of the particle size (dp) (nm) of metals (within the carbon 
shells) on OH (on CDs)-to-metal (OH/M) ratio. By simply manipulating the 
ratios of OH/M, many metals such as (a) Cu, Ag, Pd, Rh, Ni, bimetal Cu/Ag 
or alloys CuPd and CuNi nanoparticles ranging 4-40 nm can be 
synthesized. (b) The synthesized metal nanoparticles have a correlation 
between dpZ/R (where Z and R denote valence of metal and atomic radius 
(nm) of metal, respectively) and OH/M ratios of 2.3-15.
