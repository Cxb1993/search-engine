四、研究方法
The proposed design flow is illustrated in Fig.1
The first stage is partition. In this phase, we use
hMetis to partition modules into layers. The
inputs from the benchmark include the connecting
relation between modules and the dimension of
modules. We translate the above information to
an integrated format. And then process the
partition with the through-via minimized
consideration.
After partitioning layers, we take another
quad-partition for each layer sequentially. This is
because after minimizing the connecting relations
between layers, the horizontal relations in the
same layer should also be considered. The main
purpose is to enhance the horizontal relation so
that we can cluster the modules that have stronger
connecting relation in the same layer.
The permuting stage works after the vertical
minimization and horizontal minimization.
Although the above partitions could minimize the
connecting relation but still not well enough. The
terminal propagation problem might make the
wire length to get worse. Fig.2. illustrates the
problem.
In Fig.2. , each one module was put at different
regions. Without terminal propagation, the upper
solution is possible. We could see that we might
get worse solution if we do not place modules
well. So that we permute regions without crossing
layers to optimize area and wire length by using
simulated annealing. Fig 3. illustrates the possible
solutions before and after permutation.
After all layers have been done, we floorplan
each regions in all layers with B*-tree and
combine the regions to the top level. Modules
would be compacted in left-bottom way that
might centralize the heat. Meanwhile, we have to
stack layer by layer so that the heat is even harder
to be dissipated.
Whitespace redistribution provides a practical
solution to refine the high temperature after the
combining stage. As the above described, high
temperature comes from compacting too many
modules in a small area and the low conductivity
insulator in 3D-stacked design. The accumulated
heat makes the temperature increase constantly.
So that the difference of width and height
between layers at the combining stage is a useful
resource that we can use to dissipate heat.
Basically, the idea is to guide the whitespace
redistribution. The modules that are located at or
near the hot point should be moved farther. The
following equations describe the work at
whitespace redistribution.

In Fig.6~8, the left-hand sides represent the
“initial”cases, while he right-hand sides represent
the cases that the whitespace redistribution has
been processed. It is clear to see that the hot point
is spread away from the left-bottom corner.
Table III represents the comparison of
temperature in detail. The “Max_th”means the
maximum temperature and the “Min_th”and the
“Avg_th”represent minimum temperature and
average temperature respectively. The “initial”
case is the same case that has been described in
wire length section.
Table IV and table V represent the difference
of temperature between the cases without
whitespace redistribution and the cases with
whitespace redistribution. The distinction of the
two tables is the partition layers. We can see that
the temperature in table V enhanced with a big
degree compared to the temperature in table IV.
Therefore, if we want to get better wire length
with more partition layers, the heat must be
dissipated well.
