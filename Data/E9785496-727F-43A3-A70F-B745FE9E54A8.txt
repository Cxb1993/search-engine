Abstract 
Diamond-like carbon (DLC) films coated on cemented WC-Co substrates were built by a 
radio frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (rf PVD) process. A TaN interlayer 
was prepared by a sputter technique to prevent the diffusion of cobalt from the substrate. The 
microstructures of DLC films were examined by Raman spectroscopy and EDX analyses. The 
mechanical properties were evaluated by pin-on disk wear test and micro-scratch test. According to 
the results, hardness of DLC films increased with the RF power, but the roughness decreased 
instead. From our previous work, the TaN monolayer would oxide and disintegrate at 600 ℃. 
DLC/TaN multilayer persist a well anti-oxidation performance even under 600 ℃. The adhesive 
strength and wear resistance of the proposed DLC/TaN coatings were discussed and their possible 
application was also addressed. The anti-wear properties of DLC/TaN coatings are examined that 
can protect substrate and have good roughness by pin-on disk test, which demonstrated a 
promising application in the optical mold industries.

2.3 射頻電漿輔助化學氣相沉積系統與
DLC 薄膜沉積 
    本實驗採用射頻電漿輔助化學氣相沉
積系統鍍製 DLC 薄膜。此系統(參見圖二)
包含了可程式控制人機介面、真空系統、
氣氛、電漿電源供應器、直流偏壓產生器。
真空系統部分採用渦輪分子式幫浦及迴轉
式機械幫浦各一個;氣氛為 CH4、Ar、H2
與 N2 等氣體;電漿電源供應部分採用直流
電源供應器;直流偏壓則採用負偏壓。  
經前處理後鍍好的TaN試片置入腔
內，待真空度降至6x10-5 torr以下後通入10 
sccm的Ar，rf功率80w清潔10分鐘。接著關
閉Ar與rf，待真空度下降到10-4 torr再通入
如表二之實驗參數，此做法是為了避免前
處理製程影響沉積製程。 
  
3.實驗結果與討論 
    本實驗拉曼光譜分析結果使用氦氖雷
射光源(波長為 632 nm)分析試片。在光學
顯微鏡倍率 50 倍下(參見圖三、四)，各組
參數所顯示的波長分析結果如圖五、圖六
所示。可看出在 DLC7 與 8 的製程參數條
件，在 1332cm-1 與 1580cm-1有 DLC 的峯
值。根據有系統的探討，我們運用最佳的
結果在被覆有含鈷之碳化鎢底材上。之後
除了進行高溫氧化爐之測試外，並以刮痕
實驗，配合 pin-on-disk 的實驗評估。最後
雖然高溫抗氧化能力僅有限度的獲得提
升，然而整體的結合性與抗磨耗能力卻大
幅度的成長。 
 
4. 結論 
   以 TaN 擔任含鈷碳化鎢的的擴散阻障
層，可以有效避免底材之鈷元素干擾類碳
鑽膜的成長，但是其本身卻有無法抵抗高
溫氧化的缺點。透過化學氣相沉積方法，
被覆類鑽薄膜在表層後，不僅可以改善這
個狀況，使整體鍍膜壽命獲得提升，亦可
以降低摩擦力，提升整體的結合能力，但
是如果能進一步提升整體的抗高溫氧化性
能，將更有助於光學玻璃壓鑄模具的工業
應用。

貳、計畫成果自評 
計畫規劃階段本以鑽石鍍膜之經驗預
計以含鈷中間層當作阻障材質，然而經過
與合作之材料所同仁深入探討後，決定逕
將所用之中間層改為氮化鉭，該材質在其
它文獻之研究比較下，比鉻化物更適合在
本研究的運用對象上。執行之初，由於所
使用之 rf CVD 為新建之系統，在計畫經費
不夠充分之下，在多方面的協調下，才將
高度真空所需的渦輪真空幫浦安裝定位，
然而射頻系統的高頻訊號干擾雖在預期中
加以避免，但是電磁引發的鐵磁熱效應，
卻造成氣密材料的變形與洩漏，遂使進度
嚴重落後。 
基本上本計畫的目標是尚未達成的，雖
然對所有計畫執行人員，都因為參與從無
到有的過程，而學到許多的工程經驗。但
是成果仍需繼續努力的累積，相信在未來
的一年內將可獲得遲來的豐碩成效。 
 
 
 真正的成功應該是在有限的資源下，能夠完成別人達不到的成果。 
 
此次美西之行大會安排的參觀之旅很晚，會影響到回程。所以我們利用空檔到了美墨邊
境和沿途的幾個 mall逛了一下，也到了 lahola海濱看看壯麗的海峽與可愛的海豹族群。聖地
牙哥的確很適合開會，有著宜人的氣候，陽光普照卻不會太強烈，海洋港口的景緻，加上市
區人車數量不多，步行在其間感到十分的從容。在幾天的緊湊議程後，我們藉著這個機會認
識了此行的許多學界朋友。從發表的論文來看，目前台灣多從學理配合實驗來進行研究，但
是其他國家就比較偏向工業的實際運用方向。材料這個領域常常在初步成果後就要儘快發
表，以達到新穎的目的。由於此次發表的成果極有產業應用的好處，所以我們已經開始申請
專利之程序有一段時間，希望能及早有具體成果出來。 
 
二、與會心得與建議 
综合整個行程，筆者的心得如下： 
1. 科研教育的主管單位應研擬辦法積極支援學生出國參與國際會議，最好的方式是不管
學生有無投稿都有相對的補助讓優秀的學生有機會參加。今年我曾申請讓一位碩士班

到積極與主動的協助，畢竟教育是不限於課堂上的，我們的競爭力需要從新一代的的
學術人力培養起才有永續的優勢局面。 
2. 國內籌辦各種學術研討活動正方興未艾，如果能在國科會這類層級的單位下，成立專

1. Introduction 
Diamond coating on cemented tungsten carbides in machining tools are widely used to 
improve performance and service lives. The advantages include high surface hardness, low 
friction, high thermal conductivity, and better corrosion protection. These mechanical 
properties greatly promote a tool’s wear resistance [2]. The existence of cobalt binder in a 
cemented diamond carbide suppresses diamond growth during high temperature deposition 
and thus induces poor adhesion of the diamond coating. Various approaches have been 
reported to reduce the catalyst effect of cobalt on the growth of diamond films. Removing the 
cobalt binder from the substrate by acid etching is usually conducted to meet this end. Its 
drawback is the significant reduction of the substrate’s mechanical properties and toughness. 
In addition, the large residue stress will be raised due to the mismatch of thermal expansion. 
Diffusion barriers seem to be a better way to prevent the Co catalyst effect, but the adhesion 
of the diamond coating still needs to be improved. In this study, a chromium interlayer was 
coated on WC-Co substrates to improve the performance of diamond surface coatings by 
using a chromization process. Chromization by the hard chromization process, on alloys with 
carbon concentrations higher than 0.3 wt.%, is applied to achieve higher hardness [3-8] and 
good adhesion properties [8]. One of the authors has conducted a systematic investigation of 
the microstructures and mechanical properties of steels with different carbon contents [9].  
Investigation of these Cr-based interlayers between diamond film and WC-Co substrates was 
first reported by Polini, et al. [10]. In their study, chromium carbide formation on PVD film 
surfaces during the CVD process was also found beneficial to diamond adhesion. In our 
previous work [1], we studied and compared the formation of chromium carbide interlayers 
on tungsten carbides by hard chromization process and by PVD deposition. The hard 
chromized interlayer was identified to be a good candidate as a diffusion barrier at a greatly 
reduced cost. However, the formation and adhesion of a chromized interlayer, which strongly 
influences the performance of the diamond coating on WC-Co substrates, are still not clearly 
4 
 
The surface morphologies and cross sections of specimens with chromium interlayers 
and their later diamond-coated surfaces were examined by scanning electron microscopy 
(SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The crystal structures and phases of 
these specimens were identified by grazing incidence (1°) X-ray diffraction (XRD) and 
Raman spectroscopy at room temperature. The excitation wavelength of Raman spectroscopy 
is 532.14 nm. A scratch tester was used to conduct the scratch adhesion test of chromized 
interlayers. The adhesion strength is usually determined by two terms: the lower and the 
higher critical loads [12]. The lower critical load, LC1, was defined as the load where the first 
crack occurred (cohesive failure). The upper critical load, LC2, was defined as the load where 
the first delamination at the edge of the scratch tracks occurred (adhesion failure). To compare 
the adhesion strength of various chromized layers, LC2 was measured and investigated. Each 
LC2 value was obtained from ramping loads up to 196 N. The Daimler-Benz Rockwell-C 
(HRC-DB) adhesion test [13] was used to access the adhesion of chromium interlayers and 
their diamond coatings. The load of 1471 N was applied to cause damage to the coating 
adjacent to the boundary of the indentation. More than three scratch tests and indentations 
were conducted for each specimen. 
 
3. Results and Discussion 
3.1 Surface morphologies, microstructures, and critical loads of chromized interlayers 
Surface morphologies of WC-12 wt.% Co specimens chromized under various conditions 
are shown in Fig. 1. Granular structures with various grain boundaries are depicted on these 
surfaces even after chromization for only 2.25 h (chromization temperature: 850 ℃) in Fig. 
1a. The primary phase on the chromized surface is identified by XRD as chromium-iron 
nitride, (CrFe)2N(1-x), and the rest is chromium carbide, Cr23C6, identical to those in our 
previous study [1]. Among these chromized layers, cracks penetrated across the grains on the 
6 
 
were identified by XRD, as shown in Fig. 3. Two diamond peaks and minor chromium 
carbide peaks were detected. The peaks of chromium-iron nitride that were formed in the 
chromized interlayers [1] after the diamond deposition process were not found in this study. 
The quality of the CVD-diamond coatings was determined by the Raman spectra (Fig. 4). The 
peak intensities of the diamond (1337.7~1339.0 cm
-1
) and the graphite (1587.8~1589.7 cm
-1
) 
phases were compared. The diamond share of the diamond coating on the intermediate layer 
chromized at 850 ℃ for 2.25 h (Fig. 4a) was higher than that for 4h (Fig. 4b). An additional 
Raman spectrum of a WC substrate with 6.0 wt.% Co content coated with diamond on its 
chromized interlayer at 850 ℃ for 2.25 h is shown in Fig. 4c. The thickness of the interlayer 
was 1.67±0.03 m, which was nearly the same as that of the chromized interlayer on WC-12 
wt.% Co substrate under the same chromization process (refer to Fig. 2). The quality of the 
CVD-diamond remained the same as that shown in Fig. 4a, even though the cobalt content in 
the substrate was decreased from 12 wt.% to 6.0 wt.%. It is believed that the layers’ defects, 
i.e. the microcracks, rather than their thickness, are the major factor in the chromized 
interlayer’s performance as the diffusion barrier of cobalt binder.  
3.3 The Daimler-Benz Rockwell-C (HRC-DB) adhesion test 
The adhesion properties of diamond-coated WC-Co specimens were evaluated by 
HRC-DB adhesion test. The microstructures of indentation craters on specimens after the 
HRC-DB adhesion tests are shown in Figs. 5 and 6. In the specimen with an interlayer 
chromized at 950 ℃ for 4 h, deep and extensively distributed cracks surrounded the 
indentation crater, as observed in Fig. 5a. Figure 5b, the backscattered electrons (BSE) image 
of Fig. 5a, reveals that the surface of the WC-Co substrate was also exposed due to the rupture 
of the chromized interlayer. When the specimen was pre-coated with the chromized interlayer 
at 850 ℃ for 2.25 h, lateral spalls still appeared around the crater, as show in Fig. 6a. But the
