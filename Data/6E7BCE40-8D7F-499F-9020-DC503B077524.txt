The effects of MgO on nitrogen dissolution and p-type conduction of sol-gel Al-N codoped MgxZn1-xO films were investigated.
Substitution of MgO for ZnO significantly increased the solubility of nitrogen in the MgxZn1-xO films. The formation energies of NO
and (N2)O were found to decrease with increasing MgO content, resulting in higher concentrations of NO and (N2)O. The acceptor
levels of NO were estimated to be about 114 and 163 meV above the valence band maximum, respectively, for x = 0 and x = 0.05
films. The bandgap and the acceptor ionization energy increase with the MgO content, leading to a reduction in hole concentration and
an increase in resistivity. The homojunction formed between a Al-N codoped MgxZn1-xO and a n-type Ga0.01Zn0.99O film displayed
a typical rectifying behavior with a turn-on voltage of 2V, confirming the p-type conduction of the Al-N codoped MgxZn1-xO films.

Zinc oxide (ZnO) has been considered as an excellent material for
blue and UV light emitting diodes and laser diodes due to a bandgap
of 3.37 eV and a free exciton binding energy of 60 meV.1 High-quality
n-type ZnO can be achieved by doping group-III elements, such as
Al, Ga, and In. However, the realization of p-type ZnO is difficult
due to factors such as self-compensating defects, deep acceptor level,
and low solubility of acceptor dopants.2 Nitrogen is a good acceptor
for producing p-type ZnO due to atomic-size and electronic-structure
considerations.3 A method of co-doping of acceptors and reactive
donors was proposed to increase the solubility of nitrogen in ZnO.4
Many methods have been used to prepare doped ZnO films, such as
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), pulsed laser deposition (PLD), radio-
frequency magnetron sputtering (RFMS), and metal organic chemical
vapor deposition (MOCVD). In comparison with above methods, the
sol-gel method has distinct advantages such as simplicity, homogene-
ity, and cost effectiveness. Film composition can be controlled easily
by adjusting the ion proportions in the solution.5, 6 Recently, p-type
ZnO films prepared by a sol-gel method have been reported by Cao
et al. and Dutta et al.7, 8 Cao et al. obtained low-resistive p-type ZnO
using In-N co-doping.7 Dutta et al. reported that the p-type Al-N
codoped ZnO/n-type Si heterojunction possess the rectification be-
havior, which is a characteristic of a p-n junction.8
Further investigations of p-type ZnO films, such as wide bandgap
p-type MgxZn1-xO films prepared by mixing ZnO (Eg = 3.37 eV)
with MgO (Eg = 7.8 eV), are beneficial in quantum wells and UV
optoelectronic devices applications.9 Li et al.10 prepared p-type un-
doped MgxZn1-xO. Wei et al.11 fabricated p-type MgxZn1-xO by N
doping. Zhang et al.12 reported on the growth and properties of p-type
MgxZn1-xO by Al-N co-doping. Theoretical calculations predicted that
the solubility of the dopant was dependent on the formation energies
of the dopant-containing defects.13
However, the dopant effect on the formation of N-containing de-
fects in N-doped ZnO materials is controversial. N can be dissolved
into ZnO with two different chemical bonding states. One is NO,
which is the desired acceptor, and the other is (N2)O, which behaves
as a shallow double donor.7, 14–16 Yan et al.17 reported that the for-
mation energies of NO and (N2)O in N-doped ZnO were related to
the stoichiometry of ZnO. Furthermore, Gai et al.18 concluded that
the change of the formation energy for the NO in Mg0.25Zn0.75O was
strongly dependent on the number of Mg atoms that were nearest
neighbors to nitrogen. However, the effect of MgO substitution on
the formation of NO and (N2)O was not yet investigated, which is
important in fabricating p-type N-doped MgxZn1-xO.

To clarify this, we investigated the effects of MgO on N dissolution
and p-type conduction of sol-gel Al-N codoped MgxZn1-xO films. We
found that the substitution of MgO for ZnO increased the solubility
of NO and (N2)O in p-type Al-N codoped MgxZn1-xO films due to
the oxygen vacancies caused by the addition of MgO. In addition, we
also demonstrated that the NO acceptor levels lie at around 114 and
163 meV above the valence band maximum (VBM), respectively for
the p-type Al-N codoped ZnO and Mg0.05Zn0.95O films by a variable-
temperature Hall-effect measurement. Furthermore, the p-type behav-
ior of Al-N codoped MgxZn1-xO films was further demonstrated by
the appearance of a rectification I-V behavior after depositing the Al-
N codoped MgxZn1-xO films on n-type Ga0.01Zn0.99O (GZO) films/Si
substrates to form homojunctions.
Experimental
Al-N codoped MgxZn1-xO films prepared by a sol-gel method.—
The Al-N codoped MgxZn1-xO films were prepared on glass sub-
strates by a sol-gel method. Raw materials consist of zinc acetate
dehydrate (ZnCH3COO2 · 2H2O), magnesium chloride hexahydrate
(MgCl2 · 6H2O), aluminum nitrate (Al(NO3)3 · 9H2O), and ammo-
nium acetate (CH3COONH4). A sol was prepared after mixing thor-
oughly the above salts in isopropyl alcohol with diethylamine (DEA)
as a sol stabilizer on a magnetic stirrer. The atomic ratio of Zn/N/Al
was fixed at 1:1:0.01 and the concentration of Mg2+ was adjusted to
form Al-N codoped MgxZn1-xO films with x in the range 0.0–0.05. The
substrates were spin-coated with the sol at 2500 rpm for 15 second,
and then heated at 550◦ for 10 min in oxygen ambient. To build up
the films to 250 nm, the coating and heating processes were repeated
10 times.
The ZnO-based homojunction fabrication.— The GZO film was
deposited on Si substrate by radio frequency (rf) magnetron sputtering
using ZnO (purity 99.99%) mixed with 1 at.% Ga2O3 (purity 99.99%)
as the ceramic target. The Si substrate was cleaned by the usual semi-
conductor technology before loading into the chamber. The sputtering
was carried out under rf power of 45 W and working pressure 10 mTorr
at ambient temperature. The sputtering gas was 100% Ar atmosphere.
After sputtering, the GZO film was annealed at 300◦C for 20 min
under 5% H2 forming gas to improve the conductivities of the film.
A sol-gel p-type Al-N codoped MgxZn1-xO film annealed at 550 ◦C
was coated on the above GZO/Si substrates. To realize ZnO-based
homojunction, top and back indium (In) electrodes were made on the
p-type Al-N MgxZn1-xO and GZO film, respectively.
The crystalline structures of the Al-N codoped MgxZn1-xO films
were analyzed by x-ray diffraction (XRD) (PANalytical X’Pert Pro).

in the XPS spectra.14, 26 However, these characteristic signals are not
detected in the XPS spectra of the p-type Al-N codoped MgxZn1-xO
films. Therefore, the (NC)O and (NH)O defects are not considered in
our XPS studies. Perkins et al. showed that the presence of the 404.9
eV peak was produced by N2 molecules on the O sites.14 The (N2)Se
defects were also reported to be induced by heavy N doping in the
ZnSe films.27, 28
Figure 4a shows that the N 1s peak of the x = 0 film locates
at 396.4 eV, which is evidently attributed to the NO. The NO is an
acceptor which contributes to the observed p-type conductivity. For
the x = 0.025 film [Fig. 4b], the N 1s have two peaks, one locates
at 395.9 and the other at 404.5 eV, which represent NO and (N2)O,
respectively
.
The 404.5 eV peak, which is not present in the x = 0
film, appears when MgO is incorporated. The peak intensity of the NO
becomes stronger, in comparison with that of the x = 0 film, implying
that the NO concentration increases with the content of MgO. For
the x = 0.05 film, the intensities of the NO and (N2)O peaks are
much higher than those of the x = 0.025 film, as shown in Fig. 4c.
It indicates that dissolution of nitrogen into the ZnO lattice increases
with the MgO content. According to the first-principles calculations,
the chemical bonding states and the solubility of N in ZnO are related
to the stoichiometry of the ZnO.17 The formation energies of NO and
(N2)O in ZnO were found to decrease with the increase of the oxygen
vacancies. In a word, dissolution of nitrogen is enhanced under O-poor
condition.
Figures 4d-4f illustrate the O 1s core shells which can be decon-
volved into three peaks: 532.20, 531.25, and 530.15 eV, which sug-
gested the existence of three different environments of oxygens.29, 30
The highest energy peak is derived from the surface adsorbed oxygen
which is probably due to environmental moisture trapped in the film
surface. The other two peaks are associated with O2− in different bind-
ing structures. A peak at 531.25 eV is connected to O2− ions situated
at the oxygen deficient region in the ZnO, and a peak at 530.15 eV
originates from O2− ions surrounded by Zn ions with full complement.
The observed 531.25 and 530.15 eV peaks may be assigned to sim-
ilar O2− binding structures in the p-type Al-N codoped MgxZn1-xO
films. Among them, the x = 0.05 film possesses the weakest peak
(530.15 eV) and the strongest peak (531.25 eV), which implies that
the film exhibits the most oxygen-deficient region in all these films. It
represents that the oxygen vacancies increase with the increase of the
MgO content. The atomic ratio of O to Zn was also obtained by the
EDX measurement. The atomic ratio of O to Zn was found to decrease
from 0.943 to 0.704 when the MgO concentration increased from 0 to
0.05. This result agrees well with the observed XPS spectra of O 1s
core shells. The crystalline quality of the Al-N codoped MgxZn1-xO
films was observed to become poorer with the increase of the MgO
content, as shown in Fig. 1. It supports this argument. The increase
of oxygen vacancies with the MgO content may be due to the large
lattice mismatch and the difference in crystal structure between ZnO

coefficient and hν is photo energy.10, 12 The band gaps of the p-type
Al-N codoped MgxZn1-xO films were determined to be 3.26, 3.33, and
3.39 eV for x = 0, 0.025, and 0.05, respectively. It is clearly seen that
the band gap of the p-type Al-N codoped MgxZn1-xO films increases
with the content of MgO. Cao et al. reported that N doping decreased
the band gap of p-type N-doped ZnO films from 3.30 eV (ZnO film)
to 3.17 eV (ZnO:N film).7 In our study, the solubility of nitrogen in
the Al-N codoped MgxZn1-xO increases with the MgO content. Based
on our results, MgO seems to have a more significant effect on the
band gap change than N.
In order to understand the origin of p-type behavior with different
MgO content in the p-type Al-N codoped MgxZn1-xO films, a variable-
temperature Hall-effect measurement was performed for x = 0 and
x = 0.05 films, as shown in Fig. 7. It is well known that the relationship
between acceptor ionization energy (Ea) and hole concentration (np)
can be described as follows:
n p =

[3]
where NV is the hole effective density of states in the valence band,
NA acceptor impurity concentration, kb Boltzmann constant, and T
temperature. Due to NV ∝ T3/2, the Eq. 3 can be written as follows:
ln
(
n pT −

4
)
= − Ea
2kbT
+  [4]
where  is a constant. The ln(npT−3/4) is plotted as a function of
T−1 in Fig. 7. By fitting the plot with Eq. 4, the values of the acceptor
ionization energy related to NO in the p-type Al-N codoped MgxZn1-xO
films were estimated to be about 114 and 163 meV for x = 0 and
x = 0.05 films, respectively. The value of the acceptor ionization
energy increases with the MgO content. This is reasonable considering
that the incorporation of MgO significantly increases the band gap.
Similar deepening of acceptor level was also proposed in Li-doped
MgxZn1-xO.38
According to the results discussed above, the mechanism of p-type
conduction in the p-type Al-N codoped MgxZn1-xO films can be given
qualitatively as follows: N is likely to serve as an acceptor NO, which
contributes to the p-type conductivity. When MgO is incorporated into
ZnO, the hole concentration decreases and resistivity increases, indi-
cating that the electrons producing from (N2)O and oxygen vacancies
donors are more than the holes producing from NO acceptors due to
the substitution of MgO for ZnO. Moreover, substituting MgO for
ZnO shifts the VBM to a lower energy and increases the band gap,
which results in an increase in the ionization energy of the NO acceptor
and a reduction of the p-type carrier concentration. It is not favorable
for the realization of p-type conduction in the p-type Al-N codoped
MgxZn1-xO films. Our general understanding of substitutional NO ac-
ceptor in MgxZn1-xO films at relative MgO content is expected to be
applicable to other substitutional acceptor, such as Li, P, Sb and As.
The electrical properties of p-type Al-N codoped MgxZn1-xO films
obtained in our work are very stable, even after three months. To
further verify the p-type conduction in Al-N codoped MgxZn1-xO
films, ZnO-based homojunctions were fabricated as described above.
Figure 8a illustrated a schematic diagram of the ZnO-based homo-
junction. A 130 nm n-type GZO film with an electron concentration
of ∼1019 cm−3 was grown on a Si substrate by rf magnetron sputtering,
followed by deposition of a 250 nm Al-N codoped MgxZn1-xO film
(x = 0 or 0.05) with a hole concentration of ∼1016-17 cm−3. In-
dium electrodes were used to form Ohmic contacts on both the Al-N
codoped MgxZn1-xO and the n-type GZO films. Figure 8b shows that
the I-V curves of the homojunction exhibit a typical rectifying behav-
ior. The turn-on voltage of junctions is about 2 V under the forward
bias at room temperature, which is smaller than the bandgap of ZnO
(3.37 eV). The value is also smaller than those previously reported
for p-n ZnO homojunctions.39 This is reasonable because it is hard to
prepare p-type N-doped ZnO with high hole concentration. The effect
of poor crystallinity caused by N doping cannot be ignored.7 N doping
in ZnO layers induces defects such as oxygen vacancies, which may
result in a low concentration of holes. It was also reported that the
p-type N-doped ZnO/n-type ZnO homojunctions with turn-on voltage
of 1.5–1.9 eV.7, 40 During I-V measurements, no luminescence was
detected from the junctions under the forward bias at room tempera-
ture. It is due to low mobility of the p-type ZnO and the nonradiative
recombination from defects in the interface of the junction.41, 42 The
linear I-V dependencies as shown in Fig. 8c and 8d exhibit that In/Al-
N codoped MgxZn1-xO films (x = 0 or 0.05) and In/GZO films are
Ohmic contacts. These results confirm that the rectifying behavior
shown in Fig. 8b is due to the ZnO-based homojunction. This rec-
tification behavior verifies the p-type conductivity of Al-N codoped
MgxZn1-xO films.
The ideality factor n was obtained from the slope of the ln I versus
V plot [Fig. 8e] using the following equation:43
n = q
kbT
dV
dln I
[5]
The ideality factor of the p-type Al-N codoped Mg0.05Zn0.95O/n-type
GZO homojunction was found to be 4.2, which is unexpectedly high.
High ideality factors have also been observed in other nonideal wide
band gap p-n junctions.41 It may be attributed to space-charge-limited
conduction, deep-level-assisted tunneling, or parasitic rectifying junc-
tions within the device.44 Such I-V characteristics are similar to those
reported for p-n heterojunctions.45, 46
Conclusions
In conclusion, we investigated the effects of MgO incorporation
on dissolution behavior of N and p-type conduction in Al-N codoped
MgxZn1-xO films in details. The films with different MgO content
were characterized by their structural (XRD), morphology (SEM),
optical (Transmission spectra), electrical (Variable-temperature Hall-
effect measurement) and compositional (XPS, EDX, and Raman spec-
tra) properties. The results indicated that the substitution of MgO for
ZnO increased the solubility of nitrogen in p-type Al-N codoped
MgxZn1-xO films. The decreasing formation energies of NO and (N2)O
with increasing MgO content are due to the enhanced oxygen vacan-
cies caused by the addition of MgO. Moreover, the substitution of
MgO for ZnO shifts the VBM to a lower energy and increases the
band gap, which results in an increase in the ionization energy of
the NO acceptor and a reduction of the p-type carrier concentration.
The ZnO-based p-n homojunctions are also prepared and a typical
rectifying behavior with a turn-on voltage of 2V in the I-V curves
is observed, which verifies the p-type conductivity of Al-N codoped
MgxZn1-xO films.

energies of the two Gaussian peaks at 396 and 404 eV represent NO and
(N2)O, respectively. The presence of the two N 1s peaks indicates the
successful incorporation of N into the Al-N codoped Mg0.05Zn0.95O
films. The NO acceptor is bonded to Zn atoms and is usually observed
(the peaks at approximately 396–397 eV in the XPS spectra) in heavily
N-doped ZnO.18–20 It is close to the binding energy of the N-Zn bond in
Zn3N2, 395.8 eV.21 The slight difference in local environments causes
the shift of the NO binding energy. When a N2 molecule occupies an
O site, i.e. (N2)O, it releases two electrons. In the analysis of defect
transition levels and wave functions, Lee et al. also confirmed that
(N2)O acted as a shallow double donor which was very similar to the
(N2)Se molecule at a Se site in ZnSe.16 Perkins et al. indicated that
the presence of the 404.9 eV peak was produced by N2 molecules
on the O sites.18 Similar analysis of N 1s binding energy was also
investigated in N-doped TiO2 and SnO2, respectively.22, 23 XPS can
provide a quantitative evaluation of the elemental composition of the
films. The integral intensity of NO and (N2)O is calculated according
to XPS spectra and is shown in Fig. 2b as a function of N content. It

can be seen that the integral intensity of NO increases with increasing
N doping, but then decreases at high levels of N doping. The integral
intensity of (N2)O is in direct proportion to N doping.
Based on first principle calculations, Limpijumnong et al. pre-
dicted that excess nitrogens tended to form low-energy substitutional
diatomic molecules on the O sites.15 Li et al. indicated that the trans-
formation from nitrogen acceptor NO to undesirable (N2)O donor oc-
curred in high temperature annealing process.24 The instability of the
NO acceptors makes their local chemical environment unstable which
introduces additional bonding energy for the NO acceptor. In our case,
the concentrations of NO and (N2)O increase with increasing N doping
at low N doping level. However, at the high N doping levels, the con-
centration of NO decreases drastically, and the concentration of (N2)O
continues increasing. It is believed that some NO acceptors combine
easily with N-related defects to form double donors (N2)O at high N
doping levels. The defect chemical reactions for the dissolution of
nitrogen in ZnO are described as follows:
Ni + OO → (NO)O [1]
(NO)O + NO → (N2)O + OO [2]
Since excess N interstitial atoms (Ni) have very high formation
energies, they tend to bind with the closest OO to form (NO)O. (NO)O
is unstable in the presence of NO, therefore, the (N2)O may be formed
because of the strong N-N bond. In addition, reaction 2 reduces the
number of defects. The formation of (N2)O from NO and (NO)O is
expected, especially in high N content levels. Reaction 2 also results
in lower concentration of NO which agrees well with the observed
XPS spectra of N 1s core shell. The (N2)Se defects were also reported
in ZnSe films with heavy N doping.25, 26

where  is a constant. Figure 4b shows ln(npT−3/4) plotting as a
function of T−1. By fitting the plot with Eq. 5, the values of the
acceptor ionization energy are estimated to be approximately 177
and 163 meV for X = 0.5 and X = 1.0 films, respectively. It is
noted that the concentration of NO acceptor in X = 1.0 film is much
greater than that of the X = 0.5 film from XPS spectra of N 1s core
shell [Fig. 2]. The value of the acceptor ionization energy decreases,
which is attributed to the increasing concentration of NO acceptor.
The NO acceptor creates an additional impurity band right above the
valance band maximum (VBM), resulting in an upward shift of the
VBM and a reduction in the bandgap. The electron transition occurs
between the NO acceptor levels and the impurity band, rather than the
valence band, which reduces the ionization energy of the acceptor. The
impurity band makes ionization energy of the acceptor decrease. This
is also reported in Ga-N or P-N codoped ZnO by the first-principles
calculations.32, 33
To confirm the analytical results discussed above, the bandgap of
the Al-N codoped Mg0.05Zn0.95O films was determined using optical
transmission spectra. As shown in Fig. 4c, the bandgap is evaluated
by plotting (αhν)2 vs. hν, where α is the absorption coefficient and hν
is photon energy. The bandgaps of the Al-N codoped Mg0.05Zn0.95O
films are determined to be 3.41 and 3.39 eV for X = 0.5 and 1.0,
respectively. The bandgap of the Al-N codoped Mg0.05Zn0.95O films
decreases with the N content, which is attributed to the merge of
impurity band above the VBM.
Conclusions
In conclusion, p-type Al-N codoped Mg0.05Zn0.95O films with dif-
ferent N content were prepared on glass substrates by a sol-gel method.
A significant difference in the variation of NO and (N2)O was observed
with the N level in the Al-N codoped Mg0.05Zn0.95O films. At low N
doping levels, N mainly substituted the O site to form the NO accep-
tor, which contributed to the p-type conductivity. The NO acceptor
levels locate at approximately 177 and 163 meV for X = 0.5 and X
= 1.0 films, respectively. The value of the acceptor ionization energy
decreases with increasing N content, which is attributed to an addi-
tional impurity band right above the VBM. The combination of NO
acceptors with other N-related defects to form double donors (N2)O at
high N doping levels results in lower concentration of NO and a n-type
conduction. There exists an optimal N content for p-type conduction
in Al-N codoped Mg0.05Zn0.95O films.

it is still hard to prepare reproducible p-type N-doped ZnO
with high carrier concentration, low resistivity and high
mobility. The changes in chemical bonding states and com-
plex defects of N dopants play a very important role in the
stability of p-type ZnO:N. To obtain reproducible results,
ZnO materials need to be characterized carefully and thor-
oughly. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a sensi-
tive method of characterizing the local arrangement of
atoms in materials, providing element information about
chemistry, site occupancy and neighboring chemical envi-
ronment. XPS is able to designate various complicated
N-related complex defects in N-doped ZnO, such as substi-
tutional N atoms and N2 molecules on O sites (NO and
(N2)O), N–H and N–C complex defects [15,18]. The bind-
ing energies of these defects cover a wide range from 395
to 405 eV. To solve the diﬃculty of reproducible p-type
N-doped ZnO, it is essential to study the chemical bonding
states and the thermal stabilities of N-related complex
defects in ZnO:N ﬁlms. More importantly, it is a key factor
for success with high-temperature operations of ZnO-based
optoelectronic devices.
This paper investigates the p-type conducting properties
of sol–gel Al–N codoped ZnO ﬁlms and the eﬀect of
annealing temperatures on the formation of N-related
complex defects. The results provide direct evidence that
the chemical bonding states and the solubility of N-related
complex defects in ZnO:N ﬁlms are highly sensitive to
annealing temperatures. Among defects, only NO can act
as acceptors and contribute to p-type characteristics of
the annealed ZnO:N ﬁlms. In addition, it is demonstrated
that the NO acceptor levels lie at 114 meV above the
valance band maximum (VBM) for the p-type Al–N
codoped ZnO by a variable-temperature Hall-eﬀect
measurement.
Moreover, one-dimensional nanostructured materials
such as ZnO nanorod array (ZNA) for potential optoelec-
tronic devices [19–21] have attracted much attention, owing
to their large surface area, high crystalline quality and
quantum conﬁnement eﬀect. In addition, the carrier injec-
tion eﬃciency of nanosized junctions could be increased
because the carrier injection rate signiﬁcantly increases at
nano-contacts in Schottky diodes [22,23]. Therefore,
researchers have been trying to make ZNA-related p–n
junction devices. Owing to the diﬃculty of reproducible
growth of controllable, stable and high-quality p-type
ZnO, most ZNA-related p–n junction devices have been
realized by growing ZNA on other p-type materials such
as GaN [24–26], Si [27], CuAlO2 [28], NiO [29] and organic
compounds [30–32]. Generally, p–n heterojunction devices
show lower eﬃciency than homojunction devices [33,34],
because an energy barrier forming at the junction interface
decreases carrier injection eﬃciency for a heterojunction
with a large band oﬀset [35]. Few ZNA-related p–n homo-
junctions have been reported [36,37], owing to the diﬃcult
fabrication of nanostructured ZnO homojunction.
In pursuit of the next-generation nanodevices, the
present authors fabricated a hybrid structure with nano-
structured ZnO homojunctions by spin-coating the investi-
gated p-type Al–N codoped ZnO ﬁlm on an n-type ZNA.
The ZNA was grown hydrothermally on Ga0.01Zn0.99O
(GZO)/silicon (Si) substrates. Compared with ﬁlm-based
ZnO homojunctions, the prepared nanostructured ZnO
homojunctions possessed high interfacial contact area
and low leakage current. The results demonstrate possible
application of ZnO-based nanostructures as optoelectronic
devices.
2. Experimental details
2.1. Al–N codoped ZnO ﬁlms prepared by the sol–gel method
The Al–N codoped ZnO ﬁlms were prepared on glass
substrates by a sol–gel method. Raw materials consisted
of zinc acetate dehydrate, aluminum nitrate and ammonium
acetate. A sol was prepared after mixing the above salts
thoroughly in isopropyl alcohol with diethyl amine as a
sol stabilizer on a magnetic stirrer. The atomic ratio of
Zn/N/Al was ﬁxed at 1:1:0.01. The substrates were spin-
coated with the sol at 2500 rpm for 15 s, and then heated
at temperatures ranging from 450 to 650 C for 10 min in
oxygen ambient. To build up the ﬁlms to 250 nm, the coat-
ing and heating processes were repeated 10 times.
2.2. Nanostructured ZnO homojunction fabrication
Fig. 1a–e presents a schematic diagram representing
hybrid-structure devices with nanostructured ZnO homo-
junctions prepared in this study. Hybrid nanostructured
homojunctions were prepared by growing ZNA on GZO
seed layer/Si substrates, followed by spin-coating p-type
Al–N codoped ZnO ﬁlm sequentially on ZNA.
The GZO ﬁlm was deposited on Si substrate by radio
frequency (r.f.) magnetron sputtering using ZnO (purity
99.99%) mixed with 1 at.% Ga2O3 (purity 99.99%) as the
ceramic target. The Si substrate was cleaned by the usual
semiconductor technology before loading into the cham-
ber. The sputtering of GZO was carried out under 45 W
r.f. power and 10 mtorr working pressure at ambient tem-
perature. The sputtering gas was 100% Ar atmosphere.
After sputtering, the GZO ﬁlm was annealed at 300 C
for 20 min under 5% H2 forming gas to improve the con-
ductivities of the ﬁlm.
For the growth of ZNA, zinc nitrate hexahydrate and
hexamethylenetetramine were individually added to deion-
ized water to form two 0.01 M precursor solutions. These
two precursor solutions were then mixed together in a glass
bottle. The glass bottle with a substrate was then sealed
and maintained at 75 C for 2 h in order to grow ZNA.
After the growth of ZNA, the sample was removed from
the mixed solutions, rinsed with distilled water and dried
at room temperature.
The sol–gel p-type Al–N codoped ZnO ﬁlm annealed at
550 C was coated on the above ZNA-containing sub-
strates. To realize the hybrid nanostructured ZnO

for the sample annealed at 550 C. Among the group V
acceptor candidates (e.g., N, As, P and Sb), N has the shal-
lowest acceptor level [8], and its ionic radius is similar to
that of oxygen, therefore it substitutes for O (NO) and acts
as an acceptor. Experimental studies have determined that
the acceptor levels lie at 180, 145 and 200 meV above the
VBM for P- [38], As- [39] and Sb-doped ZnO [40], respec-
tively. Compared with these group V elements, NO pos-
sesses the shallowest acceptor level in ZnO.
3.1.2. Chemical bonding states of N, C and O determined by
XPS
XPS is a sensitive and powerful method of yielding com-
prehensive information about elemental content and chem-
ical bonding states, which allows clariﬁcation of the origin
of p-type behavior: its realization and compensation–
suppression. The N 1s XPS spectra for the 450, 550 and
650 C annealed samples are shown in Fig. 3a. High-reso-
lution XPS reveals two distinct forms of nitrogen. One is
NO acceptor, which is formed by the substitution of N
atom for O site, and the other is (NC)O donor, which is
produced by substitution of N atom and C impurity
together for O site. The binding energy of NO and (NC)O
in N-doped ZnO is located at 396.5 and 399 eV, respec-
tively [15,18]. XPS can provide a quantitative evaluation
of the elemental composition of the ﬁlms through deter-
mining peak integral intensities of species. The integral
intensities of NO and (NC)O were calculated according to
XPS spectra (Fig. 3a) and are shown in Fig. 3b as a func-
tion of annealing temperature. For the sample annealed at
450 C, large numbers of NO and (NC)O species are formed
in the Al–N codoped ZnO ﬁlm. (NC)O is known as a shal-
low donor in ZnO. It provides considerable electrons to
compensate the NO acceptor, resulting in n-type conduc-
tion. At a higher annealing temperature (550 C), (NC)O
donors decrease signiﬁcantly as a result of carbon burnout,
with little change in the concentration of the NO acceptors.
The sample exhibits p-type conduction. At a much higher
annealing temperature (650 C), NO acceptors combine
together and escape as N2 gas, which results in a lower con-
centration of NO acceptors. Fons et al. [41] found that two
NO acceptors form compensatory nitrogen molecules (N2)
in ZnO in a high-temperature annealing process based on
ﬁrst-principles calculations. Soudi et al. [42] observed the
N-related complex defects (N2 molecules) in ZnO nano-
wires. It is believed that NO acceptors combine easily to
form double donor N2 molecules and escape in the high-
temperature annealing process, which agrees well with the
observed N 1s XPS spectra in this work. The carrier type
changes from p to n conduction again, because the NO
acceptors decrease signiﬁcantly, even though the (NC)O
donors keep decreasing from 550 C to 650 C annealing.
The C 1s XPS spectra for the 450, 550 and 650 C
annealed samples are shown in Fig. 3c. The C 1s peak con-
sists of three contributions [18,43,44]. The highest energy
peak at 288 eV is derived from the surface adsorbed C–O
bond, which is possibly due to environmental air trapped
on the ﬁlm surface. This peak becomes lower and disap-
pears in ﬁlms with higher annealing temperatures, because
heat changes the surface state so that less C–O bond
adsorbs on the surface. The other two peaks are associated
with C-related complex defects in diﬀerent binding struc-
tures. The peak at 285.6 eV is due to the C–N bond, and
the peak at 284.6 eV is ascribed to the C–C bond from car-
bon clusters. The relative decrease in C–N peak with
increasing annealing temperature indicates that C–N com-
plex defects have been eﬃciently suppressed by increasing
annealing temperature. It also agrees well with the
observed N 1s XPS spectra (Fig. 3a). All the samples con-
tain a signiﬁcant number of unintentional C–C bonds from
carbon clusters. Chen et al. indicated that undesired carbon
clusters in N-doped ZnO may act as donors or compensa-
tion centers for holes [16]. However, Tang et al. reported

shown in Fig. 4a. Fig. 4b shows a typical polycrystalline
diﬀraction pattern for the sample annealed at 550 C. The
lattice constant (3.33 A˚) calculated from the ﬁrst diﬀraction
ring matches that of graphite (111) (3.34 A˚) (JCPDS card
No. 75-2078). No wurtzite structured lattice parameter of
ZnO is around this value. This directly indicates that
carbon clusters exist in graphite state. The carbon clusters
in ZnO also manifest themselves by the presence of D and
G vibrational modes in the Raman spectra, which are
attributed to the presence of carbon sp2 clusters [16]. Gen-
erally, carbon clusters (graphite) have excellent conductiv-
ity and cause a non-uniform distribution of conductivity in
the sample. This may be a big obstacle for the realization of
high quality p-type ZnO derived from organic precursors.
Fig. 4c presents the XRD patterns of the Al–N codoped
ZnO ﬁlms annealed at diﬀerent temperatures. It suggests
that the ﬁlms possess a polycrystalline phase wurtzite struc-
ture with a preferred orientation along the c axis. The
improvement in the degree of crystallinity with increasing
annealing temperatures is also observed from the increas-
ing intensity of the (002) peak. Moreover, the diﬀraction
angle of (002) peaks shift to higher angles with annealing
temperatures, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4c. Owing to
the substitution of the larger N atom or NC diatomic mol-
ecule for the smaller O site, NO and (NC)O species will
cause the lattice constants to expand and lead to a lower
diﬀraction angle of the (002) diﬀraction peak. According
to the observed N 1s XPS spectra (Fig. 3a), the sample with
an annealing temperature of 450 C possesses large num-
bers of NO and (NC)O species, which could shift the

of the band gap of ZnO, namely the recombination of free
excitons through an exciton–exciton collision process [49].
No other peaks were detected except the 371 nm one. This
demonstrates that ZNA grown on the GZO/Si substrates
in this investigation possess excellent quality.
HRTEM was used to further characterize the lattice
structure of the ZNA. The HRTEM images are shown in
Fig. 8, which are typical images of ZNA grown on the
GZO/Si substrates. Lattice fringes with spacing of
0.26 nm observed correspond to the (002) lattice planes.
The HRTEM image (Fig. 8a) and the selected-area electron
diﬀraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 8b) reveal that the wurtz-
ite ZNA is single crystalline in nature. The perpendicular
direction of the (002) planes matches the ZNA growth
direction, implying that [002] is the rod growing direction,
which is consistent with the XRD results.
To complete the hybrid-structure device with nanostruc-
tured ZnO homojunctions, the p-type Al–N codoped ZnO
ﬁlm was spin-coated on the ZNA and annealed at 550 C
for 10 min in oxygen ambient. The coating and the anneal-
ing processes were repeated 10 times. The top view of the
FESEM image of the hybrid-structure device is shown in
Fig. 9a. The nanostructured homojunction has a large
interfacial contact area because the p-type Al–N codoped
ZnO ﬁlm covers the n-type ZNA thoroughly. The FESEM
image in Fig. 9b shows a cross-sectional view of the hybrid-
structure device. The thickness of the p-type Al–N codoped
ZnO ﬁlm coating on the n-type ZNA is 200 nm. Most
recently, some research groups reported p–n junctions
between p-type ZnO ﬁlm and ZNA. However, the p-type
ZnO ﬁlm was not deposited over the whole surface, but
rather only on top of each ZnO nanorod [36,37]. The fab-
ricated p–n homojunctions in the ZnO nanostructures exhi-
bit larger interfacial contact area. The sol–gel p-type ZnO
ﬁlm covers the whole surface of the n-type ZNA. The
extended interface areas available on the whole surface of
the hybrid-structure device enhance the eﬀective absorbing
area for photovoltaic applications [21].
For comparison, a ﬁlm-based ZnO homojunction was
also fabricated by spin-coating sol–gel p-type Al–N cod-
oped ZnO ﬁlm directly on sputtered n-type GZO ﬁlm.
The I–V characteristics of the nanostructured and the
ﬁlm-based ZnO homojunction are shown in Fig. 10a. The
I–V curves clearly show a non-linear increase in current
under the forward bias. The leakage current of the nano-
structured ZnO homojunction is 0.80  106 A, which
is smaller by a factor of 2 than that of the ﬁlm-based
ZnO homojunction at the reverse bias of 5 V. In addition,
in the case of the nanostructured ZnO homojunction, the
current increases abruptly when the applied voltage
exceeds 1.6 V, which is smaller than the turn-on voltage
of 2.0 V of the ﬁlm-based ZnO homojunction. The current
abruptly increasing at the applied voltage of 10 V of the
nanostructured homojunction is 1.5 times larger than that
of the ﬁlm-based ZnO homojunction. The diﬀerent I–V
behaviors can be explained by energy-band structures at
the homojunction interfaces, that is, the interface between
the n-ZNA and the p-ZnO ﬁlm for the nanostructured
ZnO homojunction and that between the n-GZO ﬁlm
and p-ZnO ﬁlm for the ﬁlm-based ZnO homojunction.

additional excess charges appear in the conduction band,
which is responsible for a sudden increase in currents
[52]. The conduction becomes SCL current conduction,
and the current follows a dependence of I  9leV2/8d3
(I  V2). Similar transport phenomena were also observed
by Das et al. in p-type ZnO nanowires/n-type Si hetero-
junctions [53]. They observed Ohmic current ﬂow for for-
ward bias of 0.8 V and I  V2 for V > 4 V.
These results demonstrate the eﬀective p-type conductiv-
ity of the Al–N codoped ZnO ﬁlm after fabricating on the
n-type ZNA. It is suggested that the p-ZnO ﬁlm/n-ZNA
structure with high interfacial contact area and low leakage
current can be applied as a versatile p–n optoelectronic
device.
4. Conclusions
In summary, the thermal stability of p-type Al–N cod-
oped ZnO ﬁlms was investigated in detail. The structural
(XRD, TEM), morphology (SEM, AFM), optical (trans-
mission spectra), electrical (variable-temperature Hall-
eﬀect measurement) and compositional (XPS) properties
of the ﬁlms annealed at diﬀerent temperatures were charac-
terized. The results provide direct evidence that the thermal
stabilities and chemical bonding states of N-related com-
plex defects in ZnO:N ﬁlms are highly sensitive to anneal-
ing temperature. Among defects, only NO can act as
acceptors and contribute to p-type characteristics of the
annealed ZnO:N ﬁlms. The existence of a suitable temper-
ature window for the appearance of p-type Al–N codoped
ZnO ﬁlm is demonstrated. In addition, a hybrid structure
with nanostructured homojunctions composed of p-type
Al–N codoped ZnO ﬁlm/n-type ZNA is conﬁrmed to pos-
sess excellent rectiﬁcation characteristics. More impor-
tantly, compared with those of the ﬁlm-based ZnO
homojunction, the nanostructured ZnO homojunction
exhibits high interfacial contact area and low leakage cur-
rent. These results reveal a possible application of ZnO-
based nanostructures as optoelectronic devices.

the formation of corrugated ZnO nanorods.24 Wang et al.
reported the cubic ZnMgO/hexagonal ZnMgO interlayer/ZnO
nucleating layer heterostructure NPGs under the presence of
MgO.25 After deliberating these reported models which could all
be classified as adsorbing chemical species onto either Zn-polar
(0001) or O-polar (0001¯) planes, we found that this model is not
suitable for our work because Ga is uniformly substituted for Zn
atom in the entire NPG under doping condition. Therefore, we
proposed a new growth model, which is based on the change of
surface energy as calculated by computer simulation due to Ga
doping, to interpret the transformation from the lateral planes
{11¯00} of smooth nanorods to two sets of facets: ({112¯1}, {112¯2¯})
and ({2¯201}, {1¯101¯}) of corrugated NPGs. Finally, we report the
remarkable FE properties of the GZO NPGs under various
growth conditions.
2 Experimental
2.1 Deposition of GZO seed layer
The GZO seed layer was deposited on Si (100) substrates by
radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering at room tempera-
ture using a 1%GZO target. The sputtering power was kept at 45
W; working pressure was 10mTorr; sputtering gas was 100% Ar;
and the deposition time was 1 h. The seed layer was 200 nm
thick with a wurtzite (0002) preferred orientation measured by
SEM and XRD. The Hall properties of the GZO seed layer were
measured. Its carrier concentration is 7.86 6 1019 cm23,
mobility 50.04 cm2 V21 s21, and resistivity 1.59 6 1023 V cm.
The GZO seed layer is excellent to serve as back electrodes for
further optoelectronic devices measurements and applications.
2.2 Growth of GZO nanostructures
The GZO nanostructure arrays were then fabricated on the pre-
deposited GZO seed layer via MOCVD. Zinc acetylacetonate
hydrate [Zn(acac)2?xH2O] (Aldrich, powder), oxygen gas, and
gallium acetylacetonate [Ga(acac)3] (Aldrich, 99.99%) were
used as the Zn, O, and Ga doping sources. Nitrogen was
introduced as the precursor carrier gas. Zn(acac)2?xH2O and
Ga(acac)3 powders were placed together in an outer glass
vessel. The whole fabrication process was kept at a reaction
horizontal quartz furnace from 450 to 850 uC; and the outer
vessel was heated to 135 uC. The Zn(acac)2?xH2O and Ga(acac)3
started to evaporate after their temperatures were higher than
about 112 and 130 uC, respectively. The O2 and N2 flow rates
were kept at 300 and 500 sccm respectively; working pressure
was maintained at 3–4 mTorr by a mechanical pump; and the
reaction time was 5 min to 1 h. The effect of Ga contents was
investigated by varying the Ga/Zn molar ratios in the precursor
as 0.041, 0.102, 0.410, 0.614, and 0.819.
2.3 Characterization of GZO nanostructures
The cross-section and surface morphologies of as-prepared
nanostructures were examined by a field emission scanning
electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV
(FESEM, JEOL6500). The phases of GZO NPGs arrays were
analyzed by either grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD,
PANalytical X’Pert Pro (MRD)) or gonio scan X-ray diffraction
(XRD, Shimadzu XRD6000) techniques with the Cu Ka
radiation. The chemical composition of GZO NPGs was
analyzed by Auger electron nanoscope with an accelerating
voltage of 10 kV (AES, ULVAC-PHI700). The GZO NPGs were
observed by a high resolution scanning transmission electron
microscope (HR-STEM, JEM2100F) or by an analytical trans-
mission electron microscope (AEM, JEM2010) at an accelerat-
ing voltage of 200 kV. The cross-section TEM samples were
prepared with a focused ion beam (FIB, FEI Nova200)
instrument. Low-temperature cathodoluminescence (CL) spec-
troscopy was performed at 10 K with a field emission scanning
electron microscope (JSM7001F).
2.4 Electrical measurements of GZO and ZnO nanostructures
To determine the electrical conductivities of GZO and ZnO
nanostructures, three-terminal single nanowire field effect
transistor devices were fabricated as followed. As-grown GZO
NPGs (Ga/Zn precursor ratio = 0.410) and pure ZnO NWs (both
were grown at 750 uC for 1 h) were transferred onto heavily
doped p+ Si substrates with a 300 nm thick SiO2 film on the
top. The heavily doped p+ Si substrate can serve as the back-
gate electrode for further device characterization in the three
terminal single nanowire field effect transistors. The source
and drain Pt electrodes were subsequently made at the two
ends of a single GZO NPG as well as a single ZnO NW with the
aid of a FIB apparatus. The I–V characteristics of the three-
terminal single nanowire field effect transistor devices were
performed by a semiconductor analyzer (Agilent B1500A)
under ambient condition at room temperature. Field emission
properties of GZO NPGs arrays were measured by an
electrometer in a vacuum chamber (,5 6 1026 Torr) at room
temperature (FE, Keithely-2410). The distance between the
anode and the emitting surface was in a range about 20–70 mm
and the diameter of anode was 1 mm.
2.5 Computational simulation
The surface energies of GZO were simulated according to an ab
initio method with the CASTEP plane-wave code. First, a 26 2
6 2 ZnO wurtzite supercell was built. The lattice parameters
were set as a = 6.499 Å, b = 6.499 Å, c = 10.411 Å, a = 90u, b =
90u, c = 120u. Second, representative (112¯0), (11¯00), (112¯1),
(112¯2), (1¯101), and (2¯201) plane slabs were created in vacuum,
in which some Zn atoms were replaced by Ga (e.g. two Zn
atoms were replaced by Ga atoms in order to have a doping
contents equivalent to 4.2%). Third, the density functional
theory (DFT) was treated with exchange-correlation and
Perdew-Ultrasoft pseudo-potentials; the self-consistent field
(SCF) tolerance threshold was set as 1026 eV at21 for the
structural convergence and 0.05 Å21 for the Monkhorst–Pack
k-point grid separation, respectively.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 The effects of the growth temperature on GZO
nanostructures
There were no apparent 1D nanostructures observed at 450 uC
and 550 uC. Fig. 1 shows the SEM images of GZO nanos-

essentially perpendicular to seed layers. The FWHMs of GZO
NPGs grown at 650, 750, and 850 uC are 0.35, 0.24, and 0.25u,
respectively, indicating that the GZO NPGs fabricated at higher
temperatures possessed better crystalline quality. In addition,
the integrated intensity of the ZnO (0002) diffraction peak
increased with the growth temperature of the GZO NPGs
(Fig. 2(b)), which demonstrates that the total amount as well as
the crystalline quality of GZO NPGs increases with tempera-
ture. Fig. 2(b) also demonstrates that the diffraction angle of
the (0002) peak shifts to higher angles, exhibiting the decrease
of lattice parameter c with the growth temperature. It is
attributed to the smaller Ga3+ ions (47 pm) substitution for
larger Zn2+ ions (60 pm).26 This observation suggests that the
doped Ga concentration increases with the growth tempera-
ture under the same Ga/Zn precursor ratio.
3.2 The effects of the Ga/Zn molar ratios on GZO
nanostructures
Since the doping of Ga is an important factor affecting the
shape of the GZO nanostructures, it is beneficial to study the
effect of the Ga concentration on the growth of GZO
nanostructures. Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of the GZO
nanostructures growing at 750 uC for 1 h with different Ga/Zn
precursor ratios. The SEM images show that the pagoda shape
of GZO nanostructures started to develop at a Ga/Zn precursor
ratio higher than 0.102. When Ga/Zn precursor ratio is lower
than this value, the shape of GZO nanostructures is the same
as pure ZnO nanostructures; however, when the Ga/Zn
precursor ratio is higher than this value, the shape of the
pagoda does not change significantly. It suggests that there is
a critical doping concentration for the pagoda shape to
develop. Some geometry features of GZO nanostructures were
calculated from SEM images and summarized in Table 1. No
significant change was found in the base diameters with the
Ga/Zn precursor ratios, while the densities of GZO nanos-
tructures increased slightly with the Ga doping. The tip widths
and the apex angles of GZO nanostructures almost remained
unchanged with the Ga doping, indicating that the radial
growth rate of GZO nanostructures was not affected by the Ga
doping. In contrast, the axial growth rate was influenced by the
Ga doping as was observed and revealed below. The average
lengths of GZO nanostructures demonstrated that the growth
rate of GZO nanostructures decreased substantially with the
increasing Ga concentration. The Ga contents of the GZO
nanostructures were determined by Auger electron spectro-
scopy and were listed in Table 1. Fig. 3(g) shows a typical Auger
electron spectrum (AES) of one GZO nanostructure growing at
750 uC for 1 h. The signals at 516, 995, and 1068 eV are
assigned to Auger transition of O KL2L2, Zn L2M4,5M4,5, and Ga
L3M4,5M4,5, respectively.
27 The incorporated Ga contents in the
GZO nanostructures increases abruptly initially, and then
increases linearly with the Ga/Zn precursor ratios. It indicates
that the incorporation of Ga in the GZO nanostructures
becomes harder at higher Ga doping.
To emphasize more on the top GZO nanostructures rather
than the bottom seed layer and substrates, we applied GIXRD
to reveal the crystal structures of the GZO nanostructures.
Fig. 4(a) shows the GIXRD patterns obtained from Fig. 3
performed under a 0.5u grazing angle. All GIXRD patterns
show an intensive, sharp (0002) diffraction peak of ZnO at ca.
34.52u along with several very weak diffractions. It corresponds
to the almost vertical growth of (0002) GZO nanostructures
with only slight tilt. The peak intensity decreased noticeably
with the Ga doping. To be precise, the integrated intensity of
the (0002) peak was plotted versus the Ga/Zn precursor ratios
in Fig. 4(b), demonstrating the decrease of the integrated
intensity with the increase of the Ga/Zn precursor ratios. Since
the integrated intensity and the average lengths of the GZO

118.39u and 136.49u, respectively. The exposed facet (green
line) can be indexed as {1¯101¯}.
Fig. 6(b) shows the TEM image of an individual GZO
nanorod growing for 10 min. The inset is the corresponding
SAED patterns with a [11¯00] zone axis. The lateral surface of
the GZO nanorod exhibits a gradually tapered shape. The
lateral exposed facet can be indexed as {112¯1} and {112¯2¯}. The
HR-TEM image taken from the region marked by the white
rectangle demonstrates that the lateral surface of the GZO
nanorod becomes more corrugated and rougher. The direc-
tions of the exposed facets can be determined either from the
angles between the basal and the exposed facets or from the
electron diffraction spots. The two exposed facets have
developed to long {112¯1} and short {112¯2¯} facets. The angle
between the long exposed {112¯1} facet (yellow line) and the
basal (0002¯) facet is about 73u, which is very close to the
theoretical 72.67u. Similarly, the angles between the short
exposed {112¯2¯} facet (pink line) with the basal (0002¯) facet and
with the {112¯1} facet are measured to be 122u and 131u,
respectively; they are very close to the theoretical angles
121.96u and 130.71u, respectively.
The exposed facets identified in this 10 min sample are
{112¯1} and {112¯2¯} facets. In contrast, the exposed facets
indexed for the 5 min sample are {2¯201} and {1¯101¯}. The
{112¯1} facet and the {2¯201} facet in each set of the exposed
facets have an angle of 17.33u and 15.12u with the (0002) axial
direction, respectively; they are very close to the measured
angle between the lateral surface and the central axis of these
cone-like GZO nanorods, about 15.6u as reported in Fig. 5(b).
The orientations of these two sets of exposed facets have a
30u-shift from each other, which corresponds to the observed
29.4u angle shift between two hexagonal sections mentioned in
Fig. 5(d). Based on the observation, the exposed long and short
facets of GZO NPGs should contain ({112¯1}, {112¯2¯}) facets as
well as ({2¯201}, {1¯101¯}) facets simultaneously.
All samples growing for longer than 30 min show similar
characteristics so that only the sample growing for 1 h is
shown in Fig. 6(c). The inset in Fig. 6(c) is the corresponding
SAED pattern with a [11¯00] zone axis. The lateral surface
exhibits a much more well-defined pagoda-like contour
comparing with those short time samples. The lateral exposed
facets are also determined as {112¯1}, {112¯2¯}. The HR-TEM
image taken from the region marked by the white rectangle
exhibits the exposed facets of the NPG more clearly. The lattice
spacings of several planes in the HR-TEM image are measured
as 0.26, 0.16, and 0.14 nm, which agree well with the values for
(0002), (112¯0), and (112¯2) crystal planes, respectively.
The spatial relations between GZO NPGs and GZO seed layer
are important for revealing the growth behavior. They were
investigated by cross-section TEM images with the aid of
focused ion spatial beam (FIB) apparatus, the results are
shown in Fig. 7. The relations are concluded as below:
[11¯00]GZO, NPGsI[11¯00]GZO, film
(0002)GZO, NPGsI(0002)GZO, film
and
[11¯00]GZO, filmI[110]Si
(0002)GZO, filmI(002)Si
The orientation of the GZO thin film is (0002). At the GZO–Si
interface, Si (002) is parallel to GZO (0002) with inter-planar
spacings of 0.2774 and 0.2668 nm, respectively. The lattice
mismatch is only about 3.9%. In contrast, in the directions of
GZO [11¯00] and Si [110], the inter-planar spacings are 0.2874
and 0.3842 nm, respectively. The lattice mismatch is as large
as 33.6%. The lattice mismatch of the growth plane (in-plane)

CrystEngComm Paper
Based on experimental results, the formation of GZO NPGs
using MOCVD was activated by the doping of Ga in ZnO. Since
the specific lateral ({112¯1}/{112¯2¯}) and/or ({2¯201}/{1¯101¯})
planes of the NPGs were transformed from the {11¯00} of the
nanorods in the later stages of growth, it was speculated that
these specific planes possessed lower surface energies due to
Ga doping. The surface energies of the {11¯00} and {112¯0}
planes were reported to be lower than those of the ({112¯1}/
{112¯2¯}) and ({2¯201}/{1¯101¯}) planes in pure ZnO materials;
however, no surface energies of GZO had been reported
previously.29–35 Herein, the influence of Ga doping on surface
energies of the corresponding planes was carried out by
simulation with a computational DFT protocol.
3.4 Computational simulation of surface energies of GZO
nanostructures
For the simulation of each surface, we use a slab composed of
a multiple unit cells and empty space. The two boundaries of
the slab facing empty space are the target surfaces. The (112¯0)
surface plane of the visual 3D wurtzite supercell is shown in
Fig. 9(a), in which two Zn atoms are replaced by Ga (equivalent
to 4.2% Ga doping). The thickness of the surface box is set at
6.38 Å, the vacuum orientation is along the c-axial and the
thickness is defined as 15 Å. It is sufficiently wide to render
negligible the effect of the potential of the opposite surface.
The geometries were optimized in both calculations. The
surface energy, Es, can be estimated by using:
29
Es~
1
2
| Eslab{Ebulkð Þ (1)
where Eslab is the total energy of the ZnO slab and Ebulk is the
total energy of bulk ZnO composed of the same number of
atoms. The visual 2D top view of the other (11¯00), (112¯1),
(112¯2), (1¯101), (2¯201) slab surfaces are also shown in Fig. 9(b)–
(f). The computationally calculated Zn–O and Ga–O bond
lengths before and after Ga doping in the relaxation super-
lattices are listed in Table 2. In the pure ZnO superlattice, Zn
atoms have a tetrahedral coordination with a computed Zn–O
bond length of 1.992 Å. In the GZO superlattice, the computed
Ga–O bond lengths are shortened to a range from 1.775 to
1.961 Å. This is also consistent to the shifting of XRD
diffraction angle of the (0002) peak to higher angle when Ga
is doped into ZnO.
Table 3 lists the results of computationally calculated
surface energies of six crystal planes before and after Ga
doping in the ZnO superlattice. We found both terms of Eslab
and Ebulk increased after the Ga doping. Whereas, the relative
difference in these two terms causes the final simulated
surface energies of {11¯00} and {112¯0} nonpolar surface planes,
which usually appear as lateral surfaces of wurtzite-type ZnO
nanostructures, to exhibit an increase of +2.92 and +2.51%,
respectively, after 4.2% Ga doping. The increasing surface free

Fig. 10(d), the turn-on field is also determined to be about
0.37, 0.39, 0.42, and 0.54, accordingly, for Ga/Zn precursor
ratios = 0.041, 0.102, 0.614, and 0.819 growing at 750 uC for 1
h. The turn-on field is insensitive to the contents of Ga doping.
Based on calculations from the slopes of the ln(J/E2) versus 1/
E plot at high applied electric field shown in Fig. 10(c), the
field enhancement factors b are calculated to be 304, 319,
1958, and 942, respectively, for pure ZnO NWs and GZO
nanostructures with a Ga/Zn precursor ratio = 0.410 growing at
650, 750, 850 uC for 1 h. In Fig. 10(e), the b values are
calculated to be 2126, 5483, 1458, and 1182 for GZO NPGs with
Ga/Zn precursor ratios = 0.041, 0.102, 0.614, and 0.819 growing
at 750 uC for 1 h. These FE characteristics of each condition
were summarized in Table 4. In comparison with pure ZnO
NWs, the b factor of GZO NPGs (Ga/Zn precursor ratio = 0.102,
750 uC) increases by about 18 times. This b factor of GZO NPGs
is better than most of the works reported previously for ZnO
nanostructures.2,13,14,20,22,38–43
The FE ability strongly depends on various factors: (i) work
function, (ii) emission area, (iii) crystal quality, (iv) electrical
conductivity, and (v) geometry shape as well as density of
emitter materials.38,44 The emission area and the crystal
quality effect can be ruled out because both of pure ZnO
NWs and GZO NPGs possess similar nanostructured array area
and excellent crystal quality with few defects. The turn-on
fields of GZO NPGs are lower than that of the ZnO NWs by
about 0.4–0.5 V. It was reported that a 5% doping of Ga
lowered the work function of ZnO by about 0.4 eV. Therefore,
the lowering of turn-on field caused by Ga doping can be
attributed mainly to the decrease of the work function, and
partly to the increase of the electrical conductivity.37,44,45
The electrical conductivities were calculated from the
source-drain current (Ids) versus drain bias voltage (Vds) curves
under zero gate voltage (Vg = 0 V) measured from fabricated
three terminal single nanowire field effect transistors. The
obtained electrical conductivities are 4.049 V21 cm21 and
12.658 V21 cm21 for single ZnO NW and single GZO NPG,
respectively. These values are comparable with previous
reports.46

synthesized interesting GZO nanopagodas (NPGs) which
possess two sets ({1121}/{1122} and {2201}/{1101}) of lateral
planes. In contrast, pure ZnO nanowires (NWs) exhibit {1100}
and {1120} planes. For the pursuit of next generation nano-
devices, it is benecial to comprehend the opto-electrical
properties and chemical reactivity of these unusual planes. In
this study, we report these characteristic properties, which
strongly depend on the type of crystal planes, of the GZO NPGs
and ZnO NWs.
2 Experimental
2.1 Deposition of the GZO seed layer
The GZO seed layer was deposited on Si (100) substrates by
radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering at room tempera-
ture using a 1% GZO target. The silicon substrates were cleaned
by a method usually used in semiconductor technology before
loading into the chamber. The sputtering power was kept at
45 W; working pressure was 10 mTorr; sputtering gas was 100%
Ar; and the deposition time was 1 h. Moreover, the GZO seed
layer was characterized by Hall measurements. Its carrier
concentration was 8.96  1019 cm3, mobility 68.75 cm2 V1
s1, and resistivity 6.54 104 U cm. The GZO seed layer was an
excellent candidate for use as a back electrode in further opto-
electronic device measurements and applications.
2.2 Growth of GZO nanostructures
The GZO nanostructures were then fabricated on the pre-
deposited GZO seed layer via MOCVD. Zinc acetylacetonate
[Zn(acac)2] (Aldrich, powder), oxygen gas, and gallium acetyla-
cetonate [Ga(acac)3] (Aldrich, 99.99%) were used as the Zn, O,
and Ga sources. Nitrogen was introduced as the precursor
carrier gas. Zn(acac)2 and Ga(acac)3 mixed powders were placed
in an outer glass vessel. The whole fabrication process was
carried out in a horizontal quartz furnace at 750 C; the outer
precursor vessel was heated at 135 C; O2 ow rate was 300
sccm; N2 ow rate was 500 sccm; the working pressure was
maintained at 3–4 Torr using a mechanical pump; and the
reaction time was 1 h. For GZO nanostructures, the Ga/Zn
precursor molar ratios were controlled to be 0.105, 0.419, 0.629,
and 0.838. The Ga contents determined by Auger electron
spectroscopy ranged from 2.3 to 9.6%, and are listed in Table 1.
Pure ZnO nanostructures were also prepared by the same
procedure without Ga doping.
2.3 Characterization of GZO nanostructures
The surface morphologies of as-prepared nanostructures were
examined by a eld emission scanning electronmicroscope with
an accelerating voltage of 15 kV (FESEM, JEOL-6500). The
chemical composition and binding states of ZnO and GZO
nanostructures were investigated by an Auger electron nano-
scopewith an accelerating voltage of 10 kV (AES, ULVAC-PHI700)
and by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI-1600). The
crystal structures of ZnO andGZO nanostructures were observed
by a high resolution scanning transmission electronmicroscope
(HR-STEM, JEM2100F) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.
2.4 Electrical transport properties measured by three-
terminal SWFET devices
ZnO and GZO SWFETs were fabricated by directly transferring
the ZnO NWs and GZO NPGs onto designed patterns of Au
(150 nm)/Ti (50 nm) electrodes, which were fabricated on
heavily doped p+ Si substrates with a 300 nm thick thermally
grown SiO2 layer on the top using standard lithographic
methods. Individual NW or NPG was then connected to the Au/
Ti patterns by depositing platinum using a dual-beam focused
ion beam instrument (FIB, FEI Nova 200). The electrical trans-
port properties of as-fabricated ZnO as well as GZO SWFET
devices were investigated using a semiconductor analyzer
(Agilent B1500A) under ambient conditions at room
temperature.
2.5 Opto-electrical response of two-terminal UV PD devices
The photoresponse properties of two-terminal metal–semi-
conductor–metal (MSM) structured UV PDs composed of GZO
NPGs and ZnO NWs were measured using a semiconductor
analyzer (Agilent B1500A) and a 254 nmUV lamp under ambient
conditions at room temperature.
2.6 Photocatalytic activity of GZO and ZnO nanostructure
arrays
The UV photocatalytic activity of 1D GZO NPG and ZnO NW
arrays as well as the 2D GZO lm was evaluated using rhoda-
mine B (RhB) as a representative dye. For each condition, the
ZnO-based catalyst array was immersed into a 2 ppm RhB
solution with magnetic stirring in the dark for 30 min to
ensure adsorption/desorption equilibrium of RhB with the
catalyst. The whole photocatalytic reaction took place under a

Fig. 2(c) shows the sweeping Ids–Vg curves for various Vds,
indicating that the devices operate in a depletion (normally ON)
mode. To extract the eld-eﬀect electron mobility, we used the
cylinder-on-plate model to estimate the gate capacitance
coupling between the GZO NPG and the back-gate oxide as
follows:41
Cox ¼ 2p303oxL
cosh1

rþ tox
r

where 30 ¼ 8.85  1014 F cm1 is the vacuum dielectric
constant; 3ox¼ 3.9 is the relative dielectric constant for SiO2; r¼
0.105 and L¼ 2.371 mm are the channel radius and the length of
the GZO NPG; and tox¼ 300 nm is the thickness of the back-gate
dielectric. Given the above parameters, the estimated gate
capacitance was Cox ¼ 2.54  1016 F. The eld-eﬀect electron
mobility could be extracted from Ids–Vg curves using the trans-
conductance (gm) at a xed drain bias Vds as follows:
m ¼ gm  L
2
CoxVds
Using the maximum transconductance extracted from Ids–Vg
curves, the electron mobility was calculated to be 74.57 cm2 V1
s1 (in the case of Vds ¼ 3 V). The carrier concentration (ne) was
then estimated from42
ne ¼ 1
rem
where the resistivity r ¼ 0.079 U cm and e ¼ 1.6  1019 C. The
carrier concentration is calculated to be 1.06  1018 cm3. This
value is comparable to that (1017 to 1019 cm3) measured on
doped ZnO NWs in previous works.43,44
The channels of all GZO SWFET samples were not fully
pinched oﬀ when negative Vg was applied till 20 V. This
shows that the threshold voltage should be much higher than
20 V. The transconductance and mobility obtained above
might be over-estimated, while the carrier concentration might
be under-estimated. The same phenomena were also observed
in GZO NWs reported by Yuan et al.42 The weak conductance
responses to Vg in ZnO nanorods were also reported by
Park et al.41 Indeed, the Ga doping increases the conductivity
of ZnO.
3.3 Opto-electrical properties of ZnO NWs and GZO NPGs
ZnO NWs exhibit highly susceptible opto-electrical properties
during UV illumination due to the wide direct energy band gap
(3.37 eV) and large surface-to-volume ratio. Two-terminal UV
PDs were fabricated by depositing indium tin oxide (ITO) lms
directly on top of the chosen GZO NPGs and the ZnO NWs. The
top ITO conducting electrodes were deposited using an oblique-
angle sputter technique. This technique provides a simple
method to fabricate a large area top electrode for vertically
aligned NWs.45,46 The schematic diagram of the ZnO and the
GZO UV PDs is illustrated in Fig. 3(a). Fig. 3(b) shows the linear
I–V characteristic of the GZO (Ga/Zn precursor ratio ¼ 0.105)
and the ZnO UV PDs both in the dark (yellow and green curves)
and under 254 nm UV illumination (red and blue curves) in
ambient conditions at room temperature. The change in the
photocurrent intensity is attributed to the variation of the
amount of conduction carriers.
Fig. 3(c) shows the response of the photocurrent subjected to
repetitive UV light switching with cycling times between 0 and
240 s under an applied bias of 1 V. The photocurrent increases
rapidly upon UV exposure, stays roughly constant during UV
exposure, and then returns to the pre-exposure value when UV
exposure ends. The GZO PD (Ga/Zn precursor ratio ¼ 0.105)
exhibits relatively larger photocurrent (133.8 mA), about 5 times,
than the ZnO PD (34.9 mA). The rise time, dened as the time
taken for the photocurrent to reach 90% of its maximum value,
is roughly 0.53 and 1.15 s for GZO and ZnO PDs, respectively.
The decay time, which is dened as the time taken for the
photocurrent to decrease to 10% of its maximum value, is
roughly 14.00 and 16.13 s for GZO and ZnO PDs, respectively. To
quantify the photoresponse of PDs, we dened the photo-
response factor (S) as
S ¼ IUV  Idark
Idark
The calculated S is about 0.3 and 2.1 for GZO and ZnO PDs,
respectively. The photoresponse factor of ZnO PD is comparable
to the literature values. The calculated S is moderate for the
GZO PD. It is attributed to the relatively high dark current
caused by the high conductance of the GZO NPGs and the
presence of an ohmic contact (as shown in Fig. 2) without a

1 V are summarized in Table 3. The photo/dark currents of GZO
PDs increase rapidly with increasing Ga contents, and reach a
maximum value at Ga/Zn precursor ratio¼ 0.419. Increasing Ga
contents raise the electron concentration and enhance the
electrical conductance. The photo and dark currents decrease
when more Ga was doped into ZnO. It is partly due to the
Burstein–Moss eﬀect in the high electron carrier concentration
regime, and partly due to the formation of complex defects at
high Ga contents. The same phenomena were also reported by
Ghosh and Basak.21 and Yang et al.25 The photoresponse factor
(S) is the highest for the GZO PDs with a Ga/Zn precursor ratio¼
0.838. It is clearly seen that the dark current of this sample is the
smallest. The change of these properties can be interpreted
easily by the electronic eﬀect, and is thus probably dominated
by the eﬀect of Ga content.
In dark ambient conditions, it is generally accepted that
oxygen (O2) and water vapor (H2O) molecules adsorb on the
surface of ZnO-based nanostructures by capturing free electrons
and holes from n-type ZnO and creating a depletion layer with
low conductivity near the surface:
O2 + 2e
/ O2
(ad) (1)
2H2O + 4e
/ H2 + 2OH
 (2)
H2O + 4h
+/ ½O2 + 2H
+ (3)
It leads to a lower current before UV illumination. Upon UV
illumination with photon energies higher than the ZnO band
gap, a large number of photogenerated electron–hole pairs are
created:
hn/ e + h+ (4)
The electron–hole pairs in the nanostructures are separated
by strong local electric elds, which greatly reduce the electron–
hole recombination rate and increase the carrier lifetime.
Photogenerated holes migrate to the surface and take part in
discharging the adsorbed oxygen ions to form photon-desorbed
oxygen which eliminates the depletion region:
O2
(ad) + 2h+/ O2 (5)
The readsorption process occurs simultaneously with the
desorption process until it comes to an equilibrium state.
Consequently, the electrons in the conduction band build up
gradually until desorption and readsorption of O2 reach an
equilibrium state. As a result, there is a gradual rise of current
and increase of conductivity until saturation during UV illu-
mination.12,28,48,49 The participative reactions (1)–(5) which are
associated with gas molecules and electron–hole pairs in PD are
schematically expressed in Fig. 4(a).
When the UV light is switched oﬀ, the two stages in the
photocurrent decay process can be attributed to the recombi-
nation of the excess holes and electrons which immediately
reduces the conductivity. Meanwhile, the readsorption of O2
and H2O molecules on the ZnO-based nanostructure surface
would create a depletion region and further reduce the
conductivity. Fig. 3(d) shows the time-resolved relaxation of the
photocurrent under an applied bias of 1 V. Aer a steady state
was established with the UV light “ON”, the shutter was closed.
The photocurrent followed a second-order exponential decay,
which could be tted by an exponential curve:
I ¼ I0 þ A1 exp

 t
s1

þ A2 exp

 t
s2

The tted time constants are s1 ¼ 1.50 s, s2 ¼ 28.36 s for the
GZO PD (Ga/Zn precursor ratio ¼ 0.105) and s1 ¼ 3.40 s, s2 ¼
32.92 s for the ZnO PD. The presence of two decay time
constants represents two diﬀerent relaxation mechanisms: The
rst faster stage with time constant s1 can be ascribed to
recombination of excess holes and electrons, which reduces the
conductivity immediately. The smaller s1¼ 1.50 s of the GZO PD
than the s1 ¼ 3.40 s of the ZnO PD is due to the better
conductivity and a faster electron–hole recombination rate of
the GZO NPGs. The rise time under UV illumination is also
associated with s1.
The second slower stage with time constant s2 is connected
with the adsorption of O2 and H2O molecules. O2 molecules
capture only free electrons from n-type ZnO to form adsorbed
oxygen ions, while H2O molecules which can capture both
electrons and holes in ZnO shorten the photoresponse more
eﬀectively. Besides, H2O molecules are more eﬀective in taking
up O2 vacancies in ZnO than O2 molecules due to their single
bonding, while the O2 molecules have double bonding.12,48–50
Based on tted results, we found that the s2¼ 28.34 s of the GZO
PD is faster than the s2 ¼ 32.92 s of the ZnO PD. The s2 domi-
nates the whole photocurrent decay process in comparison
with the s1. That is why the observed decay time in the GZO PD
(14.00 s) is faster than that of the ZnO PD (16.13 s).
3.4 Photocatalytic activity of ZnO NWs and GZO NPGs
To probe the photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared ZnO NWs
and GZO NPGs for degradation of RhB, the investigation was
performed in the presence of UV light radiation. The UV-vis

UV PDs and (b) photocatalysis.

NWs and GZO NPGs with diﬀerent Ga/Zn precursor ratios.
Under UV irradiation, the time points at which 10% concen-
tration of RhB remained are 120, 90, 105, 135, and 150 min,
respectively, for samples with Ga/Zn precursor ratios ¼ 0, 0.105,
0.419, 0.629, and 0.838. The photocatalytic activity of GZO NPGs
with Ga/Zn precursor ratios ¼ 0.105 and 0.419 is better than
that of the ZnO NWs. When the Ga/Zn precursor ratio increases
further, the photocatalytic activity of GZO NPGs was observed to
decrease.
PDs involve solid–gas interfacial reaction processes which
produce resistance changes in the 1D semiconductor matrix.
Similarly, photocatalysis of organic dyes also involves solid–
liquid interfacial oxidation–reduction processes driven by
photogenerated electron–hole pairs. The increasing electron
carriers due to Ga doping facilitate more O2 and H2O molecules
to chemisorb onto the surfaces of NPGs (reaction (1) and (2)),
which generate more oxygen and hydroxyl radicals (reaction (6)
and (7)) to attack RhB molecules.
In addition, these phenomena also depend on the chemi-
sorption reactivity of the surface exposed planes. To verify this,
the chemisorption reactivity of the various planes was charac-
terized by XPS.
3.5 Chemisorption reactivity of ZnO NW and GZO NPG
crystal planes
To obtain chemical absorption ability of ZnO NWs and GZO
NPGs, XPS analyses were carried out. Fig. 6 shows the XPS
spectra of ZnO NWs and one of the representative GZO NPGs
(Ga/Zn precursor ratio ¼ 0.105). Both ZnO NWs and GZO NPGs
have a core-level peak at 1021.3 eV, which represents Zn 2p3/2 in
the Zn–O bond (shown in Fig. 6(a)). Fig. 6(b) shows a core-level
Ga 2p3/2 peak at 1117.6 eV for the GZO NPGs but none for the
ZnO NWs. Fig. 6(c) and (d) show the O 1s spectra of the ZnO
NWs and the GZO NPGs, respectively. The O 1s spectra are
asymmetrical and possess a visible shoulder. The asymmetric O
1s peaks can be decomposed into two components centered at
about 529.8 eV (Ob) and 531.2 eV (Oad) aer being tted with the
Gaussian function.37,51 The full width at half maximum (FWHM)
is equal to about 2.355s, where s is standard deviation. The O 1s
peaks do not contain the component (Ov, 530.3 eV) which
associates with O2 ions in oxygen-decient regions. The
absence of the Ov component is consistent with the results of
the HR-TEM images shown in Fig. 1 and low temperature (10 K)
cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy in one of our previous
works. The CL spectra of the GZO NPGs and the ZnO NWs
exhibit only the pure near-band-edge peak, which is attributed
to both free exciton emission and neutral donor bound excita-
tion. The CL spectra contain no deep-level emission peak which
is associated with defective regions like oxygen vacancies and
zinc interstitials. It demonstrated that the nanostructures are
perfect crystalline quality.
The Ob peak on the low binding energy side of the O 1s
spectrum is attributed to the Zn–O bonds, while the Oad peak of
higher binding energy is attributed to chemisorbed or dissoci-
ated oxygen or OH species, such as adsorbed O2 or H2O on the
surface. The O2 and H2O chemisorption reactivity on diﬀerent
exposed crystal planes of ZnO-based nanostructures can be
estimated by the intensity of the Oad component (shown in
Table 4). The binding energies of Ob and Oad of the GZONPGs in
the case of Ga/Zn precursor ratio ¼ 0.105 (529.85  0.60 and
531.22  0.75 eV) are only slightly higher than those of the ZnO

energies. In contrast, the {1010} and {1120} planes are nonpolar
surfaces composed of equivalent Zn2+ and O2 ions which
exhibit the lowest surface energies. The polar Zn2+-terminated
planes (GZO NPGs) are more facile to adsorb O2 and H2O than
the nonpolar surfaces (ZnO NWs).
Herein, both PD and photocatalytic reactions were driven by
photogenerated electron–hole pairs. It is commonly accepted
that O2 and H2O molecules adsorb onto the surfaces of ZnO-
based nanostructures, creating depletion regions as we
described above. A large number of photogenerated electrons
and holes migrate to the surfaces where they participate in
redox reactions with the absorbed O2 and H2O, which conse-
quently form oxygen _O2
 and hydroxyl _OH radicals. They are
extremely strong oxidants for the mineralization of RhB. Since
both ZnO and GZO adsorb oxygen or water on their surfaces,
GZO is considered as operating via the same degradation
mechanism of RhB as pure ZnO.
Types of lateral surfaces also aﬀect the adsorption of O2 and
H2O on the surfaces of ZnO and GZO nanostructures. The
{1121}, {1122}, {2201}, and {1101} planes in GZO NPGs exhibit
better O2 and H2O chemisorption reactivity than the {1010} and
{1120} planes in ZnO NWs. More O2 and H2O chemisorbed onto
ZnO-based nanostructures and more photogenerated electron–
hole pairs produce more oxygen _O2
 and hydroxyl _OH radicals
to attack the RhB dye molecules. Furthermore, better electrical
conductance facilitates more O2 and H2O molecules to chemi-
sorb onto the surfaces of NPGs.
Although the lateral surface area decreases with the Ga/Zn
precursor ratio, the amount of Oad exhibits an initial increase
and then a subsequent decrease. The sample with the best
photocatalytic activity is the one with a Ga/Zn precursor ratio ¼
0.105, which corresponds to the one with the highest Oad
amount. The Oad amount does not exhibit a monotonic varia-
tion with the Ga contents, and the photocatalytic activity
essentially matches the trend of the Oad amount. It is reason-
able to conclude that the photocatalytic activity depends more
on the polar surfaces of the ZnO-based nanostructures than the
electronic eﬀect. The improved photocatalytic activity of GZO
NPGs is attributed to the enhanced O2 and H2O chemisorption
reactivity of the {1121}, {1122}, {2201}, and {1101} planes rela-
tive to the {1010} and {1120} planes in the ZnO NWs. Therefore,
GZO NPGs demonstrated better chemisorption reactivity than
ZnO NWs.
4 Conclusions
ZnO nanostructures with Ga doping prepared by MOCVD
developed an interesting NPG shape with exposed {1121},
{1122}, {2201}, and {1101} lateral planes instead of the {1010}
and {1120} planes in the ZnO nanorods or NWs. The opto-
electrical properties and chemical reactivity of the GZO NPGs
and ZnO NWs were studied in this investigation. UV responses
of PDs demonstrated that GZO NPGs possessed a faster elec-
tron–hole generation and recombination rate than ZnO NWs. In
addition, the GZO NPGs exhibited higher photocatalytic activi-
ties than the ZnO NWs. The improved photocatalytic activity of
GZO NPGs is attributed to the exposure of the {1121}, {1122},
{2201}, and {1101} planes. Due to the higher surface energies
and the presence of the Zn2+-terminated polar state, the {1121},
{1122}, {2201}, and {1101} planes exhibited enhanced O2 and
H2O chemisorption reactivity.

ZnO-based p-n coaxial homojunction diodes were fabricated by metal–organic chemical vapor deposition 
(MOCVD) technique. N-type Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) nanopagodas (NPGs) cores were grown on GZO 
seed layers first, and then p-type Ag-doped ZnO (SZO) shells were deposited sequentially on the GZO 
NPGs. The entire one dimensional (1D) p-n SZO-GZO and SZO-ZnO coaxial nanostructures exhibit 
better diode characteristics, such as lower threshold voltage, better rectiﬁcation ratio, and better ideality 10 
factor n, than what were reported for either 2D or 2D-1D p-n heterojunction and/or homojunction diodes. 
It is partly due to the presence of homojunctions instead of heterojunctions, and partly due to the 
increased area of nanosized junctions and the better crystal qualities of both the p and n 1D nanostructure. 
The binding energies of Ga and Ag were determined to be about 56 and 127 meV, respectively, by low-
temperature and temperature-dependent photoluminescence. In comparison, SZO-GZO coaxial p-n 15 
homojunctions display better diode properties than the SZO-ZnO ones. 
1. Introduction 
Zinc oxide, a II–VI n-type semiconductor with a direct 
energy gap of 3.37 eV and a large exciton binding energy of 60 
meV,1 is a good candidate material to substitute silicon for the 20 
pursuit of the next generation electronic and photonic devices. 
Many efforts had been devoted to develop ZnO nanostructures 
for various applications such as laser diodes,1,2 light-emitting 
diodes,3,4 solar cells,5 field effect transistors,6,7 field emitter,8 
photodetectors,9,10 and photocatalysts.9 Among them, diodes and 25 
light-emitting diodes attracted global interests recently due to the 
energy saving and environmental issues. 
ZnO is an intrinsic n-type material due to its native defects 
like oxygen vacancies and zinc interstitials. The fabrication of 
reproducible p-type ZnO is relatively difficult. Hence, most of the 30 
ZnO-based diodes and light-emitting diodes used GaN,4,11 
polymer,12,13 Si,14 graphene,15 CuAlO2,
16 and CuAlCN17 as p-type 
materials. However, as heterojunction devices, they exhibited 
lower efficiencies than homojunction devices due to the energy 
barriers formed at the junction interfaces, which decreased the 35 
carrier injection efficiency with a large band offset.4 
Much progress has been made in ZnO-based p-n 
homojunction devices recently. The most studied p-type dopants 
in ZnO were group-VA elements: N, P, As, and Sb,18-23 as well as 
group-IA elements: Li, Na, and K.24-26 They were theoretically 40 
predicted to be shallow acceptors. Some rarely reported p-type 
dopants include group-IB elements, such as Cu, Ag, and Au.27-29 
Volnianska et. al. reported that Ag was expected to be an 
efficient p-type acceptor in ZnO while Cu and Au possessed 
deeper levers and thus were less effective. The formation energy 45 
of Ag in favorable O-rich conditions (~0.85 eV) and the 
ionization energy of Ag (~0.4 eV) predicted by GGA+U 
calculation are relatively lower than those for Cu and Au.30 
Furthermore, one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures such as 
wires, rods, tubes, rings, belts, needles, and pagodas are 50 
fascinating materials due to their unique properties like high 
aspect ratio and high surface area.31 Diodes and light-emitting 
diodes devices with high injection current and quantum effect 
light emission could be obtained using nanosized junctions 
formed by crossing p- and n-type nanowires.11 Two-dimensional 55 
(2D) thin film ZnO-based p-n homojunctions generally exhibit 
fair crystal qualities, non-single crystalline and small junction 
areas. Although commercial high quality ZnO substrates are 
available, they are very expensive. To maximize the junction 
areas and to improve the crystal qualities of the nanosized 60 
junctions, employment of entire 1D ZnO nanostructures with p-n 
homojunctions is one of the ideal structures. 
In this study, we synthesized entire 1D ZnO-based p-n 
homojunction diodes with a p-type Ag doped ZnO (SZO) 
nanostructures shell covered on an n-type Ga doped ZnO (GZO) 65 
nanopagodas (NPGs) by a metal–organic chemical vapor 
deposition (MOCVD) technique. Entire 1D ZnO-based p-n 
homojunction diodes or light-emitting diodes were focused on 
using the group VA20-23 and group IA24 for the p-type dopants, 
whereas the use of group IB as p-type dopants has not been 70 
reported yet. The fabricated SZO nanowires (NWs) were 
characterized by low-temperature photoluminescence and 
electrical current-voltage (I-V) measurements, demonstrating that 
SZO possessed prominent p-type behavior. Finally, the influence 
of Ga contents on the performances of p-n SZO-GZO coaxial 75

Ga3+ ions (0.47 ), Zn2+ ions (0.60 ), and Ag+ ions (1.00 ).33 
The mismatchs between ionic radii were about -21.6 and 66.7% 
for the substitution of Ga and Ag for Zn, respectively. Fig. 1(c) 
shows the SEM image of the SZO-GZO coaxial core-shell 
nanostructures. Noticeably, the corrugated pagoda shape of the 5 
GZO NPG core almost disappeared when they were covered by 
SZO shells. The SZO-GZO coaxial nanostructures lengthened 
and coarsened as compared with GZO NPGs, indicating that the 
SZO-GZO coaxial nanostructures grew not only along the fastest 
axial c-axis but also along the radial directions. 10 
To characterize the top 1D nanostructure rather than the 
bottom seed layer and substrate, GIXRD was employed to reveal 
the crystal structures of the 1D nanostructure. Fig. 1(d) shows the 
GIXRD patterns carried out under a 0.5 °  grazing angle for 
nanostructure samples. All GIXRD patterns show an intensive, 15 
sharp (0002) diffraction peak of ZnO at ca. 34.52° accompanying 
with two very weak diffractions, i.e. 36.32° (1011) and 47.52° 
(1012). It indicates that the ZnO NWs, GZO NPGs, SZO NWs, 
as well as SZO-GZO coaxial nanostructures are almost vertical to 
the substrates with only a slight tilt. The peak intensity decreases 20 
noticeably with the Ga or Ag doping. The integrated intensities of 
the (0002) peak of the ZnO NWs, GZO NPGs, SZO NWs, and 
SZO-GZO coaxial nanostructures are plotted in Fig. 1(e), 
demonstrating that the integrated intensity decreases rapidly with 
the doping of either Ga or Ag. The integrated intensity of the 25 
SZO-GZO coaxial nanostructures is slightly higher than that of 
the GZO NPGs because the SZO-GZO coaxial nanostructure 
possesses higher volume of ZnO due to the two-step deposition. 
The full width at half maximum (FWHM) are 0.45, 0.45, and 
0.47° for ZnO NWs, GZO NPGs, and SZO NWs, respectively, 30 
indicating that their crystal qualities are similar. Since the 
diameters and densities of the GZO NPGs and SZO NWs are not 
significantly different from those of the ZnO NWs, the decreased 
integrated intensities of the GZO and SZO NWs are attributed to 
the decreased axial growth rate caused by Ga or Ag doping. 35 
Moreover, the (0002) peak of the GZO NPGs shifts to higher 
angles, indicating that the decrease of lattice parameter c is due to 
the smaller Ga3+ ions (0.47 ) substituting for larger Zn2+ ions 
(0.60 ). In contrast, the shifting of the (0002) peak of the SZO 
NWs to lower angles is due to the larger Ag+ ion (1.00  ) 40 
substituting for the Zn2+ ion. Similar phenomenon is also 
observed in SZO-GZO coaxial nanostructures. 
Figure 2(a) displays a TEM image of a SZO-GZO coaxial 
nanostructure shown in Fig. 1(c). The inset is a low-magniﬁcation 
image. The contour between the GZO core and the SZO shell is 45 
well-defined. Fig. 2(b) shows the HR-TEM image taken from the 
region A marked in Fig. 2(a), demonstrating the excellent crystal 
quality of the GZO core. The lattice spacing of the (0001) planes 
is measured as 0.523 nm. Crystal planes as well as directions 
could be deduced by fast Fourier transform (FFT) as a diffraction 50 
pattern with a [2110] zone axis (inset). 
Fig. 2(c) also shows the HR-TEM image taken from the 
region B marked in the inset of Fig. 2(a), demonstrating that the 
lattice of the SZO shell is slightly distorted. Defects like vacancy 
(V) and stacking faults (SF) are denoted by yellow arrows. These 55 
defects could be attributed to strains resulting from the much 
larger Ag+ ions substituting for Zn2+ ions. The lattice spacing of 
the (0001) planes is measured as 0.538 nm, which is slightly 
larger than that of the GZO core. The diffraction pattern shown in 
the inset has a [2 11 0] zone axis as deduced by FFT, 60 
demonstrating that the SZO shell is also single-crystalline. The 
crystallographic orientation relationships between the GZO core 
and the SZO shell are identified as below: 
[2110]GZO, core // [2110]SZO, shell 
(0002)GZO, core // (0002)SZO, shell 65 
It demonstrates the epitaxial nature of the SZO-GZO coaxial 
homojunction. 
Low-temperature (10 K) PL spectra shown in Figure 3 
could provide useful insights into the energy levels of either 
donors in the GZO NPGs or acceptors in the SZO NWs. Fig. 3(a) 70 
shows the low temperature (10 K) PL spectra of the GZO NPGs 
(Ga/Zn precursor ratio = 0.308) and the SZO NWs. Both 
nanostructures show only a prominent near-band-edge (NBE) 
peak near 3.360 eV, which is attributed to the emission by free 
excitons, polaritons, and bound excitons, revealing that these two 75 
nanostructures possess excellent crystal qualities. Broad deep-
level emission (DL) around 2.5 eV which is usually contributed 
by defects like oxygen vacancies and zinc interstitials is not 
observed. If the DL region is enlarged (inset), a very weak DL 
peak is found in SZO NWs while none is observed in GZO 80 
NPGs. It is consistent to the TEM observations shown in Fig. 2. 
Fig. 3(b) is a magnified plot near NBE region with a log 
scale intensity, demonstrating that GZO NPGs possess a 
dominant donor bound excitons (D X) at 3.360 eV, while SZO 
NWs possess a dominant acceptor bound excitons (A X) at 3.353 85 
eV, It suggests that GZO NPGs and SZO NWs are n-type and p-
type, respectively. In GZO NPGs, other peaks could be indexed 
as D	 X-TES (3.318 eV) in the two-electron satellite (TES) 
transitions region; and as D X-1LO (3.291 eV), TES-1LO (3.248 
eV), DAP (3.217 eV), DAP-1LO (3.146 eV) in the donor-90 
acceptor-pair (DAP) transitions and longitudinal optical (LO)-
phonon replicas region. If we examine the donor bound excitons 
(D X) peak further, it splits into two component peaks: D	X and 
D
X at 3.360 and 3.363 eV, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3(c).34 
The D	X line at 3.360 eV is very close to the I8 line at 3.359 eV, 95 
which is associated with the recombination of exciton bound to 
neutral Ga-donor observed by Mayer et. al..35 The TES 
transitions involve irradiative recombination of an exciton bound 
to a neutral donor, leaving the donor in the excited state. The 
energy difference between the ground-state neutral donor bound 100 
excitons and their excited states (TES) can be used to determine 
the donor binding energies (the donor excitation energy from the 
ground state to the first excited state equals to 3/4 of the donor 
binding energy, ED).
34 Herein, the Ga binding energy in GZO 
NPGs is calculated as 56 meV using the ground stare D	X line at 105 
3.360 eV and the first excited state D	X-TES line at 3.318 eV. 
This value is comparable to the 54.6 meV reported by Mayer et. 
al.,35 and 60 meV by Zhu et. al..36 
On the other hand, we can also identify several other peaks 
in the SZO NWs as free electron-to-acceptor (eA ) (3.310 eV) in 110 
the TES transitions region; and as DAP (3.217 eV), DAP-1LO 
(3.146 eV), DAP-2LO (3.093 eV) in the DAP transitions and LO-

and the SZO-ZnO coaxial nanostructures are summarized in 
Table 2 with typical results reported previously. Generally, the 
entire 1D SZO-GZO and the SZO-ZnO coaxial nanostructures in 
this work have better diode characteristics, such as lower VT, 
better RR, and better ideality factor n, than what were reported 5 
for 2D and 2D-1D nanostructures, either p-n heterojunctions or 
homojunctions. It is partly due to the presence of homojunction 
instead of heterojunction, and partly due to the increased area of 
nanosized junctions as well as the better crystal qualities of both 
the p and n 1D nanostructure.  10 
In comparing these two coaxial nanostructures, the SZO-
GZO possess smaller VT (1.28 relative to 3.22 V), larger forward 
bias currents (102.5 respect to 12.6 μA), better RR (24.5 relative 
to 8.8) and better ideality factor n (2.9 respect to 5.9) than the 
SZO-ZnO. It could be attributed to the much shallower levels of 15 
the Ga donor (56 meV) and the Ag acceptor (127 meV) than 
those of the intrinsic defects: 0.08~1.03 eV for zinc interstitials 
(Zni), 0.25~3 eV for oxygen vacancies (Vo), 0.26~0.35 eV for 
zinc vacancies (VZn), and 0.38~2.67 eV for oxygen interstitials 
(Oi).
46,47 The schematic energy levels are shown in Figure 6. 20 
4. Conclusions 
Entire 1D ZnO-based coaxial p-n homojunction 
nanostructures were fabricated by MOCVD. The n-type GZO 
NPG cores were grown on GZO seed layers first, then the p-type 
SZO shells were deposited sequentially on the GZO NPGs. Entire 25 
1D SZO-GZO and the SZO-ZnO coaxial nanostructures exhibit 
better diode characteristics, such as lower VT, better RR, and 
better ideality factor n, than what were reported for 2D and 2D-
1D p-n nanostructures, either heterojunctions or homojunctions. 
It is partly due to the presence of homojunction instead of 30 
heterojunction, and partly due to the increased area of nanosized 
junctions and the better crystal qualities of both the p and the n 
1D nanostructure. The binding energies of Ga and Ag were 
determined to be about 56 and 127 meV, respectively, by low-
temperature and temperature-dependent photoluminescence. The 35 
SZO-GZO coaxial p-n nanostructures show better diode 
properties than the SZO-ZnO ones.

phenomenon.31–33 Electrons emit from solid surfaces to the
vacuum level under strong electric fields. A potential-energy
barrier is present at the solid–vacuum interface. The ZNA–LNO
core–shell nanorod arrays on conducting GZO films prepared in
this work were demonstrated to be efficient field emitters due to
their unique geometry and electrical properties. Since the work
function of LNO (4.5 eV) is lower than that of ZnO (5.3 eV),
there is no Schottky barrier limiting the transfer of electrons; a
shallow well is formed in thermal equilibrium in the ZNA–LNO
heterojunction.29,32,34,35 When an electric field is applied, the
produced well is of much benefit to the flow of electrons from the
GZO films to the LNO shells through the ZNA; subsequently,
the emission of electrons into vacuum by tunneling could be
easily realized due to the low work function of the LNO coatings.
Our approach based on ZNA–LNO core–shell nanorod arrays
provides a simple and robust method to produce practical elec-
tron sources.
2. Experimental methods
2.1 Synthesis of ZNA–LNO core–shell nanorod arrays
In this study there are three steps in the experimental procedure.
Fig. 1a–c present a schematic diagram representing ZNA–LNO
core–shell nanorod arrays prepared on GZO seed layer/Si or
glass substrates.
Step (a): preparation of the GZO seed layer by sputtering. The
GZO films (seed layers) were deposited on the substrates by RF
magnetron sputtering using ZnO (purity 99.99%) mixed with 1 at
% Ga2O3 (purity 99.99%) as the ceramic target. The substrates
were cleaned by the usual semiconductor technology before
loading into the chamber. The sputtering of GZO films was
carried out under a rf power of 50 W and working pressure of 10
mTorr at room temperature for 60 minutes. The sputtering gas
was 100% Ar.
Step (b): growth of ZNAs by a hydrothermal method. The
ZNAs were grown on substrates using a hydrothermal method.
Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2$6H2O) and hexamethy-
lenetetramine (C6H12N4) were individually added to deionized
water to form two 0.01 M precursor solutions. These two
precursor solutions were then mixed together in a glass bottle.
The glass bottle with a substrate was then sealed and maintained
at 80 C for 2 h in order to grow ZNAs. After the growth of
ZNAs, the sample was removed from the mixed solutions, rinsed
with distilled water, and dried at room temperature.
Step (c): deposition of the LNO shell by sputtering. The LNO
shells were deposited on the above ZNA-containing substrates
by RF magnetron sputtering using a 99.99% LNO target at
substrate temperatures ranging from 25 to 550 C for 60 minutes.
RF deposition was carried out at a base pressure of 8 106 Torr
and a deposition pressure of 10 mTorr with an Ar to O2 ratio
of 7/3.
2.2 Characterization of ZNA–LNO core–shell nanorod arrays
Materials characterization. The electrical conduction proper-
ties were measured by a Hall-effect measurement (HL5500PC) at
room temperature. The crystal phases of ZNA–LNO core–shell
nanostructures were analyzed by grazing incidence X-ray
diffraction (GIXRD, PANalytical X’Pert Pro). A field emission
scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JEOL-6500) equipped
with an Oxford Instruments INCA Energy Dispersive X-ray
Spectroscopy (EDX) system was utilized to observe the
morphology and chemical composition. A high resolution
transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, JEM-3000F)
operating at 300 kV with a resolution limit of 0.17 nm was used
to characterize the microstructures. To prepare the TEM spec-
imen, the ZNA–LNO core–shell nanostructures were broken in
ethanol and then dispersed on copper grid supported by a holey
carbon film. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, VG
Scientific-Microlab 350) was used to examine the binding states
of Zn 2p, O 1s, La 3d, and Ni 2p orbitals in ZNA–LNO nano-
structures. The electrical characterization of ZNA–LNO core–
shell nanorods was evaluated using a conductive atomic force
microscope (C-AFM, NT-MDT Solver P47) with a Pt/Ir-coated
probe. The optical properties of the samples were measured by a
Hitachi U-3010 Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectrometer.
Field emission measurements. Electric field emission measure-
ments were made in a laboratory-built system at a base pressure
of 106 Torr. The samples were fixed on a stainless steel holder
and used as a cathode. The anode was a rod-like molybdenum
probe (1 mm diameter). A direct current voltage sweeping from
0 to 1100 V in steps of 20 V was applied to the sample. The
dependence of the field emission current on the anode–cathode
voltage was recorded automatically using a Keithley 2410 source
meter at intervals of 1 s.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology, structure, and surface chemistry
characterizations
The electrical properties of the GZO films (seed layers) prepared
on Si substrates were determined by a Hall-effect measurement
system at room temperature. The GZO film shows excellent n-
type conduction with a carrier concentration of 4.2  1019 cm3,
a mobility of 17.9 cm2 V1 s1, and a resistivity of 8.2 105 Um.
The properties of ZNA, such as the alignment as well as the
density of ZNA, are important factors affecting the growth of
LNO shells prepared by sputtering. Appropriate alignment and
nanorod density are required for preparing ZNA–LNO core–
shell hetero-structures and for further property measurements.
The GZO film provides an appropriate surface for the growth of
ZNA with low nanorod density and excellent vertical alignment.
The microstructure of the seed layer is known to affect the
alignment and density of ZNA greatly in our previous studies.36

An increase of probing depth can be achieved by increasing the
glancing angle in GIXRD. Different glancing angles ranging
from 0.2 to 1.0 in GIXRD were employed on the ZNA–LNO-
350 sample. The results are shown in Fig. 3b. At a low glancing
angle of 0.2, weak diffraction peaks of LNO and ZnO were
observed, which corresponds to a quite shallow X-ray penetra-
tion depth. By increasing the incident angles, the diffraction
intensity of ZnO was significantly enhanced. However, the
diffraction intensity of LNO increased only slightly. Such a
diffraction intensity dependence on the glancing angle of inci-
dence in GIXRD indicates that the top LNO shells were thicker
than the bottom LNO shells on ZNA, which is consistent with
the observations of the FESEM images in Fig. 2.
A typical low-magnification top-view FESEM image of the
sample (ZNA–LNO-350) is shown in Fig. 4a. It indicates that the
sputtering process provides an efficient, large-area, and uniform
deposition of LNO shells on the surface of the ZNA. The inset of
Fig. 4a is a charge coupled device (CCD) recorded image
showing a 2.2  2.2 cm2 Si substrate coated with uniformly
distributed ZNA–LNO composite nanorod arrays. The substrate
shows similar brown color due to absorption of visible wave-
length light by LNO layers. In the EDX spectrum shown in
Fig. 4b, all the expected elements including Zn, O, La, and Ni are
present. The Ni/La atomic ratio in the ZNA–LNO hetero-
structures can be estimated from the peak area ratio, which is
approximately 1.07, in agreement with the stoichiometric
composition of LNO.
TEM analysis was essential to examine the detailed micro-
structures of the ZNA–LNO core–shell hetero-structure. The
different contrast between the inside and the outside of a single
ZNA–LNO nanorod provides significant evidence of the core–
shell structure, as shown in Fig. 5a. The thickness of the LNO
shell (ZNA–LNO-350) was uniformly distributed along the
entire nanorod length and was determined to be about 10–20 nm
from the TEM image, consistent with the FESEM shown in
Fig. 2. Fig. 5b is a HRTEM image of the LNO head region of the
nanorod. Fig. 5c is a magnified HRTEM image of the square
area shown in Fig. 5b. Two d-spacings of 0.38 and 0.27 nm were
identified, which were consistent with the (100) and (110) planes,
respectively. Fig. 5d is the diffraction pattern transformed from
Fig. 5b. The zone axis of LNO is [001]. After careful inspection of
the d-spacing and the angle of diffraction points, the diffraction
pattern of the LNO shell can be indexed as (100) and (110) planes
of a perovskite structured material, which is consistent with the
results of the GIXRD studies.
XPS, a sensitive and powerful surface analysis method, is able
to provide information on chemical bonding states of elements in
the samples and the surface chemistry. The samples of the ZNA
and the ZNA–LNO-350 were further detected by high-resolution
XPS. Fig. 6a shows the spectra of the Zn 2p region of the ZNA
and the ZNA–LNO-350. It displays a doublet at 1022.4 and
1045.3 eV corresponding to the Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 core levels
of Zn2+ ions for the ZNA.37–39 Notably, the Zn 2p signal is not
observed in the ZNA–LNO-350 sample due to the covering up of
the LNO shell.
As shown in Fig. 6b, the asymmetric O 1s peaks of the ZNA
and the ZNA–LNO-350 can be observed. For the ZNA, the O 1s
peak can be deconvolved into two peaks: 530.2 and 532.0 eV,
which suggests the existence of two different environments of
oxygens.37–39 The higher energy peak (532.0 eV) is derived from
the surface adsorbed oxygen which is probably due to environ-
mental moisture trapped in the ZNA surface. The lower energy
peak (530.2 eV) originates from O2 ions full surrounded by Zn
ions. For the ZNA–LNO-350, the deconvolved peaks locate at
binding energies of 528.8 and 532.0 eV. The 528.8 eV peak is

According to the Fowler–Nordheim (F–N) model, the field
emission current from a metal or semiconductor is attributed to
the tunneling of electrons from the material into vacuum through
a potential barrier under the influence of the electric field. The
relationship between the current density (J) and the applied field
strength (E) can be depicted as:31–33

whereA and B are constants with values of 1.56 1010 A V2 eV
and 6.83 103 V eV3/2 mm1, respectively. f is the work function
of the emitting material (the work functions are 5.3 eV for ZnO
and 4.5 eV for LNO).29,32,34,35 J is the current density in mA cm2
and E is the electrical field in V mm1. b is the field-enhancement
factor, which quantifies the ability of a specific emitter to amplify
E. The field-enhancement factor relates to the geometry, crystal
structure, and spatial distribution of the emitting centers.28 The
field-enhancement factor can be derived from the slope of the
ln(J/E2) – 1/E curve, called the F–N plot in Fig. 7b. The field-
enhancement factors of the LNO film, ZNA, and ZNA–LNO-
350 are 128, 280, and 673, respectively. It is apparent that the b
factor of the ZNA–LNO-350 is much greater than that of the
LNO film and the ZNA.
The field emission properties of nanorods depended on the
aspect ratio.48–50 ZnO nanorods with higher aspect ratio showed
higher emission current density. In this regard, longer nanorods
in the samples may contribute mainly to the observed field
emission properties. The aspect ratio of ZnO nanorods did not
change significantly after LNO deposition. The improved field
emission properties are considered to originate from the LNO
layer. It is interesting to explore the nature which results in the
excellent field emission for the ZNA–LNO composite nanorod
arrays. Firstly, based on the existing mechanisms of electron field
emission, the low work function of the LNO materials made it
easy for the ZNA coated with the LNO shells to emit electrons
under the action of electric field.31 In addition, since the work
function of LNO is lower than that of ZnO, there is no Schottky
barrier limiting the transfer of electrons in the ZNA–LNO het-
erojunction. Secondly, it is expected that the density of interfacial
defects of the nano-sized hetero-structures is relatively low as
compared with that of the film-based hetero-structures.51 A large
number of electrons could be injected from the n-type GZO film
to the LNO coating through the ZNA without interruption by
interfacial defects, which is a significant factor to improve field
emission. Moreover, the thickness of LNO shells was much less,
approximately 10–20 nm; the probability of compounding and
seizing electrons in the thinner layer is lower than in the thicker
layer, which benefits the further enhancement of the field emis-
sion properties.52 Thirdly, the ZNA–LNO composite nanorod
arrays have a well-aligned morphology and a special geometry
with sharp tips on their head regions, as seen in the SEM and
TEM images in Fig. 2 and 5. Compared with the previous report
of random ZnO nanostructures, well-aligned nanostructures
with sharp edges have better field emission properties.24,29 The
nanostructured materials (such as Si-based, carbon nanotube,
and graphene oxide) with nanometer-scale sharp tips exhibit
excellent electron emission characteristics due to the local field
enhancement which decreases the barrier width at the tip and the
barrier width, allowing electrons to tunnel into vacuum at low
electric fields.25–27,30
To explain the results more clearly we use a model of a metal–
semiconductor heterojunction (LNO–ZNA heterojunction),
which is valid for the present system owing to the difference in
their work functions, electron affinities, and conductive types.53
Fig. 8a shows the energy band diagram of an isolated metallic
material (LNO) adjacent to an isolated n-type semiconductor
(ZNA). Note that the metal work function qfm is generally
different from the semiconductor work function qfs. The work
function is defined as the energy difference between the Fermi
level and the vacuum level. Also shown is the electron affinity qc,
which is the energy difference between the conduction band edge
and the vacuum level in the semiconductor. ZnO is a natural
n-type semiconductor possessing an electron affinity of 4.2 eV.35
Their work functions were mentioned above. When the LNO
makes an intimate contact with the ZNA, the Fermi levels in the
two materials must be equal at thermal equilibrium.53
In addition, the vacuum level must be continuous. Fig. 8b is
the heterojunction band diagram of the LNO-coated ZNA in
thermal equilibrium. Band bending occurs at the ZNA–LNO
interface and a shallow well is formed in thermal equilibrium.
When enough electric field is applied, the produced well is
beneficial to the transportation of electrons from the ZNA to the
LNO coatings. Consequently, the emission of electrons into
vacuum by tunneling is easily realized due to the low work
function of the LNO coatings. It reasonably explains how the
field emission properties of the ZNA–LNO composite nanorod
arrays have been improved significantly as compared with those
of bare ZNAs.
The electrical characteristics of ZNA–LNO nanorod arrays
were straightforwardly measured by C-AFM at room tempera-
ture. The schematic diagram depicts the current–voltage (I–V)
measurement system used for C-AFM, as shown in Fig. 9a. Since
the C-AFM Pt/Ir-coated cantilever tip diameter (15 nm) was
smaller than the ZNA–LNO nanorod diameter (50–100 nm), the
electric current through a vertical single nanorod and the GZO
film could be successfully measured as a function of voltage.

LNO and the probe distinctly located at A, B, and C positions for

via a combination process of hydrothermal synthesis for ZNA
and the sputtering process for LNO. The conducting LNO shells
crystallized to form a perovskite structure at 350 C on the ZNA
by sputtering. The resulting ZnO–LNO core–shell hetero-struc-
tures were characterized by FESEM, GIXRD, HRTEM, XPS,
C-AFM, and UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy. In particular, the
1D ZNA–LNO composite system shows excellent field emission
properties. The turn-on field and the threshold field exhibit an
enormous decrease from 22.9 and 28.4 V mm1, respectively, for
the bare ZNA, to 8.6 and 10.3 V mm1, respectively, for the
ZNA–LNO core–shell hetero-structures. The considerably
improved field emission properties originate from the low work
function of the LNO layer and good electric transport property,
as well as the vertically aligned sharp tips of the ZNA–LNO
hetero-structures. This composite nano-architecture synthesis
methodology could be easily extended to other semiconductor–
perovskite composite systems.

 1. Introduction 
 In recent decades, zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostructures (e.g., 
nanodots, nanorods, nanobelts, and so forth) have been 
extensively studied due to their attractive properties, such 
as excellent optoelectronic properties, high surface area to 
volume ratio, and convenient surface tailorability. [ 1–3 ] In par-
ticular, one-dimensional ZnO nanostructures have drawn 
intensive attention by the fact that they constitute suitable 
building blocks for various promising applications in the 
fi elds of nanogenerators, nanosensors, light-emitting diodes, 
photovoltaic cells, and photocatalysts in environmental puri-
fi cation. [ 4–8 ] For photocatalytic degradation of hazardous 
pollutants, 1D ZnO nanostructures, comparing with fi lm-
based ZnO, have been recognized as preferable materials for 
photocatalytic processes due to their high surface area, effi -
cient charge transport, excellent photosensitivity and optical 
anti-refl ection ability. [ 9–11 ] However, a main limitation of 
high photocatalytic effi ciency in semiconductors is the quick 
recombination of charge carriers. [ 12–14 ] The photogenerated 
electrons and holes recombine easily (around 90%) due to 
the direct band gap in the photocatalytic processes. [ 15 ] There-
fore, promoting separation of photoexcited electron-hole 
pairs and prolonging their lifetime in semiconductors are cru-
cial in improving photocatalytic activity. 
 Comparing with single-phase semiconductor photocata-
lysts, hybrids of semiconductor-based heterostructures seem 
to possess advantages in utilizing solar light more effi ciently 
through effects due to their electronic structures. [ 16,17 ] Fur-
thermore, feasible electron and/or hole transfer from one 
component unit to another with proper band edge posi-
tions can greatly decrease the electron-hole recombination 
probability and increase the lifetime of charge carriers, thus 
promoting the photocatalytic effi ciency. [ 18–20 ] Works corre-
lating with photocatalytic activity in most mentioned reports 
were based on powdered ZnO-Au composites. [ 21–23 ] How-
ever, from the point of view of pollutant degradation with 
minimal energy input for the slurry photocatalytic systems, 
there are some drawbacks including particle aggregation, 
poor durability and recycle ability, and/or the need for fi l-
tration in the cyclic photocatalytic processes. [ 24,25 ] In addi-
tion, it may cause secondary pollution after photocatalytic 
reactions. To solve these problems, an ideal way is to grow 
the ZnO-Au composites on certain substrates in the form 
of an ordered fi lm without agglomeration. However, cur-
rent ZnO-Au photo catalysts are generally obtained by 
randomly loading Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) onto the ZnO-
containing substrates, which hinders the realization of highly 
effi cient photocatalysts for environmental purifi cation. [ 26 , 27 ] 
The AuNPs were directly reduced from metal salt precur-
sors (HAuCl 4 ) and were formed with aggregation on the top 
regions of the ZnO nanostructures. Therefore, the consider-
ably low effi ciency of the photocatalysts grown directly on 
solid substrates than that of the corresponding slurries has to 
be resolved. So far, there exist no highly effi cient nanocom-
posite photocatalysts which are easy to handle and recyclable 
for practical applications. 
 In pursuit of the next-generation photocatalysts, we pro-
pose one approach to synthesize large-scale, highly effi cient 
photocatalysts composed of monolayered AuNPs which are 
chemically bonded to vertically aligned ZnO nanorod arrays 
(ZNA) through thioctic acid (TA) as a bifunctional surface 
molecular linker, as shown in  Scheme  1 . High density AuNPs, 
dispersed perfectly on entire surface of ZNA, can be suc-
cessfully prepared on a conductive fi lm/substrate, which 
allows easy recycle of photocatalysts. In comparison with 
the bare ZNA, the optimal ZNA-AuNPs heterostructures 
exhibit 8.1-fold enhanced photodegradation rate under UV 
irradiation. High density unaggregated AuNPs on the ZNA 
surfaces effectively prolong the lifetime of the photoexcited 
charge carriers, enlarge the reaction space, and consequently 
enhance the photocatalytic activity for degradation of organic 
pollutants. Photoelectron, photoluminescence and photocon-
ductive measurements confi rm the discussion on the charge 
carrier separation and photocatalytic experimental results. 
 In this study, we systematically investigated the synthesis, 
structure, morphology, optical, surface chemistry, photocata-

of the seed layer is known to greatly affect the alignment and 
density of ZNA in our previous studies. [ 32 ] 
 Figure 2 a–e show the fi eld emission scanning electron 
miscroscopy (FESEM) of the ZNA and the ZNA-AuNPs 
heterostructures with AuNPs prepared by the chemical 
assembly method at various AuNPs concentrations of 3.125, 
6.25, 12.5, and 25 nM for 1 h. The corresponding tilt-angle 
images are also shown in Figure  2 f–j. The ZNA displays six 
prismatic planes in Figure  2 a and shows good c-axis align-
ment in Figure  2 f. The average size and standard deviation 
of length and diameter of the ZNA are 263  ± 58 nm and 44  ± 
10 nm by measuring 150 nanorods, respectively. When a small 
amount of 15 nm AuNPs was dispersed on the ZNA, for 
example 3.125 and 6.25 n m , most of the AuNPs were depos-
ited on top regions of the ZNA, as shown in Figure  2 g,h. With 
a further increase in the concentration of AuNPs to 12.5 n m , 
the ZNA were successfully decorated by many well-dispersed 
AuNPs (Figure  2 i). High density monolayered AuNPs were 
linked molecularly to the entire surface of ZNA. Addition-
ally, the uniformly distributed AuNPs were also observed to 
exhibit a monolayered coverage on the GZO fi lm. 
 When the concentration of AuNPs increased to 25 n m , 
the morphology of the ZNA-AuNPs heterostructures did not 
change (Figure  2 j). The AuNPs on the surface of the ZNA 
remained unaggregated. Most recently, some research groups 
reported AuNPs decorated ZnO nanostructures by reducing 
metal salt precursors (HAuCl 4 ) directly. 
[ 26 , 27 ] However, the 
AuNPs were not uniformly deposited over the entire surface 
of the ZnO nanostructures. Attached AuNPs were observed 
to have density variation with a higher density region near 
the top of the ZnO. In addition, the size distribution of the 
particles and the amount of Au were not controlled synchro-
nously. These problems may hinder the realization of highly 
effi cient photocatalysts for environmental purifi cation. In this 
study, the fabricated ZNA loading with AuNPs was demon-
strated to possess several highly desirable features for photo-
catalytic applications: high coverage density of nanoparticles 
without aggregation, good morphology control, and both are 
in a scalable and controllable manner. [ 33 ] 
 Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis was used to 
quantitatively determine the Au content in the ZNA-AuNPs 
heterostructures. The concentration of the solution with 
AuNPs had a signifi cant effect on the amount of AuNPs 
incorporating in the structures ( Figure  3 a). The Au content 
in the ZNA-AuNPs heterostructures increased linearly with 
an increase of the Au concentration of the synthesis solu-
tion from 0 to 12.5 n m . Above 12.5 n m , the loading content 
of AuNPs onto ZNA remained essentially unchanged, which 
indicated that the maximal Au loading content in the ZNA-
AuNPs heterostructures was 1.75–1.80 at%. 
 Figure  3 b shows the grazing incidence X-ray diffraction 
(GIXRD) patterns of ZNA and ZNA-AuNPs heterostruc-
tures with different Au content (0.37, 0.82, 1.77, and 1.78 at%, 
which are expressed as ZNA-AuNPs-1, ZNA-AuNPs-2, 
ZNA-AuNPs-3, and ZNA-AuNPs-4, respectively) measured 
under a fi xed incidence angle of 0.5 ° . All diffraction peaks 
of the ZNA can be indexed to the hexagonal wurtzite struc-
ture of ZnO (JCPDS No. 36-1451). The strong (002) intensity 
of ZNA indicates that the ZNA grows preferentially along 
the (001) direction, which was approximately perpendicular 
to the GZO seed layers. It is in accordance with the FESEM 
observations in Figure  2 . For ZNA-AuNPs heterostructures 
obtained with different Au content, the presence of major Au 
(111) and minor Au (200) planes in the diffraction patterns 
confi rms the coverage of AuNPs on ZNA. The increase of the 
Au (111) peak intensity with the loading Au content reveals 
the increasing coverage of AuNPs on ZNA. 
 The optical transmission spectra of the ZNA and the ZNA-
AuNPs heterostructures prepared on glass substrates were 
recorded by an UV-Vis spectrometer, as shown in Figure  3 c. 
It can be seen that the pure ZnO (band gap 3.37 eV) shows a 
steep absorption at wavelength shorter than 380 nm. The gold

provided photocurrent enhancement; however, its aggregates 
might suppress photocurrent and degrade device perfor-
mance. Peh et al. reported that a thick layer of aggregated 
AuNPs on ZnO nanostructures led to the distortion of 
plasmonic effect, which produced a counter effect of sup-
pressing the photocurrent in the photovoltaic cells. [ 36 ] In this 
study, both the well dispersion of the AuNPs on the ZNA 
and the accurate control of the Au loading are benefi cial for 
improving photocatalytic activities of nanostructures. 
 Figure 4 a depicts a typical TEM image of the well-dis-
persed AuNPs on the ZnO nanorod (ZNA-AuNPs-3), which 
is consistent with the FESEM shown in Figure  2 . Figure  4 b,c 
are the HRTEM images of the side region of a single ZnO 
nanorod with AuNPs decoration. It is obvious that the unag-
gregated monolayered AuNPs have a uniform size of about 
15 nm. The diffraction pattern (inset in Figure  4 b) trans-
formed from the square area reveals that the wurtzite ZNA 
is single crystalline in nature. As shown in Figure  4 c, the 
lattice spacing values of 0.23 and 0.52 nm can be indexed to 
the (111) plane of Au and the (001) plane of ZnO, respec-
tively. The perpendicular direction of the (001) planes of 
ZnO matches the ZNA growth direction, implying that (001) 
is the rod growing direction, which is consistent with the 
GIXRD results. Elemental maps of the AuNPs decorated 
ZnO nanorod from the selective area indicated in Figure  4 d 
are shown in Figure  4 e,f for elements Au and S, respectively. 
The result reveals that the TA-functionalized AuNPs dis-
tribute uniformly on the surface of the ZnO nanorod. 
 The ZNA-AuNPs-3 was further investigated by high-
resolution XPS. In the curve-fi tted C 1s region of the XPS 
spectrum ( Figure  5 a), the ZNA-AuNPs heterostructure 
exhibits peak components with binding energies at 284.6 eV 
(C-C), 286.9 eV (C-S), and 288.2 eV ((C  = O)-O), which are 
related to the chemical structure of TA. [ 37 ] Figure  5 b repre-
sents the S 2p region of the XPS spectrum of the ZNA-AuNPs 
heterostructure. The S 2p region exhibits S 2p doublet with 
binding energies of 161.0 eV (S 2p 3/2 ) and 162.2 eV (S 2p 1/2 ) 
obtained from the curve fi tting of the data. It suggests that 
the single species is indeed a thiolate (S-Au). [ 38 ] No evi-
dence of oxidation of the sulfur was observed for which extra 
sulfur peaks would occur at 168.1 eV (S 2p 3/2 ) and 169.0 eV 
(S 2p 1/2 ), corresponding to sulfones or sulfates. 
[ 39 ] This result 
is consistent with previous studies, confi rming the formation 
of covalent bonds between gold and sulfur. [ 38 , 39 ] 
 Furthermore, the Au 4f and Zn 3p regions of the XPS 
spectrum of the ZNA-AuNPs heterostructure are presented 
in Figure  5 c, indicating that the AuNPs were bound to the 
ZNA with molecular linkers. It can be seen that the Au 4f 
peaks partially overlap with that of Zn 3p. [ 40 ] The Au 4f 7/2 
peak is clearly observed at binding energy of 82.9 eV, while 
part of Au 4f 5/2 peak (at 86.4 eV) is overlapped by the signal 
of Zn 3p. The binding energy positions are much lower than 
that of bulk metallic Au (84.0 and 87.6 eV for Au 4f 7/2 and 
Au 4f 5/2 , respectively), indicating strong metal-support inter-
actions between the AuNPs and the ZNA. [ 41 ] Similar binding 
energy was reported for AuNPs decorated on ZnO or TiO 2 
nanoparticles. [ 40 , 42 ] One reason for such pronounced negative 
shift is the larger electronegativity of Au relative to Zn. Con-
sequently, the XPS data prove that AuNPs are successfully 
bound to the ZNA with chemical bonds by the bifunctional-
ized TA molecules. 
 2.3. Photocatalytic Activity and Mechanism 
 The photocatalytic activity of the ZNA-AuNPs was evaluated 
by degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) dyes. GZO fi lm and 
ZNA were used for comparison.  Figure  6 shows the results of 
 Figure  5 .  XPS spectra: a) C 1s, b) S 2p, c) Au 4f and Zn 3p regions of the

metal or metal oxide decoration (as summarized in  Table  2 ), 
the formation of high density unaggregated AuNPs on the 
entire surface of ZNA in this work demonstrates to improve 
the photocatalytic activity drastically (8.1 fold enhanced deg-
radation rate ratio). [ 26 , 27 , 44–52 ] 
 To test the stability of the ZNA-AuNPs-3, we examined 
the photodegradation of RhB for 15 cycles under identical 
conditions. After each cycle, the ZNA-AuNPs heterostructure 
was washed and dried thoroughly, and then fresh RhB solution 
was added. After 15 cycles, the photocatalytic activity of the 
ZNA-AuNPs heterostructure remains unaffected, as shown in 
 Figure  7 a. The degradation percentages of RhB were above 
90% after 1.5 h under the UV irradiation for each photocata-
lytic cycle. Figure  7 b shows the FESEM images of the ZNA-
AuNPs heterostructure after 15 photocatalytic cycles. It can be 
seen that the morphology of the ZNA-AuNPs heterostructure 
is unchanged after 15 cycles of reuse. The inset in Figure  7 b is 
a high-magnifi cation FESEM image, indicating that the AuNPs 
on the surface of the ZNA remain unaggregated. 
 Moreover, after 15 photocatalytic cycles, the chemical 
bonding state of sulfur of the ZNA-AuNPs heterostructure 
was further investigated by high-resolution XPS (Figure  7 c). 
The S 2p regions of XPS spectra are almost identical for 
freshly prepared ZNA-AuNPs heterostructure (Figure  5 b) 
and 15 photocatalytic cyclic ZNA-AuNPs heterostructure 
(Figure  7 c). The peak positions at 161.0 eV (S 2p 3/2 ) and 
162.2 eV (S 2p 1/2 ) correspond to the thiolate (S-Au). 
[ 38 ] 
This result clearly indicates that thiolate is indeed still pre-
sent in the TA-functionalized AuNPs, and no oxidation of 
the sulfur is observed for which extra sulfur peaks would 
occur at 168.1 eV (S 2p 3/2 ) and 169.0 eV (S 2p 1/2 ), corre-
sponding to sulfones or sulfates. [ 38 , 39 ] These results show 
that TA ligands and the carboxylate binding groups on ZnO 
are reasonably stable against UV irradiation. Similarly, Lee 
et al. demonstrated that the glutathione-protected AuNPs on 
ZnO nanoparticles are excellently stable for photodegrada-
tion of thionine dyes under UV irradiation. [ 53 ] Therefore, the 
ZNA-AuNPs photocatalysts demonstrated in this work show 
excellent stability and high photocatalytic activities, which 
exhibit their potential as candidates for practical applications 
in environmental purifi cation. 
 It is interesting to explore the nature of the excellent 
photo catalytic activities of the ZNA-AuNPs heterostructures. 
It is known that the feasible photoinduced electron and/
or hole transfer from one component unit to another with 
proper band edge positions in the heterostructures can greatly 
decrease the electron-hole recombination probability, thus 
promoting the photocatalytic effi ciency. [ 18–20 ] In this ZNA-
AuNPs heterostructure system, it is important to know how 
the AuNPs linked molecularly to the surface of ZNA infl u-
ences the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. To 
realize this charge separation mechanism in the ZNA-AuNPs 
heterostructures, the electronic band information of the TA-
functionalized AuNPs and the ZNA was further analyzed by 
ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). 
 Figure 8 a shows the UPS spectrum of the TA-functionalized 
AuNPs taken with He I radiation. The work function ( Φ ) of the 
sample can be calculated using the following equation: [ 54 , 55 ] 
  = hv − Eonset  (2) 
 where  hv is 21.2 eV, representing the incident photon energy, 
and  E onset is secondary electron onset level. Note that the 
peak near the onset level is caused by the secondary electrons 
instead of the electrons emitted from the valence band. [ 54 , 55 ] 
The secondary electron onset position of the TA-functional-
ized AuNPs is determined by the extrapolation, as shown in 
the inset of Figure  8 a. Therefore, the work function of the TA-
functionalized AuNPs is estimated to be 4.00  ± 0.15 eV by using 
 Equation 2 . Boer and co-workers demonstrated that the tuning 
of metal work function by chemically modifying the metal sur-
faces through the formation of chemisorbed self-assembled 
monolayer alkanethiols. [ 56 ] They reported that the modifi cation 
of Au with a self-assembled monolayer of hexadecanethios low-
ered the work function by 0.8 eV to 4.1 eV, due to the interface-
dipole formation of the hexadecanethios on Au. Marmont et al. 
also demonstrated that the Au is modifi ed with self-assembled

can act as the sink for the storage of photo generated electrons, 
thus, create numerous active adsorption sites and photocata-
lytic reaction centers. The electronic acceptors like adsorbed 
O 2 can easily trap the photoinduced electrons to produce a 
superoxide anion radical ( . O 2 
 −  ). [ 12–14 , 62 ] Goto and co-workers 
have focused on analyzing mole cular oxygen reduction to  . O 2 
 −  , 
which determined the overall photocatalytic reaction. [ 62 ] Simul-
taneously, the high concentration of holes on the ZNA can be 
easily trapped by OH  −  to further produce a hydroxyl radical 
species ( . OH), which is an extremely strong oxidant for partial 
or complete mineralization of organic pollutants. [ 12–14 , 62 ] 
 Therefore, we conclude that the photo catalytic process 
was dominated by the following reactions:
 ZnO + hv → ZnO
(
e−cb + h+vb
)
 (3) 
 ZnO(e
−
cb) + Au → ZnO + Au(e−)  (4) 
 Au(e

 ZnO
(
h+vb
) + OH− → ZnO + .OH  (6) 
 
.O−2 or
.OH + RhB → degradation of RhB  
 (7) 
 Based on the above discussion, we 
conclude the following. Under UV irra-
diation, the ZNA-AuNPs heterostructures 
induced electron-hole pairs through the 
photogeneration process ( Reaction 3 ). 
In effect, the photogenerated electrons 
instantly transfer from the conduction 
band of the ZNA to the AuNPs driven 
by the energy difference via tunneling 
conduction mechanism, and simultane-
ously these electrons on the surface of the 
AuNPs can be captured by the adsorbed 
O 2 molecules to produce  
. O 2 
 −  radical 
( Reaction 4 , 5 ). Meanwhile, the holes on 
the surface of the ZNA can be scavenged 
by the ubiquitous H 2 O mole cules to yield 
 . OH radical ( Reaction 6 ). In this case, the 
RhB dyes can be subsequently destroyed 
by the  . O 2 
 −  or  . OH radicals owing to their 
high activities ( Reaction 7 ). It reasonably 
explains how the photocatalytic activities 
of ZNA-AuNPs heterostructures have 
been improved signifi cantly, as compared 
with those of bare ZNAs, as shown in 
Figure  8 d. In summary, the aforemen-
tioned ways in which photoexcited elec-
trons in the conduction band of ZnO are 
transferred improve the separation of the 
photoexcited electron-hole pairs, effec-
tively prolong the lifetime of the charge 
carriers, enlarge the reaction space, and 
consequently enhance the photocatalytic 
activity for degradation of RhB dyes. 
 The photocatalytic reaction depends 
largely upon the life of electron-hole pair separation. PL 
emission spectra of various photocatalyst samples can be 
used to investigate the photo generated charge carrier sepa-
ration, and to understand why introduction of AuNPs leads 
to enhanced photocatalytic activities for RhB degradation. 
 Figure  9 presents the PL spectra of the bare ZNA and ZNA-
AuNPs heterostructures with an excitation wavelength of 
325 nm. The main emission peak is centered at about 374 
nm in each spectrum, which can be ascribed to the band gap 
recombination of electron-hole pairs (Figure  9 a). [ 1 , ,5–7 , 63 , ,64 ] 
In addition, a weak and broad emission band appears in the 
visible range, indicating the existence of low-density deep-
level defects. The deep-level defect has commonly been

deposited by focusing ion beam technique, and the photocur-
rent was measured using a two-probe method. Figure  10 b 
is a representative FESEM image of the AuNPs decorated 
ZnO based photoconductive device. The diameter of the 
nanorod is  ≈ 0.55  μ m, and the spacing between the electrodes 
is 4.30  μ m. The high-magnifi cation FESEM image in the inset 
of Figure  10 b shows the uniform distribution of AuNPs on 
the individual ZnO nanorod surfaces. 
 Figure  10 c displays the comparative  I – V curves of the 
two samples. For the pristine ZnO nanorod, a photoexcited 
current of 15.1  μ A was recorded at a bias of 1.0 V, whereas 
for the decorated one, a high photocurrent of 22.6  μ A was 
achieved at the same bias voltage. Apparently, the photo-
current increased nearly 1.5 times after AuNPs decoration, 
which can be elucidated according to the band diagram of 
the ZNA-AuNPs heterostructures, as shown in Figure  8 d. 
The enhancement is caused by the charge carrier separation 
effect due to the existence of the high density unaggregated 
AuNPs on the ZnO nanorod surfaces. Thereby the lifetime of 
photoexcited electron-hole pairs is effectively prolonged for 
the AuNPs decorated ZnO nanorod. It is consistent with the 
discussion on the charge carrier separation and photocata-
lytic experimental data in this study. Similarly, Kamat and co-
workers have reported that the photocurrent of the TiO 2 -Au 
nanoparticles is higher than that of the bare TiO 2 under UV 
light by the photoelectrochemical measurements. [ 59 ] 
 3. Conclusion 
 In summary, we demonstrate a highly effi cient photocata-
lyst for environmental purifi cation by decorating AuNPs on 
single-crystal ZNA. By using bifunctional surface modifi ers, 
the uniformly distributed AuNPs were assembled onto the 
entire surface of the ZNA preparing on a conductive fi lm/
substrate. The loading content of the AuNPs on ZNA can 
be easily controlled, which is one of the key parameters for 
improving the photocatalytic properties as well as the pho-
todegradation rate. In comparison with the bare ZNA, the 
optimal ZNA-AuNPs heterostructures exhibited 8.1-fold 
enhanced photodegradation rate under UV irradiation. The 
higher photodegradation rates recorded in this study demon-
strate that the ZNA-AuNPs are candidates for the practical 
environmental photocatalysts, replacing the conventional 
powder photocatalysts. To optimize the performance of the 
ZNA-AuNPs photocatalysts, it is important to understand 
the effect of the AuNPs size on photocatalytic property, 
which is currently under our investigation. We envisage that 
our approach will be very useful for creating novel high effi -
ciency photocatalysts in many fi elds such as CO oxidation 
and water splitting. [ 66,67 ] 
 4. Experimental Section 
 4.1. Synthesis of AuNP-Decorated ZNA 
 Step (a): Preparation of GZO Seed Layer by Sputtering : The 
GZO fi lms (seed layers) were deposited on Si substrates by radio 
frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering using ZnO (purity 99.99%) 
mixed with 1 at% Ga 2 O 3 (purity 99.99%) as a ceramic target. The 
sputtering of GZO fi lms were carried out under RF power 60 W and 
working pressure 10 mTorr at room temperature for 50 min. The 
sputtering gas was 100% Ar. 
 Step (b): Growth of ZNA by a Hydrothermal Method : ZNAs were 
grown on GZO/Si substrates using a hydrothermal method. Zinc 
nitrate hexahydrate and hexamethylenetetramine were individu-
ally added to deionized water to form two 0.01  M precursor solu-
tions. These two precursor solutions were mixed together in a glass 
bottle. The glass bottle with a GZO/Si substrate was then sealed 
and maintained at 90  ° C for 2.5 h in order to grow ZNA. After the 
growth of ZNA, the sample was removed from the mixed solutions, 
rinsed with distilled water, and dried at room temperature. 
 Step (c): Synthesis of Citrate-Stabilized AuNPs : The citrate-sta-
bilized AuNPs were synthesized by controlling the ratio of HAuCl 4 
to sodium citrate concentrations according to the classic Turkevich-
Frens method. [ 68 ] To synthesize citrate-stabilized 15 nm AuNPs, 
190 ml of aqueous solution of HAuCl 4 (72  μ mol) was brought to 
refl ux with vigorous stirring, then 10 mL of 1% sodium citrate solu-
tion (340  μ mol) was added rapidly. The solution was refl uxed for 
additional 15 min, then gradually cooled to room temperature and 
stored in 4  ° C for future functionalization. 
 Step (d): Fabrication of TA-Functionalized AuNPs: 10 mg of TA 
were added to 200 mL of citrate-stabilized AuNPs, of which basici-
ties were pre-adjusted to pH  = 11 by 0.5  M NaOH, and left for self-
assembling for 48 h. Excess TA was removed via centrifugation. 
 Step (e): Synthesis of Chemically Assembled ZNA-AuNPs Het-
erostructures : A ZNA-containing substrate was baked at 450  ° C for 
20 min. After cooling in air for 10 min, the substrate was immedi-
ately placed nanorod-side up on the bottom of a vial containing 
TA-functionalized AuNPs, which have been dispersed for 1 h. The 
produced ZNA-AuNPs heterostructures were then washed with dis-
tilled water to remove excess TA-functionalized AuNPs. 
 4.2. Characterization of AuNP-Decorated ZNA 
 Materials characterization : The electrical conduction properties 
were measured by a Hall-effect measurement (HL5500PC) at room 
temperature. The optical properties were measured by a Hitachi 
U-3010 UV-Vis spectrometer. FTIR spectra were obtained using Perkin 
Elmer spectrum 100 instrument. The crystal phases of ZNA-AuNPs 
heterostructures were analyzed by grazing incidence X-ray diffrac-
tion (GIXRD, PANalytical X’Pert Pro). Field emission scanning electron 
microscopy (FESEM, JEOL-6500) equipped with an Oxford Instru-
ments INCA Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) system was 
utilized to observe the morphology and the chemical composition. 
A high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, JEM-
3000F) operating at 300 kV was used to characterize the microstruc-
tures. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, VG Scientifi c-Microlab 
350) was used to examine the binding states in the samples. The 
photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was gathered by exciting the 
samples with a continuous wave He-Cd laser (325 nm). The photo-
conductive characteristics of individual ZnO-based nanorod were 
analyzed with a semiconductor parameter analyzer (Agilent, B1500A) 
illuminating with UV light at 254 nm wavelength. 
 Photoelectron measurements : The UPS spectra were measured 
via He I (21.2 eV) as excitation sources in an ultrahigh vacuum

    本次發表的內容是有關鐵酸鉍奈米結構的製備及其電性與壓電特性的量測，因為直接成長鐵
酸鉍奈米結構於基板上並不容易，所以藉由模版法來製備鐵酸鉍奈米結構，所使用的模板為氧化
鋅奈米柱陣列，因為製備氧化鋅奈米柱陣列是相當簡單且成熟的技術，在其上濺鍍鐵酸鉍，即可
形成鐵酸鉍的奈米結構，然而直接鍍製鐵酸鉍在氧化鋅奈米柱上之鐵酸鉍 呈現非晶的狀態，因
此，利用鎳酸鑭當作緩衝層鍍製於鐵酸鉍與氧化鋅奈米柱之間，可以增加鐵酸鉍在氧化鋅奈柱上
之附著性及幫助鐵酸鉍形成多晶的型態，利用導電式原子力顯微鏡量測電流-電壓曲線並推導電流
傳導機制，發現正偏壓端之主導機制為 Pool-Frenkel emission，負偏壓端之主導機 制為 Schottky 
emission，此外，利用壓電力顯微鏡量測其壓電特性並推導其極化量，發現此結構擁有良好的壓
電特性，壓電常數大約 32.93pm/V，極化量為 133 μC/cm2，比先前鐵酸鉍薄膜的文獻值還高。
