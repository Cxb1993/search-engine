ABSTRACT對粉末冶金工件而言，在脫脂過程中若脫脂過當會連石墨亦部分脫除，但若脫脂
不完全則可能造成滲碳，造成合金鋼機械性質之不穩定。因此，若能了解脫脂過程中碳含量變化
以及碳存在的方式，對於材料中碳含量的控制就能更加的精確。實驗結果顯示將所採購之新型碳
硫分析儀之功率設定改為兩段式，在較低功率之第一區之電流設定在約 70mA~117mA，而第二區
以平常用來測定總碳量之 175mA，此方法已成功的分辨出脫脂試片中碳黑、石墨或固溶碳之量。
  在合金元素對碳之均質化影響方面，實驗結果顯示 Ni 及 Cu 會與碳互相排斥，導致鐵粉周
圍及多孔區出現高 Ni/Cu 但低碳之相，經 EBSD、金相及微硬度分析首次證實為硬度低之肥粒鐵
區及奧斯田鐵區，因此其機械性質比起具相似成分之鑄鍛件差。以 Thermo-Calc 軟體分析亦顯示
Ni 及 Cu 會與碳互相排斥，與實驗結果相符。
The carbon-sulfur analyzer has been purchased and installed. The methodology of differentiating
the carbon soot and the dissolved carbon has been developed. The results show that this instrument and
the settings can be used to identify the amount of carbon soot, which is left from incomplete debinding,
the dissolved carbon, and the total carbon content in powder metal specimens.
The effect of alloying elements on the homogenization of dissolved carbon and the mechanical
properties was also investigated. The key finding was that nickel and copper, which are the popular
alloying elements in powder metal compacts, have a strong repelling effect on carbon. The results of
the Thermo-Calc analysis also agree with the experimental observations. As sintering proceeded, Ni or
Cu was distributed on the iron powder surface at the early stage through surface diffusion or melting.
The presence of these elements forces carbon to move toward the center region of the powder and the
powder surfaces were thus enriched in Ni or Cu but lean in carbon. Thus, the mechanical properties are
deteriorated. The EBSD analysis confirmed that soft Ni-rich/C-leans ferrite and austenite areas were
present.
KEYWORDS: CARBON ANALYSIS, CARBON SOOT, NICKEL, HOMOGENIZATION,
DIMENSIONAL CONTROL
I. INTRODUCTION
Organic lubricants are frequently added into
metal powders to facilitate compaction in the
conventional press-and-sinter (P/S) process. In
the case of metal injection molding process
(MIM), organic binders are also required to mix
with metal powders during the feedstock
preparation step.[1-6] These organic additives
must be removed prior to sintering. Otherwise,
defects, such as blistering, exfoliation, or
cracking will occur during sintering due to the
fast decomposition of the organic materials at
high temperatures. The debinding process must
also be adequately exercised. Otherwise, carbon
soot will form and dissolve in the iron matrix
and carburize the part when the debinding is
incomplete. On the other hand, decarburization
may also occur when the debinding time is
excessively lengthened. The types of the
lubricants or binders and the atmospheres are
also important factors in determining the final
The setting of 78-117ma was also used to
measure the total amount of carbon and the
amount of graphite in the mixture of 1040
medium carbon steel and ductile cast iron.
However, only one peak was found in all
measurements. This suggested that the amount of
graphite, when embedded in the matrix instead
of in the loose powder form, cannot be
accurately determined. It will show up together
with the dissolved carbon. This is probably
because high power is required to melt the cast
iron in order to detect the graphite. However,
such a high power will also measure the amount
of the dissolved carbon.
Based on the above measurenments, the
optimum current setting for measuring the
carbon soot is at about 90ma.
B. Effect of Nickel on the Carbon Distribution
Carbon is the major alloying element in P/S
and MIM compacts. Its amount, form, and
distribution are also important. It was noticed
that when Ni and Cu were present, the
homogenization of carbon was impeded. The
incomplete homogenization has thus deteriorated
the mechanical properties. A typical
microstructure of sintered FD-0405, as shown in
Fig. 3, consists of ferrite, pearlite, bainite, and
two kinds of Ni/Cu-rich areas, designated here as
Area 1 and Area 2. The Ni, Cu, and Mo mapping
is shown in Fig. 4. It is clear that the Mo is
homogeneously distributed. However, the Ni and
Cu are concentrated in the periphery of the iron
powder. The Ni/Cu-rich Area 1 was formed
mainly by the surface diffusion of the Ni
powders or the spreading of the Cu melt and is
thus observed in the periphery of the iron
powders. The Ni and Cu contents in these areas
are about 4wt% and 2wt%, respectively. The
microhardness of this area was about Hv 140,
which is very soft. The EBSD phase mapping
results, as shown in Figure 5, identify the
Ni/Cu-rich Area 1 as ferrite. Area 2, which is
found near the large pores, contains 6-15wt% Ni
and 4wt% Cu. The high nickel content suggests
that these areas are the sites of the original nickel
powders. The high copper content in these areas
is believed to be the result of the copper melting
during heating and its subsequent dissolution
into the nickel due to their high miscibility. The
microhardness of the Ni/Cu-rich Area 2 is about
Hv 170-260. The phase mapping of EBSD, as
shown in Fig. 6, suggests that these areas also
consist mainly of ferrites. The calculation using
the Thermo-Calc program indicates that Ni and
Cu will increase the chemical potential of carbon.
Thus, the carbon was forced out of the
Ni/Cu-rich areas, such as the powder peripheries.
This calculation explains the formation of the
soft Ni/Cu-rich ferrites at the powder peripheries.
Thus, the homogenization of Ni and Cu must be
improved if the mechanical properties of P/S and
MIM compacts are to be increased. This could be
a good subject for further studies in the future.
Conclusions:
The methods of measuring the amount of
carbon soot and the total carbon have been
developed. The results show that two stage
power inputs could differentiate the amount of
carbon soot or graphite and the dissolved carbon.
The lower power input can be set around 90ma
while the higher power input can be set at 175ma,
which is the standard setting for measuring the
total amount of carbon.
About the effect of nickel on carbon
distribution, it was found that, after 1120℃
sintering, Ni and Cu-rich areas were observed in
diffusion-bonded Fe-4Ni-0.5Mo-1.5Cu steel
compacts. These areas are either located near the
surface of the iron powder or at
pore-concentrated regions. Area 1 contains about
4wt% Ni and 2wt% Cu, while Area 2 contains
about 6-15wt% Ni and 4wt% Cu. Through the
use of EBSD, the phases of these two Ni/Cu-rich
areas are identified as mainly ferrites, not Ni-rich
austenites. These areas are soft and are
responsible for crack initiation during
mechanical testings.

聖地牙哥 2006國際粉末冶金會議紀要
由美國粉末冶金協會所舉辦的國際粉末冶金會議，於 2006 年 6 月在加州的聖地牙哥 Hyatt
飯站舉行，由於當地地點佳、氣候好，所以即使 2006 年九月在韓國將有世界粉末冶金會議，此
次大會仍然吸引了不少專家、學者參加。
會議第一天早上，大會邀請 T. Faranda 先生作一專題演講，講題仍是近年來美國 P/M 業所關
心的大陸 P/M 業及汽車業之發展情形。首先他提出了一些數據說明大陸經濟之成長，並佐以一
些較聳動的比較，例如大陸的建築業的熱度相當於每個月要建立一個相當於休士頓或費城大小的
新市鎮，才能應付目前進入各大城市的新人口，大陸每年所用水泥佔了全世界的 2/5，鋼鐵佔了
1/5，大陸人工成本僅每小時 1.25 美元，而美國為 26 美金，德國為 36 美金等等。大陸在汽車業
方面雖然最近已稍為冷卻下來，但前景仍不錯，相較之下，美國汽車業的 GM 公司每況愈下，
Delphi 等供應商陷入困境，這些仍不易在近期內有所改進。最勁爆的是他說是否曾有人想過有一
天 GM 公司會破產？而且最後被大陸的公司買下？
但 Faranda 也提出在 2008 奧運之後，大陸經濟有可能會有瓦解(melt down)之可能，主要是
因其財產制度、法律制度仍不完整，相較於印度在這方面反而較健全，所以印度反而有可能是須
更受注意的一個國家，10 年內有可能取代中國。
依他的看法，大陸最近採用了下列各種策略以提升其競爭力及影響力，例如利用其廣大之內
需市場，重新建立與國際知名廠商相似之品牌，以省去其使用品牌之費用；進入美國汽車市場；
取代日本在亞洲之地位；利用 WTO 之力量要求各國取消各種進口障礙；建立新品規格，在
HDTV、DVD 等科技產品上以其強大市場作後盾，訂定其自有規格；利用自有規格之現有科技
取得優勢；利用地利之便橫掃亞洲市場等。
Franda 此演講提出了一些數據及其各人看法，但其角度依筆者看仍欠公允，對大陸之了解並
不深入，也難怪會議後大家碰面聊天時的第一個問題是“你的看法如何？”。而此次專題演講的講
題也有待商確，這是因為此會議為國際會議，與會者來自世界二十餘國，講題最好不要以美國的
角度來討論此問題，不然反而有點像是美國國內 P/M 會議了。
之後美國 P/M 協會主席也發表了去年美國 P/M 業之情形，基本上由於(1)整體汽車銷售率之
下滑導致 P/M 業也下滑，(2)美國車相較於日本及德國車在每輛車上 P/M 件之重量多出一倍以
上，所以當美國車市佔率往下掉時，將更導致汽車 P/M 工件之使用量下滑。此外，由於(3)原料
成本上升及(4)生產全球化之趨勢越來越明顯，因此美國整體 P/M 業界越來越辛苦。但此並不表
示美國 P/M 業毫無前景，因美國業者仍擁有相當多的優勢，特別是有非常強的技術基礎及龐大
的產能及市場。
依據美國 P/M 協會之統計，去年美國的鐵粉消耗量為 43.9 萬噸，比前年的 47.4 萬噸掉了約
7%，不銹鋼粉約 9,700 噸，銅粉約 2.4 萬噸，碳化鎢粉約 6,700 噸(因探勘業成長)。金屬射出成
形業成長約 10%，相對地，日本及亞洲地區均呈現成長之趨勢。
在新技術方面，伊利諾州生產 Ti 粉的 ITP 公司報導了其 Armstrong 製程之近況，目前正在
建廠，預計明年即可完成，年產量為 200 萬公斤，而下一步的計畫是再建一年產量為 2500 萬公
斤的 Ti 粉廠。由於筆者常作 MIM 之研發因此亦有興趣，但此粉由於形狀之關係並不適合。

The mechanical properties of Ni-containing powder metal parts are usually inferior to those of their wrought
counterparts. The main problem is attributed to the non-uniform Ni distribution, in addition to the porosity
problems. The effects of this non-uniform alloying on the mechanical properties were investigated in this study
using mini tensile bars that were made of diffusion alloyed FD-0405 (Fe-4Ni-1.5Cu-0.5Mo-0.5C) powders.
In-situ tensile tests were carried out inside the SEM. The results indicated that the soft Ni-rich/C-lean area
around the pore was responsible for the failures. The electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) analysis
identified for the first time that most of these soft Ni-rich areas were ferrites. By adding a small amount of Cr,
these Ni-rich/C-lean ferrites were replaced by bainites and martensites. An example was given by using
prealloyed Fe-3Cr-0.5Mo powder as the base material to prepare the Fe-4Ni-3Cr-0.5Mo-0.5C specimen. After
1250℃ sintering for 1 hour, followed by furnace cooling, the tensile strength thus attained could reach
1323MPa, which could be the highest value reported to date for sinter-hardened compacts. These improvements
were attributed to the homogeneous alloying, particularly the uniform distribution of Ni and C due to the
reduction of the repelling effect between these two elements, as was discussed through the thermodynamics
analysis using the Thermo-Calc program.
INTRODUCTION
Ni-rich areas: ferrites, martensites, and austenites [9]. These reports show that the structure of the Ni-rich areas is
still not clear. Moreover, no structural analysis or other detailed methods for the phase identifications were
revealed in these reports.
Thus, the first objective of this study was to identify the structure of the Ni-rich areas in the sintered FD-0405
steel using the Electron Back Scattered Diffraction (EBSD) method along with the microhardness analysis. The
other objective was to perform an in-situ observation of the fracture behavior under a scanning electron
microscope. The purpose was to find out where the cracks initiate and how they propagate. Additionally, this
study confirms the beneficial effects of chromium addition in terms of improving homogeneity of microstructure
of Ni-containing steels and mechanical strength.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE
The diffusion alloyed FD-0405 (Fe-4Ni-1.5Cu-0.5Mo-0.5C) was used as the base powder in this study. The
characteristics of this powder are listed in Table 1. To prepare the specimens, diffusion alloyed powders were
mixed with 0.6wt% graphite powder and 0.75wt% ethylene bis-stearamide, which is a lubricant. The powder
mixture was compacted into tensile bars as per MPIF standard No. 10. The green density was 6.85g/cm3. The
green compacts were heated at 5℃/min to 550℃ and were held at that temperature for 15minutes to remove the
lubricant. The debound specimens were then heated at 10℃/min to 1120℃ for 30-minute sintering, followed by
furnace cooling. Both debinding and sintering were

RESULTS
Identification of Ni-rich Phases
Figure 2 shows the microstructure of the FD-0405 sample sintered at 1120℃. The center of the powder
contained mainly pearlites and a small amount of ferrites and bainites. The EPMA analysis indicates that the Mo
was distributed uniformly. However, the Ni and Cu were not; they were mostly present at powder peripheries
and in pore-rich regions. This is because the Ni was distributed uniformly first at powder surfaces through
surface diffusion but did not diffuse deep into the iron powder core due to its slow diffusion rate. The copper had
a distribution similar to that of Ni. This is because the Cu could also coat the iron powder uniformly when the Cu
melted at 1083℃. The homogenization was incomplete also due to its slow diffusion rate as compared to that of
Mo.
The contents of the Ni and Cu in the Ni-rich area at powder surfaces were 4wt% and 1.5wt%, respectively. In
contrast, both elements were less than 0.1wt% in the core region of the iron powder. The carbon content was not
uniform either. The center region contained higher amounts of carbon compared to the Ni-rich areas at powder
surfaces, with a ratio of about 6:1. Thus, little lamellae, or feather-like structures, were found at powder surfaces
in the Ni-rich/C-lean areas, while pearlites were found in the center of the powders. (To facilitate the discussion
on phase identifications, this type of Ni-rich area near the powder surface was designated as Ni-rich Area 1.) The
EBSD analysis further confirmed that Ni-rich Area 1 was ferrite, as shown in Figure 3, and the hardness was
about HV140, similar to that of the ferrite in wrought steels.
The second type of Ni-rich areas consisted of those located at the original Ni powder sites. Despite the fact that
Ni has spread out via surface diffusion, the Ni content at the original powder sites was still the highest, between
11-23wt%, as measured by the EPMA. The hardness was between HV170 and HV260. The EBSD analysis, as
shown in Figure 4, indicated that this Ni-rich area was austenite.
The third type of Ni-rich areas, as shown in Figure 2, contained a needle-like microstructure and about 4-8wt%
Ni and 4wt%Cu, as measured by the EPMA. The hardness was between HV420 and HV562, which was similar
to that of the martensite in wrought steels. These martensites were formed even with a slow furnace cooling rate
because of the high Ni and Cu contents and thus the high hardenability.
Crack Propagation
As the tensile stress increased to 269MPa, which was about half of the ultimate tensile strength, cracks started to
initiate at the grain boundaries of Ni-rich Area 1, or Ni-rich ferrites, as shown in Figure 5. Since this area was
quite weak, with a hardness of only HV140, significant plastic deformation occurred
specimen when the applied stress exceeded 420MPa. This type of primary crack was the most frequently seen
pattern among the 10 specimens examined.
The second most frequent propagation route that was noticed ran along the grain boundary between two different
phases, such as between the pearlite and the Ni-rich ferrite, as shown in Figure 6. This could be attributed to the
different hardnesses at the two neighboring grains, which caused dislocation pile-ups at

Fracture Surfaces
Figure 9 shows that fracture surfaces of the compact sintered at 1120℃. The percentages of the ductile areas,
brittle cleavage planes, and pores are 30.2％, 4.3％, and 65.5％, respectively, as shown in Table 2.

cracks start at the sintered necks due to the high degree of stress concentration in these areas [4,13,19,20]. These
cracks then propagate along the high-porosity path. The porosity along the fracture surfaces measured was about
7 to 10 times of that in the bulk. When the fracture did not run along the high-porosity path, the ratio was only
about 2.4 [13]. The ratio calculated in this study was 5.2, which falls between the two extreme numbers reported
by Gething et al. This suggests that the fracture was not 100% along the high porosity path because some powder
cores, such as that consisting of coarse pearlites, are quite weak. Thus, the microstructure still plays an important
role in determining the mechanical properties.
The above microstructural analysis indicated that the elimination of the Ni-rich ferrites near sintered necks and
in pore-rich regions is crucial in improving the mechanical properties. This can be achieved by increasing the
sintering temperature and sintering time, using finer Ni powders, or by adding other alloying elements. For
example, Carabajar et al. added 0.8wt% C in the Fe-4Ni-1.5Cu-0.5Mo and found pearlite at the sintered necks
and at powder cores [10]. Campbel et al. employed 1.5μm Ni powders in FN-0405 (Fe-4Ni-1.0Cu-0.5C) alloy
and noticed significant improvement in the homogenization of Ni [21]. Wu et al. recently reported that the
addition of Cr in the FD-0405 could significantly increase the tensile strength, hardness, and elongation of the
material [9]. After adding 0.5wt% Cr in the form of stainless steel, the tensile strength increased from 626MPa to
801MPa when the compacts were sintered at 1250℃ for 1 hour. This improvement was attributed to the greater
homogeneity of the microstructures, which consisted mainly of martensites and bainites, even around sintered
necks and pore-rich regions. A comparison was made of the tensile strengths reported by the above investigations,
as summarized in Table 3. Although little information on the strengthening mechanism of the materials
investigated was given in these studies, it is clear that the elimination of the Ni-rich ferrites and weak coarse
pearlites is the key to improving the mechanical properties, as demonstrated in this study.

CONCLUSIONS
Most studies on the fracture behavior of sintered Ni-containing steels have been focused on the characteristics of
the pores and the phases present in the compact. However, little direct evidence has been given. In this study,
in-situ tensile tests were conducted on a sintered FD-0405 (Fe-4Ni-1.5Cu-0.5Mo-0.5C) steel inside an SEM. The
following are the conclusions.
1. The in-situ tensile tests indicate that most cracks initiate at the Ni-rich (4%Ni and 1.5%Cu) areas near the
sintered necks and at the pore-rich regions, particularly at the grain boundaries. The cracks then propagate
along the high-porosity path, while some cracks may cross the powder cores, which contain coarse pearlites.
2. The Ni-rich areas where cracks initiate are lean in carbon and contain about 4wt%Ni and 1.5wt% Cu. The
hardness is low, between HV140 and HV160. These areas located at the powder peripheries were verified as
Ni-rich ferrites using the EBSD analysis method. The second Ni-rich area, which contains 11-23wt% Ni and
has a hardness between HV170 and HV260, was identified as Ni-rich austenites. The third Ni-rich area,
which contains 4-8wt% Ni and 4wt% Cu and has a hardness between HV420 and HV562, was identified as
martensite.
3. The uniformity of the Ni distribution influences the mechanical properties of Ni-containing PM steels. Thus,
the elimination of the weak Ni-rich ferrites becomes essential if the properties are to be improved. This can
be achieved by adding Cr. By using Fe-3Cr-0.5Mo prealloyed powder as the base material, the Ni-rich
ferrites in the sintered Fe-3Cr-0.5Mo-4Ni-0.5C were eliminated and replaced by bainites or martensites. The
