一、 摘要 
Phenol-formaldehyde resin bead carbons activated with steam were found 
to exhibit the high-power, low ESR, and highly reversible characteristics 
between –0.2 and 0.8 V in aqueous electrolytes, which were demonstrated to 
be promising electrode materials for supercapacitors. The pore structure of 
these activated carbons was systematically characterized by the t-plot method 
based on N2 adsorption isotherms. Activated carbons prepared through the 
steam activation method under different activation time generally showed 
excellent capacitive performance in aqueous media, mainly attributed to the 
development of both micropores and mesopores (with the average diameter 
ranging from 1.98 to 2.24 nm). Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) 
photographs showed the surface morphologies of cheese. The average specific 
capacitance of the activated carbon with an activation time of 4 h reached 258 
F g−1 between –0.2 and 0.8 V in H2SO4. The capacitive characteristics of 
activated carbons in H2SO4, HNO3, and NaNO3 could be roughly estimated 
from the pore structure and BET surface area and the correlation is applicable 
to the phenol-formaldehyde resin bead activated carbons.

1. Introduction 
Recently, investigations on the porous structures and electrochemical behavior of 
activated carbons in various forms have been carried out because of their use as 
electrode materials for surpercapacitors [1-16]. Since the cost of supercapacitors 
based on activated carbons is low [17], these devices are commercially attractive 
for many applications, such as mobile telecommunictions and starting and 
back-up power for hybrid electric vehicles [18]. On the other hand, for high-power 
purposes, the proportion of mesopores (i.e. pore diameter between 2 and 50 nm) 
within activated carbons is considered to be one of the key determinants of the 
capacitive performance of supercapacitors. This is because a complete array of the 
electric-double layers can be established and solvated ions can move freely within 
such pores. A high ratio of mesopores will, however, result in a loss of specific 
surface-area [12,19]. A large portion of electric energy stored in supercapacitors 
will be consumed during discharge if the equivalent series resistance (ESR) is 
significant, which usually results in a poor conductivity of the activated carbons as 
well as poor diffusion of solvated ions within the micropores [18,20,21]. These 
characteristics depend mainly on the nature, the BET surface-area, and the porous 
structure of carbons [18-22]. Accordingly, pore-size distribution is one of the key 
resin beads were then thermally treated under an oxygen-deficient environment. In 
the oven, it was further heated at the same rate to reach 950 ℃ under the same 
flow-rate of steam. The time for activation at 950 ℃ was varied from 1 to 4 h. The 
samples were classified according to activation time as PF1, PF1.5, PF2, PF3, and 
PF4. The first two characters, PF, represent the phenol-formaldehyde resin beads; 
the last number represents the activation time (hr). 
2.3. Measurements of physical properties 
The physical properties of activated carbons, including the BET surface-area, and 
bulk density, were measured. The yield was calculated as the weight ratio of final 
carbons to the initial dried raw materials. 
The BET surface-area of the carbons (Sp) was obtained from nitrogen adsorption 
isothersms at 77K (Porous Materials, BET-202A). The total pore volume (Vpore) 
and the pore-size distribution were estimated by BJH theory [24], and the 
micropore volume (Vmicro) by means of the t-plot method [25–27]. The surface 
area of micropores (Smicro) was obtained by difference [28]. 
2.4. Electrode preparation 
Activated carbon powders were well mixed with 2 wt.% polyvinylidene difluoride 
(PVdF) binders for 30 min and N-methyl- 2-pyrrolidone (NMP) was dropped into 
the above mixture and ground to form the coating slurry. This slurry was smeared 
on to the pretreated graphite substrates and then dried in a vacuum oven at 50 
℃overnight. In order to avoid any unexpected influences, the total amount of 
activated car bon paste on each electrode was kept approximately constant (ca. 
2mg cm−2). The 10mm×10mm×3mm graphite substrates before coating with 
activated carbons were first abraded with ultrafine SiC paper, degreased with 
acetone and water, then etched in a 0.1M HCl solution at room temperature (ca. 
26 ℃) for 10 min, and finally degreased with water in an ultrasonic bath. The 
exposed geometric area of these pretreated graphite supports is equal to 1 cm2, 
while the other surface areas were insulated with PTFE (polytetrafluorene 
ethylene) coatings. 
2.5. Capacitance measurements 
Electrochemical measurements were performed by means of an electrochemical 
analyzer system, CHI 633A (CH Instruments). All experiments were carried out in 
a three-compartment cell. An Ag/AgCl electrode (Argental, 3M KC1, 0.207 V 
versus SHE at 25 ℃) was used as the reference electrode and a platinum wire with 
an exposed area equal to 4 cm2 was employed as the counter electrode. A Luggin 
capillary was used to minimize errors due to iR drop in the electrolytes. The 
electrolytes used for the capacitive characterization were degassed with purified 
nitrogen gas for 25 min before measurements and this nitrogen was passed over 
the solutions during the measurements. The solution temperature was maintained 
at 25 ◦C by means of a water thermostat (Haake DC3 and K20). 
effect on the outer appearance of resin beads. The photo of Fig. 4(c) and 4(d) are 
the profiles of PF3 and PF4. Beside pores formed during synthesizing reaction, the 
rest formation is dense and the shape is like cheese. 
3.3. Elemental analysis of the chemical properties of activated carbon 
In this study, the chemical compositions of activated carbon obtained from 
elemental analysis are listed in Table 2. PF-raw in Table 2 represents not activated 
synthesizes phenol- formaldehyde resin beads. Its content of element C is 70.9%. 
The content of element C in activated carbon increases with prolonging activation 
time. On the contrary, element O decreases with prolong activation time.   
3.4. Temperature programmed desorption of the chemical properties of activated 
carbon 
Inert gas (He) is introduced through the sample surfaces in temperature 
programmed desorption. Desorption begins as the temperature of sample rises. At 
lower temperatures (＜550℃), CO2 is desorbed because of the existence of 
anhydrides, lactones, and carboxyl; while the desorption of CO occurs at higher 
temperatures (above 500℃) because of the existence of quinine, hydroxyl, and 
carbonyl groups [19,29,30]. Thus distribution of oxygen-containing functional 
groups can be understood with the TPD results. Fig. 5 shows results of the TPD of 
the activated carbon studied in this work. Desorption of PF1 at lower temperatures 
(＜550℃) and at higher temperatures (＞500℃) are the most; PF2, next; PF4, the 
least. This is in accordance with the elements H and O of elemental analysis; PF4 
has the least desorption because of its high loss ratios of H and O. 
3.5. Capacitive characteristics of steam-activated carbons 
Based on the fact that the Dp of steam-activated carbons is located between 1.98 
and 2.24 nm, these carbons should be suitable for supercapacitors. Accordingly, 
the electrochemical behaviour of steam-activated carbons with different tA has 
been measured to demonstrate this unique characteristic. 
Typical results for steam-activated carbons with tA of 1, 1.5, 2, 3, and 4 h 
measured in 1M HNO3 at 20mVs−1 are shown in Fig. 6. There is a pair of wide 
peaks on all curves between 0 and 0.5V. These are attributed to the presence of a 
redox couple in this potential region [19]. In addition, all i–E curves on the 
positive sweeps are symmetical with those on the corresponding negative sweeps, 
which indicates that all carbons show the excellent capacitive property in NaNO3. 
In addition, voltammetric currents gradually increase with the extending activation 
time which can be attributed to the fact that the specific surface of activated 
carbons is increased with tA (see Table 1). 
Typical cyclic voltammograms of activated carbon PF4 measured in 1M NaNO3, 
1M HNO3, and 0.5M H2SO4 are shown in Fig. 7, respectively. The cyclic 
voltammogram of 1M NaNO3 is better symmetrical, while those of 1M HNO3 and 
0.5M H2SO4 has larger areas. 
and BET surface area, while this correlation should be affected not only by the 
activation times but also by the starting materials.
