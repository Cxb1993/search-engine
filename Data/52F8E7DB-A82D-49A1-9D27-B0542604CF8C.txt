Abstract 
 
    We present a novel method for detecting the quantum dots’ (QDs) stability at 
room temperature. The device is fabricated by combining blue InGaN chips with 
luminescent colloidal core-shell CdSe-ZnSe QDs. We design a simple holder to fix 
the SMD-LED for ensuring detected position always the same. Although using the 
QDs as phosphor for the fabrication of LED is more easily, however, the QDs are 
unstable owing to lattice mismatch, photooxidation and thermal aggregation. 
Therefore, we encapsulate QDs into PMMA to protect QDs from oxidation and 
aggregation. By this way we can improve the stability of QDs at room temperature 
which increases the feasibility for replacing the phosphors such as YAG with QDs. 
Finally?we use this technique to fabricate WLED(White Light Emitting Diode)?it not 
only shows the good stability but also exhibits good properties on efficiency and 
purity of white light.

that the XRD pattern for Pt (2 2 0) at ∼ 68◦, because it is isolated
from carbon support graphite diffraction peaks. The shift of the
peak (2 2 0) to higher values of 2θ is attributed to the insertion
of Ru. The lattice parameter of the Pt fcc crystal, a, was cal-
culated from the peak maximum, θmax, according to Vegard’s
law:

(1)
where λkα1 = 1.54056 A˚. The Ru atomic fraction in the alloy,
xRu, was calculated from XRD data using the formula proposed
by Antolini et al. [31]:
a = a0 − 0.124xRu (2)
where a0 is the lattice constant of pure Pt. In the case of sup-
ported pure Pt, a0 = 3.9155 A˚, which was obtained from XRD
measurement of Pt/C (20 wt.% metal loading) made by E-TEK
[31]. Hence, the calculations of a and xRu from Eqs. (1) and
(2) are 3.8597 A˚ and 45%, respectively. The width of the (2 2 0)
peak is also chosen to estimate the grain size of the Pt–Ru nan-
oclusters by the Scherrer equation:
