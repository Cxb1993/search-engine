CHAPTER 1  
INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1 Background 
The working stress design methods are used for a long period in geotechnical 
engineering, and the factor of safety (FS) are typically used to address the 
uncertainties in geotechnical engineering. In the past, the determination of FS is 
usually based on the past engineering experience. Rigorous treatments on the 
quantification of geotechnical uncertainties and the investigation of its influence on 
the practical design are gradually developed. In order to quantify the uncertainties in 
design process, the reliability analysis (RA) and reliability-based design (RBD) are 
gradually employed and applied in practical design. In many countries and areas, the 
reliability-based design codes in terms of load and resistance factor design (LRFD) or 
partial factors design have been developed and used, such as the LRFD design code 
established by American Association of State Highway Transportation Official 
(AASHTO 1994), the Geo-Code 21 developed in Japan (Honjo and Kusakabe 2002), 
the Eurocode 7 (1993) adopted in European, and the Canadian National building code 
used in Canadian (Becker 1996). It may indicate the reliability-based design code is a 
trend in future geotechnical design. However, the load and resistance factors in LRFD 
-based design codes or partial factors in partial factors-based design codes are not all 
rigorously calibrated by reliability analysis. The studies on the reliability-based design 
in geotechnical engineering are still at the beginning stage.  
The limit state design based on the reliability-based concept have been 
developed and applied in structural engineering for a long period. However, the 
working stress design or the factor of safety design is still used in geotechnical 
3 
Terzaghi‟s methods, Bjerrum and Eide‟s method, and slip circle methods may include 
model uncertainties, because model uncertainty is an important concern in the 
development of reliability based design, therefore well-documented case histories are 
collected for the purpose of calibration of model uncertainty. Since the model 
uncertainties are calibrated, reliability-based design charts for basal heave stability in 
deep excavations in clay are established. 
For reliability-based designs for deformations, the maximum wall displacement 
is used as an indicator for the assessment of serviceability limit state in this study. In 
general, the excessive wall displacements in clay dominated ground condition are 
expectable before analysis. In order to reduce the wall displacements in soft clay 
dominated ground conditions, cross walls are recognized to be an efficient way for the 
constraint of wall displacements and successfully used in many practical case in 
Taiwan recently. Thus, in this study, for the purpose of development of a framework 
for reliability assessment of serviceability limit state on wall displacements in deep 
excavations with cross walls. The deep excavation cases with cross walls are collected, 
and in order to reveal the effect of cross walls on the performance wall displacements 
induced by deep excavations, the cases without cross walls are also collected for 
comparison. The observed performance of maximum wall displacements for cases 
with and without cross walls are discussed, and a physical model of the equivalent 
retaining wall system stiffness is proposed based on the mechanism of diaphragm 
walls, cross walls, and lateral supports and is also applicable for the cases without 
cross walls. Furthermore, a regression model that is applicable for cases with and 
without cross walls for assessment of maximum wall displacements in clay is 
developed based on collected case histories. Since the geotechnical uncertainties are 
rarely addressed in serviceability limit state design, therefore with consideration of the 
variability of model input parameters and model uncertainty of the developed 
5 
consideration of the variability of model input parameters and model uncertainty of 
the developed regression model, the reliability-based design charts for serviceability 
limit state design on maximum wall displacements in terms of partial factors are 
established.

proposed for future research work.

problem and high dimension of the uncertain variables. Since the close form solution 
of fP  is almost hard to obtain, the methods by simulation are widely employed for 
the estimation of fP . The most widely used simulation method is Monte Carlo 
simulation (MCS). For MCS, the failure probability can be estimated by the following 
procedures: 
1. Draw samples  Nix i ,1:   from the probability density function f(x) of each 
uncertain variable. 
2. Then, we have  NixG i ,,1),(  . The failure probability Pf is the ratio of failure 
samples  0)( ixG  over the total number of samples N, which is expressed as:

where  E   is the mean value;    is the indicator function,    is 1, if the 
inside statement is true, else is 0. 
The estimation of fP  by MCS, denoted as
MCS
fP  is unbiased. Since the 
uncertain variables are randomly selected from f(x), the estimation of fP  is not a 
fixed number, and is an uncertain variable. The coefficient of variation (c.o.v.) of 
MCS
fP  is derived as:

If an uncertain variable X is lognormal distribution with mean value = X and 
coefficient of variation (c.o.v.) = X, which is denoted as LN(X, X). X in terms of

where Z  is an uncertain variable in standard Gaussian space. If an uncertain variable 
X is uniform distribution with upper bound= a and lower bound= b, denoted as unif(a,

 ( )X a b a Z     (2.8)

Since all uncertain variables are converted into standard Gaussian space Z, the

where the failure domain is defined as  : ( ) 0z g z  . If g1(z) is linear in standard

transformation of coordinate system from z to 'z . To transfer the original coordinate 
and let one of the coordinate coincided with the direction of the vector 

simulation process, which can let the estimation of Pf is not as time-consuming as 
MCS. However, for high dimensional problem, the design points are hard to obtain by 
optimization method. That is the limitation of FORM. By employing the same 
example mentioned previously in Eq. (2.6). The design point of Q and P are found and 
denoted as zQ
*
 and zP
*
. Thus, the limit state function is rewritten as:

where *Q  =

*P =

PPP z . For reliability based design, we need to 
ensure ** PQ  >0 or Q*> P*. By defining Q= 
*Q /Q and P= 
*P /P, then the 
reliability-based design format is expressed as: 
Q Q P P     (2.12) 
If Q is resistance, and P is loading, Q and P are the resistance factor and loading 
factor, therefore Eq. (2.12) is so-called loading and resistance factor design (LRFD). 
If Q and P are not resistance or loading, Q and P are widely named as partial factors, 
and Eq. (2-12) can also be called as partial factors design. The calibration of partial 
factors in this way is based on FORM. The LRFD is a special case of partial factors 
design. Referring to Ching and Phoon‟s study (2011), the partial factors calibrated by 
FORM may be different for different design parameters, e.g., excavation depth, 
excavation width or the coefficient of variation (c.o.v.) of some random variables. To 
address this issue, they proposed a quantile-based approach for calibrating partial 
factors. 
 
2.1.3 Importance sampling method 
Importance sampling method is proposed by Melchers (1989). As discussed in 
MCS, because 
MCS
fP  is a random variable, and in order to get a more accurate 
13 
only fewer samples comparing to MCS are required for obtaining a more accurate 
estimation of fP . 
From theoretical derivation, it revealed that the estimation of fP  by IS method 
is unbiased. The variance of fP  by IS method ( ][
IS
fPVar ) is theoretically derived as:

2.1.4 Subset simulation method 
Subset simulation method is proposed by Au and Beck (2001). As mentioned 
previously, the MCS method required many times of simulations for estimating fP , 
and it is time-consuming especially the corporation with finite element method. For 
first order reliability method (FORM) and importance sampling method (IS), these 
two methods required to estimate design point z
*
 in the process of estimating fP . For 
high dimensional problem, i.e., there are many uncertain variables involved in g(Z) , 
the FORM and IS method will be inefficient for estimating Pf. However, MCS method 
is not restricted to this issue. The subset simulation method (SS) is belonged to the 
updated version of MCS and IS method. This method does not need to estimate 
15 
discussed later. 
3. The same principle applies to the subsequent stages. By following this procedures, 
we can obtain the estimates for P(F0|F1), P(F1|F2), P(F2|F3), P(F3), and 
multiplication of them will yield P(F). 
In the following, the procedures for obtain samples from f(z|Fj) by Metropolis 
algorithm are described as follows: 
For target distribution, f(z|Fj) 
1. initialize z0 sample at any location 
2. Let zc drawn from normal distribution with mean value = z0, and the covariance 
matrix = Σ, denoted as N(z0, Σ), where Σ can be chosen by user.

For SS method, another issue is how to determine the threshold, so that 
P(F)=P(F0|F1)P(F1|F2)P(F2|F3)P(F3)=?×0.1×0.1×0.1. The threshold can be determined 
by adopted the 0.1 sample quantile of  Nizg i ,1:)(   for each layer. Therefore, 
the full SS methods are summarized as follows: 
1. Generate N samples of Z, denoted as  Niz i ,1:1   from standard Gaussian 
space f(z) for the first layer samples, and then take the 0.1 sample quantile of 
 Nizg i ,1:)( 1   as the threshold on the first layer. 
2. Choose the samples from iz1  that )( 1
izg  less than 0.1 quantile of 
 Nizg i ,1:)( 1   to be the mother samples (the total mother samples is N/10, 
17 
describes as follows: 
 
2.2.1 Limit state factor design method 
In the past, the factors of safety (FSs) are used to address the geotechnical 
uncertainty in design. However, those FSs are determined based on the past 
engineering experience, and the geotechnical uncertainties are not treated in more 
rigorous way. Someone may think about that if there exist a equivalence between 
reliability and factor of safety (FS), which can make the RBD easily achieved by FS ? 
Fortunately, Ching (1999) from theoretical derivation and case validation found that it 
exist the equivalence between reliability and factor of safety. Once the equivalence is 
found, the RBD can be achieved through FS, and it is convenient for practical 
application for engineers. The theorem of the equivalence is described as follows: 
Before discussion of the theorem, some symbols need to be defined. Let X and  
be uncertain variables and design variables (e.g., excavation depth, excavation width) 
of a target system. Also let V be the prescribed allowable design range in the  space. 
Let F denotes the failure event:   1,  ZSRF , where  ,ZSR  is called the 
safety ratio, the random version of the classical factor of safety. In this theorem, it is 
assumed without loss of generality that SR[Z,] is positive and the probability density 
function of the uncertainty Z conditioning on , denoted by p(z|) is known.  
Further defining the nominal limit state function SR() is a positive function of . 
An example of SR() is to take SR[Z,] but fix Z at a certain chosen nominal values, 
e.g., their mean values, that is SR[E[Z],]. Therefore, traditional factor of safety FS is 
the same as SR[E[Z],]=SR() where E[Z] is the mean values of uncertain variables. 
The factor of safety approach is to enforce the following constraint in design process: 
       *,  ZESRFS  (2.18) 
where *   1 is the required factor of safety. For reliability-based design is to 
19 
unbiased estimator of *fP , and its coefficient of variation (c.o.v.) is 
   * *1 f fP N P  . When the target failure probability is small, which is usually the 
case, the procedure requires a large number of samples to make the *fP  estimates 
accurate. This is the drawback of MCS. In this case, other reliability methods that are 
efficient for small failure probability can be implemented to obtain the entire 
functional relation between * and *fP . 
Ching (2009) have demonstrated some examples for the application of the limit 
state factor design method and verified the proposed method can perform well in a 
range of cases. 
 
2.2.2 Partial factors design method 
The recently developed RBD codes mostly adopted the partial factors design 
approach, e.g., the load and resistance factor design (LRFD) by AASHTO (American 
Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials), and Eurocode 7 adopted 
in European. In the framework of the first order reliability method, it provides a way 
for calibrating partial factors. However, the partial factors calibrated from design 
point in the framework of FORM for a combination of design variables may not have 
a good reliability performance on other combination of design variables. Nonetheless, 
Ching and Phoon (2011) proposed a quantile-based approach for the calibration of 
partial factors, which address the issue as mentioned in FORM. In the following, a 
quantiled-based approach for calibrating partial factors proposed by Ching and Phoon 
(2011) is presented. 
Let mZ R  be a collection of random variables (or random vector) and nR   
be a collection of design parameters (or design vector) of the system of interest. For 
21 
Phoon (2011) to address this issue. They use a single factor to scale all partial factors 
in a rational way that is so-called probability threshold  to achieve so: the scaled i-th 
variable 
iz
  is forced to be the  quantile ( is small) of 
iZ  if iZ  is a stabilizing 
factor (e.g., strength) and to be its 1- quantile if iZ  is a destabilizing factor (e.g., 
loading). The same probability threshold  is applied to all random variables. This 
would ensure that all random variables have the same exceedance/non-exceedance 
probability over the corresponding quantiles. 
The  quantiles for some popular distribution models are listed as follows (   
and   denote the mean value and coefficient of variation (c.o.v.); [a, b] denote the 
bound for the uniform distribution; -1 is the inverse cumulative density function 
(CDF) of the standard Gaussian distribution): 
Gaussian:  1z         (2.25)

Gumbel:   0.45 0.7797 log logz                (2.28) 
By the defining ci i iz z

   1 ,..., , , 1T cmSR z z SR z        (2.29) 
The additional step ci i iz z
  is theoretically inconsequential, but practically 
meaningful because engineers are more familiar with partial factors than quantiles. 
The functional relation between the pair *, fP    can be obtained through Eq. (2.24) 
by carrying out Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). Once the functional relation of 
23 
make the *fP  estimates accurate. This is the drawback of MCS. In this case, other 
reliability methods that are efficient for small failure probability can be implemented 
to obtain the entire functional relation between   and *fP . 
 
2.3 Reliability assessment of basal heave stability 
The instability of basal heave may lead to large wall displacement, ground 
settlements and even serious collapse of retaining wall system. Actually, the design of 
basal heave in deep excavations in clay is an important concern. 
Goh et al. (2008) investigated the relation between factor of safety (FS) and 
failure probability for commonly used design methods in wide excavations and deep 
excavations. From reliability analysis, they found the relation of FS versus failure 
probability for Terzaghi‟s (1943) and modified Terzaghi‟s method, as well as Bjerrum 
and Eide‟s (1956) and Eide et al‟s (1972) methods under different c.o.v of undrained 
shear strength are depicted in Fig. 2.2 and Fig. 2.3, respectively. From Fig. 2.2 and 
Fig. 2.3, Goh. et al. (2008) highlighted that the same FS may have different reliability 
level, and for the same demand of failure probability, higher c.o.v. of undrained shear 
strength, the larger FS is required. However, there is a strange phenomenon in those 
figures that the failure probability corresponding to the commonly used FSs in basal 
heave design are quite high, especially the c.o.v. of undrained shear strength is always 
large as investigated by Phoon (1995). But in reality, the commonly used FSs ranging 
from 1.2-1.5 in basal heave design are safe for most cases by past experience. Is this 
discrepancy due to the spatial averaging not taken into account or those methods 
existing model bias ? These issues will be addressed and discussed in this study.

The coefficients of Eq. (2.30) are :bo = -13.41973; b1 = -0.49351; b2 = -0.09872; b3 = 
0.06025; b4 = 0.23766; b5 = -0.15406; b6 = 0.00093; b7 = 0.00285; b8 = 0.00198. 
The capital Y in Eq. (2-31) is expressed as: 
Y= t(y) = a1y
2
+a2y+a3 (2-32) 
where y=each of input variables [
eH ; ln(EI/whavg
4
); B/2; '/u vs   and 
'/i vE  ]; and 
Y=transformed variable. The coefficients of a1,a2 and a3 for each input variables and 
its applicable range are listed in Table 2.1. Kung et al. (2007) further define a 
deflection reduction factor K for considering the effect of presence of hard stratum, 
which is expressed as a function of D/B: 
K= 1.5(D/B)+0.4  for D/B0.4 (2-33a) 
K=1  for D/B>0.4 (2-33b) 
where D is measured from the excavation level to hard stratum. In the case of 
D/B0.4, the estimated hm  by Eq. (2.31) need to be multiplied a reduction factor K 
for modification. 
The model uncertainty of the proposed regression model is calibrated through real 
case histories, and is quantified by a bias factor BF, which is defined as the ratio of 
observed hm  over estimated hm  by Eq. (2.31) and Eq. (2.33). The calibrated 
results showed that BF can be approximately modeled by a normal distribution with 
mean value= 1, and standard deviation =0.25. 
 
2.5 Methods for reducing excavation-induced wall displacements and ground 
settlements 
The excessive wall displacements and ground settlements are expectable for deep 
excavations in soft ground conditions. Since larger wall displacements and ground 
27 
Unlike the steel struts and concrete floor slabs employed as lateral supports in 
traditional bottom-up and top-down construction methods, before excavation, the 
cross walls connecting two opposite walls are constructed and served as struts during 
excavation process. Therefore, the cross walls for the function of reducing wall 
displacements would be efficient. For some cases, as the similar configuration as 
buttress walls, cross walls may extend above the excavation level, and as excavation 
proceeds, the cross walls will be dismantled to the excavation level. During 
excavation process, the high axial stiffness of cross walls can directly reduce the 
excavation-induced wall displacements at the place where cross walls exist. The cross 
walls also exhibit the similar behavior of the corner effect of diaphragm walls which 
is verified through case histories (Ou et al. 2011) and three dimensional numerical 
simulations (Lin 2010). In summary, the function of cross walls applied in deep 
excavation is to provide high axial stiffness for reducing walls displacement, and the 
corner effect will also facilitate for the control of wall displacements. Therefore, a site 
with longer excavation length, the cross walls can be used to divide the site into 
several subzones, and corner effect can facilitate the constraint of wall displacements. 
In some practical applications, the buttress walls are constructed between cross walls 
for the purpose of reducing wall displacements. 
Lin (1999) successfully simulated the wall displacements behavior for deep 
excavations with cross walls by using three-dimensional finite element program 
CUT3D. Further investigation on the parametric study, she pointed out that cross 
walls extending to the ground surface have more effect on the reduction of wall 
displacements than that of extending to the bottom of retaining walls, and the smaller 
spacing of cross walls, the smaller wall displacements would be obtained. Ou et al. 
(2010) proposed a simplified model for predicting wall displacements with cross 
walls by two-dimensional finite element method and is validated by comparing with

CHAPTER 3  
RELIABILITY-BASED DESIGN FOR BASAL HEAVE STABILITY 
OF DEEP EXCAVATIONS IN SPATIALLY VARYING SOILS 
 
3.1 Introduction 
The safety factor (FS) is traditionally used in geotechnical society to account for 
uncertainties in designs. These FSs are usually not based on rigorous analysis but on 
experiences and engineering judgments. Recently, the geotechnical design paradigm 
tends to shift towards reliability-based design (RBD) methods. For instance, the pile 
design methods in the AASHTO code (AASHTO 1994) and the geotechnical design 
methods in Eurocode7 (Eurocode7 1993) are more or less based on reliability 
concepts. Despite this trend, the research regarding geotechnical reliability is still in 
its beginning stage, and many related subjects need to be clarified. 
A fundamental problem in deep excavations is the basal stability. In the regard of 
RBD for basal stability, Goh et al. (2008) calculated the relation between the required 
FS and target failure probability ( *fP ) by using stability models proposed by Terzaghi 
(1943) and Bjerrum and Eide (1956) and by using the first order reliability method 
(FORM). The recommended *fP  is in the range of 10
-2
-10
-3
 for basal stability. 
According to their analysis results, the required FS was close to 2.0 for the scenario 
where the coefficient of variation (c.o.v.: standard deviation divided by mean value) 
of undrained shear strength is 0.2 and target failure probability is 10
-2
. For the case 
where the c.o.v. is more than 0.2, the required FS would further increase to a value 
that is much larger than the FS of 1.5, required in code (JSA 1988). It is worthwhile to 
study the cause for this discrepancy. 
Vanmarke (1977) indicated that the variability of soil properties averaged over a 
31 
due to the averaging effect will be investigated through reliability theories. 
Aside from basal stability of deep excavation, there were already studies on the 
impact of spatial variability in foundation and slope engineering. Fenton and Griffiths 
(2002) investigated the influence of spatial variability of soil properties on settlements 
of foundations. Fenton and Griffiths (2003) and Griffiths and Fenton (2004) 
conducted other similar research on bearing capacities of shallow foundations and on 
slope stability, respectively. Popescu et al. (2005) found that the c.o.v. and probability 
model of soil shear strength are the two main factors affecting bearing capacity and 
differential settlement. Cho (2007) investigated the influence of spatial variability on 
failure probabilities of slopes. 
 
3.2 Stationary random field and averaging effect 
Spatial variabilities of soil properties are usually modeled by random fields. Due 
to stronger correlation of soil properties in the horizontal direction (Phoon 1995), only 
the variability with depth is considered in this study and is modeled as a one 
dimensional random field. Among random field models, stationary random fields are 
widely used due to their simplicity. A one dimensional stationary random field )(z  
can be characterized by its mean value, c.o.v. and auto-correlation function. 
 
3.2.1 Auto-correlation function 
The auto-correlation function of a stationary random field )(z  is defined to the 
correlation between two locations with distance of z : 
))(var())(var(
))(),((
))(),(()(
zzz
zzzCOV
zzzz





  (3.1) 
where z  is the interval of interest; var(.) denotes variance; COV(.,.) denotes 
covariance. The most popular auto-correlation model is the single exponential model 
33 
According to Vanmarcke (1977), scale of fluctuation (SOF) is used to measure 
the distance within which the soil property shows relatively strong correlation from 
point to point. At two points that lie within SOF, the corresponding values are likely 
to be either both above or both below the mean value. SOF is closely related to the 
average distance between intersections of soil property and its mean value. Small SOF 
implies rapid fluctuations about the mean value, while large SOF implies slow 
fluctuations about the mean value. 
The averaging effect can also be interpreted with the number of equivalent 
independent samples over an interval, described as follows. It is well known that the 
variation of the average of N independent samples is 1/N of the variation of a single 
sample. Therefore, if there are N “equivalent” independent samples over an interval 
z , )(
2
zu   
equals 1/N. Since SOF is the length scale over which the soil 
properties are highly correlated, it can be interpreted as there is exactly a single 
equivalent independent sample. According to the above definition, the variance 
reduction factor can be expressed as: 
2 1( ) vu
v
z
z z


   
 
 (3.5) 
where v  is the vertical SOF. From Eq. (3.5), it is clear that the variability of 
averaged soil properties is less for small SOF than for large SOF. This is because the 
cancellation of fluctuations during averaging process is more pronounced for small 
SOF than for large SOF. 
 
3.3 Slip circle method 
Before the details of the analysis steps are presented, it is necessary to first 
introduce the slip circle method for basal stability. The steps for simulating the 
non-stationary random fields for the undrained shear strength profile will be presented 
35 
shear strength, unit weight and surcharge pressure are the main uncertainties in this 
model. The design parameters may include the excavation depth (He) and wall 
embedment depth (Hd), as shown in Fig. 3.1. The distance between the lowest lateral 
supports to the excavation level is set to be 3 m in this study based on engineering 
practice. 
 
3.4 Modeling of random variables and random fields for basal stability 
The key step for the subsequent RBD analysis is the simulation of the random 
variables and random fields for the slip circle model. This section will be devoted to 
describe the detailed steps for the simulations. The undrained shear strength profile, 
unit weight and surcharge are the main random parameters affecting the basal stability 
in clay. 
 
3.4.1 Simulation of unit weight and surcharge pressure 
The variability of unit weight is relatively small compared to that of undrained 
shear strength. Therefore, the spatial variability in unit weight is not taken into 
account in the subsequent analysis for simplicity. Nonetheless, the unit weight is still 
considered to be uncertain and is modeled by the lognormal distribution. Once a 
sample of unit weight is obtained, a sample profile of the effective overburden 
pressure )(
' zv  can be accordingly obtained. The surcharge is also modeled by the 
lognormal distribution due to its non-negativeness. 
 
3.4.2 Simulation of the profile of normalized undrained shear strength 
For most of the normally consolidated clays, the undrained shear strength tends 
to increase with depth. As a consequence, it cannot be modeled by stationary random 
37 
1 and c.o.v. =   [  is also the c.o.v. of )()(
' zzs vu  ]. It should be noted that the 
SOF of )(zq  is conceptually the same as that of the undrained shear strength. 
 The spatial correlation of )(zq  can be described by its auto-correlation 
function: 
( ( ), ( ))
( ) ( ( ), ( ))

   
  
 (3.8) 
The commonly used auto-correlation function is the single exponential model (Eq. 
(3.2)). In this study, lognormal random field samples of )(zq  are obtained by first 
simulating normal random field samples of )](log[ zq  and then taking their 
exponentials. The mean value, c.o.v. and auto-correlation function of )](log[ zq  are 
different from those of )(zq . The mean value, c.o.v. and auto-correlation function of 
)](log[ zq  can be derived (derivations not shown in this dissertation) and are herein 
summarized as follows:


 (3.11) 
 Given the above mean value, c.o.v. and auto-correlation function, the simulation 
of )](log[ zq  can be easily done by the following equation: 
39 
According to the field and laboratory data compiled by Phoon (1995), the c.o.v. of the 
inherent variability is about 0.3 for undrained shear strength and is about 0.1 for unit 
weight. These values are implemented in this study for RBD. 
 
3.4.4 Simulation of the resisting moment Mr 
The resisting moment is the integration of shear strength along the slip circle 
multiplied by r . Since the spatial variability in the horizontal direction is ignored, the 
properties of the soils at the same elevation are identical, even they are at the two 
different sides of the wall. Therefore, it is only necessary to simulate the undrained 
shear strength profile at one side of the wall. It is decided to simulate the shear 
strength behind the wall: the slip circle behind the wall is divided into 100 small arcs 
of equal lengths (as shown in Fig. 3.2), and the resisting moment is simply the 
summation of the two folds of the resisting moment provided by arc bc and that 
provided by arc cg (see Fig. 3.2). 
For each small arc, its undrained shear strength is taken to be the sampled value 
at the middle of the arc. Local averaging (Fenton and Vanmarcke 1990) of the 
undrained shear strength is not considered for these small arcs because their lengths 
are far less than the scale of fluctuation. Samples of 100 normalized undrained shear 
strengths are simulated at the middle points of the 100 small arcs as the first step, and 
they are then multiplied by the sample profile of the effective overburden pressure 
)(' zv  to obtain the samples of the undrained shear strengths of the 100 small arcs. 
The sample of the resisting moment can then be computed as follows:

where ius ,  is the sampled value of the undrained shear strength at the middle for the 
41 
As a demonstration, the samples of the non-stationary undrained shear strength 
)(zsu  of various SOFs are shown in Fig. 3.3. The parameters used to generate the 
samples in Fig. 3.3 are as follows: the mean value   and c.o.v. of the normalized 
undrained shear strength are 0.22 and 0.3, respectively; the mean value and c.o.v. of 
the unit weight are 19 kN/m
3
 and 0.1, respectively; the water table is 2 m below the 
ground surface; the vertical SOFs considered in Fig. 3.3 are 0.5 m, 2.5 m and 10 m. It 
is clear that the fluctuation of the sampled )(zsu  is more severe for a smaller SOF, 
i.e., more independent samples, and the fluctuation is less severe for a larger SOF, i.e., 
less independent samples. 
The influence of SOF to the statistics of the sampled resisting moment is 
demonstrated in the histograms shown in Fig. 3.4, which shows the histograms of the 
sampled resisting moment for SOF of 2.5 m and 10 m. For SOF of 2.5 m, the mean 
value of the sampled resisting moment is 164760 kN-m, and its c.o.v. is 0.225; for 
SOF of 10 m, the mean value is 164660 kN-m, and its c.o.v. is 0.27. Both are less than 
the inherent c.o.v. of the undrained shear strength, but the former is even smaller. This 
is because for a smaller SOF, the independent samples involved in the integration of 
Eq. (3.13) are more, inducing more averaging effect. Hence the variability of the 
resisting moment for a smaller SOF is less. However, the mean value of the sampled 
resisting moment does not seem to vary with different SOFs. 
 
3.5.2 Comparisons to the previous study 
Before the effect of spatial variability is formally taken into consideration, a 
preliminary analysis is conducted to compare the results of the current study with the 
conclusions made by Goh et al. (2008). Because Goh et al. (2008) investigated RBD 
of basal stability without considering the increase-over-depth trend of su and without 
considering random feilds, the compasrison will be made for the cases where the 
43 
variability and the increase-over-depth trend of undrained shear strength. The single 
exponential model is adopted as the auto-correlation model. In the following 
discussion, the default settings are adopted as follows: the mean value of normalized 
undrained shear strength is 0.22 [according to the conclusion from Mesri and Huvaj 
(2007), the average value of 'vus   
is roughly 0.22 for the mobilized undrained 
shear strength, which is equal to the average of the triaxial compression, direct simple 
shear and triaxial extension modes for inorganic soft clay and silt deposits regardless 
plasticity index.] and the c.o.v. is 0.3; the SOF is 2.5 m; the mean value of unit weight 
is 19 kN/m
3
, and the c.o.v. is 0.1; the mean value of surcharge is 10 kPa/m, and the 
c.o.v. is 0.2: ground water table is 2 m below the ground surface; excavation depth (He) 
is 20 m; wall embedment depth (Hd) is 24 m. These default settings are summarized in 
Table 3.1; those are based on the most typical range of inherent variability concluded 
by previous studies and typical construction condition in deep excavations in Taiwan. 
In the sensitivity analysis in the next section, the default settings will be adjusted. 
All RBD results will be presented in the format of *fP  vs. required FS relation 
that is determined by the theory proposed by Ching (2009) implemented by a large 
sample size (N=10
5
) of Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). Again, the method proposed 
by Ching (2009) requires the ability of simulating Mr and Md samples, which has been 
discussed in the previous sections. 
 
3.6.1 Sensitivity analysis 
Further efforts are taken to investigate the sensitivity of some important 
parameters over the results of RBD, namely the relation between *fP  and required FS. 
These important parameters include the (a) SOF, (b) location of ground water table, (c) 
wall embedment depth and (d) mean value of soil unit weight. The list order of the 
45 
because the deeper the wall embedment depth, the larger the radius of the slip circle, 
hence the extent of spatial averaging is larger, and more pronounced averaging effect 
is revealed. The consequence is that the variability of Mr is reduced, and the required 
FS becomes smaller. 
 
3.6.2 The recommended range of required FS 
In general, the required safety factor calibrated by the theory proposed by Ching 
(2009) may vary slightly for different design dimensions, i.e., excavation and wall 
embedment depths. In practice, the excavation depth for common cases ranges from 
10 m to 20 m, and the wall embedment depth ranges from 0.5 to 2.0 times of the 
excavation depth. Within these ranges, the calibrated required safety factor is not 
unique and can be summarized as a lower-upper bound. For the ease of 
implementation, the bounds are provided for *fP  of 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001, and they are 
summarized for various combinations of the parameters found to be infuential in the 
sensitivity analysis, including SOF, mean value of unit weight and ground water table 
location. The parameters that are insensitive to the RBD results, e.g., the mean value 
of the normalized undrained shear strength, are fixed at their default values. As these 
recommended bounds for FSs are developed, the c.o.v. of undrained shear strength is 
chosen to be 0.3 [the average value summarized by Phoon (1995)] and that of the 
surcharge is chosen to be 0.2 [in accordance to Goh et al. (2008)]. The estimation of 
the bounds for FSs are all based on the slip circle method and the theory proposed by 
Ching (2009). Also, the increase-over-depth trend of the undrained shear strength is 
modeled by the non-stationary random field for the development of the bounds. 
For clarity, the bounds of the required FSs are presented in four figures (Figs. 
3.7-3.10) for four selected values of SOF: 0.5, 2.5, 5, 10 m. Each figure presents the 
47 
target failure probability according to Figs. 3.7-3.10. 
Suppose a site is excavated to 20 m deep; laboratory tests reveal that the soil unit 
weight is on average 19 kN/m
3
 and that the normalized undrained shear strength is on 
average 0.25 (these values are taken to be the nominal values); the water table is 2 m 
deep. For the demonstration of RBD, *fP  of 0.01 is prescribed in this design example. 
With the lack of the spatial data of undrained shear strength, SOF of 2.5 m is adopted 
as the nominal value according to the average value summarized by Phoon (1995). 
From site investigation, 10 kPa/m is taken to be the nominal value of the surcharge. 
Because the adopted SOF is 2.5 m, Fig. 3.8 is employed to find the bound for the 
required FS. Given that the nominal unit weight is 19 kN/m
3
 and that the water table 
is 2 m deep, the corresponding bound for *fP  of 0.01 is 1.45-1.61. The nominal FS 
for the slip circle method can be expressed as

1. This study employs non-stationary random fields to model the 
increase-over-depth undrained shear strength and employs the slip circle method 
to realistically consider the impact of soil spatial variability on the RBD of basal 
stability. The resulting required FSs were summarized in figures. When the effect 
of spatial variability is ignored, the calibrated required FSs are similar to those 
obtained by Goh et al. (2008). 
Owing to the averaging effect, the SOF is a key parameter that affects the 
required FSs. It is important to take spatial variability into consideration because 
natural soils are always spatially variable. Comparions show that when spatial 
variability is taken into consideration, the calibrated required FS is closer to the 
ones used in engineering practice and also closer to the ones recommended in 
codes. When the effect of spatial variability is ignored, the calibrated required 
FSs seem over-conservative. 
2. Besides SOF, the analysis results reveal that the location of water table, mean 
value of unit weight, and wall embedment depth are also influential on the 
required FSs. When the water table is deeper, the mean value of unit weight is 
larger, and when the wall embedment depth is larger, the calibrated required FSs 
are less. A series of design figures are provided in this study for engineers to 
easily find the required FS for different levels of *fP . 
3. According to the database summarized by Phoon (1995), the c.o.v. of undrained 
shear strength is on average 0.3, and SOF is on average 2.5 m. Under this 
condition, the calibrated required FSs are in the range of 1.4-1.9 and 1.6-2.4 for 
*
fP  of 0.01 and 0.001, respectively. If the effect of spatial variability is ignored, 
the calibrated required FSs are in the range of 2.1-2.4 and 2.6-3.2, respectively. It 
is clear that the former is closer to the FSs used in engineering practice and those

CHAPTER 4  
CALIBRATION OF MODEL UNCERTAINTIES FOR BASE 
HEAVE STABILITY OF WIDE EXCAVATIONS IN CLAY 
 
4.1 Introduction 
The most widely used design equations for the base heave stability of deep 
excavations are those proposed by Terzaghi (1943), Bjerrum and Eide (1956) and the 
slip circle method (JSA 1988, TGS 2001). These equations are based on simplified 
assumptions which facilitate the calculation of closed-form factors of safety (FS), but 
these assumptions may introduce some systematic bias. Hashash and Whittle (1996) 
reported that Terzaghi‟s and Bjerrum and Eide‟s methods are less conservative than 
the MIT-E3 model in deep clay deposits. Ukritchon et al. (2003) and Faheem et al. 
(2003) reported that wall stiffness and soil-wall interaction significantly affect base 
stability but are not considered in Terzaghi‟s, Bjerrum and Eide‟s and slip circle 
methods; other important factors not considered in the simplified design equations are 
the staged construction sequence and system stiffness of wall-retaining system. The 
effect of these simplifications on the computed FS is currently not well understood 
but is important in the context of reliability based design (RBD). 
 Goh et al. (2008) have considered the use of both Terzaghi‟s and Bjerrum and 
Eide‟s design equations for RBD and, without considering the possibility of 
systematic bias, concluded that the required FS to achieve a failure probability of 
0.001 was larger than 2.0. This value is high compared to the value of 1.5 and 1.2 
typically used in design codes for Terzaghi‟s and Bjerrum and Eide‟s methods, 
respectively (JSA 1988). Wu et al. (2010) considered the impact of spatial variability 
in soil shear strengths and found that the required FS was in the range of 1.6-2.4, 
which again is higher than the recommended design code of 1.5. Wu et al. (2010) also 
53 
base heave analyses are based on the construction stage immediately before failures, 
while for the non-failure cases, the analyses are based on the final construction stage, 
except for case 7 where only the documented information is only available up to the 
fourth stage. 
The excavation depths (He), wall embedment depths (Hd) and excavation widths 
(B) of the fifteen real case histories are in the range of 5.5-19.7 m, 1.0-23.7 m and 
4.6-62 m, respectively. For most cases, the total wall length (Hw) equals He + Hd. 
There are exceptions (cases 2, 11, 12 and 15) where the ground surface behind the 
wall is not level with the top of the wall, so Hw may not equal He + Hd. For these cases, 
He is taken to be the distance between the excavation base to the ground surface. For 
many cases, the excavation lengths (L) are unknown. However, based on the available 
information, most of these cases are judged to be close to plane strain condition. In 
Table 4.1, D is the distance between the excavation base and the hard stratum, and Hs 
is the distance between the lowest lateral supports and excavation base, which are 
needed for the following stability analysis. 
For the fifteen real cases, the undrained shear strengths were tested based on 
various types of tests, including UC (unconfined compression), CK0UC (traxial K0 
consolidated undrained compression), CK0UE (traxial K0 consolidated undrained 
extension), DSS (direct simple shear), FV(field vane) and CPT (cone penetration test), 
which are denoted by su(UC), su(TC), su(TE), su(DSS), su(FV) and su(CPT), 
respectively. The in-situ mobilized su may be different from the tested su value since su 
typically depends on stress state, strain rate, sampling disturbance, etc. Based on the 
available information, the mobilized su [denoted by su(mob)] is estimated from the 
above tested values by following the methods described in Table 4.2. In Table 4.2, 
strain rate corrections are taken to su(TC), su(TE) and su(DSS): t is the correction 
factor for strain rate effect, which is summarized by Kulhawy and Mayne (1990) as 
55 
averaging. The average soil parameters along arcs will be mentioned as “arc-average”, 
e.g., bdeus  is the arc-average su along bde. 
The recommended FS in codes is 1.5 for Terzaghi‟s method (JSA 1988). For 
practical purposes, Terzaghi‟s method may be suitable for wide excavation cases, 
because extension of the failure surface to the ground surface is assumed. The 
recommended FS in codes for Bjerrum and Eide‟s method is 1.2 (JSA 1988). 
Compared to Terzaghi‟s equation where extension of the failure surface to the ground 
surface is assumed, Bjerrum and Eide‟s equation seems more reasonable. The 
recommended FS is 1.2 for the slip circle method (JSA 1988; TGS 2001). 
 
4.4 Mean value of FSC for all case histories 
The calculated factors of safety FSC for various design equations are functions of 
arc-average soil parameters. Therefore, FSC is uncertain because arc-average soil 
parameters are uncertain. The mean value of FSC, denoted by 
CFS
 , can be readily 
evaluated by replacing the arc-average su and unit weights in Eqs. (4.15), (4.17) and 
(4.20) with their mean values and by replacing sq  by its nominal value. The 
surcharge pressure qs is hard to estimate and is usually not mentioned in the collected 
case histories except for case 2 where the 5kPa of surcharge pressure is mentioned. 
For other cases, the design surcharge pressure qs = 10kPa is adopted because it is 
commonly used for the design of base heave stability. From sensitivity analysis, the 
nominal surcharge pressure in the range of 5-20 kPa is found to have insignificant 
effect on the analysis results, so a value of 5 kPa and a typical value of 10 kPa for 
case 2 and other cases respectively for design surcharge pressure ( sq  in Table 4.4) is 
adopted in this study. 
The mean value of the arc-average su(mob) is estimated based on the

P and Q respectively depend on soil unit weight and undrained shear strength. Since 
no relevant literature showing there is noticeable correlation between soil unit weight 
and undrained shear strength, the independence assumption among them may be 
appropriate. By further assuming lognormality for both P and Q and independence 
between P and Q, the c.o.v. of FSC, denoted by 
CFS
 , can be estimated by the 
following equation: 
    2 2exp log 1 log 1 1CFS Q P              (4.5)  
Furthermore, FSC is also lognormal. As a consequence, 
CFS
  depends on  Q  and 
 P , which in turn depend on  bdeus ,  abus ,  ab   and  sq . The 
estimation of  bdeus ,  abus  and  ab   deserves further discussion. For the 
estimation of  ab  , the same principle holds. 
In Eq. (4.2), the two arc-average su 
bde
us  and 
ab
us  may be positively correlated 
because of the existence of vertical correlation, although they are assumed to be 
uncorrelated in the above analysis. According to Phoon (1995), the vertical scale of 
fluctuation for undrained shear strength ranges from 0.8 m to 6.0 m. In the extreme 
case where the scale of fluctuation is 0.8 m, the correlation between bdeus  and 
ab
us  
can be neglected without much error. However, in the other extreme where the scale 
59 
2 2 2
i i m m tR R       
 
(4.6) 
where i  is the c.o.v. of (point-wise) inherent variability of su; iR  is the variance 
reduction factor for the along-arc averaging; m  is the c.o.v. of measurement error; 
mR  is the variance reduction factor for measurement errors; t  is the c.o.v. of 
transformation uncertainty if transformation equations are required to convert tested 
values (e.g., field vane and CPT) to su values. For the arc-average unit weights, their 
c.o.v.s can be estimated by using the same formula. 
 
4.5.1 Estimation of the c.o.v. of arc-average su 
Estimation of m  and i  
As stated above, the observed variability in the su data points is composed of the 
point-wise inherent variability in su (with c.o.v. = i ) and the measurement error for 
su (with c.o.v. = m ). Although it is impossible to separately estimate i  and m  
from the observed variability, certainly that m  is less than the c.o.v. of the observed 
variability. The ranges and average values of c.o.v.s for the measurement error for 
various types of su tests, as documented by Phoon (1995), are listed in Table 4.6. 
Since m  cannot be larger than the c.o.v. of the observed variability, it can be 
roughly estimated to be the closest value in Table 4.6 that is also smaller than the 
observed c.o.v. For instance, in case 6, the c.o.v. of the observed variability is 0.54 
(see the second column in Table 4.5), and the su test type for case 6 is the CU test. 
From Table 4.6, it is known that the upper, mean and lower c.o.v. values for the CU 
measurement errors are 0.05, 0.15 and 0.40, respectively. Among the three c.o.v. 
values, 0.40 is closest to and smaller than 0.54, and therefore 0.40 is taken to be a 
rough estimate of m  for case 6. Once this m  estimate is obtained, i  can be 
found by 
61 
 As stated above, only a fraction of i  propagates into the c.o.v. of the 
arc-average su due to spatial averaging. The variance reduction factor iR  can be 
estimated by actually simulating random fields of su profiles along the arcs and 
conducting averaging there. The same simulation techniques described in Chapter 3 
are employed in this study for the purpose, with the assumption that the vertical scale 
of fluctuation for su is 2.5m, the average scale of fluctuation for su summarized in 
Phoon (1995). The estimated iR  value is simply the variance of the simulated 
arc-average su divided by the inherent variance of su. Note that the variance reduction 
factors iR  are different for the three design equations because the assumed failure 
surfaces (i.e., the arcs) are different. 
 The estimated iR  are also listed in Table 4.7 for all 15 cases and for all three 
design equations, and the relation between iR  and the extent of spatial averaging is 
shown in Fig. 4.3. The so-called extent of spatial averaging is defined differently for 
the three design equations: for modified Terzaghi‟s equation, the extent is dT for 
bde
us  
and is He for 
ab
us ; for Bjerrum and Eide‟s equation, the extent is dT for 
cdef
us ; for the 
slip circle equation, the extent is r (circle radius) for cbdeus . 
Estimation of t 
 For cases 4 and 5, the su(mob) profiles are estimated based on the results of field 
vane (FV), while for case 15, the su(mob) profile is estimated based on the CPT 
results. For these cases, there are transformation uncertainties in the estimated 
su(mob). For the other cases, t  are taken to be zeros because su(mob) is directly 
from laboratory undrained shear strength tests. There is no consensus on how to 
estimate t for FV results to su(mob). In this study, the c.o.v. of the correction factor 
  (see method 4 in Table 4.2) of the historical data discussed in Bjerrum (1972) is 
63 
4.6 Resulting mean values and c.o.v.s of FSC for all cases 
Based on the mean values and c.o.v.s of all input parameters summarized in 
Tables 4.4 and 4.8, the mean values of FSC (
CFS
 ) for all cases can then be obtained 
by substituting the input parameters listed in Table 4.4 into Eqs. (4.15), (4.17) and 
(4.20), while the c.o.v.s of FSC can be obtained by applying Eqs. (4.2)-(4.5) with the 
c.o.v.s listed in Table 4.8. The resulting mean values and c.o.v.s of FSC for all cases 
and for all design equations are summarized in Table 4.9 and plotted in Fig. 4.4. 
Note that for the failure cases, the actual FS, denoted by FSA, should be unity. 
However, for the non-failure cases, it is only certain that their FSA is greater than 
unity. As a consequence, the non-failure cases do not offer as much information as the 
failure cases do. For instance, there is one case whose 
CFS
  for modified Terzaghi‟s 
equation is greater than 4.5. This does not imply that modified Terzaghi‟s equation is 
terribly inaccurate for this case. In contrast, there is one case whose 
CFS
  for the slip 
circle method is nearly 0.5, but this indeed implies that the slip circle equation is quite 
conservative for this case. Although the non-failure cases do not offer as much 
information as the failure cases do, they still offer certain amount of information, 
especially for non-failure cases with small 
CFS
 . On the other hand, the cases with 
smaller 
CFS
  offer more information than those with large c.o.v.s. 
By comparing 
CFS
  for the failure cases (open circles in the figure) with the 
limit state FS = 1, it is obvious that modified Terzaghi‟s equation is nearly unbiased, 
while the other two design equations are more or less biased to the conservative side. 
Modified Terzaghi‟s and the slip circle equations perform well with respect to the 
non-failure cases (solid circles), judging from the fact that none of the non-failure 
65 
numerical cases can be either all less than one (slip circle), all greater than one 
(modified Terzaghi) or the mixture of the above two (Bjerrum and Eide), depending 
on which design equation is used. In other words, the FS predicted by the numerical 
MIT-E3 model is on average more conservative than modified Terzaghi‟s equation, on 
average less conservative than the slip circle equation and on average similar to 
Bjerrum and Eide‟s equation. The above conclusion for the comparisons over 
modified Terzaghi‟s and Bjerrum and Eide‟s equation is largely consistent with the 
findings by Hashash and Whittle (1996). 
 
4.7 Calibration of model factor 
As discussed in the preceding section, the actual FS (FSA) for the failure cases 
(they should be exactly unity) may be different from 
CFS
  for the three design 
equations. It is quite possible that FSC from the design equations should be corrected 
by a model factor: 
A CFS FS 
 
(4.8)  
where FSA is the actual FS;   is the model factor; FSC is the FS calculated from the 
design equations. Moreover,   should not be a fixed number among all cases 
because the deviations between FSA and FSC vary throughout all cases. In this study, 
  is modeled as a lognormal random variable with mean value   and c.o.v.  . 
Note that these mean value and c.o.v. should depend on the adopted design equation. 
Since FSC is lognormal, FSA is also lognormal. Moreover, the mean value and c.o.v. 
of AFS  are

For the nine non-failure cases, FSA are greater than one, and it is still possible to 
write down the likelihood function:

(4.11)  
where  P   is the probability, and     denotes the cumulative density function 
for the standard Gaussian distribution. Since the fifteen cases are statistically

each individual likelihood function:

(4.12)  
Based on the principle of maximum likelihood, the (  ,  ) pair that maximizes the 
total likelihood is an optimal estimate for the pair. The contour diagrams for the total 
likelihood are plotted in Fig. 4.5 for the three design equations. All of the total 
likelihoods seem to be uni-modal, indicating that the optimal estimates for (  ,  ) 
are unique. The resulting optimal estimates for (  ,  ) are listed in Table 4.10 for all 
three design equations. 
 From the calibration results, modified Terzaghi‟s equation is the least biased with 
a reasonably small model c.o.v., while Bjerrum and Eide‟s equation is somewhat more 
conservative with the smallest model c.o.v. The slip circle equation is the most 
conservative with the largest model c.o.v. It is interesting to see that modified 
69 
estimate of 
CFS
  is available, the design engineer can easily find the required 
CFS
  
by inverting Eq. (4.13):

Figures 4.6-4.8 show the relation between required 
CFS
  and βT for various levels of 
CFS
  for modified Terzaghi‟s, Bjerrum and Eide‟s and the slip circle design equations, 
respectively. Note that the required design FS 
CFS
  is the FS based on su(mob), so 
the design engineer needs to make sure all su measurement to be converted into 
su(mob) when calculating the FS (e.g., following Table 4.2). 
 Note that the aforementioned design requires an estimate for 
CFS
 . From Figs. 
4.6-4.8, it is clear that the resulting design FS (i.e., 
CFS
 ) is very sensitive to the 
CFS
  
estimate, hence the estimation for 
CFS
  must be done cautiously. One will first need 
to estimate the c.o.v.s for all input parameters for the chosen design equation. Taking 
modified Terzaghi‟s equation as an example, they are  bdeus ,  abus ,  ab   
and  sq . For  bdeus  and  abus , Eq. (4.6) should be used to find these c.o.v.s, 
given the , ,i m t    for each parameter. When i , m  and t  are not able to be 
obtained from site investigation, they can be roughly estimated based on the statistics 
compiled by Phoon (1995). When site investigation is already done, the steps 
described in the section “coefficient of variation of FSC for all case histories” can be 
taken to estimate i , m  and t . Estimates for mR  and iR  can be found from 
Figs. 4.2 and 4.3 according to the number of real tested data points and the dimension 
71 
required FS = 1.2 for Bjerrum & Eide‟s equation is usually the largest, βT 
corresponding to the required FS = 1.5 for Terzaghi‟s equation is slightly less, but βT 
corresponding to the required FS = 1.2 for slip circle method is typically far less 
(except when 
CFS
  is 0.3 and above). This implies that the safety level for slip circle 
method with required FS = 1.2 is much less than the other two methods. 
 
4.9 Summary and conclusions 
In this study, the three popular design equations of base heave are calibrated 
based on real case histories of wide excavations. The actual FS is expressed as the FS 
calculated from design equations corrected by a model factor   due to model 
uncertainty, and the probabilistic characterization of model factor for three design 
equations are calibrated from real case histories. From the calibration results, the 
mean values of model factor (  ) are 1.01, 1.31 and 1.39 and its corresponding c.o.v. 
(  ) are 0.072, 0.064 and 0.21 for modified Terzaghi‟s, Bjerrum and Eide‟s, and slip 
circle design equations, respectively. Modified Terzaghi‟s equation is the least biased 
with a reasonably small model c.o.v., while Bjerrum and Eide‟s equation is somewhat 
more conservative with the smallest model c.o.v. The slip circle equation is the most 
conservative with the largest model c.o.v. It is interesting to see that modified 
Terzaghi‟s and Bjerrum and Eide‟s equations, which are derived from bearing 
capacity theories, seems to have less model uncertainties than the slip circle, which is 
fundamentally a more simple model. 
Before the bias correction, the recommended FS in current codes for the three 
design equations are rather non-uniform: 1.5 for modified Terzaghi‟s equation and 1.2 
for Bjerrum-Eide‟s and slip circle equations. Nonetheless, after the bias correction, the 
resulting recommended FS are quite uniform: 1.52, 1.57 and 1.67 for modified

CHAPTER 5  
RELIABILITY-BASED DESIGN FOR WALL DISPLACEMENT 
INDUCED BY EXCAVATIONS WITH CROSS WALLS 
 
5.1 Introduction 
Excavations adjacent to buildings may lead to serious damage due to large 
deformation, i.e., unsatisfactory performance in the serviceability limit state (SLS). 
Large deformation seems to be unavoidable for deep excavations in soft clay. 
Therefore, in order to reduce the wall displacement caused by excavations, many 
methods are proposed to restrain the deformation, such as ground improvement, soil 
nail, froze soil technique, and other auxiliary facilities, etc. Recently, a new method is 
proposed and further to be validated as an effective way for the reduction of wall 
displacements and adjacent ground settlements. This method is so called “cross wall”. 
The cross walls, connecting two opposite diaphragm walls, can be treated as struts 
during excavation. Unlike conventional construction methods such as bottom-up and 
top-down method, prior to excavations, the cross walls are constructed and provide 
sufficient axial stiffness to reduce the deformation during excavation. The cross walls 
can be constructed by using soil improvement technique or the same method as 
diaphragm wall. In general, the latter can provide larger stiffness and better quality 
than the former. Another feature of cross walls is that it exhibits the similar behavior 
as the corner effect by diaphragm walls (Lin 2010; Ou et al. 2011), and this 
phenomenon can facilitate the restraint of wall displacements. Lin (2010) and Ou et al. 
(2011) from case studies and numerical simulations to validate cross walls can 
effectively reduce wall displacements. Lin (2010) further developed a procedure for 
assessing maximum wall displacements induced by deep excavations in clay with 
75 
reliability-based design (RBD) in terms of partial factors for assessment of maximum 
wall displacements based on the developed regression model is established. Under 
this framework, the RBD can be easily achieved by a deterministic way, and practical 
engineers who are not familiar to reliability theories still can carry out 
reliability-based design. 
 
5.2 Mechanism of cross walls 
Unlike conventional construction methods such as bottom-up and top-down 
methods, lateral supports are installed after the excavation proceeds, the cross walls 
are constructed prior to excavation. According to the study by Ou et al. (2011), the 
cross walls not only provide sufficient axial stiffness to reduce the wall displacement 
induced by excavations, but also exhibit the similar behavior as the corner effect as 
diaphragm wall, i.e., the closer to the cross walls, the smaller wall displacement will 
be taken place. Thus, the cross walls are employed to divide a construction site into 
several small regions, and by the three dimensional corner effects that will facilitate 
the reduction on wall displacements induced by excavation. The cross walls can be 
constructed by overlapping the treated soils through jet grouting or deep soil mixing 
technique. Moreover, the cross walls can also be constructed by the similar method as 
diaphragm walls with better quality and larger stiffness than those of treated soils.  
 
5.3 Case histories  
In order to develop a calculation model for predicting the maximum wall 
displacement applied for deep excavations with and without cross walls, a total 
amount of 22 strutted excavations located in geological division in K1, T2 and one 
case in K2 in Taipei basin where the soft clay dominant the behavior of wall 
displacements are collected. The collected case histories include 11 cases without 
77 
information for each construction stage of cases with and without cross walls are 
summarized in Table 5.4 and Table 5.5, in addition, the wall displacements for each 
inclinometer for both cases are depicted in Fig. 5.4 and Fig. 5.5, respectively. 
As can be seen in Fig. 5.2, the buttress walls are also set between two cross walls 
to facilitate the reduction of wall displacements in some cases of cross walls, because 
the effect of buttress walls is minor compared to cross walls for the restraint of wall 
displacements (Hsieh et al. 2008; Ou et al. 2011), therefore measured wall 
displacements of these cases also included in the database of this study. The purpose 
of the excavation cases without cross walls collected in this study is not only for the 
development of a calculation model which is also applicable for cases without cross 
walls, but also to reveal the effect of cross walls by comparing with cases without 
cross walls. The maximum wall displacement recorded by inclinometer measurements 
are not all at the middle of two cross walls or diaphragm walls, which measured from 
a distance d  away from the cross walls or diaphragm walls, denoted as ,hm d  is 
displayed in Fig. 5.1. The factor of d  may affect the magnitude of maximum wall 
displacements, because cross walls exhibit similar mechanism as the corner effect as 
diaphragm walls, moreover, for cases without cross walls cases, which are also not 
fully in the plan strain condition, and wall displacements are more or less affected by 
the three dimensional effect. The influence of d on ,hm d  will be discussed later. 
 
5.4 Physical model of the equivalent retaining wall system stiffness with cross 
walls 
In order to develop a calculation model that is appropriate for the estimation of 
maximum wall displacements between two cross walls, a physical model is 
established based on the mechanism of retaining wall system. The mechanism of the 
79 
where cwE  is the Young‟s modulus of the cross walls; cwt  is the thickness of cross 
walls. 
Since the total wall displacement at the middle of two cross walls is the 
summation of 1  and 2  as depicted in Fig. 5.6, the stiffness at the middle of two 
cross walls can be evaluated by treating the performance of 1k  and 2k  as a series 
spring system, and then the equivalent stiffness at the middle of two cross walls 
denoted as cK  can be evaluated by: 
 1 2 1 2cK k k k k   (5.3) 
Comparing 1k  and 2k , the value of 1k  will be smaller than 2k  in general, 
because the order in denominator of 1k  is higher than that of 2k . In real condition, 
the axial compression in length of cross walls ( 2 ) will be expected to be a small 
amount compared to the middle deflection ( 1 ) of cross walls. Therefore, the 
modeling of the equivalent stiffness at the middle of two cross walls ( cK ) by treating 
1k  and 2k  as a series spring system that weak portion ( 1k ) dominate the total 
displacement ( 1 2  ) at the middle of two cross walls is appropriate. Moreover, 1k  
is significantly influenced by 'L . Therefore, it may imply that the spacing the cross 
walls ( 'L ) is an important factor for the control of wall displacements at the middle of 
two cross walls. 
Conceptually, cK  in Eq. (5.3) is still applicable for the cases without cross walls. 
For cases without cross walls, the diaphragm walls can be treated as the cross walls 
with spacing 'L  equaling to the length of the excavation. Thus, cK  in Eq. (5.3) 
would still be applicable for cases without cross walls. 
Besides cross walls, the whole retaining wall system also include steel struts and 
concrete floor slabs, which are commonly served as lateral supports in bottom-up and 
top-down construction methods, and they also provide axial stiffness for restraining 
81 
this assumption denoted as AK  is expressed as: 
 3 1 2 1 2 3A cK K k k k k k k      (5.6) 
Model B: 
From the real case histories, it revealed that 3k >> 1k  and 2k >> 1k , it indicate 
the 3k  will dominate the whole behavior if model A ( AK ) is applied. In general, 
lateral supports are usually installed in different level as excavation proceeds, and the 
locations of lateral supports are usually not at the same level as that of the occurrence 
of maximum wall displacements. Therefore, the stiffness of lateral supports may not 
be fully propagated for the restraint of the maximum wall displacements. Moreover, 
from the comparison between observed performance of bottom-up and top-down 
construction methods, the effect of stiffness of lateral supports 3k  on the restraint of 
wall displacements is minor, and this phenomenon will be discussed later. Therefore, 
from the above discussion, a better model is to reduce the influence of 3k  and 
highlight the influence of 1k  on maximum wall displacements. By keeping the 
performance mentioned above, another model is proposed based on the assumption 
that 2k  and 3k  are modeled as a parallel system, and then this parallel system and 
1k  are modeled as a series system, thus the retaining wall system stiffness of this 
model denoted as BK  is expressed as: 
   1 2 3 1 2 3BK k k k k k k      (5.7) 
In the above, the two possible models ( AK  and BK ) for characterizing the retaining 
wall system stiffness at the middle of two cross walls are proposed. It should be noted 
that AK  and BK  herein is the equivalent retaining wall system stiffness about the 
maximum wall displacement at the middle of two cross walls or diaphragm walls. 
In the following, the appropriateness of these two models are verified and 
discussed by the following conditions: 
83 
and BK  are compared with the field performance for further validation of the 
proposed models. 
Since d  or say corner effect may affect the magnitude of maximum wall 
displacement, and the monitoring locations of the wall displacements for all cases are 
not all at the middle of two cross walls or diaphragm walls. For the purpose of a more 
fair comparison on the observed performance, it is better to eliminate the effect of d  
on ,hm d . As discussed previously that except for the axial displacements of cross 
walls 2  (as shown in Fig. 5.6), the wall deflection behavior between two cross walls 
or diaphragm walls would be similar as that of a fixed-end beam subjected to a 
uniform pressure. Therefore, according to this structural model, the maximum wall 
displacement at any location d away from the cross walls and diaphragm walls ( ,hm d ) 
can be converted into the maximum wall displacements at the middle of two cross 
walls or diaphragm walls denoted as ,hm m . 
For ease of discussion, , ,hm d hm m   can be expressed as: 
, 1 2
, 1 2
hm d
hm m
DR
DR
  
  
 
 

 (5.8) 
where 1  is the maximum wall deflection at the middle of two cross walls or 
diaphragm walls; 2  is the axial displacements of cross walls or diaphragm walls as 
depicted in Fig. 5.6; DR  is the displacement reduction factor for considering the 
corner effect of cross walls or diaphragm walls, i.e., the closer to the cross walls or 
diaphragm walls, the smaller wall displacements will be taken place. Since 2  would 
be much smaller than 1 , therefore , ,hm d hm m   is close to DR  as expressed in Eq. 
(5.8). As mentioned previously, except for the axial displacements of cross walls 2  
(as shown in Fig. 5.6), the wall deflection behavior between two cross walls can be 
reasonably simulated by a fixed-end beam subjected to a uniform pressure which can 
85 
is treated as the equivalent retaining wall system stiffness about maximum wall 
displacement at the middle of two cross walls or diaphragm walls, and is denoted as 
eqK . The factor of eqK  is also employed as a lumped parameter on the development 
of a regression model for estimating maximum wall displacements at the middle of 
two cross walls or diaphragm walls. 
 
5.5 Observed performance of excavation from collected case histories 
Before developing a regression model for estimating maximum wall 
displacement, it is interesting to investigate the behavior of wall displacements in 
deep excavations with and without cross walls from field performance. In the 
following, observed performance of the collected case histories including cases with 
and without cross walls will be discussed. 
 
Effect of excavation depth 
The relation between ,hm d  and excavation depth ( eH ) for cases without and with 
cross walls are plotted in Fig. 5.12(a) and Fig. 5.12(b), respectively. The value of 
,hm d  for cases without cross walls are bounded by ,hm d =0.3% eH  and ,hm d =0.8% 
eH , and the average value is ,hm d =0.5% eH . The bound is larger than that of the 
study by Ou et al. (1993) for excavations in Taipei, and it may be due to the ground 
condition consisted of larger thickness of soft clay in the collected case histories in 
this study. For cases with cross walls, ,hm d  are bounded by ,hm d = 0.1% eH  and 
,hm d = 0.35% eH , and the average is ,hm d = 0.2% eH . By comparing those results, 
the bounds of ,hm d  for cross walls cases are smaller than those of cases without cross 
87 
The normalized undrained shear strength 'u vs   versus ,hm m eH  is plotted in Fig. 
5.16. Due to the case histories are mainly collected in the geological division zone of 
K1 and T2 in Taipei basin, the influence of 'u vs   on ,hm m eH  is hard to observe 
from Fig. 5.16. 
 
Effect of eqK  
The equivalent retaining wall system stiffness ( eqK )= BK  versus ,hm m eH  is plotted 
in Fig. 5.17. As can be seen in Fig. 5.17, as eqK  increase, the ,hm m eH  has a 
decreasing trend. This exhibition is reasonable and may indicate the derivation on 
eqK  is appropriate for the modeling of retaining wall system stiffness on the behavior 
of ,hm m . 
The first glance on the effect of a single factor versus ,hm m  or ,hm m eH  that 
facilitate the preliminary sensitivity analyses are discussed above, however, the ,hm m  
is really the reflection of many factors. The magnitude of ,hm m  cannot be 
appropriately evaluated by a single factor. By the reason, in order to obtain a more 
reliable and accurate estimation on ,hm m , the development of a regression model 
would be better for the estimation of the magnitude of maximum wall displacements 
,hm m . The following section is contributed on the development of a regression model 
for the estimation of ,hm d  and ,hm m  based on collected case histories. 
 
5.6 Regression analysis based on the collected case histories 
89 
be the average 'cwf  over the height of cross walls ( cwh ) in this study. Except for 
'
u vs  , the other parameters can be directly obtained from collected case histories. 
Since the site investigation of collected case histories are not all available, nonetheless 
from previous investigation by Wang (2000), he collected the undrained shear 
strength data from different test type for different geological zones in Taipei basin. 
Because the data point of undrained shear strength from isotropic consolidated 
undrained compression (CIUC) test is much and is more representative than other test 
type. Thus, the normalized undrained shear strength from CIUC test denoted as 
'
u vs   (CIUC) is used to characterize the soil strength for the collected cases. One 
should be noted herein that sA  is the total cross sectional area within the area of 
'L ×
eH , where eH  is the staged excavation depth in the estimation of eqK . 
As can be seen in Fig. 5.2, the monitoring locations of the wall displacement for 
all cases are not all at the middle of two cross walls or diaphragm walls. Since the 
eqK  is derived based on the stiffness at the middle of two cross walls where the 
maximum wall displacement take place, therefore, it is not appropriate to use eqK  as 
one of the parameters for the development of a regression model for estimating the 
maximum wall displacements which are not at the middle of two cross walls. A 
possible procedure is used to address this issue. This approach is to estimate the 
maximum wall displacement at the middle of two cross walls ( ,hm m ), and then the 
maximum wall displacement at the distance d  away from the cross walls or 
diaphragm walls ( ,hm d ) can be obtained by multiplying ,hm m  by a displacement 
reduction factor ( DR ) as defined in Eq. (5.8), and DR  can be estimated through Eq. 
(5.9). As highlighted by Ou et al. (2010), the cross walls exhibit the corner effect as 
91 
Fig. 5.19. The pairs of predicted ,hm d  by real and default value of 
'
cwf  are almost 
fall into the 45
0
 inclined line. It revealed that 'cwf  is insensitive to the predicted 
,hm d  by Eq. (5.10). Therefore, the default value of 
'
cwf  are adopted in the 
subsequent analyses. 
 
5.6.1 Performance of the regression model 
As the regression model is developed based on the collected case histories, the 
performance of the regression model would reflect the characterization of the 
observed performance as mentioned in the previous section. As can be seen in Fig. 5.9, 
the stiffness of lateral supports ( 3k ) seem not have significant influence on ,hm m eH , 
and it provided the information that the performance of ,hm m eH  is not significantly 
influenced by construction methods such as bottom-up and top-down methods with 
different stiffness of lateral supports ( 3k ). Moreover, from parametric analysis on the 
developed regression model, it also revealed that the performance of maximum wall 
displacements is quite similar for cases using bottom-up and top-down construction 
methods. Therefore, in the following discussion on the performance of the regression 
model, both construction methods of bottom-up and top-down will be discussed 
together. 
The relation between eH  versus ,hm m  from 1000 randomly selected design 
parameters within the ranges listed in Table 5.7 for bottom-up and top-down 
construction methods by regression model (Eq. (5.10)) are plotted in Fig. 5.20. The 
simulated results by regression model show larger eH  results in larger ,hm m , which 
is similar to the observed performance in field. By the implementation of the same 
93 
be a non-negative number, therefore, the model factor M  is assumed to follow by a 
lognormal distribution ( M e , where   is normally distributed). For convenience 
of characterizing the model uncertainty, the relation between  ,log hm dm  and 
predicted  ,log hm d  is expressed in the form: 
   , ,log loghm dm hm d     (5.12) 
where  followed a normal distribution with zero mean and standard deviation = m . 
The m  is used to quantify the model uncertainty between  ,log hm dm  and 
 ,log hm d and can be estimated by: 
    

hm d represent the i-th predicted  ,log hm d  by Eq. (5.10); N  is the total 
number of data. The estimation of m  is 0.42 by Eq. (5.13). The aforementioned 
m  is not fully caused by the model uncertainty, because the model input parameters 
may include inherent variability and measurement errors. For reliability-based design 
purpose, it is desirable to separate the uncertainty from different source. A possible 
method may probably achieve the goal. The calibration of model uncertainty will be 
discussed later. 
 
5.7 Reliability based design 
As discussed previously, the developed regression model (Eq. (5.10)) for 
estimating ,hm d  existed model uncertainty. Moreover, the model input parameters 
also included uncertainties. Neglecting those uncertainties may lead to the low safety 
95 
defined as      , , ,tolSR Z U Z U Z   , where  ,U Z   and  ,tolU Z   are the 
deformation and tolerable deformation, respectively. 
A safety ratio less than 1 does not necessarily imply the complete collapse of the 
system but does imply unsatisfactory performance of the system in the sense of 
violating some limit states, e.g., serviceability, repairable, or ultimate limit states. 
Throughout the theory, it can be assumed without loss of generality that  ,SR Z   is 
positive and that the probability density function (PDF) of the random vector Z  
conditioned on  , denoted by  |p z  , is known. 
The partial factor approach is to enforce the following algebraic constraint 
during the design process: 
   1 1 2 2, , ,..., , 1T c c c cm mSR z SR z z z         (5.15) 
where the superscript “T” denotes vector transpose; i  is the partial factor for the 
i-th random variable iZ ; 
c
iz  is the characteristic value or mean value of iZ . The 
design vector   is adjusted iteratively until Eq. (5.15) is achieved. Not all 
components need to be adjusted simultaneously. 
It is possible to find the partial factors  1 ,..., m   so that the partial factor constraint 
in Eq. (5.15) and the reliability constraint in Eq. (5.14) are equivalent. One well 
known approach is to calculate the partial factors at the design point produced by the 
First-Order Reliability Method (FORM). This approach is commonly adopted in 
calibrating RBD codes such as Annex C of BS EN 1990:2002 “Eurocode: Basis of 
Structural Design” (British Standards Institute, 2002). However, there are other 
combinations of partial factors that can fulfill this goal. In other words, partial factors 
are not unique, despite the impression given by tables in design codes. A sensible

 (5.19) 
In Eq. (5.19), note that the numerator is a deterministic number and the denominator 
is a random variable depending on . Equation (5.19) is the key equation in the 
proposed quantile-based partial factor approach. 
The following steps can be taken to find the partial factors  1 ,..., m   
corresponding to any prescribed target failure probability, *fP : 
1. Find the relation between the pair *, fP    by solving Eq. (5.19).  
2. For a prescribed target failure probability, *fP , find the corresponding probability 
threshold  from the result in Step 1. 
3. The partial factor for the i-th random variable is simply ci i iz z
  , where iz
  is 
the  quantile (or the 1- quantile depending on the nature of the variable) of iZ  
and ciz  is its characteristic value or mean value. This step is not necessary if 
engineers are comfortable with the application of quantiles in Eq. (5.17). 
Before implementation of RBD, the random variables and design parameters need 
to be defined. Therefore, the following section is to determine the uncertain variables 
and design parameters in the developed regression model. 
 
5.7.2 Random variables and design parameters 
The basic model input parameters for estimating ,hm d  by regression model 
(Eq.(5.10)) are compressive strength of concrete for diaphragm walls ( 'cdf ), cross 
walls ( 'cwf ), and concrete floor slabs (
'
csf ) (for top-down construction method), the 
99 
variables Z  for the predicted maximum wall displacement ( ,hm d ) by Eq. (5.10) are 
eqK , 
'
u vs 
 
and M . 
For random variables, the typical design values of compressive strength of 
concrete = 27.5 MPa is adopted as the mean value for concrete materials such as 
diaphragm walls, cross walls and concrete floor slabs. In fact, the cross walls may be 
made by low compressive strength of concrete because the cross walls will be 
dismantled as excavation proceeds. However, 'cwf  is insensitive to the predicted 
maximum wall displacement by Eq. (5.10), thus the design value of 'cwf  of 27.5 MPa 
is still used as the mean value of 'cwf  for simplification. For stE , the typical design 
value of 210 GPa is adopted as its mean value in this study. The c.o.v.s of 'cdf , 
'
cwf  
and 'csf  are typically in the range of 0.1-0.2. For stE , the c.o.v. is roughly in the 
range of 0.1-0.3. For transformation uncertainty in Eq. (5.20), the c.o.v. of E is 
commonly in the range of 0.1-0.3. For 'u vs  (CIUC), the mean value and c.o.v. are 
typically in the range of 0.2-0.4 and 0.2-0.4, respectively. 
The design parameters  and its applicable ranges for estimating maximum wall 
displacements are summarized in Table 5.7. The range for each design parameter  in 
Table 5.7 is summarized based on the collected case histories in order to avoid the 
extrapolation of Eq. (5.10). As summarized in Table 5.6, the mean values and c.o.v. of 
some random variables are not a fixed number but rather distributed in a certain range, 
therefore the of c.o.v.s of 'cdf , 
'
cwf , 
'
csf , E , stE , 
'
u vs  (CIUC) and mean value of 
'
u vs  (CIUC) are also treated as design parameters  in this study. In real condition, 
the sA  is related to excavation depth ( eH ), because deeper eH  will need more

(5.22) is that the relation between  and *fP  is not related to the tolerable maximum 
wall displacement ( ,hm tol ), because the ,hm tol  will be cancelled out through the

derivation of the relation between  and *fP , and  eqK
   can still be easily 
estimated by   ,
eqK eq
K E Z   for different   for the case of the top-down 
construction method. 
 
Evaluation of relation between   and *fP  
For the ease of discussion,    , ,SR z SR Z    in Eq. (5.22) denoted by 
 ,G Z  . It is then clear that 
*
fP  is simply the exceedance probability of  ,G Z   
over the unity. Therefore, the relation between   and *fP  can be determined by any 
reliability method, in particular the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS): draw N  
samples of  ,Z  , denoted by  ( ) ( ), : 1,...,i iZ i N    , where Z  samples are 
drawn from the PDF of Z  with mean value and c.o.v. of random variables Z  listed 
105 
variability of model uncertainty by Eq. (5.13). For reliability-based design point of 
view, it is desirable to obtain the variability that is purely caused by the model 
uncertainty. An approach proposed in this study may be possible to address this issue. 
The functional relation between   and *fP  can be obtained from the 
implementation of Eq. (5.22) by using the real design parameters   of collected case 
histories with the typical c.o.v.s of the uncertain variables are listed in the parentheses 
in Table 5.7. For a specified *fP  or reliability index , the   can be obtained from 
functional relation between   and *fP , and then M
 , 'u vs

 and  eqK
   can 
be evaluated by Eq. (5.23), Eq.(5.24) and Eqs. (5.25)-(5.26), respectively. The 
maximum wall displacement calculated by replacing M , 'u vs  and  eqK   by 
M , 'u vs

 and  eqK
   as well as real design parameters in Eq. (5.10) denoted as 
,hm d
  can be obtained. Since the measured maximum wall displacement ( ,hm dm ) for 
collected case histories are known, it is possible to compare the ,hm dm  and ,hm d
  
under a specified *fP . Defining , ,hm d hm dm
   as the failure event F, by changing 
*
fP , we can calculate the probability of , ,hm d hm dm
   denoted as  P F  for all 
case cases and for each construction stage. It is desirable that  P F  roughly equal to 
the specified *fP  if the estimation of model uncertainty and variability of model 
input parameters are appropriate. The mean value and 95% confidence interval of 
reliability index of actual reliability index is plotted against the specified reliability 
index () that is the model  in Fig. 5.25. It is not surprising that  P F  is greater 
than the specified 
*
fP , i.e., the actual  smaller than model , because the m

However one need to be noted that '

Verification and calibration of partial factors 
One may worry that the relation between   and *fP  will change with different 
combination of design parameters  , which will cause the requirement for the 
re-estimation of the relation between   and *fP  if   changes. It will lead to an 
inconvenience for RBD by designers. 
It is desirable that the relation between   and *fP  will not change 
significantly with different design parameters , then   and *fP  calibrated from 
any  can then be used for another . For verification of this point, one way is to 
calibrate [ , *fP ] for 200 sets of randomly selected design parameters   within the 
ranges as listed in Table 5.7 for bottom-up construction method, which is the 
109 
reliability index  [1.5, 2.0, 2.5. 3.0, 3.5], the   is chosen from the average [ , *fP ] 
for different ranges of 'L  for different construction method, and to back-calculate the 
400 spacing of cross walls 'L  to satisfy the RBD constraint by Eq. (5.29) for a 
prescribed ,hm tol , which is randomly selected from 30-100 mm herein. One should 
note that because [ , *fP ] is calibrated in different ranges of 
'L . If the back 
calculated results of 'L  is not within the calibrated domain. Then, the sample is 
re-drawn until the back-calculated 'L  is within the calibrated domain of the adopted 
[ , *fP ]. 
Once 'L  are obtained, moreover other design parameters are all known, then, 
the Monte Carlo simulation is employed to estimate the probability of ,hm d > ,hm tol  
for these 400 randomly selected sets of  , and the mean value, low bound, upper 
bound, and the c.o.v. of the reliability index corresponding to the five different 
specified  [1.5, 2.0, 2.5. 3.0, 3.5] for bottom-up and top-down methods with different 
ranges of 'L  are shown in Table 5.8 and Table 5.9, respectively. As can be seen in 
Table 5.8 and Table 5.9, the mean values of estimated  by MCS is very close to the 
corresponding specified , and low and upper bounds are also within the tolerable 
ranges. It can be found in Table 5.8 and Table 5.9 that the c.o.v. will slightly increase 
as the range of 'L  becomes smaller. This phenomenon is due to the variation of 
[ , *fP ] is larger for smaller range of 
'L , nonetheless, the c.o.v. of s are in a 
acceptable range. This results verifies that the average [ , *fP ] (dashed line in Figs. 
5.26-5.30) is appropriate for RBD for bottom-up and top-down construction methods. 
Therefore, in the following, the average [ , *fP ] is used to establish the relation 
between 
*
fP  and partial factors which are '

5.7.4 Design example 
As the RBD charts in terms of partial factors versus target failure probability 
have been established, a design example is illustrated how to apply those charts for 
RBD in this section. 
Assume a site in Taipei is planned to carry out deep excavation for the 
construction of building basement for car parking. From site investigation, the 
normalized undrained shear strength ( 'u vs  ) of the site is 0.33 from CIUC test. The 
length of the diaphragm wall is 28 m with thickness of 1 m is chosen as the retaining 
wall, and the bottom-up construction method is employed in this case. The excavation 
width (B) and the length of the excavation site ( 'L ) are 45 m and 120 m, respectively. 
The final excavation depth ( efH ) is 16 m and four layers of H-type steel struts with 
Young‟s modulus of 210 GPa that are H350X350X12X19, H400X400X13X21, 
2H400X400X13X21 and 2H350X350X12X19 used to be the temporary lateral 
supports with the horizontal spacing ( sh ) of 5 m, therefore the total cross sectional 
area at final stage of excavation within the area of 'L × efH  ( sA ) is 
(173.87+218.69+218.69×2+173.87×2)×120/5. The design compressive strength of 
diaphragm is 27.5 MPa. According to the investigation of the buildings conditions 
adjacent to the excavation site, the tolerable maximum wall displacement ( ,hm tol ) is 
set to be 80 mm. By using the developed regression model (Eq. (5.10)), the estimated 
,hm m  is 91.6 mm which is greater than the tolerable value. Therefore, the cross walls 
is planned to be used for the constraint of maximum wall displacement. As can be 
seen in Fig. 5.18, it reveals that the scatter of the calculation model, moreover, the 
113 
necessary step is to check the calculated 'L  is within the calibrated domain of 
adopted [ , *fP ]. Since the calculated 
'L  is within the range of 15-136 m, it implies 
the calculated 'L  is correct. If the calculated 'L  is not within the range, the same 
procedure need to be carried out again until calculated 'L  within the ranges of the 
calibrated [ , *fP ]. The flow chart for RBD of maximum wall displacements in 
excavations is summarized and depicted in Fig. 5.35. 
The RBD result indicates that the target probability of ,hm m > ,hm tol  (=80 mm) 
is 0.01 when 'L  = 21.3 m. Therefore, the cross walls with total height = 12 m and 
spacing = 21.3 m is used in this case. 
Based on this case, a further investigation on the role of spacing of cross walls 
( 'L ) in the SLS design in deep excavations is studied. For a prescribed ,hm tol  = 80 
mm, the reliability index () versus 'L  is depicted in Fig. 5.36. As 'L  increased, the 
corresponding eqK  reduced as plotted in Fig. 5.37, and the  decreased. It indicated 
in order to achieve higher safety level (larger ), the smaller 'L  is required. This 
phenomenon revealed that smaller 'L  will lead to smaller ,hm m  and result in higher 
. This behavior makes sense to design of cross walls. On another point of view, if a 
*
fP =0.01 is specified, the relation between ,hm tol  and required 
'L  is plotted in Fig. 
5.38, and the corresponding eqK  to the required 
'L
 
is depicted in Fig. 5.39. It can be 
interpreted as when ,hm tol  is smaller, the smaller 
'L  which result in larger eqK  is 
required to obtain smaller ,hm tol  for achieving 
*
fP =0.01, and vice versa. The 
above-mentioned phenomenon highlighted the importance of 'L  in the RBD for SLS 
design on maximum wall displacements in deep excavations.

CHAPTER 6  
CONCLUSIONS AND SUGGESTIONS 
 
6.1 Conclusions 
According to the studies on the reliability based design (RBD) of basal heave 
stability and wall displacements in deep excavations with and without cross walls in 
clay, some conclusions can be drawn in this study and are summarized as follows. 
 
6.1.1 The spatial averaging effect on the reliability-based design of basal heave 
stability 
1. The non-stationary random fields are used to simulate the undrained shear 
strength with normalized behavior ( 'u vs  =constant) and employ slip circle 
method to investigate the spatial averaging effect on the impact of reliability based 
design of basal heave stability. Analysis results reveal that spatial average effect 
plays an important role in RBD of basal heave stability. Neglecting spatial 
averaging effect would lead to overly conservative design. As highlighted by 
Vanmarcke (1977), the spatial variability averaged over a domain is less than its 
spatial variability. From reliability analysis, it indicates the scale of fluctuation 
(SOF) is a key factor dominating the extent of spatial averaging effect, and 
smaller SOF would results in more averaging effect involved and can reduce the 
variability averaged over a domain. 
2. According to the investigation by Phoon (1995), from his study, it revealed that 
the average c.o.v. of undrained shear strength is 0.3, and the average SOF is 2.5m. 
Under this condition, the calibrated required FSs are in the range of 1.4-1.9 and 
1.6-2.4 for target failure probability of 0.01 and 0.001, respectively. Those bounds 
117 
Reliability-based design charts in terms of target reliability index versus required 
factor of safety are developed for RBD of basal heave stability for deep 
excavations in case of excavation depth less than excavation width. 
 
6.1.3 Performance of deep excavations with and without cross walls and 
reliability-based design of serviceability limit state on maximum wall 
displacements 
1. From field observation, it revealed that ratio of maximum wall displacements 
between cross walls over excavation depth ( ,hm d eH ) for cases with cross walls 
is smaller than those without cross walls. It indicated cross walls can effectively 
reduce the wall displacements. For cross walls cases, the ,hm d  bounded by 
,hm d =0.1% eH  and ,hm d =0.35% eH , and the average is ,hm d =0.2% eH .  
2. From field observation, it revealed that the spacing of cross walls ( 'L ) plays an 
important role for the constraint of maximum wall displacements. Smaller 'L  
would result in smaller ratio of maximum wall displacement at the middle of two 
cross walls over excavation depth ( ,hm m eH ).  
3. The equivalent retaining walls system stiffness ( eqK ) composed of diaphragm 
walls, cross walls and lateral supports based on its mechanism is proposed which 
is also applicable for cases without cross walls, and is validated to be appropriate 
for characterizing the behavior of wall displacement, i.e., larger eqK  would result 
in smaller ratio of maximum wall displacement at the middle of two cross walls 
over excavation depth ( ,hm m eH ). 
4. Based on the field performance of strutted excavations with and without cross

Although the theorem seems nontrivial, a simple procedure based on Monte 
Carlo simulation (MCS) can be used to estimate the *  vs. *fP  relation: Draw N  
samples of Z, denoted by  ( ) : 1,...,iZ i N , where Z  samples are drawn from the 
PDF of Z . For this study, Z simply contains Mr and Md. Procedures of simulating 
these samples have been discussed in the previous sections. Let 
   ( ) ( ) ,i iG FS SR Z   . At the end of MCS, we have  ( ) : 1,...,iG i N . For a 
chosen *  value, the corresponding *fP  value can be easily estimated by Law of 
Large Number: 
 * ( ) *
1
1

  
N
i
F
i
P I G
N
 (A-4)  
By changing the *  value, one can estimate the corresponding *fP  values by 
repetitively applying Eq. (A-4); then, the entire functional relation between *  and 
*
fP  is obtained. 
One may worry that the so-determined *  vs. *fP  relation will change if the 
value of design parameter   changes. However, it turns out the *  vs. *fP  relation 
usually does not change dramatically for a wide range of possible   values. This is 
because the probability distribution of    ,FS SR Z   usually does not change 
much with   due to the cancellation between  FS   and  ,SR Z   in division: 
when   is varying,  FS   and  ,SR Z   either increase or decrease in a similar 
pattern. The invariance of the probability distribution of    , FS SR Z  implies 
that     *, |P FS SR Z      is in fact not a strong function of  , i.e., the *  
vs. 
*
fP  relation does not strongly vary with 
