variables, 　land fl are respectively the exponential 
damping frequency and the carrier frequency, and would 
be the intrinsic characteristics of the system. L is the 
quantity of resonance mode of the system. 　lm and 　ln 
are the initial angles for the amplitude modulation. It 
should be noted that the frequencies of modulating signal 
dm(t) and gn(t) would be always much smaller than that of 
the carrier signal, and the frequencies of modulating 
signal dm(t) and gn(t) are higher than those of qm(t), alm(t), 
qn(t) and aln(t). Accordingly, the modulated signal would 
be expanded around the frequencies of the carrier signal. 
This phenomenon is named as amplitude modulation. 
Suppose that the impulse responses due to impacts 
dm(t) are completely died out in a time interval between 
two consecutive contacts, and the resonance frequency fl 
is high. The impact energy due to the surface irregularity 
gn(t)qn(t) would be much smaller than that due to the 
bearing defects. Thus, the second summation term of Eq. 
(1) could be eliminated. Accordingly, the vibration signal 
could be rewritten as

where mod(t, 1/fdm) represents a residue of t, and fdm is the

frequency resonance technique to detect the envelope 
signal, the vibration signal of defect bearing is operated 
through a bandpass filter to derive a single resonance 
mode and then taking the enveloping transformation to 
retrieve an envelope signal. The spectrum for the 
envelope signal would show a pattern of the modulating 
signal at the resonance frequency and its harmonics with 
equal frequency spacing sidebands which are induced by 
the frequencies of qm(t) and alm(t). However, there is no 
guarantee the bandpass filter could derived a complete 
mode vibration. Thus, it could seriously distort the 
envelope signal. 
According to Eq. (2), the vibration signal 
decomposed into the sinusoidal function bases at 
fundamental frequencies fl, with l=1…L, for a defect 
bearing could be represented as

In general, the mechanical structure should be strong 
enough to stably support the bearing system. Thus, the 
first mode resonance frequency could be high and away 
from the range of low-frequency mechanical noise. In 
addition, it is noted that the envelope signal 
corresponding to the vibration would become smoother, 
and the envelope signal could thus be approximated as a 
stepwise function. The coefficients α l(t) and β l(t)at the 
time interval of jth step would be constants α l(j) and βl(j). 
For the vibration analysis of finite resonance modes, 
the time intervals for the different resonance modes 
should be the same in order to simplify the estimation for 
the coefficients, α l(j) and β l(j), of jth step. In addition, 
such a time interval should be small enough to fit the 
envelope estimation for a resonance mode in the higher 
frequency band. Accordingly, this mode vibration vl(t) 
mapping to the sinusoidal function basis with 
fundamental frequency fl could be expressed in a discrete

respectively. It is noted that the absence of low-frequency 
mechanical noise in the range of the system resonance for 
the vibration vl(t) in Eq. (4) could be achieved by the 
signal processing method. Accordingly, the envelope 
signal could be approximated as

2.2 The envelope estimation for the modulated signal 
As shown in Fig. 1, there are more than 2L sampling 
points in an estimation interval for the modulated 
vibration with only one resonance mode. So that, there 
would be more than 2L equations to solve the unknown 
coefficients α l(j) and β l(j). Accordingly, the sampling 
frequency fs must be at least 4L times higher than the first 
mode resonance frequency f1. In addition, an anti-aliasing 
low-pass filter with the cutoff frequency at / 2sf  Hz 
should be adopted in the signal processing of the 
measured vibration signal. According to the cutoff 
frequency / 2sf , the number of resonance modes could 
be determined from the vibration spectrum. 
If the number of data points is h over the jth interval 
of the vibration signal in Eq. (3), these points could be 
expressed in the matrix form,

Because w(.) in Eq. (6) is a low-frequency mechanical 
noise, its mean value would approach to zero. Thus, it is 
assumed that the vibration signal is unbiased and the 
expectation of the noise would be zero for the summation 
In order to simulate the condition of real data and 
investigate the effectiveness of the signal processing 
method in Section 2, the first three resonance modes are 
filtered through a lowpass filter with the cutoff frequency 
at 7 kHz and the sampling rate is 50 kHz. It is noted that 
the required sampling rates for adequately estimating 
these three mode vibration should be more than 21.6, 45.6, 
and 78 kHz, respectively. Thus, under the condition of 
sampling rate 50 kHz the vibration analysis for the third 
mode vibration would adopt the neighbor points of the 
time interval to join its corresponding enveloping 
estimation. From the following study, it is found that the 
estimation result is very well. Fig. 3 shows the result of 
applying the envelope estimation algorithm. Fig. 3(a) is 
the vibration signal after filtered through the lowpass 
filter with the cutoff frequency at 7 kHz. Figs. 3(b)-(d) 
show the estimated envelope signals corresponding to the 
first three resonance modes, respectively. In comparison 
Fig. 3(e) with 3(a), it is found that the envelope 
estimation algorithm could effectively estimate the 
envelope signal and reconstruct the vibration signal. In 
addition, it is noted that the estimation errors of the 
exponential decay for the first two resonance modes, as 
shown in Table 1, are less than 2 %. The serious 
estimation error of the exponential decay occurred in the 
third resonance mode is owing to the truncation at the 
cutoff frequency 7 kHz. In Fig.4, the envelope spectrum 
clear shows the characteristic frequencies at 100 Hz and 
its harmonics. On the other hand, Fig. 5 shows both the 
time domain and the frequency domain of the above 
simulated signal disturbed by a Gaussian distributed noise 
with the frequency range from 0 to 0.5 kHz. Similar to 
Fig. 3, the result of applying the envelope estimation 
algorithm is shown in Fig. 6 except that there is higher 
level noise present in Fig. 6(b) and (c). It should be noted 
that the comparison between Fig. 3(d) and 6(d) is almost 
the same. In addition, Fig. 7 shows a clear pattern at the 
defect frequency for the envelope spectra and is similar to 
Fig. 4. Thus, the proposed method for envelope detection 
is very good in the frequency domain analysis. 
In Table 1, the estimation results of the exponential 
decay for the simulated signal with/without 
low-frequency noise are listed. It is noted that the 
accuracy of estimation result for the simulation signal 
without low-frequency noise is very well for the first two 
resonance modes. The serious estimation errors of the 
exponential decay for these third resonance modes are 
because a lowpass filter twists its mode vibration and the 
inadequate sampling rate is applied. Accordingly, it shows 
that the proposed method could be effective in estimating 
the exponential decay for the first two resonance modes. 
On the other hand, the estimation errors of the 
exponential decay for the simulated signal with disturbing 
noise are also good enough to apply the exponential decay 
in the diagnosis of bearing defect. It should be noted that 
the condition of applying the disturbing noise is under the 
worst consideration. When the bandwidth and magnitude 
of noise is decreased, the estimation result for the first 
two resonance modes would be very much improved. 
Thus, the proposed signal processing method is capable of 
applying in the estimation of exponential decay for the 
estimated envelope of a multi-resonance-mode vibration. 
 
4. Experimental study 
In the following, the applications of the proposed 
method to the vibration signals of tapered roller bearings 
(SKF type 32208) are studied. The experimental setup is 
shown in Ref. [9]. The electrical-discharge machining 
method is applied to produce artificial defect on the 
surface of bearing components which are roller, outer race 
and inner race, as shown in Fig. 8. The defect sizes are 
shown described in the Table 2. The vibration signals are 
measured on the housing of the test bearing by mounting 
an accelerometer with the sensitivity 10.41 mV/g. The 
measured direction is radial to the shaft in the horizontal. 
The tested bearings run at 800 and 1600 rpm. The 
characteristic frequencies of tested bearings for roller, 
outer-race and inner-race are 77.3 Hz, 94.6 Hz and 131.9 
Hz, respectively. The sampling rate 50 kHz and an 
anti-aliasing low-pass filter with the cutoff frequency at 7 
kHz are applied. 
By applying a recursive estimation algorithm for the 
resonance frequencies of the outer-race defect bearing at 
running speed 800 rpm, three resonance frequencies are 
converged at 1791, 3769, and 6457 Hz, respectively. 
When applying the proposed signal processing method in 
the inner-race defect bearing, the first three resonance 
frequencies are converged at 2351, 3927, and 6666 Hz, 
respectively. An investigation on the roller defect bearing 
finds the first three resonance frequencies at 1842, 3689, 
and 6424 Hz, respectively. Finally, a study on the multiple 
defect bearing finds the first three resonance frequencies 
at 1785, 3940, and 5704 Hz, respectively. Applying Eq. 
(18) in estimating the exponential decay for the first three 
resonance modes, the averages of 20 times for the above 
conditions are listed in Table 3. 
On the other hand, the estimation result for a normal 
bearing is investigated to contrast that for the defect types 
of bearing. The first three resonance frequencies for the 
normal bearing are converged at 1549, 3687, and 6434 Hz, 
respectively, which are similar to those for the outer-race 
and roller defect bearings. By estimating 20 times of the 
exponential decay in Eq. (18) for the first three resonance 
modes, it is found that the exponential decay in Table 3 
are rapidly increased with the mode number of bearing 
vibration and the averages of the exponential decay for 
the normal bearing are much smaller than those for defect 
types of bearing. Thus, a quantity index for the bearing 
defect diagnosis based on the exponential decay would be 
possible. 
A further study on the quantity index based on the 
exponential decay of bearing vibration at running speed 
1600 rpm is shown in Table 4. Similar to the increasing 
trend in Table 3, the exponential decay are rapidly 
increased with the number of resonance mode. In addition, 
the averages of the exponential decay for the normal 
bearing are also smaller than those for defect types of 
bearing. Thus, it proves a quantity index for the bearing 
defect diagnosis could be the exponential decay.

applied in the envelope detection for a vibration signal
