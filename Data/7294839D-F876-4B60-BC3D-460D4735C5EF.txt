variable structure system scheme to design 
robust positioning controller for systems in 
macro-dynamic stages. On the other hand, the 
evolutionary programming (EP) algorithm has 
been considered as an available and promising 
technique for deriving global optimization 
solutions of complex functions, and also has 
been applied to solve difficult problems in the 
field of control engineering [5-6].  Generally, 
the EP algorithm for global optimization 
contains four parts: initialization, mutation, 
competition, and reproduction.  In this project, 
the EP algorithm is used for determining the 
optimal control gains of PID controller for the 
controlling in the static friction stage. In 
particular, the effect of linear input is 
considered and released due to the proposed 
control scheme. Finally, a two-stage controller 
is proposed to cope with the robust positioning 
control problem for linear motors.

To describe the dynamic friction behavior, 
the equations of linear DC motor are shown 
below: 
 
Electrical equation: xkRiiLv eaaa && ++=  (1) 
Dynamic equation: fxBxMikF af ++== &&&      (2) 
 
where x  is the linear displacement of the 
slider (m). fkBM ,, and ek represent the mass 
of the slider(kg), viscous damping factor(N/v), 
force constant(N/A), back EMF 
constant(V/ms-1), respectively. The 
parameters Riv aa ,, and L are the input 
voltage(V), armature current(A), motor 
resistance( Ω ) and armature inductance(H), 
respectively. Equations (1) and (2) can be as 
the macro-dynamic model of linear DC motors. 
For tracking control purpose, we define the 
error state as 
 xxe d −=         (3) 
where dx  is the desired system displacement. 
Then the following error equation is obtained 
from Eqs. (1)-(3) as

linear DC motor 
Suppose we select a switching function

the PID controller should be capable to 
implement the position control in 
microdynamic region. Consequently, we 
introduce EP algorithm to develop a optimal 
PID controller for the position control in 
microdynamic region. 
 
 
Fig. 2  The static friction model 
 
The PID control system consists of the 
linear motor to be controlled, a PID controller 
and an EP algorithm, as shown in Fig. 3. The 
controlled plant is the dynamics of the linear 
DC motor in the static friction stage with input 
nonlinearity. dx  is the desired output, x  is the 
plant output, and u is the control input 
generated by the PID controller. The PID 
controller is proposed with the optimal 
parameters derived from the EP algorithm such 
that the value of IAE is minimized as possibly. 
In this study, the IAE index is used as the 
objective function, which is given as   
( ) ττ deIAE ∫∞=
0
.                                  (18) 
Problem formulation 
Let z be the continuously differentiable 
matrix-valued function defined for Sz ∈ , where 
}3,2,1,0{ 3 =∞≤≤∈= izRzS i .  The 
optimization problem involves finding 
SKKKz dip ∈= ],,[* ***  such that the performance 
index of IAE of system is minimized.  More 
accurately, the optimization problem is stated 
mathematically as 
(P1): To find Sz ∈*  such that 
( ) ττ deIAE ∫∞=
0
 for Sz∈    (19) 
is minimized.” 
Based on the results shown by [5, 6], the 
extended EP algorithm for solving the above 
optimization problem is described as follows: 
I. Generate an initial population 
P p p pN0 1 2= [ , , , ]K of size N by 
randomly initializing each 3-dimensional 
solution vector NiSpi ,,2,1, K=∈ , 
according to the quasi-random sequence 
(QRS). 
II. Calculate the fitness score (objective 
function) f f pi i= ( )  for every 
Nipi ,,2,1, K= , where  
ττ depf i ∫∞=
0
)()( , [ ] SpKKK idip ∈=,, .         (20) 
III. Mutate every p i Ni , , ,= 1 K , based on the 
statistics to double the population size 
from N to 2N, and generate pi N+  in the 
following 
3,2,1),,0(,, =∀+=

where pi j,  denotes the jth element of the

every fitness scores, and β  is a parameter 
to scale f
f

∑
. 
IV.  Calculate the fitness score f i N+  for every 
Nip Ni ,,2,1, K=+  by using equation (20). 
By the stochastic competition process, 
Nipi ,,2,1, K= , competes with 
p j N Nj , , ,= + 1 2K , randomly each 
other.  If  ji ff < , ip  is the winner and 
survives; otherwise, p j  is the winner and 
pi  is replaced by p j .  After the 
competition process, we select the N 
winners for the next generation and let the 
individual with the minimum objective 
function in the winners be 1p . 
IV. If the value ∑f  converges to a minimum 
value, then 1
* pz =  is the global optimum 
value and ],,[* *** dip KKKz =  is such that 
the performance index of IAE of system is 
minimized as possibly.  Otherwise, return 
to Step III.
