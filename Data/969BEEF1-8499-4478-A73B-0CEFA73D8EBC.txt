本計畫為整合型計畫(非侵入式評估心室儲備功能系統之研發)之第三個子計畫，主要研
發一可定性定量之呼吸裝置以及一可連續量測血管體積變化的裝置，並結合其它子計畫所
研製的裝置、系統軟硬體整合平台、及臨床評估和心室儲備功能相關臨床參數之分析，以
期發展成一套非侵入式的心室儲備功能之評估系統。本研究計畫為三年期的第三年，除改
進呼吸測量裝置的硬體電路外，更改良阻抗式血流量擷取裝置，以便進行橈動脈血管體積
變化的量測，並完成臨床測試及數據分析的工作。 
 
我們利用阻抗體積描記技術，以四極固定電流源(100KHz)方式獲得連續性之血管阻抗
變化，推估出時變之動脈血流波形。由校準曲線上發現，自製的血管體積變化擷取裝置之
定電流輸出與感測之精密阻值，具有頗佳的線性度（r2=0.999）。為驗證所研製的血管體積
量測裝置之性能及校準其可行性，我們共完成了(1)改變左心室負載的實驗、(2)運動實驗及
(3)短期憋氣的臨床實驗。在三十次交互蹲跳之運動實驗中，十二位受測者運動後的橈動脈
血流波形平均振幅（3.19±1.01 Volts），顯著高於穩態（1.98±0.61 Volts）時的波形平均振
幅（p<0.01）；在 30 秒憋氣的臨床實驗中，十四位受測者穩態之血流平均振幅為 1.89±0.53 
Volts，相較於憋氣後之平均振幅為 2.26±0.42 Volts，在統計上具有顯著的差異（p<0.01）。
同時以即時二維超音波系統（SONOS-7500）所測得的心搏量，來作為本論文血流量擷取裝
置之挍準值，結果顯示，由超音波量得之心搏量變化率與本裝置所測得之血管體積振幅變
化率之間，呈現線性相關性（r=0.79）。本論文已完成血流量及血壓裝置之研製，且成功應
用於動脈順應性之計算以及受測者心搏量連續變化之監測，並具有由周邊動脈壓力-體積迴
環圖推導出左心室收縮能力與順應性之潛能。 
 
我們也已將所研製的血管體積裝置和其它子計畫的軟體和硬體裝置，整合在一起，構
成一非侵入式心室儲備功能之評估系統。又，按照時程，於高雄榮總醫院完成血管體積裝
置之臨床測試結果，並進一步完成非侵入式血管體積和非侵入式超音波心搏量之比較。故，
綜觀本計畫的研究成果，已如期完成本年度所預定之各項研究目標。

１、完成呼吸硬體裝置之改良及測試 
為了使本子計畫所研製定性定量呼吸裝置的電路，達到穩定的效果，並具有可同時測
量吸入氣體及呼出氣體之壓力及流量大小的能力，我們採用振幅調變模式來量測呼吸訊
號。如圖一所示，為所研製呼吸裝置的整體功能方塊圖。由於呼吸訊號頻率非常低，以固
定電壓源所產生的1 kHz方波做為載波，並作為橋式電路之激發源，而由位於橋式電路之一
臂的熱敏電阻來感測呼吸訊號，而此熱敏電阻則是安裝於面罩上隨受測者呼吸時進出氣溫
之改變而量測呼吸的訊號。經由儀表放大器(AD620)將熱敏電阻上的電壓降放大約50倍，再
經兩階的高通濾波器(fc=0.01Hz)濾除直流雜訊，及由四階的低通濾波器(fc=3Hz) 濾除高頻
訊號, 以便分離出呼吸的變化訊號，並藉由積分電路把波型曲線加以積分，最後透過類比
轉換器(A/D)，將數位訊號送入電腦，以利後序處理及分析。如圖二所示，為本研究改良後

Comparison of the arterial stiffness between hypertensive and normotensive patients has been 
made in recent years [1-5], but whether the arterial compliance in the established hypertension is 
reduced remains still controversial.  Some of the previous results indicated that hypertension tends 
to decrease arterial elasticity due to thickening of the arterial wall [6,7].  These opposite findings 
may result first from using different experimental protocols and subjects, such as human or animal.  
Secondly, the compliance of the arterial wall is not constant for whole cardiac cycles but possibly 
varies with arterial pressure.  Third, the assumption that the cross-section of the artery always 
remains circular in determining arterial segment volume regardless of dilatation or contraction is 
not completely correct.     
To calculate arterial compliance requires simultaneous measurement of arterial blood 
pressure and arterial volume. Obviously, more challenges are encountered once the compliance is 
obtained in a non-invasive manner.  Although difficult, a number of methods for noninvasively 
measuring arterial compliance have been proposed, including the tonometry [5,8,9], oscillometry 
[10,11], ultrasound [12,13], plethysmography [14], photo-plethysmography[15,16], impedance 
[17,18], and so forth.   Most of the methods proposed can only provide an indirect determination of 
arterial acompliance using non-invasive physical conversion.  For instance, in the impedance 
method, a change in arterial segment volume is translated from a change in arterial segment 
impedance.   
 There are little studies regarding with the relationship between the arterial compliance in the 
literature [19,20].   It is most accepted that there is a nonlinear relation between the arterial pressure 
and compliance.  Therefore, it is worthwhile further exploration into the compliance-pressure 
relation in human arteries.      
   Therefore, the purpose of the study is to explore the relationship between the radial vessel 
volume and the radial arterial pressure, to determine the global compliance of the radial aterial wall 
in the normotensive subjects, and to establish the arterial compliance to pressure relationship in the

underlying arterial pressure.  Four electrodes (alloy of gold and copper) were in parallel disposed 
across the tonometer’s compartment to detect the variation of the fluid distribution inside the 
compartment.   For the purposes of convenience, most parts of the tonometer were designed to be 
separable and the compliant diaphragm is designed to be interchangeable. 
When the arterial tonometer was utilized, it was necessary to make an effective contact with a 
superficial artery through a medium, that is, the flexible diaphragm.  To realize this, a strip bandage 
was used to immobilize the tonometer such that a maximal swing in output voltage showed up.  To 
elevate the sensitivity of the tonometer, the short axis of the elliptical opening was required to be 
centralized over the underlying artery of interest.  The pressure inside the compartment was 
measured by means of a pressure sensor (NPI-12, Lucas, USA) that was connected to the 
compartment.   
 
2.3. Data Recording and Analysis  
The change in the arterial segment volume was measured by the impedance plethysmography 
[5].  In the method, a constant-current source was connected to the tow external electrodes.  When 
the electric current left from one electrode, passed through the conductive fluid (here saline) 
between the two electrodes and entered into the other electrode, a voltage difference was induced 
between the two inner electrodes.  In addition, the voltage difference was varied with the saline 
distribution in the chamber.   The electric resistance, R, corresponds to the space between the two

Here, we defined the arterial global compliance (Cg) as the difference between the maximum and 
minimum vessel volumes divided by pulse pressure, as follows:

It is also believed that a non-linear relation exists between the arterial blood pressure and the 
arterial volume.  In the study, we assume the arterial blood pressure (P) is logarithmically related to 
the arterial volume [V(P)], as follows: 
    |)(|ln )( 321 KPKKPV −+=                                                        (5) 
where K1, K2 and K3 are three constants. The elastic properties of the arterial wall have been found 
to be a function of blood pressure [2]. Due to a wide range of pressure, the compliance may vary 
considerably. Here, relationship between the arterial global compliance [C(P)] and arterial pressure 
was assumed to be logarithmic.  For instance, a natural logarithm equation together with three 
constants a, b and c, as expressed in (6), may govern the compliance-pressure relation. 
|)(|ln)( cPbaPC −+=                                                                     (6) 
The radial arterial blood pressure and vessel volume change in the ten subjects were measured 
with the tonometer. For simplicity and convenience, the values of vessel volume and compliance 
were determined, at a step of 5 mm Hg, from diastolic pressure (65 mm Hg) to systolic pressure 
(110 mm Hg). The analog signals corresponding to the arterial blood pressure and volume were 
digitized by a 12-bit converter, respectively, with a sampling frequency of 200 Hz, and recorded 
using the MP 100 Manager (BIOPAC System Inc., USA). Subsequent data analysis was carried out 
with a personal computer.

waveform for each heartbeat corresponded well to those of the arterial blood pressure waveform, 
respectively.        
Table 1 shows the hemodynamic variables measured from the ten young normotensive 
subjects.  Their systolic and diastolic pressures are 110 ± 5 and 67 ± 7 mm Hg, respectively.  Also, 
the pulse pressure (the difference between the systolic and diastolic pressures), and the pulse 
volume (ΔV) defined here as the difference between the maximum and minimum of the radial 
arterial segment volumes, are found to be 43 ± 5 mm Hg and 0.202 ± 0.126 mL, respectively.  
There exists a wide range, from 1.961 to 8.818 uL/mmHg, of the arterial global compliance (Cg) in 
those subjects with an average of 4.645 uL/mmHg.  
          The linearity between the arterial blood pressure and the arterial segment volume was 
investigated.  In the period during which the aorta valve opens, a linear relationship (correlaton 
coefficient = 0.94) is present between the arteral blood pressure and volume, as shown in Fig. 5(a).  
Fig. 5(b) shows that there is a smaller linear regression coefficient (0.84) between the arterial 
pressure and volume for the period during which the aorta valve is closed.  An arterial pressure-
volume loop is depicted in Fig. 5(c), which develops in clockwise direction and appears less smooth 
in the presence of dicrotic nothes, as compared with cardiac pressure-volume loops.       
      When the vessel volume data and arterial blood pressure data are determined at a step of 5 
mmHg in the ascending portion, the relation between them is of a natural logarithmic form, as 
shown in Fig. 6.  According to (5), a high correlation coefficient (0.996) is obtained by non-linear 
regression analysis and meanwhile the three parameters (K1, K2 and K3) are found to be 0.227, 
0.153 and 56.096, respectively.  In the figure, it is likely that the arterial segment volume is 
positively propostional to the arterial blood pressure.  
     The arterial wall compliance-pressure curve using all subjects’ data is shown in Fig. 7.  
When the relation between the compliance and pressure is fit in the natural logarithmic form as 
expressed in (6), a correlation coefficient and the three parameters (a, b and c) are determined to be 
附件二 
 11
      According to the relation between the arterial blood pressure and arterial segment volume (Fig. 
6), it is likely that for a wide range of arterial pressure, the arterial segment volume relates 
logrithrimically to the arterial pressure, as compared with the linear relationship in Fig. 5.  In the 
study, the nonlinear arterial pressure-volume relation determined is consistent with previous reports 
[2,22,23]. 
Several previous results have shown that the arterial compliance (the change in diameter 
divided by change in pressure) decreased with the internal pressure (or the transmural pressure, 
assuming a zero outside pressure) of the artery [6,11].  Here, we calculated the arterial wall 
compliance by dividing the change in vessel volume by change in arterial pressure, as defined in (3).  
We found that the arterial compliance is not constant but pressure-dependent, as shown in Fig. 7.  
Noticeably, the arterial compliance decreases with the pressure.  In other words, the arterial wall 
displays more compliant at diastolic pressure than at systolic pressure.  Futhermore, a natural 
logarithmic form fits pretty well the arterial compliance-pressure relationship. Due to the nonlinear 
relationship between the compliance and pressure, taking the level of pressure into account is 
always necessary as comparing two compliances obtained from distinct physiological situations.   
 
5. CONCLUSION 
Noninvasive determination of the dynamic arterial wall compliance in normotensive subjects 
was performed in the current investigation.  The arterial global compliance, calculated as the ratio 
of maximum change in arterial volume and pulse pressure, may be a convincing parameter for 
characterizing the arterial stiffness, although pressure-dependent.  The current results show that the 
arterial vessel volume varies with the arterial blood pressure logarithmicly and positively, whereas a 
logarithmic and negative relation between the arterial global compliance and arterial blood pressure 
is present in human radial arteries.  Moreover, it is suggested that when we would like to make a 
comparison between two arterial wall compliances in different physiological situations, they should

Abstract- The purpose of the study is to investigate the 
effect of thrombolysis on the relationship between the left 
ventricular (LV) maximum elastance (Emax) and effective 
arterial elastance (Eart) in 20 patients with acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI).  LV pressures and volumes of 
the patients were measured with Millar and multi-electrode 
volume conductance catheters during catheterization 
examination, respectively, at the first week and 3 months 
after the thrombolytic treatment.  Emax was represented by 
the slope of the LV end-systolic pressure-volume relation, 
and Eart by the slope of the arterial end-systolic pressure-
stroke volume relation.  The results showed a linear Emax to 
Eart relation (r = 0.59) at the 1st week, but not 3 months (r 
=0.20),  in those post-AMI patients.  Moreover, the Emax 
was found to be linearly proportional to the Emax/Eart ratio 
at both the 1st week (r = 0.88) and 3 months (r = 0.85) after 
thrombolytic therapy. In summary, a ‘stunt’ hearts in the 
initial period after thrombolytic intervention reveals a linear 
relationship between the ventricular contractility and 
afterload, suggesting that the coupling of the left ventricle 
and arterial vasculature seems to be maintained.    
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 
Left ventricular (LV) pumping efficiency is related to 
its contractility and afterload [1-3].  LV elastacne (Emax), 
determined with the slope of the LV end-systolic 
pressure-volume relation, is considered as a load-
independent, inotropy-sensitive index for the LV 
contractility. Kelley and his coworkers have indicated 
that the effective arterial elastance (Eart), calculated by 
the slope of the arterial end-systolic pressure-stroke 
volume relation, is a reliable index for the arterial 
vascular load [4].   
In most cases, patients will receive thrombolytic 
therapy in 24 golden hours after an event of acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI) is properly diagnosed. In 
order to evaluate the prognosis of that treatment, it is 
essential to know its short- and long-term effects on the 
LV function. Among the LV hemodynamic variables, the 
stroke volume is most frequently used to assess the LV 
systolic function after the thrombolytic intervention, 
although it cannot completely explain the LV pump 
performance. So, to understand the alteration in both the 
LV chamber elastance and its afterload represented by 
Eart may be useful in evaluating the outcome of the 
thromolysis [5,6].   
Thus, the purpose of the present study is to explore 
whether the abnormal LV contractility and its afterload 
still exist and, to investigate the linearity between the LV 
chamber contractility and the arterial vascular load, and 
between the ventricular elastance and the 
ventriculoarterial coupling in AMI patients after 
thrombolytic therapy.     
 
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
 
Twenty subjects (19 men and 1 woman) with AMI 
aged 45~72 years who received thrombolytic treatment in 
the 24 golden hours after event at the Veterans General 
Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan were included in the study. 
Informed consent was obtained from each patient; the 
study protocol was approved by the Human Investigation 
Committee of the Veterans General Hospital.  
LV pressures and volumes of those patients during 
catheterization surgery were respectively measured with 
Millar catheters and multi-electrode volume conductance 
catheters at the 5 ~ 7th day and at three months after the 
intravenous thrombolysis. The venous return of the left 
ventricle was reduced by means of a tip-balloon catheter 
located at the lower vena cava.   
As shown in Figure 1, the LV elastance (Emax) that is 
referred as an index of ventricular contractility is equal to 
the slope of the LV end-systolic pressure-volume relation.  It 
can be determined with (1), where ESV is the end-
systolic volume, ESP the end-systolic pressure, and Vo 
the dead volume.  The effective arterial elastance (Eart) 
corresponding to the LV afterload, is represented by the 
slope of the arterial end-systolic pressure-stroke volume 
relation.  It can be calculated using (2), where EDV is the 
end-diastolic volume, and EDP the end-diastolic pressure.

IV. DISCUSSION 
 
The slope of end-systolic pressure-volume relation 
has been widely utilized as a reliable index for LV 
contractility, due to its load-independent property.  In the 
study, we determine the Emax, a reliable index for LV 
contractility, using multiple pressure-volume loops 
obtained with reduced venous return by vena cava 
occlusion.   We find the Emax in those 20 patients with 
AMI ranges broadly from 0.50 to 2.24 (with an average 
of 1.10) in the initial stage, and from 0.32 to 2.30 (with an 
average of 1.20) mmHg/ml in the long-term stage after 
thrombolysis.  It is obvious that both average values from 
the infarcted hearts are declined, as compared with 
normal human cardiac contractility (3.51 mmHg/ml) [6].  
Here, the LV afterload is shown to be equivalent to the 
the effective arterial elastance that can be determined 
using the slope of the arterial end-systolic pressure-stroke 
volume relation [4]. The current results show that 
averages of Eart at the first week (1.58 ± 0.34) and at the

3 months (1.67 ± 0.51 mmHg/ml) in post-AMI patients 
are both smaller than that in normal human hearts [6]. 
Although the Emax as well as the Eart are decreased, 
the current study demonstrates a lieart relationship 
betwee them only in the early period but not in the long-
term period after thrombolytic treatment.   The linearity 
becomes extinct in the long-term outcome, which can be 
partially explained by the LV remodeling and autonomic 
modulation. 
When the ventriculoarterial coupling is represented by 
the ratio of Emax/Eart, we acquire a coupling index of    
0.69  for the first week and  0.75 for the 3 months in post-
AMI condition.  Both ratios of the Emax/Eart are much 
smaller than the theoretical value, unity, for generating 
LV maximum stroke work [2].  Although the LV optimal 
stroke work occurs in theory when the Emax is equal to 
the Eart, one previous report has shown that normal 
human hearts may operate at an Emax/Eart ratio of 1.62 
[6].

Abstract- We propose new contractility indexes, in the 
work, which are equivalent to the conventional contractility 
(Ees) determined with the slope of left ventricular (LV) end-
systolic pressure-volume relation.  Nineteen patients with 
acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were recruited in the 
study.  They received thrombolytic therapy within 24 hours 
after the AMI event, and their LV pressures and volumes 
were measured with Millar and multi-electrode volume 
conductance catheters during catheterization examination at 
the first week and 3 months, respectively. The first 
equivalent contractility index (eEsv) submitted was defined 
as the Ees divided by the end-systolic volume (ESV) and 
normalized to 100 ml, the second (eEdv) as the Ees divided 
by the end-diastolic volume (EDV) and normalized to 100 ml, 
and the third  (eEmv) as the Ees divided by the midrange of 
the LV volume and normalized to 100 m.  Using linear 
regression methods, we found that a high correlation 
coefficient (r > 0.82) exists between the Ees and one of the 
three new contractility indexes.  Furthermore, the eEsv but 
not Ees was significantly higher measured at 3 months than 
at one week after thrombolysis. In conclusion, an increase in 
the equivalent contractility eEsv implies the improvement of 
the left ventricular systolic function in the post-AMI human 
hearts long-term after thrombolytic intervention, as the size-
dependence of contractility is taken into account. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 
Left ventricular (LV) contractility not only affects its 
systolic function directly, but also is intimately associated 
with various heart diseases.  Thus, it is always necessary 
to search for a dependable index for assessing ventricular 
contractility in human hearts.  Suga and Sagawa have 
successfully demonstrated a contractility index that is 
determined with the slope (Ees) of the LV end-systolic 
pressure-volume relation [1-3].  Up to now, the Ees is 
considered to be the most reliable index as the LV 
contractility, because of its preload- and afterload-
independence, and inotropy-sensitivity [1,4].  
A number of investigations have shown that the Ees 
cannot be kept constant as a great change in LV preload 
or afterload is imposed [5,6].  In addition, higher LV end-
systolic elastance is shown in small hearts of animals than 
in human hearts [7,8].  The LV contractility represented 
by Ees may possibly be a heart size-sensitive.  In other 
words, the Ees may become dependent of LV volume.   
Remodeling and deformation of LV configuration 
may happen in human hearts with acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI) [9,10].  It is thus important to know 
whether the systolic functin in human hearts with post-
AMI improves or not, after instantly thrombolytic 
intervention.  
Therefore, the purpose of the present study is: (1) to 
propose size-dependent contractility indexes and compare 
them with the traditional one, and (2) to apply the new 
indexes for evaluating whether the LV systolic function 
in post-AMI patients after thrombolytic treatment is 
enhanced or not. 
 
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
 
A. Experimental Protocol 
The study recruited nineteen AMI patients (18 
men and 1 woman, averaged 66 ± 6 years) who 
underwent thrombolytic intervention intravenously in the 
first 24 hours after event at the Veterans General Hospital, 
Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Informed consent was obtained from 
each patient; the study protocol was approved by the 
Human Investigation Committee of the Veterans General 
Hospital.  
Continuous LV pressure and volume waveforms of 
those patients during catheterization surgery were 
respectively recorded by Millar catheters and multi-
electrode conductance catheters at the first week and at 3 
months after the thrombolysis. To obtain different 
pressure-volume loops, LV preload was gradually 
changed by occlude the lower vena cava by means of a 
tip-balloon catheter.   
 
B. Determination of Traditional Ees 
The traditionally used index, Ees, for the LV 
contractility was determined from the slope of the LV 
end-systolic pressure-volume relation, as shown in Fig. 1.  
The relation between the Ees and LV hemodynamic 
variables is expressed in (1), where ESV is the end-
systolic volume, ESP the end-systolic pressure, and Vo 
the dead volume when the left ventricle can no longer 
produce pressure.

C. New Contractility Indexes 
To calibrate the LV contractility due to the diverse 
LV volume, we here proposed three equivalent 
contractility indexes. As depicted in (2), the ESV-
equivalent contractility index, eEsv, is determined from 
the traditional maximum elastance divided by ESV and 
then multiplied by 100. Similarly, the EDV-equivalent 
contractility index, eEdv, is defined as the LV traditional 
elastance divided by EDV and then multiplied by 100, as 
expressed in (3).  The midrange volume-equivalent 
contractility index, eEmv, is calculated by the 
traditionally determined elastance divided by the half of 
the sum of EDV and ESV, and then multiplied by 100, as 
illustrated in (4).

IV. DISCUSSION 
 
The slope of LV end-systolic pressure-volume 
relation, Ees, has been widely used as an index for the 
ventricular contractility in the world, due to its preload- 
and afterload-independent property.  As we have known, 
hearts of smaller animals correspond to a larger value of 
that contractility index, while larger-size human or animal 
hearts have conversely smaller Ees [7,8].  It is obvious 
that the conventionally used contractility index is a size-
dependent index. Therefore, in the study we propose three 
equivalent contractility indexes normalized to the 
different LV volumes, including the LV end-systolic, the 
end-diastolic and the midrange of LV volumes.

The results show that the three new contractility 
indexes are parallel to the conventional Ees measured in 
the 19 post-AMI patients after medical thrombolysis.   
Moreover, high correlation coefficients (r > 0.80) indicate 
that a linear relationship exists between the Ees and one 
of the three equivalent contractility indexes not only at 
the first week but also at 3 months in the post-AMI 
condition.  The finding shows the usefulness of the three 
new contractility indexes in evaluating the LV contratile 
function.  Of course, more researches on the comparison 
betwee the new and conventional contractility indexes are 
required to support its feasibility and applicability.

Abstract 
  
We should pay more attention to the 
respiratory function, because the air pollution 
problem is serious and the polluted air can 
directly cause a big damage to our lungs.  
Unfortunately, most of the lung function 
devices are imported and expensive.  Thus, it 
is essential for us to design an inexpensive, 
convenient, but still accurate device for 
monitoring the respiration activities. The 
purpose of the work is to establish a respiration 
monitoring device based on the 
amplitude-modulation (AM) method. In the 
device, a constant voltage source used to excite 
a thermistor was modulated by one kHz square 
waves. The thermistor inside a mask was used 
to sense the change in temperature of the 
breathing air. We found that the AM method is 
available for successfully monitoring subject’s 
inspiratory and expiratory signals
