particularly on the quantitative data of
morphology, in the electroosmotic
dewatering, are still largely lacking.
Yang et al. [in [press] proposed a
mathematical model for quantitatively
describing the electroosmotic flow in
wet materials subjected to external
electrical potential. This paper briefly
summarized the elements composing of
the model, and the numerical scheme to
quantitative describe fluid flow in a wet
materials.
Numerical modeling
1. Mesh
The real structure of an original
floc was scanned in CLMS and images
of its cross-sections were scanned and
converted into bileveled ones, as shown
in Fig. 1 (a). A series of such bileveled
images were used to construct 3-D
meshes of the floc (Fig. 1(b) ) following
the procedures developed by our group
[i,ii,iii,iv].
The porosity of the floc is 0.72.
More than 100,000 tetrahedral grids
were used to fill into the pore volume of
floc which constitutes the computational
domain. The open pore area on one
side of sample cubic in the y-direction is
set as the inlet while the other in the
opposite direction is set as the outlet; the
remaining four sides are set as
impermeable walls to ensure a
conservative flowrate through the
sample.
2. Governing equations
The non-dimensional governing
equations for a Newtonian, steady flow
in the pore volume of sludge floc are as
follows.
(a) Continuity equation
0 U (1)
(b) Momentum equation
  TUU  PRe (2)
where U is the non-dimensional velocity
vector, and can be written as
0u

operator is

 00luRe . u, v, and w are
velocity components in the x-, y- and
z-directions, respectively. , and p are
the fluid density, viscosity and pressure,
respectively. l0 is the edge length of the
floc cubic, which is equal in all
directions. u0 is a Smoluchowski
velocity for electroosmotic flow,
determined by
Eu Wr

0
0  (3)
where 0 = 8.85410-12 (F/m) is the
vacuum permittivity, r = 80 the relative
permittivity of water, (= 22.5 mV for
the sludge in this paper) zeta potential
on the floc wall, and E the electric field
intensity along the surface. Using Eq. (3)
to model electroosmotic flows holds
valid when the thickness of electric
double layer (EDL) is quite small
compared to the channel scale, for
example, smaller than 1/50 of the
channel width [v]. Considering that the
typical EDL thickness ranges from 1 to
100 nm, the channel width that makes
the Smoluchowski equation valid, by a
conservative
estimation, is above 50 times of the
super limit of the EDL width, i.e., 5m.
A pore-size distribution (PSD) test [vi]
was ran to reveal that cross-sections of
the original floc considered here has
over 95% of its area in pores larger than
the inlet and outlet, respectively. um is
the mean velocity, which is determined
by
2

l
Su
u Sm

 (9)
where u is the velocity normal to the
cross-section, and S the area of the
cross-section.
Figure 5 shows permeability of
pure electroosmotic flows and
pressure-driven flows. Note that the
Reynolds number for a pressure-driven
flow is defined as
 

 00 luGRe  (10)
which is G times that defined for a
electroosmotic flow. Pressure-driven
flows at Reynolds numbers as large as
50,000 is still laminar, which seems
contradictive to the classical conclusion
that flows under such large Reynolds
numbers are turbulent. However, the
disagreement is caused by a different
definition of the Reynolds number here.
The Reynolds number defined in Eq. (10)
is based on a velocity (Gu0) much larger
than the true velocity inside the floc,
which causes the over-large Reynolds
number for pressure-driven flows in Fig.
5. The reason why the Reynolds number
defined by Eq. (10) is wanted is that it
will provides convenience for
establishing an theoretic expression for
flowrate in the following sections.
Prediction of flowrate from

The Non-dimensional flowrate is
defined as

 (11)
where is the porosity. From Eqs. (1)
and (2), it is easy to see that the
governing equation is linear when Re is
small and the left side term of Eq. (2) is
therefore negligible. Under such
conditions, a flow subject to both
electroosmosis and a pressure gradient
can be subdivided in to two individual
flows, and the flowrate is a sum of those
of the electroosmotic and
pressure-driven flows. The portion of
flowrate induced by electroosmosis is
predicted as

To calculate Q through Eq. (16), KEM
and Kp can be obtained from Fig. 5. In a
flow with Re0 and G0, the value of KEM
is directly sought at Re = Re0 and the
value of Kp is obtained at Re = Re0G0.
Figure 6 shows the non-dimensional
flowrate obtained both by numerical
(solving the full equations) and by Eq.
(16) (assuming a low Reynolds number).
From the figure, it is seem that Eq. (16)
can precisely predict the flowrate under
Re = 10. The deviation between Eq. (16)
and the numerical results is caused by
the non-linear term, i.e., the left term in
Eq. (2), which becomes significantly as
the Reynolds number surpasses 10.
