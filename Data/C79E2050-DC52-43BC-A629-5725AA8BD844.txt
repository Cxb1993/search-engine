研究方法 
本研究對於三維影像進行分享，也衍生出關於視覺密碼學的分存管理研究和
其實務上的應用，但是因為篇幅有限，本報告對三維資料分享方法進行說明，並
將其他衍生相關研究展示於下一段。 
三維網格模型可定義為M={V,C}，其中端點V={vi|, i=0,1,…N-1, vi=(xi,yi,zi)}，
連結關係 C={(ik,jk)| k=0,....,m-1, 0 ≤ ik ≤ N −1 , 0 ≤ jk ≤ N −1 }，連結關係可能為線、面
或是體的關係，如果將分享方法以函式形式表示，分存的產生方式稱為 E，則對
分享函式 E輸入原始三維網格M、分存數量 n與還原門檻 r，可以得到 n個分存
S={S1,S2,….Sn}即如方程式(1)所示 
S=E(M,r,n)                           (1) 
在設計分享函式時，觀察輸入參數，M={V,C}，其中V 為端點座標，常為3 個
浮點數代表(x,y,z)三個方向的分量，C 常見為面的關係，常見以點的編號與面的
編號為關係，因此， 
有三個方向可以考慮如何設計分享函式: 
(1) 對端點資料進行分享 
(2) 對連結關係進行分享 
(3) 同時對點與面進行分享 
 
[三維分享方法]

B. Random Grid Approach 
Kafri and Keren [12] presented three similar algorithms for 
image encryption applying random grids method. Precisely, 
the binary secret image I with the size of h×w will be 
encrypted into two cipher-grids S1 and S2 with the same size 
as that of I. First, the cipher-grid S1 is created by randomly 
assigning each pixel the color 0 or 1, i.e., white and black. 
Secondly, the other cipher-grid S2 will be created by referring 
to both the secret image I and the cipher-grid S1 using one of 
Kafri and Keren’ s three algorithms. Afterwards in 2008, 
Chen and Tsao[13] proposed an extension principle that the 
algorithms mainly consist of three properties: (1) 
randomization, (2) complement, and (3) equivalence for 
general operation. 
An example result[15] is shown in Fig.3. Fig.3(a) is the first  
original image. It is a pretty girl’s photograph. Fig.3(b) is 
another original image. The content of the second original 
image is the girl’s name. Fig. 3(c) and (d) are the two shares. 
Fig. 3(e) is the stack result of Fig.3 (c) and (d). Fig. 3 (f) is the 
stack result obtained after fig.3 (d) being overturned.

and (d) are shares, (e) is the result that stack (c) and (d), (f) is stack (c) and 
reveries (d) 
C. Probability Approach 
Yang[16] proposed a visual secret sharing method by 
probability approach. The method includes three steps: (1) 
translate the two basis matrices generated by ref.1 into one-
dimension arrays. (2) scan whole secret image (3) paint the 
transparencies by select one of the corresponding one-
dimension array randomly.  
Using the probabilistic method[16], Fang[17,18] continued to 
try to develop a non expansion visual secret sharing method 
that enables the size of secret image to be equal to that of the 
share size. Fig.4 showed that it was possible to make the size 
of secret equal to that of the share. For visual effect, this 
method can achieve the maximum size of secret image; 
however, the disadvantage is that it cannot get original data 
ironically just due to the probabilistic method.

Abstract— It is popular to use mobile phone daily in modern 
life. Among the numerous applications provided by mobile 
phone, barcode utility is one of the important branches. Many 
companies supply barcode tools for mobile phones. For 
example, Google's mobile Android operating system supports 
QR codes by natively including the barcode scanner in some 
models, and the browser supports URI redirection function 
which allows QR codes to send metadata to the applications on 
the device. After investigated the supplied applications on 
mobile devices, most of the products exhibit information 
accessible to every user. Differ from the traditional 
applications of QR Code. This paper proposes an offline 
authentication mechanism for QR codes. Based on the 
technology of visual cryptography, it is possible to check the 
identity accessing to the QR codes and to control the 
permission to the protected data.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Now, with the development of the Internet technology, 
various bar code symbols have been developed rapidly. QR 
(Quick Response) code [1], is usually used to specify the 
URL of the Internet web services. QR Code was 
standardized as the JIS standard (X 0510) [2] in 2000 and 
revised in 2004. After that, it was also standardized 
internationally as an international standard ISO/IEC18004 in 
2001. This code is standardized nationally in Korea, China 
and Singapore [3], etc., and has been widely used as a global 
standard. The application of QR code has been developed, 
including both commercial tracking applications and 
convenience-oriented applications aimed at mobile phone 
users. QR codes can be used to display text to the user, to 
add a vCard contact to the user's device, to open a URI or to 
compose an email or text message. Users can also generate 
and print their own QR codes for others to scan and use by 
visiting one of several free QR code generating sites. QR 
codes storing addresses and URLs may appear in magazines, 
on signs, buses, business cards, or on some objects which 
users might need information. Users with a camera phone 
equipped with the reader application can scan the image of 
the QR Code to display text, contact information, connect to 
a wireless network, or open a web page in the phone's 
browser. This act of linking from physical world objects is 
known as a physical world hyperlink. 
 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: the 
introduction to QR Code is given in Section 2; the review of 
the basic visual secret sharing scheme is given in the Section 
3; the geometrical calibration method is presented in Section 
4; the proposed method is presented in Section 5; and the 
experimental results are demonstrated in Section 6; the 
conclusions are given in Section 7. 
 
II. INTRODUCTION TO QR CODE 
A QR code (Quick Response) is a specific matrix 
barcode, readable by dedicated QR barcode readers and 
camera phones. The code consists of black modules arranged 
in a square pattern on a white background. The information 
encoded can be text, URL or other data. There are six 
important features [4]: high capacity encoding of data, small 
printout size, Chinese/Japanese (kanji and kana) capability, 
dirt and damage resistance, readable from any direction in 
360° , and a structure append feature. Specifically, its 
capacity can encode 7089 numeric characters for numeric 
data.  
Each QR Code symbol should be constructed of 
nominally square modules set out in a regular square array 
and must consist of an encoding region and function 
patterns, namely finder, separator, timing patterns, and 
alignment patterns. Function patterns should not be used for 
the encoding of data. The symbol has to be surrounded on all 
four sides by a quiet zone border. Figure 1 illustrates the 
structure of a QR Code symbol in Version 7 specification.

Table 1 shows the main specifications of the QR code. 
There are four modes available, (1) number mode, (2)

f(x,y) = [f(1,0)−f(0,0)]×(x’−x0’) + [f(0,1)−f(0,0)]×(y’−y0’) +

End For 
Draw Finder pattern and alignment pattern 
B. Decoding phase 
There are two methods to decode: (1) capture the image 
after stack transparencies and image, and (2) stack the 
transparencies in pure electronic device. 
In the first case, the decoding method is shown as below: 
(1) stack transparencies and image directly, (2) capture the 
image, (3) remove redundancy black point, (4) detect finder 
patterns and alignment patterns, (5) calibration, and (6) 
retrieve information from QR Code by conversional method. 
In the second case, the decoding method includes (1) 
capture image, (2) stack the images by program, (3) remove 
redundancy black points, (4) detect finder pattern and 
alignment patterns, (5) calibration, (6) retrieve information 
from QR Code by conversional method. 
VI. EXPERIMENT RESULT 
Here, a QR code is first generated, the content of the QR 
code is the basic data of author. It is shown in Fig. 3. (a). 
This is a (2, 2) sharing case. The image and transparency are 
show in Figs. 3 (b) and (c). The stack result is shown as Fig.3 
(d). Figures 3(e) and 3(f) are the results that remove 
redundancy black points which stack manually and stack 
after capture.
