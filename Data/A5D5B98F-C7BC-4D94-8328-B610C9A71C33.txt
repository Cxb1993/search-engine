static-deformed shape functions of beam elements, called the consistent-mass method. The 
solutions of the discrete models can only approximate the actual dynamic behavior. Craig (1981) 
compared the natural frequencies of a uniform cantilever beam calculated by the exact 
continuous model with the solutions determined by the lumped-mass method and the 
consistent-mass method, and revealed that the accuracy of the natural frequencies calculated by 
the discrete models deteriorates in the higher modes. The continuous-model approach utilized in 
the dynamic analysis of a single beam element is recognized to be not feasible for the dynamic 
analysis of plane frames because the necessary boundary conditions become unmanageable 
(Chopra, 1995). 
From the differential equation of beam vibration, the relationships between harmonic forces 
and displacements at the ends of a beam element can be exactly established. These relations are 
usually referred to as the dynamic stiffness matrix. The elements in the dynamic stiffness matrix 
are nonlinear functions, trigonometric and hyperbolic, of vibration frequency. By expanding the 
dynamic stiffness matrix in a Taylor’s series, Paz (1973) demonstrated that the first term of the 
series, the zero power of frequency, is the static stiffness matrix, and the second term of the 
series, the second power of frequency, is the consistent mass matrix. After the dynamic stiffness 
matrices of beam elements are derived, the dynamic stiffness matrix of the whole frame can be 
assembled by exactly the same procedure used in the static matrix structural analysis. The 
historical development of using the dynamic stiffness matrix in structural dynamics has been 
highlighted by Akesson (1976). 
The dynamic stiffness matrix, which is frequency-dependent, can be directly employed in 
solving the steady-state response of the frames subjected to harmonic loadings. To solve the 
problems of transient response, the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the frames must be 
first calculated from the dynamic stiffness matrix, which is usually referred to as a nonlinear 
eigenproblem and is different from the linear eigenproblem encountered in the dynamic analysis 
of discrete systems. Extending the Sturm sequence property of linear eigenproblems, the 
Wittrick-Williams algorithm (Williams and Wittrick, 1970; Wittrick and Williams, 1971) can 
count the number of vibration modes exceeded by a specified frequency from the dynamic 
stiffness matrix, which ensures that no natural frequencies are missed when using the bisection 
or other methods (Kennedy and Williams, 1991) to solve the zero determinant equation of the 
dynamic stiffness matrix. 
The orthogonality of vibration modes is the required condition of using the vibration modes 
to solve the transient response of the frames. The publications on the orthogonality of vibration 
modes employed in the dynamic stiffness matrix are few and less rigorous (Chan and Williams, 
2000). The present paper derives the mode orthogonality condition of the Euler-Bernoulli plane

denoted as . The beam element J has two ends at joints i and j. Let dn iX , iY  and iM  denote 
the forces in the x  and y  directions and the moment, respectively, acting at the joint i of the 
element J. The transformation between the element local coordinates and the frame global

Similarly, the axial dynamic stiffness in Eq. (19) becomes infinitive when

For a single beam having both ends fixed in the axial direction, i.e., 0)()0( == Lχχ , the shape 
function in Eq. (15) becomes

To have a nontrivial shape function, Eq. (58) must be fulfilled. In other words, the frequencies 
solved from Eq. (58) are the natural frequencies of axial vibration in a single beam without axial 
displacement at ends, which will be called axial poles here. The nth solution of Eq. (58), anω , is

Difficulty in finding the natural frequencies of frames from Eq. (24) arises from the 
existence of element poles, but can be overcome by using the Wittrick-Williams algorithm 
(Williams and Wittrick, 1970; Wittrick and Williams, 1971). The algorithm states that )(ωfn , 
the total number of natural frequencies in a frame below a specific frequency ω , is given by 
)}({)()( ωωω Ksnn pf +=  (61) 
where )(ωpn  is the total number of axial and flexural poles in all elements of the frame below 
the frequency ω , and )}({ ωKs , the sign count of )(ωK , is the number of negative pivots in 
the diagonal matrix of pivots  after D )(ωK  is factorized as   
TLDLK =)(ω  (62) 
in which  is a lower triangular matrix with all diagonal elements being unity. L
By means of the bisection search method or other efficient methods (Kennedy and Williams, 
1991), the natural frequencies of the frame can be numerically solved from the determinant of 
the frame dynamic stiffness matrix

llnl cdK −=)(ω  (69) 
where lc , a vector of  dimensions, is the lth column of )1( −dn )( nωK with the lth element

T
nlln d
ddddd ]1[ 1121 −−= LLd  (70) 
where id  is the ith element in the vector ld . 
 One good choice of the deflated position l is the location where the absolute value of the 
pivot is the minimum in the pivot matrix  defined in Eq. (62). The accuracy of the calculated 
mode shape vector  can be checked by the residual vector  defined as  
D
nd r
nn dKr )(ω=  (71) 
If the norm of the residual vector is too large, select another deflated location l. 
 For the modes having  repeated roots, the space of the corresponding mode shape 
vectors is spanned by  orthogonal vectors. Use the deflated matrix approach in Eq. (69) to 
find  independent vectors. Then, apply the process of Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization to 
generate  orthogonal mode shape vectors which have  for . These mode 
shape vectors have to be checked by Eq. (71) to guarantee low residual. There are many sets of 
orthogonal vectors that span the vector space of the modes having repeated roots. For any set of 
orthogonal vectors solved through the Gram-Schmidt process, the values of  in Eq. (53) are 
usually negligible for  and the equations in Eq. (52) are decoupled for the same frequency 
but different orthogonal mode shapes.

10. Solution of null modes 
 
There is one type of vibration modes of which the natural frequency is also the axial or 
flexural poles of some beam elements in the frame. This type of vibration modes is called null 
modes here, because the corresponding mode shape vector in Eq. (68) is null, . Although 
the determinant of the frame dynamic stiffness matrix becomes infinite at the natural frequency 
of null modes, the Wittrick-Williams algorithm is still available to find null modes and solve the 
corresponding natural frequencies. The problem of null modes arises from failing to find the

adding an interior node to beam elements is unable to get rid of null mode of axial poles. 
In the null modes of axial poles with frequency anω , the axial force in the ith beam elements 
possessing axial pole has the form, derived from Eqs. (17) and (59),  
xexEAaxN i ααα coscos)( 2 ==  (77) 
with αEAaei 2=  being the magnitude of axial force in the ith axial-pole element. The axial 
forces acting at the ends of the ith axial-pole element become 
ieNN −=−= )0(0   ;   (78) ini eLeLNN )1(cos)(1 −=== α
where  because the corresponding frequency is nL )1(cos −=α anω  defined in Eq. (60). In 
terms of the magnitude of axial force, the shape function in Eq. (59) becomes 
x
EA
ex i ααχ sin)( =  (79) 
 In the null modes, the displacement vector  cannot be used as variables because it is null. 
Instead, the magnitudes of axial force in the beam elements possessing axial pole can be chosen 
as variables. If the null mode has  beam elements possessing axial pole in the frame, the 
magnitude vector  is a -dimensional vector formed by elements . After using Eq. (78) to 
calculate the end forces of all beam elements possessing axial pole, force equilibriums on all  
unconstrained degrees of freedom in the frame lead to

where  is a  rectangular matrix. Allowing row and column exchanges, the forward 
Gaussian elimination can decompose Eq. (80) into 
F ed nn ×

where  is a  upper triangular matrix with all diagonal elements being nonzero, and

(60) with . For the cross frame without hinge, the null modes of axial poles are 
double-roots. Fig. 6 shows the magnitudes of axial displacements of the modes corresponding to 
frequencies  and , plotted in the perpendicular direction of the beam axes. Because a 
middle node has been added to each beam, modes 24 and 25 corresponding to frequency 
m4=L

1aω  
are not null mode and their mode shape vectors are solved by the procedure described in section 
9. However, modes 39 and 40 corresponding to frequency 2aω  are null mode and their mode 
shape vectors are solved by the procedure described in section 10. For the cross frame with hinge, 
the null modes of axial poles are quadruple-roots. Fig. 7 shows the magnitudes of axial 
displacements of the modes corresponding to frequency 2aω . 
To study the effect of distributed mass, a vertical harmonic force  is applied at 
node 2 of the cross frame without hinge, and the vertical displacement at node 6 is calculated by 
the distributed-mass approach and the lumped-mass approach. In the lumped-mass approach, 
every beam is divided into four elements. Fig. 8 reveals that, if the input frequency  is 20Hz, 
the responses calculated by both approaches only have some variation in high frequency. 
However, if the input frequency 
kN sin tω
ω
ω  is increased to 40Hz, the response calculated by the 
distributed-mass approach is completely different from the response calculated by the 
lumped-mass approach as shown in Fig. 9. For the lumped-mass approach, increasing the 
number of divided elements in every beam can reduce the response difference from the 
distributed-mass approach. When every beam is divided into forty elements, the response by the 
lumped-mass approach is the same as the response of the distributed-mass approach. 
 
11.2. Example 2 
 
The two-story frame shown in Fig. 10(a) consists of six prismatic beams of 4 m length. 
Every beam has the same properties of , ,  and 
. Modal analysis indicates that the frame does not have any null mode of flexural 
poles or axial poles. However, if the axial deformation is neglected by increasing the beam area 
to  but keeping the same mass per length, i.e. 
29 N/m10=E 33 kg/m10=ρ 22 m10−=A
45 m10−=I
24 m10=A kg/m10=Aρ , the frame possesses the 
modes of which the natural frequencies equal to the flexural poles bnω  with . The 
residuals of these mode shapes are very high, which indicates that the frame needs additional 
middle nodes for every beam, as shown in Fig. 10(b), to eliminate the null modes of flexural 
poles. Fig. 11 depicts the shapes of modes 6 and 7 which have the same frequency as 
 and the shapes of modes 18 and 19 which have the same frequency as 
.

 The frame of Fig. 10(a) is subjected to a vertical harmonic force  at the center kN sin tω

superposition approach. Although the topic of the paper is limited to the Bernoulli-Euler plane 
frames, the theory and methodology presented hear can be extended to other types of frame, such 
as space frames and Timoshenko frames.
