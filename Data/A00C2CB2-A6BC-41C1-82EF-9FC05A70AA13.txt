英文摘要 
In this progress report, we focus on the study of the performance optimization 
techniques for the MB-OFDM systems as well as for the traditional OFDM systems. 
Two important issues have arisen in wireless OFDM-based systems – the channel gain 
estimation and the carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation. Channel estimation 
using preamble symbols is very important for demodulation and dynamic resource 
allocation in OFDM systems. However, if there is an interference source present, the 
preamble symbols may be corrupted by the interference. This will spoil the accuracy 
of channel estimation, and will result in severe degradation in the performance of the 
entire data frame. Based on this time-domain redundancy property we propose an 
adaptive select and replace (ASR) scheme to either partially or completely eliminate 
the interference in the time-domain; then, we propose an adaptive channel estimation 
scheme for multi-access interfering environments. By applying the proposed methods, 
multi-access interference can be efficiently eliminated and the estimation performance 
can be significantly improved under strong interference conditions. Furthermore, 
carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation is essential and crucial for OFDM systems, 
in order to prevent inter-carrier interference (ICI) and to maintain an acceptable 
performance. Conventional fractional CFO estimation can be classified into two 
categories: the pilot tone-aided (PTA) schemes and the cyclic prefix-based (CPB) 
schemes. In addition to the subcarriers dedicated for channel/frequency estimation, 
data subcarriers are also candidates that may be potentially used to improve the CFO 
estimation. In this work, we propose novel data-subcarrier aided CFO estimation 
algorithms, without the need of demodulating the data in advance, for M-PSK data 
modulated OFDM systems. According to the numerical and simulation results, it is 
found that the proposed algorithms can significantly improve the CFO estimation 
performance at the cost of an increase in computational complexity.

2. Adaptive Channel Estimation for MB-OFDM Systems in Multi-access 
Interfering Environments 
 
Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has drawn a lot of research interest 
in recent years owing to its outstanding characteristics for high data rate transmissions, 
including multi-path interference immunity and high spectral efficiency. The available 
spectrum is segmented into numerous separate narrow-band sub-channels, in which the 
selective fading phenomena of a channel occupying a large bandwidth become flat ones. With 
this property, OFDM can efficiently reduce the complexity of channel estimation and 
equalization in the receiver. Channel gain estimation plays an important role for signal 
reception, including coherent demodulation, decoding, and power allocation. Accurate 
channel estimation can significantly improve system performance and has been widely 
investigated in the literature [1]-[6].  
 
For most OFDM systems, each data frame is generally led by some preamble symbols 
used for timing synchronization, carrier frequency and sampling frequency adjustment, and 
channel estimation [7]-[10]. However, if there is an interference source present, the preamble 
symbols may be corrupted by the interference. This will spoil the accuracy of channel 
estimation, and will result in severe degradation in the performance of the entire data frame. 
For example, for multi-band OFDM (MB-OFDM) ultra-wideband (UWB) systems, multiple 
users can simultaneously use the same frequency band group by employing different 
time-frequency codes (TFCs) to provide frequency diversity and multiple access capability 
[11]. Hence, preamble symbols have a high possibility of being corrupted by multiple access 
interference.  
 
2.1. System and Channel Models 
A. System Model 
In MB-OFDM UWB systems, a piconet consists of a piconet coordinator (PNC) and 
multiple data devices (DEVs) [12]. It is assumed that there are multiple simultaneously 
operating piconets (SOPs) present in the same environment. All piconets are assumed to use 
the same band group with three bands, such as Band Group 1 [11]. To spread the transmission 
signals into three bands, each piconet uses a different time-frequency code (TFC), which 
provides frequency diversity, as well as channelization and multiple access capability among 
different piconets. Two types of TFCs are defined: one type interleaves the coded information 
over three bands, and is referred to as time-frequency interleaving (TFI); and the other type 
transmits the coded information in a single band, and is referred to as fixed frequency 
interleaving (FFI). As in Band Group 1, four TFCs using TFI and three TFCs using FFI are 
defined, providing support for up to seven channels. The TFCs used in Band Group 1 are 
shown in Table 1 [11].

TFC #6 2 2 2 2 2 2 
TFC #7 3 3 3 3 3 3

B. Channel Estimation 
The transmission of MB-OFDM is divided into two phases, the preamble phase and the 
data transmission phase. The preamble signal contains packet synchronization sequences, 
frame synchronization sequences and channel estimation sequences. For channel estimation, 
six channel estimation symbols are available, each of which contains some predefined 
sequences allocated in the frequency-domain. According to the TFCc defined in Table 1, there 
are two symbols available in each band for piconets adopting TFCs #1 - #4, and there are up 
to six symbols available for piconets adopting TFCs #5 - #7. Assume that the total number of 
sub-carriers in a transmission band is N , and that the preamble sequence of a OFDM symbol 
with a symbol duration T  is { }[ ], 0,1, , 1S k k N= −" . By IFFT (inverse fast Fourier 
transform), the sample values of the preamble symbol in the time-domain can be represented 
as

= × = −∑ " .                  (1) 
Before serially transmitting the time-domain samples, a cyclic prefix (CP) is generally added 
in front of an OFDM symbol to mitigate inter-symbol-interference (ISI) and to restore the 
orthogonality among different sub-carriers. However, for MB-OFDM systems, a zero padded 
suffix (ZPS) rather than a CP is appended at the rear of an OFDM symbol, which can also 
mitigate ISI. To restore the orthogonality among different subcarriers, the receiver will copy 
the received ZPS samples and then add it to the front of the OFDM symbol [13]. Adding a 
ZPS can achieve almost the same performance as adding a CP, but it slightly increases the 
received noise power. The length of the CP or ZPS is assumed to be N . 
 
The time-domain signal ( )s t  then passes through the propagation channel with an 
impulse response ( )h t . Since UWB channels vary very slowly and the symbol duration is 
very short, it is assumed that the two or six channel estimation symbols transmitted in the 
same band suffer almost the same channel-selectivity fading. At the receiving end, a received 
symbol in the time-domain can be represented in a vector form as  
= ⊗ + + = ⊗ +y s h w m s h v ,                        (2) 
where ⊗  denotes the circular convolution operator; s  is the signal vector, h  is the 
channel response vector, w  is the channel noise vector assumed to be additive white 
Gaussian noise (AWGN), and m  is the multi-access interference vector coming from other 
SOPs, all in the time-domain; and = +v w m . For the frequency equivalent description, we 
have the received column vector 
= × + + = × +Y S H W M S H V ,                       (3) 
where S  is a diagonal matrix with { [0], , [ 1]}S S N −"  on its diagonal; H  is the 
frequency-domain channel response vector; W  and M  are the noise vector and the 
interference vector, respectively, in the frequency-domain; and = +V W M . By using the 
least-square criterion and assuming, for the sake of simplicity, interference M  to be a zero 
mean Gaussian process, we have the least-square estimation for H  being [14], [15] 
1ˆ ( )LS H H−= ×H S S S Y ,                            (4) 
where HS  is the Hermitian matrix of S . Since S  is a diagonal matrix, we have the 
estimated channel gain of sub-carrier k  being [14] 
ˆ [ ] [ ] [ ]LSH k Y k S k= ,                            (5) 
where [ ]S k  and [ ]Y k  are the transmitted and received signals of sub-carrier k , 
respectively.

B. Time Redundancy with Linear Interpolation (TRLI) Estimation 
Based on the TR property we propose a channel estimation scheme – Time Redundancy 
with Linear Interpolation (TRLI) estimator to improve the channel estimation performance. In 
the transmitter, the preamble symbols use only all the even sub-carriers or all the odd 
sub-carriers in order to obtain the TR property. To simplify the explanation of our proposed 
schemes we assume that the preamble symbols use only all the even sub-carriers. For the case 
of using all the odd sub-carriers, similar results can be easily derived. In addition, the signal 
power on each even sub-carrier is doubled in order to maintain the same symbol energy. In the 
receiver, the channel gains can be estimated by using the LSE concept as shown in (5). Since 
there is no channel information available on the odd sub-carriers, linear interpolation in the 
frequency-domain is applied due to its simplicity, applicability and efficiency for a relatively 
flat fading channel. Subsequently, we have the channel gain estimation for conventional LSE 
being

C. TRLI with Adaptive Select and Replace (ASR) Scheme 
When the desired preamble symbol has collided with an interfering symbol, thanks to the 
TR property, the interference power can be reduced by selecting the un-interfered part to 
replace the full/part of the interfered samples, except when the preamble symbol is fully 
interfered. This interference elimination process is adapted to the arrival time of the 
interfering symbol, as shown in Fig. 2. Assuming that the timing information of the 
interference is available, the desired receiver can take the un-interfered time-domain samples 
to replace the redundant samples which have been interfered. In this way, all or part of the 
interference power can be eliminated. This timing information can be obtained by examining 
the statistic of the received signal; moreover, even when the timing information cannot be 
precisely obtained, the timing error will only slightly degrade the interference elimination 
performance. Case A shows that the desired symbol, excluding CP or ZPS, is overlapped by 
the interfering symbol in more than half of the symbol duration. As a result only part of the 
interference can be eliminated. On the other hand, in Case B the overlapping interval is 
smaller than half of the symbol duration, and thus the interference can be completely 
eliminated.

D. Time Redundancy with Even/Odd Sub-carriers (TREO) Estimation 
When we consider a highly frequency-selective fading channel, the correlation of the 
channel gains between adjacent sub-carriers is quite small, such as CM4 for UWB 
environments. In that case linear interpolation generally does not perform well, and severely 
degrades the estimation performance of each decimated sub-carrier. If there are two preamble 
symbols available for the same band, then we can have one symbol for the estimation of even 
sub-carriers and the other one for the estimation of odd sub-carriers, while still maintaining 
the TR property. This scheme, referred to as Time-domain Redundancy with Even/Odd 
sub-carriers (TREO) estimation, is very suitable for a highly frequency-selective fading 
channel, since no linear interpolation is required.  
 
2.3. Performance Analysis 
The criterion of performance evaluation is based on the normalized mean square error 
(NMSE) of channel gain estimation, defined as 1 12 2

H k H k H k− −= =−∑ ∑ . For the 
conventional LSE scheme, each sub-carrier transmits a pilot signal with the average received 
signal power on each sub-carrier assumed to be P , and the received channel noise power and 
the received interference power on each sub-carrier are assumed to be 2Wσ  and 2Mσ , 
respectively. We thus define the signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) as 2W WR P σ=  and the 
signal-to-interference power ratio (SIR) as 2M MR P σ= . In the desired receiver, assuming 
that the interval of the desired symbol, excluding CP or ZPS, overlapped by the interfering 
symbol is D  samples, we have the average total received noise plus interference power as 
2 2
W MN Dσ σ+ . After FFT in the receiver, the received signal-to-interference plus noise power 
ratio (SINR) on each sub-carrier equals ( )2 2W MP D Nσ σ+ . Consequently, the NMSE of 
conventional LSE on each sub-carrier is  
( ) ( ) ( )2 2 1LSE W M W MD D N P R D N Rε σ σ= + = + × .              (12) 
 
By using the sample time as the basic unit and taking the arrival time of the desired 
preamble symbol as the reference 0, the arrival time of the interfering symbol IT  must be 
within ( 1), 1N N N N − + − + −   , otherwise the desired symbol will not be interfered. First 
we examine the case using CP in preamble symbols. According to Fig. 2(a), the value of D ,

It must be noted that CP will be removed in the receiver and that the corruption in CP will not 
harm the desired signal. Hence, by taking the average over D , we have the average NMSE of

On the other hand, if ZPS is employed, the interference signal overlapping the ZPS 
interval of the preamble symbol will be copied and added to the front of the preamble symbol, 
 10
( )2 22 W MP D Nσ σ+ , and the NMSE of TRLI-EGC on each even sub-carrier is 
( ) ( )CP CPTRLI EGC TRLI LSED Dε ε− −= . Finally, we have the average NMSE of TRLI-EGC estimation 
the same as (19) and (20). 
 
C. One symbol: TRLI-ASR scheme 
Assuming that CP is employed and referring to Fig. 2(a), we divide the analysis into two 
cases:  
z Case A (with 2D N≥ ): only part of the interference can be eliminated and the 
received interference power is 2(2 ) MD N σ− . For the channel noise, the repeated noise 
power is ( ) 22 WN D σ−  and the non-repeated noise power is ( ) 22 WD N σ− . 
z Case B (with 2D N< ): all the interference can be eliminated. For the channel noise, 
the repeated noise power is 22 WDσ  and the non-repeated noise power is ( ) 22 WN D σ− .  
It must be noted that the received repeated noise power will fall on even sub-carriers only, 
while the non-repeated noise power will fall on all sub-carriers. Therefore, the average noise 
power on each even sub-carrier is ( ) 23 2 WD N σ−  and ( ) 21 2 WD N σ+  for Case A and Case 
B, respectively. In other words, the noise plus interference power on each even sub-carrier for 
Case A and Case B are ( )2 2 23 2 (2 1)V W MD N D Nσ σ σ= − + −  and ( )2 21 2V WD Nσ σ= + , 
respectively. Then the NMSE of TRLI-ASR on each of the even sub-carriers is

If ZPS is employed, then the channel noise will be enhanced due to the copying and 
adding process of ZPS. However, by applying ASR, the first N  samples may be replaced by 
other un-interfered samples. As a result, the amount of enhanced noise depends on the value 
of D . According to Fig. 2(b) and (13), the total amount of enhanced noise in the preamble 
symbol is assumed to be 2Wασ , where we have

F. Two symbols: TREO-ASR scheme 
Since there are two preamble symbols available for channel estimation, we can use these 
two symbols, each of which has the TR property and can apply ASR to eliminate the 
interfering signal, to individually estimate the even and odd sub-carriers without the need of 
linear interpolation. This scheme is referred to as the TREO-ASR scheme. We have the 
NMSE of the TREO-ASR scheme the same as that of the TRLI-ASR scheme with one symbol 
except for the interpolation error. In other words, for the case with CP, the NMSE is

It must be noted that the performance for other scenarios shown in Fig. 1 can be easily 
obtained by modifying the previously derived results. 
 
2.4. Performance Evaluation 
The system performance is evaluated via simulation with the channel model assumed to 
be CM1 or CM4 of the UWB systems. Numerical results are provided for comparison with 
the correlation coefficients ( )iρ  obtained from the corresponding UWB channel models. For 
CM1, the corresponding correlation coefficients are ( 2) 0.93 0.23iρ − = − , 
( 1) 0.98 0.12iρ − = − , (1) 0.98 0.12iρ = +  and (2) 0.93 0.23iρ = + ; while the correlation 
coefficients for CM4 are ( 2) 0.03 0.45iρ − = − − , ( 1) 0.42 0.64iρ − = − , (1) 0.42 0.64iρ = +  
and (2) 0.03 0.45iρ = − + . Furthermore, it is assumed that the number of sub-carriers is 
128N = , the length of CP or ZPS is 32 samples, and the number of preamble symbols used 
for channel estimation is one or two. Two interfering scenarios are investigated: one assumes 
that SIR is equal to 9 dB, corresponding to a mildly interfered case; and the other assumes 
SIR = -3 dB, corresponding to a severely interfered case. Four estimation schemes are 
investigated: conventional LSE, TRLI-LSE, TRLI-ASR, and TREO-ASR, where the 
TREO-ASR scheme only applies to the case with two preamble symbols. The performance of 
conventional LSE is regarded as a baseline performance.  
 
Fig. 3 shows the average NMSE of one preamble symbol versus SNR for an 
interference-free channel, where TRLI denotes the TRLI-LSE scheme. Because the power on 
each even sub-carrier of TRLI is doubled compared with the conventional LSE, the estimation 
performance on even sub-carriers of TRLI is far better than that of conventional LSE. 
However, interpolation errors on odd sub-carriers may deteriorate the overall average 
estimation performance of TRLI. Since the correlation between two adjacent sub-carriers is 
very high for CM1 and is very low for CM4, we have very small interpolation errors for CM1 
and large interpolation errors for CM4. Thus TRLI outperforms conventional LSE for CM1,

Fig. 5 shows the average NMSE of one preamble symbol with CP versus SNR for SIR = 
-3 dB, i.e. the interference power is two times the received signal power. It is found that the 
performance of conventional LSE is severely degraded by the interference. Although the 
performance of TRLI-LSE and TRLI-ASR is also degraded by the interference, it is still far 
better than that of conventional LSE both for CM1 and CM4. Compared to TRLI-LSE, 
TRLI-ASR is superior even for low SNR. This is mainly due to the fact that the interference 
can be efficiently eliminated by the ASR scheme. In addition, as shown in Fig. 2, the ASR 
scheme considers the interfering signal having a finite symbol duration T  and only 
eliminates the interference in a symbol duration. In other words, the delay spread of the 
interfering signal is not considered in the ASR scheme, and part of the interference cannot be 
eliminated in simulation. Thus we find that the simulation results of TRLI-ASR are slightly 
worse than the theoretical results, especially for CM4 which has a very large delay spread.

For UWB systems, there are two preamble symbols available for channel estimation. 
Thus EGC is applied to improve the estimation performance. Fig. 8 shows the average NMSE 
of two preamble symbols with ZPS versus SNR for SIR = 9 dB. Because the interpolation 
error is very large for CM4, the performance of TRLI-ASR with EGC is worse than that of 
conventional LSE with EGC for CM4. By using the TREO-ASR scheme, linear interpolation 
is not required and no interpolation error is introduced; hence, a performance better than that 
of conventional LSE with EGC is obtained both in CM1 and CM4. Nevertheless, the 
performance of TREO-ASR in CM1 is worse than that of TRLI-LSE and that of TRLI-ASR, 
since the interpolation error is very small in CM1.

3. Data-carrier Aided Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation for OFDM 
Systems 
 
Recently, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has attracted widespread 
attention for future wireless communications. The main idea of OFDM is to segment the 
available spectrum into numerous narrow-band subcarriers, which are orthogonal to each 
other. In order to prevent inter-carrier interference (ICI), maintaining orthogonality among all 
subcarriers is essential for OFDM systems. Both the frequency oscillator mismatch between 
the transmitter and the receiver and Doppler effects for mobile users will lead to the carrier 
frequency offset (CFO) problem, which destroys the orthogonality among all subcarriers in 
OFDM systems. The normalized CFO, defined as the carrier frequency offset divided by the 
subcarrier spacing, can be partitioned into the integral part and the fractional part. The integral 
CFO causes subcarrier cyclic shifting; while the fractional CFO results in not only ICI, but 
also the amplitude reduction and phase rotation of the desired signal, thus severely degrading 
the receiving performance. To maintain an acceptable performance, the receiver must estimate 
and compensate the receiving CFO. 
 
The integral CFO can be easily estimated and compensated by the receiver; hence, in this 
work, the performance of fractional CFO estimation is the major concern. Conventional 
fractional CFO estimation can be classified into two categories: the pilot tone-aided (PTA) 
schemes [19]-[23] and the cyclic prefix-based (CPB) schemes [24]-[27]. Furthermore, various 
blind CFO estimation schemes have been proposed and investigated [28]-[32]. Since those 
schemes are generally with much higher complexity and implementation cost, we focus only 
on the PTA and CPB schemes in this work. For the PTA-based schemes, known pilot symbols 
are transmitted periodically on some specific subcarriers. The CFO estimation is then 
obtained by comparing the phases corresponding to a specific pilot subcarrier in two received 
OFDM symbols. The CPB-based schemes employ the correlation between the cyclic prefix 
(CP) and the corresponding samples of the received signal in the time-domain to evaluate 
CFO. In addition to the subcarriers dedicated for channel/frequency estimation, data 
subcarriers are also candidates that may be potentially used to improve the CFO estimation. 
After data demodulation, if the data symbols have been correctly decoded, the phase errors on 
the data subcarriers may be used to improve the CFO estimation [33]-[34]. However, coarse 
demodulation on the data subcarriers is essential before CFO estimation, and an iterative 
process is necessary in order to obtain better performance; otherwise, this scheme can neither 
benefit the demodulation of current symbol nor resist a sudden change of CFO. 
 
To utilize the CFO information embedded in the data subcarriers, we propose novel 
data-subcarrier aided CFO estimation algorithms based on the PTA and CPB schemes, 
without the need of demodulating the data in advance, for M-PSK data modulated OFDM 
systems. The proposed algorithms can significantly improve the CFO estimation performance 
at the cost of an increase in computational complexity. In addition, the Cramer-Rao lower 
bound (CRLB) is generally used for analytical performance evaluation of estimation. The 
CRLB of the CPB scheme has been investigated in [26]. However, the CRLB of the PTA 
scheme has not been studied yet in literature. In this work, we also derive the approximated 
CRLB of the PTA-based schemes and the approximated lower bounds, based on the mean 
square error (MSE) sense, of the proposed schemes for performance evaluation.  
 
3.1. System and Channel Models 
In this section, we introduce the OFDM system model carrying a fractional CFO and the 
channel model employed for simulation.  
 20
3.2. Data-subcarrier Aided CFO Estimation  
In this section, we briefly introduce the conventional PTA and CPB estimation schemes, 
and then propose the data-subcarrier aided CFO estimation algorithms for M-PSK modulated 
OFDM systems. 
 
A. Conventional Pilot Tone - Aided CFO Estimation 
The PTA scheme is a frequency-domain CFO estimation algorithm utilizing the 
information on each pilot subcarrier. According to (37) and temporarily ignoring ICI, the 
phase shift due to CFO can be divided into two parts: the fixed phase shift term 
[ ]2 ( 1)f CPN N Nπδ + −  
and the linear incremental phase shift term 
[ ]2 ( )f CPm N N Nπ δ + . 
Since the phase shift is linear proportional to the symbol index m , the estimated CFO can be 
calculated by comparing the phases corresponding to a specific pilot subcarrier in two 
received OFDM symbols, for example symbol m and symbol ( )m ξ+ . Let there be PN  
pilot subcarriers in each OFDM symbol, and P  denote the set of indices corresponding to all 
pilot subcarriers. For pilot subcarrier n , if the channel response does not change quickly, i.e., 
[ ] [ ]m mH n H nξ+≈ , we have a decision variable corresponding to the phase difference between 
symbol m  and symbol ( )m ξ+  as ( ) ( )1[ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]P m m m mV n Y n C n Y n C nξ ξ+ += , where 
[ ]mC n  and [ ]mC nξ+  are the pilot signals transmitted in symbol m  and symbol ( )m ξ+ , 
respectively. It must be noted that the influence of the data modulation phase and the effect of 
the channel response have been removed. Finally, by averaging the phase rotation on all pilot 
subcarriers, we have the CFO estimation of the PTA scheme as

where { }Angle •  denotes the operation taking the phase angle in radian. 
 
Since the channel gains are distinct on different subcarriers, the received signal on a pilot 
subcarrier with a small channel gain may be severely disturbed by AWGN and ICI, and 
provides an inaccurate CFO estimation result. Hence, equally averaging the phase rotations on 
all pilot subcarriers, as shown in (40), is not the best strategy. To further improve the 
estimation performance, the PTA with weighing (PTAW) scheme is proposed by assigning 
different weights based on the received signal power on each pilot subcarrier. The CFO 
estimation of the PTAW scheme is represented as [19]

B. Conventional Cyclic Prefix – Based CFO Estimation 
The CPB scheme is carried out in the time-domain instead of in the frequency-domain. 
According to (35), the phase shift due to the CFO depends on the time index k , and the 
phase difference between two samples 1( )my k  and 2( )my k  in a OFDM symbol is 
2 12 ( )f k k Nπδ − . With the repeat property of the CP, the CFO estimation of the CPB scheme 
can be represented as [24]

{ }[ , ] Angle [ , ] , for 1, , ,Di n V i n i M nΨ = = ∈D" .                (46) 
Step 4: Compared to refΨ , the presumed decision variable on data subcarrier n  is 
determined as the one with a phase closest to refΨ , i.e.,  ( )1, ,ˆ [ ] arg min [ , ] , ,D D refi MiV n V i n n n= = Ψ −Ψ ∈   D" .                (47)

D. Modified Cyclic Prefix – Based CFO Estimation 
The second proposed scheme is referred to as the modified CPB (MCPB) scheme since 
the reference CFO is obtained by using the CPB method. Due to the influence of AWGN, the 
number of samples that are taken for CFO estimation is crucial for estimation accuracy. In the 
conventional CPB scheme, there are only 1CPN L− +  samples, which do not suffer from ISI, 
used for CFO estimation. However, when L  is too large, there will be only limited number 
of samples available for CFO estimation; thus the estimation performance is severely 
degraded. In the proposed MCPB scheme, the signals of data subcarriers in the 
frequency-domain are used to improve the estimation performance. The concept of this 
scheme is similar to that of the proposed MPTA scheme except that the initial reference CFO 
is obtained by using the CPB scheme. Details of the MCPB scheme are shown as follows.  
Step 1: According to (42), the reference CFO ,ˆf CPBδ  is obtained by using the CPB scheme. 
Moreover, the equivalent frequency-domain reference phase corresponding to ,ˆf CPBδ  is 
determined as

B. Performance of the MPTA Scheme 
To evaluate the performance of the MPTA scheme, we proposed an approximated result 
based on the CRLB of the PTA-based schemes. According to (43), the received signals in the 
two OFDM symbols are first correlated and the resultant outcome is used as a decision

The first term is the desired decision variable for CFO estimation on data subcarrier n . The 
disturbing variable nζ  could induce a wrong determination of the desired decision variable, 
and is approximated as a zero mean Gaussian RV with a variance  ( )2 2 2 22 .n nEζ α η ησ ζ ζ σ σ σ κ∗ = = +                        (57) 
Taking the phase of nϕΩ  as a reference, the disturbing variable can be represented as 
, ,n n I n Qζ ζ ζ= + , where ,n Iζ  and ,n Qζ  are the in-phase component and the quadrature 
component of nζ , respectively. The phase drift of the decision variable nΓ  is mainly due to 
the quadrature component ,n Qζ , which has the average power 2 2, 2 2Qζ ζσ σ κ= = . Assuming 
that the average power of ,n Qζ  is small enough, i.e. 2 4,Qζ ασ σ , the phase of nΓ  can be 
approximated as 
{ } 1 4 4, ,=Angle tan ( )n n n Q n Qα αθ ζ σ ζ σ−Γ ≈ ≈ .                  (58) 
 
For M-PSK modulation, the M  possible data modulation phase differences between 
the two desired symbols are 2 , 0, , 1i M i Mπ = −" . Since the data modulation phase 
difference will be estimated and removed, the presumed phase nˆθ  of nΓ  will be determined 
as the one closest to refΨ  and is always limited within ( ),ref refM Mπ πΨ − Ψ + , where 
refΨ  is the reference phase corresponding to the reference CFO obtained in Step 1. As shown 
in Fig. 10, we conceptually show the distribution of the phase nθ  of nΓ . Define the actual 
data modulation phase difference on data subcarrier n  as Θ ; then we have the mean of nθ , 
consisting of Θ  and the phase shift due to CFO, being

where 2 ( )f CPN N Nπξδ∆Φ = + . Assuming that the reference phase refΨ  provides an 
acceptable accuracy, ref ref′Ψ = Ψ +Θ  will be close to nθµ . If the outcome of nθ  is within 
the interval ( )ref n refM Mπ θ π′ ′Ψ − ≤ ≤ Ψ + , such as ,1nθ  shown in Fig. 10, the presumed 
phase nˆθ , after removing the presumed data modulation phase difference, will be determined 
as nˆ nθ θ= −Θ  since it is closest to refΨ  for all possible data modulation phase differences.

achieved by applying the proposed MPTA scheme, for example at 15 dBγ = , is about 15 dB 
for BPSK data modulation, 10 dB for QPSK data modulation, and 3 dB for 8-PSK data 
modulation. Specifically for BPSK data modulation, the gain is about the ratio of the numbers 
of available subcarriers for estimation, i.e. ( ) 15 dBP D PN N N+ ≈ , since the data modulation 
phase ambiguity has a negligible effect on the CFO estimation.

Number of data subcarriers used for CFO estimation  
Fig. 16  MSE performance of the MPCB scheme versus the number of data subcarriers used 
for CFO estimation with 0.05fδ =  and 15 dBγ =  under ITU-5 channel model. 
 
Finally, we focus on the impact of applying different channel models on the CFO 
estimation performance. Fig. 17 shows the performance of the four schemes with 0.05fδ =  
and QPSK data modulation scheme under ITU-5 and ITU-6 models. For ITU-5 model, the 
last 50 uncorrupted samples of CP are used for CPB estimation; while, for ITU-6 model, the 
whole 64 samples of CP are used for CPB estimation, since the channel delay spread is larger 
than CP length. When ITU-5 model is applied, the CPB-based schemes outperform the 
PTA-based schemes, because that there is no ISI introduced into the CPB estimation. On the 
other hand, when ITU-6 model is applied, the performance of the CPB-based schemes is 
severely degraded by ISI since it is very sensitive to ISI. Although ISI also introduces ICI that 
will degrade the performance of the PTA-based schemes, the degradation is not very severe. 
Thus the PTA-based schemes become to outperform the CPB-based schemes. This implies 
that the PTA-based schemes are more robust for the propagation channel with a large delay 
spread.

In the channel estimation issue, we have proposed TRLI-LSE, TRLI-ASR and 
TREO-ASR schemes for the channel estimation of OFDM systems. Theoretical analyses were 
provided to evaluate their estimation performance. Based on the UWB-CM1 and UWB-CM4 
channel models, numerical and simulation results were investigated for performance 
evaluation. By applying the proposed methods, the estimation performance can be 
significantly improved when there is a strong interference. Even when there is no interference, 
the proposed methods can still improve the estimation performance in a low 
frequency-selective channel such as CM1. According to the performance evaluation shown in 
the previous section, we conclude the applicability of these schemes as follows. If only one 
preamble symbol is available, TRLI-ASR is the best choice for the case with a low SIR, both 
in a low frequency-selective channel (i.e., the correlation coefficient is large for adjacent 
sub-carriers, such as CM1) and in a highly frequency-selective channel (i.e., the correlation 
coefficient is very small for adjacent sub-carriers, such as CM4); however, if the received SIR 
is large enough, then TRLI-LSE should be applied in a low frequency-selective channel, and 
conventional LSE should be applied in a highly frequency-selective channel. On the other 
hand, if two preamble symbols are available, TRLI-ASR and TRLI-LSE with equal gain 
combining the two symbols are the best choice for low SNR and high SNR, respectively, in a 
low frequency-selective channel; whereas, in a highly frequency-selective channel, 
TERO-ASR will be the best choice.  
 
As mentioned above, whether to activate the ASR scheme depends on whether or not 
there is interference. In general, the receiver may report the interfering status to the transmitter. 
Even when the transmitter is not aware of the interfering status in the receiver, the transmitter 
can always apply the TRLI concept to generate the preamble symbols for a low 
frequency-selective channel, regardless whether or not there is interference in the receiving 
end. At the receiving end, the receiver can decide whether to activate the ASR scheme 
depending on the interference strength or received SIR. In other words, ASR is activated to 
apply TRLI-ASR estimation in case of strong interference, and ASR is not activated to apply 
TRLI-LSE when there is no interference. For a highly frequency-selective channel with only 
one preamble symbol available, the interfering status is the important information for making 
the decision as to which estimation method to use for achieving the best possible 
performance.   
 
 In the CFO estimation issue, we have proposed two modified algorithms for CFO 
estimation based on the conventional PTA and CPB methods. The key idea of our algorithms 
is exploitation of the CFO information embedded in data subcarriers for CFO estimation 
without the necessity of decoding data first. We also provide the CRLB of the PTA-based 
schemes and the MSE performance bounds of the MPTA and MCPB schemes for 
performance evaluation. Compared to the conventional schemes, we conclude that the 
proposed schemes, including the MPTA and MCPB schemes, can significantly improve the 
estimation performance at the cost of an increase in computational complexity. Moreover, we 
should employ different CFO estimation schemes under different propagation environments. 
If the multipath delay spread is much smaller than the CP length, the MCPB scheme will be 
the best choice because it can provide excellent MSE performance with its robustness to ICI 
and modulation size M. On the other hand, when there is a strong ISI with a delay spread 
exceeding the CP length, we should utilize the MPTA scheme since it is more tolerant to ISI.
