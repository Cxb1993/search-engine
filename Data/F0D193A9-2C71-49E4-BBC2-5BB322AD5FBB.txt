ABSTRACT 
We prepared four vinyl copolymers P1, P2, P5, and P6 containing pendant distyrylbenzene 
and aromatic 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives, respectively, from their precursor 
poly(styrene-ran-4-vinylbenzyl chloride) (Mw = 11400, PDI = 1.18), which had been 
prepared by the controlled radical polymerization (RAFT). Two main chain polymers 
containing similar isolated distyrylbenzene (P3) and aromatic 1,3,4-oxadiazole (P4) 
chromophores were also synthesized for comparative study. The resulted copolymers (P1~P6) 
are soluble in common organic solvents and are basically amorphous materials with 5% 
weight-loss temperature higher than 360°C. Compound 15 displays three kinds of smectic (S) 
phases with the mesophasic temperature range (SC2 60 SC1 105 SA 122 I) in the observation 
with a polarizing optical microscopy. The PL spectral results reveal that the architecture of 
P1 prevents the formation of inter- or intra-molecular interaction. The PL spectra results 
revealed that the architecture of P5 and P6 reduce the formation of aggregation. The HOMO 
and LUMO levels of P2, estimated from cyclic voltammetric data, are -5.96 eV and -3.81 eV, 
respectively, which are much lower than those of P1 (-5.12 eV and -3.11 eV). The emission 
of blend from P1 and P2 are contributed mainly from distyrylbenzene fluorophore (ca. 450 
nm) owing to efficient energy transfer. Moreover, the blend exhibits three kinds of redox 
behavior depending on their weight ratios. The LUMO levels of P5 and P6, estimated from 
cyclic voltammetric data, are higher than that of P2. The HOMO level of P6 is higher than 
that of P2 and P5. Both HOMO and LUMO levels of P2, P5, and P6 are much lower than 
MEH-PPV owing to electron-withdrawing characteristics of aromatic 1,3,4-oxadiazole 
groups. Through the blends of MEH-PPV/P2 and MEH-PPV/P5, improved device 
performance was achieved owing to electron-withdrawing aromatic 1,3,4-oxadiazole pendant 
groups.

INTRODUCTION 
Electroluminescence (EL) from small organic molecules1 and polymers2 forms the basis for 
their use in light-emitting diodes (LEDs). EL in such systems is generated by recombination 
of holes and electrons in the emitting layer, which produces excited states (excitons) in the 
emitter material. Polymer materials have the advantages of good processability, simple 
fabrication by solution processes, and good thermal stability. Many conjugated polymers, 
such as poly(p-phenylene vinylene)2 and ploythiophene,3 have been used as emitting 
materials in LED. However, fully conjugated polymers may have chromophores with 
different energy gaps because the effective length of conjugation is statistically distributed. 
The confinement of the conjugation into a well-defined length of the chain is one of the most 
successful strategies developed so far. In addition, the conjugated backbone presents 
problems for synthesis and processing because it tends to render the polymer very rigid and 
insoluble. Polymers carrying isolated luminescent functional groups in their side chains show 
controlling the conjugation length, good solubility in common organic solvents, and a variety 
of possible pendant groups.4-7  
  Among the various techniques to polymerize vinyl monomers, ranging from ionic to group 
transfer, the most convenient remains free radical polymerization. However, traditional free 
radical procedures have a significant drawback, which is related to the reactivity of the 
propagating free radical chain end and its propensity to undergo a variety of different 
termination and transfer reactions. The polymers obtained are therefore polydisperse with 
very limited control over molecular weight distribution and architecture.8 In the past decade 
there have been many efforts toward the development of controlled/“living” free radical 
polymerization processes. Three successful and commonly used approaches have been 
developed, namely nitroxide-mediated free radical polymerization (NMRP),9-10 atom transfer 
radical polymerization (ATRP),11-12 and reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer 
 3
been synthesized and characterized for the comparative study of the difference between this 
two type isolated copolymers. The optical and electrochemical properties of these 
copolymers have been investigated in detail. Alam et al. report that efficient 
electroluminescence can be achieved in binary blends of conjugated polymers (MEH-PPV + 
polyquinoline). Large enhancements in performance of the binary blend light-emitting diodes 
were observed compared to that of the homopolymer diodes.22 Finally, the 
electroluminescent properties of blends from P2 and well known light-emitting material 
MEH-PPV were investigated to evaluate the ability of P2 in enhancing electron-transport. In 
order to obtain electron-transport/injection polymers of narrow molecular weight distribution 
with uniform film-forming properties, vinyl copolymers (P5, P6) with aromatic 
1,3,4-oxadiazole chromophores were synthesized by the procedure of RAFT process. The 
thermal, optical, and electrochemical properties of these copolymers have been investigated 
in detail. The electroluminescent properties of blends from P5-P6 and well known 
light-emitting material MEH-PPV were investigated to evaluate the ability of P5-P6 in 
enhancing electron-transport. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
Materials and Characterization 
The synthetic procedures of compound 1 (Scheme 2) and copolymer P4 (Scheme 4) are 
described in the literatures elsewhere.30-31 Styrene and 4-vinylbenzyl chloride were distilled 
under reduced pressure to remove inhibitor before use. 4,4’-azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN) 
was purified by recrystallizing twice from ethanol and dried at room temperature under 
vacuum. The RAFT agent, 2-phenylprop-2-yl dithiobenzoate, was synthesized according to 
literature procedure.34 Other reagents were of commercial sources and used without further 
purification. The solvents were dried by the conventional procedures. All new compounds 
were identified by 1H NMR, FT-IR, and elemental analysis (EA). The 1H NMR spectra were

The EL device configuration was ITO/ PEDOT:PSS/MEH-PPV+P2, P5, P6/Al. The 
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT:PSS) was first coated onto ITO glass as the 
hole-injection layer, followed with spin coating of the emissive layer onto the PEDOT-coated 
ITO from a solution of the polymer blend. Finally, the aluminum was deposited onto the 
polymer film via vacuum evaporation under 10-5 torr. All the devices were fabricated and 
tested under ambient conditions with no protective encapsulation. The film thickness of 
emissive layers were about 70-95 nm as measured by the AFM. Device luminance, EL 
spectra and current-voltage characteristics were recorded in air using a combination of 
Keithley power supply (model 2400) and Ocean Optics usb2000 fluorescence 
spectrophotometer. 
Synthesis of Precursor Copolymer PSV (Scheme 1) 
The copolymer poly(styrene-ran-4-vinylbenzenzyl chloride) was synthesized by a general 
procedure of RAFT process. Bulk random copolymerization of styrene and 4-vinylbenzyl 
chloride was performed using AIBN as initiator. A mixture of styrene (3.234 g, 31 mmol), 
4-vinylbenzyl chloride (1.572g, 10 mmol), AIBN (0.0017 M), and 2-phenylprop-2-yl 
dithiobenzoate (0.0084 M) was added to a 5-mL polymerization tube fitted with a magnetic 
stirring bar. The mixture was degassed by four freeze-evacuate-thaw cycles and the tube was 
sealed under vacuum. The mixture was allowed to react at 60°C for 20 h. After precipitation 
from methanol, the appearing precipitates were collected by centrifugal sedimentation and 
then purified by extracting with methanol for 24 h using a Soxhlet extractor. The conversion 
was 26%. PSV: 1H NMR (CDCl3, ppm): δ 7.15-6.20 (m, Ar H and Vinyl H), 4.52 (m,

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Synthesis and Characterization 
The precursor copolymer PSV was prepared by the RAFT polymerization of styrene and 
4-vinylbenzyl chloride using AIBN as initiator and 2-phenylprop-2-yl dithiobenzoate as 
chain-transfer agent. The RAFT controlled/“living” free radical polymerization controls 
chain growth through reversible chain transfer.36 The composition of PSV has been 
confirmed by the 1H NMR spectra as shown in Figure 2-(a). The weight-average molecular 
weights (Mw) of PSV, determined by gel permeation chromatography using monodisperse 
 15
respectively. On the other hand, P3 was obtained by direct polycondensation of bisphenol 1 
and xylylene bromide 8 (Scheme 4). 1H NMR spectra of the precursor copolymer PSV and 
copolymers P1, P2 are shown in Figure 2. The chemical shift at 4.51 ppm attributed to the 
benzyl (-CH2-) protons (b) in PSV shifts completely to 4.91 ppm in P1 and P2, indicating 
complete replacement of Cl in the precursor. The Williamson condensation was employed to 
the synthesis of copolymers P5-P6 which were obtained by condensation of pendant benzyl 
chloride of PSV with reactive phenol groups of aromatic 1,3,4-oxadiazole fluorophores. 1H 
NMR spectra of the precursor copolymer PSV and copolymers P5, P6 are shown in Figure 3. 
The chemical shift at 4.51 ppm attributed to the benzyl (-CH2-) protons (b) in PSV shifts 
completely to 4.91 ppm in P5 and P6, indicating complete replacement of Cl in the precursor. 
The P1-P6 are soluble in common organic solvents such as toluene, chloroform, THF, and 
1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane. The weight-average molecular weights (Mw) of P1-P3, and P5-P6, 
determined by GPC using polystyrene as standard, were 6.18×104, 1.97×104, 8.49 ×104, 
3.23×104, and 6.32×104, respectively (Table 1). The polydispersity index increases slightly 
from 1.18 (PSV) to 1.27~1.34 (P1, P2, P5, P6) after attaching the fluorophores as a result of 
steric effect. All copolymers exhibited moderate thermal stability with thermal decomposition 
temperatures (at 5% weight loss) above 360°C in N2 atmosphere. Clearly, P1, P2, P5, and P6 
follow a two-step thermal degradation procedure, in which the first step decomposition 
behavior is similar to that of PSV. This suggests that thermal decomposition of these 
copolymers starts from main chain. On DSC thermogram, PSV shows a glass transition 
temperature (Tg) at 89°C. P2 containing aromatic 1,3,4-oxadiazole side groups shows a Tg at 
116°C. However, for P1 and P4 no noticeable glass transitions are observed, and therefore 
the two polymers are most likely amorphous materials. The high Tg values of present EL 
polymers are expected to prevent morphology deformation and degradation when used as 
emitting or electron-transport layers in PLEDs. Polymer P5 and P6 show the glass transition 
 17
emission maxima appear at 450, 358, 450, and 452 nm, respectively. In film state the 
absorption peaks locate at 395, 300, 406, and 402 (328) nm, wit the emission maxima appear 
at 452, 372, 456, and 463 nm, respectively. Except for P2, little absorption shifts are 
observed in going from solution to film state. The greater absorption red-shift (25 nm) of P2 
is probably owing to intra- or inter-chain stacking of 1,3,4-oxadiazole segments (aggregation). 
However, P1 film shows only slight red-shift (2 nm), which is attributable to the steric 
hindrance of the hexyloxy and dodecyloxy substituents in distyrylbenzene chromophores that 
prevent formation of inter- or intra-molecular interaction. The PL spectrum of P2 film 
red-shifts only 14 nm compared with that in solution. Clearly, in P1 and P2 films, the degree 
of inter- or intra-molecular interaction is mainly determined by the side-chain structures. 
Copolymers P1 and P3 are consisting of the same isolated emitting distyrylbenzene 
chromophores which are incorporated into pendant and main chains, respectively. P1 exhibits 
similar PL spectra regardless of in solution and in film state. But the PL spectrum of P3 in 
film shows 6 nm red-shifts as compared with those in solution as a result of molecular 
stacking. This suggests that the architecture of P1 is unfavorable for molecular stacking. In 
film state the PL peak of P4 red-shifts 11 nm relative to in solution and is characteristically 
broader with slightly changed absorption maximum, suggesting the formation of excimer or 
exciplex which provides non-radiation decay channels for the excited states.41-43 As shown in 
Table 2, the relative quantum yield (ΦPL) of P1 (ΦPL = 0.25) is much lower than P3 and P4 
(ΦPL = 0.54, 0.53), which can be attributed to less molar content of the emitting 
distyrylbenzene derivatives in P1 (0.31) than P3 (0.5) and P4 (0.5). 
It is known that the energy transfer readily occurs when the PL spectrum of the donor 
overlaps with the absorption spectrum of the acceptor.44 As shown in Figure 7, the emission 
spectrum of P2 (peak at 358 nm) overlaps well with the absorption spectrum of P1, 
suggesting that excitation energy might transfer from P2 (energy donor) to P1 (energy 
 19
wavelength. This suggests that the aggregation still exist in P5 and P6 films. The PL spectra 
of P2 and P5 films red-shift only 14 nm compared with that in solution as a result of the 
aggregation. However, in film state the PL peak of P6 red-shifts 29 nm relative to in solution 
and is characteristically broader with slightly changed absorption maximum, suggesting the 
formation of excimer or exciplex which provides non-radiation decay channels for the 
excited states.42-44                                                                        
Electrochemical Properties 
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is an effective tool in studying the reduction-oxidation behaviors of 
polymer thin films. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymer films can be 
estimated using the equations EHOMO = -(Eox + 4.8) eV and ELUMO = -(Ered + 4.8) eV, 
respectively, where Eox and Ered are the onset potentials for oxidation and reduction relative 
to the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple. Table 3 summarizes the electrochemical properties of 
P1-P4 and P1/P2 blends at different weight ratios, and their energy band diagrams are 
proposed as shown in Figure 10. The electrochemical band gap values differ from the optical 
band gaps and thus indicated that EL and PL originated from different excited state. 
Especially P4 with isolated alternate hole- and electron-transporting segments, the oxidation 
and reduction start at the former and the latter segments. However, the optical band gap in P4 
originates from the lower energy segment (hole-transporting segment). Figure 11 shows the 
cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of blend film of P1 and P2 coated on ITO glass. Both HOMO 
and LUMO levels of P2 (-5.96 eV, -3.81 eV) are much lower than P1 (-5.12 eV, -3.11 eV) 
owing to electron-withdrawing characteristics of aromatic 1,3,4-oxadiazole groups in P2. In 
previous studies on copoly(aryl ether)s consisting of isolated hole- and electron-transporting 
segments, we found that oxidation started at hole-transporting distyrylbenzene segments 
although they possessed different electron-transporting segments.27 Further, the molecular 
orbital (LUMO and HOMO) for optimized structures of repeat units in P1/P2 blend via 
 21
(CVs) of P2, P5, and P6 films coated on ITO glass. The LUMO levels of P2, P5, and P6 are 
-3.81 eV, -3.10 eV, and -3.09 eV, respectively. The LUMO level of P5 (-3.10 eV) containing 
additional dodecyloxy substituents in aromatic 1,3,4-oxadiazole chromophores is higher than 
that of P2 (-3.81 eV) as a result of the orbital overlap of the lone pair on oxygen. P6 
containing extended phenylene moiety connected aromatic 1,3,4-oxadiazole chromophores 
shows higher LUMO level compared to P2. It suggests that incorporate the phenylene moiety 
to 1,3,4-oxadiazole chromophores reduce the electron affinity of polymer. The HOMO levels 
of P2, P5, and P6 are -5.96 eV, -5.77 eV, and -5.37 eV, respectively. P6 shows higher HOMO 
level compared to P2 and P5. It’s probably due to the different position of hole injection. 
Further, the molecular orbital (HOMO) for optimized structures of repeat units in P5 and P6 
via MNDO semi-empirical calculation are depicted in Figure 16.45 It suggests that the 
oxidation start near the phenylene segments. In general, lowering in LUMO energy level 
leads to enhanced electron affinity, which will reduce electron-injection barrier. Both HOMO 
and LUMO levels of P2, P5, and P6 are much lower than MEH-PPV (-5.02 eV, -2.7 eV) 
owing to electron-withdrawing characteristics of aromatic 1,3,4-oxadiazole groups. 
Electroluminescent Properties 
Double-layer light-emitting devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MEHPPV+P2/Al) have been 
fabricated to investigate the possibility of P2 in improving EL performance of MEH-PPV. 
Figure 17 illustrates the current density and luminance versus bias characteristic of 
MEHPPV/P2 blend at different weight ratio. The turn-on voltages of the devices, which is 
defined arbitrarily as the voltage required for the luminance of 1 cd/m2, are about 4, 4, 4, 3, 
and 4 V, respectively, at the weight ratios of MEH-PPV/P2 = 100/0, 95/5, 90/10, 80/20, and 
50/50. The maximal current efficiencies of the devices increase steadily from 0.11 to 0.44 
cd/A as the weight ratios of P2 increases from 0 to 20%. The maximal current efficiency of 
MEH-PPV/P2 (80/20) was 4 times of MEH-PPV. This enhanced performance is attributed 
 23
95/5, 90/10, 80/20, and 50/50. The maximal current efficiencies of the devices increase 
steadily from 1.45 to 4.79 cd/A as the weight ratios of P2 increases from 0 to 50%. The 
maximal current efficiency of MEH-PPV/P2 (50/50) was 3.3 times of MEH-PPV. This 
enhanced performance is attributed to easier electron injection and enhanced electron 
transport, which is mainly contributed by electron-withdrawing aromatic 1,3,4-oxadiazole 
pendant groups in P5. The maximal luminance increases from 5860 cd/m2 (100/0) to 16261 
cd/m2 (50/50). Clearly, the blend system (MEH-PPV/P5) enhances the electron affinity, 
which facilitates the improvement of device performance. Double-layer light-emitting 
devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MEHPPV+ P6/Al) have been fabricated to investigate the 
possibility of P6 in order to improving EL performance of MEH-PPV. Figure 20 illustrates 
the current density and luminance versus bias characteristic of MEHPPV/P6 blend at 
different weight ratio. The turn-on voltages of the devices, which is defined arbitrarily as the 
voltage required for the luminance of 1 cd/m2, are about 2.5, 3.7, 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7 V, 
respectively, at the weight ratios of MEH-PPV/P6 = 100/0, 95/5, 90/10, 80/20, and 50/50. 
The maximal luminance increases from 5860 cd/m2 (100/0) to 7232 cd/m2 (95/5) and drops 
abruptly to 3570 cd/m2 (50/50). Figure 21 shows the photograph of EL emission from the 
polymer blend MEH-PPV/P6 = 80/20 for the device of ITO/PEDOT/MEHPPV+P6/Al. 
This decreased performance is attributed to micro-phase separation during film casting 
process. Figure 22 shows the SEM micrograph of the blend film with MEH-PPV/P6 = 50/50. 
It reveals clear micro-phase separation with submicron domains (~250 nm). 
CONCLUSIONS 
We have successfully synthesized and characterized six copolymers (P1-P6) containing 
isolated electron-transporting aromatic 1,3,4-oxadiazole or emitting 1,4-distyrylbenzene 
derivatives in side-chain or in main-chain. The precursor copolymer PSV with narrow 
polydispersity (PDI = 1.18) has been prepared by RAFT polymerization. The resulting
