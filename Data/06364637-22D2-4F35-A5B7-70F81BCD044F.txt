ABSTRACT 
The beneficial effects of cycling exercise via 
electrical stimulation (ES) have been 
demonstrated to improve human motion of 
populations with muscle disabilities, such as 
post-stroke, and incomplete spinal cord injury. 
During ES-assisted cycling, muscle contraction 
is generated from two different excitation 
sources, volitional contraction and external ES, 
which is referred as hybrid muscle activation. In 
the first-year study, we have developed an EMG 
recording system, which includes the stimulus 
artifact suppressor and software and hardware 
implementation for extracting volitional and ES-
induced EMG signals in dynamic movement 
during functional electrical therapy. The study 
aim of the second year is to clinically observe 
the brain reorganization from motor recovery 
via ES-assisted cycling has been seldom studied 
using traditional neuroimaging techniques due 
to the motion constraints. In this study, we 
investigated the regional cortical activities of 
bilateral sensorimotor cortices (SMC), 
supplementary motor areas (SMA) and 
premotor cortices (PMC) measured by 
functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) 
under varied forms of ES-induced cycling 
conditions. Software and hardware 
implementation for extracting volitional and ES-
induced EMG signals during cycling were used 
to assess the voluntary and ES-induced 
contraction. The brain-based rehabilitation 
scheme using NIRS should provide general 
guideline for design patient-tailored therapeutic 
scheme for stroke patients.

1.  Introduction 
Stroke is one of the leading causes of 
disability in United States and other developed 
countries. Those survived from stroke may be 
left with physical impairments deeply affecting 
the activities of daily living and quality of life 
[2]. The postural imbalance or asymmetric limb 
movements between the affected and unaffected 
 4
system which is virtually silent and less affected 
by subtle movement. These features are 
particularly applicable for the neuro-
rehabilitation study of motor performance.  
After reconstruction of hardware and 
software extraction of stimulus EMG and raw 
EMG from HMA, the aim of this study is to 
clinically evaluate the motor activation during 
ES-assisted cycling by using near infrared 
spectroscopy (NIRS). Software and hardware 
implementation for extracting volitional and ES-
induced EMG signals during cycling were used 
to assess the voluntary and ES-induced 
contraction. NIRS was used to record the 
hemodynamic changes in cortical activation 
under varied forms of ES-induced cycling 
conditions. 
 
2.  Materials and Methods 
 
A hybrid activation EMG processing and 
evaluation system was developed in this study. 
The system consists of five main parts, 
including constant-current stimulator, EMG 
recording sub-system with stimulus artifact 
suppressor, FPGA-based digital signal 
processing (DSP) unit, PC and ergometer 
(MOTOmed viva 2, RECK-Technik, Germany). 
First, surface stimulation was delivered to the 
muscles by constant-current stimulator. The 
EMG recording sub-system measured overall 
EMG including both volitional EMG and ES-
induced EMG. Then, FPGA-based DSP unit 
extracted the volitional EMG from overall EMG. 
PC communicated with the stimulator and 
cycling ergometer. Besides, the real-time 
cycling information, cycling speed, angle and 
torque value were transmitted from ergometer to 
PC for generating stimulation patterns and 
storing for further processing. At the same time, 
NIRS recoded cortical activation. Figure 1 
depicts block diagram of the recording brain 
function and ES-induced cycling system.

activation system. 
 
2.1 Instrumentation 
2.1.1 EMG recording sub-system with stimulus 
artifact suppressor 
Figure 2 shows the schematic diagram of 
the stimulus artifact suppressor with the EMG 
amplifier. The first monostable multivibrator 
was triggered by stimulus to generate 10 msec 
delay pulse because the repolarization artifact 
was found to be approximately 10 msec after the 
onset of stimulation. The first monostable 
multivibrator triggered a second monostable 
multivbrator to generate the measuring window 
pulse to control the COMS switches, ADG212 
(Analog Devices). The second monostable 
multivibrator was set to 39 msec measuring 
window time. The inverter, HD74LS04, was 
introduced between the monostable 
multivibrator and the COMS switches to ensure 
the input of EMG amplifier to be grounded 
during close window time. The monostable 
multivibrator, HD74LS123, allows the 
adjustment of the delay and measuring window 
time by variable resistors (Figure 2b).  
EMG electrodes connected to inputs of 
switches through lowpass filers with cutoff 
frequency of 5 Hz to eliminate the influence of 
motion artifact. The EMG amplifier began with 
the instrumentation amplifier, INA128 (BURR-
BROWN), at a gain of 100 VV-1. The output of 
the pre-amplifier signal was passed through the 
second stage amplifier at the gain of 2 VV-1. 
The last part of artifact suppression consisted of 
a sample-and-hold amplifier, LF398N (National 
Semiconductor), to hold the output for a period

vertex (Cz). The location of each channel was 
defined as the midpoint of the corresponding 
source-detector pair. The Brodmann’s area (BA) 
and the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) 
of each channel were estimated using the 
MRIcro software (http://www.MRIcro.com) 
[23]. Based on the anatomical structure and BA 
estimated for each channel, Fig. 4(c) depicts the 
mapping of optode channels for sensorimotor 
cortices (SMC) (left: channels 6-10; right: 
channels 16-20), supplementary motor area 
(SMA) (channels 4 and 5 in the left hemisphere 
and channels 12 and 13 in the right hemisphere); 
primary motor cortex (PMC) (left: channels 1, 2 
and 3, right: channels 11, 14 and 15), 
respectively. The concentration HbO changes of 
all channels within one area were averaged to 
represent the regional activation changes.

locations. (a) The optical fibers were placed on

2.1.3 Signal processing for separating volitional 
EMG and stimulus EMG 
 Figure 5 describes an EMG signal 
processing algorithm to extract the linear 
envelope of volitional EMG and to acquire PTP 
values of stimulus EMG from the overall EMG. 
The technique adopted for separating the 
volitional and the stimulus components was 
based on the comb filtering [22]. 
The overall EMG was filtered by band-
reject comb filter [12] to obtain volitional EMG. 
The edge effect of volitional EMG was further 
removed by software blocking. The stimulus 
EMG can be obtained by subtracting the 
volitional EMG from raw EMG.

2.2 Experimental design 
2.2.1 Task protocol 
The ergometer (MOTOmed viva 2, RECK-
Technik GmbH & Co. KG, Betzenweiler, 
Germany) was used for evaluating the cortical 
activation and kinesiological performance of 
cycling (Fig. 6a). The positions of legs related to 
crank axis were adjusted and standardized the 
relative position between the seat and the crank 
axis of the ergometer to the muscle activation 
pattern of the lower limbs during pedaling [9]. 
The zero degree of crank angle was defined by 
the right crank perpendicular to the ground 
surface. We standardized the sitting position for 
subject to keep his/her knee joint to 110-120 
degrees of flexion with zero degree crank angle 
and one third of thigh at the edge of the chair. 
All subjects were required to test under 3 tasks, 
(a) Free cycling; (b) ES-induced cycling; (c) 
volitional cycling with lower stimulation 
intensity 
Before testing, each condition would be 
carefully explained by the instructor and all 
subjects would have 60 s to practice to familiar 
with the testing conditions. After 2 mins break, 
the 3 conditions would be tested in a random 
order. Between each condition, there would be 2 
mins rest interval. The detailed description of 
each condition was as follows: (a) free cycling 
without ES; (b) ES-induced cycling at the 
chosen stimulation intensity for each subject’s 
tolerated level at a level less than 30mA; (c) 
volitional cycling with lower stimulation 
intensity (the most comfortable intensity in 
10~15mA). The cortical activation patterns

3.2 Brain activity during Cycling 
The cortical mappings based on the task-
related increase of HbO in individual cases are 
shown in Fig 9. The brain mappings showed the 
distinct cortical activation patterns in patients 
during different conditions. The cortical maps in 
stroke patient showed that the regional activity 
of SMC was more prominent than those of other 
regions in each condition indicating the 
important role of SMC in the cortical control of 
pedaling performance with and without ES.  
Moreover, the asymmetrical activation pattern 
was improved in ES-assisted cycling conditions. 
These may imply the sensory stimulation 
induced by ES can enhance the symmetrical 
cortical activation pattern of stroke patients.  
These preliminary results can provide insights 
of the potential efficiency of benefits of FES-
assisted cycling training in the restoration of 
motor function as well as brain reorganization in 
hemiparesis after stroke.

cortex including sensorimotor cortices (SMCs), 
supplementary motor area (SMA), primary 
motor cortex (PMC) in (a) ES-evoked cycling; 
(b) Volitional cycling with ES (c), free cycling 
without ES. 
 
3.3 Cycling performance 
To measure the symmetry of cycling, SI, 
the correlation between EMG LEs of two legs 
after shifting around 180o axis was measured. 
Fig. 10 shows the representative examples of 
EMG LEs of bilateral BF and the measured SI 
of a stroke patient under 3 tasks. These 
observations revealed that pedaling at the 
volitional cycling with lower stimulation 
intensity condition (hybrid activation) can 
induce most symmetrical (SI=0.839) cycling 
pattern in stroke patient.

4.  Conclusion 
 
Our hardware approach can acquire 
volitional EMG and stimulus EMG in real-time 
which has great potential for evaluating the 
hybrid muscle activation during ES-induced 
cycling. The cortical activation patterns during 
ES-assisted cycling seem to facilitate more 
activation of SMC at the affected hemisphere. In 
future study, the real-time information acquired 
can serve as a muscles activation model for 
design control scheme for ES-induced cycling. 
Furthermore, the changes in cortical activation 
by using NIRS which has great potential to 
provide unique findings of brain function and 
organization under hybrid activation of FES-
cycling for motor recovery rehabilitation tasks 
after stroke.
