nitride. In addition, we find that programmed charges spread further into the 
channel as program/erase cycle number increases. 
Reliability issues including erase-Vt state threshold voltage instability, 
read-disturb, and high-Vt state charge loss will be addressed in Chapter 4. First, an 
erase-state threshold drift with storage time is observed in a P/E cycled cell. This 
drift has insignificant temperature dependence and exhibits an anomalous 
turn-around with P/E cycle number. This peculiar phenomenon is strongly related to 
the creation of positive charged defects in the bottom oxide. The temporal evolution 
of the threshold voltage drift has log(t) dependence on storage time and can be well 
described by the tunneling front model. Furthermore, at a sufficiently large read bias, 
positive charge assisted channel electron tunneling dominates the threshold voltage 
shift, causing a power-law time relation. By measuring the dependence of electric 
field and temperature, an analytical model based on Frenkel-Poole emission followed 
by oxide trap assisted tunneling successfully identifies the mechanism for charge loss. 
With use this model, a Vg acceleration method for retention lifetime test is also 
proposed. 
Bottom oxide thickness and program/erase stress effects on charge retention in 
SONOS flash memory cells with FN programming are investigated. Utilizing a 
numerical analysis based on a multiple electron trapping model, the electron 
retention behavior in a SONOS cell with bottom oxide thickness from 1.8nm to 5.0nm 
is simulated. In our model, the nitride traps have a continuous energy distribution. A 
series of Frenkel-Poole excitation of trapped electrons to the conduction band and 
electron re-capture into nitride traps feature the transitions between the conduction 
band and trap states. Conduction band electron tunneling via positively charged

escape by trap-assisted tunneling (Fig. 1.1(b)). This causes a limitation in the bottom 
oxide thickness and thus the channel length and the operating voltage cannot be 
scaled down further in FG flash. According to the device simulation, the channel 
length of NOR type floating gate flash memory cannot be scaled below 0.13µm, as 
shown in Fig. 1.2 [1.6]. In order to solve the dilemma, charge trapping device 
becomes an attractive solution. Ref. [1.7]-[1.10] indicated various candidates for 
trapping material. Among them, nitride-based material has been considered to be the 
most promising candidate for successfully integrated into standard logic process. 
Fig. 1.3 illustrates the development of the nitride-based nonvolatile memory 
device. The early MNOS (Metal Nitride Oxide Silicon) [1.11][1.12] devices of the 
1960s and mid-1970s were used an aluminum gate technology, relatively thick 
nitride (45nm), and thin tunnel oxides (2nm). In the latter 1970s and early 1980s, the 
technology moved into ploy-silicon gates SNOS (Silicon Nitride Oxide 
Semiconductor) [1.13][1.14] cells with reduced nitride thickness (25nm). Later, 
silicon-gate SONOS (Silicon Oxide Nitride Oxide Semiconductor) [1.15]-[1.17] 
devices was proposed in the mid-1980s and 1990. SONOS/MONOS provides the 
most promising structures with an additional top oxide. Holes are blocked from gate 
injection to the nitride as a result of its high barrier (3.9eV). Therefore, memory 
window is widened and nitride thickness can be scaled to around 5nm to 15nm. With 
the thinner effective thickness, SONOS/MONOS can be operated at lower voltage. 
 
1.2 Uniform charge storage versus localized charge storage 
Recently, considerable research efforts have been made to study nitride trap 
storage flash memories for its lower voltage operation, smaller cell size, simpler

example, a “soft hot electron injection” combined with a circuit judgment [1.23] is 
demonstrated to neutralize the positive hole charge. Reduction of the bottom 
thickness is another way to reduce the drift [1.24]. In high-Vt state, Vt loss was 
identified by Frenkel-Poole emission subsequently followed by oxide trap assisted 
tunneling [1.21]. The two-step charge loss closely relates to the bottom oxide 
robustness and/or the nitride trap energy deepness. Nitrided-oxide [1.25] or 
deuterium treatment [1.26] can better the bottom oxide quality. The ratio of SiH4 to 
N2 during nitride film growth has a significant influence on trap energy distribution 
[1.27]. Several groups have investigated the impact of trap energy on retention 
characteristics and attempted to extract the energy distribution [1.28], but some 
deficiencies and misunderstandings exist in their methodology. All previous 
literatures are work on the SONOS cell with an ultra-thin bottom oxide 
(1.5nm~2.5nm). They hypothesized the time through the bottom oxide can be 
ignored and the trapped charges are almost thermally activated in high temperatures 
(>85C). However, in such thicknesses, direct tunneling (DT) rather than thermal 
emission governs the charge loss mechanism even in these high temperatures. On the 
other side, for today’s SONOS cells, a thicker bottom oxide is usually employed, 
causing above hypothesis impractical. With a larger oxide thickness, more factors 
should be taken into account in a charge loss model. For example, a pronounced 
stress-induced oxide trap assisted leakage current is exhibited. In addition, charges 
re-trapping in silicon nitride are also significant [1.29]. This effect is complicated and 
necessitates a numerical technique for accurate modeling. (c) For Nbit cell, the read 
current fluctuation will be worsened due to the threshold voltage non-uniformity 
[1.30]. The design margin will be degraded and cause a failure, especially in

Program/Erase Cycling Induced Endurance Degradation in 
Nbit Flash Memory Cell 
 
2.1 Introduction 
Endurance is an important issue in nonvolatile memory. It is defined by the 
number of data changes that can be performed in every cell of a given memory chip 
before one of the cells fails to meet the data sheet specifications. It describes the 
reliability of a device in terms of the number of program/erase (P/E) operations that 
can be performed on it without failure. Today, most commercially available 
nonvolatile memory products are guaranteed to withstand, at least 10,000 P/E cycles 
[2.1]. In a floating gate memory, electron trapping after numerous P/E cycles in 
tunnel oxide builds up a permanent negative charge, thereby reducing the electric 
field and injected tunneling current for the same applied terminal voltage. For a 
constant program voltage and program time, this reduces the program-state 
threshold voltage whereas increases the erase-state threshold voltage, resulting in a 
threshold voltage window closure problem [2.2]. In Nbit devices, the window closure 
is not observed (Fig. 2.1(a)). Instead, there appears an upward shift of both 
program-state and erase-state threshold voltages after P/E stress. We will discuss the 
cause for this endurance degradation in Nbit cells. 
 
2.2 Endurance Failure in Nbit Cells 
In conventional EEPROM memories, the degradation of the threshold voltage 
 14
in the bottom oxide. Fig. 2.3 is a diagram illustrating the charge distribution in the 
ONO in program state (Fig. 2.3(b)) and in erase state (Fig. 2.3(c)). Qox is negligible in 
a fresh device and increases with P/E stress. The build-up of the bottom oxide charge 
Qox, which cannot be removed by erase, explains the upward shift of the threshold 
window with P/E cycles. 
The relative positions of Qox and QN depicted in Fig. 2.3 are constructed by the 
following measurements. A fresh device and a 100k cycling stressed device are used 
for this study. GIDL current and threshold voltage are measured. GIDL current is 
used as a monitor for the charge in the ONO layers above the n+ drain region while 
threshold voltage can be used to measure the ONO charge in the channel region 
(please refer to Fig. 2.4(a)) [2.6]. First, we adjust the programming bias condition for 
each device to make sure that program-state GIDL current is the same in each device. 
The measured program-state threshold voltage is 4.13V in the fresh device and 4.62V 
in the 100k device. The same GIDL current means the two devices have the same 
amount of charge above the n+ drain. The higher threshold in the 100k cell is believed 
due to the additional stress created oxide charge Qox. Then, the erase characteristics 
of the two devices are measured. Fig. 2.4(b) shows the threshold voltage shift with 
erase time in the two devices. It is interesting to note that the two curves in Fig. 2.4(b) 
are almost identical. Two questions are brought about. First, why the two devices 
have the same erasing speed? This can be understood because the two devices have 
the same GIDL current. The readers should be reminded that GIDL reflects the 
strength of hot hole erasing. Second, why the erasing in the 100k cell stops around 
1millisecond and the threshold voltage shift is the same as in the fresh cell although 
the program-state threshold in the 100k device is about 0.5V higher? This implies that 
 16
of the operation window can be improved by increasing bottom oxide robustness. It 
has been well reported in literature that thinner oxide has less charge creation [2.7]. 
The reduction of bottom oxide thickness should be an effective approach to 
improving the endurance. Another approach is to strengthen the erase bias condition. 
A stronger erase will result in accumulation of excess holes in the nitride to 
compensate for the negative oxide charge or even increases the possibility of 
recombination of injected hot holes and oxide trapped electrons.   
 Fig. 2.6(b) shows the threshold voltage window by using a stronger erase bias.  
Endurance up to 106 cycles can be achieved.

the lateral distribution of programmed charges at the source and drain junctions 
separately without using computer simulation. The devices and measurement setup 
throughout this study will be described. The charge pumping current for single bit 
storage and two-bit storage will be demonstrated. Program/erase cycling stress 
effect on stored charge distribution will be also examined. 
 
3.2 Device Structure and Measurement Setup 
The nitride flash cells used in this work have a gate length of 0.5µm and a gate 
width of 1.0µm. The thickness of each ONO layer is 9nm (top oxide), 6nm (nitride) 
and 6nm (bottom oxide). The cell intrinsic threshold voltage (Vt) is about 1.6V where 
Vt is defined as the gate voltage when the drain current is 1µA at a reverse read 
voltage of 1.6V.  Channel hot electron program and band-to-band hot hole erase 
accompanied by a reverse read scheme are adopted to achieve two-bit per cell 
operation. 
In charge pumping (CP) measurement, the voltage waveforms at gate and drain 
terminals supplied by a two-channel pulse generator are illustrated in Fig. 3.1. The 
employment of a dual-channel pulse generator can circumvent the misalignment of 
gate and drain signal. The gate pulse has a fixed high level (Vgh) and a variable low 
level (Vgl). The Vgh is sufficiently high (Vgh=6V here) to ensure that the entire 
channel at program state is inverted.  
The charge pumping current, named hereafter Icp, is measured at the substrate. 
To probe the lateral extent of programmed charge in the drain side (or the source 
side), Vd (or Vs) is adjusted to modulate the drain (or source) depletion width while 
Vs (or Vd) is left floating. In this way, there is no channel current and thus no impact 
 26
reason is that the drain depletion region increases with Vd. At a sufficiently large Vd 
(in this figure 1.8V), interface traps underneath the program charges are completely 
“masked” by the drain depletion region. Thus, these interface traps can no longer go 
through inversion-accumulation cycles in CP measurement and do not contribute to 
Icp. As a result, the program-state Icp bump is totally suppressed. Our result here 
implies that a Vd about 1.8V is necessary in reverse read to avoid completely the 
second bit effect. In contrast, when Vs is applied in CP measurement, the Icp bump is 
not affected at all (Fig. 3.6). This indicates that programmed charge is highly 
localized near the drain edge. 
 
3.3.2 Two-bit Storage 
The Nbit cell stores two bits at different locations (drain-side and source-side). 
Each bit within a cell serves as binary unit of data that is totally mapped to four 
states in a memory cell. The Icp of the four states corresponding to “11”, “10”, “01” 
and “00” are shown in Fig. 3.7. “00” denotes both bits in program state. “10” (or “01”) 
denotes the drain-side bit in erase state (or in program state) and the source-side bit 
in program state (or in erase state). To explore the influence of the programming 
sequence on trapped charge spatial profile, the charge pumping measurement is 
performed after each bit is programmed. Fig. 3.8 shows the Icp of the first 
programmed bit and the second programmed bit, respectively. Here, the Icp of the 
second programmed bit is obtained in two ways. One is to measure Icp after the first 
bit is erased. The second approach is to subtract the fist bit Icp from the “00” state Icp. 
Fig. 3.9 compares the second bit Icp from the above two approaches and the result is 
almost the same. It should be emphasized that a crossover of the first bit and the 
 28
a broader distribution but a smaller peak density. To explain this result, a 
two-dimensional device simulation is performed. A rectangular charge distribution 
with a width of 30nm and a charge density of 1.6x1019 cm-3 is used. Fig. 3.11 shows 
the lateral channel electric field distribution in the second bit programming. A large 
channel field exists not only in the programmed region but also in the first bit region 
(drain side). Such a large field in the first bit region will accelerate channel electrons 
from the drain and cause earlier hot electron injection into the nitride, thus resulting 
in a broader second bit distribution. Finally, we would like to remark that Eq. (3-2) 
and consequently Fig. 3.10 are derived from a simplified one-dimensional model. For 
a narrow charge distribution by hot electron programming, Eq. (3-2) only serves as a 
first-order approximation. Accurate profiling of programmed charge distribution 
requires a more complicated 2D model. 
The programmed charge lateral extent can be also probed by varying Vd (or Vs) 
in CP measurement. Fig. 3.12 shows the difference in Icp between program state and 
erase state versus Vd (or Vs). ∆Icp is measured at Vgl=1.6V. The 2nd programmed bit 
needs a larger junction bias to“mask” the programmed charge. The same conclusion 
that the second bit has a broader charge distribution is obtained.  
 
3.3.3 P/E Cycling Stress Effect 
The P/E cycling stress effect on programmed charge distribution is examined in 
Fig. 3.13 by using the variable Vd method. The Vt window keeps the same during 
cycling. Again, the ∆Icp is measured at Vgl=1.6V and is normalized to its value at 
Vd=0V to compensate for interface trap creation effect for different cycling stress. It 
has been reported that hot-carrier stress created oxide traps spread toward the

Reliability Mechanisms of Data Retention and Read-Disturb 
in Nbit Flash Memory Cells 
 
4.1 Introduction 
The major advantages of the Nbit cell, as compared with the conventional 
SONOS flash EEPROM, has a better retentivity due to a thick bottom oxide thickness 
[4.1]. The bottom oxide in the Nbit cell is normally thicker than 40Å. Such oxide is 
sufficiently thick to avoid charge direct tunneling [4.2]. The Nbit cell exhibits no 
window loss before P/E cycling. However, after P/E cycled stress, the retentivity 
behavior is degraded, showing a window closure with time (Fig. 4.1). As previously 
stated, the retention loss characteristics are determined by two factors. (a) oxide 
charge (Qox) de-trapping in erase state [4.3], strongly dependent on P/E stress and 
oxide quality [4.4], and (b) nitride charge (QN) loss in program state [4.5], closely 
related to temperature and electric field.  
In this chapter, the reliability issues of the Nbit flash cell including low-Vt state 
threshold voltage instability (room temperature threshold voltage drift, RT drift), 
read-disturb, and high-Vt state charge loss will be reviewed. Responsible 
mechanisms and possible solution will be discussed. 
 
4.2 Room-Temperature Threshold Voltage Drift 
In a P/E stressed cell, the erase-state threshold is found to possess a positive 
drift with storage time (Fig. 4.1). This retention loss exhibits logarithmic

where Qox is the positive oxide charge density, φox denotes the energy barrier of 
positive trapped charges and A is the area of the device. Note that process B exhibits 
a smaller post-stress substrate current because of less positive oxide charge creation. 
The corresponding Vt drift thus has a logarithmic time-dependence,

Fig. 4.6 shows the measured Vt drift in two 10k P/E cycled cells. By comparing 
the two ONO processes, a correlation between the Vt drift and Ib is obtained. Fig. 4.7 
shows the RT drift versus bottom oxide thickness and demonstrates that an effective 
approach to reducing Qox is to use a thinner oxide. In addition, we can vary the erase 
time of the last-shot to study the dependence of the RT drift on QN. For a prolonged 
erase time, QN is less and the RT drift is smaller, as shown in Fig. 4.8. 
 
4.3 Read-Disturb Effects in Erase State  
Read-disturb effect is twofold in the NROM. The word-line voltage during read 
may enhance the RT drift in the neighboring bit. On the other side, the relatively 
large read bit-line voltage may cause channel hot electron injection and result in a 
significant threshold voltage shift of the neighboring bit. The hot electron injection 
caused Vt shift follows either power-law time-dependence or logarithmic 
 48
overcome the stored charge of the second bit, hot electron injection during read 
should be considered. The hot electron read disturb is worsened in a P/E cycled cell 
because of positive oxide charge enhanced electron injection. Fig. 4.14 shows the Vt 
shift versus read bit-line voltage in a fresh device and in a 10k P/E cycled Nbit cell. 
The read disturb increases drastically as the read voltage is above 2V.   
 
4.4 Program state Charge Loss  
The most advantage of trapping storage cells, as compared to floating gate flash 
cells, is the better charge retentivity. Fig. 4.15 and Fig. 4.16 show that high-Vt state 
charge loss has temperature, cycle number and gate bias dependence, respectively. 
These observations suggest that the nitride charge escape is through thermionic-field 
emission and subsequently oxide trap assisted tunneling was proposed (Fig. 4.17). To 
characterize nitride charge escape current, a large area device was stressed at –Vg 
(FN stress) and then was programmed to a high-Vt state by uniform FN injection. 
Trapped charge lateral migration in this case is excluded due to the uniform charge 
injection [4.11]. According to the FP emission model, the nitride trapped charge 
emission time is written below, 
 
)kT/))/qE(qexp(()T*A(t 2/1NNN
2 πε−φ=            (4-4) 
 
where A* is the Richardson constant, φN is the nitride trap energy, EN is the electric 
field in nitride and other variables have their usual definition. The nitride charge 
emission current and the corresponding Vt shift can be derived as follows [4.1],

are extremely low and should be modified by Shockley-Read theory [5.11][5.12]. 
In this chapter, we develop a numerical approach to solve a set of rate equations 
governing the electron FP emission and re-trapping in the nitride and charge leakage 
through the bottom oxide [5.13]-[5.17]. Comprehensive charge loss mechanisms 
based on direct tunneling for trapped electrons and positive charge (oxide hole trap) 
assisted tunneling (PCAT) [5.13] for conduction band electrons in nitride are 
formulated. The effects of bottom oxide thickness and stress created oxide traps on 
charge retention are measured and simulated. The dominant leakage mechanisms for 
different bottom oxide thickness are identified. 
 
5.2 Retention Loss Simulation Model 
The samples used in this work are n-channel SONOS cells consisting of a top 
oxide of TTO=9nm, a silicon nitride of TN=6nm. The bottom oxide thickness (TBO) 
ranges from 1.8nm to 5nm. The measurement data for the Tbo=1.8nm device are 
quoted from [5.18] and other oxide thickness results are measured in this work. FN 
tunneling is employed for programming and erase. This uniform FN injection 
excludes the possibility of stored charge lateral migration in the nitride. 
 
5.2.1 Nitride Charge Dynamics and Loss Mechanisms 
Charge transitions between the conduction band and trap states in the nitride 
and stored charge leakage paths are illustrated in the energy band diagram in Fig. 5.1. 
The change of conduction band and trapped electron densities in the nitride is 
described by the following two coupled rate equations [5.14]-[5.16]: 
 
 64
The pre-factor νe is often referred to as the attempt-to-escape ＂ frequency for 
emission and can be expressed as Eq. (5-3a) where Ncn is the effective density of 
states in the nitride conduction band, υth is the thermal velocity and σN is the nitride 
trap capture cross section. β is the FP constant and En is the average electric field in 
the nitride. τe(φ) is the electron emission time from the trap energy of φN. The free 
electron capture rate coefficient is 
 
)nN(συt),(y,R ttNthNc −⋅⋅=φ      (unit: s-1eV-1)              (5-4) 
 
where Nt is the nitride trap density per unit trap energy. (Nt−nt) is the amount of 
available traps for free electron re-capture. The direct tunneling rate for nitride- 
trapped electron is

where mox* and mN* are electron tunneling mass in the oxide and in the nitride. 
Other variables have their usually definitions. 
As for conduction band electron leakage paths, positive oxide charge assisted 
tunneling [5.13] and direct tunneling through the bottom oxide are considered. 
Charge leakage via top oxide is not considered for a relatively large top oxide 
thickness. The built-in electric field in the ONO stack is neglected for simplification.

with αox (Eq. 5-5a) evaluated at the conduction band edge. With the above rate 
coefficients determined, the nitride charge leakage current JN can be written as 
 
NcDTNcPCATNNtNtN T(t)nRqT)t(nRqt)dxd,(y,nt),(y,RqJ ⋅⋅⋅+⋅⋅⋅+φφ⋅φ= ∫∫  (5-9) 
 
The first term on the right-hand side is the ensemble of out-tunneling electrons 
from nitride traps. The second and the third terms represent charge loss from the 
conduction band via PCAT and DT. It should be mentioned that in a P/E stressed 
device with a thicker oxide, direct tunneling is much smaller than PCAT and Eq. (5-9) 
reduces to 
 
NcPCATN T)t(nRqJ ⋅⋅⋅= .                          (5-10) 
 
5.2.2 Assumptions in Simulation 
Several assumptions concerning the nitride traps in our model should be 
mentioned. First, we assume that the nitride traps have a continuous distribution in 
the bandgap and the trap density decreases exponentially with trap energy, i.e., 
Nt(φ)=Nto⋅exp(-φ/λ), where Nto is set to be 3.0×1019 cm-3eV-1 and λ is the tail 
parameter (0.85eV). This exponential trap energy distribution is often used for 
 68
limitation on time step size for stability. If the time step, ∆t, is too large, the solution 
of y(t+∆t) cannot converge toward the steady solution, exhibited in Fig. 5.2(a). 
Therefore, another “implicit＂backward Euler method which permits the larger time 
step is required. It uses the unknown information at the time t+∆t to calculate the 
solution as formula following.

∆κ+=∆+→
∆+κ−=∆

               (5-11b) 
 
In Fig 5.2(b), the implicit concept is demonstrated and there is no divergent 
solution compared with Fig 5.2(a). The only concern is that to choose an appropriate 
time step to reach the precise solution. 
 
5.3.2 Non-linear and Stiff System 
Here, some nomenclatures should be introduced. First, the differential 
equations in our case are non-linear, containing products of variables. To attain the 
solution, the Jacobian linearization for the non-linear system is essential. 
In the amorphous material (silicon nitride), the eigen-values distribute much 
broadly. Such system is called a “stiff” system of equations. The emission time 
varying over many orders of magnitude is very short or long compared to the 
capture as well as tunneling time. Standard ‘explicit’ scheme is not feasible because 
only the time steps shorter than the critical time constant are used. To realize the 
simulation for long-term retention behavior, the time step must be adjustable. For

Now, the charge density y at time step number k+1 is denoted by yk+1, Similarly,

step, is unknown, but can be found by iteration. By performing a Taylor’s expansion 
of fk+1, and substituting in Eq. (5-14), the iteration scheme is set up, giving for the (s+1)

The initial electron distribution in the nitride layer is obtained as the injected charges 
attain the dynamic balancing between the nitride conduction band and the trap states 
by setting all leakage paths equal to zero. Once the initial condition is determined, 
the conduction band electron and trapped electron densities at the subsequent 
instant can be evaluated step by step. 
 
5.4 Results and Discussion 
5.4.1 Bottom Oxide Blocking Effect 
To investigate the bottom oxide thickness effect, the pre-cycling retention 
characteristics of four SONOS devices with different TBO (1.8nm, 2.5nm, 3nm and 
5nm) are compared in Fig. 5.6. All the devices are programmed to have an identical 
threshold voltage window of 1V. Good agreement between the measured (solid lines) 
and simulated data (symbols) confirms the validity of our simulation model. The 
program state Vt (for example, the 3nm oxide cell) remains almost unchanged for a 
certain period of time and then decreases with a log(t) dependence. The charge loss is 
retarded with increasing bottom oxide thickness. This feature can be well explained 
by a tunneling front model [5.24]. The corner time (τCOR) in Fig. 5.6 corresponds to 
trapped electron direct tunneling time (process (c) in Fig. 1). The role of high-voltage 
stress created oxide traps in charge retention is examined in Fig. 5.7 for Tbo=5nm 
and 2.5nm. The two devices are subjected to a negative FN stress. As opposed to the 
thinner oxide (2.5nm) device, the 5nm oxide cell exhibits an apparent stress effect. 
The post-stress Vt loss in the 5nm oxide device exhibits an initial delay and then 
declines with a log(t) time-dependence. Our calculation in the next section will show 
that the dominant retention loss mechanism in the post-stress 5nm oxide cell is the 
 74
created oxide traps. The conduction band electron density begins to have an 
apparent decrease in the second stage. The simulated nitride trap electron occupation 
factor (ft) versus trap energy at different retention times are shown in Fig. 5.11. The 
FP emission front (φfro), defined as the trap energy with ft=0.5, is displayed in Fig. 
5.12 as a function of retention time. In the first stage, since the nitride charge leakage 
current is limited by oxide trap assisted tunneling, the FP emission front stays 
around 0.8eV. In the second stage, the oxide trap assisted tunneling is no longer a 
limiting mechanism and the leakage current is dictated by the Frenkel-Poole 
emission. As a consequence, the FP emission front moves downward in the nitride 
bandgap with a constant speed in a log(t) scale. For the heavily-stressed sample, the 
oxide leakage current is higher in the first stage and the corner time τCOR is shorter. 
To further elaborate on the τCOR, we use a simplified picture by assuming that the 
nitride charge transitions mainly occur between conduction band and the states in 
the vicinity of the FP emission front (in an energy range of ~kT) as illustrated in Fig. 
5.13. τe(φfro), and τc(φfro) represent electron emission time and capture time between 
the conduction band and the emission front. It should be pointed out that in our 
measurement period τPCAT is much longer than τc(φfro) that the conduction band 
electron density is mainly determined by τe, τc, and the trapped charge density at the 
emission front nt(φfro). Therefore, the nitride charge leakage current in the second 
stage can be readily obtained in the following [5.22].

In above discussion, the role of PCAT in charge loss has been substantiated for 
Tbo=5nm. On the other side, trapped charge direct tunneling is the dominant loss 
mechanism in ultra-thin oxides. It is interesting to investigate the transition between 
these two mechanisms with respect to oxide thickness. Since they are difficult to be 
separated experimentally, a numerical approach is performed. Positive oxide charges 
are placed at the most efficient PCAT position for different oxide thickness. Fig. 5.16 
shows the percentage of the Vt loss from the two components versus oxide thickness 
at T=25C. For thinner oxides (<3nm), nitride charge loss is mainly via direct 
tunneling. The PCAT becomes dominant for oxide thickness exceeding 3.7nm. 
 
5.5 Summary 
A numerical method to simulate the retention characteristics in SONOS flash 
memories has been developed. The dominant Vt loss mechanism is identified for 
different oxide thickness. The Vt loss in a SONOS flash exhibits twos stages. For a 
thinner bottom oxide, the transition time between the two stages is equal to trapped 
charge direct tunneling time. For a thicker oxide, the transition time is related to hole 
trap assisted tunneling time but is prolonged by a factor. No matter of thinner or 
thicker oxides, the Vt retention loss in the second stage obeys a log(t) dependence. 
The dominant mechanism is direct tunneling for thinner oxides and the FP emission 
and oxide charge assisted tunneling can well explain the observed retention 
characteristics in thicker oxide cells.

Extraction of Nitride Trap Density from Stress Induced Gate 
Leakage Current in SONOS Flash Memory 
 
6.1 Introduction 
For SONOS cells, programmed charges are stored in silicon nitride traps. The 
cell programming and retention characteristics are intimately related to nitride trap 
characteristics. Much research effort with respect to silicon nitride process 
optimization has been conducted to improve nitride trap properties. However, 
nitride trap characterization techniques are still very limited at present. Lundström et 
al. estimated a nitride trap density with a direct tunneling model [6.1]. White et al. 
employed a low-frequency (<1kHz) charge pumping (CP) technique to separate 
nitride traps from interfacial oxide traps by a difference in their time-constants [6.2]. 
Later, they extracted a nitride trap density from reverse modeling of threshold 
voltage (Vt) retention loss by combining trap-to-band tunneling and thermal 
excitation of trapped electrons in a nitride [6.3][6.4]. All the above methods, however, 
are restricted to ultra-thin bottom oxides (1.5nm~2.5nm). For today’s SONOS cells, 
for example, NROM or Nbit technology, a thicker bottom oxide is usually employed 
to improve data retention. No appropriate nitride trap characterization methods are 
available for these cells. 
Continued from the preceding understanding (Chapter 4&5), here, we develop 
an analytical model to extract a nitride trap density from the stress induced gate 
current. The effects of programming window (∆Vt) and stress condition on the 
 96
(second stage), the electron occupation factor (ft) of a nitride trap state with an energy 
φΝ has a retention time dependence as follows [6.3][6.4]: 
 
ft(φΝ) = exp[-t/τe(φΝ)] = exp[(-t/τ’)exp(-φΝ/kT)]                          (6−2) 
 
Because the above double exponential changes abruptly from 0 to 1 around φf = (kΤ) 
ln(t/τ’),  ft(φΝ) can be approximated by a step-function at φΝ = φfro and thus φfro is 
referred to as the FP emission front hereafter. This approximation translates into a 
“clear-cut” picture; at a certain time t, trap states above the emission front φfro are 
completely emptied while the states below φfro are occupied by electrons. The FP 
emission front moves downward in SiN band-gap with a speed of dφfro/dt = kT/t, or 
2.3kT per decade of time. The nitride charge leakage current in the second stage 
therefore can be expressed as 
 
IN = AqNt(φfro)⋅ dφfro/dt = AqNt(φfro)⋅kT/t                
(6-3) 
 
and the nitride trap density can be extracted, 
 
Nt(φfro) = IN⋅t/AqkT                  (6-3a) 
 
Since the emission front stays almost unchanged in the first stage (φfro =φ0) and 
begins to move at the corner time (τCOR) of the second stage with a constant speed in 
a log(t) scale, the relationship between φfro and retention time t is readily obtained,  
 98
converges in the second stage. The reason is that the φfro of the two samples at a 
certain time in the second stage is only shifted by kTln(τCOR(B)/τCOR(A))~0.06eV. As 
mentioned earlier, the nitride trap density Nt is almost a constant in the 
measurement range. The leakage current, which is proportional to Nt (Eq. (6-3)), is 
therefore nearly the same in the second stage no matter of stress conditions. 
 In addition, the SILC for different program windows is shown in Fig. 6.4. The 
program window is 3V for sample A and 2.5V for sample C. The sample A has a 
smaller φ0 for more programmed charges. According to the Shockley-Read-Hall 
theory, τe/τc ∝ exp(φfro/kT) and the difference in φo between samples A and C can be 
estimated from the ratio of the SILC in the first stage, i.e,  
 
SILC(first stage) ∝ 1/τeff ∝ exp(-φo/kT)           (6-6a) 
 
and 
 
φ0(A)-φ0(C) = -kTln(SILC(A)/SILC(C))           (6-6b) 
 
The φ0 difference is still small. Consequently, samples A and C have almost the same 
leakage current in the second stage because Nt(φ) can be considered as a constant for 
such small φ0 difference. 
In summary, the extracted nitride trap density from the samples A, B, C is listed 
in Table 6.1. The extracted result is in reasonably good agreement without regard to 
stress condition and programming window.

simplified two-region model. A probability model to portray the read current 
distribution caused by RTN is proposed. Based on our understanding, the read 
current fluctuation can substantially alleviate by better bottom oxide process. 
 
7.2 Experimental Setup 
The SONOS flash cells used in this work have a gate width of 0.35µm and a gate 
length of 0.3µm. Channel hot electron program, band-to-band hot hole erase and 
reverse read are employed. The experimental setup for measuring read current 
variation is shown in Fig. 7.2(a). The sampling rate is 10KHz, which enables the 
observations of read current switching with time resolution up to 0.1ms. Fig. 7.2(b) 
depicts the waveforms of alternate measurement and stress to each terminal. The 
measurement time (tmeas) is chosen to 50ms such that it is long enough for integrating 
reliable signal as well as short enough to avoid introducing additional stress. Fig. 7.3 
shows the read current instability in a SONOS cell after program/erase cycling. The 
read current instability is manifested by a stepwise increase with retention time, 
superimposed by RTN. The stepwise increase is attributed to stored charge escape 
from nitride traps to the substrate. Each current jump corresponds to a single nitride 
charge loss. The RTN in Fig. 7.3 results from the charging/discharging of oxide 
(interface) traps created by P/E stress. The fluctuations in read current imply we 
must allow more margins for reliable sensing in cell design. The impact of RTN in 
different programmed Vt levels of a multi-level cell will be studied below. 
 
7.3 Two-region model 
Since the charges are programmed locally, the channel can be roughly separated 
 108
Because of the higher threshold voltage in region 2, Vs2 is larger than Vs1, while Nch2 
is much smaller than Nch1. Eq. (7-3) can be rewritten as 
 
2
2
s2
L
Vq
I 2
µ∝∆                      (7-4) 
 
Thus, region 2 (high Vt region) dominates the noise fluctuation. The fluctuation is 
increased by a non-uniform Vt distribution due to a small L2. We will verify the 
concept in next section. 
 
7.4 Results and Discussions 
7.4.1 Localized charge storage 
To study the impact of operation mode and charge storage condition on RTN, 
two different programming techniques for SONOS (FN program and CHE program) 
are compared (Fig. 7.5). The former has uniform charge storage and the latter has 
localized charge storage. The two cells experience the same cycling procedure. 
Notably, the RTN amplitude in the localized storage cell (CHE programming) is 
much larger than that in uniform storage (FN programming). This result implies the 
impact of RTN in a localized storage SONOS is more serious than that in a 
conventional floating-gate flash. The two-region model can also response to this 
behavior. 
 
7.4.2 RTN in a multi-level cell 
The amplitude of RTN in different Vt levels of a multi-level cell is evaluated 
 110
Two different oxide processes (oxide A and oxide B) are compared about RTN. 
Oxide B is known to have better oxide endurance from post-cycling charge pumping 
measurement because of NO treatment (Fig. 7.11(a)). The read current with oxide B 
apparently has a tighter distribution (Fig. 7.11(b)) because of less oxide (interface) 
traps. 
 
7.5 Summary 
The impact of RTN is more significant in a localized storage, multi-level SONOS 
flash memory cell. A probability model for the RTN induced read current 
distribution is proposed. The factors affecting RTN, such as charge storage condition, 
programmed Vt level, gate length and P/E cycling, have been characterized and 
discussed. Improvement of bottom oxide robustness can significantly reduce the 
RTN effect.

individually. Intrinsic charge retentivity is superior before P/E cycling. After P/E 
stress, a positive erase-state Vt drift with a logarithmic time-dependence is observed. 
This drift shows a turn-around feature with the cycle numbers, and is found to be 
insensitive to the bake temperature. Positive oxide charge tunnel de-trapping was 
proposed to explain this phenomenon. As the word-line or the bit-line bias increases, 
the positive charge will assist electron tunneling, causing a power law time 
dependence. 
In high-Vt state, charge loss increases with cycle number and shows strong 
dependence on bake temperature and the applied gate bias. Frenkel-Poole emission 
followed by (positive) oxide trap assisted tunneling accounts for the retention loss. 
The square root of the nitride electric field on the Vt loss can confirm the model very 
well. 
In order to further investigate the detailed nitride charge transient behavior 
during retention, a numerical approach describing the electron FP emission and 
re-trapping in the nitride and charge leakage through the bottom oxide is developed. 
The nitride charge leakage current after stress is found to have two-stage feature. The 
first stage is dominated by the stress-induced (positive) oxide trap assisted featuring 
a DC-like evolution and a strong stress dependence, while the second stage is 
dictated by nitride charge Frenkel-Poole emission exhibiting a 1/t time relation and 
almost no stress dependence. We can use the stress-independence 1/t transient 
current to extract the nitride trap density. In our case, the extracted nitride trap 
density is around 7.0x1012 cm-2eV-1. 
Finally, the read current fluctuation due to random telegraph noise in a 
localized storage, multi-level SONOS flash memory cell is investigated. Threshold
