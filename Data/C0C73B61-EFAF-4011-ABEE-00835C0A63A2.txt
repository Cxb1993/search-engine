1.   Introduction 
Yager (1993) initiated a study of ME-MCDM (Multi Expert-Multi Criteria 
Decision Making) problems under ordinal contexts. In the ME-MEDM 
evaluation process, Yager used the weighted minimum operator (Dubois and 
Prade 1985; Yager 1981) to aggregate the rating of all criteria of an alternate as 
the unit score of the alternative and then used the ordinal OWA (ordered 
weighted averaging) operator (Yager 1988, 1992) to obtain an overall evaluation. 
This ordinal OWA operator is an ordinal version of the ordinary OWA operators 
(Yager 1988) and has been extended under various contexts, see, e.g. Godo and 
Torra (2000), Herrera and Martínez (2000), Wang and Hao (2006) and Yager 
(2007). Meanwhile, in the literature, many contributors provide various 
techniques for managing non-homogeneous information that can be represented 
as values belonging to domains with different nature as linguistic (ordinal), 
numerical and interval valued or can be values assessed in label sets with 
different granularity, multi-granular linguistic (ordinal) information, see, e.g. 
Herrera et al. (2005), Li (2007), Xu (2007), Zarghami et al. (2008) and Zou et al. 
(2008). 
      Grabisch (1995) presented a synthesis on the use of fuzzy integral as an 
aggregation operator in multicriteria decision making and, relying on the 
characterization of OWA operators found by Fodor et. al. (1995), characterized 
OWA operators as Choquet integrals. For a concrete representation of OWA 
operators, in real numbers environment, as Choquet integrals, see, for example, 
Calvo et. al. (2004). 
     Recently, Hao and Wang (2008), based on the notion of floating position 
index (see Figure 2), introduced (floating) position-based quantile (p-quantile) 
and (floating) position-based OWA (P-OWA) aggregation operators for real and 
ordinal scores in MCDM problems. 
     In this article, we study a variant of ME-MCDM problem, which is addressed 
on the selection among alternatives based on the evaluation of each alternative 
by the corresponding (distinct) group of persons according to the same criteria. 
The evaluation of every person for each criterion is represented by a 
proportional ordinal 2-tuple (Wang and Hao 2006) and the overall opinion is 
aggregated by a pair of quantifier guided OWA and AV-OWA (anchoring value-
based ordered weighted averaging) operators, the latter is an extension of the P-
OWA operator. We show that the aggregation operators used in the algorithm of 
this article can be represented, in a similar way as in (Calvo et al. 2004), by the 
Choquet integral. Moreover, the Choquet integral for the decision function of the 
algorithm can be accomplished alternatively by a Choquet integral of Fubini type. 
     The structure of this work is as follows. In Section 2, the variant of ME-
MCDM problem studied in this work is formulated. In Section 3, the required

     In Fig 1, the position indices )( ispi  of Ssi ∈  are equally spaced on a real 
line R  which can be easily interpolated with positive number indices between 
them. This motivates us to interpolate ‘ordinals’ into each is  and its successor 
through the position index function )(⋅pi  on S  as follows. 
Definition 1: Let },,,{ 10 gsssS   L=  be an ordinal scale set (with the less 
preference order < ) and )(⋅pi  be the position index function of S . For each 
],0[ gr  ∈  with β+= ir , where )(rIi = , I  is the integer part function and 
)1,0[)( ∈−= rIrβ , we formally associate a pair of ordinals with proportions 
)},(),,1{( 1+− ii ss   ββ  to denote an interpolating label between is  and 1+is  which 
has the position index r . Graphically, it is represented in Fig 1. The pair 
)},(),,1{( 1+− ii ss   ββ  will be denoted as ),)1(( 1+− ii ss ββ   for short and is called 
a symbolic proportion pair with a pair of symbolic proportions β−1  and β . 
The set of all the symbolic proportion pairs that associated with all ],0[ gr  ∈  
will be denoted by S . 
Definition 2: Let },,,{ 10 gsssS   L=  be an ordinal scale set and S  be the 
ordinal proportional 2-tuple set generated by S . Define ],0[: gS  →pi  by 
)1()))1(,(( 1 αααpi −+=− + iss ii  , where 1,,1,0 −= gi   L , and ]1,0[  ∈α . 
pi  is called the position index function of ordinal proportional 2-tuples. 
     Under fuzzy linguistic contexts, the concept of canonical characteristic value 
(CCV) (Wang and Hao 2006, 2007) was used in (Wang and Hao 2006) to define 
OWA aggregation operator for aggregating linguistic information that is 
represented by linguistic proportional 2-tuples. To appeal such techniques to 
ordinal information represented by S , we need the concept of anchoring value 
(AV) functions of S  which is defined by the same conditions of the concept of 
CCV functions of a linguistic variable but ignore the semantics of linguistic 
labels. 
Definition 3: Let } ,, ,{ 10 gsssS L=  with gsss <<< L10  be an ordinal scale 
set and ϕ  be a real-valued function defined on S , where S  is the ordinal 
proportional 2-tuple set generated by S . Then ϕ  is called an AV function on S  
if it satisfies the following conditions:

called an anchoring value-based quantile operator (abbreviated as av-quantile 
operator) with floating anchoring value p  on S  (see Figure 2). 
     The notion of normalized floating anchoring value is similar to the notion of 
normalized floating position index in (Hao and Wang 2008), and the operator 
ϕ ,pQuan  is a generalization of the operator pQuan  in (Hao and Wang 2008).

5.   Example 
To enlarge the scope of business, an entertainment enterprise plans to build a 
new picture theater somewhere. There are several options for its location city. 
Suppose that there are four cities—Taipei, Taichung, Tainan and Kaohsiung, 
under consideration. The final decision depends on many criteria. One of the 
most important criteria is the business potential for different cities. To get useful 
(and objective) evaluation on the criterion of the business potential, the 
managing director asks one of the company’s analysts to conduct a marketing 
survey for the issue. The analyst designs a questionnaire to collect the 
consumers’ opinions. The questionnaire is composed of a fixed number of 
questions to analyze the consuming intendancy of the interviewee. The analyst 
wants to use the aggregated result, based on the majority ordinal scores of the 
questions in the questionnaire, to represent the overall opinion of the interviewee, 
so he/she chooses the OWA operator as the aggregation operator for the data in 
the questionnaire. Since the retrieving samples of the four cities may be different 
but should be quite large amount, the analyst chooses the AV-OWA operator as 
the aggregation operator to collect the overall opinion of all the interviewee in 
the corresponding city to represent the business potential for the city. To 
simplify and for easy to illustrate, the linguistic (ordinal) data needed in this 
example is assumed as follows:  
     Let us assume that the ordinal information used in the questions of the 
questionnaire is scaled by the ordinal term set 
 High, Medium, Low, ,LowVery  ,None{ 43210 ≡≡≡≡≡= sssssS  
Extreme} High,Very  65 ≡≡ ss . 
Practically, the number of interviewee in a marketing survey is quite large. Here, 
as a demonstration, suppose there are 10, 8, 12 and 9 persons from Taipei, 
Taichung, Tainan and Kaohsiung being interviewed respectively. Moreover, for 
simplicity, we assume that the questionnaire has five questions and the data of 
the corresponding interviewee for the four cities are denotes as 1M , 2M , 3M  
and 4M  respectively, which has been rearranged, as in Step 1 of the algorithm, 
as follows:

So, the aggregating result of the data from Taipei is )28.0,72.0( 32 ss . By the 
same process, the aggregating results of the data from Taichung, Tainan and 
Kaohsiung are )35.0,65.0( 32 ss  )65.0,35.0( 32 ss  and )2.0,8.0( 32 ss  respectively. 
Therefore, Tainan has the best business potential. 
 
6.   Discussion 
We outline the decision policy of the previous algorithm and its mathematical 
heuristics as follows: 
•As was suggested by (Yager 1993), the information aggregation problem can be 
considered as that we are interested in obtaining some (utility) function which is 
appropriate for evaluating the validity of hypotheses (or alternatives). This kind 
of function can be viewed as being composed of two parts. The first part 
provides some indication of the significance of the information (in this article, 
criteria and experts) we are using to make the decision and the second part 
provides an indication of how well the hypothesis (alternative) under 
consideration is supported by the information (criteria and experts) being 
considered. Moreover, one can use the fuzzy measure to provide an indication of 
the significance of the information.  
•In this article, we follow the discipline stated in the last paragraph. Note that 
there are various ways to aggregate the ordinal scores (information) in the 
problem in Section 2. In the previous algorithm, Step 1 is a preparation to make 
sure that the aggregation operators being used can be represented as the Choquet 
integral of the associated performance functions with respect to the fuzzy 
measure determined by the fuzzy quantifiers q  and Q  in Step 2. In particular, 
this will justify the decision function of the previous algorithm can be defined 
alternatively by the Choquet integral of Fubini type. For a detailed discussion, 
see Appendix A. 
•The decision policy of the previous algorithm is that, the decision-maker is 
satisfied with quantifier Q  persons of the corresponding group 
0iG  of the best 
alternative 
0iA  being agreed on quantifier q  criteria. The reasons of choosing 
ϕγ  ,Quan  as the aggregation operator in Step 3 are as follows. First, in the

A decision making technique is described for the selection among n alternatives based on 
the evaluation of n (distinct) group of persons according to the same m criteria. The 
evaluation of each person for each criterion is represented by a proportional ordinal 2-
tuple and the overall opinion is aggregated by a pair of quantifier-guided OWA and P-
OWA operators which can be accomplished alternatively by a Choquet integral of Fubini 
type.  
1.   Introduction 
Yager [13] initiated a study of ME-MCDM (Multi Expert-Multi Criteria 
Decision Making) problems under ordinal contexts. In the ME-MEDM 
evaluation process, Yager used the weighted minimum operator [2, 10] to 
aggregate the rating of all criteria of an alternate as the unit score of the 
alternative and then used the ordinal OWA (ordered weighted averaging) 
operator [11, 12] to obtain an overall evaluation. Since then, in the literature, 
many contributors provide new tools for aggregating (weighted) ordinal 
information, see, e.g. [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. 
     In this article, we study a variant of ME-MCDM problem, which is 
addressed on the selection among alternatives based on the evaluation of each 
alternative by the corresponding (distinct) group of persons according to the 
same criteria. The evaluation of every person for each criterion is represented by 
a proportional ordinal 2-tuple [8] and the overall opinion is aggregated by a pair 
of quantifier guided OWA and P-OWA (position-based OWA) operators [6, 7, 
8]. The latter operators can be defined, in a similar way as in [1, 3], by the 
Choquet integral.

π  is called the position index function of ordinal proportional 2-tuples. 
     Under fuzzy linguistic contexts, the concept of canonical characteristic value 
(CCV) [8, 9] was used in [8] to define OWA aggregation operators for 
aggregating linguistic information that are represented by linguistic proportional 
2-tuples. To appeal such techniques to ordinal information represented by S , 
we need the concept of anchoring value (AV) functions of S  which is defined 
by the same conditions of the concept of CCV functions of a linguistic variable 
but ignore the semantics of linguistic labels.

5.   Discussion 
We outline the decision policy of the previous algorithm and its mathematical 
heuristics as follows: 
•As suggested by [14], the information aggregation problem can be considered 
as that we are interested in obtaining some (utility) function which is 
appropriate for evaluating the validity of hypotheses (or alternatives). This kind 
of function can be viewed as being composed of two parts. The first part 
provides some indication of the significance of the information (in this article, 
criteria and experts) we are using to make the decision and the second part 
provides an indication of how well the hypothesis (alternative) under 
consideration is supported by the information (criteria and experts) being 
considered. Moreover, one can use the fuzzy measure to provide an indication 
of the significance of the information.  
•In this article, we follow the discipline stated in the last paragraph. Step 1 is a 
preparation to make sure we can define the aggregation function as the Choquet 
integral of the performance function with respect to the fuzzy measure 
determined by the fuzzy quantifiers q  and  in Step 2. Q
•The decision policy of the above algorithm is that, the decision-maker is 
satisfied with quantifier Q  persons of the corresponding group  of the best 
alternative  being agreed on quantifier q  criteria. The reasons of choosing 
 as the aggregation operator in Step 3 are as follows. First, in the 
previous problem, distinct alternative  is evaluated by different group  
which may have different cardinality and hence aggregation by a P-OWA 
operator is more convincible than by an OWA operator since the computation 
result of the former is more convincible than the latter. Second, as was stated in
