Abstract 
Aging in population has become a social 
problem. Since the physical and 
psychological conditions of aged people 
have changed, their social activities reduce 
dramatically. For these people, increase the 
satisfaction of social life is very important. 
With the advance of Weblog technologies, 
many people use it as a platform for 
expressing and exchanging their opinions 
and emotion freely. Therefore, people with 
similar interests can get together online to 
share their emotion and interests. In order to 
help aged people improve their social life, 
the objective of this research was to elicit 
their demands and provide guidelines for 
user interface design of Weblog tools based 
on the empirical results of prototype 
evaluation. This project consists of two 
phases. In the first phase, the methods of 
field study, interview, and questionnaire 
survey were employed to acquire the 
knowledge about how aged people act in 
their social life. From this study, the needs 
of new interface for aged people were 
obtained. In the second phase, the prototypes 
of Weblog system were constructed based on 
the results of this study and literature review. 
In addition, aged people were invited to 
participate in the experiments and carry out 
typical tasks for usability study. The 
guidelines for designing a Weblog system 
for aged people were developed for the 
reference of Weblog designers and engineers 
in the future.

addition, for these elder users, the primary 
content areas in learning how to use the Web 
are learning how to use electronic mail and 
accessing health information and 
information about traveling for pleasure. 
This research provided the issues that must 
be faced in order to increase use of the 
World Wide Web in middle-aged and older 
adults. 
To provide research-based guidelines 
for web site design, some researchers 
published a checklist to ensure the 
accessibility of website for senior visitors 
[6]. Although this checklist was not 
exhaustive, designers could use it to solve 
partial problems encountered in webpage 
design. 
 
 
3. RESEARCH METHODS OF SOCIAL 
LIFESTYLE SURVEY 
In order to study the social lifestyles of the 
elders, questionnaire surveys were conduced 
among 30 people (12 female and 18 male). 
The mean and standard deviation of their 
ages are 60.19 and 4.95, respectively.  
To study their social communication 
styles, each question in the questionnaire 
was accompanied with an open question that 
inquired the participant if he or she had 
encountered any inconvenience in his or her 
social lifestyle. The questionnaire had been 
designed to understand their expectations 
and preferences for weblogs. Their 
responses showed that telephone was the 
major communication tool in their social life. 
However, they did encounter some problems 
while using the telephone as the 
communication tool. These problem 
includes the person to contact might be 
away and out of home while calling, certain 
concerns might be too embarrassing to 
express through phone, the phone number of 
the person to contact might be unavailable, 
and it’s difficult to talk to someone and 
initiate the conversation if they had not meet 
each other for a long time. Their responses 
showed that Blogs could be a potential 
solution to solve these problems. 
Since few people at this age had the 
experience of using Blogs, the participants 
were invited to create their own Blogs on a 
remote and representative hosting website 
with the help of the researchers at their 
home. After performing typical tasks on the 
Blog, they were asked to complete the 
questionnaire. First, participants indicated 
the degree of frequency in using ten 
different media sources through a 7-point 
Likert scale. Second, participants selected 
the items from a list or provided their own 
reasons that would drive them to blogging. 
In the last part, participants answered 44 
questions about their styles of learning based 
on Index of Learning Styles [7]. 
Furthermore, Chi-square tests were adopted 
to analyze the effects of knowledge sources 
and learning styles on their motivations of 
using Blogs. 
In order to categorize the elders based 
on their knowledge sources, the degree of 
frequency in using different media were 
used as the feature for Hierarchical Cluster 
Analysis. Therefore, three groups of 
participants were identified (Table 1). The 
first group (9 participants) used TV 
programs as the major media. The second 
group (9 participants) preferred reading 
newspaper and chatting with people. The 
third group (12 participants) adopted a wide 
variety of media, such as TV, newspaper, 
magazines, books, or Internet. Table 2 listed 
the percentage of different motivations for 
hosting a Blog or visiting others’ Blogs. It 
showed that, overall, more than 20% of 
participants were willing to exchange their 
knowledge through Blogs. In addition, the 
effects of knowledge sources on the 
motivation of using Blogs were analyzed. 
The results indicated that more than 60% of 
the people in TV-dominant group and more 
than 40% of the people in Multi-source 
group were willing to use Blogs as the 
platform for knowledge exchange. However, 
no one in Newspaper and chatting oriented 
group would like to use Blogs as the 
platform to deliver their knowledge and 
experience (χ2(2) = 8.828; p = 0.012). 
Furthermore, The Index of Learning 
Styles [7] was used to identify the style of 
participants in processing learning 
information. According to Felder-Silverman 
(FS) model, people might have the tendency 
to belong to one category or the other in

4.1.1. The Elog prototype 
The design of Elog embraced the common 
features of communications software 
available on the market today to enable the 
user to locate the needed function intuitively 
and quickly. As shown in Figure 2, the top 
left area was the information display panel 
and below it was the input area. The main 
function buttons were placed in the right 
side of the screen. When the comment 
button was clicked on, the names of visitors 
would appear automatically in the input 
window.

4.1.2. The Pholog prototype 
As shown in Figure 3, familiarity was the 
primary appeal in the front page 
arrangement of Pholog. To prevent rejection 
from individuals in the target group who had 
no experience with computers, the image of 
the traditional telephone dial was adopted in 
Pholog. One other difference from Elog was 
that in Pholog both display and input were 
placed in the same window and could be 
switched from one to the other by clicking 
on the corresponding button. Additionally, 
the latest comments and visitors were placed 
in the main menu so that the user could 
access them as soon as the software was 
activated. 
To simplify application of Pholog, there 
were the icons of a telephone receiver and a 
pencil to elicit users’ intuitive response. 
When users wanted to write their Blogs, all 
they need to do was click on the receiver or 
pencil to enter the pertaining function.

4.1.3. Differences between Elog and 
Pholog 
There are four major differences between 
Elog and Pholog. They are as follows: 
(1) Difference in Blog Writing Function 
Activation: To activate the text writing 
function in Elog, the user clicks on the Blog 
writing function button and write in the 
window that pops up. In Pholog, the user 
clicks on a separate Blog writing button in 
the main menu to enter the input window.  
(2) Difference in Entering the 
Comments Function: In Elog the commenter 
name list is placed at the bottom of the 
comments function page. In Pholog the 
latest comments and visitors are shown 
directly in the main menu; the user can click 
on them to view the details. 
(3) Difference in Main Page Design: 
Elog was designed to be “intuitive.” Since 
the two mainstream operating systems 
available today, namely Windows and Mac, 
adopt linear arrangement, Elog is therefore 
designed to conform to the experience of 
most computer users except the operation is 
more intuitive. On the other hand, Pholog 
was built to be “familiar.” The design 
included the image of the early telephone 
dial that was a part of old telephone sets 
before 1970s but has since been a rare item. 
The dial symbolizes the memory of the 
target group. It is a metaphoric approach of 
product design. Both interfaces are quite 
different in either the click button design and 
arrangement or the outlook. 
(4) Difference in Display Windows: 
The two interfaces are different in the size 
and location of display windows and page 
arrangements. The window heights are

Significant differences were discovered after 
data analysis using t-test. They were shown 
in Table 3.

In the subjective evaluation for task two – 
Blog writing, the “degree of satisfaction 
with the Send button design” was higher for 
Photog than for Elog; therefore, Pholog 
came out as the better and favored interface. 
The reason was the Blog writing function 
button in Pholog was the icon of a pencil – a 
concrete image (Figure 4) that suggested the 
user to click on it to activate the function. 
When the writing was completed, a second 
click on the pencil would upload the text. 
Many participants expressed the pencil icon 
button offered a sense of familiarity. 
Moreover, the animated effect that appeared 
when the icon was clicked on made the 
operation more fun. In comparison, the Send 
function in Elog was only represented by 
written words (Figure 5). As much as it 
coincided with what most users were 
accustomed to, it seemed less appealing.    
As for objective measurement, the time 
taken to complete listening to voice 
comment was shorter with Elog than with 
Pholog.

According to the experiment results, actual 
interviews and observations, the following 
suggestions for Blog design for aged people 
were concluded. (1) The function buttons 
should be enlarged and the explanatory text 
should be clear and precise. (2) The Send 
button for uploading written texts should be 
larger than the other buttons. Animated 
effects to confirm completion of sending 
would be a plus but it may cause confusion 
if the animations take up an overly large 
proportion of the screen. (3) The display 
area for Blog text writing and the text 
contents should be as large as possible. 
When the front page arrangement and the 
display area are impossible to compromise, 
a screen-switching button can be considered. 
Some participants expressed that it was 
more comfortable to read texts without 
buttons in sight. (4) The voice recording 
should be accompanied with a voice-to-text 
conversion function. Misunderstandings 
from unclear speech can be avoided when 
both voice and text approaches are both 
available. (5) The overall appearance of a 
Blog front page should be consistent and the 
buttons should be organized according to 
their functions. If the frequently used 
functions (such as Blog text writing, for 
instance) are placed too far apart, users may 
overlook some of them. (6) Linear 
arrangement of the main Blog functions is 
better and easier for new users. 
  
 
5. CONCLUSION 
Before this study, no blogs had been 
designed specifically for aged people. 
Therefore, this study can be regarded as a 
start and a new effort. This study was begun 
with an initial survey, which was then 
followed by the conceptualization of what a 
Blog for aged people should be like. After 
referring to related literature and the 
investigation results, Blog writing, 
comments, photo browsing and the regular 
contact list were concluded as the basic 
functions a Blog should have. With Blog 
writing, browsing and comments targeted as 
the key areas of examination, this study has 
developed two sets of prototypes that are 
quite different from their counterparts used 
in all major Blog sites available today. The 
primary considerations in the development 
include: (1) Avoid having too many 
functions but keep only the main functions. 
(2) Disregard the frameworks of all the Blog 
software available today and plan something 
new with the needs of aged people in 
consideration. (3) Design breakthrough 
functions for aged people. (4) Make it 
simple, easy to learn and familiar.  
    In spite of the addition of the traditional 
phone dial in the design of Pholog as a 
suggestive measure, the results from 
experiments show that Elog was a better 
interface in several areas and this was 
because the overall design and arrangement 
of the front page and click buttons coincided 
more with the experience of users. 
The two Blogs designed for this study 
for aged people are simple, easy-to-learning, 
easy-to-use and pleasant-looking. They also 
include the suggestive design concept and

Based on the results of lifestyle survey, two Blog platforms suitable for 
aged people were developed. The Elog had the appearance of most 
communications software available today and an easy-to-identify 
comment list, whereas the Pholog showed an old-time telephone dial 
and gave aged users a sense of familiarity.

Abstract 
 
Recently, many research groups have dedicated 
their efforts to the development of Weblog (or Blog) 
tools to facilitate cooperative learning. However, these 
tools were mainly for young students in regular 
courses at schools. For adult learners, especially 
elderly people, lifelong learning is also important in 
their everyday life. Therefore, it is valuable to study 
the possible development of these tools for such a user 
group in the future. The objective of this research is to 
study the effects of knowledge sources and learning 
styles of the elders on their motivations to use Weblog 
tools for lifelong learning. Field studies and 
questionnaire surveys were conducted to elicit their 
requirements. The results showed that both knowledge 
sources and learning styles had significant effects on 
the willingness to use Blogs as the platform to 
exchange their knowledge and experience.   
 
1. Introduction 
 
With the advent of Blog technologies, many 
researchers had considered the possibility of using 
Blogs for cooperative learning [1] and distance 
learning [2]. Their findings suggested that Blogs were 
effective for students to document their learning, share 
experience and knowledge, have direct interaction with 
peers especially internationally [2]. Although many 
people had benefited from Blog technologies, these 
tools were designed mainly for young people. The 
physical and psychological limitations of elderly 
people did not obtain much attention. Therefore, it is 
important to study possible changes of current Blog 
tools for the elders, especially from the perspective of 
their individual differences in learning.  
2. Research method 
 
In order to study the effects of knowledge sources 
and learning styles of the elders on their motivations to 
use Weblog tools for lifelong learning, questionnaire 
surveys were conduced among 30 people (12 female 
and 18 male). The mean and standard deviation of their 
ages are 60.19 and 4.95, respectively. Since few 
people at this age had the experience of using Blogs, 
the participants were invited to create their own Blogs 
on a remote and representative hosting website with 
the help of the researchers at their home. After 
performing typical tasks on the Blog, they were asked 
to complete the questionnaire. First, participants 
indicated the degree of frequency in using ten different 
media sources through a 7-point Likert scale. Second, 
participants selected the items from a list or provided 
their own reasons that would drive them to blogging. 
In the last part, participants answered 44 questions 
about their styles of learning based on Index of 
Learning Styles [3]. Furthermore, Chi-square tests 
were adopted to analyze the effects of knowledge 
sources and learning styles on their motivations of 
using Blogs. 
 
3. Results 
 
In order to categorize the elders based on their 
knowledge sources, the degree of frequency in using 
different media were used as the feature for 
Hierarchical Cluster Analysis. Therefore, three groups 
of participants were identified (Table 1). The first 
group (9 participants) used TV programs as the major 
media. The second group (9 participants) preferred 
reading newspaper and chatting with people. The third 
group (12 participants) adopted a wide variety of
