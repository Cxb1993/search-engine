英文摘要 
As the complexity of integrated circuits 
increases, the demanding for system 
applications is more and more urgent. 
Among them, bio-system chip is both an 
important and a new technology. Since few 
bio-system chips are now available the 
development is very urgent for practical 
applications. Therefore, this project is 
dedicated to important analog interface 
circuits for bio system chip with research 
emphasis on low voltage, low power, low 
noise and high resolution techniques. In 
the first year, the key research target is 
design and implementation of high 
resolution and low power 1.8V, 18 bit 
sigma-delta modulator. 
 
As compared to the most advanced prior art, 
the research target is very innovative and 
challenging. Those high performance 
circuit techniques for biomedical signal 
conditioning will be realized to meet the 
required design specification and time 
schedule. Development results of this 
project shall be very innovative. Besides, 
this project shall be very helpful to both 
the academic research and technical 
progress of microelectronics community as 
well as student training on

二、與會心得 
IEEE 亞太電路與系統國際會議是為電路與系統領域研究學者及業界專家的年度
技術交流盛會，參與的歐美學者專家及學生人數亦不少。今年投稿論文，經評審
後共收錄 472篇論文。論文討論的主題包括有類比電路與系統、VLSI設計及 VLSI 
CAD、算術電路、低功率電路與系統、數位及類比信號處理、影像處理、感測器
元件與電路、多媒體系統、電力電子、微機電技術、生醫應用電路、放大器、濾
波器、穩壓器、高頻電路與元件、有線與無線通信電路系統，以及奈米電子等等。
由於議程內容非常豐富，因此個人選擇議程中較感興趣的主題場次，穿梭會場進
行聆聽各國學者專家研究成果。藉由參與此次會議的機會，進一步掌握電路與系
統技術發展的趨勢及瞭解詳細技術內容，實在是獲益良多。 
 
此外，個人在此次研討會中的論文發表安排在“Voltage regulators & 
References II”場次。這是近兩年來執行國科會補助計畫“積體電路雜訊偵測
關鍵技術研究”計畫的部份研發成果。在本篇論文中，我們將傳統的峰值偵測器
加以改良後，應用在偵測電壓源雜訊上，其特點為﹕(1) 可偵測在某時段內最大
之電壓源雜訊值，將其電壓值保持於電容，以便於下一級電路處理，使得下一級
電路對工作速度的要求限制變小; 及(2) 可偵測頻率達 1GHz，大小值在 10% VDD 
~ 45%  VDD 電壓源之雜訊信號。在電流相同情況下，本篇論文所提出電路比傳
統電路速度提升兩倍。這些特色，使得所提出電路在工作時，功率會小很多，節
省能量消耗。 
 
本場次原先安排 5篇論文報告，排定前兩篇論文討論參考電壓源電路設計，但前
兩篇作者皆未出現，因此只有 3篇論文進行宣讀。第一篇論文討論音頻放大器電
路中的 PWM及遲滯控制兩種設計方式，論文中完成兩種電路設計，並進行測試晶
片的製作與量測，結果很完整。最後一篇論文則是討論內建在晶片中的高電壓產
生電路，透過電磁作用感應出的電壓 150mV (peak voltage)，經由 charge pumping
電路產生穩定 1.8V 輸出電壓，而最大電流約 30 uA。雖然本場次僅有 3 篇論文
報告，但聽眾對本人及最後一篇論文，提出很多問題，討論非常熱烈，幾乎用完
整個場次時間。 
 
A High Performance Peak Detector Sample and Hold Circuit 
for Detecting Power Supply Noise

Abstract – A new method to detect the power supply 
and ground noise (PSN) in ICs is proposed in this paper. 
We improve the conventional peak detector sample and 
hold circuits (PDSH) and apply them to detect the PSN. 
The maximum overshoot or undershoot noise will be both 
detected and held in a holding capacitor. This 
consequence enables the next processing circuit to operate 
conveniently without further speed restriction. The noise 
detector is verified able to detect 1 GHz PSN with the 
magnitude from 10% to 45% VDD within 5% error. As 
compared to the prior art, both the detection range and 
speed are improved significantly. 
 
I. Introduction 
 
With the advancement of processing technology of 
integrated circuits (ICs), the channel length of MOS 
transistors becomes shorter and the circuit can work faster. 
Both the threshold voltage and the power supply become 
lower to reduce the power consumption. However, the 
density per unit area becomes higher. In high density ICs, 
the spacing is shortened between circuits and therefore the 
interaction effect increases. The power supply is lowered, 
but the noise becomes relatively larger. The noise 
immunity is then greatly reduced. Therefore, the research 
of noise voltage values and respective distribution 
becomes more and more important. 
 
A modified peak detector sample and hold circuit is 
presented. The proposed circuit can detect the maximum 
noise and holds its value. The circuit is verified able to 
detect the power supply and ground noise of 1GHz of the 
magnitude from 10% to 45% VDD. As compared to the 
prior art, both the detection range and speed are improved 
significantly. 
   
The VDD line and VSS line which connect the power 
supply and ground, respectively, with a chip are made by 
bonding wires, as shown in Fig. 1. When the current 
flowing in the VDD line and VSS line changes abruptly, 
both the inductive noise and resistive IR drop noise will 
arise. 
 
 
Fig. 1 Equivalent model of bonding wires in a chip 
 
Fig. 2 shows all four different kinds of power supply 
and ground noises (PSN). They are the power supply 
voltage (VDD) overshoots, VDD drop, ground voltage 
(VSS) overshoots and VSS drop, respectively. The 
detector proposed in this paper is used to detect the 
maximum noise of these four kinds and the value of the 
noise voltage will be held to provide for use in the next 
processing circuits. The PSN detectors can be distributed 
in the chip and the detected PSN in different blocks will 
help us know the real noise distribution.

II. Conventional Peak Detector Sample and Hold 
Circuits 
 
The conventional peak detector sample and hold (PDSH) 
circuit is shown in Fig. 3 [1] with the timing diagram of 
operations given in Fig. 4. One complete operation 
includes three phases including Reset, Sample, and Hold 
time intervals. In the reset phase, the control signal “reset”

charge over the maximum voltage value of VDD 
overshoots. Initially, Vin is almost equal to Vout, the base 
voltage can be neglected. When Vin is higher than Vout, 
M1 turns on and C begins to charge to the maximum value 
of Vin. However, when M1 turns on, the equivalent 
impedance of msf1 becomes small and it will let Vin drop 
in very short time. Here we add the PMOS mco to solve 
this problem. As M1 turns on, mco turns on, too. Both the 
equivalent impedance of msf1 and msf2 become small to 
reduce the error. In the other hand, mco is an additional 
charge path in order to compensate the Vin drop and the 
delay of M1 turn-off. As compared to the strength of 
PMOS mop4 and mop5, the size of both PMOS mop6 and 
mop7 is very small. They compose a cross-coupled circuit 
to make the OP more sensitive to small noise signals [3].  
 
 
 
 
Fig. 6 VDD overshoots detector 
 
The gain of the OP is designed to 15.5dB (about 6x) in 
1GHz and phase margin is 60 degrees. It can properly 
operate about from 0.75V to 1.65V. Assume the gain of 
SF is 0.8. If the minimum value of noise we design to 
detect is 10% VDD (0.18V), as shown in the equation 
below, for ac analysis, it is easy to turn on the PMOS M1 
and mco.

The key point is the main charging path though the 
MOS “msf2”. The current of SF must be large enough, 
otherwise the error would become large to lead to the 
wrong detecting value and circuit failure. Following the 
equation VCIt Δ×=×Δ  , the used capacitance C is 
0.25pF. The bigger value of capacitance, the more tolerant 
to diffusion capacitance. Assume the △V is 50% VDD 
and the charging current “I” is constant, if the △t is 
smaller than 100ps, the “I” has to be  larger than 
2.25mA. 
 
By the same idea, we design other detectors of VDD 
drop detector, VSS overshoots detector and VSS drop 
detector, as shown in Table I, respectively. The “SF-” is 
made up of NMOS and it will let the VDD shift down a 
Vth and the “SF+” is made up of PMOS and it will let the 
VSS  shift up a Vth. The “OP-N” is mainly an NMOS 
input differential pair amplifier and it can properly operate 
from 0.75V to 1.65V. The “OP-P” is a PMOS input 
differential pair amplifier and it will operate correctly 
from 0.2V to 1.1V.

IV. Simulations 
 
Simulations are performed by Hspice based on process 
parameters of TSMC 0.18um CMOS technology. The 
error of base voltage in Fig. 5 is produced initially when 
M1 is too late to turn off, as shown in Fig. 7. The sine 
wave is used as the power supply noise whose  magnitude 
is from 10% to 50% VDD (1.8V) and the frequency is set 
at 500MHz for example. The control signal “reset” resets 
the capacitance every 10ns. Note that there is charging 
over the peak value.

Fig. 8(a) and 8(b) are the simulation results of VDD 
overshoots detector of the proposed PSN detector shown 
in Fig. 6. In Fig. 8(a), the noise in VDD assumes random 
noises. In Fig. 8(b), the declined sine wave is used as the 
power supply noise whose magnitude is about 10% ~ 50% 
VDD (1.8V) and the frequency is 1GHz. The control 
signal reset resets the capacitance every 10ns. When VDD 
overshoots are 50% VDD, the error voltage is 33mV. As 
VDD overshoots are 30% and 10% VDD, the errors are 
only 7mV and 13mV, respectively.
