weather monitoring). An attribute can also 
belong to different events. Aside from this, 
attribute values are also scalar. The 
distributed index for the multi-dimensional 
data (DIM) scheme [4] is the design of a 
distributed index that supports 
multi-dimensional range queries. It uses a 
geographic embedding of a classical index 
data structure and is built upon the GPSR 
geographic routing algorithm [3]. Events 
falling into the range space are routed to and 
stored in a node according to its 
corresponding zone.  
In a large scale network, data 
communication is the main energy consumer. 
Therefore, the design of the network 
protocol is an important issue. In this project, 
we propose a scheme for determining the 
distribution of events based on the values of 
their attributes. We extend the data-centric 
storage architecture to efficiently support 
range queries where only events with 
attributes in a certain range are desired. 
 
(四) 方法說明 
In DIM, during the routing of an event to 
a most appropriate zone, the destination 
zone often changes. Hence, this would 
increase the insertion message cost. 
However, in large scale networks, data 
communication is the main energy consumer. 
From simulation results shown in DIM, we 
can observe that DIM is not adaptable to 
skewed data; that is, the hotspot problem 
affects the performance of the DIM. 
Therefore, a new storage scheme that 
enables the insertion of multi-dimensional 
attributes events, which can achieve load 
balance and reduce message cost, is 
absolutely needed. 
The design goal of our system is to 
provide an energy-efficient and scalable 
approach towards multi-dimensional queries 
in sensor networks. Our design for 
achieving this goal is composed of two parts: 
data insertion and query processing. The 
data insertion mechanism stores detected 
events at appropriate nodes in a 
corresponding range space, while the query 
processing mechanism analyzes a user query. 
This query may subdivide a given range 
query into multiple sub-queries, routing the 
sub-queries to the nodes in the relevant 
range space, and retrieving the matching 
events.  
A. Data Insertion Mechanism 
In this section, we show how to insert an 
event into a node. There are two parts 
involved in insertion: a hashing algorithm 
for mapping an event to a range space, and a 
routing algorithm for storing the event in an 
appropriate node. 
(1) Hashing an Event to a Range Space: 
Let us denote these attributes as a1, a2, … , 
a2m. When a source node generates an event 
E of k-dimensional attributes, event E is 
assigned a k bit code, where k is equal to the 
number of attributes, 2m. This value of k is 
known to every node. Furthermore, in order 
to simplify the attributes values, we assume 
that all attribute values have been 
normalized to be between the range of 0 and 
1. 
We describe how a k bit code is assigned 
to an event in the following. For i between 1 
and 2m, if 0≦ai< 0.5, the i-th bit code is 
assigned 0. If 0.5≦ai≦1, the i-th bit code is 
assigned 1. For xj = a2j-1 and yj = a2j, 
attributes values of event E is assigned a 
serial of bits code: code B = [x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., 
xm, ym ]. For example, let us consider the 
event E = [0.8, 0.7, 0.4, 0.3]. The first 
attribute, 0.8, is bigger than 0.5, so the first 
bit code is assigned 1. The second attribute, 
0.7, is bigger than 0.5; therefore, the second 
bit code is assigned 1. The third attribute, 
0.4, is smaller than 0.5, so the third bit code 
is assigned 0. The last attribute, 0.3, is 
smaller than 0.5, so the last bit code is 
assigned 0. For this event E, the 4-bit code 
is code B = [x1, y1, x2, y2] = 1100. Code B 
can also be obtained through Equations (1) 
and (2). The key idea of our algorithm is to 
map a multi-dimensional event to a node in 
the corresponding range. Hence, after the 
event E has been assigned a k-bit code B, E 
 —   — 4 
route the event E to the corresponding range 
space. The source node exploits GPSR in 
order to send a message toward the centroid 
of that range space. Its message contains 
two fields: the range space R and the 
centroid geographic location of that range 
space. As a message routes into the range 
space, the first node in the range space 
receives the message and stores the event. 
Since this is used by greedy-mode 
forwarding in GPSR, it is often the shortest 
path from the source to the range space. 
 
 
 
Figure 1.  Inserting two events in the same range space. 
 
Because every sensor node may generate 
events, the events that are mapped to the 
same range space could be routed from 
different directions and stored at different 
storage nodes in the same range space. 
Therefore, load balancing is achieved 
among nodes in the sensor network. In 
Figure 1, there are two events, E1 and E2, 
which occurs at two nodes. According to our 
hashing algorithm, both of them are mapped 
at the same range space, R = (0.5~0.625, 
0.875~1). The messages of event E1 and E2 
are routed into this range space from the 
lower left and upper right side, respectively, 
of the network. Then, each event is stored in 
the first node, which receives the message in 
the range space. Events are therefore stored 
in different nodes rather than in only one 
node in the same range space. 
 
B. Querying Processing Mechanism 
The query processing mechanism is 
composed of two parts: the query resolving 
and the retrieval events. The query resolving 
function of the design is to determine a set 
of relevant range spaces that are able to 
provide answers to the query. The retrieval 
events fetch events that match the query. 
The querier (the node issuing the query) 
requests a multi-dimensional range query Q 
= < [L1~U1], [L2~U2], …, [L2m~U2m] >, and 
it subdivides this range query into multiple 
subqueries. After splitting the k-dimension 
range query, each attribute is assigned a bit 
code. Then, tuples of k-bit code, code B, are 
composed. Splitting the range query is done 
as follows. If the range of Q’s i-th attribute 
contains the value 0.5, the querier divides Q 
into two subqueries—one of whose i-th 
attribute range is between Li and 0.5, and 
another between 0.5 and Ui. If the i-th 
attribute range is between Li and 0.5, the i-th 
bit code is assigned 0, but if the other range 
between 0.5 and Ui, the i-th bit code is 
assigned 1. Therefore, we can get the tuples 
of the k-bit code, code B, and use Equations 
(1)−(5) to map each subrange query to its 
relevant range space R. For instance, in a 
3-dimension range query, Q = <0.2~0.6, 
0.7~0.8, 0.3~0.4>, the query Q can be split 
into two subqueries, q0 = <0.2~0.5, 0.7~0.8, 
0.3~0.4 >, q1 = <0.5~0.6, 0.7~0.8, 0.3~0.4 >. 
For q0, its code B is 010, and for q1, its code 
B is 110. Through Equations (1)−(5), each 
subquery could be mapped to a relevant 
range space R. For q0, its relevant range 
space is R0 = (0 ~0.25, 0.5~1), and for q1, its 
relevant range space is R1 = (0.5~1, 0.5~1). 
Therefore, these subqueries would be routed 
to their individual range spaces. 
Upon receiving a subquery, a node would 
flood the subquery with nodes in the same 
range space. These nodes answer the 
subquery with matching events values, and 
the retrieved qualifying events are sent back 
to the querier through the same path. In this 
way, the entire query forwarding paths form 
a tree that enables the consumption of

 (六) 結論 
 
In this project, we have proposed a data 
storage and range query mechanism for 
multi-dimensional attributes in wireless 
sensor networks. Our scheme maps 
multi-dimensional events to their 
corresponding range spaces and builds an 
in-network distributed data structure. Our 
scheme uses the GPSR routing protocol to 
deliver an event to a sensor node closest to 
the source node in the corresponding range 
space. Our performance evaluation shows 
that our proposed scheme can reduce 
message costs and hotspot problems to 
achieve load balancing even when there is a 
vast number of events and sensor nodes in a 
sensor network.
