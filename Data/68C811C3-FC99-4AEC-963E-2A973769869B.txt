英文摘要 
We developed a novel CMOS architecture 
that uses mechanical tensile stress, induced by 
the Si nitride-capping layer, together with the 
pseudomorphic compressive stress in SiGe layer 
to improve the drive current of both n- and 
pMOSFETs simultaneously. The unique 
advantage of this process flow is that on the 
same wafer, individual MOSFET performance 
can be adjusted independently to their optimum 
due to the separation process for two type 
devices. It is found that n- and pMOSFET in the 
novel CMOS architecture behaved better 
performance, not only higher drain-to-source 
saturation current but also higher 
transconductance with wide gate voltage swing, 
than the Si-control devices, thus making this 
flow to show a great flexibility for developing 
next-generation high-performance CMOS. 
二、計畫的緣由與目的 
Ways of optimizing channel mobility need 
to be explored in order to overcome the 
limitations on the scaling down of devices and 
further improve the speed of CMOS circuits. A 
promising candidate to reach this demand is to 
exploit the strain-induced band-structure 
modification. The introduction of tensile 
strained-Si on relaxed SiGe for nMOSFETs 
[1]-[3] or compressively strained-SiGe layer on 
bulk-Si for pMOSFETs [4], [5] can enhance for 
individual electron and hole mobility. Therefore, 
the design of a CMOS process combining both a 
tensile-strained-Si for nMOSFETs and a 
compressively strained-SiGe for pMOSFETs, 
which fabricate on one structure or one chip, to 
enhance the electron and hole mobility 
simultaneously will be extremely required. A 
good solution to this problem is to use 
dual-channel structures with complexly tensily 
strained-Si layer and compressively 
strained-Si1-xGex layer on a fully relaxed Si1-yGey 
virtual substrate (x>y) [6], [7]. The experimental 
results give a good design rule for the Si-cap 
layer thickness based on this structure to 
optimum nMOSFET and pMOSFET 
performance: thicker Si-cap layer for nMOSFET 
and thinner Si-cap layer for pMOSFET.

etching (RIE). Then, BF2 with energy of 15 keV 
and a dose of 5×1015 cm-2 was used as the 
source/drain of pMOSFET and body of 
nMOSFET ion implantation. Besides, 
pMOSFET body region and nMOSFET source/ 
drain region were using As implantation with 
energies of 20 keV at a dose of 2×1016 cm-2.

CMOS device structure. The contact metal is 
Ti/AlSiCu. 
After the ion implantation, a silicon nitride 
layer with a thickness of 100 nm using LPCVD 
was deposited. This SiN cap layer was used as a 
stressor which makes the Si channel of 
nMOSFET under tensile strain to improve 
electron mobility [9]. Then, and a 600-nm-thick 
BPSG was subsequently deposited to passivate 
the exposed surface of the device structure. The 
post-implant annealing was performed by rapid 
thermal annealing (RTA) at 900 °C for 30 s in 
order to activate the impurities by ion 
implantation and improve the quality of oxide. 
Then, the source, drain, gate and body contact 
holes were formed by dry etching. Subsequently, 
the Ti/Al-Si-Cu alloy by sputter was taken as the 
metal layer. Finally, the post-metal annealing 
was performed at 450 °C for 30 min in H2/ N2 
forming gas. For comparison, the control Si 
without SiGe film growth and SiN film 
deposition which instead by 100-nm TEOS was 
fabricated together. 
The samples were characterized by an 
on-wafer test using an HP-4156C semiconductor 
parameter analyzer and HP-4284A precision 
LCR meter for dc measurement. The effective 
mobility effµ  was determined by a split 
Capacitance-voltage (C-V) method which was 
extracted from a long-channel device with 
100-µm-gate length and 200-µm-effective gate 
width. Fig. 2(a) shows effective hole mobility as 
a function of effective electric field. Due to holes 
reside primarily in the higher mobility SiGe 
layer over a large gate-voltage range, the sample 
exhibit larger mobility enhancement. Moreover, 
from the improved mobility curve, the 
high-quality SiGe epitaxy was confirmed and 
stable film property was still sustained during 
full process sequence. On the other hand, the 
proposed nMOSFET sample exhibits slightly 
higher electron mobility at high vertical field as 
shown in Fig. 2(b). This is a result of the heavy 
mechanical stress produced by a SiN layer.
