source with wavelengths shorter than 380 nm 
is needed to excite the electrons in the 
valence band into the conduction band of a 
TiO2 lattice with an anatase structure. 
The incorporation of metal ions and/or 
anions into the TiO2 crystal lattice can 
significantly extend the absorption into the 
visible-light region [2-6]. Asahi et al. [8] 
have prepared TiO2-xNx films by sputtering 
TiO2 targets for several hours in a 40% 
nitrogen/argon gas mixture followed by 
annealing in N2 gas at 550 ℃ for 4 h to 
produce visible light (λ=436 nm) responsive 
photo-catalysts. The TiO2-xNx films formed 
in this way had improved photocatalytic 
properties. The fact that these films led to an 
enhanced photocatalytic activity under 
visible light, such as the degradation of 
methyl blue (MB) or of gaseous acetaldehyde 
(CH3CHO), was proof that an N-doped TiO2 
lattice resulted in a narrower band gap [8]. 
Recently, Suda et al. reported the deposition 
of TiO2-xNx films prepared on heated Si and 
SiO2 substrates at temperatures of 400℃. 
They used the pulsed laser deposition method 
with a TiN target in a nitrogen/oxygen gas 
mixture [9]. They found that the structure 
and properties of the film largely depended 
on the target material and the nitrogen 
concentration ratio in the gas mixture. 
Meanwhile, TiO2-xNx films prepared on 
heated Si substrates at temperatures of 300℃ 
using a rutile-TiO2 target in an ion-assisted 
electron-beam evaporation system have been 
found to exhibit photo-induced activity. In 
this case the dependence on N2 partial 
pressure was also observed [10]. Chen et al., 
however, reported that the photocatalytic 
activity of the N-doped TiO2 films, prepared 
by medium frequency magnetron sputtering 
over an aqueous solution of benzamide was 
only improved under UV illumination. In this 
case the optical absorption thresholds of the 
N-doped films were still below 370 nm 
wavelength [11]. 
There are various techniques for 
depositing N-doped TiO2 thin films. For 
instance, chemical vapor deposition [12, 13], 
pulsed laser deposition [9], flame synthesis 
[14], electron beam evaporation [10], 
reactive magnetron sputtering [11] and the 
sol-gel process [15]. Among these techniques, 
the reactive sputtering technique has been 
widely used for obtaining large-area uniform 
and dense TiO2 thin films with a 
well-controlled stoichiometry [16]. 
Nevertheless, the above-mentioned studies 
were all carried out using heat treatment or 
calcinations at temperatures exceeding 500℃, 
which is an undesirable method when either 
glass slides or non-refractory or low-cost 
substrates are involved. To the best of our 
knowledge, visible-light responsive N-doped 
TiO2 films prepared on unheated glass 
substrate by DC magnetron sputtering have 
not yet been reported. In this study, we aim 
to optimize the N2 flow rates for preparing 
the N-doped TiO2 films. By doing this, we 
hope to demonstrate an improved 
photocatalytic activity by illuminating a 
solution of methyl blue with various light 
sources. 
 
2. Experimental procedure 
In this work, N-doped TiO2 films were 
deposited on unheated glass slide (25×75×1 
mm) substrates using a twin DC magnetron 
sputtering system (W300×D300×H400 mm). 
The target was metallic titanium (99.5% 
purity) to which a DC current of 3.2 A was 
applied. The target-to-substrate distance was 
fixed at 60 mm. A gas mixture consisting of 
30% oxygen in 60 sccm of O2/Ar was 
introduced into the chamber while the N2 
flow rate was varied from 10 to 35 sccm with 
an increment of 5 sccm. A partial sputtering 
pressure of 0.27 Pa was maintained during 
film deposition. All the N-doped TiO2 films 
appeared vivid and bright yellow. We use the 
denotation Nx-TiO2 for the N-doped TiO2 
thin films where “x” represents the N2 flow 
rate in sccm. As a reference, a sample 
N0-TiO2 film with a measured thickness of 
1750 nm was prepared under optimal 
conditions, but without introducing N2 gas. 
The properties of the N-doped TiO2 film 
were characterized by X-ray diffraction 
(XRD), Raman spectroscopy, atomic force 
microscopy (AFM) and X-ray photoelectron 
spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The 
spectra of the Ti2p, N1s, and O1s peaks were 
calibrated with respect to the C1s peak with a 
binding energy of 284.6 eV. 
 4
incident light can be attributed to the rougher 
surfaces of the DC-sputtered films. The 
absorption of the N-doped TiO2 films 
occurred at a longer wavelength in the 
visible-light spectrum than that of N0-TiO2. 
The absorption threshold increased with the 
N2 flow rates. This can be ascribed to the 
occurrence of oxygen vacancies in the 
mid-band gap that allow the electrons to 
transfer across the energy gap into the 
valence band. This causes the shift observed 
on the visible-light spectrum [25]. Note that 
the N25-TiO2 film exhibited more or less the 
same transmittance spectrum as the 
N30-TiO2 film. 
 
3.4 Photocatalytic activity 
Figure 4 shows the result of MB 
degradation under UV-365, BLED and 
GLED irradiation for 24 h and also under 
sunlight irradiation for 4 h. These results 
indicate that MB was decomposed by the 
N-doped TiO2 catalysts via a photocatalytic 
reaction even at wavelengths longer than 500 
nm. The photocatalytic ability of the 
N-doped films decreased as the N2 flow rates 
increased under UV-365 irradiation. This 
may be the result of hole/electron 
recombination centers induced by 
DC-sputtered and N-substituted oxygen 
vacancies [26-27]. 
Under visible-light, BLED or GLED 
illumination, the MB degradation rate 
increased with the N2 flow rate, reaching the 
summit at 30 sccm. Under sunlight 
irradiation, however, the N25-TiO2 film 
resulted in the most active MB degradation 
of all the samples. This is partly due to 
equally high surface hydroxyl coverage and 
partly due to the absence of the formation of 
a heterogeneous TiN phase [23], as indicated 
by the XRD and Raman analyses. The 
photocatalytic degradation of the MB 
solution has been reported to increase 
significantly as a consequence of surface 
roughness, which was ascribed to the 
enlarged surface area after post heat 
treatment [7]. Others found no significant 
relationship between the photocatalytic 
degradation of CH3CHO or MB and the 
root-mean-square roughness (RMS) of the 
sputtered and sol-gel film [27], or CVD 
deposited film surfaces [28]. Although the 
N30-TiO2 film exhibited the largest amount 
of light absorption and the highest specific 
surface area of 1.20 and an RMS of 11.1 nm 
which were determined by AFM, it was less 
active in terms of photocatalytic activity. 
These results are due to the increasing 
number of trap sites formed by the excessive 
atomic β-N dopants in the film, creating 
more photo-generated carriers to be captured 
and making it more difficult for 
photo-generated carriers to be transferred to 
the film surface where reaction takes place 
[11]. N-doping was therefore found to 
enhance the absorption of visible-light. The 
high surface hydroxyl groups (OH － ) 
coverage of the N25-TiO2 thin film was 
found to be the reason for its high 
photocatalytic activity under sunlight 
irradiation [29]. This is confirmed by the 
XPS analysis in the following section. 
 
3.5 XPS analysis 
The XPS analysis aimed at the 
binding energy from the N25-TiO2 film - the 
highest degree of MB degradation under 
sunlight irradiation - in relation with various 
light sources herein. The chemical states of 
the constituent elements, i.e. Ti2p, O1s and 
N1s, in the N-doped TiO2 films prepared at 
different N2 flow rates were examined with 
XPS on as-deposited as well as on Ar ＋
-etched samples. The relative intensity of the 
carbon spectrum decreased very fast from 
~40% on the as-deposited surface to a few 
percent after being etched for 60 s by argon 
ions. The N1s XPS binding energy on the Ar
＋-etched surface of the N25-TiO2 film had a 
clearly noticeable peak at about 396.1 eV, as 
shown in Fig. 5. This peak, referred to as 
atomic β-N, was assigned to the 
substitutional N in the lattice and was 
reported in relation with the active sites of 
the photo-catalysis [8, 10]. The other two 
peaks at 400.1 and 402.1 eV that appeared on 
the as-deposited surface (not shown in the 
figure) were attributed to the presence of 
chemisorbed N2 molecules onto the surface 
[8, 30]. As expected, the intensity of the 
atomic β-N remained strong while that of the 
chemisorbed N2 molecules diminished. This
