Abstract 
Ultrasound has been extensively used in 
medical application, not only in diagnostic 
imaging, but also in therapy or surgery to kill 
tumors by high intensity and focused ultrasound. 
There are many advantages to using ultrasound; 
for example, noninvasive, portable, and 
convenient. In this work, several experiments 
were designed to investigate the ultrasonic 
properties of liposomes that could result in 
liposome leakage. The underlying premise of 
this study is that by carefully tailoring the 
composition of liposomes, their responsiveness 
to ultrasound can be enhanced. In particular, we 
designed liposomes that are significantly more 
responsive to ultrasound than are cell 
membranes, in order that they could be used in 
biomedical applications. Also, the various 
properties of ultrasound will be discussed.

二、實驗目的 
A. Might the coupling differ depending on 
 3
different lipid acyl tails and head groups.  
The liquid temperature increases not only by 
the direct action of ultrasound, through viscosity, 
but also through the collapse of cavitation 
bubbles. The local temperature increase could 
reach several thousand Kelvin after bubbles 
collapse; this temperature causes free radical 
formation and sonoluminescence. Liposomes 
could be disrupted by the extreme high 
temperature. Note also that some lipids undergo 
a lamellar-to-inverted hexagonal phase transition 
at elevated temperatures, and local conversion to 
the inverted hexagonal phase should cause 
permeabilization. [Collins et al. 1989] 
 
C. Composition could affect liposomes 
self-healing? 
Lipids form liposomes in water solution at 
very low concentration critical micellar 
concentration (CMC) is about 1pM. Curvature 
and packing factor of lipids affect the phase of 
lipid bilayers. Mixing several kinds of lipids in 
liposome can lead to phase separation, 
depending on the phase transition temperature 
and structure of the lipids. MPPC and DPPC 
have the same phase transition temperature; 
however, the liposomes with this composition 
become more permeable near Tm. The reason 
might be that holes in these liposomes have 
stabilized edges, because the MPPC lipids are 
easier to form micelles. 
 
三、實驗方法與步驟 
A. Lipid: 
The lipids 1, 2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-Glycero-3- 
Phospho-choline (DPPC), 1-Palmitoyl-2- 
Hydroxy-sn-Glycero-3-Phospholine (MPPC), 
L-a-Dioleoyl Phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), 
N-4-Nitrobenzo-2oxa-1,3-Diazole Phosphatidyl- 
ethanolamine (NBD-PE), N-Lissamine 
Rhodamine B sulfonyl) Dioleoyl- phosphatidyl- 
ethamine (Rh-PE) were purchased from Avanti 
Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) and used without 
any purification.  
B. Fluorescence: 
8-aminonaphthalene-1, 3, 6-trisulfonic acid, 
disodium salt (ANTS), 5-(and-6)-carboxy- 
4’,5’-dimethylfluorescein *mixed isomers*, 
1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) and 
p-xylene-bis-pyridinium bromide (DPX) were 
from Molecular Probes, Inc (Eugene, OR). 
Fluorexon (Calcein) was from Aldrich Chemical 
Company, Inc. (Milwaukee, WI). Fluorimeter 
SLM AMINCO 8000 was from SLM 
Instruments, Inc.  
C. Ultrasound Instrument: 
Toneburst interface card TB-1000 and 
Analogy converts to digital card SR 9010 were 
from Matec Instrument Companies 
(Northborough, MA), transducers V323-SM, 
V317-SM (central frequency 20MHz), with 
nominal element size and central frequency were 
6mm and 2.25MHz, 20MHz, respectively. 
V212-SM with central frequency 20MHz and 
4.3μs delay line is for ultrasound attenuation 
coefficient measurement. All transducer were

MA).  
D. Buffer and solvent: 
Sodium chloride, disodium ethylenedi- 
amine-tetraacetate (EDTA) and acetonitrile 
(MeCN) were obtained from Fisher Scientific

(before ultrasounds was applied to the system), 
and Imax maximum fluorescence intensity after 
Triton X-100 addition. The initial rate of the 
fluorescence increase was analyzed in terms of 
initial slopes (ΔF/Δt). 
 
 
四、結果與討論 
The second result is about the leakage rate 
of liposome with or without ultrasound applied. 
In this experiment, the compositions of 
liposomes are DPPC and DPPC with 10% 
MPPC and with 4% DSPE-PEG2000. From Fig. 
2., the leakage of calcein from 
90%DPPC/10%MPPC is 5~10% higher than 
100%DPPC of total calcein encapsulated at 
36oC after 30minutes of 2MHz and 0.06% duty 
cycle ultrasound applied. At the same time, the 
temperature was sat form 31 to 37oC. Needham 
and coworker report that the phase transition 
temperature of 90%DPPC/10%MPPC and 
100%DPPC are the same. The leakage rate of 
90%DPPC/10%MPPC, however, is about 2 
times higher than 100%DPPC under 2MHz and 
0.06% duty cycle ultrasound treatment for 
30minutes under phase transition temperature. 
But when the testing temperature was 36oC, the 
leakage rates lower for nonrelaxation frequency. 
Ultrasound increases the liposome that 
temperature sensitive release. Note: above tm, 
ultrasound has less release. Discuss 
concentration. 
A. Ultrasound absorption of Egg Yolk PC 
Liposomes: 
1. Calculation of ultrasonic attenuation and 
reflection of liposomes 
 The ultrasonic signals from the Matec 8100 
ADC card was shown in the Figure 2. It 
contained two series of signals: the first stronger 
repeat peaks were caused by the delay line of the 
transducer. Another series of signals were the 
reflection of incident sound wave from the 
bottom of the chamber, and called echo #. First 
two echoes were taken for attenuation 
calculation, because they had higher S/N. They 
were processed by Fourier transform (FFT), and 
transferred form time domain to frequency 
domain. The reflection of stainless steel and 
quartz were quite high and low, respectively, so 
the signal losses by reflection were negligible. 
The amplitude ratio of second to first echo is the 
attenuation of sound wave passed through the 
suspension. 
2. Excess of attenuation 
The comparison of the ultrasonic 
absorption of HEPES buffer and Egg Yolk PC 
liposomes made by passing 200nm and 1000nm 
filter were shown in Figure 3. The excess 
absorption per wavelength was [Sano et al. 
1982] 
( ) 2( )excess fv Bf
ααλ = − ,     
   (16) 
Clearly, 200nm liposomes had higher absorption 
than 1000nm liposomes for same amount of 
lipids. Some researcher even included the 
ultrasonic scattering into a part of attenuation 
[Babick et al. 1998]. Sano et al.[Sano et al. 1982] 
concluded that that the excess absorption per 
wavelength and relaxation time of SUVs and 
LUVs are 3x10-3, 18nsec, and 5x10-3, 22nsec, 
respectively. Considering the population effect 
of liposomes, the absorption of a LUV was 
about 10 times higher than a SUV, in other 
words, the ultrasound of scattering for a larger 
liposome was higher than a smaller liposome. 
This was probably because of larger liposome 
with larger surface area and multilamellar 
structure. Both 200nm and 1000nm liposomes 
 7
the negative pressure needed up to about 10MPa 
to cause cavitation in a bubbles free system. 
Watery buffer was an incompressible fluid, so 
the pressure fluctuation had not a big effect on 
this system. For the resonance phenomena, the 
relaxation time of SUVs or LUVs were 18 to 22 
nsec, i.e., frequency range were from 55 to 
45MHz, and they were not in our experimental 
frequency range. MPPC and DPPC are both 
quaternary ammonium, their reactivity with OH- 
are much smaller, i.e., volume change might be 
less than -0.5cm3/mol theoretically. The actual 
volume change in each reaction needs to be 
calculated in liposomes ultrasonic attenuation 
measurements. So, the major factor might be the 
absorption of ultrasound by liposomes and 
convert the energy to heat, on the other hand, the 
minor effects could be amplified in a specific 
system and more physical properties should be 
measured precisely. 
 
C. The anisotropy of DPH in liposomes 
The measurements of the anisotropy of 
liposomes were essential to test the phase 
transition temperature of the liposome only or 
the freedom of the probes (DPH) in liposomes 
when some additives or energy were reacted 
with lipid molecules. When pure DPPC 
liposomes with DPH probes inside, the 
anisotropy had dramatically dropped around 
41.8oC; however, this drop of anisotropy was 
shift to around 40oC if the ultrasound was 
applied, so ultrasound might induce liposomes 
leakage mechanically. The anisotropy 
measurement probably can only provide the 
leakage temperature of liposomes would be 
lower than normal, but still it can’t explain the 
reason is either local temperature increase or 
lipid molecules movement.

with different frequency, the molar volume 
change, and relaxation frequency could be 
fitting. The possible reaction and conformation 
change might be also illustrated. The ultrasound 
sensitivity of liposomes could be investigated. 
Cavitation is more likely to happen at lower 
frequency (<<3MHz), so sending the ultrasound 
to liposomes with same intensity at different 
frequency can test if cavitation induces more 
liposomes to leak. Applied ultrasound with the 
frequency that could induce cavitation on 
liposomes of differing composition could prove 
that the vesicle-monolayer transformation rate 
constant is related with liposome leakage rate. 
Liposome compositions: in the preliminary 
result part, liposomes with 10% MPPC are more 
sensitive than pure DPPC with 0.06% duty cycle 
ultrasound treatment. The kinetics is not well 
understood; we assume that ultrasound causes 
the MPPC lipids to form transient pores. 
Ultrasound with higher power or duty cycle will 
be applied to liposomes. If transient pores are 
being formed, the leakage will increase rapidly 
until ultrasound was stopped. We will compare 
the leakage rate with temperature effects, 
resealing or healing rate could be found. If 
leakage is caused by transient pores, leakage 
should stop quickly when ultrasound stops. If 
pores on the membrane survive longer with 
MPPC lipids, cessation of leakage when 
ultrasound is turned off will be slower.
