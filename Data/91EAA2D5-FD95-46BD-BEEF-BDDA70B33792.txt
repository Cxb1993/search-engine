Abstract 
Two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) correlation spectroscopy has been employed to investigate 
the temperature-induced molecular re-arrangement and the electro-optic switching process of a 
ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC). The 2D IR correlation technique clearly reflect the exhibition of 
the thermal fluctuations in the azimuthal angle of the FLC director about a tilt cone (Goldstone 
mode) in the SmC* phase. The temperature-induced reorientations are dependent on the molecular 
fragments. Asymmetric responses of the surface stabilized FLC to positive and negative driving 
pulses was also revealed in the 2D IR correlation analysis, indicating that the 
clockwise–anticlockwise symmetry about the cone axis is broken at the molecular level.

2. Experimental procedures 
The SSFLC cells investigated consist of two CaF2 plates coated with indium tin oxide (ITO) 
conducting films and polyimide alignment layers rubbed unidirectionally. The substrates were 
assembled in a homogeneous geometry with 1.5 μm cell thickness to form a surface stabilized 
structure. The pretilt angle is controlled to be about 2o. A ferroelectric liquid crystal 
(S)-(-)-1-cyano-2-methylpropyl 4-(4'-(5-hexenyloxy)biphenyl-4-carbonyloxy)benzoate (CMHCB; 
Fig. 1) was filled into a test cell at a temperature above the isotropic phase. The test cells were then 
slowly cooled to 108 oC, which is in the temperature range of SmC* phase.

Time-resolved FTIR spectra from 900 to 3500 cm-1 with 4 cm-1 resolution were recorded with 
a commercial continuous-scan FTIR spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled HgCdTe 
detector and home-made data acquisition electronics. Bipolar square-wave pulses were used to 
excite the SSFLC cell. The waveform includes a +15V field-on duration extending from 0 to 140 
μsec, followed by a field-free period from 140 to 500 μsec. Then a -15V duration extends from 500 
to 640 μsec, followed by a field-free period from 640 to 1000 μsec. For each polarization angle of 
the incident infrared beam, a total of 32 time-resolved interferograms were collected.19 The 
synchronous and asynchronous 2D correlation analysis with a variety of infrared polarization angles 
were calculated based upon an algorithm developed by Noda,13 which was implemented in software 
named 2Dshige composed by S. Morita.20 
3. Theoretical Considerations 
3.1 Absorbance profiles of Polarized IR spectra 
To describe the arrangement of a molecular fragment, two important parameters including the 
orientation and alignment are generally introduced. These two parameters can be deduced from the 
absorbance profile  which is obtained from the polarized IR spectra. For a normal incidence 
on the cell substrate, the integrated infrared absorbance by an atomic group p can be expressed as

4.2 Polarized FTIR spectra in the K phase and SmC* phase 
 The determination of the molecular arrangement in the various phases of a SSFLC cell is 
important for the advance understanding of the temperatu
conformation and distribution. The polarized FTIR spectra of CMHCB in the K phase (at 65°C) and 
SmC* phase (at 108°C) were measured in the field-free state. Some major peaks are selected to 
analyze the azimuthal absorbance profiles in these two phases. To investigate the correlated 
variations of the functional groups, the 2D correlation analysis is performed on the resulting 
polarized spectra.

cm-1 and (d) 1490–1640 cm-1 region. 
 4.2 Time-resolved 2D IR correlation analysis 
The switching dynamics of CMHCB in SmC* phase can be better understood by monitoring 
the field-induced reorientation of different molecular segments with trFTIR. Bipolar square-wave 
pulses employed to excite the cell is describes in section 2. The time-resolved infrared absorption 
spectra were taken as a function of infrared polarization angle. To gain more insight into the 
correlated motions of the functional groups, the resulting time-resolved polarization 
angle-dependent patterns of infrared absorption peaks are subject to 2D correlation analysis and the

time courses of the synchronous and the hetero asynchronous peaks are yielded. 
Figure 7(a) presents a comparison of the dichroic ratio (filled symbols) and the synchronous 
auto peak (open symbols) of th
LC core segments. However, minor differences betwe
 can also be detected. The deviations can be attributed to originate from the isotropic 
component of the film, which has an effect on the dichroic ratio but can not affect the synchronous 
auto peak. The comparison between the apparent angle and the hetero asynchronous auto-peak 
height of is shown in Fig. 7(b). Indeed a quite high correlation between the apparent angle and the 
hetero asynchronous auto peak height was observed, indicating that the variations of asynchronous 
auto peak height can be properly used to describe the dynamical reorientation behaviors of 
molecular segments. The results show that the C=C stretching modes at 160

polarized IR spectra of a ferroelectric liquid crystal CMHCB in the K phase and SmC* phase. Our 
2D correlation plots clearly reflect the exhibition of the thermal fluctuations in the azimuthal angle 
of the director about a tilt cone (Goldstone mode) in the SmC* phase. The temperature-induced 
re-arrangement is found to be dependent on the molecular fragments. A time-resolved 2D IR 
correlation technique was applied to investigate the correlated motions of molecular segments in an 
electro-optic switching ferroelectric liquid crystal CMHCB. We demonstrated that the 2D IR 
correlation technique possesses useful properties, which allow us to reveal clearly a field-induced 
collective reorientation of the molecular segments in the SSFLC. An asymmetry in the response of 
the surface stabilized FLC to positive and negative driving pulses was also revealed in the 2D IR
