Abstract 
 
Due to extensive internet development, 
large amount of data can be obtained which 
has led to the development of data mining 
techniques.  However, it cannot be denied 
that there are still many cases of which the 
data are rare.  Thus small sample data sets 
which can not satisfy the statistical 
assumption, yet causes huge socio-economic 
cost have drawn attention to the researchers. 
There are two sources which cause 
insufficient data: one is due to high cost or 
short time for conducting proper sampling, 
such as DNA sequence or short life-cycle 
production plan. The other is called Rare 
Events of which the occurrence of the events 
is relatively few along the time horizon, such 
as nuclear plants explosion or tsunami 
attacks which happened statistically few, yet 
result in incredible lost in many ways. How 
to analyze such data so that their patterns can 
be revealed and predicted is what we 
concerned. Based on Possibility Theory, we 
have developed an effective data construction 
method, namely DCM, to analyze continuous 
data with promising results. However, we 
have realized that most of socio-economic 
data are discrete.  Therefore, how to develop 
a method to cope with rare discrete data is 
what we meant to investigate within two 
years of this project.  
So the main task of the first year’s study 
has focused on literature review and 
comparative studies. The results have 
provided a good base for the 2
nd
 year’s 
investigation which was to develop an 
 4 
estimating the underlying pattern. Hence, 
Section 2.1 reviews a number of important 
techniques for the generation of virtual 
samples and indicates their pros and cons. 
We then apply the special Triangular Fuzzy 
Number to describe the possibility 
distribution of a discrete datum. The ideas 
and properties of Triangular Fuzzy Number 
will all be interpreted in Section 2.2. Finally, 
summaries and discussions are presented in 
Section 2.3.  
 
2.1 Methods of Virtual Sample Generation 
 
Few closely related studies on small 
samples are found in the literature. One of 
the methods for virtual sample generation 
employs data expansion techniques to obtain 
more information from the given small data 
sets, called Mega-Trend-Diffusion [8]. This 
approach employs the diffusion process to 
cover the whole data set on a 
group-consideration basis instead of diffusing 
each datum directly. Following this technique, 
a set of artificial samples is trained by a 
Diffusion Neural Network (DNN), proposed 
by Li et al. [10], to extract knowledge for 
function learning. In practical application, Li 
et al. [11] employed Mega-trend-diffusion to 
reduce the prediction error in gene diagnosis 
for bladder cancer on a very limited number 
of samples. The study revealed that the 
testing accuracy increased steadily from 
81.67% to 100% when the training data sets 
were increased from 5 to 17. However, DNN 
requires twice as many input factors as the 
original ones in Mega-trend-diffusion, 
thereby resulting in considerably more 
complex calculations. 
Another method of generating a virtual 
sample is re-sampling. In re-sampling, the 
additional sample could be all possible 
combinations within the given data. A 
well-known re-sampling method is called 
Bootstrap. The Bootstrap or Bootstrapping 
method invented by Efron [5] suggests that 
one available sample gives rise to many 
others by re-sampling. This process can be 
implemented by constructing a number 
of additional samples of the given data, each 
obtained by random sampling from the 
original data. Bootstrap may also be 
employed in constructing hypothesis tests 
and confidence intervals for estimation. A 
number of studies have used the 
bootstrap-based confidence interval in 
estimation with small samples [6]. Others 
have shown that using the re-samples as a 
training data set can significantly improve the 
prediction accuracy of neural network 
learning [20]. However, given its re-sampling 
nature from the original data set, the 
correlation among the data tends to be high 
and against the independent and identically 
distributed (i.i.d.) condition. Chen et al. [3] 
claimed that the sample size of Bootstrap 
should be at least 12 or 15 to ensure stable 
results, which means that it cannot ensure 
applicability of the bootstrap technique with 
a very small sample size. 
The final approach called the Data 
Construction Method (DCM) which was 
proposed by Wang and Huang [17] is an 
entirely different approach. This method not 
only fills the gaps among small sample data 
successfully, but also presents the original 
data pattern properly. Such a process of data 
construction is inspired by the multiset 
division process [1], which aims to describe 
the duplicated values and generate additional 
data within the domain of the given data 
based on the Possibility Theory. DCM has 
been shown to be applicable to either 
one-dimensional data (1-DCM method) or 
multi-dimensional data (m-DCM method) 
[19]. 1-DCM is applied when each given 
datum is described by one attribute, or 
variable, as a scalar; whereas m-DCM is used 
 6 
membership value 1 is at mx  . As Fig. 1 
shows, the upper bound is m , whereas the 
lower bound is m .

2.3 Summary and Discussion 
 
In this Section, we reviewed a number of 
techniques for the generation of virtual 
samples, including Mega-trend-diffusion, 
Bootstrap, and DCM. Certain basic principles 
of the Fuzzy Set Theory that are related to the 
proposed approach were also illustrated.  
In summary, from the literature above we 
may highlight the observations as follows. 
First, when the population is ill-defined or 
the sample size is insufficient to conform to 
parametric assumptions, the non-parametric 
method is a good alternative. Second, certain 
shortcomings remain evident when using 
non-parametric approaches. For example, a 
sample size of at least 12 or 15 is necessary 
to ensure stable results since sample size has 
a major effect on bootstrapping. Third, the 
unbounded property on the domain value of 
virtual sample generation may significantly 
affect performance. To ensure the accuracy of 
the results, virtual samples within the domain 
range of the given data are crucial. In 
conclusion, DCM has been proven as the 
most effective approach for solving small 
sample sets, even those as small as 10n . 
However, it is only applicable for continuous 
small samples and for estimating density 
functions. In this study, we aim to address 
this need by investigating how to resolve 
discrete small sample problems through the 
adoption of the concept of DCM.  
 
 
3. Fuzzy Data Construction Method 
(Fuzzy DCM) 
 
In this section, we propose a new approach 
for filling up the information gaps that result 
from a discrete small sample set. Based on 
the DCM [17], we develop a fuzzy multiset 
division to generate discrete virtual samples 
with degrees of belonging to the domain of 
the given sample. Due to the lack of 
information, the most ignorant form of fuzzy 
numbers, Triangular Fuzzy Numbers, is 
adopted to transform the non-discrete data 
into discrete data with the degrees of 
belonging defined by the Extension Principle 
[21]. The proposed method is so called the 
Fuzzy Data Construction Method (Fuzzy 
DCM).  
 
3.1 Preliminary Concept and Definitions 
 
In Section 3.1.1, we introduce a few 
important concepts concerning data 
generation in continuous space. The criterion 
for the division set and a method to transform 
continuous data into discrete samples are 
then presented in Sections 3.1.2 and 3.1.3, 
respectively. Two issues concerning the 
sample generation procedure, namely, 
determining the size of the division set and 
the stopping rule, are discussed in Sections 
3.1.4 and 3.1.5, respectively. 
 
3.1.1 Fuzzy Data Generation in Continuous 
Space 
 
If any event may occur more than once in 
the real world, the duplicated values would 
determine the frequency of the event’s 
appearance when collecting the data. Such a 
concept can be presented by: 
Definition 3. [1] A multiset, ),( mAL o , in set 
theory, is defined by a set of ordered pairs as:

where 
o
A  is a set, while m  is a function 
 8 
integers, a common divisor is a positive 
integer that divides the numbers without a 
remainder. In the following, given the 
cardinality of a multiset divisor of A
~
, 
denoted by m , where m  does not exceed 
the number of all the divisors of A
~
. We shall 
construct a multiset divisor 
m

 such 
that the resultant multiset mCA(:)

 would 
obtain the largest number of discrete data.

It can be noted that there are continuous 
data being generated, which are considered as 
partially belonging to the desired discrete 
data set. Therefore, we develop a method to 
measure these generated data’s degrees of 
belonging to the discrete set in Section 3.1.3.  
 
3.1.3 Data Type Transformation 
 
In this section, we explain how to convert 
the previously generated samples in 
continuous form into discrete form. Multiple 
methods can be used to convert non-discrete 
data into discrete data, among which, the 
ceiling and floor functions are the most 
commonly used form. However, if we take a 
simple example of a non-discrete datum, 1.7, 
to be translated into   27.1   or   17.1  , it 
can be observed that these two translation 
functions treat numbers between 1.5＋ to 2 
as equal to the value of 2 and numbers from 
 10 
 
After the introduction of the basic concept 
of data generation, the issue of determining 
the number of divisors, say m , remains. This 
issue is induced by Property 1 below. From 
the division model defined by (15), Property 
1 provides a measure for estimating the 
amount of data being generated by Fuzzy 
DCM:

3.1.3. Then,

From this property, we can see that both 
the values and amounts of the divisor set mC  
affect the quality and quantity of the 
generated data. Based on the chosen rule of 
divisor in (13), the difference between the 
given and generated frequency distributions 
provides a tool for the determination of the 
division size m  based on the error rate 
defined below in (22). As the size of set mC  
increases, error rate decreases until it shows 
signs of overtraining by the increased value.

Given that the quality and quantity of the 
chosen divisors affect the results of 
generation, this index may not be generally 
stable. However, if a rapid generation 
procedure is required, 
m
E  can be used to 
determine the number of divisors. Apart from 
Equation (22), without losing generality, one 
divisor apart from the constant 1 should be 
selected. Once the number of divisors is 
determined, data generation procedure begins 
until the following stopping rule is satisfied:    
 
3.1.5 Stopping Rule 
 
Given that the purpose of Fuzzy DCM is to 
generate a sufficient number of virtual 
samples for analysis during the division 
process, whether |
~
| t
m
Z  is statistically 
sufficient must be determined; that is, how 
large t  should be. Chebyshev’s Inequality 
[13] provides a criterion that the amounts of 
required data fall in the range of the mean 
within multiples of its standard deviation. If 
the values of   and 2  are unknown, 
Wang and Huang [19] suggested the use of 
the sample mean x  and sample variance 2s  
with size n  as follows: 
)()]1)(1[(1)( 212 nknknksxxP   (23) 
Given that the generated data partially 
belong to a set with a degree of  , the 
stopping criterion of the Fuzzy Multiset 
Division procedure should be further 
modified. Following Equation (23), for any 
1k , when the probability is greater than or 
equal to the lower bound of w , division 
stops, and the number of divisions is 
determined as follows: 
 12 
original data remains. Moreover, the ratio of 
the size of the Fuzzy DCM data to the 
amount of the given sample will keep 
increasing while the number of multiset 
divisions increases. Therefore, Fuzzy DCM 
could conserve the original data regardless of 
the number of multiset divisions.

data will always be bounded by the domain

conducted. As mentioned in Section 2, the

3.4 Summary and Discussion 
 
Considering a set of discrete small samples, 
this study aims to develop a method for the 
generation of significant data to fill 
information gaps. In Section 3.1, fuzzy 
multiset division and the process of 
translation for the generation of virtual data 
were defined. The procedure and properties 
of the proposed approach are presented in 
Sections 3.2 and 3.3, respectively. In 
summary, this approach can be used to 
generate sufficient amounts of additional 
discrete data within the domain of the 
original sample to estimate the underlying 
pattern.  
To demonstrate the effectiveness and the 
procedures of Fuzzy DCM, it will be applied 
in a numerical illustration in Section 4. A 
discussion will also be presented, and 
concluding remarks will be given. 
 
4. Numerical Illustration 
 
In this section, a case regarding the 
university enrollment will be given as a 
numerical example to illustrate the proposed 
method. The case will be first described in 
Section 4.1. In Section 4.2, the Fuzzy DCM 
will be performed. The discussion and the 
concluding remarks will be presented in 
Section 4.3.  
 
4.1 Description of the Case 
 
 Universities should make reasonably 
accurate estimates of future enrollments 
because numerous decisions will be made 
based on such data. Studies have focused on 
this issue in recent years. Weiler utilized 
growth curve modes to forecast enrollments 
for a short period [16]. His results show that 
the forecasting error ranges from 2.4% to 
16% and have an average error of 9.7%. 
Chatman applied the regression method for 
forecasting the accumulated number of 
accepted students [2]. Song and Chissom 
used a fuzzy time series model to forecast

the steps of translation are shown 
from 5.1 to 5.4.

bounds of the non-discrete datum 1.5 
as 31)5.1(floor tql and

Then, the left and right spreads from

respectively.  
Step 5.2: Defining the membership

5.1  as 1, and that of the left limit

Multiset division is repeated as shown 
in Table 1. If the rapid generation 
procedure is not required, we proceed 
to Step 3. After two division 
iterations, 2t , the stopping rule is 
met. Therefore, the division 
procedure stops, and 22
~
Z  is obtained.  
 
(Table 1. The Results of the Illustrative 
Example by Fuzzy DCM)  
 
Step 7: Let 2T . The domain values of '2

~
Z  
are translated back with 1990. The 
results from standard Fuzzy DCM are 
shown in Fig. 6. 
Step 8: If the rapid generation procedure is 
required, this step must be performed. 
Based on Equation (22), the error rate 
can be calculated as %8.522 E . 
Step 9: Given that %8.52%100
21
 EE , we 
set 0t , 31 mm  and then 
proceed to Step 3. The rapid 
generation procedure stops at 4E  
because %0.48%8.52 32  EE  and 
%1.52%0.48
43
 EE . We then set 
314 m  and proceed to Step 3. 
 
After applying fuzzy multiset division 
(Step 4) and transforming non-discrete data 
into discrete data (Step 5), the stopping rule 
was verified (Step 6). Since the stopping 
criterion was satisfied at 1t , the resultant 
of the Fuzzy DCM data (Step 7) when 
3

In conclusion, Fuzzy DCM is an intuitive and 
efficient approach compared with methods 
from past research in terms of addressing 
discrete small sample problems.  
 
5. Conclusion and Future Study 
 
Given that markets rapidly change, data do 
not often meet the requirements of building a 
management model. Moreover, some rare 
events that infrequently occur in the real 
world can cause great losses in terms of 
human lives and properties. The data types of 
these events, along with the serious losses 
and high socioeconomic cost, are mostly 
discrete. Consequently, filling information 
gaps and generating virtual samples from 
insufficient data is a critical issue. 
This study proposed a new approach called 
Fuzzy Data Construction Method (Fuzzy 
DCM), which combines the DCM with the 
Fuzzy Set Theory. Fuzzy DCM is used to 
generate additional discrete data within the 
domain value of the given sample to 
subsequently reveal the data’s pattern.            
The concept of Fuzzy DCM and some 
insight on its properties were presented in 
Section 3. It shows that this approach can be 
used to generate sufficient amounts of 
additional discrete data within the domain of 
the original sample. Then, a discrete small 
sample problem of 27 college enrollments 
from 1972 to 1991 was then considered using 
Fuzzy DCM data, and the procedure and 
efficiency of the method were demonstrated 
in Section 4. The observed trend of the

一、參加會議經過 
此兩年一次的國際會議今年在波羅的海三小國之一的立陶宛之首都維爾紐斯召開‧由於地處偏
遠、故班機有限、以致無法安排轉接飛機﹑而必須在芬蘭的赫爾辛基轉搭水路至塔林、再以陸路至目
的地‧真是舟車勞頓‧所幸事前經旅行社安排好方能及時趕到‧ 
此會是歐陸規模有關作業研究最大的會議‧自台灣與會者有 53篇‧乃由作業研究學會統籌以「多目標
規劃」為主題組成 8 組參加‧規模相當龐大‧也讓主辦國及與會學者印象深刻‧ 
本人乃因應 Prof. 之邀故歸在「Inventory, Pricing, and Customer Behavior」組下與其他二位分
別進行報告‧無獨有偶 我們多以競局論為基礎討論不同產品特性下之定價問題‧由於議題熟悉、故討
論熱烈‧彼此建議、收穫豐富‧ 
本人所提出者乃近十年，在 3C 產品的市場，因為高科技的快速發展，縮短產品推出的時間。加上
近幾年環境的嚴重惡化，使人們的環保意識高漲，歐盟更是提出三大環保指令 WEEE、RoHS 及 Eup，
因此短生命週期綠色產品的定價策略成為目前重要的研究議題。 
本研究是在市場規模為已知時，針對兩家製造商所生產不同綠色程度的產品在一家零售商，或者
是同種綠色產品在兩家零售商，提供一組最佳的價格策略，使得零售商獲得最大利潤。基於多期定價
