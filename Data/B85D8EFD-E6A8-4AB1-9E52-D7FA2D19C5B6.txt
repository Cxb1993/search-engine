as templates to align the aniline monomers and to promote more ordered para-directed 
polymerization, consequently improving the solubility of PANI for further processing [25-28]. 
Others have reported to use poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), an acid polyelectrolyte, as template for 
chemical and enzymatic polymerization of aniline [9,29]. Recently, we have interestingly found 
that the electrochemical synthesized PANI film in the presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA) had 
stable microstructure, therefore the constructed PANI/Pt electrode exhibited enhanced sensitivity 
and excellent stability. In particular, the lysine-rich BSA provided PANI with plenty of primary 
amino groups for further modifications with biomolecules, such as proteins [30]. 
In this study, we employed uncoiled BSA as the template for the enzymatic polymerization of 
aniline. We also investigated the effect of SDS, an anionic surfactant, on the polymerization in the 
presence of BSA. The optimum condition for synthesis of conductive PANI was established, and its 
structure and electrochemical properties were characterized. 
 
2. Experimental 
2.1. Chemicals 
Hydrogen peroxide (35%, v/v), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and aniline monomer were 
obtained from Merck (KGaA Darmstadt, Germany). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and bovine 
serum albumin (BSA), as well as Graphite powder and paraffin oil, were purchased from Sigma-
Aldrich Corp. (St. Louis, USA). All other reagents that used for preparing buffers and standard 
solutions were purchased from various commercial sources and were of analytical grade. 1-Step™ 
ABTS for HRP activity was purchased from PIERCE Chemical Co. (Rockford, IL, USA) and was 
performed according to manufactory’s procedure. 
 
2.2. Polymerization 
Chemical synthesis of polyaniline is usually conducted under strong acidic condition with pH 
below 1 in order to produce conductive form of PANI [12,31], however, pH below 3 leaded to the 
dramatic decreasing of HRP activity (data not shown). Our preliminary results indicated that the 
citrate buffer with pH 4 was preferable for better HRP activity, which is normally recommended for 
enzymatic polymerization of aniline [32]. Before polymerization reaction, BSA (MW: 67 kDa) was 
denatured in boiling water for 5 minutes in the presence of SDS. The BSA:SDS mixture was then 
mixed with aniline solution by vigorous agitation. To process the polymerization, a certain amount 
of HRP was added with gentle mixing. H2O2, served as a mild oxidant agent to trigger the 
enzymatic polymerization of aniline, wan then added dropwisely with a three minutes time interval 
until complete in order to eliminate its effect on HRP activity. The polymerization processed for 
another four hours and PANI product was collected by centrifugation. The pellet was washed with 
distilled water and PANI powder was obtained by lypholization for about 12 hours. Alternatively, 
PANI was de-doped with 10 ml of 1 M NH4OH followed by being doped with 10 ml of 1M HCl 
before lypholization. The dark green PANI powder was then subjected to various characterizations. 
The morphology of PANI powder was visualized by an ABT-150S SEM (TOPCON Corp., 
Tokyo, Japan). A Q50 TGA instrument (TA Instruments Inc., Delaware, USA) under the nitrogen 
atmosphere with a heating rate of 10oC/min was employed to characterize the thermal 
decomposition of various PANI pellets and their protein contents. The composition and chemical 
structure of PANI were evaluated by a DA 8.3 FTIR spectrophotometer (Bomem Inc., Québec City, 
Canada) and a Genesys 2 UV-vis spectrophotometer (Rochester, NY, USA).   
 
2.3. Fabrication of the CPE and PANI-CPE electrodes 
      Carbon paste electrode (CPE) was prepared by mixing paraffin oil with graphite powder. The 
paste was further blended by an agitate mortar and packed into a plastic holder. To fabricate a CPE 
electrode, a platinum wire was buried into the packed paste. On the other hand, the PANI-CPE 
electrode was prepared by mixing certain weight ratio of graphite power and doped PANI power 
with paraffin oil. A portion of CPE was then replaced by the PANI-CPE paste. The electrochemical 
characterization was proformed in a miniature electrochemical cell by using the constructed CPE or 
PANI-CPE electrode as the working electrode, a platinum wire as the auxiliary electrode, and a

may fully extend the linear structure of BSA and grant BSA template with abundant negative 
charges that are able to recruit positive aniline monomers under pH 4. Furthermore, the BSA as an 
inert protein is normally employed in biochemical reactions to stabilize enzyme activity. In our case, 
the uncoiled lysine-rich BSA is able to attract SDS and prevent it from binding to HRP, therefore, 
may preserve the activity of HRP in the presence of SDS. As shown in Fig. 2B, increasing the 
molar ratio of BSA:SDS may effectively retain more activity of HRP, in which the activity of HRP 
is almost intact in the presence of 1.8 mM SDS while it is premixed with 0.6 mg/ml of BSA.

3.3. The influences of SDS and BSA on the polymerization of aniline 
Far below the CMC, SDS is unable to execute as a suitable template as SDS micelles, but it may 
still contribute its properties as a surfactant to the polymerization of aniline. It is interestingly 
noticed that the addition of BSA in the presence of SDS leads to synthesize the PANI with the 
appearance of dark green color and the yield of PANI is dramatically increased. The spectra in Fig. 
3 exhibits the increasing of bands nears 750 nm and 330 nm that are corresponding to the quinoid 
excitonic transition and π-π* transition of the conjugated aromatic rings, respectively [36], in which 
are also the signature pattern of the conductive emeraldine form of PANI [32,37]. The synthesized 
PANI is fully dissolved in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) and partially dissolved in tetrahydrofuran 
and methanol.

3.6. Characterizations of PANI by TGA 
Curve (c) in Fig. 6 exhibits the typical three-stage thermal decomposition of chemical 
synthesized PANI without template, including loss of water moisture and volatiles below 100oC, 
elimination of small molecules such as solvents and low molecular oligomers near 200oC, and 
followed by thermal decomposition of PANI backbone between 450oC and 600oC. Meanwhile, 
BSA alone has two stages of weight loss, which are loss of water moisture below 100oC and protein 
decomposition starting from 200 oC to 500oC (curve (d) in Fig. 6). On the other hand, the PANI 
synthesized in the presence of BSA and SDS displays the combined thermal decomposition patterns 
as shown by curves (a) and (b) in Fig. 6, whereas PANI of curve (a) has undergone the 
dedoping/doping procedure and curve (b) has not. In comparison with curve (c), the weight loss is 
accelerated dramatically within the temperature from 200 oC to 500oC, which is probably attributed 
to the extra decomposition of embedded BSA. In addition, curve (a) shows less weight loss than 
that of curve (b) between 200 oC to 500oC, implicating that the dedoping/doping with NH4OH and 
HCl is able to release majority of embedded BSA by disrupting its interaction with PANI.

(purple color), which is due to the incomplete extension of BSA molecule under the mild reaction 
environment. However, it is interestingly noticed that the addition of SDS results in the synthesis of 
emeraldine form PANI (dark green), whereas SDS functions as a denature agent to maintain the 
fully extended BSA molecule that becomes an ideal template for the aniline polymerization. The 
UV-vis and FTIR spectra all indicate the ordered para-directed polymerization as shown in Figs 3 
and 4. Both FTIR and TGA investigations have suggested that the BSA is entangled with 
synthesized PANI, but can be removed during the dedoping/doping procedure (Figs 4 and 6). 
Finally, the cyclic voltammetry analysis has demonstrated the doped PANI possesses an excellent 
electrochemical property (Fig. 7). In order to further improve the electrochemical properties and the 
solubility of PANI, various proteins with different molecular mass and amino acid compositions 
will be examined.

in the presence of SDS. The order of adding aniline, HRP, and H2O2 was numbered as 
indicated.
