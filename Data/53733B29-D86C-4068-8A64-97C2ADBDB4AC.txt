Abstract 
 
In this project, a semi-analytical approach is proposed to solve the scattering problem of flexural 
waves and dynamic moment concentration factor (DMCF) in an infinite thin plate with multiple 
circular holes by using the null-field integral formulation in conjunction with degenerate kernels and 
Fourier series. In the proposed approach, all the kernels in the direct formulation are expanded into 
degenerate forms. The scattering problem can be solved by decomposing it into two parts: incident 
wave field and radiation field. The radiation field is solved by using the proposed method and then 
the total field is obtained by adding it with the incident wave field. The results of dynamic moment 
concentration factors for the plate with one hole are compared with the available analytical solution 
to verify the validity of the proposed method. For the cases of small wave number, the quasi-static 
results of a plate with one or multiple circular holes are compared with the static data of finite 
element method (FEM) using ABAQUS. The numerical convergence analysis shows that the 
required number of terms for the Fourier series depends on both the incident wave number and 
central distance between holes. As the incident wave number increases, the DMCF distributions 
along the hole become dramatically fluctuated. In addition, a regular variation of DMCF versus 
central distance between holes can be found and its period depends on the incident angle and wave 
number. Finally, the analysis of ineffective distance shows that its value increases as the central 
distance increases and then a peak value will appears.

is devoted to solving the multiple scattering of flexural wave and dynamic stress concentrations in 
plate with multiple circular holes.  
It is noted that improper integrals on the boundary should be handled particularly when the BEM 
or BIEM is used. In the past, many researchers proposed several regularization techniques to deal 
with the singularity and hypersingularity. The determination of the Cauchy principal value (CPV) 
and the Hadamard principal value (HPV) in the singular and hypersingular integrals are critical 
issues in BEM/BIEM (Chen and Hong, 1999; Tanaka et al., 1994). For the plate problem, it is more 
difficult to calculate the principal values since the kernels are involved with transcendental functions 
and their higher-order gradients. Readers can consult with the review article by Beskos (1997). In 
this paper, instead of using the previous concepts, the kernel function is recast into the degenerate 
kernel which is expanded into a series form on each side (interior and exterior) of the boundary by 
employing the addition theorem since the double layer potential is discontinuous across the boundary. 
In reality, addition theorems are expansion formulae for the special functions (e.g. Bessel function, 
spherical harmonics, etc.) in a selected coordinate system (Gradshteyn and Ryzhik, 1996). Therefore, 
degenerate kernel, namely separable kernel, is a vital tool to study the perforated plate. Based on the 
direct boundary integral formulation, Chen et al. (2006a,b) recently proposed null-field integral 
equations in conjunction with degenerate kernels and Fourier series to solve boundary value 
problems with circular boundaries. By introducing the degenerate (separable) kernel, BIE involves 
nothing more than the linear algebra. Some applications were done in the static stress calculations of 
anti-plane (Chen et al., 2006a) and plate problems (Chen et al., 2006b). The introduction of 
degenerate kernel in companion with Fourier series was proved to yield the exponential convergence 
(Kress, 1989) instead of the linear algebraic convergence in BEM.  
This paper presents a semi-analytical approach to solve scattering of flexural waves and dynamic 
moment concentration factors in a thin plate with multiple circular holes. A linear algebraic system 
will be constructed by taking finite terms of Fourier series after uniformly collocating points on the 
boundary. After determining the Fourier coefficients of unknown boundary density, the displacement 
and corresponding section force produced by the incident flexural wave are determined by using the 
boundary integral equations for the domain point. For the plate problem, the slope (bending angle) 
and moment in the normal and tangential directions for the multiply-connected domain problem are 
determined with care under the adaptive observer system. Therefore, the operator of transformation 
matrix for the slope and moment is adopted to deal with this problem. Finally, the obtained result for 
an infinite plate with one circular hole is compared with the analytical solution (Kung, 1964) to 
verify the validity of the present method. For the cases of small wave number, the results for more 
than one hole will be compared with those of FEM using ABAQUS (2004) to demonstrate the 
generality of the proposed method. Finally the effect of central distance between holes on dynamic 
moment concentration factors is also investigated by the proposed method.

Eqs.(2)-(5) can be expanded to degenerate kernels by separating the source and field points. The

the first-kind Bessel) in the fundamental solution, we have the complex-valued kernel,

in the null-field boundary integral equations can be obtained by applying the operators of 
Eqs.(11)-(13) to the degenerate ( , )U s x  kernel. The other degenerate kernels ( , )U s xθ , ( , )s xθΘ ,

where 0cu , cnu , snu , 0cθ , cnθ , snθ , 0cm , cnm , snm , 0cv , cnv  and snv  are the Fourier 
coefficients and M  is the truncated number of Fourier series terms. The number of terms M in the 
Fourier series for circular boundaries can be, in general, different for each boundary circle. For 
simplicity, we used the same number of Fourier terms for each circular boundary. By using 
degenerated kernels, Fourier series and orthogonal property, all the improper integrals in 
Eqs.(17)-(20) can be transformed to series sum and then be calculated easily, since the potential 
across the boundary can be described in each side by using the degenerate kernel with series form. 
Successful experiences on Laplace problems (Chen et al., 2006a), Helmholtz problems (Chen et al., 
2007) and biharmonic problems (Chen et al., 2006b) can be found.

5 Dynamic moment concentration factor and techniques for solving scattering 
problems  
Considering an infinite thin plate with multiple holes subject to incident flexural wave, the 
boundary conditions of the hole are free. For this scattering problem, it can be decomposed into two 
parts, (a) incident wave field and (b) radiation field, as shown in Fig. 5. For matching the boundary 
conditions, the radiation boundary condition in part (b) is obtained as the minus quantity of incident 
wave function, e.g. ;R I R Im m= − = −v v  for the free edge where the superscripts R and I denote 
radiation and incidence, respectively. By substituting the known radiation boundary conditions,

6 Numerical results and discussions 
Scattering problems of flexural wave in thin plate with multiple holes are solved and dynamic 
moment concentration factors (DMCFs) around the circular holes are determined by using the 
present method. For the cases of small wave number, the same plate problem is independently solved 
by using FEM (the ABAQUS software) for comparison. In all cases, the inner boundary is subject to 
the free boundary condition and the thickness of plate is 0.002m. The triangular general-purpose 
shell element, S3, of ABAQUS was used to model the plate problem. Although the thickness of the 
plate is 0.002 m, these elements do not suffer from transverse shear locking according to the 
theoretical manual of ABAQUS (2004). 
Case 1: An infinite plate with one hole (Pao and Mow, 1972; Kung, 1964; Norris and Vemula, 
1995; Gao et al., 2001; Gao et al., 2005) 
An infinite plate with one hole (radius a = 1m) subject to the incident flexural wave with 0 0φ =  
is considered as shown in Figure 6. Since the analytical solution of this problem is available, 
convergence analysis is firstly conducted. Figure 7 shows the DMCF on the circular boundary, 
at / 2π , versus the dimensionless wave number by using different number of terms of Fourier series. 
From the convergence analysis, the required number of terms to approach the analytical solution 
increase as the incident wave number becomes larger. Results of the present method match well with 
those of analytical solution when the number of terms of Fourier series amounts to M = 10. The 
convergence analysis indicates that results using Fourier series with M = 2 match well with the 
analytical solution when the wave number is 0.005. For the case of the higher wave number k = 3.0, 
more number of terms are required to the same extent of convergence, which shows the consistency 
with the results presented by Figure 7. 
In the limit of zero wave number (Pao and Mow, 1972; Kung, 1964) like k = 0.005, the excitation 
of incident wave is equivalent to the loading with static moment 0xxM M=  and 0yyM vM=  at the 
four sides of a plate. Accordingly, a 16m×16m plate with one hole subject to static bending moments, 
.xxM 1 0=  and .yyM 0 3=  at the four sides was considered. For this equivalent static case, 25567 
triangle elements were used to generate the FEM model and Figure 8(a) shows the result of the 
normalized tangential bending moment around the hole. By using the present method, the unknown 
boundary densities of the plate are expressed in terms of Fourier series and the numerical result of 
DMCF around the hole using Fourier series terms (M = 10) is shown in Figure 8(b). The analytical 
solution (Pao and Mow, 1972; Kung, 1964) is also shown in Figure 8(c) and good agreements are 
made after comparing with three different approaches, the present method, analytical solution and 
FEM. 
Figure 9 shows that the real and imaginary parts of DMCF on the circular boundary at / 2π  
versus the dimensionless wave number for various Poisson ratios by using the present method and 
the analytical solution (Pao and Mow, 1972; Kung, 1964). It indicates that both results match well 
and DMCF depends on the Poisson ratio of the plate as well as the incident wave number. For 
dimensionless wave number ka=3.0, the real and imaginary parts of DMCF along the circular 
boundary is shown in Figures 10, which agrees with the result reported in Gao et al. (2005). The 
value of DMCF is symmetrical to x-axis due to the incident wave with 0 0φ = . Table 1 lists dynamic 
moment concentration factors on the circular boundary ( / 2θ π= ) by using four approaches, dual 
 14
It indicates that the maximum DMCF is larger than that of one hole as shown in Figure (8) due to 
two close holes in this case. 
For the case of L = 4.0m, Figure 16 shows the DMCF on the upper circular boundary, at / 2π− , 
versus the dimensionless wave number by using different number of terms of Fourier series. Instead 
of peak appeared in Figure 14, the result of convergence is similar to that of the case with one hole 
shown in Figure 7 due to two holes separated apparently.  
For dimensionless incident wave number ka=0.2 with the central distance between two holes 
L=2.1a, Figure 17 shows the distribution of the amplitude of DMCF on the circular boundary, solid 
line for one hole and dash line for the upper one of two holes. The DMCF of two holes is apparently 
larger than that of one hole when two holes are close each other. 
Figure 18 shows the DMCF at the upper circular edge ( / 2π− ) versus the dimensionless central 
distance under different incident wave number, where the dot line denotes the result of one hole. It 
indicates that when the central distance between two holes gradually increases, the results for the 
case of two holes approach that of the case with one hole. For the case of k = 2.0, oscillation 
behavior of DMCF is observed as the central distance of two holes varies. It is not found for the 
cases with the small wave number such as ka=0.1, 0.2 and 0.5. Furthermore, we zoom in the data of 
ka=0.1 at upper right corner (in the range of 1.834 to 1.838 for 0/TM M ). Then, it is refound that 
oscillation behavior of DMCF with a period /2 kπ  versus L/a for all wave numbers appear, which 
was not found in Hu et al. (1998).  
7 Concluding remarks 
A semi-analytical approach to solve the scattering problem of flexural waves and to determine 
dynamic moment concentration factors in an infinite thin plate with multiple circular holes was 
proposed. The radiation field was determined by employing the null-field integral formulation, 
degenerate kernels, tensor transformation and Fourier series. All the improper integrals in the 
null-field integral formulation were avoided by using the degenerate kernels and were easily 
calculated through the series sum. For the general exterior case, the rotated degenerate kernels have 
been derived in the adaptive observer system. Once the Fourier coefficients of boundary densities 
have been determined, the flexural wave scattering field and dynamic moment concentrations can be 
obtained by using the boundary integral equations for domain points in conjunction with general 
rotated degenerate kernels. For an infinite plate with one hole, good agreement between the results of 
the present method and those of analytical solution is observed. For the cases of small wave number, 
the present results for a plate with one or multiple circular holes are well compared with the static 
case of finite element method (FEM) using ABAQUS. Convergence rate depends on two parameters 
of the incident wave number and the central distance between two holes. Numerical results indicate 
that the DMCF of two holes is apparently larger than that of one hole when two holes are close to 
each other. Fictitious frequency of external problem can be suppressed by using the more number of 
Fourier series terms. The effect of the central distance on DMCF has been studied by using the 
present method and indicates a regular variation of DMCF as the central distance of two holes 
increasing. As can be seen from the numerical results, the present method provides a semi-analytical 
solution for dynamic moment concentration factors in infinite thin plates with multiple circular holes 
subject to the incident flexural wave, since its analytical solution is not yet available.

For the internal plate eigenproblem, most research work has focused on the free vibration 
analysis of circular or annular plate [1,2]. However, only few studies have conducted the 
problem of plate with an eccentric hole [3] or multiple holes. Recently some researchers 
intended to extend annular plate to the plate with an eccentric hole. Cheng et al. [4] 
encountered difficulty and resorted to finite element method to implement the vibration 
analysis of annular-like plates due to the complicated expression for this kind of plate. Laura 
et al. [5] determined the natural frequencies of circular plate with an eccentric hole by using 
the Rayleigh-Ritz variational method where the coordinate function does not satisfy the 
natural boundary condition in the inner free edge. This approximate analytic solution can 
provide good results, but the accuracy of some results is insufficient after careful 
comparisons. 
For the external plate problem under the incident SH wave, Kung [6] studied dynamic 
stress concentrations resulting from the scattering of flexural waves on the thin plate with 
one circular hole and gave the calculations of moment and shear forces as a function of 
frequency. By using the flux conservation relation and optical theorem, Norris and Vemula [7] 
considered the scattering of flexural waves by circular inclusions with different plate 
properties and obtained numerical results. The complex variable function approach and 
conformal mapping technique were employed to solve diffraction problem of flexural waves 
by two cutouts [8] and dynamic concentration factors of plates with two circular holes were 
presented under various boundary conditions. Gao et al.[9] studied the scattering of flexural 
waves and calculated the dynamic stress concentration in the thin plate with the cutout by 
using the dual reciprocity boundary element method. From literature reviews stated 
previously, few papers except Hu et al. [8] have been published to date reporting the 
scattering of flexural wave in plate with more than one cutout. Furthermore, as Kobayashi 
and Nishimura [10] pointed out that the integral equation method seems to be most effective 
for two-dimensional steady-state flexural wave. 
Improper integrals on the boundary should be handled particularly when the BEM or 
BIEM is used. In the past, many researchers proposed several regularization techniques to 
deal with the singularity and hypersingularity. The determination of the Cauchy principal 
value (CPV) and the Hadamard principal value (HPV) in the singular and hypersingular 
integrals are critical issues in BEM/BIEM [11]. For the plate problem, it is more difficult to 
calculate the principal values since the kernels are involved with transcendental functions 
and their higher-order gradients. Instead of using the previous concepts, the kernel function 
is recast into the degenerate kernel which is expanded into a series form on each side 
(interior and exterior) of the boundary by employing the addition theorem. 
In this paper, the null-field integral equation is utilized to solve the plate problems with 
circular boundaries. The general rotated degenerate kernel for the kernel function and 
Fourier series for the boundary density are utilized in the null-field integral formulation. By

The null-field integral equations (i.e. Eqs.(2)-(5) with the left hand side equaling to zero) 
can be derived by collocating the field point outside the domain and further the collocation 
point can be in the real boundary if the degenerate kernel functions are employed. Since the 
four equations of Eqs.(2)-(5) in the plate formulation are provided, there are 6 ( 42C ) options 
for choosing any two equations to solve the problems.

Consider the circular plate containing H nonoverlapping circular holes centered at the 
position vector oj ( j =1, 2," ,L), (L= 1+ H and o1 is the position vector of the outer circular 
boundary for the internal plate problem; L= H for the external plate problem), as shown in 
Fig. 3 in which Rj denotes the radius of the jth circular region, jx is the collocation point and 
Bj is the boundary of the jth circular hole. By uniformly collocating the N (=2M+1) null field

6 Dynamic moment concentration factor and techniques for solving 
scattering problems  
For an infinite thin plate with multiple holes subject to incident flexural wave, the 
boundary conditions of the hole are free. For this scattering problem, it can be decomposed 
into two parts, (a) incident wave field and (b) radiation field, as shown in Fig. 5. For 
matching the boundary conditions, the radiation boundary condition in part (b) is obtained as 
the minus quantity of incident wave function, e.g. ;R I R Im m= − = −v v  for the free edge 
where the superscripts R and I denote radiation and incidence, respectively.  
An incident flexural wave is represented by 
0 0( cos( ) sin( ))( )
0
ik x yiu e φ φ+  (27)
where ( )0
iu is the amplitude of incident wave, k is the wave number and 0φ  is the incident 
angle. Under the polar coordinate, the bending moment and effective shear force induced by 
the incident wave can be determined by substituting Eq. (27) into Eqs.(9) and (10). By 
setting the amplitude of incident wave ( )0 1
iu = , the amplitude of moment produced by the 
incident wave is

multiple circular holes were determined in this paper. Null-field integral formulation in 
conjunction with degenerate kernels, tensor transformation and Fourier series are employed 
were employed to establish the algebraic system by using the orthogonal property. The direct 
searching approach is conducted to determine the natural frequency by using the singular 
value decomposition (SVD) technique. The spurious eigenvalue appeared by using BIEM 
formulation can be successful suppressed by using the SVD updating technique. Excellent 
agreement between the results of the present method and those of ABAQUS is observed. The 
scattering of flexural wave from circular holes can be decomposed into the radiation problem 
which can be solved by using our proposed method. The dynamic moment concentrations 
can be obtained by using the boundary integral equations for domain points in conjunction 
with general rotated degenerate kernels. For the cases of small wave number, the present 
results for a plate with three circular holes are well compared with the static case of finite 
element method (FEM) using ABAQUS. Numerical results indicate that fictitious frequency 
of external problem can be suppressed by using the more number of Fourier series terms. As 
can be seen from the numerical results, the present method provides a semi-analytical 
solution for the plate problem with multiple circular holes, since its analytical solution is not 
yet available.
