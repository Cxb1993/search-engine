which kind of metal loading we used. In Madrid, at 
ICP, a time-series Raman spectra has already been 
recorded, which can show the trend of cyclohexene 
declining and 1,2-epoxycyclohexane growing during 
reaction. We explored that V-Ti/MCM41 can be used as 
thermocatalyst and photocatalyst in different 
circumstances.

Objective 
The objective is to investigate the mechanism of photocatalysis by means of in situ spectroscopy 
methods, included NIR-Raman. The use of NIR-Raman would circumvent most of the problems posed 
by fluorescence to visible-Raman in situ studies and by water absorption to in situ IR studies. As a 
proof of concept, the reaction of epoxidation of cyclohexene was investigated on silica-supported 
photocatalysts, such as V-Ti/MCM41. The state of the catalyst and intermediate species were 
determined by in situ spectroscopy, and the role of peroxide intermediate species was assessed. 
 
 
 
 
 
Details of specific research output (2nd year) 
Both groups had the chance to interact during 2011 based on a bilateral travel support grant. Due to this 
travel support grant, we have made analyses in several months, aiming at interfacing photocatalysis 
expertise on NTU and in situ and operando Raman on ICP. In photocatalyst part, we reached higher 
conversion and selectivity by V-Ti/MCM41, which has larger surface area and mild-oxidation power. 
By the experiences in the first year, we know that the low signal response in Raman spectra is our 
major barrier. Therefore, we decided to aim at a reaction that may deliver better Raman signal. In order 
to enhance the signal response, we focused our experiments on cyclohexene epoxidation. There are 
numerous advantages for a liquid phase reaction such as higher signal response, easier reactor design, 
better temperature control, etc. Figure 1 shows the photo-Raman system. This system is different from 
the Raman instruments we used last year, the immersed Raman probe can highly enhance the signal 
responses and reduce the interferences of UV light.

In Madrid, at ICP, the exchange student, Mr. Hsiang-Yu Chan of NTU, found that the catalyst could be 
used as photocatalyst and thermocatalyst in different circumstances. With higher temperature, 80
o
C, the 
thermal driving force is high enough to activate the reaction. From the Raman spectra in Figure 3, we 
can easily distinguish product (1,2-epoxycyclohexane) and oxidant, tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP), 
then also calculate the selectivity and conversion. As shown in Figure 3(a), the reactant, cyclohexene, 
was consumed, while the product, 1,2-epoxycyclohexane, was increased after 6-hr thermal reaction. 
The oxidant was oversupplied so its intensity was only changed a little. In the in-situ Raman 
monitoring system, we can even record the spectra in each 10-minute interval and draw a series of 
spectra to show the trend of reactants and products as shown in Figure 3(b).

Ti/MCM41 respectively. The results of Raman spectra for both of them have shown in Figure 6(a) (b) . 
Raman spectra are used for an efficient real-time monitoring of reaction progress, conversion and 
selectivity. To do so, a chemometric approach was used so that reaction product is analyzed as a linear 
combination of the spectra of the reactants and possible products, delivering quantitative analyses of 
conversion and selectivity. In both cases, the additional advantage is that it is non-invasive, so that no 
sampling is required, only spectra acquisition during reaction.

From the results in Table 1, we observed that both of V, Ti containing materials can be active for the 
reaction. Once we use both of them as metal loading on MCM41, the conversion became even higher. 
However, it is hard to distinguish the mechanism of thermo-reaction and photoreaction from the results 
of these spectra. It is clear that much additional work is required before a complete understanding of 
this phenomenon occurs. In the end, we look forward that the study will stimulate further study in this 
field. A key outcome of this project is the proof of concept that it is possible to use Raman 
spectroscopy for real-time monitoring during photocatalytic activated reactions.

hydrogen‚Äìoxygen mixture or only molecular oxygen are very clean
and have shown good activity performance. However, the extra
energy lost in the reaction, low hydrogen efÔ¨Åciency and safety con-
sideration that requires H2O2 production facilities to be restricted
in size have made these approaches only a temporary solution.
It is well known that photo-energy is the Earth‚Äôs ultimate energy
source and friendly to environment. Following the excellent pio-
neer work of Fujishima and Honda in 1972 [9],  scientiÔ¨Åc and
engineering interests in TiO2, particularly in the Ô¨Åeld of photo-
catalysis, have grown signiÔ¨Åcantly [10‚Äì16].  However, there are only
few researches on photo-epoxidation in the presence of photocata-
lysts and their performances are not advanced yet [17‚Äì23].  In 2000,
Yoshida et al. investigated more than 50 types of silica-supported
metal oxides for their photo-oxidation activities and found that
TiOx/SiO2 was the most effective photocatalyst attaining 4.7% in PO
yield and 19.2% in PO selectivity under batch reaction with 200 W
Xe lamp irradiation and at 318 ¬± 5 K [18]. In 2006, Amano et al.
proposed V2O5 (0.1%)/SiO2 as the best photocatalyst until now,
which has demonstrated a PO formation rate of 85 mol  g cat‚àí1 h‚àí1
and a PO selectivity of 37% under continuous reaction at 303 K and
with UV-C light of 240 <  < 440 nm [19]. From economic and envi-
ronmental viewpoints, most of the current studies on epoxidation
require further improvements. Although there were two  new epox-
idation processes developed recently, a cumene‚Äìhydroperoxide
process (2003 in Japan) and a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) epoxi-
dation process (2008 in Belgium), they still based on multi-stage
liquid-phase reactions and required hydrogen. The photocatalytic
epoxidation of propylene is a promising process because it is envi-
ronmentally friendly, and the process can be carried out under mild
conditions in the absence of hydrogen; however, its performance
still needs to be improved.
It is expected that direct epoxidation process to produce PO
with the aid of light energy over photocatalysts will be a promising
approach for the production of chemicals in the future. Therefore,
the main strategy being considered in this study is to develop a
direct gas-phase one-pass reaction under mild conditions. Our aim
is to explore the selective photocatalytic epoxidation of propylene
via an ideal oxidant, i.e., molecular oxygen. The key is using photo-
energy to achieve high PO selectivity at mild conditions, as show in
Eq. (3).

The objective of this study is to evaluate the direct gas-phase
photocatalytic epoxidation on a series of photocatalysts such as
SiO2, TiO2, V-Ti/MCM-41, V2O5/SiO2, Au/TiO2 and TS-1 at mild
conditions. The optimal reaction conditions were also studied
for photocatalytic epoxidation by comparing the selectivities and
yields of PO for different photocatalysts. The mechanism of photo-
catalytic epoxidation was also proposed based on the knowledge
of species present during the photocatalytic reaction.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of photocatalysts
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) powder used in this study was  commer-
cial P25 (Degussa). The photo-deposition of Au particles on TiO2
was carried out by the method suggested in the literature [24].
HAuCl4 solution and TiO2 were mixed together and adjusted to
pH 5.5 by using 0.1 M Na2CO3 before illumination. The solution
was irradiated with a 200 W mercury‚Äìarc lamp for 120 min  with
stirring. The photocatalyst was Ô¨Åltered and washed before drying
in an oven at 393 K and calcined in a Ô¨Çow of air at 773 K for 5 h.
Amorphous SiO2 was prepared from tetraethyl orthosilicate
(TEOS, Aldrich, 98%) by using the sol‚Äìgel method. The pH of a mix-
ture containing ethanol, TEOS, and deionized water was adjusted
to approximately 2 by HCl (0.1 M)  solution and the mixture was
stirred for 2 h. After that, it was  dried in an oven at 393 K and cal-
cined in a Ô¨Çow of air at 973 K for 5 h to yield the amorphous SiO2
powder.
Titanium silicalite-1 (TS-1) was  prepared by the hydrothermal
crystallization of gel from tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS, Aldrich,
98%) and titanium (IV) tetrabutoxide (TBOT, Alfa Aesar, 98%) in
the presence of tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH, 20% in
water, Fluka) with a small amount of polyoxyethylene sorbitan
monolaurate (Tween 20), which was reported by Khomane et al.
[25]. The ratio of Si to Ti for TS-1 was 19:1 in this study.
V2O5 (0.5 wt%)/SiO2 was  prepared using the same method as
reported by Amano and Tanaka [26]. First, silicon(IV) oxide (99.5%;
Stream chemical) was stirred with an aqueous solution of NH4VO3
at 353 K for 2 h, followed by evaporation to dryness. Next, the sam-
ples were calcined in dry air at 773 K for 5 h.
Mesoporous V-Ti/MCM-41 molecular sieves were syn-
thesized by simple hydrothermal treatment method using
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as the structure-
directing template. The molar composition of the gel mixture was
SiO2:0.01TiO2:0.01V2O5:0.2CTAB:0.89H2SO4:120H2O. In a typical
synthesis procedure, 21.2 g of sodium metasilicate monohydrate
dissolved in 100 ml  DI water was combined with the appropriate
amount of metal precursors like titanium oxysulfate hydrate
and/or vanadyl sulfate hydrate (dissolved in 20 ml  of 2 M H2SO4)
for the titanium and vanadium sources, respectively. The resulting
mixture was stirred vigorously for 30 min. Then, approximately
20 ml of 2 M H2SO4 was added to the above mixture to adjust the
pH to 10.5 with constant stirring to form a uniform gel. After stir-
ring, the solution containing 7.28 g of CTAB dissolved in 25 ml  of DI
water was added slowly into the above mixture and the combined
mixture was stirred for three additional hours. The resulting gel
mixture was transferred into a TeÔ¨Çon coated autoclave and kept in
an oven at 145 ‚ó¶C for 36 h. After cooling to the room temperature,
the resulting solid was  recovered by Ô¨Åltration, washed with DI
water and dried in an oven at 110 ‚ó¶C for 8 h. Finally the organic
template was  removed by calcination at 550 ‚ó¶C for 10 h.
2.2. Characterization
The light absorption of photocatalysts was fully characterized
by reÔ¨Çective diffusive UV‚Äìvis spectroscopy (UV‚Äìvis DRS, Varian
Cary 100). BaSO4 was  used as a standard reÔ¨Çection reference. Scan-
ning electron microscopy (SEM) was  carried out on Nova Nano SEM
230 instrument. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was per-
formed on Hitachi H-7100 electron microscope instrument. Powder
X-ray diffraction (XRD, Xray-M03XHF, Ultima IV) was used for crys-
talline structure and calculation of photocatalyst sizes. All peak data
measured by XRD analysis were checked and assigned to known
crystalline phases by comparing with those of JCPDS database. The
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out to deter-
mine the chemical composition of the elements and the chemical
status of various species on the Thermo Theta Probe instrument.
The speciÔ¨Åc surface area of photocatalyst was  measured by Micro-
metrics, ASAP 2000. The atomic structure of V-Ti/MCM-41 and TS-1
was studied by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the National
Synchrotron Radiation Research Center in Hsin Chu, Taiwan. For Ti
K-edge and V K-edge spectra, they were analyzed in Ô¨Çuorescence
mode on beam-line 16A. The analysis was  performed using ARS
DE-202G Closed Cycle Cryostat with Lytle detector. The samples
were prepared as powder form, and dispersed on Kapton tape. The

3. Results and discussions
3.1. Photocatalyst characterization
The X-ray diffraction patterns of various photocatalysts are
shown in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the main diffraction peaks
of V-Ti/MCM-41 at 2 = 1.9‚ó¶ and 3.9‚ó¶ conÔ¨Årm the family of meso-
pore structure. The diffraction peaks of TS-1, at 2 = 23.2‚ó¶, 23.8‚ó¶,
24.3‚ó¶ and 45‚ó¶, are consistent with the MFI  topology structures as
shown in the inset of Fig. 2(a) [27]. The presence of single diffrac-
tive peaks at 2 = 24.3‚ó¶ in the XRD pattern indicates a change
from monoclinic symmetry (S-1) to orthorhombic symmetry (TS-1)
[28]. In Fig. 2(b), the photocatalysts containing TiO2 showed inten-
sive XRD peaks for anatase phase and rutile phase as expected in
P25. Au is highly dispersed on the TiO2 which exhibits a char-
acteristic XRD pattern with Ô¨Åne structures at 2 = 44.38‚ó¶, 64.56‚ó¶
and 77.55‚ó¶. No peak is shown for SiO2 due to their amorphous
structure.

V-Ti/MCM-41 and (c) V 2p: V2O5/SiO2, V-Ti/MCM-41.
Fig. 3 shows the UV‚Äìvis diffusive reÔ¨Çectance spectroscopy of dif-
ferent photocatalysts. There is a slight absorption edge at around
200‚Äì380 nm for amorphous SiO2 and V-Ti/MCM-41 as shown in the
inset of Fig. 3(a)‚Äì(b). The spectrum of TS-1 as shown in Fig. 3(c) is
widely used to conÔ¨Årm the electronic transitions between O2‚àí and
Ti4+ in a tetrahedral environment of isolated framework of Ti(IV)
centers. Moreover, the absence of absorption band at 320‚Äì400 nm
indicates that no anatase or extra framework of Ti is observed in
TS-1 [7].  For TiO2 (P25) shown in Fig. 3(d), the absorption edge is
observed at around 400 nm,  which is between the absorption edge
of anatase (387 nm)  and rutile (418 nm). For V2O5 (0.5 wt%)/SiO2

of element. The pre-edge peak shows the information of local
coordination structure [31]. Compared with the Ti(III) and Ti(IV),
the average oxidation state of titanium in V-Ti/MCM-41 and TS-1
should be Ti4+ from the shifts of absorption edges shown in Fig. 7(a)
and (b), respectively. From the pre-edge peaks of Fig. 7(a), the local
coordination structure of Ti4+ is suggested to be tetrahedral. As
shown in Fig. 7(b), the pre-edge peak of TS-1 fresh is higher than
that of TS-1 reacted. The local coordination structure of TS-1 fresh
is close to genuine tetrahedral while that of TS-1 reacted is slightly
distorted. This suggests that TS-1 is distorted due to Ti connecting
to propylene or other oxygenates during reaction.
3.2. Direct gas-phase photocatalytic epoxidation of propylene
Table 1 summarizes the results of photocatalytic epoxidation of
propylene with oxygen over a series of photocatalysts in a continu-
ous packed-bed reactor at mild conditions. The conversion rates
of propylene range from 4.5 to 619.5 mol  g cat‚àí1 h‚àí1 while PO
selectivity ranges from 1% to 46.8%. In addition to PO, other prod-
ucts, such as propionaldehyde, acetone, acetaldehyde, ethanol and
methanol were detected and their selectivities were calculated. The
most dramatic differences between two supported photocatalysts
(TiO2 and SiO2) are in the production of side products and the

conversion rate of C3H6. TiO2 support can convert more C3H6 to
total oxidation while SiO2 support leads to low oxidation at lower
C3H6 conversion.
The adsorption of propylene was observed for all photocatalysts
during photoreaction after switching on the UV light. Table 1 lists
the average adsorption rates based on the carbon balance in 4 h
reaction. The propylene adsorption is the combination of physical
and chemical adsorptions on the supports, which depends on sur-
face area and TiO2 content. The amount of propylene adsorbed on
V-Ti/MCM41 was substantial because of the mesoporous nature of
material.
Commercial TiO2 (entry 1) shows high photo-oxidation activ-
ity. The C3H6 consumption rate is 619.5 mol  g‚àí1 h‚àí1 with most
CO2 in the products, and no PO is observed. The size of Au particles
is very important on epoxidation. This study also conÔ¨Årms that the
Au particle with size higher than 5.0 nm prefers complete oxidation
of C3H6 to CO2 as shown in entry 2 [32]. A considerable amount of
CO2 is produced not only from the direct photo-oxidation of propy-
lene, but also from the successive photo-oxidation of oxygenated
products. Hence, only a few PO can be generated over Au/TiO2 and
TiO2.
The UV absorption of amorphous SiO2 is very low (Fig. 3), thus
very low C3H6 conversion rate was obtained as listed in entry 3 of
Table 1. However, the selectivity to form PO still can reach 10.6%.
The main reason may  be the high speciÔ¨Åc surface area of SiO2,
560.1 m2 g cat‚àí1. Therefore, SiO2 can harvest more photo-energy
in order to produce sufÔ¨Åcient electron‚Äìhole pairs on the photo-
catalyst and carry out partial oxidation successfully. The dispersed
vanadium oxide on silica had signiÔ¨Åcantly improved the light
absorption at around 200‚Äì550 nm (Fig. 3). As listed in entry 4 of
Table 1, PO still cannot be produced over V2O5/SiO2 although the
C3H6 conversion rate increased 5 times as compared with amor-
phous SiO2.
The most favorable photocatalytic epoxidation was  on TS-1
and V-Ti/MCM-41 under various reaction conditions as shown in
entry 5 and 6 of Table 1, respectively. These two photocatalysts

4. Conclusions
A direct photo epoxidation process to produce PO from propy-
lene by O2 with the aid of light energy over photocatalysts is a
promising technology for the production of chemicals in the near
future. Compared to other thermal processes of propylene epox-
idation, no hydrogen is required in the photocatalytic process.
Furthermore, sunlight may  be applied in the photo-epoxidation
in the future. In this study, under mild conditions, Ti-V/MCM-41
and TS-1 promote the photocatalytic epoxidation of propylene with
molecular oxygen at steady state in a Ô¨Çow reactor system. The high-
est PO formation rate and PO selectivity achieved on stream after 4 h
over Ti-V/MCM-41 is 114 mol  g cat‚àí1 h‚àí1 and 47%, respectively,
at 50 ‚ó¶C and atmospheric pressure. In summary, V-Ti/MCM-41 is
the most favorable photocatalyst for the photocatalytic epoxidation
in this study, and the selectivity of PO could be further enhanced
possibly by solving the pore restriction of reaction intermediate.

In order to significantly enhance the signal response of Raman, the UV light source is also important. The 
UV light source we used in Madrid is weak and unstable. Therefore, we brought a powerful UV lamp that 
we have operated all photoreaction in NTU and ICP in 2011. With the optical fiber guide, the UV light 
could be more precisely irradiate on the surface of the solution. The shipment of the UV lamp was not easy, 
but we still made it. Unfortunately, this device had some electronic malfunctions during those two months. 
Only limited the uptime we could use the UV irradiation on the photoreaction. However, we overcame 
with the situation by ourselves, and we believe we learn and acquire this precious experience.

Photocatalytic reactions are an important field in heterogeneous catalysis, which may overcome significant 
selectivity limitations in selective oxidation reactions, such as olefin epoxidation. There is a need to 
fundamentally understand photocatalysis because the reaction mechanism of photocatalysis and the actual 
state of the catalyst during reaction remain unclear. This requires a combined effort of complementary talents 
to foster fundamental understanding. Thus, the expertise on photocatalysis by NTU group and the expertise in 
spectroscopy during reaction on oxides by ICP group have combined to tackle this objective.  
 
In the second year, the goal is to monitor the photoreaction of a cyclohexene epoxidation and reveal the 
mechanism of photocatalysis by means of in situ spectroscopy methods, in particular NIR-Raman. The 
photo-epoxidation of cyclohexene was performed to explore its possibility by various photocatalysis and 
benchmark in NTU. The highest cyclohexene epoxide selectivity was found of 99% to use MCM41, no matter 
which kind of metal loading we used. In ICP, a time-series Raman spectra has already been recorded, which 
can show the trend of cyclohexene declining and cyclohexene epoxide growing during reaction. We explored 
that V-Ti/MCM41 can be used as thermocatalyst and photocatalyst in different reaction conditions. The detail 
results and discussion is in the final report.
