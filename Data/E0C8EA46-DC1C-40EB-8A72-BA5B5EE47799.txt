■ 計畫成果自評 
 
本計畫主持人發展二維數值黏性造波水槽，用以探討波浪與防波堤的互制情形。為逼近
真實流體，本模式求算非穩態雷諾平均方程式與紊流模式，並採用質點等位函數法模擬碎波
時複雜的自由液面變化情形，其準確性經數值測試，結果令人滿意。此外，應用本模式模擬
孤立波通過半無限長潛堤之數值結果與實驗室量測比對亦相當吻合。為釐清波浪碎波時能量
的損失，本計劃將有系統地探討波浪淺化、水體重合及飛濺過程中位能與動能之間的轉換關
係。數值結果顯示主要的能量損失起因於水體重合過程。此結果對於近岸淺水波浪與防波堤
間互制情形，提供更具體的碎波流場演變機制。感謝國科會於計畫期間的補助，使本論文得
以順利完成。

surface is identified using a specific function 
defined as the fractional volume ratio of the cell 
occupied by fluid.  The modified versions of VOF 
method have been widely used to track the 
interfaces between different fluids. [23], [2] and 
[10] applied the so-called first-order linear 
approach or the second-order linear curve to 
reconstruct the free surface. 
Recently, a novel technique presented by [20] 
was derived for computing the motion of 
two-phase flow which allows for large density 
ratios, surface tension, and jumps in viscosity.  A 
level set method [14] is proposed for capturing the 
interface between two fluids, and can be 
generalized to three-dimensional problems easily.  
This new treatment of the level set method 
provides another way to compute the interface 
separation and combination, such as the motion of 
air bubbles in water or falling water drops in air.  
However, numerical diffusion may arise during the 
time advancing.  Numerous researchers 
consecrated to modify the traditional level set 
method, such as [19], [16], [17] and [6] were 
attempted to develop a more accurate and 
efficiently solution algorism to reduce the 
computational effort. 
In present study, a numerical wave tank model 
was developed to simulate the propagating wave 
over a submerged shelf.  The unsteady, 
two-dimensional Reynolds Averaged Navier- 
Stokes (RANS) equations and the turbulence 
model ( ε−k  model) were solved for simulating 
the realistic fluid.  A hybrid particle level set 
method [6] was applied to capture the interface 
between the air and water phases.  A piston-type 
wavemaker was located at the upstream of the 
wave tank and generated the anticipative waves.

四、邊界條件 
For the solution of the RANS equations and 
the turbulent transport equations, it is necessary to 
provide appropriate boundary conditions at all 
boundaries of the solution domain, as well as the 
initial conditions at Ot =  in the whole domain.  
The boundary conditions that must be satisfied are: 
(1) the kinematic and the dynamic free surface 
boundary conditions at the interface Γ between air 
and water phase, (2) the upstream boundary 
condition on the wavemaker plate [5], (3) the fixed 
boundary condition including the boundary of rigid, 
impermeable breakwater and wave tank, where the 
velocities, turbulent kinetic energy and its 
dissipation rate are set to zero.  The initial 
conditions of the velocities, hydrodynamic 
pressure, surface displacement are set to zero at 
time Ot = . 
The kinematic condition mentioned above 
states that the free surface moves with the fluid 
particles.  This concept can be described in terms 
of the advection of the level set function as 
expressed in Section 3.  The dynamic conditions 
along the interface Γ are the continuity conditions.  
They can be expressed as following, respectively 
O
n
=∂
∂
Γ
ϕ ; atmPP =Γ  (21) 
where ϕ  indicates the mean velocity (U  or 
V ), turbulent kinetic energy ( k ) or dissipation rate 
of turbulent kinetic energy ( ε ), and n  is the 
direction normal to the interface Γ.  The 
continuity concept can be satisfied by solving 
following PDE to steady state [16]

where )(φS  is a smoothed sign function as 
expressed in Eq.(15);  τ  is the fictitious time and 
the operator ∇  denotes )/,/( yx ∂∂∂∂  
 
五、數值方法 
In this model the governing equations were 
discretized by means of a finite-analytical scheme 
[3].  The SIMPLER algorithm [15] was used to 
calculate the coupled velocity and pressure fields.  
The evolution of level set method was solved using 
forth-order TVD Runge-Kutta method [18] and 
fifth-order WENO scheme [9]. 
 
六、數值驗證 
To demonstrate the accuracy of the particle 
level set method used in this study, Zalesak’s 
problem of a rotating slotted disk [24] is solved.  
Numerical diffusion can be observed during the 
evolution of the level set function.  As plotted in 
Fig. 1, the radius and slot width of the slotted disk 
are 15 and 6, respectively.  The domain size in the 
numerical computation is 100 × 100 with a 
uniform grid size of 5.0ΔΔ == yx  and a constant 
time step of 25.0Δ =t .  The slotted disk is 
initially centered at (50,75) and rotates around a 
centre (50,50) with a constant angular velocity 
0.01.  Notably from Fig. 2 that the level set 
function has advanced quite well as compared with 
the original shape.  Besides, the contour 
distribution implied that the level set function 
re-distanced accurately as a signed distance 
function during time evolution.  Furthermore, 
combined the numerical results of the hybrid 
particle level set method with traditional level set 
method in the same figure, it revels that hybrid 
particle level set method had substantially 
overcome the numerical diffusion of traditional 
level set method, which dominates the 
conservation of mass.  Using such hybrid method, 
we could investigate complex phenomena of wave 
motion, such as wave breaking, overtopping etc., 
more precisely. 
To demonstrate the accuracy of present model 
for simulating the wave breakings, the numerical 
results of the wave profile on a shelf, from the 
incident stage to the breaking point, were 
compared with the experimental data  Figure 3 
shows a schematic diagram of the experimental 
setup performed by [22].  The still water oh  was 
set at m31.0 , the height of the shelf is m263.0 , 
and the incident solitary wave height was 
mHi 1314.0= .  Four wave gauges (P1 to P4) 
were distributed near the leading edge of the shelf 
to record the temporal water surface elevation.  
To reduce the computational time, the numerical 
wave flume was set up in a finite domain of 10.5 
meters long (about 5.0 times of the effective wave 
length) and 0.6 meter high (about 2.0 times of the 
still water depth) using 3500 × 200 uniform 
computation cells.  The upstream boundary 
condition was applied to generate the desired 
incident solitary wave coincident with that

the energy dissipation caused by the reattachment 
of the ejected jet.  Similarly, the rapid fall of the 
time rate of change of the kinetic energy indicates 
that the increase in the kinetic energy is retarded at 
the moment of reattachment.  Based on these 
facts, we may conclude that the reattachment is 
accompanied by a rapid fall in the time rate of 
change of the kinetic energy and the total energy.
