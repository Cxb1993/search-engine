unique active sites for self‐assembling of CNTs.  In this report, multi‐walled CNTs 
(MWCNTs) can be produced at 800 oC in the flow of C2H4/He on carbon black. 
 
Experimental Section 
 Carbon black‐BP2000 was supplied by China Synthesis Rubber Co. and did not 
proceed with any treatments. In the fabrication of carbon nanotubes on carbon black, 
the sample were heated to 800oC in He at a flow rate of 40 mL/min, and then 
switched to C2H4/He (3:1) at the same flow rate and maintained at 800
oC for 1 hour. 
    The microstructure of carbon nanotubes on carbon black surfaces were 
examined by scanning electron microscopy‐SEM (JEOL JSM 6400) and the chemical 
composition of carbon nanotubes was analyzed by Raman spectroscopy 
(JOBIN-YVON T64000).  Transmission electron microscopy‐TEM (JEOL TEM‐3010) 
was used to observe the high‐resolution images of carbon nanotubes 
 
Results and Discussions 
 Figure 1a and 1b reveal the SEM images of CNTs grown at 800oC in C2H4/He (3:1) 
for 1 h on carbon black surfaces.  In Figure 1 c and 1d, the lower magnification and 
the close‐up image of CNTs with outer diameters of 30‐70 nm synthesized on carbon 
black surface.    
Figure 2 are the HRTEM image of MWCNTs on carbon black surface and the Raman 
spectra of carbon black, CNTs grown on carbon black by synthesized at 800oC in 
C2H4/He (3:1) at a flow rate of 40 mL/min for 1 h..  The HRTEM image demonstrates 
clearly the 002 fringes (evidenced by XRD measurements, not shown here) in the 
wall with d002=0.342 nm. 
The HRTEM image indicates that the wall of the MWCNTs has a fairly good 
crystalinity fabricated on carbon black surface.  The Raman spectra are consistent 
with this result.  Before the synthesis of CNTs, the intensities of D‐band and G‐band 
of pure carbon blacks are nearly negligibly, when CNTs fabricated on carbon black 
surface, it is obvious to find a G‐band at 1590 cm‐1 and a D‐band at 1341 cm‐1, the 
Raman spectra shown MWCNTs fabricated by CVD method.     
     Carbon blacks were regarded having distributed micro‐crystalline of 
qusi‐graphite structure on surface usually exists a low content of oxygenated 
functional groups.  When carbon blacks were heated in helium to elevated 
temperature at 800oC or above, most of the oxygenated functional groups were 
decomposed into CO, CO2 or H2O leaving the high energy unsaturated carbon 
dangling bonds on surface.  We proposed these unsaturated carbon dangling bonds 
would be active sites for cracking the reactant‐ethylene into carbon and hydrogen.  
The cracking carbons diffused and self‐assembling on adjacent qusi‐graphite 
structure forming carbon nanotube (CNTs), shown in Fig. 1a (lower magnification ) 
and 1b (close‐up magnification).  
   The mechanism for synthesizing carbon nanotubes on carbon black is disclosed 
as the self‐assembling of the carbon atoms, which cracking by ethylene, on the 
qusi‐graphite structures,  these sites acted as crystalline seeds for piling up the CNTs.  
The preparation of CNTs on carbon blacks would therefore be possible by metal‐free 
CVD process.  This technique is easy to produce large‐scale carbon 
nanotube(CNTs)/carbon black (CB) composites in the traditional carbon black

Conclusions 
Herein, we have described a self‐assembling of multi‐walled carbon nanotubes 
on carbon black at mild temperature.  The topologically heterogeneous structure on 
carbon black surface is the key factor for introducing the decomposition of gas 
hydrocarbons.  The micro‐peripheral crystalline structures on carbon black surface 
are proposed as epitaxial growing sites for self‐assembling of carbon nanotubes.
