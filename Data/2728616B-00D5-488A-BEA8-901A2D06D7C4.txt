tem consisted of a 150 W quartz-halogen lamp chopped at
200 Hz and a grating monochromator. A beam splitter was
placed in the path of the incident light. The intensity of this
radiation was monitored by a pyroelectric detector and was
kept constant by a stepping motor connected to a variable
neutral density filter, which was also placed in the path of the
incident beam. The incident light intensity was maintained at
a constant level of 10−5 W /cm2. The photovoltage spec-
trum on the metal grid was measured with a copper plate as
the ground electrode, using a buffer circuit. The in-phase
signal, measured with respect to the light modulation, re-
corded from a dual phase lock-in amplifier was taken as the
SPV signal. For temperature-dependent SPV measurements,
a closed-cycle cryogenic refrigerator equipped with a digital
thermometer controller was used. The measurements were
recorded over a temperature range 20–300 K with a tempera-
ture stability of 0.5 K or better.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 1a depicts the SPV spectra of samples A–D at
room temperature. Several spectral features are clearly vis-
ible for all samples, which are governed by absorption in the
QW region. The sharp peak nature observed in the funda-
mental transition suggests the transition to be excitonic. In
order to determine the transition energy precisely, the differ-
ential SPV DSPV spectra with respect to the photon en-
ergy, as shown in Fig. 1b, are fitted to the first derivative of
a Lorentzian-type function proposed by Aspnes,10 which is
appropriate for excitonic transitions in QW structures.11,12
The evaluated peak position is marked by an arrow. The
notation mnHL labeled in the figure denotes transitions be-
tween the mth conduction electron and nth heavy light-hole
sublevels. As expected, the spectral features undergo signifi-
cant energetic redshifts with an increase in indium content
due to the reduction in the bandgap energy of the InGaAs
layer. For the prominent 11H feature, the transition energy
and the spectral broadening parameter of sample A are evalu-
ated to be 1.039 eV and 10 meV, respectively. The corre-
sponding values for samples B–D are 1.024 eV and 13 meV,
1.012 eV and 29 meV, and 0.994 eV and 29 meV, respec-
tively. Note that the sharpness and the exciton enhancement
of the 11H transition for samples A and B are clearly visible,
reflecting the higher homogeneity of the InGaAs layer. In
contrast, a drastic increase in the values of the spectral
broadening parameter is observed for samples C and D. The
possible origins for inhomogeneous broadening are the pres-
ence of In clusters and/or fluctuations in the In composition
at the QW interfaces, which leads to a loss of sharpness of
the 11H transition. A relatively weak spectral intensity for a
parity forbidden 12H transition is also observed in the DSPV
spectra see Fig. 1b. The relaxation of the selection rule is
most likely due to the distortion of the symmetry of the wave
functions in the presence of built-in electric field in the QWs.
The 11L transition is attributed to type-II absorption between
light holes LHs in the GaAs layer and electrons in the
strained InGaAs layer and will be explored below.
Displayed in Figs. 2a–2d are the experimental SPV
spectra of samples A–D at several temperatures between 20
and 300 K. As is the case for general semiconductor proper-
ties, all QW-related transitions show a redshift with an in-
crease in temperature. Comparing to the higher temperature
spectra, a distinct difference for the 11L feature could be
noticed for temperature below 100 K. The 11L feature shows
a significant phase difference of the signal for temperature
below 100 K. This observation indicates that the character-
istic of the 11L feature is different from that of the other
spectral features. A most probable explanation is that the

transition occurs below 100 K and the dashed line is a guide to the eye.
For comparison, the 11H transition is also shown.

strain-induced coupling with the spin-orbit-split band.15
Since for InGaAs/GaAs 
0, the effect of the lattice mis-
match strain is to increase the energy gap of the InGaAs
hydrostatic-pressure component and split the degeneracy of
the valence-band edge at the center of the Brillouin zone, so
that the HH band moves up and the LH band moves down,
relative to the unstressed valence band.
To investigate the nature of the observed spectral fea-
tures and to explain their dependence on In composition, we
have solved the one dimensional Schrödinger equation for
finite QWs based on the envelope function approximation16
including the effects of strain.17 The values of the various
strain-related parameters used in the calculation are listed in
Table I.18,19 A linear interpolation was used for the
InxGa1−xAs values. The energy gaps and masses employed
are given as follows:18


= 0.094 − 0.062xm0, 6c
where m0 is the free-electron mass. The value of the strained
conduction band offset ratio Qc=Ec / Ec+Ev is used as
an adjustable parameter. The exciton binding energies are
estimated to be 5 meV in a variational approach20 and are
assumed to be the same for all the transitions except 11L.
The 11L is considered to be a cross-directional real-space
transition with little excitonic behavior so that the binding
energy is neglected in our case. The value of Qc reported by
other groups was varied in the range 0.6–0.81.21–23 Table II
lists the experimental results and theoretical calculation for
the four samples. In this study, we have obtained the best
agreement between experiments and theoretical calculations
for Qc= 672%.
IV. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we have performed a detailed
temperature-dependent SPS investigation of highly strained
InxGa1−xAs /GaAs DQW structures grown by MOVPE with
different In compositions 0.395x0.44 in the tempera-
ture range 20–300 K. The interband transition energies are
determined via a lineshape fit to DSPV spectra and exhibit a
redshift with increasing In composition. A considerable in-
crease in the spectral linewidth for higher In composition
samples results from the presence of In clusters and/or fluc-
tuations in the In composition at the QW interfaces. A com-
prehensive analysis of the anomalous phenomena, which ap-
peared in lower temperature SPV spectra enables us to
determine the band lineup of DQW structures. The process
of separation of carriers within the QW with possible capture
by the interface defect traps plays an important role for phase
change in SPV signal in the vicinity of LH-related feature at
low temperature. Numerical calculations for excitonic transi-
tion energies, with Qc= 672%, are in good agreement
with the experimental results. The results demonstrate the
considerable diagnostic values of the SPS technique for char-
acterizing these highly strained DQW structures.

Abstract
Contactless electroreflectance (CER) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were
used to study the intersubband transitions of a ZnxCd1−xSe/Znx ′Cdy ′Mg1−x ′−y ′Se multiple
quantum well (MQW) structure grown by molecular beam epitaxy for mid-infrared device
applications. The CER spectrum revealed a wide range of possible optical transitions in the
MQW structure. The ground state transition was assigned by comparison with the
photoluminescence emission signal taken from the same structure. A comprehensive analysis
of the CER spectrum led to the identification of various interband transitions. The
intersubband transitions were estimated and confirmed by FTIR measurements. The results
demonstrate the potential of using CER as a complementary technique for the contactless and
nondestructive characterization of the wide band gap II–VI MQW structures for mid-IR
intersubband device applications.

advantages over devices based on interband (IB) transition in
the infrared range [1–3]. ISB devices are usually made of
multiple quantum well (MQW) structures and need a large
band discontinuity to achieve operation at shorter wavelengths

and E0(ZnCdMgSe) are more consistent with n = 2.5, while
the features originating from MQW IB transitions have better
fit with n = 2. The arrows in figure 2 indicate all the energy
values of the transitions resulting from the fit. These values are
also presented in table 1. The notation En–H(L)m represents
the transition from the nth conduction subband to the mth
valence subband of heavy (H) or light (L) hole character,
respectively.
Assignment of the transitions was done according to the
following considerations. The feature at 2.93 ± 0.005 eV was
assigned to the Zn0.24Cd0.25Mg0.51Se barrier by comparison
with the 77 K PL emission of the calibration layer, which was
observed at 3.0 eV, considering that the thermal energy shift
from 77 K to RT is about 70 meV. The signals at 2.073±0.005
and 2.52 ± 0.005 eV were assigned to the E0 and E0 + 0
transitions of the Zn0.46Cd0.54Se grown lattice matched to the
InP substrate according to a previous report [14]. Comparing

table 1, the CER transition at 2.319 ± 0.005 eV is assigned to
the E1–H1 transition.
To complete the identification of the CER features,
a theoretical calculation based on the envelope function
approximation, considering that the quantum well was
doped, was performed [10, 11]. We have used various
relevant parameters (energy gaps, effective masses) of
Zn0.46Cd0.54Se/Zn0.24Cd0.25Mg0.51Se listed in [4]. The well
width (Lw) was assumed to be 23 Å. In order to evaluate
the conduction band offset, Qc = Ec/Eg, we have
also compared the experimental and theoretical results as
illustrated in figure 3. The dotted vertical lines indicate
the experimentally determined energies of the various CER
features from the MQW (see figure 2). The shaded regions
around these vertical lines represent the experimental error in
evaluating the respective energies. The solid lines indicate
the calculated results from various En–H(L)m transitions as a
function of Qc. These transitions correspond to the symmetry
allowed (n = m) ones. As shown in figure 3, the best
agreement between the calculated and the experimental values
for all the transitions was found for Qc = 0.75 ± 0.05. The
obtained value ofQc is slightly smaller than that of the previous
report on ZnxCd1−xSe/Znx ′Cdy ′Mg1−x ′−y ′Se single quantum
well (Qc = 0.82 ± 0.02) by Munˇoz et al [4]. However, the
predicted values of ISB transitions with the obtained Qc by
this study show better agreement with the experimental data
obtained from the FTIR measurements on similar structures
reported by Lu et al [6]. As seen in figures 2 and 3, and
table 1, there is good overall agreement. From these data, the
E1–E2 transition can be estimated to be 400 meV.
The predicted value of the E1–E2 transition was confirmed
by the FTIR measurements. The absorbance for the sample
is obtained by taking the negative logarithm of P -polarized
transmittance over S-polarized transmittance. The normalized
absorbance of the sample is shown in figure 4. An absorption
peak at 376 meV (3.30 µm) is clearly observed and it is
strongly polarization dependent. The full width at half
maxima (FWHM) is 29 ± 3 meV and the ratio of E/Epeak
is of the order of 10%, a signature of bound-to-bound
transition, as usually observed in the conventional III–V
semiconductors [15]. Comparison between the FTIR result

Two thin epitaxial GaAs films on Ge substrates were characterized by photoluminescence PL,
contactless electroreflectance CER, and piezoreflectance PzR techniques. The GaAs films

Franz–Keldysh oscillations of the CER spectra were used to determine the net carrier concentration
of the GaAs films. In addition, the conduction to light-hole band transitions and the conduction to
heavy-hole band transitions that originated from strain induced valence band splitting in GaAs thin

I. INTRODUCTION
As Si device scaling for future generations of comple-
mentary metal-oxide semiconductor CMOS circuits be-
comes increasingly difficult,1 an alternative option becomes
more and more appealing: GaAs and Ge are intrinsically
faster semiconductors than Si, and especially the integration
of a Ge p-type metal-oxide semiconductor with a GaAs
n-type metal-oxide semiconductor is a very attractive re-
placement for fast Si CMOS structures.2,3 Recently, a grow-
ing research interest in GaAs Refs. 4 and 5 and Ge Ref. 6
MOS transistor structures was observed for exactly that rea-
son. For the cointegration of GaAs and Ge MOS structures in
a planar scalable technology, very thin GaAs epitaxy on Ge
is a key requirement. GaAs on Ge film thickness smaller than
100 nm can be achieved with very good epitaxial properties.
Unfortunately, for such a small film thickness, many charac-
terization techniques, such as x-ray diffraction, have reached
their limit, whereas other characterization techniques, such
as transmission electron microscopy, are very costly and time
consuming.
In this work, we have employed photoluminescence
PL, contactless electroreflectance CER, and piezoreflec-
tance PzR techniques to characterize two GaAs films with a
thickness of 1 m. These optical diagnostic tools are ef-
fective as rapid and easy methods to assess the quality of thin
GaAs layers on Ge substrates. The methods are nondestruc-
tive and can yield information about the structural quality of
the material as well as information on the doping materials
and concentration. Both antiphase domain APD-containing
and APD-free GaAs films were grown at 650 °C by metal
organic vapor phase epitaxy MOVPE. The PL intensity of
the APD-free film is much larger than that of the APD-
containing sample. The PL spectra at low temperatures show
the splitting of the band to band recombination peaks, indi-
cating the existence of strain in the GaAs thin film. The CER
spectra show the Franz–Keldysh oscillations FKOs above
the band gap of GaAs. The built-in electric fields, as deter-
mined from the observed FKOs, can be used to evaluate the
net carrier concentration of the GaAs films. By a comparison
of the relative intensities of PzR and CER spectra, the iden-
tification of the conduction to light-hole LH band transi-
tions and the conduction to heavy-hole HH band transitions
that originated from the strain induced valence band splitting
has been achieved. The results demonstrate that PL, CER,
and PzR are useful nondestructive tools to characterize thin
epitaxial GaAs films on Ge substrates.
II. EXPERIMENTAL
Two GaAs films with a thickness of 1 m employed in
this study were grown on Ge001 substrates using MOVPE
in a Thomas Swan reactor. n-type Ge substrates with a mis-
cut angle of 0°/6° off 001 toward 111 were used to grow
APD-containing sample A/APD-free sample B GaAs ep-
itaxial layers. The films were covered with a 20 nm AlAs
layer in order to prevent surface recombination. The precur-
sor sources were trimethylgallium, tertiarybutylarsin, silane
as an n-type dopant, and palladium-purified H2 as a carrier
gas. The growth temperature was 650 °C. The reciprocal
space maps of the films indicated that the GaAs layers are
fully stressed.7
PL spectra were excited using a double frequency 100
mW yttrium aluminum garnet:Nd laser 532 nm. The lumi-
nescence signals were analyzed using a Jobin-Yvon “TRIAX
550” spectrometer equipped with a “Symphony” charge

APD-containing GaAs film is about four orders of magnitude
lower than that of the APD-free one. This reduction in inten-
sity is due to the electrically active Ga–Ga and As–As bonds
at the boundaries between the different APDs, which acts as
strong nonradiative recombination centers.

toward lower energies with increasing temperature. The
separation of these two features is found to be insensitive to
the temperature variations. The results show similar thermal
expansion coefficients for GaAs and Ge in the temperature
range of 15–100 K, indicating that the biaxial stress is
mainly due to a small difference in the lattice constants of
GaAs and Ge.
IV. SUMMARY
In summary, we have characterized two thin epitaxial
GaAs films, one containing APDs and one APD free, on Ge
substrates deposited via MOVPE by using PL, CER, and
PzR techniques. The PL spectra at low temperatures show
the splitting of the band to band recombination peaks, indi-
cating the existence of strain in the GaAs thin film. The PL
intensity of the APD-containing film is four orders of mag-
nitude lower than that of the APD-free sample. The reduction
in intensity is due to the electrically active Ga–Ga and
As–As bonds at the boundaries between the different APDs.
The CER spectra show the FKOs above the band gap of
GaAs. The built-in electric fields, as determined from the
observed FKOs, are used to evaluate the net carrier concen-
tration of the GaAs films. In addition, the conduction to LH
band transitions and the conduction to HH band transitions
that originated from strain induced valence band splitting in
GaAs thin films are observed and identified through a com-
parison of the relative intensities of LH and HH related fea-
tures in the PzR and CER spectra. The results demonstrate
that PL, CER, and PzR are useful nondestructive tools to
characterize thin epitaxial GaAs films on Ge substrates.

3. Results and discussion
The photograph displayed in Fig. 1 is the transmission electronic
microscope (TEM) image of the crystal morphology for Au-ReS2
while the inset in Fig. 1 showed the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of
the TEM image. TEM investigations were done employing a Philips
Tecnai G2 F20 using an acceleration voltage Uacc = 200kV. The b-
axis corresponds to the longest edge of the plate and is parallel to
the Re cluster chains [8]. From FFT, the orientation of the b-axis is
determined to be along the [010] direction. Mechanically, one can
alsodetermineb-axis direction tobe along the edgeof easy cleaving
of the crystal plate.
The indirect band-edge transitions of the Au-ReS2 were studied
by means of near-normal incident polarization-dependent trans-
mittance at 20K. The experimentally measured transmittance data
were utilized to derive the absorption coefﬁcient ˛ (depicted in
Fig. 2) using the equation [10].
T = IT
I0
= (1 − R)
2 exp(−˛d)
1 − R2 exp(−2˛d) (1)
In performing the calculation, we assumed that the temperature
dependence of reﬂectivity R is negligible. In Eq. (1), d is the thick-
ness, IT is the transmitted intensity, and I0 is the incident intensity.
Also displayed in Fig. 2 is a plot of (˛h)1/2 vs. h, where the open
circles (open squares) are deduced data points from the E||b (E⊥b)
polarizationmeasurements and the solid lines are least-squares ﬁts
to the expression [10].

The ﬁtted values of the energy gaps and phonon energy of the
Au-ReS2 crystals at 20K are Eindg‖ = 1.49 ± 0.02eV, Eindg⊥ = 1.51 ±
0.02eV, and Ep =20±5meV. The error for the estimation of Eindg‖ ,
Eindg⊥ , and Ep were derived by considering different range of data
points in the estimation and also from the slight deviation of inci-
dent angles due to non-smooth sample surface. Here, Eindg‖ and E
ind
g⊥
refer, respectively, to the indirect gap for E||b and E⊥b polarizations.
Analysis of the absorption spectra revealed band gap anisotropy
with Eindg⊥ > E
ind
g‖ and their values are red shifted by about 10meV
comparing to that of the pure samples [9,11]. The physical origin of
the shiftmay come from the existence of impurity,which in general
will contribute to the absorption near the band tail.
Displayed by the curves in Fig. 3 are the polarization-dependent
PR spectra in the vicinity of the direct gap of Au-ReS2 at 20K. The
solid lines in Fig. 3 are least-squares ﬁts to the derivative Lorentzian
line shape [12], which yield parameters of the transition energies

1. Introduction
Rhenium diselenide (ReSe2) is a diamagnetic semiconduc-
tor belonging to the family of transition-metal dichalcogenides
crystallized in a distorted CdCl2 structure of triclinic symmetry
with clustering of Re4 diamond units forming a one-dimensional
chain along the b-axis within the van der Waals plane [1,2].
Crystals with triclinic symmetry are optically biaxial with
in-plane anisotropy along and perpendicular to the b-axis.
ReSe2 is a subject of considerable interest because of its
anisotropic properties and potential application as a promis-
ing solar-cell material for efﬁcient photoelectrochemical cells
[3,4].
In this paper, we report the polarization-dependent opti-
cal properties study of Au-doped ReSe2 single crystals. The
temperature-dependent piezoreﬂectance (PzR) and photore-
ﬂectance (PR) measurements with E||b and E⊥b polarizations were
carriedout in the regionof 1.35–1.52 eV. The transitionenergies and
broadening parameters of the observed polarization-dependent
excitonic features for Au-doped were determined and compared

with the undoped one to study the doping effects of Au on the
optical properties of ReSe2.
2. Experimental details
The ReSe2 single crystals doped with Au (denoted as ReSe2:Au) were grown
by the chemical vapor transport method with bromine as a transport agent [5].
The weight of doping material was determined stoichiometrically to obtain the
small concentration of dopant, i.e. 50mg of Au on about 10g of the total charge
weight. ReSe2:Au single crystals formed thin silver-colored, graphite-like platelets
up to 50mm2 (10mm×5mm) in area and ∼100m in thickness. X-ray diffraction
patterns conﬁrmed the triclinic symmetry of the single crystals with all parameters
consistent with those previously reported [2]. Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) [6]
was utilized to examine the Au content of the crystals. The results showed an aver-
age ∼0.15 at.% concentration of Au in the sample crystals. Considerable discrepancy
exists between thenominal doping ratio and that determinedbyAES, indicating that
Re and Au were chemically transported at different rate and most of the Au must
remain in the untransported residual charge. It is also noted that the Au-doped sin-
gle crystals become easy to separate along b-axis in comparison with the undoped
ones.
The PzR/PR apparatus has been described in Ref. [7]. The PzR measurement
was achieved by gluing the thin single crystal specimens on a 0.15 cm thick
lead–zirconate–titanate piezoelectric transducer driven by a 200Vrms sinusoidal
wave at 200Hz. The CASIX Rochon prisms were employed for polarization-
dependent measurements. PR measurement was achieved using an internally
modulated 670nm laser diode served as the pumping beam. The temperature-
dependent measurements were made between 15 and 300K with the temperature
stability of 0.5K or better.

Fig. 3. Temperature-dependent polarized PzR spectra of ReSe2:Au at several tem-
peratures between 15 and 300K. The open-squares and open-diamonds curves
correspond to the experimental data of E||b and E⊥b polarizations, respectively,
and the solid curves are least squares-ﬁts to Eq. (1).
obtained shows a sinusoidal variation with respect to the angular
changeof the linearlypolarized light that corresponds toMalus’ law
[12]. The polarization sensitive behavior of Eex1 and E
ex
2 /E
ex
3 provides
potential usage for ReSe2 to fabricate a polarization sensitive pho-
todetector applied in multi-channel optical communications for
detecting the various orientations of linearly polarized light [13].
Temperature-dependent PzR spectra of ReSe2:Au with the
E||b and E⊥b polarizations are shown in Fig. 3. The results in
Fig. 3 show that up to 175K the higher order features of the
excitonic sequence are ionized. At a still higher temperature,
full ionization process renders the interband excitonic sequence
undetectable. The temperature-dependent transition energies of
band-edge excitons Eex1 , E
ex
2 and E
ex
3 were ﬁtted by Varshni semiem-
pirical relationship [14]: E(T) =E(0)−˛T2/(ˇ + T).Where ˛ is related
to the electron–phonon interaction and ˇ is closely related to
the Debye temperature. Varshni coefﬁcients ˛ and ˇ are deter-
mined to be 0.53±0.05meV/K and 210±75K, 0.54±0.05meV/K
and 210±75K, and 0.51±0.05meV/K and 210±75K for Eex1 , Eex2
and Eex3 , respectively. The results are quite similar to the values of
previous reports on undoped ReSe2 [10].
The temperature dependence of the linewidth was ﬁtted by
 (T) = 0 + LO/[exp(LO/T)−1] [15]: the ﬁrst term  0, represents
broadening invoked from temperature-independent mechanisms,
while the second term is caused by the Fröhlich interaction
described by the strength of the electron (exciton)–LO phonon
coupling  LO and LO phonon temperature LO parameters. The
values of the coupling constant  LO determined to be 65±15meV,
50±15meV and 71±20meV for Eex1 , Eex2 and Eex3 , respectively, are
considerably larger than those reported for a number of semicon-
ductors. We suspected that the large values of  LO may be the
general characteristics of crystals with layer structure.
4. Summary
The anisotropic optical properties of ReSe2:Au single crystals
were studied by polarized PzR and PR measurements. In addition
to higher energy excitonic series, three band-edge excitonic fea-
tures are observed. The Eex1 feature is present in theE||bpolarization
while Eex2 and E
ex
3 features appeared in the E⊥b polarization. The
higher energy excitonic series are similar to the so-called yellow
exciton series as observed in Cu2O, which starts from the excitonic
level n=2. The values of band-edge excitonic transition energies
Eex1 , E
ex
2 and E
ex
3 of ReSe2:Au remain practically unchanged in com-
parison with undoped ReSe2. Nevertheless, the Au-doping effect
shows up in a slight increase of the broadening parameter of the
excitonic features.

sition in the GaAsSb layers was determined to be 0.23, 0.26,
0.32, and 0.39 by double crystal x-ray diffraction measure-
ments.
PR, SPS, and PzR measurements were performed at
room temperature. PR measurements were achieved using an
internally modulated 5 mW laser diode 670 nm as the
modulating source. The laser intensity was reduced to about
1%–10% of its initial value by using a neutral density filter.
A 150 W tungsten-halogen lamp filtered by a PTI 0.25 m
monochromator provided the monochromatic light. The re-
flected light was detected by an InGaAs photodetector, and
the signal was recorded by a lock-in amplifier. The dc output
of the photodetector was maintained constant by a servo
mechanism of variable neutral density filter. The SPS mea-
surements, which used normalized incident light intensity,17
were performed at normal incidence using a fixed grid and
probe light chopped at 230 Hz.18 For comparison the PzR
measurement was achieved by gluing the sample surface on
a 0.15-cm-thick lead-zirconate-titanate piezoelectric trans-
ducer driven by a 160 Vrms sinusoidal wave at 230 Hz.19
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 1 shows PR spectra obtained at room tempera-
ture. At higher energy region, the PR spectra exhibit Franz–
Keldysh oscillations FKOs above the band edge of GaAs.
The period of the FKOs is a direct measure of the built-in
electric field at the GaAsSb/GaAs interface. The built-in
electric field for the present samples is determined to be in
the range of 13–17 kV/cm. The most interesting features are
located below 1.2 eV, and their origin can be attributed to the
optical transitions between confined states in GaAsSb/GaAs
MQWs. We subsequently showed that the currently studied
GaAsSb/GaAs MQWs are of weak type-I for all investigated
samples. Sample with the highest antimony content exhibits
only broad oscillation below GaAs related feature, while for
other samples we can observe a few well defined resonance
features below 1.2 eV.
Surface photovoltage spectra of all four samples are
shown in Fig. 2. To enhance the transitions present in the
SPS spectra, we calculated the numerical derivative spectra,
dESPVE /dE versus E,20 where E is the incident pho-
ton energy. The so-called differential SPS DSPS spectra
showed in the region below GaAs band-gap energy two
groups of QW related features. The lower energy features
broaden as antimony content increases. Similar to the PR
spectra we could observe a redshift of all SPS features with
increasing antimony content.
To identify the origin of the observed transitions present
in the PR and SPS spectra, the type of QW band profile
needs to be verified first. Chiu et al.21 reported large blueshift
of PL peaks of GaAsSb/GaAs MQWs under a moderate op-
tical excitation level. The large blueshift was interpreted in
terms of the band-bending effect due to the spatially photo-
excited carriers in a type-II alignment. To check if this effect
occurs in our case, we measured the excitation power depen-
dence of PL spectra at 15 K using a laser power level be-
tween 0.15 and 150 mW. The obtained PL peak position
dependence on laser power was between 9 and 13 meV, de-
pending on the sample being measured. The measured PL
peak position dependence on laser power is much smaller
than the values reported for type-II structure, suggesting a
more probable existence of type-I band alignment in the
presently studied samples.
A detailed discussion of the obtained PR and SPS data is
presented for the sample with the lowest antimony content
with x=0.23. Figure 3 shows a comparison of PR, DSPS,
and PzR spectra for chosen structure. PR spectrum in the
region of fundamental transition is rather complicated. The
lower energy feature, which is most intense in that region,
can be related to the optical transition between the first
heavy-hole state in the valence band and the first electronic
state in the conduction band. In Fig. 3 this transition is
marked by an arrow with the designation 1hh-1e.

band edge. Vertical line represents the demarcation line for
Sb content upon which the QW structure is changing from
type-I to type-II. Included in Fig. 4 are the numerically fitted
experimental data, where squares, triangles, and circles indi-
cate transition energies obtained from the PR measurements
and stars are those from the SPS measurements. In general,
good agreement between calculated and measured data is
obtained except for 3hh-1e transitions circles. The reason
for the discrepancies may be the interface imperfections,28
which may result in a deviation from the assumed rectangu-
lar QW in the theoretical calculations of the actual samples.
The energy position of the additional features, compar-
ing to PR, as observed in the PzR and DSPS spectra indi-
cated as black stars with error bars in Fig. 4 agrees with
transition energies between the first light-hole states and first
electronic states in the conduction band, 1lh-1e. This obser-
vation agrees with our prediction based on suggestions by
Dumitras and Riechert.27 The presence of light-hole-
originated transition in the PzR spectrum and not in PR spec-
trum is possibly due to higher observation possibility of this
phenomenon in PzR comparing to PR.19 From Fig. 4 we
conclude that the origin of higher energy features denoted as
1lh-cb, comparing to 1lh-1e ones, is transitions between
light-hole states and GaAs band edge. Above comparison of
experimental analysis and numerical calculations lets us
identify features present in PR, SPS and PzR spectra.
IV. CONCLUSION
In this paper we presented PR and SPS studies of
GaAs1−xSbx /GaAs MQW structures with fundamental transi-
tion close to 1.3 m. The optical diagnostic tools of PR and
SPS are powerful supplementary techniques in the investiga-
tions of complicated quantum systems. PR gave detailed in-
formation about the heavy-holes related transitions, while
SPS gave additional information concerning light-holes re-
lated ones. The complimentary technique of PzR spectros-
copy was used. After detailed lineshape analysis of PR, SPS,
and PzR spectra and theoretical calculations based on enve-
lope function approximation, including the effects of strain
and exciton binding energy, we were able to identify spectral
features and their Sb content dependence. The present ex-
perimental investigation with the aids of theoretical analysis
points to the existence of weak type-I band alignment in
samples being under consideration. From the present inves-
tigation, we conclude that the type of confinement for elec-
trons can vary from structure to structure depending on the
built-in strains as a result of GaAsSb growth conditions.

99%, powders were mixed in stoichiometric proportion
and put into a graphite crucible. The crucible was kept at the
temperature of 1830 K for 3 h and then moved out from the
heating zone with a speed of 2.4 mm/h. An argon overpres-
sure of 11 and 12 MPa, respectively, was maintained during
the growth process of Zn0.96Be0.04Se and Zn0.93Mg0.07Se
mixed crystals. The obtained crystals were cut into plates of
about 1 mm thickness and mechanically polished. X-ray in-
vestigations show that the samples are uniform in composi-
tion and exhibit a single sphalerite zinc-blende phase.15,16
It has to be emphasized that prior to any optical experi-
mentation, the sample must be treated with further mechani-
cal polishing and a chemical etching process to remove me-
chanical defects on the surface. The sample was
mechanically polished using successively finer abrasives
with the final polishing process using 0.05 m aluminum-
oxide Al2O3 powder. For optical measurements, the sample
was additionally etched in a mixture of
K2Cr2O7:H2SO4:H2O with a proportion of 3:2:1, followed
by a treatment in CS2 and 50% NaOH solution.17 The crys-
tals used in this study were as-grown and not doped inten-
tionally.
The PL spectra were excited using the 325 nm line
55 mW of a He-Cd laser. The luminescence signals were
analyzed by using a Jobin-Yvon “TRIAX 550” spectrometer
equipped with a “SIMPHONY” charge-coupled device
CCD camera. In CER experiments an ac modulating volt-
age 1 kV and 200 Hz is applied between a front wire
grid electrode and a second electrode consisting of a metal
plate. These two electrodes are separated by an insulating
spacer in such a manner that there is a very thin layer
0.1 mm of air or vacuum between the front surface of
the sample and the front electrode. Thus, there is no direct
contact with the front surface of the sample. The probe beam
enters through the front wire grid. The radiation from a 150
W xenon arc lamp filtered by a 0.25 m monochromator pro-
vided the monochromatic light. The reflected light was de-
tected by an UV-enhanced silicon photodiode. The dc output
of this silicon photodiode was maintained constant by a
servo mechanism of variable neutral density filter. A dual-
phase lock-in amplifier was used to measure the detected
signals. In PR measurements, the modulation of the built-in
electric field is caused by photoexcited electron-hole pairs
created by a mechanically chopped 325 nm line 1 mW
of a He-Cd laser. The modulating frequency is set at 200 Hz.
The entire data acquisition procedure has been performed
under computer control. Multiple scans over a given photon
energy range were programmed until a desired signal-to-
noise level was attained. For temperature-dependent mea-
surements, a closed-cycle cryogenic refrigerator equipped
with a digital thermometer controller was used for the low-
temperature measurements. For the high-temperature experi-
ments, the sample was mounted on one side of a copper
finger of an electrical heater, which enabled one to control
and stabilize the sample temperature. The temperature-
dependent measurements were made between 15 and 400 K
with a temperature stability of 0.5 K or better.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 1 presents the temperature evolution of PL spec-
tra of the Zn0.96Be0.04Se sample. At 15 K, the PL spectrum
consists of a strong and sharp free-exciton line at 2.89 eV,
the so-called “edge luminescence”18 at 2.79 eV with two
well-resolved LO-phonon structures and deep-levels emis-
sion bands at around 2.35 eV. As shown in Fig. 1, the first
peak shifts monotonically toward lower energy and broadens
with increasing temperature in the range from 15 to 300 K,
and the second one is completely thermally quenched at tem-
perature higher than about 100 K. To examine the origin of
these two near-band-edge luminescence features, the excita-
tion intensity-dependent PL measurements have also been
carried out at 15 K. A linear dependence with a slope near
unity was obtained for the first peak and no shift of the
emission energy as a function of the excitation laser intensity
was observed. The results indicate that this luminescence
line is dominated by excitonic radiative recombination and
denoted as X. On the contrary, the second emission band
shifts toward higher photon energies with increasing inten-
sity of the exciting radiation. Taking into account the higher-
energy shift with increasing excitation intensity as well as
the thermal quenching, the second broader feature is inter-
preted to be an “edge emission” due to recombination of
shallow donor-acceptor pairs DAPs.
Figure 2 shows the temperature-dependent PL spectra of
the Zn0.93Mg0.07Se sample. At 15 K, the PL spectrum con-
sists of a weak narrow feature an exciton line denoted as X,
shallow DAP edge-, and deep-level emission bands. For
Zn0.93Mg0.07Se, the edge-emission bands exhibits partially
resolved phonon structure. From the analysis of the line
shape of this band, a LO phonon energy LO=36 meV has
been estimated. This value is larger than that of ZnSe 31.8
meV.19 It is noted that the ratio of intensities of the exciton
line to the near-band-edge emission of Zn0.93Mg0.07Se is
much smaller than that of Zn0.96Be0.04Se, indicating a poorer
quality of the Mg-containing sample. Similar to that in
Zn0.96Be0.04Se, the exciton feature in Zn0.93Mg0.07Se shifts
monotonically toward lower energy and broadens the line-
width with increasing temperature in the range from 15 to
300 K.

poses the band-edge excitonic peak positions in the PL spec-
tra of Zn0.96Be0.04Se and Zn0.93Mg0.07Se open squares and
circles are also displayed in Fig. 4. It is noticed that the peak
positions of the band-edge exciton features in the PL spectra
correspond quite well slightly lower energy to the funda-
mental transition energies obtained from electromodulation
data.

measured by PL for the Be-containing sample is more in-
tense than that of Mg-containing sample. Moreover, for the
low-temperature CER spectra, well-resolved Rydberg’s se-
ries with n=1 and 2 can be clearly observed for the Be-
containing mixed crystal, while only a single feature is ob-
served for the Mg-containing sample. This comparative
study indicates a superior performance of the Be incorpora-
tion into the mixed ternary crystals. The temperature depen-
dence of the fundamental and spin split-off band gaps has
been analyzed by both Varshni and Bose-Einstein-type ex-
pressions. The parameters extracted from both expressions,
by extending into the high-temperature regime, are found to
agree reasonably well. The parameters that describe the tem-
perature dependence of the broadening function of the band-
edge exciton line have also been studied. The value of 0
for the investigated Be/Mg containing samples is much
larger than those of Be/Mg free thin films samples, indicat-
ing the difficulty of growing uniform ZnBeSe and ZnMgSe
ternary mixed crystals. The larger value of LO is related to
the higher effective longitudinal optical phonon energy and
the presence of a larger deformation potential interaction of
the Be/Mg containing samples.

because the pumped electrons are almost collected at the 
ground state, usually only one PL feature can be found. 
Thus it is difficult to investigate the high order transitions 
of QW using PL measurements. Contrast with the PL tech-
nique, PR is also a nondestructive characterization method 
and is widely used for the study of semiconductor device 
structures [4]. Since PR is an electro-absorptive modula-
tion reflectance spectroscopy technique, except the funda-
mental ground state transition corresponding to the PL 
peak, other high order transitions such as 11L (i.e. transi-
tion between ground states in the conduction and light hole 
bands) and 12H (i.e. transition between the ground state in 
the conduction band and the first excited state in the heavy 
hole band) transitions can also be detected. Thus the PR 
spectroscopy is a suitable technology for studying the 
quantum well interdiffusion [5, 6]. In this study we find 
that the degree of intermixing can be measured by evaluat-
ing the energy shifting magnitude of 11H transition ob-
served in PL and PR spectra after ion implantation and 
rapid thermal annealing (RTA) processes. Furthermore, us-
ing PR measurements the relaxing strain in the quantum 
well can be studied through the splitting energy between 
the 11H and 11L transitions. 
 
 2 Experimental results The samples used in this 
study were fabricated by metal organic chemical vapor 
deposition (MOCVD) on an InP substrate and consisted  
of the following layers: an In0.818Ga0.182As0.4P0.6 (30 nm) 
separate-confinement-heterostructure (SCH) layer, a 5 pe-
riod stack of In0.82Ga0.18As0.785P0.125 /In0.725Ga0.275As0.535P0.465 
(60/90 Å) multiple quantum wells (MQWs), an 
In0.818Ga0.182As0.4P0.6 (30 nm) SCH layer, a Zn-doped InP 
(0.1 µm) cladding layer, an In0.818Ga0.182As0.4P0.6 (20 nm) 
etching-stop layer, and a Zn-doped InP (0.45 µm) buffer 
layer. In order to investigate the effects of ion implantation 
and annealing on the interdiffusion, we prepared four  
samples designated as A, B, C and D. Each sample with  
an area of 2 × 5 mm located at the near region on the  
same wafer. After the base structure was performed, a 
400 nm thick SiO2 layer was selectively grown on the area 
of samples A and C to block the ion bombardment. Phos-
phorous ions with a dose of 5 × 1014 (cm–2) and an energy 
of 100 keV were uniformly implanted on the wafer. In or-
der to avoid the tunneling effect, the implantation has been 
done in a tilt angle of 7° and at the same time the substrate 
was heated up to temperature of 200 °C. Before proceeding 
to the RTA process, the wafer was separated into four dif-
ferent pieces and the SiO2 mask layer on samples A and C 
was leaved off. A successive RTA process was applied to 
these samples at temperature of 670 °C. The annealing 
time applied to samples A and B is 60 s, and is 120 s for 
samples C and D. Finally, the three layers above the top 
SCH layer have been etched for the convenience of optical 
measurements. 
 The PR measurement was achieved using a 10 mW 
He–Ne laser, chopped at 200 Hz, as the modulating source. 
The laser intensity was reduced to about 10% of its initial 
value by using a neutral density filter. The monochromatic 
probe light was provided by a 150 W tungsten-halogen 
lamp filtered by a 0.25 m monochromator. The reflected 
light was detected by an InGaAs photodetector, and the 
signal was recorded from an NF model 5610B lock-in am-
plifier. The PL measurements were excited by the same 
He–Ne laser with a power density about 100 mW/cm2, and 
the luminescent signal was recorded by the same detecting 
devices described above. 
 
 3 Results and discussion Figure 1(a) to (d) show 
the PL and PR spectra by the dotted and solid lines, respec-
tively, taken at 300 K from the samples A, B, C and D. 
Only one PL feature, which is attributed to the 11H radia-
tive recombination, is observed for each sample. Compar-
ing the PL spectra of samples A and B, the effect of ion 
implantation on the interdiffucation can be achieved. We 
found that the transition energy of 11H shifts from 
0.796 eV (sample A) to 0.821 eV (sample B). Note that 
sample A has an intentionally deposited SiO2 mask layer 
on its top to prevent the ion bombardment, while the sam-
ple B has no protection layer. Since the annealing param-
eters are the same for these two samples, the shift is re-
sponsible for the effect of ion-induced vacancies resulting 
from implantation process. The energy shift reflects the 
fact that the degree of intermixing has been enhanced by 
these vacancies, which diffuse down to the quantum well 
region enhancing the interdiffusion. A similar result is 
found in the PL spectra of samples C and D, its peak 
moves from 0.804 eV (sample C) to 0.848 eV (sample D). 
This larger energy shift is due to the continuously interdif-
fusion enhancement under longer annealing times. For 
each PR spectrum shown in Fig. 1, three excitronic fea-
tures are observed, and these spectra have been fitted by 
least-square fits to the first derivative Lorentzian line shape 
(FDLL), as shown by the open circles. The obtained inter-
subband energies of mnH(L) transitions are indicated by 
arrows in Fig. 1. Comparing the 11H transition energy of 
these four samples, it is found that for samples A and B the 
transition energy shifts from 0.793 eV to 0.819 eV, and  
for samples C and D the transition energy moves from 
0.802 eV to 0.845 eV. A consistent result is observed from 
the transition energy of 11H extracted from PL and PR 
spectra. In order to analysis the degree of intermixing for 
these samples, it is necessary to calculate the well- and bar-
rier- shapes after diffusion, and then solve the Schrödinger 
equation for the resulting conduction- and valence-band 
energy profiles. The theoretical analysis used in this paper 
is described as follows. However the diffusion may be af-
fected by strain and defect concentraction, a constant diffu-
sivity can be used in a short annealing time range. For long 
annealing duration a diffusion equation including the strain 
effect has been formulated by Ryu et al. in Ref. [7]. In this 
work, we assume that the interdiffusion between the well 
and barrier materials obeys Fick’s law. The interdiffusion 
of  Ga (and In) atoms is characterized by a diffusion length 
Ld(III), which is defined as d(III) D= ,L Dt  where D is the dif-

where z is the growth direction, 
rl
( )zψ  is the envelope func-
tion, m* is the effective mass, Er1 is the quantized energy 
level with respect to the subband energy zeroed at the bot-
tom of the QW, and r = c, hh or lh refers to the electron, 
heavy- or light-hole band, respectively. This equation is 
solved numerically to obtain the quantized energy levels 
and the envelope wavefunctions. Figure 3 shows the transi-
tion energy of 11H as a function of diffusing length of 
Ld(III). The four curves present the calculated results using 
different kd parameter increasing from 0.3 to 0.9. As de-
scribed above, the composition profile after interdiffusion 
is characterized by a diffusion length 
d D
= ,L Dt  where D 
is the diffusion coefficient and tD is the diffusion time, i.e. 
annealing time. The annealing time of sample C is twice  
of that for sample A, so the diffusion length of  sample C 
should be in a factor of 2  the diffusion length of sample 
A. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the 11H transition energies of 
samples A and C deduced from PR spectra are indicated by 
open and solid squares, respectively. Following this crite-
rion, we found that the experimental data match well to the 
theoretical curve with kd = 0.3 at the diffusion length of 
13 Å and 18 Å for samples A and C, respectively. This 
analysis is also applied on samples B and D, we find that a 
well match between PR data, shown by open and solid tri-
angles, and theoretical calculation is found on the curve 
with kd = 0.7. The diffusion length of group-III atoms is in-
creased to 16 Å and 23 Å for samples B and D. Due to 
complex mechanisms of intermixing in quantum well 
structure, the diffusion length can be affected by dielectric 
capping materials and thickness, quantum well composi-
tions, implantation and annealing conditions. A dielectric 
capping layer such as SiO2 or SiNx will enhance the diffu-
sion by increased vacancies. In this study low-energy P+ 
ions were used to create point defects well above the active 
region. So the amount of defects is strongly correlated  
to the amount of diffusion length. Under the effect of low-

energy ion implantation the diffusion length of group-III 
elements has been enhanced. Based on our knowledge, the 
diffusion length with the similar implantation and anneal-
ing conditions has not been reported. Compared to the  
data reported in Ref. [9], the diffusion length of group-III 
elements in InGaAsP/InP multiquantum-well structure 
changes from 5 Å to 20 Å for different annealing times. 
From the amount of PL blueshift of 11H transition ob-
served in our study, the diffusion length has been estimated 
quite reasonably. It is worth to point out that the increase of 
kd implies the interdiffusion rate of the group-V sublattice 
has been enhanced through P+ ions implantation process.

 1 Introduction Lattice-matched Ga0.52In0.48P grown 
on a GaAs substrate has received considerable attention 
due to its potential applications in optoelectronic and  
electronic devices, such as semiconductor lasers [1],  
heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) [2], and high-
efficiency tandem solar cells [3]. Spontaneous ordering in 
Ga0.52In0.48P has been widely investigated in recent years 
[4–6]. Depending on the growth conditions, Ga0.52In0.48P 
could be grown on GaAs substrates in an orderly or a dis-
orderly fashion which results in the discrepancy of band 
gap energy [7]. The ordering phenomenon in such com-
pounds is a very important property as it allows changes in 
the electronic and optical properties. 
 A small amount of nitrogen incorporation is known to 
reduce the band gap energy in GaxIn1–xAs dramatically; the 
reduction results mostly from the lowering of the conduc-
tion band [8]. A similar effect in nitrogen incorporated 
GaxIn1–xP has been reported [9, 10]. These properties thus, 
make GaxIn1–xNyP1–y a suitable candidate for the emitter and 
the collector of HBTs, especially for the blocked hole 
HBTs with a reduced offset and knee voltages [11]. De-
spite its possible applications, to date there have been few 
reports on GaxIn1–xNyP1–y [12, 13].
 
 In this study, we employ polarized piezoreflectance 
(PzR) and photoreflectance (PR) measurements to study 
the effects of nitrogen incorporation on Ga0.46In0.54NyP1–y al-
loys. The Ga0.46In0.54NyP1–y epilayers were grown on 
GaAs(100) semi-insulating substrates by gas-source mo-
lecular-beam epitaxy (GSMBE). The anisotropic optical 
properties of Ga0.46In0.54NyP1–y epitaxial layers along the 
[110] and [110]  directions are characterized by polarized 
PzR spectra. The additional features below GaAs band edge 
region are observed in PR spectra. The origin of these in-
ter-subband transition features are discussed and are attrib-
uted to the type-II band alignment in Ga0.46In0.54NyP1–y/GaAs 
heterostructures. 
 
 2 Experimental detail The Ga0.46In0.54NyP1–y epilay-
ers studied in this work were grown on GaAs(100) semi-
insulating substrates by GSMBE using elemental gallium 
(Ga) and indium (In), thermally cracked arsin (AH3) and 
phosphine (PH3), and a RF plasma nitrogen radical beam

crystal-field splitting to band and E0 + Δ0 is spin–orbit 
splitting to band transitions. The values of E0, E0 + Δs and 
E0 + Δ0 obtained for samples A, B, C and D are listed in 
Table 1. It should be noted that both the strain and atomic 
ordering induced the valence band splitting, while strain, 
ordering and clustering can all lead to a band gap reduction 
[19]. The existence of spontaneous ordering in GaInNP 
promoted by nitrogen incorporation was also supported by 
the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy [20] 
as well as by the Raman studies [21]. 
 Figure 3 illustrates room-temperature PR spectra in the 
range from 1.25 eV to 1.55 eV. The PR spectra exhibit 
Franz–Keldysh oscillations (FKOs) above the band edge 
of GaAs. The period of the FKOs is a direct measurement 
of the built-in electric field at the interface between GaAs 
buffer layer and Ga0.46In0.54NyP1–y. The position of the n-th

hh

GaAs [22]. It has been demonstrated that the FKOs in the 
region of the direct gap are determined by 
hh
*
m  because of 
the greater density of states in relation to the light-hole 
band [23]. From the FKOs, the electric field in the GaAs 
region for sample A, B, C and D is evaluated to be 21, 14, 
12 and 11 kV/cm, respectively, showing a monotonous de-
crease of the electric field as the nitrogen content increases. 
 Figure 4 depicts the DC optical bias dependent PR 
spectra of sample B in the range between 1.32 eV and 
1.52 eV. The optical bias was provided by an additional 
steady-state illumination of a 780 nm laser diode. FKOs 
above the GaAs band edge and inter-subband transition 
features below GaAs band edge were observed in the PR 
spectra. The built-in electric field determined from the pe-
riod of the FKOs decreases slightly and the inter-subband 
transition energies shift toward lower energy region with 
the increase of the intensity of the DC optical bias. The  
decrease of the built-in electric field and redshift of inter-
subband transition energies with the increase of the inten-
sity of the DC optical bias can be understood by the  
existence of the interface states. As noted in Fig. 4, the  
decrease of the electric field reduces the intensity of the 
transition at ~1.38 eV. This indicates that it is an electric 
field tunnelling assisted transition and will be further dis-
cussed in the following section. 
 As shown in Fig. 3, additional features (indicated by 
arrows) appear in the PR spectra at energies lower than the 
band gap energy E0 of GaAs for nitrogen incorporated 
samples. These features can be attributed to the transitions 
between the confined levels in the triangle potential well at 
the interface between GaAs and Ga0.46In0.54NyP1–y. As is 
well known, the band alignment for Ga0.46In0.54P/GaAs is 
type I (see Fig. 5(a)). The incorporation of nitrogen re-
duces the band gap energy in Ga0.46In0.54NyP1–y with most of 
the reduction results  from lowering the conduction band.

Paper
applications, very little work has been done on the optical 
properties related to thermal annealing effects in Sb/In 
containing materials. For example, the optical transition 
features originated from the valence band splitting and 
their temperature dependent near band edge interband tran-
sitions properties is only little known. Hence, further study 
on the thermal annealing effects of GaAsSb and GaAsSbN 
alloys is not only interesting but also necessary and impor-
tant. 
 In this study, we present piezoreflectance (PzR) and 
photoreflectance (PR) study of thermal annealing effects 
on strained GaAs0.916Sb0.084 and GaAs0.906Sb0.075N0.019 films 
grown on GaAs substrates by gas-source molecular beam 
epitaxial (MBE). By a comparison of the relative intensity 
of PzR and PR spectra, the identification of conduction to 
heavy-hole (HH) band and conduction to light-hole (LH) 
band transitions originated from the strained induced va-
lence band splitting has been achieved. The annealing  
effects of the near band edge transitions are studied. The 
temperature dependent behaviors of these transition ener-
gies in the range from 15–300 K are also observed. The 
parameters that describe the temperature variations of the 
near band edge transition energies are evaluated and dis-
cussed. 
 
 2 Experimental detail The GaAs0.916Sb0.084 and 
GaAs0.906Sb0.075N0.019 layers were grown on (100) semi-
insulating GaAs substrate via a VG-V80 gas-source MBE 
system. An EPI Sb cracking cell was used to provide 
mixed dimmer and monomer Sb beam. As2 beam was from 
a gas cell with a cracking temperature of 1000 °C. The 
precursor was AsH3. Ga flux, calibrated using an ion gauge 
to keep the growth rate at 1 μm/h, was provide by an EPI 
uni-bulb RF plasma K-cell operating at a radio frequency 
of 13.56 MHz. A PBN shutter was placed in front of the  
K-cell to reduce the ionized species. The thickness of the 
samples in this study is 1 μm with growth temperature at 
490 °C. The compositions of the GaAs0.916Sb0.084 and 
GaAs0.906Sb0.075N0.019 were quantified by electron probe  
X-ray microanalyzer (EPMA) with GaAs, GaN, and GaSb 
as standards for ZAF (atomic number Z, absorption A,  
and fluorescence F) correction. The GaAs0.916Sb0.084 and 
GaAs0.906Sb0.075N0.019 were ex situ annealed at temperature 
800 °C for 300 s in N2 ambient during the thermal anneal-
ing process. 
 For the PzR measurements, the thin samples were 
glued on a 0.15 cm thick lead zirconate titanate piezoelec-
tric transducer driven by a 200Vrms sinusoidal source at 
200 Hz. The alternating expansion and contraction of the 
transducer subjected the sample to an alternating strain 
with a typical rms Δl/l value of ~10–5. PR measurements 
were achieved using an internally modulated 670 nm laser 
diode served as the pumping beam. The radiation from a 
150 W tungsten-halogen lamp filtered by a 0.25 m mono-
chromator provided the monochromatic light. The reflected 
light was detected by an InGaAs photodetector. The dc 
output of photodetector was maintained constant by a 
servo mechanism of variable neutral density filter. A dual-
phase lock-in amplifier was used to measure the detected 
signals. Multiple scans over a given photon energy range 
was programmed until a desired signal-to-noise level  
has been attained with computer controlled data acquisi- 
tion procedure. Detailed PzR and PR configurations have  
been described elsewhere [12, 13]. For temperature de-
pendent measurement, a closed-cycle cryogenic refrigera-
tor equipped with a digital thermometer controller was 
used for the low temperature measurements with a tem-
perature stability of 0.5 K or better. 
 
 3 Results and discussion Figure 1 show PzR and 
PR spectra for the as-grown and annealed GaAs0.916Sb0.084 
(Fig. 1(a)) and GaAs0.906Sb0.075N0.019 (Fig. 1(b)) samples at 
room temperature. The dotted lines are the experimental 
data and full curves are the least-squares fits to the deriva-

where Aj and Φj are the amplitude and phase of the line

of the transitions, and the value of n depends on the origin 
of the transitions. For derivative functional form, n = 2  
is appropriate for the bound states such as excitons.  
As shown in Fig. 1, the lineshape fits for both PzR  
and PR spectra clearly show two structures (indicate with  
arrows) near the band edge of GaAs0.916Sb0.084 and 
GaAs0.906Sb0.075N0.019. To identify the physical origin of the 
doublets, we make a spectral comparison of the PzR and 
PR measurements. 
 For the PzR measurement under [001]-symmetry co-
planar stress, the intensity ratio between conduction to 
light-hole (LH) band transitions and the conduction to 
heavy-hole (HH) band has been shown to follow the rela-

minimize the local strain around N or Sb sites. However, 
GaAsSbN has a notable difference with GaInNAs, since 
substitutional N atoms can only bond to Ga. Therefore, the 
degree of influence of As or Sb environment around N at-
oms is certainly of second order as group V atoms are sec-
ond nearest neighbours of N. As a consequence, it can be 
speculated that the electronic structure of GaAsSbN would 
be less sensitive to thermal treatment than GaInNAs. This 
speculation is in contradiction with the present experimen-
tal results. A different origin such as a band gap shift due 
to the chemical change of the second-nearest-neighbouring 
atoms to the N atoms can be considered to explain the 
presently observed blue-shift.

temperatures between 15 K and 300 K. The solid lines are 
the fitted spectral data to Eq. (1) with n = 2, which yield 
transition energies indicated by arrows. As the general 
property of most semiconductors, when the measuring 
temperature is increased, the HH and LH transitions in the 
PR spectra exhibit an energy red-shift characteristic.

that of GaAs0.916Sb0.084. The temperature dependences of 
these near band edge transition energies are analyzed using 
the Varshni expression and an expression containing the 
Bose–Einstein occupation factor for phonons. The pa-
rameters that describe the temperature dependences of 
GaAsSbN alloys are similar to that of GaAsN and GaAsSb 
and smaller than that of GaAs. This has been attributed to 
the incorporation of nitrogen/antimony into the GaAsSbN 
alloys.

visible luminescence in GaSe1-xSx (0 B x B 0.5). The
e-stacking fault existed in the b-GaS just makes a recombi-
nation center for irradiating the blue emission.
2 Experimental details
GaSe1-xSx layered single crystals with x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3,
0.4, and 0.5 were grown by VB method and the GaS
compound was grown by CVT method using Br2 as a
transport agent. The standard processes for the VB and
CVT growth were described elsewhere [6, 7]. It is noticed
that the growth of highly S-incorporated crystals were
considerably more difficult than growing pure GaSe in the
VB method due to much higher sulfur pressure is existed
inside the quartz tube. The as-grown GaSe1-xSx crystals
are essentially layer type with the surface area from 4 mm2
to 60 mm2. For X-ray studies, several small crystals from
each batch of GaSe1-xSx (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and
1) were finely ground and the X-ray powder patterns were
taken and recorded by means of a slow moving radiation
detector. The copper Ka radiation (k = 1.542 A˚) was
employed in the X-ray diffraction measurements. For PL
experiments, a cw helium–cadmium laser consisted of a
325-nm and a 442-nm spectral line was utilized for the
pumping light source. The 442-nm laser line combined
with a bandpass filter of 441.6 ± 2.0 nm was used for the
characterization of GaSe1-xSx (0 B x B 0.5) while the
325-nm spectral line together with a short pass filter of
405 ± 5 nm cut edge for studying the GaS. The mea-
surements were done with the pumping laser impinged at
the as-grown (001) surface of the layers. For PzR mea-
surements, the thin specimen of the sample was closely
attached on a lead–zirconate–titanate (PZT) piezoelectric
transducer driven by a 200 Vrms sinusoidal wave. The
alternating expansion and contraction of the transducer
subjects the sample to an alternating strain with a typical
rms Dl/l value of *10-5. A dual-phase lock-in amplifier
was utilized for sensing the ac signals.
3 Results and discussions
Figure 1 shows the as-grown layer crystals of GaSe1-xSx with
x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 1, respectively. The crystals
shows dark-red to yellow colors with increasing the sulfur
composition from x = 0 to x = 1. The variation of colors in
the crystals implies that the band gaps of the gallium chalc-
ogenides are within the visible portion. Displayed in Fig. 2 are
the X-ray diffraction patterns of GaSe, GaSe0.9S0.1,
GaSe0.8S0.2, GaSe0.7S0.3, GaSe0.6S0.4, GaSe0.5S0.5, and GaS,
respectively. A large number of diffraction peaks are observed
in the 2H angular range between 10 and 90. Several peak
features of the diffraction curve vary toward to the higher
diffraction angles with respect to the increase of the sulfur
compositions. This result confirms the smaller lattice con-
stants of the higher sulfur incorporated GaSe1-xSx solids.
Observing in detail on the variation of diffraction peaks in
Fig. 2, the GaSe1-xSx (0 B x B 1) layers seem not containing
only one structural phase. It can be classified into three dif-
ferent kinds of stacking phases. In general, the e stacking is for
GaSe and GaSe0.9S0.1, b phase for GaS, and e–b mixed phase
for GaSe0.8S0.2, GaSe0.7S0.3, GaSe0.6S0.4, and GaSe0.5S0.5.
The lattice constants of GaSe1-xSx layers can be analyzed
from the diffraction peaks in Fig. 2 using the hexagonal sys-
tem [8]. The values of lattice constants are determined to be
a(c) = 3.750 ± 0.010 A˚ (15.94 ± 0.02 A˚), 3.735 ± 0.010
A˚ (15.90 ± 0.02 A˚), 3.724 ± 0.010 A˚ (15.88 ± 0.02 A˚),
3.715 ± 0.010 A˚ (15.85 ± 0.02 A˚), 3.702 ± 0.010 A˚
(15.81 ± 0.02 A˚), and 3.696 ± 0.010 A˚ (15.79 ± 0.02 A˚)
for GaSe, GaSe0.9S0.1, GaSe0.8S0.2, GaSe0.7S0.3, GaSe0.6S0.4,
and GaSe0.5S0.5, respectively.
Displayed in Fig. 3 are the PL and PzR spectra of GaSe,
GaSe0.9S0.1, GaSe0.8S0.2, GaSe0.7S0.3, GaSe0.6S0.4, GaSe0.5
S0.5, and GaS, respectively. The dashed lines are the
experimental results and the solid lines are least-square fits
to a Gaussian (PL) and a derivative Lorentzian line-shape
function (PzR). The transition energies that denoted as Ee
and Eb obtained from the line-shape fits of the PL and PzR
spectra are indicated with arrows. The luminescence fea-
ture Ee in the PL spectra of GaSe1-xSx (0 B x B 1)
demonstrates an energy blue-shift behavior with respect to
the increase of S compositions. Observing in Fig. 3 the
peak positions of the PL spectra (i.e., Ee) for both GaSe and
GaSe0.9S0.1 are matched well with the transition features

which is shown as a hollow diamond in Fig. 4 and present
in a down arrow in Fig. 3. The Eb feature for GaS is closely
related to an ionized exciton that had been found in the
low-temperature absorption and PzR spectra [9, 10]. From
the experimental results of PL and PzR, the structural
phases of the GaSe1-xSx series can be classified into three
different kinds of stacking phase. The e-stacking phase
dominates in GaSe and GaSe0.9S0.1, while the intermediate
compositions of x C 0.2 belong to the e–b mixing phase.
For GaS, the b phase is the dominant but a little e-stacking
fault is still existed inside the layer to make the green-blue
visible luminescences. The stacking types for the e- (D3h)
and b- (D6h) GaX are also depicted in Fig. 4. The e- and
b-stacking types are essentially the basic formula com-
prised in the layered gallium chalcogenides.
4 Conclusions
In conclusion, structural and optical properties of GaSe1-xSx
have been characterized using X-ray diffraction, PL, and
PzR measurements. From the experimental analysis, GaSe
and GaSe0.9S0.1 are confirmed to be the e-stacking phase.
The intermediate compositions of x C 0.2 belong to the e–b
mixing phase. GaS belongs to the b phase but a little
e-stacking fault still existed inside the crystal. PL results of
the GaSe1-xSx (0 B x B 1) show visible luminescences of
625–480 nm emitted from the whole series layers. This
consequence provides potential usage for GaSe1-xSx to be
applied in full-color optoelectronics.

layer crystals was analysed by energy dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDXS), showing an atomic Re/S ratio of
1.0:2.0. No Au could be detected in EDX even though this
method is sensitive to concentrations of dopant C0.1% [7].
Hall effect measurements revealed p-type semiconducting
behaviour. Temperature-dependent electrical conductivity
measurements along and perpendicular to the b-axis in the
van der Waals plane were carried out in the temperature range
from 20 to 300 K. The PC measurements were set up by using
monochromatic light from an Oriel 150 W Tungsten–halo-
gen lamp while the signal was measured by a lock-in
amplifier and recorded by a computer. Anisotropic response
of crystal is excited for linearly polarized light, incident
normal to the basal plane [k//(001)]. Photoconductivity
measurement is used to measure the indirect band-edge
absorption of semiconductor for determining the energy
gaps.
3 Results and discussion
The anisotropic conductivity study of Au-doped ReS2
single crystals over a temperature range from 20 to 300 K
were performed. Figure 1 shows the conductivity of Au-
doped ReS2 single crystals, where the hollow squares,
circles are data points deduced from the conductivity
measurements with the electric currents parallel and per-
pendicular to b-axis, respectively. At room temperature, the
conductivities were 792 and 93 (X-cm)-1 for rkb and r?b,
respectively. From the electrical measurements, the con-
ductivity anisotropy rkb=r?b
 
is found to be 8.5 and
showed some lowering compared to the value of 10 for
undoped ReS2 [8]. The temperature dependence of con-
ductivity in the range 200–280 K can be expressed as [8]:
rðTÞ ¼ r0 exp Ea
kT
 
ð1Þ
where Ea is the carriers activation energy. From Fig. 1 the
lnr versus 1,000/T graphs show the linear regions where
the slopes yield carriers activation energies to be
Ea = 73 ± 10 and 84 ± 10 meV for rkb and r?b,
respectively. The obtained activation energy is consider-
ably smaller than the undoped ReS2 single crystal’s value
of 178 meV [8]. The anisotropic PC responses for various
configurations with E k b and E ? b are illustrated in
Fig. 2a and b, respectively. The temperature-dependent PC
spectra were fitted by a Lorentzian lineshape function. The
results yield the transition energies indicated with arrows in
Fig. 2a and b. By comparing with the absorption, PzR and
PC measurements [9, 10], the observed PC features are
determined to be due to excitonic transitions. The energy
values obtained from PC spectra at 20 K are
Eex1 = 1.553 ± 0.005 eV, E

where aB represents the strength of the electron/exciton–
phonon interaction and HB corresponds to the average
phonon temperature. The fitted values of EB, aB and HB for
E k b E ? b polarizations for Au-doped ReS2 are listed in
Table 1. The value of the electron–phonon interaction
parameter aB for the Egk feature is larger than for Eg?. In the
temperature range 80 to 300 K the linear change of the gap
versus temperature has been observed with a temperature
coefficient dEgk=dT ¼ 0:42 meV/K and dEg?=dT ¼
0:35 meV/K from PC. The result indicates a faster tem-
perature shift of the Egk transition than that of Eg? which is
similar to the value for undoped ReS2 [10].
The dashed curves are least-squares fits to a Varshni

where a and b are constants. b is closely related to the Debye
temperature. The fitted values of E(0), a and b are summa-
rized in Table 1. The high temperature limit relation for the
parameters a, aB and HB with a  2 aBHB has been checked and
found to agree quite well within error. The values of fitting
parameters which describe the temperature dependence of
indirect gaps of ReS2 [14, 15], are listed for comparison.
4 Conclusion
The Au-doped ReS2 crystals can be easily pealed along the
crystal orientation of the b-axis via the auxiliary of weak
bonding between the individual Re chains. Hall effect
measurement shows p-type semiconducting behaviour for
the Au-doped ReS2 crystals. Temperature-dependent elec-
trical measurements show a marked increase in
conductivity and a large decrease in the activation energy,
indicating formation of a shallower impurity level in the
host lattice. The near band-edge temperature-dependent in-
plane anisotropic optical properties were studied by the
polarization-dependent PC measurements in the tempera-
ture range from 20 to 300 K. The study shows band gap
anisotropy with E k b polarization exhibiting a smaller
indirect gap than E ? b polarization.

was used to measure the detected signals. In PR measure-
ment, the built-in electric field is caused by photoexcited
electron-hole pairs created by a mechanically chopped 325
nm line 1 mW of the He–Cd laser. The modulating fre-
quency was set at 200 Hz. The entire data acquisition proce-
dure has been performed under computer control. Multiple
scans over a given photon energy range was programmed
until a desired signal-to-noise level has been attained. A
closed-cycle cryogenic refrigerator equipped with a digital
temperature controller was used for the low-temperature
measurements. For the high-temperature experiments, the
sample was mounted on one side of a copper finger of an
electrical heater, which enabled one to control and stabilize
the sample temperature. The temperature-dependent mea-
surements were made between 15 and 400 K with the tem-
perature stability of 0.5 K or better.

Zn1−x−yBexMgySe mixed crystals at 300 K. The solid curves

where Aj and  j are the amplitude and phase of the line-
shape, Ej and  j are the energy and broadening parameter of
the transitions, and the value of n depends on the origin of
transitions. For the first-derivative functional form, n=2 is
appropriate for excitonic transitions. The PR spectra at 300 K
show two distinct exciton resonances, denoted as E0 and
E0+0, as indicated by the vertical arrows in Fig. 1. Feature
E0 is the fundamental band gap and E0+0 related to spin-
orbit splitting. These features exhibit blueshifted character
with increasing Be and Mg contents. The values of E0 and
E0+0 obtained for samples A, B, and C are listed in Table
I. As shown in Table I, the split-off parameters 0 for
samples A, B, and C are determined to be 42510,
42210, and 42310 meV, respectively. This value is
similar to that of ZnSe20 and Zn1−xMgxSe x0.36 Ref.
21 showing the near independence of 0 on the kind of
cations.
Figure 2 shows the CER spectra at 15 K for samples A,
B, and C in the vicinity of fundamental transition regime.
The CER spectra at 15 K consist of two distinct features,
denoted as E0
n=1 and E0
n=2
, and indicated by vertical arrows,
where E0
n=1 and E0
n=2 are the ground state and the first excited
state of the band-edge excitonic transitions. The transition
energies of E0
n=1 and E0
n=2 at 15 K are determined to be
2.9250.003 and 2.9420.005 eV, 3.0960.003 and
3.1190.005 eV, and 3.1950.003 and 3.2200.005 eV
for samples A, B, and C, respectively. Using the hydrogenic
model, the binding energy of the band edge exciton was
determined to be 238, 318, and 338 meV, respec-
tively, for crystals A, B, and C. These values are compatible
with those obtained from the relation for exciton binding
energy of Zn1−xMgxSe thin films.21
A proper surface treatment of the sample must be per-
formed to eliminate the damaged layer formed on the surface
caused by mechanical polishing. The surface photovoltage
spectroscopy SPS technique can be utilized to check the
condition of the surface layer. The detailed technique of SPS
has been described in Ref. 22. Figure 3 shows the surface

where E00 is the energy at 0 K and  and 	 are constants.
The constant  is related to the electron exciton average
phonon interaction and 	 is closely related to the Debye
temperature.25
The temperature dependence of the band-edge excitonic
transition energies can also be described by a Bose

Einstein-type expression26
E0T = E00 − 2aB/expB/T − 1 , 3

The values obtained for E00, , and 	 from Varshni

also included in Table II.
The parameter  in Eq. 2 can be related to aB and B
in Eq. 3 by taking the high-temperature limit of both ex-
pressions, which yields to =2aB /B. Comparison of the
values presented in Table II shows that this relation is indeed
satisfied. From Eq. 3, it is straightforward to show that the
high temperature limit of the slope of E0T versus T curve
approaches the value of −2aB /B. The calculated values of
−2aB /B for E0 equals to −0.51, −0.53, and −0.57 meV /K
for samples A, B, and C respectively, which agree well with
the values of dE0 /dT=−0.52, −0.53, and −0.58 meV /K as
obtained from the linear extrapolation of the high-
temperature 200–400 K CER/PR experimental data.
The temperature-dependent experimental values of the
linewidth T of the band-edge exciton features obtained
from CER/PR measurements are displayed by the solid
circles, diamonds and squares in Fig. 6 for samples A, B, and

Initially, T increases linearly with T, but it begins to be
superlinear starting from about 150 K. The temperature de-
pendence of the linewidth of excitonic transitions of semi-
conductors can be expressed as31

tion of GaN.35 It has been shown theoretically that the
Fröhlich interaction is stronger for the higher ionicity II–VI
semiconducting crystals, comparing with that of the III–V
semiconducting crystals.36 Our results show no clear trend to
that effect and seem to indicate that other factors may con-
tribute to the electron exciton-LO phonon coupling con-
stant LO. In the case of GaN,35,37 it may be possible that a
larger deformation potential interaction may make a signifi-
cant contribution to LO in addition to the Fröhlich interac-
tion. The ionicity dependence of the Fröhlich interaction re-
quires further consideration and more work needs to be done
in this area.
IV. SUMMARY
In summary, a detailed study of near band-edge transi-
tions of three Bridgman-grown Zn1−x−yBexMgySe mixed
crystal samples have been carried out by CER/PR measure-
ments in the temperature range of 15–400 K. The band-edge
excitonic transition features in the CER/PR spectra show a
blueshift in the transition energy and a broadened linewidth
with the increase in Be/Mg contents. The temperature depen-
dence of the fundamental band gap has been analyzed by
both Varshni- and Bose–Einstein-type expressions. The pa-
rameters extracted from both expressions by extending into
the high temperature regime, were found to agree reasonably
well. The parameters that describe the temperature depen-
dence of the broadening function of the band edge excitonic
transitions have also been studied. The larger values of 0
for the Be/Mg containing mixed crystal samples is due
mainly to the poorer crystalline quality of the Be/Mg incor-
poration, indicating the difficulty of growing high-quality
Be/Mg incorporated II–VI quaternary crystals. The obtained
values for LO are comparable to those of most of the II–VI
and III–V semiconductors. Our results show no clear trend of
stronger Fröhlich interaction for the higher ionicity II–VI
semiconducting crystals comparing with that of the III–V
semiconducting crystals.

a thickness of about 10 m were used. Plate-shaped crys-
tals were selected and mounted on a copper sample holder.
Monochromatic light was provided by a 150 W tungsten-
halogen lamp that was filtered by a Photon Technology Inc.
0.25 m monochromator. Measurements of the reflectivity and
transmission at near-normal incidence configuration with
chopped light were carried out. For the polarization-
dependent measurements, Rochon prisms were employed.
The PzR measurements were achieved by gluing the thin
samples on a 0.15 cm thick lead zirconate titanate piezoelec-
tric transducer driven by a 200 Vrms sinusoidal source at 200
Hz. The alternating expansion and contraction of the trans-
ducer subjected the sample to an alternating strain with a
typical rms l / l value of 10−5. PR measurements were
achieved using an internally modulated 670 nm laser diode
serving as the pumping beam. Radiation from a 150 W
tungsten-halogen lamp filtered by a 0.25 m monochromator
provided the monochromatic light. The reflected light was
detected by a silicon photodetector. The dc output of the
photodetector was maintained constant by the servomecha-
nism of a variable neutral density filter. A dual-phase lock-in
amplifier was used to measure the detected signals. Multiple
scans over a given photon energy range was programed until
a desired signal-to-noise level has been attained with a com-
puter controlled data acquisition procedure. Detailed PzR
and PR configurations have been described elsewhere.17,20
For temperature-dependent measurement, a closed-cycle
cryogenic refrigerator equipped with a digital thermometer
controller was used for the low temperature measurements
with a temperature stability of 0.5 K or better.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The polarization-dependent transmittance measurements
at near-normal incidence were achieved to define the indirect
band-edge transitions of the ReSe2:Au. Taking into account
the spectral dependence of the reflectance, the absorption
coefficient  was determined from polarization-dependent

where Tr represents the transmission coefficient, R is the

the absorption coefficient of ReSe2:Au with photon energy
at several representative temperatures between 15 and 300 K
is presented in Fig. 1. The solid lines correspond to the E b
polarization and the dashed lines represent Eb polarization
for ReSe2:Au. Frequently observed for thin layered crystals,
the small oscillations below the absorption edge are attrib-
uted to interference effects.22 The polarization dependence of
the absorption curves provides conclusive evidence that the
two optical absorption edges are associated with interband
transitions from different origins. The polarization-dependent
experimental data analysis of the absorption coefficient 
shows an indirectly allowed transition for the investigated
materials.

sponds to Malus’ law observed also in polarization-

ReSe2 to fabricate a polarization sensitive photodetector ap-

the various orientations of linearly polarized light.13
The temperature-dependent PzR spectra of ReSe2:Au
with E b and Eb polarizations at various temperatures
between 15 and 300 K are shown in Fig. 6. The open-square
and open-circle curves are, respectively, the experimental
PzR spectra of E b and Eb polarizations, while the solid
curves are the least-squares fits to Eq. 3. As the general
property of most semiconductors, the excitonic transitions in
the PzR spectra exhibit a redshift and lineshape broadening
when the temperature is increased. The results in Fig. 6 show
that up to 175 K the higher order features of the excitonic
sequence are ionized. At a still higher temperature, full ion-
ization process renders the interband excitonic sequence un-
detectable. Up to 175 K the higher energy side feature E3ex
corresponding to the Eb polarization is practically ion-

tions of ReSe2:Au. The obtained values of these quantities
are listed in Table II together with the numbers for undoped
ReSe2 determined by PzR.9
The values of the parameters which describe the tem-
perature dependence of the broadening function of the exci-
tonic transitions of ReSe2:Au are comparable to those of
undoped ReSe2. The values for the coupling constants 	1LO
and 	2LO for ReSe2:Au are in the range of 60–75 meV,
which are considerably larger than those reported for a num-
ber of semiconductors, such as GaAs 20 meV Ref. 27
and ZnSe 24 meV.28 We assumed that the large values
of 	LO may be the general characteristics of crystals with
layer structure but still more systematic investigation should
be carried out to verify this property.
IV. SUMMARY
The effects of gold dopant on the optical properties of
ReSe2 were studied. The results indicate that incorporation of
Au into the host lattice ReSe2 can cause a small redshift in
the indirect energy gap of the sample as determined from the
transmittance spectra. The PzR and PR spectra strongly re-
veal polarization-dependent E1
ex feature at E b polarization;
two features E2
ex and E3
ex were observed at Eb polarization
as well, which is different from the isostructural compound
ReS2, where only E1
ex and E2
ex features were detected. The
angular dependence of the excitonic feature amplitudes
shows a sinusoidal variation with respect to the angular
change in the linearly polarized light that corresponds to
Malus’ law. The direct band-edge excitonic transition ener-
gies E1
ex and E2
ex of ReSe2:Au single crystals obtained by
PzR measurements remain practically unchanged in com-
parison with undoped ReSe2. Nevertheless the doping effect
shows up in a slight increase in the broadening parameter of
the excitonic features.

piezoreﬂectance (PzR) measurements. Temperature-dependent
(15–300K) PzR measurements were carried out for undoped and
Au-doped WS2 to detect the possible distinction in the spectral
features of the excitonic transitions, namely A, B, d, and C. The
parameters which describe the temperature behaviour of excitonic
transitions indicate that A–B and d–C excitonic pairs, caused by
interlayer interaction and spin–orbit splitting, correspond to exci-
tonic transitionswith different origins. The effects of dopant on the
optical properties are analyzed and discussed.
2. Experimental
Single crystals ofWS2:Auwere grown by the chemical vapour transportmethod
using I2 as a transport agent. The weight of doping material was determined stoi-
chiometrically to obtain the small concentration of dopant, i.e. 50mg of Au on about
10g of the total charge weight. Single crystalline platelets up to 10mm×5mm sur-
face area and 0.5mm thickness were obtained. Hall-effect measurements indicate
that the Au-doped sample is p-type in nature. At room temperature, the carrier
concentration is 3×1018 cm−3 and the Hall mobility corresponds to 18 cm2 V−1 s−1.
The crystal structureofundopedandAu-dopedWS2 single crystalswasanalyzed
using Rigaku RTP300RC X-ray diffractometer with Cu K radiation (=1.5418 A˚).
For X-ray studies, several small crystals were ﬁnely ground with a mixture of glass
powder, and the X-ray powder patterns were recorded by means of a slow-moving
radiation. CuK radiationwas employed and a silicon standardwas used to calibrate
thediffractometer. The latticeparameterswere calculatedwith theaidof a computer
using a least squares reﬁnement program.
In SPV measurements, the photovoltage was measured between the sample
and a reference metal grid electrode in a capacitive manner as a function of the
photon energy of the probe beam. The illumination system consisted of a 150W
tungsten–halogen lamp chopped at 200Hz and a 0.25m grating monochromator.
A beam splitter was placed in the path of the incident light. The intensity of the
incident beam was monitored by a pyroelectric detector and was maintained at a
constant level of ∼10−5 Wcm−2 by a stepping motor connected to a variable neutral
density ﬁlter, which was also placed in the path of the incident beam. The photo-
voltage spectrum on themetal gridwasmeasuredwith a copper plate as the ground
electrode, using a buffer circuit and a lock-in ampliﬁer. For the PC measurements,
selected samples were cut into rectangular shape. The PC spectra were recorded
on a standard experimental set-up with chopped light beam incident onto the basal
plane of the crystals. Good ohmic contacts to the crystal were facilitated bymeans of
two gold wires laid across the VdW surface of the crystal and attached to the crystal
surface by highly conducting silver epoxy. Phase sensitive detection technique was
used to measure the PC signals at room temperature.
The PzR measurements were achieved by gluing the thin single-crystal speci-
mens on a 0.15 cm thick lead zirconate titanate piezoelectric transducer driven by
a 200Vrms sinusoidal wave at 200Hz. A 150W xenon arc lamp ﬁltered by a 0.25m
grating monochromator provided the monochromatic light. The reﬂected light was
detected by an UV-enhanced silicon photodiode, and the signal was recorded from
a lock-in ampliﬁer. A closed-circle cryogenic refrigerator equipped with a digital
thermometer controller was used for low-temperature measurements. The mea-
surements were made between 15 and 300K with a temperature stability of 0.5K
or better.
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1 shows the X-ray powder diffraction patterns for undoped
and Au-doped WS2 samples, respectively. The XRD pattern of Au-
doped WS2 crystals (Fig. 1(b)) differs from the undoped WS2
(Fig. 1(a)). The peak positions and intensities of the XRD pattern
of undoped WS2 crystals correspond to the hexagonal phase while
forWS2:Au the XRDpatterns show amixture of hexagonal (marked
with an H upon the peaks associated with 2H polytype in Fig. 1(b))
and rhombohedral phases. It should be noted that for 3R-polytype
a lattice parameter (3.1581 A˚) is closed to the 2H-polytypic one
(a=3.154 A˚) while the c lattice parameter of magnitude 18.491 A˚
is about 1.5 larger than the hexagonal c value (12.323 A˚) [4]. The
change in relative line intensities is the result of a different crys-
tal quality of 2H-WS2 to that of the mixed 3R- and 2H-polytypes
WS2:Au single crystals. The rocking curves for the features of 3R-
(015) and (018) illustrated in Fig. 1(c) show a full width at half
maximum (FWHM) of 0.85◦ and 0.33◦, respectively. Large FWHM
values may also be related to the formation of mixed 3R- and 2H-
polytypes of the gold-doped WS2 crystals.

cates the presence of a well known excitonic feature A at ∼1.96 eV
near the direct band gap Edg of WS2:Au as well as interference
induced oscillations on the lower energy side (below 1.9 eV). A
band-gap-related feature A at ∼1.96 eV has also been observed in
SPV and PC spectra. In the sub-band-gap energy range for both
SPV and PC spectra, an additional feature X located at ∼1.9 eV

following notations of Wilson and Yoffe [1] and Beal and Knights
[2]. For undoped 2H-WS2, the Rydberg series of A exciton can be
described by three-dimensional Mott–Wannier exciton model [35]
which predicts that the intensity of the discrete excitonic transi-
tion falls off as n−3. The direct band gap Eg and the binding energy
of the A exciton series for pure WS2 at 15K are estimated to be
2.119±0.002eV and 52±2meV, respectively [36]. For Au-doped
WS2, only the ground state (n=1) of the A exciton is observed.
The excitonic series can be more appropriately described by the
two-dimensional Mott–Wannier excitonsmodel with the intensity
fallen as (2n−1)−3 [35]. Themuch broader linewidth of the ground
state of the A exciton and a more severe intensity degradation pre-
vent the observation of the higher series. It is also noted that the
red-shift rate of A and B excitons is higher than that of d and C
excitons as temperature increased.
The temperature variations of the energies of A, B, d and C exci-
tons forundopedandAu-dopedWS2 are shown inFig. 4. Thedashed

tionandˇi is closely related to theDebye temperature. Theobtained

Au-doped WS2 are listed in Table 1. The values of the A and B exci-

(exciton)–phonon interaction for A–B are about two times larger
than that of d–C excitonic pairs. These results indicate that A–B and
d–C excitonic pairs correspond to excitonic transitions with differ-
ent origins. From the recent theoretical and experimental studies
[14–16], the A and B peaks near the absorption edge correspond
to the smallest direct transitions at the K point while the d and C
excitons are attributed to the direct transitions of the  point of the
Brillouin zone. The A and B excitons belong respectively to K4 →K5
and K1 →K5 optical transitions originating from interlayer interac-
tions and spin–orbit splitting of the valance band at theKpoint. The
K states have been shown to be predominantly metal d states with
a small contribution from the nonmetal p states. According to the
band structure calculations, in the absenceof spin–orbit interaction
 −4 →  +5 is the only allowed transition from top of the valance
band to conduction band [15,16]. The  +5 →  +9 +  +8 spin–orbit
splitting of the conduction band level due to the metal d and non-
metal p contributions to the wave functions have different signs,
and the metal d contribution to these states is rather small. As a
result, the d and C exciton peaks can be prescribed, respectively, as
 −4 →  +8 and  −4 →  +9 optical transitions.
The experimental values of  i(T) of the A and B excitons at
several temperatures between 15 and 300K as obtained from the
line shape ﬁt with Eq. (1) for Au-doped and undoped WS2 are dis-
played in Fig. 5. The temperature dependence of the broadening
parameters of semiconductors can be expressed as [39,40]:
i(T) = i0 +
iLO
exp(iLO/T) − 1
, (4)
where i=Aor B. Theﬁrst term iLO of Eq. (4) represent the broaden-
ing contribution of temperature independent mechanisms, such as
electron–electron interaction, impurity, dislocation, electron inter-
action and alloy scattering, whereas the second term is caused
by the electron (exciton)–LO phonon (Fro¨hlich) interaction. The
quantity  iLO represents the strength of the electron (exciton)–LO
phonon couplingwhile  iLO is the LO phonon temperature [39,40].
The solid curves in Fig. 5 are least squares ﬁts to Eq. (4), which
made it possible to evaluate  i0,  iLO and iLO for the A and B
excitonic transitions of Au-doped and undoped WS2. The obtained
values are presented in Table 2 together with the number for Re-
doped WS2 [36]. The larger value of  i0 for the doped (Au or Re)
WS2 compounds is mainly due to impurity scattering. According to
the previous report of Raman measurements [41], the ﬁtted values
of iLO are quite close to the longitudinal optical phonon tempera-
tures for WS2 (515K). This close match between the values of iLO
and the LO phonon temperatures obtained from Raman scatter-

I. INTRODUCTION
Wide gap II-VI ternary and quaternary solid solutions
are currently under intensive investigation for their pos-
sible applications in constructing light emitters, pho-
todetectors and other electrooptical devices operating
in wide spectral region from deep ultraviolet to near-
infrared. Because the energy gap of binary II-VI com-
pounds, which do not contain mercury, can be var-
ied from 1.5 eV (CdTe) to 5.5 eV (BeSe), by mix-
ing of dierent binary compounds, one can tune the
band-gap energy and the lattice constant over a wide
range for matching to dierent substrates. The mixed
crystals, Zn

and BeCdSe/ZnMgCdSe quantum-well heterostructures,
which are lattice matched to InP and are very promis-
ing for construction of visible light emiters [1,2], Bragg
reectors [3] and photodetectors. Visible-blind ultravio-
let detectors based on ZnMgBeSe [4] have already been
demonstrated. Although a large number of articles con-

papers concerning the mechanisms of the luminescence
processes in these mixed crystals have been published [5{

In mixed ternary and quaternary semiconductors, sta-
tistical uctuations of microscopic concentrations of par-
ticular components are known to be always present.
This compositional disorder causes local potential uc-
tuations, leading to a smearing of the sharp edges of the
density of states [8,9]. The modied potential proles no-
ticeably aect the motion of excitons and carriers and,
thus, inuence the photoelectric properties and radia-
tive recombination processes in these materials. In such
compounds, localization of excited carriers leading to a
creation of localized excitons may occur at low temper-
atures [8{10]. A luminescence associated with exciton
localization was observed in several II VI ternary and
quaternary solid solutions with common cations and an-
ions such as BeCdSe [11], HgCdTe [12,13], ZnSeTe [14],
ZnMgCdSe [7], CdSSe [9, 11, 15], ZnCdSe [16] and Cd-
MgSe [6].

due to impurities and native defects [9,10].
The presented experimental results (see Figure 2)
indicate that in crystals with high Mg contents, e.g.
Zn
0:46
Mg
0:54
Se, the photoluminescence at T = 40 K is
mainly due to radiative recombination of excitons local-
ized in the potential wells. At temperatures from the
range 80 { 100 K a signicant increasing the full-width at
half maximum of this luminescence line is observed which
supports the conclusion that at this temperature, the ra-
diative recombination from delocalized excitons starts to
appear. For the Zn
0:46
Mg
0:54
Se crystal, at temperatures
higher than about 120 K, an intensive delocalization of
excitons takes place and, as a result, the luminescence
from delocalized extended states is observed. At the
same time, an energy migration, due to exciton delocal-
ization and dissociation, starts to occur, leading to the
appearance of other radiative and nonradiative recombi-
nation channels. As a result of such processes, the in-
tensity of the luminescence due to the radiative recombi-
nation through deep levels increases and is accompanied
by a drastic decrease in the intensity of exciton emission.
This is clearly observed for Zn
1 x
Mg
x
Se with high mag-
nesium content and is presented in Figures 2 and 6. The
localization of excitons noticeably reduces the migration
of excitation energy to other radiative and nonradiative
recombination centers [10]. One of the consequences of
such a process can be a signicant suppression or even
a complete removal of the others, than those due to re-
combination of localized excitons, luminescence bands,
such as associated with free-to-bound or bound-to-bound
transitions. This can explain the observation that with
the increasing Mg content, the relative intensities of ex-
citon lines at low temperatures increase as compared to
those of edge and deep level emission bands. The shift in
the excitonic feature in reectivity spectrum as compared
to that in the PL spectrum observed for Zn

low donor-acceptor pairs and deep levels emission bands.
The relative intensity of the exciton line compared to
that of the edge and deep levels emission, increases with

The results of detailed investigations of the temperature
dependence of the luminescence can be explained if one
takes into account that the statistical uctuations of the
local composition in solid solutions cause spatial poten-
tial uctuations, leading at low temperatures to localiza-
tion of excited carriers that form localized excitons. The
high eciency of near band-edge photoluminescence at
low temperatures can be explained as being due to a ra-
diative recombination of localized excitons. The notice-
able decrease in the intensity of this emission at higher
temperatures is due to dissociation of excitons and to
migration of excited carriers with their subsequent re-
combination through other than excitonic, radiative and
nonradiative recombination paths.

mixed-crystal samples grown by using the modied high pressure Bridgman method has been carried
out via photoluminescence (PL), contactless electroreectance (CER) and photoreectance (PR) in
the temperature range of 15 to 400 K. PL spectra at low temperatures consist of an exciton line,
a broader emission band due to recombination of donor-acceptor pairs and a broad band related
to recombination through deep-level defects. Interband transitions, originating from the band edge
and spin-orbit splitting critical points, have been observed in the CER/PR spectra. The optical
properties of these two mixed crystals are compared and the results indicate the superior quality of
the Be-incorporated mixed quaternary crystals. The peak positions of the excitonic emission lines
in the PL spectra correspond quite well to the energies of the fundamental transitions obtained by
means of electromodulation data. The parameters that describe the temperature dependence of the
fundamental and spin split-o band gaps and the broadening function of the band-edge excitons
are evaluated and discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION
Among the wide-gap II-VI semiconductors, mixed
crystals of Mg, Be, Zn and Cd chalcogenides are of spe-
cial interest because of their applications in constructing
devices operating in the visible and the UV spectral re-
gions [1]. The pioneering work by Okuyama et al. [2]
demonstrated that thin lms of Zn

One of the key problems in manufacturing long-lived
devices is their mechanical stability, in particular, the
resistance to formation of various point and planar de-
fects, which can impede laser action. Be-chalcogenide-
containing semiconductor alloys have been proposed for
improving the performance of ZnSe-based blue-green
lasers [5]. From a theoretical consideration [6], the pres-
ence of strong covalent bonding and high cohesive energy
in the Be-based chalcogenides can be used to enhance
the crystal elastic rigidity in II-VI alloys. Be incorpo-
ration is expected to lead to bond strengthening within
the II-VI lattice and to increase the energy of stacking-
fault formation, thus reducing defect propagation [7].
Among the Be-based II-VI compound semiconductors,

of the potential applications, very little work has been
done on these ternary and quaternary compounds.

Se mixed-crystal samples have
been investigated by using temperature-dependent PL
and CER/PR measurements in the temperature range
of 15 to 400 K. PL spectra at low temperatures consist
of an exciton line, a broader emission band due to re-
combination of donor-acceptor pairs and a broad band
related to recombination through deep-level defects. In-
terband transitions, originating from the band edge and
spin-orbit splitting critical points, have been observed in
the CER/PR spectra. The relative intensity of the exci-
ton line as measured by using PL for the Be-containing
quarternary sample is more intense than that of the
ternary samples containing only Mg. Moreover, for the
low-temperature CER spectra, well-resolved Rydberg's
series with n = 1 and 2 can be clearly observed for Be-
containing mixed-crystals while only a single feature is
observed for Mg-containing samples. This comparative
study indicates the superior quality of Be-incorporated
mixed quaternary crystals.

I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, ZnSe-based diluted magnetic semicon-
ductors obtained by alloying with beryllium and man-
ganese chalcogenides have received great attention for
their potential applications in magnetoelectronics [1].
The quaternary ZnBeMnSe mixed crystals are partic-
ularly interesting because the partial substitution of Be
for Zn allows control of the material structure and the
band parameters and may stabilize the sphalerite crystal
structure. The Mn ions inuence the magnetic proper-
ties of the mixed crystals. However, to date, there is little
published data on quaternary diluted magnetic semicon-
ductor thin layers [2] and bulk crystals [3,4].
In this work, we report an investigation of the tem-
perature dependence of the near-band-edge transitions of

j
and  
j
are the energy and the broadening
parameter of the transitions and the value of n depends
on the origin of the transitions. For the rst derivative
functional form, n = 2 is appropriate for excitonic tran-
sitions. For M
0
-type three-dimensional critical-point in-
terband transitions, n = 0.5 is appropriate [13]. Our
experimental data have a better t with n = 0.5. We
emphasize, however, that the transition energies ex-
tracted from such ts are relatively insensitive to the
lineshape function. The anomaly of the tting results
may be related to the peculiar step-like shape around
the E
0
feature of the CER spectra. This kind of line-
shape is not common for CER experiments. At this mo-
ment, the physical origin of this lineshape is not clear
and the authors think that this may be related to ex-
citons bound to local compositional uctuations, which
are always present in Be/Mn-containing quaternary com-
pounds. This argument is supported by (a) the reduc-
tion of the step-like shape (Figures 2(a) and (b)) at high
temperatures as the temperature increases, the exciton
is not bound anymore and (b) the fact that this step-like
line-shape is not observed in other II-VI wide-band-gap
materials with better compositional uniformity, such as
ZnO [15].

are 2.886  0.003 and 2.904  0.003
eV, respectively. The binding energy of the band-edge
exciton, R, is determined, using the hydrogenic model,
to be 24  6 meV. As the temperature increases, the
CER spectral features shift towards lower energies and
broaden. The two features are not clearly resolved at
temperatures higher than 150 K. We, therefore, tted the
spectra with only one feature, denoted as E
0
, at higher
temperatures. The tted value of the transition energy
at 300 K is 2.751  0.005 eV. For Zn

t of the spectrum with only one feature denoted as
E
0
and the transition energy is 2.905  0.003 eV. The
larger imhomogeneous broadening due to alloy disorder
for higher Mn contents prevents the observation of higher
excitonic transitions. As the temperature increases, the
CER spectral feature exhibits a red shift. The value of
the transition energy derived from the tting procedure
at 300 K is 2.752  0.006 eV.

in Figure 3, the typical SPS spectrum has a step-like
shape, a character of excitonic transitions, around the

the rst derivative of the surface photovoltage signal

well. It is noticed that the peak positions of the band-
edge exciton features in the PL spectra correspond quite
well (at slightly lower energy) to the fundamental transi-
tion energies obtained from the CER and the SPS data.
The temperature dependence of the band-edge exci-

Se mixed crystal samples, grown with
the modied Bridgman method, have been carried out
by using temperature-dependent PL, CER and SPS mea-
surements in the range of 15 to 300 K. PL spectra at low
temperatures consist of an exciton line, an edge emission
due to recombination of shallow donor-acceptor pairs
and Mn
2+
-related intra-ionic emissions. Near-band-edge
transitions have been observed in the CER and the SPS
spectra. For the low-temperature CER spectra, a well-
resolved Rydberg series with n = 1 and 2 can be clearly
observed for a lower Mn-containing quaternary mixed
crystal while only a single feature is observed for the
higher Mn-containing sample due to larger alloy disor-
der. The SPS spectrum shows a step-like shape around
E
0
transitions. The transition energies are determined
by tting the numerical derivative of the SPS spectra
with respect to photon energy to the rst derivative of a
Lorentzian lineshape function. The peak positions of the
exciton emission lines in the PL spectra correspond quite
well to the energies of the fundamental transitions deter-
mined from the CER and the SPS data. The parameters
that describe the temperature dependence of the funda-
mental band gap were evaluated and discussed.
