Abstract 
 
We propose a new architecture of 
Chinese abacus adder. As high radix of adder 
may reduce the number of carry propagation, 
the proposed Chinese abacus adder may 
achieve high-speed operation. The simulation 
results of our work are compared with CLA 
(Carry Look-ahead) adder. The delay of the 
8-bit abacus adders are 22%, 17%, and 14% 
less than those of CLA adders for 0.35μm, 
0.25μm, and 0.18μm technologies, 
respectively. The power consumption of the 
abacus adders are 30%, 34%, and 60% less 
than those of CLA adders for 0.35μm, 
0.25μm, and 0.18μm technologies, 
respectively. The use of Chinese abacus 
approach results a competitive technique 
with respect to conventional fast adder.

二、計畫緣由與目的 
 
The first novel digital arithmetic circuits 
employing the method of the Chinese abacus 
were proposed by Gang et al. [1-3]. The 
architecture of radix-4 abacus adder is shown 
in [1]. The architecture of radix-2 abacus 
adder is shown in [2] and [3]. However, the 
Gang’s method designed in radix-4 could be 
improved as the series connections of SU 
module. It will induce more than nine pass 
transistor chains and the transition time of 
the signal waveform will become excessively 
long [4]. Higher radix addition may decrease 
both the propagation time and the number of 
carries [5]. A basic column element of the 
Chinese abacus is depicted in figure 1(a). 
The configuration showed in figure 1(a) 
represents the number six. Each column 
element has one higher bead with a weight of 
five and four lower beads with a weight of 
one. The key feature of the Chinese abacus is 
the use of one bead with weight five. This 
allows the operator to minimize the 
transmission of rests.

base 10 of the decimal number 6, (b) the 
proposed Chinese abacus adder coding with 
base 16 of the decimal number 9. 
 
In this paper, each basic column element 
of this abacus adder has three lower beads 
with a weight of one and three higher beads 
with a weight of four. The basic element is 
able to represent decimal numbers in the 
range from 0 to 15 as depicted in figure 1(a). 
augend B (H2BH1BH0B) = 011 will activate 
the segment of figure 3(b). The thermometric 
sum (K5K4K3K2K1K0) will be (011111).  
The detail circuits of P/A module as 
depicted in figure 3 are derived from the 
equations (3)–(18). The proposed P/A 
module can count all beads simultaneously.  
Gang’s abacus adder count each bead one 
after one. This is the reason why it needs 3S 
to serially count three lower beads, SU to 
count carry, then 2S to count higher beads in 
figure 7[1], respectively. There are nine pass 
transistor chains in series connection, one in 
T/A, three in 3S, one in SU, one in T/A, two 
in 2S and one in A/B, respectively. Gang’s 
radix-4 abacus adder consumes more delay 
as the serial connection of pass transistor 
chains [4].

waveform. The simulation results of both 
adders are listed in Table I and Table II for 
various technologies and Table III for 
various adder comparisons. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
TABLE III The worst case delay & transistor count of conventional 
adder 
 
The delay is the longest time of all input 
patterns. The delay of the 8-bit abacus 
adders are 22%, 17%, and 14% less than 
those of CLA adders for 0.35μm, 0.25μm, 
and 0.18μm technologies, respectively. 
While the bit number increases, the delay 
may decrease more effectively. The delay of 
abacus adder may be modeled as tN-bit delay = 
[(N/8)-1]*tTG + t8-bit delay, while tN-bit delay, tTG, 
and t8-bit delay are the delay of N-bit abacus 
adder, transmission gate, and 8-bit abacus 
adder, respectively.  
The power consumption of 8-bit adders is 
also listed in Table II that shows the average 
results of all input patterns. The power 
consumption of the abacus adders are 30%, 
34%, and 60% less than those of CLA adders 
for 0.35μm, 0.25μm, and 0.18μm 
technologies, respectively.  
The product of power and delay of the 
abacus adders are 45%, 45%, and 65% less 
than those of CLA adders for 0.35μm, 
0.25μm, and 0.18μm technologies, 
respectively. From these results, we can 
expect that abacus adder will remain 
competitive with the CLA adder.
