deliver higher strength, as predicted by Hall-Petch 
relationship.[6] If there is one particle for one grain 
boundary, the amount of the second phase particles is 
a function of the (particle(d)/matrix grain(G)) size 
ratio. As the ratio is unity, the volume fraction of the 
second phase is nearly 50%. Though the 
microstructure is very stable at elevated 
temperature,[7] the sintering of such composite may 
also be difficult. By reducing the size ratio, the 
volume fraction can be significantly reduced.  
However, one should note that there are 
limits for such amount/size reduction. The amount of 
the second phase should be at least higher than the 
solubility of the second phase. Furthermore, the size 
of the second phase particles should be large enough 
to avoid the particles to separate from the grain 
boundary. Both the grain boundary and particle can 
move during sintering. Their separation takes place 
as the grain growth rate, vb, is much faster than that 
of the velocity of particle, vp, as  
 
! 
vb > vp    (1) 
By adopting the relationship to estimate the 
force on isolated pore,[8] the criteria for the separation 
to take place is estimated as[9]

where D* is diffusion coefficient across the grain 
boundary, Deff the effective diffusion coefficient of the 
mass to move within the particle or at the interface, n 
a constant depending on the mechanism and Ω the 
volume of controlling ions. The above equation 
suggests that the separation is taking place as the 
particles are too small, or the grains too large. There 
is a limit for the particle/grain size ratio.  
 
三. 實驗步驟 
 
Three systems, ZrO2/Al2O3, Al2O3/ZrO2 and 
Al2O3/Ni composites are prepared in the present 
study to verify the points above. The specimens are 
all prepared by pressureless sintering. The amount of 
the second phase varies from 0.03 to 0.21 vol.% for 
the Al2O3/Ni composites and from 1 to 5 vol.% for 
the ZrO2/Al2O3 and Al2O3/ZrO2 composites. The size 
ratio between particle and grain for the ZrO2/Al2O3, 
Al2O3/ZrO2 and Al2O3/Ni composites is around 1, 
0.1 and 0.05, respectively. The relative density of 
the composites are all higher than 99%, indicating 
the addition of an amount less than 5 vol.% has little 
influence on the sintering activity.  
 In the present study, three systems with 
different amount/size ratios were prepared. The 
ZrO2/Al2O3 and Al2O3/ZrO2 composite systems were 
prepared by mixing Al2O3 and ZrO2 powders together 
by ball milling in alcohol for 4 h. The powder 
compacts were formed by die-pressing. The 
pressureless sintering was carried out at 1600°C for 
1h. The Al2O3-Ni powder mixtures were prepared by 
milling Al2O3 powder with various amounts of 
nickel nitrate solution. The powders were washed 
with distilled water to remove extra nitrate. The 
specimens were also sintered at 1600°C for 1h, 
except a graphite powder bed was used. The surface 
of the sintered specimens was ground with diamond 
grinding wheel. Monolithic ZrO2 and Al2O3 
specimens are also prepared for comparison. The 
strength and toughness were determined with 4-point 
flexural and single-edge-notched-beam techniques, 
respectively.  
 
四. 結果與討論 
 
As the particle size is close to that of matrix 
grains (for the ZrO2/Al2O3 composites), the number of 
particles is too small to prohibit the movement of 
every grain boundary (Fig. 3). As the size of particles 
is reduced (for the Al2O3/ZrO2 and Al2O3/Ni 
composites), then the matrix grains are significantly 
refined; and, the coalescence of the ZrO2 particles or 
Ni particles in the composites is limited. As 
predicted by the Eq.(2), either the particle is too 
small, or the matrix grain is too large, the separation 
between the particles and grain boundary can still 
take place. For example, the separations can be found 
in the Al2O3/1%ZrO2 composites, some large grains 
remain after sintering.  
For the Al2O3-Ni composites, an amount of 
0.03 vol.% Ni is close to its solubility in Al2O3.[10] 
The Ni content has to be higher than 0.1 vol.% to 
achieve strength increase. Though the size of Ni 
particles is smaller than that of ZrO2 particles (in the 
Al2O3 matrix), the separation is seldom observed in 
the Al2O3-Ni composites. It indicates that the fine Ni 
particles are much effective to prohibit the growth of 
Al2O3 grains. It may due to that the bonding 
characteristic of Ni is very much different from that of 
Al2O3, the Ni particle prefers to stick to the grain 
boundary.  
The strength of the ZrO2 is not increased by 
adding ≤ 5 vol.% Al2O3. (Fig. 4). For the Al2O3-
matrix composites, the strength of Al2O3 increases 
with the increase of the particle content. The 
strengthening effect can be related to their refined 
microstructure. Though the ZrO2 or Ni content is 
very low, as long as their amount and size are above 
the criteria, very fine particles affect most grain 
boundaries, as demonstrated by the strength increase.  
The toughness of Al2O3 increases with the 
increase of ZrO2 content, though the enhancement is 
rather marginal (Fig. 5). The amount of monoclinic 
phase on the fracture surface increases with the 
increase of ZrO2 content, indicating that the 
toughness increase can be related to the 
transformation toughening.[2] The toughness of Al2O3 
is enhanced as ≥ 0.1 vol.% Ni is added. The interface 
between Al2O3 and Ni is relatively weak.[4] The

來的YSZ/Al2O3複合材料, 在1600K的強度可達0 .87GPa, 而YAG/Al2O3更可高達 
1.7GPa, 因為這些數據是目前筆者所知的最高數據, 再加上此材料為氧化物, 所
以完全沒有氧化的問題, 故具有極高的高溫的應用潛力.  
 
可能正是因方向凝固共晶陶瓷複合材料擁有不容忽視的高溫性質, 日本的
UBE公司也投入大量經費於此領域, UBE的研究中心的Ishikawa博士也報導他們對
YAG/Al2O3複合材料的研究, 他們除了塊材也探討以 DSO方式製作纖維的可行性, 
日本公司的投入, 代表此材料具商業價值, 且Ishhikawa 博士曾有兩篇論文在
Nature上發表, 顯示UBE公司的研究中心具有極強的研發實力, 能整合基本學理, 
繼而發展成商品, 故這方面的發展及應用值得密切觀察. 但DSO材料仍有韌性偏
低的問題 (由UBE公司的 Dr.Waku 報告時指出), 故DSO共晶陶瓷複合材料仍有待
突破的地方.  
 
德國的FCT公司的研究員Dr. Berroth 展示他們在氮化矽方面的紮實製造能力，
FCT公司雖僅有40人，卻能從製造陶瓷大型產品到製造真空燒結設備，皆有突出
的表現，Dr. Berroth展示他們可製作長500mm, 寬100mm的氮化矽產品，他們的一隻
大型浸入式加熱棒的單價可達3000美金, 顯示紮實的技術，才是獲利的保證，他
的報告吸引大多數人的讚嘆。 
 
來自NASA的DiCarlo博士報告他們使用陶瓷材料於太空材料上的經驗，他指出
NASA評估所有商用陶瓷纖維，並發展出許多可用在太空梭上的零件，其中尤其
在太空梭的隔熱磚投入心力最大，但他指出NASA雖擁有全世界最好的高溫測試
及評估設備，但NASA自己不製造陶瓷纖維，NASA做的是系統整合，筆者在他演
講完後第二天早上與他一起用早餐，他又說出目前美國幾家在製造陶瓷纖維的公
司通通沒有賺錢，但仍不願放棄此一市場，而他們的研究及開發經費則完全向美
國政府要，而美國政府為了保有在太空科技領先的目的，對這些公司的要求，也
都是有求必應，這種 [產-官-學-研] 的互動，頗值得深思。 
 
NASA不做材料開發，但美國空軍實驗室則投入大量資源去做，美國空軍的
Mike Cinibulk 博士則報告多種複合材料的機械性質, 他們發現以氧化物纖維(如
Nextel系統)可大幅提升多種材料的強度及韌性，氮氧化物纖維表面預處理，如被
覆另一氧化物，則是最關鍵的技術。 
 
筆者此次以陶瓷複合材料的設計為題發表邀請演講, 獲得不錯迴響, 成功大
學黃肇瑞教授發表兩篇演講, 討論也很熱烈.
