I、 A Wideband CPW-fed Two-Arm 
Spiral Slot Antenna 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Conventional Archimedean spiral 
antennas have the advantages of broadband 
characteristic, good circular polarization and 
superior radiation [1-5]. Generally, two-arm 
Archimedean spiral antennas are fed from the 
outer by the balun that the currents are of equal 
amplitude and with 180 degrees out of phase 
[3-4]. But, the wideband balun circuit of equal 
amplitude and 180° phase difference was 
difficultly designed and the total antenna size 
was increased with adding the balun circuit. In 
order to obtain wider bandwidth of axial ratio, a 
circular aperture on the ground plane was 
proposed [5]. Though the wide bandwidth of 
axial ratio was successful designed, the spiral 
antenna with feeding of in-phase was increased 
100% size of the common spiral with feeding of 
equal amplitude and 180 degree out of phase. 
Because of the advantages of low radiation loss, 
less dispersion in comparison to a microstrip 
feed and easy combination with of MIC/MMIC 
modules for the design of active-integrated 
antennas, the CPW-fed slot antennas have 
attracted more attention recently [6,7]. 
 
2. ANTENNA DESIGN 
In our test, the CPW-fed two-arm spiral 
slot antenna was designed and fabricated on 
high-frequency FR4 substrate, with a dielectric 
constant of 4.4 and the substrate thickness of 
1.6mm. The spiral slot width s = 0.6mm, the 
ground width w = 2.2mm, the turn number and 
the maximum radius r  = 34 mm were 
determined, respectively.

Figure 1 presents a schematic diagram of 
the proposed CPW-fed two-arm spiral slot 
antenna. The both out-of-phase slot lines are fed 
into the spiral slot antenna. The angles of two arc 
slot lines at the feeding network are modified to 
obtain better impedance matching condition. 
Previous studies of the Archimedean spiral 
antenna [1-2] were employed in our experiment 
to derive the radius for the CPW-fed two-arm 
spiral slot antenna. In order to derive details of 
the CPW-fed spiral slot antenna, we changed the 
number of turns, ground width w separated 
between two neighboring turns and the slot 
width.   
 
3. RESULTS 
Figure 2 illustrates the comparison of the 
simulated and measured reflection coefficients 
of the CPW-fed two-arm spiral slot antenna. 
From the measured results, the impedance 
bandwidth of the antenna covered most of the 
commercial wireless communication systems.  
The effects of the operating frequency on 
the reflection coefficients for the antenna with 
different turn numbers are presented in Figure 3. 
According to the experimental results, the initial 
resonant frequency was improved to achieve 
good impedance matching by increasing the turn 
numbers. Figure 4 shows the variations of the 
operating frequency on the reflection 
coefficients for different ground width 
separation w between two neighboring turns 
when the spiral slot width s and the turn numbers 
are fixed. It is clearly found that the reflection 
coefficients were improved with increasing the 
ground width w.  The reason may be that the 
characteristic impedance of the CPW 
transmission line was decreased as increasing 
 4
2.  ANTENNA DESIGN 
 Figure 6 shows the geometry of the 
proposed simple GPS/DCS monopole antenna 
with CP operation.  The proposed antenna 
mainly consists of a monopole and one sleeve, 
and is printed on an FR4 microwave substrate 
with thickness 1.6 mm and relatively 
permittivity 4.4.  A 50-ΩCPW feed line, having 
a signal strip of width Wf and a gap of width of S, 
is used to excite the antenna.  Impedance 
matching is optimized by cutting the copper 
ground plane. The C-like monopole is centrally 
placed at the end of the CPW feed line and 
designed to be operated at 1.8 GHz.  Similarly 
to the design of adding a shorted parasitic wire 
[14], the one inverted-L sleeve is the extension 
of the ground plane and has the dimensions of a 
horizontal length 9 mm and a vertical length 25 
mm (L1). The emphasis in the sleeve monopole 
design is not only directed towards the 
improvement of the impedance characteristics of 
the antenna by adjusting the sleeve and radiator 
dimensions [15], but the surface current density 
and the radiation pattern are also influenced.  
At the GPS band, the monopole and the 
inverted-L sleeve can be treated as the rhombic 
hula hoop [16], and the proposed antenna can 
have a traveling wave type current distribution 
on the loop, which has approximately a constant 
amplitude and linearly changing phase.  The 
current distribution is changed by modifying the 
gap between the monopole and sleeve.  After 
characteristic parameters such as input 
impedance and CP axial ratio (AR) are 
investigated versus varied quasi-loop dimensions, 
the proposed antenna is optimally designed and 
fabricated to exhibit its attractive CP radiation 
performances.  
3.  RESULTS 
 Fig. 7 shows that the measured and 
simulated reflection coefficients of the proposed 
GPS/DCS antenna for the case of t1 =1 mm, t2 = 
1mm, t3 = 2mm, and Wm = 3 mm.  The 
obtained impedance bandwidth (-10 dB 
reflection coefficient) reaches 720MHz 
(1.24-1.96 GHz) or about 45 % referenced to 1.6 
GHz, which covers the bandwidths of the GPS 
and DCS operations. The simulated and 
measured AR against frequency in the broadside 
direction is shown in Fig. 8. The measured CP 
bandwidth of 3 dB AR is about 80 MHz, which 
is much larger than the bandwidth specification 
(2 MHz bandwidth required) for GPS operation 
at 1.575 GHz.  The effects of varying the 
geometric dimensions of the gap between the 
monopole and sleeve on the impedance 
bandwidth are studied.  Fig. 9 presents the 
reflection coefficients against frequency for 
various spaces t1 = 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 mm, where t2 
= 1mm and t3 = 2 mm, are fixed.  Although the 
impedance matching condition for the case of t1 
= 2 mm is better, the case of t1 = 1 mm will be 
preferable in order to obtain the wide operated 
bandwidth.  Fig. 10 shows the comparison of 
the reflection coefficients in terms of the 
different monopole width Wm.  The current 
density on the monopole resonator is sensitively 
distributed when changing the width Wm.  In 
order to obtain the good AR bandwidth 
performance, the case of Wm = 3 mm is chosen.

Antenna Design 
In this paper, two types of the slot antenna were designed, fabricated and measured. These proposed 
antennas are fabricated on a 0.8-mm-thick FR-4 substrate with a dielectric constant of εr = 4.4 and tan δ = 
0.0245. The slot is etched on the ground plane of the substrate as a radiating element.  The area of the 
ground plane for the tested slot antennas is 100×100 mm2.  The length L of the slot is determined to be λg / 2 
(where λg is the guided wavelength at 2.4 GHz) in order to obtain a maximum power at the broadside 
direction.  A microstrip-fed line on the bottom plane of the substrate is as a probe excitation of the slot 
antenna to excite the slot mode. 
The Z-like slot antenna with four tuning stubs (Antenna A) presented in [5] is shown in Fig. 1(a).   
The conventional rectangular slot is replaced with the Z-like slot.  This antenna has two excitation modes 
due to the coupling effect between the microstrip-fed line and two slot edges.  The bandwidth at the lower 
resonant band can be enhanced double.  By adding symmetrical tuning stubs, the upper resonance excited 
by the first higher order mode is lowered from 6.22 GHz to 5.124 GHz.  Two neighboring stubs can be 
treated as a capacitor and the loading effect due to the capacitive coupling structure enhances the matching 
condition.  The results of the above antenna are reported for reference. 
The proposed slot antenna (Antenna B) is illustrated in Fig. 1(b).  Each slot is split into two fingers at 
each wing without enlarging the slot dimension.  By employing the method, the capacitive coupling 
between the microstrip feed line and four slot edges results in the double excited modes.  Moreover, a 
couple of the tuning stubs are added at the slot edge.  Matching is achieved by tuning the widths of the slots 
W1 and W2.  Due to the higher impedance resulted from the stronger coupling between two neighboring 
edges, the width of the open circuited microstrip line inside the front slot (W2) should be narrowed. The 
geometrical parameters of the two slot antennas are described in Table I.  In our experiment, the 
dimensional parameters of the feed line are changed and compared in order to obverse the variation of the 
impedance bandwidth and the initial resonant frequency of the proposed slot antennas. 
 
Results 
Figure 2 and 3 show the simulated and measured comparisons of the reflection coefficient of the two 
proposed slot antennas without the tuning stubs.  According to the results, we observe that the bandwidth at 
the lower resonant band of the proposed slot antenna is broadened by increasing the finger-slot number and 
can meet the specification of the WLAN system whose resonant bandwidth is within the range of 2.400 to 
2.483 GHz (for S11 < -10 dB).  It is also found that the resonance number of the slot antenna and the initial 
resonant frequency increase as the finger-slot number increases as well.  When appropriately designed, 
these resonances can merge and result in an antenna with a much larger bandwidth.  By empirically tuning 
the position and dimensional parameters of the feed line, the matching condition at the lower resonant band 
can be effectively improved.  Figure 4 plots the measured impedance locus of two slot antennas on the 
Smith chart at 2.4-GHz band.  More excitation modes of the proposed slot antennas come from the coupling 
effect between the microstrip-fed line and slot edges.  The capacitive coupling between the microstrip-fed 
line and slot edges leads to change the impedance trace and improve the impedance characteristics at the 
lower resonant band. 
Figure 5 shows the measured reflection coefficient of the three proposed slot antennas (Antenna A and 
B). Two neighboring stubs treated as the capacitors due to the capacitive coupling structure enhance the
