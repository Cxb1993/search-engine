Abstract 
 
We present a novel approach to decant supernatant on a microfluidic disc.  By manipulating 
the centrifugally induced pressure and the elastic deformation of the chamber’s plastic lid, fixed 
amounts of supernatant can be decanted into the detection chamber at very low rotational speeds.  
This approach has the advantages of simple design and low manufacturing cost.  It has been 
applied to on-disc separation of plasma from whole blood.  The results showed good stability 
and repeatability on the decanted volume.  The decanted plasma is high purity and the decanted 
volume is independent of hematocrit.

實驗結果與討論 
本實驗中利用光碟產生形變來定量並傾注液體的原理如圖 1 所示：在一矩形的儲存槽
裡注入液體，在高速旋轉時，因爲轉速增加產生液體壓力沿著半徑方向的增加 (圖 1a)。此
壓力造成光碟變形，使液體液面高度下降 (圖 1b)，在降低轉速後，又會因為液體壓力的減

本研究利用此機制發展出血液分離及定量血漿傾注的技術。實驗設計如圖 2a 所示，首
先將血液注入至樣品收集槽(sample reservoir)，以 5000 RPM 的旋轉速度將樣品傳送至傾注
槽(decanting chamber) 如圖 2b.II.，由於光碟在高轉速下會因為液體壓力產生變形，使傾注
槽容納更多的血液，因此，所有的血液將儲存於傾注槽內而不溢流入檢測槽(detection 
chamber)。同時，在離心力場的作用下，密度差使血液分離成下層的血球以及上層的血漿
如圖 2b.III.。當光碟停止旋轉時，光碟會因液體壓力的減少恢復成原來的形狀。此時，上

在此機構下，液體傾注的體積取決於光碟形變的形變量。此形變量可經由電腦模擬計

Abstract. This work presents a novel approach to decant and meter supernatant on a centrifugal 
platform.  Supernatant decanting, such as decanting plasma from the centrifuged whole blood, is an 
important sample preparation procedure for the whole blood bioassays.  By manipulating the 
centrifugally induced pressure and the elastic deformation of the chamber’s plastic lid, fixed amounts 
of the supernatant can be decanted into the detection chamber. This approach has the advantages of 
low manufacturing cost and ease of operation. 
Introduction 
“Lab-on-a-chip” or “micro total analysis systems” (TAS) have been intensely studied in recent 
years.  Many applications such as DNA analysis, glucose monitoring, and immunoassays have been 
developed.  Advantages for lab-on-a chip devices include the reduction in reagent/sample 
consumption, parallel processing and short turnaround time.  One of the most important aspects of 
lab-on-a-chip technology is its ability to integrate various sample preparation steps (such as 
separation, metering, and mixing) in one single device.  It is especially important for point-of-care 
devices, in which the complete assay protocol needs to be carried out from whole blood to analytical 
results.  It is also desired that the devices can be operated automatically to eliminate the need for 
skilled technicians and to reduce the number of human operating errors. The first sample preparation 
procedure is usually plasma extraction from whole blood.  A few approaches have been proposed to 
separate cells from whole blood in microfluidic devices using magnetic susceptibility[1, 2], acoustic 
force[3],  filtration[4], and plasma skimming techniques[5-7].  In addition, a few approaches have 
also been attempted to decant the separated plasma to the reaction chamber on a centrifugal platform 
with the assistance of wax valves[8, 9] ,capillary action and siphoning effects[10-12].  In this work, 
we present a novel approach to decant supernatant by manipulating the centrifugally induced pressure 
and the elastic behavior of the plastic lid of the chamber.  In addition, this approach is also capable of 
metering the volume of the decanted supernatant.  The experimental results showed that plasma with 
high purity can be gathered and metered through this decanting designs. 
Experiment 
The centrifugal platform used in this study is a sandwich-like structure with two polycarbonate discs 
on both sides and a double-sided pressure-sensitive adhesive layer in between.  The size of the 
polycarbonate disc is similar to a commercial digital video disc with diameter of 120 mm.  Discs with 
two different thickness, 0.56 mm and 0.52 mm respectively, were used in this study in order to 
observe the effect of deformation while maintaining the rigidity of the platform.  The thickness of the 
pressure-sensitive adhesive is 0.1 mm.  The fluidic structures were made by patterning the 
pressure-sensitive adhesive layer with a cutting plotter (CAMM-1 CX24, Roland).  The entry and 
venting holes were drilled on the discs with a CNC plotter (3D MDX-20, MODELA). 
To observe the flow characteristics under high rotational speeds, a flow visualization system similar 
to one mentioned in previous literature[13] was built.  The spinning control system consists a motor 
(HC-KFS053, Mitsubishi) and a motor controller (PCI-7332, National Instruments).  A computer 
program (LabVIEW, National Instruments) was used to manage the rotational speed of the motor.

 Conclusions 
We have successfully developed a novel approach for supernatant decanting and metering on a 
centrifugal platform. Precise amounts of plasma can be gathered by injecting a fixed amount of 
whole blood into a microfluidic disc.  The fluidic structure is very simple to fabricate and no 
surface modification is required.  Therefore, the device can easily be mass-produced.  Another 
advantage of this process is that it uses a relatively low rotational speed to move the plasma into an 
inner region of the disc.  Therefore, fluidic functions such as mixing for biochemical reactions can 
be carried out afterwards on the sample disc.  We believe that this approach can be easily 
integrated with clinical assays for point-of-care applications.

Abstract.  This work reports a novel mixing design that can do fast, batch-typed liquid mixing on a 
centrifugal platform.  Mixing is an important procedure for many applications related to chemical 
reactors and biological assays, especially in the field of microfluidics.  The extremely small sizes of 
microchannels make it difficult to achieve turbulence to assist mixing.  To overcome this problem, a 
meandering fluidic design on the centrifugal platform is proposed.  Centrifual force promotes mixing 
by inducing lateral flow movement in the circular section and flow focusing effect in the bending 
section.  The degree of mixing was studied for solutions with various viscosities under different 
rotational speeds.  The experimental results showed that this mixer can mix microliter or nanoliter 
volumes of aqueous solutions within one second. 
Introduction 
In recent years, microfluidics has become a mainstream technology.  It has been demonstrated that 
large-scale laboratory instruments can be replaced with miniaturized systems, which offer a variety of 
advantages, such as reduced reagent/sample consumption, parallel processing, and short turn-around 
times.  Many basic analytical steps can be integrated so that complex diagnostic tasks can be 
performed on a microfluidic substrate no larger than a credit card.  This kind of system is sometimes 
called a “lab-on-a-chip”[1].  A few applications, such as HIV detection, immunoassays, DNA 
analysis
 
and glucose monitoring have been developed.  One special type of „„lab-on-a-chip‟‟ is the 
“lab-on–a-disc” technology, which exploits centrifugal forces on the platform to transport liquids, 
performing processes such as blood sedimentation[2, 3], metering[4, 5], mixing[6-13]
 
and detection. 
Rapid mixing is essential to chemical reactions and biomedical analysis in microfluidic systems.  
However, since typical hydrodynamic conditions encountered in microchannels are strictly laminar, 
mixing remains a major challenge in microfluidic systems.  Effective mixing has been approached by 
several methods, including diffusion-limited speed of mixing[14], generation of secondary flow with 
three-dimensional structures[15], and utilization of Dean‟s vortex.[16]  On the centrifugal platform, 
proposed mixing methods include the Coriolis force [17], magnetic beads[9], and frequent reversal of 
the direction of spinning[9, 18, 19].  One of the advantages for the centrifugal platform is that it is 
capable of handling low volumes of liquid since the liquid driving force is based on the body force.  In 
this work, we present a design for mixing solutions with low volumes on a centrifugal platform in 
which the effect of mixing is based mainly on centrifugal force.  The research covered mixing 
mechanisms in the circular and bending sections of the flow channels, and mixing efficiency for 
solutions with various viscosities and operating conditions. 
Experimental Setup and Flow Scheme 
Glycerol/water mixtures with various viscosities (1 ~ 70 cp) were used as the model fluids in this 
study.  To observe the effect of mixing, food coloring and fluorescent dye (Fluorescein, Aldrich) were 
added to the mixture.  In addition, ultraviolet-curable glue was used to capture the flow pattern under 
high rotational speed.  The microfluidic mixing channel was made by bonding two flat discs together 
with a pressure-sensitive adhesive (100 m).  The size of the disc was similar to a commercial digital 
versatile disc (DVD), 120 mm in diameter and 0.6 mm in thickness.  The microfluidic structure was

 Conclusions 
We have successfully developed a novel mixing approach that uses a centrifugal platform for liquids 
with volumes measured in microliters or nanoliters.  In addition, the fluidic structure is very simple 
and can be manufactured at low cost.  We believe that this approach can be easily integrated with 
clinical assays for point-of-care applications.
