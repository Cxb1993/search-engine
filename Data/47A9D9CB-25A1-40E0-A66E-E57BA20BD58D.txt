I. Introduction（前言）
The problem of selecting a given number of nodes in an all-optical WDM network for placement of wavelength
converters in order to minimize the connection blocking probability is known as the wavelength converter placement
problem. The wavelength converter placement problem has been studied in [1]–[5] for all-optical WDM networks with
ﬁxed routing algorithms and in [6] for all-optical WDM networks with alternate routing algorithms. Placement of
wavelength converters in an all-optical WDM network with an alternate routing algorithm is more complicated than
in a network with a ﬁxed routing algorithm due to the increased complexity and diﬃculty in estimating the traﬃc
pattern according to the alternate routing algorithm.
In [6], the minimum blocking probability ﬁrst (MBPF) method was proposed based on the estimated traﬃc pattern
produced by the hop-count based ﬁxed-alternate routing algorithm, and the weighted maximum segment length (WMSL)
method was proposed according to the estimated traﬃc pattern produced by a dynamic-alternate routing algorithm
called least-loaded routing algorithm. That is, a speciﬁc wavelength converter placement method was designed according
to the traﬃc pattern produced by a given alternate routing algorithm. The drawback of the approach is that the
performance of the network may be degraded when the alternate routing algorithm is replaced by an algorithm that
is diﬀerent from that the converter placement method is designed for.
The objective of this project is to devise a method for placement of wavelength converters in all-optical WDM
networks such that the selected locations will yield low connection blocking probability even when the network changes
its routing algorithm from one alternate routing algorithm to another. It is expected that a good alternate routing
algorithm would try to route the traﬃc such that the resulting traﬃc pattern is close to the optimal traﬃc pattern
that minimizes the connection blocking probability. Therefore, a converter placement method that selects the nodes
based on the optimal traﬃc pattern is proposed.
The optimal traﬃc pattern is used to estimate the amount of traﬃc intensity that needs to be converted from one
wavelength to another at each of the nodes. Based on the optimal traﬃc pattern, a method to approximate the amount
of traﬃc intensity which needs to be converted from one wavelength to another is proposed. The wavelength converters
are placed at the nodes where they are needed most. Simulations are performed to study the performance of the
proposed converter placement method. The simulation results show that the proposed method yields lower connection
blocking probabilities than the methods proposed in [6] regardless whether the hop-count based ﬁxed alternate routing
algorithm or the least-loaded routing algorithm is used in the network.
The rest of this project is organized as follows. The problem of ﬁnding the optimal traﬃc pattern that minimizes
the approximate blocked traﬃc intensity is formulated as a nonlinear multicommodity ﬂow optimization problem and
solved in the next section. A method to calculate the amount of traﬃc intensity which needs to be converted is proposed
in Section III. Performance comparisons are carried out via simulations in Section IV. Finally, some concluding remarks
are given in Section V.
II. Finding the Optimal Traffic Pattern（尋找最佳流量分配）
Since the optimal traﬃc pattern is utilized as a part of the proposed method to ﬁnd the locations of converters, the
optimal traﬃc pattern needs to be obtained ﬁrst. In this section, the notations used in formulating the optimization
problem are ﬁrst introduced. Then, the objective function which is the approximate amount of blocked traﬃc intensity
is derived. Finally, the problem is formulated as a nonlinear multicommodity ﬂow optimization problem and solved by
a standard optimization technique.
Let the total amount of blocked traﬃc intensity be denoted by ρb. To calculate the total amount of blocked traﬃc
intensity, the amount of blocked traﬃc intensity on each routing path needs to be calculated ﬁrst. Let the blocking
probability of a connection request on routing path p(s, d, k) be denoted by b(s, d, k) which is calculated as follows:
b(s, d, k) = 1−
∏
lij∈Sksd
(1−Bij) (5)
Since the product of two or more blocking probabilities of diﬀerent links is expected to be much smaller than the blocking
probability of a single link, these terms are ignored as an approximation. Let b¯(s, d, k) denote the approximate value
of b(s, d, k) which is derived from equation (5) as follows:
b¯(s, d, k) =
∑
lij∈Sksd
Bij =
∑
lij∈E
BijIij(s, d, k) (6)
Due to the diﬃculty in calculating the overall connection blocking probability in the entire network, another metric
which represents the approximate blocked traﬃc intensity ρ¯b in the entire network is used as the objective function in
the optimization problem. The approximate total amount of blocked traﬃc intensity is obtained by summing over all
routing paths; i.e.,
ρ¯b =
∑
s∈V
∑
d∈V−{s}
nsd∑
k=1
λ(s,d,k)
µ b¯(s, d, k)

nsd∑
k=1
λ(s,d,k)
µ BijIij(s, d, k)
=
∑
lij∈E
γij
µ Bij .
(7)
The last equality is due to equation (2). The approximate total amount of blocked traﬃc intensity, ρ¯b, is used as the
objective function.
C. The Optimization Problem（最佳化問題）
The problem of minimizing the approximate total amount of blocked traﬃc intensity, ρ¯b, is formulated as the following
nonlinear multicommodity ﬂow optimization problem:
Minimize ρ¯b =
∑
lij∈E
γij
µ
Bij (8)
With respect to γij , ∀ lij ∈ E (9)
Subject to constraints
n(s,d)∑
k=1
λ(s, d, k) = λ(s, d) , ∀s, d ∈ V, s ̸= d (10)
λ(s, d, k) ≥ 0, k = 1, · · · , n(s, d), ∀s, d ∈ V, s ̸= d (11)
The convexity of the objective function has been proved in [9]. Since the feasible region is a convex set, a local
optimum is also a global optimum. The nonlinear multicommodity ﬂow optimization problem can be solved by the
standard optimization techniques [10], [11].
III. Finding The Amount of Traffic Intensity Which Needs to Be Converted in Each Node
（尋找需被光波轉換之流量）
In the proposed method, the amount of traﬃc intensity which needs to be converted in each node is used to indicate
the need of the node to be the converter. The traﬃc intensity which needs to be converted between an input-output
link pair is deﬁned as the portion of traﬃc intensity passing through the node by the link pair and cannot ﬁnd the
common available wavelength on the link pair while there are available wavelengths on both of the links. The amount
of traﬃc intensity which needs to be converted in a node is obtained by summing over those between all link pairs
passing through the node.
To calculate the amount of traﬃc intensity which requires wavelength conversion between a link pair, a two-link path
model as shown in Fig. 1 is employed. The connections passing through a node can be classiﬁed into three categories,
namely, ﬁrst-link-only connections, second-link-only connections, and both-links connections. First, an exact markov
chain to describe the same two-link path system is proposed and an approximation method to obtained the product
form solution of each of the states is provieded then. Finally, the product form solution is used to obtained the amount
the traﬃc intensity which needs to be converted of each link pair.

The main idea is that the transition rate of between the all valid states (nij , njk, nik) and (nij , njk, nik+1) is adjusted
such that the new markov chain is time reversible and the steady state probabilities in the two markov chains is as
close as possible. In the exact markov chain, the transition rate from state (nij , njk, nik) to state (nij , njk, nik + 1)
depends on the state (nij , njk, nik) which makes the markov chain is not time reversible. In order to let the modiﬁed
markov chain be time reversible, let the transition rates from state (nij , njk, c) to state (nij , njk, c + 1) be the same
for all nij , njk where c is an integer constant between 0 and W . The transition rate from state (nij , njk, c) to state
(nij , njk, c+ 1) for all nij , njk pair is denoted as γ′ik(c).
Note that the steady state probability of state (nij , njk, nik) in the exact markov chain is denoted as pi(nij , njk, nik)
Let pi′(nij , njk, nik) denote the steady state probability of state (nij , njk, nik) in the approximate markov chain. The
main idea of the approximation method is that sum of the transition rates between two diﬀerent number of both-links
connections, nik, does not change. In the exact markov chain, the equation can be written down as follows.
W−c−1∑

i=0

In the approximate markov chain, the equation is as follows.

=
W−c−1∑
i=0
W−c−1∑
j=0
pi′(i, j, c)γ′ik(c)
(17)
In order to ﬁnd γ′ik(c) such that the steady state probabilities pi(i, j, c) and pi′(i, j, c) for all i, j can be as close as
possible, let pi′(i, j, c) = pi(i, j, c) for all i, j. That is,
W−c−1∑
i=0
W−c−1∑
j=0
pi′(i, j, c)γ′ik(c)
=
W−c−1∑
i=0
W−c−1∑
j=0
P (i, j, c)pi′(i, j, c)γik
(18)
Then, consider the markov chain when the number of both-links connections is ﬁxed, c. Since the ﬁrst-link-only
connections and second-link-only connections are independent, the steady state probability can be write as follows.
pi′(i, j, c) =
γiij
i!µi
γjjk
j!µj
pi′(0, 0, c) ∀ 0 ≤ i, j ≤ W − c (19)
Substitute equation (19) into equation (18), the equation is as follows.

Thus, the transition rate γ′ik(c) can be calculated as follows.

V. Conclusions（結論）
In this project, a converter placement method for all-optical WDM networks with alternate routing algorithm has
been proposed. The proposed converter placement method has been shown to be able to produce low connection blocking
probability even when the routing algorithm is changed from one alternate routing algorithm to a diﬀerent alternate
routing algorithm. The simulation results have shown that the proposed method yields lower connection blocking
probabilities than both the minimum blocking probability ﬁrst (MBPF) and weighted maximum segment length (WMSL)
methods proposed in [6] regardless whether the hop-count based ﬁxed-alternate routing or the least-loaded routing
is used as the routing algorithm. In other words, the proposed converter placement method is able to produce low
connection blocking probability when the routing algorithm is changed from the hop-count based ﬁxed-alternate routing
to the least-loaded routing and vise versa. The performance of the proposed method will be evaluated in networks with
other alternate routing algorithms in the future works.
VI. Self Evaluation（成果自評）
Two international conference papers [15], [16] have been published or accepted for publication. In [15], the allocation
algorithm of wavelength converters is proposed. In [16], the probability based dynamic-alternate routing algorithm
is devised to reduce the connection blocking probability. The journal versions of the two papers are prepared for
submission. In summary, we have achieved the objective of the project in this year.
