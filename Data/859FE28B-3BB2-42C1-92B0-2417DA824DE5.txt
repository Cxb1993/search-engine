construction have explored the importance of 
project requirements from the perspectives of 
major stakeholders. Empirical evidence that 
supports the importance of building project 
requirements is lacking. Thus, developing such 
support will illustrate the benefits of preproject 
planning. This study attempts to fill the gap in 
the literature by identifying the importance of 
building project requirements. This research 
employed survey methodology for data 
collection. In order to measure the importance 
of building project requirements, the data 
collection tool was used on projects in the 
Taiwanese building industry. A total of 135 
responses were collected via mail and online 
survey. 
 
2. Literature Review 
A review of the literature suggests that the 
use of project planning as a means to enhance 
project performance has been widely supported. 
Generally, many researchers have suggested 
that preproject planning provides significant 
benefits to capital facility projects. Prior 
research have suggested that increased levels of 
scope definition during the preproject planning 
phase may improve the accuracy of cost and 
schedule estimates as well as the probability of 
meeting or exceeding project objectives 
(Griffith and Gibson 1995; Hackney 1992; 
Hamilton and Gibson 1996; Merrow 1988; 
Dumont et al. 1997). While the diverse benefits 
of preproject planning have received substantial 
attention, the number of studies dealing with 
the importance of project requirements is rather 
scarce. This research adds to the literature in 
two valuable ways. First, it develops 
quantitative measures of relative importance of 
project requirements in the building sector. 
Second, it offers important results on the 
identification of key project requirement factors 
from the perspectives of major stakeholders 
involved in projects. 
 
3. Research Methodology 
3.1 Survey Process and Structure 
This research was divided into two phases. 
Phase 1 included determining the applicability 
of the proposed project requirements. A data 
collection tool was developed to determine the 
degree, if any, to which the proposed 
requirements apply to building projects. The 
data collection tool was designed to include 
requirements that were thought to have 
substantial impact on building projects. The 
original listing of project requirements, which 
resulted from both brainstorming and a 
literature search (Dumont et al. 1997; Cho and 
Gibson 2001), contained over 100 items. This 
list was too long to allow respondents to 
complete the survey in a reasonable amount of 
time. Therefore, a systematic method for 
eliminating some of the less important 
requirements was developed. Each requirement 
was then tested to ensure it applies to building 
projects. As such, the requirements were based 
on previous studies and interviews with 
construction practitioners. The industry 
interviews encompassed 11 executives from the 
Owner, Architect/Engineering (A/E) and 
General Contractor (GC) groups. For each 
proposed project requirements, the survey asks 
the participants to assess the extent to which 
individual requirements apply to projects in the 
building sector. This data collection tool offers 
respondents three optional responses: 
applicable, not applicable, or need to be revised. 
The data collection tool also allowed the 
participants to offer additional comments on a 
potential revision. The refined assessment items 
were included in the Phase 2 survey 
questionnaire. Finally, the Phase 2 survey 
makes use of 81 project requirements in 
assessing their relative importance.  
Phase 2 of the research entailed exploring 
the importance of building project requirements. 
A questionnaire was developed based on the 
results of the work done in Phase 1. The 
content validity of the questionnaire used in this 
research was tested through a literature review 
and interviews with construction executives. 
From a thorough literature review and 
4. Results of Empirical Analysis 
The survey sought to identify the most 
important project requirements in the building 
sector. The ranking of the most important 
project requirements for Owner, A/E, and GC is 
presented in Table 4. Eight building project 
requirements (mean scores were over 6) stood 
out as being very important from the 
perspectives of Owner, A/E, and GC groups: 
project schedule control, structural 
requirements, project cost control, governing 
regulatory requirements, project cost estimate, 
quality assurance and control, overview of 
work scope, and project control requirements. 
For the Owner group, the five most important 
building project requirements were structural 
requirements, quality assurance and control, 
building space, project schedule control, and 
project cost estimate. For the A/E group, the 
five most important building project 
requirements were project cost control, project 
schedule control, governing regulatory 
requirements, structural requirements, and 
project control requirements. For the GC group, 
the five most important building project 
requirements were structural requirements, 
structural design, project schedule control, 
project cost control, and quality assurance and 
control. Furthermore, Owner and A/E rated 
governing regulatory requirements as the sixth 
and third most important requirement, 
respectively, but as indicated in Table 4 GC 
rated it as the twenty-fifth. On the other hand, 
GC had high ranking for structural design 
(second) and electrical and mechanical design 
(ninth), but Owner and A/E had low ranking for 
the two requirements. In addition, the A/E 
group rated project schedule estimate as the 
ninth most important requirement, whereas 
Owner and GC rated it as the thirty-second and 
thirtieth, respectively. Finally, Owner had high 
ranking for building space (third), but as 
indicated in Table 4 A/E and GC had low 
ranking for this requirement (thirty-third and 
twenty-third, respectively).  
In contrast, Table 5 presents the ranking of 
the least important project requirements for the 
three groups. From the perspectives of Owner, 
A/E, and GC groups, the least important 
building project requirements (mean scores 
were below 5) is storage space. Additionally, 
the five least important building project 
requirements for the Owner group were 
loading/unloading facilities requirements, 
storage space, painting requirements, 
transportation requirements, and project 
strategy. For the A/E group, the five least 
important building project requirements were 
painting requirements, marketing strategy, 
storage space, loading/unloading facilities 
requirements, and windows and doors. For the 
GC group, the five least important building 
project requirements were storage space, future 
expansion considerations, value-analysis 
process, project objective statement, and 
marketing strategy. Finally, Owner and A/E 
had low ranking for plot plan and windows and 
doors, but as indicated in Table 5 GC had 
relatively higher ranking for the two 
requirements (they rank number 40 and 29, 
respectively). On the other hand, GC had low 
ranking for waste treatment requirements (rank 
number 72), but as indicated in Table 5 Owner 
and A/E had relatively higher ranking for this 
requirement (fiftieth and fifty-third, 
respectively). 
 
5. Conclusions 
While the diverse benefits of preproject 
planning have received substantial attention, 
the number of studies dealing with the 
importance of project requirements is rather 
scarce. The purpose of this study was to 
examine the importance of project requirements 
and to identify key requirement factors in the 
building sector. The eight building project 
requirements respondents considered most 
important were project schedule control, 
structural requirements, project cost control, 
governing regulatory requirements, project cost 
estimate, quality assurance and control, 
overview of work scope, and project control
