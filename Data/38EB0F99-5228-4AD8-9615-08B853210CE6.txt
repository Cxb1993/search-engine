4Abstract
Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), structurally similar to polychlorinated
dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),
are used as flame retardants in furniture, electronic goods and other consumer items.
Many studies have reported that environmentally ubiquitous PBDEs are mainly the result
of using PBDE-containing products indoors. Here we show that combustion sources
including waste incinerators, metallurgical processes, power-heating systems and so on
are more significant emitters of PBDEs to the atmosphere. Mean PBDE concentrations in
the stack flue gases of combustion sources range from 8.07 to 469 ng/Nm3, and their
global PBDE contributions are 6.28 tonnes/yr with predominant BDE-209, comparable to
the global fugitive PBDE emission (5.73 tonnes/yr) with abundant BDE-47 and BDE-99.
To substantially reduce human PBDE exposure, control of PBDE emissions from
combustion sources is more important than banning commercial PBDE mixtures.
Keywords: PBDEs, PCDD/Fs, stationary sources, stack flue gases
6[13]. However, the authors believed that they underestimated PBDE emissions, because
their model’s predicted concentrations in ambient air and environmental media were at
least one order of magnitude lower than field data from environmental measurements
[15].
In the present study, a total of 110 stack flue gas samples from stationary sources,
were examined in this study for both PBDE and PCDD/F concentrations, emission rates
and emission factors to clarify the relationship between these two structurally similar
compounds. By applying the ratios of PBDEs to PCDD/Fs I-TEQ concentration, the
global PBDE emissions from stationary sources were estimated from the global
established PCDD/F emission inventories.
Materials and Methods
Basic information concerning the stationary sources. The basic and operational
information of these stationary sources is described in Table 1. These combustion sources
included waste incinerators, metallurgical processes, power-heating systems.
Sampling Procedures.  Stack samples were collected isokinetically following U.S.
EPA modified Method 23 using a U.S. EPA Modified Method 5 sampling train. Sampled
8extraction and cleanup procedures. The concentrated extract was divided into two equal
aliquots for the separate analyses of PBDEs and PCDD/Fs. PCDD/F analyses are given in
detail in our previous work [16, 17].
For PBDE analyses, the concentrated extract was treated with 4 mL of sulfuric acid
(reagent grade) for the first procedure. For the cleanup procedure, a multi-layered silica
column was used, which was packed sequentially with a plug of glass wool, 0.3 mL
activated silica gel, 0.5 mL silver nitrate (AgNO3) silica gel (10%, w/w), 0.3 mL
activated silica gel, 0.5 mL basic silica gel, 0.3 mL activated silica gel, 6.2 mL acid silica
gel, and 2.0 mL of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The sample extract, dissolved in 5 mL of
hexane, was added to the multi-layered silica column with two additional 5-mL rinses.
The column was eluted with 30 ml dichloromethane/hexane (10/90, v/v) and the entire
amount eluted was retained. This solution was concentrated to a volume of about 1 mL
using a rotary evaporator.
The concentrated extract was added to an acid alumina column, which was packed
sequentially with a plug of glass wool and 10 mL acid alumina, followed by a sequential
elution using 15 mL of hexane followed by 20 mL dichloromethane/hexane (4/96, v/v).
The eluate was discarded. The column was eluted again with 30 mL
10
according to the following parameters: initial oven temperature began at 100 °C (held for
4 min), then increased at 40 °C/min to 200 °C (held for 3.5 min), and finally increased at
10 °C/min to 325 °C (held for 2.5 min). Helium at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min was the
carrier gas. For PCDD/Fs, the HRGC was equipped with a DB-5MS fused silica capillary
column (L = 60 m, i.d. = 0.25 mm, film thickness = 0.25 ?m) (J&W Scientific, CA). The
oven temperature was programmed with an initial temperature of 150 °C (held for 1 min),
followed by 30 ?C/min ramping to 220 ?C (held for 12 min), followed by a 1.5 ?C/min
ramping to 240 ?C (held for 5 min), then to 310 ?C (held for 20 min).
The HRMS (Micromass Autospec Ultima, Manchester, UK) was equipped with a
positive electron impact (EI+) source. The analyzer mode of the selected ion monitoring
(SIM) was used with a resolving power of 10000. The electron energy and source
temperature were specified at 35 eV and 250 ?C, respectively.
Quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) Limits of detection (LOD) were
defined as a signal-to-noise (S/N) greater than three for each chromatographic peak,
while the limit of quantification (LOQ) was defined as an S/N greater than ten. To
evaluate contamination during sampling, one field blank was taken during the individual

13C12-1,2,3,4,7,8-HxCDD, 13C12-2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF, 13C12-1,2,3,4,7,8-HxCDF and
13C12-1,2,3,4,7,8,9-HpCDF. The mean recoveries of PCDD/F surrogate standards for
stack samples were 97.3%-106%, within the Methods 23 recovery criteria (70%-130%).
This recovery demonstrates that negligible PCDD/F breakthrough occurred.  Surrogate
standard recoveries of PBDE samples could not be evaluated owing to the lack of
isotopic standards, but they are probably similar to those of the PCDD/Fs. Consequently,
the reported PBDE concentrations in this study were not corrected for the sampler
collection efficiencies.
Mean recoveries of PBDE internal standards were 56.2%-89.2% for stack flue gas
samplings, which all met the criteria of being within 25%-150% for the di- through
nona-brominated homologues, and 20%-200% for deca-BDE. Mean recoveries of
PCDD/F internal standards added to the samples before extraction for the tetra- through
hexa-chlorinated homologues were 69.0%-81.8% for stack flue gas samples.  Mean
recoveries of the hepta- and octa-chlorinated homologues were 70.0%-76.7% for stack
flue gas samples, which met the criteria of being within 25%-130%.

ng/Nm3 for electric arc furnaces (EAFs) (m=6, n=18), 45.0 ng/Nm3 for secondary
aluminum smelters (secondary ALSs) (m=4, n=9), 33.5 ng/Nm3 for power plants (m=3,
n=7), and 16.8 ng/Nm3 for boiler (m=1, n=1). The m and n in the above brackets
represent the number of sampled facilities and the number of successfully analyzed
samples, respectively.
Similar to the results for PCDD/Fs, the GM of the PBDE emission rates for sinter
plants (24.7 mg/hr), EAFs (11.3 mg/hr) and power plants (50.8 mg/hr) were the largest,
which is attributed to their huge flow rates of stack flue gases.  It is interesting that
while no commercial PBDE mixtures are added to the feeding materials or fuels of sinter
plants,  power  plants,  industrial  boilers  and  motor  vehicles,  PBDEs  were  still  found  in
their flue gases and exhausts. Therefore, PBDEs are formed by the brominated
compounds during the combustion processes or survive from the PBDE-contaminated
feeding materials or fuels.
PBDE concentrations in indoor and workplace air are listed in Table 11, and are one
to three orders lower than those in the stack and exhaust emissions.  An exception was
the dismantling area (650 ng/Nm3) of an electronics recycling facility that lacked air
filtration systems. Consequently, although commercial products used indoors can be in

Global PBDE fugitive emissions Fugitive emissions of PBDE homologues from the
production, use and landfill of the commercial PBDE mixtures are estimated following
the study of Schenker et al. [15], and are based on year 2005 by assuming 10 years of
product service life. The data and related factors are consistent with Schenker et al. [15],
except for the emission factors for the use phase of PBDE-contained products. Schenker
et al. [15] considered the different emission characteristics between polymer and textiles,
and estimated these separately. Their emission factors [15] (adopted from other
references) for penta-BDE in polymer and textiles were close, and were 2.7×10-4 and
3.3×10-4, respectively, while those of deca-BDE in polymer [15] and textiles [24] had
more than three orders discrepancy and were 3.9×10-8 and 9.5×10-5, respectively. The
deca-BDE emission factors (9.5×10-5) adopted for textiles seemed too large.
Consequently, the approach we use involves KOA, which was also employed by
Prevedouros et al. [13] and Breivik et al. [25], to evaluate the evaporative loss during the
use of products containing PBDEs. The KOA data used were from Wang et al. [26], and
the calculated deca-BDE emission factor was 1.06×10-8. The estimated global fugitive
discharges from all PBDE production processes, indoor use of PBDE-containing products,
18
ambient air samples in the east-central United States [2], Japan [29], China [30] and the
Arctic[31]. Furthermore, BDE-209 is also the major BDE congener in reference soil
samples from a Swedish study [32] and in terrestrial wildlife [9]. However, few studies
consider combustion emissions as potential PBDE sources to the environment, because of
poor understanding of their PBDE emission characteristics.
Commercial deca-BDE mixtures are slated for elimination, but this study indicates
that controlling PBDE mixtures in commercial products and other discharge pathways
(e.g., waste water) [33, 34] may not reduce human exposure. Instead, mitigation of PBDE
emissions from combustion sources is required to reduce environmental PBDE levels,
and thus the related global control strategies for PBDEs require significant changes to be
effective.
