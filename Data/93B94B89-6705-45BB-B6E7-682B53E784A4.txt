The main shortcoming of most multivariate control chart procedures is that they can detect an unusual 
event but do not directly provide the information required by a practitioner to determine which one of the 
p variables or which subset of them causes the out-of-control signal. This raises the issue of identification 
in relation to multivariate control procedures. 
 
Recently, intensive research has been conducted into the use of artificial neural networks (NNs) as an 
effective tool for detecting the deviation in mean and/or variance for univariate processes (Zorriassatine & 
Tannock, 1998). NN applications in this field have been reported to outperform traditional approaches. 
This project applies NNs to the on-line identification and quantification of mean shifts in MSPC 
procedures. The bivariate SPC, which is a limited case of MSPC (where p, the number of variables, equals 
two), is investigated as first step toward achieving the goal of MSPC. This project applies NNs to the on-
line identification and quantification of mean shifts in MSPC procedures. The bivariate SPC, which is a 
limited case of MSPC (where p, the number of variables, equals two), is investigated as first step toward 
achieving the goal of MSPC. Extensive simulation is carried out in this research to systematically 
investigate the effects of correlation on the performance of the proposed model. 
 
2  A Neural network-based model 
 
This section presents an automatic NN-based MSPC model that is designed to be applied to an automated 
manufacturing process; process data are collected automatically and monitored by a computer-based 
system, without the need for human intervention. This project addresses the individual data. Tracy, Young 
& Mason (1992) also reported that individual observations are often used in the situation of monitoring 
simultaneously several correlated quality variables. 
 
2.1 Model architecture 
 
This model consists of two sequential modules – Module I and Module II (Figure 1). Module I consists of 
an NN (Network A) that was designed and trained to on-line detect mean shifts in bivariate processes. 
Module II consists of four specialist NNs (Network B – Network E) that were designed and trained to 
quantify the magnitudes of the detected shifts. Two assumptions should be noted here. (1) The mean 
vector ?  and covariance matrix ?  of the in-control process are known exactly. In practice, the 
parameters will have been estimated from a sample of measurements of the process. (2) The covariance 
matrix (?) is held constant. 
 
2.2 Network design 
 
The back propagation network (BPN), which has been used in most applications in the field of NNs for 
SPC (Zorriassatine & Tannock, 1998), was applied herein to develop the model. Module I utilized a 4-
layer BPN (Network A), in which the input layer contained 36 neurons used to input data from 12 
consecutive sample data sets. Each data set comprised three data values (xi,1, xi,2, ?i) - the two quality 
variables and a corresponding statistical distance (calculated from Equation (1)). The output layer 
contained nine neurons, each one used for one of the nine shift categories that were determined by the 
positive or negative deviations of the two quality variables (Table 1). The outputs of Network A were 
scaled within [0, 1], where 1 indicates that the data are totally fitted to a particular shift category. There 
were two hidden layers, both of which contain 24 neurons. An important issue here is the number of input 
layer neurons, referred to as the identification (recognition) window size in the field of real-time NN 
applications in SPC, because the input data from the process are applied to these input layer neurons in a 
parallel manner. A threshold or cut-off value (θ) was applied to the outputs of neurons 2 to 9 in the output 
layer. Any value above θ was considered to signal the presence of a mean shift situation (i.e. the bivariate 
mean is no longer at µ0). With actually no shift present, a Type I error occurred when any of the output 
2 
that directly outputs the shift magnitude of the corresponding quality variable. The ? of each sample was 
not included in the input data set here. Networks B and C were designed to quantify the upward and 
downward shifts, respectively, of the first quality variable. Networks D and E were designed to quantify 
the upward and downward shifts, respectively, of the second quality variable (see Table 2).

2.3 Network training 
 
2.3.1 Generation of random bivariate process 
 
In this project, the Monte-Carlo simulation was used to generate the required sets of example shifts for 
training and testing the NN. Mean shifts are defined as sudden shifts in mean vector that show an abrupt 
change in levels within a series of observations (Western Electric, 1958). The process simulator used to 
generate shift data sets is described below. Each of the simulated data series is independent of all the other 
random data series. 
 
Random bivariate process simulator: 
 Xt = µ + nt + dt                                                                       (2) 
where 
 t : time of sampling. 
Xt : random bivariate vector that represents the two quality variables measured at time t. 
Xt will follow N(µ,?) when the process is in control. µ is the process mean vector when the process 
is in-control. ? =  .  σ

 2212
12
2
1
σσ
σσ 1 and σ2 are the standard deviations of the first and second quality 
variables, respectively. 
nt : common cause variation at time t, following N(0,?). For generating nt, random bivariate vectors, 
such as [x1, x2] representing a pair of observations from two independent normal distributions at 
time t, are first generated using Polar Method (Law & Kelton, 1982). Both x1 and x2 follow N(0,1). 
Then the independent normal values are scaled by a function of the lower triangular matrix of the 
covariance matrix (Lehman, 1977) to generate bivariate vectors for N(0,?) distribution. 
dt : special disturbance at time t. 
dt = u∗s 
u : parameter to determine the position of shifting (u = 0 before shifting; u = 1 after shifting). 
s : shift magnitude, such as (k1σ1, k2σ2), where k1 and k2 are the magnitudes of the process shift 
in  terms of σ1 and σ2 for the first and second quality variables, respectively. 
 
Before the process data were presented to Module I (Network A), two steps of data pre-processing - 
standardization and coding - were implemented to transform the original process data into a form suitable 
for NN training and recalling. In standardization, the data were standardized (scaled) using the Equation 
below. This standardization results in each quality variable having a mean of zero and a variance of unity. 
Standardization is a linear transformation procedure for transforming process data into a constant range of 
approximately [-3, +3], regardless of the data before standardization. This transformation is required 
because a trained NN can accept only a certain range of input data.

In training the NNs in Module II, the shift magnitudes of both quality variables (k1 and k2) were set to the 
values of (-3.25, -3.00, -2.75, …, -1.00, -0.75, 0.00, 0.75, 1.00, …, 2.75, 3.00, 3.25). Accordingly, each 
NN herein was trained by 253 shift combinations. For example, Network B was trained using shift 
categories C1, C2, and C3 that have 121 (112), 11, and 121 (112) shift combinations, respectively. Thirty-
five shift examples were generated for each combination setting. Additionally, the training example shifts 
were located at points 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 of the identification window, to enable the trained NN to analyze 
the shifts that could commence at various positions in the identification window. A total of 44275 
(253*35*5) shift examples were generated using Equation (2) as training examples for each of the NNs in 
Module II. 
 
The activation function, the initial network connection weight, the learning rate, and the momentum factor 
were set as in Module I. In the training process, the connection weights were also updated by applying the 
generalized delta rule (Rumelhart et al., 1986) and the convergence condition was achieved within 3 
training epochs with a confusion matrix coefficient > 0.95. Each trained NN was then tested using 44275 
testing examples that were also generated using Equation (2) but with different random seeds. The test 
results showed that, with all the correlation values studied herein, the overall errors of the shift magnitude 
quantification obtained by Networks B, C, D, and E were 0.091, 0.071, 0.088, and 0.085, respectively. 
The overall average error was 0.084, which was about 4.2% of the average target value (= 2.00 or -2.00). 
This result indicated that Module II can effectively quantify the magnitudes of the shifted variables. 
 
After the training was completed, the performance of the model was evaluated in terms of the CR 
(identification accuracy) and the ARL (identification speed) of Module I, and the quantification error of 
the shift magnitude of Module II. Here, ARL (out-of-control ARL) is the average number of observations 
taken before an out-of-control alarm (detected shift) is generated by the proposed model. This project took 
a moving window analysis approach (Guh & Tannock, 1999) to evaluate the performance of the proposed 
model. A sequence of simulated process data sets Xi = (xi,1, xi,2, ?i) was presented to the model in the 
moving window, which was incremented forward by one process observation, representing a single 
sampling interval. The process began under an in-control condition. The initial identification window 
contained no shift points. Shifts commenced as the identification window moves along the time series (at 
the 13th point in the time series). This approach is considered to be practical because, with on-line process 
monitoring applications, an out-of-control condition often occurs after a period in which the process is in-
control, and the actual starting point of the out-of-control condition is generally unknown. 
 
3 Evaluation results 
 
The magnitudes of the shifts of both quality variables (k1 and k2) were set to the values of (-3.25, -3.00, -
2.75, …, -1.00, -0.75, 0.00, 0.75, 1.00, …, 2.75, 3.00, 3.25) to evaluate the performance of the proposed 
NN-based model. Hence, the evaluation example set comprised 529 (232) shift combination settings. 
Simulation was also used to generate example shifts for evaluating performance. Ten thousand simulation 
runs were performed for each shift combination setting. All the shifts began at point 13 in the simulated 
process data stream. The first 12 data points were generated from a bivariate normal distribution (i.e. N(0, 
R)). The first 12 data were checked for any shifts before the identification process. If the first 
identification window was not free of mean shifts, the simulated process data stream was discarded and 
the next process data stream generated. 
 
Table 3 lists the CR and ARL results for Module I, according to the shift magnitudes - small, moderate, 
and large with various values of correlation (?). It should be noted that the ARL herein was calculated 
only for the correct identification of the actual shift. In Table 3, the overall CR and ARL are 97.9% and 
2.51, respectively, indicating that Module I exhibits a strong ability to on-line identify bivariate mean 
shifts. The standard errors of the results of the ARLs are under 3% of the calculated ARL. The shift

The overall average error of Module II was 0.102, which was about 5.1% of the average target value (= 
2.00 or –2.00). It should be noted that the results herein were calculated only for the shifts that were 
categorized correctly in Module I. These results also demonstrate that correlation value does not 
significantly affect the quantification accuracy for shift magnitudes in Module II.

Module II can quantify the shift magnitudes of each of the shifted quality variables. The overall CR and 
ARL of Module I are 97.9% and 2.51, respectively, while the overall error of shift magnitude 
quantification of Module II is 5.1% of the average target value. Therefore, with a specific correlation 
coefficient that can be estimated from an initial large number of samples beforehand, the proposed NN-
based model can be trained to not only efficiently detect and analyze the mean shifts, but also accurately 
describes the shift quantity of each of the shifted quality variables. The precise quantitative description of 
the mean shifts can greatly help quality practitioners to identify and rectify causes of an out-of-control 
situation. The mean shift addressed in this project is just one kind of typical control chart pattern (Western 
Electric, 1958). The proposed model could be expanded to recognize other control chart patterns (e.g. 
trend and cycle) to acquire more information when a multivariate process is out-of-control.
