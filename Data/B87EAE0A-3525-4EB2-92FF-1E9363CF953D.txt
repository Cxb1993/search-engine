measurement, is near 1060 nm at room 
temperature.  
First, we deposit a thin SiO2 layer by 
PECVD on the sample surface. The circular 
microdisk patterns are defined by electron-beam 
lithography on the SiO2 layer. The diameters of 
the defined pattern are 10 and 12 μm. Next, the 
circular patterns are transferred to the SiO2 layer 
by reactive ion etching (RIE). After removal of 
electron-beam resist, the circular SiO2 patterns 
are used as the etching mask for the two-step wet 
etching processes[11]. The cavity sidewall 
prepared by wet etching is smoother than the dry 
etched sample, and the cavity quality can be 
improved by reducing the surface scattering. 
During the first wet etching step which etches 
both cavity and cladding layers, the diameters of 
the remaining microdisks are smaller than the 
sizes of SiO2 mask defined by electron-beam 
lithography. The AlGaAs cladding layers near the 
perimeter are removed by selective wet etching 
step with dilute HF solution. The SEM image of 
the fabricated microdisk cavity is shown in Fig. 1. 
The upper larger disk of the double-disk 
structure is the contact layer.

microdisk after two-step wet etching. 
 
We use BCB.-based polymer[10] for device 
planarization. The refractive index of BCB after 
curing is 1.54. We expect that the WGMs can 
confine well in this slab waveguide structure. 
First, we spin BCB polymer and then cured at 
250 C. Next, we etch the BCB film by RIE 
down to the upper disk surface to form a planar 
structure. After the planarization step, the top 
contact layer surface is exposed. The patterns of 
p-side metal are defined by photolithography. 
The standard metallization process on both p- 
and n- sides, sample grinding, and rapid thermal 
annealing are then carried out to form good 
ohmic contact and hence to lower the series 
resistance. The cross-sectional SEM image of the 
current- injection microdisk laser is shown in Fig. 
2.

3. Measurement results and discussions 
 
In order to characterize the current-injection 
QD microdisk lasers, our samples are placed in a 
cryostat for temperature control. For room 
temperature measurements, the temperature is 
kept at 300 K. The microdisk lasers are injected 
by pulsed current to avoid the device heating. We 
collect the scattering light from the side of the 
microdisk. The spectra are recorded by a 
monochromator equipped with an InGaAs 
photodetector. 
The mode spectra of an 8.5-μm-diameter 
microdisk with different injection current are 
shown in Fig. 3. From the wide range spectra 
(Fig. 3(a)), only one lasing WGM is observed. 
The WGM wavelength centered at 1071 nm, 
which correspond to the TE(1,69) mode in a 
cylindrical resonator, where the m and n in 
TE(m,n) represent the radial and azimuthal 
numbers, respectively. There is no significant 
redshift observed with increasing current 
injection when operating at pulse injection 
condition, therefore, we conclude that the device 
 4 
laser. The observed threshold current is lower for 
the larger microdisk device. The lowest threshold 
current is measured in a 10.5-μm-diameter 
sample, with a threshold current of 0.62 mA.
