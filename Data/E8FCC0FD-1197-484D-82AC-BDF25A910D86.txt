processing, adding glass flux, and smaller particle sizes of the starting materials. Of 
the above methods, lowering the sintering temperature through glass addition is the 
most effective and least expensive technique. However, glass addition often results in 
the dielectric properties degradation due to the low-dielectric-constant additive 
dilution effect or the chemical reaction between glasses and BNBT ceramics to form a 
low-dielectric-constant phase [7-9]. Therefore, choosing a suitable glass flux that can 
reduce the sintering temperature below 900℃ and improve dielectric properties of 
BNBT-based ceramics simultaneously is important for the fabrication of LTCC 
modules. 
The main objective of this study was to develop a BNBT-based ceramics 
sinterable at temperatures below 900℃ and thus compatible with high-conductivity 
silver. The sintering behavior and dielectric properties of BNBT with the addition of 
various glasses were investigated. The relationships between the sintering temperature, 
microstructure evolution and dielectric properties of BNBT with various amounts of 
glasses are presented. 
2. Experimental procedure 
 The BaO．(Nd0.8Bi0.2) 2O3．4TiO2 ceramic (BNBT) was prepared from 
reagent-grade BaCO3, Nd2O3, Bi2O3, and TiO2, which were mixed and then calcined 
at 1200oC for 2 h. For the glasses, high purity powders of Bi2O3, ZnO, B2O3, and SiO2

 Wetting behaviors between BNBT and glasses were studied by placing a piece of 
a glass compact on top of a dense BNBT substrate and firing at 900℃ with a heating 
rate of 10℃/min. Contact angle was measured using a digital camera. The interfacial 
reaction between BNBT and glass was then investigated using SEM and EDX.  
3. Results and discussion 
 Figure 1 shows the effects of glasses on the wetting behavior between BNBT and 
glass sintered at 900℃. As the temperature becomes higher than the glass melting 
point, the glass starts to melt and spread over the BNBT substrate. For BB35SZ and 
BB45SZ glasses, the glasses completely wet the BNBT substrate. For BB25SZ glass, 
a small contact angle of less than 10° and an intimate contact between BB25SZ and 
BNBT substrate are obtained at 900℃. However, BB0SZ glass dewets the BNBT 
substrate. The results indicate that the addition of Bi in the glass can effectively 
decrease the contact angle between the glass and BNBT substrate. 
Figure 2 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the as-calcined BNBT powder 
and the sintered samples with 25wt% BB0SZ as a function of sintering temperatures. 
No second phase was detected for the sample sintered at 700℃. When the sintering 
temperature was elevated to 850℃ or above, the second phase, Ba2Ti9O20, was 
observed. This is in good agreement with the finding observed by Lu et al. [10], who 
reported that BaO．Nd2O3．5TiO2 ceramics was partially decomposed to form

lower temperature and larger shrinkages were observed for the samples containing 
BB25SZ and BB35SZ glasses in comparison to the sample with BB45SZ glass. The 
relative densities of the samples sintered at 900℃ as a function of the amount of 
various glasses added are shown in Fig.6. For the samples with BB25SZ and BB35SZ 
glasses, the maximum relative densities (91-92%) were obtained as the addition of 
glasses content were 20% while the relative densities decreased slightly with addition 
of higher glass content. However, all the samples with BB0SZ and BB45SZ glasses 
did not result in comparable densification. Figure 7 shows the microstructures of 
BNBT ceramics added with various glasses. In the case of the sample added with 
BB0SZ glass, a porous microstructure with little densification is observed (Fig.9), 
which may be resulted from the poor wetting between BB0SZ glass and BNBT 
ceramics. For the samples added with BB25SZ and BB35SZ, a more dense and 
uniform microstructure is observed. It is noted that with increasing the amounts of 
BB25SZ and BB35SZ, the amount of acicular grains increased, as reflected by strong 
(240) peaks in the XRD patterns. Figure 8 shows the TEM bright field image, 
HRTEM image and selected area diffraction patterns (SADP) of the sample added 
with 20wt% BB25SZ. The microstructure is found to comprise two types of grains (C: 
acicular grain and S: sub-rounded grain). The crystal structures of the grains S and C 
are both identified to be BNBT phase based on the SADP (Fig.8(c) and (d)). The

with BB35SZ and BB25SZ, respectively, which is as a result of the increase in the 
sintering density. On the other hand, as the addition of glasses was as large as 25 wt%, 
the dielectric constants were markedly declined. This could be attributed to the 
reduction in sintering density. The maximum dielectric constant of 84 was obtained 
from the sample added with 20 wt% BB25SZ glass sintered at 900℃, which might be 
the result of the absence of secondary phase and pores. The Qxf value has a similar 
trend with that of the dielectric constant. For the samples added with BB25SZ, the 
Qxf value increased from 2600 to 2999 as the content increased from 15 to 20 wt%. 
Further addition of BB25SZ over 25 wt% resulted in a great decrease in Qxf. In the 
case of the samples added with BB35SZ, the Qxf value revealed almost constant 
value around 1500 as the content of glass was increased from 15 to 20 wt% and then 
decreased to 950 as the glass content increased from 15 to 20 wt%. The measured 
values of the temperature coefficient of resonant frequency (τf) were in the range of 
15-25 ppm/℃ for the samples added with BB25SZ. However, in the case of the 
samples added with BB35SZ, the value of τf decreased from 28 to 23 ppm/℃ as the 
glass content of glass was increased from 15 to 20 wt% and then increased markedly 
to 58 ppm/℃ as the content increased from 15 to 20 wt%. A summary of the previous 
studies about BNBT ceramics added with various glasses and relevant dielectric 
properties are shown in Table 2 [7-9, 13]. These results indicates that the glass
