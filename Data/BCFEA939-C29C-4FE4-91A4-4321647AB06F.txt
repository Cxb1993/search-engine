ABSTRACT 
In this study, we examined the hypothesis that different inorganic carbon (IC) concentrations would 
enrich different ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) 
populations by operating two chemostat bioreactors fed with different influent carbonate 
concentrations at 15 and 100 mg-IC/L, respectively.  During the operation period, both bioreactors 
were able to maintain satisfactory nitrification efficiency higher than 95% at an influent ammonium 
concentration of 250 mg-N/L, and nitrate was the major end product without nitrite accumulation.  
Based on cloning/sequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) 
results targeting on ammonia monooxygenase gene subunit A (amoA) gene, Nitrosomonas nitrosa 
lineage was the dominant AOB population in the high-IC bioreactor, while Nitrosomonas europaea 
lineage was dominant in the low-IC bioreactor. The results of real-time polymerase chain reaction 
for Nitrobacter and Nitrospira 16S rRNA genes indicated Nitrospira was the dominant NOB 
population in high-IC bioreactor, while Nitrobacter was dominant NOB in low-IC bioreactor. 
Furthermore, results of batch experiments implied that Nitrifying community in high-IC sludge, 
namely Nitrosomonas nitrosa and Nitrospira, is able to proliferate only under higher IC with lower 
ammonia or nitrite condition. Our results clearly indicated that IC concentration is important factor 
to shape nitrifying community structure. 
 
fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis (Whang et al. 2009).  It is easily assumed that 
the response to IC concentration is different among AOB species.   
 
Tokutomi et al (2010) reported that the qualitative and quantitative shifts of Nitrosomonas sp. (as 
AOB) and Nitrospira sp. (as NOB) in an airlift-fluidized bed reactor by real-time polymerase chain 
reaction (real-time PCR) and T-RFLP analysis.  Several studies have indicated that Nitrobacter and 
Nitrospira were the prevailing NOB in the wastewater treatment process (Coskuner and Curtis 2002, 
Daims et al. 2001, Siripong and Rittmann 2007).  Models of r- and K-selection in microbial 
ecology revealed that Nitrospira is a K-strategist adapted to low nitrite and oxygen concentrations, 
while Nitrobacter is an r-strategist that thrives if nitrite and oxygen are present in higher 
concentrations (Schramm et al. 1999).  Some studies discussed effect of environmental or 
operational conditions on those two NOBs (Blackburne et al. 2007, Huang et al. 2010).  However 
the effect of IC on NOB community has not been studied. 
 
The goal of this study is to evaluate effects of IC on AOB and NOB community structures.  We 
operated two laboratory scale bioreactors under IC sufficient (high-IC) and limited (low-IC) 
conditions.  In order to investigate AOB and NOB community structures, T-RFLP and real-time 
PCR were employed, respectively.  Batch experiment was also performed to evaluate the 
dependences of nitrification kinetics on ammonium, nitrite and IC concentrations.  
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Bioreactor operation 
Two 5L lab-scale continuous-flow bioreactors were operated to evaluate the nitrification 
performance and microbial communities of AOB and NOB acclimated under IC sufficient (high-IC) 
and limited (low-IC) conditions.  15 and 100 mg-IC/L of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) was applied 
to mimic low- and high-IC conditions, respectively.  Ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) was added to 
maintain an influent concentration of 250 mg-N/L for both bioreactors. The concentrations of other 
nutrients were the same as the ATCC 1573 medium (Park and Noguera 2004).  The influent flow 
rate for both bioreactors was set at 0.5 L/day to maintain a 10-day hydraulic retention time.  The 
pH was maintained around 7 by phosphate buffer in the media and DO concentration was 
maintained above 2 mg/L through aeration using diffusers.  In order to minimize introduction of IC 
in bioreactors through aeration, CO2 in the air was absorbed by 1M NaOH solution before aeration.  
The bioreactor was mixed using a magnetic stirrer to avoid settling.  Temperature was maintained 
at room temperature during first 190 days of operation, but later was maintained at 30 °C.  The 
seeding sludge was obtained from a wastewater treatment plant treating petrochemical wastewater. 
 
DNA extraction 
Mixed liquor samples for DNA extraction were taken from bioreactor and stored at -20°C until 
extract DNA.  DNA was extracted using UltraClean Soil DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, 
Japan), 0.2 (Nitrospira) or 0.1 (Nitrobacter) µM of the each primer, and template DNA in a final 
volume of 20 µl.  Cycling conditions for Nitrospira 16S rRNA gene were as follows: 95°C for 20 
s , 40 cycles consisting of 95°C for 10 s, 58°C for 20 s and 72°C for 20 s (detection), followed by 
melting curve analysis (65°C to 95 °C with a heating rate of 0.1 °C/s). Cycling conditions for 
Nitrobacter 16S rRNA gene were as follows: 95°C for 20 s , 40 cycles consisting of 95°C for 10 s, 
60°C for 20 s and 72°C for 40 s (detection), followed by melting curve analysis.  
 
Batch experiments  
In order to evaluate the dependences of nitrification kinetics on ammonium, nitrite and IC 
concentrations, a series of batch tests were performed using activated sludges taken from the two 
bioreactors.  For each batch experiment, 330 mL of biomass and 70 mL of medium were mixed in 
a 1 L serum bottle.  Initial concentrations of IC and nitrogen compound (ammonium or nitrite) for 
each batch experiments were shown in Table 1.  Other medium components were the same as 
those used for bioreactor operation.  After aerating with pure oxygen for 2 minutes, the bottles 
were sealed with caps immediately.  The batch tests were carried out in an incubator maintained at 
30°C and 125 rpm.  Samples were taken frequently for nitrogen compound and mixed liquor 
volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) measurements.  pH and DO were monitored frequently during 
experiments.  The specific rates of ammonium or nitrite oxidation for batch experiments were 
calculated and their dependences on the nitrogen compound or IC concentrations were evaluated 
using Monod-type kinetic expression.   
 
Chemical analyses  
Ammonium (NH4+-N), nitrite (NO2–-N) and nitrate (NO3–-N) were measured by ionic 
chromatography (DX-120, Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA).  MLVSS was measured according to standard 
procedures (APHA et al. 1995).  Total inorganic carbon (TIC) was determined by Model 1020A 
TOC Analyzer (OI Analytical, College Station, TX).  
 
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers 
The amoA gene sequences determined in this study were submitted to the EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ 
databases under accession numbers AB622973 to AB622983.

Microbial community structure of nitrifying bacteria  
AOB community structure 
Cloning and sequencing of amoA gene fragments were performed to investigate the AOB 
community structure in the two bioreactors and seeding sludge.  The results showed that all of the 
cloned amoA sequences obtained from this study were within the genus Nitrosomonas (Nm.).  A 
neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree, which graphically depicts the homologies of aligned sequences, 
is presented in Fig. 2.  The expected T-RFs signatures (forward/reverse) were shown in the tree.  
Twenty-nine clones were randomly selected from seeding sludge and classified into 2 OTUs based 
on RFLP pattern.  OTUs S-1 (55.2% of total clones) and S-2 (44.8%) were phylogenetically 
related to Nm. eutropha (T-RF 491/491) and Nm. nitrosa (48/135) lineages, respectively.  For AOB

Fig. 2 Neighbor-joining tree based on amoA gene sequences from genus Nitrosomonas. Unrooted 
phylogenetic tree was generated using the neighbor-joining method and bootstrap tests were 
performed with 1,000 replicates.  Boot-strap values (>60%) are indicated at the branch points.  
The scale bar represents 5% sequence divergence. Accession numbers are given in parentheses.  
DNA from seeding sludge (S), sludges from high- and low-IC bioreactors (H and L) were used for 
cloning.  OTU was decided based on restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. 
Other sequences were retrieved from GenBank.  The expected forward and reverse T-RF lengths 
after digestion with TaqI are indicated.  
T-RFLP analyses for amoA gene in high- and low-IC bioreactor sludges were carried out until day 
305.  Three T-RFs, 491/491, 48/135, 219/270, were observed.  Based on the cloning, those T-RFs 
were assumed as Nm. eutropha, Nm. nitrosa and Nm. europaea lineages, respectively.  Fig.3 shows 
relative abundance of major T-RFs determined by the corresponding peak height from TET labeled 
amoA-2R primer.  In day2, only Nm. eutropha was observed in both bioreactors.  Then AOB 
community sift was observed in both bioreactors. In high-IC bioreactor, Nm. nitrosa became 
dominant population after day 47.  The dominant AOB shifted from Nm. nitrosa to Nm. europaea 
at Day 196, when temperature was dropped. But it shifted back at Day 239.  On the other hand, 
Nm. europaea became dominant population in the low-IC bioreactor after day 47.  The AOB 
community in low-IC bioreactor did not change after day 47.

relative abundance of Nitrospira and Nitrobacter in high- and low-IC bioreactors are shown in 
panels A and B, respectively. 
batch experimental conditions of NOB-1 (see Table 1), specific nitrite oxidization rate for low-IC 
sludge was higher than that for high-IC sludge.  On the contrary, in all condition of NOB-2 (Table 
1), the rate for both sludges was similar.  In the NOB-3 batch experiment (Table 1), the rate on 
5mgN/L of nitrate for low-IC sludge was slightly lower than that for high-IC sludge, but the rates 
on higher nitrite concentrations for low-IC sludge were higher than that for high-IC sludge.  Thus, 
as summarized in Fig. 6, when nitrate concentration was higher than 5 mg N/L, the rate of low-IC 
sludge was higher than that of high-IC sludge even if IC concentration was 100 mg C/L.  Under 
the lower nitrite (5mg N/L) and IC (0-2mgC/L) conditions, the rates of low-IC sludge were similar 
with that of high-IC sludge.  Under the lower nitrite and sufficient IC (100mg C/L) condition, the 
rate of low-IC sludge was slightly lower than that of high-IC sludge.

Fig.5  Specific ammonia oxidation rates of activated sludges from high- and low-IC bioreactors at 
different ammonia (AOB-1) and inorganic carbon (AOB-2) concentrations. 
members of Nm. europaea lineage are relatively abundant among AOB in several systems (Gieseke 
et al. 2003, Schramm et al. 2000), presumably due to its relatively high maximum ammonium 
conversion rate compared to those of other AOB populations (Koops and Pommerening-Roser 2001, 
Prosser 1989).  Therefore, results of microbial community analysis were consistent with the results 
of kinetic analysis.  
 
Several studies reported that Nm. nitrosa was dominated in the activated sludge from industrial 
wastewater treatment plant (Cabezas et al. 2009, Dionisi et al. 2002, Kim et al. 2011, Kuo et al. 
2006, Layton et al. 2005).  In addition, Nm. nitrosa Nm90 was isolated from industrial sewage in 
Germany (Koops et al. 1991).  However, the factor which provided Nm. nitrosa an advantage over 
another AOB has not been studied.  On the other hand, previous study reported that Nm. europaea 
was also found to be dominant during the bioreactor operation buffered with NaOH, while 
Nitrosospira was responsible for an improved ammonia conversion during the operation buffered 
with Na2CO3 (Whang et al. 2009).  Thus, both of our and previous results showed Nm. europaea 
was dominated in low-IC condition.  However, the mechanism has not been clarified.  
   
The difference mechanism and characteristics of carbon fixation among AOB species may be one of 
the possible reasons.  AOB fix CO2 using the Calvin–Benson–Bassham (CBB) and its key enzyme, 
the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (RubisCO) (Schramm et al. 1998, Utaker et al. 2002).  It 
was reported that transcription of cbb genes, which encode carbon-fixing enzyme RubisCO, of Nm. 
europaea was upregulated when the carbon source was limited (Wei et al. 2004).  Namely, Nm. 
europaea responds to IC limitation by prioritizing resources towards key components for carbon 
assimilation.  However, the responses of Nm. nitrosa and Nitrosospira to IC limitation have not 
been discussed.  Other difference is that Nm. nitrosa has carboxysomes, while Nm. europaea does 
not have (Koops and Pommerening-Roser 2001).  Carboxysomes is a bacterial microcompartment 
that enhances CO2 fixation (Yeates et al. 2008).  It was suggested that carbonic anhydrase is 
sequestered with RubisCO inside the carboxysome.  The form of inorganic carbon used as a 
substrate by RubisCO is CO2, rather than bicarbonate (Tabita 1999).  That is, it was assumed that 
carboxysomes help to proliferation of Nm. nitrosa under IC rich condition.  In addition, Nm. 
europaea Nm50 had a "green-like” type I RubisCO (similar to RubisCO genes found in green 
algae), whereas Nitrosospira spp. generally have a “red-like” type I RubisCO (Utaker et al. 2002).  
The affinity of RubisCO enzyme for NaHCO3 is different among the species (Hatayama et al. 2000).  
Although the exact mechanisms are not clear at this time due to the lack of knowledge, it will be 
interesting to clarify whether those differences cause to the different response of IC concentration 
among AOB species or not. 
 
Dominant NOB populations in high- and low-IC bioreactors were Nitrospira and Nitrobacter, 
respectively.  Some studies reported that Nitrobacter is a superior competitor when nitrite is 
abundant, while Nitrospira thrive under conditions of nitrite scarcity (Blackburne et al. 2007, 
CONCLUSION 
This study evaluated the effects of inorganic carbon (IC) on nitrifying community structures and 
their nitrification performance in two bioreactors under IC sufficient (high-IC) or limited (low-IC) 
conditions. The conclusions of our study are as blow. 
 IC concentration affected AOB community structure.  Dominant AOB populations in high- 
and low-IC bioreactors were Nm. nitrosa lineage and Nm. europaea lineage, respectively.  
 Inorganic concentration also affected NOB community structure.  Dominant NOB populations 
in high- and low-IC bioreactors were Nitrospira and Nitrobacter, respectively.  Our results 
implied that limited IC condition inhibit the Nitrospira growth even if nitrate concentration is 
low.  On the other hand, IC concentration did not affect Nitrobacter growth. 
 Both bioreactors performed more than 95% of nitrification efficiency except for the high-IC 
bioreactor during the temperature drop period.  IC concentration did not affect on nitrification 
in both bioreactors.  
 Batch results demonstrated that effect of IC on nitrifying community under different ammonia 
or nitrite concentration.  Nitrifying community in high-IC sludge, namely Nm. nitrosa and 
Nitrospira, may be able to proliferate only under higher IC with lower ammonia or nitrite 
condition.

ABSTRACT   
The diversity and abundance of ammonia-oxidizing Betaproteobacteria (-AOB) and archaea 
(AOA) were investigated in a full-scale municipal wastewater treatment plant where the wastewater 
salinity level varied considerably in the study period.  Based on the quantitative PCR of amoA 
genes, an increase in the AOB amoA gene copies occurred with a decrease in the wastewater 
salinity level.  A corresponding decrease in the average AOA/AOB ratio, from 1.22 (the 1st and 2nd 
year), 0.17 (the 3rd year), and then to 0.07 (the 4th year), was observed.  Phylogenetic analyses on 
amoA gene sequences indicated that Nitrosomonas marina-like AOB and “water column/sediment” 
lineage AOA were dominant when the wastewater salinity level fluctuated at high values with an 
average of 4.83 practical salinity unit (psu), while Nitrosomonas urea-like AOB and “soil/sediment” 
lineage AOA became dominant when the wastewater salinity decreased to a more stable lower level 
with an average of 1.93 psu.  Based on the amoA-based terminal restriction fragment length 
polymorphism (T-RFLP) analyses, results from this study demonstrated that the observed shift in 
AOB and AOA populations is likely caused by a change of the wastewater salinity level. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Ammonia in natural waters can be toxic to the aquatic life at sufficiently high levels and consume a 
large amount of oxygen in receiving waters.  To safeguard our water resources, the removal of 
nitrogen from discharged wastewater is an essential step to prevent the eutrophication of receiving 
rivers or lakes.  Nitrification, the key and often rate-limiting step in nitrogen removal, is known to 
consist of a series of microbial oxidation processes regulated by two different groups of bacteria: 
the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) that oxidize ammonia to nitrite and the nitrite-oxidizing 
bacteria (NOB) that converts nitrite to nitrate.  The first step of the oxidation, i.e., the conversion 
 
The primary objectives of this work were to determine the relative abundance of AOB and AOA 
and to monitor their temporal community dynamics over time in a full-scale municipal WWTP 
bioreactor, where the wastewater salinity varied considerably over time.  Toward this end, monthly 
samples were collected over a 4-year period at a well-mixed activated sludge bioreactor in Tainan, 
Taiwan.  These samples were then analyzed using the quantitative PCR (qPCR) to measure the 
archaeal and bacterial amoA gene abundance, the cloning/sequencing of the amoA genes to 
elucidate the AOA and AOB community structures, and the amoA-based terminal restriction 
fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) to track the temporal dynamics of AOB and AOA 
lineages.  Finally, the variations of the AOA/AOB abundance and community structures with the 
wastewater salinity were also discussed.   
 
MATERIALA AND METHODS 
WWTP, operational conditions, and bioreactor performance.  
AP WWTP, the research site for this study, is a municipal WWTP located in Tainan, Taiwan that 
serves a population of 400,000 people; the plant discharges the treated wastewater into the Taiwan 
Strait.  With a design capacity of 132,000 m3 day-1, the plant employs a primary sedimentation 
followed by a conventional activated sludge process for removal of organic pollutants and oxidation 
of nitrogen compounds.  The HRT of the aerated activated sludge bioreactor varied between 6-12 
h with an average of 8 h, and the solids retention time for the activated sludge system was 
controlled at 10 days.   
 
During the study period, the monthly grab samples of influent and effluent of the AP bioreactor as 
well as activated sludge samples were collected for this study.  Samples were then stored in an icy 
cooler and immediately transported to the laboratory for analysis.  1-ml sludge samples were 
centrifuged for 3 min at 14000 g, the supernatant was decanted and the concentrated samples were 
stored frozen at -20°C until applied to DNA extraction.   
 
Concurrent to the grab sampling, the operational variables, e.g., the chemical oxygen demand 
(COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS), mixed liquor 
volatile suspended solids (MLVSS), pH, temperature, ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate, were regularly 
monitored by the AP WWTP staffs. Determination of COD, MLVSS, and nitrogen species were 
accomplished via standard procedures (1).   
 
The average influent COD and ammonium concentrations of the bioreactor were 100 mg/L and 18.3 
mg-N/L, respectively.  With an average biomass concentration of 1500 mgVSS/L, the fully aerated 
activated sludge bioreactor removed organic pollutants from water to give COD less than 20 mg/L 
and meanwhile oxidized ammonia to nitrate with efficiency more than 90%.  The wastewater 
influent conductivity with a corresponding mean salinity of 3.58 practical salinity unit (psu) varied 
method.  All sequences within an OTU, which defined in this study, are at most 3% distant from 
all the other sequences within the OTU (37). The sequences determined in this study have been 
deposited in the GenBank database under the accession numbers: HM589703-HM589711, 
HM589713, HM589715-HM589758, HM589760- HM589778, HM589780-HM589852.  
 
Real-time PCR of amoA genes.  
A lightCycler 2.0 (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) was used for all real-time quantitative 
PCR (qPCR) assays in this study. All assays were carried out in triplicate. The PCR mixture 
consisted of 10 μl of 2× SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Perfect Real Time; TaKaRa), 0.2 μM of the primer, 
and 20-80 ng of DNA template in a final volume of 20 μl.  The primer set and real-time qPCR 
condition for -AOB amoA gene was the same as described previously (44). The primer set, 
Arch-amoAF and Arch-amoAR, was used in the real-time q-PCR assays targeting on the archaeal 
amoA gene (14). The real-time qPCR for AOA amoA gene was performed with the following 
reaction step: an initial hotstart at 95.0°C for 20 s; 50 cycles of 95.0°C for 10 s, 53°C for 20 s, and 
72.0°C for 30 s, followed by a melting curve analysis (65°C to 95°C with a heating rate of 0.1°C/s). 
Data were analyzed using Light Cycler software (version 4; Roche Applied Science). The standard 
curves used for quantification were established with the plasmid prepared from clones containing 
partial archaeal and bacterial amoA DNA with accession numbers HM753263 and HM753264, 
respectively 
 
Statistical analysis.  
To analyze the effect of environmental factors on ammonia-oxidizing microorganism competition, 
the Person correlations were determined by use of STATISTICA 7 software (StatSoft, Tulsa, Okla.) 
with different time lags. Correlations with P value less than 0.05 was judged as statistically 
significant and a strong correlation was defined as one with P values less than 0.01.  
Activated sludge samples were taken from ten municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) 
with influent ammonia concentrations less than 50 mg-N/L located in different countries, including 
Anping (AP) WWTP in Taiwan, Pohang (PH) WWTP in Korea, Shatin (ST) and Stanley (SL) in 
Hong Kong, and Palo Alto (PA), Chambersburg (CB), Dane-Iowa (DI), McMinnville (MM), 
Hammonton (HM), and Chalfont (CF) WWTPs in USA. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of 
the ten WWTPs and their operational parameters, including flow rate, solids retention time, 
hydraulic retention time, influent organic compounds, ammonia-nitrogen in influent and effluent, 
DO, and the PCR amplification result of AOA and AOB amoA gene. Although the WWTPs 
investigated in this study were not all required and dedicated for nitrogen removal, nitrification was 
observed in these bioreactors.  Sludge sampling, DNA extraction, PCR, cloning and sequencing 
were conducted, targeting on amoA gene of AOA and AOB, as described in previous studies (Park 
et al. 2006; Park et al. 2009; Wells et al. 2009; Whang et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2009). Primer sets 
amoA-1F/amoA-2R and Arch-amoAF/Arch-amoAR were used in this study for amplifying amoA 
gen of AOB and AOA, respectively (Rotthauwe et al. 1997; Francis et al. 2005).

within bioreactors as well as in a variety of natural environments remain meager (12, 30, 46).   
 
Results from this study suggest that shifts in the relative abundance of AOB and AOA populations 
in the AP WWTP depend highly on the change of the wastewater salinity level.  The fluctuating 
but equally abundant amoA gene copy numbers of AOB and AOA populations observed from the 
AP WWTP samples taken in the 1st and the 2nd year can be attributed to a relatively high salinity 
level observed, with an average of 4.2 psu, caused by the uncontrolled sea-water intrusion.  In the 
3rd year, the level of AOB amoA genes gradually increased and stabilized at an average of 300 
copies/ng DNA, while the AOA amoA genes stayed at the level of 11 copies/ng DNA for the 
February to August samples but suddenly increased to an average of 116 copies/ng DNA for the 
October to December samples.  The slightly lower salinity level (3.16 psu) observed during 
February to July in the 3rd year could favor the AOB populations, while the sudden increase in 
salinity level (9.41 psu) observed during the typhoon season (August to November in the 3rd year) 
could favor the AOA populations.  After carefully controlling sea water intrusion issue in the AP 
WWTP since December of the 3rd year, the AOB populations have been relatively abundant due 
presumably to a relatively low salinity level at an average of 1.96 psu. 
 
In general (supplement table), the wastewater characteristics (COD, N) and operational parameters 
(DO, HRT, SRT) of the AP WWTP were comparable to those of the PARWQCP in Wells et al. (46), 
except for a higher salinity level in the current AP WWTP.  It is speculated that the high salinity 
levels (3-10 psu) facilitates the growth of AOA over AOB in the AP bioreactor, although conditions 
of high DO and low HRT within bioreactors that disfavors AOA communities have also been 
reported (30, 46).  On the other hand, whereas a decrease in COD loading seemed to promote the 
growth of AOA over AOB in the bioreactor reported in Jin et al. (17), AOB was however always 
more abundant even under a high salinity (10 psu) and a low DO (0.5 and 1 mg/L).  It is likely that 
a much higher influent ammonium (100 and 200 mg-N/L) applied in the study of Jin et al. (17) 
favors the growth of AOB over AOA in the bioreactor (12, 26, 39). Nevertheless, with currently 
available information, the question of what parameter is responsible for the dominance of AOA over 
AOB, or vice versa, in these highly complex and dynamic bioreactors remains unclear (12).  
Indeed, by linking the relative abundance of AOA and AOB populations with the wastewater 
salinity level (Table 1), we found that a time lag effect of the measured wastewater salinity level on 
the AOA/AOB ratio may present.  Considering the SRT around 10 days in the AP WWTP and the 
slow-growing nature of both AOA and AOB, it is speculated that the relatively high AOA/AOB 
ratio observed could be related to the high wastewater salinity level measured 16 days ago.  
Therefore, it is suggested that the time lag effect be taken into consideration when investigating the 
linkage between environmental parameters and the AOA and AOB populations in these highly 
complex and dynamic bioreactors.

column/sediment” and “soil/sediment” clusters was clearly detected, but the shift of dominant AOA 
OTUs in relation to the salinity change was less certain compared to that of AOB.  This is mainly 
because only one pure culture of AOA are currently available for detailed physiological analysis 
(40), namely Nitrosopumilus maritimus, an autotrophic ammonia-oxidizing marine archaeon (19), 
and a enrichment of Nitrososphaera gargensis, a moderately thermophilic ammonia oxidizer from a 
hot spring (15), that is closely related to the major group of AOA detected in soils (23).  Despite 
the fact that limited information is available for AOA communities in wastewater bioreactors, Park 
et al. (30) have found that AOA associated with the “soil/sediment” cluster accounted for more than 
75% of the 75 sequences retrieved from five full-scale wastewater bioreactors.  It is hypothesized 
that low DO levels and long retention times are important factors to facilitate the growth of AOA, 
but the relative abundance of AOA in these plants requires further investigations (30).  Similarly, 
Limpiyakorn et al. (25) found that most of the sequences retrieved from four municipal WWTPs fell 
into a soil lineage (81%) with few sequences found to belong to a marine lineage (19%).  In a 
recent study on laboratory enrichment of nitrifying sludges under various ammonium 
concentrations, Sonthiphand and Limpiyakorn (39) observed a significant drop in AOA amoA 
abundance and a population shift from the Nitrososphaera gargensis-like AOA to AOA populations 
related to the sequences retrieved from saline sediment environments, although the salinity level 
was constantly low during enrichment.  By investigating AOA communities in laboratory- and 
full-scale bioreactors, Zhang et al. (50) also found that AOA related to the “soil/sediment” cluster 
were dominant in two full-scale bioreactors treating fresh and saline wastewater respectively, but in 
the laboratory-scale bioreactor treating saline wastewater (10 psu) the Nitrosopumilus 
maritimus-like AOA was dominant (17).   
 
Although their detailed physiological properties with respect to the salinity requirement are not 
clear yet, it is reasonable to hypothesize that a high salinity condition may promote the growth of 
the marine group representative, Nitrosopumilus maritimus, while a low salinity condition may 
promote the growth of the soil group representative, Nitrososphaera gargensis.  Based on the 
retrieved AOA sequences from the AP bioreactor, the shift from the OTU 2 to the Nitrosopumilus 
maritimus-like AOA and then to the Nitrososphaera gargensis-like AOA is possibly attributed to 
the decreased wastewater salinity level.  Unlike the temporal dynamics of AOB populations that 
clearly matched the wastewater salinity change, the dependence of AOA temporal dynamics, as 
detected by the TRFLP patterns, on the salinity change was less assured.  According to the amoA 
TRFLP patterns for AOA, the shift from the “water column/sediment” OTUs 2, 3, and 4 to the 
“soil/sediment” OTUs 5 and 7 followed the general trend of the decreased wastewater salinity level, 
except that the sudden increase in salinity level during the typhoon season (August to November in 
the 3rd year) might promote the growth of the “water column/sediment” OTU 1 population.  
However, for the samples of January and December of the 4th year, the dominance of the OTUs 1 
and 3, which were closely related to the Nitrosopumilus maritimus-like AOA, did not reflect the fact 
of relative low salinity levels observed in those periods.  It is possible that some Nitrosopumilus

二、與會心得 
與 2008 年的 ISME12 相比，這次有非常多的論文針對氣候變遷等環境問題，
因此比上次來得有收穫。本人將無論聆聽口頭報告、參閱海報展覽、與參展廠商交
談等所得的收穫分別敘述如下: 
 
1. 口頭報告聆聽心得 
 
 IS25.001 RE-EVALUATING NITRIFICATION IN MARINE ECOSYSTEMS: 
ASSESSING THE RELATIVE DIVERSITY, ABUNDANCE, AND ACTIVITY OF 
AMMONIA-OXIDIZING ARCHAEA AND BACTERIA Francis, C* Environmental 
Earth System Science, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States  
 
本論文研究自然環境中如海洋、底泥等氨氧化微生物之生態與其對自然界中氮
循環之相關性。演講者對此課題曾發表過多篇文章，雖然與本人的研究課題「生物
廢水處理系統氨氧化微生物之生態」不盡相同，但其研究方法論與成果對本人的未
來研究有極大之幫助。

2. 參閱海報展覽心得 
本次研討會的最深印象為，使用 NMDS、主成分分析(principal component 
analysis, PCA)、甚至 corresponding analysis 等多變量分析法展現微生物生態，
似乎以成為一普遍的趨勢。2008 年 ISME12 會中發表者約 6 篇左右使用此技
術，但今年已無法數計! 取下列幾張將環境因子與細菌社群逐天變化共同展示
的 MDS-Biplot 為例說明之。在與該海報展出作者詢問之後，得知 Biplot 的作
法在於細菌 DNA 必須與環境因子的矩陣具同的一個軸。舉例而言，在我的研
究中，T-RFLP 片段長度與 TPH 的濃度可共享一的採樣日期以達到矩陣具同的
一個軸的效果，但實際使用尚未實驗成功。所普遍使用的統計軟體有免費下載
的 R Statistical Package (http://www.r-project.org)及需購買的 PC-ORD (已取得)。

3. 與參展廠商交談心得 
本次研討會的最大收穫為取得 MO BIO 生技公司出品的 PowerSoil DNA 
Isolation Kit，其針對含高腐植酸的環境樣本如堆肥(compost)、沉積物
(sediment)、糞便(manure)，並可偵測 G+、G-細菌(e.g. Bacillus subtilis、Bacillus 
anthracis)、真菌、藻類、放線菌(e.g. Streptomyces)等。也參觀了 MO BIO 發表
的關於萃取土壤中 DNA 的 2篇海報。
