III. GEOMETRIC KINEMATICS 
A. Direct Kinematics 
In order to control the position and orientation of the 
end-effector of manipulators, it is necessary to establish the 
kinematics model. Firstly, Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H)  
method was used to define the coordinate of each link as Fig.

After establishing link D-H parameters, direct kinematics 
of the left arm was developed by using the homogeneous 
transformation matrix. Direct kinematics was used to 
transform joint positions (joint space) into the position and 
orientation of end-effector (Cartesian space). The matrix Ti as 
(1) is a general type for transforming adjacent coordinate.

The dual-arm robot system was developed in this study. 
And the simulations show that the geometric kinematics 
derived in this paper is correct. It indicates that the dual-arm 
robot can be controlled in position control level. In the future, 
precision object operation control techniques will be 
developed. Combining with vision system and mobile 
platform, we hope that the dual-arm robot system can 
autonomously handle the assigned tasks.

ABSTRACT 
 
Photopolymer/carbon black nano composite has been successfully synthesized by novel method using 
visible-light. The composite that consist of TPA and HDDA photopolymers as matrix and nano carbon-
black as fillers were mixed together with appropriate dispersant to control distribution of filler into 
matrix. The compound then was cured layer by layer using masked-visible light to form a prototype. 
The curing time behavior, mechanical properties and thermal stabilities of the prototype have measured 
and analyzed by using Rigid body Pendulum Rheometer, Universal Tensile Machine, and Differential 
Thermal Analyzer respectively. The results show that the presence of carbon black decrease the curing 
time of the sample. In other hand, the presence of carbon black and dispersant into photopolymer 
matrix in appropriate composition will not only increase both of tensile strength and hardness but also 
increase the thermal stabilization due to increasing the pyrolysis temperature.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
The first techniques for rapid prototyping became available in the late 1980s and were used to produce 
models and prototype parts. Today, they are used for a much wider range of applications and are even 
used to manufacture production-quality parts in relatively small numbers, because of need very high 
accuracy and long processing time. General rapid prototyping systems, in accordance with processing 
materials can be divided into solid, powder, three kinds of liquid materials. First, Solid State Class: includes all

The effect of filler additon into matrix, principally reduce amount of bonding between polymers matrix. It will 
consequently increase the curing time of sample. 
 
3.2 Mechanical Properties 
  
Figure 2  (a) and (b) show that additional of 0.5 wt % of carbon black into photopolymer matrix with additional 
dispersant in appropriate composition could effectively increase both of its tensile strength and hardness. However, 
by further additional of carbon black and dispersant could decrease both of its tensile strength and hardness. 
Because of additional excess fillers could decrease of distribution of filler into matrix. Besides, the excess fillers 
into polymers matrix will reduce free radical formation in which stimulate bounding between polymers during 
exposured on light that finally reduce its tensile strenght. The same effect on hardness of sample that is the excess 
fillers could reduce hardness of sample.

3.3 Thermal Properties  
 
Figure 3 (a) shows that TPA / HDDA with the absence of any other filler, only added photo initiator, start to 
decompose at temperature about 268.12oC and complete to decompose at temperature about 489.27oC. Both of 
figures (b) and (c) show that with additional of 0.5phr and 1phr of carbon black start decomposition temperature
