The reason why the tangential field vector 
( )U ρ  is defined to be different from those 
defined in [2-4] is to acquire some flexibility 
in dealing with boundary conditions. In other 
words, various materials in region 1 (or even 
in region 4) can be tackled without too much 
change in formulation. 
In the finite-difference (FD) procedure, the 
tangential field components at aρ =  are 
related to those at bρ =  by a propagator 
matrix Φ  as

If region 1 is not a PEC or a PMC, the

dielectric layer ( b cρ≤ ≤ ) are considered. As 
shown in Fig. 6, our computed phase 
constants are in very good agreement with 
those computed by Lee and Hsu [6]. 
Shown in Figs 7 and 8 are the dispersion 
curves for the cases where the outer dielectric 
layer is replaced by a composite material. In 
Fig. 7, four different values of pσ  are 
considered for vσ  = 0 and 0θ  = 0, whereas 
in Fig. 8, three different combinations of pσ  
and 0θ  are considered for vσ  = 0. In these 
two figures, smaller values of pσ  result in 
smaller attenuation constants. In the lossy 
cases, attenuation constants increase with 
frequency, reach a peak, and then decrease 
with frequency. Why the attenuation-constant 
curves are not monotonically decreasing 
functions of frequency as in the first scenario 
is not known and remains to be sought. 
Interestingly, the case with pσ  = 0.0001 S/m 
and 0θ  = 90o has larger attenuation constants 
than does the case with pσ  = 0.0001 S/m 
and 0θ  = 0. This is because the electric field 
for the fundamental mode is oriented in the 
transverse direction. Hence, the fiber with 0θ  
= 90o will then attenuate the fields more than 
that with 0θ  = 0. 
For the third scenario, we first compute the 
phase constant curves for a circular dielectric 
cylinder, in order to validate the compute 
code. The cylinder has a radius of b = 1 m and 
a dielectric constant of 10. Presented in Fig. 9 
are the phase constant curves of the first four 
eigen modes, which agree very well with 
those in [7].   
Presented in Figs. 10 and 11, respectively, 
are the phase constants and attenuation 
constants of the HEM11 modes for a dielectric 
cylinder covered with a composite material 
for different values of pσ . In calculating 
these data, we faced with the same troubles as 
before. That is, the attenuation constants seem 
to increase without bound as the frequency 
decreases. The complex-root searching 
routine that we used could not converge. 
Hence, no results can be shown for the lower 
frequency region. However, if different values 
of vσ  are considered for pσ  = 0 and 0θ  = 
0, the attenuation constants are finite, as can 
be seen in Fig. 12. In fact, they increase with 
frequency first, reach their maxima, and then 
decrease with frequency. The same 
phenomena can be observed for the TM01-like 
modes as well, as shown in Figs. 13 and 14. 
 
IV CONCLUSIONS 
 
In this report, a state-space model has been 
developed for analyzing the guiding 
properties of a cylindrical shell consisting of 
both chiral and fiber-reinforced composite 
materials. Three kinds of structures have been 
investigated in this report. They are (1) a 
circular waveguide, (2) a circular surface 
waveguide, and (3) a circular dielectric 
waveguide. In the case that the structure has a 
nonzero conductivity along the axis of the 
cylinder, the root-finding routines may not 
converge in the lower frequency region. In 
other words, we may have failed to find 
solutions in the lower frequency region for 
some special cases. This trouble remains to be 
solved in the future.
