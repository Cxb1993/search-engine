acetone as a solvent and supercritical carbon dioxide 
as a spraying medium. The lower concentrations of 
polymer solution, optimized volume flow ratios, and 
higher temperatures in saturator can effectively 
reduce the mean particle size. At the optimized volume 
flow ratios, the composition of CO2 in the feed 
streams was near the bubble points of the saturator 
temperatures. The precipitation kinetic parameters 
were determined from the particle size distributions 
with the aid of the MSMPR population balance theory. 
This study found the primary nucleation to be dominant 
in precipitation and diffusion may govern particle 
growth. The results of PMMA have been published in the 
Journal of supercritical fluids. The results of PMMA-
co-BMA have been submitted for publication in the SCI 
journal. And the results of water-soluble chitosan are 
being prepared for publication in the SCI journal.

較高的溶質濃度亦增加微粒成長與聚集的現象
產生，導致微粒的粒徑增大且分布寬廣。 
3.2. 飽和槽溫度效應 
表 1 的 runs #2、#5~#7 為探討飽和槽溫度
(TS)之效應，結果顯示，在固定幾丁聚醣溶液濃

時，沉澱槽溫度從 368.2 K(run #2)升至 388.2 
K(run #9)，平均粒徑從 187 nm 減少到 153 nm。
幾丁聚醣溶液經飽和槽由噴嘴噴入沉澱槽內，
沉澱槽溫度愈高，溶劑蒸發效果愈好，有利於

實驗樣品，幾丁聚醣微粒粉末呈現變色現象(淡

佳之沉澱槽溫度為 368.2 K。 
3.4. 體積流率比效應 
Reverchon et al.[3]利用 1 wt.%乙酸水溶液
為溶劑，以 SAA 法製備幾丁聚醣微粒，三成分
(CO2-乙酸-水)高壓相平衡中，富水相之二氧化

1. Introduction 
Over the previous decades, several supercritical fluid-assisted methods have been developed to 
prepare fine particles with unique characteristics in numerous industrial fields. These particulate 
processing techniques can be roughly classified, based on the function of supercritical fluids as: (a) a 
solvent, e.g., the rapid expansion of supercritical solution, RESS; (b) a solute, e.g., the particle from 
gas saturated solution, PGSS; (c) an anti-solvent, e.g., supercritical anti-solvent, SAS; (d) a spraying 
medium, e.g., supercritical assisted-atomization, SAA, and carbon dioxide assisted nebulization with a 
bubble dryer, CAN-BD. Reverchon and Antonacci [1] successfully developed a SAA process to 
produce micro- and nano-meteric particles for pharmaceutical compounds, salts, dyes, catalyst, and 
superconductor precursors. The supercritical carbon dioxide was dissolved first in liquid solution 
containing water or organic solvents with solute. The mixed solution was then sprayed into a vessel via 
a nozzle at near atmospheric pressure under a flux of hot N2. This process involves two steps of 
atomization. First, the primary droplets are formed at the exit of the nozzle by pneumatic atomization. 
Second, the secondary droplets are subsequently generated by rapidly releasing CO2 inside of the 
primary droplets (decompressive atomization). Then, the ultra-fine particles obtained by the 
evaporation of solvent and supersaturation of the solute.  
Reverchon et al. [2] investigated micronization of Pigment Red 60 with both the SAS and SAA 
methods, and discovered that nano-metric particles could be formed using the SAS, with a low yield 
for SAS micronization. However, micro-metric particles were produced using SAA, thus, the yield of 
the SAA process was larger than 95 %. The morphology of the resulting products using the 
supercritical anti-solvent (SAS) process is closely dependent on the phase regions where the 
precipitations are implemented. Micro-meteric aggregated ball-like particles were produced as the SAS 
process passed by the vapor-liquid coexistence region, whereas nano-metric particles were obtained in 
the either supercritical or superheated vapor region [3,4]. Reverchon and Antonacci [1] micronized the 
PMMA particles using the SAA process. The experimental results indicated that the morphology, 
particle size and distribution of PMMA microparticles were dependent on the mass flow ratio of 
carbon dioxide to liquid solution. While increasing the mass flow ratio, the operating condition 
probably fell into the vapor-liquid coexistence region and resulted in the coalescence of particles 
collected in the precipitator. Wu et al. [5, 6] have investigated the dispersion of 1 wt % of Pigment Red 
177 and Violet 23 particles in propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PGMEA) using a 
supercritical fluid-assisted dispersion process (SFAD). The SFAD process maintained at the 
supercritical state is effective in improving particle dispersion. As shown from these results, the phase 
behavior of mixtures in the high-pressure chamber is one of the crucial factors of the supercritical 
 8
2.2 Apparatus and operation 
Fig. 1 is the schematic diagram of the SAA apparatus installed in the present study.  The 
apparatus consists of three main chambers and feeding lines. The three chambers are: saturator (8), 
precipitator (10), and separator (14). The saturator is a high-pressure vessel (10 cm3, Applied 
Separations, USA) loaded with protruded stainless steel packing (PRO-PAK○R  0.16 inch protruded 
packing, Scientific Development Co., USA), assuring a large contact surface between the liquid 
polymer solution and CO2. The solution obtained in the saturator was sprayed through a spray nozzle 
(9) (I.D. 130 μm, model: TP500004-TC, Spraying System Co., USA) into the precipitator. The 
saturator was circulated in a thermostatic water bath (5), which was regulated to within ±0.1 K. The 
water bath temperature was measured with a precision platinum RTD sensor (12) (model: 1560, Hart 
Scientific Co., USA) to an accuracy of ±0.02 K. A pressure transducer (13) (model: PDCR 4070, 
ranging 0-35 MPa, Druck, UK) with a digital display (model: DPI-280, Druck, UK) was used to 
measure the operating pressure in the saturator, accurate to ±0.1 %. The precipitator (10) (volume, 
3.14 dm3) was immersed in a thermostatic air bath, which was regulated to within ±0.5 K. A 0.5 μm 
metal frit (11) was mounted at the outlet (bottom) of the precipitator to retain the polymer particles. A 
separator (14) followed the precipitator to separate the solvent and gas mixture at near atmospheric 
pressure. The flow rate and total volume of carbon dioxide and nitrogen passing through the 
precipitator were monitored using a wet test meter (15) (model: TG20, Ritter, Germany) to an accuracy 
of ±0.25 %. Three feeding lines are a polymer solution (4), carbon dioxide and nitrogen. A HPLC 
pump (3) (model: PU-1580, JASCO, Japan) was used to deliver the polymer solution and another 
high-pressure liquid pump (2) (model: NPL-5000, Nihon Seimitsu Kagaku Co., Japan) for carbon 
dioxide. The N2 flow was controlled using a mass controller (6) (model: 251- FKASBYAA, Porter, 
USA) from a cylinder, heated in an electric heat exchanger (7) (series 93, Watlow, USA) and sent to 
the precipitator to assist the liquid droplets evaporation. 
The experimental procedure is described as follows. The saturator temperature (TS) and the 
volumetric flow rate of carbon dioxide were at pre-set values. The precipitator temperature and N2 
were specified to 333.2 K and 0.8 Nm3/hr. As a steady-state was achieved, the polymer solution was 
introduced into the saturator via the pre-heating water bath (5) at a specified flow rate (the majority of 
flow rate was 5 ml/min). The carbon dioxide mixture that was dissolved in the polymer solution and 
obtained in the saturator was sprayed through an injection nozzle to produce atomization of liquid 
droplets in the precipitator. Upon contact of the droplet solution with the heated N2 and the resulting 
evaporation of acetone from the droplets, the polymer particles formed due to the supersaturation of 
the solute. During the SAA process in this study, the pressure in the saturator was almost constant 
 10
2.3.1 Effect of spray angle of nozzle 
Two spray angles (5o, 50o) of nozzles were used in the SAA process, the operating condition of 
two runs (#1 and #4 in Table 3) was C = 10 kg/m3, R = 1.2, and TS = 353.2 K. Fig. 3 shows the particle 
size distributions of the samples produced with different nozzles. The sharp particle size distribution 
(PSD) was obtained as the larger spray angle nozzle (50o) was used, and the mean particle size 
increased accordingly while decreasing the spray angle of nozzle. In small spray angle nozzle, the 
atomized liquid stream in nozzle outlet approximated solid stream, the resulted PMMA therefore was 
not favor the smaller particles sizes. The spray angle nozzle of 50o was thus utilized throughout all the 
rest of the experiments.  
2.3.2 Effect of concentration of polymer solution 
 The effect of the solute concentration on particle size was obtained at different PMMA 
concentrations (C) in acetone between 1 and 50 kg/m3 (runs #2 to #6 in Table 3), at the condition of the 
saturator temperature (TS = 353.2 K) and R = 1.2. The FESEM images of sample particles shown in Fig. 
4 are always formed by discrete spherical sub-micrometric particles and are collected at different C. 
Fig. 5 shows that the lower concentration (C) of polymer solution can effectively reduce the particle 
size and sharply the size distribution. Fig. 6 shows the mean particle size ( nod ) varying with the 
concentration of polymer solution. These results explained the greater viscosity or surface tension of 
the higher concentration solution might cause the larger liquid droplets and increased the polymer 
particles size.   
2.3.3 Effect of saturator temperature 
The effect of the saturator temperature (TS) on the PMMA particles was also obtained at various 
temperatures from 313.2 to 363.2 K (runs #4, and #7 through #9 in Table 3), at the condition of the 
concentration of polymer solution (10 kg/m3), and the volumetric flow rate ratio (R) of 1.2. Fig. 7 
shows the mean particle size ( nod ) of the PMMA varying with the saturator temperature, indicating 
that the smaller PMMA particles were formed at higher temperatures. Assuming that the solution in the 
saturator can form a homogenous liquid phase, the composition of carbon dioxide in the solution 
depends on the volumetric flow rate ratio (R) and limits to the VLE phase envelopes. According the 
VLE diagram (Fig. 2), at a constant pressure (P = 6.5 MPa), the point B refers to R = 1.2 and is near 
the composition of carbon dioxide in saturated compressed-liquid (bubble point) at 353.2 K. And then, 
the composition of CO2 at the bubble point increases with decreasing temperatures, e.g., the bubble 
point at 333.2 K is approximately R = 1.6~2.0 (points C or D in Fig. 2). Therefore, the volumetric flow 
rate ratio (R = 1.2) in the saturator temperature range of 313.2 K to 353.2 K, the compositions of CO2 
 12
PMMA formed larger particles, the particle size distributions were also broad (PDI = 1.37, 120 kg/mol; 
PDI = 1.6, 15 and 350 kg/mol). DSC analysis implemented on untreated polymers is shown in Fig. 9, 
the glass transition temperatures (Tg) of PMMA are 355.2 K, 372.2 K, and 378.2 K (onset) for MWs 
of 15, 120, and 350 kg/mol, respectively. And then, the SAA processed polymer showed no obviously 
different Tg with untreated samples in three MWs of PMMA particles.   
 
3. Precipitation Kinetics 
3.1 Population balance equation  
The modeling of the SAA process is required for rationally design, optimize and estimate the 
precipitation behavior of the SAA process. The population balance theory is widely used to 
determinate the nucleation and growth parameters for a precipitation process, and can be a valuable 
tool to discern primary or secondary nucleation is dominant [16]. Jarmer et al. [7], Wu et al. [8] and 
Boutin [9] successfully correlated their precipitation experiment results for the SAS process with the 
population balance equation for a mixed-suspension, mixed-product-removal (MSMPR) precipitator. 
The following assumptions were made for an MSMPR crystallizer: no crystals were in the feed stream, 
all crystals were the same shape and characterized by a chosen linear dimension L, no break-down of 
crystals occurred, a well-mixed crystallizer with mixed product removal (no classification at 
withdrawal) were at steady-state. Thus, for an MSMPR crystallizer, the population balance equation is 
simplified as well-known exponential population distribution 
( )[ ]τGLnn o /exp −=    (1) 
where no is the population density of nuclei (i.e., the size is close to zero), G is the particle growth rate, 
and τ is the mean residence time of the mixed suspension. If the particle size distribution of a sample 
follows Eq. (1), the logarithmic population density (ln n) should vary linearly with particle size (L) and 
the kinetic parameters, ln no and -1/Gτ, which can be determined from the intercept and the slope, 
respectively. By definition, the nucleation rate Bo is then calculated from 
GnB oo =  (2) 
The original particle size distribution (e.g., Fig. 5) must be converted into the population density n 
(L) prior to proceeding with the analysis of precipitation kinetics. The population density in each size 
interval can be determined [16] by 
 14
The data points used in the correlation are adjusted to obey the constraint. Typically, the data points of 
smaller sizes are discarded in the data fitting.  
While the value of Gτ is obtained from the above fitting, the mean residence time τ should further 
be specified to calculate the growth rate G. It could be estimated from

TFF
V
+=τ   (8) 
where Vmixing is the mixing volume, the volume of injected polymer solution within one second was 
assumed as a reference value of Vmixing in each run and the relative growth rate G was thus calculated, 
as shown in Table 4. Uchida et al. [18] measured the growth rates of a naphthalene single crystal in 
supercritical carbon dioxide. According to their experimental results, the growth rates were in the 
range of (10-7 to 10-8) m/s, falling between those in the liquid phase (10-5 m/s - 10-7 m/s) and in the 
vapor phase (< 10-8 m/s) at the same supersaturation. The calculated relative growth rates, as listed in 
Table 4, are in the order of magnitude of 10-7 m/s, which are comparable to the literature values [18]. 
Furthermore, the calculated nucleation rates Bo (= no G), also listed in Table 4, are in the range of (0.80 
to 3.52) x 1019 no./s m3. Compared, with the results from other studies, such as Muhrer et al. [19] (the 
gas anti-solvent process, GAS, 1014 no./s m3), Weber et al. [20] and Turk [21] (the rapid expansion of 
supercritical solutions, RESS, 1020-32 no./s m3), Jarmer et al. [7] (SAS, 1018 no./s m3), Wu et al. [8] 
(SAS, 1016 - 1017no./s m3) and Boutin [9] (SAS, 1014 - 1019no./s m3), the calculated nucleation rates of 
this study are reasonable.  
Table 4 shows that the growth rate G and the dominant particle sizes (Ld = 3Gτ) increased with 
increasing suspension density MT over run #2 to run #6, in which MT varies 50-fold, from 0.098 to 4.91 
kg/m3, under the same mean residence time. The growth rate (G) of particles was determined from the 
slope (-1/Gτ) in the population density plots. The PDIs ( 3,4d / nod ) of runs #2, #4, and #6 in Table 3 are 
also related to the slope of the population density plots in Fig. 10. A greater PDI value indicates a 
broad particle size distribution and represents a smaller slope in the population density plot or a greater 
growth rate (G) of polymer particles. For example, the SAA prepared sample with the greater 
suspension density MT (run #6) has a board particle size distribution (PDI = 1.9) with a smaller slope 
value or greater growth rate (G = 717 nm/s) of polymer particles. On the contrary, the sample with 
smaller suspension density (run #2) has a narrow particle size distribution (PDI = 1.5) with a smaller 
growth rate (G = 323 nm/s) of polymer particles in the SAA process. Additionally, non-parallel lines 
(the different slopes) exhibit on the population density plots for runs #2, #4, and #6, as shown in Fig. 
10. This suggests that the different size distribution can be achieved by changing the suspension 
 16
Sub-micrometric particles of PMMA were produced via a supercritical assisted-atomization (SAA) 
process using acetone as a solvent and supercritical carbon dioxide as a spraying medium. The lower 
concentrations of polymer solution and higher temperatures at the saturator were determined to be 
favorable for reducing the PMMA particle size. At the optimized volumetric flow rate ratios, the 
composition of CO2 in the feed streams was near the bubble points of the saturator temperatures. The 
MSMPR population balance equation is capable of representing the precipitation kinetics. Reasonable 
values of the nucleation rates and growth rates were obtained from the data correlation. As evidenced 
from the experimental data analysis, it was suggested that the primary nucleation was dominant in the 
SAA precipitation, and that the growth of the polymer particles was governed by diffusion, rather than 
surface integration.

(英文) The present discloses a method for producing sub-micrometric particles of several 
materials. The supercritical fluid is used as a spraying medium. The carbon dioxide 
mixture that was dissolved in the solute solution was sprayed through a nozzle to produce 
atomization of finely liquid droplets. Upon contact of the heated nitrogen, the solvent of 
the droplets evaporated and then the ultra-finely particles formed due to the 
supersaturation of the solute. This method can produce sub-micrometric particles with a 
higher yield and be applicable to organic solution or aqueous solution. The mean particle 
size and particle size distribution can tailored by the process conditions, included the 
spray angle of nozzle, concentration of solute solution, saturator temperature and 
volumetric flow rate ratio of carbon dioxide to solute solution.
