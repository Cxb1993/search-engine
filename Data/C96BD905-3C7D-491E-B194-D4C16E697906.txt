Introduction
In the first year of this three-year project, we have successfully used molecular
dynamics simulations to determine the structure, energetic, and vibrational (Infrared)
properties of PTT both in the crystalline and in the amorphous state. Based on this
foundation, we have now moved forward to study the crystallization process of PTT
under thermal (cooling) and stress (drawing) treatments. Our focus in the past (second)
year was to investigate the mechanism of PTT crystallization whiling cooling it from
its melt.
In classical theory of nucleation, the crystallization of a material when cooled to
a temperature below its melting point is generally recognized to be a two-stage
process. In the stage of primary nucleation, crystal nuclei (clusters comprising ordered
molecules) appear and re-dissolve via molecular collisions until the size of a nucleus
reaches some critical value, above which the nuclei are thermodynamically stable.
The subsequent growth of the critical nuclei follows kinetic mechanism and is
classified as secondary nucleation. Complicated by additional constraints in
topological connectivity, the crystallization in polymers presents remarkable
differences both in the nucleation and in the growth periods when compared to that in
small molecules. While extensive experimental [1-4] and theoretical [5-7] efforts are
made to verify and explain the molecular mechanism in the growth of nuclei in
polymeric materials, the primary stage of polymer crystallization is less well
understood. Recent works [8-14] show that there exist nucleus precursors prior to the
formation of crystal nuclei. While such existence of nucleus precursors is criticized by
some researchers [15-17], some believed that the precursors may be the reason for
memory effects in polymeric materials [18]. Simulation work of Gee et al. [19]
provided an unambiguous evidence of precursor formation as polymer melts are deep
quenched into the unstable region where spinodal decomposition starts.
Our recent atomistic molecular dynamic simulations reveal the formation and
growth of highly oriented but loosely packed clusters upon quenching a melted
poly(trimethylene terephthalate). Unlike the work of Gee et al., here we show that
such precursors may occur much earlier as soon as the polymer enters the metastable
region. The formation of the precursors is found to be rapid and may play an
important role as an incubator for crystal nuclei formation.
Simulation Details
Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to study the precrystallization
process of poly(trimethylene terephthalate), PTT (whose chemical structure is shown
in Fig. 1). PTT, a member of aromatic polyesters, exhibits outstanding elastic
recovery and resiliency properties over its homologous sisters PET and PBT. The
molecular models of PTT are prepared using commercial package Cerius2 [20]. Each

3.1 Definition of nucleus precursor
To detect and quantify any structural development, we define the nucleus
precursors in the system as follows. (1) A segment of PTT is defined to be the vector
pointing from the center of an aromatic ring to the next aromatic ring on the same
polymer chain (green cylinders in Fig. 1). (2) Adjacent segments are defined as those
whose distance between center of mass fall within 9 Å. [note the lengths of a PTT
crystal unit cell are 4.64, 6.27, and 18.64 Å] (3) Two adjacent segments whose
included angles are within 10 degrees are marked as mutually parallel. (4) A nucleus
precursor is identified as a cluster containing mutually parallel segments. Based on
this definition, we may easily determine the number ns of nucleus precursors
containing s parallel segments at any instant of time in the course of dynamic
simulation. For example, the precursors identified from the NPT simulation at 400K
are illustrated in Fig. 4 for 6 time instants. In the beginning of the simulation (e.g. 62
ps) most of the segments are disordered (in yellow). Several medium sized clusters
(magenta, pink, red) start to form and some of them may continue to grow to a highly
temperature (K)

Our atomistic molecular dynamic simulations reveal the formation and growth of
highly oriented but loosely packed clusters (nucleus precursors) upon quenching a
melted semi-rigid polymer, poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT). While extensive
experimental and theoretical efforts are made to verify and explain the molecular
mechanism in the growth of nuclei in polymeric materials, the primary stage of
polymer crystallization is less well understood. Recent studies show that there exist
nucleus precursors prior to the formation of crystal nuclei, and the simulation work of
Gee et al. (2006) provided an unambiguous evidence of precursor formation as
polymer melts are deep quenched into the unstable region where spinodal
decomposition starts.
Here we show that such precursors may occur much earlier as soon as the polymer
enters the metastable region. The temperature dependence of the local ordering
(precrystallinity) caused by the formation of nucleus precursors resembles that of
nucleation rate in common polymers. The growth of the precursor is found to be quite
rapid, with the Avrami rate constant being, 8.16×107 s-0.9, and the precrystallinity
