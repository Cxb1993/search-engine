Abstract 
 
The recent popular tumor diagnosis like 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) needs the 
judgment of experienced doctors. Even the 
developer, such as magnetic nano-particles 
(MNPs), have been utilized to enhance the 
image contrast, the expensive MRI is difficult to 
populate. This project is to utilize bioprobe 
magnetic nanoparticles for magnetic labeling 
malignant cell / tumor, and then examine and 
image MNPs for tumor diagnosis. However, the 
metabolism model should be found first to 
distinguish circulation from targeting to the 
target organs. Therefore to study that 
electromagnetic waves influence MNPs is found 
at first for inducing larger magnetic response 
under the harmless excitation of electromagnetic 
waves. Besides, the integration of an economic 
and high-sensitive high-Tc Superconducting 
Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) with a 
suitable excitation/sensing coil or antenna is 
developed as different biomedical examination 
instruments to measure the magnetic response of 
few MNPs. For example, Scanning SQUID 
Biosusceptometry (SSB) was successfully 
developed for noninvasive in-vivo and in-vitro 
tests. And feasibilities of the metabolism model 
of MNPs without bioprobes and the targeting 
model of MNPs with bioprobes were proved by 
the comparisons with the results of biopsy and 
high-field MRI, separately. Besides a low-field 
MRI SQUID system was found to realize the 
feasibility of MNPs in low-field MRI.

四、 結果與討論 
本計畫先開發一個將靈敏的高溫超導量
子干涉儀維持於液態氮中的子單元系統,該超
導量子干涉儀亦被一個銅線繞製的線圈套住,
並因應不同生醫感測的目的先進行以下兩種
系統的開發: 
 
(一) 掃瞄式超導量子干涉儀系統(Scanning 
SQUID Biosusceptometry, SSB): 
製作兩個 D-shape 反繞的感應線圈以對
抗雜訊,使在無屏蔽環境下亦可感測。而
在使該感應線圈與超導量子干涉儀外的
線圈連接後有最佳的訊號轉移倍率後,
亦調整在使該 double D-shape 感應線圈
外的激發線圈以有最佳激發效果(達到
遠距離的磁場分佈,及平面場均勻於中
心)。上述部份為系統探頭部份,並與超導
量子干涉儀子系統（由超導量子干涉儀
屏蔽於屏蔽桶中）以磁通量轉移(flux 
coupling)概念構成完整的掃瞄式超導量
子干涉儀系統，其示意圖(圖四) 。

該系統不僅可利用步進馬達掃瞄動物身
體(in-vivo test),也可在解剖動物後取出
的檢體 ,裝置於玻璃容器後進行量測
(in-vitro test)。為驗證該系統具生醫應用
上追蹤動物體內磁性奈米粒子的可行
性，以下則分別就建立磁性奈米粒子於
動物體內的代謝模式與磁性診斷磁性奈

究。 
 
(A)代謝模式: 
   a. in-vivo test 
      取 3隻 5週大的 Wistar老鼠,於尾巴靜
脈注射磁性奈米流體(0.9 emu/g,0.3 c.c.),
以進行感測不同器官內的磁性奈米粒子,
其實驗流程如圖五。量測結果如圖六所示, 
心臟處的濃度開始上昇及減少比肝臟處早
(~1 hr vs. ~ 2 hr),且心臟處的最大濃度比
肝臟處的最大濃度高,應是肝臟處有大部
份的巨噬細胞。且根據藥物動力學進一步
分析各參數的差異(CV)~30 %，與相關文
獻接近(~30% or more),這些結果對於磁性
奈米粒子應用於藥物攜帶及腫瘤磁性標記
方面的研究相當重要。 
此外，亦將檢體以普魯式藍染色觀察鐵在各臟
器組織上的分佈，如圖八(a)。圖八(b)則顯示
各臟器的藍色點(表示 Fe3+離子)隨時間於分佈
為 2小時達高峰，但 8小時候逐漸減少。表示
8小時內磁性奈米粒子逐漸透過血液循環到各
臟器，並在肝臟等被巨噬細胞分解，而 8小時
候則各鐵離子逐漸被代謝離開各臟器。

而為了證實上述磁性奈米粒子的假說，我們
進一步將 in-vitro test的老鼠血液送不同

物施打一次其標靶用的磁流體後，可以先以
SSB進行快速的篩檢，如超音波檢測於門診或
小診所即可進行，而檢測陽性者亦可於較長的

犧牲後，以普魯式藍染色觀察鐵離子的分佈，
發現注射 anti-AFP磁流體後 21 hr的腫瘤組
織中鐵離子的分佈最多，但隨時間遞減。而同
樣在 24 hr，注射無生物探針的磁流體之腫瘤
組織卻與無注射的腫瘤組織一樣無鐵離子的

Abstract—To determine the iron concentration of administrated magnetic nano-particles in animals is essential for 
evaluation of arrival efficiency in target regions in biomagnetism studies. In this work, a high Tc superconucting quantum 
interference devices (SQUID) biosusceptometry with a scanning coil set is developed. The measurement principal is based on 
the AC susceptibility of magnetic nano-particles, and the low noise of 8 pT/√Hz at 400 Hz is characterized in unshielded 
environment. The dextran-coated magnetic nano-particle of 50 nm in diameter is administrated intravenously into Wistar 
male rats to demonstrate the in-vivo and fast examination feasibility of this instrument. The in-vivo results of heart region 
and liver region explained the reasonable biological phenomenon of magnetic nano-particles in animals.  Good correlation 
of concentration-time curve between the induction-coupled-plasma (ICP) and in-vivo examination by AC susceptibility 
measurement in rat liver region until 4 hours after injection of magnetic naoparticle validates the in-vivo measurement of 
iron concentration. After 4 hrs post magnetic nanoparticle injection, the phagocyted magnetic nano-particles in liver tissue 
shows antiferromagnetism properties and explain the difference between the low in-vivo intensity by AC susceptibility 
measurement and high intensity by ICP .  
Index Terms—SQUID, in-vivo, magnetic nano-particle, antiferromagnetism 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
    HE balance of the iron amount in living organism is important because deficiency or excess of 
iron related to many biological reactions and results in many diseases. Blood sampling for iron level 
determination is the current diagnostic method for iron metabolism. But this method only provides 
indirect information regarding the iron metabolism in the body and could not actually measure the 
tissue or organ iron level. Although liver biopsy could actually measure tissue iron level, but this 
method is an invasive procedure and carry some risk.   For development of non-invasive 
biosusceptometry to measure tissue iron level, SQUID sensor may be ideal for this purpose due to 
its superior magnetic sensitivity. In development of SQUID Biosusceptometry[1], many inevitable 
disadvantages present, including complex operation process, consumption of manpower for the 
patient preparation under Deware as well as high cost of liquid helium maintenance.  Therefore it 
is not widely used in biomedicine diagnosis. 
Magnetic nano-particles of iron complex are widely applied in biomagnetism applications, such 
as cell separation[2], hyperthermia tumor treatment [3], MRI[4], drug delivery, tumor diagnosis [5] 
and immunoassay [6], etc. Among them, the first important issue is to monitor the dynamic 
distribution and concentration of magnetic nano-particles in target region for confirming the desire 
biological effect. The measurment method of dynamic scanning along animal torsos just like 
scanning of ultrasound probe may be an easy and practical method.  
     Generally, SQUID systems are senstive enough for detecting ultra-low iron concentration, 
even in high Tc SQUI D system still have sensitivity of several pT.  But the detection distance 
between the sample and SQUID sensor is critial for the sensitivity. The unavoidable distance of the 
system, like vacuum gap, wall thickness of Dewar and cryostat reduce system sensitivity. Besides 
anti-noise shielding and anti-vibration have make SQUID systems to be a huge machine. The 
examination is performed with the movement of the sample instead of machine and this method is 
inconvenience in clinical examination.  
    To improve such operation drawbaks, the typical technology of transfer coil [7] is proposed to separate the sample 
unit and the SQUID sensor using a set of pickup coils/ excitation coils for sensing/excitating and an input coil for 
transferring. Actually it has been validated in many SQUID systems for biomagnetism fields, such as 
magnetocardiogram (MCG) system [8], nondestructive evaluation (NDE) system [9-10], magnetoreduction assay 
(MRA)[11-12], etc. Among them, the structure of the input coil surrounding the SQUID sensor is generally similar, but 
the structures of the pickup coil are different with the application requirements. In this work, based on these transfer coil 
than out-of-phase component Bout-of-phase is used because the intensity increase postiviely while the coil set is closing to 
the torso.  
After these pre-alignment steps, the coil set is statically measuring the heart or liver regions on its best position for a 
short time, and then the study dose of magnetic fluids was injected into the tail vein. The tests on heart and livers region 
for long-term static measurements were performed in 3 rats per test. By averaging the heart and liver signal of the three 
rats for the time interval of 0.1 hr to remove the random noise, the mean value with the coefficient of variance (CV) was 
plotted in Fig.2 (a).  Here, the normalization B was defined as i phase,in i phase,inphasein B/)B(B −−− − , where the suffix 
in-phase indicated the in-phase component of the intensity, and i was representative of the average value before 
injecting magnetic fluids except time while the rat struggled. It showed that the signal trend of these organ regions rose 
initially and then returned to its initial level. The liver peaking at 2 hrs was later than the heart at 1hr. This finding could 
be explained by the relative large blood component in heart and Kuffer cell uptake of magnetic nanoparticle in late 
stage in liver.  
In order to verify the in-vivo results, the liver tissue was sent for Prussian blue test in Laboratory Animal Center, 
National Taiwan University. Rats were sacrificed at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 hrs after injecting the same dose of magnetic 
nanoparticles and 3 rats per every time point, and another 3 control group rats too. The blue spots in Fig.2 (b) were 
representative of Fe3+ ions from the biodegraded magnetic nano-particles. The more magnetic nano-particles the more 
blue spots. It showed that the densest blue spots occurred in 2 hrs post-injection. This agreed with the in-vivo results.  
Furthermore, to demonstrate the feasibilty of the dynamic scanning, the coil set is continuously moved between the 
best position of liver region and heart region repeately. Fig.2(c) shows the dynamic distributions in these organ regions 
and showed a good agreement with the statical results.

IRON CONCENTRATION 
In order to quantity and verify the in-vivo results of liver region by this developed instrument, 
the ex-vivo ICP tests, the gold standard methodology in biomedicine field, is also done. Rats were 
sacrificed at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 hrs after injecting the same dose in 3 rats per time point, and another 
3 control group rats too. The liver tissue of 0.1 g weight is solved entirely in HNO3 solution 0f 65 %

CONCLUSION 
The scanning SQUID biosusceptometry is demonstrated for in-vivo examination of iron concentration. By injecting 
magnetic nano-particles into rats, the distribution of magnetic nano-particles in heart and liver regions is obtained by 
this developed instrument, and that in liver region is verified by light microscopy. The measurement has good 
correlation to  gold standard methodology in biomedicine field, ICP. It indicates the iron concentration of magnetic 
nanoparticles as well as  ferritin in liver tissue is able to be obtained by in-vivo and fast measurement by this 
developed instrument.

Abstract: Recently the works of the in-vivo magnetic labeling using the 
magnetic nanoparticles with the bio-probe coating and with 
the medicine are focused. However, whether the magnetic 
particles could reach the target region or be metabolic with 
the blood circulation, the subject needs a high-sensitivity 
instrument, the well-known SQUID, to track the magnetic 
nanoparticles within the body.However, the current SQUID 
systems in traditional scheme of direct sensing necessarily 
examine patients in expensive shielding room. And the 
patients are in uneasy posture in order to close the sensing 
region of this instrument. The drawbacks of complicate 
operation and high cost increase the population difficulty. 
This work shows the in-vivo and ex-vivo results of the rats 
injected by magnetic fluids by the novel scheme using high 
T
c
 SQUID system. In this system, there are two parts, a 
handy probe composed of excitation and pickup coils, and a 
SQUID unit with the SQUID sensor surrounded by the input 
coil linked to the pickup coil. And the sensitivity of this 
system is as high as several pT at several hundred Hz. The 
doctors could operate it like ultrasonic instruments 
transferring the signal of the sensing probe to PC user 
interface. The operating could be in shielding environment, 
and the manufacturing and maintenance cost are not high. 
So it has the potential to populate in the laboratories, clinics 
and hospitals.
