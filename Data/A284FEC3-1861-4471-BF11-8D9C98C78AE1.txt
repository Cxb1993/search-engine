2An Analytical Method for Locating the Secondary Instant Centers of
Indeterminate Planar Linkages (I)
Abstract
This report presents the first year’s results of the research project of developing a
new analytical method for locating the secondary instant centers of indeterminate
planar linkages. In this report, the secondary instant centers are first discriminated into
three classes according to their level of geometric dependencies. The concepts of
instant-center digraph, instant-center walk, and instant-center circuit are then
introduced to establish the recursive relationships between the classified instant
centers.
Keywords: instant center; indeterminate linkage; graph theory; analytical method
4On the other hand, Gilmore and Cipra have developed an analytical method by
using the vector loop closure equations and the idea of mechanism inversion to find
the instant centers, centrodes, inflection circles, and centers of curvature of planar
linkages [6]. Yan and Hsu have also utilized the velocity matrix to determine the
location of unknown instant centers of complex mechanisms [7]. These methods do
not rely on the Aronhold-Kennedy theorem and they are applicable to any planar
mechanism including the indeterminate ones, but they require the evaluation of the
derivatives of the vector loop closure equations of the mechanism to obtain the
relative instant center of each pair of the movable links. Therefore it would be
elaborate to use if the mechanism contains several coupled kinematic loops or only
the locations of certain set of instant centers are required to be evaluated.
Based on the fact that the location of the instant centers of a single DOF planar
linkage are independent of the selection of the input joint and its velocity; a new
analytical method for locating the instant centers of indeterminate linkages which
does not rely on any velocity information or graphical techniques is proposed in this
research project. The proposed method consists of two parts and will be respectively
developed in two years’time. In this first year’s report, the secondary instant centers
of a given linkage are first classified into three classes according to the level of their
geometric dependencies. Based on this classification and the use of the circle diagram,
a directed graph, referred as the instant-center digraph, is introduced to discriminate
the recursive relationships between the secondary instant centers. The breadth-first
search algorithm is then applied to the graph for finding the occurrence sequences,
referred as the instant-center walk, of these instant centers. In addition, a recursive
formula for successively computing the coordinates of the instant centers in an
instant-center walk is established.
6corresponding to it can be ascertained from Figure 2. Finally, the SICs of which none
of the corresponding pole-lines can be determined from the PICs are defined as the
third class. It can be observed from Figure 2 that only one among all of the SICs of
the single flier eight-bar linkage is of this class and which is I1,6.
It should be noted that, for single DOF planar mechanisms, once the positions of
the first class SICs have been located based on the given configuration of the linkage
and the PICs, they can then be treated as the PICs, and, consequently, the state of
some of the second and/or the third class SICs can be upgraded to that of the first
class and be evaluated accordingly. This process can be carried out repeatedly until
either the position of all of the SICs have been evaluated, or none of the state of the
reminding second and third class SICs can be upgraded. The later case would indicate
that the given linkage is an indeterminate one.
3. Instant-Center Digraph and Instant-Center Walks
In order to further discriminate the dependencies between the undetermined
second and third class SICs of indeterminate linkages, instant-center digraph and the
concept of instant-center walk are introduced in this section.
An instant-center digraph is a directed graph in which the vertices are designated
to the undetermined SICs and are denoted by using the same notation as the SIC. Any
two vertices in the graph having a common subscript, such as Ii,j and Ij,k , may be
connected by an edge, provided that they are not both of the third class SIC and that
the instant center between links j and k is a PIC (i.e. Jj,k). The direction of the edge is
determined according to the following rules:
1. If both of the two vertices are of the second class, then the edge is bidirectional
and is represented by a two-way arrow. This is because, according to the
8for a third class SIC.
The instant-center walk gives a directed relationship between the two end
vertices, and which, as will be shown in the next section, is useful for establishing a
recursive computational scheme to evaluate the coordinates of the unknown instant
centers. It should, however, be noted that the instant-center walk between two given
vertices may not be uniquely defined. Nevertheless, in order to save computation time,
it is desirable to find the walk which consists of the least amount of the intermediate
vertices. This is known as the shortest path problem in the graph theory, which can be
solved by several existing graph-theoretic algorithms. In this paper, the breadth-first
search algorithm is employed to find the shortest instant-center walks [8].
4. Recursive Computational Scheme for Instant-Center Walk
Denoting the instant-center walk between two SICs, Ii,j and Ik,l, as { S1, S2, …, Si-1,
Si, Si+1, …, Sn }, where S1= Ii,j and Sn = Ik,l . Since S2 must be a second class SIC,
therefore one of its pole-line is known, and which can be written into the point-slope
form as
2, 2,y 1 x 1S = m S + c , (1)

In which (p1,x, p1,y) and (p2,x, p2,y) are, respectively, the coordinates of the two PICs P1

2,0 3, 2, 1, 1, 2,( )y x y x yD = p p p p p   .
It should be noted that equations (7) and (8) are derived based on the assumptions that
both the slope of the pole line defined by P1 and P2 and the locations of the PICs are
finite. If p1,x = p2,x then the pole line would be perpendicular to the x axis of the
reference frame and the slope m1 would become infinity. Nevertheless, in this case
equation (1) can be replaced by
xx PS 12  ,
and which can be substituted into equation (4) to find the intersection point of the two
lines. On the other hand, if P3 is the instant center corresponding to a sliding pair as
shown in Figure 6, then it would be located at infinity along the line L which is
perpendicular to the sliding direction of the slider, and the pole-line defined by S1, S2,
and P3 should be parallel to L. Therefore, by using the two-point form, equation (4) in
this case can be modified to

and P6 corresponding to the known pole lines of S2 and S3, as shown in Figure 5.
Consequently, the functional relationship between the coordinates of two
successive SICs, Si and Si-1, i = 2 ~ n, in the given walk, can be written into the
general form as

In addition, if the first instant-center is a second class SIC, then as shown in
Figure 5, it must lies on a known pole line defined by the two PICs, Pq and Pr, such
that
