Abstract in English 
 
Non-water suppression MRS (NWS MRS) 
has several advantages. First, the unsuppressed 
water signal can be used as internal calibration 
for metabolite quantification and as a reliable 
frequency/phase reference for retrospective 
motion correction. Second, it avoids the 
potential artifacts caused by incomplete water 
suppression (WS) and extra RF deposition from 
WS pulses. However, the frequency modulation 
(FM) sidebands originating from  large water 
signal distorts the spectrum. Among the 
methods proposed to solve the problems caused 
by FM sidebands, post-acquisition processing 
methods are superior in flexibility for general 
use compared with experimental methods. We 
propose two algorithms based on advanced 
matrix-decomposition to remove the FM 
sidebands. These methods, simultaneous 
diagonalization algorithm (QZ) and its 
subsequent variant, simultaneously generalized 
Schur decomposition algorithm (SGSD), were 
numerically evaluated using computer 
simulations. In addition, we quantitatively 
compared the performance of these methods and 
the modulus method in an in vitro experiment 
and in vivo NWS MRS against conventional 
WS data. Our results show that the proposed 
SGSD algorithm can reduce the FM sidebands 
to achieve superior estimation of concentration 
on three major metabolites. This method can be 
directly used to manage spectra pre-acquired 
under various experimental conditions without 
modifying the acquisition sequences. 
 
Keywords: 1H MRS, water suppression, 
frequency modulation sidebands, simultaneous 
diagonalization eigenproblem, post processing 
method. 
 
二、計畫緣由與目的 
 
For in vivo MRS, water suppression (WS) 
(FID), that is, the modulus signal (22). However, 
the main disadvantage of the modulus method is 
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) reduction, which 
is theoretically achieved by a factor of the 
square root of two (20). In addition, the 
magnitude part of the signal may alter the 
spectral shape. 
This study developed novel post processing 
methods using two advanced algebraic 
algorithms for the reduction of FM sidebands in 
NWS MRS and quantitatively compared the 
performance of various post processing methods. 
The novel post processing methods were 
devised with the simultaneous diagonalization 
algorithm (QZ) and the simultaneously 
generalized Schur decomposition (SGSD) 
algorithm to obtain eigenvalues and 
eigenvectors. The SGSD algorithm is expected 
to consistently decompose multiple matrices 
(more than two) simultaneously, thereby 
fostering numerical stability. Computer 
simulations were performed to evaluate the 
performance of the proposed methods. 
Quantitative comparisons were conducted 
among various post processing methods for data 
acquired either in vitro or in vivo. 
 
三、材料與方法 
 
The FM sidebands can be expressed as 
multiple pairs of symmetrical sidebands with 
opposite phases. The FID of the water signal 
can be expressed by the following formula (19)

where A is the amplitude of the water; mf is the 
modulation index that is mainly contributed by 
spoiling gradients. The contribution from slice 
selective gradients can be negligible (18). ωc is 
the water frequency (the carrier); ωG is the 
modulating frequency. In Eq. [1], the signal is 
expressed as the combination of the main water 
peak (first term in Eq. [1]) located at the center 
of spectrum and numerous harmonic signals 
presented as sidebands on the spectrum. The 
coefficients of successive terms are the Bessel 
functions for n-th order harmonics, Jn(mf). 
Because mf is small, the higher order Bessel 
function (n>1) can be approximated to zero. For 
example, the second order Bessel function 
J2(5×10-6) = 3.1×10-12. Therefore, we can apply 
narrow band approximation to the FM part. FM 
sidebands can be separated from the water 
signal as (Eq.[2]):

where ωm represents ωc – ωG. Because the main 
water signal is located around the center of the 
spectrum, ωc can be assumed to be zero and ωm 
is equal to –ωG. In summary, the FID, including 
signals from the water, metabolites, and FM 
sidebands can be expressed as (Eq.[3]): 
)sin()(2)()()()(ˆ 1
*2/ tmJAeitstststs mf
Tt
FM ω−⋅+≈+= −  
where )(ts  represents the summation of water 
and metabolites without FM sidebands. Thus, 
our goal is to differentiate )(ts  from )(tsFM . 
According to Eq. [3], the signal of FM 
sidebands are purely imaginary. Therefore, the 
first step in our method is to modify the 
weighting of real and imaginary parts through a 
factor ∆. In this manner, the real part is 
increased by the factor (1+∆), whereas the 
imaginary part is attenuated by the factor (1-∆), 
yielding (Eq.[4]): 
)()1()()(

∆−+⋅∆+=
⋅∆−+⋅∆−+∆+=
⋅∆−+∆+=∆  
The alterations of the signal as a function 
of ∆ can be separated into three parts. First, 
)(ts  remains unchanged regardless of ∆; 
second, the complex conjugated part of )(ts  
increases by ∆ and mirroring peaks occur 
according to increasing variation of ∆; third, the 
FM sidebands )(tsFM  are reduced by a 
weighting factor (1-∆), and are completely 
eliminated when ∆=1. Specifically, by tracking 
the alterations of amplitudes versus ∆, these two 
parts (the conjugate part and FM sidebands) can 
be differentiated. In this manner, the behavior of 
each term is predictable and the amplitudes of 
FM sidebands vary in a direction opposite to 
factor ∆. This enables us to track the alteration 
of each spectral peak at various ∆. Once the 
signal alteration opposite to ∆ is found, we can 
extract and remove the FM sidebands. 
To extract FM sidebands, we used a 
time-domain approach to obtain the potential 
resonances on the spectrum, also known as 
poles. In brief, we incorporated signals from Eq. 
[4] into the generalized eigenproblem (GEP). 
Subsequently, we used the extended QZ 
algorithm and SGSD algorithm to solve GEP by 
simultaneous triangularization (23-26). The 
generated as (Eq.[9]): 
[ ] [ ]TAAA CRLBACRLB ∆+−××∆+−∆= ′ 1,11,1

,22ˆ
 
 The diagonal elements of the middle terms 
represent the CRLB of A’ and A. However, 
because the off-diagonal elements of the 
covariance matrices were unknown, a 
reasonable upper bound of the off-diagonal 
covariance was derived by (Eq.[10]): 
)2,2()1,1()1,2()2,1( ,,,, AAAAAAAA CRLBCRLBCRLBCRLB ′′′′ ×<=  
This indicates that the lower bound in Eq. [9] 
can be treated as an approximation of CRLB. 
The assumption for the deduction is that the 
noises are sufficiently small to validate the 
linearity within a narrow region. 
 Monte Carlo simulations were performed 
to compare the numerical performance of QZ 
and SGSD. Three poles with a damped factor of 
0.01 (i.e., T2* = 10 msec) were simulated as 
three metabolites. The frequencies of these 
metabolites were -50 Hz, -100 Hz, and -150 Hz. 
Additional peaks were simulated symmetrically 
around the center with opposite phases as the 
FM sidebands. The frequency was 200 Hz and 
-200 Hz. Only first order FM sidebands were 
simulated because the higher order terms were 
small. The biases and variances of the estimator 
in Eq. [7] were evaluated at various noise levels 
with data lengths of 32 and 128. The CRLB was 
calculated from Eq. [10]. All simulations were 
performed using MATLAB software 
(MathWorks, Natick, MA). Simulations were 
repeated 500 times. SNR was defined in units of 
decibel as the signal power over noise variances

Experiments on human participants and a 
spectroscopy phantom were performed using a 
3T MRI scanner (Trio, Siemens Medical 
Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) with an 
8-channel coil array. For in vivo experiments, 11 
healthy participants were enrolled in this study 
under informed consent. A single voxel point 
resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) sequence was 
used to acquire MRS data from a selected 
volume (20×20×20 mm3) located at the parietal 
lobe in the brain (Fig. 2) with the following 
experimental parameters: TE=30 ms, TR=2000 
ms, Number of excitation (NEX) = 128, dummy 
scan =2, bandwidth = 2000 Hz, and spectral 
points = 2048. In the PRESS sequence, we used 
sinc type RF pulses at a duration of with 2.6 ms 
for excitation and refocusing. Two sets of 
spoiler gradients were incorporated around the 
two refocusing RF pulses. For these two spoiler 
gradients, the strengths were 7 mT/m and 11.5 
mT/m in each direction, and the durations were 
2 ms and 4 ms, respectively. NWS and WS 
scans were collected sequentially for each 
participant. Shimming and frequency 
adjustments of the WS pulse were performed 
cautiously to enable the WS MRS data to serve 
as a standard without influence from FM 
sideband artifacts. To observe the properties of 
FM sidebands and evaluate the performance of 
post processing methods, additional data were 
collected from a spectroscopic phantom 
containing a mixture of metabolite solutions, 
including 3 mM choline (8), 12 mM creatine 
(Cre), 18 mM N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), 7 mM 
myo-Inositol (mI), and 12 mM glutamate (Glu). 
NWS and WS MRS data were acquired using a 
single voxel PRESS sequence with the 
following experimental parameters: TE= 30 ms 
and 80 ms, TR= 2000 ms, volume= 20×20×20 
mm3, NEX= 256, dummy scan= 2, bandwidth= 
2000 Hz, and spectral points = 2048. 
Once the data were acquired, FIDs from 8 
coils were combined after adjustment for phases 
and amplitude (32). NWS data were processed 
using four differing procedures for the reduction 
of FM sidebands, including regular NWS MRS 
without reduction of FM sidebands, NWS MRS 
with QZ algorithm to remove FM sideband, 
NWS MRS with SGSD algorithm to remove 
FM sideband, and modulus NWS MRS. The 
process for SGSD and QZ methods focused on 
the up-field range in which most of the 
metabolites reside. Subsequently, all MRS data, 
including NWS and WS data, were transferred 
into jMRUI package (java-based Magnetic 
Resonance User Interface, Leuven, Belgium) for 
spectral processing and analysis. A 5Hz 
Lorentzian function was used for apodization. 
Extraction of water signals for all NWS spectra 
was performed using singular value 
decomposition (SVD)-based algorithm (14) 
repeatedly to visually flatten the distorted 
spectra. The frequency shift, damping factor, 
background distortion, and amplitudes of six 
metabolites, including total choline (tCho), Cre, 
Glu, Glutamine (Gln), mI, and NAA, were 
and modulus methods. For NAA, tCho, and Cre 
on the 11 participants, the metabolite 
concentrations measured from spectra with FM 
sidebands corrected using the SGSD method 
exhibited the optimal estimation for its smallest 
percentage errors, as shown in Fig. 6B. In 
addition, we quantified mI, Glu, and Gln, which 
were composed of several multiplets. All three 
correction methods included in this study failed 
to retain the spectral shapes. 
We developed novel post-acquisition 
processing methods to reduce FM sidebands in 
the NWS MRS and quantitatively compared the 
performance of three methods on both in vivo 
and in vitro experiments. The proposed methods 
were implemented using two algorithms, QZ 
and SGSD, which perform decomposition of a 
data matrix with reconstruction. The 
performance of the modulus method and the 
proposed methods was evaluated using in vitro 
results using a true reference and in vivo results 
using WS MRS as a reference. Our in vitro 
results show that the modulus and SGSD 
methods improve the accuracy of quantification 
for NAA and Cre. The SGSD method provides 
superior estimation in tCho (Table 1). Our in 
vivo results show that FM sidebands can be 
alleviated (Fig. 5) to restore the spectral peaks 
for superior estimation of concentrations on 
three major metabolites (Fig. 6). In addition, the 
SGSD method exhibited superior accuracy to 
the QZ method and the modulus method. 
Because the proposed methods are purely 
post-processing algorithms, substantial changes 
of pulse sequences or specific experimental 
design involving additional phantom scan are 
not required. In general, our algorithm can be 
fitted into other experimental methods to 
improve the efficiency of FM sideband 
suppression. 
One of the main advantages of NWS MRS 
is the potential to perform motion correction and 
quantification simultaneously (7), with the FM 
sidebands occuring as an additional source of 
error for spectral quantification. If the profile of 
FM sidebands can be initially gathered at 
various locations for follow-up adjustment as an 
analogy of the use of external reference (12), the 
efficiency of the removal of FM sidebands can 
be improved considerably. However, external 
referencing is feasible only if the scanning 
condition in the reference scan is similar to in 
vivo tissue environments. Otherwise, the FM 
sidebands may not be fully removed. In the 
presence of motion, the possible phase 
alternation during the scan leads to 
inconsistency between the external reference 
and scanning condition. A previous study that 
performed additional calibration with an 
external reference indicated that, because the 
power of water was lowered to 10.8% of the 
original signal,  at least 10% errors occurred 
for quantification in NWS MRS (12). These 
potential errors caused by external referencing 
methods in the presence of FM sidebands must 
be considered for clinical application. In this 
case, the use of post-processing approaches for 
FM sideband removal is favorable. 
According to the phantom results, the 
modulus and SGSD methods outperformed the 
QZ method in the estimation of absolute and 
relative concentrations. Although these methods 
have comparable errors in absolute 
concentrations of NAA and Cre, overestimation 
in NAA and underestimation in Cre using the 
QZ method leads to larger errors in NAA/Cre. 
Relative quantification using Cre as a reference 
is generally used in several clinical applications. 
However, our results indicate that the 
quantification of Cre is affected by the FM 
sidebands. Uncertainties remain in the 
estimation of Cre (Table 1), even after FM 
sideband reduction. This leads to additional 
errors when using relative concentrations. 
Therefore, we suggest that water scaling must 
be used in NWS MRS for the quantification of 
concentrations. The extraction of water signals 
is relatively stable for its intrinsically higher 
SNR. This makes a water signal suitable as a 
reference signal. 
A property of SGSD and QZ is that the 
estimation of poles, especially during the 
extraction of FM contribution, is sensitive to 
noise disturbance, line width, and baseline 
distortion. Therefore, these factors can influence 
the performance of SGSD and QZ. Although the 
simulation shows that the performance of the 
SGSD method is close to the theoretical limits 
set by the CRLB (Fig. 3D), the in vivo results 
generally digress from ideal conditions because 
of field inhomogeneity, which can be 
particularly prominent in intricate tissues. A 
previous study indicated that the efficiency of 
the reduction of FM sidebands is influenced by

Introduction 
Human meniscus plays an important role on maintenance of the knee mechanical functions and is strongly associated with early detection of osteoarthritis (OA) 
which is frequently characterized with degeneration of cartilage and mostly related to aging [1]. Quantitative MR T2 measurement provides a noninvasive method 
to evaluate the early change of fiber architecture and water content in menisci and monitor the progression of it [2]. Previous report demonstrated that zonal 
differences in tissue composition and cell metabolism have been observed between the inner and outer areas of the meniscus, also T2 values differed significantly 
between different zones in the posterior horns menisci in the young population [3]. In addition to regional influence, aging and gender may be other factors that 
could affect the diagnostic value of quantitative T2 measurements in the menisci. As a result, the purpose of this study was to determine whether the MR T2 values 
of the knee menisci are variable and whether these variations are related to the different zones of the medial and lateral menisci, in men and women without OA in 
different age populations. 
Method 
Sixty asymptomatic subjects, including three different age groups (young-age, middle-age, and old-age; 10 male, 10 female in each group) were enrolled in this 
study. All volunteers were scanned in a supine position using a 3.0 T MR system (Achieva, Philips, Best, Netherlands). These images were acquired with an 
eight-channel knee coil using fast spin echo sequence with TR = 2500ms, TE = 6.4, 9.4, 12, and 15 ms; echo train length = 3; slice thickness = 1 mm; slice gap = 1 
mm; matrix size = 258 × 324 (zero-filled to 560 × 560); NEX = 2; and acquisition time = 14 min 40 s. Fat suppression was used to improve the contrast of the 
images and derive the T2 value with sufficient accuracy. The ROIs for measurements of the T2 values in the posterior horn of the knee meniscus on the sagittal MR 
images of the first echo included the entire meniscus and the three different zones, which divided the meniscus into three equal parts based on the anatomical 
division as illustrated in Figure 2. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the meniscus image, analysis of the T2 values of knee menisci was conducted on a 
zone-by-zone basis using the least-square single-exponential curve-fitting method. 
Results 
Relationship between T2 values in posterior horns of meniscus and participant age was shown in Fig. 1 The T2 values of the medial menisci increased 
quadratically respect to age, and T2 values of the lateral side increased linearly respect to age. These correlations were both statistically significant (p < 0.05). Fig. 
2 showed gender difference in the T2 values for different zones in the posterior horns of the menisci. Asterisk signs indicate statistical significance between male 
and female (p < 0.05). The white zone in the young population was the only one showing no gender-related difference. In addition, the increasing trend in T2 from 
the white zone, red/white zone, to the red zone was present in all three age groups for both genders. On the other hand, the age-related T2 changing rates from the 
young- to the old-age for female subjects were significantly greater in the white and red/white zones than in the red zone (p = 0.001) as shown in Fig.3 (a), but 
largely similar for male subjects (p = 0.156) in Fig. 3 (b). 
Discussion 
The present study indicated the feasibility of quantitative MR T2 measurements to investigate the aging 
effect on zonal and sex differences of human meniscus. Our findings showed that the T2 value of the 
posterior horns in the meniscus increased with increasing age. The higher T2 values of the menisci are 
thought to reflect possible disruption of the cartilage architecture and consequent changes in water 
content, as shown in the articular cartilage [4]. Moreover, age, gender, location, and zone are all primary 
factors showing influences on MR T2 values in the knee meniscus in asymptomatic subjects. Trends in 
the dependency of T2 on these factors are consistent with literature reports on degenerative abnormalities 
of the meniscus, suggesting that T2 measurements may provide further information toward an 
understanding of the role of meniscus on the development of knee OA.

Introduction 
Dual echo in the steady state (DESS) pulse sequence is a technique that allows simultaneous acquisitions of two 
echoes within one TR. The extended readout gradient for the formation of FID (S+) and echo (S-) signals results in two 
images with distinct contrast behaviors, and its incomplete compensation of the gradient moment provides images 
without banding artifacts as those found in bSSFP imaging. Previous study demonstrates that optimal contrast for 
morphological depiction could be obtained by appropriate selection of the scanning parameter values [1]. In this study, 
we apply DESS imaging to brain functional MRI experiments to investigate the relationship between functional 
contrast and the imaging parameters for S+ and S- images, respectively. Preliminary results from phantom and human 
experiments are reported. 
 
Methods 
The basic structure for the DESS sequence is shown in Figure 1, where a dual-acquisition window is applied. Phantom imaging experiments were performed on a 3.0T 
Siemens Trio system using a 12-channel head coil. The image parameters were 180 mm FOV, 128 by 128 matrix size, 5 mm slice thickness. To examine the signal 
behavior of S+ and S-, different TR (10, 30, and 50 ms) and flip angle (FA) values (5°, 10°, 15°, 25°, 35°, 45°, 55°, 65°, and 70°) were used, where TE+ = T+ = T- and TE- 
= 2TR – T+, and BW = 320 Hz/px. To further examine the relationship of off-resonance effects, as might be encountered in alterations of oxygenation level in the brain, 
on the magnitude and phase signals between S+ and S-, a sweep scan was performed for dataset with TR=10 ms at 45° FA by adjusting the phase angles of RF pulses for 
each DESS scan. 
  Human imaging experiments for the investigation of DESS fMRI sensitivity were performing by acquiring two sets of images with 200 mm FOV, 64 by 64 matrix 
size, 4 slices, 260 Hz/px BW and 10 ms TR at FA of 45° and 70°, respectively. The stimulus was a 5 Hz flashing checkerboard visual stimulus in 4-on/5-off blocks (10 
frames in each block) for 4.26 min. Analysis was performed using T-test in SPM5.  
 
Results 
Figure 2 shows the results from the 27 datasets with varied TRs and FAs, 
where the blue and red colors represent S+ and S- signals, respectively, 
suggesting that larger flip angle leads to larger signal intensities, 
benefiting low-sensitivity experiments such as fMRI. For varying TR, 
longer TR results in larger intensity for S+ but reduced S- signal due partly 
to T2 decay effect (not shown), consistent with a previous study that the 
shortened TR in DESS results in increasing similarity in contrast for the 
FID and echo images [2]. Figure 3a and 3b are the sweep scan results for 
the magnitude and phase images, where the the blue and red lines 
represent the results from S+ and S-, respectively. Only the phase of S- was 
affected by off-resonance frequency.  
Figure 4 demonstrates the visual fMRI results, where 4a-4d are the 
temporal time curve displayed in the percentage of the DESS fMRI signal 
changes at 45° and 70° FA (blue: S+, red: S-), and 4e-4f show the activation maps for visual fMRI near the primary visual cortex at 70° FA. The functional contrast 
estimated from S- was slightly higher than that from S+ at the same flip angle, in agreement with its better sensitivity to off-resonance effects as in Fig.3. Moreover, 
larger functional signal changes were observed at larger FA, which is likely a result from the better SNR as shown in Fig.2. 
 
Discussion and Conclusion 
The preliminary findings suggest that a larger flip angle 
seems to be beneficial for better functional contrast in 
DESS imaging. While the functional contrast for S+ might 
arise from changes in cerebral blood flow, the phase 
variations in the presence of off-resonance may contribute 
at least partially to the functional contrast of S- (Fig. 3b). 
Since the DESS technique shows wide signal profiles with 
no geometric distortion, it may have potential as an 
alternative to EPI and bSSFP for brain fMRI studies. 
Mechanisms responsible for the functional sensitivity of 
DESS observed in the experimental results as well as the 
comparative efficiency are currently being investigated.

Introduction: The PROPELLER-EPI (periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction using EPI 
as signal readout) has been shown useful for diffusion applications with reduced geometric distortion [1]. PROPELLER-EPI 
consists of EPI signal readout with alternating gradient polarities, where the phase inconsistencies between odd and even 
echoes generate oblique N/2 ghost artifact [2] in each rotating blade. A double-FOV reference image can be used for 2D linear 
phase correction with interlaced Fourier transform (FT) for oblique ghost reduction prior to PROPELLER-EPI reconstruction 
[3], which however lengthens the acquisitions substantially because the reference scan needs to be performed for every blade. 
A 2D phase-cycled reconstruction for inherent correction of N/2 ghost without any extra reference scan has been reported 
recently [4], with only minor pitfalls in low-signal regions. For PROPELLER-EPI, the small matrix size along the 
phase-encoding direction further entails modifications of the 2D phase-cycled reconstruction method. In this work, therefore, 
we integrate an improved version of the 2D phase-cycled reconstruction and PROPELLER-EPI, and compare the result to that 
reconstructed using the more time-consuming 2D reference-based method.  
Materials and methods: The 2D phase-cycled reconstruction is an image-domain processing method, which generates a 
series of corrected images from original data by assuming different 2D phase errors, and then selects the correction result with 
lowest artifact based on background energy sorted in decreasing order [4]. In its original implementation, the background is 
defined solely using sigmoid-weighted signals without prior knowledge of object location or shape. Thus the algorithm may 
fail during the sorting operation in places where the object contains signal-free regions along the phase-encoding direction. In 
addition, the number of pixels along the phase-encoding direction in each blade image of PROPELLER-EPI is often too small 
to ensure reliable sorting, leading to signal discontinuity (arrows in Fig.1a). To address both issues, in our study the 2D phase 
cycled reconstruction was applied to interpolated blade image with Fermi-filtering to increase the matrix size while without 
introducing Gibbs ringing (Fig.1b), and a mask operation was used instead of the sorting operation to identify the background 
region. A mask of object shape (object mask) was first produced via PROPELLER reconstruction using only odd echoes of all 
rotating blades (Figs.2a-2b). The mask generation was straightforward because the ghost energy 
was spread to different directions with PROPELLER reconstruction (Fig.2a). In this manner a 
ghost mask could be obtained for each blade by subtracting the object mask with proper rotation 
(Figs.2c-2d), which was then to identify the background region for 2D phase-cycled reconstruction. 
Experimental phantom images to demonstrate our method were acquired at 1.5T (Signa HDxt, GE) 
with FOV 17x17cm, blade size 32*128 (ETL=32), rotating angle 15°, NEX 1, TE 76.8ms, TR 
4000ms, 5mm slices without gap, and 12 blades for 180° k-space coverage. Scan time was 48s. 
The double-FOV reference scans were also acquired for all blades (which took an additional 48s to 
acquire) for purpose of comparison with reference-based correction.   
Results: The single blade images without N/2 ghost correction (Fig.3a), with 2D phase-cycled 
reconstruction using background energy sorting (Fig.3b), and with 2D phase-cycled reconstruction 
using ghost masking (Fig.3c) are shown for an object having prominent signal-free regions. Ghost 
masking was seen to yield much less residual N/2 ghost (arrows). The PROPELLER-EPI 
reconstructed full-resolution images with reference-based 2D linear phase correction using 
interlaced FT and reference-free 2D phase-cycled reconstruction using ghost masking are shown in 
Figs.4a and 4b, respectively, showing comparable quality but twice difference in total scan time.  
Discussion & Conclusion: The key improvement proposed in this study for 2D phase-cycled 
reconstruction is the replacement of energy sorting by ghost masking to identify the background 
region, making use of the property that the N/2 ghosts in PROPELLER reconstructed images, even 
before N/2 ghost correction, are spread to different directions with diluted intensities. The 
interpolation of the low-resolution blade image from 32 to 128 with Fermi-filtering also helped 
reducing the difficulty in generating the ghost mask, although at the expense of longer processing 
time. These improvements facilitated successful application of PROPELLER-EPI to objects with 
substantial portions of signal-free regions. Even for signal-free regions where the ghost mask also 
showed no signals (yellow arrow in Fig.2d), the correction can still be performed by interpolation 
between adjacent phase-encoding-lines because the EPI phase error is a spatially continuous 
function along two dimensions (bottom arrow in Fig.3c). Experimental results show that the final 
full-resolution PROPELLER-EPI image obtained from 2D phase-cycled reconstruction has 
comparable quality compared to that reconstructed with 2D reference scan correction method. Our 
proposed method eliminates the extra acquisition time required for reference scan, which is 
proportional to number of blades (reference scan time = blades x TR). Our method also eliminates 
potential error amplification in the 2D reference scan approach resulting from subject movement 
between reference scan and actual scan. In conclusion, the 2D phase-cycled reconstruction is 
particularly suitable for correcting oblique ghost in PROPELLER-EPI without any need of extra 
reference scan, and thus may broaden the clinical use of the PROPELLER-EPI technique.
