Abstract: 
   
In the second year of this project, there are 
three main subjects studied. The first is the low 
temperature HfO2 prepared by tilted sputtering of 
Hf metal and then followed by nitric acid 
oxidation compensated with anodization in D.I. 
water.  The second is the preparation of high 
quality ultra-thin gate oxides by strain-oxidation 
technique carried out in D.I. water with bent wafer.  
The third is the preparation of Al2O3 high-k 
dielectrics by shadow evaporation of Al film on a 
wafer and then oxidized by nitric acid. The above 
three works are related to low temperature which 
are suitable for low temperature substrate 
applications. 
In the first subject of the low temperature 
HfO2 prepared by tilted sputtering of Hf metal and 
then followed by nitric acid oxidation 
compensated with anodization in D.I. water, the 
wafer is tilted during sputtering to obtain 
continuously distributed thickness in one single 
substrate.  The oxidized HfO2 was compensated 
by anodization in D.I. water to repair the leaky 
path in existing oxides.  The smallest equivalent 
oxide thickness is 19 nm, the effective breakdown 
field is higher than 12 MV/cm, the leakage current 
is low and the reliability is satisfactory for the 
prepared low temperature high-k dielectrics.  
In the second subject of the preparation of 
high quality ultra-thin gate oxides, the method as 
proposed in the first year was continuously 
studied.  Both of p and n type wafers are used for 
comparison.  The leakage currents for MOS(p) 
and MOS(n) structures with oxides prepared by 
strain-oxidation methods are obviously lower than 
those control samples under the same oxide 
thickness. The reliability for the former ones are 
also superior to the latter ones.
