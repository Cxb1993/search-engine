Abstract  
A novel technique of on-line batch processes 
monitoring based on Wavelet-based hidden Markov tree 
(HMT) will be developed. Unlike most of the existing 
batch process monitoring methods for time scale only, 
HMT can not only analyze the measurements at 
multiple scales in time and frequency but also capture 
the clustering and persistence of the statistical 
characteristics for practical measured data. This 
approach provides better noise reduction and less signal 
distortion. In order to conduct the on-line batch 
monitoring without real-time quality measurement at 
the end of batch run, the proposed method can generate 
simple monitoring charts, easily tracking and 
monitoring the occurrence of observable upsets. The 
comparisons of the existing SPC methods that explain 
the advantages of the properties of the newly proposed 
method will also be conducted.

二、計畫緣由與目的 
在批次製程操作的監控上，Nomikos and 
MacGregor (1994)根據多維度的主成分分析法
（ multi-way principle component analysis, 
MPCA ）發展出一套多變數統計製程管制
（multivariate statistical process control）。我們過
去也提出利用時間延遲的視窗發展出批次的動
態主成份分析法及批次的動態部分最小平方
法，探討批次製程的動態行為(Chen and Liu, 
2002)。但由於工廠量測存在著雜訊干擾，且大
部份的操作訊息發生在某一時間區間內。過去己
有研究試圖利用小波分析(wavelet analysis)，進
行訊號分解及去除雜訊。Baskhi (1998) 利用
PCA 與小波理論發展出 Multiscale PCA，其中小
波提供將不同頻率的變數訊號分離，而 PCA 用
以消除變數間的自相關性。Lu et al. (2003) 藉由
小波轉換分頻出訊息的特徵，再利用 PCA 建立
偵錯的統計分析。 
 
然而小波分頻所表現的頻率特徵，具有持續
和聚集兩個特性。因此，Crouse et al. (1998)，利
用 Hidden Markov Model（HMM）機率與統計的
原理，過濾掉小波分頻後的雜訊，還原成較準確
的訊號。此種結合小波分頻和 HMM 機率模式兩
者的優勢，發展出如同樹狀的結構，稱為 Hidden 
Markov tree model（HMT）。本研究將發展
HMT-Based 的批次監控技術，利用 MPCA 去除
批次數據中變數與變數之間的關聯性，由不同批

Abstract—A batch-to-batch and a within-batch optimization
control strategies for the end-point product quality of batch
processes using MPLS-dEWMA models are presented in this
paper. In the batch-to-batch operation, MPLS based dEWMA
(double exponentially weighted moving average) control is done by
applying feedback from the final output quality of the batch
process. It utilizes the information from the current batch to
improve quality for the next batch. In on-line tracking control
within a batch, the MPLS based dEWMA control strategy is
developed to explore the possible adjustments of the future input
trajectories. It fixes up the disturbances just in time instead of
until the next batch run and maintains the specification product
when this batch is finished. The advantage of MPLS is to extract
the strongest relationship between the input and the output
variables in the reduced space of the latent variables model rather
than in the real space of the highly dimensional manipulated
variable trajectories. The proposed technique has been
successfully applied to a simulated batch reactor.

I. INTRODUCTION
Batch processes and their optimal operation are receiving
considerable attention in the areas, such as polymer reactors,
pharmaceutical manufacture, biochemical reactors and
semiconductor processes. Operation of the batch process is
quite different from that of the continuous process, because the
former is characterized by prescribed processing of raw
materials into products in finite duration. There is no steady
state and constant set point around the regulated process. Given
a specified quality of batch processes, products are produced
and their characteristics are significantly affected by the
operating trajectories of the manipulated variables. Therefore,
the design of optimal trajectories and control is critical for
satisfactory performance of the batch process. The batch
process optimization problems have both dynamic and static

constraints and they are the typical dynamic optimization
problem [1]. However, the success or failure of the above
optimization was obtainable based on a reliable and accurate
process model. The long time scale in detailed mechanistic
model development might make these models infeasible for
agile responsive manufacturing whose products were typical
short-lived and of small-volume [2].
With the rapid process on data process technology, statistic
based data pattern recognition opened a new avenue in process
modeling. The development of multivariable statistical
techniques such as multiway principal component analysis and
multiway partial least squares (MPLS) have been applied to
process engineering problems involving profile tracking control
in batch processes [3]. The batch-to-batch and on-line control
strategies are designed by incorporating the information of
previous batches and exploiting the repetitive nature of the
batches and the batch-to-batch correlation of the disturbances.
Because of the lack of in-situ measurements of the product
qualities of interest, the combination of the iterative learning
control and MPLS that overcame the model error was proposed
[3]. The control actions are determined based on different
weights on error data from the past batch only. Because of aging
of the process, the control design cannot compensate for such
process drifts or ramp disturbances. As a result, offset in the
process outputs occurs.
The iterative learning control of batch-to-batch (BtB)
feedback control has been applied in the manufacturing
industries in the past [4]. The BtB control was used because it
could adjust a recipe which contained the setpoints of these
inputs. It was also believed to be able to produce the proper
output product and reduce variability in the output product. The
computed BtB controller is used to reach the desired values or
improve the performance for the next run. Because of aging of
the process, the existing EWMA BtB controllers cannot
compensate for such process drifts or ramp disturbances, so
offset in the process outputs occurs. The double EWMA
(dEWMA) controller was proposed. It was used to eliminate
this offset for a polysilicon gate etching process [5]. However,
controlled processes in the batch units frequently encountered
inherently more than one variable to be controlled. The control
of multivariable systems was not always an easy task because of
its complex and interactive nature. Based on a linear multiple
input and multiple output model, a multivariate EWMA
controller was proposed [6]. A multivariable extension of the
dEWMA controller was presented to analyze the robustness and
stability conditions [7]. However, the controlled system would

VI. SIMULATION STUDY
This example is intended to show how the proposed control
techniques can be used to design an iterative learning batch
controller for a typical exothermic chemical batch reactor. The
differential equations and the simulation condition describing
the reaction process are given by [8]. The reaction system
involves two consecutive first-order reactions, CBA  .
Two stages are run in the system. In the first (start-up) stage, the
steam in the jacket initially heats up the reactor content until the
exothermic heat of reaction is generated significantly enough. In
the second (maintenance) stage, the cooling water in the jacket
is used to remove the exothermic heats of reaction. The control
structure of the system consists of two levels. In the lower level,
the reactor temperature is controlled by two split-ranged control
valves, a steam valve and a water valve. The higher level of
control is needed to assure the quality of the product of interest
at the end of each batch run. Because of the lack of in-situ
measurements of the product qualities, the products must be
moved from the reactor to a laboratory before an accurate
measurement of the control concentration can be taken.
Alternatively, other more easily measurable variables, such as
the reactor temperature, may be used as an indicator for the
compositions of the product. fx (initial concentration of AC )
and mx (the jacket and the reactor temperatures) are collected
during each batch run. cx is the designed temperature of the
reactor to be computed from the design controller for the
desired qualities at the end of the batch run. The control
objective is to maintain the concentrations of A and B at their
desired levels after the batch run is finished. ( )fty consists of
two measured quality variables, concentrations of AC and BC ,
at the end of each batch run ( ft ).
The duration of each batch is 150 minutes. The sampling time
of each batch is 15 minutes ( 10K ). Two quality variables in
y are measured at the end of each batch run. The process is
affected by a persistent disturbance ( )0.1,0( 2NID ) in the two
control valves of nominal upstream pressures. The process
measured jacket and the reactor temperatures with noise
( )1.0,0( 2NID ) are included. Also, the initial concentration AC
with noise ( )003.0,0( 2NID ) is introduced. A total of 50 batches
based on the normal operation whose design quality is set to be
3344.0 ftlbmolCA  and 3426.0 ftlbmolCB  is used as the
basis analysis. The MPLS model is built upon the based case
operation data whose designed quality is around the normal
condition. Another 20 runs which do not come from the training
sets are produced in a similar way for cross validation. The
percentage of variance captured by each PLS component is
listed in Table I. The MPLS model with two principal
components captures over 95.3% of the variance in the
relationships of the system. To investigate the performance of
the proposed method, two cases, including disturbance changes
within a batch run, and disturbance changes occurring at
batch-to-batch, are tested respectively.

(gHMT) is developed. It characterizes the process
measurements by the growing and learning procedure. The
rest of the paper is organized as follows. Conventional MPCA
is briefly reviewed in Sections II. In Section III, the
construction of HMT is looked over from the viewpoint of
scale-by-scale successive modeling. The formulation of how
to select the nodes for the construction of gHMT is presented.
Section IV discusses how to build up the confidence limit
based on the gHMT model to monitor batch processes. In
Section V, the performance of the proposed method is
investigated through a set of benchmark data and a
comparison with the conventional MPCA is made. Finally, a
summary and some conclusions are presented.

II. MPCA
MPCA, based on PCA, is used for analysis of batch process
data. The experimental data can be constructed in the form of
the three-dimensional array, as shown in Fig. 1. A
three-dimensional array of data matrix X with KJI 
summarizes a series of runs of a typical batch process, where
Jj ,,2,1  variables are measured at times Kk ,,2,1 
intervals throughout one batch. Similar data will be run at
several numbers of batches Ii ,,2,1  . In MPCA, there are
two main data structures to represent two-way matrices
(shown in Fig. 1) in order to perform the ordinary PCA. This
means that the three-dimensional array (measurements,
batches and time) must be unfolded into a large
two-dimensional matrix. After mean-centering and scaling
the unfolded data matrix, PCA is applied to decomposing
array X into the summation of the product of score vectors t
and loading matrices p ,

where r is the number of principal components, E is a
residual matrix, T expresses the a score matrix and P is a
loading matrix. Several examples have been used to analyze
batch data and detail the procedures for monitoring batch
processes [1]. In (1), the process data matrix X is
represented by the explained variation of the quality
characteristic TTP plus the unexplained variation
)}({ keE , often called the random measurement error
resulted from the uncertain variations and disturbances
among the lurking variables. The assumptions of the normal
distribution of the unexplained part on process modeling can
mislead conclusions in the analysis of data when the process
variables are non-Gaussian distribution. As expected, the
performance of the MPCA model would be deteriorated as
the batch profiles exhibit serial correlation. Besides, the
MPCA-based monitoring method only focuses on the process
variable relationship in the time domain rather than in the
frequency domain. In this paper, HMT models are applied to
extract the process information in the time-frequency domain
and to further improve the performance of the conventional
MPCA model.

III. GROWING HIDDEN MARKOV TREE
HMT [5] is one of probabilistic models with a set of the
hierarchy tree structure (Fig. 2). It is a dual stochastic process
with an underlying stochastic process that is not observable (it
is hidden), but it can only be observed through another set of
the stochastic process that produces the sequence of the
observed wavelet coefficients. Assume that a set of data
  Kkkk RRtyt 0)(  is obtained from the sampling data of
an operating process. kt describes the sampling point and
)( kty describes the corresponding operating condition at kt .
The measured signal of length K is first decomposed by the
discrete wavelet transform (DWT) that represents the signal
with both time and frequency characteristics, as shown in
Fig.2, where there are jj KK 2 coefficients in the j th
scale. ijw , denotes the i th wavelet coefficient at the j th
scale, its parent is 1]2)1([,1  ijw with the operation ]2)1([ i
taking integer part of 2)1( i and its two children are
12,1  ijw and ijw 2,1 . HMT is a model that captures the
underlying dependencies among the wavelet coefficients
across different scales. Each wavelet coefficient (or node) has
a hidden backbone that contains a finite number of states. The
state in a node is only dependent on its immediate parent and

to get the accuracy. Based on the newly selected local
wavelets, the gHMT would be updated after the new

finding the new node locations at the next finer scale ( 2j )

satisfies the defined accuracy is found. In the above
procedures, the parameters of HMT can be roughly
characterized. The rough model can be refined to be even

IV. GHMT FOR BATCH TRONITORING
A. gHMT-Based MPCA Model
The data matrix X ( KJI  ) is unfolded to the
two-dimensional matrix ( JKI ) with structure II. PCA is
performed on X to decompose the process variables into a
new set of the loading variables in the lower dimensional
space. The purpose of this step is to eliminate the interactions
between process variables in the latent space. The score
matrix is

Then gHMT further carries out the scores of process variation.
Unlike single tree of gHMT, each direction in the reduced
space contains the scores for all simultaneous batch runs. This
will avoid over-fitting of the gHMT model and achieve the
