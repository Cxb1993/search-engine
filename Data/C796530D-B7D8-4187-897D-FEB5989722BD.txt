constraint. The distance constraint is described as 
follows: given any two vertices x and y and any 
length L with dCQn(x,y) <= L <= 2^(n-1) and L <> 
dCQn(x,y) + 1, embed a Hamiltonian cycle C such that 
dC(x,y) = L.

1. Introduction 
     In many parallel and distributed computer systems, processors are connected based on 
interconnection networks, so the interconnection network is a critical factor that affects system 
performance and it is widely addressed by researchers [14, 20, 26]. In terms of network analysis, the 
topological structure of an interconnection network can be modeled as a graph whose vertices and 
edges represent processors and communication links, respectively. Among many kinds of network 
topologies, the binary n-cube [23] (for short, hypercube) is one of the most popular networks for 
parallel and distributed computation. Not only is it ideally suited to both special-purpose and 
general-purpose tasks, but it can efficiently simulate many other networks [14, 20, 26]. However, 
the hypercube is bipartite so that it cannot make the best use of its hardware resources. For example, 
the hypercube has the largest diameter among cube family. To compensate for this drawback, many 
researchers [1, 7, 8, 28] try to fashion networks with lower diameters. One such network topology is 
the crossed cube, which was first proposed by Efe [9]. The crossed cube is derived from the 
hypercube by changing the connection of some links. Its diameter is about half of the hypercube’s 
[6, 9]. Besides, the crossed cube has many attractive properties. For example, it has more cycles 
than the hypercube [12], and binary trees can be embedded into it [18]. Moreover, the embedding of 
paths of odd and even lengths [11, 13] and the embedding of many-to-many disjoint path covers [22] 
can be done in the crossed cube. 
     Throughout this study, graphs are finite, simple, and undirected. Some important 
graph-theoretic definitions and notations will be introduced in advance. For those not defined here, 
however, they can be followed the standard terminology given by Bondy and Murty [4]. An 
undirected graph G is a graph with vertex set V(G) and edge set E(G), where |V(G)| > 0 and E(G)  
{(u, v)|(u, v) is an unordered pair of V(G)}. Two vertices u and v of G are adjacent if (u, v)  E(G). 
The degree of a vertex u in G is the number of edges incident to u. A graph G is k-regular if all its 
vertices have the same degree k. A graph H is a subgraph of G if V(H)  V(G) and E(H)  E(G); H 
is a spanning subgraph of G (equivalently, H spans G) if V(H) = V(G). Let S be a nonempty subset 
of V(G). The subgraph of G induced by S is a graph whose vertex set is S and whose edge set 
consists of all the edges of G joining any two vertices in S. 
     A path P of length k, k  1, from vertex x to vertex y in G is a sequence of distinct vertices v1, 
v2, …, vk+1 such that v1 = x, vk+1 = y, and (vi, vi+1)  E(G) for every 1  i  k. Moreover, a path of 
length 0, consisting of a single vertex x, is denoted by x. P can be written as v1, v2, …, vi , Q, 
vj, …, vk+1 for convenience if Q = vi, …, vj where i  j. The ith vertex of P is denoted by P(i); i.e., 
P(i) = vi . In particular, let rev(P) represent the reverse of P; that is, rev(P) = vk+1, vk, …, v1. The 
length of P can be denoted by l(P). The distance between two distinct vertices u and v in G, denoted 
by dG(u, v), is the length of the shortest path between u and v. A cycle is a path with at least three 
vertices such that the last vertex is adjacent to the ﬁrst one. For clarity, a cycle of length k, k  3, is 
represented by v1, v2, …, vk, v1. A path (or cycle) is a Hamiltonian path (or Hamiltonian cycle) of 
G if it spans G. A graph G is Hamiltonian if it has a Hamiltonian cycle, and a graph G is 
Hamiltonian connected if it contains a Hamiltonian path joining any pair of distinct vertices. 
     In recent years, many research results about cycle embedding have been focused on exploring 
4 
 
  In [9], Efe proposed a shortest path routing algorithm Route(u, v) for CQn, which implies the 
following two lemmas. 
Lemma 1 [9]. Let u and v be any different vertices of CQn such that {u, v}  V(CQ
i 
n–1) , i{0,1}. 
Then, dCQn(u, v) = dCQ
i 
n–1
(u, v). 
Lemma 2 [9]. Let u and v be any vertices of CQn, n  2, such that u is in CQ
0 
n–1 and v is in CQ
1 
n–1. 
Suppose that x is the vertex in CQ
1 
n–1 adjacent to u, and y is the vertex in CQ
0 
n–1 adjacent to v. Then, 
dCQn(u, v) = dCQn(u, y) +1 or dCQn(u, v) = dCQn(x, v) +1. 
     Fan et al. [13] proved that, for any two vertices u and v in CQn, there exists a path of length l 
joining u and v for any integer l with dCQn(u, v)  l  2
n
 – 1 and l  dCQn(u, v) + 1. 
     A Hamiltonian graph G is said to be f-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian if G – F remains 
Hamiltonian for every F  V(G)  E(G) with |F|  f.  A Hamiltonian connected graph G is said to 
be f-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian connected if G – F remains Hamiltonian connected for every F  
V(G)  E(G) with |F|  f. 
Lemma 3 [15]. For any integer n, n  3, CQn is (n–2)-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian and 
(n–3)-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian connected. 
     Any vertex u = unun–1un–2…u1 in CQn is said to be adjacent to a vertex v = vnvn–1vn–2…v1 along 
the ith dimension, 1  i  n, if the following four conditions are all satisfied: (i) ui  vi, (ii) uj = vj for 
all j, i+1  j  n, (iii) u2k u2k–1 ~ v2kv2k–1 for all k, 1  k  (i–1)/2, and (iv) ui–1 = vi–1 if i is even. 
Then, u is the i-neighbor of v, denoted by (v)
i
, and vice versa. The edge (u,(u)
i
) is called an 
i-dimensional edge. It is easy to see that v = (u)
i
 if and only if u = (v)
i
. 
Lemma 4. Let u be any vertex of CQn, n  3. For any integer i, 1  i  n – 1, ((u)
i
)
n
 = ((u)
n
)
i
 if (1) i 
is even, or (2) i = n – 1 with n even. 
Proof. Let u, v, x, y, and z be five vertices of CQn, where v = (u)
n
, x = (u)
i
, y = (v)
i
, and z = (x)
n
. 
Since CQn = CQ
0 
n–1   CQ
1 
n–1, we assume, without loss of generality, that u  V(CQ
0 
n–1). According 
to the possible values of n and i, we distinguish the following three cases. 
Case 1.  n is even and i = 2j for any j; 1  j  (n–1)/2. By the definition of i-neighbors, we can 
obtain immediately that yp = zp for 1  p  n except p  {i, i – 1}. Moreover, zizi–1 ~ iu ui–1, yiyi–1 
= iv vi–1, and vivi–1 ~ uiui–1, where iu  denotes the complement of ui. According to the possible values 
of ui–1, we consider the following two subcases. 
Subcase 1.1. ui–1 = 0. This results in zizi–1 = iu 0, vivi–1 = ui0, and yiyi–1 = iv vi–1 = iu 0. It yields y = 
z. 
Subcase 1.2. ui–1 = 1. This results in zizi–1 ~ ui1, vivi–1 = iu 1, and yiyi–1 = iv vi–1 = ui1. This also 
yields y = z. Thus, ((u)
i
)
n
 = ((u)
n
)
i
 when n is even and i = 2j for any j; 1  j  (n–1)/2. 
Case 2. n is even and i = n – 1. In this case, by the definition of i-neighbors, we can derive directly 
that yp = zp for 1  p  n–2. Furthermore, ynyn–1 = vn 1nv  = nu 1nu  and znzn–1 = nx xn–1 = 
nu 1nu . This reveals that y = z. 
Case 3. n is odd. By a similar argument as that in Case 1, this case holds. This concludes the proof

y, R2, z, (z)
n
, S, a is a Hamiltonian path of CQn with P(1) = x and P(l+1) = y. 
Subcase 1.2. l = 2
n–1
. Let a be any vertex in CQ
1 
n–1 other than (x)
n
 and (y)
n
. By Lemma 3, there 
exists a Hamiltonian path S of CQ
1 
n–1 – {a} joining (x)
n
 to (y)
n.
 Similarly, there exists a Hamiltonian 
path R of CQ
0 
n–1 – {x} joining (a)
n
 and y. Then, P = x, (x)n, S, (y)n, y, R, (a)n, a is a Hamiltonian 
path of CQn such that P(1) = x and P(2
n–1
+1) = y. 
Subcase 1.3. 2
n–1
 + 1  l  2n – 1. By Lemma 3, there exists a Hamiltonian path R of CQ0 n–1 joining 
x to y. For clarity, path R is written as x, R1, a, b, R2, y, where a and b are adjacent vertices 
satisfying l(R1) = l – 2
n–1
 – 1. It is noticed that x = a if l = 2n–1 + 1, and b = y if l = 2n – 1. Again, 
Lemma 3 ensures that CQ
1 
n–1 has a Hamiltonian path S joining (a)
n
 to (y)
n
. Then, P = x, R1, a, (a)
n
, 
S, (y)
n
, y, rev(R2), b is a Hamiltonian path of CQn such that P(1) = x and P(l+1) = y. 
Case 2. y  V(CQ
1 
n–1) and (x, y)  E(CQn). The following three subcases are distinguished. 
Subcase 2.1. dCQn(x, y)  l  2
n–1
 – 1 and l  dCQn(x, y) + 1.  By Lemmas 1 and 2, dCQ
0 
n–1
(x, (y)
n
) = 
dCQn(x, (y)
n
) = dCQn(x, y) – 1 or dCQ
1 
n–1
((x)
n
, y) = dCQn((x)
n
, y) = dCQn(x, y) – 1.  Firstly, assume that 
dCQ
0 
n–1
(x, (y)
n
) = dCQn(x, y) – 1.  By the inductive hypothesis, there exists a Hamiltonian path R of 
CQ
0 
n–1 with R(1) = x and R(l) = (y)
n
. For clarity, path R is written as x, R1, (y)
n
, a, R2, z, where a 
and z are vertices in V(CQ
0 
n–1) – {x, (y)
n
}. It is noticed that a = z if l = 2
n–1
 – 1. By Lemma 3, there 
exists a Hamiltonian path S of CQ
1 
n–1 joining y to (z)
n
. Then, P = x, R1, (y)
n
, y, S, (z)
n
, z, rev(R2), a 
is a Hamiltonian path of CQn such that P(1) = x and P(l+1) = y. 
     Next, assume that dCQ
1 
n–1
((x)
n
, y) = dCQn(x, y) – 1. By the inductive hypothesis, there exists a 
Hamiltonian path S of CQ
1 
n–1 with S(1) = (x)
n
 and S(l) = y. The path S can be written as (x)n, S1, y, 
S2, z, where z is some vertex in V(CQ
1 
n–1) – {(x)
n
, y}. By Lemma 3, there exists a Hamiltonian path 
R of CQ
0 
n–1 – {x} joining (z)
n
 to any vertex a in V(CQ
0 
n–1) – {x, (z)
n
}. Then, P = x, (x)n, S1, y, S2, z, 
(z)
n
, R, a is a Hamiltonian path of CQn such that P(1) = x and P(l+1) = y. 
Subcase 2.2. 2
n–1
  l  2n – 2. Let h = l – 2n–1. By Lemma 3, CQ0 n–1 has a Hamiltonian path R joining 
x and (y)
n
. For convenience, path R is written as x, R1, a, b, R2, (y)
n, where a and b are two 
adjacent vertices in CQ
0 
n–1 with l(R1) = h. It is noticed that a = x if l = 2
n–1
 and b = (y)
n
 if l = 2
n
 – 2. 
Obviously, CQ
1 
n–1 has a Hamiltonian path S joining (a)
n
 to y. Then, P = x, R1, a, (a)
n
, S, y, (y)
n
, 
rev(R2), b is a Hamiltonian path of CQn with P(1) = x and P(l+1) = y. 
Subcase 2.3. l = 2
n
 – 1. By Lemma 3, CQn is Hamiltonian connected. Thus, there exists a 
Hamiltonian path P of CQn joining x to y. 
Case 3. y  V(CQ1 n–1) and (x, y)  E(CQn). Since (x, y)  E(CQn), it can be obtained that 1  l  2
n
 – 
1 and l  2. When l = 1, it follows from Lemma 3 that there exists a Hamiltonian path R of CQn – {x} 
joining y to any vertex z, z  x, so that P = x, y, R, z is the required path with P(1) = x and P(2) = 
y. Thus, it is necessary to discuss only 3  l  2n – 1. The following subcases are distinguished. 
Subcase 3.1. l = 3. By Corollary 1, the set of vertices {x, y, (x)
2
, (y)
2
} induces a cycle of length 4. 
By Lemma 3, CQn is (n–3)-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian connected. Therefore, there exists a 
Hamiltonian path R of CQn – {(x)
2
, (y)
2
} joining y to x. R can be written as y, R, z, x, where z is 
some vertex in V(CQn) – {x, y, (x)
2
, (y)
2
}. Then, P = x, (x)2, (y)2, y, R, z is a Hamiltonian path of 
CQn such that P(1) = x and P(4) = y. 
Subcase 3.2. l = 4. By Lemma 5, the set of vertices {x, y, (x)
1
, (y)
1
, ((y)
1
)
2
} induces a cycle of 
8 
 
joining (x)
i
 and y. Similarly, CQ
1 
n–1 – {a, (a)
i
} has a Hamiltonian path S joining (y)
n
 and (b)
n
. Then, 
C = x, a, (a)i, (x)i, R, y, (y)n, S, (b)n, b, x is a Hamiltonian cycle of CQn with dC(x, y) =2
n–1
. 
Case 2. y  V(CQ1 n–1) and (x, y)  E(CQn).  By Lemmas 1 and 2, dCQ
0 
n–1
(x, (y)
n
) = dCQn(x, y) – 1 or 
dCQ

((x)
n
, y) = dCQn(x, y) – 1. For convenience, let h = l – 1. 
     Suppose that dCQ

(x, (y)
n
) = dCQn(x, y) – 1. Since dCQ

n
)  h  2n–1 – 1 and h  dCQ
0 
n–1
(x,

n
) + 1. Theorem 1 ensures that there exists a Hamiltonian path R of CQ
0 
n–1 with R(1) = (y)
n
 and 
R(h+1) = x. For convenience, path R is written as (y)n, R1, x, R2, z, where z is some vertex in 
V(CQ
0 
n–1) – {(y)
n
}. It is noticed that z = x if h = 2
n–1
 – 1. By Lemma 3, there exists a Hamiltonian 
path S of CQ
1 
n–1 joining y to (z)
n
. Then, C = x, rev(R1), (y)
n
, y, S, (z)
n
, z, rev(R2), x is a Hamiltonian 
cycle of CQn such that dC(x, y) = h + 1 = l. 
     Suppose that dCQ

((x)

1 
n–1with S(1) = (x)

 and S(h+1) = 
y. Path S can be written as (x)n, S1, y, S2, z, where z is some vertex in V(CQ
1 
n–1) – {(x)
n
}. It is 
noticed that z = y if h = 2
n–1
 – 1. By Lemma 3, there exists a Hamiltonian path R of CQ0 n–1 joining 
(z)
n
 to x. Then, C = x, (x)n, S1, y, S2, z, (z)
n
, R, x is a Hamiltonian cycle of CQn such that dC(x, y) = 
h + 1 = l. 
Case 3. y  V(CQ1 n–1) and (x, y)  E(CQn). Since (x, y)  E(CQn), it can be obtained that 1  l  2
n–1
 
and l  2. When l = 1, it follows from Lemma 3 that there exists a Hamiltonian path R of CQn 
joining y to x, and C = x, y, R, x is the required cycle with dC(x, y) = 1. Therefore, it is necessary 
to discuss only 3  l  2n–1. The following three subcases are distinguished. 
Subcase 3.1. l = 3. As described in the proof of Subcase 3.1 of Theorem 1, there exists a 
Hamiltonian cycle C = x, (x)2, (y)2, y, R, z, x of CQn with dC(x, y) = 3. 
Subcase 3.2. l = 4. By using the same argument as that in Subcase 3.2 of Theorem 1, there exists a 
Hamiltonian cycle C = x, (x)1, ((y)1)2, (y)1, y, S, v, (v)n, R , u, x of CQn with dC(x, y) = 4. 
Subcase 3.3. 5  l  2n–1. This subcase is the same as Subcase 3.3 of Theorem 1, and C = x, rev(R1), 
(x)
2
, (y)

, y, S, (z)
n
, z, rev(R2), v, x is a Hamiltonian cycle of CQn with dC(x, y) = l.        
 
4. Concluding remarks 
     The class of crossed cubes is a popular variant of the hypercube network. However, the 
crossed cube is not panpositionably Hamiltonian due to the limitation that it contains no cycle of 
length 3 as a subgraph. Therefore, it is attracted to propose a relaxed version of panpositionable 
Hamiltonicity for the crossed cube. This study investigates the problem of embedding a 
Hamiltonian cycle in the crossed cube such that two required vertices can keep a given distance 
from each other. To be precise, let x and y be any two distinct vertices of CQn. This study shows 
that, for any integer l with dCQn(x, y)  l  2
n–1
 and l  dCQn(x, y) + 1, there exists a Hamiltonian 
cycle C of CQn such that dC(x, y) = l.

happen when a network is used. In this paper, we investigate fault-tolerant 
Hamiltonian connectedness of a crossed cube which has path faults.  More 
precisely, let F denote any path of length l in an n-dimensional crossed cube CQn for 
n  5.  We show that CQn – V(F) is Hamiltonian connected if l  n – 2; i.e. |V(F)|  
n – 1.  This result improves the previous result of tolerating arbitrary n – 3 faulty 
vertices in a crossed cube.  Our result also implies that the crossed cube can 
tolerate much more faulty vertices if they happen to form some specific types of 
structures.
