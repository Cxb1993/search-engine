摘要
由癌症手術切除(如乳癌)或是嚴重燒傷所造成軟組織受損，需要進行脂肪組織重
建，來回復原有功能與外觀，目前常用的自體脂肪移植的方法，有 40~60%的體
積會消失，造成移植部位的塌陷。由於間葉系幹細胞具有自我更新與分化成脂肪
細胞，血管細胞的能力，非常適合脂肪組織的重建，所以使用間葉系幹細胞有機
會可以解決上述脂肪組織塌陷的問題。目前間葉系幹細胞之培養與誘導過程，多
是在有 10%血清添加的環境進行，由於藥物管理單位對於用於細胞治療之細胞，
要求細胞培養的過程中不可使用血清，甚至是人或動物來源的成分，以降低人畜
共通傳染之風險。本計劃第一年度完成對間葉系幹細胞，建立無血清培養技術與
脂肪組織的分化誘導技術，第二年度完成自行製備生物分解性多孔性微載體，配
合第一年所開發出的培養基、誘導分化程序，討論多孔性微載體之性質與懸浮培
養條件對間葉系幹細胞的增生潛力之影響。

Abstract
This project aims to develop the biodegradable microcarriers and to expand the MSCs
ex vivo. We screened several growth factors in order to develop the serum-free media
for mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Among the tested factors, basic-FGF, insulin,
transferrrin, selenium, lipumin (commercial supplement ) could enhance the
proliferation of MSC. The concentration and composition of serum-free medium
(SFM) were optimized for the proliferation. The SFM was used to differentiate the
MSC into adipocytes, chondrocytes, and osteocytes with the help of chemical inducers.
The preliminary results demonstrated that the SFM developed could be used for the
proliferation and differentiation of MSC. Sequentially, gelatin microcarriers were
synthesized for suspended MSC culture to fulfill the purpose of regeneration medicine
of MSC. The membrane emulsification was used to produce the gelatin microspheres
which have the biodegradable and injectable characteristics. The optimal size of
microspheres for cell culture was in the range of 100-150 micometer. We optimized
the revolution rate and gelatin concentration to obtain the desired microcarriers with
the swelling ratio of 2. The gelatin microspheres were crosslinked to enhance the
strength of microbeads by using the genipin from plants. At the same time, several
strategies for surface modification were discussed including cationic peptide
(Poly-L-Lysine) modification and signal peptide (Arg-Gly-Asp) modification. The cell
attachment and proliferation efficiency were evaluated. Our preliminary results
indicated that the microcarriers developed in this study had the similar proliferation

Gelatin microspheres produced by membrane emulsification
Membrane emulsification is a new technique for the production of uniform particulates over
the last 15 years. The advantages of this technique include the low energy consumption, the
better control of droplet size and droplet size distribution and the mildness of the process.
Droplets size produced by membrane emulsification is determined by the balance between the
forces acting on the droplet. The main forces are the drag force, the interfacial tension force,
and the Laplace pressure between the dispersed phase in the pore and in the droplet that is
being formed. How to precisely control the size of microspheres is an important issue for
different applications. In this study membrane emulsification is adapted to produce
microspheres from the native gelatin protein. The factors studied in this report include gelatin
type and concentration, membrane type, and different oils. From our results, the size and
distribution of gelatin microspheres can be controlled by manipulating the production process.
The technique developed can be applied as a drug delivery carrier and tissue engineering
matrixes for the constituent of skin, bones, and connective tissues.
A series of experiments are performed to investigate the effects of gelatin type and
concentration, membrane type, and different oils. Membranes with different hydrophobicity
were ued to produce gelatin microspheres. The size of gelatin microspheres produced by
hydrophobic PP membrane is smaller than that by hydrophilic PC membrane (Fig 7). In
addition, gelatin type and concentration did not significantly influence on the size of gelatin
microspheres under the agitation rate of 700 rpm. However, when the rate decreased from 700
to 500 rpm, the size increased as the gelatin concentration increased (Fig 8). In order to
strengthen gelatin microspheres, a zero length crosslinker
1-Ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide(EDC) was used to crosslink the protein.

Gelatin microspheres optimization
Aim: One of major objectives is to develop the microcarriers for mesenchymal stem
cells cultivation. First, the process for microcarrier production was optimized by using
the factorial design. The important parameters discussed in this study include
revolution rate (rpm) and gelatin concentration. The code and concentration used in
the Composite Design was shown in Table 1. Regression of Statistics Analysis
System(SAS) software was used to demonstrate the effects of gelatin concentration
(X1) and agitation rate (X2)on bead size (Fig 11). The obtained equation is listed

Surface modification of gelatin microspheres
Several strategies for surface modification were discussed including cationic peptide
(Poly-L-Lysine) modification and signal peptide (Arg-Gly-Asp) modification.
The cell attachment and proliferation efficiency were evaluated. The morphology of
gelatin microcarriers was shown in Fig 12 by using SEM. The topology of microbeads
without crosslinkage was very smooth as compared with that with crosslinkage.
(b)after genipin. The size of microsphere was in the range of 100-150 micrometer. The
rough surface might be suitable for cell attachment for the increase of extracellular
matrix (ECM).

Fig 13 demonstrated the cell proliferation on the surface modified by Poly-L-Lysine

comparative results of self-made and commercial products were shown in Fig 14. PLL
coating microcarriers could support a better growth for MSC as compared with that of
24 well culture plate. Cytodex C3 can support better cell growth than those on
Cytodex C1 and PLL-microcarriers. Finally, Fig 15 indicated that the proliferation of
MSC on PLL coating microcarriers was fibroblast-type as that on 2D-plate.

Conclusion
This project succeeded to develop the biodegradable microcarriers and to expand the
MSCs ex vivo. We found several growth factors in order to develop the serum-free
media for mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Among the tested factors, basic-FGF,
insulin, transferrrin, selenium, lipumin (commercial supplement ) could enhance the
proliferation of MSC. The concentration and composition of serum-free medium
(SFM) were optimized for the proliferation. The SFM was used to differentiate the
MSC into adipocytes, chondrocytes, and osteocytes with the help of chemical inducers.
The preliminary results demonstrated that the SFM developed could be used for the
proliferation and differentiation of MSC. Sequentially, gelatin microcarriers were
synthesized for suspended MSC culture to fulfill the purpose of regeneration medicine
of MSC. The membrane emulsification was used to produce the gelatin microspheres
which have the biodegradable and injectable characteristics. The gelatin microspheres
were crosslinked to enhance the strength of microbeads by using the genipin from
plants. At the same time, several strategies for surface modification were discussed
including cationic peptide (Poly-L-Lysine) modification and signal peptide
(Arg-Gly-Asp) modification. The cell attachment and proliferation efficiency were
evaluated. Our results indicated that the microcarriers developed in this study had the
similar proliferation performance as the commercial product (Cytodex 1). In sum, our
study demonstrated the potential of biodegradable microcarriers applied for stem cell
proliferation and regeneration therapeutics.
