ABSTRACT 
Polymorphism and its influential factors in poly(heptamethylene terephthalate) (PHepT) were 
probed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) 
spectroscopy, and wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). PHepT exhibits two crystal types (α and β) 
upon crystallization at various isothermal melt-crystallization temperatures (Tc) by quenching from 
different Tmax (maximum temperature above Tm for melting the original crystals). Melt-crystallized 
PHepT with either initial α- or β-crystal by quenching from Tmax lower than 110oC leads to higher 
fractions of α-crystal, but crystallization from Tmax higher than 140oC leads to higher fractions of 
β-crystal. In addition to Tmax, polymorphism in PHepT is also influenced by crystallization 
temperature (Tc=25~75oC). When PHepT is melt-crystallized from a high Tmax=150oC (completely 
isotropic melt), it shows solely β crystal for higher Tc, and solely the α-crystal for Tc < 25oC; in 
between Tc=25 and 35oC, mixed fractions of both α- and β-crystals. However, by contrast, when 
PHepT is melt-crystallized from a lower Tmax=110oC, it shows α-crystal only at all Tc’s, high or 
low. 
    Spherulite morphology and growth kinetics of poly(octamethylene terephthalate) (POT), cast 
on single-side glass or confined between two slides in thin-film forms, were characterized using 
polarized vs. non-polarized optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and 
wide-angle X-ray (WAXD) analysis.  POT can simultaneously display solely one type of 
spherulite or dual types of spherulites (double-ring banded and ringless ones), depending on Tc or 
Tmax imposed.  Fractions of these two types depend on Tc when quenched from a fixed Tmax=160oC.  
At lower Tc’s, POT exhibits higher crystallization rates leading to higher fractions of ring-less 
spherulites; at higher Tc’s, POT exhibits lower crystallization rates leading to ring-banded 
spherulites.  At intermediate to high Tc’s where the growth kinetic of POT could be monitored, the 
ring-band type dominates and the fraction of ringless spherulites is insignificantly small.  Both 
ringless and ring-banded spherulites can be seen in Regime-III (Tc=70~110oC), with fractions of 
ringless type of spherulites decreasing with temperature.  Thus, growth kinetics for POT was 
mainly focused on the regime of ring-banded spherulites.  In regime-III, the ring band pattern is 
more orderly concentric with smaller inter-ring spacing (1~2 µm) for lower Tc’s but intermediately 
larger spacing (3~5 µm) for higher Tc’s.  The orderly lamellar orientation in the ring bands in 
contrast with the inter-ring valley region is discussed.  In Regime-II (115oC and above), the 
ring-band pattern is first distorted to highly zigzag irregularity higher at Tc’s and then eventually 
disappears at extremely high Tc, with the lamellar crystals eventually turning dendritic with no rings.  
Apparently, the types of spherulites in polymers are more influenced by the growth rates as 
determined by Tc and slightly less by Tmax, but not by the substrate surface nucleation.

clusters of molecules that retain their crystallographic arrangement of crystals as a result of 
insufficient melting condition [41]. Memory effect on the polymorphism has also been reported for 
aliphatic polyesters, such as poly(1,4-butylene adipate) (PBA) [42].  PBA shows two crystal forms 
(labeled as α- and β-) depending on the crystallization temperature. When the crystallization 
temperature is higher than 31oC, only sole α-form is obtained; when the crystallization temperature 
is lower than 28oC, only the β-crystal is obtained [5-7]. However, if the originally α-crystal 
(melt-crystallized at 35oC) is heated to 52oC, a temperature not high enough to erase all the α-nuclei, 
and re-crystallized at 28oC, then the α-crystal is again produced [42]. 
Ring-bands and mechanisms of their formation have been widely discussed in the literature 
[43-53]. Interpretation is that rings may be attributed to cooperative twisting of the lamellae along 
the direction of radial growth; however, relevant mechanisms and relationships between lamellar 
twisting and rings are still controversial.  Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and poly(butylene 
terephthalate) (PBT), have been studied extensively on their thermal behavior, mechanical 
properties, and crystal structures [54-58]. Recently, poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT) has also 
attracted much attention owing to its excellent mechanical properties [59]. More recently, we have 
observed interesting ringed patterns in poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT) melt-crystallized at 
temperature ranging from 150 to 215°C [60]. Ring-bands in spherulites have been reported in PTT 
or its miscible blends, where the stacked lamellae assume a flat-on and an edge-on orientation in the 
dark and bright regions, respectively, leading to formation of a ringed morphology [60,61]. On the 
other hand, ring-banded spherulites have rarely been reported in PET or faster-crystallizing PBT, 
although it has been pointed out that some exceptions are seen in PET, where solution-cast PET can 
exhibit irregularly ordered ring bands. Melt-crystallized PET never displays ring bands in 
spherulites.  By contrast, ringed patterns are distinct in poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT) 
melt-crystallized at temperatures ranging from 150 to 215°C [61].  For ringless spherulites, 
phenomenon of regime transition can also be observed.  Lorenzo and Righetti [62] have also 
reported the crystallization regimes of poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT), which presents a 
transition of regime III to II. When crystallized at lower temperatures in regime III, the dominant 
morphology in PBT is unusual spherulites, but “mixed-type” crystals, with eight-arm crosses due to 
superposition of extinction patterns at 0 and 45o.  When crystallized at even higher temperatures, 
PBT displays a rough shape with less defined borders instead of regular spherulitic patterns.  
Transition between “mixed-type” spherulites and those without a defined extinction pattern in PBT 
occurs around 210~212oC, in correspondence to the regime III-II transition.  
Aryl polyesters with longer methylene groups, such as poly(pentamethylene terephthalate) 
(PPT), poly(hexamethylene terephthalate) (PHT), poly(heptamethylene terephthalate) (PHepT), etc., 
have been less studied owing to limited application interests.  For PPT, it is known that two 
distinct crystal forms (α and β) can co-exist in oriented forms; in particular, a structure 
transformation from α form to β form for PPT has also been found [63,64]. Both α and β forms in 
PPT are characterized by triclinic chain packing, differing only in the c-axis.  But typically only 
the α-crystal cell is seen in PPT crystallized/annealed under zero or small tensions.  The β-crystal

EXPERIMENTAL 
 
Materials and sample preparation 
    Poly(heptamethylene terephthalate) (PHepT) was not commercially available and was 
synthesized in-house using a catalyst (butyl titanate) by following the method described earlier in 
the literature [69].  Characterizations showed basic physical data for PHepT, whose Tg = -1.6oC, Tm 
= 96oC, and Mw = 37,500 g/mol (GPC). 
Poly(octamethylene terephthalate) (abbr.:POT), with 8 methylene units between terephthalate 
groups, is not commercially available; thus, it was synthesized in-house from a glycol monomer of 
(1,8-octanediol) and dimethyl terephthalate monomer using 0.1% butyl titanate as catalyst by 
two-step polymerization. The first step was a trans-esterification process, followed by 
polycondensation. The POT product was purified by re-precipitation and washing three times.  The 
molecular weight and polydispersity of POT determined by GPC (Waters) using polystyrene as a 
standard were 21,800 g/mol and 1.58, respectively.  POT in amorphous state, by rapid quenching 
from the melt, was used to obtain Tg = 3.2oC and Tm=132oC. 
 
Apparatus and procedures 
Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy.  FT-IR (Nicolet Magna-560) was used for 
identifying the associated crystal peak and to investigate the crystal form in PHepT. Spectra were 
obtained at 4cm-1 resolution and average was obtained at least 64 scans in the standard wavenumber 
range of 400~4000cm-1. Thin films for FT-IR studies were obtained by casting the PHepT solutions 
onto the potassium bromide (KBr) pellet at ambient temperature (25oC) and then solvent was 
removed in vacuum at 40oC. The thermal treatment of PHepT on KBr pellet was done on hot plate 
and hot stage whose temperatures are both calibrated by thermalcouples. When the IR 
characterization relating to the heating process of PHepT was performed, a microprocessor-driven 
temperature controller and a heated transmission cell (HT-32, Thermo Spectra-Tech) were equipped 
with the IR instrument. 
 
Thermal transition and crystallization rate. Tg transitions of the blend samples were measured 
with a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC-7, Perkin-Elmer) equipped with an intracooler (to 
-60oC) and data acquisition/analysis.  Additional sub-ambient DSC runs (temperature as low as 
-100oC) were cooled with a liquid nitrogen tank and helium gas purge.  Prior to DSC runs, the 
temperature and heat of transition of the instrument were calibrated with indium and zinc standards.  
During thermal annealing or scanning, a continuous nitrogen flow in the DSC sample cell was 
maintained to ensure minimal sample degradation. 
 
Morphology characterization  Polarized-light microscopy POM was used to investigate the 
spherulitic morphology of isothermally crystallized samples. Thin films for POM were obtained by 
casting from 2 wt% solution in CH2Cl2 on top side of glass slides at 45°C, with the top side 
 4
objective was to prepare POT samples for X-ray analysis in similar ways as the thin-film spherulites 
on glass slides for OM analysis.  The WAXD data revealing the crystal cell types in the POT 
samples were then used to correlate with the spherulite patterns via OM characterization.

melting peak of the β-crystal as Pβ2+Pβ3 is attributed to the following analysis. When scanned using 
the rate=1oC/min, the DSC trace shows a shoulder (Pβ2) accompanying the melting peak Pβ3, and 
with the increase in scanning rates, these two melting peaks merge into one peak (Pβ2+Pβ3) (DSC 
traces not shown for brevity).  By comparison, the melting peaks of Pα and Pβ are at nearly same 
temperature and so are the annealing peaks of both crystal forms (Pα,a and Pβ,a). However, the 
melting temperature of Pβ2+Pβ3 (β-crystal) is higher than that of Pα2 (α-crystal). When PHepT was 
melted at Tmax=130oC then isothermally crystallized PHepT at 55oC, it exhibits the melting peaks 
attributed to both the α- and the β-crystal for the coexistence of α- and β-crystal under this thermal 
treatment. However, for the similarity of Pα and Pβ in melting temperature, only three melting 
peaks (Pα+Pβ, Pα2, Pβ2+Pβ3) were obtained. The results obtained from DSC indicate that the 
polymorphism behavior of melt-crystallized PHepT is indeed influenced by Tmax.    
FT-IR is a powerful instrument in determining the conformation of molecules. In this study, it 
was used to analyze the characteristic absorption bands associated with the α- and β-crystal of 
melt-crystallized PHepT to provide supported evidence for the effect of Tmax on the polymorphism 
behavior of PHepT. Figure 3 shows time-dependent FT-IR spectra in the frequency range of 
750~1600 cm-1 for isothermal crystallization process from t=0 to 120min of PHepT 
melt-crystallized at 55oC quenching from Tmax=150oC showing β-crystal. During the crystallization 
process, the intensities of the absorption bands at 1470, 1468 and 950 cm-1 increase with the 
crystallization time for the formation of the β-crystal. Thus, these three bands were assigned as the 
characteristic absorption bands of β-crystal of PHepT.  Figure 4 shows the temperature-dependent 
FT-IR spectra in the frequency range of 750~1600 cm-1 on a real-time heating process from 55oC to 
120oC for PHepT, which was initially crystallized at 55oC on hot stage by quenching from 
Tmax=110oC with the sole α-crystal. In this case, the real-time heating process, instead of isothermal 
holding, was recorded and analyzed because the growth process of the α-crystal under this thermal 
treatment was too rapid to be analyzed by FTIR using an isothermal step-wise mode.  Upon 
heating from 55oC to 120oC, the absorption bands at 840, 954, 1005, 1308 and 1476cm-1 decrease in 
intensity with an increase of temperature because of the melting of the α-crystal. Thus, these bands 
were assigned as the characteristic absorption bands of α-crystal of PHepT. The difference in the 
characteristic absorption bands of PHepT samples melt-crystallized at 55oC, quenching from 
Tmax=150oC and 110oC respectively exhibiting β- and α-crystal, further manifests the influence of 
Tmax on the polymorphic behavior of PHepT.    
Effect of Tmax on the polymorphism behavior of a semicrystalline polymer is attributed to the 
memory effect of the residual nuclei when the temperature used to melt the original crystals is not 
high enough to erase all nuclei. In this study, all the starting materials of PHepT are of α-crystal. 
When Tmax is higher than 140oC, the α-crystal and α-nuclei can be erased completely, thus after 
quenching from isotropic melt (without nuclei) then crystallized at 55oC, the β-crystal is instead 
obtained. In contrast, when Tmax is low, the original α-crystal is partially erased, thus after 
quenching from melt containing α-nuclei then crystallized at 55oC, the α-crystal or mixed 　　 
crystal is obtained. Consequently, the polymorphic behavior of melt-crystallized PHepT is highly 
 8
The effect of the crystallization temperature on the polymorphism behavior of the 
melt-crystallized PHepT was also determined by FT-IR.  Figure 7 shows IR spectra of PHepT 
melt-crystallized at various temperatures (Tc=25~70oC) by quenching from a same Tmax=150oC. 
When Tc is higher than 35oC, only the absorption bands at 950cm-1 and 1470 cm-1 corresponding to 
the β-crystal of PHepT appear. Besides, there is no absorbance band associated with the α-crystal 
obtained when Tc is higher than 35oC. However, when crystallization temperature is lower than 
35oC (30 and 25oC), the absorption bands for the α-crystal appear.  From the insets in the figure, 
the bands at 840 and 1476 cm-1 corresponding to the α-crystal increase in intensity with a decrease 
of Tc from 35oC to 25oC, indicating the formation of higher fraction of the α-crystal at lower Tc. 
    Effect of crystallization temperatures on the polymorphism in melt-crystallized PHepT 
quenching from Tmax=110oC was also studied.  Figure 8 shows diffraction patterns of PHepT 
melt-crystallized at Tc=25~70oC with a same Tmax=110oC.  All X-ray diffractograms show only the 
diffraction peaks at 2θ=20.0, 22.0 and 24.3o, which are the characteristic diffraction peaks 
ofα-crystal, indicating that PHepT crystallized into α-crystal at all measured temperatures when 
quenched from Tmax=110oC.  In addition, thermal analysis characterization result should also be 
compared to the WAXD data.  Figure 9 shows the melting behavior of PHepT crystallized at the 
same range of temperature (Tc=25~70oC) by quenching from Tmax=110oC was also analyzed by 
DSC.  In each trace, only the melting peaks corresponding to α-crystal (Pα1, Pα2) were obtained, 
suggesting that upon melt crystallization at Tc=25~70oC by quenching from Tmax=110oC, PHepT 
exhibited only α-crystal.  With an increase of Tc, Pα1 shifts to higher temperature and increases in 
intensity for the formation of thicker lamellae upon crystallization at higher Tc (lower∆T).   
    Effect of the crystallization temperature on the polymorphism in melt-crystallized PHepT 
quenching from Tmax=110oC was also determined by FT-IR.  Figure 10 shows IR spectra of 
PHepT melt-crystallized at various temperatures (Tc=25~70oC) by quenching from Tmax=110oC.  
For PHePT crystallized at all Tc temperatures, the IR spectra show only the absorption bands 
associated with the α-crystal (at 840, 954, 1005, 1308 and 1476cm-1), and no absorption bands 
corresponding to the β-crystal are observed.  The IR result further demonstrates that the 
melt-crystallized PHepT by quenching from Tmax=110oC exhibits only the α-crystal at all measured 
temperatures (25~70oC). 
In addition to the effect of α-nuclei and crystallization temperature on the polymorphism of 
melt-crystallized PHepT, effect of β-nuclei was also investigated.  PHepT samples containing only 
the β-crystal were prepared by melt crystallization at 40oC for 2hr by quenching from a very high 
Tmax=150oC, at which all nuclei were completely erased.  When PHepT containing only the 
β-crystal was heated to Tmax=110oC (5min), the β-crystal could not be completely erased and thus 
the melt at Tmax=110oC would contain nuclei of β-form whose equilibrium melting temperature is 
slightly higher than 110oC.  The β-nuclei-containing melts were then crystallized at a wide range 
of Tc=25~55oC, and the crystallized PHepT samples were characterized using WAXD for evaluating 
their polymorphism states.  Figure 11 shows the WAXD diffractograms of PHepT 
melt-crystallized at Tc=25~55oC by quenching from Tmax=110oC.  This Tmax was regarded as a

using the classical Hoffman-Weeks method, and this value was used for subsequent calculation of 
regime behavior.

Kg can be estimated from the slopes of suitable plots. With the values of Kg determined, other 
parameters could be calculated. 
Figure 13 shows the corresponding Lauritzen-Hoffman plot according to Eq. (2), where data 
were obtained at temperature (Tc) of isothermal crystal growth varying from 106 to 126oC at 2~3oC 
step.  In this plot, apparently, growth patterns following Regime III and Regime II of different 
slopes are present.  The intersection of two straight lines corresponds to a discontinuity, which is 
near Ti=117.9oC.  This point agrees reasonably well with the intersection point shown in the 
previous figure.  Kg could be obtained from slopes of plots in this figure for regime III and II, 
respectively.  Physical constants for POT were needed for such plotting.  ΔHfo is the enthalpy of 
fusion per unit volume of a perfect and infinitely large crystal lamellae at its Tm.    For U*= 1500 
cal/mol, Kg(III)/ Kg(II) = 2.16 is resulted, which turns out to be the closest to the theoretical value of 
2.0 according to the predictive requirement of Kg(III) = 2 Kg(II).  Temperature at the discontinuity 
(i.e., transition from Regime-II to -III) is 118.4oC (TII→III).  
 
Correlation Between Growth Regime and Spherulite Patterns 
   There is a systematic change in spherulite patterns as the temperature changes in ascending 
schemes, in which the growth transits from Regime-III to II.  Figure 13 along with inset OM 
graphs shows the various spherulite patterns corresponding to Regime III and II, respectively.  
Clear and regular ring-bands with good order are apparent in Regime-III, from 106 to 117oC, and 
the ring band width increases correspondingly.  As a matter of fact, dual types of spherulites, 
ring-banded and ringless, are present in POT films when crystallized.  Regime-III can be extended 
further below 106oC to as low as 70oC, where dual types of spherulites (ring-banded and ringless 
 12
narrow “extinction line” separating these two bands.  Later, SEM evidence will be discussed 
showing that the double bright-dark bands are hill-and-valley bands of different height but roughly 
equal width.  In addition to the different height, the crystal texture and/or orientation for these two 
bands may be different too.  At higher Tc (>115oC), the spherulite pattern is dramatically different, 
signaling transition into a different regime (Regime-II).  Micrographs (h) for Tc=120oC to (i) for 
Tc=125oC, in Regime-II, on the other hand, show no double rings but only widened ring bands.  
Ring patterns in Regime-II differ significantly from those in Regime-III.  In Regime-II, the 
inter-ring spacing and/or ring band width increases significantly and pattern of the rings becomes 
less ordered.  There are no double bright-dark bands in Regime-II; instead, there are only wide 
bright bands, separated by a narrow dark “extinction line” between the bands.  
Double ring-bands with two different colors under POM may be difficult for correctly estimating 
the inter-ring space.  Therefore, nonpolarized micrographs were also taken for comparison.  
Figure 15 shows OM photos (nonpolarized light) for POT melt-crystallized at various temperatures: 
(a) 85oC; (b) 90oC; (c) 95oC; (d) 100oC; (e) 105oC; (f) 110oC; (g) 115oC; (h) 120oC; (i) 125oC.  
Ring patterns are clearly seen in POT when crystallized at Tc=85~125oC.  More regular rings are 
seen in POT crystallized at lower Tc’s (85oC).  For POT crystallized at Tc = 115oC or above, the 
spherulites in POT start to exhibit distorted zigzag rings (Graph-f), with increasing irregularity at 
higher Tc’s.  Furthermore, the inter-band width increases sharply for POT crystallized at Tc equal 
to or greater than 115oC.  For POT crystallized at Tc = 120oC or higher (graph-h), rings are so 
irregular that measurement of inter-ring spacing was not possible.  For POT crystallized at Tc > 
90oC (Graphs b~e), the bands are of a “double-ring” pattern, which are composed of alternating 
bright-dark bands (roughly concentric or spiraling).   
Optical images of double-bands in spherulites require careful analysis.  Figure 16 shows 
non-polarized OM photos for the same POT sample crystallized at 115oC by focusing on different 
height positions: (a) up; (b) middle; and (c) down.  By focusing on different depth, the width of 
band stripes can vary.  The dark band (valley) width is narrower when focus is near the top and the 
width becomes slightly larger when focus is brought lower.  Its width becomes the larger when 
focus is placed closer to the valley plane.   
Note that the polarized light induces dual color bands within the double-band rings.  That is, the 
alternating bright and dark rings are actually one single crystal ring when viewed under 
non-polarized OM or SEM.  Further evidence will be provided by SEM characterization on the 
POT samples showing double ring bands under polarized light microscopy.  Ring spacing reported 
in this work is based on measurement of graphs taken under non-polarized OM.  Later, 
measurements based on SEM graphs will be discussed too, which would show that agreement in the 
inter-ring width can be reached between the non-polarized OM and SEM results. 
Earlier, it was mentioned that Regime-III of POT growth can be further down to 70oC.  An 
interesting phenomenon of dual types of spherulites was found in POT only when crystallized at 
low Tc.  Figure 17 shows dual types of spherulites, i.e., ring-banded and ring-less types, in POT 
melt-crystallized at 70oC.  Interesting two types of spherulites are clearly seen in POT 
 14
discussions on spherulite crystal patterns in polymers will not be complete without taking into 
account of both effects by Tmax and Tc. 
Thus, by summarizing the above observations, the trend of variation of POT spherulites is clear.  
At lower temperatures, POT exhibits higher crystallization rates that lead to ring-less spherulites; at 
higher temperatures, POT exhibits lower crystallization rates that lead to ring-banded spherulites.  
Eventually, at even higher temperatures of Regime-I (130oC and above), ring pattern is no longer 
seen and spherulites are highly dendritic.  Both ringless and ring-banded spherulites can be seen in 
Regime-III (70~118oC), where the relative fractions of two types of spherulites depend on 
temperature, with the former type decreasing with increasing temperature.  In Regime-II (Tc > 
118oC and above), the ring-band pattern is mostly distorted to zigzag irregularity, with significantly 
widened inter-ring spacing.  
It may yield useful clue to summarize the variation trend of inter-ring spacing in POT with 
respect to temperature of crystallization.  Figure 21 shows band width plotted as a function of Tc 
between 70 and 120oC.  Inter-ring spacing was estimated using two microscopic techniques (OM 
and SEM).  With increasing temperature, the average band width first stays almost stagnant with 
only slight increase between 70 and 85oC, with a dip cusp at ~90oC, but then increases rapidly at Tc 
higher than 110oC up to 120oC.  Note that the slight dip from the increasing trend at Tc = ~90oC 
may be attributed to a sudden increase in the fraction of double-ring spherulite, which exerts a more 
compact spacing in the single-band spherulite.  Experimentally under polarized light, POT 
crystallized at Tc = 85oC or lower exhibited no alternating bright-dark double-rings, while POT 
samples crystallized at 90oC (or above) displayed spherulites with distinct alternating bright-dark 
double-rings.  Inter-ring spacings in spherulites grown in different regimes were also measured 
using SEM technique.  The SEM data are plotted in the same figure, which shows quite good 
agreement between two set of data. 
 
Transition from double-bands to dendritic bands at higher Tc
Fig. 22 also shows that a distinct discontinuity in ring width, is located at Tc=115oC, where the 
inter-ring spacing starts to increase almost exponentially with temperature increase beyond 115oC.  
As discussed earlier, at this temperatures of Tc or above (Tc >115oC), the spherulites in POT start to 
exhibit highly irregular ring patterns; conversely, below this Tc, the spherulites are characterized 
with regularly concentric rings.  Note that this temperature of 115oC signals a transition from 
regular rings to irregular ones, which is accompanied with rapid increase in inter-ring spacing.  
The temperature of spherulite transition (ca. at ~115oC) roughly coincides with the growth regime 
transition from II to III at T=115oC as discussed in earlier figures.  The result in this work on POT 
further points out that growth regime transition can signal several different transitions in the 
spherulite patterns, such as inter-ring spacing, ring regularity.  Apparently, growth kinetic regime 
transition can be accompanied with a variety of pattern transitions in the spherulites, and not 
necessarily just a simple transition from ring-banded to ring-less patterns (or vise versa). 
As pointed out earlier, OM evidence shows that at lower temperatures (70 to 30oC), the 
 16
Regime-III (105oC), with increased inter-ring spacing.  Again, rings are concentric and ordered, 
but the lamellar stacks in bands are better defined and larger/longer.  The lamellae are single-rod 
like, with no branches, and are all aligned along the radial directions. The lamellar length in one 
single ring band in the 105oC-crystallized POT is about 2~3 　m.  Finally, Graph-(C) shows POT 
crystallized at a higher temperature, the intersecting point of Regime-III to Regime-II (Tc=115oC), 
which displays a significantly larger inter-ring spacing and the pattern becomes more rugged and 
distorted.  Again, alternating bands of flat valley and crystalline aggregates are clearly visible.  
The lamellar stacks in the ring bands of the spherulites are highly dendritic (branches with 
needle-like dendrites).  The inner rim of the band, where lamella stacks are rooted is partially 
smeared with less-defined shapes; by comparison, the outer rim of the band is lined with 
well-defined needle-like lamella stacks radiating out individually.  The lamellar length (radial 
direction from inner to outer rims) in one band is roughly 6~10 µm.  Graph-(C) shows clearly that 
the inter-band region appears feature-less with little sign of any crystal species.  The valley region 
may be owing to depletion of polymer species, rather than a result of 90-degree re-orientation of 
lamellae.  The valley region is also too wide for the lamellae to remain evenly “flat-on”.

會議認識國外學者、也同時前往參觀新加坡重要歷史景點。  
 
二、與會心得 
 
此次研討會雖然在亞洲國家舉辦，但是邀請的學者遍佈美洲，歐洲，甚至有
非洲國家來參加，且會議場所的安排皆很有規劃，使得整個會議的進行很順利，
這部份也值得我們學習。
