Abstract 
The effect of shape memory alloys (SMA) on the flutter behavior of buckled laminates by varying the SMA fiber 
spacing was investigated using the finite element method. The formulation of the location-dependent linear, nonlinear 
stiffness and mass matrices due to non-homogeneous material properties and the temperature-dependent recovery stress 
stiffness matrix were derived. The numerical results show that the increase in the SMA fiber volume fraction and pre-
strain may generate more recovery stress, and increase the stiffness of the SMA reinforced laminates. Therefore, the 
flutter boundary and critical buckling load of the plate may be increased significantly. All five types of panel behavior, 
namely flat, buckled, limit-cycle, periodic, and chaotic motions are clearly displayed and successively identified. The 
flutter boundary may be more efficiently modified by increasing the SMA fiber volume fraction to reinforce the center 
of the plate.

Introduction 
Panel flutter is the self-excited oscillation of the ex-
ternal skin of a flight vehicle and due to the dynamic 
instability of the inertia, elastic, and aerodynamic forces 
of the system. This type of aeroelastic instability has 
received much attention, and the related phenomenon are 
now reasonably well understood for two- and 
three-dimensional panels made of conventional isotropic 
materials [1, 2] and composite materials [3-5]. Recently, 
Kouchakzadeh et al. [6] presented a comprehensive re-
view of research on flutter analysis. They also examined 
nonlinear aeroelasticity of general laminated composite 
plates in supersonic flow. High-speed aircraft structural 
panels are subjected not only to aerodynamic loading, 
but also to aerodynamic heating, and this rise in tem-
perature may buckle the skin panels and exhaust the 
load-carrying capacity. Since 2006, numerous research-
ers have undertaken flutter analysis of functionally 
graded material (FGM) plates in which the mechanical 
properties vary continuously from one surface to the 
other.  
In contrast to FGMs, which are passively used as 
thermal barriers, shape memory alloys (SMAs) may be 
ingeniously embedded into the composite laminate to 
increase the load-carrying capacity. Interest in shape 
memory alloys has been growing over recent decades 
due to their remarkable properties and the development 
of SMART composites that are capable of adapting intel-
ligently to external disturbances [7-9]. Although many 
studies on the postbuckling analysis of SMA reinforced 
composite laminates [10-13] or the vibration analysis of 
buckled SMA reinforced composite laminates [14, 15] 
have been published, relatively few works have been 
devoted to the study of the flutter analysis of buckled 
SMA reinforced composite laminates [16, 17].  
Tawfik et al. [16] proposed a novel concept to em-
ploy SMA to suppress postbuckling deflection and in-
crease the flutter boundary. Specifically, they utilized a 
nonlinear finite element model to study the effectiveness 
of an SMA-embedded isotropic panel on the critical 
buckling temperature, postbuckling deflection, free vi-
bration and flutter boundary. Park et al. [17] studied the 
effects of the SMA on the critical temperature, thermal 
postbuckling deflection, natural frequency and critical 
dynamic pressure of the quasi-isotropic laminates. In 
summary, the higher the volume fraction and initial strain 
of the SMA fiber are, the stiffer the plate is. As a result, 
the critical buckling load is increased, the out-of-plane 
displacement of the buckled plate is decreased, the natu-
ral frequencies may be modified, and the flutter bound-
ary is increased by using SMA fibers. However, only 
three regions (flat, buckled, and flutter) of the stability 
boundaries divided by critical temperature boundary and 
linear flutter boundary were presented in these two ear-
lier studies. In other words, the limit-cycle, periodic, and 
chaotic motions were not identified in the flutter region. 
Recently, Kuo et al. [18] proposed the concept of 
non-uniformly distributed SMA to satisfy the weight 
limitations and the load-carrying capacity requirement. 
However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, no study 
to date has investigated the influence of SMA on the

D                    (14b) 
where a  is the nondimensional eigenvalue that is 
equal to the square of the nondimensional natural fre-
quencies. Eq. (14a) is a set of nonlinear algebraic equa-
tions that yields the static deflection of the buckled plate 
and Eq. (14b) is a set of linear equations for the determi-
nation of the dynamic behavior of the buckled plate.  
The nonlinear equation in Eq. (14a) is solved by 
Newton-Raphson method. After the equilibrium state is 
obtained, the nonlinear stiffness matrices  1N  and

rable. In other words, 50% of the weight and cost of 
SMA fibers may be reduced if the linear SMA fiber dis-
tribution function is adopted. 
The effects of prestrain on the nondimensional 
critical dynamic pressure ( A , C ) and nondimensional 
critical buckling loads ( BP , CP ) for [ /- /0SMA/- / ] 
laminates are shown in Figs. 5 and 6, instead of dis-
played in a traditional map in the  , crPP  space. 
These four values determine the three points A (0, A ), B 
( BP ,0), and C ( CP , C ) in the  , crPP  space which 
identifies the stability boundaries. Line AC and line BC 
may be determined and the flat (stable) region can be 
found. The other points and lines may be estimated ac-
cordingly. The buckling load crP  is obtained for the 
laminated plate with the graphite fibers orientated at 00 
and without the SMA reinforcement. 
The critical buckling load ( BP ) of the square SMA 
embedded angle-ply laminate with larger graphite fiber 
orientation is lower because its bending rigidity in the 
x  direction is lower. Therefore, the effect of SMA fiber 
on BP , CP , and A  is more obvious for 
[  /-  /0SMA/-  /  ] laminates with higher graphite 
fiber orientation. In addition, the nondimensional critical 
dynamic pressure ( C ) will not vary much with the in-
crease of the prestrain. In other words, point C moves to 
the right hand side horizontally in the  , crPP  space 
because the load-carrying capacity is increased with the 
increase of the prestrain.      
Fig. 7 shows the flutter coalescence plot of 
[ /- /0SMA/- / ] laminates discussed in Fig. 5. For 
 = 0, the eigenvalues of all modes of the plate are 
purely real. As  increases from zero, the eigenvalues 
of two modes approach each other and coalesce at a 
critical value of   , called cr , where flutter occurs. 
For all five cases, the coalescent pair is the first and sec-
ond modes of the plate. However, the second mode is the 
(1,2) mode instead of the (2,1) mode for the 
[15/-15/0SMA/-15/15] and [30/-30/0SMA/-30/30] laminates. 
The numbers in parentheses are the numbers of 
half-waves in the x  and y  directions. It is seen that 
the graphite fiber orientation and the SMA fibers may 
change the stiffness and mass of the plate. Accordingly, 
the sequence of the natural mode may be altered. Be-
cause the coalescent pair is the first two modes of the 
plate and the second mode is the (1,2) mode for the plate 
with smaller graphite fiber orientation, the effect of SMA 
fiber in increasing the flutter boundary is minor.  
Conclusions 
(1) The increase of SMA fiber volume fraction and pre-
strain may generate more recovery stress, and in-
crease the stiffness of the SMA reinforced laminate. 
Therefore, the flutter boundary and critical buckling 
load of the plate may be increased considerably.  
(2) All five types of panel behavior, namely flat, buckled, 
limit-cycle, periodic, and chaotic motions are clearly 
displayed and identified. 
(3) The flutter boundary may be more efficiently modi-
fied by increasing the SMA fiber volume fraction to 
reinforce the center of the plate. 
(4) The effect of SMA on flutter boundary and critical 
buckling load of the plate is more obvious for the 
SMA reinforced angle-ply laminate with higher fiber 
orientation.
