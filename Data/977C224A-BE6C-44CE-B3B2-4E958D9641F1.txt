to be globally asymptotically stable. Moreover, a unique situation for the Takagi-Sugeno
fuzzy system to be null-controllable is derived as well.
四、 結果與討論
Over the years, interval computation techniques are increasingly manifested in robust
stability analysis of uncertain systems described in terms of interval parameters and inter-
val matrices. Research on the analysis of interval matrices has been growing steadily since
the 1980s, such as the applications seen in Hurwitz stability ([5], [16], [25], [32], [48], [49],
[59], [25], [60]) and Schur stability ([7], [21], [31], [36], [42], [45]). It is necessary to know
that the classical problem of analysis and synthesis of control systems has by far maxi-
mized their usefulness in the Kharitonov’s Theorem ([26]) and the Edges Theorem ([6]).
Observing the development, stability is regarded as an important commodity in feedback
control, and thus the robust stability against parametric perturbations gain their status
and become considerably explicit in the literature. Indeed, as far as the stability tests are
concerned, it is not surprising to see the class of interval plants being widely embarked
on, for example, systems illustrated as transfer functions representing ratios of interval
polynomials. When tracing back, we can find the problem of robust stabilization of an
interval family was initially conducted and studied in Chapellat and Bhattacharyya ([13]).
The fact is that, in robust control, the power of an interval matrix has its predominance
in the scope of the controllability, observability, or impulse response of the interval system
([1], [2]). However, any in-depth studies on this problem are perceived scarce. It is due
to this fact that we make every possible endeavor to arrive at more sophisticated results.
Fuzzy systems have been employed in the control processes in many practical applica-
tions. Fuzzy systems of Takagi-Sugeno model [55] have recently attracted great interests
from scientists. The method of Takagi-Sugeno models gives an effective method to repre-
sent complex nonlinear systems with fuzzy sets and fuzzy reasoning. It is to combine some
simple local linear dynamic systems with their linguistic description to represent highly
nonlinear dynamic systems. This method is feasible since in many situations, human
experts can provide linguistic descriptions of local systems in terms of IF-THEN rules.
The method is quite interesting because it gives a way to smoothly connect local linear
systems to form global nonlinear systems with fuzzy membership functions. The stability
analysis is one of the most important concepts in Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems. Tanaka
and Sugeno [54] have provided a sufficient condition for the asymptotic stability of a fuzzy
system. Through the existence of a common Lyapunov function for all the subsystems
in [15], [50], [51], [54], [58], the condition is determined in the sense of Lyapunov. The
stability analysis and design problems for the discrete-time Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model
are considered in [24], [54], [56], [58]. Thathachar and Viswanath [56] showed the equiva-
lence of globally asymptotic stability of the Takagi-Sugeno free fuzzy system and that of
the linear time invariant switching system. Joh et al. [24] provided a systematic way of
finding a common symmetric positive matrix under the assumption of Shur and pairwise
commutative characteristic matrices. They showed that the common matrix can tolerate
perturbations of the assumption. The concept of parallel distributed compensation(PDC)
scheme is used to design regulators and fuzzy observers for the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy sys-
tems in [51], [54], [58]. In the PDC approach, each rule is designed from a corresponding
rule of a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy system. Applying the PDC method, the LMI-based fuzzy

Let ∗ ∈ {+,−, ·} be one of the usual binary operations on the set of real numbers R. For
X,Y ∈ I(R) we define
X ∗ Y = {x ∗ y : x ∈ X, y ∈ Y }.
The set Mn(IR) denotes all real n× n interval matrices.
For interval matrices (Aij) and (Bij), and an interval X ∈ I(R), the matrix operations
+,−, · are formally defined as
A± B = (Aij ±Bij),
A · B = (
∑
s

X · A = (X · Aij).
We review the deterministic Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy system [55]. Let x(k) = [x1(k), . . . ,
xn(k)]
T be state vector and u(k) = [u1(k), . . . , um(k)]
T be the control input vector for the
system at time instant k, respectively. For i = 1, 2, . . . , N , and Ai ∈ Rn×n, Bi ∈ Rn×m
The discrete fuzzy system is defined by the implications below:
Model Rule i : IF (x1(k) is S
i
1, AND,. . ., AND xn(k) is S
i
n)
THEN x(k + 1) = Aix(k) +Biu(k).
The continuous fuzzy system is defined by the implications below:
Model Rule i : IF (x1(k) is S
i
1, AND,. . ., AND xn(k) is S
i
n)
THEN x˙(k) = Aix(k) +Biu(k).
Note that Sij is the fuzzy set corresponding to xj and the implication RULE
i. The
truth value of RULEi at time instant k is defined as
wi(k) = ∧{µSi1(x1(k)), . . . , µSin(xn(k))},
where ∧ usually stands for the minimum operator and µS(x) is the value of membership
function of the fuzzy set S at position x. Then the state vector of discrete fuzzy system
and continuous fuzzy systems at time instant k + 1 is updated as follows, respectively.
x(k + 1) =
N∑
i=1
αi(k)[Aix(k) +Biu(k)], (1)
x˙(k) =
N∑
i=1
αi(k)[Aix(k) +Biu(k)], (2)
where αi(k) = wi(k)/
∑N
i=1wi(k).

The Takagi-Sugeno open-loop discrete fuzzy system turns into deterministic Takagi-
Sugeno open-loop fuzzy system when the characteristic interval matrices degenerate to
real matrices. Thus, the interval Takagi-Sugeno open-loop discrete fuzzy system can be
regarded as a kind of generalization of the deterministic Takagi-Sugeno open-loop fuzzy
system.
