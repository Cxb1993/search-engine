 
I. Introduction 
Accidental spill of nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) such as fuel, petroleum 
products, and chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents has caused serious soil contamination 
problems worldwide (Khachikian and Harmon 2000). These NAPL compounds have 
low water solubility, and thus serve as long-term sources of groundwater 
contamination (Mercer 1990). When released in the unsaturated zone, NAPLs travel 
downward and laterally toward the water table. Once reaching the water table, light 
NAPLs (LNAPLs) have the tendency to pool on the phreatic surface and dense 
NAPLs (DNAPLs) can continue to move downward to be trapped in the saturated soil 
medium. Therefore, NAPLs can contaminate both unsaturated and saturated 
subsurface once it is released to the soils. 
 In-situ air sparging (IAS) coupled with the soil vapor extraction (SVE) method 
has been a popular remediation alternative to clean up NAPL contaminants (Rogers 
and Ong 2000). In the SVE operation, a vacuum is induced in the unsaturated zone 
and thus volatile NAPLs are introduced into the air flow passing through the 
contaminated zone and removed from soils. In order to further extend the SVE 
process to remediate non-volatile compounds, a new process called soil ozonation has 
been developed (Sung and Huang 2002; Yoon, Kim et al. 2002; Shin, Garanzuay et al. 
2004). By injecting ozone gas into the SVE system, a faster removal rate can be 
achieved and no off-gas treatment units will be needed. This has greatly improved the 
traditional SVE system. However, past studies mainly focus on the application of soil 
ozonation on non-NAPLs, very few studies concentrate on NAPLs. As a result, the 
goal of this investigation concentrates on the feasibility study of ozonation of NAPLs 
in soils, and the development of predictive model for this process. 
The local equilibrium assumption (LEA) has been applied to describe mass 
transfer in some NAPL venting experiments (Hayden, Voice et al. 1994; HO, Liu et al. 
1994). However, it was later found that the LEA is limited and thus recently 
non-equilibrium transport models have been formulated in several applications 
(Harper, Stiver et al. 2003). To account for chemical reactions occurring in the soil 
ozonation system, non-equilibrium mass transfer coupled with reaction must be 
formulated into the model (Sung and Huang 2002; Shin, Garanzuay et al. 2004). 
Important dimensionless parameters such as Stanton number and Damkohler number 
have been found to critical in assessment of rate limiting steps during an operation 
(Sung and Huang 2002). The objectives of this study were to develop mathematical 
models to describe the soil ozonation of NAPL-contaminated soils, to determine 
important dimensionless that controls the process, and finally to conduct laboratory 
experiments to optimize the model.  
The scaled dimensionless governing equations become

where St is the Stanton’s number and equals )/1()/( gaig kvl , representing the rate of 
ozone gas convection to mass transfer; Da1, Da2, and Da3 are the Damkohler’s 
number and equal respectively )/1()/( 0zrg Ckvl , )/1()/( srg Ckvl ν , and 
)/1()/( dg kvl , representing the rate of VOC gas convection to chemical reaction with 
ozone, the rate of ozone gas convection to chemical reaction with VOC, and the rate 
of ozone gas convection to its self-decomposition. The above equations were solved 
by the numerical scheme utilizing Crank-Nicolson’s central difference method. 
 
III. Experiments 
Commercial sands with an average size of 0.31 mm were used for the experiments as 
pure silica soil materials. Stainless steel columns were used to conduct laboratory 
experiments. A schematic description of the experimental system is shown in Figure 1 
below.

Figure 1. Experimental design of laboratory soil colum,n experiment. 
 
The ozone generator (Model OZ2BTUSL-V/PM) manufactured by Ozotech Inc. 
(Yreka, CA, USA) was employed to produce ozone from the oxygen tank. Prior to 
entering the soil column, ozone gas was forced to pass through a saturator filled with 
HClO4 solution at pH 2.5. Two columns with identical dimensions were connected in 
parallel. A three-way valve was placed so that ozone can only enter one column at a 
time. The reference column of soil was prepared following the same procedure as the 
transfer, and a small Da1 implies that the rate of chemical reaction is much slower 
than convective mass transfer. Overall, it demonstrates a condition where various 
rates have the following sequence: interfacial mass transfer >> convection >> 
chemical reaction. Figure 4 indicates that the toluene vapor profiles become 
independent of reaction times, whereas Figure 5 shows that the ozone gas distribution 
is strongly dependent on reaction times. In Figure 4, note that the toluene vapor 
remains nearly saturated when the column length (η) is greater than 0.2 while the 
ozone gas concentration is dependent on column length at different times. The reason 
that the VOC can remain saturated is because the rate of mass transfer is so fast that it 
is replenished in the column immediately after it is consumed. The rate of mass 
transfer will become slow only when the residual NAPL becomes significantly less. 
This is what occurs when the length is less than 0.2.

3. Ozonation of NAPL-Contaminated Soil Column 
Figure 9 below shows results of venting experiments using N2 gas alone. This is , in 
fact, the condition to mimic soil vapor extraction (SVE). It was observed that the 
toluene vapor concentration gradually increased within 5 minutes and then maintained 
at a saturated concentration of about 23 ppm for 20 minutes before it slowly decreased 
to a minimum at 60 minutes. However, when the O3 gas was applied, significantly 
different toluene breakthrough curves (BTCs) were observed. Figure 10 demonstrates 
results when O3 was injected to the identical column as in Figure 9. It was seen that at 
the initial 5 minutes there was no breakthrough concentration of toluene. This is 
because toluene is consumed by O3 through gas phase reactions. Although toluene 
also reached the peak concentration of 23 ppm, the duration is much shorter due to 
chemical reactions. The benefit of adding O3 to the system was that the total amount 
of toluene vapor was reduced due to reaction as can be seen by comparing areas under 
the toluene BTCs, which represent the total mass of toluene vapor. In addition, O3 
breaks through the column at almost the time as toluene and gradually reached the 
inlet concentration at about 30 minutes.

toluene is in the middle of the column. 
 
Figures 11 and 12 are results conducted under different O3 flow rates of 200 and 50 
mL/min, respectively. It is seen from Figure 11 that at a higher flow rate of ozone 
(compared to 150 mL/min) both toluene vapor and O3 would exit the column at a 
faster rate. The effects of flow rate become significant when the flow rate reduces to

V. Conclusions 
The rate limiting step in the soil ozonation process for NAPL remediation can be 
determined using dimensionless variables, i.e., Stanton’s and Damkohler’s numbers, 
derived from this investigation. Both ozone and VOC column profiles under various 
rates of interfacial mass transfer, convection, and chemical reaction can be obtained to 
understand profile behaviors. The simulated results revealed that the process can be 
most efficiently operated when the rate of reaction is much faster than the rate of mass 
transfer (e.g., St = 0.01, and Da1 = 100). In laboratory soil column experiments, it was 
found that by injecting ozone gas into the column the overall removal rate of NAPL 
can be enhanced. In the case of toluene, it was observed that when different ozone 
flow rates were applied the saturated vapor concentration remains the same, indicating 
a mass transfer control process. The overall rate of removal can be increased by 
increasing ozone gas concentration.
