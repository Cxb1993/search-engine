一、中英文摘要
一個圖型中，如果任意兩點都存在有漢彌爾
連線，我們稱這個圖為漢彌爾連通。圖型
中，任意兩個漢彌爾頓路徑 P1 =< u1, u2,…,
u|V| >和 P2 = <v1, v2, …, v|V| > 稱為相互獨
立，如果滿足u1 = v1, v|V| = u|V|, 且 vi≠ui 對
1 < i < |v|。在三正則圖中，如果任意兩點都
有二條相互獨立的漢彌爾頓路徑，我們稱該
圖是雙-獨立漢彌爾頓連通。一個圖型，我
們稱為 1-漢彌爾頓，如果這個圖壞了一條
線或是一個點都還是漢彌爾頓。一個圖型，
我們稱為超 3*-連通，如果這個圖中任意兩
點，我們都可找到 1、2、3條互斥生成路徑。
在本計劃中，我們証明，三正則雙-獨立漢
彌爾頓連通就是 1-漢彌爾頓。我們也給了
一些三正則雙-獨立漢彌爾頓連通且超 3*-
連通圖，一些三正則雙-獨立漢彌爾頓連通
但不是超 3*-連通圖，一些超 3*-連通，但
不是三正則雙-獨立漢彌爾頓連通圖，一些
三正則 1-漢彌爾頓，但不是雙-獨立漢彌爾
頓連通也不是超 3*-連通圖。

A graph G = (V,E) is hamiltonian connected if
there exists a hamiltonian path between any
two vertices in G. Let P1 = (u1,u2,…,u|V|) and
P2= (v1,v2,…,v|V|) be any two hamiltonian
paths of G. We say that P1 and P2 are inde-
pendent if u1 = v1, u|V| = v|V|, and ui≠vi for 1 <
i < |V|. A cubic graph G is 2-independent
hamiltonian connected if there are two inde-
pendent hamiltonian paths between any two
different vertices of G. A graph G is 1-hamil-
tonian if G - F is hamiltonian for any F be a
subset of V union E with |F| = 1. A graph G is
super 3*- connected if there exist i internal
disjoint paths spanning G for i = 1,2,3. It is
proved that every super 3*- connected graph
is 1- hamiltonian. In this project, we prove
that every cubic 2-independent hamiltonian
con- nected graph is also 1-hamiltonian. We
present some cubic 2-independent hamiltonian
con- nected graphs that are super 3*-
connected, some cubic 2-independent hamil-
tonian con-nected graphs that are not super
3*-connected, some super 3*-connected
graphs that are not 2-independent hamiltonian
connected, and some cubic 1-hamiltonian
graphs that are hamiltonian connected but
neither 2-independent hamiltonian connected
nor super 3*- connected.
Keywords: hamiltonian, hamiltonian con-
nected, connectivity.

Super 3*-connected graphs
Cubic 2-independent
hamiltonian connected graphs
Cubic hamiltonian connected graphs
Cubic 1-hamiltonian graphs
Globally 3*-connected graphs
vertices u and v if G is k-connected. A
k*-container C(u,v) of G is a k-container such
that every vertex of G is incident with some
path in C(u,v). A graph is k*-connected if
there exists a k*-container C(u,v) between any
two distinct vertices u and v. Obviously, a
graph G is 1*-connected if and only if it is
hamiltonian connected. Moreover, a graph G
is 2*-connected if and only if it is hamiltonian.
It is known that every hamiltonian connected
graph is hamiltonian. Thus, every 1*-con-
nected graph is also 2*-connected. In parti-
cular, every cubic 2-independent hamiltonian
connected graph is i*-connected with i = 1,2.
We also note that every 1-hamiltonian graph G
is hamiltonian because G-e is hamiltonian for
any edge e in G. Thus, every 1-hamiltonian
graph is 2*-connected.
Thus, the concept of k*-connected is a hybrid
concept of hamiltonicity and connectivity. The
concept of k*-connected is proposed by Lin et.
al. [8], which is motivated by the concept of
globally 3*-connected graphs proposed by
Albert, Aldred, and Holton [1]. A globally
3*-connected graph is a cubic 3*-connected
graph. It is proved in [7] that every globally
3*-connected graph is 1-hamiltonian. Thus,
every globally 3*-connected is also 2*-con-
nected. However, not every globally 3*-con-
nected graph is 1*-connected. Thus, Kao et. al.
[7] introduce the concept of super 3*-con-
nected. A super 3*-connected graph is a cubic
graph that is i*-connected for i = 1,2,3.
In Figure 1, we use Venn diagram to illustrate
the relation between cubic 1-hamiltonian
graphs, globally 3*-connected graphs, super
3*-connected graphs, cubic hamiltonian con-
nected graphs, and cubic 2-independent hamil-
tonian connected graphs. The set of cubic
2-independent Hamiltonian connected graphs
corresponds to regions 1 and 2; the set of
cubic 1-hamiltonian graphs corresponds to
regions 1, 2, 3, 4, ,5 and 6; the set of globally
3*-connected graphs corresponds to regions 2,
4, and 5; the set of cubic hamiltonian con-
nected graphs corresponds to regions 1, 2, 3, 4,
and 7; the set of super 3*-connected graphs
corresponds to regions 2 and 4.

We are wondering the existence of graphs for
all the possible regions. It is proved the
existence of graphs in regions 5, 6, and 7 [7].
We will presents some examples of graphs in
regions 1,2, 3, and 4.
Theorem 1: Every cubic 2-independent hamil-
tonian connected graph is 1-hamiltonian.
Theorem 2: P(n, 1) is cubic 2-independent
hamiltonian connected and super 3*-con-
nected if and only if n is odd.
Theorem 3: L(k) is super 3*-connected but not
cubic 2-independent hamiltonian connected if
k is even and k ≧ 4.
Theorem 4: N is cubic 2-independent hamil-
