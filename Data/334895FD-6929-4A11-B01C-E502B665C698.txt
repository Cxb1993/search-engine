 中文摘要 
 
目前以錫為基材(Sn-based)的無鉛銲料已是國際間各大電子公司所採用之
主要電子銲料，然而隨著產品使用經驗的增加，發現此一系列的銲料在提昇可靠
度方面，仍有進一步改善的空間，而其中又發現以銲點的界面反應對於可靠度的
影響最為直接。近年來國際間許多研究團隊，嘗試在銲料中添加微量的合金元素，
來抑制 Cu3Sn 介金屬的生長並進一步減少伴隨 Cu3Sn 生成的 Kirkendall voids
數目，以提昇銲點的性能及可靠度。因為目前已有文獻證實，Kirkendall voids
的生成確實會造成銲點可靠度的降低。 
研究團隊在添加微量合金元素研究方面，曾進行過添加 Ni、Fe、Co等研究，
並獲得顯著的成果。在 2002年本研究團隊首次發現添加微量 Ni元素能有效的抑
制 SnAg 及 SnAgCu 銲料與 Cu 反應時界面 Cu3Sn 的生長。後續研究更發現添加微
量 Fe或 Co元素也有相同之效果，並首次証實元素添加量即使小到 100 ppm (0.01 
wt.%) 仍有效果。國際上進行添加微量合金元素的研究所採用的合金包含有Ni、
Fe、Co、Mn、Ge、Ti、Si、Cr 以及 Zn，其中又以添加微量 Zn 元素的研究最為大
家所重視。因為已有文獻報導添加 Zn 能有效的改善銲料的機械性質，但是關於
添加 Zn 對界面反應的影響仍尚未有完整的探討。本研究團隊在 2006 年首次提出
銲料中添加 Zn的濃度會對於界面反應產生非常大的影響，更於 2008 年初步的證
實添加 Zn 濃度的效果受銲料體積效應的影響，如此的研究成果也吸引著積極從
事無鉛銲料研發的 CPU連接器大廠--嘉澤端子的重視，加上本研究團隊在添加微
量合金元素研究以及銲料體積效應研究上豐富的經驗以及成熟的技術，因此促成
了此產學合作計畫的提出。 
本計畫的目標是深入的了解，在工業界實際使用的銲料體積下，元素的添加
對無鉛銲料與 Cu 反應所產生之影響。本研究除了將對現象作一完整觀察與描述
外，並將對其機制作深入探討。嘉澤端子將提供工業界在無鉛銲料開發的實務經
驗，並結合本研究團隊在添加 Zn元素研究的學術理論成果。本計畫目標完成後，
將可提供嘉澤端子在無鉛銲料開發上的銲料選擇，也可提供本研究團隊建立不同
體積下、不同 Zn 添加元素濃度下，介金屬生長的動力學與擴散動力學資料，為
本團隊在無鉛銲料領域的研究奠立更完整的理論研究基礎。

三、 研究方法 
本研究使用 Sn-xZn 及 Sn-xZn-yCu 銲料[x 及 y 代表重量百分比，x=0.5-2，
y=1-2]，依各銲料的重量百分比，將適量高純度的 Sn (99.99%)、Zn(99.9%)、
Cu(99.99%)元素以電子天平秤取，放入石英管中真空封合，置入高溫爐中熔融，
溫度為 800oC，時間 72 小時，每隔一段時間，頇取出石英管搖晃，此舉主要是
為了讓銲料完全均勻混合，最後將石英管由高溫爐中取出後淬火。此外，本研究
所使用的 Cu(99.999%)片為長寬各 10mm、厚 0.8mm。反應前 Cu 片必頇用使用
鹽酸酸洗，以除去表面的氧化物及汙染物。最後沾上 Flux，置入 6g 熔融銲料中，
反應溫度為 250oC，反應時間 2 分鐘。反應完成後淬火使試片冷卻至室溫，即完
成試片之反應。為了觀察體積的影響，亦將配置的合金製作成 10mg 的銲錫球與
Cu 板進行反應，初步觀察體積的影響。 
將反應完成之試片，以金相研磨、拋光界面之截面，再以不同之儀器觀測
其結構及組成。欲使用 TEM 觀察之試放入通入液態氮的離子減薄機(Ion Miller)
中修薄，離子束能量為 4.5 keV，轟擊角度 2-6 度。使用一般常見之加速電壓
200keV 的穿透式電子顯微鏡進行觀察，並利用其附加之能量分散式 X-光儀
(Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer: EDS)分析界面化合物之組成。 
 
四、 實驗結果 
1. Zn 濃度對界面反應之影響 
在 Sn-Zn 銲料與 Cu 的反應中，界面的反應生成物將會隨著 Zn 濃度的改變
而截然不同。圖一為 Sn-Zn 銲料與 Cu 在 250oC 下反應 2 分鐘之界面反應情形。
在 Sn 中添加 0.5 wt.% Zn 並不會改變界面上的化學反應，主要反應仍為 Sn 與
Cu 的反應，界面的生成物為 Cu6Sn5，但 Zn 會溶入生成之 Cu6Sn5 中[圖一(a)]。
當 Zn 濃度提高至 0.7 wt.%，與 Cu 基板接觸的是一層連續之 Cu6Sn5介金屬，此
外亦觀察到一層 CuZn 介金屬生成於 Cu6Sn5 與銲料之間[圖一(b)]。當 Zn 濃度
提高至 1 wt.%，界面不再是常見的 Cu-Sn 反應，而是以 Cu-Zn 反應為界面的主
要反應，反應生成物則轉變為 CuZn[圖一(c)]。對於此 Zn 濃度效應，本實驗室
也使用了 Sn-Cu-Zn 三元相圖給予一個合理的解釋[8]。 
此外，Sn-0.5Zn 與 Cu 反應之後，繼續放入 160oC 的烘箱中進行熱處理 1000
小時，界面生成之介金屬皆為貝殼狀 Cu6Sn5，然而微量 Zn 濃度的添加卻抑制
界面上具脆性之 Cu3Sn 的生成，如圖二(a)。利用 EPMA 對界面的反應生成物進
行 line-scan分析，發現在介金屬與Cu的界面處有Zn的訊號被偵測到[圖二(b)]。
本實驗室更近一步使用 TEM 對於介金屬與 Cu 之界面進行分析，在 Cu3Sn 與
Cu 的界面上觀察到一層富 Zn 層的存在，如圖三(a)所示；並針對此富 Zn 相進
行 EDX 分析[圖三(b)]。由以上結果可知，當銲料中添加微量 Zn 時，Zn 原子會
 六、 計畫成果自評 
本計畫所規劃之各研究項目均在執行期間內順利達成預定執行工作及目標。
本研究提供產業界一個評估添加不同濃度 Zn 對於銲料影響之依據，藉此尋求最
佳之銲點組成。此外，本研究計畫在一年的期間已產出 18 篇國際期刊論文[10-27]。
除了研究上的成果，在工業上亦具有重大的應用價值，可說成果相當豐碩。 
此外，目前本實驗室已獲得多家公司之產學合作研究計畫，希望可以將研究
成果技轉給業界，以提升相關產業的技術水平，力求在學界與業界都能夠有所貢
獻。

Effect of Sn concentration on massive spalling in high-Pb
soldering reaction with Cu substrate
M.H. Tsai,a) Y.W. Lin, H.Y. Chuang, and C.R. Kaob)

(Received 10 June 2009; accepted 7 August 2009)
The massive spalling of Cu3Sn in the soldering reaction between high-Pb solders and
Cu substrates was studied to identify the mechanism behind this rather interesting
and frequently observed phenomenon. Four different alloys (99.5 Pb 0.5 Sn, 99 Pb 1S n,
97 Pb 3 Sn, and 95 Pb 5 Sn, in wt%) were soldered at 350 C for durations ranging
from 10 s to 600 min. At low Sn concentration (0.5 or 1 Sn), massive spalling occurred
as early as 20 min. However, at high Sn concentration (3 or 5 Sn), massive spalling
was not completed even after 600 min. To the best of our knowledge, these results
are the most detailed observations ever reported on the sequence of events that occur
during massive spalling. The Pb–Sn–Cu phase diagram is used to rationalize the
phenomenon.
I. INTRODUCTION
Solder alloys play an important role in electronic
packaging; in particular, PbSn alloys are very frequently
used for flip-chip applications.1 During the soldering
reaction, one or more intermetallic compounds are
formed at the substrate–solder interface, and the integ-
rity of these intermetallics has a profound effect on the
reliability of the produced electronic devices. Recently,
considerable attention has been paid to the massive spall-
ing of intermetallics, that is, large-scale detachment of
intermetallics from the interface during soldering or
aging. Spalling has been observed in several substrate–
solder systems, for example, PbSn soldered on Ni,2
SnCu on Ni,3 SnAgCu on Ni,4,5 SnZn on Cu,6 and PbSn
aged on Cu.7 A unified thermodynamic rationalization
was subsequently proposed to explain the driving force
behind the massive spalling in these systems.8 Accord-
ing to this argument, if the most reactive constituent in
the solder is present in a limited amount and if its con-
centration decreases below a certain level during the
reaction, the original reaction product formed at the in-
terface is no longer in local thermodynamic equilibrium
with the solder. The original reaction product as a result
detaches itself from the interface and spalling occurs.
Because the amount of the most reactive constituent
has a marked influence on massive spalling, it is desir-
able to quantitatively analyze the effect of reactive ele-
ment concentration on massive spalling. In high-Pb
solders, Sn is the reactive constituent, and the objective
of this study is to understand the effect of Sn concen-
tration on the massive spalling during the high-Pb/Cu
soldering reaction.
II. EXPERIMENTAL
Rectangular Cu substrate plates of dimension 25 
10  4 mm were mirror-polished on both faces, etched
with 50% nitric acid to remove the surface oxide layer,
and fluxed with a commercial mildly activated rosin flux
in preparation for the soldering reaction. PbxSn solder
alloys with four different Sn concentrations (x = 0.5,
1, 3, and 5 wt%) were prepared by first melting the pure
elements in an evacuated quartz tube and then placing it
in a furnace at 300 C for 1 wk for alloy homogeniza-
tion. Elemental Sn and Pb with purity >99.99 wt% were
used for alloy preparation.
Each solder bath was formed by placing 12 g of solder
into a quartz tube of 10-mm inside diameter. Each fluxed
Cu substrate was immersed in the fresh solder bath at
350 C. The reaction time ranged from 10 s to 600 min.
After the reaction, the tube along with the solder was
immediately quenched in water. Samples for cross-sec-
tional examination were prepared by two techniques:
(i) conventional metallographic grinding and polishing
and (ii) ion-milling cross-sectional polishing (E-3500;
Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The ion-milling polishing has
the benefit of less sample damage but is more time
consuming. The ion-milling polishing also does not re-
quire surface etching by any chemical reagents. The
compositions of the phases were determined by a state-
of-the-art field-emission electron probe micro-analyzer
(FE-EPMA; JXA-8500F; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan).

to speculate that, for the lower Sn content cases (0.5 and
1 wt% Sn), (Pb) might also be unobservable if the reaction
time was <10 s. Another interesting observation was that
high Sn concentration was able to retard or delay the oc-
currence of the massive spalling. For 5 wt% Sn, massive
spalling did not occur even after 600 min of reaction, as
shown in Fig. 3(e). It should be emphasized that reaction
time >5 min is rarely used in industry. The purpose of
using these exceeding long reaction durations in this study
is to provide more observations for uncovering the under-
lying mechanism. These observations are also helpful in
establishing the safe outer limits before inducing any voids
near the interface.
IV. DISCUSSION
During the soldering reaction, the Sn atoms in solder
reacted with Cu to form Cu3Sn at the interface. If the
amount of solder had been small, as in flip-chip solder
joints, the Sn concentration in solder would have
decreased as Cu3Sn grew thicker. Nevertheless, in this
study, the amount of solder was purposely set to be
large (12 g) compared to the amount of Cu3Sn formed at
the interface. Consequently, the Sn concentration in solder
stayed nearly constant. It was estimated that, at the most,
<0.1 wt% of the Sn atoms in solder was consumed.
There is no experimental Pb–Sn–Cu isotherm at temper-
atures close to that of this study. However, Zeng and
Kivilahti9 calculated the Pb–Sn–Cu isotherm at 350 C
using the CALPHAD approach. This isotherm is redrawn
in Fig. 4 and will be used in the following discussion.
Although the kinetics of spalling is different for dif-
ferent Sn concentrations, with a slower kinetics for
higher Sn concentrations, the sequence of events during
spalling did seem to be the same in the entire Sn concen-
tration range used in this study. Accordingly, in the
discussion here, it is assumed that the spalling follows
the sequence of events summarized below. When the
solder came into contact with Cu, a layer of Cu3Sn
quickly formed at the interface, producing the solder/
Cu3Sn/(Cu) materials sequence [see Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)].
Here the notation (Cu) is used to represent the fcc
Cu phase (pure Cu or Cu–Sn solid solution phase). The
corresponding diffusion path is shown in Fig. 4(a). As the
reaction time increased, a (Cu) + (Pb) two-phase region
appeared between Cu3Sn and Cu, producing the solder/
Cu3Sn/(Pb) + (Cu)/(Cu) materials sequence [see Figs. 1(c)
and 1(d) or 3(e)]. The corresponding diffusion path is
shown in Fig. 4(b). As the reaction time increased further,
a continuous (Pb) layer appeared, producing the solder/
Cu3Sn/(Pb)/(Pb) + (Cu)/(Cu) materials sequence [see
Figs. 1(e) or 2(b)]. The corresponding diffusion path is
shown in Fig. 4(c).
Starting from the materials sequence solder/Cu3Sn/
(Cu), let us analyze the driving force for the formation
of (Pb) regions between Cu3Sn and (Cu). At the early
stage, because Cu3Sn was in direct contact with the Cu
substrate, which was pure Cu initially, Sn in Cu3Sn
would diffuse into the Cu substrate, turning pure Cu into
the Cu–Sn solid solution (Cu). Nevertheless, for the en-
tire concentration range of (Cu), only point A in Fig. 4(a)
can be in equilibrium with Cu3Sn. The rest of (Cu) pre-
fers to be in equilibrium with (Pb), as reflected by the
(Cu) + (Pb) two-phase field in Fig. 4. Accordingly, if the
Sn concentration in (Cu) had not reached point A yet,
(Cu) was not in local thermodynamic equilibrium with
Cu3Sn. Two things could happen to bring the interface
back to local thermodynamic equilibrium: (i) dissolving
more Sn into (Cu) so that its concentration became point
A or (ii) forming (Pb) phase next to (Cu). Because the
diffusion of Sn in Cu was a slow process, the formation
of (Pb) might actually be a faster route to bring the inter-
face into local thermodynamic equilibrium. This was in
fact what had happened, as was observed in this study.

95Pb-5Sn solder in the solder bump relative to the
37Pb-63Sn content in the screen-printed solder
paste was 16:5. With this mass ratio, these two
solders, when completely mixed, will from an alloy
with an overall composition of 81Pb-19Sn. Detailed
description of the flip-chip solder joints and the
assembly process has been provided in a previous
publication,27 and is omitted here.
After assembly, the samples were subjected to
high-temperature storage at 100C, 130C, 150C or
175C for different periods of time. After aging, the
solder joints were mounted in epoxy and metallo-
graphically polished to reveal the interface and the
internal microstructure. Image analysis software
was used to measure the thickness of the layer of
intermetallic compounds. The thickness of each
layer was defined as the total area occupied by the
intermetallic compound divided by the linear length
of the interface. A state-of-the-art field-emission
electron probe microanalyzer (FE-EPMA, JXA-
8500F; JEOL Tokyo, Japan) operated at 15 keV was
used to identify the composition of the reaction
products. During the microprobe measurement, Ka,
Ka, and La x-rays were detected for Cu, Ni, and Sn,
respectively. In the microprobe analysis, the con-
centrations of each of these elements were mea-
sured independently, and the total weight
percentage was within 100 ± 1 wt.% in each case.
For every data point, at least four measurements
were made, and the average value is reported.
RESULTS
In this study, the cross-sectional microstructures
from the center bump of the first outer row of
each package were examined. As reported in our
previous study,27 after assembly, intermixing of
95Pb-5Sn and 37Pb-63Sn was relatively limited.
There was only a very thin layer of NiSn inter-
metallic compound near the chip side. The thick-
ness of this layer was too thin to be positively
identified by FE-EPMA, but this layer was likely
Ni3Sn4.
27 On the substrate side, an outer layer of
Cu6Sn5 and an inner layer of Cu3Sn existed in the
as-assembled condition.27
Figure 2 shows the microstructure evolution for
solder joints aged at 130C to 175C for 100 h to
2000 h. The initial small Sn-rich grains (the dark
regions) coarsened into larger grains with aging, as
shown in Fig. 2a–d. However, coarsening was not
the only process at work. There was a second and
parallel process that controlled the microstructure
of the solder, i.e., consumption of Sn atoms due to
the intermetallic formations at both interfaces. As
shown in Fig. 2e–h and i–l, the amount of the
Sn-rich phase decreased with aging. Accompanying
this decrease of the Sn-rich phase, the intermetallic
layer thickness at both interfaces increased with
aging. At 175C, the Sn-rich phase had almost been
completely exhausted after 3000 h of aging, as
shown in Fig. 3.
The growth of intermetallic compounds at 175C
during aging at both interfaces is shown in Fig. 4.
Regarding the types of compound formed at the
interface, the results shown in Fig. 4 are typical. The
formation and microstructure at other temperatures
were similar, only at slower rates. On the chip side,
there was initially only (Ni,Cu)3Sn4, as shown in
Fig. 4a. Nevertheless, when the aging time reached
2000 h, the Ni UBM layer had been completely
consumed, and (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 started to formed
between (Ni,Cu)3Sn4 and solder, as shown in Fig. 4c.
The exact composition of the intermetallics, as
determined by using FE-EPMA, is marked in Fig. 4.
It should be emphasized that our results repeatedly
showed that (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 would not form between
(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 and solder until the Ni UBM had been
completely consumed. This result suggested that,
when the Ni atoms from the Ni UBM were no longer
available, the original (Ni0.82,Cu0.18)3Sn4 layer
would be gradually converted into (Cu0.6Ni0.4)6Sn5
due to the continuous incoming Cu flux from the
other side of the solder joint.
On the substrate side, there were two interme-
tallic compounds, Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn, formed on Cu,
as shown in Fig. 4b and d. FE-EPMA analysis did
not detect any Ni signal within the Cu6Sn5 and
Cu3Sn layers. The thickness ratio of Cu6Sn5 to
Cu3Sn also changed with aging time, from about 1:1
at 1000 h to 1:3 at 2000 h. In the reaction of Cu with
Sn-rich solder, this ratio tends to stay at 1:1 after an
extended period of aging at high temperature. This
was due to the fact that, in this study, the supply of
Sn was limited. As demonstrated in Fig. 3, the
Sn-rich phase was consumed relatively fast at
175C. The Sn content in solder decreased with
aging. When the Sn content of the solder decreased,
the net reaction at the interface became the con-
sumption of the Cu6Sn5 layer to form the Cu3Sn

eutectic Sn-Pb presolder after assembly. The Ni UBM thickness was
about 3 lm.

consumption rate in the 95Pb-5Sn bump/37Pb-63Sn
presolder combination was slower than with pure
eutectic Sn-Pb solder. This was probably due to
the fact that there was less Sn available in the
95Pb-5Sn bump/37Pb-63Sn presolder combination.
The formation of microvoids between Cu3Sn and
Cu was also observed in this study, as shown in
Fig. 9. The formation of such microvoids had been
reported in the reaction between lead-free solders
and Cu as well as between 37Pb-63Sn and Cu7–9 but
never in systems involving high-lead solders. The
mechanism for the formation of the microvoids was
probably the same as that in lead-free solders as
well as in 37Pb-63Sn; it was probably due to faster
diffusion of Cu in Cu3Sn compared with that of Sn.
It should be emphasized that these microvoids only
appeared after an extended period of aging, such as
Fig. 4. Microstructures of interfaces after aging at 175C for 1000 h and 2000 h.

solder can be consumed by formation of interme-
tallic compounds. Compared with pure 37Pb-63Sn
bumps, the Ni consumption rate of the UBM was
higher when the 95Pb-5Sn bump/37Pb-63Sn pre-
solder combination was used. On the other hand,
the Cu consumption rate on the substrate side for
the 95Pb-5Sn bump/37Pb-63Sn presolder combina-
tion was slower than for pure 37Pb-63Sn. The for-
mation of microvoids was observed, for the first time
for high-lead solder, but these voids formed only
after extended periods of solid-state aging at high
temperature, such as after 100 h at 175C, after
500 h at 130C, or after 1500 h at 100C.

lution will be studied using solders joints of several different sizes.
To achieve the objective, three parameters: (1) the initial Cu con-
centration in solder, (2) the number of reﬂow, and (3) the solder
ball size are studied.
2. Experimental
The schematic drawing of the solders joint used in this study is shown in Fig. 1.
Solderballs of fourdifferent compositions Sn3AgxCu (x=0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7wt.%) and four
different diameters (djoint), 400, 500, 760, and 960m, were employed to study the
inﬂuenceof theCuconcentrationand the solder volume. The solder volumeratios for
the 400, 500, 760, and 960mballs are approximately 1:2:7:14. The soldering pads
of the substrates used in this study had an OSP surface ﬁnish over the electroplated
Cu layer. The pad-opening diameter (dpad) was ﬁxed at 600m. Using solder balls
of four different sizes over the substrates of a single size allowed one to investigate
the effect of solder volume in a well-controlled manner.
Before soldering, every substrate was ﬂuxed with a mildly activated rosin ﬂux,
and the solder ballswere then planted on the soldering pads. The reﬂowproﬁle used
had a peak reﬂow temperature of 235±2 ◦C and a 90 s duration during which the
solder was molten. The nominal ramp rate and cooling rate were both 1.5 ◦C/s. The
number of reﬂow cycles was from one to ﬁve times.
After soldering, the samples were mounted in epoxy, and polished to reveal
the interfaces and internal microstructures. The samples were then etched with a
5vol.% HCl (in methanol) solution for a few seconds to reveal the cross-sectional
microstructures. The etchant for the top-view micrographs was a 30vol.% HNO3
aqueous solution. The etching time depended on the thickness of the remaining
solder to be removed. The thickness of the intermetallic compounds (TIMC) formed
and the consumedCu layer thickness (TCu)wasmeasured by using an image analysis
software. The consumed Cu layer thickness was measured by comparing the un-
reacted Cu (which was protected by the solder mask, see Fig. 1) and the reacted Cu
from the same solder joint.
The reaction zone for each solder joint was examined by using a scanning elec-
tron microscope (SEM). The composition of the reaction product was identiﬁed by
a state-of-the-art ﬁeld-emission electron probemicroanalyzer (FE-EPMA, JEOL JXA-
8500F) operated at 15keV. During microprobe measurements, the detected X-rays
were K, L, and L for Cu, Ag, and Sn, respectively. In microprobe analysis, the
concentrations of each elementweremeasured independently, and the total weight
percentage was within 100±1wt.% in each case. For every data point, at least four
measurements were made and the average value was reported.
3. Results
For all the experimental conditions (different solder composi-
tions, different ball sizes, and different numbers of reﬂow) used in
this study, there was only one reaction product, Cu6Sn5, formed at
the interface. The other common Cu–Sn compound, Cu3Sn, was not
detected between Cu and Cu6Sn5. This observation was consistent
with previous studies [7–22]. Higher temperatures or a longer time
than thoseused in this studywerenecessary inorder forCu3Sn tobe
detectable. In addition, noAg signalwas detected in Cu6Sn5 accord-
ing to the FE-EPMA analysis. Accordingly, it can be concluded that
Ag was not directly involved in the interfacial reaction.
The Cu6Sn5 microstructures after a single reﬂow for different
solder compositions are shown in Fig. 2(a)–(d). The compound
exhibited the classical scallop-type microstructure. This scallop-
type microstructure is typical from the reaction between Cu and
molten Sn-based solder. These scallops would transform into a
continuous, layered morphology after solid-state aging [14–16].
Fig. 2(a)–(d) shows that the total volume of Cu6Sn5 did not vary
strongly upon theCu content of the solder but the size of theCu6Sn5
scallops did increase with the Cu content. For the other solder ball
sizes (400, 500, and 960m), the trend was the same, and those
results are omitted for the sake of brevity. The reason for this size-
dependence on the initial Cu concentrationwill be discussed in the
Discussion section.

microstructures after one reﬂow for different solder compositions.

shown in Fig. 6(a),when the solder ballwas 760m, theﬁrst reﬂow
cycle consumed most Cu, but subsequent reﬂow cycles only con-
sumed relatively less Cu. As will be discussed later, only part of the
consumed Cu was converted into the Cu6Sn5 scallops, and the rest
of the consumed Cu was dissolved into the molten solder, raising
the Cu concentration to the point of saturation. In this study, the
saturationwas deﬁned as themaximum amount of copper that can
be dissolved in the liquid solder without precipitation of Cu6Sn5. In
other words, the saturation limit was related to the liquidus con-
centration of Cu–Sn binary if the role of Ag is ignored. It should be
noted that the saturation limit is a strong function of temperature,
as is apparent from the Cu–Sn binary phase diagram. This explains
why thesecondandhigher reﬂowsonlyconsumedmarginallymore
Cu (between 0.3 and 0.5m for each additional reﬂow). As shown
in Fig. 6(a), the amount of Cu consumed depended strongly on the
initial Cu concentration in solder, e.g. 10m for Sn3Ag after ﬁve
reﬂow cycles and about half the value for Sn3Ag0.7Cu. The effect
of ball size on the consumed Cu thickness is shown in Fig. 6(b). In
general, a large solder ball consumedmore Cu than its counterpart
with a smaller diameter. In fact, the largest ball (960m)consumed
more than twice the amount of Cu than the smallest ball (400m)
after ﬁve reﬂows. This trend can be understood by the fact that, for
a larger solder volume,more Cu atomswere needed to saturate the
molten solder.
4. Discussions
In this study, the effects of three parameters, initial Cu
concentration in the solder, number of reﬂow cycles, and the sol-
der volume, on the Cu dissolution behaviors were investigated.
Fig. 6. (a) Accumulated thickness of the consumed Cu for 760mballs plotted ver-
sus the number of reﬂow. (b) Accumulated thickness of the consumed Cu after ﬁve
reﬂows plotted versus the solder ball diameter.
Although the type of reaction product (Cu6Sn5) did not change
with these three parameters, those three parameters did have their
impacts on the Cu dissolution rate. Among these three parameters,
the Cu content is the most complicated one and deserves some
discussion before presenting other arguments.
The reason the initial Cu concentration being a complicated fac-
tor was because the Cu concentration in the solder did not stay
constant during the reﬂow process. As the Cu soldering pad was
consumed, the Cu atoms from the pad could either become Cu6Sn5
scallops or dissolve into the molten solder. Accordingly, the Cu
concentration deviated away from its initial value. The Cu concen-
tration can be estimated from the mass balance consideration for
the Cu atoms. We deﬁne the apparent Cu concentration wCu (in
wt.%) as the total amount of the Cu atoms in the solder divided by
the solder volume. These Cu atoms do not include those Cu atoms
incorporated into the Cu6Sn5 scallops attached to the interface, but
do include those from the Cu6Sn5 islands located inside the solder.
With this deﬁnition, from the mass balance of Cu, one obtains the
following equation:

1.2wt.% and TIMC = 2.5m (band lower limit) and wCu = 1.2 wt.% and TIMC = 5m
(band upper limit) for various djoint/dpad combinations.
With some simpliﬁcations, the results obtained in this study can
be used to predict the Cu consumed for real solder joints of various
sizes. Noting that wCu in Eq. (2) did not changemuch among differ-
ent solders anddifferentnumbersof reﬂow(Fig. 7),we take its value
as 1.2wt.% in the following discussion. Also noting that TIMC in Eq.
(2)was in the rangebetween2.5 and5m(Fig. 5), one can calculate
the bands of TCu for various combinations of w0Cu–djoint–dpad. The
lower limits and upper limits of the bandswere calculated by using
TIMC =2.5 and TIMC =5m, respectively. The results are plotted in
Fig. 8 for several commonly encountered djoint/dpad combinations
in electronic assemblies. Fig. 8 empirically predicts the consumed
Cu thickness during a typical reﬂow for real solder joints. Such
consumption rate information is crucial for designing Cu conduc-
tion traces with the minimum but reliable dimensions. It should
be noted that Fig. 8 is applicable to reﬂows with peak temperature
near 235 ◦C, because wCu in Eq. (2) depends on temperature.
5. Summary
For all the experimental conditions (Sn3Ag–Sn3Ag0.7Cu,
400–960msolder balls, and 1–5 reﬂow cycles) used in this study,
only Cu6Sn5, with the classical scallop-type morphology, formed
at the interface. The scallop sizes increased with increasing the ini-
tial Cu concentration, increasing the number of reﬂow cycles, and
decreasing the solder volume.
The consumed thickness of the Cu soldering pads increasedwith
decreasing the initial Cu concentration and increasing the soldering
volume. The ﬁrst reﬂow consumed the most Cu (3–9m, depend-
ing on the initial Cu concentration and the solder volume), and the
solder became saturated with Cu. Because of this saturation after
the ﬁrst reﬂow, subsequent reﬂows only consumed Cu marginally.
An empirical equation, which correlates the ball diameter, pad
diameter, and the initial Cu concentration, with the consumed Cu
thickness, is proposed. This equation can help in designing the Cu
conduction traces with the minimum but reliable dimensions.

inside the solders. They are different due to two reasons (1) part of
the Cu padwas consumed and Cu atoms from this source dissolved
into the solder, and (2) some of the Cu atoms originally in the solder
were incorporated into the two intermetallics at the interface. The
estimated Cu concentrations inside the solders (“the apparent Cu
concentrations”) are given in Table 1. The method for estimating
the apparent Cu concentrations will be presented later. In all cases
at 500h, two intermetallic compounds, Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn, formed,
and no microvoid was observed within Cu3Sn.
When aging time reached 1000h, microvoids were observed in
Cu3Sn for the solder joints with their original Cu compositions that
were 0.2wt.% and lower, as shown in Fig. 3(a)–(l). Microvoids were
observed in Fig. 3(a)–(e), and void was not observed in Fig. 3(f)–(l).

Cu3Sn for the solder joints with their original Cu concentrations
that were 0.25wt.% and lower, as shown in Fig. 4(a)–(l). Microvoids
were observed in Fig. 4(a)–(f), and void was not observed in
Fig. 4(g)–(l). The apparent Cu concentrations inside solder for sol-
der joints shown in Figs. 3 and 4 are given in Table 1. Also included
in Table 1 are remarks noting whether microvoids were observed
or not. The zoom-inmicrographs for Fig. 4(a)–(f) are shown in Fig. 5.
As can be seen in Fig. 4, these microvoids formed not only within
Cu3Sn but also along the Cu3Sn/Cu interface. In fact, voids along the
Cu3Sn/Cu interface almost coalesced into continuous gaps at cer-
tain locations. The formation ofmicrovoids raises serious reliability
concerns because excessive voids formation increases the potential
for brittle interfacial fracture [14–16].
In order to observe the microvoids in a more damage-free
state, cross-sections were also carried out by using FIB for some
of the solder joints, as shown in Fig. 6. Those FIB processed cross-
sections conﬁrm that those voids shown in Figs. 3–5 are not
defects induced during mechanical polishing. Instead, they are

a b s t r a c t
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technique is used to ﬁgure out the growth mechanism of Cu3Sn
in the systems of Cu/Sn and Cu/Sn–Zn where Cu is polycrystalline. After reﬂow in Cu/Sn system, a layer of
equiaxed Cu3Sn grains is already present. During solid-state aging initial equiaxed Cu3Sn grains become
columnar and newly formed equiaxed Cu3Sn grains nucleate at the triple junction sites of the interfaces
between Cu/Cu3Sn and two adjacent Cu3Sn grains. After prolonged aging large columnar and equiaxed
Cu3Sn grains are present with several voids near the Cu side. Sn–0.5wt.%Zn solders are prepared to react
with Cu for comparison. The result shows that Cu3Sn grains in this system are constrained to be equiaxed
without progressive columnar growth after long time aging.

1. Introduction
In modern electronics, Sn-based solder interconnections which
provide electrical, mechanical and physical connections are widely
used. The conducting substrates are commonly made by Cu and
Sn is the major element in Sn-based solders to react with Cu sub-
strates [1,2]. Therefore the chemical reaction between Sn and Cu
is an important issue. There are plenty of studies about the chem-
ical reaction between Cu and Sn-based solders such as pure Sn,
Sn–Ag, Sn–Pb, Sn–Zn, Sn–Bi, Sn–Ag–Cu, Sn–Ag–Bi, etc. [1–23]. In
the above-mentioned systems the two general intermetallic com-
pounds (IMCs), Cu3Sn and Cu6Sn5, may be present. The formation
of these two IMCs is closely related to the mechanical and elec-
trical properties of devices [3,4]. Thus it is necessary to put much
emphasis on these two IMCs.
The growth mechanism transition of Cu6Sn5, form scallop-type
(initialwetting reaction condition) to layer-type (subsequent solid-
state aging condition), has been reported before [5,6]. However, the
growth mechanism of Cu3Sn is rarely concerned because the thick-
ness of Cu3Sn is too thin to be studied in many cases. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) technique provides a good approach
to ﬁgure out the growth mechanism of Cu3Sn phase. Shang et al.
reported thedirectional growthofCu3Snbetweeneutectic SnBi sol-
der and (100) single crystal Cu [7]. The interfacial reaction on Cu
(100) plane resulted in a columnar growthof Cu3Sn alongCu [100]

with a crystallographic relationship. They also pointed out that the
columnar growth and the crystallographic relationship observed in
their study had not been reported before for Cu3Sn. In recent years
studies on correlation between single crystal Cu and Sn-based sol-
ders have already been published [1,7,8]. However, polycrystalline
Cu substrates arewidely used inmodern electronics [1]. Shang et al.
prepared the reactions of eutectic SnBi solder on both single crystal
and polycrystalline Cu substrates later [9]. Since the aggregation of
Bi ﬁne particles at Cu/Cu3Sn interface is possible to inﬂuence the
diffusion behavior between Cu and Cu3Sn [10] and the kinetics of
Cu3Sn growth [2,10], pure Sn used in the present work could serve
as a fundamental to state the growth behavior of Cu3Sn.
Addition of several elements is able to retard the thickness of
IMCs during interfacial reactions between Sn-based solders and
Cu. It is reported that the growth of Cu3Sn would be retarded due
to adding Zn atoms into solders [11,12]. However, the microstruc-
ture observation of the retarded Cu3Sn by TEM is never reported.
In this present work Sn–0.5wt.%Zn solders were also prepared
to react with polycrystalline Cu. The growth of Cu3Sn grains in
Sn–0.5wt.%Zn/Cu system were observed by TEM to compare with
that in pure Sn/Cu system. Thepresentwork is aimed to observe the
growth of Cu3Sn not only in pure Sn/polycrystalline Cu system but
also in Sn–0.5wt.%Zn/polycrystalline Cu system. Both as-reﬂowed
and aged samples were prepared to investigate the microstructure
of Cu3Sn grains during nucleation and growth.
2. Experimental
TEM samples were fabricated as follows. Cu foils (99.9wt.%) were ﬁrstly ground
andpolishedmechanically and thenultrasonically cleaned in ethanol. Afterward the
Cu foils were deoxidized by 5vol.% nitric acid solution and then put on a commer-

samples. Cu3Sn has a crystal structure with orthorhombic unit cell
which constitutes a superstructure to the hexagonal structure [20].
3.2. Columnar growth of initial Cu3Sn layer and newly formed
equiaxed Cu3Sn layer
Fig. 3(a) reveals themicrostructure of the samples aged at 160 ◦C
for 48h. The initial Cu3Sn grains (layer 1) become columnar. More-
over, the newly formed Cu3Sn grains nucleate at the triple point
sites of the interfaces between Cu/Cu3Sn and the two adjacent
Cu3Sn. Such columnar nature indicates that the grain boundary dif-
fusion controls Cu3Sn formation or that there is strong anisotropy
in the growthof Cu3Sn [14]. Grain boundary diffusionwould induce
grain boundary sliding to straighten the wavy grain boundaries
[21]. In the Cu3Sn phase the interdiffusion ﬂuxes of Cu and Sn
are controlled by volume diffusion in the temperature range of
150–225 ◦C [14]. The aging temperature in our study is 160 ◦C and
thus volume diffusion mechanism is suggested to be dominant.
Shang et al. [7] performed their solid-state aging at 393K and
thus the grain boundary diffusion mechanism was suggested to
be dominant in the Cu3Sn phase [14]. Whether volume diffusion
or grain boundary diffusion is dominant, the nature of columnar
growth of Cu3Sn is unchanged. Consequently, it is suggested that
the anisotropy growth of Cu3Sn itself is strongly controlling the
columnar growth of Cu3Sn. Several orientated growth nature of
Cu3Sn has been reported before [20,22].
Large driving force for the formation of Cu3Sn causes the dif-
ﬁculty in nucleation of new Cu3Sn grains. Once nucleated, the
anisotropy growth mechanism of Cu3Sn will start gradually and
the morphology of Cu3Sn is going to be columnar [7]. During solid-
state aging, diffusionﬂux of Cu is higher than that of Sn in the Cu3Sn
phase, that is, Kirkendall effect, and thus excess vacancies would
be left behind in the Cu3Sn phase. The formation of these vacancies
would increase the internal stress which will disturb the balance
of surface tension at the triple point site between Cu/Cu3Sn and
two adjacent Cu3Sn grains. Hence newly formed Cu3Sn grains will
nucleate at this triple point sites to form more grain boundaries
and then release not only internal stress but also excess vacan-
cies. Fig. 3(b) reveals the microstructure of the samples aged at
Fig. 4. The microstructure of the Sn–0.5wt.%Zn/Cu samples reﬂowed at 250 ◦C for
1h and then aged at 160 ◦C for (a) 0h and (b) 750h, respectively. (c) The EDX
spectrum of the Zn-rich layer circled in (b).
160 ◦C for 144h. The shape of newly formed Cu3Sn grains (layer 2)
is equiaxed. Two kinds of Cu3Sn morphology, columnar and nodu-
lar grains, have been observed before by SEM [23]. An alternative
explanation is that triple points were locations with a lower nucle-
ation activation energy than grain boundaries for heterogeneous
nucleation [24].
3.3. Comparison of Cu3Sn morphology between pure Sn/Cu and
Sn–Zn/Cu systems
It iswidely reported that the growth of Cu3Snwould be retarded
when Zn atoms are added into solders [11,12]. The mechanism for
retardation of Cu3Sn growth is suggested that a Zn-rich layer is
located at the interface of Cu/Cu3Sn and this Zn-rich layer is able to
retard the supply of Cu. This result is conﬁrmedexperimentally [12]
and theoretically [25]. Fig. 4(a) reveals the microstructure of the
as-reﬂowed Sn–0.5wt.%Zn/Cu samples (250 ◦C for 1h). Afterwards,
the samples are aged at 160 ◦C for 750h and the microstructure is
shown in Fig. 4(b). A Zn-rich layer which EDX spectrum is shown
M.Y. Tsai et al. / Journal of Alloys and Compounds 494 (2010) 123–127 127
ation of newly formed Cu3Sn grains is suppressed. The percentage
of newly formed equiaxed grains is decreased as shown. Afterward,
voids appear in the Cu3Sn phase especially close to the Cu3Sn/Cu
interface.
4. Summary
Finally it is to summarize all the above results. In the as-reﬂowed
stage (275 ◦C for 90 s), the two IMCs, Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn are present.
Since there is no orientation relationship as long as polycrystalline
Cu is used, non-planar interfaces of Cu/Cu3Sn and Cu3Sn/Cu6Sn5
are present. These two interfaces are believed to inherit non-planar
Cu/Cu6Sn5 interface since Cu6Sn5 is the ﬁrst phase to form in
the Cu–Sn system. The nature of Cu3Sn columnar growth indi-
cates that the grain boundary diffusion controls Cu3Sn formation
or that there is strong anisotropy in the growth of Cu3Sn. Since the
former condition is not conﬁrmed in our study, the latter one is
suggested to be dominant. Newly formed equiaxed Cu3Sn grains
would nucleate at the triple point sites of the interfaces between
Cu/Cu3Sn and the two adjacent Cu3Sn grains to release internal
stress and excess vacancies result fromunbalanced diffusion ﬂuxes
of Cu and Sn atoms in the Cu3Sn phase. The columnar Cu3Sn layer
1 becomes larger and more columnar upon increasing the aging
time, the original equiaxed Cu3Sn layer 2 becomes columnar and
the newly formed equiaxed Cu3Sn layer 3 nucleates and grows
between Cu and Cu3Sn layer 2. The formation of newly formed
equiaxed Cu3Sn at the Cu3Sn/Cu6Sn5 interface is obscure in the
present work especially during long time aging. The growth of
Cu3Sn in Sn–0.5wt.%Zn/Cu system is taken for a comparison. In
this systemequiaxed Cu3Sn grains formduring reﬂowand keep the
same shape after long time aging. The interfacial reaction between
Zn-bearing solders and Cu is able to retard the columnar growth of
Cu3Snwhichmainly contributes to the thickness increase of Cu3Sn.
The thickness increase in this retarded Cu3Sn is attributed to the
grain coarseningof equiaxedgrains.Duringprolongedaging inpure
Sn/Cu systemmany voids are present in the Cu3Sn phase due to the
difﬁculty in the formation of newly formed Cu3Sn grains to release
excess vacancies. The difﬁculty in the formation of newly formed
Cu3Sn grains is due to the shortage of reacting species and that the
formation of Cu3Sn itself becomes unfavorable.

solder were incorporated into the intermetallic(s) at the interface.
The estimated Cu concentration inside the solder after reﬂow or
aging (“the apparent Cu concentration”) is marked (in wt.%) on the
upper-right corner of each micrograph. The method for estimating
the apparent Cu concentration will be presented later. The values
of the apparent Cu concentration and the intermetallics formed at
the interface for different conditions are summarized in Table 1.
The apparent Cu concentrations for the 760, 500, and 300mcases
after reﬂow are 0.68, 0.65, and 0.4wt.%, respectively.
Fig. 2(d)–(f) shows the microstructures of the interfaces after
aging at 160 ◦C for 1000h. For the larger solder joints (760 and
500m), there was still only a (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 layer at the interface,
as shown in Fig. 2(d) and (e). However, for the smallest solder joint
(300m), a layer of (Ni,Cu)3Sn4 had nucleated and grew between
the (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 and Ni, as shown in Fig. 2 (f). The values of the
apparent Cu concentration for the 760, 500, and 300mcases after
aging are 0.67, 0.61, and 0.2wt.%, respectively.
3.2. Sn3Ag0.5Cu spheres
As shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b), for larger solder joints (760
and 500m) after reﬂow, the results for Sn3Ag0.5Cu were similar
to those of Sn3Ag0.7Cu. Only (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 formed at the inter-
face after reﬂow. However, for the smallest solder joint (300m),
(Ni,Cu)3Sn4, instead of (Cu,Ni)6Sn5, formed at the interface after
reﬂow, as shown in Fig. 3(c).
During subsequent aging at 160 ◦C for 1000h, for larger solder
joints (760 and 500m), the results for Sn3Ag0.5Cuwere similar to
those of Sn3Ag0.7Cu, as shown in Fig. 3(d) and (e). Only (Cu,Ni)6Sn5
formed at the interface. For the smallest solder joint (300m), only
a layer of (Ni,Cu)3Sn4 formed at the interface, as shown in Fig. 3(f).
3.3. Sn3Ag0.3Cu spheres
As shown in Fig. 4(a)–(c), when the initial Cu concentration was
0.3wt.%, the reaction product was (Ni,Cu)3Sn4 after reﬂow. This
result is consistentwithprevious reports [2,3] that only (Ni,Cu)3Sn4
formed after reﬂow at the interface as Cu concentration was below
0.4wt.%.
After solid-state aging, only (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 was observed in the
760-m solder sphere, as shown in Fig. 4(d), and the original
(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 that had formedafter reﬂowhaddisappeared. A similar
observationhasbeen reported in the literature [22,23], namely, that
the Ni3Sn4 layer could be converted to (Cu,Ni)6Sn5. The formation
of (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 at such a low Cu concentration seems to be incon-
sistent with the results reported in the literature [2,3], but was in
fact consistent with the prediction of Yu et al. [12]. An explanation
for this will be presented in the Section 4.
In the 500-m solder joint after aging, both (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 and
(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 were formed at the interface, as shown in Fig. 4(e). As
the joint shrunk to 300m, as shown in Fig. 4(f), there was only
(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 at the interface after aging.
4. Discussion
The critical Cu concentration for Sn3.5AgCu as calculated by Yu
et al. [12] is shown by the dashed curve in Fig. 5. The critical Cu con-
centration at each temperature represents the Cu concentration of
the Sn-rich corner of the (Sn) + (Cu6Sn5) + (Ni3Sn4) tie triangle for
the SnCuNi isotherm at that particular temperature, i.e., point O
in Fig. 7 of Ref. [5]. As the compositions of the three vertices in a
typical ternary isotherm are functions of temperature, the critical
Cu concentration also depends on temperature. It is this temper-
ature dependence that gives rise to the dashed curve in Fig. 5.
According to the calculation of Yu et al. [12], the critical Cu concen-
tration decreases with temperature. Also shown in Fig. 5 are data
Fig. 5. The dash curve, calculated by Yu et al. [12], shows the critical Cu con-
centration for Sn3.5AgCu solders as a function of temperature. Solid squares and
hollow diamonds are obtained from the present study, and denote the formation of

points obtained from this study, showing the intermetallic com-
pounds observed at the interface. These data points reveal that the
dashed curve is correct not only in its qualitative trend but also in
its quantitative accuracy. In plotting the data points in Fig. 5, the Cu
concentrations used are the apparent Cu concentrations. The ratio-
nalization for using this apparent concentration and themethod of
estimating this concentration are presented in the following.
As pointed out in our previous studies [18,19], the Cu concen-
tration in solder would decrease with the formation of Cu-bearing
intermetallics, (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 and (Ni,Cu)3Sn4, at the interface. As the
Cu concentration decreases and becomes smaller than the criti-
cal Cu concentration, the stable compound at the interface also
changes. From themass balance of Cu, the total amount of Cu inside
the solder and inside the intermetallic(s) equals the initial amount
of Cu in the solder. From thismass balance consideration,we obtain

represent the diameters (in m) of the solder ball and the opening

the thickness (inm) of the intermetallic compound, with the sub-

depend on the composition of (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 and (Ni,Cu)3Sn4. For

To identify the driving force for the massive spalling phenomenon, carefully designed experiments were carried out. Cu-doped
Sn-rich solder was reacted with Ni to form ﬁrst the Sn–0.6Cu/(Cu,Ni)6Sn5/Ni structure. The original Sn–0.6Cu solder was then
removed and replaced with Sn–0.3Cu or with fresh Sn–0.6Cu. Swapping the solder to Sn–0.3Cu caused massive spalling of
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5. The results of this study unequivocally prove that the massive spalling reported in the literature is caused by a driving
force that is purely thermodynamic in nature.

Keywords: Soldering; Intermetallic compounds
In electronic solder joints, one persistent issue
plaguing the reliability of electronic devices is the massive
spalling of intermetallic compound(s) from the solder–
substrate interface. The term “massive spalling” refers
to the detachment of an intermetallic compound, the reac-
tion product, from the interface on an unusually large
scale. The entire intermetallic compound layer can detach
itself from the interface before disintegrating into individ-
ual intermetallic grains. Massive spalling had been
observed in many solder–substrate systems, including
SnAgCu soldered on Ni substrate [1–3], SnZn on Cu
[4,5], high-Pb PbSn on Cu [6,7], and high-Pb PbSn on
Ni [8].
Recently, a uniﬁed model was proposed to explain
this rather unusual phenomenon [9]. According to this
model, two necessary conditions must be met for the
massive spalling to occur [9]. The ﬁrst condition is that
at least one of the reactive constituents of the solder
must be present in a limited amount, and the second is
that the soldering reaction has to be very sensitive to
the concentrations of the constituents. With the growth
of the intermetallic, more and more constituent atoms
are extracted out of the solder and incorporated into
the intermetallic. As the concentration of this constitu-
ent decreases, the original intermetallic at the interface
becomes a non-equilibrium phase, and massive spalling
of the original intermetallic occurs. While this model can
explain observations previously reported in the litera-
ture [1–8], it had not previously been experimentally ver-
iﬁed. The objective of this study was to test the validity
of this model through experiments that were speciﬁcally
designed for this purpose.
In this study, the reaction between SnCu solder and
Ni substrate was selected as the test system because it
is one of the best-understood solder–substrate reactions
[2,10–13]. In addition, the phase equilibria for the Sn-
rich corner of the Sn–Cu–Ni isotherm at 240 C, shown
in Figure 1a, are known. As pointed out in the literature
[2], this system does exhibit the two necessary conditions
described in the previous paragraph. Two diﬀerent solder
compositions, Sn–0.6Cu and Sn–0.3Cu (wt.%), were pre-
pared from high-purity (99.99%) elements to react with
99.99% Ni substrates. The amount of solder used in each
reaction was relatively large so that the Cu concentration
in solder can be regarded as remaining constant during
the reaction even though the Cu atoms were constantly
extracted out of the solder matrix and became incorpo-
rated into the formed intermetallics [1,2].
The processing steps are summarized in Figure 1b.
The main idea was to test if the massive spalling could
be induced by changing the Cu concentration in solder
from a well-controlled value, where (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 was in
thermodynamic equilibrium with the solder, to another
well-controlled value, where (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 was not in
equilibrium with the replaced solder. In step A, each
Ni substrate was reacted ﬁrst with a fresh molten

thin layer of (Ni,Cu)3Sn4 had formed between (Cu,-
Ni)6Sn5 and Ni. The diﬀraction pattern shown in the in-
set of Figure 3b established the identities of these two
intermetallics. This pattern was obtained after Sn–
0.3Cu had been etched away. The crystal structure of
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 was based on the high-temperature phase
g-Cu6Sn5 [14]. The phase (Ni,Cu)3Sn4 formed because,
according to Figure 1a, it was now the phase in equilib-
rium with the solder with lower Cu concentration. At
this stage, there was a series of voids between (Cu,-
Ni)6Sn5 and (Ni,Cu)3Sn4. The appearance of those voids
was an indication of the early stage of the massive spall-
ing [7]. It took another minute for complete detachment
of the (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 layer to occur, as shown in Figure 3b.
There are two very interesting features that warrant fur-
ther study: (i) (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 detached itself from the inter-
face as a continuous layer, without disintegrating into
individual grains; (ii) the solder had completely ﬁlled
the gap between the two intermetallics even though
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 was still a continuous layer. A step-by-step
dynamic mechanism that is compatible with these two
features has to be devised before one can claim a com-
prehensive understanding of this highly interesting phe-
nomenon. By 3 min, (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 began to show signs of
disintegration or dissolution, as shown in Figure 3c, and
the gap between the two intermetallics widened. By
10 min, as shown in Figure 3d, the (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 had been
completely dissolved, and at the same time (Ni,Cu)3Sn4
had grown much thicker. Further reaction only in-
creased the thickness of (Ni,Cu)3Sn4.
The results presented in Figure 3 unequivocally show
that the proposed model [9] correctly identiﬁes the ther-
modynamic driving force. The massive spalling of an
intermetallic from the interface occurs in order to
accommodate a new phase that becomes stable due to
the composition of the most reactive component in a
solder being changed. In all the literature reporting mas-
sive spalling [1–8], the concentrations of the reactive
constituent in the solder were always diﬃcult to mea-
sure, and could only be estimated. Accordingly, the pro-
posed model has never been fully veriﬁed. In this study,
the exact concentration of the reactive constituent (Cu)
was precisely known, and thus the driving force for mas-
sive spalling could be positively identiﬁed.
During the removal of Sn–0.6Cu (step B), it is possi-
ble that the (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 sustained a certain amount of
damage. To prove that such damage had no bearing
on the massive spalling observed in this study, we also
swapped the original solder with fresh Sn–0.6Cu (step
C2). As shown in Figure 4, there was no indication of
the spalling of (Cu,Ni)6Sn5, which only grew thicker
with reaction time. In this study, despite using reaction
times as long as 2 min after step C2, no spalling was ever
observed.
In summary, the driving force for massive spalling is
indeed purely thermodynamic in nature. It is concluded
that the massive spalling phenomenon should be
regarded as a process through which the interface re-
sponds to the shifting of the equilibrium phase. The
massive spalling occurs because the original reaction
product at the interface is no longer in local thermody-
namic equilibrium with the solder, and this intermetallic
spalls away to make room for the subsequent nucleation
and growth of the new equilibrium phase.

mode studies the sample thickness was further ion
etched to about 30 nm.
Figure 1 is a TEM micrograph showing the interface
region between Cu and the solder quenched from a peak
temperature of 217.4 C. Both Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn were
observed. The Cu3Sn layer was 80–90 nm thick, while
the Cu6Sn5 layer had a scalloped morphology. Even
though the solder was only partially molten at
217.4 C, both Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn had formed. Figure
2 is a diﬀerential scanning calorimetry (DSC) cooling
curve showing two exothermic peaks at 173.2 and
186.2 C, which probably represent the transformation
from g0-Cu6Sn5 to g-Cu6Sn5. Similar thermal analysis
results were reported by Schaefer [10] and Umantsev
[18]. The results suggest that the nucleation of g0-Cu6Sn5
occurred before complete melting of the solder. Thus,
the ﬁndings indicate that g0-Cu6Sn5 nucleates heteroge-
neously and randomly irrespective of site [5,6,8,15,16]
prior to melting. The rapid formation of an e-Cu3Sn
layer (80–90 nm) in partially molten solder suggests that
the rates of nucleation and growth are very high [4,7,8]
in the liquid state. Tin atoms in the molten solder could
penetrate the Cu lattice at the atomic scale [19,20] due to
rapid diﬀusion [9–12]. In addition, Sn atoms preferen-
tially adsorbed to Cu nodules and interacted with solid
Cu atoms [21,22]. This interaction weakened the binding
energy between the attacked Cu atom and the neighbor-
ing Cu lattice. It helped in releasing Cu atoms from the
top surface of the Cu pad. Both Lord et al. [7] and Zur-
uzi et al. [12] reported such phenomenon of IMC
advancement into the Cu substrate. In the early stages
of soldering prior to IMC layer formation Sn assisted
this heterogeneous nucleation.
Figure 3 shows the interfaces between two Cu3Sn
grains and a g-Cu6Sn5 grain. This micrograph corre-
sponds to the region within the white square in Figure
1. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis showed a
Cu-enriched region (spots 3 and 4) at the phase bound-
ary of Cu3Sn and g-Cu6Sn5 (spots 2 and 1, respectively).
Within the Cu-enriched region, the Cu concentration
was 80.3–84.5 at.%, higher than that of Cu3Sn. The
thickness of this region was about 4–6 nm. Such a thick
interphase interface was rather unusual. Part of the rea-
son for this thick interface is likely the very large lattice
mismatch between Cu3Sn and a g-Cu6Sn5 [23]. The Cu
atoms within the Cu-enriched region came from the Cu
substrate by interphase boundary diﬀusion. These
Cu-enriched regions provided a fast diﬀusion channel
for Cu diﬀusion during the reaction between Cu and Sn.
Figure 4 is a HR-TEM micrograph of the interface
between the Sn4Ag0.5Cu solder and g-Cu6Sn5. Table
1 presents the respective EDX spots taken from this
micrograph. The Sn4.0Ag0.5Cu solder consisted of crys-
talline (spots 2 and 3) and amorphous (spot 1) regions.
The amorphous region was similar to the ﬁndings of
Pan et al. [15] and Yu et al. [6]. The diﬀerent lattice
orientations of g-Cu6Sn5 and Sn4Ag0.5Cu are indicated
by the arrows. At the interface between the solder and
g-Cu6Sn5 there is a 3–5 nm thick Cu-enriched region
(spots 4 and 6–8). This Cu-enriched region was presum-
ably connected from the Cu substrate to the Cu3Sn and
then to g-Cu6Sn5 before dissolving in the solder matrix.
The EDX spot 5 in Figure 4 shows a Cu/Sn atomic ratio
of 1.19, which corresponds to Cu6Sn5.

This letter reports a RuNx-bearing Cu layer that has the potential to replace both thewetting layer and the
diffusion barrier layer in the conventional under bumpmetallurgy of ﬂip-chip solder joints. This Cu–RuNx
composite layer was deposited by reactive co-sputtering of Cu and Ru in N2 atmosphere. Experimental
characterizations show that Cu–RuNx exhibits comparable solderability to pure Cu. Most importantly,
Cu–RuNx has a dissolution rate at least one order of magnitude slower than that of pure Cu. A single layer
exhibiting these two attributes might offer substantial advantage in cost reduction.

The under bump metallurgy (UBM) of a ﬂip-chip solder joint
serves the key role of establishing a highly reliable linkage between
the Si chip and the solder bump. The UBM has to exhibit both
proper solderability and sufﬁcient barrier capability against sol-
dering reaction. To meet these two requirements, UBM typically
consists of several metal layers, including one metal layer, such as
Cu, for solderability (wetting layer), and another layer, such as Ni,
for resistance against excessive soldering reaction (barrier layer)
[1,2]. An inner adhesion layer, such as Ti, is also commonly used.
Such a multi-layer stack inevitably raises cost, and there is a need
to reduce the number of layers to a minimum. In other words, it is
desirable to ﬁnd a metal layer that can serve more than one func-
tions. In this letter, an advanced RuNx-bearing Cu layer that has the
potential to replace both the wetting layer and the barrier layer is
reported.
The detailed procedure for preparing the composite layer of Cu
and RuNx had been reported elsewhere [3], and is omitted here.
The Cu–RuNx composite layer was prepared by co-sputtering Cu
(99.999% pure) and Ru (99.99%) targets on (100) Si wafer in the
atmosphere of Ar–10% N2 mixture gas. The overall composition of
theﬁlmwasdetermined to be0.4 at.% Ru and1.7 at.%N (balanceCu)
byusing secondary ionmass spectroscopy [3]. Brightﬁeld transmis-
sion electronmicroscopy analysis [3] showed that the Cumatrix in
the Cu–RuNx composite layer exhibited a columnar structure with

an average10nmcrystallite size (see Fig. 4 of Ref. [3]). X-raydiffrac-
tion analysis showed that Ru had reacted with N2 to form a RuNx
compound [3,4].
In addition to this Cu–RuNx composite layer, experiments were
also carried out by using electroplated Cu layer for comparison.
For the solderability evaluation, three types of solders, Sn–37Pb,
Sn–9Zn and Sn–3Ag–0.5Cu (wt.%) were selected. The solderabil-
ity was evaluated by measuring the spreading areas of each solder
over the Cu–RuNx composite layer and the electroplated Cu layer.
The solder spheres were allowed to spread over the substrates for
20 s at 240 ◦C,which is a typical peak reﬂow temperature employed
by industry. In this study, the spreading of solder was uniform in
all directions, producing spherical capmorphology. Such a uniform
spreading is critical to generate reproducible reading of the spread-
ing area. Our experience is that if the substrates are clean, ﬂat, and,
most importantly, relatively oxide-free, then the spreading will be
quite uniform. Excessive oxide on the substrate is the number one
reason for non-uniform spreading. For evaluation on the soldering
reaction, the sessile drop method was used. Solder balls of 760m
in diameter and Sn–3Ag–0.5Cu in composition were placed onto
the Cu–RuNx or Cu substrates, and kept at a constant temperature
of 240 ◦C for different periods of time. The thickness of thedissolved
Cu–RuNx substrate or Cu substrate was determined by measuring
the vertical distance between the substrate surface that was cov-
ered by solder and the surface thatwas not covered by solder of the
same specimen.
The spreading ratios of the solders on pure Cu and Cu–RuNx
substrates are shown in Fig. 1. The spreading ratio is deﬁned as the

tion product was observed. In addition, no gap between the solder
and Cu–RuNx was observed. It was always possible that a certain
reaction product existed but was simply too thin to be resolved by
the ﬁeld emission scanning electronmicroscope used in this study.
Under this situation, the thin reaction product provided the adhe-
sionbetween the solder andCu–RuNx. A secondpossibilitywas that
the reaction product indeed did not form. Under this situation, the
adhesion between the solder and Cu–RuNx was provided by the
direct metallic bonds between the solder and Cu–RuNx.
The consumption rate of Cu–RuNx was also very low during
high temperature aging process. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the thick-
ness Cu–RuNx remained almost unchanged even after 1000h at
200 ◦C. A resulting interfacial image after 1000h aging is shown in
Fig. 5(b). The Cu–RuNx layer remained stable, and no intermetal-
lic compound was observed at the interface. It is quite surprising
that no reaction product was observed even after such a long
period of thermal aging. Moreover, the adhesion between solder
and the Cu–RuNx layer remained excellent. As had been pointed
out in a previous study [3], the Cu–RuNx ﬁlm had an excel-
lent thermal stability and adhesion to Si, having the capability
of withstanding 680 ◦C annealing for at least 1h. This seems to
suggest that the Cu–RuNx ﬁlm is an inherently very stable mate-
rial. There is no previous report in literature that ally addition
to Cu of a few atomic percent is able to completely inhibit the
formation of any intermetallic compound at the interface. The
exact mechanism for this behaviour is unclear at this moment,
and more detailed study is required to resolve this rather novel
phenomenon.
In summary, it was demonstrated that the sputter-deposited
Cu–RuNx layer exhibited a very low reactivity with either molten
solder or solid solder. The dissolution rate of this layer is as low as
that of Ni. No intermetallic compound was observed at the inter-
face with the solder even after long period of solid state aging at
200 ◦C. In addition, Cu–RuNx exhibits adequate wetting to solder
and has solderability comparable to pure Cu. A single metallisa-
tion layer simultaneously exhibiting these two properties has the
potential to replace both the wetting layer and the barrier layer,
and offers substantial advantage in cost reduction. Uncovering the
mechanism for its low reactivity to solders and evaluating the joint
strength are two areas that need further investigation.

brevity. When the reaction time reached 240min (Fig. 3), only
Ni3Sn2 formed, andNi3Snwasnotobserved. Therewereagainvoids
and high-Pb phase (Pb) between Ni3Sn and Ni, but the amount of
voids and high-Pb phase (Pb) were less than those of 95Pb5Sn and
97Pb3Sn. In fact, a trend can be observed in Figs. 1(c), 2(c), and 3
that the amount of voids (Pb) decreased with decreasing Sn con-
centration in solders.
4. Discussion
During the soldering reaction, the Sn atoms in solder reacted
with Ni to form Ni–Sn intermetallics at the interface. If the amount
of solder had been small, as in ﬂip–chip solder joints, the Sn con-
centration in solder would have decreased as Ni–Sn intermetallics
grew thicker. Nevertheless, in this study, the amount of solder was
purposely set to be very large (12g) compared to the amount of
Ni–Sn intermetallics formed at the interface. Consequently, the Sn
concentration in solder stayed nearly constant. This was done so
that the Sn concentration effect can be clariﬁed in this study ﬁrst.
Only after establishing the concentration effect, could one begin to
investigate the volume effect. However, it should be emphasized
that the results obtained in this study should only be used to inter-
pret to results in real ﬂip chip joints with an understanding of the
volume effect.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
The Ni/95Pb-5Sn/Cu diffusion couples were pre-
pared by electroplating a 95Pb-5Sn layer (100 lm or
400 lm) and then a Ni layer (20 lm) over Cu foil
substrates. A schematic drawing of the sample
structure is shown in Fig. 1. The Cu foil was 400 lm
thick and 99.6 wt.% pure. Before electroplating,
each Cu foil surface was polished, with 1 lm dia-
mond abrasive used in the last polishing step. The
Cu foil was then lightly etched in 5 vol.% HNO3-
CH3OH solution for 1 min and cleaned with deion-
ized water.
After electroplating, the foils were cut into
10 mm 9 10 mm diffusion couples. The samples

previous studies, microvoids were also reported to
form at the reaction of the lead-free, 37Pb-63Sn, and
composites solder.10,20–22 When aging was carried
out at 250C, as shown in Fig. 3c, on the Ni side
there were two intermetallic compounds: a Ni–Sn
compound and (Cu0.6Ni0.4)6Sn5 formed at the
original 95Pb-5Sn/Ni interface. It is interesting
to note that the Cu atoms from the Cu side were
able to diffuse across the 95Pb-5Sn layer to form
(Cu0.6Ni0.4)6Sn5 on the Ni side. On the Cu side, a
lot of the intermetallics compounds (Cu3Sn) had
spalled from the interface, as shown in Fig. 3d. More
discussion about this spalling will be presented
later. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that the
spalling phenomenon could occur even though the
diffusion couples experienced no reflow.
Subsequent aging did not change the types of the
reaction products or their morphologies on the Ni
side. As shown in Fig. 4a, after aging at 175C for
2000 h, a layer of Ni3Sn4 formed. For the case of
250C, as shown in Fig. 4b, (Cu0.4Ni0.6)6Sn5 and
Ni3Sn4 formed. The growth kinetics for Ni3Sn4 and
(Cu0.4Ni0.6)6Sn5 at other time and temperatures are
shown in Fig. 5.
Subsequent aging did not change the types of the
reaction products on the Cu side, but the Cu3Sn
morphology underwent very interesting develop-
ment. Figure 6 shows the microstructure evolution
for the 100 lm diffusion couple during aging at
175C to 250C for 500 h to 2000 h. Figure 6a1–d1
shows the gradual development of the massive
spalling of the Cu3Sn layer. The spalling started
from the congregation of microvoids in Cu3Sn, as
shown in Fig. 6a1–b1. The Pb-rich phase migrated

Interaction Between Ni and Cu Across 95Pb-5Sn High-Lead Layer 2665
As pointed out previously, the Sn concentration in
the solder did not stay constant during aging. The
Sn atoms could be incorporated into Cu3Sn, Ni3Sn4
or Cu6Sn5. Accordingly, the Sn concentration devi-
ated from its initial value. The Sn concentration can
be estimated from the mass balance consideration
for Sn. We define the residual Sn concentration wSn
(in wt.%) as the total amount of Sn atoms in the
solder divided by the solder volume. With this defi-
nition, one obtains the following equation:
dsolder  qsolder  wSn
¼ dsolder  qsolder  w0Sn 
X
IMC
dIMC  qIMC  wSn=IMC;
(1)
where wSn
0 and wSn/IMC represent the initial Sn con-
centration in the solder and the Sn concentration
in Cu3Sn, Cu6Sn5 or Ni3Sn4 (all in wt.%), respec-
tively; dsolder and dIMC represent the thickness of
the solder and the thickness of Cu3Sn, Cu6Sn5 or
Ni3Sn4, respectively (Fig. 1); qsolder and qIMC repre-
sent the density of high-lead solder, and interme-
tallic compounds, respectively. The densities of
Cu3Sn, Cu6Sn5, Ni3Sn4, and Pb-5Sn can be taken as
9 g/cm3, 8.28 g/cm3, 8.64 g/cm3, and 10.8 g/cm3,
respectively.26 The values of wSn/Cu3Sn, wSn/Cu6Sn5,
and wSn/Ni3Sn4 are 38.3 wt.%, 60.9 wt.%, and
72.9 wt.% according to the Cu3Sn, Cu6Sn5, and
Ni3Sn4 formulae, respectively. With these material
properties applied to Eq. 1, one obtains the residual
Sn concentration in solder as

Effects of Ni Additions on the Growth of Cu3Sn in High-Lead
Solders

In reactions between solders and Cu, additions of minor alloying elements,
such as Fe, Co or Ni, to solders often reduce the Cu3Sn growth rate. Never-
theless, the mechanism for this effect remains unresolved. To provide more
experimental observations that are essential for uncovering this mechanism,
growth of Cu3Sn in the reaction between Cu and high-lead solders with or
without Ni additions has been studied. The solders used for this study were
10Sn-90Pb and 5Sn-95Pb doped with 0 wt.%, 0.03 wt.%, 0.06 wt.%, 0.1 wt.%
or 0.2 wt.% Ni. Reaction conditions included one reflow at 350C for 2 min and
solid-state aging at 160C for up to 2000 h. The effect of Ni on the growth of
Cu3Sn is discussed in detail based on the experimental results.
Key words: Solder, soldering, high-lead, microvoids
INTRODUCTION
A critical issue affecting solder joint reliability is
microvoids within Cu3Sn. A large amount of voids is
known to degrade the mechanical properties of sol-
der joints. One approach to eliminate such micro-
voids is through minor alloying additions. Many
alloying elements have been investigated, including
Fe,1 Co,1,2 Ni,2–10 Zn,9,11–14 and rare-earth ele-
ments.15 The element Ni has been the most widely
investigated to date, and all such studies consis-
tently point out that Ni is able to substantially
reduce the growth rate of Cu3Sn.
2–10 Nevertheless,
the mechanism responsible for this Cu3Sn growth
retardation remains unresolved, despite the fact
that several theories have been proposed, including
thermodynamic10 and kinetic arguments.16–18
In the reaction between Cu and 63Sn-37Pb (wt.%,
here and hereafter) solder, as well as most Sn-based
lead-free solders, both Cu6Sn5 (g) and Cu3Sn (e)
grow. This simultaneous growth of two compounds
makes it difficult to identify the mechanism
responsible for the reduced Cu3Sn growth rate.
However, as shown by the Cu-Sn-Pb isotherms
(Fig. 1),19 only Cu3Sn will grow if the Pb content in
the solder is high enough (>45 wt.% Pb at 350C,
>94 wt.% at 170C). This provides an opportunity
to examine whether additions of Ni can still reduce
the Cu3Sn growth rate when only Cu3Sn forms. If
the Cu3Sn growth rate is also reduced under the
situation when no Cu6Sn5 forms, the reduced
growth rate can be attributed to the effect of Ni on
the Cu3Sn compound itself. On the other hand, if
the growth rate of Cu3Sn is not reduced under the
situation when no Cu6Sn5 forms, the reason for the
reduced growth rate can be attributed to the effect
of Ni on Cu6Sn5.
In this study, 10Sn-90Pb and 5Sn-95Pb solders
doped with different levels of Ni (0 wt.% to
0.2 wt.%) were reacted with Cu substrates. The
350C isotherm shown in Fig. 1a predicts that, at
this temperature, only Cu3Sn forms for both 10Sn-
90Pb and 5Sn-95Pb. Nevertheless, the 170C iso-
therm shown in Fig. 1b indicates that both Cu6Sn5
and Cu3Sn might form when 10Sn-90Pb is used, and
only Cu3Sn forms when 5Sn-95Pb is used. The key
observation in this study is whether the thickness of
Cu3Sn can be reduced by Ni additions under these
situations.

bath at 350C for 2 min. When the reaction time
was reached, the solder bath together with the Cu
disk was cooled to room temperature using an air
blower. The solder joints then went through solid-
state aging at 160C for 500 h, 1000 h, or 2000 h.
Samples were then mounted in epoxy, sectioned
using a low-speed diamond saw, and metallurgically
polished in preparation for characterization. The
reaction zone for each sample was examined using
an optical microscope and a scanning electron
microscope (SEM). Some cross-sections were cre-
ated by using a focused ion beam (FIB) to obtain
relatively damage-free cross-sections. The composi-
tions of the reaction products were determined
using a field-emission electron probe microanalyzer
(FE-EPMA).
RESULTS
Reaction During Reflow
Figure 2a–e shows backscattered electron micro-
graphs for 10Sn-90Pb with different Ni additions
that were reflowed at 350C for 2 min. The corre-
sponding micrographs for 5Sn-95Pb with different
Ni additions are shown in Fig. 2f–j. In all cases in
Fig. 2, Cu3Sn was the only compound observed,
whereas Cu6Sn5 was not observed. These phenom-
ena can be understood according to the Cu-Sn-Pb
350C isotherm (Fig. 1a). As can be seen in Fig. 2,
Ni additions had no effect on the Cu3Sn morphology,
which was layer type. This is very different from the
reaction between Cu and Ni-doped lead-free solder,
where additions of Ni changed the Cu6Sn5 mor-
phology from layer type to dense needle type.2–10
Reaction During Aging
Backscattered electron micrographs of the results
of reactions between Ni-doped 10Sn-90Pb solders
and Cu at 160C are shown in Fig. 3. Before aging,
the solder joints went through a 2-min reflow at
350C during assembly. Both Cu3Sn and Cu6Sn5
were observed. The reactions between Ni-doped 5Sn-
90Pb solders and Cu at 160C are shown in Fig. 4.

different from the 170C isotherm shown in Fig. 1b.
In short, one can use Fig. 1b as a guide in inter-
preting the results obtained in this study.
As shown in Fig. 3a, in 10Sn-90Pb solder joints,
Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn compounds both displayed a
layer-type morphology. Ni additions had no effect on
the growth of Cu3Sn. In addition, some microvoids
are observable within Cu3Sn after aging for time
exceeding 1000 h, as shown in Fig. 3. As shown in
Fig. 4, when only Cu3Sn formed, Ni additions
still had no effect on the growth of Cu3Sn. Again,
microvoids within Cu3Sn after 1000 h aging are
observed.
The thickness of Cu3Sn measured from Figs. 3
and 4 is plotted as a function of Ni composition in
Fig. 5a and b for 10Sn-90Pb and 5Sn-95Pb, respec-
tively. As can be seen in Fig. 5, additions of Ni not
only could not reduce the growth of Cu3Sn but in
fact slightly increased its thickness.
The compositions of Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn
after aging at 160C for 500 h, as determined
by FE-EPMA, are summarized in Table I. The
