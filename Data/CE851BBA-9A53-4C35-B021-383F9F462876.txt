survey research with the systematic sampling technique, in-depth case research, factorial 
experiments, the explanation building technique, and the function analysis system technique. 
Collectively, while contributing new theory and empirical insight with solid experiment 
evidence and relevancy, we will provide solution approaches for the research questions. 
Consequently, the predictions of future net operating CFs will be more accurate and reliable, 
leading to a better performance of the net operating working capital of firms that ultimately 
enhances the firms’ profitability. 
 
???? 
1.1.  Motivation of this research 
The construction industry has one of the highest failure rates of any industry (Jackson 
and Gilliam, 1999). Many bankruptcies occur not because of a lack of profits but because of a 
lack of cash. A company can survive a transitional period without showing a profit, or even 
with a loss, but it may collapse due to a lack of cash even if it has a very positive income 
balance (Peer and Rosental, 1982). Kirkpatrick (1994) notes that without future operating 
cash-flow (CF) projections, accurate and reliable estimates of the many variable factors of a 
project cannot be made. Knowing when cash outlays will occur enables businesses to plan 
accordingly and protect themselves from having to borrow on short notice to satisfy cash 
requirements (Sidford, 1997). Consequently, a robust operating CF forecasting and control 
system is an indispensable tool for the construction industry.  
Currently, there exist a great volume of approaches and methods for projecting future 
operating CFs (e.g., ????, 1995, 1995, 1998; ???, 1992; Abudayyeh and Rasdorf, 
1993; Ashley and Teicholz, 1977; Barth et al., 2001; Bernard and Stober 1989; Bowen et al., 
1986; Carr, 1993; Dechow et al., 1998; Hwee and Tiogn, 2002; Kaka, 1996; Kaka and Lewis, 
2003; Kaka and Price, 1993; Kenley and Wilson, 1986, 1989; Navon, 1995; Peer, 1982). The 
detail of these models varies wildly with purpose, approach, and assumptions about 
information availability. For instance, Bowen et al. (1986) predicts annual operating CFs one 
and two years into the future, using a set of variables that include net income, depreciation, 
working capital from operations, and past values of operating CFs. Navon (1995, 1996) 
introduces a computerized system that employs cost and schedule information to produce CFs 
when a high level of detail is available while relying on a model based approach for projects 
with limited available information. Kaka and Lewis (2003) presents a computerized system 
that creates future operating CFs with a cost S-curve profile mechanism which determines the 
S-curve profile by automatically selecting one from the library of previously developed, 
taking an average S-curve from similar past projects, or fitting of a curve from four or more 
points specified by the user.  
Among models and approaches reviewed, the most information-intensive models to 
predict operating CFs are those based on cost-schedule integration (CSI) techniques (e.g., 
Abudayyeh and Rasdorf, 1993; Carr, 1993; Chen, 2002; Fayek, 2001; Navon, 1996). While 
these models make use of extensive schedule and estimated data information as future inputs 
to provide highly integrated models for predicting future operating CFs, these models have 
overwhelmingly focused on improving the accuracy of cost flow predictions. This focus 
ignores the fact that operating CFs are a conglomeration of sales revenues (sales flows) and 
operating expenses (cost flows) that includes cost of goods sold, payments for salaries, 
utilities, tax, interest, etc. For example, Reinschmidt and Frank (1976) attempted to increase 
the accuracy of operating CFs by enhancing the accuracy of cost flow predictions through 
considering schedule and cost uncertainty by assigning predetermined probabilities to each 
cost account and construction schedule. Abudayyeh and Rasdorf (1991, 1993) attempted to 
 4
Singh and Woon, 1984). The accounting-based models are created based on the historical data 
of the income statement and the comparative balance sheet (used to compile past values of 
CFs) in conjunction with statistical methods. These models are mostly univariate or 
multivariate, time-series prediction models and are constructed principally on the 
relationships of current operating CFs, past values of operating CFs, earrings, and accounting 
accruals.  
For example, Bowen et al. (1986) forecasted annual operating CFs one and two years 
into the future, using a set of variables that include net income, depreciation, working capital 
from operations, and past values of operating CF. Lorek et al. (1993) built univariate 
autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models for quarterly operating CF 
predictions. They proposed two common structure ARIMA models for future operating CFs, 
in which all sample firms utilize the identical model structure, while the parameters are 
estimated on a firm-specific basis. Concurrently, McBeth (1993) examined the predictive 
ability of net income and operating CFs, based upon simple regression models in a pooled 
cross-sectional and limited intertemporal setting, and concluded that both of them are equally 
accurate predictors of annual operating CF. He proposed a multivariate regression model of 
future operating CF and encouraged continued research in this area.  
Lorek and Willinger (1996) developed a multivariate time-series prediction model that 
employs lagged values of operating CF before depreciation, operating CF, accounts receivable, 
inventories and accounts receivable. Their model possesses two distinguishing characteristics: 
First, their model allows firm-specific parameter estimation. Second, the model incorporates a 
parsimonious set of accrual accounting variables in addition to past values of the operating CF 
series in comparison to the previous multivariate time-series models (e.g., Bernard and Stober 
1989; Lorek et al., 1993; McBeth, 1993; Wilson, 1986, 1987).  
Building from this work, Dechow et al. (1998) modeled operating CF and the formal 
accounting process related to accounts receivable, accounts payable, and inventory. They 
tested the predictive ability of the model on a sample of 1337 firms’ annual financial data 
from 1963 to 1992. They concluded that in firm-specific regression of future operating CF on 
current aggregate operating CF and earnings, both of them have incremental explanatory 
power. Barth et al. (2001) further extended the work of Dechow et al. (1998) by including 
more predictor variables, i.e., depreciation of fixed assets, amortization of intangibles, and 
multiple lags of earnings and CF. They disaggregated earnings into its CF and various accrual 
components, permitted to have different coefficients in the prediction equation, and claimed 
that by doing so it significantly enhances the predictive ability of the model. More recently, 
researchers (e.g., Nikkinen and Sahlstrom, 2004) investigate the impact of an accounting 
environment on the performance of operating CF prediction models.  
The second group of predicting future operating CFs is the project-based models that 
focus on the project’s contracts rather than the firm’s income statement and balance sheet, 
because the contracts determine both the timing and amount of the cash inflows and outflows. 
The contracts specify when and under what conditions the customer has to pay, and the 
vendors have to be paid. Those conditions determine the pattern of future cash receipts and 
disbursements and so the contracts are more primitive than the firm’s financial statements.  
As with the previous studies of the accounting-based models, one group of the 
project-based models’ authors use historical data to forecast future operating CFs. Standard 
curve models, based on historical data to formulate the relationship between project 
cumulative cost (sales) and construction time in percentage, have been largely utilized in 
operating CF research (e.g., Bromilow, 1978; Drake, 1978; Gates and Scarpa, 1979; Hwee 
and Tiogn, 2002; Kaka, 1996; Kaka and Lewis, 2003; Kaka and Price, 1993; Kenley and 
Wilson, 1986, 1989; Peer, 1982; Singh and Woon, 1984). Peer (1982) used polynomial 
regression analysis and historical data of four projects to formulate a standard curve for 
 6
with a range of two parameters ? and ? that is capable of simulating cash flow profiles. 
Kaka and Lewis (2003) developed a company-level cash flow model based on predetermined 
parameters ? and ? of S-curves which are created with grouped historical projects. Lorek 
and Willinger (1996) developed a multivariate time-series operating CF prediction model that 
employs past values of operating CF and accounting accruals. Nevertheless, modern scientific 
thought has rejected past observations of empirical phenomena as a sufficient predictor for 
forecasting future phenomena in the absence of a universal theory or law (Proper, 1983). Even 
where a theory or law is available, the future output of a model which utilizes that theory or 
law is indeterminate without knowledge of the future input to the model (McBeth, 1993).  
Among models and approaches reviewed, the most detailed models which incorporate 
future inputs to produce operating CFs are those based on the CSI approach (Sears 1981). 
These models make use of extensive forecast work schedules and activities as future inputs to 
provide highly integrated models for future operating CFs that are accurate within their 
assumptions. Nonetheless, in spite of the panoply of models and approaches, the authors have 
primarily focused on the improvement of operating cost flow forecasts (e.g., ????, 1998; 
Abudayyeh and Rasdorf, 1993; Carr, 1993; Chen, 2002; Fayek, 2001; Navon, 1996). 
Relatively little research has been performed to increase the accuracy of operating CFs by 
enhancing the accuracy of operating sales flow forecasts. For example, Navon (1995, 1996, 
1997) developed a computer model based on CSI that takes into account monthly progress 
payments, time lags between application for payment and disbursement, variations in time 
lags between vendors, and inflation. On the contrary, Navon’s model simply predicts future 
sales flows by the volume of cost flows in the corresponding period that adds a predetermined 
mark-up in the contract, leaving potentially influential variables out of account. These 
variables include project owners’ payment conditions and payment irregularity. Furthermore, 
his model is also incapable of updating and readjusting sales flow forecasts after each 
payment is received from the project owner due to the lack of progressive construction data 
feedback mechanisms.  
Subsequent work of ???? (1998) constructed a computer CF model on the basis of 
Navon’s model to account for additional variables as unearned revenues, payment periods, 
and warranty cost. Chen et al. (2004, accepted) further assesses the accuracy of operating CF 
models and concludes that payment conditions of general contractors to vendors have 
significant effects on the behavior of CF models. He subsequently proposes a cost flow 
forecasting model, adding payment frequency, time lag, component, and uncertainty variables 
into his operating CF model (Chen, submitted); nonetheless, Chen’s model is limited to only 
the creation of future cost flows.  
 
??????? 
In the preceding section, existing operating CF models and approaches were extensively 
critiqued. The criticism suggests that while there exist limited models that use future inputs 
(forecast work schedules and activities) for predicting future outputs (operating CFs), these 
limited models have evolved unevenly between the development of outflow and inflow 
mechanisms. Specifically, within these limited models and approaches, cost flow forecasting 
mechanisms have evolved much more sophisticated than sales flow forecasting mechanisms. 
This criticism implies that much of the current basis of operating CF forecasting remains 
inadequate to its task, and new models have to be developed. To achieve this task, two 
research questions are posed as the following.  
2.1. Research question 1: How can we develop an operating CF model that provides the 
balance of development between the forecasting mechanisms of outflows and 
 8
Cost-Schedule Integration (CSI) modules responsible for integrating sales (cost) resources of 
activities and their corresponding schedules, Cash Receipt-Schedule Integration (CRSI) and 
Payment-Schedule Integration (PSI) modules responsible for merging cash receipt (payment) 
resources of activities and their corresponding schedules, Data Reconciliation and Storage 
responsible for coordinating estimated, progress, and historical data, as well as storing data. 
While these symmetrical modules provide the backbone for unbiased development of inflows 
and outflows, the CSSI algorithm integrates, reconciles, and calculates the data processed by 
the modules.  
The methodology to develop the prototype system with the capability of implementing 
CSSI involves five steps. First, in conjunction with the proposed prototype architecture and 
the CSSI prediction model, we will develop the necessary components of the computer 
prototype system for implementing CSSI by the function analysis system technique (Dell'isola, 
1997; Mudge, 1989). Second, after necessary components are developed, we will establish 
their formats, design their details, and construct their protocols by stochastic approaches, with 
additional guidelines on existing work regarding cash flow systems (e.g., ????, Chen, 
2003; Chen and Chen, 2000; Hwee and Tiogn, 2002; Kaka, 1996; Kaka and Lewis, 2003; 
Kaka and Price; 1991, 1993; Kenley, 1999; Navon, 1995, 1996, 1997). Third, we will 
integrate and program the prototype system using database languages, such as Microsoft 
Assess or Microsoft Visual FoxPro. Fourth, we will then complete debugging and system test 
by the historical data of complete projects. Fifth, we will validate the prototype system by 
completing the system acceptance test using the pattern-matching logic (Trochim, 1989). 
Consequently, the contribution of research question 2 is the development of the prototype 
system capable of generating accurate, reliable operating CF predictions and associated 
knowledge about the designing and constructing process of the system.  
However, developing this computer prototype system requires fusing together four 
complex modules (SSI, CSI, CRSI, and PSI) to provide useful information, development of 
this system is somewhat harder than that of most integration systems performed in 
construction research that only incorporates cost and schedule information. To handle this 
challenge needs a comprehensive understanding of integration research with regard to cost, 
sales, and cash flow prediction systems. At this moment, we expect to resolve this challenge 
via scrutinizing how the existing research integrates and cleanses information so that 
information will be more constructively presented. We will start from the work of Abudayyeh 
and Rasdorf (1993) and Navon (1990, 1995, 1996, 1997).

This research develops a cost-schedules-sales integration (CSSI) operating CF prediction 
model that provides the balance of development between the forecasting mechanisms of 
outflows and inflows as to increase the accuracy of net operating CF predictions. The 
components and important results of CCSI model are discussed as the following: 
 
1. The CCSI model comprises of four components: Sales-Schedule Integration (SSI) 
and Cost-Schedule Integration (CSI) modules responsible for integrating sales (cost) 
resources of activities and their corresponding schedules, Cash Receipt-Schedule 
Integration (CRSI) and Payment-Schedule Integration (PSI) modules responsible for 
merging cash receipt (payment) resources of activities and their corresponding 
schedules. These four components coordinate one another and thus provide a balance 
between inflows and outflows regarding their accuracy and reliability. 
 
2. To show the difference of the accuracy and reliability between the CSSI model and 
the conventional CSI approach, this research runs several tests for comparison. 
Figure 3 depicts a comparison between historical operating cash flows by the 
conventional CSI, where CSI fails to provide a balance between the forecasting 
mechanisms of outflows and inflows. Figure 4 exhibits a comparison between 
historical operating cash flows by the CSSI model. As can be seen from these two 
figures, CSSI does show better a forecasting ability. 
 
3. The affects of payment uncertainty such as late applications for payment, late 
payments, variations in productivity that cause lateness compared to initial schedule, 
etc., all contribute some deviation from projected cost flows (Carr 1983). Likewise, 
the affects of payment uncertainty form project owners such as late payments and 
disapproved applications of payment caused by quality problems contribute some 
deviation from projected sale flows. Thus, it is expected that that the projected 
patterns will not match the historical observations (actual operating cash flows) 
exactly. Such evidence is also depicted in Figure 4.  
 
The future research should take this CSSI model to build a prototype. The methodology 
to generate the prototype system capable of performing the CSSI model is as the following: 
1. In conjunction with the proposed prototype architecture and the CSSI prediction 
model, this study will develop the necessary components of the computer prototype 
system for implementing CSSI by the function analysis system technique. 
2. After necessary components are developed, this study will establish their formats, 
design their details, and construct their protocols by stochastic approaches, with 
additional guidelines on existing work regarding cash flow systems. 
3. This study will integrate and program the prototype system using database languages, 
such as Microsoft Assess or Microsoft Visual FoxPro. 
4. This study will validate the prototype system by completing the system acceptance 
test using the pattern-matching logic. 
 
?????? 
The research results are complacent and are mostly as what we expected. We are 
currently working on papers related to this research. Because of the accuracy and reliability of 
the CSSI model, the model is useful for enhancing operating cash flow forecasting ability and, 
thus, increasing working capital’s optimal utilization of construction firms in the industry.

Abstract 
 
This paper presents a three-stage forecasting procedure for estimating the sales response to 
internal financial and macroeconomic variables. The procedure is based on a combined 
approach of ordinary least squares and generalized least squares. At a first stage, the 
procedure uses a two-stage process of data transformation to establish linear relationships 
between sales and internal financial and macroeconomic variables. At a second stage, the 
procedure uses regression analysis that is based on ordinary least squares for initial model 
building. At a third stage, Yule-Walker estimates and incomplete principal component 
analysis are subsequently applied for model restructuring, based on generalized least squares 
and ordinary least squares, respectively. The application of the procedure is shown to work a 
sample of two firms in Taiwan’s semiconductor industry.

1. Introduction 
 
While the importance of sales forecasting to business planning and management has 
been consistently recognized among researchers and practitioners (e.g., Cox, 1987, 1989; 
Fildes and Hastings, 1994; Mahmoud et al., 1988; Makridakis and Wheelwright, 1977; 
Mentzer and Gomes, 1994), sales forecasting models based on pure time series methods have 
evolved to allow detailed predictions for individual firms in technological industries. 
However, despite these models are able to provide excellent fits to historical data studied, 
these models will be capable of generating accurate, reliable sales forecasting only if 
approximately the same pattern of time variations continues in future sales.  
Recently, multivariate time series models with macroeconomic data have been proposed 
for technological product sales forecasting (e.g., Chiu and Shyu, 2004; Kuo et al., 2002). 
However, only a limited number of macroeconomic variables, such as national consumption 
expenditure and sales volume of alternative goods, have been considered. Moreover, while 
the financial position of an individual firm measures the competitiveness of the firm (e.g., 
Bodie et al., 2002; Wild, 2003), that the firm’s competitiveness assures its survival and 
expansion in the market is suggestive that there appears to be a link between sales and internal 
financial variables. These internal financial variables do not appear to be considered in the 
previous research.  
Research thus continues on refinements of multivariate sales forecasting models to 
exploring more explanatory variables embedded in the business cycle and financial conditions 
of firms. At this moment, this paper only intends to present the preliminary result of our 
ongoing research. This paper first briefly discusses the background of methods and 
approaches for sales forecasting. Next, this paper presents a systematic modeling 
methodology on the basis of multivariate time series regression models. Finally, the 
application of the methodology is shown to work a set of a sample of firms in Taiwan’s 
semiconductor industry.  
 
2. Background 
 
A review of literature suggests that there exist a large number of approaches and 
methods for predicting future sales, varying wildly in the level of complexity and accuracy. 
According to the data and methodologies used by these approaches and models, they can be 
generally categorized into two groups: the pure time series models, such as smoothing, 
moving average, Box-Jenkins, and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and 
the structural models, such as econometric models and the combined time series and 
regression analysis.  
The pure time series methods model past behavior of a process in an attempt to forecast 
future behavior, i.e., using past outcome of an event to predict future outcome of that event 
(e.g., Bretschneider et al., 1979; Cholette, 1982; Geurts and Ibrahim, 1975). Despite the pure 
time series models are able to provide excellent fits to historical data studied, these models 
will be capable of generating accurate, reliable sales forecasting only if approximately the 
same pattern of time variations continues in future sales (Luxhoj et al., 1996; Smith et al., 
1994). Further, the pure time series models appear to be inadequate for capturing the effects 
of endogenous and exogenous variables. Consequently, the pure time series methods will be 
particularly useful when little knowledge of the underlying data generating process is 
available.  
The structural models attempt to describe the causal relationship between an outcome 
variable and a number of explanatory variables (e.g., Arora, 1979; Chiu and Shyu, 2004; Kuo

Third, this study examined the effects of seasonal cycles and determined the order of the 
SF model using the Generalized Durbin-Watson test (Littell and Freund, 2000), followed by 
model restructuring using the Yule-Walker method detailed in (Shumway and Stoffer, 2000). 
The incomplete principal component regression was further performed to conclude the final 
SF model once there is multicollinearity in the model. Finally, this study validated the model 
using data splitting methodology that is well described in (Montgomery et al., 2001).  
 
4. Empirical Study 
 
In this study, the balance sheet and income statement data of firms were drawn from the 
Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation, while the economic data were drawn from the 
Department of Statistics, the Ministry of Economic Affairs of Taiwan. Because the disclosure 
of monthly financial statements is not mandatory for public companies in Taiwan, this study 
decided to use quarterly data as the basis for model building and forecasting. Nonetheless, 
model building based on quarterly data is considered appropriate in forecasting research (e.g., 
Chiu and Shyu, 2004; Lorek and Willinger, 1996).

For each sample firm, the balance sheet, income statement, and economic data were 
collected from 1995 Q1 to 2004 Q4, generating more than 2,700 data points used for the 
analysis. Because of space limitations, only a limited number of cases (shown in Table 1) will 
be presented in this paper. Data was gathered using case study research protocols (Yin, 2003), 
including use of multiple data sources (where possible) to assure quality of the data collected. 
The 40 observation data were split into two parts, the estimation data and the prediction data. 
The estimation data (the front 25 observations) were used to build the SF model, while the 
prediction data (the following 15 observations) were used to study the predictive ability of the 
model.  
A total of 33 internal financial and macroeconomic variables were transformed for each 
sample firm, using a two-stage process of data transformation. Stage 1 uses the, ratio 
transformationV Vi i( )−4 , where V denotes a response or regressor variable (i = 1, 2…, n), while 
stage 2 uses the, aggregation of ratio transformation V Vi ii

SF (c) = 2.0281 - 0.6473X4(t–1) + 0.9267X8(t–1) + 1.1398X16(t–1) 
Where X4(t–1) denotes quarterly accounts receivable turnover data of stage 2 for time t–1; X8(t–1) 
denotes quarterly total asset turnover data of stage 2 for time t–1; and X16(t–1) denotes quarterly 
basic earnings per share data of stage 2 for time t–1.  
 
The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was used to assess the predictive 
performance of SF models. The data used for prediction assessment purposes were from 2001 
Q2 to 2004 Q4. The MAPE is calculated as

where n is the number of time periods of prediction data.  
Assessment of the models can be divided into three phases based on the model building 
process. The first phase is the forecasting result of the SF model after passing the normality, 
heteroscedasticity, and model specification error tests, denoted as SF (a). The second phase is 
the forecasting result of the SF (a) model subsequent to the remedial measure for the effect of 
seasonal cycles, denoted as SF (b). The last phase is the forecasting result of the SF (a) model 
subsequent to the remedial measures for the combined effects of seasonal cycles and 
multicollinearity, denoted as SF (c).

Figure 2  Comparison between actual sales and predicted sales created with SF (b) for UMC 
 
5. Discussion 
 
As shown from Tables 2 and 3, the values of R-square ( R2 ) from the optimal fitted 
models of training data and those of MAPEprediction from the prediction data for TSMC and 
UMC firms were (99.91%, 1.79%) and (99.27%, 5.11%), respectively. This result suggests 
that there exists a strong linear relationship between sales and certain of internal financial and 
macroeconomic variables. Examples include accounts receivable turnover, total asset turnover 
and basic earnings per share significantly contributing to the accuracy of forecasting sales of 
the TSCM firm, and total asset turnover significantly contributing to the accuracy of 
forecasting sales of the TSCM firm.  
Further, although the MAPE values of the firms studied were relatively small (1.79% 
and 5.11%), the MAPE values were considerably enlarged after prediction data sets were 
transformed back to periodic sales, (20.86% and 21.55%), shown in Table 4. This 
enlargement is problematic, since theoretically the MAPE values should be the same before 
and after transforming back to sales. Future work is therefore needed to provide solutions for 
this problem and reduce the impact of such enlargement.
