 new porous sub-aerial model to improve the 
defect of the linearized resistance force with 
Darcy’s formula and the larger computational 
cost. Section 2 briefly describes the derivation 
of the second-order porous sub-aerial model. In 
Section 3, the fundamental properties of present 
model were analyzed with the results and 
conclusions drawn in Section 4.  
2. The derivation of the model 
equations 
In this section, a new depth-integrated 
model for wave flow in the porous sub-aerial 
structures is derived.

2.1 Governing equations and boundary 
conditions 
For convenience, the subscript ‘prime’ ( ' ) 
denotes the variables in dimensional form, the 
subscript ‘s’ denotes the variables that in 
porous layer, and the subscript ‘bar’ ( ) 
represents the depth averaged quantities. 
 As shown in Fig. 1, the porous media 
with effective porosity ( n ) is overlaying the 
impermeable bedrock at bz h ′′ = − . A wave train 
with the free surface displacement ς ′  
propagates in the porous media layer. By 
introducing 0a  is the characteristic wave 
amplitude, 0h  denotes the vertical length-scale, 
0l  represents the horizontal length-scale and 
0 0/l gh  means the time-scale, the dimension- 
less variables are defined as follows:

where ρ  is the density of water, 
P represents the pressure, ν denotes a 
magnitude of the ratio of the velocity is 
evaluated at a optimal depth in the porous layer 
to the velocity outside the porous layer (e.g. 
Cruz and Chen 2007), and the parameter μ  is 
dispersivity that equals to 0 0/h l . The dimensi- 
onless governing equations are given as the 
following,

Eqs. (2)-(4) are the governing equations 
in bh z ς− < < . In Eqs. (3)-(4), R is a time 
differential operator proposed by Sollitt & 
Cross (1972), the operator ∇  denotes the 
horizontal gradient vector, and Pˆ  means the 
gauge pressure on the free surface. Eqs. (5) and 
(6) are the free surface boundary conditions. Eq. 
(7) is the no-flux bottom boundary condition.   
By integrating the continuity equation 
with respect to z  form bz h= −  to z ς=  and 
applying the boundary conditions Eqs. (5) and 
(7), the continuity equation reads

Note that Eq. (8) is exact.  
2.2 Direct perturbation approach 
The assumptions proposed by Hsiao et al. 
(2002), the nonlinearity and the resistance force 
in permeable bed are assumed to be ( )1O , the 
frequency dispersion is assumed to be small 
( ( )2 1O μ << ), and the vorticities ( )s sy xu v−  is 
of ( )1O , are used in this paper. Particularly, 
the horizontal vorticities are weak and be 
required by the following conditions  
 where suβ
K  is the horizontal velocity 
evaluated at the optimal depth ( zβ ) in porous 
layer, and Rβ  denotes the operator R  
determined at zβ . The terms 1G  and 2G  are 
functions of suβ∇ ⋅ K  and ( )sbh uβ∇ ⋅ K , respective- 
ly. For non-movable bedrock, the condition, 
0bth = , must be satisfied. The term 3V  can be 
expressed as a vector, says ( ) ( )( )3 3s x s yV V, . 
3. Fundamental Properties 
A process for determining the zβ  of  
optimization the difference between linear 
theory and 1-D reduced model is demonstrated 
in this section. 
3.1 The reduced model equations 
To determine the optimal depth in the 
porous layer, a nondimensional parameter is 
introduced (Hsiao et al., 2002 ; Chen, 2006),  
/ bz hββ =  (23) 
The parameter β  is meaningful when the 
value is between -1 and 0 ( 1 0β− ≤ < ). 
Substituting β  into Eqs. (11) and (13) and 
keeping the 1-D linear terms , a linearized 
reduced 1-D model equations for simulating 
wave propagating in a constant porous layer 
can be described as follows

3.2 The exact formula 
To understand the applicable range of 
present model equation, it is necessary to 
compare it with the exact equation based on 
linear theory. The exact dispersion relation for 
linear water wave propagating in a 
homogeneous and isotropic permeable 
sub-aerial structure reads

3.3 Determination of the parameter  
The Boussinesq-type equations can be 
extended to intermediate water depth by 
evaluating the optimal value of relative depth. 
The same idea can be applied to the present 
model. The detail about the determination of 
optimal depth can be found in Nwogu (1993) 
and Hsiao et al. (2002). This section introduces 
the constrained equation that used by present 
model equations and analyzes the linear 
property of 1-D reduced model and the exact 
equations. The verification of the applicable
