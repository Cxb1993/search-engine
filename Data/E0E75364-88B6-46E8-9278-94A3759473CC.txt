2.英文摘要： 
This paper discusses the nonlinear stochastic 2 /H H∞  output feedback control design with 
state-dependent noise. Our results extend the linear stochastic 2 /H H∞  control to the nonlinear 
output feedback case. First, based on stochastic Nash game theory, an observer-based nonlinear 
stochastic 2 /H H∞  control is developed when the state variable is not completely available. 
Then, the nonlinear stochastic 2 /H H∞  observer-based output feedback control problem is 
transformed into two constrained optimization problems subject to their respective 
Hamilton-Jacobi inequality (HJI) from the suboptimal perspective, one for the design of 2 /H H∞  
controller and the other for the design of 2 /H H∞  observer. Finally, the solvability of the mixed 
2 /H H∞  observer-based output feedback control for nonlinear stochastic systems is discussed 
and an example with computer simulations is given to confirm the performance of the proposed 
method. 
Key words: Nonlinear stochastic system, observer-based output feedback control,  
Stochastic 2 /H H∞  control, Hamilton-Jacobi inequality. 
 
3.簡介   
In the last two decades, H∞  control is an important robust control design to efficiently 
attenuate the effect of external disturbance, and has been widely employed to deal with the robust 
performance control with uncertain disturbance [1-7,15]. Obviously, there may be more than one 
solution to H∞  control design problem with a desired robustness. There are some degrees of 
freedom to design for other specifications of control performance. Therefore, control engineers 
want the controller not only to attenuate the effect of uncertain disturbance, but also to achieve 
some control performance when the worst-case disturbance is imposed. Since the 2H  
performance is more appealing for control engineering design, it naturally leads to the mixed 
2 /H H∞  control design problem [1-6, 8, 12, 13]. In the case of observer for state estimation (i.e. 
the filter design case), although H∞  estimation (filtering) performance offers better robustness 
with respect to the attenuation of external disturbances than 2H  estimation performance, H∞  
estimation performance has a large intolerable estimation error variance which 2H  estimation 
performance can suppress. Therefore, the mixed 2 /H H∞  estimation performance attempts to

In this paper, we develop an observer-based mixed 2 /H H∞  control based on Nash dynamic 
game method for nonlinear stochastic systems.  In view of (1), the stochastic Nash game theory 
consists of two control performances 1( , )J u v  and 2 ( , )J u v , which are associated with the H∞  
robustness and the 2H  optimization, respectively. The mixed 2 /H H∞  control can be 
converted into finding the Nash equilibria * *( , )u v , such that ([1], [5])

Obviously, if (28) doesn’t contain the control input u , the disturbance 1v  and the standard 
Wiener process ( )W t , then the corresponding unforced deterministic system has three 
equilibrium points, i.e., two stable equilibrium points at 2x = ±  and one unstable equilibrium 
point at 0x = . Figure 1 shows the response of the open-loop system in this case with the initial 
state (0) 5, 5, 0.1x = + − +  or 0.1− , respectively. Now we want to design a nonlinear stochastic 
observer-based 2 /H H∞  controller for the system (28) with a prescribed attenuation level

γ = . 
To obtain the mixed 2 /H H∞  controller by solving the constrained optimization in (23), the 
positive definite function ( )V x  is specified as 2( )V x Px x= + . 
After solving (23) and (24) with Matlab, we get the optimal solution with P =0.0101. 
Therefore, the mixed 2 /H H∞  controller is 
* 2ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ( ) 0.0808 4.0606 3 sgn( )u x x x x= − − − . 
Then we choose the Lyapunov function ( )U η , the observer gain function ˆ( )G x  and the
