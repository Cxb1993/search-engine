Abstract 
Since general lighting accounted for a significant portion of electricity consumption, to 
develop new efficient lighting source is one of the most important energy-saving strategies. Among 
various techniques, the development and use of high-efficiency solid-state lighting to replace the 
conventional lighting sources is the most promising one. It has been proved in recent years that 
organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) demonstrated high external quantum efficiencies for 
converting electrical energy to light. Hence, the development of white OLEDs (WOLEDs) holds 
great promise for the production of high efficient large-area lighting source. In order to make 
WOLEDs succeed in the lighting applications, further improvements still need to be made in device 
efficiency, longer lifetime, brightness, and the generation of illumination-quality white light. The 
goal of this proposal is to improve the performance of WOLEDs for the lighting purpose by 
integrating various technologies. This project is to conduct a comprehensive review of the current 
existing technologies for device efficiency improvement. We studied the following techniques: 
simplified device architecture, identical-spectrum phosphorescent sensitization, conducting doping 
technique, and several novel true-blue phosphors developing. These techniques do not conflict with 
each other and can be studied simultaneously.  
In this project, we proposed the design rules for simplifying the device architecture by 
adopting appropriate materials’ combination. We had demonstrated that the efficient phosphorescent 
blue and white OLEDs can be fabricated with double-layer architecture. Secondly, the novel idea of

以下分項說明本年度內之研究內容與成果： 
I. 功率效率的提升 
Ⅰ. 1. 簡化架構元件架構技術: 
探討藉由對材料特性的探討與認知，針對目前有機發光元件架構最複雜藍色磷光，
調整元件多層架構組合，並能維持原多層複雜架構元件之發光效率，提出藍色磷光元件
結構簡單化的法則。其優點在於可降低材料更換的頻率，減少不同真空腔體的機台設備，
而簡化結構的元件可使製程規範擴大，元件良率將能有效提升，實現低成本量產化目標。
另外，利用開發出的簡化架構設計成白光元件，探討在簡化架構下，白光元件的色偏、
效率等整體表現問題。此計劃之核心研究為透過寬能隙主體材料搭配具高三重態激子阻
擋特性、高載子遷移率的傳輸材料及結構調整，探討簡化藍色磷光元件架構的規則，並
製作出高效率雙層藍色磷光元件及三層白色磷光元件。  
Ⅰ. 1. A. 簡化藍色磷光元件架構 
藍色磷光發光元件必須要搭配三重態能隙寬的主體材料[1-3]，能量才不會經放熱
反應由客體再回到主體材料，導致激子浪費而造成效率降低；另外，載子復合區位置
應設計於主發光層中，以提高載子復合機率，所以必須謹慎調整相對的載子傳輸平衡；
此外，經復合所形成之高能量的三重態激子，需利用載子傳輸層或發光層主體材料本
身的高三重態能隙，使激子被有效侷限在發光層中，以免高能量三重態激子擴散飄移，
經能量移轉給較低能隙的載子傳輸材料，或被金屬電極焠熄；另外，元件的發光區應
調整至較佳的光耦合輸出位置，以提高整體元件效率。藉由上述藍色磷光元件設計規
則，元件架構如圖二所示。 
我們在元件中使用藍色磷光材料 FIrpic 作為客體發光材料，其三重態能隙ET =2.7 
eV，主體材料選擇具有寬三重態能隙之材料 mCP (ET =2.9 eV)，其三重態能隙夠大，可
避免能量回傳的問題，又因 mCP 與 Firpic 的放光光譜與吸收光譜有良好的重疊，以
期能在載子於主體材料上復合後，有效形成能量移轉，另外搭配使用  TAPC 及 
TmPyPB 做為電洞傳輸層及電子傳輸層材料，與發光層的能隙差較其他高能隙的材料
來得小，且具有高載子遷移率及高三重態能隙的優點。然而為了更進一步簡化結構，
考量其三重態能隙匹配及有效能量移轉的前提下，將優先保留原發光層，設計上必須
在電子傳輸及電洞傳輸層做選擇，由於發光層本身為電洞傳輸能力遠優於電子傳輸能
力之主體材料，若將電子傳輸層去除，將使發光層與金屬陰極接觸，金屬表面電漿會
造成嚴重激子焠熄，若保留電子傳輸層，去除電洞傳輸層的設計，可以利用導電高分
子材料(PEDOT:PSS)來形成複合電極， 其具有電洞傳輸功能，其功函數又介於電極與
有機材料之間，非常適合用來取代電洞注入的角色。 
我們以三層架構設計出對照組元件 Device A，為調整元件之載子平衡，我們將 
TAPC 及 TmPyPB 的膜厚調整為 30 nm 及 50 nm，最佳化之元件其最大外部量子效率

Os 雙發光層的介面上時，其紅光強度在低電流密度下較低，而當電壓增加，復合區朝
向 mCP: FIrpic/ TmPyPB 介面擴張，更多激子能在 Os 磷光上復合放光，而在藍光客
體上的三重態激子也能經能量移轉至紅光客體上，使得元件能在不同偏壓下維持色穩

體材料之雙發光層(藍+白)，設計原理之假設與先前元件相同。

以 Device W1 三層架構元件之電流密度及亮度較大，其原因應與先前推論相似，雙層
架構易產生載子累積，當系統中摻雜 Os(bpftz)2(PPh2Me)2[5] ，其 HOMO 僅 4.8 eV，
遠低於 TAPC (5.4 eV)、mCP (5.9 eV)或 FIrpic (5.8 eV)，將產生嚴重電洞補陷現象，亦
會提高電洞累積於發光層靠近電洞傳輸層之區域，加速劣化元件而造成較低的亮度，
而元件量子效率及功率效率，Device W1 三層架構元件較佳，載子在該元件架構中，
其載子較為平衡，而 Device W1 產生的光色為暖白光，其 100 到 5000 cd/m2 之色偏
僅有(0.006, 0.003)，Device W2 產生的光色亦為暖白光，其 100 到 5000 cd/m2 之色偏
僅有 (0.026, 0.002)，雖較 Device W1 稍差，但以雙層元件而言，其表現相當優異，未

由表三數據比較可知，綠色、黃色及紅色磷光敏化機制皆可以達到減緩效率遽降
的問題，三重態激子焠熄有明顯改善作用，但由於螢光材料的吸收與 FIrpic 的放光頻
譜重疊情況各異，使得能量移轉不完全的情況也各異，其中以綠色及紅色的頻譜重疊
較佳，期能量移轉效果佳，而黃光的情況則否，此實驗證明吸收與放光頻譜重疊對於
在磷光敏化系統能量移轉之重要性。

High-color-rendering white
organic LEDs based on novel
phosphors
Chih-Hao Chang, Chung-Chia Chen, Yun Chi, and
Chung-Chih Wu
A combination of efficient true-blue iridium complexes and improve-
ments to device architecture significantly enhances the color perfor-
mance of white-emitting organic LEDs.
Intrinsically high-quantum-efficiency, white-emitting organic
LEDs (WOLEDs) incorporating phosphorescent emitters have
become promising candidates for meeting stringent efficiency
requirements in lighting applications. High-quality white-light
illumination requires WOLEDs with International Commission
on Illumination (CIE) coordinates similar to those of blackbody
radiation, a correlated color temperature between 2500 and
6500K, and a color-rendering index (CRI) above 80. Until re-
cently, one of the major bottlenecks in implementing high-CRI
phosphorescent WOLEDs was the lack of efficient deep-blue
phosphors. Using a series of efficient true-blue iridium
complexes that we developed, and incorporating two comple-
mentary colors or three primary colors, we were able to achieve
high-color-rendering pure-white phosphorescent OLEDs.
We prepared two-component WOLEDs using our new blue
iridium1 Ir(dfbppy) (fbppz)2 and yellow osmium Os(bptz)2
(dppee) complexes. The WOLEDs had high CRIs thanks to
the large full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of both the
blue and yellow emissions. We used a triple-emitting layer
structure to stabilize the colors with varied biases (operation
voltages). The layers included ITO (indium tin oxide used as
an anode)/30nm of ˛-NPD (hole-transport material)/15nm of
TCTA (hole-transport material)/5nm of TCTA:Os(bptz)2(dppee)
1wt% (weight percent)/15nm of CzSi (wide-energy-gap host
material):Ir(dfbppy)(fbppz)2 6wt%/5nm of BCP (electron-
transport material):Os(bptz)2(dppee) 2wt%/40nm of BCP/2nm

150nm of Al (aluminum used as a cathode). Figure 1 shows the
chemical structures of the phosphors and the device structures.

cyclometalated chelates plus one ancillary ligand with a
greater ligand-centered pp* energy gap, such that its inter-
ference to the photoexcitation, relaxation, and consequent
luminescence can be minimized. On the other hand, reports
on the highly emissive homoleptic IrIII complexes with all
cyclometalated chelates are still rare.[3] An obstacle lies in
the higher temperatures required for their syntheses, be-
cause the majority of cyclometalated chelates cannot with-
stand such stringent reaction conditions, leading to severe
decomposition.[4] In sharp contrast, noncyclometalated ho-
moleptic complexes such as trisubstituted acetylacetonate
[Ir ACHTUNGTRENNUNG(acac)3],
[5] quinolinolate [Ir(Q)3],
[6] and even picolinate
complexes [Ir ACHTUNGTRENNUNG(pic)3] are known;
[7] unfortunately, none of
them exhibit respectable room-temperature phosphores-
cence in both fluid and solid states.
Following this research direction, we have examined the
reactions of IrCl3·nH2O with 3-tert-butyl-5-(2-pyridyl) pyra-
zole ((bppz)H) and with 3-trifluoromethyl-5-(2-pyridyl) pyr-
azole ((fppz)H) in anticipation of isolating the respective
homoleptic complexes mer-[Ir ACHTUNGTRENNUNG(bppz)3] (1a) and [Ir ACHTUNGTRENNUNG(fppz)3]
(1b).[8] Although these IrIII complexes failed to exhibit the
anticipated bright phosphorescence at room temperature,
we serendipitously observed a unique case of dual emission,
of which the intensity ratio and the associated relaxation dy-
namics of each peak show remarkable temperature depend-
ence. This result highlights an unusual intraligand charge-
transfer (ILCT) to ligand-to-ligand charge-transfer (LLCT)
conversion, that is, an electron-transfer-like excited-state
process (see below) for which the LLCT has not only low-
ered the emission efficiency but also resulted in an unwant-
ed bathochromatic shift.[8]
Herein, we report the mechanistic details that gave the
formation of both 1a and 1b, which is highlighted by the
isolation of two reaction intermediates (cis-2a and cis-2b
and trans-3a and trans-3b) upon treatment of IrCl3·nH2O
with only two equivalents of (bppz)H and (fppz)H chelates.
Their role in the transformation is also established.
We have extended the scope of these investigations by
employing other chelating azolate ligands (3-tert-butyl-5-(1-
isoquinolyl) pyrazole, (bipz)H and 3-trifluoromethyl-5-(1-
isoquinolyl) pyrazole, (fipz)H), and have obtained the relat-
ed trisubstituted mer-[Ir ACHTUNGTRENNUNG(bipz)3] (4a) and [IrACHTUNGTRENNUNG(fipz)3] (4b).
Remarkably, both complexes showed bright-orange phos-
phorescence at RT, giving the opportunity to examine their
latent applications as OLED dopants. For complex 4a, the
performance data were compared with a previously reported
heteroleptic IrIII complex with a single isoquniolinyl azolate
ligand, [IrACHTUNGTRENNUNG(dfpz)2 ACHTUNGTRENNUNG(bipz)] (5).
[9] This comparison provides a
case in point to evaluate the effect of emitting chromophoric
chelates. Therefore, the data accumulated in this study allow
us to gain more insight into the photophysical and device
behavior between two closely related molecular designs.
Results and Discussion
Synthesis and characterization : It has been reported that
IrCl3·nH2O reacts with two equivalents of cyclometalated li-
gands, for example (C^N)H, in 2-ethoxyethanol at reflux
under fairly mild conditions to give excellent yields of the
chloride-bridged dimer, [(C^N)2IrACHTUNGTRENNUNG(m-Cl)]2 (Scheme 1). Crys-
tallographic studies show that each octahedral IrIII metal
center of the dimer is coordinated by the two bridging chlor-
ides and two C^N chelates for which the neutral N donor is
located at the trans disposition.[10] The respective tricyclome-
talated complexes [IrACHTUNGTRENNUNG(C^N)3] were then obtained upon
treatment of this chloride-bridged dimer with more cyclome-
talated ligand at a higher temperature.[11] In yet another ap-
proach, [Ir ACHTUNGTRENNUNG(C^N)3] can also be obtained by simply combin-
ing the iridium reagents, for example, [IrACHTUNGTRENNUNG(acac)3] or
IrCl3·nH2O, with an excess of C^N ligands at significantly
higher temperatures or in presence of a chloride scaveng-
er.[12]
Recent reports indicated that both the cyclometalated
ligand (C^N)H and pyridyl azole ligand (N^N)H are capa-

proton) that is essential to balance the formal negative
charge associated with the IrIII fragment. One possibility is
to assign this proton on the water molecule present in the
asymmetric unit. If this were the case, complex 2a can be
considered as an anionic fragment with the tentative formu-
la cis-[Ir ACHTUNGTRENNUNG(bppz)2Cl2]
 .
In the case of 3b, however, the chlorides adopt a trans-
disposition with the pyrazolate chelates residing on the four
corners of the equatorial plane. Note that both pyridyl
groups of fppz chelates are now arranged in a cis fashion to
one another. Such a geometrical feature is in sharp contrast
with that observed in the related octahedral OsII complexes,
in which the pyrazolate chelates showed distinctive trans ori-
entation along with the formation of a pair of CH···N
inter-ligand hydrogen bonding.[17] This unusual structural ar-
rangement gives a hint to the position of unidentified
proton in 3b that lies in between the N(3) and N(6) atoms
of the pyrazolate fragments. Again, the location of this hy-
drogen atom cannot be unambiguously defined.
Figure 3 gives the ORTEP diagram of the trisubstituted
isoquinolinyl complex 4a, showing the meridional arrange-
ment of bipz ligands that is attributed to the reduction of
steric repulsion among tert-
butyl substituents, whereas the
facial isomer would have all
three tert-butyl groups pointing
towards the identical triangular
face of octahedral coordination
geometry and cause excessive
spatial congestion. Moreover,
the IrN bond lengths for iso-
quinolinyl (2.073–2.040 )
and pyrazolate fragments (2.027 and 2.010 ) are reminis-
cent of those observed in previously reported 1a, but are
shorter than those (2.16 and 2.11 ) of the related het-
eroleptic [Ir ACHTUNGTRENNUNG(C^N)2ACHTUNGTRENNUNG(N^N)], for which the unique pyridyl
azolate N^N chelate resides opposite the carbon atom of
both cyclometalated chromophores.[18] Note that the N(8)
atom of 4a shows the shortest IrN bond length of
2.010(6) , which is due to the increased interaction at this
pyrazolate site and less competition (in view of the bonding)
from its trans-isoquinolinyl group, and the latter shows the
longest IrN(1) length of 2.073(5)  of all IrN interactions.
Photophysical data : The absorption and emission spectra of
4a and 4b are displayed in Figure 4 and the data are sum-
marized in Table 1. Both complexes exhibit well-resolved
pp* transitions 365 nm (e3104m1 cm1), whereas the
lower-energy shoulder around 430 and 400 nm (e
104m1 cm1) is reasonably attributed to the tailing of pp*
transitions that are mixed, to a certain extent, with metal-to-
ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transitions. The whole as-
signment is well supported by the well-matched absorption
spectral patterns versus those of 1a and 1b (see Figure 5),[8]
except that all peaks appear at relatively longer wave-
lengths, due to the greater p conjugation of the iso ACHTUNGTRENNUNGquin ACHTUNGTRENNUNGolinyl
than that of the pyridyl moieties.

sition for 4a (445 nm) and 4b
(383 nm) are close to the ob-
served onsets (an appearance of
a shoulder in Figure 4) of the
absorption spectra recorded in
CH2Cl2 solution. Moreover, the
calculated energy gaps of the T1
states for 4a (558 nm) and 4b
(532 nm) are also in agreement
with the trend of the first vi-
bronic peak of their emission
spectra. This result indicates
that the time-dependent DFT
(TDDFT) calculation, in a
qualitative manner, can predict
the lowest Franck–Condon ab-
sorption in the singlet manifold
as well as the phosphorescence
energy gap based on the S0 geo-
metries of the studied organo-
metallic complexes.
As for the transition charac-
teristics, frontier orbital analy-
ses indicate that 4a and 4b
show the lowest-lying S0–T1
transition composed of ligand
pp* transfer and, to a lesser
extent (<15%), of MLCT. The
pp* domination indirectly sup-
ports the vibronic progression
depicted in the phosphores-
cence spectra. As shown in
Tables 2 and 3, the lower-lying
triplet manifold for 4a and 4b
consists of two sets of closely
lying transitions, T1 –T3 and T4–
T6, for which the calculated
energy difference among T1–T3
(or T4–T6) are very small
(<2 kcalmol1), which, within
theoretical error, may be treat-
ed as two sets of triple degener-
ate states. Detailed frontier or-
bital analyses also led to the
conclusion that the T1–T3 and
T4 –T6 states, in view of pp*
transitions only, could be as-
signed to ILCT (within bipz or
fipz moiety) and LLCT (pyra-
zolate!isoquniolinyl moiety),
respectively. The energy differ-
ence between ILCT and LLCT
is calculated to be as large as
approximately 12 kcalmol1
and 19 kcalmol1 for 4a and
4b, respectively. Compared

ining the electron transport/
hole blocking, charge/carrier
balance and for optimizing the
device performances. Finally,
LiF was used as the electron-in-
jection layer. The energy levels
of different materials used in
the devices (taken from refer-
ences or those estimated from
the cyclovoltammetry data of
4a and 5) are also marked in
Figure 9 for reference.
The electroluminescence
(EL) characteristics are summa-
ACHTUNGTRENNUNGrized in Table 4, whereas the representative EL characteris-
tics (EL spectra, current-voltage-brightness (I-V-L) and effi-
ciencies) for devices A3 and B3 are depicted in Figure 10.
As can be seen in Table 4, all devices A1–A3 showed the ex-
pected orange-red emission with CIEx,y of (0.55, 0.45;
CIEx,y= the 1931 Commission Internationale de LEclairage
(x,y) coordinates). This characteristic suggests that the emis-
sion is exclusively derived from phosphor 4a, indicating effi-
cient exothermic energy transfer from host to guest mole-
cules and effective exciton confinement in the emitting
layer. Note that the adoption of different electron-transport-
ing materials has notable effects on the I-V-L characteristics.
For example, higher current density and luminance were ob-
tained in devices A1 (BCP) and A2 (TPBi), the results of
which are perhaps associated with the higher electron mobi-
lities of BCP and TPBi as well as the different capability in
carrier injection.[25] On the other hand, a significantly higher
peak external quantum efficiency of 14.6% photon/electron
was obtained for the A3 device that employs the lower-mo-
bility material, TAZ, for which the peak luminescence effi-
ciency and the power efficiency went up to 34.8 cdA1 and
26.1 LmW1, respectively. At the practical brightness of

perscript. For a cation that is relevant to hole transport,
Figure 12 qualitatively depicts the potential energy surface
as a function of nuclear coordinate. The numerical data
listed in Table 5 indicate that the larger lhole for 4a reveals
poor hole-transporting properties. Apparently, by using the
relatively lower electron-mobility TAZ as the ETL can
reduce the rate difference between holes and electrons, the
result of which optimizes device performance effectively,
giving better external quantum efficiency. As for complex 5,
the relatively low HOMO energy decreases its hole-trapping
ability (smaller lhole), subtly altering the scenario of the car-
rier transport/balance and the exciton formation.
The above results reveal the interesting and subtle influ-
ences of ligating chromophores not only on the emission but
also on the electrical characteristics of phosphors. Because
both properties are critical in OLED devices, it in turn im-
plies that in designing effective phosphors for PhOLEDs,
not only the photophysical characteristics (colorant, quan-
tum yields) but also their electrical behavior must be consid-
ered. Hence, these closely related designs provide a good
example of how these may be fine-tuned through chelating
architectures.
Conclusion
In summary, a rational design has been presented for a new
series of homoleptic iridium ACHTUNGTRENNUNG(III) complexes, en route from
the isolation of two intermediates 2a and b and 3a and b
that both involve the coordination of two pyrazolate che-
lates as well as two terminal chlorides, to give the corre-
sponding complexes with either a cis-Cl,Cl or a trans-Cl,Cl
arrangement. Further conversion from these intermediates
to the homoleptic, meridional 1a and 1b with tris(pyridyl
pyrazolates) resulted in intermediates with similar structures
being proposed en route to the formation of 4a and 4b with
tris(isoquinolinyl pyrazolates). For complexes 1a and 1b,
they demonstrate the unprecedented photophysical property
of dual phosphorescence. The fast decay of the blue phos-
phorescence (P1 band) at room temperature is attributed to
the rapid conversion from TILCT to TLLCT states followed by
perhaps a TLLCT!3MC!S0 deactivation process. The cur-
rent result also agrees with previous reports for the related
homoleptic IrIII metal complexes such as mer- and fac-[Ir-
ACHTUNGTRENNUNG(dfppy)3], ((dfppy)H=4,6-difluorophenyl pyridine), in
which the meridional isomer is always less emissive at room
temperature compared with its facial counterpart under
identical conditions.[31] We believe that a similar electron-
transfer process is operative for mer-[Ir ACHTUNGTRENNUNG(dfppy)3], which in-
duces a rapid radiation-free deactivation pathway, giving
poor emission at room temperature. We thus expect that the
interplay between TILCT to TLLCT may, in general, play a key
role for spectroscopy and dynamics of the homoleptic-me-
ACHTUNGTRENNUNGrid ACHTUNGTRENNUNGional types of transition-metal complexes.
As for the isoquinolinyl derivatives 4a and 4b, both
showed bright-orange emission in the solid state, among
which 4a was selected as a prototype phosphor for the fabri-
cation of phosphorescent OLEDs, showing the maximum
external quantum efficiency as high as 14.6%. The respec-
tive performance data were superior to the OLEDs fabricat-
ed by using a related phosphor 5 with a single isoquinolinyl
pyrazolate chromophore. These results also showed that not
only the chromophoric ligand with the lowest energy gap,
but also other ancillary ligands are important for controlling
the efficiency and color of devices. The results would spark
a broad spectrum of interest in the field of inorganic photo-
chemistry and OLED research.
Experimental Section
General methods and materials : Mass spectra were obtained on a JEOL
SX-102 A instrument operating in electron impact (EI) mode or fast
atom bombardment (FAB) mode. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were record-
ed on Varian Mercury-400 or INOVA-500 instruments; chemical shifts
are quoted with respect to the internal standard tetramethylsilane for 1H
and 13C NMR data. Elemental analyses were carried out at the NSC Re-
gional Instrumentation Center at National Chao Tung University, Hsin-
chu (Taiwan). The pyridyl pyrazole chelates, namely: 3-tert-butyl-5-(2-
pyridyl) pyrazole (bppz)H, 3-trifluoromethyl-5-(2-pyridyl) pyrazole
(fppz)H,[32] and their isoquinolyl derivatives, 3-tert-butyl-5-(1-isoquinolyl)
pyrazole (bipz)H and 3-trifluoromethyl-5-(1-isoquinolyl) pyrazole
(fipz)H[33] were prepared according to the literature procedures. All reac-
tions were conducted under an N2 atmosphere by using anhydrous sol-
vents or solvents treated with an appropriate drying reagent.
Preparation of (1a): A suspension of sodium carbonate (372 mg,
1.85 mmol) was treated with (bppz)H (196 mg, 1.85 mmol) in diethylene
glycol monoethyl ether (DGME, 25 mL). After stirring for 1 h,
IrCl3·3H2O (185 mg, 0.53 mmol) was added and the solution was heated
under reflux for 12 h. Excess water was added after cooling the solution
to room temperature. The precipitate was filtered, purified by silica-gel
column chromatography eluting with ethyl acetate, and crystallized from
a mixture of CH2Cl2 and hexane at room temperature to render light-
yellow mer-[Ir ACHTUNGTRENNUNG(bppz)3] (1a, 222 mg, 0.28 mmol, yield=53%). The deriva-
tive mer-[IrACHTUNGTRENNUNG(fppz)3] (1b) was prepared by using a similar procedure
(yield=50%).

devices including those for patterning and cleaning of ITO substrates fol-
lowed those described in the literature.[36]
Computational methodology : Calculations on electronic singlet and trip-
let states of complexes 1a, 1b and 4a, 4b were carried out by using a
hybrid Hartree–Fock/density functional model (PBE1PBE) based on the
Perdew-Burke-Erzenrhof (PBE) functional.[37] Restricted and unrestrict-
ed formalisms were adopted in the singlet and triplet geometry optimiza-
tion, respectively. A “double-z” quality basis set consisting of Hay and
Wadts effective core potentials (LANL2DZ)[38] was employed for the Ir
atom, and a 6-31G* basis set[39] was employed for H, C, N, and F atoms.
The relativistic effective core potential (ECP) replaced the inner core
electrons of IrIII metal atom, leaving the outer core (5s25p6) electrons and
the 5d6 valence electrons to be concerned. TDDFT calculations by using
the PBE0 functional were then performed[40] based on the optimized
structures at ground states in combination with an integral equation for-
malism-polarizable continuum model in dichloromethane (IEF-PCM),
implemented in Gaussian 03.[41] Typically, the lowest triplet and singlet
roots of the nonhermitian eigenvalue equations were obtained to deter-
mine the vertical excitation energies. Oscillator strengths were deduced
from the dipole transition matrix elements (for singlet states only). All
calculations were carried out by using Gaussian 03.[42]
The electronic configurations of 3MC dd states were calculated following
the literature methodology.[20] The 3MLCT state geometry was obtained
by performing geometry optimization along the triplet state potential-
energy surface (PES) by using the X-ray structural data as the initial ge-
ometry. As for the 3MC state, because the electron densities are mainly
distributed on the central metal atom, the chelating interaction between
metal and ligands must be rather weak. We thus performed geometry op-
timization of the 3MC state following the methodology illustrated in the
work of Persson et al.[20] The method starting with a distorted geometry,
for which the metal–ligand bonds are largely elongated, such that its as-
sociated energy is expected to be far away from the global minimum
along the PES. Based on this methodology, the optimization is then able
to fall into the presumably shallow local minimum associated with the
3MC dd excited state. The resulting 3MC dd excited state structure was
then confirmed by the net spin values located on the transition metal
from the Mulliken population analysis. The frontier orbitals and net spin
values of the 3MC dd state for complexes 1b and 4b are depicted in the
Supporting Information for reference (Figures S3 and S4).
Compositions of molecular orbitals in terms of the constituent chemical
fragments were calculated by using the AOMix program.[43] For the char-
acterization of the HOMOx!LUMO+y transitions as partial charge-
transfer (CT) transitions, the definition of the CT character in [Eq. (4)]
has been used in which %(M)HOMOx and%(M)LUMO+y are elec-
tronic densities on the metal in HOMOx and LUMO+y, respectively.
CTðMÞ ¼ %ðMÞHOMOx%ðMÞLUMOy ð4Þ
If the excited state (e.g., S1 or T1) is formed by more than one one-elec-
tron excitation, then the metal CT character of this excited state is ex-
pressed as a sum of CT characters of each participating excitation, i!j,
as shown in [Eq. (5)] in which CI (i!j) are the appropriate coefficients
of the Ith eigenvector of the CI matrix.

Accordingly, one can very effectively use the MO compositions in terms

transitions.

We report highly efficient phosphor-sensitized solid-state light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs)
utilizing a phosphorescent cationic iridium complex [Ir(dFppy)2(SB)]
+(PF6
) as the host and
a fluorescent cationic dye (R6G) as the guest. Photophysical studies show that R6G retains a high
photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) in highly polar media, revealing its suitable use as an
emitting guest in an ionic host matrix. Such solid-state LECs achieve quantum efficiency (cd A1)
efficiency, and power efficiency up to 5.5% photon/electron, 19 cd A1 and 21.3 lm W1, respectively.
The device quantum efficiency achieved is among the highest reported for fluorescent LECs and is
higher than one would expect from the PLQY of the R6G fluorescent dye in the host film, thus
indicating that phosphor-sensitization is useful for achieving highly efficient fluorescent LECs.
Moreover, using narrow-band fluorescent emitters, such as R6G (FWHM, 50 nm), is effective in
improving the color saturation of solid-state LECs based on cationic complexes.
Introduction
Solid-state light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) possess
several advantages over conventional organic light-emitting
diodes (OLEDs). In LECs, electrochemically doped regions
induced by spatially separated ions under a bias form ohmic
contacts with electrodes, giving balanced carrier injection, low
operating voltages and consequently high power efficiencies.1,2
As such, LECs generally require only a single emissive layer,
which can be easily processed from solutions, and can conve-
niently use air-stable electrodes, while OLEDs typically require
more sophisticated multilayer structures and low-work-function
cathodes.3 Compared with conventional polymer LECs, which
are usually composed of an emissive conjugated polymer, a salt
and an ion-conducting polymer,1,2 LECs based on cationic
transition metal complexes show several further advantages and
have attracted much attention in recent years.4–15 In such devices,
no ion-conducting material is needed since these metal complexes
are intrinsically ionic. Furthermore, higher electroluminescent
(EL) efficiencies are expected, due to the phosphorescent nature
of the metal complexes.
As in OLEDs, the host–guest approach, i.e. spatially
dispersing the emitting guest into a matrix complex (host), had
been reported to be an effective way to tune the emission color or
to improve the emission efficiency of solid-state LECs based on
cationic transition metal complexes.11,16 Thus far, all host–guest
LECs based on previously reported cationic complexes were
implemented by doping the phosphorescent cationic complexes
(guest) into the host cationic complexes, which were also phos-
phorescent. Nevertheless, doping fluorescent guests into phos-
phorescent hosts may be an alterative way to achieve efficient/
color-tunable host–guest LECs, since, in conventional OLED
technologies, phosphor-sensitization had been proved to be
useful in raising the efficiency of fluorescent OLEDs to similar
levels to phosphorescent OLEDs. In phosphor-sensitized fluo-
rescence, the heavy-metal center of the phosphorescent host
mediates rapid inter-system crossing for efficient intramolecular
singlet-to-triplet energy transfer, and thus subsequent effective
F€orster energy transfer17 from triplet excitons of the phosphor
host to singlet excitons of the fluorophore guest, harvesting both
singlet and triplet excitons in hosts.18,19 The shorter excited-state
lifetimes of fluorescent guests could also possibly reduce the
triplet–triplet annihilation issues in purely phosphorescent
devices, which is associated with high triplet populations induced
by long excited-state lifetimes of triplet excitons. As a result,
device efficiencies of phosphor-sensitized fluorescent OLEDs
could approach those of phosphorescent OLEDs.18,19 Despite its
successful use in OLEDs, however, up to date, there is no
demonstration or report of employing phosphor-sensitized
fluorescence in host–guest solid-state LECs based on cationic
transition metal complexes. In this work, we report investiga-
tions on Ir-complex-based solid-state LECs utilizing phosphor-
sensitized fluorescence.18,19

Concentration-dependent PLQYs of R6G and DCJTB doped in
PMMA films, in [Ir(dFppy)2(SB)]
+(PF6
) films, and in
[Ir(dFppy)2(SB)]
+(PF6
)/BMIM+(PF6
) (where BMIM is
1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium) films are depicted in Fig. 3(a) and
Fig. 3(b), respectively. The ionic liquid [BMIM+(PF6)
] was
added to enhance the ionic conductivity of thin films and
consequently to shorten the LEC response times.8 Meanwhile,
excited-state lifetimes for R6G-doped films (at 600 nm) and
DCJTB-doped films (650 nm) as a function of doping concen-
trations in various host films were also characterized and are
depicted in Fig. 4(a) and 4(b), respectively. Excited-state lifetimes
on the order of nanoseconds for both guests in
[Ir(dFppy)2(SB)]
+(PF6
) or [Ir(dFppy)2(SB)]
+(PF6
)/[BMIM+-
(PF6)
] hosts again confirm the phosphor-sensitized fluorescent
emission.
As shown in Fig. 3(a) and 3(b), both R6G and DCJTB possess
high PLQYs of60% in the non-ionic PMMAhost matrix at low
doping concentrations. In the ionic [Ir(dFppy)2(SB)]
+(PF6
) or
[Ir(dFppy)2(SB)]
+(PF6
)/[BMIM+(PF6)
] host matrices, R6G
retains high PLQYs of 40–50% over the concentration range
tested, which is indeed enhanced over the PLQY (31%) of the
[Ir(dFppy)2(SB)]
+(PF6
) neat film. In contrast, when doped into
the ionic [Ir(dFppy)2(SB)]
+(PF6
) or [Ir(dFppy)2(SB)]
+(PF6
)/
[BMIM+(PF6)
] host matrices, PLQYs of DCJTB have dropped
significantly down to #10%, even at low doping concen-
trations (which is even lower than the PLQY of the
[Ir(dFppy)2(SB)]
+(PF6
) neat film). Such differences in the
photophysical properties of DCJTB and R6G may be associated
with their different responses in media of different polarities, and
thus we further characterized their PLQYs and excited-state
lifetimes in two solvents of different polarity, MeOH (more
polar) and CH2Cl2 (less polar). These results are summarized in
Table 1. As shown in Table 1, DCJTB exhibits significantly
lowered PLQYs and shortened excited-state lifetimes in more
polar MeOH than in CH2Cl2. Photophysical transitions of
DCJTB are of significant intramolecular charge-transfer nature
and thus the substantial decrease of its PLQY in highly polar
solvents (or solid-state host matrices) is mostly due to strong
interactions between highly polarized excited-state chromo-
phores and surrounding molecules.
On the other hand, R6G shows lower PLQYs and shorter
excited-state lifetimes in less polar CH2Cl2 than in MeOH. R6G
shows a high PLQY of 0.89 in highly polar methanol (MeOH),
but a lower PLQY of 0.63 in less polar dichloromethane
(CH2Cl2). Similar phenomena were also observed when
dispersing R6G in solid-state hosts of different polarities. In
Fig. 3(a), one notices that R6G exhibits higher PLQYs in an
[Ir(dFppy)2(SB)]
+(PF6
) or [Ir(dFppy)2(SB)]
+(PF6
)/[BMIM+-
(PF6)
] film than in a PMMA film for doping concentration of
0.251.0 wt.%; while in Fig. 4(a), one notices excited-state life-
times are shortened for the R6G-doped PMMA than for R6G-
doped [Ir(dFppy)2(SB)]
+(PF6
) or [Ir(dFppy)2(SB)]
+(PF6
)/
[BMIM+(PF6)
]. In particular, with the addition of
BMIM+(PF6
) (19 wt%) in the cationic host, even higher PLQYs
and longer excited-state lifetimes occur in the host–guest systems,
perhaps due to dilution effects and reduced interchromophore
quenching.11 Lower PLQYs and shorter excited-state lifetimes
for R6G in less polar solvents (hosts) is mostly associated with
charge-transfer interactions (deactivation processes) between
excited-state cations and associated anions (Cl), since the anions
cannot be fully dissociated with the cations in less polar solvents
(hosts).21 In view of the above results, ionic fluorescent dyes like
R6G appear more suitable than neutral organic dyes like DCJTB
for use as guests in phosphor-sensitized fluorescent LECs, in
which host materials are ionic and polar.
It is noted that the PLQY of R6G-doped PMMA increases
and yet R6G-doped [Ir(dFppy)2(SB)]
+(PF6
) decreases when the
doping concentration decreases from 0.25 to 0.05 wt%
(Fig. 3(a)). In R6G-doped PMMA, the increase of the PLQY
with a decrease of the doping concentration is due to reduced
self-quenching, which is accompanied by increased excited-state
lifetimes (Fig. 4(a)). R6G-doped [Ir(dFppy)2(SB)]
+(PF6
) also
shows a similar increasing trend when reducing the doping
concentration from 1.0 to 0.25 wt%, but an opposite trend is
observed for further reducing the doping concentration. Energy

host–guest energy transfer and the FWHM of the EL spectra are
thus broader. As the doping concentration increases, efficient
energy transfer suppresses the host emission and the EL spectra
resemble their PL spectra (Fig. 2), rendering a reduced FWHM.
Compared with LECs based on neat films of
[Ir(dFppy)2(SB)]
+(PF6
), which possess broad EL emission
(FWHM, 100 nm), phosphor-sensitized LECs here exhibit
much more saturated EL spectra, indicating that such a tech-
nique is effective for color tuning and maybe also for achieving
more saturated colors by appropriate combinations of phos-
phorescent hosts and fluorescent guests.
Peak EQEs and peak power efficiencies (at current densities
<0.2 mA cm2) of phosphor-sensitized fluorescent LECs with
various R6G doping concentrations are shown in Fig. 7. The
device EQE decreases monotonically while the device power
efficiency first increases then decreases as the doping concen-
tration increases from 0.05 to 0.2 wt%. Since both devices with
0.05 and 0.1 wt% R6G show similar EQEs and device currents
under the same constant bias voltage, a higher power efficiency
obtained from the 0.1 wt% R6G-doped device is attributed to
better matching between its EL spectrum (Fig. 6) and the lumi-
nosity function,26 which renders higher lumen values of the EL
emission. With a R6G doping concentration of 0.05 wt%, the
peak EQE (cd A1) efficiency and power efficiency of the phos-
phor-sensitized fluorescent LEC reach 5.5%, 19 cd A1 and 21.3
lm W1, respectively. The achieved EQE of 5.5% is among the
highest reported for fluorescent solid-state LECs.27,28
The maximal EQE (5.5%) achieved from R6G-doped phos-
phor-sensitized LEC is significantly higher than that (2.5%) one
could expect from a typical layered all-fluorescent device with an
emission PLQY of 50% and an optical out-coupling efficiency
of 20%. It confirms efficient phosphor-sensitization of fluo-
rescence in LEC devices, which enables harvesting of host triplet
excitons via F€orster energy transfer17 from triplet excitons on the
phosphor to singlet excitons on the fluorophore.18,19 However,
the maximal EQE obtained is still lower than the value (10%)
one could expect from a typical layered all-phosphorescence
device with a similar emission PLQY. Moreover, as the R6G
concentration increases from 0.05 to 0.2 wt%, the PLQY of the
emissive layer increases (Fig. 3(a)) while the device EL efficiency
decreases (Fig. 7). Such phenomena suggest two possible exciton
loss mechanisms: Dexter transfer29 and/or direct carrier trapping
to form triplet excitons on guest molecules. Dexter transfer takes
place between host triplets and guest triplets when the guest
concentration increases, which would degrade the EL efficiency
when occurring.18 Direct carrier trapping results in formation of
triplet exctions on guest molecules directly and would degrade
device efficiency, as well. Carrier trapping impedes carrier
transport and thus lowers the device current under the same bias
voltage as doping concentration increases. The energy levels of
host and guest molecules shown in the inset of Fig. 8 were esti-
mated by cyclic voltammetry (CV, see the Experimental section
for details). The energy-level offsets between host and guest may
result in carrier trapping. However, as shown in Fig. 8, the device
current density does not show a clear decreasing trend as the
R6G doping concentration increases; the difference in currents
between different devices is within the experimental errors.
Hence, at low doping concentrations (<0.2 wt%), direct carrier
trapping perhaps plays a minor role in the degradation of device
efficiency and concentration-dependent Dexter transfer may be
more dominant in the present host–guest LEC devices. More
studies of appropriate host–guest combinations with a sup-
pressed Dexter transfer may be beneficial to further enhancement
of device efficiencies of phosphor-sensitized fluorescent solid-
state LECs.
Conclusions
In summary, we have reported highly efficient phosphor-sensi-
tized solid-state LECs utilizing a phosphorescent cationic iridium
complex [Ir(dFppy)2(SB)]
+(PF6
) as the host and a fluorescent
cationic dye R6G as the guest. Photophysical studies show that
R6G retains a high PLQY in highly polar media, revealing its
suitable use as an emitting guest in an ionic host matrix. Such
solid-state LECs achieve quantum efficiency (cd A1), efficiency,
and power efficiency of up to 5.5% photon/electron, 19 cd A1
and 21.3 lm W1, respectively. The device quantum efficiency
observed is among the highest reported for fluorescent LECs and
is higher than one would expect from the PLQY of the R6G
fluorescent dye in the host film, thus indicating that phosphor-
sensitization is useful for achieving highly efficient fluorescent
LECs. Moreover, using the narrow-band fluorescent emitters,

In this work, the impedance spectroscopy was adopted to characterize conductively doped
organic hole-transport layers. We performed comparative studies of the impedance spec-
troscopy of undoped and doped hole-transport materials, by both experiment and simula-
tion approaches. The impedance spectroscopy of the non-doped hole-transport material
can be well understood by simply adopting the conventional RC equivalent circuits and
considering the dielectric response frequency-independent. For the conductively doped
organic hole-transport materials, however, successful modeling of the impedance spectros-
copy results need to take into account the more complicated situations: including the dif-
ference between the bulk region and the depletion region near the electrode, and
dispersion (i.e. frequency dependence) in the dielectric response of the conductively doped
transport layer. As such, it is found necessary to include the complex dielectric response
and the non-conventional complex impedance element in the equivalent circuit to achieve
tight matching of simulated results with experiment results over wide bias and frequency
ranges.

1. Introduction
Since ﬁrst reports of efﬁcient organic light-emitting
diodes (OLEDs) in 1980s [1], OLEDs have attracted substan-
tial research efforts and have now become one of the most
promising technologies for displays and solid-state light-
ing [2–5]. To further enhance OLED performances, conduc-
tive doping of carrier-transport materials in OLEDs has
been adopted and is becoming an important technology
due to their various merits [6–12]. Conductive doping of
carrier-transport materials in OLEDs could largely facil-
itate carrier injection and increase the conductivity of
organic semiconductors, both capable of reducing opera-
tion voltages and increasing efﬁciencies of OLEDs. Thus,
more detailed understanding of the operation mechanisms
and electrical properties of conductively doped organic
carrier-transport materials could be of use to applications
and advancement of such technologies.
Impedance spectroscopy has been a useful tool for
probing the electrical/dielectric properties and operation
mechanisms of organic and inorganic semiconductors/de-
vices [13–16]. With the aid of impedance spectroscopy,
one in principle can construct the equivalent circuits of
the devices and thereby obtain more insights about the
operation of the materials and devices [17–19]. In this
work, we adopted the impedance spectroscopy to charac-
terize conductively doped organic hole-transport layers
for OLEDs. We performed comparative studies of the
impedance spectroscopy of undoped and doped hole-
transport materials, by both experiment and simulation
approaches. The impedance spectroscopy of the non-doped
hole-transport material can be well understood by simply

to ﬁt the curves under different bias voltages are shown in
Table 1. In Table 1, one sees that Cp remains rather constant
versus bias voltage for the frequency range measured (as
the geometric capacitance is supposed to be) and Rp drops
signiﬁcantly as the bias voltage increases. It makes sense
since more carrier are injected into the device (leading to
higher carrier concentrations) and thus the layer resistance
drops when the dc bias voltage is raised. By assuming a
nominal dielectric constant of 3 typical for organic layers,
the thickness of the m-MTDATA ﬁlm is estimated to be
107 nm from the Cp value, which is consistent with the
deposited m-MTDATA thickness veriﬁed by ellipsometry.
Fig. 4 shows the measured Cole–Cole plots of the
F4-TCNQ-doped (2 wt.%)m-MTDATA device under different
dc bias voltages. In contrast to the undoped device, the
doped device exhibits two semicircle-like features, particu-
larly at lower dc bias conditions.When the dc bias increases,
one feature shrinks quickly and the two semicircles appear
to merge together. The difference in impedance spectros-
copy for undoped and doped devices can be further mani-
fested by comparing Re(Z) and Im(Z) of both devices as a
function frequency. Fig. 5a and b shows Re(Z) versus fre-
quencyunder different bias voltages for undoped anddoped
devices, respectively. Fig. 6a and b showsIm(Z) versus fre-
quencyunder different bias voltages for undoped anddoped
devices, respectively. From results of Figs. 4–6, one sees that
under a similar dc bias, in general the doped device exhibits
a much smaller (absolute) magnitude of the impedance
(much smaller semicircles in the Cole–Cole plots, much
smaller Re(Z) and Im(Z) at lower frequencies). It manifests
that with the conductive doping, the carrier conduction in
the carrier-transport layer is largely enhanced.
For Cole–Cole plots containing two semicircles, an
equivalent circuit consisting of series connection of two
parallel RC circuits, like that shown in Fig. 7, is often effec-
tive. A series connection of two parallel RC circuits is
usually associated with a device containing two layers or
two regions of different electrical characteristics. For the
present case, although the organic layer was deposited as
a single doped layer, yet Riess et al. [13] previously re-
ported that in the conductively doped organic carrier-
transport layer, a depletion region could occur near the
electrode with larger energy level mismatch. Thus, for
the present F4-TCNQ-doped (2 wt.%) m-MTDATA device,

curves, indicating the equivalent circuit in Fig. 7 is not
good/complete enough. Also, with the circuit model of
Fig. 7, one would expect a dependence of CJ on the bias
[13]. Yet from the ﬁtting values shown in Table 2, one no-
tices that the junction capacitance CJ does not show a
strong dependence on biases. This is partially due to the
limited bias range shown (more signiﬁcant increase of CJ
can be seen at higher forward biases). On the other hand,
with doubts on the accuracy and completeness of the sim-
ple RC model, one suspects how much the extracted CJ val-
ues reﬂect the real situations.
Riess et al. [13] also similarly observed signiﬁcant devi-
ations in ﬁttings of impedance spectroscopy results of the
conductively doped carrier-transport layer using the
equivalent circuit of Fig. 7. Riess el al. [13] mentioned that
the imperfect ﬁttings might result from the frequency (x)
dependence of the conductivity rðxÞ and dielectric con-
stant eðxÞ and spatial inhomogeneities in the thickness
and dopant concentration etc., whose effects are not in-
cluded in the simple equivalent circuit of Fig. 7. Thus, a
more accurate and physically meaningful equivalent cir-
cuit/model is needed to reproduce impedance characteris-
tics of the conductively doped organic transport layer.
Later, Leo et al. [22] suggested the adoption of a distributed
circuit element called constant phase element (CPE)
[17,23,24] to replace the regular capacitance, for taking
into account the dispersive properties (e.g. frequency
dependence of the dielectric properties) and for better
modeling impedance characteristics of conductively doped
organic carrier-transport ﬁlms. The impedance of a CPE has
the general form of Z(x) = Q(jx)a, where Q is a constant
parameter and the parameter a can assume values be-
tween 0 and 1. The parameter a describes the degree of
the capacitive character; when a = 1, the CPE is like a reg-
ular capacitance. The introduction of this CPE distributed
element may include effects of the distribution of energy
states and/or spatially distributed conductivity etc. By
replacing the regular capacitances in Fig. 7 with the corre-
sponding CPE elements, the modiﬁed equivalent circuit is
shown in Fig. 9. The optimized ﬁttings to the measured
Cole–Cole plots (under different dc biases) of the
F4-TCNQ-doped m-MTDATA device using such an equiva-
lent circuit and the parameters listed in Table 3 are shown
in Fig. 10. Compared to results of Fig. 8 using the equiva-
lent circuit of Fig. 7, the ﬁttings are improved, but still
deviations from measured curves are apparently visible
and there is room for further improvement of the model/
equivalent circuit.
Results of Fig. 10 based on the equivalent circuit of
Fig. 9 indicate that simply replacing regular capacitances

parallel R/CPE circuits, (which is modiﬁed from Fig. 7 by replacing regular
capacitances with constant phase elements).

obtained over a wide bias and frequency range by using the
equivalent circuit of Fig. 11b. These results indicate the
effectiveness of the equivalent circuits of Fig. 11a and b
for the conductively doped organic carrier-transport layer.
In Table 4, one notices that the CPE for the depletion region
(CPEJ) has the a value signiﬁcantly lower than 1, suggesting
of more dispersive character. One also notices that the
layer resistances of doped devices are much smaller than
RP in the non-doped device. With increasing bias, the resis-
tance of the depletion region (RJ) decreases signiﬁcantly.
From the extracted values of equivalent circuit elements
(e.g. comparing CJ and CB) in Table 4, one can estimate
the thicknesses of the bulk region and the junction region
to be 70–90 nm and 10–30 nm, respectively, for the bias
range shown. From the Q and capacitance values, one can
also estimate the average relaxation time s0 to be on the
order of 105 s, which is within the frequency range stud-
ied here and thus has noticeable inﬂuences on impedance
spectroscopy.
The impedance spectroscopy of conductively doped
hole-transport layers in this work indicates that a higher-
impedance depletion region would occur when the energy
level of the conductively doped hole-transport layer does
not well match that of the adjacent layer in the OLED de-
vice (e.g. undoped hole-transport layer, emitting layer,
electrode etc.). If occurring, that might degrade beneﬁts
provided by the conductively doped hole-transport layer
(improved injection and conductivity, lowered operation
voltage etc.). Thus to optimize OLED performances, even
with adoption of conductively doped carrier-transport lay-
ers in devices, it is still worthy of carefully considering
matching of energy levels of relevant materials layers to
avoid/minimize such depletion phenomena. Furthermore,
the dispersive dielectric responses induced by the conduc-
tively doping (and corresponding polarization relaxation)
could have impacts on high-frequency operation (e.g.
>10 kHz) of organic devices, in addition to regular RC
effects.
4. Conclusions
In summary, the impedance spectroscopy was adopted
to characterize conductively doped organic hole-transport
layers for OLEDs. We performed comparative studies of the
impedance spectroscopy of undoped and doped hole-
transport materials, by both experiment and simulation
approaches. The impedance spectroscopy of the non-doped
hole-transport material can be well understood by simply
adopting the conventional RC equivalent circuits and con-
sidering the dielectric response frequency-independent.
For the conductively doped organic hole-transport materi-
als, however, successful modeling of the impedance spec-
troscopy results need to take into account the more
complicated situations: including the difference between
the bulk region and the depletion region near the elec-
trode, and dispersion (i.e. frequency dependence) in the
dielectric response of the conductively doped transport
layer. As such, it is found necessary to include the complex
dielectric response and non-conventional complex imped-
ance element in the equivalent circuit to achieve tight
matching of simulated results with experiment results
over wide bias and frequency ranges.

1. Introduction  
Phosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLEDs) have been the subjects of extensive investigations in recent 
years because of their undoubted promise in both display and lighting applications. However, the 
fabrication of blue PhOLEDs is very arduous because it requires a host with extremely wide-gap. In 
addition, these processes are exceedingly cumbersome and complicated, rendering mass production 
fraught with difficulties and causing the manufacturing yield to plummet. Therefore, it is pertinent to 
simplify the architecture of the PhOLEDs without compromising performance. In this study, we 
successfully demonstrated blue PhOLEDs with an external quantum efficiency of ~21% in a double-layer 
architecture. 
2. Result and Discussion 
Multi-stack structure design is much easier than that of the simplified architecture because 
complicated architectures typically offer several adjustable parameters for optimization. In general, the 
emitting layer (EML), which comprises of the host and dopants, occupies a higher priority in the design 
sequence. The triplet energy gap of the host and carrier-transport materials must be higher than that of the 
FIrpic (2.7 eV) to guarantee exciton confinement in the EML. Until recently, host materials possessing 
the electron-transport and ambipolar characteristics as well as a large triplet gap are very rare. Compared 
to scattered host materials with electron-transport or ambipolar characteristics, wide-gap materials with 
hole-transport characteristics seem to be more diversified. For instance, 1,3-bis(9-carbazolyl)benzene 
(mCP), 9-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-3,6-bis(triphenylsilyl)-9H-carbazole (CzSi), and 3,5-bis(9carbazolyl) 
tetraphenylsilane (SimCP) are three prime examples of high performance in blue PhOLEDs according to 
the previous reports [1-3]. The triplet energy gaps of CzSi, SimCP and mCP (2.9~3.0 eV) are wide 
enough to ensure efficient exothermic energy transfer. However, the HOMO or LUMO levels of the host 
should match those of the adjacent carrier transporting layers for optimal hole and electron injection, 
respectively. Thus, considering the fact that the singlet energy gap and the ionization potential of mCP are 
comparatively lower, mCP was the first choice for reducing the energy barriers between the hole-
transport layer (HTL)/EML and EML/electron-transport layer (ETL). Once the host and emissive dopant 
were determined, the next step was to seek the appropriate carrier-transport materials. We tested di-[4-
(N,N-ditolyl-amino)-phenyl]cyclohexane (TAPC) and 1,3,5-tri[(3-pyridyl)-phen-3-yl]benzene (TmPyPB) 
respectively as the HTL and ETL [4]. The results obtained showed that both possess the advantages of 
wide triplet energy gap and high carrier mobility. The TAPC has a low ionization potential whereas the 
TmPyPB possesses a high ionization potential and can be used to retard excessive hole injection into the 
ETL. Both carrier-transport materials can counter the exciton diffusion and match the HOMO and LUMO 
levels of the mCP host simultaneously. Hence, the architecture of the control device (i.e. Device A) was: 
ITO/ TAPC (30 nm)/ mCP: FIrpic 8 wt.% (20 nm)/ TmPyPB (50 nm)/ LiF (0.5nm)/ Al (150 nm), where 
LiF and aluminum were used as the electron-injection layer and cathode, respectively.  
Since the carrier recombination zone (RZ) should be located away from the cathode to avoid 
exciton quenching, the preservation of the transporting layer was critical for further simplifying the 
device architecture. The carrier RZ mainly formed near the interface between materials with opposite 
transport properties. Hence, the carrier RZ near the EML/ETL interface was to be expected because of the 
hole-transport nature of the mCP. The HOMO levels of the TAPC and PEDOT:PSS were rather similar. 
Consequently, the conductive polymer, PEDOT:PSS, combined with ITO as transparent anode, holds a 
distinct advantage in that the planarization of the ITO substrate could be used to replace the HTL. Device 
B, with the double-layer structure, was composed of: ITO/ PEDOT:PSS (~30 nm)/ mCP: FIrpic 8 wt.%

Abstract --- Near theoretical maximum quantum efficiency of blue phosphorescent organic light-emitting 
devices (PhOLEDs) was achieved by utilizing double-layer architecture. Two wide-triplet-gap materials, 1,3-
bis(9-carbazolyl)benzene (mCP) and 1,3,5-tri[(3-pyridyl)-phen-3-yl]benzene (TmPyPB), were employed in 
emitting and electron-transport layers. The opposite carrier-transport characteristics of these two materials 
were used to define exciton formation zone and thus increase the probability of recombination. The efficiency at 
practical luminance (100 cd/m2) were up to 20.8%, 47.7 cd/A and 31.2 lm/W, respectively.

INTRODUCTION 
Ever since C. W. Tang and S. VanSlyke invented the double-layer structure with hole-transport and 
electron-transport materials to reduce the operation voltage of OLED in 1987, researchers have been focusing on 
finding the distinct functionalities of various materials to improve OLED's performance. Among the most 
advanced architectures utilized in the more promising studies are the transparent anode, hole-injection layer 
(HIL), hole-transport layer (HTL), emitting layer (EML), electron-transport layer (ETL), electron-injection layer 
(EIL), and reflective cathode.These multiple-layer configurations have merits in many aspects, like reducing 
energy barrier between materials, modulating carrier balance, and controlling exciton diffusion. However, the 
complicated processes are cumbersome in mass production and will decrease manufacturing yield. Therefore, it 
is extremely important to simplify the architecture of the OLEDs without compromising performance.  
The sky-blue phosphorescent emitter, iridium(III) bis[(4,6-di-fluorophenyl)-pyridinato-N,C2’]picolinate 
(FIrpic), had been shown to have photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield that could reach nearly 100% in wide-
gap hosts. Hence, this emitter has continued to attract considerable attention and significant progress has been 
made in recent years. However, until recently, the FIrpic-based OLEDs often made use of multi-stack structures. 
In this study, we successfully demonstrated that blue PhOLEDs attained ~21% external quantum efficiency in a 
double-layer architecture. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Multi-stack structure design is much easier than that of the simplified architecture because complicated 
architecture architectures typically offer several adjustable parameters for optimization. In general, a common 
triple-layer OLEDs usually consists of a hole-transport layer/electron-blocking layer (HTL/EBL), an emitting 
layer (EML) and an electron-transport layer/hole-blocking layer (ETL/HBL). Among the three, the EML, which 
comprises of the host and dopant, occupies a higher priority in the design sequence. The triplet energy gap of the 
emitting host and carrier-transport materials must be higher than that of the FIrpic (2.7 eV) to guarantee exciton 
confinement in the emitting layer. The carrier-transport characteristics of the host materials could be roughly 
categorized as hole-transport, electron-transport and ambipolar. Host materials possessing the electron-transport 
and ambipolar characteristics as well as a large triplet gap are very rare. Compared to scattered host materials 
with electron-transport or ambipolar characteristics, the wide-gap materials with hole-transport characteristics 
seem to be more diversified. For instance, 1,3-bis(9-carbazolyl)benzene (mCP), 9-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-3,6-
bis(triphenylsilyl)-9H-carbazole (CzSi), and 3,5-bis(9carbazolyl)tetraphenylsilane (SimCP) are three prime 
examples of high performance in blue PhOLEDs according to the previous reports [1-3]. The triplet energy gaps 
of CzSi, SimCP and mCP (~3.0 eV, 3.0 eV and 2.9 eV) are wide enough to ensure efficient exothermic energy 
transfer. However, the HOMO or LUMO levels of the host should match those of the adjacent carrier 
transporting layers for optimal hole and electron injection, respectively. Thus, considering the fact that the 
singlet energy gap and the ionization potential of mCP are comparatively lower, mCP was the first choice for 
reducing the energy barriers between the HTL/EML and EML/ETL.  
the unmatched carrier mobility of the materials used at higher operation voltages might also cause a significant 
efficiency roll-off. Nevertheless, Device B exhibited very high external quantum efficiency in the practical 
luminance range. 
To investigate the location of the RZ and the balance condition, we also designed double-layer 
configurations based on the architecture of Device B (i.e. Devices C1, C2 and C3). In the Device C series, the 
original emitting layer was divided into an intrinsic mCP layer (10 nm) and a FIrpic doped emitting layer (10 
nm). (Device C1: mCP (10 nm)/ mCP: Firpic 8 wt.% (10 nm); Device C2: mCP (5 nm)/ mCP: Firpic 8 wt.% (10 
nm)/ mCP (5 nm); Device C3: mCP: Firpic 8 wt.% (10 nm)/ mCP (10 nm)).  
By comparing the IV curves of Device B and the Device C series in Figure 2(a), the higher current density of 
Device B revealed that the guest (i.e. the FIrpic) assisted hole-transport in the EML, a fact proven in the earlier 
studies. The turn-on voltages of Device C1 (3.9 V) and C2 (3.8 V) were similar to that of Device B (3.8 V). 
When the selected doping region shifted away from the mCP/TmPyPB interface in Device C3, the injected 
electrons became obstructed by the poor electron-transport ability of the mCP, leading to a boost in the operating 
voltage. Overall, Device B and C1 exhibited very similar electrical behaviors as well as efficiencies, even 
though the thickness of EML was halved in Device C1 (Figure 2(b)). The carrier still achieved balance without 
FIrpic being doped in the region close to the anode side. The almost identical efficiency curves confirmed that 
the RZ was indeed located near the mCP/TmPyPB interface. With the selected doped region gradually shifted 
away from the mCP/TmPyPB interface, both the efficiency and luminance continued to drop. Both EL spectra of 
Device C2 and Device C3 revealed a noticeable near-UV emission from the mCP (Figure 2(c)). These results 
indicated that the energy transfer between the host and the guest was inadequate.  
In conclusion, by utilizing a hole-transport emitting host and an electron-transport material, an efficiency 
close to the theoretical limit was attained in a novel design with double-layer architecture. We successfully 
demonstrated double-layer blue PhOLEDs which yielded external quantum efficiency, luminance efficiency, and 
power efficiency of 20.8%, 47.7 cd/A, and 31.2 lm/W respectively at 100 cd/m2. The benefits of the simplified 
configuration are lower costs and improved yield in mass production.
