Abstract 
Biochemical applications of microchips often require rapid mixing of different fluid 
samples. At the microscale level, the fluid flow is usually a highly ordered laminar flow and 
diffusion is the primary mechanism for mixing due to the lack of disturbances, yielding 
inefficiency for practical biochemical analysis. In this work, we design a prototype active 
micro-mixer by employing the electrothermal effect. We apply to the flow micro-channel a 
non-uniform AC electric field, which can generate the electrothermal force to the fluid flow and 
induce vortex pairs for enhancing mixing efficiency. The performance of this active micro-mixer

1. Background of the Project 
Labs on chips for biochemical applications often require rapid mixing of different fluid 
samples. At the macroscopic level, systems mix fluids usually by using mechanical actuators or 
by taking the advantage of turbulent fluctuations. Transition from laminar to turbulent flow in a 
pipe takes place when the Reynolds number Re uL  for macroscale reaches 2300, where   
is the fluid density, u  the flow velocity, L a characteristic length in the flow field, and   the 
fluid dynamic viscosity. In systems fabricated by the micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) 
techniques the dimensions of a channel are in the range of micrometer scale. The Reynolds 
number is so low that the flow in a micro-channel is usually a highly ordered laminar flow. 
Therefore, mixing different samples by turbulent fluctuations is not practical or even impossible. 
At the microscale level, the lack of disturbances yields diffusion to be the primary mechanism for 
mixing. However, while mixing of larger molecules such as peptides, proteins, and high 
molecular-weight nucleic acids, it usually takes a long time and requires a long micro-channel to 
accomplish the required mixing quality. Such hindrance is too severe to perform a real-time 
biochemical analysis, in particular for clinic applications. Therefore, effective mixing of fluid 
samples for microfluidic systems calls for alternatives.  
Microscale mixing devices can be categorized into passive or active types [1, 2]. Passive mixer 
typically adapts particular channel geometry and obstacle configuration to increase the interfacial 
area between fluids to be mixed [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. For examples, Liu et al. [3] presented an 
experimental study on mixing fluids with a three dimensional serpentine microchannel, Wang et 
al. [6] presented a numerical investigation of mixing in microchannels with patterned grooves, 
and Stroock et al. [7] proposed a staggered herringbone design to yield a chaotic mixing for a 3 
cm long mixer with rather small back pressure. On the other hand, active mixers utilize moving 
parts or external forces, such as pressure, magnetic field, or electric field, to generate disturbances 
in the flow field to improve mixing efficiency [8, 9, 10, 11]. For examples, Fu et al. [9] proposed 
the use of electro-osmotic forces generated by the electrodes imposed with direct electric current 
in a double-T-form microfluidic mixer. Feng et al. [10] proposed a mixing approach in terms of 
electrodes embedded on the sidewalls of a T-form microfluidic mixer to investigate an 
electrothermal effect on mixing efficiency in a narrow (40 m ) microchannel. Further, Cao et al. 
[11] demonstrated induced electrothermal vortices on mixing efficiency in a narrow (50 m ) 
microchannel by a two dimensional numerical simulation, where the electrode pairs are still 
embedded on the sidewalls of the microchannel. 
Passive mixers usually create a large flow resistance due to the geometrical configuration with 
obstacles, and require a larger pumping power. Alternatively, it adapts a long channel (say, 
several cm) to reduce the backpressure [7]. In contrast, active mixers provide very good mixing 
with negligible flow resistance for a micro size flow channel (say, several hundred m ) under the 
cost of external driving power to create mixing vortex. Most previous existing simulations dealt

A small amount of Joule heating could give a temperature rise in the fluid of a micro-channel. In 
order to estimate the temperature increment for a given electrode system, the following energy 
balance equation must be solved [15]:

thermal conductivity of the fluid, respectively, and

 E
 is the Joule heating as a source term. 
The above governing equations are only computed when the active micro-mixer is simulated.   
For both the active and passive micro-mixers, the flow field and the concentration field are 
required. In this work the fluid flow is assumed to be incompressible so that

where   is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid and p  is the pressure. Furthermore, it is assumed 
that the density   and viscosity   are constant independent of temperature and concentration.

where  A  is the concentration of the sample and D is the diffusion coefficient of the sample.  
The definition of mixing quality by Engler et al. [16] will be used to quantify the mixing 
performance. The mixing quality   is calculated by 
 8 
profile with the average velocity 
41 10  u   m/s. Mechanical boundary conditions are p = 0 at 
the outlet and no-slip elsewhere at the solid walls. Finally, for the concentration field, there is a 
constant concentration of 1 mol/m
3
 at one input boundary, and 0 mol/m
3
 at the other one. Thus 
maximum variance of the mixture max  in Eq. (8) is 0.5 mol/m
3
, and the optimal mixing 
concentration max
[ ]A
 in the Eq. (9) is 0.5 mol/m
3
, too. At the outlet, the sample flows through the 
boundary by convection. The walls of the micro-mixer are insulated for this dissolved sample.      
 
Comparison between active and conventional passive micro-mixer 
The numerical simulations have been performed using the finite element analysis software, 
COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS
TM
 version 3.4 (COMSOL Ltd., Stockholm, Sweden) [17]. All results 
have been examined to be mesh independent by means of a normal convergence test. Figure 2 
shows the concentration fields for the plain, passive, and active mixers. The passive mixer and 
the active mixer are designed to have roughly 90% and 85% mixing quality, respectively (see 
Table 1). The simulations show that the peak velocities in the mixing channel for these three 
mixers are 2.247
410 m/s,  2.72510-3 m/s and 4.21510-3 m/s, respectively. There are obvious 
increases of flow velocity for both the active and passive mixers. Table 1 presents the mixing 
quality , the pressure drop p between the inlet and outlet and the mixing efficiency   for 
these three mixers. As shown in Table 1, the mixing qualities for the active and passive mixers 
respectively raise by 66.2% and 70.8% over the plain mixer. The enhancement of diffusion and 
convection by placing plate obstacles in the passive mixer and the electrothermally driven stirring 
vortices in the active mixer cause the mixing qualities of these two mixers better than that of the 
plain mixer. Also shown in Table 1, the pressure drops between the inlet and outlet of the channel 
for the three mixers are 0.237 Pa, 88.71 Pa, and 0.241 Pa, respectively. It is noted that the vortex 
flow induced by the electrothermal force for the active mixer virtually does not increase the flow 
resistance. However, the large number of obstacles arranged alternatively in the passive mixer 
(required for reaching the mixing quality of 89.9%) does largely increase the flow resistance. 
Based on the defined non-dimensional parameter, mixing efficiency  , it is clearly shown in 
Table 1 that the mixing efficiency of 0.1768 for the current active mixer is superior to that of 
0.0005 for the passive mixer. This fact means that the active mixer can save much more pumping 
power than the passive mixer with the same mixing quality. The temperature produced by the 
active mixer as a result of Joule heating by the applied electrothermal field, and the maximum 
temperature rise in the fluid is about 3 K, which is considered as acceptable for physiological 
conditions. The higher temperature regions mostly are in between the electrode pairs as the AC 
voltage is applied. Figure 3 shows the average concentration of the cross sectional area at the 
middle height of the outlet for the three mixers. The profiles indicate that both the passive and 
 10 
consistently by some amount of distance (see Figure 8) to the right (i.e., the direction of the 
outlet). Figure 9 shows that the concentration profile is affected significantly by the arrangement 
patterns of asymmetric electrodes for Case (d), which yield virtually the best mixing quality 
among these four cases. It is found that asymmetric vortices, as shown in the streamline 
distribution of Figure 9, are induced by arrangement patterns of asymmetric electrodes so that the 
contact opportunity of two various samples increases to promote effectively the mixing, thus 
enhancing the mixing quality. Table 4 presents the corresponding mixing quality for all these four 
cases. As can be seen, the mixing quality is raised efficiently by the arrangement of asymmetric 
electrode pairs, except for Case (a)-(4), Case (b)-(5), Case (c)-(5) and Case (d)-(5), which can be 
attributed to the excessively relative distances between positive and negative electrodes. However, 
the mixing quality for Case (a)-(5) is higher than that for Case (a)-(4). The reason is as follows. 
For the Case (a)-(5), the interaction between the first positive electrode (from left to right) and the 
second negative electrode (from left to right) is strong. The vortices induced by electrothermal 
force are intensified and the mixing quality is enhanced. Figure 10 shows the velocity profile. For 
the design of symmetric electrodes patterns, two fluid streams are primarily mixed at the center 
region of the microfluidic channel, where the velocity profiles are symmetrically disturbed. On 
the other hand, for the design of asymmetric ones, two fluid streams are compelled to mix at the 
left, center or right side of the microfluidic channel in terms of vortices induced by asymmetric 
electrodes patterns. Contrasting the two cases, it is clearly seen that the mixing opportunity of 
two fluid streams is effectively prompted for the latter one. As for the temperature rise in the 
micro-mixer, the maximum temperature rise due to the electrothermal heating in the fluid still 
remain about 3 K for cases which have higher mixing quality, as shown in Figure 11.  
Comparison among the existing and our proposed electrothermal micromixers is presented below. 
Two characteristic time parameters, namely, the diffusion time d
t
 and convective time f
t
 of 
the micromixer and the ratio of these two time parameters , are introduced:

High inlet flow velocity, short flow channel, large width of flow channel and small diffusion 
coefficient all cause difficulty of mixing. Thus, the value   can serve as one of the performance

Immunoassay of Human Immunoglobulin Using Quartz Crystal 
Microbalance 
Sheng D. Chao 
Institute of Applied Mechanics, National Taiwan University, Taipei 106, Taiwan, ROC 
Abstract: We performed an immunoassay analysis using the Quartz Crystal 
Microbalance (QCM) biosensor to detect the specific binding reaction of the (Human 
IgG1)-(Anti-Human IgG1) protein pair. Both experimental and computational were 
used to study biomolecular binding reactions in microfluidic channels. We discussed the 
unsteady convective diffusion in the transportation tube and found that the distribution 
of the analyte concentration in the tube is strongly affected by the flow field. Due to this, 
large discrepancies between the simulations and experimental results were observed. We 
show that the conventional assumption of the uniform and steady analyte concentration 
used in the computational procedure is not accurate enough. In addition, we show that 
the commonly used procedure in kinetic analysis for estimating binding rate constants 
from the experimental data would underestimate these rate constants due to neglected 
diffusion processes from the inlet to the reaction surface. A modified procedure is 
proposed to supplement the kinetic analysis, thus yielding better consistency with 
experiments.
