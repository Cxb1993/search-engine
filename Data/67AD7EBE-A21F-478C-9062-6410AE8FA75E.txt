 damping ratio arising from the supplemental dampers. Obviously, both the amount of 
supplemental damping and the plan-wise placement of the viscous dampers, such as the 
dispersion of the viscous dampers and the distance between the center of supplemental 
damping (CSD) and the center of mass (CM), are influential to the seismic responses of 
asymmetric-plan buildings. In fact, the damping effects of the viscous dampers on the seismic 
responses of elastic single-story asymmetric-plan buildings have been extensively studied 
(Goel 1998; Lin and Chopra 2001). The reasons for the effects of the plan-wise distribution 
of viscous dampers on the seismic responses of elastic single-story asymmetric-plan 
buildings have also been discussed (Lin and Chopra 2001; Goel 2000). Although the complex 
eigenvalue analyses provide the exact information about the modal properties of the non-
proportionally damped buildings, the overall system parameters representing the amount and 
the plan-wise distribution of the added viscous dampers cannot be obtained from conducting 
this type of analyses. The overall system parameters are useful in developing a fundamental 
understanding of the resultant effects of the added viscous dampers. Hence, Goel (1998) 
characterized the supplemental damping in the single-story asymmetric-plan buildings with 
linear viscous dampers by using three overall system parameters. These three overall system 
parameters are (1) the supplemental damping ratio sd ; (2) the normalized supplemental 
damping eccentricity sde ; and (3) the normalized supplemental damping radius of 
gyration sd . Goel (1998) also conducted the parametric study on these three parameters, and 
provided the insights into the effects of the amount, the resultant location and the dispersion 
of the added dampers. Thus, practicing engineers can effectively gain the physical 
interpretation of the total installed viscous dampers in terms of these three overall system 
parameters for a single story asymmetrical building. Goel (1998) concluded that it is worthy 
of further investigation of multi-story asymmetrical buildings with supplemental viscous 
dampers. Nevertheless, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there seems still no way to 
characterize the overall system parameters representing the resultant effects of viscous 
dampers installed in the multi-story asymmetrical buildings. 
The response spectra constructed from the non-proportionally damped single-story 
asymmetrical buildings have been extensively used in investigating the effects of the 
supplemental damping on their seismic responses (Goel 1998; Lin and Chopra 2001). The 
abscissa and the ordinate of these response spectra respectively represent the uncoupled 
vibration periods, i.e. the purely translational period, and the peak responses of the single-
 The effective one-story building 
The two horizontal axes of the coordinate system used in this paper are the X- and the Z- 
axes. The direction of the Y-axis is opposite to the direction of gravity. For the sake of 
simplicity, the original N-story asymmetrical buildings are only symmetric about the X-axis 
and the ground motion is applied along the Z-axis. The subscripts z and  used in the 
following content refer to quantities related to the Z-translational and the Y-rotational 
components, respectively. The first translational-dominant and the first rotational-dominant 
vibration modes of the original building are chosen as the two targeted vibration modes to 
form the EOSB. That is to say, the two 2DOF modal systems representing the two vibration 
modes of the EOSB are the same as those representing the two targeted vibration modes of 
the original building. The mass, damping and stiffness matrices of the EOSB are respectively 
denoted as

Since m1+I1= m2+I2=1 (Lin and Tsai 2009) and choose 2 1m m  , Eq. 8 can be further 
simplified as 
 
(9) 
 
and Eq. 7 yields m1=I2 and m2=I1. Thus, the stiffness matrix of the EOSB is obtained as

and *** mIr  ; 1 and 2 are the undamped vibration frequencies of the two targeted 
vibration modes of the original building. The values of s1 and s2, which may be 1 or -1, are 
determined by investigating the two targeted undamped mode shapes of the original building. 
For example, if the signs of znφ and nφ , n=1, 2, are the same (schematically shown as Fig. 
2a), sn is equal to 1. Conversely, if the signs of znφ and nφ , n=1, 2, are opposite 
(schematically shown as Fig. 2b), sn is equal to -1. The damping matrix of the EOSB is 
assumed to be positively related to the 2DOF modal damping matrix of the lower vibration 
mode among the two targeted vibration modes of the original building. That is,

 similarly-stiff (TSS) and torsionally-flexible (TF) asymmetric-plan buildings. The third 
example is the variation of the SAC 20-story building located in Los Angeles (Krawinkler 
2000). The main purpose of the third example is to see the applicability of the proposed 
approach to high-rise buildings, which may have significant higher mode effects. The 
detailed properties of these three example buildings can be found in the related literatures 
(Lin and Tsai 2007b; Ahlawat and Ramaswamy 2003; Kan and Chopra 1977; Krawinkler 
2000). 
Example 1 
Table 1a shows the mass, damping and stiffness matrices of the single-story example 
building (Fig. 3). The damping coefficient Cz of the linear viscous damper installed along the 
Z-axis (Fig. 3) is equal to 2mzsd, in which ωz is the transverse vibration circular frequency. 
The supplemental damping ratios, sd, used in this building is equal to 30%. Table 1b shows 
the modal properties and the transformed damping matrix, which has non-zero off-diagonal 
elements. The properties of the two 2DOF modal systems for this single-story asymmetrical 
building are shown in Table 1c. Table 2 shows the properties of the EOSB computed by using 
Eqs. 10, 14 and 16. Note that Eq. 16 is the equation of motion corresponding to the 
displacement vector defined as  Tz uru ***  . It was found that the properties shown in Table 2 
are the same as those shown in Table 1a except the latter is 9.45 times the former and the 
latter is presented corresponding to the displacement vector defined as  Tz uu  . It indicates 
that the EOSB is identical to the original building when the original building happens to be 
single-story. Therefore, this confirms the accuracy of the derivation for Eqs. 10 and 14. 
Moreover, Table 2 shows that the supplemental damping properties of this example building 
are sd = 0.277, sde = 2.16 and sd = 0. 
Example 2 
The translational and rotational stiffness of each floor of the corresponding symmetrical 
8-story building are 4.503105 kN/m and 3.84107 kN-m/rad, respectively. The center of 
rigidity (CR) is at the geometric center of the floor plan and the center of mass (CM) is 6m 
away from the CR in the positive direction along the X-axis, yielding an eccentricity ratio 
equal to 25%. The 88 stiffness sub-matrices, i.e. kzz, kz and k, of these three example 
buildings are shown in Table 3a. The story mass of the 3rd to the 8th story of these three 
 TSS and TF is about 51:1:3 , which is the ratio of the inverse square root of the mass 
moment of inertia between these three example buildings. Thus, it implies that the proposed 
EOSB can appropriately present the properties of the original buildings. 
Example 3 
The 20-story example building (Fig. 7), denoted as Building ASY20, is a variation of the 
symmetrical 20-story building located in Los Angeles investigated in the SAC steel research 
project. Each floor is simulated as a rigid diaphragm with a lumped mass at the CM. The CR 
is at the geometric center. The CM was moved away from the CR in the negative X-direction, 
yielding an eccentricity ratio of -20%. The flexible side (FS) is defined as one of the two Z-
directional sides closer to the CM. The other side opposite to the FS is the stiff side (SS). The 
first translational-dominant and the first rotational-dominant vibration modes are the 1st and 
the 2nd vibration modes of the 20-story example building, respectively. Rayleigh damping 
with 2% damping ratios for these two vibration modes was assumed to represent the inherent 
damping. The same ground motion record as that used in Example 2 was applied to this 20-
story example building in the Z-direction. Elastic response history analysis was performed. 
There were 20 linear viscous dampers with a damping coefficient equal to 5104 kNsec/m 
arbitrarily installed in the Z-directional bays shown as Fig. 7b. In detail, at each of the 1st, 5th, 
8th, 10th, 13th, 15th and 17th floors, there is a viscous damper installed on the FS. For each of 
the other floors, there is a viscous damper installed on the SS. The vibration frequencies of 
the two targeted vibration modes are 1.61 rad./sec and 3.26 rad./sec. The effective modal 
participation mass ratios of the two targeted vibration modes are 78.21% and 3.1%. Moreover, 
the ratios of the effective modal participation mass moment of inertia for the two targeted 
vibration modes are 3.17% and 78.5%. Thus, considering the two targeted vibration modes of 
Building ASY20 has the accumulated mass and mass moment of inertia about equal to 81%. 
The properties of the two 2DOF modal systems representing the two targeted vibration 
modes of Building ASY20 are shown in Table 5. Table 6 shows the properties of the EOSB 
for Building ASY20. The translational and the rotational response histories at the 20th and the 
10th floor of Building ASY20 are shown in Fig. 8. In general, Fig. 8 shows the estimated 
responses were satisfactory, except the amplitudes of the few cycles shown in Fig. 8c. 
Furthermore, Fig. 9 shows that the estimated translational response on the two sides at the 
20th floor, which includes the influence of the estimated rotational response (Fig. 8c), is still 
acceptable. 
 Eqs. 5, 16a and the previous study (Lin and Tsai 2007b), the responses of the EOSB can be 
approximately expressed as: 
 
 (18) 
 
where *zn , n=1~2, are the modal participation factors of the nth vibration mode of the EOSB; 
*
znD ,
*
nD , n=1~2, are the 2DOF modal responses of the nth vibration mode of the EOSB. 
Remind that the EOSB is constructed from the two targeted 2DOF modal systems of the 
original multi-story building. Hence, the two modal responses of the EOSB are the same as 
the modal responses of the first translational-dominant and the first rotational-dominant 
vibration modes the original multi-story building, i.e. znzn DD 
*  nn DD  
* , n=1~2. Assume 
that the mode shapes of the first translational-dominant and the first rotational-dominant 
vibration modes of the original multi-story building are triangular, i.e. 
 
(19) 
 
where the subscript r (Eq. 19) represents the roof component. Note that the nth mode shape 
shown in Eq. 19 is normalized to have the nth modal mass equal to one. Thus, the mn and In, 
n=1~2, defined in Eq. 3, can be approximated as: 
(20) 
 
Substituting Eqs. 20 and znzn DD 
* , nn DD  
* , n=1~2, into Eq. 18 results in 
 
(21) 
 
If the radius of gyration r of the floors of the original multi-story building is constant, Eq. 21 
can be further simplified as:

 Note that the z has no unit and the unit of  is the inverse of length. Obviously, the use of 
the EOSB in predicting the roof displacements of the original multi-story building, i.e. only 
considering the two targeted vibration modes of the original building, may be insufficient for 
buildings with significant higher modes’ effect. Note that the higher modes’ effect also 
depends on the frequency contents of the ground motions. In addition, it is well known that 
the higher modes have more effect on the base shear than the floor displacements. Thus, the 
application of the EOSB in predicting the structural responses, where the higher modes play 
an important role, needs further investigation. 
Numerical examples 
Buildings TS, TSS and TF were used as the example buildings to verify the accuracy of 
applying the response spectra constructed from the EOSB to estimate their peak roof 
responses, including the peak roof translational and rotational displacements. The selected 
ground motion records are the set of 20 ground motions records (Table 7) with a return 
period of 475 years, which was used in the SAC steel research project for buildings located in 
Los Angeles (Krawinkler 2000). By using the contents given in Table 4, the properties of the 
EOSBs for Buildings TS, TSS and TF are shown in Table 8. These properties include the 
translational vibration period Tz, the inherent damping ratio , the normalized 
eccentricitye and the frequency ratio TTz . Table 8 also shows the values of z and . 
Using the values of , e ,  (Table 8) and the values of the supplemental damping properties 
sd, sde and sd (Table 4), the response spectra of the EOSBs were constructed shown in Fig. 
10. The spectral values *dzS and
*
dS  (Fig. 10), corresponding to the translational vibration 
periods of Buildings TS, TSS and TF, multiplied by z and  , respectively, are shown in 
Table 9. Table 9 also shows the exact peak roof responses dzS and dS of the original multi-
story buildings and the corresponding estimation errors. Table 9 shows that the means of the 
estimation errors are between 3.8% and 13.4%; the coefficients of variation (CV) for the 
estimation errors are between 0.23 and 1.61. The positive and the negative estimation errors 
(Table 9) indicate that the estimated peak roof responses are on the conservative side and the 
un-conservative side, respectively. Table 9 shows that most of the estimations are on the 
conservative side. Furthermore, Fig. 11 shows the comparison of the estimated and the exact 
peak roof responses. Specifically, Fig. 12 shows the estimated and the exact roof response 
histories of these three example buildings subjected to the excitation of the LA02 (Table 7) 
 displacements of three non-proportionally damped 8-story example buildings subjected to 20 
seismic ground motions. However, it is worthy to note in the EOSB that only two vibration 
modes of the original building are considered in estimating the seismic responses of the 
original building. The method of including the higher modes’ effect needs further research. 
As indicated above, the EOSB can be used in describing the overall supplemental 
damping properties, and conveniently applied in constructing the response spectrum for non-
proportionally damped multi-story asymmetrical buildings. Other applications of the EOSB 
have been studied. For example, the optimal locations of the added dampers in a multi-story 
asymmetrical building can be determined from analyzing the frequency response functions of 
the corresponding EOSBs (Bui 2011). Extending the applications of the EOSB for the 
inelastic multi-story asymmetrical buildings is currently under investigation.
