二、英文摘要 
We propose the new Pd/Al0.3Ga0.7As MOS 
and MS Schottky diode hydrogen sensors. The 
hydrogen response characteristics and sensing 
properties of catalytic Pd/Al0.3Ga0.7As 
metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) and 
metal-semiconductor (MS) Schottky diodes are 
systematically studied. The effects of hydrogen 
adsorption on device performances such as the 
current-voltage characteristics, sensitivity, 
barrier height variation, heat of adsorption, and 
transient response are investigated. The studied 
devices can be operated under very wide 
hydrogen concentration regimes with 
remarkable hydrogen-sensing properties. 
Particularly, at an extremely low hydrogen 
concentration of 15 ppm H2/air, both 
state-steady and transient responses at room 
temperature can be detected. In addition, under 
the presence of oxide layer in the studied MOS 
device, the larger change of barrier height and 
higher hydrogen response are observed. In 
addition, according to the van’t Hoff equation, 
the initial heat values of adsorption for 
Pd/semiconductor and Pd/oxide interface are be 
calculated. The key merits associated with an 
AlGaAs material includes the relatively large 
energy band-gap (e.g., 1.8 eV of Al0.3Ga0.7As), 
high reactivity with oxygen and lattice-matched 
to GaAs. The studied hydrogen sensor exhibits 
the advantages of high hydrogen detection 
sensitivity, low detection limit, short response 
time, and relatively wide operation temperature 
regime. 
 
三、計劃緣由與目的 
Based on the MOS structure, a variety of 
semiconductor devices have been reported to 
sense different gases, such as carbon monoxide, 
ammonia and hydrogen etc. Due to the 
significant potentiality for scaling down of 
device size, semiconductor-type sensors have

shows the schematics of Pd/AlGaAs MOS and 
MS Schottky diodes. For hydrogen adsorption 
and desorption measurement, the studied 
devices were placed in a closed stainless-steel 
reaction chamber connected to a gas flow tube 
with a regulating valve. Hydrogen gases with 
different concentrations of 15, 48, 97, 202, 537, 
1010, 4940, and 9090ppmH2/air were 
employed in this study. The chamber was 
maintained in one atmosphere condition and 
the continuous and stable gas flowing with a 
500sccm flow rate was led through the 
chamber. 
 
五、實驗結果與討論 
Figures 3 and 4 show the current–voltage 
(I-V) characteristics of studied Pd/AlGaAs MS 
and MOS Schottky diodes exposed to air and to 
hydrogen concentrations of 15, 537 and 
9090ppm H2/air at 70℃. Upon exposing to 
hydrogen, both the forward and reverse 
currents are substantially increased with 
increasing the hydrogen concentration. The 
current variation of MOS structure is large than 
that of MS Schottky diode. This is attributed to 
the reduction of the leakage current resulting 
from the improved interface properties under 
the presence of interficial oxide layer [15]. As 
the surface state density is reduced 
considerably, the influence of pinning effect 
becomes relatively negligible. As shown in Fig. 
3, at a fixed forward of 0.2V, the forward 
current is increased from 1.81×10-9A (in air) to 
1.46×10-7A (9090ppm H2/air) and a reverse 
voltage of –0.2 V, the reverse current is 
decreased from 1.9×10-11A (in air) and 
6.47×10-10A (9090ppm H2/air). Obviously, the 
studied hydrogen sensors can be applied under 
bi-directional biases which is another important 
evaluation of commercial use for the hydrogen 
sensor.  Both of the studied devices exhibit 
remarkable hydrogen detecting capability of 
wide hydrogen concentration. Figures 5 and 6 
show the I-V characteristics of studied 
Pd/AlGaAs MS and MOS Schottky diodes 
exposed to air and to hydrogen concentrations 
of 15, 537 and 9090 ppm H2/air at 95℃. As the 
temperature is elevated, the turn-on voltage and 
current response variation of both devices are 
decreased. This is caused by the decrease of 
barrier height induced by the dipole layer 
which leads to the increase of carriers across 
the Schottky junction.  
Figures 7 and 8 reveal the hydrogen detection 
sensitivity S as a function of hydrogen 
concentration in air with different operating 
temperature of Pd/AlGaAs MOS and MS 
Schottky diode hydrogen sensors, respectively. 
The applied forward voltage of both studied 
devices are fixed at VF=0.35 V. The hydrogen 
detection sensitivity S is defined as: 
air
airH
I

S
−= 2
 
where IH2 and Iair are currents measured under 
hydrogen-containing ambient and air, 
respectively. High sensitivities of 155.9 and 
0.99 in the 9090 and 15 ppm H2/air are 
obtained at room temperature for MOS-type 
structure, respectively. On the other hand, the 
sensitivity of MS-type structure under the same 
condition is only 5.11 (9090ppm H2/air) and 
0.2 (15ppm H2/air). This high sensitivity of 
MOS-structure is directly attributed to the 
presence of the oxide layer in the studied 
device which results in better interfacial 
properties. As the temperature is elevated, the 
sensitivity values are reduced with increasing 
the temperature and reducing the hydrogen 
concentration. 
Figure 9 illustrates the Schottky barrier 
height φb as a function of hydrogen 
concentration for studied Pd/AlGaAs MS and 
MOS Schottky diodes. Clearly, from Fig. 9, 
under the hydrogen-contained ambient, the 
Pd-MOS Schottky diode exhibits a relatively 
larger reduction magnitude of φb than Pd-MS 
Schottky diode. It is known that, under the 
presence of interfacial oxide layer, the Schottky 
barrier height is enhanced [16]. The inset of Fig. 
9 shows the schematic diagram of 
corresponding hydrogen adsorption. It’s

diffusion coefficients. The data extracted from 
the van’s Hoff equation indicate both of the 
studied devices are exothermic reaction which 
also can be explained why the hydrogen 
sensitivity is decreased with increasing the 
operating temperature, 
六、結論 
In summary, the new Pd/AlGaAs 
hydrogen sensors based on the MOS and MS 
Schottky diodes have been fabricated and 
demonstrated. The hydrogen adsorption 
performance in the steady-state and the 
transient response are compared and analyzed 
under atmospheric conditions. The studied 
devices exhibit significantly wide operating 
hydrogen concentration regimes. Even at 30℃ 
and low hydrogen concentration of 15ppm 
H2/air, the remarkable hydrogen detection can 
be observed. Under the presence of oxide layer 
in the device structure, the hydrogen detection 
sensitivity and current variation are improved. 
From the van’t Hoff equation, the values of 
heat of hydrogen adsorption are 200 and 
365eV/atom for the studied MS and MOS-type 
devices, respectively. These values confirm that 
hydrogen atoms populated at the interface 
between Pd metal and oxide layer causes the 
improved hydrogen detection characteristics of 
MOS type structure.

reversibility, (iii) high sensitivity, (iv) fast 
response, and (v) wide temperature operation 
regime. Due to its mature techniques, the 
Si-based hydrogen sensor, produced by a 
metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) structure 
with a catalytic metal, was first reported by 
Lundström et al [1]. However, the Si-based 
devices exhibit lower sensitivity, larger 
response time and can’t be operated under 
higher temperature environments. In order to 
fabricate more sensitive hydrogen sensing 
devices, Schottky diodes based on compound 
semiconductors have been studied and reported 
[2-7]. InP-based Schottky diode exhibits good 
performances of high hydrogen detectivity and 
short response time. However, these sensors are 
only suitable to be operated at lower 
temperature regimes [8]. SiC-based Schottky 
diode was reported to present 
hydrogen-sensitive performances even the 
temperature is elevated above 450oC. Yet, the 
detection capability is reduced under lower 
operating temperature and lower hydrogen 
concentration [4, 9]. It is known that, the 
AlGaAs-based Schottky diode is an alternative 
candidate for hydrogen detection due to its 
good performances of high detection sensitivity, 
short response time and wide operation 
temperature regime [10]. In this work, a new 
hydrogen sensor, based on an AlGaAs high 
electron mobility transistor (HEMT) with a 
catalytic palladium metal-oxide-semiconductor 
(Pd-MOS) Schottky structure, is fabricated and 
studied. The studied device exhibits the 
advantages of high hydrogen detection 
sensitivity, low concentration limitation of 
hydrogen detection, shorter response time and 
wide operation temperature regime. 
Furthermore, based on the significant transistor 
and sensor actions, the studied device provides 
the promise for practical integrated circuit (IC) 
and micro electro-mechanical system (MEMS) 
applications. 
 
四、研究方法 
The studied PHEMT hydrogen sensor was 
grown by metal organic chemical vapor 
deposition (MOCVD) on a (100) oriented 
semi-insulated (S.I.) GaAs substrate. The 
epitaxial structure consisted of a 5000 Å-thick 
GaAs undoped buffer layer, a 150 Å-thick 
undoped In0.15Ga0.85As channel layer, a 45 
Å-thick undoped Al0.24Ga0.76As spacer, a Si 
planar-doped layer with the doping 
concentration of 4×1012 cm-2, a 200 Å-thick 
n-Al0.24Ga0.76As (n=3×1017 cm-3) Schottky 
layer, and a 600Å-thick n+-GaAs (n+=2×1018 
cm-3) cap layer. Figure 1 depicts the schematic 
cross-section of the studied device. After 
epitaxial growth, wet chemical etching, 
conventional photolithography, thermal 
evaporation, lift-off and rapid thermal 
annealing (RTA) techniques were used to 
define electrode patterns and fabricate the 
device. For device isolation, the mesa etching 
was first employed to etch the samples into the 
substrate with an H3PO4:H2O2:H2O (1:1:20) 
solution at room temperature. Then, the 
drain-source Ohmic contacts were formed on 
the n+-GaAs cap layer by evaporating 
Au/Ge/Ni metals and alloyed at 380oC for 20 
seconds. In the gate oxide process, the native 
oxide was first removed by the solution of 
HF:H2O=1:1, and then the samples were put 
into the oven with O2 flow at 360oC for 25 
minutes to form the desired oxide layer. Finally, 
the gate Schottky contacts were achieved by 
depositing the catalytic Pt metal on the thin 
oxide layer. The used gate dimension was 
1.4x100 μm2. Hydrogen gases with different 
concentrations of 15, 97, 1010 and 9090 ppm 
H2/air were employed in this work. 
 
五、實驗結果與討論 
The typical common-source output 
current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the 
studied device under different-concentration 
hydrogen gases at 30, 92, and 160oC are shown 
in Fig. 2. Clearly, all I-V curves show good 
pinch-off and saturation characteristics. As

agreement with the previous reports[14]. 
It is known that, the AlGaAs-based 
Schottky diodes exhibit high detection 
sensitivity in hydrogen sensing characteristics 
[15]. However, the hydrogen sensing area of 
catalytic metals is a key role for hydrogen 
adsorption which directly relates to the 
magnitude of developed dipole moments and 
modulation in Schottky barrier height [16]. By 
considering the impact of hydrogen sensing 
area, an effective sensitivity  deduced from 
the saturation sensitivity, can be defined as:

the effective sensitivity and hydrogen 
concentration at 30

S ′
oC are illustrated in Fig. 6. 
For comparison, the previously reported 
AlGaAs-based MOS and MS Schottky diodes 
with Pd or Pt catalytic gate metal are also 
included in Fig. 6. Under the hydrogen 
concentrations of 15, 98, 1010, and 9090ppm 
H2/air, the corresponding values of the 
studied device are 2.13x10
S ′
4, 5.69x104, 
1.24x105, and 2.14x105 cm-2, respectively. 
Clearly, these values are superior to those of 
AlGaAs-based Schottky diodes. This may be 
related to the transistor amplification action. 
Figure 7 shows the temperature dependence of 
effective sensitivity under different 
hydrogen concentrations at the bias conditions 
of V
S ′
DS=1V and VGS=0V. Clearly, the S ′values 
are increased and decreased with increasing the 
hydrogen concentration and operating 
temperature, respectively. 
The potential energy change, ΔV, caused 
by the presented dipolar layer is determined by 
the hydrogen coverage at the interface, 
s
inpV εΔ
×=  (3) 
where p is the equivalent dipole moment 
induced by the adsorbed hydrogen atoms at the 
interface, ni the amount of adsorbed atoms per 
unit area or adsorbed sites at Pt-oxide interface, 
and εs the dielectric permittivity of 
Al0.24Ga0.76As. The relationship between the 
interface adsorbed sites ni and operating 
temperature under different-concentration 
hydrogen gases is shown in Fig. 8. It is known 
that, the ni is approximately linearly decreased 
with the increase of temperature. In addition, it 
is also increased with increasing the hydrogen 
concentration. At room temperature, the 
maximum ni value of cm131058.1 × -2 is 
obtained under the 9970 ppm H2/air gas. In 
order to study the hydrogen detection 
mechanism, the effects of oxygen species in the 
sensing environment on Pt surface should be 
considered. Due to the presence of oxygen at Pt 
surface, the adsorbed hydrogen and oxygen 
atoms interact to form hydroxyl and water. 
These surface O and OH species will limit the 
adsorption of hydrogen from the gas phase. 
This product rate becomes more violent at 
higher operating temperature. In other words, 
hydrogen atoms may be trapped easily by 
oxygen on the Pt surface at higher temperature. 
 
In order to study the hydrogen adsorption 
characteristics, the coverage of hydrogen at 
interface θi can be expressed as:

where K is a temperature-dependent 
equilibrium constant which is depends on the 
difference of adsorption between at the surface 
and interface. and are the partial 
pressures of hydrogen and oxygen, respectively.

where ΔVth,max is the maximum threshold 
voltage shift. Substituting Eq. (5) into (4) 
yields

Schottky contact is fabricated and demonstrated. 
The steady-state and transition responses 
exhibit high hydrogen detection capability. In 
addition, the studied device exhibits remarkable 
hydrogen detection sensitivities in 
three-terminal transistor characteristics as 
exposing to hydrogen-contained environments. 
The main reason of gas response has been 
identified as the modulation in gate potential. 
The negative value of enthalpy represents that 
the hydrogen adsorption on Pt−MOS PHEMT 
interface is an exothermic reaction. Therefore, 
the decrease of hydrogen detection ability with 
increasing the temperature can be expected. 
The studied device shows good hydrogen 
detection ability especially at low temperature. 
The fast transient responses of the studied 
device offer the potentiality for microsensor 
fabrication. Therefore, the studied device 
shows the promise for hydrogen sensor and 
PHEMT integrated circuit applications.

一、參加會議經過 
第37屆歐洲固態元件研討會 (37th European Solid-State Device Research 
Conference, 37th ESSDERC) 是由慕尼黑科技大學 (Technical University 
Munich)主辦，這項會議舉行之日期為 9 月 11 日至 9 月 13 日。本屆會議共
發表了九十六篇口頭報告論文，其中包含五篇邀請演講報告論文，內容涵蓋
所有固態材料、固態元件、固態科學、固態技術與應用領域之研究，諸如：
可靠度 (Reliability) 、多閘極元件 (Multigate Devices) 、多重微縮分析
(Multi-Scale Analysis)、深次微米技術(Deep Sub-Micron Technologies)、雜訊
和效能評估(Noise & Performance Assessment)、高介電值及金屬閘極(High-k 
& Metal Gates)、相位改變和電阻式記憶體(Phase Change and Resistive 
Memory)、碳系列元件 (Carbon-based Devices)、先進製程整合 (Advanced 
Process Integration)、先進特性技術(Advanced Characterization Techniques)、
矽新興元件(Silicon Emerging Devices)、扭變元件(Strained Devices)、靜態與
Resistor-type sensor 等研製已逾十餘年，經由 MBE，MOCVD 等磊晶成長之
材料系統如 AlGaAs/GaAs，GaAs/InGaP，AlInAs/GaInAs，InP/InGaAs…等也
皆有一定之基礎，參加這次會議除了發表自己的研究成果外，也是想吸收他
人的長處，尤其是在元件結構之設計上若能得到別人新穎而確實可行的創
意，則對日後自己的研究必會大有助益。綜觀此次會場內之論文，各種材料
系統之元件，雖是琳瑯滿目，但真正屬於創意的作品並不多，或許在各種材
料系統之發展上或多或少的存在著現階段仍難克服的瓶頸。僅管如此，筆者
還是看到不少材料系統的組合應用與元件結構設計上均是受益匪淺。另外，
筆者藉參與此次會議在德國交流訪問約一個星期，期間對德國人做事一板一
眼、一絲不苟的態度，留下極為深刻之印象。在德期間，筆者赫然發現整整
7~8 天之行程，德國無論上自高速公路，下至鄉間小道，竟然全都是平整順
暢，筆者費盡心機想找出一條具有坑洞之道路，竟然是無功而返，這與我們
所熟悉的台灣道路，幾乎每條都有坑坑洞洞之事實，實在令人感慨萬千。國
家、人民之競爭力，光由此一小細節，即可立判高下。 
建議 
光電與微電子為我國列為重點發展的兩項科技，事實上以國人的聰明與
勤勞也極適合這兩項科技的發展，歷年來，政府也投入不少相關的經費，目
的就是希望能維持這兩項科技，產業於一流的水準。但是這兩項科技皆是進
步迅速，日新月異的技術，稍一不慎即有可能被潮流所淘汰，必須督促研究
者與生產者，不停地吸收新知，戳力以赴，才有可能與世界潮流並駕齊驅。
