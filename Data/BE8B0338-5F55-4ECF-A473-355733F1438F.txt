1 Introduction
Sliding mode control (SMC), a high-speed
switching feedback control methodology, has
received much attention both in theory and
applications for the last decades. Generally,
one of its salient features is known to be its
robustness against uncertainties both in
system parameters and dynamics [1][2].
However, one of the major drawbacks of the
sliding mode control is the adverse chatters
while the controller input undergoes very fast
activity of switching. Nevertheless most SMC
designs prove its efficacy in maintaining both
stability and robust performance in
counteracting modeling imprecision and
external disturbances as well. The chatters can
always be alleviated by the so-called
boundary layer approach [5], in which the
discontinuous control activity is replaced by a
continuous control effort inside a preset
boundary layer around the switching surface.
However, its robust performance would
inevitably be deteriorated with this augmented
boundary-layer. In general, the layer thickness
or width is either fixed or time invariant,
tradeoffs between alleviated chatters and
robust performance could highly depend on
the choice of layer thickness. Physically
speaking, the boundary layer can be
approximated as a low-pass filter for a high
frequency switching output, the cut-off
frequency of this filter would be very difficult
to be determined, however. In [6], the
controller design adopted physical properties
of a robot manipulator and a set of
time-varying switching gains and boundary
layer are incorporated in the sliding mode
controller to accelerate the state trajectories
moving toward the sliding hyper-plane, the
design turned out to be much complicated and
the system dynamics must be known as a
priori. A state-dependent boundary layer
approach were proposed by [7][8], in which
the thickness of boundary layer can be
adjusted online based-on the state norm for a
class of uncertain linear systems. On the other
hand, aimed at nonlinear systems, a
mode-switching control (MSC) scheme is
usually adopted to improve the accuracy and
robustness of controller design. In [3], Iwasaki,
Sakai and Matsui applied the MSC in a
two-degree-of -freedom position control
system to achieve both fast response and high
accuracy. And Takashi, Hidehiko and Hiromu
[4] proposed the MSC with initial value
compensation to determine the optimal
switching conditions for the disk drives. In[9],
different SMC schemes based on mode
switching was reported, it is noted that
difficulties were encountered in the
compromising between compatibility and
robustness while mode switching took place.
This paper is aimed to propose a
mode-switching sliding-mode control (MSMC)
scheme that combines different SMC schemes
to alleviate adverse effect while achieving
precise control task. Here, both compatibility
and robustness are resolved by a
state-dependent boundary layer based-on
disturbance observer design incorporated with
MSMC is proposed. This proposed scheme
can estimate uncertainties by a disturbance
observer and then utilize it to calculate the
thickness/width of the boundary layer on-line.
Finally, to demonstrate the efficacy and
feasibility of the proposed method, a maglev
platform with a two-DOF is devised to
validate the proposed schemes through
experiment studies.
which implies that one cannot ensure ISMC
will t switching back to SMC, while 2 I  ,
ISMC will converge to Iq ~0 provided
that no disturbance is encounter.
Consequently, It is concluded that if 2 I  ,
sliding variable will encounter compatibility
problem while switching occurs between
s  and Is . Instead of switching
based on the sliding variable, for n=2, the
mode-switching condition needs to be
modified as follows [9].

Here st is the pre-specified time of switching,

switching occurs. The choice of thickness will
affect the robustness As described by [7], a
state-dependent boundary layer control is
capable of ensuring effective chattering
alleviation with state-dependent uncertainties
but the adverse effect of external disturbances
still exist, in other words, ineffective
switching might occur on (9) without a better
estimation on the bounds of disturbances.
3 A State-Dependent Boundary Layer
with Disturbance Observer
As shown in Fig. 1, consider the dynamic
system as described in (1), we wish to track a
desired command qd(t), a pole-placement
design using feedback- linearization technique
leads to the following control law[10].

Assuming that boundary layer Φcan be

Since 1cK and 2cK are positive constants, if
the perturbation is bounded, then the
state-dependent boundary based on
disturbance observer is bounded and
asymptotically stable is assured.
Remark: The thickness of boundary layer
p is the filter output of the system
perturbationthrough an over-damped second
order low-pass filter with pre-specified
bandwidth. Accordingly, even if  is with
high-frequency content or with discontinuous
jump, only low-frequency part of will be
less attenuated. Furthermore,  can be
estimated from ˆ , and a bounded  is
assured.
4 Experimental Studies
4.1 The Experimental Setup [9]
As shown in Fig. 2, a two-D.O.F maglev
platform under study consists of two
electromagnets Mzl and Mzr withμr = 6000 and
area of pole-face equals to 4.05 mm2 wounded
with 700 turns of coil to levitate the platform.
For each electromagnet poles, both equipped
with an optical-sensor which is manufactured
by MTI Instrument with the probe having the
capability of emitting a light to the surface and
receiving the projection with a sensitivity of
0.868 mm/V and a linear range of 2 mm with a
bandwidth of 140 KHz to measure its
corresponding air gaps. The signals were then
send to a Pentium PC through a 12-bit high
speed A/D converter with a conversion rate at
90K samples/sec and conversion range of 10
volt. The control law was implemented using
C-language at a sampling rate of 1ms.The
control effort was then send out through a D/A
converter with the conversion rate at 15 K
samples/sec, and a range of 0 to 5 volt to a
current source with current gain equals to 2

4.2 Experimental Studies
Experiments were performed to verify the
proposed scheme, which utilizes mode-
switching between SMC and ISMC with
disturbance observer. We specified the
switching time set at t=0.05 sec,
mmZ c 2.0)05.0(
~  and mrad5.0)50.0(~  as zand
 in Eq.(20) for vertical displacement and
pitch angle. Therefore, we would have the
design parameters for the two SMCs, i.e.
For z-direction :
1sec6.37 z , 1sec8.18 zI
For pitch angle:
-1sec28.2 , -1sec14.1I
Case 1: Fixed boundary layer and switching
region
From Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, SMC can obtain
satisfactory settling time, while it enters the
boundary layer, there exists a significant
steady-state error, however. It is noted that
while entering the switching region which is
set at t=0.05 sec, ISMC has demonstrated its
efficacy in reducing the steady state error, but
it requires longer settling time and larger
overshoot that will inevitably cause integral
wind-up. It is seen that the response in pitch
angle experienced a much violent vibration
than that of vertical displacement. The
mode-switching sliding mode has
demonstrated its capability in the application
on this Maglev platform but with the price of
the fine tuning of proper switching region.

(Φz= 7.515 mm-sec-1) (Vertical displacement).
Fig. 4. MSMC with fixed boundary layer
(  =14.085 mrad-sec
-1). (Pitch angle)
Case 2: State-dependent boundary layer
With the disturbance observer added for the
MSMC scheme, based on Eq.(32) and Eq.(33),
let Kc1 =Kc2 =188 sec-1 which is based on the
uncertain bounds of system. The
experimental results on both vertical and
rotational responses are compared with their
counterparts in Case 1 with the same control
laws. From Fig. 5, it is seen that with
augmented disturbance observer, a faster settle
time and smaller steady-state error were
achieved. And the switching region is also
time-varying due to its state-dependent nature
but tuned automatically. The state-trajectory
of vertical displacement would be constrained
inside the state-dependent boundary layer as
expected. On the other hand, the response of
pitch angle is also shown in Fig. 6, it is noted
