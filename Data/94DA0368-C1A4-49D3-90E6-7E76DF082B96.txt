heat transfer of nanofluids made of γ-Al2O3 and 
de-ionized water, flowing through a copper tube in the 
laminar flow regime. An experimental system was built by 
Xuan and Li [12] to investigate convective heat transfer 
and flow features of the nanofluids in a tube. Both the 
convective heat transfer coefficient and friction factor of 
the sample nanofluids for turbulent flow was measured, 
respectively. Khanafer et al. [13] was the first to 
investigate the problem of buoyancy-driven heat transfer 
enhancement of nanofluids in a two-dimensional 
enclosure. 
In this paper, transient heat transfer analysis of 
two-dimensional nanofluid channel flow is conducted to 
investigate the transport between nanofluid flow and 
channel configurations. Rib turbulators are aligned on the 
internal top surface of a channel, as shown in Fig. 1, and 
the ethylene-glycol (EG) based copper nanofluid is used 
for heat transfer enhancement. The COMSOL 
MULTIPHYSICS 3.2 package is used to do the numerical 
analysis. Results such as the highest decay rate, the 
lowest temperature, and temperature distributions of the 
top-plate surface of a freezing chucker are shown.

PROBLEM FORMULATION 
    The thermal fluid flow considered in the present 
study is steady and laminar in a hydrodynamically and 
thermally fully developed region of a two-dimensional 
channel. Figure 1 displays the physical configuration of a 
freezing-chucker. In the present analysis, Cartesian 
coordinates system will be applied to the channel. The 
viscous dissipation and compressibility effects in the 
energy equation are neglected. Consider the nanofluid in 
a two-dimensional channel of height H and length L, the 
nanofluid is Newtonian, incompressible, and laminar, and 
is assume to have uniform shape and size. Moreover, it is 
assumed that both fluid phase and nano-particles are in 
thermal equilibrium state. Based upon these assumptions, 
the equations of continuity, conservation of momentum, 
and conservation of energy are expressed in following 
forms,

To take the effect of thermal dispersion into account,

This expression is for the flow in the channel. To analyze 
the enhancement effect of stationary heat transfer of the 
nanofluid, the local Nusselt number and the mean

where hD is the equivalent diameter of the channel, ( )wT x is 
the wall temperature, ( )bT x is the bulk temperature of the 
nanofluid at a cross-section. Similar to the procedure 
introduced by Nield and Bejan [14], in their book, the 
dimensionless analysis of eqn. (14) for a tube formally 
results in the heat transfer correlation of the nanofluid as 
[7] 
*[1 (0)] (0) Ren mxNu C Pe f θ′ ′= +       (15) 
where Pe=Re*Pr, the exponent m and n depend upon the 
flow pattern, and dimensionless velocity f and 
dimensionless temperature θ may be defined according 
to the case of application. This expression clearly 
indicates that heat transfer enhancement of the nanofluid 
increases with the Peclet number. For the transient 
nanofluid channel flow, the Nusselt number is evaluated 
for each instant of time like in eqn. (14). 
Chou [15] presents an invention relates to a freezing 
sucker which will be frozen and defrosted quickly. An 
object of this invention is to provide a freezing sucker 
which freezes a bottom of a working article in order to 
hold the working article without magnet. By transferring 
latent heat of small amount of water from the top surface 
into the nanofluid flow in the channel, a decaying flux, 
0( )
atq t q e−=                 (16) 
is assumed to modeling the solidification of water on the 
top plate surface of this chucker. In eqn. (16), constant a 
is a factor corresponding to the transferring rate 
enhanced by thermoelectric cooler. In this study, we set 
a=1 and the influences of this factor will be discussed in 
another paper. In eqn. (16), 20 4716 (W/m )q = which 
means the latent heat transport from a small amount of 
water uniformly sprayed over the entire top plate surface 
and solidified by the freezing chucker. The bottom 
surface is assumed to be insulated. Flow rate of 1 L/min 
is flow through the channel from the inlet at the left hand 
side to the exhaust at the right hand side. The initial 
conditions of temperature is set to be 0℃ and velocity u 
is set to unit everywhere inside the channel, respectively. 
Investigations are focus on the temperature decay rate 
and the lowest temperature on the top-plate surface of a 
freezing chucker. Typical requirements on these 
specifications are: decay rate > 2℃/sec; lowest 
temperature < -20℃。 These two specifications may 
achieve by the enhancement of heat transfer by copper 
nanofluids and the implementation of the thermoelectric 
cooling technology simultaneously.  
NUMERICAL METHOD 
In this study, the COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS 3.2 
finite-element based package is adopted to do the 
numerical analysis of eqns. (1-4) along with proper 
boundary and initial conditions. Geometrical dimensions 
are set according to parameters listed in Table II. Free 
meshes are generated by the built-in function of this 
package. Total numbers of meshes and nodes are shown 
in Table II, respectively. According to the physical 
properties shown in Table III, the proposed nanofluid 
model, eqns. (5-12), is fitted into the heat transfer module 
of this package and transient numerical results are 
obtained by solving this problem by the UMFPACK 
scheme. Starting from specified initial conditions, the 
discretized transient equations are solved by marching in 
time until the solution is converged. Convergence of 
iteration for velocities, pressure and temperature is 
reached if the following criterion is satisfied,

Decay rate of surface temperature and lowest surface 
temperature 
    As shown in Fig. 7, for the smooth cases and the 
ribbed-channel cases with volume percentage of 1% of 
copper nanofluid, the lowest surface temperatures are 
approaching the same value after 300sec of cooling. This 
temperature is almost equal to the initial temperature 
setting at inlet. Due to the copper nano-particle in the 
based fluid and the rapid decaying heat flux transferring 
through the top surface, the channel fluid behaves like a 
heat conductor with a time delay to transport the energy 
from top surface to the flow. As shown in Fig. 8, if normal 
fluid is considered, temperature differences exist between 
the smooth channel cases and the ribbed-channel cases. 
Also, at the same instant of time, the temperature 
distribution along the top surface of the ribbed-channel 
case is always smaller than the smooth channel one. For 
the cases of Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, it is apparent to find that 
nanofluid is helpful to increase the temperature decay 
rate in the application of freezing chucker.
