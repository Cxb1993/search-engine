 system at various structure types. Research on this subject has progressed well in the 
past several decades.  
 
Other researchers1, 3, 5, 11 to 15 have studied the effect of geological and 
foundation conditions on ground vibration level and its propagation. These studies 
have shown that geotechnical-related influence factors are relatively significant on 
the evaluation of the vibration behavior for high-speed trains. However, there is still 
a need to develop a more comprehensive understanding of this subject when 
analyzing the vibration path. 
 
With these important geotechnical influence factors, this study uses a 
comprehensive measurement scheme to evaluate the characteristics of ground 
vibration induced by Taiwan high-speed rail (THSR) on bridge structures. Various 
foundation types, soil types, and frequency dependences are applied to the field 
measurement data to evaluate both near-field ground vibration and far-field vibration 
propagation. 
 
2. MEASUREMENT OF GROUND VIBRATION AND GROUND SHEAR 
WAVE VELOCITY 
  
 2.1 Trainset  
The trainset of the THSR consists of 12 train-cars with 10 cars for passengers 
and 2 cars for motivation. The lengths of the passenger car (PC) and motive car (MC) 
are 25 m and 27 m, respectively; thus, the total length of the trainset is 304 m. The 
sketch of the trainset configuration and related dimensions of THSR is shown in Fig. 
1. 
 
2.2 Measurement of Ground Vibration 
The ISO 804116 requirements are the main reference base for the selection of 
measurement points and installation of the measuring equipment. Adjacent 
environmental conditions are also essential in avoiding any possible interruption 
during measurement. The vibration measuring plan includes near-field and far-field 
measurements. To establish the near-field vibration database in a consistent reference 
plane, the distance of the near-field vibration was set at about 25 m to the track center. 
 
For far-field measurement, 4-5 measurement points in each site, which were in a 
straight line and perpendicular to the train alignment, were used to simultaneously 
measure the ground vibration when trains pass through the specific location. The first

 As previously described, the frequency domain of the 1/3 octave band was used 
to describe the velocity vibration level. The ground vibration level is expressed in 
terms of its root-mean-square (RMS) velocity using the decibel scale, defined as: 
VL (in dB) = 20 log10 (vm/vref)                                     (1) 
where vm = the measured velocity, and vref = the referred velocity = 10-6 in/sec (= 
2.54×10-6 cm/ sec). 
 
The overall vibration level of 1/3 octave bands was used to evaluate the total 
vibration energy1, 5, 15. The overall vibration level can be transferred from the RMS 
velocity of each 1/3 octave band vibration level using the following calculation:  
VLOA = 10 log10∑ 10VL(fk)/10 = 10 log10(100.1 VL(f1) +100.1 VL(f2)+．．+100.1 VL(fn))      (2) 
=
n
k 1
where VLOA = overall vibration level in decibels, fk = each 1/3 octave band’s center 
frequency (1 ..100 Hz for the frequency of f1 .. fn), and VL(fk) = vibration level for 
each center frequency. 
 
A simple equation of Gutowski and Dym18, modified from that of Bornitz20, 
was used for estimating vibration decay. Gutowski and Dym considered both 
geometrical and material damping under line-source into an expression of Rayleigh 
wave (R-wave) attenuation as follows: 
( )12 rr
12 eVV
−α−×=                    (3) 
where V1 and V2 are the vibration amplitudes of the R-wave at distances r1 and r2, 
respectively; r1 and r2 are the distances from the vibration source; and α is the 
vibration attenuation coefficient for the soil material. 
 
Previous studies15, 20, 21 have concluded that the dependence of frequency plays a 
very important role in the analysis of vibration attenuation. Some researchers1, 3, 15 
further suggested that the coefficient of attenuation should be calculated at each 
center frequency or, at least, at the low, middle, and high frequency ranges because 
the ground attenuation varies for different frequencies. Therefore, two kinds of 
ground vibration attenuations were evaluated from the measured results in the 
subsequent analysis.  
 
Attenuation was initially analyzed from the overall vibration regardless of the 
8 
 
 variation (COV), which is the standard deviation divided by the mean. From these 
statistics, it can be noted that the results of each location at different train speeds are 
reasonably consistent. Therefore, the mean α from all train speeds can be used in 
subsequent analyses.  
 
5. EVALUATION OF GROUND VIBRATION PROPAGATION 
5.1 Near-field Vibration 
Train speed factor 
Figure 5 shows the relation between overall vibration level and train speed for 
all foundation types and soil conditions. Although the data points are relatively 
scattered in the high train speed, it can be seen that the overall vibration level 
increases with increasing train speed. The trend is consistent for all foundation and 
soil types. The values of VLOA range from 56 dB for low train speed (120 km/h), 
whereas the VLOA values are between 58 and 71 dB for high train speed (280-300 
km/h). On average, the difference is about 9 dB between the low and high speeds. 
 
From Fig. 5, it can also be seen that the foundation and soil types affect 
near-field vibration level. The deep foundation in alluvium soils (DA) and shallow 
foundation in rocks (SR) generally show the highest vibration levels, whereas the 
shallow and deep foundations in gravelly soils have the lowest vibration levels. 
 
Dominant frequency 
Based on the vibration level in the 1/3 octave bandwidth frequency response for 
each measurement, three larger vibration levels are considered as peak vibrations. 
Statistical results show that 3.15, 6.3, and 10 Hz are the main dominant frequencies 
for deep foundation in soft ground. For shallow and deep foundations in hard ground, 
the main dominant frequencies are 10, 20, and 31.5 Hz. These results indicate that 
the main dominant frequencies are low for softer ground, and the dominant 
frequency becomes higher when soil strength increases. 
 
Structure volume 
 Figure 6 presents the overall vibration level versus structure volume for various 
foundation and soil types. For a consistent comparison base, the adopted train speeds 
are 280-300 km/h, which are the maximum operation train speeds for THSR. The 
structure volume was calculated including column, spread footing (or pile cap for 
deep foundation), and 10 m deep pile (if any). Based on these available data points, 
it can be concluded that the higher the structure volume, the lower the overall 
vibration level. However, the overall vibration level converges to a constant value 
10 
 
 approach of overall vibration is suitable for application in general vibration 
assessments; the attenuation coefficient, classified as low-mid-high frequency range, 
is useful for cases when the estimated vibration level exceeds the criteria and 
vibration mitigation schemes are required. 
 
5.3 Overview of Analysis Results 
 Observing the above analysis results, the deep foundation in alluvium soils has 
the highest near-field vibration level and lowest attenuation coefficient, especially 
for the low frequency range. Therefore, the issue of ground vibration induced by 
high-speed trains for deep foundation in alluvium soils may be the most critical 
situation when evaluating vibration impact. On the other hand, the shallow 
foundation in gravelly soils presents the lowest near-field vibration level and the 
largest attenuation coefficient; therefore, ground vibration impact should be 
minimal. 
 
6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
 A wide variety of field measurements are used to evaluate the ground vibration 
induced by Taiwan high-speed trains on bridge structures. The database includes 
various foundation types, geological conditions, and train speeds for evaluating the 
characteristics of near-field vibration and far-field vibration propagation. Based on 
these analyses, the following conclusions emerged. 
1. The near-field overall vibration level increases with increasing train speed for all 
foundation and soil types. The values of VLOA range from 56 dB for low train 
speed (120 km/h) to 58-71 dB for high train speed (280-300 km/h). On average, 
the difference is about 9 dB between the low and high speeds. 
2. The results show that 3.15, 6.3, and 10 Hz are the main dominant frequencies for 
deep foundation in soft ground. For shallow foundation and deep foundation in 
hard ground, the main dominant frequencies are 10, 20, and 31.5 Hz. 
3. The higher the structure volume, the lower the overall vibration level. The 
overall vibration level converges to a constant value when the structure volume 
is greater than 600 m3. 
4. The α values of shallow foundations are larger than those of deep foundations. 
The average α value for shallow foundation in hard ground is about 2.0 ×10-3 
(1/m), whereas the average α value for deep foundations ranges from soft ground 
with 0.85 ×10-3 (1/m) to hard ground with 1.80 ×10-3 (1/m). 
5. The low frequency range (1-8 Hz) has the smallest α value, while the high 
frequency range (31.5-100 Hz) presents the highest α.

Evaluation of ground vibration induced by high-speed trains on 
embankments 
 
ABSTRACT 
This study uses a comprehensive measurement scheme to evaluate the behavior 
of ground vibration propagation induced by high-speed trains on embankment 
structures. Both near-field and far-field vibrations are examined. A wide variety of 
geological conditions are studied. In the evaluation of the differences in vibration 
attenuation, various frequency dependences of attenuation coefficient - including 
overall vibration, low-mid-high range, and 1/3 octave bands - are applied to the field 
measurement data. In general, the near-field vibration level and overall vibration 
attenuation decrease with increasing ground shear wave velocity. Furthermore, the 
vibration attenuation at low frequency is smaller compared to the attenuation at high 
frequency. Based on these analyses, the interrelationships of vibration level, 
vibration attenuation, ground shear wave velocity, and frequency are established. 
Specific analysis recommendations are proposed for the application of ground 
vibration assessment in engineering and related fields. 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Since the high-speed railway system has many service advantages and lower 
energy consumption compared to other transport systems, high-speed rail travel has 
become very competitive. More and more high-speed rail lines are being constructed 
to connect major cities in Asia, Europe, and the United States. However, the ground 
vibration induced by the train system can reach levels that cause annoyance to humans 
and interruption of sensitive instrumentation. Hence, in recent years, the ground 
vibrations induced by high-speed trains have drawn researchers’ interests. 
Researchers have studied measurement techniques and have evaluated vibration 
characteristics to develop a scheme for vibration mitigation. 
 
To evaluate the possible vibration level, researchers1-3 developed a prediction 
methodology for ground vibration induced by high-speed trains on various structures. 
The main factors affecting vibration levels consist of vibration source, vibration path, 
and vibration receiver. Among these factors, vibration source and vibration receiver 
have been studied by many authors4-9 using numerical analysis, which considers 
soil-structure interaction. The geological condition is also known to have a 
significant effect on the evaluation of the vibration level of high-speed trains1, 3, 10, 11.

 interruption during measurement. The vibration measuring plan includes near-field 
and far-field measurements. To establish the near-field vibration database, some 
possible influence parameters should be identified on a consistent reference plane. 
The distance of near-field vibration is about 25 m to the track center. The heights of 
embankment are between 5-7 m because they are the most commonly used in the 
THSR. The adopted train speeds are 290-300 km/h, which are the maximum operation 
speeds for the THSR. 
 
For far-field measurement, a total of 4-5 measurement points in each site, which 
are in a straight line and perpendicular to the train alignment, are used to 
simultaneously measure the ground vibration when trains pass through the specific 
location. The first measurement point (the nearest point from the high-speed rail 
alignment) is located just beside the toe of the embankment, while the distance of the 
last measurement point (the farthest point from the alignment) which is dependent on 
the field condition is between 100 m and 200 m. The remaining points are located at 
average intervals. Figure 2 presents the photo of Site 3 and a typical schematic layout 
of the measurement points. 
 
Based on the characteristics of ground vibration induced by high-speed trains, a 
range of amplitudes (10~100 dB ref. 1 micro-inch/sec) and frequencies (1~100 Hz) 
were needed for this research assessment. Basic measuring equipment such as 
accelerometers, integrator, and a data acquisition system were used for this study. 
Microphones were sometimes used as auxiliary instruments to record the noise and 
evaluate whether the other vibration sources interfered with the measurement. A set of 
measuring instruments and equipment is shown in Fig. 3. The vibration 
accelerometers include the X (longitudinal), Y (transverse), and Z (vertical) directions. 
Only the vertical component (Z direction) is used in the subsequent discussion 
because it is often a dominant value among the X, Y, and Z directions in a general 
situation10, 19. To evaluate the frequency effect of ground vibration, the frequency 
domain of a 1/3 octave band for the center frequency range of 1 to 100 Hz was 
adopted to describe the velocity vibration level in decibel (dB). 
 
Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show the measured vibration velocity in time domain and 
the 1/3 octave bandwidth frequency response, respectively, in the Z-direction. The 
train consists of 12 cars with a train speed of 300 km/h at 25 m from the track center 
of high-speed rail. In this case, it can be seen that a group of peaks appears distinctly 
in Fig. 4(a) when the train passes the measurement location. From Fig. 4, it can also

frequencies of lf , uf , and cf  are based on the definition of the 1/3 octave band 
in ANSI20.

 where the referred velocity in this study is -60=10σ  in/sec (= 2.54×10-8 m/sec). 
 
The overall vibration level of all 1/3 octave bands is used to evaluate the total 
vibration energy1, 10. The overall vibration level can be transferred from the RMS 
velocity of each 1/3 octave band vibration level by calculating as follows:  
VLoa = 10 log10 10VL(fk)/10 = 10 log10(100.1 VL(f1) +100.1 VL(f2)+．．+100.1 VL(fn))      (5) ∑
=

k 1
in which VLoa = overall vibration level in decibels, fk = each 1/3 octave band’s center 
frequency (1 ..100 Hz for the frequency of f1 .. fn), and VL(fk) = vibration level for 
each center frequency. 
 
A simple equation of Gutowski and Dym21, modified from Bornitz22, is used for 
estimating vibration decay. Gutowski and Dym considered both geometrical and 
material damping under line-source into an expression of Rayleigh wave (R-wave) 
attenuation as follows: 
V2 = V1 exp [-α (r2-r1)]                 (6) 
where V1 and V2 are the vibration amplitudes of R-wave at distances r1 and r2, 
respectively; r1 and r2 are the distances from the vibration source, and α is the 
attenuation coefficient for the soil material. The use of a line-source for analysis is 
based on the suggestion by the U.S. Federal Railroad Administration1. In addition, 
Chang23 conducted a series of analyses to examine the reliability of line-source, 
point-source, as well as the reliability between them from a large number of field 
measurements. The study showed that the line-source gave the better statistics. 
 
It is known that since the wave propagation through layered halfspace is 
 28
 can be seen that a wide variety of geological conditions and ground shear wave 
velocities were included, ranging from soft ground to hard ground. The database was 
considered as sufficient representative for the evaluation of ground vibration 
attenuation. 
 
The geological conditions included silty clay, sandy silt, gravel, and sandstone. 
The SPT-N values (blow count number from the standard penetration test) ranged 
from 8 to >100, and the average ground shear wave velocity (Vs) was between 170 
and 650 m/s. The Vs values were tested from adjacent sites, which presented 
relatively close geological conditions with the conditions in this study. 
 
The analysis results of the overall vibration level for near-field (25 m to the 
track center) and far-field measurements are shown in Table 2. Tables 3 through 5 
present the results of vibration attenuation (α) for the overall vibration, frequency 
range, and each center frequency, respectively. The statistical data are presented to 
describe the quality of these analyses, including the mean value, the standard 
deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (COV), which is the standard deviation 
divided by the mean. From these statistics, it can be noted that the results of each 
location at different train speeds are reasonably consistent. Therefore, the mean α 
from all train speeds can be used in the subsequent analysis. In addition, it can be 
seen obviously that the attenuation coefficient is frequency dependence. 
 
5. EVALUATION OF GROUND VIBRATION PROPAGATION 
5.1 Near-field Vibration 
Figure 6 shows the relationship of overall vibration level (VLoa) and ground 
shear wave velocity (Vs). As can be seen, the near-field vibration level decreases 
with increasing Vs. In other words, the results show that the softer the ground, the 
higher the near-field vibration level. The values of VLoa range from 66 to 72 dB for 
soft ground (alluvial soils), while the VLoa values are between 56 and 60 dB for hard 
ground (gravels and rock). For intermediate hard ground, the overall vibration levels 
are between the above values.  
 
5.2 Vibration Propagation 
Figure 7 shows the relationship between the mean attenuation coefficient α and 
ground shear wave velocity for overall vibration. The variation of mean α values is 
1.2-4.0×10-3 (1/m) according to the order from hard ground to soft ground. 
Regression analyses show that α is given by: 
α = 0.58 + 549/Vs            (7) 
 30
 Figure 9 demonstrates the relationship of α-Vs-f in three dimensions. Although 
the individual attenuation coefficient is somewhat variable, the general trend can be 
found from these results. High frequencies with low ground shear wave velocity 
(soft ground) demonstrate the highest α value; the value clearly decreases with 
increasing ground shear wave velocity or decreasing frequency. Low frequencies 
present the smallest α and the difference is small between sites. Comparing these 
results with the approach using the low-mid-high range, the same trend is observed.  
 
Figures 10(a) and 10(b) present the measured results of near-field and far-field 
vibrations for soft ground (Site 1) and hard ground (Site 4), respectively. The decibel 
level of each frequency is taken from the average of several passes with train speeds 
between 280 and 300 km/h. The distance of the near-field is at 22-28 m from 
alignment, while the far-field is located at around 100 m. Based on Fig. 10, it is clear 
that the difference is large for soft ground at high frequencies; however, the 
differences are relatively small for soft or hard ground at low and middle frequency 
ranges. These findings are consistent with the results of the attenuation coefficient, 
as shown previously. 
 
Comparing Tables 3 through 5 for various frequency conditions, the attenuation 
for overall vibration is somehow too rough to reflect the variety of vibration levels 
in different frequencies. This may result in the unreliability of vibration assessment 
for certain specific frequencies. Although each center frequency is the best selection 
for far-field vibration analysis, it presents high sensitivity to the measurement data in 
some frequencies and results in large variations. Moreover, it requires more 
manpower and time for analysis. Therefore, the low-mid-high range approach can be 
used as an appropriate alternative analytical methodology for general vibration 
assessment. 
6. ANALYSIS RECOMMENDATIONS 
Based on the measurement data analyses, the geological condition and 
frequency dependence of attenuation coefficient should be considered in the 
evaluation of ground vibration induced by high-speed trains on embankment 
structures. Geological condition can be the first consideration for the analysis of 
vibration attenuation and ground shear wave velocity can be used as the reference 
base. 
 
The frequency-dependent attenuation coefficient can reflect the actual field 
situation and help engineers further improve the accuracy of ground vibration 
prediction in a specific geological condition. In general, the low-mid-high frequency
