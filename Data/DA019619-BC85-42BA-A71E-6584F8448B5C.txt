51. Introduction
In general, the fluid in ocean is deemed as a stratified fluid according to the
variation of the salinity and density with respect to the vertical coordinate normal to
the surface. Based on results of many field observations, it is found that the density
changes rapidly within the region of pycnocline. Hence, in many analytical and
numerical studies, the concept of a two-fluid system is adopted to simulate wave
motions in practical applications without great loss of correctness.
Many theoretical models for waves in a two-fluid system have been established
with various restrictions on length scales. Among these, Benjamin (1966) derived the
KdV equation valid for the conditions that both layers are thin in comparison with the
wave length. Later, Benjamin (1967), Davis and Acrivos (1967) and Ono (1975)
constructed the BO equation under the assumptions of a thin upper layer and an
infinitely deep lower layer. A bridge connecting the gap of the limitation of length
scales of the KdV equation and the BO equation is the intermediate long wave
equation (ILW model) derived by Kubota et al. (1978). Choi and Camassa (1996,
1999) carried out a series of investigations to derive model equations for weakly and
fully nonlinear wave propagations. The upper boundary is allowed to be either free or
rigid. The assumptions they made are that the wavelength of interfacial wave is long,
the upper layer is thin and no depth restriction is made on the lower layer. Numerical
simulations and effects of a sloping bottom on the wave evolution were also
investigated.
In order to overcome the restrictions on length scales, Matsuno (1993) attempted to
unify the KdV, BO and ILW models using the assumption of small wave steepness.
Lynett and Liu (2002) assumed a small density difference and then derived a set of
model equations. A high-order, finite difference numerical algorithm was also
developed to perform the comparison with existing analytical solutions and
experimental data. They concluded that, for capturing the real wave phenomenon
more accurately, one needs to consider the effects of stratification and energy
dissipation. A high-order nonlinear model is also expected to make the prediction
more precise. Recently, Craig et al. (2005) presented a Hamiltonian perturbation
theory for the long-wave limit, and provided a uniform treatment of various
long-wave models (KdV, BO and ILW models). Their formulation is shown to be very
effective for perturbation calculations and is a basis for numerical simulations.
For a single-fluid system, in past two decades, the traditional Boussinesq equations
have been greatly improved to extend its applicable range from shallow water to deep
water (for example, see Nwogu (1993), Chen and Liu (1995), Wei et al. (1995),
Madsen and Schäffer (1998) and Gobbi et al. (2000)). Most studies applied the
technique of the Padé approximation to allow a much higher order of accuracy

Effects of currents on super- and sub-harmonic waves in a two-fluid
system
Chi-Min Liu1 and Hwung-Hweng Hwung2
Received 4 January 2007; accepted 26 February 2007; published 27 March 2007.
[1] Effects of currents on wave motions in a two-fluid
system are theoretically studied in this paper. Since super-
and sub-harmonic waves are naturally generated by the
interaction of arbitrary linear waves, it is of theoretical and
practical interest to investigate the influence of pure currents
not only on linear waves, but also on second-order waves.
Solutions are derived using the perturbation technique.
Solutions of internal Stokes waves recovered from present
solutions are firstly discussed. Analyses of the super- and
sub-harmonic interactions are carried out for the deep- and
shallow-water configurations, respectively. Conditions
resulting in the elimination of second-order waves are
determined. Present solutions include and unify most
existing theories for the two- and single-fluid systems, and
are of great importance to the analysis of random internal
waves. Citation: Liu, C.-M., and H.-H. Hwung (2007), Effects

1. Introduction
[2] Interactions between waves and currents in a two-
fluid system are of great importance to geophysical and
engineering research. For pure wave motions, second-order
bound waves are generated from the interaction between
two arbitrary linear waves. There are two components of
second-order waves, the sum-frequency and the difference-
frequency components, which refer to the super- and sub-
harmonic components, respectively. Stokes [1847] derived
the second-order solutions describing the self-interaction
of the first-order waves for a single-fluid system. This self-
interaction is a special case of the superharmonic interac-
tions. The Stokes theory was extended by Hunt [1961] and
Thorpe [1968] to examine the interfacial wave motion
between two fluids of different densities. For random
second-order waves generated by arbitrary linear waves,
Liu [2006] derived solutions of super- and sub-harmonic
waves in a two-fluid system in which the current effects and
surface tension are not included. Most existing theories
either for a single-fluid system or for a two-fluid system
can be recovered from Liu’s solutions.
[3] In the presence of stream effects, most studies have
focused upon the interactions between Stokes waves and
currents. These studies assume that the speeds of upper and
lower currents are uniform but different in each layer. For
example,Miles [1986] derived the solutions of wave-current
interaction and analyzed the associated Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability. Though current effects on Stokes waves have
been well investigated, the theory of coupled effects
between currents and super- and sub-harmonic waves is
not well developed. Hence, the objective of the present
study is to theoretically establish the second-order solutions
of super- and sub-harmonic waves arising from the interac-
tion between arbitrary linear waves and currents. Solutions
for internal Stokes waves are examined. Solutions for the
deep- and shallow-water configurations are investigated and
critical conditions which result in the elimination of second-
order waves are consequently determined.
2. Derivation
[4] A two-fluid system bounded by two rigid plates, as
shown in Figure 1, is used for analysis. The flow in each
layer is assumed to be irrotational and inviscid. The
symbols Fi, Ui, ri, and hi represent the velocity potential
for pure wave motions, the current speed, the density, and
the undisturbed layer thickness for the upper (i = 1) and
lower (i = 2) fluids, respectively. The horizontal coordinate
is denoted by x, while z indicates the vertical coordinate
starting at the undisturbed interface and pointing upward.
The displacement of the interface is represented by h. The
current in each layer is assumed to be uniformly flowing
along the x direction. The governing equations and
boundary conditions for the two-dimensional wave motions
are as follows

3. Internal Stokes Waves
[6] Internal Stokes waves are of great significance and
are examined based on above solutions. The Stokes theory
is apparently a special case of superharmonic interactions
and always attracts a great deal of attention. The interface
displacement for the second-order Stokes theory with
current effects is recovered from the superharmonic com-
ponent of equation (20)

equation (26) is equivalent to Miles’ [1986] result. If one

Equation (28) is identical to that given by Hunt [1961] and
Thorpe [1968]. The well-known phenomenon of Stokes
waves is that the shape of wave crests and troughs will be
slightly modified due to the second-order effects. It is noted
that only the superharmonic component is considered in the
classical Stokes theory. As for the role of subharmonic
components, Chen [2006] analyzed the set-down phenom-
enon for second-order Stokes theory for a single-fluid system
by comparing the Stokes theory and the bichromatic wave
theory. It is observed that the subharmonic wave components
play an important role in changing the mean water level. As
for internal waves, if one assumes frequencies of two first-
order waves approach to each other, the subharmonic
solution is (wn ! wm = w, kn ! km = k)

(1)/2, above limiting
subharmonic solution which is non-oscillatory and influ-
ences only the mean water level should be incorporated
into equation (28) in order to represent Stokes theory
more completely. Since general second-order wave theory
[cf. Liu, 2006] contains the subharmonic effects, one could
achieve the coincidence between the Stokes theory and
general second-order theory by adjusting the Bernoulli
constant appearing in the dynamic boundary condition.
4. Analyses of the Deep- and Shallow-Water
Approximations
[7] In this section, the super- and sub-harmonic interac-
tions are examined for the deep-water and shallow-water
configurations, respectively. It should be noted that the
assumption that km > kn > 0 is made throughout this section.
For the deep-water configuration, wavelengths of all waves
are assumed to be much smaller than thicknesses of both

It is noted, however, that, if one expands the solutions of
above unknowns one by one, the denominator of each
unknown will consist of a summation of six terms and
the numerator will include even more terms. Therefore,
without loss of correctness, the solutions expressed in
equation (39) are more concise than other expressions.
3. Transfer Function and Internal Wave Profile
[8] Similar to studies of second-order surface waves, the
introduction of transfer functions is of great importance to
analyze the relation between the first- and second-order
wave amplitudes. The superharmonic (the superscript plus)
and the subharmonic (the superscript minus) transfer func-
tions for surface (the subscript s) and internal (the subscript
i) waves are respectively defined as
G

;G

As exact solutions of second-order components are obtained
in equation (39), all cases under different circumstances,
which include variations of layer thicknesses, density ratio
and wave length, can be well understood. Accordingly, in
present study we only stress the second-order super-
harmonic internal waves induced by the self interaction
(m = n) of the first-order waves with a fixed wavenumber.
Three types of the first-order internal waves are assumed as
follows

where the superscripts f and s represent the fast and slow
modes respectively, and, two angular frequencies sn
+ and sn

satisfy the linear dispersion relationship equation (26) for a
given wave number kn. Consequently, three types of
interactions including the fast-fast (F-F), the fast-slow
(F-S) and the slow-slow (S-S) interactions are generated.
The associated superharmonic transfer functions of different
types for the case of rr = 0.9, which is very close to the
circumstance in the ocean, are drawn in Figure 2. The
tendencies of transfer functions of the F-F and S-S
interactions are very similar to that of a single-layer case
[see, e.g., Sand and Mansard, 1986]. As for the F-S
interaction, the value of the transfer function increases as
kn(h1 + h2) grows. The corresponding wave profiles at t = 0
are depicted in Figure 3. The given conditions are an = 0.25,
kn = 0.5, h1 = h2 = 5 and rr = 0.9. The effects of second-
order waves of all cases on wave profiles are that the crest is
sharpen and the trough is flattened. In fact, one can also
predict the effect of second-order waves with the help of
Figure 2. The larger value of the transfer function causes the
stronger effect of second-order solutions on wave profiles.
4. Conclusions and Remarks
[9] In a two-fluid system with free surface, second-order
solutions induced by the interactions of first-order solutions
are theoretically derived in this study. The associated
transfer functions are defined to analyze the relation be-
tween the first- and second-order wave amplitudes. Accord-
ing to the existence of the fast and slow modes of wave
motions, there exist three combinations of linear waves.
Effects of each type on the transfer function and the wave
profile are well examined. Since exact solutions have been
shown in equation (39), irregular wave trains under arbi-
trarily given length scales and densities can be theoretically
analyzed using Fourier analysis techniques. Hence, present
results have significant applications in both statistical and
theoretical studies of random internal waves. Besides,
assuming the presence of free surface instead of setting
the upper boundary rigid, the present study has a potentially
contribution to many other topics, for example, the two-
phase flow problems.
[10] In addition, present solutions reduce to most of
previous results, especially the surface waves propagating
over a single fluid. Setting the density of the upper fluid to
be zero (rr = 0), the first-order solutions reduce to the
following forms

ABSTRACT 
The flow of a viscous fluid disturbed by an oscillating plate of arbitrary initial phase is studied in pre-
sent note.  The exact solutions of the velocity and the shear stress are solved using a Laplace transform 
method.  The velocity is derived in terms of complementary error functions and the shear stress on the 
boundary is given in the form of Fresnel integrals.  Since the steady-state solutions are well known, our 
discussions are focused on the transient solutions.  The transient state will disappear faster for the wall 
stress than that for the velocity field.  Comparing the results corresponding to different initial phases, the 
cosine case reaches to the steady state more rapidly than the sine case. 
Keywords : Stokes’ second problem, Transient solution, Wall shear stress. 
1.  INTRODUCTION 
The problem describing the fluid motivated by an os-
cillatory plate is usually referred to as Stokes’ second 
problem [1], which is well-known and important in 
fundamental fluid mechanics.  Most previous studies 
gave a steady-state solution composed of the product of 
a decaying exponential function and a cosine function, 
which is in phase with the plate as ([1,2]) 
 0 exp cos2 2
u U y t y
⎛ ⎞ ⎛ ⎞ω ω= − ω −⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟ν ν⎝ ⎠ ⎝ ⎠
 
Though the above solution satisfies the governing equa-
tion and all boundary conditions, however, it is not a 
complete solution after all.  The so-called complete 
solution must include two parts, the steady-state solu-
tion and the transient solution.  The transient solution 
is very important in analyzing the fluid motion at small 
times even though it will disappear rapidly as time goes 
by.  Panton [3] presented a closed-form solution for the 
complete solution with transient part containing expo-
nential functions and error functions.  Erdogan [4] also 
applied the Laplace transform to treat this problem and 
obtained the results very similar to Panton’s solution.  
Their conclusions indicate that the transient period for 
the cosine oscillation of the plate is one–half cycle and 
is a full cycle for the sine oscillatory case.  Even if 
their results are exact, the discussion of the shear stress 
and the velocity distribution generated by a harmonic 
oscillating plate of arbitrary initial phase is still lack.  
Although the velocity distribution reaches the 
steady-state status in a short time, it is crucial and inter-
esting to examine the transient period.  The initial 
phase not only decides the phase of the steady-state ve-
locity but also influences the transient period.  The 
initial phase also plays an important role in the shear 
stress that is rarely discussed in previous studies.  The 
magnitude of the shear stress on the plate implies how 
the external force should be acted on the boundary to 
maintain the fluid motion.  Therefore, to understand 
the frictional force is useful and helpful to start and 
maintain Stokes’ second problem exact in practical ap-
plications.  It should be noticed that there exists a 
suddenly driving force on the fluid at the starting point

Certainly, Eq. (10) can be also derived from Eq. (9) as T 
approaches infinity by using the property of the com-
plementary error function with the complex argument.  
Consequently, the transient solution ut can be obtained 
by subtracting Eq. (10) from Eq. (9).  Figures (1a) and 
(1b) display the transient velocity distributions for the 
cosine case (θ = 0) and the sine case (θ = −π / 2), re-
spectively.  It shows that the transient velocity in the 
cosine case decays more rapidly than that in the sine 
case.  The ratio of ut to U0 is less than 0.01 for cosine 
case at T = 5and it is greater than 0.04 for the sine case.  
Figure 2 gives more detailed descriptions of the tran-
sient velocity at small times.  It is noted that the scale 
of x  axis in Figs. (2a) and (2b) is not the same.  At T 
= 0.5, it is still hard to recognize which curve is fastest 
decaying.  As for the case T = 5, it shows that as the 
initial phase is closer to zero, the shorter the transient 
period will be.  One may say that the interval to reach 
the steady state for cosine case is the shortest and it 
takes longer times for the sine case. 
3.  THE SHEAR STRESS ON THE BOUNDARY 
The shear stress τ is doubtless another important 
characteristic of the motion of fluid.  It can be obtained 
by differentiating Eq. (8) with respect to y and is shown

the sine case, respectively.  Though there exists a dis-
continuity at T = 0 for the cosine case, the solution still 
reaches to the steady state faster that of the sine case.  
Figure 4 shows the variations of transient shear stress 
with some specific initial phases.  Owing to the rapid 
decay of the first term in Eq. (13), all curves almost 
reach to the steady states rapidly.  After the one cycle 
passes, the amplitudes of ˆwtτ  decrease gradually in all 
cases.  The transient time of the wall shear stress is 
longer than that of the velocity field.  The ratio of the 
amplitude of the transient shear stress to that of the 
complete solution will be less than 0.05 as T ≥ 100.  
The influence of different initial phases lies mainly in 
the slight inconsistency of both the amplitude and the 
phase between the complete solution and the 
steady-state solution.  Finally, the transient shear stress 
at the plate will approach zero.

4.  CONCLUSIONS 
In summary the complete solution composed of the 
steady-state and the transient solutions are derived for 
depicting the viscous flow motivated by an oscillatory 
plate of arbitrary initial phase.  The velocity profile is 
expressed in terms of complementary error functions.  
As the initial phase is closer to zero, the shorter the 
transient period exists.  There are two terms in expres-
sion of the stress, one of which is proportional to T −0.5 
and the other consists of sine and cosine Fresnel inte-
grals.  The wall shear stress of the cosine case, like its 
velocity counterpart, approaches the steady state more 
rapidly than that of the sine case.  The transient state 
will disappear faster for the wall stress than that for the 
velocity field.

THE O(µ6) BOUSSINESQ EQUATIONS WITH THE RECURSION
FORM FOR WAVES PROPAGATING FROM DEEP WATER TO
SHALLOW WATER
Chi-Min Liu*, Chin-Hwa Kong, and Chi-Kuo Lee
ABSTRACT
A study of the Boussinesq equations for waves propagating from deep water to
shallow water is presented.  In this paper, we derive the O(µ6) Boussinesq equations
with the recursion forms not only for main variables but also coefficients.  This greatly
reduces the efforts needed to derive the higher-order Boussinesq equations.  Param-
eters concerning the linear and nonlinear wave properties are also derived to analyze
the accuracy of present models.  The linear properties include the phase velocity, the
group velocity and the particle velocities.  The forcing terms of the continuity equa-
tion and the equation of motion are developed to analyze the nonlinear properties.  By
choosing a suitable water-depth parameter m, the optimal wave models are conse-
quently determined.  Our model provides an easier and more flexible method to ana-
lyze the wave mechanics than previous studies based on the Padé approximation.
Key Words: the Boussinesq equations, the recursion form, the optimal model.

I. INTRODUCTION
The classical Boussinesq equations, first derived
by Boussinesq (1871), are frequently applied to ana-
lyze wave mechanics in shallow water.  The promi-
nent equations are in terms of the depth-averaged
velocity and the free surface elevation for a wave propa-
gating over a flat bottom.  There are two crucial pa-
rameters associated with Boussinesq equations, the
nonlinearity represented by the ratio of wave ampli-
tude to water depth, ε = a0h 0– 1 and the frequency dis-
persion denoted by the product of wave number and
water depth, µ = k0h0.  For most of the applications
of Boussinesq equations, the dispersion parameter is
equal to the square of the nonlinearity parameter.
Another restriction is that both parameters must be
smaller than unity due to the shallow water condition.
After one century passed, Peregrine (1967) im-
proved the classical Boussinesq equations for wave
propagating over an uneven seabed.  This was a key
opening for new researches on old equations.  For
most researchers, numbers of efforts they made are
for the sake of extending the applicable depth range
of Boussinesq equations wider.  Consequently, vari-
ous kinds of optimal wave equations were evaluated
in the following two decades.  Witting (1984) applied
conservative equations to analyze wave mechanics in
a constant-depth channel.  The wave equations were
expressed in terms of the depth-averaged velocity and
the mean free surface velocity respectively.  He ex-
panded the dispersion relation into a Taylor series
form.  Then the corresponding coefficients were de-
termined to yield a Padé approximation to the Taylor
expansion of the dispersion relation given by the lin-
ear Stokes wave theory.  By applying the (2, 2) Padé
approximation, Witting obtained good results for both
deep and shallow water waves.
In 1991, Madsen et al. formulated the conventional
Boussinesq equations for a flat bottom in terms of vol-
ume flux components instead of the depth-averaged

Observing the expressions of Eqs. (7) and (8),
the recursion forms appear not only in the terms Φ i
but in the terms Ψi.  The recursion forms make the
derivation of the high-order equations more efficient.
Consequently, the corresponding variables can be

IV.  NONLINEAR ANALYSIS
Two series of parameters will be defined and in-
troduced to analyze the nonlinear properties in this
section.  These two nonlinear parameters are obtained
from the equation of continuity and the equation of mo-
tion respectively.  To analyze the Boussinesq equations,
we first introduce the perturbation expansion of the free
surface elevation and the velocity potential as
Φm = Φ0 + εΦ1 + ε
2Φ2 + (26)
η = η0 + εη1 + ε2η2 + ... (27)
By applying Eqs. (26) and (27) into Eq. (5), we
order the equation by powers of ε.  At each order
O(εn), it yields (setting h = 1)
∂ηn
∂t + L1Φn = –∇ ⋅ Fn (28)
where the operator L1 is
L1 = (G1∇ 2 + µ2G2∇ 2∇ 2 + µ4G3∇ 2∇ 2∇ 2
+ µ6G4∇ 2∇ 2∇ 2∇ 2) (29)
Consequently, we obtain
F0 = 0 (30a)

In order to obtain the optimal Boussinesq
equations, both the linear and the nonlinear param-
eters will be considered in next section to make the
closest approach to those of the Stokes theory by
choosing a suitable water-depth parameter m.
V.  THE OPTIMAL BOUSSINESQ
EQUATIONS
The different kinds of Boussinesq-type equations
can be formulated by choosing the water-depth parameter
m.  In shallow water with the condition 0 < µ < 1, all
kinds of equations provide an excellent prediction of
all properties for wave propagation.  However, as waves
travel in medium or deep water, the choice of m will
strongly dominate both the behaviors of nonlinear and
linear characteristics of waves.  Namely, though each
linear or nonlinear characteristic has its own optimal
value of m, we still need to determine the optimal m to
balance all behaviors.  Many studies based on the Padé
approximation face the dilemma that the most excel-
lent behavior of dispersion relation always leads to
poor predictions of other properties, for example, the
particle velocities.  In this section, we will provide a
new way to balance and overcome such a problem.  In
general cases, all nonlinear and linear properties should
be considered in an equivalent status.  Hence the value
of m will be generated by taking the arithmetic mean
of the optimal m of all properties.  However, it should
be remarked that the other assessment, e.g. the weighted
mean, can be also used for studies which focus on some
specific wave characteristics.  Fig. 1 shows the rela-
tion between the optimal value of m and µ.  The opti-
mal value of m will approach a certain value as µ gets
large enough.  To examine and compare the optimal
models, we choose the range of µ from 0 to 20.  The
corresponding optimal values of m are –0.346,
–0.581 –0.611 for the O(µ2), O(µ4) and O(µ6) models
respectively.  From now on, these three values will be
adopted to examine all available properties of waves.
Observing the phase velocities shown in Fig. 2, the
O(µ2) model represents a poor behavior that the curve

C. M. Liu et al.: The O(µ6) Boussinesq Equations for Waves Propagation 761
–0.8 respectively.  The O(µ6) model gives the best ap-
proximation to the exact solution.  It also shows that
the curves diverge faster in the lower elevation water
than in the upper one.  Comparing Fig. 3 with Fig. 2,
the accuracy of the phase velocity is more precise than
that of the particle velocities as µ grows.  This result,
which was also mentioned by Gobbi et al. (2000), shows
that the natural characteristics of phase velocities and
particle velocities are intrinsically different.  The pa-
rameter of particle motions owns higher powers of co-
efficients so that it is harder to approach the exact
solution.
As for the nonlinear properties, two parameters
nonlinear parameters, Ei and Fi, which concern the equa-
tion of motion and the equation of continuity are slightly
different from the transfer coefficients which appeared
in Gobbi et al. (2000) and Madsen et al. (2002).  The
transfer coefficients are obtained by introducing the
Stokes-like expansion of wave amplitude and the concept
of bound waves.  Here we directly analyze the forcing
terms of two nonlinear equations, Eq. (28) and Eq. (31),
without making any assumption of wave types.  Figs.
5 and 6 display the phenomenon of the forcing terms
(E1, E2, F1, F2).  The O(µ6) model still shows a better
behavior than the other models.
Finally, we should emphasize again that the op-
timal values of m used in this section are obtained by
taking the arithmetic mean of the optimal m of all
linear and nonlinear properties.  In other words, if
the respective optimal value of m of each wave prop-
erty is adopted, the behavior will be much better than
that using the present figures.  Additionally, in some
figures we find that the accuracy of the O(µ4) model
will surpass the O(µ6) model when µ is large enough.
It is a natural phenomenon because of the highly di-
vergent behavior of the higher-order model.  In what
range of µ the accuracy of the lower-order model will
exceed that of the high-order model is another inter-
esting topic in the future.  The details will be left to
our next study.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
In the present study, the O(µ6) Boussinesq equa-
tions are derived in terms of the velocity potential at
an arbitrary elevation.  A recursion form is adopted

III. TRANSFER FUNCTIONS
In this section, a quantity indicating the the
second-order amplitude divided by two interacting
first-order waves is the transfer function (abbreviated as TF
hereafter) and is defined as

where the superscripts plus and mimus represent the super-
and subharmonic effects, respectively. The subscripts S
and I stand for surface and internal waves. Sicne there
are two modes of motion possibly excited, in this study
only the slow (internal) mode of motion resulting a
comparatively large internal waves than surface waves is
investigated. Therefore the obsservation for SG is
consequently ignored herein. TFs under the same condition
21 hh  with various wavenumber ratios are plotted in Fig.
1. A larger value of the wavenumber ratio results in
stronger second-order effects on the wave profile. It also
implies that the profile of internal Stokes wave ( nm kk  )
has a sharper crest and a flatter trough due to the
second-order effects. Besides, the tendency of  ImnG , is
quite similar to that for the single-fluid case (Fig.2, [6]).
Results for the condition nm kk  with various thickness
ratios are drawn in Fig. 2. The thickness ratios not only
dominate the magnitudes of TFs but influence their signs.
It is observed that for the long-wave regime TFs usually
have opposite signs for the thicker-upper-layer case and the
thicker-lower-layer case.
Results for the subharmonic case are plotted in Figs. 3
and 4. For the condition 21 hh  , Fig.3 shows that values
of TFs for internal waves remain negative over the whole
range of 2hkm . The behaviors are analogous to those of the
single-fluid case (Fig.2, [16]). Similar to results for the
superharmonic case, the thickness ratios strongly
dominates the signs and the magnitudes of the TFs, as
shown in Fig. 4.
