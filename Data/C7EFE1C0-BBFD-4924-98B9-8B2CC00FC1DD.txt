Abstract 
The purpose of this three-year project intends to establish a molecular imaging-based 
translational platform to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of brain drug delivery through 
tight junction with the technique of focused ultrasound induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening, 
which in on-going developed from our group. In the second year, we have accomplished as follows: 
(1) The part of subproject 1 provides an integrated nanomedicine platform to enhance and 
monitor delivery of multifunctional nanoparticles to the brain by using MRI. The first contribution 
is on the successful establishment of focused ultrasound induced BBB opening to deliver magnetic 
nanoparticles in using 3T MRI validation. The enhancement of local MNP delivery into brain via 
combined FUS and MT was evaluated. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images confirmed that FUS 
disrupted the BBB. R2 maps showed that FUS treatment alone increased local deposition of MNP 
by 21.5% relative to the contralateral hemisphere. We confirmed that combined FUS and MT can 
dramatically enhance MNP accumulation increased. The second contribution of this year is on the 
confirmation of enhancement of therapeutic MNP delivery to brain tumors by using focused 
ultrasound and a MRI-guided drug delivery platform is proposed. We have confirmed that about 
15-fold higher than the therapeutic range (819 ± 482 ng/g tumor) reported for in vivo doxorubicin, 
which has a clinical response rate of 39% in patients with breast carcinoma. Furthermore, TEM 
showed that FUS apparently induced interendothelial clefts with no obvious tight-junctional 
complexes in tumors, and that epirubicin–MNPs were taken up by tumor cells and macrophages. 
(2) Subplot 2 investigated the safety issue of whether the induction of submicron microbubbles 
(MBs) to oscillate at their resonant frequency would suppress inertial cavitation during blood-brain 
barrier disruption (BBBD) and thereby eliminate intracerebral hemorrhaging (ICH). FUS was 
delivered to the rat left brain hemisphere with pressures from 0.5 to 2.5 MPa (PRF: 10 Hz, cycle 
number: 10,000, exposure time: 60 s) to induce BBBD. Submicron MBs made in-house and 
SonoVueTM were used in the BBBD process. BBBD was assessed by quantifying the amount of 
Evans blue (EB) leakage into the brain. Magnetic resonance susceptibility–weighted images were 
acquired to confirm the occurrence of ICH. Wideband and subharmonic emissions from MBs were 
both measured to quantify the dosages of inertial and stable cavitation, respectively. Excitation of 
MBs with matched resonant frequency FUS (high-frequency 10 MHz in our case) can greatly limit 
the occurrence of inertial cavitation, enhance the appearance of stable cavitation and thereby 
eliminate ICH. Subharmonic-frequency signals closely correlate with the occurrence of BBBD and 
EB leakage, whereas wideband acoustic emission correlates with the occurrence of ICH. The 
second part is to develope drug-loaded MBs (BCNU-MBs) with a high loading capacity (efficiency 
of 68.01 ± 4.35 %) of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1- nitrosourea (BCNU) drug. Note that the 
BCNU-MBs with FUS contained specific acoustic properties for delivering drug and locally 
disrupting BBB simultaneously.The BCNU-MB method performed 5-fold less deposition of BCNU 
in the liver compared to that in traditional chemotherapy, and the MRI images also revealed the 
significant changes in tumor growth between the two methods. Delivery of drug-loaded MBs and 
disruption of BBB by FUS in a xenograft rat glioma model can be achieved at the same time.  
(3) Subplot 3 aims to establish the photoacoustic imaging and gold nanorods for the detection of 
BBB disruption. In the 2nd year, we develop AuNR contrast enhanced US and dual-modal – PA and 
US – imaging techniques for real-time monitoring FUS-induced BBB opening. Compared with 
MRI, the proposed techniques are capable of real-time monitoring of BBB disruption by FUS. The 
developed tools provide unique opportunity to identify and observe the same phenomena resulting 
from the BBB disruption through the two different imaging modalities (PA+US). It is found that US 
imaging is more sensitive than PA imaging in terms of detecting BBB opening foci via extravasated 
AuNR contrast while PA imaging permits quantification of drug delivery (i.e., local concentration 
of  extravasated  AuNRs).  In  addition,  this  is  the  first  time  that  AuNRs  are  demonstrated  to  be  
capable of being as a US contrast agent in such a study. The contrast enhancement mechanism from 
AuNRs suggests that metallic nanoparticles smaller than 6 nm, which permit rapid and efficient 
renal clearance, can be used as an US extra-vascular contrast agent in such a study. It provides a

1.1. MRI contrast enhancement and MNP quantification in vivo. The enhancement of local 
MNP  delivery  into  brain  via  combined  FUS  and  MT  was  evaluated.  Contrast-enhanced  
T1-weighted images confirmed that FUS disrupted the BBB. R2 maps (showing changes caused by 
different amounts of MNP) and T2* imaging (indicating susceptibility-artifact-induced signal loss 
caused by MNP accumulation) showed that FUS treatment alone increased local deposition of 
MNP-3 by 21.5% relative to the contralateral hemisphere (Fig. 1.1). Subsequently applying MT 
increased MNP accumulation, with a 6-hour exposure causing the greatest increase in MNP 
concentration (244.6% relative to the contralateral hemisphere) but also a wider distribution (as 
seen in T2* imaging) relative to brains treated with FUS alone (Fig. 1.1). The combination of FUS 
and 6 h of MT deposited 21,738 ± 3,477 ng of epirubicin/g of brain tissue, whereas treatment with 
FUS alone accumulated only 1,336 ± 1,182 ng epirubicin/g of tissue. Furthermore, local MNP 
capture was dependent on field strength: A 0.55-Tesla (T) magnet attracted four times more MNPs 
than a 0.18-T magnet, as assessed by R2 mapping.

 The amount of MNPs accumulated in brain parenchyma was also measured by 
inductively-coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP–OES) and the epirubicin 
concentration  was  measured  by  HPLC.  Neither  FUS alone  nor  MT alone  caused  significant  MNP 
accumulation in the experimental brain site. Furthermore, accumulation was no more significant on 
the experimental side relative to the contralateral side with either of these treatments. However, 
when FUS and MT were combined, MNP accumulation increased dramatically, with MNP-3 
showing the highest levels of accumulation. Furthermore, the accumulation was markedly more 
pronounced on the side subjected to magnetic targeting. Interestingly, when MNP-2 was used, the 
ratio of MNP accumulation between the experimental and contralateral hemispheres reached a 
maximum at 6 h but dropped quickly at 12 h of MT, whereas the ratio was maintained when MNP-3

(C) Timeline of the in vivo experiment. 
 
The permeability of the BBB was assessed based on the extravasation of EB dye. EB (100 
mg/kg) was injected 5 min prior to FUS sonication. Two different MRI protocols were utilized to 
verify the occurrence of ICH in vivo by a 3-T MRI system. The first  protocol was a T2-weighted 
sequence, which was used to confirm the absence of anatomical changes after sonication. The 
second protocol was a susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) sequence. The tissue damage induced 
by this method was assessed by individually applying hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and terminal 
deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining to confirm the 
presence of erythrocyte extravasation and apoptotic neurons.  
Group 1 successfully induced BBBD with acoustic pressures up to 1.0 MPa. No ICH was 
observed in the gross histological sections. The stable cavitation activity profoundly increased when 
the acoustic pressure was increased to 1.0 MPa, whereas the inertial cavitation activity remained 
suppressed. By comparison, the results for Group 2 demonstrate that when using a mismatched FUS, 
stable cavitation activity cannot be excited, and therefore no BBBD occurs. By contrast, BBBD 
occurred in Group 3 starting from 0.5 MPa. Because the inertial cavitation increased along with the 
stable cavitation when the pressure was increased in Group 3, profound ICH accompanied the 
BBBD. Another noteworthy result is that an increase in pressure from 1 to 1.5 MPa induced a 
dramatic increase in inertial cavitation (from 50% to 110%), causing ICH to become the dominant 
effect. The change in EB extravasation due to the activity of the in-house MBs was highly 
correlated with the subharmonic-frequency signal increase but not with ICD, which indicates that 
inertial cavitation is only weakly correlated with BBBD. Figure 2 provides strong evidence that the 
occurrence of stable cavitation was responsible for BBBD, whereas inertial cavitation was 
responsible for ICH.

FUS energy is well concentrated, and CNS diseases may cover regions larger than the focus 
volume, which makes it necessary to guarantee the safety and efficacy of multiple or repetitive FUS 
sonications. We examined the effects of repetitive FUS sonication at the same location and 
quantified the compound release in an animal model. One possible application of the proposed 
strategy is the safe delivery of drugs to the brain, with the drug being encapsulated by the in-house 
MBs. The delivered compound was bis-chloronitrosourea (BCNU), which is a clinically approved 
chemotherapeutic alkylation agent for brain tumors but whose efficacy is limited due to the inability 
to  deliver  a  sufficient  drug  dose  to  tumors.  The  results  in  Fig.  5(A)  demonstrate  that  BCNU  
encapsulated in MBs was not released into brain tissues, whereas its release could be controlled by 
10-MHz FUS sonications. A higher pressure and a larger number of treatment sites can both be 
used to enhance the delivery of BCNU to brain tissue. We found that the efficacy of BCNU release 
could be improved up to 40 times (relative to control animals) without ICH (Fig. 5(B)). Even 
increasing the sonication time up to 4 min at a single treatment site did not induce brain damage 
(Fig. 5(C)). Thus, this technique can be used to enhance local drug concentrations by prolonging the 
irradiation time. This study provides important information toward the goal of successfully 
translating FUS brain drug delivery into clinical usage.

similar growth tendency as BCNU group, which grew restrictedly from 19.88 ± 4.31 mm3 on day 
10 to 46.68 ± 12.92 mm3 on day 17 (2.5-fold progression), but after that expanded to 108.88 ± 
22.52 mm3 on day 24, and finally to 136.83 ± 30.01 mm3 on day 31. The results suggested that the 
cavitation effect between pure lipid MBs and FUS may have some impact on tumors and restrict 
tumor growth temporarily. Eventually, the results in the BCNU-MB + FUS group showed that not 
only the tumor progression was controlled, but also the tumor volume was shrunk. Tumors did not 
grow but became smaller from 27.80 ± 7.80 mm3 on day 10 to 13.40 ± 4.12 mm3 on day 17, which 
represented a 0.5-fold inhabitation. This suppression effect continued, and the tumor volume 
decreased to 17.95 ± 10.70 mm3 on day 24 and 11.0 ± 1.0 mm3 on day 31 (p<.01 relative to the 
control group).

and received no treatment (blank control), treatment with FUS and MBs (w/o BCNU) on day 4 and 
5 (MB+FUS), or treatment with BCNU-MBs following FUS irradiation on day 4 and 5 (BCNU-MB 
+ FUS). The yellow dot areas point out the locations of tumors.

TEM image of the rat brain inside the sonication volume, identifying that the cerebral endothelial 
cells were closely accompanied with numbers of AuNRs which verified our hypothesis. (c) 
Magnified TEM image relate to the ROI in (b), indicating that individual AuNRs aggregated to 
micro-scale clusters and this would increase the US back-scattering cross-section which also 
contributed to the contrast enhancement. 
 
 Our experimental results demonstrate that US imaging of AuNRs reveal the locations and 
variations of the BBB opening foci (Fig. 3.2 and Fig. 3.3). The contrast enhancement mechanism 
from AuNRs suggests that our imaging technique may potentially remain its acoustic sensitivity 
while metallic nanoparticles smaller than 6 nm, which permit rapid and efficient renal clearance, are 
used as an US extra-vascular contrast agent in such a study. It may provide a unique opportunity to 
solve the accumulation and toxicity problems of metallic nanoparticles in the body, and also make 
the real-time image tracking of FUS BBB-opening becomes possible. The accumulated AuNRs in 
the BBB-opened regions can also serve as the useful “seeds” that deposited locally. These gold 
nanoparticle depositions can greatly enhance the photothermal or irradiation energy absorption to 
rapidly heat up the local diseased tissues and perform local tissue ablation, such as the application 
of malignant brain tumour ablation. In addition, such ultra-small nanoparticles also intrinsically 
benefit  to  penetrate  blood-tumor  barrier  (BTB)  which  has  pore  size  of  about  12  nm  in  malignant  
solid tumor microvasculature. After penetrating BTB, diverse strategies such as tumor positioning, 
monitoring, therapy and imaging-guided surgery, can be carried out based on the enhanced 
permeability and retention (EPR) effect of these nanoparticles.

detection of brain lesion or FUS induced BBB-opening may provide other potentials. First, since 
gold nanoparticles have already been shown their excellent image contrast enhancing capability on 
other imaging tools such as computed tomography (CT), optical imaging, or photoacoustic imaging, 
it provides chance that gold nanoparticles serve as contrast agent in dual- or multiple-imaging 
modality.  Here,  by  combining  the  results  in  section  3.1  and  the  1st year, we propose an AuNR 
contrast-enhanced dual modal – photoacoustic (PA) and ultrasound (US) – imaging technique for 
monitoring FUS-induced BBB opening in a rat model. This provides opportunity to identify and 
observe the same phenomena through different imaging modalities and more importantly, the 
merged information can provide complimentary information to MRI (section 1) and provides 
chances to explore hemodynamic changes and safety issues caused by the FUS sonication, for 
example, the transient ischemia. The mechanism of dual contrast enhancement is illustrated in Fig. 
3.4. To experimentally verify our idea, we also develop an integrated photoacoustic microscopy 
(PAM),  ultrasound  microscopy  (USM)  and  FUS  experimental  platform,  which  is  capable  of  
photoacoustic and ultrasonic guiding the procedure of FUS-induced BBB disruption on a rat model. 
The imaging probes (25 MHz or 50 MHz) and the FUS transducers are confocal along the z-axis. 
The system block diagram is shown in Fig. 3.5.

absorption coefficient Pa. Thus, AuNRs contributes a negligible Pa of ~ 0.66 (0.32 u 2.303 u 0.9) 
cm-1 when compared with the Pa of blood is ~ 4 cm-1 at 800 nm. Despite the low concentration of 
AuNRs in the blood stream, the leakage and accumulation of AuNRs at the BBB opening foci 
increase the local concentration of AuNRs which means more optical absorbers in the acoustic 
sample volume. When considering the ideal situation that the intensity of photoacoustic signal is 
proportional to Pa, the Pa of AuNRs can be approximated to ~ 4 cm-1 by comparing the signal 
intensity of AuNRs to that of blood. There is a ~ 7.8-dB (4/0.66) local increase in the Pa and also in 
the concentration of AuNRs at BBB opening foci. 
 
 
Fig. 3.6. PA, US, and PA+US co-registered images of rat brains before and after microbubble+FUS 
sonication. (a) and (b): US images; (c) and (d): PA images; (e) and (f): PA+US co-registered images 
where PA intensity is color-coded. The while dashed line indicates the BBB opening foci. By 
comparing  (b)  and  (d),  it  is  found that  US images  are  more  sensitive  than  PA images  in  terms  of  
detecting BBB opening foci via extravasated AuNR contrast. However, PA images offer a chance to 
quantify the local concentration of extravasated and accumulated AuNRs by comparing the PA 
signals from AuNRs and blood because the optical absorption coefficient of the blood is known at 
the imaging optical wavelength at 800 nm.

4.2. High-frequency ultrasonic imaging and microbubble fabrication (2nd year):  
In the second year, the part of subproject provides: 1. inertial cavitation suppression with focused 
ultrasound in blood-brain barrier disruption, and 2. delivery of drug-loaded microbubbles and 
disruption of blood-brain barrier by focused ultrasound in a xenograft rat glioma model. The first 
part has demonstrated that the efficacy of FUS-induced BBBD is influenced by the resonance 
frequency of the MBs. The acoustic-emission data indicate that the BBB could be disrupted without 
inertial cavitation but that stable cavitation was required for BBBD. This study provides important 
information toward the goal of successfully translating FUS brain drug delivery into clinical usage. 
The second part is to show that delivery of drug-loaded microbubbles and disruption of blood 
brain-barrier by focused ultrasound in a xenograft rat glioma model can be achieved at the same 
time. Future works include modifying specific ligands and SPIO particles on BCNU-MBs surface 
for targeting therapy and as multimodality contrast agents, respectively. Self-made drug-loaded 
MBs were introduced to delivery the drug of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) and 
interact with FUS to locally disrupt BBB simultaneously. Thus, local drug-loading release could be 
increased meanwhile the systemic side effects reducing.

(3) Study the characteristics of time intensity curves (TIC) of FUS-sonicated brains 
In our pilot trials, it is found that the characteristics of TIC provided by the developed US/PA 
imaging tools are different under different FUS-sonication output – hemorrhage, micro-hemorrhage, 
and no hemorrhage. By leveraging the 2nd year results of the 2nd subproject – conditioning of safe 
BBB opening, we have chances to further study the relationship between TIC and FUS sonication 
output and even the associated safety issues regarding the FUS BBB opening technique. 
 
(4) Study the feasibility of passive sub-harmonic imaging technique to localize BBB opening foci 
By co-working with the 2nd subproject, and leveraging the conditioning of safe BBB opening, and 
based on an ultrasound array imaging platform, we will try to develop a passive sub-harmonic 
imaging technique to localize BBB opening foci which potentially requires no contrast agent.

i.e., the focal point. This technique is based on a linear, 
discrete model of the AR-PAM system developed using matrix 
formalism. Using this model, a spatiotemporal optimal filter in 
minimum mean square error sense is designed to deconvolve 
the spatial impulse responses associated with the focused 
transducer at every imaging point; thus retrospective focusing 
can be achieved. The performance of the proposed ISAFT is 
verified using simulation data. 
II. IMPROVED SYNTHETIC APERTURE FOCUSING 
TECHNIQUE 
A. Spatial impulse response 
The detected signal by a finite-size transducer, from a 
Dirac impulse photoacoustic source and without considering 
the electrical impulse response of the transducer, takes the 
form of a finite-length pulse, depending on the position of the 
source and the geometry of the transducer. This finite-length 
pulse is called the spatial impulse response (SIR) given a 
detection aperture, and can be expressed as[13]

where r and rT are the distance vectors from the coordinate 
origin to the source and transducer surface, respectively, and 
ST represents the transducer surface.  
B. Two dimensionalimaging model of a AR-PAM system  
With the SIR representation described in Eq. (1), the output 
signal from a photoacoustic source, detected at a given 
scanning position Tl of a AR-PAM system can be express as, 
)()(),r()()( SIR rotpththty el ⋅⊗⊗= ,                    (2) 
where he(t) is the electrical impulse response of the transducer, 
p(t) is the photoacoustic waveform, and o(r) is the optical 
absorption determining the amplitude of p(t). According to Eq. 
(1) and Eq. (2), a discrete linear imaging model of a AR-PAM 
for a scanning signle element transducer with a fixed focus is 
developed.  
Figure 1 shows the illustration of sampling in AR-PAM 
data acquisition and raw data set, for matrix formalism of a 
two dimensional imaging model of a AR-PAM system. The 
transducer is linearly scanned and the measurements are taken 
from L positions. The ROI, O, is divided into M x N image 
elements, and each element o(xn, ym) is a scalar representing 
the optical absorption of the absorber at the position of (xn, ym). 
The vector yl  denotes the received A-line at scanning position 
Τl, having K samples. The full data set Y for one complete 
linear scan consists of L discrete time A-lines. 
Using surperposition and Eq. (2), yl can be expressed as a 
sum of photoacoustic waves from all absorbers in the ROI O:

where hSIR(Τl, xn, ym) is the SIR vector from the transducer 
position Τl to o(xn, ym), he and p are vectors of the electrical 
impulse response of the transducer and the photoacoustic 
waveform. After stacking the Y and O into column vectors: y 
and o, the model of the AR-PAM system can be expressed in 
the following matrix notiona [11][12]: 
y = So + e,                (4) 
where e is a vector denoting additive noise, and S denotes 
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
It is demonstrated by simulation that the proposed method 
effectively improves the degraded lateral resolution in the out-
of-focused region for AR-PAM. The improvement in spatial 
resolution and sidelobe suppression of ISAFT is superior to 
that of VD-SAFT because the full geometry of the VD, instead 
of the simplified virtual-point-detector approximation, is taken 
into consideration. Future work will focus on the  phantom 
and in vivo experimental verifications and the study of the 
effect of signal-to-noise ratio on the ISAFT.

where 0C  is the initial speed of sound, K is the lumped constant 
that describes the relationship between temperature and echo time 
shift change and T(z) is the temperature of the medium at axial

to estimate the echo-time shift for the estimation of temperature

B. Nakagami imaging 
Nakagami distribution previously was used to describe the 
envelope statistics in radar and wireless communication. 
Recently it has been demonstrated that its capacity of accounting 
for different scattering conditions encountered in medical 
ultrasound. The probability density function of Nakagami 
distribution is defined as follows[7]:

where E(‧) stands for the expectation. In our previous studies, it 
has been demonstrated that m parameter owns potential in 
identifying areas of tissue necrosis. Moreover, the calculation of 
m parameter is done over envelope data; thus Nakagami imaging 
has the advantage of low computational complexity, being 
appropriate to implement in any real-time array imaging system. 
C. Experiments Setup  
Ex vivo experiments on porcine livers were preformed. A 2-
MHz FUS transducer was used to perform the thermal ablation 
and a clinical ultrasound scanner was employed to collect RF 
data during FUS thermal ablation (see figure 1). The scanner 
settings were center frequency of 5MHz, sampling frequency of 
20MHz, imaging depth of 5cm, and data size of 1300*256 points. 
A fresh porcine liver in the tank was preheated till 30℃ and used 
Poly-Acrylamide to fix in square mold. The heating time was set 
to 1.8 second and then stopped 1.2 second for capturing RF data 
for further analysis. Each cycle was 3 second and there were 20 
cycles (60 seconds) for the total heating time. Finally, the 
pictures of the ablated tissue sections wre taken to record location 
of the tissue coagulation. 
  
Fig. 1.  Experiment setup. 
III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
A. Results of temperature estimation 
Experimental results show that the ultrasonic temperature 
estimation can work before tissue is denatured. Figure 2(a) and 
2(c)  show that when temperature is lower than tissue necrotic 
level (<50 oC), a precise temperature mapping can be provided; 
however, ultrasonic temperature estimation fails when 
temperature rise is higher than necrotic level, as shown in figure 
2(b). Thus, ultrasonic temperature estimation in low temperature 
variance can be used to locate the treatment area.
