Abstract 
This study focuses on the investigation of a solid oxide 
fuel cell unit (SOFC) in the cross-flow configuration with 
considering the reforming and water gas shift reaction, and 
discusses the variation of molar fraction of hydrogen, current 
density distribution, and temperature distribution due to the 
two reactions.  This study applies a software package to solve 
the mass conservation, energy conservation, and 
electrochemical reaction equations of a SOFC unit, 
simultaneously.  Moreover, this study investigates the effect 
of reforming and water gas shift reaction on the performance of 
the SOFC unit when the fuel inlet molar flow rate is 
non-uniform profile on the frontal area, which are Pattern A 
and B.  The results show that the reforming reaction increases 
the local current density of SOFC about 1~16%, but the water 
gas shift reaction have little effect on the current density and 
can be neglected.  Moreover, the average current densities at 
different inlet patterns are similar, but Pattern A causes the 
most uniform current density distribution and Pattern B causes 
the worst current density distribution.  In the temperature field, 
the reforming reaction will decrease the cell temperature due to 
its exothermic reaction, and water gas shift reaction has little 
effect on the cell temperature.

Introduction 
A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is composed of an anode, 
a cathode, an electrolyte, and two inter-connectors containing 
the fuel and air channels.  Its operating temperature is close to 
600~1000 °C.  Because of the high operating temperature, the 
SOFC has reforming reaction for methane in the anode side 
and produces more hydrogen for the electrochemical reaction.  
Therefore, the selection of fuel in a SOFC is wider than that in 
other kinds of fuel cells.  Moreover, the solid electrolyte of a 
SOFC has stronger stiffness, so the SOFC can be formed in a 
plate or tube shape structure.  For producing larger electric 
power in a stationary power generation plant, the SOFC is 
usually stacked one by one of plate units. 
In the anode side of a SOFC unit, the fuel includes 
chemical species of methane, gas water, and carbon monoxide, 
which can progress the reforming reaction and water gas shift 
reaction under the operating temperature of a SOFC.  In the 
research of the reforming reaction, there are many literatures to 
be published in recent two decades.  Some of them investigate 
the model of reforming reaction rate in a SOFC [1-7].  Other 
literatures apply software to analyze the thermal and electrical 
performance of a SOFC with considering the reforming 
reaction [8-15].  In the research of water gas shift reaction, the 
investigating fields include building the expression of water 
gas shift reaction rate, analyzing the balance problem of 
forward and backward water gas shift reaction in a SOFC, 
investigating the effect of water gas shift reaction on a molten 
carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) and a SOFC, as well as discusses 
the water gas shift reaction in a proton exchange membrane 
fuel cell [16-20]. 
Authors had investigated the effect of non-uniform inlet 
flow rate of the fuel and air on the current density and cell 
temperature distribution in a unit or stack of SOFC and MCFC 
[21-24], and our numerical method had been proved and it is 
reliable.  According to the above review, previous literatures 
find the expressions of reaction rate of reforming and water gas 
shift reaction, and investigate the effect of reforming and water 
gas shift reaction on a fuel cell when the inlet flow is uniform.  
Moreover, most literature focuses on an analysis for a SOFC 
with co-flow or counter-flow, and few of them consider the 
flow arrangement of a SOFC as a cross-flow.  This reason is 
that the co-flow or counter-flow of a SOFC can be simulated in 
a one-dimensional model, but the cross-flow of a SOFC must 
be in a two-dimensional model, which is more complicated in 
the analysis.  Therefore, this study applies the expression of 
reaction rate in previous literature to investigate the effect of 
reforming and water gas shift reaction on the thermal and 
electrical performance of a SOFC unit in the cross-flow 
configuration when the inlet fuel flow is uniform and 
non-uniform pattern. 
 
Analysis 
The schematic diagram of a SOFC unit considered in this 
study is shown in Fig. 1.  This unit includes two 
inter-connectors with fuel channels and air channels, as well as 
a cell combining the anode, the electrolyte, and the cathode.  
The fuel flows along the x direction, and the air flows along the 
y direction, which is cross-flow configuration.  Because the 
scale in the z direction is special smaller than that in x or y 
direction, this study ignores the variation of variables in the 
thickness direction.  That means the mathematical model of 
this study is two-dimensional.  Moreover, this study neglects 
the structure of channels of fuel and air, because these channels 
are intensive distributed in the inter-connector.  Therefore, the 
fuel and air flow through overall reaction area in the 
mathematical model.  Other assumptions in this study are 
following: inlet temperatures and mole fractions of species in 
fuel and air are constant and uniform; cell and inter-connector 
boundary are adiabatic; cell voltage is uniform over the x-y 
plane. 
In the fuel side, the reaction equations include the 
electrochemistry reactions, reforming reaction, and water gas 
shift reaction.

This study does not consider the electrochemical oxidation of 
CO, because the electrochemical oxidation of hydrogen is 
faster than that of CO [25].  The reaction in the air side is as

The combination of fuel species is CH4(11%), H2O(33%), 
CO(5%), H2(33%), CO2(6%), N2(12%), and the combination of 
air species is O2(22%), N2 (78%).  Moreover, this study builds 
the mass conservation equation for solving the mole fraction 
change of each specie in the fuel and air sides.

Meanwhile, the Sj stands for the reaction rate of reactants and 
resultants.  These reaction rate can be expressed in following:

the cell temperature close the inlet side of fuel and air becomes 
lower due to the cooling effect.  The cell temperature in this 
analysis case is from 640 to 730 C .  In this figure, the cell 
temperature profile of green line and red line are higher than 
that of blue line.  Because the reforming reaction is a kind of 
endothermic reaction and its reaction heat is apparently larger 
than the exothermic of water gas shift reaction, the cell 
temperature will drop down due to the reforming reaction in 
the fuel side.  Examining the data of Fig. 3 indicates that the 
cell temperature variation due to the reforming reaction is close 
to 15 C  occurring at the exit corner and below 5 C  
occurring at the air inlet side. 
Figure 4 shows the hydrogen molar flow rate distribution 
in the fuel side in different cases.  In this figure, the green line 
and blue line represents the cases without water gas shift 
reaction, and its hydrogen molar flow rate profile smoothly 
decrease along the fuel flow direction.  Moreover, the blue 
line profile is higher than the green line profile, because the 
reforming reaction transforms the methane to the hydrogen in 
the blue line case.  Examining the data of molar flow rate of 
hydrogen in blue line and green line case indicates that the 
reforming reaction can promote the hydrogen concentration 6% 
at the fuel exit.  The red line profile has a step jump of 
hydrogen molar flow rate in the fuel inlet, because the water 
gas shift reaction has a rapid reaction rate. 
 Because the manifold results to a non-uniform inlet 
molar flow on the frontal area and the fuel dominates the 
electrical performance of a SOFC [22, 23], this study considers 
a progressively increasing and decreasing profile along the y 
direction in the fuel inlet.  This study names them as Pattern A 
and Pattern B, and names the uniform profile as Pattern U, 
which are shown in Fig. 5.  Meanwhile, the character d 
represents non-uniform profile deviation, i.e., the flow rate 
varies from )1( dn   to )1( dn  along the y direction.  
The symbol, n , stands for the average molar flow rate on the 
frontal area of the inlet.  Figure 6 shows the current density 
distribution on the reaction area in Pattern A and B, as well as 
the fuel molar flow rate is 0.009 mol s
-1
.  In this figure, the 
green and black lines represent the current density distribution 
without and with both reforming and water gas shift reaction, 
respectively.  This figure shows that the current density 
variation in Pattern A is from 5426 A m
-2
s
-1
 to 4564 A m
-2
s
-1
, 
and that in Pattern B is from 5463 to 4220 A m
-2
s
-1
.  The 
average current density in Pattern A is higher than that in 
Pattern B, so the electrical performance of progressively 
increasing profile of inlet flow is better than that of 
progressively decreasing profile.  Moreover, this figure 
indicates that the change rate of average current density due to 
the reforming and water gas shift reaction is close to 1.5%, and 
the local change rate is under 4%. 
 Figures 7 and 8 show the current density distribution in 
Pattern A and B with fuel molar flow rate of 0.0045 and 
0.00338 mol s
-1
, respectively.  In Fig. 7, the change rate of 
average current density is close to 2.7%, and the local change 
rate is under 10%.  In Fig. 8, the change rate of average 
current density is close to 3.6%, and the local change rate is 
under 16%.  Comparing Figs. 6 to 8 indicates that the change 
rate of average current density due to the reaction of reforming 
and water gas shift increases from 1% to 4%, and local change 
rate increases from 4% to 16% with the decrease of fuel molar 
flow rate when the inlet molar flow rate of the fuel is 
non-uniform.  When the fuel molar flow rate is 0.009 mol s
-1
, 
the average current density will arise about 70 A m
-2
s
-1
 as well 
as the local current density arise about 200 A m
-2
s

.  Once the 
fuel molar flow rate decreases to 0.0045 and 0.00338 mol s
-1
, 
the average current density will arise about 130 and 170 A/m
2
s 
as well as the local current density arise about 400 and 550 A

s

 due to the reaction of reforming and water gas shift.  
Therefore, the effect of reforming and water gas shift reaction 
on the electrical performance of a SOFC becomes more 
important when the fuel inlet flow rate is smaller. 
Figure 9 shows the average current density versus 
voltage of the SOFC unit with or without reforming and water 
gas shift reaction when the inlet molar flow rate of fuel is 
uniform and equals 0.0045 mol s
-1
.  Meanwhile, the green 
dashed line, blue solid line, and red dotted line stand for the 
analysis cases of without both reforming and water gas shift 
reaction, only with reforming reaction, and only with water gas 
shift reaction, respectively.  In this figure, it shows that the 
reforming reaction can promote the performance of a SOFC 
due to its hydrogen generation, and the water gas shift reaction 
almost has not any effect on the performance of a SOFC.  The 
water gas shift reaction only changes the assembly of species 
in the fuel side, but do not affect the performance of a SOFC 
unit. 
Figure 10 shows the current density distribution of a 
SOFC unit with both the reforming and water gas shift reaction 
when the inlet molar flow rate is 0.0045 mol s
-1
 at different 
patterns, which are Pattern A, B, and U.  Examining the data 
of average current density indicates that all of them are similar, 
but the current density distribution profile in this figure is 
different to each other.  The profiles based on uniform 
comparison in the rank are the blue, green, and red line, 
respectively.  This means that the Pattern A has the best 
current density distribution in a SOFC unit.  For a designer of 
the manifold of a fuel cell, the inlet duct should be arranged in 
the position far from the air inlet side, and it can produce the 
progressively increasing inlet profile and result more uniform 
current density distribution. 
 
Conclusions 
This study applies a software to analyze the change of 
reacting gas, current density, and cell temperature in a SOFC 
unit with considering the reforming and water gas shift reaction 
in the anode side.  Moreover, this study considers two 
non-uniform patterns of inlet fuel flow due to the manifold, 
which are progressively increasing and decreasing profile 
along the y direction.  The results show that water gas shift 
reaction has less effect than the reforming reaction on the 
species’ concentration, current density, and cell temperature of 
a SOFC, as well as the reforming reaction can product more 
hydrogen and hence promote about 1~16% of local current 
density for a SOFC unit for different analysis cases in this 
study.  Although the non-uniform patterns of the inlet fuel 
flow has little effect on the average of current density, Pattern 
A can produce a more uniform current density distribution than 
the uniform pattern does.  Therefore, the progressively 
increasing inlet profile is a better choice for a SOFC, and the 
inlet duct should be arranged far from the air inlet in the design 
of a manifold of fuel side.  In the temperature field, the 
reforming reaction will decrease the cell temperature due to its 
exothermic reaction, and water gas shift reaction has little 
effect on the cell temperature.
