2. PROPOSED APPROACH 
 
Figure 2 shows the proposed watermarking 
system. First, user can choose one of the BIBD 
patterns in the BIBD database as the desired 
watermark. Then, the watermark is added to the 
DWT coefficients of the cover image. After the 
embedding stage, the watermarked image is 
transmitted to the receiver. Finally, the BIBD 
watermark is extracted and recognized by detection 
rules at the receiver site. 
 
2.1. Watermark Design and Recognition 
 
The incidence matrix of the BIBD is adopted as 
the proposed watermark. The incidence matrix of a 
BIBD is defined by the five parameters, namely, v, k, 
r, b, λ. Only three parameters are independent, that is, 
v, k, and λ [14]; the other two parameters, r and b, 
can be derived based on the former three [14]. 
However, the three independent parameters, v, k, and 
λ, are not adequate to describe all the characteristics 
of the BIBD incidence matrix. The characteristics of 
the BIBD incidence matrix are described more 
clearly through the second parameter k and third 
parameter λ. But the first variable v is not 
comparable since it is already known as one of the 
dimensions of the incidence matrix. Thus, in this 
work, the parameter r is selected as a substitute for 
the parameter v. 
The recognition of the BIBD incidence matrix is 
not only determined by the individual rule for the 
three parameters but also by the weights of their 
linear combination. A relation among the three 
parameters can be found as follows. 
 
λ×=×=×= vCbkvrT 2 ,                   
(1) 
 
where vC2  is the number of 2-subsets of the set V, 
and T is the number of ones in the BIBD incidence 
matrix. Therefore, the three weights indicating the 
relative importance of the three parameters may be 
treated as the same, that is, the value of one third is 
assigned to all the three weights. 
The three recognition rules are explained as 
follows. Eq. (2) is the rule for checking the structure 
represented by the parameter r.

,where Ei means the bit error rate of the ith row of 
the extracted BIBD watermark compared with the ith 
row of the predicted BIBD watermark, and V  the 
number of rows in the BIBD incidence matrix. The 
recognition rule for the parameter r concerns not 
only the number of the value of ones in each row, but 
also, if they are correctly or incorrectly located. 
The following is Eq. (3) which shows the rule for 
recognizing the structure information of the 
parameter k.

4. Conclusions 
 
In this work, a new approach to BIBD-based 
watermark design has been proposed. The 
corresponding recognition rules have also been 
designed based on utilizing the structure information 
of the proposed watermark. Under Gaussian noise, 
the experimental results show that the true positive 
rate and the false negative rate of the proposed 
watermark are both better than those of the random 
pattern which is the general form of practical 
watermarks. Future works are suggested to conduct 
experiments on the false positive rate and to develop 
more complicated models of the recognition rules.
