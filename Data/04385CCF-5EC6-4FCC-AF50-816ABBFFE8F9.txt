expression. However, during in vitro culture, the 
exposure of keratocytes to serum often results in 
the loss of characteristic morphology and 
biosynthetic ability [3]. Teixeira et al. have 
shown that human keratocytes cultured on the 
nanoscale patterns have fewer stress fibers and 
focal adhesions than those on synthetic 
microstructured surfaces or smooth substrates 
[4]. Hence, the nanoscale substrate topographies 
are thought to be involved in the inhibition of 
the keratocyte-myofibroblast transdifferentiation 
under serum-containing culture conditions. 
Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a linear anionic 
polysaccharide composed of long chains of 
repeating disaccharide units of D-glucuronic 
acid and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. In the eye, it 
is mainly found in the vitreous body and in a 
much lower concentration in the aqueous humor. 
Therefore, HA-based ophthalmic biomaterials 
have attracted growing attention. In this study, 
we further propose the use of HA as ECM 
coating for cultivation of corneal keratocytes. 
The HA with a molecular weight (MW) 
ranging from thousands to several millions may 
show different cell-signaling events and 
biological effects on cells [5]. Park et al. have 
reported that after coating with HA of different 
MWs, the substrates present distinct surface 
nanotopographies, thereby influencing the 
gap-junctional intercellular communications of 
cultured human dermal fibroblasts [6]. However, 
to the best of our knowledge, the effects of 
nanometer feature of HA coatings on the 
keratocyte behavior are yet to be investigated. 
The purpose of this work was to evaluate the 
rabbit corneal keratocyte (RCK) growth in 
response to nanostructured HA surfaces under 
serum-free conditions. The polystyrene (PS) 
plates were coated with HA of varying MWs 
(35-1500 kDa) and were characterized by 
atomic force microscopy (AFM) and contact 
angle measurements. The cell proliferation and 
morphology were studied to give insight into the 
roles of nanotopographic ECM cues in 
cell-material interaction. The multicellular 
spheroids formed on rougher HA surfaces were 
also observed to quantify their size and number. 
Subsequently, the cell phenotype and 
biosynthetic capacity were respectively 
determined by gene expression level and ECM 
production. 
 
Experimental 
 
Preparation of HA-coated culture substrates 
A 1 mg/ml aqueous solution of HA (1 ml) 
was poured in a well of a 24-well plate and 
air-dried for 3 days at 25°C. 
 
Atomic force microscopy 
AFM was utilized to scan surface 
topography and to determine the root mean 
square roughness (Rq) for each sample. 
 
Contact angle measurements 
To determine the surface wettability, the 
contact angles of various test samples were 
measured using a contact angle goniometer. 
 
Corneal keratocyte culture 
Adult male New Zealand white rabbits 
were used for this study. All animal procedures 
were approved by the Institutional Review 
Board and were performed in accordance with 
the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in 
Ophthalmic and Vision Research. The RCKs 
were maintained in regular culture medium 
consisting of defined KSFM and 1% A/A 
solution. Cultures were incubated in a 
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C. 
 
Cell proliferation assays 
RCKs with a density of 5 × 104 cells/ml 
were seeded into 24-well TCPS and various 
HA-coated plates by 1 ml/well, and incubated at 
37°C for specific time periods. 
The cellular morphology of RCKs on 
culture substrates was observed by means of 
inverted phase-contrast microscopy and SEM. 
The number of RCKs attached to the sample 
surface was determined by the MTT assay. 
 
Extracellular matrix production 
After RCK cultivation on TCPS and 
various HA-coated plates for 1-5 days, the 
supernatants were collected for analyses of 
collagen and GAG contents. 
 
Quantitative real-time reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction analyses 
After RCK cultivation on TCPS and 
various HA-coated plates for 5 days, the total 
RNA was isolated from cells and quantitative 
RT-PCR was performed. 
 
Cell proliferation assays 
After 1 day of incubation, the cultures on 
both the TCPS and HA35 surfaces consisted of 
keratocytes with interconnecting processes that 
form a communicating network (Figure 3A&B). 
On day 5, the cell density of the HA35 groups 
was higher than that of the TCPS groups, 
indicating that the polysaccharide coatings 
seemed beneficial to RCK growth. As revealed 
by SEM observations, the cells had a 
characteristic morphology distinct from that of 
spindle-shaped fibroblasts in serum-containing 
medium. Here, the nanostructured HA360 and 
HA1500 coatings with relatively low contact 
angles and enhanced surface hydrophilicities 
hindered cell spreading and subsequent cell 
proliferation (Figure 3C&D). The multicellular 
spheroids remained as rounded aggregates and 
were stable within 1-5 days of growth. Under 
SEM, all the RCKs were also found to be 
interconnected and entangled. 
Figure 3E shows the results of proliferation 
test of RCKs. With increasing incubation time 
from 1 to 5 days, the cell number was 
significantly increased for both TCPS and HA35 
groups (P < 0.05) and insignificantly increased 
for both HA360 and HA1500 groups (P > 0.05). 
Kim et al. have shown that in comparison with 
high MW (i.e., 200 kDa) HA, low MW (50 kDa) 
counterpart may provide favorable living 
environment for human mesenchymal stem cell 
proliferation [8]. The present data are 
compatible with their findings, and suggest that 
the RCKs can actively proliferate on the 
HA-coatings with low surface nanoroughness. It 
is of interest to note that when the Rq ≥ 1.1 nm, 
the cultured cells were almost mitotically 
quiescent, similar to those observed in vivo. 
Additionally, the RCKs within the spheroids 
formed on the HA360 surfaces exhibited higher 
metabolic activity (i.e., MTT value) than those 
obtained on the HA1500 coatings. These results 
support the report by Lim et al. showing that 
bone cell adhesion and proliferation are greater 
for the randomly distributed island topography 
with decreased nanoscale height [9]. Our 
findings indicate that the differences in 
keratocyte configuration (i.e., 2D monolayer or 
3D spheroid) and proliferation behavior can be 
controlled by substratum characteristic such as 
nanotopography.

groups. Scale bars indicate 100 μm (LM) and 20 μm (SEM). (E) Total 
cell number on various substrates after RCK seeding for 1, 3, and 5 
days. An asterisk indicates statistically significant differences (*P < 
0.05; n = 4) versus TCPS (compared only within each time point group). 
 
Extracellular matrix production 
It is known that the corneal stroma consists 
of keratocytes and ECM components such as 
collagen and GAGs. Therefore, in this study, the 
biosynthetic capacity of cultured cells was 
assessed by measuring the collagen and GAGs 
in the medium supernatants (Figure 4). For each 
type of substrate, the amounts of both collagen 
and GAG production were significantly 
increased with increasing incubation time from 
1 to 5 days (P < 0.05), indicating that the cells 
continuously synthesize and deposit their own 
ECM components. Brammer et al. have 
investigated the in vitro bovine cartilage 
chondrocyte response to the different nanoscale 
dimensions and concluded that the 
nanotopography of TiO2 nanotube structures 
may trigger enhanced overall production of 
ECM components over flat Ti control surfaces 
[10]. The results of biochemical examination 
presented in this work are consistent with these 
to make the spheroidal cell aggregates 
quiescent, and thereby contributing to the 
cellular transparency. On the other hand, with 
GAPDH as an internal control, the mRNA 
expression of a neural progenitor cell marker, 
nestin, was significantly higher by the RCKs 
cultured on both HA360 and HA1500 surfaces 
than on TCPS plates (P < 0.05). In particular, 
the nestin expression reached the highest level 
on the island-shaped nanostructures (i.e., Rq = 
1.7 nm) with 1396% amplification over the HA 
samples having the lowest surface 
nanoroughness (i.e., Rq = 0.3 nm). Our data 
demonstrate that the larger-sized RCK spheroids 
exhibit a notably higher nestin expression, 
indicating a greater self-renewal potential.

RCKs grown on TCPS and various HA-coated samples for 5 days by 
real-time RT-PCR. Normalization was done by using GAPDH. Data in 
the experimental groups are percentages relative to that of TCPS groups. 
An asterisk indicates statistically significant differences (*P < 0.05; n = 
3) as compared to the TCPS groups. 
 
Conclusions 
 
In summary, we have demonstrated that 
under serum-free conditions, the in vitro 
cultured RCKs on HA coatings can sense 
nanotopographic ECM cues. Surface roughness 
and hydrophilicity are crucial for regulating the 
cell behaviors such as cell adhesion, spreading, 
and proliferation. In addition, the keratocyte 
configuration (i.e., 2D monolayer or 3D 
spheroid) affects the biosynthetic capacity and 
gene expression of the cells. When grown on the 
HA surfaces with Rq of 1.1-1.7 nm, the viable 
RCKs spontaneously aggregate to form 
multicellular spheroids, which are almost 
mitotically quiescent with enhanced phenotypes 
and found to exhibit greater amounts of collagen 
and GAG production. These features, similar to 
those of keratocytes in vivo, may allow the cell 
spheroids to be further used as potential 
therapeutic transplants.

lumican and lower expressions of biglycan, similar to those of keratocytes in vivo. Moreover, 
the expression levels of corneal crystallin aldehyde dehydrogenase (7~9-fold increase) and 
nestin (10~16-fold increase) were greater in larger-sized spheroids, indicating higher ability 
to maintain cellular transparency and self-renewal potential. It is concluded that the cultured 
RCKs on surfaces coated with HA of different MWs can sense ECM cues, and the 
multicellular spheroids may potentially be used for corneal stromal tissue engineering 
applications.

keratocytes exhibit dendritic morphology and maintain phenotypic expression. However, 
during in vitro culture, the exposure of keratocytes to serum often results in the loss of 
characteristic morphology and biosynthetic ability [7]. Teixeira et al. have previously shown 
that human keratocytes cultured on the nanoscale patterns have fewer stress fibers and focal 
adhesions than those on synthetic microstructured surfaces or smooth substrates [8]. Hence, 
the nanoscale substrate topographies are thought to be involved in the inhibition of the 
keratocyte-myofibroblast transdifferentiation under serum-containing culture conditions. 
These encouraging results motivate us to develop the surface ECM coating that featured a 
functionality to affect keratocyte morphology and gene regulation. 
Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a linear anionic polysaccharide composed of long chains of 
repeating disaccharide units of D-glucuronic acid and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. In the eye, it 
is mainly found in the vitreous body and in a much lower concentration in the aqueous humor. 
Therefore, HA-based ophthalmic biomaterials have attracted growing attention. Due to its 
high capacity for lubrication, water sorption and water retention, HA-containing artificial tear 
has been used in a clinical trial for improved ocular surface damage associated with dry eye 
syndrome [9]. During cataract surgery [10] or deep lamellar keratoplasty [11], intracameral 
injection of viscoelastic HA can maintain anterior chamber depth and protect the corneal 
endothelium. Recently, in our laboratory, carbodiimide cross-linked HA hydrogels have been 
applied as carriers for delivery of bioengineered corneal endothelial cell sheets [12]. In vitro 
 6
HA-treated surfaces were observed to quantify their size and number as well as to check cell 
viability. Subsequently, the cell phenotype and biosynthetic capacity were respectively 
determined by gene expression level and ECM production. 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Materials 
Hyaluronic acid sodium salt of medical grade was obtained from Lifecore Biomedical 
(Chaska, MN, USA) as a dry powder. It was manufactured using a microbial fermentation 
process, and was highly purified. According to information from the supplier, the HA samples 
used as raw materials had a weight-average MW range of 35-1500 kDa. In this study, a 
sample with a weight-average MW of 35 kDa was designated as HA35. Deionized water used 
was purified with a Milli-Q system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). Phosphate-buffered 
saline (PBS, pH 7.4) was acquired from Biochrom (Berlin, Germany). 24-well non-tissue 
culture polystyrene (PS) plates (Falcon 351147) and tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) plates 
(Falcon 353047) were purchased from Becton Dickinson Labware (Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). 
Dispase type II was obtained from Roche (Indianapolis, IN, USA). Collagenase type I, 
chloramine-T reagent, Ehrlich’s aldehyde reagent, and chondroitin sulfate A sodium salt were 
acquired from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Medium 199, gentamicin, defined 
keratinocyte serum-free medium (KSFM), trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 
and TRIzol reagent were purchased from Gibco-BRL (Grand Island, NY, USA). The 
 8
An atomic force microscope (AFM) (NanoScope IV; Veeco Digital Instruments, Santa 
Barbara, CA, USA) located at the Instrument Center of National Sun Yat-sen University 
(Kaohsiung, Taiwan, ROC) was utilized to scan surface topography. The samples were 
analyzed in air at room temperature. All measurements were made in tapping mode with a 
silicon cantilever and a scan rate of 0.4 Hz. AFM images were recorded with a scan size of 1 
μm × 1 μm. Five measurements were done on different surface sites to calculate the root 
mean square roughness (Rq) for each sample. Results were averaged on three independent 
runs. 
2.5. Contact angle measurements 
To determine the wettability, the surface water contact angles of various test samples 
were measured at 25°C with the sessile drop method using a contact angle goniometer (G-1; 
Erma, Tokyo, Japan). A deionized water droplet of 2 μl was carefully placed on the substrate 
surfaces and the images were photographed after 1 min. The contact angles between the 
baseline of the water droplet and the tangent at the drop boundary were read. For each contact 
angle determination, ten measurements were taken on different surface sites, and the mean 
was calculated. Results were averaged on six independent runs. 
2.6. Corneal keratocyte culture 
Ten adult male New Zealand white rabbits (National Laboratory Animal Breeding and 
Research Center, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC) weighing 2.5-3.0 kg were used for this study. All 
 10
various HA-coated plates by 1 ml/well, and incubated in regular culture medium at 37°C for 
specific time periods (1 and 8 h for cell adhesion assays, and 1, 3, 5 days for cell proliferation 
assays). 
The cellular morphology of RCKs on culture substrates was observed by means of 
inverted phase-contrast microscopy (Nikon, Melville, NY, USA) and scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM). After washing the plates three times with PBS to remove non-attached 
cells, the bottom of the wells were photographed. The samples were processed for SEM 
observations in conformity with described procedures [21]. Briefly, after incubation for 8 h 
and 5 days, the cell cultures were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylic acid 
buffer (pH 7.4) overnight at 4°C. After rinsing them with 0.1 M cacodylic acid buffer, the 
specimens were post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide and dehydrated in a graded series of 
ethanol solutions. Then, the cell samples were dried with carbon dioxide in a critical point 
dryer (Balzers, Liechtenstein) and coated with gold in a sputter coater (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) 
before examination under a Hitachi S-3000N SEM with an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. 
The number of RCKs attached to the sample surface was determined by the 
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The amount of 
colored formazan product is proportional to the number of metabolically active cells [22]. For 
staining, the cultures were incubated with fresh culture medium containing 0.5 mg/ml of 
MTT reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 h at 37°C in the dark. DMSO was added to each well to 
 12
hydroxyproline in aqueous humor [18]. In brief, after hydrolysis with 6 N HCl for 18 h at 
110°C, the samples were mixed with a buffered chloramine-T reagent, and the oxidation was 
allowed to proceed for 25 min at room temperature. After the addition of Ehrlich’s aldehyde 
reagent to each sample, the absorbance was read at 550 nm by using a spectrophotometer 
(ThermoLabsystems) and compared with a standard calibration curve to quantify the amount 
of hydroxyproline. All experiments were conducted in triplicate. 
The GAG content was determined by colorimetric assay according to the procedure of 
Hoemann et al. [23]. Briefly, the samples were mixed with DMMB reagent solution (40 mM 
NaCl; 40 mM glycine; 46 μM DMMB, pH 3.0). The absorbance was read at 525 nm by using 
a spectrophotometer (ThermoLabsystems), and referenced to a standard curve of chondroitin 
sulfate A over a range of concentrations from 0.1 to 50 μg/ml. All experiments were 
conducted in triplicate. 
2.10. Cell viability assays 
RCKs (5 × 104 cells/well) were seeded into 24-well TCPS and various HA-coated plates 
containing 1 ml of regular culture medium and incubated at 37°C for 5 days. Cell viability 
was determined using a membrane integrity assay, the Live/Dead Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit 
(Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) which contains calcein AM and ethidium 
homodimer-1 (EthD-1) [24]. It depends on the intracellular esterase activity to identify the 
living cells, which cleaves the calcein AM to produce a green fluorescence. In dead cells,

Results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Comparative studies of means 
were performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Significance was accepted 
with P < 0.05. 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Zeta potential measurements 
The surface charge of HA materials was assessed by measuring the electrophoretic 
mobility in a microelectrophoresis flow cell, and the results are presented in Figure 1. The 
zeta potential of all test samples was negative because these HA molecules have carboxylic 
functional groups. When diluted in water at pH greater than the pKa of HA (i.e., 2.9), the HA 
chains carry negative charges [26]. Our results showed that there were significant differences 
in surface charge between HA35 (-16.0 ± 1.8 mV), HA360 (-25.4 ± 2.3 mV), and HA1500 
(-46.5 ± 1.7 mV) groups (P < 0.05). A study from Zhang et al. demonstrated that HA with a 
MW of 400 kDa is measured to have an average zeta potential of -20 mV [27]. The present 
data are in line with their findings. For a series of negatively charged HA samples, the 
increase of the absolute zeta potential values was observed with increasing polysaccharide 
MW. In order to further evaluate the zeta potential under physiological conditions, the 
measurements were also performed in culture medium. A similar trend was found for the 
effect of MW of HA on zeta potential variation. It is of interest to note that significantly 
higher values for samples with the same MW were detected in water than those measured in 
 16
HA-coated samples ranged from 0.3 to 1.7 nm. With increasing the MW of HA, the Rq 
values significantly increased (P < 0.05). It has been reported that rough surface topography 
for the chitosan with higher MW is probably related to the supramolecular structures of 
biopolymers [32]. In accordance with these earlier observations, our data imply that an 
aggregated structure of high MW HA molecules can substantially increase surface roughness. 
3.3. Contact angle measurements 
The contact angle was measured to examine the surface hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity 
of the TCPS and various HA-coated plates. As shown in Figure 3A, the water droplets of all 
the HA groups exhibited stronger adhesion to the surfaces than did those of TCPS groups. 
Since HA is a highly hygroscopic molecule, our findings clearly demonstrate that the culture 
substrates coated with HA enhance surface hydrophilicity. For standard TCPS substrates, the 
static contact angle was found to be 65.2 ± 0.8° (Figure 3B). The results are consistent with 
previous studies that TCPS has sessile drop water contact angle of 65.8° [33]. The present 
data also showed that there were significant differences in contact angle between HA35 (58.3 
± 0.7°), HA360 (48.8 ± 0.8°), and HA1500 (34.1 ± 1.2°) groups (P < 0.05), supporting the 
notion that surface wettability is highly associated with MW of coating material. Van Beek et 
al. have demonstrated that for the poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) membranes modified 
with HA of higher MW, the migration of free polysaccharide chains to the interface is 
responsible for creating a rougher and more hydrophilic surface [34]. Furthermore, the 
 18
nonadherent round-shaped morphology. With increasing cultivation time, the RCKs gradually 
spread over the HA35 surfaces, but dynamically aggregated to form multicellular spheroids 
on both the HA360 and HA1500 surfaces, indicating that the MW of coating materials may 
play an important role in the modulation of cell adhesion. At high magnification under SEM, 
the RCK cultures were amassed into complex formations when in contact with high MW (i.e., 
≥ 360 kDa) HA-treated surfaces. The individual cells within the round-shaped spheroids were 
intact and packed together tightly. 
The results of adhesion of RCKs to various substrates are shown in Figure 4E. After 1 h 
of plating, the cell adhesion ratio from TCPS groups was 86.3 ± 2.4%, which was 
significantly higher than all the other groups (P < 0.05). In addition, 27.6-52.8% reductions in 
cell number were found for all the HA-coated samples as compared to initial cell seeding 
density. With increasing surface nanoroughness of dry HA coatings, the cell adhesion ratios 
markedly decreased (P < 0.05). For each type of substrate, the amount of adherent cells did 
not change over incubation time in the range of 1-8 h (P > 0.05), suggesting that RCK 
adhesion to biomaterials may be determined during the initial cell attachment phase. It has 
been reported that the short-term osteoblast adhesion observed at 3 h can mainly be attributed 
to nonspecific electrostatic interactions between the material surfaces and the cells [32]. 
Therefore, in this study, a high resistance to cell attachment activity was noted probably due 
to a repulsion effect of the negatively charged cell surface proteoglycans towards HA 
 20
groups, a change in cell morphology was noted on day 5. These findings may suggest that the 
PS plates are not suitable for cell/tissue culture use, in accordance with the information from 
the supplier. 
Figure 5E shows the results of proliferation test of RCKs. With increasing incubation 
time from 1 to 5 days, the cell number was significantly increased for both TCPS and HA35 
groups (P < 0.05) and insignificantly increased for both HA360 and HA1500 groups (P > 
0.05). Kim et al. have shown that in comparison with high MW (i.e., 200 kDa) HA, low MW 
(50 kDa) counterpart may provide favorable living environment for human mesenchymal 
stem cell proliferation [39]. The present data are compatible with their findings, and suggest 
that the RCKs can actively proliferate on the surfaces modified with HA of low MW. It is of 
interest to note that when cultured on dry HA coatings with Rq ≥ 1.1 nm, the cells were 
almost mitotically quiescent, similar to those observed in vivo [19]. Additionally, the RCKs 
within the spheroids formed on the HA360 surfaces exhibited higher metabolic activity (i.e., 
MTT value) than those obtained on the HA1500 coatings. These results support the report by 
Lim et al. showing that bone cell adhesion and proliferation are greater for the randomly 
distributed island topography with decreased nanoscale height [40]. Our findings indicate that 
the differences in keratocyte configuration (i.e., 2D monolayer or 3D spheroid) and 
proliferation behavior can be controlled by the polysaccharide MW-related surface properties 
of culture substratum. 
 22
data revealed that on day 5, the diameter of RCK spheroids in the HA360 and HA1500 
groups was 76 ± 7 and 110 ± 5 μm, respectively, indicating large-size cell aggregates. 
Recently, Chen et al. adopted a method to fabricate bovine corneal keratocyte spheroids on 
the chitosan-coated surfaces [43]. Their study showed that the number of formed spheroids 
strongly depends on the cell seeding density. At the same seeding density (i.e., 2.5 × 104 
cells/cm2), the average number of spheroids per well was 53.5 ± 6.4, which was lower than 
the values of 138 ± 8 (for HA360 group) and 99 ± 8 (for HA1500 group) reported here. It is 
possible that the polysaccharide MW-related surface properties of culture substratum may 
have an effect on the formation of multicellular spheroids although this has yet to be 
investigated. In the present paper, we demonstrate the variations of dimension and quantity of 
RCK spheroids during cultivation on the coatings composed of higher MW HA. 
3.7. Extracellular matrix production 
It is known that the corneal stroma consists of keratocytes and ECM components such as 
collagen and GAGs [44]. Therefore, in this study, the biosynthetic capacity of cultured cells 
was assessed by measuring the collagen and GAGs in the medium supernatants. Figure 7A 
and B, respectively, shows the total collagen and GAG contents after RCK growth on TCPS 
and various HA-coated plates over the 5-day culture. For each type of substrate, the amounts 
of both collagen and GAG production were significantly increased with increasing incubation 
time from 1 to 5 days (P < 0.05), indicating that the cells continuously synthesize and deposit 
 24
prominent green fluorescence, indicating living RCK cultures (data not shown). There were 
no red-stained nuclei in either 2D monolayer or 3D spheroid. Even in the interior region of 
multicellular spheroids, almost no dead cells were observed. A study from Lin et al. 
demonstrated that under serum starvation condition, the survival of melanocytes is enhanced 
and can be further ameliorated by growth into spheroidal aggregates [48]. The findings of this 
work also suggest that in the absence of serum, the RCKs cultured on surfaces coated with 
HA of different MWs presented good viability, independent of their configuration. 
In the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, multicellular spheroids have 
attracted much attention for their potential applications. During in vitro cultivation, the 
formed hepatocyte spheroids seem to have upregulated liver-specific functions [49]. However, 
it is generally believed that the oxygen and nutrient diffusion through the cell spheroids is 
closely related to their size effects. The larger the spheroid size, the greater the resistance to 
mass transfer. Lee et al. have reported that some cells are hypoxic in the interior of the 
spherically symmetric mesenchymal stem cell aggregates with a radius greater than 200 μm, 
probably due to limited diffusion capacity of oxygen [50]. As demonstrated by quantification 
of RCK spheroids, the size of multicellular aggregates is below this critical level, thereby 
avoiding the occurrence of hypoxia-induced death. 
3.9. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses 
As reported in the literature, serum-free conditions are more effective in the maintenance 
 26
interactions (i.e., abundant connexin 43 and cadherin 11) may provide signals mediating 
phenotypic enhancement of free-floating pellet cultures of corneal stromal stem cells [56]. In 
another study, Lin et al. have suggested that the morphology of melanocyte spheroids on the 
chitosan membranes is governed by cell dynamics between two competing forces, such as 
cell-cell interaction and cell-substratum interaction [48]. To further clarify the formation of 
RCK spheroids on the high MW HA-modified surfaces, the differences in the expression of 
cell adhesion molecules were investigated. The mRNA expression levels of cadherin 11 (i.e., 
cell-cell adhesion molecule) and integrin β1 (i.e., cell-matrix adhesion molecule) are shown 
in Figure 8B. In the HA35 groups, the cadherin 11 and integrin β1 gene expression of RCKs 
after 5 days of culture was 113.3 ± 9.4 and 90.2 ± 11.7%, respectively. For both the HA360 
and HA1500 groups, the spheroids generated by aggregated cells led to a significant increase 
in cadherin 11 expressions and a significant decrease in integrin β1 expressions. These results 
indicate that the strength of cell-cell adhesion and cell-material adhesion was extremely 
dependent on the polysaccharide MW-related surface properties of culture substratum. 
It is known that quiescent primary keratocytes express abundant mRNA for aldehyde 
dehydrogenase (ALDH), which is a marker involving the maintenance of corneal 
transparency [53]. The corneal crystallin proteins (i.e., ALDH) can minimize the refractive 
index inhomogeneities in the keratocyte cytoplasm [57,58]. In a previous report, while the 
bovine corneal keratocyte spheroids fabricated on chitosan-coated surfaces could maintain 
 28
of culture substratum are crucial for regulating the cell behaviors such as cell adhesion, 
spreading, and proliferation. In addition, the keratocyte configuration (i.e., 2D monolayer or 
3D spheroid) affects the biosynthetic capacity and gene expression of the cells. When grown 
on the surfaces modified with HA of higher MW (i.e., ≥ 360 kDa), the viable RCKs 
spontaneously aggregate to form multicellular spheroids, which are almost mitotically 
quiescent with enhanced phenotypes and found to exhibit greater amounts of collagen and 
GAG production. These features, similar to those of keratocytes in vivo, may allow the cell 
spheroids to be further used as potential therapeutic transplants. The applications of 
multicellular spheroids for corneal stromal tissue reconstruction are currently being 
investigated in a rabbit model.

Title: Development of Biomaterial Carriers for Ocular Tissue Engineering and 
Regenerative Medicine 
 
Dr. Jui-Yang Lai*  
 
Abstract 
 
Recent progress in biomaterial science has stimulated the development of ocular tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. 
Here we presented several biomaterial-based strategies for corneal epithelial and endothelial reconstruction and retinal repair. 
1. Corneal Epithelial Reconstruction Amniotic membrane (AM) is one of the most prevalent natural matrices used for limbal 
epithelial cell (LEC) cultivation and transplantation. To circumvent the drawbacks associated with its application as a scaffold, 
the AM was chemically modified by carbodiimide cross-linking. Our findings suggest that the treatment of AM with optimum 
cross-linker concentration can significantly enhance its mechanical and thermal stability, optical transparency, and resistance 
to collagenase digestion. Additionally, the cross-linked biological tissue is able to support LEC proliferation and preserve 
epithelial progenitor cells in vitro and in vivo. 
2. Corneal Endothelial Reconstruction An efficient carrier for corneal endothelial cell therapy should deliver and retain the 
cell sheet transplants at the site of injury without causing adverse effects. Therefore, we introduced a simple stirring process 
combined with freeze-drying method for the development of porous gelatin hydrogels that can improve the aqueous humor 
circulation. Our findings suggest that the enlarged pore structure allows carrier materials to contain high fraction of mobile 
water and exhibit low resistance to nutrient transport. After implantation in the rabbit anterior chamber, the hydrogels can 
effectively prevent a drastic change of intraocular pressure and achieve satisfactory swelling effect on cell sheet delivery use. 
3. Retinal Repair Intact retinal sheet transplantation can prevent cell loss that is generally associated with the injection of cell 
suspensions or cell aggregates. To overcome the fragility of retinal grafts, the carbodiimide cross-linked gelatin matrices were 
developed as encapsulating carriers for subretinal delivery. Our findings suggest that the cross-linker can be successfully 
applied for chemical modification of gelatin to fabricate structurally stable, bioadhesive and biocompatible hydrogels. In 
addition, these carrier materials have improved delivery functionality during surgical manipulation of retinal sheets.
