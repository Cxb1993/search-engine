Abstract 
This project applies the materials that can 
achieve the effect of experiment to fabricating the 
thermo-buckled micro actuators working in the 
appropriate temperature. This study chooses 
parylene as major materials and successfully 
fabricates a novel diaphragm type thermo-buckled 
microactuator under a working temperature below 
40 .?   
The diaphragm type pumps of sub-mm size 
has driven by a low voltage without apparent 
temperature rise. The micropump has the 
maximum flow rate of 7.05 µm /s. The fabricated 
thermo-buckled type micropump could be 
integrated into the implantable  bio-sensing system 
for microfludic driving, and drug delivery.

It is well known that many micro-valves have no character-

do not close or open until certain volumetric amount (the dead
volume) of working fluid has been pumped into or out of the con-
trolled actuators. This deficiency introduces the delayed time of

2. Design and fabrication
According to the reasons mentioned above, the first step
for making the buckled-type valve to block the working fluid
effectively is to fabricate a microchannel with a circular cross-
section. Fortunately, a newly developed technique of fabricating
SU-8 circular microchannel [6] provides a concise approach to
solve the issue we concerned. The process used a glass capil-
lary or an optical-fiber as a sacrificial material for the circular
microchannel. At least three SU-8 layers were spun and coated as
a structure material surrounding the sacrificial core. Subtly bak-
ing and well-controlled ultraviolet (UV) exposure was operated
to cross-link and strengthen the SU-8 without leaving apparent
residual stress, and the portions of etching windows for stripping
cores were recessed simultaneously. Finally, the SU-8 samples
were immersed in hydrofluoric (HF) acid for certain period of
time would remove the sacrificial glass fiber, and the circular
microchannel was formed.

pe valve with a parylene circular microchannel by
apillary molds in SU-8 resist base. The global size
module is 1 cm × 0.8 cm, and the turn-on angle θ for

rate a novel mechanism of a micro-valve by using
-type circular microchannel. We really find out the
echanism of stopping flow, familiar with our living

ening) states of a flow and manipulate the fluid inside
onding flow channel to pass through or not. This valve

s, just a straight pipeline with a buckled region can
