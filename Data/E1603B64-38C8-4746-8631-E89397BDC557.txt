diagnosis. The second part shown in Fig. 1 is the breast 
region which provides a contextual sense to observe the ROI 
(suspicious area) and considered as the second important 
degree. The third part shown in Fig. 1 is the ROI, which 
includes clustered microcalcifications and considered as the 
most important component.  
Based on these considerations, in this paper we have 
presented the application of JPEG2000 in the coding of 
mammograms. For the JPEG2000 ROI coding method, it is 
necessary to provide the ROI information before coding. In 
order to solve this problem, this paper adopts the fractal for 
extracting the breast region and the microcalcifications within 
the breast region. In order to explore the suitable ROI coding 
for the mammograms, the generic scaling based method and 
the maximum shift (maxshift) method are compared and 
explored. Also the boundary extension for ROI regions to 
achieve lossless quality is also explored. Finally the results 
are also tested for level of acceptance when different 
truncation bitplanes are used.    
 
The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section 2 introduces the fractal based mammogram 
segmentation which partitions the mammogram into 
background, breast region, and lesion region. Section 3 
discusses the two JPEG2000 ROI codings: generic scaling 
based and MAXSHIFT ROI coding. The boundary extension 
requirement for achieving lossless ROI coding is discussed in 
Section 4. The experimental results are discussed in Section 5. 
Finally the conclusions are drawn in Section 6.

2. ROI  SELECTED BY FRACTAL 
In order to do the progressive coding, the first step is to 
extract regions for the representative of different significance. 
In order to do that, we need to extract the breast region and 
the lesion regions from the mammograms. Then the extracted 
regions would be coded with different significance levels. In 
order to extract the breast and lesion regions, the approach 
developed by Chien-Shun Lo [4] will be employed, which 
uses a K-means clustering-based thresholding method and a 
fractal method to identify background, breast and ROIs. The 
K-means clustering method is not described here in detail. 
The fractal method using a calculation of the fractal 
dimension is called the Blanket method [5], which is briefly 
described below. Let )],(,,[ jifji  be the surface of an 
object at location ),( ji  with gray level ),( jif . The 
surface area can be estimated by measuring the volume 
between an upper blanket and a lower blanket where r  is a 
distance above or below the surface and is the scaling factor 
of fractal dimension. The upper and lower blankets are 
defined, respectively, as follows:

Fractal dimension   provides an important indication of the 
existence of ROI. Fractal mapping image could be generated 
by a linear mapping of  pixel by pixel and is used for finding 
the ROI region. 
Based on the approach, the mammograms can be 
segmented into background, the breast, and the lesion regions. 
The background will be considered of the least significance 
and will be coded with the least bit rate. On the other hand, 
the lesion is the most significant region and therefore will be 
coded with nearly lossless quality. In the design, three-levels 
progressive is used, gradually recovering the image from the 
lesion, the breast and the background. As the lesion is the 
most important region, it is considered the ROI and a 
guaranteed high quality coding, ROI coding, is applied.  
 
 
 
output, the results in the low-pass computation would serve 
as the input. This can be seen from the computation of A’ in 
Fig. 3(a) which requires the result in B’. As B’ has been erred 
by the lack of data in non-lesion area, A’ would also be 
deviated from its true value. As a result, we can see that 
although A’ and B’ are in a region with complete data, they 
could not be completely reconstructed, due to this error 
propagation in inverse DWT computation. Similarly, Fig. 3(b) 
shows the situation with the boundary of ROI being high 
frequency bit. The reconstructed ROI can also obtain bits of 
error, such as A’ here, which is not completely reconstructed.  
According to the previous discussion, we can see that for 
one-level of reconstruction, these may have two bits on each 
side of the ROI boundary being damaged. If the image is 
under l-level of DWT transform, the total number of bits 
along each side of the ROI boundary would be 2l. Based on 
this consideration, for the ROI to be perfectly reconstructed, 
it is necessary that the ROI be extended 2l pixels on each of 
the four sides of the boundaries. Only with this proper 
extension, the ROI can be truly completely reconstructed.

5. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  
In order to show the effect of ROI coding, the 
mammograms with and without ROI coding are displayed for 
comparison. Fig. 4 shows an ROI image which is coded at 
0.02 bpp, where 4(a) is the original ROI, 4(b) is the image 
under JPEG2000 without ROI coding, and 4(c) is JPEG ROI 
coded. From Fig. 4, it can be observed that JPEG 2000 ROI 
coding provides higher quality of ROI. It is also found that 
ROI selection by fractal method can effectively extract the 
microcalcification regions as the ROI, significantly 
improving the ROI quality in very low bit rate.

by using JPEG2000 ROI coding. 
 
 We also display the whole breast image under progressive 
transmissions in Fig. 5. Fig. 5(a) shows the image displayed 
under the transmission data up to 5242 bytes. This means that 
the client gets this image about 0.03 second in the bandwidth 
of 1 Mbps. We can see that  owing to ROI coding, the ROI 
can be displayed clearly even when a small amount of data are 
received. Fig. 5(b) and 5(c) show the followed progressive 
results. We can see that as more bits are received, the image 
obtains higher quality in the breast region. 
 
 
 
progressive transmission and display used in PACS for 
telemammography. In the further study, we expect this idea 
could be extend to other medical image as a general method.
