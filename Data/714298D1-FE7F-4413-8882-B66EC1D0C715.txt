線性化和功率效率化對於寬頻操作的功率放大器而言是非常重要的特性，因此在設計上這
些特性總是被高度重視。尤其是在目前的無線通訊系統中，寬頻操作是主流的趨勢。然而，
高線性化的功率放大器通常非常昂貴。為了解決此一問題，額外的低成本輔助電路，在維
持高功率效率的前提下，通常被用來設計功率放大器的線性化電路。本計畫的第一年，我
們將首先分析降低峰值-均值比例演算法對於不同功率放大器的非線性失真特性，且同時考
慮兩個家族的降低峰值-均值比例演算法：裁減法與壓縮法。基於對以上兩個家族演算法對
於功率放大器的非線性影響分析，完成系統參數的初步設計。再此同時，我們也將對此系
統參數的初步設計在 
1) 線性與非線性之失真， 
2) 系統複雜度，與 
3) 調適能力與調適過程之收斂速度 
等各方面的交互作用與權衡消長，可以有更進一步的了解。除此之外，本計畫也幫助正交
分頻多工系統做信號的調變設計，讓發射信號的峰值-均值比例降低以便進一步改進功率放
大器的線性特性。 
 
“反失真”與降低“峰值-均值比例”演算法很少一同被設計考量，反失真與降低峰值-均值比例
演算法是可以互相改善功率放大器的非線性失真，1) 一方面，本計畫設計的線性化電路不
但考慮了功率放大器的非線性特性，也顧及了正交分頻多工系統發射信號之統計特性。2)
另一方面，本計畫設計的線性化電路之基頻部分需要在反失真演算法與降低峰值-均值比例
演算法中做參數的互相信號處理。本計畫接續企圖建立一個結合降低“峰值-均值比例”與“反
失真”的正交分頻多工系統之系統原型，不僅包括射頻電路，也包括一些具主宰地位的基頻
部分。亦試圖利用系統參數來加速線性化電路調適上的收斂速度，為未來基頻發射器與線
性化電路的可能合併設計鋪路。

一、研究目的 
Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) has been adopted in several wireless 
standards such as digital audio or video broadcasting and IEEE 802.11a wireless LAN. The major 
advantages of OFDM are efficiently bandwidth efficiency, robustness to multi-path fading and 
channel equalization. One of its major drawbacks is the large peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) 
[1] which demands a linear power amplifier (PA) over a large dynamic signal range. However, a 
stand-alone linear PA, like class-A PA, suffers the problem of low power efficiency. On the other 
hand, a stand-alone power-efficient PA, like class-AB or class-B PA, is usually highly nonlinear. 
When a large dynamic modulated signal goes through a nonlinear PA and clips by the PA's 
saturation level, inter-modulation distortion (IMD) emerges, which not only distorts the 
modulated signal but also causes the power spectrum of the modulated signal to overflow to the 
adjacent channels. As a result, both self-interference and mutual-interference among neighboring 
channels seriously degrade the communication quality. The overall IMD caused by a nonlinear 
PA can be categorized into clipping distortion and compressive gain distortion. In particular, a 
digital adaptive predistortion (DAPD) scheme [2]-[4] is a common practice to work with a 
high-power-efficient-but-nonlinear PA to suppress the overall IMD effect. However, the 
maximum correctable signal range of a DAPD scheme is limited by PA's saturation level. Without 
sufficient power back-off, the dynamic modulated signal will still undergo clipping distortion 
although the nonlinear effect of compressive gain distortion is compensated by a DAPD scheme. 
To maintain power efficiency and to suppress overall IMD, a PAPR reduction scheme and a 
predistortion scheme should be jointly designed and cooperated together. 
 
Based on signal distortion or distortionless of PAPR reduction schemes, existing PAPR reduction 
schemes can be roughly divided into two groups: One group of PAPR reduction schemes are to 
intend to reduce the occurrence of large signal before inverse fast Fourier transformation (IFFT) 
output of OFDM signal. The other groups are to process directly the OFDM signal, which limit 
the peak signal power level or go through a nonlinear function. For the former, some reduction 
techniques such as selective mapping (SLM) [5-6], partial transmit sequences (PTS) [7-8], 
[19-20] tone reservation [9], coding [10] are reported in the literature [11]. The fact is that each 
OFDM symbol is scrambled by a certain number of scrambling sequences, which transmit each 
OFDM symbol with the smallest PAPR value. Either redundant or computational complexity is 
then relatively high and extremely dependence on number of subcarriers of IFFT and the 
modulated OFDM signal. Basically, the operations are independent of the PA characteristics thus 
lacking a targeted PA's saturation level. However, clipping distortion is a major concern, so we 
focus mainly on the latter, some outstanding reduction schemes of which include digital 
clipping-and-filtering (DCF) schemes [12-13], and companding transform (CT) schemes [14-15], 
[21-22]. Generally speaking, the DCF scheme is clipped by a artificially desired peak power 
level and filtered out-of-band spectrum radiation, the CT scheme compresses the large signal 
with a memory-less transformation in transmitter and expands the signal with the inverse 
transform function in receiver. All of PAPR reduction schemes are restricted to PA's saturation

二、研究方法 
In this section, we describe the math model of a jointly PAPR reduction and a DAPD scheme. 
Shown in Fig. 1 is a OFDM transmitter with a CT function and a digitally-predistorted PA. The 
complex lth subcarrier in the mth baseband OFDM modulated symbol can be expressed by

where N1 is the number of subcarrier, 1{0,1, , 1}l N∈ −" , SJ,m is data symbol modulated by 
means of the N1-point IFFT on the lth subcarrier. Each OFDM symbol is fed to the cascade of a 
CT function and a digitally-predistorted PA link. The former transforms the OFDM modulated 
signal sj,m to produce the newly modulated signal

where Kc is a constant to keep the input and output signal of CT function at the same average 
power level, scl,m denotes output signal of CT function, p(t) is the Nyquist pulse-shaping filter, Ts 
is the sampling period. The latter distorts the modulated input signal vm to produce the 
predistorted signal and takes over the predistorted signal, digital-to-analog (D/A) transforms it, 
frequency up-converts it, and then power amplifies it to generate the transmit signal va. 
 
Note that it has been known that the PAPR of OFDM signal can be reduced by CT function [15]. 
The CT function is a typical process of nonlinear function that may leads the signal distortion in 
transmitter side and noise enhancement in receiver side. Therefore, we add the noise level block 
to simulate the performance loss in receiver side to minimize overall distortion. We further 
consider the CT function in [15], the output signal of CT function is obtained by
