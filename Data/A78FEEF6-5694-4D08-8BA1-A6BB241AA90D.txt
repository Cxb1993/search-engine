1ABSTRACT
Bioactive packaging composed of immobilized enzyme
as bio-recognition element have been used to interact with
specific chemicals, and detect undesirable changes related
to quality and safety in packages. The present study aimed
to develop a biosensor based on bienzyme system (alcohol
oxidase–peroxidase) and coloring agent
(2,6-dichloroindophenol, DCIP) incorporated on polymer
film to non-destructively detect ethanol in package. LDPE
film, underwent surface modification using UV/O3/TiO2,
was coated with polyvinyl alcohol/polyvinyl pyrrolidone
(PVA/PVP) copolymer which is used to bind cellulose for
the biosensor basis. The enzyme mixture was then
immobilized on the copolymer matrix to form a biosensor.
Polar group of–C=O on LDPE was confirmed at 1714.41
cm-1 by FTIR after 6 hr surface modification, and
significant decrease in contact angles was also observed,
what indicated the effectiveness of surface modification
and the increase of affinity on LDPE surface. The optimal
PVA/PVP ratio for coating on LDPE was found using PVA
/ PVP at 4:6 (w/w) determined by ATR-FTIR, and this
bipolymer incorporated with 25% cellulose was effective to
reveal color change from the immobilized biosensing
components. The formula of enzyme reagents containing
alcohol oxidase: peroxidase: DCIP = 1: 1: 1 led to a
significant color development (ΔE) with respect to a 50ppm
ethanol vapor after 6 hr at 4oC. Use of 1mM potassium
ferrocyanide in enzyme mixture resulted to greater ΔE 
values after 72 hr, and color development reached
saturation in 36 hr when exposed to 200 ppm ethanol. The
present active packaging is therefore beneficial to
non-destructive determination of packaged food quality.

INTRODUCTION
Active packaging technologies focus on gas scavenging
and emitting to maintain product quality and/or safety
during storage (Ozdemir and Floros 2004; Brody and others,
2008; Vermeiren and others 2002). Biosensor is one of
active packaging applications based on a specific biological
recognition element in combination with a signal
transducer or color change, this is also an attractive
alternative to chromatographic analyses (Alocilja and
Radke 2003; Patel 2002).
Ready-to-eat fruits and vegetables show an increasingly
growing market for industry and consumers demand.
However, improper packaging or temperature abuse may
lead packaged products expose to injurious low O2 partial
pressures (Cameron and others 1995). Previous studies
showed that at very low O2 partial pressures, fruit and
vegetable products produce fermentative volatiles such as
ethanol, ethyl acetate, acetaldehyde and methyl esters
which significantly decrease the product quality (Pentima
and others 1995; Song and others 1997). Cameron and
others (1995) demonstrated formation of ethanol related to
low O2 injury in package, therefore, a simple and reliable
technique for the detection of low O2 injury in package
would reduce the risk of unsafe or undesirable compounds
produced (Pesis 2005).
Polyolefin materials, such as PE, PP, are inert and
therefore require surface functionalization prior to
incorporating bioactive compounds on surface (Bai and
others 1996). Bioactive packaging employing bioactive
compounds, such as enzyme immobilized via entrapment or
physical adsorption into food package, to interact with the
undesirable chemicals occurred during transportation and
storage is useful to indicate the product quality (Carrascosa
2006; Goddard and others 2007; Kothapalli and others
2007; Lei and others 2004; Steven and Hotchkiss 2003).
Therefore, fabrication of a non-migratory bioactive
packaging is important for a regulatory standpoint.
The objectives of this study focused on the
development of a bioactive packaging system constructed
by bi-enzyme system and coloring agent incorporated on
packaging film to non-destructively detect undesirable
ethanol in food package. The immobilization of biosensing
elements on LDPE film was achieved using UV/O3/TiO2
surface modification to increase the affinity of polyolefin
material.

32. Sensitivity
To evaluate the sensitivity of biosensor exposed to
ethanol atmosphere, ΔE and color development were
accomplished. Biosensing elements were composed of
formulated by alcohol oxidase, peroxidase and DCIP, and
effect of formulation was determined corresponding to
color change. Optimal ΔE and color development were
found with formula of alcohol oxidase: peroxidase: DCIP =
1:1:1 added with 1 mM potassium ferrocyanide (Fig. 5 and
6), thus, subsequent analyses were based on this
composition.
Effect of cellulose content on the biosensor background
was also studied, where 10–25% (w/w) cellulose contents
were used in the copolymer. Biosensors containing 10 or
15% showed transparent nature (Table 1),
Additionally, greater ΔE on biosensor exposed to 50
ppm ethanol at 4oC were found with 20 or 25% cellulose
compared to 10-15% (Fig. 7). Therefore, 20 and 25%
cellulose were selected for the biosensor label.

3. Reliability
Detecting capability to ethanol vapor (50–200 ppm) were
evaluated stored at 4oC for 72 hr.ΔE values were found in
association with ethanol vapor content and storage duration,
rate ofΔE saturation was found reversely proportional to
ethanol content in headspace (Fig. 8, Table 2). Greater
color development was found from biosensor composed
25% cellulose, and saturation was reached in 36 hr when
exposed to 200 ppm ethanol (Fig. 9).
