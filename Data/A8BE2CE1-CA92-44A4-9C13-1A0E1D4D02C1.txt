1. Abstract 
This research is the third-year project of a 
three-year research structure. Considering the 
two-stage flexible flow shop with dynamic job 
arrival, the job completion time at each stage is 
useful to enhance the customer service or 
production performances. Therefore, a 
probabilistic model is developed to estimate the 
stage completion time of jobs for the two-stage 
flexible flow shop, in which the inter-arrival 
time of jobs for different product types is 
assumed to be independently and exponentially 
distributed and the jobs are dispatched to 
parallel machines by FIFO rule. A 
sequence-dependent setup occurs for the process 
changing from one product type to another.

2. Motives and goals 
The flexible flow shop with jobs arriving 
dynamically is a complicated scheduling 
problem, which has many real-world 
applications. In general, the flexible flow shop 
consists of a set of more than two process stages, 
in which each stage is made up of identical 
parallel machines, and the next stage will 
receive jobs with stochastic arriving time from 
the previous stage. Jobs arrive at the system 
dynamically, which makes the arriving time of 
jobs at each stage and the completion time of 
jobs at each stage difficult to predict. Note that 
the final stage completion time can be applied to 
assign an internal due date for a job to respond 
the delivery date request from customer and to 
facilitate the shop floor control. Therefore, it is 
important to develop an efficient approach to 
estimate the job finished time at each stage to 
enhance the customer service and the production

3.2. The estimated arrival rates of jobs at the 
second stage  
In order to calculate the completion time of 
jobs at the second stage, the arrival rates of jobs 
at the second have to define in advance. The 
arrival rate of the product type j at the second 
stage is equal to the inverse of the mean of the 
inter-arrival time for the product type j and can 
be shown as (6).

3.3. The estimated utilization rates of 
machines  
The estimated completion time of jobs at 
the second stage relates to the utilization rates of 
machines, which should be corrected due to the 
idleness of machine. The idle time depends on 
the number of jobs in the system at specific time, 
in which the idle time can be described by the 
birth-and-death process. Therefore, the total idle 
time can be calculated as (8).

3.4. The estimated completion time of jobs at 
the second stage  
In the similar composition defined in (1), 
the estimated completion time of the ith job of 
product type j at the second stage is equal to the 
sum of the arrival time of the ith job of type j at 
the second stage, the average waiting time for 
jobs in queue at the second stage, and the 
average service time for jobs of the product type 
j at the second stage, which can be shown as 
(10).

the expected arrival time, the expected waiting 
time in queue, and the expected average service 
time for jobs of the ith job of type j at the second 
stage respectively, and can be calculated in the 
same way of the first stage. 
4. Case study 
To evaluate the performance of the 
proposed probabilistic model in this project, one 
simulation model is built, in which jobs are 
dispatched to machines according to the FIFO 
rule. In the simulation model, there are two 
process stages and each stage is made up of two 
parallel machines, and the inter-arrival time of 
jobs is independently and exponentially 
distributed. Then the estimated arrival rate for 
each product type job at each stage and the 
estimated lead time for each product type job at 
each stage are calculated by the probabilistic 
model under the FIFO rule, which are used to be 
compared with the arrival rate for each product 
type job at each stage and the lead time for each 
product type job at each stage determined by the 
simulation model under the FIFO rule. 
Therefore, the accuracy of the proposed 
probabilistic model can be evaluated.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The flexible flow shop with jobs arriving dynamically is a complicated scheduling problem, 
which has many real-world applications, especially in the TFT-LCD manufacturing or in the 
integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing industry. In general, the flexible flow shop consists of a set of 
more than two process stages, in which each stage is made up of identical parallel machines, and the 
next stage will receive jobs with stochastic arriving time from the previous stage. Jobs arrive at the 
system dynamically, which makes the arriving time of jobs at each stage and the completion time of 
jobs at each stage difficult to predict. Note that the final stage completion time can be applied to 
assign an internal due date for a job to respond the delivery date request from customer and to 
facilitate the shop floor control. Therefore, it is important to develop an efficient approach to estimate 
the job finished time at each stage to enhance the customer service and production performance.  
In this paper, a probabilistic model is developed to estimate the stage completion time of jobs for 
the two-stage flexible flow shop, in which the inter-arrival time of jobs for different product types is 
assumed to be independently and exponentially distributed and the jobs are dispatched to parallel 
machines by FIFO rule. A sequence-dependent setup occurs for the process changing from one 
product type to another. The completion time of jobs at each stage can be determined with the 
summation of the stage arriving time of jobs, the expected stage waiting time of jobs, and the 
expected stage service time of jobs. The expected stage waiting time of job relates to the utilization 
rates of machines, which should be corrected due to the idleness of machine. The idle time depends 
on the number of jobs in the system at specific time. The birth-and-death process can be used to 
describe probabilistically how the number of jobs in the system changes as time increasing. The stage 
service time of jobs is defined by adding the estimated setup time and the processing time of jobs at 
each stage. The completion time of jobs at each stage relates to the arrival rates of jobs at each stage, 
therefore, the arrival rates of jobs at each stage must compute in advance. The arrival rates of jobs at

2. THE PROBABILISTIC MODEL FOR THE STAGE COMPLETION TIME 
In this section, a probabilistic model for the stage completion time of jobs is developed for the 
two-stage flexible flow shop with jobs of different product types arriving dynamically, in which the 
inter-arrival time of jobs is exponentially distributed and the FIFO rule is applied to dispatch jobs. A 
sequence-dependent setup occurs with process changing from one product type to another. The 
general models of jobs for the second stage estimated completion time are developed by firstly 
defining the estimated completion time of jobs at the first stage and then secondly defining the 
estimated arrival rates.  
2.1 The estimated completion time of jobs at the first stage 
Let J be the number of product types and k1 be the number of machines at the first stage. Let 
N1,j(t) be the number of arriving jobs of product type j by time t at the first stage, in which 
( )1,{ , 0}jN t t ≥  assumes a Poisson process with arrival rate 1, jλ , 1, 2, ,j J= … . The total arrival rate 
at the first stage 1λ  is equal to the sum of 1, jλ for all product types, 1 1,Jj jλ=∑ . 
The flexible flow shop is made up of identical parallel machines at each stage. Since the jobs are 
dispatched to one of parallel machines at each stage, the expected completion time of the ith job of 
type j at the first stage (E(C1,ij)) can be estimated with the sum of the expected arrival time of the ith 
job of type j at the first stage (E(Y1,[i]j)), the expected waiting time in queue for the ith job of type j at 
the first stage (E(W1,ij)), and the expected average service time for jobs of the product type j at the first 
stage (E(ST1,ij)). Therefore, E(C1,ij) can be expressed as Equation (1) and the calculations of E(Y1,[i]j), 
E(W1,ij) and E(ST1,ij) are presented below.

Since the inter-arrival time of job for the product type j at the first stage is independently and 
exponentially distributed with the parameter 1, jλ , 1, 2, ,j J= … , the arrival time of the product type j 
job in a horizon at the first stage should be uniformly distributed over [L1, U1]. Let Y1,[i]j be the arrival

In Equation (5), E(ST1,ij) depends on the probability P1,FIFO. Therefore, before calculating the 
expected service time of the ith job of type j at the first stage (E(ST1,ij)), it is necessary to calculate the 
probability P1,FIFO  in advance. For further details about the mathematical proof in the probability 
P1,FIFO, see Yang et al. (2006).

2.3 The estimated utilization rates of machines at the second stage 
The estimated completion time of jobs at second stage can be determined with the sum of the 
expected arriving time, the expected waiting time, and the expected service time of jobs at the second 
stage. The expected waiting time of job relates to the utilization rates of machines, which should be 
corrected due to the idleness of machine. The idle time depends on the number of jobs in the system at 
specific time, in which the idle time can be described by the birth-and-death process. Suppose that the 
number of jobs present in the system at the second stage are smaller than the number of machines, the 
idle time can be estimated with the time until the next jobs arrived or the time until jobs completed 
their processing. The time until the next jobs arrived is the inter-arrival of jobs at the second stage, 
which is the exponential distribution with the parameter 2λ . The time until jobs completed their 
processing is the service time of jobs.

of type j in queue at the second stage, and E(ST2,ij) is the expected service time for jobs of the product 
type j at the second stage. 
Suppose that the moving time of jobs between the first stage and the second is equal to zero. 
Therefore, the expected arrival time of the ith job of type j at the second stage (E(Y2,[i]j)) is equal to the 
expected value of the completion time of the ith job of type j at the first stage (E(C1,ij)). Thus, the 
estimated completion time of the ith jobs of the product type j at the second stage can be reformulated 
as Equation (16).

The calculations of E(W2,ij) and E(ST2,ij) are presented below. At the second stage, jobs with 
different product types arrive dynamically in the horizon [L2, U2]. Therefore, L2 can be defined as the 
expected value of the minimum completion time of jobs at the first stage, and U2 can be defined as the 
expected value of the maximum completion time of jobs at the first stage. L2 and U2 are expressed in

inter-arrival time of job for the product type j at the first stage is independently and exponentially

Furthermore, the job arrival rate for each product type at the first stage and the job processing 
time for each product type at each stage are calculated. First, the arrival rate of the product type j job 
at the first stage ( 1, jλ ) can be derived as 8 11, 1, 1, 1( / )jj j ju uλ λ=∑= , where u1,j is the random number (beta 
distribution with parameters 0.65α =  and 0.35β = ) at the first stage for 1,2, ,8j = … . Second, the

where the expected service time of jobs at the tth stage is given by ( ) ( ) /t t t tE ST kρ λ=  and 1,2t = . In 
order to solve the processing time for each product type by Equation (18), we assume that the ratio of 
processing time for two specific product types is set to be fixed constant. Note that “second” is the 
units of processing time and setup time. 
Accuracy analysis of the probabilistic model for the job arrival rate 
 17
nonbottleneck to the bottleneck, the error percentage of estimated job arrival rate is decreasing, which 
is the results of the slight influence on the waiting time of jobs at the nonbottleneck. 
The higher error percentage of estimated job arrival rate occurring for the combination of 
1 0.90ρ =  and 2 0.70ρ = relates to the smaller time horizon at the first stage. The lower error 
percentage of estimated job arrival rate occurring for the combination of 1 0.70ρ = , and 2 0.90ρ =  
relates to the longer time horizon at the first stage. The overall mean of the error percentages of 
estimated job arrival rate is 4.9519 %. In general, the probabilistic model can estimate the job arrival 
rate accurately.  
Accuracy analysis of the probabilistic model for the lead time of the product type 
The accuracy on the estimated stage completion time of jobs is evaluated in this paper. However, 
the number of jobs generated by the probabilistic model and the simulation model are not the same. 
Therefore, the lead time for each product type is adopted instead to evaluate the accuracy on the 
estimated stage completion time of jobs, in which lead time of job is the period of time between the 
arriving of job at one stage and the completion of job at that stage.  
Table 2 displays the lead time at the first stage generated by the probabilistic model and the 
simulation for various expected stage machine utilization rates, total arrival rates at the first stage, and 
time horizons at the first stage. Table 3 displays the lead time at the second stage generated by the 
probabilistic model and the simulation for various expected stage machine utilization rates, total 
arrival rates at the first stage, and time horizons at the first stage. To analyze the accuracy of the 
probabilistic model on estimating the lead time of the product type, the error percentage of estimated 
the lead time is defined by Equation (21). The mean error percentage for the service time is 9.2586% 
at the first stage and at the second stage 6.8007%, which indicate that the proposed model can 
estimate the stage service time accurately.  However, for the waiting time estimation, the proposed 
model can not restrict the estimation error in an accepted range, which leads to the estimation error of 
job lead time.  Note that error percentage of estimated waiting time increasing at the second stage, 
which requires future works to improve the probabilistic model on lead time estimation.

Table 4 presents the results of the goodness of fit and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for some 
simulation runs, in which the null hypothesis that the inter-arrival time of jobs is generated by the 
simulation at the first stage and the second stage from a population that follows the exponential 
distribution. Table 4 reveals that the P-value at the first stage is more than the 0.05 level of 
significance, and then we can conclude at the 0.05 level of significance that the inter-arrival time of 
jobs by the simulation at the first stage from a population that follows the exponential distribution. 
However, some P-value at the second stage are less than the 0.05 level of significance, and then he 
inter-arrival time of jobs by the simulation at the second stage did not come from a population that 
follows the exponential distribution.

何謂服務？
A service is a provider/client interaction that 
creates and captures value.
A typical doctor/patient interaction, 
Both sides benefit from the transaction - referred 
to as "capturing value" in services parlance. 
The doctor receives a fee; the patient gets a 
health assessment and (it is hoped) recovers 
from the illness. 
This basic principle also underlies the work 
between a services provider and a corporation

Example: IBM’s service
The provider must monitor and assess the way the 
client is performing its responsibilities. 
If the client does not install the new IT systems and train 
the necessary people in the reengineered process, the 
client firm will not receive the benefit of the service. 
The client needs to determine that the provider is 
likewise applying satisfactory effort and quality 
controls in the performance of its tasks. 
These issues become very important in outsourcing 
A client may outsource a component of its business to a  
global provider (In a different country with different 
government regulations and national cultures)

The gap to the client's or 
provider's expectations
A significant percentage of service do not 
meet the client's or provider's expectations, 
estimates range from 10-50 percent
resulting in poor performance and low 
satisfaction
This gap is an opportunity for services 
innovation to improve returns, performance 
and satisfaction.

Implications of SSME
Employment growth trends
As global markets become increasingly service-
based economies, employment growth will be 
concentrated in the service-providing sectors of 
the global economy, and service innovation will 
be needed to maintain profits. 
Service design, development, marketing and 
delivery all require methods to make service 
businesses more efficient and scalable. 
Practitioners need depth and breadth in 
combinations of technology, business, and 
organizational studies, even at the 
undergraduate level.

Innovation aimed at improving
sociotechnical business systems
Clients rarely buy an IT system 
simply because of its technical capabilities (faster, 
more capacity, etc.) 
but instead require a business model 
(return on investment) 
and an organizational change model 
(reengineered processes and job roles) 
that will make the technology an effective 
solution to their business problems.
