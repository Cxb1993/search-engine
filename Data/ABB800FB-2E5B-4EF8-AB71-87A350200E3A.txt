Stochastic model predicting particle deposition velocity in turbulent flow field 
前言 
Based on the surface rejuvenation model the local cumulative submicron particle deposition from a turbulent flow 
onto a tube wall has been theoretically predicted including the conjoint effects of eddy diffusion, Brownian diffusion, and 
thermophoresis. The quantitative predictions of mean particle deposition velocity coupled with appropriate estimates of the 
mean eddy approach distance are evaluated by comparison with previous models and experimental measurements. The 
results are consistent with visual observations and the simple approximate solutions have been obtained for predicting the 
viscous sublayer, thermophoretic effect and transport rate in detail. A clear coupling on the particle transfer mechanisms 
near the wall provides a good agreement of mean transport rate in an isothermal turbulence fluid flow as compared with 
previous models which proves the subsequent development of the interactions between thermal and turbulent mechanism 
on the particle transport processes. 
研究目的 
In many industries the composition of processing gases may contain any of an unlimited range of 
particulate, liquid, or gaseous contaminants and may be influenced by uncontrolled factors of 
temperature and humidity. When such an impure gas is bounded by a solid surface, a boundary layer 
will develop and the energy and momentum transfer gives rise to temperature and velocity gradients. 
Mass transfer caused by gravitation, molecular diffusion, eddy diffusion, and inertial impact results in 
deposition of the suspended components onto the surface. A number of engineering fields involve 
droplet and particle deposition, and may exploit or suppress the deposition depending on the practical 
requirement. For example, the application of pigments, ceramic powders to surfaces, chemical coating 
of metals, and filtration all seek more efficient ways of increasing deposition, whereas the deposition 
of aerosol particles appears as an unwanted phenomenon in the contamination of semiconductor 
elements during manufacture, soiling of artistic products and indoor surfaces, fouling and corrosion of 
heat exchangers, boiler tubes, turbine equipment, etc.  
文獻探討 
In most engineering situations particle transport occurs in the presence of turbulent flow. The 
addition of particulate matter to turbulent flows increases the complexity of the phenomena. It suggests 
that any models should represent the behavior of flow in the wall region as accurately as possible. The 
particle tracking methods are Lagranging approach, which treats trajectories of individual particles, 
and Eulerian approach which views the aerosol particle system as a continuum phase and treats them 
as a species concentration field. The viscous sublayer models relied on the surface renewal, penetration 
and surface rejuvenation concepts indicate that the processes in the region near the wall mainly 
determine the momentum, heat and mass transfer. The fluid motion led to an acceleration of the low 
momentum fluid near the wall, and it has been suggested that the low momentum fluid near the wall 
leads to a laminar boundary being developed and which eventually becomes unstable, leading to a 
sudden ejection of fluid away from the wall. The concept of the surface renewal and penetration 
assumes that fluid elements at the wall are randomly replaced by eddies approaching the wall from the 
turbulent core into direct contact with the surface [1], [2]. Corino and Brodkey [3] experimentally 
studied the flow close to the wall in turbulent flow and clearly demonstrated that the flow in the wall 
region is unsteady and that eddies were continuously observed to penetrate deep into the wall region. 
The experimental results of Rashid et al. [4] indicated that the particles in turbulent flows are 
transported by the bursting events of the wall regions and the values of turbulent intensities and 
Reynolds stresses depend on the number of wall ejections, which increase at lager particles 
)1100( md p μ=  and decrease at smaller particles )120( md p μ= . Nijsing [5] and Pinczewski and 
Sideman [6] suggested that a boundary layer development at the wall is similar to that above a flat 
plate. These models similar to the surface renew concept that eddies reach completely up to the wall 
and indicate an undisturbed layer at the wall which contradict the observation from the experimental 
studies. Harriott [7] has developed the surface rejuvenation model to modify the basic surface renew 
model to account for the effect of eddies not penetrating down to the wall surface itself. This concept 
has been coupled with a stochastic computational concept by Bullin and Dukler [8] to determine the 
mean mass transfer coefficient in terms of unspecified parameters of eddy lifetime and approach

 thermophoretic velocity is analyzed in detail and the physical trends of the comparable effects of 
turbophoresis and thermophoresis on particle transport process are quantitatively revealed in some 
extent. It is helpful to explain some of limited fouling data, which have been reported, and to 
understand the complex phenomena of the interaction between suspended particulate matter and the 
turbulence of the carrier fluid in nonisothermal boundary layers. 
研究方法 
When the thermophoresis term is introduced, the boundary layer equation of concentration 
becomes more complicated since the effect of thermophoresis is greater when yT ∂∂  is greater. The 
model is based on the detailed analyses of interactions between thermal and turbulent mechanism in 
the viscous sublayer caused by radial turbulence fluctuation. The particles are moving under fully 
developed turbulent flow conditions, and the thin layer close to the wall is assumed to be generated 
randomly by the inrushing fluid which has average values of velocity, ∞u , temperature, ∞T , and 
concentration, ∞C . The mechanisms of bulk fluid convection, eddy diffusion, molecular diffusion and 
temperature gradient are assumed to dominate the particle transfer onto an isothermal stagnation 
surface which is immersed in the fluid of constant velocity and temperature. In general much of the 
modeling has been related to small Sc  or Pr  numbers, where the diffusion layer may be 
considerably greater than the expected displacement thickness of the developing wall layer. As the 
Schmidt number becomes greater the transverse phenomena become much less important in evaluating 
the averaged mass transfers within a typical downsweep-upsweep cycle and the transfer processes 
occur as a one dimensional transient process while the eddy is close to the wall. The investigation 
focuses on diffusive deposition of the dilute submicron particles. Thus, the sedimentation of particles 
is not included in the analysis since the contribution of sedimentation on submicron particle deposition 
is very small and can be neglected as compared with eddy and Brownian diffusion. However, the effect 
of sedimentation increases with increasing particle size and with decreasing shear velocity. The effects 
of electrical charge are also excluded by assuming that particles are uncharged. The eddies influencing 
the transport rate do not come all the way to the surface and are assumed to reach a distance from the 
surface. The effect of dilute particle distribution on the nonisothermal fluid flow can be neglected so 
that the concentration equation is decoupled from the momentum and energy equations where the fluid 
temperature and velocity distributions are calculated independently due to the temperature 
development caused by the radial fluctuation velocities is analogous to the oscillating sublayer 
development. Neglecting the viscous dissipation and pressure gradient, the radial fluctuation fractions 
of turbulent fluid intermittently move from the core to approach the distances from the wall. Unsteady 
momentum, heat and mass transfers are assumed to govern the area within the wall region for the 
period of time between two successive eddies by which the unsteady distributions of an individual 
element of fluid with constant properties may be described by

Fig. 15 shows the comparison of the mean particle transport coefficient with previously proposed 
models of Harriott [7], and Bullin and Dukler [8]. They modified the Danckwert’s model by assuming 
that the eddies come to near the wall at the random sequences of eddy lifetimes and approach distances 
based on a probability rule of gamma density, the results of their analysis for the mean transport 
coefficient in terms of unspecified modeling parameters τ  and H  are based on varying a single 
parameter α  of gamma density to obtain different statistical distributions. In Harriott’s results, the 
mean transport coefficient is changed dramatically at high value of ω  with the varying distribution 
form of the eddy approach distance ( )1,2,∞=Hα  while the renewal time was held constant ( ∞=τα ). 
The same conclusion appears in Bullin’s results for variable τα  while the eddy approach distance was 
held on to a fixed distribution form 0=Hα . The present result is seen to be in good agreement except 
∞=Hα  corresponding to the constant approach distance which is expected to be applied at low 
τω DH=  as the penetration theory. In Fig. 16, the mean concentration distribution relative to 
characteristic parameter ω  at constant values of 5.0=υ  and 000,50Re =  is made for validating 
the mean transport coefficient shown in Fig.15. The eddies occasionally penetrate from turbulent core 
to within random distance from the interface and act to increase the mean transport coefficient. The 
penetrating depth of eddies gets larger at high values of ω  where the mean concentration boundary 
layer sharply develops giving rise to a large concentration gradient at the mean approach distance H  
and an increase in the total transport rate. The viscous sublayer retards the concentration development 
at low values of ω  and maintains the mean concentration )()( ∞∞ −− CCCC w  at the mean approach 
distance almost at 0.1 , which will cause an decrease in the total transport rate    since the aerosol 
particles do not have time to diffuse between eddies, only the disturbances very near the wall 
contribute much to the transfer process. 
Fig. 17 describes that the growth rate of concentration boundary layer established inside the 
isothermal viscous sublayer depends on the turbulent intensity. Certainly, the thickness of 
concentration boundary layer decreases with an increase in Reynolds number and more disturbances 
 of ϑ  at CTT ow 50=− ∞  and Co50− , respectively. The calculated values of )()( ∞∞ −− CCCC w  at 
001.0=Υ  relative to ϖ  depicted in Fig. 23 and 24 are made to examine the acquired trend further. 
At the heating surface, the increases of concentration gradient extend to some extent along with ϖ  
giving rise to an increase in the mean thermophoretic transport coefficient DHVd  and both of them 
relatively reach their peak just as the upturned tendency comes into existence in Fig. 20. Therefore, the 
appearance of upturned tendency begins at the different values of ϖ  depending on the specified value 
of ϑ  as the peak values shown in Figs. 21 and 23 where they are decreased with increasing ϑ  which 
means that the turbophoresis takes command of total transport rate at low values of ϖ  and then 
balances by the thermophoresis leading to a decrease in the total transport rate at high values of ϖ , 
since only the disturbances very near the wall contribute much to the transfer process at the heating 
surface. At cold surface CTT ow 50−=− ∞ , the particles come near the surface with the turbophoresis 
during the random sequences of eddy lifetimes and then the thermophoresis enhances the particles to 
diffuse through the viscous sublayer giving rise to a strict increase in the mean thermophoretic 
transport coefficient DHVd  with increasing ϖ  and ϑ  as well. This result can also be felt out by 
following the thread of the calculated values of )()( ∞∞ −

 at 001.0=Υ  where the concentration 
gradient increases not only with increasing ϖ  but ϑ , which means that the depth of penetration of 
the concentration boundary layer is strongly dependent on both of them.

Subsequently, Figs. 25 and 26 indicate the comparable effects of turbophoresis and molecular 
diffusion under a constant thermophoretic effect at CTT ow 50=− ∞  and Co50− , respectively. In 
turbulent flow the eddies will occasionally penetrate near the concentration boundary layer and act to 
increase the average transfer rate. In an isothermal turbulence flow field, the relative velocity between 
the particles and fluid tends to increase as particle diameter increases and the interaction of larger 
particles with the wall structures is greater near the wall, thus giving rise to the enhancement of the 
wall viscosity, whereas the smaller particles cause a suppression of this intensity. In Fig. 25 the thermal 
energy is transported from the heating surface to the bulk flow, the thermophoretic effect responses to 
the velocity gradient are seen to be low at low ϖ , thus resulting in the reduction on the 
thermophoretic behavior of the particle to deviate from its behavior when it is in the isothermal 
condition. Whereas the thermophoretic effect responses to the velocity gradient are seen to be increase 
as the values of ϖ  increase giving rise to an suppression on the total transport rate which reaches an 
equilibrium at higher value of ϖ . A pronounced increase in the transport rate appears at the cooling 
surface as compared with the isothermal condition 0=thV  as shown in Fig. 26 wherein an 
enhancement on the molecular diffusion caused by turbophoresis and thermophoresis is found to play 
an important role in the particle transport process throughout the particle diameters considered and the 
slope of the transport rate decays with decreasing molecular diffusion which is in contrast to the case 
of the heating surface where the thermophoretic effect on the total transport rate is most important for 
low diffusivities and appears not so conspicuous for the smaller particles conducing to the steeper 
slope of the transport rate on the larger particles. Based on the above results, the slope of decay of the
