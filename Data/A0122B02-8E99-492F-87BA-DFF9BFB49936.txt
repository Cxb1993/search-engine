400°C. As for the processes employing a high 
treatment temperature, high nitrogen 
concentration is not easily formed in the 
near-surface region on account of rapid thermal 
diffusion. This is particularly true for 
low-voltage PIII [10]. This problem has been 
overcome by using high-voltage PIII at a lower 
temperature [11, 12].  
In the study of Miola et al.[13], X-ray 
diffraction analysis has been applied to plasma 
nitride AISI H-12 tool steel and obtained 
follow results: (i) The near-surface compound 
layer consists of a mixture of -Fe4N and 
-Fex(N,C); (ii) Below this compound layer 
there is the so-called diffusion zone where the 
steel matrix is supersaturated by the 
in-diffusion nitrogen. The near-diffusion zone 
compound layer consists of a mixture of 
-Fe4N, -Fex(N,C) and -ausenite. Alphonsa 
et al.[14] indicated the presence of a 
predominantly Fe3N phase with dispersed CrN 
within 2-5 m on the surface. A minor phase 
of Fe4N was measured also. 
In the study of Aw et al.[15], plasma 
nitriding was used to form a hard layer 
containing chromium nitride on Inconel 718 
steel surface. The wear mechanism and the 
formation of laminar plate-like debris after 
sliding contact were investigated. Negative 
wear was observed because wear particles were 
trapped and accumulated in the contact 
interface. In the study of Lin et al. [16], PIII 
technology was applied to enhance the 
mechanical properties of P20, 718 and 420 
steels using plasma nitriding. The experimental 
results indicated that the hardness distributions 
at different penetration depths are directly 
related to the nitrogen concentration 
distributions. The average scratch depth of a 
specimen is lowered by increasing the 
penetration depth. 
The effect of the pulse bias voltage and 
nitrogen pressure on nitrogen distribution in 
steel substrate by the PIII technology was 
discussed in the study of Mitsuo et al. [17]. 
Nitrogen-affected region became deeper with 
bias voltage and nitrogen pressure. A diffusion 
mechanism involving the trapping and release 
of nitrogen at chromium sites was studied by 
Möller et al. [18, 19]. The Cr-trapping model 
was thus established. In reality, the 
implantation depth and nitrogen concentration 
distribution along this depth are governed by 
both the implantation and diffusion 
mechanisms. 
In the present study, three steel materials, 
DC11, DC53 and SKH51, with several 
different trace elements to promote mechanical 
strengths and wear resistance of the specimen, 
were selected as the mold substrate materials 
used in the press formings. The plasma ion 
implantation (P) technique was applied to 
enhance the specimens'  mechanical properties, 
including mechanical hardness, Young’s 
modulus, fatigue life, fracture toughness and 
scratch wear resistance. The specimen 
hardnesses affected by the penetration depth of 
nitrogen and the peak position of nitrogen 
concentration are discussed. The total 
penetration depths of nitrogen due to N2:H2 
molecular ratio are investigated. The wear 
resistance of a specimen treated by the PIII 
technique is expressed in terms of the average 
scratch depth of a wear track formed either in 
the scratching process under a constant normal 
load or after finishing the elastic recovery. The 
effects of implantation conditions on the wear 
4 
 
microstructures. 
    A nanotester (Micro Materials, UK) was 
applied, with its maximum indentation load set 
on the indentation load-depth curve to be in a 
range of 0.1~50mN. The indentation depth was 
thus varied in a range from a depth of less than 
20% of the nitrogen penetration depth. The 
hardness results corresponding to this 
indentation depth can be approximated as the 
hardness of the penetration layer without the 
influence of the substrate material, but they are 
still slightly varied with the indentation depth. 
In the present study, a diamond Berkovich 
indenter which has a radius of curvature of the 
indenter tip ranging from 100nm to 150nm was 
used. The loading rate of 0.22mN/s was 
adopted in the indentation tests. The 
indentation tests were carried out at a room 
temperature of 25 C°  and a relative humidity 
of 50%.  
The contact area function developed by 
Oliver and Pharr [21] was applied to obtain the 
contact area in order to evaluate the material 
hardnesses by the nanoindentation test. The 
elastic modulus of the coating film can be 
obtained from the use of the expression 
developed by Oliver and Pharr [21] for the 
reduced modulus. 
  This nanotester can also be used to 
investigate the tribological behavior of a 
specimen through the scratch tests. In the 
present study, the Rockwell-type spherical 
indenter with a radius of 10 mµ  was applied to 
the scratch wear tests under a normal load of 
500 mN as well as at a scratch velocity of 
2 /m sµ . The scratch length of a test was 
150 mµ . Here, one cycle in the scratch test 
comprises the forward movement of the 
indenter to generate a scratch depth and the 
backward movement to measure the 
topography of the wear track after its elastic 
recovery. The scratch wear tests were 
conducted at an ambient temperature of 25 ˚C 
and a relative humidity of 50%. The indenter 
could be controlled to repeat many cycles at the 
same wear track. In the present study, the 
maximum cycle number was 10. 
The fatigue life of the nitrided layer can be 
obtained from the schematic diagram of the 
load conditions as shown in Fig.1. Fatigue tests 
were also carried out on the same nanotester 
( Micro Materials, UK ) with the following 
conditions: meanP = 150 mN; oscillating load 
amplitude, oP = 5 V ( this system showed the 
load amplitude in terms of the electric voltage, 
rather than the load). The load frequency, ω = 
100 Hz , and the dwelling time period in front 
of these load oscillations is 30 seconds. In this 
system, the loading rate in the loading process 
(starting the load from 0 to meanP ) cannot be set 
freely. A dwelling process of 30 seconds in 
front of the oscillating loads is set in order to 
avoid the lagging behavior exhibited in the 
loading process with a high loading rate to be 
extended to the oscillating–load processes. It 
should be mentioned that the indentation depth 
corresponding to this meanP  load in the 
dwelling process was found to be always much 
smaller than the total penetration depth. Since 
the maximum indentation depth corresponding 
to the sum of meanP  and oP  is still much 
smaller than the total penetration depth of 
nitrogen, the fatigue lives of these specimens 
6 
 
peak position of hardness is slightly different 
from the peak position of nitrogen 
concentration and it is believed that the 
hardness obtained by the present indentation 
tests is certainly the cumulative effect of these 
layers with their thickness smaller than the 
indentation depth. Nevertheless, the figure 
shows the characteristic that the hardness of a 
specimen is affected by the behavior exhibited 
in the nitrogen concentration distributions. 
 Figure 3 shows the experimental results of 
specimen hardness and Young’s modulus 
obtained from the nanoindentation tests of all 
the specimens, including the ones without ion 
implantation (marked as “pure” in this plot). 
They were obtained from the mean values of 
the mechanical hardnesses and Young’s moduli 
distributing over a penetration depth of 2000nm. 
This depth is always less than 20% of the total 
penetration depth of nitrogen. The specimen 
hardness corresponding to the specimen 
without nitrogen implantation is much lower 
than that of the specimen with nitrogen 
implantation. However, the Young’s modulus 
corresponding to the specimen without ion 
implantation is not necessarily lower than that 
of the specimen with nitrogen implantation. It 
can be noticed that the Young’s moduli of the 
DC11 and SKH51 specimens prepared by 
N2:H2=1:1 are elevated by increasing the 
implantation temperature. This feature can be 
attributable to their higher contents in ,Cr Mn , 
V, W, Mo , and Si  as compared with that of 
the DC53 specimen. The additions of these 
trace elements in these substrates can improve 
the mechanical strength of the specimen such 
as Young’s modulus operating at high 
temperatures. No significant differences in 
specimen hardness are shown among these 15 
specimens with different ion implantation 
conditions. These hardness data are varied in a 
range of 13.6 GPa to 10.6 GPa. 
 In the present study, the total penetration 
depth of nitrogen, the peak position of the 
nitrogen concentration, and the magnitude of 
the nitrogen concentration at the peak are three 
influential factors as to the mechanical 
properties of a specimen. Fig. 4(a) shows the 
mean hardnesses of three specimens, DC11, 
DC53 and SKH51, varying with the total 
penetration depth of nitrogen. Each curve in 
this plot was obtained from five kinds of 
specimens prepared by differing the N2:H2 ratio 
or the implantation temperature ( iT ). They are: 
(N2:H2=1:1, iT =400), (N2:H2=1:1, iT =460), 
(N2:H2=1:1, iT =520), (N2:H2=1:3, iT =400), 
and (N2:H2=4:1, iT =400). For the same 
substrate material, these five experimental data 
were fitted by a curve. The fitting curves of 
these three substrate materials, show the 
behavior that the hardness of the nitrided layer 
with a thickness of 2000nm is either lowered 
by or almost invariant with the increase in the 
total penetration depth of nitrogen. The 
penetration depth of nitrogen in the specimen is 
generally dependent upon the C and Cr  
contents of the substrate material. An excessive 
C content in the substrate is apt to lower the 
nitriding rate, and thus resulting in the 
reduction of the penetration depth. However, 
the role of Cr  in the substrate is helpful to 
increase the penetration depth. As Table 1 
shows, the highest C and Cr  contents are 
shown in the DC11 specimen; whereas the 
8 
 
In the SKH51 substrate, the total penetration 
depth is however slightly increased by raising 
the volume ratio of hydrogen in the gas 
mixture. 
 Tests were carried out to obtain their 
fracture toughness. In Fig.7, the specimens of 
code-1, code-2 and code-3 were prepared by 
differing the implantation temperature, whereas 
the specimens of code-4 and code-5 were 
prepared by differing the N2:H2 ratio. In the 
DC11 and SKH51 specimens, the fracture 
toughnesses are slightly elevated by increasing 
the implantation temperature. As to the DC53 
specimen, the fracture toughnesses are, 
however, almost invariant with the implantation 
temperature. Nevertheless, the differences in 
the fracture toughness due to the differences in 
the implantation temperature are rather small 
for all these three substrate materials. As to the 
code-1, code-4 and code-5 specimens, the 
effect of differing the N2:H2 ratio on the 
specimen’s fracture toughness is also dependent 
upon the substrate material. The fracture 
toughness ( tF ) results for the DC11 and DC53 
steel materials show the same sequence ( tF )1:3 
> ( tF )1:1 > ( tF )4:1; whereas, the results for the 
specimens of the SKH51 steel show the 
sequence ( tF )1:3 > ( tF )4:1 > ( tF )1:1. These two 
sequences show the same trend that an increase 
in the hydrogen content to a sufficiently high 
level is helpful to elevate the specimen’s 
fracture toughness. In Fig.7, the fracture 
toughness ( tF )1:3 of the DC53 substrate is 
much higher than that of the other two substrate 
materials. Under the same conditions of the 
implantation temperature and the N2:H2 ratio, 
the fracture toughnesses show the sequence 
( tF )DC53 > ( tF )SKH51 > ( tF )DC11; and the 
specimen hardness show the sequence (H)SKH51 
> (H)DC53 > (H)DC11, for all these five kinds of 
specimens. It is interestingly found that a 
specimen with a larger fracture toughness is 
also possible to have a higher specimen 
hardness. The time required for the occurrence 
of fatigue wear was investigated by differing 
the implantation temperature and the N2:H2 
ratio in the gas mixture. The experimental 
results are shown in Fig.8. The common 
behavior demonstrated in these three substrate 
materials indicates that the elevation in the 
implantation temperature is helpful to increase 
the fatigue life (FL) of a specimen. Significant 
increases in fatigue life due to the elevation of 
implantation temperature took place in the 
SKH51 specimens. The influence of the 
hydrogen concentration in the gas mixture on 
the fatigue life of a specimen is still dependent 
upon the substrate material, the highest fatigue 
life always occurred in a specimen with 
N2:H2=4:1. Therefore, an increase in the 
concentration of nitrogen in the gas mixture is 
helpful to increase the fatigue life of a 
specimen. 
The X-ray diffractometer (XRD) was 
applied to detect the new phases formed in 
these eighteen kinds of specimens, including 
three pure substrate materials (DC11, DC53 
and SKH51 steels) without the nitrided layer. 
Six diffraction patterns for each of these three 
substrate materials are presented in Fig.9(a) to 
Fig.9(c). The initial structure of an untreated 
specimen can be identified as bcc Fe-rich α  
10 
 
depth. In the backward movement, the normal 
force was unloaded so that the indenter was 
applied to measure the topography of the wear 
track after finishing the elastic recovery. The 
scratch depth generated by the scratch test in 
the (i)th cycle was thus obtained from the 
difference in the topographies of the wear track 
formed at the (i-1)th and (i)th cycles. Fig.10 is 
given as the example to show the topographies 
of wear track generated in the forward and 
backward movements of ten cycles. The 
implantation conditions are shown in each of 
these three plots. In these figures, the number i 
(i=1, 2, 3, …, 10) marked near each curve 
indicates the topography generated at the (i)th 
cycle, irrespective of the forward or backward 
movement. Because the scratch depths 
produced in a cycle varied with the scratch 
position, an average value of these local scratch 
depths was needed in the evaluation of wear 
resistance. This figure shows part of the 
topographies of the wear track after finishing 
the elastic recovery to be a negative value. This 
means that the topography after a scratch wear 
is unexpectedly higher than that before this 
scratch wear. This was caused by the stacking 
of the wear debris at the scratch track. These 
wear particles could not be removed and 
adhered to the wear track. In general, adhesive 
wear often occurs in the wear processes of 
metallic materials when they contact with a 
hard material as the counterpart. Therefore, 
these wear particles are believed to be mostly 
produced by the specimen. 
    The D parameter is defined to be the 
average value of the wear track depths created 
at one scratch cycle. It is obtained from the 
wear track after finishing the elastic recovery. 
Figure 11(a) to Fig.11(c) show the experimental 
results of D for the substrate materials of DC11, 
DC53 and SKH51, respectively. The curves in 
these three figures below the dash line of D = 0 
or the curves with a negative slope imply that a 
relatively severe adhesive wear took place. 
These three substrate materials can be 
classified into two groups according to the 
effect of nitrogen implantation on the scratch 
wear resistance. The scratch depth for the 
“pure” DC11 or “pure” SKH51 specimen is 
larger than that created in the specimens with 
the same substrate material but different 
nitrogen implantations. Therefore, the ion 
implantations can enhance the scratch wear 
resistance. However, the adhesive wear 
becomes severe too. As to the “pure” DC53 
specimen, only the average scratch depths 
generated in the front part of these ten scratch 
cycles are positive values. The adhesive wear 
became severe in the rear part of these ten 
scratch cycles such that the average scratch 
depths show negative values. The implantation 
of nitrogen may be not definitely advantageous 
for the reduction of the scratch depth; like the 
DC53 specimen prepared by the conditions of 
N2:H2=1:1 as well as at the implantation 
temperature T = 460. Adhesive wear may 
exist in all these six kinds of specimens with 
different degree; however, the effect of the 
adhesive wear on the average scratch depth is 
strongly dependent upon the nitrided layer 
formed by different implantation conditions. 
The experimental results of D shown in these 
three substrate materials reveal that the 
specimens prepared by increasing the nitrogen 
concentration in the gas mixture may enhance 
the severity of adhesive wear.
