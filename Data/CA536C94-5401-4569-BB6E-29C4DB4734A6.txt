 The primary concern in designing controller for the systems with actuator saturation is the global stability. 
Several works have addressed this issue [11, 12]. However, the obtained stabilizing conditions are valid only for 
open-loop stable systems. For the systems with actuator saturation, the only expected result is the local stability [3, 
19, 22]. Based on the works of [3, 10, 19], the idea of domain of attraction is introduced to resolve the local 
stabilization problem. The domain addressed therein is an area in which the admissible initial states converge 
asymptotically to the origin in the presence of input saturation. Therefore, the design objective is to identify or 
estimate the maximum size of the domain of attraction. Accordingly, many algorithms have been developed to 
predict a system’s performance by applying linear state feedback laws [10, 15] or linear output feedback laws [13]. 
 Recent studies have focused on analysis and synthesis of linear time-delay systems subject to actuator saturation 
[2, 6, 16-18]. The phenomenon of time delay is often observed in the reality such as chemical processes, rolling mill 
systems, and long pneumatic or hydraulic transmission lines. In general, time delay is a source of instability and can 
decrease system performance. The design of control law for time-delay systems with input saturation is more 
complicated than designing those without time delay. Based on the Lyapunov-Razumikhin and Lypunov-Krasovskii 
functional approach, a set of linear feedback laws in a convex hull is analyzed and designed to obtain the domain of 
attraction [2]. In contrast, the input saturation is characterized by a sector condition and stability conditions are 
explored to determine the domain of attraction [6, 16].  
 Another common, but difficult, control problem is to consider the nonlinear systems with actuator saturation. 
Due to many systems being nonlinear and with constrained input, this problem is practical and needs to be resolved. 
However, the existing literatures focused on this issue are rarely reported. Only a few works have devoted to 
exploration of control scheme [4, 21, 25]. They apply fuzzy control method to deal with stabilization of nonlinear 
system with actuator saturation. Known as a universal approximator, the T-S fuzzy model can approximate a 
complex or nonlinear system that cannot be exactly modeled. Based on this approach, a fuzzy scheduling control 
design [4] is introduced to enlarge the domain of attraction for a T-S fuzzy model-based nonlinear system with 
constrained input. In [21], the saturation is described by a specific nonlinear saturation sector such that an ∞H  
fuzzy controller is established with less number of LMIs. For the discrete-time nonlinear processes with input 
saturation, a piecewise fuzzy anti-windup dynamic output feedback controller is designed [25]. 
 Motivated by the works mentioned above, this investigation is devoted to developing an anti-windup control 
method for an uncertain nonlinear time-delay system with constrained input. The system dynamics is assumed to be 
represented by the T-S fuzzy model. In particular, the sector condition addressed in [6, 16] is modified to provide a 
basis for construction of a control algorithm. Based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii delay-independent and 
delay-dependent analysis, two anti-windup fuzzy control approaches are considered to enlarge the domain of 
attraction.  Extending the design principle, this study also considers the problem of stabilization of uncertain 
nonlinear systems with time delay and input saturation, where the uncertainties are assumed to be time-varying and

where pc Rtx ∈)( is the controller state, ciE is the anti-windup gain, cici BA  , and ciC are the controller matrices 
with appropriate dimensions. Notably, the premise parts of the dynamic fuzzy controller share the same fuzzy sets of 
the plant fuzzy model. For linear controllable and observable systems without time delay, a strictly proper and stable 
dynamic output feedback controller is utilized to ensure the global stability. However, the analysis and synthesis of 
dynamic controller is more complicated for time-delay systems. For instance, the recent literatures [8, 14] introduce 
guaranteed cost control criteria. The controller is formulated to guarantee the asymptotic stability and minimize the 
upper bound of a given quadratic cost function.

The anti-windup fuzzy controller is designed by ignoring the influence of actuator saturation, and developing a 
dynamic output feedback fuzzy controller, which renders stable control performance. The appendix describes the 
construction of the dynamic output feedback fuzzy controller, which is motivated by the result of [14]. Based on the 
delay-independent analysis, a stabilizing controller is formulated as

Given the initial condition [ ]T007029.05811.0)0( =ξ , which is located at the boundary of the ellipse, and the 
delay time ),9.0cos(1.09.0)( tth += system performance based on the delay-independent control approach is 
investigated. Figures 8-9 display the response of the closed-loop system by using the anti-windup fuzzy controller. 
Fig. 10 depicts an estimated domain of attraction and the system trajectories with different sets of initial conditions. 
The real domain of attraction seems to be greater than the estimated region. However, since the exact domain of 
attract cannot be obtained, the proposed method provides a potentially effective estimation for the region of 
attraction.  
Finally, the robust control scheme constructed via delay-independent analysis is considered.  By Theorem 4 and 
solving the optimization problem (80) with a unit ball as the reference set (i.e. IM = ), the computation results are 
presented in Table 2. The values in the table indicate that the maximum size of the domain of attraction rises as 
τ falls, and the proposed method is less conservative than the dynamic output feedback fuzzy controller in 
estimation of the domain of attraction. Notably, the maximum value of the delay time τ for a feasible solution is 
founded to be 0.99 seconds. Figures 11-12 illustrate the system performance by delay-dependent control considering 
[ ]T007247.05537.0)0( −−=ξ and )2cos(05.005.0)( tth += . The estimate region of attraction was verified 
by evolution of trajectories corresponding to different initial states, as plotted in Fig. 13.  The simulation results 
demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. 
6. Conclusions 
The problem of control saturation and its influence on the stability and performance of the closed-loop system has 
been studies for years. In spite of extensive literatures focused on this topic, most of these results are concerned with 
plants that are linear, time-delayed, or nonlinear and based on fuzzy model. Control approaches for nonlinear 
time-delay systems with input saturation have rarely been investigated to our best knowledge. The main contribution 
of this work is to develop fuzzy control approach for such systems. Based on the T-S fuzzy model, an anti-windup 
fuzzy control scheme is formulated, in the context of delay-dependent and delay-independent, to deal with the 
systems with/without uncertainties. Sufficient conditions to establishment of local stability of a region of attraction 
are derived. These conditions are then formulated as an LMI convex optimization problem, allowing the fuzzy 
controller to be synthesized easily and an estimate of the domain of attraction to be maximized as well. It is proved
