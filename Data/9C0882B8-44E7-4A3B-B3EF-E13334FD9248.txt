一、前言、研究目的及文獻探討 
In analog signal processing applications, the transadmittance (i.e. input as voltage and output as 
current) and transimpedance (i.e. input as current and output as voltage) modes may play a very 
important role in the special filtering applications where we need to connect a voltage mode circuit 
with a current mode circuit and vice versa. Since the transadmittance and the transimpedance modes 
can act as the bridge transferring from voltage-mode to current-mode and vice versa, respectively, 
we may be desirable to have active filter with input currents or/and voltages and output currents 
or/and voltages, defined as mixed-mode [1-28, 44-46] or multiple-mode filters (including voltage, 
current, transadmittance [2-4, 9], and transimpedance [1, 26, 45, 46] modes) [5-8, 10, 12-17, 19-25, 
28, 44]. Therefore, the multiple-mode circuits are worthy of research and presented for the use of 
any filtering requirement which is compatible with modern microelectronic systems applications, 
such as controls and voice and data communications, where consideration of size and weight make 
the use of inductors prohibitive.   
In the past several decades, some current conveyor-based dual-mode [26, 27, 45, 46], 
mixed-mode or general mixed-mode (namely multiple-mode) filters [6-8, 12-17, 19, 21, 28] were 
proposed and had shown that many resistors were unavoidable. Since OTA or CCCII-based filter 
structures don’t need any resistors in the realized circuit structures, several dual-mode [9, 11, 18], 
mixed-mode or multiple-mode filters using OTAs or CCCIIs [5, 10, 20, 22-25, 44] have been 
presented recently. However, only a few filters [10, 20, 25] can realize universal filtering responses 
in all four possible modes. Moreover, all these circuits [5, 9-11, 18, 22-25, 44] can not realize 
high-order filtering responses. Only one [20] (reported by C. N. Lee (敝人) and C. M. Chang    
(張俊明教授)) can realize high-order universal filtering responses (i.e. lowpass, highpass, bandpass, 
bandreject, and allpass) in all four possible modes (i.e. voltage, current, transadmittance, and 
transimpedance modes). However, the structure [20] offers some following disadvantages: need of 
extra inverting amplifiers for realizing voltage and transadmittance modes allpass signals, need of 
the two same nth input current (In) for current output and voltage output, and inconvenient input 
currents settings for realizing current and transimpedance modes highpass, bandreject, and allpass 
signals.   
In this project, two new high-order multiple-mode (including voltage, current, transadmittance, 
and transimpedance modes) OTA-C universal filter structures are proposed. The first structure only 
uses n+2 OTAs and n grounded capacitors which can realize nth-order all five standard filtering 
functions in all four possible modes without changing the filter topology. The first proposed 
structure achieves all of the advantages reported in [20]. Moreover, it uses a fewer current replica 
than [20] in the multi-output OTA. Furthermore, the first proposed structure does not need the two 
same nth input current signals ( nI ) [20] to construct current output ( outI ) and voltage output ( outV ). 
The second structure only uses n+3 OTAs and n grounded capacitors which can realize nth-order all 
five standard filtering functions in all four possible modes without changing the filter topology. 
Although the proposed second structure uses a more OTA than [20], the proposed structure does not 
need extra inverting-type or double-type amplifiers for special input signals and also does not need 
3 
differential-input OTAs and only n floating/grounded capacitors. Moreover, Chang and Swamy 
showed that the differential-input OTA-C universal filter can be transformed to a new 
complementary single-ended-input OTA-C universal filter structure, which has been validated to 
have the more precise output signals even than single-ended-input OTA-based one. However, the 
structure [40 (ASM-I)] uses some floating capacitors in the design and needs extra inverting 
amplifiers for realizing all-pass response. Moreover, a voltage follower is necessary at the output of 
all OTA-based voltage-mode filters to buffer the output due to high output impedances of the OTAs. 
On the other hand, the employment of grounded capacitors is ideal for integrated circuit 
implementation. Hence, it is quite interesting to develop a high-order OTA-C universal filter 
structure using less number of active components than the recent works [35-39, 40 (ASM-II)] and 
grounded capacitors (ideal for integrated circuit implementation), which has no need of any buffers 
and inverting amplifiers.  
From a historical progress point of view, we might intend to replace the traditional voltage-mode 
circuits with the more precise current-mode circuits. There might be a transferring period from 
voltage-mode to current-mode. Then, the transadmittance-mode (i.e. input as voltage and output as 
current) will be involved in conversion between voltage and current modes. Thus, 
transadmittance-mode circuits are worthy of research. Since the OTA has high input and output 
impedances which can cascadably connect the former voltage-mode stage and the latter 
current-mode stage without using any buffers, it is very suitable for transadmittance-mode circuit 
applications. Therefore, this leads to prospective research work: investigating and developing a 
high-order transadmittance-mode OTA-C universal filter structure using reduced number of active 
components and grounded capacitors, which can realize nth-order transadmittance-mode universal 
filtering responses (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, band-reject, and all-pass) from the same 
topology and has no need of any buffers, inverting, and non-inverting amplifiers.   
Additionally, in this project, a new high-order transadmittance-mode OTA-C universal filter 
structure derived from the proposed multiple-mode high-order circuits is introduced. The new 
proposed structure achieves the above four important advantages (i) using less number of active 
components (i.e. only n+1 OTAs) than the recent works [35-39, 40 (ASM-II)], (ii) using only 
grounded capacitors unlike [40 (ASM-I)], (iii) the realization of all five universal filtering responses, 
and (iv) no need of any buffer and inverting or non-inverting amplifiers. With respect to the 
reference [40 (ASM-I)], although the proposed transadmittance-mode structure uses a more OTA, 
the proposed structure does not need (i) inverting-type input voltage, (ii) any buffer, and (iii) 
floating capacitors in the design. As far as transadmittance-mode is concerned, the proposed 
high-order transadmittance-mode OTA-C universal filter using n+1 OTAs and n grounded 
capacitors is the minimum components.

From (2)-(7), the proposed high-order multiple-mode (including voltage, current, transadmittance, 
and transimpedance modes) universal filter transfer functions can be obtained according to input 
current or voltage conditions as shown in section 3. Hence, the designed input-output relationship 
matrix form (i.e. Eq. (1)) can realize high-order multiple-mode universal filter transfer functions. 
The proposed multiple-mode high-order OTA-C universal filter structure based on Eq. (1) is shown 
in Fig. 1 of the Section 3. Because the proposed filter structure based on Eq. (1) needs 
inverting-type input voltage signals and double-type input current signals for realizing all-pass filter 
transfer function, the second designed input-output relationship matrix form is proposed in Section 
2.2.   
2.2  Mathematical model of the second proposed high-order multiple-mode OTA-C universal 
filter 
To realize the second proposed high-order multiple-mode OTA-C universal filter structure which 
has no need of inverting-type input voltage signals and double-type input current signals, we 
arrange the input-output relationship matrix form as below:

From Eqs. (10)-(15), the high-order multiple-mode (including voltage, current, transadmittance, 
and transimpedance modes) universal filter transfer functions can be obtained according to input 
voltage or current conditions as shown in section 3. Hence, the second designed input-output 
relationship matrix form (i.e. Eqs. (8) and (9)) can realize high-order multiple-mode universal filter 
transfer functions which has no need of inverting-type input voltage signals and double-type input 
current signals for realizing any filter transfer functions. The second proposed multiple-mode 
high-order OTA-C universal filter structure based on Eqs. (8) and (9) is shown in Fig. 3 of the 
Section 3.  
On the other hand, because the OTA has high input and output impedances which can cascadably 
connect the former voltage-mode stage and the latter current-mode stage without using any buffers, 
it is very suitable for transadmittance-mode circuit applications. Additionally, in this project, a new 
high-order transadmittance-mode OTA-C universal filter structure using the minimum components 
derived from the second proposed multiple-mode high-order circuit is introduced.

The choice of the −+ /  of ( )000 Vga  term is based upon an even/odd order n of the high-order 
filter, respectively. From Eqs. (18) and (19), the high-order transadmittance-mode universal filter 
transfer functions can be obtained according to input voltage conditions as shown in section 3. 
Hence, the third designed input-output relationship matrix form (i.e. Eqs. (16) and (17)) can realize 
high-order transadmittance-mode universal filter transfer functions. The proposed 
transadmittance-mode high-order OTA-C universal filter structure using the minimum components 
based on Eqs. (16) and (17) is shown in Fig. 5 of the Section 3. 
 Observing all of the coefficients in D(s) for all the proposed matrix forms, since an consists of 
the product of all n capacitances, an-1 consists of the product of n-1 capacitances and 1 
transconductance (i.e. ng )…, an-i consists of the product of n-i capacitances and i 
transconductances……, and a0 consists of the product of all n transconductances, all filtering 
parameters produced from the coefficient in the denominator are orthogonally controllable. In 
addition to this advantage, the coefficient sensitivity to each transconductance or each capacitance 
is easily calculated and equal to 0 or 1, both of which are low. For n = 2, in all the above cases, the 
resonance angular frequency 0ω and the quality factor Q are given by

三、研究結果與討論 
3.1  The circuit structure and discussion of the first proposed high-order multiple-mode 
OTA-C universal filter  
By the definition of matrix multiplication, we can obtain n+2 nodal equations of the first 
proposed circuit structure from Eq. (1). By using the OTAs and the grounded capacitors to

Fig.2 Sixth-order transadmittance and voltage modes highpass filter where g0 can be either eliminated or included 
13 
all-pass filter transfer functions. Moreover, the new proposed structure provides more convenient 
input currents settings than [20] for realizing current and transimpedance modes highpass, 
bandreject, and allpass signals. For example, the new structure uses a single current input signal 
instead of n same current input signals [20] for realizing the nth-order high-pass filter signal. 
Furthermore, the new one does not need double-type input current signals [20] for realizing the 
current and transimpedance modes nth-order all-pass signals and also does not need the two same 
nth input current signals ( nI ) [20] to construct current output ( outI ) and voltage output ( outV ).To 
illustrate the second proposed multiple-mode high-order filter structure, a sixth-order current and 
transimpedance modes highpass filter is shown in Fig. 4. 
 
 
 
 
Fig.3  The second proposed multiple-mode nth-order OTA-C universal filter structure

Note that it is no need to (i) change the network topology, (ii) impose passive component choice. 
Moreover, the design does not need inverting-type input voltage signals or double-type amplifier for 
realizing any filter transfer functions. 
With respect to the voltage-mode high-order OTA-C filters in [35-39, 40 (ASM-II)], the proposed 
circuit in Fig. 5 uses less active components and no buffers. With respect to the reference [40 
(ASM-I)], the proposed structure in Fig. 5 does not need inverting-type input voltage, any buffers, 
and floating capacitors in the design. As far as transadmittance-mode is concerned, the structure 
using n+1 OTAs and n grounded capacitors is the minimum components.  
We also note that the OTA(g0) can be eliminated or included in the high-pass and band-pass 
filters. To illustrate the proposed transadmittance-mode high-order filter structure, a sixth-order 
bandpass filter is shown in Fig. 6.

given 10pF, and g1=50μS (for Fig. 1 and Fig. 3), g0=g2=100μS (for Fig. 1 and Fig. 3), g3=g4=200μS, 
g5=100μS (for Fig. 3), and g3=200μS, g4=100μS (for Fig. 1) for current-mode and 
transimpedance-mode third-order (i.e. n=3, gn=g3) all-pass filters of the Fig. 1 and Fig. 3. The center 
or resonant frequency of the simulated filters is located at f0 = 1.5915MHz. Their supply voltages 
are given by VDD = -VSS = 1.65V. Fig.8 presents the simulated sixth-order lowpass, bandpass, 
highpass, and bandreject amplitude frequency responses of the transadmittance-mode filter of the 
Fig.1. However, the simulation results of Fig. 8 do not include theoretical values. Hence, the 
comparisons of simulations and theoretical values are shown in Figs. 9-14. Fig. 9 presents the 
simulated sixth-order lowpass, bandpass, highpass, and bandreject amplitude frequency responses 
of the proposed voltage and transadmittance mode filters (shown in Fig. 1) with the normalized 
transadmittance magnitude = 20 log |

（英文）Two new high-order multiple-mode (including voltage, current,
transadmittance, and transimpedance modes) universal filters are designed. 
The first proposed filter structure employs n+2 plus-type operational 
transconductance amplifiers (OTA+s) and n grounded capacitors. The second 
proposed filter structure employs n+3 operational transconductance 
amplifiers (OTAs) and n grounded capacitors which has no need of extra 
inverting or double-type amplifiers for special input signals. The two 
proposed filter structures can realize nth-order voltage, current, 
transadmittance, and transimpedance modes universal filtering responses 
(low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, band-reject, and all-pass) from the same 
topology. Moreover, the two new multiple-mode universal filters still enjoy 
many important advantages: using only grounded capacitors, no need of any
resistors, cascadably connecting the former voltage-mode stage and the latter 
current-mode stage, and low active and passive sensitivities. On the other 
hand, since the OTA has high input and output impedances, it is very suitable 
for transadmittance-mode circuit applications. Hence, a new high-order
transadmittance-mode OTA-C universal filter structure using the minimum 
components derived from the proposed high-order circuits is introduced. The 
proposed transadmittance-mode structure uses only n+1 OTAs and n
grounded capacitors, which are the minimum components necessary for
realizing an nth-order transadmittance-mode universal filtering responses 
(lowpass, highpass, bandpass, bandreject, and allpass) from the same 
topology. This represents the attractive feature from chip area, and power 
consumption point of view. Moreover, the proposed high-order
transadmittance-mode circuit still enjoys the following advantages:
cascadable feature, no need of extra inverting or double-type amplifiers for 
special input signals, using only n grounded capacitors, no need of any 
resistors, and low sensitivity performance. H-spice simulation and Matlab 
confirm the feasibility and the accuracy of the circuits.
