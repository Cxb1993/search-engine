1.  Introduction 
Humans are usually exposed to various persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in 
daily life. These POPs can cause serious diseases and adverse bioaccumulation effects 
in the environment, and the polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and 
polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) are of particular concern. The 
2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-para-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD) has been categorized as a 
group 1 agent (i.e., carcinogenic to humans) by the International Agency for Research 
on Cancer (IARC) which is part of World Health Organization (WHO). The 
2,3,7,8-TCDD have been shown to be risk factors for soft-tissue sarcoma, 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma, malignant neoplasm [1] and cancer [2], although the 
pollutant is not a direct genotoxin [1]. One of the 2,3,7,8-TCDD genotoxic hypothesis 
is the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-mediated alteration in the expression of 
networks of genes involved in cell growth and differentiation. The AhR pathway was 
also the principal of the Xenobiotic Detection Systems - Chemical Activated 
LUciferase gene eXpression (CALUX) bioassay. 
A food survey from Department of Health (DOH) Taiwan indicated that the 
highest PCDD/F concentration(3.28 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat) among nine pasteurized 
milk samples was higher than the European Union (EU) limit (3.0 pg WHO-TEQ/g 
fat) in 2004. In the same year, the TDOH released draft concentration limits for 
 6
(blood plasma [10, 11], human milk [12]), and environmental media (soil and 
sediment [13]). However, a few studies have conducted PCDD/F analysis of cow’s 
milk by using CALUX method, and different matrices could be contained some 
materials (e.g. metals) that could be effecting the luciferase [14, 15].  
The objectives of this study were first to set up and validate quality criteria 
obtained with the CALUX bioassay for the dioxin analysis of spiked cow milk 
samples. The application of this bioassay was then tested by performing analysis of 28 
commercial available pasteurized milk samples and comparing the results with the 
reference method for PCDD/F analysis. 
 
2.  Materials and methods 
2.1 Sample collection and preparation 
In September 2006, a total of 28 pasteurized milk samples produced by 8 
companies were collected from two chain stores and two supermarkets in Southern 
Taiwan. All the 28 milk samples were full fat grand milk. The fat contents that were 
printed on the containers of each sample were from 3.3% to 4.1%, and the average 
was 3.7% w/w. Each sample was given a sample number and stored at 4 °C until 
extraction. 
One of the milk samples was spiked with PCDD/F standard solution (EPA-1613 
 8
extraction. The water and impurities in the extract were removed by passing it through 
an extraction column, which contained both celite (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and 
anhydrous sodium sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Using nitrogen blowing to 
completely remove the solvent and water in the extract. Transferring the fat to pass 
through an acid silica gel column and a XCARB column to purify extracted milk fat. 
The acid silica gel column was mainly constituted by 45% w/w sulfuric acid silica gel 
(Merck, Germany) and anhydrous sodium sulfate. The XCARB column was mainly 
constituted by 1% XCARB/Celite (XDS, USA) and anhydrous sodium sulfate. The 
PCDD/Fs from the XCARB column were collected and dissolved in toluene and 
concentrated to dryness by using vacuum centrifuge concentration. 4 mL n-Hexane 
(TEDIA, USA) was used to dissolve the PCDD/Fs, and then the sample was stored at 
4 °C until analysis. 
Luciferase activity was measured by using Wallac VICTOR3 1420 Multilabel 
Counter with a dispenser (PerkinElmer, USA) to inject the luciferase reagent 
(Promega Corp, USA) automatically. The data for the 2,3,7,8-TCDD (Wellington 
laboratories, Canada) calibration standards  curve (250, 125, 62.5, 31.3, 15.6, 7.81, 
3.91, 1.95, 0.977, 0.488, 0.244 pg-TCDD/mL medium, STD1 - STD11) were fitted 
to a Hill’s 4 parameters sigmoid curve, and the QC standard (diluted the 1613 stock 
to 0.250 ng I-TEQ/mL DMSO ) and samples’ bioassay data were transferred to 
 10
HRGC/HRMS. 
The HRGC (Agilent 6890 Series gas, CA) was equipped with a DB-5 MS fused 
silica capillary column (60 m × 0.25 mm , film thickness = 0.25 μm) (J&W Scientific, 
CA) and with a splitless injection. Helium was used as the carrier gas. The HRMS 
(Micromass Autospec Ultima, Manchester, UK) was equipped with a positive electron 
impact (EI+) source. The analyzer mode of the selected ion monitoring (SIM) was 
used with resolving power at 10 000. The electron energy and source temperature 
were specified at 35 eV and 250 ºC, respectively. The QA/QC criteria followed the 
U.S. EPA Method-1613B [19]. 
 
3.  Results and discussion 
3.1 Quality Control Criteria for the CALUX Bioassay 
Because the internal standard, 13C labeled PCDD/F congeners, could be harmful to 
the H1L1.6 cells. The quality control (QC) criteria were used to make sure the 
CALUX bioassay system was stable and reliable for the quantification of PCDD/F 
concentration in the pasteurized milk samples. The QC standard and PE samples were 
used to make the QC criteria of the reproducibility and consistency of the CALUX 
bioassay system, [20]. 
The repeat bioassays sensitivity profiles of the CALUX bioassay were according 
 12
3.2 Quality Control Criteria for milk analysis 
The 16 SM samples were analyzed during pre-validation test. The SM samples 
were analyzed first, and examined the results of SM samples before the validation test.  
Fig. 2 is the control chart of 16 SM samples, similar with QC standards, all data were 
between the warning limits. As shown in Table 2, the data of CALUX bioassay are 
from 3.99 to 8.62, with an average of 6.49 pg TEQ/g fat. U.S. EPA defined a relative 
standard deviation (RSD) smaller than 20% means high precision for CALUX 
bioassay [13], and the definition of EU criterion was smaller than 30%. The RSD of 
SM samples was 20.7% which meant the precision of CALUX was acceptable. The 
control chart also conformed to the decision rules of Western Electric [21]. 
Besides the CALUX bioassay, all the SM samples were also analyzed by using 
HRGC/HRMS as the reference method, and the values were 3 pg WHO-TEQ/g 
fat.The PCDD/F recovery efficiencies were calculated from the ratio of values of SM 
samples and its equal TEQ standard solution determined by CALUX bioassay, and the 
standard solutions were determined by CALUX bioassay directly without 
pretreatment. The PCDD/F recovery efficiencies of SM samples were from 60.4% to 
106% with an averaged of 79.9%. The results of PCDD/F recovery efficiencies of 
CALUX were in the recovery efficiency criteria range of HRGC/HRMS (from 40% to 
130%), it meant the PCDD/F recovery efficiencies of CALUX were acceptable for 
 14
environmental matrices. As a semi-quantitation method, the results of the CALUX 
bioassay values were transformed by multiplying a CF (CALUX*CF), which was a 
simple method to estimate the PCDD/F TEQ. As describe in Table 2, a new data set 
was created from the values determined by CALUX bioassay, the average ± SD of the 
data was 3.36 ± 0.697 pg TEQ/g fat. Following the report from U.S. EPA [13], the 
determination of accuracy was based on agreement with certified levels of PE samples. 
The definition of accuracy (R value) is the average bioassay value divided by the 
certified value, and the idea R value would be 100%. In addition, the data 
comparability was evaluated by calculating a relative percent difference (RPD) 
between the values determined by the CALUX bioassay and HRGC/HRMS. The RPD 
values between positive and negative 25% indicated good agreement between the 
CALUX*CF and HRGC/HRMS measurements. In this study, R values are from 
54.4% to 118% (mean 88.5%) and the RPD values are from 1.42% to 50.1% (mean 
19.4%) while CF was 0.409. 
Sixteen SM samples were analyzed by the CALUX bioassay and the results were 
shown in Table 2. As showed in Fig. 4, the values of 16 SM samples determined by 
the CALUX bioassay were normal distribution with confidence level 95%. 
Considering the probability of type I error and type II error were the same (α = β = 
5%) [24], the confirmation range was between the lower boundary of the confirmation 
 16
CALUX*CF and the HRGC/HRMS for pasteurized milk samples by using paired 
samples t-test. The result indicates no statistically significant difference (p = 1.14) 
with confidence level 95%. The results of paired samples correlations indicate the 
Pearson’s correlation coefficient between these two analysis methods with confidence 
level 95% is 0.547 (p < 0.01). 
Table 3 also shows that all the WHO-TEQ of PCDD/Fs contents for pasteurized 
milk samples are below the recommended EU non-commercialization threshold value 
of 3 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat. Examining the semi-quantitation results of 28 pasteurized 
milk samples and 10 PE samples in Table 3. The number of false positives sample is 
one (2.63%) and false negatives sample is zero. The false negative rate of PCDD/Fs 
screening method is smaller than the criteria in EU ( < 1%) [25]. However, when the 
CALUX is taken as a screening method and the same false positive samples are in the 
confirmed area, these samples should be re-checked by the reference method. In this 
way, there will be no samples that over the regular standard being made a wrong 
judgment. 
 
4.  Conclusions 
The control chart for the QC chart and STD6 standard ( in the μ ± 2σ range ), and 
the LOD ( 0.168 pg TEQ/g fat) and the LOQ ( 0.335 pg TEQ/g fat) were obtained
