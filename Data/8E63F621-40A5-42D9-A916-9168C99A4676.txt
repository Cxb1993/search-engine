I. Abstract
In this study, field emission characteristic of the silver-catalyzed ZnO nanostructure grown
on silicon by vapor-phase transport process was investigated. The ZnO nanostructures were
grown on different temperature and time. The structure and optical properties of ZnO
nanostructures were investigated using scanning electron microscopy SEM, X-ray diffraction
X-ray and photoluminescence analyses. X-ray diffraction measurements showed that the main
grown plane of ZnO nanostructures was (002) plane. The ZnO nanostructure has diameters
ranged from 50−200 nm and length from 2−4 μm. The optimal field emission property of ZnO 
nanorods was obtained when it was synthesized at temperature 680oC for 60 min at region C. The
turn-on electric field for ZnO nanorods was 5.23 V/μm. When the electric field was 8.46 V/μm
and a phosphor screen was used as anode, the emission current density approached 20.5μA/cm2.
Bright phosphor image was observed from the diode mode field emission lighting.

II. Introduction
Nanostructures have attracted much attention owing to their peculiar and fascinating
properties [1,2]. Since the discovery of carbon nanotubes in 1991 [3], one-dimensional (1D)
nanostructures, including nanotubes [4-6], nanowires [7-9], and nanorods [10-12], are studied
actively because of their unique physical properties and potential to revolutionize broad areas of
nanotechnology. 1D nanostructures represent the smallest dimension structure that can efficiently
transport electrical carriers, and thus are ideally suited to move charges in integrated nanoscale
systems [13]. In addition, owing to quantum confinement, 1D nanostructures can demonstrate the
characteristic of light emission [14]. Therefore, 1D nanostructures are expected to play an
important role as both interconnects and functional units in electronic, optoelectronic,
electrochemical, and electromechanical devices with nanoscale dimensions.
Recently, 1-D nanostructures such as wires, belts, rods, and tubes have also become the
dominate research subjects owing to their unique applications in mesoscopic physics and
fabrication of nanoscale devices. 1-D nanostructures, exhibiting photonic and electronic
confinement in two-dimensions, have attracted considerable interest as potential candidates for a
variety of nanoscale electronic and optoelectronic devise [15-18].
Zinc oxide is a highly complex material with some unique properties which give rise to many
of its scientific and technical applications. Some especially properties of ZnO are: the anisotropy
in crystal structure, the non-stoichiometric defect structure, the broad band gap, the high
reflectivity in visible and strong absorption in ultraviolet, and dissociative sublimation and
was observed. When the growth time was increased from 10 minutes to 30 minutes, lots of ZnO
nanorods were grown at 1050oC; however, when the growth temperatures were at 1100oC and
1150oC, no ZnO nanorods were grown. When growth temperature was at 1050oC for 60 min,
nanorods were grown.
Fig. 1 shows the SEM images of ZnO nanorods grown at 1050oC for (a) 10, (b) 30, and (c) 60
minutes.
The XRD patterns in Fig. 2 show that the ZnO nanorods was a wurtzite structure. The lattice
constants of ZnO nanorods were a = b = 3.26 Å and c = 5.22 Å. The strong (002) peak at θ= 34.4o
and other small peaks originated from the hexagonal ZnO were observed. The main growth plane
of ZnO nanorods was (002) for grown temperature at 1050oC. XRD data exhibited dominant
peaks at 34.4o, 31.7o and 36.2o were corresponding to ZnO (002), (100) and (101) planes.
The optical properties of the ZnO nanorods were characterized by the PL spectra
measurement at room temperature. In Fig. 3, it is not only the emission peak centered at 384 nm
(3.23 eV) in UV band was measured for all the nanostructures, but also a broad green band
(visible emission) with peaks at 493 nm (2.52 eV) was estimated. The UV emission band is due
to a near-band-edge (NBE) transition of wide band gap of ZnO, namely the recombination of free
excitons through an exciton–exciton collision process, while the green band emission is attributed
to the radial recombination of a photogenerated hole with an electron that belongs to a singly
ionized oxygen vacancy in the surface and subsurface lattices of the ZnO materials.
3-2 The ZnO nanorods grown in region B
The temperature of source powders was set at 1050−1150oC and the substrate temperature
was at 1020−1120oC. The grown time was varied from at 10 to 60 min.

XRD patterns shown in Fig. 5 reveal that the ZnO nanorods were a wurtzite structure. The
lattice constants of ZnO nanorods were a = b = 3.26 Å and c = 5.22 Å. The strong (101) peak at θ 
= 36.3o and other small peaks originated from the hexagonal ZnO were observed. The main
growth plane of ZnO nanorod was (101) for as-grown (non-catalyzed), but it was (002) for
7-nm-thick Ag film deposited. The strong peak at θ = 44.4o in Fig. 5(d) was referred to (200) Ag.
The chemical composition of the ZnO nanorods grown on Si substrate was evaluated by energy
dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDX). Figure 6 shows that only Zn and O peaks were observed;
the detected Si peak was come from Si substrate. TEM image of ZnO nanorod grown at 1020oC
for 60 min shown in Fig. 7(a). Figure 7(b) is SAED image. ZnO nanorod (002) direction with the
d-spacing of 2.525 Å was observed. The (101) direction shows that the d-spacing was 2.398 Å.
From PL property shown in Fig. 7(c), it reveals that the nanorods grown at region B exhibited a
better crystallinity.

3-3 The ZnO nanorods grown in region C
The source temperature was set at 1050−1150oC and the substrate temperature was at
620−680oC. The growth time was 10−60 min.
The surface morphologies of ZnO nanorods are shown in Fig. 8. We found that no any ZnO
nanorods were grown up because of the short growth time, 10 min (Fig. 8(a)−(c)). While the
growth time was increased to 30 minutes, nanorods were grown (Fig. 8(d)−(f)). While increasing
the growing time to 60 minutes for a long time growth, the growth of nanorods were observed
obviously. The diameters of ZnO nanorods were about 50−100 nm and their lengths were about
2−4 μm, as shown in Fig. 8(g)−(i). The cross-section images of the ZnO nanorods grown at
620−680oC for 60 min were shown in Fig. 8(j)−(l), which revealed that the ZnO nanorods were
almost vertically grown on Si substrate.
EDX analyses shown in Fig. 9(a) exhibited that only Zn and O peaks were observed. In
addition, XRD pattern shown in Fig. 9(b) exhibited that the dominant peaks were at 34.4o, 31.7o
and 36.2o, which were corresponding to ZnO (002), (100) and (101) planes. The strong (002)
peak at 2θ = 34.4o were observed, this indicated that the main growth plane of ZnO nanorod was
(002). The lattice constants of ZnO nanorod were a = b = 3.26 Å and c = 5.22 Å. PL spectrum in
Fig. 9(c) shown that it is not only a weak UV band with peak at 376 nm a strong broad green
band with peak at 493 nm were observed. Apparently, a lot of surface vacancies were involved in
the ZnO nanorods.
applied on the emitter surface, the electrons will be emitted from metal through the surface
potential barrier into vacuum. In 1928, Fowler and Nordheim proposed the theory of field
emission. The emission of electrons from a metal-vacuum interface in the presence of electric
field normal to the surface was initially treated as a quantum mechanical tunneling process. The
F-N equation is as follow:

Where J is the current density (A/cm2), E is the applied electric field (V/cm), Φ is the work

Therefore, when d and Φ are fixed, we could evaluate the field emission characteristic of field
emitters from F-N equation. To reduce the operation voltage of field emission devices, some
approaches may therefore be taken: (1) Lower the work function of the materials (Φ). (2) Narrow
the cone angle (increases β). (3) Protect the cathode from arc breakdown. (4) Find techniques to
reproducibly sharpen the tips to the atomic level (increases β).
The field emission characteristics of the ZnO nanorods grown in regions A−C are shown in
Fig. 10. For the ZnO nanorods grown in region A, the current of nanorods was 4×10-4 A at 1100 V.
The turn-on electric field approaches 3.84 V/μm in Fig 10(a); the measured current density was
45 μA/cm2 at 8.46 V/μm for ZnO nanorods grown at substrate temperature 1050oC for 1 hr.

3 .The field enhancement factor β was about 1078
cm-1 for ZnO nanorods grown at region A. The emission stability of ZnO nanorods grown at
region A was measured at constant electric field of 8.46 V/μm, as shown in Fig. 10(b). The max
emission current density was 2.93μA/cm2 and the min emission current density was 1 μA/cm2.
The emission curent density of ZnO nanorods emiter was approximately 1.93μA/cm2 after
applying voltage for 6 h.
For the ZnO nanorods grown in region B, the emission current was 4.35×10-4 A at 600 V for
ZnO nanorods grown at 1020oC for 30 min, and the current was 7.11×10-4 A at 700 V for ZnO
nanorods grown at 1070oC for 30 min. Both two samples can’t stand the high electric field
strength. As the growth time increases, the I-V curves measured with ITO as anode for ZnO
nanorods grown with silver-catalyzer at region B for 60 min was shown in Fig. 10(c). We find the
current was 1×10-5 A at 300 V for ZnO nanorods grown at 1020oC for 60 min; the current was
current density was 15 μA/cm2. The emission current density of ZnO nanorods emitter was
approximately 20μA/cm2 after applying voltage for 6 h.
3-5 Luminescence Characteristics for field emission lighting
For the fabrication of field emission lighting, the ZnS:Ag,Cl phosphor coated ITO glass was
used as anode. The emission current for the lighting was 6.76×10-5 A at 1100V for nanorod
emitters grown in region A, as shown in Fig. 11(a). Furthermore, the emission current of the
lighting for nanorod emitters grown in region C was measured as well. Fig. 11(b) shows that the
emission current density for the lighting was 3.66 μA/cm2 at 8.46 V/μm when the nanorod
emitters were grown at substrate temperature of 620oC for 1 hr. The turn-on electric field
approaches 4.92 V/μm and the current density for the lighting was 3.66 μA/cm2 at 8.46 V/μm
with a luminance of 39.29 cd/m2 at 1100 V. In the meantime, we found that emission current was
3.98μA/cm2 at 8.46 V/μmand the luminance was 34.87 cd/m2 at 8.46 V/μm for nanorod emitters
grown at substrate temperature 650oC. The current densitywas 20.5 μA/cm2 at 8.46 V/μm and the
luminance was 291.4 cd/m2 at 8.46 V/μm while the nanorodemitters were grown at substrate
temperature of 680oC. The cathodoluminescence (CL) image of the field emission lighting
involved ZnO nanorod emitters together with a ZnS:Ag,Cl phosphor screen is shown in Fig. 12(a);
the CIE coordinates were shown in the inset of Fig. 12(a). Fig. 12(b) is the luminance intensity
