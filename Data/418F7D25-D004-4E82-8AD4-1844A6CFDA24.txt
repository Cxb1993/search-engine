identiﬁcation of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) as
the primary cellular receptor for AAV serotype 2 (AAV2)
[16], heparin-column chromatography has been applied in
puriﬁcation of AAV2 particles from the lysate of packaging
cells [17]. Despite this unique AAV2-heparin binding, to
our knowledge there appear to be no previous reports of
this afﬁnity binding being applied to conjugate recombi-
nant AAV2 (rAAV2) to a tissue substrate for transgene
delivery.
In this work, we aimed to crosslink heparin molecules
with a wound-care substrate, OASISs Wound Matrix
(Cook Biotech Inc.), to allow for rAAV2 conjugation and
transduction upon cellular adhesion. OASISs Wound
Matrix is an acellular, collagen-based extracellular matrix

Plasmid pAAV-LacZ (Fig. 1A), carrying the expression cassette of
b-galactosidase ﬂanked by AAV2 ITRs (inverted terminal repeats), was
purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA, USA). Plasmid pAAV-EGFP
(Fig. 1B), carrying the expression cassette of enhanced green ﬂuorescent
protein (EGFP) ﬂanked by AAV2 ITRs, was constructed by cloning the
0.8-kb EGFP cDNA (HindIII/XbaI fragment) from pEGFP-N2 (Clon-
tech, Mountain View, CA, USA) downstream from the CMV promoter in
pAAV-MCS (Stratagene) to yield pAAV-EGFP. Plasmid pAAV-Lucifer-
ase-EGFP (Fig. 1C), carrying the expression cassettes of luciferase (CMV-
driven) and EGFP (SV40-driven) ﬂanked by AAV2 ITRs, was constructed
as previously described [27]. Production, puriﬁcation, and titration of
rAAV2 were performed as previously described [28] using the AAV
Helper-Free System (Stratagene). Brieﬂy, HEK293 cells were co-trans-
fected with the rAAV2 vector plasmid, along with pAAV-RC (Stratagene)
and pHelper (Stratagene). For each 100-mm dish, HEK293 cells were
transfected with 2.5mg of each of the three plasmids and 15ml of
FUGENE 6 reagent (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Transfected cells were harvested 3 days after
transfection. Puriﬁcation of rAAV2 particles followed the protocol

increased when more heparin was used in crosslinking.
However, the percentage of the incorporated heparin over
the feed heparin decreased following an increase in
heparinization. Speciﬁcally, when 10mg of heparin were
used in the reaction, the incorporated heparin was 19.7 mg
(0.2% of the 10-mg feed heparin) per piece of SIS
(1 cm 1 cm, approximately 150 mm thick, and 4.0mg
weight), analyzed by the toluidine blue assay. This amount
was obtained by subtracting the endogenous GAGs

sulfate A and B, heparin, and heparan sulfate [18,30])

(endogenous GAGs+incorporated heparin molecules) in

of the incorporated heparin in all subsequent tests.

linking on cell proliferation in H-SIS, we analyzed

in H-SIS and in SIS. These results indicated that EDC/NHS-
mediated covalent crosslinking was mild and that H-SIS
exhibited minimal, if any, toxicity toward seeded cells.
3.3. Binding of rAAV2 to H-SIS
In this binding experiment, we incubated H-SIS with
rAAV2 suspended in PBS and analyzed the amount of
rAAV2 adsorbed onto the H-SIS matrix. Fig. 4 reports the
percentage of adsorbed virus particles, which was deter-
mined from the difference between the feed titer and the
residual virus titer in solution, and then normalized against
the feed titer. Under the test conditions, 49.9% and 78.3%

A value of 100 was assigned to the feed virus titer in the solution. The
percentage of adsorbed rAAV2 was calculated as (feed virus titerresidual
virus titer) 100%/feed virus titer. Experiments were performed in
quadruplicate independently for each. Bars indicate standard deviation.
the rAAV2-heparin binding was reversible and capable of
mediating transduction upon cellular adhesion. Addition-
ally, in Fig. 5F, we show that transduction caused by
rAAV2 released from the H-SIS substrate was less efﬁcient
than transduction upon cellular adhesion. An 80%
decrease in transduction efﬁciency was observed when
rAAV2-loaded SIS and HT-1080 cells were separated by a
transwell membrane to avoid direct contact, relative to a
direct seeding of HT-1080 cells onto the substrate.
3.5. H-SIS mediated rAAV2 transduction using crude
packaging cell lysate
Generation and puriﬁcation of infectious AAV vectors
for transgene delivery are costly and labor intensive.
Without puriﬁcation, rAAV2 in the crude lysate of
packaging cells barely possesses any activity. One of the
current protocols for rAAV2 puriﬁcation applies heparin-
agarose in column chromatography to adsorb rAAV2
particles from the lysate of packaging cells [17]. The

analyzed transgene expression after seeding ﬁbroblasts

results showed that H-SIS was capable of adsorbing

cells, avoiding the use of conventional ultracentrifugation
or chromatography in the preparation of infectious rAAV2
for transduction.
4. Discussion
Localized rAAV2 delivery would allow for vector
administration at a desired tissue site to regulate the area
of transgene expression. Such delivery could be achieved by
vector conjugation to tissue substrates for transduction
upon cellular adhesion. In this study, we developed H-SIS
and examined its ability of rAAV2 binding and transduc-
tion. We used EDC/NHS-mediated crosslinking to incor-
porate heparin molecules into the SIS matrix to produce
H-SIS, which possessed minimal toxicity toward seeded
cells (Fig. 3).
H-SIS was capable of adsorbing rAAV2 suspended in
PBS (Fig. 4). When adsorbed, rAAV2 remained active and
capable of carrying out transduction upon cellular adhe-
sion (Fig. 5), suggesting that the binding of rAAV2 with
heparin was reversible. H-SIS was also capable of
adsorbing unpuriﬁed rAAV2 directly from the lysate of
packaging cells for conjugation and transduction (Fig. 6);
this approach combined substrate-mediated transduction
and chromatographic techniques to avoid the use of
laborious puriﬁcation processes such as ultracentrifugation
or column chromatography in preparation of infectious
rAAV2 for transduction. Until further analysis is carried
out in vivo, these data suggest the possibility of similar
success in transgene delivery in animal models.
Of the available cell growth supports for tissue repair
and regeneration [31], SIS-based scaffolds have been
used in patients for wound treatment, general soft tissue
reconstruction, reinforcement of weakened tissue, and
treatment of urinary incontinence [18–20,32–34]. In this
study, we successfully conjugated rAAV2 to OASISs
Wound Matrix, a wound care product of SIS, suggesting
the potential of associating rAAV2 with other SIS products
for targeting different tissues. Implantation of rAAV2-
loaded SIS is expected to initiate transduction in vivo.
Alternatively, ex vivo transduction could be accomplished
by isolating primary cells from patients, transducing them
upon cellular adhesion, and then implanting the genetically
modiﬁed cell-SIS construct to the patients. Prior to
implantation, an ex vivo culture of the patient’s cells in
SIS would provide a window of time to analyze transgene
delivery, such as to detect the DNA integration sites in
chromosomes to protect the safety of patients receiving
gene therapy [35].
Cellular surfaces and the extracellular matrix possess
receptors for binding macromolecules, such as growth
factors, in response to physiological cues and for regulating
ls 28 (2007) 2350–2357 2355cellular functions. Interestingly, these receptors are also
explored by viruses as binding sites for internalization. For
