(KALMAN FILTER FOR PSEUDO CODE-DELAY AND DOPPLER FREQUENCY
TRACKING IN GPS RECEIVER)
abstract
A GPS receiver first acquire coarsely positioning parameters from at least four satellites in the initial-positioning
stage and then constantly track the pseudo-code delay and phase (frequency) parameters in order to obtain accurate
position of the receiver. In this report, we focus on the latter code-delay and phase tracking stage; we exploit the
well-known Kalman algorithm to develop new code-delay and phase-delay tracking algorithm which yields faster
as well as more accurate tracking performance. Computer algorithms are performed to verify the usefulness of this
approach.
1 Introduction
Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation receiver must acquire and track four GPS satellites at least. In order
to track and decode the navigation data from the received signal, an acquisition process must detect the presence of
the GPS signal. Once the GPS signal is detected, the coarse PRN code delay and Doppler frequency can be obtained
and passed to the tracking program. The function of the tracking program is to demodulate the PRN signal and to
obtain the navigation data. If the initial code delay and the Doppler frequency from the acquisition process are not
accurate enough, the tracking program must make more effort to achieve the fine resolution of the code delay and
Doppler frequency. The conventional tracking process using a early-late method via a closed loop with a loop filter.
In this thesis, we choose the Kalman filter to realize the loop filter. According to the DDLL and DPLL model [3], the
message and measurement model of the Kalman filter can be established [6]. The Kalman filter has the advantage of
easy design and the high reliability to achieve the fine performance. In our proposed method, we find that it is easy
to increase the tracking speed, to reduce the design complexity, and to obtain the accurate value of code delay and
Doppler frequency.
Although GPS signal tracking is a mature subject, there is still some ways to improve the tracking speed and
the design complexity. A Costas loop tracking method is presented in [2] and [1]; it is using the early-late method
to find the code delay and Doppler frequency via a PI loop filter. Another loop filter in the DPLL is presented in
[13]; it is using a fuzzy bandwidth controller (FBC) to realize the loop filter, and the FBC provides a time-varying
bandwidth. Due to the structure of the DDLL and DPLL system, we can design different kind of loop filters. In
the methods discussed above, the filter design is uncertain as a result of more fluctuant performance if we design
the filter inadequately. In reference [15], a new method is that a extended Kalman filter is used to obtain the code
delay in the presence of the multipath. In reference [14], they propose a space-time adaptive processing (STAP)
algorithm for delay tracking and acquisition of the GPS signature sequence using the extended Kalman filter (EKF),
and the algorithm is shown to track the desired timing having high speed and fine resolution. The DDLL and DPLL
model are presented in [3]. In our proposed method, we apply the idea of [14] and [15] to establish the state-space
model of the EKF based on the structure of the DDLL and DPLL model [3]. It can obtain the fine resolution without
increasing design complexity.
2 GPS TRACKING SYSTEMS
In GPS receiver, the initial acquisition obtains coarse estimates of code delay and Doppler frequency shift. The latter
tracking uses digital delayed-locked loop (DDLL) and digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) to yield more accurate
estimates of code delay and code-phase such that precise positioning of the GPS receiver can be obtained. This
section discusses in detail of the tracking system.

2.3 DPLL Tracking
A digital phase-locked loop is used to extract the accurate carrier phase of the input GPS signal by differencing the
incoming Doppler-shifted carrier with locally generated signal. The DPLL consists of a loop filter, a carrier phase
discriminator, and a numerically controlled oscillator (NCO) as shown in Fig. 6. The phase discriminator works

where ∆ωd(k) = ωd(k) − ωˆd(k), φ(k − 1) is the accumulated phase component generated by the previous input
signal, and the general form is expressed as
φ(k) = (ωb + ωd(k))×N + φ(k − 1) (26)
φ(k − 1) is the accumulated phase component generated by the previous local signal, and the general form is
expressed as
φˆ(k) = (ωb + ωˆd(k))×N + φˆ(k − 1) (27)
We follow the procedure similar to that of deriving (13), and the approximated equation is written as
Q(k) = AR(τ − τˆ)D(n)sinc[∆ωd(k)N/2]e
j(∆ωd(k)+φ(k−1)−φˆ(k−1)) + vQ(k) (28)
where τ = ξTp and τˆ = ξˆTp.
The phase discriminator performs the arctangent operation, which has the output
e(k) = arctan(<[Q(k)]/=[Q(k)]) + nθ
= ∆ωd(k) + φ(k − 1)− φˆ(k − 1) + vθ (29)
where vθ is the phase disturbance due to the input noise, and ∆ωd(k) + φ(k − 1) − φˆ(k − 1) is the phase tracking
error due to a noise-free incoming signal.

2(ρ(k)− δ) −R2(ρ(k) + δ)] (38)

The linear transition matrix F (k) from (37) is
F (k) = 1 (41)
And then we can use the extended Kalman filter algorithm to compute state estimates recursively as shown in
Fig. 11. This leads to the following set of equations as shown in Table 1: Gf (k) is referred to as the Kalman gain,
and K(k) is called as the error covariance.
3.2 DPLL using Kalman Filter
The DPLL system via Kalman filter is shown in Fig. 10 where the state variable is ∆ωd(k). The state variable
∆ωd(k) is defined as
∆ωd(k) = ωd(k)− ωˆd(k) (42)

Substituting (26), (27), and (29) for (47), we can deduce that
Ψ(k) = (ωd(k)− ωˆd(k))×

+ vΨ(k)
=
N
2
(2∆ωd(k) + ωˆd(k)− ωˆd(k − 1)) + vΨ(k) (48)
where vΨ is the phase noise. Thus, if we want to obtain the observation equation, (48) minus N2 (ωˆd(k)− ωˆd(k− 1))
is written as
Ψ(k) = e(k) − e(k − 1)−
N

(ωˆd(k)− ωˆd(k − 1))

(2∆ωd(k) + ωˆd(k)− ωˆd(k − 1)) −
N
2
(ωˆd(k)− ωˆd(k − 1)) + vΨ(k)
= N∆ωd(k) + vΨ(k) (49)
Therefore, we can conclude that the state and observation equation of the DPLL system in the Kalman filter can be
written as
∆ωd(k + 1) = ∆ωd(k) −∆ωˆd(k|Ψ(k)) + v∆ωd(k) (50)
Ψ(k) = N∆ωd(k) + vΨ(k) (51)
According to (51), we can employ the Kalman Filter to estimate the parameter ∆ωd(k) in the linear state-space
equation. The linear measurement matrix H(k) from (51) is
H(k) = N (52)
The linear transition matrix Φ(k) from (51) is
Φ(k) = 1 (53)
Therefore, we can compute the state estimates recursively by the Kalman filter algorithm as shown in Fig. 11. This
leads to the following set of equations as shown in Table 2. Gf (k) is referred to as the Kalman gain, and K(k) is
called as the error covariance.

6 CONCLUSIONS
In this report, the DPLL and DDLL system using Kalman filter algorithm is employed to develop an fast code delay
and Doppler frequency tracking method for the GPS receivers. Then, combining DPLL and DDLL system method
is presented such that the tracking speed is increased and the design complexity is reduced. Computer simulations
demonstrate that for GPS applications the proposed method performs satisfactorily with a higher tracking speed and
a lower design complexity. The proposed approach, naturally, is not limited to GPS applications, it can be applied to
the tracking applications of any communications via the direct sequence spread spectrum.
