The study of the relationship between internal defect and electrical properties on intermediate 
temperature LaGaO3-base electrolyte materials 
 
Abstract  
The aim of this study was to develop La1-xBaxGa1-yMgyO3-δ (x = 0.03–0.1, y = 0.2–0.25) (LBGM) 
electrolytes for intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs); these electrolytes were synthesized 
via a solid-state reaction. The study’s La1-xBaxGa1-yMgyO3-δ samples crystallized in an orthorhombic (Imma) 
structure, and a BaLaGa3O7 phase was detected for x ≥ 0.08 at a fixed y = 0.2. The solubility limit of the Ba 
ions increased with an increase in the Mg content in the matrix. Two active Raman bands were observed at 
ca. 677 and 739 cm-1, and they were attributed to the oxygen vacancies. The La0.95Ba0.05Ga0.75Mg0.25O3-δ 
sample had a higher conductivity (≈0.1 S/cm) at 800°C, and an activation energy of ca. 0.83–1.27 eV at 
500–800°C. The thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of the LBGM samples at 200–800°C was in the range 
of 10 × 10-6 to 14 × 10-6/°C.

1. Introduction 
Fuel cells are electrochemical devices that directly convert chemical energy into electrical energy in a 
highly clean, cheap and efficient way. Solid oxide fuel cells using 8YSZ ceramics as solid electrolyte 
requires high operating temperature 900~1000oC, resulting in serious problems such as chemical reaction 
between components, thermal degradation of materials or cracking during cycles.1 Lowering the operation 
temperature to 600~800oC is called intermediate temperature SOFC. La1-xSrxGa1-yMgyO3-δ (LSGM) samples 
are a good purely ionic conductor (> 0.1 S/cm at 800oC), a high chemical stability at oxygen partial 
pressures (PO2) of 10-22~1 atm, and a stable performance over long operating times.2,3 Although the 
conductivity is slightly smaller than Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 in 600~800oC.4,5,6 
For the La1-xBaxGa1-yMgyO3-δ materials, the oxygen-ion conductivity is slightly lower than that of 
LSGM materials. Structures of LSGM perovskite had investigated from many researchers.7,8,9,10 The crystal 
structures of Sr/Mg-doped lanthanum gallate have orthorhombic (Pnma (abbreviate to “PO”) and Imma 
(IO)), monoclinic (I2/a (M)), rhombohedral (R3തc (hR)), and cubic (Pm3തm (C)) structures from room 
temperature to high temperature. They are very difficult to distinguish between last four crystal structures by 
using convenient X-ray powder diffraction method, because they are merely slight distorted at different 
levels for perovskite-type structures. The LBGM system also should have the similar transformed structures, 
but they were less investigated.  
Oxygen vacancies are also created by doping divalent ions replaced La and Ga sites, and they will 
improve the ionic conductivity.5 So the LBGM materials can be used as the alternative electrolyte. S. M. 
Choi et al11 reported the ionic conductivity of La0.9Ba0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ was 0.1 S/cm at 800oC. S. Kim et al12 
reported the solubility limit of BaO increase with increasing amount of MgO, and the activation energy in 
the low-temperature region is higher than in the high-temperature region. 
The present work, the La1-xBaxGa1-yMgyO3-δ compositions have been prepared by solid state reaction, 
and the microstructure and electrical properties also were measured by a series of instruments. The purpose 
of work is to discuss the relations between electrical properties and microstructure changes for various 
compounds.

also measured by dc four-probe method in air, the applied voltage was 10 V, and the operating temperature is 
carried out from 500oC to 800oC at an interval for 50oC. 
3. Results and Discussion 
3.1 Structural analysis 
Figure 1 shows XRD patterns of La1-xBaxGa1-yMgyO3-δ (x = 0~0.1, y = 0~0.25) samples sintered at 
1550oC for 12 hrs. Two extra peaks (2θ ≈ 48o, 54o) appeared in LaGaO3 (Fig. 1 (a)), so it is judged to 
PO-phase (JCPDS 83-0566, Pnma). LBGM samples are almost single phase, and BaLaGa3O7 phase (JCPDS 
50-1800) was detected (2θ ≈ 29.9o) only in LBGM0820 and LBGM1020. However, the structures of LBGM 
samples are very difficult to distinguish between IO-, M-, hR- and C-phases from convenient X-ray powder 
diffraction method (Fig. 1). The exact structure has not been identified for LBGM samples. The difference of 
these structures is the amount of tilting of corner-shared GaO6 octahedra. BaLaGa3O7 phase is insulator, and 
will lower entire conductivity. In this sintering condition, solubility limit of Ba ions on La sites was ca. 5 
mole% in La1-xBaxGa0.8Mg0.2O3-δ system due to larger Ba ionic size (Ba2+(0.161 nm) > La3+(0.136 nm)). The 
solubility limit of Ba ions on La sites increases as the Mg ions substituted on Ga sites increases.  
3.2 Raman spectra  
Raman spectroscopy is a useful tool for analysis of local vibration modes, phase transition, and oxygen 
disorder. Consequently, Raman spectra of LBGM samples were also carried out, and try to further verify the 
crystal structure.  
G. A. Tompsett et al.14 reported that the 17 bands of O-LaGaO3 and 4 bands of hR-LaGaO3 observed at 
294 K and 773 K in the Raman spectrum, separately. They are 55(Ag), 92(B1g), 101(B3g), 117(B2g), 137(B1g), 
147(Ag), 173(B3g), 255(Ag), 277(Ag), 335(B3g), 357(B1g), 404(B3g), 417(B2g), 433(Ag), 451(B3g), 584 
(overtone), and 708 (overtone) cm-1 for O-LaGaO3, and 444(Eg/Eg), 232(Ag), 159(Eg) and 55(Eg) cm-1 for 
hR-LaGaO3.14 
Figure 2 showed the Raman spectra of LaGaO3 and LBGM measured at room temperature. In this 
study, the sharp 10 bands observed in range 50~500 cm-1 for pure LaGaO3 as in the bands of 97, 108, 123, 
155, 175, 255, 278, 407, 437, and 455 cm-1, so the structure of pure LaGaO3 is judged to PO-phase. There 
are sharp 4 bands observed in range 50~500 cm-1 for LBGM samples as in the bands of 97, 153, 266, and 
433 cm-1 (Fig. 2(b)~(f)), and two active bands of ca. 677 and 739 cm-1 appeared in the 550~900 cm-1. The 
intensity of two active bands depends on the content of Ba and Mg ions. The results are similar to the LSGM 
report of T. Inagaki et al.15, and they reported the bands at ca 700 cm-1 depend on the composition of doped 
LaGaO3. Two active bands of ca. 677 and 739 cm-1 in LBGM system are induced by decreasing of local 
symmetry due to introducing the oxygen vacancies15 as equation (1). 
BaO+SrO
LaGaO3ሱۛ ۛۛ ሮ BaGa' +SrLa' +VO·· +2OOX  (1). So doping Ba and Mg ions are effective to produce oxygen 
vacancies, and further improve ionic conductivity of pure LaGaO3. So the peak shapes of ca. 680~700 cm-1 
change with variations of local symmetry environments induced by the kinds of amounts of dopants. The 
crystal structures of LBGM have changed when comparing to the PO-phase of pure LaGaO3 (Fig. 2(a)~(f)), 
and the data explained that crystal structure could be changed from low symmetric PO-phase to high 
symmetric structure by doping aliovalent ions, and the Raman-active vibration modes will decrease with 
increase of crystal symmetry, for example LaGaO3 to LBGM. Therefore, Raman spectra depend on the 
amount and kind of the doping ions, and are sensitive to structural transition. The exact structures of LBGM 
5 
 
reason is not clear, so the further analyzed works of TMA, DTA and TG will be carry out to understand the 
possible mechanisms. 
Plot of activation energy versus composition in the different temperature (500~550oC, 550~700oC, and 
700~800oC) is shown in Fig. 5(a) and the data listed in Table 1. For LBGM0820, and 1020 samples, the 
variations of activation energies are larger in three temperature ranges, and have not a tendency. It is 
because secondary phase segregated at grain boundaries. The Ea values have a slight variations (0.83~1.27 
eV) in LBGM0320, 0520, and 0525 samples, and higher Ea values showed in the range of 550~700oC. The 
LBGM0525 has higher conductivity than other samples as shown in Fig. 5(b) at 800oC. 
3.5 Thermal expansion analysis  
Figure 6(A) shows thermal expansion analyses of the LBGM samples, and the measuring temperature 
range is from 25oC to 800oC. Thermal expansion coefficient is an important subject for the SOFC’s 
application. The physical expansion coefficient () is the slope of the relative length-change curve at the 
respective temperature (T) (equation (3)) as shown in Fig. 6(B). (T) = (1/lo)(dl/dT)p    (3) 
where lo is the initial length of sample. The TECs of LBGM0320, LBGM 0520, LBGM 0820, and LBGM 
1020 at 200 ~ 600oC are about in the range of 10~11×10-6 K-1, and increase to ~14×10-6 K-1 up to 800oC. 
Unusually, two turning points were observed at ~560oC and 720oC. This results are consistent with the 
change of slope at the range 500oC~800oC as Fig. 4 (B). The sharpest turning point is observed at ~560oC, 
and the cause is not clear. The TEC value has not obvious vary with increasing the Ba content (x = 0.03 to 
0.1) at fixed 0.2 mole Mg, and the TEC values of the LBGM system are similar as the report of the 
LSGM2020 (10~11.57×10-6 K-1)20 at 600oC. 
The differential thermal analyzer (DTA) and thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) analysis of the 
LBGM0520 and 1020 samples are shown in Fig. 7. There is not any sharp exothermic or endothermic peaks 
was detected in the DTA curves, so no sharp transformation occurred during 30oC~800oC for LBGM0520 
and 1020 samples. It is worth paying attention to the TG curves as in Fig. 7. The obvious changes in weight 
varied with change of temperature. The weight increases with increasing temperature at the threshold of 
375oC ~475oC, and the increasing weight was about 0.15% at 800oC. The most possible cause is the 
increasing weight was contributed from the increasing of oxygen ions in the LBGM0520 and 1020 samples. 
The results verified that the ionic conductive mechanism had changed or the gradual transition between 
orthorhombic (Imma), monoclinic (I2/a), and rhombohedral (R3തc), and they occurred at 375oC ~475oC for 
LBGM system.  
3.6 TEM analysis  
The microstructure and phase identification of LBGM samples were analyzed by using TEM 
technology. The appearance of grains shows the square shape in LBGM0820 was observed in Fig. 3(d) and 
the similar image was also observed in Fig. 8(a). Figure 8 is the TEM bright field (BF) images and SAED 
pattern of grain A in the LBGM0820 sample. Grain A has apparent facets, and the facets had been took to the 
(1ത01)PO and (1ത01ത)PO that having the lowest surface energy. The SAED pattern was indentified to Z = 
~[010]PO of pseudo-orthorhombic (Pnma) structure due to the small and weak diffraction spots as shown by 
arrow. It shows the doping Ba ions are less dissolve into the LaGaO3 matrix to induce the fully phase 
transformation to Imma structure due to the occurrence of liquid phase. 
Figures 9 and 10 show the SAED patterns and Kikuchi map of regions B and C in the LBGM0520 and 
LBGM0525 samples. Stacking faults were observed in both samples. A series of diffraction patterns of 
7 
 
in the Pnma system are rather different to other four structures, especial for DPs of Z = [010]PO and [210]PO 
in Fig. 14(a)(a-2). However, Some DPs are difficult to distinguish from each other due to the similar 
distances and angles of diffraction spots, eg. three simulated primary DPs in the O-phase of Imma vs. that of 
the hR-phase (as shown in Fig. 14(b)(b-1)(b-2) and 14(d)(d-1)(d-2)), and M-phase vs. C-phase (as Fig. 
14(c)(c-1)(c-2) and 14(e)(e-1)(e-2)). So the structures of LBGM0520 and LBGM0525 samples were decided 
to be orthorhombic (Imma) structure from the analysis of Fig. 14(b)(b-1)(b-2), and the LBGM0820 were 
decided to be close to ~Pnma structure.  
4. Conclusions 
The La1-xBaxGa1-yMgyO3-δ (x = 0.03~0.1, y = 0.2 and 0.25) electrolytes were synthesized by solid state 
reaction at 1550oC for 12 hrs. BaLaGa3O7 liquid phase was detected in LBGM0820 and LBGM1020. The 
solubility limit of Ba ions was ca. 0.05 mole at fixed 0.2 mole Mg in this study and it increases as increasing 
the Mg ions. Grain size decreases with increasing of Ba ions. Two active bands of ca. 677 and 739 cm-1 
contributed from the oxygen vacancies were observed. LBGM0525 sample has higher conductivity ~0.1 
S/cm at 800oC, and the activation energy is ca. 0.83~1.27 eV at 500oC~800oC for LBGM0320, 0520, and 
0525 samples. The crystallographic relations between the orthorhombic, monoclinic, rhombohedral, and 
cubic structures were analyzed. The structures of LBGM0520 and LBGM0525 samples were orthorhombic 
Imma structure and the LBGM0820 were close to ~Pnma structure.
