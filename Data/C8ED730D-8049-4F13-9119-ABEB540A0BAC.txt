英文摘要
Deoxyribonuclease I (DNase) was encapsulated in egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (EYPC)
liposomes with stabilizers, such as calcium chloride. The stability of liposomes was studied with
the addition of charged lipids or astaxanthin. DNase or DNase-liposomes was further
encapsulated in poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microspheres. The sustain release of
DNase from liposome-PLGA microspheres were observed in the first 24 hr. Among those
formulations, DNase encapsulated in astaxanthin stabilized liposomes and PLGA microspheres
showed the highest DNase activity after release. The formulation may be useful with dry powder
inhaler to provide better dosage control.
Keywords: DNase, liposome, encapsulation, pulmonary delivery
the liposome-DNase conjugate was further encapsulated in biodegradable polymer, PLGA, using
w/o/w double emulsion method. The PLGA microspheres were then freeze-dried and ready for
release study.
Materials and Methods
Liposomes were prepared using the film hydration method and followed by extrusion. 200
mg of egg york phosphatidylcholine (EYPC, M.W. 768, from Sigma) was dissolved in 10 ml of
chloroform. Chloroform was then evaporated by rotary evaporation to yield a thin lipid film on
the wall of round bottom flask. In the case of adding stabilizer, astaxanthin (from Sigma) were
added at 1:120 molar ratio into the lipid solution. EYPC with lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC,
from egg, Sigma) or dipalmitoylphosphatidylserine (DPPS, from Sigma) at 120:1 molar ratio
were also prepared. The dry lipid film was hydrated with 0.01 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 to
form large multilamellar vesicles (LMV). LMVs were then extruded through polycarbonate filter
(pore size 0.2μm, Millipore) to produce small unilamellar vehicles (SUV).
DNase I (from bovine pancreas, Sigma) was dissolved in PBS buffer to make 40 mg/ml
solution. 1 mM PMSF (phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, from Sigma) was added as protease
inhibitor. DNase was added to different dry lipid film with or without astaxanthin in a 1:1 weight
ratio during the hydration process. The large multilamellar vesicles were extruded through 0.2μ
m polycarbonate membrane 10 times at 42°C. Liposomes were collected after centrifuged (L8-80,
Beckman) at 300000g for 20 min. The size of liposomes was characterized with dynamic light
scattering particle size distribution analyzer (Horiba LB-500). Liposomes were disrupted with
0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 to release encapsulated DNase. The encapsulated amount of DNase was
determined by Protein Assay (BioRad). The activity of DNase was determined with Hoechst
H33258 fluorescent dye [9].
DNase solution and DNase-liposome conjugate were encapsulated in PLGA (50:50 from
Bio Invigor). 100 mg of PLGA polymer was dissolved in methylene chloride and made up to 2 ml
in total. 150l of DNase solution (2 mg/ml in PBS buffer) or DNase-liposome conjugate was
added to PLGA polymer solution on ice. The first emulsion was formed by probe sonication
(Tekmar sonic disruptor) with 30 sec pulse cycle for 5 min. Second emulsion was performed by

To develop the dry powder formulation, DNase in solution or liposomes was encapsulated in
PLGA and lyophilized. PLGA were also mixed with polylysine to make porous microspheres.
The microspheres were examined with SEM and the size of particle was calculated (Table 1). The
Conclusion
Astaxanthin was found to stabilize liposomes and DNase during the emulasion process.
DNase-liposomes conjugate in microspheres showed steady release profile and without initial burst, which
are desirable for sustained release system. The clearance pathway of the PLGA microspheres should be
studied in the future to understand the safety issue of delivering DNase and other protein drugs via
pulmonary route.

Encapsulation of DNase into astaxanthin-EYPC liposomes showed lower encapsulation efficiency
than that in EYPC liposomes (Table 1). The results suggested liposomes stabilized with astaxanthin may
resist the disruption of pluronic F-68 and prevent a burst release of DNase in the early phase.

DNase encapsulated in PLGA was released in PBS buffer. The results showed about 22% of
encapsulation efficiency based on DNase activity. DNase-liposome conjugate encapsulated in PLGA
retained about 14.8% of activity. Encapsulating DNase-liposomes with PLGA led to about 5% loss in activity.
The PLGA-liposomes system can be freeze-dried and avoided the leakage of DNase during the long term
storage.
CONCLUSION
DNase can be encapsulated into different microspheres and retained up 22% of activity. The results
demonstrated the quick release profile for DNase encapsulation systems. The long term release should be
discussed in the future to show the capability of those systems for sustained release. Those encapsulation
systems can be applied to deliver other protein drugs via pulmonary route.

ABSTRACT SUMMARY
Deoxyribonuclease I (DNase) was encapsulated in egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (EYPC)
liposomes with/without astaxanthin as stabilizer. DNase or DNase-liposomes was further
encapsulated in poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA). The encapsulation efficiency of those
systems was compared. DNase retained up to 22% of activity in PLGA system, and showed
lower activity in astaxanthin stabilized liposomes.
INTRODUCTION
The completeness of sequencing human genome leads to increasing interest in the
study of proteomics, which interprets the dynamic process in the life of cells. Understanding
protein interactions creates the opportunity for the development of new protein drugs. Many
protein drugs are now tested in different clinical phases. However, developing noninvasive
delivery tool for protein drugs is still a challenge.
Recombinant human deoxyribonuclease I (DNase) was formulated in calcium chloride
dihydrate and sodium chloride solution by Genetech, and marketed as Pulmozyme.
Pulmozyme was delivered as aerosol to deep lung to treat a genetic disorder lung disease,
cystic fibrosis (1). Aerosolization with nebuliser resulted in the exposure of DNase in the
air-water interfaces, which may cause the denaturation of DNase. The aggregation of aerosol
particles may also increase the deposition in the mouth and throat that reduces the delivery
efficiency. Maa et.al. had prepared DNase powder with spray-coating technology (2). However,
thermal denaturation of DNase and agglomeration of powder hampered its clinical application.
To develop controllable encapsulation system for pulmonary delivery of DNase, we
encapsulated DNase in liposomes and astaxanthin stabilized liposomes. It was reported that
astaxanthin was solubized in lipid membrane and could increase the rigidity of lipid bilayers (3).
To extend the shelf-life of liposomes and avoid the leakage of DNase, the liposome-DNase
conjugate was further encapsulated in biodegradable polymer, PLGA, with w/o/w double
emulsion method. The PLGA microspheres were then freeze-dried and ready for release
study.
EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
Liposomes were prepared using the film hydration method and followed by extrusion. 20
mg of EYPC, (from Sigma) was dissolved in chloroform and dry lipid film was formed with
rotary evaporation. Astaxanthin may be added (1 : 120 molar ratio) into the lipid solution as the
stabilizer. The interaction between astaxanthin and liposomes was monitored with fluorescent
probe Laurdan, which located in the glycerol backbone of the lipid bilayers and used to
represent the status of water rotation in lipid bilayers (3). DNase was added during the
hydration process. The large multilamellar vesicles were extruded through 0.22μm 
polycarbonate membrane. Pluronic F-68 was used to disrupt liposomes and release DNase.
The encapsulated amount of DNase was determined by Protein Assay (BioRad). The activity
of DNase was determined with Hoechst H33258 fluorescent dye (4).
DNase solution and DNase-liposome conjugate were encapsulated in PLGA (50:50 from
Bio Invigor). 100 mg of PLGA polymer was dissolved in methylene chloride and made up to 2
ml in total. 150 l of DNase solution (2 mg/ml in PBS buffer) was added to PLGA polymer
solution on ice to form the first emulsion by probe sonication (Tekmar sonic disruptor). Second
emulsion was performed by pouring the first emulsion into 50 ml of 1 % aqueous polyvinyl
