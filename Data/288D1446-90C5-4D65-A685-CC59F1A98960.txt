2Abstract
In this project, we measured the phase equilibrium properties of the binary mixtures
containing methanol with methyl esters. Additionally, the kinetic behavior of biodiesel
production from non-catalytic transesterification and esterification with a continuous
supercritical process was investigated in this study. In transesterification reaction, the
biodiesel was produced from refined sunflower oil and methanol in the presence of
carbon dioxide at the conditions of 0Bθ (the molar ratios of methanol to triglyceride)
from 20 to 60 and 0E (the molar ratio of CO2 to methanol ) = 0.1, temperatures
from 553 K to 593 K, and pressures from 100 bar to 250 bar. The reaction rate and
free fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield increase with increasing reaction
temperature and those appear to be insensitive to pressure. The FAME yield increases
with 0Bθ , but it reaches a constant as 0Bθ greater than 25.
In esterification reaction, the biodiesel was synthesized from the oleic acid and
methanol. The experimental runs were conducted at *0B (the molar ratios of
methanol to oleic acid) from 2 to 5 and temperatures from 493 K to 533 K under 100
bar. The conversion of oleic acid increases with increasing reaction temperature and
feed molar ratio of *0B . The reaction rate was significantly enhanced as the
esterification was conducted at the supercritical condition of methanol.
The kinetic data of both transesterification and esterification were correlated with
power law models to determine the kinetic parameters. The correlated results show
that the models represent well the kinetic behavior of the transesterification and the
esterification reactions for biodiesel production.

Introduction
1-1 The development of biodiesel production technology
In the development of the biodiesel production technology, Rudolf Diesel first
tested vegetable oil as fuel for the engine about one hundred years ago. However the
high viscosity of vegetable oil caused compression ignition problems in the engine
(Shay, 1993). Until the end of the twenty century, the oil price raised year by year and
reached the record high in 2008 because of the reduction of the crude oil production
and the economy storm. Consequently, the alternative fuels become more attractive in
the world. A lot of kinds of alternative energies were suggested such as solar energy,
wind power, fuel cell, and biodiesel, etc. Among these alternative energies, the
biodiesel is a popular and immediately usable alternative energy. It can be made from
a wide variety of renewable biological sources such as vegetable oils and animal fats.
Moreover, it is an environmentally friendly energy source because of its
biodegradable, low emission, and nontoxic (Krawczyk, 1996).
Since the volatility of vegetable oil is substantially low, the oil can not complete
burning and leading to deposit formation in the engine. When the oil was converted
into biodiesel, its properties became quite similar to petroleum diesel. In Table 1-1,
the properties of diesel and biodiesel are listed (Lotero et al., 2005). As a consequence,
the biodiesel may directly be used without modifying the engine (Klopfenstein and
Walker, 1983).
There are four primary ways to produce biodiesel, including dilution (blending),
thermal cracking (pyrolysis), microemulsions, and transesterification. Among these
methods, the transesterificaion is the most commonly one to produce biodiesel from
vegetable oils and animal fats (Fangrui and Milford, 1999).
6when the alkali catalysts are used. The triglycerides and alcohols used have to be
highly anhydrous (Wright et al., 1944). When the free fatty acid level is above 5 %,
the saponification is happened. The soap inhibits the separation of the methyl esters
and glycerol and contributes to emulsion formation during the water washing.
Moreover, the presence of water makes the saponification taking place and the soap
formation decreases the yield of esters (Gerpen, 2005). Consequently, a highly pure
feedstock is required for alkali-catalyzed reaction. The higher purity of feedstock to
be used, the higher cost has to spend on removing the impurity from raw materials.
Accordingly the feedstock cost is in the neighborhood of 60~75 % in biodiesel
production and the pretreatment of the raw materials may be unacceptable in industry.
Alternatively acid catalysts are compatible with tolerance of using low grade of raw
materials. The free fatty acids react with alcohols via esterification reaction and the
transesterification of oils with alcohols, simultaneously. However, it takes much
longer reaction time (at least 2 hours) by using acid catalysts in biodiesel production.
Keim (1945) used homogeneous acid catalyst in the first step to convert the free fatty
acids in the feedstock to methyl esters and thereby reduce the free fatty acid
concentration. The low pretreated oil of free fatty acid was then transesterified with
methanol by using alkali catalyst to produce methyl esters. With the two-step method,
a yield of 97 % was found as the palm oil contained 50.8 % of free fatty acid.
1-2-2 Heterogeneous catalyst
It is effective to achieve high FAME yields by using homogeneous catalysts. But it
leads to another problem that makes essential the treatments of product purification.
These essential treatments translate into higher production cost. Moreover, to compete
commercially with petroleum-based diesel fuel, limiting the number of separation
units and using a robust heterogeneous catalyst are necessary (Lotero et al., 2005).
8transesterification reaction. For example, Macario et al. (2010) produced biodiesel by
using an acid-base catalyst. Another ion-exchange catalyst (ITQ-6 surface with K+
ions) has both weak Brønsted acid sites and basic sites. Using this catalyst, the highest
triglycerides conversion and biodiesel yield were achieved over 90 % at 453 K in 24
hours.
Viriya-empikul et al. (2010) used the waste shells of mollusk and egg as catalysts to
produce biodiesel. The shell materials were calcined in air at 1073 K for 2-4 hours to
transform calcium species in the shells into active CaO catalyst. The biodiesel yield
was over 90 % at 333 K and methanol / oil = 18 in 2 hours.
Green solvents, ionic liquids, were also investigated for biodiesel formation. The
chloroluminate ionic liquid was used by Liang et al. (2009) under the conditions of
[Et3NH]Cl-AlCl3 ( x(AlCl3)=0.7 ), 5 g of soybean oil, 2.33 g of methanol, 9 hours, and
343 K. Biodiesel yield of 98.5 % was achieved. The low amount of catalyst
requirement, reusability, and high yield are the key features of the ionic liquid.
Enzymes, a kind of biocatalysts, have shown good tolerance for free fatty acids in
the feedstock (Nelson et al.,1996; Shimada et al., 1999; Wu et al., 1999; Watanabe et
al., 2000), but they are expensive and unstable. Consequently, enzymes are still not
commonly used for biodiesel production.
1-2-3 Non-catalytic reaction
Commercial biodiesel is currently produced via homogeneous / heterogeneous
catalytic reactions. The processes require a high quality of raw materials as feedstock
(using alkali catalyst), catalyst separation or regeneration, and product washing step at
the end of the process. Under the raising of the feedstock cost and environmental
consciousness, the relatively new supercritical synthesis for biodiesel fuel has been
received attention in the recent years.
10
transesterification reaction. Approximate 95 % of biodiesel yield was obtained in 2
minutes under the conditions of 623 K, 450 MPa, and with a molar ratio of methanol /
oil = 42. Table 1-2 compares the characteristics of supercritical method with those of
traditional catalytic method (Kusdiana and Saka, 2001a; Demirbas, 2005, 2008).
Various alcohols have been investigated for the supercritical process (Warabi et al.,
2004). The experimental results revealed that the shorter alkyl chains yielded higher
conversion at the same reaction time. The highest yield of alkyl ester (approximately
100 %) was obtained in 15 minutes with methanol.
Besides the nature of alcohols affects the biodiesel production, reaction temperature
also strongly governs the conversion of triglycerides and the yield of alkyl esters in
supercritical process. The transesterification rate increases with increasing reaction
temperature. High yield and conversion were found at temperatures higher than 573K
(Bunyakiat et al., 2006; Silva et al., 2007; Vieitez et al., 2009). As to the effects of
reaction pressure, no conclusive result has been obtained. Warabi et al. (2004) and
Bunyakiat et al. (2006) reported that increasing the pressure didn’t significantly
increase the reaction rate. Different result was found by He et al. (2007), who claimed
that biodiesel yield increased with increasing reaction pressure at a fixed temperature.
Although higher yield and conversion are achieved at higher temperatures, high
temperature may deteriorate the quality of biodiesel. Song et al. (2008) claimed that
the amount of FAMEs decreased when the reaction was operated at temperatures
above 623 K due to the thermal decomposition of refined palm oil or biodiesel.
Imahara et al. (2008) investigated the decomposition behavior with FT-IR analysis.
They pointed out that all fatty acid methyl esters were stable at 543 K and 17 MPa,
whereas the esters were partly decomposed through isomerization from cis-type to
trans-type at 623 K and 43 MPa. In addition to the thermal stability of the biodiesel,
the oxidation stability is also important for biodiesel quality. Xin et al. (2008)
12
temperature and pressure (623 K and 20 MPa) are still required (Saka and Isayama,
2009; Ilham and Saka, 2009, 2010).
1-3 The addition of co-solvent
The resistance of mass transfer, resulting from the partial miscibility of
triglycerides and alcohols, reduces the rate of transesterification. Increasing the
mutual solubility between triglycerides and alcohols may accelerate the rate of
transesterification (Boocock et al., 1998; Boocock , 2001). Consequently, adding
co-solvent into the reaction system is possible to meet the ntarctica . As a proper
co-solvent, its boiling point is better to be near that of the alcohol being used. The
additional complexity of co-solvent recovering and recycling should also be
considered (Gerpen, 2005).
Boocock et al. (1998) and Zhou et al. (2003) used tetrahydrofuran (THF) as a
co-solvent. They found that the reaction was completed in a shorter reaction time by
using NaOH or KOH as catalyst. The necessary reaction time reduced from 15 min to
6-7 min with supercritical technology. Patil et al. (2010) adopted hexane as a
co-solvent. The maximum biodiesel yield of 85 % was obtained in 40 minutes at 563
K, 11.4 MPa and the molar ratio of methanol / oil = 45. Han et al. (2005) used CO2 as
co-solvent and reported that about 98 % of FAME yield was detected in 10 minutes
under the conditions of 553 K, 14.3 MPa, and the molar ratios of methanol / oil = 24
and CO2 / methanol = 0.1. However, Imahara et al. (2009) and Bertoldi et al. (2010)
claimed that the addition of CO2 didn’t significantly influence the yield of
transesterification. The highest yield of biodiesel was no greater than 80 % at 593 K
and 20 MPa. As a consequence, the presence of co-solvent can improve the mutual
solubility between triglycerides and alcohols, but has no conclusive finding for
improving the rate of transesterification. It is still an interesting topic for investigation

adsorption, was conducted at atmospheric pressure. Several types of kinetic models
were applied to correlate the kinetic data of the esterifications. The correlated results
from different models were compared.

2-1-5 Determination of FAMEs
The contents of triglycerides in the refined sunflower oil are complex. When
triglycerides convert to methyl esters, various methyl esters are produced and
analyzed by gas chromatography. An illustrative chromatogram of methyl esters is
shown in Figure 2-2. The total weight of FAMEs produced per min (WFAME) was
calculated with the aid of the calibration curves, which are shown in Figure 2-3 to
Figure 2-7 for various methyl esters, respectively. The definition of FAME yield is
given as follows.

FAME
W
W
YieldFAME  (2-1)
where
0TG
W is the mass of TG in the feed per min. The uncertainty of FAME yield is
estimated as2.3 %.
2-1-6 Validation with literature data
The new apparatus was validated with tested data in comparison with literature
data. The comparison of experimental results with those from Saka group is made in
Table 2-1. Under the same experimental conditions, consistent yield of FAME was
obtained. This apparatus was then used in the subsequent experiments.
26
2-2-1 Pressure effect
Figure 2-8 shows that the FAME yields vary in the range of 0.28 to 0.32 as
pressure changes from 100 bar to 250 bar at a fixed condition of temperature (553 K),
feed composition, and residence time (τ= 30 min). The yields of FAME appear to be
insensitive to pressure. Similar results were also reported by Warabi et al.( 2004b) and
Bunyakiat et al.（2006）. Therefore, the lowest pressure (100 bar) was selected for the
further experiments.
2-2-2 Feed composition effect
Using excess methanol should favor the reaction toward the product. The cost for
recovering the unreacted methanol, however, will increase if methanol is in large
excess. There is an optimal molar ratio of methanol to oil in the feed stream. As
shown in Figure 2-9, the FAME yields reach to a constant (0.43) as the feed molar
ratios of methanol to triglyceride ( 0Bθ ) are greater than 25 at 553 K, 100 bar, 0E =
0.1, andτ≈30 min. Therefore, 0Bθ = 25 was fixed in the further experiments runs.
In addition to the molar ratio of methanol to triglyceride, the molar ratio of carbon
dioxide to methanol ( 0E ) is another process variable. In this study, the effect of 0E
was not investigated. The value of 0E in the present study was fixed at 0.1, which is
the same as Han et al. (2005) and Imahara et al. (2009) .
2-2-3 Temperature effect
Imahara et al. (2008) revealed that biodiesel might decompose and become
unstable while reaction temperatures were higher than 623 K. Thus the experimental
runs were conducted at temperatures from 553 K to 593 K in this study. As seen from
Figure 2-10, the FAME yield is as high as 70 % at 593 K, 100 bar, 0Bθ = 25, 0E =
0.1 in aboutτ= 23 min. The highest yield 72 % was obtained with 0Bθ = 25 and
0E = 0.1 at 593 K and 100 bar asτ= 68 min. The graph also illustrates that the

found that reaction rate and FAME yield increased with increasing the reaction
temperature, but were insensitive to pressure. The yield of FAME could be as high as
70 % with 0Bθ = 25 and 0C = 0.1 inτ=23 min under 593 K and 100 bar. The
presence of CO2 didn’tenhance the reaction rate and increase the yield of FAME. It
was also found that the kinetic data were correlated well with a power law model and
the kinetic parameters were determined.

Non-catalytic esterification of oleic acid with methanol at elevated
pressure
In biodiesel production process, the esterification of free fatty acid (FFA) with
alcohols may occur if feedstock contains FFA. The reaction will be also encountered
after the hydrolysis of oils. Under these circumstances, the kinetic models of the
esterification of FFA with alcohols are needed to develop the process of biodiesel
production. Up to date, the kinetic studies on the esterification of FAA with
supercritical methanol are still limited. Among several authors, Alenezi et al. (2010)
conducted the esterification of free fatty acids with methanol at temperatures from
523 K to 593 K and 10 MPa in a batch reactor. More kinetic studies are essentially
needed for development of the supercritical esterification process.
Among a wide variety of fatty acids (Table 3-1), the oleic acid was selected as the
model compound of feedstock in this study because of its representative and price.
The kinetic behavior of non-catalytic esterification of oleic acid with methanol was
investigated by using a high-pressure tubular reactor. The effects of reaction
temperature and feed composition on the kinetic behavior were observed in the
present study. Also, the kinetic data were correlated with a power law model and the
kinetic parameters were determined.
3-1 Experimental section
3-1-1 Materials
1. Oleic acid (technical grade, 90 ％) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA).
2. Methanol (dried, ＜0.005% H2O) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA).
3. Acetone (for HPLC,99.9 %) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA).

homogeneous phase.
8. Prepare a sample for GC analysis. This sample contains 1 g of product, 1 g of
internal standard solution (0.2 g of heptadecanoic acid dissolved in 9.8 g of
acetone) and 8 g acetone.
Composition analysis
The composition of product samples was analyzed by a gas chromatography (GC)
equipped with flame-ionization detector (FID). The specification and the operating
conditions of GC are listed as follows.
Model : VARIAN CP 3800 (the highest operating temperature : 723.15 K)
Injector: 573.15 K
Oven: 435.15 K for 30 min －＞ 20 K / min
463.15 K for 4 min －＞ 25 K / min
513.15 K for 8 min
Detector: 573.15 K
Carrier gas : Helium
Flow rate : 1 ml / min
Split ratio : initial 100 for 5 min －＞ 20 for 41 min
Column : Select biodiesel for FAME, CP9080, Varian ( 30 m*0.32 mm ID, max.
temperature = 523.15 K)
3-1-5 GC calibration
The calibration curve of oleic acid to heptadecanoic acid (internal standard) is
shown in Figure 3-2. The unreacted oleic acid was calculated from the calibration
result and then the conversion of oleic acid was calculated from eq. (3-1).

reaction condition, pressuredeliveredandetemperaturroomatmix, is the density of mixture of
oleic acid and methanol measured by density meter. V is the volume of the reactor
(subtracting the volume of stainless steel tailings packing), Winlet is the mass flow rate
of the feed, fsyringe pump is the volumetric feeding rate of the syringe pump, v0 is the
total volumetric flow rate in the reactor under the experimental conditions. The
density of feed stream ( conditionreactionatmix, ) was estimated from the density of the
constituent components with neglecting the volume change of mixing. To calculate
densities of the feed stream, the density of oleic acid was estimated from the
correlation as shown in Figure 3-3, while the density of methanol was calculated from
NIST Chemistry Webbook (Table 3-2). The experimental results are reported in Table
3-3.
3-2-1 Feed composition effect
The feed composition effect is shown in Figure 3-4. The conversion of oleic acid
increases with increasing *0B at the same residence time, except for the first two
data points, where the residence times are sufficiently short. The equilibrium
conversion of oleic acid increases from 0.93 to 0.97 with *0B increasing from 2 to 5.
It is feasible for the methyl oleate formation as methanol is in large excess.
3-2-2 Temperature effect
The effect of temperature is illustrated in Figure 3-5. The graph shows that the
reaction rate, conversion of oleic acid and equilibrium conversion increase with
increasing the reaction temperature at fixed feed composition and pressure. Therefore,
the esterification of oleic acid with methanol is an endothermic reaction.

The calculated results from the kinetic model at different temperatures and at
different feed molar ratios are compared with experimental values in Figure 3-6 and
Figure 3-7, respectively. The power law model correlated the kinetic data to the AAD
no greater than 3 %. The rate constant of the forward reaction jumps five-fold from
subcritical to supercritical states of methanol. The rate constants of the forward and
the backward reactions are expressed in the Arrhenius form and plotted in Figure 3-8.
The rate constants of the forward and the backward reactions are expressed in terms
of temperature in the supercritical and the subcritical regions, respectively, as given

acid with methanol for biodiesel production. The experimental runs were conducted at
temperatures from 493.15 K to 533.15 K and pressure of 100 bar under *0B (the
molar ratios of methanol to oleic acid) from 2 to 5. It was found that the reaction rate
increased with increasing reaction temperature and the equilibrium conversions
increased from 0.93 to 0.97 by increasing *0B from 2 to 5 at 513.15 K and 100 bar.
The reaction rate and the time to reach the equilibrium conversion are much faster by
using supercritical methanol. It is feasible to implement the esterification at
supercritical conditions of methanol. Additionally, the kinetic data were correlated
well with a power law model and the kinetic parameters were also determined.

A-2 實驗裝置
本實驗裝置如圖 A-1所示，基本上可分為三大部分：
1. 除氣與進料系統
2. 平衡系統
3. 取樣與組成分析系統
各主要部分說明如下：
A-2-1 除氣與進料系統
此部分係由一圓底燒瓶（2）外接一分餾管（12）、一深入瓶底之進料管、真
空泵等組成。真空泵主要是將系統抽真空用，圓底燒瓶是盛裝進料液的混合物，
且兼具除氣功能，分餾管則可減少待測物逸散，且有助於除氣與移除燒瓶內的輕
質不純物。當進料混合液經由進料管被吸入平衡釜後，殘留於瓶內的混合物之液
位必須高於進料管的入口，此時液面上之氣體，將受液面的阻隔，而不致於進入
平衡系統中。
為了使進料液能夠順利的進入平衡系統，可盡量增加除氣瓶與平衡單元間的
壓差，本研究以加熱板及電磁攪拌對圓底燒瓶隔油加熱以達到此目的，加熱的同
時也可加速移除進料液中的不凝結氣體及微量不純物之作用，液相循環泵（6）則
可用來輔助進料的輸送與液相的循環。
A-2-2 平衡系統
此一單元係以一容積約為 60 cm3的不銹鋼製的平衡釜（1），其頂蓋及底側均
鑽有大小相同的圓型孔洞，直徑為 1/8〞（RT），頂蓋四個孔分別為壓力計插孔（2
孔）、液相外循環回流之入口孔及汽相取樣之出口孔，底側的孔則為液相外循環的
出口孔。平衡釜與壓力量測器（4）均置於恆溫槽（5）內，溫度由一精密溫度計
（3）量取，本實驗所用之加熱媒體為 50 cp 之矽油。
液相循環泵除了可輔助進料液從圓底燒瓶進入平衡單元外，通路經切換後，
可與部分管路形成一個液相循環迴路，此循環系統將有助於加速汽、液兩相達到
平衡。因為是外循環的緣故，當液體回流入平衡釜之前，必需經過一段預熱管
（10），以促使回流的溫度儘速升至平衡溫度。
A-2-3 取樣與組成分析系統
此單元係由液相取樣單元與汽相取樣單元所組成，液相取樣單元以一個三通
78
A-3 量測系統與藥品
本研究分別量測下列三組雙成分混合物系統：甲醇 + 棕櫚酸甲酯、甲醇 +
油酸甲酯和甲醇 + 亞麻油酸甲酯。各種藥品的廠牌及純度如下：
1. 甲醇 (methanol)：
美國 ACROS，純度 99.9 %以上。
2. 棕櫚酸甲酯（methyl palmitate）：
日本 TCI公司，純度 97 %以上。
3. 油酸甲酯（methyl oleate）：
美國 Aldrich公司，純度在 99 %以上。
4. 亞麻油酸甲酯(methyl linoleate)：
美國 Aldrich公司，純度在 99 %以上。
上列藥品經氣相層析儀分析後，並無顯著的雜質摻在其中。
A-4 實驗程序
實驗前必須做好分析儀器的校正及藥品的配製等工作，再進行相平衡的量
測。量測步驟分述如下：
A-4-1 樣品進料操作步驟
1. 打開恆溫槽，設定平衡溫度及包覆各管路之加熱溫度。
2. 打開真空泵將實驗系統內之氣體抽出，直至系統接近真空狀態，關閉閥使除氣
／進料單元與平衡單元隔絕。
3. 將進料混合物移入除氣／進料燒瓶，以加熱板（油浴）加熱燒瓶中的混合物，
啟動電磁攪拌並抽真空，以便排出燒瓶及藥品中的不凝結氣體。此外，在除氣
時亦需以閥來控制除氣單元之真空度，降低將進料混合物抽出的機會。
4. 進料液除氣後，打開除氣燒瓶與平衡單元間的閥門使其相通，利用平衡釜與除
氣燒瓶間的壓差，將液體吸入系統內，待平衡系統與除氣燒瓶壓力接近時，打
開液體泵繼續將燒瓶內溶液饋入平衡釜中。停止進料前，除氣燒瓶內必須殘留
數毫升的液體，以便封住進料口之管口，防止不凝結氣體滲入平衡釜中。
5. 關閉除氣燒瓶與平衡單元間的閥門，並接通液相循環迴路，液相循環流量控制
在約 128 cm3/hr。
6. 待一段時間後，平衡釜內的壓力將趨於定值，記錄其壓力。此時為確保平衡釜
內無不凝結氣體，可打開抽氣裝置及所屬管線，並抽掉平衡釜內之部份氣體。

雙成分混合物系統在恆溫下的汽液平衡數據，溫度範圍從 353.15 K到 403.15 K。
由於汽相組成分析困難，因此本實驗主要量測 P-T-xi之恆溫汽液平衡數據。圖 A-2-
圖 A-4為這些混合物系統平衡壓力與組成間之關係圖，有關甲基酯純物質壓力可
從文獻中取得，由壓力／組成關係圖中，吾人可得知此系統在量測之溫度範圍內
均無共沸現象產生，並且相對於理想溶液而言，呈現正偏差。

A-6 汽液相平衡之計算
一般用於汽液相平衡的計算有兩種方法，分別為法與法。高壓下的系
統，單模式法較為適用；相對的，雙模式法對於關聯低壓下的系統較為準確。因
此，本研究所量測之數據均採用法關聯。另外，本研究所量測之系統因平衡壓
力皆為中低壓狀態，故汽相需要使用保留兩項之維里方程式(two-term virial
equation)來描述其非理想度，而其中之第二維里係數則使用 Hayden and O'Connell
模式(1975)來估算，酯類之締和參數 ij均為 0；液相成分的活性係數則分別使用
NRTL-HOC (Renon and Prausznitz, 1968)、UNIQUAC-HOC (Abrams and Prausnitz,
1975)，以及Wilson-HOC (Wilson, 1964)模式計算。
A-6-1 實驗數據之關聯
根據相平衡關係式，當系統達汽液平衡時，各成分在兩相的逸壓必須相等，
即︰
L
iiiii fxPyˆ
0  （A-1）
因本研究的混合物系統均在中低壓的條件下，所以上式可以改寫為
satsat
iPiixiPiyi  
ˆ （A-2）
式中 iˆ為汽相中成分 i 的逸壓係數。在實驗的條件範圍，汽相的非理想性不可忽

會議時間地點 Oct. 1-3, 2011; Athens, Greece
會議名稱 Thermodynamics 2011
發表論文題目
Elisabeth Widowati, Ming-Jer Lee,“PVT properties for binary mixtures of
1-methyl-1-propylpiperidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide with anisole
or acetophenone at pressures up to 50 MPa.”
一、參加會議經過
本屆之 Thermodynamics 2011在希臘雅典舉行，此國際會議為 National Center for
Scientific Research “Demokritos”, Greece主辦，為熱力學領域重要的國際會議之一。會議
中本研究室提出一篇海報論文，題目為 PVT properties for binary mixtures of 1-methyl-1-
propylpiperidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide with anisole or acetophenone at
pressures up to 50 MPa，此篇論文為此一國科會專題研究計畫的成果之一。會議期間除了
在大會指定的時間內，於海報張貼區與來自各國專業人士進行討論外，其他時間則選擇
有興趣的主題，聽取口頭報告，並提出問題相互討論。在這幾天與與會人士的互動中，
對熱力學研究領域的最新發展趨勢，有更進一步的體悟，可說獲益良多。
二、與會心得
從大會安排的專題演講中，對幾個主要國家在離子溶液之基礎與應用研究的近來發
展，有深入的瞭解，尤其對歐洲國家的研究基礎雄厚，研究內涵高，印象頗為深刻；日
本與韓國在熱物性質的研究也非常投入，尤其是產業界挹注於研究的經費相當可觀，並
結合學術界的研究經驗與技術能力，嘗試將離子溶液與超臨界流體技術等轉移至產業
界。相對而言，台灣雖然在學術研究方面尚佳，但是產業界的參與仍顯不足，也造成學
術研究與技術應用不易相互結合，這是台灣未來宜改進的地方。
會中與來自歐洲、美國、印度、日本、韓國、中國等的學者交換有關離子溶液與超
臨界流體相平衡等的研究心得，他們對於論文中所提出之高壓密度衡量測裝置非常感興
趣。未來本研究室除了將繼續提昇此實驗裝置的性能外，也將持續投注於離子溶液的基
礎物性的研究。
近年來綠色溶劑與綠色化學相關物質之物性的基礎研究儼然已成為熱力學研究領域
的重點，各國競相投入這些主題的研究，結合基礎物性與綠色新製程技術的研發，將日
益受到重視，在國際之科研競賽中，台灣尤須加緊努力。
