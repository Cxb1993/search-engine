global optimization method which called 
simulated annealing (SA) [4]. By using 
Metropolis criterion [5], the higher energy 
state can be accepted with certain condition. 
The method was successfully applied on 
solving many optimization problems. 
 
We propose the simulated annealing to 
optimize time-velocity pair combination.

(a) Automated Velocity Picking By 
Simulated Annealing 
 
 
 Fig. 1. System overview. 
 
Fig. 1 shows the proposed system of 
velocity picking. Each point on a semblance 
image has a unique pair of velocity and time. 
First, we use peak-climbing clustering with 
size 3x3 to identify these local peak points. 
Moreover, from these local peak points, we 
only choose a certain number of points with 
higher semblance value. After that, we 
arrange the points with the increasing order 
of time and velocity. We use a bit string S 
with length n to represent the peak string 
encoding. The string S = {𝑥1, 𝑥2, 𝑥3, … ,
𝑥𝑛−1, 𝑥𝑛} represents a possible combination 
of these candidate points. Each 𝑥𝑖  has a bit 
value in string S. The bit value 1 means that 
the candidate point is picked; otherwise the 
candidate point is not picked. Since that, a 
bit string S with length n has 2𝑛 possible 
combinations. In S, the points with bit value 
with 1 are linked as a polyline. 
 
We use two constrains to restrict the 
interval velocity and velocity slope in a 
candidate peak point combination. The 
internal velocity and velocity slope are 
defined as follows: 
 
Interval velocity: 
 
𝑉𝐼 𝑛 = �𝑡0,𝑛∗𝑣𝑠,𝑛2 −𝑡0,𝑛−1∗𝑣𝑠,𝑛−12𝑡0,𝑛−𝑡0,𝑛−1       (1) 
 
Velocity slope: 
 
𝑉𝑆𝑛−1,𝑛  = 𝑉𝑠,𝑛−𝑉𝑠,𝑛−1𝑡0,𝑛−𝑡0,𝑛−1            (2) 
 
Where  𝑡0,𝑛 is the two-way time of layer n, 
𝑡0,𝑛−1 is the two-way time of layer n-1, 𝑣𝑠,𝑛2  
is the staking velocity of layer n, 𝑣𝑠,𝑛−12  is 
the staking velocity of layer n-1 and 
𝑉𝑆𝑛−1,𝑛  represents the velocity slope 
between layer n and layer n-1. The two 
constrains are the penalty and shown in (3) 
and (4). 
 
𝛿(𝑉𝐼 𝑛) =
�1, 𝑖𝑓  𝑉𝐼 𝑛 >  VI(max) 𝑜𝑟 𝑉𝐼 𝑛 <  VI(min) 0                                      𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒       (3) 
 
δ�𝑉𝑆𝑛−1,𝑛� = � 1, 𝑖𝑓 𝑉𝑆𝑛−1,𝑛 > 𝑉𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥                𝑜𝑟 𝑉𝑆𝑛−1,𝑛 < 𝑉𝑆𝑚𝑖𝑛  0                                    𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒  (4) 
 
where VI(max), VI(min), 𝑉𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥, 𝑉𝑆𝑚𝑖𝑛are 
the predefined ranges for the two constraints. 
According to equation (1), (2), (3), and (4), 
we calculate the two constraints between 
every two adjacent picked points in string S. 
With the interval velocity constraint and the 
velocity slope constraint, the number of the 
violation of the two constraints would affect 
the picked string.

Because there is water layer in Nankai 
data, the two-way travel time is 
approximately 6 sec, we only perform 
picking between 5.5 sec and 11 sec. Here we 
apply the proposed  velocity picking 
system to the CMP 933 of Nankai data. Fig.

Thus, the red color is the higher energy. In

(2) 討論: 
 
We propose a system that adopts the SA 
algorithm to find an optimal time-velocity 
pair combination. Also we use two 
constrains, interval velocity and velocity 
slope, as the penalty in SA. Since the SA 
picking result is close to human picking 
result, the proposed method is feasible.  
The system can be applied to other real 
seismic data in the future. Also the 
determination of the parameter setting is the 
future work.

ABSTRACT 
 
We use three global optimization methods in the pattern 
parameter detection system, including simulated annealing 
(SA), fast simulated annealing (FSA) and very fast 
simulated annealing (VFSA). The sequential pattern 
parameter detection system can detect three types of patterns 
that include the lines, hyperbolas and ellipses in image. We 
use steps in the parameter detection for reducing the 
computation and getting fast convergence. This system has 
the capability of searching pattern parameter vectors with 
global minimal distance between the patterns and the image 
data. After the system is successful in image pattern 
detection, we apply it to detect the parameters of the 
hyperbolic patterns on real one-shot seismogram and 
seismic common depth point (CDP) gather data. This 
procedure provides an automatic velocity analysis method 
and improves the seismic interpretation and further seismic 
data processing. 
 
Index Terms—simulated annealing, fast simulated 
annealing, very fast simulated annealing, common depth 
point(CDP), velocity analysis. 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
A one-shot seismogram consists of line pattern of direct 
wave and hyperbolic pattern of reflection wave [1]-[3]. 
There are hyperbolic patterns on seismic CDP gathers [4]. In 
1985, Huang et al. had applied Hough transform (HT) to 
detect hyperbolic pattern of reflection wave [5]. In 2002, 
Hough transform neural network (HTNN) was proposed to 
detect lines, circles, and ellipses, but it did not detect 
hyperbolas [6]. In 2006, Huang et al. adopted HTNN to 
detect lines of direct wave and hyperbola of reflection wave 
in a one-shot seismogram [7]. But the gradient descent 
method in HTNN had local minimum problem. In 2009, 
Huang and Chou detect CDP gathers by simulated annealing 
algorithm [8]. 
In 1983, Kirkpatrick et al. proposed SA [9]. It is a global 
optimization algorithm. The key of the algorithm to reach 
the global minimum is in conditionally accepting higher-
energy states by Metropolis criterion [10]. Harold Szu and 
Ralph Hartley proposed the FSA in 1987 [11]. Lester Ingber 
proposed the VFSA in 1989 [12]-[13].  Both of them have 
faster convergence than SA. 
We use three global optimization methods in the seismic 
pattern detection system. The seismic pattern detection 
system can detect line pattern of direct wave and hyperbolic 
pattern of reflection wave on real one-shot seismogram. We 
also apply it to detect the parameters of the hyperbolic 
patterns on seismic common depth point (CDP) gather data. 
 
2. METHOD PROPOSED: SEISMIC PATTERN 
DETECTION SYSTEM 
 
2.1. Parametric patterns 
 
We propose the seismic pattern detection system in Fig. 1. 
First, we preprocess the seismic data by thresholding for 
input seismic data. It takes the N data as the input from the 
preprocessed image, then through the seismic pattern 
detection system to detect a set of parameter vectors of K 
patterns. After convergence, patterns are recovered from the 
detected parameter vectors.

where (mx, my) is the center, a and b are the shape 
parameters, θ is the rotation angle and  f is the size of the 
pattern.  
In vector form, a parameter vector p = [mx, my, a, b, θ, f]T 
represents a pattern. For the kth pattern, pK = [mk,x, mk,y, ak, bk, 
θk, fk]T, and for all K patterns, the matrix P = [p1, p2, …, pK] 
represents all K patterns. When (a > 0, b < 0, and f ≠ 0) or (a 
< 0, b > 0, and f ≠ 0) the graph is a hyperbola. 
 
2.2. System error 
 
For the error or energy of the system, we define the distance 
from a point xi = [xi, yi]T to the kth pattern.

We obtain seismic data from Seismic Unix System [4]. The 
real data in Fig. 2(a) is at Canadian Artic. It has 48 traces 
and 3,100 samples per trace with sampling interval 0.002 
seconds. The seismogram passes through the preprocessing 
that includes envelope processing, peak detection, and 
thresholding. We choose points with t < 1.4 seconds, which 
includes points from direct wave, first layer reflection wave, 
and second layer reflection wave as in Fig. 2(b). Fig. 2(b) is 
the input to the seismic pattern detection system. Fig.3, Fig. 
4 and Fig. 5 are the detection results by SA, FSA and VFSA.

3.2. Experiments on CDP gather and velocity analysis  
 
First, we built a 5 layer earth model; each layer has different 
interval velocity. Then we obtain the CDP gather from 40 
shot records. Second, we detect the parameters of hyperbolic 
pattern on the CDP gather, as shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. 
The parameters are used to calculate the root-mean-squared 
velocity Vrms. Finally, we use the Vrms to do the NMO 
correction and stacking. After NMO and stacking, each CDP 
gather become a trace. We collect the total traces to stack 
the seismic signal, as shown in Fig. 8. Fig 8(a) is the stacked 
seismic signal by the conventional VSPEC method. Fig 8(b), 
Fig 8(c) and Fig 8(d) are the stacked seismic signal by SA, 
FSA and VFSA.
