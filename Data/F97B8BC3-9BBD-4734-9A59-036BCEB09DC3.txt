INTRODUCTION 
Wetting is an interfacial phenomenon 
describing the condition of how liquid 
behaves as it contacts with a solid surface. 
To understand nanoscale wetting 
phenomena is useful to many areas, e.g. 
microfluidic devices [1, 2], bio-NEMS 
(Nano-Electro-Mechanical-Systems) [3] 
and membrane channels [4]. Wettability of a 
surface can be influenced by a number of 
factors such properties of and interactions 
between liquid and solid, surface roughness, 
pressure, and temperature. Among them, the 
surface roughness is most noteworthy in 
analysis of the surface wettability 
characteristics. Surface roughness can be 
artificially fabricated, formed by surface 
absorption of macromolecule, or of 
molecular level with surface atomistic 
layout. The surface elements could be of 
length scales from order of Angstroms to 
microns [5]. Bocquet and Barrat [6] 
reviewed the slippage of flow past solid at 
different length scales. As to the roughness 
of molecular scale, study of crystal plane 
effects on nanofluidics in our recent work 
[7] is a most typical example. The 
topographical surface may substantially 
change the wettability such as 
hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity. Extrand et al. 
[8] study superwetting of structured 
surfaces both experimentally and 
theoretically.  Voronov et al. [9] reviewed 
the characteristics of hydrophobicity and 
the relation with the slip length. Krupenkin 
et al. [10] demonstrated a dynamic 
electrical control of wetting behavior on 
nanostructured sufaces. McHale et al. [11] 
studied the superwetting droplets on 
surfaces having lithographically produced 
pillars. For electroosmotic flow, a molecular 
dynamics study [12] demonstrated that the 
molecular-scaled periodic roughness 
influences electric double layer remarkably.  
Numerous molecular dynamics 
simulations (MDS) have been performed on 
the subject of wettability or contact angle at 
solid-water interface. Bocquet and Barrat 
[13] demonstrated that the boundary 
condition drastically changes when the 
contact angle is large enough. Werder et al. 
employed MDS to explore the contact angles 
of water droplet confined inside a carbon 
nanotube [14] and on graphite surface and 
determined the solid-liquid interaction 
energy scale ( coε ) and length scale( coσ ) [15]. 
Yang et al. [16, 17] adopted hydrocarbons 
polymer structure to examine the contact 
angle on superhydrophobic surfaces. Their 
results revealed that the contact angle is 
significantly influenced by the 
root-mean-square roughness surface 
amplitude but almost irrelevant to the 
period of the roughness elements. Servantie 
and Müller [18] studied the rolling and 
sliding motion of droplets on roughened 
substrate. By using MD simulation, Huang 
et al. [19] investigated slippage of water at 
various hydrophobic surfaces. They 
proposed a quasi-universal relationship 
between contact angle and slip length. Chai 
et al. [20] studied the wetting of water on 
amorphous silica surface. 
Two models, Wenzel and Cassie, are 
used to explain the increase of contact angle 
with the presence of the surface 
microstructure. In the Wenzel model, the 
microstructure is regarded as a mechanism 
for increasing liquid-solid interface area 
and thus the effective free energy, which 
raises the contact angle. On the other hand, 
Cassie model attributes the increase in 
contact angle to the gas trapped in the 
cavities of surface microstructure at the 
solid-liquid interface. Quéré [21,22] 
reviewed effects of surface roughness on 
the wettability, especially the apparent 
contact angle and the contact angle 
hysteresis. Dorrer and Rühe [23] discuss the 
transition from Wenzel state to Cassie state 
through condensation. 
In the above brief introduction of the 
background, we can find that there are 
numerous interesting issues in this area 
worthwhile further investigation. Water is 
the most common liquid in nature and is the 
most important fluid in scientific and 
engineering applications [24]. Furthermore, 
silicon (Si) is a very important material in 
micro/nano fabrications. In the present study, 
we take water droplet on silicon surface as 
the model to investigate influences of 
surface morphology on contact angle at 
various conditions. Effects of surface lattice 
and the artificial roughness elements are 
both studied.

Figure 1(a) shows the calculations 
of contact angle on substrate Si(100). The 
value of contact angle is the angle 
between the solid surface base line and 
the tangent to the droplet profile on 
substrate, where the base line is defined 
as the position of 0.5σ  above the most 
upper level of solid atoms and the 
circular form is fitted by particular 
density profile. An inspection of the 
density contours indicates that the 
contour shapes and contact angles are not 
significantly change for a liquid density 
range of 0.35~0.85 The density data 
within 0.45~0.65 are employed to 
calculate the contact angle in present 
study. 
In general, the shape of a droplet is 
approximated as a part of sphere. The 
droplet lies on x y−  plane. However, in 
the case of long-period microstructure, 
there may be an anisotropic effect in 
radial direction on x-y plan. To avoid the 
anisotropy, the snapshot distribution of 
fluid particle number per unit area x yΔ Δ  
with 1.5x y σΔ = Δ =  and time step 0.25ns. 
The contours of dimensionless number of 
water molecule, , are 
used to measure the isotropy degree. The 
axis is the distance from the center of 
circle to the contour ; and 
the center of circle is defined as the mass 
center of droplet on xy-plane. The profile 
of the droplet is approximately regarded 
as a sphere when the radius error less 
than a critical value:  where 
radius error, , is set as:

max min( ) Br r r−  and the critical value, 
, is set as 0.34. The value of 0.34 
comes from 
,r cerr
min min min min( 2 ) [( 2 ) / 2]r r r r− + , in which 
min max(Br r r ) / 2≈ +  and the critical value 
for minimum and maximum radius is set 
as: min, max,2 cr r≈ c . Figure 1(b) shows a 
typical projection of droplet geometry 
onto xy-plane for examining the 
deviation of the shape from a sphere. The 
anisotropic results limit the investigation 
for long microstructure period effects. In 
the present study, it is found that the 
anisotropy of the droplet geometry in 
xy-plane appears at conditions such as 
longer period of microstructure, smaller 
fluid number, higher number-density for 
every single solid level, and stronger 
wall-fluid interaction energy.  
2.2 Solid Surface Models

Si(100) and Si(110) are employed as 
models in the present MD simulations.

A. Contact angle of water droplets 
on silicon surface without 
microstructure 
To examine the influences of the 
wall-fluid interaction energy on the 
contact angle, two energy levels, 
/ 2.wf 0ε ε = and 1.6, are adopted in the 
simulations, in which / 2.0wfε ε =  is 
one used in the previous study by Qiao 
and Aluru [27]. Surface orientations 
Si(111), Si(100) and Si(110) are 
studied. Molecular dynamics 
predictions in Fig. 4 show that the 
variations of contact angle θ  with 
base radius 1Br σ −  of the droplet. In the 
cases of some simulations, contact 
angle θ  reduces with the increase in 
size of the droplet.

B. Effects of microstructure on 
contact angle  
concluded that the inverse square of 
the depletion width δ  has a linear 
dependence with cosine of the contact 
angle. However, we found the different 
contact angle with almost consistent 
depletion layer width, 
Figure 6 shows snapshots of a 
water droplet on silicon substrate 
without and with microstructure of 
artificial roughness array. From the 
resultant droplet profiles, it  can be 
observed that the change of wettability 
due to the presence of the 
microstructure. Microstructures with 
various amplitudes and periods on 
three surface lattices are considered in 
this section to explore the contact 
angles of water droplet on a silicon 
substrate of various surface 
morphologies. The details of model 
parameters of the cases studied are 
summarized in Table 1. 
0.22nmδ ≈  as 
shown in figure 5 in this study. As 
shown in inset of figure 4, the contact 
angle not only effected by the 
depletion width but also influenced by 
the layering density of fluid. Three 
different surface orientation of Si(111), 
Si(100) and Si(110) has nearly the 
same depletion width, therefore the 
higher layering effect which is caused 
by smoother atomic surface has higher 
probability of solid-fluid momentum 
exchange and enhance the 
hydrophilicity. In this situation, 
although the smoother surface may has 
larger slip length and layering 
phenomena as the conclusions of 
previous studies [7, 30], the 
hydrophobicity has a reverse relation 
with surface atomic roughness. 
To investigate weather the gas trapped 
in the cavities at the wall-fluid 
interface, a coarse average fluid 
number density under the wall-fluid 
interface base line is defined, i.e. 
3
,cav f cav cavN V
3ρ σ −= σ ,  where 
,f cavN is ensemble average of fluid 
number inside the cavity and V
Because the hydrogen bond is 
weaker than ionic bonds but stronger 
than van der Waals interaction, the 
density layering effects variation 
caused by different wall-fluid 
interactive energy, 
3
cavσ −  
is the volume of the cavity. Since the 
solid wall is composed of soft 
molecules, the exact location of 
wall-fluid interface is not clearly 
defined and in turn the volume of the 
cavity is hard to calculate precisely. 
Herein the cavity volume is estimated 
as a half of the volume between the 
base line and the topmost level of 
cavity bottom. 
/ 2.wf 0ε ε =  and 
/ 1.wf 6ε ε = ,  change the hydrogen bond 
distribution little in present 
simulations. It is interesting to note 
that the layering or fluctuating profiles 
of the number density of water 
molecules, 3ρσ  and the hydrogen 
bond,  have a phase difference. 
The ordering effect of fluid layer 
decreases the hydrogen bonds because 
it limits the both translational and 
rotational movement of water 
molecule. On the other hand, the 
existence of hydrogen bonds intends to 
reduce the fluid laying phenomena 
near the wall-fluid interface. 
Therefore, the number of hydrogen 
bond and layering density distribution 
can be considered as important 
wettability characteristics in the 
wall-fluid interface.

Fig. 12 The density distribution contour for maximum and minimum contact angle 
with relative longer period of microstructure. The figure (a), (b),(c) are 
corresponded to figure 9(a), 9(b) and 10(a), respectively. 
 
Although it has been well-known 
that the surface microstructure may 
lead to the so-called “lotus leaf effect” 
[22], how the surface microstructure 
affects the wettability is still  an open 
issue [32]. To illustrate the qualitative 
trends of the θ  and 3cavρ σ  versus 
/ Brλ  curves for three different surface 
orientations for Si(111) Si(100) and 
Si(110), an schematic diagram is plot 
in figure 13. Basically, the θ - / Brλ  
relations for the three surface lattice 
structures have very similar 
qualitative trends. Without surface 
modification ( / Brλ =0), the 
hydrophobic characteristics based on 
contact angles of the three surface are 
in the order of 
Si(100)>Si(110)>Si(111). The common 
features of the θ - / Brλ  curves present 
that the contact angle first increases 
with / Brλ ,  after reaches a maximum it  
drops to a local minimum and then 
ascends again.  The behaviors of 
3
cavρ σ ~ / Brλ  are similar but exist 
somewhat different from the 
predictions for Si(100). The 
distributions of 3cavρ σ  fixed at a very 
low level and then increasing with 
/ Brλ  ascend, finally maintained about 
a high level beyond a longer / Brλ .  
 13
enhance the hydrophobility. 
 
B.2 The wettability influenced by the 
amplitude of microstructure 
Fig. 14 (a) is contact angle 
(upper), cavities density (lower) 
versus amplitude of microstructure 
under Si(111) and / 1.6wfε ε =  
condition. This figure shows the 
existence of air trapped inside the 
cavities corresponding lower contact 
angle under the period of 
microstructure 3σ .  When period equal 
to 3σ ,  water molecular hard to excess 
into cavity no matter the cavity 
amplitude getting deeper or not. When 
the period increasing to 6σ ,  the 
deeper the cavity the less water 
molecule accumulated into cavities 
except the lowest amplitude, 2pA σ= .  
Contact angle with amplitude 3pA σ>  
is maintained about  ,  no 
significant change whether trapped gas 
formation.

Figure 14(b) is under similar 
conditions with figure 13(a) except for 
different surface lattice Si(100) and 
wall-fluid interaction energy 
/ 2.wf 0ε ε = .  When Period equal 
to 2 ,4pA σ σ= ,  the behavior of contact 
angle and density inside cavities 
changing with cavity amplitude is 
similar to the results of Si(111) shown 
in figure 12(a). When the period of 
microstructure increasing to 8pA σ= , 
we found the trend of density inside 
cavities is proportional to amplitude of 
cavities. 
 
B.3 Effects of wall-fluid interaction 
energy /wfε ε  
One of methods to change the 
hydrophobicity of a surface in 
simulations is tuning the wall-fluid 
interaction energy and keeping the 
wall-fluid interaction distance 
constant [9, 30]. To investigate the 
effects of wall-fluid interaction energy 
under artificial microstructure, we test 
the contact angle of water droplet on 
surface of Si(111) lattice with the 
 15
substrate surface.  We explain the 
wettiabili ty variety by comparing the 
influence of the opposite surface charge 
on average hydrogen bond number of 
droplets,  HBn  and density distribution, 
3
fρ σ  which affects the interfacial  
properties.  With the static electric force 
applied by the surface charge, the 
wettiabili ty influenced by various effects 
including the average hydrogen bond 
effect,  density layering effect and solute 
distribution.

CONCLUDING REMARKS 
In the present study of molecular 
dynamics simulations, wettability 
characteristics of water droplet on the 
Si(111) Si(100) and Si(110) surfaces 
without and with microstructures have 
been analyzed. Based on the present 
analysis, the following conclusions 
can be drawn.  
(1) The almost consistent 
depletion layer width comes with 
different contact angles result of 
various surface orientations without 
roughness in this study. The result 
reveals that the contact angle not only 
effected by the depletion width but 
also influenced by the layering density 
of fluid. The higher layering effect 
caused by smoother atomic surface has 
higher probability of solid-fluid 
momentum exchange and enhance the 
hydrophilicity. In this situation, 
although the smoother surface may has 
more hydrophilicity. The droplet 
density layering phenomenon near 
interface is influenced by surface 
orientation and wall-fluid interaction 
energy both with and without 
microstructure. The hydrophilicity is 
enhanced with the density layering 
effects under surface without 
microstructure; by contrast, the 
hydrophobility is increased by 
inconsistent density layering effects 
under surface with microstructure.  
(2) For the surface microstructure 
of shorter period, the water density in 
cavities is lower and some amount of 
vapor is also contained. It  can be 
inferred that the surface roughness 
effect is more likely the proposition of 
the Cassie model. As the period 
increases to approach the radius of the 
solid-liquid interface, the situation is 
more appropriate to be described by 
the Wenzel model. 
(3) The hydrophobicity may 
enhanced by various effects with 
microstructure in nanoscale. One is the 
vapor contained inside wall-fluid 
interface to reduce the wall-fluid 
energy exchange. Another effect 
occurred as fluid layering reduced by 
hydrogen bonds. In some cases of long 
period and deeper amplitude, higher 
density of hydrogen bonds expands the 
water volume and forms abrupt 
distribution of density layer profiles.
