the early 1980s. Soon after, this explosion of  use was expanded into various industries 
such as automotive, semiconductor and IC assembly manufacturing, to determine 
production quality in order to meet stringent customers’ specifications. Those indices 
quantify process performance by taking into consideration the process location, process 
variation, and manufacturing specifications, which reflect process consistency, process 
accuracy, process yield, and process loss. Four basic capability indices have been defined 
in the following (see Kane (1986), Chan et al. (1988), Pearn et al. (1992)):

where USL  and LSL  are the upper and lower specification limits, T  is the target 
value, μ  and σ  are the process mean and the standard deviation of  the characteristic, 
respectively. In the literature, several authors have promoted the use of  various process 
capability indices and examined their associated properties with different degrees of  
completeness. Examples include Kushler and Hurley (1992), Rodriguez (1992), Kotz and 
Johnson (1993), Vännman and Kotz (1995), Bothe (1997), Spiring (1997), Kotz and 
Lovelace (1998), Palmer and Tsui (1999), Pearn and Shu (2003), Vännman and Hubele 
(2003), and references therein. Kotz and Johnson (2002) presented a compact survey for 
the development of  process capability indices with interpretations and comments on 
some 170 publications appeared during 1992-2000. Spiring et al. (2003) consolidated the 
research findings in the field of  process capability during6 1990-2002. 
The assessment of  process capability appears to be easy and straightforward to apply. 
But, some assumptions must be met before applying the capability indices. Those 
assumptions include (a) the process under investigation must be free from any special or 
assignable causes (i.e., in-control), (b) the process characteristics must follow normal 
distributions, and (c) the observed values of  quality characteristics must be statistically 
independent. If  the process is out of  control in the early stages, it will be unreliable and 
meaningless to estimate process capability. Porter and Oakland (1991) pointed out that 
two conditions making process capability assessment difficult are: ensuring stability of  
the mean and standard deviation, and absence of  special causes. It is also assumed that 
observations are statistically independent, which is not always the case in reality. 
Processes with uncontrollable but acceptable trend, however, are common in practice. 
Tool wear is an example of  common assignable causes inducing autocorrelation, which is 
physically unavoidable. Current practices in assessing process capability in the presence 
of  assignable cause include various techniques. Some approaches attempt to remove the 
variability associated with the systematic cause. For examples, Montgomery (1985) 
suggested to fit the first order autoregressive model to the correlated data. Yang and 
Hancock (1990) recommended that in computing the pC  index, the unbiased estimator 
of  σ  can be obtained as σ ρ− 1/2/(1 ) , where ρ  is defined as the average correction 
factor. Time series modeling to trended data is also suggested by Alwan and Roberts 
(1988), who recommend using residuals in monitoring the process. Furthermore, others 
make the general assumption of  linear degradation in the tool. For instance, the 
 4
over time. Typically, deviations from the target value are due to easily determined 
assignable causes, such as shift-to-shift changes, differences in raw material batches, 
environmental factors, etc. Wallgren (1996) has also studied the properties and 
implications of  pmC  when consecutive measurements are observations of  dependent 
variables resulting from a Markov process in discrete time. This occurs when consecutive 
measurements from a process are serially corrected. He developed an augmentation of  
pmC , pmrC  for this situation, based on the first order autoregressive model (AR(1)). 
The most general case discussed assumes only a reasonable predictable recurring 
pattern with known upper and lower specification limits, target value and the existence of  
a tool wear problem. Figure 1 illustrates a general relationship that may occur when a 
tool wear problem exists. The process specifications (i.e. USL , LSL  and T ), the 
starting, stopping, tool replacement times (i.e. 0t , 1t , 2t , 3t ), and the process output 
have been included in Figure 1. The tool wear is depicted in a non-linear, increasing 
fashion but could be any reasonably consistent recurring pattern (including linear 
degradation). The change times may represent chronological time but are more likely to 
represent production qualities. The process illustrated in Figure 1 depicts a systematic 
tool wear problem with non-linear cycles over time/production. Similar to assessing 
variation in any process all sources of  variation must be examined when considering tool 
wear. The cycles should be noted that the methodology presented here is only reactionary 
in its approach to dealing with the problem. To become pro-active in the area of  tool wear, 
steps should be taken to eliminate variation due to an assignable cause. In a process 
exhibiting a tool wear problem, the traditional measure of  process capability index pkC  
is affected by tool wear slope (see Figure 2). Thus, such measure is invalid since it fails to 
acknowledge that portions of  the overall variation is due to assignable causes.

3. Statistical Properties of the Estimated Cpk  under Tool Wear 
In this section, we introduce a modification of  pkC  index for the dynamic process 
under tool wear condition. Subsequently, we obtain an explicit form of  the exact 
cumulative distribution function for the dynamic estimator to measure the fraction of  
defectives. The cumulative distribution function can be expressed in terms of  a mixture of  
the chi-square distribution and the normal distribution. We then obtain the r-th moment, 
and the first two moments (mean and variance) of  the estimated pkC  for the dynamic 
process.

where n  denotes the subgroup sample size, and 
aitX  represents the i th value of  the 
quality characteristic in the sampling period at . The proposed sampling scheme is similar 
to those schemes used in monitoring a process for control charting procedures. The 
general format would be to gather k  subgroups of  size n  from each cycle (e.g., the 
period form 0t  to 1t  (in Figure 1) over the lifetime of  the tool. The value of  k  is 
unique to each process, and may change from cycle to cycle within a process. On the 
other hand, sample size less than five (i.e., < 5n ) one must be cautious, while larger 
samples (e.g. > 30n ) may also pose a problem. The optimal sample size for assessing 
process capability in the presence of  systematic assignable cause varies for each process 
considered (see Spiring (1991) for more details).

The process is called capable if  it produces low fraction defective. Otherwise the 
process is not capable. We define the test φ * ( )x , the decision making rule, as the 
following: φ =* ( ) 1x  if  > 0ˆ pkC c , and φ =* ( ) 0x otherwise. Thus, the test φ *  rejects the 
null hypothesis 0H  ( ≤pkC C ) if  α>ˆ pkC c , with type I error αα α=( )c , the chance of  
incorrectly concluding an incapable process ( ≤pkC C ) as capable ( >pkC C ). Based on the 
CDF of  ˆ pkC  expressed in (6), given values of  capability requirement C  (i.e. the 
expected product’s fraction of  defectives), the parameterξ , sample size n , and riskα , the 
critical value αc  can be obtained by solving the equation α α≥ = =ˆ( | )pk pkP C c C C  using 
available numerical integration methods. That is,

It should be noted, particularly, that equation (12) is an even function of  ξ .  Thus, 
for both ξ ξ= 0  and ξ ξ= − 0  we may obtain the same critical value αc . However, from 
the expression (12) the distribution characteristic parameter ξ μ σ= −( )/M  is usually 
unknown, which has to be estimated in real applications, naturally by substituting μ  
and σ  by the sample mean X  and the sample variance == − −∑2 21( ) /( 1)n iiS X X n . To 
eliminate the need for estimating the parameter ξ , we examine the behavior of  the 
critical values αc  against the parameter ξ =0(0.05)3.00. We further perform extensive 
calculations to obtain the critical values αc  for ξ = 0(0.05)3.00 , n = 5(5)50, pkC = 
0.5(0.5)2.0 with risk α = 0.05. Note that the parameter values we investigated, 
ξ = 0(0.05)3.00 , cover a sufficiently wide range of  applications with process capability 
analysis.  The results indicate that (i) the critical values αc  is increasing in ξ , and is 
decreasing in n , (ii) the critical values αc  obtains its maximum at ξ = 1.00  in all cases 
with accuracy up to −310 .  Hence, for practical purpose we may solve equation (12) with 
ξ = 1.00  to obtain the required critical values αc  for given pkC , n , andα , without 
having to further estimate the parameter ξ .  Thus, the risk α  can be ensured, and the 
decisions made based on such approach are indeed more reliable.  Figures 3(a)-(d) plot 
the curves of  the critical value αc  versus the parameter ξ = 0(0.05)3.00, n = 5, 10, 20, 
30 with type I error α = 0.05 for four levels of  pkC  = 0.50, 1.00, 1.50 and 2.00, 
respectively. 
For users’ convenience in applying our proposed procedure, we tabulate the critical 
values of ˆ pkC  for various values of α = 0.01 and 0.05 with n = 5(5)30 in Table 1 for 
commonly recommended minimum capability requirement C = 1.00, 1.33, 1.67 and 2.00. For 
example, if C = 1.00 is the minimum capability requirement, then for α  = 0.05, with sample 
size n  = 15 we can find αc  = 1.517 from Table 1. That is, as the estimated process 
capability drops below the critical value of ˆ pkC , the practitioner should stop the process and 
reset the tool because there is an evidence to consider that the process is nearing the end of its 
ability to produce satisfactory product. If the values of ˆ pkC  greater than the critical value, 
then the process is considered capable and should be allowed to continued.

manufacturing specification limits are set to = 48.6USL  mm and = 47.6LSL  mm, 
respectively. If the characteristic data does not fall within the tolerance ( , )LSL USL , the 
component of the connecting rod is considered to nonconforming/defective, and will not 
be used to make the diesel engine of that particular model.

When the product comes out of the process, the diameter is measured and recorded. 
The collected data exhibiting tool wear consist of  100 observations arranged in ten 
subgroups of  size ten each, which displayed in Table 2. Figures 4 plots the individual 
values in the series data. It can be seen that the observations starting from a higher value 
(close to upper limit) gradually decrease to the lower limit due to tool wear. The trend 
appears to be linear in decreasing. Also, the values of the diameter of each component is 
influenced by the amount of tool wear at that instant, which is likely to be dependent on 
the condition of the tool when previous component was processed. Now, the goal is to 
maintain some minimum level of  capability at all times and to monitor/manage this 
processes under the influence of  tool wear. The lower confidence bound not only is 
essential to production yield assurance, but also can be used in capability testing for 
decision making. In fact, Boyles (1991) showed that Yield ≥ 2Φ(3Cpk) – 1, or the fraction 
of  nonconformities ≤ 2Φ(-3Cpk). Table 3 displays various values of  pkC = 1.00(0.10)2.00, 
and the corresponding maximum possible nonconformities (in PPM).  For example, if  a 
process has capability with pkC  ≥ 1, then the production yield would be at least 99.73%. 
Similarly, to achieve less than 0.544 ppm defect rate, a pkC  level of  1.67 is needed. At a 
pkC  level of  2.0, the likelihood of  a defective part drops to 2 parts per billion (ppb). 
Suppose the capability requirement for this particular model of  diesel engine was defined 
as "Capable" if  > 1.00pkC . When the measure of  process capability comes closer to the 
minimum acceptable level, the processing should be stopped and the tool should be 
replaced. Thus, applying the proposed capability measure for dynamic, the practitioners 
can monitor the process by calculating the measure of  pkC . The proposed procedure for 
a process involving tool wear is similar to those used in monitoring a process with control 
chart.

6. Conclusions 
Process capability index pkC  is an effective tool for process performance analysis 
and quality assurance. The index pkC  provides measures of  process yield. Given a fixed 
pkC  value, the production yield and fraction of  defectives can be calculated. Process 
capability can be calculated accurately if  the data contains no assignable cause variation. 
Tool wear, however, is a dominant and irremovable component in many machining 
processes, which is a systematic assignable cause. The ordinary measures of  process 
capability are inaccurate because the process data is contaminated by the assignable cause 
variation. Therefore, developing an effective method to determine optimal time for tool 
replacement becomes essential due to high product quality requirement and low 
production cost consideration. For processes with tool wear, an estimator of  pkC  is 
investigated. Closed form of  the exact sampling distribution is also derived. We showed 
that under the assumption of  normality its sampling distribution is a mixture of  the 
chi-square and the normal distributions. We implemented the derived results to developed 
a tool management procedure for assessing process capability at each time period over a 
single cycle of  the process. Critical values for various capability requirements and sample 
sizes are provided. Considering the process capability changes dynamically, a procedure 
using control chart is developed to monitor the process and find optimal tool replacement 
time to maintain the production quality.
