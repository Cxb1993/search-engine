Introduction
While the state space representation will continue to be very impor-
tant, there has been an increasing interest in working with the descriptor
systems[45] and [15]. Depending on the research area, descriptor sys-
tems have different nomenclature in different fields. Control theorists
and mathematicians call them singular systems [8][9][29][40], or some-
times they use the terminology generalized state-space systems[1][21][57].
On the other hand, numerical analysts call them differential-algebraic
equations[7][43][47], or differential equations with algebraic constraints[36].
In the circuits area, the name semistate systems is used[17].
Descriptor systems have many important features. Firstly, when
physical problems are simulated, the models often take the form of de-
scriptor systems depicting a collection of relationships between variables
of interest and some of their derivatives. This relationships may even
be generated automatically by modeling. Thus, the variables introduced
usually have a physical significance. Secondly, some physical phenomena,
like impulse, hysteresis which are important in circuit theory and physics,
cannot be treated properly in the state-space models[32][57]. Descriptor

There are many meanings of the term ”hybrid dynamical system”
(HDS), the most common of which is a dynamical system that involves
the interaction of discrete and continous dynamics. Such dynamical sys-
tems typically contain variables that take values from a continuous set
and also variables that take values from a discrete set (e.g., the set of
symbols {q1, q2, ..., qk}). This model can be used to describe accurately a
wide range of real-time industrial processes and their associated supervi-
sory control and monitoring systems. Instances of such systems include
automotive power-train systems, computer disk drives, robotic systems,
automotive engine management, high-level flexible manufacturing sys-
tems, intelligent vehicle/highway systems, sea/air traffic management,
modern spacecraft control systems, job scheduling, interconnected power
systems, and chemical processes (e.g., see [42, 34, 33]). Actually, most
dynamical systems that we have seen can be reasonably described in hy-
brid terms. Many interesting examples of hybrid dynamical systems from
various areas can be found in the introductory book of van der Schaft
and Schumacher [50]. One well-known instance of a hybrid system is a
dynamical system described by a set of ordinary differential equations
with discontinuous or multivalued right-hand sides. This mathematical
model can be used, for example, to describe various engineering systems
that contain relays, switches, and hysteresis [19, 20, 28]. Another area
that has been brought into the hybrid systems framework is the study of
sliding mode control [56].
Switched systems constitute a special class of hybrid systems. Switched
systems arise in engineering practice where several dynamical system
3
each subsystem has its own Lyapunov-like function which behaves as
usual Lyapunov function only when this subsystem is active. A common
Lyapunov-like function for all subsystems, which obviously qualifies as a
usual Lyapunov function, may not exist or be difficult to find. Therefore,
the multiple Lyapunov function technique proposed in [46, 6, 24, 61] has
proven to be a powerful and effective tool for finding such a switching
law. Many results in this direction have been available (for example, see
[18, 22]). The key point of these conditions of multiple Lyapunov func-
tion methods is the nonincreasing requirement on any Lyapunov function
over the ”switched on” time sequence of the corresponding subsystem.
However, this is usually hard to check in its full generality. Thus, in
order to apply the multiple Lyapunov function methods, connecting ad-
jacent Lyapunov functions at switching points is a commonly accepted
strategy. This can be typically achieved by choosing the switching law
according to the ”min-switching” strategy of all Lyapunov functions [34],
which is a special case of Branicky’s nonincreasing condition, but easy to
design and realize. As a result, a globally piecewise defined continuous
Lyapunov function is formed.
The L2 − gain analysis and H∞ control problems have been rarely
addressed for switched systems. As an open problem, the L2 − gain that
all linear subsystems share was put forward in [23]. The L2−induced
norm of switched linear systems composed of Hurwitz stable subsystems
was considered and a weighted gain was reached under a large dwell time
condition. Using the dwell time concept, another result of disturbance at-
tenuation for both switched linear and nonlinear systems was reported by
5
eralized Lyapunov theorem for switched descriptor systems is presented.
Necessary and sufficient conditions are given under which a switched de-
scriptor system is guaranteed to be stable and causal. We transform the
condition of asymptotical stability and impulse-freeness into the solvabil-
ity of a set of linear matrix inequalities(LMIs). (2) We study the problem
of L2 − gain for switched descriptor systems. (3) Based on the results
of (1), (2), we will discuss the state feedback H∞ control problem for
switched descriptor systems. (4) A solution to the output feedback H∞
control problem for switched descriptor systems will be given.
This report is organized as follows: In Chapter 2, we briefly review
some basic definitions and properties concerning descriptor systems and
switched systems. We also set up some notations used throughout the
report in this chapter. Chapter 3 is the main body of the report. We will
complete (1), (2), (3), and (4) described above in Chapter 3. Finally, in
Chapter 4 we will give some concluding remarks.

2.1. NOTATIONS AND DEFINITIONS
The switching sequence Σ is assumed to be minimal in the sense that
ik = i(k+1) for any k. For any j ∈M , let
Σ|j = {tj1 , tj1+1, · · · , tjn , tjn+1, · · · , ijq = j, q ∈ N}
be the sequence of switching times when the j-th subsystem is switched
on or switched off.
For a given strictly increasing sequence of times T ={t0,t1, · · · , tn, · · · },
the interval completion I(T ) is the set I(T ) = ∪j∈N [t2j, t2j+1). Let E(T )
denote the even sequence of T : E(T ) = {t0, t2, t4, · · · , }. Therefore,
E(
∑ |j) = {tj1 , tj2 , · · · , tjn , · · · , n ∈ N} is the ”switched on” times of
the j-th subsystem.
Next, we introduce the concept of matrix pencil. For an arbitrary
n × n matrix A, its eigenvalues are defined as the n roots, counting
multiplicity, of its characteristic polynominal det(λIn − A) = 0, where
In stands for the n × n identity matrix. The concept of eigenvalues of
a square matrix can be easily extended to a pair of square matrices of
the same size as follows. Suppose we are given two real (or in general
complex) n × n matrices E and A; the (ordered) pair (E,A) is said to
be regular if there exist scalars α and β (in general, α and β may be
complex even though both E and A are real) with the property that
|α|2 + |β|2 ̸= 0, such that the matrix αE − βA is invertible. It is easy
to verify that the regularity of the matrix pair (E,A) coincides with the
regularity of the matrix pencil (zE−A). Henceforth, we shall use the two
definitions interchangeably. Let α0 and β0, not both zero, be such that
the matrix α0E − β0A is noninvertible. If β0 ̸= 0, λ0 △= α0/β0 is called
a finite eigenvalue of (E,A). In this case, any nonzero vector x0 which

the deflating subspace of the matrix pair (E,A).
Definition 2.1. A subspace S of Rn (or Cn) is called a deflating subspace
of a matrix pair (E,A) if there exists a subspace T of Rn (or Cn) such
that
ES ⊂ T , AS ⊂ T ,
and
dimS = dimT .
In this case, T is called a codeflating subspace of (E,A) corresponding to
S. 
Note that If E = I, then S is A-invariant. Hence the deflating
subspace is in fact a generalization of the invariant subspace.
2.2 Elements of Descriptor Systems Theory
In this section we summarize some basic definitions and preliminary
results concerning the descriptor systems theory. Most of the materials
contained in this section are essentially taken from [58].
Consider the following linear time-invariant system
Ex˙ = Ax + Bu,
y = Cx, (2.2)
with Ex(0) ∈ ℑmE given, where E,A ∈ Rn×n, B ∈ Rn×m, C ∈ Rp×n are
constant matrices. Systems described by (2.2) with singular E are called
descriptor systems. It is easy to see, from a frequency-domain point of
11
2.2. ELEMENTS OF DESCRIPTOR SYSTEMS THEORY
Under this coordinate, the state xˆ1 and xˆ2 can be solved by
xˆ1(t) = e
A1txˆ1(0) +
∫ t

xˆ2(t) = −
k−1∑
i=0
N iB2u
(i)(t), (2.5)
where k is the index of N . The initial conditions that admit smooth
solutions are called consistent initial conditions. If the initial condition
is not consistent or the input is not sufficiently smooth, then the solution
may have impulsive behavior[15]. They are useful in simulating particular
physical phenomena. It is easy to observe, from equation (2.5), that xˆ2
will not contain any impulse behavior if N = 0. The case is preferable
for engineering purposes since the impulsive dynamics may cause system
damage.
It is not difficult to see that the finite dynamic modes are relative to
the eigenvalues of A1 or, equivalently, the eigenvalues of the pair (E,A)
defined as follows.
λ(E, A)

= {λ ∈ C | λEx = Ax, x ∈ Rn, x ̸= 0} .
Moreover, it has as many impulsive modes as rank N .
The concepts of controllability and observability for descriptor sys-
tems are introduced next. In contrast to standard state space systems,
for descriptor systems, there are several different notions of controllabil-
ity and observability. There is no unified terminology in the literature
on this issue, see [5][12][15][52][59] and references therein.
Definition 2.3. Consider the descriptor system (2.2). Suppose that the
pair (E,A) is regular. Then
13
2.2. ELEMENTS OF DESCRIPTOR SYSTEMS THEORY
3. System (2.2) is finite dynamic stabilizable and impulse controllable
if there exists a constant matrix K such that the pair (E, A+BK)
is admissible.
4. System (2.2) is finite dynamic detectable and impulse observable if
there exists a constant matrix K such that the pair (E, A+LC) is
admissible.
Similar to the state space systems, the controllability and observ-
ability of a descriptor system can be verified through some geometric
criteria.
Theorem 2.6. Consider (2.2). Suppose that (E,A) is regular, then its
Weierstrass form decomposition (2.3) is well-defined.
1. The following are equivalent:
(a) the triplet (E,A,B) is completely controllable;
(b) ℑm(λE − A) + ℑmB = Cn for all λ ∈ C and
ℑmE + ℑmB = Rn;
(c) ℑm(λI − A1) + ℑmB1 = Cq for all λ ∈ C and
ℑmN + ℑmB2 = Rn−r;
2. The following are equivalent:
(a) the triplet (E,C,A) is completely observable;
(b) Ker(λE − A)⋂KerC = {0} for all λ ∈ C and
KerE⋂KerC = {0};
(c) Ker(λI − A1)
⋂KerC1 = {0} for all λ ∈ C and
KerN ⋂KerC2 = {0};

3.1. STABILITY FOR SWITCHED DESCRIPTOR SYSTEMS
for any x(0) ∈ Rn.
Definition 3.2. Consider (2.1). Suppose {Ei, Ai} are regular for all
i = 1, 2, ...m. The system is called impulse free if there are no impulse
phenomena on the time t ∈ E(Σ|j).
Definition 3.3. A function α : R+ → R+ is called a class GK function
if it is increasing and right continuous at the origin and α(0) = 0.
With the help of class GK functions, asymptotical stability of the
switched system (2.1) can be characterized by the following lemma.
Lemma 3.4. Consider the system (2.1) with uσ
△
= 0. Suppose {Ei, Ai}
are regular for all i = 1, 2, ...m. Suppose that for each i there exists Xi
such that ATi Xi +X
T
i Ai < 0 for t ∈ [tk, tk+1). Then, the system (2.1) is
asymptotically stable if there exists a class GK functions αj satisfying
xT (tjk+1)E
TXjx(tjk+1)
−xT (tj1)ETXjx(tj1) ≤ αj(‖Ex0‖),
k ≥ 1, j = 1, 2, · · ·m
In the following, we adress the issue of how to design a switching law
to make the switched descriptor systems stable and impulse-free with
the help of the conditions given in Lemma 3.4. Suppose that we have
matrices Xi, Qij, i, j = 1, 2 · · · , m, satisfying
Qij +Qjk ≤ min{0, Qik}, ∀i, j, k. (3.2)
Then, it is easy to see that for any interger i1, i2, · · · , iq ∈ {1, 2, · · · ,m},
Qi1i2 +Qi2i3 + · · ·Qiq−1q +Qiqi1 ≤ 0. (3.3)

3.2. L2-GAIN ANALYSIS FOR SWITCHED DESCRIPTOR
SYSTEMS
Furthermore, under this condition, one switching law can be designed by
(3.7).
Remark 3.7. When m = 1, with Qij = 0 and βij = 0 for all i, j =
1, 2, ...m, all conditions (3.10), (3.11) and (3.12) trivially hold, and in
this case, (3.8) and (3.9) reduce to the well known results presented in
[39].
3.2 L2-gain analysis for switched descriptor systems
In this section, we will present an L2-gain description for switched de-
scriptor systems and then achieving L2-gain by design of switching laws.
To present the main results of this section, we need the following defini-
tions.
Definition 3.8. Consider (2.1). Suppose {Ei, Ai} are regular for all
i = 1, 2, ...m. System (2.1) is said to be dissipative with respective to
the supply rate s : U × Y → R under the switching law Σ if there exist
nonnegative functions Si : X → R+, i = 1, 2, ...m, called the storage
functions, and class GK functions αi such that for i = 1, 2, ...m, k ∈ N,
and ui satisfying
∫∞

where tk ≤ s ≤ t < tk+1.

3.2. L2-GAIN ANALYSIS FOR SWITCHED DESCRIPTOR
SYSTEMS
We are now in a position to present a necessary and sufficient condi-
tion for determining whether systems (2.1) has an L2 − gain less than γ
via the switching law (3.7).
Theorem 3.11. Consider the system (2.1). Suppose {Ei, Ai} are regular
for all i = 1, 2, ...m. Then the system (2.1) has an L2 − gain less than
γ under a switching law if and only if for all i, j ∈M there exist Xi, Qij
and constants βij such taht

Qij +Qjk −Qik ≤ 0, ∀i, j, k (3.20)
Qij +Qjk ≤ 0, ∀ i, j, k. (3.21)
Furthermore, under this condition, one switching law can be designed by
(3.7).
As L2 − gain of non-switched descriptor systems gives stability, L2 −
gain of switched descriptor systems is also expected to imply stability.
This will be shown in the following.
Corollary 3.12. Consider the system (2.1). Suppose {Ei, Ai} are regu-
lar for all i = 1, 2, ...m. If the system (2.1) has L2 − gain less than γ
under the switching law Σ, then the system (2.1) is asymptotically stable
and impulse free.
Remark 3.13. When m = 1, with Qij = 0 and βij = 0 for all i, j =
1, 2, ...m, all conditions (3.19), (3.20) and (3.21) trivially hold, and in
21
3.3. H∞ CONTROL PROBLEM FOR SWITCHED DESCRIPTOR
SYSTEMS
where x ∈ Rn is the state, and w ∈ Rm represents a set of exogenous
inputs which includes disturbances to be rejected and/or reference com-
mands to be tracked. y ∈ Rq is the measured output. u ∈ Rl is the
control input. A,B1, B2, and C2 are constant matrices with compatible
dimensions. E ∈ Rn×n and rankE = r ≤ n. The standard H∞ control
problem for switched descriptor systems consists of finding state feedback
gains F1, · · · , Fm and a switching law σ(t) such that:
1. The resulting closed-loop system is internally stable and Tzw, Here
closed-loop internal stability means that the closed-loop system is
regular and impulse-free, and that the states of G and K go to zero
from all initial values when w = 0.
2. The L2 − gain from w to y on any finite time internal is strictly
less than a prescribed positive number γ.
The system (3.22) is assumed to satisfy the following assumptions.
(A1) (Ei, Ai) is regular for all i.
(A2) (Ei, Ai, B2i) is finite dynamics stabilizable and noncasuality con-
trollable for all i.
(A3) (Ei, Ai, C2i) is finite dynamics detectable and noncausality observ-
able for all i.
We are now in a position to give our main result in this subsection,
which is summarized in the following statements.
Theorem 3.14. Consider (3.22). Suppose that assumptions (A1)-(A3)
hold. Then the state feedback H∞ control problem is solvable if and only

Ei, Ai ∈ Rn×n and rankEi ≤ n. The matrices B1i, B2i, C1i, C2i, D12i, and
D21i are constant matrices with compatible dimensions. The standard
output feedback H∞ control problem for descriptor systems consists of
finding a switching controller K of the form

where Eˆi, Aˆi ∈ Rnc×nc , Bˆi ∈ Rnc×q and Cˆi ∈ Rl×nc , and a switching law
σ(t) such that:
1. The resulting closed-loop system is internally stable and Tzw, Here
closed-loop internal stability means that the closed-loop system is
regular and impulse-free, and that the states of G and K go to zero
from all initial values when w = 0.
2. The L2 − gain from w to y on any finite time internal is strictly
less than a prescribed positive number γ.

中華民國九十九年八月十五日 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
國際控制界知名學者，所演講主題也是控制領域的重要研究方向，與會者極為踴
躍。 
 
論文發表部份，這次研討會總共發表了有關線性控制理論、非線性控制理論、複
雜系統、系統辨識與信號處理、多智能體系統、系統生物學、強健控制、可變結
構控制、可靠控制、適應控制、混成系統控制、網路控制系統、濾波器、機器人
控制、人機介面、最佳控制、神經網路、模糊控制、智慧控制、節能控制、遺傳
演算法、等論文近約千篇。 
 
筆者在這次會議中，發表一篇論文(參見附件)，探討數個具canonical form 的
非線性系統的同時H-infinity 控制問題(Simultaneous H-infinity Control for a 
Collection of nonlinear Systems in Canonical Form)，我們以control storage 
function 的技巧，證明對具canonical form 的一群非線性系統，在一些假設下， 
其同時H-infinity 控制器必然存在，且我們也找到其控制器的公式。大陸雖然
有很多學者投入研究，但同時H-infinity 控制從未有人探討過非線性的狀況。
因此大陸甚多學者與研究生對此兩篇論文均深感興趣，問了很多問題，有很深入
的討論與交流，收穫甚多。 
 
(二) 與會心得 
 
這次北京行，感受到大陸學生跟臺灣的學生相比企圖心強了很多，表達能力也普
遍比較好。而大陸因人多，所以研究的主題極為完整，不管是最新的控制理論，
或相關應用，均有很多學者與學生投入，幾乎想到的主題都有人做，這種完整性
是臺灣所欠缺的。或因人力不是那麼多，國內在一些新的研究主題上投入的研究
能量似有不足，這會造成學術上被邊緣化的危機，或許是我們該想法去克服的。
這次的研討會處處可看出主辦單位的用心，不管是議程的安排、住宿安排、用餐
的安排、機場的接送均相當妥適。雖然會場距飯店不遠，但大會仍每天由住宿飯
店均安排交通車到會場，相當便利。美中不足之處是會場大會所安排的網路相關
設施較不方便，未有明顯標示，這是國內辦大型國際研討會該注意之處。 
 
(三) 誌謝 
 
非常感謝行政院國家科學委員會的補助讓筆者參加這次研討會。與會讓筆者對相
關控制理論研究的新方向有更深入的認知，這對筆者在研究深度的提昇有實質幫
助。而跟大陸學者的交流，也給了筆者很多的收穫。期許自己能藉由此次參加研
討會所學習到的知識，在往後的學術研究上能有更新的突破，以提升國內相關領
域的國際學術名聲與能見度。

For ensuring the continuity of the obtained simultaneous

SCP) has been introduced in [13].  
 Definition 2 [13]: A CSF RRV ni →⋅ :)(  of Si satisfies the 
L2-gain SCP if for each 0>ε  there is a 1δ  and a 2δ  such 
that, if 0≠x  satisfies 1δ<x  and w satisfies 2δ<w ,

3 MAIN REAULTS 
For a single system, it has been shown in [13] that the 
existence of CSFs is a necessary and sufficient condition for 
the existence of L2-gain rendering controllers. Therefore, 
for the existence of simultaneously L2-gain rendering 
controllers for the systems in (3), the existence of CSFs for 
these systems is necessary. Next we will derive CSFs 
explicitly for the systems in (3).  
Let  
111 )( xxs = ,  
)()( 11111 xscx −=ϕ  for some 01 >c . 
Moreover, for j=2,…,n, let 
)()( 11 −−−= jjjjj xxxs ϕ ,         (6)

is positive definite and radially unbounded in x. We first 
show the existence of CSFs for the systems in (3). 
Theorem 1: Consider the systems in (3). Suppose that 
Assumptions 1 and 2 hold. Then, there exists a common 
quadratic CSF that satisfying the L2-gain SCP for all the 
systems in (3). 
Proof: Let )(ˆ)( xVKxVi ⋅= , i=1,2,…,q, where 0>K  will 
be specified later. For the i-th possible mode in (3), define 
the corresponding Hamiltonian function as

That is, for each },...,1{ qi ∈ , along the trajectories of Si,

and therefore the closed-loop systems are all internally 
stable.                      ■
