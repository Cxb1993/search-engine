1. Abstract 
La0.68Ba0.32MnO3 epilayers and 
La0.68Ba0.32MnO3/SrTiO3 (LBMO/STO) 
superlattices were grown epitaxially on STO, 
LaNiO3-coated STO and LaAlO3 (001) 
single-crystal substrates. Almost 
pseudomorphic growth of the LBMO/STO 
superlattice on an STO substrate is observed 
to a total thickness of ~1440Å. The critical 
relaxation thickness of LBMO epilayers 
depends on the lattice misfit. Above the 
critical thickness, the strain in the epilayers 
relaxes gradually rather than abruptly to an 
unstrained state. The Jahn-Teller strain in the 
LBMO lattice was experimentally estimated 
by measuring the in-plane and the 
out-of-plane x-ray diffractions. The 
modifications of magnetic and transport 
properties of manganite epilayers were 
discussed in relation to changes in the MnO6 
octahedral geometry.

2. Introduction 
The spectacular versatility of the 
observed magnetic and transport properties in 
mixed manganites, and the dependence of 
these on the structural parameters have 
opened up many expectations in the design of 
magnetic devices [1,2]. La1-xBaxMnO3 is a 
representative manganite that exhibits 
colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and 
 4
was investigated ex situ with an atomic-force 
microscope (AFM). These observations were 
conducted with a contact mode on an area  3 
μm ×  3 μm. The electrical transport 
properties were examined by measurements 
using a standard four-probe method. A 
superconducting quantum-interference device 
magnetometer was used to measure the 
magnetization.  
  
4. Result and Discussion 
Figure 1 presents (H00) CTR intensity 
profiles of LBMO epilayers and LBMO/STO 
superlattices grown on various substrates. For 
simplicity, values of H, K and L given in this 
paper are expressed in reciprocal lattice units 
(r. l. u.) referred to the STO lattice parameter 
(3.905Å near 295K) and that for the LBMO 
epilayer grown on an LAO substrate are 
referred to the LAO lattice parameter (3.78Å 
at room temperature) [15]. The critical 
thickness for misfit dislocations is roughly 
estimated using a model that was proposed by 
Matthews [16]. The critical thickness of the 
LBMO epilayer was calculated: ~700Å for 
LBMO/STO [17]; ~370Å for LBMO/LNO, 
and ~60Å for LBMO/LAO heteroepitaxy. The 
angular position of the (200) reflections was 
used to evaluate the in-plane lattice parameter 
of the manganite epilayers [18]. Notably, an 
in-plane lattice parameter of 3.905Å is 
required for the pseudomorphic growth of an  
LBMO epilayer on the STO substrate (3.887Å 
and 3.78Å for LNO-coated STO and LAO 
substrates, respectively). From the (200) 
diffraction patterns, the location of the Bragg 
peak of the LBMO/STO superlattice grown 
on the STO substrate is quite close to that of 
the substrate; the almost pseudomorphic 
growth of the LBMO and STO sublayers in 
the superlattice structure from the substrate is 
maintained. The in-plane lattice constant of 
the 720Å-thick LBMO epilayer grown on an 
LAO substrate is 3.921Å, which is close to 
the bulk lattice constant of LBMO (3.92Å). A 
large misfit of 3.6% for LBMO/LAO 
heteroepitaxy resulted in the full relaxation of 
the strain of the epilayer from the LAO 
substrate. Moreover, LBMO epilayers grown 
on STO and LNO-coated STO substrates and 
the superlattice on an LNO-coated STO 
substrate all exhibit partial straining. Notably, 
the H index of the (200) Bragg peak of the 
superlattice grown on an LNO-coated STO 
substrate exceeds that of the LBMO single 
epilayer grown on the STO substrate. For a 
coherent LBMO/STO superlattice, the 
in-plane lattice parameter of the least strained 
bilayer in a symmetric superlattice structure 
can be estimated by the minimization of the 
strain energy induced from the misfit [19]. 
The in-plane lattice constant of the least 
strained LBMO-STO bilayer is around 
3.912Å. The mismatch between the least 
strained LBMO-STO bilayer and the 
1800Å-thick LNO epilayer is ~0.7%. This 
misfit makes the critical thickness of a 
LBMO/STO superlattice approximately 450Å. 
The thickness of the superlattice with a 
modulation length of 120Å and 12 bilayers 
markedly exceeds the critical value. However, 
the thickness of a single LBMO epilayer 
(720Å) on the STO substrate slightly exceeds 
the critical value (~700Å).  Accordingly, the 
strain relief in the LBMO/STO superlattice on 
an LNO-coated STO substrate is higher than 
 6
and an LBMO/STO superlattice on the STO. 
No marked energy shift occurs at the edge 
between the spectra obtained in the plane, 
indicating that the Mn atoms of these 
manganite epilayers have almost the same 
oxidation states.  Tentatively, this fact 
eliminates the possibility that process 
instability is responsible for modifications in 
the local structure of manganite films. 
     The Curie temperature (Tc) was 
determined from the curves of the 
temperature-dependence of magnetization 
M(T). From Fig. 5, all the M(T) curves of the 
samples clearly exhibit a paramagnetic to 
ferromagnetic transition. The LBMO/STO 
superlattice on the STO substrate has the 
lowest Tc~178K; a single LBMO epilayer on 
the LAO substrate has the largest Tc ~313K. 
Notably, the Tc of all the superlattices is lower 
than that of a single LBMO epilayer on the 
same substrate. This fact may be related to the 
fact that the superlattices have greater strain 
than epilayers with a similar effective 
thickness (as revealed in Table I). Figure 6 
shows the temperature dependence of 
resistance ρ(T) for LBMO epilayers grown on 
the STO and LAO substrates. The Tp 
(temperature of the resistance maximum) of 
the LBMO epilayers on the STO and LAO 
substrates was also determined from the 
curves of the temperature-dependence of 
resistance in a zero magnetic filed. The Tp of 
the superlattice was not measured to exclude 
possible interface scattering at the 
LBMO/STO hetero-interfaces for transport 
perpendicular to the superlattice structure, and 
thereby to elucidate the true strain effect on Tp.  
For manganite epilayers with the same degree 
of the effective thickness, the Tp of the 
unstrained LBMO epilayer on the LAO 
substrate clearly exceeds that of the -0.25 % 
strained LBMO epilayer on the STO substrate. 
This result is consistent with results reported 
by Yeh et al. [25] and Hawley et al. [26] for 
other CMR films. Additionally, the measured 
maximum resistance of the unstrained 
720Å-thick LBMO epilayer on the LAO is 
13.4mΩ-cm and that of the -0.25 % strained 
LBMO epilayer on the STO is 33.5 mΩcm. 
The strain is the essential factor in the 
increase of resistance of the strained LBMO 
epilayer. The formation of polaron due to the 
large Jahn-Teller distortion in the LBMO 
lattice will reduce the conductivity of the 
LBMO epilayer [27]. Figure 7 shows the 
temperature dependence of the 
magnetoresistance (MR) ratio for the 
unstrained LBMO epilayer on the LAO 
substrate and the -0.25% in-plane strained 
LBMO epilayer on the STO. The MR ratio is 
defined as [ρ(0)-ρ(H)]/ρ(0), where ρ(0) and 
ρ(H) are resistance values measured in both 
zero and applied magnetic fields, respectively. 
Under a magnetic field of 2T, the MR ratio at 
the transition temperature is 36 and 46 % for 
the unstrained and the -0.25 % strained 
LBMO epilayers, respectively. From the Fig.7, 
it was found not only the rise of MR ratio 
with the strength of the magnetic field but a 
strain dependence which affects the width of 
the metal-insulator transition and the 
maximum achievable value of MR for an 
applied field. With a larger lattice strain in the 
LBMO epilayer, the peak maximum of the 
MR(T) curve increases, and the MR(T) curve 
becomes broader.  From Fig. 8, both Tc and
