Abstract 
The stability and reliability of probe laser 
is an important factor affecting the inspection 
of phase transformation process of Si thin films 
during excimer laser crystallization using 
in-situ time-resolved optical measurements. 
The changes in 2D intensity profile, peak 
power density, and beam wander of the 
commonly used helium-neon (He-Ne) and 
diode laser are investigated experimentally. It 
is found that the peak power density of He-Ne 
laser is higher than that of diode laser, while 
the total power of He-Ne laser is lower than 
that of diode laser. Although the instability in 
the peak power density of He-Ne laser will 
increase with increasing the operation time, the 
beam stability of He-Ne laser is better than that 
of diode laser. For long-time operation (＞ 24 
hours) of optical measurements, the diode laser 
is a good candidate of probe laser. Conversely, 
the diode laser is suitable for the short-time 
operation ( ＜ 24 hours) of optical 
measurements because the beam-wander is 
higher than that of He-Ne laser.

density and beam wander of the commonly used He–Ne
and diode laser are investigated experimentally. The
appropriate probe laser employed for short-time (o24 h)
and long-time (424 h) operation of the in-situ real-time
optical measurements during in-line large-area ﬂat panel
display fabrication using low-temperature polycrystalline
silicon thin-ﬁlm transistors is suggested.

dynamics of a-Si thin ﬁlms during ELC. Details of the

better than710% energy variation. All the experiments are
carried out under ambient conditions.
Beam characteristics such as 2D intensity proﬁle, peak
power density, and beam wander are examined using a
beam proﬁler (FX 50, wavelength ¼ 260–1100nm, OPHIR).
The experimental set-up employed for beam characteristics
determination is shown schematically in Fig. 2, including a
sketch of the computer controlled data acquisition system.
The incident beam of probe laser is manipulated almost
perpendicular to the beam proﬁler. Two commonly used
probe lasers, He–Ne (wavelength ¼ 632.8 nm) and diode
laser (wavelength ¼ 645 nm), are investigated experimen-
tally. To improve the resolution of optical measurements,
an aperture and a lens are employed to deliver the probe
laser beam into the charge-coupled device sensors for
characterization. Differences in beam characteristic be-
tween He–Ne and diode laser are investigated and analyzed
in order to evaluate a probe laser with excellent stability
and reliability for the optical measurements of phase
transformation in thin ﬁlms during ELC under a wide
variety of measurement conditions.

C.-C. Kuo / Optics and Lasers in Engineering 46 (2008) 440–445 441As a starting material, silane-based 90-nm-thick a-Si ﬁlm is
deposited on a 0.7-mm-thick glass substrate (Corning 1737)
covered with a 300 nm SiO2 layer by plasma-enhanced
chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). These specimens are
then dehydrogenated by performing a thermal treatment at
500 1C for 2 h to reduce the hydrogen content for
preventing ablation caused by sudden hydrogen eruption
during ELC [19]. The specimen is then held between self-
closing tweezers at the end of a cantilever beam ﬁxed on the
x–y precision translation stage. The x- and y-axis displace-
ment of the two stages can be manipulated (resolution ¼
0.625 mm) accurately. The movement of the focusing lens
mounted on the motorized z-axis stage is controlled
precisely to adjust the desired excimer laser ﬂuence for
crystallization. The energy of the excimer laser pulse is
monitored using a pyroelectric Joule meter (Vector H410
SCIENTECH). The variation in pulse-to-pulse excimer
laser energy is found to be less than 5%. The a-Si thin ﬁlms
are irradiated by an XeF excimer laser beam (LAMBDA
PHYSIK COMPex 102, wavelength ¼ 351 nm, repetition
rate ¼ 1Hz) with laser ﬂuences ranging from 70 to
300mJ/cm2. A stainless slit (4 15mm2) located in the
optical path of excimer laser is employed to transform the
incident Gaussian beam into a rectangular beam spot withFig. 1. Schematic illustration of the TFig. 2. Measurement system for determining the stability and reliability of

beam-wander of He–Ne laser is smaller than that of diode
laser. The standard deviation of beam-wander for both
He–Ne and diode lasers can be calculated based in Eq. (1).
Fig. 7 shows the standard deviation of beam-wander along
the x-axis and the y-axis for the He–Ne and diode lasers.
As can be seen from this ﬁgure, the standard deviation of
beam-wander of both the x-axis and y-axis for He–Ne laser
is lower than that of diode laser, revealing that the He–Ne
probe laser is more stable for optical measurements during
ELC because less noise signal in the spot is detected. Thus,
the smaller the standard deviation of beam-wander is, the
better the resolution of optical measurements. Similar
trends are also observed during 5–24 h of laser operation.
From the above experimental results, it is found that the
diode laser is a good candidate of probe laser for long-time
operation (424 h) in the in-situ real-time optical measure-
ments during in-line large-area ﬂat panel display fabrica-
tion using low-temperature polycrystalline silicon thin-ﬁlm
transistors. Conversely, the diode laser is not suitable for
short-time operation (o24 h) of optical measurements
since the beam-wander and variations in peak power
density are higher than that of He–Ne laser. For practical
applications, melting and recrystallization phenomena of
a-Si thin ﬁlms for both frontside and backside ELC have

in Ein the recording processes. The probe laser is turned on at
least thirty minutes before the optical measurements are
made. In general, a very stable single mode laser at the
desired wavelength can be employed as a probe laser for
monitoring the explosive crystallization (EC) [21] and
melting and crystallization scenario during ELC. In the
practical experiments, Hatano et al. [22] did not observe
the EC phenomenon by optical measurements using
He–Ne as a probe laser because the thickness of a-Si
is very thin (50 nm). Consequently, thick a-Si thin ﬁlms
(600 [23], 200 [9] and 370 nm [24]) were utilized to examine
the EC phenomenon during ELA. The EC phenomena
are observed for 50- and 90-nm-thick silicon thin ﬁlms
by optical measurements using He–Ne probe laser during
ELC. Details of this phenomenon are described in a
previous study [16].
Fig. 4 shows the peak power density functions of He–Ne
and diode lasers during 4–24 h of laser operation. Clearly,
the peak power density functions for He–Ne laser are lower
than that of diode laser, while the peak power density for
He–Ne laser is unstable during the ﬁrst thirty minutes.
The instability in peak power density for He–Ne laser is
conceivable and can be observed in Fig. 4(c), indicating the
drawback of He–Ne laser. Following the initial warm-up,
the He–Ne laser output intensity remains stabilized for
many hours. This means that adequate warm-up times are
particularly critical for He–Ne laser, which requires stable
temperature for stable operation. The diode laser itself
does not require any warm-up, responding in a matter of
nanoseconds or less to direct electrical modulation. The
peak power density variations of He–Ne and diode lasers
during 4–24 h of laser operation can be calculated
according to Eqs. (1)–(3). Fig. 5 shows the peak power
density variations of He–Ne and diode lasers as a function
of time. Two phenomena can be obviously observed from
this ﬁgure. One phenomenon is that the variation in peak
power density increases with increasing the time of
operation for both He–Ne and diode lasers and the other
one is that the scattered range of the variation in the peak
power density of He–Ne laser is lower than that of diode

4. Conclusions
Optical property characterizations of He–Ne and diode
probe laser employed in the optical diagnostics of melting and
resolidiﬁcation dynamics for thin ﬁlms have been investigated
experimentally using a beam proﬁler. It is found that the beam
stability of He–Ne laser is better than that of diode laser
although the instability in the peak power density of He–Ne
laser will increase with increasing the operation time. For
optical measurements with longer durations (424h) of optical
measurements, it is suggested that the diode laser is a good
candidate of probe laser. On the other hand, the diode laser is
suitable for the short-time optical measurements (o24h) of
optical measurements since the beam-wander and peak power
density variations are higher than that of He–Ne laser. The
results reported here provide an important application for
selecting a suitable probe laser in precision optical measure-
ments and experiments of phase transformation processes of
