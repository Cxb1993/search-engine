前   言 
近年來由於醫療科技的進步，健康養生觀念越來越受重視，國人平均壽命逐年增加，精神與
體能狀況仍維持良好的健康銀髮族群也不斷增加，這群健康銀髮族的社會活動力仍相當活躍，再
加上近年來由歐美國家導入的「樂活(LOHAS)」觀念，使得這個族群期待可以一直像壯年期般的
生活著，每天都可以很隨興的去從事各項休閒活動或社交。然其體力狀況終究會隨著年齡增長而
逐漸退化，因此，開發一部專為銀髮族樂活休閒而設計，可以合乎未來銀髮族生活情境需求的前
瞻性載具，應該是相當重要且值得投入的工作。 
本計畫即以「銀髮族樂活休閒載具的前瞻設計」為目標，結合了電機、機械、材料及工設四大
領域的研發團隊，再組織架構及分工上，則由子計畫一以通用設計及人因工程等設計手法，定義
銀髮族樂活休閑載具的設計概念及操作介面，據此子計畫二在其載具機構設計與開發試製中，整
合了子計畫三開發的創新高效鋰電池，與子計畫四開發的馬達驅動電路與電源充放電管理系統，
本期已完成載具的原型機。原型機具有驗證其他子計劃研發成果的功能，其驗證結果可為第二年
計畫，訂定更明確的研發目標，作為各子計畫研發的重點方向。 
研究目的 
現今市售供老人使用的移動載具中，大部份的設計都與殘障車無異，絕大多數有社交代
步需求的健康銀髮族，是不太可能去使用這種載具的。然而銀髮族的行動力無法進行長時間、
遠距離的行走，腳踏車雖然是目前較方便的選擇，但腳踏車的騎乘技術依賴，及對突發狀況
的高反應需求，在使用時對銀髮族常常構成安全威脅。因此如能開發一部能顧及老人且又能
夠普及為大眾所使用的，短距離以休閒為目的之移動載具，想必能夠引起市場一定的回響，
並且造福銀髮族。 
本計畫主要以銀髮族的樂活休閒需求為標的，主要的研究目的便是要開發一部具前瞻功
能的銀髮族樂活休閒載具。子計畫一將分析老年人的各項需求，以前瞻性設計概念及操作介
面的定義，與優質造型設計為計畫目的；子計畫二以開發試製各種滿足概念需求的機構、操
控系統…等裝置為目的。子計畫三以開發高效高安全性創新鋰電池為目的；子計畫四的研究
目的是，將馬達驅動電路與充電電路整合為一個完整的電源管理系統，除了簡化電路，並考
慮電池殘量偵測及鋰電池充電策略。 
文獻探討 
本計畫運用了生活型態分析法[1]來劃分不同族群，並使用 AIO 量表[2]來研究該族群之生
活型態之差異，並從其生活型態之差異來找出該族群之載具需求；另外一方面從情境故事分
析法[3]的方式將銀髮族使用載具的問題點從情境故事中導出所有問題點，根據以上兩點將所
有問題點導出後即可歸納出是設計原則，但因為銀髮族群在生理、心理都會有退化的狀況，
所以在載具的使用上結合了通用設計[4]的概念，並使用 PPP(Product Performance Program)量
表[5]來檢測現有產品的優缺點，來當作設計載具時的參考。 
本計畫之載具必須達到輕量化與智慧化兩個訴求，目前市售產品較符合輕量化概念的非
3 
大致上可歸類為四大部分，包括：第一部分是直流無刷馬達的驅動、調速控制 [1]-[10]，此部分
大多是探討無感測直流無刷馬達之驅動電路與控制方法；第二部分主要是有關於鋰鐵電池模組之
充電策略及電量平衡電路 [11]-[19]，此部分是希望能以較佳之充電方式提高電池電量；第三部分
的重點是在於電動車鋰電池殘餘電量偵測、顯示 [20]-[22]；另外，第四部分則是討論到雙向轉換
器 [23]-[27]的作法，此部分的論點非常有助於實現電池充電/馬達驅動合一之雙用電路。 
 
研究方法 
本計劃結合機械電機材料工設四大領域，開發銀髮族樂活休閒載具的目標一致，但各領域所
採取的研究方法差異性頗大，各子計畫採取的研究方法分述如下 
【子計畫一】第一年之研究步驟與方法如下圖所示。其細部過程如下所述： 
(1) 以生活型態量表分析不同生活型態健康老人休閒之類型： 
參考 Plummer(Plummer,1974 )所提出的 AIO 變數量表，發展適合本計畫之生活型態問卷亦即依
循活動、興趣、意見、人口統計變數等分成四大構面，每一種構面又有九個子構面；而針對我
們所要研究的主題挑選所需子構面進行問卷設計，再以改良式李克特尺度量表（Likert Scale），
將選項分六個區隔來評量。 
(2) 探討各類型老人休閒時之載具需求與差異 
除針對(1)項所得到之結果外配合相關文獻探討，將所有問題點條列出，並針對問題點設計問
卷，在將問卷結果和不同族群之銀髮族進行交叉比對，以得到各個族群休閒時之載具需求特徵。 
(3)以情境分析銀髮族在生活中之載具功能： 
依上述問題與載具特徵建構情境故事，情境故事法分為兩個階段：首先構思出了八個不同的情
境故事，從情境故事中將問題點導出，然後開始製作生活情境的影片，並把情境影片給銀髮族
觀看，從反映中得到相關意見或是忽略掉的問題，再將所得到的問題點分成生理、心理及轉乘
問題三個大類別，接下來又依不同類別製作了十種不同的情境故事和影片來導出更精確的問題
方向。 
(4) 以 PPP(Product Performance Program)量表進行現有輕型載具之通用性評估 
首先針對市場上所有折疊腳踏車進行檢索，並針對折疊方式的不同進行分類，總共歸納出三大
類折疊方式：1.車體對折式 2.支架摺疊變形 3.縱向式摺疊。然後從此三大類中找出較有代表性
之折疊車進行 PPP 量表的分析。依通用設計提到的 PPP 的 37 項原則，篩選出 12 項問題進行問
卷，再由不同項目繪出 PPP 量表之圖形進行比對與討論。 
(5)對設計要素與通用設計進行多變量分析 
將 AIO 問卷所得結果進行分析，首先假設所有問題點再使用載具的過程中的影響程度是全部相
同的；而對立假設就是所有問題點對使用載具的影響程度是不完全相同的。並進行 ANOVA 分
析(α=0.05)，ANOVA 分析過後可知假設－所有問題點在使用載具的過程中之影響程度不是全部
相同的，得到這個結論之後，使用 LSD 分組的方式將問題點分組，將影響程度的大小依序排列，
做為往後設計要素的參考。 
(6)車體概念設計 
子計畫之車體概念設計分兩階段進行，在第一階段主要是針對現況分析與迴避進行外觀設計，
是測試使用者反應。第二階段則是對子計畫二之車體進行外觀設計與分析。 
研究流程圖(如右圖)：

【子計畫二】 
子計劃二本期的首要目標為載具雛型機的開發試製，計畫的進行分兩期，初期密集的與
子計畫一的團隊腦力激盪與討論，以定義載具所應具備的各項基本機能與機構需求，接著便
在掌握幾個重要設計概念後，逕行著手原型機的開發試製，採取的方法如下： 
1. 專利檢索與市售產品分析，檢索字串：Folding/Light/Portable/Bike/Quick Release Device/
快拆機構/摺疊車/折疊腳踏車/電動車。 
2. 與子計畫一討論載具需求與可發展之機能，利用手繪或者 CAD 軟體進行快拆機構與車體
初步的設計。 
3. 了解市售腳踏車各個零組件的裝配方式，並找尋廠商購買設計所需零件。 
4. 建立載具測試平台，以測試輪穀馬達、車體結構、驅動方式、以及煞車如何配置…等問
題。其他還包刮子計畫三電池應用於測試載具之實測與子計畫四驅動器之測試。 
5. 自動跟隨機制的開發/摺疊機構/車體結構，同步進行設計與實測。 
6. 完成第部原型機，提供整合各個子計畫成果之載具測試平台。 
【子計畫三】 
以溶液法合成純相 LiFePO4 粉末。先將 H3PO4(85%, Wako Pure Chem. Ind., Ltd., Japan)和鐵粉
(NC100.24, 99%, Hoganas, Sweden)以 1：1 的莫耳比溶於去離子水中，再加入檸檬酸(99.5%, Wako 
Pure Chem. Ind., Ltd., Japan)。再加入 LiOH、蔗糖攪拌 4 小時後，於 60oC 下以減壓濃縮方式烘乾
成膠狀。再把此膠狀物在 100oC 的真空烘箱中，烘乾得到前驅粉末。將前驅粉末置於氮氣氣氛中，
先經 300oC 持溫煆燒 8 小時，然後在于 700oC 下持溫熱處理 8 小時，接著爐冷到室溫，即可得純
相橄欖石結構的磷酸鋰鐵陰極材料。 
負極活性材合成方式，是由黏結瀝青粉末在空氣中加熱至 500oC，持溫 1 小時，爐冷到室溫
時，在升溫至 800oC，氮氣氣氛下持溫 1 小時，可得到介穩相瀝青碳(MPC)。 
將合成粉末與乙炔碳黑(acetylene carbon black，99.99%，Strem Chemical Inc.，U.S.)、聚偏氟乙烯
PVDF (polyvinyidene fluoride，Kynar 740，ELF，Germany)以重量比 83:10:7 的比例，於 NMP (ultra，
ISP Technologies Inc.，U.S.A.)中攪拌 24 小時，使其成均勻的漿狀。將調製好的漿料以刮刀機塗
佈於鋁箔紙上，並將刮好的薄片放入烘箱中烘乾 12 小時。沖成直徑為 10mm 的圓形正極片。以
鋰箔為負極、活性材為正極、Celgard 2400 為 隔離膜、1M LiPF6 in EC/DEC/PC (Vol. 1：1：1) 為
電解液，於手套箱內組成 2032 鈕釦型電池，進行循環充放電測試。 
【子計畫四】 
本計畫主要負責開發載具的智慧型電源管理系統，主要工作是將馬達驅動電路與充電電
路以雙向電路整合為一個完整的電源管理系統，其系統方塊圖如圖 1，各部分工作分述如下： 
1. 馬達驅動： 
圖 1 所示為三相驅動電路與輪轂馬達之系統結構圖，此系統以兩顆 12V 蓄電池當作電力來
源，經由一組三相換流器來驅動 24V/250W 之三相直流無刷輪轂馬達。其中三相換流器是由六顆
功率電晶體 (S1~S6)所組成，藉由 DSP 控制器所產生之週期性控制信號可將直流電源轉換成三相
交流電源。再者，馬達定子上裝有霍爾感測元件可用來偵測轉子位置，再將轉子位置訊號回傳至
DSP 控制器，以判斷轉子目前的位置，再送出對應的時序控制信號至六個功率電晶體輪流切換，
維持馬達正常運轉。

斷電池電壓是否為過電壓或欠電壓，若是則不作驅動，以保護系統及電池；若電池電壓正常，則
在驅動過程中會持續判斷是否過電流現象，若出現過電流則立刻關閉 PWM 信號，以保護系統及
馬達，控制流程如圖 3b 所示。

4. 電池殘量偵測： 
本子計畫為了延長電池壽命，在電池充電前先估測電池殘量，以決定充電電流及模式。如
圖 4 所示之流程圖，在充電前，首先藉由開路電壓法直接量測電池電壓，利用查表方式經由內建
之換算表，得知電池對應之初始電量值。其次，經由公式計算當下電量對應之充電電流，並開始
以定電流模式(CC 模式)充電。再者，隨著充電過程進行，利用庫倫法以充電電流及充電時間，

本年度進度規劃： 
計畫整體目標：樂活休閒載具基本機能的設定與開發---原型機開發(原計畫書中設定)

[子計畫一結果與討論] 
本年度主要研究成果如下： 
(1) 以生活型態量表分析不同生活型態健康老人休閒之差異： 
以休閒方式為橫軸，社交方式為縱軸來進行分類，將 120 位所有的受測者分成四大族群：(A)
戶外休閒-主動社交、(B)戶外休閒-被動社交、(C)室內休閒-主動社交、(D)室內休閒-被動社
交。

三款現有車之 PPP 量表比對 
比較三型車款之 PPP 量表顯示，縱向式折疊車在使用性、耐久性、公平性、安全性、身體負
擔各項皆優於其餘兩種車款，唯獨五官訊息一項低於其餘兩種車款；往後設計之新型載具應保留
縱向車款的優點，並加強活用五官訊息之設計。 
(5) 對設計要素與通用設計進行多變量分析： 
在所有受測者的統計數據中以 ANOVA 進行變異系數分析；65 歲以上的受測者之
P-Value>0.05=α；55 歲至 65 歲的受測者 P-Value >0.05=α，以上三種結果在 0.05 的信賴區間中，
都有足夠的證據顯示所有的問題點對於載具的影響是不相同的。LSD 分組後所有受測者的問題點
影 響 載 具 大 排 至 小 為 ： Q5>Q9>Q8=Q4=Q10=Q6=Q2>Q3=Q7=Q1 ； 55~64 歲 受 測 者 為
Q5>Q9>Q10=Q4=Q6=Q2=Q8>Q1=Q7=Q3 ； 65 歲 以 上 受 測 者 為
Q5>Q9>Q10=Q4=Q6=Q2=Q8>Q1=Q7=Q3；仔細觀察後可發現，三組結果雖說在平均數值大小排
列上有些許差異，但用 LSD 排列後的結果皆為同一種結果。

[子計畫二結果與討論] 
    本計畫試製了兩版原型機，圖 5-1 為第一版，主要用以測試輪圈馬達的特性，至於載具
型態的設計概念已遭放棄，目前正進行測試的載具原型機如圖 5-2 所示，載具上使用子計畫
三開發的新型高效高安全性鋰電池，及子計畫四開發的 DC 無刷輪圈馬達驅動器，本計劃後
續將以此原型機提供各子計畫做為測試平台。本子計畫也在一台小型自走車上先行發展完成
一載具之自動跟隨控制系統如圖 5-3 所示，此系統初期測試的結果已具備所設定的基本功
能，下期計畫將移植到載具上。圖 5-4 顯示此載具的摺疊機構，目前採雙動力輪輪驅動模式，
因此不具腳踏車踩踏的功能，轉向控制則為搖桿全電控方式。檢討的結果認為下期應朝單輪
驅動(後右輪)，加入踩踏的機構(後左輪)，前輪為手動控制方向的機構改良，讓載具能有更直
接的操控性，且可以更輕量化。 
再鋰電池方面，經由這次的實測試結果，得知電池封裝與接點常會因為車體在較大或者
連續性的震動下，會有脫落的情況發生，因此將在往後電池的封裝上進行改良，以解決此一
問題。子計畫四驅動器的部分，必須考慮載具在不同載重下，所需的最大啟動扭力，其驅動
電壓的變化量，以減少因使用者重量的差異所造成的影響，可以減少瞬間加速所產生的暴衝
感。

的過程中，電容量在第 10 圈仍然維持在 750mAh，並將此正負極之 loading 比應用到後續 10Ah 電

[子計畫四結果與討論] 
本子計畫中針對休閒載具提供完整的電源管理技術，在第一年執行期間主要是以 DSP 
Controller 為控制核心，陸續完成輕量載具工作時所需的各項電力需求、配置與監測的核心單元—
輪轂馬達驅動器與充電器的整合，初步測試結果可明顯改善現有產品之安全性、穩定度及續航力，

[子計畫二 計畫成果自評] 
根據計劃第一年的規劃，子計畫二目前實際完成項目： 
(1) 協同子計畫一完成樂活休閒生活情境所需機構的概念發展與機能設定。 
(2) 根據初步定義的設計概念，完成載具原型機的設計試製，工作計畫執行的測試平台原型機。

(4) 載具原型機具新型摺疊式三輪車機構。 
(5) 成果報告 
    本子計畫於材料輕量化的部分尚未予以詳盡的考慮，原因在於原型機尚未加入各種樂活機

明確的定義，使功能與機構更為明確後，再加入材料與結構輕量化方面的考量。 
[子計畫三 計畫成果自評] 
因應子計畫二之需求，子計畫三先提供以純相磷酸鋰鐵正極材料組成之 10Ah 
LiFePO4/LiPF6/MCMB 鋁箔包全電池，與商用之充放電控制電路將 8 顆電池串接成電池組，
供子計畫二進行測試。未來將繼續探討雜質對電容衰減之影響及原因，著手改善 1Ah 鋰電池
高溫衰退之特性，7 月開始也將使用子計畫四自行研發的充放控制電路。 
 
[子計畫四 計畫成果自評] 
本子計畫並已完成一簡易之實驗平台，如圖 6 所示，可提供不同控制策略之試驗，並與其他

IPEC’10(如附件一、附件二)研討會，並擬將所開發之成果提出國內發明專利之申請。其次，本
計畫在有限的時間、人力與資源下，執行成效包括原型機之實體開發、會議論文投稿與發明專利

Abstract: The tasks of linking PC connectors to a computer were studied in the Bother-study and 
the Solution-study; and each study was accomplished with subjective questionnaire and objective 
test. From 59 questionnaires in Bother-study, the ANOVA test found that the larger bother 
connectors to the users were USB-B, PS2; and the Mini-USB, VGA the second. At the objective 
test, 20 subjects were asked to plug the randomized 8 connectors into a wall in blindfolded 
situation, the paired comparison showed that the mean error-linking frequency were: Mini-
USB>PS2>others; and the mean linking time were: Mini-USB, PS2>others. Four possible designs 
(Shape-idea, Dot-idea, Color-idea, and Hook-idea) which summarized from the Bother-study for 
improving the larger bother connectors (USB-B, Mini-USB, VGA, and PS2) were verified in the 
Solution-study. The ANOVA test found that the Dot-concept was considered to be the best solution 
in 134 questionnaires. Two types of Dot-idea with 1mm, 2mm dot height were proposed to 56 
subjects for them to test the linking effect. The mean linking time were reduced for USB-B, Mini-
USB and VGA but raised for PS2; the mean error-linking frequency were reduced for Mini-USB, 
but raised for the PS2. According to the results, the Dot-concept might be most suitable to the 
Mini-USB connector. The details of these different viewpoints were discussed in the end of this 
article. 
 
Key words: PC connector, subjective opinion, objective test, Industrial design, connector linking task. 
 
 
 
1. Introduction 
In our daily life, there are a number of tasks that we have to face under faint light or no light condition, such as 
to search a flashlight on the black out situation, or to link connectors on the back or side of a computer by hands. 
On the condition like that, the perception about the surroundings from our sensors will be severely affected and 
certainly the decision of our following actions will be changed. Most of us have to use the sense of touch 
combines with the hearing; smell and taste to explore all of the clues surround us, and then vamp up all the 
information to make a decision for the next action. Facing the situation of no light, preexist experience on the 
task will be a contraposition to us for decision making. The subjective impressions for that situations are varied 
from person to person, and it might be hard to study the effects of the preexist thought under such situations. 
Normally the study about human performance can be categorized into two ways of methods, objective and 
subjective method. Researchers mentioned that the objective judgments are considered if they are used to reflect

There were two parts of studies in this paper, and each of the two parts preceded a subjective questionnaire and 
an objective experiment. Firstly, the Bother-study was intended to see the differences between the subjective 
view and objective experiment in the issue of linking 8 PC connectors. Secondly, the Solution-study was 
prepared for understanding the differences between the subjective view and objective test with 4 proposed 
designs for the larger bother connectors. 
 
2. Methods and Results 
2.1 Bother-study 
In order to see the bother of the linking tasks, our research team investigated the connectors under the current PC 
specification in the market and found that those 8 connectors (Mini-USB, Mic., PS2, VGA, USB-A, USB-B, 
Net), were frequently mentioned and included in a standard PC. In this Table 1, the paired connector and socket 
has its own way of preventing error-linking. When all of those sockets are put together on the backboard of a PC 
the user might have some bother on linking the paired connectors on the right sockets because some of them are 
similar not only at the shape but also at the size. But how much bother are the users felt? And which connector is 
the most bothered one? To understand what users might think of, a simple questionnaire was implemented to 
gather the subjective opinion of users in the Bother-study, and then a PC connector linking experiment was 
conducted in order to get the objective records from users.

2.1.1 Subjective Questionnaire (1) 
The subjective questionnaire was respond by 59 participants (university students recruited from TATUNG 
University), including 24 males and 35 females. They were asked to give their subjective opinions about the 
linking bother of those 8 connectors, in Table 1, in which the value from 1 till 6 represented the bother levels 
from ‘extremely low, very low, low, high, very high, extremely high’; and the value ‘0’ represented the level of 
‘no bother’. The ANOVA test showed that the mean bother score among those 8 connectors were significantly 
different, F (7,464) =18.720, p<0.001, and the LSD showed that those mean scores could be grouped into three 
groups (PS2, USB-B > Mini-USB, VGA > USB-B, Net, Mic., Power), see Figure 1.

2.1.2 Objective Experiment (1) 
After the subjective questionnaires finished, the objective test was conducted for the comparison with subjective 
opinion of users. There were 20 students recruited from the Graduate School of Industrial Design in TATUNG 
5 
 
In order to realize the objective opinions abut the four ideas from the users, a similar objective questionnaire as 
the one in the bother-study was employed. At this time, the respondents were showed a set of pictures that 
implemented each idea into the 4 most bothersome connectors and were asked to rate each idea on each 
connector. The question was that in the condition of the connector with one specific idea, how would they 
though the possibility of error-linking. A seven points Likert-scale which used the words of extremely low, very 
low, low, high, very high, extremely high and no comment, represented the score from 1-6 and 0 respectively, 
was accomplished. A total of 134 respondents (university students) who were selected from the different 
departments of TATUNG University replied this questionnaire. As the ANOVA test showed that the mean error-
linking scores among the 4 different ideas were significantly different within each connector, all of the four p 
values were lower than 0.01. The LSD test showed that the Dot idea had the lowest mean error-linking in all 
connector types, Table 3, which meant that the 134 respondents tended to believe the Dot idea could be a better 
way of reducing the bother of linking connectors.

Connector type F (3, 532) p-value LSD

Mini-USB 5.624 = 0.01 Dot, Color < Hook, Shape 
VGA 32.372 < 0.01 Dot < Color < Hook < Shape 
PS2 24.461 < 0.01 Dot < Color < Hook < Shape 
 
2.2.2 Objective Experiment (2) 
In order to know whether the Dot idea was good for those larger bother connectors in reducing the bother of 
linking, the authors made two types of Dot idea, 1.0 mm and 2.0 mm in different height but in the same diameter 
of 2.0 mm and in the same pitch of 3.0 mm, for those 4 bothered connectors. There were 56 subjects (Graduate 
School students and university students) recruited from the same school, 28 males and 28 females, and they were 
asked to link the 8 PC connectors, 4 Connectors x 2 Dot heights, in a randomized order. The procedure of this 
subjective experiment was the same as the experiment in the Bother-study, but the sockets were rearranged 
before each linking task proceeded. Same as the experiment before in the Bother-study, the error-linking 
frequency and the linking time were recorded by a digital camera and counted by the experimenter after the tests 
had finished. The ANOVA test was employed to see the differences among the 2 types of Dot idea and among 
the 4 connectors in each measured variable. The result showed that there was no significant difference found at 
these two measured variables between the two Dot ideas. But there were evidences found among these four 
bothered connectors, F (3,444) =32.813, 35.747, p<0.001, at the mean error-linking frequency and mean linking 
time variable, respectively. The PS2 connector had the largest mean value at the two variables, and the VGA 
connector had the lowest ones, Figure 4.

3 Discussions 
3.1 Subjective view and Objective view 
From the subjective questionnaires of Bother-study, the PS2 and USB-B had the largest bother score, followed 
by the Mini-USB and VGA connectors. But in the objective experiment the Mini-USB had the largest mean 
error-linking frequency, followed by the PS2; and the Mini-USB and PS2 had the largest mean linking time. So it

Through the Bother-study and the Solution-study each with subjective questionnaire and objective experiment in 
this paper, the authors propose a creative way of reaching much more insight of the users’ thoughts. The 
comparisons between the subjective view and objective view will inspire the designers to catch the ‘real’ desire 
of users and develop a more precise product into the market. In this article, 8 PC connectors were survey and 4 
ideas for reducing the bother of linking were also verified. The most bothersome connectors are the (PS2, Mini-
USB, USB-B, and VGA) and the most preferred idea is the Dot idea which is to add a number of dots on the 
major surface of the connector to indicate the insert direction for the users. The way of adding dots on the 
surface is efficient depended on those 4 connectors, whether the location of dots or the design of the dots itself 
should be further developed.  
 
The differences between subjective view and objective view in the problem of linking PC connectors showed 
that most of our thoughts about such problem come from the first image of the products, such thoughts might not 
be correct but it is prejudged. In our case, the bother of linking PC connectors was consistent between using 
questionnaire and by experiment. This might not be right all the time while discussing different problems. But it 
is a useful and a practical way to approach such problem in the manor of gathering the information both from 
subjective way and objective way, especially in a topic that normal people ignored or prejudged. The bother of 
Error-linking is such frequently happened in the daily life but by passed for their slightly effect on the main 
function of a product. This work highlights the issues that any problem causes only slightly bother should be 
taken into account from the end of the designer if it is neglected by the user.

Abstract. The purpose of this research is to emphasize on the concept of 
integrating computer and interactive technologies to the rehabilitation robotic 
with biofeedback. First, the robot is actuated with pneumatic muscle actuator  
which have interesting characteristics that can be exploited for upper limbed 
machines. The rehabilitation robotic system is using measurement which 
has two channels to detect and collect the rehabilitation robotic system 
from electromyography and the rotary encoder. Through PCI interface 
transferring the rehabilitation robotic system to personal computer, we 
can use our algorithms to attain real-time the force and/or contraction 
velocity of the muscle detection and other common information like the 
frequency of under muscle curve of user. Finally, the human-computer 
interface for rehabilitation system is designed. In this human computer interface 
consists of three main parts: detect the signal; a control scheme of robotic 
system combined with multimodal environment based biofeedback system; 
clinical database.

1   Introduction 
The most of contemporary robots use DC or AC motors like the actuators. However, 
these implementations are often too heavy and rigid, particularly for work in contact 
with human. Using of these “traditional” actuators in the field of rehabilitation and 
force feedback devices is especially unsuitable, because rehabilitation are usually 
grounded on the user is can not bear while being comfortable. The DC or AC motor is 
relatively unfriendly in feeling. That is the reason why the researchers try to find an 
actuator similar to human muscles. The most promising actuator in this field of 
research [1] is undoubtedly McKibben pneumatic muscle actuator(PMA).  
     A PMA which has achieved increased popularity to provide the inherent 
safety and mobility assistance to humans performing tasks and another advantages 
such as high strength and power/weight ratio, low cost, compactness, ease of 
maintenance, cleanliness, readily available and cheap power source and so on [2-4]. 
In contrast to traditional pneumatic actuators, PMA have very high power/weight and 
power/volume ratios [1], [2]. This is an advantage for robotic and exoskeleton 
applications, in which heavy actuators can add significantly to the payload.

2.2   Electrical Structure 
Many physiological processes can be monitored for biofeedback applications, and 
these processes are very useful for rehabilitation services. Biofeedback is a means for 
gaining control of our body processes to increase relaxation, relieve pain, and develop 
healthier, more comfortable life patterns. Electromyography is a seductive muse 
because it provides easy access to physiological processes that cause the muscle to 
generate force, produce movement and accomplish the countless functions which 
allow us to interact with the world around us [14]. 
The experiment are carried out according to the closed-loop structure of t the 
rehabilitation robotic shown in Fig. 2. In the rehabilitation robotic, the joint angle, θ, 
is detected measured by rotary encoder and the processing of electromyography 
(EMG) signals from the user and feedback to PC through PCI counter board and AD 
board, respectively. A primary function of the robot is controlling the gas pressure 
sent to PMA via the processing of electromyography (EMG) signals from the user. 
The rehabilitation robotic system is using measurement which has two channels to 
detect and collect the rehabilitation robotic system from EMG and the rotary encoder. 
Through PCI interface transferring the rehabilitation robotic system to personal 
computer, we can use our algorithms to attain real-time the force and/or contraction 
velocity of the muscle detection and other common information like the frequency of 
real pressure in muscles. User can set time, angle and force.

3.2   Human-Computer Interface  
The human-computer interface which operators of the rehabilitation engineer use is 
very important. If there is any operation error, the consequence will cause the muscle 
injuring. It is necessary to verify the design of interface which operators use in 
advance to prevent errors for the reason of inadequate design. Then we can get the 
advice for improvement, and low down the chance of error. In this human computer 
interface consists of three main parts: detect the signal; a control scheme of robotic 
system combined with multimodal environment based biofeedback system; clinical 
database. These interfaces are shown in Fig.4-6.

3.3   Clinical Database 
Users can check their medical treatment records just by entering ID numbers. 
Because the processing of rehabilitation, these records are very useful for long-term 
tracing and analyzing users’ condition. In this study, the rehabilitation database 
system consists of three main parts: user's operating time; user's functional ability 
dataset and related outcome information. From the experiences of establishing the 
database as well as the clinical data collection, suggestions about the use of the 
database and limitations will be discussed. Moreover, the development of this project 
facilitates the disabled persons to use commercial pointing devices that are lowly 
priced and easily available. Also, with this newly developed robotic, the disabled 
persons can have a second choice over some specific devices that are highly priced or 
difficult to maintain.

2.1 Existing Product Analyses 
From investigation of existing product function and operation mode, it is not hard to discover though the 
functions of products are the same, there are still differences among products due to theirs designers and the 
company developments. 
 
Table 1.  The operation difference of decreasing and enlarging between HTC Touch Mobile and Apple iPhone 
(Figures was used from manual through HTC and Apple)

Rotate in circle from right to left can make the photo 
rotate 90° according to the operating direction. 
Rotate iPhone sideways. The photo automatically 
reorients and expands the page. 
  
Rotating in hour-hand direction or against hour-hand 
direction to operate enlarging or decreasing function. 
Pinch to zoom in or out. 
 
The above problems, except for technology factors like Apple’s multipoint touchscreen, others are limited to 
designers’ design cognition and subjective consciousness. Why there’s a difference? What’s the principle for the 
operating mode design? And what objective operating mode should be like? These are the issues the research 
needs to explore. 
 
2.2 Touch Panel Technology and Interactive Interface Design Principles 
Cushman and Rosenberg (1991) proposed touchscreen operation and space flexibility is another advantage like 
software usages in the sense area can be easily defined, so that different designs can be produced from various 
demands [2]. In Designing Gestural Interfaces: Touchscreens and Interactive Devices by Dan Saffer (2008), it 
presented the common touch style sensors have 7 categories: pressure, light, proximity, acoustic, tilt, motion and 
orientation. Therefore, the characteristics of touch interactive gestures are proximity, duration, width, height, 
orientation, pressure, including objects, number of touch points and combination [3].  
 
Nielsen (1993,1994) proposed that usability has five characteristics: learnability, efficiency of use, memorability, 
Few and Non-catastrophic Errors, and subjective satisfaction [4,5,6]. Therefore, usability should not be solely 
defined at interface design. ISO 9241(1995) tried to solve this problem at a high level: it defines usability as a 
concept of quality in ergonomics by integrating the aspects of effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction [7]. 
 
3. Research Methods and Analyses 
There are 60 (39 females, 21 males) assigned subjects. All of them are college students and the age range is from 
18-24 years old. They are all right-handed users, can operate touch panel system independently and they never 
use multipoint touch screen products like iPhone, HTC Touch Mobile.

4.3 Gestural Operating Mode 
In the operating mode of selecting object, executing and moving object, rolling layout, changing pages, and 
rotate operating mode, the single hand and finger are used the most. It’s more common to use fingers to tap the 
screen while in small size; thumb would be used instead in the operating mode of selecting object. In rolling 
layout, the exact intuitive directions can not be identified. Many users would use two fingers of a hand to pinch 
and even use palms to operate in large-size touchscreen. Users use hands to write on screens more. 
 
5. Conclusion 
During experiments, task of object zoom-in or out and spin among eight tasks appear many intuitive operating 
modes. After interviewing respondents on executing tasks, it is found that due to the stereotype of MicroSoft 
system, respondents would use single finger in selection or in dragging; others though never use iPhone, but 
because of the advertisement, they would use thumb and index finger to pinch zoom in or out. Therefore, this 
influences the accuracy of the experiment but it shows experience and habit would affect one’s judgement. 
Moreover, the experiment explores the intuitive operating mode of horizontal and vertical style for small, middle 
and large size of screen, the results indicate even there are no significant differences in statistics, when operating 
small size of touch screen, the respondents use vertical style naturally while in larger screen size, the rates for 
using horizontal style enhance.

A complete circuit configuration of the proposed bi-
directional buck-boost converter is shown as Fig. 2.  The main 
circuit structure of the proposed system consists of three 
switches and four diodes. Various functions including bi-
directional power flow control can be switched under different 
operating mode. Fig. 3a shows the equivalent circuit in motor 
driving mode or energy recovery mode. In battery charging 
mode, the equivalent circuit is depicted as Fig. 3b. Each of the 
operating mode and the related mathematical models are 
described and derived, respectively, in the following.  
Mode I: Motor driving mode 
In this mode, the switch S2, S3, diode D1 and diode D4 are 
all turned off, diode D3 is turned on continuously. By 
switching the switch S1 and diode D2, this equivalent circuit 
behaves as a buck converter, and the battery Vbat can provide 
energy to the converter to drive the brushless DC (BLDC) 
motor. There are two states within an operating period like 
basic buck converter. When the switch S1 is on and the 
freewheeling diode D2 is off, the battery Vbat is charging to the 
inductor L, the capacitor C2 and is offering energy to the 
motor driving circuit as shown in Fig. 4a. Therefore, the 
inductor voltage VL can be expressed as

At the next state, the switch S1 is turned off and the

energy in the inductor L and the capacitor C will supply to the 
motor driving circuit to drive the BLDC motor. Fig. 4b

At the second state, the switch S1 is turned off and the

boosted to charge the battery and capacitor C1. The simplified 
equivalent circuit is shown as Fig. 7b. The inductor voltage is

III. CONTROL STRATEGY 
A single-chip DSP TMS320F2812 provided by Texas 
Instruments was used to implement a control core for the 
proposed bi-directional converter. This DSP has event 
manager and embedded control features, thereby allowing a 
sophisticated control algorithm to be implemented for power 
converting systems. There are many operating mode in the 
proposed system, including driving of BLDC, charging of 
battery, and detection of the battery capacity. Moreover, 
mathematical operation capability and multi-I/O features are 
required. Therefore, the DSP controller is employed to reduce 
component counts, to simplify controller structure, and 
improve the system reliability. Fig. 8 shows the flow chart of 
the proposed system, which is divided into motor driving 
mode and battery charging mode. 
 
Fig. 8 The flow chart of the system. 
 
1. Motor driving mode: 
While user selects this mode, the handle signal, which is an 
adjustable dc voltage, will be detected to control the duty 
cycle of the motor driving inverter, further, to regulate the 
motor speed.  The bi-directional converter will enter Mode I 
when the handle signal is detected, i.e., the battery offers 
energy for driving motor.  Conversely, the system will detect 
whether BEMF occurs or not. If not, it represents system idle, 
and the program will return to initial state. On the other hand, 
the electric bike may be decelerated or in descent state as the 
BEMF occurs. And then, the system will automatically select 
Mode III or Mode IV to recycle energy to battery according to 
whether the BEMF higher than battery voltage or not.  
 
2. Battery charging mode: 
The proposed bi-directional converter will behave as a buck 
converter when this mode is employed. Both having precise 
SOC estimation and suitable control strategy are essential for 
a well-designed charger. Generally, the open-circuit voltage 
                                                                                       ICIEA 2010

is also served as a charger, which converted the rectified

A complete circuit configuration of the proposed 
bidirectional buck-boost converter is shown as Fig. 2.  
The main circuit structure of the proposed system 
consists of three switches and four diodes. Various 
functions including bidirectional power flow control can 
be switched under different operating mode. Fig. 3a 
shows the equivalent circuit in motor driving mode or 
energy recovery mode. In battery charging mode, the 
equivalent circuit is depicted as Fig. 3b. Each of the 
operating mode and the related mathematical models are 
described and derived, respectively, in the following.  
Mode I: Motor driving mode 
In this mode, the switch S2, S3, diode D1 and diode D4 
are all turned off, diode D3 is turned on continuously. By 
switching the switch S1 and diode D2, this equivalent 
circuit behaves as a buck converter, and the battery Vbat 
can provide energy to the converter to drive the 
brushless DC (BLDC) motor. There are two states 
within an operating period like basic buck converter. 
When the switch S1 is on and the freewheeling diode D2 
is off, the battery Vbat is charging to the inductor L, the 
capacitor C2 and is offering energy to the motor driving 
circuit as shown in Fig. 4a. Therefore, the inductor

down the dc voltage to charge battery via the 
bidirectional converter by switching the switch S1 and

Mode IV: BEMF charging mode (VBF < Vbat) 
Operating in this mode, the switch S1, diode D2, D3, 
D4, are all off, and the switch S3 is turned on 
continuously. When the back electromotive force 
(BEMF) generated by motor is lower than the battery 
voltage Vbat, then, we can step up the dc voltage to 
charge battery via the bidirectional converter by 
switching the switch S2 and diode D1. In the first state, 
the switch S2 is on and the freewheeling diode D1 is off, 
the energy generated by BEMF is stored in the inductor 
L and capacitor C1, respectively. The equivalent circuit

III. CONTROL STRATEGY 
A single-chip DSP TMS320F2812 provided by Texas 
Instruments was used to implement a control core for the 
proposed bidirectional converter. This DSP has event 
manager and embedded control features, thereby 
allowing a sophisticated control algorithm to be 
implemented for power converting systems. There are 
                                       
 
%18~%153 =SD  (39) 
The corresponding waveforms are illustrated as Fig. 
10b. Assume the operating frequency f=30 kHz, and the 
charging current about 2A, then the minimum inductor 
value Lmin=198μH can be calculated by (21). The 
selected inductor value must satisfy the requirements of 
Mode I and Mode II simultaneously and plus 20% 
tolerance, thus, the practical inductor value L=238μH is 
selected in this system. 
After determining the inductor value, the output 
capacitor values in Mode I and Mode II also can be 
obtained, respectively. Assume the output voltage ripple 
is below 1%, then referring to (19) and (22), the output 
capacitor values in Mode I and Mode II can be obtained 
as C2min =8.75μF and C1min=49.6μF, respectively. Take 
into consideration the 20% tolerance, the practical 
values C1=60μF and C2=10.5μF are used in experiments. 
Mode III and Mode IV:  
Operating in these two modes, the BEMF caused by 
the motor will be recycled to battery. The corresponding 
waveforms are illustrated as Fig. 10c and 10d, 
respectively.

V. EXPERIMENTS 
Fig. 11 shows the measured waveforms of the Mode I, 
where the Vbat=28V converted to Vm=25V, and the duty 
cycle of the power switch S1 is 87% as estimated in 
previous section. When operating in Mode II or battery 
charging mode, the rectified dc voltage VS=155V is step 
down to charge battery by CC-CV charging. In Fig. 12, 
the duty cycle of the power switch S3 is 16%, that is, the 
charging procedure has changed to CV mode. Figs. 13 
and 14 show the measured waveforms of Mode III and

Abstract: Touch panel has been a new trend. It is an intuitive interface design based on human 
actions and feelings from life experiences. However, when designing the interface, the incomplete 
investigation and design may lead to the incorrect cognition and obstacle for users. From operating 
mode of existing touch panel products and intuition investigation of respondents, the research 
discusses each group has different cognition and response to intuition under various cultural 
backgrounds and life experiences. The research discovered that respondents have significant 
differences on holding style of middle-sized multipoint touchscreen, intuitive operating modes of 
object zoom in or out, and object spin. The results of the research can not only establish the correct 
intuitive operating concept and avoid the operating troubles caused by different ethnic groups but 
also be great helps for internationalizing the products and designs. 
 
Key words: Intuitive Interfaces, Touch Panel, Lifestyle, Operation Feedback. 
 
 
 
1. Introduction 
Intuitive interface is an interface design based on actions and feelings from daily life experiences or from control 
of gestures, languages, touching, and olfaction. It is easy to interact with the system and learn how to use it. After 
the input device changes into touching system, the intuitive operating helps lower operation difficulty and 
decrease the trouble in learning. It also shows the influences of various lifestyles, referring to various cultural 
backgrounds and life experiences, each group has quite differences on cognition and responses of intuition. If the 
designers and producers do not have well-structured investigation before design, it may lead to Human-Machine 
Interface (HMI) problem. Therefore, the research focuses on literature review, multipoint screen selection 
sequence of existing products, task operating modes, user’s intuitive operating, and assigned operation modes by 
designers. The comparisons are to receive the best operating mode for the users. 
 
2. Existing Product Analyses and Literature Reviews  
The iSuppli Company indicated though resistive touchscreen can not last long, it is the most common 
touchscreen technology on markets. However, start from 2008, till now, the technologies of cellular phones has 
turned into sensor-in-pixel and in-cell touch [1]. 
3 
 
 
The equipments include 30"(large), 8"(middle), and 3.5"(small) three sizes touchscreen models, digital video and 
camera stand to record of research procedures. Categorize the previous survey of multi touch interactive screens 
and literature reviews. These are for operating method’s design and planning. In the research, three main 
variables are screen size, operation task and gestural operating mode. The experiment is divided into two parts. 
First, address respondents’ subjective cognition on holding styles and operating directions for different standards 
of touch screen. Second, take the image records of imitated operating three sizes of touchscreens for analyzing 
respondents’ subjective operating movements under various tasks. During the recording, respondents’ subjective 
cognitions are carried out and the facilities are excluded. The only thing needs to be taken care is the operation 
has to be executed on the interface of the screen. 
 
4. Results and Discussions 
4.1 Different Size of Touch Screen Operating Modes 
During imitated operation for three sizes of whole touchscreens, through tabulated statistics, there are no 
significant differences for genders on holding screens. Only when holding small-size touchscreen, sixty percent 
of respondents would operate in vertical styles spontaneously while others use horizontal styles. In addition, with 
the increasing screen size, the operating mode would become horizontal style. In the meanwhile, with the 
holding style of middle-size touchscreen changing into using it on the table, the rate for horizontal holding would 
increase. 
 
4.2 Tasks and Intuitive Operation of Screens 
Delete unidentified data of ambiguous movements and through One-way ANOVA, the findings showed in Table

1. Introduction 
In our daily life, there are a number of tasks that we have to face under faint light or no light condition, 
such as to search a flashlight on the black out situation, or to link connectors on the back or side of a 
computer by hands. On the condition like that, the perception about the surroundings from our sensors 
will be severely affected and certainly the decision of our following actions will be changed. Most of us 
have to use the sense of touch combines with the hearing; smell and taste to explore all of the clues 
surround us, and then vamp up all the information to make a decision for the next action. Facing the 
situation of no light, preexist experience on the task will be a contraposition to us for decision making. 
The subjective impressions for that situations are varied from person to person, and it might be hard to 
study the effects of the preexist thought under such situations. Normally the study about human 
performance can be categorized into two ways of methods, objective and subjective method. 
Researchers mentioned that the objective judgments are considered if they are used to reflect the 
characteristics of an object being judged, and the subjective judgments are made when they are meant 
to reflect the attitudes and preferences of the observer confounded with the object’s characteristics 
(Muckler and Seven, 1992; Gorenflo and Crano, 1989; Olson, Ellis, and Zanna, 1983). In order to 
know better of human performance issues (such as workload; fatigue; comfort; usability; etc.) 
researchers preferred to adapt both methods in order to have the objective evidences and subjective 
opinions from the participants. In most of these works, the objective measures were gathered by timer 
or other proper equipments and the subjective opinions were commonly collected from questionnaires.  
 
There were many researchers concerned with whether subjective and objective measures tell a 
consistent story or not (Wierwille, Rahimi, and Casale, 1985; Derrick, 1988; Rehmann, Stein, and 
Rosenberg, 1983) at the workload issues. And these reports showed that subjective measures of 
workload do not consistently agree with performance-based measures well. Annett (2002) thought that 
with the environment. There are two perception models in the fingers, one is Passive touch, which is 
the subject’s hand is fixed and the object moved to touch the subject’s finger and the subject is asked to 
respond the perception by oral or by other equipment. The other type of touch is the Active touch, 
which the subject actively touch the object and responses. Gibson (1962; 1966) also studied the 
differences between Active touch and Passive touch in his experiment, and they found that these two 
sorts of studies in touch might have the same sensitivity of perception. Lederman (1981; 1983), 
Kennedy (1993; 2003), Morley (1983) and Ekman (1965) observed the effect between the surface 
roughness of objects and the touch performance in a passive linear movement test, they believed that 
active touch was suitable for research applications, because the tactile feeling of object roughness is 
similar both in active touch and passive touch. The active touch is employed in the tasks of linking 
connectors because the sensation of all fingers is needed while one had to find out the direction for the 
connector to plug it into the right socket. 
 
There were two parts of studies in this paper, and each of the two parts preceded a subjective 
questionnaire and an objective experiment. Firstly, the Bother-study was intended to see the differences 
between the subjective view and objective experiment in the issue of linking 8 PC connectors. 
Secondly, the Solution-study was prepared for understanding the differences between the subjective 
view and objective test with 4 proposed designs for the larger bother connectors. 
 
2. Methods and Results 
2.1 Bother-study 
In order to see the bother of the linking tasks, our research team investigated the connectors under the 
current PC specification in the market and found that those 8 connectors (Mini-USB, Mic., PS2, VGA, 
USB-A, USB-B, Net), were frequently mentioned and included in a standard PC. In this Table 1, the 
paired connector and socket has its own way of preventing error-linking. When all of those sockets are 
put together on the backboard of a PC the user might have some bother on linking the paired 
connectors on the right sockets because some of them are similar not only at the shape but also at the 
size. But how much bother are the users felt? And which connector is the most bothered one? To 
understand what users might think of, a simple questionnaire was implemented to gather the subjective 
opinion of users in the Bother-study, and then a PC connector linking experiment was conducted in 
order to get the objective records from users.

After the subjective questionnaires finished, the objective test was conducted for the comparison with 
subjective opinion of users. There were 20 students recruited from the Graduate School of Industrial 
Design in TATUNG University, 10 males and 10 females, they had no injury on their hands and fingers 
reported by them. The subjects were blindfolded and were told to insert the 8 connectors one by one in 
a randomly assigned order into a simulated fixed PC backboard, see Figure 2. In this complete 
balanced experiment, the connector type was the independent variable; the error-linking frequency and 
the linking time were the performance variables recorded by the experimenter with video camera. The 
ANOVA test showed that the mean error-linking frequency among those 8 connectors were 
significantly different, F (7,152) = 5.402, p<0.001, and the LSD showed that the Power connector had 
the largest mean error-linking frequency, (Mini-USB>PS2>others), see Figure 3 (left). At the mean 
linking time, the ANOVA test showed a significant evidence, F (7,152) = 4.297, p<0.001, that the Mini-
USB and PS2 had the largest mean linking time, (Mini-USB, PS2>others), see Figure 3 (right).

study 
 
The objective opinions and the subjective experiment were compared and it was found that the USB-B, 
and PS2 connectors had the largest bother score and the Mini-USB, VGA the second in subjective 
response; and the Mini-USB and PS2 had the largest error-linking frequency and linking time in the 
objective test. In the next Solution-study, the authors decided to take the 4 larger bothersome 
connectors (USB-B, PS2, Mini-USB, and VGA) into account as the solution issue and developed some 
ideas for reducing the bother problem. 
 
2.2 Solution-study 
After several brain storming meetings, our design team decided to propose four ideas for those 4 
bothersome connectors. Take the Mini-USB connector as example, see Table 2. The first idea, Shape-
idea, was to reshape the form of the connector into the shape of its socket. It was supposed that if the 
shape of the Mini-USB connector was designed as a large Mini-USB socket the user might recognize 
Connector type F (3, 532) p-value LSD 
USB-B 34.457 < 0.01 Dot < Hook, Color < Shape 
Mini-USB 5.624 = 0.01 Dot, Color < Hook, Shape 
VGA 32.372 < 0.01 Dot < Color < Hook < Shape 
PS2 24.461 < 0.01 Dot < Color < Hook < Shape 
 
2.2.2 Objective Experiment (2) 
In order to know whether the Dot idea was good for those larger bother connectors in reducing the 
bother of linking, the authors made two types of Dot idea, 1.0 mm and 2.0 mm in different height but in 
the same diameter of 2.0 mm and in the same pitch of 3.0 mm, for those 4 bothered connectors. There 
were 56 subjects (Graduate School students and university students) recruited from the same school, 28 
males and 28 females, and they were asked to link the 8 PC connectors, 4 Connectors x 2 Dot heights, 
in a randomized order. The procedure of this subjective experiment was the same as the experiment in 
the Bother-study, but the sockets were rearranged before each linking task proceeded. Same as the 
experiment before in the Bother-study, the error-linking frequency and the linking time were recorded 
by a digital camera and counted by the experimenter after the tests had finished. The ANOVA test was 
employed to see the differences among the 2 types of Dot idea and among the 4 connectors in each 
measured variable. The result showed that there was no significant difference found at these two 
measured variables between the two Dot ideas. But there were evidences found among these four 
bothered connectors, F (3,444) =32.813, 35.747, p<0.001, at the mean error-linking frequency and 
mean linking time variable, respectively. The PS2 connector had the largest mean value at the two 
variables, and the VGA connector had the lowest ones, Figure 4.

3 Discussions 
The shape and size of the connectors should be discussed to realize why the PS2, Mini USB, USB-B 
and VGA are the larger bother connectors. First of all, among these PC connectors the PS2 is the only 
connector which has round shape that users have to recognize the shape harder for his finger to catch 
the right angle before linking it into PC, so the connector has the largest bother score and larger linking 
time and error-linking frequency. Secondly, the Mini-USB is the smallest one in size that the finger 
could not tell the both sides for directly linking at the first sight. The third one, USB-B connector, has a 
rectangle shape which chamfered at two corners; this connector is thought to be the second bothered 
connector, but it is verified to be a lower bothered connector, see Figure 3. The last bother connector, 
VGA, has a large size and a specific mechanism for the user to link it into the PC socket and luck it on. 
The VGA has a similar situation with the USB-B connector because its bother score is high (subjective 
view) but the two measured variables in objective test are verified to be low. So it is proposed, by these 
results, to categorize the 8 connectors into three levels: the first level is the ‘Good design’ that a 
connecter which in both subjective and objective views is steady given good values, such as the Mic., 
Power, USB-A and Net; the second level is the ‘False design’ which a connecter has the inconsistent 
opinion in subjective and objective views, such as the USB-B and VGA; and the last level is the ‘Bad 
design’ that it is consistently valued to be bad in both views, such as the Mini-USB and PS2 connector. 
This phenomenon might be seen at many products in different designs but it is seldom argued by the 
consumers only because most of users found this kind of bother “several times” after they had already 
bought the product. 
 
Though the four proposed ideas were not produced in this study except the Dot idea for the four most 
bothersome connectors, the subjective view had told the differences among these four ideas. The users 
preferred the Dot idea most and the Colour idea the second, and it seemed that the users wanted to have 
a clearly leading sign for them to catch the idea of insert direction that is the possible reason that these 
two ideas were significantly preferred than the Hook idea and Shape idea. While the Dot idea was most 
effective for the Mini-USB connector, all of the two measured variables were obviously reduced, and it 
also reduced the linking time of the VGA connector but not at its error-linking frequency, but it seemed 
that the Dot idea was not effective to the PS2 and USB-B connector at the error-linking frequency.  
 
4. Conclusion and Suggestion 
Through the Bother-study and the Solution-study each with subjective questionnaire and objective 
experiment in this paper, the authors propose a creative way of reaching much more insight of the 
users’ thoughts. The comparisons between the subjective view and objective view will inspire the 
designers to catch the ‘real’ desire of users and develop a more precise product into the market. In this 
article, 8 PC connectors were survey and 4 ideas for reducing the bother of linking were also verified. 
The most bothersome connectors are the (PS2, Mini-USB, USB-B, and VGA) and the most preferred 
idea is the Dot idea which is to add a number of dots on the major surface of the connector to indicate

Abstract—A resonant backlight inverter with double-ended 
driving and primary-side control are proposed to reduce the 
thermometer effect and leakage current effect in LCD. In this 
paper, the mathematical model of the lamp current including the 
parasitical capacitance in LCD panel is conducted to explore the 
influence of leakage current effect. Moreover, the primary-side 
control and the DPLL function are integrated to form a feedback 
mechanism to track the optimal operating frequency. And then 
the influence of parasitic capacitance can be reduced so as to 
eliminate the leakage current effect. Experimental results agree 
with the theoretical predictions. 
Index Terms—backlight, CCFL, parasitic capacitance, leakage 
current effect, DPLL, primary-side control, double-end driving. 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
Recently, the flat and thin-shape features are the design 
tendencies in display industry [1]. Inside a flat display panel 
(FDP), a backlight module is essential and its performance is 
vital to the display quality of the FDP. Nowadays, cold cathode 
fluorescent lamp (CCFL) is more suitable for large-scale LCD 
panels due to its cost advantage over white LED. Currently, the 
combination of an LCD and a CCFL seems to have attracted 
increasing research topics for thinner FDPs, such as 
piezoelectric transformer (PT) substituted conventional 
transformer [2-4], digital dimming control [5-6], leakage 
current suppression [7-8] and multiple lamp driving [9]. 
Currently, in order to suppress EMI, the LCD is always 
covered with conductive coatings. These conductive coatings 
are connected to the system grounds so that there are 
significant parasitic capacitances occurring between the cables 
and the system grounds. In general, the parasitic capacitances 
cause severe and significant leakage currents along the display 
housing. Consequently, the lamp currents will be absorbed by 
these parasitic currents flowing to the system ground and thus 
obtain a lower efficiency. To overcome the mentioned focal 
point, a backlight module with DPLL function is proposed to 
improve the system efficiency [10]. In this paper, the second-
side resonance technique is applied to compact the module size, 
the complete mathematical model of the lamp current 
concerning the parasitic capacitance is derived and a new 
control scheme is also incorporated to deal with the said 
shortcomings for backlight module. 
II. THE LEAKAGE CURRENT EFFECT AND ANALYSIS OF 
RESONANT INVERTER 
In general, a backlight system is located behind the LCD 
panel with a metal rear plate. There are many parasitic paths 
between cables and metal construction due to the induced 
parasitic capacitances. All parasitic paths will cause that the 
backlight system wastes more energy to maintain desired 
current in the lamp [7]. In order to reduce the leakage current 
phenomenon and to promote the system efficiency, two key 
strategies are adopted in this paper. First, the CCFL is floated 
without connecting with the system ground to remove some of 
the leakage current paths. Then the lamp current can be 
regulated and monitored by the primary-side control directly. 
Next, a DPLL controller is utilized to track the optimal 
operating frequency when the parasitic capacitances influence 
the preset resonant characteristics.

 The main schematic of the employed class D resonant 
inverter is shown in Fig. 1, which is composed of two power 
switches S1 and S2, a boost transformer T1, and a resonant 
capacitor Cr. The equivalent circuit of Fig. 1 is shown in Fig. 
2a, in which the magnetizing inductance Lm of the transformer 
T1 is usually higher than the leakage inductances Lk1 and Lk2 in

III.   DIGITAL PHASE-LOCKED LOOP CONTROLLER 
As mentioned previously, the electrical characteristics of 
backlight module are highly sensitive to the parasitic 
capacitances, which will result in the resonant frequency 
variation and thus significantly influence the system efficiency 
[2]. In this paper, the DPLL technique is applied to track the 
optimal operating frequency to improve the parasitic 
capacitance effect. Fig. 6 depicts the block diagram of a 
typical DPLL controller. The basic structure of a DPLL 
consists of a phase detector, a divide-by-K counter, an 
Increment/Decrement (Inc/Dec) circuit, and a divide-by-N 
counter.

        According to Fig. 6, if the K counter and the Inc/Dec 
circuit both adopt the same timing clock fosc, then their output 
frequencies, fk and fI/D, can be expressed, respectively, as 
follows:

where Kd is the gain of the phase detector, φ is the phase error, 
and k is the modulus of the K counter. By (13), (14) and (15), 
with Kd ×ψ=±1, we can obtain the DPLL’s output frequency

where fs is the selected operating frequency of the backlight 
module. 
 Fig. 7 illustrates the block diagram of the complete 
system configuration, where a sensing resistor Rs incorporates 
the DPLL module to form a primary-side controller as the 
control mechanism. In this scheme, we regulate the lamp 
current by feeding a phase angle of the equivalent input 
impedance Zi on the primary-side of the main circuit. As 
shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, the phase detector captures the 
driving signal of resonant inverter, vcomp, and the sampled 
signal of input current, vsqu, from the shaping circuit so as to 
sense the phase difference of these two signals. The sensed 
phase difference which equals the phase angle of the input 
impedance and vary with the change of environmental 
conditions, and then outputs the signal φ to the K counter, 
which in turn generates periodic pulses with carry or borrow 
indication to regulate the output frequency of Inc/Dec circuit. 
Thus, the output frequency of N counter is adjusted 
immediately to synchronize the output frequency of DPLL and 
hence govern the operating frequency of the inverter.

Consequently, the vcomp and vsqu remain synchronized with a 
fixed phase difference, resulting in the fast tracking of the 
optimal operating frequency of system, and thus reducing the 
leakage current phenomenon as well as enhancing the system 
efficiency. Therefore, the phase difference φ can be fixed to a 
certain value by using the DPLL technique even under the 
perturbation of environmental parameters variation. Since the 
phase angle is selected as the feedback parameter instead of the 
lamp current amplitude, A/D and D/A are not necessary for this 
proposed circuit scheme.

Hor: 2μs/div) 
Fig. 8 shows the comparison of the measured waveforms, 
including vcomp, iin, and ilamp under various control mechanisms. 
First, Fig. 8a indicates the measured results by the traditional 
control. The measured lamp current, which is suffering from 
the parasitic capacitance effect, is merely 3.3mArms. Moreover, 
Fig. 8a displays the phase difference of 33.1 degrees between 
vcomp and the input current iin by using the traditional feedback 
control. The measured phase difference completely agrees 
with the theoretical prediction estimated as (25). Next, when 
the proposed strategy is embedded in the system, the input 
phase angle φ of the resonant tank is down to 24.5 degree 
which is lower than the predicted value as derived in (25) and 
as shown in Fig. 8b. Besides, it is obviously to note that the 
lamp current is also maintained at the rated value of 7.02mA. 
Apparently, the proposed controller can improve the 
parasitical capacitance effect to promote the system efficiency 
and to verify the feasibility and validity of the proposed 
control strategy.  
V.   CONCLUSION 
In this paper, the proposed system scheme integrates the 
primary-side control, the double-ended driving technique, and 
the DPLL controller to reduce the thermometer effect and the 
influence of parasitic capacitance so as to track an optimal 
operating frequency, and thus, to enhance the uniformity of 
backlight luminance, system stability and efficiency. Finally, 
some experiments are used to verify the proposed strategy and 
to demonstrate theoretical predictions.

the tubular CNT-FEL, where the outer glass coated with 
phosphor layer act as the anode, and the inner metal electrode 
is fabricated field emission array to serve as the cathode. There 
is also vacuum state between these two electrodes. Therefore, 
both these two kinds of CNT-FELs obviously possess inherent 
capacitance characteristics due to their geometries. The said 
capacitance characteristics will affect the range of the effective 
field intensity especially in pulse driving; thus, it is still a 
technical choke point so far.  
 
 
Fig. 2 The structure of the used tubular CNT-FEL. 
 
Field emission is one of an optoelectronics mechanism to 
generate visible light. According to the principle of the field 
emission, electrons are emitted from incalculable carbon 
nanotubes when enough electric field intensity is applied to the 
tip of sharp emitters in vacuum. Electrons which are emitted 
from field emission array directly impact and excite the 
phosphor layer on anode to transfer ultraviolet into visible light. 
Because the CNT-FEL need a high voltage or called threshed 
voltage to perform the field emission effect, we can infer that 
the electric characteristics of the CNT-FEL before ignition are 
similar to the zener diodes with the inherent capacitance Ceq. 
Therefore, the equivalent model can be represented as Fig. 3a. 
After ignition, the CNT-FEL possesses capacitance features 
and its lamp current will exponentially rise with the increasing 
lamp voltage, i.e., the lamp current is dependent on the lamp 
voltage. Accordingly, these characteristics can be exhibited by 
Fig. 3b. And we can formulate this relationship as below

III. ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSED PULSE GENERATOR 
The block diagram of the proposed pulse generator is shown 
in Fig. 4, which mainly consists of a flyback converter, a 
energy recovery circuit, and a clamping circuit. In this system, 
the voltage multiplier is used to rectify and to double the AC 
input voltage. And then the flyback converter will generate 
bipolar voltage pulses without capacitance effect by 
incorporating the energy recovery circuit. Next, the clamping 
circuit is used to shift upward the bipolar pulses to output the 
desired unipolar high voltage pulses.

Fig. 6 The simulated waveforms of the proposed pulse generator.
 
In practical design, the excess energy caused by the 
capacitance effect should be transferred to DC bus by an 
energy recovery circuit, which is implemented by another 
winding into the boost transformer and series with a diode. 
Moreover, two-switch topology is employed to share the 
voltage stress as shown in Fig. 5. Besides, the proposed system 
is operated in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) to raise 
the system efficiency. The simulated waveforms of the 
proposed pulse generator are shown in Fig. 6, where the three 
states are described as follows, respectively. 
Mode 1 [t0, t1]: 
The equivalent circuit is depicted as Fig. 7a. Assume the first 
mode begins at t=t0, in this mode, both S1 and S2 are turned on, 
881
According to (14), the equivalent capacitance of the CNT-
FEL is much lower than the clamping capacitor C. This mode 
will be sustained till vlamp=0.

IV. DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
The specifications of the test CNT-FEL used in this paper 
are listed in Table I, where the ignition voltage is about 3.5kV, 
and the lumen value is proportional with the driving voltage. In 
order to achieve the lumen value of 10knits, the amplitude of 
the driving voltage up to 5kV is essential. In practical design, 
we need a boost transformer, whose specifications are shown 
in Table II. In this paper, we select the operating frequency fsw= 
25kHz and the input voltage VDC = 310V. The related design 
considerations are described as follows: 
 
1) Estimate the turns ratio 
In the used high voltage flyback converter, we use two-
transistor topology to share the voltage stress. From the Fig. 5, 
the voltage stress of the power switches can be estimated

By substituting the parameters listed in Table II into (15), we 
obtain n2/n1>3.9. In order to avoid the higher voltage spike to 
destroy power switches, to boost the amplitude of the output 
voltage up to 5kV, and then to operate the energy recovery 
circuit normally, we should select the turns ratio n1: 
n2:n3=1:6:7. 
 
2) Calculate the magnetizing inductance 
Assume the system efficiency η=85%, and the rated power 
of the CNT-FEL is about 10W, thus, the input power=12W is 
required.  The input power of the DCM flyback converter can 
be expressed as

Where (t1-t0)/T can be viewed as the duty cycle D according 
to Fig. 6. To provide enough rest time to reduce the arcing 
phenomenon, the duty cycle D=0.3 is preset in practical design. 
And then substituting D=0.3 into (18), the peak current of the 
magnetizing inductance Ipp=0.26A can be obtained. Besides, 
the operating frequency fsw is chosen the value of 25kHz. 
Finally, we can estimate the magnetizing inductance 
Lm=14.3mH by (17). 
 
3) Determine the clamping capacitor 
In general, the selection of the clamping capacitor should be 
satisfied two requirements as follows 
z 
2
T5RC >>  (19) 
z The rated voltage is higher than a half of the peak 
output voltage. 
From the measured waveforms of the lamp voltage and lamp 
current, the equivalent resistance of CNT-FEL can be 
estimated about 800kΩ. Substitute the given parameters, 
including operating frequency fsw=25kHz, output voltage 
vlamp=5kV, into (19), the required value of the clamping 
capacitor C much higher than 5pF is essential. A capacitor with 
the specification of 2.2nF/3kV is used to both meet these two 
requirements.  
 
V. SIMULATED RESULTS AND EXPERIMENTS  
Before implementing the proposed pulse generator, some 
simulations are performed to verify the feasibility by the 
simulation software IsSpice. According to the mentioned 
specifications and parameters listed in Table II, one of the 
simulation results is depicted as shown in Fig. 8, which is 
almost close to the theoretical predictions. Figs. 9 and 10 
display some measured waveforms, including the control 
signal vgs, the lamp voltage vlamp, the lamp current ilamp, the 
switch current isw, and the 3rd winding current i3 which is the 
current in the energy recovery loop. From these measured 
results, it is obviously that the switch current isw rises linearly 
while the control signal is high, i.e., the switch is on and the 
magnetizing inductance is charged by the DC voltage source 
during this period. At this time interval, the excess energy will 
be transferred as the 3rd winding current i3 and be returned back 
to the DC bus via the energy recovery winding. Moreover, the 
lamp voltage rise to 5kV and maintain a constant level to 
generate lamp current. While the lamp voltage begins to lower 
than the ignition voltage of 3.5kV, the CNT-FEL stops the 
optoelectronics mechanism so as to cease the lamp current. 
And the next phase, the residual energy stored in the CNT-FEL
