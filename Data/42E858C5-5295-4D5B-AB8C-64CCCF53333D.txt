Abstract 
This study evaluates the glovebox gloves and recommends design/selection guidelines to 
offer the desired hand protection against ergonomic-related risk factors without compromising 
hand performances (in terms of grip and key pinch strength and dexterity). Three commercially 
available glovebox gloves, namely butyl, hypalon, and neoprene in 0.015” and 0.03” thickness, 
were evaluated to establish guidelines to minimize the effects on grip and key pinch strength and 
dexterity. The results indicated that the gloved hands decrease grip strength and dexterity. Butyl 
material retains better grip and key pinch strength and dexterity than hypalon and neoprene 
materials. Thin gloves retain better grip and key pinch strength and dexterity compared to thick 
gloves. Based on the results, 0.015” butyl glove is recommended to minimize the effects on grip 
and key pinch strength and dexterity.

2.3 Procedures 
The experiment was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, the basic anthropometric 
measurements including height, weight, and hand dimensions were performed. The second stage 
involved the maximum grip key pinch strength and dexterity measurements.     
Anthropometry Measurements 
The basic anthropometric measurements including height, weight, and hand dimensions 
were performed using tape measure, scale, and digital caliper for each subject. Eighteen hand 
dimensions were measured for each subject following instructions described by Okunribido 
(2000). 
Grip and Key Pinch Strength and dexterity 
Maximum grip and key pinch strength for gloved and bare hand conditions were measured 
for each subject using a Jamar dynamometer and Jamar pinch gauge (Figure 2). Caldwell’s 
regimen (1974) was followed for the estimations of the maximum grip and key pinch strength. 
Three replicates of maximum grip and key pinch strength within 10% tolerance of the mean score 
were recorded. A five minute break was given to each subject after twenty-five minutes test.

The Lafayette Pegboard (Figure 3, Lafayette Instrument Company) was used to evaluate the 
effects of glovebox gloves on hand dexterity. The time required for a subject to place 25 pegs into 
the pegboard was recorded and used to indicate the effects of gloves on wearer dexterity (ASTM 
F2010-00).

material effect show that butyl glove can retain significantly higher (p<0.01) maximum key pinch 
strength than neoprene and hypalon gloves and neoprene glove retain significantly higher 
(p<0.001) maximum key pinch strength than hypalon glove. Thinner (0.015”) gloves retain 
significantly higher maximum grip strength (0.37 kg in mean differences) than the thicker (0.03”) 
glove. For thin gloves, the grip strength seems the same for different glove materials. For thick 
gloves, hypalon material seems to reduce grip strength compared to butyl and neoprene materials. 
3.3 Effects on Dexterity 
The results of the first repeated-measured ANOVA indicate that there are significant 
differences (F=78.30, p<0.001) between glove conditions where the time required for the 
completion of dexterity test for all gloved hands is significantly longer (F=78.30, p<0.001) than 
that of bare hand. The mean time required for the bare hand to complete the pegboard test is 47.7 
seconds (s) where the mean time for the gloved hands to complete the pegboard teat ranges from 
62.4 s for the 0.015” butyl glove to 155.3 s for the 0.03” neoprene glove. 
The results of the second repeated-measured ANOVA show that there are significant 
differences between glove material (F=282.65, p<0.0001) and thickness (F=262.38, p<0.0001). In 
addition, there is a statistically significant interaction effect (F=40.53, p<0.0001) between glove 
material and thickness on dexterity. LSD pairwise comparisons in glove material effect show that 
all three were statistically significant different (p<0.001) where butyl glove can retain 
significantly better dexterity performance than hypalon and neoprene gloves. Thinner (0.015”) 
gloves retain significantly better dexterity performance (-50 s in mean differences) than the thick 
(0.03”) glove. For both thin and thick gloves, hypalon and neoprene materials seem to increase 
the time for completion of pegboard test compared to butyl material. 
 
4.  Discussion and Conclusion 
Based on “minimizing effects” on hand performances criteria, the thickness of the gloves to 
be donned is recommended as 0.015” to minimize grip and key pinch strength degradation and 
retain better dexterity performance. Butyl material could be selected because of the smallest grip 
and key pinch strength degradation with better dexterity performance compared to bare hand if 
other criteria (chemical, physical, biological etc) are met. In general, 0.015” butyl glove is 
recommended to minimize the effects on hand performances in terms of maximum grip and key 
pinch strength and dexterity.

ABSTRACT 
This study evaluates the effects of glovebox glove, layer, and thickness on maximum grip strength 
and contact forces on the palmar skin during simulated tweezers operations. Eleven volunteered 
female comprised the subject pool. Butyl, hypalon, and neoprene gloves in 0.015” and 0.03” 
thicknesses were selected for evaluation. Maximum grip strength and contact forces were measured 
using a Jamar dynamometer and Thin-film force sensing resistors. The results indicated that thinner 
and single layer butyl glove should be used as selection/design considerations to minimize grip 
strength degradation. However, the selection/design considerations of glove material and layer to 
minimize contact forces are contradictory. 
 
Keywords 
Glovebox, glove, grip strength, contact force, tweezers 
handed. The mean values of age, height, hand length and maximum breadth of hand are 32 ± 5 
years (23 to 40 years), 159.7 ± 5.0 cm (152.0 to 169.0 cm), 167.0 ± 5.1 mm (156.5 to 174.6 mm), 
and 87.2 ± 3.8 mm (79.4 to 93.4 mm), respectively. Three 2.5 hours sessions were required for each 
subject to complete all the tests. 
 
Glovebox 
A typical glovebox (Figure 1) used in glovebox applications was adopted in this study. The height 
and width of the glovebox are 3.77 and 0.82 meters. The floor dimensions inside the glovebox are 
0.8 m * 0.8 m. The diameter of the glove port is 20.3 cm. The distance between the centers of the 
two glove ports is 45.7 cm.

Gloves 
Butyl, hypalon and neoprene gloves (Figure 2) in two different thicknesses (0.015” and 0.03”) that 
are commercially available for glovebox use were selected for evaluation. The cuff diameter and 
length of the gloves are 8" and 32". Two hand sizes, 8.5"and 9.75" were provided and the subject 
wore both of the gloves to pick the best fit glove.

Anthropometry measurements 
The basic anthropometric measurements including height, weight, and hand dimensions were 
performed using tape measure, scale, and digital caliper for each subject. Eighteen hand dimensions 
were measured for each subject following instructions described by Okunribido (2000). 
 
Grip Strength 
Maximum grip strength for gloved and bare hand conditions were measured for each subject using a 
Jamar dynamometer. Caldwell’s regimen (1974) was followed for the estimations of the maximum 
grip strength. Three replicates of maximum grip pinch strength within 10% tolerance of the mean 
score were recorded. A five minute break was given to each subject after twenty-five minutes test. 
 
Simulated tasks 
Two FSRs were attached onto the tip of thumb and tip of index finger to determine the contact 
forces of the simulated tweezers tasks conducted inside the glovebox (Figure 5). The subjects were 
instructed to use a pair of tweezers to exert 5, 10, and 15 N force on a strain gauge dynamometer 
constructed at the laboratory using a 5 lbf (22.24 Newton) strain gauge (OMEGA, LCL005). During 
each 10 second sampling period, the subjects were asked to make exertion to reach 25%, 50%, or 
75% of the maximum voluntary force exertions (the target task demand) measured from three 
female subjects in previous study (Liu et al. 2000). Then, hold that force for approximately one 
second. The same procedure was repeated three times. The subjects were also asked to control the 
exertion force/torque to ±10% of the target task demand to minimize the variation of target task 
demand and to ensure the fulfillment of the specific task.

RESULTS 
Effects on grip strength 
Two separate repeated-measured ANOVAs were conducted using maximum grip strength as 
dependent variable since the significances of both the KS and Levene tests were greater than 0.05. 
The first repeated-measured ANVOA indicates that there were significant differences (F=35.88, 
p<0.0001) between glove conditions.  Bonferroni post hoc analyses show that there were 
statistically significant differences for bare hand vs. all gloves, B15 vs. B30, H30, and N30, H15 vs. 
H30 and N30, H30 vs. N15, and N15 vs. N30. The results indicate that mean grip strength for all 
gloved hands is significantly lower (p<0.05) than that of bare hand and the amount of reduction for 
gloved hands compared to bare hand (25.9±2.4 Kg) ranges from 8.8% to 37.8%. 
The second repeated-measured ANOVA (Table 2) show that there were significant differences 
between glove material (F=8.84, p<0.005), thickness (F=104.35, p<0.0001) and layer condition 
(F=305.45, p<0.0001). In addition, there is a statistically significant interaction effect (F=8.99, 
p<0.005) between glove material and thickness on the maximum grip strength. Bonferroni pairwise 
comparisons in glove material effect indicate that the butyl and hypalon gloves can retain 
significantly higher maximum grip strength than the neoprene gloves (p<0.05). In layer effect, the 
results show that more the layers of gloves are worn, the greater the grip strength reduction 
(p<0.0001). In thickness effect, the thinner (0.015”) gloves retain significantly higher maximum 
grip strength (2.3 kg force in mean differences) than the thicker (0.03”) glove. Figure 7 shows the 
plot of Glove Material * Thickness interaction. For thin gloves, the grip strength seems the same for 
different glove materials. For thick gloves, neoprene material seems to reduce grip strength 
compared to butyl and hypalon materials.

tests also show that thinner gloves decreased the contact forces significantly (Z=-2.10, Asymptotic 
Significance<0.05) compared to thicker gloves at the tip of thumb.    
  
DISCUSSION and CONCLUSION 
The means and standard deviations of the maximum grip strength of the bare hand measured in this 
study are consistent with the normative data for female adults ranging from 20 to 44 years old 
reported by Mathiowetz et al (1985). The major finding is that all gloved hand situations impaired 
maximum grip strength significantly compared to the bare hand where the percentage of decrement 
ranging from 8.8% to 37.5%. The results observed on the maximum grip strength are as expected 
and consistent based upon a review of the published literature of industrial gloves. 
To minimize effects of glovebox gloves on maximum grip strength based upon the observations 
made in this experiment, thinner gloves and single layer should be used as selection and design 
considerations to minimize grip strength degradation. In addition, butyl and hypalon gloves should 
be picked over neoprene gloves to minimize the reduction of grip strength if other criteria (chemical, 
physical, biological etc) were met.  
To optimize protection on palmar skin of the hand, neoprene material could be selected to offer 
protection for the tip of thumb with the lowest contact forces recorded. Thinner gloves could be 
used to reduce the contact force at the tip of thumb. In addition, triple layers could be used to lower 
the contact forces at the tip of thumb and index finger. 
To meet both the “minimize effects” and “optimize protection” criteria at the same time, the 
recommended thickness for the design/selection guidelines of gloves is 0.015”. To select glove 
material and layer for immediate use for tweezers tasks, the recommended guidelines based on both 
criteria are contradictory. Butyl and hypalon gloves in single layer format should be picked to meet 
the minimizing effects criterion while neoprene glove in triple layer format could be adopted to 
meet the optimizing protection criterion. Napier (1956) classified the prehensile movements of the 
hand into two discrete patterns: precision grip and power grip. Since precision grip plays greater 
role than power grip during tweezers operations, the grip strength performance could be 
compromised. Therefore, neoprene glove in triple layer format should be adopted as the 
recommended selection guideline for tweezers operations. 
To recommend design guidelines for tweezers operations, “selective protection” principle proposed 
by Muralidhar et al. (1999) could be adopted to meet both criteria at the same time. The butyl could 
be picked as base glove material except at the tip of the thumb where neoprene is favored as base 
material. In addition, one layer of cotton material and one layer of natural rubber material can be 
attached inside the glovebox glove at the tip of the thumb and the tip of index finger regions. 
However, this design recommendation still needs to be validated in advance and the cost for 
manufacturing this glove should be evaluated.
