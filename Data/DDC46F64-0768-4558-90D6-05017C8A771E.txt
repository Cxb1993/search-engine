Abstract 
 
Because Photovoltaic system tends to save 
the energy expenditure across the life span of 
the systems, this paper uses life cycle costing 
and saving-to-investment ratio method to 
construct the renewable energy evaluation 
framework in Taiwan.  The benefits of PVs 
mainly derive from energy cost savings, 
enhanced power quality and reliability, 
reduced environmental emissions, rebates, 
and other incentives. Based on the field data 
of PV-projects located at Taiwan, the paper 
identifies the technical and economic 
parameters of the systems evaluation model. 
The empirical case showed that the 
saving-to-investment ratio of the BIPV 
systems with/without government subsidy is 
all not feasible in Taiwan now. After 
examining critical factors after the 
PVs-project, the sensitivity analysis of the 
future PVs-project was showed. Based on the 
empirical residential case with a reasonable 
PR value, the results of sensibility analysis 
showed that BIPV will become one of the 
 2
  4
energy alternatives. A comparison between 
the present values of life cycle cost (PVLCC) 
of the renewable energy system to the 
traditional system determines whether it is 
cost effective. If the PVLCC is lower than for 
the traditional base case and in other aspects 
is equal, and the project meets the investor’s 
objectives and budget constraints, it is 
considered cost effectiveness and the 
preferred investment [7, 8, 9].  
On the other hand, because of energy 
savings and the carbon dioxide (CO2) 
emissions abatement are the major benefit 
sources of a PVs-project. The present value 
of a PVs-project can be written as

When we evaluate the energy savings of

energy shortage may cause the violent 
fluctuation of the price of energy in the 
future. Considering the rate of energy price 
escalation trend (e) always faster than the 
rate of general price inflation in Taiwan, the 
present value of energy saving can evaluated 
using following equation [10],

Discounted payback period (DPP) 
method calculates the time point which 
accumulated savings net of the accumulated 
cost is sufficient to offset the initial costs. 
The payback year method is essential a 
break-even measure which can be used to 
determine the minimum time a BIPV system 
must last to recover the investment costs. The 
DPP is often used as a rough guide to 
cost-effectiveness. Extending the results to 
the future prospect discussion, the sensitivity 
analysis of the DPP is quite suitable tools.   
 
3. The Critical Factors of Economic 
Feasible for PV Systems 
The analysis of the PVs-projects includes 
choice of parameter value consult domestic 
relevant papers, relevant statistical data from 
the Directorate General of Budget, 
Accounting and Statistics, and relevant 
technical data that every water heater 
manufacturer put forward mainly, and then 
decides after analyzing. First of all, 
consulting PV company data, the life of their 
products is 20 years.  Because the PV 
system is the consuming goods, for the 
general family, the opportunity cost of the 
consuming goods is an income of the fixed 
deposit. Consider the financing behaviour 
characteristic of the general family in Taiwan, 
the paper set the discount rate as 3%.  
The results showed that the present 
value of the opportunity cost larger than the 
present value of the energy savings from 
systems. The net present value of the system 
is negative. Without the government subsidy, 
the SIR of the residential off-grid case 
located at Kao-Hsiung is about 13.7%, with 
  6
3-2. Performance Ratio 
The productivity of PVs-project relative 
to the solar radiation it receives is measure 
by the PR value. Although there are some 
special grid-connected cases demonstrated by 
government showed that PR value greater 
than 80%. In the empirical case of 
“stand-alone type PVs-project”, system 
output will be shut-off after the battery is 
fully charged. According to field data of the 
cases study here, the residential roofing PVs 
showed that the PR value 53.2%, lower than 
the grid-connected case of a Taichung 
Industrial facility 65.5%.  
The low PR value in case of residential 
case located at Kao-Hsiung can be traced to 
the use of stand-alone system. This is 
because of main electricity systems don’t 
provide incentive and good connected 
network support for individual small 
micro-generation now. Also Taiwan just at 
start stage of using PVs as renewable energy, 
and resulting most of the PR values are lower 
than the average value of the systems based 
in London, New York and Los Angeles are 
with a performance ratio of 70%, and the 
average performance ratio of Germany 
longest-term operation data [2, 11, 13]. 
 
3-3. Thermal Issue & Ventilated-BIPV 
BIPV modules are installed on building 
envelope, obviously, the changes of exterior 
environment or climatic conditions will 
affect their total performance. Hot-humidity 
climate in Taiwan always results PV modules 
installed on building envelope are with high 
temperature, and low PR value. Among a 
variety of factors, heat has a direct influence 
on PV. If the temperature of PV is above 25
℃, the effect of temperature arise on solar 
cell efficiency is negative and material 
dependent. For example, the rate of the 
efficiency of crystalline solar cells fall 
increasing temperature, and is estimated 
about 0.4% lower than under STC [15]. In 
contract, the behaviour with diffuse light, 
increased temperature, and shading for 
amorphous showed that achieve a high 
energy yield in kWh per kWp and thus a high 
performance ratio.  
An experiment of ventilated BIPV using 
CFD simulation showed that compare to 
traditional BIPV design, a ventilated BIPV 
saving the energy consumption about 8-26% 
from air condition system. Also a ventilated 
BIPV can provide low solar cell temperature 
and good performance for PV systems. In 
order to ensure the nominal PV efficiency, 
the choice of solar cell material and 
appropriate ventilation thus are necessary. In 
other word, the application of PVs installed 
in buildings must pay attention to ventilation 
and thermal issues, so as to have a better 
energy savings and to maintain a high PR 
value. 
 
3-4. The Benefits from Energy Savings and Price 
escalation rate 
The benefits of renewable energy are 
mainly derived from the saving of traditional 
energy and clean energy environment 
benefits. With LCC, we learn that the 
benefits of renewable energy rely on the 
pricing model of traditional energy. To boost 
their economies, developing countries tend to 
lower the cost of traditional energy to supply 
low-priced energy to industries. In Taiwan, 
the power supply is controlled by a company 
owned by the MOEA, a government-owned 
company. The price of energy tends to be low 
for overall economic development. The price 
does not reflect the real economic cost. This 
result the benefits from renewable energy 
project are relative low. 
The statistic data shows that the past 
upward rate of the price of electricity lie 
between 1 to 2 % in Taiwan, and the upward 
rate of the price of electricity future 
estimated by government is about 2% per 
year. Because LCC is considered with the 
whole life cycle, in a situation that the 
petrochemical energy is limited, the relevant 
prices of electricity and prices of coal gas 
certainly will be going up with time 
constantly in the future. Combing the price 
escalation rate of the electricity energy and 
using the observation of electricity energy 
generated in the first year as the estimation of 
the following lifetime energy savings, the 
illustrative example in the following section 
will analyze the sensitivity of DPP change 
respect to energy price escalation rate 
change.

5. Conclusion  
The benefits of BIPV system mainly derive 
from energy cost savings, enhanced power 
quality and reliability, reduced environmental 
emissions, rebates, and other incentives. The 
paper uses the empirical data and the 
economic evaluation model to explore the 
future of BIPV development in Taiwan. After 
examining critical factors after the 
PVs-project, the sensitivity analysis of the 
future PVs-project was showed. Based on the 
empirical residential case analysis located at 
Kao-Hsiung with a reasonable PR value, the 
results of sensibility analysis showed that 
BIPV will become one of the dominant 
renewable energy in the near future if 
integrating good building design is available. 
With higher escalation rate of electricity 
price and lower discount rate, discounted 
payback years of BIPV systems will less than 
20 years. Adopting ventilated-BIPV will 
lower down the DPP threshold more.
