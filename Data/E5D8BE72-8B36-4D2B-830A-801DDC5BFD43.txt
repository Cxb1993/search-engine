Abstract 
 
The purpose of this paper is to investigate the sound insulation characteristics of honeycomb 
sandwich panels. At first, Biot theory was applied to analyze the waves propagated in 
honeycomb core. Then the transfer matrix for waves propagated between two ends of a single 
panel is established. The matrices of a layered media can be combined in evaluating the sound 
insulation characteristics of a panel. The agreement of the experimental measurements and 
numerical results is good.  It shows that the present method is reliable. Further, the numerical 
investigations reveal that the coincident frequency decreases apparently as the thickness of core 
increases. Thus, the transmission loss is also increased in the analyzed frequency range. Finally, 
the effect of honeycomb core density is also discussed.  
 
Keywords: honeycomb panel, transfer matrix, sound insulation, Biot theory 
 
1. Introduction 
Sandwich structures are widely used materials in industry. In addition to the strength, the 
sound insulation characteristic of sandwich panel structures is also important and has been 
investigated by theoretical analysis or experimental measurements extensively. Kurte and 
Watters [1] initially conducted sound insulation of sandwich composite panels. Ford et al. [2] 
developed a three dimensional formulation for a sandwich panel with a compressible core. 
Moore [3] analyzed the sound insulation of unidirectional sandwich panels with isotropic and 
orthotropic cores. Recently Wang et al. [4] assessed and compared the consistent higher-order 
approach [5] and the two-parameter foundation formulation [6] for the prediction of sound 
transmission loss in unidirectional sandwich panels. They found that for prediction of 
transmission loss of symmetric sandwich panels with an isotropic core, the two-parameter 
foundation model is more convenient, while the consistent higher-order approach is more 
accurate. 
In this work, honeycomb core was regarded as a porous material and Biot theory [7] was 
applied on it to analyze the wave characteristics. And then the transfer matrix for honeycomb 
sandwich panels was established. The predictions of the transmission loss are compared with the 
available experiment data [3, 4]. It shows that the numerical results agree well with the 
experimental measurements. Further, the effects of parameters, such as core thickness, density 
and cell size, are also discussed.

4. Transmission loss 
For a layered media as shown in Fig. 2, the sound wave propagation from A to B can be 
characterized as a series of transfer matrices in layer materials and on the interfaces.

If the surface acoustic normal impedance at A is Za and the right hand side of B is a 
semi-infinite space. Then at points A and B the boundary conditions should be given as follows

where cZ  is the characteristic impedance ( c0ρ ) of the air and tθ  is the transmission angle. Eq.

Thus Za can be obtained by setting the determinant of 'D  equal to zero. Then the reflection 
coefficient can be calculated by 
)cos//()cos/( icaicaa ZZZZR θθ +−=                       (12) 
where iθ  denotes the incident angle of the sound wave. Further, the sound insulation 
characteristic of the honeycomb sandwich panel can also be evaluated. Assume that transmission 
coefficient is )(θτ  and then Eq. (9) can be replaced by

Thus Eq. (11) will be rewritten as

Similarly, the transmission coefficient )(θτ  can also be obtained by setting the determinant of 
"D  equal to zero. If the random incident sound wave is considered, the transmission loss of the 
 6
thickness of the honeycomb core. Four cores of thickness 3/4”, 1.5”, 3”, and 6” are considered. 
The analyzed transmission loss is shown in Fig. 9. It is seen that the transmission loss curves 
seem to shift to lower frequency range as the thickness increases. The coincident frequency also 
reveals the same phenomenon. Owing to the transmission loss increases obviously as the 
frequency higher than the coincident frequency. Thus, the overall sound insulation capacity 
improves as the thickness of the honeycomb-core increases. 
 
Conclusions 
In this study the Biot theory for the waves propagated in a saturated porous material has 
been conducted on the analysis of honeycomb-core. Combining with the transfer matrix method 
the approach is more flexible for the analysis of layered media. The numerical results compared 
with the experimental data of literature reveals that the present method in analyzing the 
honeycomb sandwich panel is available. The parameter study reveals that the coincident 
frequency decreases about from 1000Hz to 100 Hz as the core thickness increases from 3/4” to 
6”. Resulting from this situation the transmission loss is also increased, for some frequency 
region even 10 dB is reached. However, the effects of the core density are different. For 
aluminium honeycomb-core, the transmission loss increases as the density increases that is 
obvious at higher frequency range. However, the coincidence frequency almost does not change. 
For Nomex honeycomb-core which is soft and has lower shear modulus, the coincidence 
frequency decreases from the higher frequency to the main concerned frequency range as the 
core density increases. But when the density increases the shear modulus increases further and 
the sandwich panel become much stiff. Waves propagated in such a panel are similar to those of 
in aluminium honeycomb core panel. So the reduction of the dip frequency will become not so 
obvious.
