ABSTRACT 
In this paper, a simple method to design a compact triple-passband filter is presented. The proposed filter 
structure is mainly composed of two half-wavelength input/output (I/O) terminated microstrip lines and three 
open-loop uniform impedance resonators (UIRs), which are designed for three different passbands. By 
properly selecting the coupling position between I/O open-ended microstrip lines and each desired resonator, 
three passbands can be integrated and the insertion loss can be improved. In order to achieve the compact size, 
the three UIRs are placed on the different layers of the substrate. A filter example operated at 1.575 GHz, 1.8 
GHz, and 2.4 GHz for GPS, GSM, and WLAN applications is designed using the proposed concept and then 
fabricated. Experiment results show a good agreement with the simulated performances. 
Keywords: triple-passband filter, multi-layered substrate.

and middle planes. 
II、DESIGN OF TRI-BAND FILTER 
The three dimensional view of the proposed triple-passband filter is shown in Fig. 1(a) and the layout of 
the top and middle planes for the UIRs is shown Fig. 1(b). The I/O ports are set at the same coplanar side to 
simplify the design. In this structure, the larger (right part) and smaller (left part) open-loop UIRs on the top 
layer are designed for the first and third passbands. The UIR on the middle layer is designed for the second 
passband. The multilayered substrate is constructed by stacking two Duroid 5880 substrate with, a dielectric 
constant εr of 2.2, and a loss tangent of 0.0009. To design the proposed triple-passband filter, the following 
steps are shown as in the Fig. 2: 
 
 
Figure 2. Design process for the triple-passband BPF. 
The strip width and length of the I/O open-ended microstrip lines are set as 1.4 mm and 70.5 mm (x1 = 
-12.12, x2 = -46.52, and x3 = -70.5), having a fundamental passband frequency at 1.575 GHz but the length is 
actually not limited. 
The UIRs on the top layer have the strip width of 1.4 mm and an electrical length around 180˚, since the 
substrate thickness is 1.574 mm. The UIR on the middle layer is designed at center frequency 1.8 GHz of the 
second passband. Nevertheless, it have the different strip width of 0.7 mm with an electrical length of 180˚, 
since the propagation in TEM mode equally. To design the triple-passband filter, the electromagnetic field on 
the I/O open-ended microstrip lines must be analyzed for the optimal coupling with the UIRs. As shown in

open circuit and the stacks of simulated frequency responses for varied positions of the each BPF versus I/O 
lines, which at (a) 1.575, (b) 1.8, and (c) 2.4 GHz. 
 
From previous analysis, the optimal coupling positions versus the I/O microstrip lines are set as -36.22 
mm, -31.06 mm and -59.6 mm for the single BPF1 (BPF2, or BPF3) respectively. Now, three BPFs are 
integrated on the multi-layered substrate first, and then each of BPF is moved solely in order to confirm 
further the power analysis for the optimal performance. The simulated results are depicted in Fig. 4. 
In Fig. 4(a), the BPF1 center is moved solely to the maximum power (-18.11 mm on the I/O microstrip 
lines) and the others are fixed at the supposed optimum position. A cause of the excessive coupling strength 
makes a split mode and a degraded performance comparing with the previous result. However, the other 
passbands are not affected significantly. In Fig. 4(b), the BPF2 center is moved solely to the maximum power 
(-15.53 mm on the I/O microstrip lines) and the others are not modified from original position. In the same 
manner, the excessive coupling strength results a split mode and destroy the passband performance. Fig. 4(c) 
depicts the simulated frequency response of the filter which the BPF3 center is placed at the I/O microstrip 
line left end (i.e., the zero power). The strong coupling strength reduces greatly according to the increasing 
resonant cycles in a finite length. The loose coupling extent on the I/O microstrip line results a passband of 
deteriorated mode. 
Based on above results, a position with the optimal performance can be verified further in the analyzed 
concept of power.

IV、CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, a simple method to design a triple-passband filter using the multi-layered substrate had 
been presented. We discussed the variations of voltages, currents, and powers over the terminated microstrip 
line to verify the optimal position of resonators coupled to the open-ended microstrip line for the desired 
performance. The measured results of the filter example using the proposed design concept have insertion 
losses of 1.71 dB, 1.92 dB, and 2.3 dB, return losses of 21.85 dB, 16.71 dB, and 9.36 dB, and fractional 
bandwidths (FBWs) of 5.3％, 4.6％ and 6.6％ at 1.57 GHz, 1.8 GHz and 2.4 GHz, respectively. By using 
the multi-layered structure, the designed triple-passband had characteristics of high selectivity and low loss, 
and integrated different passbands in a compact size. Moreover, the measured results certified the predicted

Abstract  — In this paper, we presented a design of a triple-
passband filter capable of operating at 1.57 GHz GPS band and 
2.47/3.57 GHz of WiMAX system. The proposed filter mainly 
composes of half-wavelength input/output (I/O) open-end 
microstrip lines, fold stepped impedance resonators, and open-
loop ring unit impedance resonators. By selecting properly the 
coupling position between the I/O lines and the resonators, the 
passband of the tri-band filter can be well created or eliminated. 
Experimental results show a good agreement with the simulated 
results.  
Index Terms —GPS, WiMAX, filter, stepped impedance 
resonator, tri-band. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The rapid tendency in wireless communication systems has 
increased the requirement of integrating multi-transmissible 
channels into a single system. Therefore, modern microwave 
components or devices operating at more than a single 
passband play an important role for the global positioning 
system (GPS), the wireless local area network (WLAN) [1], 
and the wireless metropolitan area network air interface 
(WiMAX) [2]. 
Microstrip circuits are popular structures due to their 
planar configuration and easy integrated procedure, which 
are suitable for commercial applications size. Several 
literatures have been presented in exploring advanced multi-
passband filters [3-6]. For example, split-ring resonator (SRR) 
[3], two quarter-wavelength stepped impedance resonators 
(SIRs) [4-5], are used for a trip-band BPF. However, the 
freedom for modulating passband resonant frequency is poor 
in above researches. 
In this paper, a novel design for a triple-passband filter 
capable of operating at 1.57 GHz GPS band and 2.47/3.57 
GHz WiMAX bands is proposed. The aim of this paper 
focuses on the design and the method of selecting the 
coupling region between resonators and microstrip lines for a 
triple-passband performance. The design procedure is 
presented in the following sections. It is found experimental 
results show a good agreement with the simulated results.

II. DESIGN PROCEDURE 
Fig. 1 illustrates the schematic diagram of the proposed 
triple-passband filter. The filter is mainly composed of half-
wavelength I/O terminated microstrip lines, fold SIRs, and 
open-loop unit impedance resonators (UIRs). The location of 
resonators versus I/O microstrip lines plays an important role 
in the performance of the filter, which decides the cross-
coupling effect between resonators and coupled lines. We 
divide the discussions on them individually as follows. In 
order to control the higher order modes to achieve the dual-
band response, consider the resonant characteristics of the 
SIR as shown in Fig. 2 first. 
The SIR is constructed by cascading a pair high impedance 
sections Z1 with a low impedance section Z2 [7]. The 
impedance ratio K of the low and high impedance sections is 
defined as K = Z2 / Z1. The electrical length ratio α is defined 
as [8]

1.57, 2.46, and 3.47 GHz, along the open-ended terminated 
lines show in fig. 5 (a) and (b). 
It is observed that the power waves must lie at the zero 
point while the magnitude of voltage waves is null along the 
line. They intersect mutually at locations of 12.21 mm, 24.89 
mm, and 31.08 mm as resonating at 1.57 GHz, 2.46 GHz, and 
3.57 GHz, respectively. Therefore, the voltages at the above 
locations are all equal to zero and the resonant mode can be 
well suppressed [10].  
III. RESULT AND DISCUSSION 
Summarily, the optimized positions are around the 
midpoint and l / 4 of the microstrip line for the SIR and the 
UIR. But for the performance and the compactness, the 
structural parameters of the designed filter example at center 
frequency f0 = 1.57 GHz for the first passband are Lp = 49.68 
mm, L1 = 38.65 mm, L2 = 46.37 mm, d1 = 14.42 mm, d2 = 
2.29 mm, d3 = 12.4 mm, s1 = 0.8 mm, s2 = 1.3 mm, g1 = 0.3 
mm, g2 = 0.2 mm, and two feed ports are 2.42 mm wide 
corresponding to a 50 Ω microstrip. The designed filter 
example was fabricated and then measured by an HP8510C 
Network Analyzer. 
Fig. 6(a) shows the photograph of the fabricated layout. 
Fig. 6(b) shows the simulated [11] and measured results of 
the proposed triple-passband filter example using the 
proposed design concept. The whole size of the fabricated 
filter is about 49.68 mm × 31.25 mm, i.e., approximately 0.36 
g by 0.22 g, where g is the guided wavelength at the center 
frequency of the fundamental passband. The measured 
characteristics approximately have insertion losses of 2.6 dB, 
2.6 dB, and 2.4 dB, while return losses are 10.4 dB, 10.9 dB, 
and 8.7 dB at the fundamental, second, and third passbands, 
respectively. The measured fractional bandwidths are 7.1％, 
2.8％, and 3.8％. There is a loss below -35 dB separating 
between adjacent passbands to improve the band isolation. 
Although, the filter has somewhat high insertion losses, and 
that would be attributed to fabrication deviation, the 
conductor and dielectric losses. It is noted that the proposed 
design concept is not limited as the style of fold or open-loop 
ring resonators. Other types for the resonators also can be 
implemented to extend the design freedom as long as 
fulfilling the proposed design concept. Similarly, the length 
of the I/O terminated lines can be modified to achieve a better 
performance, but the compactness will be degraded. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we presented a design of a triple-passband 
filter. We discussed the variations of voltage- and power-
traveling waves on the terminated transmission line to 
investigate the position of resonators versus the terminated 
microstrip line to optimize the performance of the coupling 
effect. Based on the concept, a triple-passband filter capable 
of operating at 1.57 GHz GPS band and 2.47/3.57 GHz of 
WiMAX system is presented. There is a loss below -35 dB 
separating between adjacent passbands to improve the band 
isolation. The measured results verified the predicted results.
