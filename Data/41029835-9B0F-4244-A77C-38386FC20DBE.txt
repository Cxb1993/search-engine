Introduction 
In recent years, growing concerns about environmental issues have demanded more energy efficient nonpolluting 
vehicles. The rapid advances in fuel cell technology and power electronics have enabled the significant developments in 
fuel cell powered electric vehicle. The fuel cells have numerous advantages such as high density current output ability, 
clean electricity generation and high efficiency operation [1-5]. However, the fuel cell characteristics are different from 
that of the traditional chemical-powered battery. The fuel cell output voltage drops quickly when first connected with a 
load and gradually decreases as the output current rises. The fuel cell also lacks energy storage capability. Therefore in 
electric vehicle applications, an auxiliary energy storage device (i.e. lead-acid battery) is always needed for a cold start 
and to absorb the regenerated energy fed back by the electric machine. In addition, a DC/DC converter is also needed to 
draw power from the auxiliary battery to boost the high-voltage bus during vehicle starting. Until the fuel cell voltage 
rises to a level high enough to hold the high-voltage bus, the excess load from the battery will be released. This 
regenerated braking energy can be fed back and stored in the battery using the DC/DC converter. A full-bridge 
bidirectional DC/DC converter, shown in Fig. 1, is considered one of the best choices for these applications [6]. However, 
this system has a complicated configuration, high cost and large size. Several half-bridge based topologies have been 
published in the literature to reduce the device count and increase efficiency [7-10]. A voltage imbalance exists between 
the two split capacitors, thus an additional control circuit to eliminate the voltage imbalance problem is required. In this 
project, a new bidirectional DC/DC converter is presented. The proposed system has the advantages of high efficiency, 
simple circuit and low cost. Isolating the low- and high-voltage sides satisfies the safety requirements. In the following 
sections, the design and operating principles will be discussed in detail. IsSpice simulations are given to confirm the 
theoretical analysis. A reduced scale laboratory prototype was implemented and tested to show the performance. 
 
Fig. 1 The Conventional Full-Bridge Bidirectional DC/DC Converter 
Circuit Operation 
The circuit topology of the proposed bidirectional isolated converter is shown in Fig. 2. According to the power flow 
directions, there are two operation modes for the proposed converter. When power flows from the low-voltage side (LVS) 
to the high-voltage side (HVS), the circuit operates in boost mode to draw energy from the battery. In the other power 
flow direction, the circuit operates in buck mode to recharge the battery from the high-voltage DC bus. Based on the 
symbols and signal polarities introduced in Fig. 2, the theoretical waveforms of the two operation modes are shown in 
Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), respectively.

Although the LVS switches subject to higher voltage stress, this is an advantage because the battery voltage is low. 
Because the overlapping interval for the LVS switches Q1 and Q2 is very short, the LVS transformer current flows 
through only one LVS switch at most time. Thus, the conduction losses for Q1 and Q2 can be greatly reduced to improve 
the conversion efficiency. Moreover, the LVS circuit produces a relatively ripple-free battery current that is desirable for 
the low voltage battery. Assuming that the capacitors Cs and Co are large enough, the voltage ripples on them are 
negligible. The series blocking capacitor Cs will be charged so that the volt-second integral across the transformer 
primary winding is maintained. Thus, the voltage VA across the series blocking capacitor can be expressed as Equation 
(5). The tolerable droop in the capacitor voltage is about 20 percent, so the required capacitor magnitude can be 
calculated simply as Equation (6).

the inductor windings can be also determined as Equations (8) and (9). The inductances of the power inductors L1 and L2

Design Considerations for Key Components 
To verify the feasibility of the proposed scheme, a 100W laboratory prototype operated at 100kHz was built. The 
simulation and experimental results will be shown and discussed in the next section. The LVS of the design example was 
connected to a 12V lead-acid battery whose terminal voltage could swing from 10V to 15V. The nominal voltage on the 
HVS DC bus was designed to 200V, with an operating range from 150V to 400V. The design considerations for the key 
components in the example will be discussed in detail as follows. 
A. Power Switches 
The power switch voltage and current ratings are very important converter design topics. When the duty ratio δ is 
chosen in the operating range of from 0.2 to 0.5, the LVS device rating can be calculated by using Equations (1) to (4) as 
follows:

The circuit topology of the proposed bidirectional isolated converter is shown in Fig. 2. According to the power flow 
directions, there are two operation modes for the proposed converter. When power flows from the low-voltage side (LVS) 
to the high-voltage side (HVS), the circuit operates in boost mode to draw energy from the battery. In the other power 
flow direction, the circuit operates in buck mode to recharge the battery from the high-voltage DC bus. Based on the 
symbols and signal polarities introduced in Fig. 2, the theoretical waveforms of the two operation modes are shown in 
battery voltage. The inductance current, IL1 decreases linearly like the current, IL2. The voltage across the transformer 
winding become zero and the diode Db is reverse-biased. The voltage across the inductor Lr, (VBus-VA) will force the 
inductance current ILr to change its direction at t6. 
Stage 7 (t6~t7): The inductor Lr resonates with Cp3 and Cp4 during this interval. The voltage Vds3 across the HVS switch, 
Q3 continues to decrease to zero at t7. 
Stage 8 (t7~t8): At t7, the inductor currents ILr starts to flow through the body diode D3. As long as the switch Q3 is 
turned on at t8, zero-voltage switching can be assured. The circuit will then proceed back to stage 1 after completing one 
operating cycle Ts. 
Based on the above analysis, the voltage and current stresses of the LVS switches can be found:

where λ(%) is the ripple percentage of the inductor currents, IL1 and IL2. 
The current from the inductor L1 flows through Q2 and the transformer LVS winding, closing the loop via the battery. 
Therefore, the transformer LVS winding carries only -IL1. The current -IL1 increases linearly while -IL2 decreases linearly. 
Since the recharging current, -IBat, is the sum of the two inductor currents, the ripple currents cancel each other to 
produce relatively ripple-free DC current that is desirable for the low-voltage battery. 
Stage 2 (t1~t2): At t1, the LVS switch Q1 is turned on and the HVS switch Q4 is turned off. During this interval, the 
switches Q1 and Q2 are simultaneously on. The recharging current, -IBat, freewheels through both the switches, Q1 and 
Q2. The voltage across L1 also becomes negative and equals the battery voltage. Therefore, the inductance current, IL1 
decreases linearly like the current, IL2. The voltage across the transformer winding becomes zero, the inductor Lr 
resonates with Cp3 and Cp4. The voltage Vds3 across the switch, Q3 continues to decrease to zero at t2. 
Stage 3 (t2~t3): At t2, the currents ILr starts to flow through the body diode D3. As long as the HVS switch Q3 is turned 
on before the inductor current changes its direction at t3, zero-voltage switching can be assured. 
Stage 4 (t3~t4): While the HVS switch, Q3 is zero-voltage turned on, the LVS switch, Q2 is turned off. The resonance 
caused by inductor Lr and the stray transformer winding capacitor could be clamped while the diode, Da is conducted. At 
t4, Da is released because the inductance current -ILr stays at -IL2/n. The stages 5~8 are similar to stages 1~4 respectively. 
The circuit will then proceed back to stage 1 after completing one operating cycle Ts. 
While the LVS switches, Q1 and Q2, share unequal voltage and current stresses, the HVS switches, Q3 and Q4, share 
equal voltage stresses as Equation (12). Then the current stresses of the HVS switches can be found as Equations (13) 
and (14).

Simulation and Experimental Verification 
To verify the theoretical operating principles, a 100W design example was simulated by using IsSpice. Figure 6 
shows the key waveforms in the boost and buck mode operations. There is a good agreement between the simulation 
results and theoretical analysis. In this research, a 100W reduced scale prototype was implemented and tested to evaluate 
the performance of the proposed bidirectional isolated DC/DC converter. Figures 7(a) to (c) show the measured 
waveforms in the boost mode operations for the laboratory prototype. The ripple cancellation between two inductor 
currents can be observed in Figure 7(a). This is desirable for a low-voltage battery. In Figure 7(b), the zero-voltage turn 
on details of the HVS switches Q3 are shown. Figure 7(c) shows the battery voltage, VBat, discharging current, IBat, and 
output voltage on DC bus, VBus. Figures 8(a) to (d) show the measured waveforms in the buck mode operations for the 
laboratory prototype. The waveforms for illustrating the HVS switch Q3 ZVS feature are shown in Figure 8(a). Figure 
8(b) shows the gate signal Vgs3 for the HVS switch Q3 and resonance inductor current ILr. Figure 8(c) depicts the 
experimental waveforms for the battery charging current, IBat, and inductor currents, IL1 and IL2. Ripple cancellation 
between the two inductor currents can be observed. Figure 8(d) shows the input voltage on the DC bus, VBus, battery 
voltage, VBat, and charging current, IBat. Figures 9(a) and (b) show the efficiency comparisons with a conventional 
converter presented in [6] under the load variations in the boost and buck mode operations. Because of the device count 
reduction, higher efficiency can be achieved using the proposed scheme in this paper.
