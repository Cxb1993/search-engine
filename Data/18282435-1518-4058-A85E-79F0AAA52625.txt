examples of test schedule, where test sessions are separated 
by vertical bars.  Each rectangle corresponds to a core 
under test ⎯ the height represents the TAM width while the 
width represents the test time.  The maximum TAM width 
allowed (Wmax) is indicated as dotted lines in the figure.  
Because we adopt IEEE 1500 compatible core wrappers 
[Marinissen 10], the cores under test should be configured 
via WIR chains at the beginning of the test session where 
the cores are tested.  The WIR chain is a scan chain that 
connects wrapper instruction register (WIR) of different 
cores together.

Figure 2.  An example test schedule (a) without 
temperature constraint (b) with temperature constraint 
In this paper, we assume the heat sink is not used in 
production test for cost reduction.  Besides, we only 
consider the steady state temperature in our optimization 
process.  This is because dynamic temperature can settle 
within milliseconds, which is shorter than a test session.  
We assume the temperature of test schedule is only caused 
by the power consumption of cores under test, ignoring the 
power of TSV drivers.   
For our optimization problem, we are given a stack of 
3D IC, which has totally M dies and Wmax test pins.  Since 
we assume the DfT architecture is fixed, the test time of 
each core remain unchanged during the optimization.  
Given an temperature constraint, Tmax, the goal of this 
optimization problem is to find the shortest test schedule of 
the 3D IC under the TAM bandwidth constraint, Wmax.   
3 Proposed Optimization Techniques 
3.1 Overall Flow 
Figure 3 shows the overall flow of the proposed 
optimization technique.  The required inputs to this tool 
are: DfT information, power information, and floorplan 
information of each core in the 3D IC.  DfT information 
includes the number of test pins Wmax, number of scan 
chains for each core, and length of each scan chain.  Power 
information specifies the test power of each core.  
floorplan information specified the 3D coordination (XYZ) 
of each core.   
 
Figure 3.  Overall flow of the proposed technique 
After initialization, cost estimation is performed to 
search several solutions for cost normalization later.  In 
this step, a few random perturbations are performed on 
initial test schedules.  From these random test schedules, 
the averages of costs can be calculated.  Since the ranges 
of the costs used in simulated annealing are different, the 
average of costs can be used to normalize these costs.  
More details about cost normalization will be described in 
section 3.3.   
The next step is thermal-aware test scheduling based 
on simulated annealing.  Section 3.3 gives the full details 
of optimization process.  Because our tool uses a simple 
thermal model, there is a small chance that our optimized 
test schedule could exceed the Tmax.  Once we get an 
optimized test schedule, we have to double check its 
maximum temperature by HotSpot.  If the maximum 
temperature is smaller than Tmax, the process ends; 
otherwise, the same process repeats with a lower Tmax.   
3.2 Thermal Modeling for 3D ICs 
In our proposed optimization, whenever a new test 
schedule is generated, its peak temperature is estimated.  
Peak temperature is the maximum temperature of every test 
session in the test schedule.  Exact thermal simulation is 
very time consuming so a simple 3D IC temperature

100 randomly perturbed test schedules in the cost 
estimation step.   
ETAMs is excessive TAM width of S, ETAMave is the 
average excessive TAM width of 100 randomly perturbed 
test schedules in the cost estimation step.  Figure 8 depicts 
the excessive TAM width, where the shaded rectangles 
represent exceeds the maximum TAM width Wmax.  In a 
test slot i, if the TAM used is no larger than Wmax, ETAMi of 
this slot is equal to zero; otherwise, ETAMi is equal to the 
number of TAM used in this slot minus Wmax.  ETAMs is 
the sum of all ETAMi in every slot of test schedule S.  In 
case ETAMave is zero, it is set to Wmax multiplied by a 
user-defined parameter, which is set to be 0.1 in this paper.

4 Experimental Results 
4.1 3D IC Test Case  
In this paper, we show results of one 3D IC test case, 
which consists of 5 dies, indexed from 0 to 4.  Die 0 is 
placed at the bottom of 3D IC and Die 4 is placed on the top.  
Although there is no heat sink in production test, the heat 
sink will be installed on the top of 3D IC (close to die 4) in 
the system.  Dies are connected by bonding interface.  
The thickness of each die is 50μm and the thickness of 
bonding interface is 2μm.  The thermal resistance of each 
die is 0.01(k×m/W) and that of bonding interface is 
0.25(k×m/W).   
We choose five ITC’02 SOC benchmark circuits in 
this test case.  As most of the benchmark circuits have 
only test length information, we have to assume the other 
information: area, power, and floorplan.  The area of each 
core is computed by the summation of input pins, output 
pins, and scan cells, multiplied by an area density, 3.18x10-4 
(mm2/number), which is obtained by average synthesis 
results of TSMC 180nm technology.  The test power is 
computed by the power density, 1.4 (W/mm2), multiplied by 
the core area.  Once we get the area and power 
information of each core, the floorplan of each die can be 
generated using the tool HotFloorplan [Skadron 04].   
Table I shows information of the 3D IC test case.  
The third column is the total area of each die.  The last 
column is the total test power consumption of each die.  
We stack dies in increasing order of their die power, from 
the bottom up.

The ambient temperature is set to 25oC.  The ambient 
resistance models the interface of 3D IC and the ambient 
environment.  This parameter is decided by the package.  
In our experiment, we set it to 4 (oC/W), assuming a 
medium priced package.  Users can change these 
parameters according to different situations.  In addition, 
we have to add the temperature constraint to our 
optimization process.  For our experiment, we set it to 
90oC, which is the same as other papers in 2D IC test 
scheduling.   
4.2 Experimental Results 
In our experiments, we compare our thermal-aware 
test scheduling method with a temperature-unaware test 
scheduling method.  The latter is implemented in the same 
way as the former with a very large Tmax.  Table II shows 
the optimization results of test time and maximum 
temperature.  The second column shows the maximum 
TAM width (Wmax) for each test case.  The third and forth 
columns are the test length and maximum temperature for 
the thermal-unaware test scheduling.  The fifth and sixth 
columns show the corresponding results of our 
thermal-aware technique.  The last column is the test time 
overhead of our proposed thermal-aware technique with

For this case, the test time of thermal-unaware test 
scheduling method is shorter than that of our proposed 
technique.  The total test time of our technique is about 
19% longer than thermal-unaware scheduling.  However, 
maximum temperatures using thermal-unaware method 
exceed the temperature limit (90oC).  Without thermal 
consideration, these 3D IC could fail the test due to over 
heating.  The experimental results show the importance of 
thermal-aware test scheduling for 3D IC.   
Table III compares the maximum temperature of our 
thermal-resistance model and Hotspot simulation results.  
The second column is the maximum temperature simulated 
by HotSpot and the third column is the maximum 
temperature obtained by our proposed model.  The last 
column shows the error between these two temperatures.  
The difference of temperature between our proposed thermal 
model and HotSpot is very small.  The maximum error is 
just below 2%.

5 Conclusion  
A thermal-aware test scheduling technique for 3D IC is 
proposed in this paper.  We use a simplified 
thermal-resistance model to quickly estimate the temperature 
of a test schedule without simulation.  Our proposed 
technique can generate a test schedule of which the 
maximum temperature is under Tmax.  Besides, the test time 
of our thermal-aware test scheduling is only about 19% 
longer than that of thermal-unaware method.  The 
difference of temperature between our proposed thermal 
model and HotSpot is below 2%.
