Abstract 
This project developed artificial eyes for the applications of intelligent robotics.  The 
developed artificial eye is an intelligent imaging system inspired by the structure of human eye.  
This imaging system consists of a CMOS image sensor array and an adaptive optical system. The 
pupil and lens of the optical system can be in-vivo adjusted as human eye does.  It is also 
flexible as human eye to be easily implemented on humanoid robots. This optical system will be 
miniaturized using the technology of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).  The COMS 
image sensor array detects images through the optical system.  An embedded system will be 
developed for image recognition and feedback control of the optical system.  This project is 
multidisciplinary.  It integrates the domain knowledge from solid mechanics, microfluidics, 
polymer physics, optics, micromachining, information science, control, semiconductor physics, 
and robotics. 
    Through the first year of this project, we have been able to optimize the structural design 
and microfabrication to obtain the highest tuning ratio of the lens and pupil. To meet the 
dimension specifications, the mechanism to drive the hydrogel has been switched from solution 
stimuli to electrostatic field in the second year of the project. The change of the driving 
mechanism is to simplify the microsystem and driving signals so as to facilitate system 
integration of intelligent robots. The CMOS image sensor array has been integrated with the 
robot mechanism in the third year of the project. The system has been tested, and an embedded 
system has been used for image analysis as well as to control the driving signal of the optical 
system.

 To 
displace or to deform a lens for tuning the focus lens, the actuators utilizing piezoelectricity, 
electrostatics, and electromagnetic have been developed, respectively.
12,13,14,15,16,17
 Complex 
mechanisms were usually required to facilitate the actuation. Electrowetting has also been 
utilized to change the surface curvature of a liquid lens.

 Response delay due to fluid 
viscosity and wetting hysteresis remain to be investigated. The anisotropic reflective index of 
liquid crystal was also applied in tunable lenses.

 Temperature stability and 
transmittance subjected to polarization are to be resolved. In the attempt to develop a compact 
tunable lens with simple driving mechanism and high temperature stability, a liquid lens which 
can be deformed using a dielectric elastomer actuator has been developed in this subproject. The 
liquid lens also serves as the ionic electrode of the actuator for device simplification and 
transmittance enhancement. 
The surgical implantation of artificial iris-lens diaphragm in patients with anatomic or 
functional iris deficiencies are nearly mature and successful.

    The dimension of the proposed artificial iris is designed so that the fabricated device is 
suitable for modulating light intensity of humanoid vision. Specifically, the diameter of human 
iris changes from 1.5 mm to 8.0 mm.
40,41
 The proposed artificial iris has been fabricated on 
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate so that the device could be flexible. Micromachining 
techniques were used to fabricate the device. The design and fabrication of the artificial iris will 
be detailed in this report. A control circuit with a photodiode to detect the ambient light has been 
developed and integrated with the artificial iris. The fabricated artificial iris has been 
demonstrated and tested. And the function of the integrated system has been verified. 
 
2. Humanoid Eye Robot with Angle Control and Image Registration 
 
The eye mechanism was made with humanoid size and designed to imitate humanoid motions 
of eyeballs and eyelids. The mechanism can be used as the visual system in 1:1 humanoid robot. 
There were five servo motors in the eye robot mechanism, each of which stood for a degree of 
freedom, as shown in Fig. 2. Moreover, two miniature cameras and two angle gauges were 
installed underneath the eyeballs for facilitating the feedback control of the horizontal rotation, 
which helped us to obtain a more precise rotation angle. 
 
Figure 2. Design of the eye mechanism with five degrees of freedom. 
 
2.1 Servo Motors and Transmission 
The eye robot with five degrees of freedom in this subproject is illustrated in Fig. 2. Each 
eyelid connected through three linkages to a motor so that it can rotate upwards and downwards. 
These two eyelids possessed two degrees of freedom in total. For human eyeballs, the horizontal 
rotation of the two eyeballs can be conducted independently while the vertical rotation cannot. In 
other words, cross-eye is possible for human and the vertical rotation for the two eyes are 
synchronous. Accordingly, the eye robot in this subproject controlled the vertical rotation of the 
two eyeballs simultaneously with slide tracks and vertical bars which transmitted power from 
servo motor to the eyeballs. The horizontal rotation of the eyeballs possessed two degrees of 
freedom in total, and the vertical rotation possessed one only.

replaced if needed. The angle gauge used in this subproject is MTS-360 with the low linearity 
error of ±0.5%. MTS-360 is produced by Piher International Corporation, and it was connected to 
the host PC through Arduino-Nano surface mount board integrated with an USB interface. 
Miniature cameras with CCD chips were attached on the eyeballs and connected to the host PC 
through the USB interface. The miniature camera used in this subproject is CM-51 from Mega 
System Technologies Inc. It has 1.3 mega-pixels.  
Figure 4 expresses the whole flowchart of the system control. This design proposed to use 
regions as corresponded units, which substituted for points-points correspondence for increasing 
the operational speed and reducing the deficiency of view data. The shapes and colors of those 
regions which were separated from camera images are useful information for the system to 
extract suitable features. Those features were considered as the basis of image correspondence. 
Then the result and current viewpoint of the eyeballs could help to calculate all 3D distances of 
corresponding region pairs. 
To demonstrate the system functionalities, the driving program rotated the eyeballs in parallel 
to the direction of the nearest detected object, and the calculated 3D-distance of this object was 
displayed in a monitor. The neck rotations were also helpful when the eye mechanism reached its 
rotation limit. The planar projection of the vision boundaries was also displayed in the monitor. 
The monitor displayed the processed images from both eyes, as shown in Fig. 5. 
 
Figure 5. Demonstration mechanism and presentation. The larger window in the left hand side of the monitor shows 
the result of the distance measurement to the nearest object. It also shows the boundaries of the nearest object 
projected on the left camera. The six windows in the right hand side of the monitor shows the original images, 
segmented images and corresponded images, respectively from top to bottom. The three images on the left column of 
these six images express the images of the left eye. The yellow circles in the bottom windows indicate the nearest 
object. 
 
2.3 Materials and Fabrication Process 
The eye robot is mainly made of acrylic which has the advantages of light weight and high 
stiffness. The light weight is an essential merit in the overview of developing a complete 
humanoid robot. The acrylic components of the eye robot are manufactured using the 
combination of laser machining and CNC milling. Laser machining is a two-dimensional cutting 
method which can make simple components faster than CNC milling. Conversely, three 
dimensional components with relatively higher precision can be obtained using the CNC milling.

0T T    for forward rotation; 
       0T T    for reverse rotation.  (1) 
As shown in Fig. 8, when the rotation angle is over the expected value, the backlash angle 
between two gears should be considered in order to arrive T=D. The backlash angle varies from 
the errors resulting from the assembly process. Therefore, it has to be verified through experiment 
after the eye robot is assembled. To avoid the infinite feedback control loops due to that the angle 
oscillates within a specified range, a loop count, C=10, is set to terminate the feedback loop.

2.5 Image Registration Algorithm 
A. Formal statement of camera parameter and pinhole model 
An image from a pinhole camera represents the projection from a three-dimensional coordinate 
point P(x,y,z)
T
 to a point P’(u,v)T in the two-dimensional projective plane (or so-called imaging 
plane), as shown in Fig. 9.
42
 The two coordinates are transferred into homogeneous coordinates 
by adding 1 as the last element of the matrices. Thus the augmented matrices become 
( , , ,1)TP X Y Z , and ' ( , ,1)TP u v , respectively. The projection can be characterized by parameters 
of the miniature camera which include the intrinsic parameter matrix, K, and the extrinsic 
parameter matrix, [R|t]. The most general form of K is

where fx 
and fy is the scaling factor of the x and y axes, respectively. fx and fy are usually called 
focal length, or focus. The coordinate (u0,v0) is the point of reference, usually located in the

of the camera and the proper rotating angle, α, are known. 
 
B. Finding point of interest in image 
A good choice of the comparison point, uk’, plays an important role in realizing image 
registration in this work. It should be noted that the camera on the robot has the vision angle of 
50
o
. If the comparison point were chosen too close to the boundary of the image, it would become 
out of the vision field when the eyeball rotates. Therefore, one-fifth of the field size is excluded 
from each edge of the image for the following processing. To prevent the comparison points from 
being confused with each other, the remaining image is then divided into 3 by 3 portions. One of 
the most representative points in each portion is chosen as the point of interest for comparison. 
Such points are usually referred to as corner points. 
Many methods have been used to find the corner points in an image field. The most widely 
used and efficient way is the Harris method.
44
 However, this method is built on gray scale 
images. If the gray level does not have a considerable change, this method cannot perform as 
good as expected. Therefore, the corner points are defined in a color image in this work. If there 
are two or three adjacent points of the same color with the center pixel in the neighborhood 3x3 
pixels, this center point is recognized as a corner point, as illustrated in Fig. 11. 
 
Figure 11. Definition of corner points in a color image. The gray pixels denote the same color with the center pixel 
while the black pixels have different colors. 
 
C. Example of image registration 
Two images are taken, respectively, before and after the rotation of angle α of the robot. By 
using the pinhole model, the estimated positions in the rotated imaging plane of the original 
corner points can be acquired. Then some approximate angles, αk, which are uniformly spaced in 
the region of [α+2, α-2] with 0.1o interval are chosen. Thus there are 39 estimated αk’s and 39 
estimated locations of uk’ in the new imaging plane. For each uk’, the R-G-B color difference of 
55 neighborhood pixels are compared with the u’ in the rotated image. When uk’ approaches u’, 
their color difference would be very small and the point corresponding to the minimum of color 
difference function would denote the actual rotating angle. 
The color difference function represents the color difference in the 55 neighborhood pixels 
surrounding each corner point ui’. Thus its mathematic form can be written as

carried out. The rotation angles acquired from the feedback control and image registration are 
compared with the computer assigned angle from SSC-32. 
 
Figure 14.  Geometric measurement of the rotation angle 
 
A. Procedure of experiment 
Two objects, A and B, in the captured image are defined. Object A is fixed as an orientation 
reference, and object B is the target of angle tracking which is placed arbitrarily in the visible 
range of miniature camera, as shown in Fig. 14. 
The horizontal angle of the eye robot is set to zero firstly. At this step, the eye robot looks 
straight forward. Then the object A is placed and adjusted right in front of the robot eye. 
Specifically, the robot is adjusted so that the position of the object A coincides with the central 
line of image field. For a 320240 bit-map picture, the object A is aligned with the 160th pixel 
column from the left. 
The distance from the object A to the miniature camera in the robot eye is measured. It is 
considered as an unchanged reference length. Then the angle gauge readout and the image taken 
by the camera before rotation are recorded. 
Next, the eyeball is rotated to aim at the object B. Similarly, the object B should align with the 
central pixel column in the image field. The angle gauge readout is then recorded, and the rotated 
image is captured again. Meanwhile, the distance between the object B and the camera CCD is 
measured. The distance between the object A and the object B is also recorded. 
For the geometric method, θ in Fig. 14 can be derived from law of cosines. After the 
calibration of the scaling factor of the angle gauge by sets of θ’s from the geometric method, the 
angle gauge readout can be obtained. The SSC-32 board returns the angle directly. For the 
method of image registration, searching of the corner points and color difference comparison are 
utilized to obtain θ, as detailed earlier. 
The position of the object B is arbitrarily changed for several times, and the rotation and 
recording procedure mentioned above are repeated. Accordingly, several sets of data are obtained 
for the following analysis and discussion. 
 
15 
gauge readout is shown in Fig. 16. The regression line in the figure has the slope of 1.02, the 
intercept of 0.15, and the correlation coefficient of 0.9999. This indicates that the gauge value and 
result obtained using image registration have high correlation. 
The angle values obtained from the angle gauge with the calibrated scaling factor is the 
reference value, and the error of the image registration is evaluated. As shown in Fig. 17, the 
error of the image registration is ~0.5
o
 while SSC-32 input has relatively larger error of ~3
o
.

2.7 Conclusions 
An eye robot with five degrees of freedom has been designed and manufactured in this work. 
The dimension and motion of the mechanism imitated human eyes for the development of a 
humanoid robot. A feedback control algorithm has been developed to precisely control the 
horizontal rotation of the eyeballs. Four different methods to evaluate the rotation angle of the 
eyeballs have been compared through a series of experiment. The results indicated that the error 
of the rotation angle can be controlled under 0.6
o
 using image registration. Hence the error due to 
the angle gauge and the mechanism backlash can be effectively suppressed.

3.1 Related Work 
In this section, the CIELAB color space is briefly reviewed and a comprehensive overview of 
the clustering methods is given. After a brief review of the standard k-means clustering algorithm, 
the shortcomings of the k-means clustering algorithm are discussed. 
 
A. CIELAB Color Space 
It is different from the RGB and CMYK color models that CIELAB is designed to be closer to 
human vision. In addition, it shows better uniform color space than others. The value of the 
Euclidean distance for two colors represents the chromatic aberration. For the characteristics of 
the color reacting to the human vision, the color are translated into distinctions between light and 
dark, magenta and green, and blue and yellow. Thus CIELAB is an opponent color system that 
indicates these values with three axes: L*, a*, and b*. As shown in Fig. 18, the central vertical 
axis, denoted as L*, represents the lightness. Its values run from 0 to 100. The zero value 
represents black while the 100 value indicates white. The other two orthogonal axes, a* and b*, 
are based on the fact that a color cannot be simultaneously magenta and green or blue and yellow 
due to complementary principle. For both a* and b* axes, the values run from negative to 
positive. In the a* axis, negative values indicate green whereas positive values indicate magenta. 
In the b* axis, negative values indicate blue whereas positive values indicate yellow. In each axis, 
zero shows neutral gray.

the initial step will generate a much faster convergence and preferable result. K-means is quite 
sensitive to initialization.
51
 Large and high-dimensional data sets will make the computation 
time-consuming. 
 
Figure 19. Flow chart of the standard k-means clustering algorithm. (A, B, C) is the color of pixel at the image 
coordinates (x, y), and Ni is the total number of the cluster i. 
 
3.2 New Algorithm 
The new data preprocessing method proposed is to improve the problem of initialization and 
computation time mentioned in the previous section. The new algorithm processes the data first 
and then carries out the k-means clustering, as illustrated in Fig. 20. The data preprocessing can 
be divided into data simplified, sample weighting, initialization, and center mergence. 
 
A. Data Simplification and Sample Weighting 
In a color image, each pixel has three dimensions of color information. However, the pixels of 
the image may have the same color information. In other words, there are many redundant 
computations when processing the k-means clustering with a color image.
50
 Some images are 
tested in this report, as shown in Figs. 21(a)-(f). The image of the baboon possesses 320 x 320 
                                                 
51 R. Maitra, “Initializing Partition-Optimization Algorithms,” IEEE / ACM Trans. Comput. Biol. Bioinf., vol. 6, pp. 144–157, 2009. 
21 
A data simplification method, which remains the results of the clustering but dramatically 
increases the percentages of the redundant colors, is proposed in this report. The computation 
time of k-means clustering can be significantly reduced. The main idea is that a small amount of 
the chromatic aberration causes ignorable difference to the human vision. In the image process, 
the color values of each pixel are divided by a parameter first. The results are real numbers and 
mapped to the largest previous integer. Then the resultant integer is multiplied by the parameter. 
The images given in Fig. 21 are tested again and compared with the results of the original ones. 
The processed images are hard to distinguish from the original ones, but the percentages of the 
unique colors are dramatically increased. The image of the baboon with 18977 unique colors has 
81.47% redundant colors. The image of the lady with 6208 unique colors has 93.94% redundant 
colors. The image of the airplane with 5176 unique colors has 94.95% redundant colors. The 
image in Fig. 21(d) with 12835 unique colors has 83.29% redundant colors. The image in Fig. 
21(e) with 8122 unique colors possesses 89.42% redundant colors. The image in Fig. 21(f) with 
11018 unique colors has 85.65% redundant colors. The percentages of the redundant colors 
indicate the unnecessary computation time of the k-means clustering, which could be reduced by 
the sample weighting step. The experimental results and discussions are showed in the next 
sections.

of the clustering is about 6-10 times. It is much less than that without the data preprocessing. 
Therefore, it is one of the main reasons that the computation time of the k-means clustering can 
be reduced.

The focal length decreases with the increasing bias voltage in a quadratic manner. However, 
higher plate rigidity and thicker plate will suppress the effectiveness of the bias voltage. 
 
4.2 Device Design 
The schematic of the tunable lens is shown in Fig. 26. The tunable lens is simply made of the 
proposed dielectric elatomer actuator which covers an acrylic holder. The liquid lens is contained 
by the acrylic holder. NaCl solution is used as the liquid lens. Accordingly, the fabrication process 
is simple and low cost. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is used as the elastomer layer in the 
actuator. PDMS has high dielectric constant and is transparent to visible light. A thin gold layer is 
deposited on top of the PDMS to serve as the electrode. It has good conductivity and ductility. 
The NaCl liquid lens serves as the bottom electrode for its electrical conductivity, optical 
transparency, and low cost. The NaCl solution is conductive due to mobile ions. Therefore, 
saturated NaCl solution is used in this work to obtain the most mobile ions and hence the lowest 
resistance.  Acrylic sheet is light, cheap and easy to fabricate. The acrylic holder is fabricated to 
clamp the circumference of the PDMS layer. It also has a chamber with a microchannel which 
allows the flow of the NaCl solution.  
Copper tapes are embedded in the laminated acrylic sheet to provide electric interconnection, 
as shown in Fig. 27(a). The bias voltage is applied through the copper tapes. The hydrostatic 
pressure of the NaCl solution will force the PDMS plate to curve. The initially curved shape 
eases the tuning mechanism without reaching the critical radial compression for buckling a flat 
plate. When a bias voltage is applied across the thickness the PDMS plate, the electrostatic force 
acting on the electrodes squeezes the PDMS. The circumference of the PDMS plate is clamped so 
that the radial expansion of the plate is not allowed. Therefore, the center of the PDMS plate 
uplifts, shortening the radius of curvature and focal length of the liquid lens as shown in Fig. 
27(b). The outmost dimension of the tunable lens, including the acrylic holder, is 15 mm in width, 
29 
inject the NaCl solution to be the liquid lens. The bottom acrylic sheet was a rectangular plate 
without any pattern. The plate was 15 mm in width and 20 mm in length. These three acrylic 
sheets were attached together using waterproof glue. 
The process to fabricate the dielectric elastomer actuator is shown in Figs. 28(b)~(i). The 
substrate was made of glass. Before the fabrication process, the substrate was cleaned using 
acetone and then rinsed using isopropanol alcohol and deionized water, respectively. After the 
rinse, the substrate was dried using nitrogen flow and then based at 70
o
C on a hot plate to totally 
remove the water residues. The photoresist, AZP4620, was spun coated onto the cleaned substrate 
with the spin rate of 1500 rpm, as shown in Fig. 28(b). It served as the sacrificial layer to release 
the PDMS plate later on. The photoresist was soft-baked at 95
o
C for 5 minutes on a hot plate. 
PDMS (Sylgard®  184, Dow Corning Corp.) was spun onto the photoresist at 3000 rpm. Its 
thickness was 25 μm. The weight ratio of the PDMS prepolymer and curing agent was 10:1. The 
Young’s modulus of the PDMS can be changed by using different ratios of the curing agent. The 
PDMS prepolymer and the curing agent were stir-mixed and then degassed in a vacuum chamber. 
The mixture was cured at 90
o
C for 5 minutes on a hot plate after it was spun onto the photoresist, 
as shown in Fig. 28(c). 
After the PDMS was cured, acetone was used to remove the photoresist so that the PDMS 
plate was released. The PDMS plate floated on the acetone at this step, as illustrated in Fig. 28(d). 
Due to the surface tension of the acetone, the PDMS plate remained flat without any wrinkle. The 
top acrylic sheet was used to hold the PDMS plate until the acetone completely dried out. The 
PDMS plate was suspended in air at this step, as shown in Fig. 28(e). Then a gold layer of 5 nm 
was sputtered on top of the PDMS plate. An acrylic shadow mask was used to define the gold 
pattern, as shown in Fig. 28(f). The copper tapes were applied to provide the electric interconnect, 
as shown in Fig. 28(g). Then the bottom acrylic sheet was bonded, as shown in Fig. 28(h). Finally, 
the NaCl solution was injected into the chamber to curve the PDMS plate, as shown in Fig. 28(i). 
The concentration of the NaCl solution was 3.6:10 of NaCl to deionized water in weight. The 
resistance of the NaCl solution was measured to be 30 kΩ for a droplet of 1 cm in diameter. The 
completed tunable lens was coated with parylene to seal the NaCl solution and to prevent any 
leakage. The photograph of the fabricated tunable lens is shown in Fig. 28(j). The lens remained 
transparent after the gold was deposited.

point. The measured focal length under different bias voltage is denoted as the square dots in Fig. 
32. For the bias voltage increasing from 0 V to 900 V at 100 V increment, the focal length 
decreased from 15.8 mm to 13 mm. 
The second method to determine the focal length was to measure the lateral profile of the 
tunable lens under different bias voltages. The radius of curvature of the lens was then extracted 
through image processing. Its value under different bias voltage is given in Fig. 33. By applying 
the lens maker’s formula given in Eq. (23), the focal length was obtained. The lateral profiles of 
the tunable lens under the bias voltages of 0 V and 900 V, respectively, are shown in Fig 10. The 
lens height increased by 51 µm or 25% when the bias voltage increased to 900 V, implying the 
shortening of the focal length. The extracted focal length under different bias voltages is also 
shown as the triangular dots in Fig. 32. For the bias voltage increasing from 0 V to 900 V at 100 
V increment, the focal length decreased from 16.3 mm to 13.3 mm. The error bars in Fig. 32 
represent the standard deviation of five tests. The focal length of the fabricated lens can be tuned 
by 3 mm with high accuracy.

the total process is increased at least 10 times. But it still remains the performance of image 
segmentation. It is a very practical application in many cases, particularly, in the digital visual 
system based on real-time operation. 
As for the tunable micro-lens, both measurement methods obtained approximately 3 mm 
change of the focal length for the bias voltage increasing from 0 V to 900 V. There is ~0.2 mm 
deviation of the focal length between these two methods. Practically, the method using 
microscope might have produced more measurement error due to the image justification. Based 
on the modeling results, the surface profile of the liquid lens was not spherical, which leaded to 
image distortion. The image distortion made it difficult for human eyes to justify whether the 
center of the image has been focused under microscope. Comparatively, the method by measuring 
the lateral profile of the liquid lens gave more accurate results because the lens profile can be 
captured by the CCD camera with high resolution and then enlarged.  
For the both measurement methods, the focal length decreased quadratically with the bias 
voltage. For zero bias voltage and the focal length of 16.3 mm, the hydrostatic pressure caused by 
the liquid lens was 1.13 Pa over the atmospheric pressure. The micromachined artificial iris and 
tunable lens will be implemented into the humanoid eye robot for advanced vision improvement 
in the near future.

through the three years of this project. Among the published or accepted papers, eight appears

research outcomes in this category are listed below. 
 
6.1.1 Top Journal - Y.-J. Chen, W.-P. Shih, C.-K. Kao, and P.-Z. Chang, “Design and fabrication 
of a tunable superconductive resonator utilizing micromachined tunable capacitor,” Journal of 
Microelectromechanical Systems, Vol. 19, pp. 129-136, 2010 (SCI, IF=2.226; 6/105 in 
ENGINEERING, MECHANICAL) 
    This paper presents the design, fabrication and characterizations of a flip-chip bonded 
micromachined capacitor for tuning a high temperature superconductive resonator. The major 
issue of the tunable superconductive resonator is its high driving voltage due to accumulated 
thermal stresses and the poor compatibility between the fabrication process and the 
superconductor material. The tunable capacitor in the form of a micro-bridge with flexible 
boundaries is proposed to reduce the thermal stress. The thermal stress is reduced to 10MPa, 
and the pull-in voltage of the capacitor is 25V. The micromachined capacitor and the 
superconductive resonator are fabricated separately and then integrated together by using 
flip-chip bonding technique. This integration method prevents the superconductor material 
from high-temperature process. At 75K operation temperature, the measured center frequency 
of the fabricated tunable resonator changes from 2.93GHz to 2.87GHz when the driving 
voltage increases from 0V to 40V.

INSTRUMENTS & INSTRUMENTATION) 
A fracture mechanics approach is used to determine the critical fluid pressure needed to 
debond the interface ahead of a microchannel which is fabricated by wafer bonding techniques.  
The relation between the effective bonding energy of the wafer bonding interface and the 
critical pressure is given in closed form.  Detailed finite element simulations are carried out to 
verify our analytical model.  Our analysis shows that energy release rate computed using 
beam theory can be considerably lower than the actual release rate.  The critical pressure of 
polydimethysiloxane (PDMS)/silicon microchannels was also determined by experiments.  
Using our analytical model, the effective bonding energy was obtained at different partial 
curing temperatures.  For example, the maximum effective bonding energy is found to be 1.48

6.1.5 Top Journal - T.-E. Tsai, G.-W. Wu, C.-C. Chang, W.-P. Shih, and S.-L. Chen*, ”Dynamic 
test method for determining the thermal performances of heat pipes,” International Journal of 
Heat and Mass Transport, Vol. 53, pp. 4567-4578, 2010 (SCI, IF=2.378; 8/115 in 
ENGINEERING, MECHANICAL) 
With a view toward shortening the necessary time to examine the thermal performances of 
heat pipes, a novel dynamic test method is originated and compared to the conventional 
steady-states test. A set of dynamic parameters of thermal performances of heat pipes is ideated 
from the observed transient phenomenon. Bending angles, fill ratios, and shapes of heat pipes are 
investigated in order to study their influences on the thermal performances of heat pipes for both 
steady-state and dynamic tests. A model based on the investigated dynamic test is established to 
explain the experimental results. Experimental results demonstrate that deformation of heat pipes 
would damage the thermal performances of heat pipes most significantly. Larger fill ratios would 
increase the operation limitations but also lead to less sensitive temperature responses of heat 
pipes. The parameters and the influences of factors between the steady-state test and the dynamic 
test are found to be remarkably analogous. As a consequence, the dynamic test can be adopted 
instead of the steady-state test to determine the thermal performance of heat pipes when high 
efficiency is of prior concern.

2011), Cancun, Mexico, Jan. 23-27, 2011 
This paper presents a bipolar electrical probe for implantable nerve stimulation treatment. 
This probe features bio-inspired microtubes to enhance the adhesion with tissues and to extrude 
out a tissue adhesive.  The probe has a hollow chamber to store the tissue adhesive, and the 
adhesive can flow outside through a seal which is dissolved when exposed to water in tissues.  
The probe is fabricated from a designed 4-layer flexible printed circuit (FPC) substrate.  The 
FPC is composed of polyimide and patterned coppers layers adhered together by a glue.  In 
addition to the electrical conduction, the copper circuit on the FPC can be used as sacrificial 
material for making the microtubes and the chamber.  Polyurethane (PU) is used to cover the 
chamber, and parylene C is deposited for biocompatibility.  Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is chosen 
to seal the microtubes due to its water solubility and biodegradability. By combining FPC 
structure design with post process, an adhesive implantable stimulating probe was fabricated.

7. International Cooperation Activities 
Since artificial muscle is the key component for driving the tunable lens in our subproject, we 
have been developing the associated technology in a separate project under the support of the 
National Science Council, Taiwan. This project is an international collaboration project for 
promoting the development of artificial muscles. This project proposed an international 
collaboration with Laboratoire d'Analyse et d'Architecture des Systèmes (LAAS), Toulous, 
France. LAAS is the largest laboratory for developing micro/nanofabrication under Centere 
National de las Recherche Scientifique (CNRS). This project developed the fabrication process of 
polymer actuators, associated mechanical model, and applications of polymer actuators in 
biomedical microfluidics and micro-optics. The research team from the Taiwan side developed 
the microfabrication and analytical modeling. A drug delivery system based on polymer actuator 
has been designed and fabricated. The research team from the France side worked on the 
characterization of the fabricated devices and the development of micro-optics based on polymer 
actuators. Electro-active polymers exhibit interesting properties for MEMS integration. Their low 
Young modulus allows high deformations at low voltages (compared to silicon electrostatic 
actuators), their low cost makes them compatible with mass production markets and their 
physicochemical properties makes them particularly well suited to bio and health applications as 
well as for optical applications. The goal of this collaborative study is to evaluate functional 
properties and potential applications of such materials in several MEMS approaches.

1 月 25 日 
    首先是由Christofer Hierold與Pasqualina M. Sarro進行歡迎致詞，報告MEMS
這幾年來的發展與 MEMS 研討會這幾年的發展狀況，並對於研討會錄取文章進
行分析報告。接著是第一天的邀請演講，邀請到的是台積電的 Dr. Lin Burn，提
到了微機電對半導體微影技術的提升。再來是大會的第一個主題—致動器，總共
有三篇論文發表，第一篇由韓國的 Hyun-Young Choi 提出的由電磁控制的相機快
門，這個快門主要的應用是在手機上的相機，它有很低的消耗功率(<80mA)，最
快的快門速度是 1/370s。第二篇是 Mahdi Sadeghi 提出的用靜電力驅動的微致動
器陣列，他利用矽油為工作溶液，最後鍍上 Parylene C 做為防水層，利用壓力差
和靜電力，因為液體的不可壓縮性，所以可以造成表面的大變形。最後一篇是日
本的 Y. Matsumoto 所提出的，基本工作原理都和上一篇類似，唯一不同的地方
就是驅動的來源，上一篇是由靜電力驅動，而此篇是由壓電材料驅動，利用壓電
材料造成形變，去擠壓薄膜接著造成表面的大變形。 
    下一個主題是藥物系統，其中有一篇由 Darrin J. Young 提出的植入式的血壓
計，利用 RF transceiver 進行體外充電，將 MEMS 壓力感測器和電路整合在軟性
電路板上。透過此技術，就可以及時的監測病患的血壓。另一篇給藥系統是利用
鉑金電極電解工作溶液然後產生氣泡，當氣泡越來越多的時候就會壓縮儲藥囊，
因此藥物就可以透過微流道釋放出去。最後一篇是在蛾的腦內植入電極，利用不
同位置的電極去刺激蛾的神經，而此神經就是控制蛾在飛行時的左旋和右旋，所
以用此方法就可以控制蛾飛行時是要左轉還是右轉。 
    下午分別有兩個演講場次同時進行，其中一個主題是製程，另一個是流體系
統，而我選擇了製程的相關演講。第一篇是由 Berkeley 的 Qin Zhou 所提出的，
他們提出一種微化學氣相層積的方式來接合 graphene(一種由碳原子所構成的二
維晶體)，由特別的 MEMS 結構和加熱端和冷卻端可以控制 graphene 的層積速
度，由理論方面推導，此方法的冷卻速率高於傳統氣相層積足足有 104。

1 月 26 日 
    早上邀請的演講者是瑞士的 Viola Vogel 教授，演講的題目是機械與生物信
4 
進入。不過在 Q&A 的時候有教授提出質疑，表示此機械結構只有表面會擋住氣
泡，底層仍然會有氣泡通過，而失去了通過指定流道的假設。另外，台灣清華大
學的 Chih-Chun Lee 使用的 NOA63 的 UV 膠做為固定結構接點的材料，實驗後
也發現高分子 UV 膠能夠有效阻擋熱以及電流，進而降低設計的微透鏡受到外界
熱源或電流的影響。參加完一整天的會議之後，發現高分子材料的應用儼然成為
一種趨勢，在未來勢必會有越來越多的高分子材料使用在微機電的領域當中，也
一定程度的提升微機電元件技術的創新以及競爭力。 
 
1 月 27 日  
首先是第三天的邀請演講--Bruce Dunn 來自 UCLA 材料科學與工程學系，
此論文開發出一種製造 3D 微結構電池的新方法，有別於傳統的 2D 結構，本論
文在製程方面應用了微切削加工方法來製造電極陣列，接著在結構上電鍍上
polypyrrole(PPy)，利用這層高分子的氧化還原態做為離子交換膜儲存能量，並且
宣稱此方法做出來的 3D 結構電池只需要極小的面積就可以達到很高的能量密
度。 
    接著是 power MEMS 的論文發表，第一位是由 UCLA Janet I. Hur 等人提出
的文章，他們提出了用於燃料電池上的自主幫浦，主要是利用兩平行電板給予電
位差產生二氧化碳氣泡，接著在流道出口的前面放上一片多孔隙的薄膜。如此一
來，當氣泡聚集過多時，就會藉由這片薄膜將氣體釋放出去，此時流道入口的工
作溶液就會因為壓力差而向前移動，這一來一往的循環就成了自主性的幫浦，並
且可以提供最大的能量密度為 8mW/cm2。 
    第二篇由來自英國倫敦帝國大學的 Cairan He 所研究的無線傳輸系統。此系
統主要是用於無線生醫感測上，透過一個無電池的發射器，感測器所輸出的訊號
就可以順利的傳遞出去。而靜電接受器可以將感測器訊號轉為電壓訊號。 
    最後一篇是由東京大學的 Daigo Miki 所提出的非線性彈簧微駐極電介體產
生器，這類的研究多應用於能量採集方面。與其它人不同的，在於此篇利用了混
合的高深寬比聚對二甲苯(parylene)的彈簧結構，在 46-73Hz 的振動頻率下，可以
產生將近1mm的高振幅。當靜電力維持主結構與機板之間的空隙時，頻率在63Hz
處可以達到 1μW 的能量輸出。 
    經過了中午的休息時間，接著是筆者所發表的論文”An electro-active 
nano-valve array for reusable drug delivery system”，安排於本日下午 14:00 到 15:50
的時段以海報形式發表，如下圖一所示。本篇論文提出在氧化鋁薄膜（AAO，
上面有 100nm~200nm 的均勻奈米孔洞）上利用多孔性電致動高分子 PPy 的膨脹

Abstract:  
This paper presents the modeling, fabrication, and 
characterization of a miniature joint made of carbon 
nanotube (CNTs) bundles. Dielectrophoresis force was 
employed to assemble CNTs across two metal components. 
The CNTs were uniformly dispersed in ethanol using 
ultrasonic shaking in prior to the dielectrophoresis assembly. 
The CNT solution was then dispensed and regarded as the 
gap between the metal components across which an AC 
electric field is applied. The CNTs align to the electric field 
and formed several bundles as the ethanol dried out. These 
CNT bundles were then reinforced by a parylene coating 
through physical vapor deposition. A small deformation 
model was carried out to analyze the stiffness of the CNT 
bundles. The fabricated miniature joint was characterized on 
a precision motorized stage. One side of the joint was fixed 
on the stage; the other side was connected to a load cell. The 
tensile loading exerting on the joint was obtained by 
measuring the variations of the electrical resistance of the 
CNTs. The measured tensile stiffness of the joint was 25.08 
mN/µm. The force sensitivity of the joint was 7.7 %/µN. 
The proposed joint is capable of connecting two miniature 
metal components and monitoring real-time loading 
conditions. 
Keywords: MEMS, Force monitoring, Carbon nanotube 
1.  INTRODUTION 
Recently, carbon nanotube (CNT) has attracted much 
attention in research due to its advantages of high strength 
and piezoresistive characteristics [1-5]. It has been applied 
in developing actuators [6-8] and strain sensors [9-11]. 
Composite joints reinforced by CNTs have also been 
investigated [12-14]. Due to its versatile characteristics, 
CNT is anticipated to enhance the functionality and 
complexity of the emerging micro-robots [15-18] 
For the development of complex micro-machines, a 
miniature joint made of CNT bundles is investigated in this 
work. The piezoresistive characteristics of the CNTs are 
utilized so that the joint is able to detect the force exerting 
on itself. The proposed miniature joint is depicted in Fig. 1. 
It consists of several CNT bundles and connects two 
mechanical components which could be fabricated through 
micromachining techniques. The CNT bundles are in 
contact with two metal electrodes which are deposited and 
patterned, respectively on the mechanical components. 
These two electrodes are used to fabricate the miniature 
joint across the mechanical components. When a relative 
motion occurs between the mechanical components, the 
joint is stressed, causing the change of the electrical 
resistance of the CNT bundles. The resistance variation can 
then be measured through the metal electrodes. In this paper, 
the stiffness ratio of the proposed joint will be analyzed. A 
dielectrophoresis method will be used to assemble CNT 
bundles across the mechanical components. Finally, an 
experiment to extract the gauge factor of the joint will be 
carried out.

carbon nanotube bundles 
Fig. 2: Deformed configuration of the proposed joint 
subjected to two external forces and one moment. The 
dashed lines indicate the original shape of the joint before 
deformation. 
 
2.  ANALYSIS OF JOINT 
The in-plane stiffness of the proposed joint was analyzed 
by considering each CNT bundle as a thin circular rod [20-
21]. The structure of the joint and the deformed 
configuration due to two orthogonal forces (Fx and Fy) and 
one moment (M) are illustrated in Fig. 2. It is assumed that 
the CNT bundles are uniformly distributed in the joint. 
Figure 2 shows only one representative CNT bundle. The 
dashed lines indicate the original shape of the joint before 
deformation. With respect to its counterpart on the left hand 
side, the component on the right hand side undergoes a 
horizontal displacement (Δx), a vertical displacement (Δy) 
and a rotation (θ), respectively.

along the axial direction under uni-axial loading test 
 
 
Fig. 7: Measured resistance change as a function of the 
axial force exerting on the joint. ΔR is the increase of the 
resistance, and Ro is the resistance at zero force. 
 
5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The force-displacement characteristic measured in the 
uni-axial loading test is shown in Fig. 6. The fact that the 
axial force increases linearly with the displacement confirms 
the linear elasticity assumption for modeling the joint. The 
result in Fig. 6 indicates that the axial stiffness of the joint is 
kx=25.08 mN/µm. According to Eq. (1) and Eq. (2), the 
stiffness ratio of the axial to the transverse direction is

x , (5) 
where t is the thickness of the CNT bundle. Hence the 
stiffness in the transverse direction should be ky=3.9 µN/µm 
for the CNT bundles of 200 µm in length and 5 µm in 
thickness. 
The measured resistance increases slightly with the axial 
force exerting on the joint, as shown in Fig. 7. For zero force, 
the measured resistance is 197 MΩ. Hence the electrical 
sensitivity for detecting the axial force is 7.7 %/µN. It 
should also be noted that the gauge factor for the results in 
Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 can be extracted as GF=0.39 for the CNT 
bundles of 200 µm in length. The extracted gauge factor is 
smaller than one because the parylene coating significantly 
increased the contact resistance between the measurement 
apparatus and the electrodes on the joint. To reduce the 
contact resistance and to increase the force sensitivity, the 
parylene coating on the electrodes should be removed in the 
future. 
5. CONCLUSION 
A miniature joint which made of CNT bundles for the 
development of microrobots has been proposed. The 
piezoresistive CNT bundles also serve as an embedded 
force-sensing unit. The CNT bundles have been assembled 
using a dielectrophoresis process and then reinforced by a 
parylene coating. The preliminary result indicated that the 
axial stiffness of the fabricated joint was 25.08 mN/µm and 
the force sensitivity was 7.7 %/µN. The transverse stiffness 
was estimated to be 3.9 µN/µm. To increase the force 
sensitivity and gauge factor of the joint, the contact 
resistance should be reduced. The stiffness ratio of the 
proposed joint will be investigated thoroughly in the future.
