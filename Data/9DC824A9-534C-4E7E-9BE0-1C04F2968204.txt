Abstract 
Novel amphipathic derivative of chitosan 
(carboxymethyl-hexanoyl chitosan, CHC) was made 
into mats of nanofibers (~100 nm) via electrospinning.  
The resulting mats were further cross-linked with 
genipin.  The morphology of CHC nanofibers was 
examined using a field emission scanning electron 
microscope (FESEM).  The optimum parameters of 
CHC nanofiber was achieved when the CHC 
concentration was 4 wt% and electrospinning was 
conducted with a voltage of 20 kV over a distance of 10 
cm.  The characterizations of biocompatibility, 
hemocompatibility, and anti-bacterial activity of the 
nanofibers were also investigated.  The results show 
that CHC nanofibers still preserved anti-bacterial 
activity and thrombogeneicity owing to those residual 
amino groups of chitosan and exhibit high 
biocompatibility for L929 fibroblast test.  Thus CHC 
exhibited the potential to serve as a novel wound 
dressing and surgical implants application by these 
advanced features.

Introduction 
Electrospinning technology has attracted a great deal 
of attention with many researchers to conduct this 
specific research, including filter, protective cloth, ion 
polymer battery, drug release substrate, tissue scaffolds, 
medical implants and wound dressing1-3.  By 
electrospinning process, it can produce nanoscale fibers 
and the structure with nanoscale diameter can be 
precisely controlled by the viscosity of the solution, the 
electrical field, and the distance between the tip and the 
collector4.  Furthermore, electrospun nanofibrous mats 
exhibit useful characteristics, such as high-specific 
surface area and high porosity with very small pore size, 
are very suitable for advanced wound dressing 
applications. 
Natural biopolymers have better biocompatibility 
and biodegradability than synthetic polymers, but they 
are difficult to be spun into nanofibers due to their  
molecular structure5.  In the literature, a number of 
natural polymers have been successfully electrospun, 
including silk fibroin6, collagen7, and gelatin5, 8-11, 
chitin and chiston12-14, and hyaluronic acid (HA)1.  In 
addition, gelatin/PCL15, HA/gelatin1, and 
PLGA/chitin16 have been co-electrospun for the 
purpose of improving electrospinning processability for 
nanofibrous nanocomposites. 
A new type of amphiphilic chitosan (CS), 
carboxymethyl-hexanoyl chitosan (CHC)17-19 (Fig. 1a), 
was synthesized through the use of both hydrophilic 
carboxymethyl and hydrophobic hexanoyl substitutions 
from the chitosan (Fig. 1b).  CHC exhibits the 
following features: (1) high water absorption (>800%) 
and retention capacity [even superior to hyaluronic acid 
(Fig.1c)], (2) ability of encapsulating drugs via 
self-assembling nano-capsules that serving as 
controlled release vehicle, (3) controllable properties 
such as water absorbability, water retention capacity by 
adjusting the chemical structure in CHC.  These 
advantages of CHC are very suitable to develop a 
biomedical application such as wound dressing. 
This paper focuses its attention to discuss the 
morphology on electrospinning of nanofibers from 
CHC and the biocompatibility, anti-bacterial activity 
and thrombogeneicity also would be further 
investigated. 
Experimental 
Materials 
Carboxymethyl-hexanoyl chitosan was purchased 
from Advanced Delivery Technology Co., Ltd ).  
Genipin as the cross-linking agent was purchased from 
Challenge Bioproducts Co., Ltd., Taiwan.  The CHC 
solution was prepared by dissolving CHC powders (4 
wt%) in the 4 wt% poly(ethyleneoxide) (PEO, as 
thickener, Mw: 300,000, Aldrich, USA) aqueous 
solution (DI-water) at 35°C under stirring for 24 h. 
Electrospinning 
Figure 2 shows the electrospinning apparatus 
consisting of a power supply, a syringe pump, a rotating 
cylinder, and a driving holder, which could move the 
needle transversely.  The rotating cylinder (with a 
radius of 15 cm and a width of 45 cm, rotating at 120 
rpm) was connected to the negative ground of the 
power supply.  The rotation of the cylinder stretches 
the mat longitudinally. The thickness of the mat was 
controlled by the electrospinning time.  The needle 
branch formation with the higher CHC concentration 
(5%, Fig. 3c).Using the optimum parameter, the 
diameter of CHC nanofibers were thinner than those 
reported in the literature: PLGA (780±200 nm), gelatin 
(447±123 nm), and elastin (1060±170 nm)25. 
Furthermore, SEM image (Fig. 3d) shows that 
nanofibers after cross-linking to fabricate to mats, 
which would be applied in the wound dressing. 
Antibacterial activity 
To study the antibacterial activity, Staphylococcus 
aureus was employed.  A wound dressing should be 
able to prevent infection from bacteria.  Because CHC 
was derived from chitosan, the residual cationic amino 
groups (NH3+) of chitosan can associate with anions on 
the bacteria wall, bind to the cytoplasmic membrane to 
suppress its biosynthesis, thereby disrupting the mass 
transport across the wall, and accelerating the death of 
the bacteria23, 26. 
Figure 4 shows the effect of grafting on the growth 
curves of S. aureus.  The bacteria (negative control) 
grew from 2×105 to 5×107 CFU/mL after incubating for 
24 hr at 37°C.  However when the bacteria contacted 
with the CS and CHC mats, the concentration of 
bacteria reduced rapidly and died out after incubating at 
37°C for 10.5 hr and 21 hr.  The rate of the bacteria 
reduction in the CS mats is faster than that of CHC 
mats.  The reason is that some parts of amino groups 
in the CHC was modified to carboxymethyl and 
hexanoyl substitutions, thus decreasing the antibacterial 
capability. 
Hemocompatibility 
The hemocompatibility of CHC mats was evaluated 
by blood clotting times (i.e. activated partial thrombin 
time, APTT) and platelet adhesion.  The blood 
coagulation cascade included intrinsic pathway, 
extrinsic pathway, and common pathway.  APTT was 
used to examine mainly the intrinsic pathway27.  
Figure 5a shows that the clotting times (37.5±2 s) of the 
commercial swabs were close to the human plasma (the 
negative control, 39±1.5 s), whereas those of CHC 
(33±1.8 s) and CS (32±2.2 s) mats were shorter.  The 
difference between the APTT of CS and CHC mats was 
insignificant, indicating that CHC mats still preserve 
enough amino groups to promote blood coagulation.  
This would be favorable to enhance wound healing. 
Figure 5b shows the number of platelets adhesion on 
the swabs, CHC and CS mats.  The order of the 
platelets adhesion was CS (6200± 500 cells/mm2) > 
CHC (3500± 470 cells/mm2) > swabs (1300± 300 
cells/mm2).  The results indicated that the capability of 
platelet adhesion to CHC mats was superior to that of 
swabs.  Because commercial swabs were made of 
cottons, which did not provide any amino groups to 
enhance the platelet adhesion, whereas the CHC mats 
possessed some amino groups.  This suggests that the 
platelet adhesion can be increased by electrostatic 
attraction between platelets and positively charged 
CHC.  Therefore, CHC exhibits a potential to be a 
wound dressing via its shorter blood coagulation time 
and higher capability of platelets adhesion than 
commercial swabs. 
Cell proliferation 
Comparing with the negative control, L929 
fibroblasts grew well on the CHC mats after incubation 
for 24 h (2200±500 cells/cm2) and 48 hr (3900±400 
cells/cm2), as shown in Fig 6a. Furthermore, the optical 
microscope image indeed show that the cells grow well 
in the CHC nanofiber mats (Fig. 6b). These results 
demonstrated that CHC mats exhibited non-cytotoxicity 
and was able to promote cell proliferation. This result is 
similar to the work in the literature. Li et al.28 
mentioned that the higher surface to volume ratio of 
PLGA nanofibers provided more room for the cell 
attachment than regular extracellular matrix (ECM) 
fibers, implying that our CHC electrospun nanofiber 
mats provide large surface area with a 
three-dimensional structure of high porosity which can 
play a key role in the tissue engineering as scaffolds for 
cells29. 
Conclusion 
Electrospun CHC nanofiber mats display not only high 
water absorption and retention capacity to avoid the 
tissue fluid leakage in the wound, but also great 
antibacterial activity, blood coagulation capability, and 
biocompatibility.  With these advanced features, these 
novel nanofibers would be very competitive in the field 
of advanced wound dressing.  It was anticipated that 
CHC can be employed as a new biomedical material in 
the future.
