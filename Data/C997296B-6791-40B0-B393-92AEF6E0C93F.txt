Introduction 
Timber connections play a crucial role on structural behavior of timber 
constructions, as they usually affect the internal force distribution in the whole 
structure. The Nuki joint is one of the simplest methods connecting the structural 
components to create a shelter, which means penetrating an element through 
another. However, the simplicity is not the only advantage of Nuki joints, they 
have good ductility as they use both embedment and friction to resist the moment 
force. Hence the oriental carpentries, such as Taiwan, Japan, and China, very 
often use Nuki joints to connect the posts and beams in timber structures. The 
Japanese Nuki joints are usually wedged to prevent from the initial rotation, while 
the gap is usually acceptable in Taiwanese carpentry. This wedge-stabilization 
results in different structural behaviors of Nuki joints in Japan and Taiwan.  
Recent years have seen increased attention being given to structural behavior of 
Japanese Nuki joints in literatures1-4. Contrarily, little literature has been 
published on the behavior of Taiwanese Nuki joints. The results of field survey 
show that Nuki joints in Taiwan comprise three various types, which are the 
continuous, butted and dovetail types, as shown in Fig. 1. These Nuki joints have 
different mechanisms in connecting the beams inside the columns, but the 
appearances are identical. One of the primary research questions to be addressed 
is the difference of these Nuki joints in mechanical performance.  
Our previous report5 has investigated the rotational behavior of continuous type of 
Nuki joints subjected to moment action. However, the mechanical behavior of 
butted and dovetail Nuki joints are still in question. This study attempts to explore 
the rotational performance of butted Nuki joints by comparing the theoretical 
model established in this study with the experimental results and discuss the 
differences of these two various types Taiwanese Nuki joints in behavior when 
subjected to moment action. 
 
The rotational behavior 
The previous report6 pointed out that the beams of butted Nuki joints do not rotate 
synchronically, i.e. the separated beam will not affect another. Thus we only 
relative velocity of friction, the friction coefficient is assumed as a constant in 
this study to simplify the calculation and keep it simple. 
 
Assuming the moment resistance of the butted Nuki joint is provided by the 
embedment and friction between beam and column. The following relationship 
can be expressed 
fricemtotal MMM +=                                                  (1) 
in which the Mem and Mfric respectively represents the moment resistance provided 
by embedment and friction. 
 
The geometry of half butted Nuki joint with a rotation θ  is demonstrated in Fig. 
3. To simplify the calculation concerning the geometries, we let

where μ stands for the friction coefficient for wood-wood surfaces.  
Only limited literatures report the value of friction coefficient on wood-wood 
surface. McKenzte and Karpovich8 pointed out that the sliding friction coefficient 
for wood-wood surface ranges from 0.1-0.65. Murase9 indicated the value of 0.58 
for species of western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla). The value of 0.6 was used 
in this study as it is reasonable and corresponds to the experimental results. 
 
The lever arm for friction effect, Lfric, is equivalent to the overall height of slot: 
6 
column. As shown in Fig. 6, the end of the beam positioned inside the column was 
polished due to the friction. This might result in changing of the friction 
coefficient at the contact surfaces. In the other words, the friction coefficient 
might change with rotation. Tiny compression failure takes place on beam 
element at location where the beam contacts the edge of slot on column, as shown 
in Fig. 7. Comparing the observed failures with those found in continuous Nuki 
joint, the damage of butted joint is much slighter and no shear failure 
perpendicular to grain occurs. 
 
Verification 
Fig. 8 compares the θ−M  relationships obtained from experimental results with 
those from theoretical models proposed in this study. Notice that the model 
considers the gap, the initial slip of joint can be observed not only in experimental 
data but also in the theoretical model. Satisfactory agreement can be found 
between the analytical and experimental results especially in the elastic stage. The 
error at larger rotation might because of the assumption that the friction 
coefficient is constant, as the friction coefficient might be affected by the inclined 
contact surfaces as pointed out in the literature8 and polishment of contact 
surfaces on beam aforementioned. For more accurate prediction especially in the 
inelastic stage, the friction coefficient between wood-wood surfaces considering 
the inclined contact surface is required in the future.  
The initial stiffness, Ki, of the Nuki joint is defined in Fig. 9, which represents the 
slope of the θ−M  curve after the initial slip stage. Fig. 10 demonstrates the 
comparison of initial stiffness obtained from experiments and analytical models. 
Good agreement can be found, as the average error is 2.36%. The comparison can 
manifest the assumptions made previously in the elastic stage.  
 
Feasibility of Hooke’s law 
From Fig. 4 we can learn that partial compression will occur at the area that beam 
contacts column, which might lead to significant error if this effect was ignored. 
Previous section shows acceptable agreement between results obtained from

δθ 1, tan−=                                                 (18) 
Thus it is reasonable for butted Nuki joints to have larger rotation without any 
moment resistance, and these connections are more sensitive to the gaps between 
beams and slots on columns. 
 
 
Conclusion 
This study proposed a theoretical model to explore the mechanical behavior of 
butted Nuki joints and verified by a total of 21 full-scale tests. Observation from 
the experiments shows that the butted Nuki joints only subjected to slight damage 
compared with those observed in the continuous Nuki connections. The butted 
Nuki connections show considerable lower initial stiffness and moment resistance 
than the continuous Nuki joints. Also we found the butted Nuki connections are 
more sensitive to the gaps, which means larger initial rotation. This paper not only 
appears to support the superiority of mechanical performance of continuous Nuki 
joints, but also reveals the necessity of research effort to be devoted to the 
reinforcement of butted Nuki joints in the future.
