Experimental Section 
 
Materials 
 
I was prepared by the reaction of cis-1,2-cyclohexene oxide with γ-butyrolactone (γ-BL) in the presence 
of BF3·OEt2 in dichloromethane using a previously reported method24 (bp: 88–89 °C, 2.2 mm Hg), and was 
stored at room temperature under nitrogen. OPIA was used as the photoinitiator. ITX and DMPA were used as 
non-aromatic photosensitizers, A was used as an aromatic photosensitizer, and SnCl4, CH3SO2OCF3, and 
BF3·OEt2 were used as conventional cationic initiators. All compounds, except OPIA (Nissho Sangyo) and A 
(Acros), were purchased from Aldrich Co. and used as received without further treatment. Dry 
dichloromethane was obtained by refluxing over calcium hydride and distillation. 
 
Cationic photopolymerization with an OPIA/A initiating system  
 
In a dry box, 3.89 ×  10-2 g (0.062 mmol) of OPIA and 9.76 ×  10-3 g (0.065 mmol) of A were 
dissolved in 1.0 ml of dichloromethane and added to a round Teflon fillister (diameter ×  depth = 16.5 ×  5 
mm). A 30-μm-thick transparent polypropylene film was laminated on the top of the fillister to prevent 
moisture diffusion. The solution was exposed to UV light (λmax: 254 nm) at 25 °C in a BLX-E254 crosslinker 
box (Vilber Lourmat, Marne-la-Vallée, France) for 5 min with a light intensity of 6.0 mW/cm2 (measured 
using a UVX-25 radiometer, European Union). Then, 1.00 g (5.44 mmol) of liquid I was immediately added 
to the fillister and mixed thoroughly with the photoreacted OPIA/A solution with a dry glass rod. After 
standing for 5 min, 10 μL of trimethylamine were added to the mixture to quench the reaction. After 
qualitative analysis of the γ-BL by gas–liquid chromatography (GLC), the solution was washed with water 
and dried with anhydrous MgSO4. The procedure for separating and purifying the product was performed as 
described in the literature.17 Other experimental procedures, such as the cationic polymerization of I initiated 
by a Lewis acid and photoinitiator were performed as described in the literature.17 
 
Degree of monomeric conversion17 
 
Homogeneous mixtures of I, initiators, and other additives before and after irradiation were coated on 
the KBr disks. After the solvent was removed under reduced pressure, the samples were recorded on a 
Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR). The total area of the νas,C-H and νs,C-H absorptions at 2950 and 2850 cm-1 was 
considered the internal standard (IS). The change in the peak area due to the spiroester group at 1323 cm-1 
before and after the reaction was monitored, and the degree of conversion (DC) was determined using the 
following equation: 
 
DC (%) = [1-(A1323 /AIS)a /(A1323 /AIS)b] x 100 
 
Where (A1323/AIS)a is the ratio between the area of spiro absorption at 1323 cm-1 and the area of IS absorption 
after irradiation; (A1323/AIS)b is the ratio between the area of spiro absorption and the area of IS absorption 
before irradiation.

Results and Discussion 
 
Cationic photopolymerization of I with an OPIA/A initiating system  
 
When I was mixed thoroughly with OPIA/A (molar ratio: 1.0/1.05) and the mixture was exposed to UV 
radiation at 254 nm (λmax), cationic photopolymerization occurred instantly to afford a polymer with an NMR 
spectrum (Figure 1a) similar to that of the polymer obtained by direct irradiation of I with OPIA.17 
By-products such as γ-BL and -[CHO]n- oligomers produced by single ring-opening side reactions were 
examined. The structure of the polymer was identified as [(trans-OCB)p-(cis-OCB)q-(CHO)s]. An OPIA/A 
mixture was irradiated with UV of the same wavelength; I was then added immediately, and reaction took 
place within 3–5 min. The polymer thus formed has a simple 1H NMR spectrum (Figure 1b), quite different 
from that in Figure 1a. The by-product mentioned above was not detected by GLC or FTIR spectroscopy. This 
proved that I had undergone a full double ring-opening cationic polymerization without any single 
ring-opening side reactions.  
 
 
Figure 1. 1H NMR spectra of polymers obtained by (a) UV exposure of mixture of I and OPIA/A at 
wavelength of 254 nm; and (b) UV exposure of OPIA/A at 254 nm followed by addition of I. 
 
Polymer structure 
 
The correlation of the protons of the polymer with the simple 1H NMR spectrum (Figure 1b) was 
achieved using DQF-COSY NMR spectroscopy (Figure 2). The absorption of the -CH2CO2- at 2.42 ppm was 
not disturbed by any other absorption of the polymer and its proton area is almost one-eighth of the total 
protons area.12 This indicates that the repeating unit in the polymer contains 16 protons and has the same 
hydrogen numbers as I. It is therefore reasonable to deduce that the structure of the repeating unit is 
2-oxycyclohexyl butanoate. It must be emphasized that the chemical shift at 4.60 ppm is the methine 
hydrogen Ha of the 2-oxycyclohexyl butanoate unit due to deshielding of the ester group26 at the trans 
position. The structure of the polymer is thus identified as a stereoregular poly(ether ester), (-[trans-2-OCB]n-) 
(II). The stereochemistry of the repeating unit was proved by the 1H NMR spectrum of the pure model isomer 
trans-2-hydroxycyclohexyl butanoate.17

UV irradiation of OPIA 
 
The exposure of OPIA to UV light at different wavelengths, in the presence or absence of A, was 
studied. 2-Phenylquinoline was used to examine whether or not the photoacid (i.e., H+SbF6-), which initiates 
the cationic polymerization of I, was produced during irradiation. Once the 2-phenylquinoline has been 
protonated by the photoacid (or proton), the 2-phenylquinolinium ion formed shows a significant 
bathochromic shift in its UV absorption spectrum.30 Figure 3 shows the UV absorption of 2-phenylquinoline 
after addition to the OPIA being exposed to UV light under various conditions. It was found that, in contrast 
to direct irradiation of OPIA on its own at a wavelength of 254 nm, which causes the UV absorption of the 
2-phenylquinolinium ion to undergo a significant bathochromic shift (curves a-c), the UV irradiated OPIA/A 
mixture shows no bathochromic shift after the addition of 2-phenylquinoline (curve d). When an OPIA/A 
mixture was UV irradiated at 365 nm, the added 2-phenylquinoline was converted to the 2-phenylquinolinium 
ion and thus showed a significant bathochromic shift in its UV absorption (curve e). These experimental 
results reveal that when OPIA/A is irradiated at 365 nm, electron transfer from the excited A to the OPIA in 
the singlet A/OPIA exciplex yielding a photoacid occurs.31 In contrast, when an OPIA/A mixture is exposed 
to UV at 254 nm, no photoacid is produced; the abovementioned reaction does not occur. The only reaction 
may be transfer of an electron from the excited A to the OPIA in the triplet A/OPIA exciplex to yield a 
PDAC,21,23 which can initiate the cationic polymerization of I.

of the 2-oxytetrahydrofuran-2-ylium cation (OTFC)32 (obtained by attack of the PDAC on the acetal 
oxygen of I) at ca. 180 ppm are both found. Figure 4b shows the spectrum of 
2-methyl-1,4,6-trioxaspiro[4,4]nonane (MTN) after reaction with PDAC. The DOLC absorption at ca. 
178 ppm is much higher than that of the OTFC, which is only a trace absorption at 180 ppm. Figures 4c 
and 4d show the spectra of cis- and trans-2,3-dimethyl-1,4,6-trioxaspiro[4,4]nonanes (cis- and 
trans-DMTNs), respectively, after reaction with PDAC. Only the peaks at ca. 178 ppm, corresponding to 
DOLC are found, and no OTFC absorption at 180 ppm occurs. The substituted methyl groups at C-2 and 
C-3 of the DMTNs may prevent the PDAC from attacking the adjacent acetal oxygen because of steric 
hindrance. It is therefore reasonable to infer that the attack on PDAC by the cyclic ether oxygen of I (a 
more complicated structure) is a steric-directing reaction. In addition to the effect of its bulky volume, 
the resonance stabilization effect of PDAC may play an important role in the regiospecific 
polymerization of I. The Mulliken net atomic charges on the oxygen atoms in I were calculated by 
computer simulation (Table 1).33 The charges on the oxygen atoms in the cyclic acetal ring (O-1 and O-4) 
are higher than that on the cyclic ether ring oxygen (O-6). Theoretically, the cation (or Lewis acid) 
should predominantly attack the cyclic acetal oxygen to afford the OTFC. For example, SnCl4 is a 
weaker Lewis acid34 and only attacks the cyclic acetal oxygen to afford the OTFC (Figure 4f); the OTFC 
then propagates the reaction (Eq. 2 of Scheme 1) of I to yield III, a stereoregular poly(ether ester), the 
structure of which was identified by its DQF-COSY NMR spectrum (Figure 5). However, when I 
undergoes conventional cationic polymerization initiated by BF3·OEt2 or CH3SO2OCF3 (both are stronger 
Lewis acids than SnCl4),35,36 or cationic photopolymerization in OPIA/ITX or an OPIA/DMPA initiating 
system, both DOLC and OTFC cations are produced (Figures 4g and 4h). No regiospecific reaction 
producing the stereoregular poly(ether ester) occurs. The reason is perhaps that the corresponding 
initiating species such as BF3, CH3+, H+, and C6H5C(OCH3)2+17,37 thus formed are so energetic that they 
can attack the oxygen atoms in both the cyclic ether and the acetal without any selectivity with regard to 
the polymerization route (Eq. 1 or 2 in Scheme 1)17. Although C6H5C(OCH3)2+ cation might be greatly 
stabilized by two methoxy and a phenyl groups and bulky enough to increase its selectivity in the 
reaction , but the free energy of the transition state of [C6H5C(OCH3)2+..O-6-I] (O-6-I: cyclic ether 
oxygen of I) (141.08 kJ/mol) is ca. 16.16 kJ/mol (thermodynamic calculation using PM3 method)16,38 
lower than that of [C6H5C(OCH3)2+..O-1-I (or O-4-I)] (O-1-I: cyclic acetal oxygen of I) (157.69 kJ/mol). 
It seems that the difference of free energy is not large enough to prevent the ring-opening reaction of 
[C6H5C(OCH3)2+..O-1-I (or O-4-I)] (Figure 4g). For the PDAC, the energy could be also greatly 
stabilized by its resonance behavior, and might be lowered enough to enable selection of the reaction 
route and exclude side reactions. Theoretically, PDAC should select the cyclic acetal oxygen of I to 
attack because of the higher Mulliken atomic charge on that oxygen (Table 1), but it only attacks the 
cyclic ether oxygen (Eq. 1 in Scheme 1) to afford II. The result of thermodynamic calculation shows that 
the free energy of the transition state of [PDAC..O-6-I] (11.38 kJ/mol) is ca. 144.15 kJ/mol lower than 
that of [PDAC..O-1-I (or O-4-I)] (155.53 kJ/mol). The difference is large enough to let PDAC attack the 
cyclic ether oxygen of I (Figure 4e) in regiospecific manner to afford II. It is therefore reasonable to 
conclude that the polymerization of I initiated by PDAC is controlled by steric factors rather than by 
electronic factors.

Conclusions 
 
I underwent cationic polymerization initiated by the PDAC, which was obtained by exposing an 
OPIA/A mixture to UV light at 254 nm. The PDAC was shown to attack the cyclic ether oxygen of I to 
yield the only intermediate, DOLC, which propagates the reaction regiospecifically to afford II. The 
stereoregular structure of II was identified by its DQF-COSY NMR spectrum. II exhibited high volume 
expansion (2.09%) during polymerization; in contrast, III, obtained using SnCl4 as an initiator, 
demonstrated high volume shrinkage (-2.49%) during polymerization. The volume expansion of II is 
caused by the conversion of the cis substitution at C-2 and C-3 of I to trans substitution during 
polymerization. PM3 and B3LYP/6-31G(d) computationally geometry-optimized oligomer models of II 
and III were designed to explain the experimental result.
