INTRODUCTION 
     Poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) is a semicrystalline high-performance 
thermoplastic polymer with a glass transition temperature (Tg) (143℃) and a melting 
point (Tm) of the main crystallites (334℃) and is well known for its high chemical 
resistance, excellent heat resistance and good mechanical properties .  These 
excellent properties make PEEK an attractive high- performance polymer potentially 
used as a structural adhesive and as a composite matrix.  Due to its high melting 
point and high glass transition temperature , a number of modifications were adopted 
to reduce the processing temperature, such as softening the backbone and lowering 
the Tm of the PEEK .  As the carbonyl groups were replaced by sulfoxide groups in 
the PEEK backbone it subsequently resulted in a total loss of the crystalline structure ].  
However, the Tg of the modified PEEK is very high (178℃) and is still difficult to 
process.  A further modification was made by replacing the sulfoxide groups with 
sulfide groups.  The modified PEEK regained a crystalline structure at Tm of 251℃ 
and Tg of 102℃.  Wang synthesized a modified PEEK by introducting aldehyde and 
carboxylic acid groups into the backbone of PEEK to improve the processability for 
membrane applications .  Brink prepared poly(pyridine ether-co-ether ether ketone) 
to form a complex with hydrochloric acid in order to suspend the modified PEEK in 
the water .  However, the synthesis process is fairly tedious.  The effect of the 
carbonyl and ether groups on the shifts of the Tg of PEEK has been studied.  The 
ether-linked aromatic polymer, poly(phenylene oxide) (PPO) has a Tg at 85℃, while 
the Tg increased to 154℃ as carbonyl groups were inserted into the ether-linked 
backbone to form poly(ether-ketone) (PEK) polymer.  As more ether groups were 
introduced to form the PEEK backbone, the Tg shifted to a low temperature of 144℃.  
In the present paper, the modified PEEK based on the introduction of thio groups into 
the backbone in order to reduce the Tg and crystallinity of the PEEK is prepared.  
The effect of the introduced thio groups on the crystalline characteristics, degradation 
temperature, thermomechanical and processing temperature of the resultant PEEK 
will be investigated.

5. Characterization  
     The Fourier-transform infrared spectra (FTIR) of the samples were obtained 
from a Bi-Rad FT-40 spectrophotometer.  Sixty-four scans were signal-averaged at a 
resolution of 2 cm-1 from 400 cm-1 to 4000 cm-1.  The testing sample was prepared 
by cryogenically grinding the synthesized polymer with KBr and compressing the 
mixture to form a disk. 
     Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was carried out using a DuPont 2000 
DSC, measuring from room temperature to 300℃ with a scanning rate of 10℃/min.  
     Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the samples was carried out using a 
DuPont 951 TGA instrument.  The analysis was performed at a heating rate of 10℃
/min, under a nitrogen atmosphere. 
     Dynamical mechanical analysis (DMA) was performed on a DuPont 983 DMA 
unit with an operating temperature ranging from room temperature to 275℃.  The 
frequency was fixed at 1Hz and the heating rate was set at 5℃/min.  A sample size 
of approximately 50×10×2 mm was used. 
     The wide angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed at 
room temperature with powder specimens on a Philips PW1840 wide angle X-ray 
diffractometer, using Ni-filtered Cu-Kα radiation.  The diffraction angle was varied 
from 5 to 70°. 
The sample was placed on a KBr pellet and the FT-IR spectrum were obtained 
using a Perkin Elmer Spectrum one FT-IR spectrometer. The IEC was measured by 
classical titration. A membrane sample of about 0.500 g was soaked in 100 ml of 1.0 
N NaCl solution for two days. The released proton concentration was titrated using a 
0.01N NaOH solution. The water sorption values of the sulfonated polyimide 
members were determined at 30 ℃. The membranes were vacuum-dried at 100 ℃ 
for 24 h, weighed and immersed in deionized water at room temperature for 24 h. The 
wet membranes were wiped dry and quickly weighed again. The water uptake of the 
membranes was calculated as a weight percentage as follows: 
 Results and Discussion 
 
Characterization of thio-containing poly(ether ether ketone) 
 
     The synthesis of poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) and thio-containing PEEK 
polymers were characterized by FTIR analysis.  The FTIR spectra of PEEK and 
thio-conatining PEEK polymers with various percentages of TDP incorporated in the 
main chains are shown in Figure 1.  FTIR spectra of the PEEK were consistent with 
the expected structure.  Spectra comparison of the PEEK and PEESK is shown in 
Figure 1, a significant change was observed at peaks 530cm-1 and 510cm-1.  It is 
noticed that the apparent difference in chemical structure between PEEK and PEESK 
is the C-O-C and C-S-C groups.  To charactericize the PEESK structure, FTIR 
spectra of the neat poly(phenylene sulfide) (PPS) and poly(phenylene oxide) (PPO) 
are used as modeling compounds to distinguish absorption modes of PEEK and 
thio-contianing PEEK polymers.  The FTIR spectra of PPS and PPO demonstrate 
different absorption positions of the rocking of ether and sulfide groups from 400cm-1 
to 590cm-1.  It was found that the peaks at 510cm-1 and 480cm-1 are corresponding to 
the rocking abosorption peaks of C-O-C and C-S-C groups, respectively.  Based on 
FTIR spectra of modeling compoundings, the C-S-C intensity of thio-containing 
PEEK polymers will be increased with the introduction of thio-groups in the 
backbones.  As shown in Figure 1, the sulfur group peak at 510cm-1 increases 
significantly with the increase of the TDP introduced.  They give a rise with the 
increase of thio-group content in the resultant copolymers.  
X-ray diffraction analysis 
     Wide Angle X-ray Diffraction (XRD) was used to analyze the crystal structure 
and calculate the crystallinity of the thio-containing PEEK polymers. The crystallinity 
was estimated by integrating the area of diffraction peaks divided by the summation 
area under the crystallized peak and the amorphous area.  Amorphous PEEK can be 
obtained by quenching the molten PEEK into liquid nitrogen.  Crystal structure, 
morphology, crystallization and melting behaviour of PEEK have been extensively 
studied by several authors [20-28].  PEEK was found to exhibit crystallization 
behaviour and spherulitic growth similar to poly(ethylene terephthalate) [20].  The 
polymers.  The similar lattice and the decreasing crystallinity of the thio-containing 
PEEK demonstrated that the introduction of the sulfide group was not located in the 
lattice and therefore destroyed the regular crystal structure.  The obtained X-ray 
diffraction data illustrate simply the structure of the crystalline region without any 
sulfide group in the lattice.  Otherwise, as compared with the unit cell of neat PEEK 
in the published literature [29], the calculated c-constant of thio-containing PEEK 
polymers are slightly longer, indicating that the thio-containing blocks, though outside 
the crystalline, has an extended effect on the main chain.  
Differential Scanning Calorimetric Analysis 
     As shown in Figure 5, melting points (Tms) of the thio-containing PEEK, 
gradually decreased and then disappeared with the increase of the TDP content in 
TDP/HQ mixture.  The Tm and Tg of the PEEK-related polymers are listed in Table 
II.  Figure 5 demonstrate that Tm of PEEK (Tm=352℃) can be reduced to 237℃ as 
the TDP/HQ ratio is 50/50, which proved that the thio-groups was inserted to form the 
thio-ketone polymers.  As the TDP/HQ ratio in the PEESK is approach to 100%, the 
resultant polymers are not able to crystallize as shown in Figure 5.  It might be 
attributed to the two effects: the more flexible nature of thio-groups than that of the 
ether-group and the size of sulfur atom is much larger than that of the oxygen one, 
which can not match the neat PEEK crystal structure and therefore reduced the 
crystallinity and its melting point.  The depression in the Tm of the thio-containing 
PEEK will be concluded to improve its processing properties.  The Tgs can not 
clearly be detected from DSC for thio-containing PEEK with high crystallinity.  
Therefore, the technique of DMA is adopted to analyze the Tgs of the thio-containing 
PEEK.  The temperature dependence of the loss modulus (E′′) and storage modulus 
(E′) curves are shown in Figure 6 and 7, respectively.  The peak temperatures of the 
E′′ curves of the thio-containing PEEK are considered as the Tg of the resultant 
polymers and are listed in Table II.  The apparent depression of the Tg and E′ values 
with an increase in TDP contents were observed in the thio-containing PEEK.  The 
depression of Tg and E′ values is due to the introduction of the more flexible C-S-C 
bond into the resultant polymers. 
     The thermal stability of the thio-containing PEEK polymers was investigated by 
the TGA.  The resultant curves are illustrated in Figure 8.  It can be seen that the 
topography and phase images acquired simultaneously of Nafion117 and 
thio-containing PEEK that had been previously immersed in water and methanol. The 
lighter regions of each image correspond to areas of greater stiffness.] Published AFM 
studies of Nafion 117 reveal very similar phase data with areas of light and dark 
domains Other researchers who have studied phase images of the acid form of Nafion 
115 and the potassium form of Nafion 117 have concluded that bright spots in 
very-high magnification phase images are attributable to ionic clusters, and dark spots 
are attributable to fluorocarbon domains, because the intensity of the bright spots 
depends on the water content. Therefore, the light areas are believed to correspond to 
aggregates of sulfonic acid moieties, which aid proton movement through the 
membrane and may also be present in the Nafion 117 and thio-containing PEEK as 
the phase images reveal. Furthermore, in these AFM phase images, the bright 
structures had larger phase lag and were assigned to a softer region, which represents 
the hydrophilic sulfonic acid groups containing a larger fraction of water; dark phase 
structure were assigned to a harder region, which represents the hydrophobic aromatic 
and alkyl structure. Thus, thio-containing PEEK (Fig. 9b,it was clearly seen that the 
hydrophilic ionic domains were segregated in an essentially a reticulated venous form 
in the non-ionic hydrophobic matrix. The reticulated venous structure significantly 
increased the mechanical properties of the thio-containing PEEK membranes, 
resulting in a sharp rise in the water uptake at room temperature.
