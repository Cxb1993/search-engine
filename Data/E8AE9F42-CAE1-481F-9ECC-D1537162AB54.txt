the sectors of one BS. Although, compared to intra-site CoMP, inter-site CoMP
would be much harder to realize due to existing challenges such as clustering,
scheduling, synchronization, backhaul overhead, channel state information (CSI)
feedback load and CSI estimation accuracy [1], the design of inter-site CoMP
still attracts many research attention as it provides promising gains in system
throughput [1]. To fully exploit the potential of inter-site CoMP processing,
the coordinated BSs should jointly transmit to multiple SSs, where each SS is
simultaneously served by coordinated BSs and therefore both data and channel
state information (CSI) are exchanged between the BSs [1]. In this case the
coordinated system actually becomes a single-cell multi-antenna system which
is known as a virtual MIMO network, and existing downlink beamforming approach
has been proposed in [2]. The main issue with [2] is that this scheme requires
data sharing between the BSs, which is forbidden when limited backhaul is allowed.
Motivated by this, [3] looked into coordinated beamforming (BF) schemes without
data sharing among the BSs.
In spite of the potential of inter-site CoMP processing, the tradeoffs
between the cost to provide CSI at the transmitter (CSIT), estimation error,
and system resource allocated to training appears that the number of antennas
that can be jointly coordinated (either on the same BS or across multiple BSs)
is essentially limited [4]. In addition, to avoid executing the complex BF design
for multiple BSs joint processing, limited MIMO network coordination is more
practical and still yields a significant throughput gain, e.g., throughput
increases to a factor of 2.5 by coordinating a cluster of seven cells [5]. For
these purposes, several cells form a cluster, and a cluster control unit (CU)
exists to collect CSIs, perform beamforming design and coordinate coherent
transmissions in this system. Specifically, an adaptive clustering algorithm
is required. Field trial results show that in spite of various aforementioned
implementation constraints downlink CoMP transmission still can be realized in
real-world scenarios and that significant gain can still be achieved by forming
small coordinated clusters in large-scale networks [1]. An extension and
analysis of CoMP architecture in large multi-cell networks is also proposed and
investigated in [6].
Due to the essential constraints on CSI feedback, synchronization and the
number of antennas that can be jointly coordinated, the CoMP architecture is
often discussed for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) system.
A scheduling algorithm is required to jointly allocate the subcarriers for SSs
in different cells of a CoMP system [7]. In LTE-Advanced context, subcarriers
are allocated in blocks of adjacent subcarriers, which represent the Physical
Resource Blocks (PRBs). Channel coherence bandwidth is assumed larger than the
bandwidth of a PRB leading to flat fading over each PRB. Several PRBs exist in
a coordinated system and each of them might be allocated to one or more SSs.
This kind of resource allocation problem of spatially reusing PRBs within a CoMP
region is investigated [7].
I.1 Robust BF design for the CoMP Downlink Case

transmitting nodes. The other one focuses on interference cancellation only by
having global CSIs at the CU. Nonetheless, to fully exploit the potential of
coordinated transmission, the CU requires to have the global CSI knowledge, which
incurs overhead for channel estimation and feedback. Considering the
difficulties for acquiring global CSI, coordinated beamforming design
considering partial CSIs at the CU is widely discussed. In the process of
acquiring the CSI, the channels are first estimated by the SSs and then are
quantized and fed back to the CU. Hence, the available CSIs at the CU are subject
to uncertainties that mainly arise from estimation error and channel
quantization. With a good estimator and small amount of bits reserved for
quantized CSI feedback in the next-generation cellular wireless networks,
quantization error is very likely a dominant source of error about the CSIs.
To overcome this, we also consider a bounded uncertainty model in the CSIs
at the CU. This model is a useful one for systems with low-rate feedback channel
[15]. For this bounded channel uncertainty model, we design a BF that minimizes
the transmitted power required to ensure that each SS’s SINR requirement is
satisfied for all channels within the specified uncertainty region. In this kind
of worst-case analysis, which we discuss in this paper, the uncertainty possesses
no statistical properties. Similar worst-case analysis considering bounded
error model can also be founded in [16–19].
On the other hand, stochastic robustness analysis, in which the error model
assumed possessing statistical properties has also been investigated in [20,
21]. In contrast, a distributed beamforming design is carried out to avoid the
overhead from another point of view based on a non-cooperative game theory
proposed [22]. The main idea of non-cooperative game theory is that each SS may
try to compete for the scarce resource and optimize its own performance based
on its local CSIs.
Because of the limitation of the number of antennas that can be jointly
coordinated, we assume each PRB of can only be assigned to one SS in a cell and
served by its associated BS and RS via this PRB. With this assumption, we discuss
our coordinated downlink beamforming design under a cooperation group composed
of several cells at each of which a single BS and a amplify-and-forward (AF)
RS are located. A two-cell cooperation group is illustrated in Fig. 1.1 and
Fig. 1.2.
Figure 1.1: Topology of a two-cell cooperation group.

Despite the rich results about the worst-case analysis of
amplify-and-forward relaying for bounded error model [26], [27], robust
beamforming based on integration of coordinated BS transmission and RS
retransmission has not been studied. We first formulate the robust BF designs
considering herein as a Semi-definite Programming (SDP) based on the S-Procedure
[28] and semi-definite relaxation (SDR) [29]. We then develop necessary
conditions for the optimal beamforming for the robust BF problem and develop
a suboptimal and nearly closed-form expression of the BFer based on a two-tier
iterated QCQP. The SDR-based beamforming method is shown by simulations to
achieve the near optimal performance. And the performance of the low-complexity
suboptimal scheme based on the iterated QCQP is shown to be very close to that
with the SDR approach, and is much friendly for practical implementations.
Simulation results also show that the downlink throughput for SSs close to cell
boundaries of the multi-cell system can be drastically improved via CoMP AF
relaying. The proposed robust CoMP AF BF methods is a promising scheme to
compromise the two factors of performance, the system power consumption and the
feasibility to support QoS in ARQs.
I.2 Precoder Design for DF Relaying over CoMP Uplink Channel
For the other issue, we apply a relay-based cooperative scheme in a
multi-cell uplink network. Employing relays in the system can have many benefits
such as enhancing transmission coverage, exploiting the spatial diversity and
other benefits. On the other hand, it also can efficiently improve the received
SINR at destination. However, if we without sophisticated arguments directly
deploy traditional relaying schemes in the 4G systems, the uplink transmission
efficiency would decrease with the number of SSs, because a relay node equipped
with a single antenna can serve only one subscriber each transmission round from
the viewpoint of the degree of freedom. Recently, there are some relaying schemes
that use the network coding to avoid this drawback [44, 47, 56-57]. Generally
speaking, the ideal of using network coding was proposed for noiseless wireless
networks to enhance their capacity [41]. The authors in [48] make use of the
max-flow min-cut theory to derive the capacity of the network using linear
network coding. In [59], the author proposed a practical network coding and
further implemented it. Simulations in [59] show that the scheme with this coding
method can almost achieve the proposed theoretical optimal performance. Besides,
more and more publications extend the network coding method to applications of
wireless cooperative communications, such as XOR network coding [44], nonlinear
network coding [57], analog network coding [47], and complex field network coding
[56]. Due to the broadcasting nature of wireless networks, network coding becomes
more and more useful in the field of cooperative communications.
Besides, Wang and Giannakis' publication [56] combines the complex field
network coding methods and precoder mechanism. The complex field network coding
method can provide higher degree of freedom than other network coding methods.
In their scenario, the relay node has users-to-relay and relay-to-destination
CSIs to design the precoder by itself. This precoding method performs well and
is easy to use when the channel qualities between each user and the destination

II. COMP DOWNLINK AF BEAFORMING DESIGN
II.1 Transmission Protocol and Problem Setting for CoMP Downlink AF Beamforming
We discuss our coordinated downlink beamforming design under a cooperation
group of N cells, each of which consists of a single BS, an amplify-and-forward
(AF) RS and a SS. The topology of a three-cell cooperation group is shown in
Fig. 3. To maintain the signal quality received at the RSs, RSs are placed between
the BSs and the SSs, and are still in a fair distance away from their cell
boundaries to overhear and forward signals to SSs near the cell boundaries.
Consequently, the interferences to a RS from the BSs of its adjacent cells are
very small. Next, we carefully show transmission mechanism, challenges and our
solutions in this system.
Figure 3: Topology of a three-cell cooperation group.
The transmission scheme of a cooperation group is introduce below based on
a two-cell example as shown in Fig. 4, and this example can be generalized to
N-cell cases. In the first transmission round of a cooperation group, the
scheduler would first choose two SSs in different cells and then coordinate BSs
in this group to transmit data to these SSs. At the end of transmission round,
SSs would decode the packet and detect the error. If both the SSs detect errors,
scheduler would coordinate RSs to retransmit data to these SSs in the next
transmission round. If both the SSs do not detect any error, scheduler would
coordinate BSs to continue transmitting data to these SSs. However, if only one
SS detect errors, scheduler would choose a new parter for them respectively to
form a new direct transmission group and retransmission group.

II.2 System Model for CoMP AF Beamforming
Under the system architecture introduced previously, RSs of a cell receive
signals only from their associated BS. In contrast, a SSi close to the edge of
its cell Ci, will receive its desired signal from BSi or its associated RSi, and
meanwhile pick up interferences from BSj or RSj,8j 6= i6 . To suppress the
interferences efficiently in coordinated transmissions without data sharing,
each BS or RS must be at least equipped with N antennas (We assume just N
antennas in this paper), while each SS is assumed having one antenna only. Besides,
we assume perfect channel state information at the receiver (CSIR), while partial
CSI at the CU caused by quantization error is considered. Also, we assume RSs
have complete knowledge of their own BF matrices.
Here, we just illustrate system models for coordinated BSs transmission and
coordinated RSs retransmission. Signals sent from BSs and received by SSi can
be modeled as

Furthermore, given , hbi;ri, and hrj ;si, 8i; j, the beamformers Wri for RSi can
be jointly designed to meet the target SINR °0 as well, according to SINR
constrained power minimization problem of relay stations (SPMP-RS).

The design methodology outlined in SPMP-BS and SPMP-RS requires the full CSI
for hbj ;si, hrj ;si and hbj ;si, 8i; j.
To cope with the influences of channel quantization error, we study robust
BF designs to maintain the SINR for each SS. Considering the uncertainties of
hbj ;si, hrj ;si and hbj ;si in our designs, they are modeled as
hbj ;si , ¹hbj;si + ebj ;si 8i; j (7)
hrj ;si , ¹hrj;si + erj;si 8i; j (8)

where ¹hbj ;si, ¹hrj ;si and ¹hbi;ri are quantized channel available at the CU, and ebj;si
and erj;si 2 CN£1 and ebi;ri 2 CN£1 are their associated unknown uncertainty
vectors or matrices. According to the uncertainty models, the design criterion
for wbi is modified into robust SINR constrained power minimization problem of
base stations (RSPMP-BS)

Considering channel quantization error, ebi;ri are actually influence the
total transmit power of relays, Pr, and make it fluctuate even BF matrix Wri

the maximal transmit power. Hence, we reconsider a robust design criterion for

optimal BF vector, for arbitrary µi, 8i. Thus, without the loss of generality
(w.l.o.g.), one can assume that (ei ÐpdihHri;si)w ¸ 0, where ei is a N-dimensional
unit vector with one for the i-th entry and zeros elsewhere. As a result, the

TSPMP-RS can be cast into the form of the standard second order cone programming
(SOCP) [30] which can be solved by available optimization solvers, e.g. CVX [31].
However, the general-purpose solvers are typically computationally inefficient
for a specific optimization problem like TSPMP-RS. To reduce the complexity for
CoMP AF BF, we propose a nearly closed-form method for solving TSPMP-RS, which
is summarized in the following proposition.

more insight into the problem, we then provide necessary conditions for
optimality in the following proposition, and suggest a simple two-tier fixed
point iteration (as shown in the following algorithm) based on iterated quadratic
constraints quadratic programming (QCQP) concept for finding the variables that
satisfy them.
The SDR-based beamforming method is shown by simulations to achieve the
nearly optimal performance. And the performance of the low-complexity suboptimal
scheme based on the iterated QCQP is shown to be very close to that with the
SDR approach, and is more friendly for practical implementations.

The problem above ensures that every SS will be served with an SINR at least
better than the target SINR, °0, for all channel uncertainties, erj ;si, whose
kerj ;sik · ²r;s. This, in fact, will impose an infinite number of non-convex
constraints in this problem. Although the non-convex constraints can be
transformed into convex ones with a method similar to what employed in section
II.3, the approach used in Proposition 1 is still not capable of dealing with
an infinite number of convex constraints. Hence, to solve TRSPMP-RS, the first
challenge is to transform the infinite constraints into finite ones. We, in the
sequel, present two methods to overcome the difficulty, which lead to two
different approaches for solving TRSPMP-RS.
II.4.1 RSPMP-RS based on the S-Procedure and SDR
Following a procedure similar to what presented in [32-34], the infinite
表 C011 共 52 頁 第 19 頁
The above SDR problem can be solved with the available optimization solvers
such as SeDuMe or CVX [31,35]. In fact, the beamformers obtained with the SDR
approach are optimal if they satisfy the rank-one condition. Although the
resultant Wri, are not guaranteed to be rank-one 8i, by inspection from our
simulations, we notice that the solutions always satisfy the rank-one condition.
Similar observations have been previously reported in [32-34]. Thus, the above
SDR approach (23) can be practically considered as an nearly optimal solver for
RSPMP-RS.
II.4.1 RSPMP-RS based on Iterated QCQP
The SDR-based approach presented in the previous section is elegant and
provides a practically nearly optimal solver. However, the approach relies on
a numerical toolbox which is not always available and less friendly for practical
implementations. Motivated by the results in [36,37], among others, we present
in the sequel a more intuitive and commonly used approach to relieve the infinite
number of constraints in TRSPMP-RS, making use of the triangular and the
Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities. Nevertheless, to resolve the conservativeness
often seen in this approach, we introduce a number of auxiliary variables to
ensure the tightness in the process of constraint relaxations, which together
with a new formulation for programming leads to a nearly closed-form suboptimal
solver. The suboptimal solver presents a performance very close to the one
obtained with the SDR-approach in (23), yet is more computationally efficient
and friendly for practical implementations. Moreover, it provides us an insight
into the structure of the robust CoMP AF beamformers. Details of the derivations
are presented below and in the Appendix C.
Recall TRSPMP-RS. To relieve the infinite number of constraints in
programming, we need to bound the effects of uncertainties in Di;i, and Dj;i of
(17) for all possible erj ;si that satisfy kerj ;sik · ²r;s, 8i; j. Observing the form of
Dj;i in (17), erj ;si are embedded in erj ;si which can be upper bounded with the
Cauchy-Schwarz inequality as follows
jeHrj ;siwrj j · kerj ;sikkwrjk · ²r;skwrjk 8i; j: (27)
This upper bound is in fact tight for TRSPMP-RS as there exist erj ;si that
just make the inequlities also satisfy equality. Substituting this upper bound
into Di;i followed by some mathematical manipulations, we obtain
Di;i = j(¹hri;si + eri;si)Hwrij2 ¸ (j¹hHri;siwrij ¡ jeHri;siwrij)2
¸ j¹hHri;siwrij2 ¡ 2²r;uj¹hHri;siwrijk ~wrik + ²2r;skwrik2
(28)
if j¹hHri;siwri j ¸ ²r;skwrik, This lower bound can further be expressed in a quadratic
form if we define some parameters vi;i, 8i, such thatj¹hHri;siwHri j · vi;ik¹hri;sikkwrik,

The details of the proof are summarized in the Appendix C. The proposition
provides a simple strategy for finding the primal and dual variables that satisfy
the KKT conditions. Given a feasible SINR requirement and channel uncertainty
radius , all one has to do is to find the pairs of primal and dual variables
satisfying all the equations in Proposition 3. The structure of the equations
motivates us to find the solutions by fixed point iterations as (15). The entire
procedure is summarized in Algorithm 1.

III. PRECODER DESIGN FOR COMP UPLINK DF RELAYING
III.1.1 the Uplink Model
Figure 6: The system model has two cellular. Each cellular has one source, one relay,
and one destination.
The system model is showed on Figure 1. The wireless relay network consists
of two subscribers, two relays, and two base stations. All the nodes are equipped
with single antenna, and are opperated with half-duplex mode. Besides, the two
subscribers, belonging to different cells , prepare to transmit the signals to
their own base station, and all can be assisted by the relay nodes, respectively.
表 C011 共 52 頁 第 25 頁
BS will get poor performance.
III.1.2 the Error Analysis
The error propagation casused by relay also influences the detection
performance at BS because the relay doesn't check the correctness before
transmission. So, the error probability at base station must be conditional on
whether the relay detects the subscriber’s signal successfully or not.
Therefore, there are four possible constellation points for relay; namely,
dR1 = hS1Rb1x1 + hS2Rb2x2
dR2 = hS1Rb1x1 ¡ hS2Rb2x2
dR3 = ¡hS1Rb1x1 + hS2Rb2x2
dR4 = ¡hS1Rb1x1 ¡ hS2Rb2x2
(51)
where the second line in (51) means the constellation point which the SS1
transmits x1 and the SS2 transmits ¡x2. The probabilities of the four cases can
be calculated using the union bound. For instance, if the SS1 and SS2 transmit
x1 and x2, respectively and the relay detects them as x1 and ¡x2, then the
probability can be expressed as
P(x1;x2);(x1;¡x2) = Q

where jdR1 ¡ dR2 j means the Euclidean distance between the two constellation
point dR1 and dR2. The last expression in (52) is due to the use of the Chernoff
bound, Q (x) · 12 exp

(53)
Although the upper bounds are not tight within low SNR region, the diversity
order still can be attained at high SNR region. The union bound is only associated
with the symbol distance. So, they can be analyzed using the same method.
Originally, the BSs apply the ML detection principle for the received signals
from the subscriber nodes and relay node. The ML rule can be expressed as
(x^1; x^2)D1 = arg max(x1;x2)2S(M)

the optimization technique to solve this complicated problem. The optimization
of exponential functions might be solved by GP. However,the GP requires a form
of posynomial functions for the exponent term. And our formulation still does
not satisfy the requirement. Thus, we use another more powerful optimization
method which is called SP. The SP is an extension version of the GP and it's
a nonlinear optimization method. In this section, we introduce the standard form
and properties of GP at first. Second, the form of SP and transformation skills
are presented.
The standard form of GP is to minimize a posynomial function subject to
posynomial upper bound inequality constraints and monomial equality constraints.
In othe words, the form can be expressed as
minimize f0 (x)
subject to fi (x) · 1; i = 1; : : : ; m
hl (x) = 1; l = 1; : : : M

which is a sum of monomials.
Note that the domain of monomials is strictly positive quadrant of <n, where
the objective functions and constraint functions are writing in terms of
monomials, The domain of monomials implies that the optimal variables cannot
be zero. GP in standard form isn't a convex optimization problem, because
posynomials aren't convex functions. It can be used a logarithmic change of all
variables and becomes a convex optimization problem. The details doesn't
introduce in this work.
For this problem, the objective function isn't a posynomial function. We
can't directly use the GP for the problem. In the problem, the objective function
and constraint functions are polynomials division. Polynomial is a form of
posynomial with negative multiplicative coefficients. It can be divided to two
parts which are monomials terms with positive multiplicative coefficients and
negative multiplicative coefficients. Each parts are posynomial function and
can applied the SP to optimize. The form of SP is
minimize f01 (x) ¡ f02 (x)
subject to fi1 (x) ¡ fi2 (x) · 1; i = 1; : : : ; m (76)
where fi1; i = 1; : : : ; m are separated from those monomial terms with positive
multiplicative coefficients and it's a posynomial function. We need to convert
the signomial objective function into the form by GP. In table 1, we can see
that the major difference between GP and SP lies in the multiplicative
coefficients and other parameters are almost the same. Let t be an auxiliary

Given ~x > 0, we will choose the set of weights which is based on the
arithmetic-geometric inequality:
!ik (~x) =
uik (~x)
fi (~x)
(87)
There is an important property of the above result which the fi(x; ~x) is a monomial
function. The condensed posynomial must rule by the arithmetic-geometric
inequality :
fi (x; ~x) · fi (x) (88)
for any positive x and ~x.
Recall the problem of (81). We can apply the condensed programs to the
denominator of the constraints. And it can be translated as:
t + f02 (x) ¸ f0 (x; ~x1)
1 + fi2 (x) ¸ fi (x; ~x2) (89)
And the optimization problem will be :
minimize t
subject to f01(x)f0(x;~x1) · 1
fi1(x)
fi(x;~x2)
· 1; i = 1; : : : ;m
(90)
The program has the following properties :
1) the (90) is a standard form of GP because all constraints are posynomial
function.
2) At any point, ~x1 and ~x2 satisfy the constraints of (90) will satisfy the
constraints of (81). This can be observed by the inequality (88), i.e.:
f01(x)
t+f02(x)
· f01(x)f0(x;~x1) · 1
fi1(x)
1+fi2(x)
· fi1(x)f1(x;~x2) · 1
(91)
3) Inequality (91) implies that the feasible set of (90) is fully constrained
in (81). So, the optimal solution to (90) will be a feasible solution
to (81).
Based on the above introducing of SP, we want to apply it to our problem.
In the previous section, we get a BER function which is formed by exponential

IV. SIMULATION STUDIES
IV.1 the Downlink Case
Figure 7: An illustration for a subnetwork of 3 SSs.
We demonstrate throughput enhancement via simulations with the proposed CoMP
AF BF methods in a multi-cell network. The effectiveness of the proposed robust
CoMP AF BF algorithms are compared with the non-robust ones from the perspectives
of power consumption and the feasibility of the beamformers. A system topology
for a subnetwork of N = 3 is illustrated in Fig. 7. To model and investigate
the effects of pathloss, the SSs are set to move altogether along the directions

Figure 8: Simulated throughput when N=3 and `0 = 0: (a) Order of path loss=3 (b) Order of path
loss=4. The variance of channel between BSs and RSs and of AWGN noise are both assumed as one.
Fig. 9 (a) presents the throughput of different types of schemes versus the
total transmit power P0 when all the SSs are located at the boundary corner,
namely, `0 = 0. On the other hand, Fig. 9 (b) shows the effect of pathloss on
throughput versus `0, given P0 = 10 dB. In both figures, when the total transmit
power P0 is low or when the SSs are close to the boundary corner, the
relay-assisted CoMP system outperforms the direct CoMP system without the
assistance of relays even if the BF matrices are formed simply based on the
zero-forcing criterion. Moreover, when the total transmit power P0 is high or
when the SSs are far away from the boundary corner, the relay-assisted CoMP system
also outperforms the two-hop relaying. Besides, the beamformers designed based
on the max-min SINR criterion (50) are apparently more effective than those
designed based on the zero-forcing criterion.
(a) (b)
Figure 9: Simulated throughput when N=3: (a) `0 = 0 (b) P0 = 10 dB.
We demonstrate next the effectiveness of the robust CoMP AF BF designs. And
the results are averaged over 1000 channel realizations. The SSs are evaluated
at the cell edge, i.e., `0 = 0. In addition, to assess the feasibility of CoMP
AF relaying, a BF scheme is considered infeasible for a certain channel
realization if it can not ensure each SSs' SINR requirement for any CSIs error
within uncertainty region given 60 dB total transmission power budget; otherwise,
it is called a feasible one.
On the other hand, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the robust BFs,
non-robust CoMP BFs are also proposed for comparison. Unlike robust BF,
non-robust ones just neglect the existence of channel quantization error or only
consider the existence of channel quantization error of some links. For clarity,
considering ²r;s > 0 and ²b;r = 0, non-robust AF BFs are designed based on SPMP-RS
rather than RSPMP-RS. In addition, considering ²r;s > 0 and ²b;r > 0, non-robust

(b) shows the feasible rates of these BF schemes.
(a) (b)
Figure 12: Subplot (a) shows the average power consumptions versus the target SINR, °0, and
subplot (b) presents the feasible rates versus °0, both at ² = 0:1.
Without RSs, BSs are also able to retransmit data. However, apparently,
relaying not only can reduce the system power consumption, but also can increase
the feasibility to support QoS in ARQs even with the low-complexity AF relaying.
Besides, the proposed robust CoMP BF scheme is more power efficient and feasible
to support QoS subject to uncertainties in CSI in a multi-cell environment. The
advantages of the robust CoMP BF lie in its two figures that the robust scheme
first finds the channel uncertainty which yields the worst SINR, and then
minimizing the total transmit power subject to a SINR constraint under the
specific channel uncertainty. In contrast, a beamformer designed without this
robust mechanism would rather blindly increase its transmit power in order to
meet the target SINR for all possible uncertainties, which often ends up
enhancing the interferences rather than increasing the desired signal power,
leading to a higher power consumption and a lower feasible rate. Fig. 13 compares
the feasible rates for various schemes versus the upper limit, ²r;s, on the 2-norms
of the channel uncertainties. Clearly, the robust CoMP BF schemes outperform
the non-robust ones in all cases of ²r;s.

minimize the function (22). The curve “ML with Exhaustive Search” and “CVX”
show almost the same BEP performance. But the “CVX” is a precise and efficient
method to find a solution for the power allocation. Compared with Wang and
Giannakis' CNFC method, both “ML with Exhaustive Search” and “CVX” have 3dB
gain in BER performance. The curve Simplification detection with “p1 = 1 and
p2 = 1” shows that the BEPs of the MS1 of the cells without designing the power
allocation precoders for the RS. In this situation, the MS can't exploit full
diversity at the corresponding BS. The last curve "One user bound" represents
a performance metric based on the MS1 doesn't suffer any interference. And our
scheme can almost achieve this performance bound.

of all users.
In Fig.19, the network topology is set as 2D1 = D2 = D3 = D. The topology
would happen when the MSs in Figure 4 are located on the cellular boundary. In
this situation, applying our method the MS1 and MS2 can achieve the same
performance as they do by Wang and Giannakis' precoder. As the same result in
Fig.18, our performance in BER is 3dB better than Wang and Giannakis' CNFC method.

V. CONCLUSIONS
Two types of robust CoMP AF BF methods were proposed to support QoS in ARQs
for downlink multi-cell networks. The proposed CoMP BF methods do not require
data exchanges between different cells of the network, and are able to maintain
QoS in ARQs subject to imperfect CSI feedbacks. The SDR-based BF method was shown
by simulations to achieve the optimal performance. And the performance of the
low-complexity suboptimal scheme based on the iterated QCQP was shown to be very
close to that with the SDR approach, and is more friendly for practical
implementations. Simulation results show that the downlink throughput for users
close to cell boundaries of the multi-cell system can be drastically improved
via CoMP AF relaying. Besides, the proposed robust CoMP BF methods not only can
reduce the system power consumption, but also can increase the feasibility to
support QoS in ARQs even with the low-complexity AF relaying.
On the other hand, we also introduced a power allocation method for the
uplink DF relaying to provide differentiated services in a CoMP network. Based
on our simulation results, the services are achievable in the CoMP system, and
the diversity order of the BER at BS for SS also is guaranteed. Besides, the
SP method offer an efficient way to design the power allocation for the relays.
APPENDIX
1. APPENDIX A
To present our CoMP AF BF algorithms designed according to SPMP-RS, we first
define a number of notations for matrices to be used frequently in the sequel.
Specifically, we have Qi , hbi;rihHbi;ri, mj;i , ([hbj ;rj ]1hHrj ;si ; : : : ; [hbj ;rj ]NhHrj ;si)H, and
~wri , vec(Wri). Following these definitions, the power consumption, Pr, used for
the CoMP AF BF in SPMP-RS can be expressed as
