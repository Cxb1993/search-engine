Composites of nano- Pt particles and polyaniline doped 
with polyelectrolytes containing carboxylic acid for 
direct methanol fuel cells 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC) are highly attractive power sources for a variety of applications 
due to their high energy efficiency, low emissions, low noise, and environmental friendliness [1-8]. DMFCs 
are based on methanol electro-oxidation at the anode. Among the numerous materials used for the anode of 
DMFCs, Pt has been established as a powerful electrocatalyst for the oxidation of methanol [9,10]. However, 
the use of Pt in the form of smooth foils for the direct electro-oxidation of methanol has been found to be 
inefficient due to (i) high cost and (ii) the formation of strongly adsorbed intermediates such as CO (referred 
to as COads) as a result of the dissociative adsorption of methanol [11]. 
In order to mitigate COads-like poisoning, various strategies have been developed to improve the 
electrocatalytic activity for methanol electro-oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions, including the addition 
or incorporation of a second element into Pt electrocatalysts, such as catalyst supporters [12,13]. It has been 
shown that the use of conducting polymers (CPs) as a catalyst supporter is a simple and useful way of 
reducing catalyst poisoning. CPs in their various oxidation states interconvert each other, which allows a 
redox cycle to form for catalytic reactions. Thus, the electrochemical deposition of metals on electrodes 
modified with CP films is a convenient and inexpensive route for developing anode materials. Studies on CPs 
as host materials for Pt nanoparticles have focused on polyaniline (PANI) [14,15], polypyrrole (PPy) [16,17], 
and polythiophene (PT) [18] for methanol oxidation. The advantage of using CPs over other materials is that 
they are permeable to electroactive species, sufficiently conductive for current flow between the solution and 
substrate, easily modified using various techniques, and easy to coat onto various substrates. CPs also act as 
electrocatalyst and current collectors. 
Poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PSS), a polymer acid, has been shown to be easily incorporated in a CP 
matrix as a dopant as a support for Pt particles. Huang et al. [19] reported that PANI-PSS acts as a matrix that 
leads to the uniform distribution of Pt particles. As a result, the electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation 
of PANI-PSS-Pt is much higher than that of PANI-Pt. Kuo et al. [20] reported that highly dispersed Pt 
particles became homogeneously distributed in a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrene sulfonic acid) 
(PEDOT-PSS) matrix. However, these investigations mainly focused on the manufacture of PSS as a dopant 
in a CP matrix; less attention has been given to the processing of a CP modified with a polymer acid 
containing carboxylic acid groups for use as a supporting material in DMFCs. 
In the present study, a simple simultaneous doping-deposition method is used to introduce -CO2H 
groups (poly(acrylic acid), PAA) and HCl with Pt4+ ions into a PANI matrix. PANI doped simultaneously with 
PAA and HCl forms a spatial network structure, which behaves as a 3D-random matrix for the deposition of 
Pt particles. We believe that PANI-(PAA+HCl) may act as a stabilizer for Pt particles, preventing their 
aggregation. The PANI-(PAA+HCl)-Pt composite is expected to enhance electroactivity for methanol 
oxidation.

Electrochemical characterizations of PANI-(PAA+HCl)-Pt and PANI-HCl-Pt composite electrodes 
were carried out using an CHI627D electrochemical analyzer (U.S.A.). All experiments were performed in a 
three-component cell. An Ag/AgCl electrode (in 3 M KCl), Pt wire, and SS (1-cm2 area) were used as the 
reference, counter, and working electrodes, respectively. A Luggin capillary, whose tip was set at a distance of 
1-2 mm from the surface of the working electrode, was used to minimize errors due to iR drop in the 
electrolytes. 
 
2.4. Methanol Electro-oxidation and Stability of PANI-(PAA+HCl)-Pt composite electrode  
The catalytic activities of PANI-(PAA+HCl)-Pt and PANI-HCl-Pt composite electrodes were 
examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) at 10 mV sec-1 ranging from -0.2 to 1.0 V. Chronoamperometric 
response curves were obtained at 0.6 V in 0.1 M CH3OH + 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. All the electrochemical 
experiments were carried out at room temperature. 
 
 
 
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
3.1. Characterizations of PANI-(PAA+HCl)  
An investigation was made into the charge transport mechanism in the PANI-(PAA+HCl)-Pt and 
PANI-HCl-Pt composite electrodes at various scan rates (v) by linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs). The 
double logarithmic plots of peak current versus v (Fig. 1) for the two types of electrode are linear with nearly 
identical slopes. It is known that the linearity of a plot of peak current versus v corresponds to the 
surface-bound transport process and a different type of linear for the plot of peak current versus v1/2 signifies a 
diffusion control process [22]. The slope values of the double logarithmic plots are 0.95 and 1.03 for 
PANI-HCl and PANI-(PAA+HCl), respectively. Thus, the PANI-HCl and PANI-(PAA+HCl) composite 
electrodes have surface-bound transport processes. 
XPS analyses of the surfaces of PANI-HCl and PANI-(PAA+HCl) were conducted to investigate 
variations at nitrogen binding sites. Fig. 2 shows the XPS spectra of core-level N1s for PANI-HCl and 
PANI-(PAA+HCl). The signals of N1s were fitted with peaks at 398.8, 399.6, 400.7, and 401.8 eV, which 
correspond to quinonoid imine (=N-), benzenoid amine (-NH-), protonated amine (-N+), and protonated imine 
(=N+), respectively [23]. Kumar et al. [24,25] attributed the last two peaks to the presence of polarons (radical 
cations) and bipolarons (dications). The ratio of these two N1s components at 400.7 and 401.8 eV (positively 
charged nitrogen atoms) can be considered as a direct estimation of the doping level of PANI [26]. The area 
ratios of the four nitrogen constituents in PANI were calculated; their results are listed in Table 1. The doping 
level for PANI-(PAA+HCl) (27 %) is higher than that observed for PANI-HCl (23 %) due to the existence of 
PAA.

3.2. Electrodeposition of Pt into PANI-(PAA+HCl)  
Pt particles were incorporated into PANI-HCl and PANI-(PAA+HCl) films by electrochemical 
deposition at a constant potential of -0.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) with a charge of 0.15 C. Fig. 3a shows SEM 
micrographs of the surface morphology of PANI-HCl, PANI-(PAA+HCl), PANI-HCl-Pt, and 
PANI-(PAA+HCl)-Pt electrodes. The nanowire morphology for PANI-HCl and PANI-(PAA+HCl) films is 
clearly evident in Fig. 3a(I-II). The PANI-HCl nanowires have an average diameter of 30-60 nm. 
PANI-(PAA+HCl) nanowires have a larger diameter (50-80 nm) with a smooth surface due to the influence of 
PAA molecules on PANI. It is to be noted that the incorporation of PAA into PANI did not change the 
nanowire morphology. The nanowire morphology of PANI-(PAA+HCl) provides a large surface area for the 
subsequent deposition of Pt particles. We believe that Pt particles are incorporated into PANI-HCl and 
PANI-(PAA+HCl) nanowire network structures. Pt particles with a size of about 100 nm can be seen in the 
PANI-HCl-Pt composite electrode (Fig. 3a(III)), whereas no Pt particles are visible in the 
PANI-(PAA+HCl)-Pt electrode, possibly due to their small size (Fig. 3a(IV)). Even though the loading of Pt 
particles was low (76 μg), Pt particles can be clearly seen on the PANI-HCl nanowires. Pt mapping analysis 
for PANI-HCl-Pt and PANI-(PAA+HCl)-Pt electrodes indicates the existence of Pt (Fig. 3a inset). Fig. 3b(I-II) 
show a TEM micrograph of Pt particles embedded into PANI-HCl and PANI-(PAA+HCl) nanowires, 
respectively. The black spots indicate of Pt in PANI-HCl and PANI-(PAA+HCl). The aggregation of Pt 
particles can be clearly seen on PANI-HCl-Pt electrodes. The particle size of Pt (20-90 nm) for the 
PANI-(PAA+HCl)-Pt electrode is smaller than that for the PANI-HCl-Pt electrode, which gives the former 
electrode a higher active surface area. The CO2- groups of PAA uptake Pt4+ ions and HCl into the PANI matrix 
and PANI-(PAA+HCl) matrix, which prevents the aggregation of Pt nanoparticles after Pt formation.

The incorporation of Pt into PANI-HCl and PANI-(PAA+HCl) films was examined using depth 
profiles of Pt particles obtained with AES (Fig. 4). There is a definite difference in the distribution of particles 
in PANI-HCl-Pt and PANI-(PAA+HCl)-Pt electrodes. The depth profile of Pt in the PANI-HCl matrix (curve a) 
increases in intensity of Pt, reaching a maximum at 2 min. The intensity then decreases rapidly after about 23 
min. In contrast to the PANI-HCl-Pt electrode, Pt in the PANI-(PAA+HCl) matrix (curve b) quickly increases 
in intensity up to a shoulder at 2 min and then increases to a maximum at about 10 min. The intensity then 
decreases slowly after about 23 min. Consequently, Pt particles in the PANI-(PAA+HCl) matrix are more 
uniformly dispersed than those in PANI-HCl. This may be due to the CO2- groups of PAA uptake Pt4+ ions, 
and PANI doped with PAA and HCl form a spatial network structure that acts as a 3D-random matrix and a 
protective layer which prevents the aggregation of Pt particles after Pt formation. The homogenous 
distribution of Pt in the PANI-(PAA+HCl) spatial network structure may increase the utilization of Pt for 
methanol oxidation.

3.3. Scheme of the formation of PANI-(PAA+HCl)-Pt  
Based on the observed synthesis of the composite electrodes, the proposed scheme of the 
“simultaneous doping-deposition” of Pt in the PANI-(PAA+HCl) matrix is shown in Fig. 5. When H2PtCl6, 
HCl, and PAA are mixed well, mobile Pt4+ ions couple with CO2- groups on PAA to form a complex. During 
the dipping of the PANI matrix in a H2PtCl6, HCl, and PAA solution, PANI emeraldine base is simultaneously 
doped with excess CO2- anions on the PAA and Cl- anions of HCl to maintain charge neutrality within the 
PANI phase. The formed complex (Pt4+ with Cl- and CO2-) may become trapped in the PANI matrix. Since Pt 
is deposited via a potentiostatic process, PANI-(PAA+HCl) provides an environment for the dispersion of 
individual Pt particles and keeps the active surface area large. We anticipate that this morphology is suitable 
for DMFC applications. Pt particles dispersed on a carbon black support that are used as a catalyst in DMFCs 
do not provide optimal interparticle spacing for rapid methanol diffusion below the top surface layers, limiting 
the effectiveness of expensive catalysts. Pt particles dispersed in PANI-(PAA+HCl) may be better suited for

Figure 6. Cyclic voltammograms of (a) PANI-HCl-Pt and (b) PANI-(PAA+HCl)-Pt in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution 
with a scanning rate of 10 mV sec-1. 
 
A comparison of cyclic voltammograms for the oxidation of methanol on PANI-(PAA+HCl)-Pt and 
PANI-HCl-Pt electrodes indicates that the oxidation current at the PANI-(PAA+HCl)-Pt electrode is higher 
(curve b) than that at the PANI-HCl-Pt (curve a) electrode. For instance, the maximum anodic peak current 
density (Ia in Table 2) of 25.1 mA cm-2 mg-1 observed for PANI-(PAA+HCl)-Pt electrode at about 0.60 V is 
higher than that for observed for PANI-HCl-Pt (12.1 mA cm-2 mg-1). The better performance of the 
PANI-(PAA+HCl)-Pt electrode toward methanol oxidation may be attributed to the following reasons. Firstly, 
a high surface area for Pt particles is anticipated due to the uniform distribution of Pt particles into PANI 
doped with PAA and HCl, which can twist to form a spatial 3D matrix. Secondly, we anticipate that the 
-CO2H groups in PANI-(PAA+HCl) may act as a stabilizer for Pt particles and prevent the aggregation of Pt 
particles. The PANI-(PAA+HCl) matrix acts as a good medium for the deposition of Pt particles, and increases 
the density of active sites on the electrode surface.

4. CONCLUSIONS 
PANI-(PAA+HCl) porous nanowires were synthesized by simultaneously doping PANI with PAA and 
HCl. The deposited Pt nanoparticles were incorporated into the PANI-(PAA+HCl) nanowire network structure 
to form the PANI-(PAA+HCl)-Pt composite electrode. The -CO2H groups in the PANI-(PAA+HCl) spatial 
structure improve the stability of Pt4+ ions in the polymer matrix, resulting in a homogenous distribution of Pt 
in PANI-(PAA+HCl). The PANI-(PAA+HCl)-Pt electrode exhibits a higher current density and lower onset 
potential toward methanol oxidation than PANI-HCl-Pt. The PANI-(PAA+HCl)-Pt composite electrode is a 
promising material for catalysts for methanol oxidation. The enhanced electrocatalytic activity of Pt in 
PANI-(PAA+HCl) opens up the possibility to using smaller amounts of Pt in DMFC applications.
