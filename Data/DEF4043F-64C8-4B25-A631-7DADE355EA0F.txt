11. Introduction
The axial three-dimensional assignment problem, A3AP for short, is an extension of the
classical two-dimensional assignment problem. Given three disjoint n-sets I = {1, 2,…, n}, J =
{1, 2, …, n} and K = {1, 2, …, n}, consider the set S = {(i, j, k)iI, jJ, kK }, the A3AP
can be stated as the following 0-1 programming problem [1]:

One of the practical interpretations of the (1.1) is the following: Let n jobs be given that must
be performed by n workers on n machines. Here, ijkc is the cost associated with the worker i
performing the job j on machine k. It is required to assign one job to one worker on one
machine so as to minimize the total cost associated with the assignment of all the jobs. In the
model, all ijkc ’sare deterministic numbers. Many authors have developed algorithms to solve
A3AP. Among these authors include Pierskalla [2], Hansen and Kaufman [3], Frieze [4], Balas
and Saltzman [1], Crama and Spieksma [5], Oliveira and Pardalos[8]. Applications of A3AP
can be found in the references [1,2,5,6,7, 8,9].
However, the costs of many real world applications are not deterministic numbers. The
quality of the job may assume to be positively correlated to the input cost, e.g. in form of labor
hour, of the worker on the machine. The highest quality, denoted as ijkq (0 ijkq 1 ), of the
job is also different because of the difference among individual workers and/or machines.
Hence, the costs are defined as nondeterministic values, denoted as ijkc
~ . We further define
ijk as the least value of ijkc~ , and ijk as the least cost of ijkc~ associated with quality ijkq .
Any expense exceeding ijk is wasteful since the quality can no longer be increased. Without
lose of generality, it is assumed that ijk  ijk 0. Using fuzzy theory, we define the
3Defining the qualities of the jobs and the total cost as the performance of the workers and
the manager, respectively. The performance of worker i , denoted as i, will be
i= i(

The performance of the manager, i.e. T , will be

To equally emphasize the performance of workers and manager, we choose Bellman-Zadeh’s 
criterion [5], which maximizes the minimum of all membership functions corresponding to that
solution, i.e.,

where ijkx is an element of a feasible solution x of (1.1). Hence we construct the fuzzy A3AP

By membership functions of (1.2) and (1.4), we can further represent (1.5) as the

3. The Solution Procedure
Since Xλ is the maximum value of (2.1) by giving a feasible solution x of (1.1), the
maximum Xλ must be the optimal solution of (1.6). We restate (1.6) as following:

A branch and bound algorithm will be proposed for solving model (3.1)~(3.3). Part of the tree
of the solving procedure, if we let n = 3, is sketched as Figure 3. The algorithm proceed on
nodes from up to down, and left to right, until all the nodes are checked or eliminated by a
fathoming test. For each node ( i , j, k) resides at level i , there is a path leading to it from the
root node, which corresponds to a subset of the variables fixed to 1. At node (2, 1, 3) at level 2,
in Figure 3 for example, represents fixed variables 122x = 213x =1 and 1x = 2x =0 for other
nodes at level 1 and/or 2.
Consider first the following notations:
Let i = min ( 11i , 12i ,…, inn ) for iI,
i= min ( 11i , 12i ,…, inn ) for iI,

Step 4. Let p=1 and proceed down to node (1,1,1) from root node.
Step 5. Suppose we have reached to node (p, pj , pk ).
(1) If

toward the immediate right node of (p, pj , pk ) at level p. If node (p, pj , pk ) is the
last node of level p, go upward to the immediate right node of (p1, 1pj , 1pk ) at
level p1.
(2) If
ppkpj

level p+1 descend from (p, pj , pk ).

current optimal objective value. Move toward the immediate right node of
(p, pj , pk ) at level p. If node (p, pj , pk ) is the last node of level p, go upward to the
immediate right node of (p1, 1pj , 1pk ) at level p1.
Step 6. If we were at root node, then stop; otherwise, go to step 5.
4. Conclusion
This paper presents a fuzzy axial three-dimensional assignment problem and a
branch-and-bound algorithm in order to overcome uncertain environment in the real world
application. Further investigations include the costs are triangular, trapezoidal or other types of
membership functions.
