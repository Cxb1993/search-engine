1 INTRODUCTION 
Supported nano-gold particles can act as catalysts for reactions even at low temperatures. 
Haruta had reported that the highly active supported gold catalysts could be obtained by 
deposition-precipitation (DP) method, in which the preparation temperature usually need to be raised 
up to 70 or 80°C [1, 2] to enhance the catalytic activity. However, for commercial production in large 
scales, the temperature-control process not only is hard to achieve but also consumes large amount of 
energy. Hence, if the preparation process can be carried out at room temperature, the problem could 
be resolved. However, it was discovered that supported gold catalysts prepared at room temperature 
would contain residual chloride, which would poison the catalytic activity. Hence, one of the 
objectives of this study was to develop an effective process for removing residual chloride in 
Au/TiO2 prepared at room temperature, 
On the other hand, literature shows that supported gold, such as Au/TiO2, would be deactivated 
not only on-stream [3-7] but also during storage [1, 8-13], which might weaken the practical 
durability of the catalyst and make it difficult to compare the results of the catalysts with different 
storage time even from the same research group. Therefore, it is of great importance to determine 
the reasons for the deactivation of Au/TiO2. Although there have been many researches concerning 
the deactivation and storage effect of gold catalyst, the exact effect of different conditions are still 
unclear and remain in dispute. The other aim of this research is to determine the effect of light, 
container and vacuum on Au/TiO2 during storage and to find a best way to store Au/TiO2 catalyst. 
2 EXPERIMENT 
2.1 Catalyst preparation 
The Au/TiO2 catalysts were prepared by deposition-precipitation (DP) method. A suitable 
amount of chloroauric acid was dissolved in deionized water to attain the concentration of gold 
solution at 1.5×10
-3
 M. After stabilizing the temperature of gold solution at 30˚C, NaOH solution 
(0.1 N) was added to adjust the pH of the gold solution to pH 6. Then the solution was kept stirring 
for 6 hours to ensure the solution was stabilized. Afterward, TiO2 powder was added into the solution. 
Then, the solution was either maintained at 30˚C (for room-temperature process) or heated to 80˚C 
(for standard process) and maintained for 1 hour with constant stirring. After cooling to room 
temperature, the solid sample was collected by filtration, washed with deionized water and dried at 
60˚C in air for 6 hrs. For reduced Au/TiO2 catalysts, the reduction was carried by calcining the 
samples mentioned above in air at 200°C (3K min
-1
) for 2 hours. 
2.2 Catalytic reaction 
CO oxidation was used to evaluate the catalytic activity of Au/TiO2. The reaction was carried 
out in a packed bed tubular quartz reactor (7 mm i.d.) at 273K. About 20 mg Au/TiO2 (containing 
  
explains the poor catalytic activity of Au/TiO2@30C. In order to reduce the amount of chloride on 
Au/TiO2@30C, two post treatments processes for Au/TiO2@30C and a gold deposition process in the 
solution at higher pH values were investigated in this research. The influence from these processes 
on the catalytic property for CO oxidation and on metal and chloride loading on Au/TiO2@30C are 
reported in the followings. 
3.1.1 Hot water post-treatment 
The less amount of chloride on Au/TiO2 (prepared in 80℃ water) than on Au/TiO2@30C 
suggests that the breaking bond between Au and Cl on TiO2 surface and removing Cl into water may 
need 80℃ hot water. Therefore, the hot water treatment, in which the catalyst was  vigorously 
stirred in 80 ℃ water, was applied to attempt for improving the catalytic activity of Au/TiO2@30C. 
If the catalytic activity of Au/TiO2@30C can be improved to be as high as that of Au/TiO2, since 
only 10 ml of hot water is used for one gram of Au/TiO2@30C instead of 125 ml for producing one 
gram of Au/TiO2, the energy saving for producing Au/TiO2@30C with hot water is apparent. Figure 
1 shows CO oxidation activity over 80℃ water treatment on Au/TiO2@30C after drying (designated 
as Au/TiO2@30C-post80C). It can be found that CO conversion has been increased from ~25% (over 
Au/TiO2@30C) to more than 80% (over Au/TiO2@30C-post80C). The residual chloride has been 
decreased from 0.30 at% (on Au/TiO2@30C) to 0.13 at% (on Au/TiO2@30C-post80C), measured by 
using XPS, as shown in Table 1. This has demonstrated that 80 ℃ hot water treatment after drying 
is effective for decreasing chloride residual and for increasing the catalytic activity of 
Au/TiO2@30C. 
Nevertheless, after the treatment above, no water washing was carried out when filtration 
process was applied. It may be the reason for that still 0.13 at% residual chloride remain on 
Au/TiO2@30C-post80C. Hence, the procedure of washing was applied on Au/TiO2@30C-post80C. It 
was carried out with 500 ml de-ionized water during the filtration. Moreover, the effect from the 
temperature of washing water was examined. Therefore, 80˚C hot water and room temperature water 
were separately used for washing during the filtration process, and the resulting samples are 
designated as Au/TiO2@30C-post80Chw and Au/TiO2@30C-post80Cw respectively. Figure 1 
presents that the catalytic activities of Au/TiO2@30C-post80C can be improved further by applying 
both washing processes. The catalyst (Au/TiO2@30C-post80Cw) from washing by room temperature 
water possesses better catalytic activity than that (Au/TiO2@30C-post80Chw) from hot water 
washing. Its catalytic activity has been promoted almost as high as that of Au/TiO2 prepared from the 
standard deposition procedures in 80 ℃ water. As shown in Table 1, both washed samples exhibit 
undetectable residual chloride, according to XPS tests. It indicates that along with washing away 
chloride, a substantial amount of chloride on Au/TiO2@30C-post80C can be washed out by using 
cold and hot water. 
Another issue of the effect of hot water post-treatment is the timing for the process carried out. 
Haruta reported that the catalysts prepared by deposition-precipitation can be washed before drying 
  
loading become a serious disadvantage for the Au/TiO2 catalysts. It would not only enhance the cost 
of gold catalysts products, but also limit the application of the Au/TiO2 catalysts. 
3.1.3 Effect of gold solution pH value 
Another thinking was replacing Cl
-
 from gold complex in the procedure of adjusting gold 
solution pH value. As the preparation condition purposed by Haruta, the highly active support gold 
catalysts could be obtained by deposition-precipitation method with adjusting the gold solution pH 
value to 6 ~ 10 [12]. Figure 3 shows the relative concentration of gold complexes as a function of pH 
[16]. In generally, the [AuCl4]
- 
would be transfer to [AuClx(OH)4-x]
- 
with the increasing of gold 
solution pH value. For instant, while the gold solution was adjusted to pH 6, the average replacing 
ratio of gold complex was 3.2 ([AuCl0.8(OH)3.2]
-
). While the gold solution was adjusted to pH 9, all 
of the Cl- would be replaced ([Au(OH)4]
-
). Hence, with the increasing gold solution pH value, more 
Cl
- 
would be replaced. Table 3 lists the effect of gold solution pH value on both CO conversion and 
Au loading of the Au/TiO2 catalysts prepared by room temperature procedure. Sample #1 ~ #3 were 
all adjusted the gold solution pH value to 6. However, the real final pH values were different, and 
sample #4 and #5 were adjusted the gold solution pH value higher than 6. As one can seen, with 
increasing final gold solution pH value, the catalytic activity increased. While the gold solution was 
adjusted to pH higher than 6.5 (sample #4 and #5), the catalytic activities was as high as Au/TiO2 
catalysts prepared by standard procedure. However, it was also found that while the gold solution pH 
value was increased, the gold loading decreased. As shown in Figure 4, it was easier to find that the 
gold loading was decreased linearly to the increased gold solution pH value. Meanwhile, CO 
conversion was not increased continuously after adjust to pH value higher than 6.5. However, for the 
same reason of NaOH(aq) treatment, increasing the gold solution pH value was not suitable for 
improving the performance of the Au/TiO2 catalysts prepared by room temperature procedure due to 
the decreasing of gold loading.  
3.2 Effect of storage conditions (light, container and vacuum) on Au/TiO2 catalyst 
The Au/TiO2 catalysts in the section were all prepared by standard process as described in 2.1 
and stored in various conditions as described in 2.4 to investigate the effect of storage conditions 
(light, container and vacuum) on Au/TiO2. 
3.2.1 Effect of light 
Figure 5 shows the CO oxidation activity at 0°C of Au/TiO2 stored in glass vial under different 
conditions. As can be observed, the activity of the catalyst exposed to light was lower than the one in 
the dark, whether in atmosphere or under vacuum. It indicates that light deactivates Au/TiO2 during 
storage. On the other hand, the gold titanium stored in the dark in the atmosphere showed high 
stability and still maintained 100% conversion even after 2 years of storage. 
The HR-TEM images of Au/TiO2 stored in glass vial with and without light exposure are shown 
in Figure 11 and Figure 12. The particle size of light-isolated Au/TiO2 didn‟t grow significantly after 
9 months; however, it possibly even decreased to lower than 1 nm, which is too small to be observed, 
  
method for enhancing the catalytic activity of Au/TiO2 catalysts prepared at room temperature. 
Moreover, 80°C water treatment was only effective while it was carried out after drying, in contrast 
to NaOH(aq) post-treatment, which would be only effective before drying. 
4.2 Effect of storage conditions (light, container and vacuum) on Au/TiO2 catalyst 
Light might cause agglomeration and thus decay the catalytic activity of Au/TiO2, while the 
samples stored in the dark maintained high activity and had higher gold dispersion after two years of 
storage. In addition, the activity of Au/TiO2 was also influenced by the material of the container. 
HDPE bottles and PE bags both caused deactivation of catalyst and reduction of gold, and the 
influence of the latter was far more significant than that of the former. It is highly possible that the 
deactivation was due to gold agglomeration, and for PE bags some organic compound coated on the 
surface of catalyst was observed, suggesting PE bags might have interaction with Au/TiO2 catalysts. 
Moreover, the catalytic activity of Au/TiO2 stored under vacuum decayed substantially, regardless of 
the variations of light and container. Stronger interaction between gold and titanium might be the 
main reason for the deactivation caused by vacuum. Consequently, light, containers composed of 
organic materials and vacuum must be avoided during the storage of gold catalyst. The most 
effective way to store Au/TiO2 catalysts suggested herein is to store Au/TiO2 catalysts in atmosphere 
in the dark at room temperature, and in containers which would not interact with Au/TiO2 such as 
glass vials, and under those the catalyst can maintain high activity for at least 2 years.
