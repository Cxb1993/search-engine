Aptamers were basically screen derived in the 1990s from the systematic evolution of ligands by the 
exponential enrichment during the so-called SELEX process [43-45]. Aptamers are able to bind to target 
molecules including amino acids, proteins, drugs, organic or inorganic molecules, or optical isomers with 
specificity and high affinity [46, 47]. As a type of oligonucleotide, aptamers are easy to synthesize and modify 
on a large scale with functional groups or nanoparticles [26, 32, 48, 49]. Aptamers have many applications, 
including separation, therapeutics, clinical diagnostics, and particularly in biosensing.  
A GMR device is an optical filter that utilizes a grating on the top of a planar waveguide to reflect a 
specific wavelength of transmitted light [50]. This device produces a narrow resonance dip (a few nanometers 
wide) in the transmission spectrum. GMR sensors detect biomolecules and interactions between biomolecules 
by evanescent waves on the chip surface. The filtered wavelength shifts when the optical path length changes 
in the region of the evanescent waves. A GMR sensor offers the advantages of high-sensitivity [51], label-free, 
real-time detection, and high throughput [52]. 
Two aptamers have been developed for targeting thrombin in different sites with high affinity and 
specificity. These aptamers are 15 and 29 base oligonucleotides. The binding equilibrium constants (Kd) were 
reported to be 26 nM and 0.5 nM, respectively [53, 54]. This binding is similar to the binding of antibodies to 
their antigens. When thrombin binds to its aptamer ligand, the thrombin aptamer (TBA) plays the role of 
inhibitor, restricting the activity of the thrombin [55]. Studying the interaction between thrombin and its 
aptamer has great potential for clinical applications.
II. Objective 
In this study, first, we propose a modified model for systematically predicting the sensitivity of a series 
of GMR structures. The model provides a more convenient and quicker performance evaluation of GMR 
sensitivity in biosensing. There is a fair agreement between the results respectively obtained with the 
proposed model and the RCWA method. The relation between the sensitivity and the structure is discussed 
and a device with a sensitivity 4.5 times that of the traditional GMR biosensor is also proposed. Second, this 
work also aims on the combination of a GMR device and an aptamer for developing a new aptasensor. The 
investigation includes GMR surface modification, 29-mer TBA immobilization and kinetics studies between 
29-mer TBA with thrombin. The proposed device achieves real-time and label-free detection of thrombin. The 
results are discussed in relation to detection sensitivity and the kinetic behavior of the thrombin binding with 
the aptamer.
III. Methods 
Principles of GMR and the Modified Model 
The GMR device is an optical filter which reflects the resonance wavelength, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The 
GMR device generally has three layers: a substrate, a waveguide layer and a grating layer with a high spatial 
frequency (sub-wavelength period). Consider a light wave propagates into the top of the GMR device. Under 
normally incidence conditions, the higher order diffracted light is all evanescent given the choice of an 
appropriate grating period, i.e., >>/neff (: the grating period; neff: the effective reflective index of the 
waveguide). Resonance occurs when the diffracted waves are phase-matched with the waveguide modes. That

diffraction angle from grating. Assume that the light impinges on the GMR normally. Now, the modified 
waveguide equation for wavelength shifting behavior can be expressed as 
 cot( ) , 0,1, 2, ...; 0,1, 2, ...g g top bottom gk m h m m m        , (3) 
where kg=(2/). Eq. (3) can be solved to obtain the propagation angle (constant) when the geometric 
structure and the refractive indices around the waveguide are given. Once the propagation angle is solved, the 
resonance wavelength can be solved using Eq. (2) as well. The performance (sensitivity) of a GMR sensor can 
be calculated by adding an increase of reflective index in the top layer. Through Eq. (3) and Eq. (2), the 
resonance wavelength difference (sensitivity) can be solved. 
Reagents 
The oligonucleotides were synthesized by MDBio Inc., Taiwan. The TBAs were modified with NH2 at 
the 5’ end and purified with HPLC. The sequence was 5’NH2-AGT CCG TGG TAG GGC AGG TTG GGG 
TGA CT-3’ [54]. Thrombin from human plasma was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), 
along with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), and glutaraldehyde (GA). Salt 
for the buffer solutions, sodium phosphate monobasic, and sodium phosphate dibasic were obtained from 
Fluka. All reagents were standard grade. 
GMR Device Fabrication and Aptamer Immobilization 
Fig. 2(A) depicts the geometry of the GMR sensor, which has a 620 μm thick fused silica substrate, a 
waveguide and a grating layer, both made of Si3N4. A SiO2 layer for surface modification was deposited on 
top of the grating by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD, Unaxis/Nextral D200). The 
fabrication process began with a standard cleaning of the substrate using (1) acetone and (2) isopropyl alcohol, 
followed by (3) rinsing with deionized (DI) water. Each step took place in an ultrasonic cleaner for 3 min, 
followed by drying under a stream of pure nitrogen. After cleaning, a 180 nm layer of Si3N4 film was 
deposited by PECVD. Once the deposition was completed, a positive photoresist layer was spun onto the 
Si3N4. A one-dimensional grating for which the period is 950 nm and the filling factor is 0.5, was layered with 
an e-beam writer (Raith 150, Japan). After lithography, the photoresist was developed. The chip was etched 
using a high-density plasma etcher (HDP, Unaxis/Nextral 860L), and finally the residual photoresist was 
removed using standard cleaning procedures. The chip size is shown in Fig. 2(B). The chip is 1 × 1 cm

 and 
the structured area is located at the center with size of 1.5 × 1.5 mm

. The detection area (structure area) is 
totally covered with the fluidic channel.

to 1.5 μM. The thrombin, pure tris-HCl buffer, and 2 M NaCl solutions were stored at 35 °C for 1 h before the 
experiment. The dimensions of the fluidic cell were 10 mm × 5 mm × 0.1 mm. A peristaltic pump moved the 
solution into the fluidic cell at a constant rate of 50 μL/min. However, due to limitations of the detection 
system setup, the tris-HCl buffer was pumped into the fluidic cell for 5 min for baseline measurement. The 
binding association rate constant was determined by pumping the thrombin/tris-HCl solution into the fluidic 
cell with the GMR chip modified by the TBA. Once the shifts of wavelength had stabilized, the tris-HCl 
buffer was again pumped for the disassociation process to removing the non-specifically bound thrombin, 
following by a regeneration step with the 2 M NaCl solution. These steps above were repeated with different 
concentrations of thrombin. 
In Situ Binding Kinetic Measurements 
This study adopted a simple Langmuir one-to-one adsorption isotherm for the kinetic analysis. The 
interactions of thrombin and TBA (A and B) are formulated as in eq. (4), and follow the rate equation given 
by eq. (5):

where the terms ka and kd represent the binding association and dissociation rate constants. The signal from the 
biosensor (R) is proportional to the concentration of complex (AB), and the maximum signal (Rmax) is 
proportional to the initial concentration of (B) and is used for binding isotherm data. This means that eq. (5) can 
be rewritten as: 
RkAkRAkdtdR daa )][(][/ max   (6)  
Since the concentration of thrombin (A) vanishes due to the washing out of nonspecific binding in the 
dissociation phase. The rate constant kd can be determined from eq. (6), and the dissociation (washing) step

Then, with the kd value obtained from eq. (7), the ka value can be derived or fitted for the sensorgram as:

Differentiate Eq. (3) with  but replace the  in terms of , as shown in Eq. (10): 
 2 / (2 cos( ))total wgd d n h     , (10) 
where d means the resonance shift; and dtotal stands for dtopl+dbottoml. Eq. (10) indicates the wavelength 
shifts are proportional to the square of the resonance wavelength and inversely proportion to the waveguide 
thickness. Since the grating period is positively proportion to the wavelength (Eq. (2)), Eq. (10) also indicates 
that the wavelength shifts are also positively proportion to the grating periods which has a good agreement 
with Fig. 3. It can be seen that the wavelength shifts both in TE and TM modes decay with waveguide 
thickness. Fig. 3 also shows a positive relation between the shifts and the resonance wavelengths as well as 
the grating periods. In a GMR (or photonic crystal) biosensor, the overlap of the evanescent waves and the 
analytes contribute to the sensitivity. Larger overlap leads to a greater sensitivity [12, 13]. The extending 
length of the evanescent wave is related to the confinement of the waveguide. The length of the evanescent 
tail outside the waveguide is shorter with a greater confinement. Thus, both Fig. 3 (a) and (b) indicate poor 
sensitivity with large waveguide thickness. On the other hand, Eq. (10) shows that the shifts are also related to 
the propagation angle in the waveguide. According to the diffraction grating equation (Eq. (2)), the 
propagation angle for a normally incident light source can be expressed as sin
-1
[/(nwg )]. The propagation 
angles are strongly related to the grating period, the incident wavelength and the incident angle. However, 
compare with the angle of propagation, the thickness of the waveguide dominant the sensitivity except near 
the cutoff region. Therefore, a slowly decay in sensitivity with waveguide thickness (Fig. 3) is shown in the 
thick waveguide region. 
 
Fig. 4. Total phase shift curve for a slab waveguide and the structure relation curve. The right figure gives a 
partial zoom in on the left figure. The reflective index increase on the top layer is set to 0.1 for better display 
Even though the waveguide thickness is inversely related to the sensitivity, there is still a sharp increase 
in the sensitivity as the geometric parameters are close to cutoff condition. This phenomenon can be attributed 
11 
 
the TE and TM modes there is a positive shift in the resonance wavelength when the relative grating depths 
were increased. The gratings can be regard as a perturbation of the refractive index in the top layer and also 
considered as a high effective refractive index layer on the waveguide. A deep grating increases the thickness 
of the effective layer that causes a shift in the resonance wavelength to longer wavelengths, as shown in Fig. 5. 
Therefore, the resonance wavelength is increased. From Fig. 5 it can be seen that the most sensitive GMR 
structure calculated with the modified model shows the largest shifts, while, there are relatively small shifts in 
the resonance wavelength in the region far from cutoff in the GMR structure caused by the depth of the 
grating. 
 
Fig. 5. Shifts in the resonance wavelength shifts with the different grating depths for: (a) TE mode; and (b) 
TM mode. All the structures were resonant at 1.55μm under a thin grating condition (0.1). Both the axes are 
normalized with the resonance wavelength (1.55m). The waveguide thickness/period values simulated here 
for case1 (near cutoff) are 0.07/1.07 (TE), 0.14/1.07 (TM), case2 (high sensitivity) are 0.12/1.04 (TE), 
0.26/1.03 (TM) and case3 (far from cutoff) are 0.7/0.82 (TE), 0.7/0.84 (TM). 
In short, the modified model gives an accurate solution of the resonance wavelength in ideal cases. In far 
from cutoff cases, the difference is smaller than 0.5%. Fig. 5 clearly shows the grating depth affecting the 
accuracy of the simplified model. The difference between the model and the RCWA method is higher for the 
high sensitivity condition than others. However, in this case, the differences are all lower than 4% for a 
grating under 0.1 normalized depths. 
The relation of the grating depth to the sensitivity is shown in the Fig. 6. Fig. 6 shows the sensitivity of 
the GMR sensor with different grating depths: 5nm, 70nm and 150nm, and the sensitivity values calculated 
from the modified model. The x-axis is the waveguide thickness and the y-axis is the bulk sensitivity. The 
sensitivity of the GMR sensor predicted by the proposed model is almost the same as that simulated by 
RCWA for a waveguide thickness of h> 0.2μm. When the waveguide thickness h< 0.2μm, the proposed model 
underestimates the sensitivity. The thicker the grating is, the greater the underestimation, especially when the 
waveguide thickness is close to the cutoff thickness. This phenomenon can be attributed to the structure, the 
ultra thin waveguide and the grating depth not being shallow enough. At this time, the depth of the grating 
cannot be ignored. This kind of structure pulls the electric magnetic energy distribution to the grating layer 
and makes for more overlap between the analytes and the evanescent wave. Thus, relatively large error is 
shown for the thin waveguide conditions. However, in the thin grating case there is good agreement between

Fig. 7. The transmission spectrum for the GMR chips (black) and the RCWA simulation (red) in an air 
environment. The resonance wavelength was 1,417.5 nm. The simulation parameters were in accordance with 
the AFM morphology results for the GMR chip. The side band ripples were the result of interference from the 
substrate. 
Each step of the surface modifications and aptamer immobilization showed different exposed functional 
groups on the surface of the chip. The WCA was measured to evaluate the wettability between each step of 
surface modifications. These measurements qualitatively indicated the progress and success of the surface 
modification. Table 1 shows that the unmodified bare fused silica surface exhibited high hydrophilicity, with a 
WCA of 20.5°. After SAM modification of the silica surface, as described in Section 2.3, the WCA increased 
to 51.7°. This large variation indicated that the NH2 group of SAM had made the surface more hydrophobic. 
These results agreed with previous reports on the silanization of glass slides [56]. The WCA decreased to 
28.1° when the aptamer was successfully immobilized on SAM.

The immobilization of the aptamer was also verified by ESCA. The aptamer was an oligonucleotide of 
DNA, and the bonding energy of the DNA backbone phosphorus atom at 2p orbits (P 2p) was approximately 
133.7 eV [57]. Neither the bare substrate, nor the SAM molecules have P 2p peaks. The ESCA results are 
shown in Fig. 8 and the peak at 133.8 eV demonstrates that the aptamer was covalently immobilized.

There were four steps in the detection process: first, pure tris-HCl buffer solution (baseline); second, buffer 
solution with thrombin (association); third, pure buffer again (dissociation); fourth, 2 M NaCl solution 
(regeneration). The four steps were repeated with different thrombin concentrations (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, and 1.5 
μM). (B) The resonance wavelength responses (shifts) of the GMR sensor to different concentrations of

 is 0.8 and the sensitivity is calculated to be 0.04 nm/μM. 
Real Time Binding Kinetics 
This study also determined the binding kinetic constants by analyzing the real-time sensorgram with the 
Langmuir adsorption assumption. The sensorgram used purely represents the binding/adsorption 
concentration of the analytes. The Langmuir isotherm model was adapted is basically for its one-to-one 
binding simplicity. Also, discussion based on the obtained ka and kd for possible analysis of specific and 
non-specific binding is possible. As discussed above, the wavelength shifts are attributable to increased 
materials on the chip surface. In this study, wavelength shifts represent the formation of the aptamer-thrombin 
complex. Table 2 lists the constants. The association rate constants (ka) where shown to be on the order of 10

. On the other hand, the Ka of the thrombin concentrations from 0.25 to 1 μM as 
calculated by the Langmuir linear regression is also gives a value on the order of 10

which is the same 
order of fitting as from the real time sensorgram. The individual values of ka and kd may be affected by the 
diffusion, but the Ka value is a thermodynamic data result, no diffusion effect is involved. However, high 
values of the disassociation constant, kd, indicating high nonspecific binding between the immobilized 
aptamer and the surface with thrombin, are clearly present. This is why the Ka value in this report is lower 
than the value documented for other non-labeling sensors. The affinity constant for thrombin and its 29-mer 
TBA ranged from 10
7
 to 10
9
 according to different detection methods, such as quartz crystal microbalance 
(QCM), SELEX and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) [53, 54]. Based on these results and the 
different detection methods used, with more defined surface chemistry and the improvements of reducing 
non-specific binding by the incorporation of anti-fouling materials, such as PEG or SBMA, the preliminary 
data presented by this first GMR measurement of aptasensor, suggest it is an applicable method for the kinetic 
analysis of biomolecular interactions.

技術說明 
（中文） 
傳統的波導共振生物感測器利用入射光於元件內產生波導共振，
而共振波長的位移量可用以偵測生物分子之交互作用。但由於傳
統感測器在相位移圖上會產生兩個內全反射角，因此若要產生內
全反射則必須提升繞射角度，如此便會導致共振波長之位移量大
幅減少，而偵測生物分子之高靈敏度區域變小。 
此新型波導共振生物感測器為提升感測靈敏度，本研究於波導共
振元件與基板之間增加一層金屬緩衝層，利用金屬產生全反射的
概念，使入射光進入金屬層時不需考慮臨界角度即可產生內全反
射。這樣的改良可消除第二個內全反射角以提升共振波長位移
量，並且使金屬層提供額外的內全反射相位補償，使相位補償轉
移至感測器的表面，進而提升生物感測之靈敏度。 
新型波導共振生物感測器具有較傳統型元件更高且寬廣的靈敏度
區，此改良除了可提供醫學上偵測新型生物分子及病毒之方便性
外，還可延伸出更精確完善的生物檢驗系統。（200-500字）

The classical guided mode resonance (GMR) biosensor using 
the grating to diffract the incident light and resonant the 
diffract light into the waveguide. Moniting the shifts of 
resonance wavelength can detect the biomolecular 
interaction. However, the classical GMR sensor has two total 
internal reflection angle on the phaase diagram, thus 
decrease the sensitivity of GMR sensor.  
For improve the sensitivity, this novel GMR sensor adds a 
metal film between the GMR sensor and the substrate, so that 
there elimilate one total internal reflection and increase 
the sensitivity.

此計畫目標為建立波導共振元件結合核適體之生物感測器。在此執行此計畫兩年中，自數
值最佳化模擬到系統建構與最後的實驗量測皆獲得完整之結果，其中波導共振元件與核適體

前亦有一篇模擬文章正在審核當中。 
3. 請依學術成就、技術創新、社會影響等方面，評估研究成果之學術或應用價
值（簡要敘述成果所代表之意義、價值、影響或進一步發展之可能性）（以

1. 本研究達到之成果為以下：a. 最佳化表面淺蝕刻之波導共振元件之最佳化之數值模
擬，b. 成功結合核適體與波導共振元件並應用於凝血酶之檢測。 
根據文獻探討，目前學術界雖有針對特殊參數做優化的波導共振元件，不過並未有全面針
對波導共振元件與將其應用於生物感測器之敏感度的分析。而本研究成果 a 中所達到的
成果即為對波導共振元件以基礎理論分析其元件所產生之共振波與生物分子之交互作
用，並發展一套特殊之數值運算方法，能夠在極短的時間內掃瞄多組波導共振元件結構參
數與其對應之敏感度。此演算法相對於現有之光學模擬軟體，擁有更短的計算時間。 
而成果 b 則是展示了一個具有低檢測成本的生物感測系統，且至目前文獻亦未有發現有
相同的核適體式波導共振生物感測器。此結合可望能提供相對於以往免疫檢測系統更低的
配體製備成本、可調之配體與檢測物之結合能力與可設計對應不同檢測物之感測晶片。 
2. 在數值優化模擬之中，其計算之模型為一新型之模型，能提供快速與準確波導共振元
件與其對應敏感度之數值。雖然此模型推導過程中有一簡化之假設，但是與現有光學模擬
軟體的比較誤差在 4%以內。目前此模型僅供表面淺蝕刻之波導共振生物感測器計算敏感度
之用，但此模擬模型亦有機會可改寫，使其他類型波導共振生物感測器也可適用。 
在核適體波導共振感測器之量測系統部分，則是根據本實驗是既有之量測技術加以改進而
