2Wf is the final percentage increase in weight of the tested
samples.
Biodegradation studies
Samples were cast into films using a 50×50mm plastic mold.
The films were then washed several times with a large amount of
distilled water until the rinsed water was neutral. Afterwards, the
film was placed on a piece of glass with the film edges clamped,
and then dried in a vacuum oven (502℃, 0.5mmHg, 24h). The
resulting films were 0.050.02mm thick.
Films were then placed in compost petri dishes containing
30 mL phosphate buffer (100 mM; pH 6.3) with p-cresol (1.8
mM) and tyrosinase (20U/mL), incubated at 352℃ and 505%
relative humidity. After reaction, the films were washed
extensively with deionized water and then dried. In this work,
the studies were conducted using three replicate test reactors and
three replicate samples in each test reactor for each exposure
time, meaning that each result was based on nine samples.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Grafting of AA onto PCL was investigated via FTIR. Figs.
1(A) and 1(B) show the FTIR spectra of PCL and PCL-g-AA. In
addition to the characteristic peaks of both polymers (3300-3700,
1725, 852-1480 and 720 cm-1)6, there exists an obvious extra
peak at 1710 cm-1 for the modified PCL. Furthermore, the FTIR
spectra of PCL/chitosan(10wt%) (Fig. 2[A]) and
PCL-g-AA/chitosan(10wt%) (Fig. 2[B]) produced peaks
between 3200 and 3700cm1, which were much more intense
than the stretching absorbance at 3000-3600cm1 observed in the
absence of chitosan (Fig. 1). The spectra of
PCL-g-AA/chitosan(10wt%) also had unique absorption peaks at
1717 and 1745cm1. The peak at 1717cm1 is assigned to C=O
of N(COR)2 while the peaks at 1745cm
1 are due to absorption
ofC=O in OCOR. These ester and imide functional groups are
formed via the reaction between OH of PCL-g-AA and–NH of
chitosan when the two polymers are blended. Additionally, the
spectra in Fig. 2 identify differences in absorbance intensity at
1650cm1 (amide I, secondary amide) and 1590cm1
(nonacylated primary amide).
To further confirm the grafting of AA, the structure of
PCL and PCL-g AA was compared using 13C NMR. Figs. 3(A)
and 3(B) show the 13C NMR spectra of PCL and PCL-g-AA,
respectively. There are six carbon peaks for unmodified PCL (1:
=64.21ppm; 2:=28.88ppm; 3:=25.93ppm; 4:=25.01ppm; 5:
=34.26ppm; 6: =173.11ppm). Kesel et al.7 reported a similar
outcome in their study of a polycaprolactone polyvinylalcohol
composite. The spectrum of PCL-g-AA shows some extra peaks
(7: C=35.63ppm; 8: C=42.19ppm; 9:C=O=175.05ppm),
the existence of which confirms that AA had been grafted onto
PCL.
The solid-state 13C NMR spectra of original chitosan,
PCL/chitosan(10wt%), and PCL-g-AA/chitosan(10wt%) are
shown in Fig. 4(A-C). The spectrum of original chitosan is the
same as that reported by Zong et al.8. Moreover, Fig. 4(C) also
coincides with the 13C NMR results of acylated chitosan
characterized by Zong et al.25. Comparing signals between the
spectra of PCL/chitosan(10wt%) and
PCL-g-AA/chitosan(10wt%), we found that there were extra
peaks at =42.19ppm (C) and =35.63ppm (C) in the latter.
These peaks were also observed in our previous report2 on the
13C NMR of POE-g-AA/chitosan. As already indicated, the
appearance of peaks at Cand C in PCL-g-AA is due to
grafting of AA onto PCL. However, the peak at =175.05ppm
(C=O) (shown in Fig. 3[B]), also characterizing the grafting of
AA onto PCL, is absent in the solid state spectrum of
PCL-g-AA/chitosan(10wt%) (Fig. 4[C]). The reaction
between–COOH of AA and–OH or–NH of chitosan shifted the
peak at =175.05ppm to the duplicates at b, c, d, e and f
(=178.7,177.1,172.6,170.8 and 168.9ppm), evidence of the
condensation between PCL-g-AA and chitosan. Via this
condensation reaction, the original chitosan was fully acylated
and the amino and amide groups were converted to imides
(represented by peaks d, e and f in Fig. 4[C]). This reaction does
not occur between PCL and chitosan, illustrated by the absence
of corresponding peaks in the PCL/chitosan(10wt%) spectrum
(Fig. 4[B]). Formation of imide and ester functional groups
noticeably affected the thermal, mechanical and biodegradation
properties of PCL-g-AA/chitosan, which will be illustrated in the
following sections.
PCL-g-AA/chitosan blends exhibited moderately good
water resistance and resistance was higher than that of
PCL/chitosan blends at the same chitosan content, as can be seen
in Fig. 5. The increment of water absorption for PCL/chitosan
was about 2~8%. For both blends, the percentage water gain
increased with chitosan content. Bikiaris and Panayiotou9 also
noted increases in water absorption with chitosan content in their
study of chitosan-polyethylene blends. They deduced that the
marked increase in water absorption was probably caused by the
increased difficulty in forming polymer chain arrangements as
the chitosan prohibited the movements of the polymer segments,
and also that the hydrophilic character of chitosan led to poor
adhesion with the hydrophobic polyethylene (a steric effect). In
this study, the difficulty in forming polymer chain arrangements
and the steric effect of PCL-g-AA/chitosan was caused by the
ester carbonyl and amide functional group on that blend.
Biodegradation
Exposure to enzymatic environment
Figure 6 shows that the changes in weight ratio (degraded
sample/initial sample) with time for PCL/chitosan and
PCL-g-AA/chitosan exposed to incubated tyrosinase followed a
similar pattern to the weight loss on exposure to a soil
environment. The extent of biodegradation is dependent on the
morphology of the polymer blends. In the PCL/chitosan blends,
the major component (PCL) forms the matrix and the minor
component (chitosan) is the dispersed phase. SEM
microphotographs, taken after 2 and 8 weeks exposure to
incubated tyrosinase, show the morphology of the
PCL/chitosan(10wt%) and PCL-g-AA/chitosan(10wt%) blends,
and the changes that had taken place (Fig. 7). There were bigger
and deeper holes/pits in PCL/chitosan (Fig. 7[A]), which were
also more random in distribution than those in the
PCL-g-AA/chitosan blend (Fig. 7[B]). Morphological analysis
also showed that biodegradation of the chitosan phase of
PCL/chitosan blends increased with time, confirming the results
presented in Fig. 6.
Unlike the PCL matrix, there was fine dispersion and
homogeneity of chitosan in the PCL-g-AA matrix (Fig. 7 [D]).
Moreover, the extent of phase biodegradation was less than 20%
in all compatibilized blends and was detectable only at higher
magnifications. This better dispersion arises from the formation
of branched and crosslinked macromolecules created from
hydroxyls (of chitosan) reacting with free acid groups (of
PCL-g-AA). These macromolecules contain two different parts,
one of which is compatible with PCL-g-AA and one with
chitosan, giving them the ability to place themselves in the
interface of PCL-g-AA/chitosan during melt blending. The result
is a reduction in the interfacial tension between the two
polymers and a finer distribution of chitosan in all the
compatibilized blends. In a paper on the compatibility of starch
particles in LDPE/starch blends, Bikiaris10 proposed a similar
explanation for low biodegradation of compatibilized blends
under tensile disruption (PE-g-MAH as a compatibilizer).
