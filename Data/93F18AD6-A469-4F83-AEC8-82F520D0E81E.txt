Abstract
Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are chemically stable and have been an important
class of fire retardant since the 1970s. PBDEs are typically added directly to fabrics or plastics to
increase its durability under high heat; however, since there is no chemical binding with the
underlying material, PBDE may leach out of the final product during its usage or when disposed
of improperly, thus causing pollution in the ambient environment. Further, as PBDEs-containing
products are often used in offices, cars, homes and other indoor environment where people are
likely to come in direct contact, direct exposure to PBDEs appeared likely in the general
population. BDE-209 is the most stable compound in all PBDE congeners as was most used
among commercially produced PBDEs; however, in past studies relatively little information was
available for BDE-209 due to difficulties in analytical procedures.
In this study, we analyzed BDE-209 with high-performance liquid chromatography equipped
with an ultraviolet detector (HPLC/UV). Indoor dust samples were collected to estimate levels of
BDE-209 from local homes, offices, research laboratories and automobiles. The samples were
collected with a vacuum cleaner, dried and screen-sieved before taken to microwave extraction
with HPLC-grad acetone. Instrumental settings included the use of Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18
column (4.6×150 mm, 3.5 μm), 100% HPLC-grade methanol as the mobile phase at 1 ml/min, a
sample injection volume of 10μl via autosampler, and a sample analysis time of 12 minutes, and
Korea, but not a lot from Taiwan. Hence, the purpose of this study is to examine indoor levels of
BDE-209 in the indoor environment in southern Taiwan.
Materials and Methods
This study was performed in Kaohsiung City, the largest metropolitan area in southern
Taiwan. Interior dust samples were collected from various homes, offices and private cars. Each
dust sample was collected from the floors using an electric vacuum cleaner with a thimble filter
fitted to the vacuum inlet. After sampling, the collected dust samples were kept in the thimble
filter and kept in a zipper bag. Before analysis, each sample was emptied from the filter and dried
in the oven at 105 C˚ until total weight stabilizes. The dried dust sample was then passed through
a 40-mesh sieve to remove excess debris. For chemical analysis, each pre-weighed dust sample
and extracted with 20 mL of HPLC-grade acetone using a microwave extraction device (CEM
MARS-5, CEM corporation, Matthews, North Carolina, USA). The extraction procedure
included heating to 120 C˚ in 15 minutes at 800 W, followed by a holding time of 10 minutes.
Afterwards, the cooled aliquot was filtered through a 0.45μm pore size PTFE filter.
The samples were analyzed with a high-performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a
DAD (Agilent Model 1200 HPLC/UV/DAD, Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA).
A C18 column (Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18, 4.6×150 mm, 3.5 μm) was used for analysis, and the
mobile phase was 100% methanol at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The sample injection volume was
10 l, and each sample run was set to 12 minutes. Instrumental calibration was performed over
0.6 –60 g/mL using the BDE-209 standard (purity >98%, Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St. Louis, MO,
USA), and the instrumental accuracy was measured with the purchased standard solution (50
mg/L, Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA). The UV detector was set at 290 nm for
detection and quantification of BDE-209. With the above instrumental settings, BDE-209 could
be detected at 8.9 minutes after sample injection, as shown in Figure 1. In some occasions when
BDE-209 concentrations were below the calibration range, then the extracts were concentrated
under nitrogen with an evaporation device (Tokyo Rikakikai Model MG-2200, Tokyo Rikakikai
Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The final solution volume was measured before instrumental analysis.

Results and Discussion
In all, 34 dust samples were collected, including 13 from cars, 7 from private homes, 4 from
offices, and 10 from research laboratories. The results are summarized in Table 1. As is shown in
the table, concentrations from different types of interior environment varied substantially, with
samples from homes, offices and laboratory approximately at the same magnitude level (several
thousand ng/g). in contrast, dust samples from cars showed substantially higher concentrations
both in terms of arithmetic and geometric mean concentrations. Only four dust samples were
collected from different offices, and three resulted in similar concentrations (2,000, 2,100 and
BDE-209Acetone
original data, studies with samples collected from different countries were separated for regional
comparisons. As can be seen in the figure, BDE-209 concentrations in the indoor dust ranged
widely among different studies, from below 10 to over 108 ng/g (i.e., over 10% in weight
concentration). Dust levels in cars appeared to be somewhat higher than at homes and workplaces,
but this difference was not consistent across studies. For example, in the study by Harrad et al.(16),
BDE-209 was not detected in any of the dust samples collected in New Zealand, as the country
phased out the compound years before study. Concentrations measured in Germany were
substantially lower than those collected in other countries. Among all studies, data reported from
U.S. and U.K. were consistently higher than other places. Among these study findings, results
from this study were on the mid- to low-end of range; however, the results from this study still
differed in average as well as range from those reported by Lai.(17) Although the sample size in
Lai's study was rather limited (five only), the results indicated that there may be some spatial or
temporal differences in the dust levels.

Summary and conclusion
In this study, we explored the possibility of using microwave extraction method and
HPLC/UV as an alternative method for analyzing ambient levels of BDE-209. The results
showed that BDE-209 is present and in abundant levels within the living environment. The levels
were somewhat comparable to those in the literature; however, as the sample size and study area
was somewhat limited in this study, more studies are desired to further confirm the environmental
distribution of BDE-209 in the indoor environment in Taiwan.

INTRODUCTION
Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been used as a flame retardant, and among the 209
possible congeners, the fully saturated decabrominated form has been most widely used.
Decabromodiphenyl ether (deca-BDE or BDE-209) is stable to heat, and releases bromine under
very high temperature that helps slow down the fire. Because of its massive use, deca-BDE has
caused widespread environmental pollution. Studies of PBDE contamination have been reported in
soil, sediment, sludge as well as biota. The reported data from human serum and adipose tissue with
elevated PBDE suggested that the compounds have somehow entered the human body. Various
studies have also reported high levels of deca-BDE in the environmental media such as sludge or
dust. On the other hand, other less-used congeners such as tetra-, penta- and hexabromodiphenyl
ethers have also been identified and in higher levels in the environment.
The analyses of BDE congeners have typically relied on sohxlet extraction followed by gas
chromatography and mass spectroscopy (GC/MS). Recent advancement of high-resolution gas
chromatography and mass spectroscopy (HRGC/HRMS) technology further lowered the detection
limit for various PBDEs, especially for the higher molecular weight congeners such as deca-BDE.
The sohxlet extraction requires large amount of solvent, takes a long time to process samples, and
tends to have low sample recovery rate. Recent development of microwave extraction technique has
the advantages of less solvent usage, faster sample treatment and better sample recovery, and its
application on sample pretreatment may be desirable. The GC/MS (as well as the HRGC/HRMS)
technique requires vaporization of sample analytes; however, deca-BDE does not vaporize well and
tends to degrade before reaching a boiling point. The characteristics of deca-BDE have caused
difficulties in quantifying deca-BDE, and it is unclear whether congeners detected under this
method may have resulted from the chemical breakdown of deca-BDE during the sample
vaporization process. In contrast, high-resolution liquid chromatograph (HPLC) analyzes chemical
under liquid state and would less likely to cause sample losses, but its application on the analyses of
deca-BDE has not been well developed.
In this study, we explore the use of microwave extraction method and high-resolution liquid
chromatography for the analyses of deca-BDE. In addition, the method was applied in measuring
ambient levels of deca-BDE in dust samples from various indoor environments.
MATERIAL AND METHOD
The analytical procedure was established for analyzing dust and sludge samples. Samples were
dried and screened for large particles, and approximately 2 g of each sample was extracted with 20
mL acetone in a microwave extraction device. The solution was heated to 120 ˚C and maintained 
for 50 minutes during the extraction process. After cooled down, the solution was filtered and was
ready for instrumental analysis.
The analytical procedure for deca-BDE with HPLC essentially followed the method described by
Riess and van Eldik1 with exception that a C18 column with smaller pore size was used (Eclipse
XDB-C18 column, 4.6×150 mm with 3.5 μm pore size), and that 100% methanol was used as the
mobile phase instead of 97% methanol with 3% buffered water. Standard deca-BDE (with 98%
purity) and externally prepared standard solution (50 mg/L, AccuStandard, New Haven, CT) was
purchased from the manufacturer for calibration and accuracy tests. Instrumental calibration was
performed regularly before sample measurements with prepared standard solutions at 0.4 to 60
mg/L. In addition, the method detection limit, limit of detection, limit of quantification, and sample
