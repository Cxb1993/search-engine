壹、添加有機質整治 Cr(VI)汙染土壤 
一、前言： 
鉻在環境中主要為Cr(VI)及Cr(III)兩種氧化態，土壤中六價鉻的毒性及移動性皆高於三價
鉻，因此若能將Cr(VI)轉變為毒性及移動性較低的Cr(III)，則能降低鉻對環境的毒害。 
近來多有研究利用添加有機質將土壤中六價鉻還原成三價鉻（Schindler etal., 1992; Losi 
et al., 1994; Bolan et al., 2003; Oliver et al., 2003），主要是利用有機質中溶解性有機碳等成分
作為電子供應者與土壤中六價鉻進行氧化還原反應： 
3CH2O (organic matter)＋2Cr2O72-＋16H＋→ 4Cr3＋＋3CO2＋11H2O 
根據此反應式，在 pH 值越低時有機質還原六價鉻之反應越快速，但是除了 pH 值的影響之
外，有機質與六價鉻之反應尚與有機碳的有效性、土壤微生物活性及土壤中之六價鉻濃度有
關 (Tokunaga et al., 2003)。 
Bolan 等人 (2003) 研究結果發現添加七種有機資材於六價鉻汙染土中，確實可以降低
土壤中可溶性及可交換性之六價鉻。因此本研究主要探討利用銅飽和選擇性離子交換樹脂抽
出法，作為評估添加兩種堆肥於六價鉻汙染土壤中降低土壤有效性六價鉻含量與植物毒害之
效應。 
二、材料與方法 
試驗採用三種台灣代表性土系（平鎮系、將軍系及太康系）之表土土壤，添加不同濃度
之 K2Cr2O7 溶液，使土壤中含有 0、175、250、400 和 500 mg Cr kg-1soil，經三次乾濕交替模
擬田間狀態後，再分別添加豬糞及牛糞堆肥於鉻汙染土中，使每公斤土壤增加 0、50、150 g
的有機質。利用銅飽和選擇性離子交換樹脂（DOWEX M4195）抽出土壤中有效的六價鉻，
探討土壤有效性六價鉻含量與有機質添加量、孵育時間之關係，並利用 X 光吸收近邊緣結構
光譜（X ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy, XANES）判別土壤中六價鉻在添加堆
肥前後之型態轉變。 
三、結果與討論： 
試驗結果已發表於 2006 年 Plant and Soil（SCI）期刊（詳附件：Lee, D. Y., Y. N. Shih, H. 
C. Zheng, C. P. Chen, K. W. Jung, J. F.2006. Using the selective ion exchange resin extraction and 
XANES methods to evaluate the effect of compost amendments on soil chromium(VI)

細胞壁中。根據 Sharma 等人 (1995) 之研究，Cr( )Ⅵ 會抑制小麥的代謝，造成其莖、葉出現
褐色斑點，葉尖捲曲分叉，根尖褐化壞死。鉻污染土壤對植物造成的毒害之鉻濃度，依植物
種類而異，一般在 30 ~ 500 mg kg-1 之間。作物植體中之鉻量則多在 4 ~ 100 mg kg-1 之間（Zayed 
et al., 2003）。 
在土壤中，由於 Cr(Ⅵ) 的移動性及有效性比 Cr(Ⅲ) 大，也更具植物毒性。由第壹部分
結果得知，添加有機堆肥能夠有效的將土壤中 Cr(VI)還原成毒性及移動性較低的 Cr(III)，因
此若能利用有機質的添加，使土壤中的鉻以 Cr(III)型態存在，則可藉由特定植物的栽種吸收
該土壤中 Cr(III)，以達到移除土壤鉻汙染之目的。 
故本試驗目的為評估不同種類之園藝植物對 Cr(III)的忍受度，以期篩選出鉻的超級吸收
累積植物。

參、結語及未來展望 
本研究第一部分利用選擇性離子交換樹脂抽出法證實添加堆肥約 20 天後，六價鉻汙染土
壤中有效性六價鉻含量隨著堆肥添加量的增加而顯著降低，而相同添加量的牛糞堆肥降低有
效性六價鉻之效果大於添加豬糞堆肥；經由 X 光吸收近邊緣結構光譜譜圖顯示，加入堆肥之
六價鉻汙染土壤 Cr(VI)/ Cr(III)比例較對照組土壤低，表示土壤中 Cr(VI)被還原成 Cr(III)，此

environment (Bartlett and James, 1988; Patterson
et al., 1997; Stewart et al., 2003). Since the toxic-
ity of Cr(VI) is greater than that of Cr(III), the
reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) could be a feasible
method to reduce Cr phytotoxicity in soils (Losi
et al., 1994; Stewart et al., 2003; Tokunaga et al.,
2003).
It is important to estimate the soil Cr(VI)
accurately in order to assess the Cr phytotoxic-
ity. The measurement of Cr(VI) bioavailability is
customarily accomplished by equilibrating the
soil with diluted HCl or KH2PO4 solution, fol-
lowed by colorimetric analysis for Cr(VI) with
diphenylcarbazide reagent (James and Bartlett,
1983; James et al., 1995; Risser and Baker, 1990).
The results obtained from these extraction meth-
ods, however, may not necessarily reﬂect the me-
tal uptake by plants, because the chemical
solutions could alter the soil conditions greatly.
Therefore, we propose using Cu-saturated selec-
tive ion exchange resin (DOWEX M4159), a re-
sin that has high aﬃnity for Cr(VI), to serve as
an inﬁnite sink to assess the bioavailability of
soil Cr(VI), especially since the resin extraction
method for soil metals is less destructive than the
chemical extraction method (Lee et al., 2005; Yu
et al., 2004). Our experimental results demon-
strated that there was a signiﬁcant negative cor-
relation between the resin-extractable Cr(VI) and
the height of wheat seedling growth. The experi-
mental results also suggested that the resin
extraction method was a better index for assess-
ing bioavailability of soil Cr(VI) when compared
with the chemical extraction method.
Although the DOWEX M4195 resin extrac-
tion method could be used to evaluate soil
Cr(VI) bioavailability, it could not directly sug-
gest the mechanism for Cr(VI) dissipation from
soils. For example, when equal amounts of
Cr(VI) was spiked into soils, less Cr(VI) could be
extracted from acidic soils than from alkaline
soils (Yu et al., 2004). By using the resin extrac-
tion method alone, however, it would be diﬃcult
to conclude whether the low Cr(VI) bioavailabil-
ity in acidic soil was due to the sorption of
Cr(VI) or of the reduction of Cr(VI). The X-ray
Absorption Near-Edge Structure (XANES) spec-
troscopy can provide information about the
structural environment of an atom. Since Cr(III)
has a stable orbit structure, its XANES spectrum
is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from that of Cr(VI). The
XANES spectra therefore could be a useful tool
to examine the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) in
soil samples (Bajt et al., 1993; Calas et al., 1984;
Szulczewski et al., 1997; Tokunaga et al., 2003).
Several researches have demonstrated that
adding organic reductants to soils could enhance
Cr(VI) reduction (Bajt et al., 1993; Bolan et al.,
2003; Higgins et al., 1998; Losi et al., 1994;
Tokunaga et al., 2003). In this study, the DOW-
EX M4195 resin extraction method was used to
study the eﬀect of two compost amendments on
the Cr(VI) bioavailability in three diﬀerent soils
spiked with various levels of Cr(VI). The XANES
spectra were used to elucidate the mechanisms for
Cr(VI) dissipation from soils amended with com-
posts. The amount of extractable Cr(VI) was cor-
related with wheat seedling growth in order to
evaluate the eﬀect of compost amendments on
decreasing the phytotoxicity of soil Cr(VI).
Materials and methods
Preparation of the resin
DOWEX M4195 resin (The Dow Chemical
Company, Midland, MI, USA) is one type of an-
ion exchanger (Zhao et al., 1998). Its chemical
composition and functional groups for binding
the anionic ligands were described in detail in
our previous study (Lee et al., 2005). The pur-
chased resin was ﬁrst immersed in deionized wa-
ter for 2 days and washed with 1 M HCl. After
the resin was air-dried, it was passed through a
40-mesh sieve and the particles remaining on the
sieve were selected for further treatment. The se-
lected resin was placed in glass columns and con-
verted into Cu(II)-saturated form by washing
with 500 mg L)1 CuCl2 solution at pH 4.5, until
the eﬄuent Cu(II) concentration equaled the
inﬂuent concentration. The Cu(II)-saturated resin
was then thoroughly rinsed and air-dried, and
retained in 60 mesh polypropylene (PP) bags.
Before the bags were used for retaining the resin,
they were immersed in 1 M HCl overnight and
then rinsed with distilled water and oven-dried.
A previous study showed that 1 g of the Cu-satu-
rated resin can adsorb over 6.37 mg Cr(VI) in a
solution, and that the amounts of Cr(VI)
extracted by the resins were not aﬀected by the
environment pH (Yu et al., 2004).

centrations in soil samples compared to those in
Cr standards. The normalized XANES spectra
were plotted using the software program of Ori-
gin Pro 7.0.
Growth of wheat seedlings on Cr(VI)-spiked soils
A modiﬁed Neubauer method (Lee, 1983) was
used to investigate the relationship between the
soil extractable Cr(VI) and the growth of wheat
seedlings. A series of plastic bottles (10 cm diam-
eter  7.5 cm high) were ﬁlled with 90 g of
Cr(VI)-spiked compost amended soils (including
control samples) that had gone through 60 days
of incubation, and was mixed with 50 g of acid-
washed quartz sand. Three milliliter of plant
nutrient solutions containing 0.18 M (NH4)2SO4,
0.088 M KNO3, 0.27 M MgSO4 and 0.087 M
KH2PO4 were put in each bottle, and suﬃcient
amount of distilled water was added to bring
each soil to ﬁeld capacity. The bottles were kept
at room temperature for 2 days to allow the
solution and solid mixture to reach equilibrium.
An additional 100 g of acid-washed quartz sand
was then added into each bottle to cover the so-
lid mixture surface. One hundred wheat seeds
(Triticum Vulgare, variety Taichung select No.
34) were placed evenly on the sand surface, and
another 50 g of quartz sand was then added to
cover the seeds and distilled water was supplied
as needed to maintain each soil at its ﬁeld capac-
ity. The wheat seedlings were grown in a glass
room with natural light, temperature controlled
day and night at 25 and 20 C, respectively, and
with relative humidity controlled at 70–95% in
the Phytotron of the National Taiwan Univer-
sity. The experiments were carried out in tripli-
cate for each type of soil with diﬀerent
treatments. The plant height (not including the
roots) of the wheat seedlings was measured
20 days after planting. To examine if there was
signiﬁcant diﬀerence between results of various
treatments, the Duncan’s multiple range test
(Duncan, 1955) was performed. To evaluate the
Cr(VI) phytotoxicity, the relationship between
plant heights and the resin-extractable Cr(VI) of
soils was examined. Plant heights grown in the
Cr(VI)-spiked soils relative to that in the control
treatment (without addition of Cr(VI) but with
the same compost amendment treatment) for
each tested soil were presented as a percentage of
control. A sigmoidal dose-response curve was
constructed to ﬁt the data of plant height (% of
control) and log-transformed soil resin-extract-
able Cr(VI) concentration using the program
package Sigma Plot. The eﬀective concentration
of resin-extractable Cr(VI) giving 10% growth
reduction (EC10) and 50% reduction (EC50) were
then estimated based on the sigmoidal curve
(Haanstra et al., 1985).
Results and discussion
The characteristics of soil and compost samples
The physical and chemical properties of the soil
and compost samples used in this study are sum-
marized in Table 1. Among the three soils stud-
ied, the Pc-soil had the lowest pH and highest
free iron oxides content. The Cf-soil contained
the lowest amounts of free iron oxides and or-
ganic matter content, while the Tk-soil had the
highest pH and organic matter content. The tex-
ture of Pc-soil and Tk-soil were classiﬁed as clay
soils, while the Cf-soil was classiﬁed as silty clay
loam (Gee and Bauder, 1986). For the two tested
composts, the CC sample had a lower C/N and
lower pH value than the HC sample.
Soil resin-extractable Cr(VI) as aﬀected
by compost amendments
Among the three soils tested at the same level of
Cr(VI) addition, the Cr(VI) extracted by the
selective resin followed the order of Pc-soil<Cf-
soil<Tk-soil (Table 2), which was also observed
in our previous studies (Lee et al., 2005; Yu
et al., 2004). The addition of composts into soils
signiﬁcantly (P<0.05) decreased the amounts of
extractable Cr(VI) (Table 2). It was observed
that less than 12 mg Cr(VI) kg)1 was extracted
from Cr(VI)-spiked soils amended with 5% CC
after 60 days of incubation. In Tk-soil, although
a signiﬁcant amount of Cr(VI) (142 mg kg)1)
could still be extracted from soil when amended
with 5% HC, the soil resin-extractable Cr(VI)
decreased to less than 12 mg kg)1 when the addi-
tion of HC increased to 15%. Comparing the
extractable Cr(VI) from Cf and Tk-soils with 5%
HC and 5% CC amendment, greater amounts of
Cr(VI) were extracted from soils amended with
90
5% HC. This observation seems to suggest that
CC amendment has a higher capacity to decrease
soil available Cr(VI) compared to HC. This is
probably due to the fact that CC had a lower
C/N ratio (29 of CC vs. 32 of HC), and thus
could be degraded more easily by the microor-
ganisms to enhance the Cr(VI) reduction.
Figure 1 shows an example of the eﬀect of
incubation time of compost amendments on the
resin-extractable Cr(VI) of the soil. The results
indicate that the amount of soil resin-extractable
Cr(VI) decreases as the incubation time increases
after compost amendment, suggesting that suﬃ-
cient time is needed for composts to react with
Cr(VI).
Cr XANES spectra of Cr(VI)-spiked soils
There was an intense peak at 5992–5994 eV in
the XANES spectra when various fractions of

5); (b) amended with 5% organic matter in the form of cattle-dung compost (CC 5). The error bars represented±1 standard devia-
tion.

On both XANES spectra of Pc-soil, with and
without compost amendment, there was no
detectable Cr(VI) peak (Figure 4), suggesting
that most Cr(VI) was reduced to Cr(III). It was
once proposed that sorption could be one major
mechanism for decreasing Cr(VI) availability in
soils, especially when soils have low pH and high
Fe and Al oxide contents (Fendorf et al, 1997;
Lee et al., 2005; Yu et al., 2004; Zachara et al.,
1989). However, the XANES results suggest that
it was the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III), and not
Cr(VI) adsorption that was the dominant mecha-
nism accounting for the decrease of soil available
Cr(VI) in Pc-soil. It should be noted however
that there was still around 55 mg kg)1 Cr(VI)
that could be extracted by the resin extraction
method when the Pc-soil was initially spiked with
500 mg kg)1 Cr(VI) (Table 2). This suggests that
the selective ion exchange resin method was a
more sensitive method to quantify Cr(VI) in soils
than the XANES method. At the same time it
might also be due to the storage of the soil sam-
ples used for the XANES analysis for 3 more
