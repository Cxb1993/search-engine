三、研究方法說明 
3-1 研究架構 
本研究根據文獻理論，建立研究架
構, 如圖 1 所示。依據文獻 IAEA 等理
論提出安全文化之構面，並依據理論基
礎建構這二個構面間的關係。 
3-2 研究假設 
本研究假設如下所列： 
假設一：安全文化之八個構面彼此間是
有相關性的。 
假設二：安全文化之八個構面可以用更
高階的構面來解釋。 
假設三：安全文化之最佳模式彼此間是
有相關性。 
3-3安全文化模式之驗證性因素分析設
計與假設 
驗證式因素分析（confirmatory 
factor analysis，CFA） 在量表的發展
上已經扮演相當重要的角色。最主要
的原因乃是CFA可以對理論做嚴謹的
檢定，研究者可以建立不同的模式，
從這些模式中選取最簡效的模式，模
式可包括虛無模式(null model)、單因
素模式(one-factor model)、多因素直
交模式(uncorrelated factors model)、多
因 素 斜 交 模 式 (correlated factors 
model)，以及多階層模式(hierarchical 
model)等。模式之界定是結構方程模
式(SEM)在應用上的重要步驟，本節
分別陳述安全文化八個構面的研究假
設並以徑路圖表示。徑路圖是以簡單
之徒刑呈現模式中要素的關連性，用
以呈現模式結構的整體輪廓。本研究
是屬於驗證性因素分析來驗證安全文
化之因素結構，其一系列競爭模式及
研究假設界定如下： 
1. 虛無模式：此模式假設安全文化量
表模式中沒有任何共同因素存
在，表示每一觀察變項均受到不同
因素之影響，亦即此量表中的題項
完全沒有共同因素可言。此模式之
適配性往往是最差的，目的乃在作
為一系列模式比較的基底模式
(baseline model)。 
2. 一階單因素模式：假設安全文化模
式的觀察變項，可以反映出一個共
同因素，而不是八個各別的因素(構
面)。 
 2
身作則行動力，極待加強。另外，從「
系統與組織」構面上，也發現，雖然企
業各廠大都以相同的組織架構進行運
作與交流，員工對於此構面的文化知覺
感受度，亦可能出現不相同的認同度。 
安全文化競爭模式之驗證 
一系列競爭模式經過模式驗證
後，整體適配指標整理如表1。以單一
因素模式而言，四個絕對適配指標皆未
達到接受模式的標準；增值適配指標也
未達到接受模式的標準； Normed 
Chi-Square 未通過門檻值，所以單因素
模式適配很不理想。對多因素直交模式
而言，四個絕對適配指標皆未達到接受
模式的標準；增值適配指標也未達到
接受模式的標準；Normed Chi-Square 
未通過門檻值。因此多因素直交模式的
表現與單一因素模式類似，即整體上大
部分的指標都未通過標準，因此依然無
法接受多因素直交模式。對多因素斜交
模式而言，其適配指標的改進則相當
多，由多因素斜交模式中可以發現，只
有GFI及AGFI略小於0.9 而拒絕模式之
外，其它所有的指標皆顯示模式可以
被接受。對二階單因素模式而言，
絕對適配指標中，GFI、AGFI與RMSEA
都未達標準而拒絕模式；增值適配指標
亦顯示拒絕模式;簡效適配指標中，
Normed Chi-Square也顯示模式遭受拒
絕。整體而言，二階單因素模式評鑑的
三類型指標中，皆有指標顯示該模式必
須被拒絕，所以判定拒絕二階單因素模
式。根據Baumgarther & Homburg 
(1996) 研究 1977-1994 年間採 SEM
進行資料分析的 184篇文獻中發
現，GFI與AGFI低於建議值0.9的文
獻比率分別為24%與48％，故可將
GFI與AGFI建議值放寬至0.8。若依
此則多因素斜交模式之整體適配
度皆達到標準，是建構安全文化的
最佳模式，其徑路圖與標準化參數
呈現於圖3。

safety culture within a petrochemical organization. Based on our through review of safety culture research, 
we adapted the safety culture structure developed by the International Atomic Energy Authority（IAEA）and 
constructed the evaluation questionnaires after reviewing content of a number of related measures of safety 
culture.  We identified eight global factors of safety culture including Organizational Commitment & Support, 
Safety Attitude & Behavior, Communication & Involvement, Safety Training & Competence, Safety 
Supervision & Audit, Management System & Organization, Accident Investigation & Response, and Reward 
& Promotion.  The 73-item questionnaire was distributed in a self-administered survey to 604 workers in a 
wide variety of types of jobs and 533 surveys were returned with a high response rate of 88.2%.  Our goal 
was to allow employees throughout the organization to give their personal assessment of these 
organizational safety culture factors.  The case was selected from five petrochemical companies which 
belong to the same mother company in Taiwan. While each of them has its own plant management, they 
have the same safety management structure and are regulated by the same national safety and health 
legislation. Statistical methods were used to analyze the collected data sets, including factor analysis, t-test, 
one-way ANOVA analysis of variance. This study was interested in determining whether employee’s 
background and environment variables affect differences, relation and calculation in safety culture level for 
different companies.  The results of safety culture assessment surveys were represented on a radar plot 
graph.  These plots provided a visual representation of safety culture profiles in different parts of the 
organization.  The results from this survey indicated positive overall performance in relation to 
organizational safety culture factors.  The results also allowed us to refine our assessment instrument to 
improve its usability and validity.  In addition, specific factors revealed areas in need of organization 
attention for improvement and suggestions from this study were provided for senior management’s in 
decision making on promoting the safety culture within the organization. 
Introduction 
Research on safety culture began in 1980s and the term safety culture was first introduced in the 
International Atomic Energy Agency’s initial report following the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster 
(INSAG, 1986). Over the years a number of definitions have been developed: Helmreich (1999) defined 
safety culture as “the outcome that organizations reach through a strong commitment to acquiring necessary 
data and taking proactive steps to reduce the probability of errors and the severity of those that occur.” Cox 
and Cheyne (2000) demonstrated that culture in general, and safety culture in particular is often 
characterized as the enduring aspect of an organization clearly and not easily changed. Wiegmann et al. 
(2002) defined as “the enduring value and priority placed on worker and public safety by everyone in every 
group at every level of an organization”. Perhaps the most widely used definition is that developed by the 
Advisory Committee on the Safety of Nuclear Installations in the UK (ACSNI, 1993): 
“The safety culture of an organisation is the product of individual and group values, attitudes, 
perceptions, competencies and patterns of behaviour that determine the commitment to, and 
the style and proficiency of, an organisation’s health and safety management.” 
Over the years several models and questionnaires have been developed by various researchers in an 
attempt to identify the key factors that comprise safety culture (HSE, 2005), there has been little agreement 
concerning which dimensions should be incorporated into safety culture. 
The purpose of this research was to develop a general measurement instrument based on extensive 
literature review that could be used to assess safety culture of a petrochemical company.  The objectives of 
this research were as follows: 
appropriate to apply the factor analytical technique. 
 
Participants 
The case was selected from five petrochemical plants (A, B, C, D, and E Plant) which belong to the same 
mother company located in different towns of Taiwan. While each of them has its own plant management, 
they have the same safety management structure and are regulated by the same national safety and health 
legislation.  The five sister-plants have the similar production lines and outputs and have in total about 700 
employees.  Furthermore, the workforces of the five plants are similar in terms of demographics as 
indicated in Table 3. Most respondents (over 95%) were male. The majority of the respondents (over 70%) 
were between 35 and 55 years of age. Over 80% were married.  More than one-thirds (33.3%) of the 
responderts described their primary job position as “Operating staff” Approximately three quarters of the 
respondents  (75%) indicated that they were not involved in any accident and injury.

Comparison of Different Backgrounds with Different Dimensions 
To see whether there are differences among personal background information of the respondents, t-test or 
one-way Analyses of Variance (ANOVA) were performed for each dimension of the safety culture.  Results 
showing significant difference are listed in Table 6. First of all there was no significant difference in all 
dimensions for the “Education” and “Injury Experience”. However in “Job Position”, management showed a 
significantly different perception from the remaining job positions in almost all dimensions except the “Safety 
Communication & Involvement” area. In “Work Experience”, respondents who had worked under 5 years 
showed a significantly different perception from the others. Workers with age above 45 perceived stronger 
safety perception than other age groups. Overall, the results of ANOVA suggest valuable insights into worker 
safety culture of this major petrochemical company and also give management the opportunity to consider 
the different background workers on how they perform on different dimensions.
