Abstract 
This study analyzed wear patterns of, and wear 
volume formulae for, hemispherical acetabular cup 
liners used in total hip replacement. This study also 
proposes two methods for exploring the wear 
volume of a worn liner. The first method is a 
numerical method, in which SolidWorks® software is 
used to create models of the worn out regions of 
liners at various wear directions and depths. The 
second method is an experimental one, in which a 
machining center is used to mill polyoxymethylene 
to manufacture worn and unworn liner models, then 
the volumes of the models are measured. The results 
show that the SolidWorks® software is a good tool 
for presenting the wear pattern and volume of a 
worn liner. The formulae and wear patterns 
described herein are crucial for more accurate 
performance evaluation of existing hip components 
implanted in patients, as well as for designing new 
hip components.

二、緣由與目的(Introduction) 
 
Many authors have studied 2D and 3D linear wear 
[1-4] and calculated the acetabular cup liner volume 
loss [5-12]. Charnley [5] first pointed out that the 
wear trajectory of an artificial femoral head is a 
straight line and that the wear volume is the maximal 
cross-sectional area of the femoral head multiplied 
by the wear depth. Kabo [6] proposed a formula and 
pointed out that the wear volume should be 
calculated from not only the wear depth, but also the 
direction of femoral head motion. However, Kabo’s 
formula has been found to produce errors as high as 
45% [9, 11]. After comparing many published 
formulae, Ilchmann [12] presented a new formula 
for a liner with a cylindrical portion. However, we 
found that all the formulae provided in the literature 
not only failed to show the wear patterns, but also 
produced some unreasonable results outside the 
theoretical upper limit.  
Although acetabular cup liner loss is due to wear, 
creep, and/or the effects of the ageing of 
polyethylene (PE) [13-16], this study did not attempt 
to distinguish between the different causes, but 
rather analyzed the shape of the bearing surface and 
the volume loss of worn regions at a given wear 
depth and direction. To be consistent with commonly 
used expressions, the wear volume is the total 
volume loss which is comprised of the effect of wear 
and creep. 
 
三、材料與方法(Materials and Methods) 
 
A. Type of acetabular cup liner 
This study examined the hemispherical liner 
which is simply a hemispherical shell (Fig. 1) and 
has been studied by others (Table 1). 
 
B. Notation illustration 
  Figure 2 shows the wear patterns and related 
notations of the liner. The inner radius of the 
hemispherical shell is given by r. The trajectory of 
the femoral head that penetrates the polyethylene

about 1.4, which overcomes the problem of the low 
specific gravity of PE. In additional, the mechanical 
attributes of POM make it more appropriate than 
ceramics or metals for machining.  
POM blocks were milled using a three-axis 
machining center with a tolerance of 0.01 mm. To 
stabilize the POM body and avoid overcutting 
during machining, the POM block was machined to 
form a base with an indented region resembling half 
of a worn or unworn surface of a real acetabular liner. 
(Fig. 5) 
Each POM liner model was suspended by a thin 
silk yarn and fully immersed in water in a beaker on 
an analytical balance.  
In this study, the volume of the worn POM model 
(Fig. 5b) was subtracted from that of the unworn 
POM model (Fig. 5a) to obtain the volume 
difference. The wear volume of the worn liner, i.e., 
the volume of the dotted region shown in Fig. 2, was 
then calculated by doubling the volume difference.  
G. Published formulae  
    The results obtained using five published 
formulae (Table 1) were compared to those obtained 
using the formulae proposed in this study. 
H. Formula accuracy criteria 
The following conditions are reasonable and must 
be met:  
1. The largest wear volume
maxV  arises in forward 
wear ( 90β = ° ), 2maxV r wpi= .  
2. The smallest wear volume minV  arises in lateral 
wear ( 0β = ° ), 2min max1 1V r w= V2 2pi= .  
 
四、結果(Results) 
The wear pattern and corresponding wear formula 
were determined according to the decision-making 
flowchart (Fig. 6). 
Formulae W,AV , W,BV , and W,90V  are:

classification. 
 
 
As shown in Fig. 7, most volumes yielded by 
SolidWorks® for hemispherical liners satisfied 
criteria. Due to errors resulting from machining and 
measuring, some data for POM models exceeded the 
theoretical maximum value,
maxV , but, despite this, 
the measured volumes for the POM models reflected 
the variation in the actual wear volume of a liner at 
different wear directions. 
Figure 8 demonstrates that the calculated results 
using the proposed formulae and those of the 
SolidWorks® models were very similar and the 
volume curve trends were consistent. The maximal

increased or the liner diameter decreased, the error 
produced by Ilchmann’s formula increased. When 
the liner diameter was 22 mm and the wear depth 5.0 
mm, the maximal difference was 2.35%. The volume 
overestimation occurs because Ilchmann was not 
aware that the wear region aq’ is comprised of arc ab 
and the line segment bq’ when the wear is Pattern B 
(Fig. 2). In other words, Ilchmann assumed that line 
segment bq’ was an arc with a diameter of 2r. As the 
wear depth increases, the line segment bq’ becomes 
longer and the error produced from approximating a 
line segment as an arc increases with the length of 
the line segment. In addition, an arc with a smaller 
diameter has a larger curvature and, thus, has a 
larger deviation from the line segment than an arc 
with a smaller curvature. As a result, Ilchmann’s 
formula produces a larger error when a smaller 
femoral head is used or a larger wear depth is 
created. 
  The formulae provided are just as complicated as 
the published formulae, but can be easily written as a 
computer program for clinical studies. In terms of 
accuracy, this study accounted for all wear patterns 
and no deviation from the proposed accuracy criteria 
occurred, and, thus, the proposed formulae are the 
most accurate and reliable.
