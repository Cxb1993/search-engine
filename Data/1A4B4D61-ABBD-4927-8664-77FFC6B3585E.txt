 
Abstract 
Nanosphere lithography technology was utilized in this work to 
prepare two-dimensional catalyst pattern on which the carbon nanotubes 
(CNTs) can grow.  Self-assembled close packed monolayer of 
polystyrene (PS) nanospheres on a substrate was used as the foundation 
for the catalyst deposition.  Two kinds of period catalyst pattern were 
made by using the nanosphere mask.  One is the honeycombs organic Ni 
pattern by dripping metal organic solution through the mask.  The other 
one is the Ni/Al capsules on PS nanospheres by deposition of catalytic 
metal on the mask. 
    CNTs were grown successfully on the two-dimensional period 
catalyst patterns.  Raman spectrum shows a low D-Band/G-Band (D/G) 
ratio.  The optimum conditions found in this study were the CNTs 
grown on the Ni (1 nm) / Al (10 nm) capsules on the PS nanospheres with 
a mixture of 1:1 methane and nitrogen gases at 550 Torr with a total flow 
rate of 400 sccm and the microwave generator was operated at 750 to 800 
watts for 20 minutes.  The peak at 198 (cm-1) and the TEM observation 
both indicate that the most of the CNTs are single wall carbon nanotubes 
(SWNTs).  Field emission measurements show that the CNTs grown on 
the two dimensional spherical array can give more than doubled current 
density than that grown on a flat surface.   
 
 
Introduction 
 
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted great interest due to their 
unique physical and chemical properties and their potential of  many 
possible applications.[1-3]  CNTs can be synthesized by a number of  
methods such as arc discharge,[4, 5] laser ablation,[6, 7] and chemical vapor 
deposition (CVD).[8, 9]  Different CNTs morphologies were obtained by 
various synthesis and fabrication techniques.  The possible applications 
of them in many fields including composite materials[10, 11], field-emission 
and nanoscale electronic devices[12, 13], etc., have been recently 
demonstrated.  For many applications, the CNTs grew on a 
two-dimensional pattern is desired and it is studied in this work. 
 
 
Results and discussions 
 
Figure 1(a) shows a Scanning electron microscopic image of the 
Ni/Al capsules on PS nanospheres, and figure 1(b) shows the 
honeycombs organic Ni pattern.  Both of them formed hexagonal 
close-packed period patterns.  Figure 1(c) shows an atomic force 
microscopic image of the honeycombs pattern, the peak height of the 
honeycombs Ni pattern is 30 nm.  For synthesizing the CNTs, the 
experimental parameters which included the pressure and the ratio of 
mixing gases, the flow rate of the gas mixture, and the power and the time 
applied by the microware generator were optimized.  It was found that 
CNTs were grown most successfully at the Ni/Al (1/10 nm) capsules on 
the PS nanospheres with a mixture of 1:1 methane and nitrogen gases at 
550 Torr with a total flow rate of 400 sccm and the microwave generator 
was operated at 750 to 800 watts for 20 minutes (Fig. 2(a)).   
CNTs of very small diameters were observed and some of them were 
observed to grow across the adjacent nanospheres.  The CNTs were 
characterized by Raman spectroscopy.  Figure 2(b) shows a typical 
spectrum with strong peak at 1581 (cm-1, G band) in the tangential mode 
and a weak peak at 1316 (cm-1, D band) was observed.  The low D/G 
(D-Band/G-Band) ratio indicates a good quality of the CNTs.  The peak 
at 198 (cm-1) is correspond to the radial breathing mode (RBM) of the 
SWNTs.  The can be calculated from the RBM frequencies by using the 
relation of wR (cm-1) = 248/d (nm).  It was found that the diameter of the 
SWNTs was 1.25 nm.  Fig. 3 is a TEM image showing the catalyst 
nanoparticles in the size of 5~10 nm and a SWNTs bundle formed on the 
Ni/Al capsules. 
To compare the properties of the CNTs grown on the two 
dimensional spherical array and that grown on a flat Si wafer, samples 
were prepared by growing CNTs on the Ni (1 nm) / Al (10 nm) on the PS 
nanospheres and the Si wafer sitting side by side in the reaction chamber, 
with the applied microwave power of 800 watts for 20 minutes.  Figure 
4(a) and 4(b) show the SEM images of the CNTs grown on the two 
dimensional spherical array and that grown on a flat Si wafer, respectively.  
The CNTs grown on the PS nanospheres were more uniform and cleaner 
than on the Si wafer.  Field emission measurements were performed 
under a pressure of 1.0 x 10-6 torr and indium tin oxide was used as anode.  
It was found that the turn-on field of the two dimensional spherical array
