Abstract 
Flow-induced vibration of a cylinder 
elastically mounted in the shear flow of a 
two-dimensional jet is investigated 
experimentally. Experiments were carried out 
under varying conditions of cylinder diameter, 
mass ratio and damping factor. By the 
experiment, it is shown that the cylinder in the 
shear layer could become fluid-elastically 
unstable, while a circular cylinder in uniform 
flow is always fluid-elastically stable. By the 
amplitude diagrams of the cylinder vibration, 
the critical fluid velocity for onset of the 
cylinder vibration due to fluid-elastically 
instability was determined. The dependence of 
the critical velocity on the mass ratio and 
damping factor are reported. Beyond the critical 
condition, the cylinder is shown to exhibit an 
oscillatory state.

1. 前言 
在工程應用中，常常可見長條的圓柱置
於流體中的情形，例如：空氣中的電線、海
底中的電纜，吊橋的鋼索，熱交換器內的圓
管。由於圓柱與周圍流場的相互作用，在某
些情況下，固體的圓柱會受流體流動的影響
而引起振動，振動嚴重者會導致固體的損
害 。 流 體 引 致 固 體 振 動 (Flow induced 
vibration)的主要來源可歸納為； (1)紊流
(Turbulence) (2) 渦 漩 引 起 的 不 穩 定
(Vortex-induced instability)，(3)流體-彈性不穩
定(Fluid-elastic instability)。其中，流體-彈性
不穩定誘發的固體振動，振幅往往最大，最
易造成損壞。例如，對於熱交換器中圓柱並
排於橫流的結構，流體-彈性的不穩定引起的
振動就是圓柱損壞的主因。由於流體流過多
圓柱結構的流場十分複雜，不穩定的臨界條
件大都仰賴實驗，整理出相關性。 
學理上，單一圓柱在橫流中引致振動的
問題就顯得基本而重要，當然單一圓柱也有
實際的應用，例如:單一的電纜線、並排但間
距大的電線，這些圓形電線的流體誘發振動
(flow-induced vibration)，基本上是單一圓柱
與流體交互作用的結果。 
有關彈性單一圓柱在橫流中誘發振動
的問題，過去有許多學者從實驗或理論計算
的方法去探討。限於單一圓柱在均勻橫流中
(uniform upstream)的振動問題，一些實驗(例
如：Brika＆Lanville 1993，Kiya et al. 1980)
已證實當圓柱後的渦漩剝離頻率(vortex 
shedding frequency)與圓柱的自然頻率接近
時，圓柱會產生振動，為渦漩誘發振動
(vortex-induced vibration)。 
在實際的情況，橫流流向圓柱往往是非
均勻的流場，例如：埋在近海的導管是處於
邊界層(boundary layer)流場，屬於剪切流
(shear flow)，就是非均勻的流場。圓柱在剪
切流場中的不穩定性質可能與在均勻流暢
中不同；均勻流場中的單一圓柱，只有渦旋
誘發振動的可能，理論上，沒有流體-彈性
不穩定的可能，目前也沒有實驗發現這樣子
的不穩定。但在剪切流場中的單一圓柱，以

Stability analysis of a two-dimensional circular cylinder in shear flow

ABSTRACT 
Stability of a two-dimensional circular cylinder in a 
cross flow of linear velocity profile is investigated 
theoretically. The study aims to obtain the critical 
conditions for onset of fluid elastic instability of the 
cylinder. Under quasi-steady assumption, the 
governing equations of the cylinder motion were 
derived and linearized for linear stability analysis. 
Meanwhile, the fluid forces of a circular cylinder in 
linear shear flow were computed by numerical method. 
The drag and lift coefficients of a smooth circular 
cylinder were obtained in a wide range of Reynolds 
number and shear parameter. With the linearized 
equations and the force coefficients, linear stability 
analysis was performed in the ranges of Reynolds 
number Re=100-800 and shear parameter K=0-0.2 to 
obtain the critical reduced velocity for onset of the fluid 
elastic instability. It is shown that the important 
parameters relevant to the stability of the cylinder are 
Reynolds number, shear parameter (non-dimensional 
velocity gradient), mass ratio, and damping factor. 
Stability analysis reveals that the stability of a circular 
cylinder in a linear shear flow is almost independent 
on the Reynolds numbers. However, the velocity 
gradient of the shear flow is crucial to the stability of 
the circular cylinder. The critical reduced velocity is 
dependent on the shear parameter as Rc~K-a, where 
a=1.5 approximately for the mass ratios, 500<M<5112, 
investigated. The result agrees well qualitatively with 
the previous experiment. It is evident that the velocity 
gradient of the shear flow is crucial to the stability of 
the circular cylinder--larger shear parameter of the 
cross flow results in lower critical velocity and hence 
promotes the instability of the circular cylinder. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Cylinders in fluid flow are common in engineering 
applications, such as offshore pipelines, electrical 
power transmission lines and cables of suspension 
bridges. Numerous studies have been conducted on 
the flow-induced vibrations of cylinders in uniform 
flows. In practice, long flexible cylinders are usually 
immersed in a non-uniform flow, such as offshore 
pipelines near the seabed. It is well known that that a 
circular cylinder in a uniform cross flow is always 
fluid-elastically stable, though it may exhibit 
vortex-induced instability (Brika & Laneville 1993; 
Willden & Graham 2001, among others). Recently, Yu 
et al. (2004) experimentally demonstrated that a 
circular cylinder in a shear flow could exhibit 
fluid-elastic vibrations. The experimental findings 
motivated this theoretic study to further investigate the 
fluid elastic instability of a circular cylinder in shear 
flow.  
For a two-dimensional circular cylinder flexibly 
mounted in a shear flow, its stability generally depend 
on the fluid properties, the flow conditions, and the 
characters of the cylinder. The density (ρ) and 
viscosity (μ) of the fluid are two independent 
properties for an isothermal fluid flow. For a linear 
shear laminar flow over a circular cylinder, the flow 
condition can be characterized by its velocity gradient 
(G) and the flow velocity approaching the cylinder 
center (U0). The major independent variables to 
describe a flexibly mounted circular cylinder with 
assumption of smooth surface are its diameter (D), 
mass per unit length (m), natural frequency (ωn in 
radians per second) and structural damping factor (ζ). 
It is noted that the stiffness (κ) of the cylinder is not an 
independent variable since it can be related to the 
mass and the natural frequency by ωn=(κ/m)1/2. In 
summary, there are seven dimensional parameters, 
namely ρ, μ, G, U0, D, m and ωn and a dimensionless 
parameter of damping factor ζ in studying the stability 
problem. These seven dimensional parameters can be 
grouped as four dimensionless parameters by 
applying Buckingham π-theorem. Four dimensionless 
parameters, Reynolds number ρU0D/μ, mass ratio 
m/(ρD2), reduced velocity U0/(ωnD) and shear 
parameter GD/U0, would be obtained if ρ, U0 and D 
are chosen as the basic variables to group with each 
of the other variables, μ, G, m and ωn. 
It would require tremendous efforts to conduct 
experiments for the dependence of the critical velocity 
on the parameters. Theoretical stability analysis, 
however, provides a useful approach to investigate the 
parametric dependences. In this study, linear stability 
analysis was carried out to predict the critical reduced 
velocity of a circular cylinder in linear shear flow, with 
a focus on the shear parameter effect on the cylinder 
stability. 
For the analysis, linearized governing equations 
were derived in detail, and the drag and lift coefficients 
of a fixed circular cylinder in linear shear flow were 
computed in a wide range of Reynolds number and 
shear parameter. The critical reduced velocity was 
then computed with the linearized equations and the 
force coefficients. After comparison with the data of 
the Yu et al. (2004) experiment, the critical reduced 
velocity is presented as a function of shear parameter 
at various mass ratios and damping factors. 
 
THE EQUATIONS OF MOTION 
As shown in Fig. 1, a spring-supported, damped model 
of a two-dimensional circular cylinder in a linear shear 
flow, U=U0+Gy, is considered in this study. It is 
assumed that the cylinder has the same stiffness 
regardless of the direction of cylinder displacement, 
and the stiffness is denoted as κ per unit length of the 
cylinder. The structural damping factor ζ that would be 
measured if the fluid were absent is also assumed to 
be independent on the direction of cylinder motion. 
The gravitational force is neglected. With the above

LINEARIZATION OF THE EQUATIONS 
The equations of motion can be written in 
dimensionless form by choosing the cylinder diameter 
(D) as the length scale, and the reciprocal of the 
natural frequency (1/ωn) as the time scale. By 
introducing the dimensionless displacements x =x/D 
and y =y/D, and the dimensionless time τ=ωnt, Eq.(4)

When the motions of the cylinder is relatively small, 
the nonlinear fluid forces xF  and yF  are linearized 
around the equilibrium point ( x , y )=(0, 0) for linear 
stability analysis. Linearization of the fluid forces in Eq. 
(9) were performed by using the following linear 
approximations, assuming x , y , x& , and y&  are very 
small compared to 1,

where CDo and C Lo and their derivatives on the 
right-hand side of Eq. (14) are evaluated at the 
equilibrium position. It is noted that the fluid force on a 
stationary cylinder in the shear flow, U=Uo+Gy, is not a 
function of x, and so the force coefficients. 
With these linear approximations, the fluid forces, 
xF  and yF  in Eq. (9), are linearized to give

where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to 
y . 
Substituting Eq. (15) into Eq. (8), the linearized 
equations of motion for the cylinder around the 
equilibrium point are

It is reminded that the drag and lift coefficients, and

at the equilibrium point, where the Reynolds number is 
Reo and the shear parameter is Ko, based on the local 
fluid velocity approaching the cylinder Uo. 
Since CD and CL are functions of Re and K for a 
circular cylinder in the linear shear flow, where 
Re=UD/ν, K=GD/U, and U=Uo+Gy, the derivatives of 
the force coefficients in Eq. (16) can be written as  
 
             
  (17) 
 
 
 
Each term on the right hand side of Eq. (17) is 
evaluated at Reo and Ko, the Reynolds number and 
shear parameter at the equilibrium point. Hereafter,

coefficients, CD and CL, in the equation are generally 
dependent on the Reynolds number, and also on the 
shear parameter when the cylinder is in a shear flow. 
Therefore, the critical reduced velocity depends on 
Reynolds number in general. The influence of 
Reynolds number on the critical reduced velocity is 
determined by two effects: how sensitive the growth 
rate is to the force coefficients, and how significantly 
the force coefficients vary with the Reynolds numbers 
in the investigated range.

The sensitivity of the critical reduced velocity to the 
CD–variation is examined by calculating the critical 
velocity using Eq. (20) with the values of CD computed 
numerically in the study, and the values of CD(1±10%) 
as well. The purpose of artificially increase or 
decrease 10% of the drag coefficient in calculating the 
critical velocity is to see how many percents of the 
critical velocity would change even if there were 10% 
error of the computed drag coefficients. As shown in 
Fig. 4, the deviation of the critical reduced velocity for 
each of the Reynolds numbers is within 3% if the drag 
coefficients were artificially increased or decreased 
10%. It is thus illustrated that the critical reduced 
velocity is not sensitive to the variation of the drag 
coefficients. Fig. 4 also shows that the critical reduced 
velocities are approximately a constant, Rc=165±5%, 
for the Reynolds numbers, 100<Re<800. The almost 
constant Rc is a result of relatively insensitive of the 
critical reduced velocity to the CD–variations and small 
variations of the drag coefficients in the Re-range. It is 
noted that the variation of the drag coefficient is about 
20% in the range of Re=100-800. 
The result of almost no Re-effect on the critical 
reduced velocity suggests that the magnitude of the 
drag force on the cylinder, which would increase with 
the Reynolds number, is not a key factor to the fluid 
elastic instability of the cylinder. The distribution of the 
fluid force on the cylinder surface, however, could be 
crucial to the stability of the cylinder. In a shear flow, 
the cylinder experiences lift force due to the uneven 
distribution of the fluid force in the cross-stream 
direction. Consequently, the cylinder could be 
unstable. 
 
SHEAR PARAMETER DEPENDENCE 
The critical reduced velocities calculated at different 
shear parameters and three Reynolds numbers are 
shown in Fig. 5. It is seen again that the Reynolds 
number effect on the critical velocity is minor. The 
critical reduced velocity, however, strongly depends on 
the shear parameter. As the shear parameter 
increases, the critical reduced velocity decreases. A 
curve of Rc∼K -a is drawn to fit the present data, where 
a=1.5. This result agrees, qualitatively at least, with 
the experimental result of Rc∼K -1.44 by Yu et al. (2004) 
The curve of the critical reduced velocity represents 
the boundary of fluid elastic stability/instability. When 
the reduced velocity is above the critical reduced 
velocity (the upper region of the boundary), the circular 
cylinder is fluid elastically unstable. On the other side, 
the circular cylinder is fluid elastically stable.

It is predicted by the diagram that the critical 
reduced velocity of a circular cylinder in a uniform 
cross flow (K=0) is infinite, which is consistent with the 
notion that a circular cylinder is fluid elastically stable 
in a uniform cross flow. A circular cylinder in a shear 
flow (K≠0), however, could become fluid elastically 
unstable, depending on the parameters of the 
equilibrium state. As illustrated in Fig. 5, the critical 
reduced velocity decreases significantly as the shear 
parameter increases, suggesting that a circular 
cylinder is more prone to fluid elastic instability in a 
shear flow with larger shear parameter.
