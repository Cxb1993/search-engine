and vapor quality except at low mass fluxes. A rise in the imposed heat flux results in a 
significant increase in the evaporation heat transfer coefficient except at low heat fluxes. 
Nevertheless the influence of the imposed heat flux on the frictional pressure drop is rather 
slight. At increasing saturated temperature of the refrigerant the evaporation heat transfer 
coefficient increases significantly. But an opposite trend is noted for the frictional pressure 
drop. As a result, both the convection and nucleation can be important. This is indeed the 
case according to the experimental data presented above. 
Then, the experimental heat transfer data for the saturated flow boiling of R-407C and 
R-410A in the horizontal narrow annular duct are examined and compared with R-134a. 
From the measured boiling curves, the temperature undershoot at ONB are insignificant for 
the saturated flow boiling of all refrigerants in the duct. The saturated flow boiling heat 
transfer coefficient of R-410A is higher than other refrigerants. Besides, raising the 
imposed heat flux can also cause a significant increase in the boiling heat transfer 
coefficients. However, the effects of the refrigerant mass flux and saturated temperature on 
the boiling heat transfer coefficient are small. The results from the flow visualization show 
that the mean diameter of the bubbles departing from the heating surface decreases slightly 
at increasing mass flux and saturated temperatures. Besides, the active nucleation site 
density for R-410A is significantly higher than other refrigerants.  
Correlations for the saturated flow boiling heat transfer coefficients of R-134a in the 
narrow annular duct are proposed. Besides, data for some quantitative bubble 
characteristics such as the mean bubble departure diameter, departure frequency and the 
mean active nucleation site density have been correlated. Besides, the empirical 
correlations for the evaporation heat transfer coefficient and friction factor in small circular 
tubes are proposed.

CHAPTER 1 
INTRODUCTION 
In the past decade following the signing of the Montreal Protocol, extensive 
research has been undertaken to search for the alternatives that can replace 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) refrigerants. It is well known that the use of the CFCs 
refrigerants, which contain chlorine and carbon, would lead to the ozone depletion 
and a consequent increase in ultraviolet radiation, and in turn would cause global 
warming. Due to these disadvantages, some hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and 
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) refrigerants have been developed and they are found to be 
the most useful alternatives to substitute for CFCs. The HCFCs refrigerants contain 
less chlorine than the CFCs and therefore were developed to serve as interim for 
CFCs. The HFCs refrigerants have zero ozone depletion potential (ODP) and were 
developed to offer long–term replacement to CFCs. In order to properly use these new 
refrigerants, we need to understand their thermodynamic, transport and heat transfer 
properties. In particular, a detailed understanding of the characteristics of the 
evaporation and condensation heat transfer for the HFCs refrigerants is very important 
in the design of evaporators and condensers for many refrigeration and air 
conditioning systems. 
1-1 Alternatives to HCFC-22  
Due to the serious destruction of the ozone layer in the outer atmosphere by the 
CFCs refrigerants, various new refrigerants such as R-134a, R-407C, and R-410A 
were recently developed and introduced into the refrigeration and air conditioning 
systems. The HCFC-22, one of the HCFCs, offers excellent performance and is 
 1
certain applications, the higher temperature glides in the zeotropes offer the potential 
for higher efficiencies [3, 4]. 
1-2 Literature Review – Two Phase Heat Transfer and Pressure 
Drop 
In the following the relevant literature on the boiling heat transfer of refrigerants 
in various tubes, such as smooth, micro-fin and other enhanced tubes, is briefly 
reviewed. Wang et al. [5] studied the two phase heat transfer of R-22 and R-407C 
within a smooth tube with a nominal diameter of 9.52 mm. They chose the 
evaporation pressure of 600 kPa at which the transport properties of R-407C are 
similar to those of R-22. The heat transfer coefficients for R-407C were found to be 
50 to 70 % lower than those for R-22. But the pressure drop of R-407C was similar to 
that of R-22 at a low mass flux (G=100 kg/m2s) and was 45 % lower compared to 
R-22 at a higher mass flux (G=300 kg/m2s). The degradation in the R-407C 
evaporation heat transfer coefficient and friction gradient was attributed to the 
difference in the two-phase flow patterns. In a continuing study for a 9.52 mm 
micro-fin tube [6], they found that the heat transfer coefficients for R407C were 50 to 
80 % lower and the pressure drop of R-407C is 30 to 50 % lower, as compared to 
R-22. In a further study [7] they considered a smaller smooth tube of 6.5 mm in 
diameter and investigated the flow pattern difference between R-22 and R-407C. 
Their results suggested that the heat transfer degradation for R-407C was the 
consequence of the delay of the flow pattern transition. Shin et al. [8] studied forced 
convective boiling heat transfer of pure refrigerants and refrigerant mixtures in a 
horizontal tube. They concluded that due to the gravity the liquid film at the top of the 
tube is thinner than that at the bottom and the heat transfer coefficient at the top is 
higher than that at the bottom. They also noted that the heat transfer coefficients were 
 3
pipes (Di = 2.0 mm). Their results revealed that the evaporation heat transfer in the 
small pipes was more effective than that in large tubes. Flow boiling heat transfer of 
R-11 and R-123 in a smooth copper tube (Di = 1.95 mm) was investigated by Bao et 
al. [13]. The heat transfer coefficients were found to be independent of the mass flux 
and vapor quality, but are strong functions of heat flux and system pressure in the 
saturation region, suggesting that the heat transfer mechanism is dominated by the 
bubble nucleation. The two phase heat transfer of R-141b in a small tube (Di = 1.0 
mm) preformed recently by Lin et al. [14] showed that at a low vapor quality, the heat 
transfer was dominated by the nucleation. But in the high vapor quality region, the 
heat transfer was dominated by the force convection. Yu et al. [15] studied the 
two-phase pressure drop, boiling heat transfer, and critical heat flux of water in a 
small-diameter horizontal tube (Di = 2.98 mm). They showed that the transition 
boiling was a function of heat flux only. In addition, the boiling heat transfer was 
found to be dependent of the heat flux but essentially independent of mass flux. 
Single phase forced convection and subcooled and saturated boiling heat transfer and 
pressure drop of FC-84 in narrow rectangular channels with a hydraulic diameter of 
0.75 mm were recently investigated by Warrier et al. [16]. Two new heat transfer 
correlations were proposed, one for the subcooled flow boiling and the other for the 
saturated flow boiling. Fujita et al. [17] measured flow boiling heat transfer of R-123 
in a uniformly heated horizontal small tube (Di = 1.12 mm). They explained that the 
domination of the boiling heat transfer in small tubes by the bubble nucleation was 
owing to the fact that the boiling number became rather high in small tubes when 
compared to large diameter tubes. The flow pattern observed in the small tube 
indicated that the stratified flow did not exist. And the influences of the surface 
tension became more substantial in smaller tubes. Besides, the friction factor was 
nearly independent of the Reynolds number of the flow.  
 5
their study the flow boiling phenomenology consists of two parts, flow excursion and 
confinement instability. They noted that when the instabilities developed in the 
channel, the surface temperature increased and the average heat transfer coefficient 
decreased. 
Two phase flow and adiabatic single phase flow pressure drops of R-12 flowing 
in both rectangular channel with a hydraulic diameter of 2.64 mm and micro-fin small 
tubes (Di = 1.56 mm) were measured by Yang et al. [22]. The two phase pressure 
gradient was found to increase with the mass velocity and vapor quality of the 
refrigerant. The surface tension force played no significant role in affecting the 
frictional pressure drop in the micro-fin tube. Additionally, the pressure drop in 
micro-fin tube is higher than that in the plain tube in most situations. In a continuing 
study [23] for water, R-134a and air in small tubes (Di = 0.173 to 4.01 mm), they 
showed that the single phase pressure drop with R-134a in small tubes could be 
empirically correlated by the conventional Blasius and Poiseuille equations. In 
capillary tubes (Di = 1.2 to 1.6 mm) with pure refrigerant and their mixtures, Chang et 
al. [24] suggested that the pressure drop in the tubes resulted mainly from the friction 
on the tube wall and the flow acceleration associated with the variation in the specific 
volume of the fluid. The homogeneous flow model was shown to be appropriate for 
calculating the pressure drop of two phase flow in capillary tubes at high liquid flow 
rate. Tong et al. [25] measured the pressure drop for highly subcooled flow boiling of 
water in small tubes (Di = 1.05 to 2.44 mm). Their data manifested that both single 
and two phase pressure drops increased with increasing mass flux and 
length-to-diameter ratio but decreased with increasing internal diameter of the tube. 
Inlet and exit temperatures of water exhibited significant influences on the two phase 
pressure drop but had invisible effects on the single phase pressure drop. 
 7
subcooled flow boiling and the associated bubble characteristics of R-134a in a 
horizontal annular channel (Dh＝10.3 mm) were examined recently by Yin et al. [27]. 
Results from their flow visualization indicated that the bubble generation was 
suppressed by raising the mass flux and subcooling, and only the liquid subcooling 
showed a significant effect on the bubble size. Finally, an empirical correlation for the 
bubble departure diameter was provided.  
Thorncroft et al. [33] experimentally investigated upflow and downflow boiling 
of FC-87 in vertical rectangular channel (Dh＝12.7 mm). They indicated that both 
bubble growth and bubble departure rates increased with the Jacob number, but 
decreased with the mass flux. Besides, the bubble waiting time decreased with an 
increase in the heat flux. This increase in the heat transfer was directly attributed to 
the sliding vapor bubbles, which remained attached to the wall during the upflow and 
lift off from the wall during the downflow. The sliding of the bubbles on the boiling 
surface was found to enhance heat transfer in forced convection boiling of FC-87 in a 
vertical upflow and downflow by Thorncroft and Klausner[34]. An experimental 
investigation of low pressure subcooled flow boiling inside a vertical concentric 
annulus(Dh＝13.0 mm) from Zeitoun and Shoukri [35] confirmed that the bubble 
departure was not the reason for the net vapor generation (NVG). However, the mean 
size and lift duration of the bubbles increased at decreasing liquid subcooling. 
Moreover, a new correlation for the mean bubble diameter in terms of the Reynolds 
number, boiling number, local Jacob number, and fluid properties was proposed. 
Klausner et al. [36] developed a criterion for the bubble departure from the heated 
surface in the forced convection boiling. The study was carried out for a saturated 
two-phase mixture of refrigerant R-113 flowing through a 25×25 mm2(Dh＝25.0 
mm2) visual boiling section. They found that the mean bubble departure diameter 
 9
is dependent on the critical radius of the nucleus rc, their data are not sufficient for 
correlating Nac. From their data, they concluded that the vapor velocity, heat flux, and 
system pressure have strong effects on Nac. Kocamustafaogullari and Ishii [42] 
developed a relation for active nucleation site density in pool boiling from the data 
available in the literature. They also applied the correlation to the few available forced 
convection nucleate boiling data. Their correlation expressed the active nucleation site 
density in dimensionless form as a function of dimensionless minimum cavity size 
and density ratio. The correlation was valid for the system pressure ranging from 1.0 
to 198.0 bar. Basu et al [43] proposed an empirical correlation including the effect of 
the contact angle on the active nucleation site density during forced convective 
boiling of water on a vertical surface based on their experimental data. They 
performed subcooled boiling experiment at the atmospheric pressure. In the 
experiments, they utilized mirror-finished copper surfaces prepared by a well-defined 
procedure. They varied the wettability of the surface by controlling the degree of 
oxidation of the surface. 
1-4 The Objective of This Study  
In recent years, environmental concerns over the use of CFCs as working fluids 
in refrigeration and air-conditioning systems have led to the development of 
alternative fluids. Among these alternatives, R-134a, R-407C and R-410A are used as 
substitutes for the HCFC-22. Moreover, considerable effort has recently been devoted 
to improve the design of more compact and efficient evaporators for the process and 
refrigeration industries. While a great number of papers have been written on the flow 
boiling heat transfer, only several of them consider the associated bubble 
characteristics for the widely used new refrigerants (like R-134a, R-407C, R-410A) 
particularly in small channels. In this study, the saturated flow boiling of new

CHAPTER 2 
EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS AND PROCEDURES 
 
The experimental apparatus used in the present study to investigate the characteristics 
of saturated flow boiling and evaporation heat transfer of new refrigerant (R-134a or 
R-407C or R-410A) in a horizontal narrow annular duct and in horizontal small tubes are 
schematically shown in Figs.2.1 and 2.2 respectively. The apparatus consists of three main 
loops, namely, a refrigerant loop, a water-glycol loop and a hot-water loop for preheater, 
along with a data acquisition system and a 50V-25A DC power supply. Refrigerants are 
circulated in the refrigerant loop. We need to control the temperature and flow rate in the 
water-glycol loop to obtain enough cooling capacity for condensing the refrigerant vapor 
and for maintaining the refrigerant liquid at a preset temperature. The liquid refrigerant in 
the narrow duct is heated by passing a DC current through the inner pipe in the test section 
from the DC power supply. To unravel the bubble characteristics in the boiling of 
refrigerant on the heating surface, a high-speed movie camera connected to a photographic 
microscope is set up beside the test section to observe the boiling flow. 
2.1 Refrigerant flow loop 
The main components in the refrigerant loop include an oil-free variable-speed 
refrigerant pump, an accumulator, a mass flow meter, a test section, a condenser, a 
sub-cooler, a receiver, a filter/dryer and four sight glasses. An AC motor is used to control 
the refrigerant mass flow rate through the change of the inverter frequency. The flow rate 
can also be adjusted by regulating the by-pass valve installed in the by-pass flow path. The 
refrigerant at the outlet of the refrigerant pump is kept subcooled to avoid any vapor flow 
13 
( corresponding to the gap size of 2.0, 1.0, 0.5 or 0.2 mm for the duct). In order to insure 
the gap between the ducts being uniform, we first measure the average outside diameter of 
the inner pipe and the mean inside diameter of the Pyrex glass, with the accuracy of the 
measurement in the range of ±0.01 mm. Then we photo the top and side view pictures and 
measure the average distance between the inside surface of the Pyrex glass pipe to the 
outside surface of the inner tube, with the accuracy also in the range of ±0.01mm. From 
the above procedures the duct gap is ascertained and its uncertainty is estimated to be 0.02 
mm. An electric cartridge heater of 160 mm in length and 13.0 mm in diameter with a 
maximum power output of 800W is inserted into the inner pipe. Furthermore, the pipe has 
an inactive heating zone of 10 mm long at each end and is insulated with Teflon blocks and 
thermally nonconducting epoxy to minimize heat loss from it. Thermal contact between the 
heater and the inner pipe is improved by coating a thin layer of heat-sink compound on the 
heater surface before the installation of the heater. Then, 8 T-type calibrated thermocouples 
are electrically insulated  by covering their beads with the electrically nonconducting 
thermal bond before they are fixed on the inside surface of the inner pipe so that the 
voltage signals from the thermocouples are not interfered by the DC current passing 
through the cartridge heater. The thermocouples are positioned at three axial stations along 
the smooth pipe. At each axial station, two to four thermocouples are placed at top, bottom, 
or two sides of the pipe circumference with 180° or 90° apart. The outside surface 
temperature Tw of the inner pipe is then derived from the measured inside surface 
temperature by taking into account the radial thermal conduction through the pipe wall. 
Figure 2.4 shows the detailed thermocouple locations at each axial station and the 
arrangement of the cartridge heater.  
The test section for the new refrigerant in small tubes is described next. Due to the 
tubes tested being relatively small, the refrigerant flow rates in them are very low and 
15 
2.3 Water loop for preheater 
In order to maintain the preset refrigerant temperature at the test section inlet, a water 
loop is used to preheat the refrigerants before it arrives at the inlet. The water loop for the 
preheater system includes a double-tube, having a heat transfer area of 0.12m2, a 125-liter 
hot water container with three 2.0-kW heaters in it, and a 0.5-hp water pump which can 
deliver the hot water at specified temperature and flow rate to the preheater. In the 
preheater the hot water passes through the outer pipe while the liquid refrigerant flows in 
the inner pipe. The water flow rate is controlled by an AC motor through the change of the 
inverter frequency and by the by-pass valve. The connecting pipe between the preheater 
and test section is thermally insulated with a 5-cm thick polyethylene layer to reduce the 
heat loss from the pipe. 
2.4 Water-glycol loop 
The water-glycol loop is designed for condensing the refrigerant vapor and for 
subcooling the liquid refrigerant. The water-glycol loop is cooled by a water cooled R-22 
refrigeration system. The cooling capacity is 3.5-kW for the water-glycol mixture at -20℃. 
The cold water-glycol mixture at a specified flow rate is driven by a 0.5-hp pump to the 
condenser as well as to the subcooler. A by-pass loop is provided to adjust the flow rate. By 
adjusting the mixture temperature and flow rate, the bulk temperature of the refrigerant in 
the subcooler can be controlled at a preset level. 
2.5 DC Power Supply 
As described above, the inner pipe in the test section is heated by a 800-W cartridge 
heater. A 50V-25A DC power supply delivers the required electric current to the cartridge 
heater. A Yokogawa DC meter is used to measure the DC current through the cartridge 
17 
signals are collected and converted by a data acquisition system (Hybrid recorder). The 
converted signals are then transmitted to a host computer through a GPIB interface for 
further calculation. 
The system automatically monitors all the T-Type thermocouples, pressure 
transducers, differential pressure transducer and mass flowmeters. The thermodynamic and 
transport properties of the refrigerants are obtained by the manual from AlliedSignal Co. 
Ltd. and by the ASHRAE handbook. 
2.8 Experimental procedures 
Before a test is started, the temperature of the refrigerant under investigation in the 
test section is compared with its saturation temperature corresponding to the measured 
saturation pressure and the allowable difference is kept in the range of 0.2-0.3K. Otherwise, 
the system is re-evacuated and then re-charged to remove the air existing in the refrigerant 
loop. In the test the liquid refrigerant or liquid-vapor refrigerant mixture at the inlet of the 
test section is first maintained at a specified temperature and/or quality by adjusting the 
water-glycol temperature and flow rate. In addition, we adjust the thermostat temperature 
in the water loop to stabilize the refrigerant temperature and/or quality at the test section 
inlet. Then, we regulate the refrigerant pressure at the test section inlet by adjusting the 
opening of the gate valve locating right after the exit of the test section. Meanwhile, by 
changing the current of the DC motor connecting to the refrigerant pump, the refrigerant 
flow rate can be varied. The imposed heat flux from the heater to the refrigerant is adjusted 
by varying the electric current delivered from the DC power supply. By measuring the 
current delivered to and voltage drop across the heater and photographing the bubble 
activity, we can calculate the heat transfer rate to the refrigerant and obtain the bubble 
characteristics. All tests are run at statistically steady-state conditions. The whole system is

DATA REDUCTION 
 
 In the present study of heat transfer and bubble characteristics in the flow boiling of 
new refrigerants in an annular duct, the gap between the inner and outer circular pipes is 
varied from 0.2 to 2.0 mm. Besides, the evaporation heat transfer coefficient and pressure 
drop of R-407C flow in the small tubes are measured. The data reduction analyses are 
needed to calculate the flow boiling and evaporation heat transfer coefficient and pressure 
drop from the raw data measured in the test sections. 
3.1 Flow Boiling Heat Transfer Coefficient in Annular Duct 
 The imposed heat flux to the refrigerant flow in the annular duct is calculated on the 
basis of the total power input and the total outside heat transfer area of the inner pipe of 
the annular duct. The total power input is computed from the product of the measured 
voltage drop across the cartridge heater and the electric current passing through it. The 
imposed heat flux at the outside surface of the inner pipe is then evaluated from the 
relation 
sAVIq /=   (3.1) 
where V and I respectively represent the measured voltage drop and current. Before the 
two-phase experiments, the total heat loss from the test section is evaluated by comparing 
the total power input from the power supply Qs with the total heat transfer rate to the 
single phase refrigerant flow expressed as cs prG A c T⋅ ⋅ ⋅ Δ , where Acs is the 
cross-sectional area of the annular duct and ΔT is the difference in the refrigerant 
temperature at the exit and inlet of the test section. The relative heat loss from the test 
section is defined as 
s cs prQ G A c T) / Qε − ⋅ ⋅ ⋅Δ＝( s  (3.2) 
The results from this heat loss test indicate that the heat loss from the test section is

While the heat transfer to the refrigerant in the preheater is the summation of the sensible 
heat transfer (for the temperature rise of the refrigerant to the saturated value) and latent 
heat transfer (for the evaporation of the refrigerant), 
w,p sens latQ =Q +Q   (3.8)

The above equations can be combined to evaluate the refrigerant quality at the exit of the 
preheater that is considered to be the same as the vapor quality of the refrigerant entering 
the test section. Specifically,

3.2 Uncertainty Analysis 
 Uncertainties of the heat transfer coefficients are estimated according to the 
procedures proposed by Kline and McClintock for the propagation of errors in physical 
measurement [46]. The results from this uncertainty analysis are summarized in Table 3.1

The results from the single-phase heat transfer tests indicate that the energy balance 
between the heater and the refrigerant flow defined in Eq.(3.2) is within 5% for all run. 
This insures the heat loss from the test section is rather small and the design of test section 
is suitable for our measurement. The results in Figure 4.1 manifest that forδ=0.5-2.0 mm 
the present data for hl can be well correlated with the Gnielinski correlations. But for the 
smaller gap of 0.2 mm the Choi correlation is closer to the present data. 
4.2 Saturated Flow Boiling Curves 
The effects of the refrigerant mass flux, gap size of the duct  and refrigerant 
saturated temperature on the saturated flow boiling characteristics at the middle axial 
location (z =80 mm) of the narrow annular duct are shown in Figures 4.2-4.6 by presenting 
the boiling curves for various G, δ and Tsat. 
First, the effects of the refrigerant mass flux on the saturated flow boiling curves are 
shown in Figures 4.2 and 4.3. The results indicate that at a low imposed heat flux the wall 
superheat is lower than that for the onset of nucleate boiling (ONB) and no bubble 
nucleates from the heating surface. Hence heat transfer in the flow results completely from 
36 
location (z =80 mm) in the narrow annular duct are shown in Figures 4.8-4.12 by 
presenting the saturated flow boiling heat transfer coefficient against the imposed heat flux 
for various G, δ and Tsat. The results indicate that at given G, δand Tsat the saturated 
boiling heat transfer coefficient increases substantially with the imposed heat flux. For 
example, at Tsat =15℃, δ=0.5 mm and G =500 kg/m2s, the saturated boiling heat transfer 
coefficient for q =46 kW/m2 is about 91% higher than that for q = 6 kW/m2 (Figure 4.9(a)). 
This large increase in the saturated boiling heat transfer coefficient is ascribed to the higher 
active nucleation site density on the heating surface and higher bubble departure frequency 
for a higher imposed heat flux. The effects of the refrigerant mass flux on the saturated 
flow boiling heat transfer coefficient shown in Figures 4.8 and 4.9 manifest that the 
saturated boiling heat transfer coefficient rises slightly with the refrigerant mass flux only 
at a high q forδ=0.5  and 0.2 mm. For instance, the saturated boiling heat transfer 
coefficient at q =46 kW/m2, Tsat =15℃ and δ=0.5 mm for G =600 kg/m2s is about 5% 
higher than that for G =500 kg/m2s (Figure 4.9(a)). For the larger δ of 1.0 and 2.0 mm 
the effects of G and hr are negligible, as evident from the data in Figure 4.8. 
Then, the effects of the gap size of the duct on the saturated flow boiling heat transfer 
coefficient are shown in Figure 4.10. The data show that the saturated boiling heat transfer 
increases noticeably with a decrease in the channel gap. For example, at q =46 kW/m2, Tsat 
=15℃ and G =500 kg/m2s the saturated boiling heat transfer coefficient forδ=0.5 mm is 
about 31% higher than that forδ=2.0 mm (Figure 4.10(a)). Besides, at G =600 kg/m2s and 
the same q and Tsat the saturated boiling heat transfer coefficient forδ=0.2 mm is about 
32% higher than that forδ=1.0 mm (Figure 4.10(b)). Since the shear stress of the flow 
acting on the heated surface in a smaller channel becomes higher, the cavities on the 
heating surface can be more easily wetted. Moreover, the flow pattern changes from the 
bubbly flow forδ= 2.0 & 1.0 mm to become a slug flow forδ= 0.5 & 0.2 mm. These 
effects are thought to be the main reasons for the enhancement of nucleate and convection 
boiling heat transfer when the channel size is reduced. Finally, the data shown in Figures 
4.11 and 4.12 suggest that the saturation temperature of the refrigerant exhibits negligible 
effects on the boiling heat transfer coefficient. 
4.4 Bubble Characteristics in Saturated Flow Boiling  
38 
ofδto 0.2 mm the bubble coalescence is so intense that the slug flow dominates the upper 
portion of the entire duct (Figure 4.16). The above results manifest that in the smaller ducts 
of 0.5& 0.2 mm the bubbly flow and slug flow coexist. 
 The photos of the boiling flow taken for the cases at different duct sizes and imposed 
heat fluxes in the small region around the middle axial location marked on Figures 
4.13(a)-4.16(a) are shown in Figure 4.17. First of all, it is noted from the photo taken from 
the duct forδ=1.0 mm shown in Figure 4.17(a) for the case at Tsat=15℃ and G=600 
kg/m2s at the imposed heat flux q=15 kW/m2 that a number of discrete bubbles nucleate 
from the cavities and slide along the heating surface. As the imposed heat flux is increased 
to q=25 kW/m2, the active bubble nucleation density increases and a lot more bubbles 
appear and they move faster (Figure 4.17(b)). Many coalescence bubbles are seen as the 
heat flux is raised to q=35 kW/m2 (Figure 4.17(c)). Then, the photos taken from the smaller 
duct with δ=0.5 mm shown in Figure 4.17(d) for the same G, q, and Tsat indicate that a 
large number of bubbles generated from the cavities in the heating surface tend to merge 
together to form big bubbles. As the bubbles become larger, they become distorted and 
elongated as they slide on the heating surface. As the imposed heat flux is increased 
slightly to q=25 kW/m2 (Figure 4.17(e)), the active bubble nucleation density increases and 
bubbles collide and coalesce more frequently. The coalescence bubbles rise faster than the 
tiny bubbles due to the larger buoyancy force associated with them. As the heat flux is 
raised to q=35 kW/m2 (Figure 4.17(f)), coalescence of the bubbles occurs irregularly at a 
very high rate. The coalescence bubbles can be very large. In fact, the liquid slugs and 
discrete bubbles coexist in the duct. At even higher imposed heat flux for q>30 kW/m2, the 
bubble departure frequency is very high so that it is difficult to clearly distinguish the 
individual bubbles. In general, the bubble departure frequency increases substantially with 
the imposed heat flux due to the fact that an increase in the imposed heat flux directly 
provides more energy to the cavities and more cavities on the heating surface can be 
activated. Besides, the bubble departure diameter increases slightly at increasing imposed 
heat flux due to the rise in the wall superheat. Then, the corresponding photo taken from 
the even smaller duct withδ=0.2 mm are shown in Figures 4.17(g)~(i) for the same G, q 
and Tsat. Note that for the smallerδmore coalescence bubbles are seen and they are even 
bigger especially at a higher imposed heat flux. This causes less bubbles nucleated at the 
heated surface. 
40 
relatively small. Finally, the results in Figures 4.22 and 4.23 indicate that the average 
bubble departure diameter is smaller for a higher refrigerant saturated temperature. For 
instance, at q =30 kw/m2, G =500 kg/m2s and δ= 2.0 mm, and the average departing 
bubble for Tsat =10℃ is about 18% larger than that for Tsat =15℃ (Figure 4.22(a)). 
How the bubble departure frequency is affected by the three parameters for the 
saturated flow boiling of R-134a at the middle axial location (z =80 mm) in the annular 
duct are shown in Figures 4.24-4.28 by presenting the average bubble departure frequency 
against the heat flux for various G, δ and Tsat. Note that the increase of the bubble 
departure frequency with the imposed heat flux is rather significant for all cases presented 
here. First, the effects of the refrigerant mass flux on the saturated flow boiling average 
bubble departure frequency are shown in Figures 4.24 and 4.25. The results indicate that 
the average bubble departure frequency is somewhat higher for a higher refrigerant mass 
flux especially at high imposed heat flux. For example, at q =26 kw/m2, Tsat =15℃ and δ
= 0.2 mm, the average bubble departure frequency for G =700 kg/m2s is about 14% higher 
than that for G =600 kg/m2s (Figure 4.25(b)). Then, the effects of the duct size on the 
saturated flow boiling average bubble departure frequency shown in Figure 4.26 manifests 
that the average bubble departure frequency is noticeably higher in the smaller duct. For 
instance, at q =26 kw/m2, Tsat =15℃ and G =500 kg/m2s the average bubble departure 
frequency forδ= 0.5 mm is about 23% higher than that forδ= 2.0 mm (Figure 4.26(a)). 
Besides, at G =600 kg/m2s and at the same q, and Tsat the average bubble departure 
frequency forδ= 0.2 mm is about 29% higher than that forδ= 1.0 mm (Figure 4.26 (b)). 
Finally, the data given Figures 4.27 and 4.28 indicate that the average bubble departure 
frequency is significantly higher for a higher saturated temperature. As an example, at q 
=26 kw/m2, G =600 kg/m2s and δ= 0.2 mm the average bubble departure frequency for 
Tsat =15℃ is about 21% higher than that for Tsat =10℃ (Figure 4.28(b)). 
The number density of the active nucleation sites for ONB affected by the three 
parameters for the saturated flow boiling of R-134a at the middle axial location (z =80 mm) 
in the annular duct are shown in Figures 4.29-4.33 by presenting the average active 
nucleation site density against the imposed heat flux for various G, δ and Tsat. The data 
clearly show the substantial increase of the active nucleation site density with the imposed 
heat flux for all cases examined here. First, the effects of the refrigerant mass flux on the 
42 
substantially larger whenδ is reduced from 0.5 mm to 0.2 mm. This is more pronounced 
at high heat flux. For example, at q =40 kw/m2, Tsat =15℃ and G =600 kg/m2s, the 
average bubble speed forδ= 0.2 mm is about 29% higher than that forδ= 0.2 mm (Figure 
4.35). Finally, the results in Figure 4.36 indicate that the average bubble speed is 
significantly higher for a higher saturated temperature especially at a high heat flux. For 
instance, at q =40 kw/m2, G =500 kg/m2s and δ= 0.5 mm the average bubble speed for 
Tsat =10℃ is about 25% lower than that for Tsat =15℃ (Figure 4.36(a)). 
4.5 Correlation Equations 
 According to flow boiling mechanisms, the heat transfer in the flow boiling in the 
bubbly flow regime can be roughly considered as a combination of single-phase 
convection heat transfer qc and pool boiling heat transfer qb. Thus the total heat flux input 
to the boiling flow qt can be expressed as 
cbt qqq +=                                (4.5) 
Here qb and qc can be calculated from the relations  
 b g g acq V f N fgiρ=                            (4.6) 
and 
1 s Tcq E h φ= Δ at                                (4.7) 
Note that qb expressed in Equation(4.6) in fact represents the latent heat carried away from 
the heating surface during the departure of bubbles from the surface. The single-phase 
forced convection heat transfer coefficient is estimated from the correlation for the 
enhanced factor E and the Nusselt number 1Nu φ  as 
1 1 l k hh Nu Dφ φ=                            (4.8)

Note that 1Nu φ  is estimated from the Gnielinski and Choi correlations [48, 51],

Note that more than 85 % of the experimental data for pf d⋅  collected in this study can be 
correlated within ±30% by Equation (4.14) and the mean absolute error is 13.1%(Figure 
4.38). Finally, we propose an empirical correlation for the average active nucleation site 
density in the saturated flow boiling of R-134a as

Figure 4.39 shows that the present experimental data fall within ±30% of the above 
correlation and the mean absolute error is 29.6%. 
When the correlations for pd , , and  given in Equations (4.13)-(4.15) are 
combined with Equations (4.5)-(4.12) for , the heat transfer data measured in the 
present study fall within ±30% of the correlation proposed here with the mean absolute 
error of 29.17%(Figure 4.40).

For the smaller ducts withδ= 0.5 & 0.2 mm the slug flow (confined bubbles) prevails 
at a high imposed heat flux, the associated flow boiling heat transfer data from the present 
measurement are correlated by modifying the correlation of Cornwell and Kew [29] for the 
confined bubble regime as

The results showed that the measured single-phase heat transfer coefficients for 
R-407C in the small tubes are in reasonable agreement with the two correlations. 
5-2 Two-Phase Evaporation Heat Transfer 
The effects of the refrigerant vapor quality, mass flux, saturated temperature and 
imposed heat flux on the evaporation heat transfer coefficient of refrigerant R-407C in 
the horizontal small circular tubes are shown in Figs. 5.2-5.10. The measured heat 
transfer coefficients are inspected by checking their variations with the vapor quality 
at the test section inlet inx . Since the tubes are short, the total vapor quality change 
xΔ  in the tubes for various cases in the present test is relatively small, ranging from 
0.01 to 0.03. At first, Fig. 5.2 shows the variations of the evaporation heat transfer 
coefficient with the inlet vapor quality of the refrigerant at q = 5 kW/m2 for different 
mass fluxes and saturated temperatures of R-407C. The results show that at this low 
imposed heat flux the evaporation heat transfer coefficient only increases very slightly 
with the inlet vapor quality for given G, Tsat and q. But the increases of hr with the 
refrigerant mass flux cannot be ignored. For example in Fig. 5.2(a), at Tsat = 5  ℃ the 
quality-average evaporation heat transfer coefficient at G = 400 kg/m2s is about 2700 
 90
suggest that the evaporation heat transfer is much better at the higher Tsat. 
Figures 5.6 and 5.7 further reveal the variations of the evaporation heat transfer 
coefficient with the inlet vapor quality of the refrigerant in the small tubes at an even 
higher imposed heat flux of 15 kW/m2 for different mass fluxes and refrigerant 
saturated temperatures. The data clearly indicate that the evaporation heat transfer 
coefficient also increases significantly with the refrigerant mass flux, saturated 
temperature and vapor quality. These trends are similar to those at the lower heat 
fluxes. Obviously, at different imposed heat fluxes the quantitative changes in hr with 
G and Tsat are somewhat different. For example, at q=15 kW/m2 and Tsat = 10  the ℃
quality-average evaporation heat transfer coefficients at G = 300 & 400 kg/m2s are 
respectively about 47 % and 86 % larger than that at G = 200 kg/m2s (Fig. 5.6(b)). 
And at q=15 kW/m2 and G = 400 kg/m2s the quality-average evaporation heat transfer 
coefficient at Tsat = 10 & 15  ℃ are respectively about 24 % and 49 % larger than that 
at Tsat = 5  (Fig. ℃ 5.7(c)). 
Next, results are presented in Figs. 5.8 to 5.10 to further illustrate the effects of 
the imposed heat flux on the R-407C evaporation heat transfer coefficient for the 
small circular tubes. These results clearly manifest that the increase of the evaporation 
heat transfer coefficient with the vapor quality is almost linear for all G, Tsat and q. 
Moreover, the increase is rather significant at the high G, Tsat and q. Note that at the 
lower heat flux there is lower nucleation density on the heating surface, lower bubble 
generation frequency, and slower bubble growth. Besides, at the lower mass flux we 
have lower vapor and liquid velocity. Thus, at low q and G the variations of the 
evaporation heat transfer coefficient with the vapor quality are less significant. 
Finally, the R-407C evaporation heat transfer coefficients measured here are 
compared with those from Yan and Lin [12] for R-134a in the same small tubes and 
 92
(Di = 6.5 mm). Specifically, the quality-average heat transfer coefficient given in Fig. 
5.12(a) is about 2700 W/m2  for T℃ sat = 5  in ℃ the small tubes and exceeds 1000 
W/m2  for T℃ sat = 2  in ℃ the large tube by 180 %. Similarly, for the lower mass flux 
the quality-average heat transfer coefficient given in Fig. 5.12(b) is about 2400 
W/m2  for T℃ sat = 5  in ℃ the small tubes and is also higher than 1200 W/m2  for T℃ sat 
= 2  in ℃ the large tube by 100 %. 
5-3 Correlation Equations 
For practical application the present data for the R-407C evaporation in the small 
tubes need to be correlated empirically. We first compare our data with those 
predicted from the correlations proposed by Bao et al. [13] and Liu and Winterton [49] 
in Fig. 5.13. The comparison indicate that the correlation from Liu and Winterton over 
predicted our data and about 50% of our data lie outside ±20% of the correlation of 
Bao et al. Then, the correlation proposed by Gungor and Winterton [50] is modified 
here to better fit our data. Their correlation is expressed as

                                             (5.4) 
where the hl is the single phase all liquid convection heat transfer coefficient 
evaluated from the Dittus-Boelter correlation, equation(5-1) and hpool is pool boiling 
heat transfer coefficient. Based on the present data hpool can be correlated as

the Martinelli parameter Xtt and the liquid Reynolds number Rel. The expressions for 
E and S are [50]

CHAPTER 6 
TWO-PHASE PRESSURE DROP 
IN SMALL CIRCULAR TUBES 
The measured data for the pressure drop of R-407C evaporation in the horizontal 
small circular tubes are presented in this chapter. Based on the estimation calculated 
from equations (3.15-3.17) the acceleration pressure drop and the pressure losses at 
the inlet and exit ports are rather small and the frictional pressure drop ranges from 94 
% to 97 % of the total pressure drop measured. In what follows the effects of the 
imposed heat flux, refrigerant mass flux and system pressure on the frictional pressure 
drop are examined in detail. Besides, the frictional pressure drops of R-407C 
evaporation in the horizontal small circular tubes are also compared with those of Yan 
and Lin [12] for R-134a and the proposed correlation of Tran et al. [26]. 
6-1 Two-Phase Frictional Pressure Drop 
The frictional pressure drops for the refrigerant R-407C evaporation in the small 
circular tubes under various flow and thermal conditions are presented in Figs. 6.1-6.9. 
First, Figs. 6.1-6.6 show the effects of the refrigerant mass flux and saturated 
temperature on the frictional pressure drop of the R-407C. The results in Figs. 6.1-6.6 
indicate that at a given mass flux the frictional pressure drop increases significantly 
with the inlet vapor quality. The increase is almost linear. In addition, the frictional 
pressure drop increase with the inlet vapor quality is larger for a higher mass flux. 
Moreover, a substantial increase in ΔPf results for the increase of the refrigerant mass 
flux. For instance in Fig. 6.1(c), at the high refrigerant mass flux of G = 400 kg/m2s 
the frictional pressure drop is about 60% and 200% on average higher than those for 
 110
6-2 Correlation Equations 
Correlation equations for the frictional pressure drop associated with the R-407C 
evaporation in the small circular tubes are important for thermal design of the 
evaporators in various air conditioning and refrigeration systems. Based on the 
present data, an empirical correlation for the dimensionless frictional pressure drop is 
proposed in terms of the friction factor. It is expressed as  
1.1251100 Retp eqf
−= ⋅  (6.1) 
where Reeq is the equivalent Reynolds number for the evaporating flow and is defined 
as

Here Geq is an equivalent mass flux which is a function of the R-407C mass flux, 
mean vapor quality and density at the test condition. Besides, inx  is the inlet vapor 
quality of the flow. Figure 6.12 shows that more than 63% of the present data for ftp 
fall within ±25% of Eq. (6-1), and the mean deviation between the present data for ftp 
and the proposed correlation is about 19%. 
6-3 Concluding Remarks 
Experimental measurement has been carried out here to investigate the frictional 
pressure drop of R-407C evaporation in the small circular tubes. Results for the 
frictional pressure drop have been examined in detail. The results reveal that the 
increase of the R-407C frictional pressure drop with the refrigerant vapor quality is

CHAPTER 7 
SATURATED FLOW BOILING OF R-407C and R-410A IN a 
HORIZONTAL NARROW ANNULAR DUCT 
 
In this chapter the measured heat transfer data and observed bubble characteristics for 
the saturated flow boiling of R-407C and R-410A in the narrow annular duct affected by 
the refrigerant mass flux, system pressure and duct size are presented. In the tests we have 
saturated liquid refrigerant at the inlet of the duct (xin = 0). The experiments are performed 
for the refrigerant mass flux varying from 500 to 600 kg/m2s, imposed heat flux q from 1 
to 45 kW/m2 and the system pressure set at 776 kPa and 900 kPa ( corresponding to the 
saturation temperature Tsat=10℃ and 15℃) for R-407C and set at 1100 kPa and 1250 kPa 
( corresponding to the saturation temperature Tsat=10℃ and 15℃) for R-410A, for the 
annular gap of the duct fixed at δ=1.0 mm. The measured boiling heat transfer data are 
expressed in terms of the boiling curves and boiling heat transfer coefficient. Moreover, the 
close view flow photos taken at a small region around the middle axial station z =80 mm 
are presented to illustrate the bubble characteristics in the boiling flow. 
7.1 Single-phase Heat Transfer 
Before beginning the two-phase flow boiling experiments, the single-phase 
convective heat transfer experiments are conducted for liquid R-407C and for liquid 
R-410A. The measured single-phase convection heat transfer coefficients are compared 
with the correlations proposed by Dittus-Boelter [47] and Gnielinski [48] for Rel > 2,300. 
In the single-phase heat transfer tests the refrigerant mass flux is varied from 300 to 1,050 
kg/m2s for the annular gap of the duct δ=1.0 mm, refrigerant saturate temperature Tsat=15
℃ and inlet liquid subcooling ΔTsub=3℃. Selected results from these tests are plotted in 
Figure 7.1.  
The Dittus-Boelter correlation is  
0.8 0.4
1 0.023 Re PrNu φ = ⋅ ⋅    for Re >104 (7.1) 
126 
mass flux. This is attributed to the fact that at a lower Tsat the surface tension and enthalpy 
of vaporization of R-407C is higher. At the higher surface tension and enthalpy of 
vaporization the liquid refrigerant is more difficult to completely flood the cavities, which 
in turn retards the bubbles to nucleate from the cavities on the heated surface. Note that 
 and  for the R-410A flow are less affected by the refrigerant mass flux and 
saturated temperature. Besides, at increasing refrigerant saturated temperature the boiling 
curves shift slightly to the left, which indicates that at a higher refrigerant saturated 
temperature the heat transfer in the saturated boiling is slightly better. No apparent 
temperature undershoot occurs during the onset of boiling of R-407C and R-410A when 
the flow is saturated. 
ONBTΔ ONBq
Then the effects of the refrigerants on the saturated flow boiling curves are shown in 
Figure 7.4. It is noted that the boiling curve shifts significantly to the left from R-134a to 
the R-407C and finally to R-410A indicating that the boiling heat transfer of R-410A is 
better than R-407C and R-407C boiling heat transfer is better than R-134a. It is also 
evident from the data that the required imposed heat flux and wall superheat for the boiling 
incipience is lowest for R-410A and highest for R-134a. 
7.3 Saturated Flow Boiling Heat Transfer Coefficient 
The effects of the refrigerant mass flux, refrigerant saturated temperature and 
refrigerants on the saturated flow boiling heat transfer at the middle axial location (z =80 
mm) in the narrow annular duct are shown in Figures 7.5-7.7 by presenting the saturated 
flow boiling heat transfer coefficient against the imposed heat flux for various G, Tsat and 
refrigerants. The results indicate that at given G and Tsat the saturated boiling heat transfer 
coefficient increases substantially with the imposed heat flux. This large increase in the 
saturated boiling heat transfer coefficient is ascribed to the higher active nucleation site 
density on the heating surface and higher bubble departure frequency for a higher imposed 
heat flux. The effects of the refrigerant mass flux on the saturated flow boiling heat transfer 
coefficient of R-407C and R-410A are insignificant, as shown in Figure 7.5. The effects of 
the refrigerant saturated temperature on the saturated flow boiling heat transfer coefficient 
of R-407C and R-410A shown in Figure 7.6 manifest that for R-410A increasing the  
saturated temperature results in higher saturated heat transfer coefficient at higher imposer 
heat flux. 
128 
the heated surface for R-410A is significantly more than R-407C and R-134a but the 
bubbles in R-410A flow is smaller than R-407C and R-134a due to its smaller surface 
tension force. As the imposed heat flux is increased to q=25 kW/m2, the active bubble 
nucleation density increases especially for R-410A and a lot more bubbles appear and they 
move faster. Many coalescence bubbles are seen as the heat flux is raised to q=35 kW/m2. 
The coalescence bubbles in the R-410A flow are bigger than R-407C and R-134a. 
To be more quantitative on the bubble characteristics, we move further to estimate the 
average bubble departure diameter and frequency and the average active bubble nucleation 
site density on the heating surface from the images of the boiling flow stored in the video 
tapes. The results from this estimation are examined in the following. The effects of the 
three parameters, namely, the refrigerant mass flux, refrigerant saturated temperature and 
refrigerants, on the mean bubble departure diameter for the saturated flow boiling at the 
middle axial location (z =80 mm) in the annular duct are shown in Figures 7.11-7.13 by 
presenting the average bubble departure diameter against the imposed heat flux for various 
G, Tsat and refrigerants. First, the effects of the refrigerant mass flux on the average bubble 
departure diameters for both R-407C and R-410A shown in Figure 7.11 indicate that the 
average departing bubble is only slightly larger for a lower refrigerant mass flux. The 
results in Figure 7.12 indicate that the average bubble departure diameter is smaller for a 
higher refrigerant saturated temperature. Then, the departing bubbles are substantially 
larger for R-134a, according to the data given in Figure 7.13. Moreover, the bubble 
departure diameter for R-407C is slightly larger than R-410A since R-407C has a higher 
surface tension. 
How the bubble departure frequency is affected by the three parameters for the 
saturated flow boiling at the middle axial location (z =80 mm) in the annular duct are 
shown in Figures 7.14-7.16 by presenting the average bubble departure frequency against 
the heat flux for various G, Tsat and refrigerants. Note that the increase of the bubble 
departure frequency with the imposed heat flux is rather significant for all cases presented 
here. First, the effects of the refrigerant mass flux on the saturated flow boiling average 
bubble departure frequency for both R-407C and R-410A are shown in Figures 7.14. The 
results indicate that the average bubble departure frequency is somewhat higher for a 
higher refrigerant mass flux especially at high imposed heat flux. The data given Figure 
7.15 indicate that the average bubble departure frequency is significantly higher for a 
130 
saturated temperature on the boiling heat transfer coefficient are small. 
(3). The results from the flow visualization show that the mean diameter of the bubbles 
departing from the heating surface decreases slightly with increasing refrigerant mass 
flux. Besides, at a high imposed heat flux many bubbles generated from the cavities in 
the heating surface tend to merge together to form big bubbles. The bubble departure 
frequency increases with the increasing refrigerant mass flux and saturated 
temperature. The active nucleation site density is much lower at a higher refrigerant 
mass flux and lower saturation temperature. The higher active nucleation site density 
on the heating surface for the R-410A flow is due to its smaller surface tension and is 
the main reason that the flow boiling heat transfer performance of R-410A is better 
than R-407C and R-134a.

CHAPTER 8 
CONCLUDING REMARKS  
 
8.1 Concluding Remarks 
First, we have carried out experiments to unravel the saturated flow boiling heat 
transfer characteristics and associated bubble characteristics of R-134a in a horizontal 
narrow annular duct. The effects of the refrigerant mass flux, imposed heat flux, and 
refrigerant saturated temperature have been examined in detail. A summary of the major 
findings from the present results is given in the following. 
(1).  The temperature undershoot at ONB are insignificant for the saturated flow boiling. 
(2). The saturated boiling heat transfer coefficient of R-134a is found to increase with a 
decrease in the gap size. Besides, raising the imposed heat flux can also cause a 
significant increase in the saturated flow boiling heat transfer coefficient. However, 
the effects of the refrigerant mass flux and saturated temperature on the boiling heat 
transfer coefficient are also small. 
(3). The results from the flow visualization of the bubble behavior in the saturated flow 
boiling show that the mean diameter of the bubbles departing from the heating surface 
decreases slightly at increasing refrigerant mass flux. Besides, at a high imposed heat 
flux many bubbles generated from the cavities in the heating surface tend to merge 
together to form a big bubbles. The mean bubble departure frequency is higher in the 
smaller duct. 
(4). Empirical correlations for the flow boiling heat transfer coefficients for R-134a in the 
narrow annular duct has been provided. Correlating equations have also been 
proposed for some bubble characteristics in the saturated boiling of R-134a in the 
narrow annular duct.  
Then, in the small circular tubes we have experimentally measured the heat transfer 
coefficient and pressure drop for the R-407C evaporation in the small circular tubes 
(Di=2mm). The influences of the refrigerant mass flux, heat flux, saturated temperature and 
vapor quality on the evaporation heat transfer and frictional pressure drop have been 
152 
the main reason that the flow boiling heat transfer performance of R-410A is better 
than R-407C and R-134a. 
Finally during the present study three articles have been published in the International 
Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer up to this point. They are included here for more 
detailed reference of the boiling of R-134a, R-407C and R-410A in small channels.
