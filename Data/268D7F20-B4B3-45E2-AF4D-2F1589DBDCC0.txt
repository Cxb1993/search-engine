（二）計畫英文摘要: 
Acceptance sampling plans provide the vendor and the buyer decision rules for lot 
sentencing to meet their product quality needs. A problem the quality practitioners have to deal 
with is the determination of the critical acceptance values and inspection sample sizes that 
provide the desired levels of protection to both vendors and buyers. As today’s modern quality 
improvement philosophy, reduction of variation from the target value is the guiding principle as 
well as reducing the fraction of defectives. The Cpm or Cpmk index adopts the concept of product 
loss, which distinguishes the product quality by setting increased penalty to products deviating 
from the target. In this study, a variables sampling plan based on Cpm (or Cpmk) index is proposed 
to handle processes requiring very low PPM fraction of defectives with process loss consideration. 
We develop an effective method for obtaining the required sample sizes n and the critical 
acceptance value C0 by solving simultaneously two nonlinear equations. Based on the designed 
sampling plan, the practitioners can determine the number of production items to be sampled for 
inspection and the corresponding critical acceptance value for lot sentencing.

OC curves for various AQLs for MIL-STD-414 sampling plan. Das and Mitra (1964) have 
investigated the effect of non-normality on the performance of the sampling plans. Bender (1975) 
considered sampling plans for assuring the percent defective in the case of the product quality 
characteristics obeying a normal distribution with unknown standard deviation, and presented a 
procedure using iterative computer program calculating the non-central t-distribution. 
Govindaraju and Soundararajan (1986) developed variables sampling plans that match the OC 
curves of MIL-STD-105D. Other researches related to the classical acceptance sampling plans 
include Wallis (1947, 1950), Jacobson (1949), Owen (1967), Guenther (1969), Kao (1971), 
Stephens (1978), Hamaker (1979), Hailey (1980), Odeh and Owen (1980, 1983), Hald (1981), 
Moskowitz and Tang (1992), Tagaras (1994), Suresh and Ramanathan (1997) and Arizono et al. 
(1997). In addition to the graphical procedure for designing sampling plans with specified OC 
curves, tabular procedures are also available for the same purpose. Duncan (1986) gave a good 
description of these techniques.  
Due to the sampling cannot guarantee that every defective item in a lot will be inspected, the 
sampling involves risks of not adequately reflecting the quality conditions of the lot. Such risk is 
even more significant as the rapid advancement of the manufacturing technology and stringent 
customers demand is enforced. Particularly, when the fraction of nonconforming products is 
required very low, such as measured in parts per million (PPM), the required number of 
inspection items must be very large in order to adequately reflecting the actual lot quality. As 
today’s modern quality improvement philosophy, reduction of variation from the target value is 
the guiding principle as well as reducing the fraction of nonconformities. The capability index 
pmkC  is constructed by combining the yield-based index pkC  and the loss-based index pmC , 
taking into account the process yield (meeting the manufacturing specifications) as well as the 
process loss (variation from the target).  Therefore, in this paper we propose the use of the pmkC  
capability index as a quality benchmark for an acceptance sampling scheme. The proposed 
sampling plan is developed based on analytical exact formulas hence the decisions made are 
reliable. 
2. Process Capability Indices Approach 
Process Capability Indices and Product Quality 
Process capability analysis has become an important and integrated part in the applications 
of statistical process control to continuous improvement of quality and productivity. The 
relationship between the actual process performance and the specification limits or tolerance may 
be quantified using appropriate process capability indices (PCIs). Based on analyzing the PCIs, a 
production department can trace and improve a poor process so that the quality level can be 
enhanced and the requirements of the customers can be satisfied. Several authors have promoted 
the use of various process capability indices and examined with different degrees of completeness 
(see Pearn et al., 1992, 1998; Kotz and Lovelace, 1998; Kotz and Johnson, 2002; Spiring et al., 
2003 for more details). Those indices have been defined explicitly as below, where μ  is the 
process mean, σ  is the process standard deviation, USL  and LSL  are the upper and lower 
specification limits, T  is the target value preset by customers or product designers, 
( ) / 2d USL LSL= −  is half of the length of the specification interval.

/n iiX X n== ∑  and 2 21( ) /nn iiS X X n== −∑  are the maximum likelihood estimators 
(MLEs) of μ  and 2σ , respectively. We note again that 2 2( )nS X T+ − 21( ) /n ii X T n== −∑  which 
is in the denominator of ˆ pmkC  is the uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator (UMVUE) 
of 2 2( )Tσ μ+ −  in the denominator of pmkC . In fact, the estimator of pmkC  can be expressed as 
ˆ ( ) /(3 )pmkC D H K H= − + , where 1/ 2 /D n d σ= , 2 2/nK ns σ= , 2 2( ) /H n x T σ= − , and 
1/ 2 /n Tη μ σ= − . Under the assumption of normality, K  is distributed as 2 1,nχ −  a chi-square 
distribution with 1n −  degrees of freedom, H  is distributed as 21, λχ′  a non-central chi-square 
distribution with one degree of freedom and the non-centrality parameter 2 2( ) /n Tλ μ σ= − , and 
H  is distributed as the normal distribution ( ,1)N η  with mean η  and variance 1.  That is, 
the estimator ˆ pmkC  is a mixture of the chi-square distribution and the non-central chi-square 
distribution, as expressed in the following (see Pearn et al., 1992):

Chen and Hsu (1995) investigated the asymptotic sampling distribution of the estimated 
pmkC  and showed that the estimator ˆ pmkC  is consistent, asymptotically unbiased estimator of 
pmkC , and if the fourth moment of the distribution of X  is finite, then ˆ pmkC  is asymptotically 
normal. Vännman and Kotz (1995) obtained the distribution of the estimated ( , )pC u v  for cases 
with T M= . By taking 1u =  and 1v = , the distribution of (1,1)p pmkC C=  can be obtained. 
Wright (1998) derived an explicit but rather complicated expression for the probability density 
function of the estimated pmkC . Using variables transformation and the integration technique 
similar to that presented in Vännman (1997), the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and the 
probability density function (PDF) of the estimated index ˆ pmkC  may be expressed alternatively 
in terms of a mixture of the chi-square distribution and the normal distribution. The explicit form 
of the CDF considerably simplify the complexity for analyzing the statistical properties of the 
estimated index, which can be expressed below (see Pearn and Lin, 2002):

1nχ − , with 1n −  degrees of freedom, ( )φ ⋅  is the PDF of the standard normal distribution 
(0,1)N , and it is noted that we would obtain an identical equation if we substitute ξ  by ξ−  
into (1) for fixed values of x  and n . Noting that for USLμ >  or LSLμ < , the capability 
0pmkC < , and for USLμ =  or LSLμ = , the capability pmkC = 0. The requirement with 
LSL USLμ< <  has been a minimum capability requirement applies to most start-up engineering 
applications or new processes. 
3. Designing Cpmk Variables Sampling Plans 
Consider an acceptance sampling plan by variables to control the lot fraction of 
nonconformities and assure the loss caused by the deviation from its target value simultaneously. 
Suppose the quality characteristic of interest is measurable on a continuous scale and is normally 
distributed with mean μ  and standard deviation σ , the USL and the LSL can be defined as the 
acceptable values of this parameter. According to today's modern quality improvement theory, 
reduction of the process loss is as important as the process yield, pmkC  can be used as a quality

Figs. 4(a)-4(b) display the surface and contour plots of (5) and (6) simultaneously with 
α -risk = 0.10 and β -risk = 0.05 under AQLC = 1.33 and LTPDC =1.00, respectively. From the Fig. 
4(b), we can see that the interaction of 1 0( , )S n C  and 2 0( , )S n C  contour curves at level 0 is 
0( , )n C = (82, 1.1870), which is the solution to nonlinear simultaneous equations (3) and (4). That 
is, in this case, the minimum required sample size n = 82 and the corresponding critical 
acceptance value 0C = 1.1870 of sampling plan based on the capability index pmkC .

To investigate the behavior of the critical acceptance values and the required sample sizes 
with various parameters, we perform extensive calculations to obtain the solution of (3) and (4). 
We observe that the larger of the risks which producer or consumer could suffer, the smaller is the 
required sample size n . This phenomenon can be explained intuitively: if we expect that the 
chance of wrongly concluding a bad process as good or good lots as bad ones is smaller, the more 
sample information need to judge the lots. Further, for fixed α , β  risks and LTPDC , the 
required sample sizes become smaller when the AQLC  becomes larger. This can also be 
explained by the same reasoning as above, since the judgment will be more accurate with a larger
