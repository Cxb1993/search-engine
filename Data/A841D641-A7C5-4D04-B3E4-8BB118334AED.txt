Abstract 
We determined content of radiocesium 
( 137Cs) and alkali metals in soils, plants (2 ferns, 
a shrub and moss) and rainwater in an 
undisturbed forest ecosystem. The 137Cs activity 
and the isotopic ratio of 137Cs/Cs in the samples 
were used to interpret the distribution and 
uptake of 137Cs and the alkali metals in plants. 
As a whole, the 137Cs in plants was assimilated 
together with K but was not dependent on Cs. 
Different adaptations of fern species in 
ecological niches causes them to have different 
137Cs/Cs ratios. Diplopterygium glaucum is 
distributed at the edges of the forest, which 
usually has shallow organic layers, and the root 
takes up more stable Cs from mineral layers, 
leading to lower 137Cs/Cs ratios than that in the 
understory Plagiogyria formosana and 
Rhododendron formosanum species. The steady 
supply of stable Cs through the uptake by D. 
glaucum from deep soils may gradually dilute 
the 137Cs concentration and thus explain the 
lower 137Cs/Cs ratio in the biological samples. 
The 137Cs is predicted to be proportional to Cs 
content across plant species in the biological 
cycle once isotopic equilibrium is attained.

1. Introduction 
Among the alkali metals, stable Cs, with 
identical chemical behavior to 137Cs, has been 
widely investigated for understanding the 
distribution of 137Cs in various environmental 
systems, such as soil-to-plant transfer for crops, 
identification of the 137Cs transport and 
environment fate modeling.  Stable Cs usually 
provides a useful analogy for observing 
long-term variation and transfer parameters of 
137Cs in a specific environment and/or 
ecosystem. Comparatively few studies have 
been conducted to clarify the influence of alkali 
metals on 137Cs distribution and cycling 
processes in a forest ecosystem. Previous 
studies revealed that relatively little 137Cs is 
fixed by the clay minerals, which increases the 
availability for plant uptake, leading to high 
soil-to-plant transfer factors in the organic soils 
of perhumid montane forest. Under such 
situations, a certain amount of 137Cs is 
considered to be retained and recycled in the 
forest system. In this study, we continued to 
survey the distribution of 137Cs in the perhumid 
montane forest system by investigating the 
relation between content of 137Cs and alkali 
metals, including K, Rb and Cs, in the 
environment. The isotopic ratio of 137Cs/Cs was 
used to predict the distribution and uptake

3. Results and Discussion 
3.1 137Cs and 137Cs/Cs in soils 
Content of 137Cs and stable Cs and the 
137Cs/Cs ratio were correlated with C in soils. 
137Cs seemed to be maintained at a constant 
level, of approximately 40 Bq·kg-1, except in 
soils with low C ( < 200 mg.g-1 ). However, Cs 
content was negatively correlated with C in 
soils?it decreased with increasing C, which 
indicates that stable Cs is more abundant in soil 
minerals than in organic matter. The positive 
relation between 137Cs/Cs ratio and C reveals 
that most of 137Cs existed in soil layers with 
high organic matter.  
To understand more about the 137Cs 
distribution in soils, we determined 137Cs 
activity and 137Cs/Cs ratio in soil horizons along 
topographical locations in the forest. Most of 
the 137Cs was concentrated in the Oi and Oe 
layers, whereas stable Cs, as well as K and Rb, 
increased in level with depth and reached a 
constant level in the E and B layers, seeming to 
be inversely related to the C in the layers. 
Therefore, the 137Cs/Cs ratio was highest in the 
Oi layers and decreased with depth, which 
suggests that most 137Cs in soils is actively 
recycled in the upper layers of the forest 
ecosystem, because 137Cs can be supplied 
efficiently through the decomposition of 
litterfall.  
The 137Cs/Cs ratios in the Oi and Oe layers 
ranged from 26?10-10 to 237?10-10, 
approximating those of the growing plants 
(Table 1). The isotopic equilibrium between 
137Cs and Cs in the ecosystem depends on the 
biological cycle between plants and the soil 
layers of Oi, Oe, and E. The 137Cs in soils with 
high organic matter exhibits high capacity for 
exchange and is readily available for plant 
uptake, thus differing from the 137Cs fixed by 
minerals. On release from the decomposed 
organic matter, 137Cs exchanges with stable Cs 
in the soils with high organic matter, and 
gradually an isotopic equilibrium is reached 
between them.  
3.2 137Cs and alkali metals in plants 
The concentrations of the alkali metals are 
in the order of K > Rb > Cs for the four species 
studied, being confined to a certain range for 
each species. The K, Cs and Rb content in the 
plants seems to be positively associated across 
plant species. This finding is consistent with 
results of studies showing similarity of the 
alkali metals in chemical behavior for plant 
uptake. Distribution of 137Cs (17.7?44.3 
Bg.kg-1) seemed to be relatively uniform arcoss 
the plant species, but K (2970?11400 µg.g-1), 
Rb (10.4?75.5 µg.g-1) and Cs (0.56?3.31 
µg.g-1) concentrations had wider ranges. The 
order of concentration of K, Rb, and Cs was D. 
glaucum > P. formosana > R. formosanum > 
moss, whereas that of 137Cs was P. formosana > 
R. formosanum > D. glaucum > moss. Of note, 
D. glaucum accumulated more Rb and Cs than 
other plants, whereas its uptake for 137Cs was 
less than that predicted. The highest 137Cs/Cs 
ratio was for P. formosana (119) and the lowest 
for D. glaucum (18.7). The 137Cs/Cs ratios 
ranging from 96.4?10-10 to 119?10-10 for P. 
formosana, R. formosanum and moss are close 
to those of the soil layers Oi and Oe. In these 
layers, most of 137Cs and stable Cs can be 
biologically available for these plants. 
3.3 Relation of K and 137Cs in plants  
Regardless of variation in K level in soils, 
that in plants is usually maintained at a constant 
 -5-
plants (18.7?119?10-10). 
3.5 Transfer factors of 137Cs and stable Cs in 
plants 
Table 2 shows for the plant species 
(except for moss) the TFs of the alkali metals 
and 137Cs, which is based on the assumption that 
the root zone of all plants in soils is within 
10cm. All the TFs for K, Rb and Cs are in the 
order of D.glaucum > P. formosana > R. 
forosanum. For D. glaucum, the transfer factor 
for Cs is almost the same as that for 137Cs, 
which indicates that plant root zone is evenly 
distributed in the whole soils we collected. For 
P. formosana and R. formosanum, the TF for of 
137Cs is relatively higher than that for Cs; their 
roots are predicted to distribute mostly in the 
upper soils (O, A, E layers). The contribution of 
137Cs and Cs to plant uptake is related to the soil 
layers where the root distributes. The difference 
might be associated with the characteristics of 
plants, because D. glaucum is distributed mostly 
at the edge of the forest, which lacks soil 
organic matter and the root zone is basically in 
mineral layers. By contrast, P. formosana and R. 
formosanum are understory plants, and the root 
zone covers organic to mineral layers. 
4. Conclusions 
The 137Cs in soils is concentrated in the Oi 
and Oe layers of the montane forest ecosystem 
we studied. The respective 137Cs/Cs ratio 
positively correlates with C and decreases with 
depth in soils. Most 137Cs distributed in the 
ecosystem seems to be recycled in surface 
organic layers and plants, as evidenced by the 
137Cs/Cs ratios among the plants we studied 
being close to that in surface organic layers. The 
uptake of the alkali metals are in the order of K 
> Rb > Cs for the four plants species studied 
and are positively related across plant species. 
D. glaucum showed the highest uptake of the 
alkali metals among all plant species but the 
lowest 137Cs/Cs ratio.  
The concentration of 137Cs is 
approximately constant among plant species and 
seemed to be assimilated together with K. In 
contrast, the uptake of Cs was not consistent 
with that of 137Cs. The persistent input of stable 
Cs from the weathering processes of minerals in 
deeper soil layers through uptake by D. 
glaucum consequently reduces the uptake of 
137Cs and the corresponding 137Cs/Cs ratio in the 
biological cycle. The level of Rb is between that 
of K and Cs in relation to 137Cs uptake for 
plants. The 137Cs/Cs ratio can be an indicator for 
monitoring the distribution and uptake of 137Cs 
in the forest ecosystem. The 137Cs/Cs ratio in 
the plants will approach a constant once the 
equilibrium between 137Cs and Cs in the 
biological cycle is attained.
