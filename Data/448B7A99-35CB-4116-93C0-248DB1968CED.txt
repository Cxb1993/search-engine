Abstract.  
  The Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks with the fake source IP addresses became a major 
threat to the Internet. Intrusion detection system is often used to detect DoS attacks. However, 
DoS attack packets attempt to exhaust resources, degrading network performance or, even 
worse, causing network breakdown. The proposed proactive approach is allocating the 
original attack host(s) issuing the attacks and stopping the malicious traffic, instead of 
wasting resources on the attack traffic.  
  Ant colony based traceback approach is presented in this study to identify the DoS attack 
original source IP address. Instead of creating a new function or processing a high volume of 
fine-grained data, the proposed IP address traceback approach uses flow level information to 
identify the origin of a DoS attack.  
  The proposed method is evaluated through simulation on various network environments. 
The simulation results show that the proposed method can successfully and efficiently find 
the DoS attack path in various simulated network environments.

Introduction1 
  According to a study conducted by the Computer Security Institute in 2003 [1], 90 percent of 
the 530 surveyed companies had detected computer security breaches in 2003. The same study 
found that 74 percent acknowledged financial losses due to these security breaches. Although 
only 47 percent were able to quantify their losses, the financial losses reported by 251 
respondents totaled more than $202 million US dollars. However, it is just a proverbial tip of the 
iceberg. Furthermore, according to the statistics of Dollar Amount of Losses by Type [1], the 
denial of service (DoS) attack is the second most expensive computer crime among survey 
respondents with the cost of more than 65 million US dollars. 
  Nowadays, many organizations use firewall and Instruction Detection System (IDS) to secure 
their network. If the attacker conducts a DoS attack with a large amount of traffic, the network 
would still be tied up. Most work in this area has focused on tolerating attacks by mitigation their 
effects on the victim. Such passive approach can provide an effective stopgap measure, but does 
not eliminate the problem or does it discourages the attackers. 
  The proactive approach is to find the source of the DoS attack and to cooperate with the 
internet service provider (ISP) or the network administrators stopping the traffic from the origin. 
Hence, it can restore normal network functionality, preventing reoccurrences and, ultimately, 
holding the attackers accountable. However, many network-based DoS attacks use the flaw of 
TCP/IP to manipulate and falsify the source address in the IP header. Conventional trace methods 
might not be able to identify the origin as the source address could be spoofed. 
  The goal of this work is to propose an IP traceback approach to finding out the origin of the

  While exploring the network, the each ant keeps track of the path and the number of DoS 
flows. The above procedure is repeated tracing back to the upstream routers until the ant reaches 
a boundary router of the monitored network. 
  The intensity of pheromone trail is revised after all the ants complete their route from the 
victim to a boundary router. The path information obtained by each ant is used to

all the ants, expressed below.

  where )1,( +Δ ttkiτ  is the quantity per unit of length of pheromone laid on router i by the k-th 
ant between time t and t+n, so the more ants pass through the edge, the more pheromone will be 
laid on edge. The change of pheromone results in positive feedback -- the more ants are following 
a path, the more attractive that path becomes for being follow. 
  The intensity of pheromone on router i can be revised once Δτi(t,t+1) is obtained and is 
formulated as below.

  where ρ  is a coefficient such that (1- ρ ) represents the evaporation of pheromone. 
  Each time when all ants complete one iteration (cycle), the intensity of pheromone on each 
router will be recalculated based on the above equation. Following the above illustration shown 
in Figure 1, there would be more pheromone accumulated on Router 7 which results in attracting 
more ants on Router 4 to choose Router 7 in the following iterations, as Router 7 is on the DoS 
attack path.

  The flow management component collects the flow based attributes. The open-source tools, 
Scientific Linux [9], flow-tools [10], STREAM [11], are adopted in this research to achieve the 
above NetFlow management purpose.  
  The proposed IP traceback scheme is based on ant algorithm and use NetFlow logs to simulate 
the IP traceback process. Using artificial ants to explore the network and collect information 
about the denial-of-service attacks to forecast the possible attack path and traceback to the origin 
of the DoS attack. 
Experimental Results 
  A simulated network environment, illustrated in Figure 4, deployed by VMware Workstation 
[12]. Zebra [13], a routing freeware managing TCP/IP based routing protocol, is adpoted to 
simulate the routers in the experimental environment running on FreeBSD. 
  Once the DoS flows are identified, the flow management component can find out the octets 
sent by the DoS flows with the source address in the suspected source address list. The finding 
then will be fed to the traceback component to find the DoS attack path.  
  The results of the traceback are shown in the following figures presented in three dimensional 
graphs, where the x-axis represents the path discovered by ants, the y-axis represents the number 
of iterations, and the z-axis represents the number of ants in y-th cycle found x-th path. The 
attack path found by the proposed ant colony based traceback method is the one with the most 
ants. 
  Figure 6 shows the results of the traceback with full flow information provided by the network. 
The proposed traceback method explores all the possible attack paths in the initial stage of 
traceback and the ants would tend to converge to the attack path in the following iterations. After 
about half of the simulation, most ants will converge on the DoS attack path. 
  According to the results of the preliminary experiment, we verify that the proposed solution 
can find out the DoS attack path in case all the routers in the network provide flow information. 
However, in real environments, some flow information might be lost, especially at the router on 
the DoS attack path. Other experimental results are eliminated due to the length of the paper, but 
they all conclude that the proposed solution can find the DoS path efficiently and correctly.

Conclusion 
  DoS attack becomes one of the major threats in the Internet and causes massive revenue loss of 
many companies. However, DoS attacks often associate with spoofed source addresses, making 
them hard to identify the attacker. A proactive approach to DoS attacks are finding the original 
machine which issues the attack and stopping the malicious traffic.  
  In this research, the traceback based on ant colony is proposed to identify the DoS attack 
origin. Unlike the previous traceback schemes, such as packet marketing and logging, which use 
packet level information, the proposed traceback approach use flow level information. Although
