Introduction 
In the wind engineering application, the importance of bridge flutter is well recognized 
because it could potentially cause devastating failure in structures.  A typical example is the 
collapse of Tacoma Narrows suspension bridge in 1940, which occurred under mild exposure of 
wind speed in only 20 meters per second.  The phenomenon of flutter in bridges belongs to a 
category of wind-structure interaction, i. e., the so-called aero-elasticity.  It is generated by the 
mechanism in which the flow surrounding the bridge section, which is considerably altered by 
significant bridge responses at the previous time instant, changes the force pattern acting on the 
bridge deck at the next time instant, and this process goes on and on in the subsequent time.  
Starting from few decades earlier, noticeable attention has been drawn to many researchers for 
pertinent investigation of the cause of bridge flutter through either theoretical or experimental 
approach, among which the most important advances in terms of theoretical modeling was 
initiated by Scanlan et al. (1971) by introducing the idea of flutter derivatives.  Flutter 
derivatives were originally used in aerospace engineering for predicting the flutter wind speed of 
airfoils.  They are linked to the self-excited forces induced by wind, and expressed as functions 
of reduced wind velocity (sometimes reduced frequency is used instead).  For a perfect flat plate 
in laminar flow, the flutter derivatives render solutions in the theoretical forms which can be 
denoted in terms of Theodorsen functions (Jain et al. (1996)).  However, due to the bluff body 
nature of bridge decks in civil infrastructures, the flutter derivatives of bridges can only be 
determined by the results directly from wind tunnel tests on the bridge section models.   
So far, many practical problems in regard to bridge flutter can be fairly solved with the aid 
of wind tunnel tests.  The methodology in the conventional approach for wind tunnel tests 
basically uses the free vibration technique that had been well developed and widely used in the 
practical applications to date.  Nevertheless, the typical shortcomings out of it include: (1) the 
lack of consistency in the measured data due to high sensitivity of free vibration responses to test 
condition and/or environment (especially in high wind velocity condition which result in more 
significant wind-structure interaction); (2) The free vibration responses are sometimes influenced 
by the vortex shedding effect at low reduced wind velocity; (3) the discrepancy inherently 
inherited by treating the free vibration frequency as the forced vibration frequency; and 
accordingly (4) the range of the reduced wind velocity is frequently restricted due to the practical 
limit on the model frequency and the wind velocity which is essentially confined by the wind 
tunnel capacity.  The issues related to the point (3) will be discussed in detail in the Part II paper 
after comprehension of the theory described in this Part I paper.. 
 in a way that the elastic center coincides with the mass center, i. e., no eccentricity is present.  
Under both of smooth wind flow and the indirect forced actuation from the actuating device, the 
equations of motion in heaving (vertical) and pitching (torsional) directions can be expressed as

Realization of Motion-Induced Force and Moment by Equivalent Linear Dynamics  
Conceptually, the motion-induced force  and moment  per unit length are 
related to structural responses.  By introducing the idea of flutter derivatives [Scanlan et al. 
(1971), Scanlan (1993)], they can be expressed as

proposed identification scheme (see later sections).  Similar representations can be also applied 
to ,  and  except that the subscript ‘Mθ’ in sbi 'L/hH L/θH M/hH should be replaced by ‘Lh’, 
‘Lθ’ and ‘Mh’ accordingly.  Note that the same denominator with coefficients ia  should be 
used in that physically the pitching and heaving motions are characterized by a common 
mechanism in which a set of common poles will be preserved in each frequency force function 
(i.e., common roots in their denominators).  In other words, all frequency force functions shall 
share the same coefficients ia .  To avoid duplication in the formulation in the rest of the section, 
the derivation will specifically focus on the frequency force function  (Eqs. (10)-(13)).  
The derivations for others can be made in the same manner.  A list of differences in notation for

To make the realization in Eq. (10) physically correct, the following two restrictions have to be 
imposed: (i) all the roots  of the polynomial in the denominator of Eq. (10) should have

(ii) the order of the numerator should be larger than that of the denominator (i. e., n>m) based on 
physical interpretation of force/displacement, and therefore it is conceivable to choose n = m+1 
for simplicity.  Hence, Eq. (10) can be further rewritten in quotient and residue as

 Because of the uncoupling in two directions, the following derivation will only focus on the 
pitching response  to avoid duplication in the formulation.  The derivation for the heaving 
response  can be made in the same manner following the subscript change as listed in 
Table 1.  With the substitution of  in Eq. (13), the aero-elastic frequency response

Although the expressions in Eqs. (21) and (32) are theoretically identical, the appreciable 
advantage of introducing the aero-elastically incorporated state equations for deriving the 
aero-elastic frequency response function  is stated as follows.  When the coefficients 
0θ/θH
 Mθib ,ia ’s and ’s are obtained following the minimization procedures (see the next section), the 
aero-elastically incorporated state equation (28) can be directly used to facilitate the time domain 
analysis of the aero-elastic pitching responses (  and θ ) under buffeting moment disturbance 
by simply replacing  by the buffeting moment.  This analogy can be easily observed when 
the indirect forced actuation  in Eq. (2) is replaced by the buffeting 
moment as the external loading.  This is also the advantage of using indirect forced actuation 
approach over the direct forced vibration method.

the aero-elastic frequency response function  subjected to smooth wind flow of various 
mean velocities while the indirect forced actuation  is imposed, the unknown coefficients can 
be determined properly by minimizing a performance index that consists of the sum of weighted

of coupled aero-elastic equations is obtained and the resultant aero-elastic frequency response 
functions can be solved as

to obtain more accurate results of flutter derivatives in the range of higher reduced wind speed.

Prediction of Critical Flutter Speed 
sbi 'Given all the identified coefficients of  and sai '  for the perfect flat plate, the critical 
flutter speed can be predicted by evaluating the wind velocity at which the real parts of the 
eigenvalues of the system matrix  in Eq. (40) (or (44)) just turn from negative to positive.  
The predicted critical flutter speed in the present configuration was found to be at 10.6863 m/sec.  
At this critical speed, the frequency response functions ,  and  induced by the 
indirect forced actuation can be predicted by following the same formulas.  Their plots were 
shown in Fig. 7 by the dotted black curves.  The comparison with the simulated frequency 
response functions ,  and  (Eq. (35)), which was denoted in Fig. 6 by the 
dotted black curves, shows that they are in a remarkable agreement.  This means that the 
identified coefficients of

sbi ' and sai '  for extrapolating the wind velocity to predict the critical 
flutter speed is feasible.  As also shown in Fig. 6 and 7 by the increase of the wind velocity, it is 
obvious to demonstrate that, when the flutter speed occurs, the perfect flat plate model will 
eventually oscillate in a single mode frequency which is shifted from the torsional frequency of 
the original structure.

across-wind effect, in particular the theoretical link with experimental data, are still remain 
challenging.  It is well recognized that the resonance and lock-in effect in the across-wind 
motion of high-rise buildings should be mostly avoided, which initiate many researches that 
mainly focus on the response before the lock-in stage (e.g., Bearman and Grahm, 1980, Vickery 
and Steckley, 1993, etc.).  However, to better understand the behavior of across-wind 
resonance and lock-in, this study aimed at investigating its mechanism by adopting conceivable 
theoretical models to identify the aerodynamic parameters (such as aerodynamic damping and 
stiffness) through wind tunnel tests.   
Firstly, the analytical solution near lock-in was derived according to an existent literature 
(Ehsan and Scanlan, 1989), and it showed that the aerodynamic parameters (including linear and 
nonlinear aerodynamic dampings Y1 and ε and aerodynamic stiffness Y2) are not only functions 
of the section shape and reduced wind velocity but also dependent on both the mass ratio (mr) 
and structural damping (ξ) independently, instead of only on the Scruton number (= ξ / mr ) as a 
whole.  Following the literature, the growth-to-resonance (GTR) and decay-to-resonance (DTR) 
methods were further derived from the analytical solution and the GTR method was used for 
identifying aerodynamic parameters.  To improve the accuracy of the results, the optimization 
of the curve-fitting for experimental and analytical response in time domain by using the 
previously identified values as the initial guess will be performed to finalize the results.  
 Three different section models were used in the wind tunnel tests for identification, which 
are one square section (BD=1) and two rectangular sections (BD=1/2 and BD=1/3).  The data 
base of the aerodynamic parameters obtained can be used as useful guidance for practical 
applications 
II. FORMULATION 
2.1 Equation of Motion for Lock-in Behavior of Section Models 
The across-wind motion of a section model, as shown in Fig. 1, can be expressed as 
),,,,()2( 211 tUyyyFyyym &&&&&& =ω+ξω+  (1) 
in which  is the mass per unit length; m 1ω  is the structural frequency;  is the structural 
damping ratio;  is the across-wind structural displacement; is the motion-induced force 
per unit length; U is the mean wind velocity.  The motion-induced force by vortex shedding 
near lock-in is a self-limiting force which according to (Ehsan and Scanlan, 1989) can be written 
as a nonlinearly interacted force as follows 
ξ
y F
 
  
    The observation from the existent experiments show that the vortex shedding force is 
relatively trivial in comparison to the motion-induced force as structural responses become 
significantly large near lock-in.  Therefore, Eq. (4) can be simplified as

2.2 Analytical Solution 
 Firstly, let’s rewrite Eq. (5) as  
     (6) ),(1

in which

It can be assumed that the solution has the form of  
)](cos[)()( sψKssAsη −=   (8) 
, that is, the solution is a harmonic function with a slowly varying amplitude and phase.  In 
other words, it is a so-called quasi-linear system.  Since this expression of the solution involves 
two unknowns  and )(sA )(sψ , an additional condition as used by (Van der Pol, 1920) can be 
used as the supplement in the solution procedure, i.e.,  
0)](sin[)()()](cos[)( =−′+−′ sψKssψ sAsψKssA   (9) 
The meaning underlying Eq. (9) is that  and )(sA )(sψ  are considered to be constant while 
making the derivative on .  Based on Eqs. (6)-(9), the coupled 1)(sη st order differential 
equations for  and )(sA )(sψ  can be derived as  
{ )](sin[)](cos[))((),(1)( 2121 sψKssψKsKKsAηηFKsA −−−+′−=′ }  (10)

    By using the quasi-linear assumption, i.e., the amplitude  and phase )(sA )(sψ  vary very 
little, the derivative )(sA′  and )(sψ ′  can be treated as constants within any cyclic period 
Kπ2 .  Therefore, by combining with the change of variable ψKsp −= , the right-hand side 
of Eqs. (10) and (11) can be conceivably replaced by the average of their values in one cycle 
period 2π, i.e.,

In other words, β  is actually the final steady-state amplitude. 
 
2.3 Identification Scheme of Aerodynamic Parameters 
According to Eq. (20), when the bluff body lock-in occurs, an initial amplitude will finally 
lead to a steady-state amplitude  as time goes by.  Depending on the magnitude of the initial 
amplitude is larger or smaller than , the identification scheme by employing such a decaying 
or growing process are called Decay-to-Resonance (DTR) method (see Fig. 2(a)) or 
Grow-to-Resonance (GTR) method (see Fig.2 (b)), respectively.  Based on the experiments 
normally observed as shown in Fig. 2, it takes longer time to get to the steady-state response in 
the GTR case than in the DTR case.  The identification scheme is described in the following.

2.4 Improvement of the Results by Optimization 
To further improve the accuracy of the identified parameters ,  and , these three 
values are used as the initial guesses to an optimization problem that curve-fits the experimental 
response time histories and the theoretical formula in Eq. (20).  The performance index

Each test was performed twice to three times for increasing experimental reliability before 
the identification scheme was processed accordingly. To ensure the consistency of the test 
results, the mixed use of the GTR and DTR methods was avoided and thus only the GTR 
method was adopted as the identification scheme.  The across-wind steady-state amplitude of 
the three section models versus the reduced wind velocity near the lock-in stage was plotted in 
Fig. 4.  As shown in Fig. 4, the steady-state amplitude has the trend of increasing with the 
reduced wind velocity (U/f1D=2π/K1) for all sections, while the tail part slightly reverses for the 
sections BD1 and BD1/3.  Notice that the inverse of the reduced wind velocity should be close 
to the corresponding Strouhal number.

also shown in Fig. 5 by the solid curves denoted by “Regressive Curve”.  The comparison plots 
of these aerodynamic parameters were shown in Fig. 6. 
As shown from Figs. 5 and 6, the following observations can be made.  In the case of 
Model [BD1, mr=0.005165, ξ=0.18%], all three parameters decrease as the reduced wind 
velocity increases. The results of Model [BD1/2, mr =0.010005, ξ=0.16%] show that  and 
 are almost a constant around the value of 1 to 2 with the reduced velocity, while ε  
indicates a decaying distribution versus the reduced velocity.  As for Model [BD1/3, m

reduced velocity, while the other two show the trends of decreasing with the reduced velocity.

V. CONCLUSIONS  
From the analytical solution, it was shown that the aerodynamic parameters are not only 
functions of the section shape and reduced wind velocity but also dependent on both the mass 
ratio (mr) and structural damping (ξ) independently, instead of only on the Scruton number as a 
whole.  The across-wind aerodynamic parameters of three section models (BD=1, BD=1/2 and 
BD=1/3) near the lock-in stage have been successfully identified using the GTR method based 
on wind tunnel measurements.  To improve the accuracy of the results, the optimization of the 
curve-fitting for experimental and analytical response in time domain was performed to finalize 
the results.  Near the lock-in stage, the across-wind steady-state amplitude has the trend of 
increasing with the reduced wind velocity for all sections, while the tail part slightly reverses for 
the sections BD1 and BD1/3.  For the BD1 section, all the aerodynamic parameters decrease as 
the reduced wind velocity increases.  The results of the section BD1/2 show that  and  
are almost a constant around the value of 1 to 2 with the reduced velocity, while  indicates a 
decaying distribution versus the reduced velocity.  For the section BD1/3, the parameter  has 
a distribution of concave-up polynomial versus the reduced velocity, while the other two show 
the trends of decreasing with the reduced velocity.
