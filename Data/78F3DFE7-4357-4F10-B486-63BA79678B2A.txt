水生植物對明渠流速分佈之影響 
 
摘要 
 
植物在渠道中具有消能或阻礙水流的功用。然而植物也可以穩定渠道邊坡與渠
床。近年來植栽渠道被應用於改善地表水汙染、降低沉滓與復育河溪沼澤環境。流速
分布是明渠流中最為重要的因素，在植栽頂蓋上方的流速分布常利用對數流速分布理
論，植栽頂蓋下方的流速分布則常用指數或冪流速分布理論。然而對數、指數和冪流
速理論並不能完整的應用於植栽渠道流速分布。在本研究中提出一個基於機率理論的
植栽渠道流速分布理論。一系列的水生植栽渠道實驗也同時進行，其實驗結果應用於
植栽渠道流速分布理論，以證實新提出植栽渠道流速分布理論的正確性。

the relationship between u and y is not one to one and the velocity can be found at two 
different locations.  The other disadvantage of the logarithmic law is that the shear velocity 
at the channel bed is infinite.  In addition, the settings and conditions of past studies on 
velocity distribution in vegetated channels were mostly based on grassed trenches of 
highway drainage and/or terrestrial plants of flood plain.  These conditions, however, not 
perennially moist or watery enough but yet stable for terrestrial plants, are not quite the 
same as stream ecosystems with constant water and aquatic plants.  Aquatic plants must 
against greater external forces than terrestrial plants because the density of water is higher 
than the density of air.  Thus, these plants develop into forms that are more streamline in 
shape and have flexible stems.  Also the buoyancy in water makes completely submerged 
aquatic plants have less dead weight.  For these reasons, genuine aquatic plants are used in 
this study to simulate vegetated channels in nature for the purpose of estimating velocity 
distribution and develop a probabilistic velocity distribution equation. This is used to 
enhance the accuracy and replace the complicated model of the past. 
 
2. Velocity distribution in vegetated channels 
To derive an alternative velocity distribution model that does not have the weaknesses 
or limitations of the logarithmic equation is needed.  Chiu (1988, 1989) derived the 
following velocity distribution:

 (1) 
Where u is velocity on an isovel of a ξ  as shown in Figure. 1; (Chiu 1988) umax is 
maximum velocity; M is parameter; 0ξ  is the minimum value of ξ  at which u=0; 
and maxξ is the maximum value ofξ  at which umax occurs.  The ηξ −  coordinate system 
can describe the velocity distribution by a set of isovels (ξ ), and allows the relation of u 
and ξ  to be one to one.  The set of isovels ξ  along the y-axis, which is the vertical with 
maximum velocity in the cross-section, is

Where D is the water depth, and h indicates the location of umax.  When umax 
occurred bellowing water surface h unit, h>0.  If 0≤h , umax occurs on the water surface.  
Based upon the concept of probability, the probability of velocity less than u is the 
area of the isovel between ξ and 0ξ divided by the total area.

Where the p(u) is density function.  By the method of Lagrange multipliers, maxuu  
can be derived as following function of M: 
  
As shown in Figure 2, the velocity distribution in a vegetated channel is divided into 3 
zones by two relative depths D1 and D2 (Carollo et al. 2002).

Where the hl is the bent vegetation height.  The relative depth values of zone 1, flow 
inside vegetation and closest to the channel bed, is y<D1.  The flow field in zone 1 is 
complex and the velocities are very small and increase with depth.  Zone 2, a transition 
zone, is the interface layer between zone 1 and zone 3 that the velocity increases rapidly and

2.3 Velocity Distribution in Zone 2 
 Owing to the rapid increase of velocity, the shape of the velocity distribution inflects in 
Zone 2.  The maximum turbulence intensity also occurs in the area of bent vegetation 
height (Ikeda and Kanazawa 1996).  Thus Zone 2’s flow condition becomes too 
complicated and various to simulate the velocity distribution mechanically or 
mathematically.  Instead, a linear velocity distribution (Quraishi and Abou-Seida 1975) or 
a logarithm velocity distribution is suggested for this transition region.  In this study, Zone 
2’s velocity distribution is calculated by equalizing the estimated velocity distributions of 
Zone 1 and Zone 3, as shown in Figure 3.

location due to high velocity rapids.  The flow conditions of swells, at the height of unsteady flow that both 
water level and flow change drastically, must be measured instantly and immediately to seize the accuracy.  
However, under the difficult conditions of high flow, mostly during typhoon invasions, both hydrologists and 
measuring instruments will be in danger of rapid flow disasters.  Not to mention the cost and labor, it is 
highly unlikely and impossible to simultaneously obtain the velocity and cross-section area of a river.

Using conventional methods and equipments to measure during swells costs more time, thus prolongs 
hydrologists’ time of exposure to danger, and complicates the process of obtaining accurate flow data.  
Hence, a simple, fast, reliable and accurate flow measurement method for high flow use must be developed. 
2 MODERNIZED MEASURING INSTRUMENT 
There are several types of flow measuring instruments with advantages and disadvantages or confined 
within certain limits of usages.  Selecting and applying measuring instruments to precisely measure flows 
during swells vary according to the gauge station’s flow field and terrene.  Several different types of 
instruments are tested in this study during high flow to collect flow field data, and the data analysis indicates 
that the refined Mini ADP of SonTek 1500 kHz coheres with the hydrological characteristics of the Nanshi 
River and is sufficient to collect the velocity and cross section data.  In addition, a unique crane system 
(Figure 2) is developed to avoid the worst conditions of high flow.  The crane system in this study is made of 
an 300 lb soundings and modified into ADP hanging equipment (Figure 3). It is then carried by a crane truck 
to be mobilized for observations.  As for the immediate data of cross-sectional velocity, wireless equipment 
is used to transmit the data to the far end computer.  The ADP instrument developed for this study is 
assembled with miniature acoustic Doppler current profilers (Mini ADP hereafter), Electronics Assembly, and 
necessary accessories.

where D is the water depth; y, distance from the channel bed; h, the location of umax.  By the way of 
regression analysis, after the velocity distribution equation of most possible cross-sectional velocity has been 
found, the mean vertical velocity can be obtained by integrating the equation [6-7](Chen，2005；Chen and 
Chiu，2002) 
4. FLOOD DISCHARGE MEASUREMENT 
During 2007, 7 flood discharge measurements were done at the study site.  In the process, ADP was 
submerged only 20cm below water surface to measure velocity profiles.  The immediate data by Mini ADP 
was then to be transmitted through wireless system into the computer for instant calculations of 3D velocity 
distribution, sonic and depth variations.  Under the maximum velocity exceeding 5 m/s and the maximum 
depth of 5 m, ADP performed well under pressure and was able to provide the required flow field information. 
The velocity profiles by ADP were applied to the velocity distribution equation based on probability to obtain 
the values of mean velocities and rates. Then the complete profiles were used to draw each cross-section’s 
velocity profile segment.  Each measurement was the result of the probability distribution equation 
calculating the mean velocity with the water depth and the midsection method for the flow rate.   
Figure 4 displays the cross-section of the Lan-Shan Bridge with gage height being 111.57 m during Typhoon 
Krosa, and each serial number is shown on the vertical line.  18 water depths are made by ADP with the 
maximum water depth of 4.47 m.  Figure 5 shows the actual measurements of velocity distribution on the 18 
verticals, in which the point 15 is the velocity of the maximum vertical depth and the point 7 is of the 
minimum vertical depth.  In addition, the maximum velocity (4.83 m/s)happened on vertical 22, and the flow 
rate is 447.61m3/s and the maximum cross-section velocity is greater than 5 m/s.  The velocity distribution 
in Figure 5 can be used to draw the isovels, as shown in Figure 6.

The relationship between gage height and cross-sectional area is established as seen in Figure 7.  The data 
analysis indicates that the maximum velocities occur constantly at the vertical 19.  Figure 8 shows the 
relationship between the maximum and mean velocities, which is the straight segment passing through the 
origin.  Hence, the maximum velocity can be measured hereafter at this location and be multiplied by the 
cross-section coefficient so to estimate the cross-sectional mean velocity.  Consequently the flow rate is the 
multiplication value of the cross-section area derived from the water level and the estimated mean velocity.
