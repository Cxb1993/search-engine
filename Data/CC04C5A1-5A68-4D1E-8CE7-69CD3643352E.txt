Abstract 
In the present study, the micro-structure of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) of PEMFC is designed in 
order to promote the cell performance with a better water management. To be specific, the anode is 
hydrophilic treated, while the cathode is hydrophobic modified. We prepared silica/Nafion composite 
membrane by impregnation of Nafion 117 membrane via the sol-gel process with tetraethoxysilane (TEOS). 
Silica/Nafion composite membrane were then used to prepare MEA with the anode and cathode gas diffusion 
layers. The PEMFC performances and electrochemical properties of these MEAs were investigated using 
polarization and ac-impedance methods at various temperatures and humidified conditions.  
We further improved the cell performance by inserting hydrophilic SiO2, again made from the TEOS 
sol-gel process, to the anode catalyst layer and anode micro-porous layer to improve the hydrophilic property 
of the anode compartment. 
  For the cathode humidified feed, the impedance spectra of single cell operated at various temperatures, 
showed that the membrane-deducted cell resistance is decreased with the current increase; however, as the 
current value is above a certain value, the resistance is increased due to the mass transfer limitation of oxygen 
caused by the liquid water flooding in cathode. In the case of dry oxygen supply to the cathode, the cell 
resistance (membrane deducted) is larger than that with cathode humidification, indicating the increased 
impedance resulting from poor kinetics of the interfacial oxygen reduction reaction caused by the low level of 
water content in the cathode catalyst layer. In addition, the high frequency resistance (HFR) decreases along 
with the discharged current density, indicating the gradual wetting of the membrane.  
 
Keywords: PEM fuel cell; SiO2; hydrophilic treatment; composite membrane, water management. 
 
Introduction 
One of the major difficulties encountered in PEMFC development is the elaborate water and thermal 
management needed to achieve optimal performance. Membrane dehydration also causes the membrane to 
shrink, reducing the contact between the electrode and membrane, and introduce pinholes leading to the 
crossover of the reactant gases. 
The PEMFC is composed of the proton exchange membrane, catalyst layers, micro-porous layers and gas 
diffusion layers called the membrane electrode assembly (MEA). The outermost parts of proton exchange 
membrane fuel cell are bipolar plates, engraved with grooves on the surface, used as the gas flow channels. 
Proton exchange membrane is a proton conductive polymer film, normally provided as the commercial 
products manufactured by the DuPont. Both cathode and anode use platinum nano-particle as the catalyst, 
which is distributed on the conductive and high surface area carbon particle support. Fig. 1 is the schematic of 
proton exchange membrane fuel cell.

decreased; however, the film's mechanical strength becomes weaker. 
Experimental procedures 
Sol - gel method is used as the method to prepare hydrophilic membrane and anode catalyst layer, which is 
one of the hydrolysis deposition methods to create nanoparticles. In the acidic environment, the hydrolysis 
rate of alkyl silicon will be fast, but the condensation rate will be relatively slow; the SiO2 is easy to generate 
network structure. In the alkaline environment, the hydrolysis rate of alkyl silicon will be slow and 
condensation rate is faster; the SiO2 is easy to generate large size particles.  
The preparation of silica/Nafion composite membrane is as follows. TEOS/HCl/water (25/0.22/8.64 in 
gram ratio) solution was prepared with stirring at room temperature. The solution was then mixed with 
appropriate methanol. Nafion 117 membrane was impregnated in a methanol/water (2/1 by volume ratio) 
mixture solution, and then the membrane was impregnated into TEOS/HCl/water /methanol solution. The 
membrane was washed with water to clean the TEOS covered on the surface of the membrane. The membrane 
was cured at 100℃ for 1 hour. Finally, the membrane was soaked with 2 M sulfuric acid for 4 hours.  
Preparation of hydrophilic micro-porous layer is as follows. The required quantity of acetylene black 
carbon (0.5mg/cm2) was wetted with a small amount of isopropanol. The mixed solution was stirred and 
ultrasonicated, followed by an addition of the Nafion solution and TEOS/HCl/water. The solution was further 
stirred and ultrasonicated to prepare the hydrophilic micro-porous layer ink. The ink was coated on the carbon 
paper by a brush method and dried at 80℃, repeatedly until the desired loading was obtained. The gas 
diffuser was dried in the vacuum oven at 100℃.  
Preparation of hydrophilic catalyst layer is as follows. The required quantity of 20 wt% Pt/C (0.4mg/cm2) 
was wetted with a small amount of isopropanol. The mixed solution was stirred and ultrasonicated, followed 
by an addition of the Nafion solution and TEOS/HCl/water, further stirred and ultrasonicated. The catalyst ink 
was coated over the hydrophilic micro-porous layer by a brush method and dried at 80℃, repeatedly until the 
desired loading was obtained. The electrode was dried for 1 hour in the vacuum oven at 100℃. 
Commercial 20 wt.% proofed carbon paper was used as the gas diffuser for the cathode. The fabrication 
of cathode catalyst and micro-porous layers followed our previous research works [7]. The MEA was 
prepared by placing two electrodes (active area: 5.76 cm2), on both sides of the membrane and hot-pressing at 
135℃ and 100 kg/cm2 for 5 min. 
Results and Discussion 
   The hydrophilic material was confirmed with Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, as shown 
in Fig. 2. It shows a characteristic peak at 1074 cm-1 corresponding to the Si-O-Si bonds.

The MEAs of silica/Nafion composite membrane with different content of silica were studied. The anode 
catalyst layer and anode micro-porous layer were inserted with 5wt.% SiO2. The cathode feed was either fully 
humidified or non-humidified, while different anode humidification temperature is employed. Hydrogen and 
oxygen flow rates were 200 c.c./min and 300 c.c./min. Loading of Pt/C on the anode and cathode were 
specified at 0.4mg/cm2. 
Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 showed the polarization of silica/Nafion composite membrane with different content of 
silica operated at T cell =80℃. The cell performance was increased with the increase of the anode humidifier 
temperature, but the polarization was increased as the temperature was further increased to 80℃ due to the 
liquid water flooding, resulting in a decreased cell performance at high current densities. In the 
non-humidified cathode feed case in Fig. 7, the best performance was obtained for the silica/Nafion-TEOS 
(1/5).

Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 show the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy diagrams for the silica/Nafion 
composite membrane operated at Tcell =80℃, and the anode feeds were operated under different humidified 
conditions. In the cathode humidified case in Fig. 10, the diameter of the measured semicircle is decreased 
with the increasing current, but as the current is above a certain value, the diameter of the measured semicircle 
is increased instead. The mass transfer limitation of oxygen is caused by the water flooding in cathode. In the 
case of dry oxygen supply to the cathode in Fig. 11, the diameter of the loop is larger than that in Fig. 10, 
indicating the increased impedance resulting from poorer kinetics of the interfacial oxygen reduction reaction 
caused by the low level of water content in the cathode catalyst layer. When the current density is increased, 
more water is produced, high frequency resistance decreases gradually, indicating an improved wet 
environment within the MEA.

Fig. 13 The ohmic resistance of different cathode humidified conditions at dry oxygen feed. 
 
Conclusion 
  The MEAs of silica/Nafion composite membrane with different contents of silica were studied. The anode 
catalyst layer and anode micro-porous layer were inserted with 5wt.% SiO2. The best performance was the 
silica/Nafion-TEOS (1/5).  
In the cathode humidified case, the diameter of the measured semicircle was decreased with the current, 
until a certain value is arrived; however, after that, the impedance was increased with current due to the mass 
transfer resistance. In the case of dry oxygen supply to the cathode, the impedance loop was larger than that 
with humidification, indicating the increased impedance resulting from poorer kinetics of the interfacial 
oxygen reduction reaction caused by the low level of water content in the cathode catalyst layer. When the 
current density was increased, more water was produced; the membrane resistance was then decreased, 
indicating an improved wet environment within the MEA.

(i) On the oxygen mass transfer, J. Zhang et al. (GM and MIT) Proposed a noval method to produce 
oxygen on the anode (IrOx) by oxidation of water so that in situ generated oxygen can be transferred 
through the membrane to be reduced on the nitrogen passed cathode. In this way, the permeation rate of 
oxygen in membrane can be measured. S. Sambandam and V. Ramani (IIT) inserted a Pt wire as a working 
electrode at the middle of PEM. Once WE potential is stepped, the oxygen transferred from one side and 
the proton from the other side will reacted on WE. The oxygen diffusivity and solubility can be determined 
independently by the transient Fick’s law. The experiment was done at various RH and temperatures. An 
interesting discovery by U. Pasaogullari and his co-workers shows the importance of inert gas diffusivity, 
and thermal effect as well, on oxygen transport in a single cell. According to their calculation, because of 
the difference in binary diffusivities of O2-N2-H2O and O2-He-H2O systems, the predicted I-V has large 
deviations in the high current density region. As for the thermal effect, the ohmic resistance generated heat 
at high current may raise ca. 4oC in MEA, which corresponds to a 20% increase of saturation pressure, and 
about 20% decrease of water activity. This is reflected on the high frequency resistance (HFR) at high 
over-voltages.  
(ii) Water balance is always a focus at all times of low temperature PEFC. Yim et al. (Korea Institute 
of Energy Research) inserted TiO2 particles into the catalyst layer to enhance the water absorption 
capability so that the cell can be operated at dry feeds. This can be compared to our study using sol-gel 
technique produced SiO2 particles within anode catalyst layer to increase the hydrophilic property. In 
our study, there is an optimum amount of incorporation. Higher content of SiO2 favors water retention 
but increase the ohmic resistance and lower the active area volume density. As a consequence, an 
intermediate content is appropriate. E. Chalkova et al. (Penn State) made P2O5-SiO2 incorporated 
composite membrane for cell operation at reduced humidity situation. It was found that sol-gel 
produced recast membrane and impregnated commercial membrane by precursors are with similar 
performance; while the method with inorganic particles addition is inferior. The water dynamic 
behavior studied using EIS is a hot topic recently. It was shown by M. N. Bayer et al. (PSI), water 
content in ionomer phase can be detected in low frequency response since the electrolyte conductivity 
changes with frequency and a capacitive loop is observed. EIS was also used by S. Holdcroft and 
co-workers (Institute of Fuel Cell Innovation and Simon Fraser University) for low RH behavior at 
specified temperature. Unfortunately, due to their wrongly prescribed operating condition, the 
MEA durability and non-noble catalyst development. Nowadays, SOFC gradually attracts people’s eye. As for 
the ECS organization itself, it faces the challenges of other electrochemical science related journals (especially 
that from Elsevier). The publication cost charged to the author is severe, and the waiting period of publication is 
relatively long compared to other journals. However, the high standard required by ECS journal paper is always 
a warrant of long term accuracy of the electrochemical knowledge.
