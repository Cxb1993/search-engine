ABSTRACT 
This is a Taiwan-Japan international cooperation research project. In our side, the 
researches can be divided into two major parts, to clarify the separation properties of 
difficult-to-filter soft and nano colloidal particles in membrane filtration, and to afford the 
optimum design and processing of environmentally-friendly innovative membrane filtration. 
In the first year (2009/7-2010/8), the mechanisms of the membrane fouling have been 
clarified by investigating the behaviors of the formation of the filter cake and the clogging of 
membrane pores, resulting in the dramatic flux decline during membrane filtration. Some 
important co-research results have been published in famous journals (Hwang et al., 2009; 
Iritani et al., 2010). In this year, environmentally-friendly, innovative membrane filtration 
systems were developed in order to separate difficult-to-filter soft and nano colloidal particles 
efficiently on the basis of those fundamental findings in both sides.  
 
Keywords: membrane filtration, microfiltration, ultrafiltration, membrane fouling, 
nano-particles, soft colloids 
 
二、緣由與目的 
奈米粒子及軟膠體粒子(例如光觸媒、水
膠、蛋白質、乳膠、微生物細胞及鬆散的絮
狀物等) 之固-液分離已經成為生物、食品及
醫藥技術與廢水處理等眾多工業程序所不可
或缺，尤其在台灣變得愈來愈重要，因為台
灣缺乏自然資源，而且皆需仰賴工業以生產
高附加價值的產品，例如食品加工、醫藥製
造及新材料開發等。過去幾年申請人已開始
研究軟膠體與奈米粒子的固-液分離技術，目
前也已經發表了一些基礎的研究成果。為持
續保有在此研究領域既有的優勢，結合世界
上頂尖的研究學者與持續發展是極為必要
的。所以這個研究計畫就是與日本名古屋大
學的精密分離研究群合作，目的在於闡明在
薄膜過濾中奈米與軟膠體粒子的分離及結垢
特性，並藉以研發高效能的精密薄膜過濾技
術。 
 
三、研究方法

 軟硬度對濾速影響甚大。無論是濾餅過濾或
是掃流過濾，當粒子的壓縮性越高，濾速越
低。較軟的粒子會形成較緊密的濾餅，所以
過濾比阻較高、濾速較低，故粒子 C 有最低
的濾速。粒子 A 的濾速為粒子 C 的 5 倍，粒
子 B 的濾速也比粒子 C 高 50%。

濾速數據代入力平衡模式 (Hwang 與 Lin, 
2002；Hwang 等人, 2006)估算。在過濾初期，
由於濾速迅速衰減，使得粒子附著機率急速
地減小；這個效應對粒子 C 更為顯著，這表
示粒子 C 所構成的濾餅薄，且在極早的階段
即已形成。因為粒子 B 的濾速比粒子 A 稍
高，故在過濾初期粒子 B 的附著機率較高。
然而，由於較顯著的濾餅壓縮與濾速衰減，
在1000秒之後粒子B的附著機率反而變得較
低。此外，因為粒子 C 最為軟性，高壓縮性
的濾餅使得在過濾初期的粒子附著機率即降
的相當低。圖中的曲線亦顯示，在一段期間
的過濾之後，粒子的附著機率皆會降到極小
的數值。可以看出達到擬穩態的所需的時間

的粒徑相近，較軟的粒子有較少的粒子附著。

然而，濾餅平均孔隙度在過濾過程中的變化
迥異於透水試驗；在壓力為 300 kPa 的恆壓

本研究之pH值操作條件為 5、7 及 9，比
較各pH值溶液之粒徑大小為：pH 7 >> pH 5 
≧ pH 9，因為凝聚的緣故，大粒子與大粒子
堆疊較為鬆散，濾餅孔隙度大而有較小的濾
餅阻力，因此會得到比較高的濾速，如Fig. 9
所示。在不同透膜壓力及掃流速度之下，pH

因pH 5 的粒子略大於等於pH 9 的粒子，使得

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Particle preparation
Three kinds of dextran were purchased from SIGMA® Co. and
used in gel particle preparation. Their molecular weights were 70,
500 and 2000kDa, respectively. In the preparation of each kind
of gel particle, a selected dextran was dissolved in pure ethanol
to prepare a 2.0wt% solution. A 1.5wt% KMnO4 aqueous solu-
tion was then slowly added into the dextran–ethanol solution
using a 1:6 weight ratio. The detailed procedures for preparing the
highly cross-linked agarose matrix on forming MnO2 particles are
described in the authors’ most recent paper [10]. Brieﬂy, the solu-
tion was stirred continuously at 4 ◦C for 1h and then at 25 ◦C for
24h until the chemical reaction was complete. After removing the
residual ethanol in the upper layer, the gel particles were washed
by adding de-ionized water. The gel particles were washed under
continuous agitation for 60min and then centrifuged to remove
most freewater. Thesewashingprocedureswere repeated for three
times. A small amount of solution was sampled to detect the resid-
ual ethanol by dropping K2Cr2O7 as an indicator. It was veriﬁed
that no any residual ethanol existed in the particles and suspen-
sion after the reaction andwashing procedures because of the color
still in reddish orange. The formed gel particles were porous; and
the volume fraction of water in the particles was measured as 0.76
usinga thermal gravitational analyzer (TGA) [3]. Thereexistedwell-
deﬁned interface between particle and liquid phases, as the SEM
analysis shown in the authors’ previous study [10]. The size dis-
tributions and zeta potentials of those particles were measured
using a HORIBA LA-910 laser particle sizer and Malvern MRK528-01
Zetasizer Nano System, respectively. The particles prepared using
dextran with different softness but nearly the same size distribu-
tion. The particle sizes ranged from0.1 to 5.0mwith amean value
ca 0.55m based on volume. The detail particle size distributions
can be referred to Hwang et al. [10]. No particle coagulation or frac-
ture was found during experiments by checking the particle size
distribution. The retardation time and particle softness index for
cake compression, deﬁned and measured in Hwang et al. [3,10], are
listed in Table 1. The sample IDs, A–C,were used to represent differ-
ent kinds of gel particles prepared by different dextran molecular
weights. The cake compression retardation times for three kinds of
gel particles were similar. However, the particle softness increased
with increasing dextran molecular weight. This meant Particle A
was the hardest, while Particle C was the softest.
2.2. Filtration experiments
The microﬁltration experiments were carried out using a two-
parallel-plate cross-ﬂowﬁlter. A schematic diagramof theﬁltration
system is shown in Fig. 1. Theﬁlter channel hada clearanceof 1mm,
a width of 2 cm, and a ﬁltration area of 1.1×10−3 m2. A 0.1m
ﬁlter membrane made of mixed cellulose ester was used in exper-
iments as the ﬁlter medium. The virgin membrane resistance was
2.97×1011 m−1 under a ﬁltration pressure of 100kPa. A 0.1wt%
gel particle suspension was prepared in the suspension tank and
mixed well using a stirrer. The suspension temperature was kept

at 25 ◦C using a thermostat. The suspension pH was ca 7 after the
preparation, and no obvious variation was found during ﬁltration.
The suspension was pumped into the cross-ﬂow ﬁlter using a peri-
stalsis pump. The cross-ﬂow velocity was controlled and measured
using a rotameter, while the ﬁltration pressure was adjusted using
a needle valve and indicated on the pressure gauges. The ﬁltrate
was collected into a receiver and its’ weight was measured using
a load cell. The ﬂux data were then calculated and recorded in a
personal computer. When the experiment was terminated, the ﬁl-
ter cake was carefully removed from the ﬁlter channel and sent to
analyze its wet and dry cake masses using an infrared-ray moisture
meter. Because the drying rates of free water, interstitial water and
interior water in the ﬁlter cake were different due to their bound-
ing energies, the water bound in the gel particles and existed in
the interstices were determined from the drying curve [15]. The
mass of the bound water should be included into the cake mass,
while the cake porosity was calculated from the volume fraction of
interstitial water (the water outside the gel particles). The average
speciﬁc cake ﬁltration resistance could then be calculated using the
basic ﬁltration equation once the cake mass was known.

gel particles under us = 0.3m/s and P=80kPa. The ﬁltration ﬂux
attenuates very quickly at the ﬁrst 1000 s due to the particle depo-

the shortest separation distance between depositing particles is
determined, the inter-particle forces can be calculated. From the
data shown in Table 2, the drag forces due to ﬂuid ﬂows and inter-
particle forces always play themost important roles in determining
the particle deposition within the operating conditions used in this
study.
Once the external forces are obtained, the force balance model
derived in the authors’ previous studies [8,9] is used to estimate
the particle deposition probability on the membrane surface. For
a depositing particle which is transported just arriving at the
cake surface and contacts with a deposited particle, the forces are
divided into twovectors, F1 and F2,whichdirections arevertical and
parallel to the connected line between the centers of the deposit-
ingparticle and its contactingparticle, respectively. Theparticle can
deposit stably only when the net force in the tangential direction is
smaller than the friction force. At the critical condition, which the
depositing particle can just deposit stably on its contact point, the
force balance model can be expressed as:
F1 = fc · F2 (1)
The friction coefﬁcients between particles used in the model, fc,
are regressed from the experimental data using the hydrodynamic
method for determining the particle critical deposition [21] and
also listed in Table 1. Particle A exhibits the highest friction coef-
ﬁcient and of course the largest friction force between particles
under a given condition. The particle deposition probability is then
estimated by checking the surface area fraction causing stable
deposition [8,9].
Fig. 5 shows the calculated deposition probability of Particle B
under various cross-ﬂow velocities and ﬁltration ﬂuxes using the
force balance model. For each curve, a higher ﬁltration ﬂux results

probability.
in higher deposition probability due to higher normal drag force
exerted on the depositing particles. Comparing the curves shown in
Fig. 5 under a ﬁxedﬁltrationﬂux, the higher the cross-ﬂowvelocity,
the lower the deposition probability will be. This can be expected
because the higher shear force causing by higher cross-ﬂow veloc-
ity leads the particles to become more unstable to remain on the
membranesurface. This effect ismoresigniﬁcantunder lowerﬁltra-
tion ﬂux. In the us = 0.5m/s condition, a drastic decrease in particle
deposition probability under a ﬂux lower than 3×10−5 m3/(m2 s)
is found. This reveals extremely difﬁcult particle deposition in such
a condition. The ﬁltration ﬂux attenuation during ﬁltration leads to
a decrease in the cake growth rate and apseudo-steady statewill be
attained when the particle deposition probability becomes trivial.
Fig. 6 shows the time courses for particle deposition probability
for three different gel particles under us = 0.5m/s andP=80kPa.
The probability values are calculated by substituting the experi-
mental ﬁltration ﬂux data into the force balance model mentioned
previously. Some scattered values are therefore observed. The par-
ticle deposition probability decays very quickly in the early 500 s
caused by the drastic decrease in ﬁltration ﬂux. This effect is more
signiﬁcant for Particle C. It implies that the cake formed by Particle
C is thin and most of the cake growth occurs in the early ﬁltration
stage. Because the ﬁltration ﬂux for Particle B is slightly higher than
that for Particle A, the deposited probability of Particle B is higher
at the beginning of ﬁltration. However, the probability becomes
lower than that of ParticleA after 1000 s because ofmore signiﬁcant
cake compression and ﬂux attenuation. On the other hand, because
Particle C exhibits the most softness, the highly compressible cake
reduces the deposition probability to an extremely low value in
the early ﬁltration period. The curve trend in Fig. 6 indicates that

ations of cake thickness and average speciﬁc ﬁltration resistance
during ﬁltration can then be analyzed as follows.
The relationship between the mass and thickness of jth cake
layer can be obtained using a material balance for the cake layer. It
can be expressed as:

where s is the particle density. Therefore, the thickness of each
cake layer can be calculated once the mass and porosity are esti-
mated using the method described previously; and the whole cake
thickness is obtained by summing the value of each layer. Fig. 9
shows the time courses for the cake thickness for three kinds of
gel particles under us = 0.5m/s and P=140kPa. The cake grows
quickly in the ﬁrst 500 s. This is because the lower ﬁltration resis-
tance results in higher ﬁltration ﬂux as well as higher particle
deposition probability in that period. However, the cake growth
becomes slower after a period of ﬁltration. This is attributed to
the quicker ﬂux decay due to the cake formation and signiﬁcant
cake compression. The cake thickness remainsnearly constant after
6000 s because no more particles can be deposited under such
condition. This is the reason a cross-ﬂow ﬁltration system can be
operated under constant ﬁltration ﬂux for a long time. Compar-
ing the curves shown in Fig. 9, the cake thickness increases with
decreasing dextran molecular weight (or particle softness). This
is because harder particles exhibit less deformation, resulting in
higher ﬁltration ﬂux and higher deposition probability during ﬁl-
tration. Although the deposition probabilities for Particles A and B
are similar in the early ﬁltration period, as shown in Fig. 6, more
severe cake compression causes the cake formed by Particle B to
be thinner. Comparing the data shown in Fig. 9 with previous stud-
ies [8,9], the thickness of a cake formed by soft particles is much
thinner than that formed by rigid particles of the same size.
The speciﬁc ﬁltration resistance of a cake layer can be theoreti-
cally estimated using the Kozeny–Carman equation, i.e.:
˛ = kS
2
o(1 − ε)
sε3
(6)
where k is the Kozeny constant, So is the effective speciﬁc surface
areaof particles. TheKozeny constant is equal to5.0 for rigid spheri-
cal particleswith a smooth surface.However, itmaybe a functionof
the particle shape and cake porosity formost particles [23]. Accord-
ing to the results derived using a free cell model, the relationship
between the Kozeny constant and cake porosity can be expressed
as [23]:
k = ε
3[3 + 2(1 − ε)5/3]
6 − 9(1 − ε)4/3 + 9(1 − ε)8/3 − 6(1 − ε)3
(7)
Prior to estimating the speciﬁc ﬁltration resistance using Eq.
(6), the relationship between the speciﬁc surface area of particle
(the particle compression behavior) and cake porosity (the cake
compression behavior) should be known. In this study, these com-
pression behaviors are coupled using the deﬁnition of particle
softness index [10]. The microscopic properties for particle com-
pression are lumped into this index for simplicity. According to the
particle softness index deﬁned in Hwang et al. [10], the effective
speciﬁc surface area can be related to the cake porosity as:
So = B · ε−m (8)
where B is a coefﬁcient and m is the so-called “particle softness
index”. The softness indexes can be measured in ﬂuid permeation
experiments [10], and the values for three used gel particles are
listed in Table 1. The k and So values can be evaluated by employing
Eqs. (7) and (8) once the cake porosity is obtained using Eq. (2).
The speciﬁc ﬁltration resistance of a cake layer can be estimated
by substituting the k and So values into Eq. (6); and the average
speciﬁc cake ﬁltration resistance can then be given by
˛av =
˙˛j ·wc,j
wc
(9)
Fig. 10 shows the variations in calculated average speciﬁc cake
ﬁltration resistance for Particle B during ﬁltration under three
different cross-ﬂow velocities. The ﬁltration pressure is ﬁxed as
80kPa. Although the data shown in this ﬁgure were obtained for
Particle B, the same tendency was also found for the other two gel
particles. The ˛av value drastically increases in the ﬁrst 500 s due
to cake compression. This effect is more signiﬁcant under higher
cross-ﬂow velocity. The severe particle deformation leads the ˛av
value to increase over 20-fold in that period. This fact indicates that
a compact skin layer is formed due to the particle deformation. The
ﬁltration ﬂux decays very quickly because both the ˛av andwc val-
ues increase signiﬁcantly. Comparing the curves shown in Fig. 10,
an increase in cross-ﬂow velocity leads to a higher ˛av value. This
can be expected since the skin layer plays the most important role
in determining the cake ﬁltration resistance. A thinner cake formed
under higher cross-ﬂow velocity sustains more solid compressive
pressure per unit cake thickness. As a result, the skin layer becomes
more compact and exhibits higher ﬁltration resistance. The ˛av

ABSTRACT 
 
Polysaccharides are frequently produced by microbial metabolism in fermentation broths or 
bioreactors. This substance often causes membrane filtration difficulty. The polysaccharide 
concentration effects on the microfiltration characteristics of microbial cells are discussed in this 
study. Yeast and dextran are used as typical microbial cell and polysaccharide samples. The results 
show that polysaccharides play important roles in filtration performance. The filter cake exhibits a 
more compact structure and much higher filtration resistance when dextran molecules pack into the 
yeast cake structure. Some dextran molecules also adsorb onto the walls in membrane pores, 
reducing the pore size, resulting in membrane fouling. The filtration resistances due to filter cake 
and membrane internal fouling are analyzed using filtrate volume versus time experimental data. 
These resistances increase significantly with the filtration pressure and dextran concentration. The 
cake properties in constant pressure microfiltration of yeast-dextran mixtures with different 
compositions are also analyzed. An increase in dextran concentration leads to lower cake growth 
rate, lower cake porosity and much higher average specific cake filtration resistance.  
 
Keywords: Microfiltration, Membrane Filtration, Bio-Separation, Cake Properties 
 
 
1. Introduction 
Microfiltration has been widely used in the primary product purification step in fermentation 
broths or bioreactors in recent years. In such biological mixture microfiltration, microbial cells are 
retained by the filter membrane to form a filter cake. Small components such as polysaccharides, 
proteins, etc., are able to penetrate through the membrane into the filtrate. The filtration resistance 
may be markedly increased due to the packing of polysaccharides or proteins into cake structures 
[1]. As a result, ignoring this effect will cause an extremely low filtration rate as well as higher 
operating costs.  
Although many methods have been proposed for analyzing filtration data [2], the cake 
properties are usually related to the filtration pressure using power-type empirical equations for 
simplicity [3]. However, the cakes formed by deformable or soft particles, such as biological 
particles, may exhibit viscoelastic behaviors (creeping effects) during compression [4–6]. These 
suspended in de-ionized water and heated to 80oC for 20 min to deactify the cells. Dextran with a 
molecular weight of 2,000 kDa, manufactured by Sigma Co. in USA, was used in these experiments 
as the polysaccharide sample. Yeast and dextran were suspended in a 10 mM buffer solution 
prepared using sodium phosphate (Na2HPO3) and sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2). The yeast 
concentration was fixed at 1 kg/m3, while three dextran concentrations, 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 kg/m3, were 
prepared. The bulk density and mean size of the yeast cells were 1140 kg/m3 and 4.6 μm, 
respectively. The filter membrane was made of mixed cellulose ester manufactured by Millipore Co. 
in USA. Its mean pore size was 0.025 μm.  
Constant pressure dead-end microfiltration experiments were carried out using a bomb filter. 
The detail was shown in the authors’ previous studies [5, 6]. The filtration area in the filter chamber 
was 8.55 x 10-4 m2. Suspensions with different concentrations were prepared and agitated using a 
magnetic mixer to prevent particle sedimentation. The pH and temperature of the suspension were 
7.0 and 25oC, respectively. The filtration pressure was supplied using compressed air and adjusted 
using a regulator. The filtrate was weighed using a load cell. The filtrate volume data versus time 
were transferred to a personal computer for further analyses. The dextran concentration in the 
filtrate was measured using the phenol/sulfuric acid method. The filtrate sample was colored using 
phenol and dewatered using sulfuric acid. The dextran concentration was then measured using a 
UNICAM UV/Visible spectrometer with a wavelength of 299 nm. When a filtration experiment was 
terminated, the cake porosity was analyzed using an infrared-ray moisture meter (AD-4714A, AND 
Co., Japan) [6].  
The filtration resistances were caused by the cake formation, the internal membrane fouling 
and the virgin membrane. The virgin membrane resistance was measured by penetrating the buffer 
solution through the membrane before each experiment. The overall filtration resistance was 
calculated using the filtration rate data. When an experiment was terminated the cake formed on the 
membrane surface was carefully removed. The filtration resistance due to membrane internal 
fouling was then measured by flowing a buffer solution through the rinsed membrane. The cake 
resistance was obtained by subtracting the others from the overall resistance.  
 
3. Results and Discussion 
3.1 Filtration characteristics 
According to the resistance-in-series model, the basic filtration equation can be expressed as: 
( )mifc RRR
P
dt
dvq ++== μ
Δ            (1) 
where q is the filtration flux, v is the received filtrate volume per unit area, t is the filtration time, 
ΔP is the filtration pressure, μ is the fluid viscosity, and Rc, Rif and Rm are the filtration resistances 
caused by the filter cake, membrane internal fouling and virgin membrane, respectively. When pure 
dextran was filtered most of the dextran molecules penetrated through the membrane pores because 
they are much smaller than the pore size. In this condition no evident cake can be observed and the 
measured cake resistance is negligible. The main filtration resistance is therefore caused by 
membrane internal fouling. The adsorption of dextran molecules onto the membrane pore walls 
decreases the effective membrane pore size and increases the filtration resistance. This is similar to 
that observed in previous studies [16–17]. In this condition Rc is negligible and the reciprocal of Eq.

The filtrate volume at dextran adsorption equilibrium increases with increasing filtration pressure. 
This reveals that the membrane fouling becomes more severe under higher applied pressures. This 
trend is similar to a general adsorption isotherm or those occurring in previous studies [16–18].

It can be inferred from previous analysis that the filtration resistance caused by membrane 
internal fouling increases with time (or filtrate volume) and finally reaches a maximum (equilibrium) 
value during constant pressure yeast-dextran mixture filtration. Figure 3 shows comparisons of the 
maximum Rif values between the results calculated using the method described previously and the 
experimental data under various filtration pressures for yeast-dextran suspensions with different 
dextran concentrations. The calculated results agree fairly well with the experimental data. This fact 
demonstrates that the relationships between Rif and v for dual and sole dextran suspensions are 
nearly the same under conditions that most dextran molecules have the opportunity to penetrate 
through the membrane pores. Furthermore, the Rif values have an order-of-magnitude of 1013 m-1 
and are power functions of ΔP given from the regressed curves for the experimental data. These 
data reveal that the membrane internal fouling plays an important role in determining the overall 
filtration resistance and the Rif value will increase drastically with increasing filtration pressure. 
Comparing the data shown in Fig. 3, the Rif values for different dextran concentrations have similar 
pressure dependency and increase with increasing dextran concentration. This can be expected 
because more dextran adsorption occurs in the membrane pores under higher concentrations.  
Figure 4 shows the filtration curves for dt/dv vs. v for different suspensions under a constant 
pressure of 300 kPa. When yeast cells coexist with dextran in a suspension, the dt/dv value for a 
given v becomes much higher than that for single component filtration. This is attributed to the cake 
formation in which the dextran molecules pack in the pores obstructed by yeast cells. Consequently, 
the filtration resistance becomes much higher. Since the filtration resistance caused by membrane

where Cp and CD are the dextran concentrations in the filtrate and original suspension, respectively. 
Figure 6 shows how the dextran concentration and filtration pressure affect the dextran rejection 
after the dextran equilibrium adsorption in the membrane pores, e.g., at 20,000 s. The dextran 
rejection increases with increasing dextran concentration under a given filtration pressure. When 
the dextran concentration increases from 0.1 to 0.5 kg/m3, the dextran rejection increases 10 – 20%.

the filtration pressure for a fixed dextran concentration. The cake resistance increases ca 4 times 
when the filtration pressure increases from 50 to 300 kPa. This is attributed to greater cake 
formation and compression under higher pressures. This also implies that increasing the filtration 
pressure may not efficiently increase the filtration rate because more hydraulic pressure will be 
depleted by the drastic increase in cake resistance. An increase in dextran concentration leads to 
higher cake resistance. This is because packing more dextran molecules into the cake structure 
causes lower cake porosity and higher filtration resistance. This effect is more significant under 
higher filtration pressure.

Fig. 7 Effects of dextran concentration and filtration pressure on the cake resistance. 
 
 
Because all yeast cells will be retained by the filter membrane used in these experiments, the 
cake mass formed by solely yeast can be calculated using a material balance as shown below.

where CY is the yeast concentration in the original suspension. However, the dextran molecules also 
have the opportunity to pack into the cake structure. Their masses should be considered in the cake

mixture can be calculated using

value, most hydraulic pressures are depleted by the compact cake structure, the αav value then 
decreases and gradually approaches a pseudo-steady value. This trend can be explained by the 
compression behavior of cakes formed by soft or deformable particles [5, 6]. Based on these results, 
one knows that most cake compressions formed by yeast-dextran mixtures occur before 4,000 s and 
the cake properties approach pseudo-steady after 20,000 s. The dextran concentration plays an 
important role in determining the αav value, especially for the maximum value occurring at the most 
serious cake compression state. As one’s expectation, an increase in dextran concentration leads to 
higher αav value.

According to Tiller’s empirical equations, the relationship between αav and ΔP can be 
expressed as the following power-type empirical equation [3]: 
n
av PAΔα =               (11) 
where A and n are empirical constants. The n value is so-called the “cake compressibility” which is 
an index that indicates the sensitivity of αav to applied pressure. The αav values at 20,000 s under 
various dextran concentrations and filtration pressures are plotted in logarithmic scales in Fig. 10. 
The αav value increases with increasing ΔP value due to more serious cake compression. The αav 
value increases 3 – 5 times when ΔP increases from 50 to 300 kPa. The data under various filtration 
pressures for each suspension can be regressed to a straight line. This reveals that Tiller’s empirical 
equation, Eq. (11), is appropriate to relate αav and ΔP for the cake formed by yeast-dextran mixtures. 
The cake compressibility values are not obviously affected by the dextran concentration and are as 
high as 0.88 even after the major cake compression extent occurs. The αav value markedly increases 
due to the existence of dextran molecules in the filter cake. The αav values for CD = 0.1 and 0.5 
kg/m3 become 10-fold and 30-fold, respectively, higher than that of pure yeast cake.
