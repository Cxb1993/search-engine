Abstract 
Zn-doped CuInS2 semiconductor films were 
fabricated on indium–tin–oxide (ITO) 
substrates by chemical bath deposition. The 
morphology, crystalline, and optical properties 
of the Zn-doped CuInS2 films were 
characterized by SEM, XRD, UV-Vis and 
Ellipsometer. Additionally, the carrier density 
and flat band potential of the semiconductor 
electrodes were measured by Hall and 
potentiostat. Results show that the electrical 
property of Zn-doped CuInS2 films was 
changed from n-type to p-type semiconductors, 
when the Zn molar ratios of element for films 
were higher than 0.05. Besides, energy band 
gap and carrier densities of the Zn-doped 
samples were found in the range of 1.50 eV and 
1.99×10
15
 ~ 9.86×10
19
 cm-3, respectively. 
Furthermore, the maximum photocurrent 
density of the samples was found to be -1.60 
mA/cm2 (under the external potential of -1.0 V) 
with the largest CH3OH production capability 
of 0.025 M, when illuminated under a 150W 
Xe lamp.

1. Introduction 
New energy systems based on renewable 
and clean energy sources draw more and more 
attention due to the consciousness of fossil-fuel 
shortage and global-warming concern. In this 
regards, development of photochemical 
systems as alternative energy resources has 
become urgent. The production of hydrogen 
from water splitting through solar irradiation 
on n-type TiO2 was first initiated by Fujishima 
et al. in 1972 [1]. However, the photocatalytic 
activity of n-TiO2 under the visible-light 
illumination has yielded low quantum 
efficiency due to its high band-gap energy 
(3.0-3.2 eV). As a result, numerous attempts 
have been made to enhance photocatalytic 
efficiency by doping the transition metal ions 
within TiO2 [2-5]. I-III-VI2 ternary 
semiconductors are now subject to considerable 
research interest, since their band gap lies 
between 0.8 and 2.0 eV. As a result, they are 
classified as visible-light responsive 
photocatalysts [6]. Additionally, these materials 
are considered good visible-light absorbers to 
the CIGS solar cell [7]. The optimal H2 
production rate achieved, however, is only 34 
μmol h-1 [8]. However, Tsuji et. al. 
demonstrated that I-III-VI2/ZnS photocatalysts 
inherit outstanding capacity in hydrogen 
generation from aqueous solutions containing 
sacrificial reagents (SO32- and S2-) under 
visible-light irradiation [9]. The H2 evolution 
rate was reported to be 8.2 L/hr-m2. 
Preparations with low cost fabrication 
technique for I-III-VI2/ZnS semiconductor thin 
films are important for industrial applications.  
However, p-type semiconductors normally 
inherit stronger corrosive resistance since they 
are cathodically protected under light 
illumination when compared with that of n-type 
semiconductors [10]. Therefore, the 
development of p-type I-III-VI semiconductor 
films was one of our research goals in this 
study. 
Semiconductor films can be prepared by a 
variety of deposition methods, such as 
electrodeposition [11], thermal evaporation 
[12-13] and solution growth techniques [14-15]. 
In addition, the p-type Sb-doped CuInS2 has 
been fabricated by vacuum evaporation method 
under substrate temperature from 100-500 0C 
[16]. A hot-press method has also been applied

3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Crystalline and microstructure analysis 
The samples (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f) 
were prepared with 0.4M Zn(NO3)2 solutions in 
various pH value. The main chemical 
compositions of the bath are the same as the 
sample (a), with the exception of Zn 
concentrations. With the decrease of the first 
step pH value, the shift of the tetragonal 
CuInS2 peak to the higher 2  angle was 
accompanied with the decrease of the first step 
pH values. In addition, this tendency was due 
to the occurrence of intrinsic defects in the 
crystal structure as the amount of Zn increased. 
Similar result was also reported by Ohasi et al. 
[18], where the particle size decreased with the 
decrease of the first step pH values, due to the 
replacement of Cu2+ and In3+ by Zn2+ ions in 
CuInS2 crystal lattice. Furthermore, the domain 
size of each sample was calculated from the 
full width at half maximum (FWHM) of its 
main XRD peak with the Scherr’s equation. 
Results show that the domain size of the 
samples (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) were found 
to be 34.57 μm, 30.73 μm, 29.77 μm, 29.77μm, 
28.87μm  and 28.84 μm, respectively. In 
addition, the values of main peak and grain size 
are summarized in Table 2. 
Fig. 2 (1)–(6) represents the SEM images 
of samples (a) - (f) at 40K magnification. A 
transition from grain to lamellar shapes in 
samples (d) - (g) was noticed. The size of the 
lamellae in sample (a) is larger than other 
samples. The changes of the microstructures 
due to the decrease of the first step pH value 
were also noted in the SEM micrographs. 
Plate-like microstructures are found in sample 
(d) - (f) as shown in Figures 2 (4) - 2(6).  
The compositions of samples (a)–(f) 
measured by EDAX are listed in Table 3. The 
atomic ratios of [Cu]:[In]:[Zn]:[S] of 
samples(a)and (b)–(f) are in the range of 1: 
1.09–1.35: 0.00–0.10:1.94–1.70. The ratios of 
S/Cu in the film decrease with a decrease of the 
first step pH value. The film structures of the 
samples (b)–(f) (with an decreasing of the first 
step pH value) are different from that of the 
un-doped sample (sample(a)).These results 
agree with the XRD diffraction patterns, 
indicating that the Zn atoms occupied some of 
the vacancy sites in the CuInS2 lattice. 
 
3.2. Optical properties 
The optical transmittance of the samples 
was measured in a range of 200-1100 nm 
as shown in Figs. 3. The maximum 
transmittance spectrum of the sample shows 
49% transmittance in visible light and the 
near-infrared region. Figs. 4 show the UV-VIS 
absorption spectra of all the samples.The onset 
wavelength of absorption spectra occurred at 
around 850 nm, corresponding to the band gap 
of 1.46 eV [19-20]. With the increase of 
decrease of the first step pH value, the onset 
band tends to slightly shift toward the shorter 
wavelength, indicating that the energy required 
to generate the electron-hole pairs became 
larger. A similar tendency was found in the 
case of Ga-doped ZnO by Kim et al. [21]. With 
an increase of carrier concentrations, an 
increase in the band gap of ZnO was noted. 
The spectra of ellipsometric angles Ψ and delta 
Δ  were measured from 400-1000 nm at an 
incident angle of 65° by Spectroscopic 
Ellipsometry. Based on the VASE models 
including a Drude oscillator, Lorentz oscillator, 
Tauc-Lorentz oscillator and Bruggeman 
Effective Medium Theory (BEMT), the optical 
constants of refractive index (n), extinction 
index (k) and film thickness (d) were obtained. 
Fig. 5 Film thickness of CuInS2 films deposited 
at various deposition parameters. The values of 
film thicknesses are in the range of 175-691 nm. 
Apparently, the film thicknesses decreased with 
a decreasing of the first step pH in the bath 
solution. 
 
3.3. Electrical properties 
The band potential of samples was 
determined by the electrochemical 
measurements and summarized in Table 4. It is 
noted that the band edge of the samples does 
not shift with the pH values of the bath solution 
since the sulfur species of the CuInS2 
semiconductors do not react with H+ or OH- 
ions in the solution. The flat band potentials of 
these samples are between -0.49 V and -0.10 V 
vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) for 
n-type compound, and between +0.12 V and 
+0.69 V vs. NHE for p-type compound. The 
flat band potentials become more positive for 
the samples containing more Zn contents in 
 6
samples (d) and (f) is shown in Figure 11. 
Under incident light of 400 nm and the external 
bias of 0V, the quantum efficiency of samples 
(c) and (f) was estimated to be 11.80 % and 
5.35 %, respectively. 
 
3.5 DRIFT characterization 
To further validate the formation of CH3OH 
on the surfaces of the samples (c) and (f), under 
darkness and visible-light illumination, was 
also studied using in situ DRIFTS. The CO2 
adsorption was significant bands at 2340 cm- 
[24]. The CO2 molecules adsorbed on the 
samples in the dark for 30 min and after 15 
minutes of illumination (Fig. 12). As indicated 
in Fig. 12 (a) and (b), the CO2 molecules 
adsorbed on sample (f) is higher than that of 
sample (c). The intensity increased with the 
increase of CuInS2 loaded fractions, and 
reached the maximum intensity for CuInS2 in 
the dark for 30 min, indicating the largest 
adsorption equilibrium of CO2 on the surface of 
CuInS2. As shown in Fig. 12, the peak at 1454 
cm-1, 1473 cm-1, 3700 cm-1 attributed to the 
δ(CH3) and ν-OH was observed and phenol was 
the only quantifiable intermediate detected in 
this study. It can be seen that, after 15 minutes 
of irradiation, the amount of adsorbed CH3OH 
for the loaded sample (f) is much higher than 
sample (c). 
 
4. Conclusions 
In this study, the Zn-doped CuInS2 films 
were deposited on ITO-coated glass substrates 
using a chemical-bath deposition. The 
structural, electrical and optical properties of 
the films were investigated. The XRD 
diffractrograms demonstrate that tetragonal 
phase is the major crystalline of the film. The 
electrical property of the sample was changed 
from n-type to p-type semiconductor, when the 
Zn molar ratios of element for films are higher 
than 0.05. Band gaps and carrier densities of 
these samples were appraised between 1.50 eV 
and between 1.99×10
15
 ~ 9.86×10
19
 cm-3, 
respectively. The flat band potentials of these 
samples lie in the range of -0.49 V to +0.10 V 
vs. normal hydrogen electrode for n-type, while 
in the range of +0.12 V to +0.69 V vs. NHE for 
p-type. The sample with the maximum 
photocurrent density in this study was found to 
be -1.6 mA/cm2 (with an external potential set 
at -1.0 V) under photon flux of 100 mW/cm2. 
Based on the characterization results, Zn-doped 
CuInS2 films were successfully prepared on 
ITO-coated glass slides using chemical-bath 
deposition. These films inherit the electrical 
properties of n-type and p-type semiconductors 
through implanting the amount of Zn in CuInS2 
films. The outstanding electrochemical 
performance and high quantum efficiency of 
the semiconductor films assure their future 
applications in water splitting.
