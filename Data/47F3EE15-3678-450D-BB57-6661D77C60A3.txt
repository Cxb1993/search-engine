blood and ES cells are stored and cultured in the 
tissue culture flasks having nano-brushes (i.e., 
Pluronic-immobilized flasks). We investigated the 
effect of the hydrophilicity of nano-segments of the 
tissue culture flasks on the viability of various 
types of stem cells including hematopoietic stem 
cells to obtain the bio-inert materials for the 
preservation and cultivation of the stem cells in the 
regenerative medicine. We also investigated the 
effect of concentration and length of Pluronic (nano-
brushes) on the tissue culture flasks on the 
viability of hematopoietic stem cells. We cultured 
not only hematopoietic stem cells but also 
mesenchymal stem cells on the Pluronic-immobilized 
tissue culture flasks. The goal of this project is 
(1) to develop the most appropriate bio-inert 
materials for the preservation and cultivation of 
various stem cells for regenerative medicine, and (2) 
to investigate the mechanism of the bio-inert 
characteristics of biomaterials having nano-brushes 
for stem cell survival from cell culture and gene 
expression in the stem cells, and (3) to show the 
importance of material engineering in regenerative 
medicine from the development of bio-inert materials.

IV. Introduction 
1. Background of this project 
Cell culture materials on which cells proliferate and differentiate have been investigated by many 
researchers, because most cells (except blood cells) are anchorage-dependent. However, the surfaces of 
bio-inert materials on which cells do not proliferate, differentiate nor de-differentiate have not yet been 
studied extensively. These materials are useful culturing and/or preserving embryonic stem (ES) cells and 
various other kinds of stem cells, including hematopoietic stem cells for regenerative medicine. The final goal 
of this project is to develop and investigate the bio-inert materials for the preservation and cultivation of stem 
cells for regenerative medicine. 
 
2. Introduction & Research Investigation 
Cell culture materials in which cells proliferate and differentiate have been investigated by many 
researchers,1-7 because most cells (except blood cells) are anchorage-dependent. A key direction to research 
the interaction between cells and materials in plastic and reconstructive surgery is how the stem cells attach to 
the scaffolds5-7 or injectable materials for transplantation into tissue defects in patients. Once the cells are 
attached to the surface of the material, intracellular signals regulating proliferation and differentiation of cells 
are generated via interaction between specific receptors and cell signaling molecules adsorbed or expressed on 
the materials. However, the surfaces of bio-inert materials on which cells do not proliferate, differentiate nor 
de-differentiate have not yet been studied extensively. These materials should be useful for the culture and/or 
preservation of embryonic stem (ES) cells8,9 and various other kinds of stem cells, including hematopoietic 
stem cells.10,11 
Here we show that, compared to three commercially available types of tissue culture flask, hematopoietic 
stem cells expressing cell surface markers, CD34 and CD133, in umbilical cord blood are preserved for an 
extended time in the Pluronic-immobilized tissue culture flask at 4 oC. We propose that the existence of 
hydrophilic segments of Pluronic F127 on the tissue culture flask induces bio-inert storage of hematopoietic 
stem cells in umbilical cord blood. We further investigated the human plasma adsorption on the controlled 
surface packing of self-assembled poly(ethylene oxide) triblock copolymer surface by surface plasmon 
resonance (SPR). 
 
3. Goals of this project 
The goal of this project is (1) to develop the most appropriate bio-inert materials having nano-segments 
for the preservation and cultivation of various stem cells for regenerative medicine, and (2) to investigate the 
mechanism of the bio-inert characteristics of biomaterials having nano-brushes for stem cell survival from cell 
culture and gene expression in the stem cells, and (3) to show the importance of material engineering in the 
regenerative medicine from the development of bio-inert materials. 
 
4. Significance and originality 
Cell culture materials on which cells proliferate and differentiate have been investigated by many 
researchers. However, the surfaces of bio-inert materials on which cells do not proliferate, differentiate nor 
de-differentiate have not yet been studied extensively. These materials are useful culturing and/or preserving

following ISHAGE (International Society of Hematotherapy and Graft Engineering) guidelines24 using 
Stem-KitTM (Beckman Coulter Co.). 
 
4. Plasma protein adsorption by ELISA 
Specific adsorption of albumin, immunoglobulin (IgG), and fibrinogen on the flasks from human plasma 
was evaluated by a method based on an antigen-antibody reaction using an enzyme-immunoglobulin 
conjugate (ELISA assay).15

CDI-activated Pluronic F68 and F127 on polylysine-coated flasks. 
 
5. Plasma protein adsorption by SPR  
SPR biosensor based on wavelength interrogation with a four-channel Teflon flow cell was used to monitor 
protein adsorption on the coated substrates.28 SPR chips were attached to the base of the prism, and optical 
contact was established using refractive index matching fluid (Cargille). Protein solutions of 1.0 mg/mL 
human fibrinogen, or BSA in phosphate buffer saline (PBS, 0.01M, pH 7.4) were delivered to the surfaces at a 
flow rate of 0.05 mL/min. Furthermore, platelet poor plasma (PPP) solution containing plasma proteins was 
also tested on the coated substrates. A surface-sensitive SPR detector was used to monitor the protein-surface 
interactions in real time. The wavelength shift was used to measure the change in surface adsorption amount 
(mass per unit area). Refractive index of PEO-PPO-PEO varies linearly in the range of concentrations used in 
this work. A refractive index increment (dn/dc) of 0.151 µL/mg was used to estimate PEO-PPO-PEO 
adsorption while 0.20 µL/mg was used for protein adsorption.

(PL127 & PL68), polystyrene tissue culture flasks (PSt); RepCellR flasks; and commercially available 
bio-inert flasks (NuncR and HydroCellR) after preservation for five days at 4˚C. 
 
after two days of storage. In contrast, the number of such cells expressing CD34+ in the Pluronic-immobilized 
flask (PL68-10 and PL127-10) was more than 40% after seven days, a result more than three times higher 
than those obtained using the other types of flasks listed above (i.e., the number ratio of CD34+ cells in the 
Pluronic-immobilized flask vs those in the other types of flasks; p < 0.05). 
Figure 3 shows the numbers of CD34+ cells in umbilical cord blood stored in PL127-1, PL127-10, 
PL127-100, PL68-1, PL68-10 and PL68-100; polystyrene; RepCellR; NuncR; and HydroCellR flasks after 
cultivation for 5 days at 4˚C. These numbers were significantly lower for the four commercial flasks than for 
any Pluronic-immobilized flask except PL68-100 (i.e., the numbers of CD34+ cells in the four commercial 
flasks vs those in the Pluronic-immobilized flask except PL68-100; p < 0.05). 
The highest number of CD34+ cells was observed in umbilical cord blood stored in the PL127-10 flask in 
this study. PL127-100, having a higher surface concentration of Pluronic F127 than PL127-10, showed a 
lower number of CD34+ cells than did PL127-1 or PL127-10. PL68 flasks coated with Pluronic F68, with 
lower molecular weight and higher hydrophilicity than Pluronic F127, also showed the same trends as 
 10
adsorption of plasma proteins might have been the foremost reason for the higher number and survival of stem 
and progenitor cells when umbilical cord blood was preserved in them. 
 
5. Plasma protein adsorption on well-covered PEO-PPO-PEO surfaces by SPR 
The adsorption of human plasma proteins (i.e., mixed proteins) on Pluronic F108 surfaces with low 
coverage of surface-bound PEO chains (Pluronic  F108-L, with GPEO of 3 PEO chains/100 nm2) and high 
coverage of surface-bound PEO chains (Pluronic F108-H, with GPEO of about 11 PEO chains/100 nm2) was 
monitored (see Figure 4) and compared in real time at 37°C using SPR. The CH3- and OEG-terminated 
self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) were used as references for comparison. Jiang’s group has reported that 
the adsorption of serum proteins was significantly reduced on OEG-SAMs as compared to the CH3-SAMs.34 
A diluted solution containing 20% (v/v, in PBS) plasma proteins from platelet poor plasma was used to reduce

equivalent to 15 ng/cm2 of adsorbed proteins.

adequate water contact angle range for our cell culture conditions. Culture on ECM-immobilized dishes 
enhances amniotic fluid stem cell differentiation into osteoblasts more than culture on polystyrene dishes 
grafted with amino groups (PS-NH2 dishes)(Fig. 7). This finding indicates that specific interactions between 
amniotic fluid cells and the ECM grafted onto the culture dishes promote the differentiation of cells into 
osteoblasts. Matrigel-immobilized dishes promoted a more extensive differentiation of amniotic fluid stem 
cells into neural cells than did ECMimmobilized dishes, but they did not promote differentiation into 
osteoblasts. Immobilization of the optimal nanosegments (ECM or Matrigel) onto culture dishes enhances 
amniotic fluid stem cell differentiation into osteoblasts and neural cells; the choice of nanosegments depends 
on the desired differentiated cell type.

This invention provides a bioreactor and method of separation, ex vivo expansion 
and harvest of hematopoietic stem cells from human umbilical cord blood, bone 
marrow aspirates or peripheral blood by simple and direct procedure. The bioreactor 
is comprised of a port of permeation of umbilical cord blood, bone marrow aspirates 
or peripheral blood through filter, and followed by a port of injection of cell culture 
medium into the filter after adhesion of hematopoietic stem cells on the filters 
separated from blood or bone marrow solution. The hematopoietic stem cells can be 
harvested in the reservoir when cell culture medium is circulated through the filter 
after peripheral blood, bone marrow aspirates or umbilical cord blood permeated 
through the filters. The bioreactor is also comprised of permeation of umbilical cord 
blood, bone marrow aspirates or peripheral blood through filter for the adhesion of 
hematopoietic stem cells on the filter, and followed by injection of cell culture 
medium into the filter after washing solution was permeated through the filter. 
Original point of this invention is that purification and ex vivo expansion of 
hematopoietic stem cells can be performed in the same bioreactor using the filter 
with an easy, fast and simple method in this invention, while the conventional 
method needs a lot of labor and complicated procedures for the isolation of 
hematopoietic stem cells from human umbilical cord blood, bone marrow aspirates 
or peripheral blood, followed by ex vivo expansion of hematopoietic stem cells by
