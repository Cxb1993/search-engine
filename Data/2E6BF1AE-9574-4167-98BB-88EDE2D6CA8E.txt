gamma distributions. Recently, Gupta & Kundu [11] 
considered the discrimination problem between 
Weibull and generalized exponential distributions. 
Kundu, Gupta, and Manglick [16] considered the 
discrimination problem between the lognormal and 
generalized exponential distributions. 
    Among the discrimination problems, the one 
for Weibull and lognormal distributions is 
particularly important and has received much 
attention (see Pereira [19]; Chen [5]; Quesenberry 
& Kent [20]). This is because the two distributions 
are the most popular ones for analyzing the lifetime 
of electronic products. Dumonceaux & Antle [9] 
adopted the ratio of maximized likelihood (RML) 
in discriminating between the two distributions for 
complete data, and provided the percentile points 
for some sample sizes by simulation. Recently, 
Kundu & Manglick [15] considered the 
discrimination problem for complete data using the 
RML procedure. They obtained the asymptotic 
distribution of the logarithm of the RML and 
determined the sample size required to discriminate 
between the two distributions for a pre-specified 
probability of correct selection. Although the 
results given in the aforementioned papers are 
interesting and valuable, it is a pity that the impacts 
of mis-specification between Weibull and 
lognormal distributions on further estimation or 
inference are not studied. By considering four mean 
squared errors of the estimators with 
mis-specification, Yu [23] studied the impact of 
mis-specification between normal and extreme 
value distributions on the estimation of a thp  
quantile for a linear regression model. The main 
purpose of the present paper is to investigate the 
effect of mis-specification between lognormal and 
Weibull distributions on the interval estimation of a 
quantile for complete data. More specifically, with 
respect to complete data, we will investigate the 
impact of mis-specification between lognormal and 
Weibull distributions on the interval estimation of a 
thp quantile of the distribution that the data follow. 
The expected widths and the covering probabilities 
of the confidence intervals (CIs) for a variety of 
combinations of sample sizes and the vales of p 
with mis-specification are computed to evaluate the 
impact of mis-specification. Because discrimination 
between lognormal and Weibull distributions is 
equivalent to that between normal and extreme 
value distributions, we will focus our attention on 
the latter in the following sections. 
    The rest of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section 2 introduces a motivating example. 
Section 3 presents the estimation of parameters and 
thp  quantiles for normal and extreme value 
distributions, respectively. Section 4 addresses the 
expected widths and the covering probabilities of a 
CI under mis-specification. Section 5 applies the 
proposed method to the motivating example 
introduced in Section 2 to illustrate the impact of 
mis-specification between normal and extreme 
value distributions. Some numerical results are 
provided to evaluate the impacts of 
mis-specification on the estimation precision in 
Section 6. Finally, we make a brief conclusion in 
Section 7. 
      
2. Motivating Example 
 
    Consider the following lifetime data of a group 
of 23 ball bearings in a fatigue test: 17.88, 28.92, 
33.00, 41.52, 42.12, 45.60, 48.40, 51.84, 51.96, 
54.12, 55.56, 67.80, 68.64, 68.64, 68.88, 84.12, 
93.12, 98.64, 105.12, 105.84, 127.92, 128.04, 
173.40. They are the number of million revolutions 
before failure. The data were originally investigated 
by Lieblein and Zelen [18] based on the assumption 
that the lifetime data arose from a Weibull 
distribution. Nevertheless, a lognormal probability 
plot of the data appears that a lognormal model also 
fits the data well. Lawless [17] calculated the CIs of 
some quantiles of the lifetime distribution under a 
lognormal model and made a comparision of the 
differences between the 0.90 CIs of 0.01, 0.10, and 
0.50 quantiles for lognormal and Weibull 
distributions.  
    In fact, Weibull and lognormal distributions 
are much alike. In practical applications, they 
usually fit the lifetime data well. However, their 
predictions may lead to a significant difference. 
That is, mis-discriminant between these two 
distributions may lead to serious bias. Figure 1 
shows the probability plots of the lifetime data for 
Weibull and lognormal distributions. The linear 
patterns in Figure 1 indicate that these two 
distributions are all appropriate for fitting the data. 
Thus, an interesting question is that if the failure 
times are actually lognormal distributed, not 
Weibull, then how “bad” will the interval 
estimation be? 
          * Figure 1 * 
    In the following sections, we will propose a 
systematic approach to address the issue.

but depends on n, p, and ς . 
 
In the next section, we will use the motivating 
example in Section 2 to illustrate this procedure. 
 
5. Motivating Example Revisited 
 
To work with the impact of mis-specification 
between lognormal and Weibull distributions, we 
convert the 23 failure times to log failure times and 
denote them by iY , i=1, 2, …, 23. 
   Assume that iY  follows one of ( )2,σμN  and 
),( buExtreme . To answer the question in Section 2, 
we need the true values of μ , 2σ , u, and b. 
According to Equations (3), (4), (12), and (13), we 
can easily obtain 
( μˆ , 2σˆ , uˆ , bˆ )=(4.1503, 0.2721, 4.4051, 0.4757). 
For illustrative purposes, we treat the values of 
μˆ , 2σˆ , uˆ , and bˆ  as the true values of μ , 2σ , u, 
and b . To see the impact of mis-discrimination on 
the interval estimation for the lifedata of ball 
bearings, we take ς =0.05 for example. Then, 
based on Equation (11), Equation (17), and 
Theorems 2-3, we can easily obtain the values of [ ]
)()( ipipi
E ξξ − , [ ]
)()( ipipj
E ξξ − , and )(MISiP , i, 
j=N, E and ji ≠ . The results are listed in Table 1 
lists the results for p=0.01, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.30, 
0.40, 0.50, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 0.95, 0.99.

)95.0,(nRPN > )95.0,(nRPE  for ≥n 28; 
)99.0,(nRPN > )99.0,(nRPE  for ≥n 31. Thus, 
compared to extreme value distribution, normal 
distribution seems to have a better performance 
in the covering probability for ≥p 0.20 and has 
a worse performance in the covering probability 
for p on the left tail when mis-specification is 
present. 
 
7. Conclusions 
 
This paper investigated the impact of 
mis-discrimination between lognormal and Weibull 
distributions on the interval estimation of a thp  
quantile for complete data. The expected widths 
and the covering probabilities of the confidence 
intervals with mis-specification are evaluated. The 
results indicate that for both distributions, the 
expected widths and the covering probabilities are 
significantly influenced by mis-specification. It is 
observed that: 
(1) For the data coming from an extreme value 
distribution, the CIs with mis-specification will 
be wider than those with correct specification 
for ≥p 0.5; while, the CIs with 
mis-specification will be narrower than those 
with correct specification for ≤p 0.4. 
(2) For the data coming from a normal distribution, 
the CIs with mis-specification will be wider 
than those with correct specification for 
≤p 0.6; while, the CIs with mis-specification 
will be narrower than those with correct 
specification for ≥p 0.7. 
(2) For fixed n, ),( pnRWN  is decreasing with p. 
In addition, for all n, ),( pnRWN > 1 for 
≤p 0.6; while ),( pnRWN <1 for ≥p 0.7. 
(3) For both normal and extreme value distributions, 
the impact of mis-specification between normal 
and extreme value distributions on the expected 
widths of CIs becomes alleviative for 
sufficiently large n. 
(4) For the data coming from an extreme value 
distribution, the covering probabilities are 
significantly influenced by mis-specification. 
Similarly, for the data coming from a normal 
distribution, the covering probabilities are also 
significantly influenced by mis-specification 
except for p nearby 0.6. 
(5) Wholly, compared to extreme value distribution, 
normal distribution seems to have a better 
performance in the covering probability for 
≥p 0.20 and has a worse performance in the 
covering probability for p on the left tail when 
mis-specification is present.

sampling plan policy. Now there are many related researches on CSP-1 such as Resnikoff (1960) proposed in minimum 
average inspection fraction for a continuous sampling plan. Chen & Chou (2002) studied the inspection method under 
linear inspection cost model to decide the minimum total expected cost. Govindaraju & Kandasamy (2000) proposed 
the modified CSP-1 plan, which is based on single level continuous sampling plan with the acceptance number. The 
modified plan is similar to CSP-1 but differs in inspection process; it has an acceptance number of defectives and will 
shift into 100% inspection when exceeds this limit. The advantage of this plan is to achieve a reduction in the average 
fraction inspected at good quality levels. Chen & Chou (2004) considered the minimum average fraction inspected (AFI) 
for Govindaraju & Kandasamy’s (2000) modified CSP-1 plan. They developed a solution procedure to find the CSP-1 
parameters that will meet the AOQL requirement, while also minimizing the AFI for the modified CSP-1 plan when the 
process average is known.  
Most studies mentioned earlier have been operated under assumption of error-free. However, normal inspection 
may have errors that can decrease the outgoing quality. Traditional continuous sampling plan assumes that there is no 
inspection error. In fact, there are two types of inspection errors: type I and II. Type I error occurs when the good 
products get classified as defectives that will be destroyed or reworked. This error can lead to increase in the production 
cost and is also known as the producer's risk. Type II error happens when the defectives are classified as non-defectives 
and are allowed for shipment. This type of error can affect customer’s loyalty and is known as consumer's error. 
Presence of inspection error in CSP-1 plan was first discussed in Case et al. (1973) that mentioned the need of an 
alternate sampling method. Case et al. (1973) developed a compensating sampling plan, considering inspection errors, 
which yield the desired actual AOQL. Endres (1979) then discussed the minimum AFI plan in case of inspection error. 
Wang & Chen (1997) further modified Endres’s (1979) method and formulated a minimum average fraction inspection 
model under inspection error. 
In some situations, some machinery parts are prohibited to have defectives, such as vehicle brake system, radar 
homing system, air defense system, etc. For such parts, a great fine or a high return cost will be put on the purchase 
contract. Thus, it is an important topic for producers to effectively screen out the defectives. Haji & Haji (2004) has 
employed a renewal reward process on CSP-1 to develop optimal policies in terms of the clearance number. The results 
show three different optimal policies:  
(1) Under higher return cost condition, performing CSP-1 100% inspection. 
(2) Under lower return cost, performing a partial inspection but no continuous inspection. 
(3) If the return cost is a constant, the clearance number can be any value. 
Although the articles above mentioned the sampling plan with inspection failure or the returned cost, in 
continuous sampling plan, there is no related study. The purpose of this paper is to determine the optimal policy of 
CSP-1 with inspection errors and return cost. In addition, we employ the method of “precise inspection,” which could 
almost 100% screen out defectives. An example of the “precise inspection” can be seen in finding faults on ball grid 
array (BGA). BGA is a packaging for surface-mounted integrated electronic circuit and is sometimes very difficult to 
look for faults. By using X-ray, it can almost 100% screens out defectives but is costly. As mentioned, having a precise 
inspection can be costly, so, in how to reach the perfect balance in the inspection effect and the cost, will be a valuable 
discussion question. Thus, this paper will focus on finding CSP-1 optimal policies under inspection error and return cost 
while adopting the concept of precise inspection.   
   This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly describes the layout of CSP-1 inspection process, discusses 
the sampling techniques with presence of the inspection error, the concept of renewal reward process and introduces the 
optimal net profit model. Section 3 shows the derivation of the optimal net profit model. Section 4 gives a numerical 
example to demonstrate the optimal policy. Finally, Section 5 gives the conclusion. 
2. OPTIMAL POLICY 
In this section, we will introduce the concept of CSP-1 inspection process and the renewal process and proposes the 
optimal model.  
 
2.1.  CSP-1 Introduction 
The procedure of CSP-1 is as follows (Dodge, 1943): 
1 1n
qV q
p f
⎛ ⎞∗ = ∗ −⎜ ⎟⎝ ⎠  
 
and 
 
                                        
1 1nV p f
∗ = −                                         (9) 
2.2 CSP-1 and inspection error 
Normally, all inspections have inspection errors - type I (non-defectives are classified as defectives) and type II 
(defectives are classified as non-defectives). In the CSP-1 process, under type I error α, as known from Equation (1), 
the number of non-defectives classified as defectives in step 1 is:  
 
1 i
d i
qU
q
α α ⎛ ⎞−∗ = ∗⎜ ⎟⎝ ⎠  
 
In step 2, the number of non-defectives classified as defectives is: 
 
1dVα α α∗ = ∗ =  
 
Thus, number of non-defectives classified as defectives in a cycle is: 
 
1 1i
d d i i
qU V
q q
α α α α α−∗ + ∗ = + =  
 
So, as known from Equation (6), under type II error β, the number of defectives mistaken to be non-defectives in step 1 
is: 
1 1 1
i
g i
qU

In step 2, the number of defectives mistaken to be non-defectives is: 
 
1 1gV p
β β ⎛ ⎞∗ = ∗ −⎜ ⎟⎝ ⎠  
 
Thus, the total number of defectives mistaken to be non-defectives in step 1 and step 2 is: 
 
1 11 1

g g i
qU V

Let W to be the number of products produced until time t. Since there are defectives and inspection errors in CSP-1, 
the actual sold products may be less than W. If the profit earned, after subtracting different cost, is P(W), the net unit 
profit for W number of products is: 
 
( ) ( )P WNP W
W
=  
 
therefore, we know, from the property of a renewal process, that (see Ross, 1993) 
 
Let R and TC to be expected income and expected total cost. The expected profit P is 
 
P=R-TC 
 
The net profit can be written as:

Then we will base on the ten scenarios listed above, under different cost condition, establishing cost functions and 
deciding the best sampling policy. 
In this case, the CSP-1 determined defectives will go through a precise inspection, and the mistaken products will 
not be discarded. There will be no opportunity cost, but there is a precise inspection cost. The CSP-1 determined 
non-defectives and non-inspected products will have a r1 and r2 proportion precise inspection that will give a precise 
inspection cost. However, the portion that does not have the precise inspection may contain defectives, which leads to 
return cost. Overall, the expected total cost includes (1) expected precise inspection cost, (2) expected return cost, (3) 
expected inspection cost and (4) expected production cost. These four costs are discussed below:
