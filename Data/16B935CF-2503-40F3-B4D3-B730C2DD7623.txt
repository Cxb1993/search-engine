1.  Abstract 
A BIST diagnosis technique is presented to 
diagnose multiple errors in multiple scan chains.  
An LFSR randomly selects outputs of multiple 
scan chains every scan cycle.  The column parity 
and row parity of the selected scan outputs are 
observed every scan cycle and every scan unload, 
respectively.  Compared with other techniques, 
which diagnose no more than 15% errors, CPRS 
correctly diagnoses all errors in the presence of 
1% unknowns.  The cost of this technique is area 
overhead and one additional output observed 
every scan cycle. 
2.  CPRS Diagnosis  
The CPRS hardware architecture is shown in 
figure 1.  The scan outputs from m scan chains 
are randomly selected by the row selection LFSR 
(RS-LFSR) every scan cycle.  The row selection 
hardware is made up of m AND gates.  After the 
row selection hardware, the scan outputs are 
XORed together to produce one bit of CP, which 
is observed every scan cycle in the diagnosis 
mode. The selected scan outputs are also XORed 
with its own RP, which is accumulated in the row 
parity register.  The row parity register is chained 
into a scan chain and it is shifted out after all l 
scan cells are unloaded.  The RP chain is not 
drawn in the figure for clarity.  All the scan 
chains, RS-LFSR, and RP registers are clocked by 
the same scan clock.  The overall CPRS 
diagnosis flow is shown in figure 2.  The CPRS 
diagnosis flow can be divided into two phases:  
the random diagnosis and the deterministic 
diagnosis.  The failed CUT is first diagnosed by 
the random diagnosis.  After the random 
diagnosis, if a unique diagnosis result is obtained, 
the flow is terminated.  Otherwise, the failed 
CUT continues to the deterministic diagnosis.  
The random diagnosis and deterministic diagnosis 
are described in detail as follows.

3.  Calculation Methods 
 The failing scan chains and failing scan cells 
are represented by error bits in an error matrix.  
In the error matrix, every row corresponds to a 
scan chain and every element corresponds to a 
scan cell.  A one in error bit Ei,j  means that the 
Figure 4 summarizes the whole flow to solve 
the error bits. It is not always the case that every 
error bit can be solved in the random diagnosis.  
If an error bits is uniquely solved, its diagnosis 
result is unique; otherwise, its diagnosis result is 
ambiguous.

Figure 5 shows an example of ambiguous 
diagnosis.  The number of error bits is seven but 
only six equations are available.  After the 
Gauss-Jordan elimination, the CM is converted to 
a form of (D|U).  The upper part of D is an 
identity matrix and the lower part of D, if any, is 
all zeros.  If the U matrix is free of ones, a 
unique solution is obtained; otherwise the 
diagnosis result is ambiguous.  In this example, 
only one error bit E1,3 is uniquely solved and the 
other error bits remain ambiguous.  To diagnose 
the ambiguous error bits, at least one deterministic 
diagnosis is needed.

4.  Experimental Results 
Experimental results are shown to 
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed 
CPRS technique. Each of the following 
experiment is performed on 10,000 randomly 
generated error matrices with various error 
multiplicities. The errors are assumed to be 
uniformly distributed in the error matrices. In the 
first experiment, a total of one thousand scan cells 
are partitioned into 10 scan chains (i.e., m = 10 
and l = 100).  Table 1 shows the average number 
of correctly diagnosed bits, wrong bits, and 
ambiguous bits.  If a bit is uniquely solved, its 
diagnosis result is either correct or wrong, 
depending on whether the solution is the same as 
the original error matrix.  If a bit is not uniquely 
solved, its diagnosis result is ambiguous. As the 
number of random diagnosis sessions increases, 
the number of correctly diagnosed bits increases.  
After fifteen random diagnosis sessions and one 
deterministic diagnosis, every bit is correctly 
diagnosed even in the presence of 15 errors (1.5% 
of total scan cells).
