Abstract 
 
In this experiment, a radio frequency 
dual ion beam sputtering (DIBS) system was 
used to prepare AlN films with different 
bottom electrode, such as Mo, Ni and Ti, on a 
Si (100) substrate.   After   systematic   
testing of processing  variables,   a   high   
quality   film   with   preferred   c-axis 
orientation  was  grown  successfully  on  
Si  (100)  substrate  with  Al  target  
under 700 eV energy flux, N2 / (N2+Ar) ratio 
of 59% and 4x10-4 torr in vacuum. Generally 
AlN films prepared by DIBS are decided by 
electrode material structure and property.  
The characteristics of the deposited AlN 
thin film were studied by X-Ray Diffraction 
(XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscope  
(TEM). 
Key words: DIBS; AlN film; preferred

Introduction 
AlN film has a wide application in 
microelectronic devices because of its high 
thermal conductivity, high electrical resistivity 
and attractive mechanical properties [1]. In 
addition, AlN film is a candidate material of 
UV light emitter by the wide band gap energy 
[2,3]. Its fast acoustic velocity (5600m/s) is 
crystallization of AlN films preference to 
(002) orientation in using a bottom Mo 
electrode is better than Ti/Ni bottom 
electrode in condition of substrate 
heating at 300O C. The AlN films 
deposited at sputtering energy flux 700 ev in 
condition of the same nitrogen dens (59%) is 
excellence for among of Ti, Ni and Mo bottom 
electrode. This effects is  due  to  the  
deposition  rate  is  so  rapid  that  the  
atoms have  not  enough  time  to  
migrate  or  without  suitable energy to 
remove to the equilibrium positions before 
the next  layer  of  atoms  arrive  [13] 
except above condition.  The crystallization 
of AlN films deposited at the sputtering 
energy flux in 700 eV is poor in spite of the 
nitrogen dens is 59% (Figs. 1 and 2). It is 
illustration the sensitivity of  AlN  film  
deposition  for nitrogen dens. In addition, the 
AlN film deposition is also sensitivity of 
bottom electrode and temperature. 
The microstructure analyses of the films 
were examined by TEM Figs. 3-5 shows the 
cross-section of film pattern at energy flux of 
700 eV, the 59% N2 concentration.  The AlN 
film with a bottom Ti electrode which deposit at 
room temperature is showed in Fig. 3.  We can 
be seen clearly that shape of arc-like patterns 
indicating the tendency of epitaxy growth. 
The electron diffraction determines the AlN 
(100), (002) and (101). The bright field image 
(3b) and dark field image (3c) exhibit highly 
textured with c-axis oriented perpendicular to 
the substrate surface. However, the AlN film 
with a bottom Ni electrode which deposit at room 
temperature is showed in Fig. 4. It is reveal the 
AlN film with (002) orientation texture is less than 
Fig.3. For substrate heating at 300O C condition, 
the AlN film with a bottom Mo electrode which is 
showed in Fig. 5.  We can be seen clearly that 
shape of arc-like patterns almost transferred 
to spot which indicating the tendency of 
highly texture growth. The bright field image 
(5b) and dark field image (5c) exhibit highly 
textured with c-axis oriented more strong 
than Fig. 3. Compare the AlN deposition with 
a Ti, Mo or Ni electrode and with a bottom Al 
electrode, the difference is no amorphous 
structure layer near the electrode (Figs.3-5). 
 
Conclusions  
Aluminum nitride nanometer crystals were 
deposited on Si (100) substrates using the 
dual ion beam sputtering deposition (DIBSD) 
system with different bottom electrodes. The 
highly textured with c-axis oriented AlN films 
can be synthesized at 700 eV energy flux, 
room temperature and 59% N2 concentration 
using Al for optimal piezoelectric materials. 
Based on  this  study,  it  was observed 
that  (1)  for  room  temperature, the AlN films 
deposited with a bottom Ti electrode is better 
than with a bottom Mo/Ni electrode; (2) for
