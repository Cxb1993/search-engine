series definition. Section 3, we present a new definition for forecasting enrollments with
fuzzy time series based on Lee and Chou’s method, our method is also evaluated in section 4.
Finally, the conclusions are made in section 5.
2. Fuzzy sets and Fuzzy time series
In 1965, Zadeh [11] introduced some basic concepts and terminology of “Fuzzy Sets”. It 
makes the start of a scientific revolution related to uncertainty, and the effects of which are
still being explored. In 1978, Dubios and Prade [3] defined the fuzzy number as a fuzzy
subset of the real line. In 1975, Zadeh [12, 13, 14] introduced fuzzy arithmetic theory and its
application.
Definition 2.1 A fuzzy number in real line is a fuzzy subset of  that is normal and
convex.
The fuzzy time series was first presented by Song and Chissom [7, 8]. There are a
number of calculation methods to determine the fuzzy relation. Different methods will yield
different results [2, 10]. In their papers, they followed Mamdani’s method [5] to determine the
relations. The main difference between the fuzzy time series and traditional time series is that
the values of the former are fuzzy sets while the values of the latter are real historical numbers.
The definitions of fuzzy time series are reviewed as follows.
Definition 2.2 [2, 3] Let )(tY ( ,0,1,2, )t  , a subset of, be the universe of discourse on
which fuzzy sets )(tf i ( 1, 2, )i  are defined and )(tF is the collection of )(tf i ( 1, 2, )i  .
Then )(tF is called a fuzzy time series on )(tY ( ,0,1,2, )t  .
)(tF can be understood as a linguistic variable and )(tf i ( 1, 2, )i  as the possible
linguistic values of )(tF . Because at different times, the values of )(tF can be different,
)(tF is a function of time t . Also, since the universes of discourse can be different at different
times, )(tY is used for the universe at time t .
Definition 2.3 [2, 3] Let I and J be indices sets for ( 1)F t and ( )F t respectively. If for
any ( ) ( )
j
f t F t where j J , there exists ( 1) ( 1)
i
f t F t   where Ii such that there exists a
fuzzy relation ( , 1)

then )(tF is said to be caused by )1( tF only. Denote this as )()1( tftf ii  or equivalently
)()1( tFtF  .
Definition 2.4 [2, 3] If for any ( ) ( )jf t F t where Jj , there exists ( 1) ( 1)if t F t   where
normal distribution, that is, if Z is )1,0(N distribution then   )( zZP .
Definition 2.10 [4] Assume there are m linguistic values under consideration. Let iA be
the fuzzy number that represents the ith linguistic value of the linguistic variable
where mi1 . The support of iA is defined to
be

3. A new definition for forecasting with fuzzy time series
In the following, we propose a new definition to forecast by fuzzy time series. Generally, our
method is a modification of the method proposed by Lee and Chou [4]. We add a new
definition is more complete than Lee and Chou method due to the fact that we define stability
concept of the fuzzy time series that represent the increase and the decrease case more
appropriately.
In this article, we apply difference test to understand whether information are in stable state. If
the information location is in unstable state, do the second difference to divide and continue
assaying, recursion until the information are in stable state again.
Let d(t) –d(t-1) is difference value, d(t) is tth historical data, d(t-1) is (t-1)th historical data
respectively.
Definition 3.1 For test 0 :H non fuzzy trend against 1 :H fuzzy trend , the test given by
( ( ) ( 1)) 1 ,
( ( 1) ( )) 1 ,
( ( ) ( 1)) ( ( 1) ( )) 0.5,
0 0.5.

value vale is 0.2 or 0.3. This initial value is stricter if the value is near 0.5. Let k is the
number of differential.
According to the above definition for fuzzy time series, a procedure analysis can tell us not
only the appropriate forms for the fuzzy time series model, but may also provide us with good
estimates of the numerical value of its trend. These definitions can be checked by the analysis
of the fuzzy time series model. Figure 1 summarizes the iterative approach to fuzzy time
series model, building for procedure and control, which is employed in this article.
Following the definition of 2.10, define iA by letting its membership function

4. Forecasting history data with our method
We verify our method by forecasting the container throught by harbors in Taiwan area from
1973 to 2003 as shown in Table 1.
Step 1:
Let )(td be the history data under consideration and )(tF be the fuzzy time series. Difference
test to understand whether information are in stable state according to definition 3.1.,
recursion until the information are in stable state again.

5. Conclusions
In this article, we add a useful definition to improve original method [4] to forecast the cargo
throughput based on fuzzy time series. From the illustrative example, we can see that our
definition not only define the trend of the fuzzy numbers that represent the linguistic values of
the linguistic variable more appropriately, but also can make the RMSPE smaller. In summary,
our method is as accurate as Lee and Chou method [4] but more reasonable in forecasting
container throughput of harbors in Taiwan area.
