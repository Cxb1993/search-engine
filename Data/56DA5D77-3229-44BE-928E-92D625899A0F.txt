Abstract 
 
 Single-phase CuAlO2 films were successfully prepared by thin-film reaction of an 
Al2O3/Cu2O/sapphire sandwich structure. We found that the processing parameters, such as heating 
rate, holding temperature and annealing ambient, were all crucial to form CuAlO2 without second 
phases. Thermal annealing in pure oxygen ambient with a lower temperature ramp rate might result 
in the formation of CuAl2O4 in addition to CuAlO2, since part of Cu2O was oxidized to form CuO 
and caused the change in reaction path, i.e. CuO + Al2O3 →  CuAl2O4. Typical annealing 
conditions successful to prepare single-phase CuAlO2 would be to heat the sample with a 
temperature rampt rate higher than 7.3
o
C/sec and hold the temperature at 1100
o
C in air ambient. 
The formation mechanism of CuAlO2 has also been studied by interrupting the reaction after a short 
period of annealing. TEM observations showed that the top Al2O3 layer with amorphous structure 
reacted immediately with Cu2O to form CuAlO2 in the early stage and then the remaining Cu2O 
reacted with the sapphire substrate.

1. Introduction 
  
 Recently, wide bandgap oxide semiconductors have attracted much attention for their 
applications in optoelectronic devices such as UV diodes [1], gas sensors [2], transparent thin film 
transistors [3] and photovoltaic devices [4].  To form all oxide semiconductor devices, an oxide 
material with p-type conductivity is necessary.  A few p-type oxide semiconductors have been 
identified, including CuAlO2 [5], SrCu2O2 [6], LaCuOSe [7] and As-doped ZnO [8].  Among them, 
CuAlO2 is a good candidate because of its p-type conductivity without intentional doping and the 
abundance of the constituent elements.  However, the preparation of single-phase CuAlO2 is 
difficult when using various film deposition techniques.  Second phases such as Cu2O, Al2O3 and 
CuAl2O4 were found in the CuAlO2 films grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [9] and 
reactive sputtering [10]. 
 CuAlO2 can be formed by the reaction of Cu2O and Al2O3 at a temperature as high as 1000
o
C 
according to the Cu2O-Al2O3 pseudo-binary phase diagram.  Based on this idea, we have 
successfully developed a simple and reproducible method to prepare single-phase CuAlO2 films by 
rapid thermal annealing of an Al2O3/Cu2O/sapphire sandwich structure [11].  In this article, we 
describe how to prepare CuAlO2 without second phase with suitable annealing conditions. In 
addition, formation mechanism of CuAlO2 has also been studied.

C 14. For the specimen prepared by the use of a heating rate of 7.3oC/sec, only two peaks 
identified to be (006) and (009) of CuAlO2 is observed.   
Thus, according to the experiment on annealing in different ambients and at different 
temperature ramp rates, the rapid ramp rate prevents Cu2O to be oxidized to CuO during 
temperature increase and avoids the formation of CuAl2O4.  
In addition to XRD, the identification of second phases was also done by XPS where the 
variation of binding energy (BE) between second phases and CuAlO2 can be detected. Figure 3 
shows that no satellite peak (“shake up” peak at around 943 eV) of Cu 2p1/2 and Cu 2p3/2 
(BE = 952.3 eV and 932.5 eV after calibration using the C 1s position of carbon, respectively) can 
be detected, indicating the absence of Cu
+ II
 related features 15,16. According to XPS database 
17, the 2p3/2 peaks of Cu0 and Cu+I (Cu2O) are near to 932.7 eV, where the 2p
3/2 
peak of Cu
+II
 
(CuO) is located at 933.8 eV. The LMM Auger transition of Cu shows only one peak at 336.8 eV, 
which is assigned to Cu
+ I
 (335 eV for Cu
0
, 335.5 eV for Cu
+II
 in CuO, and 336.4-337.4 eV for Cu
+I
 
in Cu2O). This analysis shows the presence of solely + I oxidation state of copper in the film. 
The interfacial structure of a fully reacted sample without any detectable second phase was 
observed in a TEM. This sample was prepared by rapid thermal annealing (heating rate: 7.3
o
C/sec) 
at 1100
o
C in air for 60 min. Figure 4 shows a high-resolution TEM lattice image revealed the 
CuAlO2/(0001)sapphire interface. The lattice images were taken along 11 2 0sapphire and 101
0sapphire zone axis, respectively. We see that the (0001) basal plane of the CuAlO2 layer is parallel to 
the (0001) basal plane of sapphire. There is no grain boundary or other planar defect found in the 
CuAlO2 layer. Figure 5 (b) shows stripe lines of ions at intervals of 5.64 Å  parallel to the interface. 
The interval corresponds to one third of the c-axis lattice constant of CuAlO2 and the distance 
between Cu layers. These results indicate that CuAlO2 grows epitaxially on sapphire (0001). The 
lattice mismatch between CuAlO2 and sapphire is as large as 4%. The reason why hetero-epitaxial 
growth occurs for oxides with large lattice misfit is explained in terms of the high ionicity of the 
chemical bonds in oxides. 18 
To study the formation mechanism of CuAlO2, we intend to lower the annealing temperature 
and interrupt the annealing process and exam the partially reacted sample. Three samples were 
prepared by thermal annealing in air ambient with a temperature ramp rate of 7.3
o
C/sec and kept at 
1000
o
C for 5 min, 10 min and 60 min. XRD analysis indicates that the peaks related to Cu2O, Al2O3 
(its structure is originally amorphous but then it crystallizes after annealing) and CuAlO2 are 
identified in a specimen annealed at 1000
o
C for 5 minutes, see Fig. 5. It is clear that polycrystalline 
CuAlO2 forms but still has a considerable amount of Cu2O and a small amount of Al2O3 left 
un-reacted.  
Cross-sectional TEM image as shown in Fig. 6(a) verifies the XRD result. Since the Cu2O 
layer is much thicker than the Al2O3 layer, there should be some Cu2O left after the consumption of 
the entire Al2O3 layer. A simple calculation indicates that the thickness of the CuAlO2 layer and the 
remaining Cu2O layer are 200 nm and 390 nm, respectively. These values have a close match with
