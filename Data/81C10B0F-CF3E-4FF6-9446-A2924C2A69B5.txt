Abstract 
An energy parameter based on the 
concept of the M-integral is to be presented 
for describing the fracture behavior of a 
multi-cracked solid subjected to 
nonconservative and nonuniform crack 
surface tractions.  By using the M-integral 
with a suitably chosen closed contour, one 
can evaluate the surface energy required for 
creation of the stressed cracks.  Also, it is to 
be demonstrated that the property of 
path-independence holds even under the 
action of crack surface tractions.  Therefore, 
the singular stress field in the near-tip areas 
is not directly involved in the calculation so 
that a complicated finite element model 
around the crack tips is not required in 
evaluation of the M-integral.  The 
applicability of the presented approach is to 
be illustrated for use in assessment of 
material integrity due to presence of multiple 
stressed cracks.

二、Introduction 
For engineering structures containing 
multiple distributed cracks, the local stress 
state in the near-tip region becomes quite 
complicated and difficult to describe.  In 
such a case, the use of energy parameters in 
describing the 'global' fracture state of the 
multi-cracked fracture state is therefore of 
practical interest.  The well-known energy 
conservation contour integrals derived from 
Noether's theorem in plane elasticity include 
the Jk-, M-, and L-integrals (Knowles and 
Sternberg (1972), Budiansky and Rice (1973).  
Among them, the Jk-integrals (k=1,2) have 
widely been used as energy fracture 
parameters for single-cracked problems.  
Physically, Jk evaluate the energy release 
rates related to crack extension in 
quasi-brittle materials.  Nevertheless, the 
Jk-integrals are not suitable for use in 
characterizing the multi-cracked energy state

Again, by definition, the integration is 
performed by taking the limiting case in 
which the portions of Dr are shrunk onto the 
crack tips and lying along the crack surfaces.  
Also, while the value of M varies with 
respect to different selections of origin O, the 
result of M appears to be invariant with 
respect to the orientation of the coordinate 
system. 
 
四、Path-independence for M-integral  
As described, the integration is carried 
out by taking the limiting case where the 
portions of contour are shrunk onto the crack 
tips and the crack surfaces.  When the 
problems are solved by using numerical 
schemes such as finite element method, the 
discretized solutions will in general describe 
the behavior around the crack front more or 
less accurately, depending on the degree of 
local grid refinement and/or the adoption of 
special singular elements.  Therefore, direct 
calculation of the M-integral appears to be 
difficult.   
While the property of 
path-independence for the M-integral has 
been established for problems containing 
multiple traction-free cracks (e.g., Chen 
(2001)). the validity of this property still 
needs to be investigated when the cracks are 
subjected to surface tractions.  This property 
is thus to be established in this research. 
To this end, we first take an outer 
contour Do (Figure 2) that can be arbitrarily 
chosen (except for the requirements to be 
inside the body, enclose all the N cracks, and 
contain no other singularity in it).  Then, by 
introducing the pairs of cut paths Lr+ and Lr– 
(r=1,..,N), which coincides with each other 
asymptotically, and delimiting the closed 
contour C=(
r1
N
 Dr+Lr++Lr–)–Do. Further, 
we consider the simply-connected region A 
enclosed by C.  By applying divergence 
theorem in A and taking the constitutive 
relation under the state of equilibrium, the 
M-integral can be shown to be 
path-independent, i.e., the integral can be 
carried out along any outer contour Do, with 
the result remaining unchanged.  With this 
property, the integration contour can be more 
easily defined with no need to accommodate 
the complex geometry of the set of cracks.  
 
五、Origin-Independence for M 
    Since the position vector x is included 
in the M-integral, the result of this 
integration thus in general varies with the 
selection of origin O.  Nevertheless, we 
consider the condition corresponding to the 
special situation when the N distributed 
traction-free cracks are located in an infinite 
medium and subjected to uniform remote 
loads. Under such a homogeneously-stressed 
condition, also termed material characteristic, 
the integral appears to be origin-independent.  
As to the condition when the cracks are 
subjected to surface tractions, it is shown that 
the M-integral appears to be equivalent to 
that evaluated with respect to another point 
and so the validity of this property is 
illustrated.  
 
六、Physical Interpretation 
In order to illustrate the physical 
meaning of the M-integral, we consider a 
single crack with two tips P and Q and of 
length l, we arbitrarily choose an 
intermediate state during the process of its 
evolution, as shown in Figure 3.   
At this stage, the crack is instantly 
terminated at, say, point Pe and is of length a.  
Note that, the surface traction Tc is not 
present until the crack surfaces are created 
due to its nonconservative nature.  In Figure 
4, the portion of the crack that remains to be 
formed and the corresponding to-be-present 
surface tractions are depicted in dashed lines.  
The associated energy release rate G, due to a 
unit advance at the point Pe along the 
original direction of the crack segment, can 
be expressed as decrease of the strain energy  
We further define an extended 
configuration relative to the intermediate 
state.  In this extended state, all material 
points on (and within) e, C1e, and C2e are 
translated by da along the crack surfaces, 
with all other points remaining in their 
original positions.  We also assume that 
there exists a one-to-one invertible 
coordinate mapping between the intermediate 
and its extended states.  Also, during the 
continuously varying process of crack 
evolution, the far-field uniform loads are
