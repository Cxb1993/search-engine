Synthesis, characterization and application of multiferroic materials 
(NSC 96-2628-E-006 -010-MY3) 
 
Abstract 
 In this three-year project, various routes of preparing high-quality BiFeO3 (BFO) films were 
attempted. Systematic studies have led to a good understanding of the film growth mechanisms and 
the key factors affecting ferroelectric properties were identified. BFO films with nearly perfect 
ferroelectric loops and large remanent polarisations (64 C/cm2) have been grown by the RF 
magnetron sputtering deposition, which is a cheap and the preferred method for the large-area 
commercial coatings. Piezoresponse force microscopy confirmed that the sputtered BFO films 
could be poled and switched by a small DC bias, i.e. they were electrically writable. The films of 
good ferroelectric properties also showed a smooth surface suitable for subsequent growth of 
ferromagnetic films and therefore were ready for the exploration of device applications. Ti and Mg 
co-doping reduced the BFO Neel temperature (TN) from 390 C to 263 C without deteriorating the 
ferroelectric properties. This allowed magnetic field annealing for the exchange bias to be 
performed at a much lower temperature, reducing the risk of chemical reaction at the interface. Thin 
films of the oxide ferrimagnet Zn1-xNixFe2O4 (ZNFO) were grown epitaxially on the BFO surface 
and a clear exchange bias was observed after field annealing through TN. An all-oxide spin valve 
multilayer architecture, ZNFO/Sr1-xLaxTiO3/ZNFO/BFO/LaNiO3/SrTiO3, has been fabricated, 
where La doped SrTiO3 was served as the spacer, LaNiO3 as the bottom electrode, and all the layers 
were grown epitaxially by the RF magnetron sputtering. Measurements of magnetoresistance and 
electrical control are in progress. Extensive searches for novel multiferroic materials were carried 
out. A dozen of single crystals of transition-metal doped, tetragonal-tungsten-bronze structured 
niobates have been grown by the spontaneous nucleation method, some of which were ferroelectric 
and showed some ordered magnetic structures. They are potentially multiferroic. Most of the 
specified tasks listed in the original proposal have been fulfilled. The project has produced four 
papers published in high ranking SCI journals (one of which is the first in its category) and another 
two submitted. Fourteen M.Sc. students have graduated with the financial support of this project, 
which allowed them to carry out necessary experiments.

method is apparently excluded by the chemical reaction at the interface owing to the high TN of 
BFO. The second method is also inapplicable because BFO has to grow at high temperature (>500 
C) to achieve a reasonable structure and ferroelectric property [17]. An alternative method was 
attempted by sputtering the Permalloy film on BFO at room temperature in a magnetic field and 
exchange bias was indeed observed [18,19]. However, the exchange coupling induced by such a 
way was weak and as a consequence, the achieved magnetoresistance was small and showed 
double peaks in the curve of resistance vs. magnetic field [18]. A potential solution for the problem 
is to find a suitable oxide ferromagnet that does not react easily with BFO at about 390 C, so the 
exchange bias may be induced more effectively by the conventional field annealing method.  
 
2. Objectives of the project 
 This three-year project was concerned with the synthesis, characterisation and application of 
multiferroic materials. In addition to the importance in the understanding of fundamental physics, 
the coexistence of ferroelectric and magnetic domains in a single material provides a brand-new 
platform for the designing of next-generation electronic devices beyond the reach of currently 
available materials. The interest in the multiferroic materials has been growing rapidly in recent 
years [3,20,21] and extensive researches are being carried out worldwide, regarding all aspects of 
the multiferroic materials, which may be categorised into the three areas as follows. First is the 
theoretical understanding of the interplays between the electrical and magnetic orderings in a 
single-phase material, second is the search for novel multiferroic materials or property modification 
of currently available materials, and third is the potential application of multiferroic materials in 
some new devices combining the dual functionalities of ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism. Our 
focus was on the second and third areas. The main objectives of the project were to (1) improve 
the ferroelectric and magnetic properties of the room-temperature multiferroic BFO, (2) 
search for novel multiferroic materials, and (3) explore the potential applications of 
multiferroic materials. 
    Details about the experiments that have been carried out to achieve the above objectives and 
the main results and conclusions are presented below.

    3.1 Synthesis of polycrystalline ceramic samples 
    Polycrystalline ceramic samples were prepared for the initial assessments of novel materials, 
 5
 3.3 Single crystal growth 
 In order to obtain high-purity samples of novel materials, single crystal growth was carried out 
by the spontaneous nucleation method. The majority of the works were on the TM-doped 
TTB-structured niobates, such as Ba6(TM)xNb10-xO30 (TM=Fe, Co, Mn; x=0.67-1.0), 
K6Fe3.0Nb9.6O30, etc. The single crystals were grown from the BaO-Nb2O5 solution with the 
Nb2O5:BaO ratio of 38:62, which was close to the binary eutectic point shown in the BaO-Nb2O5 
phase diagram [22]. This was intended to lower the melting temperature from ~1455 C at the 
stoichiometric Nb/Ba ratio to ~1320 C for the safe use of Pt crucible, as well as for less 
evaporation. The molar percentage of TM elements was relatively small and expected not to change 
the chemical phase relationship too much. A charge of about 20g was well mixed by dry ball 
milling for 48 hrs and then placed in a 40cc Pt crucible. The crystal growth was carried out in a 
MoSi2-heating tube furnace with the diameter of 10 cm. The charge was heated up in ambient air at 
the rate of 300 C/hr to form a liquid. After dwelling at 1380 C (in the case of Ba6(TM)xNb10-xO30 
crystals) for 24 hrs, the temperature was reduced slowly at 1 C/hr to 1320 C and then to room 
temperature at 200 C/hr. Small crystals with typical size of about 1 mm3 were obtained after the 
solidified mass was crushed out from the crucible. In some cases, dilute nitric acid solution was 
used to dissolve the flux, so that the crystals could be separated. 
    3.4 Structural, electrical, magnetic and optical characterisations  
 The structural, electrical, magnetic and optical properties of obtained samples were studied by 
a wide range of techniques including powder and single-crystal X-ray diffractions (XRD), energy 
dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron 
spectroscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), 
temperature-dependent DC transport measurements, dielectric response and ferroelectric hysteresis 
measurements, SQUID magnetometry, photoluminescence spectroscopy, UV-vis absorption, etc.  
 
4. Main results and discussion 
 4.1 Growth of epitaxial BFO films with optimised magnetoelectric properties    
 For any application exploiting the ferroelectric property of BFO films, a bottom electrode has 
to be grown on the insulating substrates such as STO. Except for the good conductivity, the 
electrode has to have a crystal structure compatible for the epitaxial growth of BFO. In this study, 
the oxide conductor LNO was chosen as the bottom electrode. After a systematic study, we were 
able to grow LNO films epitaxially either on STO or LAO substrates (Fig.1), which also showed a 
 7
the Bi2O3-Fe2O3 pseudo-binary system, which competed with the BFO phase within certain 
temperature and pO2 range. The second issue arose from the preferential evaporation of bismuth 
oxide because of its much higher vapour pressure compared to iron oxide. 
    The post-deposition annealing route was tried, because the deposition at room temperature 
could avoid the preferential loss of Bi and if the subsequent sintering time was short, the obtained 
films should have an accurate stoichiometry. However, although the experiments showed that the 
sintering time could be as short as 10 minutes at 650 C [17], the obtained films still exhibited a 
large leakage current. The cause was likely to come from the residual trace of the intermediate 
phases. Once they were formed during heating, it was very difficult to get rid off completely. In 
contrast, the films sputtered in-situ at high temperature were possible to avoid the intermediate 
phases completely by setting accurate thermodynamic parameters and using closely matched 
substrates that only favours the nucleation of the BFO phase [10,17]. The problem of the 
preferential evaporation loss of Bi was minimised by a fast deposition rate, typically around 5 
nm/min. The strategy to grow the BFO films of good ferroelectric property may be summarised as 
follows: using fast growth rate to achieve accurate stoichiometry for the BFO phase and at the same 
time, to avoid the formation of impurity phases associated with the fast growth by proper control of 
thermodynamic parameters such as pO2 and temperature, as well as proper selection of substrates. 
   The growth parameters were optimised not only for good ferroelectric properties but also for a 
smooth surface, which is required for the subsequent growth of a ferromagnetic layer for some 
device applications. AFM and PFM were carried out to observe the surface morphology and to 
visualize domain switching. Fig.3a is a representative AFM image of the BFO films, showing a 
dense and smooth surface with the rms roughness of about 2.0 nm, which is suitable for the 
subsequent growths. PFM images taken on the virgin surface without previous application of DC 
bias revealed very fine spontaneous domains, as those shown in the edge areas of Figs.3b and 3c. 
Under +/-10V DC bias, PFM confirmed that the domains could be poled and switched, as shown in 
the middle areas of Figs. 3b and 3c. 
 In addition to the ferroelectric properties, the dielectric responses of the grow BFO films were 
also studied. Theoretical analysis on the experimental data showed that the epitaxial BFO films 
grown on (001) LNO/STO had a low-frequency (~1 kHz) dielectric loss due to the DC conductivity 
and the interfacial polarisation at the electrodes, in addition to the intrinsic BFO relaxation at higher 
frequency (~0.5 MHz). For the polycrystalline BFO films on Pt/Si, the dominant contribution to 
dielectric loss was space charge polarisation at grain boundaries [23].

x=00.15), 
its previous investigations have been focused on the magnetic and magneto-optical properties. The 
study on the dielectric properties of YIG has been far less in comparison. In fact, a few recent 
works on the dielectric behaviors of YIG showed a similar dielectric anomaly as Tb3Fe5O12 and 
Lu3Fe5O12, which was the giant increase of dielectric constants with the temperature over -40 to 
300 C [27,28]. Therefore, the full potential of YIG has yet to be discovered and more studies are 
required. 
 Y3-xBixFe5O12 (x=0-1.0) compounds were prepared by the solid state sintering, which were 
confirmed to have a pure garnet phase by XRD (Fig.5). An increase of Curie temperature with the 
Bi concentration was observed. The coercivity was also increased with the Bi concentration and 
this was accompanied by a reduction of the saturation magnetisation, whose variation with 
temperature was found to follow the modified Bloch’s law, Ms(T) = Ms(0)(1-BT3/2-CT5/2), below 
220 K (Fig.6). The fitting with the experiment data showed an increased stiffness of the spin wave 
with the Bi substitution. Dielectric responses were measured over a wide frequency (Fig.7) and 
temperature (Fig. 8) range, which showed a large step-like increase of dielectric constants at the 
temperatures between 20200 C (rising with the Bi concentration of the samples). The dielectric 
responses at room temperature increased initially at low Bi concentration (x<0.4) and then

of BaFeNb9O30, Ba6CoNb9O30, Ba6Mn0.67Nb9.33O30, and K6Fe3.0Nb9.6O30, which were confirmed to 
be isostructural with TTB. The patterns were be indexed according to PDF #77-2433. In view of 
the limited sensitivity of XRD, which is typically about 1 at.%, it was very difficult to rule out the 
possible trace of secondary phases with confidence even for the samples shown to be “pure”, due to 
the complex composition of the TTB compounds. Indeed, the temperature-dependent magnetic 
susceptibility measurements showed very complicated patterns. In order to avoid the confusion

2+ [32]. For the single crystals of potassium iron niobate, EDS proposed the composition of 
K6Fe3.0Nb9.6O30, where Fe was in 2+.  
 Except for some differences in the relative intensities of the refection lines, the ground single 
crystal powders had the same XRD patterns as those shown in Fig.10, confirming that the grown 
crystals were of right phase. The fine structure of Ba6(TM)xNb10-xO30 (TM=Fe and Co) was 
determined by the X-ray single crystal diffraction using the SHELXTL programs included in the 
Bruker-APEX2 software package and refined with full-matrix least squares. Both crystals have the 
tetragonal space group P4/mbm with the lattice parameters a=b=12.5895(3) Å, c=3.98910(10) Å for 
Ba6FexNb10-xO30 and a=b=12.634(4) Å, c=4.013(2) Å for Ba6CoxNb10-xO30. The atomic positions of 
both structures are shown in Table 2. The crystal size used for the structure determination was 
around 0.400.150.15 mm3 and more than 6000 reflections were collected, among which about 
500 were independent reflections. The final refinement index (R1) for all data was 0.0149, 
indicating that the calculated structure was reliable.  
 The structure refinement showed that the TM ions did not enter any of the three interstitial 
sites as we hoped for, but took the place of Nb instead. In the crystal structure of Ba6FexNb10-xO30, 
Fe ions occupied two crystallographic positions: 8% of 2(c) and 9% of 8(j). The best refinement 
gave the composition of the doped crystal as Ba6Fe0.90Nb9.10O30, confirming the Fe deficiency 
measured by EDS. According to the overall charge balance, the Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio in Ba6Fe0.90Nb9.10O30 
can be calculated to be 0.22/0.78, which is almost exactly the same as the ratio of Fe ions at the 
Wyckoff (c) and (j) positions, suggesting that Fe2+ may only dwell at (c), while Fe3+ is at (j). In the 
case of Ba6CoxNb10-xO30, the structure refinement showed that Co only occupied one 
crystallographic position at (j). 
 Magnetic properties of the grown crystals were characterised by the SQUID magnetometry. 
Shown in Fig.12 is the magnetisation vs. temperature (M-T) plot for Ba6FeNb9O30, which was 
 13
The temperature dependence of dielectric 
permittivity also revealed a dielectric anomaly with 
the peak permittivity at 300-310 C [33,34]. 
Therefore, Ba6FeNb9O30 is very likely to be 
ferroelectric, although Fig.15 itself alone is not 
sufficient to conclude. The space group P4/mbm is 
centrosymmetric, indicating that our as-grown 
crystals with 200 C/hr cooling to room 
temperature had the high temperature paraelectric 
phase and annealing below 300 C is necessary. 
The low temperature phase has the space group P4bm [34], distorted from P4/mbm. For the 
Ba6MnxNb10-xO30 compound, a relaxor-like behaviour was observed (Fig.16). The above results 
show a great potential of finding novel multiferroic materials, in particular room-temperature 
multiferroics, in the TTB-structured niobates.

 4.3 Exploration of potential applications of BFO   
 As explained in Section 2, a potential device exploiting the duo functionalities in BFO is the 
spin valve with BFO as the antiferromagnetic (AFM) pinning layer, where the high/low resistance 
states may be switched electrically via the coupling between the ferroelectric and magnetic domains. 
For such an application, a ferromagnetic (FM) layer 
has to be grown on top of BFO to establish an 
exchange bias at the FM-AFM interface. To avoid 
the chemical reaction at the interface, an oxide 
ferromagnet was preferred. After experiments with 
a number of oxide ferromagnets including 
La0.7Sr0.3MnO3, we decided to use Zn1-xNixFe2O4 
(ZNFO), which showed a fairly large saturation 
magnetisation (Ms) of 986 emu/cm3 and a small 
coercivity (Hc) of 37 Oe when x=0.30, and could be 
grown epitaxially on the BFO surface by RF 
magnetron sputtering. The proposed architecture 
for an all-oxide spin-valve is illustrated in Fig.17, 
where lanthanum doped STO (Sr1-xLaxTiO3) was

smaller than the bulk, in contrast to the expected 
increase due to the in-plane compressive strain, 
indicating an overall reduction of the unit cell 
volume. Similar phenomenon was previously 
observed for CoFe2O4 films grown on BFO by 
pulsed laser deposition [18]. This was probably 
caused by some stoichiometry difference 
between the bulk and thin film samples, in 
particular the oxygen contents, whose effect was 
already demonstrated above. In view of the 
much lower growth temperature for the films 
(600700 C), compared to the bulk sintering 
(>1000 C) [35], a higher oxygen content and therefore a smaller unit cell volume for the films may 
be expected.            
Fig.19 X-ray -2 scans of the epitaxial ZNFO thin 
films (20 nm) on a number of substrates: (a) (001) 
STO, (b) (001) LAO, (c) epitaxial LNO on STO, (d) 
epitaxial BFO on STO.
    Fig.20 shows the magnetisation vs. magnetic field (M-H) plots for the NZFO films grown on 
various substrates. The measured values of Mand Hc are summarized in Table 3. In general, Hc 
increases as the magnitude of misfit increases, varying from 31 Oe for the 150 nm thick 
polycrystalline films grown on Pt/Si, to 55 Oe and 155 Oe for the 20 nm thick epitaxial films grown 
on BFO/STO and LAO, respectively. Ms of the epitaxial films was reduced accordingly to about 
470 emu/cm3 from 986 emu/cm3 in the polycrystalline films. The films grown on LNO showed the 
highest Hc of 170 Oe and lowest Ms of 372 emu/cm3. 
    Spinel ferrites have the general formula MFe2O4, where M is a divalent metal ion. The crystal 
structure contains 8 formulas per unit cell, which is composed of 32 close-packed oxygen ions 
arranged in the similar way as the face-centered cubic lattice, where the M2+ and Fe3+ ions occupy 8 
of the 64 tetrahedral interstices (A site), plus 16 of the 32 octahedral interstices (B site). Exchange 
interaction between the A and B sites is antiferromagnetic and the net magnetic moment arises from 
the difference of the spins at the two sites. Normally, M2+ prefers B site because of a larger size 
than Fe3+, with Ni2+ being a typical example [36]. However, there are exceptions, such as Zn2+ and 
 17
in 17 has also been grown. Due to the very small change of lattice parameter for La-doped STO, its 
XRD looked almost the same as the trilayer: ZNFO/BFO/LNO/STO (Fig.22). The measurements of 
magnetoresistance and the control via electrical field are being carried out.  
Fig.22 XRD -2 scan of the trilayer: ZNFO/BFO/LNO/STO
In addition to the digital storage, BFO was also investigated for the potential photovoltaic 
applications [37]. Despite the leakage current problem that is often encountered in the studies of its 
ferroelectric properties, the conductivity of BFO is far too low for this type of applications. Proper 
doping to increase the conductivity may be necessary. Ni-doped BFO films were therefore prepared 
on quartz substrates by the sol-gel method. Photoluminescence and optical absorption measurements 
were then carried out. Four emissions at 451nm, 468nm, 513nm and 689nm were observed. The 
band-gap of the Ni-doped BFO was calculated from the absorption data to be 2.75 eV. The 
spectroscopic data were analysed in conjunction with the results of conductivity vs. temperature 
measurements, which showed three different kinds of activation energies related to the defect and 
dopant levels inside the band-gap. The observed emissions were attributed to the transitions from the 
oxygen vacancy, Bi2+ and Ni3+ levels, as well as the intrinsic band-to-band transition [38].

一、參加會議經過 
EuroMat series’ meetings held every two years are sponsored by the Federation of European 
Materials Societies. They have become prime venues in Europe for a major gathering of academics 
and industrialists with an interest in Materials Science and Technology. This year’s meeting was 
held in the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre (SECC), Glasgow, Scotland, UK, during 
Monday 7th to Thursday 10th September. It consisted of 6 symposiums covering 23 topics, among 
which the following topics were of particular interest to me: “Magnetic Materials”, “Electronic and 
Photonic Materials”, “Functional Ceramic Materials and Devices”, “Materials for Energy in a 
Sustainable Society”, “Coatings and Surface Engineering”, “Microstructural Characterisation 
Techniques”, etc.  
 
There were eight plenary speakers from famous institutions or industries around Europe, including 
University of Cambridge (UK), IFW Dresden (Germany), CSIC Madrid (Spain), University of 
Liverpool (UK), voestalpine Stahl GmbH (Austria), FOM-Institute AMOLF (Holland), SIMAP 
Grenoble-INP (France), and Max Planck Institute (Germany). They each presented a wonderful 
review about the most important achievements in the field of Materials Science during the past two 
years or so. In addition, about forty-five keynote lectures were given by the well-established 
materialists around world, to have in-depth discussions of recent discoveries and future perspectives 
in various areas of Materials Sciences.         
 
My 20 minute talk on “Growth and Characterisation of Multiferroic Thin Films for Spintronic 
Applications” was given at 11:20am on Wednesday 9 September 2009. It was presented in the 
Symposium A24: “Multiferroic Materials”, which had two sections each in the Morning and 
Afternoon on Wednesday.   
 
for making electrically switchable spintronic devices, than using the multiferroic materials, which is 
the project that we are currently working on. 
 
Another talk relevant to my research was given by Prof. Novak from the Institute of Physics ASCR, 
Czech, on the synthesis and characterisation of the hexaferrite Ba0.5Sr1.5Zn2Fe12O22, which was a 
recently discovered multiferroic compound. There are very few multiferroic materials existing in 
nature and therefore, it is always interesting to know any new compound being identified. However, 
this new compound seems to have several problems hindering it from being of practical use. First is 
the electrical conductivity, which increases with increasing temperature, limiting the region where 
the electric polarization is observed to T < 130 K. The second problem is that the magnetoelectricity 
is rather sensitive to the conditions of the crystal growth. Nevertheless, it provides a new sample for
