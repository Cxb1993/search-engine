二、報告內容 
(1)前言 
Analog signal amplification in 
discrete-time system can be performed by 
switched-capacitor amplifiers [1]. 
Switched-capacitor amplifier has been used in 
the design of digital-to-analog converter [2]. 
The schematic for the switched-capacitor 
amplifier is shown in Fig. 1. Assuming an 
infinite operational amplifier (op amp) gain, 
the output voltage at the end of 2  is given 
by

again independent of the op amp input offset 
voltage. During the reset phase ( 1 ), 3C  is 
connected in feedback around the op amp 
which causes the output to change only by the 
op amp input offset voltage. The switches are 
realized as CMOS transmission gates. For low 
supply voltages, a conductance gap begins to 
appear around the middle of the supply range 
[3]. This means that under low-voltage 
operation, this configuration no longer works. 
Several low-voltage switched-capacitor 
amplifiers have been reported, but all are 
implemented in a high-threshold voltage 
(high- thV ) process [4], [5]. Previous works 
mainly tackled the realization of low-voltage 
analog circuits using high- thV  devices, and 
consequently the issue in charge-based analog 
circuits was high resistance of MOS switches. 
To reduce on-state resistance, gates of MOS 
switches are widened or higher voltages are 
applied by bootstrap. 
While moving into ultra-deep submicron 
CMOS technologies, for low-voltage 
low-power designs, certain advantages can be 
gained. On the other hand, some 
disadvantages also exist. Limited by the 
transistor breakdown voltage, the rated supply 
voltage is low in ultra-deep-submicrom 
CMOS technologies. As a result, the threshold 
voltage of the transistor is also low, which is 
advantageous to implement low-voltage 
applications. With ultra-deep-submicron 
technologies, the threshold is reduced as the 
supply voltage is decreased. This makes the 
driving of the switches possible without 
bootstrapping circuit. Low- thV  devices relax 
designs of low-voltage operation. In the 
low- thV  process, however, nonlinear 
subthreshold leakage current can be a critical 
issue on analog circuit. The leakage current 
can be expressed as follows [6], [7]:

where m and Tv  denote the body effect 
coefficient and thermal voltages, respectively. 
There are two ways of reducing the leakage 
current by using (3) without significantly 
increasing the length of a transistor, which 
will unacceptably increase the on-resistance 
of the switch. The first method of reducing 
the leakage current is to equalize the drain and 
source voltages in (3) [8]. However, the 
leakage current might still exist in this method. 
The second method involves applying a 
reverse voltage across the gate and the source

These capacitors are used to provide 
continuous-time feedback during the 
nonoverlapping times when all the switches 
are open and hence will eliminate the 
generation of output glitches. 
 
(4.1) LOW-VOLTAGE BUILDING BLOCKS 
In this section, the low-voltage circuit 
building blocks used in the 
subthreshold-leakage suppressed fully 
differential CMOS switched-capacitor 
amplifiers are discussed. 
 
(4.1.1) Op Amp 
Fig. 8 shows the op amp that is used. It is 
based on a fully differential folded-cascode 
p-type two-stage Miller-compensated 
configuration. The second stage is a 
common-source amplifier with active load 
which also allows a large output swing. In 
order to avoid the common-mode feedback 
(CMFB) circuit for the first stage, transistors 
M51, M52, M61, and M62 similar to that 
presented in [11] are used. For the second 
stage, a passive switched-capacitor CMFB 
circuit with symmetric loading of the 
differential-mode loop, shown in Fig. 9 is 
used [12]. The CMFB circuit senses the 
output common-mode voltage and provides 
the control voltage to balance the op amp’s 
positive and negative outputs. The CMOS 
transmission gates are used to connect and 
disconnect the common-mode sensing 
capacitor. For low- thV  process, no 
conductance gap appears around the middle of 
the supply range. The subthreshold leakage 
error associated with the CMOS transmission 
gates can be reduced effectively by choosing 
1cmfbC   larger than  2cmfbC  with the 
principles similar to [13]. The results of 
simulations predicting the performance of the 
op amp with a load of 6-pF are summarized in 
Table I. The unity-gain bandwidth of the op 
amp is simulated to be 5-MHz with a phase 
margin of 120o. 
 
(4.1.2) Capacitor 
The capacitors used in the 
switched-capacitor amplifier are MIM 
(metal-insulator-metal) capacitors. 
 
(5)結果與討論 
(5.1)結果 
 Based on the principle presented earlier, 
we have designed a 0.6-V 
subthreshold-leakage suppressed fully 
differential CMOS switched-capacitor 
amplifier. This switched-capacitor amplifier 
was operated with  0.3-V. The capacitor 
sizes used were 1C (
'
1C ) =1.25-pF, 2C (
'
2C ) 
=0.25-pF, and 3C (
'
3C ) =0.75-pF, for a 
nominal gain of -5. The circuit of Fig. 7 was 
fabricated using a TSMC 0.18-μm CMOS 
technology. The threshold voltages are 
0.269-V and –0.127-V for nMOS transistors 
and pMOS transistors, respectively.  
For Fig. 7, the measured input/output 
waveforms for a 0.2-V peak-to-peak 
sinusoidal differential input signal are shown 
in Fig. 10. To obtain a satisfactory settling 
behavior under 5-MHz unity-gain bandwidth 
of the op amp, the maximum clock frequency 
is 1-MHz. The input signal was at 10-kHz 
where as the clock signal was at 1-MHz. It 
can be seen that the gain is very close to the 
nominal value of -5. Shown in Fig. 11 are the 
measured input/output waveforms of the 
conventional switched-capacitor amplifier 
corresponding to Fig. 7, where AT-switch’s 
are replaced with CMOS transmission gates 
and stack switches are replaced with nMOS 
transistors. The output waveform is distorted 
and its gain is also far from the nominal value 
of -5. This is due to the leakage current that 
introduces nonlinear errors 
Fig.12 and Fig. 13 show the resulting 
output spectrum. As shown in Fig. 12 and Fig. 
13, the even-order harmonics have been 
largely attenuated by the fully differential 
topology and the largest harmonic component 
was 42 -dB and 31 -dB below the 
fundamental of the input signal, respectively. 
The signal-to-THD (total harmonic distortion) 
ratio was 40 -dB and 29 -dB, respectively. 
The circuit of Fig.7 dissipates 145.39-μW 
with a 0.6-V power supply. The experimental 
results of the proposed switched-capacitor 
amplifier are summarized in Table II in 
comparison to other existing CMOS 
switched-capacitor amplifiers. In the proposed 
subthreshold-leakage suppressed 
switched-capacitor amplifier, the operating 
supply voltage is lower than those of the 
realizations in [4] and [5], and its
