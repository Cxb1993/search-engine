 two case studies are designed for controlling 
the nonpoint source pollution from mine 
drainage and agricultural land. In the two 
cases, the compound BMPs with different 
treatment units are set for specific functions. 
In the case of the clay mine site, a wet 
detention pond, a basin with gabions of 
small rocks and a structural wetland are 
placed to remove the high suspended solids 
and acidity in mine drainage. In addition to a 
wet detention pond, two constructed 
wetlands and a planted infiltrative bed are 
disposed for the agriculture case study in the 
purpose of nutriment removal. Eventually, 
the Effluent Probability Method (EPM) 
which reveals more information than classic 
evaluation methods is applied to evaluate 
the performance of the wet detention ponds. 
The total treatment system of the mine case 
facilitates the mean pollution removal rate 
for suspended solid (SS) is 75.9% and 
71.5% for dissolved iron. The mean removal 
rate of 55.6% for total phosphorus (TP) and 
34.3% for total nitrogen (TN) are 
contributed from BMPs in agriculture case 
study. In addition to the removal rates of 
different pollutants, EPM displayed that 
higher treatment efficiency happened in 
higher inflow concentration of SS and TN, 
but there is no such relationship in TP 
removal.
