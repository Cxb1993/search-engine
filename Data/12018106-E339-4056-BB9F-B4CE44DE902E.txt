Experimental Section 
CdS nanostructures were synthesized in a quartz tube, heated with a three-zone furnace. The 
quartz tube was with a diameter of 2.5 cm and length of 65 cm. The three-zone furnace was with a 
length of 45 cm. For three-zone hot-wall furnaces, the set temperature is achieved at the central 
portion of the furnace, about 12 cm in length. The furnace temperature ramps down to lower 
temperatures at the furnace entrance and exit. In the present work, we collected the deposits with 
quartz or silicon plates at locations near the furnace entrance with collection temperatures of 250, 
350, and 400°C, corresponding to furnace temperatures of 350, 450, and 550°C, respectively. The 
molecular single-source precursor, Cd(S2CNProp2)2, had been proven capable of growing CdS 
nanowires with the VLS mechanism at low temperatures in our previous study. The precursor was 
heated to a temperature of 160℃ to generate needed precursor vapours. The precursor vapours were 
introduced into the furnace by carrier gas N2. The depositions were run at an amount of 0.1 gram of 
precursor for 6 hr. The precursor was used up at the end of the deposition. All reactions were run at 
a carrier gas flow rate of 50 sccm and a system pressure of 30 torr. 
 
Results and Discussion 
At the furnace temperature of 450°C, bundles of quasi-aligned CdS nanowires were found to 
grow on top of a 1-µm thick buffer layer laid on the substrate surface (Fig. 1a). The nanowires were 
with diameter of 30 nm and length of about 700 nm. On decreasing the furnace temperature to 
350°C, while keeping all other deposition conditions fixed, nanoparticle films of CdS with particle 
diameter of 50 nm were found to grow uniformly over the substrate (Fig. 1b). If increasing the 
furnace temperature to 550°C, bundles of CdS nanowires were again obtained but with much 
improved wire alignment (Fig. 1c). The well-aligned nanowires were with a diameter of 30 nm and 
length of several micrometers. The furnace temperature certainly played an important role in 
determining the deposit morphology, which in turn led to dramatic difference in field emission 
performance as discussed later.

quasi-aligned nanowires, (b) nanoparticle film, (c) bundles of well-aligned nanowires. 
 
The morphology and crystallographic structures of the CdS nanostructures were further 
characterized with TEM and HRTEM. Fig. 2(a) shows a typical TEM image of the free-standing 
bundles of CdS nanowires. The dot pattern of the inset SAED image suggests single crystallinity for 
the bundle of CdS nanowires and was indexed to the hexagonal crystalline structure. The 
lattice-resolved HRTEM images taken at the marked regions of the bundle of quasi-aligned 
nanowires are shown in Figures 2(b), (c), and (d) to further reveal their detailed crystallographic 
structures. The images show interlayer spacings of 0.67 and 0.36 nm, in good agreement with the d 
spacings of the (0001) and (10-10) lattice planes of the hexagonal CdS crystal. The axis of the CdS

A possible growth mechanism for these CdS nanostructures was proposed as follows. Since no 
catalysts were used and no guiding heads were found at the tips of the as-grown CdS nanowires, the 
common 1-D growth mechanism of VLS can be ruled out. Initially, the CdS deposits grew in the 
3-D island mode because of the large difference in surface free energy between CdS and the quartz 
substrate.7 With long enough deposition time, the islands grew larger and overlapped to form 
particle films as observed for the case of 350 oC (Fig. 1b). When the furnace temperature was raised 
higher, the growth rate was increased and the particle film grew thicker, during which the 
preferential growth habit of CdS in [0001] became more and more dominant as evidenced from Fig. 
2. Towards the end of the deposition, the consumption of precursor led to decrease in precursor 
vapour pressure although the total pressure was maintained constant. The decrease in precursor 
vapour pressure favours the growth mode of high surface-to-volume ratio,8 enabling a shift from 
film to wire growth. From another viewpoint, the amount of precursor vapour became insufficient 
to support film growth, thus favouring the island growth mode which together with the preferential 
growth habit of CdS resulted in nanowire formation. For typical hexagonal crystals, such as ZnS, 
ZnO, and CdS, growth of the nanocrystals with a preferential direction along the c-axis, the 
direction of the fastest growth rate, without the presence of guiding catalysts or templates was 
commonly observed in the literature.9 As has been pointed out in Ref. 9(d), the growth of CdS may 
proceed as a stacking process of the {CdS4} tetrahedrals by sharing their common corners. Since at 
the interface of CdS each tetrahedral has a corner in the [0001] direction, this favors the growth of 
CdS along the [0001] axis (the c-axis).9(d) In the present work, with suitable control of the 
deposition conditions, growth of 1-D CdS nanostructures along its c-axis direction was also 
achieved. Interestingly, even for the nanoparticle film, a more common deposit form of CdS,10 the 
c-axis was still the preferred growth direction as can be inferred from the XRD pattern shown in Fig.

Conclusion 
By carefully controlling the deposition conditions, we successfully synthesized various CdS 
nanostructures in a non-catalytic and template-free MOCVD process. The as-grown nanoparticle 
films (350℃), bundles of quasi-aligned (450℃), and well-aligned nanowires (550℃) were 
fabricated at increasing furnace temperatures. The furnace temperature certainly played an 
important role in determining the deposit morphology, which in turn led to dramatic difference in 
field emission performance. The as-grown bundles of well-aligned CdS nanowires can achieve high 
emission current densities. This high current density would enable bundles of well-aligned CdS 
nanowires to produce sufficient brightness for the application of flat panel displays and to serve as 
high brightness electron sources.6

corresponding plain and binary compounds,5 and by adjusting the stoichiometry of the constituent 
components, their properties can be effectively tuned.6 For examples, Cd1-xZnxS nanowires,1a 
Cd1-xZnxSe nanowires,3c and CdSxSe1-x nanobelts3a were shown to possess color-tunable emissions 
by adjusting the compositional ratios of Cd to Zn and S to Se of the nanostructures, respectively. 
Cd1-xZnx S nanoribbons, fabricated with a vapor transport process, have been demonstrated their 
wavelength-controlled lasing properties.3b It has also been shown that adjustment of composition in 
Cd1-xZnxS films led to optimization for the photoelectrochemical properties of the films.7 
 
For practical applications in many fields, well-aligned 1-D nanostructures such as nanowire8a and 
nanotube8b arrays are often desirable to acquire full utilization of the benefit associated with the 
one-dimensional structure and to enable direct integration of the nanostructure to the targeted 
devices. For example, for field emission applications, good alignment of the 1-D nanostructure and 
good contact between the nanostructure and the substrate are essential to the success of the device. 
In applications involving mass transfer of participating chemical species and functioning charge 
carriers, for example, sensors and solar cell and fuel cell electrodes, alignment of the 1-D 
nanostructure provides straight transfer paths for the diffusing reactant and product molecules and 
direct short cuts for transport of charge carriers. Consequently, well-aligned arrays of 1-D 
nanostructures of relevant functional materials are of the first priority in the relevant synthetic and 
experimental designs. Wang and Song successfully prepared aligned ZnO nanowire arrays on 
c-plane sapphire substrates via a vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) process and demonstrated their 
functionality as a piezoelectric nanogenerator to convert mechanical energy into electric energy.9a 
Law et al. also synthesized ZnO nanowire arrays but on a ZnO-seeded F:SnO2 conductive glass 
with an aqueous solution process. The ZnO nanowire arrays were used as the anode of a 
dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) to convert optical energy to electric energy.9b  In addition, our 
previous work showed that well-aligned CdS nanowire arrays can be fabricated through a 
non-catalytic and template-free MOCVD process.10 The as-grown CdS nanowire arrays exhibited 
excellent field emission properties, with which CdS nanowire arrays may be considered a promising 
candidate materials for high current field emitters and high brightness electron sources.  
 
 There have been many synthetic routes developed for fabrication of 1-D nanostructure arrays. 
These many processes may be roughly divided into two general categories: liquid and gas phase 
processes. For liquid phase processes, such as template assisted electrochemical deposition, it is not 
easy to obtain good quality single crystalline products, which are critical for applications 
demanding fast charge carrier transport within the 1-D nanostructure, particularly for 
semi-conducting materials. It is also troublesome to remove the template and/or to clean the 
products. On the other hand, creation of 1-D nanostructure arrays in gas phase processes often 
involves catalyst seeds for induction anisotropic growth of the desired materials. The catalyst seeds 
may interfere with the potential application of the products and the removal of which may damage 
or contaminate the nanostructure. In view of the above, there have been research efforts devoted to 
develop non-catalytic, template-free gas phase processes for production of 1-D nanostructure 
arrays.3c,8a,10,11 One-dimensional nanostructure arrays of single component and core-shell 
morphology have been successfully fabricated with such attempts. The present work takes the 
approach one step further to produce 1-D nanowire arrays of alloyed semiconductors, Cd1-xZnxS. 
With the ability to adjust the composition of the alloy nanowire arrays, we can not only investigate 
the emission tunability but also study the effect of composition on the field emission properties of 
the products. 
 
 It is well known that field emission properties of semiconductor materials depend on several 
key factors including shape, size, alignment, tip sharpness, composition, spatial distribution, 
crystallinity, aspect ratio, etc. Zhao et al. prepared and compared the field emission performance of 
three ZnO arrays of different shape. Among them, the ZnO nanoneedle arrays exhibited much better 
field emission performance than arrays of nanocavities and nanobottles.12 This difference can be

crystallographic structures of the nanowires were investigated with an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, 
MAC Sience MXP18), a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010, operated at 200 
kV), and a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-400EX, operated at 400 kV). The elemental 
analyses of individual nanowires were conducted with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), an 
accessory of the TEM (JEM-2010). For photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, a Hitachi F-4500 
spectrometer equipped with a xenon lamp (150W) and a 700V photomultiplier tube as detector was 
used. The excitation wavelength was set at 350 nm. The field emission measurement of the 
nanowire arrays were conducted in a vacuum chamber maintained at a pressure of 10-6 torr. A 
copper electrode probe was taken as the anode with the area of 7.1 × 10-3 cm2. The anode was 
placed at a distance of 200-400 µm from the tips of the nanowires during the measurement. 
 
Results and Discussion 
 
  Well-aligned plain CdS and ternary Cd1-xZnxS nanowire arrays were fabricated at a set furnace 
temperature of 450oC and collected at locations of 300oC and 400oC in the furnace. The 
morphology of the nanowire array samples was first investigated with SEM. From Figures 1(a)-1(c), 
well-aligned CdS and Cd1-xZnxS nanowire arrays, accompanied by a buffer layer of about 1-µm 
thick laid on the silicon substrate surface, were observed. The nanowires were 30 nm in diameter 
(as determined from the TEM images shown in latter part of the article) and 500-900 nm in length. 
The corresponding XRD patterns of the as-grown CdS deposits collected at 300oC and Cd1-xZnxS 
deposits collected at 300 and 400oC and annealed at 500oC for 48 hr were shown in Figure 1(d). 
Also included in Figure 1(d) are the XRD patterns of the reference hexagonal CdS crystals (JCPDS 
file no. of 06-0314), ternary Cd0.72Zn0.28S crystals (JCPDS file no. of 40-0836), and Cd0.22Zn0.78S 
crystals (JCPDS file no. of 35-1469) for comparison purpose. For the CdS deposits, a predominant 
diffraction peak at 2θ of around 26.4o corresponding to the (0002) planes of the hexagonal 
crystalline structure of the reference CdS (at 2θ=26.45o) was observed, indicating that the as-grown 
CdS deposits are hexagonal in crystalline structure and possess a structural orientation along its 
c-axis. For the annealed Cd1-xZnxS deposits collected at 300oC, the predominant peak at 2θ of 26.9o 
lies between the (0002) peaks of the reference CdS (at 2θ=26.45o) and ternary Cd0.72Zn0.28S crystals 
(at 2θ=27.10o), indicating that the x value of the Cd1-xZnxS nanowire arrays collected at 300oC is 
less than 0.28 and greater than 0. As for the annealed Cd1-xZnxS deposits collected at 400oC, the 
predominant peak at 2θ of 27.4o lies between the (0002) peaks of the reference ternary Cd0.72Zn0.28S 
(at 2θ=27.10o) and ternary Cd0.22Zn0.78S (at 2θ=27.85o), indicating that the x value of the Cd1-xZnxS 
nanowire arrays collected at 400oC is greater than 0.28 but less than 0.78. The presence of the 
predominant diffraction peak of the (0002) plane reflects the fact that the nanowires were well 
aligned vertical to the substrate and grew along the preferential growth direction of [0002]. The 
alignment however was not perfect so that minor diffractions still appear from other planes. Also 
note that the predominant diffraction peak shifts to larger 2θ with increasing Zn incorporation 
(greater x). This is expected since Zn is smaller than Cd in atomic radius and its replacement of Cd 
tends to reduce the corresponding lattice constant, thus resulting in larger 2θ. Note further that 
higher collection temperatures provide more thermal energy necessary to overcome the activation 
energy associated with the replacement process of Cd with Zn and thus lead to more Zn 
incorporation for the alloy nanowire arrays collected at 400oC than at 300oC.  
 12
about 79:21 and 56:44 for the alloy nanowires collected at 300 and 400 oC, respectively. Dot 
patterns were observed in the corresponding SAED images for the two alloy samples, suggesting 
that these ternary nanowires were also single crystalline. The SAED patterns can be indexed to the 
reflections of the hexagonal crystalline structure, consistent with the conclusion drawn from the 
corresponding XRD results. The lattice-resolved image taken on a single Cd1-xZnxS nanowire 
collected at 300 oC was shown in Fig. 2(d). The interlayer spacing of about 0.66 nm corresponds 
well to the d-spacing of the (0001) planes of the ternary Cd1-xZnxS hexagonal crystal as determined 
from the XRD analysis (d(0002)=0.331 nm). As to the Cd1-xZnxS sample collected at 400 oC, a 0.64 
nm interlayer spacing was observed, in good agreement with the d-spacing of the (0001) planes of 
the hexagonal Cd1-xZnxS, as determined from the XRD analysis (d(0002)=0.325 nm). Note that the 
interlayer spacing of the (0001) planes decreases with increasing Zn incorporation in the nanowire. 
This is expected from the consideration of the relative atomic size of Cd and Zn, as discussed in the 
XRD section. The axes of both Cd1-xZnxS nanowire samples were parallel to the [0001] direction, 
indicating that these Cd1-xZnxS nanowires grew along the [0001] direction. This observation is in 
good agreement with the XRD analyses of the Cd1-xZnxS nanowire arrays with the (0002) 
diffraction peak being dominant over the other diffraction peaks (Fig. 1(d)). 
 
Fig. 2 TEM images taken on a single (a) CdS nanowire, (c) Cd1-xZnxS nanowire collected at 300 oC 
and (e) Cd1-xZnxS nanowire collected at 400 oC. Their corresponding HRTEM images were shown 
in (b), (d) and (f), respectively. 
 
The PL spectra for the plain CdS and Cd1-xZnxS nanowire arrays are compared in Figure 3. For 
the CdS nanowires, a typical near band edge emission with the peak centering around 535 nm was 
observed (Eg=2.5 eV,15a-b corresponging to an absorption edge of 496 nm). This emission originated 
from the radiative band-to-band recombination process of excitons. As to the ternary Cd1-xZnxS 
nanowires collected at 300 and 400oC, emission bands at around 498 and 473 nm were observed, 
respectively. To identify the essence of these emission bands from the ternary Cd1-xZnxS nanowires, 
we presented the following argument. The bulk bandgap energy for ternary Cd1-xZnxS alloys can be 
described with the following equation:6a 
Eg(x) = 2.5 + 0.59x + 0.61x2 [eV]                                                 (1) 
The atomic ratios of Zn/(Zn+Cd) for the Cd1-xZnxS nanowires collected at 300 and 400oC were 
estimated to be 0.21 and 0.44, respectively, from the corresponding TEM-EDS analyses. By 
 14
generally accepted that β is related to the geometry, structure, and density of the nanostructures 
examined.19 In this work, the three samples all possessed similar structural characteristics, 
morphology, length and diameter. Hence, the differences in β among them mainly came from the 
compositional diversity in the nanowires. In other words, the incorporation of Zn into CdS led to a 
depression in β value. The incorporation of Zn into CdS caused an increase in the energy gap, 
resulting in a decrease in free carrier concentration and an increase in resistivity.20 The increased 
resistivity would hinder the free electrons from moving through the nanowires and thus 
significantly raise the voltage drop along the nanowires when electrons with the same current 
density were transported.21 As a result, a depression in field emission efficiency was observed for 
the Cd1-xZnxS nanowire arrays as compared to the plain CdS nanowires. Moreover, the further 
incorporated amount of Zn led to even worse field emission ability for the Cd1-xZnxS nanowire 
arrays collected at 400oC.

Figure 6(d) shows how composition, quantified as x, affects the value of β0 and d2. For the 
present case, the incorporation of Zn to CdS (increasing x) suppresses the field emission of the 
nanowires (decreasing β0). Interestingly, the trends for β0 and d2 are opposite to each other. When 
the field emission ability of the emitter improves (increasing β0), the emitter needs only thinner 
 18
zones before annealing. The morphology of the nanowire array lain on top of a buffer layer 
remained unchanged after the annealing treatment. Note that annealing is commonly utilized in 
materials syntheses to achieve uniformity in both composition and crystallinity desired for final 
product applications.25
