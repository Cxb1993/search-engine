Introduction
In the past two decades, wireless communication has grown with unprecedented speed
from early radio paging, cordless telephone and cellular telephony to today’s personal com-
munication and computing devices. These commercial wireless applications have had a great
impact on today’s business world and people’s daily lives. The growth and demand for wire-
less services will play a significant role in the evolution of Internet service from wireline
systems to wireless systems.
With the increasing demand of communication service for subscribers, e.g., the need of
multi-media message, the frequency spectrum has become more and more a precious resource.
Hence, the major challenge for future wireless communications will be to effectively enhance
the capability of radio access, under a limited bandwidth requirement, so as to achieve high
transmission rate and high link quality (LQ). Also, the power requirements are that devices
should use as little power as possible to conserve battery life and keep the products small.
Wireless system designers are thus faced with a two-part challenge: improve performance
and increase data rates while incurring little or no increase in bandwidth or power. In
particular, the wireless channel is characterized by its random and unpredictable nature,
and in general the channel error rates are poorer over a wireless channel than over a wired
channel. Therefore, the major problem in wireless channel is the signal distortion due to
1
of diversity can be applied in the frequency, temporal and spatial domains [1]-[3].
• Frequency Diversity: Replicas of the information bearing signal are transmitted in
different frequency bands, where the separation between the frequency bands is greater
than the coherent bandwidth of the channel. For example, the equalization, RAKE and
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) are the common used techniques
for achieving the frequency diversity.
• Temporal Diversity: In this case, replicas of the information bearing signal are trans-
mitted in different time slots, where the separation between the time slots is greater
than the coherent time of the channel. A more well-known technique for temporal
diversity is the channel coding with interleaving.
• Spatial Diversity: Spatial diversity (SD) is also called antenna diversity. It has been
observed that antennas with a spacing of more than a number of wavelengths (coherent
distance) lead to spatially uncorrelated channels. The transmission of replicas of the
information bering signal over these uncorrelated spatial channels leads to SD. Polar-
ization diversity and angle diversity are two special examples of SD. On the other hand,
selection combining, switch combining, equal gain combining and maximum ratio com-
bining (MRC) are the examples of efficient combining schemes for SD. Depending on
whether multiple antennas are used for transmission or reception, SD can be classified
into two categories: receive diversity and transmit diversity.
Note that not all kinds of diversity are always feasible. For example, a slowly fading
channel (with a long coherent time) cannot support the temporal diversity with practical in-
terleaving depths. Similarly, frequency diversity is not feasible when the coherent bandwidth
of the channel is comparable to the bandwidth of the signal employed. However, irrespective
of the channel characteristics, SD can always be exploited as long as there is sufficient spac-
ing between the antennas. It becomes very important to utilize SD at both the transmitter
and the receiver especially when other forms of diversity are not feasible due to the nature
3
multaneously achieved. They are summarized as follows and illustrated in Figure 1.2. An
excellent overview of the leverage of ST processing (smart antenna) can be found in [5], [6].
• Antenna Array Gain: Multiple antennas at the receiver or transmitter or both can
coherently combine the signal energy to improve the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
at the receiver. The average increase in signal power at the receiver is proportional
to the number of antennas. In channel with multiple antennas at the transmitter
(MISO or MIMO case), array gain exploitation requires channel information at the
transmitter. With the array gain obtained at the receiver, the signal range/coverage
can be enlarged (or the transmit power can be reduced) and the LQ can be increased.
For example, beamforming is an efficient technique to realize the antenna array gain
[5], [6].
• Interference Reduction Gain: When multiple antennas are used, the differentiation
between the spatial signatures of the desired signal and interfering signals can be
exploited by forming a null in the direction of interference to reduce its strength.
Interference reduction requires channel knowledge of the desired signal. However, exact
knowledge of the interferer’s channel may not be necessary. Interference reduction can
improve the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR). This improvement will directly enhance
the LQ and allow the introduction of reuse factors to increase network capacity. A
well-known example for achieving the interference reduction gain is the beamforming
or smart antenna technique [5], [6].
• Spatial Diversity Gain: When the antenna spacing is large enough (larger than
coherent distance), the receiver or transmitter will see independently faded versions
of the same signal. The use of high-order modulation and low BER targets make
the system very sensitive to fading. Using multiple antennas to combine the indepen-
dently faded versions of signal causes that the resultant signal exhibits considerably
reduced amplitude fluctuation in comparison with the signal at any single antenna.

very substantial in specular scenarios, but negligible in highly scattering environments. On
the other hand, the advantages of SM is significant in rich scattering case, but vanishes in
highly specular case [12]-[14].
1.2 Overview of MIMO Techniques
Multiple antennas can be used in wireless systems to improve the communication perfor-
mance. Beamforming/Equalization [2], [14]-[16], SD [2], [7], [8], and SM [11], [17], are three
very popular and different signal processing techniques in multiple-antenna systems. By
coherently combining the signals at different antennas, beamforming can efficiently cancel
the interference and provide an improved coverage [18]. SD attempts to spread informa-
tion across antennas to enable robust transmission in the presence of fading [19]. SM, on
the other hand, divides data into multiple substreams and transmit each substream on a
different antenna leading to a linear increase in data rate [11]. The goals of the aforemen-
tioned techniques may be mutually conflicting, and a balance is needed to optimize system
performance [20].
1.2.1 Beamforming/Equalization Techniques
Beamforming Techniques
Spatial filtering or beamforming [15], [21]-[24] can be applied to benefit from the angu-
lar spread and commonly different spatial signatures of the desired and interfering signals.
Beamforming is achieved by adjusting the complex coefficient weights and combining (sum-
ming) the signals induced at different spatially correlated antennas to form a single output
of an array as illustrated in Figure 1.3. For the given set of complex antenna weights, the
direction in which the array has the maximum gain is typically called the beam pointing
direction. The main advantage of applying beamforming in reception comes form CCI re-
duction (filtering the desired signal from interfering signals), ISI suppression (nulling the
7
Equalization Techniques
Adaptive beamforming and AOA estimation are commonly regarded as conventional array
or space only (SO) (see Figure 1.3) processing techniques. Temporal or time only (TO)
filtering/processing techniques as shown in Figure 1.4 employ adaptive equalizers to offer
time domain ISI suppression (and possible CCI reduction) by complex coefficient weighting
and combining of the temporally sampled signals [1], [2], [28]. ST beamforming (also called
the ST filtering/processing technique) is loosely defined as any combination of SO and TO
filtering/processing. Figure 1.5 depicts the joint ST processing. It allows the advantages
to be simultaneously exploited in both dimensions improving the different aspects in the
performance of a wireless communication system. For a comprehensive overview of the
ST processing area see [15], [28]. A popular optimality criterion in ST processing is the
maximum likelihood (ML) criterion based on the Viterbi algorithm. It is usually referred to
as the ML sequence estimation (MLSE) [1]. Other frequently used criteria are the MMSE
and zero-forcing (ZF) [1], [28]. In theory, ST MLSE outperforms ST MMSE in the presence
of significant ISI. However, for strong CCI scenarios, ST MMSE is superior to ST MLSE.
An efficient approach to combating the CCI and ISI problems is to combine the strengths of
MMSE and MLSE in a two-stage hybrid structure [29].
Transmit Beamforming/Equalization Techniques
One possible approach for antenna array transmit processing is transmit beamforming
[30], [31], which provides antenna array gain and interference reduction gain at the subscriber
unit. In this scheme, the transmitter typically operates in a “closed-loop” manner, which
means that it uses the channel information fed back by the receiver through the uplink link
in order to shape the beams so that the subscriber unit can receive the desired signal without
interference in the downlink. This scheme can significantly reduce the computational load at
the subscriber unit. However, the success of transmit beamforming depends on the quality of
the channel estimates, feedback channel, mapping between the two links, and dynamics of the
9
as an STC [37]. After that, in 1996, the delay TD combined the signal design with linear
modulation was proposed by Guey et al [38]. However, due to the degrading orthogonality
and increasing interference level seen at the mobile receiver, the delay TD has a limited link
performance gain over the non-transmit diversity [39].
Another approach in [40] recommended that each user can be assigned a different or-
thogonal code for each transmit antenna. This scheme can provide arbitrary-fold diversity
and have very simple demodulation scheme, but the diversity gain and simplicity of this
scheme come with the penalty of requiring more than one spreading codes per user. One
open-loop approach that offers some diversity gains without requiring extra resource is the
orthogonal transmit diversity (OTD) scheme [41], which was an early inclusion as an option
in the IS-2000 standard. According to this technique, each user’s data stream is extended
by one spreading code and transmitted through each transmit antenna in a scanning way.
However, OTD provides unbalanced diversity to each of the user’s data substreams, and
usually OTD cannot provide full SD gain. Without interleaving or channel coding, OTD
does not improve the transmission performance.
Another very important approach for TD is STC technique as shown in Figure 1.6.
STC techniques are first put forward under the assumption of narrow band wireless fading
environment. But these techniques can be easily applied to wideband communications by
combining with other wideband communication techniques such as code division multiple
access (CDMA) [42], [43] or OFDM [44], [45]. Generally, STC can be classified into two
broad categories, the ST trellis coding (STTC) and ST block coding (STBC).
• STBC Scheme: The first STBC was proposed by Alamouti for two transmit anten-
nas, the so called Alamouti’s code [46], in 1998. Then it was further developed and
put into a theoretical framework by Tarokh, Jafarkhani and Calderbank [47]. STBC
operates on a block of input symbols and produces a matrix output whose columns
represent times and rows represent antennas. Unlike traditional single antenna block
codes for the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, STBC may not provide
11
1.2.3 Spatial Multiplexing Techniques
In 1987, Winters first hinted that the capacity can be increased significantly by using
multiple antennas at the transmitter and/or receiver [52]. After some years, a ground break-
ing result of the SM concepts was exploited by Paulraj and Kailath in 1994 for broadcast
digital television systems [53]. Figure 1.7 illustrates the SM concepts in a MIMO system. In
1995, recent advances in information theory opened by Telatar [9], Foschini and Gans [10]
revealed an important fact that the rich scattering multipath wireless channel can lift enor-
mous SE (capacity) if the multipath propagation is properly exploited using multiple anten-
nas at the transmitter and receiver. The communication system architecture of the LSTCs,
which are first developed by Foschini in 1996 [54], provides an experimental demonstration.
The LSTCs can be categorized into two large types, the vertical-BLAST (V-BLAST) and
diagonal-BLAST (D-BLAST).
• V-BLAST Scheme: In V-BLAST systems, independently encoded data streams are
transmitted from each transmit antenna simultaneously, and detected at the receiver by
nulling and ordered successive interference cancellation (OSIC) schemes [17], [54]-[56],
or sphere decoding scheme [57].
• D-BLAST Scheme: In D-BLASTs, each data stream switches transmit antenna after
each symbol duration time slot and the completing of each data stream transmission
is contributed by all transmit antennas. With the channel coding scheme, a more
momentous advantage possessed by the D-BLAST is that it can effectively provide
additional time diversity [54], [58]. Like V-BLASTs, D-BLASTs also use the nulling
and OSIC schemes for data detection at the receiver. However, due to the encoding
structure, the detection framework of D-BLAST is more complex than that of V-
BLAST [54], [58].
With BLAST systems, very high data transmission rate can be achieved. However,
BLAST cannot be used when the number of receive antennas is smaller than the number
13
instantaneous probability of error. Other various transmission scheme combined with the O-
STBC and V-BLAST techniques have also been proposed for simultaneously achieving the
two demands [7], [64], [65]. On the other hand, the observation on such tradeoffs motivates
the design of switched diversity and multiplexing systems which use spatial adaptation to
improve link performance based on the euclidean distance between the received signal and
transmitted data streams [66], [67].
1.3 Background and Literature Review
Future wireless applications create the insatiability in the demand for high data rate and
high LQ wireless access [3]-[8], [14], [68], [69]. Spectrum has thus become a scarce and very
expensive resource so that a good spectrum management is very important for achieving
high SE. Intuitively, the simplest technique to tackle this is to increase the transmit power.
However, since system capacity is interference limited in most of the wireless communication
systems, SE cannot be directly increased by this way [70]. On the other hand, the popular
time and frequency domain processing techniques may also sacrifice the spectrum resource
and thus are limited for use. Only the space domain processing technique is not [14], [15].
The adoption of multiple antennas at the transmitter and receiver, i.e., MIMO technique
[10], [17], [47], [49], [54], [55] promises a significant increase in data rate and LQ without
bandwidth expansion and is thus capable of meeting the formidable service requirements in
the next-generation wireless communications.
The core scheme of MIMO systems is the STC [3]-[8], [14], [68], [69]. The two main
functions of STC are the SM and TD. High SE can be achieved through SM by simultane-
ously transmitting independent data streams from different antennas, e.g., LSTCs or a.k.a.,
BLAST techniques [54]-[56]. High LQ, on the other hand, is guaranteed if redundant signals
are made and sent from different antennas through independent channels to the receiver.
STBCs [46], [47] and STTCs [49] are the two well-know TD techniques for MIMO systems.
15
the principle components (PC) technique [72], whose performance degrades as the dimension
of the adaptive weights is lower than that of the signal-plus-interference subspace [74]. An
alternative to the PC technique is the cross spectral (CS) technique [73]. Unfortunately,
these two techniques require either the eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) or matrix inversion,
which is computationally expensive. A relatively simple RR technique which requires no
EVD or matrix inversion is the iterative based MVDR (IMVDR) technique [76]. It can
iteratively solve for the optimal MVDR weight vector and corresponding bases (auxiliary
vectors) for the best representation of the solution, simultaneously. The main disadvantage
of the iterative MVDR technique, however, is the need of a large number of iterations for
convergence. RR processing is very suitable for the equalization problem considered herein.
This is seen by the observation that the signal-plus-ISI channel matrix has a special band
Toeplitz structure in which the leading and trailing columns corresponding to “distant”
pre- and post-cursor ISI, respectively, have a sparse structure with many zero entries. These
columns are “insignificant” relative to the middle ones, which suggests that using an equalizer
with an effective rank smaller than that of the signal-plus-interference subspace (i.e., rank of
the channel matrix) should be sufficient to achieve the optimal FR performance. On the other
hand, in [77], an RR (partially adaptive (PA)) MIMO MMSE DFE has been proposed based
on the generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC) technique [23] and a simple algebraic criterion
for determining the blocking matrix of the GSC. In spite of its simplicity, the DFE in [77]
requires a matrix inversion for detecting each user signal, and suffers a certain performance
degradation at high SNR due to a limited diversity order [59].
MU ST block coded systems [4], [7], [61], [70] can provide multiple fading resistant links
but the cochannel user interference then becomes a crucial factor for system performance.
In stead of resorting to the computationally-intensive joint ML decoding for signal recovery,
there are various proposals exploiting the algebraic structures of the orthogonal ST block
codes for facilitating interference mitigation, e.g., the Naguib’s parallel interference cancel-
lation (PIC) scheme [78], and the Stamoulis’s decoupled-based method [79]. Recently it is
17
to other securing mechanisms for guarding the data from channel impairments if any [85].
To build up such a high-throughput link platform, a reasonable method is to endow the
transmitter with the flexibility in choosing a flexible and robust signal transmission scheme
better suited for the system requirements and/or the channel conditions. Therefore, a more
general class combined with the two concepts of SM and TD techniques should be considered
simultaneously at the transmitter. Specifically, decoupling a large transmit antenna array
into several small groups with each group using a number of antennas from two to four
and being encoded via O-STBCs [47] yields a “grouped STBC (G-STBC)”. Such a transmit
antenna configuration can be regarded as a variety of SM signaling strategy by treating one
antenna group as a particular data stream unit. Essentially, since the multiple various coding
rates can be provided by this encoding strategy over a block of symbols at the transmitter, it
can also be referred to as a “variable-rate” STBC scheme. This coding strategy is different to
the scheme proposed independently by Kim and Tarokh [86] and [87], which mainly focuses
on the small transmit antenna array (for total two, three or four antennas).
1.4 Outline of Report
This report discusses the MIMO techniques for wireless communications. First, the main
objective of the report is a detailed investigation into the performance of low-complexity,
RR ST receiver in the MIMO based environment over the frequency-selective multipath
channels. The new receiver architectures are proved to be robust and capable of interference
suppression. Furthermore, the RR schemes are incorporated at the receiver for reduced
complexity processing, and achieving the faster convergence. Then we mainly work on the
efficient design of MIMO transmitter and receiver over the frequency-flat fading channels. In
this part, a computationally efficient group-wise OSIC detector is first proposed in an MU
ST dual-signaling wireless systems for better matching to each user’s own channel condition.
Such a low-complexity group-wise OSIC detector is then properly exploited for a more general
19
The group-wise detection property, resulting uniquely from the use of orthogonal codes, also
potentially improves the signal separation efficiency. Moreover, the low-complexity detector
implementation developed in Chapter 4 is then modified and used for signal separation.
Finally, the code structures are built up based on the group-wise OSIC detection strategy
and a code selection criterion that minimizes the BER performance under the constraints of
total transmit power and SE is then proposed. Numerical examples are used for illustrating
the performance of the proposed G-STBCs and OSIC based solution.
Finally, Chapter 5 concludes this report.

2.2 MIMO System Model
In this section, we define the MIMO system model with N transmit antennas and M
receive antennas for the time division multiple access (TDMA) systems. Several commonly
used MIMO channel models are also discussed and the received sampled signal models are
derived.
2.2.1 Continuous-Time MIMO Systems Model
For the MIMO channels, the received signal, in based form, at the mth antenna can be
expressed as
ym(t) :=
√
PT
N
N∑
n=1
hm,n(t)~ xn(t) + vm(t), m = 1, 2, . . . ,M, (2.1)
where PT is the total transmit power, hm,n(t) is the overall channel impulse response (CIR)
from the nth transmit antenna to themth receive antenna, which includes the effects of pulse
shaping g(t) and propagation channel c(t), xn(t) is the transmitted symbol from the nth
antenna, and vm(t) is the AWGN at the mth receive antenna with power σ
2
v . Concatenating
ym(t), m = 1, 2, . . . ,M , into a vector, we obtain an M × 1 received signal vector
y(t) := [y1(t), y2(t), . . . , yM(t)]
T =
√
PT

H(t)~ x(t) + v(t), (2.2)
where
H(t) :=

hM,1(t) hM,2(t) . . . hM,N(t)

∈ CM×N , (2.3)
is the MIMO channel vector and
x(t) := [x1(t), x2(t), . . . , xN(t)]
T ∈ CN (2.4)
is the transmitted symbol vector. v(t) is the noise vector whose components are assumed
temporally and spatially white with the same power σ2v . Note that the “row” and “column”
of H(t) in (2.3) represent the MISO CIR and SIMO CIR, respectively.
27
Non-Physical Channel Model
The scatter location, antenna element patterns and geometry and the scattering model
together determine the correlation between elements of H(τ), the channel between the trans-
mit and receive antennas. With suitable choices of the above, including a double scattering
model, it can be shown in [14] that the elements ofH(τ) are independent zero-mean circularly
symmetric complex Gaussian random variables.
We assume that the delay spread in the channel is negligible, i.e., τmax ≈ 0. Therefore,
the MIMO channel H(τ) in (2.8) can be rewritten as
H(τ) =
(
J∑
j=1
αjaR(θ
R
j )aT (θ
T
j )
)
g(τ) = Hg(τ), (2.9)
where
H :=
J∑
j=1
αjaR(θ
R
j )aT (θ
T
j ) ∈ CM×N . (2.10)
We drop g(τ) and under assumptions discussed above, with “rich scatters” in the propagation
environment, that is J ≈ ∞, the elements of H(τ) = H can be modeled to be circularly
symmetric complex Gaussian with zero-mean and unit-variance [14]. We then get
H = HJ=∞ := Hw, (2.11)
which is the i.i.d. (spatially white) channel.
The non-physical MIMO channel Hw can be restricted to SIMO and MISO channels by
dropping either columns or rows respectively. The respectively resulting vector channels are
hw with dimension M × 1 for SIMO and hTw with dimension 1×N for MISO.
So far we have considered only Rayleigh fading in describing the wireless channels. In
order to simulate a wireless channel with different degrees of scattering richness, we introduce
the well-known Ricean model. In such the mode, there are an LOS component between the
transmitter and receiver. The MIMO channel may be modeled approximately as the sum of
a “deterministic (or specular)” component and a “variable (or scattered)” component:
29
2.2.3 MIMO Sampled Signal Model
This section presents the MIMO sampled (discrete time) signal model in conjunction with
TDMA systems over the frequency selective and frequency flat fading channels. We directly
express the discrete time received signal model, in baseband form, from the continuous time
relation described in Section 2.2.1.
Remark: For TDMA systems, we assume that the channel bandwidth is Bc = 1 Hz
and the symbol period is T = 1 second. We also assume in the SISO and SIMO cases
that the average transmit symbol energy is Es. Since T = 1 second, Es is thus also the
transmit power PT . As a result, we shall refer to PT in conjunction with TDMA systems
interchangeably as energy or power throughout this report. For MISO or MIMO channels,
we assume that the average total transmit power per symbol period is constant and therefore
the symbol power per antenna is reduced by the number of transmit antennas N , i.e., the
average total transmit power per symbol per antenna is PT/N . On the other hand, assume
that the AWGN is modeled as independent circularly symmetric complex Gaussian random
variable with zero-mean and variance σ2v . Due to Bc = 1 Hz, the noise power σ
2
v in the band
is the same as spectral power density N0. As a result, we interchangeably refer to σ
2
v as noise
power or noise spectral density.
Consider a MIMO system with N transmit antennas andM receive antennas. In to order

The maximum information rate that can be used causing negligible probability of errors
at the channel output is called the “channel capacity”. The channel capacity for AWGN
channels was first derived by C. Shannon in 1948 [92]. With a band-limited channel, the
capacity is measured in information bits per second. It is common to represent the channel
capacity within a unit bandwidth of the channel. The channel capacity is then measured in
bits/sec/Hz (or bps/Hz).
It is desirable to design transmission schemes that exploit the channel capacity as much
as possible. Representing the input and output of a memoryless (frequency flat) channel
with the random variables X and Y respectively, the channel capacity is defined as [93]
C := max
p(x)
I(X;Y ), (2.32)
where
I(X;Y ) := H(Y )−H(Y |X), (2.33)
is the mutual information between X and Y , with H(Y ) and H(Y |X) being the differential
entropy of Y and differential conditional entropy of Y with knowledge ofX given, respectively
[93]. The entropy of a random variable can be described as a measure of the uncertainty
of the random variable. In (2.32), it states that the mutual information is maximized with
respect to all possible transmitter statistical distributions p(x).
2.3.1 Channel Unknown to The Transmitter
SISO Channel Capacity
For a SISO system, the ergodic (mean) capacity of a random channel can be expressed
as [93]
C := E
{
max
p(x):P=1
I(X;Y )
}
, (2.34)
where P := E {|x(k)|2} is the power of a symbol transmitted over the channel and E{·}
denotes the expectation over all channel realizations. The capacity defined in (2.34) is
35
transmitted symbol x(k) is an i.i.d. random variable with zero-mean and unit-variance. As
a result, the ergodic capacity for a spatially white MIMO channel can be written as [9], [10]
C = E
{
log2
[
det
(
IM +
PT
σ2vN
HHH
)]}
= E
{
log2
[
det
(
IM +
ρ
N
HHH
)]}
, (2.40)
where H is the MIMO channel matrix given in (2.26) and ρ := PT
σ2v
is the average SNR at
each receiver branch. Consider a MIMO channel with M = N and H = Hw. Using the
strong law of large numbers, we have the result
1
N
HHH
N→∞−→ IN , (2.41)
Therefore, the capacity of this channel in the absence of channel knowledge at the transmitter
approaches
C →M · log2(1 + ρ). (2.42)
Asymptotically (in N), the capacity of a spatially white MIMO channel thus becomes deter-
ministic and increases “linearly” with N for a fixed SNR. From (2.42), we can also see that
for every 3 dB increase in SNR we get N bps/Hz increase in capacity for a MIMO channel
(compared with 1 bps/Hz for a SISO channel (see (2.36)).
By using the eigenvalue decomposition, the matrix product of HHH can be decomposed
asHHH = EΛEH , where E is anM×M matrix which consists of the eigenvectors satisfying
EEH = EHE = IM and Λ = diag{λ1, λ2, . . . , λM} is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues
λi ≥ 0 on the main diagonal. Assuming that the eigenvalues λi’s are ordered so that
λi ≥ λi+1, then we have λi = 0 if r + 1 ≤ i ≤M , where
r := rank(H) ≤ min{N,M}. (2.43)
Then the capacity of a MIMO channel can hence be rewritten as
C = E
{
log2
[
det
(
IM +
ρ
N
EΛEH

= E
{

r∑
i=1
E
{

)}
. (2.44)
37
2.3.2 Channel Known to The Transmitter
In absence of channel knowledge, the individual channel modes are not accessible and
that equal transmit power is allocated to each spatial data pipe. Furthermore, if the channel
knowledge is known to the transmitter, from (2.44), the capacity of a MIMO channel is the
sum of the capacities associated with the parallel SISO channels and is given by
C =
r∑
i=1
E
{
log2
(
1 + Pi
ρ
N
λi
)}
, (2.49)
where Pi := E {|xi|2}, i = 1, 2, . . . , r, is the transmit power in the ith sub-channel and
satisfies that
r∑
i=1
Pi = N. (2.50)
Because that the transmitter can access the spatial sub-channels, it can allocate variable
power across the sub-channels to maximize the mutual information. The mutual information
maximization problem now becomes [9]
C := max
Pr
i=1 Pi=N
r∑
i=1
E
{
log2
(
1 + Pi
ρ
N
λi
)}
, (2.51)
whose solution can be obtained by using the Lagrangian methods [93]. The optimal power
allocation of the ith sub-channel, P oi , is given by [9], [93]
P oi :=
(
µ− N
ρλi
)
+
, i = 1, 2, . . . , r, (2.52)
where µ is a constant chosen to satisfy the power constraint (2.50) and (x)+ denotes
(x)+ :=
 x x ≥ 00 x < 0 . (2.53)
The optimal power allocation in (2.52) is found iteratively through the “waterfilling” algo-
rithm [9], [14], [93], and this is shown in Figure 2.2.
For a MISO channel, when the transmitter knows the channel information, all power can
be directly imposed into the single spatial mode (i.e., use the waterfilling algorithm). As a
result, from (2.47), the capacity of the MISO channel in this case can be expressed as
C = E
{
log2
(
1 + ρ‖h‖2)} . (2.54)
39
Example 2.3.2: Figure 2.4 shows the complementary cumulative distribution function
(ccdf) capacity of several antenna configurations at SNR ρ = 10 dB. Again, as observed, the
capacity of a MIMO channel is much larger than the others, and the capacity of a SIMO
channel is greater than that of MISO channel as the channel knowledge is not available
at the transmitter, which consists with the results in Figure 2.3. However, as the channel
knowledge is available at the transmitter, the capacity of a SIMO channel can equal to that
of a SIMO channel. This shows that under the same antenna configuration, the capacity
of that has the channel knowledge at the transmitter can larger than that without channel
knowledge at the transmitter. Moreover, compared with Figure 2.3 (a), we find that the
ergodic capacity is the mean information rate and may equal to the median information rate
(50 percentile). On the other hand, the 90 percentile ccdf capacity will be the 10% outage
capacity shown in Figure 2.3(b).
2.4 Space-Time Block Coding
As mentioned in Section 1.2.2, when the number of antennas is fixed, the decoding com-
plexity of STTCs increases exponentially as a function of the diversity level and transmission
rate [49]. In addressing the issue of decoding complexity, we will mainly focus on the STBC
techniques due to its very simple coding structure and linear processing for ML decoding
at the receiver. In what follows, we first give a general framework for linear STBCs over
a frequency flat fading channels. Then we introduce the orthogonal designs of the STBCs
and ML detection of such the orthogonal based STBCs (O-STBCs). Finally we discuss the
performance of the O-STBCs.
2.4.1 General Framework for Linear STBC
Consider the MIMO sampled signal model (2.27). The data stream s(k), in general
complex-valued, is divided into blocks of L consecutive symbols to obtain sl(k) := s(Lk +
41
To meet the total transmit power constraint, the ST modulation matrix must satisfy [62],
[65]
‖Al‖2F := tr
(
AlA
H
l
)
=
NK
L
, l = 1, 2, . . . , 2L, (2.60)
such that
E
{
tr
(
X(k)XH(k)
)}
= NK. (2.61)
To facilitate the detection process and further analysis, it is common to rely on an asso-
ciated equivalent “vectorized” linear model [62], [65]. Specifically, let us split each received
signal vector y(k + i), i = 0, 1, . . . , K − 1, and the transmitted symbol block s(k) into the
respective real and imaginary parts to obtain
y˜(k + i) :=
[
Re
{
yT (k + i)
}
Im
{
yT (k + i)
}]T ∈ R2M , (2.62)
and
s˜(k) :=
[
Re
{
sT (k)
}
Im
{
sT (k)
}]T ∈ R2L. (2.63)
Associate with the MIMO channel matrix H, we form the following augmented matrix
H¯ := IK ⊗ H˜ ∈ R2KM×2KN , (2.64)
where
H˜ :=
 Re{H} −Im{H}
Im{H} Re{H}
 ∈ R2M×2N , (2.65)
and the notation ⊗ stands for the Kronecker product. Also, define the matrix

MU Framework
Consider aQ-user STBC system with each user terminal comprisingN transmit antennas.
Collecting y(k) over K successive symbol periods, we have the following ST signal model
(assuming that the Q users are symbol synchronized1)
Y(k) := [y(k),y(k + 1), . . . ,y(k +K − 1)] =
Q∑
q=1
√
Pq
N
HqXq(k) +V(k), (2.72)
where Pq is the total transmit power of the qth user terminal, Hq ∈ CM×N is the channel
matrix from the qth user terminal to the receiver, which is assumed to be static during the K
signaling periods, Xq(k) is the ST codeword matrix of the qth user having the same structure
as (2.57), and V(k) ∈ CM×K is the channel noise.
• Equivalent Vectorized Signal Model
We note that in the MU scenario the signal part in the matrix signal model (2.72) is a
linear mixture of the Q codeword matrices. Toward a compatible MU detection framework, it
is common to work with an associated equivalent vectorized linear model that will “restore”
each user’s symbol block. Specifically, let sq(k) :=
[
sq,1(k), sq,2(k), . . . , sq,Lq(k)
]T
be the
transmitted symbol block of the qth user. Define s˜q(k) :=
[
Re
{
sTq (k)
}
Im
{
sTq (k)
}]T ∈ R2Lq
and y˜(k) :=
[
Re
{
yT (k)
}
Im
{
yT (k)
}]T ∈ R2M to be the split real-valued symbol block of
the qth user and the received vector. Associated with the qth user’s channel matrix Hq, we
form the following augmented matrix
H¯q := IK ⊗ H˜q ∈ R2KM×2KN , (2.73)
where
H˜q :=
 Re {Hq} −Im {Hq}
Im {Hq} Re {Hq}
 ∈ R2M×2N . (2.74)
1Symbol synchronization is necessary in TDMA based cellular implementations, e.g., IS-136 and GSM,
and 3G TDD CDMA systems such as time division synchronous CDMA (TD-SCDMA). In the literature,
this assumption is commonly made when dealing with uplink interference cancellation in MU MIMO systems

with E

2.4.2 Orthogonal STBC: Encoding and Decoding
Code Construction of O-STBC
Consider the O-STBC systems as depicted in Figure 2.5. In particular, O-STBCs are a
special example of linear codes, where the codeword X(k) is design to be a unitary matrix,
which has the following “unitary property” [47].
Theorem 2.4.1. Let X(k) be an N ×K ST codeword matrix as defined in (2.57). The ST
codewords that satisfy the unitary property
X(k)XH(k) = KIN , (2.84)
are called the O-STBC. More specifically, (2.84) holds for all complex {sl(k)} if and only if

ApA
H
q = −AqAHp , p 6= q; p, q = 1, 2, . . . , 2L (2.85)
in which {Al} is also an orthogonal design. ¥
Proof: Based on (2.57) and using (2.85) and the fact |s˜l(k)|2 = 1/2, we have
X(k)XH(k) =
2L∑

• Rate 1 codes with simple linear processing is achievable for N ≤ 8 for real constella-
tions.
• Rate 1/2 codes with simple linear processing is achievable for N ≥ 2 for complex
constellations.
• Rate 3/4 codes with simple linear processing is achievable for N = 3 and N = 4 for
complex constellations.
Finally, the ST modulation matrices of O-STBCs that satisfy the properties (2.85) will
also meet the total transmit power constraint, i.e.,

which ensures the constraint (2.61).
ML Decoding of O-STBC
To realize a simple (decoupled) ML decoding of O-STBC, we need the following lemma.
Lemma 2.4.1. Let F = HTcHc ∈ R2L×2L be the MFCM of O-STBC as defined in (2.71),
where Hc ∈ R2KM×2L is given by (2.69). If {Al} satisfy the orthogonal properties (2.85),
then we have
F = αI2L, (2.90)
where α := K
L
‖H‖2F and ‖A‖F denotes the Frobenius norm of matrix A. ¥

2.4.3 Performance Analysis of O-STBC Systems
Assume that ML decoding is used at the receiver with perfect channel knowledge based
on the received signal Y(k) (see (2.59)). The estimated codeword is
Xˆ(k) := argmin
X(k)
∥∥∥∥∥Y(k)−
√
PT
N

∥∥∥∥∥
2
F
, (2.93)
where the minimization is performed over all admissible codewords X(k). An error occurs
when the receiver mistakes a transmitted codeword for another codeword from the set of
possible codewords.
Assume that a codeword X is transmitted. If the receiver uses the ML decoding to
estimate the transmitted codeword according to (2.93), the probability that the receiver
decides in favor of another codeword Xˆ(k), given the knowledge of the channel realization
at the receiver, is (also called the pairwise error probability (PEP)) [1]

where

is the codeword difference matrix. Applying the Chernoff bound [1] we have
P
(
X(k)→ Xˆ(k)
∣∣∣H) ≤ exp(−ρ ‖HB‖2F
4N
)
. (2.96)
Assuming that H = Hw, the PEP averaged, after some manipulations, over all channel
realizations can be upper-bounded as

X(k)→ Xˆ(k)

high SNR regime for O-STBCs is thus given by [14]

. (2.99)
Clearly, from (2.99), we can see that O-STBCs extract the full diversity gain of MN .
Example 2.4.1: Figure 2.6 shows the BER performance of STBCs as a function of SNR
ρ for different number of transmit antennas over a frequency flat MISO channel. Assume
that BPSK modulation is used for Figure 2.6 (a). In this case, the SE of all STBCs are the
same and equals to 1 bps/Hz. We further examine the STBC performance with the SE being
2 bps/Hz and show it in Figure 2.6 (b). In this case, the STBC with N = 2 is the unit-rate
code with QPSK modulation2. But the STBC with N = 3 and N = 4 are the half-rate code
with 16-QAM modulation. As expected, the all BER curves of Figure 2.6 decrease as ρ and
M increase, showing the diversity advantage provided by STBC schemes. As shown in the
two figures, the STBC with N = 2 provides a better performance as SNR is small. However,
when the SNR is large, the STBC with N = 4 will outperform the others.
2.5 Vertical Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time
SM scheme exploits the rich scattering wireless channel allowing the receiver to detect
the different data streams simultaneously transmitted by the different antennas. That is,
SM technique uses multiple antennas at the transmitter and receiver in conjunction with rich
scattering environment within the same frequency band to provide a “linearly” increasing
capacity gain in the number of antennas [13], [53], [54]. Therefore, the concept of SM
techniques is different from that of STC techniques, which permit to efficiently introduce
an ST correlation among transmitted data streams to improve information protection and
increase diversity gain.
2For a fair comparison, the most used approach for evaluating the performance is to examine the BER
performance under a given SE constraint [3], [82]
53
encoder can be expressed by following N × 1 symbol vector
s(k) := [s1(k), s2(k), . . . , sN(k)]
T ∈ CN , (2.100)
and the output of ST encoder is thus given by the N × 1 vector
x(k) := [x1(k), x2(k), . . . , xN(k)]
T = [s1(k), s2(k), . . . , sN(k)]
T =
2N∑
l=1
als˜l(k), (2.101)
where the ST modulation matrix Al presented in (2.57) is simplified to an N × 1 vector al
since K = 1 in SM systems. In (2.101), we can see that x(k) = s(k), which means that the
output of ST encoder is just the input to ST encoder. Considering the MIMO systems, the
received signal model can be intuitively written as (2.27)
y(k) =
√
PT
N
Hx(k) + v(k). (2.102)
Since N data streams are transmitted simultaneously from different antennas at the same
time, the code rate of SM systems is thus given by
s(k) 7→ x(k) : R = N > 1. (2.103)
On the other hand, to meet the total transmit power constraint, al must be normalized as
‖al‖2 := 1, l = 1, 2, . . . , 2L, (2.104)
such that [62], [65]

• Nulling: Nulling out all weaker signals to estimate the strongest signal.
• Slicing: Detect the strongest signal.
• Cancellation: Cancel the effect of the detected strongest signal from the received signal.
Since the SIC algorithm can be combined with ZF receiver or MMSE receiver, it can
accordingly be classified into the ZF V-BLAST receiver and MMSE V-BLAST receiver. The
main difference between the two receiver is the ordering criterion and nulling processing.
We summarize the detection algorithms of ZF V-BLAST receiver and MMSE V-BLAST
receiver.

channels. The overall MU link performance in all cases, however, crucially depends on effec-
tive interference rejection mechanisms. To the authors’ best knowledge, there seems to be
yet no related discussions aiming for a dual-signaling system; in particular, an investigation
of how the orthogonal codes can facilitate the dual-mode signal separation. In this chapter,
this problem will be addressed based on the OSIC detection approach.
B. Design Challenge and Technical Contributions
For the dual-signaling environment, there is a unique receiver design challenge to be
addressed. Observe that, since some link users will send data via the O-STBC mode, the base
station will have to suffer a certain time latency for data collection/detection so as to exploit
the diversity benefit for those O-STBC terminals. For example, if the Alamouti’s code [46] is
used, two symbol periods are the temporal latent cost for realizing a diversity gain of order
two. The inherent time latency produces link robustness for the O-STBC users at the expense
of a reduced cell-wide data processing efficiency. This is because, during the processing time
required for diversity, the base station will receive extra independent source symbols from
other high-rate SM terminals: this can enlarge the overall data processing dimension up to
a factor equal to the latent cost. As a result, there will be an unavoidable increase in the
detector complexity; the computational overload could be significant, especially for the in
general one symbol per-layer detection strategy of the OSIC algorithm.
This chapter proposes a group-wise OSIC detection scheme that can effectively tackle
such a design challenge. Specifically, it is shown that, even though some users may send
the data via the SM mode, the usage of orthogonal codes can induce a distinctive structure
on the matched-filtered channel matrix (MFCM): it consists of orthogonal design [47] block
submatrices. This fact is then exploited for developing a group-wise OSIC detector: at each
processing step a group of symbols, transmitted either from a particular O-STBC station or
from an antenna of an SM terminal during the latent time, can jointly be detected. This
result is a generalization of the work for MU STBC systems to the more general dual-signaling
69
3.2 System Model
3.2.1 System Description and Basic Assumptions
Consider the uplink MU ST wireless system over the flat fading channels as shown in
Figure 3.1, in which N transmit antennas are placed at each of the Q user terminals. The
data stream of the qth user sq(k) (q = 1, 2, . . . , Q) can be either O-STBC [47] for transmit
diversity or SM [56] for achieving high data rate. Let SD and SM be respectively the index
sets of the O-STBC and SM users, with QD := |SD| and QM := |SM | denoting the respective
cardinalities. Specifically, QD and QM are respectively the numbers of the O-STBC users
and SM users so that Q = QD + QM . At each O-STBC terminal, consecutive P symbols
of the data stream are spatially and temporally encoded according to [47], and are then
transmitted across N antenna elements over K time periods. During the same signaling
epochs each SM user then sends NK independent symbols; there are thus in total
LT := PQD +NKQM (3.1)
data symbols transmitted from the Q users every K symbol periods. The two ST signaling
schemes in the considered system can be completely described by the associated N ×K ST
codeword matrices. A commonly used codeword description is the linear matrix modula-
tion representation [4]. Let us divide the data stream of the qth user sq(k) into groups of
substreams as sq,l(k) := sq(Lqk + l − 1), l = 1, 2, . . . , Lq, where the number of substreams
Lq depends on the signaling mode chosen for the qth user so that Lq = P if q ∈ SD and
Lq = NK if q ∈ SM . Then the codeword matrix of the qth user can be written as
Xq(k) :=
2Lq∑
l=1
Aq,ls˜q,l(k), (3.2)
in which Aq,l ∈ CN×K is the ST modulation matrix, the split real-valued symbols s˜q,l(k) :=
Re {sq,l(k)} for l = 1, 2, . . . , Lq and s˜q,l(k) := Im
{
sq,l−Lq(k)
}
for l = Lq + 1, Lq + 2, . . . , 2Lq.
71
3.2.2 Vectorized Signal Model
To facilitate the detection and analysis, we consider the equivalent vectorized signal
model (2.77) as described in Section 2.4.1. Without loss of generality we assume that, for
each q ∈ SM , the NK symbols sq,l(k)’s are renumbered so that the nth group of K symbols,
namely, sq,l(k) for l = (n−1)K+1, (n−1)K+2, . . . , nK, are precisely those sent via the nth
transmit antenna (n = 1, 2, . . . , N). Through linearly combining the received signal yc(k)
with Hc, we can obtain the MF signal vector (2.80), and we will thus detect the transmitted
data streams based on the MF model (2.80). To better manifest the core ideas, throughout
the context we will focus on the real-valued constellation case, and hence K = P so that
LT := PQD + PNQM . There are essentially the same results (see Appendices B and D) for
our reports whenever complex-valued constellations are used.
3.3 Matched-Filtered Channel Matrix
For the particular MU STBC system, it can be easily shown that all the P × P block
submatrices of MFCM F are orthogonal designs [47]. For the considered dual-signaling
platform, in which the SM signaling could induce severe coupling effects against the O-STBC
signals, the structure of the resultant F could largely deviate from that of the MU STBC
system. As we will see in what follows, the matrix F in the dual-signaling environment,
however, does preserve the appealing block orthogonal structure. This fact is primarily the
guts for developing a group-wise OSIC detector.
To characterize F, we should note that its diagonal submatrices (of appropriate dimen-
sions) are basically the effective MF signal components of the Q users’ streams, whereas
the off diagonal submatrices account for the inter-user signal interference. In view of this
observation, one can thus classify the block submatrices of F based on these signal and inter-
ference “signatures”. As such, the linear matrix modulation representation of the codeword
matrices (3.2) will allow a systematic way of computing these signature matrices and, based
73
to see that the (i, j)th P × P submatrix of Fp,q, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N , characterizes the coupling
effect between the data streams transmitted from the ith antenna of the pth user and from
the jth antenna of the qth user; for p = q and i = j, this is precisely the single-antenna SM
signal signature. Since spatial multiplexing does not impose any spatial and temporal coding
structure among the transmitted data, the interference between any pair of SM streams sent
from two different antennas, and the respective signal components, would appear to be
spatially and temporally decoupled. Hence, as evidenced by (2), the resultant signatures
are diagonal matrices; the diagonal entries are all equal since the propagation channels
are assumed to be static during K signaling instants. The independently-distributed SM
streams, on the other hand, might interfere against the O-STBC signals to induce a coupling
matrix that is no longer orthogonal. Part (3) of Lemma 3.3.1 shows that the resultant
coupling signature is nonetheless block-wise an orthogonal design. To interpret this result,
we first note that a single-antenna SM stream may only temporally interfere with an O-STBC
codeword. The temporally-decoupled nature of SM data is likely to render the temporal
correlation of O-STBC streams unchanged, resulting in an orthogonal type signature. The
above discussions show that the symbol stream from a single SM antenna will introduce a set
of diagonal blocks (the coupling among the same SM type streams) and a set of orthogonal
design blocks (the coupling against the O-STBC signals) in the MFCM F. This result relies
solely on the multiplexing nature among all the NQM signals, irrespective of the number
of transmit antennas placed on each SM terminal. In light of this observation, the asserted
structure of the matrix F will be preserved particularly when single-antenna cell users are
present, as long as each one transmits independent symbols along his own antenna.
Since a matrix being a scalar multiple of IP is essentially a P × P orthogonal design,
Lemma 3.3.1 asserts that in the dual-signaling case, the MFCM F does consist of orthogonal
design based block submatrices. The presence of SM terminals thus substantially preserves
the block orthogonal structure of F. In the next section this fact will be exploited for
developing a group-wise OSIC detector for the considered MU dual-signaling system.
75
[56]. Based on Lemma 3.3.1, in what follows we will show that the OSIC ordering in each
processing layer sorts the symbol streams to be detected into a group-wise basis, which in
turn results in a group-wise detector realization.
1) Zero-Forcing (ZF) Criterion: In the ZF OSIC detection, the optimal detection
order at each step is determined by the index of the symbol decision statistics yielding
maximal post-detection SNR [56]. Based on the MF signal model (2.80), the ZF decision
vector in the initial stage is
sd(k) := F
−1z(k) = sc(k) + F−1v(k). (3.4)
Equation (3.4) shows that, for l = 1, 2, . . . , LT , the lth symbol decision statistics, that is,
the lth component of F−1z(k), is simply the desired symbol contaminated by the additive
noise eTl F
−1v(k), where el is the lth unit standard vector in RLT . It is straightforward to
compute the noise power as
σ20,l := E
{∣∣eTl F−1v(k)∣∣2} = σ2v2 eTl F−1el. (3.5)
Since all the transmitted symbols are of equal variance, (3.4) and (3.5) imply that the
(average) SNR in the lth decision statistics is completely determined by the lth diagonal
entry of the noise covariance F−1. In particular, a small [F−1]l,l (the lth diagonal entry of
F−1) implies a large SNR, and hence better detection accuracy attained by the lth branch.
As a result, the optimal detection order at the initial stage, which specifies the symbol
with slightest noise corruption, is obtained by searching for the index l = 1, 2, . . . , LT at
which [F−1]l,l is minimal. As a result, the optimal index can be found as long as one can
explicitly know the diagonal entries of the inverse matrix F−1. In the next theorem we will
see that the matrix F−1 “inherits” the key features of F as established in Lemma 3.3.1.
This result directly alleviates the efforts to search for the optimal index, and allows for a
group-wise detection strategy. Also, this will lead to a very efficient procedure for computing
the weighting matrices for recovering the symbol groups.
We need the following notation. For a fixed symbol block length P and a positive integer
L, let us define F(L) to be the set of all invertible real symmetric PL × PL matrices such
77
can be directly verified that, at the ith stage, where i = 1, 2, . . . , L− 1, the noise covariance
matrix associated with ZF decision statistics vector is
F−1i :=
(
HTc,iHc,i
)−1 ∈ R(LT−iP )×(LT−iP ), (3.7)
where Hc,i is obtained by deleting i block(s) of P columns (corresponding to the previously
detected signals) from Hc. Since Fi = H
T
c,iHc,i ∈ R(LT−iP )×(LT−iP ) is simply obtained by
deleting the associated i block(s) of P columns and rows from F, the matrix Fi exhibits the
same algebraic structure as F. More precisely, we have Fi ∈ F(L − i), and so is F−1i by
Lemma 3.4.1. This shows that the P (L − i) diagonal entries of F−1i take on only (L − i)
different levels and, by following the previous analysis, group-wise detection can thus be
done at each processing step.
2) Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) Criterion: The MMSE OSIC order-
ing at each layer picks up the symbol attaining the minimal mean square error for detection.
At the initial stage, the joint MMSE weight that minimizes the metric
ε0 := E
{∥∥sc(k)−WT0 z(k)∥∥22} , (3.8)
is obtained as
W0 =
[
F+
σ2v
2
ILT
]−1
. (3.9)
It is easy to compute the lth symbol mean square error, i.e.,
ε0,l := E
{∣∣eTl [sc(k)−WT0 z(k)]∣∣2} = eTl [( 2σ2v
)
F+ ILT
]−1
el. (3.10)
Equation (3.10) shows that the optimal MMSE OSIC ordering is determined by the index
of the minimal diagonal entry of [(2/σ2v)F+ ILT ]
−1
. Since F ∈ F(L) and adding diagonal
perturbation ILT to a scaled F essentially preserves the block orthogonal structure, it follows
immediately that [(2/σ2v)F+ ILT ] ∈ F(L) and so is [(2/σ2v)F+ ILT ]−1 by Lemma 3.4.1. The
PL symbol mean square errors (diagonal entries of [(2/σ2v)F+ ILT ]
−1
) can thus be catego-
rized into L groups of constant elements, one associated with a symbol group transmitted
79
users but is subject to possible noise enhancement, whereas the MMSE criterion fo-
cuses on joint suppression of interference and noise. Although the two design metrics
resort to different strategies for symbol recovery, in the considered scenario they both
lead to the appealing group-wise detection property. This is because the respective
optimal detection orders in each processing layer, as shown in the above discussions,
are determined by the diagonal entries of certain structured matrices belonging to the
family F(L) (this is also a unique feature pertaining to O-STBC).
(D4) Another dual-signaling environment is seen in the mono-link systems recently consid-
ered in [107], in which a subset of antenna elements are selected for transmitting the
Alamouti coded streams, while the others are left for spatial multiplexing. It is noted
that, in this single-user scenario, the (antenna-wise) symbol synchronization assump-
tion is typically satisfied, and the proposed group-wise OSIC detector can be used for
separating the multi-antenna symbol streams.
3.4.3 Conservation of Spatial Resource: CDMA Based Implemen-
tation
In the current framework, the assumption on the number of receive antennas M ≥
QD + NQM is needed since only the spatial resource is employed for removing the multi-
access interference (MAI). This requirement seems critical in practice because M could
be prohibitively large in a user-dense environment. A typical approach to conserving the
spatial resource is to alternatively adopt the multi-access techniques, e.g., CDMA, for MAI
mitigation [14]. Basically, the MAI can be effectively suppressed through chip despreading,
as long as all the cell user are assigned with distinct spreading (signature) codes; in this
case, only M ≥ N receive antennas are required in order to separate the symbol streams
for each SM user. However, since the code resource could usually be limited, especially
for the high-speed demand in which small spreading gains are preferred, some users may
81
3.5.1 Computation of F−1
Recall from Theorem 3.4.1 that every P × P block off-diagonal submatrix of F−1 is
a P × P orthogonal design, and each diagonal block is sparse (it is a scalar multiple of
IP ). This imposes certain structural redundancy in F
−1 that should be carefully tackled
for avoiding the computation of duplicate parameters. Indeed, since a P × P orthogonal
design is completely characterized by P independent variables [47], it suffices to determine
one column, say, the last one, for each off-diagonal block submatrix; the rest columns can
simply be obtained from the last one through some known linear transformations [47]. For
each diagonal block, in particular, only one unknown needs to be found. The aforementioned
a priori structural information shows that, to completely specify F−1, we only need to find
its (jP )th columns for 1 ≤ j ≤ L: this amounts to solving the linear equations of reduced
dimensions
FG = E, (3.11)
in which G and E are LT × L matrices whose lth columns are, respectively, the (jP )th
columns of F−1 and the identity matrix ILT . To solve for the unknown G based on (3.11),
one can further take into account the sparse nature of G. Specifically, for the jth column
gj, we must have gi,j = 0 for (j − 1)P + 1 ≤ i ≤ jP − 1; the imbedded P − 1 consecutive
zero entries in gj come from the last column of the jth P × P diagonal block of F−1. As
a result, only the nonzero entries are to be determined. Moreover, since F−1 is Hermitian,
in each gj, we only have to compute the entries lying below gjP−1,j(= 0). In summary, for
the jth column gj, only the last P (L− j) + 1 entries are to be determined. It is noted that
the number of unknowns is decreased by an amount of P as the column index j increases to
j + 1 (for the last column gjP−1, only one unknown is yet to be computed).
To incorporate the above structural information for solving (3.11), let F = LLT , where
L is an LT × LT lower triangular matrix, be a Cholesky factorization [97] of the matrix F;
such a factorization is typically required for inverting a nonsingular square real symmetric
83
whereM is the number of receive antennas withM ≥ L. For the proposed method, according

dimension. In fact, the efforts to invert this P × P matrix can be reduced even further. To
see this, we need the next result.
Theorem 3.5.1. Let Bi−1 and F¯i−1 be defined in (3.18) and (3.19), respectively. Then it
follows that BTi−1F¯i−1Bi−1 = λi−1IP for some scalar λi−1. ¥
Proof: For a fixed i, let us define J := L− i. For 1 ≤ k, l ≤ J , denote by Uk,l the (k, l)th
P ×P block submatrix of F¯i−1. We drop the index indicating the dependency of J and Uk,l
on the number of stage i− 1 to simplify notation. Let us write Bi−1 =
[
BT1 ,B
T
1 , . . . ,B
T
J
]T
,
where Bk ∈ O(P ); then it follows immediately that
Bi− 1T F¯i−1Bi−1 =
J∑
k,l=1
BTkUk,lBl =
J∑
k=1
BTkUk,kBk +
J∑
k,l=1, k 6=l
BTkUk,lBl. (3.21)
Since F¯i−1 ∈ F(J), we have by definition Uk,k = ηkIk for some scalar ηk: the first summation
on the right-hand-side of the second equality in (3.21) thus simplifies as
∑J
k=1B
T
kUk,kBk =∑J
k=1 ηkB
T
kBk = ηIP for some scalar η. On the other hand, it can be shown that B
T
kUk,lBk ∈
O(P ) [47], and this implies BTkUk,kBl+BTl Ul,kBk = αk,lIP for some scalar αk,l. As a result,
we have
∑
k,l=1, k 6=lB
T
kUk,lBl = η˜IP for some scalar η˜, and the assertion follows.
Theorem 3.5.1 implies
BTi−1F¯i−1Bi−1 + di−1IP = ci−1IP , (3.22)
and, from (3.20), we reach the following key equation for inverting the matrix F−1i
F−1i = F¯i−1 − c−1i−1F¯i−1Bi−1BTi−1F¯i−1. (3.23)
Given Fi−1 and F−1i−1, equation (3.23) provides a simple recursive formula for computing
F−1i without any direct matrix inversion operations. The proposed recursive approach for
computing F−1i is basically a block based implementation of the method in [108] introduced
for the conventional symbol-wise OSIC algorithm. A distinctive feature of our scheme,
nonetheless, is the attractive simplification of (3.20) to (3.23), with which the computation
of the P × P inverse matrix (BTi−1F¯i−1Bi−1 + di−1IP )−1 in (3.20) boils down to finding the

F can further simplify the process of flop evaluations. It is also noted that, for a system
with QM SM users and QD O-STBC users, there are totally (QD +NQM)!/[(QD)!(NQM)!]
group OSIC orderings. Due to the imbedded sparse nature of F, the required flop counts will
be different for distinct sorting sequences. A reasonable complexity measure of the OSIC
detector, therefore, would be the mean flop counts, averaged over all the possible orderings,
but this turns out to be highly intractable. A sensible approximation to the exact mean flop
counts is the average of the minimal and maximal costs. The detection orders allowing for
the least computational effort must entail an utmost benefit from the sparse structure in
per layer processing. The solutions are therefore the sorting sequences in which exactly all
the QD O-STBC streams are to be detected in the initial QD layers; as such, all the dense
blocks in F resulting from the QD diversity users will be removed after the first QD stages
and, meanwhile, the sparse structure is retained as much as possible in each processing layer.
The detection orders incurring the highest complexity demand, on the other hand, will be
the particular choices which decide to recover all the NQM SM signals in the initial NQM
stages. This will leave as many as possible the dense blocks in each Fi for i > 1, hence the
smallest possible sparse region to be exploited for computational reduction. The average
flop cost of two extreme cases is listed in Table 3.2 (the flop counts of the Naguib’s and
Stamoulis’s methods are also obtained in essentially the same manner). The computed flop
costs of the three methods are listed in Table 3.2 (see the first three rows).
Example 3.5.1: Considering the QPSK modulation (i.e., D = 2) and choosing N = 2
(thus P = K = 2), QD = QM = 2, L = 6, we have the result: CNaguib ≈ 4336, CStamoulis ≈
6448 and CGroup ≈ 1083, and this yields the approximate ratio of complexity of 4 : 6 : 1 for
Naguib’s 2-step method, Stamoulis’s method and proposed group-wise OSIC method. As
we can see, the proposed solution requires less computation. ¥

dimension. Since the detection order in this way may violate the actual optimal sorting,
such a “two-stage” processing strategy can reduce computation at the expense of a possible
performance drop. The computational cost of such an approach is also included in Table
3.2, based on which the amount of flop reduction with respect to the original method can
be found as

Given the system parameters considered in Example 3.5.1, the two-stage approach reduces
about a 47% computational complexity associated with the original method with optimal
ordering.
3.7 Simulation Results
In this section we use several numerical simulations to illustrate the performance of the
proposed group-wise OSIC detector. Each user’s channel is quasi-static: it remains constant
over each packet of 100 symbol blocks and independently varies between packets. Also,
perfect channel knowledge at the receiver is assumed. In all simulations, the transmit power
of all users are set to be equal (i.e., P1 = P2 = · · · = PQ = PT ) and define SNR := PT/σ2v (as
defined in [10], [48], [54], [62], [65], [68]); the number of receiver antennas M is set to meet
the minimal requirement, i.e., M = L = QD +NQM .
A. MU STBC Systems with Alamouti’s Code
This simulation considers the special MU STBC case (with Alamouti’s code) and eval-
uates the performances of the proposed method with the Stamoulis’s method [79] and the
91
experiment compares the performances of the above three detection schemes in the dual-
signaling environment. Figure 3.5 (a) (b), respectively, show the average BER of the two
detected O-STBC users (the K-factors in the two Ricean channels are both set to be K = 10,
which corresponds to a medium eigenvalue spread = 5.3) and the two SM users. Compared
with Figure 3.4, we can see that the BER curves in the dual-singling case exhibit similar
tendency as in the MU STBC systems; the proposed MMSE group-wise OSIC achieves the
best performance as long as SNR is above 10 dB. It is noted that the performance of the
proposed two-stage processing scheme (for further computational reduction) is comparable
to that of the Naguib’s two-step method; however, it incurs a 3 dB loss in SNR at BER
= 10−3 for O-STBC users and 1.5 ∼ 2 dB for SM users as compared with the original
method (with optimal ordering). The second experiment simulates the BER performances
of three representative detection schemes (the ordered Stamoulis’s method, the Naguib’s
two-step method, and the proposed group-wise MMSE OSIC) at different channel correlation
tendencies. For the two Ricean channels, we consider five different Ricean K-factors: 0, 1, 10,
30, and 100 (large K implies severe correlations; the extreme selections K = 0 and K = 100,
respectively, render the channel to be independent fading and almost light-of-sight). Figures
3.6 (a) (b) show the average BER of the two classes of detected streams for different K
factors. It can be seen that the performances in all cases deteriorate as K increases. This
is not unexpected since the O-STBC scheme may lose the diversity gain over the correlated
channels, and large K factor thus incurs large BER degradation. The performance drop of
the SM scheme may result from the increased amount of error propagation due to the poorly
detected O-STBC streams caused by the loss in diversity gain over low-rank channels. The
figure also shows that, for a fixed SNR, the proposed group-wise MMSE OSIC seems to incur
less BER spread as K increases. This could benefit from the OSIC mechanism, in which the
detect-and-cancel process induces more receive diversity and improves detection accuracy in
each layer, leading to better average performance against severe spatial correlation.

under the same number of transmit antennas, the OSIC detector allows a “user-wise” joint
detection property. By borrowing from this detection framework, it is shown in this chapter
that an “antenna group-wise” detection property can be applied to the real-valued constella-
tions in the proposed G-STBC system. However, for the complex-valued constellations, it is
shown that the per-antenna group detection property will fail leading to an increase in com-
putational complexity. To remedy this, we then propose an appropriate OSIC detector to
guarantee the antenna group-wise detection property for the possible codeword structures of
G-STBCs. Moreover, a computationally efficient recursion based implementation associated
with such an OSIC detector is then developed based on the distinctive structure embed-
ded in the MFCM to further alleviate the detection computational load. Finally, we study
the codeword structures and propose an optimal codeword selection criterion based on the
minimum BER performance under the fixed total transmit power and total SE. Numerical
examples are used to illustrate the performance of the proposed G-STBCs and corresponding
OSIC detector.
The rest of the chapter is organized as follows. Section 4.2 describes the system model and
some basic assumptions for G-STBC system. Section 4.3 investigates the embedded struc-
tures of MFCM and develops an antenna group-wise OSIC detection scheme based on the
distinctive structures of MFCM for real-valued constellations. On the contrast, Section 4.4
gives a development of a particular semi-antenna group-wise OSIC detection algorithm for
complex-valued constellations. The implementation issues for complex-valued constellations
including the antenna group-wise OSIC solution, two-stage detection strategy and computa-
tionally efficient recursion based realization are then presented in Section 4.5. In Section 4.6,
the codeword structures, properties and selection criterion of G-STBCs are studied. Finally,
Section 4.7 shows the simulation examples, and Section 4.8 concludes the chapter. Most of
the mathematical details required in our discussions are relegated to the appendix.

even if K > Kq. Moreover, splitting the source symbols into the real and imaginary parts
will also unify both the problem formulation and the underlying analysis, regardless of the
number of antennas of each group Nq and symbol constellations.
Collecting received signal vector y(k) := [y1(k), y2(k), . . . , yM(k)]
T ∈ CM over K succes-
sive symbol periods, we have the M ×K ST signal model (2.72) with N being replaced by
Nq (assuming that the Q antenna groups are symbol synchronized). Note that in (2.72) Pq is
the transmit power of the qth antenna group so that P1+P2+ · · ·+PQ = PT , with PT being
the total transmit power, Hq is an M ×Nq MIMO matrix channel from the qth antenna
group to the receiver, and V(k) ∈ CM×K is the channel noise. The following assumptions
are also made in the sequel.
(a1) The symbol streams sq(k), q = 1, 2, . . . , Q, are i.i.d. with zero-mean and unit-variance.
(a2) Each entry of the MIMO matrix channel Hq, q = 1, 2, . . . , Q, is an i.i.d. complex
Gaussian random variable with zero-mean and unit-variance, and assumed to be static
during the K signaling periods.
(a3) The noise V(k) is spatially and temporally white, each entry being with zero-mean
and variance σ2v .
(a4) Equal power allocation for all groups is assumed, i.e., P1 = P2 = · · · = PQ = PTQ .
(a5) Assume that 2 ≤ Nq ≤ 4 and hence, according to [47], the symbol block length
Bq ∈ {2, 4}. The proposed approach is exclusively applicable to this scenario.
(a6) For 3 ≤ Nq ≤ 4 with complex-valued constellations, the half rate codes [47] are used.
(a7) The number of receive antennas is chosen so that M ≥ Q.
4.2.2 Real-Valued Vectorized Signal Model
To facilitate the detection and analysis, we again consider the equivalent (real-valued)
vectorized signal model built in Section 2.4.1. Since the number of transmit antennas is
105
3), for real-valued symbol constellations.
4.3.1 Matched-Filtered Channel Matrix
Denote that Fq,q and Fp,q are the signal signature of the qth antenna group and the inter-
group interference between the pth and the qth antenna groups, respectively. To characterize
the structures of Fq,q and Fp,q, or equivalently F, we might have to gather each piece of entry
and put them altogether to examine how Fq,q and Fp,q are actually like. This can be done
through the following lemma. In the sequel, we denote by O(K) the set of all K × K
real orthogonal designs with K independent values as specified in [47]. Also, we denote by
O(K,L) the set of all K ×K real orthogonal designs with L independent values.
Lemma 4.3.1. Consider the real-valued constellations with 2 ≤ Np, Nq ≤ 4. According to
[47], we get K ∈ {2, 4}. Let Fp,q be the (p, q)th Lp × Lq block submatrix of F, where F is
defined in (2.81). Then we have Fq,q = αqIK and Fp,q ∈ O(K) whenever p 6= q. ¥
Proof: See Appendix F.
Precisely, Lemma 4.3.1 specifies that for p 6= q:
(p1) When K = 2, it turns out N1 = N2 = · · · = NQ = 2. Then we have Fp,q ∈ O(2).
(p2) WhenK = 4 and Np = Nq = 2, then each 2×2 block diagonal submatrix of Fp,q ∈ R4×4
belongs to an orthogonal design and each 2× 2 block off-diagonal submatrix of Fp,q is
a zero matrix. As a result, we have Fp,q ∈ O(4, 2).
(p3) When K = 4 and 2 ≤ Np, Nq ≤ 4 but Np 6= Nq 6= 2, then we have Fp,q ∈ O(4).
The results of Lemma 4.3.1 are summarized in Table 4.1. Part (p1) of Lemma 4.3.1 is
known from [47] and is exploited in Chapter 3 for developing a user-wise OSIC detector in
the MU STBC systems. The significance of Lemma 4.3.1 lies in Part (p2) and Part (p3),
which are more relevant to the G-STBC systems. In particular, Part (p2) and Part (p3)

for k 6= l. Therefore, Theorem 4.3.1 is in fact an immediate consequence of the following
result by setting L = Q.
Lemma 4.3.2. If F ∈ FKL(L), then so is F−1. ¥
Proof: Also see Appendix A.
Theorem 4.3.1 shows that the total KL diagonal entries of F−1 assume L = Q distinct
levels β0,l, l = 1, 2, . . . , L, that is
diag

K entries
, . . . , β0,L, . . . , β0,L︸ ︷︷ ︸
K entries
}. (4.3)
From (4.3), we can see that it suffices to search among the L values, one associated with a
particular “antenna group” (or say the layer in the standard V-BLAST detection), for the
optimal detection order. Therefore, we can simultaneously detect a block of K symbols at
the initial stage, with the optimal detection order being given by (3.6), and the ZF weighting
matrix can be computed from the corresponding indexed columns of F−1 as
W0 = F
−1 [eK(l¯0−1)+1 · · · eK(l¯0−1)+K] ∈ RLK×K . (4.4)
The detected signal is then cancelled from the received signal (2.77), yielding a “modified”
signal model for detection at the next stage.
With such a detect-and-cancel procedure followed by an associated linear combining of
the resultant signal (2.80), it can be directly verified that, at the ith stage, i = 1, 2, . . . , L−1,
the noise covariance matrix is of the form F−1i . From Section 3.4.1, we can see that Fi ∈
FKL(L − i), and using Lemma 4.3.2, it can be immediately shown that F−1i ∈ FKL(L − i),
which implies that

where βi,l is the lth distinct value distributed on the diagonal of F
−1
i . As a result, a block
of K symbols transmitted from a particular antenna group can be jointly detected at each
stage building to an antenna group-wise OSIC detection property.

Lemma 4.4.1. Consider the complex-valued constellations with 2 ≤ Np, Nq ≤ 4. According
to [47], we get K ∈ {2, 8}. Let Fp,q be the (p, q)th 2Lp × 2Lq block submatrix of F, where F
is defined in (2.81). Then the following results hold.
(p1) When K = 2, it turns out N1 = N2 = · · · = NQ = 2. Then we have Fq,q = αqI4 and
Fp,q ∈ O(4) whenever p 6= q.
(p2) When K = 8 and Np = Nq = 2, then Fq,q = αqI16 and Fp,q ∈ R16×16 with F(s,t)p,q ∈
O(8, 2), s, t = 1, 2, whenever p 6= q. Moreover, we have F(1,1)p,q = F(2,2)p,q and F(1,2)p,q =
−F(2,1)p,q .
(p3) When K = 8 and Np = 2, 3 ≤ Nq ≤ 4, then Fq,q = αqI2Lq and Fp,q ∈ R16×8 with
F
(s,t)
p,q ∈ O(4), s = 1, . . . , 4, t = 1, 2, whenever p 6= q. Moreover, we have F(1,1)p,q = F(2,1)p,q ,

p,q = F

p,q , F
(1,2)
p,q = −F(2,2)p,q and F(3,2)p,q = −F(4,2)p,q .
(p4) When K = 8 and 3 ≤ Np, Nq ≤ 4, then Fq,q = αqI8 and Fp,q ∈ R8×8 with F(1,1)p,q =
F
(2,2)
p,q ∈ O(4) and F(1,2)p,q = F(2,1)p,q = O4, whenever p 6= q. In this case, Fp,q ∈ O(8, 4). ¥
Proof: See Appendix G.
Based on Lemma 4.4.1, following facts are asserted.
Fact 4.4.1. From Lemma 4.4.1, we have
(f1) If K = 8 and Np = Nq = 2, then F
T
p,qFp,q = Fp,qF

p,q = cI16 for some scalar c.

and c2. ¥
The results of Lemma 4.4.1 are summarized in Table 4.2. From Lemma 4.4.1, it is
shown that each “4 × 4” (minimum size) submatrix of F belongs to an orthogonal design.
It is worth to note that, from Lemma 4.3.1 and Lemma 4.4.1, Fp,q will be a square matrix

stage. One antenna group thus includes two decision groups by assumption, each of which
has Lq real-valued symbols. Let Ii,1 and Ii,1/2 be the respective index sets of decision group
for unit-rate codes and half-rate codes, with Gi,1 := |Ii,1| and Gi,2 := |Ii,1/2| denoting the
respective cardinalities. Also, let Ii := Ii,1 ∪ Ii,1/2 be the index set of total decision groups,
with Gi := |Ii| denoting the corresponding cardinality. Then we have the facts
Ii =
 Ii,1 if Ii ∩ Ii,1/2 = ∅,Ii,1/2 if Ii ∩ Ii,1 = ∅. (4.6)
On the other hand, let us to partition the diagonal entries of Fi into Gi decision groups,
each of which has the same (nonzero) value, namely
diag (Fi) = {αi,1, . . . , αi,1︸ ︷︷ ︸
1st group: Gi,1
, αi,2, . . . , αi,2︸ ︷︷ ︸
2nd group: Gi,2
, . . . , αi,G, . . . , αi,Gi︸ ︷︷ ︸
Gthi group: Gi,Gi
}
:= {Gi,1,Gi,2, . . . ,Gi,Gi} . (4.7)
Assume that {αi,g}Gig=1 exhibit Di(Gi) different levels with
dGi/2e ≤ Di(Gi) ≤ Gi, (4.8)
where Di is a function of Gi. This is because that when the diagonal entries of Fi have
Gi decision groups, there will exist Gi − dGi/2e + 1 possible outcomes that have different
number of levels presenting on the diagonal of Fi. Hence, Di(Gi) will also has Gi−dGi/2e+1
possible different values, depending on which outcome of Gi decision groups occurs. For a
concise notation presentation, in the following, we drop the dependence Gi of Di(Gi).
Next, let us define F˜J(G,D) to be the set of all invertible real symmetric J ×J matrices,
where J , G, D are the positive integers, so that, for X ∈ F˜J(G,D), we have (1) each
block diagonal submatrix of X is a (nonzero) scaled identity matrix αgIMg , g = 1, . . . , G,
with Mg ∈ {2, 4, 8}, (2) {αg}Gg=1 exhibit D different values, with dG/2e ≤ D ≤ G, (3) for
i, j = 1, . . . , G, i 6= j, each 4 × 4 block submatrix of Mi ×Mj block off-diagonal submatrix
of X belongs to O(4) or is a zero matrix. Moreover, if D = G, then F˜J(G,D = G) will be
simplified as F˜J(G).

in the corresponding yet-to-be-detected antenna group. As a result, to completely detect
the 2Lq real-valued symbols associated with a particular antenna group, such a detection
manner might double the computational load compared to the antenna group-wise detection
property, so that the overall detection complexity is at most the double of the antenna
group-wise detection property.
For example, partitioning the N = 8 transmit antennas into three groups which are
allocated with 2, 2 and 4 antennas, respectively, and the corresponding code rates are 1,
1 and 1/2 leads to the required number of stages L for optimal ordering performed in the
OSIC based detection mentioned above will be bounded by 4 ≤ L ≤ 6. On the contrary, if
we perform the antenna group-wise OSIC detection, only three stages may be sufficient to
detect all the transmitted symbols.
Remark: For complex-valued constellations with 3 ≤ Nq ≤ 4, the more spectral efficient
orthogonal codes (or called the delay optimal codes) are the 3/4-rate codes [47], [94]. It is
known in the literatures that these codes provide the highest code rate. However, with such
the codes used, by going through essentially the same procedures as what we have done in
the proof of Theorem 4.4.1, it can be shown that all the diagonal entries of F−1i will result
in different values from each other. This will lose the capability of the appealing group-wise
detection property and thus induce a relatively large detection computational load. From
this observation and based on the tradeoff between the performance and computational load,
we hence do not consider such the codes.
Remark: The Naguib’s [78] and Stamoulis’s [79] methods are two popular interference
suppression/signal detection algorithms for the MU STBC systems. Based on the block
orthogonal structure embedded in F as specified in Lemma 4.3.1 and 4.4.1, the two methods
can also be realized in the aforementioned system. In the numerical results, we will consider
the two methods to evaluate the detection performance of the proposed OSIC based detector.

sorting, such a simple processing strategy can reduce computation at the expense of a possible
performance drop. However, as we will see in the simulation results, the performance drop
is not critical. Note that this type of processing strategy is unique through the use of
real-valued representation of signal model shown in Section 4.2.2.
4.5.2 Two-Stage Detection Strategy
As mentioned in Section 4.4.2, if the group code rates among the yet-to-be-detected
antenna groups are different, the antenna group-wise detection property will be fail and thus
may increase the detection complexity. However, as the group code rates are the same, it
will reduce to the antenna group-wise OSIC detection. An appropriate solution to solve this
problem can be done based on the following two-stage processing. (1) We first categorize
the antenna groups into two classes based on code rate: one class for high-rate (unit-rate)
code (i.e., Nq = 2) and another for low-rate (half-rate) code (i.e., Nq = 3 or Nq = 4). (2)
Detect the symbols based on class-by-class manner. To this end, we must explicitly know
which class should be detected first. Fortunately, since all the N transmit antennas are
partitioned into several small groups, each of which places two, three or four antennas and
is ST encoded based on O-STBC, the transmit diversity advantages obtained from these
groups may be different leading to different BER performances among these groups. This
fact will consequentially dominate the detection order in the proposed OSIC biased detection.
Theoretically, the antenna group that has the higher diversity advantage (i.e., larger Nq) is
robust against the channel impairments and can thus be detected first. From this point
of view, we propose a “two-stage” detection strategy, in which the low-rate antenna groups
(Nq = 3 or Nq = 4) are detected first through the OSIC detection algorithm and then for low-
rate ones (Nq = 2), to further reduce the detection computational complexity. Likewise, due
to the non-optimal detection ordering, such a detection strategy may also cause a possible
performance loss, but this performance loss is slight and within an acceptable regain (see the
simulation results for illustration). Note that in the first processing stage, since the different
117
will be shown in what follows how the knowledge of the embedded structures of F, and its
inverse F−1, can further help to alleviate the computations.
Specifically, with the spatial structure of F given, there is an efficient way of finding F−1
by solving a set of linear equations of relatively small dimensions based on the Cholesky
factorization [97]. Moreover, the inverse matrix required at each stage could be recursively
computed based on the parameters available in the previous stage. This is because that the
computation of F−1i can be directly and completely obtained from the information of F
−1
i−1
and Fi−1 (see Section 3.5.1).
In the proof of Theorem 4.4.1, it is shown that the minimum dimension that can form
an orthogonal matrix in F−1p,q is four, where F
−1
p,q ∈ R2Lp×2Lq is the (p, q)th block submatrix
of F−1. Since the recursion based implementation can only tackle a block orthogonal matrix
once at a time, as the matrix dimension of F is large, directly implement the recursion
based processing for the semi-antenna group-wise OSIC detection described in Section 4.4
may need more stages. Fortunately, the two-stage detection strategy, which detects the low
rate codes first and then for high rate codes, can help to reduce the required number of
stages. As a result, in the following we will develop the recursive implementation based on
the two-stage detection strategy. To this end, we assume that: (1) there are two levels on
the diagonal entries of F−1i within an antenna group at each stage, (2) the last column and
row blocks of Fi = H
T
c,iHc,i corresponding to the desired signature of an antenna group are
to be deleted (i.e., to be detected) at the ith stage, and (3) the antenna groups with three
or four antennas are first detected. With F−10 := F
−1 obtained at the initial stage, in what
follows we will show how F−1i at each stage can be recursively computed based on Fi−1 and
F−1i−1. Denote by Fi ∈ R2(LT−

is the symbol block length of the qth group to be deleted at the ith stage. Then Fi−1 can
119
reduces the detection computational load. Note that the good property described in (4.17)
is unique for the two-stage detection. If we detect the symbols without the use of two-stage
strategy, the result of BTi−1F¯i−1Bi−1 is no longer a diagonal matrix, and we will thus need
some matrix inversions or more stages for symbol detection leading to an additional increase
in computational complexity. It is also noticed that as the antenna groups placed three
or four antennas detected, based on the two-stage detection property we have c1,i = c2,i in
equation (4.17). The proposed recursive algorithm for antenna group-wise OSIC detection is
basically a block based realization of the method [108] applied to the conventional symbol-
wise OSIC detection. A distinctive feature proposed here is the key result (4.17) so that the
inverse of BTi−1F¯i−1Bi−1 +Di−1 in the computation of F
−1
i can be completely avoided.
4.6 Grouped Space-Time Block Codes
In G-STBC systems, with the antenna partition done, the code rate Rq associated with an
antenna group will thus be defined depending on the number of antennas Nq. Specifically,
combining the antenna group codewords into a “big” ST codeword induces the G-STBC.
To fulfil the block orthogonal matrix property for allowing a low-complexity group-wise
OSIC detection as described in Section 4.3 and 4.4, in what follows, we will develop a
computationally efficient G-STBCs regardless of the number of total transmit antennas N .
Based on the designed codewords, we then provide a code selection criterion to appropriately
choose the codewords in accordance with the link performance under the constraints of total
transmit power and SE.
4.6.1 Codeword Construction and Property
Since Lq symbols are transmitted from the qth antenna group over K symbol periods, or
in other words, there are in total LT data symbols are transmitted from N antennas over K
121
Example 4.6.1: When N = 10, there are JN = 5 possible antenna configuration sets:
SN = { (3, 3, 4)︸ ︷︷ ︸
SN1 : QN1 =3
, (2, 4, 4)︸ ︷︷ ︸
SN2 : QN2 =3
, (2, 2, 3, 3)︸ ︷︷ ︸
SN3 : QN3 =4
, (2, 2, 2, 4)︸ ︷︷ ︸
SN4 : QN4 =4
, (2, 2, 2, 2, 2)︸ ︷︷ ︸
SN5 : QN5 =5
}, (4.23)
and QNmin = dN/4e = 3, QNmax = bN/2c = 5. The corresponding code structures are shown
in Figure 4.2. With above example, some interpretations and discussions regarding the code
properties are as follows.
(a) Code Rate: As we can see from (4.23) that, SN1 and SN2 have the same number of
antenna groups, i.e., QN1 = Q
N
2 = 3, but different antenna configurations (3,3,4) and
(2,4,4). This is also observed from SN3 and SN4 . Specifically, according to (4.18), SN1
provides a code rate of 1.5 but SN2 provides a code rate of 2, and 3, 3.5 and 5 for SN3 , SN4
and SN5 , respectively, which means that, for a fixed N , different antenna configurations
may provide different code rates even under the same number of antenna groups.
(b) Diversity advantages: Different transmit diversity gains are provided by different
antenna configurations leading to different BER performances.
(c) Computational complexity: Based on the OSIC based detection described in Sec-
tion 4.3 and 4.4, the maximum required number of stages L¯N for data detection are
respective 3, 6, 8, 8 and 5, showing that different antenna configurations will also cause
different computational loads at the receiver.
As a result, for a fixed N , the code characteristics including the code rate, BER perfor-
mance and receiver computational complexity will be significantly affected by the antenna
configuration. In general, for a fixed N , an antenna configuration with more antenna groups
will provide higher code rate, but lower diversity advantage. However, for a fixed N and a
fixed Q, an antenna configuration with lower code rate does not necessarily provide a higher
diversity advantage, and the antenna configuration with larger difference among Nq’s may
not perform worse than that with small difference among Nq’s (see the computer simula-
tions). To evaluate the codeword performance, it should jointly consider the corresponding
123
selection criterion under this detection strategy. Also, by using the recursion based processing
for realizing the antenna group-wise detection, we will neglect the receiver computational
load for deriving the code selection criterion (note that different detection algorithm may
select different codeword). Then the optimal mode selection (i.e., code selection) criterion
under the given SNR constraint and SE η
(MNj ) can thus be found by searching the index
of candidate modes whose has the minimum BER performance
j = argmin
∀ j
Pe
(MNj | {SNR, η (MNj )}) . (4.25)
Since SE is a function of code rate RN and transmission bit rate Rb, for a fixed SE, specifying
Rb (i.e., modulation type) will specify R
N or the codeword. Then the codeword is preferred
if
j = argmin
∀ j
Pe
(SNj | {PT , Rb}) . (4.26)
This shows that the optimal codeword is chosen based on the candidate at which the antenna
configuration set SNj can achieve the minimum BER performance under the constraints of
total transmit power PT and transmission bit rate Rb.
Since the transmitted symbols of a particular antenna group are independent of those of
another group, the overall BER Pe can be calculated by averaging the BERs of all groups
Pe =

q=1
Pe,q, (4.27)
where Pe,q is the BER of the qth antenna group. By ignoring error propagation effects in all
interactions of OSIC detection [110], the BER of the qth antenna group can be approximated
as a function of the post-detection SINR γq depending on the adopted detection criterion
and transmission bit rate Rb,q

information is assumed to be available at the receiver but not at the transmitter. In all
simulations, unless otherwise mentioned, QPSK modulation is used. Finally, we assume
that the antenna groups are equal power and define SNR := PT/σ
2
v (as defined in [10], [48],
[54], [62], [65], [68]).
The first simulation evaluates the performance of the proposed OSIC based detection
and compares with the Naguib’s method [78] and Stamoulis’s method [79], which are the
two popular interference suppression/signal detection algorithms adopted in the MU STBC
systems. In this simulation, Q = 3 antenna groups are assumed at the transmitter and
M = 3 antenna elements are placed at the receiver. Figure 4.3 plots the BER performances
of the three detection schemes as a function of SNR. In Figure 4.3(a), total N = 6 transmit
antennas are used with the antenna configuration being SN = (2, 2, 2) (L¯N = 3), but in
Figure 4.3(b), N = 7 with SN = (2, 2, 3) are considered (L¯N = 6). As shown in Figures
4.3(a) and (b), the performances of all methods can be roughly separated into two groups.
The stamoulis’s method achieves the worst performance since it is a pure decouple based
algorithm and cannot enjoy the increased receive diversity gain as the algorithm goes on,
even it is combined with the power ordering strategy. The similar performance is also
confirmed by the Naguib’s one-step method. For the better performance group, on the
contrary, the Naguib’s two-step method provides a considerable performance at lower SNR
cases but it suffers from a performance degradation in the medium-to-high SNR cases due to
the PIC detection mechanism. The results also show that, in most SNR regions, the proposed
method can successfully suppress the interference and obtain the large diversity gain through
the SIC mechanism. To investigate the performance of the proposed OSIC based detection
algorithm for G-STBCs, in the rest of simulations, only the ZF OSIC detection is considered
for simplicity.
In the second simulation, the effects on the proposed detection strategies described in
Section 4.5.1 and 4.5.2 are evaluated for N = 8, M = 3, Q = 3 and SN = (2, 2, 4).
Both the actual and maximum (L¯N = 6) required numbers of stages performed in OSIC
127
function of SNR are plotted in Figure 4.5. As we can see from this figure, the pure O-STBC
technique has a performance limit in lower SNR regions due to the use of high order QAM
modulation. The pure SM technique also achieve a poor BER performance especially in
media-to-high SNR regions due to the small degrees-of-freedom for interference suppression
and the lower diversity advantages for mitigating the channel variation (no TD gain). How-
ever, the proposed technique provides a very excellent performance in all SNR cases. This
is because that the proposed technique in fact appropriately combines these two extreme
techniques and use a moderate modulation order (through (4.24)) to provide a better di-
versity advantage under the required SE. The results also show the flexibility provided by
the proposed technique through simply selecting the ST codeword and modulation type to
achieve a better performance.
Finally, we examine and compare the performance of the proposed ST codewords for a
fixed N . In this simulation, we also evaluate the BER performance using the mathematical
analysis through (4.27)-(4.30). In the first experiment, N = 6 transmit antennas and M = 3
receive antennas are used. As a result, according to Table 4.3, we have three possible antenna
configuration sets (i.e., ST codewords), and they are: SN1 = (3, 3) (Q = 2), SN2 = (2, 4)
(Q = 2) and SN3 = (2, 2, 2) (Q = 3) with the corresponding code rates being RN = 1, 1.5
and 3, respectively. We assume that the total SE is constrained to be η = 6 (bits/sec/Hz).
To meet the SE constraint, 64-QAM, 16-QAM and QPSK modulations are respectively used
for the above three antenna configuration sets. As observed in Figure 4.6(a), the curves
of mathematical analysis for all codeword cases are nearly the same as those of simulation
results. Figure 4.6(a) also shows that, SN2 = (2, 4) achieves the best BER performance
in medial-to-high SNRs. However, for lower SNR cases, SN = (2, 2, 2) may be the best
candidate. In the second experiment, N = 8 and M = 4 are assumed and the results
are plotted in Figure 4.6(b). In this scenario, we assume that η = 4 (bits/sec/Hz). From
Table 4.3 and under the total SE constraint, we thus adopt the following three antenna
configuration sets for comparison: SN1 = (4, 4) (Q = 2), SN2 = (2, 3, 3) (Q = 3) and SN3 =
129
to further alleviate the detection computational load, a recursive implementation of such a
group-wise OSIC detector by using the algebraic properties of orthogonal codes is also de-
veloped. Next, based on the proposed OSIC detection property, we can find all the possible
codewords of the grouped STBCs regardless of the number of transmit antennas. We then
study the code properties and design a simple selection criterion for choosing the optimal
ST codeword based on the minimum BER criterion when the total transmit power and data
throughput are constrained. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed ST encod-
ing technique can flexibly and judiciously select the ST codewords and modulation types
to achieve the better performance than the pure spatial multiplexing and transmit diversity
techniques, and the semi-antenna/antenna group-wise OSIC detection scheme can provide a
computationally efficient solution for such the systems.

Chapter 5
Conclusions
The use of multiple transmit antennas and multiple receive antennas in wireless commu-
nications has been considered in this report. Several ST processing techniques regarding the
ST signaling and interference suppression for MIMO wireless communications have also been
addressed and some new transmitter and receiver architectures have been proposed. The
proposed ST transceivers have been shown through mathematical analysis and computer
simulations to be (i) low-complexity implementation, (ii) smart and robust to the channel
variation, and (iii) better matched to the channel condition and system requirement over the
popular existing methods.
The introductory chapter included the background overview, literature review, motiva-
tions and contributions of this project related to the topics under consideration. In Chapter
2, we gave an overview of the MIMO wireless communications. The basic concepts including
the ST system model, channel capacity and two popular ST techniques, namely the STBC
and V-BLAST have been discussed.
In Chapter 3, a flexible MIMO transceiver has been proposed for the uplink in MU
dual-signaling systems over the Rayleigh flat-fading channels. In such a system, each mobile
terminal data stream can be either ST block encoded for transmit diversity or spatially multi-
plexed for achieving high data rate, across multiple antennas based on its channel condition.
139
optimal ST codeword over the conventional pure SM and TD techniques, and the OSIC
based detection method can provide a reasonable solution for such an system.

Matched-Filtered Channel Matrix:
Complex-Valued Constellation Case
We present the analogue results of Lemma 3.3.1 when the complex-valued symbols are
used. It is noted that, in this case, the available code rate depends on the number of transmit
antennas N [47]: full-rate code for N = 2 (hence K = P = 2), and half-rate code for N = 3
or 4 (K = 8, P = 4). The derivations of the MFCM for complex-valued constellation case
are to first identify in each case the ST modulation matrices; each signature matrix is then
computed to verify the result. Since the derivations are basically the same as those in the
real symbol case, we will not go them through but only present the results (see the following
Lemma). The results are also summarized in Table 4.3. Note that in Table 4.3, A(i,j) is the
(i, j)th block submatrix of A with proper matrix dimension.
Lemma B.0.1. Let Fp,q be the submatrix of F describing the mutual coupling between the
pth and the qth user. Then the following results hold.
(1) If p, q ∈ SD, for N = 2, then Fp,q ∈ O(4). In particular, we have Fq,q = αqI4 for some
scalar αq.
(2) If p, q ∈ SD, for N = 3 or 4, then Fp,q ∈ U(8), where U (1,1)(8) = U (2,2)(8) ∈ O(4) and
U (1,2)(8) = U (2,1)(8) = O4. In particular, we have Fq,q = αqI8 for some scalar αq.
147
Appendix C
Proof of Lemma 3.4.1
The proof is based on a crucial fact about the orthogonal designs [47]. Specifically, it
can be checked by analytic computations that, ifM1,M2 ∈ O(P ), then so areM1+M2 and
M1M2, that is,
Fact C.0.1. The set O(P ) is closed under addition and multiplication. Moreover, for any
M1 ∈ O(P ), it is easy to see that M1 +MT1 = γIP for some γ. ¥
Based on Fact C.0.1, the result can be shown by induction on L.
For the L = 1 case, the result is obvious since F = αIP . Assume that the result is true
for an arbitrary L > 1, that is, F ∈ F(L) implies F−1 ∈ F(L) for such an L. We have to
check that F−1 ∈ F(L+1) whenever F ∈ F(L+1). To see this, let us partition an arbitrary
F ∈ F(L+ 1) as
F =

, (C.1)
where A ∈ RPL×PL, B ∈ RPL×P , and D ∈ RP×P . We note that, since F ∈ F(L + 1), we
have (a) A ∈ F(L) and hence A−1 ∈ F(L) by assumption, (b) D = cIP for some scalar c,
149
Proof of (3): Since D¯ =
(
D−BTA−1B)−1 and D = cIP , it suffices to check that
BTA−1B = c1IP for some scalar c1. For k, l = 1, 2, . . . , L, denote by Ukl the (k, l)th P × P
block submatrix of A−1. Since B =
[
BT1 ,B
T

BTA−1B =

k,l=1
BTkUklBl =
L∑
k=1
BTkUkkBk +
L∑
k,l=1, k 6=l
BTkUklBl. (C.4)
SinceA−1 ∈ F(L), we have by definitionUkk = ηkIP for some scalar ηk. The first summation
on the right-hand-side of the second equality in (C.4) thus simplifies as
L∑
k=1
BTkUkkBk =
L∑
k=1
ηkB
T
kBk = ηIP . (C.5)
On the other hand, since for k, l = 1, 2, . . . , L, Bk ∈ O(P ) and Ukl ∈ O(P ) by assumption.
Then we have each BTkUklBl ∈ O(P ), and it follows that
BTkUklBl +B
T
l UlkBk = αklIP (C.6)
by Fact C.0.1. This shows that
L∑
k,l=1, k 6=l
BTkUklBl = η˜IP . (C.7)
Lemma 3.4.1 thus follows.

for such an L. We have to check that F−1 ∈ G(JL+1), where JL+1 := 12
∑L+1
l=1 Pl, whenever
F ∈ G(JL+1). Let us partition an arbitrary F ∈ G(JL+1) as (C.1), where A ∈ R4JL×4JL ,
B ∈ R4JL×2PL+1 , and D ∈ R2PL+1×2PL+1 . We note that, since F ∈ G(JL+1), we have (a)
A ∈ G(JL) and hence A−1 ∈ G(JL) by assumption, (b) if we write B =

where Bl ∈ R2Pl×2PL+1 , then according to Table 4.3 we have that Bl ∈ {O(4),V(4)} for
N = 2 or Bl ∈
{U(8),V(16),D(8, 16),DT (8, 16)} for N = 3 or 4, and (c) D = cI for some
scalar c. Also, let us similarly write F−1 as (C.2), where A¯ ∈ R4JL×4JL , B¯ ∈ R4JL×2PL+1 , and
D¯ ∈ R2PL+1×2PL+1 . To show that F−1 ∈ G(JL+1), it suffices to check that (1) A¯ ∈ G(JL), (2)

Bl ∈

Appendix F
Proof of Lemma 4.3.1
Part (p1) of Lemma 4.3.1 has been shown in Appendix C. It only needs to prove Parts
(p2)-(p3).
Proof of (p2): We first note from (2.72)-(2.76) that the effective signal component (priori
to matched filtering) of the qth antenna group is H¯qA¯q. Accordingly, the MFCM coupling
signature between the pth and the qth antenna groups is A¯Tp H¯
T

i, j = 1, 2, . . . , Lq, is directly computed as

, (F.1)
where hTq,m is the mth row of Hq. Equation (F.1) gives an important observation that the
(i, j)th element of Fp,q fully describing the structure of Fp,q is completely characterized by
Ap,i andAq,j or simply just the result ofAp,iA
H
q,j. As a result, to see the particular structures
of Fp,q, we need to first compute Ap,iA
H
q,j. For Np = Nq = 2, and according to [47], we thus
have
Ap,1 = Aq,1 =
 1 0 0 0

 , Ap,2 = Aq,2 =
 0 −1 0 0

is given in (F.2) and (F.4), respectively, then it can be shown, after some manipulations,
that
A¯p,q =

Ap,1 −Ap,2 Ap,3 −Ap,4
Ap,2 Ap,1 Ap,4 Ap,3
Ap,3 −Ap,4 −Ap,1 −Ap,2
Ap,4 −Ap,3 −Ap,2 Ap,1

. (F.7)
Observing from (F.7), with Ap,i regarded as a particular variable, then we can find that the
matrix A¯p,q belongs to a (super) orthogonal design. With above discussions, we can conclude
that the resultant structure of A¯p,q can completely and directly reflect on that of Fp,q. This
means that to see the structure of Fp,q we only to check the structure of A¯p,q.
For Nq = 3 case, Aq,j, j = 1, 2, . . . , Lq can be easily obtained as that shown in (F.4) by
deleting the last row of it. Also, it can be shown that A¯p,q has exactly the same structure as
that given by (F.7). Similarly, for i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4, we can also obtain f
(i,i)
q,q = αq and f
(i,j)
q,q = 0
whenever i 6= j. Based on the above results, case (a) of Part (p3) is thus proved.
For the case (b) of Part (p3), the results can be shown by first identifying the matrix
A¯p,q and by following the same procedures, in which
A¯p,q =

Ap,1 −Ap,2 −Ap,3 −Ap,4
Ap,2 Ap,1 Ap,4 −Ap,3
Ap,3 −Ap,4 Ap,1 Ap,2
Ap,4 Ap,3 −Ap,2 Ap,1

. (F.8)

Ap,k = Aq,l =
 j · eTd(k−8)/2e ⊗A3 if k is oddj · eTd(k−8)/2e ⊗A4 if k is even k = 9, 10, . . . , 16, (G.3)
where ei is the ith unit standard vector in R
4. Based on (G.3) and using the fact (G.2) and
the following properties
(A⊗B)H = AH ⊗BH , (A⊗B)(C⊗D) = (AC⊗BD), (G.4)
it can be checked with (F.1) that each 2×2 block diagonal matrix of F(s,t)p,q ∈ R8×8, s, t = 1, 2,
belongs to an orthogonal design and thus F
(s,t)
p,q ∈ O(8) with 2 inputs. Also, we can fine that
F
(1,1)
p,q = F
(2,2)
p,q and F
(1,2)
p,q = −F(2,1)p,q .
Proof of (p3): Similarly, to identify the structure of Fp,q, let’s first define the following
augmented matrices:
B1 := A1 ⊗A1, B2 := A3 ⊗A2, B3 := A2 ⊗A1, B4 := A4 ⊗A2, (G.5)
where Ai, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, are defined in (G.1). For Nq ∈ {3, 4}, Aq,l, can be obtained as the
direct augmentation of two Bi matrices, that is [47]
Aq,l =
[
jb(l−1)/4cBmod(l,4) (−j)b(l−1)/4cBmod(l,4)
]
, l = 1, 2, . . . , 8, (G.6)
where mod(x, y) denotes the remainder after y dividing x, and B0 := B4. Based on (G.3)
and (G.6), we first compute Ap,iA
H
q,j and substitute it into (F.1). Then gathering each piece
of f
(i,j)
p,q and putting them altogether to examine Fp,q, it can be shown that, after some
manipulations, Fp,q indeed has the desired properties.

where A¯ ∈ RJi×Ji , B¯ ∈ RJi×LdIi−1(Gi+1)/2e , and D¯ ∈ RLdIi−1(Gi+1)/2e×LdIi−1(Gi+1)/2e . To show
that F−1i−1 ∈ F˜Ji−1(Gi + 1), it suffices to check that (i) A¯ ∈ F˜Ji(Gi) (ii) if we write B¯ :=[
B¯T1 . . . B¯
T
Gi

, where B¯l ∈ RLdIi(l)/2e×LdIi−1(Gi+1)/2e , l = 1, . . . , Gi, then each 4 × 4 block off-
diagonal submatrix of B¯l belongs to O(4) or is a zero matrix O4 (iii) D¯ = dILdIi−1(Gi+1)/2e .
Properties (i)-(iii) can be shown based on the inversion formula for block matrices


. (H.3)
Proof of (i): From (H.3), we have A¯ =
(
A−BD−1BT )−1 = (A− 1
c
BBT
)−1
. Since
A ∈ F˜Ji(Gi, Di), to prove A¯ ∈ F˜Ji(Gi), it suffices to check the structure of BBT . In
particular, BBT can be expressed as given in (D.1), where BkB
T
l , k, l,= 1, 2, . . . , Gi, have
the following structures. a) If NdIi(l)/2e = NdIi−1(Gi+1)/2e = 2, then according to (p2) of
Lemma 4.4.1 Bl ∈ O(8, 2) or Bl = O8. Therefore, we have BlBTl = clI8 or BlBTl = O8.
b) If NdIi(l)/2e = 3 or 4, NdIi−1(Gi+1)/2e = 2, then according to (p3) of Lemma 4.4.1 each
4 × 4 submatrix of Bl ∈ R4×8 belongs to orthogonal design. It can be easily checked that
BlB
T
l = clI4. c) If NdIi(l)/2e = 2, NdIi−1(Gi+1)/2e = 3 or 4, then according to (p3) of Lemma
165
Since A−1 ∈ F˜Ji(Gi), we have by definition Uk,k = ηkILdIi−1(k)/2e for some scalar ηk. Using
Fact 4.4.1, the first summation on the right-hand-side of the second equality in (H.5) can
thus be simplified as
Gi∑
k=1
BTkUk,kBk =
Gi∑
k=1
ηkB
T
kBk
=
 αkILdIi−1(Gi+1)/2e if NdIi(k)/2e, NdIi−1(Gi+1)/2e = 2,akI4 if NdIi(k)/2e = 2, NdIi−1(Gi+1)/2e ∈ {3, 4}. (H.6)
On the other hand, since k, l = 1, 2, . . . , Gi, each 4×4 block submatrix of Uk,l or Bk belongs
to an orthogonal design or is a zero matrix by assumption, then we have that each 4×4 block
submatrix of BTkUk,lBl also belongs to an orthogonal design or is a zero matrix. Therefore,
by using Fact C.0.1 it follows that
BTkUk,lBl + B
T
l Ul,kBk
=
 µkILdIi−1(Gi+1)/2e if NdIi(k)/2e, NdIi−1(Gi+1)/2e = 2,δkI4 if NdIi(k)/2e = 2, NdIi−1(Gi+1)/2e ∈ {3, 4}. (H.7)
From (H.7), it can be verified that
L∑
k,l=1,k 6=l
BTkUk,lBl =
 βkILdIi−1(Gi+1)/2e if NdIi(k)/2e, NdIi−1(Gi+1)/2e = 2,bkI4 if NdIi(k)/2e = 2, NdIi−1(Gi+1)/2e ∈ {3, 4}. (H.8)
Theorem 4.4.1 thus asserts.
