本研究應用VAR熔煉技術配製不同成分之Fe-Mn-Si-Cr--IA (interstitial-site atom)形狀記憶
合金，包括Fe-Mn-Si-Cr-C與Fe-Mn-Si-Cr-N等，並探討合金顯微組織、形狀回復特性與相變態
溫度等。實驗結果顯示：在Fe-Mn-Si-Cr形狀記憶合金中添加間隙型元素C及N，因可強化沃斯
田體相，進而有效提昇其形狀記憶效應。C及N元素添加量約為0.05~0.2wt%時可呈現最佳記

Abstract 
The Fe-Mn-Si-Cr--IA (interstitial-site atom) shape memory alloys, including Fe-Mn-Si-Cr-C 
and Fe-Mn-Si-Cr-N were prepared by vacuum arc re-melting (VAR) technique. Their 
microstructure, shape memory effect and transformation temperature were investigated. 
Experimental results show that the shape memory effect of Fe-Mn-Si-Cr alloys can be effectively 
improved by slight addition of carbon and nitrogen elements, due to the strengthening of Austenite 
phase. The Fe-Mn-Si-Cr alloys with 0.05~0.2wt% addition of carbon and nitrogen will exhibit the 
best shape memory effect. The as hot-rolled Fe-Mn-Si-Cr--IA shape memory alloys have worse 
shape memory effect, lower than 60%, because of the existence of many residual dislocations. The 
heat treatment at 500~700℃ will reduce gradually the residual internal stress and occur the 
phenomenon of recrystallization. These features can increase their shape recovery to 90~92％. 
However, if the heat-treating temperature is higher than 800℃, the shape recovery will reduce 
significantly due to the grain growth, precipitation of grain-boundary phase and the existence of 
more ε martensite within the matrix.

一、緣由與目的 
形狀記憶合金以TiNi基記憶合金【1, 2】的使用最為廣泛，它具有較佳的形狀記憶能力、
耐蝕性及生物相容性等特性，但其價格昂貴使得應用上有所限制。與TiNi基合金相比，鐵基
形狀記憶合金具有強度高、易加工、價格低廉等優點【3】，故在工業上具有極大的應用潛力
與市場競爭力。 
鐵基形狀記憶合金的應用，最具潛力的是製成套筒元件—即管接頭，用於水電管路、輸
油管、瓦斯管線等之接合。鐵基記憶合金中，又以Fe-Mn-Si基合金最為重要。然而，相較於
TiNi記憶合金，Fe-Mn-Si基合金形狀記憶效應較差，造成合金在應用上的限制。因此，如何
提昇Fe-Mn-Si基合金之形狀記憶能力是相當重要的研究主題。

圖 1(a)及(b)分別顯示 Fe59Mn30Si6Cr5C0.15 合金於熱輥壓狀態之內耗及頻率對溫度之相關
曲線圖。由內耗曲線圖中發現，加熱與冷卻過程分別在-23℃及 219℃出現內耗峰，這些內耗
峰係因為麻田散體相變態所產生，故藉由內耗量測可以確定其相變態溫度。圖 1 中顯示
Fe59Mn30Si6Cr5C0.15 合金之 Ms 與 As 溫度約為 27℃與 163℃。值得一提的是，由於 Fe-Mn-Si-Cr
記憶合金之麻田散體相變態屬於非熱彈型(non-thermo-elastic martensitic transformation)，其相
變態時未伴隨晶格軟化(lattice softening)現象，故相變態內耗峰不會出現相對應之頻率極小
(minimum of frequency)，亦即相對應之剪模數極小，此結果與具有熱彈型麻田散體相變態
(thermo-elastic martensitic transformation)之 Ti-Ni 形狀記憶合金不同【 10, 11】。其他
Fe59Mn30Si6Cr5--C 與 Fe59Mn30Si6Cr5--N 合金之相變態溫度與程序皆與圖 1 相似，故省略之。

Abstract 
The relaxation phenomena arising from both the static-constrained stress and the 
cyclic variation of atmospheric temperature of Fe59Mn30Si6Cr5 shape memory alloy 
were studied. Experimental results show that the relaxation amount decreases with 
increasing initial compressive loading. The cyclic variation of atmospheric 
temperature has a smaller effect on the relaxation than the static-constrained stress 
does. The relaxation phenomenon is more obvious both in the earlier cycles and at 
higher cyclic heating temperatures. The static-constrained stress relaxation is ascribed 
to the combination and rearrangement of the stress-induced thin platelets of ε 
martensite. The contribution of cyclic heating on the stress relaxation originates from 
the formation of new-oriented ε martensite. The ε ↔ γ transformation, thermal stress 
and shape-recovery stress during the thermal cycling are considered to have 
significant influences on the formation of new-oriented ε martensite.

Results and discussion 
The microstructure at room temperature for Fe59Mn30Si6Cr5 alloy 
Figure 2(a-b) shows the XRD pattern and TEM observation at room temperature 
for the as-annealed Fe59Mn30Si6Cr5 alloy. The Ms and As temperatures for this alloy 
are around 50~60℃and 140~150℃ [23], respectively. Meanwhile, its Mf temperature 
is clarified to be below 0℃, although no definite point has been reported. Hence, the γ 
and ε phases coexist within the alloy at room temperature, as presented in the XRD 
patterns of Figure 2(a). The coexistence of γ and ε phases within the alloy can also be 
clearly observed in the TEM observation in Figure 2(b) for the Fe59Mn30Si6Cr5 
specimen. 
The phenomena of static-constrained and thermal-cycled stress relaxation 
Figure 3 shows the compressive load versus strain for the Fe59Mn30Si6Cr5 alloy. 
It is known that the recoverable strain of the polycrystalline Fe59Mn30Si6Cr5 alloy is 
about 2~4%. Hence, the constrained strains for the experiments of stress relaxation 
are set to be in the range of 2~4%, as indicated by a, b, and c in Figure 3. The 
compressive loads, engineering stresses and strains for these points are presented in 
Table 1. Meanwhile, the elastic and plastic deformations are found to occur 
simultaneously in the stress region of a-b-c. The plastic deformation can be introduced 
by both stress-induced martensitic transformation and dislocation movement. 
As mentioned in Section 1, the relaxation phenomena may arise from both the 
static-constrained stress relaxation (with long-time sustaining of constrained stress) 
and thermal-cycled stress relaxation (with constrained stress and cyclic variation of 
atmospheric temperature). Figure 4 (a-b) shows the static-constrained stress relaxation 
curve with an initial 3000kgf loading at room temperature, and the thermal-cycled 
stress relaxation curve with an initial 3000kgf loading and 6 times of cyclic heating to 
260 , respectively℃ , for the Fe59Mn30Si6Cr5 alloy. Figure 4(a) shows a typical curve of 
static-constrained stress relaxation, namely, the initial stress decreases rapidly and 
then gradually approaches to a relaxation limit. As shown in Figure 4(a), the limit of 
static-constrained stress relaxation is about 11.5% for the 3000kgf loading. In Figure 
4(b), the thermal-cycled stress relaxation can be divided into two stages. In the first 
stage, the stress relaxation is mainly contributed from the static-constrained relaxation, 
which is related to the initial loading. As one can see in Figure 4(a), the 
static-constrained stress relaxation will complete more than 90% within 30 minutes. 
Therefore, in stage 2, the stress relaxation is mainly contributed from the effect of 
cyclic variation of atmospheric temperature, although the relaxation value is small and 
is related to the cyclic heating temperature and cyclic number. In the real application 
of pipe coupling, both long-time sustaining of constrained stress and cyclic variation 
of atmospheric temperature must occur at the same time. Hence, the following part of 
this paper will mainly discuss the phenomena of thermal-cycled stress relaxation of 
the Fe59Mn30Si6Cr5 alloy, which involves simultaneously both contributions of 
static-constrained stress and cyclic variation of atmospheric temperature.

This feature is believed to be related to the reverse transformation of ε → γ during 
heating and the forward transformation of γ → ε during the following cooling process. 
Meanwhile, the thermal stress and shape-recovery stress under the fixed constrained 
strain during the heating process will also be expected to enhance the formation of 
new-oriented ε martensite. At a lower cyclic heating temperature of 170℃, only a 
small part of ε → γ transformation can occur during the heating process. Hence, no 
obvious new-oriented ε martensite can be observed after the cyclic heating, as shown 
in Figures 9(a) and 10(a). It is worthy to mention that the net relaxation amount per 
cycle decreases gradually with increasing cyclic number, as shown in Figure 6. This 
indicates that the formation rate of new-oriented ε martensite will decrease with 
increasing cyclic number. This feature is reasonable because the formation of 
new-oriented ε martensite will be more difficult in the later thermal cycles. 
Conclusions 
The stress relaxation of Fe59Mn30Si6Cr5 shape memory alloy was studied by 
using a compressive test. The important conclusions are as follows: 
1. At higher initial loading, less amount of elastic strain will be transferred to plastic 
strain by internal accommodation. Hence, the relaxation amount decreases with 
increasing initial loading. 
2. The cyclic variation of atmospheric temperature has a smaller effect on the 
relaxation than the static-constrained stress does. There occurs a higher amount of 
relaxation at a higher cyclic heating temperature. Meanwhile, the relaxation 
phenomenon is more obvious in the earlier cycles and then gradually approaches 
to a saturated value. 
3. The static-constrained stress relaxation is ascribed to the combination of 
stress-induced thin platelets of ε martensite. Meanwhile, the platelets of ε 
martensite will also rearrange to accommodate the constrained loading, and hence 
the constrained stress is reduced. 
4. The effect of cyclic heating on the stress relaxation originates from the formation 
of new-oriented ε martensite. The ε ↔ γ transformation, thermal stress and 
shape-recovery stress during the thermal cycling are considered to have significant 
influences on the formation of new-oriented ε martensite.
