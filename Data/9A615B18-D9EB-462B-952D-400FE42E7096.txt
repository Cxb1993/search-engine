Abstract—This project addresses the state feedback L2-gain controllers design problem for discrete-time 
switched nonlinear control systems under arbitrary switching. We consider both cases of switching signal 
being measurable (utilizable) and un-measurable (not utilizable). In terms of discrete-time common control 
storage functions, sufficient conditions for the existence of globally uniformly L2-gain controllers are derived 
in both cases. Several criteria are proposed for verifying common control storage functions. Moreover, the 
conditions that the globally uniformly L2-gain feedback laws must satisfy are derived. For single input case, 
an explicit formula for constructing L2-gain controllers is presented.

II. Problem Formulation And Preliminaries 
In this section the problem to be solved is formulated and some preliminaries are proposed. 
A. Problem Formulation 
Consider a discrete-time switched nonlinear control system with m subsystems: 
  
 
x(k +1) = fσ(k )(x(k)) + g1σ (k )(x(k))w(k) + g2σ (k )u(k)      (1) 
    
 
z(k) = h1σ (k )(x) + k11σ(k )(x(k))w(k) + k12σ(k )u(k)  
where
 
x ∈Rn  is the state, 
 
w∈Rs  is the exogenous input, and 
 
u∈Rq  is the control input, 
  
 
σ :{0,1,2,...,∞} {1,...,m}  is the switching signal. Suppose that 
 
σ(k)  is arbitrary switching. For all 
 
i∈{1,...,m} , 
 
fi(x)∈Rn , 
 
g1i(x)∈Rn×s , 
 
g2i(x)∈Rn×q , 
 
h1i(x)∈Rr , 
 
k11i(x)∈Rr×s , and 
 
k12i(x)∈Rr×q  are 
locally Lipchitz. Without loss of generality, assume that 
 
fi(0) = 0  and 
 
h1i(0) = 0, i=1,…,m.  
Suppose that system (1) satisfies the following standard assumption.  
Assumption 1: 
 
k11i(x) = 0  ∀x ∈Rn , i=1,2,…,m.             ■ 
The Assumption 1 can be relaxed since it is made only for simplification. Notice that we do not make the 
assumption that 
 
k12i(x)  has full column rank for all 
 
x ∈Rn . 
The objective of this project is to design a feedback controller:  
 
 
u(k) = p(x(k)) , (in the case that 
 
σ(k)  is unknown)           (2) 
or 
 
 
u(k) = pσ (k )(x(k)) , (in the case that 
 
σ(k)  is known)           (3) 
such that, under arbitrary switching, the closed-loop system  
    
 
x(k +1) = fσ(k )(x(k)) + g2σ (k )(x(k))p(x(k)) + g1σ (k )(x(k))w(k)     (4) 
       
 
z(k) = h1σ (k )(x(k)) + k12σ (k )(x(k))p(x(k)), (
 
σ(k)  is unknown) 
or 
    
 
x(k +1) = fσ(k )(x(k)) + g2σ (k )(x(k))pσ (k )(x(k)) + g1σ(k )(x(k))w(k)     (5) 
       
 
z(k) = h1σ (k )(x(k)) + k12σ (k )(x(k))pσ(k )(x(k)) , (
 
σ(k)  is known) 
is internally stable (i.e., asymptotically stable under 
 
w(⋅) = 0) and has 
 
l2 -gain from w to z being less than 
 
γ . 
The later is equivalent to, under 
 
x(0) = 0, for all positive integer N and all 
 
w(⋅)∈ l2[0,N],

■ 
Since 
 
P  is positive definite, it is clear that 
 
ci(x) = 0 if and only if 
 
g2i(x) = 0  and 
 
k12i(x) = 0 . In this 
case, 
 
bi(x) = 0 . However, 
 
bi(x) = 0  does not imply 
 
ci(x) = 0 . Moreover, it can be shown that 
 
bi(x)y = 0 
for any 
 
y ∈ Ker(ci(x)). Now we propose some results about the verification of 
 
γ −DCCSF . We first 
consider the regular case (i.e., 
 
ci(x) is nonsingular for all 
 
x). 
Lemma 2: Consider the switched control system (1). Assume that  is nonsingular for all 
 
x ∈Rn . A 
function  with 
 
P > 0  is a 
 
γ −DCCSF  of all the subsystems in (1) if and only if 
 
bi(x)ci−1(x)biT (x) − 4ai(x) > 0, 
 
∀x ≠ 0 , 
 
∀i =1,2,...,m.     (14)

Now we consider the singular case. Suppose that  may be singular at some 
 
x ∈ Rn . For all 
 
i =1,2,...,m , since  is symmetric, there exists an orthogonal matrix  such that  
     
 
ci(x) = SiT (x) ˆ c i(x)Si(x)        (15) 
where

∀x ∈Rn ,

Next we will derive a criterion, independent of w, for verifying the CSCP.

x < δ , then there is 
some u with 
 
u < ε  such that 
        
 
ai(x) + bi(x)u + uTci(x)u < 0 .        (26)

III. Globally Uniformly 
 
L2 − gain Controllers 
This section presents the main results: sufficient conditions for the existence of GUL2G state feedback 
laws for system (1), and explicit formulas for constructing GUL2G controllers. 
A. The switching signal is known 
In this subsection, we consider the case that the switching signal 
 
σ(k)  is known and can be utilized in 
designing feedback laws. In the sequel derivations, let V(x) be a 
 
γ −DCCSF  of all the subsystems in (1).  
For regular case, define  
 
ϕ i(x) = −
1
2 ci
−1(x)biT (x)
        
(27) 
We have the following result. 
Theorem 1: Consider the switched control system (1). Assume that 
 
ci(x) is nonsingular for all 
 
x ∈Rn . 
There exists a switched state feedback law 
 
u(k) = pσ (k )(x(k)) internally stabilizes the switched control 
system (1), under arbitrary switching, and satisfies the 
 
L2 − gain requirement (6) if there exists a quadratic 
functions 
 
V (x) = xTPx  with 
 
P > 0  satisfying the CSCP, such that 
 
bi(x)ci−1(x)biT (x) − 4ai(x) > 0 , 
 
∀i =1,2,...,m .     (28) 
In this case, (3) with 
  
 
pi(x) =ϕ i(x)          (29) 
is a GUL2G feedback law for the system (1).            ■ 
For singular case, explicit formulas for constructing GUL2G controllers are difficult to derive. Define 
 9 
under arbitrary switching, and satisfies the 
 
L2 − gain requirement (6) if there exists a quadratic functions 
 
V (x) = xTPx  with 
 
P > 0 satisfying the CSCP, such that 
   
 
bi(x)ci−1(x)biT (x) − 4ai(x) > 0, 
 
∀i =1,2,...,m,      (35) 
and in addition,  
   
 
U(x) ≡ Ui(x)
i=1
q
 ≠ φ , 
 
∀x ≠ 0 .       (36) 
In this case, (3) with any 
 
p(x)  satisfying 
 
p(x)∈U(x) , 
 
∀x ≠ 0         (37) 
is a GUL2G controller for the system (1).             ■ 
IV. Results for Single-Input Singular case 
For single-input switched control systems in singular case, we can get some additional results.  
Lemma 5: Consider the switched control system (1). A function 
 
V (x) = xTPx  with 
 
P > 0  is a 
 
γ −DCCSF  of all the subsystems in (1) if and only if, for all 
 
i =1,2,...,m , 
 C1’). for each 
 
x ≠ 0  such that 
 
bi(x) = 0 , then 
 
ai(x) < 0 . 
 C2’). for each 
 
x ≠ 0  such that 
 
bi(x) ≠ 0 , then 
 
bi2(x) − 4ai(x)ci(x) > 0.                    ■ 
Define 
 
D1i ≡ {x ∈Rn ci(x) = 0}  and 
 
D2i ≡ {x ∈Rn ci(x) ≠ 0} , i=1,…,m, and let 
 
N(η) = x ∈Rn x ≤η{ }.  
Lemma 6: A 
 
γ −DCCSF  
 
V (x) = xTPx  of all the subsystems in (1) satisfies the CSCP if, for all 
 
i =1,2,...,m , one of the following conditions holds: 
L1). 
 
0∉cl(D2i) ; 
L2). 
 
0∈cl(D2i)  and 
 
lim
η→ 0
sup
x∈N (η )∩D2 i
ai(x)
ci(x)
≤ 0. 
However, the verification of L2) may be difficult. The next lemma proposes a simpler condition for 
verifying the SCP. 
Lemma 7: A 
 
γ −DCCSF  
 
V (x) = xTPx  of all the subsystems in (1) satisfies the CSCP if there exist 
continuous functions 
 
α i(x)∈ R  and 
 
βi(x)∈ R , i=1,2,…,m, where 
 
α i(x) ≤ 0  in a neighborhood of the 
origin and 
 
βi(0) = 0 , such that 
            
 
ai(x) =α i(x) + ci(x) ⋅ β i(x), i=1,2,…,m.      (38) 
 11 
controllers for the subsystems in (1) with 
 
q =1. In additional, an explicit formula for constructing GUL2G 
controllers is provided. 
Theorem 4: Consider the switched control system (1) with 
 
q =1. There exists a state feedback law 
 
u(k) = p(x(k)) internally stabilizes the switched control system (1), under arbitrary switching, and satisfies 
 
L2 − gain requirement (6) if there exists a quadratic functions 
 
V (x) = xTPx  with 
 
P > 0  satisfying the 
CSCP, such that

V. Conclusions 
In this project, a constructive approach is proposed for designing globally uniformly L2-gain state 
feedback laws for discrete-time switched nonlinear control systems under arbitrary switching. Based on the 
DCCSF method, sufficient conditions for the existence of L2-gain controllers was derived. Moreover, explicit 
formulas for constructing globally uniformly L2-gain feedback laws under different assumptions were 
proposed.
