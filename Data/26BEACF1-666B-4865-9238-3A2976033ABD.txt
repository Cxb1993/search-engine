material.  The use of block or graft copolymers as 
“macro-surfactant” compatibilisers is rather general.  
Nanocomposite materials from different matrix 
materials such as polyethylene (24,25) and 
polypropylene (26,27) have been prepared successfully. 
In this work, we present for the first time a study on 
the effects of the nature of commercially available 
compatibilizers on the nanocomposites that are formed 
with PMMA via the melt mixing route, and compare 
and contrast the structure and physical properties to 
those from the typically modified organoclay 
melt-based intercalation approach.  The motivation 
for such a study stems from the lack of sufficient 
understanding and the interest in the use of new routes 
for PMMA organoclay hybrids.  Though PMMA 
interestingly shows interactions with montmorillonite, 
extensive studies can pave the way for a more 
comprehensive understanding of the modification of 
clay surface in the exfoliated polymer systems.  The 
results presented here include wide-angle X-ray 
diffraction (WAXD) patterns of the hybrid structures, 
direct observation of the nanoscale structure via 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the 
mechanical and the thermal properties with dynamical 
mechanical analysis (DMA), thermal mechanical 
analysis (TMA), and the onset of thermal degradation 
and weight loss curves of these hybrids. 
 
三、Experimental    
A. Materials and Sample Preparation 
The virgin PMMA was an injection grade resin 
purchased from ChiMei Co., Taiwan, with product 
number CM211.  Its number-average molecular 
weight (Mn) was 32000 with a polydispersity (PD) of 
2.19.  The organically modified montmorillonite, 
Cloisite 30B, was purchased from Southern Clay 
Product Inc., Gonzales, TX, and was used as received.  
The organoclay was prepared by modification of 
natural montmorillonite clays with quaternary 
ammonium salt.  According to the data provided by 
the supplier, the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the 
organoclay was 90meq/100g clay, and the organic 
surfactant methyl tallow bis-2-hydroxyethyl 
ammonium (MT2EtOH).   
Three types of styrene-maleic anhydride block 
copolymer (SMA), trade name SMA 458, SMA 456, 
and SMA 049 with different chemical structures and 
molecular weights from Scientific Polymer Product, 
US were used here.  The physical properties of the 
base polymer and the compatibilizers are summarized 
in Table 1.  To all the compounds, 0.2 wt% heat 
stabilizer (EVERNOX-76) from Everspring Chemical 
Co., Taiwan, was added to prevent degradation of the 
polymer during compounding.           
PMMA, SMA copolymers and organoclay used for 
nanocomposite preparation were dried at 80 oC in an 
air circulatory oven for a period of 24 h prior to 
processing.  SMA and required amount of clay were 
dry mixed and then fed into the molten PMMA, and 
melt blended at a temperature of 180 oC in a Brabender 
plasticorder mixer (capacity 50 cm3) at 100 rpm for 
mixing time of 15 min, during which the imposed 
torque and temperature would reach an equilibrium 
value.  PMMA nanocomposites have been prepared 
from melt blending using processing temperature 
175-200 oC as seen in literature (18).  Processing 
temperature was chosen to avoid any significant 
thermal degradation of organic modifier, especially 
seen at higher temperatures from previous work and as 
known in literature.  We  determined that mixing 
speed of 100 rpm and mixing time period of 15 min 
gives maximum change in d001-spacing with no change 
in level of intercalation with increasing mixing time for 
PMMA.  Note that the clay content was 5 wt% for 
each nanocomposite.  The SMA content was 15 wt% 
for SMA modified systems.  The label and the 
composition of each sample are listed in Table 2. 
B.  Characterization Methods 
 2
the peak intensity reduction, TEM observations were 
conducted. 
The TEM photos in Figs. 2 and 3 reveal the 
structures for PN0 and PN458, respectively. The dark 
and bright regions correspond to the clay and PMMA 
matrix, respectively. The low magnification image 
clearly shows the existence of clay clusters in NP0, 
indicating a poor clay dispersion (Fig. 2a).  It is 
interesting to observe that at high magnification (Fig. 
2b) the cluster shows a loose and disordered structure.  
However, these clusters possess a well aligned densely 
compacted structure.  This reconfirms the XRD 
results for the poor clay intercalation and dispersion of 
this sample.  No sign of partial exfoliation can be 
observed, and so the sharp diffraction peak of the PN0 
is more likely due to the intercalated clay stacks.  
Figure 3 shows the TEM micrograph for PN458.  
Multilayer stacks with partially exfoliated structure 
were observed (Fig. 3a), indicating better and more 
uniform dispersion for PN458 with very few clay 
clusters.  On focusing on the aggregate and 
amplifying, it is very interesting to observe a very loose 
layer structure (Fig. 3b), which is quite different from 
the well-ordered layer structure of the stack in PN0 
(Fig. 2b).  It is expected that this loose structure can 
be readily converted to an exfoliate structure, under 
intensive processing conditions or the use of a higher 
amount of copolymer.  The destruction of the ordered 
structure of the clay in PN458 should be the result of a 
good interaction between the clay surface and the SMA 
copolymer.  Reviewing the XRD patterns for the 
PNCs, the decrease in peak intensity with the addition 
of SMA copolymers could be attributed to the loose 
(disordered) structure of the clay layers in the stacks.  
Overall, the PNCs with copolymers exhibit a better 
nanodispersion, which comprises intercalation and 
exfoliation, while only an intercalated structure can be 
observed for the PN0 system. 
B. Thermal Analysis 
The thermal properties of PMMA nanocomposites 
are investigated in the coefficients of thermal 
expansion (α), decomposition temperature (Td).  All 
materials show temperature dependence in their αs, 
especially above Tg (glass transition temperature). 
Therefore, a single reported number for a cannot 
accurately reflect the expansion behavior, except below 
Tg, where a changes little.  Nonetheless, it is 
customary to select a representative value of α for 
comparison purposes (28).  The linear α of the 
material is the slope of the relative dimension change 
vs temperature curve.  The dimension change vs 
temperature curves of the PMMA nanocomposites are 
shown in Figure 4.  All nanocomposites show similar 
behaviors in αs.  Below Tg is low and relatively flat, 
whereas above Tg is high and steeply increasing.  
Eventually the strength of nanocomposites breaks 
down at far beyond Tg.  Below Tg of the amorphous 
phase, we expect that the expansion behavior of the 
glassy amorphous chains and the crystal chains can be 
very similar.  On the other hand, above Tg, amorphous 
chains have large-scale segmental motions.  Table 3 
shows αs at different temperatures of the PMMA 
nanocomposites studied.  As a result, the αs of the 
PMMA nanocomposites are increased in order of  
PN049 > CM211 > PN0 > PN456 > PN458.  The 
results indicate that copolymer modification can be 
attributed to the reducing of the αs on the PMMA 
nanocomposites.  PN458 has lowest α among the 
nanocomposites, due to the improvements of dispersion 
properties, resulting from the increase of styrene 
content (see Table 1).  
The TGA analysis of the PMMA nanocomposites 
studied are shown in Figure 5, respectively.  As 
results, the final residual weight of PMMA 
nanocomposites studied can be very similar, and TGA 
thermograms reveal that PMMA nanocomposites begin 
 4
temperatures with nanoclay reinforcement.  
Furthermore, PN458 showed the greatest increase due 
to significant confinement effect.  
D. Dielectric Properties  
As shown in Figure 8, the dielectric permittivities, 
ε’, determined from temperature sweep teats of neat 
PMMA and the nanocomposites showed similar 
relaxation behaviors as seen from DMTA tests.  In 
general, ε’ increases as the temperature increases.  
The glass (α) transition is above 100 oC shown as a 
step change.  The subglass (β) transition is broadened 
in the range between 20 to 80 oC.  The magnitudes of 
ε’ for nanocomposites are higher than that of neat 
PMMA due to the free charge carriers from the 
heterogeneous inclusions of nanoclay.  In addition, 
PN0 (without SMA addition) showed the highest ε’ 
among the nanocomposites, because SMA copolymers 
may interact with the charge carriers and interfered 
with their responses to the applied electrical field.    
Figure 7 shows the spectra of the dielectric loss, ε” for 
all samples.  Again both the α and the β transitions 
are clearly seen from the ε” curves.  However, the 
high temperature α peaks were masked by the space 
charge polarization in all hybrid systems.  Moreover, 
the magnitudes of e” for nanocomposites are also 
higher than that of neat resin.  It is well known that 
the polarization contribution from the dipole 
orientation is dominated in the neat PMMA.  The 
increase of both e’ and e” at high temperatures of 
PMMA nanocomposites might be understood by that 
the exfoliated and intercalated clay within the polymer 
matrix has contributed the free charge carriers, such as 
free surfactant or impurities, which result in space 
charge polarization or interfacial polarization.  
五、Conclusion 
PMMA/SMA/organoclay PNCs, with various SMA 
copolymers, were prepared to investigate the effect of 
copolymer type on the dispersion and mechanical 
performance.  The melt blended PCN materials were 
characterized by WAXD and TEM.  As evidenced by 
XRD, the organoclay was well intercalated in the 
PMMA matrix.  The TEM studies clearly showed that 
the MMT clay was intercalated and randomly dispersed 
in the PCN-blending materials.  Compared to the pure 
PMMA, the PCN materials with 5 wt % clay loading 
exhibited higher thermal degradation temperatures up 
to 400 °C and glass-transition temperatures up to 110 
°C.  The improvement of the thermal properties could 
be attributed to the fact that the confined polymer 
chains in the gallery of MMT were not free from chain 
motion.  A significant increase of the dielectric 
constant and loss was observed for the PCN-blending 
materials because the dispersive clay largely 
contributed to the space charge polarization, together 
with the polarization of dipole orientation of PMMA 
matrix, leading to great increase in both ε’ and ε” at the 
high temperatures beyond Tg.

Abstract 
 
In this work we report on the investigation of the 
dynamics of maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene 
(PPgMA) and PPgMA-based nanocomposites by 
means of dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS) and 
dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA).  We 
study the effects of different PPgMAs on the 
miscibility with the organoclay, and examine the effect 
of organically modified silicate filler on the dynamics 
of PPgMA.  Our results suggest that the α-relaxation 
process, corresponding to the glass transition of 
PPgMA, is significantly affected by the clay loading.  
The increase in Tg is a direct result of polymer-filler 
interactions that reduce the polymer chain mobility.  
Furthermore, in the nanocomposite materials a 
separate high-temperature process due to 
Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars (MWS) polarization was 
observed with dielectric relaxation spectroscopy.   
 
Introduction 
 
The incorporation of polymers by semectite clays 
has been known for several decades (1,2).  Many 
research efforts have focused on the commercial 
exploitation of polypropylene due to its attractive 
combination of properties and low cost.  However, it 
has been a scientific challenge to disperse silicate clays 
in the highly apolar polyolefins because of the absence 
of any strong interactions.  Even if the alkylammon- 
ium-based organically modified clay has surfactants 
with the same aliphatic nature as PP, there would be 
neither attractive nor repulsive enthalpic interaction 
between surfactant and polymer (3).  Therefore, 
additional modifications have to be considered for 
improving the compatibility of PP with organically 
modified clays. 
 
The general approach for modifying PP has been 
the addition of polar functional groups or hydrophilic 
block to the polypropylene backbone.  Unfortunately, 
the availability of such end-functionalized PP or block 
copolymer of PP is very limited due to synthetic 
chemical difficulties, most of such approaches are 
employing the commercially available maleic 
anhydride grafted polypropylene (PPgMA) polymers 
(4-7).  Such functionalized PP would be affine with 
the clay and also compatible with the bulk PP matrix.  
Though both exfoliated and intercalated structures had 
been observed in the maleated PP/organoclay 
composites (8-10), many exfoliated nanocomposites, 
when viewed at various magnifications, suggest that 
the apparent exfoliation that occurs during blending 
actually results in loose tactoids (aggregates of sheets).  
Until a clear understanding of the molecular 
(interaction) parameters most likely to promote 
complete exfoliation is in hand, achieving the optimum 
properties with inorganic nanofillers will be difficult. 
 
Molecular parameters of maleated polypropylene 
that influence their effectiveness to form PPgMA/clay 
nanocomposites are: (i) molecular weight associated 
with shear viscosity and polymer diffusivity; (ii) MA 
content relating to the amount of functionality present 
in the compatibilizer; and (iii) the distribution of MA 
moiety along the polymer backbone.  High MA 
content generally enhances the melt intercalation of 
PPgMA into clay layers.  However, the effect of 
molecular weight is less clear.  Most authors used low 
molecular weight PPgMAs to enhance the diffusion of 
polymers into clay galleries (4-6), but high molecular 
weight PPgMAs allow better improvement in 
mechanical properties (7,9-10). 
 
Thus, the challenge with polypropylene is to design 
systems where the polymer/clay interactions are more 
favorable than the surfactant/clay interactions.  In 
addition, the maleation of polypropylene creates more 
favorable polymer-clay interactions leading to 
exfoliation of the clay layers and creation of new 
interfaces, which are responsible for the alteration of 
polymer matrix properties.  To obtain better design 
criteria for polymer-layered silicate systems, we must 
understand how the constitutent interactions, that is, 
the interactions between the maleated polypropylene 
and the silicate layers, affect the ability of the 
polypropylene matrix to open and infuse the galleries.  
The aim of this work is, thus, to investigate the 
relaxation behaviors of the hybrid system consisting of 
PPgMA/organoclay nanocomposites.  Particular 
attention has been paid to the effect of interfacial 
interaction on the degree of clay dispersion through 
varying the loading and MA content of maleated 
polypropylenes. 
  
Experimental 
 
extensively intercalated structure due to strong 
interfacial interactions between the polymer and the 
clay platelets, the reduced mobility of polymer chains 
confined between or bonded to the clay surfaces, and 
the inherent high modulus of the clays.  When the 
temperature passing through the glass transition zone, 
the chain motion in the matrix phase becomes 
dominant, the neat PB3200 and the nanocomposites 
show a similar profile of E’.  
  
The dielectric measurements on the neat PB3200 
and its nanocomposites extending over a temperature 
range from –80 to 130oC at a constant frequency of 
100 Hz are shown in Figure 4.  The neat resin seems 
to show no dielectrically active relaxation process 
regardless of their polar maleic anhydride groups, 
which may be due to the sensitivity limitation of the 
parallel plate sensor unable to detect the weak response 
of the α-relaxation in the neat resin.  On the other 
hand, in the nanocomposites significant electrode 
polarization effects are seen in ε’ (Figure 4a) at 
temperature above 10oC.  Since the electrical charges 
are easily built up at the interfaces between 
intercalated clay tactoids, at 40oC a separate high 
temperature process due to Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars 
(MWS) interfacial polarization was observed in the 
loss tangent curve (Figue 4b) for the nanocomposites 
(12,13).  As expected, the intensities of ε’ is higher 
with increasing clay loading due to more ionic species 
present at the interfacial region, and the relaxation 
peak of tanδ also becomes sharper as the clay loading 
increases.   
 
The X-ray film diffraction patterns for nano- 
composites of PB3000 with different compositions are 
displayed in Figure 5.  The dashed line shows the 
peak position of the organoclay 15A, corresponding to 
a gallery height of 3.15 nm.  Similar to the PB3200 
nanocomposites, the clay characteristic peak height is 
generally lower with low loadings.  As the clay 
loading decreases the diffraction peak is also shifted to 
a lower angle, indicating an intercalated structure of 
15A by E43.  We then plotted the d100 basal spacing 
against clay loading in Figure 6 for all hybrids of 
different PPgMAs.  It can be clearly seen that a 
critical clay loading exists for each maleated 
polypropylene.  Around 20 to 30 wt.% of clay, the 
clay gallery expansion increases sharply, and the 
confined polymer chain conformation is expected to 
transform from a single layer conformation at high 
clay loadings to a multi-layer conformation at low 
loadings.  In addition, the nanocomposites of the low 
molecular weight E43 shows the greatest gallery 
expansion.  The intercalating power of E43 stems 
partly from the high diffusivity due to its low 
molecular weight, and partly from the strong affinity 
due to its high maleic anhydride content.     
 
The dynamic mechanical properties of the PPgMA 
nanocomposites were measured in the temperature 
range -90–130oC at a constant frequency of 1 Hz.  
Note that the Tgs of Polybond series, PB3150, PB3200 
and PB3000, were all about 0oC determined from the 
peak maximum in the tanδ curves; however, the Tg of 
E43 rises to 50oC possibly due to the hydrogen 
bonding among maleic anhydride groups.  The 
temperature dependence of the storage modulus, E’, 
and the loss tangent, tanδ of the PPgMA/15A 
nanocomposites with clay loading at 5 wt.% are shown 
in Figures 7a and 7b, respectively.  It is obviously 
that the Tgs of the nanocomposites are shifted to 
higher temperatures.  In particular, the Tg of E43/15A 
hybrid shows the greatest increase, which may be 
associated with strong interaction between E43 and 
15A due to the high MA content of E43.  
 
The dielectric measurements on the PPgMA 
nanocomposites with 20 wt.% clay loading extending 
over a temperature range from –80 to 130oC at a 
constant frequency of 100 Hz are shown in Figure 8.  
As mentioned earlier, significant electrode polarization 
effects are also seen in ε’ (Figure 8a).  Since the dc 
conductivity (ionic impurities) of the nanocomposites 
dominates the dielectric loss ε” at high temperatures, 
which obscures the relaxation due to interfacial  
polarization, only the loss tangent (tanδ) is presented 
here as a function of temperature (Figure 8b).  As 
expected, the loss tangent peak, corresponding to 
MWS interfacial interaction, occurs at higher 
temperature than Tg, and the magnitudes of both ε’ 
and tanδ are higher for E43/15A hybrid due to high 
MA content, enhancing the interfacial interaction 
between E43 and 15A clay. 
 
Conclusion 
 
We have studied the dynamics of PPgMA and 
PPgMA nanocomposites with DRS and DMTA. Single 
relaxation process has been observed by DMTA, i.e., 
the segmental α relaxation.  Our findings show that 
the nanostructured filler affects the dynamicsof the α 
relaxation of PPgMA, which is shifted toward higher 
temperatures.  Regarding the DR measurements a 
distinct high temperature process was observed for the 
nanocomposite samples, which can be considered to be 
due to Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars (MWS) polarization.  
Our results suggest the dynamics of PPgMA are 
significantly affected by the nanostructured filler at 
temperatures above Tg and strongly dependent on clay 
loading.  Corresponding relaxation rates allow a 
rough estimate of characteristic length scales in the 
nanocomposites and therefore also depend on the 
degree of dispersion of the filler particles (silicate 
layers).  This correlation may provide a possible route
