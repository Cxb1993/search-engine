Abstract 
Er3+-doped Y2Ti2O7 thin films with the thickness of ~375 nm thin films were fabricated 
by the sol-gel spin-coating method. A pyrochlore phase ErxY2-xTi2O7 was observed with a 
strong (222) preferred orientation while the annealing temperature exceeded 800 °C. Below 
800 °C annealing, thin films exhibited amorphous structure. The average visible transmittance 
calculated in the wavelength range 200–1100 nm of the Er3+-doped Y2Ti2O7 thin films 
annealed at 400 to 900 °C reduced from ~87 to ~77% because of the increase of grain size 
and surface roughness. The variation of refractive indexes and optical band gaps of 
Er3+-doped Y2Ti2O7 thin films strongly depend on the Er3+ concentrations and annealing 
temperatures. Higher annealing temperatures result in the increase of refractive indexes but 
the decease of optical band gaps. In addition, higher Er3+ concentrations lead to a decrease in 
both refractive indexes and optical band gaps. The variation of these basic optical properties 
can be attributed to the evolution of grain size, crystallinity, lattice constant, and composition 
of Er3+-doped Y2Ti2O7 thin films. Because the competition between the [OH-], concentration 
quenching effect, as well as the diversity and symmetry of Er3+ lattice sites, the Er3+ 
(5%)-doped Y2Ti2O7 thin films annealed at 700 °C for 1 h possessed the largest intensity of 
~1.5μm PL and FWHM ~ 60 nm.

get the high-quality optical thin films. We demonstrate for the first time that ErxY2-xTi2O7 (x=0~2) 
thin films have high average transmittance (>77%), high refractive index (>1.93 atλ=550 nm) and 
high optical band gap (>4.06 eV), which strongly depends on the variation of Er3+ concentration 
(0~100%) and annealing temperatures (400~900 °C). These good optical properties make 
ErxY2-xTi2O7-based films have potential applications in the micro-integrated photonic device and 
luminescent solar converter. The effects of Er3+ dopant on phase development, film morphology, 
and related optical properties of Er3+-doped Y2Ti2O7 thin films will be systematically 
investigated.  
 
3. 研究方法與步驟  
Acetic acid (HAc, CH3COOH, 99.5%, Merck) and 2-methoxyethanol (2-MOE, 
HOC2H4OCH3, 99.5%, Merck) with molar ratio of Ti/HAc/2-MOE=1/10/15 were first added to 
titanium isoproxide {Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4, ≧98%, Acros}. The yttrium acetate [Y(CH3COO)3．4H2O, 
99.9%, Alfa] solution [a mixture of methanol (CH3OH, ≧99.5%, Merck) and ethylene glycol 
(HOCH2CH(OH)CH2OH, ≧99.5%, Alfa)] and erbium acetate (Er(CH3COO)3．4H2O , 99.9%, 
Alfa) were dissolved into the titanium solution, followed by stirring for 10 h in order to process 
homogeneous hydrolysis and polymerization reaction. Subsequently, the Er3+-doped Y2Ti2O7 
precursor solution was spin-coated on fused silica substrates. The as-deposited sol-gel films were 
first dried at 100 °C/10 min, pyrolyzed under dry air atmospheres at 400 °C for 30 min at a 
heating rate of 3 °C /min and further annealed at temperatures ranging from 700-900 °C for 1 h in 
dry air atmosphere. Multiple spin-coating processes were employed to deposit ~375 nm thick 
films.  
     The crystal structure was determined by an X-ray diffractometer (Shimadzu, XRD 6000). 
Scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi, S4800-I) was used for microstructural examination. The 
thickness of thin films was measured by the α-step profile meter (KLA-Tencor, Alpha-Step IQ). 
Transmission spectra in the UV and visible ranges were determined on a Shimadzu UV-2100 
spectrophotometer. The fluorescence spectra were excited by a 980 nm diode laser (JDSU, 
27-8052-300, maximum power 300 mW) with power of 250 mW inclined 45o to irradiate the 
sample films and recorded normally from the films using a spectrophotometer (Horiba 
Jobin-yvon, iHR 550) equipped with a InGaAs photodiode detector (Electro-Optical Systems Inc., 
IGA-050-TE2-H) at room temperature.

A. Crystal structure and film morphology 
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns in figure 1 show the effect of annealing temperatures 
on phase evolution of Y2Ti2O7 thin films. Obviously, below 700 °C, a weak broad continuum 
around 2θ=~22o in the XRD patterns is the characteristic of amorphous structure. While the 
annealing temperature exceeded 800 °C, a pyrochlore phase Y2Ti2O7 was observed with a strong 
preferred (222) peak [13]. On the other hand, other samples [Er3+ (5%)-doped Y2Ti2O7, Er3+

Figure 2 The XRD patterns of Er3+ (0, 5, or 10%)-doped Y2Ti2O7, and Er2Ti2O7 thin films 
annealed at 800 °C for 1 h. 
 
Figures 3(a)~(h) illustrate the top-view SEM imagines of Er3+ (0, 5, or 10%)-doped Y2Ti2O7, 
and Er2Ti2O7 thin films annealed at 800 and 900 °C for 1 h. When samples were annealed below 
800 °C, no crystal image can be detected because the crystal size of amorphous thin films were 
too small, which were beyond the detective resolution of SEM. As annealing temperature raised 
to 800 oC, the Er3+ (0, 5, or 10%)-doped Y2Ti2O7, and Er2Ti2O7 thin films had an average grain 
size of approximately 40 nm [Figs. 3(a)-(d)]. However, the average grain size rapidly increased to 
~70 nm at 900 oC annealing [Figs. 3 (e)-(h)]. With increasing annealing temperature, some small 
voids were present and enlarged. The microstructure of the films oxidized at 800 oC is relatively 
homogeneous in comparison to films oxidized at 900 oC [where some larger grains (~150 nm) 
can be seen]. This finding suggests that these films annealed at 900 oC are essentially 
inhomogeneous and, therefore, a higher surface roughness can be expected. The SEM images 
disclose again that the evolution of crystal size between Er3+ (0, 5, or 10%)-doped Y2Ti2O7, and 
Er2Ti2O7 thin films annealed at different temperatures are almost the same as detected by the 
FWHM of XRD peak. 
    Based on above-mentioned results of XRD peak intensities and crystal sizes, Er3+ (0, 5, or 
10%)-doped Y2Ti2O7, and Er2Ti2O7 thin films obviously appeared to be very similar properties on 
the phase evolution, crystal growth, and film morphology, which may be attributed to Y3+ and 
Er3+ ions have the same valance electrons and similar ionic radii, as well as Y2Ti2O7 and Er2Ti2O7 
have the same crystal structural and similar lattice constant.

Figure 5 The optical transmittance spectra of Er3+ (0, 5, or 10%)-doped Y2Ti2O7, and Er2Ti2O7 
thin films annealed at 800 °C for 1 h. 
 
    The refractive index (n) of the Er3+ (0, 5, or 10%)-doped Y2Ti2O7, and Er2Ti2O7 thin films 
were derived from the transmittance spectra using Swanepoel’s method [19]. Figure 6 shows that 
the wavelength dependence of refractive indexes for ErxY2-xTi2O7 thin films annealed at 800 °C 
for 1 h. Er3+ concentration has a strong influence on the refractive index (n) and higher Er3+ 
concentration can decrease the refractive index of a composite film. For example, the refractive 
indexes are 2.20, 2.16, 2.14, and 2.09 atλ=550 nm (or 2.20, 2.16, 2.14, and 2.09 atλ=563 nm) 
for pure Y2Ti2O7, Er3+ (5%)-doped Y2Ti2O7, Er3+ (10%)-doped Y2Ti2O7, and  Er2Ti2O7 thin films 
annealed at 800 oC for 1 h, respectively. Figure 7 shows the Er3+ concentration dependence of 
refractive indexes (n at 550 nm) for ErxY2-xTi2O7 thin films annealed at 400-900 °C for 1 h. 
    The refractive index of bulk Y2Ti2O7 is 2.34 (at λ=563 nm) [20]. However, as far as we 
know, there is no reported literature for the refractive index of bulk Er2Ti2O7. M. Langlet et al. 
5, or 10%)-doped Y2Ti2O7, and Er2Ti2O7 thin films annealed at 400-900 °C for 1 h. 
 
    After calculation, the packing densities of the Y2Ti2O7 thin films fabricated at 400 to 900 °C 
for 1 h increased from 0.84 to 0.99. The packing density increased with the increase of annealing 
temperature and refractive index, which could be attributed to the significant reduction in the 
porosity and increase in the crystallinity [supporting SEM photographs, Fig. 3(e), and XRD 
pattern, Fig. 1]. Based on the investigation in the first section, the evolution of crystal structures 
and film morphologies between the Er3+ (0, 5, or 10%)-doped Y2Ti2O7, and Er2Ti2O7 thin films 
annealed at different temperatures were almost the same. Therefore, the packing densities of the 
Er2Ti2O7 thin film fabricated at 900 °C for 1 h could be postulated to be the value of Y2Ti2O7 thin 
film fabricated at 900 °C for 1 h, i.e. 0.99. According to equation (2), the refractive index of bulk 
Er2Ti2O7 could be inferred to be 2.31, which is still lower than that of bulk Y2Ti2O7 and anatase 
TiO2. 
    The refractive indexes of ErxY2-xTi2O7 thin films were enlarged by increasing annealing 
temperatures, and this phenomenon can be attributed to the higher densification and crystallinity 
of thin films annealed at higher temperatures. It is well known that the refractive index of 
amorphous phase is lower than well-crystalline phase (e.g., the refractive index of amorphous 
TiO2 is about 2.0-2.1). On the other hand, the variation of refractive indexes of ErxY2-xTi2O7 thin 
films with different Er3+ concentration could be elucidated as follows. The refractive index of 
heterogeneous mixture is primarily related to the refractive index and volume fraction of 
individual phase [24-26].  
    In our system, ErxY2-xTi2O7 thin films can be considered as the mixture of Y2Ti2O7 and 
Er2Ti2O7 phase. Since the above-inferred refractive index of bulk Er2Ti2O7 is about 2.31 which is 
smaller than that  of bulk Y2Ti2O7 (n=2.34), the refractive indexes of Er3+-doped Y2Ti2O7 thin 
films should be reduced with increasing Er3+ concentration. Therefore, a smaller and adjustable n 
values can be obtained for Er3+-doped Y2Ti2O7 thin films. Table I lists the experimental and 
calculated refractive indexes of ErxY2-xTi2O7 thin films with different annealing temperatures and 
Er3+ concentrations. The Drude model was used as the calculated values of the refractive indexes 
of ErxY2-xTi2O7 thin films, and the equation can be presented below [27]:

Figure 8 (αhν)2 as a function of photon energy (E) of the Y2Ti2O7 thin film fabricated at 
400-900 °C/1 h. 
 
    Figure 9 plots the relationship of (αhν)2 versus photon energy (E) of the Er3+ (0, 5, or 
10%)-doped Y2Ti2O7 and Er2Ti2O7 thin films fabricated at 800 °C/1 h and the extrapolated optical 
band gaps of the films were determined. When the Er3+ concentrations increased, the values of Eg 
decreased from 4.10 to 4.07 eV. Although no reported literatures investigated the variation of 
optical band gaps of Y2Ti2O7 thin films with different Er3+-doped concentrations, we think that 
the evolution of optical band gaps of ErxY2-xTi2O7 system could be similar to that of the 
AlxGa1-xAs system (direct band gap). The Ga3+ and In3+ are in the same group IIIa, have the same 
valance electrons but Ga3+ has larger ionic radius than Al3+ (Ga3+=0.47 nm and Al3+=0.39 nm), 
which results in the AlAs and GaAs have the same crystal structure, but AlAs has larger lattice 
constant than GaAs (GaAs=5.653 nm and AlAs=5.662 nm). According to the Kronig–Penney 
model, when electrons move in a crystal lattice with periodic crystal potential, electrons occupy 
certain allowed energy band and are excluded from the forbidden energy bands. The energy (E) 
of a nearly-free electron is expressed as [31]   
 
 2 1/ 2 1/ 2(2 / ) 2 /        ( =1, 2, 3.....)                                             (6)em E k n a nπ= +h

me, k and a are electron mass, wave number, and the width of potential barriers, respectively. 
Obviously, the energy is related to a, and a is related to lattice constant. In the AlxGa1-xAs system, 
the evolution of energy gap significantly depends on the evolution of lattice constant. The more 
Ga3+ concentration can result in the smaller lattice constant and smaller energy gap [32-34].  In 
our ErxY2-xTi2O7 system, Y3+ and Er3+ are in the same group IIIb, have the same valance electrons 
but Y3+ has larger ionic radius than Er3+ (Y3+ = 0.0892 nm and Er3+ = 0.0881 nm), which results in 
the Y2Ti2O7 and Er2Ti2O7 have the same crystal structure, but Y2Ti2O7 has larger lattice constant 
than Er2Ti2O7 (Y2Ti2O7=10.09 nm and Er2Ti2O7=10.07 nm). Therefore, based on the AlxGa1-xAs 
system, we can infer that more Er3+ concentration can reduce the lattice constant of ErxY2-xTi2O7 
thin film, which results in the decrease of optical band gaps. 
°C/1 h were always lower than that of Er3+ (5%)-doped Y2Ti2O7 thin films. In addition, compared 
to Er3+ (5 or 10%)-doped Y2Ti2O7 thin films, the PL intensities of the Er2Ti2O7 thin films were 
found to be extremely low even by the excitation of 300 mW. Although Er2Ti2O7 thin films had 
the shortest Er-Er interatomic distance (0.356 nm) and experienced the maximum concentration 
quenching effect, they still exhibited very weak ~1.5μm photoluminescence. Above-mentioned 
PL properties of Er3+-doped Y2Ti2O7 thin films with different annealing temperatures and Er3+ 
concentrations are consistent with the results of reported literatures [21,37,38]. Moreover, 
although the thin films should have visible up-conversion luminescence, no visible light can be 
detected in our measurement system, which can be attributed to that the intensity of 
up-conversion luminescence was too weak to be detected due to the limitation of our existing 
spectrophotometer measurement set-up. Therefore, this paper only focuses on the 
above-mentioned investigations on the phase development, film morphology, basic optical 
characterizations (n, T%, and Eg), and ~1.5μm PL properties of Er3+-doped Y2Ti2O7 thin films. 
However, the more detailed visible fluorescent measurements will be executed by more delicate 
equipments in the near future.

Abstract 
Eu3+-Y3+codoped tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) powders were fabricated by sol-gel method. 
The doping concentration of Sn4+ ions was fixed at 10 mol%, and  Eu3+ and Y3+ ions varied 
from 0.05-0.3 and 0.5-4 mol%, respectively. According to the powder X-ray diffraction and 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses, samples annealed at 600 °C for 1 h were composed 
of the mixture of amorphous pyrochlore phase Eu3+-doped Y2Sn2O7 and crystallized bixbyte 
phase Eu3+-Y3+-Sn4+ codoped In2O3. The resulting Eu3+-Y3+codoped ITO powders exhibit 
stronger red 611 nm emission (5D0→7F2 transition) by adding more Y3+ ions. The 5D0→7F2 
transitions corresponding to the f–f transitions of the Eu3+ ions and Eu-O charge transfer occur at 
the strong absorption of 466 and 237 nm, respectively. However, the conductivity is deteriorated 
by more addition of Eu3+ and Y3+ ions because of the formation of more insulating amorphous 
Eu3+-doped Y2Sn2O7.

1-mm-thickness, and they were further annealed at 600 oC for 1 h. 
The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was measured by a Shimadzu XRD 6000 
diffractometer, and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Hitachi, S4800-I) was used to 
examine the microstructure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using Mg 
kα radiation for elemental analysis (Kratos, AXIS Ultra DLD). A monochrometer (Horiba 
Jobin-yvon, MicroHr) equipped with a 300 W Xe lamp (Hamamatasu, L2479) was used as the 
excitation light source inclined 45° to irradiate the pellet samples and room temperature 
photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded normally from samples using a spectrophotometer 
(Horiba Jobin-yvon, iHR 550) equipped with a photomultiplier tube detector (Hamamatasu, 
7732P-01). Sheet resistance was measured by a digital multimeter (Fluke, 8845A) using the 
four-point probe method at room temperature. To calculate the resistivity, correction factors were 
used to adjust for the diameter and thickness of the disc-shaped pellets [11].  
 
4. 結果與討論   
Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of Eu3+ (0, 0.1 and 0.3 mol%)-Y3+ (0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 
mol%) codoped ITO powders annealed at 600 °C for 1 h. All of the samples possess 
well-crystallized bixbyite phase, as indicated by characteristic XRD peaks at (222), (400), (440), 
and (622) (JCPDS, Card No. 06-0416).  Adding 0.1-0.3 mol% Eu3+ and 0.5-4 mol% Y3+ ions do 
not obviously influence the diffraction intensity of the (222) peaks in all samples. This implies 
that the slight addition of Eu3+ and Y3+ ions with a total concentration of up to 4.3 mol% into ITO 
host does not significantly degrade the crystallinity of ITO powders. On the other hand, all XRD 
patterns indicate the formation of only a single bixbyite-structured phase without any possible 
other phases such as SnO2, In4Sn3O12, Eu2Sn2O7, and Y2Sn2O7.  
Some reported studies revealed that when annealing temperature was higher than 800 °C, 
Y2O3 and Eu2O3 reacted with SnO2 to form a well-defined Y2Sn2O7 and Eu2Sn2O7 pyrochlore 
phase in a Y3+-doped ITO system and Eu3+-doped SnO2 system, respectively; however, Y2Sn2O7 
and Eu2Sn2O7 appeared in the amorphous state at ≦700 °C annealing [6,9,10].  Based on XRD 
results and reported literatures, we deduce that in our system some Eu3+ and Y3+ ions can react 
with Sn4+ ions to form the amorphous pyrochlore phase, and other unreacted and remaining Eu3+ 
and Y3+ ions can replace the position of In3+ ions in a Sn4+-doped In2O3 lattice because of the 
same charge and similar ionic radii between In3+, Y3+, and Eu3+ ions. Therefore, the Eu3+-Y3+ 
codoped ITO powders annealed at 600 °C for 1 h are composed of a mixture of amorphous 
pyrochlore phase Eu3+-doped Y2Sn2O7 (i.e., EuwY2-wSn2O7) and crystallized bixbyite phase 
Eu3+-Y3+-Sn4+ codoped In2O3 (i.e., EuxYySnzIn2-x-y-zO3), which can be further identified by XPS 
and PL measurements in the following sections.  
 
Fig. 2: SEM photographs of the pure ITO powders annealed at 600 °C for 1 h (a and b), and Eu3+ 
(0.3 mol%)-Y3+ (4 mol%) codoped ITO powders annealed at 600 °C for 1 h (c and d)  . 
 
Figure 3 shows XPS spectra for Eu3+ (0.1 mol%)-Y3+ (0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mol%) codoped 
ITO powders annealed at 600 °C for 1 h in four regions: Y 3d, In 3d, Sn 3d, and O 1s. Eu 3d 
cannot be detected due to a very low Eu3+ doping concentration. The Y 3d5/2 and Y 3d3/2 
photoelectrons peaks located at binding energies of 157.9-157.4 and 159.7-159.2 eV, respectively, 
are assigned to the Y3+, which reveals the formation of Y-O bonding [13]. Adding more Y3+ ions 
gradually moves peak positions closer to those of Y2Sn2O7 (157.0 and 158.8 eV) [10], implying 
the formation of more Y2Sn2O7. The spin-orbit splittings of In 3d level are located at binding 
energies of 444.3 (In 3d5/2) and 451.8 eV (In 3d3/2), and Sn 3d level are located at binding 
energies of 486.5 (Sn 3d5/2) and 494.9 eV (Sn 3d3/2). These results clearly demonstrate the 
presence of In-O and Sn-O bonding, indicating the formation of an ITO structure [14]. On the 
other hand, the binding energy of O 1s level appearing at approximately 530.1-529.9 eV is close 
to that of Y2O3 (529.5 eV), Y2Sn2O7 (529.7 eV), and SnO2 (530.5 eV). [15,10,16] The shoulders 
at approximately 532 eV are ascribed to hydroxyl groups (OH-) that are likely acquired when the 
powders were exposed to ambient water [16]. However, the binding energy of O 1s gradually 
blue shifts as Y3+ doping concentration increases. The more content of Y3+ ions can strongly 
influence the chemical environment of O2- ions, which could be related to the formation of more 
amorphous phase EuwY2-wSn2O7.

Variation of the 611 nm PL intensity of Eu3+-Y3+ codoped ITO samples with the different

Figure 5 shows the excitation spectra corresponding to the 5D0→7F2 transition of Eu3+ ion in 
Eu3+ (0 and 0.1 mol%)-Y3+ (0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mol%) codoped ITO powders annealed at 600 °C 
for 1 h. A sharp and strong band at 467 nm can be assigned to the f–f transitions (7F0→5D2) of the 
Eu3+ ion. [23,24]. On the other hand, the excitation spectra including another strong broad peak at 
237 nm were observed in the Eu3+ (0.1 mol%)-Y3+ (1, 2, and 4 mol%) codoped ITO samples. The 
charge-transfer transition between Eu3+ and O2- generally occurs at 250~260 nm. L.R. Singh et. al. 
reported that as the covalency of Eu-O bonds in Y2O3 nanocrystals increases, the Eu-O charge 
transfer energy can blue shift in comparison with that of bulk Y2O3 [24]. In the proposed system, 
therefore, the amorphous pyrochlore phase Eu3+-doped Y2Sn2O7 consists of short-range order and 
nanosized structure, which could result in the Eu-O charge transfer energy blue shifting to 237 
nm. Obviously, the intensity of Eu-O charge-transfer band is enlarged with the increase of Y3+ 
contents. In other word, the extent of electronic transition from the 2p orbital of O2- to the 4f 
orbital of Eu3+ in Eu3+ (0.1 mol%)-Y3+ (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mol%) codoped ITO powders should be 
different from that of Eu3+ (0.1 mol%)-doped ITO powders. It is well known that the Eu-O charge 
transfer band can be influenced by the coordination environment around Eu3+ ions and the 
covalency of Eu-O bonds [25]. The coordination number of Eu3+ ions in EuwY2-wSn2O7 and 
EuxYySnzIn2-x-y-zO3 is 8 and 6, respectively. The coordination number of Eu3+ ions and Eu-O bond 
length in amorphous EuwY2-wSn2O7 are different from that in crystallized EuxYySnzIn2-x-y-zO3, 
resulting in the Eu3+ ions possessing different chemical environments in these two materials. 
Because Eu3+ (0.1 mol%)-doped ITO sample is composed of a mixture of amorphous Eu2Sn2O7 
and crystallized EuxSnzIn2-x-zO3, and Eu3+ (0.1 mol%)-Y3+ (1 mol%) codoped ITO sample is

6. 結論 
This study fabricated Eu3+-Y3+codoped ITO powders with precisely controlled stoichiometry 
of dopants using the sol-gel method. The Eu3+-Y3+ codoped ITO powders annealed at 600 °C for 
1 h are composed of a mixture of amorphous Eu3+-doped Y2Sn2O7 and crystallized Eu3+-Y3+-Sn4+ 
codoped In2O3, which yields a photoluminescence of 611 nm red light (5D0→7F2). A higher Y3+ 
concentration increases the PL intensity because the formation of more Eu3+-doped Y2Sn2O7 
phase reduces the concentration quenching effect. The excitation spectrum corresponding to the 
5D0→7F2 transition shows strong absorption at 467 and 237 nm. These absorbed peaks can be 
attributed to the f–f transitions of the Eu3+ ions and Eu-O charge transfer, respectively. In addition, 
the Eu3+ and Y3+ codoping concentrations should be controlled within ~0.5 mol% to avoid 
deterioration in conductivity. There exists an obvious tradeoff between luminescence and 
conductivity for Eu3+-Y3+ codoped ITO powders.

Er3+-doped Y2Ti2O7 thin films with the thickness of ~375 nm thin 
films were fabricated by the sol-gel spin-coating method. A pyrochlore 
phase ErxY2-xTi2O7 was observed with a strong (222) preferred 
orientation while the annealing temperature exceeded 800 °C. Below 
800 °C annealing, thin films exhibited amorphous structure. The 
average visible transmittance calculated in the wavelength range
200–1100 nm of the Er3+-doped Y2Ti2O7 thin films annealed at 400 to 
900 °C reduced from ~87 to ~77% because of the increase of grain size 
and surface roughness. The variation of refractive indexes and optical 
band gaps of Er3+-doped Y2Ti2O7 thin films strongly depend on the 
Er3+ concentrations and annealing temperatures. Higher annealing 
temperatures result in the increase of refractive indexes but the decease 
of optical band gaps. In addition, higher Er3+ concentrations lead to a 
decrease in both refractive indexes and optical band gaps. The variation 
of these basic optical properties can be attributed to the evolution of 
grain size, crystallinity, lattice constant, and composition of Er3+-doped 
Y2Ti2O7 thin films. Because the competition between the [OH-], 
concentration quenching effect, as well as the diversity and symmetry 
of Er3+ lattice sites, the Er3+ (5%)-doped Y2Ti2O7 thin films annealed at 
700 °C for 1 h possessed the largest intensity of ~1.5μm PL and 
FWHM ~ 60 nm.

Abstract 
Rare earth ions (Eu3+) and Y3+ ions were codoped into the tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) transparent 
conductive electrode to make it possess visible luminescent properties. The Eu3+-Y3+codoped 
transparent conductive thin films with the precise control on the desired stoichiometry of dopants were 
fabricated by sol-gel spin-coating technologies. We first report that the Eu3+-Y3+codoped ITO thin 
films show better visible luminescent properties than Eu3+-doped ITO thin films. The higher Y3+ 
concentration can increase the 611 nm PL intensity of Eu3+-Y3+ codoped ITO thin films. However, the 
Eu3+ and Y3+ codoping concentrations should be controlled within 0.1% and 0.5%, respectively, to 
avoid the deterioration of conductivity. We believe that the Eu3+-Y3+codoped ITO thin films can play 
dual roles as the luminescent solar concentrators and transparent conductive electrode to enhance the 
efficiency of solar cells. 
Keywords:  ITO, Europium, Yttrium, Pyrocholre, Photoluminescence 
1 Introduction 
The luminescent solar concentrators (LSC) have attracted lots of attention for the efficiency 
enhancement of solar cell these past years [1-3]. Most of the LSC is the organic or inorganic 
fluorescent materials which were coated on the surface of solar cell devices [4-6]. However, this kind 
of LSC will increase the manufacturing procedures and cost. There is only 5% ultraviolet (UV) and 
near blue light (300~400 nm) that can reach the Earth surface [7] and most of the solar cells do not 
have good operating efficiency in this section because of the absorption of transparent conductive 
electrode [8,9]. Therefore we hope that the luminescent solar concentrators can convert this UV light to 
500~700 nm visible light, which can be further absorbed by solar cell. 
In this study, we try to codope Eu3+ and Y3+ ions into the transparent conductive electrode, 
tin-doped indium oxide (ITO), to make them possess visible luminescent properties. These Eu3+-Y3+ 
four-point probe method (Fluke, 8845A). 
3 Results and discussions 
3.1 Crystal structures and film morphologies 
Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of ITO film and Eu3+ (0.1 mol%)-Y3+ (0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mol%) 
codoped ITO thin films annealed at 600 °C for 1 h. All of the samples possessed the well-crystallized 
bixbyite phase identified by the characteristic XRD peaks: (222), (400), (440), and (622) [10]. 
Compared to the diffraction intensity of (222) peak between all samples, the addition of 0.5 mol% Eu3+ 
and 0.5-4 mol% Y3+ ions did not obviously influence the peak intensity of Eu3+-Y3+ codoped ITO thin 
films, which implies that the slight addition of Eu3+ and Y3+ ions with a total concentration of up to 4.1 
mol% into the ITO host did not significantly degrade the crystallinity of ITO thin films. The average 
crystal size was determined by the Scherrer’s equation depending on the full width at half maximum 
(FWHM) of XRD peak [11]. For ITO film and Eu3+ (0.1 mol%)-Y3+ (1 mol%) codoped ITO thin films 
annealed at 600 °C for 1 h, the FWHM of (222) peak increased from 0.336° to 0.466° and the average 
crystal sizes decreased from ~22 to ~19 nm.  
On the other hand, all XRD patterns indicate the formation of single bixbyite-structured phase for 
Eu3+-Y3+ codoped ITO thin films without any possible other phases such as Y2O3, Eu2O3, SnO2, 
In4Sn3O12, and Y2Sn2O7. ITO is a kind of solid solution which Sn4+ concentration of up to 10 mol% can 
dissolve in In2O3 lattice, resulting in the maximum conductivity [12]. Moreover, In2O3, Y2O3, and 
Eu2O3 possessed the same structures, i.e., bixbyite phase and similar lattice constants (a), as 
summarized in Table I. Although Eu3+ and Y3+ 
ions in In2O3 lattice to form the solid solution i.e., YxIn2-xO3 and EuxIn2-xO3. On 
the other hand, Eu2O3 and Y2O3 can react with SnO2 to form the cubic pyrochlore phase, Y2Sn2O7 and 
Eu2Sn2O7. A. Ambrosini et. al. investigated that by doping Y3+ ions into In2O3 lattice, the lattice 
constant can be enlarged because  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
when the film thickness was up to ~900 nm, the fluorescence intensity was stronger enough to be 
detected by monochrometer excitation. The ~900 nm thick film appeared to have some cracks, which 
can not be used for the measurement of sheet resistance but can be used for the measurement of 
excitation spectrum. Therefore, the fluorescent measurement of all samples with thickness of ~300 nm 
was executed by using a 325 nm He-Cd laser with an output power of 4 mW as the excitation light 
source.  
Figure 2 shows the emission fluorescence spectra of (a) Eu3+ (0.1 mol%)-Y3+ (0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 
mol%) and (b) Eu3+ (0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mol%)-Y3+ (1 mol%) codoped ITO thin films annealed at 600 
°C for 1 h. Obviously, the Eu3+ ions show only one characteristic visible emission, 611 nm red light, 
which is attributed to the 5D0→7F2 transition of Eu3+ ions. Interestingly, no 5D0→7F1 transition (~590 
nm) of Eu3+ ions can be detected for all samples. It is well 
known that the probability of intra-4f-f transitions strongly depends on the site

the f–f transitions of the Eu3+ ions [17]. Within this broad band, a sharp and strong band at 465 nm can 
be assigned to the 7F0→5D2 transition. Additionally, because the band gap energy of In2O3 nanocrystal 
is ~4 eV (~300 nm) which is larger than the bulk In2O3 (3.7 eV; ~335 nm), a very small excitation band 
at 300 nm could be attributed to the energy-transfer transition between Eu3+and In2-zSnzO3-δ [18]. The 
existence of the excitation band corresponding to the band gap energy is the evidence of energy transfer 
from the In2-zSnzO3-δ nanocrystal to the Eu3+ ions but the very small In2-zSnzO3-δ host band in the 
excitation spectrum of Eu3+ indicates that there is a little energy transfer from the In2-zSnzO3-δ host to 
the doped Eu3+ ions. 
On the other hand, the spectrum consists of two very strong broad peaks centered at 207 and 236 
nm. It is well known that the charge-transfer transition between Eu3+ and O2- generally occur at 
250~260 nm. L.R. Singh reported that because the covalency of Eu-O bonds in Y2O3 nanocrystals 
increases, the Eu-O charge transfer energy can be blue shifted in comparison with that of bulk Y2O3 
[19]. In our system, the average crystal size of Eu3+-Y3+ codoped ITO thin films annealed at 600 °C for 
1 h was ~20 nm, which could result in the Eu-O charge transfer energy blue shifting to 236 nm. 
Moreover, band gap energy of bulk Y2Sn2O7 is 4.45 eV (~279 eV) but because of quantum confinement 
effect, the band gap energy of nanosized Y2Sn2O7 should be more than 1~2 eV of that value [20]. 
Therefore, the 207 nm excitation band could be related to the energy-transfer transition between Eu3+ 
and Y2Sn2O7 because the EuxYySn2-x-yO7 is amorphous phase with nanosized crystals. 
The above-mentioned results reveal that Eu3+-Y3+ codoped ITO thin films annealed at 600 °C for 1 
h  with bixbyite structure can transfer the UV~blue light (200-470 nm) to visible light (611 nm). We 
believe that Eu3+-Y3+ codoped ITO thin films should have good application in the single crystal or poly 
crystal Si-based solar cells which have less quantum efficiency in the wavelength range from 300 to 
500 nm. 
3.3 Electrical properties 
The sheet resistance of Eu3+-Y3+ codoped ITO thin films annealed at 600 °C for 1 h as a function of 
different Eu3+-Y3+ doping concentrations is illustrated in Fig. 5. The resistivity of ITO thin films 
increased up to ~5 % by light Y3+ or Eu3+ doping concentration (0.5 mol%). However, higher doping 
concentrations can significantly deteriorate the conductivity. For example, for only 1% Y3+ doping 
concentration the resistivity of ITO thin film was approximately doubled. The addition of Eu3+ and Y3+ 
ions into ITO lattice can induce the formation of amorphous pyrochlore phase EuxYySn2-x-yO7, an 
insulator with the energy gap of 4.46 eV, which results in the increase of resistivity. [20] Furthermore, 
because Y3+ and Eu3+ ions can react with Sn4+ ions to form the pyrochlore phase EuxYySn2-x-yO7, the 
Sn4+ content in In2-zSnzO3-δ should be reduced, which also results in the decrease of the carriers created 
by the dopant and the increase of resistivity.
