1. Introduction 
 
The hydrolysis of soy protein can give rise to particularly interesting bioactive functions, such 
as immunostimulative activity (Chen et al., 1995), anti-oxidative activity (Moure et al., 2006), 
angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitory activity (Chiang et al., 2006), cholesterol-lowering 
activity (Tsou et al., 2009) and adipogenesis inhibitory activity (Tsou et al., 2010). Several reports 
have also indicated that fractionating dietary protein hydrolysates with optimum MWCO 
ultrafiltration membrane could further enhance their bioactivity (Chiang et al., 2008). In addition, a 
soy protein and its hydrolysate have been reported to reduce body fat of dietary obese rats and 
genetically obese mice (Aoyama et al., 2000). However, the effects of controlling soy protein 
degradation in terms of the degree of hydrolysis (DH) on lipolysis-stimulating activity have not yet 
been reported. DH is a useful way of monitoring the extent of protein degradation and is defined as 
the percentage of total peptide bonds in a protein that has been cleaved during hydrolysis 
(Adler-Nissen, 1982). 
 
2. Objective 
 
The objective of the study was to investigate whether the limited enzymatic hydrolysis of soy 
protein isolate and the subsequent fractionation using ultrafiltration will enhance the lipolysis- 
stimulating activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. A possible pathway for protein hydrolysate to reveal the 
activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was also investigated. 
 
3. Literature Review 
 
Obesity has increased dramatically in the past 25 years and is considered to be a serious 
problem that is associated with the development of major human metabolic diseases, including 
non-insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension, cancer, gallbladder disease, and atherosclerosis 
(Gregoire et al., 1998). Adipose tissue is basically an energy reservoir in mammals that takes in 
glucose and free fatty acid (FFA) postprandial and stores them as triglyceride by lipogenesis. 
During fasting, the adipose tissue releases glycerol and FFA by lipolysis of the stored triglycerides 
into the circulating blood (Wang et al., 2008). Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) predominantly 
performs the initial step in triglyceride hydrolysis resulting in diglyceride and FFA. 
Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) hydrolyses triglyceride, diglyceride, and monoglyceride at a ratio 
of 1:10:1 (Haemmerle et al., 2002). Monoglyceride lipase (MGL) hydrolyses monoglyceride into 
glycerol and FFA. 
In adipocytes, lipolysis is stimulated by catecholamines through elevating cAMP and by 
activating cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) (Londos et al., 1999). PKA phosphorylates 
hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and causes translocation of HSL from cytosol to lipid droplets in 
adipocyte (Clifford et al., 2000). Activated HSL leads to the initiation of triglyceride hydrolysis. 
Other signaling pathways also activate HSL. One of these pathways involves protein kinase C and 
can be stimulated by mitogen-activited protein kinases (MAPKs) (Greenberg et al., 2001). 
Natriuretic peptide increases the cGMP level and activates protein kinase G which induces 
phosphorylation and activates HSL (Sengenès et al., 2003). The mobilization of glycerol and FFA 
from adipose tissue as a result of lipolysis supplies other tissue with metabolites and a energy 
substrate.

4.6. TR measurement 
 
Triglyceride residue in cells were measured by a colorimetric method using a triglyceride assay 
kit (Randox, Laboratories). Cellular protein content was analyzed using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) 
protein assay kit (Pierce, IL, USA). 
 
4.7. Western blot analysis 
 
The 3T3-L1 adipocytes were washed twice with a phosphate-buffered saline solution and then 
solubilized with a lysis buffer (5 M NaCl，1 M pH 8.0 Tris，0.5 M EDTA，20 % SDS，NP-40，
6.03 mM C24H39NaO4). All the cell lysates were centrifuged (13,000×g, 10min, 4℃) and subjected 
to immunoblot analysis with primary antibodies to HSL, phospho-HSL, ATGL and beta-actin 
(Cell-signaling, Boston, USA). Immune complexes were detected with secondary antibody and 
enhanced chemiluminescence. 
 
4.8. Immunostaining of HSL 
 
The cells were fixed for 20 min with 4 % paraformaldehyde and 0.01 % Triton X-100 in PBS 
at room temperature followed by 3 rinses with PBS. After formaldehyde fixation, the cells were 
completely covered with ice-cold methanol in a freezer. Nonspecific binding sites in the cells were 
blocked with 5 % normal serum for 60 min and washed 3 times with PBS. The cells were 
incubated with rabbit polyclonal serum against HSL overnight at 4 ℃ and subsequently with 
FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen, OR, USA) for 1 h in the dark at room 
temperature. The immunofluorescent signal of the HSL was observed with a fluorescence 
microscope (IX71, Olympus, Japan). 
 
5. Results 
 
5.1. Effect of limited hydrolysis of SPI on lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes 
 
The effects of hydrolysis time on the degree of hydrolysis (DH, %) and yield were studied. 
Under pH 7.0 and 50℃, SPI was hydrolyzed by Flavourzyme for 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h to obtain 
hydolysates with DH of 4.17, 7.42, 9.49, 11.71 and 12.95% as well as with yield of 0.47, 0.65, 
0.90, 1.01 and 1.14 mg TCA soluble nitrogen/mL, respectively. Both DH and yield increased with 
the increase in hydrolysis time. Although a higher DH resulted in a greater yield, it did not assure 
the ability to reduce lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells. Fig. 1 illustrates the effect of 
Flavourzyme-SPI hydrolysates (FH) with different DH on relative lipid accumulation (RLA) in 
3T3-L1 adipocytes. A lower RLA represents a higher activity for lipid reduction in the cells. All 
FH with DH 7.42-12.95 % showed a significant reduction of RLA compared with intact SPI (DH 
0%). The hydrolysate produced by hydrolyzing SPI with Flavourzyme for 2 h (FH2h) with DH 
7.42 had the lowest RLA. The result also indicated that extensive hydrolysis with a DH greater 
than 2 h might not guarantee a further enhancement in the reduction of RLA and lipolytic activity. 
However, it did imply that limited hydrolysis was required to maintain the structure or sequence of 
 5 
immunofluorescent signals (bright ring-loop) of HSL surrounding the lipid droplet peripheries in 
the cells after 48 h incubation (Fig. 6). 
 
6. Discussions 
 
 Limited enzymatic hydrolysis has been widely applied to increase the functionality of dietary 
protein in the food industry (Adler-Nissen, 1982). If the hydrolysis is not limited, and goes too far, 
it will usually result in a hydrolysate with uninteresting functional properties (Adler-Nissen, 1982). 
During protein hydrolysis with proteases, controlling DH is essential for specific properties of 
protein hydrolysates (Adler-Nissen, 1979). The result of our study suggests that SPI should be 
hydrolyzed with Flavourzyme for 2 h at pH 7.0 and 50 ℃ in order to obtain hydrolysate (FH2h) 
with DH as close as possible to 7.42%. Extensive hydrolysis of SPI with a DH of more than 9.49% 
did not guarantee any further enhancement of lipolysis-stimulating activity, but it did imply that 
limited hydrolysis was required to maintain the structure or sequence of the active peptides and to 
ensure functionality. Several studies also indicated that extensive hydrolysis resulted in a reduction 
in specific functionality (Tsou et al., 2009; Tsou et al., 2010).  
In our study, sequential fractionation of FH2h with different MWCO membranes showed the 
potential to enhance its lipolysis-stimulating activity in terms of triglyceride residue (TR). The 1 
kDa retentate could significantly decrease FH2h TR from 2.73 to 2.30 mole/ mg protein in the 
adipocytes. The enhancement of bioactive activities by fractionating with different MWCO 
membranes has been described in many studies (Chiang et al., 2006; Chiang et al., 2008). Based on 
the HPSEC molecular weight distribution analysis, the lipolysis-stimulating peptide mixtures in 
the 1kDa retentate were primarily composed of peptides with a molecular weight between 1,300 
and 2,200 Da. Some food-protein-derived functional peptides failed to express their activity after 
oral administration in vivo (Fujita, Yokoyama & Yoshikawa, 2000). Therefore, the 1 kDa retentate 
was investigated for its activity in vitro by treating it with gastrointestinal proteases, including 
pepsin and a combination of pepsin and pancreatin, respectively. The results indicated that 
gastrointestinal proteases have no significant effect (p > 0.05) on the lipolysis-stimulating activity. 
Several previous reports also concluded that small peptides have a low susceptibility for being 
hydrolyzed by gastric proteases (Grimble et al.,1987; Tsou et al., 2009). According to the MTT 
test on cell viability, 1 kDa retentate in the range of 400-1600 ppm was not toxic to 3T3-L1 
adipocytes (data not shown).  
Adipocytes lipolysis is the lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of triglycerides to glycerol and free fatty 
acids, which is physiologically stimulated by catecholamines through elevating cAMP and 
activating cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) (Londos et al.,1999). PKA phosphorylates 
HSL and causes translocation of HSL from the cytosol to the lipid droplets (Sztalryd et al., 2003), 
an action that enhances the breakdown of triglycerides (Londos et al., 1999; Tansey et al., 2004). 
Since ATGL and HSL account for 95% of the lipolysis in adipocytes (Schweiger et al., 2006), the 
protein expression of these enzymes was the primary focus of our investigation. The results 
indicated that 50 ppm 1 kDa retentate had no significant effect on the ATGL protein expression 
after 12-72 h incubation in the adipocytes (data not shown). On the other hand, a significant 
increase of phospho-HSL protein expression resulting in a significant decrease of HSL protein 
expression was observed during the 48-72 h incubation of adipocytes. Based on immunostaining 
analysis, the translocation of HSL from the cytosol to the surface of the lipid droplets was 
confirmed. Therefore, lipolysis-stimulating activity of 1 kDa retentate is the result of increasing the 
phosphorylation and translocation of HSL in the adipocytes.  
In addition to HSL and ATGL, perilipin also plays an important role on lipolysis regulation. 
Perilipin is located on the lipid droplet surface of adipocytes and is phosphorylated by activated 
PKA. The phosphorylation contributes to lipolysis since it prevents perilipin from inhibiting lipase 
activity (Sztalryd et al., 2003; Carmen & Víctor, 2006). In addition, many other signaling
