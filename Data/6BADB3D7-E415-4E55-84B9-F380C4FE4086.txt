A.   GMSK Signals 
 
The binary GMSK transmitted signal can be written as   
     ( ) ( )( )2 cos 2 ,cEs t πf t tT φ= + α                              (1) 
where E is the energy per symbol, T is the duration of a symbol 
interval, cf  is the carrier frequency, and ),( αφ t  represents the 
time-varying information carrying phase. The term α is the input 
binary data sequence. The information carrying phase can be 
expressed as:

)(tg  is usually truncated to a pulse of duration LT and shifting to 
start from zero. The time bandwidth product BT of GMSK will 
affect the signal spectrum. The smaller BT will have a more 
compact spectrum. The phase shaping function ( )q t  is obtained 
from the integral of ( )g t  given as

For BT = 0.3 GMSK signal )(tg  is truncated to a duration of L = 
3, as most of the pulse energy is concentrated within that duration. 
 
B.    Differential Detection 
 
The block diagram of one-bit differential detector is shown in 
Figure 1 [9]. The received signal at the input of the IF band pass 
filter (BPF) is contaminated by additive white Gaussian noise 
(AWGN) with one-sided spectral density N0. It is assumed 
hereafter that the BPF is ideal, and the time varying envelope of 
the signal and the distorted signal phase due to the filtering 
introduced by the BPF are ignored.

Define rI(t), rQ(t) as  ( ) ( ) ( )tntstr cII +=                            (6)

Then, assume that 2 2cf T kπ π=  where k is an integer and the 
output of the one-bit differential detector d(t) can be  
expressed as

The decision rule of the receiver is that a “0” was sent if ( ) 0<kTd  and a “1” was sent otherwise. Since the envelope r(t) 
is always positive (see (9)), the equivalent decision rule can be 
written as:

B. Receiver  
 
The receiver for the proposed system is shown in Figure 8, 
where a differential phase detector produces equation (16), the 
differential phase of the signals. Then a four states inner decoder 
is iteratively decoding with the outer convolutional decoder using 
the MAP algorithm [11]. After sufficient iteration, decisions are 
made for the information bits.

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS 
 
Simulation results are given for the proposed system using a 
rate 1/2 four states outer convolution code with octal generators 
(5, 7) and S-random interleaver of length 1024 bits with S = 16 
[12] throughout this paper. We will first show the importance of 
using precoder to improve the performance with iterative 
decoding in the AWGN channel, and then the BER performance 
for different BT’s of GMSK. We also compare our results with 
previous work [10]. Finally, the BER performance in flat 
Rayleigh fading is given.  
 
A. Effect of Precoder 
 
First, in Figure 9 we show the performances of one-bit 
differential detection of serial concatenated GMSK without using 
precoder, where different number of iterations are conducted for 
BT = 0.3. It is seen that further performance improvement is 
negligible as iteration is greater than 3. 
Secondly, a rate-1 precoder is employed to the transmitter. As 
specified in the previous section, the inner MAP decoder at the 
receiver is conducted on the combined trellis of precoder and 
feedforward TDL. The BER performance is shown in Figure 10. 
One can see that significant improvement is possible for the 
iterative decoding using more iteration. There are about 3 dB 
performance gains using 8 iterations, compared to 1 iteration, at 
BER = 10-4.

concatenated coded GMSK (BT=0.3) without precoder in the AWGN.

V. CONCLUSIONS 
 
The performance of one-bit differential detected serially 
concatenated precoded GMSK using iterative decoding is 
investigated. By using a rate-1 precoder with GMSK, the DPD 
detection structure has not only a recursive structure but also has 
complexity significantly lower than previous coherent and 
noncoherent receiver [4],[5]. In fact, there are only 4 states 
required in the inner MAP decoder. Simulation results show that 
iteratively decoding with precoded GMSK, using the proposed 
one-bit differential detected concatenated scheme, improves the 
system performance significantly. In addition, the proposed 
system outperforms the previous work [10], especially in fading 
channel. However, there is still room for improving the 
performance by using sophisticated differential detection 
technique [15]. It will be the future works to explore.
