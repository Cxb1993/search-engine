the vertical hydride storage vessel could be attributed to a pulverization-densification 
mechanism.  At a given vessel position, the hoop strain was increased with increasing 
packing fraction from 50 to 70 vol%.  For a 50-vol% packing fraction, the wall deformation 
as well as hydrogen storage capacity was enlarged when the initial powder size was increased 
from 200 mesh (74 m) to 100 mesh (149 m).  After 50 cycles of hydriding/dehydriding 
reactions, the particle size was reduced from approximately 149 or 74 m to 1 m.

1. Introduction 
 
 Magnesium is considered a promising medium for on-board hydrogen storage due to its 
high hydrogen storage capacity and low cost, as compared to other metals [1,2].  Magnesium 
hydride, MgH2, can absorb as high as 7.6 wt% of hydrogen [3].  However, there are certain 
limitations of pure magnesium for use as a hydrogen storage medium, including susceptibility 
to oxidation, slow hydriding/dehydriding kinetics, and high temperature of hydrogen 
desorption [1,2]. Therefore, a pure magnesium is usually alloyed with other elements to 
overcome some of the disadvantages to certain extents.  Among the alloys developed in this 
regard, Mg2Ni is the most popular alloy which can reduce the dehydrogenation temperature 
[4,5].  In addition, nickel also can facilitate the dissociation of molecular hydrogen on the 
surface of the hydrogen storage media to improve the kinetics of a hydriding/dehydriding 
process [6].  Mg2Ni and its modified alloys have been the focus in many studies [1,2].  The 
hydrogen storage capacity of the hydride of Mg2Ni, Mg2NiH4, is about 3.6 wt%, which is 
better than that of other types of non-Mg-based metal hydrides [2,3].  Although Mg2Ni 
usually has to absorb/desorb hydrogen at temperature higher than 200 oC, the plateau slope 
and cyclic stability characteristics expressed in the pressure-composition-isotherm (PCI) 
curves of Mg2Ni are good for practical application [7,8].  Therefore, Mg2Ni is a favorable 
hydrogen storage candidate for vehicular application due to its high gravimetric hydrogen 
storage capacity, low cost, and low-toxicity [1,2].  Mg2Ni is thus chosen as the hydrogen 
storage material investigated in the current study. 
 For metal hydrides to be used in many applications, they need to be filled into a reactor, so 
called hydride storage vessel, in which hydriding and dehydriding reactions take place.  A 
 2
processes are explored.  It is hoped that the characteristics of wall deformation induced by 
Mg2NiH4 formation presented in the current study is helpful for design and future applications 
of high-temperature Mg2Ni storage vessels. 
 
2. Experimental Procedures 
 
2.1. Experimental setup 
 
 Figure 1 shows the geometry and dimensions of the hydride storage vessel designed and 
made in house.  The wall thickness of the cylindrical vessel is 1 mm.  The volume of the 
interior space in the cylindrical vessel is 20 cm3.  The vessel is made of an AISI 316 stainless 
steel.  Wall strain measurements during cyclic hydriding/dehydriding reactions were 
performed using the experimental setup shown in Fig. 2.  SV1-SV8 are the solenoid valves 
used to control the hydrogen flow route.  P1-P3 are the pressure transducers used to monitor 
the extracting hydrogen pressure, input hydrogen pressure, and hydrogen pressure in the 
hydride storage vessel, respectively.  A 0.5-m-grade tubular filter is attached at the top 
flange of the hydride storage vessel to prevent Mg2Ni powders being extracted out by the 
vacuum pump.  A heating coil attached with a thermocouple is wrapped up in an insulation 
box to heat up the hydride storage vessel.  The gas pipes are connected with a hydrogen 
chamber which is used to provide a sufficient volume of hydrogen for hydriding reaction. 
 Three NiCr-coil type high-temperature strain gages (H1, H2, and H3) are pasted on the 
exterior wall surface of the cylindrical vessel.  Strain gages H1-H3 are used to measure the 
hoop strains at the locations of 7/10, 3/10, and 1/10 height of the vertical vessel from the 
bottom, respectively.  All the steps during cyclic hydriding/dehydriding processes are 
controlled by a programmable logic controller (PLC).  The wall strain and hydrogen pressure 
data during hydriding/dehydriding processes are monitored and recorded through a data 
acquisition system (strainmeter) and a personal computer (PC). 
 
2.2. Material and cyclic hydriding/dehydriding processes  
 
 The hydrogen storage alloy, Mg2Ni, used in the current study was provided by Hsu et al. 
[22] in the form of ingot made by an innovative mass production technique.  The 
hydriding/dehydriding PCI curves of the given Mg2Ni alloy at 255-350oC have been 
comprehensively studied by Hsu et al. [22].  The hydrogen storage capacity of the given 
 4
the reaction vessel was released to the atmosphere first.  Hence, the measured strain at H3 
showed a sudden decrease.  After that, the hydrogen desorbed by the metal hydrides was 
extracted to the atmosphere continuously by the vacuum pump.  The measured strain at H3 
finally reached a lower level at the end of the dehydriding process as the Mg2NiH4 hydrides 
decomposed hydrogen continuously.  Generally, the measured strains include the strains 
caused by metal hydride expansion and hydrogen pressure.  The wall strain caused by the 
residual hydrogen pressure at the absorption step was determined and subtracted from the 
measured strain.  In this regard, only the strain data caused by volume expansion of metal 
hydride formation are presented for the absorption step.  In the following discussion, strain 
values at the end of the absorption and desorption steps in each cycle are taken as the data 
points to show the variation of strain with cycle number for each given test. 
 
3. Results and Discussion  
 
3.1 Strain variation at various vessel positions 
 
 Figure 4 shows the hoop strains of various wall positions at the end of the absorption and 
desorption steps in each cycle for a 50-vol% packing fraction with an initial powder size of 
200 mesh.  The solid and open symbols represent the absorption and desorption steps, 
respectively.  H1, H2, and H3 represent the locations of 7/10, 3/10, and 1/10 height, 
respectively.  As shown in Fig. 4, the strain values of H1 are around zero throughout the test, 
indicating that hydride-expansion induced wall deformation barely took place at 7/10 height 
of the vessel.  However, the strain values of H2 and H3 are greater than zero.  The strain 
values of H3 are generally larger than those of H2 and H1 for a given cycle number.  For a 
packing fraction of 50 vol%, the height of the Mg2Ni powder bed is lower than that of 
position H1.  As a result, wall strains measured at the location of 7/10 height (H1) of the 
vessel were apparently only affected by the hydrogen gas pressure, while the effect of volume 
expansion of metal hydride formation was absent at H1.  On the other hand, the effect of 
volume expansion of metal hydride formation was indeed present at positions H2 and H3.  
The volume expansion and contraction of Mg2Ni/Mg2NiH4 powders during the 
hydriding/dehydriding processes could cause the alloy powders to pulverize.  When 
hydrogen atoms enter into an alloy’s lattice, the resultant lattice expansion induces significant 
microstresses to cause alloy fragmentation [23].  Such alloy pulverization could give rise to 
particle sedimentation and agglomeration leading to an accumulation of macrostress with 
 6
by the volume expansion of Mg2NiH4 formation and localized densification of Mg2Ni 
powders were increased with cycle number leading to the strain accumulation. 
 
3.2 Effects of packing fraction 
 
 Figure 7 shows the hoop strains of positions H1, H2, and H3 at the end of the absorption 
and desorption steps in each cycle for a 70-vol% packing fraction with an initial powder size 
of 200 mesh.  When the packing fraction was increased to 70 vol%, a slight strain 
accumulation at the location of 7/10 height (H1) was observed.  This implies that the top of 
the Mg2Ni powder bed is around this height such that the volume expansion of hydride 
formation induced a certain extent of deformation at H1.  In addition, the absorption strain 
values at H2 and H3 were very close to each other except for some points before the 15th 
cycle, as shown in Fig. 7.  In the early cycles, the gaps between Mg2Ni powders were large 
enough so that the pulverized powders could easily fall down through the gaps to increase the 
local powder density at lower positions.  Again, the local powder density was thus increased 
from the top to the bottom of the vessel.  Hence, at the beginning of the cyclic test, the strain 
values of H3 at the hydrogen absorption steps were larger than those of H2.  After the 15th 
cycle, the local powder density was about the same at both H2 and H3 until the final stage of 
test, for a 70-vol% packing fraction of Mg2Ni powders with an initial size of 200 mesh. 
 Comparisons of the strain variation in two packing fractions at the locations of 3/10 (H2) 
and 1/10 (H3) height for an initial powder size of 200 mesh are shown in Fig. 8.  Apparently, 
at both positions, a larger packing fraction gave rise to greater wall strains.  This is attributed 
to a greater amount of pulverized, fine powders generated in a larger packing fraction of 
Mg2Ni powders.  It would make the distribution of alloy powders at lower positions more 
densified under the effect of gravity.  Consequently, the local powder density at H2 and H3 
was higher in the case of 70 vol% than in the case of 50 vol%.  Therefore, when the packing 
fraction was increased to a level of 70 vol%, the hoop strains measured at these positions 
during the hydriding/dehydriding processes were greater than those of 50 vol%. 
 In the aspect of hydrogen storage capacity of reaction vessel for these two packing 
fractions, the amounts of hydrogen content absorbed per unit mass of Mg2Ni in the first 10 
cycles of test and after the 50-cycle test are listed in Table 1.  As shown in Table 1, for 
Mg2Ni powders with an initial size of 200 mesh, the average hydrogen storage capacity in the 
first 10 cycles is 3.20 wt% and 2.92 wt% for the 50-vol% and 70-vol% packing fraction, 
respectively.  The densified, agglomerated stack of fine Mg2Ni powders formed at the 
 8
an initial powder size of 200 mesh (Fig. 4), strain accumulation phenomena were also present 
at the two lower positions, H2 and H3, in the case of 100 mesh (Fig. 10).  As shown in Fig. 
10, a larger wall strain occurred at a lower position such that H3 had the largest deformation 
among the given three positions.  Note that the particle size of 100 mesh (149 m) is larger 
than that of 200 mesh (74 m).  In comparison of Figs. 4 and 10, a greater extent of 
difference in the strain values between H2 and H3 is found for the case of 100 mesh.  This is 
attributable to the size of gaps between the Mg2Ni powders packed in the vessel.  Before the 
activation process, the shape of Mg2Ni powders was sharp and irregular, as shown in Fig. 5(a).  
Particle size is a factor in influencing the size of gaps between Mg2Ni powders.  A larger, 
initial particle size would generate larger gaps such that the pulverized, fine powders could 
fall downward more easily through these larger gaps.  Consequently, the local powder 
density at a lower position such as H3 is expected to be greater in the case of a larger, initial 
particle size.  Hence, the difference between the absorption strains of H2 and H3 in the case 
of an initial particle size of 100 mesh (Fig.10) is much larger than that of 200 mesh (Fig. 4).  
Note that after a 50-cycle test, the particle size of Mg2Ni powders was reduced to about 1 m 
for both given initial particle sizes, as shown in Fig. 5(b). 
 Figure 11 shows comparisons of the wall strains at locations of 3/10 height (H2) and 1/10 
height (H3) for a packing fraction of 50 vol% with two different initial particle sizes (100 and 
200 mesh).  Apparently, at a given position on the vessel wall, a larger, initial particle size 
gave rise to greater hoop strains.  In addition, such an increase in the magnitude of wall 
deformation caused by a larger, initial size of Mg2Ni powders is dependent on the wall 
position.  The extent of difference in the absorption strain between the given two initial 
particle sizes at H3 (Fig. 11(b)) is much larger than that at H2 (Fig. 11(a)).  As described 
above, larger gaps were presumably formed in the reaction vessel initially packed with a 
larger size of Mg2Ni powders so that more pulverized, fine alloy powders aggregated at a 
lower position such as H3.  Therefore, the extent of difference in the local powder density 
between H3 and H2 was enlarged when the initial particle size of Mg2Ni powders was 
increased from 200 mesh (74 m) to 100 mesh (149 m). 
 As shown in Table 1, the average hydrogen storage capacity at the first 10 cycles in a 
50-vol% packing fraction is 3.20 wt% for 200 mesh and 3.23 wt% for 100 mesh.  At the end 
of a 50-cycle test, the hydrogen storage capacity is 2.56 and 2.88 wt% for 200 and 100 mesh, 
respectively.  Apparently, for given a packing fraction of 50 vol% of Mg2Ni powders, the 
hydrogen storage capacity of the reaction vessel is greater for a larger, initial particle size of 
 10
(3) Agglomerated Mg2Ni powders were found at the bottom of the reaction vessel after the 
cyclic hydriding/dehydriding tests.  Such an agglomeration phenomenon had a 
detrimental influence on the hydrogen delivery inside the reaction vessel such that the 
hydrogen storage capacity of the investigated cases did not reach the expected value.  A 
greater degradation of absorbed hydrogen content was found in the vessel packed with a 
smaller, initial particle size, as the agglomeration phenomenon tended to occur more 
easily for a smaller, initial powder size. 
(4) For a 50-vol% packing fraction of Mg2Ni powders, a larger, initial particle size induced a 
greater surface strain on the vessel wall, due to a larger hydrogen storage capacity and a 
greater local powder density at lower positions of the vessel. 
(5) Regardless of the initial size of Mg2Ni powders given in the current study, the alloy 
particles were reduced to a size of about 1 m after a 50-cycle hydriding/dehydriding test 
due to a pulverization mechanism.
