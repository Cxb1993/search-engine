where    is the projected

signals of the user of interest,  
s
w w=N U N
( )w iX   
also contains signals intended for other 
unknown co-channel users which are 
referred to as the MAIs. The co-channel 
users are unknown in the sense that the 
spreading sequences of the MAIs are 
unknown to the user of interest. Therefore, 
MAI suppression is inevitable in the STS 
tree structure. Since all the co-channel 
users possess the same spatial signatures, 
the MAIs can not possibly be eliminated 
in the space domain. However, the 
spreading sequences dedicated to the user 
of interest make the MAI suppression 
feasible in the time domain. In the T-layer 
of the STS tree structure, the proposed 
algorithm suppresses the MAIs by using a 
temporal filter, as will be discussed next. 
Delay Estimation, MAI Suppression 
and Path Isolation 
Taking over the outputs of the S-layer, 
the T-layer in Fig. 1 aims at the goals of 
delay estimation, MAI suppression, and 
path isolation. The T-MUSIC algorithm is 
first applied to matrix  of each 
group for delay estimation. For those 
multipaths with distinct DOAs but with 
close-by delays, after the spatial grouping 
conducted in the previous S-layer, the 
signals of these multipaths are now in 
different spatial groups. Since the 
T-MUSIC is applied to each group 
separately, the close-by delays of the 
multipaths can be estimated independently 
and accurately without much mutual 
interference, and this is impossible 
without the cooperation between the 
S-layer and the T-layer. With the delay 
estimate  
( )w iX
 ̂ w , p    available, we can 
reconstruct the temporal signatures as  
 S m , 1T g  ̂ w , p    . According to the temporal 
signature estimates, the STS tree structure 
is now ready to eliminate the MAIs and 
isolate each individual path by a temporal 
filter. Temporal filters can be designed 
either in the COP sense which is similar to 
the design earlier or in the minimum 
variance distortionless response (MVDR) 
sense. We only present the MVDR 
temporal filter herein for simplicity. The 
MVDR filters have been deployed in 
many signal processing applications, such 
as spatial beamformers and frequency 
filters, which seek to find an optimum 
weight vector so as to minimize both the 
interference and the noise at the filter

Simulations and Discussions 
Consider a and   system 
with half wavelength spaced ULA at both 
the transmitter and the receiver. 
Differentially encoded data sequences, 
each spreaded with a gold code sequence 
of length , are transmitted over 
the channel.

We assume a Rayleigh-fading multipath 
channel with two groups of totally 3 paths 
seen at the receiver for the user of interest. 
The DOAs and delays of the three paths 
are, respectively,

and [ ]0.24 2.12 0.22 ,c cT T Tτ = c

where  0.8cT µ=   is the chip period.  
Fig.2-3 compare the root mean square 
errors (RMSE) of the channel parameters 
estimates provided by the STS-based 
algorithms with those provided by the 
JADE-MUSIC algorithm [4] which is 
believed of high accuracy yet high 
computational complexity. As shown in 
Figs. 2-3, due to the proposed MAI 
suppression, the STS-based algorithms 
suffer less RMSE in DOA estimation than 
the JADE-MUSIC algorithm. However, 
the JADE-MUSIC performs better in the 
delay estimation than the STS-based 
algorithms since the delay estimation done 
in the STS based algorithms obtains no 
help from the MAI suppression. In 
addition, in low SNR environment, due to 
the self cancellation caused by the 
inaccurate DOA-delay estimates, the 
STS-MVDR algorithm shows higher 
RMSE than the STS-COP algorithm. With 
the estimated DOAs and delays, Fig. 4 
compares the BERs of the STS-based 
MUDs with the space-time RAKE 
receiver [5] and the space time minimum 
mean square error (ST-MMSE) algorithm 
[6]. It is shown that, in the presence of 
MAIs, the BER of the STS-MVDR 
algorithms almost approach to that of the 
ST-MMSE algorithm.
