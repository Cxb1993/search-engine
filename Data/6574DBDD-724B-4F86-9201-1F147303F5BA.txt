 the Cpm expression is necessitated, particularly for 
exploring off-line PCI applications in product 
design and process planning.  
 For on-line PCI applications, Cpm has process 
mean and process variance that are the realized 
quality values obtained from the existing product 
or process. Conversely, for the off-line PCI 
application, Cpm has process mean and process 
variance as two unknown variables, which the 
design engineers would need to determine. Under 
these circumstances, when cost is not considered 
as a factor for off-line PCI analysis, the designers 
naturally would set the process mean at the 
design target and minimize the process variance 
to the lowest limit. Apparently, the decided mean 
and variance values are incorrect because the 
additional production cost incurred for tightening 
the variance through tolerance design is not 
considered; intuitively, the establishment of mean 
and variance values will result in a high Cpm 
value [5]. In these regards, motivation to develop 
a PCI expression for off-line application becomes 
necessary.   To extend Cpm for an Off-line PCI 
application, the expression of Cpm must be 
revised with relevant cost factors being included. 
The costs in consideration are quality loss and 
production cost. The quality loss is expressed by 
quality loss function, and the production cost is 
represented by tolerance cost function. 
Consequently, designer engineers will not 
attempt to raise the PCI value by locating the 
process mean near the design target without 
rational consideration, and by reducing the 
tolerance value without cost consciousness. In 
this research, the duration of the off-line 
application contains the pre-production stage and 
on-production stage, and the period of on-line 
application includes the post-production stage. 
With developed PCI expression for off-line 
application, process mean and process tolerance 
are predetermined by design engineers at the pre-
production stage. Then, process engineers would 
establish process mean and process tolerance as 
predetermined values at the on-production stage. 
Finally, the PCI expression for on-line 
application is used for measuring and analyzing 
the actual outputs at the post-production stage. 
This conclusion is demonstrated in the examples 
presented in this research. As a result, an 
economic and quality process capability analysis 
for a life application, including pre-production 
stage, on-production stage, and post-production 
stage, becomes possible. 
 
 
II.  QUALITY LOSS AND PRODUCTION 
COST 
 
The average quality loss in its symmetric 
quality loss function is the following [9,16]: 
E[L(X)] = 2 2[( ) ]K U T σ− +                                       
(1) 
To evaluate the production cost, this 
research adopts the tolerance cost function as 
developed in the literature [3]: 
CM(t) = a ＋ b ． exp (–c t )                  
(2) 
 where a, b, and c are the coefficients for the 
tolerance      
                  cost function, and t is the process 
tolerance. 
 
 
III. PROCESS CAPABILITY  
DEVELOPMENT 
 
The proposed process capability expression for 
the case of single quality characteristic:

U tT
                       
(3) 
As is known, a lower quality loss (a better 
quality) implies a higher tolerance cost and a 
higher quality loss (a poorer quality) indicates a 
lower tolerance cost [5]. Hence, the mean U and 
tolerance t must be adjusted to reach a balance 
between the quality loss and the tolerance cost, 
enabling the PCI expression, Cpmc, to be 
maximized before the product design and  
process planning is realized.. See the difference 
between Cpm and Cpmc  shown in Figures  ? and ?.    
The following formulation attempts to 
devise the process capability expression for the 
case of multiple quality characteristics applied in 
process planning via mathematical programming: 
 
 2
 the reference surface, and the processed surface. 
Table 2 contains feasible design space for 
process value Ui and process capability limits 
for process tolerance ti. Table 3 also provides 
tolerance cost coefficients ai, bi, and ci for 
component i. Table 3 gives three levels of 
tolerance cost coefficient ci for process tolerance 
ti. The reason for making available three levels 
of quality loss coefficients K and tolerance cost 
coefficient ci is to complete the sensitivity 
analysis for the purpose of comparison. 
Based on given conditions from these tables, 
the problem is formulated via one of the 
optimization techniques such as mathematical 
programming. The objective intends to find 
optimal parameter and tolerance values so that 
the Cpmc is maximized under a set of process 
constraints. The problem formulation is based 
on the model development in (3)-(13). A further 
study is carried with the same formulation 
except that objective function Cpmc is replaced 
with the expression of Cp or Cpk. The results 
along with the above outcomes are summarized 
in Table 4. Clearly, Cpmc mirrors relevant 
quality and cost sensitively and is most 
applicable during the stage of product design.
