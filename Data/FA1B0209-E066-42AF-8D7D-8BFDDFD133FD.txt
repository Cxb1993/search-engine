Abstract 
This is a three-year subproject (2005/8~ 
2008/7). The main purpose of this sub-project 
is to implement the needed low-noise 
amplifiers (LNAs), voltage controlled 
oscillators (VCOs), and related circuit blocks 
for wireless biomedical sensor network (WBSN) 
systems on a chip (SOC). The goal of this year 
(the third year) is the implementation of the 
needed VCOs for WBSN SOC. The main focus 
of our research was to propose a design method 
of VCOs, which could achieve simultaneous 
optimization of power consumption, output 
power, and phase noise. 
Noteworthily, in this sub-project, we 
propose the concept of "partial pattern-ground- 
shield (PPGS)" to improve the performances of 
RF passive devices, such as inductors and 
transformers [1]-[2]. PPGS could be achieved 
after the redundant PGS of a traditional 
complete PGS, right below the (spiral) metal 
 3
an overall dimension of 96 μm × 100 μm. Note 
that AA with ~0.2-μm-deep P+ implantation, 
which is normally used as dopant of drain/ 
source terminals of pMOSFETs, was added 
beneath the inductor in the shape of mesh to 
reduce its capacitive and magnetic coupling 
with the substrate. In this way, the NF of the 
inductor could be improved. The width and 
space of both the transverse and vertical AA- 
strip were 1 μm. That is, the size of the STI 
(shallow trench isolation) grids of the AA-mesh 
was 1 μm × 1 μm (see Fig. 1(b)). An inductor 
with the same layout on normal silicon 
substrate (STD inductor) was also implemented 
for comparison (not shown here).  
Fig. 2 shows the small-signal equivalent 
circuit model of an inductor on a silicon 
substrate [18]. Table I is a summary of the 
extracted small-signal parameters of the 
inductor LG1 both with and without P+-AA- 
mesh beneath it. The fact that the inductor LG1 
with P+-AA-mesh exhibits smaller Cox1, Cox2, 
Csub1, and Csub2, and larger Rsub1 and Rsub2, is 
attributed to the reduction of the capacitive and 
magnetic coupling between the inductor and 
the substrate. That the inductor LG1 with P+- 
AA-mesh exhibits smaller Rs1 is attributed to 
the P+ implantation in the AA-mesh area, 
which reduces the resistivity on the surface of 
the substrate. This in turn results in a larger 
equivalent series metal resistance [18]. 
Fig. 3 shows the directly measured, 
calculated, and modeled NFmin versus 
frequency characteristics of the inductor LG1 
both with and without P+-AA-mesh beneath it. 
As can be seen, a 0.48 dB improvement (from 
0.84 dB to 0.34 dB) was achieved at 10 GHz 
for inductor LG1 if the P+-AA-mesh had been 
added beneath it, which means the P+-AA-mesh 
was efficient to improve the NF performance of 
RF passive devices and could be very 
promising for RFIC applications.  
Fig. 4(a) shows the complete schematic 
of the 3.1-10.6 GHz CMOS UWB LNA, in 
which the important device parameters are 
labeled. Two CMOS UWB LNAs with device 
parameters listed in Fig. 4(a) were implemented. 
One was with standard inductors (STD UWB- 
LNA). The other (AA-Mesh UWB-LNA) was 
made up of the same layout except that 
P+-AA-mesh is added beneath its input 
inductors LG1 and LS1. Fig. 4(b) shows the die 
photo of the AA+Mesh UWB-LNA.  
Fig. 5(a) shows the measured S11 versus 
frequency characteristics of the STD UWB- 
LNA and the AA+Mesh UWB LNA. Over the 
3.1-10.6-GHz-band of interest, S11 of -9.7~ 
-19.9 dB was achieved for the STD UWB-LNA, 
and S11 of -9.84~ -18.1 dB was achieved for the 
AA+Mesh UWB-LNA. What is also shown in 
Fig. 5(a) are the measured S22 versus frequency 
characteristics of the STD UWB-LNA and the 
AA+PPGS UWB LNA. Over the 3.1-10.6- 
GHz-band of interest, S22 of -8.4~ -22.5 dB was 
achieved for the STD UWB-LNA, and S22 of 
-7.89~ -20.9 dB was achieved for the AA+ 
Mesh UWB-LNA. Fig. 5(b) shows the 
measured S21 versus frequency characteristics. 
Over the 3.1-10.6-GHz-band of interest, high 
and flat S21 of 11.4± 0.4 dB was achieved for 
the STD UWB-LNA, and high and flat S21 of 
11.15 ± 0.65 dB was achieved for the AA+ 
Mesh UWB-LNA. The reason why the 
measured S21 of the AA+Mesh UWB-LNA is a 
little lower than the STD UWB-LNA is 
because the P+ implantation in the AA-mesh 
area reduced the resistivity on the surface of the 
silicon substrate (see parameter Rs1 in Table I). 
What is also shown in Fig. 5(b) are the 
measured S12 versus frequency characteristics 
of the STD UWB-LNA and the AA+Mesh 
UWB LNA. Over the 3.1-10.6 GHz band of 
interest, good S12 of -40 ~ -48 dB was achieved 
for the STD UWB-LNA, and good S12 of -39.2 
~ -48 dB was achieved for the AA+Mesh 
UWB-LNA. Fig. 5(c) shows the measured NF 
versus frequency characteristics. Over the 
3.1-10.6 GHz band of interest, NF of 4.64±0.52 
dB was achieved for the STD UWB-LNA, and 
excellent NF of 3.365±0.225 dB was achieved 
for the AA+Mesh UWB-LNA. The achieved 
NF of 3.365±0.225 dB is better than the 
published results of the 3.1-10.6 GHz CMOS 
UWB-LNAs in [19]-[25].  
Table II is a summary of the implemented 
CMOS UWB LNAs, and recently reported 
state-of-the-art 0.18 μm CMOS UWB LNAs. 
As can be seen, compared with other works, 
our P+-AA-Mesh UWB-LNA exhibited the 
flattest S21, the best NF, power and phase 
linearity, and only occupied a small chip area.

the measurement results of the MMW CMOS 
dividers in [40]-[43] and the CMOS ILFDs in 
this work. Compared to Tiebout’s direct ILFD 
[40], our direct ILFD has a higher operating 
frequency and achieves a wider locking range, 
but consumes slightly more power. Compared 
to Huang and Chan’s ILFD [41], our direct 
ILFD has a higher operating frequency, 
achieves a wider locking range, and consumes 
less power. Compared to Lee and Razavi’s 
regenerative divider [42] and Yamamoto and 
Fujishima’s direct ILFD [43], our direct ILFD 
has a higher operating frequency and consumes 
less power, but achieves slightly narrower 
locking range. 
 
3.6 A Low-Power 48 GHz LC VCO Using 0.13 
μm CMOS Technology 
 
In recent years, several cross-coupled pair 
LC-tank VCOs above 40 GHz have been 
demonstrated [44]-[47]. In this work, NMOS 
cross-coupled structure is used for low-power 
LC VCO design. Fig. 11(a) and 11(b) shows 
the schematic and the die microphotograph of 
the VCO. The die size of this circuit is 0.94 μm 
× 0.9 μm (include DC pad and RF pad). This 
circuit has a cross-coupled connection of 
NMOS M1 and M2 (W/L= 12.8 μm/0.13 μm) to 
form a positive feedback loop for providing 
negative resistance to compensate the loss in 
the LC-tank, which is implemented by on-chip 
spiral inductor L1 and accumulation MOS 
(A-MOS) varactor Cvar. The bias current is 
injected in the middle of the inductor by a 
PMOS transistor M3 (W/L= 512.8 μm/0.35 
μm). This enables the modulation of the PMOS 
drain node by changing the Vg voltage, and use 
of PMOS current source allows utilization of 
the full range of the varactor without requiring 
tuning voltage above VDD or below zero. In this 
condition, the use of a PMOS tail-current 
source is justified since the PMOS transistors 
have lower 1/f noise than the NMOS. The 
length and the width of PMOS transistor must 
be increased to reduce the flicker noise which 
lowers significantly the close-in phase noise of 
the VCO.  
The VCO is measured on-wafer using an 
Agilent E4448A 50-GHz spectrum analyzer. 
The VCO core draws 4.63 mA from a 1.2V 
power supply. That is, the DC power 
consumption is only 5.56 mW. Fig. 11(c) 
shows the measured output spectrum at 48.589 
GHz. Table VIII is a summary of the 
measurement results of the CMOS VCOs in 
[44]-[47] and the CMOS VCO in this work. As 
can be seen, our 48 GHz CMOS VCO achieves 
a FOM of -183.85dbc/Hz, which are 
comparable with the state-of-the-art previous 
works.
