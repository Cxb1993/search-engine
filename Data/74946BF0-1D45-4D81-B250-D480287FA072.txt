Abstract: In this project, the problem of the delay-dependent non-fragile control for a class of linear 
large-scale systems with time delay in the state of each subsystem as well as in the interconnections is 
addressed in detail.  The additive gain variations under consideration are contained in the controller gain.  
By utilizing a model transformation and the Lyapunov stability theory, Novel delay-dependent criteria are 
derived to guarantee the stability of the non-fragile control system.  The controller gain is given from the 
LMI feasible solutions.  Computer software Matlab can be applied to solve all the proposed results.  Finally, 
a numerical example is given for illustration the design of the non-fragile control. 
Key words: delay-dependent non-fragile control, Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach, The controller 
gains. 
 
1. Introduction 
In the large-scale dynamical system, time delay naturally arises in the processing of information 
transmission between subsystems and its existence is frequently the main cause source of instability and 
oscillation in many important systems. Many practical control applications can be often encountered 
including electrical power systems, nuclear reactors, chemical process control systems, transportation 
systems, computer communication, economic systems, etc. In the recent years, the problem of stability 
analysis for large-scale systems with or without time delay has been extensively studied by a number of 
authors: see, for example, Refs. [3-12].  Moreover, by depending on whether the stability criterion itself 
contains the delay argument as a parameter, stability criteria for systems can be usually classified into two 
categories, namely delay-independent criterion: see, for example, Refs. [3-5, 7, 10-11] and delay-dependent 
criterion: see, for example, Ref. [9, 12].  In general, the latter ones are less conservative than the former 
ones.   
On the other hand, the non-fragile control problem has been an attractive topic in theory analysis and 
practical implement.  The non-fragile control concept is proposed to this new problem: how to design a 
feedback control that will be insensitive to some error in gains of feedback control [13].  Design of 
non-fragile PID control for a given interval plant had been considered [14].  Non-fragile guaranteed cost 
control for large-scale time-delay systems had been developed [15].  The non-fragile positive real control 
for a class of uncertain linear neutral time-delay systems had been proposed [16].  Non-fragile guaranteed 
cost control problem for discrete linear systems had been studied [17].  The design of non-fragile 
guaranteed cost control for uncertain descriptor systems with time-varying state and input delays had been 
provided [18].  However, the non-fragile control for a class of large-scale time-delay systems has never 
been considered in my best knowledge.  This has motivated my study.   
In this paper, delay-independent and delay-dependent criteria for such systems can be derived to 
guarantee the non-fragile control for large-scale systems with time delay in the state of each subsystem as 
well as in the interconnections.  Appropriate model transformation of nominal original systems is useful for 
the stabilty analysis of the systems, and some tuning parameters which satisfy constraint on the spectral 
radius and an LMIs can be easily obtained by the LMI technique.  A numerical example is given to 
illustrate that the proposed result is useful.

Then the system (12) is asymptotically stable for any constant time-delays  satisfying ijh ijij hh 0 ,

Remark 1: Notice that for any chosen matrix 0ijB , Nji , , it represents that the delay term 
  t ht jij ij dssxB )( , Nji ,  have not been converted to the left side of the system (12).  By the above 
Theorem 2, the corresponding matrices , , and , ijR ijkT ijkW Nkji ,,  could be chosen as zero matrices, 
and LMI the condition in (13) are reduced by their corresponding elements. 
 
 Letting , 0ijB Nji , , in Theorem 2, we achieve the following result that doesn’t depend on delay 
arguments.

Proof: The proof directly follows that the proof of Theorem 1 with 0ijB , Nji , .  
 
Remark 2: Suppose that for any chosen matrix ijij AB  , Nji , , it represents that the delay term 
  t ht jij ij dssxA )( , Nji ,  have been converted to the left side of the system (12).  By the proof of Lemma

 Simply choosing ijij AB  , Nji , , in Theorem 2, we achieve the following result that depend on
