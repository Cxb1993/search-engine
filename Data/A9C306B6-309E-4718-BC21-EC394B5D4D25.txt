Abstract 
In this paper a function approximation 
technique is proposed for adaptive 
backstepping design of a flexible–joint robot 
manipulator. The dynamics of the robot 
manipulator are derived with the assumption 
that all matrices in this robot model are 
unknown. Since these matrices are time 
varying and their variation bounds are not 
given, traditional adaptive or robust control 
schemes cannot be applied. The function 
approximation technique is employed here to 
represent uncertainties in some finite linear 
combinations of the orthogonal basis. Using the 
Lyapunov stability theory, a set of update law 
is derived to give closed loop stability with 
proper tracking performance.  A two-link 
flexible-joint robot is used in the experiment to 
verify validity and effectiveness of the 
proposed control law. 
Keywords: function approximation technique,

2.INTRODUCTION 
In many industrial applications, controller 
design of robot manipulators is based on the 
rigid-link assumption. However, robot 
manipulators usually have the problems of joint 
flexibility. Flexibility occurs in robots, when 
motion transmission elements such as long 
shafts, harmonic drivers and transmission belts 
are used. The joint flexibility is regarded as a 
source of problems, especially when high 
performance is to be achieved. The paper by 
Sweet and Good  [1] indicated that it could 
lead to instability while neglecting the joint 
flexibility in controller design. The 
experiments [1] also suggested that the 
designers should consider joint flexibility in 
both modeling and controller design if high 
performance is expected. Nevertheless, 
controller design of flexible-joint robot is more 
difficult due to the following two reasons. First, 
 
derived from the conventional Lyapunov 
design. By means of this manner, the value of 
uncertainty is estimated instantaneously for the 
control effort computation, and boundedness of 
error signal is also ensured at the same time. 
There are two approaches of FAT. The 
numerous one is state-dependent approximation 
model (abbreviated as SDAM), such as neural 
network (NN). The uncertainty is transformed 
into a function of system states, while using 
this method [21-25]. Other attempts to use 
time-dependent orthogonal basis functions as 
the approximator [15-20, 26]. In early stage, a 
common assumption of FAT approaches is 
assumed to be satisfied that all uncertainties are 
lying in the range space of control input. This 
assumption is called matching condition 
[27,28]. The dynamic system with matched 
uncertainty is showed as below

some recent publications [21-25] introduced 
NN into backstepping design to deal with the 
mismatched uncertain systems in following 
strict-feedback form [29] and pure-feedback 
form [23].

where [ ] mmxx ℜ∈= L1x  is the state 
vector, ℜ∈u  is the control input, ℜ∈y  is 
system output, ,  and  denote the 
unknown smooth functions. The NN is applied 
to represent these unknown functions as linear 
parameterized approximation models [24] so 
that the adaptive controller can be derived in a 
traditional-backstepping-like design procedure. 
A backstepping-based NN controller was first 
proposed by Polycarpou [24] to stabilize 
system in Eq. (2). From the viewpoint of 
system structure, the pure-feedback system 
represents a general class of triangular systems, 
which may have no direct appearance of the 
affine variables to be used as synthetic inputs. 
Owing this reason, it would more difficult to 
find a stable feedback law with explicit virtual 
controls for this kind of systems. Ge and Wang 
[23] developed an NN based backstepping 
scheme for pure-feedback system, upon the 
basis of the result in strict-feedback systems 
[25]. However, the knowledge for the bounds 
on pseudo-affine terms was very crucial. 
)(⋅f g )(⋅g
    The NN based backstepping design is an 
effective tool to attack nonlinear control 
problem and system uncertainties; nevertheless, 
it can only be applied to the systems that are 
transformable into strict-feedback form or 
pure-feedback form. The ball and beam system 
[30] is a well-known example that the 
backstepping cannot be designed even when 
the exact dynamics is given. In recent 
publications [17, 18, 31], a class of uncertain 
systems in following “perturbed 
chain-of-integrator” form [32] was considered 
 
some continuity and boundedness conditions. 
Thus, time-dependent FAT approaches can 
handle more general uncertainties, not just 
strict-feedback or pure-feedback mismatched 
uncertain systems.
In this paper, a time-dependent 
approximator is proposed for adaptive 
backstepping design of a two-link 
flexible–joint robot manipulator. The dynamics 
of the robot manipulator is derived with the 
assumption that all matrices in robot model are 
unknown. By selecting appropriate update law, 
the time derivative of some Lyapunov function 
candidate can be proved to be negative 
semi-definite. Furthermore, not only the 
convergence of tracking error but also 
boundedness of all signals can be obtained. The 
paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives 
formulation of an n-link flexible joint robot 
model and its associated properties. Section 3 
derives the adaptive backstepping design in 
detail. Section 4 shows the simulation results of 
the proposed control law for a two-link 
flexible-joint robot. Finally in Section 5, 
conclusions are briefly given. 
 
3.PROBLEM FORMULATION 
Consider the dynamic equations of an 
n-link flexible-joint robot manipulator with 
unknown parameters [3]: 
0)q-K(q)g(qq)q,C(qq)D(q 21111111 =+++ &&&&

u)qK(qqJ 122 =−+&&                                                                        
(6) 
where  and  represent the 
link angles and motor angles, respectively; 
 is a diagonal positive definite 
matrix representing the joint stiffness; 
 is the link inertia matrix;  
is the centrifugal matrix; represents  
the gravitational term;  is the input 
torque, and  is a diagonal positive 
definite matrix representing the actuator inertia. 
In this study, all system matrices are assumed 
to be unknown; nevertheless, the following 
properties [34] hold:

positive definite, and uniformly bounded. 
(2). With  chosen as in [20], the matrix 
 is skew symmetric and  is 
uniformly bounded. 
C

(3). The gravitation vector g  is uniformly 
bounded. 
From Eq. (5) and (6), we know that the robot is 
driven by motors through torsional springs. 
Therefore, the system can be separated into two 
subsystems, namely the robot dynamics by Eq. 
(5) and motor dynamics by Eq. (6). For the 
controller design based on cascade approach, 
we may derive the virtual control signals for 
robot subsystem, and then design the controller 
for motor subsystem to regulate the errors 
between virtual signals and motor angles. 
Hence, Eq (5) and (6) can be rewritten in 
cascade form as

subsequent section, backstepping design and 
function approximation technique are to be 
employed to develop the proposed control 
scheme.

coefficients. In general, spring coefficients are 
positive constants. Therefore, we known  is

the inertia matrix of robot. By property (1), we 
know that D  has some properties, such as

conclude that

Remark 4: To avoid the parameter drift due to

Remark 4: The convergence of  is to be 
derived in the next part for motor subsystem. 
To simplify the derivation in the following 
design, we only consider the case where 
sufficient basis functions are used. In practical, 
the number of basis function is chose by the 
bandwidth of system. In the simulation part, we 
used Fourier series as our function 
approximator.

    For robot case, we only chose 13 terms of

systems are low bandwidth system, thus we do 
not have to use too many bases function in our 
approximator. In general, too many bases may 
induce the noise in the approximation 
procedure.

6.CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we have proposed an adaptive 
backstepping design with function 
approximation technique for flexible joint robot 
without using regressor matrix. The 
convergence of tracking errors has been proved. 
However, the reference input does not satisfy 
the persistent excitation condition; therefore, 
the estimates do not converge to actual values, 
but all remain bounded. With the proposed 
controller, the control strategy does not require 
much information about the system model. 
Results of the experimentn justify the 
performance of the proposed controller. A 
system setup of a two-link flexible-joint robot 
manipulator is currently constructed for 
experimentally investigating the effectiveness 
of the proposed controller.

Abstract 
In this paper, an MR mount with flow mode operation is studied for vibration suppression 
subject to base excitations. Recently, magneto-rheological (MR) fluid has become a popular 
material for actuator use. There are some good properties associated with MR fluid such as the 
reversible, controllable, and continuous change of rheological characteristics upon application 
of magnetic field. However, the dynamic equation of MR mount is highly nonlinear, hence 
making the controller design an extremely difficult task. This paper aims to develop a 
semi-active control technique for suppressing vibration of an MR mount subject to its base 
disturbances. The adaptive control scheme is employed for vibration attenuation. Function 
approximation technique is used here to represent the unknown system dynamics including the 
external disturbance in some finite linear combination of the orthogonal basis. The dynamics of 
MR mount system can thus be proved to be a stable first order filter driven by function 
approximation errors. Moreover, the adaptive update law can be obtained by using the 
Lyapunov stability theory.  The well-known skyhook control scheme and a controller with 
constant applied magnetic field are to be compared with the proposed adaptive controller for 
semi-active vibration control of the MR mount. 
INTRODUCTION 
 
For vibration attenuation purpose, many kinds of products have been developed, such as 
dampers, shock absorbers and suspension system, etc. Severe vibration of a system can cause 
damage, even leading to safety problem. A lot of passive devices are used in engineering 
application to absorb or isolate unwanted vibration, but the adaptive ability of passive devices is 
poor. The semi-active control could provide better performance than the passive control, which 
has been stated in many fields by many researchers. Compared to the active control, the 
semi-active control has many advantages, such as low power requirement, higher reliability and 
simpler structure, etc [1-6].  
Recently, smart materials are applied widely and rapidly, such as liquid crystal, 
piezoelectric ceramics [7], magnetorheological fluids, and electro-rheological fluids [8], etc. 
MR fluid consists of micron-sized, magnetically polarizable particles dispersed in silicone oil

By Eq. (16)-(18), we can derive that

If sufficient basis functions are used such that function approximation error 0≈ε , then Eq. (19) 
becomes

From Eq. (20) we can easily find that the system is uniformly stable and s , B~, w~ ∞∈L . By Eq. 
(13) we can have . To acquire the asymptotical stability, we need to prove that . It 
can be proved by Eq. (21)
