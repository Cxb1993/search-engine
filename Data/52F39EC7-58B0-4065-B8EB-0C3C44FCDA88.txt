一、中文摘要
浮閘記憶體因具有資料不會隨著電源的
中斷而流失的非揮發特性，因此近來已廣泛地
運用於可攜帶電子產品內成為記憶體的主
流。為了確保浮閘記憶體的非揮發特性，穿隧
氧化層的厚度必須維持 7 nm 以上避免所儲存
的電荷透過穿隧氧化層中的缺陷而流失，但是
這也付出了「寫」與「抹拭」速度慢的代價。
雖然可藉由分散獨立的奈米晶體取代連續的
浮閘來降低穿隧氧化層的厚度進而提昇「寫」
與「抹拭」的速度，但是也因氧化層很薄(1.5~3
nm) 而衍生了電荷保存時間相對短 (short
retention time)的問題。因此如何能在速度與
retention time 之間取得雙贏，一直是科學界努
力的標的。
浮閘電晶體中的奈米晶體如果能做成奈
米量子點 (<5 nm)而且彼此的間距大於 5
nm(面密度約在 1011~1012 cm-2)，單電子效應
在室溫下將會明顯地出現。在愈小的量子點
內，量子能階的分立愈明顯，如此不僅能提供
更好的電荷侷限，相對的所需的庫倫充電能量
也愈高，這意涵著量子點電晶體有較佳的電子
數目掌控能力與較長的電荷保存時間之潛
能。然而以目前的製程技術(電子束微影技術
或磊晶)並不易於製作大小均勻且再現性高的
奈米量子點(<5 nm)。因此在本計畫中，我們利
用矽鍺合金在高溫氧化環境中之氧化速率不
同，而且鍺原子將自氧化物中釋放出來並埋藏
於氧化物與矽鍺合金之介面的特性，來製造原
子尺寸大小的鍺量子點。如此所形成的鍺量子
點之大小取決於鍺原子的釋放與彼此間的聚
集，因此可突破目前一般奈米量子點製作技術
中微影與蝕刻技術的瓶頸。另外相較於同樣大
小的矽量子點，鍺量子點因有較小的能隙與較
輕的載子等效質量，因此可提供較佳的載子侷
限與較大的分立能階。這些特性對於提昇奈米
量子點電晶體的 retention time 及降低穿隧電
流而言是非常重要的。最甚的是這種製程方法
完全合乎目前的 CMOS 元件的製程技術，與
未來的 ULSI 積體電路發展的導向是相符合
的。
本計劃的研究重點，主要著重於研究鍺量
子點與奈米量子點電晶體的製作及元件特
性，如：以選擇性氧化技術來形成鍺奈米量子
點，進而製作奈米量子點電晶體；探討元件基
礎物理並設計奈米量子點電晶體元件結構及
製程最佳化，以提昇奈米量子點電晶體之操作
速度與電荷保存時間。並嘗試利用穿透式電子
顯微鏡與 x射線繞射等方法系統性來分析與歸
納各個製程參數對量子點結構、大小與分佈之
影響，從而建立穩定形成奈米鍺量子點的最佳
化製程條件與研究鍺奈米量子點電晶體充/放
電的物理機制及衰退特性。
英文摘要
In this project, we have successfully
developed a simple method to form 5-8 nm Ge
nanocrystals by selective oxidation of poly-SiGe.
We found that the size and density of Ge QDs
and larger energy level separations would be
achieved for their lower energy bandgap and
smaller smaler carier’s efective mass as 
compared to their counterpart Si QDs with the
same size. It is reasonable to expect that Ge nc
memory devices would provide better solutions
for the trade-off between speed and retention
time. In the past, Ge-ncs embedded in SiO2
matrices have been demonstrated by cosputtering
or direct deposition of Ge-film on SiO2 followed
by subsequent oxidation [3, 4] for optoelectronic
devices application. In this paper, we report a
simple and CMOS compatible method for
forming Ge QDs using selective oxidation of
polycrystalline SiGe and demonstrate significant
memory effects in the Ge-nc
metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitors (MOS-Cs)
and field effect transistors (MOSFETs). It is
known that Si will be preferentially oxidized
during high-temperature oxidation of SiGe alloy
while the segregated Ge atoms remain in their
elemental form and would precipitate at the
SiGe/SiO2 interface. Therefore, not only Ge QDs
would be naturally formed due to Ge atom
segregation and agglomeration but also they are
embedded between the growing (upper) and
buried (lower) oxides [5] once a
SiGe-on-insulator structure is completely
thermal oxidized.
三、研究方法及成果
The fabrication of Ge-ncs MOS devices
starts from growing a 4 nm tunneling oxide in O2
ambient at 900 oC on 0.09-0.7 -cm <100>
n-type 4”Si wafers. Next, a 5 nm amorphous Si
buffer layer and an averaged 21.3 nm
hemispherical polycrystalline Si0.88Ge0.12 grains
were deposited at 580 oC using SiH4 and GeH4
as precursors with the flow rates of 256 sccm and
16 sccm, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The
Ge mole fraction of the polycrystalline SiGe is
determined by x-ray diffraction. To prevent Ge
atoms get vaporized during the following high
temperature oxidation process, a 5 nm tetraethyl
orthosilicate (TEOS) oxide was deposited at 690
oC as a cap layer. Subsequently, thermal
oxidation is performed at 900 oC in H2/O2
ambient to completely oxidize the amorphous
Si/poly-Si0.88Ge0.12 and followed by O2 anneal
for 10 min at 900 oC. This would induce Ge QDs
confined by the growing (control) oxide and the
buried (tunneling) oxide due to Ge atoms
segregation and agglomeration. Then, a 200 nm
undoped polycrystalline Si film was deposited
and patterned as gate electrodes. After gate
definition, arsenic (20 KeV, 5x1015 cm-2) was
implanted to dope gate and source/drain and then
activated by rapid thermal anneal at 900 oC for
20 seconds. Finally, passivation, contact-hole
definition, metallization, and 400 oC forming gas
sintering steps were performed to complete
device fabrication (Fig. 1(d)).

windows of 3.52 V and 1.92 V, respectively, are
observed from the MOS-Cs having Ge-ncs with
and without subsequent O2 anneal, which implies
that charges are stored within Ge-ncs or interface
traps. The slopes of the C-V curves for MOS-Cs
with Ge-ncs are almost unchanged before and
after charge injection, indicating that charge
storage is not directly related to the interface
traps. After electron injection, the positive Vfb
shift (∆Vfb) for MOS-Cs having Ge-ncs with and
without O2 anneal is 2.2 V and 1.8 V,
respectively. Assuming a single electron storage
per nanocrystal, the nc density estimated from
the corresponding ∆Vfb is 2.51012 cm-2 and
3.11012 cm-2 for Ge-ncs formed by oxidation
without and with O2 anneal, respectively. These
values are larger than what we observed from
TEM. This is probably that the ncs are not made
small enough to exhibit strong Coulomb
blockade effects and to limit additional injection
of carriers into the ncs. However, larger amount
of charges are stored in the Ge-ncs formed with
O2 anneal might be ascribed to denser Ge-ncs
formed during O2 anneal process since more
thermal energy is provided for Ge atoms to
diffuse and agglomerate.
3.3. Current-voltage Characteristics of Ge-ncs
MOSFETs
Figure 3 plots the current-voltage characteristics
of Ge-ncs MOSFETs (W/L = 10 m/1 m)
programmed at 3 or 5 V for 30 sec. As the
MOSFETs are programmed at 5 V, significant
threshold voltage shift of 2.6 V or 2.2 V is
observed for those with Ge-ncs formed by
thermal oxidation with and without O2 anneal. A
reduced subthreshold slope, a lower off-state
leakage current, and a larger threshold voltage
shift are observed in the MOSFET with Ge-ncs
formed with additional O2 anneal, which
indicates that a better interface between Ge-ncs
and SiO2 and denser ncs could be obtained by the
additional anneal process. In addition to charge
storage, the retention time is also an important
reliability parameter for practical application in
nonvolatile memories.
