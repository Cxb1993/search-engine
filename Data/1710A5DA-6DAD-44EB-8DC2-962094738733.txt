英 文 摘 要 ： The melt crystallization process of two classical 
crystallized polymer 
(polyethylene and syndiotactic polystyrene) is to be 
examined by means of TEM and 
AFM for this study. There are considerable amount of 
nanograins formed at the 
beginning, and they can be mainly divided into two 
categories, which are the disc-like 
ones and the tower-like ones. The polymer chains of 
the disc-like ones would be 
perpendicular or parallel to the sample surface, with 
height of less than 20 nm. 
However, these nanograins might coalesce at the 
initial phase of crystallization 
because of a high density of nucleation, resulting in 
the polymer chains＇ random 
arrangement of worm-like nanograins. The entire 
polymer chains of the tower-like 
nanograins are parallel to the sample surface yet 
developed perpendicularly. There are 
three primary polymer crystallization mechanisms 
having been proposed in the 
literature: 1. A hexagonal mesophase developed from 
the outset of the crystalline 
phase proposed by Stephen Z. D. Cheng and Lotz. 2. 
That a mesomorphic layer being 
absorbed at first, then thickening and turning into a 
constant arranged granular crystal 
layer, finally into homogeneous lamellar crystallines 
proposed by Strobl. 3. That the 
lamellar were coalesced by nanograins proposed by 
Jeng U. et al. However, based on 
our experiments, nanograins would be melting into a 
state of fusion and connecting 
each other at the early stage of melt crystallization 
instead of growing and coalescing 
into lamellae. We found that here were great amount 
of nanograins formation at the 
initial stage, the nanograins then coalesced and 
melted into the fusion mesophase 
Investigation of Polymer Crystallization Mechanism at the Early Stage 
 
Introduction 
1. Lauritzen-Hoffman theory 
The Lauritzen-Hoffman theory of the formation of polymer crystals with folded chains, 
set forth four decades age(1,2,3), owes its origin to the discovery in 1957(4,5,6) that 
characteristically thin single crystals of polyethylene can be grown from dilute solution. As 
first proposed by Keller of the University of Bristol (UK) in his seminal paper(5), the long 
polymer chain are more or less regularly folded between the upper and lower lamella surfaces 
with the chain stems between successive folds oriented preferentially normal to the plane of 
the lamellae. Chain folding was an essential feature of the crystallization of polymer from the 
molten state. In the latter case, polymers were found to undergo spherulitic crystallization, but 
the spherulites were composed of radiating structural units that were found to be lamellar and 
bore a kinship to solution grown crystals. In short, following the events of 1957, it was 
evident that a theory was needed to explain the then startling occurrence of chain folding and 
its general effects on polymer crystallization.  
In 1961 and 1962, Hoffman and Lauritzen presented their theory for the formation of 
chain-folded crystals based on surface nucleation concepts. Hoffman and Lauritzen 
established the foundation of the kinetic theory of polymer crystallization from solution(1) and 
from the melt(2), Definite predictions were given under certain assumptions concerning the 
experimentally observed variation in lamellar thickness with crystallization temperature, the 
metastability and the melting point of lamellae, and the temperature dependence of the 
kinetics of crystallization rate. As the theory was extended, it began to receive attention and 
experimental support at NBS and elsewhere. In 1971, Hoffman and Lauritzen were awarded 
the High Polymer Physics Prize of the American Physical Society. The citation read in part 
“for their Kinetic Theory of Polymer Crystallization.” 
 
2. New Mechanisms of Recrystallization by Strobl 
Strobl(7) interpreted the grown of polymer crystal by way of the studies on 
micro-observation(8-12), scattering(13-17) and analysis of spectrum(18) and thermodynamic(19) is 
dissimilar to single-stem surface nucleation from the Lauritzen-Hoffman theory. The new 
mechanism of recrystallization after melting in semicrystalline polymer is mesomerphic and 
granular crystalline layers to lamellar crystallites. Strobl propose for the growth of the 
lamellar crystallites in an entangled polymer melt a mechanism as sketched in Figure 1.1(7). It 
schematically indicates the sequence of states which are passed through in the transformation 
of the melt into the final lamellar crystallite, as they would show up consecutively along a 
layer in a snapshot. 
The process starts with the attachment of chain sequences from the melt onto the lateral 
growth face of a layer with a mesomorphic inner structure. The layer is composed of stretched 
Experimental section 
1. material 
The sPS sample with weight-average molecular mass of 140 kDa, polydispersity of 2.4, 
and high stereoregularity (>98% in regioregular triad content as determined from 13C nuclear 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy) was obtained from Grand Pacific Petrochemical and was 
purified via precipitation of hot xylene solution into a large excess of methanol. The sample 
was supplied to us by Professor J.C. Tsai at the National Chung Cheng University.  
 
2. TEM 
Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) studies were performed using a JEOL 
JEM-1400 instrument under an acceleration voltage of 120 kV (wavelength ?). Solution of 
sPS homopolymer in xylene (ca. 0.4% for TEM specimens) prepared by warming in a hot 
water bath up to 80-90 oC were used for drop casting of film specimens on carbon-coated 
glass substrate. The sPS sample was heated up to 300 oC for 5min to eliminate previous 
thermal history under a stream of flowing nitrogen with a heating rate of 100 oC/min, and 
cooled at 50 oC/min to the different crystallization temperatures. Keep the crystallization 
temperatures in a crystallization time for crystallization ample. Then, the film were quenched 
into ice water remain the high temperature phase. Final, these specimens were floated off the 
substrate using aqueous HF solution, washed in de-ionized water, vacuum dried, followed by 
evaporation coating with combination of Pt/C under vacuum.  
 
3. SAXS 
In-situ SAXS/WAXS/DSC measurements of sPS specimen were performed at the 
BL17B3 beamline of the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC). The 
sample was sealed in a common Al case for DSC, modified with two Kapton windows of 4 
mm diameter for X-rays. The sample cell was then placed in the DSC cell holder of Mettler 
Toledo FP84, which was specially modified for simultaneous SAXS/WAXS/DSC 
measurement, as detailed in our previous report. With an 8 keV beam of 0.5 mm dia., 
sample-to-detector distances of 2700 mm (SAXS) and 750 mm (WAXS), and a beam stop of 
6 mm dia., SAXS, WAXS, and DSC data were simultaneously collected using the 2-D and 
1-D multiwire proportional counters and the DSC instrument, during a heating process from 
30 - 300 °C (at a heating rate of 10 oC/min). With the available photon flux of ~109 photons/s 
at 8 keV, the SAXS/WAXS data collection time was set to 1 frame/minute for the whole 
heating and annealing process. All the SAXS and WAXS data were corrected for 
sample transmission, background, and detector sensitivity. The scattering vector defined by Q 
= 4πλ-1 sin(θ), with λ and 2θ for the X-ray wavelength and scattering angle, was calibrated by 
using silver behenate for SAXS and sodalite and Si powders for WAXS. A polyethylene 
sample was used in placing all the measured SAXS data on the absolute intensity scale, I(Q). 
3.7(c) and (d)). The coalescence process of tower-like nanograins is relatively slow than that 
of disc-like nanograins. Therefore, the individual tower-like nanograins frequently located in 
the grain boundaries of flat-on lamellae (Figure 3.8). In Figure 8(a) the greater part of 
nanograins outside the flat-on lamellae melted into liquid state and became flatten. These 
melts would develop into that part of flat-on lamellae by coalescence and solidification. 
The multi-layer lamellae also can be constructed by coalescence of disc-like nanograins 
on the surface of flat-on lamellae. The nanograins aggregated into the faceting shape prior the 
coalescence (Figure 3.9(a)). These faceting aggregations implied the expitaxy relationship 
within the substrate and the top nanograins. Figure 3.9(b) shows the second layer flat-on 
lamellae grown on the surface of flat-on lamellae by coalescence of disc-like nanograin 
aggregates. In Figure 3.10 (a) the nanograins aligned co-linear and coalesced into edge-on 
lamellae. The nanograins coalescence processes would lead to the muti-layer lamellae (Figure 
3.11). 
By means of TEM investigation, we proposed that the crystallization mechanism can be 
distinguished three steps: formation of the nanograins at first; these nanograins grew up and 
adjusted the chain orientation via melting; the solidification of coherent chain results in the 
lamellae. This coalescence of nanograins crystallization mechanism is different from the 
stems attach model proposed by Lauritzen-Hoffman and the formation of a mesophase in the 
growth front proposed by Strobl.

2. SAXS studies on cold crystallization 
During the temperature change from 140 to 230 oC, the SAXS profiles measured 
display a continuous shift of the interference peak from Qc = 0.054 A-1 to 0.041 A-1 in the 
Figure 1, revealing that the mean spacing of the nanograin expand from 8.4 nm(140 oC), 9.8 
nm(160 oC), 10.7 nm(180 oC), 11.8 nm(200 oC), 12.6 nm(210 oC), 13.5 nm(220 oC), 13.6 
nm(230 oC), whereas the increasing peak intensity with the increase of temperature indicates a 
continuous growth of the nanograin size. The concomitant increases of the mean spacing and 
grain size, at the condition that both dimensions are comparable, can be reconciled by 
coalescence of the nanograins. Based on the observed peak intensities, we would expect that 
the volume of the nanograins is increased by three folds when temperature is raised from 140 
oC to 230 oC. Using the same ellipsoid form factor together with the S(Q) from the MSA 
model, we have also fitted the SAXS profiles with the grain thickness and diameter values 
and Rg value for the nanograins at the 140 oC to 230 oC. The result suggests that the sPS 
nanograins develop into an oblate shape, in an attempt to form large sheet-like crystallization 
domains.  
We summarize the structural evolution extracted from the SAXS for the sample in 
Figure 2 where the Rg is radius gyration of the grain, Q-invariant is overall scattering power 
that was defined the change of electron density, mean spacing is the distance between grains, 
which can be characterized by the incubation stage, nucleation stage, and coalescence stage. 
In the incubation stage before 120 oC there is little change in morphology. In the nucleation 
stage between 120 oC and 140 oC, spherical nanograins increase in number, with a constant 
size and shape. In the coalescence stage after 140 oC, the nanograins grow by coalescence, 
resulting a rapid increase in size. Such coalescence of ordered nanograins does not lead to a 
significant change in the degree of phase separation, as evidenced by the nearly constant Qinv 
in the stage.  
In the result of the SAXS fitting model, we observed the crystallization mechanism of 
sPS is similar with the TEM bright images, the nanograins grow by coalescence.
