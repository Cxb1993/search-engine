具非平衡信任之量子秘密分享協定之研究 
 
壹、前言 
現今的資訊安全技術基本上都是植基於密碼學相關理論所發展出來的，例
如：DES、AES、RSA、ElGamal 密碼系統等等，其安全性屬於計算安全，亦即
在於讓破密者在一定時間內無法破解這些密碼系統，所以此類密碼系統並不是永
久安全的。隨著量子電腦的發展，一些基於數學難題的密碼系統，例如 RSA(基
於因式分解數學難題)，已經被證實可以在多項式的時間內被量子電腦破解(Shor
演算法)[24]。因此在傳統密碼學中，許多基於解數學難題的密碼系統，未來可能
變的不安全而無法使用，所幸的是，量子電腦除了用來破解傳統密碼系統之外，
我們亦可以利用量子電腦來發展出建構在量子物理上的密碼系統。 
量子密碼學(Quantum Cryptography)[19]為近代重要的研究領域之一，主要是
根據量子物理的法則[25][26]，例如：海森堡測不準原理、不可複製性[27]等，所
發展出來的一門科學，其安全性係架構於量子物理特性[25][26]上；量子密碼的
基本特徵有兩點，一是無條件安全，另一則是竊聽可檢測性。所謂的無條件安全
指的是，破密者在具有無限資源的條件下仍無法破解該密碼系統；而竊聽可檢測
性指的是，通訊的雙方可以根據量測不確定性來檢測出通信過程是否遭到竊聽。 
量子金鑰分配協定(Quantum Key Distribution Protocol)[23]是目前量子密碼
學中重要的研究課題之一，其目的在於讓通訊的雙方利用量子的傳輸來建立一把
共享的金鑰，之後再利用此金鑰來進行訊息的溝通，而為了確認量子傳輸過程的
安全，通訊的雙方可利用公開討論(public discussion)的機制，藉量子物理的特性
可檢測出是否有竊聽者的存在。 
量子秘密分享協定(Quantum Secret Sharing Protocol)[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] 
[9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16]同樣為量子密碼學研究領域中最重要的研究議題
之一。秘密分享之目的在於將一個秘密訊息分割成數個次密鑰(shadows)。每一
個次密鑰都不能單獨地復原此秘密訊息，但是當有足夠的次密鑰時，則可以做
到。以一個簡單的例子來看，在三方的量子秘密分享中，老闆將他的秘密訊息分
成兩個次密鑰，然後分別分給他的兩個代理人，任何一個代理人都不能單獨的復
原老闆的秘密訊息，只有當他們合作時，老闆的秘密訊息才能被還原回來。基本
上，目前文獻上所發表的量子秘密分享協定，都是基於平等信任(balanced trust)
原則，亦即秘密分享者對每個代理人的信任程度都是相等的，所以每個代理人所
握有的部分資訊都是一樣多的。然而在現實的環境中，公司或組織中均存在非平
衡信任(unbalanced trust)的問題，例如：公司的老闆將秘密訊息分給兩個代理人，
一個代理人的職位為主管，另一個代理人的職位為員工，在此環境下一定存在著
非平衡信任的關係，即公司老闆對主管的信賴程度通常會比員工還來得高，所以
老闆可將較多的部分資訊給主管，讓握有較少部分資訊的員工，如果想自己一個
人竊取到秘密資訊更加困難，在此類應用環境下，平等信任的量子秘密分享協定
並不適合，因此，如何發展具非平衡信任特性的量子秘密分享協定，便有其重要
性與實用性。本計畫之研究即是提出一種非平衡信任之量子秘密分享協定，亦即
秘密分享者可根據代理人不同之權利、階級和信賴度，來分配次密鑰的數量，擁
有越高權利、階級和信賴度的代理人，將擁有更多的次密鑰數量，因此能夠自己
就解得秘密分享者一半的資訊，另一半的秘密訊息則必須跟其他代理人合作才能
取得。

如果第三顆光子的量測結果是 1 ，則根據上面的式子可以看出，第一顆和第二
顆貝爾量測出來的結果將會是不確定的。以下將簡單的描述 Xue 等人的量子秘
密分享協定(圖 3-1)。 
Alice 產生 n 個 W state，她將這些 W state 分成三個序列， AS ， BS 和 CS ， AS
代表每一個 W state 的第一顆光子， BS 代表每一個 W state 的第二顆光子， CS 代
表每一個W state的第三顆光子。Alice做上四個 unitary operation的其中一個到 AS
上的每顆光子上，然後她藉由量子通道將 AS 和 BS 送給 Bob， CS 送給 Charlie。 
Bob 和 Charlie 收到這些光子之後，他們個別回送一個 OK 給 Alice。 
為了要檢測有沒有竊聽者的存在，他們將執行公開討論(public discussion)。
如果公開討論失敗的話，他們就重新開始這個協定。 
在公開討論之後，Bob 和 Charlie 就可以根據他們的量測結果來重新復原
Alice 的秘密訊息。即，Bob 使用貝爾基底去量測他的光子，Charlie 使用 R 基底
去量測她的光子，基於 W state 的 dense coding，他們兩個就可以合作去解出 Alice
的秘密。

在 Xue 等人的量子秘密分享的協定中，Alice 使用 W state 的 dense coding 來
編碼她的秘密金鑰，Bob 和 Charlie 藉由他們的量測結果來解回 Alice 的秘密金
鑰。從面的協定中可以發現，他們的協定是屬於非平衡信任的量子秘密分享協
定，Bob 所握有的資訊量比 Charlie 還要多。然而 Xue 等人的協定存在一個小小
的缺點，在他們的協定中，n-bit 的秘密訊息，最後只有 2
3
n  的 bits 可以被 Bob

除了使用上述的量測方法外，GHZ state 也可以使用 GHZ 基底來進行量

子來說，如果所準備的 GHZ state 是 1 ，則 GHZ 量測出來的結果也
將會是 1 。因此，我們可以將 000、001、010、011、100、101、110、
111 分別編碼到 1 、 2 、 3 、 4 、 5 、 6 、 7 和 8 這
八個 GHZ state 上(表 4-2)。

根據上面的描述，很明顯的每一個 GHZ state 可以解出兩個 bits 的資
訊，舉個例子來看，如果 Bob 的量測結果是  ，Charlie 的量測結果是
 ，則他們就可以知道 Alice 所準備的 GHZ state 是屬於 1 3  這個
群，因此就可以解出 Alice 的秘密訊息 00。在所提出的非平衡信任的量子
秘密分享協定，Charlie 有四分之一的機率猜到 Alice 的正確訊息，Bob 有
二分之一的機率猜到 Alice 的正確訊息。此外本研究計畫所提出來的協定
可以百分之百的還原 Alice 的秘密訊息。即，如果 Alice 有 2n-bit 的秘密
訊息想分享，他只需要準備 n 個 GHZ states。透過此提出的協定，Bob 和
Charlie 可以復原所有 2n-bit 的秘密。 
 
(二)作法二： 
接下來是本研究計畫所提出第二個非平衡信任的量子秘密分享協定
研究成果。藉由使用先前章節所提到的方法二，我們提出了另一個確定式
的非平衡信任的量子秘密分享協定(圖 4-2)。假設 Alice 是秘密的分享者，
Bob 和 Charlie 分別是 Alice 的兩個代理人(Agent)，他們事先先決定八個
GHZ states 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7  和 8 ，分別
編碼成三個傳統的位元值，000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110 和 111 (表 
4-2)。

訊，舉個例子來看，如果 Bob 和 Charlie 的 GHZ 量測結果是 1 ，則他
們就可以知道 Alice 所準備的 GHZ state 是 1 ，因此就可以解出 Alice
的秘密訊息 000。在所提出的非平衡信任的量子秘密分享協定，如果 Bob
和 Charlie 沒有一起合作去執行 GHZ 量測，則 Charlie 有八分之一的機率
猜到 Alice 的正確訊息，Bob 有四分之一的機率猜到 Alice 的正確訊息。
此外本研究計畫所提出來的協定可以百分之百的還原 Alice 的秘密訊息。
即，如果 Alice 有 3n-bit 的秘密訊息想分享，他只需要準備 n 個 GHZ 
states。透過此提出的協定，Bob 和 Charlie 可以復原所有 3n-bit 的秘密。 
 
三、協定之安全分析 
針對本計畫所提出的兩個具非平衡信任的量子秘密分享協定進行安全
性分析如下：在本計畫所提出的協定中，其安全性皆基於公開討論(public 
discussion)和偽冒光子(decoy photon)的安插位置。利用這兩個機制來偵測是
否有竊聽者的存在。此檢測方式跟 Zhou 等人的量子秘密分享協定[12]和
Chen 等人的量子秘密分享協定[14]一樣，在不知道偽冒光子的極化狀態
(polarization states)和這些光子的安插位置情況下，隨機去量測這些偽冒光子
通過公開討論(public discussion)的機率是四分之三(此機率跟BB84協定裡的
檢測率一樣[23])，因此對 n 個偽冒光子而言，竊聽者全部都通過的機率將會
是 3
4
n    。當 n 夠大的時候，竊聽者在公開討論(public discussion)被檢測出來
的機率將趨近於 1。因此藉由此檢測機制，我們可以確定所提出的兩個協
定，他們的光子傳輸是安全且可以偵測到竊聽者的。 
 
伍、結論與建議 
一、結論 
本計畫提出了具非平衡信任量子秘密分享協定的兩種作法。第一種作
法使用 GHZ state 和貝爾量測(Bell measurement)的方法來實現；在此協
定中，秘密的分享者 Alice，將比較多的秘密資訊分送給比較多權限或較
高職位的代理人 Bob；此外我們所提出的協定是可以百分之百的還原
Alice 的秘密訊息，而非像 Xue 等人的協定是機率式的。換句話說，如果
Alice 有 2n-bit 的秘密想分享的話，Bob 和 Charlie 透過此協定可以還原
全部 2n-bit 的秘密訊息。在光子傳輸的安全上，為了檢測是否存在竊聽
者，我們使用了偽冒光子的檢測機制，來確保光子傳輸上的安全。值得注
意的是，在我們所提出的具非平衡信任量子秘密分享協定，較高職位或較
多權限者 Bob，可以獨自還原 Alice 一半的秘密訊息。而另外一半的秘密
訊息則必須要有另外一位較低權限者 Charlie 的幫助之下才能還原回
來，所以此協定也可以把它看成 Alice 分享一把秘密金鑰給 Bob，並且和
Bob 跟 Charlie 分享一個秘密訊息，也就是量子金鑰協定(QKD)和量子秘
密分享協定的組合。 
本計畫所提出具非平衡信任量子秘密分享協定的第二種作法使用了
GHZ state 和 GHZ 量測的方法來實現，跟第一個提出的協定一樣，Alice
將較多的秘密資訊分享給 Bob，而且此協定一樣可以達到百分之百的還
原，屬於確定而非機率式的。更進一步，我們將每一對 GHZ state 可提供

Abstract
Gao (2009 Commun. Theor. Phys. 52 421–4) has proposed an efficient multiparty quantum
secret sharing (MQSS) with two-photon three-dimensional Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR)
pairs. This work shows that a similar idea can also be used to construct an MQSS using the
Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) states. Compared to other MQSSs using GHZ-related
states, the newly proposed protocol is more efficient in the aspect of qubit utilization.
PACS numbers: 03.67.Dd, 03.67.Hk.

1. Introduction
Since the rapid development of quantum information
science, quantum secure communication, which combines
quantum mechanics and classical communication to achieve
unconditional security, has become one of the most important
research areas of quantum information. Among all research
areas of quantum secure communications, quantum secret
sharing (QSS) is attracting more and more attention. A
QSS protocol combines quantum mechanics and the idea
of secret sharing to split secret information into several
shadows. Each shadow alone cannot recover the secret, but
a specific quantity of shadows can. As an example, in a
three-party QSS protocol, the boss (say Alice) splits her secret
into two shadows and then sends one to each of her two
agents (say Bob and Charlie) respectively. Each agent alone
cannot recover Alice’s secret. Only when they collaborate,
can Alice’s secret be recovered. Therefore, Alice’s secret can
be protected from being revealed by a potentially dishonest
agent alone.
In a multiparty QSS (MQSS) protocol, the boss splits her
secret into many shadows (more than two) and then sends one
to each agent. Each agent alone cannot recover Alice’s secret.
Only when enough agents collaborate, can Alice’s secret be
recovered.
Many QSS protocols have been proposed with
different quantum states, including single photons [2–5],
Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) pairs [6–14] and
Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) states [15, 16]. In 1999,
Hillery et al [15] utilized entangled three-photon GHZ states
to propose the first QSS protocol, namely the HBB99 scheme.
In their scheme, Alice prepares a three-photon quantum
system in the GHZ state |ψ〉 = 1√
2
(|000〉+ |111〉)ABC and
sends the photons B and C to Bob and Charlie, respectively.
The three parties all choose randomly one of the two
measuring bases to measure the photons in their hands
independently. They keep the correlated results for generating
the key KA. In the HBB99 scheme, each GHZ state carries
one-bit classical information. Furthermore, about half
the GHZ states generated by Alice will be abandoned
because of the uncorrelated measuring bases, and half the
remainder of the GHZ states will be used for the eavesdropper
checking. Thus, the qubit efficiency of the HBB99 scheme is
1
3 × 14 = 112 , which means that 12 photons may generate one
classical bit key.
In 2006, Deng et al [16] used the dense coding of the
GHZ state to modify the HBB99 scheme. In the Deng et al
QSS scheme, each GHZ state can carry two-bit classical
information. However, the probability that the measuring
results can be used to generate the key is 14 for each
communication round. Therefore, the qubit efficiency of the
Deng et al QSS scheme is 23 × 14 = 16 , which means that six
qubits may generate one classical bit key.

and single-photon detectors [20]. After Bob confirms
that the received photons are the single photons,
he performs one of the four unitary operations
{I, σz, σx , iσy} on each photon in S1 and randomly
inserts l decoy single photons into S1 to form S
′
1. Then
he sends S ′1 to Charlie.
Step 3. Upon receiving S ′1 sent by Bob, in order to check the
existence of eavesdropping, Bob and Charlie use the
decoy single photons to perform public discussions. If
there is no eavesdropper, they continue the protocol;
otherwise, they abort the communication.
Step 4. Alice encodes her secret by performing one of
the four unitary operations {I, σz, σx , iσy} on each
photon in S2 and randomly inserts l decoy single
photons into S2 and S3 to form S
′
2 and S
′
3. Then, she
sends S ′2 and S
′
3 to Charlie.
Step 5. After confirming that Charlie has received S ′2 and S
′
3,
Alice announces the positions of the decoy single
photons and then they use these photons for the
eavesdropping check. If there is no eavesdropper,
they continue the protocol; otherwise, they abort the
communication.
Step 6. After the public discussion, Charlie carried out GHZ
measurement to obtain MRC. By comparing the initial
GHZ state |91〉, Bob’s unitary operations UB and
Charlie’s measuring result MRC, Bob and Charlie can
collaborate to obtain Alice’s secret UA.
In the proposed protocol, Alice uses one of the four unitary
operations {I, σz, σx , iσy} to encode her secret. Bob uses his
unitary operations UB and Charlie uses his measuring results
MRC to derive Alice’s secret UA together. To check whether
S1, S2 and S3 are transmitted securely or not, the decoy single
photons are applied.
It is also straightforward to generalize the protocol to
the case of multiple parties, i.e. (Bob, Bob1, Bob2, . . .,
Bobm and Charlie). In the multiparty case, step 2 has to be
repeated for Bob1, . . ., Bobm who perform unitary operations
on the photons, respectively, and the processed photons are
transmitted from Bob to Bob1 . . . until Bobm sequentially.
At last, photons are sent from Bobm to Charlie. Then, Alice
performs step 4 to encode her secret and sends her photons to
the final agent, Charlie. After that, Alice and Charlie perform
step 5 for an eavesdropping check. When step 6 is finished, the
MQSS protocol can be accomplished. Bob, Bob1, . . . , Bobm
and Charlie can work together to recover Alice’s secret then.
2.3. Security analysis
In this section, the security of the proposed protocol is
discussed. Essentially, the security of the proposed protocol
is based on the public discussion on the inserted decoy single
photons. In the following, we analyze the intercept-and-resend
attack, the entanglement-and-measure attack and the security
under a noisy quantum channel, against the proposed protocol.
1. Intercept-and-resend attack. In order to check whether
S1 is transmitted securely or not, Bob randomly inserts
l decoy single photons to S1. The eavesdropper may
try to measure and then resend the quantum sequence
in the hope of passing the checking process of public
discussion. Without knowing the polarization states, the
probability for a random guess on a decoy single photon
to pass the public discussion is 34 (the same as in the
BB84 protocol [21]). Therefore, the probability that an
eavesdropper, Eve, passes the public discussion is ( 34 )
l
,
where l is the number of decoy single photons. While
l is large enough, the probability that Eve passes the
eavesdropping detection in the public discussion is very
small. It is the same for S2 and S3. Therefore, S1, S2 and
S3 can be transmitted securely due to the utilization of
decoy single photons.
2. Entangle-and-measure [22]. A dishonest agent, say Bob,
may try to recover the dealer’s secret without the help
of the other agent, Charlie. Since he does not know
the positions and states of the decoy photons in the
intercepted Charlie’s sequence, S ′2 and S
′
3, Bob then
prepares some ancillas E = {|E1〉, |E2〉, . . . , |Em〉} and
entangles these ancillas with S ′2 and S
′
3 by performing
a unitary operation Uˆ (explained later) in the hope that
he can pass the eavesdropping check between Alice and
Charlie and also derive useful information about Charlie’s
shadow. However, the effect of Bob’s operation on the
decoy photons will produce the following results:
Uˆ · |0〉|Ei 〉 = α|0〉|e00〉+β|1〉|e01〉, (1)
Uˆ · |1〉|Ei 〉 = γ |0〉|e10〉+ δ|1〉|e11〉, (2)
Uˆ · |+〉|Ei 〉 = 12 (|+〉(α|e00〉+β|e01〉+ γ |e10〉+ δ|e11〉).
+ |−〉(α|e00〉−β|e01〉+ γ |e10〉− δ|e11〉)),
(3)
Uˆ · |−〉|Ei 〉 = 12 (|+〉(α|e00〉+β|e01〉− γ |e10〉− δ|e11〉).
+ |−〉(α|e00〉−β|e01〉− γ |e10〉+ δ|e11〉),
(4)
where Uˆ · Uˆ † = Uˆ † · Uˆ = I ; |Ei 〉 is the initial state of
Bob’s ancilla; |e00〉, |e01〉, |e10〉 and |e11〉 are the four
states that can be distinguished by Bob and |α2|+ |β2| =
|γ 2|+ |δ2| = 1. In order to pass the eavesdropping check,
Bob has to set β = γ = 0, if Alice’s decoy photons are
|0〉 or |1〉. Similarly, Bob has to set α|e00〉−β|e01〉+
γ |e10〉− δ|e11〉 = α|e00〉+β|e01〉− γ |e10〉− δ|e11〉 = E0, if
Alice’s decoy photons are |+〉 or |−〉, where E0 denotes
a zero vector. In this situation, Bob’s attack will not
be detected in the public discussion between Alice and
Charlie. However, if β = γ = 0, then α|e00〉− δ|e11〉 = E0.
And it implies α|e00〉 = δ|e11〉. In this case, Bob is unable
to distinguish α|e00〉 from δ|e11〉 and thus he cannot
measure these ancillas to obtain useful information about
Charlie’s shadow. On the contrary, if Bob wants to make
the ancillas distinguishable (i.e. to make α|e00〉 6= δ|e11〉)
to obtain Charlie’s shadow, then he will disturb the states
of the decoy photons and end up being detected in the
public discussion between Alice and Charlie.

Bob nor Charlie can individually recover the secret message, but they can work together to
do so. Many QSS protocols [3–19] have since been proposed with various quantum states
and quantum mechanics. For instances, Karlsson, Koashi and Imoto [4] proposed one QSS
scheme by using Bell state in 1999; Xiao et al. modified the HBB99 with multi-photon en-
tangled GHZ state to achieve the property of arbitrary multiparties [5], and Li et al. proposed
a QSS protocol with entanglement swapping in [7].
Recently, Deng et al. proposed a multiparty quantum secret sharing (MQSS) protocol [8]
with GHZ states and quantum dense coding [20]. In their MQSS protocol, each GHZ state
can carry two bits of information and the agents need not announce the measuring bases
for the photons except those for eavesdropping checks. The agents exploit the four local
unitary operations I , σz, σx and iσy to encode their messages and take some single-photon
measurements on the photons received from Alice to check eavesdroppers.
Basically, most of GHZ states generated by Alice are used for eavesdropping check rather
than sharing Alice’s secret message in Deng et al.’s MQSS protocol. The case that a GHZ
state is used to share Alice’s secret occurs when all agents take the received photon as the
message-coding mode. The probability of this to happen is 12N , where N is the number of
agents. Accordingly, with the probability of (1− 12N ), the GHZ state would be consumed for
the eavesdropping check. In addition, Alice needs to exchange classical information with
agents to know their selection of the modes for every photon transmission. This classical
communication would be costly, too. In this study, it is found that the performance of Deng
et al.’s protocol can be much improved by using the techniques of block-transmission [21]
and decoy single photons [22, 23]. Furthermore, the modified protocol can use all of GHZ
states to encode Alice’s secret and only one public discussion between each agent and the
dealer is required for eavesdropping check.
The remainder of this study is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the property
of GHZ state and Deng et al.’s MQSS protocol. Section 3 brings the techniques of block-
transmission and decoy single photons to Deng et al.’s MQSS protocol and analyzes the
efficiency and security of this modification. Finally, Sect. 4 concludes the results.
2 Review of Deng et al.’s MQSS Protocol
This section briefly reviews the property of GHZ state and Deng et al.’s MQSS protocol. For
three-photon maximally entangled quantum systems, the eight GHZ states can be written as
follows:
|1〉 = 1√
2
(|000〉 + |111〉)BCA,
|2〉 = 1√
2
(|000〉 − |111〉)BCA,
|3〉 = 1√
2
(|001〉 + |110〉)BCA,
|4〉 = 1√
2
(|001〉 − |110〉)BCA,
|5〉 = 1√
2
(|010〉 + |101〉)BCA,

Fig. 1 Deng et al.’s MQSS protocol with four possible modes
UA = UB ⊗UC . Here UB and UC are the operations which are done by Bob and Charlie
based on their raw keys KB and KC , respectively. They repeat the protocol to get enough
key bits KA = KB ⊕ KC .
(4) Alice analyses the error rate of the samples to determine whether there are eavesdrop-
pers monitoring the quantum channel.
(5) If all the error rates are lower than a predetermined threshold, Alice, Bob and Charlie
can distill a private key KA = KB ⊕ KC from the outcomes of the joint GHZ state
measurements with error correction and privacy amplification. Otherwise, they discard
the measurement results and repeat the protocol from the beginning.
Int J Theor Phys (2011) 50:2790–2798 2795
Step 1. Alice generates n GHZ states in |1〉 state. She divides these GHZ states into two
sequences, SB and SC . SB is the set of the first photon of each GHZ state and SC is the
set of the second photon of each GHZ state. Then, she sends SB and SC to Bob and
Charlie, respectively.
Step 2. After Bob receives the photons, based on his raw key, KB , of 2n bits, he performs
one of the four unitary operations {I, σz, σx, iσy} on each photon in SB . Then, Bob
randomly inserts l decoy single photons into SB and sends them back to Alice. Similarly,
based on his raw key, KC , of 2n bits Charlie also carries out the same actions.
Step 3. Upon receiving the photons sent by Bob and Charlie, Alice requests Bob and Char-
lie to announce the positions of decoy single photons, respectively, and then they dis-
cuss the states of decoy photons to check whether any eavesdropper exists in this com-
munication or not. If the error rate exceeds a predetermined threshold, they abort this
communication and restart the protocol.
Step 4. After the public discussion, Alice performs GHZ measurement to get each |y〉.
By comparing the initial GHZ state |1〉 with |y〉, Alice can derive the combined
information KA = KB ⊕ KC . Later, Bob and Charlie can collaborate to derive KA (=
KB ⊕ KC).
The modified MQSS protocol also uses the dense coding of GHZ state to encode the se-
cret. In addition, the technique of block-transmission and decoy single photons are applied
to improve Deng et al.’s protocol. It is also straightforward to generalize the modified proto-
col to multiparty. For this case, Alice should prepare multi-photon GHZ states and the same
steps have to be performed as described in Sect. 3.1.
3.2 Security Analysis
Essentially, the security of the modified MQSS protocol is based on the public discussion
over decoy single photons. In the following section, we will analyze the Intercept-and-
Resend attack, the Entangle-and-Measure attack and the Security under a noisy quantum
channel for the proposed protocol.
3.2.1 Intercept-and-Resend Attack
Suppose that Bob is dishonest and tries to obtain Charlie’s unitary operations to reveal Al-
ice’s secret alone. Bob creates n GHZ states in |1〉 and let S ′C be the set of the second
photons of these GHZ states. Then, he intercepts SC sent from Alice to Charlie and instead
sends S ′C to Charlie. After Charlie receives the S ′C , she performs unitary operations on S ′C
and randomly inserts decoy single photons into S ′C to form S ′′C . S ′′C is then sent back to Alice
as described in Step 2 of the modified scheme. At this moment, Bob intercepts S ′′C . He tries
to reveal Charlie’s unitary operations by performing GHZ measurement on these GHZ states
forged by himself.
It is obvious that because Bob does not know the positions of these decoy single photons
inserted by Charlie, he will not only be unable to obtain Charlie’s raw key but also be
detected in the latter public discussion between Alice and Charlie. Without knowing the
polarization state, the probability for a random guess on a decoy single photon to pass the
public discussion is 34 (the same as in the BB84 protocol [1]). Therefore, the probability
for any eavesdropper, Eve, (let alone Bob) to pass the public discussion is ( 34 )l for l decoy
single photons. While l is large enough, the probability that Eve can be detected in the public
discussion is approximately 1.

The modified protocol Deng et al.’s protocol
Qubit efficiency 25 16
Number of classical communications 1 n
Number of quantum communications 2 3n2
3.3 Efficiency Analysis
In this section, we discuss the efficiency of the modified protocol and compare it with Deng
et al.’s protocol (also see Table 1). Let the qubit efficiency be ηq = quqt , where qu is the
number of bits shared and qt is the total amount of photons. The quantum communica-
tion means that the photons are transmitted from one to another. The classical communica-
tion means that the classical information are exchanged between the two parties for every
photon-transmission. In our modified protocol, Alice generates n GHZ states to share 2n
bits of information and Bob and Charlie have to prepare l decoy single photons, respec-
tively. To provide appropriate security, let the decoy single photons l = n [1]. Thus, in the
modified protocol, the qubit efficiency ηq is 2n3n+2n = 25 . Since the block transmission is used
in the modified protocol, the number of classical communications is 1 and the number of
quantum communications is 2. In Deng et al.’s MQSS, each GHZ state also shares two bits
of information, but only n4 GHZ states are used to share information. It is obvious that in
Deng et al.’s protocol, the qubit efficiency ηq is 2n3n × 14 = 16 . In addition, Deng et al.’s pro-
tocol requires the agents to exchange classical information to know their selections of the
mode and need quantum transmission for every photon-transmission. Therefore, the number
of classical communications and quantum communications are n and 3n2 (see also Sect. 2),
respectively.
4 Conclusions
This paper has modified Deng et al.’s MQSS protocol by using the techniques of block-
transmission and decoy single photons. In Deng et al.’s MQSS protocol, it spends a lot
of photons for public discussion. In contrast, the modified protocol reduces the number of
photons for eavesdropper check and enhances the utilization rate of photons. Consequently,
the qubit efficiency of the modified protocol is 2.4 times better than the original one. And the
number of classical communications and quantum communications in the modified protocol
are only 1 and 2 while that of Deng et al.’s is n and 3n2 .

1 Introduction
Quantum cryptography has become one of the most
important research areas in quantum information with the
rapid development of quantum physics. Quantum cryp-
tography combines quantum mechanics and classical com-
munications to achieve unconditional security. Among the
research in quantum cryptography, quantum secret shar-
ing (QSS) which integrates quantum mechanics with clas-
sical secret sharing concept is getting much attention re-
cently. Similar to the purpose of quantum key distribution
protocol which shares a common secret key between two
parties, the purpose of QSS protocol is to split a secret in-
formation into several shadows and share them with many
parties. Each shadow alone can not recover the secret, but
enough shadows can do that. For example, a three-party
QSS protocol allows a boss (say Alice) to split her secret
into two shadows. Then Alice sends one shadow to each of
her two agents (say Bob and Charlie), respectively. Each
agent alone can not recover Alice’s secret. Only when
they collaborate, Alice’s secret can be recovered. There-
fore, Alice’s secret can be protected from being revealed
by a potentially dishonest agent alone.
In 1999, Hillery et al.[1] took advantage of the proper-
ties of GHZ states to propose the first QSS protocol. From
then on, many QSS protocols[2−15] have been proposed
with different quantum states and quantum mechanics.
In general, these QSS protocols can be divided into three
kinds according to the quantum states being used.[2−5]
are designed with the single photons. Refs. [6]–[14] are
constructed using the EPR pairs. The third kind utilizes
GHZ states to construct the QSS protocols.[1,15]
Recently, Gao[16] used two-photon three-dimensional
Bell states to construct a multiparty quantum secret shar-
ing (MQSS) protocol. In Gao’s MQSS protocol, the secret
messages are encoded by performing local unitary opera-
tions. This is different from those QSS protocols[2,12,14]
that all shadows must make a state measurement. Gao’s
protocol was claimed to have the merit of high capacity.
In this study, it is found that the performance of Gao’s
protocol can be much improved by using the technique
of decoy single photons. In addition, this study modifies
Gao’s protocol so that some unnecessary unitary opera-
tions, devices, and transmissions can be reduced.
The remainder of this study is organized as follows.
Section 2 first reviews Gao’s MQSS protocol. Then, Sec-
tion 3 improves Gao’s protocol. The performance and
security of the improved protocol are also discussed here.
Section 4 concludes the results.
2 Review of Gao’s QSS Protocol
This section briefly reviews the generalized two-photon
three-dimensional Bell basis and Gao’s MQSS protocol.
The two sets of three-dimensional measuring basis (MB)
can be written as follows:
Three-dimensional Z-MB:
|Z0〉 = |0〉 , |Z1〉 = |1〉 , |Z2〉 = |2〉 . (1)
Three-dimensional X-MB:
|X0〉 = 1√
3
(|0〉+ |1〉+ |2〉) ,
|X1〉 = 1√
3
(|0〉+ e2pi i/3|1〉+ e−2pi i/3|2〉) ,
|X2〉 = 1√
3
(|0〉+ e−2pi i/3|1〉+ e2pi i/3|2〉) . (2)
The generalized two-photon three-dimensional Bell ba-
sis can be written as follows:

Step 2 After he receives SA1 from Alice, Bob has to
ascertain whether the received photons are single pho-
tons or not by using photon number splitter (PNS)[17]
and single-photon detectors.[17] Bob then randomly per-
forms one of the operations, |U00〉, |U01〉, |U02〉, |U10〉,
|U11〉, |U12〉, |U20〉, |U21〉, |U22〉, on each photon in SA1
and randomly inserts l decoy single photons (|0〉, |1〉, |+〉 =
(1/
√
2)(|0〉+|1〉), |−〉 = (1/√2)(|0〉−|1〉)) into SA1 to form
S
′
A1. Then he sends S
′
A1 to Charlie.
Step 3 Upon receiving S′A1 from Bob, Charlie and Bob
perform public discussions and use the decoy single pho-
tons to make sure that there is no eavesdropping.
Step 4 Alice encodes her secret by performing local uni-
tary operations Unm on SA2 and randomly inserts l decoy
single photons into SA2 to form S
′
A2. Then, she sends S
′
A2
to Charlie.
Step 5 After confirming that Charlie has received S′A2,
Alice announces the positions of the decoy single photons
and then they use these photons for eavesdropping check.
They proceed the following step if there is no eavesdrop-
per.
Step 6 Charlie performs Bell measurement on these pho-
tons. By comparing the initial Bell states, Bob’s unitary
operations and Charlie’s Bell measuring result, Bob and
Charlie can collaborate to obtain Alice’s secret.
In the above modified Gao’s MQSS protocol, Alice uses
the local unitary operations Unm to encode her secret.
Bob uses the unitary operations and Charlie uses the Bell
measuring results to derive Alice’s secret together. The
decoy single photons are used in the modified protocol to
check eavesdroppings. The only operation for Charlie to
do is to perform Bell measurement. He does not have to
additionally perform the unitary operation on SA2. More-
over, Charlie nee not send the photons in SA1 back to
Alice for eavesdropping check. Thus, the devices used to
prevent trojan horse attack are not needed here.
The three-party case has been described above. It is
also straightforward to generalize the modified protocol to
multiparty, i.e., (Bob, Bob1, Bob2, . . ., Bobm and Char-
lie). In the multiparty case, the Step 2 has to be repeated
for Bob1, . . ., Bobm who perform unitary operations on
the photons respectively and the processed photons are
transmitted from Bob to Bob1, . . . until Bobm sequen-
tially. At last, photons are sent from Bobm to Charlie.
Then, Alice performs Step 4 to encodes her secret and
sends her photons to the final agent, Charlie. After that,
Alice and Charlie performs Step 5 for eavesdropping check.
And when Step 6 is finished, the multiparty QSS protocol
can be accomplished. Bob, Bob1, . . ., Bobm and Charlie
can work together to recover Alice’s secret then.
3.2 Security Analysis
In this section, the security of the modified Gao’s
MQSS protocol is discussed. Essentially, the security of
the modified protocol is based on the public discussion on
the inserted decoy single photons. The following analyzes
the Intercept-and-Resend attack and the Entanglement-
and-Measure attack, against the proposed protocol.
(i) Intercept-and–Resend Attack:
In order to check whether SA1 is transmitted securely
or not, Bob randomly inserts l decoy single photons to
SA1. The eavesdropper may try to measure and then re-
send the quantum sequence in hope to pass the checking
process of public discussion. Without knowing the polar-
ization states, the probability for a random guess on a
decoy single photon to pass the public discussion is 3/4
(the same as in the BB84 protocol[20]). Therefore, the
probability for an eavesdropper, Eve, to pass the public
discussion is (3/4)l, where l is the number of the decoy
single photons. While l is large enough, the probability
that Eve passes the eavesdropping detection in the public
discussion is very small. It is the same for SA2. There-
fore, SA1 and SA2 can be transmitted securely due to the
utilization of decoy single photons.
(ii) Entangle-and–Measure Attack:[21]
A dishonest agent, say Bob, may try to recover the
dealer’s secret without the help of the other agent, Char-
lie. Since he does not know the positions and the
states of the decoy photons in the intercepted Charlie’s
sequence, S′A2, Bob then prepares some ancillas E =
{|E1〉, |E2〉, . . . , |Em〉} and entangles these ancillas with
the S′A2 by performing a unitary operation Uˆ (explained
later) in hope that he can pass the eavesdropping check
between Alice and Charlie and also derive useful informa-
tion about Charlie’s shadow. However, the effect of Bob’s
operation on the decoy photons will produce the following
results:
Uˆ · |0〉|Ei〉 = α|0〉|e00〉+ β|1〉|e01〉 , (7)
Uˆ · |1〉|Ei〉 = γ|0〉|e10〉+ δ|1〉|e11〉 , (8)
Uˆ · |+〉|Ei〉 = 1
2
(|+〉(α|e00〉+ β|e01〉
+ γ|e10〉+ δ|e11〉)
+ |−〉(α|e00〉 − β|e01〉
+ γ|e10〉 − δ|e11〉)) , (9)
Uˆ · |−〉|Ei〉 = 1
2
(|+〉(α|e00〉+ β|e01〉
− γ|e10〉 − δ|e11〉)
+ |−〉(α|e00〉 − β|e01〉
− γ|e10〉+ δ|e11〉) , (10)
where Uˆ · Uˆ † = Uˆ † · Uˆ = I; |Ei〉 is the initial state of Bob’s
ancilla; |e00〉, |e01〉, |e10〉, |e11〉 are the four states, which
can be distinguished by Bob and |α2|+ |β2| = |γ2|+ |δ2| =
1. In order to pass the eavesdropping check, Bob has to
set β = γ = 0, if Alice’s decoy photons are |0〉 or |1〉. Sim-
ilarly, Bob has to set α|e00〉 − β|e01〉 + γ|e10〉 − δ|e11〉 =
α|e00〉+ β|e01〉 − γ|e10〉 − δ|e11〉 = ~0, if Alice’s decoy pho-
tons are |+〉 or |−〉, where ~0 denotes a zero vector. In
this situation, Bob’s attack will not be detected in the
