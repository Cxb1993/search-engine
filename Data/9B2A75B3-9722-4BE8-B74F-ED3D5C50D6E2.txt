Abstract 
 
 The high-temperature mechanical properties of a newly developed silicate-based glass 
sealant, designated as GC-9, have been studied for use in planar solid oxide fuel cell (pSOFC).  
Four-point bending tests were conducted at room temperature, 550oC, 600oC, 650oC, 700oC 
and 750oC to investigate the variation of  flexural strength, elastic modulus, and stress 
relaxation with temperature for the given glass sealant.  Weibull statistic analysis was 
applied to describe the fracture strength data.  The results indicated that the flexural strength 
was increased with temperature when the testing temperature was below the glass transition 
temperature (Tg, 668oC).  This was presumably caused by a crack healing effect taking place 
at high temperatures for glasses.  However, with a further increase of temperature to a level 
higher than Tg, significant stress relaxation was observed to cause extremely large 
deformation without breaking the specimen. 
 The effects of crystallization on the high-temperature mechanical properties of this newly 
developed GC-9 glass sealant were also studied.  The aged, crystallized GC-9 glass sealant 
was produced by heat treatment of the original GC-9 glass at 900oC for 3 h.  Not only 
crystalline phases were formed but the residual glass was also changed in the aged GC-9 glass 
during the crystallization process.  The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the given glass 
was reduced but the softening temperature (Ts) was increased by such a crystallization heat 
treatment.  The same experimental procedures for the non-aged GC-9 glass were carried out 
to determine the mechanical properties of the aged GC-9 glass.  The aged GC-9 glass 
exhibited a greater flexural strength and Young’s modulus than did the original, non-aged one 
at temperature below 650oC due to the existence of crystalline phases in the glassy matrix.  
At temperature of 700oC and 750oC, a greater extent of stress relaxation was found in the 
aged GC-9 glass such that its strength and stiffness was much lower than those of the 
non-aged one.  The changes in the thermal and mechanical properties of the GC-9 glass 
sealant through the given aging treatment were favorable for application of this newly 
developed glass sealant in intermediate-temperature pSOFC.

sealants are two important factors related to thermal stress distribution and mechanical 
integrity in a pSOFC stack.   On the other hand, chemical stability of seals is also an 
important issue.  If vaporization of seals occurs during operation, weight loss can lead to 
sealant collapse [12, 13].  A large number of studies on the chemical interactions between 
sealants and adjacent components and their vaporization reactions in operating atmosphere 
have been carried out [11-19] and most of them were focused on the chemical stability and 
compatibility of crystallization process of glasses and glass ceramics in SOFC operating 
environment.  Changes of material properties in the glass sealant due to crystallization might 
influence its compatibility with other components and the long-term stability and mechanical 
integrity of a pSOFC stack.  Therefore, crystallization of glass sealants during fabrication 
and cyclic thermal operation is necessary to be investigated.  To date, only a few studies [1, 
10, 11] have investigated the complex crystallization effect on the mechanical properties and 
mechanism behavior of glass sealants.   
 Different glass systems have been studied for application in various ranges of operating 
temperature and cell designs of SOFC [3, 4].  Recently, a self-healing feature of some glass 
systems, which have the ability to heal cracks or defects in material at high temperatures, has 
attracted more attention [1, 5, 20].  Such seals can meet the long-term operation 
requirements.  A BaO-B2O3-Al2O3-SiO2 glass (designated as GC-9 glass) recently developed 
for use in intermediate-temperature (700-750oC) pSOFC is one kind of these self-healing 
glass systems [20].  This glass showed good thermal and chemical properties [21-23] and 
high-temperature mechanical properties [20].  Such a glass system can repair the defects 
produced during fabrication and/or operation due to a self-healing ability [20].  However, it 
might crystallize at high temperatures leading to changes of its mechanical properties.  There 
are limited studies [1, 10, 11] on the effects of crystallization on the mechanical properties of 
glass sealants for use in pSOFC stacks.  This issue is important to design a reliable pSOFC 
stack and evaluate its long-term structural durability.  As part of a series of studies [20] on 
the high-temperature mechanical properties of glass sealants for pSOFC, the aim of this study 
is thus to investigate the mechanical properties of the crystallized GC-9 glass and make a 
comparison with those in its uncrystallized state.  In this regard, the crystallization effect on 
the mechanical properties of such a newly developed glass sealant can be understood.  A 
heat treatment was performed on the GC-9 glass to generate crystalline phases in the material.  
Systematic four-point bending tests were then conducted at the temperature range of room 
temperature to 750oC for the crystallized GC-9 glass (hereafter called aged GC-9 glass) to 
investigate variation of the mechanical properties with temperature.

polished by 0.3-μmAl2O3 powders to minimize the effect of surface defect.  Four-point 
bending tests of the aged GC-9 glass specimens were conducted as per ASTM C1211 [24] to 
characterize the mechanical properties of this aged glass sealant at operating temperature.  
The four-point bending tests were performed by using a commercial closed-loop 
servo-hydraulic testing machine attached with a furnace.  The flexural loading fixture with a 
20-mm inner loading span and 40-mm outer loading span was made of alumina in order to 
perform tests at high temperatures.  The testing temperatures were set at 25oC, 550oC, 600oC, 
650oC, 700oC, and 750oC.  For each high-temperature test, the specimen was heated to the 
specified temperature at a heating rate of 6 oCmin-1.  The specimen was then held at the 
specified temperature for 3 min before applying the load.  The load was applied under 
displacement control with a displacement rate of 0.005 mms-1 for all the given testing 
temperatures.  The load-displacement relationship was recorded for each test to calculate the 
flexural strength and related properties. 
 
2.4. Weibull statistic analysis 
 
 The Weibull statistics [25] is widely applied to describe the fracture behavior of brittle 
materials.  Based on a weakest-link hypothesis, it is assumed that the most severe flaw 
controls the strength.  When subjected to an applied stress, σ, the cumulative probability of 
failure for a brittle material can be expressed by [25]

where F is the failure probability for an applied stress σ, σo is a normalizing parameter, σu is 
the threshold stress (below which no failure will occur), and m is the Weibull modulus.  Here, 
the Weibull modulus m is a measure of the degree of strength data dispersion.   If σu is 
assumed to be zero, Eq. (1) becomes a two-parameter relation, as shown below [25]

the glassy matrix containing microvoids.  The white spots in Fig. 2(b) are the crystalline 
phases while the residual glass is in the grey region.  The crystalline phases are arbitrarily 
and uniformly distributed in the glassy matrix.  The fine and uniform crystalline structure 
and microvoids throughout the bulk of the aged GC-9 glass are important characteristics.  As 
glass-ceramic materials contain arbitrarily oriented crystals, their properties are independent 
of orientation.  The microvoids observed in the aged GC-9 glass might be generated during 
glass forming, machining, grinding, and/or by thermal shock during heat treatment.  They 
might even be formed during heating or cooling step due to CTE mismatch between the 
crystalline phases and residual glass of the GC-9 material.   
 
4.2. Thermal properties  
 
 Thermal expansion curves of the non-aged and aged GC-9 glass are shown in Fig. 3.  
CTE mismatch between the non-aged and aged GC-9 glass can be seen in these two curves.  
Since the thermal expansion curve is an averaged function of each phase in a sample, the 
difference in these two curves implies that crystallization indeed changed the CTE of the 
given GC-9 glass.  The thermal expansion curve of the non-aged GC-9 glass showed good 
CTE match with other SOFC component materials [20].  Although the thermal expansion 
curve of the aged GC-9 glass is different from that of the non-aged state, the CTE of the aged 
GC-9 glass still has a value in the range of 9-12×10-6 oC-1.  Therefore, the crystallized, aged 
GC-9 glass is expected to have good CTE match with other SOFC components even though 
the crystalline phases were generated through aging treatment of the GC-9 glass.   
 Note the sudden rise in the thermal expansion curve of a typical glass corresponds to the 
onset of glass transition from solid to liquid state and this point is called Tg.  The peak of the 
thermal expansion curve represents the softening point (Ts).  The Tg and Ts of the non-aged 
and aged GC-9 glass are labeled in Fig. 3.  As shown in Fig. 3, the Tg and Ts points of the 
aged GC-9 glass can be clearly identified indicating existence of residual glass in this aged 
glass material.  Furthermore, the Tg (650oC) and Ts (826oC) of the aged GC-9 glass are 
different from those of the GC-9 glass, 668oC and 745oC, respectively.  Compared with the 
non-aged GC-9 glass, the Tg for the aged GC-9 glass is lower while the Ts is greater.  It 
means the residual glass in the aged GC-9 glass was different form the original GC-9 glass 
and the glass phase was apparently changed during the crystallization process.  The chemical 
composition of the residual glass phase in a glass ceramic is associated with the heat 
treatment and the initial glass composition [27-29].  The crystallization heat treatment can 
10 
temperature due to the existence of crystalline phase in the matrix [27].  However, there was 
a different trend in the current study at temperature of 650oC and above.  The main reason is 
that the residual glass has lower Tg and started to influence the mechanical behavior around it 
Tg, 650oC. 
 As shown in Fig. 4(a), stress relaxation took place at 700oC and 750oC, which are above 
the Tg of the non-aged GC-9 glass, because of softening of the glass phase.  When the testing 
temperature was at 700oC and 750oC, the residual glass in the aged GC-9 glass showed a 
greater extent of stress relaxation than did the original glass, as shown in Fig. 4(b).  This 
might help release more stress due to thermal mismatch during SOFC operation.  Ts is the 
temperature point where a glass will have a higher viscosity to flow.  The Ts of the aged 
GC-9 glass was shifted to a temperature higher than that of the original GC-9 glass, from 
745oC to 826oC.  After the crystallization heat treatment, the aged GC-9 glass had a greater 
extent of stress relaxation at 700oC and 750oC and no overflow problem was expected at the 
targeted working temeature due to its higher Ts.  From this point of view, control of the 
crystalline phase and residual glass is important to develop a suitable sealant for pSOFC.   
 In the present study, not only non-linear fracture behavior but also intense stress relaxation 
for the aged GC-9 glass could be seen at temperature higher than Tg.  The residual glass in 
the aged GC-9 glass was the main factor to control the high-temperature mechanical behavior 
at temperature of 650oC and above even though the crystalline phases were present in the 
aged GC-9 glass.  Nguyen et al. [32] attributed the non-linear response of a G-18 glass at 
high temperature to viscoelastic behavior of porous and glassy phases, void initiation and 
growth, crystalline/glass phase decohesion, microcracking and/or plasticity of glassy phases.   
In the current study, although the aged GC-9 glass was crystallized during heat treatment, 
non-linear response still took place at 650oC and above.  Such a non-linear response was 
considered to be caused by viscoelastic and/or plastic flow of the glassy phase at a 
temperature of Tg or above for the aged GC-9 glass.  The Tg of the aged GC-9 glass was 
shifted to 650oC and, therefore, the non-linear response occurred at a lower temperature than 
that in the non-aged GC-9 glass.  As the expected working temperature for the given aged 
GC-9 glass is between 700 and 750oC, the stress relaxation phenomenon is favorable in 
reducing the stresses produced from thermal mismatch.  
 
4.4. Fracture strength and Weibull statistics

healed due to the aforementioned crack healing effect [20].  This self-healing effect 
presumably also took place in the aged GC-9 glass.  As the crack healing mechanism could 
relax the stress concentration around surface flaws, change flaw outlines or totally heal the 
crack, scattering of the strength data at high temperature became smaller [20].   Note the 
improvements of the Weibull modulus at high temperatures over room temperature for the 
aged GC-9 glass were greater than those for the non-aged GC-9 glass.  This implies that 
there was a superior crack healing effect acting on the aged GC-9 glass from the residual glass 
in the aged GC-9 glass.  The Weibull modulus of the aged GC-9 glass at room temperature 
was smaller than that of the non-aged GC-9 glass, while the values at high temperatures were 
greater than those of the non-aged GC-9 glass except at 650oC.  It is obvious that the 
strength-determining defects at room temperature were different from those at high 
temperatures.  There are crystalline phases and microvoids in the aged GC-9 glass (Fig. 2(a)) 
so that the scattering of the strength data at room temperature was greater than that of the 
non-aged GC-9 glass without any crystalline phase.  However, the scattering of the strength 
data of the aged GC-9 glass at 550oC and 600oC was smaller than that of the non-aged one as 
the residual glass in the aged GC-9 glass more effectively healed the defects in the matrix.  
Apparently, the residual glass in the aged GC-9 glass had a better flowable ability than did the 
glassy phase of the non-aged GC-9 glass.  However, the aged GC-9 glass at 650oC shows a 
reduction of the Weibull modulus, possibly, due to a competition of deformation mechanism 
between brittle fracture and viscous flow at temperature around Tg.  
 
4.5. Influence of environmental temperature on Young’s modulus 
 
 Table 2 lists the calculated Young’s moduli (averaged value and standard deviation) at 
various temperatures for the non-aged and aged GC-9 glass.  As there was significant stress 
relaxation at 750oC for both the non-aged and aged GC-9 glass, their Young’s modulus could 
not be determined at this temperature.  The Young’s modulus of the non-aged and aged GC-9 
glass barely changed with temperature form room temperature to 600oC, as shown in Table 2.  
Note that the averaged value of the Young’s modulus for the aged GC-9 glass is slightly larger 
than the corresponding one of the non-aged GC-9 glass at the temperature range of 25-600oC 
due to absence of crystalline phase in the non-aged one.  Above 600oC, the Young’s modulus 
for both the non-aged and aged GC-9 glass exhibited a decrease with an increase in 
temperature and the Young’s modulus of the aged GC-9 glass even showed a lower value than 
that of the non-aged one.  The non-aged and aged GC-9 glass behaved as a brittle material at 
14 
GC-9 glass were enhanced by formation of crystalline phases in the glass matrix, as 
compared to the non-aged, original GC-9 glass.  However, when the testing temperature 
was increased to 700oC and 750oC, the flexural strength and Young’s modulus of the aged 
GC-9 glass was significantly lower than those of the non-aged one due to a greater extent 
of stress relaxation provided by the residual glass phase in the aged GC-9 glass.  
4. The given crystallization heat treatment is favorable for applying the GC-9 glass sealant to 
intermediate-temperature pSOFC, as crystalline phases in the aged GC-9 glass can offer a 
greater strength at low temperature and the residual glass can offer a greater effect on 
releasing the stress generated by thermal mismatch during SOFC operation.

A 3-D finite element analysis (FEA) model of a 3-cell stack based on a 
prototype planar SOFC stack design was constructed to perform 
thermal stress analyses at shutdown and steady operation conditions.  
The constructed 3-D FEA model consists of complete planar SOFC 
components such as positive electrode-electrolyte-negative electrode 
(PEN) assembly, interconnect, nickel mesh, and gas-tight glass-ceramic 
seal.  The thermal stress distributions at shutdown and steady-state 
stages as well as their dependence on the initial stress-free temperature 
and operation cycles were systematically evaluated.  Modeling results 
indicated that the glass-ceramic sealant was the most critical part 
needed to be watched in terms of structural integrity, in particular at 
operation temperature where shear fracture of such a component was 
predicted.  Localized plastic deformation was predicted for the 
metallic interconnect and frame at both shutdown and steady-state 
conditions.  An increase in the initial stress-free temperature would 
significantly increase the thermal stresses in all of the components at 
both shutdown and steady-state stages.  In addition, a notable increase 
of thermal stress with increasing cycle number in the PEN at 
steady-state stage as well as in the glass-ceramic sealant at shutdown 
stage was predicted. 
 
Introduction 
 
Compared with other fuel cells, the most important features of SOFC are that the operation 
temperature is high and that the cell components are all made of solid materials.  The 
high-temperature operation, however, gives rise to significant thermal stresses caused from 
the mismatch of coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) among various components and 
temperature gradients in the SOFC system.  Therefore, a comprehensive thermal stress 
analysis of SOFC stack is necessary for the success in design and operation of a SOFC system.  
There are a few studies in the literature which have investigated the thermal stresses in SOFCs 
(1-8).  Some of these studies were mainly focused on the thermal stresses caused only by the 
mismatch of CTE between the electrolyte and electrode layers for a given temperature change 
without considering the temperature gradients within the PEN and thermal interactions 
between PEN and other cell components (1-5).  Other studies used finite element analysis 
(FEA) to calculate the thermal stresses by developing and employing coupled 
thermo-electrochemical models to generate the needed temperature profiles for planar SOFCs 
(6,7).  However, in such studies, for the sake of simplicity in calculation, a single-cell stack 
model was constructed and cell components such as gas seals were not included in the 3-D 
FEA model (6,7).  As the planar type of SOFC requires high-temperature gas seals such as 
glass and glass-ceramic materials to bond the cell components and separate the fuel and air 
32 
the PENs and connecting interconnects.  The gas channels in the interconnects were also 
included to get a more realistic simulation.  The sizes of the PEN and interconnect are 80 x 
80 mm2 and 150 x 100 mm2, respectively.  The thickness of the PEN is 0.7 mm while the 
thickness of the interconnect and frame is between 2 and 2.5 mm.  An 8-node continuum 
shell element (SC8R) was employed in this study (10).  From a modeling point of view, 
continuum shell elements look like 3-D continuum solids, but their kinematic and constitutive 
behavior is similar to that of conventional shell elements (10).  There are total 30687 
elements and 52267 nodes in this 3-D model.  Note that in Fig. 1, the fuel inlet for this 
counter-flow planar SOFC is located at the left end of the stack while the air inlet is located at 
the right end of the stack. 
 
Stresses caused by self weight of SOFC components are so small that they can be 
neglected in this simulation.  A “tight-bonding constraint” condition was set between the 
glass-ceramic seals and connecting components.  A frictionless “contact constraint” 
condition was set in the FEA modeling for the contact pairs, such as (i) PENs with gas 
channels of the interconnects, (ii) PENs with nickel meshes, and (iii) nickel meshes with 
interconnects.  A simply edge-supported condition was set on the bottom surface of the 
3-cell stack such that the edges of the bottom surface were constrained in the direction normal 
to the bottom plane.  An additional constraint was applied to an edge point on the symmetric 
plane to prevent rigid body motion of the whole stack model. 
 
Material Properties 
 
As an anode-supported PEN is typically composed of Ni/YSZ cermet structure, 
temperature-dependent elastic properties of a Ni/YSZ anode was used for the PEN in the 
present work (11).  As the PEN is basically composed of ceramic materials, it was assumed 
to deform elastically at both room temperature (RT) and operation temperature.  The 
material selected for the interconnect and PEN-supporting frame is a ferritic stainless steel, 
Crofer 22-APU.  Tensile properties for Crofer 22-APU had been determined in-house from 
RT to 850 oC and given in Ref. (8).  In the FEA calculation, plastic deformation was allowed 
for the interconnect and frame at both RT and operation temperature.  The elastic properties 
of G-18 (a barium-calcium aluminosilicate glass-ceramic material) given in Refs. (12,13) 
were used for the gas seals in the current study.  As shown in Ref. (12), the 
load-displacement curves for G-18 were linear until failure for temperature up to 700 oC, 
while the response became nonlinear for temperature higher than 700 oC such that inelastic 
deformation was considered for gas seals at temperatures above 700 oC in the current FEA 
calculation.  Based on measurement of the density of the nickel mesh used in the given 
prototype planar SOFC, the elastic modulus of the nickel mesh was obtained by assuming that 
there’s 95 vol.% of porosity in the nickel mesh such that 5% of the elastic modulus of bulk 
nickel was used for the nickel mesh.  Elastic properties of the bulk nickel are obtained from 
Refs. (14,15).  In the FEA calculation, the nickel mesh was assumed to deform elastically at 
both RT and operation temperature due to its great flexibility with small induced thermal 
stresses.  Details of the specific values of the material properties as well as the thermal 
expansion behavior used in the FEA calculation for the materials mentioned above can be 
found in Ref. (8). 
 
Temperature Profiles and Analysis Procedure 
 
The steady-state temperature profiles at operation were generated through an approach 
combining electrochemical and heat-transfer analyses developed at INER using a 3-cell-stack 
34 
material.  The average strength of an anode-supported PEN at RT is 187 MPa and is 
estimated to be decreased to 112 MPa at 800 oC (8,11,16).  The metallic interconnect/frame 
is ductile at RT and operation temperature such that notable plastic deformation will occur if 
the Tresca equivalent stress (TES) exceeds the yield strength of Crofer 22-APU.  Note that 
TES is defined as twice the maximum shear stress at a point (17).  The yield and tensile 
strength of Crofer 22-APU at different temperatures were tested in house and given in Ref. (8).  
In the current FEA model, plastic deformation of the metallic interconnect/frame was allowed 
to take place once the stress reached the yield strength.  The stresses in the nickel mesh were 
calculated but failure of this part was not considered due to its great flexibility and small 
thermal stress.  As glass-ceramics are brittle at RT but tend to exhibit a nonlinear response at 
temperature above the glass transition temperature, Tg, two different criteria were applied to 
define the failure of glass-ceramic sealants at RT and operation temperature.  Failure of the 
glass-ceramic sealant at RT was defined when the MPS exceeded the tensile strength while 
Tresca criterion was applied at operation temperature.  The flexural strength of G-18 sealant 
obtained by four-point bending at RT and 800 oC is 48 and 36 MPa, respectively, while the 
shear strength at 800 oC is 20 MPa (12,18).  In the analysis procedure, the thermal stress 
distribution in each SOFC stack component was first determined by the FEA model and then 
the critical stress values were compared with the corresponding material strength according to 
the aforementioned criteria.

In this section, results for the case with an initial stress-free temperature of 800 oC are 
presented first as a basis case to discuss the thermal stress distributions in the cell components 
at both shutdown and steady-state stages during the first operation cycle.  Results for other 
initial stress-free temperatures (900 oC and 1000 oC) and subsequent operation cycles will be 
presented and discussed in the following sections.  The calculated stress distributions for 
each cell component at both shutdown and steady operation conditions are presented 
individually.  Only the maximum principal or shear stresses, hereafter also called the critical 
stresses, in each component of the entire 3-cell stack were identified and discussed.  Fig. 3(a) 
shows the distributions of maximum in-plane principal stress (MIPPS) in the PENs at RT 
after cooling down from the assembling temperature 800 oC.  Generally speaking, edges of 
the PENs were the regions having higher MIPPSs and their values were higher than 120.7 
MPa, as shown in Fig. 3(a).  Note that these edge areas of the PEN are tightly bonded with 
the connecting glass-ceramic sealant.  As the temperature fields at both the assembling 
temperature 800 oC and RT were assumed a uniform distribution without any temperature 
gradient, the stress fields shown in Fig. 3(a) were essentially due to CTE mismatch between 
components.  The most highly-stressed region in each PEN layer appeared at the corners.

interconnects and frames.  The maximum shear strain obtained for the interconnects and 
frames at RT was 1.88% indicating a considerable plastic deformation at these regions.  Fig. 
5(b) shows the distributions of TES in the interconnects and frames at steady operation.  The 
greatest TES at steady operation was 83.27 MPa and the corresponding temperature at these 
areas was about 710 oC.  This maximum TES value had exceeded the estimated yield 
strength of Crofer 22-APU at 710 oC (65 MPa) so that considerable plastic deformation might 
occur at these regions in the interconnects/frames at steady operation.  This can also be 
evidenced by the calculated maximum shear strain with a value of 1.53%.

Thermal stress distributions for the cases with an initial stress-free temperature of 900 and 
1000 oC were also obtained and compared with those for the basis case of 800 oC described 
above.  Instead of showing the detailed stress distributions in each component at the 
shutdown and steady-state stages during the first operation cycle, only the critical stress 
values were listed in TABLE I for the given three initial stress-free temperatures.  As shown 
in TABLE I, the corresponding critical stress in each component at a given stage was 
significantly increased with an increase in stress-free temperature except for the glass-ceramic 
sealant at steady-state condition.  When the initial stress-free temperature was increased 
from 800 to 900 and 1000 oC, the greatest MIPPS in the PENs at RT was increased from 
171.6 to 205.9 and 244.4 MPa, respectively, which had exceeded the average strength of the 
PEN at RT (187 MPa).  This means that fracture would take place in the PENs when the 
SOFC stack was cooled down from an assembling temperature of 900 or 1000 oC.  Similarly, 
the MIPPS in the glass-ceramic sealants at RT was respectively increased to 157.2 and 187.7 
MPa after cooling down from an assembling temperature of 900 and 1000 oC.  Such high 
MIPPS values were well beyond the flexural strength of G18 at RT (48 MPa) indicating that 
breakage of the glass-ceramic bonds would take place after cooling from these two 
assembling temperatures to RT.  In addition, plastic deformation in the metallic 
interconnects and PEN-supporting frames was also expected to be enlarged at both shutdown 
38 
and might eventually cause failure of such components and degradation of the SOFC 
performance.  In addition, the SOFC stack was subjected to a fatigue-like loading such that 
the existing defects or voids in ceramic components might grow to become a critical crack 
and lead to degradation of the performance or failure of the SOFC stack even though the 
initial thermal stress was below the corresponding monotonic tensile or shear strength. 
 
Conclusions 
 
Simulation results indicated that the glass-ceramic sealant was apparently the most critical 
part of the prototype planar SOFC stack investigated, in particular at operation temperature 
where structural failure of such a component was predicted.  Therefore, the important role of 
the glass-ceramic sealant in the structural reliability of a planar SOFC stack should not be 
neglected in any thermal stress analysis for a practical SOFC system.  With regard to the 
metallic interconnect and frame, they might be acceptable depending on how much localized 
plastic deformation is allowed.  A lower initial stress-free temperature would lead to lower 
thermal stresses generated in the planar SOFC components.  With an increase in the number 
of operation cycles, the greatest maximum in-plane principal stress in the PENs at steady state 
was steadily increased and the cyclic operation of SOFC could produce fatigue-like loading 
which may cause growth of existing defects in the ceramic PENs to become a critical crack.

Thermal stress distribution in a planar SOFC stack under shutdown and steady-operation 
conditions was analyzed by a commercial FEA code (ABAQUS) in this study. The FEA 
model was constructed based on the stack design being developed at the Institute of 
Nuclear Energy Research (INER). In the current study, such a 3-D model was constructed 
for a SOFC stack consisting of three unit cells. Each unit cell is composed of a PEN 
assembly, two interconnects with gas channels, and a nickel mesh. The PEN assembly 
was bonded with a supporting frame by using a glass-ceramic sealant. The three unit cells 
were joined together to become a 3-cell SOFC stack by using a compressive sealant, mica, 
to seal the PEN-supporting frames with the connecting interconnects. Figure 1 is the 
schematic of one-half of this planar SOFC assembly. The sizes of the PEN and 
interconnect used here are 80 × 80 mm2 and 150 × 100 mm2, respectively. The thickness of 
the PEN is 0.7 mm while the thickness of the interconnect and frame ranges from 2 to 2.5 
mm depending on the location of gas channels and other geometric needs in the plate. The 
FEA model constructed in this study was shown in Fig. 2. There are total 32060 elements 
and 55948 nodes in the 3-D model shown in Fig. 2.

A uniformly distributed, compressive load (0.1 MPa) was applied on the top surface of the 
top frame in the 3-cell stack, as required in the compressive sealing design to ensure a 
gas-tight sealing condition. In general, stresses caused by self-weight of SOFC 
components are relatively small compared to thermal stresses such that they were 
neglected in this simulation. In this model, a “tight-bonding constraint” condition was set 
between the glass-ceramic seal and the connecting PEN and frame. Contact between cell 
components, such as (1) PENs with gas channels of the interconnects, (2) PENs with nickel 
meshes, (3) nickel meshes with interconnect, (4) PEN-supporting frames with mica gaskets, 
and (5) interconnects with mica gaskets, was considered by setting a “contact constraint” 
condition for these contact pairs in the FEA modeling. The frictional force was neglected in 
setting such a contact constraint condition.

Investigated cases 
 
In practical application for a SOFC stack with a compressive sealing design, unit cells are 
usually assembled together to form a multiple-cell stack at 200-400 oC by using mica seal 
gaskets. After the assembling process, the multiple-cell stack is then slowly cooled down to 
RT for future operation. The given assembling temperatures of 200-400oC were defined as 
the initial stress-free condition. In this regard, in the following thermal stress analyses, the 
residual stresses in the SOFC stack at RT before operation will be firstly calculated by 
considering the temperature drop from 200-400 oC to RT. Then, the thermal stresses after 
start-up of the cell operation are evaluated with a consideration of such exiting residual 
stresses for each investigated case.  The analysis procedure is shown in Fig. 5.

Failure criteria 
 
The PEN material is brittle no matter at RT or operating temperature. Hence, failure of PEN 
is defined when the maximum principal stress exceeds the ultimate tensile strength of the 
material. The metallic interconnect is ductile during shutdown and operation conditions 
such that failure of the metallic interconnect is defined when the Tresca equivalent stress 
(TES) exceeds the yield strength of the interconnect material. As a glass-ceramic is brittle 
at RT but tends to exhibit a non-linear response at the temperature above the glass 
transition temperature, Tg, two different criteria were applied to define the failure of 
glass-ceramic sealant at room and operating temperature.  Failure of the glass-ceramic 
  50
which took place at the edges of the PENs at shutdown stage, were of the value of -167.9 
MPa. As the compressive strength of a ceramic material is usually greater than the tensile 
strength, such a compressive MIPPS at the edge of a PEN would not cause failure of the 
PEN.

Fig. 9 shows the distributions of TES in the interconnects and frames at different stages. 
The greatest TES for the interconnects and frames at shutdown stage was 244.0 MPa and 
lower than the yield strength of Crofer 22-APU at RT, 268 MPa [6]. The greatest TES at 
steady-operation condition was 76.94 MPa and took place at the areas near the 
glass-ceramic bonding regions in the PEN-supporting frames. The corresponding 
temperature at these highly-stressed areas was about 710 oC. Such maximum TESs had 
exceeded the estimated yield strength of Crofer 22-APU at 710 oC, 65 MPa [6], so that 
significantly localized plastic deformation might occur at these regions in the frames at 
steady operation. All the critical stresses for each component at various stages for the case 
with an assembly temperature of 200oC are shown in Table 2.

In order to select a proper assembly temperature for the investigated multiple-cell stack 
with a compressive sealing design, 300 oC and 400 oC were also used as the initial 
stress-free temperature in the FEA calculation.  Tables 3 and 4 show the critical thermal 
stress values for assembly temperatures of 300 and 400 oC, respectively.  Generally

Conclusions 
 
A 3-D FEA model of a 3-cell stack based on a prototype planar SOFC stack with a 
compressive sealing design was constructed in the current study to perform thermal stress 
analysis at the after-assembly, steady-operation, and shutdown stages. Stress fields at 
different stages and effect of anisotropic elastic moduli of mica sealant were investigated 
and simulation results were summarized as follows: 
 
(1) For an assembly temperature of 200 oC, the calculated, critical thermal stress in the 
PENs at operation stage exceeded the corresponding strength and fracture was predicted 
to take place at the corners.  The calculated, critical thermal stress in the glass-ceramic 
sealants at the steady-operation and shutdown stages was larger than the corresponding 
strength of G-18 and the greatest value occurred at the outer corners.  Localized plastic 
deformation in the interconnects and frames was predicted to occur at the operation stage.  
The calculated, greatest thermal stress in the compressive mica sealant was lower than the 
strength of mica at all stages. 
 
(2) When the assembly temperature was increased, the thermal stresses in each 
component were increased at RT after the assembling process.  However, the thermal 
stresses in each component at the steady-operation stage were barely affected by the 
changes of assembly temperature form 200 oC to 300 and 400 oC. 
 
(3) Two different elastic moduli of mica sealant were used in the FEA model to calculate the 
thermal stresses and the calculated, critical stresses in each component at a specific stage 
were comparable except for the mica sealants.

High-Temperature Fatigue Crack Growth Behavior of 17-4 PH Stainless 
Steels at Various Load Ratios

The high-temperature fatigue crack growth (FCG) behavior at 400 and 500oC was 
investigated for variously heat-treated 17-4 PH stainless steels under different 
load ratios.  Results indicated the FCG rates (FCGRs) at 400oC increased with 
R-ratio at the low ΔK regime and merged together at the high ΔK regime for all 
the given heat-treated conditions, except for a peak-aged condition.  At 500oC, 
the FCGRs of the given alloys increased with R-ratio at low R-ratios and became 
comparable at high R-ratios.  The variations of FCGR with R-ratio could be 
described as an intrinsic FCG behavior based on a Unified Approach.  
Accordingly, the predominant FCG mechanism was similar to a general plastic 
blunting process except for the high R-ratio regime of the peak-aged condition 
tested at 400oC. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
As a type of martensitic precipitation-hardening stainless steel, 17-4 PH alloy has 
been used extensively in various applications, such as nuclear, chemical, aircraft, 
and naval industries [1].  A wide range of mechanical properties can be obtained 
for the 17-4 PH stainless steel through suitable heat treatments in the temperature 
range of 482-621oC (900-1150oF) [1-6].  Maximum strength and hardness values 
are generally obtained after aging at 450-510oC, during which coherent 
copper-rich precipitate clusters are formed [1-3].  Aging at higher temperatures 
(above 540oC) leads to formation of large, incoherent copper-rich precipitates 
which result in a lower strength and hardness and an enhancement of toughness 
[1-3].  As many applications of the 17-4 PH stainless steel are involved with 
high temperatures, it is important to characterize the high-temperature fatigue 
behavior of the 17-4 PH alloy to better predict the service life of components 
made from this material.  Although there are some studies [7-11] focused on the 
high-temperature fatigue behavior of 17-4 PH stainless steels, there is lack of 
consideration of the effects of load ratio (R-ratio, R = Pmin/Pmax) on the fatigue 
crack growth (FCG) behavior of such steels.  As part of a series of studies on the 
high-temperature fatigue and mechanical properties of 17-4 PH stainless steels 
[7-12], the aim of this study is to investigate the influence of R-ratio on the 
high-temperature FCG behavior of such alloys at 400 and 500oC. 
 
2. Experimental Procedures 
 
The 17-4 PH stainless steels used in the present work were supplied by the vendor 
in the form of hot-rolled, solution-annealed plates.  The chemical composition of 
 66 
curves merged together at the higher ΔK regime, especially for those at higher 
R-ratios ( )3.0≥R .  A similar trend was observed for FCGRs of Condition H900 
at 400oC (Fig. 1(b)) under 5.0≤R , but the FCGRs were increased again with 
R-ratio at higher R-ratios (R > 0.5) for the entire ΔK regime.  For Condition 
H1150 at 500oC (Fig. 1(d)), the FCGRs were increased with R-ratio at lower 
R-ratios ( )3.0≤R  for the entire ΔK regime and became comparable with each 
other at higher R-ratios ( )3.0≥R .

An approach, called the “Unified Approach,” for considering the effect of R-ratio 
on FCG behavior was applied to describe the FCG behavior observed in the 
current study.  Such an approach has been described in many studies by 
Vasudevan, Sadananda, and co-workers (e.g., [13-19]).  It is assumed that for a 
fatigue crack to advance at a certain crack growth rate, two critical stress intensity 
factor values should be met simultaneously.  These values are a critical stress 
 68 
Unified Approach, data points deviated from the L-shape curve indicate that a 
different crack growth mechanism might take place at that specific regime [19].  
The FCGR data for Condition H900 at 400oC can then be divided into two regions, 
R = 0.1-0.5 and R ≥ 0.6, with each region having an individual crack growth 
mechanism with its own ΔK* and K*max [19].  Therefore, the FCG behavior of 
Condition H900 at 400oC was thought to have two controlling crack growth 
mechanisms, one dominating at the low R-ratio regime and the other dominating 
at the high R-ratio regime.  In this regard, the ΔK* and K*max values for the low 
R-ratio regime of Condition H900 at 400oC were determined by using the 
aforementioned procedures with the data of R = 0.1-0.5.  However, due to the 
limited data points at R = 0.6 and 0.7, the ΔK* and K*max values for the high 
R-ratio regime of Condition H900 at 400oC could not be completely determined.

3.2 Effects of R-ratio on fatigue crack growth mechanism 
 
The ΔK* and K*max values calculated using the procedures described above for the 
given testing conditions are present as ΔK* vs. K*max in Fig. 4.  Note that each 
 70 
trajectories only indicate similar crack growth mechanisms but not similar FCGRs.  
Therefore, such converged trajectories for Condition H1150 at 400 and 500oC and 
for the low R-ratio regime of Condition H900 at 400oC presumably represent a 
baseline crack growth mechanism of 17-4 PH alloy at high temperature. 
 
As described above, a different crack growth mechanism might take place at the 
high R-ratio regime (R = 0.6 and 0.7) of Condition H900 at 400oC.  A true 
trajectory for this regime could not be drawn in Fig. 4 due to limited data points.  
However, if the critical load ratio were set equal to 0.7 for the high R-ratio regime 
of Condition H900 at 400oC, the data of R = 0.6 and 0.7 could then be used to find 
a virtual ΔK*-K*max trajectory.  It would be expected that this virtual trajectory 
would be significantly deviated from the ideal fatigue line and located much 
closer to the K*max-axis, as compared to those trajectories given in Fig. 4.  The 
expecting trend of this virtual trajectory provides a clue that there might exist a 
superimposed monotonic fracture mode at a higher Kmax [15,18].  The proposed 
monotonic fracture mode for the current case is a crystallographic-faceted mode, 
in which Kmax plays a major role [15].  FCG occurs crystallographically along 
slip planes in the faceted mode, particularly in planar-slip materials [21].  As a 
peak-aged condition that contains coherent precipitates in the matrix, Condition 
H900 has the highest intensity of planar slip among the three given heat-treated 
conditions tested at 400oC [10,11,22].  Features of the crystallographic-faceted 
fracture mode were indeed observed on the fracture surfaces of high-load-ratio 
specimens of Condition H900 at 400oC, as exemplified in Fig. 5.  Therefore, the 
crystallographic-faceted fracture mode was considered as the primary crack 
growth mechanism for Condition H900 at 400oC under high R-ratios.  Such a 
fracture surface morphology was somewhat different from that of Condition 
H1150 tested at 400 and 500oC, as exemplified in Fig. 6.  Note that the crack 
growth direction in both Figs. 5 and 6 is from left to right.

As shown in Fig. 4, the trajectory for Condition A at 400oC was progressively 
deviated from the ideal fatigue line with an increase in K*max.  Its lower slope 
value suggests an increasing influence of a Kmax-controlling mechanism at high

High-Temperature Fatigue Crack Growth Behavior of 17-4 PH Stainless 
Steels at Various Load Ratios 
 
C.-K. Lin, K.-C. Hsu 
Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Central University, 
Jhong-Li 32001, Taiwan 
 
 
The high-temperature fatigue crack growth (FCG) behavior at 400 and 500oC was 
investigated for variously heat-treated 17-4 PH stainless steels under different 
load ratios.  Results indicated the FCG rates (FCGRs) at 400oC increased with R-
ratio at the low ΔK regime and merged together at the high ΔK regime for all the 
given heat-treated conditions, except for a peak-aged condition.  At 500oC, the 
FCGRs of the given alloys increased with R-ratio at low R-ratios and became 
comparable at high R-ratios.  The variations of FCGR with R-ratio could be 
described as an intrinsic FCG behavior based on a Unified Approach.  
Accordingly, the predominant FCG mechanism was similar to a general plastic 
blunting process except for the high R-ratio regime of the peak-aged condition 
tested at 400oC. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
As a type of martensitic precipitation-hardening stainless steel, 17-4 PH alloy has 
been used extensively in various applications, such as nuclear, chemical, aircraft, 
and naval industries [1].  A wide range of mechanical properties can be obtained 
for the 17-4 PH stainless steel through suitable heat treatments in the temperature 
range of 482-621oC (900-1150oF) [1-6].  Maximum strength and hardness values 
are generally obtained after aging at 450-510oC, during which coherent copper-
rich precipitate clusters are formed [1-3].  Aging at higher temperatures (above 
540oC) leads to formation of large, incoherent copper-rich precipitates which 
result in a lower strength and hardness and an enhancement of toughness [1-3].  
As many applications of the 17-4 PH stainless steel are involved with high 
temperatures, it is important to characterize the high-temperature fatigue behavior 
of the 17-4 PH alloy to better predict the service life of components made from 
this material.  Although there are some studies [7-11] focused on the high-
temperature fatigue behavior of 17-4 PH stainless steels, there is lack of 
consideration of the effects of load ratio (R-ratio, R = Pmin/Pmax) on the fatigue 
crack growth (FCG) behavior of such steels.  As part of a series of studies on the 
high-temperature fatigue and mechanical properties of 17-4 PH stainless steels [7-
12], the aim of this study is to investigate the influence of R-ratio on the high-
temperature FCG behavior of such alloys at 400 and 500oC. 
 
2. Experimental Procedures 
 
The 17-4 PH stainless steels used in the present work were supplied by the vendor 
in the form of hot-rolled, solution-annealed plates.  The chemical composition of 
11 
curves merged together at the higher ΔK regime, especially for those at higher R-
ratios ( )3.0≥R .  A similar trend was observed for FCGRs of Condition H900 at 
400oC (Fig. 1(b)) under 5.0≤R , but the FCGRs were increased again with R-
ratio at higher R-ratios (R > 0.5) for the entire ΔK regime.  For Condition H1150 
at 500oC (Fig. 1(d)), the FCGRs were increased with R-ratio at lower R-ratios ( )3.0≤R  for the entire ΔK regime and became comparable with each other at 
higher R-ratios ( )3.0≥R .

Fig. 1  Comparisons of FCGR curves under different load ratios at 400 and 500oC. 
 
An approach, called the “Unified Approach,” for considering the effect of R-ratio 
on FCG behavior was applied to describe the FCG behavior observed in the 
current study.  Such an approach has been described in many studies by 
Vasudevan, Sadananda, and co-workers (e.g., [13-19]).  It is assumed that for a 
fatigue crack to advance at a certain crack growth rate, two critical stress intensity 
13 
= 0.6 and 0.7) were observed, as shown in Fig. 3.  As specified by the Unified 
Approach, data points deviated from the L-shape curve indicate that a different 
crack growth mechanism might take place at that specific regime [19].  The 
FCGR data for Condition H900 at 400oC can then be divided into two regions, R 
= 0.1-0.5 and R ≥ 0.6, with each region having an individual crack growth 
mechanism with its own ΔK* and K*max [19].  Therefore, the FCG behavior of 
Condition H900 at 400oC was thought to have two controlling crack growth 
mechanisms, one dominating at the low R-ratio regime and the other dominating 
at the high R-ratio regime.  In this regard, the ΔK* and K*max values for the low R-
ratio regime of Condition H900 at 400oC were determined by using the 
aforementioned procedures with the data of R = 0.1-0.5.  However, due to the 
limited data points at R = 0.6 and 0.7, the ΔK* and K*max values for the high R-
ratio regime of Condition H900 at 400oC could not be completely determined.

3.2 Effects of R-ratio on fatigue crack growth mechanism 
 
15 
these conditions are merged to a line parallel to the ideal fatigue line.  Note that 
the differences in FCGR could not be shown in the trajectory map; similar 
trajectories only indicate similar crack growth mechanisms but not similar FCGRs.  
Therefore, such converged trajectories for Condition H1150 at 400 and 500oC and 
for the low R-ratio regime of Condition H900 at 400oC presumably represent a 
baseline crack growth mechanism of 17-4 PH alloy at high temperature. 
 
As described above, a different crack growth mechanism might take place at the 
high R-ratio regime (R = 0.6 and 0.7) of Condition H900 at 400oC.  A true 
trajectory for this regime could not be drawn in Fig. 4 due to limited data points.  
However, if the critical load ratio were set equal to 0.7 for the high R-ratio regime 
of Condition H900 at 400oC, the data of R = 0.6 and 0.7 could then be used to find 
a virtual ΔK*-K*max trajectory.  It would be expected that this virtual trajectory 
would be significantly deviated from the ideal fatigue line and located much 
closer to the K*max-axis, as compared to those trajectories given in Fig. 4.  The 
expecting trend of this virtual trajectory provides a clue that there might exist a 
superimposed monotonic fracture mode at a higher Kmax [15,18].  The proposed 
monotonic fracture mode for the current case is a crystallographic-faceted mode, 
in which Kmax plays a major role [15].  FCG occurs crystallographically along slip 
planes in the faceted mode, particularly in planar-slip materials [21].  As a peak-
aged condition that contains coherent precipitates in the matrix, Condition H900 
has the highest intensity of planar slip among the three given heat-treated 
conditions tested at 400oC [10,11,22].  Features of the crystallographic-faceted 
fracture mode were indeed observed on the fracture surfaces of high-load-ratio 
specimens of Condition H900 at 400oC, as exemplified in Fig. 5.  Therefore, the 
crystallographic-faceted fracture mode was considered as the primary crack 
growth mechanism for Condition H900 at 400oC under high R-ratios.  Such a 
fracture surface morphology was somewhat different from that of Condition 
H1150 tested at 400 and 500oC, as exemplified in Fig. 6.  Note that the crack 
growth direction in both Figs. 5 and 6 is from left to right.
