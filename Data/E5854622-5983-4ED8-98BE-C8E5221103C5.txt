Abstract
Ethoxy-4-nitrobenzene was synthesized by the reaction of
4-chloronitrobenzene with potassium ethoxide in a homogeneous system using
benzyltriethylammonium chloride (QCl) as a phase-transfer catalyst at 50℃
under ultrasound irradiation conditions. The use of phase-transfer catalysts and
ultrasound has been compared and demonstrated in this nucleophilic substitution
reactions. The kinetics of the reaction depends on the effect of amount of catalyst,
4synthetic manipulations constitutes a major chemical research effort. In this regard,
several non-conventional methods are emerging that involve reactions in aqueous
media [21,22] or those that are accelerated by exposure to microwave [23-26] or
ultrasound irradiation [27-30]. These methods are now recognized as viable
environmentally benign alternatives [23–30].
Ethers are commercially attractive because of their extensive applications in the
fine chemicals industry, such as anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic drugs
[31], ecologically clean additives to motor oils, non-toxic and high-octane gasoline
additives [32-34], plasticizer [35], and perfumery [36]. The primary purpose of this
work is to improve the etherification of p-chloronitrobenzene under ultrasound
condition (28 kHz; 200 W) along with ethanol, potassium hydroxide,
benzyltriethylammonium chloride in an homogenous medium. The reaction is greatly
enhanced by adding a small quantity of phase-transfer catalyst under ultrasound
irradiation conditions. Kinetics of the nucleophilic substitution of
p-chloronitrobenzene with potassium ethoxide (in situ preparation), including the
effect of amount of catalyst, agitation speed, amount of potassium hydroxide, amount
of ethanol, quaternary ammonium salts, temperature and ultrasound frequency on the
conversion were investigated in detail.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Ethanol, potassium hydroxide, p-chloronitrobenzene, quaternary ammonium
salts; benzyltriethylammonium chloride (BTEAC), benzyltriethylammonium bromide
(BTEAB), tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate (TBAHS), tetrabutylammonium
chloride (TBAC), tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB), tetrabutylammonium iodide
(TBAI), 18-Crown-6 (18-C-6) and other reagents were all guaranteed grade (GR)
61 ml ethylacetate. The contents of the test tube was shaken well for two minutes and
allowed to stand until the phases clearly separated from each other. A 1μl aliquot of
the organic layer was analyzed by Gas Chromatography (GC–Shimadzu 17 A model).
The analyzing conditions were as follows: Column, 30 m x 0.525 mm i.d. capillary
column containing 100% poly(dimethyl siloxane); injection temperature, 250℃;
detector, flame ionization detector (300℃). Yields were determined from standard curve
and using nonane as internal standard. We used 28 kHz (200 W) ultrasonic wave for the
kinetic study of this reaction [37]. In addition, the aqueous solution in the sample vial was
also analyzed and no p-chloronitrobenzene was detected. Notably, the sampling technique
is reproducible.
2.4. Reaction kinetics and mechanism
In this work, the aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction between
p-chloronitrobenzene and ethoixde ion were exployed in the presence of phase-transfer
catalyst namely benzyltriethylammonium chloride (QCl) and ultrasonic waves 28 kHz
(200 W). The ultrasonic waves enhance the rate of the reaction which is discussed in
section 3. The reaction mechanism is represented in Scheme 1.

82.5. Definition
The conversion (X) of p-chloronitrobenzene, (ArCl) is defined as follows:
[ArCl]o
X = 1 － (1)
[ArCl]o,i
where [ArCl]o,i and [ArCl]o represent the concentration of p-chloronitrobenzene at
time (t) t = 0 and t ＞ 0, respectively.
2.6. Rate expression
The rate expression for this reaction may be expressed as:
-rArCl = kapp [ArCl]o (2)
where kapp is the apparent reaction rate constant.
This reaction is carried out in a batch reactor, so the diminution rate of ArCl with
time (t) can be expressed as:
-d[ArCl]o
= -rArCl = kapp [ArCl] (3)
dt
on integrating the equation (3) yields:
[ArCl]o
－ln ( ) = － ln (1－X) = kapp t (4)
[ArCl]o,i
Using Eq (4), we can get the kapp value experimentally by plotting －ln (1－X)
against time (t).
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Effect of varying stirring Speeds
The effect of varying stirring speed on the rate of aromatic nucleophilic
10
reaction rate decreased (Fig.3.), it may be due to the catalytic decomposition at higher
KOH concentration as well as salting out effect [39].
In the study of phenoxide allylation in a phase-transfer catalytic system, Wu and
Lai [40] observed that the extraction of phenol (using PTC) is more effective if the
base concentration in the aqueous alkaline solution is higher. In a kinetic study [41] of
the synthesis of 4-bromophenyl allyl ether by PTC, KOH is used as a base rather than
NaOH, as KOH enhances the reaction rate. In this case the same trend was observed
i.e., KOH increases the kapp value (24.2 x 10-3 min-1) whereas NaOH decreases the kapp
value (4.6 x 10-3 min-1) of same concentration. Hence, we used KOH as a base for this
reaction.
3.3. Effect of the amount of BTEAC
This work also investigates the effect of the amount of benzyltriethylammonium
chloride (BTEAC) on the conversion of p-chloronitrobenzene. As shown in Fig.4, the
conversion is low when the reaction was carried out in the absence of BTEAC.
However, the reaction rate is dramatically enhanced when BTEAC was added to the
reaction solution. Furthermore, the conversion is increased with an increase in the
amount of BTEAC from 0.05 g to 0.4 g. The rate constants are almost linearly
dependent on the amount of catalyst used in each reaction (Table 3, Fig.4). So, the
sonication along with phase-transfer catalyst, the kapp value increases which may be
due to induce the change in size, and morphology of phase-transfer catalyst [28].
3.4. Effect of quaternary ammonium salts
Quaternary ammonium salts are generally used as phase-transfer catalysts to
promote reaction rate. In addition to BTEAC, five other quaternary ammonium salts,
such as BTEAB, THAHS, TBAC, TBAB, and TBAI, were investigated to test their
reactivity of the anion, CH3CH2O-, depends on its degree of solvation and on the
structure of its counter cation. Along with quaternary ammonium salts 18-Crown-6
12
results are shown in Fig.8. It is obvious that the reactivity is increased with an increase in
the temperature along with ultrasonic effect [43]. The reaction is that the number of
reactant molecules, which possess larger activated energy at a higher temperature and thus
the ultrasonic wave easily passes through the reactor. Thus the conversion is increased. The
other point is that the collision of the reactants at higher temperature is also increased.
Hence, the reaction rate is increased at higher temperature. Therefore, as shown in Fig.8,
the apparent rate constant increased with an increase in the temperature. The energy of
activation is calculated from the Arrhenius plot (Fig.9) which is 11.22 kcal mol-1.
3.7. Effect of the sonication
In the present work we also investigates the effect of ultrasound on the conversion of
p-chloronitrobenzene. Ultrasound has been found to enhance this aromatic nucleophilic
substitution reaction. The chemical effects of ultrasound attributed to intense local
conditions generated due to cavitation bubble dynamics, i.e., the nucleation, formation,
disappearance, and coalescence of vapour or gas bubbles in the ultrasonic field [21, 30,
44-58]. However in phase-transfer catalyst reaction rate enhancements are typically due to
mechanical effects, mainly through an enhancement in mass transfer. The presence of
ultrasound, a number of phase-transfer catalyzed reactions have also been shown to benefit
from the mass transport enhancement by sonication [57]. The employment of sonication
techniques for chemical synthesis has also attracted considerable interest in recent year
[58]. The reason is that this technology can enhance the selectivity and reactivity, increase
the chemical yields and shorten the reaction time. Recently, many studies have reported a
dramatic rate increase in phase-transfer catalysis under ultrasound irradiation [57, 59 - 63].
In our experiments the ultrasonic bath, model L-400 was used. It is consisted of
two layers stainless steel body. The internal dimensions of then ultrasonic cleaner tank
is 340 mm x 250 mm x 250 mm with liquid holding capacity of 22 liter. The external
tank size is 350 mm x 355 mm x 410 mm. We used water as a liquid in the ultrasonic
14
respect to the p-chloronitrobenzene. The reaction rate increased with increasing
temperature, catalyst amount and the frequency of ultrasonic wave. Nevertheless,
there is an optimum value of the potassium hydroxide amount to promote the yield or
to enhance the reaction rate. The apparent activation energy obtained is 11.22 kcal
mol-1.

Abstract
Electrochemical oxidation of catechol has been studied in the presence of
secondary amine as nucleophile in aqueous solution with various pH values using
cyclic voltammetry. Cyclic voltammetry of catechol in pure buffered solution pH 7.2
shows one anodic and corresponding cathodic peak which relates to the
transformation of catechol to corresponding o-benzoquinone and vice versa within a
quasi reversible two electron transfer process. Also, a little amount of o-benzoquinone
undergoes polymerization reaction. Cyclic voltammogram of catechol in the presence
of nucleophilic amines, show one anodic peak in the first scan of potential but on the
reverse scan the corresponding cathodic peak disappear and new peak is observed at
less positive potential. In the second scan of potential also a new anodic peak is
34
diethylamine and piperidine as representative of secondary aliphatic amines.
2. Experimental
All reagents were obtained from Fluka and used without further purification. All
solutions and subsequent dilutions were prepared using double-distilled water. All
experiments were carried out in phosphate buffer (pH 7.2).
The voltammetric experiments were performed using an Jiehan 5000
Electrochemical workstation (Taiwan) coupled with a Pentium Ⅲ personal computer
with a standard three electrode configuration. Glassy carbon disk (Metrohm, diameter
1.8 mm) served as working electrode; a platinum wire electrode provided the counter
electrode with Ag/AgCl/KCl (3 M) reference electrode completing the cell assembly.
The glassy carbon electrode was polished between each set of experiments with
aluminium oxide powder on a polishing cloth. All experiments were conducted at 25
℃ using water thermostat circulator.
3. Result and Discussion
3.1. Electrochemical Behavior of Catechol
Electrochemical properties of catechol studied by cyclic voltammetry method.
Cyclic voltammograms (subsequent cycles) of 1mM catechol in aqueous solution
containing 0.5 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at scan rate of potential 50 mVs-1 is
shown in Figure 1. As can be seen, at the first scan of potential, there is only one
anodic peak related to oxidation of catechol to o-benzoquinone and one corresponding
cathodic peak related to reduction of o-benzoquinone to catechol with half-wave
potential, E1/2 (=(Epa + Epc)/2) equal to 0.17 V vs. Ag/Agcl/KCl (3 M). The peak
separation potential, △E (=Epa–Epc) is about 100 mV, showing a quasi-reversible
behavior of a two-electron two-proton process.
36
investigated using cyclic voltammetry. The anodic oxidation of catechol result in
formation of o-benzoquinone, the later may be attacked by nucleophile. In the absence
of amines a few percent of o-benzoquinone polymerizes and results in appearance of a
new redox peak in cyclic voltammograms. In the presence of amines a nucleophilic
addition occurs and increasing the amines concentrations reduces polymer formation
which can be neglected. In this condition it can be deduced that the nucleophilic
addition of secondary aliphatic amines occurs through ECE mechanism.
