Abstract. A full field phase detection system for surface plasmon resonance (SPR) bio-sensor is 
presented. The phase difference variation between s and p polarization resulting from the SPR was 
detected by the polarization interferometry. In the polarization interferometry, the light reflected 
from the SPR sensor was divided into four phase quardrature parts by polarization components. By 
means of an algorithm similar to phase shifting interferometry, the phase distribution of SPR 
bio-sensor was obtained. We have successfully detected the phase difference variation with 0.07º 
resolution within 1×1 mm2 full field range. The corresponding detection limit of the refractive index 
change is about 1×10-7.

Introduction 
Traditional biochemical analysis or biomolecular detection often relies on fluorescence 
microscopy, which can provide high throughput screening. However, the detection process of 
fluorescence microscopy is quite time-consuming, so that it is hard to do real-time measurement. 
Recently, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) [1-4] with optical phase detection technique has 
emerged as an important and powerful biochemical analysis tool, because SPR is label-free and has 
high sensitivity to the surface effect. Several methods have been proposed to image the full field 
phase of the excitation of SPR, such as the phase shifting interferometry (PSI)[1]. Nevertheless, 
conventional PSI is too easily affected by surrounding noise, such as mechanical vibration, because 
of the non-common-path optical configuration. 
In this paper, a full field polarization interferometer (PI) [5-7] is developed to image the optical 
phase of SPR bio-sensor. Our measurement system includes an expanded collimated laser source, a 
SPR bio-sensor, and a PI. The collimated linear polarized light reflected from the SPR bio-sensor is 
sent to the PI, in which some optical components (e.g., beam splitters and polarizers) divide the light 
into four phase quardrature parts. These four phase quardrature light beams are used to estimate the 
optical phase resulting from SPR. Because our PI has a common-path optical configuration, our 
method can get rid of the surrounding noise. So far, we have successfully observed the local phase 
difference, which resulted from the surface effect of difference materials within 1×1 mm2 full field 
range. If only the electronic noise is considered, the measurement resolution of the refractive index of 
our system is estimated to be 1×10-7 RIU (Refractive Index Unit).  
Principle  
The SPR's Kretschmann configuration is shown in Fig. 1. According to SPR theory [1,2,8], the 
reflection coefficient rp,s of the p and s polarization are complex and can be expressed as 
ap,s×exp(iφp,s). ap,s is the real part of rp,s. φp and φs are respectively the phase of the p and s polarization 
coming from the reflection at the boundary surface under the conditions of SPR. A lot of studies [1-4] 
indicate that the phase difference φ (=φp -φs) is strongly dependent on the refractive index change 
  
Experiments and discussion 
The SPR's bio-sensor with full field phase detection system (Kretschmann configuration) is shown 
in Fig. 1. The bio-sensor base consists of a BK7 prism which is coated with 50 nm gold film and 
linker. The probe DNA is mechanically spotted on the one side of the bio-sensor base. The refractive 
indexes in the areas with and without probe DNA are different. A diode laser with wavelength 785 
nm was used as a light source. To enhance the measured phase difference between the areas with and 
without probe DNA, the incident angle was chosen at resonant angle by determining the minimum 
reflectance. The four quardrature interference intensities in 1×1 mm2 area were detected by these four 
CCD1~4. By means of the algorithm as mentioned above, the optical phase distribution of the 
bio-sensor is obtained and shown in Fig. 3(a). Fig. 3(b) demonstrates the spatial phase variation of a 
line cut from Fig. 3(a). The phase difference between the areas with and without probe DNA is about 
25º.  
We also examined the system stability for about 20 min, and found that the measured phase still 
suffered from a lot of noises. The noise may result from the unstable opto-mechanical system. For 
example, the background vibration causes the variation of the incident angle; the thermal drift makes 
the refractive index change and so on. If only considering the electronic high frequency noise, the 
standard deviation of the phase noise is about 0.07°. If we take the standard deviation of the phase 
noise as the phase resolution, from the curve's slope (~ 5×105 º/RIU) in Fig. 2, we have the detection 
limit of 1×10-7 (~ 0.07/5×105) RIU.  
Conclusions 
A full field phase detection system for surface plasmon resonance (SPR) bio-sensor with the 
polarization interferometry is presented. The light reflected from the SPR sensor was divided into 
four phase quardrature parts in the polarization interferometry. By means of the similar algorithm to 
phase shifting interferometry, the phase difference variation resulted from SPR was obtained. We 
have successfully detected the phase difference variation with 0.07º resolution within 1×1 mm2 full 
field range. The corresponding detection limit of the refractive index change is about 1×10-7.

Optics Communications 276detecting scheme has been developed using the surface
plasmon resonance (SPR) method. It is based on the
monitoring of changes in the refractive index (RI) on the
surface of biomolecular interfaces or inside the solution
[1–3]. The SPR technique provides ultra high resolution
for the detection of tiny changes in the RI or other quanti-
ties which can be converted into equivalent RI. The SPR
techniques have also been widely applied to the measure-
ment of temperature [4], pressure [5], displacement [6],
angle [7], and so on.
In early SPR techniques, changes in the refractive
not good enough for today’s precise biochemical analysis
requirements. On the contrary, as the SPR is excited, the
optical phase will vary much more abruptly than the
reﬂectance [10,11]. Several methods have been proposed
to measure the phase of the SPR excitation, for example
phase shifting interferometry (PSI) [12,13], and hetero-
dyne interferometry (HI) [3,6,7]. Kabashin et al. [14]
devised a Mach–Zehnder interferometer based on an
SPR technique for sensing RI change. A test sample
was placed on one path of a Mach–Zehnder interferom-
eter. There was no phase shifting device in their system.interferometry, can be used to estimate the refractive index change. In the experimental results we obtain a phase stability of 0.07, and a
resolving power for the refractive index of 6 · 106 RIU. This method has the advantages of a simple optical setup, being easier to oper-
ate in real time, and low cost. In addition, due to the common-path arrangement, our method can also eliminate the surrounding noise.

and the experimental scheme, as shown in Fig. 2. The opti-
cal conﬁguration belongs to the common-path type. That
is, the p and s polarized lights always propagate with the
same path. As mentioned, the SPR eﬀect results in the
phase diﬀerence (/p  /s) between the s and p polarized
lights. In the following optical path, the quarter-wave-plate
Q adds a 90 phase diﬀerence to these polarized lights. The
beam-splitter BS and the polarization beam-splitters PBS
divide the light into four parts; these four light beams are
then detected by four photodetectors. According to the
Jones calculation, the four signals have the phases of 0,
90, 180 and 270, respectively. Two signals with phase
quadrature are obtained by subtracting the signal with a
phase of 180 from the signal of 0 and the signal with
phase 270 from the signal of 90 [20]. The mathematical
derivation is discussed below.
For convenience, the +z-axis is chosen to follow the
direction of light propagation and the +x-axis is along
the horizontal plane. A linear polarized light beam Ein
whose polarization is oriented at an angle of a with respect
to the x axis is incident at hi onto the interface between the
prism and the thin gold ﬁlm. The Jones vector of the
reﬂected light from the SPR is

This reﬂected light is guided into the phase detection sys-
tem (PDS), which consists of a quarter-wave-plate Q, a
beam-splitter BS, two polarization beam-splitters PBS1,2,
four photodetectors D1–4, two diﬀerence ampliﬁers DA1,2,
an analog-to-digital converter ADC, and a personal com-

are 1: Q! BS! PBS1 (45)! D1; 2: Q! BS! PBS1
(45)! D3; 3: Q! BS! PBS2 (0)! D2; and 4:
Q! BS! PBS2 (90)! D4. If the fast axis of the quar-
ter-wave-plate Q is at 45 with respect to the x-axis, then
