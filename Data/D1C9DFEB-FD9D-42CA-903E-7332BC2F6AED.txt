Abstract: We have investigated and experimentally demonstrated high-power and stable
C-band and L-band erbium-doped fiber amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) sources using
multipumping configuration, which can provide an output power of 27.16 dBm (519.99 mW)
and 27.34 dBm (542.01 mW) with a power ripple of 5.9 and 1.1 dB for C-band and L-band
without adding any external spectra-flattening components. Moreover, the averaged power
stability of C-band and L-band erbium-doped fiber ASE source with 0.005 and 0.003 dB
during 8-hour interval measurement at the room temperature 25 oC can be achieved, allowing
high pumping efficiency of 38.5 and 36.9%.
1. Introduction
High-power and stable erbium-doped fiber (EDF) amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) source
has been intensively studied as an essential source for optical coherence tomography [1] and
spectrum-sliced wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) passive optical network application [2,
3]. However, most of the investigations have been carried out to study ASE sources of <200 mW
(23 dBm) with the fiber grating-based and fiber-mirror configurations under specific designs
[4-6], which also take the advantage of EDF as the gain medium to amplify the feedback
wavelength in both of the conventional wavelength band (C-band) and the long wavelength band
(L-band).
In this paper, we proposed high-power and stable EDF C-band and L-band ASE sources
using multipumping configuration, which can provide an output power of 27.16 dBm (519.99
mW) and 27.34 dBm (542.01 mW) with a power ripple of 5.9 and 1.1 dB for C-band and L-band
without adding any external spectra-flattening components. The high pumping efficiency and
excellent power stability for 8-hour interval measurements at the room temperature 25 oC have
also experimental confirmations for the predictions of resonant lasing relaxing in the proposed
configuration.
2. Experiments and Discussions
The experimental configurations for high-power and stable erbium-doped fiber ASE sources are
as shown in Figures 1(a) and 1(b). Figure 1(a) shows the proposed C-band erbium-doped fiber
Figure 2 Optimum output spectra of (a) C-band and (b) L-band EDF ASE sources.
Figure 2 illustrates the optimum output spectra of the C-band EDF ASE source pumped by
980-nm pumping LD1, LD2, and LD3 with 450 mW as well as the L-band EDF ASE source by
980-nm pumping LD1 with 120 mW, LD2, LD3, and LD4 with 450 mW, which are measured by
an optical spectrum analyzer (OSA) with 1.0-nm resolution and 20-dB optical attenuation. Power
ripples (Pr) measured for C-band and L-band ASE sources in Figures 2(a) and 2(b) were 5.9 and
1.1 dB, respectively. The total output power was 27.16 dBm (519.99 mW) and 27.34 dBm
(542.01 mW) for C-band and L-band ASE sources, allowing a pumping efficiency of 38.5 and
36.9%.
Figure 3 Output L-band ASE spectra without adding (a) optical isolator ISO1 and (b) ISO2.
We also have measured the output L-band ASE spectra without adding optical isolator ISO1
and ISO2 when pumped by 980-nm pumping LD2, LD3, and LD4 with 450 mW and pumping
LD1 with 120 mW, as shown in Figures 3(a) and 3(b), respectively. Such a lasing effect occurs in
the cases owing to the strong feedback generated by EDF2 and EDF3. On the contrary, the
optimum case with adding optical isolators ISO1 and ISO2 not only restricted the resonant lasing
effect but also provided more stable output power.
