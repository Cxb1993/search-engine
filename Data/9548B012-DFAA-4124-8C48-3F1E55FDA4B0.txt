distributions of the rotary exchanger.  (Skeipko, 1987)
studied the effect of matrix longitudinal heat conduc-
tion on the temperature fields of gases and matrices,
and solved the system of energy conservation equa-
tions by the analytical method of separating variables.
(Attia and D’Silva, 1983) presented a mathematical
model that considers the rotor circumferential conduc-
tion effect.
Figure 1 shows a traditional regenerative air
preheater with two channels (Nag, 2002), (Weisman
and Eckart, 1985) and (El-Wakil, 1984).  The gas and
air flow in one channel each.  The object discussed
in the above studies is this traditional type, which only
has two flow channels.  During a rotation period, the
rotor matrix passes through the gas and air sides, with
only one time heat exchange.  Therefore, if the rotor
matrix, having absorbed heat from the flue gas, is
passing through the air side, then the temperature of
the rotor matrix near the exit and the segment of chan-
nel interface might fall.  Thus, the heat transfer be-
tween this rotor matrix and the fluid is very small,
producing a low-effectiveness region (shown in Fig.
1) of heat exchange.  A similar phenomenon also hap-
pens on the gas side.  Improving this phenomenon
can increase effectiveness.  Hence, this study con-
siders changing the flow to four channels (as illus-
trated in Fig. 2).  The rotor matrix passes through four
channels of gas and air during a period of rotation,
leading to two heat exchanges.
II. THE GOVERNING EQUATIONS AND
ASSUMPTIONS
The governing differential equations for the
simulation of heat transfer in a regenerative air
preheater with a nonhygroscopic rotor matrix mate-
rial have the following idealizations and assumptions:
(1) The fluids pass in counterflow directions.
(2) The thermal conductivities of the preheater ma-
trix are finite in all directions:  the direction of
fluid-flow (longitudinal direction), the direction
of rotor matrix (circumferential direction) and the
direction normal to both the fluid and metal flow
(radial direction).
(3) The thermal properties of the two fluids and the
matrix material remain constant with regard to
temperature and time.
(4) The fluids do not mix as a result of either direct
leakage or carry over.
(5) The convective heat transfer coefficients, and thus
the convective conductance between the fluids
and the matrix, are constant with flow length.
(6) The temperatures of the entering fluid are con-
stant with time over the flow inlet cross sections.
(7) There is no convective heat exchange at the fluid
entry or exit cross sections.
(8) No heat is transferred between the preheater and
its surroundings.
(9) Regular periodic conditions are established for all
matrix elements, (i.e., steady-state operation).
Based on these assumptions, the differential
equations and boundary conditions governing the heat
transfer in the rotary gas air preheater can be ex-
pressed as Cgas on the gas side and Cair on the air
side.

III. SOLUTION METHOD
The computer program developed to solve the
governing differential equations is based on the fi-
nite difference method, represented by Gauss-Seidel
iterative procedures.  The three-dimensional staggered
nodal represents the regenerative air preheater shown
in Fig. 4.  Figs. 5 and 6 indicate the plane of the y-θ
and r-θ staggered mesh.  The governing differential
equations are written as follows.  Additionally, the
equations were obtained by discretizing the govern-
ing equations with upwind difference for convective
terms and central difference for conduction terms.  For
the convenience of writing the program, the temperatures
of both fluid streams are represented by just one variable
–T i, j, k in finite difference form, where j = 1, 2, ..., Jx
for the side of Cgas, and j = Jx + 1, Jx + 2, ..., Jx + Jn
for the side of Cair.  Additionally, 
–T ri, j, k denotes the
rotor matrix temperatures.  The finite difference equa-
tions can be rearranged as follows

by column from inner circle to outer circle.
For each circle, the local temperature distri-
butions are computed over a complete circle
at different radii, from the side of Cgas to the
side of Cair.  The rotor temperatures are con-
tinuous across the adjacency between the two
sides.  On the Cair side, the calculation direc-
tion is reversed in each column, and the finite
difference equations with boundary conditions
are adjusted as those for the Cair side.

of fluids at exits.

(2) [New(–T n, e)avg – Old (–T n, e)avg] < 5 × 10–5
(3) Heat balance error < 5 × 10–5
If the convergence and error criteria are satisfied,
then stop the computation and save the effectiveness.
Otherwise, go to step 5.

V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To determine accuracy, the effectiveness calcu-
lated by this method was compared with that of
(Bahnke and Howard, 1964).  Both methods produced
similar results when using the same number of sub-
divisions (I = Jx = Jn = K = 16) and convergence con-
ditions (5 × 10–5).  Therefore, the numerical solutions
in this study are accurate, and can be accepted.  The
results are shown in Table 1.
Figure 7 clearly indicates that the effectiveness
of the regenerative air preheater was increased by in-
creasing the number of the flow channels from 2 to 4
channels.
Figure 8 indicates that increasing the capacity
rate ratio of fluid streams (Cgas/Cair), while keeping a
constant capacity rate of rotor matrix (Cr) increases
the effectiveness.  Thereby, if enough waste energy
is produced, then the mass flow rate should be raised
to increase the effectiveness of the regenerative air
preheater.  The effectiveness of a heat exchanger is
defined as the ratio of the amount of actual heat transfer
