Research goal 
Designing new phosphorescent materials, such as iridium-based complexes, which 
possess both short excited-state lifetime and high quantum-yield may markedly 
enhance the efficiency of the organic light-emitting devices. However, different 
functional groups may consequently need to be introduced to the base molecules, and 
inevitably result in an increase in molecular weight, which will in turn make the 
resultant molecules difficult, if not at all impossible, to vacuum-evaporate. This will 
hence make solution process a must choice, especially when the molecular weight of 
employed materials is further increased.  
Wet-process is also a must requirement for large-area devices or roll to roll 
production.14 Polymer-based OLEDs can be fabricated via wet-processes. However, 
polymer materials exhibit disperse molecular-weight and are complex to purifty, 
causing the resultant devices to exhibit, frequently, a comparatively lower efficiency.      
   In contrary, small molecular materials possess high electroluminescent efficiency, 
but their low molecular weights will result to weak mechanical strength and 
undermine the film integrity and device lifespan. Hence, it is highly desirable to 
develop a molecular material with high electroluminescent character to exhibit high 
device efficiency as well as high molecular weight to achieve sufficient device 
robustness.

efficiency of 67 cd/A at 100 cd/m2 for a polymeric green OLED and 59 cd/A at 200 
cd/m2 for a molecular counterpart.25-26 Burn’s group reported 55 cd/A at 400 cd/m2 for 
a dendrimer-based OLED.27 
 
 
Research Method 
Device fabrication: The fabrication process included firstly the spin-coating at 
4,000 rpm of a 35 nm hole transporting layer of PEDOT：PSS on a pre-cleaned indium 
tin oxide anode. The second step was to spin-coat the phosphorescent red, green or 
blue emissive layer. The composing host and dye were first separatively dissolved in 
tetrahydrofuran. After complete dissolution, the resultant solutions were mixed to 
form a host solution uniformly dispersed with the desired doping dye. A 32 nm 
electron transporting layer was then deposited at 1×10-5 torr. Finally deposited were a 
0.8 nm lithium fluoride and a 150 nm aluminum cathode. 
Measurement: The OLEDs of luminance and CIE chromatic coordinates results 
were measured by using Minolta CS-100 luminance-meter. The lifetimes were 
obtained using a Minolta CS-1000S spectrophotometer. The highest occupied 
molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of the organic materials studied were 
calculated from their oxidation potentials measured by a cyclicvoltammetry, while the 
 6 
5-methyl-7-trifluoromethyl-5H-benzo[c][1,5]naphthyridin-6-one or 5-methyl-5H 
-benzo[c][1,5]naphthyridin-6-one to give the corresponding cyclometallated 
Ir(III)-µ-chloro-bridged dimers. Further reaction of the dimers with picolinic acid and 
sodium carbonate formed the desired iridium complex, CF3BNO or BNO.

Table I lists the physical characteristics of the novel blue-green guest, CF3BNO, 
and the other two comparing counterparts, BNO and tris(2-phenylpyridine) iridium 
(III) (Ir(ppy)3). The excited-state lifetimes were 0.30, 0.32 and 1.2µs for CF3BNO, 
BNO, and Ir(ppy)3, respectively. Comparing with that in Ir(ppy)3, the shorter 
 8 
emitter-composing device28. The high quantum yield in solution of CF3BNO should 
also favor the fabrication of a high-efficiency in device. 
The molecular weights were 869, 733, and 655 g/mol for CF3BNO, BNO, and 
Ir(ppy)3, respectively. The CF3BNO guest possesses the highest molecular weight, 
which would make it the most difficult to deposit by vacuum-evaporation, especially 
by realizing its decomposition temperature of 290 °C is comparatively low. 
The resultant CF3BNO was then fabricated into a blue-green OLED device 
mainly via solution-process due to its high molecular weight. To compare material 
characteristics, green OLED devices composed of BNO and Ir(ppy)3 were also 
fabricated via solution-process. The device architecture consisted of a 1,250 Å indium 
tin oxide layer, a 350 Å poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene)-poly-(styrenesulfonate) 
(PEDOT: PSS) hole-transporting layer, a 220 Å green emissive layer, a 320 Å 
1,3,5-tris(N-phenylbenzimidazol-2-yl)benzene (TPBi) electron-transporting layer, an 
8 Å lithium fluoride layer and a 1,500 Å aluminum layer, as shown in Figure 1. The 
employed host for the emissive layer was 4,4’-bis(carbazol-9-yl)biphenyl (CBP). A 
series of doping concentrations were studied for the resultant blue-green 
light-emitting CF3BNO as well as for the two comparing counterparts, BNO and 
Ir(ppy)3. The respective doping concentrations for achieving the highest power 
efficiency were 12.5, 10.0 and 12.5 wt% for CF3BNO, BNO, and Ir(ppy)3. To 
 10 
emission30. The resultant spectra of the Ir(ppy)3-composing counterpart peaks at 511 
nm, as typically observed in previous Ir(ppy)3-containing devices, indicating that 
energy-transfer from host to guest had effectively occurred and the hosts did not emit 
in the observation range. 
Figure 2(b) shows the lumminance result of the CF3BNO-composing device 
fabricated via wet-process comparing with those of the BNO-, Ir(ppy)3-composing 
counterparts. The CF3BNO-composing device exhibited the highest luminescence 
among the three devices, which may be due to that CF3BNO has both highest 
quantum-yield and shortest excited-state lifetime. High quantum-yield reflects to a 
strong self-luminescence due to a great amount of exciton generation on light-emitting 
molecules, and short excited-state lifetime reflects to a rapid transition of excitons 
from excited-state to ground-state, which in turn prevents an undesired 
triplet-triplet-annihilation of excitons on excited-state. These two characters lead to a 
great deal and effective exciton-photon generation on CF3BNO molecular. In contrary, 
although BNO has comparable excited-state lifetime with that of CF3BNO, its 
quantum yield is lower than half of that of CF3BNO, causing fewer exciton- 
generation and a much lower brightness the resultant device. Similarly, Ir(ppy)3 has 
both the lowest quantum-yield and the longest excited-state lifetime, causing the 
resultant device to exhibit the lowest brightness.

the CF3BNO-composing device via wet-process, comparing with those of the BNO-, 
Ir(ppy)3-composing devices. 
 
Figure 3(a) shows the current efficiency result of the CF3BNO-composing 
device via wet-process on the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) 
diagram, comparing with those of the BNO-, Ir(ppy)3-composing devices and the 
previously reported green ones via wet-process. The current efficiency versus current 
density of these three devices is shown in Figure 3(b). As seen, the 
CF3BNO-composing device via wet-process exhibited the highest current efficiency at 
all applied current densities than other wet-processed ones. At lower current density, 
such as 10-1 mA/ cm2 for example, its resultant current efficiency is 89.2 cd/A, 
corresponding to a luminance of 88 cd/m2. Whilst, the device efficiency was 59.4 
 14 
but only 41.1 cd/A via dry-process. The high molecular weight (733 g/mol) and low 
decomposition temperature (222 °C) of BNO would also make the film of BNO 
difficult to form via vacuum-evaporation.

reported green ones via wet-process on the (a) CIE diagram and (b) current density. 
Figure 3(c) shows the current efficiency of the CF3BNO-composing devices 
fabricated via wet- and dry-process, comparing with those of the BNO-, 
Ir(ppy)3-composing counterparts. 
 
Contrarily, Ir(ppy)3 had a comparatively lower molecular weight (655 g/mol) and 
a much higher decomposition temperature (395 °C), both of which make it much 
easier to be vacuum-deposited without damaging its molecular integrity. This would 
in turn result in a high efficiency for devices fabricated via dry-process, as typically 
 16 
in two possible hole injection ways. First, some of holes would inject into the host and 
then recombine with electrons to form excitons. Second, part of holes could inject into 
the guest and then hop into the host to form excitons. The excitons formed by these 
two ways on the host can favor energy-transfer from host to guest. Meanwhile, lesser 
excitons formed on guest would also prevent an undesired excessive excitons from 
causing quenching phenomenon, which would result in low device efficiency33. These 
two factors may partly explain why the CF3BNO-composing device exhibited the 
relatively high efficiency observed. In contrast, both carriers, electrons and holes, 
would be trapped on the guests of Ir(ppy)3 and BNO, because the LUMO of the guests 
(-3.0 eV) are lower than that of the host CBP (-2.9 eV) and their HOMO (-5.6 eV) are 
higher than that of the host (-6.0 eV). Trapping both electron and hole on guest would 
result in excessive excitons formed thereon, which would in turn cause 
efficiency-unfavorable exciton-quenching, resulting in low device efficiency. 
Compared with previous literatures, the CF3BNO-composing device exhibits an 
extraordinarily high-efficiency and a blue-green emission (Figure 3(a)). The EQE of 
which is as high as 23.6%, greater than the generally-accepted theoretical limit of 
20%34. However, Kido’s group has recently reported that the EQE of the OLEDs can 
reach 30~50% under the condition of out-coupling efficiency of 30~50% with IQE of 
100%35. Hence, the reasons why the CF3BNO-composing device shows such a high

Figure 4 shows the energy diagram of the devices with the two different hosts 
and chemical structures of the two hosts (BCO-CBP and CBP) and red guest 
(Ir(2-phq)3). The device consisted of a 125 nm indium tin oxide (ITO) layer, a 35 nm 
PEDOT:PSS hole-transporting layer, a 35 nm red emissive layer, a 32 nm 
1,3,5-tris(N-phenylbenzimi- dazol-2-yl)benzene (TPBi) electron-transporting layer, a 
0.7 nm lithium fluoride electron-injunction layer and a 150 nm aluminum layer. The 
emissive layer comprised a red-light-emitting guest, Ir(2-phq)3, and a novel host of 
BCO-CBP. Besides the novel BCO-CBP, a typical host, 4,4’-bis(carbazol-9-yl)- 
biphenyl (CBP), was also studied for comparison.

Table III. Electroluminescence characteristics of the blue devices with the two 
polymer hosts. 
 
    
The lower efficiency obtained by PVK-containing device may be attributed to the 
highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital 
(LUMO) values of PVK and FIrpic to be the same, causing over-injection of holes 
into the host. Furthermore, based on the LUMO values of PVK (2.2eV) and FIrpic 
(3.1eV), appears that FIrpic would trap electrons in PVK-containing device. Hence, 
PVK-containing device has poor charge injection balance38. On the other hand, the 
carriers of RS-12-containing device could effectively inject into the host rather than 
into the guest due to proper architecture design, as evidenced by higher current 
density shown in figure 7A39-40. Moreover, the high efficiency of the 
RS-12-containing device may be attributed to high external quantum efficiency shown 
in the inset of figure 7A. Figure 7B shows the resultant power efficiency of the two 
polymer devices. The RS-12-containing device shows much higher power efficiency 
than PVK-containing device at current density ranging from 0.01 to 1 mA/cm2.

Conclusion 
(A) A novel CF3BNO iridium complex with short excited-state-lifetime (0.30 µs) 
and relatively high quantum-yield (95%) was presented. With the use of CBP host, a 
blue-green OLED device with markedly high current efficiency of 89.1 cd/A (69.8 
lm/W)at 100 cd/m2 with CIE coordinates of (0.22, 0.51) was fabricated via 
solution-process. Besides the intrinsically good phosphorescence properties, the high 
efficiency may also be partly attributed to the device architecture, which enables 
excitons to form on host and hence favors efficiency-favorable energy-transfer from 
host to guest. 
(B) High power-efficiency red OLED of 18.6 lm/W at 100 cd/m2 was obtained via 
solution process by using a novel host of BCO-CBP. The markedly high efficiency 
may be attributed to the sterically hindered BCO-CBP that can alleviate the 
aggregation of the triplet emitter, which in turn reduce in the degrees of both 
triplet-triplet annihilation and self-quenching of the red dopant.  
   (C) High power efficiency of 20.3 lm/W, corresponding to a current efficiency of 36.1 
cd/A was obtained for a blue phosphorescent PLED using a novel polymer host 
RS-12.The markedly high efficiency may be attributed to the high external quantum 
efficiency of the RS-12 polymer host and the proper device architecture design.
