Abstract 
With the rapid development of 
three-dimensional (3D) modeling technique 
and Internet, 3D models are more and more 
widely used in industry product design, 
virtual reality, 3D games, education and 
video animation. With the yields and 
propagation of a large quantity of 3D 
models, a lot of time and labor is saved to 
find a similar model in database than 
redesigning a new model. 
In this Project, a novel 3D model shape 
description method is proposed. As a 3D 
model rotates, the approach studies the 
shape difference to human vision system, 
and then translates shape of the model into a 
one-dimensional statistic histogram. Thus 
shape feature is extracted. The new 
description method has following properties: 
generality; need not pose estimation; low 
computational complexity; robustness to 
noise; invariant to rotation; translation and 
scaling; good shape discriminating ability, 
etc. 
   We also make a deep study on 3D model 
retrieval techniques based on the presented 
 4
distributions representing frequency of 
occurrence. Ankerst et al. [4] subdivide the 
space into spherical shells and sectors 
around the center of gravity of an object; the 
resulting partitions correspond to the bins of 
3D shape histogram. Osada et al. [5] 
represent the shape signature as a 
probability distribution sampled from a 
shape function measuring the geometric 
properties of a 3D model. Ohbuchi et al. [6] 
improve Osada’s method by constructing 
2D histograms. Compared with other 
methods, statistic based methods are not 
only fast and easy to implement, but also 
have some desired properties, such as 
robustness and invariance. However, the 
discrimination ability of these methods is 
not good enough due to the fact that local 
shape features are not depicted explicitly. 
(3) Topology based methods. Besides 
geometric and physical properties, topology 
structure is another important characteristic 
for 3D shapes. Hilaga et al. [7] propose a 
topology-based method, in which 
Multiresolutional Reeb Graph is constructed 
by using a continuous function such as the 
geodesic distance. Siddiqi et al. [8] present a 
shape description based on shock graphs. 
Sundar et al. [9] describe a method that 
encodes the geometric and topological 
information in the form of a skeletal graph. 
Topology-based methods have properties of 
intuition, invariance and generality. 
However, they require a consistent model of 
the object’s boundary and interior, and a 
large amount of computational resources are 
needed to compute the skeleton.  
(4) Image based methods. The human 
vision system has an uncanny ability to 
recognize objects from a single view. On the 
basis of this idea, Christopher et al. [10] 
adopt a concept named aspect graph to 
group all views and represent a 3D model 
with a set of 2D views. Thus, 3D problems 
can be transformed to 2D problems. Pu et al. 
[11] represent 3D shape accurately by three 
views. In these methods, several thumbnail 
images must be computed beforehand. 
Generally, these methods are robust but 
time-consuming. 
3. Overview of the algorithm 
In general, 3D content is represented by 
3D mesh models, because of the simple and 
efficient visualization techniques supported, 
and performed in real time by most of the 
commercial graphic devices. Besides, other 
formats models can be easily converted into 
meshes using available 3D information 
processing software. Hence, this paper deals 
with the shape description of mesh models.  
Our approach is to represent 3D shape as 
a one-dimensional histogram. The 
motivation originates from such a question: 
As a 3D model rotates in the spatial domain, 
why the human vision system, from the 
fixed viewing position, is sensitive to aware 
that the shape after rotation differs from the 
initial shape (see Figure 1)? If points are 
sampled uniformly on the model surface, we 
notice that the orientation of normal vector 
of points is changed after rotation. As 
shown in Figure 2, regardless of the position

4. Proposed algorithm 
The proposed method consists of four 
steps as follows: 
Step 1. Sample points and compute 
normal vectors. For a triangulated mesh 
model, N random points are sampled 
uniformly on its surface. Let us assume si 
and k denote area of the triangle i and 
number of triangles, respectively. Then we 
can compute ni, namely the number of 
sample points on the triangle i with the 
Formula (1).

The normal vector of the point p is 
estimated by the normal of triangle ABC∆  
where p lies on, as shown in Formula (2). 
Hereto a mesh model is translated into a 
point set with orientations. Notice that the 
proposed method does not need to 
accurately determine position of random 
points, only needs to attain the normal 
orientations. Unlike this, positions of 
sample points must be obtained in Osada’s 
D2 [5] and Ohbuchi’s improvement [6]. 
Consequently computational complexity of 
our descriptor is smaller than [5] and [6]. 
Step 2. Rotate Models. In this step, the 
model is randomly rotated, controlled by α , 
β , γ , i.e. rotation angles relative to x, y, 
z-axes respectively. 
 
As shown in Formula (3), R is the general 
3D rotation matrix. When a 3D point p is 
rotated by R，p is transformed to p′，as 
shown in Formula (4). 
   Rpp =′      (4) 
Actually, we rotate a model in order to find 
the shape difference after rotation. This can 
be reduced to analyzing normal distributions 
on the unit sphere. Let us assume we rotate 
a model T times with T group of rotation 
angles; α, β, γ  are randomly selected in the 
range of [0, 2π ]. When rotating a model, 
the normal distribution of points is changed 
accordingly. 
 
Fig. 3 Rotate a triangle on the surface 
As shown in Figure 3, the triangle 
ABC∆  and point p are rotated to CBA ′′′∆  
and p′  respectively. Then pnr  and pn ′r  
have the relationship as shown in Formula 
(5). 
pp nRn
rr =′      (5) 
Step 3. Count Normal Distributions. As a 
model is rotated T times, we obtain T 
Gaussian spheres; each being distributed by 
N normal vectors. To analyze the 
distributions, we segment the surface of a 
Gaussian sphere into L sections.

similar histograms, while models in the 
different classes have dissimilar histograms. 
Experimental results show effectiveness of 
the proposed descriptor. 
6. Conclusions 
This project proposes a novel method 
based on rotation to characterize 3D shapes. 
Experimental results show its effective to 
discriminate different models. In order to 
improve the performance of our descriptor, 
a 2D histogram is constructed as shape 
features in the future work instead of 1D 
histogram, for in the 1D histogram, the 
positions information of sample points is not 
taken into account. In addition, the 
descriptor will be utilized in some specific 
applications such as 3D model retrieval, 3D 
object classification, 3D object recognition, 
etc. Due to the support from this project, 
one conference paper and four (SCI and EI) 
journal papers are published.

The evaluation and movement processes take turns 
to execute until the lifetime of the bacteria reach the 
limit, and then the reproduction process executes. In 
the process of reproduction, the whole population will 
only keep half of the bacteria, which perform better 
healthy values, and directly reproduce them to replace 
the bacteria with worse healthy values. Once the 
reproduction is done, the process goes back into the 
cycles of evaluation and movement for the reproduced 
bacteria.
When the reproduction times exceed the limit which 
user defined, the elimination-dispersal even takes part 
in the process. This process eliminates the bacteria 
with probability, if a bacterium is eliminated, a 
bacterium, which fits in with the initial conditions, is 
generated to replace the eliminated one. Then the 
whole processes described above repeat until all the 
process times are exceeded.

3. Genetic Algorithm 
GA is a well known algorithm for solving 
optimization problems. According to Darwin’s Theory, 
it takes the natural evolution’s model to find the 
optimal solution to the evaluative function. In other 
words, the GA-type algorithms search based on 
technique of natural selection and natural genetics. 
Basically, GA only defines the rules for users to solve 
their own optimization problems, not a fixed function, 
which means that the authors can easily apply GA into 
different applicative fields. 
To solve optimization problems by GA, like other 
optimization algorithms, the first step is to initialize the 
solution sets. In GA, we use chromosomes to represent 
the solutions in the solution space, and genes to 
indicate the value on all specific dimensions. 
Here we list the operation steps of GA below: 
1. Initiation: Generate a population of 
chromosomes, and randomly give them values 
for genes, which mean to put them into the 
solution space. 
2. Evaluation: In this step, all the chromosomes 
get a fitness value according to the 
calculations from the user defined fitness 
function. The fitness function exactly fits the 
problem of the solution space. And the 
chromosome, which has the best fitness value, 
will be kept as the best solution set. 
3. Selection: According to the selection rate, part 
of the chromosomes will be eliminated, and 
the other part of them will be kept. There are 
lots of methods to select some chromosomes 
to keep. And the most popular ways are 
random selection, roulette wheel selection, and 
essential selection. 
4. Crossover: This step forces the chromosomes 
to exchange the information they carried to the 
others via switching the information on parts 
of the dimensions. The popular crossover 
methods are one-site crossover, and two-site 
crossover.
5. Mutation: According to the mutation rate, 
several chromosomes will be selected from the 
population, and then randomly change the 
value of parts of the dimensions. This will 
give the population a larger chance to generate 
new species. For optimization, it is a chance to 
get an abrupt evolution. 
6. Termination Checking: GA repeats Step 2 to 
Step 5 until certain termination is met, such as 
pre-defined number of generation is reached, 
or it failed to have process for certain number 
of generations. Once terminated, GA reports 
the best chromosome it has during the course. 
4. Bacterial-GA Foraging 
According to the experiments, we notice that BF has 
higher local search ability than GA, but it is poor in 
global search while the solution space is huge. On the 
contrary, GA performs high capacity on global search, 
but it is difficult for GA to pinpoint the global best 
solution. Our idea is based on combining these two 
methods, and takes both the strengths of the both 
methods to make up the drawbacks they have. 
Therefore, we let the bacteria carry their own 
chromosomes, which mean that when the evolution 
goes on, both the bacteria’s positions and their genes 
on the chromosomes will change according to the 
courses of both BF and GA. The flowchart of 
Bacterial-GA Foraging is shown in Figure 1.
