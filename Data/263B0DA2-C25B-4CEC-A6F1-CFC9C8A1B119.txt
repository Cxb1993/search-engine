solution using a variety of membranes [2-4]. The membranes of PV with high flux and high 
selectivity are desired. Therefore, several methods of membrane preparation may be used to 
improve the separation performances such as: surface modification, blending, copolymerization, 
and grafting a selective species on to an inert film [5-9]. 
Asymmetric membranes which consist of a very thin and dense toplayer supported by a porous 
sublayer is the better choice for separation operation due to the combination of the high selectivity 
of a dense membrane with the high permeation rate of a very thin membrane. The phase inversion 
method has been used for the preparation of asymmetric membrane. In this process, nascent 
membrane containing polymer, solvent or additive is immersed in a coagulation bath containing a 
nonsolvent. Precipitation then occurred because of the exchange of solvent and nonsolvent [2]. 
Asymmetric hollow fiber membranes that were prepared by the immersion precipitation process 
have been wildly applied to separation process owing to possess many advantageous characteristics 
than the flat ones [10-16]. 
In the separation operation process, membrane morphology is one of the effective factors to 
affect the separation performance. The membrane morphology can be affected by changing casting 
conditions, such as casting solution composition, casting temperature, coagulation bath composition 
(included bore liquid and external coagulant composition in hollow fiber membrane preparation) etc. 
The pore size of membrane can also be reduced by post-treatment [17-19]. PAN membranes were 
widely used as the substrate of ultrafitration (UF), nanofiltration (NF), reverse osmosis (RO) and 
pervaporation [2]. Many researchers have investigated the effect of the modification of PAN 
membrane on the separation performances[19-23]. 
PAN fibers have been recognized as the most important and promising precursor for producing 
high performance carbon fiber. It dominates nearly 90% of all worldwide sales of carbon fibers [24]. 
PAN fibers form a thermally stable, highly oriented molecular structure when subjected to a heat 
treatment. By using PAN fiber as the precursor, the fiber was heated to 200-300OC in air 
atmosphere, this process is recognized as the PAN stabilization process [25]. During the 
stabilization process, applying a force along the fiber axial will enhance the polymer chain 
orientation. Moreover, dehydrogenation and cyclization will occur during stabilization process. 
In this proposal, asymmetric PAN hollow fiber membranes were prepared by using wet 
spinning process and then post-treatment for PV separation of aqueous IPA solution. The 
relationship between the post-treatment conditions and hollow fiber membrane morphology are 
investigated. Moreover, the separation performances of heat-treated hollow fiber membranes were 
also studied. 
Experiment 
Materials  
PAN polymer was supplied by the Tong-Hua synthesis fiber Co. LTD (Taiwan). The solvent, 
N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) was used without further purification. Water was used as the 
external and bore liquid coagulant. 
Preparation of PAN hollow fiber 
PAN hollow fiber membranes were fabricated by a wet spinning process. The PAN polymer 
was dissolved in DMF to form a 22 wt.% dope solution. The dope solution was extruded through a 
spinneret with 0.83 and 0.53 mm of outer diameter (o.d.) and inner diameter (i.d.), respectively. 
Bore liquid was delivered using a syringe pump. The degassed homogenous PAN dope solution and 
bore liquid were extruded through the spinneret die to form a nascent hollow fiber membrane and 
then immersed into water bath immediately. The hollow fiber was washed thoroughly with water to 
remove the residual solvent for at least three days.  
poor PV performance. Thus, how to modify the PAN hollow fiber membrane structures to further 
improve the PV performance is an important target in this article.

Effect of post-treatment on the hollow fiber membrane morphology 
The PAN precursor hollow fiber membranes were heat-treated at different temperature in the 
range of 60~210 OC for 12 hours. The SEM pictures of outer surface and outer edge part of PAN 
hollow fiber membranes cross-section are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig.3, respectively. As can be seen 
from these figures, there exist porous structure in the cross-section of PAN precursor hollow fiber. 
The porous structures became denser after heat-treatment and were denser with increasing the 
heat-treatment temperature. Moreover, the SEM pictures also reveal that the dense skin layer 
formed when the heat-treatment temperature was higher than 120 OC.

To evaluate the post-treatment effect on the PAN hollow fiber membranes morphology, the 
results were further confirmed by AFM analysis. Fig. 4 and Table II show the outer surface image 
and roughness of PAN hollow fiber membranes before and after post-treatment, respectively. It can 
be seen from Fig. 4 and Table II that the membrane surface structure varies with the different 
post-treatment temperature. The roughness of the outer surface of hollow fiber membranes is 
proportional to permeation rate and inversely proportional to water content in permeate. The 
analysis of AFM images showed that the roughness of the hollow fiber membranes in terms of Root 
mean square (Rms) of z values and Mean roughness (Ra) are decreased with the post-treatment 
temperature increased in the range of 60-180 OC. However, the roughness of the outer surface of 
hollow fiber membrane increased with increasing the temperature in the case of high temperature 
heat-treated (210 OC). After heat-treated, the porous outer surface of PAN precursor hollow fiber 
became more dense and smooth that resulted in the decrement of surface roughness. The hollow 
fiber membrane roughness increases at higher heat-treatment condition (210 OC) may be due to the 
formation of hollow fiber membrane surface cracks. These cracks lead to the permeation rate 
increase. Nevertheless, these cracks still not enough to let the water content in permeate decreases 
sharply. Consequently, the water content kept above 99 wt.% when the heat-treatment temperature 
was higher than 120 OC. From the viewpoints of energy and separation performance, the 120 OC 
heat-treated processes displays a best heat-treatment condition in this study.

Effect of post-treatment time on the PV performances 
Post-treatment temperature can influence not only morphology but also PV separation 
performances as describing above, the treatment time should also affect the morphology and 
separation performance of PAN post-treated hollow fiber membranes. The PV performances of PAN 
treated hollow fiber membranes preparation with different treatment time at the temperature of 120 
OC are shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen from Fig. 6 that the permeation rate almost leveled off below 
12 hours treatment and slight increases above this treatment time. Moreover, the water content in 
permeate data in Fig. 6 also imply that there was a certain critical value of treatment time around 12 
hours, the water content in permeate slight increased with an increase in treatment time below 12 
hours and then decreases above this time. These phenomena can be due to the change of 
morphology. Fig. 7 shows the outer surface and outer edge morphologies of 120 OC treated PAN 
hollow fiber membranes in the time range of 0 to 24 hours. As can be seen in Fig. 7, the porous 
structure became slight denser with increasing the treatment time. Thus, the water content in 
permeate slight increases with increasing treatment time. While these slight change of morphology 
still can not affect the permeation rate. When the treatment time was prolonged to 24 hours, the 
post-treatment process was too exceeded, resulted in the formation of surface cracks. These cracks 
resulted in the increment of permeation rate and decrement of water content in permeates. Hence, 
the 12 h heat-treated process displays a best post-treatment condition as in the case of 120 OC 
treated.

Effect of feed composition on PV performance 
The effect of feed composition on the PV performance for the PAN hollow fiber membranes 
post-treated at 120 OC for 12 hours is shown in Fig. 8. It shows that an increase in the feed IPA 
concentration results in a decrease in the permeation rate and an increase in the separation factor.

Abstract 
In this study, polysulfone (PSf) hollow fiber membrane was fabricated via dry/wet spinning process. 20wt% PSf 
/N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) solution and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) were used as dope solution and additive, 
respectively to investigate the effect of vapor induced phase separation (VIPS) on the morphology of PSf hollow fiber 
membrane. Furthermore, Chitosan (CS)/γ-glycidoxypropyl trimethoxysilane (GPTMS) solution was also used as the 
dip-coated solution to prepare the CS-GPTMS/PSf composite hollow fiber membrane for pervaporation (PV) of 
aqueous isopropanol (IPA) solution. The results show that the macrovoids of the cross-section of PSf hollow fiber 
membrane was suppressed at first and then was reappeared as increasing the air gap during spinning. By adding PEG 
200 in the PSf dope, the pure water flux of the PSf hollow fiber membrane was increased. Moreover, the permeation 
rate of CS/PSf composite hollow fiber membranes decreased while the water concentration in permeate increased as 
increasing the CS concentration. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
For industrial use, high separation performances membranes are desired. Many polymer modification technologies 
have been applied to improving the separation performance of membranes [1-3]. Composite membranes, with a dense, 
thin selective skin layer and a microporous support layer were used to prove the separation performances recently [4-6]. 
The supporting layer of composite membranes should be provided with high flux to avoid the decrease permeation rate 
of composite membranes. In general, asymmetric porous flat membrane as well as hollow fiber membrane can be used 
as the substrate.  
It is well known that asymmetric hollow fiber membranes have been widely applied to separation process owing to
