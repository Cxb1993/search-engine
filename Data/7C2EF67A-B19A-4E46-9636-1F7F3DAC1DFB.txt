real commercial materials for teeth implantation. Applying multiple 
implantable antennas to form smart beamforming antennas as smart 
nodes can promote the microwave propagation performance and 
suppress the radical impacts inwards body at the same time. There 
are mainly two types, analog and digital beamformers. Using 
ESPAR to adaptively vary beam angles on implantable devices can 
significantly improve its safety and reliability, and these devices can 
be combined with the bio-sensors and RFIC to establish a 
heterogeneous integration (HI) platform for biological monitoring in 
order to record personal health information at any time in 
everywhere. Applying the digital beamforming techniques for 
external processing boxes to strengthen the wireless transmission of 
the measured biological signals and also enlarge the range to

Development of Wireless Interface on Low Invasive Biological 
Monitoring Systems for Remote Health Care 
 
Chin-Lung Yang and Sheng-Hao Chen 
 
 Abstract 
Wireless low-invasive platforms for 
measuring physiological signals can effectively 
monitor individual person’s health states for 
long-term. There is no need for high-risk surgical 
to implant, but the electronic monitoring device 
can be placed in the mouth by a general technical 
(or flexible dentures). Assisting users to monitor 
their several physiological signals can achieve 
remote home care and distribute medical resources 
effectively. So, early detection and early treatment 
may be possible and feasible. One of important 
research of the biomedical equipment is the 
development of the implantable devices for the 
long-term.  
The first challenge is the size of electronic 
devices including system-on-chip (SoC), sensing 
components, circuits, and antennas. Also 
integrating sensors and tiny radio frequency chip 
establish a heterogeneous integration system 
platform to monitor biomedical signs. Moreover, 
the practical package technologies and fabrication 
process for tiny chips and devices are required to 
further challenges for the applications of 
commercial products.  
The initial physiological parameters target the 
temperature measurement for the precursor and 
warning of the general diseases. This project 
proposed the design of high sensitivity of up to 
0.1 ℃, so the implanted device can effectively 
and accurately obtain physiological information. 
This combination of electronic devices provides 
monitoring of physiological health functions upon 
the general oral and dentals. So personal 
information can be recorded at anytime and 
anywhere and further be connected with wireless 
local area networks (WLAN) or Internet to deliver 
physiological parameters to achieve a 
long-distance health care medical center. A whole 
mobile health care network can be established to 
promote to enhance the quality and efficiency of 
medical services for Taiwanese. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
  
Long-term physiological signal monitoring 
can facilitate early disease detection, prevention, 
and treatment, and can utilize limited clinical 
resources effectively. Furthermore, diseases across 
numerous civilizations are occurring in younger 
victims. Not only the elderly require long-term 
physiological signal monitoring home care, but the 
need for such care is gradually increasing among 
the middle-aged and young people. 
Recently, numerous mobile and implantable 
physiological signal monitoring devices have been 
proposed [1]. With the need to measure different 
physiological signals, electronic measurement 
devices need to be implanted in the corresponding 
organ tissues. As has been shown [2], long-term 
observation of the intraocular pressure 
measurement can prevent glaucoma and eye 
lesions. Long-term observation of blood sugar is 
clearly helpful to diabetics in controlling their 
blood sugar levels. Traditional observation 
requires blood extraction to measure blood sugar. 
The blood sugar measurement system proposed in 
[3] combines non-intrusive sensors to assist 
patients that require long-term blood sugar control. 
In summary, physiological signal 
measurement systems can be categorized as 
invasive, non-invasive, and low-invasive. These 
three systems are compared in Table I. While 
invasive systems produce the clearest 
physiological signals, implant system designs are 
strictly limited in terms of power supply and size, 
and require users to assume the risk of 
implantation surgery. Non-invasive system design 
conditions are more flexible, but signal 
measurement is often extremely weak and difficult 
to detect; and the system framework generally 
requires users to wear an electronic device, or can 
only be measured wirelessly in a restricted space. 
Low-invasive systems, however, measure a clearer 
signal than non-invasive systems while 
maintaining relatively simple design conditions: 
battery replacement, circuit updates, and upgrades 
are all easily executed in this structure. Though the 
size of the low-invasive system suffers the same 
limitations as the invasive system does, it can 
measure physiological signals without the risk of 
electronic device implantation surgery. 
Low-invasive devices combine measurement 
systems with low-invasive products like artificial 
teeth or contact lenses, allowing samples easily 
obtained by the system to measure physiological 
signals. Coupled with telecommunications, these 
systems grant users the freedom of mobility, as 
physiological signal monitoring no longer requires 
staying in a specific location, or remaining within 
system [4]. The block diagram for this system is 
illustrated in Fig. 1. The sensing element selected 
for this system to demonstrate is the temperature 
measurement and resolve BBT resolution 
requirement through a highly sensitive sampling 
amplifier. The system is then connected to VCO 
(IC Max2608) and an antenna (dental antenna) to 
complete a wireless frequency modulation (FM) 
low-invasive physiological signal monitoring 
system transmitter module. 
 
Figure 1. System block diagram 
  
This study placed a miniaturized artificial 
tooth BBT monitoring system in the oral cavity to 
verify functionality of this system though the 
wireless channel of the complex human oral cavity, 
and used the results to confirm the system 
implementation for the required specifications for 
BBT monitoring. 
 
II. Transmitter System 
The communication modulation technology 
used in the system was frequency modulation. Due 
to that data modulated to frequency in the 
implanted communication channel has a lower bit 
error rate (BER) compared to the OOK code that 
is often applied to implantable systems [5]. The 
principle of the transmitter system is to use the 
change in the thermistor impedance value to 
measure temperature, and transform the change in 
impedance value into change in voltage through a 
sampling circuit. This voltage change is then input 
into the VCO, where it is FSK modulated before 
the data is directly transmitted from the antenna to 
the external receiver module. Therefore, the TX 
system is composed of 4 blocks: a thermal sensor 
(thermistor), a sampling and amplifying circuit 
(NIC amplifier), a transmitter (Max2608 VCO), 
and an antenna as shown in Fig. 2. Moreover, this 
structure can be very simple to carry out the 
architecture for ultra-low power consumption 
transmitter. 
 
Figure 2. Architecture of the transmitter for basal body 
temperature (BBT) monitoring systems 
  
To realize a wireless low-invasive implantable 
physiological signal monitoring system, the entire 
system must be designed with a total size smaller 
than that of a molar; the greatest challenge to 
which is designing a micro MedRadio Band 
antenna within these space limitations. Through a 
multi-modal design, the original 5 MHz frequency 
antenna [4] was increased by 276 % to a frequency 
of 13.8 MHz, to resolve issues created by 
implementation and environmental variations.  
This study designed the antenna using the 
Ansoft High Frequency Structure Simulator 
(HFSS) antenna simulation software, and included 
the oral cavity’s environmental effect on the 
antenna in the design. The customized antenna can 
be embedded in the tooth mold, thereby limiting 
the effect of variations of the mold on operational 
bandwidth due to differences among people as 
shown in Fig. 3. While the embedded antenna 
design increases tolerance, it is unsuitable for a 
multi-layered stack design, because its hardness 
would be susceptible to damage. Therefore, a 
single layer cover stack design was applied.

Antenna Design 
Figure 3. Tooth mold antenna design  
Using the embedded antenna design increased 
tooth mold and environment variation tolerance by 
10%, as compared to the exposed antenna design, 
as shown in Table II.

  In this system, the monitored basal body 
temperature must reach 0.1 to 0.3 ºC resolution at 
a body temperature of 36 to 37.5 ºC. The focus of 
this design differs from prior research on 
temperature-to-frequency converters. Rather than 
examining a wide range of linearity [6-7], this 
system needed to achieve extremely high 
sensitivity within a small range of temperatures.  
Considering the size issue in this implantable 
system, the entire TX system architecture needed 
to be simplified to reduce the necessary size and 
power consumption. Therefore, the simplest 
impedance voltage divider sampling concept was 
value to achieve the sensitivity required by the 
system. 
This study designed a negative impedance 
sampling amplified circuit, conserving space by 
using only one amplifier to produce a highly 
sensitive sampling circuit. The study also derived 
a reverse input terminal through circuit analysis 
that included an electrical source and a mechanism 
for adjusting the working input range. A negative 
impedance sampling circuit can definitely produce 
sensitivity great enough to satisfy the system’s 
requirements; thereby breaking through the 
sensitivity limitations of traditional impedance 
serially-connected voltage divider sampling 
circuits, and completing the conversion required to 
connect the thermistor with the VCO. 
 
IV. Antenna Design 
Numerous design considerations were 
required for a MedRadio Band antenna in an 
implantable device; one of the most challenging 
was the antenna miniature design. However, in 
addition to miniaturization, numerous other 
challenges were presented in its design; including 
the integration of the antenna and the implantation 
device [8], implantation environment 
considerations, the direction of the antenna, the 
enlarged bandwidth design, the biological 
compatibility, and the antenna gain. 
Creating a miniaturized antenna necessitates 
obtaining the antenna’s longest effective current 
path within a given area. Therefore, the Hilbert 
fractal antenna design was adopted in the initial 
stages of design [9]. The Hilbert curve has a 
highly efficient use of space, being able to draw a 
longer curved path over the same area, avoiding 
self-cross, and is suitable for use in rectangles. 
 
Figure 6. evolution of the Hilbert curves  
  
The Hilbert curve evolves in a rectangular 
surface area to reach an extremely high spatial 
usage ratio. The Hilbert curve evolution is shown 
in Fig. 6, where the Hilbert length is defined as L, 
each smallest line segment is defined as d, the 
evolutionary order is defined as n, and the total 
line segment length is defined as S. Because the 
Hilbert curve can evolve in a given area, each 
smallest line segment can be defined as (5)[10]: 
  (5) 
The Hilbert curve evolution grows S to a 
length of 2
n
; however, in actual applications, 
because the antenna current paths will counteract 
each other, and because the gap between segments 
will decrease as the Hilbert evolution progresses, 
the length of the antenna’s effective current path is 
less than the ideal S value designed. Hilbert 
evolutionary order is related to the resonant 
frequency. As shown in Fig. 7, resonant frequency 
decreases as the orders increase, and the S/λ0 ratio 
increases with the evolutionary orders [11]. 
Therefore, by applying the Hilbert curve fractal 
antenna design, the resonant frequency can lower 
to one-fifth original operation frequency under the 
same space limitation. However, an increase in 
order creates a diminishing marginal effect on the 
decrease in resonant frequency. Besides, as the 
order n increases, the fabrication becomes 
infeasible due to the extreme small gaps and line 
widths.  
 
Figure 7. Marginal effect of evolutionary orders 
  
Selected in the initial stages of design, the 
greatest surface area for the tooth mold was 8 x 
11.5 x 8 mm
3
, the average size for an Asian molar 
[4]. With a high dielectric coefficient (εr = 21) [12] 
and a high biological compatibility [13], ZrO2 was 
selected as the material for the tooth mold, 
according to the ¼  wavelength antenna design 
equation (6)[14]: 
       (6) 
      In this equation, f is the designed antenna 
frequency, C is the speed of light, LT is the total 
length of the antenna, and εr is the dielectric 
coefficient for the antenna base. If a low frequency 
antenna is desired, selecting a substrate with a 
high dielectric coefficient could help antenna 
miniaturization. Applying the embedded antenna 
design in Fig. 3 could also increase the εr, 
facilitating the miniature design of the antenna. 
Furthermore, wrapping the antenna with high 
dielectric material can decrease the changes in 
frequency caused by environmental variations.  
 
substrate with a high dielectric coefficient, a 
three-dimensional antenna design, and a fractal 
design to achieve antenna miniaturization, by 
combing a multi-current path design with Hilbert 
and Spirals to increase the antenna bandwidth and 
gain, the gain from this antenna was 20 to 30 dB 
greater than the implantable miniature antennas in 
all prior studies. By improving the passive 
components, this study decreased overall power 
consumption and simplified the system.  
V. Measurement Setup 
Figure 12 shows the setup for the 
measurement of the BBT including precise digital 
multi-meter (DMM), spectrum analyzer, power 
supply, a heating plate, and a uniform heating 
container.  
 
 
Fig. 12. Wireless experiment setup 
To facilitate the observation changes in the 
impedance value, a thermistor is heated uniformly 
in water. The thermistor is fabricated 
independently in another circuit board layout, and 
two single probes are wired out to integrate with 
our sampling circuit and to compare with precise 
meters. To measure the temperature and resistance 
simultaneously, the thermistor is first covered with 
waterproof plastic wrap, and then the thermistor 
and the temperature probe of the precise DMM are 
placed together in the water. The temperature is 
controlled by a heating plate. A Picotest M3500A 
DMM and Agilent U3606A DMM are used for 
resistance and voltage measurements, respectively. 
In the transmitter part, VTune of the VCO is 
monitored by Agilent U3606A DMM under the 
controlled temperature range of BBT while the 
Picotest M3500A DMM is used to monitor the 
actual temperatures. The output frequency of the 
transmitter can be verified to cover the MedRadio 
band. Meanwhile, wireless (over 60 cm) and wired 
(through cable) measurements are performed to 
estimate the frequency deviations. In the receiver 
part, a patch antenna is attached on Agilent 9010A 
spectrum analyzer. The measured temperature is 
converted from the measured peak frequency and 
compared actual temperatures to estimate the 
errors. 
VI. Results and Discussion 
The sampling circuit converted the change in 
impedance created by BBT into voltage. A 
temperature change between 36 ºC and 37.5 ºC 
was converted through thermistor  impedance 
and the sampling circuit to a corresponding 
voltage output of 1.089 V to 1.294 V, a voltage 
difference of 0.205 V. Sensitivity was 0.0765 
(∆𝑉𝑚/∆𝑅𝑇𝑒𝑚𝑝), or 0.0243 greater than the 0.0522 
anticipated sensitivity, for an error of 
approximately 47 %. Additionally, the output level 
increased by approximately 0.2 V from the 
originally designed (1.07 V to 1.21 V). These 
errors occurred primarily because the single cable 
impedance was not considered. Due to the high 
sensitivity of the negative impedance sampling 
amplifier circuit, the single cable impedance 
slightly offset between implementation and 
simulation.

Figure 13. Cable, wireless, and simulation temperature- 
frequency conversion curves 
  
The measurement and simulation results for 
the entire system are shown in Fig. 13. This graph 
demonstrates the output frequencies corresponding 
to different temperatures for cable and wireless 
measurements. The relative results for cable and 
wireless within the BBT range were remarkably 
similar. The temperature within the MedRadio 
Band ranged from 35.5 ºC to 37 ºC. The measured 
wireless results and the simulated system results 
could be considered identical, as the only 
difference possibly stemmed from the thermistor 
itself. Within the BBT range, the greatest range of 
error between the simulated frequency and 
measured wireless frequency was only ±0.08 % 
(36.4 ºC). 
By establishing a theoretical temperature- 
frequency conversion curve, the measured 
frequency could be demodulated by the theoretical 
curve to produce the corresponding temperature. 
In the entire system, the greatest error between the 
demodulated temperature and the theoretical curve 
was only 0.13 ºC (at 36.4 ºC).  
The offset errors from repeated experiments 
verifying the temperature system are shown in Fig. 
14. Centered at 0, the results are segmented into 
intervals of 0.05 ºC and boundaries were 
determined by size equivalent or above. The 
conversion curve was demodulated by Matlab 
software according to the frequency-temperature

High Efficiency Midrange Wireless 
Power Transfer System
• The driving amplifier of  class D, E, full bridge D are analyzed.
– the highest power tests were performed using a full bridge class D 
amplifier as it has the lowest device rating requirements of the amplifier 
types investigating, and would be well suited for a system transmitting 
100W-1kW of power.
• A demonstration system is built and characterized. 
– Laptop is wirelessly charged and operated.
• Increasing coupling and reducing parasitic resistance are two methods 
to increase efficiency. 
– Coupling is roughly related to the size of the coils, so for a fixed coil size 
the losses to resistive parasitics could be reduced by utilizing a less lossy
conductor for the coil windings or, potentially, increasing the frequency of 
operation so that the mutual impedance (jωM) increases.
• The system achieves 76% efficiency (end-to-end) for a distance of 
1 meter for 40W transferred power. 
• The effects of changes to the geometry of the system (pitch angle of 
coils, separation distance) are also examined.

技術說明
(中文) 無線侵入式/低侵入式植入生理信號量測系統的發射端，使用本專利所提出之
MedRadio Band (401-406 MHz)微型化牙天線，其縮小天線尺寸設計嵌入在齒模
當中，將生理信號傳送給外部的接收端進行長期監測與追蹤以實現居家照護之功
能。本計畫之核心技術為操作於MedRadio Band的假牙天線，在縮小天線的技術
上利用高介電系數的牙材ZrO2 (εr~ 9-21)與分形(Fractal)天線的技術來實現
天線的微型化；本文挑選適合於矩形空間演化的Hilbert曲線的分形天線，以達
相同面積下之最大空間使用率，藉由公式計算出所需的階數與曲線長度，再依據
本專利提出的優化天線技巧調整圖形之間X軸與Y軸的距離達到MedRadio Band的
共振頻率；為了增加天線克服環境變異的能力，將Hilbert天線與螺旋天線
(Spiral Antenna)中的阿基米德螺線(Archimedean Spirals)結合，形成多電流
路徑寬頻化的天線設計，其中的Path1採1/4λ設計讓天線產生1較高頻的模態，
Path2採1/4λ設計並且達成Path3路徑的天線耦合饋入使Path3達到1/2λ的較低
頻模態設計，將兩個模態靠近後形成較寬的頻寬，設計模擬天線頻寬為14MHz。
這樣天線這設計可以達到更有效的輻射使得微型天線增益可以高達-3.8dBi。
