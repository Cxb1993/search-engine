I. INTRODUCTION 
Wireless power transfer is a promising technique for the long-term power supply of wireless applications [1]. 
Normally, the rectenna is one of the most important components for microwave power transmission; it consists of 
a microwave antenna, a lowpass filter, a diode, an LPF for dc path, and a resistive load. For antenna, circularly 
polarized(CP) antenna have been received much attention for the applications of the wireless communication 
systems such as WLAN, ISM, RFID and Bluetooth, because they are not only able to reduce the multipath effects 
but also allow more flexible orientation of the transmitter and receiver antennas. Several antennas have been used 
in rectenna such as microstrip patch antenna [2-4], dielectric resonator antenna [5-7], large antenna arrays [8], and 
slot antenna[9-12]. Before, most structure of the circularly polarized antenna with using microstrip patch antenna 
of designs, because characteristic of the microstrip patch antenna with narrow bandwidth, so not consider using 
designs of the microstrip patch antenna. In the research, slot antennas have become the subject of great interest to 
the engineering designer due to their miniaturization potential and relatively wide bandwidth, and provide the 
favorable features such as thin, flat profile, low weight, easy to fabricate, and low production cost. In general, the 
radiation patterns of the slot antenna are linearly polarized (LP); they are difficult to radiate circularly polarized 
wave which was generated by two near-degenerated orthogonal resonant modes of equal amplitude and 90o 
phase difference. Therefore, the circularly polarized antennas are often utilized in radar, satellite, radio frequency 
identification (RFID), navigation, and sensor systems. In addition to receive more microwave power, a single 
rectenna is usually replaced with a rectenna array. Array rectenna can handle higher incident power density and 
radiation gain. This could lead to higher overall output power and conversion efficiency. 
In the paper, an novel slot array antenna with circular polarization are proposed in the Figure 1. The proposed 
array antenna composed of a slot with an open stub. The result of the antenna gain is about 6~7.2 dBi. With the 
present design, a maximum voltage of 6.5 V and a conversion efficiency of 70 % could be attainable. The 
proposed antenna can be applied to multiband multipolarized systems to mitigate interference effects. 
II. ARRAY RECTENNA DESIGN 
A. Array Antenna Design 
The geometry of the proposed single slot antenna and slot array antenna are shown in Figure 1.They were 
etched on 0.8 mm thick FR4 substrate with relative permittivity r = 4.4 and loss tangent tan  = 0.0245. The 
overall dimensions of the antenna are about 103103 mm2. The group of the proposed antenna parameters 
obtained in simulation are L = 41.5 mm, W = 41.5 mm, L1 = 26 mm, L2 = 23 mm, R = 16 mm, W1 = 1.5 mm, W2 = 
1 mm, H = 0.8 mm, respectively. The lower resonant frequency is determined by the microstrip line with a size of 
length L1. It can excite a RHCP wave at the lower frequency band. The high resonant frequency is determined by 
the open stub with a size of length L2. It can excite a RHCP wave at the higher frequency band. Both the antenna 
feed and rectifier input port have characteristic impedance of 50Ωfor good impedance matching to reduce signal 
reflection between these components. 
 
B. Filter and Matching Circuit 
Besides, for the rectenna integrated with nonlinear circuits, such as diodes or FETs, it is well known that 
Figure 8 shows the proposed CP array rectenna. The measured output DC voltage and RF-to-DC conversion 
efficiency of the proposed CP array rectenna at 2.4 GHz versus received power with the various load resistances 
are shown in Fig.9 and Fig.10, respectively. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
A novel slot array rectenna with circular polarization (CP) are presented. The proposed array antenna 
composed of a slot with an open stub. The measured results show the (10 dB return loss) input impedance 
bandwidth for the RHCP is about 573 MHz from 2043~2616 MHz, representing 24.59% with respect to 2.45 
GHz. The measured 3 dB axial ration bandwidth for the RHCP is 280 MHz, from 2280 to 2650 MHz, 
corresponding to about 11.57% with respect to 2.45 GHz. The measured radiation gain of proposed array antenna, 
the antenna gain is in range of about 6~7.2 dBi. With the present design, the measured maximum voltage of 6.5 V 
and a conversion efficiency of 70 % could be attainable. The proposed antenna can be applied to multiband 
multipolarized systems to mitigate interference effects.
