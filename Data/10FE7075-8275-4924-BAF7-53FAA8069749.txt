1. 前言 (Introduction)  
It is envisioned that the basic design of the next-generation wireless networks would support 
seamless extensive radio systems, including diverse access networks that range from high-capacity 
picocell networks to micro and macro networks. On one hand, microcell networks, which are 
adopted in most congested areas (hot-spot areas), and provide a higher capacity than macrocell 
networks per unit area, are attractive and are now typical of next-generation mobile radio systems. 
On the other hand, an integrated system architecture consisting of two tiers of microcells and 
macrocells serves the objective of ensuring both low and high mobility in personal communications 
with lower blocking probability and lower dropping probability. Therefore, an overlapping coverage 
that is composed of both macrocell and microcell in a multi-tier underlying structure is a highly 
promising.  
2. 研究目的 (Objective)  
Our studies refer to a two-tier coverage WiMAX network consisting of overlapping Pico and 
Macro cells in a realistic urban context to serve both conventional mobile subscribers and 
quasi-stationary subscribers. The purpose of this study is to enable adaptive network selection and 
efficient resource management, the mobile WiMAX must consider the multi-rate transmission 
property (which affects system resource utility, transmission data rate, delay, etc) to reduce call 
blocking probability (CBP) and call dropping probability (CDP). 
3. 文獻探討(Related work)  
Various systems and techniques have been proposed to meet the growing demands of cellular 
and personal communications. Among them, the underlying proposed integrated multi-tier 
architectures can be classified into two categories: homogeneous [1] and heterogeneous [2].The 
increasing demands for heterogeneous services necessitate a high quality of service (QoS) that 
allows the radio networks to provide mobile users with roaming capability across different systems. 
From the literature [3-4], it can be observed that the major challenges of multi-tier system-design 
activity are radio resource management (RRM) or common radio resource management (CRRM) 
RRM can be grouped by various schemes. One of the schemes is the call connection control scheme 
which encompasses call admission control (CAC), base station assignment, and handoff algorithms 
[5]. Several CAC schemes have been proposed to guarantee QoS for multimedia applications in 
wireless networks. Most CAC schemes estimate the resource of the cell and determine whether it 
satisfies the connection, i.e. the connection is accepted if it is satisfied; otherwise, the strategy 
adjusts the QoS level of a low priority connection to serve a higher priority connection [6-7]. The 
definition of an OFDMA slot of WiMAX depends mainly on the mode of permutation of 
subcarriers in an OFDMA subchannel. Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) is one of 
permutations modes of WiMAX which can offer an alternative link adaptation method that 
 3
network is large than 0, called candidate network, then the next procedure is initiated. Otherwise, 
the call will be blocked for UGS/BE case or initial AQLS for RT-VR/ NRT-VR case. After the QoS 
level of this call has been adjusted, the HNSS is executed again. If both adaptive costs are still 
smaller than 0, this call will be blocked. The third procedure is to select the candidate network with 
maximum Cn_i as the target serving network, and the PRBS is then initiated. 
Assuming the series set A comprises three series AU={TU_m_s, BU_v}, AM={TM_m_s, BM_v} and 
AP={TP_m_s, BP_v}. AU is an ideal series, where the TU_m_s is the value of criterion T for service type s 
using modulation method m for the MN, and the BU_v is the value of criterion Bv for the MN to meet 
the required QoS, respectively. For AM, where the TM_m_s is the value of criterion T for service type s 
using modulation method m and the BM_v is the value of criterion Bv provided by Macro WiMAX 
network, respectively. For AP, where the TP_m_s is the value of criterion T for service type s using 
modulation method m and the BP_v is the value of criterion Bv provided by Pico WiMAX network, 
respectively.  
The GRA normalizes the AU, AM and AP by equation (1), where xij denotes the jth criterion of 
the ith series, and the m and n denote the number of series and criterion, respectively.

dropping probabilities. The procedure of AQLS for the different traffic types are described as 
follows:  
z AQLS for RT-VR 
The scheme executes the adaptive procedure for RT-VR type services based on different 
modulation methods. In the first case, when the 64-QAM method is used, the highest level of 
EL will be abandoned to decrease the required transmission rate. In the second case, when the 
16-QAM method is used, the highest and second levels of EL will be abandoned to decrease 
the required transmission rate. In the last case, when the QPSK method is used, it only BL is 
transmitted.  
z AQLS for NRT-VR  
NRT-VR obtains the minimum requirement after executing AQLS.  
4.4 Prediction Reservation Bandwidth Scheme (PRBS) 
 After the system selects the target network, the candidate networks with cost value larger than 
0 execute the PRBS for UGS and RT-VR services. The candidate networks reserve different 
bandwidths according to various service types.  PRBS uses the Grey prediction, based on the 
GM(1,1) model, to predict the call dropping probability (CDP) of UGS and RT-VR to adjust 
reservation bandwidth adaptively.  
 Firstly, the low boundary and high boundary thresholds of CDP are defined as Th1s_CDP and 
Th2s_CDP, respectively, where s denotes UGS or RT-VR. Secondly, series Ps(0) is the CDP in 
candidate network for UGS or RT-VR as equation (10).

where n denotes the number of element in Ps(0). Then, the PRBS uses series Ps(0) to obtain the

respectively. Due to the use of PRBS, the CBP is increased for every traffic type, while the 
improvements are decreased approximately 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.1% and 0.2~1% respectively. The 
improvement for BE is minimal to the reason is that it has the lowest priority. Due to application of 
the adaptive resource reservation approach, the increased CBP for adopting PRBS is also marginal.   
For Case_2, comparing Figure 4(b) with only HNSS, the improvements of CBP for UGS, 
RT-VR NRT-VR and BE are approximately 0.3~0.9%, 1.4~2.7%, 0.5~0.8%, and 1.5~2.4% 
respectively. Both cases that use AQLS+PRBS show that the improvements of CBP are less that 
those using AQLS only, and that Case_2 has worse performance than Case_1 (0.2~0.5% less than 
Case_1 due to increasing RT-VT traffic, inducing more reserved bandwidth).  
Figure 5(a) and Figure 5(b) show the CDP as HNSS+AQLS+PRBS of Case_1 and Case_2 
respectively. Comparing Figure 5(a) (resp. Figure 5(b)) with only HNSS, the improvements of CDP 
for UGS, RT-VR, NRT-VR and BE are approximately 0.4~1.1%, 0.6~1%, -0.9~-4%, and -1~-3% 
(resp. 0.3~0.9%, 0.6~1.6%, -0.9~-3.8%, and -1.7~-4.6%), respectively, when AQLS+PRBS is 
adopted. With PRBS, the CDPs for real-time traffic are decreased, and the CDPs for non-real-time 
traffic are increased greatly, especially for Case_2. In Case_2, the CDP of RT-VR is less than UGS 
as the adaptive resource reservation approach is adopted to obtain more resource when the RT-VR is 
varied.  
Figure 6(a) and Figure 6(b) show the CRP as HNSS+AQLS for Case_1 and Case_2 
respectively. According to Figure 6(a), the improvements of CRP for UGS and RT-VR are 
approximately 0.9~1.6% and 1.1~2.1% respectively. However, for NRT-VR and BE, the CRPs are 
increased approximately 0.2% and 0.7~3.2% respectively. For Case_2, the improvements of CRP 
for UGS, RT-VR NRT-VR and BE are approximately 0.6~2%, 2~4.3%, -0.2~-3.2% and -1.2~-4.6% 
respectively and this is higher than that of Case_1. We note that a resource reservation approach can 
improve real-time performances by decreasing non-real-time ones. In our work, this impact is 
marginal due to the adaptive design of our scheme.  
Finally, the delay times for Case_1 and Case_2 are illustrated in Figure 7(a) and Figure 7(b), 
respectively. AQLS increases the success probability for new calls, while PRBS increases the 
reserved resource for UGS and RT-VR that induces the delay time of each traffic type. When the 
arrival rate is equal to 6 calls/s, the delay times of BE, NRT-VR, RT-VR, UGS are lower than 
150ms. This is due to the higher arrival rate of BE, which causes its delay time to be higher than 
NRT-VR.  
6. 結論 (Conclusion)  
In this report, a novel hierarchical network selection strategy was proposed by using the SVC 
property and modulation method of WiMAX to select the better BS, adjust QoS level and reserve 
resource adaptively. The system performance in homogeneous two-tier WiMAX networks has been 
estimated for the proposed approach. Our simulation results show that the performance is improved 
with the use of AQLS. We note that when PRBS is adopted, the amount of increased CBP is

This project propose a strategy to  adaptive network selection and
efficient resource management in the multi-layer mobile WiMAX network
considering the multi-rate transmission property  to reduce call
blocking probability (CBP) and call dropping probability (CDP). In
this report, we propose a hierarchical network selection strategy
(HNSS) that is based on the Grey relational analysis (GRA) to enhance
the functionality of the mobile node, allowing it to select the
appropriate base station. If there is insufficient bandwidth, the
adaptive QoS level scheme (AQLS) is initiated, adjusting the QoS
level in order to reduce CDP or CBP. The candidate base station (BS)
can also dynamically perform prediction of reservation bandwidth
scheme (PRBS) to reduce the CDP.
