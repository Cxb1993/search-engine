1.中文摘要 
為尋求下一代低介電材料（κ < 2.5）之研
發，其關鍵是將孔洞加入矽基的介電質中。大
多數含孔洞的氧化矽膜是藉由界面活性劑模
板產生，而在移除界面活性劑後即可形成孔
洞。但迄今在多孔性介電質的整合上已發現幾
個大問題，如多孔性低介電材料在面臨蝕刻步
驟時無法保持邊璧的平整，進而使得擴散阻障
層無法形成連續的薄膜，金屬層擴散入曝露出
來的介電層中造成元件可靠度的問題。為了避
免上述問題，我們需要在多孔性介電材料上有
新的設計及整合。Shipley 公司因此提出了
Solid-First 新概念：在兩相式低介電薄膜中，
將起孔洞劑（porogen）延後至金屬層完成後
才燒除。延續第一年的結果，本研究仍是利用
Solid-First 製程，討論 poly (styerene-block-4 
vinyl pyridine) （PS-b-P4VP）高溫起孔洞劑對
甲基矽氧烷（methylsilsesquioxane, MSQ）低
介電基材的影響，並將其與多孔性和緻密
MSQ 之介電性質、機械強度與水氣吸脫附、
擴散行為作一有系統的比較。 
在第二年的研究中，吾人利用奈米壓痕機
和傅立葉紅外線光譜儀（FT-IR）探討上述材
料系統之機械性質。實驗發現當起孔洞劑含量
低於臨界值時（對 PS-b-P4VP 而言約為 50 wt 
%），兩相式（MSQ/PS-b-P4VP）低介電薄膜
之機械強度比多孔性，甚至是緻密的 MSQ 薄
膜都來得高。這是因為高溫起孔劑對 MSQ 基
材交聯的程度會產生影響，意即此類新式兩相
低介電材料將有足夠的機械強度承受 CMP 所
施加的應力且不破壞。除此之外，吾人亦利用
自行組裝的石英晶體微天平（QCM）探討上
述材料之水氣吸脫附及擴散行為。實驗發現兩
相式材料之飽和水氣吸附量較多孔性或是緻
密之MSQ來得高上許多，此乃因為PS-b-P4VP
本身為吸水性高之起孔洞劑（約 6.7 wt %），
另一可能之原因為低溫固化（250 °C）之兩相
式薄膜內尚存未完全交聯的 Si-OH 官能基。另
外 ， 低 介 電 薄 膜 經 hexamethlydisilazane
（HMDS）表面處理前後的水氣吸脫附情形亦
將於內文中詳述。 
至於水氣於低介電薄膜中的擴散行為，除
了起孔洞劑含量太高，孔洞形貌發生改變外，
水氣於低起孔洞劑含量之兩相式薄膜中的擴
散情形幾乎都符合 Fickian 擴散行為。在低於
20 wt %起孔洞劑含量時，其水氣擴散係數為
一定值。這是由於薄膜在固化期間生成了一層
很薄的緻密層，而這層緻密層恰好成為阻礙水
氣擴散的阻障層，可以防止溶液前驅物等滲入
多孔性或兩相式的低介電層中，有利於增進
Solid-First 製程的可行性。 
在本研究的最後一部分中，吾人嘗試以奈
米高分子 - 聚苯乙烯（polystyrene，PS）作為
高溫（Td = 355 °C）起孔洞劑。並首度結合奈

表面電位之改質，期望能獲得擁有較佳的孔洞
分散性與孔洞形貌的奈米高溫起孔洞劑。目前
已有初步的結果，尤其是在 PS 表面電位對高
溫起孔洞劑於低介電 MSQ 基材中之分散性與
孔洞尺寸之影響有所發現，於稍後之內文中對
此亦將有所敘述。 
本研究於下一年度（2007-2008）將利用

特性作一有系統的研究與討論。 
low-k materials with κ < 2.5 are being fervently 
developed in order to reduce the increasing RC 
delay in the backend interconnects. So far, it is 
well recognized that incorporation of porosity is 
critical to the search of viable low-k materials 
with κ < 2.5 for 45 nm technology node and 
beyond. The conventional porous low-k 
dielectric is generally formed after deposition of 
matrix with porogens, then burning out the 
porogen at high temperature. Several 
showstopper issues, However, related to 
as-deposited porous dielectrics (κ < 2.5) have 
been identified from their process integration; 
namely: (1) delamination and cracks during 
CMP and other process due to low mechanical 
strength, (2) bias-temperature stressing (BTS) 
failure due to non-continuous side-wall coverage 
of barrier deposited by atomic layer deposition, 
chemical vapor deposition or physical vapor 
deposition process. [2]. To circumvent these 
roadblocks, a novel Solid-First approach in 
materials design using high temperature porogen 
and integration has been proposed by Shipley 
Company to defer the formation of lower κ, 
porous dielectric after completing a metal layer, 
and then thermally remove the sacrificial 
porogen in the two-phase dielectric film [3]. But, 
there is little understanding of its materials 
properties either as-deposited or after the 
removal of porogen. 
For porous dielectrics, there are additional 
concerns related to moisture and solvent uptake 
induced by processing steps such as CMP, 
post-etch cleaning, post-CMP cleaning or resist 
removal. The dielectric properties of porous 
low-k materials will be significantly degraded if 
residual H2O (κwater ~ 78) adsorbed in the matrix 
and porogen. In addition, the moisture 
outgassing may destroy diffusion barrier or 
etch-stop layer during thermal process [4] 
resulting in delamination or catastrophic fracture 
the die. However, there is still little 
understanding of the adsorption behavior, 
moisture uptake, and outgassing behavior of 
low-k dielectric materials, especially porous 
dielectrics including the matrix/porogen hybrid 
in Solid-First scheme. 
According to the 1st year results, a commercial, 
spin-on organosilicate such as MSQ was used as 
the matrix and high-temperature porogens were 
employed as the sacrificial component. The 
amphiphilic block copolymers (ABCs), such as 
PS-b-P4VP, could be used as ideal porogen since 
they offer the advantages of microphase 
morphologies for controlling the pore shape and 
size. It is postulated that intermolecular 
hydrogen bonding [5-7] significantly improved 
the miscibility of the MSQ/ABCs hybrid and 
thus aggregation would not occur during curing. 
The amphiphilic characteristic of the MSQ is 
changed to hydrophobic because of the 
condensation of the Si–OH groups to the 
Si–O–Si linkages during the thermal curing. 
Hence, microphase separation is expected 
through the hydrophobic amphiphilic interaction 
between MSQ and ABCs [8]. Besides, several 
basic materials properties, such as the 
compatibility of porogen/matrix/solvents and the 
effect of high temperature porogen on the 
formation of low-k materials, thermal stability, 
structure transformation, internal porosity, pore 
morphology, and optical properties, have been 
reported in the August last year. 
In this year research, we intended to compare 
the materials mechanical properties and its 
moisture uptake among the following three types 
of materials (a) “solid-only” low-k materials 
from matrix only, without porosity as control, (b) 
hybrid low-k materials (matrix + porogen) which 
interact with all backend processing steps, and (c)  
porous low-k materials after the removal of 
porogen phase in order to elucidate the impact of 
such porogens and Solid-First scheme shown in 
Figure 1.  
In this report, the mechanical properties of 
three types of low-k materials films cured at 300 
°C and 400 °C were compared and assessed for 
their integration feasibility. In addition, these 
low-k films cured at 250 °C and 400 °C were 
employed to investigate the impact of porogen 
and porosity on the moisture uptake and 
diffusion behavior. The implication of moisture 
uptake and diffusion with ILD processing will be 
also discussed.

°C for 30 min. 
 
2. Thin film characterization 
The study of mechanical strength of prepared 
low-k films were carried out using a 
Nanoindenter (MTS, Nano Indenter XP system) 
with a Berkovich tip and continuous method to 
obtain reduced modulus (Er), and then the 
Oliver-Pharr method was applied to determine 
the elastic modulus (E) of various low-k films 
[9]. 
The chemical makeup and structural 
transformation in the MSQ matrix and 
MSQ/porogen hybrid system as a function of 
temperature were studied using a 
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). 
The measurements were performed using a 
MAGNA-IR Technology Protage 460 (Nicolet 
Inc.) in transmission mode with 32 scans at 
4cm-1 spectral resolution. Chemical bonding 
information of thin film (~ 100 nm) was obtained 
by specular reflectance FTIR (PERKIN, 
PK-100). The thin film samples were spun onto 
Al/Si substrate using Al substrate as a reflective 
mirror. The spectra were collected in 500 ~ 4000 
cm-1 range at a resolution of 2 cm-1. 
Measurements of refractive index and film 
thickness were made using an n&k Analyzer 
1280 (n&k Technology, Inc.) at the wavelengths 
ranging from 190 to 900 nm. The dielectric 
constant (κ) of the film sandwiched between 
electrodes was measured between aluminum 
electrodes at room temperature in ambient by use 
of a Keithley 590 C-V Analyzer with a sweeping 
frequency of 100 kHz. Aluminum electrodes 
with a thickness of 1 µm, but three different dot 
sizes were coated onto dielectric films by 
ULVAC EBX-6D thermal evaporator through a 
shadow mask. 
The morphology and pore size of prepared 
low-k films were investigated by a scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM, JOEL 6500 & 6700) 
with a working voltage of 5 ~ 10 kV. 
Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) was 
employed for quantitative analysis of moisture 
uptake and diffusion of various films. Quartz 
crystal microbalance is extremely sensitive with 
sensitivity in the nano-gram and operated 
according to Sauerbrey’s Equation [10] to 
measure the equilibrium moisture uptake of 
various thin films:

vapor bubbler as schematically illustrated in

100% relative humidity at 30 °C.

III. Results and Discussion 
1. Mechanical properties of hybrid low-k films 
Mechanical strength of low-k dielectric is one 
of significant concern in the backend processing 
steps such as chemical-mechanical polish (CMP) 
and die/packaging interaction. To evaluate the 
applicability of using MSQ/porogen through 
backend processes, elastic modulus was 
its lower mechanical strength even compared to 
those of porous MSQ cured at 400 °C.

Figure 6 FTIR spectra of MSQ films with 
various porogen loading cured at 300 
°C. 
 
In brief, for a porogen loading below a critical 
level, porogen acts as a plasticizer and can 
provide a better mobility for MSQ molecular 
chains to come close and crosslink to form more 
of networking structure. On the other hand, as 
porogen loading increases, the presence of 
porogen becomes a steric barrier for MSQ 
molecular chains, thus reduces the collision 
probability of MSQ molecular chains for further 
crosslinking. FT-IR spectra shown in Figure 6 
provide the network/cage ratios, which correlates 
well with the elastic moduli. The modulus of 
MSQ/porogen film at 0 % porogen is lower than 
films with 10-30 wt % porogen because its 
network/cage ratio is lower due to no 
plasticization in the pure MSQ film at 0% 
porogen. 
In next step, we examine how these novel 
hybrid low-k films will fare during 
chemical-mechanical polish step based on a 
SEMATECH study that a low-k material can 
pass the CMP test if its modulus is lager than 4 
GPa [12]. For porous MSQ films cured directly 
at 400 °C, the modulus of porous film becomes 
lower than 4 GPa when porogen loading is 
higher than 20 wt % (porosity > 15 v%). In 
contrast, hybrid films prepared by novel 
Solid-First scheme, i.e. cured at 300 °C, possess 
modulus > 4 GPa for even larger porogen 
loading, ~ 40 wt % (porosity ~ 35 v%).  That 
means we can use the same matrix and porogen 
to design and produce the ILDs with high 
porosity while the modulus is sufficient to 
survive backend process such as CMP step and 
avoid the barrier reliability issue.

2. Dielectric constant 
Dielectric constant (κ) of each sample was 
calculated by Eq. 1 from the C-V measurement 
results, where d is the film thickness, ε0 is the 
permittivity of vacuum (ε0 = 8.845·10-12), and

The dielectric constant of pure MSQ film was 
2.82 and k values of porous MSQ decreased 
from 2.72 to 2.16 with increasing porosity from

Then, the moisture uptake of 
MSQ/PS-b-P4VP hybrid films cured at 250 °C, 
which could be used as the starting ILD for 
copper damascene process, was studied using 
QCM and shown in Figure 8. The moisture 
uptake of dense MSQ film cured at 250 °C was 
higher than cured at 400 °C because –OH group 
will further crosslink at high temperature, for 
example, 400 °C [14]. The moisture uptake of 
MSQ/PS-b-P4VP hybrid film increased with 
increasing porogen loading. For example, at 10 
wt % loading, the amount of adsorbed water was 
1.67 wt % larger than its corresponding, porous 
film 0.77 wt %. The high uptake level in hybrid 
films is primarily attributed to the much 
increased amount of water sorption in porogen, 
6.7 wt% because the free volume of the linear 
polymer, PS-P4VP is larger than the cross-linked 
MSQ, and PS-P4VP contains polar pyridine 
group, which has higher affinity with moisture. 
The high-temperature porogen in the hybrid 
films behaves like sponge to absorb more 
moisture. 
An ideal mixing rule of moisture uptake was 
applied to the hybrid from MSQ and porogen in 
order to further analyze any other factors 
contributing to the high-level of uptake in the 
hybrid films, according the following 
expression:  
 
wt% hybrid = X * wt% porogen + (1-X) * wt% MSQ 
 
where X is the mass fraction of porogen. The 
moisture uptakes of MSQ/porogen hybrid films 
were much higher than the ideal mixing rule and 
the deviations aggravated with increasing 
porogen loading as shown in Figure 8. In 
addition, the deviation of hybrid films is larger 
than the variance between porous MSQ and their 
HMDS-treated ones. This could be attributed to 
increased level of the residual hydroxide groups 
on the surface of pores of hybrid films which 
were cured at low cure temperature at 250 °C 
without complete crosslinking [13].  
 
4. Moisture diffusion behavior in low-k films 
From manufacturing considerations, it is 
important to understand the diffusion behavior of 
moisture in dense MSQ, porous MSQ and the 
MSQ/porogen hybrids into order to design 
appropriate outgassing pretreatment prior to its 
subsequent processing steps, such as TaN barrier 
and etch-stop layer deposition to avoid any 
delamination caused by tremendous pressure 
from trapped moisture. The absorption curves of 
MSQ and its hybrids were shown in Figure 10.

5. Preliminary results on porogen aggregation 
After curing steps, the open pores were 
observed on the sample surface using SEM 
shown in Figure 14. The most notable difference 
was the pore size distribution of pH-controlled 
films was decreased from 48 ~ 280 nm to 7 ~ 
150 nm with increasing the pH value from 7 to 
11. The pH-controlled films had a better 
dispersion property.

IV. Conclusions 
The high-temperature porogens, PS-b-P4VP 
copolymers and its hybrid (MSQ/porogen) 
system were studied for its mechanical, 
dielectric properties, moisture adsorption, 
moisture diffusion behavior and feasibility in 
different integration schemes including 
Solid-First and state-of-art damascene.  
The mechanical properties of these materials 
used in different integration schemes were 
investigated using nanoindenter and FTIR 
analysis for different porogen loading (porosity). 
The modulus of hybrid films is higher than its 
porous form, and even better than dense one, for 
porogen loading below a critical level, which can 
be attributed to its enhanced degree of 
crosslinking in MSQ matrix due to the 
plasticization by high-temperature porogen. This 
implies that hybrid low-k materials system can 
pass the CMP test while avoiding the barrier 
reliability issue. In addition, more aggressive k 
reduction without failing CMP test can be 
achieved using a hybrid low-k materials system. 
The moisture uptake of these materials used in 
different integration schemes was investigated 
by using a home-built quartz crystal 
microbalance. The moisture uptake of porous

system was recommended to be cured at 300 °C for subsequent 
backend processes, and the porogen to be removed at 400 °C for 2 
hours after CMP step. The mechanical properties of ultra-low-k 
films used in different integration schemes were further 
investigated using nano-indentation and FT-IR for various porogen 
loading. The moduli of 2-phase films were higher than their porous 
films, and even better than dense MSQ, for porogen loading below 
a critical level (~50 %), which could be attributed to their 
enhanced degree of crosslinking in MSQ. In addition, 
MSQ/porogen films cured at 300 °C possessed good elastic 
modulus (> 4.0 GPa) to pass CMP test. 
 
Introduction 
 
Low dielectric constant material (< 3.5) has been introduced into integrated 
devices since 0.13 micron technology node at which RC delay in backend 
interconnects became dominant factor (1). As device technology continues its scaling 
to 45 nm node and beyond, low-k materials with k < 2.5 are being fervently 
developed in order to reduce the increasing RC delay in the backend interconnects. So 
far, it is well recognized that incorporation of porosity is critical to the search of 
viable low-k materials with k < 2.5. The conventional, as-deposited porous low-k 
dielectric is generally formed after deposition of matrix with porogens, then burning 
out of the porogen at higher temperature. However, several showstopper issues related 
to as-deposited porous dielectrics (k < 2.5) have been identified from their process 
integration; namely: (i) device reliability at barrier/low-k interface due to large pore 
size (> 15 Å), (ii) RC variation due to roughness in the dielectric from etching, and 
(iii) its wet chemical compatibility (2). To circumvent these roadblocks, this calls for 
new approach in materials design and its integration. A novel solid-first approach in 
materials and integration has been proposed by Shipley Company to defer the 
formation of lower k, porous dielectric after completing a metal layer, and then 
thermally remove the sacrificial porogen in the two-phase dielectric film (3). But, 
there is little understanding of its materials properties either as-deposited or after the 
removal of porogen, the effect of thermal decomposition temperatures of porogens on 
upper process temperature, and more importantly its interactions with processing 
modules such as chemical-mechanical polish (CMP). 
 
 by a 0.20 µm PTFE filter (Millipore Inc.), then spun onto (100) silicon wafer at 2000 
rpm for 60 seconds at room temperature. The prepared film was then baked at 30, 50, 
80, and 100 °C for 30 min sequentially, then at 150 °C for 8 hours. Then the sample 
was cured in a quartz tube furnace under N2 at a heating rate of 2 °C/min up to 
different final temperatures from 200 to 450 °C with 50 °C interval for 30 min.

Thin film characterization 
 
The study of thermal decomposition temperature of porogens was carried out 
under a nitrogen atmosphere using a TGA Q500 (TA Instruments). The temperature 
scan speed was 10 °C/min and the temperature ranged from 30 to 600 °C. The 
porosities in porous low-k films were measured by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) 
analyzer. The measurements were performed using NOVA 1000e (Quantachrome 
Instruments) with relative pressure (P/P0) from 0 to 1. 
 
The chemical makeup and structural transformation in the MSQ matrix and 
MSQ/porogen 2-phase system as a function of temperature were studied using a 
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The measurements were performed 
using a MAGNA-IR 460 (Nicolet Inc.) in transmission mode with 32 scans at 4 cm-1 
spectral resolution. Measurements of refractive index and film thickness were made 
using an n&k Analyzer 1280 (n&k Technology, Inc.) at the wavelengths ranging from 
190 to 900 nm. 
 
 opposite trend. This indicates the transformation of the cage structure into the network 
structure through thermal curing (13). In addition, the degree on the cross-linking of 
the MSQ was determined by FT-IR analysis to be 50 % at 100 °C and 80 % at 400 °C, 
respectively. The main difference among the MSQ cured at 300, 350 or 400 °C is 
their network/cage structural ratio, which may play a role on their mechanical 
strength.

Then, the decomposition temperatures of porogens and the thermal stability of 
MSQ/porogens and MSQ films were investigated to determine the processing 
temperatures for 2-phase films for dual damascene processing and porogen removal 
when a Cu/low-k layer is completed in solid-first scheme. Thermal gravimetric 
analyses (TGA) showed that the tri-block copolymer porogen, PS-b-PBD-PS (curve 
a), and di-block copolymer porogen, PS-b-P4VP (curve b) had the decomposition 
temperature (Td) at which 2 % weight-loss occurs, about 390 °C and 305 °C and were 
completely removed above 490 and 380 °C under N2 atmosphere, respectively as 
shown in Figure 5. For a porogen/MSQ system using 10 % PS-b-P4VP di-block 
copolymer, the Td was increased to 325 °C as observed in Figure 5 curve c, which 
was higher than the decomposition temperature of pure porogen. This can be 
attributed to the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between N atom of pyridine and 
OH group of MSQ, which in turn delays the decomposition temperature of the 
2-phase system. Since isothermal heating by hot-plate or furnace is commonly used in 
semiconductor fabrication processing, these high-temperature porogens (PS-b-P4VP 
and PS-b-PBD-b-PS) were further confirmed that they can be fully removed at 400 
and 500 °C isothermally for 2 hours, respectively. Such conditions are still reasonable 
for practical applications. 
 
FT-IR was also employed to track any change of porogen in the MSQ/porogen 
films at various temperatures to determine the upper temperature limit of solid-first 
 Isothermal TGA test of pure porogen, PS-b-P4VP, was further carried out at 
300 °C for 30 min as shown in Figure 7. The weight loss of PS-b-P4VP was about 4 
% as temperature was keep at 300 °C. For the rest of this paper, we focus on the thin 
film properties at 300 °C for 2-phase MSQ/PS-b-P4VP films as the starting dielectric 
in solid-first scheme, and at 400 °C for porous low-k after the removal of porogen. 
The insert in Figure 8 shows the relationship between porogen loading and porosity as 
measured by BET. The porosity of low-k films increased from 6.5 to 36.4 % as the 
porogen loading increased from 10 to 40 %. The refractive indices of porous films 
versus porosity were shown in Figure 8. The refractive index of porous film decreased 
linearly from 1.38 to 1.20 as the porosity increased from 0 to 37 %. Table I 
summarized the refractive index (n), optical dielectric constant by Maxwell relation 
(εfilm = n2) and ideal mixing rule [εfilm= (1-φ) εMSQ + φεporogen, where φ is the volume 
fraction of porogen] for porous films with various porosities. The linearity deviates 
significantly at porosity larger than 36.4 % presumably due to interconnected pores or 
changed pore morphology.

In order to accurately measure the dielectric constant by C-V dot measurement, 
three circular aluminum dots with nominal 200, 400, and 800 µm diameter were 
prepared onto MSQ/porogen films cured at 300 °C. CV dots were further heated at 
400 °C to form porous films prior to electric measurement as shown in Figure 9 for 20 
 Table II summarized porogen loading, porosity, the C/A, film thickness (d), and 
dielectric constants for porogen loading between 0 and 40 %. The dielectric constants 
of MSQ films with various porosities were shown in Figure 10. The dielectric 
constant (k) of pure MSQ film was 2.82 and k values of porous MSQ decreased from 
2.72 to 2.16 with increasing porosity from 6.5 to 36.4 %. The deviation of dielectric 
constant by C-V measurement from the estimated value by ideal mixing rule 
aggravated with increasing porosity. This implies that the pore morphology may 
change to connected pores and its internal surface area may contribute to the 
increased moisture uptake, which in turn raises the dielectric constant.

Mechanical strength of low-k dielectric is one of significant concern in the 
backend processing steps such as chemical-mechanical polish (CMP) and 
die/packaging interaction. To evaluate the applicability of using MSQ/porogen 
through backend processes, elastic modulus was measured using nanoindentation 
technique. The elastic moduli of three low-k materials systems, MSQ at 400 °C and 
MSQ/PS-b-P4VP at 300 and 400 °C, were shown in Figure 11. The moduli of the 
porous films cured at 400 °C decreased with increasing porosity. Furthermore, for 
2-phase films cured at 300 °C, the modulus for film with 10 % porogen, 5.4 GPa, was 
much higher than that of pure MSQ, 3.5 GPa, and then the modulus decreased with 
increasing the porogen (PS-b-P4VP) loading from 10 to 60 %. In general, 2-phase 
films cured at 300 °C were stronger than those of porous MSQ with 10 to 50 % 
porogen loading. The incorporation of porosity into dense low-k materials lowers its

 Similar FT-IR analysis was carried out for 300 °C cured 2-phase films with 
various porogen loadings as shown in Figure 13. Specifically, the network/cage 
structural ratios were plotted in Figure 14. The ratio increased from 1.25 for pure 
MSQ at 300 °C to 1.45 for 10 % loading, which correlated well with the significant 
increase of mechanical strength shown in Figure 14, presumably due to the increase in 
the degree of crosslinking.  For loading above 10 %, network/cage structural ratio 
decreased from 1.45 to 1.12 with increasing the porogen loading between 10 % and 
60 %, which confirmed the corresponding trend of modulus shown in Figures 11 and 
14. For a porogen loading below a critical quantity (~50 % for PS-b-P4VP), porogen 
may act as a plasticizer, which can provide a better mobility for MSQ molecular 
chains to come close and crosslink to form more of cage structure. As porogen 
loading increases above a critical value, the presence of porogen becomes a steric 
barrier for MSQ molecular chains, thus reduces the collision probability of MSQ 
molecular chains for further crosslinking. Therefore, the reduced degree of 
crosslinking in MSQ with porogen loading greater than 50 % can be accounted for its 
lower mechanical strength even compared to those of porous MSQ cured at 400 °C.

range of 950 ~ 1350 cm-1. 
 
Finally we examined how these novel 2-phase low-k films would fare during 
chemical-mechanical polish step based on a SEMATECH study that a low-k material 
could pass the CMP test if its modulus is lager than 4 GPa (15). For porous MSQ 
films cured directly at 400 °C, the modulus of porous film became lower than 4 GPa 
when porogen loading was higher than 20 % (porosity > 15 %). In contrast, 2-phase 
films prepared by novel solid-first scheme, i.e. cured at 300 °C, possessed modulus 
higher than 4 GPa for even larger porogen loading, ~ 40 % (porosity ~ 35 %).  That 
means we can use the same matrix and porogen to design and produce the ILDs with 
high porosity while the modulus is sufficient to survive backend process such as CMP 
step using solid-first scheme, meanwhile avoiding the barrier reliability issue.
