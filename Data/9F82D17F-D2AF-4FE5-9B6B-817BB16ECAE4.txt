“Abstract.” 
 
The aim of this project has been to answer the 
question: how to embed sentiment into 
materials?  
 
Materials touch every part of human existence 
and each day individuals come into contact with 
multitudes of manufactured objects that are 
essential to modern life.  Materiality can affect 
how we ‘sense’ and ‘perceive’ our surroundings.  
Advances in Materials Science are making it 
possible for designers to interact with processes 
once primarily associated with industry— 
materials can offer enormous potential in 
exploring the relationships of surface, structure 
and form and; from a design perspective, the 
richness ‘materiality’ offers can assist advanced 
design thinking and practice. 
  
The research method has been based on a 
dynamic design approach— Action Research 
Method.  This work seeks out, through the 
exploration of Materials Science and digital 
technologies, potential characteristics that may 
furnish ‘sentiment’ or ‘empathy’ in materials, to 
facilitate communication between materiality 
(artifacts) and individuals at an emotional level.  
The work has also embraced Bio-inspiration, and 
delved into nature’s tactile and narrative layers, to 
create new forms of experience and perception 
that invite reflection and contemplation.  
 
In conclusion, to date, metaphors have been the 
most noticeable way of describing how empathy 
can be ‘achieved’ in design creations.  However, 
this research has found that in order to create 
designs using materials that embed sentiment, 
interaction with people on a ‘human’ level is 
required to evoke a sense of curiosity as well as 
expectation.

and developed in a public, collaborative manner. 
We see materials as an open resource, and wish 
to establish an open process for exploring and 
sharing knowledge, techniques and applications 
related to materials science”. [2]  
 
Materials Science broadly encompasses the 
fundamental study of solid matter with the goal 
of engineering new materials with superior 
properties, and ultimately enabling altogether 
new types of devices.  Previously, Materials 
Science focused on metallurgical and ceramic 
systems, and the state of technological 
achievement of ancient (European) societies has 
been described in terms of materials— the ‘stone’ 
age, the ‘bronze’ age and the ‘iron’ age.  In the 
modern era, Materials Science makes use of 
advanced fabrication and characterisation tools 
that allow the observation and manipulation of  
‘matter’ virtually atom-by-atom.  This field is 
inherently interdisciplinary, with strong 
connections to physics, chemistry, biology and 
the engineering fields.  One affiliating subject is 
the link between structure and material 
properties.  By understanding structure at the 
right scale, corresponding properties such as 
colour, strength, smoothness or magnetism can 
be controlled, and there are hundreds of new 
materials produced every year: some mundane, 
such as new aluminum alloys for the car industry; 
and some miraculous such as silicon chips, glass 
that cleans itself, polymers that self-heal, 
transparent concrete and digital paper.  Others 
are highly creative such as BioCouture, which 
aims to address ecological and sustainability 
issues around fashion; or Fabrican: a patented 
instant, sprayable, non-woven fabric in an aerosol 
can, developed through a collaboration between 
Imperial College London and the Royal College 
of Art. [3] 
 
“Aware of the slow 
process of constructing 
garments, Manel Torres 
investigated novel ways to 
speed up this process. 
Manel's foresight and 
vision led him to think of 
developing a material that 
would almost magically fit 
the body like a second 
skin and at the same time 
have the appearance of 
clothing.” 
Fabrican. 
Manel Torres, 1995 – 1997 [3] 
 
The fabric is formed by the cross-linking of fibres, 
which adhere to one another, to create an instant non-
woven fabric that can be easily sprayed on to any 
surface.  Its properties can be tailored to meet the 
needs of each user.   
Technology Transfer. 
Advanced materials or processes originally 
developed for space travel, military purposes or 
model building, offer designers a wide range of 
new applications.  The phenomenon of 
technology transfer, whereby materials and 
techniques, developed for a specific purpose are 
suddenly ‘discovered’ and applied to a completely 
different sector, has undoubtedly been boosted 
by the Internet.  In the field of textiles, for 
example, the best source of inspiration for 
technology transfer is the ‘Techtextil’ in 
Frankfurt, one of the biggest trade fairs for 
technical textiles.  Techtextil is organised around 
categories such as Medtech, Hometech, 
Clothtech or Buildtech and is a playground for 
designers, including architects who will find a 
textile for just about every application— facades, 
ceilings, safety barriers, screens, carpets, roofing, 
construction and furniture— employed either in 
a flexible state or as reinforcement in a hardened 
construction. 
The diversity of contemporary textiles, whether 
it be raw material, fibres or technical processes, is 
enormous, and in recent years, interest in the 
functional properties of textiles has burgeoned 
thanks to developments in two areas: smart 
textiles and nanotechnology.  Significantly, it is 
now possible to give textiles completely new 
functional properties by adding electronic 
components- from musical equipment and 
 4 
several metals that have low density, hardness, 
and melting points, these are extremely reactive, 
and are rarely encountered in their elemental, 
metallic form.  Visually, metals are opaque, shiny 
and lustrous due to visible lightwaves that are not 
readily transmitted through the bulk of their 
microstructure.  
 
The majority of metals have higher densities than 
the majority of nonmetals [8] nonetheless; there 
is wide variation in their densities; with the 
highest kind being due to their tightly packed 
crystal lattice of the metallic structure.  The 
electrical and thermal conductivity of metals 
originate from the fact that in the metallic bond, 
the outer electrons of the metal atoms form a gas 
of nearly free electrons, moving as an electron gas 
in a background of positive charge formed by the 
ion cores and when considering the exact band 
structure and binding energy of a metal, it is 
necessary to take into account the positive 
potential caused by the specific arrangement of 
the ion cores which is periodic in crystals.  
Mechanical properties of metals include ductility: 
the mechanical property that describes the extent 
in which solid materials can be plastically 
deformed without fracture.   
 
  
Metal Textiles: Flexible Metal Brick [9] 
 
Available in two different aluminum alloys, untreated or 
treated for corrosion, expanded or unexpanded, and 
engineered to flex backwards and forwards, when flat, 
this material looks and feels like a solid block of metal. 
Flexible Metal Brick’s maximum achievable length (in 
one part) is approximately 150mm.  Its length limitation 
is due to the opening of the press used to make the 
material and there is a limit on how many foils that can 
be placed onto each other as after a certain number 
they become too large for the press.  Applied as a 
lightweight, structural material in many different 
industries (mainly to manufacture composite panels), 
aluminum honeycomb is produced by placing a large 
number of aluminum foils (2000mm length x 1025mm 
width x 0.07mm foil thickness onto which adhesive 
node lines have been printed. [9]   
 
 
Significantly, metal textiles are now able to 
absorb, store and release heat in response to body 
temperature and the company Outlast®, the 
worldwide pioneer for the research, 
development, design and marketing of phase 
change materials (PCM), [10] is one example of 
their application to products, in this case Ski 
apparel and outerwear. 
 
Fundamental to material innovations are the 
advances in fibres.  The engineering of fibres has 
accelerated over the past decade. The twentieth 
century saw the transformation of fibres from 
natural fibres (such as cotton and wool) to the 
early synthetics (nylon and polyester), to blending 
of fibres, development of advanced next 
generation fibres such as glass, arimids (Kevlar) 
and carbon.  Combined with this is the 
emergence of hybrid fibres, textile composites 
and textile membranes resulting in high strength, 
low weight materials that potentially perform 
better than conventional materials. [11] 
 
Fibre Optics 
An ‘optical fibre’ is a thin, flexible, transparent 
fibre that acts as a waveguide to transmit light 
between its two ends.  The field of applied 
science and engineering, concerned with the 
design and application of optical fibres, is known 
as fibre optics.  Optical fibres are widely used in 
fibre-optic communications, which permits 
transmission over longer distances and at higher 
bandwidths (data rates) than other forms of 
communication.  Fibres are used instead of metal 
wires because signals travel along them with less 
loss and are also immune to electromagnetic 
interference.  Fibres are also used for 
illumination, and are wrapped in bundles so they 
can be used to carry images, thus allowing viewing 
in tight spaces.  Specially designed fibres are used 
for a variety of other applications, including 
sensors, fibre lasers and lighting.

Composites. 
Composite materials are combinations which can 
be as simple as concrete reinforced with steel 
bars or cutting edge such as ultralight carbon-
fibre.  Often shortened to ‘composites’, they are 
engineered or naturally occurring materials made 
from two or more constituent materials, with 
significantly different physical or chemical 
properties, which remain separate and distinct at 
the macroscopic or microscopic scale within the 
finished structure.  The places where different 
materials meet— the interfaces, can often 
produce new properties and results that are 
radically different, and/or better, than those in 
any single material and one such example of this 
kind of hybridisation is ‘Washi’ laminated glass. 
Japanese artisans have been making ‘Washi’ for 
over 500 years and today, technicians have 
applied the same handcraft techniques in the 
manufacture of ‘Washi Laminated Glass’, which 
is a panel composed of a combination of two glass 
sheets that ‘sandwich’ handmade Japanese Washi 
parchment with one interlayer of plastic (PVB).  
Made from sustainably harvested inner white 
bark fibre, the Washi parchment fibres are 
stripped, cleaned, pounded and stretched, mixed 
in a solution made from ‘tororo-aoi’ (a variety of 
sticky mountain potato) and then spread thinly 
and evenly across bamboo screens.  When dry, 
the resulting paper is both durable and beautiful; 
and when composited with glass and PVB 
combine artisanal expertise with practicality in a 
very aesthetic manner. 
  
Composite Material: Washi Laminated Glass. 
Washi laminated glass panel is a combination of two 
glass sheets with handmade Japanese washi parchment 
and one interlayer of plastic (PVB).  The hybrid 
material is used for both security and decorative 
applications, and demonstrates the marriage of a 500-
year-old handcraft-based tradition with modern 
technology. 
 
 
Biomaterials. 
Biomaterials are generally produced either in 
nature or synthesised in a laboratory by using a 
variety of chemical approaches utilising metallic 
components or ceramics.  They are often used 
and/or adapted for medical applications, and thus 
comprise whole or part of a living structure or 
biomedical device which performs, augments, or 
replaces a natural function.  Biomaterials are also 
used every day in dental applications, surgery and 
drug delivery.   
 
BioCouture, initiated by Senior Research Fellow 
Suzanne Lee, at Central St Martins, University of 
the Arts London, has collaborated with scientists 
Professor Paul Freemont, a synthetic biologist, 
and Professor Alexander Bismarck, a chemical 
engineer to unite design with cutting edge bio 
and nano-technologies to harness nature. 
Through investigating the use of microbial-
cellulose, grown in a laboratory, to produce 
clothing, the project’s ultimate goal was to 
literally grow a dress in a vat of liquid.  The 
process, which uses a ‘sugary’ green tea recipe, to 
which, a bacterial culture is added, takes 
approximately 2— 4 weeks to grow a sheet (thick 
enough to use) and when ready are dried and 
shaped over a wooden dress form, like the Ghost 
Dress, or sewn together conventionally.  
Depending on the recipe the resulting material 
can either feel like paper or vegetable leather. [13]

that are essential to modern life— vehicles, 
clothing, machines, sport and leisure equipment, 
computers and telephones, even medical 
technology.  Everything we ‘see’ and ‘use’ is made 
from materials derived from the earth: metals, 
polymers, ceramics, semiconductors and 
composites.  
 
Materials Science involves the study of the 
structure, properties and behaviour of all 
materials, the development of processes to 
manufacture useful products from them, and now 
importantly, research into recycling and 
environmentally friendly disposal.  The central 
concept in Materials Science is that the 
properties and behaviour of every material is 
dependant on its microstructure, and that 
microstructure can be controlled by the way in 
which the material is made and processed.  
The technological advances that have 
transformed our world over the last 20 years have 
been founded on developments in Materials 
Science and materials are evolving to enable 
engineers and scientists to improve the 
performance of existing products and to develop 
innovative technologies that will enhance every 
aspect of our lives.  Materials Science has become 
a key discipline in the competitive global 
economy and significantly has become a ‘key’ 
component for designers in creating new and 
meaningful artefacts and ‘design conversations’. 
A literature review of this diverse field has 
suggested many potential applications; 
nonetheless the practical application and 
experimentation of materials and techniques has 
yielded more quality data, in terms of tangible 
results, in seeking the answer to the question: 
how to embed sentiment into materials?  
Engaging directly with materiality, this work has 
experimented with 13 different kinds of materials 
and associated treatments and/or techniques 
ranging from oxidisation to ceramics and glazing 
to concrete and fibre optics.  Each set of 
experiments were photographically documented 
and evaluated to elicit potential and relevant 
characteristics that could be applied to design 
work.  In particular, the wide investigation of 
ceramics and polymers yielded the richest results 
and these were applied to two designs: ‘Venus 
Bowl’ and ‘Invisible Window’, respectively. In 
exploring the boundaries between technology and 
materials, the motif of fragility was explored in 
Venus Bowl— a hand-thrown ceramic vessel 
whose outer wrapper, created by woven fibre-
optic threads appears to be brittle, but embodies 
a delicate strength and authority through its 
ceramic material and ephemeral glaze.

To create this luminescent glow, a combination of snow 
glaze, lustre and metal glaze and clear dipping glaze 
were combined. 
 
Semi-transparent and glowing with light, 
Invisible Window envisions a conceptual and 
computational aesthetic framework for the 
technology of visual transfer and materiality 
within architectural spaces, with a focus on how 
we 'sense' space visually to shape our tactile and 
physical impressions.  The success of this work’s 
visual impact is underwritten by the use of 
polymers (transparent sheet acrylic) which were 
laser cut, laser engraved and treated with 
Cyanoacrylate (a fast-acting adhesive) to create an 
authentic-looking aged and weathered wooden 
window; and when presented in conjunction with 
a projected light source created the (invisible) 
illusion of a ‘real’ window.

intuitive and poetic view; sometimes these 
viewpoints overlap.  R+D is a critical part of 
developing new products; it is also an arena where 
mistakes are permitted.  Knowledge drives 
economy.  Knowledge and innovation have 
become the most powerful tools for 
strengthening national competitiveness. 
Increasingly knowledge-based economy, 
technological innovation— the capacity to apply 
new knowledge to improve productivity and 
create new products and services— is more 
significant than ever.  This capacity relies not 
only on scientific inventiveness and 
entrepreneurial flair but also, critically, on the 
conditions, which permit, encourage and sustain 
the innovative creativity, or restrict it. [15] 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.2 “Liminal Spaces 
And Non-Places.” 
 
Sharon Zukin applied the term to urban studies, 
proposing that ‘liminal’ space is a growing 
character of the contemporary city, and that the 
localism, or neighbourhood urbanism, of the 
modern city has been transformed into post-
modern transitional space. [16]  This space is 
betwixt and between economic institutions and is 
best described by the adjective ‘liminal’ because it 
complicates the effort to construct identity.  
Liminal spaces are ambiguous and ambivalent; 
they slip between global markets and local places, 
between public use and private value, between 
work and home, between commerce and culture. 
 
‘As both site and sight, meeting place and social 
staging ground, public spaces enable us to 
conceptualize and represent the city— to make 
an ideology of its receptivity to strangers, 
tolerance of difference, and opportunities to 
enter a fully socialized life, both civic and 
commercial. We can understand what is 
happening to our public culture today if we look 
at what is happening to public spaces’. [16] 
 
A recent article in the online magazine Stylepark 
reviews the design of Rafael Viñoly, a US 
architect who was commissioned to create a new 
public space: an airport hall near Montevideo in 
Uruguay: “The colors white and silver gray 
predominates; as for the materials, glass, metal 
and polished stone stand out particularly”. [17] 
 
 
Carrasco International Airport new airport 
building near Montevideo, Uruguay. 
Rafael Viñoly, 2009 
 
 
 
 
 
With the brief to produce a contemporary 
architectural symbol that would cater to the 
needs of the flourishing tourist industry as well as 
reflecting the growing importance of the capital 
as a banking and trade centre, Rafael Viñoly is 
the architect behind the newest airport hall in 
Montevideo.  It is yet another masterpiece of 21st 
century engineering, however its glazed walls, 
metal framework and over-use of high-tech 
materials still remain consistent with the 
continuing trend for architects to create 
stereotype, generic ‘non-places’ which result in 
ambiguity, loss of culture and ‘liminal’ spaces. 
 
Uruguayan culture is diverse in its nature since 
the nation's population is one of multicultural 
origins.  The country has an impressive legacy of 
artistic and literary traditions considering its 
small population size of approximately 3,372,000 
[18] and the contribution of its alternating 
conquerors, Spain and Portugal, and diverse 
immigrants -Italians, Germans, Swiss, Russians, 
Jews and Armenians, among others- has resulted 
in traditions that integrate this diversity with 
Native American elements. Given this rich 
history, there are no obvious clues to 
differentiate this airport terminal (culturally) 
from many other similar international structures; 
 12 
Anthropology of Supermodernity’.  In his book, 
Augé argues that more and more of our lives is 
now spent in supermarkets, airports and hotels, 
in front of computers or at cash machines and 
that this colonisation of our world by ‘non-places’ 
changes us in subtle ways: how we perceive non-
places, and how that perception changes 
ourselves and those places.  Motivated by these 
theories, this project has sought to create design 
concepts inspired by Augé’s inquiry and Sharon 
Zukin’s critique.   
 
A relevant, and noteworthy, project that has 
informed this work is ‘The Intelligent Street: 
Responsive Sound Environments for Social 
Interaction.’  Executed by Henrik Lörstad, Mark 
d’Inverno and John Eacott, this research project 
is a music installation that is able to respond 
intelligently to the collective requests of users 
interacting together.  The performance it creates 
is largely influenced by the collective set of text 
commands from users' mobile phones.  In this 
way, users in shared environments subjugated for 
so long to uncontrollable, and often undesired, 
`Muzak', can directly influence their sonic 
environment and collectively create the aural 
soundscape that they desire. [23]  Viewing the 
project as the ‘enabling’ of inhabitants of any 
given space, from passive consumers to active 
creators to ‘take control’, it has significant social, 
educational (and commercial) potential. 
 
The use of music (or Muzak!) in public places is 
extremely common.  However, any individual 
within that space has absolutely no control over 
the performance of that music, and it can often 
become intrusive and unwelcome. [23]  
Interestingly, interactive and responsive sound 
installations, where the performance resulted 
directly from interaction of users within a given 
space, were created.  Pre-composed pieces of 
music, written algorithmically, by Olofsson, 
Lörstad and Eacott were restructured, combined, 
manipulated and then processed as determined 
by users' commands to essentially translate text 
messages into musical operations— users’ text 
commands could affect the mood, energy and 
style of the music and thus the installation 
reflected the desires of those around it.   And 
adding a splash of humour, the commands chosen 
to feed to the system and alter the music were 
those specifically thought out to be ‘non-musical’ 
terms, for example a command such as ‘cheese’ 
would offer the user the option of freely 
associating ‘what’ the word meant to them, as 
opposed to building up the expectations a 
musical term would generally suggest.  
 
With an emphasis on exploring ways of inviting 
people to participate in creating interactive 
sound art and new ways of utilising mobile phone 
technology, The Intelligent Street project has 
used technology and environment or ‘space’ as an 
art interface to nurture a more meaningful 
relationship between individuals and their 
immediate surroundings.  Shared environments 
should be designed to encourage all kinds of 
social interaction— from artefacts created to 
encourage empathetic interaction between 
people and ‘space’ to environmental issues such as 
heat, light or sound.  One consequence of 
technological advances is that we can imbue 
everyday objects and ‘spaces’ with processing 
power where computational entities are 
interwoven into the fabric of our lives to satiate 
the comfort we all need. 
 
 
2.3 “The Natural 
World.” 
 
“A great thunderstorm; an 
extensive flood; a desolating 
hurricane; a sudden and intense 
frost; an overwhelming 
snowstorm; a sultry day, - each of 
these different scenes exhibits 
singular beauties even in spite of 
the damage they cause. Often 
whilst the heart laments the loss 
to the citizen, the enlightened 
mind, seeking for the natural 
causes, and astonished at the 
effects, awakes itself to surprise and 
wonder”. [24] 
 
Growth is a process that can be influenced by the 
external conditions including temperature, 
mechanical loading, and supply of light, water or 
nutrition. A living organism must necessarily 
possess the ability of adaptation to external 
needs, while possible external influences on a 
technical system must be typically anticipated in 
its design, often leading to considerable ‘over-
 14 
compositions of pigments, Artist Kate Nichols 
first investigated the wing structures of the Blue 
Morpho butterfly in order to find a method of 
incorporating the phenomenon into her artwork. 
Many Morpho butterflies are coloured in 
metallic, shimmering shades of blue and green.  
These colours are not a result of pigmentation 
but are an example of iridescence— the 
microscopic scales covering the Morpho's wings 
reflect incident light repeatedly at successive 
layers, leading to interference effects that depend 
on both wavelength and angle of 
incidence/observance.  Thus the colours 
produced vary with viewing angle, however they 
are actually surprisingly uniform, perhaps due to 
the tetrahedral (diamond-like) structural 
arrangement of the scales or diffraction from 
overlying cell layers.  The lamellate structure of 
their wing scales has been studied as a model in 
the development of fabrics, dye-free paints and 
anti-counterfeit technology used in currency. [28] 
One way to achieve structural colour is by 
constructing thin, multilayered surfaces, much 
like a Flemish oil-painting technique which 
carefully overlaps up to 20 or 30 layers in a single 
painting, allowing light to briefly permeate and 
‘dance’ among the pigments; however Nichols 
found in her research that the thinnest layers of 
oil paint were orders of magnitude too thick to 
create true structural colour, therefore she 
engaged is a series of experiments conducted in 
Paul Alivisatos’ Nanotechnology Research 
Group’s Lab at the University of California, 
Berkeley. 
  
The Blue Morpho butterfly. 
The Menelaus Blue Morpho (Morpho menelaus) is an 
iridescent tropical butterfly of Central and South 
America. It has a wingspan of six inches (15 cm). [28] 
 
 
Nichols’ research experimented with silver 
nanoparticles which over time transformed into 
an even, turquoise hue; however ‘trapped’ 
molecules knocked into nanoparticles, gradually 
rounding their corners, transforming them from 
triangles to discs, and subsequently turned the 
matter into a royal blue before settling at the 
bottom of the solution.  Disillusioned by a lack of 
tangible results Nichols decided to let the 
nanoparticles act ‘naturally’, or in other words 
find level.  Therefore glass capillary tubes were 
filled with solutions of nanoparticles and sealed 
in a vacuum.  Plates backed by a sheet of 
mirrored silver, were coated with silver 
nanoparticles and stacked on top of each other 
and when combined created a unique and 
engaging study of nanoparticles.  While pigments 
work by reflecting certain wavelengths of light 
and absorbing others, the silver nanoparticles 
reflect blue light while transmitting red, orange, 
and yellow.  The transmitted light is in turn 
reflected back to the viewer, so the dominant 
colour of the piece changes depending on the 
colour of the incoming light, or even on what—or 
who—is in front of it.

part of their charm."

This work is an excellent example of multi-
disciplinary research, that is, in this case, the 
combination of two disciplines— art and science.  
The simultaneously imaginative and analytical 
processes have underlined creativity through a 
process that has mixed two ways of thinking— 
firstly an aesthetic process embracing uncertainty 
and ambiguity; and the second an analytical 
course of action that reduced its challenges to 
resolvable problems.

Novel Forms. 
Creative use of technology in the arts has 
provided a huge amount of research and 
development into new creative applications.  In 
dance for example, motion tracking and gesture 
recognition using computer vision, mechanical 
motion capture devices and force sensors such as 
accelerometer have not just enabled new artistic 
expression but also revealed the otherwise 
unexplored potential of these technologies 
beyond the confines of more rigid HCI research.

enlightening choreography and the genius of 
interactive software creator Frieder Weiss.  After 
research and development into the various 
relationships between bodies in motion with 
moving graphics using an infrared camera system, 
Obarzanek was able to create a kind of ‘biotech 
physics’ that changed the body in other imaginary 
grotesque and sensual conditions, where on the 
stage bodies and lights permeate each other.  The 
light ‘created’ is different in appearance, to that 
of the body, and can tremble when the dancer’s 
body trembles, shrink when the dancer shrinks 
his body, but also expand when the dancer’s body 
is stretched. 
 
The use of technology here is not simply a stage 
decoration, but a key player which paints the 
body and stage with the power of its light, which 
play on the stage, creating magical images for the 
eyes and thoughts of the audience.

Action Research’ [31] which provides a 
comprehensive overview of six key principles. 
 
1.  Reflexive Critique. 
An account of a situation, such as notes, 
transcripts or official documents, will make 
implicit claims to be authoritative, i.e., it implies 
that it is factual and true.  Truth in a social 
setting, however, is relative to the teller.  The 
principle of reflective critique ensures people 
reflect on issues and processes and make explicit 
the interpretations, biases, assumptions and 
concerns upon which judgments are made.  In 
this way, practical accounts can give rise to 
theoretical considerations. 
 
 
 
2.  Dialectical Critique. 
Reality, particularly social reality, is consensually 
validated, which is to say it is shared through 
language.  Phenomena are conceptualized in 
dialogue; therefore a dialectical critique is 
required to understand the set of relationships 
both between the phenomenon and its context, 
and between the elements constituting the 
phenomenon.  The key elements to focus 
attention on are those constituent elements that 
are unstable, or in opposition to one 
another.  These are the ones that are most likely 
to create changes. 
 
3.  Collaborative Resource. 
Participants in an action research project are co-
researchers.  The principle of collaborative 
resource presupposes that each person’s ideas are 
equally significant as potential resources for 
creating interpretive categories of analysis, 
negotiated among the participants.  It strives to 
avoid the skewing of credibility stemming from 
the prior status of an idea-holder.  It especially 
makes possible the insights gleaned from noting 
the contradictions both between many 
viewpoints and within a single viewpoint 
 
4.  Risk. 
The change process potentially threatens all 
previously established ways of doing things, thus 
creating psychic fears among the 
practitioners.  One of the more prominent fears 
comes from the risk to ego stemming from open 
discussion of one’s interpretations, ideas, and 
judgments.  Initiators of action research will use 
this principle to allay others’ fears and invite 
participation by pointing out that they, too, will 
be subject to the same process, and that whatever 
the outcome, learning will take place. 
 
5.  Plural Structure. 
The nature of the research embodies a 
multiplicity of views, commentaries and critiques, 
leading to multiple possible actions and 
interpretations.  This plural structure of inquiry 
requires a plural text for reporting.  This means 
that there will be many accounts made explicit, 
with commentaries on their contradictions, and a 
range of options for action presented.  A report, 
therefore, acts as a support for ongoing 
discussion among collaborators, rather than a 
final conclusion of fact. 
6.  Theory, Practice, Transformation. 
For action researchers, theory informs practice, 
practice refines theory, in a continuous 
transformation.  In any setting, people’s actions 
are based on implicitly held assumptions, theories 
and hypotheses, and with every observed result, 
theoretical knowledge is enhanced.  The two are 
intertwined aspects of a single change 
process.  It is up to the researchers to make 
explicit the theoretical justifications for the 
actions, and to question the bases of those 
justifications.  The ensuing practical 
applications that follow are subjected to further 
analysis, in a transformative cycle that 
continuously alternates emphasis between theory 
and practice. [31] 
 
Complementary to Action Research Method, 
Phenomenology, a qualitative research 
methodology, within the interpretivist paradigm, 
that investigates, from the first-person point of 
view, the qualitatively different ways individuals 
conceptualise various phenomena in the world 
around them has been exercised.  By literally 
studying ‘phenomena’: appearances of things, or 
things as they appear in our experience, or the 
ways we experience things, the meanings things 
have in our experience have significance. 
 
The historical movement of Phenomenology is 
the philosophical tradition launched in the first 
half of the 20th century by Edmund Husserl, 
Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Jean-
Paul Sartre, et al.  We all experience various types

Workshop Objectives. 
The powerful combination of technology and 
‘materials’, and their various applications has 
transformed the nature of design and practice by 
communicating visual information more 
effectively and more often, therefore accordingly, 
designers and students must engage with both, 
parallel with, and complementary to, established 
conventions in design education practice. 
 
Ongoing global changes bring new challenges 
requiring new concepts and tools.  International 
and multi-disciplinary participation are key 
elements within the wider global design 
community, when responding to design issues, 
and require fresh perspectives and approaches.  
The key objective underpinning the ‘Tangible 
Interfaces Workshop’, was the introduction and 
exploration of materiality beyond its typical 
scope, and the three objectives are listed below: 
 
i) To provide a platform for designers, students 
and practitioners from diverse areas of the design 
industry with an multi-disciplinary forum to 
explore materiality, in terms of novel methods 
and techniques, and their potential applications. 
 
ii) To question the limitations of known 
approaches and glean new insight into materials 
exploration. 
 
iii) To apply materials’ exploration research and 
results to answer the question: how can 
sentiment be embedded into materials? 
 
Workshop Execution Method. 
With a fertile mindset, the Tangible Interfaces 
Workshop sought to challenge the contemporary 
and social aspects of ‘design,’ ‘culture’ and 
‘handcraft’ by pushing the boundaries of 
established design clichés through the innovative 
use of materials.  The relationships between 
surface, form, materiality and applied digital 
technology were considered integral to the 
workshop’s success in order to yield first-rate 
diversified results.  Students in the Media+Visual 
Communication Department, Chang Gung 
University, were organised into 9 groups.  Eight 
groups were each led by one MVC final year 
student, and a team of two headed one group.  
Assuming the role of ‘Creative Director’ each 
group leader/s defined himself or herself as a 
designer and future decision-maker.  Throughout 
the week students ‘thought’ and worked 
collaboratively to rationalise diverse concepts. 
 
Over the course of 5 consecutive days, MVC 
students were requested to respond visually, in 
the form of a three-dimensional installation, to 
the question: how can sentiment be embedded 
into materials?  As a source of inspiration, 
education and direction, two guest practitioners 
were invited to deliver presentations relating to 
their areas of expertise.  Additionally, invited 
guest practitioner Alessia Giardino and MVC 
faculty members gave daily tutorials and feedback 
to students concerning their ideas.  Concluding 
on day 5, each workshop group presented their 
finished design concepts, in the form of a three 
dimensional installation, with an accompanying 
online diary that included photographic 
documentation of the ‘whole’ process. 
 
 
4.1.1 “Guest 
Practitioners.” 
 
Two guest ‘artist’ practitioners were invited from 
diverse areas of practice, the first — Professor 
Lin, Pey Chwen an internationally acclaimed 
Digital Artist who has exhibited her work around 
the world.  The Director of the Digital Art 
Laboratory in the Department of Multimedia and 
Animation Arts at National Taiwan University of 
Arts, Professor Lin has participated in many 
contemporary art and digital art forums in 
Taiwan as a keynote speaker and juror. 
 
And the second— Alessia Giardino, Surface and 
Textile Designer, a graduate from London’s 
prestigious MA Textile Futures course at Central 
St Martins College of Art and Design; who 
foregrounds materials’ innovations by 
highlighting their sensorial and aesthetic features.  
Alessia Giardino’s pieces have been selected and 
exhibited with Nissan Design Europe at Salone 
del Mobile, Milan and databased in international 
materials’ archives such as Materia and IOM3: 
The Institute of Materials, London. 
 
These two diverse practitioners were selected in 
order to exemplify this workshop’s wide-ranging 
 22 
connection with our environment.  Intricate patterns of 
laser-cut wood are embossed into concrete and left 
until they begin to peel off and decompose due to 
pollution and weathering.  Creating a shadow, lace-like 
effect as they distort and bend, they finally fall off, 
leaving a permanent trace in the concrete surface and 
when applied vertically, the peeling wood creates a 
beautiful shadow, and suggests the idea of a three 
dimensional ‘living surface’.

Student Team Collaboration. 
Team collaboration is a process of participation 
through which individuals or groups and 
organisations work together to achieve desired 
results.  By working collaboratively with team 
members, results yielded will strengthen a 
project’s mission, vision and values; and 
importantly help to transform core results into a 
tangible result.  In industry, collaboration 
partners serve as an important bridge between 
innovation, research, and management; therefore 
it has been critical to the workshop’s success that 
student participants worked cohesively as a group 
to realise their concepts. 
 
 
Media+Visual Communication Department 
students were organised into 9 mixed-year 
teams.  An MVC final year student representing their 
design studio headed each team.

During day three of the workshop, students 
experimented with materials to investigate, 
develop and extract potential applications from 
the kaleidoscope of possibilities.  ‘Sizing’ or ‘size’ 
is any one of numerous specific substances that is 
applied to or incorporated in other material, 
especially papers and textiles, to act as a 
protecting filler or glaze.  Sizing is used in 
papermaking and textile manufacturing to change 
the absorption and wear characteristics of those 
materials; it is also used as a surface preparation 
for gilding; and painters and artists to prepare 
paper and textile surfaces.

Results.” 
 
Project 1: Alice. 
Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is an 1865 
novel written by English Lewis Carroll.  It tells 
the story of a girl named Alice who falls down a 
rabbit hole into a fantasy world populated by 
peculiar and anthropomorphic creatures. The tale 
plays with logic in ways that have given the story 
lasting popularity.  This installation plays literally 
with the concept of a ‘moment’ frozen in time by 
moulding its fabric components out of concrete.  
The famous ‘tea party’ scene from the story, told 
through minimal elements, is brought to life via 
additional audio effects; thus what we don’t 
actually see, we can hear.

Project 4: Polluted Beauty. 
Based on the concept of applying Photocatalytic 
cement, which absorbs air pollutants, to the walls 
of this chamber, the space gradually becomes 
increasingly ‘dirty and dusty’ to reveal a ‘hidden’ 
kind of polluted beauty.  Words, which we 
discover are actually the lines of a poem, ask us 
the question: Will we ever learn?  Ironically, due 
to frequently poor air level quality, the more dirty 
the air, the more we begin to see the ’beauty’.

Project 5: Moon City. 
Man’s obsession to possess and conquer is 
prevalent in all cultures.  We aim to harness 
power from the elements, to yield minerals and 
resources from the earth…so why not colonise 
the moon?  This installation draws visual 
inspiration from Fritz Lang’s epic film 
Metropolis, to present a vision of the future 
where the ‘concrete jungle’ communities we live 
in on Earth have been faithfully reproduced many 
million miles away.  Making a statement 
regarding man’s destructive drive to ‘own’ 
everything, Moon City reminds us of our folly in 
not learning from our mistakes.

4.1.3 “Tangible 
Interfaces Workshop 
2010: Conclusion.” 
 
Through learning we re-create ourselves. 
Through learning we re-perceive the world and 
our relationship to it.  Through learning, we 
extend our capacity to create, to be part of an on-
going, self-design process.   The purpose of the 
Tangible Interfaces Workshop was to challenge 
the boundaries that exist between traditional 
applications of materials, time-honoured 
handcraft techniques and technology.  Each one-
of-a-kind project is the result of the conversation 
between ‘maker’ and ‘object’ and expresses the 
‘preciousness’ and ‘potential’ of materials.   
 
The project value for MVC student participants 
lay in the discovery of the commonalities in their 
design processes, as well as in sharing their own 
specific knowledge; and in this context, answers 
to one problem often lead to more questions and 
potentially high degrees of uncertainty, which 
meant that students needed to be flexible and 
open-minded.  This workshop highlighted that 
those involved in artistic and creative practices 
need to have confidence in their skills and 
knowledge base to collaborate with people 
outside their discipline.  The traditional 
boundaries between art, architecture, graphic, 
and product design are dissolving in critically 
significant ways.  The practice of creating ‘art’ 
and ‘design’ is evolving into a de-centred and 
expanding world of individuals (designers) 
concerned with collectivity, collaboration and 
direct engagement with social constituencies and 
the design community has an inherent 
responsibility built into its remit to engage such 
constituencies.   
 
In conclusion, through the artistic 
transformation of everyday objects and materials 
into aesthetically pleasing artefacts, Tangible 
Interfaces Workshop participants combined 
information gleaned from all influences and 
stages of activity to promote results that 
challenged pre-conceived notions about materials 
and their conventional applications.  Student 
‘thinking’ was moved outward into a variety of 
perspectives; to use content as a vehicle to 
prompt diverse or unique thinking. 
 
4.2 “Tangible 
Interfaces: An 
Investigation Of How 
To Embed Sentiment 
Into Materials: Design 
Results.” 
 
Lost & Found™ (From Analogue To Digital, And 
Back Again) is a design philosophy that has 
evolved from research conducted into the 
investigation of how to embed sentiment into 
materials.  This philosophy abstracts the language 
of nature and springs from the marriage between 
the digital and analogue worlds; where the 
‘dualism’ between the two is challenged, to 
communicate ethereal expression and emotional 
content.  The three designs created have an 
emphasis on materials, technology and processes, 
and illustrate how the Lost & Found™ visual 
language may be applied to create artefacts with 
unique qualities. 
 
4.2.1 “Venus Bowl.”  
 
Change is inevitable.  In exploring the boundaries 
between technology and materials, it’s not crucial 
for designers to use computational engineering; 
however a generation of digitally enabled creators 
now fluctuates between the analogue and the 
digital, from concept to realisation.  In a 
conversation between traditional handcraft

Invisible Window. 
Multi-media installation. 
 
Laser cut and laser engraved transparent sheet acrylic 
treated with Cyanoacrylate (a fast-acting adhesive) to 
create an authentic-looking aged and weathered 
wooden window; which when presented in conjunction 
with a projected light source creates the (invisible) 
illusion of a ‘real’ window. Shadow play is an ancient 
form of storytelling where articulation in front of an 
illuminated backdrop creates an illusion.  In the same 
way, Invisible Window invites individuals to interact 
with its projected image to engage in a visual (and 
playful) ‘dialogue’. 
 
4.2.3 “Embroidered 
Furniture.” 
 
Working at the boundaries of craft and design, 
Embroidered Furniture applies artisanal 
techniques to create a unique concept that 
imbues abandoned objects with a magic that 
transcends their original function.  ‘Forsaken’ or 
‘deserted’ defines the word abandoned and many 
objects can be described as thus; however a new 
paradigm, has emerged, which challenges the 
traditional boundaries between old and new, 
digital and analogue, which can be described as 
‘the meeting of objects and materials in a story of 
responsive exchange.’ 
 
Intertwined with the language of the workshop 
and playing with traditional practices, to form an 
aesthetic coupling between (abandoned) objects 
and craft, Embroidered Furniture artfully 
reconfigures seemingly insignificant items to 
form a synthesised whole; and in the process, 
create a new and unexpected meaning.   A 
celebration of ‘use’ and ‘re-use’, light and shadow 
and tactile experience (Version 1), this concept 
makes clear its concern about the waste of 
resources; and through using abandoned objects 
to explore provocative issues such as our 
relationship to discarded objects, transforms the 
practice of handcraft into a rich medium of social 
investigation. 
 
The ‘poetry’ of artefacts was highlighted by 
Duchamp’s radical gesture of transforming the 
manufactured everyday object into a work of art, 
thus Embroidered Furniture explores the margins 
between object and materials in an experimental 
and highly aestheticised way, applying results that 
have emerged out of probing materiality. 
 
 
 32 
Design, resulted in the creation of MothEaten™ 
Lights which combine traditional handcraft 
techniques with advanced lighting technology to 
create a contemporary artefact.  Similarly, this 
work has embraced Bio-inspiration, and delved 
into nature’s tactile and narrative layers to create 
new forms of experience and perception that 
invite reflection and contemplation. 
 
In conclusion, to date, metaphors have been the 
most noticeable way of describing how empathy 
can be ‘achieved’ in design creations.  Battarbee et 
al. (2002) describe it as ‘leaving the design office 
and becoming immersed in the lives, 
environments, attitudes, experiences and dreams 
of the future users and ‘internalizing the 
requirements of the users’. [33]  However, this 
research has found that in order to create designs 
using materials that embed sentiment, 
interaction with people on a ‘human’ level is 
required to evoke a sense of curiosity as well as 
expectation.  The three pieces created all 
enhance presence in environments, both tangibly 
and visibly and this project believes ‘have’ and 
‘will’ touch the soul.
