6.1 Design Goal 
The most significant drawback of suspended bicycles is their tendency to dissipate pedaling energy 
through the spring and shock absorber. As the rider imparts force into the pedals the vertical vector 
component causes the bicycle to bob on its suspension. This undesirable suspension movement 
dissipates a significant pe
overall motive efficiency. 
This research proposes an innovative self-tuning damper of a suspension fork for bicycles. The 
fundamental idea of the self-tuning mechanism is to set up an orifice with a variable sectional area 
in the fluid passages inside the damper. This damper automatically tunes the damping coefficient by 
altering the oil flow rate through the passages according to the input force or velocity. It would 
therefore be advantageous to automatically lock out the suspension system when required, 
specifically during uphill riding and rapid acceleration when the rider is pedaling hard. This 
mechanism automatically releases the l
downhill operation over bumpy terrain. 
6.2 Apparatus Configuration and Operations 
Fig. 4 sketches out the overall configuration of the proposed design, comprising of the key 
components in a damper side of a twin-tube bicycle front fork. The upper fork is slidely connected 
within the lower fork. The damping stator is fixed at the upper end of the inner tube. The lower end 
of the inner tube is immobilized with the lower end of the upper fork. The main piston, 
synchronally moving with the lower fork, impels and draws the oil in the lower chamber. The fluid, 
passing through the orifices inside the damping stator, flows back and forth between the upper and 
lower chambers.

8.2 Results 
The simulation result is shown in Fig. 10. Various quantities are normalized and combined in the 
same plot for the convenience of comparison. Refer to subplot (a), “fm” indicates the sinusoidal 
driving force to impel the main piston, having the maximum value 788.22N. The main piston starts 
to oscillate with the input force after a 0.05s delay, caused by the throttling effect of the spool 
valves. The maximum value of the main piston displacement is 65.65e-3 m. The separation film 
coincides with main piston’s normalized oscillation approximately with a displacement of 42.83e-3 
m. 
The force(Fm) to main piston displacement(D)/velocity(V) plot is given in subplot (b). The Fm-D 
curve can be ignored since the proposed mechanical design is a velocity-sensitive fluid structure 
and irrelevant to the piston displacement. The maximal absolute value of force occurs when 
displacement is zero, since the piston reaches its maximal velocity when it passes the neutral 
position. The top-right corner of the Fm-V curve represents this phenonemon, saying the maximum 
velocity is 1.15m/s. The damper shows a rigid-style fork when the normalized velocity is about 0.1, 
while it shifts to a soft-style suspension when velocity is about 0.2-0.5. This curve is more 
preferable for riders because it reveals a lower speed damping for a good yet firm controlled feeling, 
and less high-speed damping for a more comfortable ride on square-edged bumps.

Abstract – Bicycle configuration is not as large as those of motorcycles or automobiles, while it indeed composes a 
complicated dynamic system. People’s requirements on comfortability, controllability and safety grow higher as the 
research and development technologies improve. The shock absorber affects the vehicle suspension performances 
enormously. The absorber takes the vibration energy and releases it at a suitable time, keeping the wheel under a proper 
contact condition with road surface, maintaining the vehicle chassis stability. Suspension design for mountain bicycles 
is more difficult than that of city bikes since it encounters dynamic variations on road and loading conditions. Riders 
need a stiff damper as they exert to tread on the pedals when climbing, while a soft damper when they descend downhill. 
Various switchable shock absorbers are proposed in markets, however riders have to manually switch them among soft, 
hard and lock positions. This study proposes a novel design of the bicycle shock absorber, which provides automatic 
smooth tuning of the damping coefficient, from a predetermined lower bound to theoretically unlimited. An automatic 
quick releasing valve is involved in this design so that it can release the peak pressure when the suspension fork runs 
into a square-wave type obstacle and prevent the chassis from damage, avoiding the rider skeleton from injury. This 
design achieves the automatic tuning process by innovative plunger valve and fluidic passage arrangements without any 
electronic devices. Theoretical modelling of the damper and spring are established in this study. Design parameters of 
the valves and fluidic passages are determined. Relations between design parameters and shock abs

12. Introduction 
2.1 Background 
Compared with automobiles and motorcycles, bicycles construct a smaller structure yet complicated system with 
more than 2000 components. These components can be divided into several subsystems, including the frame, 
transmission, wheel, steering, brake and accessory subsystems. The front suspension fork and rear shock absorber, such 
as the apparatuses sh

A feasible suspension system holds the following capabilities: 
The fluidic circuit inside the shock damper has to involve a sensory mechanism to determine the system position, 
velocity or acceleration, thus the semi-active system can adjust its parameters by certain means. There are at least three 
types of means that can alter the damping coefficient: 
1. Structural friction force. This type employs an electromagnetic motor or other mechanical energy 
output device to control the normal force between contact components, altering the friction force 
therefore varying the vibration energy dissipation. 
2. Fluid viscosity in the damper. These dampers fill at least part of the cylinder chambers with 
electro- or magneto-rheological fluid. The fluid viscosity is changed as the electric or magnetic 
field varies, altering the resistant force of the damper. 
3. Orifice area control. The orifice area controls the flow rate among passages and chambers, 
changing the damping force of the shock absorber. 
Due to the limited space, power supply deficiency and weight requirement, a great part of damper designs of the 
bicycle shock absorbers focuses on the orifice area control. 
12.3 Related Works 
Considering the fluid dynamics, Mollica and Youcef-Toumi proposed a physical model for a high pressure monotube 
shock absorber to analyze the nonlinear dynamic behavior of these dampers [5]. Results explained that the hysteresis 
frequency dependency is produced by the interaction at higher frequencies that results in added phase loss due to the 
capacitive elements. Goncalves evaluated the dynamic response of different semi-active control policies over a 
magneto-rheological damper as tested on a single suspension quarter-car system [6]. Bathe et al. presented advances in 
capabilities for the analysis of fluid flows with structural interactions [8]. An arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation 
is used to solve for the fluid response with structural interface and free surface conditions. Beghi et al. involved a 
grey-box modeling technique to describe the complex behavior of motorcycle shock absorbers, exhibiting a significant 
improvement in the force prediction capability over traditional linear models [22]. Yang et al. designed a new shock 
absorber with Coulomb–fluid damping through coupling oil, wire gauze, rubber and spring for reinforcement of 
electronic-information equipment in vibration and impact [23]. The nonlinear dynamic model for attenuating vibration 
mode is derived from coupling physical mechanism of fluid and Coulomb friction. 
In the field of vehicle system dynamics, Wang and Hull proposed a model for determining rider induced energy 
losses in bicycle suspension systems [24]. Ignoring the terrain irregularities, the power dissipated by the stiffness and 
dissipative characteristics of the suspension elements was calculated. Pracny et al. performed a dynamic full vehicle 
simulation using a thermo-mechanically coupled hybrid neural network shock absorber model [25]. In this shock 
absorber model, the spline approach is combined with a temperature-dependent neural network, simulated on a test rig 
in ADAMS-Car multi-body simulation software with a displacement-controlled excitation. 
As there is currently no infrastructure available to test the shock absorbers’ performance, Heritier built a test rig 
allowing the performance characteristics of the various damper settings to be explored and vehicle performance to be 
optimized [26]. Titlestad et al. built a test rig, simulating regular impacts of the rear wheel with bumps in a rolling road, 
measuring physiological variables of oxygen consumption and heart rate, together with speeds and forces at various 
points in that system.  
13. The Proposed Design 
e:\home\work\work2\me\damper\report\090708_nsc_結案報告\出國報告_091030a.doc 16/24 
13.1 Design Goal 
A significant defect of suspended bicycles is the tendency to dissipate pedaling energy through the spring and shock 
absorber. As the rider imparts force into the pedals the vertical vector component causes the bicycle to bob on its 
suspension. This undesirable suspension movement dissipates a significant percentage of the imparted pedaling energy 
and can reduce the bicycle's overall motive efficiency. 
A widely adopted solution to this problem is to introduce a “lockout” means for riders to manually operate when 
desired. The term lockout refers to one or more of the following elements in combination: mechanically limiting the 
amount of suspension travel; increasing the damping response of the shock absorber, most importantly in compression; 
increasing the force-displacement rate of the suspension; increasing the spring preload of the suspension. Normally the 
rider would engage the lockout during heavy pedaling as required by hill climbing or acceleration but could disengage it 
for coasting and downhill operation over bumpy terrain. The most common form of bicycle suspension lockout consists 
of a valve that limits the flow of oil past the shock absorber's main piston. The limitation of the manually activated 
suspension lockout is that it requires the constant attention of a rider already busy with numerous other tractive and 
control functions. 
This research proposes an innovative self-tuning damper with quick releasing (QR) valve of a suspension fork for 
bicycles. The fundamental idea of the self-tuning mechanism is to set up an orifice with a variable sectional area in the

15. Simulation and Discussion 
15.1 Conditions 
The dimensions and masses involved in this simulation are evaluated from the CAD system. The complete parameter 
list is collected in Table 2. The Runge-Kutta method is employed to solve these ODEs [32]. Sampling time during the 
simulation is 3.7037e-4s, attentively tracking the dynamics with 720 data points per round in the 225rpm cycles. 
Deformation of structures and frictional forces between the pistons and cylinders are not considered in this model.  
15.2 Results 
The simulation result is shown in Fig. 10. Various quantities are normalized and combined in the same plot for the 
convenience of comparison. 
Refer to subplot (a), “Fm” indicates the sinusoidal driving force to impel the main piston, having the maximum value 
788.22N. The main piston starts to oscillate with the input force after a 0.05s delay, caused by the throttling effect of the 
spool valves. The maximum value of the main piston displacement is 66.41e-3 m. The separation film coincides with 
main piston’s normalized oscillation approximately with a displacement of 43.32e-3 m.

The proposed design can reduce the cost by eliminating the lockout-related components. Furthermore, it can improve 
the rider convenience and safety since the frequently operations are omitted. This design consumes no electric power to 
operate, feasible to be equipped on low-powered or powerless vehicles such as bicycles.  
Further works cover (1) composing a more comprehensive system model for the cavitation occurring during heavy 
load and rapid piston movements; (2) forming a computational fluidic dynamic analysis model to virtually confirm the 
proposed theoretical model; and (3) constructing a damper prototype and a dynamic test rig to experimentally verify the 
mathematical model.

6.1 Design Goal 
The most significant drawback of suspended bicycles is their tendency to dissipate pedaling energy 
through the spring and shock absorber. As the rider imparts force into the pedals the vertical vector 
component causes the bicycle to bob on its suspension. This undesirable suspension movement 
dissipates a significant pe
overall motive efficiency. 
This research proposes an innovative self-tuning damper of a suspension fork for bicycles. The 
fundamental idea of the self-tuning mechanism is to set up an orifice with a variable sectional area 
in the fluid passages inside the damper. This damper automatically tunes the damping coefficient by 
altering the oil flow rate through the passages according to the input force or velocity. It would 
therefore be advantageous to automatically lock out the suspension system when required, 
specifically during uphill riding and rapid acceleration when the rider is pedaling hard. This 
mechanism automatically releases the l
downhill operation over bumpy terrain. 
6.2 Apparatus Configuration and Operations 
Fig. 4 sketches out the overall configuration of the proposed design, comprising of the key 
components in a damper side of a twin-tube bicycle front fork. The upper fork is slidely connected 
within the lower fork. The damping stator is fixed at the upper end of the inner tube. The lower end 
of the inner tube is immobilized with the lower end of the upper fork. The main piston, 
synchronally moving with the lower fork, impels and draws the oil in the lower chamber. The fluid, 
passing through the orifices inside the damping stator, flows back and forth between the upper and 
lower chambers.

8.2 Results 
The simulation result is shown in Fig. 10. Various quantities are normalized and combined in the 
same plot for the convenience of comparison. Refer to subplot (a), “fm” indicates the sinusoidal 
driving force to impel the main piston, having the maximum value 788.22N. The main piston starts 
to oscillate with the input force after a 0.05s delay, caused by the throttling effect of the spool 
valves. The maximum value of the main piston displacement is 65.65e-3 m. The separation film 
coincides with main piston’s normalized oscillation approximately with a displacement of 42.83e-3 
m. 
The force(Fm) to main piston displacement(D)/velocity(V) plot is given in subplot (b). The Fm-D 
curve can be ignored since the proposed mechanical design is a velocity-sensitive fluid structure 
and irrelevant to the piston displacement. The maximal absolute value of force occurs when 
displacement is zero, since the piston reaches its maximal velocity when it passes the neutral 
position. The top-right corner of the Fm-V curve represents this phenonemon, saying the maximum 
velocity is 1.15m/s. The damper shows a rigid-style fork when the normalized velocity is about 0.1, 
while it shifts to a soft-style suspension when velocity is about 0.2-0.5. This curve is more 
preferable for riders because it reveals a lower speed damping for a good yet firm controlled feeling, 
and less high-speed damping for a more comfortable ride on square-edged bumps.

Abstract – Bicycle configuration is not as large as those of motorcycles or automobiles, while it indeed composes a 
complicated dynamic system. People’s requirements on comfortability, controllability and safety grow higher as the 
research and development technologies improve. The shock absorber affects the vehicle suspension performances 
enormously. The absorber takes the vibration energy and releases it at a suitable time, keeping the wheel under a proper 
contact condition with road surface, maintaining the vehicle chassis stability. Suspension design for mountain bicycles 
is more difficult than that of city bikes since it encounters dynamic variations on road and loading conditions. Riders 
need a stiff damper as they exert to tread on the pedals when climbing, while a soft damper when they descend downhill. 
Various switchable shock absorbers are proposed in markets, however riders have to manually switch them among soft, 
hard and lock positions. This study proposes a novel design of the bicycle shock absorber, which provides automatic 
smooth tuning of the damping coefficient, from a predetermined lower bound to theoretically unlimited. An automatic 
quick releasing valve is involved in this design so that it can release the peak pressure when the suspension fork runs 
into a square-wave type obstacle and prevent the chassis from damage, avoiding the rider skeleton from injury. This 
design achieves the automatic tuning process by innovative plunger valve and fluidic passage arrangements without any 
electronic devices. Theoretical modelling of the damper and spring are established in this study. Design parameters of 
the valves and fluidic passages are determined. Relations between design parameters and shock abs

12. Introduction 
2.1 Background 
Compared with automobiles and motorcycles, bicycles construct a smaller structure yet complicated system with 
more than 2000 components. These components can be divided into several subsystems, including the frame, 
transmission, wheel, steering, brake and accessory subsystems. The front suspension fork and rear shock absorber, such

A feasible suspension system holds the following capabilities: 
The fluidic circuit inside the shock damper has to involve a sensory mechanism to determine the system position, 
velocity or acceleration, thus the semi-active system can adjust its parameters by certain means. There are at least three 
types of means that can alter the damping coefficient: 
1. Structural friction force. This type employs an electromagnetic motor or other mechanical energy 
output device to control the normal force between contact components, altering the friction force 
therefore varying the vibration energy dissipation. 
2. Fluid viscosity in the damper. These dampers fill at least part of the cylinder chambers with 
electro- or magneto-rheological fluid. The fluid viscosity is changed as the electric or magnetic 
field varies, altering the resistant force of the damper. 
3. Orifice area control. The orifice area controls the flow rate among passages and chambers, 
changing the damping force of the shock absorber. 
Due to the limited space, power supply deficiency and weight requirement, a great part of damper designs of the 
bicycle shock absorbers focuses on the orifice area control. 
12.3 Related Works 
Considering the fluid dynamics, Mollica and Youcef-Toumi proposed a physical model for a high pressure monotube 
shock absorber to analyze the nonlinear dynamic behavior of these dampers [5]. Results explained that the hysteresis 
frequency dependency is produced by the interaction at higher frequencies that results in added phase loss due to the 
capacitive elements. Goncalves evaluated the dynamic response of different semi-active control policies over a 
magneto-rheological damper as tested on a single suspension quarter-car system [6]. Bathe et al. presented advances in 
capabilities for the analysis of fluid flows with structural interactions [8]. An arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation 
is used to solve for the fluid response with structural interface and free surface conditions. Beghi et al. involved a 
grey-box modeling technique to describe the complex behavior of motorcycle shock absorbers, exhibiting a significant 
improvement in the force prediction capability over traditional linear models [22]. Yang et al. designed a new shock 
absorber with Coulomb–fluid damping through coupling oil, wire gauze, rubber and spring for reinforcement of 
electronic-information equipment in vibration and impact [23]. The nonlinear dynamic model for attenuating vibration 
mode is derived from coupling physical mechanism of fluid and Coulomb friction. 
In the field of vehicle system dynamics, Wang and Hull proposed a model for determining rider induced energy 
losses in bicycle suspension systems [24]. Ignoring the terrain irregularities, the power dissipated by the stiffness and 
dissipative characteristics of the suspension elements was calculated. Pracny et al. performed a dynamic full vehicle 
simulation using a thermo-mechanically coupled hybrid neural network shock absorber model [25]. In this shock 
absorber model, the spline approach is combined with a temperature-dependent neural network, simulated on a test rig 
in ADAMS-Car multi-body simulation software with a displacement-controlled excitation. 
As there is currently no infrastructure available to test the shock absorbers’ performance, Heritier built a test rig 
allowing the performance characteristics of the various damper settings to be explored and vehicle performance to be 
optimized [26]. Titlestad et al. built a test rig, simulating regular impacts of the rear wheel with bumps in a rolling road, 
measuring physiological variables of oxygen consumption and heart rate, together with speeds and forces at various 
points in that system.  
13. The Proposed Design 
e:\home\work\work2\me\damper\report\090708_nsc_結案報告\出國報告_091030a.doc 16/24 
13.1 Design Goal 
A significant defect of suspended bicycles is the tendency to dissipate pedaling energy through the spring and shock 
absorber. As the rider imparts force into the pedals the vertical vector component causes the bicycle to bob on its 
suspension. This undesirable suspension movement dissipates a significant percentage of the imparted pedaling energy 
and can reduce the bicycle's overall motive efficiency. 
A widely adopted solution to this problem is to introduce a “lockout” means for riders to manually operate when 
desired. The term lockout refers to one or more of the following elements in combination: mechanically limiting the 
amount of suspension travel; increasing the damping response of the shock absorber, most importantly in compression; 
increasing the force-displacement rate of the suspension; increasing the spring preload of the suspension. Normally the 
rider would engage the lockout during heavy pedaling as required by hill climbing or acceleration but could disengage it 
for coasting and downhill operation over bumpy terrain. The most common form of bicycle suspension lockout consists 
of a valve that limits the flow of oil past the shock absorber's main piston. The limitation of the manually activated 
suspension lockout is that it requires the constant attention of a rider already busy with numerous other tractive and 
control functions. 
This research proposes an innovative self-tuning damper with quick releasing (QR) valve of a suspension fork for 
bicycles. The fundamental idea of the self-tuning mechanism is to set up an orifice with a variable sectional area in the

15. Simulation and Discussion 
15.1 Conditions 
The dimensions and masses involved in this simulation are evaluated from the CAD system. The complete parameter 
list is collected in Table 2. The Runge-Kutta method is employed to solve these ODEs [32]. Sampling time during the 
simulation is 3.7037e-4s, attentively tracking the dynamics with 720 data points per round in the 225rpm cycles. 
Deformation of structures and frictional forces between the pistons and cylinders are not considered in this model.  
15.2 Results 
The simulation result is shown in Fig. 10. Various quantities are normalized and combined in the same plot for the 
convenience of comparison. 
Refer to subplot (a), “Fm” indicates the sinusoidal driving force to impel the main piston, having the maximum value 
788.22N. The main piston starts to oscillate with the input force after a 0.05s delay, caused by the throttling effect of the 
spool valves. The maximum value of the main piston displacement is 66.41e-3 m. The separation film coincides with 
main piston’s normalized oscillation approximately with a displacement of 43.32e-3 m.

the rider convenience and safety since the frequently operations are omitted. This design consumes no electric power to 
operate, feasible to be equipped on low-powered or powerless vehicles such as bicycles.  
Further works cover (1) composing a more comprehensive system model for the cavitation occurring during heavy 
load and rapid piston movements; (2) forming a computational fluidic dynamic analysis model to virtually confirm the 
proposed theoretical model; and (3) constructing a damper prototype and a dynamic test rig to experimentally verify the 
mathematical model.
