Abstract 
Recent advances in sensor and communication technologies have prompted the rapid 
development of telemedicine/telecare and home telehealth systems. The remote monitoring 
techniques have also extended to the home environments for non-obtrusively collecting 
health-related parameters of home users. This research project aims to develop a home telehealth 
system which uses remote monitoring technique and data transmission via wireless 
communication and wireless sensor network (WSN). The distributed data server (DDS) was 
developed as a base station which features data logging, and data retrieval via the Internet. In 
addition, several activity monitors coupled with wireless communication capability were 
connected to the DDS. The continuous whole integrated system was demonstrated to provide the 
quantitative information of the home users’ activity and functional health status. The potential 
development and application were also discussed.

1. Introduction 
According to the UN’s definition, a society in which more than 7 percent of the total 
population is aged 65 or over is referred to as an aging society. Taiwan has become an aging 
society since 1993. Currently in 2005 the population aged 65 or older is over 2 million (9.74%). 
The needs of health care and management for the elderly has become an important issue. The 
increasing needs for elderly care cannot be solved by merely increasing the number of 
care-givers.  
The home has become the centerpiece of health delivery systems today. Tele-homecare can 
be defined as the use of information and communication technologies to enable effective delivery 
and management of health services at a patient’s residence [Office of Health and Information 
Highway, Canada, 1998]. Tele-homecare differs from tele-medicine in the sense that people who 
transmit and receive medical information are not necessarily medical doctors but the patients 
themselves and their families, nurses, care-givers, home-helpers and medical technical experts 
[Tsuji, 2002]. Koch [2006] gave an overview about the current state and future trends in research 
on home telehealth in an international perspective. 
The Portable Tele-homecare Monitoring System (PTMS) has currently been under 
development by the Gerontechnology Research Center, at Yuan Ze University. Instead of using a 
centralized database structure that gathers data from many households, in PTMS a household is 
the fundamental unit for data transmission, storage, and analysis. Equipped with different sensors, 
PTMS can be used for long-term personal health data management of the elderly in a home 
environment. PTMS also provides care-givers with convenient access to the health data of the 
elderly, and real time event-driven messages in urgent situations. Several PTMS applications are 
demonstrated, including environment and daily behavior monitoring, an RFID-based entrance 
guard system, sleep quality monitoring, vital sign monitoring, and a tele-presence robot. 
 
The purpose of this research is to develop a activity monitoring system which integrates 
wearable activity monitors and a series of in-home activity monitors. A tri-axial accelerometer is 
used for motion detection of body movement. A dedicated body movement algorithm embedded 
in the microcontrollers is developed to actively recognize human still postures (sitting, standing 
and  lying), posture transitions (sit-stand type or lie-sit type), locomotion (walking) and 
locations in space in a home environment. The tri-axial accelerometer and the microcontroller are 
integrated with a wireless communication module to form a wearable activity monitor (WAM), 
which transmits the signals of body movements to the distributed data server (DDS), which is the 
core of the PTMS. 
The DDS wirelessly receives the identified signals of body movements from the WAM and 
in-home activity monitors in real time. These events are classified and then stored in the 
Multi-Media Card (MMC). Users can access the DDS using an Internet browser or a dedicated 
VB program to retrieve historical data and perform data management. Quantitative assessments

(2) Built-in RTL8019AS Ethernet controller 
In PIC_SERVER v2, the Network Interface Controller (NIC) using a RTL8019AS 
Ethernet controller is an external module. In PIC_SERVER v3, this Ethernet controller along 
with an EEPROM chip is integrated together onto the same PCB. The memory capacity of 
the EEPROM is enhanced from 256kB to 512kB or 1MB. 
(3) PCB miniaturization 
Most of the parts of PIC_SERVER v3 are in SMD packages. With less vias needed in 
the PCB and reduced size of each part, the layout density (part placement and track routing) 
can be increased, which effectively reduces the size of the PCB. 
Figure 2.1 to Figure 2.4 shows the schematics of a PIC_SERVER v3. Table 3.2 is the 
BOM list of PIC_ SERVER v3. Two RJ45 connectors (P02-102-11A9 and P65-P01-11A9, 
SpeedTech) can be used in this model. The later one is preferable for the built-in LED (TX 
and RX status) indicators.

The PCB size of PIC_SERVER v3 is 40mm×80mm. Figure 2.5 shows the part placement, 
and Figure 2.6 shows the track routing. All parts are on the top layer except the RJ45 connector. 
Tracks linking up the bypass capacitors are as short as possible for a better noise shunting effect. 
The track lengths of the A/D channels are also as short as possible and are separated from the area 
of digital I/O channels to avoid noise contamination. Track vias, especially those near the SMD 
pads, are covered with solder masks to avoid short-circuits. Figure 2.7 shows the finished product 
of PIC_ SERVER v3 of which overall size is 40mm×85mm×15mm.

 2.2 Design of the peripheral application board 
PIC_SERVER v3 is a controller module with Internet capability. With only external power 
supplied, it can operate as a web server. The purpose of the peripheral application board is to 
provide an expanded platform for PIC_SERVER v3 for data acquisition, processing and storage. 
Combining the PIC_SERVER v3 and the PAB, the DDS is the core component in the PTMS 
structure.  
Figure 3.8 to Figure 2.1~2.3 are schematics of all the circuit sections in a PAB. Table 2.3 is 
the BOM list. For the power section shown in Figure 2.8, three low dropout voltage regulators 
LM2940/LM3940 are used instead of the LM78XX series for lower heat generation. Two 
LM2940 voltage regulators generate stable +5V DC power output from 6.25V up to 26V DC 
input. One is for main ICs and the other for LCD backlight. 3.3V power from a LM3940 voltage 
regulator is for MMC. In addition, unregulated input bypass power, regulated +5V and +3.3V 
power are also available from the SIP pocket CN4 (J6) power bank (Figure 3.9). D2 and D3 
LEDs are indicators of power and RJ45 link status, respectively. If the net cable (CAT5) is 
disconnected, the D3 indicator will go out. 
Figure 2.9 shows the connector. CN5 (J7) is the main 19-port I/O bank with up to 8 analog 
A/D input channels and 3 CCP ports. JP2 and JP3 are I2C ports and JP4 is for LCD text panels or 
an external keyboard (digital input). J6 (CN4) and J8 (CN6) are a power bank and a GND bank,

3. Design of the wireless activity monitors 
3.1 Wearable activity monitor 
The wearable activity monitor (WAM) has three major functions: Data acquisition, data 
calculation and wireless data transmission. This device collects accelerations produced by human 
physical motions and simultaneously identifies possible posture or postural transition with 
embedded algorithms. Identified events are then wirelessly transmitted to a receiver module 
installed in local DDS.  
3.1.1 Schematic design 
The physical configuration of the WAM should be small in package while providing 
sufficient abilities in calculation and memory. Figure 3.1 shows the functional framework of the 
WAM. Detailed schematics are shown in Figure 3.2 to Figure 3.5.  
Due to the fact that the signal level and precision of A/D conversion in the PIC 
microcontroller as well as the Voff level of the accelerometer output both change with the Vdd 
voltage. Therefore, it is imperative to provide a stable and constant voltage (Vdd) supply by using 
power regulation for precise signal calculation. A voltage regulator (LM3940) which accepts DC 
+4.5V to +9V input power from batteries provides the PIC microcontroller and the accelerometer 
with regulated and stable DC +3.3V power supply.

Figure 3.2 Schematic of the wearable DAU (microcontroller) 
A remote control encoder (PT2262, Princeton Technology) and a transmitter module 
(TWS-CS-2, Wenshing Electronics Co., LTD) are used for wireless data transmission. PT2262 
encodes data and address pins into a serial coded waveform suitable for RF and IR modulation. 
TWS-CS-2 is a wireless RF transmitter through 433.92MHz frequency band. If any posture status 
or transition is recognized after calculation in the stage of the microcontroller, a serial code which 
includes the address ID of the source and the data to be delivered is generated by the 
microcontroller. 
Figure 3.3 shows the schematic of the RF transmission device. Six pins (D0 to D5) of 
PT2262 which connect to digital RB ports of PIC18F6722 are assigned for 6-bit serial code, 
which includes 4 bits for data and the remaining 2 bits for address. By adjusting the output level 
of the RBx pins, there are up to 64 codes available for data and address encoding. The RB7 pin is 
for transmission enabling. If the level of RB7 is low (pulled down to GND), the PT2262 will 
encode the data and address according to each Dx status. The encoded signal is sent to the

3.1.2 PCB layout and physical package 
Figure 3.6 shows the physical package of the WAM. The size of WAM is 
100mm×60mm×25mm (excluding the battery cartridge), and 140g in total weight. Figure 3.7 
shows part layout on the PCB. The antenna is hidden inside the case. A beeper can be optionally 
connected to the board for self-test or calibration. As shown in Figure 3.8, the WAM is designed 
to be attached to the front-right side at waist by clipping or mounting onto the belt of pants or 
skirt. The case in black is a battery cartridge with 3×AAA alkaline batteries which provides 4.5V 
power for the WAM. The WAM accepts power voltage from 3.5V to up 6V. Power voltage less 
than 3.5V will cause the voltage regulator to shutdown. Moreover, data transmission must be in 
the same frequency band. Figure 4.9 shows the relation between oscillation frequency and 
voltage for the decoder (PT2262) and encoder (PT2272). For both the encoder in the transmitter 
module and the decoder in the receiver module, the oscillating frequency (OSC) increases with 
increasing power voltage. Due to the fact that the receiver module uses 5V power from the DDS 
which corresponds to about 8 kHz oscillating frequency, the power for WAM should be within 
6V for correct data delivering.  
 23
 
Figure 3.9 OSC frequencies vs. voltages for encoder (PT2262) and decoder (PT2272) 
 3.2 Receiver module for DDS 
The receiver module is a DDS-based device that receives real-time data transmitted from the 
transmitter in the WAM. This module can be connected to the DDS through sockets CN4, CN5 
andCN6. Figure 3.10 shows the schematic design of the receiver module which primarily consists 
of two parts: Decoder and receiver. The decoder (PT2272, Princeton Tech. Corp.) pairs with the 
encoder PT2262 for RF wireless transmission. It decodes data obtained from the receiver 
(RWS-530-1, Wenshing Electronics Co., Ltd.) to binary series (address + data) identical to what is 
encoded in the PT2262 encoder. In this design, 6 data pins (D0 to D5) are used for data 
registration, and 6 LEDs are used to indicate the state of each data pin (on: 1, off: 0). The VT pin 
of the decoder is a decoding indicator. The pin assignment of data pins (D0 to D5) and the VT pin 
coupled to DDS are in the order: B6, B7, B2, B1, B4, G0 and B5. Data decoding is completed 
when the VT pin is pulled up at high state level, the DDS retrieves the data by reading the states 
of D0 to D5 of the decoder. On the contrary, the DDS will not read the states of the pins when the 
VT pin is pulled down to GND, which means that there is no data received by the receiver.   
Figure 3.11 shows the lab prototype of the receiver module, and Figure 3.12 shows the 
receiver module installed on the DDS.

3.2 Design of home activity monitors 
Non-invasive and non-obtrusive (unconscious) activity monitoring at home is important. 
The intervention of such monitoring must not disturb one’s normal activities in free-living 
environment. Several fundamental activities at home are the activities in local area (e.g., the 
kitchen, bathroom), the use of home facilities (TV set, light, bed), and event the medicine intake. 
Therefore, the home activity monitors were designed to acquire those three fundamental items of 
activities at home.   
(1) Magnetic switches 
The magnetic switches which operate when been activated by external magnetic fields are 
highly suitable for detecting the opening or closing of doors and windows because external power 
supply is not necessary. Such a on/off type sensor can be easily connected with the wireless

(3) Light detection (luminance) 
The detection of light utilizes the light dependent resisitor (LDR) of which the resistance 
varies with the external luminance. Some LDRs are shown in Figure 3.16. However, a external 
VCC power source as well as a transistor (commonly NPN-type) are used to convert the analog 
voltage (resistance) variation into a digital switch that output only the high and low levels. Figure 
3.17 illustrates the schematic for the LDR-based light detector and the senor installation.

(5) Passive infrared (PIR) 
The passive infrared sensor, different from the active (interruptive) infrared type, is a 
detector that receives the far infrared of the spectrum wavelength 4,000 to 40,000 nm emitted by 
human body. The sensor output changes with the existence and occupancy of human in a limited 
distance. An external electrical circuit must be used to amplify such subtle changes of the signal 
(usually in 10 to 20 mV). The amplified signals are directed to a relay to generate an on/off 
digital dual sate output.

The ADL home activity monitors were attempted to be installed in different sites, such as 
labs, clinical/nursing center and home environments. For example, Figure 4.2 shows the averaged 
activity intensity in the kitchen during a one-month period. It can be clearly observed that user 
had dense activities at 7 to 8 o’clock in the morning and 18 to 21 o’clock.

rotating about the X axis. This equation is a function of the three acceleration components (aX, aY 
and aZ). Consider a case, for example, where the accelerometer is moving upward (positive Z 
direction) without any rotation (tilt). Obviously, there must be no change except the Z axis 
acceleration component aZ. However, an unreasonable tilt angle will be obtained for such a case 
according to this equation.

This example explains a possible paradox probably encountered in empirical uses. In Elble’s 
report on gravitational artifact in accelerometric measurement [2005], it was stated that the 
interference of gravitational artifact cannot be solved using either bi-axial or tri-axial 
accelerometers. Therefore, the acceleration data acquired in this study cannot be used to precisely 
interpret the complex nature of human motions. In spite of this constraint, tilt sensing and 
acceleration measurement using one tri-axial accelerometer is still valid for physical activity 
because the resulting outputs still preserve apparent characteristics for either trunk tilt and 
acceleration patterns. 
(2) The wearable activity monitor 
The wearable DAU has been designed to measure human body movement. It is designed to 
be clipped onto a waist belt for minimizing discomfort and inconvenience in use. However, 
carrying the DAU might limit posture and movement when lying down and therefore further 
influences the subject’s comfort.  
As for wireless data transmission, power capacity has a significant influence on the effective 
distance and stability of data delivery. In low power status, the transmitter fails to function 
properly whereas the other parts, such as PIC microcontroller and accelerometer still function 
normally. To extend the time for use, a battery cartridge with (3×AA alkaline batteries) can be 
used instead of the AAA batteries. The antenna configuration has a great influence on the 
performance of wireless data delivery, as well. However, the antenna design has not been further 
evaluated. In the future, the onboard antenna and optimization must be taken into consideration. 
(3) Real-time identification 
The limitation in computation capability and memory capacity of the microcontroller used in 
this study, coupled with the fact that human events must be identified simultaneously to keep up 
with the next data acquisition process, limit the identification performance. Most other off-line 
systems use powerful PC-based computation software such as MATLAB to analyze the recorded 
data. Therefore, identification accuracy of those systems is usually higher than that of the 
real-time systems [Karantonis, 2006]. 
Moreover, the durations of posture transitions or movement are not the same each time, even 
for the same person. People usually perform mixed and combined movements in their normal 
activities of living. Due to the complex nature of human movement and limitations in
