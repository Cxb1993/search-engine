ABSTRACT 
 
The task to design a reliable engine protection system with highest reliability while 
considering system cost, weight and volume constraints under uncertain environments is 
very challenging. In this study, a fuzzy-based data envelopment analysis (DEA) reliability 
modeling approach is developed for designing reliable aircraft engine protection systems. 
First, a fuzzy programming problem is developed and a heuristic is constructed for 
generating a group of several most satisfactory solutions. Then, an efficiency design 
indicator is defined and DEA method is applied for completely ranking those selected 
satisfactory solutions. Results from this study suggest that the most satisfactory solution 
obtained from the fuzzy programming problem is necessarily equal to the most efficiency 
solution by the DEA method. The proposed approach can be expected to be a promising 
approach for designing reliable aircraft engine protection systems under uncertain 
environments.

1. INTRODUCION 
 
An aircraft engine protection system is a key device for preventing aircrafts from 
malfunction. How to design a reliable engine protection system with lower cost and higher 
reliability is a very challenging task. The design methodology of series-parallel systems with 
redundant can be applied to reinforce the function of aircraft engine protection systems. 
Due to the incomplete or uncertain information about the design parameters during the 
early design phase, the traditional single- or multi-objective optimization techniques may 
not be appropriate to satisfactorily solve this problem. In order to tackle this problem, fuzzy 
goal programming technique combined with data envelopment analysis might be a good 
approach to provide an efficiency solution for the aircraft engine protection system. 
 
In this study, a fuzzy-based DEA reliability modeling approach is developed for dealing with 
the design of aircraft engine protection systems. First, a fuzzy-goal programming technique 
is utilized for solving series-parallel systems with redundant-design. A heuristic method is 
devised to generate a group of most satisfactory solutions.  Secondly, a design 
performance index is defined and DEA method is applied to completely rank those 
satisfactory solutions. Finally, the proposed approach is implemented using a real-world 
data to display the benefit of this study. 
 
2. LITERATURE REVIEW 
 
The reliability problem with series-parallel multi-stages systems can be improved using 
either of the following two methods: more reliable components or redundant components at 
single parallel structure.  Kuo and Prasad [10] considered that an exact algorithm of 
reliability optimization problems was not often easy to solve, even though there was a 
solution. Park [15] utilized the fuzzy set theory to analyze two components series system of 
reliability allocation problems. Zedeh and Bellman [18] designed a fuzzy-decision 
environment to provide different kinds of total solutions for design problems. Huang [8] 
proposed a fuzzy multi-objective optimization decision method that could provide two or 
more goals of reliability optimization decisions. Recently, Nakanishi and Nakayasu [14] 
used a reliability-based design method for a structural system by formulating an expected 
total cost concept.  Levitin [11] developed an algorithm for finding optimal series-parallel 
configuration for systems consisting of units characterized by different reliability and 
solutions for the aircraft engine protection system. Two objectives and four 
constraints are considered in this study. The objectives and constraints are then 
treated as fuzzy using membership functions to quantify the uncertain parameters. 
We denote the following notations for developing a fuzzy programming model: 
 
 = fuzzy information; 
∩ = fuzzy intersection; 
iF  = the i-th fuzzy objective function; 
jG  = the j-th fuzzy constraint; 
D  = the fuzzy decision set; 
iμ  = the i-th fuzzy membership function; 
iα  = degree of satisfaction for i-th fuzzy objective; 
jα  = degree of satisfaction for j-th fuzzy constraint; 
Φ = the fuzzy set for the decision space; 
α(Φ) = the overall satisfaction; 
RS = the reliability goal; 
∇R = difference between reliability goal and lower reliability limit; 
CS = the cost goal; 
∇C = difference between cost goal and upper cost limit; 
ws = the system weight;  
vs＝the system volume. 
 
The membership function for the reliability objective denotes the degree of 
satisfaction for the reliability objective and may be given as follows. The operational 
range varies from lower reliability limit, R, to the reliability goal, RS.

following fuzzy programming problem.

The developed fuzzy programming model is one type of nonlinear problem, in which 
the fuzzy multi-objective programming problem is converted into a deterministic 
single objective problem. For the developed fuzzy programming model, an α–search 
heuristic method is devised to generate a group of satisfactory solutions. The 
procedure of the α-search heuristic method is given as follows: 
 
Step 0: Initialization:  
Set K = maximal number of iterations, N = maximal number of stages, Rlow = lower 
bound for reliability, Rhigh = upper bound for reliability, △R = interval of increment for 
reliability, nlow = minimal components in each stage, nhigh = maximal components in 
each stage, Φ﹛﹜ = solution set, and α*(Φ) = critical overall satisfaction for 
satisfactory solutions. 
Step 1: Starting solution:  
Provide an initial solution: k =1, Rik  = Rlow, nik = nlow, i = 1,…,N. 
Step 2: Validation:  
Compute the satisfaction values for reliability fuzzy set, cost fuzzy set, weight fuzzy 
set, and volume fuzzy set. Calculate the overall satisfaction value for αk(Φ). If αk(Φ) 
> αk-1(Φ), place into the solution set Φ﹛﹜. If nik = nhigh and Rik = Rhigh, i = 1,…,N, go

Very often, the DEA model is weak in complete ranking of all DMUs because more SE 
DMUs can be generated from the DEA model. Jahanshahloo et al. [9] pointed out that if SE 
DMUs are excluded from the reference set of all the other DMUs and allow the efficient 
frontier to be closer in relation to the inefficient DMUs, then we can find the most efficient 
SE DMU. In order to perform this approach, the non-SE DMUs should be re-evaluated 
through the following model. 
proposed approach applying fuzzy-based DEA techniques combined with solution 
methods is implemented for solving this problem. 
 
Table 1 provides the design data for this study, which includes number of stages, 
reliability goal, the limit on reliability, cost, weight, and volume, and operational time. 
In the first place, the developed fuzzy programming technique is applied to obtain 
satisfactory solutions. Table 2 displays several satisfactory solutions obtained by the 
α-search heuristic method. We consider all the enumerations of α(Φ) which is just 
bigger than 0.995, so eight satisfactory solutions associated with the combinations 
of system reliability, system cost, system weight, and system volume are found. 
Each combination is associated with one value for α(Φ).

weight, and volume for the aircraft engine protection system. The reason for this is 
that the values for reliability and cost did not vary much with the change of α(Φ), 
while the values of weight and volume change significantly. Hence, system weight 
and volume factors play a key role in determining the most efficiency solution. 
Hence, the most satisfactory solution for the fuzzy programming problem using the 
α–search heuristic method does not necessarily equal the most efficiency solution 
using the complete DEA ranking method.

1. INTRODUCION 
 
An aircraft engine protection system is a key device for 
preventing aircrafts from malfunction. How to design a 
reliable engine protection system with lower cost and 
higher reliability is a very challenging task. The design 
methodology of series-parallel systems with redundant 
can be applied to reinforce the function of aircraft 
engine protection systems. Due to the incomplete or 
uncertain information about the design parameters 
during the early design phase, the traditional single- or 
multi-objective optimization techniques may not be 
appropriate to satisfactorily solve this problem. In order 
to tackle this problem, fuzzy goal programming 
technique combined with data envelopment analysis 
might be a good approach to provide an efficiency 
solution for the aircraft engine protection system. 
 
In this study, a fuzzy-based DEA reliability modeling 
approach is developed for dealing with the design of 
aircraft engine protection systems. First, a fuzzy-goal 
programming technique is utilized for solving 
series-parallel systems with redundant-design. A 
heuristic method is devised to generate a group of most 
satisfactory solutions.  Secondly, a design performance 
index is defined and DEA method is applied to 
completely rank those satisfactory solutions. Finally, the 
proposed approach is implemented using a real-world 
data to display the benefit of this study. 
 
2. LITERATURE REVIEW 
 
The reliability problem with series-parallel multi-stages 
systems can be improved using either of the following 
two methods: more reliable components or redundant 
components at single parallel structure.  Kuo and 
Prasad [10] considered that an exact algorithm of 
reliability optimization problems was not often easy to 
solve, even though there was a solution. Park [15] 
utilized the fuzzy set theory to analyze two components 
series system of reliability allocation problems. Zedeh 
and Bellman [18] designed a fuzzy-decision 
environment to provide different kinds of total solutions 
for design problems. Huang [8] proposed a fuzzy 
multi-objective optimization decision method that could 
provide two or more goals of reliability optimization 
decisions. Recently, Nakanishi and Nakayasu [14] used 
a reliability-based design method for a structural system 
by formulating an expected total cost concept.  Levitin 
[11] developed an algorithm for finding optimal 
series-parallel configuration for systems consisting of 
units characterized by different reliability and nominal 
performance rates. Levitin and Lisniaski [12] 
formulated a series-parallel multi-state system 
considering the choice of system elements in order to 
achieve a desired level of system survivability. Liang 
and Smith [13] applied an ant colony meta-heuristic 
optimization method to solve the redundancy allocation 
problem. Chen and You [4] presented a penalty-guided 
immune algorithms-based approach for solving an 
integer nonlinear redundant reliability design problem. 
Although the fuzzy programming or multi-objective 
programming technique can provide a satisfactory 
solution for the reliability problem, those approaches 
might not be able to give an efficiency solution under 
uncertain conditions.

 membership constraint functions (3), (4) are known in 
advance, the degree of satisfaction for those fuzzy 
functions can be calculated and the overall satisfaction 
can be obtained via seeking the intersection area of 
those fuzzy functions.  Mathematically, it is equivalent 
to find feasible solutions and an optimal solution with 
maximal value of α(Φ) using the following fuzzy 
programming problem.

The developed fuzzy programming model is one type of 
nonlinear problem, in which the fuzzy multi-objective 
programming problem is converted into a deterministic 
single objective problem. For the developed fuzzy 
programming model, an α–search heuristic method is 
devised to generate a group of satisfactory solutions. 
The procedure of the α-search heuristic method is given 
as follows: 
 
Step 0. Initialization: Set K = the maximal number of 
iterations, N = the number of stages, Rlow = lower 
bounds for reliability, Rhigh = upper bounds for reliability, 
Ri = interval of increment for reliability,  nlow = 
minimal components within each stage, nhigh = maximal 
components within each stage, Φ﹛ ﹜  = solution set, Q 
= maximal number of elements in solution set. 
Step 1. Starting solution: Provide an initial solution: k = 
1, Rik  = Rlow, nik = nlow, i = 1,…,N. Place them into the 
solution set Φ﹛ ﹜ . 
Step 2. Validation: Compute and compare the overall 
satisfaction αk (Φ) for the incumbent solution. If αk(Φ) >  
αk-1(Φ), replace the incumbent solution with previous 
solution in the solution set. If nik = nhigh and Rik = Rhigh, I 
 = 1,…,N, go to Step 4. Otherwise, go to Step 3. 
Step 3. Improvement: If Rik = Rhigh, then nik = nik+1 and  
Rik = Rlow. Otherwise, Rik  = Rik+1 +Ri, k = k+1. 
Compute the values for: 1. reliability fuzzy set and its  
degree of satisfaction; 2. cost fuzzy set and its degree of  
satisfaction; 3. weight fuzzy set and its degree of  
satisfaction; 4. volume fuzzy set and its degree of  
satisfaction. Return to Step 2 
Step 4. Generate a group of satisfactory solutions.

RANKING SATISFACTORY SOLUTION 
 
In this study, a completely ranking system for extreme 
efficient decision making units is developed. First, an

associated with the output y1p and y2p; and vi v2 and v3 
are weights associated with input x1p , x2p and x3p. For 
the pth decision-making unit (DMUp), one can find the 
weights that maximize the ratio output per input through 
the following mathematical model.

 Then the general DEA method is applied to rank those 
satisfactory solutions with satisfactory and reliability as 
output and cost, weight, and volume as input. Table 3 
shows the list of ranking from the efficient DMU to the 
least. There are two strong efficiency DMUs in this list, 
so the developed ranking model is applied further to 
show the complete ranking list. Table 4 displays the 
complete ranking results. The most efficiency solution 
appears when α ( Φ ) equals 0.997084 with Rs = 
0.989816, C = 300.087, W = 224.753, and V = 89.0. The 
highest value of α (Φ ) didn’t necessarily imply the 
best combination of reliability, cost, weight, and volume 
for the design system. The reason for this is that the 
values for reliability and cost didn’t vary much with the 
change of α (Φ ), while the values of weight and 
volume change significantly. Hence, system weight and 
system volume play the key role in determining the 
most efficiency solution. In other words, the most 
satisfactory solution for the fuzzy programming 
problem using the α–search heuristic method does not 
necessarily equal the most efficiency solution for the 
DEA model.

The results suggest that the developed fuzzy-based DEA 
technique provide higher quality solutions regardless of 
size and complexity of problems. When the information 
about the design parameters is uncertain or incomplete 
for the series-parallel systems with redundancy problem, 
the developed fuzzy-based DEA technique can be 
applied to provide an efficiency solution for decision 
maker. 
 
 
 
 
7. CONCLUSIONS 
 
An aircraft engine protection system is designed for 
preventing aircrafts from malfunction.  The task to 
design a reliable engine protection system with highest 
reliability while considering system cost, weight and 
volume constraint factors under an uncertain 
environment is performed in this study.  An approach 
of fuzzy-based DEA technique is developed and applied 
to reinforce the function of aircraft engine protection 
system.  A fuzzy programming problem is formulated 
and an α –search heuristic method is devised for 
finding a group of satisfactory solutions. An efficiency 
design indicator is defined. Then, a DEA method is 
applied for completely ranking those selected 
satisfactory solutions. A real-world data is collected and 
implemented. Results from this study suggest that the 
obtained most efficiency solution is not necessarily 
equal to the most satisfactory solution.  The developed 
approach is promising for designing reliable aircraft 
engine protection systems.
