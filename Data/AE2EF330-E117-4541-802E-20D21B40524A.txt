target and In2S3 binary target. Especially, 
sulfur incorporated method is employing 
co-sputter process which is different currently 
surface sulfurization method that utilized toxic 
H2S gas or S vapor. Then one-stage annealing 
process was performed to form CIGSS 
chalcopyrite phase without selenization and 
sulfurization. In this way, it is benefit to reduce 
the cost of selenization equipment apparatus and 
process time. This paper also investigates the 
effect of various annealing parameters on the 
compositional, structural, and electrical 
characteristics of CIGSS thin films. 
 
2. Experimental 
In this study, the main process is 
co-sputtering. It contains two kinds of targets. One 
is CIGS quaternary alloy target with compositions 
of Cu:In:Ga:Se = 25:17.5:7.5:50 at.%, and the 
other one is In2S3 ceramic target with 
compositions of In:S=40:60 at.%. For the part of 
CIGSS films preparation, firstly, CIGS films were 
deposited from CIGS quaternary target onto 
bi-layer Mo coated soda-lime glass (SLG) with 
size of 1.5×1×1 mm3. Then during the latter 
sputter process, In2S3 target were utilized 
co-sputtering technique, deposit the CIGSS films 
onto the CIGS films, and finally the CIGSS films 
with bi-layer In-rich/Cu-rich structure were 
prepared. CIGSS films were all prepared at power 
of 70 W (CIGS) and 30 W (In2S3), substrate 
temperature of 373 K, working pressure of 0.67 Pa. 
For the part of annealing process, it could be 
divided into two parts. Firstly, various annealing 
temperatures were investigated on the influences 
of films with soaking time fixed at 20 min for all 
samples. Secondly, from the experience obtained 
from above discussed, and choose an appropriate 
temperature with adjusting various soaking time 
from 10 to 60 min, and investigate the 
characterizations of CIGSS films. 
In order to investigate the annealing 
temperatures and various soaking times on the 
compositional, structural, morphological, and 
optoelectronic properties of CIGSS films, X-ray 
diffraction (XRD, CuKα, λ=1.54052Å) was 
utilized to investigate the crystalline structure of 
the CIGSS films. Glancing incident angle X-ray 
diffraction (GIXRD) technique was employed to 
investigate the surface crystalline phases and 
structures. And Raman measurement (Jobin Yvon 
Labram HR) was performed to double check the 
phase structures of CIGSS films at room 
temperature and a red laser with 633 nm 
wavelength as the light source. The stoichiometric 
ratio and depth profiles of the CIGSS films were 
analyzed by energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS, 
Hitachi S3000N) and secondary ion mass 
spectrometer (SIMS, IMS-6f), respectively. 
Resistivity, carrier concentration and carrier 
mobility were measured by Hall effect 
measurement apparatus (ECOPIA HMS-2000). 
. 
3.Results and Discussion  
3.1 CIGS and In2S3 targets analysis 
Figure 1 and 2 show the XRD pattern of 
CIGS quaternary target and In2S3 binary target, 
respectively. And the peaks corresponding to the 
reflections of CIGS chalcopyrite structure and 
In2S3 tetragonal structure are indentified by 
comparing with the JCPDS cards of 35-1102 and 
73-1366, respectively. From the Figure 1, the 
XRD pattern exhibits the diffraction peak intensity 
of (112) orientation of the CIGS target. On the 
other hand, the XRD spectra did not indicate the 
presentence of the additional peaks except 
CIGS-based peaks, which could be clearly 
indentified. Hence the CIGS quaternary target has 
the characterizations of chalcopyrite structures in 
itself. On the contrary, the XRD pattern of In2S3 
target shown in Figure 2 exhibits the presentence 
of atomic planes (109/213), (220/0012), (309/323), 
and (2212/400) of the tetragonal structures.

temperatures from 748 to 848 K are shown in 
Figure 5. All the CIGSS annealed films exhibit 
XRD peaks of (112) and two weak prominent 
peaks which belong to (220/204) and (312/116) of 
chalcopyrite structures, which revealed that the 
CIGSS films are polycrystalline and oriented 
along the (112) parallel to substrate. These peaks 
corresponding to the reflections of CuInSe2 and 
CuInS2 of chalcopyrite structure are indentified by 
comparing with the JCPDS cards of 40-1487 and 
89-6095, respectively. The XRD diffraction peak 
intensity of (112) orientation of the film after 
annealed at 798 K for 20 min improved noticeably 
and have the strongest diffraction intensity, which 
may attributed to the crystallization quality and 
grain growth. Besides, other complex peaks are 
not presented in the XRD patterns; it represents 
that one-stage annealing process is enough form 
chalcopyrite structure in this CIGSS thin films 
preparation process. And this is ascribed that the 
ramping rate in furnace annealing of this case is 
far slow than rapid thermal annealing (RTA) 
process, hence the duration to expected 
temperature allows enough time to form selenides 
and sulfides compounds ultimately CIGSS 
developed [11].

Fig.5 The XRD patterns of CIGSS films deposited 
at power of 70 W (CIGS) and 30 W (In2S3), 
substrate temperatures of 798 K, working pressure 
of 0.67 Pa and employed annealing process at 
various annealing temperatures for 20 min. 
 
Noticeably, with elevating annealing 
temperatures, the position of (112) peak seems 
move to lower diffraction angle an obvious (112) 
peak deviation occurred when annealing 
temperatures increase from 798K (2θ = 27.32o) to 
848 K (2θ = 27.16o). Compare with the result from 
the Figure 3, it indicates that the S content is 
decrease with elevating annealing temperatures, 
and result the re-evaporation of S that lead to a 
decrease in ratio of S substitute for Se atoms, 
lattice constant of absorber films would also 
increase, and finally cause the peaks deviated 
toward lower diffraction angles.

Fig.6 The FWHM of CIGSS thin films deposited at 
power of 70 W (CIGS) and 30 W (In2S3), substrate 
temperatures of 798 K, working pressure of 0.67 Pa 
and employed annealing process at various 
annealing for 20 min. 
 
The result of FWHM of CIGSS thin films 
that annealed at different annealing temperatures 
for 20 min is shown in Figure 6. From the figure, 
it indicates that the sample carried out the 
annealing process under the conditions of 798 K 
have better crystallinity compared with others 
samples. Furthermore, the FWHM value is 
corresponding to the ratio of S/(Se+S) [12], a 
larger amount of S replace with Se cause the 
diffraction peak deviate toward higher diffraction 
angle which means a smaller d-value and peak 
broadening, then results in increasing the FWHM 
value [12]. Hence collocate with Figure 4, it 
indicates that as sample annealed at 798 K, the 
smallest number of S atoms were incorporated 
into the CIGSS crystal lattice, then lead to the 
(112) peak narrowed and benefit in crystallinity, 
and the result is corresponding to the result of 
FWHM. 
Figure 7 shows the GIXRD pattern (incident 
angle = 2o) of CIGSS thin films annealed at 
 8 
and 30 W (In2S3), substrate temperatures of 798 K, 
working pressure of 0.67 Pa, and employed an 
annealing at 798 K for various soaking time. As 
can be seen from this data, the composition loss is 
much obviously while soaked for 10 min 
compared with other soaking time; however, for 
the samples after annealed at 798 K for 20 min or 
longer soaking time, the composition loss is 
unobvious, and it is attributed to the chalcopyrite 
phase have been formed, as seen in Figure 11, 
which belong to a stable structure, hence the 
composition losses are unobvious and almost 
maintain as constants.

temperature of 798 K, working pressure of 0.67 
Pa and employed annealing process at 798 K from 
10 to 60 min. 
 
In addition, the ratios of Cu/(In+Ga), 
Ga/(In+Ga), and S/(Se+S) of CIGSS films 
annealing at 798 K for different time are shown in 
Figure 10. As the same reason of above mentioned, 
the ratio of Cu/(In+Ga) and S/(Se+S) initially is at 
a higher value due to the chalcopyrite structure 
have not completely formed, and after 
chalcopyrite structure formed, the ratios are 
almost maintain at constant. 
XRD patterns of CIGSS thin films annealed 
at 798 K for various time are shown in Figure 11. 
It could be seen that all films have the basic 
chalcopyrite structure of (112) diffraction peak 
and very similar XRD pattern. Interestingly, the 
chalcopyrite main (112) peak did not deviate with 
increase of soaking time, which indicates that the 
composition is independent with soaking time and 
corresponding to the result of above section in this 
study. However, there is a noticeable change of the 
sample with annealed for 30 min as compared 
with other samples. After annealed at 798 K for 
proper time, the superior structure properties of 
CIGSS thin films were clearly reflected by XRD 
studies. The XRD diffraction peak intensity of 
(112) orientation of the film after annealed for 30 
min improved noticeably and have the strong 
intensity, which may attributed to the 
crystallization quality and grain growth 
corresponding to the result of FWHM. Moreover, 
it could be explained that the reaction of gallium 
needs longer annealing time to react with other 
reactants [14].

Figure 14 shows the result of electric 
properties of CIGSS films after annealing at 798 
K for different soaking time obtained from Hall 
effect measurement apparatus. From the data, 
resistivity increase with prolonging soaking time, 
which is attributed to that longer soaking time at 
high temperature may easily cause Se and/or S 
deficient atmosphere, hence if samples were 
annealed under such condition, the resistivity 
would increase dramatically. It is worthy to note 
that the samples annealed for 50 and 60 min may 
attributed to ODC phase formed on the surface of 
CIGSS films due to its high resistivity and low 
carrier concentration [15]; in addition, from the 
point of composition, these films were still 
exhibited in In-rich, which is also the evidence of 
the existence of ODC phases, and it was 
corresponding to the results that proposed by 
many research groups [16]. Thus, the XRD pattern 
did not show the present the characterization of 
ODC phase. However, it is noted that because 
ODC phase may exist as a very thin layer on the 
surface region, the XRD data may not truly 
represent the structure of the surface [17]. 
Furthermore, while annealed for shorter soaking 
time, the samples exhibited in p-type materials, 
whereas CIGSS films annealed at 798 K for 50 
and 60 min, the conductivity turned into n-type, 
which also support the inference of ODC 
formation at the surface region of these two 
samples. And the result of Raman spectrum shown 
in Figure 18 also indicates the presence of ODC 
phases, which is corresponding to the result of 
electivity. 
In summary, from the above obtained results 
we could know that, the CIGSS thin film after 
annealing while annealing temperature reaches to 
798 K for 30 min have the optimal crystallinity 
and stoichiometry, and the electric properties of 
resistivity, carrier concentration, and Hall mobility 
of the film were 14.77868 (Ω-cm), 3.4346×1017 
(cm-3), and 1.22691 (cm2V-1s-1), respectively. The 
whole bulk exhibited p-type, and these results are 
corresponding to the request of CIGS thin films 
[18]. In next section, the CIGSS film annealed 
under the optimal annealing parameter would be 
further investigated to examine the feasibility for 
CIGSS films. 
 
3-4 The influences of properties of CIGSS films 
obtained from the optimal conditions 
SIMS analysis in adopted in this study to 
investigate the depth distribution of each element. 
Figure 15 and 16 demonstrated the CIGSS thin 
films as-deposited and annealed at 798 K for 30 
min, respectively. From the former figure, it 
reveals that an obvious bi-layer structure consists 
by the In-rich at the surface region and Cu-rich in 
deep film of the as-deposited CIGSS thin film.  
And noticeably, while starting co-sputtering, the 
addition of In2S3 could also enhance the 
concentration of Cu, Ga, and Se elements, which 
represents that CIGSS films prepared by 
co-sputter process could elevate carrier 
concentration distributions effectively, but the 
mechanism are still unknown and wait for further 
investigation. After annealing treatment, as like 
shown in Figure 16, the depth distribution of 
elements are much uniform distribution due to the 
annealing treatment process could improve the 
inter-diffusion and activation of each element. 
And the depth distribution profile of S element in 
Figure 16 has an additional hump near the 
Mo/absorber layer interface; this behavior could 
be explained by the micro-structure exist 
differences between surface and deep regions of 
thin film. This result is similar to the investigation 
of B.M. Başol et al. they proposed that the S 
diffusion route in In-rich thin film is different 
from near-stoichiometric and Cu-rich films [19].

film which deposited at power of 70 W (CIGS) 
and 30 W (In2S3), substrate temperature of 798 K, 
working pressure of 0.67 Pa. 
 
In addition, the re-evaporation phenomena of 
group VI elements (Se and S) are not discovered 
in the surface region from the SIMS depth profile 
during annealing process. This result may 
correspond to the result of GIXRD patterns of 
Figure 17. Simultaneously, the SIMS results also 
 12 
atoms remaining at rest [20]. The shoulder 
observed of the Al mode main peak of CuGaSe2 at 
161 and 225 cm-1 are probably the A1 and E 
modes of CuGa3Se5, respectively. And another 
OVC peak of B1 mode of CuIn3Se5 is also 
observed at 129 cm-1 [21]. The Al mode of CuInS2 
is observed at 290 cm-1, which is corresponded to 
the investigation of Bacewicz et al. [22] who 
studied CuInS2xSe2(1-x) mixed crystals. The 
shoulder of the A1 mode peak of CuInS2 is 
observed at higher frequency of about 321 cm-1, 
which is probably attributed to the ordered 
vacancy compound of CuIn5S8 as the investigation 
of Álvarez-Garcia et al. [23] that point to the 
existence of this secondary phase within the 
structure. Cu-Se phase is usually performed at 
about 261 cm-1 of vibration frequency. However in 
this case, there is no obviously evidence to prove 
its existence regardless of Raman spectrum or 
XRD patterns. Hence the CIGSS thin film 
prepared by co-sputtering process could avoid the 
formation of Cu-Se and/or Cu-S phases. In this 
Raman spectra analysis, it shows the existence of 
many different phases such as CuInSe2, CuGaSe2, 
and CuInS2, but does not indicated the presence of 
possible CuGaS2 and CuInGaSe2 phases. This may 
be explained by the fact that the vibration 
frequencies of In–Se, In–S bonds are similar to the 
Ga–Se and Ga–S bonds [24], and therefore the 
peaks would easily overlap. 
 
4. Conclusions 
In this study, CIGSS thin films was deposited 
onto the bi-layer Mo coated soda-lime glass by 
co-sputtering of CIGS quaternary alloy target and 
In2S3 binary target. Then CIGSS chalcopyrite 
phase was formed by means of annealing 
treatment process. Noticeably, the preparation 
method of CIGSS films without post-selenization 
in this study, which is different from the current 
two-stage processes. And the conclusions of thesis 
are summarized as follows: 
(1) One-stage annealing process is suitable for 
pentanary CIGSS films prepared by this 
co-sputter process due to no other secondary 
phases were presented regardless of the 
whole bulk or surface region of films. 
Especially such as CuSe (or CuS, Cu(Se,S)) 
phases, which would easily exhibit in 
currently two-stage process 
(selenization/sulfrization). 
(2) Co-sputter process would enhance the carrier 
concentration distribution of Cu, Ga, and Se 
elements during the preparation of CIGSS 
films. 
(3) CIGSS films with double graded energy 
band-gap could be obtained by co-sputter 
process via CIGS quaternary alloy target and 
In2S3 binary target with one-stage annealing 
process. 
(4) In this study, by means of this co-sputter 
process, ODC phases were exhibited in the 
surface region, and it could form the p-n 
heterojunction in absorber layer.    
(5) While CIGSS films were employed 
one-stage process at 798 K for 30 min, the 
sample had the optimal crystallinity, and 
composition is approach to the ideal 
stoichiometry (Cu: 24.25 at.%, In: 19.57 
at.%, Ga: 6.82 at.%, Se: 28.47 at.%, S:20.90 
at.%), with Cu/(In+Ga) = 0.92, 
Ga/(In+Ga)=0.26, and S/(Se+S)=0.42. The 
resistivity was 14.77867 (Ω·cm), carrier 
concentration was 3.4346 × 1017 (cm-3), and 
mobility was 1.22691 (cm2V-1s-1). In 
addition, the theoretically energy band-gap 
is 1.396 eV, which is close to the 
theoretically ideal energy band gap. The 
whole film exhibited in p-type conductivity. 
Brought forward, the CIGSS sample is 
suitable for the preparation of absorber layer 
of thin-film solar cell.

本次會議是在中國青島舉辦的The 2nd International Conference on Multi-functional 
Materials and Structures (MFMS 2009)國際研討會。本次會議的時間為 2009年10月9
日至10月12日，分類如下： 
Theme 1: Smart Materials and Structures 
Theme 2: Nano-materials and Nano-technology 
Theme 3: Coating and Thin Film Technologies 
Theme 4: Materials Corrosion and Protection 
Theme 5: Computer Modeling and Analysis 
Symposium: Natural Fiber Composites Symposium 
Theme 6: New Technologies of Materials Preparation 
等7個大主題，本次會議提供了一個相當好的知識交流平台，提供與會的研究者交
換最新的研究成果，並討論薄膜與奈米科技在未來的研究方向與趨勢。整體而言，
會議所涵蓋的範圍包含了智慧材料、薄膜與奈米的機械、製程、材料、及元件應
用等等，參與的學者橫跨物理、化學、材料、機電、生物、能源等領域的大師，
大家齊聚一堂共同討論薄膜與奈米科技在各種不同領域的最新研究成果與應用，
對於未來薄膜與奈米的研究也有很大的助益。 
本次會議的投稿論文約為 1500篇（大會宣稱），總共錄取的篇數為 550篇，約為 
37%。總共的作者人數約為 400人，分佈在20個不同的國家，包含澳洲、加拿大、
中國、法國、德國、日本、印度、台灣.. 等等，被錄取的文章中，數量最多的是
大陸，約佔總論文數之65%。在大會中口頭發表 240篇，海報發表為310篇。在本
次會議中，來自於美國的文章，及歐洲國家文章並不多。此行最大的收穫為獲得
生物及能源（太陽光電）薄膜相關研究上最新的發展趨勢，對於今後研究計畫的
執行與未來研究方向的規劃將有莫大的助益，本次會議由於主題眾多，因此分為3
天舉行，同時之間只有3-4個不同主題的研究在進行報告，對於想多方面了解各國
在不同領域研究現況的我，有一些想了解的主題，還是會因為時間的重疊而無法
參與，幸而可就大會所整理的論文集而加以了解。
