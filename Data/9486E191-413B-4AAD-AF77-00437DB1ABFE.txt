2. ABSTRACT 
A photopolymer material was applied in 
liquid rapid prototyping (RP) machine. The 
prototype fabricated from photopolymer 
was difficult for storage due to volumetric 
shrinkage and deformation during curing. 
The prototype fabricated from 
photopolymer suffers from the volumetric 
shrinkage during curing and the continuing 
deformation for a creeping period after 
curing. Therefore, we used nano-SiO2 as a 
major additive to modify the physical 
properties of photopolymer. We also added 
appropriate dispersant to make 
nano-particles distribute uniformly in order 
to reduce the phase separation in composite 
material. The experimental results showed 
that photopolymer/SiO2 nano-composite 
can improve tensile strength and hardness 
by about 50% and offers better dimensional 
stability. Photopolymer/SiO2 nano- 
composite can also increase the degradation 
temperature and shorten manufacturing time 
for RP processing.

3. INTRODUCTION 
In general, there were solid, powdery and 
liquid materials available for rapid 
prototyping (RP). The most often used 
material in liquid RP system was 
photopolymer, which was cured through 
optical radiation in points, lines and areas to 
fabricate the prototype. Currently, liquid RP 
machines include SLA (stereolithography 
apparatus, manufactured by 3D Systems 
Inc.), SGC (solid ground curing systems, 
manufactured by Cubital Inc.), SCS (solid 
creation system, manufactured by D-MEC 
Ltd.), SOUP (solid object ultraviolet-laser 
printer, manufactured by CMET Inc.), and 
  3
rapid prototyping technology of the 
photopolymer/SiO2 nano-composite were 
verified. 
4. EXPERIMENTS 
This section describes reagents used, the 
preparation steps as well as experimental 
items.

5. nano-SiO2

Material preparation steps 
At first, the dispersant was filled into TPA, 
and stirred for 30 minutes by a 1000rpm 
stirrer. Second, nano-SiO2 was added into 
resin containing dispersant, and stirred for 
24 hours at 1000rpm under room 
temperature. The third, HDDA and 
photoinitiator were added into the mixing 
resin, and stirred for 30 minutes at 1000rpm. 
The recipe mixed from resin in 
above-specified manner was listed in 
TABLE I. The unit “phr” meant the parts 
per hundred parts of TPA/HDDA resin. 
Scanning electron microscopy 
In order to know the dispersion of 
nano-SiO2 in the mixing resin, a scanning 
electron microscope, Cambridge S-360, was 
used to observe the surface feature and 
phase distribution of gold-plated test piece 
with a 1000 times magnification factor. 
Rigid-body pendulum rheometer7, 8 
A rigid-body pendulum rheometer, model 
RPT-alpha 100, manufactured by Tohoku 
Electronic Industrial Co. Ltd. was used in 
this experiment and its typical curing curve 
was shown in Figure 1. The analytical 
principle was explained below: chemical 
cross-linking occurs at point 2 in curve, and 
the oscillation period starts to decline; the 
first point of inflection is the gel point and 
the corresponding time means the gel time; 
slop of 3->4 represents the cross-linking 
speed of materials, namely, the reaction 
speed; the curve becomes gentle at point 6, 
indicating that the reaction has reached a 
  5
We can observe the photo-curing behavior 
of photopolymer through a rapid-body 
pendulum reheometer during curing. The 
inflection points and the curing times were 
obtained from RPT instrument. The results 
showed that the curing time of S00D000 was 
110 seconds and the slope between gel point 
and curing point for curing was about 2.5. 
In Figure 3, the curing time of S05D000 was 
95 seconds, which is 15 seconds faster than 
S00D000. It showed that curing reaction time 
was shortened and reaction speed became 
faster for the sample with nano-SiO2. By 
further incorporating dispersant into the 
composite resin, the curing reaction time 
can be reduced to 90 seconds, as shown in 
the curve of S05D005. In Figure 4, the curing 
reaction time was also shorter after adding 
nano-SiO2 1phr and dispersant into the 
sample S00D000. In other words, the 
manufacturing time of prototypes were 
shortened during RP processing. 
Analysis of thermal property 
The degradation temperature and thermal 
stability of polymer was investigated with 
analysis of TGA. These properties are 
critical to the storage of prototypes. Figure 
5 depicted TGA test results, wherein the 
initial degradation temperature of S00D000 
was approximately 268 °C, and complete 
degradation temperature was approximately 
489 °C. The initial degradation temperature 
of S05D000 was approximately 335 °C, and 
complete degradation temperature was 
approximately 507 °C. As seen from the 
curves of S00D000 and S05D000, additive of 
nano-SiO2 can increase the degradation 
temperature of TPA/HDDA resin. The 
initial degradation temperature of S05D025 
was approximately 340 °C, and complete 
degradation temperature was approximately 
507°C. It was shown that, additive of 
dispersant had no influence on the 
degradation temperature. The initial 
degradation temperature of S10D100 was 
approximately 324°C, and complete 
degradation temperature was approximately 
557°C. The degradation temperature of 
S10D100 increased about 60°C as compared 
with the sample S00D000. These results 
showed that the degradation temperature 
and thermal stability were increased 
efficiently through adding nano-SiO2 into 
TPA/HDDA resin. 
Analysis of mechanical properties 
According to Cheah et al.,2 the tensile 
strength was increased through adding 20 
vol. percentage short-fiber reinforcements. 
According to Zak et al.,3 the modulus of 
prototype was increased by adding short 
glass fiber of 20% volume ratio. However, 
they used lots of reinforcements into the 
photopolymer. We adopted nano-composites 
to improve the mechanical properties of 
photopolymer, the amounts of additive of 
nano-particles in our method were only 
0.5phr and 1phr. 
The results of tensile strength test were 
listed in TABLE II, wherein the tensile 
strength of S00D000 was 1.6 kgf/cm2. The 
results showed that additive of nano-SiO2 
can improve the tensile strength. The data 
of tensile strength were decreased though 
adding excess dispersant into the mixed 
resin, such as S05D050, S10D100, etc. The 
sample S10D010 had the highest tensile 
  7
(2) RPT test showed that additive of 
nano-SiO2 can improve the reaction 
speed, and lead to a shorter 
manufacturing time during RP 
processing. The results of TGA test 
showed that it was possible to increase 
the degradation temperature of 
photopolymer by adding nano-SiO2 into 
the composite system.  
(3) The curing thickness of photopolymer 
was increased with additive of 
nano-SiO2, but it was decreased by 
adding dispersant. The tensile strength 
and hardness can increase by 50% after 
adding nano-SiO2 and appropriate 
dispersant into TPA/HDDA resin. 
Additive of nano-SiO2 doesn’t affect the 
volumetric shrinkage during curing, and 
the finished prototypes of 
photopolymer/SiO2 nano-composite can 
have good dimensional stability.
