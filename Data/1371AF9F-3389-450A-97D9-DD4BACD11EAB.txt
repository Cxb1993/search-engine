3-1. Model Formulation 
The finite element model of laser 
reformation comprises two parts: heat 
transfer from laser illumination and profile 
transformation due to fluidal movement of 
molten Si. An illustration of the model is 
shown in Fig. 1. Ωa is the illuminated region 
of the Si waveguide. Ωm is the molten Si, Ωsi 
is the solid Si. Γ1 is the boundary between Si 
and vacuum. Γm is the solid-liquid interface, 
also called the melting-front position. Γ2  and 
Γ3 (dashed line) are the boundary of Si wafer.

model describing inclined incidence of high 
energy laser pulses onto the Si waveguide. 
Laser energy converts to heat and 
becomes a heat generation source at the 
illuminated sidewalls. The heat transfer 
equation in Si has the weak form [11, 12]:

where T(x,y,t) is the temperature distribution, 
w is an arbitrary weight function, k1 and k2 is 
the thermal conductivities of solid and liquid 
phase Si, g(t) is the heat generation rate per 
unit area at the illuminated surfaces [1], α is 
the absorption coefficient at the wavelength 
of 248 nm [13]. ρ is the density of Si, cv is the 
specific heat of Si, and Hl is the latent heat of 
liquid phase Si [11]. The overall Si region (Ω) 
includes the molten Si (Ωm) and the solid 
phase Si (Ω1). The exchange region 
)}(),({ ttt

δ+ΓΓΩ  is where Si melts or 
recrystallizes in a short duration of time. 
Because the illumination takes place at 
the base pressure of 10-6, the boundary Γ1 
does not lose heat by convection but by 
radiation. However, the heat loss at the air-Si 
interface only affects the calculated surface 
temperature to less than 1%. Assuming the 
lateral boundary Γ2 have no heat flux to 
adjacent area and the vertical boundary Γ3 is 
at room temperature, the boundary conditions 
are:

The temperature at the solid-liquid interface 
Γm is equal to the melting temperature of Si, 
Tmp. It is given as a function of time by: 
 
mpm TttT =Γ )),((  (3) 
The finite element model of Eqs.(1)-(3) 
is formulated based on the Galerkin method. 
A backward difference scheme is used and, 
for stability, the temperature-dependent 
thermal conductivity and the specific heat of 
Si [11] are assumed to depend only on the 
temperature of past time. The solid-liquid 
interface is unknown in the first place and 
has to be solved by iteration. A variant of 
Newton’s method is developed for efficient 
iteration and will be described in Sec. 3-2.  
The profile transformation is calculated 
from the temperature distribution solved 
from Eqs. (1)-(3). Assuming the movement 
of molten Si is steady-state, incompressible, 
non-convective, the governing equation has 
the weak form [11]:

After a short sequence of the 
melting-front position at each observation 
point are obtained, the better guess values 
based on the difference sequence at each 
observation point is calculated. A curves 
composed by these guess values is then used 
in the next iteration. The order of the 
polynomial to represent the solid-liquid 
interface Γm is equal to the number of 
observation points.  
By this variant Newton's method, we 
can obtain solutions to Eqs. (1)-(3) fo 
temperature distribution in a faster way. The 
profile transformation model consists of 
uncoupled linear equations and thus can be 
directly solved once the temperature 
distribution is calculated from the heat 
transfer model. 
3-3. Optical Mode Simulation 
After the transformed profile is obtained 
by the finite element model above, optical 
propagation mode is then calculated. An 
imaginary distance beam-propagation- 
method is employed here [15]. The electric 
field distribution of the propagation light, 
noted as E, is give by the following paraxial 
wave equation:

4. Results and Discussion 
The cross-sectional profile of Si 
waveguide fabricated by reactive ion etch is 
shown in Fig. 5, where the height and width 
are both 500 nm [2]. It is illuminated by KrF 
excimer laser pulses with an energy density 
of 1.4 J/cm2 at an incident angle of 15o on the 
sidewall. The heated Si surface melts and 
reforms due to the surface tension. The 
waveguide profile is transformed to a shape 
of dome, as shown in Fig. 6. The width at the 
etched basin becomes 630 nm and the height 
reduces to 490 nm.  
Assume that the unclad waveguides are 
clad with a SiO2 bottom layer with a 
thickness of 2µm, the etched basin has a 
residual thickness of 200 nm, and a beam 
with a wavelength of 1.55µm is employed. 
Both of the propagation modes before and 
after laser reformation are then calculated by 
the imaginary-distance beam propagation 
method. The electric field distribution in both 
cases is shown as enclosed curves in Fig. 5 
and Fig. 6, where the electric field intensities

converted from laser energy dissipates, the Si recrystallizes 
back to the surface [8]. During the process, the wafer is placed 
at a base pressure of 10-6 torr. 
The finite element model of laser reformation therefore 
comprises two parts: the heat transfer model during laser 
illumination and the profile transformation model due to the 
fluidal movement of molten Si. An illustration of the heat 
transfer model is shown in Fig. 2. Ωa is the light absorption 
region of the Si surface, Ωm is the molten Si, and Ωsi is the solid 
Si. Γm is the solid-liquid interface, also called the melting-front 
position. Γ0 is the center of the protrusion, Γ1 is the boundary 
between Si and the ambient, Γ2  is the lateral end of the Si wafer, 
and Γ3 is the bottom end of the Si wafer. 
During the laser illumination, the light energy is absorbed 
in Si within about 10 nm and converts to heat. The light 
absorption region Ωa becomes a heat generation source. The 
heat then transfers into the Si wafer by means of heat 
conduction. The heat transfer equation in the cylindrical 
coordinates has the weak form [1, 8, 9]:

δ+ΓΓΩ  is where Si melts or recrystallizes in a short 
duration of time. 
The first term in Eq. (1) describes the heat conduction in 
the molten Si, the second term describes the heat conduction in 
the solid Si, the third term describes the heat generation from 
laser pulses as well as heat stored in Si, and the fourth term 
describes the exchange of heat due to solid-liquid transition. 
No cyclic heat current is included in Eq. (1). As the wafer 
is placed at the base pressure of 10-6, a little amount of heat 
also transfers to the ambient through radiation. The heat loss at 
the air-Si interface only affects the calculated surface 
temperature to less than 1% so this loss component is not 
included in Eq. (1) for simplicity. As to the other boundary 
conditions, no heat conduction is allowed at the center of the 
protrusion Γ0 because of the axis-symmetry. Assuming no heat 
flows to the adjacent area beyond Γ2 and the temperature at the 
vertical boundary Γ3 is at room temperature, the boundary

Si is steady-state, incompressible, non-convective, and

In average cases, it approaches the solution within 10-6 
deviation in ten iterations. 
In the current quasi-three-dimensional model, the variant 
Newton's method is also applicable. First, a few observation 
points at different radial position is arbitrarily chosen, for 
example, L(1), L(2), L(3), as shown in Fig. 5. At first iteration, a 
guess curve of the solid-liquid interface Γm0 is used to calculate 
the temperature distribution by Eq. (1). The solid-liquid 
interface is now Γm1. The melting-front position at the 
observation points are z(i)m1. Γm1 is then used as the new guess 
curve in the next iteration.  
After a short sequence of the melting-front position at 
each observation point are obtained, the better guess values 
based on the difference sequence at each observation point is 
calculated. A curves composed by these guess values is then 
used in the next iteration. The order of the polynomial to 
represent the solid-liquid interface Γm is equal to the number of 
observation points.  
The profile transformation model consists of uncoupled 
linear equations and can be directly solved once the temperature 
distribution is calculated from the heat transfer model. 
4   Results 
Instantaneous temperature distribution of a single Si 
protrusion is calculated from the heat transfer model using the 
variant Newton's method and shown in Fig. 6. The shape of the 
laser pulse used in the simulation is the same as that in the 
former experiments [1], with a FWHM pulse duration of 25 ns. 
The simulation time step is 18 ns after the laser pulse begins, the 
energy density is 1.4 J/cm2. The instantaneous profile 
transformation, or the motion of the mesh, is calculated from the 
temperature distribution in Fig. 6 and shown in Fig. 7. 
During the simulation, the gravitational force has found to 
have slightest effect on the fluidal movement of molten Si. The 
fluidal velocity is affected by the gravitational force in less than 
10-6 of its value. Therefore, the variation of surface tension due 
to the temperature gradient, i.e. the fourth term in Eqs. (4) and 
(5), is suggested being the most influential factor in the motion 
of the molten Si. 
The temperature in the Si protrusion is higher than that in 
the lateral area, as shown in Fig. 6. The localized heat in the 
protrusion results in a temperature gradient over the Si surface. 
The magnitude of the temperature gradient is about 20 K/nm 
and exists over a few hundreds of nm perimeter. Excessive 
surface tension is produced by such temperature gradient and 
pulls the molten Si away from the center of the protrusion to the 
lateral area, as shown in Fig. 7. 
The excessive surface tension acts at the Si surface. As 
the magnitude of the temperature gradient does not vary 
significantly on the surface of the protrusion (within 100 nm) 
and its lateral lobe, the resulted traction force therefore remains 
roughly the same order of magnitude in these areas. However, 
the movement of molten Si at the protrusion surface is more 
significant than the lateral lobe, as shown in Fig. 7. This is 
because the excessive surface tension over the protrusion has 
both lateral and vertical components so that the molten Si there 
can move both vertically and laterally. The molten Si around the
