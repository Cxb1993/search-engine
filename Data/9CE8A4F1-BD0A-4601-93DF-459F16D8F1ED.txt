In this project, we have developed cognitive radio technologies in three aspects: (1) single cognitive 
user transmit beamforming, (2) single cognitive user receive beamforming, and (3) multiple user joint 
optimization of transmit and receive beamforming. These three research results are accepted in IEEE 
Trans. on Vehicular Technologies, presented IEEE ICC 2010, IEEE APWCS 2010, and submitted to ICC 
2011, respectively.  
As to single cognitive user transmit beamforming, we present a novel scheme that aligns the 
interference from the antennas of the cognitive user (CU) such that the interference to the primary user 
(PU) is nullified or minimized. The two-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) interference channel 
is considered. We assume that the transmission bandwidth of the CU is wider than that of the PU, and the 
spectrum of the PU is called victim band. Because of the unequal transmission bandwidth, the sampling 
rates of the two users are not necessarily equal. Two sources of interferences are considered in the 
alignment. One source is the spatial interference from different antennas of the CU. The other source is 
the inter-carrier interference (ICI) from the in-victim band of CU to the victim band of PU. An active 
antenna of the cognitive user is used to align with the spatial interference from the antennas of the 
cognitive user and ICI such that the interference to the PU is nullified. The simulation shows that the 
scheme created a >100dB notch on the transmission spectrum of the victim band. This scheme allows the 
CU to utilize the victim band simultaneously with the PU and leads to underlay cognitive radio 
transmission. We also present a soft successive interference cancellation at the receiver of the CU to 
detect the signal within the victim band. The error performance at the cognitive receiver of this underlay 
cognitive radio system is presented as well. 
    As to single cognitive user receiving beamforming, the two-user multiple-input multiple-output 
(MIMO) interference channel is considered. We present a MIMO receiving beamforming scheme of the 
cognitive user (CU) to avoid narrowband interference(NBI) from the primary user (PU). The CU seeks 
the opportunity of transmission over the victim band simultaneously with the PU. The transmission error 
performance of the CU is optimized with the constraint of minimized narrowband interference to the PU 
in the victim band. The compromise between the CU transmission performance and the producing 
narrowband interference is also analyzed. The BER and capacity trade-off are illustrated. 
   As to multiple user joint optimization of transmit and receive beamforming, we aim to design a set of 
linear precoding matrices and the corresponding decoding matrices via maximizing the sum capacity to 
achieve the maximal degrees of freedom (DoF) on K-user MIMO interference channel. The existing 
iterative interference alignment (IIA) algorithms provided a suboptimal solution to maximum the sum 
capacity, which minimize the interference caused by others. While the IIA has attracted much attention in 
recent years, joint consideration of sum capacity and distribution of DoF is less address. Besides, the 
achievable DoF has been still an open issue for K-user MIMO interference channels. In this paper, an IIA 
algorithm is presented for joint DoF and sum capacity optimization. The number of data streams for each 
user is optimized and power allocation is also considered. Simulation results are compared to existing IIA 
schemes and show that the proposed algorithm outperforms in terms of sum capacity.

I. 前言 
Nowadays, radio electromagnetic spectrum has become a very precious naturalistic resource in 
wireless communication. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the united States and its 
counterparts around the world allocate a wide range of radio spectrum with varying channel bandwidth. 
However, since wireless services have begun proliferating, there is little radio frequency spectrum left 
over [1]. The chances of two different wireless systems colliding with each other somewhere for some 
time have increased[2]. For example, in the ultra-wide band (UWB) technique, the FCC allocated band 
for unlicensed devices or users who want to access the UWB[3]. However, a narrowband of the spectrum 
may have been used by other primary users, for instance, the IEEE 802.16e(or WiMAX) system. A 
promising solution for this problem is the cognitive radio (CR) technology with Detect and Avoidance 
(DAA) capability [3][4]. DAA initial detects the narrowband interference (NBI) from the primary user 
and then shapes its transmitting power spectrum to avoid NBI with the primary user. 
In a K-user MIMO interference channel, each user tries to communicate between the transmitter and 
the receiver. The transmitter encodes the data stream and makes an effort to resist the interference from 
other users. The performance of a K-user MIMO interference system is measured by the sum capacity. 
Each receiver in IA may divide the received space into signal subspace and interference subspace. It aims 
to design precoders and decoders that align signal to signal subspace and interference to another as 
possible. By projecting the received signal into signal subspace and removing the interference, the 
transmit performance of sum capacity is then enhanced. 
 
II. 研究目的 
The cognitive radio has been advocated to develop dynamic spectrum access technologies and to 
achieve the goal of opportunistic spectrum sharing in a prioritized multi-user communication network. 
The fundamental requirements of cognitive radio users are (1) to perform spectrum sensing to detect the 
presence of the primary users, and (2) to avoid transmission of interference to the primary users. Most 
research literatures focus on overlay cognitive radio that the cognitive users are not allowed to share the 
spectrum with the primary users. The cognitive user adopts DAA strategy to ensure exclusive usage of 
spectrum with the primary users. However, from the information theory and signal processing 
perspectives, it is possible to explore the degrees of freedom or physical resources left available from 
primary users and share the spectrum simultaneously. In this project, we are specifically interested in 
devising the most appropriate form of concurrent communications of cognitive users with constraints of 
limited or null interference to the primary users which is also called underlay cognitive radio[6][7]. 
As to single cognitive user transmit beamforming, we assume a cognitive user with a MIMO OFDM 
system operating in a wide spectrum. The primary user operates at a narrower channel bandwidth in 
overlap with the cognitive user. Therefore, with the two services trying to function simultaneously, the 
narrowband of the primary user becomes a victim band. The conventional CR approach would require the 
cognitive user to provide DAA capability so that the second user operation would not interfere with the 
primary user at the expense of using this victim band. In this paper, we seek the possibility that the 
cognitive user could still utilize the victim band for its data transmission, with the condition that the 
cognitive user does not interfere with the primary users operation. This shows that the power spectrum is 
still below the sensitivity level of the primary user. The receiver of the cognitive user employs MIMO 
 6
 
The channel transfer matrix from transmitter j∈{1,2} to receiver i∈{1,2} is denoted Hi,j, where the 
entries of Hi,j are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) complex Gaussian circularly symmetric 
random variables. The PU is indexed as user 1 and the CU is indexed as user 2. Therefore, with all the Nc 
subcarriers in the OFDM, the channel matrix between the cognitive transmitter and the cognitive receiver 
is represented as H22∈ (Mrc× Nc)
 
×  (Mtc× Nc)
. The kth row and the lth column entry in H22(k, l) is an Mrc×
Mtc sub-matrix representing the intercarrier interference from subcarrier l to subcarrier k, if k ≠ l. H22(k, l) 
also represents the Mrc× Mtc MIMO channel matrix for subcarrier k, if l = k.  
The interference channel from the cognitive transmitter and the primary user is H12∈  (Mp× Nc) ×  
(Mtc× Nc)
. The interference channel from the primary user to the cognitive transmitter is H21∈  (Mtc× Nc) ×
(Mp× Nc)
. The channel matrices are assumed to be stationary over the transmission period and all the 
channel state information (CSI) are available to the cognitive user. We assume that the transmission 
bandwidth of the CU is wider than that of the PU. The narrower spectrum of the PU is called victim 
band, which spans over v subcarriers in the CU. 
• System Model of Multiple Users  
This paper considers the scenario of K-user MIMO interference channel as Fig. 1. The kth transmitter and 
receiver are equipped with 
,t kN  and ,r kN  antennas respectively. We assume the k
th
 transmitter tries to send 
data toward its corresponding receiver by passing through the communicating link, 
,k kH . However, the 
receiver might face interference from other users through interfering link, 
,
, k lH l k∀ ≠ . Then the received 
signal at receiver k can be characterized as follow:

where { }1, ,k K∈ …  is the user index, ky  is the , 1r kN ×  received signal vector of the kth receiver, ks  is 
the 
,
1s kN ×  information vector which transmitter k wishes to send to its receiver, kW  is the , ,t k s kN N×  
precoding matrix with comprising of 
,s kN  linear independent beamforming vectors, and kn  is , 1r kN ×
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) vector at the kth receiver. We assume all noise terms are i.i.d. zero 
mean complex Gaussian with variance, 2Nσ . Input power constraint 
H H
k k k k kP  =  E s W W s  is imposed on 
each user, where ( )H⋅  denotes Hermitian transpose. We consider quasi-static flat fading channel and perfect 
knowledge of all channel coefficients is available to all transmitters and receivers. 
The main idea of interference alignment is to re-plan of the usage of received space by designing the 
precoding matrices { } 1Kk k =W  and decoding matrices { } 1Kk k =G  at transmitter and receiver respectively for 
each user. In particular, transmitter k transmitted 
,s kN  streams coded by precoding matrix, kW , which 
spans the signal subspace of ,r kNℂ  at receiver k and constructs interference subspace at other receivers. 
Further, at each receiver, we desire the interference subspace is orthogonal to the signal space. In other 
words, we are dying to align the signal to the 
,s kN  numbers of linear basis of ,r k
N
ℂ  as signal space and 
place the interference to the remaining 
, ,r k s kN N−  of linear basis of ,r k
N
ℂ  as interference space. Then 
decoding matrix, kG , can play a role in projecting the received signal onto signal subspace and suppressing 
the disturbance easily. Thus, transmission quality can finally be guaranteed. The decoded signal can be 
expressed as

As the PU has different transmission bandwidth with the CU, practically, it is likely to have a different 
sampling rate. The PU may as well sample at different spectral points from that of the CU.  Therefore, to 
analyze the interference from the CU to the PU, not only the integer subcarriers of the CU needs to be 
examinated. The spectrum between the subcarriers of CU needs to be scrutinized as well. To do so, we 
up-sample the interference to each antenna )(m

interference be )(~ m

V. 結果與討論 
A. Single Primary User and Single Cognitive User 
The cases of PU structure with Mp = 4 is simulated. The simulation of interference power 
spectrum at the PU is shown as in Fig.3. We observe that the AIA creates a notch within the 
victim band. The depth of the notch is at about -220dB. As a result, the interference has been 
eliminated by the designed signal from the active antenna of the cognitive user. Even losing one 
of the antennas, the other three antennas of cognitive user may still transmit their own data over 
both the victim band and the non-victim band.

B. Signal Detection of Cognitive Receiver  
In the AIA scheme, the cognitive receiver needs to deal with two source of interference. One is the 
co-channel interference from the primary user, and the other is spatial interference from its own 
active antenna.  The active antenna  may introduce a serious interference to the receiver of the 
cognitive user. As described in previous section, the ordered-QR ML detection is developed in the 
cognitive receiver to handle these interferences.  Fig. 6. shows the BER of  the cognitive receiver

二、與會心得 
1. 目前在此領域的前瞻研究主流分析。 
此次 ICC 似乎 Wireless Comm 佔有約 70%的 paper 量，有線網路的 paper 量相對較少。在傳
統的調變/解調技術、編碼理論之外，MIMO 技術、合作式通訊與轉接式(relay)通道等都是相當
熱門且廣為大家所熱烈討論的課題，總的來說，最熱門的字眼還是 cooperative and cognitive 
wireless communications。另外有一些正在發展的題目我覺得非常有趣，像是 interference alignment、
wireless network coding、wireless security/secrecy 等，在於星期二的 Plenary 香港中文大學的 Prof. 
Raymond Yeung 特別對 wireless network coding 作一個 overview 的 presentation，並認為 wireless 
network coding 會是未來無線通訊技術的主流，會重新塑造無線通訊架構，產生革命性的變革。
總之，藉由本次會議觀摩學習，與發表的作者或單位作最直接的討論，有助於雙方的技術交流。 
 
2. 與國外學者的互動。 
除了台灣去參加會議的相關領域的學者, 會議期間也遇到許多國際上相關領域的友人, 包括
Prof. Qing Zhao (UC Davis, USA), Prof. Moe Win (MIT, USA), Prof. Jack Winters (USA), Prof. 
Meixia Tao (China),…等, Prof. Win 是我 USC 時的研究所同學, 現在已經是 MIT 教授, 國際知名
學者了。會議期間同時也新認識一些國際上相關領域的學者, 包括 Prof. Laurent Ros (France), 
Prof. Jianxian Wu (USA), Kyoung-Jae Lee (李光馥, Korea Univ., Korea) ,…等。 
 
3. 擬定研究計畫。 
      從去年我開始注意到 game theory 是個相當有趣的數學工具，很適合用在像 cognitive radio 
這種有多個 users (or players)的問題上，這次 ICC 也注意到有許多 papers 運用 game theory 在不
同的題目上面，未來應可好好規劃。

In this project, we have developed cognitive radio technologies in three aspects: (1) single cognitive 
user transmit beamforming, (2) single cognitive user receive beamforming, and (3) multiple user joint 
optimization of transmit and receive beamforming. These three research results are accepted in IEEE 
Trans. on Vehicular Technologies, presented IEEE ICC 2010, IEEE APWCS 2010, and submitted to ICC 
2011, respectively.  
As to single cognitive user transmit beamforming, we present a novel scheme that aligns the 
interference from the antennas of the cognitive user (CU) such that the interference to the primary user 
(PU) is nullified or minimized. The two-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) interference channel 
is considered. We assume that the transmission bandwidth of the CU is wider than that of the PU, and the 
spectrum of the PU is called victim band. Because of the unequal transmission bandwidth, the sampling 
rates of the two users are not necessarily equal. Two sources of interferences are considered in the 
alignment. One source is the spatial interference from different antennas of the CU. The other source is 
the inter-carrier interference (ICI) from the in-victim band of CU to the victim band of PU. An active 
antenna of the cognitive user is used to align with the spatial interference from the antennas of the 
cognitive user and ICI such that the interference to the PU is nullified. The simulation shows that the 
scheme created a >100dB notch on the transmission spectrum of the victim band. This scheme allows the 
CU to utilize the victim band simultaneously with the PU and leads to underlay cognitive radio 
transmission. We also present a soft successive interference cancellation at the receiver of the CU to 
detect the signal within the victim band. The error performance at the cognitive receiver of this underlay 
cognitive radio system is presented as well. 
    As to single cognitive user receiving beamforming, the two-user multiple-input multiple-output 
(MIMO) interference channel is considered. We present a MIMO receiving beamforming scheme of the 
cognitive user (CU) to avoid narrowband interference(NBI) from the primary user (PU). The CU seeks 
the opportunity of transmission over the victim band simultaneously with the PU. The transmission error 
performance of the CU is optimized with the constraint of minimized narrowband interference to the PU 
in the victim band. The compromise between the CU transmission performance and the producing 
narrowband interference is also analyzed. The BER and capacity trade-off are illustrated. 
   As to multiple user joint optimization of transmit and receive beamforming, we aim to design a set of 
linear precoding matrices and the corresponding decoding matrices via maximizing the sum capacity to 
achieve the maximal degrees of freedom (DoF) on K-user MIMO interference channel. The existing 
iterative interference alignment (IIA) algorithms provided a suboptimal solution to maximum the sum 
capacity, which minimize the interference caused by others. While the IIA has attracted much attention in 
recent years, joint consideration of sum capacity and distribution of DoF is less address. Besides, the 
achievable DoF has been still an open issue for K-user MIMO interference channels. In this paper, an IIA 
algorithm is presented for joint DoF and sum capacity optimization. The number of data streams for each 
user is optimized and power allocation is also considered. Simulation results are compared to existing IIA 
schemes and show that the proposed algorithm outperforms in terms of sum capacity.

I. 前言 
Nowadays, radio electromagnetic spectrum has become a very precious naturalistic resource in 
wireless communication. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the united States and its 
counterparts around the world allocate a wide range of radio spectrum with varying channel bandwidth. 
However, since wireless services have begun proliferating, there is little radio frequency spectrum left 
over [1]. The chances of two different wireless systems colliding with each other somewhere for some 
time have increased[2]. For example, in the ultra-wide band (UWB) technique, the FCC allocated band 
for unlicensed devices or users who want to access the UWB[3]. However, a narrowband of the spectrum 
may have been used by other primary users, for instance, the IEEE 802.16e(or WiMAX) system. A 
promising solution for this problem is the cognitive radio (CR) technology with Detect and Avoidance 
(DAA) capability [3][4]. DAA initial detects the narrowband interference (NBI) from the primary user 
and then shapes its transmitting power spectrum to avoid NBI with the primary user. 
In a K-user MIMO interference channel, each user tries to communicate between the transmitter and 
the receiver. The transmitter encodes the data stream and makes an effort to resist the interference from 
other users. The performance of a K-user MIMO interference system is measured by the sum capacity. 
Each receiver in IA may divide the received space into signal subspace and interference subspace. It aims 
to design precoders and decoders that align signal to signal subspace and interference to another as 
possible. By projecting the received signal into signal subspace and removing the interference, the 
transmit performance of sum capacity is then enhanced. 
 
II. 研究目的 
The cognitive radio has been advocated to develop dynamic spectrum access technologies and to 
achieve the goal of opportunistic spectrum sharing in a prioritized multi-user communication network. 
The fundamental requirements of cognitive radio users are (1) to perform spectrum sensing to detect the 
presence of the primary users, and (2) to avoid transmission of interference to the primary users. Most 
research literatures focus on overlay cognitive radio that the cognitive users are not allowed to share the 
spectrum with the primary users. The cognitive user adopts DAA strategy to ensure exclusive usage of 
spectrum with the primary users. However, from the information theory and signal processing 
perspectives, it is possible to explore the degrees of freedom or physical resources left available from 
primary users and share the spectrum simultaneously. In this project, we are specifically interested in 
devising the most appropriate form of concurrent communications of cognitive users with constraints of 
limited or null interference to the primary users which is also called underlay cognitive radio[6][7]. 
As to single cognitive user transmit beamforming, we assume a cognitive user with a MIMO OFDM 
system operating in a wide spectrum. The primary user operates at a narrower channel bandwidth in 
overlap with the cognitive user. Therefore, with the two services trying to function simultaneously, the 
narrowband of the primary user becomes a victim band. The conventional CR approach would require the 
cognitive user to provide DAA capability so that the second user operation would not interfere with the 
primary user at the expense of using this victim band. In this paper, we seek the possibility that the 
cognitive user could still utilize the victim band for its data transmission, with the condition that the 
cognitive user does not interfere with the primary users operation. This shows that the power spectrum is 
still below the sensitivity level of the primary user. The receiver of the cognitive user employs MIMO 
 6
 
The channel transfer matrix from transmitter j∈{1,2} to receiver i∈{1,2} is denoted Hi,j, where the 
entries of Hi,j are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) complex Gaussian circularly symmetric 
random variables. The PU is indexed as user 1 and the CU is indexed as user 2. Therefore, with all the Nc 
subcarriers in the OFDM, the channel matrix between the cognitive transmitter and the cognitive receiver 
is represented as H22∈ (Mrc× Nc)
 
×  (Mtc× Nc)
. The kth row and the lth column entry in H22(k, l) is an Mrc×
Mtc sub-matrix representing the intercarrier interference from subcarrier l to subcarrier k, if k ≠ l. H22(k, l) 
also represents the Mrc× Mtc MIMO channel matrix for subcarrier k, if l = k.  
The interference channel from the cognitive transmitter and the primary user is H12∈  (Mp× Nc) ×  
(Mtc× Nc)
. The interference channel from the primary user to the cognitive transmitter is H21∈  (Mtc× Nc) ×
(Mp× Nc)
. The channel matrices are assumed to be stationary over the transmission period and all the 
channel state information (CSI) are available to the cognitive user. We assume that the transmission 
bandwidth of the CU is wider than that of the PU. The narrower spectrum of the PU is called victim 
band, which spans over v subcarriers in the CU. 
• System Model of Multiple Users  
This paper considers the scenario of K-user MIMO interference channel as Fig. 1. The kth transmitter and 
receiver are equipped with 
,t kN  and ,r kN  antennas respectively. We assume the k
th
 transmitter tries to send 
data toward its corresponding receiver by passing through the communicating link, 
,k kH . However, the 
receiver might face interference from other users through interfering link, 
,
, k lH l k∀ ≠ . Then the received 
signal at receiver k can be characterized as follow:

where { }1, ,k K∈ …  is the user index, ky  is the , 1r kN ×  received signal vector of the kth receiver, ks  is 
the 
,
1s kN ×  information vector which transmitter k wishes to send to its receiver, kW  is the , ,t k s kN N×  
precoding matrix with comprising of 
,s kN  linear independent beamforming vectors, and kn  is , 1r kN ×
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) vector at the kth receiver. We assume all noise terms are i.i.d. zero 
mean complex Gaussian with variance, 2Nσ . Input power constraint 
H H
k k k k kP  =  E s W W s  is imposed on 
each user, where ( )H⋅  denotes Hermitian transpose. We consider quasi-static flat fading channel and perfect 
knowledge of all channel coefficients is available to all transmitters and receivers. 
The main idea of interference alignment is to re-plan of the usage of received space by designing the 
precoding matrices { } 1Kk k =W  and decoding matrices { } 1Kk k =G  at transmitter and receiver respectively for 
each user. In particular, transmitter k transmitted 
,s kN  streams coded by precoding matrix, kW , which 
spans the signal subspace of ,r kNℂ  at receiver k and constructs interference subspace at other receivers. 
Further, at each receiver, we desire the interference subspace is orthogonal to the signal space. In other 
words, we are dying to align the signal to the 
,s kN  numbers of linear basis of ,r k
N
ℂ  as signal space and 
place the interference to the remaining 
, ,r k s kN N−  of linear basis of ,r k
N
ℂ  as interference space. Then 
decoding matrix, kG , can play a role in projecting the received signal onto signal subspace and suppressing 
the disturbance easily. Thus, transmission quality can finally be guaranteed. The decoded signal can be 
expressed as

As the PU has different transmission bandwidth with the CU, practically, it is likely to have a different 
sampling rate. The PU may as well sample at different spectral points from that of the CU.  Therefore, to 
analyze the interference from the CU to the PU, not only the integer subcarriers of the CU needs to be 
examinated. The spectrum between the subcarriers of CU needs to be scrutinized as well. To do so, we 
up-sample the interference to each antenna )(m

interference be )(~ m

V. 結果與討論 
A. Single Primary User and Single Cognitive User 
The cases of PU structure with Mp = 4 is simulated. The simulation of interference power 
spectrum at the PU is shown as in Fig.3. We observe that the AIA creates a notch within the 
victim band. The depth of the notch is at about -220dB. As a result, the interference has been 
eliminated by the designed signal from the active antenna of the cognitive user. Even losing one 
of the antennas, the other three antennas of cognitive user may still transmit their own data over 
both the victim band and the non-victim band.

B. Signal Detection of Cognitive Receiver  
In the AIA scheme, the cognitive receiver needs to deal with two source of interference. One is the 
co-channel interference from the primary user, and the other is spatial interference from its own 
active antenna.  The active antenna  may introduce a serious interference to the receiver of the 
cognitive user. As described in previous section, the ordered-QR ML detection is developed in the 
cognitive receiver to handle these interferences.  Fig. 6. shows the BER of  the cognitive receiver

二、與會心得 
1. 目前在此領域的前瞻研究主流分析。 
此次 ICC 似乎 Wireless Comm 佔有約 70%的 paper 量，有線網路的 paper 量相對較少。在傳
統的調變/解調技術、編碼理論之外，MIMO 技術、合作式通訊與轉接式(relay)通道等都是相當
熱門且廣為大家所熱烈討論的課題，總的來說，最熱門的字眼還是 cooperative and cognitive 
wireless communications。另外有一些正在發展的題目我覺得非常有趣，像是 interference alignment、
wireless network coding、wireless security/secrecy 等，在於星期二的 Plenary 香港中文大學的 Prof. 
Raymond Yeung 特別對 wireless network coding 作一個 overview 的 presentation，並認為 wireless 
network coding 會是未來無線通訊技術的主流，會重新塑造無線通訊架構，產生革命性的變革。
總之，藉由本次會議觀摩學習，與發表的作者或單位作最直接的討論，有助於雙方的技術交流。 
 
2. 與國外學者的互動。 
除了台灣去參加會議的相關領域的學者, 會議期間也遇到許多國際上相關領域的友人, 包括
Prof. Qing Zhao (UC Davis, USA), Prof. Moe Win (MIT, USA), Prof. Jack Winters (USA), Prof. 
Meixia Tao (China),…等, Prof. Win 是我 USC 時的研究所同學, 現在已經是 MIT 教授, 國際知名
學者了。會議期間同時也新認識一些國際上相關領域的學者, 包括 Prof. Laurent Ros (France), 
Prof. Jianxian Wu (USA), Kyoung-Jae Lee (李光馥, Korea Univ., Korea) ,…等。 
 
3. 擬定研究計畫。 
      從去年我開始注意到 game theory 是個相當有趣的數學工具，很適合用在像 cognitive radio
