Abstract 
 
 
Assessing liquefaction potential at places where earthquake happens frequently is necessary.  
Since the main problem of mapping liquefaction potential in an extensive area is its limited data 
compared with the mass of study area, interpolation and extrapolation of data is unavoidable.  Thus, 
how to obtain reasonable parameter and model used is important.  That task is performed by 
applying random field concept to obtain the spatial correlation function of soil properties interested 
and hence the data with mean value with variation at unsampled locations can be estimated utilizing 
conditional Gaussian updating.  Therefore, the result of mapping liquefaction potential from 
interpolating or extrapolating data becomes more reasonable by applying the random field concept.  
This research demonstrates the proposed method for assessing liquefaction potential over an 
extensive area using random field concept and Monte Carlo simulation for probabilistic analyses.  A 
reliability index is proposed for denoting the liquefaction potential at a certain location.  The 
feasibility of this proposed method is verified.    The results show that the simulated results are 
comparable to the observed liquefaction phenomena and the scale of fluctuation of soil property 
strongly influences the results of liquefaction potential.  
 Since the key of obtain more reasonable mapping result of liquefaction potential is to 
estimate spatial correlation function of soil properties interested, spatial correlation function at the 
study area, Yuanlin, were particularly studied.  Data including cone tip resistance and sleeve friction 
obtained from 71 cone penetration tests were used and both vertical and horizontal spatial correlation 
structures are estimated by using autocorrelation based method.  Since the correlation distance is 
believed to be significantly affected by complicated processes when soil deposits were formed, the 
horizontal correlation distances of two orthogonal directions in three divided study subregions are 
particularly studied and discussed.  The result shows the correlation distance of each subregion are 
strongly correlated to the geological condition.  Therefore, zonation was necessary for estimating the 
spatial structure especially for horizontal direction.  In addition, the anisotropy of spatial structure is 
also dominated by the geological environment.  Moreover, the bias of the result using autocorrelation 
based method to estimate irregular sampling spacing cases were also studied because regular 
sampling spacing of data is often unavailable.  It indicates the bias is larger for qc as interval 
increases and almost no influence to fs data. 
 Furthermore, another factor that was found to possibly affect the result of liquefaction

Yuanlin area.  In the years after the Chi-Chi earthquake, the National Center for Research on 
Earthquake Engineering (NCREE) in Taiwan conducted field tests (cone penetration test and 
standard penetration test) and built liquefaction potential maps of each county to provide a medium 
to express the spatial distribution of liquefaction risk of an area.  The liquefaction potential denoted 
by contours or by microzonations is conventionally used to build the map.  There are three steps to 
carry out liquefaction potential mapping described as follows: (1) use simplified procedures to 
evaluate the factor of safety at which the field tests are conducted; (2) calculate the liquefaction 
index or potential of each penetration location; and (3) use ready-made software, such as ArcView, 
Surfer, or others, to build the contour according to the calculated liquefaction index at the sampled 
locations.  Though many researchers use diverse methods in assessing liquefaction potential (Tso et 
al. 2002; Chao et al. 2002; Hsu et al. 2002; Chen and Chung 2002; Chien et al. 2002; Ger et al. 2002; 
Chen et al. 2002c) or in microzoning study area (Delgado et al. 1998; Ansary and Rashid 2000; Chen 
et al. 2002a; Chen et al. 2002b; Brabhaharan and Thrush 2003), they are similar in focusing only on 
locations where the field test data are available, and in using handy interpolation software to build 
maps.  Prior studies have not devoted to the assessment of liquefaction potential at locations where 
no in-situ tests are conducted.  The estimation of liquefaction potential where no field test data are 
available is the key to building an accurate map of liquefaction potential.  The rationale behind the 
usage of the interpolation or extrapolation techniques has never been seriously discussed. 
To estimate the liquefaction potential over an extensive area, the information of mean value 
and standard deviation, which provide the most possible value of a variable and its variation is not 
sufficient.  Random field considers the spatial variability of the soil properties thus providing more 
information than just using mean and variance (DeGroot 1996; Lacasse and Nadim 1996).  This 
information can be further used in an interpolation technique to estimate/update data at unsampled 
locations (Vanmarcke 1984).  The objective of this research is to demonstrate a random field-based 
methodology for preparing the liquefaction potential map corresponding to the liquefaction potential 
at both sampled and unsampled locations.  In this research, cone tip resistance, sleeve friction, and 
ground water table are treated as random fields.  The values of these properties over the study area 
are estimated using the updating technique.  The details of evaluating the spatial structures of the soil 
properties, assessing the liquefaction potential, mapping the study area, and relevant discussions are 
presented in the following sections.   
As previously discussed, in the process that soil deposits formed, soils from various sources 
with different materials are partially or completely mixed up by natural force and hence the influence

2. THE GOAL OF RESEARCH 
Throughout this study, the emphasis was put on more reasonably assessing liquefaction 
potential over and extensive area and optimizing one dimensional explore program.  Therefore, the 
spatial structure of properties interested at the study site was particularly studied and the goal of this 
research attempted to (a) develop a method for mapping liquefaction potential over extensive area, (b) 
characterize the spatial structure at a liquefaction site, and (c) optimize one dimensional exploring 
programming.   
 
3. SITE DESCRIPTION 
The town of Yuanlin located approximately 30 kilometers west of the epicenter of the Chi-chi 
earthquake is with a dimension of about 5 by 5 km2 and suffered severe damage of soil liquefaction 
during the earthquake.  The geological map is shown in Fig. 1.  It is on a thick alluvial deposit of 
Jhuoshuei River at the foothill of Baguashan in the east.  The alluvial plain of Yuanlin is relatively 
flat and slightly tilting from south down to north with a difference in elevation of 10 m.  
Groundwater table at this area was shallow ranging from about 0.5 to 4 m.  In 1992, Water Resources 
Agency of Ministry of Economic Affairs funded the Groundwater Monitoring Network project.  A 
200-meter-deep observation well was conducted in 1994 in Yuanlin.  It showed that the main soil 
above 20 meter depth is the mud.  According to the MAA’s investigation (2000) of conducting 50 
exploration borings and 45 CPTs, however, silty sand, sandy silt, and silty clay are the main soil 
layers inter-bedded above the depth of 50 m.  In general, there are layers of loose sandy soils that are 
susceptible to liquefaction according to the CPT based classification result.  Also, a thick layer of 
clayey soils (sandwiched with few thin silt mixtures and sand mixtures’ layers) exists at the western 
part of Yuanlin that becomes thinner towards the eastern side of the town.  At some locations, 
however, sand deposits exist near the ground surface with little or no capping clayey layer.

earthquake input to calculate CSR.  The rd and amax are treated as random variables in this analysis.  
The overburden stresses are calculated using γ and ground water table (GWT) data.  The unit weight 
of soil (γ) and GWT were collected from 49 SPT sites.  The cone tip resistance (qc) and sleeve 
friction (fs) profiles of 71 cone penetrations were used to evaluate the mean value and standard 
deviation of these parameters at each depth.  A few zero and negative readings of intermediate depth 
of qc and fs profiles were obviously erroneous.  The data was corrected according to the criteria 
suggested by Fenton (1999).   
 The illustrations of mesh, grids and elements of the study area are shown in Fig. 3.  The size 
of grids is obtained according to the resolution of the potential map and computing time.  The study 
area is meshed into 15596 grids for liquefaction potential analysis.  The dimension of each grid is 40 
m (length) × 40 m (width) × 20 m (depth).  Since the CPT is recorded every 0.05 meters, the 
thickness of an element is set to be 0.05 meters, thus there are 400 soil elements in one grid. 
 
4.1.1.2 Data Analysis 
Data analysis deals with the statistical characteristics of parameters in the model.  The 
uncertainty in the CPT-based simplified procedure is accounted for by considering the variability of 
parameters in both demand (CSR) and capacity (CRR).  The attributes and statistical properties of 
these design parameters are listed in Table 1.  Natural characteristics can account for the attribute of 
each parameter, which have been discussed in previous liquefaction potential studies (Fenton 1999; 
Lacasse and Nadim 1996; Popescu 1995; Popescu et al. 1996; Popescu et al. 1997; Haldar and Tang 
1979), as shown in Table 2.  It is assumed that the soil is isotropic, homogeneous in horizontal 
direction at the same depth within an element.   
In CRR part, γ and GWT, qc and fs are treated as random variables.  According to the Central 
Limit Theorem, γ and GWT are assumed to be normally distributed.  The mean value of γ at each 
depth from the ground surface to 20 meters beneath the ground is calculated using the SPT data.  In 
general, γ is between 1.92 and 2.06 Mg/m3 (i.e., 18.84 and 20.21 kN/m3).  This profile of γ, which is 
varying with depth, will be input into each element in performing the Monte-Carlo simulation of the 
liquefaction potential.  The variation in γ is small and its mean COV is 0.059.  The range and COV of 
γ are comparable to that summarized by Phoon and Kulhawy (1999) in which γ from collected data 
may vary from 14 kN/cm3 to 20 kN/m3 and COV ranges from 0.01 to 0.20 (Table 2). The GWT data 
were observed from 49 SPTs.  The variation of ground water during a year, which is 0.07, is

relations to estimate the ground acceleration and total standard error.  According to the Taiwan 
Central Geological Survey, surface ruptures were observed along the Chelungpu fault of a north-
south trending thrust fault dipping about 30˚ to the east (Chang et al. 1988; Bonilla 1999).  Values for 
the epicenter are 23.86° N, 120.81° E, and the focal depth is 11 km.  The whole area of Yuanlin is 
located west of the Chelungpu fault footing wall so that F, HW, and S in Abrahamson and Silva’s 
(1997) empirical response spectral attenuation relations are 1, 0, and 1, respectively.  The calculated 
peak ground accelerations over study region are shown in Fig. 5.  According to the Taiwan Central 
Weather Bureau, the peak acceleration of Yuanlin Station (TCU110) located at Yuanlin Elementary 
School was 0.192g.  It is similar to the estimated ground acceleration at the grid of Yuanlin 
Elementary School.  The calculated total standard error for average horizontal and vertical ground 
acceleration is 0.43 and 0.59, respectively.  The estimated peak ground acceleration as modeled in 
developing attenuation relations is also treated as a lognormal distributed random variate in the 
analysis. 
The rd in CSR is also assumed to be a random variable which varies with depth.  The mean 
value of rd follows the approach proposed by Youd et al (2001).  To estimate the standard deviation 
of rd, the three-sigma rule proposed by Dai and Wang (1992) is applied herein.  The rule is basically 
developed from the fact that 99.73% of all values of a normally distributed parameter fall within 
three standard deviations.  By a given or known boundary of the parameter, the standard deviation 
can be estimated as: 
Standard Deviation = (HCV – LCV)/6                                                             (2) 
where HCV is the upper bound of the concerned parameter, rd, known as the highest conceivable 
value, and LCV is the lower bound known as the lowest conceivable value of rd.  This rule is also 
employed in Duncan (2000) to estimate the meaningful standard deviation of a parameter with upper 
and lower bounds.  The HCVs and LCVs are estimated from Seed and Idriss (1971) and Cetin et al. 
(2001), respectively.  The calculated standard deviation varies from 0 at ground surface to 0.123 at 
the depth of 20 meters.  rd is treated as a normal distributed random variate in the analysis to account 
for its influence. 
It is noted that the magnitude scaling factor (MSF) herein was not treated as random variable 
because the moment magnitude of the Chi-Chi earthquake is 7.6, which is very close to 7.5.  For 
other cases when Mw is significantly different from 7.5, the variation can be large and thus must be 
considered.

an appropriate correlation model, expressed by a correlation function ρ(τ ), to describe how data are 
correlated with separation, τ.  In this study, an exponential model is adopted as the correlation 
function to fit data in the considered fitting range.  The exponential model is expressed as: 
 be /||)( ττρ −=  (4) 
For a one-dimensional continuous or discrete parameter stationary random field X(t) with mean m 
and variance σ2, the scale of fluctuation (SOF) of exponential correlation function is equal to 2b that 
expresses how far the interested property is correlated.  Vanmarcke (1984) details the approach to 
estimate the SOF.   
Fig. 6 shows the lag plots of horizontal CPT data at an elevation of 16 m above sea level.  
The SOFs with exponential model at the elevation of qc and fs are determined by means of ordinary 
least square error and they are 163.9 m and 126.9 m, respectively.  The profiles of horizontal SOF of 
qc and fs with exponential model along the depth are shown in Fig. 7.  Generally, these SOFs vary 
from 100 m to 300 m.  Compared with previous studies of the horizontal autocorrelation distance of 
cone tip resistance, listed in Table 3, the estimated autocorrelation distance in this study is much 
larger.  The difference is mainly attributed to the large separation (mostly greater than 100 m) 
between CPT penetration locations in the field as shown in DeGroot and Baecher (1993) that the 
SOF is strongly affected by the sampling interval.  SOF of some geotechnical properties were 
summarized by Phoon and Kulhawy (1999) and it shows that SOF of nature water content is up to 
170 meter.  Furthermore, remarkable differences of spatial structures in the same site were observed 
in Jaksa et al. (1997b) who used the field test data with different investigation scales.  Jaksa and 
Fenton (2002) also pointed out that the geotechnical materials might exhibit different spatial 
variability characteristics depending on the scale of the investigation and the type of problem being 
examined.   
It is noted that the spatial structure is assumed to be isotropic and to be the same at the same 
elevation.  The rationale is that the study region is an alluvial plane whose soil composition and 
deposit history for the same elevation is assumed to be similar.  However, the validity of these 
assumptions becomes questionable for a larger study area.  Though it is a rare engineering practice 
and seldom employed in academic research, different spatial structures for the same elevation or 
anisotropic spatial structures can be estimated on the basis of ample information including field test 
data, soil composition, and deposition history.  The effect of different spatial structure on mapping of 
soil liquefaction will be further discussed in later section.

In this study, this updating technique is employed to evaluate the mean value and variance of 
ln(qc) and ln(fs) data at unsampled locations in horizontal directions.  The prior data (XB) of every 
grid were estimated by interpolating the CPT data over the study region because interpolation is the 
most common approach for mapping.  It is noted that this study applies a more delicate interpolation 
concept.  Different from the conventional approach that evaluates the liquefaction (or factor of safety) 
of CPT penetration locations and then interpolates them, this study interpolates the soil properties of 
CPT and then simulates the potential of each grid.  By combining the prior data and the spatial 
structures (estimated in the preceding section) for every 5 mm in elevation, the conditional mean 
(mA|B) and variance (CAA|B) of every element can be evaluated using Equations (4) to (10).  
 
4.1.1.5 Estimation of GWT over Study Area 
The GWT data were collected from 49 SPT sites.  For grids where SPT were not performed 
the random field concept was employed to estimate the GWT.  The study area was SOF of GWT is 
assumed to be relatively large to include all the SPT data into conditional updating analysis.  That is, 
the GWT at every grid is the gravitational center of all SPT data which are inversely weighted by the 
distance between the grid and SPT boreholes.   
 
4.1.1.6 Simulations 
The mean value and variance of random variables of each element are input into the 
Robertson and Wride (1998) method to evaluate the liquefaction potential using Monte Carlo 
simulation.  Monte Carlo simulation is a useful tool for approximating the probability when the 
analytical results are difficult to obtain.  It repeatedly samples the values from the probability 
distributions for the uncertain variables and then puts them into a model to calculate the 
corresponding outcome.  In this research, simulation of the reliability of each element is 
implemented with the CSR and CRR properties, as shown in Table 1.  The reliability of an element 
(Re) is evaluated as:

geological condition of the Yuanlin area described by Lee et al. (2003) and it is capable of presenting 
details of the liquefaction potential over vertical profile.  Even smaller thicknesses with high 
liquefaction potential can be observed from the profile.  It illustrates the advantage of using CPT data 
to evaluate its liquefaction potential for it and can provide almost continuous records in the vertical 
direction.  Relative to the prior map that evaluates the potential only at which the test data were 
collected, this analysis presents advantage in providing liquefaction potential of each grid.  The 
updated liquefaction potential of the cross-section at Yuanlin is shown in Fig. 8(b).  The introduction 
of random field concept updates the prior distribution of liquefaction potential.  For elements within 
the correlation distance of any conducted CPT, their prior data are updated by qc and fs measurements 
of that CPT.  The updated profiles are more complicated than prior profiles.    
The maps built using prior and updated data are shown in Fig. 9 for comparison.  The prior 
result shows that the reliability is generally about 0.5 but higher in the southern part of the studied 
area and the eastern wedge of Yuanlin where the elevation increases.  The updated result shows that 
some clusters of higher liquefaction potential (i.e., lower reliability) are located in the eastern part of 
the studied area.  This is comparable to the location and shape of the observed liquefaction 
phenomena after the Chi-Chi Earthquake (Fig. 2).  There are some clusters of higher liquefaction 
potential located in the northern and southwestern parts of the alluvial plain.  It is not consistent with 
the field observation.  This inconsistency is mainly attributed to the CPTs conducted in these 
locations.  As shown in Fig. 8, the CPTs denoted as C5, Y12, and Y13 indicate soil profiles of high 
liquefaction potential even though no liquefaction phenomena was observed.  It is noted that many 
studies have shown the effect of capping clay layers on the surface manifestation in this area.  No 
evidence of surface liquefaction did not necessarily exclude the possibility of liquefaction. 
To compare quantitatively the simulated liquefaction potential, an index parameter D is 
introduced.  D is defined as the total least square of the difference between the simulated liquefaction 
potential and the observed liquefaction phenomena (Fig. 2) given by:

were obtained or where the field tests were conducted because the complex formation process of soil.   
Even though they were from adjacent positions in relatively homogeneous soil mass, identical results 
were always not obtained.  However, for any soil property obtained from adjacent positions within a 
certain distance, the more similar results may be obtained comparing with those obtained from 
distant positions.  This characteristic of spatial variability of soils can be estimated by using 
autocorrelation or autocovariance based method and can be accounted for by its spatial structures, 
which is often, not only site specific but location and direction specific.  For study sites with similar 
soils or formation process of soils, the spatial structure may be similar (Fenton 1999).   
 
4.2.1 Effect of Sampling Spacing 
Present method utilized to estimate autocorrelation requires equal spacing.  However, among 
several in-situ tests, only data in vertical direction from CPT is with equal spacing.   To date, 
standard penetration test (SPT) and cone penetration test (CPT) are two in-situ tests commonly used.  
Others such as vane shear test (VST), dilatometer test (DMT) and/or pressuremeter test (PMT) were 
also used.  Although vertical sampling spacing from CPT is equal, this is not always true for the 
others.  Besides, equal horizontal sampling spacing is always unavailable in engineering practice and 
location selected to conduct field test is based on engineer’s judgment.  Therefore, estimation of 
spatial structure of soil property with autocorrelation may encounter some problem.  Data of qc and fs 
with equal spacing of 0.05 m is provided from 71 CPTs at Yuanlin herein.  With that small spacing, 
the study of effect of sampling spacing becomes being feasible and cases of different sampling 
spacing were studied.  Collected data were treated by deleting data for study purpose.  CPT data of 
shallow depths less than 1 m were deleted because data near ground surface were disturbed.  
Moreover, some zero or negative readings in profiles were shifted by interpolating from closest non-
zero data.  This is believed to be reasonable and feasible as suggested by Fenton (1999).  It is noted 
that Ku et al. (2004) compared the CPT data conducted at different times.  It shows that the obtained 
results from Nov. 1999, July 2000, and May 2005 are similar.  Therefore, time effect to the CPT data 
used herein is small enough to be neglected.  
 
4.2.1.1 Ideal Even Sampling Spacing 
Self-similar behavior may exist at many scales (DeGroot and Baecher 1993; Jaksa et al. 
1997a; Fenton 1999; Jaksa and Fenton 2002).  That is, spatial correlation of soil properties may be 
present in various sampling interval.  Collected data was used to study their self-similar behavior in 
 18
curve is less smooth with increasing spacing.  For those cases, it is suggested that triangular 
correlation model to be used. 
Mean value of qc and fs ranges 0.77-1.87 m and 0.36-0.97 m (Table 5), respectively. Starting 
from sampling spacing of 1.5 m, they are more significantly decreasing with increasing sampling 
spacing due to more SOFs not being present and the SOF is nearly zero.  It also indicates coefficient 
of variation increases with increasing sampling spacing.  The reason is that for larger sampling 
spacing, SOFs tend to be larger and smaller and even not exist.  Thus, the variation of SOF increases 
with increasing sampling spacing.   
 
4.2.1.2 Effect of Fitting Range 
The fitting range is the considered distance to the lag at zero in model fitting.  Jaksa (2000) 
mentioned that autocorrelation function in the standard practice in time series analysis and 
geostatistics is plotted to one-quarter of the total depth of measurements because beyond that 
distance the number of pairs contributing to the result is few and the values are unreliable.  However, 
Lacasse and Nadim (1996) illustrated that spatial correlation is no more present as autocorrelation 
decreases to be less than zero.  Thus, it is desired to understand the effect of fitting range adopted in 
curve fitting.  This study considers four cases with different fitting range in each case.  The estimated 
vertical scale of fluctuation (SOF) of 71 CPT-qc and -fs profiles considering different fitting ranges is 
shown in Fig. 14 in which the legend, fraction a/b, denotes that the considered fitting range is a/b 
times total lag in lag plot; and “GT0” denotes that the considered fitting range is only the part in lag 
plot with autocorrelation greater or equal to zero.   
SOF1/1 and SOF1/2 shows no difference for all profiles for the result of both qc and fs data.  
That is, the same result will be obtained using total or half of the measurement length in lag plot.  For 
result from qc data considering 1/4 of total lag plot was used, SOF in 5 out of 71 profiles increased 
more than 5% of the SOF considering total lags.  For the result of fs data with 1/4 of total lag plot 
considered, no profiles increased more than 5% of SOF1/1’s result.  Therefore the adopted fitting 
range may only slightly affect the estimated scale of fluctuation and similar result would be obtained 
using total, one-fourth, and one-half of the measurement length. However, significant change in 
SOFs for most profiles was found in GT0 case in which larger scale of fluctuation is obtained.  The 
result also indicates that SOF of cone tip resistance is more affected by using different fitting range 
than that of sleeve friction, which is not significantly affected by different fitting range, especially for 
GT0 cases.

shown in Table 6.  Comparison was made between even and uneven spacing cases as shown in Fig. 
17 and Fig. 18.  The mean values and the range of all CPT profiles for qc and fs at each sampling 
spacing is shown in Fig. 17 and their coefficient of variation is shown in Fig. 18.  SOFs of uneven 
spacing cases increase until an average sampling spacing of 0.26 (i.e., threshold of 0.8) is also shown 
in Fig. 17 as previous discussed.  The range of SOFs is similar for most spacing except for larger 
sampling spacing for qc.  Moreover, the mean value of SOFs of uneven spacing cases of qc are also 
smaller.  The COV of qc of uneven spacing cases are much larger for bigger average sampling 
spacing than that of even sampling spacing (Fig. 18).  For fs, it is about the same in all cases.  
Therefore, it is concluded that the SOF of qc for larger average uneven sampling spacing (1.5-
2.5 m) may be underestimated.  However, SOFs of fs are almost the same (for sampling from 0.5-
2.5m).  With increasing sampling spacing for qc data, estimated SOF using uneven sampling data 
may change more than that from even spacing data at higher sampling spacing.  However, SOF for fs 
changes about the same even though uneven sampling spacing data are used. 
 
4.2.2 Spatial Structure of CPT Data Yuanlin 
4.2.2.1 Zonation 
A great number of liquefaction phenomena such as sand boiling and ground settlement were 
observed at Yuanlin after the Chi-chi Earthquake.  Most liquefaction phenomena clustered in the 
middle-eastern parts of Yuanlin.  Some were observed in the west-southern and middle-northern part.  
That irregular distribution resulted from the discrepancy of soil strata and the distance to epicenter of 
earthquake.  The former is mainly caused by soil formation process.  Yuanlin is a big place with soil 
strata beneath the ground formed by soils from various sources and different formation processes that 
may result in different horizontal spatial correlation structure and soil conditions.  The purpose of 
zonation at Yuanlin is to separate different soil conditions attempting to better describe the spatial 
variability at this the liquefaction site. 
Zonation was conducted utilizing the evidence from CPT data.  Adjacent pair of CPT profiles 
(raw data) was compared (both qc and fs were used) and comparison result was classified as one of 
the three levels, very similar, similar, and dissimilar.  This is an eye-measuring process by determine 
the percentage of similarity of any adjacent two pair of CPT profiles.  Result of qc agree with that of 
fs.  The same process was also applied to CPT based soil classification (Robertson 1990) profiles and 
result was correspondent with that using raw data.  SPT data such as profiles of SPT-N value, fine 
content (FC), clay content (CC) (where FC is the percentage passing sieve No. 200 and CC is the 
 22
region are mixed of clays, silt mixtures, and sand mixtures.  The SW region is an alluvial plain 
characterized by soils flowed from the some tributaries coming down from Baguashan.  And eastern 
NW region may be the downstream of tributaries from Baguashan and hence the sand layer is much 
smaller and mix-bedded with clays, silt mixtures and sand mixtures.  This zonation result is generally 
correspondent with result from the zonation result using SPT data.  Because soil formed from similar 
process in the same environment is believed to have similar soil profile, this zonation result is 
reasonable.  
 
4.2.2.2 Estimation of Vertical Spatial Structure  
Statistical data at each subdivision are summarized in Table 7.  For qc, on average, qcSOF1/4 
is much larger in SW region (2.53 m) than in NW region (1.80 m) and EAST region (1.72 m) area.  
This is reasonable because in EAST region there is a river flowing from south to north (Fig. 1) that 
converges with several perpendicular tributary streams forming distinguishing two layers of sand 
deposit and other soils such as clays, slit mixtures and sand mixtures.  Mixing too many different 
kinds of soil type may lead to less spatial correlation.  Thus, EAST region has smallest vertical SOF 
averagely.   
NW has some CPTs locates near the border of NW and EAST region that are believed being 
the downstream of tributaries from Baguashan (Fig 12) and are mix-bedded with clays, silt mixtures 
and sand mixtures, as explained in previous section.  That may cause small SOF and hence average 
vertical SOF of that region is smaller compared with SW region, which was more steadily deposited 
by soil.  Therefore, SW region has the biggest vertical SOF on average.  For fs, on average, all 
regions have similar SOF.  
 
4.2.2.3 Estimation of Horizontal Spatial Structure 
Horizontal data with equal sampling-spacing is not common in engineering practice, mostly 
for research purpose only.  Data provided in previous studies were vertical ones more than horizontal 
ones.  DeGroot (1996) indicated that the horizontal SOF is approximately one order of vertical SOF.  
However, summarized data shown in Phoon and Kulhawy (1999) indicates that the horizontal scale 
of fluctuation of qc (with a range of 3.0-80 m for sand and clay) can be much more than one order of 
magnitude larger than the vertical scale of fluctuation.  The nature water content of soil is up to 170 
meters.  Jaksa (1995) and Jaksa et al. (1997b) indicated a larger horizontal correlation distance up to 
300 m.  Since scale of fluctuation is influenced by the sampling interval (DeGroot and Baecher 1993;

4.3 THE OPTIMUM ONE DIMENSIONAL EXPLORING PROGRAMMING  
 
Probabilistic method has been widely applied to geotechnical engineering to estimate the 
uncertainty contained in geotechnical engineering system in the past decade.  The uncertainty 
reduction rate of different sampling number was studied herein by combining Bayesian 
methodology, total probability theorem, and Monte Carlo simulation, as introduced in the following: 
 
4.3.1 Bayesian Methodology 
Bayesian methodology (And and Tang, 1975) that combines subjective (inferred) and 
objective (sampling) information was successfully applied to solving seepage flow problem 
(Hachich and Vanmarcke, 1983), groundwater problem (Freeze et al. 1990), and so forth.  The 
objective information was used to update the subjective information, which always comes from 
engineering judgments.  With increasing objective information obtained, the updated data of interest 
are closer to the real site condition.   In-situ property can be obtained from lab tests and in-situ tests 
as well.  In addition, engineers can refer to the geological information of the study site and 
engineering judgments can be used to estimate the parameter of interest.  Wu et al. (1996) 
established a geological model based on the collected geological data to characterize the site 
condition.  The geological model was further turned into probabilistic model using data provided in 
the collected geological data.  Bayesian updating technique was then used to combine the 
geological model and engineering judgment and obtained the soil strata distribution underground.   
Kinnicutt and Einstein (1996) combines statistical method, Kriging, and Bayesian approach to 
access the soil strata distribution and corresponding uncertainty contained in the result.   NOMAD 
was used therein to illustrate the 3-D geological condition and provided a media for characterizing 
in-situ soil strata. 
4.3.2 Monte Carlo Simulation 
 Simulation is a procedure that transformed an assumed model to real events (Ang & Tang, 
1975).  That can be carried out by theoretical simulation or experiment.  The former is the computer-
aided numerical simulation.  The main idea of Monte Carlo simulation is to randomly repeat a 
 26
for an unknown site.  Normal distribution of the parameters, location and width of the anomaly, 
was adopted.  The effect of the parameters to the reduction rate of uncertainty will be studied.  
The number of realization is determined by comparing the number of realization of parameters, 
central location and width.  Fig. 23 shows that uncertainty tends to stabile when the number of 
realization is greater than 400.  Thus, 500 realization is adopted in there study. 
b. Calculate and list the probability of all possible events. 
Every boring (sampling) can “detect” or “not detect” the anomaly.  Thus, a case with N 
borings can have 2N events.  However, it is reduced to ∑
=
+
N
i
i

1  events due to the assumption 
that there is only one continuous anomaly in the study site.  Since the maximum size of the 
anomaly is equal to the width of study site, the boundary of anomaly is xpxp LxLx 2

1 −−  
when the boring location is located at xp and the width of the anomaly is Lx.  As illustrated in 
Fig. 24, xp, xp Lx 2
1+ , and xp Lx 2
1−  forms a trihedral prism, in which the likelihood function is 
equal to 1.  The likelihood outside the trihedral prism is 0.  The probability of each event (i.e., 
the likelihood function of each event) is the volume of the prior distribution of that trihedral 
prism and can be calculated by

in which, )( iEP ε = the probability of each event, ⎥⎦
⎤⎢⎣
⎡=Φ
W
Lc , Lc = central location of anomaly, 
and W = the width of anomaly.  Due to the assumption that the center of the anomaly must be 
located in the study site, but the boundary of the anomaly can excess the study site, the events 
can be separated into two cases: (i) boundary part and (ii) diamond part, as illustrated Fig. 25.  
The difference between above two cases will be detailed in the following section. 
c. Estimate the anomaly’s center location and width according to its prior distribution. 
Every event is described by two variables, the central location and width of anomaly.  
Monte Carlo simulation was applied herein by conduct realization of the two variables based 
on their probabilistic density function.  Since two variables are not independent, realization of 
one of it will influence of the other variable’s realization result.   
Take a six-boring exploration program with 40 units wild for example, the width of 
 28
Hence, the expected value or mean value were commonly used in describing the result.  In 
engineering practice, the probability of an event A cannot be calculated because A is a set of 
exclusive events, that is, A =｛E1,E2,…En｝and the probability of occurrence of event A is 
dependant on the subset of event A, Ei,i=1,2,…n.  Therefore, the total probability of A depends 
on the weight of each event in the subset is expressed as  
 )()(...).1()1()( nEPnEAPEPEAPAP ++=  (17)
where P(Ei) =  the probability of occurrence of event Ei, )EA(P i =the probability of 
occurrence of event Ei given the occurrence of event A.  In this study, the uncertainty is 
defined as the variation of variables.  After combining the Bayesian Theorem and total 
probability theory, the uncertainty of the site is defined as 
 ∑ ΦΦ =

4.3.4 Simulation Result and Discussion 
  In this study, the reduction rate of uncertainty of a one-dimensional site considering the width 
and central location of anomaly as two variables with a prior normal distribution has been studied 
herein.  The setting of the variables has been discussed in the previous section.  The study site is 40 
units wild.  The number of boring (sampling) was 2, 3, …, 10 borings, respectively.  The study was 
conducted under the procedure discuss in the previous section.  The effect of number of borings to 
the reduction rate of uncertainty has been studied herein.  The result is discussed in the following. 
 
 
 30
resulting in the increasing in the probability of occurrence of that boring.  And that boring has 
significant influence contributing total probability.  When the number of boring is even number, no 
boring locates on the center of the mean value of the prior distribution.  With increasing number of 
borings, the spacing between adjacent borings becomes smaller.  Thus, the influence becomes less 
significant with increasing boring number and the curve becomes more smoothly and starts to 
converge.  In general, the uncertainty decreased with increasing number of boring being conducted in 
at site.  
  The standard deviation of prior distribution is one of the influencing factors.  It is normalized 
by the width of the site to conduct the sensitivity analysis.  Fig. 28 shows the uncertainty reduction 
curve of different mean value of prior distribution of the central location (i.e., the variable, Lc).  They 
are 1/10, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2 times of the site width.   With increasing standard deviation, the effect of odd 
and even number of borings is not significant resulting from the probability that only one boring 
detects the anomaly is small while the standard deviation of the prior distribution is small.  However, 
it increases with increasing the standard deviation of the prior distribution and hence the effect is less 
significant.  The variable W has similar result. It is, however, not as significant as Lc. 
  In the study site, the curve of odd or even number or borings against the uncertainty reduction 
are concave down.  Eliminate the case that has significant effect (as shown in Fig. 27).  The curve 
can be regressed and hence described with two straight lines, Lx1 and Lx2, when the number of boring 
is large or small enough, as shown in Figure 29.  The reduction of uncertainty is more significant in 
the range of Lx1.   That 2-section curve implies that the exploration program is not effective when 
only few boring can be conducted.  With increasing number of borings, more information is obtained 
and more budgets are required.  Building the chart of Lx1 and Lx1 helps to conducte an effective 
exploration program for a 1-D site. 
  
 
 
 
 32
more field tests conducted at sites where liquefaction was observed would give a prior prediction of 
higher liquefaction potential, and vice versa.  The soil properties at unsampled locations are updated 
by the CPT data nearby.  Therefore the configuration of penetration locations would influence the 
mapped liquefaction potential distribution.  The optimal site exploration scheme about number and 
configuration of CPTs is important for mapping the liquefaction potential over an extensive region.    
 
5.2 THE ESTIMATION OF SPATIAL CORRELATION STRUCTURES OF CPT DATA IN A 
LIQUEFACTION SITE 
The emphasis was put on the importance of estimating SOF at a big site at which geological 
condition may significantly influence spatial structure of properties.  According to the result, fractal 
behavior (Fenton 1999; Jaksa and Fenton 2002) was found in vertical direction, but not for all 
intervals.  There is no systematic rule to know at what sampling a profile has strong, weak, or no 
spatial correlation.  With increasing sampling spacing, the estimated SOF may change more 
significantly.  Generally, coefficient of variation of SOF for qc of even sampling spacing is more is 
larger than that of uneven sampling spacing.  Fitting range that was thought to influence was 
interested and result indicated that adopting one-fourth, one-half, or all length of measurement would 
not significantly influence the result (i.e., SOF) and the influence to qc is slightly stronger than to fs.  
It is noted that the studied cases for that is small sampling spacing case.  The influence of that might 
stronger for larger sampling spacing.  Further study shall be carried out to understand its effect.   
It was obvious that the irregular distributed liquefaction phenomena observed at Yuanlin is 
mainly due to the geological condition in that area.  Therefore, proper zonation at that big site can 
separate distinguishing geological condition and was firstly performed using CPT and SPT data 
before estimating horizontal spatial structure at each zone for the purpose of providing more 
reasonable estimation result.  Three regions, SW, NW, and EAST region were divided at Yuanlin and 
were corresponding with the geological condition and the river system.  Estimated horizontal SOF 
showed the EAST region (i.e., E1, E2, E3 with SOF of about 500 m) over it a river flows has much 
longer SOF (about 200 m more) along the river direction (N-S direction) than all other SOF in any 
direction in other region.  Case S1 also showed larger SOF (about 100 more) than any others except 
E1, E2, E3.  That implies that the geological condition and history does cause anisotropy to the soil, 
and soil deposits formed by rivers exist longer spatial correlation possibly due to river deposits are 
more homogeneous and better mixing material along a long distance.  It is noted that the estimated 
SOF are much larger than other researchers’ results.  The reason is that the sampling interval is much
