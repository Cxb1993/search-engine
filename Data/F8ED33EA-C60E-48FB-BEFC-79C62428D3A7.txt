time-domain equalization mechanism [3], and single-carrier with frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE)
system [4]. Among these three schemes, SC-FDE system is an attractive proposal since it provides a low
complexity equalization process than time-domain equalization, and it avoids some drawbacks of OFDM
systems, e.g., a high peak-to-average power ratio, and the sensitivity to carrier frequency offsets [4].
To realize the potential advantage of STBC SC-FDE systems, accurate channel state information is
required. Channel can be estimated using training signal which requires additional bandwidth. As a means
to eschewing the need of training signal and the associated bandwidth requirement, blind channel estimation
becomes another alternative [10]. In the existing literature, however, to the best of our knowledge, there
is only one work proposed a blind estimation method for STBC SC-FDE systems [5]. Based on diagonal
precoding, the method [5] exploits the precoding-induced linear signal structure in the conjugate cross
correlation between the two temporal block received signals to yield a block circulant with circulant block
(BCCB) linear system for white channel noise. The products of channel coefficients are then solved by the
BCCB linear system. Finally the channel impulse response vectors are obtained up to a 2×2 matrix ambiguity
by taking eigen-decomposition of a Hermitian matrix formed from the products of channel coefficients.
In this paper, we propose a different diagonal precoding to estimate the channel impulse response vectors
of STBC SC-FDE systems. With the proposed precoding, the relation between the covariance matrices of
the received data and the products of channel coefficients becomes highly structured. The structure makes
it very easy to obtain the products of channel coefficients by using only subtraction and division. Then
each of the two channel impulse response vectors is obtained up to a scalar ambiguity, by computing the
eigenvector associated with the maximal eigenvalue of a Hermitian matrix formed from the corresponding
products of channel coefficients. The proposed framework gaurantees uniquely recovery of all the products
of channel coefficients for colored or white noise case. The impact of the precoding on channel estimation
and equalization is also discussed. In addition, we generalize the proposed method to the MIMO case.
Simulations are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method and to compare it with the
method in [5].
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is the system model and basic assumptions. In Section
3, we derive the method for STBC SC-FDE systems and give some further discussions about the proposed
algorithm. The effect of the precoding scheme on channel equalization is discussed in Section 4. Simulation
results are given in Section 5. Section 6 concludes this paper.

3.1 The Estimation Method
Using the STBC scheme in (2.1) and the facts that x(2i) = P1s(2i) and x(2i + 1) = P2s(2i + 1), (2.2)
can be expressed as: y(2i) = H1P1s(2i) +H2P2s(2i+ 1) +w(2i)y(2i+ 1)∗ = H∗2TP1s(2i)−H∗1TP2s(2i+ 1) +w(2i+ 1)∗ (3.1)
Let us first focus on the first equation in (3.1) and define matrices J, H(0)j , and H
(1)
j as follows: J ∈ RK×K
is a circulant matrix with [0 1 0 · · · 0]T being its first column, and ∀j = 1, 2, H(0)j ∈ C(L+2)×(L+2) is a
lower Toeplitz matrix with [hj(0) 0 0 · · · 0] being its first row and [hj(0) hj(1) · · · hj(L) 0]T being its first
column, and H(1)j ∈ C(L+2)×(L+2) is an upper Toeplitz matrix with [0 0 hj(L) hj(L− 1) · · · hj(1)] being its
first row and [0 0 · · · 0]T being its first column. Then it is easy to show
Hj = IK ⊗H(0)j + J⊗H(1)j , ∀j = 1, 2. (3.2)
For j = 1, 2, let the diagonal precoder Pj has the form of Pj = IK ⊗Dj , where Dj ∈ R(L+2)×(L+2) is a
diagonal matrix. Using the identity (A⊗B)(C⊗D) = AC⊗BD, HjPj becomes
HjPj = (IK ⊗H(0)j + J⊗H(1)j )(IK ⊗Dj) = IK ⊗ (H(0)j Dj) + J⊗ (H(1)j Dj) (3.3)
With assumption (i), the covariance matrix of y(2i) can be written as
R0 = E[y(2i)y(2i)H ] = (H1P1)(H1P1)H + (H2P2)(H2P2)H +Rw (3.4)
where Rw = E[w(2i)w(2i)H ]. Using equation (3.3) for j = 1, 2, we have
(HjPj)(HjPj)H

From (3.12), we can obtain the products of channel coefficients h1(m)h1(n)∗ for m,n = 0, 1, · · · , L to form a
rank one Hermitian matrix Q1 = h1hH1 , which is the outer-product matrix of h1. Then the channel impulse
response vector h1 is identified up to a scalar ambiguity by computing the unit-norm eigenvector associated
with the maximal eigenvalue of the matrix Q1.
To obtain another channel impulse response vector h2, we focus on the second equation in (3.1). Taking
expectation of y(2i+ 1)∗y(2i+ 1)T , we have

For each Υj(A), subtracting its last block row from its kth block row, k = 1, 2, · · · , L + 1 − j, we obtain
the products of channel-coefficient vectors h1(m)h1(n)∗ for m,n = 0, 1, · · · , L to form a rank one Hermitian
matrix Q1 = h1hH1 , which is the outer-product matrix of h1. Then the channel impulse response vector h1
is identified up to a scalar ambiguity by computing the unit-norm eigenvector associated with the maximal
eigenvalue of the matrix Q1. Perform a similar procedure on the covariance matrix of y(2i + 1), we can
obtain another channel inpulse vector h2.
3.3 Discussions
1) The effect of α and β: In Section 3.1, we use ej and fj , j = 0, 1, · · · , L to obtain the products of
channel coefficients. However, due to the presence of finite-sample estimation error in practice, we have
ej +4ej and fj +4fj instead of ej and fj , where 4ej and 4fj denote the error terms. If the difference
(α − β) is large, then dividing (ej + 4ej) (or (fj + 4fj)) by (α − β) will attenuate the error and thus
accurancy of the estimation of the products of channel coefficients increases. From the relation between α
and β (below (3.10)), we know a small β results in large (α− β) which brings better estimation of products
of channel coefficients and thus improves the estimation performance.
2) On ambiguity removal: From Section 3.1, we know that the channel impulse response hj is identified
up a saclar ambiguity uj , i.e., hj = ĥjuj where ĥj is the estimated channel impulse response vector for
j = 1, 2. To remove the ambiguities u1 and u2, some pilot symbols must be inserted in the input data. Since

4 Channel Equalization
Having derived the estimation method is Section 3, we now proceed to discuss the impact of the proposed
precoding on channel equalization in this section.
Once the channel is identified, we decompose the circulant matrixHj asHj = FHΛjF, where F ∈ CM×M
is the fast Fourier transform (FFT) matrix, and Λj is a diagonal matrix with [Λj ]mm =
∑L
l=0 hj(l)ω
−l(m−1)
for m = 1, 2, · · · ,M and ω = exp(i2pi/M). Let us define Y(k) = Fy(k), Xj(k) = Fxj(k), and W(k) =
Fw(k) ∀k = 2i, 2i + 1 and use the facts that X1(2i + 1) = −X2(2i)∗ and X2(2i + 1) = X1(2i)∗ due to the
properties of FFT [3]. Then the frequency-domain equalization representation of (2.2) can be written as [3]: Y(2i)

Multiplying both sides of (4.1) by ΛH while using the facts X1(2i) = Fx1(2i) = Fx(2i) and X2(2i) =
Fx2(2i) = Fx(2i+ 1), we have

where Z˜i = Λ∗Zi, V˜i = Λ∗Vi, and Λ˜ = Λ1Λ∗1 +Λ2Λ

2 ∈ RM×M is a diagonal matrix. From (4.2), we have
the following two equations:  Z˜
(1)
i = Λ˜Fx(2i) + V˜
(1)
i
Z˜(2)i = Λ˜Fx(2i+ 1) + V˜
(2)
i
(4.3)
where Z˜(1)i = Z˜i(1 :M, 1), Z˜
(2)
i = Z˜i(M + 1 : 2M, 1), and V˜
(j)
i is similarly defined as Z˜
(j)
i , ∀j = 1, 2.
Since Λ˜ is a diagonal matrix, one can design for each frequency tone a one-tap equalizer, e.g., by using
the zero forcing (ZF) equalizer Λ˜−1, to obtain the frequency domain source data Fx(2i) and Fx(2i + 1),
and then multiplying the frequency domain source data by FH to obtain an estimate of the time domain
source x(2i) and x(2i + 1). Since the precoding scheme is applied at the transmitter, i.e., x(2i) = P1s(2i)
and x(2i + 1) = P2s(2i + 1), we need to multiply the estimated x(2i) and x(2i + 1) by P−11 and P
−1
2 to
estimate s(2i) and s(2i+ 1), respectively. In other words, the estimated s(2i) and s(2i+ 1) can be obtained
by  ŝ(2i) = P
−1
1 F
HΛ˜−1Z˜(1)i
ŝ(2i+ 1) = P−12 F
HΛ˜−1Z˜(2)i
(4.4)
From (4.4), we know the equalization performance is related to P−1j and Λ˜
−1. Because Λ˜−1 is formed
from the estimated channel coefficients, we expect good channel estimation to bring an accurate Λ˜−1 and
thus improves the equalization performance. Also we know using the designed precoding Pj = IK⊗Dj with
10
Figure 4 show that there is a trade-off between estimation accuracy and noise amplification: For β ∈ [0.1 0.7],
although decreasing β brings good channel estimation accuracy and hence improves the accuracy of Λ˜−1,
the noise is amplified by P−1i . The dominant factor of equalization performance for β ∈ [0.1 0.7] is P−1i
rather than the accuracy of Λ˜−1 (or the estimation accuracy). Hence SER increases as β decreases. On the
other hand, for β ∈ [0.7 0.9], the dominant factor of equalization performance is the accuracy of Λ˜−1 (or
the estimation accuracy) rather than P−1i . Thus although decreasing β causes an increase in noise, it also
brings good channel estimation accuracy and hence improves the accuracy of Λ˜−1, and so SER decreases as
β decreases. From Figures 3 and 4, β = 0.7 seems to be a compromising optimal selection.
Simulation 2 – colored noise case
In this simulation, we use the precoding P1 and P2 with β = 0.7 to demonstrate the performance of
the proposed method when the channel noise is colored. The additive colored noise w(n) is generated by
passing a zero mean with unit variance white sequence wv(n) through a finite impulse response (FIR) filter
c(z) = 0.4 + 0.2z−1 + 0.1z−2 whose output is w(n) = c(z)wv(n). Figure 5 shows that the channel NMSE
and SER decreases as the number of data block S increases.
Simulation 3 – comparison with the method in [5]
In this simulation, we compare the equalization performance of the proposed method with that of another
precoding method [5]. The diagonal precoding {P1,P2} for the proposed method and P in the method [5]
are chosed with the same power threshold β = 0.7. Figure 6 shows that the equalization performance of the
proposed method is better than that of the method in [5].
Simulation 4 – channel estimation and equalization of a 2-input 2-output STBC SC-FDE
system
In this simulation, we apply the proposed method to a 2-input 2-output STBC SC-FDE system. Figure 7
shows the simulation results for channel estimation and equalization. Figure 7 also shows that the proposed
method can be extended to the MIMO case.
6 Conclusions
In this paper, we propose a method for blind channel estimation of STBC SC-FDE systems. Based on
the proposed precoding scheme, the channel noise may be colored and it is very easy to obtain the products
of channel coefficients by using only subtraction and division when the covariance matrices of the received
data are obtained. Then each of the two channel impulse response vectors can be obtained by taking eigen-
decomposition of a Hermitian matrix formed from the corresponding products of channel coefficients. The
performance of estimation algorithm depends on the choice of the precoders. The effect of the proposed
precoding on channel equalization is also discussed. The proposed method can apply to the MIMO case.
Simulation results are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method and to compare it with
