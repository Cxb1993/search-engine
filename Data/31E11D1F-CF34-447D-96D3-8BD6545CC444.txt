多功能特色。
一、前言
近年來無人飛行載具的應用日漸受到重視，尤其可用來作為通訊中繼或偵查的高空長航
時(high-altitude long-endurence, HALE)無人飛行載具，在美國及歐盟均已有計畫的進行開發。
執行 HALE 任務的無人飛行載具需在低溫、低壓的大氣環境下飛行，因而在設計上需同時考
慮低雷諾數及高次音速等空氣動力問題。採用高展弦比及低厚度比的設計是適當的選擇，但
結構卻相對的十分脆弱。連翼構型被視為解決方案之一，並且以 HALE 無人飛行載具的任務
需求來進行最佳化設計[1-3]。本研究目的即在設計製造一小型但
可有較高酬載及較長滯空時間之連翼型 UAV，以強化此型載具在未來市場上具有實際多功能
之用途。
本研究所採用的連翼型設計，其主要特徵為具有前後兩個機翼，且通常前翼後掠，而後
翼前掠，使得後翼翼端連接於前翼的中段或翼端。自 1976 年，Wolkovich 提出了連翼型的概
念後[4]，已有許多專家學者對此概念進行探討[5-7]。連翼型設計具有較佳的結構特性，是其
主要優點，因此在設計上可以達到下列幾項特點：[7]
1.在相同翼負載與展弦比情況下，結構重量較輕，剛性較佳。
2.在結構重量相同的條件之下，連翼型飛機的機翼可以採用較高的展弦比，可減少誘導
阻力，有較高的翼展效率。
3.前、後機翼面積比例較接近，可以獲得較高的配平最大升力係數。
4.針對高次音速飛機，機翼的最大厚度可以減少，能夠有效提升臨界馬赫數，而且比較
容易滿足穿音速飛機設計所需的 Whitcomb 面積律，可降低波阻力。
5.有較小的濕面積及寄生阻力。
6.當機翼具有較大的上反或下反角時，利用前、後機翼的控制面，可以產生直接的升力
或側向力，提高飛機的可控制性。
7.有良好的穩定性與控制性。
雖然有上述可達到的優點，但是有部份學者在整合空氣動力特性與結構最佳化的計算之
後，卻發現連翼型飛機的重量不一定會比傳統機翼少。在考慮中程航空運輸的營運費用計算，
連翼型飛機的營運費用可能會較高[8-10]。因此，雖然仍持續有飛機設計者將連翼型設計列入
考慮，但目前尚未有商用運輸的連翼飛機問世。不過，在運動用的輕航機及無人飛行載具方
面，已經有應用實例。例如澳洲的 Stratos 輕航機及美國 Dara Aviation 公司的 D-1 系列無人飛
行載具。
過去連翼型飛機的研究著重於中程航空運輸的應用，所以在小型無人飛行載具的雷諾數
範圍(<106)及馬赫數範圍(<0.1)內，並無詳細的空氣動力特性研究。自 2004 年起，賈等人[11-13]
開始進行連翼型載人與無人飛行載具的相關研究，以數值分析及風洞實驗分別探討連翼型飛
機的空氣動力特性。所採用的連翼構型與 Wolkovich [7]提出的構型略有不同，其後翼面積與
前翼相近，且無明顯的前掠(如圖 1)，較近似於 Boeing 近年來提出的構型[14]。
本文所述為連翼型無人飛行載具系統發展的初步成果，主要目的在於藉由實際的設計與
測試結果，進一步了解連翼型設計的飛行特性，並評估是否適合做為無人飛行載具的構型。

(二)氣動力實驗及模擬
1.低速風洞
本實驗採用一開放式低速風洞如圖 2 所示，風速操作範圍 3 m/s~30 m/s，其測試
區尺寸，長 210 cm、寬 100 cm、高 60 cm，自由流速入口區（settling chamber）安裝
三塊紗網降低紊流強度，再使用熱線測速儀（hot-wire anemometer）於測試區（test
section）量測紊流強度低於 0.5％。
本次主要實驗儀器分別為六力平衡儀（six-component force balance）、皮托管（Pitot
tube）、微壓計（pressure transduer）及類比數位訊號轉換器（A/D converter），實驗儀
器擷取之訊號傳送電腦儲存並分析。
測試模型乃為連翼機，其機身長度 20 cm、翼展 30.5 cm、高度 5 cm，圖 3
顯示飛機架設情形，飛機攻角由步進馬達控制器來調整，本次實驗目的在於不同雷諾
數下(Re=1×105、1.3×105、1.5×105 及 1.8×105) 探討連翼機的氣動力特性（如升力、
阻力及升阻比）。
實驗結果與討論
相同模型不同雷諾數下進行實驗，阻力方面，四種雷諾數下（Re=1×105、
1.3×105、1.5×105 及 1.8×105）前三者其阻力係數曲線幾乎重合在一起，這三條阻力
係數曲線，均位於攻角＋20 時阻力係數值最小，其最小阻力係數（ minDC ）約為 0.08，
隨著攻角增加（20 以上）阻力係數亦相對增加，雷諾數愈大，其 CD 愈大如圖 4 所示。
升力方面，本次實驗雷諾數屬於臨界雷諾數（Critical Reynolds number），其雷諾數範
圍，104＜Re＜106，於此雷諾數區間機翼表面易產生分離泡（separation bubble）改
變其邊界層現象、影響其空氣動力特性，分離泡可區分二種，一種稱之短分離泡（short
bubble），另一種稱之長分離泡（long bubble），前者分離泡產生與厚的機翼有關，後
者分離泡產生與薄的機翼有關，連翼機機翼屬於薄翼，雷諾數 Re=1×105 的升力係數
曲線於攻角 00 至 140 其 1＜CL＜1.25，雷諾數（Re=1.3×105 及 Re=1.5×105）的升力
係數曲線幾乎重合在一起，攻角 00 至 140 其 CL 約為 0.75，三條升力係數曲線之零
升力攻角均位於-20 至 00 之間如圖 5 所示，故雷諾數（Re=1.3×105 及 Re=1.5×105）
機翼表面可能產生分離泡，進而影響其升力。升阻比方面，四種雷諾數比較，Re=1×105
及 1.8×105 其升阻比為明顯為最佳，另 Re=1.3×105 及 Re=1.5×105 幾乎重疊在一起如
圖 6。
2.數值模擬
利用本研究團隊過去已發表之數值模擬方法[11]，針對本次開發之UAV進行CFD
模擬之結果顯示飛機表面壓力分布圖及機身縱面壓力圖，可參考圖 7 及圖 8。

Abstract: A joined-wing aircraft has some advantages: light weight, stronger stiffness, low induced drag,
higher lift force and payload capacity, etc. With the successful application of time-derivative preconditioning,
present hybrid finite volume solver is performed to obtain the steady state solutions in incompressible and
compressible flows. This solver which combined the advective upwind splitting method (AUSM) family of
low-diffusion flux-splitting scheme with an optimally smoothing multistage scheme and the time-derivative
preconditioning is used to solve the compressible Navier-stokes equations. In addition, a smoothing procedure
is used to provide a mechanism for controlling the numerical implementation to avoid the instability at
stagnation and sonic region. The effects of preconditioning on accuracy and convergence to the steady state of
the numerical solutions are presented. There are two type airfoils, E344 and Fx-67-k-170/17, and two types
sweep angle wing to analyze. A series of grid independent testing, and turbulent model select are valued. The
results for simulation found that we can only use the 3D wing model without fuselage to determine the
aerodynamic characteristics. In 3D full-scale case, the backward-sweep front wing model still keep good lift
coefficient.
Key-Words: joined-wing, CFD, finite volume, lift-drag-ratio
1 Introduction
The concept of joined-wing aircraft has been raised
in the 1980s by the U.S. aviation experts,
Wolkovitch.[1,2] The original design was based on
the collision protection, and had all the advantages
of two-wing aircraft. In 1979, researcher aroused
the interest of the concept, and started a series of
wind tunnel testing. According to Wolkovitch[3]
report, joined-wing hsaa the following characteristic:
(1) light weight, (2) stronger stiffness, (3) low
induced drag (4) lower drag in transonic and
supersonic, (5) higher lift and side force, (6) reduce
the wet area because of without tail section. From
the numerical results: a joined-wing has good
stability and control in normal flight, and also keeps
good performance in stall. It can reduce the
induced drag from the wing tip, and also decrease
the interference drag between fuselage and wing.
Therefore, it can reduce the total form drag
substantially.
Joined-wing is a highly combing product,
including aerodynamic and structure. However,
there were many cases in development, but the
aerodynamic coefficient is very poor. We used the
CFD to study the craft in different AOA, and
investigate the aerodynamic data for designing.
2 PHYSICAL MODEL AND GRID SYSTEM
This study used NACA4412 airfoil to design the 2D
and 3D models. Table 1 and 2 show the test matrix
for validation, including grid independent, time step,
and turbulent model. The based case is for the
validation. Uniformly spaced grids are used to
cover the flow field, and the stretching
transformation clusters, using the Roberts
generalized stretching transformation technique, are
made near the boundary layer. The multi-block
grid approach is used in the present study.
Computation was performed on finer and coarser
grids for a constant grid resolution; it was found that
the total grid sizes, especially in the y direction,
depend on the turbulence model used. According
to the present study, the average value of y+ closest
the surface was 0.2 with the exact solution for
turbulence models. The DELL OPTIPLX GX270
workstation was used for the computation. The 2D

5 High-Resolution Scheme
The numerical scheme, using the preconditioning
finite volume method, was introduced to solve the
governing flow equations. A 2nd-order scheme was
initially applied, so the left and right states ware
chosen to be the cell average values on the left and
right of the cell faces. In a high-resolution scheme,
in order to raise the order of accuracy of upwind
differencing, all one needs to do is to raise the order
of accuracy of the initial-value interpolation that
yields the zone-boundary data. Such schemes are
labelled as high resolution schemes as opposed to
Total Variation Diminishing（TVD）schemes, which
completely eliminate any of those spurious
oscillations when applied to one dimensional
nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws and linear
hyperbolic systems. The van Leer kappa-scheme, in
which the kappa number is one-third, was selected
to obtain the high-resolution upwind differencing
[8-10].
An optimal multi-stage scheme was used for the
time integration, and the multi-stage coefficients
ware modified by Tai[11] and redefined using the
Courant number for multi-dimensional use. Also, a
residual smoothing method was imposed to
accelerate convergence and to improve numerical
stability.
6 Results and Discussions
6.1 Scheme Validation
In order to validate the accuracy, grid independent,
turbulent models, and investigate the lift effect in 2D
and 3D flowfield. The NACA4412 airfoil model
was to be series studies in 2D and 3D, as show in
table1 and 2. We set up five 2D cases and foure
3D, as show in table 3. Using the NACA4412
airfoil shape establish the 2D airfoil and 3D WIG
wing models, as show in figure 2 and table 4. The
studies are tend to aspect ratio (AR)=2 in 3D cases,
and the normalized data shows in table 4.
6.1.1 2D airfoil Analysis
Prior to the formal airfoil flow studies, a grid
independent test was carried out. Simulations
using 19,548, 31,893, and 43,165 cells were carried
out respectively. A test result shown in Figure 3
indicates that simulation using 19,548 cells is
sufficient to assure grid-independent solutions.
This initial grid setup using 19,548 cells is therefore
used in the following simulations.
For time step test, simulations using 500, 1,000,
and 1,500 time steps were carried out respectively.
A test result shown in Figure 4 indicates that
simulation using 1,000 time steps is sufficient to
assure time accuracy. In turbulent models select,
the S-A and k-ε model were caried out.  Figure 5 
shows the results that the k-ε model is closed to the 
experiment data.
6.1.2 3D airfoil Analysis
Using the 2D method extend to the 3D case for the
validation. There were three cases to simulate the
flowfield in ground effect, and determine the
aerodynamic coefficient that compare with the
experiment data[5]. Case 2 and 3 were in the same
height, but the case2 without endplate. The
clearance between wing and ground is 0.3, and
cover ratio, e/h, is 1. The results of case 3 with
endplate show the lift increased 35%, and the
determine are close to experiment as shown in table
5. Table 6 shows the comparison in turbulent
model S-A and k-ε in case 3.  The result shows the 
k-ε model is closed to the experiment, and using the 
2D test procedure to find 3D characteristic as shown
in table 7 and 8. The total cells=580,000 and time
steps=1,000, finally.
6.2 Wing Type Analysis
In this study, the dihedral angle of the forward and
backward wing is individually 3 and 5 degree in 3D
configuration. The wing setup angle is 3 degree,
and no twist between the wing root and tip. The
design necessary shows in table 9.
Using two kinds of airfoil shape, E344 and
Fx67-k-170/17, tailless configuration for simulation.
The airfoil, Fx67-k-170/17, is using in the
joined-wing craft, Stratos. The aerodynamic
characteristics comparison of these two type airfoils
were in the same conditions.
Figure 6 to 8 show the simulation results without
fuselage that the drag are about the same between
E344 and Fx-67-k-170/17. In AOA=3.5°, the drag
of Fx-67-k-170/17 is higher then E344 about 0.7%.
The difference is bigger on drag when the angle of
attack is increasing. The lift of Fx-67-k-170/17 is
higher then E344 about 9%. The lift of E344 is
greatly increasing then Fx-67-k-170/17 when the
AOA＞14°. From the L/D profile, the L/D of
Fx-67-k-170/17 is clearly higher then E344 in
AOA=0°, and it is convenient for the loading in
taking off. The optimal L/D is in AOA=3.5°, and
to be a standard for level fight. However, the L/D

Abstract: A joined-wing aircraft has some advantages: light weight, stronger stiffness, low induced drag, 
higher lift force and payload capacity, etc.  With the successful application of time-derivative preconditioning, 
present hybrid finite volume solver is performed to obtain the steady state solutions in incompressible and 
compressible flows. This solver which combined the advective upwind splitting method (AUSM) family of 
low-diffusion flux-splitting scheme with an optimally smoothing multistage scheme and the time-derivative 
preconditioning is used to solve the compressible Navier-stokes equations. In addition, a smoothing procedure 
is used to provide a mechanism for controlling the numerical implementation to avoid the instability at 
stagnation and sonic region. The effects of preconditioning on accuracy and convergence to the steady state of 
the numerical solutions are presented. There are two type airfoils, E344 and Fx-67-k-170/17, and two types 
sweep angle wing to analyze. A series of grid independent testing, and turbulent model select are valued.  The 
results for simulation found that we can only use the 3D wing model without fuselage to determine the 
aerodynamic characteristics.  In 3D full-scale case, the backward-sweep front wing model still keep good lift 
coefficient.

1   Introduction 
The concept of joined-wing aircraft has been raised 
in the 1980s by the U.S. aviation experts, 
Wolkovitch.[1,2]  The original design was based on 
the collision protection, and had all the advantages 
of two-wing aircraft.  In 1979, researcher aroused 
the interest of the concept, and started a series of 
wind tunnel testing.  According to Wolkovitch[3] 
report, joined-wing hsaa the following characteristic: 
(1) light weight, (2) stronger stiffness, (3) low 
induced drag (4) lower drag in transonic and 
supersonic, (5) higher lift and side force, (6) reduce 
the wet area because of without tail section.   From 
the numerical results: a joined-wing has good 
stability and control in normal flight, and also keeps 
good performance in stall.  It can reduce the 
induced drag from the wing tip, and also decrease 
the interference drag between fuselage and wing.  
Therefore, it can reduce the total form drag 
substantially. 
    Joined-wing is a highly combing product, 
including aerodynamic and structure.  However, 
there were many cases in development, but the 
aerodynamic coefficient is very poor.  We used the 
CFD to study the craft in different AOA, and 
investigate the aerodynamic data for designing. 
 
2   PHYSICAL MODEL AND GRID 
SYSTEM 
This study used NACA4412 airfoil to design the 2D 
and 3D models.  Table 1 and 2 show the test matrix 
for validation, including grid independent, time step, 
and turbulent model.  The based case is for the 
validation.  Uniformly spaced grids are used to 
cover the flow field, and the stretching 
transformation clusters, using the Roberts 
generalized stretching transformation technique, are 
made near the boundary layer.  The multi-block 
grid approach is used in the present study.  
Computation was performed on finer and coarser 
grids for a constant grid resolution; it was found that 
the total grid sizes, especially in the y direction, 
depend on the turbulence model used.  According 
to the present study, the average value of y+ closest

5  High-Resolution Scheme 
The numerical scheme, using the preconditioning 
finite volume method, was introduced to solve the 
governing flow equations. A 2nd-order scheme was 
initially applied, so the left and right states ware 
chosen to be the cell average values on the left and 
right of the cell faces. In a high-resolution scheme, 
in order to raise the order of accuracy of upwind 
differencing, all one needs to do is to raise the order 
of accuracy of the initial-value interpolation that 
yields the zone-boundary data. Such schemes are 
labelled as high resolution schemes as opposed to 
Total Variation Diminishing（TVD） schemes, which 
completely eliminate any of those spurious 
oscillations when applied to one dimensional 
nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws and linear 
hyperbolic systems. The van Leer kappa-scheme, in 
which the kappa number is one-third, was selected 
to obtain the high-resolution upwind differencing 
[8-10]. 
An optimal multi-stage scheme was used for the 
time integration, and the multi-stage coefficients 
ware modified by Tai[11] and redefined using the 
Courant number for multi-dimensional use. Also, a 
residual smoothing method was imposed to 
accelerate convergence and to improve numerical 
stability. 
 
 
6  Results and Discussions 
 
6.1  Scheme Validation 
In order to validate the accuracy, grid independent, 
turbulent models, and investigate the lift effect in 2D 
and 3D flowfield.  The  NACA4412 airfoil model 
was to be series studies in 2D and 3D, as show in 
table1 and 2.  We set up five 2D cases and foure 
3D, as show in table 3.  Using the NACA4412 
airfoil shape establish the 2D airfoil and 3D WIG 
wing models, as show in figure 2 and table 4.  The 
studies are tend to aspect ratio (AR)=2 in 3D cases, 
and the normalized data shows in table 4. 
 
6.1.1  2D airfoil Analysis 
Prior to the formal airfoil flow studies, a grid 
independent test was carried out.  Simulations 
using 19,548, 31,893, and 43,165 cells were carried 
out respectively.  A test result shown in Figure 3 
indicates that simulation using 19,548 cells is 
sufficient to assure grid-independent solutions.  
This initial grid setup using 19,548 cells is therefore 
used in the following simulations. 
For time step test, simulations using 500, 1,000, 
and 1,500 time steps were carried out respectively.  
A test result shown in Figure 4 indicates that 
simulation using 1,000 time steps is sufficient to 
assure time accuracy.  In turbulent models select, 
the S-A and k-ε model were carried out.  Figure 5 
shows the results that the k-ε model is closed to the 
experiment data. 
 
6.1.2  3D airfoil Analysis 
Using the 2D method extend to the 3D case for the 
validation.  There were three cases to simulate the 
flowfield in ground effect, and determine the 
aerodynamic coefficient that compare with the 
experiment data[5].  Case 2 and 3 were in the same 
height, but the case2 without endplate.  The 
clearance between wing and ground is 0.3, and 
cover ratio, e/h, is 1.  The results of case 3 with 
endplate show the lift increased 35%, and the 
determine are close to experiment as shown in table 
5.  Table 6 shows the comparison in turbulent 
model S-A and k-ε in case 3.  The result shows the 
k-ε model is closed to the experiment, and using the 
2D test procedure to find 3D characteristic as shown 
in table 7 and 8.  The total cells=580,000 and time 
steps=1,000, finally. 
 
6.2  Wing Type Analysis 
In this study, the dihedral angle of the forward and 
backward wing is individually 3 and 5 degree in 3D 
configuration.  The wing setup angle is 3 degree, 
and no twist between the wing root and tip.  The 
design necessary shows in table 9. 
Using two kinds of airfoil shape, E344 and 
Fx67-k-170/17, tailless configuration for simulation. 
The airfoil, Fx67-k-170/17, is using in the 
joined-wing craft, Stratos.  The aerodynamic 
characteristics comparison of these two type airfoils 
were in the same conditions. 
Figure 6 to 8 show the simulation results without 
fuselage that the drag are about the same between 
E344 and Fx-67-k-170/17.  In AOA=3.5°, the drag 
of  Fx-67-k-170/17 is higher then E344 about 0.7%.  
The difference is bigger on drag when the angle of 
attack is increasing.  The lift of Fx-67-k-170/17 is 
higher then E344 about 9%.  The lift of E344 is 
greatly increasing then Fx-67-k-170/17 when the
