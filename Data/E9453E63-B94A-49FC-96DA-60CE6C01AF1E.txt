method [22], the relationship between the center positions of the circle and the ellipse is not described mathematically. 
Therefore, the measurement accuracy of the developed system is limited. 
In the paper a dot target, a translation stage, and a CCD camera with its sensor plane being parallel to the surface of 
the dot target were used to determined the center position of the circular dots on the dot target so that a world coordinate 
system and M calibration points can be obtained. Then these M calibration points were used to calibrate the stereo 
vision formed by two CCD cameras. Since the projection of the circle dot on the image plane is an ellipse [23], the 
relationship [12] between the center of the circle dot and the center of the ellipse was obtained mathematically in the 
paper to reduce the bias between the camera model and the observed center of the ellipses. In addition, both of the radial 
and decentering lens distortions are included in the camera model to improve the accuracy of the model equation. 
After camera calibration, the tensile tests on the double dots specimen, the dot grids specimen, and the random 
pattern specimen were conducted and the calibrated stereo vision was used to measure the deformation field of the 
specimens and calculate the axial strain, lateral strain, and Poisson’s ratio to evaluate the ability of the stereo vision to 
measure a deformed body.

As shown in Figure 1, the image plane is in front of the lens center C and the focal length f is the distance between the 
image plane and the lens center; O and O′ are the centers of the world coordinate system X-Y-Z and the image 
coordinate system u-v, respectively; C is the center of the camera coordinate system x-y-z. The u- and v-axes are parallel 
to the x- and y-axes, respectively. The projection of the object point P(X, Y, Z) in world coordinates to the image point 
Pc(uc, vc) in image coordinates can be ideally described by the following equation

where F is a perspective transformation matrix which is defined by focal length f, image plane center (u0, v0), 
translation vector t = [tx, ty, tz] between the world and camera frames, and rotation matrix R = R(θ, φ, ϕ). It is noted that 
θ, φ, and ϕ are the angles of rotation about the y, x, and z axes, respectively. In practice, radial distortion and 
decentering effects are present in most lenses. The corrections (∆u, ∆v) are added to the distorted image coordinates (ud,

Figure 6 Error distribution for measured calibration points in the X-, Y-, and Z-directions 
As in previous work [20,21], the dot target and camera three shown in the Fig. 4 form a grid calibration system and 
are used to accurately calibrate the location of the dots relative to an erected object coordinate system Y-Z. It is noted 
here that in the setup of the 3-D measurement system the sensor area of camera three is almost parallel to the surface of 
the dot target, i.e., the sensor area is perpendicular to the x-direction of the translation stage. The grid image with a 
resolution of 640 by 480 pixels was captured using a JAI CVM10 CCD camera equipped with a 105 mm Nikkor lens. It 
is noted that in the paper the dot center is taken as calibration point. Following the determination of the location of the 
N by N circular dots, a world coordinate system X-Y-Z and M calibration points with known world coordinates were 
then resulted. It is also noted that the X-axis is sensed in the X-direction of the translation stage. With these calibration 
points in the space and their corresponding conjugate pairs (i.e., the projections of the calibration points onto the image 
planes of camera one and two), each camera in the stereo vision system was calibrated independently using the

4.3 Tensile tests 
 
In the paper the tension test specimens were made of Aluminum 5052. White paint was first sprayed onto the surface 
of the specimen and then circle grid was pasted on its surface to make a pattern of double dots or circle grid. Also white 
and black paint was sprayed onto the surface of the specimen to produce a random pattern. Tensile tests were conducted 
on these specimens and the calibrated stereo vision was used to measure their deformation field. The axial and lateral 
strains were measured simultaneously to obtain the stress-strain curve and Poisson’s ratio of the Aluminum 5052 to 
evaluate the ability of the stereo vision to measure a deformed body. It is noted that in the experiments a load cell and 
an extensometer with the extended gage length of 25 mm were used to record the applied load and the elongation of the 
specimens, respectively.

Figure 10 Stress-strain curve for AL 5052 
(double-dot specimen) 
 
Shown in Figure 9 is the image of the tension test specimen with the pattern of double dots taken by camera two at 
the applied load of 21.9 kN. By processing the images before and after the deformation of the specimen, the center 
position of both dots is determined and the axial strain of the specimen is obtained by 0lly ∆=ε , where l0 is the 
original distance between the dots and ∆l the change of the distance. The stress-strain curve of the AL 5052 is shown in 
Figure 10. Results indicate that the obtained axial strains are in good agreement with the strain measurements of the 
extensometer. 
Figure 11 shows the image of the tension test specimen with a grid of circular dots. By measuring the center position 
of the top and bottom dots located at the 2nd or 3rd column of the grid before and after the deformation of the specimen, 
the axial strain was computed using yy ll )/( 0∆=ε . In a similar way, the lateral strain was computed using 
xx ll )/( 0∆=ε  by measuring the center position of the left and right dots located at the 4th or 5th row of the grid. As 
indicated in Table 2, the computed values of εx and εy were compared to the extensometer measurements at several 
applied loads. Poisson’s ratio calculated by ( ) ( )yx llll 00 ∆∆  is also presented in Table 2. A larger deviation between 
the axial strain measurements of the extensometer and stereo vision is found at the small strain values of 0.05 percent. 
This large deviation is due to fact that the measurement accuracy of the 3-D measurement system is about ± 100 
micro-strains. For larger axial strain values, it is observed that the deviation is within the range of 0.9 percent to 7.9 
percent. At the strain value of 0.02 percent, in which the material is in the elastic deformation state, the calculated 
Poisson’s ratio is 0.343. When the axial strain value is increased to 0.43 percent or higher, the material starts to enter the 
plastic deformation state and the measured Poisson’s ratio approaches to 0.399.

was obtained from (1,0,0) mm rigid body translation tests. For (1,1,1) mm rigid body translation tests, the total error is 
about ±2 µm. Experimental results for the tensile tests conducted in the paper indicate that the 3-D measurement system 
can be applied to measure a deformation field of a deformed object. The 3-D measurement system has the advantage 
that the accuracy of the measured in-plane displacement components will be not affected by the out-of-plane motion of 
the object. The measurement accuracy of the proposed system may be improved by using a high precision translation 
stage and a commercial dot target.
