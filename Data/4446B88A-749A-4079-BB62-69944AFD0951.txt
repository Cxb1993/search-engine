英文摘要： 
The properties of the ZnO deposits electroplated with direct- and pulse-current on 
ITO-coated glass from the zinc-nitrate based electrolyte were investigated. The surface 
morphologies of the electroplated ZnO deposits were examined with field emission scanning 
electron microscope, and the microstructures were examined with X-ray diffractrometer. 
Meanwhile transparencies of ZnO-coated ITO films were measured. Experimental results showed 
that the surface morphology, microstructure, and optical properties of the ZnO deposits depend 
strongly on the bath temperature and plating current density. Amorphous structure was detected 
when ZnO deposits were electroplated at the bath temperature of 30 OC; whereas crystalline ZnO 
deposits with large hexagonal grains were found at 60OC. ZnO deposits prepared at 30OC 
revealed higher transparencies than those prepared at 60OC. Moreover, the transparency of ITO 
glass at a wavelength higher than 500 nm can be obviously improved when a thin ZnO layer was 
deposited on ITO film with pulse-current plating at 30OC. Different energy bandgaps can be 
found from the ZnO deposits prepared with direct and pulse current, and the former is 3.16 eV 
the latter 3.47 eV.

1. Introduction 
Based on the variety of optoelectronic devices, transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) are 
being improved to meet the requirements of devices. Zinc oxide, an n-type semiconductor with 
direct energy bandgap of 3.4 eV, and its related materials are being widely applied in 
optoelectronic devices, such as light emitting devices, solar cell, and chemical sensors, etc., 
owing to its particular electrical and optical properties. Until now, the gas phase techniques, such 
as sputtering, MOCVD, and pulse laser deposition etc., are the main methods to prepare TOCs. 
However, preparation of ZnO deposit with electroplating method has been much more attracted 
because of low cost and convenience for mass production.  
 
The electrodepostion for preparing ZnO deposit was first developed by Izaki et al. [2] and 
Lincot [3]. Recently, most studies prepared ZnO deposits by potentiostatic electrodeposition [4-8]. 
However, its drawback is associated with the complicated process which results in the production 
of hydrogen at a high current density during electroplating. Pulsed current electroplating is being 
widely used in electroplating industry and surface treatment, etc. It exhibits several advantages 
compared with both potentiostatic and galvanostatic plating techniques. For nucleation and 
growth, the application of pulse-current electroplating can easily increase nuclei density and 
obtain fine-grain deposit. Moreover, the defects on deposit surface, such as pinholes, cracks, and 
voids etc., could be reduced, attributing to electroplating with relatively high current density [9]. 
In addition, it is possible to improve the properties of deposits, for example, corrosion resistance 
and electrical resistance [9]. 
 
It has been reported that optical transmittance of ZnO deposits is strongly related to the 
surface roughness [10]. In the related reports about ZnO deposits electroplated with pulsed 
are employed for thin film analyses with a very low incident angel of 0.3o. Surface morphology 
and chemical composition of the electroplated ZnO deposits were observed with a field-emission 
electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi Model S-4700) integrated with an energy dispersive x-ray 
spectrometer (EDS; EDAX company, series No: 8318-46390 ME) for chemical composition 
analysis.

3. Results and discussion 
3.1 Microstructure 
XRD patterns of ITO film and the ZnO deposits prepared with direct-current at different 
bath temperatures are shown in Fig. 2. The results show that ITO film has (222) preferred 
orientation; while all the 30OC-prepared ZnO deposits exhibit the peaks from ITO film only. Zinc 
hydroxide do not appeared in pattern, although it could be found in the wet process through 
incorporation of a hydroxide phase in the deposit [16]. It is probably that zinc oxide or zinc 
hydroxide is amorphous and its quantity is too low to be detected. On the other hand, obvious 
ZnO peaks, (100), (002), and (101), which correspond to the würtzite structure of ZnO, were 
detected from the 60OC-prepared ZnO deposits. They have the preferred orientation of (101) 
plane. This result is disagreement with the other studies [17, 18], in which ZnO deposit prepared 
with rf sputtering has [002] preferred orientation. Yoshida [18] reported that the (002) plane of 
ZnO is the closest packed and the most stable plane in contact with the solution. The result shown 
in our case implies that the growth orientation could be affected by electroplating current density. 
The results in this study are similar to that reported from Izaki et al [2, 19]. They indicated that 
(001) and (101)- diffracted peaks were always observed in XRD patterns with whatever the zinc 
nitrate concentration and electroplating current density. In addition, the peak of (002) plane was 
weakened with increasing electroplating current density [19]. Pauporté [5] reported that the 
energetic interaction between ZnO deposit and electrolyte is strongly related to growth direction. 
Thus our results indicate that the interaction between nitrate and the ZnO deposit could change 
the energetic properties of the interface. 
 
XRD patterns of the ZnO deposits prepared with pulsed current electrolyte with different 
pulse ratios are shown in Fig. 3. As results shown in Fig. 3(a), no peaks corresponded to ZnO 
were observed except the ITO peaks with (222) preferred orientation. It could be attributed to the 
very thin thickness which can not provide the enough intensity. The declined intensity of ITO 
(222) peak was observed from the pulse-prepared ZnO deposit with pulse ratio of 2 : 1. It means 
that the crystallinity at (222) plane was decreased attributing to the more ZnO particles formed at 
this condition. Fig. 3(b) demonstrates the XRD patterns of the ZnO deposits prepared at 60OC. 
The XRD peaks match with JCPDS file [20] which clearly indicates that ZnO with hexagonal 
würtzite type structure. These three deposits all have [101] preferred orientation and their 
intensities increased with the increased Ton. Generally, ZnO grains grow with c-axis, i.e., [002] 
direction, perpendicular to substrate due to (002) plane has the lowest surface energy [11]. 
Moreover, this phenomenon was not revealed here. It is probably caused from electric field or the 
different stoichiometry presented in films. Izaki [2] reported that that (001) and (101) planes were 
always observed in XRD patterns with whatever the zinc nitrate concentration and current density 
used. This could also be related the other effects, such as substrate and electric filed in 
electroplating case. Its mechanism is not clear yet. The reason for the weakest intensity of (101) 
peak revealed at pulse ratio of 1 : 2 could be related to the smaller grain size. In general, the 
increased intensity and decreased FWHM (full width at half maximum) indicate the better 
crystallinity [21]. Hence, this XRD results coincided with FESEM examinations which show the 
Mainly, fringe appeared along transparency curve of films with very small surface roughness [22]. 
It can be proved from our results. The transparency of the ZnO-coated ITO films prepared with 
pulse ratio of 1 : 1 was better than those of the other two pulse ratios about 10%. It is not 
coincided to the smaller surface roughness presented on the ZnO deposit prepared with pulse 
ratio of 1 : 2. 
 
In general, the optical absorption onset of ZnO deposits were at around 350-370 nm. In 
order to obtain optical energy band gap, two ZnO-coated ITO films prepared with direct and 
pulse depositions at 30OC which have better transparencies were measured with background of 
ITO film using a double beam spectrometer (PERKIN ELMER Lambda 900) at wavelength 
ranging from 250 to 1000 nm as shown in Fig. 8. The insets in Fig. 8(a) and (b) represent the plot 
of (α h υ)2 vs. h υ. By taking ITO film as background, both of the ZnO deposits exhibited the 
excellent transparencies which are over 100% through visible wavelength range. Two Eg values, 
3.16 and 3.47 eV, are exhibited for the ZnO deposits prepared with galvanostatic and pulsed 
depositions, respectively.  
 
 
4.  Conclusions 
The effects of bath temperatures and direct- and pulse-current on the structural and optical 
properties of ZnO deposits were investigated. No obvious ZnO crystal orientation was found 
from the 30OC-prepared ZnO deposits. It is probably that the film is amorphous or its quantity is 
very low to be detected. The 60OC-prepared ZnO deposit revealed the würtzite structure with the 
preferred orientation in (101) plane. This result is disagreement with the others, which have (002) 
preferred orientation, prepared with rf sputtering. It implied that the growth orientation might be 
affected by current density and electric field. Similarly, the ZnO deposits prepared with pulsed 
current methods appeared like the direct-prepared ZnO deposits.  
 
The wavelike films with smooth and partially crystallized granular particles were found 
from the 30OC-prepared ZnO deposits, and the lowest surface roughness was found when pulse 
ratio was 1 : 1. The 60OC-prepared ZnO deposit revealed a homogeneous structure composed of 
columnar grains without pores and voids.  Pulsed current methods effectively altered the 
structure of the 60OC-prepared ZnO deposit with smaller grain size and lower surface roughness, 
and one can alter the surface roughness by adjusting the ratio of Ton and Toff.  
 
In terms of optical properties, the 30OC-prepared ZnO deposits revealed the higher 
transparencies than those of the 60OC-prepared ZnO deposits. The pulse-prepared ZnO deposits 
at 30OC exhibited the superior transparencies to that of the bare ITO film at wavelength over 500 
nm. By taking ITO film as background, the 30OC- prepared ZnO deposits exhibited the excellent 
transparencies over 100% through whole visible wavelength range. Two Eg values, 3.16 and 3.47 
eV, are found from the ZnO deposits prepared with direct- and pulse- current methods, 
respectively.
