英文摘要 
In 802.11-based wireless local-area networks (WLANs), it is difficult to achieve high throughput, 
while maintaining fairness, for multi-rate traffic. There is a performance anomaly when there are 
stations whose data rates are much lower than the other stations, in which the aggregate throughput 
of the stations with higher data rates degrades dramatically. In [14], the problem of maximizing the 
total throughput, while maintaining time fairness among competing stations, was studied. However, 
the solution method proposed in [14] sacrificed the throughput of low-rate stations. Instead, in this 
report, we intend to study the problem of maximizing the total throughput, while maintaining both 
time fairness and throughput fairness. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear 
programming problem is formulated. The two fairness indices are maintained by means of changing 
the channel access probability and the transmission time among competing stations, which can be 
realized by adjusting their minimum contention window sizes and their MAC frame sizes, 
respectively. A penalty function accompanied with a gradient-based approach is used to solve the 
problem. The effectiveness of the proposed approach and the approach in [14] are verified and 
compared through computational experiments. Useful guidelines are also provided to regulate the 
parameters needed for the approach.

1 Introduction 
In the last few years, the development of IEEE 802.11 [1] has been widely adopted in many hot 
spots and has become the de facto wireless local-area network (WLAN) standard. The IEEE 802.11 
standard specifies multiple modulation types to react against different channel conditions. Robust 
codes with more encoded bits (i.e., with a lower data rate) are transmitted so as to preserve their bit 
error rate below a specific threshold when the channel quality worsens. Hence, different modulation 
types are used to accommodate the tradeoff between the data rate and the bit error rate in different 
fading environments. 
 In [2], a performance anomaly was theoretically analyzed when multi-rate traffic was present 
in IEEE 802.11b WLANs [3]. In the performance anomaly, the aggregate throughput of the stations 
with higher data rates degrades dramatically to the same level as that of the stations with lower data 
rates. Since the basic CSMA/CA channel access method guarantees that the long-term channel 
access probabilities of all stations (with different data rates) are equal, the low-rate stations has 
more long-term channel occupancy time than the high-rate stations. If one low-rate station captures 
the channel, it will last for a long time and hence penalizes the aggregate throughput of the high-rate 
stations.  
 Table I shows two scenarios that were simulated with ns-2 simulator [4]. In scenario 1, there 
were two stations that transmitted their data with 11 Mbps. In scenario 2, one station transmitted 
data with 11 Mbps and the other station transmitted data with 1 Mbps. In both scenarios, the traffic 
loads of the two stations were saturated, i.e., their queues always had packets ready to transmit, and 
their frame sizes were the same. Observe that in scenario 2, the throughput of station A was almost 
the same as that of station B. There was a performance anomaly, because station B transmitted data 
with 11 Mbps and station A transmitted data only with 1 Mbps. This performance anomaly will also 
happen when backward compatibility is supported to 802.11 series of products. For example, IEEE 
802.11b/g [3, 5] is backward compatible with basic IEEE 802.11. The stations using IEEE

 In [14], the problem of maximizing the total throughput, while maintaining time fairness 
among competing stations, was studied. However, the solution method proposed in [14] sacrificed 
the throughput of low-rate stations. Instead, in this report, we intend to maximize the total throughput, 
while maintaining both time fairness and throughput fairness. The optimization problem is formulated 
as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming, and a solution method is proposed which is based on a 
penalty function accompanied with a gradient-based approach [15]. The effectiveness of the proposed 
approach is verified through computational experiments. Useful guidelines are also provided to 
regulate the parameters needed for the approach.  
 The rest of this report is organized as follows. In Section 2, the optimization problem is 
formulated. In Section 3, a penalty function accompanied with a gradient-based approach is proposed 
to solve the problem. In Section 4, computational experiments are made to evaluate the performance 
of the proposed approach. In Section 5, this report concludes with some remarks.    
2 Multi-Rate Throughput Optimization  
The system environment we consider is a single wireless cell coordinated by an access point (AP). 
Each station that intends to transmit packets has to forward its packets to the AP, even if they are 
destined for a station located within the same cell. Besides, there is no hidden terminal problem. 
Without loss of generality, we assume that there are r modulation types with different data rates in 
the system, where r ≥ 1. That is, each station can use the set R = {R1, R2, … , Rr} of data rates to 
transmit its data. Stations are categorized into different traffic classes according to their data rates. 
The stations with data rate Rk collectively form the traffic class k, where 1 ≤ k ≤ r. We use nk to 
denote the number of stations in the traffic class k. Also, we let n = ∑ =
r
i i
n
1
. A station is referred to 
as a class-k station if it belongs to the traffic class k. Packets transmitted by class-k stations are 
referred to as class-k packets. We assume that each class-k packet has length Lk and each class-k 
station has the minimum contention window size Wk.  
 7 
 The objective is to maximize the total throughput of all stations. The first constraint requires 
that TFI should maintain a fixed value a. The second constraint (third constraint) requires that the 
length of each class-k packet (the minimum contention window size of each class-k station) should 
be bounded within a range from Lmin to Lmax (from Wmin to Wmax).  
 When the channel time occupied by each station is equal (i.e., a time-fair situation), we have 
fi = 1/n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ r, and hence TFI = 1. On the other hand, suppose that the traffic class k has the 
fewest stations among all traffic classes. When the channel time is occupied exclusively by the 
class-k stations (i.e., a time-unfair situation), we have fk = 1/nk, because each class-k station has the 
same opportunity to capture the channel, and fi = 0 for all i ≠ k. Hence, TFI = nk/∑ =
r
i i
n
1
. 
 In the problem formulation above, only time fairness is considered, and as a consequence, the 
total throughput of low-rate stations will be much smaller than the total throughput of high-rate 
stations. The following problem formulation, which is also a mixed-integer nonlinear programming, 
can maintain throughput fairness as well.

 The second constraint, i.e., TPFI = b, is added to guarantee throughput fairness among different 
traffic classes, where b is a constant.

4 Computational Experiments 
The IEEE 802.11b standard [3] is used as the physical layer in the experiments. There are four 
modulation types specified in IEEE 802.11b, where four data rates 1 Mbps, 2 Mbps, 5.5 Mbps and 
11 Mbps are available for data transmission. The two-way handshaking mechanism (i.e., DATA- 
ACK) is adopted for data transmission between stations. There are four stations in the system whose 
data rates are 1 Mbps, 2 Mbps, 5.5 Mbps and 11 Mbps, respectively, i.e., (n1, n2, n3, n4) = (1, 1, 1, 1) 
and (R1, R2, R3, R4) = (1, 2, 5.5, 11). We set Lmin = 41, Lmax = 2304, Wmin = 32, and Wmax = 1024. All 
the computational experiments are made in a personal computer that is equipped with Intel Pentium 
D CPU 3.4 GHz and 512 MB RAM. 
 In order to validate our results (i.e., total throughput) obtained from the analytical model, ns-2 
simulation is made. Table II shows the results obtained from both analytical and simulation results, 
where the parameters, (n1, n2, n3, n4) and (W1, …, W4, L1, …, L4), in the five cases are randomly 
picked up. It can be seen from Table II that both analytical results and simulation results in the five 
cases are close to each other.  
 Table III(a) shows the penalty form for the problem of computing P, where µ0 = 1, β = 8, ε = 
10
–4
, a = 0.7, b = 0.7 and x(0) = (32, 32, 32, 32, 41, 41, 41, 41) are assumed. When t = 0, the penalty 
multiplier is set to µ0, and the gradient-based algorithm generates a solution with TFI = 0.4088 and 
TPFI = 0.3219, which violates the constraints of TFI = 0.7 and TPFI = 0.7. Then the penalty 
multiplier increases by a factor of β = 8, i.e., µ1 = β × µ0, and the iteration of t = 1 starts. The 
execution continues until both TFI and TPFI sufficiently approach 0.7. Finally, when t = 4, the 
execution terminates with the total throughput (i.e., the value of P) 2.2581 Mbps. The total 
throughput decreases when t increases (except t = 0). Table III(b) shows the penalty form for the 
problem of computing P' with the same values of µ0, β, a and x(0). Similarly, the total throughput 
(i.e., the value of P') decreases when t increases (except t = 0).  
 
 13
 Table IV show the total throughputs for the problem of computing P and the problem of 
computing P', respectively, that are obtained for 16 initial points x(0), where µ0 = 1, β = 8, a = 0.7 and 
b = 0.7 are assumed. They are all extreme points; namely, their coordinates are set to extreme 
values (32 or 1024 for W1, W2, W3 and W4, and 41 or 2304 for L1, L2, L3 and L4). There are 2
8
 = 256 
extreme points in total, and we randomly choose 16 from them. It is observed that the selection of 
x(0) has a great effect on the total throughput.  
 Table II, Table III, Figure 2 and Figure 3 together show that the two penalty algorithms for 
solving the problem of computing P and the problem of computing P' perform similarly. On the 
other hand, the purpose of introducing the problem of computing P is to maintain both time fairness 
and throughput fairness, while maximizing the total throughput. The effectiveness is verified in Table 
IV. 
 Table V shows the aggregate throughputs of four traffic classes and the total throughput for the 
problem of computing P and the problem of computing P', where µ0 = 1, β = 8, ε = 10
–4
 and a = 0.7 
are assumed. Each total throughput is the maximum of the total throughputs induced by the 256 
extreme points. As described in [14], the globally optimal point is usually close to some extreme 
point.  
 For the problem of computing P, the total throughput decreases when the value of b increases. 
When b = 1, the aggregate throughputs (0.3853 Mbps, 0.3982 Mbps, 0.3969 Mbps, and 0.3783 
Mbps) of the four traffic classes are close, but the total throughput (1.5587 Mbps) is rather small. 
For the problem of computing P', although the total throughput (4.2481 Mbps) is higher, the 
aggregate throughputs (0.0054 Mbps, 0.0352 Mbps, 1.3516 Mbps, and 2.8559 Mbps) of the four 
traffic classes are uneven. The better values of b range from 0.5 to 0.7 for this example. 
 Finally, notice that the penalty algorithm may generate a fractional solution. It should be 
rounded to an integral solution. A fractional solution can be rounded to any of at most 2
2r
 possible 
integral solutions. As shown in [14], the total throughputs induced by the 2
2r
 integral solutions are 
close to the total throughput induced by the original fractional solution. 
 15
 If the computing time is required to be concerned, the offline computing is one way for an AP 
to pre-compute the results and save them in a table. It is not necessary to save the results for all the 
combinations of number of nodes with different traffic classes. Instead, the AP could statistically 
measure and summarize the information related to the combinations. Then the AP could only 
compute the results of specific combinations. In this strategy, message exchange and/or network 
status feedback could be applied.
