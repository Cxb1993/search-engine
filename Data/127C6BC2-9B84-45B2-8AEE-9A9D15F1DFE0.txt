Introduction 
    Handwriting is an essential fine motor skill in school-aged children. Children’s ability to produce fluent 
and legible script is important for expressing, communicating and recording ideas as well as for educational 
development, achievement in school and self-esteem (Phelps, Stemple & Speck, 1985; Weil & Amundson, 
1994). This skill is directly related to most school activities. From a survey of the activities in an elementary 
school classroom, 30% to 60% of the time is spent in fine motor activities, with handwriting predominating over 
other tasks (McHale & Cermak, 1992). From surveys on occupational therapy service in elementary schools, the 
most common referrals were handwriting problems (Tseng & Cermak, 1993).  
    Although children with normal development can learn how to write through traditional training between 
ages six to seven, handwriting is actually a very complicated skill. Neat and smooth handwriting requires the 
maturity and integration of cognition, visual perception and fine motor skills (Tseng & Murray, 1994; Weil & 
Amundson, 1994; Volman, van Schendel, & Jongmans, 2006). Levine et al. (1981) found that 72% of children 
with low academic achievement were considered to have difficulty with fine motor tasks for such 
dysfunctions on relevant items in the parent and/or teacher questionnaires (e.g., using a pencil, putting things 
together, etc). Poor fine motor control such as the lack of coordination of muscle contractions and the 
irregularities of stroke speed and force may lead to laborious or even illegible handwriting. Assessment of fine 
motor control in handwriting movement is thus important in a comprehensive evaluation of handwriting 
dysfunction. However, since handwriting involves a complicated series of fine movement controls, it is 
difficult to assess finger movement simply by visual inspection. Computerized kinematic and kinetic analyses 
provide a direct measurement of fine motor control in the handwriting process. With the aid of a digital tablet 
and instrumented ink pen, handwriting can be monitored in real-time or stored in formats for further kinematic 
and kinetic analyses. These devices enable the researcher to evaluate and fully analyze handwriting in both 
temporal and spatial dimensions, all with greater precision that has the potential to provide greater insights into 
the handwriting process (Marquardt & Mai, 1994; Mergl, Tigges, Schroter, Moller & Hegerl, 1999; Rosenblum, 
Parush & Weiss, 2003; Di Brina, Niels, Overvelde, Levi & Hulstijn, 2008; Rosenblum & Livneh-Zirinski, 
2008). 
Based on the view of van Galen’s model of handwriting (van Galen, Portier, Smits-Engelsman, & 
 4
increased significantly as task length increased from word to sentence to paragraph (Rosenblum, Parush and 
Weiss, 2003). In order to study the motor dysfunction of handwriting deficits in DCD and to develop a quick 
and practical evaluation tool, Rosenblum and Livneh-Zirinski (2008) found significant differences between 
the different chosen groups for the handwriting process measures (on-paper and in-air time, mean pressure) 
and for the handwriting product characteristics. However, for insights into the mechanism of movement 
dysfunction and for a guideline for remedial intervention, the evaluation for dysfluency is necessary in the 
experimental design of handwriting movement control. To explore these questions, researches on motor 
control of handwriting movement in children with handwriting difficulty, are indeed necessary.  
  Based on literature reviews on computerized handwriting evaluation and our research experience, 
parameters of great paramount significance in graphomotor function were adopted in order to evaluate the 
children with poor penmanship. The purpose of this study was to explore the characteristics of children with 
poor penmanship. The performance evaluation in regard to these parameters was measured and compared 
with those of typically developed children. However, through the above discussions, two questions have been 
raised; the first one is: what is the clinical implication of these kinematic and kinetic parameters. The second 
is: what related handwriting characteristic is determined by the values of these parameters? It is important for 
the investigation on the deterministic parameters for clinical use on the test performances of children with 
poor penmanship.  
 
Methods  
Recruitment Procedure 
For the consideration of limited time and financial resource, the reference norm was first constructed in 
southern Taiwan. A total of 546 elementary schoolchildren in grade 1 to grade 2 were recruited to gather a 
numerous data of handwriting performance of computerized test. The children were randomly recruited from 
ten to twelve elementary schools in Kaohsiung County and City. Children were excluded from this study if 
they are reported a history of any medical, neurological or pervasive developmental disorders, intellectual 
disability, oncological, musculoskeletal, sensory (hearing, vision) or skin disorders. children met the screening 
 6
in contact with its surface or within 10 mm of its surface. The pen used in this study is of a size and 
weight similar to that of pens typically used by children of this age (length = 150 mm, circumference = 
35mm, weight = 11gm). Due to the portability of the digitizing tablet and a notebook computer, all these 
measures were employed in the child’s natural classroom environment without interference from other 
persons. 
 
(2) Handwriting Tasks 
For measuring near- and far-point copy tests, an A4-sized paper was placed on the digital tablet. In an 
arrangement of 5 rows and 5 columns (25 grid cells), every grid cell had a size of 18*18 mm. The task: 
short paragraph copy was performed on an A4-sized sheet in an arrangement of 10 columns with a width 
of 18 mm. The subjects were instructed to copy the testing task on the test sheet from the right top. They 
were told that they should write as fast and correctly as possible. The task was constrained in time for 2 
min in near- and far-point copy tasks and 5 min in short paragraph copy. The examiner gave instructions 
and monitored the practice process. After confirmation that the child knew how to proceed, the 
measurement started. The whole process was recorded and the data were saved into a computer hard disk 
for further offline analysis. 
 
(3) Measuring Parameters of Computerized Analysis 
After surveying the results of related researches and the results and experiences of our previous studies, 
the following parameters were chosen for the evaluation of the handwriting process. The parameters were 
obtained directly from the kinematic or kinetic data, or derived from the temporal or spatial data of the pen-tip 
movement. The parameters included: (1) mean stroke velocity, (2) mean axial pen tip force, (3) pause time per 
stroke, (4) number of changes of direction of velocity, (5) ratio of in-air to on-paper time, and (6) ratio of 
in-air to on-paper path length. The following are the operative definitions of the parameters processed from 
the registered coordinates and axial pen force. 
1. Mean Stroke Velocity: The stroke velocity was determined by dividing the stroke length by the elapsed 
time. The mean value was derived from the average of all the strokes in all of the written tasks.

evaluation. Multiple linear regressions were performed to find out the important parameters can 
explain the largest part of variation of chronological age. For constructing the norm for reference, 
the descriptive statistical analyses were conducted to characterize the distribution of the 
handwriting evaluation result. With the mean and standard deviation of every group, the 
distribution of the performance result can be observed and analyzed. 
 
Results  
The Results in temporal and spatial parameters  
   For constructing the norm of computerized handwriting movement analysis, 9 parameters were extracted 
and verified as deterministic parameters for indicating the development of fine movement control. Tables 2-4 
show the descriptive statistics of temporal and spatial parameters in 3 copy tests. Tables 5-7 show the 
descriptive statistics of parameters indicating speed of kinematic and kinetic development in 3 copy tests. 
Tables 8-10 show the descriptive statistics of parameters indicating disautomation of handwriting movement 
in 3 copy tests.

The Result in Derived Parameters 
Table 3 shows the mean and standard deviations of the derived temporal and kinematic parameters of the 
two groups in both grades. As depicted in Table 3, in the comparison of ratios of in-air to on-paper time 
between the two groups, significant difference was found in phonetic symbol copy (Grade 1) and short 
paragraph tasks (both graders). In the comparison between the two graders, no significant difference was 
found in any of the four copy tasks. In the comparison of ratio of in-air to on-paper path length between the 
two groups, significant difference was only found in near-point copy (both graders) and short paragraph tasks 
(Grade 2). In the comparison between the two graders, significant difference was only found in near-point 
copy. In the comparison of number of changes of direction of velocity per stroke between two groups, except 
for phonetic symbol copy, significant differences were found in the rest of the tasks in both graders; however, 
significant difference is shown between the two graders in all of the tasks.

not used in daily handwritten communication, the phonetic symbols were taught for the correct pronunciation 
of Chinese characters. In comparing the complexity of phonetic symbols with regular Chinese characters, the 
symbols with a maximum of five strokes are much simpler than the regular ones: usually with a mean stroke 
number more than 10 or even 20. Children in the earlier grades of elementary school may not be able to 
engage in a handwriting copying test. The phonetic symbol task seems to be a valid test for differentiating 
children with poor penmanship from the typically developing ones in the early school years. As the children’s 
age increases, greater complexity of the task is required to overcome the ceiling effect.  
For an ideal indicator used to differentiate handwriting problems, the value of the parameters should be 
independent in regard to the related factors such as age and task, etc. The ratio of in-air to on-paper time, and 
the ratio of in-air to on-paper path length, in short paragraph tasks showed significant differences between the 
two groups but not between the two ages. However, to a child aged 6 to 8, handwriting is a skill still in the 
developmental stage. The parameters were expected to present different features in different ages. In addition 
to the difference between groups, the parameters with discriminative validity (ex. number of changes of 
direction of velocity and pause time per stroke) were found to significantly differ between the two graders. 
The skills these parameters measured are still in the stage of development. For practically clinical application, 
the age-dependent characteristics would be taken into consideration in the adoption of parameters and the 
weighting of their scores. However some more samples from higher graders are required for making further 
inferences concerning these age-related characteristics.  
Based on the view of van Galen’s model of handwriting (van Galen, Portier, Smits-Engelsman, & 
Schomaker, 1993), the computerized parameters have been linked with the components in the performance of 
handwriting tasks. The model proposed three components in succession: the motor program, parameterization 
and regularization of the motor program, and muscular initiation, in order that the task may be performed 
(Smits-Engelsman & Van Galen, 1997). The “in air” time was thought to correspond to the time needed to 
parameterize the motor program or to initiate activity in the muscle groups needed to execute the character 
(Rosenblum & Livneh-Zirinski, 2008). For linking the other parameters with the model, the increased number 
of changes of direction of velocity and pause time per stroke in children with poor penmanship may be linked 
with the regularization of the motor program or the initiation of muscle activity in the later component.
