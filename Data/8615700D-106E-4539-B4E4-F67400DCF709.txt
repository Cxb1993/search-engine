Conventional photolithography, vacuum evaporation, lift-off, and wet etch techniques were used to form 
the desired device. The drain-source Ohmic contacts were formed on the n
+
-GaAs cap layer by 
evaporating Au/Ge/Ni metals and subsequently alloyed at 380
o
C for 20 seconds. A mesa etching process 
was used to etch the wafer into the substrate by the solution of NH4OH : H2O2 : H2O = 5 : 3 : 100 at 4℃ 
for GaAs and Al0.3Ga0.7As. The native oxide on the wafer was removed by the solution of HF: H2O = 1 : 
1. The studied device was placed in a thermal oven with O2 flow at 360℃ for 35 minutes to form a thin 
and fresh oxide layer on the surface. Finally, the evaporated Schottky contact was produced by the 
evaporation of Pd metal on the surface of the thin oxide layer. Hydrogen gas sensing signal of the studied 
device was measured by an HP 4155C semiconductor parameter analyzer. During the hydrogen gas 
adsorption and desorption measurement, the studied devices were placed in a stainless-steel reaction 
chamber with a gas flow tube and a regulating value of 500 sccm. 
III Grey Polynomial Differential Model (GPDM) 
In order to investigate the hydrogen gas sensing characteristics, a novel simulation based on the grey 
polynomial differential algorithm (GPDA) was developed. Firstly, a hydrogen gas transient response model 
was developed based on the GPM [18]. Secondly, the differences between original results (hydrogen gas 
transient response) and GPM data were found. Thirdly, a fixed point between every 200 points was added. 
This is an important countermeasure to avoid the deviation between the simulated and experimental results. 
The final GPDM simulated curve keeps the features of the original curve. The error rate of the simulated 
curve is only of 0. 091%.  
 
3. 結果與討論   
Figure 2 shows the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the studies device at room temperature 
measured in air and under the hydrogen gases with varied concentration of 15 and 500 ppm H2/air, 
respectively. All I-V curves reveal good pinch-off, cut-off, and saturation characteristics. Upon exposing 
hydrogen gas, the drain current is increased in proportion to the hydrogen concentration. The current variation 
is due to the lowering effect of effective Schottky barrier height [19]. The hydrogen adsorption mechanism 
can be interpreted as follows. The hydrogen molecules are dissociated into hydrogen atoms by the Pd metal. 
Then, they quickly diffuse through the Pd metal and a dipole layer will be formed at the interface between the 
oxide layer and semiconductor. The electrical field which is caused by the dipole layer is against with the 
built-in electrical field of the studied device. Hence, the effective Schottky barrier height will be reduced [20, 
21]. In addition, the large current variation can be attributed to the amplification behavior of the studied FET 
device.  
The relationships between hydrogen multiple rate (MR) and temperature under different hydrogen 
concentration are shown in Fig. 3. The operating temperature ranges from 300 to 400K. The applied voltage is 
fixed at 1V. The MR is defined here as:  
air
H
R
I
I
M 2        (1) 
where 
2H
I  and airI  represent the currents in hydrogen-containing ambiance and in air, respectively. As 
shown in Fig. 3, MR, is reduced with the increase of operating temperature. The MR values at 400K are 1.66 
and 1.03 for the hydrogen gas concentration of 10000 and 15 ppm H2/air, respectively. Obviously, the MR is 
 6 
the randomness in measured hydrogen sensing data is reduced. When the GPM model of hydrogen gas is 
employed, a new approach for reducing the complexity of hydrogen sensing data could be obtained. The 
variation of hydrogen sensing characteristics could be founded by subtracting these two sets of data as shown 
in Fig. 5. Hence the change extracted by the GPM is obtained. In order to retain the features of hydrogen 
transient response curve, every interval 200 points will add a fixed point. Finally, the GPDM is developed. 
Obviously, the same feature of these two curves is found. However, the amount of data is reduced from 4000 
points to 68 points. In order to compare the hydrogen sensing data (original) with the sample (simulated) data, 
the mean relative error rate, MRE is introduced as [17]:  
(%)
1
(%) 


gas
gpmgas
m
mm
n
MRE         (6) 
where n is the number of data sets, mgas and mgpm the data of hydrogen sensing and GPM model output. In this 
case, MRE(%) is only of 0.091%. This result show the sample data is in a good agreement with the 
experimental hydrogen sensing results. Figure 6 demonstrate the overlapping feature of these two data sets. 
Clearly, the GPDM data well matches the experimental results with extremely high sample reduction rate of 
98.3% ((4000-68)/4000).          
 
V Conclusion 
In summary, a Pd/AlGaAs FET-based hydrogen sensor is fabricated and studied in this paper. The 
studied device exhibits significantly wide operating temperature regimes. Even at 300K and low ydrogen 
concentration of 15ppm H2/air, the remarkable hydrogen gas detection could still be observed. In 
addition, a novel GPDM is proposed and applied to reduce the computational complexity in performance 
simulation. This is very important for commercial application. The simulated results for a 500 ppm 
H2/air gas indicate the good accuracy of GPDM. The proposed GPDM approach needs to compute only 
few points to characterize the features of hydrogen transient response. Therefore, the proposed GPDM 
method shows the promise to simulate and analyze high-performance hydrogen gas sensing 
characteristics.

Abstract 
In this paper, a hydrogen sensing system with portable, low power and early warning function has been 
fabricated. The hydrogen sensing system includes a hydrogen sensor, temperature / humidity sensors, 
digital / analog converter and microcontroller. Hydrogen sensor can detection hydrogen gas which 
range is between ppm to %.  The hydrogen concentrations in digital form are showed on the LCD 
display. The key advantage of this hydrogen sensing system can be operated at room temperature. 
Another important advantage of the hydrogen sensing system is that the required time of hydrogen 
concentration detection is in 4 Seconds. Furthermore, the dangerous message can be transmitted to the 
users through the short message service (SMS).

1. Introduction 
 Recently, many kinds of alternative energy are receiving attention due to gradual depletion of oil. 
Among them, hydrogen is the most abundant gas in the universe. Also, hydrogen is a clean, efficient 
and renewable energy source. hydrogen gas has been widely used in the industrial and medical 
applications as raw material and other purposes. However, hydrogen is a flammable, colorless and 
odorless gas. When hydrogen concentrations ranging from 4-75% in air, there is a risk of explosion. 
Therefore, the development of high performance hydrogen sensor is an important demand.  
 Recently, due to the rapid advance in fabrication and growth technologies, hydrogen sensors 
based on the catalytic metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) structure have become attractive device. The 
fundamental mechanism is the adsorption of H2 gas by the catalytic metal. Part of the H2 molecules 
dissociate into H atoms and diffuse through the catalytic metal and then located at the interface 
between the metal and oxide, and a dipole layer is formed. This dipole layer will cause the change of 
electric field across the catalytic metal. Also, the characteristics of device will be changed due to the 
variation of Schottky barrier height [1].   
 Another pattern of researching is to integrate the hydrogen sensor based on semiconductor with 
sensing circuit to realize the hydrogen sensing system. In recent years, many studies of hydrogen 
area were 150 Å  and 1.4×102 μm2, respectively. The Ohmic contact formed by evaporating Ti/Al 
metals. Figure 2(b) illustrated the resistance equivalent circuit diagram of  studied semiconductor 
based hydrogen sensor. The drain, source and channel resistance are expressed as RD,  Rs, and Rch, 
respectively . When the hydrogen gas reached the surface of Pd catalytic metal and formed a dipole 
layer at the interface between metal and oxide, the channel resistance change. The channel resistance 
can be expressed as Eq. (1). 
    
  
              
          
  where μ is the mobility of In0.15Ga0.85As channel, Cox is the oxide capacitance. W is the gate width, 
L is the gate length and Vt is threshold voltage of transistor. The value of Rch will change due to the 
various of oxide capacitance and threshold voltage as exposing in hydrogen gas environment.

3 Results and Discussion 
  In this study, a new hydrogen sensing system with 9cm length and 8cm width was realized. Our 
studied hydrogen sensing system can be operated both at DC of AC voltage source. It is important for 
commerical operation. The measured curves of hydrogen gas, temperature, humid and related database 
were shown on Fig.3. 
  Figure 4 shows the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of studied hydrogen sensor exposed to air 
and to hydrogen concentration of 15 and 1000 ppm H2/air, respectively, at 30℃. The change of sensing 
current with different hydrogen concentrations are obtained. The channel resistance reduce with 
increasing the hydrogen concentration.  
 Fast response is an indispensable factor for an excellent hydrogen sensor. The chemical reactions 
involving hydrogen and oxygen gases occurring on the Pd metal surface will affect the response. The 
typical hydrogen current-response curve upon the introduction of 500, 1000, and 10000 ppm H2/air at 
30℃ are shown in Fig. 5. The applied voltage are kept at VGS=-0.3V, and VDS=1.2V. All of the response

4. Conclusion 
  In this studied, a new hydrogen sensing system, including a hydrogen sensor based on 
metal-oxide-semiconductor structure, signal process circuit, microcontroller, and bluetooth  
module, was realized. A new and fast calculate method of hydrogen concentration was proposed. The 
required time is only 4 seconds. Furthermore, the detecting data can be transmission to server and user 
for monitoring and analysis. Hence, our studied system is suitable for real-time hydrogen detector.
