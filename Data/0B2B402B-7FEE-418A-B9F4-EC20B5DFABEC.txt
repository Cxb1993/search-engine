Abstract (Keywords: Millimeter-wave, 
system on package, CMOS, thin-film) 
In this study, the integration of 
semiconductor and thin-film process 
technology will be investigated so as to realize 
the millimeter-wave system-on-package 
design, such that the advantages of circuit size 
reduction, performance enhancement, design 
cycle reduction, and cost minimization of 
millimeter-wave communication system can 
be achieved. First, based on the advanced 
CMOS process technology, novel miniature 
Si-based transmission line structure is 
designed and investigated both theoretically 
and experimentally. Then, the high-frequency 
performance of thin-film process technology 
will be studied through the design of a novel 
millimeter-wave CPW bandpass filter. 
Suitable equivalent-circuit models and design 
equations will also be established as effective 
design tools. Finally, by exploring the 
performance of each technology, the best 
process combination for millimeter-wave 
system-on- package design will be addressed. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
前言、研究目的、文獻探討 
Driven by the demand for small-size and 
lightweight mobile communication apparatus, 
there is an increasing interest in developing 
miniature microwave and millimeter-wave 
front-end modules. Recent advances in 
integration technology and device 
performance have enabled the development of 
system integration on chip (SOC) or on 
package (SOP), such that further size 
reduction of microwave or millimeter-wave 
front-end can be achieved. A complete radio 
front-end for mobile communication system 
includes several blocks, such as the 
transceiver IC, power amplifier, antenna 
front-end module, control circuitry, and 
impedance matching components. The 
electrical specifications for each block dictate 
the technology to achieve the stringent system 
 4
transmission-line equivalent. It is realized 
using the 0.18um 1P6M CMOS process 
technology. Herein the symmetrical planar 
spiral structure formed on metal layers M5 
and M6 is used to realize the two series 
inductors Ls in Fig. 1. Note that the 
orientations of the two spiral inductors for 
realizing Ls are the same such that a positive 
mutual inductance is established between 
them. The line width, spacing, and shape of 
the symmetrical planar spiral structure are 
properly designed such that the required 
mutual inductance Lm and mutual capacitance 
Cp are achieved simultaneously with 
minimum errors. The shunt capacitor Cs in  
Fig. 1 is realized by the metal-oxide-metal 
structure using the M6, M5, and the thin oxide 
layer in between. The chip photograph is 
shown in Fig. 3. 
 
Shown in Fig. 4 are the measured and 
simulated results for the proposed 
transmission-line equivalent designed with a 
characteristic impedance of 50ohm and an 
electrical length of λ/4 at 5GHz. The required 
element values are obtained by the equations 
in [18] as follows: Ls = 0.878nH, Lm = 
0.372nH, Cs = 1pF, and Cp = 0.1pF. The initial 
values of the geometrical parameters are first 
obtained by the analytical formulas and are 
then fine-tuned in the quasi-static EM 
simulator Ansoft Q3D. A full-wave simulation 
using Ansoft HFSS is then applied to examine 
the response of the whole circuit, and some 
final fine-tuning is made. The measured 
insertion loss is 1.3dB at 5GHz, and is less 
than 2.5dB up to 10GHz. The return loss is 
greater than 15dB up to 8GHz. The measured 
phase of S21 is 90o at 5 GHz. Good agreement 
between measured and simulated results is 
observed. The loss of proposed 
transmission-line equivalent is about 5dB/λg 
at 5GHz, which is comparable to those of the 
transmission lines based on CMOS-graded 
silicon in [14]-[15]. Note that the circuit area 
occupies by this lumped-element 
transmission-line equivalent is only 
210um×299um, or 0.00836λg×0.012λg at 
5GHz, without the input and output GSG 
probing pads.  
The characteristic impedance and 
propagation constant of the transmission-line 
equivalent may be evaluated from the 
S-parameters using the formulas in [20]. 
Shown in Fig. 5 are the equivalent 
characteristic impedance and normalized 
propagation constant of proposed Si-based 
lumped-element transmission-line equivalent 
in Fig. 2. The real part of equivalent 
characteristic impedance is around 54 ohm 
below 5 GHz. The deviation of measured 
characteristic impedance from the designed 
value of 50 ohm is because when designing 
the symmetrical planar spiral structure, it is 
hard to match the Ls, Lm and Cp precisely at 
the same time. The imaginary part of the 
characteristic impedance is positive, 
indicating that the total loss is mainly 
contributed by the dielectric loss. Therefore, if 
the total thickness of the oxide layers above 
the Si substrate can be increased, the loss of 
the proposed Si-based lumped-element 
transmission-line equivalent in Fig. 2 may be 
decreased. 
For the calculation of equivalent 
propagation constant, the total length of the 
symmetrical planar spiral structure is used. 
Note that a high slow-wave-factor of around 5 
is observed. This implies the proposed 
Si-based lumped-element transmission-line 
equivalent may achieve a very compact circuit 
size when applied to the design of 
transmission-line based microwave passive 
components. The Q-factor of the 
transmission-line equivalent is evaluated by Q 
= β / (2α). The measured Q-factor at 5GHz is 
5.9, which is comparable to the typical values 
of resonators realized in standard CMOS and 
is slightly better than the result in [13] that is 
based on complementary-conducting- strip 
transmission line. 
Compare to the conventional lumped- 
element transmission line designs using the T- 
or π-equivalent networks, the proposed one 
may achieve about the same circuit area but 
much wider bandwidth. This is because the 
required Lm and Cp in the modified-T model 
are conveniently realized by the proper layout 
of the two spiral inductor Ls, such that no 
additional circuit areas are required compared 
to the conventional T-equivalent network. The 
bandwidth of proposed lumped-element

III. CONCLUSION 
結論與建議 
In this study, the feasibility of CMOS and 
thin-film process for millimeter-wave system 
on package has been investigated. Novel 
Si-based lumped-element transmission-line 
equivalent based on the standard 0.18um 
CMOS process and novel millimeter-wave 
CPW bandpass filter based on the thin-film 
process have been proposed to study the high 
frequency characteristics of these two 
fabrication process. Through the proper 
combination of these two process technologies, 
one may optimize the circuit size and 
performance of millimeter-wave system on 
package module.
