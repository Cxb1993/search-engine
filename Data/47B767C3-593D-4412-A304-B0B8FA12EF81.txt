Abstract 
 
By lower Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) compared with Orthogonal Frequency 
Division Multiple Access, the Single Carrier – Frequency Division Multiple Access 
(SC-FDMA) is adopted by 3GPP to uplink of LTE system. By the adjacent sub-carrier 
allocation restriction, SC-FDMA achieves low PAPR, but degrades the flexibility in resource 
allocation at the same time. How to efficiently allocate radio resource in SC-FDMA 
multiple-access scheme has been a critical issue to be addressed. Many previous literatures 
discussed the issue from the aspects of fairness, throughput and etc. Fewer literatures had 
discussed the issue from user satisfaction aspect. In this paper, we propose a scheduling 
algorithm that stands at the side of user satisfaction. The simulation results shows that the 
proposed algorithm not only obtains great user satisfaction degree but also achieve high fairness 
between subscribers no matter what the desired uplink transmission rates between subscribers 
are the same or not.  
 
Keywords: User Satisfaction-based, SC-FDMA, Scheduling, LTE. 
 
 
1.  INTRODUCTION 
The 3GPP Long-Term Evolution (LTE) is one of the major 
candidates of the fourth generation (4G) wireless communication 
technologies. When evolving toward the new generation, LTE 
adopts the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) 
which is inherently robust to time dispersion as the downlink 
multiple-access scheme [1]. However, because of high 
Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR), OFDM is not suitable for the 
uplink radio transmission. For most of mobile terminals are 
battery-powered based, when considering the life time, they transmit 
radio signals in uplink with transmission power significantly lower 
than the base stations do in downlink. Rather than the amount of 
processing power, enabling high power efficiency in transmission is 
an important factor to overcome the difficulty. Thus, Single Carrier 
Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) is adopted in 
uplink of LTE systems. 
However, to degrade the PAPR values, SC-FDMA allocates 
continuous Resource Blocks (RB) to each subscriber [2]. The 
adjacent sub-carrier restriction considerably degrades the flexibility 
in radio resource allocation. Thus, how to allocate radio resource in 
an efficient manner is more difficult. Previous literatures had paid 
much attention in this issue. I. C. Wong and et al. focused on the 
fairness aspect to investigate the resource allocation problem [2]. L. 
Ruiz de Temino and et al. took channel conditions into account and 
proposed a channel-aware algorithm to achieve fairness between 
subscribers [3]. Though different algorithms were proposed, the 
fairness is the most important metric being investigated. F. R. M. 
Lima and et al. focused their attention on user satisfaction while 
considering the resource allocation [4]. However, the scheduling 
algorithm was focused on the Orthogonal Frequency Division 
Multiple Access (OFDMA) systems. For SC-FDMA scheme, the 
techniques developed for OFDMA cannot be directly applied due to 
the sub-carrier adjacency restriction. U. Toseef and et al. provided a 
framework to solve the resource allocation problem based on user 
satisfaction [5]. They studied the problem stood on higher layers 
rather than solving the MAC layer resource allocation. They cannot 
address the problem coming alone with SC-FDMA multiple access 
scheme. 
In this paper, we proposed a scheduling algorithm to discuss the 
resource allocation problem coming alone with SC-FDMA scheme 
in uplink of LTE systems. The proposed algorithm focuses on the 
aspect of user satisfaction. Though user satisfaction is the major 
topic concerned in the proposed algorithm, the algorithm can exhibit 
great performance in fairness as well. The rest of the paper is 
organized as follows: Section 2 is the problem formulation 
addressing our proposed algorithm to the resource allocation in 
SC-FDMA multiple access scheme. Section 3 is organized by 
simulation scenarios and result discussion. Finally, in section 4, the 
conclusion is provided. 
2.  PROBLEM FORMULATION 
2.1. Single Carrier – Frequency Division Multiple Access 
Though, the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) 
has many advantages refer to the Single Carrier – Frequency 
Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA), 3GPP adopts the SC-FDMA 
rather than the OFDM as the multiple access solution to the uplink 
direction of LTE systems in view of the Peak-to-Average Power 
Ratio (PAPR) performance. The 3GPP mainly studies two types of 
SC-FDMA implementation, the Interleaved Frequency Division 
Multiple Access (IFDMA) and Discrete Fourier Transform-Spread 
OFDMA (DFT-S-FDMA), respectively.  
The IFDMA inherits advantages from both the Frequency Division 
Multiple Access (FDMA) and the Code Division Multiple Access 
(CDMA) schemes. Referring to multi-carrier technologies, the 
IFDMA keeps lower PAPR values, which is a feature of the single 
carrier system. In the frequency-selective fading channel, the 
IFDMA provides frequency diversity gain to subscribers. In addition, 
it considerably degrades the Multiple Access Interference (MAI) and 
increase the system capacity at the same time.

3.  SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
3.1. Wireless Transmission Environment and Model 
Wireless transmission environment significantly influences the 
performance of a wireless communication system. The radio signal 
mainly suffers path loss, shadow effect, noise, and etc. while it 
traverses from a transmitter to a receiver. To evaluate the 
performance of our proposed USB algorithm, the simulation must 
have specific transmission environment or channel conditions to be 
addressed. 
(a). Path loss: when a signal traverses from a transmitter to a 
receiver, the average receiving power degrades along with the 
propagation distance. Many channel models have been 
proposed to estimate the power loss and the received average 
power corresponding to distinct transmission frequencies and 
distance. The simulation of this paper invokes WINNER II 
channel model with CINLOS environment to estimate the 
path loss: 
 )5(log2061.39)(log74.35),( 1010
fdfdPl ++=  (2) 
In Eq. (2), d  denotes propagation distance while f denotes 
the central frequency of the signal. 
(b). Channel capacity: this paper invokes the Shannon Capacity 
theorem to estimate the channel capacity. In addition, it 
introduces the SNR gap to modify the original theorem: 
 ). 5.1
5ln(for    ,)]1([log ,2 ne
PSNRBC −=+= γγ  (3) 
In Eq. (3), γ denotes the SNR gap while neP , denotes the 
target bit error rate. Moreover, in the specification of LTE 
release 8 and later, LTE can support up to 64QAM 
modulation coding scheme in uplink. Thus, 
6)1(log2 ≤+ γSNR is possible. 
3.2. Performance Metrics

3.4. Case study 
3.4.1. Case I: Subscribers desire equal uplink transmission rates 
In this case, the simulation considers that each subscriber desires 2 
Mbps uplink bandwidth for their applications. The measured metrics 
are system throughput, average USI, and fairness.  
 
Fig. 2 Relationship between system throughput and numbers of subscribers 
with each subscriber requiring 2 Mbps transmission rate 
 
As Fig. 2 shown, RME has the most system throughput than that of 
others. The result comes from the “greedy” feature of the RME 
algorithm which allocates the radio resource to the corresponding 
subscriber with the best channel condition. Because of the multi-user 
diversity gain, the system throughput gets increasing along with the 
increasing subscribers. The more subscribers the system 
accommodates, the more flexibility in radio resource assignment the 
system has. In this condition, the proposed USB algorithm consumes 
more resources than the RME and MEG algorithms do to fine tune

algorithms are exhibit a degrading fairness performance when the 
desired rate differentiation gets increasing, the proposed USB has 
outstanding performance than the others do in all test situations.

4.  CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, a scheduling algorithm which focuses on the user 
satisfaction aspect is proposed. Simulation results illustrates that the 
proposed algorithm can achieve outstanding performance in user 
satisfaction aspect compared with other two scheduling algorithms, 
RME and MEG, no matter the desired bit rates between subscribers 
are the same or not. In addition, the proposed algorithm also 
demonstrates great fairness rather than the others. For SC-FDMA 
multiple access scheme, the proposed has significant improvement 
in user satisfaction degree.
