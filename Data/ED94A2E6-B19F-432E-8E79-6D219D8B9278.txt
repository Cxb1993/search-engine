Abstract 
TiO2 nanowires having pure anatase and diameters less than 100 nm have been 
synthesized using appropriate catalysts and a radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputter 
deposition technique.  The preparation and catalysts and the sputter deposition were all 
performed at room temperature.  Catalyst-seeded substrates were placed in a RF 
magnetron sputter deposition chamber for the deposition of TiO2.  The growth of TiO2 
was carried out in the mixed Ar+O2 and Ar+N2 atmosphere.  The morphologies of the 
obtained TiO2 nanowires were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  
The electronic structures were investigated by X-ray absorption near-edge structures 
(XANES) spectroscopy.  The chemical compositions were analyzed using X-ray 
photoelectron spectra (XPS) analysis.  The luminescence properties were examined using 
cathodolumnescience (CL) spectroscopy.  We show that the oxidation state of titanium 
and the oxygen vacancies generated by ion bombardment significantly influence on the 
characteristics of the resulting TiO2 nanowires.

magnetron sputter deposition technique.  However, it is known that TiO2 have a known 
character that they are apt to lose oxygen in some conditions and exhibit sub-oxides [14], as 
expressed in Eq. (1): 
                         222 OTiOTiO x                      (1) 
S. Petigny et al. [15] show that the oxygen vacancies associated with titanium in the lower 
oxidation states (Ti3+ and Ti2+) present on the sputtered sample surface, but this derivation 
from stoichiometry is not observed in the case of oxygen sputtering.  B.O. Aronsson et al. 
[16] also demonstrated that the oxidation of a TiO2 film in oxygen plasma results in a 
uniform and stoichiometric TiO2 surface layer of reproducible composition.   
In this paper, the TiO2 nanowires were prepared by a process involving the use of 
catalysts and an RF magnetron sputter deposition at different gas compositions.  Effects 
of gas compositions in the mixed Ar+O2 and Ar+N2 atmosphere on the electronic structure 
and luminescence properties of the resulting TiO2 nanowires were investigated.   
2.  Experimental 
As mentioned above, the growth of TiO2 nanowires involves the use of a catalyst 
seeding process and sputter deposition at room temperature.  The substrate used was 
indium-tin-oxide (ITO) glass having a sheet resistance of 10  /square.  The catalyst 
seeding was performed by dip coating ITO glass in an aqueous solution of SnCl2‧2H2O 
with the addition of NaOH, which was very basic and has a pH value of 13.07.  After the 
dip coating and drying, the precipitates on the substrate served as the catalyst.  Catalyst

operated at 10 kV accelerating voltage.  
3.  Results and Discussion 
3.1 Ar-O2 atmosphere 
The morphologies of sputter-deposited TiO2 nanowires obtained at different oxygen 
contents are shown in Fig. 1.  The substrate used was ITO glass.  The rest of the 
deposition conditions are RF power of 150 W, working pressure of 5x10-2 torr, and 
deposition time of 30 minutes.  For all of the samples, the morphologies are mostly 
consisting of a mixture of TiO2 nanowires and bundles/plates.  Some of the nanowires and 
bundles/plates appear to be short in length, due to they are embedded in the TiO2 thin film.  
Also, sometimes the nanowires and bundles/plates tend to agglomerate, leading to form the 
nanoflowers structures.  In some cases, the TiO2 bundles/plates dominate the morphology 
with small amounts of nanowires.  The TiO2 nanowires obtained at O2=0% (pure Ar), 
O2=10%, O2=30%, O2=50%, O2=70%, O2=90% and O2=100% (pure O2), have the average 
diameters of 76±16 nm, 58±18 nm, 39±7 nm, 80±13 nm, 60±12 nm, 60±14 nm and 85±19 
nm, respectively.  The correlation between the average diameter of the sputter-deposited 
TiO2 nanowires and the various oxygen contents is shown in Fig. 2.  The correction is 
very weak.  However, as will be seen in later, oxygen content does affect the other 
characteristics of the resulting TiO2.

makes no difference between O2=50% and O2=70%, as well as between O2=90% and 
O2=100%.  This result is attributed to the fact that surface oxygen vacancies often 
associated with ion bombardment during the sputter deposition process, leading to the 
change of stoichiometric TiO2 in the near-surface region.  V.S. Lusvardi et al. [18] 
demonstrated an investigation of XANES spectra for TiO2 which exhibited a peak shift 
with the increase of the oxidation state of titanium.  In other words, an L-edge peak of 
titanium shifts to higher absorption energy and a K-edge peak of oxygen shifts to the lower 
absorption energy.  Y. Kim et al. [20] demonstrated that the number of oxygen vacancies 
can be reduced in the O2-plasma treated TiO2 films.  In our case, with the increase of 
oxygen contents, the result leads to increase probability to filling the oxygen vacancies, i.e. 
increasing the oxidation state of the titanium.  Consequently, the surface of the TiO2 
nanowires becomes more stoichiometric with the introduction of oxygen contents, as 
compared to the sample obtained in pure Ar atmosphere. 
Fig. 4 gives a comparison of the O K-edge XANES spectra of the sputter-deposited 
TiO2 nanowires.  The positions of the peaks in the O K-edge XANES spectra of Fig. 4A 
are given in Table 2.  The substrate used was ITO glass.  The other deposition conditions 
are RF power=150 W, working pressure=5x10-2 torr, and deposition time=30 
 15
minutes.  The O K-edge XANES spectra were also recorded in the total electron yield 
mode (surface-sensitive) for oxygen 1s absorption.  As shown in Fig. 4A, the O K-edge 
XANES spectra for all the samples are split into two sets of peaks, between 525 and 565 
eV.  The first two main features of the spectra at ~531 and ~533 eV, labeled as A and B 
peaks, respectively, corresponding to electron transitions from the O 1s orbital to a 
covalently mixed state derived from the O 2p states hybridized with Ti 3d states.  This 
can be attributed to the excitation from O 1s core level to the t2g and eg bands as crystal 
field splits 3d levels of Ti, respectively.  Moreover, the peaks at higher energy region are 
due to the transitions to the O (2p) antibonding state and O (2p)-Ti (4sp) hybridized levels, 
labeled as C and D peaks, respectively [21].  A remarkable difference between anatase and 
rutile TiO2 phase is the spectral feature in the higher energy region.  Anatase TiO2 
exhibits two peaks, while rutile TiO2 exhibits three peaks [21].  Therefore, it is noted that 
the O K-edge XANES spectra for all the samples obtained at different oxygen contents are 
similar to that of the anatase TiO2 features, as shown in Fig. 4A.  Furthermore, the high 
energy region features (peaks C and D) at O2=0% (pure Ar) are much less distinguishable 
than those at O2=10% to O2=100% (pure O2).  This can be attributed to the lack of 
long-range ordering for the sample obtained at O2=0% (pure Ar).  The leading edge of the 
O K-edge XANES spectra located between 528.5 and 532.5 eV is shown in Fig. 4B.  As 
the oxygen contents increases from 0% to 100%, the peak of O K-edge XANES spectra 
generally shifts to the lower absorption energy, in contrast to the leading edge of the Ti

non-stoichiometric nature of sputter-deposited TiO2 nanowires surface.  Furthermore, for 
the Ti 2p3/2 sub-region, the quantitative variation of the surface stoichiometry was 
determined by calculating the fitting peak areas of Ti4+ 2p3/2 and Ti3+ 2p3/2, with respect to 
the total area of Ti 2p3/2 peak.  The results are given in Fig. 7.  The sputter-deposited 
TiO2 nanowires obtain at O2=0% (pure Ar), O2=10%, O2=30%, O2=50%, O2=70%, 
O2=90% and O2=100% (pure O2), which give the Ti4+ 2p3/2 surface chemical states of 
88.3%, 88.72%, 88.85%, 88.94%, 89.12%, 89.35% and 89.84%, in addition to give the 
Ti3+ 2p3/2 surface chemical states of 11.70%, 11.28%, 11.15%, 11.06%, 10.88%, 10.65% 
and 10.16%.  The surface Ti4+ 2p3/2 increases with the increase of oxygen contents, while 
the surface Ti3+ 2p3/2 decreases with the increase of oxygen contents.  Therefore, it 
implies that the oxygen vacancies of TiO2 nanowires surface can be filled, especially in the 
oxygen-rich environment.  The results suggest that the stoichiometric of TiO2 nanowires 
can be improved with the increase of oxygen contents.  This is in a good agreement with 
the results obtained from the Ti L2,3-edge XANES analysis (Fig. 3).

XANES analysis 
Fig. 10 compares the Ti L2,3-edge XANES spectra of sputter-deposited TiO2 
nanowires obtained at different nitrogen contents.  The positions of the peaks in the Ti 
L2,3-edge XANES spectra of Fig. 10A are summarized in Table 3.  The substrate used was 
ITO glass.  The rest of the deposition conditions are RF power of 150 W, working 
pressure of 5x10-2 torr, and deposition time of 30 minutes.  The Ti L2,3-edge XANES 
spectra for all the samples were recorded in the total electron yield mode for Ti 2p 
absorption, taking its surface sensitive advantage.  As shown in Fig. 10A, the two sets of 
peaks observed between 450 and 472 eV are the characteristics of TiO2, which are  
 27
labeled as L3 and L2 edges.  Each L edge splits into t2g and eg orbitals in octahedral 
symmetry due to the crystal field splitting, assigned as C3 (C2) and D3 (D2), E3, 
respectively.   
The Ti L2,3-edge XANES spectra in Fig. 10A for all the samples exhibit the anatase 
TiO2 features, which can be seen from the different relative intensities between D3 and E3 
peaks.  However, at either lower nitrogen contents such as N2=0% (pure Ar) and N2=10%, 
or higher nitrogen contents such as N2=90% and N2=100% (pure N2), the shoulder of eg 
band in L3 edge (E3 peak) becomes less resolved, which are attributed to the obtained TiO2 
nanowires lack the long-range ordering structures under these circumstances.  Fig. 10B 
shows the leading edge of the Ti L2,3-edge XANES spectra, located between 455.5 and 
457.0 eV.  It is noted that as increasing the nitrogen contents from 0% to 70% in the 
mixed Ar-N2 atmosphere, the Ti L2,3-leading edge peak in general shifts to slightly higher 
absorption energy, in spite of the fact that the peak does not shift at N2=10% to N2=30%.  
In addition, as further increasing the nitrogen contents from 70% to 100%, the peak shifts 
to slightly lower absorption energy, which is close to the peak position at N2=0% (pure Ar).  
The results imply that the TiO2 nanowires surface at N2=0% (pure Ar) exhibits the 
non-stoichiometric or sub-stoichiometric nature, while with the increase of nitrogen 
contents from 0% to 70%, the oxidation state of the titanium is increased and the TiO2 
nanowires become more stoichiometric.  However, the change in the oxidation state of the 
titanium is not seen at N2=10% to N2=30%.  On the contrary, the oxidation state of the

deposited TiO2 nanowires obtained at different nitrogen contents are shown in Fig. 12 and 
13, respectively.  As shown in Fig. 12, except for the sample obtained at N2=0% (pure Ar), 
the rest of the samples in the XPS survey spectra are in the presence of a minor N 1s peak 
at the binding energy of 400.3 eV, indicating the formation of nitrogen-doped TiO2 
nanowires.  R. Asahi et al. have attributed the N 1s peak at the binding energy of 400.4 
eV to the surface molecularly absorbed nitrogen species [23].  On the other hand, the 
high-resolution XPS Ti 2p spectra (Fig. 13) for all the samples are fitted with four peaks as 
Ti4+ 2p3/2, Ti4+ 2p1/2, Ti3+ 2p3/2 and Ti3+ 2p1/2.  The presence of Ti3+ peaks indicates the 
non-stoichiometric nature of TiO2 nanowires in the near surface region, which associated 
with the creation of a number of oxygen vacancies.  In addition, the surface chemical 
states of TiO2 nanowires obtained at different nitrogen contents are examined through the 
quantitative analysis of Ti 2p3/2 region.  The results are given in Fig. 14.  The 
sputter-deposited TiO2 nanowires obtain at N2=0% (pure Ar), N2=10%, N2=30%, N2=50%, 
N2=70%, N2=90% and N2=100% (pure N2), which give the Ti4+ 2p3/2 surface chemical 
states of 88.3%, 88.83%, 88.85%, 88.91%, 89.25%, 88.44% and 88.42%, in contrast to 
give the Ti3+ 2p3/2 surface chemical states of 11.70%, 11.17%, 11.15%, 11.09%, 10.75%, 
11.56% and 11.58%.  As a result, the surface Ti4+ 2p3/2 slightly increases and gives the 
contrary result of the surface Ti3+ 2p3/2 slightly decreases, with the increase of nitrogen 
contents from 0% to 70%.  B. Liu et al. [114] reported that in a mixture of Ar-N2 
atmosphere, the nitrogen element is difficult to substitute oxygen from Ti-O groups.

3.3 Comparison of pure Ar, pure N2 and pure O2 atmosphere 
Fig. 15 gives a comparison of XPS survey spectra of sputter-deposited TiO2 
nanowires obtained in different atmosphere (pure Ar, pure N2 and pure O2).  The substrate 
used was ITO glass.  The rest of the deposition conditions are RF power of 150 W, 
working pressure of 5x10-2 torr, and deposition time of 30 minutes.  The results indicate 
for the three samples, in addition to the elements of Ti and O related core levels are 
detectable in the XPS survey spectra, the other elements of Sn and Na related core levels 
which are attributed to pH 13.07 catalysts, are detectable as well.  For the TiO2 nanowires 
obtained in pure N2 atmosphere, a minor N 1s peak at the binding energy of 400.3 eV is 
appeared, as shown in Fig. 15B.  The N 1s peak position is considered to be the 
molecularly absorbed nitrogen species, absorbing onto the surface of TiO2 nanowires and 
forming the N-doped TiO2 nanowires. 
Furthermore, the high-resolution XPS spectra of Ti 2p peak of sputter-deposited TiO2 
nanowires obtained in different atmosphere are shown in Fig. 16.  The analysis of the 
quantitative variation of different titanium surface chemical states was carried out.  As 
shown in Fig. 16A, the high-resolution of Ti 2p XPS spectrum of TiO2 nanowires obtained 
in pure Ar atmosphere, is fitted with four peaks as Ti4+ 2p3/2 at 457.3 eV, Ti3+ 2p3/2 at 456.6 
eV, Ti4+ 2p1/2 at 463.1 eV and Ti3+ 2p1/2 at 458.1 eV.  For the TiO2 nanowires obtained in 
pure N2 atmosphere, as shown in Fig. 16B, the high-resolution of Ti 2p XPS spectrum is 
fitted with four peaks as Ti4+ 2p3/2 at 457.2 eV, Ti3+ 2p3/2 at 456.5 eV,

observed.  The results suggests that the abundant oxygen species can fill the oxygen 
vacancies effectively, leading to reduce the oxygen vacancies of the TiO2 nanowires 
surface, i.e. increase the Ti4+ 2p3/2 surface chemical states. 
The supporting evidence for the XPS analysis is obtained from the XANES 
characterization, which is very sensitive to the local bonding environment, providing the 
information about the electronic structures and oxidation states of the titanium dioxides 
and sub-oxides.  Fig. 17 compares the Ti L2,3-edge XANES spectra of sputter-deposited 
TiO2 nanowires obtained in different atmosphere.  The substrate used was ITO glass.  
The rest of the deposition conditions are RF power of 150 W, working pressure of 5x10-2 
torr, and deposition time of 30 minutes.  The Ti L2,3-edge XANES spectra located 
between 450 and 472 eV, were recorded in the total electron yield mode (surface-sensitive) 
for titanium 2p absorption, as shown in Fig. 17A.  The resulting spectra are similar to the 
anatase TiO2 features for all the samples, based on the different relative intensities between 
D3 and E3 peaks.  Also, the TiO2 nanowires obtained in pure O2 atmosphere exhibit the 
long-range ordering structure owing to the much resolved shoulder of eg band (E3 peak), as 
compared to the other gas composition.  Fig. 17B shows the leading edge of the Ti 
L2,3-edge XANES spectra, located between 455.5 and 457.0 eV.  The Ti L2,3-leading edge 
peak position for the TiO2 nanowires obtained in pure Ar atmosphere is located at the 
photon energy of 456.3943 eV, relative to that obtained in pure N2 atmosphere is located at 
slightly higher photon energy of 456.39862 eV.  Moreover, the  
 43
Ti L2,3-leading edge peak shifts to the higher photon energy of 456.48255 eV for the TiO2 
nanowires obtained in pure O2 atmosphere, with reference to the peak of the other samples.  
The correction between the Ti L2,3-leading edge peak position and gas composition is 
shown in Fig. 17C.  The peak shift behavior demonstrates that the oxidation state of the 
titanium is slightly increased, with the change of the gas composition from pure Ar to pure 
N2.  In addition to vary the gas composition from pure Ar to pure O2, the oxidation state 
of the titanium increases remarkably. 
    In summary, according to the quantitative variation of Ti4+ and Ti3+ surface chemical 
states determined from the XPS analysis, as well as the peak shift behavior exhibits in the 
XANES spectra, the investigation of XPS and XANES results for all the samples is in a 
good agreement under the same circumstances.  We speculate that the TiO2 nanowires 
obtained in pure O2 atmosphere are more stoichiometric than in pure Ar and pure N2 
atmosphere, due to the existence of the surface defected states originated by the oxygen 
vacancies can be filled in an abundant oxygen gas environment; while in a nitrogen-rich 
environment, the surface absorbed nitrogen species can not effectively fill the oxygen 
vacancies.  Therefore, the stoichiometry of sputter-deposited TiO2 nanowires can be 
controlled with the use of different gas compositions in the sputtering plasma.

stoichiometric TiO2 nanowires are formed in the presence of Ti2O3 (Ti3+), due to the ions 
bombardment associated with the creation of oxygen vacancies during the sputter 
deposition process, and therefore the surface defect states of oxygen vacancies are 
contributed to the resulting CL spectra in Fig. 18.  As for the emission peak at 491-497 
nm (2.49-2.52 eV) bands of all the samples, it is also related to the formation of surface 
defects states associated with oxygen vacancies according to I. Fernández et al. [29] 
reported.  They demonstrated that the oxygen vacancy levels in TiO2 single crystals 
showed the CL emission in the visible range with a broad complex band whose maximum 
was peaked around 2.5 eV.  On the other hand, the CL emission peaks contributed by the 
oxygen vacancies have lower luminescence intensities for the TiO2 nanowires obtained in 
pure O2 atmosphere than the others, indicating that the oxygen vacancies can be reduced in 
the abundant oxygen gas environment, which is in an agreement with previous results.
