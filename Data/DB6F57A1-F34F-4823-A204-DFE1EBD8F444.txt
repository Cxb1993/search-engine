1Development of a Segment-based Polymer Cubic
Equation of State for Industrial Applications
（高分子狀態方程式的研究開發及工業界的實際應用）
Introduction and Background
To model systems typically found in refinery and chemical industries, one
of the necessary calculations is the prediction of phase equilibria. Although
van der Waals proposed his pioneering cubic equation of state in 1873, the
cubic equation of state only began to show its surprising predictive
capability of fluid phase behavior of complex non-polar systems only later in
1972, almost a century later. Before 1972, the cubic equation of state was
usually applied in the calculation of vapor phase properties while the liquid
was handled using an activity coefficient model. Since activity coefficient
models can only be used to calculate K-values for components in the liquid
phase at system conditions and may not be used for predicting other
thermodynamic properties, there has been an increasing interest to extend
equations of state to the modeling of complex liquid phase behavior.
The Soave modification of the Redlich-Kwong equation (Soave, 1972)
has been a major success in extending the applicability of cubic equations of
state (CEoS) to the prediction of vapor-liquid equilibria containing non-polar
and slightly polar components. However, the Soave type cubic equations
of state using the van der Waals mixing rules have difficulty handling the
phase behavior of polar systems. In an attempt to rectify some of these
shortcomings, numerous efforts have been carried out toward the
development of new mixing rules and new equation of state models for
associating fluids.
The modern development of combining cubic equations of state with the
excess Gibbs energy mixing rules has advanced the CEoS towards a very
effective method and become the most widely used methods in all of the
commercial process simulation in correlating and predicting phase
equilibrium behavior for highly non-ideal systems. The capability of the
advanced cubic equation of state is summarized here: it comes both from the
ability to predict pure component vapor pressure accurately for polar and
non-polar components (Soave, 1972; Twu, et al., 1991) and the latest
development of new excess Gibbs energy mixing rules for cubic equations of
3Because the accurate liquid density prediction is quite important for
polymer solutions, we will propose a rigorous, universal, but simple
volume-translation methodology to predict correctly the liquid density from
cubic equations of state without introducing any regressed parameters. The
proposed methodology without affecting the K-value calculations is
applicable to all types of cubic equation of state.
The project is scheduled for a three year period from 2007 to 2010. The
first year project starting from August 1st, 2007 was granted for a total of
$495,000 by National Science Council. During the period of the first year,
we have achieved all the items we plan to do. The followings are our
accomplishment:
(1) A paper entitled “Methodology for Predicting Water Content in
Super-critical Gas Vapor and Gas Solubility in Aqueous Phase for Natural
Gas Process” was accepted and published in a prestigious, scientific journal 
(Twu et al., Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., 2007, 46, 7253-7259).
(2) We have successfully transformed conventional cubic equation of state
to a segment-based cubic equation of state for application to polymer
systems.
(3) We have successfully developed a segment-based TST excess Gibbs
energy model for used in CEoS/AE mixing rules.
(4) We have successfully developed a rigorous, universal, but simple
volume-translation methodology for the accurate prediction of the liquid
density from cubic equations of state for chemicals without introducing any
regressed parameters. This volume-translated CEoS will be applied to the
prediction of liquid density for polar, nonpolar, and polymer solutions.
(5) As a result of the item (4), a manuscript entitled “A Rigorously
Universal Methodology of Volume Translation for Cubic Equations of
State” has been writen up.  The manuscriptis attached here as a part of the
final report for the Project No. NSC96-2221-E-165-001.

predicting liquid densities of chemicals and polymers has been designed and
implemented.

Development of a Segment-based CEoS/GE Mixing Rule
Twu, Sim and Tassone (TST) recently have developed CEoS/AE mixing
rules (Twu, et al., 2001; Twu, et al., 2002) to permit the smooth transition of
the mixing rules to the conventional van der Waals one-fluid mixing rules.
The incorporation of their proposed GE model and mixing rules into a cubic
equation of state allows the equation of state to describe both a van der
Waals fluid and highly non-ideal mixtures over a broad range of
temperatures and pressures in a consistent and unified framework.
The TST zero-pressure mixing rules for the cubic equation of state
mixture a and b parameters are:

The TST zero-pressure mixing rules assume that A0Evdw, the excess

approximated by AEvdw, the excess Helmholtz energy of van der Waals fluid
at infinite pressure
9model such as the NRTL equation can be used directly for the excess
Helmholtz free energy expression A0E in the equation. Twu et al.(2001,
2002) have proposed a multi-component equation for a liquid activity model
for use in the TST excess energy mixing rules:

Eq.(26) appears to be similar to the NRTL equation, but there is a
fundamental difference between them. NRTL assumes Aij, Aji, and ij are
the parameters of the model, but our excess Gibbs energy model assumes ij
and Gij are the binary interaction parameters. More importantly, any
appropriate temperature-dependent function can be applied to ij and Gij.
For example, to obtain the NRTL model, ij and Gij are calculated as usual
from the NRTL parameters Aij, Aji andij:

Abstract
To model systems typically found in hydrocarbon production problems
and chemical industry, there are three basic types of calculations are required:
phase equilibria, volumetric behavior, and thermophysical properties.
Since 1972, cubic equations of state (CEoS) have shown surprising
capabilities in the prediction of the phase equilibria of complex non-polar
systems. However, the prediction of the liquid volumes from cubic
equations of state, despite the recently important advances in CEoS/AE
mixing rules, still remains the weak point of this type of equations. A
rigorous, universal, but simple methodology without introducing any
regressed parameters is proposed for the volume translation for all types of
cubic equation of state. The proposed methodology applies to not only
defined components, but also petroleum fractions. The translated cubic
equations of state reproduce almost exactly the liquid density over the entire
temperature range from the triple point to the critical point.

particularly near the critical region, the prediction of liquid densities from
such equations is badly in error. This is one of the inherent limitations of
any cubic equation of state. Consequently, the major drawback of forcing
the equation-of-state parameters to fit the liquid density not only fails to
satisfy the critical constraints, but also sacrifices the ability of the prediction
of more desired K-value property from equations of state. This procedure
also leads to an over estimation of critical temperature and critical pressure.
The use of critical constraints in determining the cubic equation of state
parameters is a very unique feature for CEoS. Since most of non-cubic
equations of state are complex, it is infeasible or almost impossible to derive
analytical expressions for their parameters from critical constants. On the
other hand, the form of the cubic equation of state is simple enough to allow
its parameters to be determined analytically from critical constraints. The
critical constraints on the parameters also enhance the accuracy of the cubic
equation of state in the prediction of K-values, especially at or near the
critical point. The critical constraints, however, result in a constant value
of critical compressibility factor Zc for all components. The value of Zc of
real fluids is known from experiment to be generally smaller than that
predicted from the cubic equation of state. As a result, the predicted liquid
densities differ considerably from their experimental values. Fortunately,
the under prediction of liquid density from cubic equations of state can be
corrected by the method of volume translation without affecting any K-value
calculation.
Volume-Translated Cubic Equations of State
Since the early 1970’s, cubic equations of state quickly becamepopular as
modeling and predictive tools for natural gas systems because cubic
equations have shown remarkable abilities in the prediction of the phase
behavior of hydrocarbon fluids. To extend the use of the CEoS to the
retrograde phenomenon of hydrocarbon systems, as well as to the prediction
of the liquid fraction condensed for actual gas condensate systems, however,
it has to cope with the difficulty existing in CEoS. That is, the common
cubic equations of state do not lead to accurate results in all PVT conditions.
The introduction of a third parameter, from the translation concept (Martin,
1979), has been shown to improve significantly the accuracy of density
prediction from the cubic equations of state. Peneloux et al. (1982)

Here ZRA is the Rackett parameter and is a particular constant for the
Rackett equation. The value of ZRA is unique to each component and is
confined within a small range of certain values, typically in the range of 0.2
to 0.3. Its value is determined from the saturated liquid density data of the
component and can be found in many literatures.
vs,CEoS in eq.(3) is the saturated liquid volume calculated from any cubic
equation of state. At low pressure, the saturated liquid volumes are
adequately assumed to be independent of the pressure. The saturated liquid
volume vs,CEoS is then proposed to be solved from the cubic equation of state
by neglecting the pressure and selecting the smaller root:

The volume correction, c, in eq.(3) is considered to be the third parameter
in the two-parameter cubic equations of state. Since the linear mixing rule
is used for the cubic equation of state co-volume term b, a linear mixing rule
should also be used for the volume correction c for the calculation of
mixture volume to maintain the internal consistency with b. The predicted
mixture volume from cubic equation of state is then corrected by the mixture
volume correction term to give the desired volume, vcorrected:

The term ci in eq.(15) is the volume correction for the pure component i
calculated from eqs.(3) and (4) together with (5) for temperature up to Tb, or
with eqs.(1) and (9)-(11) for temperature between Tb and Tc or with eq.(12)
for either the temperature at or above the critical temperature or the system
at extremely high pressures.
Volume Corrections for Petroleum Fractions
The methodology proposed here, represented by eqs.(1) to (14), intends to
apply to not only defined components, but also petroleum fractions. The
conventional characterization parameters used for many years in the
petroleum refining industry are the normal boiling point (Tb) and the specific
gravity (SG). Because critical properties are generally not available for
petroleum fractions, problems arise if an undefined petroleum fraction is
included in the system. Since Tc, Pc, acentric factor (), and ZRA can all
enter into the volume translation calculations, special care must be given to
properly characterize the petroleum fraction to maintain the internal
consistency.
21
volume correction is a constant for individual component, the volume
representation is not satisfactory for the heavy components or petroleum
fractions, and the volume correction is inappropriate for polar components.
It will be interesting to compare the Peneloux volume correction, eq.(16),
with our rigorous equation for the volume correction, eqs.(3), (4) and (5).
If the same reference temperature as that chosen by Peneloux is selected, our
volume correction, eq.(3) becomes

indicate that the liquid densities of these two components in DIPPR
databank are inconsistent with others. Therefore, the results for these two
components are for reference only.
Examining the accuracy of reproducing liquid density as shown in Table 1,
it was found that the Peneloux procedure is quite effective in correcting
volume for temperature up to Tr=0.7. However, it is evident from the result
given in Table 1 showing that Peneloux correlation produces the largest
deviation for methane. As mentioned previously, since Peneloux used
ethane as the reference in volume translation, it was really surprised to find
that the Peneloux exhibits larger deviation for light components than heavy
ones. The same trend of deviation is also found by eq.(18) at Tr=0.7. On
the other hand, using another reference temperature at Tb such as eq.(13), the
results reverse the trend of deviation to give the larger deviation for heavy
components. This seems to indicate that the accuracy depends primarily on
the selected reference temperature, not the reference component. It is
interesting to find out that both of our methods eq.(24) at Tr=0.5 and eq.(23)
at Tr=0.6 are more appropriate than the Peneloux in correcting the liquid
volume prediction from the cubic equation of state.  Finaly, the ‘Twu’ 
method consistently gives the most accurate results for all cases over the
entire range of temperatures.
Since Peneloux correlation is based on a fixed value of a*/b*=8.58 of
ethane, the discrepancy between measured and calculated liquid densities
apart from this fixed value can not be removed and becomes worse
especially when temperature progresses to higher values than Tb. The
results shown in Table 2 demonstrate this weakness that the deviation
increases significantly when the density data of temperature higher than Tb
are included.
It is worth mentioning that the equation 16 proposed by Peneloux for the
volume correction is proper only for SRK equation of state, inappropriate for
use in any other cubic equations of state. Since our method is general for
any cubic equation of state, the Peneloux-type volume correction for TST
(Twu-Sim-Tassone) cubic equation of state can be derived directly from our
eq.(18) without the need of applying the procedures described by Peneloux.
The TST cubic equation of state was developed by Twu et al.(2002a) to
allow better prediction of liquid densities for heavy hydrocarbons and polar
components as well as the accurate prediction of vapor pressure of all

Conclusion
We have developed a rigorous, universal, but simple methodology for the
volume translation to remove the inherent limitations of the under prediction
of liquid density from any cubic equations of state. The translated cubic
equations of state reproduce accurately the liquid density over the entire
temperature range from the triple point to the critical point. The proposed
methodology can be applied to not only the defined components, but also the
petroleum fractions. Our recent efforts toward the development of unified
CEoS/AE mixing rule (Twu et al., 2001, 2002b) and the Twu alpha function
(Twu et al., 1991) for highly non-ideal systems in predicting vapor-liquid
equilibria (VLE) have been highly successful. The development of the
volume translation in this work extends the cubic equation of state further to
be able to predict accurately the liquid density for non-polar, polar and
polymer systems, in addition to phase equilibrium behavior.
