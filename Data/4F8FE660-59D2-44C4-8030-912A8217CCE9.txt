Abstract 
We have successfully made composite skin scaffolds that have a porous dermal layer made by freeze-drying 
and a nanofibrous epidermal layer made by electrospinning. The materials that were used to make the 
composite scaffolds were chitosan (CS) and pectin-crosslinked chitosan (PEC). The SEM micrographs 
showed that the two layers in the scaffolds were integrated and inseparable. Both CS and PEC electrospun 
layers had similar fiber size (135 nm) and size distribution. CS nanofibers retained its morphology in saline 
solution better than PEC nanofibers after 10 days. PEC composite scaffolds had higher swelling ratio in 24 
hours and higher Young’s modulus, tensile stress, and strain at break, than CS composite scaffolds. In vitro 
tests showed that both CS and PEC promoted growth and type I collagen secretion in fibroblasts.

摘要 
我們已經成功地製出雙層複合式皮膚支架。此支架具有由冷凍乾燥法製做之多孔狀的真皮層，和由電
紡製做之奈米纖維的表皮細胞層。使用來製造複合支架的材料為幾丁聚醣（CS）和果膠交聯過之幾丁
聚醣（PEC）。 SEM 照片顯示，支架的不同層緊密的結合在一起。 CS 和 PEC 電紡層的纖維大小很接
近（約 135 奈米），纖維直徑分佈也相似。 在經過 10 天的食鹽水浸泡後，相較於 PEC 的纖維，CS 保
持較完整的纖維形態。24 小時內，PEC 複合支架的膨潤率較 CS 高。PEC 複合支架的楊氏模量，拉伸
應力，和斷裂應變均比 CS 複合支架高。體外細胞試驗顯示，CS 和 PEC 複合支架均可有效促進纖維母
細胞的增長和 I 型膠原蛋白的分泌。

(n=4, dimensions: 5 cm x 1 cm; gauge length= 3 cm) were fixed between the two clamps of an universal 
micro-tribometer (UMT-2, CETR, USA). The crosshead traveled at 1 mm/min [21]. Young’s modulus (MPa), 
stain at break (%), and ultimate tensile strength (MPa) were obtained according to the regulations in [22].  
Swelling ratio  
Samples were cut into pieces approximately 2 cm x 2 cm (n=6), and their dry weights were measured (W0). 
They were soaked in PBS and removed at designated times between 0 and 60 minutes. After being removed 
from PBS, the excess liquid on the samples was removed before they were weighed again (WF). The swelling 
ratio was calculated as (WF-W0)/W0 x 100%.   
Degradation 
Samples (n=3) were submerged in PBS for 5, 10, and 15 days before they were rinsed in deionized water 
and dehydrated with ethanol solutions from low to high concentrations (10% to 99.5%). The morphology of 
the samples were observed using SEM with the procedure described in section 2.2.  
Cell culture  
Fibroblast cells (L929, ATCC, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) with 
10% fetal bovine serum, 100U/mL penicillin, and 100μg/mL streptomycin (all cell culture supplies were 
purchased from Invitrogen, CA, USA). They were maintained in a CO2 incubator (SCA-165DS, ASTEC, 
Japan) at 37°C with 95% humidity and 5% CO2. Electrospun samples for cell tests were punched into circles 
(D=14 mm) that could fit into the wells of a 24-well tissue culture plate. They were washed in 70% ethanol 
solution and PBS (containing 500U/mL penicillin and 500μg/mL streptomycin) copious times before being 
exposed to UV light overnight. The samples were then rinsed with sterile PBS and DMEM before cell 
seeding.  
Cell proliferation and viability 
2 x 104 cells were seeded on the sample in each well of a 24-well culture plate and cultured for 10 days. 
On day 1, 4, 7, and 10, the total amount of double strain DNA (dsDNA) (n=6) and the viability (n=6) of the 
cells were measured.  
To measure the total dsDNA, each sample was digested in 1 mL of 1% papain solution (0.1w/v% papain 
in 0.1M Na2HPO4 + 5mM Na2EDTA, pH=6) at 55oC for one hour. The DNA content in the digest was then 
measured using a commercial kit (Quant-iTTM PicoGreen, Invitrogen, CA). A luminescence spectrometer (LS 
55, PerkinElmer Instruments, MA) was used to read the fluorescent intensity (Ex/Em=480/530nm) of the cell 
digest. The intensity was converted to total DNA concentration (μg/mL) using a standard curve. 
For the viability test, 312.5 μL of 1mg/ml of MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- 
diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (Sigma, MO, USA) solution was added to each well. Four hours later, the MTT 
solution was removed, and 625 μL of isopropanol was added to each well. The absorbance (A570) of the 
isopropanol solution was read at 570 nm using a spectrophotometer.  
Type I collagen production  
The amount of type I collagen secreted in ECM was measured in this test using SircolTM Collagen Assay 
(Biocolor, UK) following the manufacturer’s instructions (n=6). In brief, 1 mL of 0.5 M acetic acid with 0.1 
mg/mL pepsin (Sigma, MO) was added to each sample and kept at 4oC overnight. The acidic extract was 
moved to a microcentrifuge tube, and 100 μL Acid Neutralizing Reagent and 200 μL Isolation & 
Concentration Reagent was then added to it. The mixture was incubated overnight at 4°C, and the tube was 
centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and 1 mL of Sircol Dye Reagent was 
added to the precipitation. The content was gently mixed for 30 min., and the tube was spun at 12000 rpm for 
10 min. The supernatant was removed and the pellet and inside of the tube were rinsed with 750 μl Acid-Salt 
Wash Reagent. The tube was centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 min., and all the liquid was removed. 250 μl of 
Alkali Reagent was added to the tube and it was vortexed for 5 min. before the absorbance of the liquid was 
read at 555 nm.    
Cell morphology 
Cells grown on the samples, after 4, 7, and 10 days, were removed from the culture plates and rinsed 
with PBS three times. They were crosslinked in 2.5% glutaldehyde/PBS solution for 30 minutes, rinsed with 
PBS and dehydrated in ethanol solutions from low to high concentrations. Hexamethyldisilazane (Sigma) was 
used to remove residual ethanol on the samples before they were air dried. Specimens were sputter-coated 
with gold before being examined by SEM.

Swelling Ratios 
The swelling ratios of the two composite scaffolds are shown in Figure 4. Due to pectin crosslinking, 
PEC composite scaffolds were unable to take up as much water as CS composite scaffolds. Pectin- 
crosslinked chitosan is more wettable than chitosan alone [23] and hence reached 90% of its max swelling 
ratio faster than chitosan. CS and PEC composites reached 90% of their maximum swelling ratio in less than 
20 min and 5 min respectively.

Fibroblast Cell Proliferation, Viability, and Type I Collagen Production on The Electrospun Layers 
The cells on both cs and pec nanofibers grew over 10 days of culture period and showed significant 
higher amount of DNA compared to cells grew on tissue culture polystyrene (TCP) (Figure 6 (a)). Their 
viability also showed similar trends (Figure 6 (b)). The fibroblast cells on the electrospun layers also produced 
more type I collagen in the extracellular matrix (ECM) than the cells on TCP (Figure 7).
