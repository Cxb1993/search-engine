simulations. Results show that present model can 
exactly reduce to traditional MSE while there is no 
viscosity in the fluid. Transmission coefficients of 
present model also show a same tendency with 
numerical experiment data when viscosity is 
considered. In addition, transmission   coefficients 
decay with the decrease of wave length because of 
viscosity effects. 
In this project, we continue to extend present model 
to be available for real 3D wave problems. The 
validation of present model would be carried out by 
IEMM method as well. Furthermore, we will participant 
international conferences and publish those efforts 
in international papers.

二、研究目的與文獻探討 
 The combined effects of wave refraction 
and diffraction on the wave transformation can 
be described by using the mild-slope equation 
(MSE) that was first derived by Berkhoff 1. 
Notably, the MSE is a 2-D equation which 
simplifies the linear scattering of surface waves 
on varying water depth by averaging their 
motion over the depth. The MSE can efficiently 
be employed to predict linear planar wave 
propagation over a regional area of arbitrary 
bathymetry. Also, it belongs an elliptical type 
of partial equation. As time goes by, there are 
several types of MSE which is presented one 
after another such like parabolic types of MSE 
2, hyperbolic types of MSE3 and evolution 
equation for MSE4 etc. Generally, the 
mild-slope equation is limited for a bottom 
slope of less than 1/35 because of ignoring 
higher-order terms. Massel6 and Chamberlain 
& Porter7 derived the modified mild-slope 
equation (MMSE) using variational principles 
and keeping the higher-order terms that were 
neglected in Berkhoff’s original derivation. 
Porter & Staziker8 further extended the model 
by introducing eigenfunctions for the 
evanescent modes in addition to the 
propagating mode. They also provided the 
correct jump condition for the modified 
mild-slope equation in the presence of a bottom 
slope discontinuity, which was not properly 
given in Chamberlain & Porter7. As we know, 
most types of MSE are derived from Laplace 
equation which is presented by potential 
function and are usually assumed under the 
condition of step type bottom (Fig.1). However, 
the bottom condition is not well to be described 
by using step type of bottom because of 
discontinuity. Instead of the potential 
formulation that has been used in the previous 
models, a new complementary mild slope 
equation developed by Kim and Bai9 in 2004 is 
derived by Hamilton’s principle in terms of 
stream function theory10. In the formulation, 
the continuity equation is satisfied exactly in 
the fluid domain. Also satisfied exactly are the 
kinematic boundary conditions at the still water 
level and uneven sea bottom (Fig.2). The 
computed results give better agreement with 
those of the exact linear theory than the other 
MSE.

According to Stokes’ law of viscosity, the 
viscosity causes angular deformation of fluid 
because of the shear stress. Also, interior shear 
stress produces negative work to make flow 
motion decay slowly (see Stokes 11). For 
analyzing real flow motion, the Navier-Stokes 
equation (NSE) is usually a useful formulation 
for simulations. Hough12 and Harrison13 
directly used NSE to analyze the wave motion 
of real flow with the slipping and non-slipping 
bottom conditions, but the surface was 
rotational without viscous effects. Stewart14, 
Longuet-Higgins15 and Phillips16 considered 
the shear stress on the free surface. The 
pressure can be obtained indirectly by using the 
conservation of momentum from the boundary 
layer, but the dynamic condition on the free 
surface is still not complete. However, Chen17  
 4 
coefficients would be also verified by 
numerical experiment data. In figure 3 and 5, 
reflection coefficients decay with the increase 
of viscosity respectively. This phenomenon is 
noticeable when incident wave length is long.

over an asymmetric trapezoid trench 
 
Moreover, Fig.5~6 show that the absolute value 
of transmission coefficient |T| decreases more 
significantly as the viscosity increases. This is 
mainly caused by the damping effect of 
molecular viscosity; the damping effect in the 
intermediate wavelength or fluid depth region 
is noticeable. A higher molecular viscosity 
could also lead to |T| which decays larger and 
faster. In addition, in order to validate 
transmission of viscous wave scattering, the 
prescribed FLOW 3D is also utilized. In Fig. 
5~6, the results obtained by the present method 
are similar to those obtained by the FLOW 3D. 
Basically, the present results averagely 
overestimate 3% and 7% as compared to the 
FLOW 3D results for the SAE-30 and glycerin 
cases, respectively. Generally, both tendencies 
of |T| are similar.
