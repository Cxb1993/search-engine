Abstract (Keyword: anodic deposition, rutile TiO2, 
hydrothermal method, supercapacitors) 
    In this work, Ti(III) chloride was used as the 
precursor to prepare titanium oxide via a 
hydrothermal process. The additive, sodium dodecyl 
sulfate (SDS), significantly improves the dispersion 
of TiO2. All RuO2/TiO2/Ti electrodes exhibit the 
rectangular-like i-E responses. The positive sweeps 
show approximate mirror images of their 
corresponding negative sweeps for these annealed 
RuO2/TiO2/Ti electrodes. The charge/discharge 
behavior was symmetric with a isosceles triangle-like 
shape. The current responses, the specific 
capacitances, and the charge/discharge times were 
increased with ascending the RuO2/TiO2 weight ratio. 
These properties demonstrate the good utilization of 
the RuO2/TiO2/Ti electrodes. 
2. Introduction 
    Electrochemical capacitors (also called as 
supercapacitors) are becoming increasingly 
important as the power demands of portable devices 
increase, the world moves towards electric vehicles, 
and there is wider use of renewable energy sources 
[1-4]. For a material to be useful as a 
pseudocapacitor, it should have several oxidation 
states, high electrical conductivity, and 
electrochemical stability [5]. Hydrous ruthenium 
dioxide, RuO2xH2O, is the most promising 
electrode material for electrochemical 
supercapacitors due to its intrinsic reversibility of 
surface redox couples [1,6] and ultrahigh pseudo- 
capacitance [7,8]. Its high cost restricts its bulk 
commercial use until recently to military 
applications [9]. Thus, the use of thin films [10,11] 
of RuO2 and its composites with other materials [12] 
has been investigated.  
3. Methods 
3.1 Preparation of hydrothermal-TiO2 
Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) 
pattern of TiO2 synthesized via the hydrothermal 
process. All the diffraction peaks are in good 
agreement with rutile TiO2 (with lattice constants a = 
b = 4.593Å and c = 2.959Å, PDF NO. 21-1276). This 
result reveals the synthesis of crystalline TiO2 in the 
rutile phase. In spite of adding sodium dodecyl 
sulfate (SDS), no peaks of anatase or brookite phase 
were detected. 
In Fig. 2, the morphology of TiO2 was 
investigated by means of scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM). Despite their various shapes and 
treatments, all samples exhibit the rutile structure 
(confirmed by XRD). From the low magnification 
SEM image, it is clear that large-scale uniform 
spherical particles with an average diameter of ca. 
1.65 µm have been prepared via the hydrothermal 
process without SDS treatment. However, from the 
high magnification SEM image, the spherical 
particles show the aggregates of TiO2 nanorods (see 
Fig. 2(A)). From Fig. 2(B), well-dispersed TiO2 
samples with adding SDS are visible. The nanorod 
morphologies and sizes of the rutile TiO2 are well 
maintained even though SDS was added in the 
precursor solution. 
 
Figure 2 FE-SEM images of rutile TiO2 nanorods 
prepared via a hydrothermal method (A) without 
and (B) with adding SDS in the precursor 
solutions. 
The microstructures of TiO2 were further 
identified by a transmission electron microscope 
(TEM). Figure 3A (without SDS) and 3C (with SDS) 
show the bright-field images of rutile-TiO2 nanorods. 
Inset in (3A) is the low-magnification TEM image, 
indicating that the spherical particles are the 
aggregates of TiO2 nanorods. A d-spacing of 0.24 nm 
in the lattice image (Figure 3B, without SDS) is 
belonged to the (101) plane of rutile-TiO2. The lattice 
d-spacing, ca. 0.32nm, marked in the Fig. 3D (with 
SDS) corresponds to the (110) plane of Rutile-TiO2.

TiO2 nanorods (A,B) without and (C,D) with 
adding SDS in the precursor solutions. Inset in 
(A) is the low-magnification TEM image. 
4.2 Electrochemical performances of 
RuO2/TiO2/Tielectrodes 
The effect of varying the RuO2/TiO2 weight 
ratio is clearly revealed by the cyclic voltammograms 
shown in Fig. 4. The influence of mass of ruthenium 
oxide is negligible because the loading of ruthenium 
oxide on all electrodes is similar (ca. 0.35±0.05 mg 
cm2). Note that the capacitive behavior of all 
RuO2/TiO2/Ti electrodes exhibit the rectangular-like 
i-E responses in the whole potential region of 
investigation. The positive sweeps show approximate 
mirror images of their corresponding negative sweeps 
for these annealed RuO2/TiO2/Ti electrodes. These 
properties are ideal for the application of 
supercapacitors. In addition, with ascending the 
ascending the RuO2/TiO2 weight ratio, clearly 
demonstrating that utilization of ruthenium oxide has 
been greatly improved. This effect is attributed to the 
nanorod structure of TiO2 which form the highly 
porous backbones of the resultant microstructures of 
RuO2/TiO2 composites. 
5. Conclusions 
    In summary, we have developed a simple 
method for dispersing TiO2 nanorods. All x-ray 
diffraction peaks of TiO2 nanorods are well 
corresponding to rutile-TiO2. From SEM and TEM 
images, TiO2 nanorods were well-dispersed by 
adding SDS in the precursor solutions. The nanorod 
morphologies and sizes of rutile TiO2 are not changed 
by adding SDS. Because TiO2 nanorods form the 
highly porous backbones of the resultant 
microstructures of RuO2/TiO2 composites, the current 
responses, specific capacitance, and charge/discharge 
time were increased with ascending the RuO2/TiO2 
weight ratio. These properties are ideal for the 
application of supercapacitors, indicating that these 
RuO2/TiO2 oxides were the potential electrode 
materials for electro- chemical supercapacitors.

era in electrochemical deposition. 
3. Methods 
3.1 Preparation of deposition bath solution 
    TiO2 nanoflowers in the rutile phase were 
synthesized from a 50 mM TiCl3 solution purged with 
air at 25oC for 12 days. This solution was mixed with 
an equal volume RuCl3xH2O and NaAcO solution to 
form the deposition bath containing TiO2 
nanoflowers, 10 mM RuCl3xH2O, and 10 mM 
NaAcO.   
3.2 Fabrication of  RuO2xH2O-TiO2 
nanocomposites electrodes 
The pretreatment procedure of the 10×10×0.5 
mm Ti substrates completely followed our previous 
work [27,28]. These substrates were coated with a 
thick film of PTFE with an exposed surface area of 1 
cm2. RuO2xH2O and TiO2 nanoflowers were 
composite-deposited onto Ti substrates at 1.0 V from 
the bath at 50oC. After deposition, the PTFE film was 
removed and nanocomposites were repeatedly 
degreased with deionized water and finally dried at 
room temperature under a reduced pressure. After 
drying, the nanocomposite electrodes were coated 
with PTFE films with an exposed surface area of 1 
cm2 for electrochemical characterization.  
The morphologies of RuO2xH2O-TiO2 
nanocomposites were observed using a field emission 
scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi 
S4800 type I). The composition of Ru and Ti was 
determined by an energy-dispersive spectroscopy 
(EDS) on the same FE-SEM. The microstructures of 
TiO2 nanoflowers and nanocomposites were 
examined by means of a field-emission transmission 
electron microscope (FE-TEM, Philips Tecnai) 
coupled with elemental mapping by electron energy 
loss spectroscopy (EELS). Electrochemical 
characteristics of nanocomposites were examined by 
an electrochemical analyzer system, CHI 633A (CH 
Instruments, USA) in a three-compartment cell. The 
impedance spectrum analyzer, IM6 (ZAHNER), with 
the Thales software was employed to measure and 
analyze the EIS data. The potential amplitude of ac is 
equal to 10 mV meanwhile its frequency region is 
from 0.1 to 60 kHz. An Ag/AgCl electrode 
(Argenthal, 3 M KCl, 0.207 V vs. SHE at 25oC) was 
used as the reference and a piece of platinum gauze 
was employed as the counter electrode. A Luggin 
capillary was used to minimize errors due to iR drop 
in the electrolytes. All solutions used in this work 
were prepared with 18 M-cm water produced by a 
reagent water system (Milli-Q SP, Japan). 
4. Results and Discussion 
4.1 Material analysis of TiO2 nanoflower

nanoflowers prepared from 50 mM TiCl3 purged with 
air at 25 oC for 12 days. Insets in (B) are its lattice 
image and FFT pattern respectively. 
Fig. 1 shows typical SEM and TEM images of 
TiO2 nanoflowers prepared in this work. Clearly, 
uniform TiO2 nanoflowers were formed from 50 mM 
TiCl3 purged with air at 25oC for 12 days. The 
transparent TiCl3 solution becomes turbid with 
prolonging the purging time, indicating formation of 
TiO2 nanoflowers. The petals of TiO2 nanoflowers 
with an average diameter and length of 10 and 100 
nm, respectively, show the rutile structure from the 
channels and RuO2xH2O particulates connect the 
electronic pathways resulting in the successful 
composite deposition. Annealing in air promoting the 
formation of RuO2 nanocrystallites further reduces 
electronic resistance. Based on the nanocomposite 
with 0.91 mg cm2, the area-based specific 
capacitance reaches ca. 360 mF cm2, meeting the 
requirements of a 5-V supercapacitor for electronic 
applications [16].

scan rate in 0.5 M H2SO4. 
In Fig. 3C, the weak dependence of specific 
capacitance on the CV scan rate for both 
nanocomposites reveals high-power characteristics. 
Commonly, utilization of active materials is 
significantly reduced with increasing material loading 
because of longer pathways of electrolyte penetration, 
electron transport, and proton/cation diffusion in the 
double injecting/expelling process (see the 
performances of RuO2xH2O). From the small 
difference in specific capacitance of curves 2 and 3 in 
Fig. 3C, this phenomenon has been significantly 
improved by employing the 3D porous architecture of 
RuO2xH2O-TiO2 nanocomposites prepared by anodic 
composite deposition.

Spectra 1 and 2 in Figure 4 corresponding to 
RuO2xH2O-TiO2 nanocomposites with total mass of 
0.40 and 0.91 mg cm2, respectively, reveal the ideal 
capacitive behavior. The absence of an impedance arc 
in the high-frequency region on both spectra, nearly 
like a planar electrode, is attributable to the highly 
porous structure of nanocomposites. The above EIS 
responses clearly show the high power characteristics 
of nanocomposites, supporting the minor 
mass-dependent performance. Now, the influences of 
preparation parameters of anodic composite 
deposition (e.g., deposition potential,

and aspect ratio of TiO2 petals) on the

Abstract (keywords: graphene, carbon nanotube, 
RuO2, composite deposition, supercapacitor) 
A ternary ruthenium dioxide/graphene sheet/carbon 
nanotube (RuO2/GS/CNT) composite was 
succcessfully composite-deposited onto Ti for the 
electrode material of supercapacitors. A 
water-well-dispersed GS/CNT composite obtained by 
inserting 10% CNTs as nanospacers to effectively 
impede the restacking of GS worked as an excellent 
substrate for evenly depositing RuO2xH2O 
nanoparticles. In comparing with RuO2xH2O, the 
ternary composite shows a highly porous morphology 
and excellent capacitive performances. Benefits from 
this unique porous structure, the ternary 
RuO2/GS/CNT composite exhibits an ultrahigh total 
specific capacitance (808 F g1), enhanced rate 
capability, high energy and power densities (87.5 Wh 
kg-1 and 157.5 kW kg-1). 
2. Introduction 
Nanocrystalline hydrous ruthenium dioxide 
(RuO2xH2O) has been demonstrated to be the most 
promising electrode material for supercapacitors due 
to its intrinsic reversibility of superficial redox 
couples, good electronic conductivity, and ultrahigh 
pseudocapacitance [1-4]. Due to the involvement of 
proton-electron double injecting/expelling for the 
charge storage process of RuO2xH2O [1,2], 
nanocrystalline RuO2xH2O not only reduces the 
electronic resistance but also promotes the rate of 
proton exchange/diffusion for the high-power 
application [5-8]. Such excellent performances, 
unfortunately, cannot be maintained for relatively 
thick RuO2xH2O films [9,10], especially the 
high-power application. This phenomenon is 
commonly found for most electroactive materials, 
due to longer diffusion lengths of ions/electrons 
[11-14]. Thus, three-dimensional (3D), mesoporous, 
ordered/aperiodic architectures are desirable for 
Electrochemical properties were characterized by an 
electrochemical analyzer system, CHI 633A (CH 
Instruments, USA) in a three-compartment cell. An 
Ag/AgCl electrode (Argenthal, 3 M KCl, 0.207 V vs. 
SHE at 25oC) and a piece of platinum gauze were 
used as the reference and counter electrodes, 
respectively. A Luggin capillary was used to 
minimize errors due to iR drop in the electrolyte. All 
solutions used in this work were prepared with 18 
MΩ cm water produced by a reagent water system 
(Milli-Q SP, Japan). 
4. Results and Discussion 
Typical LSV and i-t responses measured in the 
deposition solution without and with GS/CNT are 
shown in Fig. 1. On both curves in Fig. 1A, sensible 
currents corresponding to the anodic deposition of 
RuO2xH2O commence at approximately the same 
potential (ca. 0.95 V) and the deposition is under 
diffusion control when the electrode potential is 
above 1.2 V. The former result suggests that the 
deposition potential of RuCl3xH2O is not changed by 
introducing GS/CNT into the deposition solution. 
The latter result indicates the obvious influence of 
adding GS/CNT on the limiting current density of 
deposition. This phenomenon is attributed to the 
electrochemical catalytic oxidation of GS/CNT 
through a redox couple generated from RuCl3xH2O 
at 1.0 V [28] because the mass of this composite (0.5 
mg cm2) is close to that of the RuO2xH2O deposit 
(0.45 mg cm2) when the deposition time is the same 
(ca. 4 h). On curve 1 in Fig. 1B, a double-layer 
charging process is initially found and the deposition 
current increases slowly with the deposition time. 
This is attributable to the rough surface of 
RuO2xH2O, enhancing the deposition rate. On curve 
2, after the similar double-layer response, the 
deposition current increases very obviously and 
reaches a pseudo-steady-state value when the 
deposition time is about 4000 seconds, consistent 
with the  result that adding GS/CNT dramatically 
increases the limiting current density of deposition. 
From the above results and discussion, introducing 
GS/CNT in the deposition solution shows significant 
influences on the deposition mechanism. In order to 
obtain an acceptable deposition rate, the 
potentiostatic deposition of RuO2xH2O and 
RuO2/GS/CNT was performed at 1.0 V. 
 
Fig. 1 (A) LSV measured at 10 mV s1 and (B) 
i-t curves measured at 1.0 V from 10 mM 
RuCl3xH2O and 10 mM NaAcO (1) 
without and (2) with 0.9 g L1 GS/CNT. 
 
Figure 2A shows the surface morphology of a 
RuO2xH2O deposit which represents a 
‘‘mud-cracked” morphology, attributable to the 
existence of inner stress in the deposit [26,27]. A 
highly porous surface of the RuO2/GS/CNT 
nanocomposite is clearly found in Fig. 2B, which is 
much rougher than that of RuO2xH2O. Note the 
porous structure consisting of disorder sheets covered 
better properties in capacitance retention and specific 
power against specific energy than RuO2xH2O (Fig. 
4B and 4C). The respectively ultrahigh specific 
energy and specific power of 87.5 Wh kg−1 and 157.5 
kW kg−1 for this RuO2/GS/CNT composite obtained 
at 300 mV s1 show its promising application 
potential for supercapacitors. 
 
Fig. 4 (A) CV, (B) specific capacitance against scan 
rate, and (C) specific energy against specific 
power of (1) RuO2xH2O and (2) RuO2/GS/CNT 
based on a three-electrode test. 
 
5. Conclusions 
Because of the electrochemical catalytic oxidation 
via a redox couple generated from RuCl3xH2O at 1.0 
V, the deposition current density from the GS/CNT + 
RuCl3xH2O solution is much higher than that from 
the medium containing RuCl3xH2O. However, the 
mass loading of the resultant composite is close to 
that of a RuO2xH2O deposit, revealing that 
introduction of GS/CNT in the deposition solution 
shows significant influences on the deposition 
mechanism. Due to the successful composite 
deposition, a highly porous RuO2/GS/CNT composite 
was obtained and its unique microstructure 
maintained the facility of electrolyte penetration and 
builded up the proton pathways to access the active 
sites of RuO2xH2O. The GS/CNT composite acted as 
the conductive backbone and facilitated the electron 
hopping among GS/CNT, RuO2xH2O, and current 
collector. This unique RuO2/GS/CNT nanocomposite 
with a high specific capacitance of 808 F g−1 at 25 
mV s1 exhibited the ultrahigh specific energy and 
specific power of 87.5 Wh kg−1 and 157.5 kW kg−1, 
respectively.

materials are critical to ease the mass transfer of electrolytes within the pores for fast redox 
reactions and double-layer charging/discharging [1-5]. In this regard, mesoporous structures of 
high specific surface area and porosity with an average pore size falling within 2-5 nm are ideal 
for supercapacitor applications. 
Nickel oxides and cobalt oxides are both low cost and environmentally benign transition metal 
oxides, which have been studied for years for supercapacitor applications. Their supercapacitive 
performances however still lag behind those of RuO2. Part of the reasons may be the less possible 
oxidation states available for a range of redox reactions for pseudo- capacitance generation. In 
addition, the electronic conductivity and electrochemical activity of both oxides are not 
satisfactory. Spinel nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4) is also a low cost, environmentally benign 
transition metal oxide, which has been employed in electrocatalytic water splitting (oxygen 
evolution) and lithium ion batteries. 
Nickel cobaltite has been reported to possess a much better electronic conductivity, at least two 
orders of magnitude higher, and higher electrochemical activity than those of nickel oxides and 
cobalt oxides [6]. It is expected to offer richer redox reactions, including contributions from both 
nickel and cobalt ions, than the two corresponding single component oxides, and is a potential cost 
effective alternative for RuO2. 
 
2. Experimental 
Aerogels were prepared with the epoxide addition procedure, followed by supercritical carbon 
dioxide drying. For nickel oxide aerogels, NiCl26H2O was taken as the precursor. In a typical run, 
NiCl26H2O was first dissolved in 2.5 ml of ethanol, followed by addition of propylene oxide at a 
propylene oxide/metal ion molar ratio of 11:1. The solution was stirred for 10 min, and then let 
still to gel at room temperature. The gel was obtained within 1 hr. The wet gel was then washed 
with ethanol several times to remove the by-products from the pore structure of the wet gel. The 
wet gel was then dried with a supercritical dryer (SAMDRI-795, Tousimis, USA). The sample was 
first immersed in liquid carbon dioxide for 5 hrs. Then, the temperature of the dryer was raised to 
45 oC, while the pressure was maintained at 1200 psi for 2 hrs. After that, the system was 
depressurized at a slow rate to ambient pressure to afford the dried aerogel. The dried aerogel was 
further calcined at 200 or 300  oC for 5 hrs to convert the hydroxide to corresponding oxide 
and/or to acquire better crystallinity of the products. 
The XRD patterns of the samples were recorded with an X-ray powder diffractometer (CuKα, 
Ultima IV, Rigaku). The samples were ground into fine powders for the measurements at a scan 
rate of 2o/min. The BET specific surface areas, BJH pore volume, and NLDFT pore size 
distribution were obtained from the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms recorded at 77K (NOVA 
e1000, Quantachrome). The BET specific surface areas were calculated from the adsorption 
isotherms at the relative pressure range from 0.1 to 0.3. The NLDFT pore size distribution was 
analyzed with the adsorption branch data by using the NLDFT algorithm built in the system. The 
found.

The cyclic voltammetry was employed to characterize the capacitive performances of all 
samples in a three-electrode system. Note that the loading of oxide aerogels on every graphite 
substrate was carefully controlled to be ca. 1 mg cm2. The reference and counter electrodes are 
Ag/AgCl and platinum, respectively. Typical CV curves measured at 25 mV s1 between -0.1 and 
0.55 V for the as-prepared aerogels and those with 200oC calcination are shown in Figure 2. Due 
to the formation of NiCo2O4, the anodic and cathodic peaks were shifted to less positive potentials 
with the introduction of Ni2 in comparison with the CV curves of Co3O4. Hence, the potential 
window of interfacial redox transitions becomes wider and the introduction of Ni2 causes a 
significant increase of the electroactive surface area with good capacitive performances. The 
corresponding specific capacitances of all samples were calculated from these CV curves, where 
all aerogels were stabilized by an application of 300 CV cycles in the same potential range, which 
are listed in Table 1. Note that the specific capacitance of all aerogels with 200oC calcinations is 
much higher than that of their corresponding as-prepared samples, probably due to the formation 
of crystalline NiCo2O4 and Ni(OH)2. In addition, Ni-Co-O-0.5-200 shows the highest specific 
capacitance of 1140 F g1 and a symmetric CV curve is obtained under such a relatively high mass 
loading (1 mg cm2) test. In general, high resistance of a high mass loading electrode due to long 
electrolyte penetration/diffusion and long electron-hopping paths results in the low specific 
capacitance. However, aerogels with a mesoporous structure and large pore volume reduced the 
resistance contributed by the electrolyte penetration and ion diffusion, like a reservoir of 
supporting electrolyte to increase the specific capacitance. The redox peaks of Ni-Co-O-0.5-200 
are shifted to more negative values in comparison with the other samples, indicating the atomic

Electrochemical deposition of nanostructured oxides/composites for energy 
storage and conversion systems 
Chi-Chang Hu 
Department of Chemical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University 
E-mail: cchu@che.nthu.edu.tw 
In this keynote lecture, a brief review for the significant influences of nanostructures of 
oxides and composites on the performances of some energy storage and conversion systems will 
be given. Then, both anodic and cathodic deposition methods will be introduced to prepare/design 
the nanostructures of oxides and composites for the application of advanced energy storage and 
conversion systems.  
In the first example, hydrous vanadium oxide (denoted as VOxyH2O) deposited at 0.4 V 
shows promising capacitive behavior in aqueous media containing concentrated Li ions. 
VOx.yH2O annealed in air at 300oC for 1 h shows highly reversible Li-ion 
intercalation/de-intercalation behavior with specific capacitance reaching ca. 737 and 606 F g1 at 
25 and 500 mV s1 in 12 M LiCl between -0.2 and 0.8 V. In 14 M LiCl, retention of specific 
capacitance is about 95 % when the scan rate is increased from 25 to 500 mV s1. This work is the 
first report showing the ultrahigh rate of Li-ion intercalation/de-intercalation in VOxyH2O. A 
so-called Li-ion supercapacitor of the asymmetric type consisting of a VOx.yH2O cathode and a 
WO3.zH2O anode is proposed here.  
In the second example, the microstructure of TiO2 films is designed and controlled by 
adjusting the temperature and cycle number of cathodic deposition from an aqueous solution 
containing TiCl3 and NaNO3. The redox interactions between TiCl3 and NO3 are investigated by 
in-situ ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) absorption spectroscopy. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) is 
employed to study the NO3 reduction and to clarify the deposition behavior of TiO2 in the 
designed plating solution. The decrease in TiO2 deposition rate with the TiO2 thickness may be 
due to the poor electron conductivity of TiO2 depressing the generation rate of OH from the NO3 
reduction. The morphology and size of TiO2 aggregates are strongly influenced by varying the 
deposition temperature from 5 to 50 oC and a maximal rate of TiO2 deposition is obtained between 
25 and 35 oC. TiO2 deposited at 25 oC shows the roughest morphology with a roughness factor (Ra) 
of ca. 67 nm. This study provides a useful method to control the morphology and deposition rate 
of TiO2 films for practical photo-electrochemical applications. 
In the third example, TiCl3 is used as the precursor to prepare titanium oxide nanowires of 
the rutile phase through a hydrothermal process. The additive, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), is 
used to improve the dispersive of TiO2 nanowires. These long TiO2 nanowires were employed to 
construct the porous backbones for depositing RuO2/TiO2 nanocomposites. Hydrous ruthenium 
oxide nanoparticles were directly electrodeposited onto the porous TiO2/Ti substrates, prepared by 
drop-coating of TiO2 nanowires, under a potentiostatic mode. The rectangular-like i-E responses 
and the symmetric charge/discharge behavior with an isosceles triangle-like shape of annealed 
RuO2/TiO2/Ti electrodes reveal the excellent capacitive performances of these annealed
