12. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 Materials
Fresh potato was the testing substrate, which
were cut into cubes of size 2-3 mm and stored at 4°C
for 12-24 h before testing. The potato contained
much carbohydrate and some proteins (Table 1).
Enzyme for enzymatic hydrolysis was prepared
from the returned sludge following secondary
treatment of a municipal wastewater treatment plant
in Shanghai, China. The detailed procedure for
enzyme extraction procedures are available
elsewhere (He et al., 2006). The physiochemical
characteristics of the extracts were also listed in
Table 1.

2.2 Hydrolysis test
Three batches of hydrolysis tests with different
initial concentrations of lactic acid were conducted.
In each test, 20 g of wet potato was wrapped in
gauze bags (80-mesh), and hung in bottles with
50-ml extracting liquors. The extracting liquors used
in batch I tests were with extracts suspension at pH
5-9 (recorded as I-pH5 to I-pH9) or without pH
control (I-pH unadjusted). Batch II and batch III
tests were conducted as in Batch I but with initially
dosed lactate of concentration 15 and 30 g l-1,
respectively. These tests were each with 50 ml
extracting liquors made of 5 ml enzyme extracts
from sludge and 45 ml of 0.1 M phosphate buffer
and added lactate.
In hydrolysis tests the sample bottles were
shaken at 100 rpm and at 37±0.2 °C. The leaching
liquors were refreshed using corresponding fresh
liquors at 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 60, 72, 96 and
144 h of test. With the liquor replacement, the pH
and the acetate level of suspension in test could be
periodically recovered, minimizing the influence of
the surrounding liquor on hydrolysis efficiencies.
2.3 Analytic methods
The collected leaching liquors were filtered
using 0.45μm polyester film, and measured for pH, 
concentrations of dissolved carbon, dissolved
nitrogen, reducing sugar, and amino acid, and
activities of α-amylase and proteinase. The
suspension pH was measured by a pH meter
(OAKION, USA). Dissolved carbon and dissolved
nitrogen concentrations were measured by filtering
sample suspension with 0.45 m filter paper
followed by measured using a TNb/TC multi N/C
3000 Analyzer (Analytik Jena AG, German).
Reducing sugar concentration was
spectrophotometrically determined using
3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method (Miller,
1956). The Lowry method was used for the
determination of contents of amino acid (Lowry et
al., 1951). The activities of α-amylase were assayed
according to Bernfeld method (Bernfeld, 1955).
Proteinase activity was determined using casein as a
substrate according to the method by Lowry method
(McDonald and Chen, 1965).
After 144 h of testing, the residual potato
particulates were tested for total solid (TS) contents,
volatile solid (VS) contents, and the elemental
compositions (C/H/N/S/O). The TS and VS were
determined by drying at 70 oC for 48 h and 550 oC
for 6 h, respectively. The elemental composition was
measured with LECO CHNS-932 determinator
(LECO Ltd., USA).
2.4 Data Analysis
General factorial design and response surfaces
were generated based on hydrolysis data using the
statistical program Design-Expert version 7.0
(Stat-Ease, Minneapolis, USA). The response
surface plot, ANOVA, and standard deviations were
thereby produced.

nitrogen-containing substrate. For batches I-II, the
plateau values were 229±72 mg-N l-1. While for
batch III, this value became 1010±365 mg-N l-1.
Large fluctuation exists in samples presented,
indicating that the intrinsic differences among
samples tested rather than pH controlled the
extraction efficiencies of proteins.
Figure 4 shows the activities of α-amylase and
protease after 144 h of testing. With certain data
fluctuation, the correlation between these enzyme’s
activities and the hydrolysis efficiencies in Figs. 2
and 3 is generally noted. Restated, carbon hydrolysis
was suppressed by the presence of lactate,
particularly under acidic environment. On the other
hand, the nitrogen hydrolysis was enhanced by the
presence of lactate, with a vague correlation with the
suspension pH.

second principal component.Factors;Responses. (b) score contribution of variables.
3.2 PLS analysis
The PLS modeling on carbohydrate hydrolysis
resulted in three principal components (PC1, PC2
and PC3), comprising 21.3%, 12.7% and 7.0% of the
data variation, respectively. The received model has
unresolved variability due to either noise or the
impact of factors that were not considered or had
been set at constant. The loading plot (Fig. 5a)
indicates that the carbohydrate hydrolysis depended
greatly on pH, lactic acid, ORP, and the testing time.
The loading of responses was high in PC1 (21.3% of
data variation), while the loadings of total lactate and
dissociated lactate (LA-) were highest in PC1 among
all factors considered, suggesting that lactic acid was
most the important factor affecting carbohydrate
hydrolysis rate. The score contribution plot (Fig. 5b)
also shows that total lactate and dissociated lactate
had the higher scores than pH and undissociated
lactate (HLA). Hence, the suppression effects of
carbon hydrolysis herein investigated should be
contributed more significantly by the chemical
nature of lactate rather than the declined pH thus
yielded by the dosed acids.
The PLS modeling on protein hydrolysis
yielded three principal components, which
comprised 19.4%, 8.6% and 1.7% of the data
variation, respectively, covering 29.9% of the total
data variation. The loading plot (Fig. 6a) showed
that the effect of pH was minor either in PC1 or PC2,
while the total lactate and dissociated lactate had
higher weight than the H+ and HLA, indicating that
lactate but pH controlled protein hydrolysis.
Furthermore, the lactate and nitrogen related
parameters (TN, AA, and protease) were located at
the same side of PC1. Hence, the efficiency of
protein hydrolysis was positively correlated with
lactate concentrations. The score plot also confirmed
this conclusion (Fig. 6b).
The results of PLS analysis indicated that pH or
lactate affected differently on hydrolysis rates of
carbohydrates or proteins. Both pH and lactate
affected the hydrolysis of carbohydrates, with lactate
being more dominating and inhibitory. In contrast,
the lactate but pH enhanced hydrolysis of protein.
When only hydrolyzed VS was considered as
the response factor, the PLS modeling resulted in
two principal components to comprise 75.5 % and
7.4% of the data variation, respectively, totally
covering 82.9% of the data variation. Total lactate
and dissociated lactate were more significant than
pH and undissociated lactate on VS reduction.
915 and 30 g l-1. Thereby, alkali environment would
be more preferable for enzymatic hydrolysis when it
needed to reduce the inhibitory effect of lactic acid.

3.4 Comparison of lactate and acetate’s effect on
hydrolysis
For batch IV with 20 g l-1 acetate, VS reduction
was higher at neutral and alkaline condition than at
acid condition, i.e 42%-47% at pH 7-9 and
26%-34% at pH 5-6.
In all, the trend of pH effects on hydrolysis was
similar with or without organic acids, i.e. less
suppressing at neutral and alkaline condition (pH 7-9)
than at acid condition (pH 5-6). Nevertheless, the
presence of 15 g l-1 of lactate yielded 13%~32%
reduction of hydrolysis compared to each
corresponding pH, while 30 g l-1 of lactate and 20 g
l-1 of acetate yielded 25%-45% and 8%-18%
hydrolysis reduction, respectively. Obviously, the
addition of organic acids (lactate or acetate) reduced
the hydrolysis efficiency. The effect of organic acid
could not be attributed to pH effect, but also to
organic acid itself. Furthermore, the hydrolysis was
more reduced by lactate than acetate, compared
either from the basis of mass concentration (g l-1) or
mole concentration (mol l-1). The pKa of HLa/La-
and HAC/Ac- were around 3.86 and 4.74 at 25oC.
Hence, most of lactic acid or acetic acid in the
liquors was in the dissociate form, i.e. more than
93% except for the case of extrinsic acetic acid at pH
5, where dissociate form only counted for 64%.
Hence, the molecular organic acid was less
inhibitory than its basic counterpart to potato
hydrolysis.
For the scenarios without refreshing leaching
liquors, least VS reductions were abstained. The pH
values for these four tests were kept constant due to
weak acid’s buffer, i.e. 4.28, 2.84, 2.2 and 2.87 for I,
II, III, IV-pH unadjusted. In these liquors, more than
90% of organic acids were in the form of
undissociated form, confirming molecular acid’s
negative effect.

but the suppression by 15 or 30 g l-1 lactate was
obvious and strengthener than the inhibitory effect of
acetate. The evolution of cumulative dissolved
nitrogen showed that the effect of pH on protein
hydrolysis was minor, while the lactate could
stimulate the hydrolysis of protein. The PLS
modeling demonstrated that the hydrolysis of
carbohydrate was both affected by pH and lactate,
with lactate the more important factor. Therefore, the
influence by lactate on carbohydrate hydrolysis was
mainly due to the presence of lactate species, but the
corresponding decline of pH.
