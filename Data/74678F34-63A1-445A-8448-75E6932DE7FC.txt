  
to the particle, effectively suppressing the agglomeration 
usually occurring in other gas phase processes and leading 
to the formation of nps with size small enough to possess 
quantum confinement effect.3 The as-synthesized nps did 
not show PL, likely due to the presence of a large amount 
of dangling bonds on the surface. Oxidation in HNO3 was 
found to sufficiently passivate such defects and allow the 
nps to show strong red PL (Fig. 3). The size of nps can be 
further modified with a wet-etching process, where HNO3 
was used to oxidize the surface of the nps to form silicon 
oxide and HF was used to etch the oxide away, thus 
reducing the size of nps. Fig. 4 shows red to green PL from 
nps wet-etched for different durations, which corresponded 
to different sizes of nps. This confirmed the size-tunability 
of the PL of the nps.  
The PL of as-etched nps was unstable. Even in 
environment of only 30ppm oxygen, the PL completely 
degraded after 12 h of UV-illumination (Fig.5). 
Functionalization of nps with phenylaceytlene was applied 
to passivate the surface. We observed (Si-C=C) peak 
around 1600 in infrared spectrum (IR)4 (Fig.6) and Si-C=C 
peak at δ125 ppm in 13C nuclear magnetic resonance 
spectrum (NMR)5 (Fig.7), indicating successfully grafting 
of the organic moiety on nps surface. The PL of 
functionalized nps was stabilized, showing little change 
after 18 days storage (Fig.8). The photostability is still 
under investigation. 
On the other hand, passivation of the nps with a 0.5 
nm Al2O3 shell greatly improved the photostability of the 
nps. The passivated nps underwent UV-illumination for 12 
h in glovebox and 2 h in air without significant degradation 
(Fig.9). The nps also showed good dispersibility and PL 
stability in polar solvent (Fig.10). 
The I-V characteristic of Si thin films deposited from 
Si nps solution is shown in Fig. 11, where the conductivity 
was estimated to be comparable to that of vapor-deposited 
amorphous Si film. 
 
4. Conclusion 
We successfully synthesized Si nps with size < 5nm 
by the plasma decomposition of silane. The size of the nps 
could be modified with a wet-etching process, which 
allowed the PL to be adjusted from red to green. The air- 
and photo-stability of the PL of the Si nps were greatly 
improved by passivation with either a solution-processed 
phenylaceytlene surface-terminating group or a 0.5 nm 
Al2O3 shell deposited by a vacuum process. With both 
methods, the passivated nps underwent UV-illumination for 
12 h in glovebox and 2 h in air without significant 
degradation. Finally, the I-V characteristics of solution-cast 
Si film from nps were demonstrated to be comparable to 
those of vapor-deposited amorphous Si film. The excellent 
stability and solution processibility of the Si nps offer great 
potential for applications in optoelectronics and 
bio-imaging device.

Report:  
The purpose of this trip is to present a paper entitled “Mechanism of passivation-induced 
degradations of polymer thin-film transistors: effects of solvents and passivating polymers.” The 
abstract of this paper is as follow. This study investigates the effects of the solvent and the 
chemical structure of encapsulating polymers on the encapsulation-induced degradations of 
poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs). 9 solvents and 10 vinyl 
polymers with different side groups were tested on bottom-gate, bottom-contact P3HT OTFTs, 
and the following conclusions were obtained: (1) the solvents caused only temporary degradation 
to the OTFTs, which was fully reversible upon removal of the solvents; (2) the encapsulating 
polymers resulted in various degrees of irreversible doping effect on the OTFTs; (3) the 
encapsulating polymers with highly polar side groups, including -OH, halogens and nitrile, 
increased the off current by 2-4 orders of magnitude and rendered the OTFTs dysfunctional; (4) 
the encapsulating polymers with less polar side groups, including alkyl, phenyl, carbonyl, ether 
and ester, caused negligible doping effect. By taking into account these sources of degradation as 
well as the H2O/O2 permeability of encapsulating polymers, we designed and demonstrated an 
effective 2-layer encapsulating film, which caused no encapsulation-induced degradation and 
achieved > 2000 h of lifetime in the encapsulated OTFTs.
