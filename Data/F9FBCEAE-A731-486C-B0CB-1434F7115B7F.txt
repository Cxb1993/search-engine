Abstract  
One of the most important problems in this post-genomic era: to understand the 
biological basis of complex traits and diseases from genome–wide association studies; especially 
use single-nucleotide polymorphisms to intensively study gene-gene and gene-environment 
interactions. This study is a research project which is a comprehensive study of detecting gene-
gene and gene-environment interaction for complex traits.    
The massive genomic data, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), can be acquired 
more effectively and efficiently because of the advances of genotyping technology in the past 
few years -- the number of SNPs can be genotyped from hundred of SNPs to thousands of 
thousand SNPs.  As a result, the approaches originally proposed in phase I & II of this study are 
not applicable owing to the massive data/noise.  Based on a series of experiments on Phase II 
study, we propose two new search approaches, sliding windows and random sampling, for 
detecting Gene-Gene and Gene-Environment Interactions in Genome-wide Association.  This 
approach takes advantage of the classification power of support vector machine and the 
heuristics computing. 
The proposed approaches were (separately) applied to the three data sets: CAPS (population-
based case-control study in Sweden), CGEMS (Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility, from 
National Cancer Institute), and JAG2 (Prostate Cancer patient population at Johns Hopkins 
Hospital).  Not all analysis show positive but some did show this is promising approach for 
tackle this genome-wide association (GWA) study.

Method, Material and Results  
 
Based on the computing experiments we did in the Phase II, the estimate the noise 
tolerance of SVM, two concepts of searching for detecting Gene-Gene and Gene-Environment 
Interactions are proposed: Sliding Windows and Random Sampling search. These two search 
concepts can only identify the existence of SNPs interactions within some “big” range of SNPs 
by considering the effect of nuisance. While some “big” ranges of SNPs are identified, 
Recursive Feature Elimination approach we adopted in Phase I to do the fine searching within 
the ranges. 
We present the Sliding Windows search algorithm first, then Random Sampling. To 
illustrate the algorithms, several notations are denoted as follows: n represents the total number 
of SNPs in the dataset under investigation; m is the number of SNPs involved in an interaction; N 
is an index set that contains all SNPs (N = {1, 2,…, n}); a SNPs window W with length w is a 
subset of N with w consecutive indices; Sm is a subset of W containing m SNPs (Sm={s1, s2,…, 
sm}); and F(•) is the average prediction accuracy of k-fold cross-validation SVM.

After the candidate “Window” being identified, Recursive Feature Elimination can be used to

Note that the Sliding Windows approach is based on one intuitive assumption: those 
SNPs form interaction should within some certain distance range.  However, there is still no any 
research to support this assumption.  In order to go around this assumption, instead using 
 Figure 1. Recursive feature elimination for CGEMS 
 
 
 
In addition to CGEMS, JAG2 (Prostate Cancer patient population at Johns Hopkins Hospital) 
data was used to replicate the result in CGEMS. JAG2 contained 1909 prostate cancer cases and 
3085 control subjects. Since these two data seta are not genotyping in the same platform, only 
617 SNPs (common) have been selected for further analysis. The best gene-gene interaction 
model for CGEMS (based on SVM) was 94.5% (training accuracy; and 91.7% in 5 fold cross 
validation), but the same model applied in JAG2 was only 50.5%.  While the best gene-gene 
interaction model for JAG2 (based on SVM and weight adjustment for unbalanced data proposed 
in Phase I) was only 61.9% (training accuracy; and 61.8% in 5 fold cross validation), but the 
same model in CGEMS was only 48.4%.   If we removed 1676 controls from JAG2 to make a 
balanced data, the best gene-gene interaction model for JAG2 (based on SVM) was 69.9% 
(training accuracy; and 55.0% in 5 fold cross validation), and the same model in CGEMS was 
only 55.4%.    The proposed approach seems working well, but results are not what we expected.  
The only explanation is that there is some negligible inconsistency between the two genotyping 
platforms.  The total running time took about 2 weeks.  
 
Conclusion  
 
Owing the resources (labor/programming and computing) obtained from this research 
project, we can only perform few analyses on the acquired data sets.  Not all analysis show 
positive, maybe due to the different platforms of genotyping,   but some did show this is 
promising approach for tackle the genome-wide association study.  Up to the day of wrap this 
report, there are three other data sets under investigation which will be further analysis by the 
proposed approaches. We are hoping these developing approaches can be further validated.
