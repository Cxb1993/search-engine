chemical reduction [8,11,17,21-22] 
which tend to cause inhomogeneity and 
microsegregation.  
In this study, the Sn-Cu alloy was 
prepared by refining in a vacuum at a 
higher cooling rate.  So the target for 
sputtering was a homo-Sn-Cu 
intermetallic compound.  Avoiding the 
above mentioned problems, the Sn-Cu 
system has acceptable cost, simple 
process conditions (low m.p., larger solid 
solution limit, lower activity of elements 
and higher safety, the annealing 
temperature of Sn-Cu is about 250℃, 
while that of Sn-Ni is from 350℃ to 
600℃[14, 23]), environmental protection 
( does not contain P, S, Co) and 
excellent capacity, making it one of the 
best choices for an anode material.  So, 
the present work not only investigates 
the microstrucural characteristics of 
Sn-Cu film anodes, but also discusses 
feasible applications. 
 
2. Experimental procedures 
A Sn-Cu target was prepared in a 
vacuum melting furnace.  A film of 
Sn-Cu was sputtered on 10 μm Cu foil 
without any treatment.  The film with a 
thickness of 500nm is defined as 
SC500 ； the 1500nm is defined as 
SC1500.  Some SC1500 films were 
annealed at 200℃ for 1hr in a vacuum 
(the cooling rate was approximately 0.1
℃/sec) and are designated SC1500-H.  
Each sputtering film was cut, after which 
charge-discharge testing was performed.  
The composition of  the electrolyte was 
LiPF6 + EC + DEC (EC：DEC=1：1 vol.). 
The micro-morphology and interface 
characteristics of the Sn-Cu film were 
investigated by SEM and Focused Ion 
Beam (FIB).  The phases and IOC of 
the un-heated films and heated films 
were analyzed by thin-film XRD.  The 
two main diffraction peaks (30.35o and 
43.45o) were selected to analyze the 
index of crystalline (IOC).  The IOC is 
defined as the function, X=(IC/ISTD)*100%, 
the IC is the sum of integrated values of 
the two peaks for measured samples, 
the ISTD is that of standard sample and X 
is the IOC.  The angle of incidence was 
1o.  The velocity of scanning was 4o/min 
and the range was from 20o to 100o.  A 
constant current was used for 
electrochemical testing with 50 cycles of 
charge-discharge.  The voltage was 
0.2V (equation: Li2CuSn + 2.4Li → 
Li4.4Sn + Cu).  In Fig. 4, the curves also 
possess two level zones.  For the 0.4V 
zone, the longer SC1500 curve suggests 
that more Li2CuSn was produced during 
the discharge reaction.  Due to the 
effect of film thickness, the initial electric 
potential of the SC1500 film was higher 
than that of the SC500 film.  Fig. 5 
shows the charge and discharge 
capacities as a function of cycle 
numbers for the SC500 film and SC1500 
film at room temperature.  The first 
charge capacity of the SC1500 film 
(560mAh/g) was higher than that of the 
SC500 film (351mAh/g).  After 50 
cycles, the SC1500 film still possessed a 
better charge-discharge cycling capacity. 
According to previous research and 
relevant references [26-27], a sputtering 
film with higher IOC not only causes 
resistivity to decrease, but also inhibits 
lattice deformation during cycling.  In 
addition, the lithium ions had fewer 
obstacles during migration which 
improved the cycleability of the 
charge-discharge.  In order to avoid the 
effects of film thickness, grain size and 
deposited cracks, the SC1500 film was 
subjected to the recrystallization at 
200℃ for 1hr in a vacuum, then cooled 
to room temperature with a cooling rate 
of 0.5℃/min.  In this way, a 
recrystallization film (named SC1500-H) 
with a higher IOC was obtained.  
 
3-2 Recrystallized behavior and 
compound phases 
Fig. 6 is the surface image of the 
SC1500-H film and there is no obvious 
difference compared with the SC1500 
film (Fig. 1(b)).  Comparing the XRD 
patterns of the SC1500-H film and 
SC1500 film (Fig. 7), the two peaks (32° 
and 45°) disappeared after the heat 
treatment.  Based on a reference 
[24-25], the main reason why peaks 
disappear is that some low-temperature 
Cu6Sn5 phases (η’-Cu6Sn5) transform 
into high-temperature Cu6Sn5 phases 
(η-Cu6Sn5).  η-Cu6Sn5 can enhance the 
cycleability of charge-discharge.  In 
addition, the IOC of each film was 
calculated from the thin-film XRD pattern.  
The SC1500-H film was defined to be a 
standard (IOC: 100%) because it had the 
highest IOC of all the films (Fig. 8, 
shows the SC500 film).  The results 
film, a thicker film (SC5000nm) is 
prepared to investigate the film structure 
and the capacity.  Fig. 12 shows the 
surface characteristics of SC5000, 
revealing the dendritic crystals.  The 
cross section observation was showed in 
Fig. 13 (a).  Notably, many deposited 
defects were found on the film and a few 
Cu3Sn phases (Fig. 13 (b), dark zones) 
formed in the Cu6Sn5 film matrix (bright 
zones).  In other words, the 
microstructure of SC5000 thin film was 
composed of Cu6Sn5 phases, Cu3Sn 
phases and solidification defects 
distributed in the film matrix.  To 
compare the capacities, the charge and 
discharge capacities as a function of 
cycle numbers for the SC500 film, 
SC1500 film and SC5000 film at 25℃ 
were shown in Fig. 14, the SC1500 film 
had a better cycleability than the other 
films.  In addition, the cyclic 
voltammetry (CV) of SC5000 film was 
performed to understand the lithium ions 
migration (Fig. 15).  Two peaks were 
found in 0.65V (LiSn phases) and 0.2V 
(Li4.4Sn phases).  Notably, ~0.4V 
position had no peak that was different 
from the results of Fig. 4 and Fig. 9.  It 
should be concluded, from what has 
been said above, that the dendritic 
structure (microsegregation and defects) 
of SC5000 film restrained the oxidation 
reduction.  A schematic illustration of 
the Sn-Cu thin film for charge and 
discharge capacity is shown in Fig. 16.  
It is noteworthy that increasing thickness 
of film or annealed treatment (200℃-1hr) 
was not enhanced completely for the 
charge-discharge characteristics of 
Sn-Cu thin film materials.  
 
4. Conclusion 
The IOC and grain size of Cu6Sn5 
film increased with increasing the 
thickness of the film.  After 
recrystallization at 200℃-1hr, the Sn-Cu 
film had a higher IOC and lower 
resistivity.  Due to the growth of 
deposited cracks and the area of passive 
film increasing, the η-Cu6Sn5 (high 
temperature phase) was not able to 
enhance the charge-discharge 
cycleability.  A thicker Sn-Cu film 
possessed Cu6Sn5 phases, Cu3Sn 
phases and deposited defects that 
affected the oxidation reduction.
