Introduction (前言/研究目的/文獻探討) 
Over the past two decades, studies on organic-inorganic nanocomposites have gained 
increasing attention from academic and industrial communities. These nanocomposites are 
predominantly composed of polymer matrices loaded with a small amount (≤ 3 wt.%) of 
nanoscaled fillers (nano-fillers) [1]. The properties of nanocomposites depend on the type of 
reinforcing nano-fillers used. Among the nanocomposites investigated, nanoclay-incorporated 
polymer systems have been extensively investigated and are reported to have synergistically 
advanced properties [2,3]. For polymer nanocomposites with improved electrical properties, 
conductive carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be used as ideal nano-fillers. CNTs possess excellent 
properties, which include high electrical conductivity, low density, tremendous mechanical strength, 
and excellent flexibility [4]. Several studies on polymer/single-walled carbon nanotube composites 
and polymer/multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWNT) composites have been conducted to develop 
advanced/functional materials [5–9]. These new materials can be used in the automobile, aerospace, 
and electrical industries. Three main techniques, namely, solution mixing, melt compounding, and 
in-situ polymerization, are used to fabricate CNT-containing nanocomposites. However, two major 
challenges exist in fabricating nanocomposites with viable performance, namely, the fine dispersion 
of CNTs throughout the polymer matrices and the strong interfacial adhesion between CNTs and 
polymers.  
Syndiotactic polystyrene (sPS) is a promising engineering thermoplastic used in many 
applications [10]. Extensive studies have been conducted to characterize its thermal and mechanical 
properties, processability, and polymorphism. Four major crystalline polymorphs (namely, 
α, β, γ, and δ) have been identified. The formation of these polymorphs mainly depends on thermal 
treatments [11–13]. Of the four polymorphs, α- and β-forms are the more predominant ones under 
normal crystallization conditions. The thermodynamically stable β-form has an orthorhombic 
structure, whereas the less stable α-form has a hexagonal structure. The crystallization kinetics and 
the melting behavior of sPS have also been investigated [14–16]. Woo et al. [15] shed light on the 
relationships among crystallization kinetics, polymorphic crystals, and the multiple melting peaks 
in sPS. A higher pre-melting temperature and a slower crystallization process induce the formation 
of stable β-form crystals. 
The development of sPS nanocomposites could further enhance the desirable properties of sPS 
[17–21]. Montmorillonite (MMT) nanoclay is frequently used as an appropriate filler to fabricate 
high-performance sPS nanocomposites. Wang et al. [17] fabricated sPS/MMT nanocomposites with 
a more enhanced thermal stability compared with neat sPS. Previous studies [18,19] reported on the 
crystallization kinetics as well as the polymorphic behavior of sPS/MMT nanocomposites. The 
presence of MMTs favors the formation of α-form sPS crystals and enhances the rigidity of the sPS

2.3. Characterizations 
The surface feature of MWNTs was characterized using a transmission electron microscope 
(TEM) (Jeol JEM-2000EX II) at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. Ultrathin cryo-microtomed 
sections of the composites (<80 nm) were prepared for TEM observations to reveal the MWNT 
dispersibility within the sPS matrix. The phase morphology of the composites was also examined 
under a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Hitachi S-500). The cyro-fractured 
surfaces of the composites were observed, and the samples were immersed in liquid nitrogen before 
fracturing. Polarized light microscopy (PLM) was performed to observe the crystalline morphology 
of the sPS in its neat state and in the composites. An Olympus BX-50 PLM with an attached 
charge-coupled device camera was used with a Linkam THMS 600 hot stage. The thin-film 
specimens were prepared by melting the samples first and then compressing them between the glass 
slides. The crystal forms of sPS in the samples were characterized via X-ray diffraction (XRD) 
under room temperature using a Siemens D5005 X-ray unit with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å).  
The crystallization and the melting behavior of the samples were measured using a Perkin Elmer 
DSC 7 analyzer. The samples were first melted at 320 °C for 5 min, followed by cooling to 20 °C at 
two different rates of 10 and 40 °C/min for non-isothermal crystallization experiments, or 
fast-cooling to pre-determined temperatures (Tc) for isothermal crystallization experiments. The 
crystallized samples were subsequently heated to 320 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min to evaluate the 
melting behavior of the samples. The thermal stability of the samples was characterized using a 
thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) on a TA Q50 system under an N2 environment and an air 
environment at a heating rate of 20 °C /min. The rheological properties of the melted samples were 
measured using an Anton Paar Physica rheometer (MCR 101) in dynamic mode with parallel plate 
geometry (20 mm diameter and 1 mm gap). The samples were held between the preheated plates at 
285 °C for 5 min before the measurements were obtained. The strain amplitude was set at 0.1%, 
and the sweep frequency varied from 0.1 rad/s to 100 rad/s. The electrical resistivity of the samples 
was measured using commercially available resistivity meters (Mitsubishi Chemical Co., Models 
MCP-HT450 and MCP-T600) on 2 mm thick compression-molded strips. 
 
Results and Discussion (結果與討論)  
3.1. Phase morphology 
Figure 1a shows the TEM image of the MWNTs used in the present study. The entangled 
MWNTs had smooth surfaces and curved features. Figures 1b to 1d show the SEM images of the 
cryo-fractured surface of the representative composites. In the images, the tiny white dots and short 
lines correspond to the MWNTs. The MWNTs were thoroughly and randomly dispersed in the sPS 
matrix regardless of the loadings. A higher amount of dispersed MWNTs is observed with 
increasing MWNT loading. The insets in Figure 1 illustrate the phase morphology of the samples at 
a higher magnification. The varied amounts (i.e., 0.3, 0.5, and 3 phr) of the MWNTs were mostly 
separated into individual tubes in the sPS matrix during the melt mixing process. Long pulled-out 
MWNTs were barely detected in the samples. The fractured MWNTs were mostly embedded within 
 5 
was selected to prepare the specimens for XRD investigations and to verify further the change of 
the sPS polymorph in the presence of the MWNTs. A lower pre-melting temperature of 290 °C and 
a relatively low temperature of 245 °C were employed to crystallize isothermally the neat sPS and 
its nanocomposites. Figure 4b shows the XRD spectra of the isothermally crystallized samples. The 
two characteristic diffractions existed for the neat sPS, and the intensity ratio of the diffraction at 
2θ =12.2° to that at 2θ =11.6° increased when the MWNTs were added. The diffraction at 2θ 
=11.6° becomes much smaller when the MWNT content was ≥0.5 phr. The calculated Pα  values 
for these isothermally crystallized samples are listed in Table 1. The MWNTs facilitated the 
formation of sPS β-form crystals. Thus, the MWNTs affected the polymorphism of sPS crystals, 
which was different from that of organoclays (20A). For the neat sPS and the nanocomposites 
cooled from 320 °C at slow rates of 10 and 40 °C/min, the β-form sPS crystals remained 
predominant (data not shown). The effect of incorporating the MWNT on the apparent crystallite 
size (L) of the 245 °C isothermally crystallized samples was estimated based on the full width at 
half maxima of the characteristic diffraction peak at 2θ =12.2° [(040) of β-form crystals] using the 
Scherrer equation [26]. The values are given in Table 1. The nanocomposites had smaller crystallite 
size than that of neat sPS, which can be attributed to the extensive nucleation effect due to the 
dispersed MWNTs. 
3.3. Crystallization and melting behavior 
Figure 5a shows the DSC cooling thermograms of the samples at 10 °C/min. The 
crystallization onset (To) and crystallization peak (Tp; at the exotherm minimum) temperatures of 
neat sPS were 245.3 and 239.3 °C, respectively. To and Tp shifted to higher temperatures after the 
addition of MWNTs. A higher loading of MWNT caused a slight increase in To and Tp. These 
observations correspond to the PLM results, which confirmed that the MWNTs served as 
nucleation agents during the sPS crystallization. Nevertheless, the crystallization exotherm of the 
nanocomposites broadened. The nanocomposites with an MWNT loading of ≥ 1 phr seemingly 
underwent a two-stage crystallization (high temperature I stage and low temperature II stage) 
process. These broadened exotherms indicated that the crystal growth was slower for sPS because 
of the formation of nanoconfined/constrained environments caused by the finely dispersed MWNTs 
[27,28]. In addition, the decline of sPS chain mobility in the composites should also be taken into 
consideration because of a higher melt viscosity. The thermograms further illustrated the decrease 
in crystallization enthalpy (∆Hc) of the sPS in the presence of MWNTs. The crystallinity of the sPS 
declined in the composites. The samples cooled at a rate of 40 °C/min exhibited similar 
formulation-dependent behavior, as shown in Figure 5b. The thermal data of the samples cooled at 
40 °C/min are listed in Table 1.  
The overall isothermal crystallization kinetics of the samples was also investigated. Figure 6 
shows the DSC thermograms of the neat sPS and of the three nanocomposites upon crystallization 
at distinct temperatures (Tc). Crystallization took a longer time to complete when the Tc of the 
individual samples was increased. In the present study, crystallization induction time (t0.01) and 
crystallization half time (t0.5) were defined as the time when the maximum crystallization exotherm 
 7 
(mainly in β-form) during the heating scans [15,16]. After the MWNTs were added, Peak I shifted 
to a higher temperature, and the position of Peak II almost remained constant. The intensity ratio of 
Peak I/Peak II increased when the MWNT content was increased. The two peaks merged when the 
MWNT loading was higher than 0.5 phr. This behavior demonstrated that MWNTs facilitated the 
formation of more stable sPS crystals in the nanocomposites, which led to the gradual 
disappearance of the peaks associated with the melting–recrystallization–remelting process. The 
MWNT-induced higher crystallization temperature for sPS (Figure 5) is responsible for the 
observations. In the neat sPS cooled at 40 °C/min (cf. Figure 8b), aside from the two peaks (small 
Peak I and large Peak II), one exothermic shallow was observed between the two peaks. This 
melting behavior slightly differed from that of the sPS cooled at 10 °C/min. A faster pre-cooling 
rate of 40 °C/min induced less stable original crystals, and then a profound recrystallization process 
occurred during the heating scans. That is the melting process of the original crystals (Peak I) was 
less evident, and a following partial exothermic shallow is displayed because of the overlapping 
effect. The remelting peak (Peak II) was more predominant because of the higher extent of the 
recrystallization process. The nanocomposites cooled at 40 °C/min had a similar melting behavior 
as that in Figure 8a. The temperature of Peak I increased when the MWNT content was increased. 
The two peaks again merged when the MWNT loading was increased. The intensity ratio of Peak 
II/Peak I was higher for each sample that was cooled at 40 °C/min compared with that at 10 °C/min. 
A faster pre-cooling rate was confirmed to result in a higher extent of 
melting–recrystallization–remelting process of the sPS crystals.  
The melting behavior of isothermally crystallized samples was also investigated. Figures 8c 
and 8d show the melting curves of the isothermally crystallized neat sPS and sPS-0.5. Some 
common features were observed for both samples. First, two melting peaks of Peak I and Peak II 
were evident at low Tcs. Second, Peak I shifted to a higher temperature when Tc was increased, 
whereas Peak II shifted to a slightly lower temperature. Third, the intensity ratio of Peak I/Peak II 
increased when Tc was increased. The two peaks then merged at high Tcs (i.e., ≥ 255 °C). The main 
difference between the two samples is that sPS-0.5 had a higher Peak II/Peak I intensity ratio 
compared with that of neat sPS (values included in the figures) under the same Tc. This result 
suggested that the presence of MWNTs favored the formation of more stable β-form crystals (Peak 
II-associated) when the samples were crystallized at the same Tc. The representative Tm values of 
Tc=255 oC samples are listed in Table 1. These values were used to examine the effect of MWNT 
addition on the Tm of stable sPS crystals. The value increased from 269.3 °C for neat sPS to 272.1 
°C for the sPS-0.1 composite. A higher MWNT loading generally led to a slight increase in this 
value. The increase in Tm for the composites was mainly attributed to the decrease in the entropy 
change of the crystals melting process caused by the nanoconfined effect of the dispersed MWNTs 
[28].         
3.4 Thermal stability 
Figure 9a shows the TGA-scanned results of the samples in air. The addition of MWNTs 
caused an increase in the thermal stability of the sPS. The temperature at 5 wt.% loss (T5%) 
 9 
the composites with MWNT loadings of > 0.5 phr, the phase angle gradually decreased with the 
decreasing |G*| value, which indicated an increase in the elastic characteristics. Thus, the 
rheological percolation threshold was estimated to be between an MWNT loading of 0.5 and 1 phr 
at 285 °C.        
The electrical resistivity of the samples was expected to decrease drastically once the MWNT 
conductive network was achieved. Figure 11 shows electrical resistivity as a function of the 
MWNT loading for the samples. The neat sPS had a resistivity of approximately 9×1012 Ω-cm. 
Increasing the amount of MWNT from 0.1 phr to 3 phr reduced the electrical resistivity by more 
than 10 orders of magnitude to approximately 2×102 Ω-cm. An evident drop was also observed for 
a percolation threshold between an MWNT loading of approximately 0.5 and 2 phr. This threshold 
was slightly lower than the values (ca. > 2 wt.%) reported for other sPS-related composite systems 
[21,22]. Different factors affecting the electrical properties of CNT-containing polymers were taken 
into account, including the impurity and surface treatments of CNTs, the dispersion status of CNTs, 
and the fabrication methods of the composites. The current electrical data confirmed that the 
MWNTs were thoroughly dispersed within the sPS matrix using an efficient mixing method. The 
electrical resistivity of the sPS-3 composite was lower than that reported by Kumar et al. [21] for a 
sPS/carbon nanofiber system at a similar carbon nano-filler loading. Moreover, this resistivity was 
comparable with that of Sun et al. [22] for a solution-mixed sPS/MWNT system. 
 
Conclusions (結論) 
sPS-based nanocomposites were fabricated via a conventional melt mixing technique. Pristine 
MWNTs were used as nano-fillers in the sPS matrix. Morphological observations revealed that the 
MWNTs were thoroughly dispersed in the sPS matrix, which confirmed that interactions between 
the MWNTs and sPS were sufficient. A small amount of MWNTs could facilitate the nucleation of 
sPS, and then led to the formation of much smaller sPS crystallites. The nucleation temperature 
increased up to 12.2 °C for the composite with an MWNT loading of 3 phr. The crystal growth 
geometry of the sPS differed in the composites because of the extensive nucleation effect and the 
formation of a nanoconfined/constrained environment due to the MWNTs. The MWNTs facilitated 
the formation of the β-polymorph of sPS, and decreased the extent of the 
melting–recrystallization–remelting process of the sPS crystals during the heating scans. The 
thermal stability of the sPS increased by approximately 31 °C at an MWNT loading of 3 phr. The 
rheological percolation threshold was between an MWNT loading of 0.5 and 1 phr because of the 
thorough dispersion and the interconnectivity of MWNTs within the sPS matrix. The electrical 
resistivity of the sPS decreased by more than 10 orders of magnitude with an MWNT loading of 3 
phr. The electrical percolation threshold was between an MWNT loading of 0.5 and 2 phr.

品化的產品出現。此外，聆聽了" Composite Materials" 與" Membranes for Water Treatment" 
兩個 Sessions的部份報告，亦令本人有所收穫，學習可採用新的技術鑑定分析本人實驗
室製備的高分子奈米複合材料與生物高分子複合材料。 
三、建議 
綜觀此次會議發表之論文與籌備單位之努力，本人期待國內研究機構與學校能加緊腳
步，政府投入更多資源，並促進產學合作，相信必可急起直追美、日、韓及大陸等於
工程領域已有一定研發成果之國家。此外，本人初次至首爾市，對該市進步之情形印
象深刻，地鐵(Railroad)與觀光產業相當發達，人民亦很友善，政府等觀光旅遊局亦全
力支持研究機構舉辦國際研討會，提升韓國之國際名聲，此些地方是我國可以學習的，
我們只要學術界多團結，政府多支援，相信我國不會輸給韓國的。
