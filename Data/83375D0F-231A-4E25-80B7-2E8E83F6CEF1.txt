Advanced safety vehicle (ASV) is the important objective of the rapidly growing 
international researches on intelligent transportation systems (ITS). There are many 
famous systems perform the automated function, like the Rapidly Adapting Lateral 
Position Handler (RALPH) system on Navlab-5 vehicle which was a vision-based one. 
The generic obstacle and lane detection system developed by the University of Parma 
in Italy is a stereo vision based one in their experimental vehicle named ARGO. The 
vision part performs both lane and obstacle detection in front of the vehicle, and the 
controller currently adopted for ARGO was initially designed and optimized for the 
road-following (or called lane-keeping) task. The Ohio State University (OSU) 
demonstrated the results of steer-by-wire on their experimental car, Honda Accord LX, 
and the lane-keeping and lane-changing maneuvers were also presented in. The PATH 
program has demonstrated an infrastructure based approach. It adopts a 
reference/sensing system, which consists of discrete magnetic markers mounted in the 
special roadway, forming a predetermined path, and magnetometer equipped on the 
front of the experimental vehicle. 
Vehicle automations are currently being introduced into the assistance to relieve 
human drivers from undesired routines of driving task. Since many studies have 
shown that over 90 percent of highway accidents are occurred due to driver-related 
errors, the main initiative is to improve safety of the automation system interacted 
with the human driver. As to the vehicle longitudinal automation control, some 
famous practical works introduce the features like adaptive cruise control (ACC).   
The safety consideration into the vehicle longitudinal automation is the safety 
headway distance adjustment to avoid the collision with the vehicle ahead.  
Coupling phenomena becomes more and more significant while driving at a higher 
acceleration but keeping in a safety vehicle-spacing. Sliding-mode-control and 
dynamic-surface-control methods were used to deal with nonlinearity and 
complicated coupling-effect. Many research methods were based on Lyapunov-based 
nonlinear control technologies. Recently, some researchers developed coordinated 
longitudinal- and lateral-control technologies to deal with nonlinearity and 
coupling-effect such that a vehicle system can drive safely in  various  driving 
environment. 
 Based on the cruise-control design in “教育部ITS計畫”, we shall develop: (1) the

2.2.1 Supervisory Controller 
There are two stages in the supervisory control shown in the below figure. In the 
first stage, a desired acceleration is determined according to the available feedback 
signals. In the second stage, the desired acceleration is converted to a desired velocity 
which is then issue to the sequential regulation control.  
 
Figure 6. Two-stages supervisory control for car-following system. 
Sliding-mode-control (SMC) technology is adopted to design the control laws. In 
SMC, a proper surface S as the function of system states is defined and the design is 
to make sure that the sliding manifold, S=0, for the closed-loop system is 
asymptotically stable. Therefore, S is defined such that  
0, 0.SS S< ≠                         
This criteria will drive the state trajectory to the stable manifold in a finite-time 
interval and stay at the equilibrium surface. Therefore, we can choose the control law 
as  where K>0. We now define the relative distance R=X,S KS= − p-X and the 
desired headway distance desR V Lσ= + , where X and Xp are the following- and the

2.3 Fuzzy-estimator-based Observer-embedded ICC controller 
 
 A road in Taiwan is just like a snake-body. It is important to add manlike 
preview-ability to make an automatic car smart enough to perceive and to adjust the 
driving-behavior to such a bad road-condition. Besides, the lateral velocity of a 
vehicle is hard to measure directly from the available sensors due to high-frequency 
sensor noise. We here, based on the developed lane-keeping technology in “教育部
ITS卓越計畫”, propose a preview-ability observer-embedded intelligent cruise 
control (ICC) technology. Furthermore, a fuzzy estimator is developed as a passive 
fault-tolerant controller (FTL) with regarding to the bike-modeled-based lane-keeping 
vehicle system to detect sensor-failure and to maintain the stability of the ICC 
lane-keeping system. Once the faults are detected, warning is generated and the 
embedded observer will be automatically replaced by the fuzzy estimator, shown in 
Fig. 11.

We, here, further limit the lateral acceleration to be less than 0.3-0.4g ( g is 9.8 m/s2) 
 to ensure passengers being in a smooth and comfortable situation. Since the lateral 
velocity is difficult to measure especially in high-speed driving. We, based on the 
above preview lateral dynamics, develop the corresponding observer,
