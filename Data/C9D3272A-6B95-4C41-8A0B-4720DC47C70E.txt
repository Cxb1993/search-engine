II. RECTENNA DESIGN 
A. CP Wide-Slot Antenna 
The schematic of the proposed CP rectenna is show in Fig. 1. The experimental prototype of the rectenna is fabricated on 
single copper-clad FR-4 substrate with a thickness of 0.8 mm and a relative dielectric constant ε r = 4.4, which consists of a 
CP wide-slot antenna with CPW-fed, a LPF, a rectifying circuit with the voltage doubler rectifier, a RF block/DC pass 
parallel chip capacitor and a load resistance. Both the antenna feed and the rectifying circuit input port have characteristic 
impedance of 50Ω for good impedance matching to reduce signal reflection between these components.  
The steps taken to design the rectenna begin at the CPW-fed wide-slot antenna for receiving RF power is designed to 
operate at 925 MHz and it has the advantages of the Right-Hand CP (RHCP) character. The chip components involving 
rectifying device can be easily mounted across the gap of CPW-fed without using the via-holes as seen in Fig. 1. 
For a wide-slot antenna to achieve the CP radiation and operation at 925 MHz, the parameters of the simple strip line and 
L-shaped tuning stub that loaded at the ground with wide-slot is about 80.42 mm which is equal about the 0.247 λ0 of 925 
MHz from the feed were used for creates unequal lengths for two separate current paths to excite two orthogonal modes with 
quadrature out of phase as CP operation, and what is more, these current paths correspond to two hybrid operating modes 
which operate very close in frequency result in good CP performance. 
By introducing the meander line structure into the CP wide-slot antenna, which also increase the current path of radiator 
which can reduce the size of the antenna at the same frequency equally. For this reason, the proposed CP wide-slot antenna 
shows a 60% size reduction over the conventional ones. At the same time, the circumference of the wide-slot is about 324.95 
mm which is equal about the 1.001 λ0 of 925 MHz. Furthermore, based on the package size of the chip components, the gap 
separation of the CPW is chosen to be 1.1 mm.  
B. Low Pass Filter 
In this study, the simple LPF between the wide-slot antenna and the rectifying circuit has designed, which composed of 2 
pF chip capacitor-CM and 18 nH chip inductor-LM connected in a series-parallel manner as well as shown in the Fig. 1.  
It allows the RF energy at operating frequency of 925 MHz to passes and to rejects unwanted higher order harmonics 
generated by the nonlinear device and prevents the higher order harmonics from re-radiating through the antenna. Thus, the 
harmonics generated by the nonlinear rectifying diode are rejected back to itself and remixed to generate more DC power 
and the RF-to-DC efficiency is improved. On the other hand, it should be noted that the LPF is used not only for harmonics 
and interference suppressing, but also for impedance matching to make the antenna feed and rectifying circuit input port of 
50Ω at 925 MHz. 
C. RF-to-DC Rectifying Circuit 
The rectifying circuit for rectenna design is composed of a diode as the rectifying device, a DC pass/RF block chip 
capacitor and a load resistance. The output DC voltage of two diodes are added in series, which not only increases the overall 
value of voltage sensitivity for the network (compared to a single diode detector), but also provides a higher output DC 
voltage and a greater RF-to-DC conversion efficiency. A commercial schottky detector diode pair (HSMS-282C by Agilent 
Technologies) is selected here for RF-to-DC power conversion, and there are two diodes connected in a series-parallel 
manner as voltage doubler rectifier into a single package. The equivalent circuit of a single diode consists of a series 
resistance RS = 6 Ω and a zero-bias junction capacitance CJ0 = 0.7 pF. Moreover, its maximum forward voltage VF and 
minimum breakdown voltage VBR is 0.34 V and 15 V, respectively.
