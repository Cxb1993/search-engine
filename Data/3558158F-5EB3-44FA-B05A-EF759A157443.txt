enamel reported elsewhere. This is due to the 
compression of specimen is under open loop control. 
Under the test condition, the compliance of tensile 
test machine strongly affected the real compression 
between cross head. In order to acquire the real 
compression of enamel specimen, the displacement of 
cross head should be monitor by extensometer. This 
study showed that the mechanical behavior of enamel 
is time-dependent under compression. The summation of 
Prony constants fitted from the normalized stress-time 
curve of ramp-hold experiment with displacement rate 
of 0.001 mm/s is 0.12. This value implies the 
instantaneous modulus of enamel is about 12% higher 
than the long-term modulus of enamel. The findings of 
the stress relaxation trend in this study still 
provide significant baseline information for 
development of more realistic constitutive models 
which can be used in the study of biomechanics in 
dentistry for enamel.

Abstract 
The mounting structure of photovoltaic (PV) panel 
must be designed to withstand wind-induced loads; 
however, there are no standards about wind load 
requirements for PV panel mounting structure in Taiwan. 
Since Taiwan lay in the path of typhoons, the PV panel 
mounting structure should be able to withstand the massive 
loads resulting from severe typhoons. In this study, the 
safety of a new designed stand-alone ground-mounted PV 
array mounting structure subjected to high wind loads was 
investigated by fluid-structural interaction analyses. The 
inclination angle of PV panel considered is 30 degree in 
this study. The design wind speed is 60 m/sec and the wind 
loads were evaluated under three different incident 
directions (00, 900 and 1800). CFD analyses were used to 
calculate the aerodynamic forces acted on PV panel and 
mounting structure and then these forces were applied to 
the finite element model of PV panel and mounting 
structure for structure analyses. The critical regions of 
components of mounting structure were identified and the 
weak regions which could not meet the requirement were 
redesigned to improve the reliability. The analyses results 
showed that the Von-Mises stress in critical region was the 
smallest under the wind with incident direction of 900, and 
the wind with incident direction of 1800 applied the highest 
wind load on the structure thus the Von-Mises stress in 
critical region is the highest. However, according to 
current design, the maximum Von-Mises stress in all 
components of mounting structure is below the yield stress 
of the materials of these components under all loading 
cases. 
 
Introduction  
Responding to the “Kyoto Protocol”, Taiwan promotes 
the development of renewable energy vigorously. With 
sufficient sunshine, the installation of photovoltaic (PV) 
systems in southwest seaboard regions of Taiwan has 
being promoted recently. PV mounting structures installed 
in Taiwan must be designed to withstand wind-induced 
loads since Taiwan lay in the path of typhoons. In this 
study, the safety of a new designed stand-alone ground-
mounted PV array mounting structure subjected to high 
wind loads was investigated by fluid-structural interaction 
analyses. The critical regions of components of mounting 
structure were identified and the weak regions which could 
not meet the requirement were redesigned to improve the 
reliability.  
 
Methods 
The mounting methods of solar panels vary 
significantly, and the wind loads exerted on different 
mounting structures vary significantly. Even for the same 
mounting structure, the wind loads could be different, 
under the same wind condition, due to different mounting 
locations such as ground or roof. Different methods had 
been used to investigate the wind loads on solar panel 
modules or mounting structures [1-5]. In this study, PV 
array mounting structure subjected to high wind loads was 
investigated by fluid-structural interaction analyses. The 
surrounding air was considered as incompressible fluid and 
the PV panel and mounting structure were considered as 
solid structure. In order to perform an accurate stress 
analysis of each components of the mounting structure, a 
detail structure model was made. The inclination angle of 
PV panel was 30 degree. The design wind speed was 60 
m/sec and the wind loads were evaluated under three 
different incident directions (00, 900 and 1800). CFD 
analyses were used to calculate the aerodynamic forces 
acted on PV panel and mounting structure and then these 
forces were applied to the finite element model of PV 
panel and mounting structure for structure analyses. The 
finite element and CFD models are shown in Fig. 1. The 
computational domain for CFD analyses was made in such 
a way that the domain was large enough to reduce effects 
due to blockage. Non-slip wall condition was applied to 
the ground and solar panel surfaces.

In order to obtain the material properties of the critical 
parts (extruded aluminum alloy) of mounting structure, 
compression and 3 point bending tests were performed on 
the specimen cut from the part of mounting structure.  The 
specimens under tests and the test configurations are 
shown in Fig. 2. The material was considered as elastic-
plastic material with strain hardening. The optimization-
based inverse iterative finite element analysis procedure 
[6-8] was used to obtain the material constants such as

structure due to 60m/sec wind load with (a) 00, (b) 900 and (c) 
1800 incident directions. 
 
 
The most important goal of this study was to evaluate 
the stress level of the new design C-shape extruding parts 
at both sides of the mounting structure shown in Fig. 6 and 
of the the related locking mechanism. The analyses results 
showed that the high stress region of the C-shape parts, 
under the wind with incident direction of 00, is located at 
the lower edge of these parts and the maximum Von-Mises 
stress is about 2 MPa. The high stress region of the C-
shape parts, under the wind with incident direction of 1800, 
is located at the upper edge of these parts and the 
maximum Von-Mises stress is also about 2 MPa. The Von-
Mises stress in the C-shape parts is relatively small and 
uniform under the wind load with incident direction of 900. 
According to the current design, the maximum Von-Mises 
stress in the critical parts of mounting structure is below 
the yield stress under all loading cases.

Conclusion  
The PV mounting structures installed in Taiwan have 
to withstand severe wind-induced loads due to typhoons. In 
this study, the safety of a new designed stand-alone 
ground-mounted PV array mounting structure subjected to 
60 m/sec wind loads was investigated by fluid-structural 
interaction analyses. The high stress regions of critical 
components of mounting structure were identified and 
maximum stresses were obtained.  The analyses results 
showed the maximum Von-Mises stress in the critical parts 
of mounting structure was below the yield stress under all 
loading cases.
