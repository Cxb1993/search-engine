一般雷射加工通常是應用雷射以聚焦的
方式來加工，雷射聚焦是指將雷射光束聚集
成一很小之焦點，以得到高密度能量，將材
料以熔化甚至氣化的方式完成切割。此法會
在局部產生高溫，易造成材料表面燒融的現

射離焦加載的方式進行玻璃裂片實驗。 
雷射離焦加載的優點在於將工件置於雷
射聚焦點之下，雷射光點的直徑也隨之變

Abstract 
The aim of this paper is to present and discuss data on underwater laser drilling techniques for 
brittle substrates. In this study, substrates were submerged to a depth of 1 mm. Drilling under 
water reduced substrate defects that typically result from conventional laser drilling in air. A CO2 
laser was used to drill holes into LCD glass and alumina substrates. It was found that the 
underwater laser drilling quality for these materials is much better than that from laser drilling in 
air. Underwater laser drilling reduced the phenomena of micro-cracking and minimized the size of 
the area affected by heat from the laser. Also in this study, single-hole drilling and array-holes 
drilling by percussion and trepanning were conducted and analyzed both in air and underwater.  
The minimum distance between the two neighbour holes that can be obtained was much shorter in 
water than in air. The SEM photographs of the holes illustrate the contrast in drilling quality. The 
relationship between laser power, pulse repetition rate, and the hole quality was also evaluated.

1 Introduction 
The technique of underwater laser drilling has great 
potential in many applications. Recently, Kruusing [1,2] 
further reviewed the advantages and disadvantages of 
the water-assisted laser processing and concluded that 
the technique can be successfully applied to etching, 
cutting, surface cleaning, and laser shock processing.  
Furthermore, Mueller et al. [3] studied the 
interaction between the CW CO2 laser and water.  When 
a CO2 laser is applied to a substrate submerged in water, 
the laser is absorbed efficiently by the water, and the 
laser can vaporize the water rapidly. This vaporization 
creates a conical keyhole shape, as well as many 
bubbles in the water. 
Lu et al. [4] investigated the mechanism of 
underwater drilling by Nd:YAG laser for metal plates 
underwater. They found the phenomenon of liquid-jet-
induced impulses by cavitation bubble collapse in the 
vicinity of a solid boundary. The conductivity of water 
is better than that of air. The laser heat dissipates into 
water so that the hole surface is cooled for a better 
surface quality. Most molten material dissolves in water, 
eliminating the re-solidification around the hole surface 
that occurs in air. During the laser drilling, the Nd:YAG 
laser produces plasma in the drilling hole.  The pressure 
on the plasma in water is greater than that in air, thus 
the size of the plasma in water is smaller and requires 
more laser power for drilling [4,5]. 
An [6] studied the laser drilling for sodalime 
glass by water-assisted ablation with femtosecond laser 
pulses.  With this technique, the water carries away the 
debris generated in the drilling process, thus reducing 
the pileup around the hole. 
In conventional laser drilling in air [7,8], the 
heat-affected zone and micro-cracks occur in the holes 
cut by the laser. The cracks decrease the material 
strength. According to Pompe et al. [9] and Morita [10], 
the heated region near the surface of an originally 
stress-free material gets loaded in compression. If the 
temperature was sufficiently high, the stress relaxes by 
creep. Consequently, as the material heats up and then 
cools, a tensile stress builds up and the surface will 
begin to crack. Ogura [11] studied the phenomenon of 
pileup around the hole for drilling in air. The molten 
materials produced by the laser heat accumulate at the 
edges of the hole. 
In contrast, underwater laser processing can 
reduce the generation of such defects and pileup around 
the laser-cut hole. The cooling effect of water can 
reduce the size of the heat-affected zone. Both the 
efficiency and quality of laser drilling can be greatly 
increased if it is done in water as oppose to air. 
Many studies discuss the mechanism of 
underwater laser processing, but few studies focus on 
laser drilling parameters and the complexities of drilling 
multiple holes or trepanning drilling.

3 Experiments of underwater laser drilling 
for LCD glass 
3.1 Percussion drilling of single hole 
The single-hole drilling was performed. The laser power 
used ranged from 40 W to 70 W and the pulse repetition 
rate was 1 Hz, 10 Hz, 100 Hz, and 100 Hz. The 
substrate was typically submerged to 1 mm beneath the 
water surface. The SEM (scanning electron microscope) 
photo of the laser drilling LCD glass in air is shown in 
Fig. 5(a). Micro-cracks and molten materials 
accumulated around the hole. 
 A typical view of the hole surface of the LCD 
glass drilled by laser percussion in water is shown in Fig. 
5(b). The laser light when projected onto the water, 
induced fluid motion that carried away debris from the 
working zone. The physical properties of water cool the 
molten surface and reduce the heat-affected zone, 
leaving the surface quality free of micro-cracks. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The diameter of the hole, both at the laser input 
surface and output surface, drilled in water is smaller 
than that of drilling in air.  The relationship between the 
diameter of hole, pulse repetition rate, and laser output 
power is shown in Fig. 6.  In water, the hole diameter of 
the input surface is 0.5 mm for a laser power of 20 W at 
1 Hz.  The hole diameter increases to 0.9 mm with the 
use of a laser power of 70 W at 1 Hz.

through hole.

Thus data indicates that the higher the laser 
power, the larger the hole diameter when drilling under 
water. However, for drilling in air, hole diameters at 
laser input surface and output surface stop increasing 
after the laser power of 50 W and 70 W, respectively.  
This is because the molten materials re-solidify around 
 1 Hz. Therefore, it was concluded that the higher the 
laser power, the larger the hole diameter.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The relationship between the laser power, pulse 
repetition rate, and taper angle is shown in Fig. 14. For 
drilling in water, the taper angle is uniform for different 
laser power, but for drilling in air, the higher laser 
power, the higher the taper angle. 
 
4.2 Percussion drilling of array-holes 
Because micro-cracks are generated frequently when 
drilling in air, the holes must be spaced an adequate 
distance apart. The hole-distance is restricted to a 
threshold value.  In contrast, drilling underwater has no 
such restrictions because micro-cracks do not occur.  
Figure 15 shows array-holes drilled for this study. The 
laser power used was 70 W at 1 Hz, and the drilling 
time was 1 second per hole. For the laser drilling of 
alumina substrates, the minimum distance between the 
holes that can be obtained without breaking is 30 mm in 
air and 5 mm in water.

4.3 Trepanning drilling 
Underwater laser drilling can prevent the generation of 
the micro-cracks for alumina substrates, so the 
trepanning drilling can be successfully performed in 
machining a large hole.  
(a)
Fig. 16(a) shows alumina substrate drilled by 
trepanning in air. The diameters of the trepanning holes

If the micro-cracks are generated in the holes during 
processing, the cracks will link together and the 
substrate will break. Therefore, the array-holes drilling 
and trepanning drilling are much more difficult than the 
drilling of a single hole. In this paper, the laser drilling 
technique with the water cooling-assistance for brittle 
substrates was studied.  The underwater drilling was 
applied to the single-hole drilling and array-holes 
drilling. The laser used was a CO2 laser and the 
experimental materials were LCD Glass and alumina 
substrates. The SEM photographs of the holes were 
obtained to analyze the drilling quality. The relationship 
between laser power, pulse repetition rate, and the hole 
quality are also discussed.

2 Principle of underwater laser drilling 
2.1 Underwater drilling system and substrates 
Figure 1 is the configuration of the underwater laser 
drilling system. For this study, the substrate was 
submerged 1mm beneath the water surface.  This depth 
was based on the dynamic physical properties of the 
water and laser.  The deeper a substrate is submerged, 
the more laser energy is lost to water absorption.   
However, if the underwater distance is too shallow, the 
necessary rate of cooling is lost, and the desired quality 
of drilling is not achieved. Therefore, the optima 
underwater distance was determined to be 1 mm.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The laser used in this study was a pulsed CO2 
laser. The wavelength of the CO2 laser was 10.6 µm and 
the minimum diameter of the focused spot was 130 µm.  
The specimens were glass substrate and alumina 
substrates. The glass was fused silica glass, TFT-LCD 
Eagle2000, produced by the Corning Company (Taiwan).  
The glass thickness was 0.63 mm. The alumina (Al2O3) 
substrate is produced by the Leatec Fine Ceramics 
Company (Taiwan). The purity of the alumina substrate 
was 96% with a  thickness of 0.635 mm. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.2 Interaction of laser and water 
Figure 2 illustrates the interaction between the CO2 laser 
and water. When the laser is applied to the water surface, 
it can induce rapid heating and vaporization due to the 
strong absorption properties of water. Many bubbles are 
generated during the laser vaporization process. If the 
pressure of vaporization steam is greater than that of 
water, the water is repelled out and a conical keyhole is 
formed.  
Figure 3 is an image of the CO2 laser in the water.  
As shown in the image, when a laser with a power of 
70W and pulse rate of 1 Hz, 10 Hz, 100 Hz, and 100 Hz 
is projected into the water, a keyhole and bubbles are 
formed. The bubbles influence the shape of the keyhole.  
The pulse repetition rate of 10 Hz produced the most 
bubbles and the rate of 1 Hz produced the least.  The 
shape of the keyhole is typically a conical space for 1 
Hz. The bubbles distributed more in the upper water 
surface for the laser repetition rate of 100 Hz and more 
in the inner of the keyhole for 1000 Hz.. 
 
2.3 Effect of water cooling 
The cooling water can reduce the temperature and 
temperature gradient around the hole to prevent thermal 
damage from occurring in the hole surface. The water 
can cool the molten surface and reduce the heat-affected 
zone, improving the surface quality and eliminating 
micro-cracks. 
Most of the molten material dissolves in the 
water; there is no re-solidification pileup around the 
hole as in air. The particle is carried away due to liquid 
motion by thermal convection or bubbles moving.  
Therefore, the debris re-deposition around the hole is

the hole, causing shrinkage, a phenomenon that does not 
occur in underwater drilling. 
The geometrical quality of laser drilling can be 
represented by taper angle α, demonstrated in Fig. 7.  
The α=2tan-1((D-d)/2t), where D is the diameter at the 
top of the hole, d is the diameter at the bottom of the 
hole, and t is the substrate thickness. The relationship 
between the laser power, laser power repetition rate, and 
taper angle is shown in Fig. 8. For drilling in water, the 
hole taper angle is much smaller than drilling in air. For 
drilling in air, the higher the laser power, the higher the 
taper angle. In contrast, when drilling in water the 
higher the laser power, the smaller the taper angle.

3.2 Percussion drilling of array-holes 
The configuration of array-holes drilled for this study is 
shown in Fig. 9. For the array-holes drilled in air, holes 
may break and link together if the arrangement of the 
holes is too compact. The configuration of cracks 
linkage of two drilling holes is shown in Fig. 9. The 
crack typically extends toward the crack of the other 
one, linking the holes together.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Figure 10 shows array-holes drilled in air and in water.  
The laser power used was 70 W at 1 Hz, and the drilling 
time was 1 second per hole. Micro-cracks were 
generated in the edges of the holes drilled in air. The 
cracks link with each other causing the substrate to 
break and become unstable. For those holes drilled in 
water, no cracks resulted, thus preventing substrate 
failure. In air, the minimum hole-distance that can be 
obtained before breakage is 5 mm in air, in water it is 
2mm. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.3 Trepanning drilling 
The Laser drilling by trepanning is usually used to 
machine a hole with a large diameter. The laser beam is 
swung in a circle defined by the desired profile of the 
hole. If there are micro-cracks generated in the 
trepanning path, the substrate will break during the 
drilling process. The cracks generated within the 
trepanning path link together. 
Underwater laser drilling can prevent micro-
crack, so that trepanning drilling can be successfully 
performed in machining a large hole. Fig.11(a) and (b) 
show LCD glass drilled in air and water, respectively. 
The diameters of the drilled holes are 10 mm, 20 mm, 
30 mm, and 40 mm. The laser power used was 70 W at 
100 Hz. The laser scanning speed was 3 mm/s. The 
trepanning drilling technique failed to apply to the 
drilling of the LCD glass in air because the edge of the 
coaxial holes cracked and linked together. 
 
4 Experiments of underwater laser drilling 
for alumina substrates 
4.1 Percussion drilling of single hole 
The SEM photos of laser drilling for alumina substrate 
are shown in Fig. 12(a) and (b). It was concluded that 
laser drilling in water can prevent the generation of 
micro-cracks. In addition, the surface quality is much 
better than that from the drilling in air. 
The diameter of the hole drilled in water at the 
laser input surface and output surface is smaller than 
when drilled in air. The relationship between the 
diameter of hole, pulse repetition rate, and laser power 
is shown in Fig. 13. For drilling in water, the hole 
diameter of the input surface was 0.8 mm for a laser 
power of 50 W at 1 Hz.  The hole diameter increased to 
1.3 mm when the laser power was increased to 70 W at
