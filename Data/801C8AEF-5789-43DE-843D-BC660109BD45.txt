Abstract 
This plan considers that transmissions 
of volatility are time-vary and 
asymmetric. Generally, there are many 
and complex reasons that can affect 
transmissions of volatility such as good 
news and bad news, etc. In this situation, 
the model estimation is more difficult to 
solve and becomes a highly nonlinear with 
many local minima problem. For these 
reasons, we adopt the method of 
artificial intelligence to propose an 
ITGARCH (Intelligent Threshold 
Generalized Autoregression Conditional 
Heteroscedasticity) model. In this plan, 
we would modify the threshold value by 
using the rule of intelligent. 
The ITGARCH model, which combines the 
advantages of the GA (Genetic Algorithm) 
and Fuzzy theory to switch the threshold 
value of TGARCH model. The results 
indicate the transmission of volatility 
for stock markets are time-vary 
nonlinear and asymmetric. The 
transmissions of volatility in propose 
model is exactly performance

1. Introduction 
The data analysis for time sequence, it 
is often the case that the conditional 
variances unmatched the assumption of 
homogeneity according to traditional 
econometrics models, especially in 
financial data [1]. The financial data 
would be easily subjected to the positive 
or negative information; the markets are 
existed the asymmetric. Bollerslev [2] 
proposed the generalized autoregressive 
conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) 
model. The model would not recognize the

value, and (1) (1) (1) (2) (2) (2)0 0, , , , ,i j i jα α β α α β are 
unknown parameters and necessary to be 
estimated. Without loss of generality, 
we assume

Generally, the threshold value in TGARCH 
model is constant. It would not be 
described well nor conform to actual 
phenomena. Consequently, this plan 
considers that the threshold value would 
be as a time-varying nonlinear function 
to adopt the method of artificial 
intelligence to propose a time-varying 
nonlinear threshold ITGARCH model.

In order to estimate the parameters, tI  
would be satisfied with these 
assumptions as follows: 
1. The sequence tI  is assumed to 
asymptotically stationary of 
independent tε . Furthermore, they are 
mutually independent ( ( ) 0t tE Iε = ). 
2. p is the probability of tI  
( [ ]( 1 )r tP I p= = ), which is constant and 
independent of time ( ( )tE I p= ). 
In equation (4), tr  is the threshold 
value, which is a time-varying nonlinear 
function. Generally, the threshold value 
is usually complex and indescribable. 
Therefore, we use the method of combines 
the GA and Fuzzy rule to obtain it. 
ITGARCH model is based on the fuzzy rules 
and GA to adjust the threshold value for 
positive or negative information. We 
used the triangle membership function. 
According to the triangle membership 
function, we separate into three parts 
such as fall, same, and raised. We used 
membership functions to deal with the 
time-varying nonlinear system. The 
triangle membership function is in 
Figure 1.

Where a, b, and c are constant which are 
based on the probability distribution of 
market index and empiricism. They stand 
for fall, same, and raised, 
respectively. 
In this plan, we present the 
transmissions of volatility for the 
market index and the last local market 
index. The volatility effects are based 
on the Fuzzy rules. 
1. If the last market index would fall 
then the probability of fall will 
increase in the market index.

The daily closing stock-price index of 
Taiwan weighted index is in Figure 2. 
That is a probability distribution of 
Taiwan weighted index in figure 3. It is 
shown that Taiwan weighted index is not 
only fat trial but also excess kurtosis. 
The figure 4 is represent that the 
threshold value is a function of time and 
nonlinear; not the constant. The sum of 
square innovations in GARCH model is 
64603, TGARCH model is 3282, and ITGARCH 
model is 2912. The empirical result 
indicates that the stock markets of 
Taiwan weighted index is asymmetric and 
time-vary nonlinear. Due to the 
innovations and explanations of the 
ITGARCH model are much better than 
others.  
 
 
5. CONCLUSION 
 
Zakoian proposed the TGARCH model to 
solve that the information existed 
asymmetric in financial markets. In 
general, there are many and complex 
reasons that can affect the 
transmissions of volatility. They keep 
the characteristics of nonlinear and 
time-vary. For these reasons, this plan 
considers that the method of artificial 
intelligence to propose an ITGARCH model. 
We investigate the transmissions of 
volatility of the stock market. 
 By using ITGARCH model, the 
empirical results indicate the 
transmissions of volatility for market 
index are time-vary nonlinear and 
asymmetric. We also detect the ITGARCH 
model, which owns the effect of 
description much better than TGARCH 
model. 
 However, there are a lot of theories 
and models to research the financial 
markets. This plan is only using 
intelligence (combines the GA and Fuzzy 
theory) and time-vary nonlinear to 
investigate. In future, we could 
consider other methods and dynamic to 
research. We wish develop a suitable.
