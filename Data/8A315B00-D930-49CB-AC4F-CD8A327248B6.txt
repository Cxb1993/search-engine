torque equations both in infinite medium and in the 
vicinity of wall for generalized dielectrophoresis 
based on the linearized theory of effective moment in 
the literature. (2) For the dc case, we have carried 
out detailed numerical calculation from 

NPN (Nernst-Poisson-Navier) model for understanding 
the detailed nonlinear effect on the problem, where 
 is the ratio of the electric double layer 
thickness () to the particle radius. Consider the 
polystyrene particle for example. The Clausius-
Mossotti factor (K) tends to  0.5 as  tends to 
zero. When the surface charge density of the particle 
() is low (the electric double layer effect is 
limited), K also tends to  0.5 as  tends to 
infinity based on that the ionic concentration of the 
surrounding medium decreases (thus  increases). 
When  is high, the distributions of the co-ion and 
counter-ion in the electric double layer can be 
altered due to an applied electric field, even if it 
is substantially less than the zeta potential built 
up by the surface charges. In such a situation, the

(I) Introduction 
Generalized dielectrophoresis, including conventional dielectrophoresis generated by 
non-uniform electric field without phase shift (exerted force to particles), electrorotation exerted 
torque to particles), and travelling wave dielectrophoresis (exerted both force and torque to 
particles), are effective tools in the manipulation and characterization of particles and cells in 
micro-fluidic systems, even down to the level of nano-sized objects such as DNA, proteins and 
viruses (see Hughes, 2003). Sketches with a clear illustration of these three disciplines of 
generalized dielectrophoresis can be found from a recent review article by Lei and Lo (2011).  
Basic theory of generalized dielectrophoresis can be found from Pohl (1978) and Jones (1995, 
2003). Recently, a comprehensive review on the status of the theory, technology, and applications 
of dielectrophoresis was given by Pethig (2010). There are also excellent review articles on 
specific topics, including the electrorotation by Arnold and Zimmerman (1988), the application of 
dielectrophoresis in biotechnology by Pethig and Markx (1997), the particle separation using 
dielectrophoresis by Gascoyne and Vykoukal (2002), the electrical forces for microscale cell 
manipulation by Voldman (2006), and the applications of dielectrophoresis for stem cell research 
by Pethig et al. (2010). Electrothermal forces arise as a result of high field intensity in 
microfluidic systems; they may affect the dielectrophoretic manipulation, particularly for cases 
with sub-micron particles at low frequency. Details of the electrothermal forces as well as other 
forces were discussed in Ramos et al. (1998) and Castellanos et al. (2003). 
The generalized dielectrophoresis can be applied effectively using micro electrodes or array(s) 
of electrodes, operated with dc or ac signals, and with or without phase shift at different 
electrodes. Appropriate force and torque expressions are required for both understanding the 
behind physics and designing the devices for manipulation. Most of the theory in the literature are 
5 
 
across the diffuse layer is governed by the Possion-Boltzmann equation (if the movement of 
the electroyte is negligible), which is the Gauss law with the Boltzmann equation describing 
the variation of ion concentration with electric potential. Boltzmann equation is a result of the 
ion concentration at equilibrium as a result of the balance between the electrical and 
diffusional forces. The general nonlinear theory described by the Possion-Boltzmann equation 
in the diffuse layer is known as the Gouy – Chapman theory, and the linearized approximation 
is called the Debye – Huckel theory. The variation of the potential across the diffuse layer is 
exponential according to the linearized theory. The boundary between the Stern and diffuse 
layer is approximately the surface of shear, which is an imaginary surface within which the 
fluid is stationary. The potential at the surface of shear is called the zeta potential with a 
reference zero potential set at the bulk medium outside the diffuse layer. The zeta potential is 
of order of 50 mV for latex particles according to the literature. If we take the thickness of the 
diffuse layer as 10 nm, then the electric field across the electric double layer is of order of 
65 10 V/m.×  Details of the electric double layer theory can be found from Hunter (1981) or 
Israelachvilli (1992).    
 The effect of electric double layer is minor for the application of dielectorphoresis to 
particles above micron size, but it could be important for nano-sized particles. The forces and 
torques associated with generalized dielectrophoresis are routinely exploited to move and 
manipulate particles in the range of 1 – 10 μm (size of cells) using electrodes with spacing 
100 μm (Jones, 2003b). It is wondering whether we can manipulate submicron particles in 
1980s because the force associated with the Brownian motion increases as the size of the 
particles decreases. Indeed, Pohl (1978) speculated that particles smaller than 500 nm would 
require excessively large electric fields to trap against the action of Brownian motion. 
According to the classic theory (Jones, 1995), the quasistatic average dielectrophoretic force 
on a spherical particle with radius a in an unbounded medium with permittivity mε  subjected 
to an ac field is (Jones, 1995) 
         
3 22 ,                                                                     (1)( ) m r rmst a K Eπε

where rK  is the real part of the Clausius-Mossotti factor, and 2rmsE  is the mean square of 
the field magnitude. The dielectrophoretic force is proportional to the product of 3a  (which 
is proportional to the particle volume) and 2rmsE∇  (which is proportional to 2 3/V L , with V

applicable for nano-sized particles under generalized dielectrophoresis. Such a theory is 
required for both understanding the behind physics and designing more efficient devices for 
nano-particle manipulation.  
  Besides the effect of Brownian motion on nano-particle manipulation, electroconvective 
flow may also have influence under some specific situations (Castellanos et al., 2003; Ramos 
et al., 1998), as well as other surface forces (Israelachvilli). Analysis of those forces is 
required for a successful particle manipulation. As generalized dielectrophoretic force and 
torque were proved to be capable of manipulating nano-sized particles according to the 
previous literature, it is required that we have a quantitatively reliable theory for calculating 
those force and torque, so that we can work out how large are the effects from other forces 
and torques, and design more efficient devices. The theme of the present project is to develop 
a theory for correctly predicitng the generalized dielectrophoretic force and torque on 
nano-sized particles, which is a first step toward a successful nano-sized particle 
manipulation.   
  A recent review on the theory of the effect of electric double layer on the particle 
polarization was given by Zhao (2011), which is published in September 2011 (published 
online at August 8, 2011), after the present project has been started. We are sorry that we 
have missed some of the work reported in that review paper when we wrote our proposal 
around December 2010. It did provide information about part of the result of one of our 
proposed work in the project, which is the effective dipole moment of the linearized problem 
under an applied ac field. Thus we applied directly the result of the effective dipole moment 
to derive the dielectrophoretic force and torque equations, and the result is shown in Section 
V. In addition, as the current existing theory is under linearized theory, we carried out 
numerical calculation of the full nonlinear problem subject to an applied dc field, and the 
result is shown in section II o IV. Finally, we proposed a method for the measurement of the 
real part of the Clausius-Mossotti for submicron particle, fabricated the associated device, and 
performed the experiment. Details are shown in Section VI. Finally, a conclusion is made in 
Section VII.     
 
(II) Theoretical model 
In the classical model of dielectrophoresis, polarization of electric double layer (EDL) is 
reasonably disregarded in the situations at low surface charge density and dense ion bulk 
concentration, which may result in a thin EDL. It is not the case if the EDL thickness is 
comparable to the particle radius, or there exists a dense immobile charge distribution on the 
surface of the particle. 
Recently, it attracts more attention to apply dielectrophoresis to a nano-scale particle, and there 
occur many anomalous and unanticipated phenomena which cannot be explained by the classical

Equation (4) is the dc version of equation (1). Here the Clausius-Mossotti factor is explicit

with mσ  and pσ  the conductivity of the surrounding medium and the particle, respectively. 
For polystyrene particles in aqueous solution (even in de-ionized water), which is employed 
frequency for many dielectrophoretic study, mσ  is much greater than pσ . The value of K 
approaches to −0.5. However, as the ratio of EDL thickness to the particle radius, α, increases, 
the applied electrical field drives the co-ions and counter-ions toward the south and the north pole, 
respectively, within the EDL and bulk medium. The effect of a translating particle tends to reduce 
the above inhomogeneous ion concentration. Both the applied electric field and the particle 
velocity attribute to the effective dipole moment associated with the EDL effect, and the resulting 
effective dipole moment may differ from equation (2) according to the classical theory. Equation 
(5) is no longer valid when the contribution from the EDL effect is sufficiently large. A full set of 
equations using the NPN model is needed for studying the EDL effect on the Clausius-Mossotti 
factor. Table I lists the symbols and units used for the NPN model in the present study, which is 
required for illustrating the NPN model in the following. 
 The macroscopic NPN model is a powerful tool. Being a first principle in the micro-fluidic 
system, the intrinsic nonlinearity and coupled dependent variables make it cumbersome to 
handle and analyze. Hence, some assumptions are adopted to reduce the degree of complexity of 
the present study:  
(1) The directions of the applied electrical field and the particle velocity are parallel such that 
the field variables are of azimuth symmetry. This assumption simplifies the three 
dimensional problem to a two dimension one. 
(2) The applied electric field is of direct current (dc) such that the time independent problem is 
preferred in this study. 
(3) The fluid flow is incompressible and the Reynolds number is much less than unity. 
(4) The particle is spherical, insulated and negatively charged. 
(5) The diffusion coefficient of co-ion and counter-ion are assumed to be the same.

The motion of particle ascribes to time dependent field problem but if the moving velocity is 
small (such that the Reynolds number Re << 1), the problem can be transferred to a time

1. Construct Geometry  
Assume the particle of radius a is moving in the (opposite) direction of the applied external 
electric field. Hence the field variables are only dependent on coordinate r and θ. A simulation 
domain is shown in Figure 4, with the inner boundary at the particle surface and the outer 
boundary locating at r = r0 = 20a in the present study. 
 
2. Apply NPN Model 
Models of pair of Nernst-Planck equations without electro neutrality (variable, C+ and C-), 
Electric statics (variable, V) and Stokes flow (varables, U , P) models are chosen from model 
library of Comsol, which theoretically correspond to those described by equations (7) to (11). The 
boundaries relevant to equations (12) to (17) are also set up. Because all variables are coupled, 
nonlinear solver is selected and initial guest is set to zero and updated in every nonlinear step 
until all field variables converge. The convergent criterion is set such that the relative error is 
below 10-6.  
 
3. Mesh  
The minimum mesh element is the smaller value of 0.01a and 0.05λ to ensure sufficiently 
dense elements distributing inside the EDL.   
  
4. Post Processing 
The field variables including electric potential, velocity field, and charge density are sketched 
by post process unit of Comsol. The Clausius-factor, K, can be calculated by curve integral along 
a longitude if electric potential is solved.

2. Clausius-Mossotti Factor for an Immobile Spherical Particle  
The Clausius-Mossotti factor for an immobile particle can be calculated using equation (18). 
The present numerical results from solving the NPN model, in the range of small λ/a (<0.1), 
agree with the estimation of (linearized) thin EDL model using equation (19). Figure 6 shows that 
the Clausius-Mossotti factor, K, approaches -0.5 as λ/a approaches zero. In this situation, the 
classical theory of polarization is recovered. As the EDL becomes thicker, the upward electrical 
field drives the counter-ions to travel along the particle surface, stack in the northern region and 
extrude in the southern region. As a result, the movement of ions attributes to an asymmetric 
charge distribution and in the far field, it looks like a positive dipole moment. Moreover, the raise 
in surface charge provides more counter-ions to move such that K is increased substantially. For 
example, K is increased two-folds for λ/a = 10 when ( ) ( )0 0/ mF Eσ ε  is large, as shown in Figure 6.

4. Flow Pattern  
 The flow field generated by the ionic movement around a fixed particle, normalized by the 
osmotic velocity, 0( )osU Eεξ η− , is shown in Figure 11(a) for a medium with z+ = z- = 1, σ0  = 
10-8 mol/m2, and N = 10-4. A negative charged particle is associated with a negative zeta potential, 
attracting positive ions (counter-ion) nearby. The flow field is lugged by Coulomb force if there 
exists an external electrical field. The disagreement with prediction of theory, Uo, is due to the 
thick EDL ( / 5.62aλ = in this case). In this situation, the surface of particle cannot be treated as a 
flat plane and flow momentum is not only generated by external field but also by the immobile 
surface charges. The counter-ion and co-ion are deviated from moving along the applied electric 
field direction that reduces the osmotic flow. According to Figures 11(b) to 11(g), the flow field 
far from particle is approximately a superposition of velocity of particle and that of osmosis. In 
the nearly field, there exists a vortex if the velocity of particle is of the same order of osmosis but 
along the opposite direction. Moreover, the maximum velocity of flow field occurs at the surface 
of particle if the opposite directional velocity of particle is overwhelming that of osmosis. 
Regardless of the above cases, the maximum velocity appears in the far field.  
 
5. Concluding remarks 
 In this study, the polarization of a movable insulated spherical particle is analyzed 
numerically by solving the NPN model from the case of a thin to a thick EDL. The dipole 
moment can attributes to the movement of particle and redistribution of counter-ions and co-ion 
in EDL. In a weak electrical field and particle velocity, it is a linear combination of these two 
contributions. Therefore, the dielectrophoresis force and torque can be reformulated by the linear 
response theory,

The second terms on the right hand sides of equations (23a) and (23b) are not anticipated in the 
classical theory, which could be important for some micro-fluidic applications for handling 
nano-sized particles.

the application of electrorotation and traveling wave dielectrophoresis.  
When a spherical particle with radius a is immersed in an unbounded medium subject to an 
electric field as that shown in equation (24), the particle is polarized and can be replaced by an 
effective (point) dipole moment at the particle center through electrostatics as (Jones, 1995; Lo 
and Lei, 2009)

The effective dipole moment, ,m  is evaluated using the magnitude and phase components of

experiences a force and a torque in an electric field as discussed in the textbooks of 
electromagnetism (Stratton (1941), for example). For an ac field, the time average force and 
torque can be expressed as (Jones, 1995)

hyperbolic electrodes composed of 30 nm chromium and 100 nm gold layers are fabricated on the 
glass substrate with tip to tip distance, 2L, equal to 80 µm. The micro-channel manufactured by 
soft lithography process contains 6 trapezoid blocks in the inlet and outlet to stabilize the flow 
and a test region 1.5 mm wide as indicated in Fig. 12(a)-(c). To confirm an asymptotic two 
dimensional in-plane electric field in the test region, the channel height should be much shorter 
than the tip to tip distance of electrodes. If this is the case, the 3-dimensional electric field near 
the electrode edges is deflected by the insulated walls, i.e., glass substrate and 
polydimethysilloxane (PDMS), to build up an approximate 2-dimensional electric field in the test 
region. Also, Stokes drag for a spherical particle in the infinite domain is applied; therefore the 
channel height should be designed much higher than the particle diameter to avoid the wall effect 
contribution. As a result, the channel height h is chosen as 11.2 µm. Because fabricated electrodes 
are planar, the electric potential in Eq. (38) should be corrected by a factor Ccorr, equal to 0.782 
estimated from numerical simulation. Then, the 2-dimensionally corrected electric field intensity 
is in good agreement with the numerical one in the region far from the electrode edges as 
illustrated in Fig. 13(a)-(d). The electric field intensity nearly independent of z-coordinate as 
r-coordinate is smaller than 0.5 L, equal to 20 µm limits the region where the particle should be 
constrained.

The introduction of Ks in MWO theory treats the ions transportation in EDL as a surface 
conduction current balanced by bulk conduction current. If the frequency is decreased close to the 
bulk diffusion characteristic frequency, by definition D/R2 equal to 8 kHz for R=0.5 µm and D = 
2x10-9 m2s-1, the surface current is balanced by both bulk conduction and diffusion current. In this 
case, MWO theory cannot be used. Consequently, the frequency 50 kHz is chosen as the lower 
boundary of ac signals in our experiments. The particle trajectory as exhibited in Fig. 12(d) is 
recorded at a 60 frame rate for at least 180 seconds by a CCD camera with a resolution 640x480. 
The corresponding length per pixel is 0.13 µm for a 100X objective lens. The total number of 
picture captured in an individual experiment is exceeding over 10800 frames. The experiment is 
conducted at least 5 times for each frequency. The position of a particle is traced by calculating 
the correlation factor among sequentially pictures using Matlab code. The probability density f(r) 
is statistically evaluated by enumerating the appearance of the particle in the ring with radius r 
and a constant thickness Δr and then dividing it by the infinitesimal area element, 2πrΔr and total 
sample points N. The dimensionless probability density πR2f(r) is exhibited in Fig. 14(a)-14(c). 
The spring constant Ksp is regressed by least square method and then Kr is evaluated according to

(VII) Conclusion 
We have accomplished the following works: (1) We have proposed the force and torque 
equations both in infinite medium and in the vicinity of wall for generalized dielectrophoresis 
based on the linearized theory of effective moment in the literature. (2) For the dc case, we have 
carried out detailed numerical calculation from α = 0.02 − 10 for spherical particles under the 
NPN (Nernst-Poisson-Navier) model for understanding the detailed nonlinear effect on the 
problem, where α is the ratio of the electric double layer thickness (λ) to the particle radius. The 
present results may find applications in the manipulation and characterization (both simulation 
and experiment) of nano-sized particles in micro-fluidic systems, in biomedical detection, and in 
the understanding of interfacial Science. (3) We have proposed a method based on Boltzmann 
statistics, and fabricated the associated device for measuring the real part of the 
Clausius-Mossotti factor of a Brownian particle. The device contains a polydimethysilloxane 
micro-channel and hyperbolic electrodes which generate a 2-dimensional spring-like 
dielectrophoretic force empolyed for measurement. The data necessarily measured in the device 
is the in-plane distribution of the particle position. Following the Maxwell, Wagner and O’Konski 
theory, the surface conductances Ks of the polystyrene particle in different potassium chloride 
concentrations equal to 0.34, 0.82 and 3.55 mM are 1.01, 1.43 and 3.18 nS, respectively, based on 
the measurement of the Clausius-Mossotti factor. Further analysis of particle zeta potential and 
surface conductance of Stern layer agrees well with the literature
