ARTICLE IN PRESSIn order to help the pathologist to identify the lesions,
we performed needle localization of the lesions in the
specimens by ultrasound guidance as a routine procedure.
A hook-shaped ended stilette was inserted into the above
ROI with visually similar echotexture through a needle. A
pathologist followed the stilette to identify the lesion and
also to evaluate the corresponding similar histopathological
finding in the ROI around the end of the hook. Fig. 1 shows
an example of ROI with similarity both in echogenic pattern
(Fig. 1A) and in histopathological feature (Fig. 1B).

For each patient case, the ROI was used for sonographic
textural analysis, and the corresponding histopathological

and 2.2.
2.1. Textural analysis of sonographic image
In this article, statistical feature matrix (SFM) is
employed for texture analysis as in Chen et al.'s study [6].
The algorithm of the SFM is described in the following [9].
Let δ=(Δx, Δy), where Δx and Δy are integers representing
the intersample spacing distance vector. The δ dissimilarity
is defined as
d dissimilarity :
DSSðdÞuEfjIðx; yÞ  Iðxþ Dx; yþ DyÞjg; ð1Þ
where E{} denotes the expectation operation and I()
indicates an image.An SFM, Msfm is a matrix whose element (i, j) is the δ
statistical feature of the image. Based upon the SFM, the
dissimilarity used in this article is defined as
Dissimilarity ¼
X
ði; jÞaNr
DSSði; jÞ=n; ð2Þ
where Nr is {(i, j): |i|,|j|≤r} and n is the number of elements
in Nr. For completeness, see Appendix A. Microsoft Visual
C++ in a PC-based Windows environment was used to
implement the above image feature analysis. The ROI with
visually similar texture corresponding to the needle localiza-
tion area in the sonographic image was selected manually
(Fig. 1A), and then, the dissimilarity value of the ROI
was calculated.
esults corresponding to the needle localized area in the ultrasound image are
areas as shown in Fig. 3.The texture feature with lower dissimilarity may be
considered as the image with the gray levels of most points

ARTICLE IN PRESSThe texture analysis method for ultrasound image
characterization is based on an SFM. The advantages of
using SFM for texture analysis are that SFM takes both the
local and global spatial gray-level distribution into con-
sideration, there are fewer factors to be controlled, and the
derived parameters are simple, concise, and effective. It is
very useful to characterize the sonographic texture, and its
related parameter (dissimilarity) will not be significantly
affected by the imaging system settings [6].
The combinations of the hue and luminance components
for the color histopathological image are demonstrated to be
very effective in extracting the cellular or fibrotic compo-
nents. It is an interactive procedure for the user to select the
ROI and to adjust the luminance and hue until all the target
tissue is selected (Fig. 2). The same concept can be used in
the selected portion of images (subimage) to alleviate the
nonuniform illumination (Fig. 2B), and then, these sub-
images are integrated for the whole image (Fig. 2C).
For the ROIs with similar echotexture in this study, the
dissimilarity ranges from 1.88 to 7.04. It implies that these
regions contain the most fibrotic cancerous tissue to the most
cellular cancerous tissue as shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The
dissimilarity values of cancerous regions versus variable
content of cellularity and fibrosis all fit the linear regression
model well with good correlation coefficients as shown in
Figs. 5 and 6.
Various mixtures of tumor cells and fibrous stroma can be
observed in different tissue types, including tumor nests
(Fig. 1B), papillary growth of tumor cells, and intraductal
tumors (Fig. 7). All types are well fitted with their
sonographic textural feature and can be used to predict
tissue components. The maximum absolute value of
studentized residual in the regression analysis was 2.1.
This occurred in the prediction of cellularity of a patient with
large intraductal tumors (Fig. 7). This value can be attributed
to an uneven and regional distribution of the intraductal
tumor cells indicated in their corresponding ultrasound
image. The results show that a dissimilarity value of 1.88 for
the area in the ultrasound image may have a histopatholo-
gical component of almost all fibrosis (95.23% in our study).
On the contrary, for a value of 7.04, the cellular content can
reach a value of up to 91.33%. Examples are given in Figs. 3
and 4. Inside this range, if the dissimilarity value increased
by 1, it may reflect a 10–20% increase in the cellular content
or an 11–21% decrease in the stromal fibrosis of the
corresponding area.
Another B-mode compact linear array probe with an
operation frequency for 5–10 MHz was used to study other
breast imaging system settings. The parameters are set as
follows: a dynamic range of 55 dB, six 2D gray maps, a
medium persistent rate, and a medium 2D frame rate [8]. The
ultrasound images for 10 recruited patients were acquired
and analyzed. The result of regression for all the data is still
well fitted by a linear model as shown in Fig. 8. The
correlation coefficients are almost the same (.81 between

proposed breast model to other types of lesions is
anticipated. Little attention has been given to the above
points; our preliminary study should be very helpful in
subsequent research.

Appendix A. SFM and textural dissimilarity
The algorithm of the SFM is described in the followingmay be tolerated.
Further research is necessary for the clinical application of
this study. Although the results can apply to most breast
cancers composed mainly of cellularity and fibrosis, the
combination of other effective sonographic textural features
and the quantitative correlation between them and other
types of lesions are an important subject. Besides, because of
the retrospective nature of the study, future studies with a
larger sample size should be conducted.
5. Conclusion
In summary, the proposed quantitative correlation
between sonographic texture and histopathology in this
study provides several advantages over traditional sonogra-
phy. First, the quantitative characterization of the internal
echoes of breast masses may be obtained instead of
subjective characterization. Second, the histopathological
image analysis has been developed and used to find the
cellular and fibrotic components of cancerous tissue. Third,
we observed that the extracted textural features were closely
correlated with their histopathological findings. A good
correlation between the textural feature (dissimilarity) and
the histopathological tissue components such as fibrosis and
cellularity for the breast cancer was obtained. Finally, the
amounts of the pathological components for breast cancer
are estimated by applying sonographic analysis and the
proposed regression models. Cellular portions of the tumor
increase echogenic speckle and, hence, increased dissim-
ilarity value in sonography. They are easily accessed and
provide more medical information and should be the targets
for ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration, biopsy, or
therapy. The dissimilarity value can also be used to monitor
the progress of the disease. The change of the value implies
the shift of cellular and stroma amounts inside the lesion.
Since most histopathological specimens can be divided intodissimilarity and normalized fibrosis). The results indicate
that the proposed method may be possibly extended to other
commercial types of breast ultrasound system. A reasonable
