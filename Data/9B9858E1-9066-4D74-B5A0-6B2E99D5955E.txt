polymerization. Then the MWNT-PPy conductive 
composite was blended with EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate) 
pellets by the mixer (Brabender Plasti-Corder PLE-330) 
to form polymeric composites which owned the EMI 
shielding effectiveness. 
 
Experiment 
1. Modification of MWNT with PPy 
MWNT-PPy composites were synthesized using in 
situ chemical oxidative polymerization [7]. In a typical 
synthesis experiment, 0.2mol (54.06 g) of FeCl36H2O 
and 0.01mole (3.64g) CTAB dissolved in 200 ml of 0.1N 
HCl solution with stirring for 30 min, then various 
content of MWNT was added to the stirred mixture. 
After ultrasonic treatment, the freshly distilled Pyrrole 
was slowly added drop wise into the stirred oxidant 
solution. The oxidant/pyrrole molar ratio was 2.3 as 
recommended by Myers [8] and Armes [9], which is the 
optimal value. The polymerization was carried out for 4 
h at 5 ℃  with moderate stirring. The precipitated 
MWNT-PPy was filtered and rinsed several times with 
distilled water and methanol. The powder thus obtained 
was dried in Heat Oven at 50℃ for 6 h. After drying, the 
powders were pulverized and drying again in vacuum 
oven in order to evaporate residual hydrosphere. 
2. Compounding  
The polymeric matrix used in this study was 
EVA(Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate)-659, for the reason of 
lower melt temperature and the better mechanical 
properties (Table 1). The EVA pellets were dried in an 
oven at 45℃ for 3h. After drying, 30g of EVA pellets, 
various qualities of conductive fillers and process 
additives were pre-mixed before compounding 
(Brabender Plasti-Corder PLE-330). The blending 
temperature was set at 90℃. In the feeding stage of filler, 
the rotation speed was 15rpm (Revolution per Minute, 
rpm). Then the rotation speed was increased up to 30rpm 
for 10 min. 
3. Compression Molding 
The composites obtained from the compounding 
processes were sent into the frame, delivered into a pair 
of plates and were molded to prepare a variety of 
specimens for testing. The hot-compression-molded 
processes were kept at 100℃ and were subjected to 
three step pressures：0, 1000, and 2000 psi-applied for 6, 
2, and 2 min. When ultimate step was finished, the 
specimens were cooled down with flowing water until 
the temperature fell below 40℃. 
 
Results and Discussion 
1. Synthesis of the conductive fillers 
   Aldissi et al. [10] mentioned that the undissociated 
molecules of surfactant appeared to be thickly absorbed 
on the PPy surface in the polymerization process so that 
it might act as the steric stabilizer. The presence of the 
steric stabilizer led to the increase in yield, and the 
decrease in particle size and resistance of PPy. For this 
reason, PPy was synthesized by in situ chemical 
oxidative polymerization using cetyltrimethylammonium 
bromide (CTAB) as the cationic surfactant for the 
formation of PPy spherical nanoparticles in this 
investigation. Figure 1(a) showed that the particles sizes 
of PPy with cationic surfactant adding were smaller than 
that of without cationic surfactant adding in the same 
polymerization process. The average diameter of PPy 
spherical particle was about 43 nm. Meanwhile, we tried 
to synthesize the MWNT-PPy composites containing 
core (MWNT)–shell (PPy) structures with the cationic 
surfactant CTAB by chemical oxidative polymerization 
method. Figure 1(b) clearly showed that the MWNT 
surface were coated by PPy powders, and the thickness 
of the composites was from 35 to 50 nm.  
 
2. Electrical properties measurements 
It was mentioned that the EMI shielding of 
composites increased with the decreasing of electric 
resistance of filler [10]. Thus, the surface resistance of 
MWNT-PPy composites was one of the important factors 
to affect the conductivity of fillers. The 
room-temperature resistances of the MWNT and the PPy 
shield EMI mainly through the surface reflection. As 
suggested by Y.K. Hong and M.S. Kim [14], the 
contribution of the absorbance or the reflectance to total 
EMI SE should be controlled by the appropriate array of 
high conducting and low conducting materials. Therefore, 
we studied the effect of MWNT-PPy content on 
absorption loss of composites.  
Figure 7 showed that the reflection loss (s11) and 
transition loss (s12) on EMI SE were changed by various 
contents of MWNT-PPy/EVA composites. When the 
MWNT content in MWNT-PPy/EVA composites 
increased, the reflection loss was trended decreased. The 
increase reflection loss of must be due to shallower skin 
depth of the composite with higher electrical 
conductivity [14].  
According to the analysis of S-parameters, the 
transmittance (T), reflectance (R), and absorbance (A) 
could be described as  
 Tr =∣Et/Ei∣
2 
=∣S12 or(S21)∣2                                      
Re=∣Er/Ei∣
2 
=∣S11 or(S22)∣2                                      
Ab = 1- Tr - Re                                                              
 
where, Re and Tr are the square of the ratio of reflected 
(Er) and transmitted (Et) electric fields to the incident 
electric field (Ei), respectively. As shown in Figure 8, 
shielding efficiency by reflectance (Re) increased with 
increasing content of the conductive fillers, while 
shielding efficiency by absorbance (Ab) decreasing. M. S. 
Kim et al. [14] suggested that the increase of EMI SE 
(S12) with the electrical conductivity resulted 
dominantly from shielding by reflectance rather than 
absorbance. Consequently, the EMI SE and the 
absorbance/reflectance of the shielding material could be 
controlled by the area and the array of the high 
conductive MWNT powder and low conductive PPy 
powder. 
 
6. Influence of Sample Thickness on Absorption loss 
In this experiment, the composites prepared using 
the same method was used to achieve the increase the 
thickness of the composites. Figure 9 showed that the 
thickness of sample affected the EMI shielding as the 
content of fillers was fixed. The effect of the composite 
thickness on the EMI SE was analyzed based on a 
single-layer calculation, proposed by Hewlett [15]. For a 
single layer, the theoretical EMI SE can be written as  
EMI SE(dB)≒20log(1+1/2σdZ0)   [16] 
Where σ is conductivity; d, the thickness of the sample; 
and Z0; the free-space wave impedance. From the 
theoretical results, the EMI SE was dependent on 
thickness of composites. The EMI shielding of the 
composite increased with an increasing thickness of 
composite, and its EMI SE was 50~60 dB at a sample 
thickness of 4 mm.  
Figure 11 showed that the ratio of absorbance (s11) 
and reflectance (s12) on EMI SE were changed by a 
various thickness of the sample. The absorbance of the 
MWNT-PPy/EVA composite decreased with increasing 
the thickness of composites and reached a minimum at 
approximately 0.08. The reflectance of the 
MWNT-PPy/EVA composite increased with increasing 
the thickness of composites and reached a maximum at 
approximately 0.92. When the sample thickness 
increased to 4mm, the reflection loss was lower than that 
of the others; on the contrary, the transition loss was 
higher than that of the others (Figure 10). It is assumed 
that the probability of the electromagnetic wave, which 
was reflected by one fillers agglomerate and then 
impacted on another fillers agglomerate, would increase 
with the increasing of the thickness of samples. 
 
Conclusions 
    MWNT-PPy composites were successfully prepared 
using the chemical oxidative polymerization. The 
average resistances of the 29 wt % MWNT-PPy 
composites at room temperature were about 150% higher 
than that of the PPy matrix by 4-point-probe method 
measurement. 
The EMI SE of the composite containing 18phr 
MWNT could reach 12 dB. However, EMI SE value 
could be improved obviously to 48~58dB as 75phr PPy
