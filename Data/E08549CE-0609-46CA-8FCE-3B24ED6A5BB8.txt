Fig. 2 Crosshead for the two types of mechanisms thrust
by a ball nut-screw
evolution (DE), or particle swarm optimization (PSO)
are becoming increasingly popular for solving the opti-
mization problems. The evolutionary algorithms are
simple and easy to implement for solving compli-
cated real-world optimization problems. In addition,
there is no need for further demands pertaining to
the gradient or other mathematical characteristics
of the objective function. A new real-coded evolu-
tionary algorithm [4] has been proposed by the first
author of this work for application to the optimiza-
tion problem of the four-bar linkage synthesis. The
new evolutionary algorithm is obtained by combin-
ing the real-valued genetic algorithm (RGA) with the
DE proposed by Storn and Price [5]. Accordingly, this
algorithm will be termed the ‘GA–DE hybrid (evolu-
tionary) algorithm.’ The only difference between the
GA–DE hybrid algorithm and the RGA is in the con-
tent of the crossover. The crossover operation in the
genetic algorithm is replaced by differential vector per-
turbation, with the best individual or some excellent
individuals as the base vectors. Thus, both the main
perturbation of differential vectors and the minor per-
turbation of mutation are used as genetic operators
in the GA–DE hybrid algorithm. The efficiency and
accuracy of the GA–DE hybrid algorithm for the opti-
mization problem of path synthesis of the four-bar
linkage are tested by comparing with the results of the
three cases introduced in reference [6]. The findings
show that much more accurate solutions are obtained
with this GA–DE hybrid method than those obtained
using binary-coded GA, PSO, and DE methods in ref-
erence [6] and an evolutionary algorithm based on DE
in reference [7].
A distinguishing feature of this mechanism design
task, which differs from the path synthesis of four-
bar linkage, is the considerable number of constraints.
Moreover, these constraints are uneven and this makes
the measure of constraint violation a very difficult task.
If the constraints are not proper handling, feasible
solutions will be very sparse. Rather than establishing
an adaptive penalty strategy, a method for the nat-
ural and proper handling of constraints is presented
in this work. Although this optimization problem has
only four design variables, it is, however, a fairly tough
problem. The RGA with arithmetic crossover fails to
search for a better solution. Based on the above, it
can be seen that a proper constraint handling and
a more effective algorithm are equally important for
this design task. Therefore, the aim of this work is
to employ the GA–DE hybrid algorithm together with
proper handling of the constraints for the optimization
design of the dimensional synthesis of the five-point
double-toggle mould clamping mechanism with the
performance of thrust saving for the prescribed input
and output strokes. To show the effectiveness and
efficiency of the GA–DE hybrid algorithm, an RGA
with non-uniform arithmetical crossover [8] is also
applied to this optimization problem. It has been
pointed out [9] that the synthesized solution may be
unusable due to circuit defects or be incapable of
moving. During dimensional synthesis for this design
task, only the initial and final positions of the mould
clamping process are found. Although a synthesized
solution finds the initial and final positions, no guaran-
tee is provided regarding the behaviour of the linkage
between the two positions. A circuit defect denotes
that the linkage cannot move into a region between
the initial and final positions, that is, positions in this
region do not exist for a linkage with a circuit defect.
In this work, a movable two-dimensional sketch of
the synthesized mechanism produced by SolidWorks®
is used to check whether the synthesized mecha-
nism encounters a circuit defect or is incapable of
motion.
2 PROBLEM FORMULATION
Here, the optimization problem is considered as a
mathematical one. Thus, the geometric meanings of
all the parameters will not be explained, if not neces-
sary. The meanings of all the parameters can be found
in the Appendix or references [2] and [3]. Figure 3
depicts a skeleton drawing for the lower half of the
conventional five-point double-toggle mould clamp-
ing mechanism. The solid lines denote the position
during the mould closing operation and the dashed

prescribed range or may assign a design variable equal
to its maximum or minimum value. In this way, the
number of the remaining constraints can be reduced
to 7.
The detailed geometric implications related to the
following constraints can be found in reference [3].

The initial thrust applied to the crosshead is about
3.1 per cent of the necessary maximum thrust for the
original mechanism with an initial constant accelera-
tion of 120 mm/s2 in the crosshead during the mould
closing process. To avoid unsound motion characteris-
tic and consider the initial transmission characteristic,
the following conditions are demanded individually

where a0A denotes the initial acceleration of the mov-
ing platen and F 0o denotes the initial thrust applied
to the crosshead. The mass of the moving platen with
the ejector unit and the moving mould is 220 kg. The
static friction coefficients at the slider connection for
the moving platen and pin joints are both 0.125.
Constraints (2) to (6) belong to the first kind. The
remaining constraints are inserted into the objective
function as a penalty function as follows:
Minimize
fobj = Fo,max + M1q1(X ) (14)
where q1(X ) = 0 indicates that those constraints are
all true and q1(X ) = 1 indicates that one of those con-
straints is false; M1 is a constant with a very large value
that penalizes the objective function when the con-
straint fails. In this work, the value of M1 is set to
1000 kN (to make the fitness zero for the individual
with a violation of constraints).
3 GA–DEHYBRID EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM
The GA–DE hybrid evolutionary algorithm is obtained
by combining the RGA with the DE. Genetic algorithms
are global search techniques based on the concepts of
natural selection and survival of the fittest. The RGA
search process is briefly outlined below. A population
with randomly generated chromosomes is initialized.
Each chromosome (individual) is a candidate solution.
The quality of the individual is estimated by the fit-
ness value related to the objective function. Offspring
are generated using genetic operators, crossover and
mutation, from either one or two individuals (parents).
The parents are randomly selected according to a
probability proportional to their fitness. A population
evolves from generation to generation by selection
pressure and genetic operations.
There are several methods of crossover in RGA, such
as arithmetic crossover and blend crossover (BLX-α)
[10]. There exist a number of other crossover opera-
tions, for example, simulated binary crossover [11] and
fuzzy recombination operations [12]. Beyer and Deb

Gmax = 200; major perturbation rate Pm1 = 0.6; minor
perturbation rate Pm2 = 0.01. The GA–DE, just like GA
and DE, is not completely free from the problem of
premature convergence, especially for difficult prob-
lems. Therefore, 20 repeated runs are executed to find
the best result.
The choice of population size is described below.
First, a population size of 50 is used. This is proba-
bly enough for this optimization problem with four
design variables obtained by estimation from the solu-
tions obtained by the parametric study based on an
exhaustive search. The value of the objective function
(using a population size of 50) serves as a standard to

be compared with the results obtained using smaller
population sizes. Population sizes of 10, 20, 30 and
40 are used in sequence. If the results obtained using
the above population sizes are quite close to the stan-
dard, then the smallest population size is adopted. For
case 1, the result using population size of 10 does not
reach the standard; however, the results using a popu-
lation size of 20 (for the two cases) are very close to the
standards. Thus, a population size of 20 is used. These
results are shown in Table 2.
For a fair comparison, the number of generations
and population size for RGA are the same as the GA–DE
algorithm. The user-supplied parameters for the RGA
algorithm with the non-uniform arithmetic crossover
are as follows: size of population Np = 20; number of
generations Gmax = 200; crossover rate Pc = 0.6; two
mutation rates Pm = 0.01 and 0.1.
The synthesized results for cases 1 and 2 are shown
in Tables 3 and 4, respectively, together with the solu-
tion obtained in reference [3]. For cases 1 and 2, the
GA–DE hybrid algorithm can successfully find a better
objective function value than the RGA with arithmetic
crossover.

GA–DE hybrid algorithm outperforms the RGA with
arithmetic crossover.
The extension of the GA–DE hybrid evolution-
