I. MOTIVATION AND INTRODUCTION
In WSNs, wireless communication is identified as the dominant power-consumption operation, which con-
tinuously intensifies the interest in the development of energy-efficient wireless transmission schemes. Apart
from the energy issue, it is also widely known that most applications of WSNs such as target tracking and fire
detection usually have their particular requirements on ETE QoS. To meet the diverse design goals, cross-layer
optimization schemes are recently proposed to take into account the problems cross physical, medium access
control (MAC) and network layers. Specifically, energy efficient wireless communication schemes can now
be designed to break the limits of layering principle and to jointly solve the routing, scheduling and stream
control problems with the aim of maximizing the network performance.
For the cross-layer design, a MIMO antenna system in the physical layer has the potential to offer multiple
Degrees of Freedom (DOFs) for communications in a station while reducing interference and improving
network throughput, which attracts much attention of recent research on communication [1], [2]. In particular,
it excites several cross-layer design schemes for improving throughput and/or fairness on the MIMO-based
wireless networks [3]–[5]. However, the fact that MIMO could require complex transceiver circuitry and signal
processing leading to large power consumption has been shown to preclude its application to energy-constrained
WSNs. To overcome this difficulty, cooperative MIMO [6] and virtual antenna array [7] are proposed to provide
the MIMO capacity in a network involving only single antenna stations, which is usually called virtual MIMO.
For the virtual MIMO technique, collaborative beamforming (CB) [8] and cooperative transmission (CT) [9]
have been proposed as the communication schemes to fully utilize spatial diversity and multiuser diversity. The
idea behind them is to allow stations to transmit or relay information for each other so that these collaborative or
cooperative stations can create a virtual MIMO network. In this work, it is considered that CB has the promise
of greatly improving network performance by remarkably increasing transmit power gain and by providing
security and interference reduction due to less transmit power being scattered in unintended directions. To
know its characteristic, some related works proposed recently focus on its beampattern characteristics. For
example, the work in [8] uses the random array theory along with the assumption of uniformly distributed
sensor stations to analyze the CB’s beampattern. Similarly, the following work [10] uses Gaussian probability
density function instead of uniform to model the spatial sensor station distribution in a cluster of WSN.
Despite the beampattern analysis, the cross-layer optimizations proposed so far seldom consider the direct
impacts of these beampatterns on the virtual MIMO network. Hence, we pay our attention here on developing a
cross-layer formulation that can accommodate these impacts so as to provide energy-efficient communications
in multi-hop WSNs with ETE traffic demands. The cross-layer design involves power and rate adaptation at
the physical layer, scheduling at the MAC layer and routing at the network layer, seamlessly integrating the
SINR constraint for generating active sets of links. The objective of this work is thus to compute the most
energy-efficient scheduling to satisfy its ETE traffic demand for a set of source-destination pairs. To this end,
we formulate the minimum energy cross-layer scheduling as a linear programming (LP) problem with a column
generation approach to efficiently select its transmission modes toward an optimal solution. Specifically, we
exactly accommodate the most realistic scenario where power and rate are both discrete in the virtual MIMO
network with pure binary integer programming (BIP) that would be harder than LP or mixed BIP formulating
only fixed, variable or partially discrete power and/or rate adaptation for a generic wireless network.

2) Network and Communication Model: The multi-hop WSN in the context is represented by the graph of
G = (V,E), where V denotes a set of super nodes, in which a super node (or simply a node) i concisely
represents a cluster i as shown in Fig. 1, and E denotes a set of links, in which a link {i, j} represents a node
i using the beamforming or multiple-input single-output (MISO) transmission to communicate with node j (or
more precisely CHj). For each link in E, the receive power is considered by
Pr{i,j} =
Pt{i,j}Gt{i,j}Gr{i,j}
γα{i,j}
(
λ
4pi
)
(3)
where Pt{i,j} denotes the transmit power of i, Gt{i,j} the corresponding transmit power gain, Gr{i,j} the receive
power gain, γ{i,j} the Euclidean distance between i and j, and α the pathloss factor. When compared with
non-CB transmissions, it is important to note that the gain Gt{i,j} obtained from (2) is proportional to n2i rather
than ni, as shown in [11], and this is the reason why CB is considered more beneficial. On the other hand,
Gr{i,j} equals one here because the receiving CHj is assumed to have the same isotropic antenna as the other
member stations. Now given Pr{k,j} ,∀k, and ηj that is the thermal noise at CHj , we have the SINR at receiver
CHj due to transmission from node i in the presence of other transmissions to be represented by
SINR{i,j} =
Pr{i,j}
ηj +
∑
k ̸=i,j Pr{k,j}
(4)
The channel capacity of WSN associated with a link {i, j} is a function of SINR on the channel. We assume
that data is coded separately for each link and that the receivers consider unintended receptions as noises. In
this case, each {i, j} can be regarded as a single-user Gaussian channel. Consequently, with W denoting its
bandwidth, the capacity of this link can be obtained by the Shannon theory as [13]
LC{i,j} = W log2(1 + SINR{i,j}) (5)
B. Problem Formulation
1) Energy Consumption of Virtual MIMO with Collaborate Beamforming: To model the energy consumption
for the virtual MIMO with CB transmission (VMIMO-CB), we consider the following two energy components
to be consumed. The first is due to power amplifier, which is dependent on the transmit power Pt, and can be
given by
Ppa = (1 + β)Pt (6)
where β is a factor depending on the drain efficiency of the power amplifier. The second is resulted from the
other communication circuits. As approximated in [6], the circuits for the transmitting mode include digital to
analog converter (DAC), mixer (mix), active filer at transmitter (filt) and frequency synthesizer (syn), consuming
Pct = PDAC + Pmix + Pfilt + Psyn (7)
Except mix and syn, the circuits for the receiving mode include also low noise amplifier (LNA), intermediate
frequency amplifier (IFA), active filter at receiver (filr) and analog to digital converter (ADC). These consume
Pcr = PLNA + Pmix + PIFA + Pfilr + PADC + Psyn (8)
With the above, we note further that VMIMO-CB in fact has two phases for data transmission. The first
is intra-cluster communication phase, which involves a local exchange between the source station such as
CHi and its collaborative neighbors Ci. In this phase, the energy consumption for the power amplifier is
Ppalocal = (1 + β)Pts, where Pts denotes the local transmit power. In addition, this phase requires that when

C. The minimum energy cross-layer scheduling problem (MECLSP)
Now, given the source-destination pairs of M end-to-end communication sessions, {sm, dm}, 1 ≤ m ≤M ,
our aim is thus to find the most energy-efficient scheduling that can jointly consider routing, scheduling and
stream control problems for the WSN operated under the physical layer of VMIMO-CB. To this end, we
consider 1) a rate allocation r specifying the rate rm for each session m, as the stream control variable, 2) a
link allocation vector fm specifying the amount of traffic fm{i,j} of session m routed through link {i, j}, as the
routing variable, and 3) a transmission scheduling vector p specifying time fraction pk
tm
for each transmission
mode T kM , as the scheduling variable. With the above, the Minimum Energy Cross-Layer Scheduling Problem
[MECLSP] can be formulated as follows.

In the set of constraints, (13) represents the conservation law for source nodes to ensure that the net amount
of traffic going out of the source node of a session is equal to that of the end-to-end session rate, where Eoutsm
(Einsm) denotes the set of outgoing (incoming) edges of source node sm. (14) represents the conservation law
for intermediate nodes to ensure that the amount of traffic of a session entering any intermediate node is equal
to that existing the intermediate node, where Eoutv (E
in
v ) denotes the set of outgoing (incoming) edges of node
v ∈ V \{sm, dm}. (15) gives the bandwidth constraint to make sure that the total traffic on a link is no more
than the average link transmission rate. (16) gives the scheduling constraint, forcing that the summation of all
elements in a transmission schedule vector is equal to 1. (17) and (18) simply represent the valid constraints
for link rate and scheduling vector, respectively, and (19) gives the traffic load demand TLm for each session
m. Finally, we note that without limits on the fm{i,j}’s involved, a session m can be routed through different
links, {i, j}’s, towards its destination, which is usually called traffic splittable.
D. Minimum Energy Cross-Layer Scheduling Computation
As can be seen in above, MECLSP is in general a linear programming problem. Its complexity lies in the
computation of the set of all transmission modes. In fact, for the optimal solution, there may exist s = 2|E|
such modes to be enumerated, which is not computationally efficient and should be solved with a method that
6
the restrictions on the VMIMO-CB medium. In particular, we consider that allowing a wireless sensor station
to transmit with arbitrary power and to conduct arbitrary data rate is impractical for implementation. In fact,
a realistic physical design for such a station, e.g., the IEEE 802.15.4 compliant transceiver examined in [16],
can support only several (8 in [16]) radio modes, and each mode is associated with a discrete transmit power.
Hence, it is more proper to consider that each node in the network supports only a number of power levels.
That is, a link {i, j} is only allowed to be active with a power level P pˆ ∈ {P 1, P 2, ..., P pˆmax}. Similarly, it
is only allowed to transmit with a long-haul rate level Rrˆ ∈ {R1, R2, ..., Rrˆmax}. To this end, we introduce
Boolean variable ypˆ{i,j} for the long-haul transmit power of a link {i, j}, having its value of 1 if it transmits at
the power level of pˆ, and 0 otherwise. Similarly, by extending x{i,j} given previously, we introduce Boolean
variable xrˆ{i,j} for the long-haul data rate of a link {i, j}, having its value of 1 if it transmits at the data rate of
Rrˆ, and 0 otherwise. With these variables, the discrete power and discrete rate (DPDR) transmission scheme
can be formulated as the following binary integer programming.

ypˆ{i,j} ∈ {0, 1}, ∀{i, j} ∈ E, 1 ≤ pˆ ≤ pˆmax (31)
In (26) shown above, ζrˆ denotes the SINR requirement for a discrete rate level Rrˆ, and P
pˆ
r{x,y} , and this
equation denotes the receive power for node y when node x uses a discrete power level P pˆ to transmit in the
DPDR scheme. Similarly, (27) denotes the contention constraint. Following that, (28) gives the constraint that
each link can transmit at most a single rate if it is activated, which is specific to the multiple or discrete rate
system, and (30) is used to allow a link to transmit with only one power level. Finally, (29) and (31) involved
simply denote the discrete nature of its rate and that of power (represented by the corresponding Boolean
variables), respectively.
III. EXPERIMENT RESULTS
In this section, we report on numerical results for the cross-layer optimization given previously. As abstractly
represented in Fig. 2(a), we conduct the simulation environment with a network of N = 1200 sensor stations
being divided into kc = 9 clusters or nodes and each of them having Mi ≈ 133 stations randomly distributed
over an area of 2u × 2u, where u denotes the wavelength of carrier to be considered. In the scenario, each
cluster i selects ni = |Ci| = 100 stations for communication and selects the station closest to the centre as

restriction on SINR{i,j} in (4) for LC{i,j} in (5); this corresponds to a fully connected network. Thus, we
examine here at most eight power levels and eight data rates that are widely considered by the standards such
as IEEE 802.11a and IEEE 802.15.4, which already yields 72× 8× 2 = 1152 binary integer variables in the
experiment and consumes our computation time of several hours on average. More specifically, the 3 different
power sets of experiment are now arranged with the combination of 1, 4, and 8 power levels with 1, 2, 4,
and 8 data rates, as shown in Table III. In this table, R1 ≈ 0.693 (Rl1 ≈ 2.391) Mbps, and R2 ≈ 1.386
(Rl2 ≈ 4.783) Mbps are given by 0.4 and 0.8 times the maximum long-haul (local) data rate obtainable in
the network, respectively. The first combination of the first set, i.e., {P pˆ} = {TX8}, {Rrˆ} = {R1} and
Rblocal = Rl1, along with Pts = TX8 given previously represents the FPFR scheme. The other combinations
simply denote the different numbers of powers and rates adopted by the DPDR scheme. In the experiment,
the two dimensions to be explored are the number of power levels and the number of data rates. For the first,
we increase the number of data rates in each power set to observe its effects on the cross-layer optimization.
For the second, we increase the number of power levels to investigate how the increment impacts upon the
system. Despite the aspects, 100 iterations of the column generation (CG) in Sec. II-D are carried out for all
instances of the optimization to be considered.
Figure 3 shows the optimization results to be exemplified, where (a) exhibits rates (Rrˆ’s) and powers (P pˆ’s)
in long-haul, and energy consumptions per bit (Ebt’s), respectively, resulted from 100 CG iterations for the
FPFR scheme, and (b) shows link energy consumptions of sessions 1 and 2, while (c) and (d) exhibit the results
for an exemplified case of the DPDR scheme (4 powers and 2 rates), corresponding to those given in subfigures
(a) and (b), respectively. From Fig. 3(a) we can see that the CG proposed significantly reduces the initial Ebt
nearly by half (%49.9) for the FPFR scheme. This is more clearly demonstrated in Fig. 3(b), where the top
denotes the initial results obtained by solving the master problem at the first run, and the bottom denotes the
final results after 100 CG iterations, while the right shows the results of session 1 and the left shows those of
session 2. Note that, to be viewed concretely, we use the thickness of a arrow-line to represent a link’s Ebt
resulted from the optimization. With such a representation, it can be more easily seen that given fixed power
10
demand for a set of source-destination pairs. In particular, we have exhibited how the most realistic model
to consider discrete power and discrete rate instead of fixed or variable power and/or rate allocations can be
incorporated in our formulation. This allows us to gain insight in the influence of discrete power and rate
control, spatial reuse, routing strategy and session load distribution on the network performance. Specifically,
we have developed a specialized solution based on linear programming and integer programming along with
column generation, and demonstrated the approach in the computational example within a reasonable time
constraint. The experiment results readily showed that the proposed cross-layer optimization is capable on
achieving our design aims, and on providing the valuable viewpoint on how the number of power levels and
data rates can actually impact on the system performance with the cross-layer optimization.
