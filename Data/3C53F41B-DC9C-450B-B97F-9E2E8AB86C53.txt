Abstract—Lung field segmentation in chest radiograph is an essential step for automatically 
analyzing image. There are various supervised methods that perform well. We present an 
unsupervised method based on multiresolution fractal feature vector. The vector characterizes the 
lung field region well. Then, we apply graph cut segmentation with anatomy information to 
obtain a good initial contour. In the end, the final contour is obtained by anatomy-based active 
contour model. The results show the feasibility and good performance of our method.  
Keywords: Lung field segmentation, texture analysis, wavelet transform, active contour model, 
graph cut, fractal geometry. 
 
1. INTRODUCTION  
Segmentation of lung fields in chest radiographs is an important step before further analysis 
applied, such as rib cage detection and lung nodules detection. The improvement of analysis in 
X-ray image is incentive because the chest X-ray image is the most common and low-cost type of 
diagnostic examination.  
Various supervised methods have been applied to the segmentation of lung field. V.Ginneken 
et al. [1] presented a comparative study on various supervised methods including pixel 
classification (PC) [2], active shape model (ASM), active appearance model (AAM) [3]. These 
methods perform excellent and are comparable to second independent human observer. 
Especially, the rule-based pixel classification with post-processing for lung segmentation obtains 
excellent result which even outperforms the result of second observers. However, supervised 
methods require high computation cost. The physical efforts of manual labeling for training data 
increase with the size of training data. Besides, the performance varies with different training 
data.  
In this paper, we propose an unsupervised segmentation method based on texture analysis. 
From Fig. 1, the lung field region presents different texture features compared with the other 
regions. The lung field region which consists of rib cages and lung tissues has rich texture feature. 
Otherwise, the heart region and the vertebra region have less texture feature. Lee et al. [4] 
proposed a robust texture feature extraction method based on fractal geometry and M-band 
wavelet transform. The experimental results revealed the computation method is trustworthy. 
Thus, we applied the feature extraction method to chest X-ray images, and the feature vector of 
lung filed and other region can be distinguished by simple unsupervised clustering. Then, we 
apply graph cut segmentation with anatomy information to obtain the initial lung contour and 
apply anatomy-based active contour model to obtain the final lung contour.  
In the following, Section 2 describes the proposed unsupervised segmentation method. The 
experimental results and conclusions are presented in Section 3 and 4, respectively 
 
frequency band by two-channel filter bank. But there are more information at middle-frequency 
and high-frequency band in the texture images. The M-band wavelet transform is a generalization 
of wavelet transform which can offer a more flexible tiling of time-scale plane. Given a 
one-dimensional signal, it can be represented in terms of the M-band wavelet transform as 
𝒻(𝓉) = ∑ 𝒸J(k)ℳ
J
2⁄ ϕ(ℳJ𝓉 − k) +∞k=−∞ ∑ ∑ ∑ 𝒹ℓ,𝒿(k)ℳ
𝒿
2⁄ ψ(ℳ𝒿𝓉 − k)∞k=−∞
ℳ−1
ℓ=1
∞
𝒿=J       (1) 
where the coefficients are determined by 
𝒸J(k)=〈𝒻(𝓉),ℳ
J
2⁄ ϕ(ℳJ𝓉 − k)〉                      (2) 
𝒹ℓ,𝒿(k)=〈𝒻(𝓉),ℳ
𝒿
2⁄ ψ(ℳ𝒿𝓉 − k)〉                     (3) 
and ϕ(𝓉) and ψ(𝓉) are the scaling function and the wavelet function respectively, 
ϕ(𝓉)= √ℳ∑ 𝒽0(k)k ϕ(ℳ𝓉 − k)                      (4) 
ψℓ(𝓉)= √ℳ∑ 𝒽ℓ(k)k ϕ(ℳ𝓉 − k) for ℓ = 1,2, … ,ℳ − 1.           (5) 
However, to perform M-band wavelet transform only requires the scaling filter 𝒽0(k) and 
ℳ-1 wavelet filters 𝒽ℓ(k) where ℓ = 1,2, … ,ℳ − 1. 
To design the M-band filter band is more complex than the traditional two-channel filter bank. 
Since, Lee et al. [5] proposed a two-level wavelet transform from cascading two-channel and 
three-channel filter bank. In this paper, we apply the M-band filter bank to decompose a block 
into 45 sub-blocks (the original block, four first-level sub-blocks, corresponding four 
original-size-sub-blocks, thirty-six second-level sub-blocks). 
 
2.2. 2 Multiresolution Fractal Feature Vector  
Fractal is first proposed by Mandelbrot to describe the shape and appearance of objects that 
possess repeating patterns when viewed at increasingly fine magnifications [4]. This special 
quality of scale invariance, which shows up in many natural patterns, can be identified and 
quantified by a parameter called the fractal dimension that is strictly larger than the topological 
dimension. It provides a way to numerically measure their degree of boundary irregularity or 
surface roughness. Different fractal dimension values indicate different texture structures in the 
image. Usually, the more complex the texture structure is, the higher its FD value will be. The FD 
has been successfully exploited in different medical image analysis areas [4]. That is, the fractal 
dimension can provide a quantitative measure of a textured image.  
Even though the definition of fractal dimension is straightforward, it is difficult to estimate 
directly from image data. Nevertheless, several methods are available for the estimation of the 
fractal dimension of images. The widely used method is box-counting, which is based on 
covering the intensity surface with boxes of a fixed size. However, its underestimation of the true 
fractal dimension prevented it from being employed. Among the varieties of box-counting 
approaches, a robust box counting method, which covers a dynamic range and can be computed 
efficiently, is adopted herein [4].  
Hence, the corresponding feature vector is given as follows. 
FV = (FD0, FD1,1, FD1,2, … , FDm,1, … , FDm,i, … )                                 (6) 
 𝒲𝓅,𝒯 = {
1 − R𝓅    if   𝓅 ∈ 𝒫 , 𝓅 ∉ 𝒪 ∪ ℬ
0          if   𝓅 ∈ 𝒪
2          if   𝓅 ∈ ℬ
                   (12) 
where 𝒪 is the object hard constraint and ℬ is the background hard constraint. 
 The hard constraint of the object and background constraint comes from the clavicle 
detection. The clavicle detection method combines the feature classification and the anatomy 
information. We find that the texture of the clavicle is different from the surrounding region. 
Besides, from the anatomy knowledge, the magnitude of clavicle edges is higher and the clavicles 
are located at the top region. Hence, we classify the higher edges of top region by texture feature 
vectors. Then, the detected clavicle edges take as the object of hard constraints, and the other 
edges are the background of hard constraints. 
After the graph is completely defined with non-negative edges, we can find the minimum 
cut ?̂? via graph cut algorithm [6]. The cut corresponding to the new region-based classification 
with anatomy information can be computed in polynomial time, as shown in Fig. 3(c). Therefore, 
we find a proper initial contour for the active contour model. 
 
2.4 Anatomy-based active contour model  
We apply Active contour model (Snakes) [7] to obtain a smooth contour located on the 
feature defined by image. It is a popular method to solve the segmentation problem including 
medical images. Xu and Prince [8] proposed the new definition of energy force called gradient 
vector flow (GVF) which can improve the problem of contour initialization and poor 
convergence to concave region.  
However, there are some problems. First, the interference of clavicle edge is critical when the 
initial contour covers small part of clavicle. Second, the high curvature of the corner at the 
bottom of lung field is in conflict with the smoothness of whole lung field contour. Hence, we do 
some adjustment based on the anatomy information. We give the definition of the internal and 
external force in our method.  
The contour points are updated iteratively by the following equation 
xt(s, 𝓉) = αx
′′(s, 𝓉) − βx′′′′(s, 𝓉) − ∇ℰext                 (13) 
where α and β control the first and the second term, which are from the tension and rigidity of 
energy function, respectively. And the vector field v(𝓍, 𝓎) = (𝓊(𝓍,𝓎), 𝓋(𝓍,𝓎))  can be 
computed from 
𝓊𝓉(x, y, t) = γ∇
2𝓊(x, y, t) − (𝓊(x, y, t) − 𝒻x(x, y)) ∙ (𝒻x(x, y)
2 + 𝒻y(x, y)
2)      
 𝓋𝓉(x, y, t) = γ∇2𝓋(x, y, t) − (𝓋(x, y, t) − 𝒻y(x, y)) ∙ (𝒻x(x, y)2 + 𝒻y(x, y)2)  (14) 
We define the edge map 𝒻(x, y) and refine the map from the anatomy information, as follows 
𝒻(x, y) = {
|∇(Gσ(x, y)) ∗ I(x, y)|
2
∙ δ     if 𝓅(x, y) ∈ ℬ 
|∇(Gσ(x, y)) ∗ I(x, y)|
2
       otherwise
              (15) 
where 0 < δ <1.

Abstract 
This paper describes the feasibility of multiple classifier systems on the classification of ultrasonic 
liver images. In general, texture analysis requires feature representation and classification algorithm. From 
a variety of feature representations and classification algorithms, it is difficult to obtain optimal ensembles 
composed of any feature-classifier pairs. This paper proposes an ensemble creation algorithm to form a 
high performance ensemble of features and classifiers. The pattern recognition process was comprised of 
four main stages. The first stage utilized multiresolution analysis to extract intrinsic features of ultrasonic 
liver images. In the second stage, various classification algorithms with diverse feature vectors are trained. 
Based on the trained classifiers, an ensemble is created by the proposed algorithm in the third stage. The 
last stage was concerned with the aggregation of individual classifiers based on diverse fusion schemes. 
The proposed approach was applied to discriminate ultrasonic liver images from three liver states: normal 
liver, cirrhosis, and hepatoma. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach yields an 
effective ensemble of features and classifiers to characterize ultrasonic liver tissue. 
Keywords: Multiple classifier systems; Ensemble of classifiers; Multiresolution analysis; Wavelet 
transform; Gabor filter bank; Classifier selection. 
 
A. 1. Introduction 
Diagnostic ultrasound is a useful clinical tool for imaging organs and soft tissues in the human body 
with no deteriorating effects. Via visual interpretation of B-scan images, a clinician can diagnose the liver 
tissue by observing the brightness and texture compared to surrounding areas. Hence, liver tissue 
characterization using ultrasound apparatus mainly depends on the ability of the clinician to observe 
certain textural characteristics.  
Ultrasound B-scan images present various granular structures as texture. The analysis of ultrasound 
image will lead to the problem in texture analysis [1]. In previous applications of the texture analysis 
algorithms that have been applied to characterize liver diseases, the supervised classification is usually 
adopted. To perform the supervised classification, determining a set of efficient and meaningful features 
for characterizing liver tissue is an important task [2-4]. The performance of pattern classification 
principally depends on the feature representation scheme of input patterns. Usually, diverse classifiers 
based on different feature representation schemes may have different classification. This indicates that the 
combination of them can use the complementary information to yield improved performance. Recently, 
approaches based on multiresolution analysis such as wavelet transform or Gabor filter bank have been 
widely studied and used for texture classification [1-5]. Multiresolution analysis provides a precise and 
unifying framework for the analysis of an image that can locate energy in both the spatial and frequency 
decision process is to produce more accurate and certain result by effectively integrating classification 
outputs from a number of different classifiers. Hence, we compare the different combination schemes, e.g. 
the majority rule, the Borda count, arithmetic mean, and the fuzzy integral [7], to obtain best classification 
results.  
3.1 Ensemble creation method 
 Given a large pool of different classifiers, there is a possibility that at least some subsets of 
classifiers could jointly outperform the best classifier if suitably combined. It is believed that the optimal 
combinations of classifiers should have good individual performance and at the same time sufficient level 
of diversity. The aim of the ensemble creation method proposed in this paper is to create several classifiers 
that with good recognition rates and sufficient diversities. The method provides the answers to which ones 
and/or how many classifiers to select in order to obtain a better combined performance of the selected 
subset. 
 Let  = { 1,  2, … ,   } be a set of L classification algorithms and  = { 1, 2, … ,  } be a set of 
K class labels. We assume that there are M kinds of feature vectors. Accordingly, we may employ L*M 
classifiers to learn the classification task. To use the performance of the classifier with the specific feature 
vector, the mean correct classification rate was defined as  
 ̅i, = [ ̅i, (1)   ̅i, (2) …   ̅i, ( )]
 
                                                  (1)  
where 1  i   , 1     ,  ̅i, (k) is the averaged degree of support given by the ith classification 
algorithm with jth kind of feature vector for the kth class. The total correctly classification rate for each 
classifier was defined as 
 R , =
∑    
∑ N  
                                                                           (2) 
where    is the number of correctly classified samples out of a total of N  from the kth class.  
Based on given individual performances, we can select the candidate classifiers. Their individual 
performances are better than the average performance of classifier pool. This criterion provides a 
minimum performance in the classifier pool. 
Candidate classifiers:   ,  if  R ,

∑ ∑  R ,               (3) 
 Since the main reason for combining classifiers is to improve their performance, a diverse ensemble 
has better potential for improved accuracy. Herein, we define a fitness function of two classifiers as 
follows. 
       (  , ,   , ) = ( R , +  R , ) +  ‖ ̅ , −  ̅ , ‖          (4) 
where   ,  is the ith classification algorithm with jth kind of feature vector and parameter  > 0 controls 
the balance between the two criteria. Hence, the fitness function provides trade-off information between 
accuracy and diversity.  The proposed ensemble creation algorithm was given below.

are calculated and sorted by descending order. Finally, the ensemble with the highest recognition rate is 
selected by forward selection. In the ensemble creation process, the fusion scheme adopts fuzzy integral. 
In this study, the ensemble creation algorithm stops at k=1. The ensemble consists of SVM with fractal 
feature vector based on wavelet transform, SVM with energy feature vector based on wavelet transform, 
and MDC with fractal feature vector based on Gabor transform. Table 1 shows the performance of 
selected ensemble. The result demonstrates that the four diverse combination schemes can effectively 
improve the classification rate. 
For a given classifier, it has an inherent uncertainty with respect to a certain class, which generates 
from both randomness and fuzziness. A classifier may have a clearer conception to a certain class than to 
the others. That is, different classifiers may propose the same decision for a given sample, but the output 
values would be different. And the difference exhibits the cognitive uncertainty of each classifier. This 
suggested that different classifier designs potentially offered complementary information about the sample 
to be classified which could be harnessed to improve the performance of the selected classifier. 
It is evident from the experiments that the ensemble created by the proposed algorithm enhanced 
classification performance. Based on the different classification algorithms and diverse feature 
representations, the ensemble can provide an effective characterization for ultrasonic liver tissue. 
  
V. 5. CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, an ensemble creation algorithm has been proposed according to the recognition rates 
and diversities of feature-classifier pairs. Adopting the ensemble created, we can effectively characterize 
ultrasonic liver tissues. It has been experimentally demonstrated that the aggregation of the classifiers 
leads to better classification results.
