increase. However, once the concentration of Ag was increased to 10.8 at.%, the as-deposited 
Ag-doped Sb70Te30 recording film will become difficult to be initialized.

1. Introduction 
 
Recent researches for chalcogenide memory devices have been focused on the blue-ray 
rewritable optical disks (BDs) and electronic nonvolatile phase-change random access 
memories (PRAMs). A focused laser pulse is employed as a joule heating source for optical 
data storage applications, while a current pulse is used to heat the active layer of electronic 
PRAMs. The amorphous and crystalline states can be distinguished by their pronounced 
differences in optical reflectivity and electrical conductivity to read the recorded data. To 
obtain a phase-change media with larger storage capacity and higher data transfer rate, the 
size of the recording unit should be reduced significantly, and the crystallization speed of the 
phase-change material should be increased. Therefore, eutectic Sb70Te30 fast-growth material 
exhibits the superiority over the nucleation-controlled Ge2Sb2Te5 phase-change material in 
applications for both media when the sizes of the recording units are reduced to increase the 
recording capacity.1-3) However, this material also suffers from its poor thermal stability 
which is detrimental to the archival stability of the media. An effective way to overcome this 
obstacle is doping specific foreign elements, such as Ag, Ge, and In, into the Sb70Te30 
recording film to increase its crystallization temperature.4,5) Although many researches have 
investigated the crystallization behaviors of various element-doped Sb70Te30 recording films, 
none of them showed the detailed effect of Ag and Se doping concentration on the 
crystallization and melting kinetics of eutectic Sb70Te30 recording film, which play important 
roles in the erasure and recording processes. In this study, we quantitatively investigated the 
effects of Ag and Se doping on the crystallization and melting kinetics of eutectic Sb70Te30 
fast-growth recording film. The crystalline structures of various Ag- and Se-doped Sb70Te30 
recording films under thermal annealing at different temperatures and under pulsed blue laser 
irradiation at various powers and durations were also analyzed. 
 
2. Results and Discussion 
 
The chemical compositions of the Ag-doped Sb70Te30 (AST) recording films prepared at 
Ag sputtering powers of 0, 10, 20, and 30 W were measured to be Sb69.9Te30.1, Ag0.8Sb70.5Te28.7, 
Ag4.0Sb68.4Te27.6, and Ag10.8Sb63.1Te26.1, respectively. The chemical compositions of the 
Se-doped Sb70Te30 (hereafter denoted as SST) recording films prepared at sputtering powers 
of 0, 20, 40, and 60W were measured to be Sb69.9Te30.1, Se2.1Sb70.4Te27.6, Se4.8Sb70.3Te24.9, and 
2(c). The formation of microcracks may be attributed the removal of free volume from the 
amorphous structure, the 63% expansion along c-axis due to the formation of Sb2Te3, and/or 
the evaporation of the Sb69.9Te30.1 film at the elevated temperature. Void formation has also 
been observed in the Ge2Sb2Te5 thin film during annealing from 140 to 350oC.7) As the 
annealing temperature was further increased to 400oC, more Sb phase were transformed to the 
Sb2Te3 phase, and the remaining Sb phase would be melted and form melt-quenched 
amorphous phase after the recording film was rapidly cooled down to room temperature, as 
shown in Fig. 2(d). Meanwhile, the microcracks were found to disappear and replaced by the 
melt-quenched amorphous phase because of the filling-in by the melt, followed by rapid 
solidification. After annealing at 500oC, most of the Sb69.9Te30.1 recording film was melted. 
Figures 3(a)-3(d), 4(a)-4(d), and 5(a)-5(d) show the TEM images and diffraction patterns 
of the Ag0.8Sb70.5Te28.7, Ag4.0Sb68.3Te27.6, and Ag10.8Sb63.1Te26.1 recording films before and after 
annealing at various temperatures. Similar to Sb69.9Te30.1, the Ag0.8Sb70.5Te28.7, Ag4.0Sb68.3Te27.6, 
and Ag10.8Sb63.1Te26.1 recording films were amorphous in the as-deposited state. After 
annealed at 200oC, the Ag0.8Sb70.5Te28.7 recording film would crystallize to the rhombohedral 
Sb phase and the Ag4.0Sb68.3Te27.6 and Ag10.8Sb63.1Te26.1 recording films would crystallized to 
rhombohedral Sb and hexagonal Ag5Te3 (P6/mmm, a = 1.35 nm, c = 0.85 nm) phases. As the 
annealing temperature was increased to 300oC, the mixture of Sb, Sb2Te3, AgSbTe2 phases 
were observed in the Ag0.8Sb70.5Te28.7 recording film, and the mixture of Sb, Sb2Te3, AgSbTe2, 
and Ag5Te3 phases were detected in Ag4.0Sb68.3Te27.6 and Ag10.8Sb63.1Te26.1 recording films. 
Many voids were also found in the annealed recording film. As the annealing temperature was 
further increased to 400oC, parts of the Ag-doped Sb70Te30 recording films would start to melt. 
For Ag0.8Sb70.5Te28.7, most of the Sb phase transformed to a mixture of Sb2Te3 and AgSbTe2 
phases. For Ag4.0Sb68.3Te27.6 and Ag10.8Sb63.1Te26.1, in addition to the existing phases, another 
single crystalline hexagonal Ag phase (P63/mmc, a = 0.29 nm, c = 1.00 nm) was observed. 
After annealing at 500oC, most of the Ag-doped Sb70Te30 recording films would be melted.  
Figures 6(a)-6(d), 7(a)-7(d), and 8(a)-8(d) show the TEM images and diffraction patterns 
of the SST recording films before and after annealing at various temperatures. Similarly, the 
SST recording films were amorphous in the as-deposited state, and would crystallize to the 
rhombohedral Sb phase. After annealed at 200oC, the grain sizes of the crystalline phase 
were found to decrease from ~600 nm to 500, 300, and 200nm, respectively, as the Se content 
increased from 0 at.% to 2.1, 4.8 and 6.6 at.%, and part of the rhombohedral Sb phase would 
transform to a mixture of rhombohedral Sb2Te3 and orthorhombic Sb2Se3 (Pbnm, a=1.16, 
b=1.18, c=0.40 nm) phases. After annealed at 300oC, fewer voids were found to develop 
along the grain boundaries in the SST films than in the Sb69.9Te30.1 film since the contraction 
along c-axis due to the formation of Sb2Se3 would be restrained by the expansion due to the 
formation of Sb2Te3. As the annealing temperature was further increased to 400oC, part of the 
film started to melt, and most of the Sb phase was transformed to a mixture of Sb2Te3 and 
Normally, a recording film having lower Tm and Tc/Tm will be suitable for higher recording 
sensitivity and erasure speed.13) Here, the crystallization temperature was defined as the 
temperature at the midpoint of the first reflectivity change, and melting temperature was 
defined as the temperature at the beginning of reflectivity drop at the fourth stage. For the 
as-deposited Sb69.9Te30.1, Ag0.8Sb70.5Te28.7, Ag4.0Sb68.4Te27.6, and Ag10.8Sb63.1Te26.1 recording 
films at a heating rate of 10oC/min were found to be 136 and 396oC, 138 and 420oC, 140 and 
424oC, and 154 and 427oC, respectively. For the as-deposited Se2.1Sb70.4Te27.6, Se4.8Sb70.3Te24.9, 
and Se6.6Sb71.3Te22.1 recording films at a heating rate of 10oC/min, Tc was found to be 147, 
158, and 165oC, and Tm was found to be 428, 432, and 436oC, respectively. Tc/Tm was 
therefore calculated to be ~ 0.6 for all AST and SST recording films. Apparently, doping Ag 
and Se can increase the crystallization and melting temperatures, while remains the reduced 
temperature unchanged so that the archival stability can be improved, but the recording 
sensitivity may be scarified. As a result, there should be an optimum doping concentration of 
Ag and Se in Sb70Te30 recording film to obtain an acceptable archival stability and maintain 
sufficiently high recording sensitivity. The increases in Tc and Tm due to the addition of Ag 
and Se may be explained by the confusion principle and the decrease of covalent character of 
the alloy system, respectively. An alloy system involving more elements will have a lower 
chance to select viable crystal structures and a higher chance of glass forming,14) and therefore, 
will be more resistant to crystallization. The additions of Ag and Se confuse the eutectic 
Sb70Te30 alloy to crystallize resulting in higher Tc. Meanwhile, an alloy or a compound system 
with a higher covalent character of a bond tend to reduce the heat of fusion (ΔHf) by 
stabilizing discrete units in the melt, which in turn reduces the number of bonds that have to 
be broken during melting, leading to a lower melting temperature.15) The percentage covalent 
characters of the Sb-Te, Ag-Sb, Se-Sb, Ag-Te, and Se-Te bonds are estimated to be 99.9, 99.6, 
95.1, 99.3, and 93.9%, respectively. As a result, the bonding energies of the (Ag, Se)-Te and 
(Ag, Se)-Sb bonds are expected to be a little higher than those of the Sb-Sb, Sb-Te, and Te-Te 
bonds, explaining the slightly increase of Tm of the Sb70Te30 alloy with increasing the Ag and 
Se contents. 
The activation energies for crystallization and melting are other indexes to evaluate the 
archival stability and recording ability of amorphous phase change material. To understand 
the effects of Ag and Se doping on the activation energies for crystallization and melting of 
Sb70Te30 recording film, a series of non-isothermal experiments were conducted at different 
constant heating rates. As expected, the corresponding Tc and Tm increased with increasing 
heating rates since less time is available for atomic rearrangements of the constituent elements, 
and less energy is obtained to break the atomic bonds. The relationships between heating rate 
and crystallization and melting temperatures can be expressed by the Kissinger’s formula:16)  
ln(α/Tx2)=C - (Ea/RTx),  (1) 
Here α is the heating rate, Tx is the absolute crystallization or melting temperature, Ea is the 
at temperatures of 10oC below Tc. Typical S-shaped transformation curves composing of an 
initial slowly increase regime, an acceleration rising regime, and a saturation leveling off 
regime were observed in each film. The ln[-ln(1-X)] versus ln(t) plots in the acceleration 
regime (0.25 ≤ X ≤ 0.75) for various AST and SST recording films were shown in Figs. 10(b) 
and 11(b), respectively. A good linear relationship was observed in each case, and the slopes 
of these plots correspond to the Avrami’s kinetic exponents. The kinetic exponents m were 
estimated to be 3.5, 3.2, 2.8, and 1.8 for Sb69.9Te30.1, Ag0.8Sb70.5Te30.1, Ag4.0Sb68.3Te27.6, and 
Ag10.8Sb63.1Te26.1, respectively, and 4.4, 4.5, and 5.5 for Se2.1Sb70.4Te27.6, Se4.8Sb70.3Te24.9, and 
Se6.6Sb71.3Te22.1, respectively. Assumed the grain growth of Sb70Te30 during isothermal 
crystallization is an interface-controlled process, m can be taken as a + bp, where the a 
describes the time dependence of nucleation rate (zero for existing nuclei and unity for 
constant nucleation rate), b is a growth morphology index, and p is related to the growth 
mechanism (p = 0.5 is for parabolic growth and diffusion-controlled and p=1.0 is for linear 
growth and interfacial controlled).22,23) Since the thicknesses of the AST and SST recording 
films are controlled at ~35 nm, and the average grain sizes are few μm, grain growth is 
essentially two-dimensional (2D), giving b=2. For the Sb69.9Te30.1, Ag0.8Sb70.5Te30.1 and 
Ag4.0Sb68.3Te27.6 recording films exhibit linear crystallization behavior, giving p=1. For the 
Ag10.8Sb63.1Te26.1 recording film shows the parabolic crystallization behavior, giving p=0.5. 
Subtracting bp from m gives a=1.5,1.2, 0.8, and 0.8 for Sb69.9Te30.1, Ag0.8Sb70.5Te30.1, 
Ag4.0Sb68.3Te27.6, and Ag10.8Sb63.1Te26.1, respectively, representing that the addition of Ag will 
decrease the nucleation rate of Sb70Te30 recording film and make the crystallization process 
become more growth-dominated. For the SST recording films exhibit linear crystallization 
behavior, giving p=1. Subtracting bp from m gives a=2.4, 2.5, and 3.5, for Se2.1Sb70.4Te27.6, 
Se4.8Sb70.3Te24.9, and Se6.6Sb71.3Te22.1, respectively, representing that the addition of Se will 
increase the nucleation rate of Sb70Te30 recording film.  
According to eq. (3), the appropriate activation energies ΔH for AST and SST recording 
films can also be determined through an Arrhenius plot of the effective rate constant K. Figure 
12(a) and 12(b) show the ln(K) versus (1/T) plots for various AST and SST recording films. 
The slopes obtained by the linear regression fitting give the appropriate activation energies of 
6.9, 6.5, 6.0, 5.0, 9.8, 11.0, and 14.7 eV, respectively, for Sb69.9Te30.1, Ag0.8Sb70.5Te30.1, 
Ag4.0Sb68.3Te27.6, Ag10.8Sb63.1Te26.1, Se2.1Sb70.4Te27.6, Se4.8Sb70.3Te24.9, and Se6.6Sb71.3Te22.1. It 
should be noted that ΔH is not the same as Ec obtained from Kissinger’s plot. Ec can be 
considered as the effective activation energy of the whole process, while ΔH is the sum of a 
times the activation energy for nucleation (En) and bp times the activation energy for growth 
(Eg). Ec and ΔH can be related by ΔH = m ×Ec.21) The values of ΔH/m for Sb69.9Te30.1, 
Ag0.8Sb70.5Te30.1, Ag4.0Sb68.3Te27.6, Ag10.8Sb63.1Te26.1, Se2.1Sb70.4Te27.6, Se4.8Sb70.3Te24.9, and 
Se6.6Sb71.3Te22.1 are calculated to be 1.97, 2.03, 2.15, 2.71, 2.21, 2.43, and 2.59 eV/atom, 
respectively, which are fairly close to the activation energies Ec obtained from Kissinger’s 
plots, demonstrating the consistence with Ranganathan and Von Heimendahl’s arguments. 
bigger when more Ag is doped into Sb69.9Te30.1. For the as-deposited Ag10.8Sb63.1Te26.1 
recording film, Ec/Em has reached a critical value so that the recording marks in zone III will 
be fully covered by the melt-quenched phase. Similar phenomenon was also observed by Lee 
et al. by using in-situ heating the nanometer-sized Sn-Bi particles in TEM.27)
Figures 14(a)-14(d) show the PTE-TEM images of the annealed AST recording films. 
Three different zones could be clearly distinguished in the annealed Sb69.9Te30.1. In zone I, the 
pulsed energy was too low to induce melting of the crystalline background. In zone II, the 
hottest region of the laser pumped mark in the recording film start to melt and formed a 
melt-quenched amorphous phase. As the energy provided by the laser pulse exceeded a 
threshold value, the ablation occurred, as shown in zone III. It was found that as the Ag 
content was increased, zone I would shift toward lower laser powers and shorter pulse 
durations, and zone III would shift toward longer durations. Therefore, a larger region of zone 
II would be formed demonstrating that the recording sensitivity of AST films would increase 
with increasing the Ag content.

1. Introduction 
 
Amorphous Si (a-Si) film, demonstrating the advantages of environmental friendliness and simple fabrication 
process, has been adopted as the recording layer for write-once blue-ray disk.1) However, the recording sensitivity and 
crystallization temperature of a-Si (~700oC) recording film need to be reduced to increase the recording speed and 
lower the recording power.2) It is well-known that metal induced crystallization can dramatically reduce the 
crystallization temperature and shorten the crystallization time of a-Si. As a result, the a-Si/Cu and a-Si/Ni bilayer 
recording films were proposed for use in the write-once blue-ray disk, in which the crystallization temperatures of a-Si 
films induced by thin Cu and Ni metal layer were reduced to 480 and 350oC, respectively. 2, 3) Germanium (Ge) has 
similar physical and chemical properties as Si, however the crystallization temperature of a-Ge (~400-420oC) is much 
lower that of a-Si.4) Accordingly, lower recording power and higher recording speed will be expected for the write-once 
blue-ray disk with a a-Ge/metal bilayer recording film. In this work, we investigated the crystallization kinetics of 
a-Ge/Ni bilayer recording film under thermal annealing. The microstructural changes of a-Ge/Ni bilayer at different 
heating temperatures were examined to illuminate the recording mechanism for write-once blue ray recording.  
 
2. Experimental procedures 
 
a-Ge/Ni bilayer recording films with thickness ratios of 20:1 and 10:1were deposited on Corning 7059 glass 
substrates by an ion beam assisted deposition system. The thickness of a-Ge layer was fixed at 20 nm, while the 
thicknesses of Ni ultrathin films were controlled at 1 and 2 nm. The crystallization kinetics of the as-deposited a-Ge/Ni 
bilayer recording films under nonisothermal annealing was analyzed quantitatively by monitoring the reflectivity 
variation with temperature or time during the heating process. The crystalline structures of the a-Ge/Ni bilayer before 
and after thermal annealing at various temperatures were identified by the grazing incident x-ray diffractometer (GIXD) 
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).  
 
3. Results and discussion 
 
Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show the reflectivity variations with temperature for the as-deposited a-Ge/Ni bilayer 
recording films with thickness ratios of 20:1 and 10:1, respectively, at heating rates of 5, 10, 20, and 40oC/min. For the 
a-Ge/Ni bilayer recording film with a thickness ratio of 20:1, a steep reflectivity increase was found to take place at 
temperatures around 410oC, representing that a structural change occurred. As the thickness ratio was decrease to 10:1, 
the a-Ge/Ni bilayer recording film exhibited a three-stage reflectivity change during the heating process. The first one 
with a slow decrease in reflectivity occurred in the temperature range between 90 and 190oC, the second one with an 
increase in reflectivity took place in the temperature range between 210 and 245oC, while the third one with an abrupt 
increase in reflectivity arose in the vicinity of 390oC, implying that three different structural changes occurred during 
the heating process. To identify the structural phase transition corresponding to each reflectivity change, the structures 
of a-Ge/Ni bilayer recording films before and after annealing at various temperatures were examined by GIXD and 
TEM. Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the GIXD diffraction patterns of the a-Ge/Ni bilayer recording films with thickness 
ratios of 20:1 and 10:1, respectively, before and after annealing at 200, 300, and 500 oC. For the a-Ge/Ni bilayer 
recording film with a thickness ratio of 20:1, the microstructure of the bilayer recording film was amorphous in the 
as-deposited state and remained amorphous after annealing at 200oC. After annealing at 300oC, the formation of NiGe 
phases was observed. As the annealing temperature was further increased to 500 oC, in addition to the existing NiGe 
phases, crystalline Ge could also observed. Obviously, the steep reflectivity increase at ~ 410oC observed in the a-Ge/Ni 
bilayer recording film with a thickness ratio of 20:1 can be attributed to the crystallization of a-Ge. For the a-Ge/Ni 
bilayer recording film with a thickness ratio of 10:1, the microstructure of the bilayer recording film was also 
amorphous in the as-deposited state. After annealing at 200oC, the Ni5Ge3 phases were observed. After annealing at 
300oC, the metastable Ni5Ge3 phases would disappear and transformed to the stable NiGe phases. As the annealing 
temperature was further increased to 500 oC, the crystallization of a-Ge could occur. Figures 3(a)-3(d) also show the 
TEM bright field images and selected area diffraction (SAD) patterns of the a-Ge/Ni bilayer recording film with a 
thickness ratio of 10:1 before and after annealing at 200, 300, and 500 oC for 3 min. Similar to GIXD’s results, 
amorphous Ge and Ni were observed in the as-deposited a-Ge/Ni bilayer recording film. After annealing at 200oC, 
different grains with size less than 30 nm in diameter could be distinguished and new diffraction rings corresponding to 
a Ni5Ge3 phase were found. However, Ge still remained as an amorphous phase. As the annealing temperature was 
increased to 300oC, new NiGe phases were identified from the diffraction patterns. Meanwhile, no c-Ge phase was

content was increased from 0 to 5.3, 17.9 and 34.7 at.%, Ec and Em were determined to be 2.08 and 3.33 eV/atom, 
2.19 and 2.46 eV/atom, 4.09 and 2.25 eV/atom, 4.15 and 2.14 eV/atom, respectively, giving rise to the reduced 
activation energy (Ec/Em) increased from 0.63 to 0.89, 1.82, and 1.94. The increases of Tc and Ec due to Zn 
addition may be explained by the confusion principle. Normally, an alloy system involving more elements will 
have a lower chance to select viable crystal structures and a higher chance of glass forming,[6] and therefore, 
will be more resistant to crystallization. In addition, the Zn+2Te-2 nuclei are expected to restrain the formation of 
the Sb2-3Te3+2 phase due to the opposite electricity of the Te atoms, which will also lead to higher Tc and Ec. The 
increases of Tm and decrease of Em may be explained by the decrease of covalent character of the alloy system 
and the decrease of latent heat of fusion, respectively. An alloy or a compound system with a higher covalent 
character of a bond tend to reduce the heat of fusion by stabilizing discrete units in the melt, which in turn 
reduces the number of bonds that have to be broken during melting, leading to a lower melting temperature.[7] 
The percentage covalent characters of the Sb-Te, Zn-Sb, and Zn-Te bonds are estimated to be 99.9, 96.1, and 
95.1%, respectively. As a result, the bonding energies of the Zn-Te and Zn-Sb bonds are expected to be higher 
than those of the Sb-Sb, Sb-Te, and Te-Te bonds that explain the increase of melting temperatures of the 
Sb70Te30 alloy with increasing the Zn content. Meanwhile, the latent heats of fusion of Sb, Te and Zn are about 
19.8, 17.5, and 7.3 KJ/mol, respectively. The addition of Zn atoms will decrease the latent heat of the ZST 
recording films, resulting in the decreased of Em.  
Normally, the pulsed laser spot exhibits a Gauss spatial intensity distribution with an approximately top-hat 
profile in bulk materials.[8] For nano-scaled thin films, the active region is limited and similar as a 2D situation 
with large plane temperature gradients depending on the laser power. Uhlmann et al. have asserted that for 
congruently melting glass-forming materials, the crystallization velocity at low temperature will be limited by 
the viscosity of the glass forming liquid. Ec can be interpreted as low temperature viscous flow, and regarded as 
the dynamic driving force for crystal front propagation. Em could be interpreted as the high temperature viscous 
flow, and regarded as the dynamic driving force for melt front propagation.[9,10] It is expected that, as Zn atoms 
are doped into Sb70Te30, the laser powers required to initiate crystallization may increase, while the laser powers 
required to form the melt-quenched amorphous marks will decrease. Based upon our previous studies, Ec/Em 
should be controlled at ~1 to achieve smoothly reversible switching between the amorphous and crystalline 
marks. [3,4] As a result, the Zn concentration should be located between 5.3 and 17.9 at.% to prevent the 
divergent of crystalline and melting phases.  
4. CONCLUSIONS 
Adding Zn into the fast-growth Sb70Te30 recording film can enhance the formation of ZnTe compound which 
will retard the crystallization of Sb and formation of Sb2Te3 phase, leading to the increase of crystallization 
temperature and the activation energy for crystallization. The addition of Zn can also increase the melting 
temperature but decrease the activation energy for melting. Accordingly, doping Zn into Sb70Te30 can improve 
the archival stability and recording sensitivity. However, the initialization of the as-deposited ZST recording film 
will also become more difficult. Therefore, it should have an optimization Zn doping concentration for the 
Sb70Te30 film to obtain sufficiently high recording sensitivity and archival stability, while still maintain adequate 
initialization ability. Base upon our results, the optimum Zn doping concentration in the Sb70Te30 recording film 
should be located between 5.3 and 17.9 at.%.
