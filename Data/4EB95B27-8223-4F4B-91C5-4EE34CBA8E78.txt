Abstract 
Organizational procurement is a process of information exchanges and price bargaining 
between buyer and seller.  The process and its outcome are both influenced by the professional 
experience of the relevant agents, the cognition of the agents concerning market risk, the analysis 
of contingency in the bargaining process, etc. Decisions of an enterprise are composed by the 
individuals in the company. How to congregate and motivate the individuals to make good 
decisions for running the business in a company, are challenging issues today. A consulting 
model for the evolution of an organizational market is built, based on literature review of 
inter-organizational negotiations, and in-depth interviews with top-level executives in a few 
leading Taiwanese companies engaged in organizational procurement. An experimental study is 
conducted based on the proposed model, and the empirical data is collected to gain knowledge of 
organizational procurement decision making. TOVE and Protégé are applied in designing the 
ontology for creating valuable information for marketplace administrators building appropriate 
strategies for their businesses.

1 Introduction  
Organizational procurement is a process that includes: information, thinking, and contingency 
exchange and price bargaining between buyers and sellers. The process and its outcome are both 
influenced by the professional experience of the agents, the cognition of the agents concerning 
market risk, the analysis of contingency in the bargaining process, etc. Decisions of an enterprise 
are composed by the individuals in the company: how to congregate and motivate the individuals 
to make good decisions for running the business in a company, are challenging issues nowadays.  
Based on academic studies, human behavior is clearly influenced by the contingency of events 
and the personalities of participators. Many partners are involved in an organizational 
procurement process, and preferences for risk taking and decision making differ greatly among 
members involved in transactions. Therefore, the objectives are two fold:

Purchasing plan  
 
The company recently had a plan to purchase 100 desktop computers with specifications as the attachment. 
Based on the current market price, this kind of desktop is about NT 35,000 dollars. After screening possible qualified 
desktop suppliers, Supplier A and Supplier B passed the screening process. Two suppliers have sent in their quoted 
documentation with the same delivery, quality, and technical support for the installation and maintenances. The 
weight of our bargaining mix in this case is as follows. Delivery: 10%, Quality: 10%, Technical support: 10%, Price: 
60%, Company Reputation: 10%. What will be your choice in five different conditions? 
There are few suppliers available in the market and they are willing to sell their desktops to us. And as we know, 
Supplier A and B both only have our case in their selling listing. And they both have had beautiful cooperative 
experiences with our company during the past two years. Besides, we might have other projects with them in the 
very near future.  
Case 1  
John prefers to discuss more details with Supplier A, because Supplier A is offering 45% choice to sell the 
desktop at NT 29,000/each and 55% choice at NT 35,000/each. Instead of the offer of Suppler A, Supplier B is 
offering 10% choice at NT 35,000/each and 90% choice at NT 32,000/each. Then Al prefers Supplier B. 
Case 2 
John prefers to discuss more details with Supplier B, because Supplier B is offering 90% choice at NT 
35,000/each and 10% choice at NT 29,000/each. But, Supplier B is offering 20% choice at NT 32,000/each and 80% 
choice at NT 35,000/each. Al prefers Supplier B too. 
Case 3  
John prefers to discuss more details with Supplier A, because Supplier A is offering 25% choice at NT 
31,000/each, 25% choice at NT 33,000/each and 50% choice at NT 35,000/each. But, Supplier B is offering 25% 
choice at NT 29,000/each and 75% choice at NT 35,000/each. Al prefers Supplier B. 
Case 4  
John prefers to discuss more details with Supplier A, because Supplier A is offering 25% choice at NT 
32,000/each and 75% choice at NT 35,000/each. But, Supplier B is offering 20% at NT 31,000/each and 80% choice 
at NT 35,000/each. Al prefers Supplier B. 
Case 5  
John prefers to discuss more details with Supplier B, because Supplier B is 100% certainly offering the desktop 
at NT 32,000/each. But, Supplier A is offering 20% choice at  NT 35,000/each and 80% choice at NT 31,000/each. 
Al prefers Supplier B too. 
Based on the personal documentations and the financial risk survey, John is a ST and risk taker, and Al is a SF 
and risk neutral.
