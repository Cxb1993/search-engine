Abstract 
The hydrodynamic and heat transfer 
characteristics of a horizontal parallel-plate 
channel with staggered fin array are 
investigated numerically. Through the use of 
a stream function vorticity transformation, 
solution of the transformed governing 
equations for the system is obtained using 
the control-volume method with 
non-uniform grid. The effects of the 
Reynolds number, Grashof number, thermal 
conductivity ratio of fin to fluid, and 
entrance length on the heat transfer rate of 
fins in the channel are presented. For a fixed 
fin volume, the aspect ratios of fins are 
varied and analyzed to obtain the maximum 
heat transfer rates of transverse fins in the 
channel. With the first fin installed on top 
wall, it is obtained that the optimum fins, 
which dissipate maximum heat transfer, on 
this wall turn out to be a little shorter and 
thicker than those on the opposite wall. 
Identical results can be obtained for the first 
fin placed on the bottom wall. In addition, 
the optimum aspect ratios of fins increase 
with Re but decrease with K and Li with 
other parameters fixed. Finally, the effects 
of fin profile area on pressure difference 
between the inlet and outlet of the channel 
are presented. 
Keywords: Staggered fin array, mixed 
convection, Channel, Optimum aspect ratio. 
I. Introduction 
Laminar mixed convection flow in 
parallel-plate channel is of growing interest. 
This is because the flow velocities and 
passage sizes are small and consequently the 
Reynolds numbers are low. In order to 
enhance the heat transfer rates, fins are 
widely used in heat exchange devices. The 
installed fins may interrupt the growth of the 
boundary layers and the periodic 
replenishment of the boundary layer fluid 
parallel-plate channels with transverse fin 
arrays. Luy et al. [21] studied the heat 
transfer characteristics for laminar fully 
developed flow in a channel with an array of 
fins. Subsequently, Kim et al. [22] 
investigated the fluid flow and heat transfer 
characteristics of mixed convection in a 
channel with protruding heat sources 
mounted on the bottom channel wall. Young 
and Vafai [23] performed a detailed 
numerical study of conjugate forced 
convection in a channel with protruding heat 
sources. In addition, Furukawa and Yang 
[24] carried out a numerical study of forced 
convection from a horizontal channel with 
protruding heat sources. Mousavi and 
Hooman [25] studied the laminar fluid flow 
and heat transfer in the entrance region of a 
channel with isothermal walls and with 
staggered baffles. 
For in-tube flows with an array of 
equally-spaced plate fins attached at the 
outer surface, Campo [26] presented a 
detailed comparative study of the heat 
transfer augmentation. Considering an array 
of vertical fins standing on the top of a 
rectangular channel with a fluid flowing 
inside the channel, Rakshit and Balaji [27] 
proposed the optimum design based on the 
minimum entropy generated by the system. 
Mousavi et al. [28] determined the exact 
location and size of fins in such a way that a 
minimal pressure drop coincides with an optimal 
heat transfer based on the genetic algorithm. 
Lately, Famouri et al. [29] have studied fully 
developed forced convection through a 
variable-height shrouded fin array. The 
effects of thermal boundary condition, fin 
size, spacing, tip clearance, and material on 
pressure drop, heat transfer, and entropy 
generation are explored. 
From the foregoing description, it is noted 
that very little attention has been given to 
the exploration of the optimized fin array in 
a forced convective channel. In this work, 
the fluid flow and heat transfer 
characteristics of a channel flow with 
transverse staggered fin array is studied 
numerically. In addition, it is assumed that 
the flow is hydrodynamically fully 
developed but thermally developing under 
uniform wall temperature conditions. The 
optimum aspect ratios of fins which 
dissipate maximum heat transfer in a 
channel are obtained. A series of parametric 
alterations including Re, K, and Li is 
employed to establish the important 
fundamental effects and provide practical 
results. 
II. Analysis 
Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of 
the channel with transverse staggered fin 
array. A horizontal parallel channel consists 
of two infinite plates with interspacing d, 
and the upper and lower wall are uniform 
with a constant temperature Tw. A series of 
fins are mounted on the two walls and the 
spacing between fins is s. The width and 
height of fins are w and e, respectively. In 
this work, all the fins’ profile areas are 
identical and are assumed constant, A. Inlet 
flow enters the channel at a constant 
temperature To and the velocity profile is 
assumed parabolic as a full developed flow. 
In addition, viscous dissipation is considered 
to be negligible. The flow is assumed to be 
steady, incompressible and two-dimensional. 
Buoyancy induced effects are assumed 
negligible and there is no heat generation 
within the fin. Besides, the thermophysical 
properties of the fluid and fin are taken as 
constants. Introducing the 
non-dimensionalized variables and 
parameters,

the thermal boundary condition at the exit

III Results and discussion 
Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) depict the effects of K on 
dimensionless total heat transfer rate of the 
fins on upper and lower walls in the channel 
for Re=1000. As expected, the 
dimensionless total heat transfer rate, Qt, 
increases with increasing K for a known γ. 
In addition, it is observed that Qt first 
increases to a maximum value then 
decreases with increasing γ at a fixed Re. 
The optimum aspect ratio of the fin which 
dissipates maximum heat transfer is 
designated as γo. It is observed that γo 
decreases as K increases. Also note that γo’s 
for the fins on the lower wall are a little 
higher than those on the upper wall. This is 
possibly due to the downward turn of the 
flow to the area between the first and second 
fin on the lower wall. The maximum heat 
transfer rate is thus obtained for a short and 
thick fin, a fin with higher γo, under the 
strong forced convection. Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) 
plot the effects of Re on Qt for upper and 
lower walls in the channel and for K=200. 
At a fixed K, γo increases with Re. Identical 
to the previous case, γo obtained for the 
lower wall is higher than that for the upper 
wall. The effects of Li on Qt  are presented in 
Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) for Re=1000 and K=200. 
It shows that the optimum aspect ratios of 
fins increase on decreasing the entrance 
length, Li. Moreover, considering the effect 
of entrance length, γo calculated for the 
lower wall is also higher than that for the 
upper wall in the channel.
