larger than multipath number. By this matrix form, we 
can systematically derive and analyze the proposed 
receiver. Also, using this matrix form, we can 
formulate a CSFB matrix to derive the reduced-rank 
MC-CDMA receiver. The weight length of reduced-rank 
MC-CDMA receiver is not restricted to the same length 
of the spreading code. The multiplication of lth row 
of the CSFB matrix and the received signal vector 
acts as demultipath and despreading of lth multipath 
signal. If the tap number of reduced-rank receiver is 
large enough, the linear combination of the 
multiplication results of the CSFB matrix and the 
received signal is possible to recover the 
transmitted signal. In this project, we design a new 
reduced-rank MC-CDMA receiver by the combination of 
our proposed MC-CDMA CSFB matrix and existing 
reduced-rank DS-CDMA receiver. An ＇auxiliary 
vector＇ filter will be presented, which generates 
the same subspace as CSFB filter. We can desire that 
this technique can attain near full-rank MMSE 
performance with a filter rank which is much smaller 
than the dimension of the signal subspace.

一、中文摘要 
 
在本計畫中我們根據循環移動濾波組
推導出一個基本的降秩多載波分碼多重擷
取接收機。關於循環移動濾波組濾波器，
其接收信號是經由一組濾波器處理，每一
個濾波器是由循環移動後的匹配濾波器所
組成。其決定統計是由一個訊符區間的輸
出區樣的線性組合所獲得。由於循環移動
濾波組的維度可以遠小於展頻碼的長度，
因此，此架構比起傳統的最小均方誤差偵
測器容易被採用。在我們於多載波分碼多
重擷取系統的推導中，我們藉由矩陣的相
乘來顯示當正交分頻多工區塊的保護區間
大於多重路徑數情況下其多重路徑和頻率
項的組合。藉由矩陣型式的表示，我們可
以有系統的推導和分析所提出的接收機。
且利用矩陣型式我們也可以制定一個循環
移動濾波組矩陣去推導降秩多載波分碼多
重擷取接收機。降秩多載波分碼多重擷取
接收機的權重長度不被限制要與展頻碼要
有相同的長度。循環移動濾波組矩陣的第
一列與接收信號向量相乘相當於是對第一
條多重路徑信號作解多重路徑及解展頻的
動作。如果降秩接收機的長度足夠大，循
環移動濾波組矩陣與接收信號相乘結果的
線性組合有可能還原傳送信號。在此計畫
中，我們藉由我們所提出的多載波分碼多
重擷取循環移動濾波組矩陣與現存降秩直
序分碼多重擷取接收機的組合來設計出新
的降秩多載波分碼多重擷取接收機。一個
輔助向量濾波器將被提出，此濾波器與循
環移動濾波組濾波器有相同的子空間。我
們可以預期此技術可以在濾波器的秩小於
信號子空間維度的情況下達到與滿秩最小

1. Abstract 
 
In this project, we derive a basic 
reduced-Rank MC-CDMA receiver based on 
cyclically shifted filter bank (CSFB). For the 
CSFB filter, the received signal is 
preprocessed by a bank of filters, each of 
which is a cyclically shifted version of the 
matched filter. In this case, the decision 
statistic is a linear combination of the output 
samples obtained in a symbol interval. Since 
the dimension of CSFB can be much smaller 
than the spreading code length, these 
schemes should be easier to adopt than the 
conventional minimum mean square error 
(MMSE) detector. In our derivation of the 
MC-CDMA systems, we had presented the 
combination of multipath and frequency term 
by the multiplication of matrices in the 
condition of the guard interval of the OFDM 
block larger than multipath number. By this 
matrix form, we can systematically derive 
and analyze the proposed receiver. Also, 
using this matrix form, we can formulate a 
CSFB matrix to derive the reduced-rank 
MC-CDMA receiver. The weight length of 
reduced-rank MC-CDMA receiver is not 
restricted to the same length of the spreading 
code. The multiplication of lth row of the 
CSFB matrix and the received signal vector 
acts as demultipath and despreading of lth 
multipath signal. If the tap number of

reduced-Rank MC-CDMA receiver based on 
CSFB. For the CSFB filter, the received 
signal is processed by a bank of filters, each 
of which is a cyclically shifted version of the 
matched filter. In this case, the decision 
statistic is a linear combination of the output 
samples obtained in a symbol interval. Since 
the dimension of CSFB can be much smaller 
than the spreading code length, these 
schemes should be easier to adopt than the 
conventional MMSE detector. In our 
derivation of the MC-CDMA systems, we 
had presented the combination of multipath 
and frequency term by the multiplication of 
matrices in the condition of the guard 
interval of the OFDM block larger than 
multipath number. By this matrix form, we 
can systematically derive and analyze the 
proposed receiver. Also, using this matrix 
form, we can formulate a CSFB matrix to 
derive the reduced-rank MC-CDMA receiver. 
The weight length of reduced-rank 
MC-CDMA receiver is not restricted to the 
same length of the spreading code. The 
multiplication of lth row of the CSFB matrix 
and the received signal vector acts as 
demultipath and despreading of lth multipath 
signal. If the tap number of reduced-rank 
receiver is large enough, the linear 
combination of the multiplication results of 
the CSFB matrix and the received signal is 
possible to recover the transmitted signal. An 
“auxiliary vector” filter is presented, which 
generates the same subspace as CSFB filter. 
The proposed reduced-rank scheme can 
attain near full-rank MMSE performance 
with a filter rank which is much smaller than 
the dimension of the signal subspace. 
 
3. System Model 
   
Consider a downlink MC-CDMA system 
in multipath fading channels. The 
baseband structure of the MC-CDMA 
transmitter is presented in Fig. 01. The 
frequency-interleaved sequence before 
IFFT operation can be written as

where d
(k)
 is data symbol of kth user, c
(k)
 is 
the spreading code of kth user, and G is 
the spreading code length. The resulting 
chips for the kth user can be implemented 
by taking an IFFT of the outputs of the 
frequency interleaver as t
(k)
=F
H
s
(k)
, where 
F denotes as the Fourier Matrix.. The rth

    A guard interval in the form of a CP 
is added in front of the P/S converted 
samples of the nth OFDM block to avoid 
interference between consecutive OFDM 
symbols. The transmission channel is 
 8 
the similar form as CSFB in [28]. The 
filter output of reduced-tap receiver thus 
can be written as 
y(n)=w
H
(n)Arm(n) 
where w(n) is a z×1 weight vector. An 
adaptive algorithm can be applied into above 
equation to accomplish signal detection. The 
cost function can be constructed as 
 
J(n)=E{|d(n)-y(n)|
2
} 
= E{|d(n)- w
H
(n)Arm(n) |
2
}= E{|e(n)|
2
} 
 
where d(n) is the desired signal, and e(n) is 
the error signal. The above equation can be 
written as  
 
J=E{(d(n)- w
H
(n)Arm(n)) 
×(d

H
(n)Arm(n) 
+ w
H
(n)Arm(n) rm
H
(n) A
H
w (n) } 
 
The gradient of above equation becomes 
 
▽wJ=-2 d*(n)Arm(n) 
+2Arm(n) rm
H
(n) A
H
w (n) 
=-2 Arm(n)e
*
(n) 
 
Applying the steepest descent method, then, 
the weight updated equation is 
 
w (n+1)= w (n)+ μArm(n)e
*
(n) 
 
where μ is the step size. 
 
5. Simulation Results 
 
In this section, we compare SERs of the 
proposed reduced-rank receiver with 
different length of rank. Assume that the 
length of CP is longer than that of multipath 
channel. For comparison, in Fig. 02, we also 
show the SER of full-tap receiver. In this 
figure, we can see that the SER performance 
of reduce-tap receiver can approach that of 
full-tap receiver even if z=G/4 (this means 
that the tap length of reduced-tap equals to 
quarter code length). Also, we can see that 
the SER of reduced-rank receiver can 
improved when the rank length increases.
