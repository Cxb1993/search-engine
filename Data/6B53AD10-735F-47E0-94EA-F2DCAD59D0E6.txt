Abstract 
A new dynamic model of railway vehicle 
moving on tangent tracks is proposed. In the 
new model, the motion of the car body is 
considered and the motion of the tuck frame is 
not restricted by a virtual boundary. Based on 
the linear creep model, the governing 
differential equations of motion for a car 
modeled by a fourteen degrees of freedom 
system, considering the lateral displacement 
and the yaw angle of each wheelset, the truck 
frame and the car body, moving on tangent 
tracks are derived. It is shown that the critical 
hunting speeds evaluated by the six degrees 
and the fourteen degrees of freedom systems 
have great difference. To illustrate the 
accuracy of the analysis, the limiting case and 
the numerical result are compared with those 
in the existing literature. In addition, the 
influences of the physical parameters 
considered in the six degrees and the fourteen 
degrees of freedom system on the critical 
hunting speeds are also investigated.

1. Introduction 
The high-speed railway (HSR) vehicle is one 
of the important transportation systems. 
Particularly with the advent of the high-speed 
passenger trains in Japan, Europe and 
American, the problem of achieving high-
speed operation without hunting instability 
has always been of interest to vehicle 
designers. 
The hunting phenomenon, which is a coupled 
oscillation of the wheelset in the lateral 
displacement and the yaw angle, often occurs 
when railway vehicles run at high speeds. The 
studies on the hunting stability of a bogie 
moving on tangent tracks can be found in a 
number of investigations (Wickens 1996; 
Dukkipati et al., 1998; Haque, and Lieh 1993; 
Narayana et al., 1994; Dukkipati et al., 2001; 
Mehdi, and Shaopu 1998; Lee and Cheng 
2003; Lee and Cheng 2005). In the early 
investigations on the hunting stability of a 
bogie, the bogie system was usually modeled 
by a six degrees of freedom system, including 
the lateral displacement and the yaw angle of 
the each wheelset and the bogie frame 
(Wickens 1996; Dukkipati et al., 1998; Haque, 
and Lieh 1993; Narayana et al., 1994; 
Dukkipati et al., 2001; Mehdi, and Shaopu 
1998; Lee and Cheng 2003). The boundaries 
between the bogie frame and the car body 
were assumed to be fixed in the bogie model 
(Wickens 1996; Dukkipati et al., 1998; Haque, 
and Lieh 1993; Narayana et al., 1994; 
Dukkipati et al., 2001; Mehdi, and Shaopu 
1998; Lee and Cheng 2003; Lee and Cheng 
2005). The hunting stability of a car modeled 
moving on the tangent tracks by a multiple 
degrees of freedom system was investigated 
by Hadden and Law (1997), Lei and Mao 
(2004), Lei and Noda (2002), Bruni et al. 
(1999), Valtorta et al. (2001), Diomin (1994), 
Diana et al. (1994), Zboinski (1999), Zeng 
and Wu (2004). 
The influence of the nondimensionaless 
suspension stiffness of the vehicle moving on 
the tangent tracks on the critical speed 
evaluated by the linear creep model was 
studied by Hadden and Law (1997). Utilizing 
the conventional Hertz formula, Lei and Mao 
(2004) and Lei and Noda (2002) illustrated the 
dynamic response of the vehicle in the time 
domain and the frequency domain. Bruni et al. 
(1999) studied the dynamic response of the 
vehicle for the multi-hertzian method. They 
investigated the hunting motion of the vehicle 
without yaw damping. The dynamic response 
of the half vehicle with linear creep model 
was presented by Valtorta et al. (2001). 
Besides, Diomin (1994) and Diana et al. 
parameters, such as LxijF , LyijF , RxijF , RyijF , 
syijF , tijF , wxI , wyI , wzI , LzijM , RzijM , szijM , 
wm , LyijN , RyijN , 0r , LxijR , LyijR , RxijR  and 
RyijR  are all defined in the nomenclature. In 
equation (5), the flange contact forces tijF  are 
considered.

the fourteen governing differential equations

Equations (18-21) are the governing 
differential equations of the motion of a truck 
modeled by a 6 DOF system. It is noted that 
these equations are identical to those given 
previously by Mehdi and Shaopu (1998). 
 
3. Stability Analysis 
  This paper utilizes the Lyapunov indirect 
method (Vidyasager, 1987) to study the 
influence of the physical parameters on the 
critical hunting speed of a bogie. The 
equations of motion of this autonomous 
system, i.e. equations (1) – (4) and (18) – (19), 
can be re-expressed as a system of first-order 
differential equations, i.e. 
[ ](t) (t)=x f x , (23) 
where ( )x t  is a 28 1× vector of state variables. 
For any given velocity V, a determinant 
Matrix A is defined as: 
0x
( )
=
∂ =  ∂ x
f xA
x
, (24) 
where 0x  is the equilibrium point and 
satisfies [ ]0 =f 0x .  
This dynamic system will be unstable if any 
one of the eigenvalues of Matrix A has a 
positive real part. The lowest velocity for 
which the eigenvalues of the associated 
determinant matrix A has a non-positive real 
part corresponds to the critical hunting speed. 
 
4. Numerical Results 
To verify the reliability of the current 
numerical analysis, the critical hunting speed 
of a bogie modeled by a 6 DOF system 
moving on a tangent track is compared with 
that calculated by Mehdi and Shaopu (1998). 
Utilizing the Lyapunov indirect method, the 
critical speed is calculated based on the same 
parametrical values used by Mehdi and 
Shaopu (1998). The critical hunting speed 
obtained in the present analysis is found to be 
118 km/h, which corresponds exactly to the 
value determined by Mehdi and Shaopu 
(1998). 
Using the system data parameters listed in 
Appendix (Ahmed and Sankar 1987; Hirotsu 
et al., 1991), the influences of these physical 
parameters on the critical hunting speed are 
investigated for a freight car. The maximum 
critical hunting speed of this half car system is 
found to be 386 km/h. 
Figures 4-9 compare the influences of various 
physical parameters on the critical hunting 
speeds for the 6 DOF and 14 DOF systems. 
The critical hunting speeds of the 6-DOF 
model, which the weight of the car body is 
lumped appropriately into the bogie frame and 
the axle load, are found. Figure 4 reveals that 
the critical hunting speed initially increases to 
a maximum value as the longitudinal stiffness 
of the primary suspension, Kpx, is increased, 
and then decreases as Kpx is further increased.
