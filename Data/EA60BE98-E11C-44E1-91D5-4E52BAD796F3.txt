The Affective Feelings of Texture – Timbers for Example 
  
 
Abstract: The present study aims to explore the relationship between texture and 
affective feelings. In this study, the frequently used timbers were used as example. Thirty 
participants took part in the experiment to provide their affective judgments of 14 timber 
textures on 13 affective scales. The results showed that three affective factors were 
identified. They were “comfort”, “pattern” and “attitude” factors. The timber textures 
used in the experiment were classified into four groups according to their affective 
feelings delivered. The results can be used to assist designers selecting the appropriate 
texture to fit their design objective.

1. Introduction 
Texture is one of the important design elements in the appearance of product. For fashion industry, texture 
related studies1-3 are often seen. However, for industrial design, there is short of studies to discuss the 
affective feelings of texture appeared on products or interior design. Some texture related studies4-6 used 
various types of materials trying to find out the general phenomenon of affective feelings. But for design, 
selecting texture from specific material is more practical in comparison with selecting from various types of 
materials. How to select appropriate texture to fulfill the affective feelings is a critical issue for designers. 
Hence, this study used 13 affective scales to investigate the affective feelings of timber textures. The aim is to 
find out the relationship between timber textures and affective feelings.  
 
2. Experimental Plan 
A psychophysical experiment was carried out. Thirty participants (15 males and 15 females) took part in this 
experiment, each participant was asked to assess the 14 timber textures on 13 affective scales. The 14 textures 
were selected from the frequently used timber textures in the field of interior design, as shown in Figure 1.

4. Results 
To see the relationship between 14 affective scales, the visual results were analyzed by the principle 
component analysis. The results showed that three affective factors were identified to describe the affective 
feelings of timber textures, as given in Table 1.  
 
Table 1: The results of principle component analysis. The three factors account for 78.5% of the total variance. 
Factor name Comfort Pattern Attitude
% of variance 58.7% 10.7% 9.1% 
Vulgar-Elegant 0.95 0.03 -0.17 
Rough-Smooth 0.93 0.27 -0.13 
Sad-Happy 0.91 0.36 0.03 
Dislike-Like 0.87 0.07 -0.39 
Light-Heavy -0.85 -0.29 0.30 
Simple-Complex -0.83 0.14 0.52 
Hard-Soft 0.81 0.53 0.04 
Cool-Warm 0.61 0.59 0.09 
Regular-Casual 0.09 0.93 0.18 
Organic-Geometric -0.22 -0.74 0.40 
Passive-Active 0.04 0.45 0.81 
Economical-Luxurious -0.61 -0.03 0.78 
Cheap-Expensive -0.18 -0.35 0.67 
 
 
The findings are described in the following. Note that the factor name could be arbitrary. 
1. The first factor accounted for 58.7% of total variance. This factor was closely related to the affective 
scales of “vulgar-elegant”, “rough-smooth”, “sad-happy”, “dislike-like”, “hard-soft”, “light-heavy”, 
“simple-complex” and “cool-warm”. All these related affective scales pointed to “comfort” feeling. The 
“comfort” feeling can be described by “vulgar” and “elegant” on the two ends of factor, because it was the 
highest related scale.  
2. The second factor, accounting for 10.7% of the total variance, was associated with “regular-casual” and 
“organic-geometric”. It is clear to correlate to texture pattern, named “pattern”. It can be described by 
“regular” and “casual” on the two ends of factor. . 
3. The third factor, accounting for 9.1% of the total variance, consisted of “passive-active”, 
“economical-luxurious” and “cheap-expensive”. These three scales were related to “attitude”. This factor 
was described by “passive” and “active” on the two ends.  
 
Furthermore, to understand the relationship between the affective factors and the textures, the most 
straightforward way is to see how these textures distribute in the affective feelings space, constructed by the 
three affective factors. The factor scores for each texture were used as coordinates to locate the textures in the 
affective space. Meanwhile the cluster analysis was carried out. The results showed that the textures can be 
categorized into four groups, as shown in Figure 3. The affective feelings for each group were summarized 
below:

The results are summarized below: 
1. The timber textures having lightness lower than 55 and hue angle located at 37∘to 56∘ with total-width 
between 109 and 174 were classified into Group 1, which cultivated the “regular”, “vulgar” and “active” 
feelings. This implied that the darker and reddish rough timber textures delivered “regular”, “vulgar” and 
“active” feelings. 
2. The timber textures in Group 3 had lightness between 55 and 65 and hue angle located at 60∘ to 
71∘with total-width between 118 and 151. Such timber texture delivered “passive”, “vulgar” and “casual” 
feelings. This indicated that the timber texture having brownish color and medium lightness with rough 
texture tended to have “passive”, “vulgar” and “casual” feelings. 
3. The timber textures having lightness higher than 72 and hue angle bigger than 66∘ with total-width up to 
100 were classified into Group 4, which tended “elegant” feeling. In other words, the “elegant” timbers 
had lighter yellowish color with fine texture.   
 
5. Conclusion 
The current paper aims to understand the affective feelings of timber textures. Thirty observers took part in 
the experiment to judge 14 timber texture on 13 affective scales. The results showed that three factors were 
sufficient to describe the affective feelings of timber texture. They were “comfort”, “pattern” and “attitude” 
factors. The timber textures were placed and grouped in the affective space, constructed by three affective 
factors. The common attributes of texture in each group were found out. The relationships between physical 
attributes and affective feelings were successful built. The designer can use the current paper as reference for 
timber texture selection.  
In the current paper, D65 simulator was used during experiment, however, in our daily life the light sources 
quite differ from D65 simulator, especially tungsten light is often used in family room. Additionally, the size 
of timber texture is another interesting issue. If the timber texture is applied onto a large area, unlike 10 cm × 
10 cm area, will affective feelings be affected? If the future research can involve more timber texture and 
provide evidence of size issue, it would be useful for designers for selecting timber texture. 
Also, It may be worth pointing out that the tactile sense play another important role in the affective feelings of 
textures. If the future studies can conduct experiment for tactile sense, it would complete the affective studies 
of textures.
