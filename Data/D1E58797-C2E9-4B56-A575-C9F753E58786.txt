BBa_R0040) are a family of constitutive promoter which can constitutively transcript 
the downstream gene. Ribosomal binding sites, (RBSs, BioBrick ref BBa_B0030, 
BBa_B0032, and BBa_B0034) are downstream from promoter, which can regulate 
the quantity of a protein translation level. As the signal output of GFP expression 
devices, GFP (GFP, BioBrick ref BBa_E0040) is derived from jellyfish Aequeora 
victoria wild-type GFP. The relation between protein concentration and fluorescence 
strength was regard as positive correlation. Terminator ( BioBrick ref BBa_J61048) is 
a T1 terminator from rnpB gene of E. coli MG1655 which is responsible for stopping 
transcription step. The biobricks used in this study were listed in Table 1. 
In the part of verification and application, we design nine repressor-controlled 
genetic circuits to verify the predictable behavior (Fig. 1b). In this circuit, TetR is 
expressed constitutively from upstream promoter-RBS biobrick. aTc, which freely 
diffuses into the cell, binds TetR and prevents the repression of downstream Ptet 
-RBS biobrick. In the upstream promoter-RBS biobrick, we pick three constitutive 
promoter, (BioBrick ref BBa_J23105, BBa_J23106, BBa_J23114) combining with 
RBS, (BioBrick ref BBa_B0034) for controlling TetR expression levels. TetR 
repressor protein (BioBrick ref BBa_C0040) coding gene is modified with an LVA tail 
for rapid protein degradation. In the downstream promoter-RBS biobrick, we select 
repressible promoter Ptet, which is constitutively ON and repressed by TetR repressor 
protein. We combine this promoter with three different RBSs, (BioBrick ref 
BBa_B0030, BBa_B0032, and BBa_B0034) to form three promoter-RBS devices 
with different protein expression ability. A genetic devices or circuit needs to be 
inserted into a carried backbone to express protein. The backbones contain a 
replication origin for determining the copies number in a host cell.  
In the step of collecting GFP expression level, we transfer the well prepared 
genetic circuit into low copy number backbone pSB3T5 or pSB3K3. The pSB3T5 
Backbone is a low copy number vector carrying tetracycline resistance and p15A 
replication origin (10–12copies per cell) is utilized in GFP expression devices. 
Backbone, pSB3K3 which is a low copy number vector carrying kanamycin 
resistance and p15A pMR101-derived replication origin (20–30copies per cell) is 
utilized in repressor-controlled genetic circuits. 
 
2.2 Data Analysis, Computational Models, and Simulations 
Fluorescence from an individual sample was calculated using CyFlow software 
(Partec.). The original log-binned ﬂuorescence intensity values were collected with 
cell number counting, then, the normal distribution fluorescence intensity graphics 
could be ranged for obtaining mean and standard deviation of the resulting values. 
The mean and standard deviation of the resulting values were obtained for each 
 4 
 
fluorescence intensity than combined with RBS (B0034) (Fig. 3d). The results 
indicated that the strength of RBS is not explicitly dependent on the sequence of RBS, 
the promoter sequence also affects the strength of RBS. The reusing of the same-well 
characterized RBS sequence for different promoter is not likely to work reliably. To 
address this problem, protein expression rate of combined promoter-RBS devices 
were characterized to replace the transcription rate of promoter and translation rate of 
RBS separately in this study. 
 
3.2 Build a Mathematical Model to Characterize Protein Expression Ability of 
Promoter-RBS Devices. 
The logistic growth model is commonly used to describe the bacterium growth 
curve under the nutrient limited condition as follow [24-25]:

(1) 
where s  denotes the cell density parameter (optical density at 600 nm (O.D. 600)), 
maxs  denotes the maximum value of cell density, and s
k  denotes growth rate 
constant. The cell density time course data of the bacteria with different GFP 
expression devices were used to solve Eq. (1) (Fig. 4). The growth rate constant sk  
was calculated and listed in Table 3. The Ptet promoter (R0040) combined with RBS 
(B0034) had higher GFP protein expression level and had the smaller sk  i.e., slower 
growth rate. The results indicated that protein expression level of a genetic circuit is 
negatively correlated to the growth rate of a host bacterium. Bacteria with a low 
metabolic load have greater growth rate.  
The protein expression ability of promoter-RBS devices is indirectly measured 
by fluorescence intensity of GFP expression devices (Fig. 2 and 3). Since the protein 
concentration per cell is diluted due to the cell growth and protein degradation, a 
dynamic model to character the protein expression ability of promoter-RBS devices 
can be built as follows:  
    GFPx p s g s x                                          (2) 
Where x  denotes the protein expression level of a GFP expression device (Fig. 1a). 
 p s  denotes the protein expression ability of a promoter-RBS device, which is the 
function of cell density parameter s  (optical density at 600 nm (O.D. 600)), and 
 6 
 
In order to determinate the working concentration of inducer aTc, we tested 8 
different concentrations, i.e. 0, 50, 100, 150, 250, 500, 1000, 2000 (ng/ml). For 
ensuring the cells grow to the steady-state, bacteria were cultured for 7 hours 
incubation with aTc. Then, we performed the data collection to achieve the defining of 
dose-dependent (Fig. 10) and cell density data (Fig. 11). We pick 1000 (ng/ml) as our 
working concentration for the purpose of inducing our repressible system [26]. 
Besides, we find that cells growth rate becomes slowing down in the higher inducer 
aTc concentration (Fig. 11). When the inducer concentration rises up to 10 times 
comparing to our working concentration, a phenomenon is observed that cell growth 
is inhibited (data not showed). 
Furthermore, our circuits should be constructed in low copy number backbone 
pSB3K3 instead of pSB3T5 to carry out desirable behavior. Our repressible circuits 
can be turn on only in the inducer aTc existing condition. As information showed, 
inducer aTc is the analogue of antibiotic tetracycline. If we pick pSB3T5 as the 
backbone of circuits, the selection antibiotic tetracycline partially block the function 
of repressor. Then, the behavior of our repressible circuits may act not as our 
prediction. In order to integrate the parameters of GFP expression devices into our 
repressible circuits, we need to clarify one matter that the affect between the two 
different backbones. The backbone with 10–12copies per cell is called as pSB3T5 
which used in GFP expression devices. And the backbone with 20–30copies per cell is 
called as pSB3K3 which used in repressible circuits for the aim of application and 
verification. The difference between backbones pSB3T5 and pSB3K3 are indicated 
that copy number can directly cause the protein expression quantity ratio changing as 
showing in (Fig. 12). This effect should be considered as a constant in the model 
prediction process. 
 
3.3.2  Mathematical model description 
    In this section, the parameters we use which are from Table 4 and Table 5 and all 
of fluorescence measurement data of these repressible circuits do not participate 
modeling identified process. The dynamic model in Eq. (5), expressed from a 
constitutive promoter and model in Eq. (6), expressed from a repressible promoter 
which is regulated by an inducer aTc, is shown as follows:

3.3.3 Prediction result 
The expression parameters in the library of promoter-RBS devices in Table 4 and 
Table 5 can determine the corresponding devices regulatory activity. The different 
selections of devices specify different regulation functions in Eq. (1) and the synthetic 
regulatory network have the different behaviors by these devices. Base on the 
combinational devices which are selected from Table 2 to become a new circuit with 
repressible behavior in Table 7. The predictable results are showed in (Fig. 15). The 
simulated curve can predict the real experimental trend. Hence, the selection of 
adequate device from library can be considered as a design method for the synthetic 
gene network to achieve some desired behaviors. The devices in the synthetic 
regulatory network could be considered as a device set, and then the device set in the 
regulatory network can regulate gene expression to desired behaviors. 
4 Discussion 
Recently, a controllable life system is concerned. In a life system, protein-protein 
interaction directly affected whole system behaviors, and all of these functional 
proteins were decided by the genetic codon. Therefore, synthetic scientists can utilize 
molecular biology techniques to manipulate and modify DNA sequences for a specific 
application. In the last years many gene circuits have been developed to achieve a fine 
tune of gene expression and protein synthesis. All of these literatures displayed the 
same ideal that protein expression level can be tuned and predicted [27-31]. 
Predictable function is performed by mathematic model calculating, that is the major 
feature in synthetic biology. Each case showed that simulation result can match with 
experiment data. As description, it exhibited a very useful application by using 
mathematic model to predict system behaviors. Unfortunately, some problems had 
been existed for a period of time. The simulation of each case needed to develop a 
new model system by iterative model calculation. Even in the similar events, synthetic 
scientists also required to create a new model for fitting their own experiment data. 
For the reason, it will waste a large amount and time and money to iteratively 
calculate the mathematical model. In order to solve this problem, we proposed three 
strategies as our results. Before we studied a complex life behavior, several simple 
components were analyzed for estimating the parameters of our model by the 
identification technique. Then, our model could generally apply to another gene 
expression system by using our promoter-RBS library. Furthermore, we proposed a 
new concept totally subverting existing opinion. Previous researches told us how to 
define the promoter and RBS strengths. However, only the steady states of system 
were considered. Since the gene expression is a dynamic behavior, the time profile 
plays an important role in estimating promoter-RBS strength constant. On the other 
 10 
 
proportionally double.   
    In this study, to design a novel gene network and functional circuit with 
predictable function were our final goal. Based on this reason, we designed 
repressible circuits for verifying our hypothesis. In these repressible circuits, we 
randomly picked up promoter-RBS devices to demonstrate the predictable functional 
(Fig.15). In result (Fig. 15), the simulation curves were not matching as our expected. 
The main reason was that a synthetic gene network suffers from both (1) intrinsic 
parameter fluctuations due to gene expression noises, alternative splicing, DNA 
mutation, thermal fluctuations, and (2) external disturbances due to undefined or 
changing extra cellular environment, interactions with cellular context in the host cell. 
These intrinsic parameter fluctuations and external disturbances currently hindered us 
from performing the interactional networks of specific gene and protein. 
Finally, if the transcription and translation processes were not considered during 
the engineering of the synthetic gene networks, the realized networks cannot show the 
predictable or desired behaviors. Hence the distribution of this paper is not only to 
improve the existing gene networks, but also to engineer a novel gene networks by the 
mathematical model developed in this paper. In the future, more and more biological 
compositions are identified and well-characterized, engineering a novel and 
predictable gene network will be easily implemented. This will be a great distribution 
for synthetic biology.

green fluorescence protein (GFP) and transcriptional terminators. (b) In this circuit, TetR is expressed

detected every 15 minutes. And all of the data represented the average of three independent 
measurements. Error bars indicated standard deviations. X-axis indicated the time units, and Y-axis 
indicated the fluorescence units with different scales. Furthermore, the fluorescent signals changed with 
time per cell were measured by using a flow cytometer.

Figure 9: The schematic diagram for measuring the promoter-RBS activities 
included 9 sets of combinatorial promoter-RBS devices.  
We designed a repressor-controlled system for verifying our predicted model. It can be divided into two 
parts. In the part of upstream was responsible for yielding repressor to repress target promoter. In the 
part of upstream, promoter-RBS devices controlled the TetR protein producing. In the part of 
downstream, promoter-RBS devices controlled the yielding of reporter gene, green fluorescence 
protein. And the expression of reporter gene will be turned on when inducer was adding to block the 
repressor. Thus, each promoter-RBS devices were expected to play a major role for showing expression 
diversity. As diagram showing, upstream contained 3 sets of promoter-RBS devices and each set had 
the same ribosome binding site (B0034). Downstream contained 3sets of promoter-RBS devices and 
each set has the same repressible promoter (R0040).

signal is also measured (Fig.5). As result (a)(b)(c) demonstration, when inducer aTc concentration 
raised up to 2000 ng/ml, cell density had a significant decreased current. Result (c) had a higher 
variation in the low inducer concentration region and high inducer concentration.
