ABSTRACT 
The innovative Al/APC-2 hybrid nanocomposite laminates were manufactured. First to overcome the 
usual problem of delamination the Al 2024 thin plates were treated by an anodic method of electro-plating 
to achieve perfectly bonding with matrix PEEK, in addition to previously used method of surface 
treatment by CrO3 enchant. The prepregs of Carbon/PEEK unidirectional plies were cut and stacked into 
cross-ply [0/90]2 laminates. The nanoparticles of SiO2 were uniformly spread on the interfaces of 
laminate with an optimal amount of 1 wt% based on previous findings. The hybrid nanocomposite 
laminates were fabricated in a hot press according to the modified diaphragm curing process. Then, the 
high performance hybrid nanocomposite laminates of Al sheets sandwiched by APC-2 cross-ply laminates 
were adopted for tensile tests at elevated temperature. 
From the tensile tests, it was obvious to find that the data of mechanical properties for the surface 
treatment of Al sheets by electro-plating were better than those by chemical etching. Then, the surface 
treatment by the anodic method was adopted to fabricate the hybrid laminates for cyclic tests at elevated 
temperature. 
An MTS servohydraulic computer-controlled dynamic material testing machine with environmental 
chamber was used to perform the constant stress amplitude cyclic tests with stress ratio=0.1 and 
frequency=5Hz. The received fatigue data were plotted in S-N curves at variously elevated temperature. 
The positions of S-N curves go downwards as temperature rising. It was a surprise that no delamination 
was found in tensile tests as well as in cyclic tests at elevated temperature. The success of nearly perfect 
bonding was highlighted in our manufacturing processes. In addition, if the applied stress normalized by 
the ultimate stress at the corresponding temperature, the normalized S-N curves are close with some curve 
positions reversed. That strongly shows a significant improvement of mechanical properties is achieved, 
even at elevated temperature.

1. Introduction 
Composite materials have been applied 
widely, such as civil, defense and aerospace 
industries, due to their low specific density, high 
specific strength, stiffness, easy manufacturing, 
high resistance to fatigue loading and sustaining 
most mechanical properties at elevated 
temperature. However, “lighter, thinner, stronger 
and cheaper” are the goal of materials science and 
engineering nowadays. With the advent of nano 
science and technology many developed and 
powerful countries have made effort vigorously in 
related R&D recently. Engineering materials at the 
atomic and molecular levels are creating a 
revolution in the field of materials and processing. 
The discovery of new nanoscaled materials such 
as nanoclays, carbon nanotubes, and others offer 
the promise of a variety of new composite, 
adhesive, coating and sealant materials with 
specific properties. Thus, we intend to make 
nanocomposites by using the peculiar physical, 
chemical and mechanical characteristics of 
nanoparticles based on the long-term experience 
in making and testing composite laminates. The

thickness of a alloy sheet is 0.5 mm after rolled, 
heated and weight flattened with scratch brushing. 
The density of Al 2024 is 2.78g/cm3 , melting 
point temperature is 502-638°C, ultimate tensile 
strength is 469MPa, and modulus of elasticity is 
73.1GPa. 
Prior to lamination, the slimmed 2024 sheets 
were subjected to pretreatment by electro-plating 
in order to create the rough surface for better 
bonding with the APC-2 prepregs. The first trial 
was to mechanically polish the sheet surface by 
using #200 SiC abrasive papers. Instead of 
chemical etching by CrO3-base etchant, 
electroplating was found better demonstrated by 
the results of mechanical tests. 
The APC-2 cross-ply prepregs were 
sandwiched with the Al 2024 sheets to produce 
Al/CF/PEEK laminated composites, expressed as 
Al/APC-2/Al/APC-2/ Al. The modified diaphragm 
curing process as shown in Figure1 was adopted. 
The nano-particles SiO2 were uniformly spread on 
the interfaces with the optimal amount 1 wt%. The 
geometry and dimensions of a hybrid composite 
specimen were shown in Figure 2. 
An MTS-810 servohydraulic computer- 
controlled dynamic material testing machine was 
used to conduct the tensile test and constant stress 
amplitude T-T cyclic test with stress ratio = 0.1, 
frequency = 5Hz, sinusoidal wave form under 
load-controlled mode at elevated temperatures, 
such as 25°C (RT), 75, 100, 125, 150°C (slightly 
above APC-2 PEEK Tg = 143°C). An MTS 651 
environmental chamber was also installed to keep 
and control the specific temperature of a specimen 
inside for cyclic testing. A 25.4-mm MTS- 
634.11F -25 extensometer was used to monitor the 
strain continuously during the tests. 
3. Results 
The  hybrid  composite  laminates  were  
fabricated successfully.  The  mechanical 
properties of Al/APC-2 hybrid five-layered 
nanocomposite laminates were listed in Tables 1-2. 
Generally, the ultimate strength decreases with the 
temperature increasing. However, the longitudinal 
stiffness does not follow the trend. Mostly, it even 
becomes higher as the temperature rising. As 
shown in Fig. 3. The applied stress vs. cycles (S-N) 
curves of hybrid nanocomposite cross-ply 
laminates at elevated temperature were presented 
in Fig. 4. Needless to say all the applied stresses 
normalized by the ultimate stress at RT, the P-N 
curves are in the same trend. However, the 
normalized S-N curves by their own ultimate 
stress at the corresponding temperature of hybrid 
nanocomposite laminates as described in Fig. 5, it 
is found that the normalized P-N curves are 
reverse in sequence from top to bottom as the 
rising of temperature and also closely together less 
than 1000 cycles.  
4. Discussion 
In specimens the strength of cross-ply 
generally decreases as the rising of temperature, 
except a jump of strength in cross-ply laminates at 
75°C due to the precipitation of Al sheets. 
However, their stiffnesses even increase at high 
temperature. That is an evidence of sustaining 
stiffness of PEEK matrix at temperature below Tg. 
However, the longitudinal stiffness of both lay-ups 
decreases slightly, and it is irregular at elevated 
temperature. 
It is reasonable to expect the S-N curves go 
downwards as the temperature rising as shown in 
Fig. 4, and the similar trend happens when 
normalized by the ultimate stress at RT. However, 
the S-N curves become reverse in positions as 
shown in Fig. 5, if normalized by the respective 
ultimate stress at the corresponding temperature. 
That obviously tells us the fatigue resistance of 
hybrid nano-composite laminates does not 
seriously degrade even at elevated temperature. 
Thus, APC-2 and Al/APC-2 composite laminates 
are found one of the best candidate composite 
laminates applied in aerospace and defense 
industries. 
Due to the proper surface treatments the 
bonding between Al sheet and APC-2 prepregs is 
good enough that no delaminations were found in 
these samples during fabrication and in tests. In 
this work electro-plating was adopted instead of 
previously used chemical etching by CrO3 etchant. 
Prior to the adoption basic tests were performed to 
assure the better bonding as demonstrated in the 
test results. 
5. Conclusion  
The hybrid Al/APC-2 nano-composite 
laminates were successfully fabricated. The tensile 
and cyclic tests were performed at elevated 
temperature. The concluding remarks are
