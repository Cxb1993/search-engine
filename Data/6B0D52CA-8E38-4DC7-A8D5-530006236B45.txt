2 
capability index pmC , has been sometimes called 
the Taguchi index. The index emphasizes on 
measuring the ability of  the process to cluster 
around the target, which therefore reflects the 
degrees of  process targeting (centering). The index 
pmC  incorporates with the variation of  production 
items with respect to the target value and the 
specification limits preset in the factory. The index 
pmC  is defined as: 
( )2 2 226 ( ) 3pm
USL LSL dC
T Tσ µ σ µ
−= =+ − + −
, (1) 
where ( ) / 2d USL LSL= −  refers to the half  
length of  the allowable tolerance of  the process. The 
term ( )2 2 2( )E X T Tσ µ− = + −  incorporates 
two variation components: [i] variation to the 
process mean and [ii] deviation of  the process mean 
from the target. By observing the definition of  pmC , 
it is easy to see that if  the process variance increases 
(decreases) then the denominator will increase 
(decrease) and pmC  will decrease (increase). Also, 
if  the process’s mean moves away from (closer to) 
the target value, then the denominator will increase 
(decrease) and pmC  will decrease (increase). 
Obviously, pmC  is sensitive to T  with an 
additional penalty for being off-target. Furthermore, 
Ruczinski (1996) obtained a lower bound on the 
process yield as 2 (3 ) 1pmYield C≥ Φ − , or 
equivalently % 2 ( 3 )pmNC C≤ Φ −  for 
3 / 3pmC > .  
 However, in practice, the knowledge of  the 
process mean µ  and the process variance 2σ  are 
required for assessing the index value pmC  for a 
given process. Thus, sample data are collected to 
calculate the value of  the estimated index, and a 
great degree of  uncertainty (sampling errors) is 
introduced into capability analysis. Under normal 
conditions, statistical properties of  the estimator of  
pmC  have been investigated extensively, including 
Chan et al. (1988), Kushler and Hurley (1992), 
Pearn et al. (1992, 1998), Kotz and Lovelace (1998), 
Borges and Ho (2001), Hoffman (2001), Zimmer et 
al. (2001), Chen, et al. (2005), Daniels, et al. (2005), 
and Bordignon and Scagliarini (2006). Kotz and 
Johnson (2002) provide a compact survey with 
interpretations and comments of  some 170 
publications on process capability indices during 
1992-2000. In this paper, various traditional 
frequentist and Bayesian approaches are reviewed 
and compared based on the accuracy in estimating 
the capability index pmC . Throughout this paper, it 
is assumed that the process measurements are 
independent, identically distributed as the normal 
distribution and the process is under statistical 
control.  
 
2. Sampling Distributions of  the Estimated pmC  
The definition of  pmC  involves two unknown 
parameters µ  and 2σ , which must be estimated 
from sample. Chan et al. (1988) and Boyles (1991) 
proposed the following two estimators of  pmC , 
pmC  and ˆ pmC , respectively, 
 
( ) ( ) ( )22 2 11 33 1
pm n n
i ni
d dC
S X TX T n −=
= =
+ −− −∑
 (2) 
ˆ
pmC ( ) ( )22 21 33 n nii
d d
S X TX T n=
= =
+ −−∑ , (3) 
where 1 /ni iX X n== Σ , 
2 2
1( ) /( 1)ni iS X X n== Σ − −  and 
2 2
1( ) /nn i iS X X n== Σ − .  
The two estimators, pmC  and ˆ pmC , are 
essentially the same. An alternative formula was 
provided in Pearn et al. (1992). Note that X  and 
2
nS  are the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) 
of  µ  and 2σ , respectively. Hence, the estimated 
ˆ
pmC  is also the MLE of  pmC . Boyles (1991) 
considered that it would be more appropriate to 
replace the factor 1n −  by n  in the denominator 
since the term 2 2( )nS X T+ − = 21( ) /ni iX T n=Σ −  
and ( )22[ ]nE S X T+ − = 2 2( )Tσ µ+ −  in the 
denominator of  ˆ pmC  is the uniformly minimum 
variance unbiased estimator (UMVUE) of  the term 
2 2( )Tσ µ+ − . Therefore, it is reasonable, for 
reliability purpose, that we use the estimator ˆ pmC  
to evaluate process performance. However, the point 
estimate is a random variable which provides no 
confidence on the estimation accuracy. It would be 
more useful to construct lower confidence bounds, 
which guarantee the minimal capability at some 
designated level of  confidence. Kotz and Johnson 
(1993) derived formulas for the rth  moment of  
ˆ
pmC . Note that the quantity ( )22 2nn S X T σ⎡ ⎤+ −⎣ ⎦  has a non-central 
chi-square 2,n λχ  distribution with n  degrees of  
freedom and non-centrality parameter 2nλ ξ=  
where ( )Tξ µ σ= − . Boyles (1991) and Pearn et 
al. (1992) showed that ˆ pmC  is distributed as 
2
,p nC n λχ , which can be equivalently expressed 
as: 
 2

ˆ ~ 1pm pm

In fact, (3) can be alternatively expressed 
as ( )ˆ 3pmC D K Y= + , where D nd σ= , 
2 2 2
1~n nK nS σ χ −= , ( )2 2Y n X T σ= − . Thus, 
the probability density function (PDF) and 
cumulative distribution function (CDF) of  ˆ pmC  
can be obtained as (Chen et al. (1999)), 
ˆ ( )
