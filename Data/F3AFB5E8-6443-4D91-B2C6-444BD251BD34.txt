壹、背景、動機及目的  
近年來眾多研究單位以及產業界人士相當看好這類微小裝置的未來前景以及其所能夠
發展之應用，其中當屬微型無線感測器網路(Wireless Sensor Network , WSNs)最受大家注目。 
無線感測器網路之環境如圖 1所示，其是由許許多多個功能不盡相同的無線感測器節點
(Wireless sensor node)以及一個或一個以上的基地台(Base station)或資料收集節點
(Sink)所建構而成，再將無線感測器所監測的資料透過各種傳輸方式，將資料回傳至基地台
或資料收集中心，以便進行資料處理。

圖1：無線感測器網路架構示意圖 
無線感測器網路是由一群通訊分散式的感測器節點所組成，而每一個感測器節點皆具有
運算、感測之功能，將感測器散佈在所需探測的環境中，利用自我組織(Self-Organized)的能
力架構出無線感測器網路，以利監測到的資料回傳。 
由於無線網路的發 展，延伸出各種形態的無線網路，而無線感測器網路就是研究的熱
門議題之一，早期主要應用於軍事戰場上敵軍的監控，接著逐漸貼近生活，例如自然保護區
的監測、建築物的監視、區域環境資料的蒐集等等[1][2][3]，幫助人類處理或監測一些不易
接近或危險的工作區域，進而達到災害預防的目的。然而現在微處理器的技術、無線通訊技
術、電力技術等迅速發展，使得這些感測節點具有感測、無線通訊以及基本運算的處理能力。
而這類型的感測節點能夠感應及偵測區域內的各項變化，並且將其所監測到或者接收到的資
料聚集在一起（Data aggregation）配合簡易的運算，最後再透過無線傳輸的方式將此資料回
傳至基地台或是資料收集節點。 
隨著科技的進步，Sensor nodes 具有體積小、成本低的特性，也因為擁有這一些特性，
也伴隨著不少的限制，例如感測器節點在能量(Energy)、運算能力(Computing ability)、儲存
容量(Storage capacity)等等皆有很大的限制，因此如何在無線感測網路的環境下，節省其電
量的消耗是一個很重要的議題，通常在這些感測器節點為了節省電力都是使用低功率、短距
離的傳輸方式，倘若基地台或是資料收集中心與感測節點之間的距離太遠時，感測器節點則
會透過多重節點路由協定(Multi-hop routing protocol)方式將資料回傳，或是加入行動資料收
集節點(Mobile Sink)，以達到資料收集的目的，無論是固定式或是具移動能力的，要如何透
過一個好的路由協定將所感測到的資料回傳至基地台是很重要的。 
而在無線感測器網路中，感測器節點的主要電量消耗為感測、通訊及運算三項，其中又
以通訊所耗費的電力為最大宗，並且其感測器節點之間進行通訊所需消耗的電量與其距離的
二或四次方成反比[4][5]，故傳輸距離是電力損耗的主要因素，為了避免感測器節點對於較
遠的資料收集節點進行直接通訊，而導致感測器電量大量消耗，因此大都是使用 Multi-hop 
routing [66]的方式傳輸(如圖 2)。 
  
由於本研究的方向為行動感測器網路的探討，並且著重於網路架構中配置具有移動能力
的資料收集節點，因此，在本章節中，我們將介紹無線感測器網路中，有關行動資料收集節
點的相關議題並加以敘述。 
A 行動資料收集節點移動方式 
行動資料收集節點的移動方式通常分成兩種，分別為固定軌跡式(Predefined Path)和隨機
路徑式(Random Waypoint)[15] Z. M. Wang, S. Basagni, E. Melachrinoudis, and C. 
Petrioli, “Exploiting sink mobility for maximizing sensor networks lifetime.＂,

mobile element scheduling in wireless sensor networks.＂ Proc. of SECON,

[]等移動方式。固定軌跡式通常使用各種空間填充曲線(Space-Filling Curve , SFC)[4]的
演算法，而在隨機移動的方式上的隱藏式馬可夫模型(Hidden Markov Model , HMM)[]。 
A.1 固定軌跡式(Predefined Path) 
空間填充曲線(Space-Filling Curve , SFC)為二維空間的一維編碼，其利用各種不同運算
將二維空間轉變為一維續列的編碼法，在二維的空間中分割網格並放置節點，利用空間填充
曲線的編碼之後，其將穿過網格中所有的節點，並且每一個節點剛好只經過一次。空間填充
曲線的種類繁多，如下圖 3所示，依其路徑走向的相似性可分為「遞迴式空間填充曲線」
(Recursive_SFC , RSFC)(圖 3-a,b,c)以及「非遞迴式空間填充曲線」(non-Recursive_SFC , 
NRSFC)(圖 3-d,e)[][]，以下我們將介紹常使用於行動資料收集節點移動演算法的 Hilbert 
SFC 演算法。 
Hilbert 填充曲線是連續且沒有交叉的一種二維空間填充曲線，且應用於各種領域，例
如：路線追蹤、圖像分析、結構分析、資料壓縮…等等，其屬於遞迴式的空間填充曲線。

參、研究方法及進行步驟 
無線感測器網路至今已有多年的研究，各方面的相關議題皆持續地研究中，路由協定就
是其中之一，亦有許多相關研究相繼被提出，這些研究中也各有其優缺點，而欲達成的研究
目標皆相同，如同前面所分析的，由於許多因素，以致於無線感測器的電量有限，因此，該
如何降低多餘電能的消耗，以及在整體無線感測器網路下，各個無線感測器的負載平衡，將
是本計劃所要探討的。 
故計劃中所提出一個應用於無線感測網路之網格叢集化行動路由協定(Mobile Sink 
Routing Protocol with Row-prime Order Clustering in Wireless Sensor Networks, ROCP)，當整個
無線感測器網路完成感測節點佈置後，隨即建構出虛擬的叢集，並依此叢集建置座標系統，
再透過行動資料收集節點（Mobile Sink）直接移動至各個無線感測節點以 one-hop 的方式收
集監測資料，且有效地減少無線感測節點在整個網路上協助代傳封包的頻率，進而降低電量
消耗以提高整體感測網路的存活時間。 
本研究是利用行動資料收集節點進行資料收集的工作，而行動路由的演算法包含移動的
方式，收集資料的型態及步驟，使用蜂巢架構進行網路節點的配置，並建立虛擬叢集架構，
接著以行動資料收集節點進行資料的收集。預計於計劃中演算法大致可分為以下三個不同的
部份來進行： 
1. 建構網路叢集架構階段(Clustering Phase , CP) 
2. 資料收集階段(Data Gathering Phase , DGP) 
A. 資料傳輸協定 (Data Transmission Protocol , DTP) 
B. 行動路由演算法(Moving Scheme Algorithm , MSA) 
3. 事件觸發部分(Event Trigger Part , ETP) 
當感測器佈置完成之後，行動資料收集節點將得知整體網路概況，便會執行 CP，將網
路進行叢集化，當完成叢集化之後，整體感測器網路將分成多個虛擬叢集，並且於行動資料
收集節點紀錄各個虛擬叢集所包含的感測器序號，以提供 MSA 使用。完成 CP 後，接著進
行 DGP，利用資料收集節點的移動，移動路徑則依循 MSA 經過各虛擬叢集的中心點，並在
移動途中收集感測器所監測到的資料；除此之外，我們也針對緊急事件發生時，提出有別於
傳統的應對方式；透過這樣的程式，能夠減少各個感測節點代傳的頻率，連帶減低了電量的
消耗，進而延長整體網路的存活時間。 
接下來我們將介紹無線感測網路的環境設定及各項假設，接著分別詳述上述三個部份：
建構網路叢集架構階段(CP)、資料收集階段(DGP)，之後事件觸發部分(ETP)，針對事件發生
時，資料傳輸的方式加以敘述。 
B.1 網路環境及假設 
我們利用蜂巢式架構的方式佈置感測器，佈置進入區域的感測器，是固定無法移動的節
點，一旦被放置之後，及固定在該地理位置上，無法再任意移動，並且各個感測節點無論是
  
行微調維護，而上述 Remainder power 可利用公式 2 求得： 
%100*

Max
IDSensor
res
IDSensor E
E=λ      (2) 
上述公式中 IDSensoe _λ 表示剩餘電量的百分比， IDSensorresE _ 代表該感測器所剩餘的電量，
MaxE 為感測器預設的最大電量。行動資料收集節點進行叢集劃分的流程，如圖 8 所示： 
首先，行動資料收集節點在感測器完成部署之後，可得知網路基本資訊，每一列所擁有
的感測器個數(Base)，得知此參數，利用公式 3 可得該無線感測器節點所屬列的序號(Line)，
將 Sensor_ID 與 Base 進行模運算(公式 4)，即可得叢集編號第一項參數，假設一個叢集至多
包含三個感測器，因此，透過公式 5 便能得到叢集編號中的第二項參數。 
BASEIDSensor _Linesensor_ID =                          (3) 
Base mod __ _ IDSensorxC IDSensor =     (4) 
3LineC_ySensor_ID =       (5) 
 
圖 8：網路叢集化流程圖 
最後，網路上所有的感測器中，其 IDSensorxC __ 以及 IDSensoryC __ 值相同者，同屬於一
個虛擬叢集(公式 6)，並記錄於叢集資訊表；另一方面，對於各個無線感測節點則會利用 Hello 
Message 廣播，與其 one hop 距離的感測節點交換本身的識別編號以及所屬的叢集編號。

舉例來說，當 Base =4 時(如圖 9)，根據公式 3 可計算出 Line 值，接著透過公式 4 及
公式 5 可知，C_x0=C_x4=C_x8=0 且 C_y0=C_y4=C_y0=0，故{0,4,8}屬於同一叢集，以此類推，
完成後即建立叢集資訊表(錯誤! 找不到參照來源。)。 
  
表4：感測資料(SD)封包格式表 
Event_priority Sensor_ID Eres Arrival_time(Ta) DATA 
第一個欄位 Event_priority 代表事件處理的優先權值，一般性感測資料則為初始值
(Default=0)，而 Eres在先前章節有提及，即為該感測器剩餘電量；由於本演算法中的行動資
料收集節點的移動路線為固定，所以 Arrival_time 欄位表示感測器預測行動資料收集節點到
達的時間，以供行動節點微調校對使用；最後則是感測資料的部份。 
行動節點移動至任意叢集的資料收集程序如下圖 10 所示，當其到達虛擬叢集的中心
時，利用群播的方式傳送 Hello message 通知叢集中的各個感測器，進入資料傳輸狀態(圖
10-a)；由於經過先前章節的程序，各個感測節點知道自己於同一叢集中的傳送順序，因此
將會依序將感測資料封包傳送至資料收集中心(圖 10-b)，而行動資料收集節點接收完其一感
測器所傳送的資料封包後，即回傳 ACK 封包(圖 10-c)，由於 ACK 封包包含接收端的識別編
號，而發送的同時相鄰的感測器可得知當前傳輸的序號，並接續進行資料傳輸；然而，當行
動資料收集節點接受到感測節點的感測資料封包後，隨即將叢集資訊表進行更新程序(圖
10-d)，完成叢集內所有感測節點的資料收集並將叢集資訊表更新後，行動資料收集節點則
透過 MSA 移動至下一個叢集，而行動資料收集節點的移動方式及路徑，我們將於下列章節
繼續說明。 
 
圖 10：資料傳輸示意圖 
B.3.2 行動路由演算法(Moving Scheme Algorithm , MSA) 
在此節我們將介紹行動資料收集節點的移動方式演算法，本研究是使用固定路徑、固定
速率的移動方式，行動資料收集節點依此路徑移動，移動至各叢集中進行監測資料的收集，
如此，不僅能夠預測收集節點到達的時間，另一方面由於利用依序式移動，因而達到各個感
測器負載平衡的目的。 
  
 
圖 12：偶數模式路由流程圖 
B.3.2.2 奇數模式 
由於整個網路的虛擬叢集為奇數列，因此與偶數模式的路由演算法有些微差異，當次要
方向的位移無法滿足，判斷是否能夠位移一半的距離，並根據 CIT 查詢是否所有叢集皆已
拜訪時，而奇數模式的環境將出現無法位移一半的距離( 233 sR )，且並非所有的叢集皆
拜訪的情形。 
於路由流程圖(圖 13)中，將其差異的程序標記為虛線區域，此時，行動資料收集節點將
會依當下的方向參數進行反向位移固定的距離，移動完成後，即將 D 參數中的次要方向設
定成-β，並使用重設後的 D 參數依據相同的演算法進行移動，直到查詢 CIT 得知所有的叢
集皆拜訪完成後，行動資料收集節點將直接移動回到原點的位置，而於中途並不會進行任何
訊息發送及接收。 
  
 
圖 14：事件觸發流程示意圖 
當事件觸發時，所屬的虛擬叢集則會執行事件觸發程序(ETP)，並且計算出該時間下，
行動資料收集節點的位置及移動方向(圖 14-a)，由於感測器擁有行動資料收集節點的資訊，
因此其將會複製事件訊息封包，並且將其往行動節點主要移動方向之正交向量方向進行傳送
(圖 14-b)，而行動資料收集節點並不需要另外更改其移動方向及移動路徑，仍 0 依據原有的
MSA 之方向、路徑進行移動(圖 14-c)，而當行動資料收集節點移動至該擁有事件訊息封包
之無線感測器時，不須額外的處理程序，可直接於資料收集的過程中接收到事件訊息(圖
14-d)。如此，在整體無線感測器網路上，任何的突發事件，皆可以在最短的時間內將事件
資料回傳，並且行動資料收集節點可依據其事件的優先程度回報至後端伺服器。 
肆、計畫的執行與討論 
於本計劃中我們提出了「網格叢集化行動路由協定」(Mobile Sink Routing Protocol with 
Row-prime Order Clustering in Wireless Sensor Networks,ROCP)，透過在無線感測網路環境裡
佈置一個行動資料收集節點，利用此節點的移動，收集各個感測器節點所監測資料的路由協
定，在此我們採用 SFC 中的 ROW、Hilbert 的固定軌跡技術及馬可夫模型為基礎的隨機路徑
作為參考，與計畫所提出之 ROCP 進行比較與分析。 
C.1 模擬比較及分析 
本計劃所提出之 ROCP 目的在於降低感測器進行資料代傳的頻率，以減少代傳所造成
之電量消耗，並利用依序方式移動配合 one-hop 的方式進行資料收集，以防止 hot zone 的產
生，進而達到網路負載平衡及延長網路存活時間。 
圖 15 中我們可以得知在網路環境中所有感測器節點電量均低於 10%時，所有節點之勝
於電量分布情形。當採用隨機移動方式時，在重複移動的路徑上由於產生了 hot zone 的問
題，因此該路徑之節點電量消耗的速度較快，反之，較少經過的路徑上之節點其剩餘電量較
多，此一情形會造成當網路停止運作時，節點將剩下大量的電量，因此可發現整體網路之剩
餘電量極為不平均；本計劃中所提出之 ROCP 演算法利用固定路徑依序移動，因此可達到
各節點之間的負載平衡，由圖 15 中亦可發現各節點之電量均可充分的利用，且其剩餘電量
之分布亦較為平均；在 Sweep 與 Hilbert 的方式中均使用固定路徑移動之方式，因此其剩餘
電量分布圖也較為類似計畫所提之演算法，但在根據實驗數據之計算下，若使用 Random 
waypoint 之方式，平均約有 38.7%的電量是被浪費掉的。 
  
 
圖 15：剩餘電量分布圖 
由於在無線感測器網路運作中，若感測器節點電量耗盡時，將無法持續於該節點所涵蓋
之感測範圍內進行監測工作，因此網路節點存活個數對於維持整體監測區域的完整性上為極
其重要之因素，在圖 16 中，我們針對節點存活個數的部份做分析與比較。於圖 16 中可得知，
ROCP 除了能夠保持網路整體完整性外，其持續運作之時間較其他演算法來的長，其主要原
因為計畫中所提出之演算法可均勻地分散使用各感測器節點之電量，以達到負載平衡的效
果；由於 Hilbert 屬於遞迴式之 SFC，其運算時的複雜度較高，需額外消耗些許電量進行計
算之工作，致使圖中其與所提之演算法有小幅度之差異；而當行動資料收集節點使用Random 
waypoint 方式移動時，則會產生 hot zone 的現象，因此其部份之節點電量較快耗盡。 
 
圖 16：感測節點生存個數與網路運作次數關係圖 
另外，由於感測器節點之容量有限，因此所能存放之監測資料也會受限，倘若感測器的
記憶體容量已達臨界值，其將無法繼續正常進行監測，需等待行動資料收集節點到此收集資
料後，才能再次進行監測工作，因此感測節點等待行動資料收集節點的時間也是重要的考量
之一。

2. Related Works 
 
The time series problems [9] are considered in this 
re-search, and, in this case, we will introduce some 
related data/web mining technologies widely used as the 
basis of our proposed mechanisms. 
Landmark [10] represents the beginning of system 
time. In this model, data will be processed from the time 
a system starts until present time. Due to the consistent 
speed of time, we can easily analyze and compare the 
process history in the time model. The disadvantage is 
that it will cause extreme workload to systems when 
over time processing occurs. Besides, not all of the data 
in such timescale are useful. We need to take garbage 
data processing into consideration when utilizing this 
Model. 
Sliding Window Model [11] gives solutions to the 
disadvantages to the Landmark Model. It helps analyze 
the data stream in a specific timescale. Each sliding 
window contains a fixed width of data elements. The 
data will be loaded and processed in specific timescale 
ahead of current time. After that, data elements are 
implicitly deleted from specific sliding window, when it 
moves out of the window scope. However, the use of 
such a model focuses on the basis of timescale, and 
must be adjusted based on different conditions and 
different circumstances. 
The data stream is considered as the same in each 
timescale in the models presented. To represent the 
importance of data in each timescale clearly, the 
Time-Fading Model [12], as such mentioned distance of 
time is also a key point of data mining was proposed. It 
separates the time into several blocks, and gives each 
timescale a different weight in descrease progressively 
from current to the past. It improves the relationship 
between data and timescale especially to those 
timeliness data. 
Using the presented models for mining the time 
series data, the quantitiy of data has to be concerned 
because of the memory size. In Lamdmark Model, it 
may take: 
 
 
 
to record the data in one month with the smallest 
measurement unit is one minute. In order to overcome 
this storage problem, Tilted-Time Window [13] was 
proposed. The timescale will be divided into different 
sections from the nearest one to the farthest one. The 
nearer sections will be more detail.. 
With the same example, the total memory costs 
will be: 
 
In this research, we pay emphasis on the 
focus-to-date LOs, and to estimate the importance 
degree of them by using the mining methodologies, 
especially the Time-Fading Model and Tilted-Time 
Window Model, presented. The LOs over a long period 
of time will be considered in a macro perspective 
through the integration of these methodologies. 
 
3. Proposed Methodologies 
 
It is meaningful to use metadata of LOs in their life 
cycle to rank and recommend LOs, as described in [14]. 
In addition, it is possible to improve user experiences 
through metadata calculation. The incidence graph of 
the LOs is used to find out the relations among LOs. We 
propose a mechanism for weighting and ranking LOs by 
recording the citation impacts from users (i.e., users of 
authoring tool and users of LMS). In this research, the 
citations can be considered as the download frequency 
of specific LOs. Thus, for learning object (LO1), we 
have the Citation Reference (CR(LO1)) from the MINE 
Registry system [15] and the value will be a positive 
integer. According to this citation value, we can realize 
the importance degree of LOs. The higher citation value 
the LO has, the more popularity it is. Then, we further 
use the following methods: 
 Author Reference (AR): System will collect citations 
of LOs created by same author and will sum them up. 
We could keep trace of the status of LOs according 
to the relationship between the author and the LOs 
through how many times the specific LO is 
downloaded. Thus, the citations of a newly created 
LO are set to zero. 
 Time Reference (TR): It represents the number of 
citations in a specific timescale. If the citation of a 
specific LO increases suddenly in a timescale but 
utilize just a few times in the following days, it may 
not be evaluated simply through AR. We have to 
consider the citations in specific timescale that LO 
has. Hence, TR can be utilized to record the time LO 
persisted and its corresponding citations to improve 
the accuracy of the weight of LO. 
In accordance with the parameters (CR, AR, and TR) 
discussed above, we can give weights to the LOs in our 
system (and other LOs imported). It is similar to any 
search mechanism (e.g., Google search), which utilizes 
thousands of rules to make search results accurate. We 
make use of the three parameters above with different 
thresholds, according to the following formula: 
 
 
                               
(2)                                                      
However, formula (2) has two problems: (a) The 
value of CR(LOA) might be extremely high (e.g. 9999) 
or extremely small (e.g. 1), without normalized 
measurement; (b) We have to withdraw some old data 
according to the TR. But we also have to modify CR and 
AR according to the changes of TR. The revision of the 
formula is shown as following: 
 
  
        check if ((  ≤ 0) & (Po < Ne)) { Rv +=  
 } 
        else if ((  > 0) & (Po > Ne)) 
{  } 
     else 
         check if (  > 0) { Rv +=   } 
         else if (  < 0) { Rv +=   } 
         else continue 
7 : Return Rv 
For instance, The age of LO1 is 2 month and 6.5 
days (68.5 days in total). The citations are 650 times in 
two month, 250 times in 6 days and 100 times in the last 
half day. According to (4), we can obtain the weight of 
each timescale as follows: 
 
 
 
Similarly, we calculate the values of W2 and W3, 
and we can obtain 0.08 and 0.01 respectively. In this 
instance, LO1 is the only LO created by a specific author, 
the β shall be 0. Another key point of obtaining the 
weight of LO1 is the feedback from past users. In 
accordance with the record from our repository, there 
are 375 user feedbacks in recent 68.5 days where there 
are 500 feedbacks from LO1 has been created. The 
calculation process for the weight of LO1 is shown in 
following table. 
 
Weight Value of LO1 
1. The citations and frequency: 
Period Citations 
0.5 days 100 
6 days 250 
62 day (2 months) 650 
2. Weight value for each section: 
Period Weight 
W1 (0.5 days) 0.91 
W2 (6 days) 0.08 
W3 (62 days) 0.01 
3. Threshold for our proposed formula: 
β = 0 
Assumed that α= 0.5 and γ= 0.5 
4. The feedback scores and the number of responses for LOA will be: 
FB(0.19, LO1) = 375 
FB(LO1) = 500 
5. Placing the thresholds and parameters into our formula: 
 
 
We calculate the citations of LOs in a certain 
timescale, but it does not mean that selected timescale 
will be the most appropriate one. System administrators 
or instructors can change it to meet different scenario’s 
situations. 
 
 
Fig. 1. The measure unit of proposed model 
Fig. 1 shows the similarity between LO1 and other 
LOs. We assumed that LO2, LO3, LO4 and LO5 have 
relations with LO1. In e-learning field, the most efficient 
way to compare LOs is to utilize the IEEE LOM to 
assist users in searching for LO. But, not all of them are 
feasible for similarity comparison. We only select 9 
representative elements (SE) in two LOM categories to 
strengthen the educational usage. 
 General: 
Title, Language, Keyword, Coverage 
 Educational:  
LearningResourceType, IntendedEndUser-Role, 
TypicalAgeRange, Difficulty, TypicalLearningTime 
The detail calculation process is shown in the 
following table. 
 
Similarity( ) 
1 : initialize elements array Em[rw][sx], En[ry][sz] for LOm 
and LOn, where rw, ry א  ሼIEEE LOM Categoriesሽ,  and 
sx, sz א ሼelements in corresponding categoryሽ 
2 : initialize the selected elements array SE, SE א  {title, 
language, …, typicallearningtime} 
3 : for each itmes in r1 { 
check if (r1 equals to r2) 
     if (r1 not exists in SE) 
         Simtemp +=  
     else 
         Simtemp +=  
else continue } 
4 : return Simtemp 
 
We utilize the Cosine Similarity Coefficient as the 
major calculation methodology and make use of the 
selected LOM elements (SE) to adjust the original 
similarity between LOs (based on the existence of 
selected elements (SE’)). The results emphasize more 
on the educational usage, because lots of selected 
elements are required fields in IEEE LOM specification. 
It may reduce the difficulty while calculating the 
similarity when there are less empty fileds in their 
metadata. According to the (6) and the similarity 
algorithm, the ranking formula for LOs in this paper is 
proposed as follows: 
 
             
(7) 
 
Formula (6) shows how to weight LOs. After 
getting the weight of each LO, we rank these LOs 
through formula (7). The main reason is to assist users 
in retrieving relevant LOs when they use the search 
service provided in our repository. The search result list 
will appear with relevant degree. In this situation, the 
learners can get the relevant resources to learn, and on 
the other side, the authors can spend less time on 
finding out the resources to edit learning materials. 
In information retrieval literature, researches utilize 
the TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document 
Frequency) [16] to get the real weight of test data. The 
weight for a term often indicates the frequency that the

standard, as depicted in figure 1. Figure 1 includes the 
MR-BS frame structure and the transparent RS frame 
structure. One transmission frame could be divided into 
DL sub-frame and UL sub-frame. The DL sub-frame of 
MR-BS is divided into two zones. One is DL Access Zone for 
MS and RS, and another one is DL Transparent Zone in Silent 
Mode. The UL sub-frame of MR-BS is divided into UL Access 
Zone and UL Relay Zone. The DL sub-frame of transparent RS 
is divided into DL Access Zone in Receiving Mode and DL 
Transparent Zone. The UL sub-frame of transparent RS is 
divided into UL Access Zone and UL Relay Zone in 
Transmitting Mode. The RS supports the relaying when the 
transmission between BS and MS is decided to use two-hop 
relaying. The packet from BS is delivered to RS by and relay to 
MS in downlink transmission, and the packet from MS is 
delivered to RS and relay to BS in uplink transmission.  
(b) Non-Transparent RS 
The frame structure of a non-transparent RS is based on the 
two-hop transparent relaying specified in the IEEE 802.16j 
standard, as depicted in figure 2. The frame structure in figure 2 
includes the MR-BS frame structure and the non-transparent RS 
frame structure. The DL sub-frame of MR-BS is divided into DL 
Access Zone and DL Relay Zone. The UL sub-frame of MR-BS 
is divided into UL Access Zone for MS and UL Relay Zone.  
 
Figure 2. MR-BS and Non-Transparent RS 
In the network system with non-transparent RS architecture, 
the non-transparent RS supports the relaying when the 
transmission between BS and MS is decided to use two-hop 
relaying.  
The relay station architecture which is added to the new 
standard, IEEE 802.16j, gives more challenges to the scheduling 
issue. Because of the difference in RS’s functionality the 
scheduling scheme could be classified into two modes, that is 
centralized scheduling and distributed scheduling. In centralized 
scheduling mode, the BS needs to handle all of the scheduling 
information in a cell and decide the order how system serves 
each MS. However, the BS will share the scheduling overhead 
with RSs in distributed scheduling mode. For the network 
system with non-transparent RS, the system could schedule in 
both centralized and distributed mode since the non-transparent 
RS is capable of dealing with scheduling information. On the 
other hand, the network system with transparent RS should only 
schedules in centralized mode. Nevertheless, no matter which 
scheduling mode and RS the system uses, the BS is always have 
the authority to manage all of the MSs in a cell[1, 7]. 
The scheduling issue in wireless network system is close to 
resource management and the main purpose of scheduling is for 
QoS guaranteed. However, the IEEE 802.16j doesn’t make any 
provision about the scheduling mechanism hence the issue 
leaves discussion for later researches[2, 3, 5].

Figure 3. RTDS Architecture 
Our research proposes an adaptive real-time-service-based 
distributed scheduling scheme (RTDS) for IEEE 802.16j 
network system. RTDS will guarantee the QoS of the users and 
enhance the efficiency of the network system by assigning and 
adjusting bandwidth dynamically. The main goal of RTDS is to 
satisfy all connections’ requests as far as possible. 
Figure 3 is the scheduling architecture of RTDS. In this 
paper, we divide chapter three into three parts to make a detail 
description of RTDS. Part (A): Priority Assignment. Part (B): 
Resource Allocation. Part (C): Preserved Bandwidth Adjustment.

RTDS quantifies five classes of traffic type which are 
specified in the IEEE 802.16j to give an initial priority value for 
  
 (8) 
¾ PFi : the priority value to decrease. 
¾ γ : the fairness parameter, from 0% to 100%. 
To obtain the final priority value, RTDS sums up all priority 
parameters in one total priority value. The final priority value of 
each connection i is defined as: 
PPPPP FiCiDiIiTi −++=     (9) 
(B) Resource Allocation 
After RTDS obtains the final priority value of each 
connection, the following step is to allocate bandwidth to each 
connection. First of all, RTDS calculates the upper bound and 
the lower bound of bandwidth request for each connection. The 
upper bound of bandwidth request for connection i is denoted by 
bimax , and the lower bound of bandwidth request for connection i 
is denoted by bimin . The definitions of these two functions are 
defined as follow: 
)*,*min( maxmax TRNb Fiiii β=    (10) 
)*,*min( minmin TRNb Fiiii β=    (11) 
¾ Ni : the number of packets which are waiting for 
scheduling in connection i. 
¾ β i : the size of a packet. 
¾ Ri
max
: the maximum sustained traffic rate of connection i. 
¾ Rimin : the minimum reserved traffic rate of connection i. 
¾ T F : the duration of a transmission frame. 
The lower bound and upper bound of bandwidth request for 
all connections and the total bandwidth of the system will divide 
resource allocation into three conditions: (1) System bandwidth 
is greater than the upper bound. (2) System bandwidth is 
between the upper bound and the lower bound. (3) System 
bandwidth is smaller than the lower bound. 
In situation (1), RTDS will allocate the upper bound of 
bandwidth to each connection since the system has plenty of 
resource. In situation (2), RTDS allocates the lower bound of 
bandwidth to each connection to meet the basic requirement of 
QoS. After satisfying the basic requirement of Qos, RTDS will 
look for the connections which have got priority promoted by 
critical packet rating. For these connections, RTDS will allocate 
the upper bound of request by their priority value. Last, RTDS 
will allocate the remainder to each connection by the ratio of 
bandwidth request. In situation (3), RTDS must make decision to 
sacrifice some connections’ QoS provision since the total system 
bandwidth couldn’t even afford the lower bound of bandwidth 
request of every connection. RTDS will allocate the lower bound 
of bandwidth request to each connection by its priority value 
until there is no longer any system bandwidth left. 
(C) Preserved Bandwidth Adjustment 
The feature of distributed scheduling is that the BS doesn’t 
need to realize how RS making its own scheduling. This feature 
will bring lesser overhead to the BS but also bring some 
disadvantages such as the non-real time service handled by the 
BS may obtain more resource than the real time service handled 
by the RS since the BS only have the announcement of total 
bandwidth request for each RS. Therefore, RTDS builds a 
preserved bandwidth mechanism to protect the QoS of 
connections which are scheduled by RS. 
RTDS defines the bandwidth status report which is send by 
the RS in order to notify the BS of the lower bound of bandwidth 
request for real time service connections. The BS collects all of 
the bandwidth status reports and then adjusts the preserved 
bandwidth of each RS by its ratio of bandwidth request. 
4. Simulation and Results Analysis 
The simulation model refers to the IEEE 802.16j standard 
and the simulation environment is in a cell. A BS is in the center 
of the cell and its transmission range is 8 km. 6 RSs are 
spreading among the cell and the transmission range of a RS is 3 
km. The BS and RSs are in line of sight and at the distance of 5 
km. The simulation model is depicted as figure 5. 
3 km 8 km
BS
RS 2
RS 3
RS 4
RS 5

RS 6
 
Figure 5. Simulation Model 
We assume the buffer of the BS and the RS is unlimited and 
the packet size of UGS、ertPS、rtPS、nrtPS and BE are 160 
bytes、 160 bytes、 240 bytes、 120 bytes and 120 bytes, 
respectively. The time duration of a transmission frame is 5 ms. 
The generation model of calls which are made by the MSs refers 
to Poisson Distribution function in order to meet the actual 
environment. The simulation time is 30000 frames, that is 150 
seconds. 
We use a simple call admission control (CAC) to decide 
whether a connection should be accepted by the system. If the 
system could not afford the minimum bandwidth request for a 
new connection, the system will reject the request for 
connecting. 
Figure 6 shows the average delay time of real time service 
connections. RTDS suffers about 1.9 ms delay time in average. 
However, DFPQ and PQ suffer more on average delay time, 
about additionally 0.6 and 0.8 ms respectively. 
Figure 7 shows the average delay time growth by different 
system load. PQ and DFPQ will obviously increase the delay 
time when the system load is at the percentage of 50%. However, 
RTDS increases the delay time until the system load is at the 
percentage of 70%.

Abstract 
 
In line with the popularity of Internet and the 
development of search engine, users request information 
through Web-based services. Although general purpose 
searching such as one provided by Google is powerful, 
searching mechanism for specific purposes could rely 
on metadata. We followed SCORM and CORDRA 
specifications to develop a registry system, called the 
MINE Registry, for storing and sharing 20,738 
Learning Objects created in the past five years. As a 
contribution, we propose the concept of “Reusability 
Tree” to represent the relationships among relevant 
Learning Objects and to enhance CORDRA. We further 
collect relevant information while users are utilizing 
Learning Objects, such as citations and time period 
persisted. The feedbacks from community users are also 
considered as critical elements for evaluating 
significance degree of Learning Objects. Through these 
factors, we propose a mechanism to weight and rank 
Learning Objects in the MINE Registry, in addition to 
other external learning objects repositories. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
A repository [1][2] in distance learning not only 
provides a distributed storage mechanism but also 
emphasizes on the sharability and reusability of 
Learning Objects (LOs). Although the issues of 
common repository for on-line learning were addressed 
[3], representation of LOs is another key issue which 
affects the design of repository architecture [4]. 
To ensure reusability, the LOs must contain 
sufficient metadata [5] for searching, and they must be 
stored in a repository. If learning platforms, schemas of 
database, and delivering frameworks are not 
interoperable, the result would cause a low 
sharability/reusability. As a consequence and general 
requirement, an LO not only needs a common 
representation of metadata, the storage infrastructure to 
allow public searchable LOs had brought an important 
open issue for e-learning research [6]. 
In earlier works [7], Lin et al. proposed a Metadata 
Wizard framework for automatically metadata 
generation. They utilize course creators’ work and fill 
the missing parts of metadata, which in turn can 
enhance searchability. 
After that, as a significant extension, Shih et al. go 
further to find out the relations among different LOs [8], 
and assist users in creating courseware by providing 
them necessary information. As a short summary, these 
researches followed SCORM to develop a repository 
system (i.e., MINE Registry), and provide a search 
mechanism with a series of search criteria for users to 
obtain LOs. 
In this paper, based on a systematic re-examination 
of reuse scenarios from users, we propose an evaluation 
mechanism to obtain the implicit information between 
LOs and to enhance LO reuse. One scenario is when a 
LO has been registered in our repository, our system 
will calculate the importance degree (or weight) of 
specific LOs based on their relevant information (e.g., 
the creator, duration time, citations, and etc). Then, the 
LOs can be ranked in a specific order through the 
cross-calculation of the weight LOs have and the 
relevance between them and users’ input queries is. We 
propose a weighting and ranking mechanism for LOs 
based on the SCORM standard and the CORDRA 
architecture. 
 
1.1 Motivation and Contributions 
 
Although SCORM and CORDRA provide 
preliminary solutions for searching and reusing LOs, a 
few important points were missing For instance, 
CORDRA pays more attention on sharing and 
discovering LOs than SCORM. After LOs were created 
and registered to the repository, they might be reused by 
other users. In this situation, the external information, 
such as citations or persisted time period, may change 
the significance of LOs. A huge amount of past LOs 
may increase the difficulty to discover and thus to share 
more recent and useful LOs. For instance, the training 
courseware with topic “Grid Computing” may have 
lower priority than the one which instructs “Cloud 
Computing” recently even though the amount of former 
LOs is much greater than the later one. We utilize the 
external information of LOs to provide an efficient 
mechanism for evaluating LOs based on CORDRA 
framework. We give each LO a weight and calculate the 
relevance between LOs. We can utilize the results to 
represent the importance degree of the LOs in different 
situation. 
The organization of this paper is as follows. 
Section 2 gives a brief introduction to the relevant 
technologies. The core methodologies including 
weighting and ranking are described in Section 3. We 
conclude this work and address our future works in 
Section 4. In the appendix, we demonstrate concrete 
examples to illustrate how our repository works, how 
  
Let  CR(Ts, LOi) ك CR(LOi) 
       AR(Ts, LOi) ك AR(LOi) 
where |Ts| ≥ 0; 
 
 
                                                                
(3) 
 
CR(Ts, LOi) represents the citations for a specific 
learning object i in a selected timescale (Ts). The 
measurement unit for Ts can be assumed to be a year, 
and set by an administrator or instructor. AR(Ts, LOi) 
stands for the author references in Ts. With 
normalization, formula (3) can provide a preliminary 
soluction which may caused by problem (a). It is no 
evidence showing that the citations in certain years are 
in fact within the optimal timescale. In this research, we 
use three years as the default setting. In addition to the 
further normalization of the pro-posed formula, we also 
take time series into consideration. It is reasonable to 
revise the proposed formula by integrating the 
Tilted-Time Window Model in order to separate time in 
different length. We separate time into units like “half 
day (12 hours)”, “one day (24 hours)”, “one month (31 
days)”, “one year (12 months), and “10 years”. Thus, 
we integrate the Time-fading Model to calculate the 
weights of LOs as follows. 
 
                                                                            
(4) 
 
where the W(LOi)j represents for the weight of LOi 
in a specific timescale Dj. The n is the number of exact 
time unit that we set for obtaining different weight of 
specific LOi. For instance, the weight of LO1 in D1 will 
be W(LO1)1, and the weight of LO1 in D2 will be 
W(LO1)2. 
According to the Time-Fading Model, the weight 
of the lateset information shall be greatest. Thus, the 
weight of the smallest unit (the rightest one in each 
section) will be greater than or equal to the sum of 
previous ones. Similarly, the weight of the latest LO 
shall be set to the greatest one. Thus, we have to change 
the order of the sections (i.e., parameters of n) in (4). 
For instance, if we have three sections (“half day”, “one 
day”, and “one month”), the n shall be “3”, ”2”, and “1”, 
respectively. 
According to the citations and weights in a specific 
time span, we could define the following formula for the 
weights of LOs. 
 
                                                                       
(5) 
 
According to the calculation for LO1 in (5), the 
parameters are retrieved based on the citation numbers 
provided by our repository. Inspired by the concept in 
Web 2.0 and social network, we also take end user 
evaluation into account. This strategy is similar to the 
evaluation mechanism used in the YouTube and the 
Google Social Search. Thus, we add a social evaluation 
mechanism, the response feedbacks for specific learning 
object (FB(LO1)), into our repository to collect 
subjective opinion from users. The time series problem 
is also considered. Therefore, we revise our formula to 
the following: 
 
 
 
                                     
(6) 
 
The feedbacks in different timescale, FBሺTs,LOሻi, 
is also considered in (6). Users will be asked to leave 
feedbacks to the results computed by their input queries. 
After continuous calculation, the feedbacks of LO can 
be categorized among two results (Negative, Positive) 
from previous users. Specifically, we separate the 
feedback information into five categories and give each 
of them a different relevancy coefficient. The instance 
of our interface for collecting the feedbacks of specific 
LOs will be shown in the appendix. In our repository, 
the algorithm we utilize to calculate the feedback from 
users is shown as followed. 
 
FeedbackRatingCalculation( ) 
1  :  set the rating scores array, RS = {-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 
1} 
2  :  the number of search results Ri , |i| = {0, 1, 
2, …, N} 
3 : Initialize Ri with current rating values and numbers 
of positive and negative feedbacks, Ri(Rv, Po, Ne) 
4 : check scores ( ) given by users, |t|={0, 1, 2, …, 
N} 
5 : calculate the numbers of positive and negative 
feedbacks 
         if  < 0 { Ne += -1 } else { Po += 1 } 
6 : if Rv > 0 
        check if ((  ≥ 0) & (Po > Ne)) { Rv +=  
 } 
        else if ((  < 0) & (Po < Ne)) 
{  } 
     else if Rv < 0 
  
query terms used. The weight also shows the relevant 
degree between query terms and test data. In this paper, 
we do not utilize TF-IDF as the methodology for full 
text scanning in learning content. It will not only cause 
additional waste of memory but also restrict the result. 
The purpose of LOM is for searching. Thus, we have to 
transform the query terms into index array and compare 
the metadata in order to obtain similarity value. After 
calculating similarity, we calculate the ranking values. 
Since LO2 was derived from LO1, LO2 should return 
parts of its weight back to LO1 because of the 
hierarchical relationships between LOs. To rank these 
LOs, our first step is to calculate the weight of LO1 and 
LO2. 
 
Weight of LO1 and LO2  
The weight of LO1 can be found in the previous example. We utilize the same formula to calculate 
the weight of LO2. 
 
1. Citations number and frequency: 
Period Citations 
0.5 days 20 
6 days 100 
62 day (2 month) 300 
2. Weight value for each section: 
Period Weight 
W1 (0.5 days) 0.71 
W2 (6 days) 0.24 
W3 (62 days) 0.05 
3. Threshold for our proposed formula: 
β= 0 
Assumed that α= 0.5 and γ= 0.5 
4. The feedback scores and the number of responses for LO2 will be: 
FB(0.19, LO2) = 200 
FB(LO2) = 500 
5. Use thresholds and each parameter into our formula: 
 
 
 
Therefore,  the weight of LOB is 0.26334 
 
Ranking Value of LO1 and LO2 
Assumed that LO2 is derived only from LO1, so it can be taken as LO1’s sub-LO. Besides, LO2 only 
has relation with LO1. In general situation, we can obtain the following parameters: 
Ref(LO1) = 0.43375 
Ref(LO2) = 0.26334 
n = 1 
The ranking value of LO1 will be: 
 
 
 
In this instance, if LO2 does not have any sub-LOs, 
the order of these LOs will be: LO1→LO2(in descending 
order). However, if LO2 has two sub-LOs (LO6, LO7), 
and the weight of these LOs are 0.40833 and 0.31719. 
In addition, each of them is derivated only from LO2. 
The similarities between them are 0.5916 and 0.4230. 
Thus, the order of search results will be: LO2→LO1→
LO6→LO7 (in descending order). Generally speaking, 
the ranking value will be dynamically changed based on 
their weights and the sub-LOs they have. According to 
our methodologies, both weights and ranking values can 
help represent the significant degree of retrieval 
learning objects.

Abstract 
Our research proposes an adaptive real-time-service-based 
distributed scheduling scheme (RTDS) for wireless network 
system with the Non-Transparent RS architecture which is 
specified in the IEEE 802.16j standard. The main object of our 
research is to utilize the RS to decrease the overhead of the BS 
and enhance the QoS of the real time service connections. We 
obtain the initial priority value for the order of scheduling 
through the quantification of each service type specified in IEEE 
802.16 standard. The priority value varies according to the 
bandwidth request and the channel status of each connection, 
and it may be increased by a emergency packet event or 
decreased by taking fairness into consideration. The simulation 
results show that our proposed scheduling scheme performs 
better than other representative researches and also additionally 
guarantees the QoS of real time service connections.

1. Introduction 
The internet service has become the necessity of modern 
society. The demand of internet results in spreading internet 
constructions no matter in urban area or countryside. The wired 
network system meets more restrictions and suffers more 
difficulties. To save the cost of construction time and decrease 
the construction complexity when deploying wired network in a 
developed city, the wireless network system seems a better 
solution. WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave 
Access) system is the mainstream of wireless network 
technology. The IEEE 802.16 standard is developed 
 
as the guideline of  WiMAX system. The main object of the 
standard is to ensure that the device from different 
manufacturers won’t cause the compatibility problems[4, 8]. 
For the convenience of using internet resource, the goal of 
wireless network system is to provide network service as 
possible as it could. However, providing network service to a 
blind spot or a sparsely populated area by a BS usually 
substantially increases the cost to system suppliers. The RS 
architecture which is specified in the IEEE 802.16j, as the 
extension of IEEE 802.16, could overcome these problems by 
multi-hop relaying technology[6]. 
2. Related Works 
To overcome the compatibility problems to the existing 
WiMAX system and unify the specifications from different 
manufacturers, the IEEE 802.16j working group is dedicated to 
establish the standard of multi-hop relay technology. The relay 
technology is a new issue because of the integration of relay 
station and the existing network system.  
Relay stations can be classified into two classes by whether 
the Preamble and UL/DL MAP being broadcasted. The 
non-transparent RS supports the broadcasting of Preamble and 
UL/DL MAP but the transparent RS doesn’t.

scheduling order. Table 1 shows the initial priority value for five 
classes of traffic type. These values match our goal that is 
enhancing the QoS of real time service connections. There are 
five traffic types specified in the IEEE 802.16j, which are 
UGS、ertPS、rtPS、nrtPS and BE, and the initial priority value are 
5、4、3、2 and 1 respectively. Since UGS、ertPS and rtPS are real 
time services, the initial priority values of UGS、ertPS and rtPS 
are higher then nrtPS and BE. 
After the initial priority value of each connection is set, 
RTDS adjust the initial priority value to the different condition 
and request of each connection. The section of priority 
adjustment is divided into three phases which are Priority 
Promotion by Packet Delay Tolerance Rating 、 Priority 
Promotion by Packet Critical Rating and Priority Diminution, 
respectively. 
Phase one of priority adjustment is Priority Promotion by 
Packet Delay Tolerance Rating. The main idea of this phase is to 
promote the priority value of a connection by its case of packet 
delay.

Figure 4. Packet Delay Time Diagram 
Figure 4 depicts the delay time of a packet. The packet 
arrival time, denoted by T
A
, means the time when a packet 
arrives in a access station, such as BS and RS. The calculation of 
TW  is defined as: 
)()( jj TTT AiSWi −=    (1) 
¾ )( jTWi : the packet waiting time of the j’th packet of 
connection i. 
¾ T
S
: the current time of the system. 
¾ )( jT
A
i : the packet arrival time of the j’th packet of 
connection i. 
Our research defines the packet remaining halt time, denoted 
by T
H
, to indicate the legal halting time for a packet. Let the 
maximum latency of a packet minuses its packet waiting time to 
obtain T
H
, which means the packet will be a out of date packet 
after the time T
H
 and dropped. The calculation of T
H
 is 
defined as: 
)()( jj TT WiiHi −=ω    (2) 
¾ )( jT
H
i : the packet remaining halt time of the j’th packet of 
connection i. 
¾ ω i : the maximum latency of service type i. 
Our research defines the packet delay tolerance rating, 
denoted by R
D
i , to represent the average value of the packet 
remaining halt time from the same connection i. The formula is 
defined as: 
∑
=
= N ji
j
i
H
i
D
i NTR
1
/)(
     (3) 
¾ N i : the number of packets from connection i. 
In general speaking, the connections with a lower value of 
RDi  means most of the packets will be out of date soon and 
should be scheduled first. On the other hand, the connections 
with a higher value of R
D
i  means the connections could suffer 
more waiting time. Thus, our research defines a parameter for 
priority promotion, denoted by P
C
i . The function of 
normalization is defined as: 
)/(1 _RRP MAXDiDiDi −=     (4) 
Phase two of priority adjustment is Priority Promotion by 
Packet Critical Rating. The main idea of phase two is to promote 
the priority value of the connections which with packets are 
going to be out of date on the next transmission frame. Thus, the 
RTDS could satisfy the QoS of these connections. To distinguish 
a packet which is going to be out of date, the estimation formula 
is defined as: 
TT FWi ≤−ω      (5) 
¾ T
F
: the time duration of a transmission frame. 
If formula (5) stands, it means the packet will be out of date 
if it is not transmitted at the scheduling frame. And under this 
circumstance, the QoS of users will be decreased. In our 
research, we define these packets as critical packet. In general 
speaking, a connection with more critical packets will generate 
much more unsatisfied QoS and should be served earlier. We 
define critical packet rating to represent the critical degree of a 
connection, and as follows: 
∑
=
= N j
C

j
W
i
C
i TR

)(
     
 (6) 
¾ NCi : the number of critical packets in connection i. 
¾ RCi : the critical packet rating of connection i. 
We also normalize the critical packet rating to get the 
priority value to promote. The function is defined as: 
RRP MAXCiCiCi _/=      (7) 
¾ PCi : the priority value to promote. 
¾ R MAXCi _ : the maximum value of the critical packet rating 
with the same service type as connection i. 
The final phase, phase three, of priority adjustment is 
Priority Diminution. RTDS will decrease the priority value of 
the connections which get priority promoted twice by critical 
packet condition. The main idea of this phase is to offer fairness 
among the connections. The diminution function is defined as: 
γ*PP DiFi =

 Figure 8 shows the packet drop rate growth according 
to different system load. PQ will dramatically increase the drop 
rate when the system load is at the percentage of 40%. DFPQ 
will dramatically increase the drop rate when the system load is 
at the percentage of 60%. RTDS also increases the drop rate 
when the system load is at the percentage of 70%. RTDS could 
afford much more system load against to the drop rate and the 
growth curve is flatter than others.

5. Conclusion and Future Work 
 Our research proposed a distributed scheduling 
scheme, RTDS, for IEEE 802.16j networks. RTDS will allocate 
bandwidth dynamically for different types of connections to 
meet each connection’s QoS requirement. RTDS primary 
guarantees the QoS of real time service connections and 
additionally provides the fairness to every connection. The 
simulation results show that RTDS will suffer less packet delay 
time and packet loss rate than other representative researches.
