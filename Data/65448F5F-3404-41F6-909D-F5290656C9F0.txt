the most promising TCOs owing to its 
non-toxicity, less expensive, more resistant to 
defect, impurity doping, hydrogen plasma 
reduction[8] and can be deposited at lower 
temperature [9,10]. 
As a satisfactory front contact materials for 
photovoltaic applications, the TCOs films has to 
be highly conductive for good current transport 
to obtain low series resistance and highly 
transparent for the incident sunlight to reduce the 
absorption losses[11]. Moreover, an adapted 
surface topography for better light scattering and 
subsequent light trapping inside the silicon based 
solar cells is necessary. Surface textured TCO 
with light trapping structures can facilitate 
optical reflection, refraction, and scattering by a 
suitably rough surface to scatter the incident light 
[12,13]. The light scattering capability of the 
TCO front electrode depends on the dimensional 
features and surface morphology[14-16]. 
Polycrystalline ZnO films are readily etched in 
many acidic and alkaline solutions [7,14-18]. Up 
to now, there is no theoretical model to predict 
the wet-chemical etching behavior of 
polycrystalline AZO films as functions of 
processing parameters. However, a systematic 
approach to elucidate the properties of textured 
AZO films by different wet chemical solutions 
was quite rare. In this study, a comprehensive 
study for the surface textured Al-doped ZnO 
films by wet etching with three different 
mediums was illustrated. The influence of 
structural, electrical and optical properties of the 
resultant films as a function of texturing medium 
and time period was investigated to obtain the 
desirable front electrodes materials with good 
light-trapping properties for thin film silicon 
solar cells applications. 
 
2. Experimental 
All films were deposited onto soda-lime glass 
substrate by pulse DC magnetron sputtering using 
a ceramic AZO target 76mm in diameter, 
ZnO:Al2O3(2.0 wt.%). The sputtering chamber 
was pumped down to 6.65×10-6 Pa by cryogenic 
pump in which the AZO target was exposed to Ar 
plasma for 5min to clean the target surface. Since 
the optoelectronic properties of the films are very 
sensitive to the deposition conditions, the 
fine-tuned optimal parameters turned to be that: 
substrates temperature keeping at 473K, working 
distance between the target and the substrate was 
5.5cm, pulse frequency 10kHz by modulating 
pulse sputter process parameters such as: power 
150 W,  working pressure 0.4Pa and duty cycle 
95%, respectively. All of the films used in the 
following wet-chemical etch have identical 
deposition parameters, if without further 
notification. After baseline calibration, the 
deposition rate and thickness were determined by 
α-step (Kosaka laboratory Lt.d.ET3000). The 
films morphology was characterized by FE-SEM 
(JEOL JSM 7000F) and atomic force microscope 
(AFM, Q-Scope 350). X-ray diffraction (XRD, 
CuKα, λ=1.54052Å, Shimadzu XD-6000) was 
used to analyze the crystalline structure of the 
deposited film. A typical θ-2θ scan by 
Brag-Brentano geometry gives valuable 
information in both the crystallinity and grain size 
of the deposited thin films [13,14,17,18]. The 
intensity of XRD patterns has been normalized to 
the film thickness as the absorption depth of X-ray 
was considered. The electrical properties of the 
films were examined using Hall-effect 
measurements (ECOPIA HMS-2000). Only the 
films with lowest resistivity and optical 
transmittance greater than 78% in every batch 
were choose for further investigation. 
Quantitatively, the light scattering can be 
evaluated by the so-called haze value, i.e. the ratio 
of diffuse to total light transmission as defined by 
eq.(1).  
Haze =Tdiffuse/ Ttotal                           (1) 
Ttotal=Tdiffuse+Tspecular                         (2) 
 
The total transmittance (Ttotal) and specular 
transmittance (Tspecular) defined in eq.(2) was 
measured by the angle-adjustable and 
multifunctional optical characterization system 
(Hong-Ming MFS-630) with wavelength 
400~800nm. Wet chemical etching experiments 
were conducted at 300K and compared 
separately in three different etching solutions: 
The etch time was: (1).0.5% HClaq for 15, 30, 
and 45s, (2). 5% oxalic acid (HOOC-COOH) 
solution for 75, 150 and 225s, and (3).33% 
KOHaq. for 45, 90 and 135s which corresponding 
to film thickness of 800(initial), 700, 600, 500 
nm, respectively. 
 
3.Results and Discussion  
3-1 Etched in 0.5% HCl solution 
We developed the surface morphology of 
AZO films which etched in 0.5% HCl(aq.) at 300K 
with different etch time. Fig.1 shows the SEM 
images of the as-deposited films(a) and after 
different etching (b~d). The tilt angles for the 
textured AZO films as function of etch time in

s.

time in 0.5% HCl solution. 
Fig. 5 shows typical optical transmittance 
spectra of the texture-etched films at various 
etching time as function of wavelength. All the 
films exhibited apparent variation of transmittance 
as the result of interference phenomena were 
attributed to the uniform thickness of the textured 
films [1,10]. The spectral haze serves as an 
indicator for the light scattering properties of the 
texture etched ZnO:Al films as shown by Klutha 
et al.[20]. For amorphous silicon p-i-n solar cells 
co-depositing on smooth and texture etched ZnO 
coated glass substrates, those prepared on the 
textured ZnO exhibits an increase in short-circuit 
current density jsc by 3.3mA/cm2 as compared to 
those deposited on the smooth ZnO. This 
improvement is due to an effective light trapping 
in the long wavelength region. In our study, owing 
to the improvement of light-trapping effect, the 
Tdifuse and HT increased with time while the Ttotal 
decreased along with the etching time as some 
compact structures has been destroyed by etching 
in HCl. The total transmittance (Fig.6) declined at 
first 15s after which the alteration in optical 
transmittance was meager until 30s. For prolonged 
etching over 45s, the Ttotal declined to 89% of its 
original value and both the total diffused 
transmittance (Tdiffused) and total Haze(HT) 
increased considerably which showed that the 
efficiently texturing effect by HCl could be 
achieved at very short period of time. Besides, the 
reduced free carrier absorption owing to the 
decrease of carrier concentration (Fig.3) didn’t 
make significant improvement in optical 
transparency as those described elsewhere in 
which the total transmittance increase as the etch 
time increase because of the decrease in the film 
thickness[17]. In light of diffuse transmittance, the 
HCl etch indeed made no significant contribution 
at first 10s while for prolonged etching, the 
resultant moon surface like landscape with large 
crates and etch holes is responsible for the surge in 
diffuse transmittance as well as haze value. Kluth 
et al. [20] found that the sample textured with a 
haze value of 0.23 at 550nm wavelength light had 
a better short-circuit current density than the 
smooth AZO substrate. In this study, the sample 
etched in HClaq. for 45s has maximum haze value 
of HT=0.28. Nevertheless, at this time the 
resistivity was soared into 1.46×10-3Ω-cm which 
was too high to be used. In contrast, a more 
reasonable value of 30s etching time was chooses 
to get the lower resistivity, ρ =8.54×10-4Ω-cm 
with acceptable visible transmittance, Ttotal=78.4% 
and haze value, HT =0.09 as desirable front 
electrode material for thin films solar cell 
applications.

as function of etch time in 5% oxalic acid solution 
 
Typical optical transmittance spectra of the 
texture-etched AZO films in oxalic acid solution 
were depicted in Fig.11. It is noteworthy that 
wavelength dependence is quite different to those 
etched by oxalic acid solution in that the total 
transmittance of the samples did exceed to those 
etched with shorter time, 150s. After some of the 
disorder loosely-packed overlayers had been 
removed, the total haze (HT) owing to the 
intensified light-trapping was increased by etching 
(Fig. 12). At this point, Ttotal declined considerably 
with etch time. However, the improved 
light-trapping let the Tdifuse and HT increase 
accordingly which showed that a 5% oxalic acid 
solution was sufficed to texture the AZO surface 
efficiently. The reduction in visible transmittance 
is due to carrier scattering. In summary, the 
sample etched in oxalic acid solution for more 
than 150s has haze value greater than 0.23 while 
the resistivity was as low as 7.91×10-4 Ω-cm with 
visible transmittance of 72.1% which is acceptable 
as the front electrode material for thin films solar 
cell applications.

function of etch time in 5% oxalic acid solution. 
 
3.3Etched in 33% KOH solution 
The topography of polycrystalline ZnO has 
shown a strong dependence of etching behavior on 
the crystal planes and etchant solution [7]. Besides, 
the etch rate is governed by factors such as the 
formula of the etch solution, the composition and 
density of the films, processing time and 
temperature, etc. For comprehensive 
understanding of the etch behavior in etching 
solution with different chemical nature, a 33% 
KOH solution was chose for comparison with 
those textured in acidic medium. KOH solution 
attacks the AZO films surface randomly at certain 
points in which deep and steep holes are formed 
with rugged moon landscape-like surface 
appearance after etching for 45s as shown in 
Fig.13. The AFM topography shown in Fig.14 
indicated that δrms increases steadily with the etch 
time. The etch rate in 33% KOH solution was far 
smaller than that in 0.5% HCl solution while 
slightly larger than that in 5% oxalic acid solution 
and estimated to be 2.3 nms-1. The carrier

4. Conclusions 
In this study, pulsed DC magnetron 
sputtering was used to prepare AZO thin films on 
glass substrates. After the thin film was deposited, 
the wet etching process with 0.5 % HCl; 5 % 
Oxalic acid,and 33 % KOH solutions was 
conducted on the specimens to obtain the ideal 
light trapping structure for thin film solar cells. 
The resultant films etched in 0.5% HCl solution 
for 30 seconds exhibited high Ttotal=78.4% with 
haze value, HT = 0.1 and good electrical properties, 
ρ=8.5×10-4Ωcm while those etched in 5% oxalic 
acid for 150s had desirable HT =0.23 and 
relatively low electrical resistivity, 
ρ=7.9×10-4Ωcm. However, the visible 
transmittance, Ttotal was declined to 72.1%.
