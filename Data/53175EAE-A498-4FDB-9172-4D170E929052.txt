 1. Introduction 
The primary goal of the research in constrained elastica is to understand the 
behavior of a thin elastic strip under edge thrust when it is subject to lateral surface 
constraints. It finds applications in a variety of practical problems, such as in 
compliant foil journal bearings, corrugated fiberboard, deep drilling, structural core 
sandwich panels, sheet forming, non-woven fabrics manufacturing, and stent 
deployment procedures. By assuming small deformation, Feodosyev (1977) included 
the problem of a pinned-pinned buckled beam constrained by a pair of parallel walls 
as an exercise for a university strength and material course. Adan et al. (1994) showed 
that when a column with initial imperfection positioned at a distance from a plane 
wall is subject to compression, contact zones may develop leading to buckling mode 
transition. Domokos et al. (1997) and Chai (1998, 2002) investigated the planar 
buckling patterns of an elastica constrained inside a pair of parallel plane walls. It was 
observed that both point contact and line contact with the constraint walls are possible. 
Roman and Pocheau (1999, 2002) used an elastica model to investigate the response 
of a buckled thin plate subject to prescribed height reduction. Kuru et al. (2000) 
studied the buckling behavior of drilling pipes in directional wells. Chen and Li (2007) 
and Lu and Chen (2008) studied the deformation of a planar elastica inside a circular 
channel with clearance.  
The emphasis of these studies was placed on the static deformations of the 
constrained elastica. Very often, multiple equilibria under a specified set of loading 
condition are possible. In order to determine whether a calculated deformation exists 
in reality, a stability analysis is needed. There is, however, no theory available to 
determine the stability of these equilibrium configurations. As a consequence, 
experimental observation has been an important tool to validate the existence of a 
calculated equilibrium in reality in previous researches. The purpose of this paper is to 
present a theoretical approach which is capable of predicting the stability of a 
constrained elastica deformation. 
In constrained elastica the lateral constraint is unilateral, i.e., it can exert 
compression but not tension onto the elastica. Mathematically, this type of constraints 
can be represented by a set of inequality equations. This poses challenges in 
determining the critical states of the loaded structure. Frequently, energy method 
based on the extended principle of total potential is adopted (Villaggio, 1979), 
assuming that the loaded system is conservative. Klarbring (1988) demonstrated that 
non-smooth bifurcation points, corner limit points, and end points may exist in 
unilaterally constrained structures. Schulz and Pellegrino (2000) showed that the 
equilibrium equations for a multi-body system subject to unilateral constraints have 
the same form as the standard Kuhn-Tucker conditions in optimization theory.

2. Problem description 
Fig. 1 shows an inextensible elastic strip with the right end fully clamped at 
point B. The flexural rigidity and the mass density per unit length of the elastic strip 
are EI and μ , respectively. On the left hand side there is a straight channel with an 
opening at point A. The distance between points A and B is L . Part of the strip is 
allowed to slide without friction and clearance inside the channel. Edge thrust *AF  is 
applied at the left end of the strip causing it to buckle in the domain of interest 
between points A and B. The boundary condition at point A may be called “partially 
clamped,” by which we mean that the strip is allowed to slide freely through the 
opening A, while the lateral displacement and slope at A are fixed. An 
* *x y -coordinate system is fixed at point A. A set of parallel plane walls at * *y h= ±  
prevents the elastica from deforming freely. In Fig. 1 the elastica contacts the walls at 
two points W1 and W2 at * *1s l=  and *2l , where *s  is the length of the elastica 
measured from point A. The total length *l  of the elastica between A and B varies as 
the edge thrust increases. It is noted that in most of the previous works on constrained 
elastica, the total length of the elastica is fixed, except in Chen and Li (2007) and Lu 
and Chen (2008).

Static analysis allows us to find all the possible equilibrium configurations as 
shown in Fig. 2. However, not all these equilibrium configurations are stable. In this 
paper we develop a dynamic method to calculate the natural frequencies of each 
equilibrium state. If all the natural frequencies are real and greater than zero, the 
equilibrium configuration is stable and the associated locus is traced with solid line. If 
any one of the natural frequencies is imaginary, the equilibrium state is unstable and 
the associated locus is traced with dashed line. If all the natural frequencies are real 
but at least one of them is zero, the stability of the equilibrium state cannot be 
determined from the linear vibration analysis. We refer this type of solution as neutral, 
and the associated locus is traced with dotted line. The stability properties of the 
constrained elastica are dependent upon the loading mechanism at point A. The 
stability properties presented in Fig. 2 are for a constrained elatica under load control.  
It is noted that the slopes of all the loci in sheet 0 are negative. The 
corresponding deformations are all unstable. Take locus 1 as an example. The elastic 
strip buckles at point a via a sub-critical bifurcation. We expect that the elastic strip 
jumps from point a to a point slightly above point f on locus 4 as the edge thrust 
increases quasi-statically. It is noted that this type of sub-critical bifurcation is due to 
the variable-length feature of the elastica, see Wang et al. (1998) and Chen and Ro 
(2010). A column with fixed length (Domokos et al., 1997; Chai, 1998) will buckle 
via a super-critical bifurcation with the nontrivial equilibrium path rising as the load 
increases. There will be no jump in the fixed-length problem.  
 Locus 7 (one-line contact) is composed of two parts; one with dotted line (7-1 
between g and h) and the other with dashed line (7-2 beyond h). The length of line 
contact increases from point g all the way to beyond h. At the bifurcation point h, the 
length of the contact segment and the axial force happen to satisfy the condition of 
Euler buckling. Another branch 9 of two-point contact emerges from point h and 
terminates at j. The bifurcation at point h is called secondary buckling by some 
researchers. It is tempting to assume that the line-contact deformation is stable until 
the secondary buckling occurs. Although this is true for a pinned-pinned elastica as 
discussed in Domokos et al. (1997), it is not necessarily true for the clamped-clamped 
case. For the constrained elastica discussed in this paper, buckling occurs earlier at 
point g instead of point h. It is noted that Chai (1998) and Roman and Pocheau (1999) 
conducted experiments on clamped-clamped elastica and did observe line-contact 
deformations, which became unstable via secondary buckling. However, in these 
experiments the plane walls are on 0y =  and h, instead of y h= ± . The reason why 
the elastica under different plane wall set-up behaves so differently will be discussed 
in more detail in Section 7. 
Locus 15 (two-line contact) is the extension of locus 10 (two-point contact) and 
 9
4. Vibration and stability analysis 
 As mentioned above, the deformation patterns discussed in Section 3 may not be 
stable. If the deformation is unstable, then it will not exist in reality. It is noted that the 
elastica may be in point or in line contact with the walls, sometimes at multiple 
locations. In this paper we assume that all the contacts are frictionless. In the 
following we introduce a vibration method which is capable of determining the 
natural frequencies and mode shapes of the constrained elastica.  
 
4.1 Two-point contact on different walls 
 We first consider the case when the equilibrium configuration involves 
two-point contact on different walls, such as the one corresponding to locus 10 in Fig. 
2. The deformation pattern is also shown in Fig. 1. The two contact points W1 and W2 
are at s= 1l  and 2l , respectively. This analysis can be readily extended to other 
contact situations. 
   
4.1.1 Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions

elastica at the contact point. ( )⋅δ  is the dimensionless Dirac delta function. Eq. (6) is 
valid for the elastica between points A and W2, i.e., for 20 ls << . These six 
equations can be called the Lagrangian version of the governing equations. s may be

4.1.3 Contact conditions 
During vibration, the elastica is always in contact with and is allowed to slide on 
the wall without friction. The exact contact condition at W1 can be written as  
   0)(ˆ),(

    0)(ˆ
11
1 ==ldy εε          (47) 
Similarly, the contact conditions at W2 are 
 15
dyR 1  and dyR 2  at the contact points. It is noted that ω  in Eqs. (30)-(31) only 
appears in the form of 2ω . Therefore, if the characteristic value 2ω  is positive, the 
corresponding mode is stable with natural frequency ω . On the other hand, the 
equilibrium configuration is unstable if 2ω  is negative.  
A shooting method is used to solve for the characteristic value 2ω . We first set 
01 1
)(ˆ
=εεdM =1. After guessing seven variables 01 1)(ˆ =εεydF , 1ydR , 2ydR , d0η , d1η , 
d2η , and 2ω , we can integrate Eqs. (26)-(31) like an initial value problem all the way 
from 01 =ε  to 21 l=ε . The four boundary conditions (37)-(40) at point A provide 
the needed initial conditions. At 21 l=ε  the six values of

according to the transition equations similar to Eq. (52). From here on 2ε  becomes 
the independent variable and the integration continues until l=2ε . The three 
boundary conditions (41)-(43) at l=2ε , two contact equations (46)-(47) at 11 l=ε , 
and two contact conditions (48)-(49) at 22 l=ε  are used to check the accuracy of the 
seven guesses. If the guesses are not satisfactory, a new set of guesses is adopted.  
 
4.2 Other contact situations  
The above analysis can be readily extended to other point-contact cases. For 
instance, for one-point contact, only one Eulerian coordinate 1ε  is needed. For 
three-point contact, three Eulerian coordinates 1ε , 2ε , and 3ε  are needed.  
The vibration analysis of one-line contact is similar to the one in the two-point 
contact situation discussed in section 4.1. In the analysis the two ends of the contact 
segment are treated as the two points W1 and W2 in section 4.1. The main difference is 
that in the line-contact case the calculated mode shape must be checked whether it 
violates the wall constraint. If a mode shape penetrates the wall during vibration, the 
mode is invalid and must be discarded. The analysis of two-line contact is similar, 
although more complicated. Four Eulerian coordinates 1ε , 2ε , 3ε , and 4ε  must be 
defined in the case of two-line contact.  
 
4.3 Numerical results and discussions 
4.3.1 Transition from one-point to one-line contact

2ω  locus with solid line. The second and the third modes have zero 2ω  and the 
corresponding mode shapes are similar to the ones in Figs. 5 (a) and (b). The fourth 
mode at 2ω =9078.91 is shown in Fig. 6. This mode is invalid because it does not 
comply with the wall constraint at any time.  
 
4.3.2 Transition from two-point to two-line contact 
We now examine the dynamic characteristics of the equilibrium configurations 
on loci 10, 15-1, 15-2, and 19 (passing points i, k, m, and r). Fig. 7 shows the first 
four 2ω  as functions of the length increment lΔ  starting from 0.1005 (point i). We 
choose lΔ  as an independent parameter in Fig. 7 instead of AF  because 2ω  is a 
single-valued function of lΔ  in this range, but not AF . In the range from point i to k, 
all the 2ω  are positive. Therefore, all the two-point contact deformations 
corresponding to locus 10 in Fig. 2 are stable. It is noted that the first three 2ω  
approach zero together at point k, and remain zero until point r.    
In the range between points k and m, the lowest three 2ω  are zero. As a 
consequence, the stability is inconclusive for locus 15-1. In the range between points 
m and r, the lowest 2ω  is negative. Therefore, the two-line contact deformation 
corresponding to locus 15-2 is unstable. Fig. 8 shows the first four mode shapes when 
( AF , lΔ )=(6.865, 0.2). The three mode shapes corresponding to the degenerate natural 
frequencies of zero are shown in Figs. 8(b), (c), and (d). In each of these modes, only 
one of the three non-contact segments moves during vibration.  
As lΔ  increases beyond point r, the deformation evolves back to two-point 
contact (locus 19) and the three degenerate natural frequencies of zero break up. The 
first four 2ω  when ( AF , lΔ ) =(2.300, 0.3) are − 2359.74, 36.93, 1910.64, and 
1958.08. Since the lowest 2ω  is negative, this two-point contact deformation is 
unstable.

6. Load-control experiment 
 The foregoing vibration analysis indicates that the stability of line-contact 
deformations 7-1 and 15-1 is inconclusive, both in load and displacement controls. In 
order to observe what would happen in reality we designed an experimental set-up for 
load control, whose top view is shown in Fig. 10. The elastica is made of carbon steel 
(type SK5) with Young’s modulus 205 GPa and mass density 7830 kg/ 3m . The cross 
section of the elastica is 46 mm× 0.1 mm. The right end of the strip is fully clamped 
in an aluminum block, which corresponds to point B in Fig. 1. To simulate the partial 
clamp on the left end of the domain of interest we installed two pairs of rollers in 
another aluminum block. This design ensures that the strip in the partial clamp 
remains straight before it is fed through point A. The rollers are to minimize the 
friction between the strip and the feeding channel. The distance between points A and 
B is 30 cm. The left end of the strip is fully clamped in a slider, which is allowed to 
slide along a set of guiding rods. Two strings are attached to this slider, one on the top 
and the other on the bottom. The strings pass through two pulleys, with the other end 
attached to a hanging bag. Steel screws, each weighs 11.4 g, are added to the bag to 
simulate the thrust on the left end of the strip. The wall constraint is made of a pair of 
aluminum plates. The distance between the two plane walls is 6 cm. 
The measured relations between AF  and lΔ  are plotted with black dots ● 
(loading) and cross marks ×  (unloading) in Fig. 11. The solid curves (stable 
equilibrium) in Fig. 2 are retained for comparison. For convenient reference, we add 
the physical parameters with units of AF  and lΔ  on the right and top sides of the 
diagram. At the last point before jump occurs, the black dot and cross mark are circled. 
Before the loading process, special care has to be taken to ensure that the metallic 
strip is well aligned between the two clamps, as shown in Fig. 12 (a). In the loading 
process there are three jumps as AF  increases from 0. The first jump occurs at 
( AF , lΔ )=(1.431, 0.0003) when the strip buckles and contacts the wall at one point, as 
shown in Fig. 12(b). The second jump occurs at ( AF , lΔ )=(3.702, 0.0344) when the 
strip contacts the walls at two points, as shown in Fig. 12(c). The third jump occurs at 
( AF , lΔ )=(6.622, 0.1348) when the strip contacts the walls at three points, as shown 
in Fig. 12(d). It is noted that the last two jumps are very close to the theoretical values 
at points g and k with discrepancy in AF  between theory and experiment being 0.2% 
and 5%, respectively.  
After the third jump the strip deforms in a three-point contact pattern. The 
loading process stops at AF =8.893, and from then on the unloading process begins. 
The strip deformation jumps from three-point to two-point contact when 
( AF , lΔ )=(3.053, 0.2087), and jumps from two-point to one-point contact when 
( AF , lΔ )=(2.080, 0.0935), and finally jumps back to non-contact pattern when 
 21
7. Comparison with previous works of others 
One of the unique results reported in this paper is that none of the line-contact 
deformations exist in the experiment. The elastica is found to buckle far before 
reaching the secondary buckling load. However, several previous works on 
constrained elastica did observe line-contact deformations. One is the 
clamped-clamped elastica investigated by Chai (1998) and Roman and Pocheau 
(1999), and the other is the pinned-pinned elastica discussed by Domokos et al. (1997). 
It is noted that the elastica is of fixed length in these two cases. In this section we 
confirm the validity of these previous investigations, both theoretically and 
experimentally, and propose explanations which may help us understand why the 
elasticas behave differently in different set-ups. 
 
7.1 A clamped-clamped elastica  
Chai (1998) and Roman and Pocheau (1999) conducted experiments on a 
clamped-clamped elastica and reported that line-contact deformations did exist and 
become unstable via secondary buckling. It is noted that the plane walls in these 
experiments are not symmetric with respect to the elastic strip. Instead, the walls are 
on 0y =  and h. We rearranged the experimental set-up in Fig. 10 by moving the 
plate on y= h−  to 0, a set-up similar to the experiments in Chai (1998) and Roman 
and Pocheau (1999). The measured load-deflection relations ( AF - lΔ ) are recorded in 
Fig. 14(a) with cross marks × . The theoretical predictions are also drawn in Fig. 14(a) 
for comparison. The solid, dashed, and dotted lines represent stable, unstable, and 
neutral solutions from the vibration analysis.  
We first compare the theoretical predictions on the load-deflection curves 
between Figs. 2 and 14(a). The one-point contact deformations 4 in Figs. 2 and 14(a) 
are the same. At point g deformation 4 evolves to line-contact deformation 7-1. In Fig. 
2 a point on locus 7 (including 7-1 and 7-2) represents a single deformation. However, 
in Fig. 14(a) a point on locus 7 actually represents an infinite number of “similar” 
deformations. The line contact can occur on the upper wall, the base wall, or 
combined, as long as the sum of the lengths of the line-contact segments 1δ + 2δ + 3δ  
remains the same. This situation occurs in deformation 15 of Fig. 2 as well. The 
one-line contact deformation on locus 7 in Fig. 2 is a special case with 1δ = 3δ =0. 
Furthermore, deformations 3 and 11 in Fig. 2 are prevented by the base plane wall and 
are absent in Fig. 14(a). As a result, there is no other “non-similar” deformation 
bifurcating away at point g. At point h locus 7-1 in Fig. 14(a) may bifurcate to locus 9. 
A point on locus 9 actually represents two different deformations 9a and 9b. In Fig. 2, 
on the other hand, only deformation 9a is possible. Locus 18* is a three-point contact 
deformation, which cannot be found in Fig. 2. Vibration analysis shows that the

The dynamic boundary condition =AF constant yields Eq. (40), and the contact 
conditions at the contact points W1 and W2 remain the same as in Eqs. (44)-(49). 
Fig. 15(b) shows the 2ω  as functions of AF  when the pinned-pinned elastica 
evolves from one-point to one-line contact. The gap 2h is set at 0.1, the same as in 
Domokos et al. (1997). Point f represents the start of one point contact deformation. 
The deformation evolves from point contact to line contact at point g ( AF =3.984), and 
becomes unstable via secondary buckling at point h ( AF =15.874). The natural 
frequency loci near point g are magnified and shown in the two insets. It is noted that, 
unlike the clamped-clamped case discussed in this paper, there are no degenerately 
zero natural frequencies in line-contact deformations. This vibration analysis confirms 
that the line-contact deformation before secondary buckling is stable in the 
pinned-pinned elastica investigated by Domokos et al. (1997).
