In this project, we have investigated the mechanical properties of high temperature Pb-free solders and 
joints.  The results are fruitful and can be divided into three parts.  1) Temperature effect on the 
tensile properties of the Bi-11Ag alloy, 2) Thermal properties of high temperature Pb-free solders, 
Bi-Ag, Zn-Sn and Sn-Sb-Ag, and the microstructure and shear properties at different temperatures of 
the joints between those solders and Cu substrate, 3) isothermal fatigue properties of above solder 
joints.  The results could be applied to practical uses. 
Keywords: high temperature Pb-free solder, tensile properties, shear properties, temperature effect, 
nanoindentation, isothermal fatigue. 
 
1. 前言  
    含高 Pb 之 Pb-Sn 合金長久以來一直為應
用於高溫軟銲之銲料合金，然而銲料中之 Pb
元素會造成環境的汙染，因此發展替用的高溫
無鉛銲料有其必要性。在許多開發中的高溫無
鉛銲料系統中，Bi 系合金因具有適當熔點、柔
軟度以及合理價格等優點，使之成為相當有潛
力的高鉛銲錫取代材[1]。儘管如此，Bi 系合
金仍有脆性及較差的熱導及電導性質等缺
點，因此近年來有許多學者紛紛提出針對 Bi
基合金改質方法，其中於 Bi 中添加 Ag 不僅可
以改善銲料的機械性質，當 Ag 含量提升至
11wt％時，對電阻係數、銲錫性以及硬度與拉
伸性質均有正面效應[2]。 
    在 一 般 觀 念 當 中 ， 屬 菱 面 晶 結 構
(rhombohedral)的 Bi，同時具金屬鍵及共價
鍵，被視為 semimetal，因此罕被應用於結構
材料用途。在僅有之少數報導中提到，Bi 曾做
為研究差排滑移(dislocation slip)及雙晶形變
(twinning)的 model 材料，主要差排滑移面為
{111}，雙晶形式為{110}<001> [3]。此外，提
高應變速率將大幅降低純 Bi 及共晶 Bi-Ag 的
延性，將 Ag 含量提高至 11wt%時，初晶 Ag
能有效阻擋裂縫傳播、減緩應力集中，因而延
伸率獲得明顯改善[4]。考慮到高溫銲點於 2nd 
level 迴銲時，環境溫度上升並超過 200oC，因
此本研究研究重點在於探討過共晶Bi-Ag合金

現象漸趨明顯，觀察其破斷面亦可發現酒窩狀
(dimple)塑性變形特徵顯著(圖3(b)、(c)、(d))，
根據上述塑性變形之特徵可與隨著溫度升

解釋當溫度上升，不易形成加工硬化，因此頸

Substrate Dissolution and Shear Properties of the Joints
between Bi-Ag Alloys and Cu Substrates for High-Temperature
Soldering Applications

The present study investigated interfacial reactions between Cu substrates
and Bi-Ag alloys during soldering. Without forming intermetallic compounds
(IMCs), the molten solder grooved and further penetrated along the grain
boundaries (GBs) of the Cu substrate. An increase in Ag content enhanced GB
grooving, raised the dissolution rate and also the amount of dissolved Cu in
molten Bi. A stoichiometric Cu-Bi phase formed isothermally in liquid solders
and considerably affected the Cu dissolution kinetics. The results also show
that Bi-Ag/Cu joints possessed a better shear strength than the Pb-Sn/Cu,
which implies that mechanical bonding by grain-boundary grooves was strong
enough to withstand shear deformation.
Key words: High-temperature Pb-free solders, Bi-Ag, substrate dissolution,
shear strength
INTRODUCTION
Due to environmental concerns, the use of Pb will
soon be banned in the electronic packaging indus-
try. Hence the search for lead-free solders has re-
cently become an important issue. The Pb-free
replacement solders for eutectic Sn-Pb, such as Sn-
Ag-Cu and Sn-Zn, have been well studied. However,
the development of high-temperature Pb-free sol-
ders to replace conventional high-Pb alloys, for
example Pb-3–5Sn, is still in its infancy. A high-Pb
solder should have a solidus higher than 260C, so
that the solder is capable of surviving secondary
reflow at 250C. The liquidus also needs to be lower
than 400C due to the limitation of the glass-tran-
sition temperature of the polymeric substrate.1
Among the proposed alloy systems, their proper
eutectic temperature of 262.5C makes the Bi-Ag
alloys with a eutectic composition of Bi-2.5wt.%Ag
a promising replacement.1–3 However, the develop-
ment of this solder alloy system is still ongoing,
mainly due to its inferior thermal and electrical
conductivity as well as poor workability. It has
recently been demonstrated that increasing the Ag
content of Bi-Ag to 11 wt.% promotes an increase in
thermal conductivity2 and ductility.4
Copper is the most common electronic substrate.
A recent report indicated that grooves which ap-
peared at the intersections of Cu grain boundaries
with the Bi-Ag/Cu interface were believed to provide
mechanical bonding for Bi-Ag/Cu joints.5 To gain
deeper insight into this solder system, quantitative
investigation of the interaction between the Cu
substrate and Bi-Ag alloys during soldering, as well
as the shear performance of the joints, was per-
formed in this study.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
The solder alloys used were eutectic Bi-2.5Ag and
hypereutectic Bi-11Ag. Pure Bi was also prepared
for comparison. As shown in Fig. 1, 5 g of the solder
was placed in a quartz tube with a 5 mm inner
diameter and then soaked in a salt bath at a fixed
temperature. The Cu wire specimens (annealed
99.9% pure Cu) of 1 mm in diameter were sequen-
tially degreased in NaOH solution, deoxidized in
HNO3 and dipped in a dimethylammonium chloride

shown in Fig. 6c and d. The depth of GB grooves
after 120 min reaction were measured and are listed
in Table III, which shows that either Ag additions
or an increased reaction temperature accelerate the
GB grooving of Cu by liquid Bi.
New phases resulting from the reaction of dis-
solved Cu and liquid solders are illustrated in Fig. 7.
In the case of pure Bi, Fig. 7a and b, acicular Cu-Bi
phase with the composition of 59.6at.%Cu-
40.4at.%Bi gathered with a fanlike appearance.
Interestingly, in the Ag containing solders, Fig. 7c
and d, the Cu-Bi phase exhibited a round appearance
and contained a certain amount of Ag (the composi-

DISCUSSION
Based on the binary Bi-Cu phase diagram,6 the
theoretical solubility of Cu in liquid Bi was esti-
mated to be about 0.28 wt.% at 350C, 0.41 wt.% at
380C and 0.6 wt.% at 410C. However, the above
results show that the amounts of dissolved Cu in
both pure Bi and Bi-Ag liquids at these tempera-
tures were much higher. According to Dybkov
analysis of the kinetics of dissolution of a solid in a
liquid,7 the dissolution of substrate into the solder
liquid can be expressed as
dc
dt
¼ k S
V
ðcs  cÞ ð1Þ
where cs = the solubility limit of substrate element
in the liquid at the reaction temperature, c = con-
centration of the substrate, k = dissolution rate
constant, S = surface area of the substrate, and V =
volume of the liquid. When c = cs, the rate of sub-
strate atoms going into the liquid is equal to the rate
of atoms leaving the liquid for the substrate. That
brings about a termination of the dissolution
reaction because a dynamic equilibrium is held be-
tween the substrate and the liquid. However, the
dissolution data in this study show that the radii of
the substrate proceeded to reduce even when the
dissolved amount exceeded the theoretical value,
which implies that the dynamic equilibrium no
longer existed. In order to explain this unusual
behavior, the phenomena observed, including GB
grooving and the formation of Cu-Bi phase, should
be clarified.
Grain-boundary grooving and even penetration
were demonstrated to occur at Bi/Cu and Bi-Ag/Cu

produced only by precipitation from Bi supersatu-
rated with Cu in the absence of Cu nuclei. Thus we
can consider that in the isothermal liquid Bi with-
out Cu nuclei, Cu-Bi phase forms preferentially
(Fig. 12). If Cu nuclei are present, the Cu atoms will
deposit on them to form the stable phase, Cu, in
preference to forming the Cu-Bi compound. The
Cu-Bi phase still deserves to pay attention, since it
significantly influences the Cu substrate dissolution
process and furthermore, it will remain and grow in
the structure after high temperature storage at
150C instead of decomposition.11 However, very
little is know about this phase at this juncture and
further comment will be reserved until additional
investigations are completed.
In the case of Cu dissolved in liquid Bi-Ag, it was
found that a small portion of Cu was substituted by
Ag and the shape of Cu-Bi phase became round.
Most importantly, the amount of the Ag containing
Cu-Bi precipitates was larger than for Cu-Bi in
liquid Bi. Therefore, it can be inferred that Ag
enhanced the formation of Cu-Bi, resulting in a
reduced Cu concentration in liquid, which may have
been responsible for the greater quantity and speed
