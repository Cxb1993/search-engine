and to simplify the equation, the following assumptions 
are applied throughout the remainder of this paper. 
 
Assumption 2.1: For the nominal part of the nonlinear 
system displayed in (1), the matrices ( ),A B  form a 
completely controllable pair. 
 
Assumption 2.2: There exist known non-negative 
constants 1k  and 2k , such that

Generally speaking, sliding mode control design is a 
two-step process. Firstly, to choose a suitable switching 
surface for the nonlinear system with a backlash and 
sector nonlinearities input, so that the original system on 
the switching surface has the desired characteristics. 
Following that, we have to determine a discontinuous 
switching control law, which forces the trajectories of the 
system to approach and stay on the sliding surface. First, 
the switching surface is defined as 
( ) ( ) 0S t Cx t= =        (9) 
where 1 2[    ]
T
mS s s s= L  is a vector of switching 
surfaces and 1 2[    ]
T
mC c c c= L  is a specified constant 
matrix such that det( ) 0CB ≠ . The system dynamics are 
driven to the sliding surfaces to generate the desired 
responses. Once the sliding mode 0)( =tS  is obtained, 
it is always accompanied with the condition of ( ) 0S t =&  
to approach the equilibrium state. Consequently, the 
characteristics of the sliding mode system with nonlinear 
input can be observed by inserting the equation (1) into 
the derivative of equation (9), or ( ) 0S t =& . 
Hence, the equivalent control eqΦ  in the sliding 
mode ( ) 0S t =  is provided by 
1( ) ( ( ) ( ) )eq d dCB C Ax t A x t Bdτ−Φ = − + − +   (10) 
Then equation (10) is put into the nonlinear equation (1) 
to generate the equivalent dynamic system with 
multi-input containing a backlash. The equivalent 
dynamic system can be expressed as 
1( ) [ ( ) ] [ ( ) ( )].d dx t I B CB C Ax t A x t τ−= − ⋅ + −&   (11) 
where I  is an identity matrix. From the above 
discussion, it can be shown that the system with multiple 
nonlinear inputs has the same features as those with linear 
input in the sliding mode. Consequently, the sliding mode 
controller in a nonlinear system with multiple nonlinear 
inputs can be designed through the same process for the 
system with linear input in the sliding mode. 
 
2.2 Adaptive Sliding Mode Control Design 
Presently, we have introduced how to design an 
adaptive sliding mode controller to deal with a nonlinear 
system with multiple backlash input. We need not to 
know the bounds of uncertainty and disturbance in 
advance by applying the adaptive sliding mode control.  
Now, the controller design problem is to choose an 
appropriate control law, [ ]1 2       Tmu u u u= L , such that 
the system trajectories asymptotically converge to the 
sliding mode (9). Let 1 2[    ]

we reconsider the nonlinear system (1) with multi-input 
containing a backlash that satisfies Assumption 2.1 and

In conclusion, we would find that the both proposed 
controllers work well for the same uncertain nonlinear 
system with multiple input containing a backlash. 
Moreover, the system performance is also satisfied 
despite the controlled system with or without 
nonlinearities in the input. Most importantly, the bounds 
of uncertainties and disturbance are not required in the 
adaptive sliding mode controller. Because it is difficult to 
measure the bounds of interconnections and disturbance 
in practical systems, the adaptive sliding mode controller 
is very helpful for us to put into the real systems. 
The computer simulation for this uncertain nonlinear 
system is shown as follows. We use two types of 
nonlinear input functions, those which only containing a 
backlash, and those including both sector nonlinearities 
and a backlash as Fig. 1. Besides, two controllers, which 
are sliding mode controller and adaptive sliding mode 
controller, are also utilized in the same uncertain 
nonlinear system. Under the original sliding mode 
controller, Fig. 2 shows the transient responses of 1x , 
2x , and 3x  of the system. Fig. 4 and Fig. 6 represent 
the sliding mode control laws 1u  and 2u  respectively. 
Fig. 8 and Fig. 10 are the state trajectories of the system. 
On the other hand, under the proposed adaptive sliding 
mode controller, Fig. 3 describes the sliding mode 
dynamics of the system. Fig. 5 and Fig. 7 delineate the 
sliding mode control laws 1u  and 2u  respectively. 
Finally, Fig. 9 and Fig. 11 are the state trajectories of the 
system. 
IV. Conclusions 
An adaptive sliding mode controller is proposed in 
this report for stabilizing uncertain nonlinear systems 
with inputs containing sector nonlinearities and backlash. 
The benefit of the adaptive sliding mode control is that 
the targets of controlled systems can be achieved without 
knowing the bounds of the uncertainty and perturbation in 
advance. Besides, the sliding mode controller can be 
applied to control systems by using either non-adaptive or 
adaptive control. From the simulation, the presented 
sliding mode controllers can drive the trajectories of the 
uncertain systems with backlash onto the sliding surfaces. 
In the future, improving the chattering effect, optimizing 
design parameters, and developing the decentralized 
controller for large-scaled systems will be interesting.
