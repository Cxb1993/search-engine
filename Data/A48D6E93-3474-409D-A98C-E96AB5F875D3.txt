characteristics, whereas the device with the lowest coverage 
ratio exhibits the poorest. However, J-V curves are 
deteriorated as the OSC devices with rib surface textures. 
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of these devices 
and the corresponding performance parameters are listed in 
table 1. The power efficiency is 0.43%, 0.01%, 0.09%, 
0.02% and 0.12% for devices with 0%, 12.6%, 19.6%, 
25.6% and 34.9% rib textures, respectively. The main 
performance parameters causing the differences in power 
efficiency between devices with and without rib surface 
textures are the short circuit current (Jsc) and the fill factor 
(FF). This indicates that OSC devices with rib surface 
textures possess higher series electrical resistance and lower 
parallel electrical resistance. 
Due to that this is the surface texture of this kind being 
fabricated there are many things to be optimized, for 
instance, the lowering of contact resistance at ITO/organic 
and organic/metal interfaces, the uniformity of surface 
profile of organics on the ribs and the stability of thickness 
control of organic layers. Indeed, observations from 
secondary electron microscope imaging of the device cross-
section suggest that the conformity of the coated layers on 
the ribs needs to be improved. Moreover, the ITO on top of 
the rib can not be annealed at high temperatures because of 
the rib material. This renders a higher ITO sheet electrical 
resistance and lowers Jsc of the device as a consequence. 
Table 1 also lists the optical transmittance of the ITO 
glass with rib surface textures. Comparing with no rib 
texture substrate, the optical transmittance of the ITO glass 
largely decreases from 88% to 67% for substrate with rib 
textures of 34.9% coverage ratio. This means only 24% of 
light is absorbed by the material of rib. This is another 
reason why the current density is decreased with the 
presence of rib surface textures. However, it is important to 
see that the Jsc is higher for devices with higher rib 
coverage ratio although they have lower optical 
transmittance. The improved Jsc is believed due to the 
increase of light trapping in absorbers along the rib wall.

4. Summary
This work proposed a novel rib surface texture scheme 
on transparent conductive film expecting to enhance the 
light trapping for a PCPDTBT:PCBM based organic solar 
cell. Results showed that OSC devices with rib surface 
textures performed improved J-V characteristics when the 
rib coverage ratio is higher. This is believed due to the 
increase of light trapping in absorbers along the rib wall. 
However, the OSC devices with rib surface textures exhibit 
deteriorated power conversion efficiency comparing with 
the device surface without textures. Observation from 
cross-section of the device structure suggests that the 
improvement on the interfacial contact resistances and the 
surface profiles of the coated layer on the ribs to enhance Jsc
and FF is necessary.

to serve as an anode. The ITO surface was treated with oxygen 
plasma to yield hydrobolic surface. It is noted that this ITO 
layer may not be coated due to the device failure as to be 
described later. A PEDOT:PSS buffer layer of 40 nm was then 
spin coated on the ITO anode. This was followed by the 
coating of Poly[2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl[4,4-bis(2-
ethylhexyl)-4H -cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b'] dithiophene-2,6-diyl]]
and poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid 
methyl-ester mixed solution (PCPDTBT:PCBM) using a spin 
coater to form the absorber layer of 150 nm. The organic 
absorber was annealed in vacuum at 150 oC for 30 min. The 
device was completed by electron-beam thermal evaporating 
lithium fluoride (LiF) and aluminum (Al) layers to serve as a 
cathode (150 nm). The structure of the OSC device is 
schematically shown in Fig. 2. The OSC active area is 0.1 cm2.

surface textures 
C. Characterization of  Rib Surface Structures and OSCs 
The surface morphology and optical transmittance of the 
rib-type surface textures were examined by a scanning 
electron microscope (SEM) and an UV-IR spectrometer, 
respectively. The I-V characterization of OSC devices were 
performed using an AM1.5 solar simulator.  
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
Followings describe first the surface morphology of the rib 
textures and optical performances of ITO substrates with the 
rib textures. The states of the rib surface textures in relationship 
with the performances of OSCs are then discussed. 
A. Sureface Morphology of Rib Surface Texture 
As can be seen in Fig. 2, the rib-type surface textures can 
offer walls nearly perpendicular to the substrate, allowing 
incident light to travel in the organic absorbers for a longer 
distance. The rib-type surface structure can also yield large 
surface area for organic absorbers to sit. Therefore, the organic 
absorbers can receive more light in unit area and light 
absorption enhancement is expected. Fig. 3 shows the SEM 
images of the rib surface textures with area coverage of 12.6% 
and 19.6%. The height of the rib is about 4 um. Indeed, the rib 
can provide additional area on the tapers for organic absorbers 
to coat on. We calculated the rib surface area is 42%, 66%, 
65% and 90% of the original area, which give 27.4%, 46.4%, 
39.4% and 55.1% more area compared to a non-textured 
surface. 
Fig. 3 SEM images of the rib-type surface textures with 
coverage ratio of (a) 12.6% and (b) 19.6%. 
B. Optical Properties of Rib Surface Texture 
The optical transmittance in dependent of coverage ratio of 
the rib texture is shown in Fig. 4. It clearly reveals that the 
optical transmittance (380 nm - 800 nm averaged) of the ITO 
substrate linearly decreases with the coverage ratio of the rib 
texture. The optical transmittance without rib textures is 88% 
and dramatically drops to 45% with rib textures of 34.9% 
coverage ratio. Such a large drop in optical transmittance 
obviously is attributed to the optical property of the photo-
resist used. The optical transmittance of the photo-resist is only 
20.7% at a thickness of ~ 4 um.

substrates in 380-800 nm with various rib coverage ratios. 
C. Characteristics of OSCs with Rib Surface Textures 
In this study, it was observed that organic solution flew to 
the valley area between ribs in the course of spin coating, 
leaving little organics on the top corner of the ribs after 
annealing. This easily caused the second ITO layer to 
electrically short with the Al cathode. No J-V characteristics 
were measured as the result. Hence, the OSCs with proper J-V 
characteristics were only fabricated on the substrate with 
single layer ITO anode. The current density-voltage (J-V)

一、參加會議經過 
國際資訊顯示研討會(IMID)過去的議程安排都以顯示技術為主，為擴大參與，近幾年也開始溶入有
機太陽能電池的主題。本次的會議共四天，共有來自於 21 個國家 420 篇的論文發表，本研究的論
文發表被安排在 08/30(四)下午 poster 時段，在發表的過程當中，與德國、日本、台灣、巴基斯坦
的業界專家或學者進行技術相關的說明與討論，其他的會議時間則安排聆聽有機太陽能電池議程
或其它有機光電元件的議程論文發表，同時參觀同地點舉行的 LED 與太陽能展。 
二、與會心得 
本次會議得到近期 OSC 發展相關的資訊，口頭論文報告共 10 場次，poster 論文發表共 26 篇，大
多討論高效率材料的發展與軟性 OSC 技術的發展，在光補穫的研究方面相對並沒有太多發表，顯
示現階段在高效率 OSC 技術發展上，仍以化工材料的開發為主要方向，而要推展軟性 OSC，則在
solution processable 的技術上需要更多的研發能量。
