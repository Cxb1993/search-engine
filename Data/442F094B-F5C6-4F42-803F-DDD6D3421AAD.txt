ABSTRACT 
 In the field of engineering application, anisotropic laminated shells have long been used in 
industries, such as pressure vessel, exterior structural shells of boat, rocket and missile, 
because they possess features of geometry and structure merits. The properties of this kind of 
structure are more complicated than those of plate. In the relative research papers, in the field, 
most of the references are focused on the study of the problems of circular cylindrical shells. 
But in practical application, the geometrical shape of elliptical cylindrical shell is better than 
circular one. For instance, for the purpose of aerodynamics, the shape of cylindrical shells with 
changing radius of curvature is better for the airframe of a fighter. In fact, it is more difficult to 
analyze the mechanical behavior of an elliptical cylindrical shell than a circular cylindrical shell. 
That stimulates us to propose a project of analyzing the responses of deformation and stress 
field of a anisotropic laminated shell with Non-rotational Symmetrical Shapes and Arbitrary 
Boundaries theoretically subjected to various loadings. Furthermore, we try to find an optimal 
method for design purpose. 
 
 Our work may be divided into two stages. First, the main effort is focused on the 
theoretical derivation and formulation. The variation of strain energy is adopted to yield the 
equilibrium equations of laminated anisotropic shell. Additionally, in analytical computation we 
use Chebyshev polynomials approaching the exact solution without traditional double Fourier 
series instead, since double Fourier series method is limited to solve the problems of 
complicated geometry, material properties and boundary conditions effectively. However, the 
method of Chebyshev polynomials paves a better way that can handle such problems easily. 
Second, we adopt the finite element method incorporated with the software of NASTRAN to 
achieve the approximate solution numerically and verify the result obtained theoretically. 
Keywords: anisotropic, shell, theoretical analysis, Chebyshev polynomials, numerical analysis, 
finite element method..

CHEBYSHEV POLYNOMINALS 
The Chebyhsev polynominal is named after Russian mathematician P. F. Chebyhsev 
(1921-1894). Chebyshev polynomials are known as a kind of orthogonal polynomials that can 
be applied to numerical analysis. For solving systems of partial differential equations in this 
paper, some basic formulae are listed as follows. 
The nth order Chebyshev polynomial [6] is expressed as  
( ) ( )qnxTn cos= , ( )qcos=x , 11 ££- x ,      (1) 
where n is a non-negative integer. By the trigonometric relation, we have  
( )( ) ( )( ) ( )qqq nnn cos21cos1cos =-++ ,      (2) 
and the recurrence equations can be generated as 
( ) ( ) ( )xTxxTxT nnn 11 2 -+ -= , ( ) 10 =xT , ( ) xxT =1 .   (3) 
In the appreciation of Chebyshev polynomials in the most engineering problems, any 
range bya ££  can be transformed into the Chebyshev polynomials’ range 11 ££- x . The 
independent variable x in Eqns. (1)-(9) can be replaced by

FORMULATION FOR LAMINATED ANISOTROPIC PLATE 
The strain-displacement relations and equilibrium equations to shell problems can be obtained 
by the method cited in Ref. [7]. 
Therefore, the strain-displacement relations in a thin elastic shell [7] are given by
