2ABSTRACT
Incorporation of nano-filler into polyolefin structure has
been widely used in current packaging development for better
performance, such greater barrier and mechanical properties.
The objectives of this study focused on the preparation and
characterization of nanocomposite made of PLA and chitosan
nanoparticles. Intact chitosan particles were sized at 5-10 μm, 
and may be reduced to nano scale by homogenizer; however,
chitosan particles clustered to micrometers after standstill for hrs.
Use of TWEEN 80 in the acidic chitosan solution retained the
particles ranging 29~81 nm (avg. 56 nm) after nanorization.
Addition of chitosan to PLA led to the surface structure of the
nanocomposite film more inseparable determined by the Atomic
Force Microscope. Glass transition temperatures (Tg) of the
nanocromposite films were from 57.8oC rising to 149.2oC in the
presence of 0.4% chitosan. The addition of chitosan also
modified the mechanical properties of nanocomposite films, that
the tensile strength significant decreased with 0.4% chitosan
added, and the tensile strength dropped from 268.76 MPa to
204.58 MPa. Moreover, the tensile strength of PLA/chitosan
was still greater than PLA/clay composite films. On the other
hand, high negative correlation between tensile strength and
elongation was observed. Conclusively, incorporation of
chitosan nanoparticles into PLA microstructure is beneficial to
greater crystallinity and thermal stability, more studies for
optimal composition to sustain the mechanical properties are
needed.

INTRODUCTION
Polymeric materials are widely used in our life, and most
of those products (including packaging films) are petroleum
base. Synthetic polymers are stable, and degrade slowly in the
nature, that leads to an environment concern. Biodegradable
materials are getting more and more attention, due to their
environment friendly origins. In biodegradable materials,
polylactic acid are of great importance, even compared to
natural degradable aliphatic polymers. Polylactic acid is derived
from fermentation of starch (such as corn starch) (Gupta and
Kumar 2004). This material has many advantages, such as raw
renewable ingredients, 65% fuel reduction to petroleum in
manufacture, and biodegradable. Polylactic acid undergoes
composting at 58oC and 60%RH for 30 days (Ray and others
2003). Polylactic acid material has been used in food packaging
application on blow-mold container, tray, clamshell package,
and diaxial extended film (Wan and others 2006). However, the
gas barrier property of polylactic acid is poor, that its oxygen
permeability is 2.5 times than PET. Additionally, polylactic acid
in nature is hard and brittle, this can be modified by adding
fillers for better mechanical properties and shorter
biodegradation time. Also, in addition of ntibacterial substances
leads to make polylactic acid an antibacterial package material,
and generate a wider range of applications (Jang and others
2007).
Except polylactic acid, chitosan is also very important in
natural polymer, which is the second abundant biopolymer next
to cellulose. Chitosan is a biopolymer made of
2-acetamino-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose and
2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose linked byβ-1,4 bond. It
consists amino groups and hydroxyl groups on its backbone, and
is generally obtained by alkaline deacetylation of chitin. Chitin
content is very high in nature, from fungal cell walls insect shell,
but mainly comes from a crustacean shells. Because chitosan
comes from nature, is characterized with nature and non-toxic.
In recent years, chitosan has been widely used in pharmaceutical
or biomedical (Wan and others 2007).
Nano-scale means the substance size between 1~100 nm,
this generally needs a special instrument to observe, such as the
Electron Microscopy and the Atomic Force Microscopy. The
current trends in nanotechnology focus on the use of
nano-particles in foods, nano-biosensors, separation technology,
nano-filtration, nano-capsules and so on (Del Nobile and others
2004; Ivan and Branka 2004; Tjong and Chen 2004). Use of
nano materials in food packaging is beneficial to improvement
of barrier, incorporation of active compounds, as well as sensing
components or signal transduction (Brody 2007; Brody and
others 2008）。 Nano-composite materials are relatively new
compounds developed for many applications, such as food
packaging system. The materials are mainly containing at least
one ingredient in nano range in their matrixes, with the
nano-particles in packaging materials demonstrates better
stability and gas barrier. Typical process for nano-composite
materials is adding 2~8% of the nano-filler in the prime
structure, in fact, it is difficult to form intercalated or exfoliated
structure if more than 8% in presence (Ray and others 2006).
With the decreasing size of dispersed phase particles,
mixed-effects are better mixtures of interface which is also with
the increase in force. Those nano-composite materials include
Sol-gel, Intercalation type, Entrapment type and Electroceramic
(Ding and others 2009).
Previous study indicated that packaging films impregnated
with nano-filler show greater crystallinity and compact
structure, and lead to stronger properties (Wichmann and
others 2008). Therefore, the present project aimed to
investigate the effectt of nano chitosan filler on the polylactic
acid nanocomposite material. Since addition of chitosan
decreases the gas permeability of PLA film (Despond and
others 2001), also reduces its hydrophobicity and enhances the
mechanical properties (Wan and the others 2006). Moreover,
4(2) SEM
SEM has been widely used to monitor the material surface
structure, its resolution via electron amplification may reach
10~25 nm (Goldstein and others 1992; Kongdee and others
2005). Nanocompsoite films were cut into 2 x 1 cm2, and then
mounted on stainless steel stubs using carbon conductive tabs.
Sample stubs were sputtered with gold particles under vacuum
in a sputter coater, and the sputtering process was processed for
40 sec at 20 mV, following transferred to SEM sample chamber.
(3) AFM
Use of SEM to observe the surface morphology of
polymeric film is limited, due to high energy electron beam may
damage the material. Therefore, AFM was taken into account to
study the surface structure of PLA-chitosan nanocomposite film.
Nanocomposite film was cut into 2 x 1 cm2, and a Tapping
mode was carried out using a multi-mode AFM (D3100, Vecco
Metrology Group, Digital Instruments, USA) Digital Instrument,
D3100 multi-mode, Tonawanda, New York, USA
equipped with a Si3N4 cantilevered scanner with the ability to
scan a 5μm × 5μm area (horizontal plane), with a 1μm vertical
range, and a scan speed of 2.014 Hz. The scanner was adjusted
to select and capture smaller images within the region accessible
for scanning. The scanner used had a 0.1 nm optimal vertical
resolution and a 1–2 nm optimal horizontal resolution for
display. Before imaging each sample, the integrity of the
AFM tip was verified by imaging a reference standard with
a known roughness of 5–7 nm.
3. Determination of physical properties
(1) FT-IR
Microstructure of PLA and PLA/chitosan nanocomposite
was determined by Polarizing Optical Microscopy (POM, Nikon
Microphot-FXA, Japan). Additionally, the identification of
PLA/chitosan nanocomposite was also accomplished by Fourier
Transform Infrared Spectrum (FT-IR, FT-730, Horiba, Tokyo)
(Bureau and others 2009). Wave number of 400-4000 cm-1 was
used to scan the material, and a target wavenumber at
2100-2300 cm–1 for–N-C=O in chitosan was analyzed. Films
were cut into 3 x 3 cm2, and mounted in the FT-IR, analysis was
taken 2 sec/scan and 32 scans.
(2) DSC
Glass transition temperature (Tg) and melting temperature
(Tm) of PLA/chitosan nanocomposite was measured by
Differential Scanning Calorimeter (Wan 2006), and the
conditions used in thermal properties were temperature
programmed 30~250 oC at a heating rate of 10 oC/min in a
nitrogen atmosphere.
(3) Mechanical properties
Effect of nano chitosan impregnated into PLA on the
mechanical properties was determined RHEO METER
(NMR-2002T, Fudoh Kogyo Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.）.
Nanocomposite films were cut into 10 x 3 cm2 (L x W), and 2
cm margin on both top and bottom were set for clamp holder. A
0.5 cm notch was made at the center of specimen, followed by
mounting the specimen on the holder. A 10kg sensor was loaded
and moving rate was set at 50 mm/min for mechanical
properties.

RESULTS
1. Particle size distribution of chitosan in suspension
The particle sizes of intact chitosan in aqueous system were
ranging between 5~10 μm (averaged > 6μm) determined by
DLS (Fig. 1), and thisresult didn’t fit the requirement of this 
study. The chitosan particle size distribution was reduced to
average 56 nm after high pressure homogenization (Fig. 2).
However, particle underwent aggregation to 421~1333 nm after
standstill for 1 h (Fig. 3). To maintain the nano size, therefore, a
stabilizer-Tween 80 was used in the preparation to avoid
chitosan coagulate and resulted the particle size between 10~42
nm (averaged 34.48 ± 10.58 nm) (Fig. 4-6), the resulting
chiosan nanoparticles were then used for subsequent studies.
Figure 1. Particle distribution of chitosan in aqueous solution
determined by DLS.
6pores and shallower holes on the surface of composite film
were observed (Fig. 9), which could be due to the nanochitosan
occupied the space. As the greater nanochitosan added (1.0 %),
no pores were observed on the composite surface, also many
papillae (50–100 nm height) were observed, possibly were
derived from aggregation of nanochitosan (Sorrentino and
others 2007). The present results indicated the nanochitosan
fillers decreased the pores on the surface of nanocomposite
film, and resulted to better barrier properties.

8significant increase in tensile was found; however, greater
particle size of filler lead to lesser elongation yield (Table 1).
The addition of nanochitosan also caused an increase in young’s
modulus, which indicated the presence of nanochitosan resulted
a stronger composite film compared to PLA alone. The study
also investigated the effect of chitosan on the mechanical
properties of composite film, and results showed the inclusion of
nanochitosan strengthened the material. No significant
difference in tensile strength and elongation yield was found in
the presence of 0.2 and 0.4% nanochitosan (< 100 nm with
Tween-80), respectively (Table 2). Thus, the optimal
nanochitosan could be ca. 0.4%.

5. Effect of filler on mechanical properties of nanocomposite
film
With the filler inside the PLA structure, the tensile strength
decreased after certain amount. Nano silverwire and clay caused
a significant decrease in tensile strength as the 0.1% added,
however, 0.4% for nanochitosan (Table 3). No significant
difference in tensile strength between nanochitosan and nano
silverwire composites was found as 1% filler added, and both
still showed greater tensile strength to PLA-clay composite
(Table 3). Similar effect of filler was found for elongation yield,
where no significant difference among comsposite filmes was
found with 0.5% fillers, however, least elongation yield was
found from PLA-clay at 1% filler level (Table 4). The present
results could be due to the non-nano nature of clay filler.
