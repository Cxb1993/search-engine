（二） 計畫英文摘要 
This proposal “Photonic crystal light sources in all-optical integrated circuits” is the first 
sub-project of the project “Toward all-optical photonic crystal nano-integrated-circuit: 
development of key components ” for 3 years, we propose to develop the photonic crystal light 
sources for the all-optical nano-integrated-circuits. For the first year, using our experience on 
photonic crystal surface emitting lasers on GaAs and GaN, we will develop the photonic crystal 
surface emitting lasers on Ge quantum dots in silicon substrates. We will also study the 
directional emission phenomena from photonic crystal waveguides via simulation. This will help 
to enhance the coupling from the light sources to photonic crystal waveguides. For the second 
year, we propose to fabricate and measure the edge-emitting photonic crystal lasers according to 
the design results of the first-year. We will also study the emission dynamic of Ge quantum dots. 
This will help to enhance the emission efficiency of the photonic crystal laser. For the third year, 
we will measure the optical gain and try to enhance the emission efficiency of the photonic 
crystal lasers. 
This sub-project will support to fabricate and measure the photonic crystal waveguides 
designed by the second sub-project. The purpose is to obtain the best coupling between the 
photonic crystal light sources and waveguides. 
 
Keywords: photonic crystals, lasers, waveguides, light sources

在量測方面，我們使用 850nm 雷射二極體 (Laser diode)經過光纖偏振器 (fiber 
polarization controller)來調整入射光的 TE模態或 TM模態再經過 5μm之 single mode fiber
以 butt coupling 的方式將光耦合入中空波導，接收端則是 50μm 之 multi-mode fiber 以 butt 
coupling 的方式以 fiber 將光收回進入 power meter。 
 
三、結果與討論 
在 ODR 膜堆中，SiO2 及 a-Si 二種材料在光波長為 850nm 波段為 n1=3.677-0.0075i
及 n2=1.53744 的折射率之膜層厚度 d1 及 d2 是以四分之一波長來決定(λ0/4n)，其厚度 d1/d2
分別為 58nm/138nm，其中我們忽略 850nm 在 a-Si 的吸收。圖二是以色散關係所計算出
週期性排列之二氧化矽(silicon dioxide, SiO2)及非晶向矽(amorphous silicon, a-Si)之能帶
結構圖。圖二中的虛線為 850nm 波段下之均一化頻率線，我們可以看出此一結構在波長
為 850nm 下有全方向的光子能隙，也就是全方向反射特性。 
 
    接下來，我們可以利用傳遞矩陣法計算出垂直入射膜堆的反射率與膜層對數關係，
如圖三所示。透過圖三，我們可以知道在我們的膜堆設計是(n1n2)N|n1|substrate 下，當膜
層對數為六對時，能夠達成高反射鏡。

從圖八的模擬結果看來，SiO2/Si 結構的轉角損耗小於 0.3dB，轉角損耗隨著角度
上面的變化並沒有很大。TM 模態在小角度彎角(θ)時會有較差的結果，是因為對應到
的入射角度為大角度(π/2-θ)，從圖九發現在大角度入射時其反射率相對較低，例如彎
角為 5 度時，入射角度為 85 度，反射率約為 97.5%，是模層結構反射率的最低點，
因此 5 度彎角時 TM 模態的轉角損耗最大。

本研究的製程流程如圖十所示。先將矽晶圓(Si wafer)利用丙酮(acetone)、異丙醇
(isopropyl alcohol, IPA)、去離子水(deionize water, DI water)清洗，烤乾後將 AZ4620
正光阻塗佈(spin coating)上矽晶圓。利用曝光顯影的技術定義 pattern 後，使用感應耦
合電漿蝕刻機蝕刻出 50μm 深的溝槽，最後將光阻清洗乾淨。 
將蝕刻出的 pattern 藉由電漿輔助化學氣相沉積系統沉積多層膜結構，再來同前
段製程，將 SU8 負光阻塗佈在多層膜結構上，再利用曝光顯影定義出 pattern，最後
再利用一次電漿輔助化學氣相沉積系統沉積上層的多層膜結構。 
考慮到波導結構上的穩定性，因此必須沉積一層厚的覆蓋層(cover layer)，本研
究中是沉積二氧化矽來當作覆蓋層。此時 SU8 光波導已製作完成，如圖十中的第八

截角式中空彎角波導量測結果如圖十三所示，其 TE 模態與 TM 模態的轉角損耗分
別為 3.4dB 與 8.2dB。其中，量測結果顯示在大於 40 度的彎角因轉角損耗過大，幾乎無
量測數據。量測結果與圖八之模擬結果相比後發現，模擬上 SiO2/Si 結構的光波導是預期
在小角度時有較大的轉角損耗但從量測中皆觀察不出此現象。推測原因是因為側壁膜厚
不是預期中 λ0/4n。由圖十一發現，其側壁膜厚約剩 56%。因此必須改變側壁膜厚，再利
用幾何光學的思考方式模擬彎角式中空波導(以節省模擬時間)。在這個模擬當中，可以
發現在小角度時(5 度至 40 度)，與量測結果趨勢是相同的，但彎角角度在中間的區段(40
度到 80 度)是比較不吻合的。我們推斷是因為在彎角的設計上會遇到「尖角」的問題，
因為利用幾何光學的角度思考時，會忽略掉彎角處的尖角，因此在中間區段時，剛好是
尖角影響最重要的時候，如圖十五所示，其模擬彎角為 60 度且考慮側壁薄膜時的現象，
可以發現其在尖角處(虛線圈圈)皆有漏光。另外漏光會稍稍偏折是因為當光進入不同介
質時會發生的折射現象，還有從這兩個圖中也可以證實出，TM 模態在彎角處，漏光嚴
重。

Ja-an Annie Ho, and Chien Chou
Abstract—The coupling between a dielectric waveguide and a
photonic crystal waveguide is studied theoretically and experimen-
tally. The coupling methods studied in this work include graded
photonic crystal coupler, photonic crystal taper, waveguide taper,
and parabolic mirror coupler. The properties of each coupler are
discussed and compared.
Index Terms—Integrated optics, optical couplers.
I. INTRODUCTION
P HOTONIC crystals (PCs) have outstanding ability to con-trol the behavior of electromagnetic (EM) waves, because
EM waves cannot propagate in a PC if its frequency is in the for-
bidden band gap. Introducing defects in PCs can realize many
compact optical devices [1]–[5]. Most of these devices are em-
bedded in PCs, so photonic crystal waveguides (PCWGs) may
be necessary to guide and route the EM waves in PCs from the
outside to the devices. A PCWG is a line defect in a PC [1], [2],
and EM waves can be localized around the line defect if its fre-
quency is in the forbidden band gap and the dimension of the
defect is proper. The widths of a PCWG and a dielectric wave-
guide (WG) are usually around one and several wavelengths,
respectively. This significant difference makes the low coupling
efficiency between a PCWG and a dielectric WG.
Several methods have been studied to improve the coupling
efficiency [6]–[11]. In this paper, a graded PC is used to alter the
mode of a dielectric WG to that of a PCWG leading to reduce
the coupling loss. The graded PC is a deformed PC that consists

of spatial-varying air hole array. In our previous work [12], a
graded PC had been designed to focus a collimated EM wave,
and the spot size can be around only two lattice constants. The
spot size is very close to the modal width of a single-line-defect
PCWG, which show that the graded PC is an excellent candidate
for the coupler between a dielectric WG and a PCWG. In this
paper, we study theoretically and experimentally the coupling
efficiency for several couplers including the PC taper [6]–[8],
the WG taper [9], [10] and the parabolic mirror coupler (J-cou-
pler) [11]. The design of the couplers in this work is very simple.
The radii of the air holes in the graded PC coupler are linearly
reduced from the edge column to the central column. In the PC
taper, the width of taper is reduced step by step. Equal step size
between the individual columns of the PC taper is introduced.
In the WG taper, the width of taper is linearly reduced. In the
parabolic mirror coupler, the curvature of mirror is a fraction of
the parabola. Although there are many improving methods for
the couplers, we only studied the innate properties of the cou-
plers here.
II. DEVICE STRUCTURE AND SIMULATION
A. Device Structure and Simulation Method
All of the devices were fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator
substrate. The thickness of the silicon device layer and the
insulator layer are 400 nm and 2 m, respectively. In order to
increase the coupling efficiency between the input single-mode
fiber to the dielectric WGs, the width of the dielectric WG
( ) was chosen as m. The PCWG is a
single-line defect along - direction in the PC formed by
air holes arranged in hexagonal lattice. The lattice constant
of the PC is 620 nm and the diameter ( ) of the air holes is
nm. The corresponding forbidden band gap is be-
tween nm to 2140 nm for the TE mode (electric field
parallel to the sample surface). Thus, we choose the wavelength
of the EM waves at nm and the TE polarization
which is around the center of the forbidden band gap of the PC.
The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method [13] is
adopted to study the coupling efficiency theoretically. Because
three-dimensional calculations need enormous memory and
computation time, the structure is reduced to two-dimensional
by the effective index method. The effective index of the
fundamental TE mode of the silicon layer with a thickness of
400 nm is .
The graded PC coupler consists of 25 10 air holes in rectan-
gular lattice as designed in our previous work. [12] The air-hole
diameters of the central column and the edge column of the

B. Simulation Results
The original coupling efficiency is only 5.6% if the flat input
WG ending directly connects to the PCWG. For the couplers,
the relations between the coupling efficiencies, back reflections,
coupling length and numerical aperture from FDTD calcula-
tions are shown in Fig. 5. The coupling efficiency of the graded
PC coupler is shown in Fig. 5(a). We can find that the coupling
efficiency is decreased as increasing the coupling length. The
maximum coupling efficiency is around 43% as the coupling
length is m ( ).
Fig. 5(b) shows the result of PC taper. The maximum cou-
pling efficiency of 45% is obtained as the taper length is
m ( ), and the back reflection is quite high here.
Fig. 5(c) shows the result of WG taper, we find that the cou-
pling efficiency is increased with increasing the taper length.
The maximum coupling efficiency is 71% for the taper length
of m ( ).
For the parabolic mirror coupler, the coupling efficiency is
78% in theoretical result.

III. FABRICATIONS, MEASUREMENT, AND DISCUSSION
A. Fabrications and Measurement
The devices were fabricated by deep UV photolithography
and silicon reactive ion etching techniques. Fig. 6 shows the
scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the devices. We
can find that the air holes of the PCWG are merged together be-
cause of over etching in fabrication process. The diameter of the
air holes is enlarged from nm to nm. The complete
band gap does not exist in the structure reducing the horizontal
confinement of EM waves in the PCWG and increasing the scat-
tering loss. Plane wave expansion calculations have been done
to ensure the fact that this deformed PCWG can still guide the
EM waves for the wavelength at nm. The measured
propagation loss of the PCWG is 0.095 dB m. The diameter of
the air hole in the PC taper is also enlarged leading to a signifi-
cant difference between the experimental and theoretical results
in the case of PC taper as shown in Fig. 5(b).
The 1-dB passband width was also studied for the couplers
with the highest coupling efficiency. The passband width of the
graded PC coupler and the WG taper are 7.3 and 8.6 nm, respec-
tively. For the other couplers, the results show narrower pass-
band width ( nm). The passband width could be increased
through optimization.
In measurement, butt-coupling method was adopted to couple
the light between a single mode fiber and the dielectric WGs.
The polarization was controlled to be TE polarization. In our
design, PCWGs with different length was fabricated to calcu-
late the propagation loss. (The lengths of the PCWG are around
156 m and 40 m.) The coupling loss of the couplers can be
obtained by subtracting all the loss except the coupling loss of
the coupler from total loss of the devices.
B. Measurement Results and Discussion
The experimental results are also shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5(a)
shows that the maximum coupling efficiency of the graded PC
is 37% for m ( ). For this coupling length,
this coupling efficiency is the highest for all couplers studied

this condition, the deformation of lattice could easily cause the
merging of the scatterers and reduce the ability of the confine-
ment for EM waves.
In Fig. 5, some differences can be observed between the ex-
perimental and theoretical result. We speculated that the en-
larged air holes in the PCWGs may be the cause of the difference
between the experimental and theoretical results. This phenom-
enon is especially obvious in the case of PC taper because the
PC taper is a PCWG with expanded terminal. The coupling ef-
ficiency of the PC taper with enlarged air holes was also cal-
culated, and the result is shown in Fig. 5(b). The result is more
similar to the experimental result. An unusual phenomenon can
be observed when the coupling length is around m.
The coupling efficiency of the PC taper with enlarged air holes
is higher than the original PC taper.
Finally, we conclude that the graded PC is suitable for
extremely short coupling length (high NA). For long coupling
length (low NA), the WG taper may be more suitable to couple
the EM waves into the PCWGs. For the same coupling length,
the coupling efficiency of the pure PC tapers without any
improving design is lower than that of the WG tapers in this
study. The PC tapers might need additional optimization to
increase the coupling efficiency. [6], [8] The parabolic mirror
coupler requires low roughness of the mirror surface and larger
device surface, but it can provide higher coupling efficiency
and low back reflection.
