1. 中文摘要 
 
隨著科技的進步，世界各國石油需求量逐年增加，基於石化能源儲量逐漸
減少的壓力，使得石油價格從 1990 年的每桶 30 美元漲至現在每桶 72 美元，因
此，是節各國無不積極投入新替代能源之研發，在這些替代能源中，又以被稱
為「潔淨能源」的氫氣，備受國際矚目；有鑑於此，本研究計畫結合纖維素水
解、暗醱酵(dark fermentation)產氫、光醱酵(light fermentation)產氫以及微藻
固定二氧化碳等四種不同的生物程序，試圖建構一套零二氧化碳排放之整合
型生物產氫系統。 
首先本研究從南台灣篩選出來的纖維素分解菌株經 16S rRNA 序列鑒定為
Acinetobacter junii。經由纖維素分解酵素及半纖維素分解酵素活性測試出其酵素
活性主要存在胞外。最佳誘導生產 xylanase 之培養條件為 35oC，0.3vvm 的曝氣
速率，10 g/L 的碳源濃度以及 1.0 g/L 的 peptone。此菌所生產之生物製劑比上清
液具有更佳之酵素活性其長期水解之最適溫度為 50oC。利用 Clostridium 
butyricum CGS5 當作暗醱酵產氫菌種，結果顯示氫氣產率以及氫氣產生速率分
別為 2.86 mol H2/mol sucrose 以及 250 ml/l/h；接下來直接將暗醱酵出流水稀釋
並直接導入光醱酵系統中進行光合產氫，在光醱酵中使用 Rhodopseudomonas 
palutris WP 3-5 當作菌種，操作條件為 30oC、100 W/m2 irradiation、起始 pH 7.0 以
及 96 h 的 HRT，結果顯示氫氣產生速率為 16.4 ml H2/l/h，此外，整合暗醱酵以
及光醱酵，氫氣產率將由原先的 2.87 mol H2/mol sucrose (暗醱酵) 提升至 15.5 
mol H2/mol sucrose (光/暗醱酵)；由於光/暗醱酵會產生近 45%的二氧化碳，為
了建構零二氧化碳排放之生物產氫系統，本研究將光/暗醱酵所產生的二氧化
碳直接導入培養微藻 Scenedesmus obliquu 之光生物反應器中，結果顯示，出口
端的二氧化碳濃度接近 0%，由於所產生的氫氣不含二氧化碳，因此，將大幅降

4. 研究方法 
4.1 纖維素水解菌種篩選 
本實驗室由南台灣竹林成功純化分離並篩選出纖維素水解菌株，經由 16S r RNA 基因比
對後，其菌種為：Acinetobacter junii F6-02 (圖 1)。而本研究所採用之產氫菌株為本實驗室由
高產氫速率生物反應槽中成功分離純化出之產氫菌株，經由 16S r RNA 基因比對後，其菌種
為：Clostridium butyricum CGS5 (圖 2) 
 
4.2 紫色不含硫光合菌之前培養 
將液體培養的菌種轉養至含碳源之培養液中，再將其置放於光照強度 70 W/m2 (藉由鎢絲
燈泡以提供光能)，溫度控制在 32 oC 下培養，並且利用 NaOH 將 pH 調等至 7.0 左右。待紫色
不含硫光合菌生長至足夠菌體濃度，即可供做試驗。 
 
4.3 紫色不含硫光合菌之批式試驗 
將前培養所得到之菌體溶液植入光反應器，使用太陽能光纖以及鎢絲燈當作光源，操作
溫度控制在 32oC、起始 pH 控制在 7.0，攪拌速度控制在 200 rpm，探討不同操作條件對光合
菌產氫之影響，並定時取樣觀察菌體濃度、氫氣產量、pH 以及乙酸濃度之變化情形。 
 
4.4 微藻之藻種來源 
本研究所使用的藻種是乃由南台灣海域水中篩選得到，為本土性菌種，經由初步鑑定為
Scenedesmus obliquus，屬於斜角柵藻。 
 
4.5 藻種之分離篩選步驟 
藻種之篩選步驟，首先自南台灣海域中取得樣本，在配置適合微藻生長之固態培養基，
之後將樣本均勻塗抹於固態培養基或斜面培養基上，於 30oC 的恆溫培養箱中靜置培養 7 天，
觀察固態培養基上微藻菌落的生長情況；此外，為了鑑定微藻之種類，本研究將所得到的藻
種進行純化分離的步驟，本研究中分離純化的方法採用序列稀釋(serial dilution)之方式，將篩
選到的藻種稀釋，再配製含 1% NaHCO3 之固態培養基後，再將稀釋過後的藻體均勻塗抹於固
態平板培養基上落，重複此步驟 5 次，以確定該藻種的純度，最後再以白金環取出並進行液
態培養，並經由 purity check，驗證藻種之分離結果。 
 
4.6 Scenedesmus obliquus 之液體培養基組成 
培養基組成(g/L)：Ca(NO3)2.4H2O, 1.00; KH2PO4, 0.26; MgSO4.7H2O, 0.55; KCl, 0.25;

5. 實驗結果與討論 
5.1 纖維素水解酵素定性 
由圖3結果可得知，分離純化所得的纖維素水解菌株Acinetobacter junii F6-02所生產之酵
素主要有endo-glucanase、exo-glucanase、xylanase，且酵素生產之位置主要以胞外為主，其中
酵素活性能力則是以xylanase＞endo-glucanase＞exo-glucanase，但此纖維素水解菌株所生產之
endo-glucanase，exo-glucosidase與　-glucosidase活性皆不高，因此主要著重於胞外之xylanase
酵素。

5.2 纖維素酵素生產之最適化 
BHM (Bushnell Haas medium)為xylanase酵素生產之基質配方如表1所示，首先針對不同溫
度(30-50oC)探討對生產xylanase酵素之影響，如圖4所示，隨著溫度由30oC提升至35oC，其
xylanase酵素活性也隨之上升，但當培養溫度提升至40oC以上時，酵素的生產被抑制，導致所
監測到之xylanase活性下降。因此選定培養溫度為35oC探討培養基中添加yeast extract、peptone
與tryptone對xylanase生產之影響，將其濃度分別控制在0.5 g/L、1.0 g/L與2.0 g/L進行實驗。由
圖5所示，添加這三種成分皆有助於xylanase酵素生產，其中以添加peptone最為顯著，且當控
制添加濃度為1.0 g/L時，其xylanase酵素活性可高達37.0 U/ml，因此以1.0 g/L的peptone添加量
加入BHM培養基中進行xylanase酵素的生產。將培養條件控制在上述之最佳結果進而探討不
同碳源濃度(1.0 g/L, 2.0 g/L, 5.0 g/L, 10.0 g/L, 20.0 g/L)對生產xylanase酵素之影響，由圖6所
示，當提升碳源濃度時，其生產xylanase酵素也隨之提升，其中以碳源濃度為10.0 g/L為生產
xylanase酵素的最佳濃度，xylanase酵素活性可高達40.2 U/ml。

氧氣為Acinetobacter junii F6-02生產xylanase酵素之重要因子，因而針對不同曝氣速率
(0.1vvm, 0.2vvm, 0.3vvm, 0.4vvm, 0.8vvm, 1.0vvm)探討其對生產xylanase酵素之影響。由圖7所
示，當曝氣速率為1.0vvm時，其菌體不生產xylanase酵素，但是當調降曝氣速率至0.8vvm時，

5.5 以xylanase酵素為生物製劑之穩定性測試 
利用所開發之生物製劑進行酵素穩定性測試，如圖9所示，當溫度愈高，其酵素穩定性愈
差，尤其當溫度超過55oC以上最為明顯，藉由同時評估生產還原醣與酵素穩定性兩者時，則
溫度控制為50oC為最佳條件，不僅可以增進酵素水解之速率，也可以增進酵素之長期使用性，
針對此結果有利於未來實際應用於工業化水解程序。

Modified 配方為暗-光醱酵產氫系統之配方時，氫氣產率約為 10.90 mol H2/mol sucrose，此配
方所殘餘氨氮濃度僅約 22.6 mg/L，並未能抑制光醱酵，以導致光醱酵加以利用暗醱酵所產生
之液相代謝酸進行產氫，加以提升氫氣產率，約為 Endo 配方的 6.0 倍，因此本結果顯示，
Modified 配方更加適合為暗-光醱酵產氫系統之配方。 
 
 
5.9 以 Modified 配方進行不同碳源對暗-光醱酵產氫之影響 
如圖 14 所示，以 Modified 配方進行不同碳源(澱粉、蔗糖、葡萄糖、果糖與木糖)對暗-
光醱酵系統之氫氣產率影響。結果顯示，當蔗糖為碳源時，有最高氫氣產率，其可達 10.90 mol 
H2/mol sucrose，但本暗醱酵菌株可以直接轉換澱粉產氫，其氫氣產率雖僅有 23.71 mmol H2/g 
starch，由圖 15 所示，其當碳源為蔗渣時，仍有最高產氫速率，其可達 278.61 ml/h/l，其次為
澱粉為碳源，其餘皆有不錯之產氫速率。

5.12 以暗-光連續流系統併結合微藻系統進行零 CO2排放之探討 
如圖 21 所示，利用暗與光醱酵產氫系統中，CO2 仍為產物之一，進而串接微藻系統進行
CO2 固定。結果顯示，以暗醱酵系統而言，系統水力停留時間(HRT)約為 12 h，CO2 濃度約為
40%，其產 CO2 速率約為 50 ml/h/l，以光醱酵系統而言，系統水力停留時間(HRT)約為 96 h，
CO2 濃度約為 7%，其產 CO2 速率約為 0.5 ml/h/l，藉由暗-光醱酵系統所產生之 CO2 直接以微
藻系統串接，實驗結果得知此微藻系統中 CO2 濃度與 CO2 流速皆約為 0%與 0 ml/h/l。此結果
顯示，此系統微藻可以有效將暗-光醱酵產氫系統中之 CO2 產物完全利用，以至於建構一套零
CO2 排放高氫氣產率之生物產氫系統。 
 
6. 結論 
所篩選的Acinetobacter junii F6-02有水解xylan的能力，且所生產的酵素主要胞外為主。最
佳生產xylanase酵素條件為溫度控制為35oC，微養條件比厭氧條件好，最佳的碳源添加濃度為
10 g/l，且所開發之生物製劑以50oC之下長期操作為最佳條件。利用NaOH進行其處理比其他
前處理皆還要好。藉由Clostridium butyricum CGS5進行醱酵產氫之測試，分別利用xylan水解
液與NaOH前處理後的稻桿水解液進行產氫，其最大產氫速率分別為62.5 ml/h/L, 26.8 ml/h/L，
其氫氣產率分別為0.70 mol H2/mol xylose, 0.76 mol H2/mol xylose。 
而在本研究中，從台灣南部水域中純化分離出的Scenedesmus CNW-N和Scenedesmus 
AS-6-1有非常優異的生長表現、沉降速率和二氧化碳固定能力，結果包含了比生長速率分別
可達1.019和1.065 d-1、最大藻體乾重(2.633和1.901 g/L)、平均產率( 201.4和150.7 mg L-1d)、沉
降速度(30分鐘內達到78.9%及83.3% )、平均二氧化碳固定率(22.3和15.7%)、和二氧化碳消耗
速率(390.2和290.2 mg L-1d-1)。由這些結果可以發現這兩株從台灣南部水域所篩選的本土
Scenedesmus obliquus不但具有高生長速度、高生物質量外，更具有非常好的二氧化碳固定能
力。因此，藉由系統的整合，將大幅降低系統的CO2排放量，達到零排放(zero emission)之目
標，還可生產有經濟或能源價值的藻類細胞(如健康食品，生質柴油之開發)，建立資源回收
再利用的機制以及朝著實際應用之方向努力。

Introduction 
As the petroleum price keeps rising and the global warming becomes a major 
threat to sustainability of eco-environment, the demand for reliable and effective 
energy alternatives is increasingly urgent [1].  Among the developing alterative 
energy resources, hydrogen is recognized as the most promising alternative to fossil 
fuels and is expected to play a major role in future energy supply because it is clean, 
recyclable, and efficient [2].  To achieve a “hydrogen economy”, non-polluting and 
sustainable H2 production methods need to be developed. Biological H2 production by 
using light-dependent fermentative pathways appears to be a good candidate, as it is 
environment-friendly, less energy intensive and inherits theoretically high substrate 
conversion efficiency [3-5].  In particular, hydrogen production through dark or 
photo fermentative conversion of organic substrates is of great interest due to its dual 
function of waste reduction and clean energy production [6,7], thereby acting as a 
promising option for biohydrogen production. [8-10].   
Dark fermentation with mainly acidogenic bacteria (Enterobacter, Bacillus, and 
Clostridium) are well known to produce H2 from converting various organic 
substrates (e.g., glucose and sucrose) into soluble metabolites (i.e., volatile fatty acids 
(VFAs) and alcohols) [11-14], which can be further utilized by photosynthetic bacteria 
(PSB) (such as purple nonsulfur bacteria) to produce more H2 at the expense of light 
energy [15-18]. Therefore, using anaerobic fermentative bacteria and PSB for 
sequential dark and photo fermentation has been regarded as an efficient system for 
further enhancement of the energy recovery, biological H2 production yield and total 
COD removal efficiency [19-24].  In particular, a theoretically maximum yield of 12 
mol H2 per mol hexose could be achieved with an integrated dark/photo fermentation 
system [25], while a H2 yield of 8 mol/mol glucose is considered sufficient for 
 9
collecting system and simulated sunlight illumination pattern by using halogen lamp 
as the light source.  The foregoing problems can be solved by using indoor 
photobioreactors [37], which are usually more efficient and easier to control. 
In this study, engineering strategy was applied to combine dark/photo-H2 
fermentation for enhancing the overall H2 yield.  First, the feasibility of phototrophic 
hydrogen production was explored by using dark-H2 fermentation broth with different 
dilution ratio.  Furthermore, our previous findings [37] showed that phototrophic 
hydrogen production performance is closely related with the nutrient composition in 
the medium.  Therefore, different nutrient supplement, such as yeast extract and 
glutamic acid, was added into dark-fermented broth to explore their effects on 
phototrophic hydrogen production performance.  Furthermore, based on our recent 
findings [33-35], a novel and more cost-effective illumination system, in which 
optical fibers excited by sunlight were used as the internal illumination system, was 
assessed for its effect on photo-H2 production performance. 
 
Experimental Section: 
Microorganism and medium 
The phototrophic H2 producer used in this study was Rhodopseudomonas 
palustris WP3-5, which was isolated from a swine wastewater treatment plant in 
central Taiwan [37]. The culture medium for the strain consisted of (in g/l) HAc, 2000 
(mg COD/l; COD denotes chemical oxygen demand); glutamic acid, 0.4; K2HPO4, 0.5; 
KH2PO4, 0.5; MgSO4 ·7H2O, 0.2; NaCl, 0.4; CaCl2 ·2H2O, 0.05; yeast extract, 0.2; 
iron citrate solution (1.0 g/l), 5 ml/l; trace element solution, 1 ml. The trace element 
solution contained (in mg/l) ZnCl2, 70; MnCl2·4 H2O, 100; H3BO3, 60; CoCl2 ·6 H2O, 
200; CuCl2 ·2 H2O, 20; NiCl2·6 H2O, 20; NaMoO4·2 H2O, 40; HCl (25%), 1 ml/l.  
 11
Since the SLOF did not have direct contact with the medium, there was no need to 
autoclave the optical fibers prior to use. The SLOF was made of quartz glass 
(diameter: 11 mm, length: 5 and 50 cm) obtained from Laforet Engineering Co. Ltd. 
(Tokyo, Japan). The side light optical fiber was excited by sunlight collecting system 
(Laforet Engineering Co. Ltd. Tokyo, Japan).  The sunlight was collected by using 
fresnel lenses and then transmitted through an end-light optical fiber toward side-light 
optical fibers [3,37,40,41]. The light tracking system makes each fresnel lenses 
rotated toward the position of sun so that the SLOF could gain maximum light energy 
from sunlight during the daytime.  After autoclave sterilization of the bioreactor, R. 
palustris WP3-5 cells were inoculated (10 % inoculum) into the reactor.  The batch 
photo-fermentation reactor was carried out at a light intensity of (95 W/m2) with the 
illumination of tungsten filament lamps as the external light sources. The internal light 
source was solar-energy-excited side light optical fiber (SEEOF) whose light intensity 
varied within the range of 0-350 W/m2 depending on the weather and time.  The 
initial cell concentration of R. palustris WP3-5 was 0.875 g/l.  The batch reactors 
were controlled at 32oC, pH 7.1, and an agitation rate of 200 rpm. 
A gas meter (Type TG1; Ritter Inc., Germany) was used to measure the amount 
of gas products generated and the gas volumes were calibrated to 25 oC and 760 
mmHg.  Gas samples were taken by gas syringe at desired time intervals to measure 
the gas composition.  The liquid sample was also collected from the reactor as a 
function of time to determine cell concentration, pH and residual acetate 
concentration.  For batch cultures, time-course data of cumulative H2 production 
were simulated by modified Gompertz equation (Eqn. 1) [42] to determine the kinetic 
parameters of photo-H2 production.

H2 fermentation process.  Many reports showed that the photosynthetic bacterium (R. 
palustris) could convert VFA into hydrogen with a high conversion efficiency 
[30,46,47].  Thus, in this study, different dilution ratio of dark fermentation broth 
was utilized as the substrate for photo-H2 production with R. palustris WP 3-5.  The 
halogen and tungsten filament lamps were used as the external light sources with a 
similar light intensity of ca. 95 W/m2.  The photo-H2 production performance of 
using different dilution ratio with dark-fermentation broth as substrate was shown in 
Table 1.  The dilution ratio of 1:2 appeared to result in much better cumulative H2 
production and maximum H2 production rate over those obtained from others dilution 
ratios.  Meanwhile, using dilution ratio of 1:2 also gave the highest overall H2 
production rate of 10.72 ml/l/h (Fig.2a).  Also, according to the modified Gompertz 
equation (Eqn. 1), the Rmax (representing the kinetic characteristics of H2 production) 
was higher for the dilution ratio of 1:2 (1.907 ml/h), slightly higher than 1.734 and 
1.84 ml/h obtained from the dilution ratio of 1:3 and 1:5, respectively, but much 
higher than 1.415 and 0.1883 ml/h for dilution ratio of 1:1 and original dark 
fermentation broth, respectively (Table 1).   The significantly decrease in bioH2 
production performance with lower dilution ratio or no dilution could be attributed to 
an excessive VFA concentration, resulting in inhibition to photo-H2 production.   
This possible substrate inhibition effect is consistent with reports indicating that the 
photo-H2 production was inhibited when initial substrate (VFA) concentration was 
higher than a threshold level (HAc concentration = 2250-2750 mg COD/l and HBu 
concentration = 2000-3800 mg COD/l) [11,42,48-50].  During the course of batch 
fermentation, the pH did not vary significantly as it maintained within the range of 
7.0–7.8 for the dilution ratio of 1:1, 1:3 and 1:5 (data not shown).   Nevertheless, 
higher H2 yield was obtained from a dilution ratio of 1:2.  The total hydrogen yield 
with dilution ratio of 1:2 increased from 3.80 mol H2/mol sucrose for 
 15
the diluted dark fermentation broth (dilution ratio of 1:2).  This insufficiency may be 
resolved by addition of nutrients into the diluted dark fermentation broth.  
In this work, both glutamic acid (GA) and yeast extract (YE) were used as added 
nutrient source to investigate whether the photo-H2 production performance could be 
further improved under the same total light intensity (ca. 95 W/m2), light sources 
(HL/TL) and dilution ratio (1:2).  As shown in Fig. 3, the overall H2 production rate 
and H2 yield obviously increased with addition of GA (400 mg/l) and YE (200 mg/l) 
when compared with the performance from using the original dark fermentation broth 
as substrate.  Using GA and YE resulted in similar H2 yield of 7.28 and 7.54 ml 
H2/mol sucrose, respectively (Fig. 3b).  However, addition of YE gave a higher 
overall H2 production rate (17.02 ml/l/h) than using GA (14.0 ml/l/h) (Fig. 3a).    
The highest overall H2 production rate (21.2 ml/l/h) and H2 yield (10.25 mol H2/mol 
sucrose) were obtained with adding both GA and YE together (Fig. 3).  This 
performance represents a 152% increase in cumulative H2 production, 97.8% increase 
in overall H2 production rate, and 66.9% increase in H2 yield when compared to the 
control experiments (i.e., without nitrogen source addition) (Table 2, Fig. 3).  
Moreover, the addition of both GA and YE attained the highest Rmax of 2.53 ml/h at a 
dilution ratio of 1:2, followed by 2.1 ml/h for YE culture, 2.08 ml/h for GA culture 
and 1.907 ml/h for the culture without nitrogen source addition (Table 2). The 
foregoing results seem to suggest that YE and GA are both important nutrients for 
enhancing the phototrophic hydrogen production from R. palustris WP 3-5 either by 
accelerating nitrogenase activity or by improving cell growth. 
By using the two-stage integrated dark/photo fermentation process, the total 
hydrogen yield increased from 6.14 mol H2/mol sucrose (with dilution ratio of 1:2) to 
10.25 mol H2/mol sucrose (with dilution ratio of 1:2 and addition of GA and YE).  
The high hydrogen yield not only indicates a good efficiency of converting carbon 
 17
from the integrated dark/photo fermentation process, the ammonia nitrogen 
concentration and VFA composition in the medium were monitored.  It was found 
that the residual ammonia nitrogen concentration in medium was close to 0.6 mg/l, 
which appears to be too low to inhibit photo-H2 production performance.  On the 
other hand, analysis of the residual VFA composition shows a large quantity of butyric 
acid, which accounted for nearly 90% of total soluble metabolites.  The high butyric 
acid concentration seemed to inhibit total H2 yield and total COD removal efficiency, 
as recent studies showed that the photo-H2 production performance was inhibited 
when butyric acid was in excess [30].  Meanwhile, from the aspect of electricity 
consumption, using OF(sunlight)/TL is a sustainable and economical illumination 
system for photo-H2 production. The electricity consumption by combining SEEOFP 
(day time) and TL (night time) was about 37.1% lower than using TL (whole day).  
Therefore, combining medium improvement and photobioreactor design, the bioH2 
production performance could be much improved.  In addition, to our best knowledge, 
this study appears to be the first report raising the idea of combining solar energy 
optical fiber system in integration of dark and photo fermentative H2 producing 
process.  
 
Conclusions 
This work is a successful demonstration of combining dark and photo 
fermentation for high-yield bioH2 production.  Engineering strategies including 
medium pretreatment and improvement as well as innovative photobioreactor design 
were applied for a much improvement in bioH2 production performance. Using the 
optimal medium conditions (1:2 dilution ratio for original dark fermentation broth and 
addition of dual nutrients) and the SEEOFP photobioreactor for photo-H2 
fermentation, the total hydrogen yield could be increased from 3.85 to 10.25 mol

Abstract Under the financial support from Taiwan’s Bureau of Energy and Feng 
Chia University (FCU), the FCU biohydrogen research team has successfully 
developed a high-rate hydrogen production process able to produce H2 at a maximum 
rate of 15 L/L/h. En route toward commercialization of this highly efficient hydrogen 
fermentation system, a 400 L pilot-scale system was constructed for determining 
scale-up operation parameters for commercializing the bioH2 production technology.  
The pilot-scale system was mainly composed of feedstock tank, mixing system, 
fermentor, gas/liquid separator and automatic control system. The fermentor was fed 
with sucrose (20 g COD/L) and operated at 35oC. A batch strategy was used for 
system starting-up. The fermentor was first operated on a batch mode for two days 
and was then switched to a continuous-feeding mode (HRT 12 h) for one month. 
During the continuous operation, pH notably affected H2 production efficiency and 
bacterial community. For the first 14-day operation, the H2 production rate increased 
from 0.017 to 0.256 L/L/h with a pH variation from 5.0 to 7.0. The DGGE results 
indicate the presence of two Clostridium species (namely, Clostridium butyricum and

INTRODUCTION 
Dark fermentation is the most commercially feasible biological method of H2 production due to 
its high production rate. Most hydrogen fermentation has been conducted in well-mixed systems, 
such as anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (Lin and Jo, 2005; Chin et al., 2003), continuously 
 35
The seed sludge was collected from a beach in western Taiwan and was heat-treated 
(100oC for 45 min) to inhibit the methanogenic activity. The heat-treated sludge was 
seeded into a 1 L agitated granular sludge bed reactor (AGSBR) operated at a HRT of 2 
h at 37±1oC for 2 weeks. The operation pH was controlled at 6. The acclimation 
substrate was sucrose (20 g COD/L). The substrate solution contained the following 
inorganic supplements (Endo formulation, mg/L): NH4HCO3 5240, K2HPO4 125, 
MgCl2•6H2O 100, MnSO4•6H2O 15, FeSO4•7H2O 25, CuSO4•5H2O 5, CoCl2•5H2O 
0.125, and NaHCO3 6720 (Endo et al., 1982). The hydrogen gas contents in AGSBR 
were 35-40%. 
 
Start-up strategy and hydrogen production in the fermentor 
At the beginning, 60 L of cultivated seed sludge and 300 L of substrate and nutrient solution 
were mixed in the fermentor using a batch strategy for one day to enhance the biomass 
concentration. The mixed liquid in the fermentor was first purged with argon gas for 10 min to 
ensure an anaerobic condition prior to H2 fermentation experiments. The system was then 
switched to a continuous-feeding mode (HRT 12 h) after 48 h in batch operation. 
This pilot-scale fermentor was fed on sucrose (20 g/L) and operated at 35oC. The nutrient 
solution contained the same nutrients (Endo formulation) used for the seed sludge (Endo et al., 
1982). A varied NaHCO3 concentration (2.62-5.24 g/L) was used for maintaining the pH to 6.0.  
During the experiments, the quantity and composition of gas products (mainly, CO2 and H2) and 
the soluble microbial products (SMP) were monitored at a designated time interval. The biogas 
volumes measured by a natural gas meter (provided from Shin Chung Natural gas Co. Ltd) were 
corrected to a temperature of 25oC and a pressure of 1 atm. The hydrogen yield was calculated 
based on mmol of H2 produced per gram of sucrose consumed. 
 
 
Analytical methods 
The composition of product gas was measured with a China Chromatography 8700T gas 
chromatograph (GC) equipped with a packed (packing, Porapak Q), stainless steel column and a 
thermal conductivity detector. Oven, injector, and detector temperatures were 40, 40, and 40 °C, 
respectively. Argon was used as the carrier gas. The concentrations of ethanol and organic acids 
were measured using a Shimadzu GC-14A GC equipped with a glass column (packing, FON), 
and a flame ionization detector. Oven, injector, and detector temperatures were 145, 175, and 
185°C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas (Chen et al, 2002; Lin and Chang, 
1999). Anthrone-sufuric acid method was used to measure residual sucrose concentration 
(Dubois et al., 1956).The analytical procedures of Standard Methods (APHA, 1995) were used 
 37
the bottom ORP values were lower than those of middle. During the batch operation, the pH 
was much higher than 6.0 and ORP varied from -200 mV to -400 mV with low biogas 
production. The carbohydrate concentrations decreased from 14 g/L to 2 g/L along with a 
biomass concentrations increasing from 1.0 g VSS/L to 2.7 g VSS/L. It shows that the 
pre-culture seed and the batch strategy could efficiently shorten the lag phase and enhance the 
biomass growth. 
After continuous-feeding mode (HRT 12 h) was activated, the pH was maintained at 6.0 and 
ORP ranged from -300 mV to -550 mV. Low ORP values were generally favorable to 
biohydrogen generation due probably to the accumulation of free electrons in NADH (Wan et 
al., 2006). Table 1 shows that the average sucrose degradation was 87.8±10.9% during 
unsteady-state operation (days 3-20), but was 93.5±1.4% at steady-state operation (days 21-30). 
 
Biogas production 
The start-up performance of the pilot-scale hydrogen fermentation system was evaluated in 
terms of BPR, HPR, and hydrogen yield (HY). Figure 2 depicts the variations in BPR, HPR, and 
HY. After the batch operation, the H2 content, BPR, and HPR reached 17%, 9.84 m3/m3/d, 0.46 
m3/m3/d, respectively. The BPR and HPR values ranged from 0.73-16.9 m3/m3/d and 0.42-5.22 
m3/m3/d, respectively. Table 1 shows that the average HPR values at steady-state operation 
(days 21-30, HRT 12 h) was 18 folds higher than that obtained at the batch mode (days 0-2). 
These values were similar to a HPR value of 5.57 m3/m3/d reported by Ren et al. (2006) using 
substrate molasses with a pilot-scale bioreactor system. The peak HY was 2.34 mol H2/mol 
sucrose at day 15. Similar HY results were also obtained in our pervious study (Chen et al., 
2008). The average HY values at steady-state operation (days 21-30, HRT 12 h) was 5.7 folds 
higher than that at the batch mode (days 0-2). The hydrogen content at the fed-batch mode (days 
0-2) was only 5.6%, but it increased to 10.8-35.8% at the continuous-feed mode (days 3-30). 
 
 
Productions of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and ethanol 
Hydrogen production by anaerobic degradation of organics is accompanied with production of 
soluble microbial products (SMP, = VFA + ethanol). There were three liquid sample ports on the 
fermentor. As indicated in Table 1, the average SMP concentrations were 3,102±1494, 
10,088±2,184, and 11,245±749 mg COD/L while the fermentor was at batch operation (days 
0-2), continuous operation at unsteady state (days 3-20) and continuous operation at steady state 
(days 21-30), respectively. Efficient hydrogen production is always accompanied with 
metabolites production (Chen et al., 2008). For instance, low VFA concentration of 2491±1030 
mg COD/L was obtained at the batch mode (days 0-2), while the BPR and HPR values were 
 39
operation period in the pilot fermenter. The best performance occurred when C. pastuerianum 
was the only predominant hydrogen-producing species. To maintain this preferable bacterial 
community structure, the pH values should be maintained at 5.5-6.0. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
This work demonstrated a successful start-up of a 400-L pilot-scale H2 fermentation system 
feeding on substrate sucrose. The effective start-up strategy is using acclimated seed sludge and 
a two-day batch feeding mode followed by a continuous feeding operation. The hydrogen 
production performance had peak HPR and HY values of 5.22 m3/m3/d and 2.34 mol H2/mol 
sucrose, respectively. Two Clostridium species, C. butyricum and C. pasteurianum were 
observed in the system. Stable hydrogen production rate was obtained when C. pasteurianum 
was the dominant hydrogen-producing bacterial population as the fermenter was operated at pH 
5.5-6.0.
