The Development of Grating-based Fiber Sensing System with 
Micro-Nano Sensitivity on Dynamic Displacement and Strain 
 4 
of the prototype bridge [7, 8]. They experimentally validated the analytical solution and obtained good 
agreement between experimental results and theoretical predictions. In their work, high frequency contents 
were removed by a Butterworth low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency at 30 Hz and thus time history of 
the entire transient response is not provided. Chan et al used the bridge strain responses to identify the 
axle force history of a moving vehicle on bridges [9]. They investigated effects of parameters such as the 
sampling frequencies, the mode numbers, the vehicle speeds, or the sensor numbers and locations. Since 
the type of structures, natural frequencies and damping characteristics of the structures, speed of the 
moving mass, inertia of the mass, and even paths of the moving mass would all affect the responses of the 
structures, experimental studies performed by high sensitive sensors to collect transient responses and to 
analyze the data would be useful for further suggestions on design of the structures under the moving 
mass.  
Fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) are one of the fiber optic sensors that have been successfully employed 
to monitor structures [10-12]. They have small sizes, corrosion resistance, light weight, and are immune to 
electromagnetic interferences (EMI). In this project, we experimentally investigate the moving mass 
problem on a cantilever beam by an FBG displacement and strain sensing system. An FBG displacement 
sensor is set up by a concept that transforms the strain along the grating to the displacement relative to a 
fixed stage. This concept has been successfully employed to set up point-wise FBG out-of-plane and 
in-plane displacement sensors to simultaneously measure three-dimensional wave propagation on a solid 
[13]. Compared to average non-contact sensors, such as laser Doppler vibrometers which are usually 
cumbersome, the proposed FBG displacement sensing system occupies much smaller space except for the 
light source. Apart from the FBG sensors, this work employs polyvinylidene fluoride film (PVDF) sensors, 
a conventional strain gauge, and a high-speed camera to investigate the moving mass problem.  
In this projectr, the above-mentioned sensors are employed to investigate responses of the cantilever 
beam with a slide on its surface under a moving steel ball. Impact loadings by a hammer or a steel ball are 
first generated to demonstrate dynamic sensing abilities of the proposed FBG sensing system. Apart from 
comparing the measurement responses by different sensors, finite element computations are employed to 
validate dynamic sensing performance of the proposed FBG displacement sensing system. Then, the steel 
ball is rolled along the slide to generate vibrations. To discuss the responses from the point of view of 
vibration modes, transient responses obtained from displacement and strain sensors are analyzed using fast 
Fourier transform (FFT) as well as short-time Fourier transform (STFT) techniques.  
This result of this project is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the sensing principle of FBG. 
Vibration modes of the cantilever beam are provided in section 3. The experimental setup and 
measurement results are reported and discussed in section 4.

    The broadband light source in Fig. 1 is first transmitted to the FBG filter, then reflected back to a 
photodetector, which transforms the light intensity to the electrical signal, and then to an oscilloscope. The 
output light intensity is contributed by the overlap of the spectra of the FBG sensor and the FBG filter,

The wavelength mismatch δλ  should be adjusted before performing dynamic measurement to obtain

In this work, apart from being a conventional strain sensor, the FBG is also set up as a point-wise 
displacement sensor. Photos in Fig. 1 show the proposed FBG displacement sensor and illustrate the 
method for setting up the FBG as the displacement sensor on a multilayer piezoelectric actuator with a 
mix of epoxy resin and hardener [18]. 
 
3.  Dynamics of a Cantilever Beam 
In this report, a cantilever beam with a slide on the surface under impact or moving mass loadings is 
investigated. Transient responses induced by moving mass loadings are much complex than those induced 
by impact loadings. By the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, when neglecting the effects of shear deformation, 
rotary inertia, and effect of the slide, the model of the cantilever beam under a moving mass can be 
expressed as [7]

The space variable ( )xΘ  can be written as:

where A  and B  are constants determined by the boundary conditions of the cantilever beam. The

respectively. Thus, we can get Young’s modulus 69.44 GPaE =  and Poisson’s ratio 0.33ν = . Values of 
Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio will be used in finite element computations using ABAQUS. The 
cantilever beam model is discretized with 55,271 elements. In this work, only resonant frequencies within 
5500 Hz are considered. Figures 3 and 4 show resonant frequencies and mode shapes obtained from FEM 
computations for bending and torsional modes, respectively. There is only one longitudinal mode within 
5500 Hz. Its value is 4509 Hz obtained in theory and 4533 Hz obtained in FEM. The error between theory 
and FEM for the longitudinal mode is only 0.52 %.  
 
4.  Experimental Results and Discussion 
The schematic diagram of the FBG sensing system is shown in Fig. 1. Light with relative flat spectrum is 
transmitted from a broadband source (BBS), with a wavelength ranging from 1520 to 1570 nm, to an 
isolator. This setup can prevent the light from reflecting back to the light source. The reflected light from 
the FBG sensor, demodulated by the FBG filter, is transmitted back to a circulator and directed to the 
corresponding photodetector (PDA10CS, InGaAs amplified detector, Thorlabs, Inc) on the output channel. 
The detecting electrical signals are recorded by an oscilloscope (LeCroy 64Xs). By the translation stage, 
the dip transmittance of the FBG filter can be adjusted to meet the optimal demodulation condition before 
the measurement. The FBG sensor as well as the FBG filter are written in photosensitive single-mode 
fibers by using the phase mask technique with a KrF excimer laser (248 nm). Both grating lengths of the 
FBG sensor and FBG filter are 10 mm. The Bragg wavelengths of the FBG sensors as well as FBG filters 
are centered around 1560 nm.  
Two FBG sensors are employed in our work. The first FBG (i.e., FBG1 shown in Fig. 2) is a 
point-wise sensor which can measure out-of-plane displacement responses. Due to the fact that the 
proposed FBG displacement sensor is very sensitive, it is attached near the fixed end of the cantilever 
beam to avoid saturations of measurements. A non-contact Fotonic displacement sensor (FS, MTI-2100, 
MTI Instruments, Albany, NY, USA), with a sensitivity of 0.02 µm/mV , is also employed as a 
comparison for the proposed FBG displacement sensor. The second FBG (i.e., FBG2 shown in Fig. 2) is a 
strain sensor that mounted on the surface and near the fixed end of the cantilever beam to obtain largest 
dynamic strain. Apart from FBG sensors, two PVDF sensors and a conventional strain gauge are also 
employed in this work for comparison of the strain responses measured by the FBG strain sensor. On the 
right in Fig. 2 is the photo of the slide where the other end of it is not connected to the cantilever beam. 
The slide will be used if the experiment of moving mass is performed. A steel ball, initially attached to an 
electromagnet by magnetic force as shown in the photo in Fig. 2, is rolled along the slide and hit another

The resolution of the STFT in time and frequency domains is affected by the applied window. In this study, 
the STFT is performed using a 64 point Hamming window. Figure 11 shows the STFT results obtained 
from measurements by FBG1. We can see that intensity of the first mode (i.e., 31 Hz) dominates the 
overall responses and last longer than the rest modes. From Fig. 11, we can observe three characteristics in 
the vibration responses. First, the second and the third bending modes (i.e., 194 Hz and 544 Hz) decay 
gradually after the ball hits the beam and the higher modes decay faster than the lower modes. Second, as 
shown in Fig. 11(b), higher modes can reflect characteristics of multiple impacts of the ball than the lower 
modes. Third, from the variations of the third bending mode, we can see that the intensity of each local 
maximum decreases gradually due to the fact that the bouncing height of the ball decreases gradually. 
    Next, we examine dynamic strain responses obtained from the strain sensors (i.e., FBG2, PVDFs, and 
a strain gauge). Two PVDFs are bounded on the top surface (i.e., PVDF1) and bottom surface (i.e., 
PVDF2) of the cantilever beam, respectively. The transient strain responses are shown in Fig. 12, in which 
the response obtained from PVDF2 has been multiplied by 1−  for convenience of comparison. Good 
agreements can be obtained from the four strain sensors. However, from Fig. 12 we can see that the FBG 
and PVDFs have higher signal to noise ratio (SNR) than the strain gauge. 
After obtaining out-of-plane displacement and in-plane strain responses, the FFT technique is 
performed on the transient responses and resonant frequencies are obtained. Table 1 lists resonant 
frequencies obtained from theory, FEM computations, FBG1, FBG2, and PVDF1, respectively. From 
Table 1 we can see that the resonant frequencies of bending modes obtained from experimental 
measurements are slightly lower than those obtained from theory and FEM computations. This is due to 
the fact that it is not easy to have a perfect fixed boundary in actual situations.  
    After dynamic behaviors of the cantilever beam under impact loadings have been demonstrated, next 
we examine moving mass-induced dynamic responses. To generate different speeds of the moving mass 
along the cantilever beam, two methods of rolling the steel ball are adopted in this work. The first method 
(method 1) is rolling a 4 mm diameter steel ball down the slide (as shown in the photo in Fig. 2) and hit 
another 9.53 mm diameter steel ball initially resting on the free end of the beam. The end of the slide does 
not connect to the beam so that only the 9.53 mm diameter steel ball will move toward the fixed end of the 
cantilever beam. The second method (method 2) is rolling a 9.53 mm diameter steel ball down the slide to 
hit another steel ball with the same size, thus generating the moving mass with higher velocities.  
To see the velocities of the moving steel ball with 9.53 mm diameter by two methods, a high-speed 
camera (Pulnix TM-6740GE, 200 frames/second) is employed to record the rolling history of the steel ball. 
By recording the locations with time, the function can be obtained and represented by curve fitting 
 14 
along the centerline of the slide on the cantilever beam. It can be also seen from Table 2 that FBG2 and 
strain gauge is not able to detect torsional modes or most bending modes. 
Table 3 lists resonant frequencies obtained in method 2. Compared with the results in Table 2, which 
is the case when the ball rolls at lower speed, more bending modes and torsional modes can be detected 
from strain sensors (i.e., FBG2 and strain gauge) in method 2. Similar to method 1 in Table 2, strain 
sensors can detect the lateral bending mode. However, in method 2, the resonant frequency of the lateral 
bending mode obtained from strain sensors (i.e., 308 Hz, compared with 297 Hz) is more close to the 
theoretical and numerical predictions. It is worthy to note that the resonant frequencies measured by three 
different experimental methods, i.e., FBG1, FBG2 and Sg, are nearly the same. 
 
6.  Conclusions 
In this project, by experimentally investigating a cantilever beam subjected to impact or moving 
mass loadings, excellent sensing performances of an FBG-based displacement and strain sensing system 
are demonstrated. Dynamic behaviors of the cantilever beam subjected to impact loading or under a 
moving mass are discussed from vibration modes. Dynamic measurement results of transient responses 
obtained from the proposed FBG displacement sensor are compared with FEM computations and a 
non-contact Fotonic displacement sensor. Responses of the FBG strain sensor are simultaneously 
compared with those obtained from polyvinylidene fluoride film (PVDF) sensors and a strain gauge. For 
the moving mass loadings, a high-speed camera is employed to detect the moving speed. Based on the 
measurement results with high sensitivities, this work experimentally discusses the dynamic 
characteristics of the cantilever beam under different loading conditions in detail.
