I. Introduction 
Educational assessment is essential to 
modern teaching activities. Teachers use tests 
to know how much students have learned, 
and further determine whether students are 
meeting educational objectives. Hundreds or 
even thousands of test items must be 
developed to measure student performance, 
which comes at a significant cost, time, and 
effort. The traditional approach to test 
construction requires much human labor, 
which make it difficult to meet the ever 
increasing demand for more test items [1]. 
Automated Item Generation (AIG) can 
produce a large number of high-quality items 
algorithmically, which is an alternative 
approach to item development that can 
supplement the traditional approach [2][3]. 
One of the common AIG techniques is to 
generate items from predefined templates. 
The advantages of template-based generation 
include easy implementation, less 
development time. Based on pure string 
manipulation, however, it is quite difficult 
for AIG to make use of any linguistic 
knowledge [4].  The study describes an 
object-oriented dynamic AIG technique, and 
its application to a web-based math word 
problem test system in Chinese. 
The remainder of the report is organized 
as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the 
classification of Chinese math word 
problems for elementary students. Section 3 
describes the object-oriented dynamic item 
generation mechanism. An online math word 
problem test system is introduced in Section 
4. Finally, we conclude our work and 
describe future work in Section 5. 
II. Math Word Problem classification 
Quantity is one the five major fields of 
elementary math course in Taiwan [5]. The 
study of quantity starts with numbers, first 
natural number and arithmetical operations 
on them, which are primarily the scope of 
this study. 
Some researchers divided math word 
problems about natural numbers into the 
following categories [6]. 
1.Join: Connie had 5 marbles. Juan gave 
her 8 more marbles. How many marbles does 
Connie have altogether? 
2.Separate: Connie had 13 marbles. She 
gave 5 to Juan.  How many marbles does 
Connie have left? 
3.Part-part-whole: Connie has 5 red 
marbles and 8 blue marbles. How many 
marbles does she have? 
4.Compare: Connie has 13 marbles. 
Juan has 5 marbles. How many more marbles 
does Connie have than Juan?  
According to operands and semantics, [7] 
classified Chinese math word problems into 
various types. Problem classification for 
integer addition and subtraction are listed in 
Table 1. Please refer to [7] for more details 
about integer multiplication and division. 
III. DYNAMIC ITEM GENERATION 
The proposed automatic item generation 
mechanism was conducted based on [7]’s 
classification and the core of object-oriented 
technology - to mimic the real world. The

test system was developed.  
System Analysis 
The system aimed at providing users 
(actors), i.e. the student and the teacher, with 
the following functionality, as illustrated in 
Fig. 5. 
(1) Do Exercise: The student can use the 
system as an exercise tool anytime and 
anywhere for learning purpose.  
(2) Take Test: The student can take a test 
online within a valid period, which is 
assigned by the teacher. If the student 
cannot finish the test in time, the system 
will terminate the test by force. 
(3) Inquire Grade: Both the student and the 
teacher can inquire about exercise or test 
records. Once a test is completed, the 
class grading list and its statistical 
analysis are available. 
(4) Manage Test: The teacher can organize a 
test by deciding the number of problems 
and their types, and specifying their 
difficulty levels. The teacher needs to 
announce this test information to the 
student in class. 
(5) Manage Account: The teacher can 
manage account information of students, 
and keep track of their learning progress. 
All the above functions required the 
validation of user identification. 
Design and Implementation 
The system was designed to be a 
web-based application. Fig. 6 depicts its 
architecture. It was implemented under 
MS-Windows XP(SP2) environment with 
following tools. 
(1) Web Server: Apache 2.2.4 
(2) Programming: PHP 5.2.1 
(3) Database: MySQL 5.0.27 
The dynamic item generation 
mechanism described in the previous section 
was implemented in C++ language as a 
standalone console application, with which 
the Apache web server can communicate 
through CGI(Common Gateway Interface), as 
illustrated in Fig. 6. 
Results 
The system had been on its preliminary 
trial for the fifth-grade class in Shan-Jiao 
Elementary School, Miaoli, Taiwan. First, 
the teacher had to create and manage 
accounts for the class, as shown in Fig. 7. 
The teacher can organize a test and then 
inform the class of the details, as shown in 
Fig. 8.
