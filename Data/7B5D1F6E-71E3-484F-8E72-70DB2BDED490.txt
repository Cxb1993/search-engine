Abstract 
In this report, an algorithm to obtain the near-optimal pilot patterns for analytic interpolator is proposed. 
Analytic interpolator is superior to the linear and cubic spline interpolation methods on short and 
nonequidistant pilot patterns, but its performance will be degraded significantly by high noise enhancement 
factor due to unfitted pilot pattern selection. Therefore, we can improve the performance of analytic 
interpolation by choosing the pilot patterns that can minify the noise enhancement factor. Under specified 
pilot density, the near-optimal pilot patterns with least noise enhancement factor can be easily resolved 
through an algorithm shown in this paper. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm works near 
optimally.

We propose an algorithm for analytic interpolator to generate the pilot patterns minimizing the noise 
enhancement factor. 
The flow chart of proposed algorithm is shown in Fig. 2. 
4. SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
In this section, the optimal pilot pattern generation algorithm will be verified by computer simulation. 
The number of subcarriers N is 16. Firstly, we use exhaustive method to find the optimal pilot patterns with 
minimum 1( ) HML MLtr F F  −⎡ ⎤⎣ ⎦  or maximum  det(  )HML MLF F   on M=7 and 10, as shown in Table 1 and 2, 
respectively. Nest, the optimal pilot pattern list derived form the proposed optimal pilot pattern generation 
algorithm is shown in Table 3, in which M=7 and 10. 
Comparing the optimal pilot patterns list in Table 1 and 2 with Table 3, they are totally identical.  
Therefore, the proposed optimal pilot pattern generation algorithm can generate all optimal pilot patterns that 
meet the optimization problem shown in (11). 
5. CONCLUSIONS 
 
The optimal pilot pattern for analytic interpolator can mitigate the noise enhancement significantly. This 
pattern is not unique, and the key point to select the optimal pattern is the distance between adjacent pilots. To 
find optimal pilot pattern is an optimization problem on minimizing trace of a specific matrix. Through a 
series of manipulation of matrix, the optimization problem has been reduced to a simpler equivalent problem 
of pilot distance permutation. The algorithm generating all near-optimal pilot patterns derived from the 
reduced optimization problem has illustrated. The proposed algorithm has verified through numerical 
simulation.
