Due to its mobility, as the user logs into and accesses the wireless network, the adjacent base 
stations proceed to “handover” to provide seamless service. The process of handover does not 
interrupt the access, but creates a mutual authentication between the user and the target BS. The 
biggest challenge is to control the duration of the authentication. It should not be so long that it 
affects the quality of service. Therefore, the tolerance of authentication latency is shorter than the 
tolerance of login authentication. Since the system does not prompt the user to input a password, 
the user does not participate in the process of handover authentication. The user will barely notice 
a change in the BS and as a result, this satisfies the transparency 
 
Although login authentication requires a password for activation, this protocol addresses other 
issues that require login authentication during handover authentication. In addition, the handover 
authentication requires a higher level of performance. In both login authentication and handover 
authentication, the user’s mobile platform initiates communication. Except login authentication 
requires a password for activation, issues that login authentication faced are all included in handover 
authentication, and handover authentication requires higher performance. This project proposes an 
efficient inter-domain handover authentication protocol, intra-domain handover authentication 
protocol, and a protocol concerning login authentication. 
 
二、文獻探討 
Researchers propose four types of protocols to solve handover authentication [1-12]:  
(a) Prediction Based Protocol 
(b) Pre-Authentication Based Protocol 
(c) Ticket Based Protocol 
(d) Group Key Based Protocol 
In prediction-based approaches [2, 5, 6], the BS the user is attempting to connect and handover to 
will send authentication information, or keys for authentication, to the target base stations. Because 
the user and the target BS share common keys and information, they can complete the handover 
faster. This is the advantage of the prediction-based approach. A disadvantage of this approach is that 
the authentication information or keys transfer via the BS or AS before handover and predicting the 
next BS is very difficult. If researchers send the authentication information to all neighboring base 
stations, performance becomes another issue. In addition, the adversary may also trace the user. 
The pre-authentication approach [1, 7] mutually authenticates the user and the next BS via the 
current BS. The pre-authentication process also generates a session key. When the user moves to the 
next BS, they can use the session key to encrypt the exchanged messages since the mutual 
authentication has already occurred. Therefore, as the user moves to the target BS, it is only 
necessary for simple authentication for users to initiate communication with the target BS. The 
primary disadvantage of the pre- authentication approach is the ability to predict the target BS. If the 
user does employ the pre-authentication process with all neighbor bases stations, it requires an 
increase in computation and communication costs. Only one of the neighboring base stations will 
provide service for the user.  
Ticket-based methods [4, 8, 9] refer to when the users handover to a target BS, they will transmit 
some of their identity information to the BS. After the BS receives the information, it queries the 
authentication information or authentication keys that belong to the user. Both parties then utilize the 
information and keys to finalize the handover authentication. The advantage of this kind of method is 
that the ticket-based approach can rapidly complete the process of handover authentication without 
much to do in advance. However, the query on the BS side might increase the communication and 
computation costs required to get the user’s ticket. This causes an increase in latency. Whether the BS 
could decipher the information in the ticket and query out the user during the inter-domain handover 
also becomes a problem.

SK: Session Key that the user exchange messages with the base station while using the network 
service after authentication. 
GK_A: Group Key Shared between AS and ASNs. 
ESK<>: Symmetric Encryption by SK. 
EPUK_A{}: Asymmetric Encryption with A’s Public Key. 
h(): One-way Hash function. 
 
Registration Phase 
The user must register at an AS by this phase before they initially request wireless network services. 
This server becomes the user’s home Domain AAA Server (hAS). The execution of this phase occurs 
within a secure channel. The MS completes registration at the hAS using the following steps. The MS 
then obtains the pseudo name and authentication key. Figure 2 details each step of the Registration 
Phase 
Step R1: MS proposes a registration request to hAS.  The request contains user’s identification, and 
information needed for payment. 
Step R2: hAS confirms the identity and replies TempID1, AK1, and IAK0 to MS. These three 
numbers are selected by hAS randomly. 
 
Login Authentication Phase 
If users (MS) attempt to access the network services via wireless connection, they must authenticate 
with the base station (sBS) and the Domain AAA Server (sAS) at the scene. Mutual authentication, 
pseudo name update, and key update occur in this phase. The MS holds the pseudo name TempIDi 
and logs in using following steps to access the network service. Figure 3 shows the Login 
Authentication Phase steps of the proposed scheme. The dotted line represents transmission under the 
secure channel. 
Step L1: MS sends an EAPOL Start to sBS in order to request network access. 
Step L2: sBS replies with EAP ID Request message to MS. 
Step L3: MS gives EAP ID Response {TempIDi, hAS} to sBS. 
Step L4: sBS forwards {TempIDi, hAS} to sAS via sASN in secure channel.  If sAS is not hAS of 
MS, sAS gets MS’ AKi from hAS by the following substeps. 
Substep L4-1:sAS asks hAS for the AKi of MS that TempIDi represents. 
Substep L4-2: hAS gives sAS the corresponding AKi of TempIDi. 
Step L5: sAS sends {TempIDi, AKi} through sASN to sBS. 
Step L6: sBS selects BS_Rand and computes h(AKi|| BS_Rand|| sBS|| TempIDi).  And then, sends 
{BS_Rand, sBS, h(AKi|| BS_Rand|| sBS|| TempIDi)} to MS.

Step L11: MS generates information for next authentication by following substeps. 
Substep L11-1: makes sure the correctness of PUK_sAS with h(PUK_sAS|| AKi). 
Substep L11-2: randomly generates the pseudo name TempIDi+1 and a number x, and encrypts 
TempIDi, TempIDi+1, x, and h(AKi|| TempIDi+1|| x) by PUK_sAS.  Then he sends it to 
sAS via sBS and sASN. 
Substep L11-3: generates AKi+1= h(AKi|| TempIDi+1|| x) and IAKj+1= h(IAKj|| TempIDi+1|| x|| 
hAS).  AKi+1 is the authentication key for next login authentication.  IAKj+1 is the 
authentication key for next inter-domain handover. 
Step L12: sAS generates information for MS’ next authentication using following substeps. 
Substep L12-1: decrypts the message of Substep L11-2 to get TempIDi, TempIDi+1, x and h(AKi|| 
TempIDi+1|| x).  Then he generates AKi+1= h(AKi|| TempIDi+1|| x) and checks its 
correctness. 
Substep L12-2: sends {TempIDi+1, AKi+1} to the sASN and nASN. 
Substep L12-3: If the sAS is not hAS of MS, sAS sends TempIDi, TempIDi+1, and x to MS’ hAS. 
Step L13: hAS generates and records MS’ next authentication key AKi+1= h(AKi|| TempIDi+1|| x) and 
pseudo name TempIDi+1. 
Step L14: hAS generates IAKj+1= h(IAKj|| TempIDi+1|| x|| hAS), and sends {TempIDi, TempIDi+1, 
IAKj+1} and sAS’ identity to nAS of MS by secure channel. 
Step L15: nAS encrypts IAKj+1 by GK_nAS and sends {EGK_nAS<IAKj+1>, TempIDi} to sAS. 
Step L16: sAS sends {EGK_nAS<IAKj+1>, nAS, h(EGK_nAS<IAKj+1>|| nAS|| AKi)} to MS. 
Step L17: MS checks and records EGK_nAS<IAKj+1> and nAS. 
In steps L1 ~ L3, and L6 ~ L8, the network uses EAP to perform message transmission. Figure 4 
displays the packet format of the EAP. The transmitted information can be treated as DATA in the 
EAP packet. The steps L4, L5, and L8 package the transmitted information in the AVPs of the 
RADIUS packet. Figure 5 shows the packet format of the RADIUS. In this phase, the MS and the BS 
authenticate each other and generate the session key for communication. The MS also updates both 
the pseudo name and authentication keys. 
 
Inter-Domain Handover Authentication Phase 
The network service should sustain during mobile user movement. It is possible to move from the 
network-serving region of one base station (sBS) to another (tBS). These base stations belong to the 
Domain AAA Servers sAS and tAS, respectively. The proposed protocol utilizes the information that 
the user completed at the preceding authentication phase to reduce the authentication delay and lower 
the impact to the usage of user’s network connection. To ensure anonymity, the user will use a 
different pseudo name at each different base station. In the proposed protocol, the user uses the 
pseudo name TempIDi at sBS and uses the pseudo name TempIDi+1 at tBS. The following steps 
demonstrate the inter-domain handover authentication procedure when a user moves from the sBS to 
the tBS. Figure 6 shows the steps during the Inter-Domain Authentication Phase. 
Step H1: MS sends EAPOL Start message to the tBS.  In the meantime, he generates Inter-Token= 
[TempIDi+1,EGK_tAS<IAKj+1>, h(TempIDi+1|| IAKj+1)]. 
Step H2: tBS sends EAP ID Request to MS in response of the EAPOL Start message. 
Step H3: MS responds with Inter-Token to tBS. 
Step H4: tBS forwards Inter-Token to tASN in secure channel. 
Step H5: tASN decrypts EGK_tAS<IAKj+1> to gets IAKj+1 and verifies the correctness of 
h(TempIDi+1||IAKj+1).  If it is true, he sends TempIDi+1 and IAKj+1 to tBS.  Otherwise, he 
notifies the tBS to stop the connection.

and generates the session key SK= h(IAKj+1|| TempIDi+1|| MS_Rand|| BS_Rand) shared with 
MS for securing the network services afterward. 
Step H9: MS generates the session key SK= h(IAKj+1|| TempIDi+1|| MS_Rand|| BS_Rand) shared with 
tBS. 
Step H10: tBS begins to provide MS with network service and encrypts exchanged messages 
with SK when needed. 
Step H11: tBS sends {PUK_tAS, h(PUK_tAS|| IAKj+1)} to MS. 
Step H12: MS generates information for next authentication by following substeps. 
Substep H12-1: makes sure the correctness of PUK_tAS with h(PUK_tAS|| IAKj+1). 
Substep H12-2: randomly generates the pseudo name TempIDi+2 and a number x.  Then he 
encrypts TempIDi+1, TempIDi+2, x, and h(IAKj+1|| TempIDi+2|| x) by the public key of tAS 
and sends it to tAS via tBS and tASN. 
Substep H12-3 generates AKi+2= h(IAKj+1|| TempIDi+2|| x) and IAKj+2= h(IAKj+1|| TempIDi+2|| x|| 
hAS).  AKi+2 is the authentication key for next login.  IAKj+2 is the authentication key 
for next inter-domain handover authentication. 
Step H13: tAS generates MS’ next authentication information by following substeps. 
Substep H13-1: decrypts the message of Substep H12-2 to derive TempIDi+1, TempIDi+2, x, and 
h(IAKj+1|| TempIDi+2|| x).  Then he generates AKi+2= h(IAKj+1|| TempIDi+2|| x) and 
checks its correctness. 
Substep H13-2: sends {TempIDi+2, AKi+2} to the tASN where MS is at and the tASN’s nASN.  
Substep H13-3: If the tAS is not hAS of MS, tAS sends {TempIDi+1, TempIDi+2, x} to MS’s hAS. 
Step H14: hAS generates MS’ next authentication keys AKi+2= h(IAKj+1|| TempIDi+2|| x) and 
IAKj+2= h(IAKj+1|| TempIDi+2|| x|| hAS).  Then he sends MS’ pseudo name TempIDi+1 and 
IAKj+2 to nAS of tAS and notifies nAS with the current MS’ tAS by secure channel. 
Step H15: nAS encrypts IAKj+2 by GK_nAS.  And then, he sends {EGK_nAS<IAKj+2>, 
TempIDi+1} to tAS by secure channel. 
Step H16: tAS generates h(EGK_nAS<IAKj+2>|| nAS|| IAKj+1) and sends {EGK_nAS<IAKj+2>, nAS, 
h(EGK_nAS<IAKj+2>|| nAS|| IAKj+1)} to MS via tBS. 
Step H17: MS checks and records {EGK_nAS<IAKj+2>, nAS}. 
 
During the inter-domain handover, the user and the base station finish mutual authentication and 
derive the session key (SK) from steps H1 to Step H9. Step H10 shows that the base station can now 
continue providing the network connection service for the user. Therefore, the authentication latency 
is complete at step H9. The steps following H11 to H17 include the information exchange and 
updating the preparation of the next authentication. This will not affect the result of this inter-domain 
handover authentication. These seven steps do not cause a delay in authentication, since they can only 
process when the MS uses the network service. The base station does not have to wait for the 
completion of steps H11 to H17 to provide the user with network connectivity. Meanwhile, the user 
and the base station do not require the assistance of the Domain AAA Server to complete the 
authentication procedure from steps H1 to H9. As a result, this shortens authentication latency. 
Therefore, the Inter-Domain Handover Authentication procedure time from steps H1 toH9 is shorter 
than the Login Authentication Phase. 
 
五、結果與討論 
The primary contribution of the proposed protocol is that it provides a secure and efficient 
inter-domain handover authentication. This project considers the speed of the handover during the 
inter-domain handover phase of the proposed protocol. The long authentication latency may cause 
network disconnection, and needs to proceed to another login authentication process to provide 
network service. The EAP is the basis for the proposed protocol, which is an authentication

Table 3 displays the comparison of the computation costs of the inter-domain handover 
authentication between the proposed protocol and other research. The proposed protocol is primarily 
costing spent 2 times of asymmetric encryption operations after Step H9.  They affect no 
authentication latency. These operations are used to offer anonymity and forward/backward secrecy 
in the proposed protocol. In terms of overall computation cost, Alfandi et al.[1] and Tuladhar et al.[8] 
presented more calculations than this study. Although Sun et al.[6] and Wang et al.[9] presented half 
of the asymmetric encryption computations, they did not offer anonymity and backward secrecy.  
 
六、結論 
This project proposes a secure inter-domain handover authentication protocol for wireless network. 
The user’s Domain AAA Server and the Domain AAA Servers of the serving network do not need to 
join the mutual authentication process and generating session key process of the inter-domain 
handover phase. This decreases authentication latency. Therefore, the handover authentication 
process of the proposed protocol is more efficient than other studies. In terms of security functionality, 
the proposed protocol provides mutual authentication, replay attack resistance, anonymity, and 
forward/backward secrecy. It provides more security functionalities and requires less computation 
cost than other research. Due to the following billing issues, in the proposed protocol, no parties 
know the user’s identity other than user’s Domain AAA Server. Even the information of the base 
station could not identify the identity of the user. In summary, the proposed protocol is superior to 
other methods because it has shorter authentication latency and greater security functionality.
