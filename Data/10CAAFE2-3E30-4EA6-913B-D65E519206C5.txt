中文摘要 
當無線通訊器材的數量從數以百萬計成長到了數以兆計時，傳統的無線通訊科技已經
無法應付這樣的網路，亦難受到次世代無線通訊標準的採用。因此，本計畫「第四代無線
通訊之合作暨認知網路技術」集合了許多先進的無線科技，期能共同達到 IMT-Advanced
所制定的條件，並進而成為次世代無線標準的候選人之一。在本整合型計畫裡，我們把重
心放在五項無線電感知與合作式網路中重要的議題上，其分別包含在以下的五個子計畫中： 
 
 （子計畫一）採用下世代多碼分工技術的合作式無限通訊系統之研究 
 （子計畫二）正交分頻多工接取合作與感知通訊的跨階層設計 
 （子計畫三）支援第四代系統群播與廣播服務之互助網路技術 
 （子計畫四）感知與合作式第四代無線網路之賽局理論架構研究 
 （子計畫五）適應式合作無線網路之跨實體與媒體接取層最佳化 
 
在子計畫一中，我們探討了於合作式無線通訊系統下使用多載波實現的次世代 CDMA
科技之應用可行性，以及一個設計基於次世代 CDMA科技的合作式無線網路架構之可能方
式，其中對於合作式無線通訊的成功運作而言，正確的多重接取技術科技之選擇是格外重
要的。 
由於在感知無線電網路下機會式鏈結的本質，達到系統效能最佳化的先進設計是不可
避免的。因此，子計畫二提出了允許封包服務品質（QoS）保證的統計性延遲控制演算法、
包含普遍性頻率重新使用及 OFDMA系統設計的無線電資源分配演算法，以及能夠提供動
態頻譜接取（DSA）快速重置的新式通訊處理器架構。 
群播與廣播服務（MBS）能夠大大地提升頻譜效率，被視為是在 4G 無線通訊系統中
最為重要的服務方式之一。然而，實際上服務架構的選擇不應該侷限於單一個基地台，因
此我們在子計畫三中提出了一個服務架構選擇的演算法，企圖去找出最好的 MBS 服務架
構以提升頻譜效率。 
當我們把合作式通訊包含進去感知無線電網路時，主要使用者能夠避免掉不必要的重
傳，而次級使用者可以提升他們傳送的機會，在沒有影響主要使用者的情況下。因此，我
們在子計畫四中提出了一個合作式接力方案，稱之為感知性次級使用者協助傳遞
（Cognitive-Enhanced Secondary Assisted Relay, CESAR）的機制，以提升在基於競爭的感知
無線電網路下的效能。此外，我們探討了在CESAR機制下，不同接力點選擇方案的影響，
以及個人理性，並進而設計出實現有無電池限制的CESAR機制－利他性與誘因性模式－之
分散式演算法的設計。 
為了最有效地使用合作式傳輸，我們提出了一個基於 ECMA-368標準的保留式信號機
制在子計畫五中。選擇好的接力設備對於有效的合作而言是很重要的。為了找出最好的接
力，來源設備會在保留的時間區間內送出一個 Relay-Link-Query（RLQ）訊框。當來自於
辨識出的接力設備之 RLQ訊框被來源設備所接收，則來源設備將藉由合作在保留的時間區
間內傳送資料。

Abstract 
As the number of wireless communicating devices raises from millions to trillions, 
traditional wireless communications technology can no longer support such network and has 
difficulty to be adopted in next-generation wireless communication standard. Therefore, this 
project entitled “Cooperative and Cognitive Networking toward 4G Wireless Communications” 
gathers several advanced wireless technologies to jointly reach IMT-Advanced requirements as a 
candidate of next-generation wireless standard. In this integrated project, we focus on five 
important topics in cognitive radio and cooperative networks, which are included in the 
following five subprojects: 
 
 (Subproject 1) Cooperative Wireless Communications based on Next Generation CDMA 
Technologies 
 (Subproject 2) Cross-layer Design of OFDMA Cooperative and Cognitive Communications 
 (Subproject 3) Cooperative Networking Techniques Supporting Multicast and Broadcast 
Services for 4G System 
 (Subproject 4) Game Theoretical Framework for Cognitive and Cooperative 4G Wireless 
Networks 
 (Subproject 5) Adaptive Cooperation with Cross PHY- and MAC-Layer Optimization for 
4G Wireless Networks 
 
The feasibility of the application of the next generation CDMA technologies implemented 
using multi-carrier technology in a cooperative wireless communication system and a possible 
way to design a cooperative wireless network architecture based on the next generation CDMA 
technologies has been studied in subproject 1, where the choice of the right multiple access 
technology is particularly critical to the successful operation of the cooperative wireless 
communications. 
Due to the essence of opportunistic links in cognitive radio network (CRN), advanced 
designs for achieving optimal system-level performance are inevitable. Subproject 2 therefore 
proposes statistical delay control algorithm enabling packet-level QoS guarantees, radio resource 
allocation algorithm including universal frequency reuse (UFR) and OFDMA system design, and 
new communication processor architecture provisioning fast reconfiguration for dynamic 
spectrum access (DSA). 
Multicast and broadcast service (MBS) which can greatly improve spectral efficiency has 
been considered as one of the most important services for 4G wireless communication systems. 
However, in reality, service architecture selection should not be limited to a single BS, thus we 
proposed a service architecture selection algorithm in subproject 3 to find the best MBS service 
architecture to improve the spectral efficiency. 
As incorporating cooperative communication into CRN, primary users can prevent 
unnecessary retransmission, and secondary users can improve their transmission opportunities 
without drawing primary users' attention. Therefore, a new cooperative relay scheme called

I. INTRODUCTION 
As human demands on wireless applications grow rapidly and tremendously, wireless 
communications turns to be an emerging technology in the future. Nokia incorporation has made an 
estimation that the number of wireless devices will be drastically increased, say from the order of 
million to trillion. In other words, the number of devices surrounding around you may be a million 
times from now. Consequently, traditional wireless communications technology can no longer 
support such network and has difficulty to become a possible next-generation wireless standard. 
The next-generation, the so-called 4G though non-official yet, wireless standards to meet 
IMT-Advanced requirements of a nominal data rate of 100 Mbps for high mobility and 1 Gbps for 
fixed application have been previously defined by ITU-R. Figure 1 depicts the migration of 
air-interface technology toward IMT-Advance with possible air-interface of code division multiple 
access (CDMA) and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA). For the purpose of 
reaching 4G requirements, 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) and IEEE 802.16 standards came 
into being and have been regarded as prospective candidates of next-generation technologies. 
However, both technologies are still under development and more advanced research on 
technology innovations are inevitable. 
 
 
Figure 1. Migration of air-Interface technology 
 
With the fact that the policy of fixed spectrum assignment in today’s wireless networks 
leads to the inefficiency usage of this limited radio resource, cognitive radio (CR) and further 
cognitive radio network (CRN), which allows terminal devices to actively control their 
transmission parameters and behaviors through sense-then-act process so as to leverage 
communication opportunities, turns to be a promising technology for developing advanced 
next-generation wireless networks. 
In addition, devices in traditional wireless networks communicate with each other over a 
10 
 
available radio access technologies (RATs), to judge the network condition accordingly, and making 
decisions to utilizing available frequency bands. Due to the heterogeneity of the network which 
results in fluctuation of wireless channel and mobility of relay nodes, MAC and spectrum sharing to 
utilize all the available resource in an optimal way are studied. Based on the completion of resource 
management, routing, QoS control, and HARQ in such a dynamic network have been designed to 
opportunistic links so as to provide anytime/anywhere services. In addition, network selection 
algorithm is investigated to leverage different RATs with different quality of links. 
Now, we look into the issues in upper layer, say network layer. Point-to-Multipoint in downlink 
would be a common approach for multicast and broadcast service (MBS), but exact value of channel 
quality indicator (CQI) for each user may not be necessary to be reported via the feedback channel. 
For this reason, a threshold-based channel quality feedback method has been therefore proposed in 
subproject 3. At the BS side, it uses multicast-Poll (MC-Poll) to query the downlink signal quality 
and reserves shared or dedicated uplink resource (for users belonging to the same multicast group) as 
reply channel. The query conditions can be CQI (RSSI/BER/QoS) thresholds or regions. UEs shall 
send a message via the reply channel if its CQI is less than the given CQI-threshold or its CQI 
belongs to the specified region. The uplink transmission power may be set to a given value or based 
open loop power control. At the BS side, BS may decrease the MCS or increase the transmission 
power to improve the UE’s CQI if any reply is received. Optionally, BS may send the MC-ACK to 
UEs for confirmation. If no reply is received, BS may increase the CQI threshold for the next query 
and may increase the MCS or decrease the transmission power to improve spectral efficiency 
In subproject 4, a game-theoretic solution for inter-cell radio resource management and a 
credit-token based spectrum sharing algorithm which comprises mechanisms of spectrum renting, 
offering, and contention have been proposed. In addition, it is confirmed that a Nash equilibrium 
always exists and the spectrum allocation at the Nash equilibrium is always unique by applying game 
theory to formulate the spectrum sharing problem. Several desirable properties, including allocative 
efficiency, Pareto optimality, weighted max-min fairness, and weighted proportional fairness, are 
attained at the Nash equilibrium. Extended from the spectrum sharing algorithm, a strategy-proof, 
efficient and fair spectrum allocation mechanism to adopt in the general case that BSs' max spectrum 
demands are private information have also been devised. On the other hand, an efficient and fair 
spectrum sharing scheme is proposed. The proposed spectrum sharing algorithm is desirable because 
it achieves efficiency and fairness among all BSs. The spectrum allocation is efficient as allocative 
efficiency and Pareto optimality are achieved. It also meets both weighted max-min fair and weighted 
proportional fair criteria. By adopting this spectrum allocation result, a strategy-proof mechanism, 
ensuring efficiency and fairness at the truth-revealing dominant-strategy equilibrium, is designed to 
apply in the more general case that max traffic demands are private information. 
A new cooperative MAC protocol that considers both MAC and PHY in distributed networks 
and meanwhile maximize the system throughput has been proposed in subproject 5. In the proposed 
protocol, the source device will cooperate with a single relay and apply AF forward strategy to 
improve the throughput. The relay is selected via the contention of the relay candidates. In the 
contention, the busy tones are used to rank the relay candidates, so that the selected relay is always 
one of the relay candidates with better performance. The protocol also allows the devices to transmit 
12 
 
adjust transmission power on subcarriers and to adaptively allocate subcarriers among users, the 
system performance can then be optimized. 
From implementation perspective, realizing software-defined radio (SDR) requires 
leveraging unique properties inherited in communication algorithms in order to satisfy the two 
contradicting needs: high processing power and low power consumption. Although 
reconfigurable architecture is attractive to provide high processing power with a low power 
dissipation, the instruction issuing and controlling mechanism is too complicated to provide fast 
reconfiguration for dynamic spectrum access (DSA). Different from traditional approaches which 
only explore either circuit architecture or algorithms, we jointly consider the common 
algorithmic properties of widely applied communication algorithms and the design of processor 
architecture. We successfully developed a “green” communication processor by exploiting 
critical parallelism and data exchange patterns inherit inside commonly applied wireless 
communication algorithms along with tailoring the underlying processor architecture to take 
advantages from both approaches. 
Multicast and broadcast service (MBS) has been considered as one of the most important 
services for 4G wireless communication systems. In general, there are three ways to provide 
multimedia services to multiple users: unicast, broadcast, and multicast. Unicast is to build up 
independent point-to-point links among multiple users in the network, which wastes time in that 
same data for multiple users need to be sent individually. Broadcast constructs a 
point-to-multipoint network in which all the users can receive the same data at once. Different 
from broadcast, multicast can send data to only a subset of users within the network. Obviously, 
broadcast and multicast nature can greatly save usage and efficiency of spectrum resource, which 
is particularly important for today’s growing broadband wireless applications. 
In reality, service architecture selection should not be limited to a single BS, but the whole 
network service architecture. Therefore, we proposed a service architecture selection algorithm in 
subproject 3 to find the best MBS service architecture to improve the spectral efficiency. In order 
to figure out the overall spectral efficiency of the network, this subproject extends the scope from 
single BS to the whole network and integrates four service architectures into service providing, 
including All SC-PTM, Relay-enabled SC-PTM with SC-PTM, SFN with SC-PTM, and 
Relay-enabled SFN with SC-PTM. An analytical model is presented to derive the average mutual 
information of each cell for different service architectures. The analytical model is developed 
based on the number of subscribed users in each cell and the intended MBS coverage 
requirement. Based on a given requirement, each cell then selects a suitable with service 
architecture to maximize the overall spectral efficiency of the network. Simulations were 
conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed service architecture selection algorithm. 
In CRN with the aid of cognitive relay, primary users can prevent unnecessary 
retransmission, and secondary users can improve their transmission opportunities without 
drawing primary users' attention, and thus a new cooperative relay scheme called 
Cognitive-Enhanced Secondary-Assisted Relay (CESAR) mechanism to enhance the 
performance of contention-based cognitive radio networks is proposed in subproject 4. CESAR 
mechanism provides the coordination scheme between multiple secondary relay users. We also 
14 
 
communicating pairs that do not interfere with each other to transmit concurrently. When an 
additional device is involved in cooperative transmission, a “direct” communicating pair 
becomes a communicating triplet. The triplet implies a larger interfering area since the neighbors 
of the relay device are also subject to interference. As a result, the spatial reusability could be 
reduced in cooperative transmission. Power consumption is also an important metric in 
cooperative transmission. The performance gain of the communicating pair is actually obtained 
with the expense of the relay's power consumption. 
 
I.3 Integrated Results and Summary 
After briefly introducing the achievements of each of the subprojects, we intend to obtain 
integrated results to specifically identify our efforts during this year. Our research efforts can be 
classified into three categories as follows: 
 
Cognitive Radio Network and Cooperative Communication 
Due to the essence of opportunistic links in cognitive radio network (CRN), advanced 
designs for achieving optimal system-level performance are inevitable. In this project, we 
proposed statistical delay control algorithm enabling packet-level QoS guarantees, radio resource 
allocation algorithm including universal frequency reuse (UFR) and OFDMA system design, and 
new communication processor architecture provisioning fast reconfiguration for dynamic 
spectrum access (DSA). 
In order for primary users to prevent unnecessary retransmission, secondary users can 
improve their transmission opportunities without drawing primary users' attention through 
incorporating cooperative communication into CRN. Therefore, we proposed a new cooperative 
relay scheme called cognitive-enhanced secondary-assisted relay (CESAR) mechanism to 
enhance the performance of contention-based cognitive radio networks, and further discussed the 
impact of different relay node selection schemes in CESAR mechanism and individual rationality 
(IR). In addition, to fully take advantages of cooperative transmission, a reservation-based 
signaling mechanism based on ECMA-368 standard has been investigated in this project. 
Selection of a good relay device is crucial for effective cooperation. In order to find the best relay, 
the source device sends out a Relay-Link-Query (RLQ) frame in the reserved time period. If a 
RLQ frame is received from the identified relay device by the source device, the source device 
then transmits the data in the reserved time period via cooperation. 
 
Cooperative networking and network performance optimization 
In reality, service architecture selection should not be limited to a single BS, thus we 
proposed a service architecture selection algorithm in subproject 3 to find the best multicast and 
broadcast service (MBS) architecture to improve the spectral efficiency. Due to the essence of 
opportunistic links in cognitive radio network (CRN), we therefore proposed statistical delay

II. COOPERATIVE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS BASED ON 
NEXT GENERATION CDMA TECHNOLOGIES 
II.1 Objective and Goal 
Cooperative wireless communications work jointly with multiple intermediate relays to send 
information to the same receiving station in order to improve the detection efficiency at the 
destination receiver. The cooperative wireless communications have been considered to be used 
in the futuristic wireless communication systems to achieve spatial diversity gain through a 
virtual MIMO architecture in both point-to-multi-point (PMP) and mesh networks. Also, it is 
widely known that the spatial diversity gain in a cooperative communication system can be 
maximized if the signal separation process can be carried out efficiently at the receiver end. 
This project aims to study the feasibility of the application of the next generation CDMA 
technologies implemented using multi-carrier technology in a cooperative wireless 
communication system, where signals from different relay stations will be sent through different 
signature code channels, which should be designed jointly with user separation signature codes. 
A three-dimensional signature coding scheme will be studied and its performance will be 
evaluated explicitly in this project using both theoretical and simulation approaches. The 
three-dimensional signature coding scheme should take into account all real operational 
conditions in a cooperative wireless communication environment, such as multipath interference, 
asynchronous transmission, random data stream, etc. Under this proposed system framework, 
each user terminal (either a normal transmitter or a relay station) of such a cooperative wireless 
communication system should use a three-dimensional spreading code to send its encoded data. 
The effort will be made to minimize the interference among the transmissions to achieve 
maximal spatial diversity gain at the received end and to improve detection efficiency and 
bandwidth efficiency of the whole system. The ultimate goal of this sub-project is to propose a 
feasible architecture for futuristic wireless communication system where cooperation and 
cognitive capability will be implemented in each user terminal. This research project is one of the 
sub-project under the main NCP research project, and thus it should work closely with all the 
other sub-projects jointly to design a cooperative and cognitive wireless communication 
architecture whose system performance should be compatible to any of the future 4G wireless 
standards, such as IMT-Advanced systems. 
As mentioned in the research proposal of this sub-project, this research project is relevant to 
the key areas identified by WWRF, such as “air-interface”, “cooperative wireless”, etc. This 
proposed research project serves as one of the sub-projects under the umbrella of the joint NTPO 
project proposed under the title of “Cooperative and Cognitive Networking toward 4G Wireless 
Communications”. 
Based on our previous working experience on the next generation CDMA technology, in 
18 
 
It is widely recognized that the cooperative wireless communication is an important 
research topic for the futuristic wireless communication systems, and it has attracted a great 
amount of attention from both academia and industry in the world, as shown in the major 
reference list attached to this section below. Many important initiatives have been started in 
many universities and research facilities of the wireless industry around the world [1]-[18]. It is 
noted that 3GPP LTE system has adopted cooperative wireless communication as an important 
element in its overall air-link architecture, as indicated in the references [7]-[9]. 
On the other hand, we have to admit that multiple access technology will still play a pivotal 
role in the cooperative wireless communications due to the fact that it works based on the 
involvement of multiple entities: different terminals on the same network tier, as well as those 
working on distinct networks tiers. The choice of the right multiple access technology is critical 
to the successful operation of the cooperative wireless communications. In this proposed 
sub-project (under the umbrella of the main-project titled “Cooperative and Cognitive 
Networking toward 4G Wireless Communications”), we have been working extensively to 
investigate various important issues related to cooperative wireless communication based on the 
next generation OFDM/CDMA technology, a new multiple access technology proposed by us 
recently. We have obtained very encouraging results to show the great importance of the choice 
of the right multiple access technology in a cooperative wireless communication system. 
It is worth to mention that we have started to work on cooperative wireless communications 
almost at the same time when it was first proposed in the literature quite many years ago. Several 
publications of our works in this area have been put into the publication queue of major technical 
publications, as shown in the references [19]-[21]. However, the works published by us so far are 
very much concentrated on the generic virtual MIMO systems and they have not yet touched the 
issues on the applications of the next generation OFDM/CDMA technology in cooperative 
wireless communications. Therefore, the research work proposed in this project has been a 
starting point for us to work on many innovative system designs of a cooperative wireless 
communication system based on the next generation OFDM/CDMA technology, which will be 
able to offer a superb performance in terms of its capability to deliver a very high transmission 
rate and a robust performance under various operational environments. 
 This proposed research is one of the seven sub-projects under the main-project titled 
“Cooperative and Cognitive Networking toward 4G Wireless Communications”. Here, we would 
like to take this opportunity to say that we are extremely grateful for the support given from NSC 
to allow us to do this initial investigation on cooperative wireless network architecture based on 
the next generation CDMA technologies, as specified in the proposal of this research project. 
This is a wonderful opportunity for us to search for some important and meaningful research 
results for the overall benefit of the community. However, due to the time limit of this research 
project, which was only given two years, we have been able to get some preliminary results in 
this sub-project. This joint research project will stop after its second year project.

good solution to provide a feasible architecture to put the network coding and cooperative relay 
together in one wireless communication system design in order to achieve both bandwidth 
efficiency and diversity gain. We are now working to write a few papers based on the results 
obtained from the work in this respect and hopefully they could be published in good technical 
journals very soon. 
II.3 Summary 
As this research project has come to the end very soon, it is a good time for us to review 
what we have gone through during the previous two years. One thing I have to mention is that we 
have achieved a lot of interesting research results from the previous two years. Based on the 
results obtained through this research project, we are now preparing several papers to be 
submitted to conferences and journals.

manufacturing, which makes well known Alamouti codes (2-D) as the most popular and practical 
technique. MIMO also invokes challenges in modern SoC design. Also, we note that high 
mobility makes OFDMA subtle to channel variations and phase noise, which must be able to 
handle for any wide deployment. Typical OFDMA system design is mobile WiMAX to adopt 
AMC and MIMO as follows [1]. 
Adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) is adopted by using QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM 
(optional in UL) as modulation, and convolutional codes (mandatory), turbo codes, low-density 
parity check codes for forward error correcting codes (FEC). Of most interests, space-time codes 
(STC) and spatial multiplexing (SM) are used to enhance PHY transmission speed and reception 
quality of signals from mobile stations. Along with adaptive antenna systems (AAS) using 
beamforming technique, STC and SM form the foundation of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) 
processing for the mobile WiMAX. 
STC is originated from pioneer work of transmit diversity coding by S. Alamouti, and 
Figure 2 depicts the realization of closed-loop STC for mobile WiMAX, and Alamouti code as 
shown. There are 3 kinds of STC in the IEEE 802.16e OFDMA by using 2 or 3 antennas, while 
Alamouti code is one of them. 
 
 
 
In addition to STC and surely beamforming, spatial multiplexing can be further used, which 
is depicted in Figure 3. Spatial multiplexing transmits data streams via different spatial domains 
(typically multiple antennas). STC and spatial multiplexing can form the foundation of IEEE 
802.16e MIMO processing. BS can send control messages to indicate subsequent allocation shall 
use certain permutation with a specific transmit diversity mode, and to describe DL allocations 
assigned to MIMO enabled SSs by defining one of the 3 STC matrices.

communications system, we first analyze the delay control of opportunistic link in cognitive 
radio network in Part I, which can be used to maintain the QoS of CR in real systems. Then we 
focus on resource allocation of self-organized OFDMA wireless mesh network in Part II. This 
part is for achieving universal frequency reuse. At last, we design a communication processor for 
dynamic spectrum access using the above techniques. 
 
Part I 
Due to the underutilization of the existing scarce radio spectrum, dynamic spectrum access 
(DSA) for cognitive radios (CRs) is a promising solution receiving dramatic attentions [1]. In 
conventional development of CR technology, one common approach is the opportunistic 
spectrum access (OSA) [2], which allows CRs to seek and exploit the temporary spectrum holes 
without causing interference to primary system users (PUs). Under this consideration, the 
behavior of opportunistic transmission at a CR link introduces unpreventable delay. To network 
CRs as a cognitive radio network (CRN), Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning for end-to-end 
packet transmissions is an essential must. However, the aggregated delay from opportunistic 
links along a transmission path makes packet level QoS guarantee as a challenging issue. Since 
the availability of radio spectrum at an opportunistic link depends mainly on the activity of PUs 
in vicinity, it is infeasible to provide deterministic QoS guarantees (i.e., a zero probability of 
violating the QoS constraint) for end-to-end CR transmission along a path consisting of multiple 
opportunistic links (denoted as an opportunistic path). Throughout this part, the QoS guarantee is 
in statistical sense, that is, the QoS violation probability is ensured below a required value. 
Cooperative relay among CRs emerges as a solution to exploit user diversity and provides 
dramatic gains in reliability and capacity. Spatial diversity gain of a single communication link 
offered by beam-forming at a CR/cooperative relay was discussed in [3]–[5]. The authors in [6] 
proposed a mechanism to select the best relay from the potential CR relay group for the 
throughput maximization at a CR link under the QoS constraint of PUs. [7] explored the problem 
in a network perspective, where a cooperative scheduling algorithm was proposed to select a 
relay opportunistic path with the lowest packet dropping probability for end-to-end CR 
transmissions. To enable packet level QoS guarantees in CRN, this paper introduces redundant 
transmissions through multiple opportunistic paths to increases the reliability and availability. 
Specifically, same packet flows are simultaneously delivered over opportunistic paths in the 
same group to ensure the statistical delay. Since the larger number of groups leads higher 
aggregated throughput at the same time, this paper tries to maximize the number of groups while 
ensuring the statistical delay of each redundant transmission over the same group. This 
optimization problem is proved as the well-known bin covering optimization with NP-hard 
complexity. By the proposed Round-Robin algorithm, simulation results show that the optimal 
performance can be achieved in the case that the statistical availabilities of all opportunistic links 
are the same. This work therefore provides an essential viewpoint that via cooperative relay 
among CRs in CRN, the QoS (i.e., average delay) can be guaranteed and spectrum can be 
efficiently utilized. 
 
32 
 
 
Obviously, the challenge (i) includes the targets we try to achieve, the challenge (ii) is what 
we like to avoid and the challenge (iii) denotes the issues we need to consider when 
implementation. To conquer all the challenges, we find that OFDMA systems have the capability 
to dynamically adjust transmission power on subcarriers and to adaptively allocate subcarriers 
among users, to optimize system performance. The stable high-throughput green 
communications could be achieved by proper object functions in the optimization and the 
inter/intra cell interference could be controlled by using appropriate optimization constraints. 
The implementation considerations could be integrated by proper modifications of the 
optimization formulation. Therefore, OFDMA resource management is proposed as a suitable 
solution. We demonstrate such idea by developing a resource management for OFDMA 
self-organizing wireless mesh networks with BSs utilizing entire system spectrum. The CSI for 
resource management is collected by spectrum sensing [1] [2] to form a cognitive resource 
management [4] - [6], while spectrum sensing is originally proposed for Cognitive Radio [3]. Fig. 
1 depicts the block diagram, where blocks with bold boundary denote the essential functions. The 
system performance is optimized by properly allocating subcarriers among wireless links and 
distributing transmission power among subcarriers based on CSI of each link. The CSI includes 
two items, one is the available subcarriers which is used to control inter-cell interference and 
another is the channel fading of subcarriers which is used to support the optimizations. 
 
 
Part III 
Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) evolved from software radios and provides the sensing 
and reconfiguration capability in order to leverage spectrum white holes[1]. The ability to 
support opportunistic transmission without extra spectrum bandwidth is an attractive feature for 
future wireless communications. In order to facilitate such DSA systems, a power-efficient 
communication processor is required to support the extremely high speed operation of software 
34 
 
III.3 Mathematical Analysis 
Part I 
A. Network Topology 
SYSTEM MODEL 
We consider a network coexisted by CRs and PUs, where a CRN is existed consisting of a 
source CR (denoted as node nS), a destination CR (denoted as nD), and several relay CRs 
(denoted as nRs) that can help relay packet flows from the nS to nD. Assume that CRN is a slotted 
system and the nS and the nD are synchronous with time interval unit Δt, which consists of 
spectrum sensing time and spectrum access time for data transmission. In the spectrum sensing 
period, the transmitter of the CR link shall perform channel sensing to identify whether the link 
is occupied by the PU. If it does, the subsequent data transmission period is unavailable for 
packet transmissions. We assume that the nS, the nD, and the nRs are mobile but stationary during 
each D time intervals, that is, the network topology varys per DΔt. Fig. 1 shows a stationary 
topology during some DΔt. Suppose that there are N possible opportunistic paths between the nS 
and the nD. The set of the N opportunistic paths is denoted as P = {p1, p2,… pN}, where the ith 
opportunistic path pi consists of Ki links, for i = 1, 2,…N. The links number of all opportunistic 
paths are labeled by  = {K1,K2,…KN}. We further assume that Ki is a geometric random 
variable with parameter  and denoted as  (This notation is explained by the fact that a 
geometric random variable is a special case of a negative binomial random variable denoted by 
 [8]), for i = 1, 2,…N. 
 
 
B. Opportunistic Links 
To avoid causing destructive interference to PUs, CR links are mandated to exploit 
temporary spectrum holes for data transmission [1], [9]. DSA can effectively fetch such 
opportunities after successful spectrum sensing. Thus, the transmission opportunity on a CR link 
can be mathematically modeled as a two-state continuous-time Markov chain with the available 
36 
 
  
where V [X] is the variance of random variable X. For M/GI/1 queueing system, we can apply 
Pollaczek-Khinchin (P-K) formula [11] to obtain the average waiting time W of the packets in an 
opportunistic link as 
 
Thus, the statistical delay consisting of serving time and waiting time in an opportunistic link can 
be derived as 
 
2) Delay of an Opportunistic Path: The queueing model of the ith opportunistic path 
consisting of Ki opportunistic links will be derived as a M/Geo/1/∞/FCFS queueing system, 
where Ki is a geometric distribution with parameter . Obviously, the service time of the 
opportunistic path is the geometric sum of geometric random variables and it can be derived as a 
geometric random variable with parameter Δt. By denote  =  as the available of an 
opportunistic path, the service time random variable can be represented as . We assume 
that the random variables of paths are identically distributed, mutually independent, and 
independent of the inter arrival times. By adopting (5), the average delay of the packets in the ith 
opportunistic path  is 
 
for i = 1, 2, …N. 
3) Delay of a Group of Opportunistic Paths with Redundant Transmissions: Please note that 
the queueing model of the ith opportunistic path (M/Geo/1/∞/FCFS) can be represented as 
M/D/1/∞/FCFS with arrival rate , service time Δt, and available probability  = , for i = 
1, 2,…N. Fig. 3 shows us an example. If n opportunistic paths are merged as a group (i.e., 
transmitted with the same session packet flows), similar to (6), the average delay of the packet 
flows via the group can be derived as 
 
where  is the available probability of the group and is obtained by 
38 
 
maximize aggregated bandwidth, we try to maximize the number of group M such that  ≥  
for all j = 1,…,M. We name this maximization problem as MAXG problem and formulate it as 
follows. 
 
We apply a polynomial time transformation in available probability of all opportunistic 
paths and threshold calculations, that is  for i = 1,…,N and . In 
this case, the corresponding function to calculate available probability of a group is defined as 
 
The constraint (14) is modified as 
 
After the above polynomial time transformation, it is easy to observe that MAXG problem 
is equivalent to the bin covering problem [13], where one must pack the items into bins in such a 
way as to maximize the number of bins used, subject to the constraint that each bin be filled to at 
least a given bin size. The threshold  and available probability  , for i = 1,2,…,N are 
analogous to bin and item sizes, respectively. We now prove that MAXG problem is an NP-hard 
problem, based on a polynomial reduction from bin covering, which is known to be strongly 
NP-hard [14]. 
Bin covering Given a finite set U of items, a size 0 ≤ sui≤ 1 for each ui ∈ U (i = 1,…N), a 
positive threshold T. What is the maximum number M such that U can be partitioned into sets 
X1,X2…XM, where each set has total size 
 
and hence can fill a bin to least this threshold. 
Theorem 1. MAXG is a NP-hard problem. 
Proof: We consider the following transformation. Suppose that we find a maximum number of 
40 
 
and m is increased by one. O(1) arithmetic operations are respectively needed to find whether the 
available probability of each opportunistic path exceeds the threshold and to increase the number 
of group. If the availability probability does not exceed, line 7 updates the availability probability 
of current group after adding the current path, which takes O(1) arithmetic operations. At lines 
8-10, if adding current path to current group makes availability probability of current group 
larger than threshold, m is increased by one. As a result, the nS only needs O(N) arithmetic 
operations to complete RR algorithm. 
 
Part II 
As we mentioned above, the throughput provided in every cell has to be high and stable and 
the global trend of environmental protection introduce the concept of green communications to 
keep the power consumption of communication devices as low as possible. In this section, we 
demonstrate possible object functions which could be utilized in resource optimization to achieve 
high and stable throughput while to maintain green communications. We start from the 
maximization of throughput and then consider the case to minimize outage probability. The 
green communications are approached by an objection function to minimize total transmission 
power. Finally, we introduce the utility generalization to support multiple requirements 
simultaneously. 
STABLE HIGH-THROUGHPUT GREEN COMMUNICATIONS 
 
A. Maximization of Throughput 
Considering a cell with one BS utilizing N subcarriers to serve K users, there exists one link 
from BS to every user and thus there are L = K links in the cell. We use n, l and k as subcarrier, 
link and user index, where l = k. In general, to maximize the throughput provided by this BS we 
need to allocate subcarriers among links and to allocate power among subcarriers jointly 
according to CSI of each link. The object function of resource optimization can be formulated as 
follows [7]. 
                 (1) 
In (1), g(pn,Hn,l) is the throughput achieved by subcarrier n under transmission power pn and 
channel gain Hn,l of link l. If AWGN channel is considered, the g(pn,Hn,l) can be formulated as 
g(pn,Hn,l) =  , where N0 is the noise power spectrum density and ζ is system 
dependent constant. The  is the binary subcarrier allocation indicator where  
means subcarrier n is allocated to link l while  means not. As we mentioned, (1) is the 
object function of resource optimization and we would introduce proper constraints to complete 
the optimization formulation in next section. 
 
B. Minimization of Outage Probability 
To maintain stable connections from BS to users, the outage probability of each connection 
42 
 
possible. In this section we consider a scenario similar to section II-A, where one BS utilizing N 
subcarriers to serve K users, and demonstrate we can approach the green communications by the 
object function below [15]. 
                 (6) 
Function (6) is to minimize total transmission power PT by properly allocating data bits 
among subcarriers and subcarriers among links. The cn,l denotes the number of bits loaded to 
subcarrier n of link l, and the function f(cn,l, Hn,l) denote the transmission power required by 
subcarrier n of link l with channel gain Hn,l to transmit cn,l bits. If AWGN channel is considered, 
the function f(cn,l, Hn,l) could be formulated as f(cn,l, Hn,l) = , where N0 is the noise 
power spectrum density and ζ is a constant. Similarly as (1), we introduce constraints to complete 
the optimization in next section. 
 
D. Utility Generalization 
Up to this point, we have demonstrated three object functions each to maximize total 
throughput, to minimize outage probability and to minimize total transmission power. But in 
practical systems we usually have multiple concerns such as to maximize throughput and to 
minimize transmission power simultaneously. The idea of utility [16] [17] provides a feasible 
way to realize such multiple concerns. The principle is to define an utility function U(.) which 
integrate all concerns, such as U(CT , PT) =  for this example, where CT and PT are defined in 
(1) and (6). Therefore, maximizing the utility U(CT , PT) we can have a result with high 
throughput and low transmission power. 
 
In this section, we demonstrate that the inter/intra cell interference can be avoided/relaxed 
by proper Resource management. We start from a network with several BSs share the same 
spectrum to address inter-cell interference, and then consider the case including one BS, relays 
and users to focus on intra-cell interference. For each of the cases we demonstrate possible 
solutions based on existing researches. 
INTRA/INTER-CELL INTERFERENCE CONTROL 
 
A. Inter-cell Interference Control 
Considering an OFDMA networks with M BSs each serves K users by N subcarriers which 
are reused in every cell. Each user has a link from BS and thus for each cell the number of links 
L is equal to the number of users K. We denote the link from BS to user k as l = k and the channel 
gain of the link from BS m to user k on subcarrier n as Hn,l,m. To avoid the inter-cell interference, 
one possible way is to allocate subcarriers among links considering the dominant interference 
from neighboring cells [18]. By characterizing the interference each link perceived as a pair of 
data rate {In,l,m; Sn,l,m}, where In,l,m represents the achievable rate of link l under BS m on 
44 
 
B. Intra-cell Interference Control 
In this subsection we follow the scenario and object functions in section I-A (maximize 
throughput) and I-C (minimize transmission power), but to complete the optimizations by 
integrating constraints to avoid intra-cell interference. We start from the cases that no user can 
relay data for others, and then consider mesh networks with cooperative relay. In the case 
without relay and throughput maximization, the intra-cell interference can be alleviated by a 
constraint to allocate non-overlapping subcarriers to links, which can be formulated as follows 
[7]. 
            (11) 
The object function in (11) is the same as (1) to maximize CT by proper pn and . The 
constraint (ii) is intra-cell interference constraint which requires one subcarrier can be assigned to 
one user only. Since every links transmit on different subcarriers, there is no interference induced. 
The other two constraints are the total power constraint (i) and the proportional fairness 
constraint (iii). The total power constraint limits the sum of transmission power on all subcarriers 
to be less than or equal to PT and the proportional fairness constraint requires certain ratios 
among throughput (Cl) of links, where Cl = . 
On the other hand, if the system try to minimize total transmission power to support green 
communications, we can utilize the object function (6) in section II-C and complete the 
optimization as follows by integrating the intra-cell interference constraint (i). The other 
constraint (ii) is the rate requirement constraint, which requires the number of bits allocated to 
link l should satisfy its rate requirement Rl. 
            (12) 
Then we consider the case that users can relay data for others. In this case, there are K direct 
links from BS to each of the K users and K(K−1) relay links among each pair of users. The 
resulting total number of links is L = K2. We denote the K direct links as link l =1,2,… K while 
the K(K −1) relay links as link l = K +1,K +2,…L2. Since there are several routes from BS to 
each destination user in such mesh networks, allocating subcarriers to links requires the 
knowledge of routing to avoid assigning subcarriers to unused links. But routing needs the 
46 
 
 
 
Although we have demonstrated that each of above challenges of OFDMA mesh networks 
with UFR could be resolved by proper formulations of resource optimization, we need to jointly 
consider all the challenges in practical systems. In this section, we therefore develop a cognitive 
resource management to maximize throughput of overall network and to control inter/intra cell 
interference simultaneously, under considerations on the computation complexity and CSI. The 
concept of “cognitive radio” is introduced that each user identifies the subcarriers un-occupied by 
transmissions in other cells, by the proposed subcarrier identification. Through this example, we 
demonstrate a new resource optimization, feasible for future wireless systems. 
COGNITIVE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT FOR SELF-ORGANIZING OFDMA MESH 
NETWORKS 
 
A. Available Subcarrier Identification 
For a network allowing every BS to reuse total system spectrum without central control, the 
first critical challenge of each BS is to identify the available subcarriers for each link. 
Consequently, we propose a subcarrier identification algorithm for users to determine which 
subcarrier is available and which subcarrier is occupied by transmissions in other cells. We start 
from analyzing the distribution of measured power on available (hypothesis H0) and on occupied 
(hypothesis H1) subcarriers to formulate a hypothesis test, and then discuss the estimation of 
parameters in the test. When one subcarrier is available for one link (H0), it means no 
interference is measured at the frequency of this subcarrier. The measured power p at such 
subcarriers includes only additive noise (i.e. AWGN channel assumption), and thus could be 
48 
 
  (20) 
In (20), the constraint (i) is the total power constraint requiring the sum of transmission 
power of all links and all subcarriers to be smaller than or equal to a maximum PT . The 
constraint (ii) is the intra-cell interference constraint which requires one subcarrier can be 
allocated to one link. The constraint (iii) is the inter-cell interference constraint, where In,l is a 
binary interference index. In,l = 1 means subcarrier n is not available for link l and thus BS should 
not allocate subcarrier n to link l. The constraint (iv) is the network flow conservation constraint, 
which requires the traffic inflow to and outflow from any node in the mesh network should be 
the same, where node-link incidence matrix A and source-sink vector sk are defined as (13) and 
(14). Via this optimization, radio resource in one cell could be optimized to maximize total 
throughput while avoids the intra and inter cell interference. 
 
C. Information Delay Reduction 
As we mentioned, the delay to collect CSI for (20) (i.e. Hn,l and In,l) should be reduced as 
small as possible. In this subsection, we consider the mechanism to reduce the feedback 
delay.Theoretically, for every user there are one direct link from BS and K−1 relay links from 
other users. However, in practical systems one user may not have the capability to receive 
reliable data from all the K−1 relay links, and thus reporting channel conditions of K−1 relay 
links might not be necessary. Therefore, we propose that each user can select only Q relay links 
with best quality to feedback. Via this way, the number of bits each user needs to feedback can 
be reduced from KNbH to (Q+1)NbH, where bH is the number of bit necessarily to represent CSI 
of a subcarrier. We use an example in Fig. 2 (a) to explain this idea. There are three direct links 
among BS and each node, and three pairs of relay links among any two nodes. Without feedback 
control, each node needs to feedback channel conditions of two relay links in addition to the 
direct link. It means node 1 needs to feedback channel conditions of link 5 and link 9 besides link 
1. However, according to the proposed feedback control, node 1 can select one relay link among 
link 5 and link 9 to feedback if Q = 1. In this case, the number of feedback bits can be reduced 
from 3NbH to 2NbH. Therefore, we indeed reduce the feedback delay. 
 
D. Reduced-complexity Algorithm 
Obviously, finding optimal allocation of (20) would consume too much time and thus is 
50 
 
like algorithms possess a large degree of input data parallelism, for which each input data are 
involved in L independent outputs for an L-tap cross correlator. By broadcasting the input data to 
all multipliers and sharing a single operand, we can reduce the memory bandwidth by half while 
still able to execute L operations simultaneously. 
 
B. FFT 
FFT is known in different radix-r representation. We consider the analysis of radix-2 since it 
is able to compute any power of 2 FFT size. Each butterfly operation requires a complex MAC or 
Multiply-SUBtract (MSUB), which is consistent with synchronization algorithms. This allows 
sharing operations and reducing the amount of instructions needed. Another characteristic of FFT 
is the data exchange pattern. Performing parallel processing of each butterfly operation induces 
large amount of data exchange overhead. However, since the exchange mechanism is regular and 
is related to the FFT processing stage, we can tailor the data exchange bus to allow efficient data 
exchange with a PE node 2i−1 away on the ith stage. 
 
C. Channel Estimation 
Most pilots-assisted channel estimation algorithm can be considered as an matrix-vector 
multiplication. For a M × N matrix multiplication, it can be considered as a collection of M 
independent N-tap FIR filter, each with a different set of coefficients and operating on the same 
set of inputs. The M filters can be assigned to M PEs along with the input data being broadcast to 
each PE, which shows an identical mapping with filtering algorithms discussed in section II.A. 
As a result, each PE computes the output locally and eliminates exchange of any temporary 
results. 
 
D. QAM Demapping 
Different than computation-oriented algorithms, QAM demodulation is a control-oriented 
algorithm, which if implemented in software, requires a series of if-else comparison. If-else 
statement interrupts the continuous flow of instruction fetching, which degrades the processing 
capability and is not suitable for a computation-oriented processor. However, we can construct a 
comparison pipe and restrict each data to flow through the same set of comparators (details in 
Section IV. E). By sequentially passing down the comparison results and determining the 
demapping result at the end of the comparator pipe, we are able to convert a control-oriented 
algorithm into a data processing algorithm with a continuous and regular flow of instructions. 
 
E. Viterbi Algorithm 
Error correction code decoding usually contributes the most computation workload in a 
communication system. For a constraint length-k rate m n convolution code, each stage requires 
m + 1 branch metric computation and path metric selection which gives a complexity of O(m · 
2k). To leverage the maximum parallelism, the received codeword can be broadcast to multiple 
PEs and compute the branch metric simultaneously. However, the path metric exchange 
overhead must be minimized. [16] shown that the trellis diagram can be rearranged and 
52 
 
A. Instruction Set 
To reduce the program footprint and allow ease in handoptimizing programs, the instruction 
set extracts the most essential and critical operations in communication algorithms. The overall 
instruction set is listed in TABLE I. We combined often used consecutive operations into a single 
compound instruction (i.e. DIST, SQUARE) which reduces the program footprint. Besides 
compound instructions, several instructions (i.e. BUTFLY, DEMAP) are associated with a global 
state register to create dynamic instructions. This dynamic controlling creates the illusion of 
Multiple-Instruction Multiple-Data (MIMD) processing with a single issued instruction. By limit 
the instruction set to 18 instructions, we provide a programmer friendly processor to allow 
hard-optimizing programs and eliminate a sophisticated compiler in assist. Also, the compact 
instruction set greatly reduces the instruction memory requirement. 
 
 
B. Processing element 
Fig. 2 depicts the functional block of a single PE. Each PE incorporates a local instruction 
decoder and a register file. The local instruction decoder combines the issued instruction, PE ID, 
and the butterfly stage register to generate the required control signals for dynamic controlling. 
Each PE incorporates four 16-bit multipliers, five 32-bit adders, and a barrel shifter to allow 
complex operations be computed within a single cycle. All operations are computed with no 
precision loss and scaled down only at the ”Shift L/R Stage” for each instruction. All PEs are 
linearly connected to form a 1D PE array along with two separate data channels to enable 
bi-directional data flow with adjacent PEs. Without sacrificing computation time for data 
communication, each data exchange can be overlapped with data processing. Data generated by 
adjacent PEs are also able to be directly fetched into computation, which couples the nearby PEs 
to form an efficient parallel processing unit. This allows data generated by adjacent PEs to 
bypass RF access and thus reducing the amount of power consumption. 
54 
 
communication algorithms. It eliminates the need of a power hungry wide data bus and balance 
the tradeoff between flexibility and efficiency by identifying the necessary needs of the target 
application. 
 
 
We demonstrate the mapping of several widely applied communication algorithms and 
illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed communication processor. The mapping demonstrates 
how data broadcast bus exploits the parallelism inherited in algorithms. The PE controller 
provides just enough flexibility to reconfigure between multiple communication kernels and 
systems without involving a sophisticated controlling mechanism. 
MAPPING OF ALGORITHMS 
 
A. FIR filter 
Fig. 4 illustrates the mapping of a 6-tap FIR filter. The mapping mimics the implementation 
in dedicated circuits, which simultaneously computes all operations related to the input data at 
once. Each PE receives the MAC instruction broadcast by the PE controller and fetches a 
different set of data. The consistent operations of each PE confirms the effectiveness of the PE 
controller, which compacts the controlling mechanism to take advantage of the algorithm’s 
regularity. 
 
 
B. FFT 
Our proposed processor can compute any power of 2 FFT. However, the processing time is 
strongly related to the amount of PEs. A maximum processing speed is achieved when the PE 
amount matches the FFT size. For simplicity of illustration, we only demonstrate the mapping of 
an 8-point FFT. With proper ordering of data, one single BUTFLY instruction is capable to 
perform one stage of FFT processing. The BUTFLY is an compound instruction which acts 
56 
 
 
 
E. QAM demapping 
QAM demapping requires partitioning the signal constellation space into several decision 
regions. Our proposed processor is able to construct a chain of decision boundary comparators 
and perform QAM demodulation ranging from BPSK up to 64-QAM. For the simplicity of 
illustration, we only discuss the demapping of QPSK, which is shown in Fig. 7. The DEMAP 
instruction utilizes the butterfly stage register to store signal constellation size and direct each PE 
to perform different operations. Masking the PE ID creates a 2-bit control field to distinguish the 
three different operations - real axis comparison, imaginal axis comparison, and result extraction. 
The PE controller broadcast the DEMAP instruction and each PE compares the input data with 
the constellation boundary value. If the input data is greater, the demapped result and a 1-bit data 
is generated and sequentially passed down. The last PE aggregates each result and utilizes the 
butterfly stage register value to determine the number of decoded bits. 
 
 
F. Reconfigure Between Multi-systems 
Fast reconfiguration between multiple systems is required to support DSA. We minimized 
the hard controls in our processor to allow fast reconfiguration by simply reloading several 
control registers. 
Two level of reconfiguration is involved: parameter reconfiguration or system 
58 
 
 
 
 
Part II 
Hereafter, we demonstrate performance of the proposed subcarrier identification algorithm 
and the proposed reduced-complexity resource allocation algorithm. We first show the missing 
probability (PM) and the false alarm probability (PF ) of the test (18) in Fig. 4, where PM 
represents the possibility that one subcarrier is occupied but identified as available while PF 
represents the possibility that one subcarrier is available but identified as occupied. Both 
represent erroneous conditions in identification. Obviously, both of the PM and PF in Fig. 4 are 
far below 10−5 with the threshold generated by Lloyd-Max Algorithm. Then we demonstrate 
performance of the proposed reduced-complexity algorithm 1 for (20) in Fig. 5, with optimal 
allocation as comparison. We use FDMA-OFDM which divides subcarriers into several sets and 
allocate one set to one link fixedly as benchmark. From Fig. 5, we can observe the proposed 
algorithm can approach optimal performance and significantly improve throughput from 
benchmark. The second step of proposed algorithm is to integrate relay, and could improve 
slightly performance from the first step without relay. Due to the proposed reduced-overhead 
60

several different architectures. Since each architecture are implemented in different CMOS 
process technology, we normalize all the data to 0.13μm technology by assuming a 1/s2 reduction 
in area and a 1/s2 reduction in power consumption. As shown in table IV, our approach delivered 
a much smaller area and more power-efficient (green) design comparing to other previous works. 
The comparison of 40-tap FIR filter and 64-point FFT shows that we successfully exploit the 
critical parallelism in communication algorithm, and tailored the processor architecture to strike a 
balance among several performance metrics.

Part I 
This report proposes a statistical control mechanism which chooses multiple opportunistic 
paths (each opportunistic path consists of opportunistic links) as a group to transmit packet flows 
such that the statistical delay of this group is restricted to be lower than a target threshold. We 
further propose an algorithm to partition all possible opportunistic paths into several groups so

IV. COOPERATIVE NETWORKING TECHNIQUES 
SUPPORTING MULTICAST AND BROADCAST SERVICES FOR 4G 
SYSTEM 
IV.1 Introduction 
IEEE 802.16提出的群播與廣播服務(Multicast and Broadcast Service, MBS)概念與 3GPP 
LTE提出的多媒體群播與廣播服務(Multimedia Broadcast and Multicast Service, MBMS)相
同，是第四代(4G)無線通訊系統中重要的服務技術之一。 
大致上來說，若要傳送行動多媒體服務[1]給多個使用者，主要有單播(unicast)、廣播
(broadcast)、群播(multicast)，分別如圖 1-1、圖 1-2、圖 1-3 這三種傳送形式。單播傳送的
特性是在網路與多個使用者間建立相互獨立的點對點傳輸通道進行傳送，但傳送相同資料
給多個使用者時，因為需要個別傳送，所以會耗費較多的頻寬。廣播傳送的特性是在網路
與多個使用者間建立共同的點對多點通道進行傳送，所有使用者都可接收到資料。群播傳
送的特性是在網路與各個群組間建立共同的點對多點通道進行傳送，與廣播不同的是，群
播只針對訂閱服務的使用者群組進行傳送。

體網路效能的提升，進行整體網路服務架構的選擇。為了計算整體網路的效能，本研究從
只討論單一基地台涵蓋範圍的服務架構，提出探討整個網路服務架構的服務架構模式，服
務架構模式的概念是將四種服務架構，以結合的方式應用在整體網路的傳輸方式上。以下
為幾種較常出現的服務架構模式，第一種服務架構模式為 All SC-PTM，如圖 1-4所示，整
體網路都以 SC-PTM 的方式進行傳送；第二種服務架構模式為 Relay-enabled SC-PTM + 
SC-PTM，整體網路以 Relay-enabled SC-PTM結合 SC-PTM的方式進行傳送，圖 1-5為其
中一種結合方式；第三種服務架構模式為 SFN + SC-PTM，如圖 1-6所示，整體網路以 SFN
結合 SC-PTM的方式進行傳送；第四種服務架構模式為 Relay-enabled SFN + SC-PTM，如
圖 1-7所示，整體網路以 Relay-enabled SFN結合 SC-PTM的方式進行傳送。

目前所考慮會影響服務架構模式選擇的環境參數為各個基地台涵蓋範圍內的使用者
個數。而在本研究中，各個基地台服務架構選擇的執行方式，主要是比較在不同的涵蓋範
圍比例以及不同的使用者分佈數量情況，各種服務架構模式下平均每個 cell 的平均消息量
與平均頻譜使用效率，選定適合整體網路的服務架構模式後，再決定各個 cell 合適的服務
架構。 
 
IV.2 Literature Survey 
對於群播與廣播服務，3GPP在 RAN1工作群組提出六種傳輸技術[10]，透過實際的效
能評估，可知道不同的傳輸技術適用於不同的使用者個數分佈情形。以下針對與本篇傳輸
架構相關的三種技術進行說明： 
 技術一：一般無線點對點傳送 
 技術二：群播與廣播單頻網軟結合傳送（soft combining） 
 技術六：單蜂巢式點對多點傳送-使用者提供上行通道品質參數以及確認與非確認訊
息回報 
76 
 
參考上述利用消息量來選擇中繼站類型的方式，我們依照單蜂巢點對多點、單頻網、
單蜂巢點對多點中繼傳輸、單頻網中繼傳輸等服務架構的傳輸方式來推導出以上各種服務
架構的消息量公式，再藉由代入所需的參數後比較各服務架構下的消息量來選擇適當的服
務架構。這篇不適用於本研究的原因是這篇只討論中繼傳輸的消息量，本篇研究是要探討
各種服務架構的消息量 
由於群播與廣播單頻網在傳送上強調傳送同步，所以在計算群播與廣播單頻網的接收
訊號強度上，[6]提出了計算訊號對干擾雜訊比的方式。在同步的情況下傳送，會因為多重
路徑延遲的影響，如圖 1-8，導致使用者接收到信號時間不同，運用 OFDMA 的方式進行
傳送，參考[14]當同步傳送的訊號在預設的循環字首(cyclic prefix, CP)時間內接收時，都視
為建設性訊號，如圖 1-9，反之在預設的 CP時間外所接收到的訊號，則當成干擾訊號。而
建設性訊號是將原訊號乘上一權重值 ( )ω τ ，如式 1-4 所示，若傳輸延遲時間(τ )小於或等
於預設的循環字首時間(Tcp )，則權重值為 1，若輸延遲時間大於預設的循環字首時間，則
先將傳輸延遲時間減去預設的循環字首時間，再除上有用的訊框時間(Tu )，再用 1減去上
述的結果，即為該情況下的權重值。

將上述的權重值代入式 1-5 的訊號對干擾雜訊比公式中，即為使用者在群播與廣播單
頻網下可接收到的訊號強度。其中 N代表加入單頻網的基地台個數，M代表多重路徑的通
道個數，而 ( )i mτ 和 jδ 則分別為第 i個基地台到使用者的傳輸延遲以及多重路徑影響中第 j
78 
 
本研究討論在 WiMAX 系統下的群播與廣播服務環境，網路拓樸如圖 3-1 所示。
ASN-GW負責底下所有基地台服務架構的選擇，而各種服務架構的佈建情況都不相同，在
啟用 SC-PTM的環境下，除了主要提供服務的中心基地台為建設性訊號，其餘接收訊號都
視為干擾訊號，而在 SFN環境下，單頻網內所有基地台訊號對使用者都視為建設性訊號，
其餘接收訊號對使用者而言則視為干擾訊號。若啟用中繼傳輸的架構時，則 Relay-enabled 
SC-PTM 需考慮涵蓋範圍內中繼站傳輸所帶來的訊號增益，以及周圍其他傳送訊號干擾的
影響，而 Relay-enabled SFN基於涵蓋範圍內所有傳送方式需相同且同步，所以涵蓋範圍內
的所有中繼站都需同時啟用，增加區域內的訊號接收增益。 
本研究的假設條件如下： 
使用者是均勻分佈在基地台涵蓋範圍內； 
基地台傳輸天線為全向性天線(Omni Antenna)； 
所有中繼站都能成功解調並進行轉送，不需重傳；

IV.3.2 Formation of Multicast and Broadcast Service Architecture Selection 
Mechanism 
根據上述的系統環境與假設，須提出方法用來選擇各個 cell適合的MBS架構，值得注
意的是，服務架構的選擇不能只單看單一基地台涵蓋範圍的效能提升與否，要考慮的是整
體網路的效能提升，所以本篇提出之研究目的為服務架構模式的概念來估計整體網路效
能。基於上述原因，本研究需要計算整體網路效能的方法，關於整體網路效能的計算，本
研究有兩種計算方式，第一種是參考[12-13]的觀念，利用消息量計算通道容量，藉由估計
各種服務架構模式下每個 cell 的平均最大傳輸速率來判斷適合整體網路的服務架構模式；
第二種是透過計算各服務架構模式下每個 cell 的平均頻譜使用效率來選擇適合整體網路的
服務架構模式。 
要計算整體網路的效能，首先要知道各個 cell 的效能為何，由於每個 cell 內的使用者
都為均勻分佈，所以必須針對每個 cell 進行平均效能的計算。而原先計算平均消息量與平
均頻譜使用效率的方式是實際模擬使用者散佈在 cell 內的各種情況，取得基地台與最遠使
用者間的距離訊息，讓後端的 ASN-GW透過此距離訊息，代入本篇提供的各種服務架構消
息量公式或是頻譜使用效率公式進行統計平均，求得平均消息量或平均頻譜使用效率。不
過使用這種方式求得平均消息量或平均頻譜使用效率，在執行上較為複雜，所以本研究提
出一個機率公式，讓系統依據使用者人數，就可以準確估計各種服務架構下的平均消息量。 
另一方面，本研究採取在 SFN與 Relay-enabled SFN這兩種服務架構下，使用單頻網
涵蓋範圍邊界與單頻網內各基地台和各中繼站間的距離，作為效能計算依據的方式，確保
涵蓋範圍內的所有使用者，都能滿足其服務品質。

在 SFN與 Relay-enabled SFN服務架構下，其效能只會與涵蓋範圍邊界與各基地台以
及各中繼站之間的距離有關；而在 SC-PTM與 Relay-enabled SC-PTM服務架構下，平均消
息量與平均頻譜使用效率會與使用者的分佈有關，在 MBS 環境下，必須讓位於涵蓋範圍
內所有使用者的 BLER 都低於 1%，因此，必須先求出不同的使用者分佈條件下的效能，
再根據各種分佈條件的發生機率來算出平均效能。為了求得各種使用者分佈條件的發生機
率，本研究提出了一個機率公式，在使用者均勻分佈(uniform distribution)的假設前提下，
可以估計不同涵蓋範圍內，離基地台最遠使用者位於任一距離的機率。藉由此公式，我們
可以在 ASN-GW直接去計算不同使用者個數在 SC-PTM與 Relay-enabled SC-PTM服務架
構機制下的平均效能。 
       以下為使用者最遠距離機率公式的推導過程，首先針對基地台涵蓋範圍內，離基地

IV.4.2 Average Spectrum Utilization Efficiency Algorithm of Service 
Architectures 
本節介紹本篇提出的第二種服務架構選擇演算法，利用推導出的服務架構平均頻譜使
用效率公式計算出各個 cell 的平均頻譜使用效率，本演算法主要由服務架構頻譜使用效率
公式結合 4.1.2節的最遠使用者分佈各距離機率所形成。以下先從各服務架構的頻譜使用效
率公式介紹起，再說明各服務架構的平均頻譜使用效率公式。 
IV.4.2.1 Formulation of Spectrum Utilization Efficiency of Service Architectures 
在計算群播與廣播服務架構下的頻譜使用效率時，影響計算結果的主要原因是每個
symbol所能傳送的 bits數，而每個 symbol所能傳送的 bits數，是由使用者接收到的 SINR
值對照到適當的 MCS level所決定[18]，如式 4-19所示，其中 ( )levelMCS 可將使用者接收
到的 SINR對應到MCS table，如表 4-1所示，依照所限制之錯誤率選擇適當的MCS level，
再決定每個 symbol傳送的 bits數。

V.1.2 Cooperative Cognitive Radio Network 
Cooperative communication is a classic issue in wireless network [13], which is also 
discussed in cognitive radio [8]. Simeone et al. introduced a cooperative scheme among primary 
and secondary users [14] called Cognitive Relay approach, which intends to enhance the 
throughput of primary users and at the same time to conserve the transmission opportunities of 
secondary users. A secondary transmitter may help relaying primary users' packets if the 
transmission is detected to be failed. With Cognitive Relay, primary users can prevent 
unnecessary retransmission, and secondary users can improve their transmission opportunities 
without drawing primary users' attention. Extended from [14], Simeone et al. design a 
cooperative secondary ad hoc network based on the idea of Cognitive Relay [15]. The relay 
process is controlled by the primary user who chooses the length of time in different states and 
the relay set of the secondary users. The design is investigated through a Stackelberg game model 
and focus on the primary users' strategies to maximize its throughput. A similar idea is illustrated 
by Mietzner et al. in [10], which considerers a CDMA based Ultra-WideBand cognitive radio 
system with multiple secondary users and a two-stage relay design. The authors formulate the 
problem as a system optimization problem and propose a distributed power allocation algorithm. 
Zhang et al. formulate a price-based Stackelberg Game model for cooperative cognitive radio 
networks [19]. Primary users sell part of their transmission time to secondary users. In return, 
secondary users help relay their data cooperatively. They discussed how the primary users 
maximize the utility by adjusting the given transmission time and the required relay time. 
Different from the simultaneous relay scheme in [15][19], Lu et al. investigate a opportunistic 
relay scheme in IEEE 802.11 WLAN network [9]. They discuss various issues in the 
implementation of the random access MAC relay scheme such as estimating link quality, relay 
selection, and fairness. Their work shows that a random access MAC relay scheme indeed 
enhances the network performance. 
Following our previous work [1], our goal is to create a generalized cooperative scenario 
among primary and secondary users in contention-based cognitive radio of interweave approach. 
We propose a new cooperative relay scheme called Cognitive-Enhanced Secondary-Assisted 
Relay (CESAR) mechanism to enhance the performance of contention-based cognitive radio 
networks. CESAR mechanism provides the coordination scheme between multiple secondary 
relay users. We also discuss the impact of different relay node selection schemes in CESAR 
mechanism. First, we present a general CESAR mechanism for cognitive radio network in 
Section 2. Then, we propose centralized Mandatory Forwarding (CESAR-MF) and Error 
Minimization (CESAR-EM) modes for CESAR mechanism in Section 3. 
The research of conventional centralized-control relay strategy aims to optimize the 
overall system performance. However, this type of system-optimized strategies may not be 
106 
 
the individual rationality issue in a battery constrained network. Our simulations results 
verify that CESAR mechanisms enhance the system performance.  
 
V.2 System Model 
We consider a contention-based cognitive radio network with one primary sender , one 
primary receiver , and multiple secondary users . The reason to choose only one 
primary user in our model is that when a primary packet fails, only those secondary users near 
him are involved in the relay scheme while other primary users just ignore the failure. We 
assume there is no hidden terminal problem, i.e, secondary users are close enough to sense any 
transmission in the network. For the primary user pair, the packet error rate (PER) from  to  
is denoted by , which is affected by the coding scheme, channel gains, and interference. As for 
secondary users, the PER from  to  is denoted by  for , which is fluctuating 
due to spatially diverse channel qualities and gains. Secondary user  can calculate  by 
measuring the SNR of the overheard acknowledgment packets from . The transmission time in 
our system model is slotted. We assume 's traffic scenario is constant-bit-rate (CBR) with 
packet time interval . Every data packet from primary and secondary users requires exactly 
one slot transmission time. 
 
   
Figure  1: System Model 
 
As a primary user in cognitive radio network,  has the right to access the channel 
without any interference from secondary users. Secondary users have the right to access the 
channel only when there is no active primary user. In our system, the only chance secondary 
users have to access the channel is the successive slots after  receives the data from  
successfully. In this case, secondary users can use the rest of the time slots to transmit until  
has another CBR packet for transmission and occupies the channel. An illustration to our system 
108 
 
   
Figure  2: CESAR Mechanism 
  
If the recovery of packet transmission fails, all users in  will retry 
repeatedly until  successfully receive the packet, and the failed transmission is recovered. For 
a given relay set , the average PER  of primary packet conditioned on a failure 
transmission from the primary user, and the expected value of relay time  are given by  
  
All secondary users are only allowed to transmit in the remaining time slots . 
The longer the relay time, the shorter the secondary users' transmission time. As for secondary 
users with good channel qualities, there is a chance that they can reduce the relay time and 
increase the transmission time by joining the relay set. However, for those with bad channel 
qualities, their relays may increase the average PER along with the expected relay time, which 
results in shorter transmission time for all secondary users. Hence, the key element in CESAR 
mechanism is the choice of relay set . We first discuss two centralized CESAR modes, each 
with their choices of relay set . 
 
V.3.1 Mandatory Forwarding mode (CESAR-MF) 
First we propose a simple mode called Mandatory Forwarding mode (CESAR-MF). We 
include all users into the relay set , and the average PER of primary packet in 
CESAR-MF mode is given by:  
  
CESAR-MF simply mandates all secondary users to join the relay set , which guarantees the 
fairness among secondary users and excludes the presence of free-rider. However, the average 
PER  in CESAR-MF mode may be higher than  when many secondary users suffer 
from poor channel qualities. When , CESAR-MF mode leads to higher average 
110 
 
CESAR-EM mode. However, some users like  may face a higher battery consumption 
 instead of , and . According to its optimization program, it 
will refuse to join the relay set , and thereby causing the CESAR-EM to fail. As a result, in 
order to create an effective distributed wireless network, we need to put the individual rationality 
issue into consideration when design CESAR mechanism modes. 
On the basis of the observations above, we formulate the behaviors of distributed 
secondary users in the proposed CESAR Game model. Our game-theoretical model is a Nash 
Equilibrium-based model. We define the players as all secondary users , each with an 
action . We define the action space of  as , and . Additionally, 
we define the action profile of all players other than  as . We assume all players adopt 
pure strategies, and each player's strategy space is the same as their action space. The strategy the 
players adopt are defined as the function of network information: they will choose not to relay 
unless it is more beneficial for themselves to relay. Third, we use the concept of "profit/cost" to 
define the utility of player . For every successful transmission of 's own data, its utility 
pluses , which refers to the profit of a successful data transmission. For every transmission 
(including relay), the utility minus , which refers to the cost of using battery power for each 
transmission. We define the number of 's own successful data transmission as , and the 
number of 's total transmission (including relay) as . Then, the utility function of  can be 
described as  
  
 The major difference between our utility function and the one in [19] is that our model 
formulation and mechanisms do not include any payment-related process. Instead,  is 
denoted as the data/battery ratio to characterize different types of secondary users. A network 
with high data/battery ratio secondary users can be considered as a network of no battery 
constrained because users care scarcely about battery consumption. In contrast, a network with 
low data/battery ratio users is a battery constrained network. 
For , its utility  is not only decided by its own strategy but also has a relation with 
other users' strategies. Given other users' strategies , we can define the best response 
 of :  
 
 
 For a system with  secondary users, there are  possible strategy profiles. We are only 
interested in one type of strategy profiles called Nash Equilibrium, where every player's current 
112 
 
 
  (2) 
 We define  as the threshold of , whether 
 roughly represents the average packet success rate of . With Eq. (2) and 
, we can write down the best response function of :  
  (3) 
 
In the game-theoretical model, the existence of Nash Equilibrium is an important issue 
because it is related to the stability of the system. In CESAR-AM, it has been proved in [1] that 
when all secondary users's  ratios are equal, there exists a unique Nash Equilibrium relay 
set . 
In terms of various  ratios, our simulations shows that there always exists at least 
one Nash Equilibrium, and the users who join  mostly have lower PER as well as higher 
 ratio. 
 
V.5.2 Proposed Algorithm for CESAR-AM 
Based on previous discussion, we know the expected value of  depends on whether 
they relay or not. If it is more beneficial for a user to choose to relay ( ), it will join , 
and vice versa. However, their decisions influence other users' strategies as the threshold is tied 
to the number of users and the average PER in . The organization among the users requires a 
complex design of centralized algorithm design to solve. A distributed algorithm is considered 
more feasible to solve the problem. 
The idea of the proposed algorithm is forcing all users to make their choices by rounds. 
First, we assume all users have the knowledge of the average PER  and the choices of other 
users in the last round. The average PER can be measured by observing primary transmission 
process. Then, they choose their best response based on the set  and average PER  in the last 
round. Afterwards, the users check if they want to reverse their choices in the last round. Users 
repeat this process until all of them remain the same choices they make in the last round, and 
then a Nash Equilibrium is reached. However, we are unable to guarantee that the termination 
condition of our algorithm is always satisfied. In some network scenarios, numerous of users 
114 
 
V.6 CESAR Incentive Mode (CESAR-IM) 
In the discussion of Eq. (2), we observe that the issue of individual rationality in 
CESAR-AM is raised when  is low and  is large. When there are many users, the 
transmission time for each user is small. No users can recover their battery consumption with the 
increased transmission time when they choose to join relay set , which may lead to poor 
network performance. Another individual rationality issue of CESAR-AM is that it is not 
applicable to battery constrained networks, namely, users have small data/battery ratio. Because 
the consumption of battery is too costly for the user to use additional battery on relay process, no 
secondary users will join the relay set in CESAR-AM. To deal with the individual rationality 
issues, we design the Incentive mode for CESAR mechanism (CESAR-IM) to solve this problem. 
The major issue of CESAR-AM is that the users in  have to share the benefits they gain with 
other users, resulting in an unfair situation. Therefore, we apply an additional rule to reward the 
user who successfully relays the data to : When a secondary user in  successfully relay 
the data, it has the priority to transmit its own data in the next time slot. We will see how this rule 
affects the behaviors of secondary users. First of all, we define the user who contends 
successfully in the relay process as . For a secondary user  in , following three cases 
have to be considered. 
Case 1: : The probability that  contends successfully is . 
 has the priority to transmit in the successive slot, so its expected transmission time is 
. 
Case 2: : The probability that  contends successfully is . 
None has the priority to transmit in the successive slot, so the expected transmission time of  
is . 
Case 3: :  has the priority to transmit in the first successive slot, so the 
expected transmission time of  is . 
Integrating the equations above, we can derive the utility function of  when it is with 
relay action:  
 
 
  
116 
 
their best response, and a unique Nash Equilibrium is constructed. A relay set  is uniquely 
constructed in the Nash Equilibrium:  
  
 
V.6.2 Proposed Algorithm for CESAR-IM 
As we have mentioned in Theorem 1, users have their dominant strategies regardless of 
the information about the average PER and the number of users in . Therefore, it is quite 
simple to derive the Nash Equilibrium by checking if their s satisfy Eq. (4). If  
satisfies the threshold, its dominant strategy is to relay, otherwise is not to relay. Because the 
strategy  adopts is not affected by the strategies of others, all users only need to check once. 
Finally, we summarize the proposed CESAR modes. In Mandatory Forwarding mode (MF), all 
secondary users are forced to relay the primary user's packets. Error Minimization mode (EM) 
chooses the secondary users with good channel qualities to minimize the primary user's PER. 
Altruistic mode (AM) reaches the optimal throughput under the constraints of secondary users' 
individual rationalities, and Incentive mode (IM) applies an incentive design to reduce the 
drawback of individual rationality in a battery constrained network.  
 
V.7 Simulation Results 
We compare the performance of Altruistic mode and Incentive mode in different network 
scenarios. We set up two networks, one with data/battery ratio within , the other within 
, and apply the same traffic settings as the previous simulations. The former case 
represents a cognitive radio network with battery constrained, and the latter without battery 
constrained. We compare three scenarios with each other: Error Minimization mode 
(CESAR-EM), Altruistic mode (CESAR-AM), and Incentive mode (CESAR-IM). CESAR-EM is 
considered as a benchmark of centralized optimal scenario without concerning individual 
rationality. We use the aggregated throughput of all secondary users as the performance metrics, 
and adjust the primary error rate from  to .

VI. ADAPTIVE COOPERATION WITH CROSS PHY- AND 
MAC-LAYER OPTIMIZATION FOR 4G WIRELESS NETWORKS 
    In traditional wireless networks, communicating devices ``talk`` to each other directly over 
a wireless link. In order to improve link quality, each device may use multiple antennas (e.g., 
multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)) and obtain the so-called spatial diversity gain. However, 
the MIMO technology could be expensive to simple portable devices in terms of hardware 
complexity and power consumption.  Cooperative transmission resolves this issue by 
introducing third-party ``relay" devices. The relay devices act as virtual antennas for the 
communicating devices and thus, provide the same spatial diversity as the MIMO technology 
without use of multiple antennas. 
To make best use of cooperative transmission, participating devices --- including the source, 
destination and relay(s) --- must  (1) exchange link-quality information and then (2) adapt the 
cooperation strategy to the ever-changing wireless environment.  In this project, a 
reservation-based signaling mechanism based on ECMA-368 standard has been developed. 
ECMA-386 standard specifies a MAC protocol that is fully distributed. Devices exchange 
beacons in the beacon period (BP) of a superframe as shown in Figure 1. Based on the received 
beacons, a source device can estimate the signal-to-noise (SNR) of the link between itself and the 
destination device. If the SNR does not suffice to provide required link budget, the source and 
destination devices may consider to invoke cooperation with some relay device(s) for data 
transmission in the DTP.   
Selection of a good relay device is crucial for effective cooperation. A good relay is usually 
a common neighbor of the source and destination devices. Therefore, identifying the common 
neighbors is the first step toward cooperative transmission. According to ECMA-386 standard, a 
device includes a Beacon Period Occupancy Information Element (BPOIE) in every transmitted 
beacon. BPOIE provides the identification (i.e., the MAC address) of a device's neighbors from 
which the beacons are received. Since every device includes a BPOIE in its beacon, a source 
device can learn the neighbors of the destination device simply based on the beacon received 
from the destination device. Therefore, the source and destination devices can identify their 
common neighbor(s) at the end of the BP in every superframe.  
 
124 
 
and reception power consumed by the relay during the cooperative transmission, it is very 
difficult to justify the use of cooperative transmission. In what follows, we present our results 
regarding spatial reuse and power consumption in cooperative transmission. 
 
Figure 2: Cooperative Transmission using DRP 
 
VI.1 Spatial Reuse in Cooperative Transmission 
In direct transmission, devices that are in the coverage of the source and the destination 
devices must keep silent. Refer the union of the coverage of the source and destination devices to 
as the quiet zone. One can derive the average size of the quiet zone established by a 
communicating pair with a transmission range of r. Let d be the distance between the source and 
destination devices of the communicating pair. We have d < r as illustrated in Figure 3. 
 
Figure 3: Quiet zone of a direct communicating pair 
Let E2(d) be the conditional average size of the quiet zone given that distance between the 
source and destination is d. We have 
  
Now assume that the source and destination are uniformly distributed in a given area. The 
pdf of d can be obtained as

126 
 
VI.2 Power Consumption in Cooperative Transmission 
The performance gain of the communicating pair using cooperation, say throughput, is 
obtained with the expense of the relay's power consumption. Therefore, when one claims that 
cooperative transmission achieves a higher throughput than direct transmission, we should be 
careful that the same energy or power is used by these transmission schemes for fair comparison. 
However, there are various ways of considering power consumption. In this project, we consider 
three different metrics of power ``efficiency".   
 
Metric 1: Energy per transmitted bit 
This is a very common metric used in the physical (PHY) layer. After all, if two transmitters 
use the same amount of energy to transmit a bit, whoever provides the higher throughput should 
be a better transmitter. Table I compares the throughputs of two transmitters based on such a 
metric.  Here, transmitter 1 and transmitter 2 both transmit 150 bits and use 100 Joule in total. 
According to Metric 1, the two transmitters are the same in terms of power consumption. 
Therefore, transmitter 2 is better given that it achieves a higher throughput (21 bps vs. 10 bps). 
One can argue that transmitter 2 simply spends a higher power and squeezes more bits per 
symbol in order to transmit the same amount of data bits as transmitter 1 to the receiver in a 
shorter time period. However, in a long run, transmitter 2 spends twice the total energy as 
transmitter 1. Therefore, it is hard to argue that it is a better transmitter in terms of throughput.

                           (* The bit error rate is higher given a smaller symbol energy compared to Table I)  
 
Table II: Energy per successfully-received bit 
According to Metric 2, transmitter 2 is still better given that it still achieves a higher 
throughput (15bps vs. 10bps) with the same power consumption (1 joule per successful bit). 
However, one can argue that transmitter 2 just spends a higher power and squeezes more bits per 
symbol in order to transmit successfully the same amount of data bits as transmitter 1 to the 
receiver. As in the previous case, transmitter 2 achieves the higher throughput with higher power 
consumption in a long run.                                                                                                                                
 
Metric 3: Average Power 
Finally, we only consider the average power spent by a device in a long run. The power or 
energy spent in the bit level (or PHY layer) is not of our interest. Table III compares the 
throughput of two transmitters based on such a power metric.

In a 2-hop transmission, the data frame is first transmitted by the source device to the relay 
with the receiver MAC address set to the relay's MAC address. Therefore, only the relay will 
attempt to receive the data from the source device. If the relay successfully decodes the frame, 
the frame is then forwarded to the destination with the receiver MAC address set to the 
destination device's MAC address. Therefore, there are at least two transmissions and 2 
receptions in a successful 2-hop transmission. The average power consumption in 2-hop 
transmission, P2-hop, is derived as follows. 
P2-hop =               (5) 
The throughput in 2-hop transmission, T2-hop, is derived as follows. 
T2-hop =                            (6)

VI.4 Throughput comparison of different transmission schemes 
(a) Direct transmission 
We first consider direct transmission where the distance between S-D link is 2. The figure 
below shows the throughput at the receiver, with and without considering the receiving power 
consumption. The X-axis represents the total power consumed during the direct transmission, 
while the Y-axis represents the normalized throughput (normalized by the symbol rate). Adaptive 
modulation is applied in each transmission. That is, the source device chooses a modulation 
scheme from BPSK, QPSK and 16QAM, and so does the relay, depending on the SNR of the 
wireless links. One can find that when considering the receiving power at the destination device, 
the achievable throughput is reduced by 53 % at worst. At any rate, when the total power is large 
enough, using direct transmission can achieve the theoretical throughput of 2 (given that the code 
rate is 1/2 and 16QAM (4 bits/symbol) is used when the total power is very high).

134 
 
 
Figure 7: Cooperative transmission with and without considering receiving power 
 
Based on the above numerical results, one can find that the receiving power plays a more 
important role in 2-hop transmission and cooperative transmission than in direct transmission. 
There are 93% and 91% reduction of the achievable throughput in 2-hop and cooperative 
transmission, respectively, while there is only 53% reduction of achievable throughput in direct 
transmission. We believe that such difference in throughput reduction results mainly from that 
there are 1, 2 and 3 receptions in direct, 2-hop and cooperative transmission, respectively. 
Therefore, it is very important to include the receiving power in the performance evaluation. 
Otherwise, the improvement of cooperative transmission may be enlarged. 
 
(d) Comparison 
Finally, we compare the throughput under the three transmission schemes with the 
consideration of receiving power. From the aforementioned illustration, direct transmission has a 
higher achievable throughput than 2-hop and cooperative transmissions when the total power is 
large enough. This is mainly because that the source and relay devices can only use 16QAM, 
even that the link quality is very high in the case of 2-hop transmission and cooperative 
transmission.  
However, both 2-hop and cooperative transmission perform better than direct transmission 
in the region of average power from 3 to 6. In this region, direct transmission cannot use a higher 
modulation level. For example, 16QAM (4 bits/symbol) has a higher modulation level than 
BPSK (1 bit/symbol). When using a higher modulation level at a certain level of total power 
consumption, one should take the risk of facing a higher frame error rate (FER). Nevertheless, 
2-hop transmission can deal with this problem through transmitting data in a shorter distance (i.e., 
a better link quality). Cooperative transmission gets the benefit from the so called “diversity (i.e., 
reception of the same information)”, so the FER at the receiver can be reduced.

is bad comparatively. Accordingly, the source can use a higher level of modulation scheme, while 
the relay should use a lower level of modulation scheme. From the destination’s perspective, it 
may get a low-SNR frame from the source and a comparatively a high-SNR frame from the relay 
when cooperative transmission is applied. However, the destination may only get a relatively 
better data frame from the relay when 2-hop transmission is applied. 
However, 2-hop transmission performs better than cooperative transmission in this case, 
because 2-hop transmission has requires two receptions per transmission, while cooperative 
transmission has three receptions. Receiving a data frame usually requires the same level of 
power (if not more) as transmitting a data frame. Direct transmission performs better when the 
average power is large enough, because it only uses one phase to transmit data frames. 
 
(b) Asymmetric topology: The relay is closer to the destination. 
 
Figure 10: Throughput comparison in asymmetric topology: The relay is closer to the destination. 
 
The distances between S-D link, S-R link and R-D link are 2, 1.5 and 0.5, respectively. The 
X-axis represents the total power consumed during the cooperative transmission, while the Y-axis 
represents the normalized throughput (normalized by the symbol rate). The adaptive modulation 
is applied in each transmission.  
In this topology, the relay is closer to the destination. The S-D and S-R links are not good 
enough, so the source should apply a lower level of modulation scheme to transmit data frame 
when the average power is not large enough. However, since the R-D link is quite good, the relay 
can use a higher level of modulation scheme. Both frames from the source and the relay are good 
to the destination. Accordingly, cooperative transmission performs better than 2-hop transmission 
in this topology when the region of average power is from 3 to 6.5. Direct transmission performs 
better when the average power is large enough, because it only takes one transmission to deliver 
a data frame.
