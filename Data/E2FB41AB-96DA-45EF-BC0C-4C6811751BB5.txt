Abstract 
The technology of Wireless Sensor Network is applicable to many areas, such as military, 
security monitoring and control, and medical management. Wireless sensor network is composed of 
a large number of sensors, and it belongs to low-power, low-data and low-distance wireless 
transmission networks. Therefore, the memory, the power, the transmitting distance, and the 
computing capability of sensors are limited. To provide the power-saving security mechanism for 
wireless sensor networks becomes a difficult challenge. A well-known notorious attack in wireless 
sensor networks is the node-compromised attack. To mitigate the impact of such attacks, we 
propose a perfect hash family (PHF) based mechanism which has (w − 1)-degree toleration. In our 
proposed mechanism, the most complicated operation is the one-way hash function which will not 
consume much energy of sensor nodes. Thus, the proposed mechanism can be practicably 
implemented in wireless sensor networks. 
 
Keywords: wireless sensor network, secret sharing, perfect hash families, node-compromised 
attack, toleration 
  
1. Introduction 
With the rapid development of the wireless network [19, 20], more and more applications are 
evolved based on the wireless techniques. Any wireless security protocol should always consider 
the requirements of integrity [13, 17], authentication [13, 17], confidentiality [8] and 
non-repudiation [14], such as the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) [4, 9, 15]. Originally applied to 
the military surveillance, a WSN is a computer network composed of hundreds even thousands 
distributed autonomous devices with embedded sensors to cooperatively monitor environmental 
conditions, like the temperature, the sound and the pressure, etc. So far, the applications of WSNs 
have been used in many civilian areas which can be categorized into several fields including habitat 
monitoring, fire detection, healthcare applications, home automation, object tracking, traffic control 
and so on. 
Each so-called sensor node is usually energized by batteries and equipped with a wireless 
communication device along with a microcontroller. These sensor nodes can be regarded as a small 
computer with a slight computing power and insufficient memory spaces for processing and storing 
data. Without the need to replace their power supplies, the sensor nodes can be deployed in 
wilderness areas or battlefields for many years. However, restricted by the wireless transmission 
distance, each sensor node should be deployed in the nearby place of base stations for forwarding 
data between. The base stations equipped with more computing capacities, memory storages and 
communication resources act as a gateway between sensor nodes and end users. As compared with 
the ad hoc networks [1, 11, 16], both the ad hoc networks and WSNs have similar structures except 
that sensor nodes of WSNs are usually multiple times the number of the ad hoc networks. Generally

M  where the symbols 1, 2 and 3 are 
randomly generated. Let hi ∈F (for i = 1 to 4) be a set of hash functions where hi: A → B, A = {1, 2, 
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and B = {1, 2, 3}. It can be seen that |A| = 9 and |B| = 3. We can denote hi(x) as 
the value of indexes (i, x) of the matrix M. Consequently, a PHF(4; 9, 3, 3) can be expressed as 
Table 1. 
 
Table 1 PHF(4; 9, 3, 3) 
x 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
h1(x) 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3

h3(x) 1 2 3 3 1 2 2 3 1 
h4(x) 1 2 3 2 3 1 3 1 2 
 
From Table 1, one can observe that for any subset X ⊆ A with |X| = 3, there exists at least one 
hash function hi making hi(xj) (for xj ∈ X) distinct. The verification of that F is a PHF(4; 9, 3, 3) is 
demonstrated as Table 2.

Remark: X is a subset of A with |X| = 3. For simplicity, we use the elements “123” of X to represent 
a subset {1, 2, 3}. Let i be the index of a hash function hi ∈F (for i = 1 to 4).  
 
Construction of Perfect Hash Families 
To construct perfect hash families, we can use combinatorial structures or algebra structures. 
Table 3 lists several feasible ways to construct perfect hash families.

Fig. 1 The network system 
 
Take the PHF(4; 9, 3, 3) of Table 1 as an example. Let each block Bi has nine sensor nodes {ni, 
1, …, ni, 9} and there are four key sets {Si, 1, …, Si, 4} for each block. Then, we randomly generate 
three key shares for each key set. Consequently, there are total twelve key shares for each block Bi. 
Each node ni, j would have four sub key shares from different key sets as Table 4. The base station 
of block Bi has all the key sets {Si, 1, …, Si, 4} and thus can verify the message transmitted by each 
node belonging to block Bi. In fact, there exists a PHF(q + 1; q
2, q, w) where q is a large prime 
satisfying ⎟⎟⎠

to compute  
 a3 = f(m ⊕ Ki, 1, 1' ⊕ Ki, 2, 3' ⊕ Ki, 3, 3' ⊕ Ki, 4, 3')  (12) 
and verifies whether 
 f(m ⊕ Ki, 1, 1 ⊕ Ki, 2, 3 ⊕ Ki, 3, 3 ⊕ Ki, 4, 3) = a3.  (13) 
If it does not hold, the base station ignores the message σ3 sent by ni, 3. 
Step 4 The base station fetches the pre-stored key shares (Ki, 1, 2', Ki, 2, 2', Ki, 3, 1', Ki, 4, 3') of ni, 5 
to compute  
 a5 = f(m ⊕ Ki, 1, 2' ⊕ Ki, 2, 2' ⊕ Ki, 3, 1' ⊕ Ki, 4, 3')  (14) 
and verifies whether 
 f(m ⊕ Ki, 1, 2 ⊕ Ki, 2, 2 ⊕ Ki, 3, 1 ⊕ Ki, 4, 3) = a5.  (15) 
If it does not hold, the base station ignores the message σ5 sent by ni, 5. 
Step 5 The base station fetches the pre-stored key shares (Ki, 1, 3', Ki, 2, 1', Ki, 3, 2', Ki, 4, 3') of ni, 7 
to compute  
 a7 = f(m ⊕ Ki, 1, 3' ⊕ Ki, 2, 1' ⊕ Ki, 3, 2' ⊕ Ki, 4, 3')  (16) 
and verifies whether 
 f(m ⊕ Ki, 1, 3 ⊕ Ki, 2, 1 ⊕ Ki, 3, 2 ⊕ Ki, 4, 3) = a7.  (17) 
If it does not hold, the base station ignores the message σ7 sent by ni, 7. 
Step 6 After at least three σI’s have been confirmed, the base station randomly selects three 
nodes, say ni, 3, ni, 5 and ni, 7, and then determines one key set, say Si, 2, that makes the key 
shares of these three nodes distinct.  
Step 7 According to the determined key set Si, 2, the base station sets c = 2 and chooses x, y, v 
∈R{1, 2, 3, 4}4 to compute  
 d3 = x || (Pad(c) || c) ⊕ (Ki, x' of ni, 3),  (18) 
 d5 = y || (Pad(c) || c) ⊕ (Ki, y' of ni, 5),  (19) 
 d7 = v || (Pad(c) || c) ⊕ (Ki, v' of ni, 7),  (20) 
where Pad(⋅) is a padding function, and then returns (d3, d5, d7) to ni, 3, ni, 5 and ni, 7, 
respectively. 
Step 8 On receiving d3, ni, 3 derives c with his key share Ki, x and further computes 
 Q3 = m ⊕ Ki, c.  (21) 
which is then sent to the base station. 
Step 9 On receiving d5, ni, 5 derives c with his key share Ki, y and further computes 
 Q5 = m ⊕ Ki, c.  (22) 
which is then sent to the base station. 
Step 10 On receiving d7, ni, 7 derives c with his key share Ki, v and further computes 
 Q7 = m ⊕ Ki, c.  (23) 
which is then sent to the base station. 
Step 11 The base station reports 
 (m || ni, 3 || ni, 5 || ni, 7 || c || h(Q3) || h(Q5) || h(Q7) || L3 || min(T3, T5, T7)), 
where min(⋅) is the minimum of inputted parameters, to the network system manager. 
 
5. Security Analysis 
In wireless sensor networks, it is important to authenticate an accidental event reported by the 
detecting node. When a malicious attacker attempts to cause the chaos of the network system, he 
might generate a bogus report and then sends it to the base station. Yet, in the proposed mechanism, 
the base station will start verifying an event only after receiving at least |w| reports delivered by 
different nodes. That is to say, the attacker has to know the knowledge of w first. Even if the

for providing authenticity [14] and non-repudiation [8]. Traditionally, a digital signature can be 
verified by anyone else with the signer’s public key. Yet, in some special applications such as the 
electronic voting [9, 12] and the electronic auction [6, 17], the signatures are not suitable for the 
public verification. To fulfill such requirement, Jakobsson et al. [5] introduced the concept of 
designated verifier proofs and in a sense proposed a designated verifier signature (DVS) scheme 
in 1996. Although the resulted signature is publicly verifiable in their scheme, only the designated 
verifier can be convinced that a signature is generated by the claimed signer. On the other hand, 
the designated verifier can also create a valid signature which is computationally indistinguishable 
from the one issued by the original signer for any third party. Consequently, the designated 
verifier can not use this proof to convince any third party that a signature is created by the claimed 
signer. In 2003, however, Wang [16] pointed out that their scheme is insure for that a malicious 
signer can easily cheat the designated verifier. 
In 2004, Saeednia et al. [11] proposed a strong designated verifier signature scheme in which 
the signature verification requires the assistance of the designated verifier’s private key to 
compete. Therefore, only the designated verifier has the ability to verify the signature. Generally 
speaking, a DVS scheme should satisfy the following security requirements: 
(i) Unforgeability: Given the identifier of some designated verifier, say, U1, it is computationally 
infeasible for any malicious adversary to forge a valid DVS with respect to U1 without 
knowing the signer’s private key. 
(ii) Non-transferability: In a DVS scheme, only the designated verifier can be convinced that a 
signature is created by the claimed signer. The designated verifier can not convince any third 
party that a signature is issued by the claimed signer, since he can also forge a valid signature 
which is computationally indistinguishable from the one generated by the original signer. 
(iii) Source Hiding: It is also referred to as the signer’s anonymity. That is, given a message and 
its corresponding DVS, it is computationally infeasible to determine the identifier of real 
signer from the original signer or the designated verifier. 
Consider the application of three-party communication environment. One party may has to

(iii)Computability: 
Given P, Q∈G1, the value of e(P, Q) can be efficiently computed by a polynomial-time 
algorithm. 
 
Definition 1 (Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (BDH) problem) 
Given a BDH instance g, A, B, C ∈ G1 where A = ga, B = gb and C = gc for some a, b, c ∈ *qZ , 
compute e(g, g)abc∈G2. 
 
Definition 2 (Bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption) 
For every probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm A, every positive polynomial Q(⋅) and all 
sufficiently large k, the algorithm A can solve the BDH problem with an advantage at most

i.e.,  
Pr[A(g, ga, gb, gc) = e(g, g)abc; a, b, c ← *qZ , g, ga, gb, gc ← G1] ≤ )(

kQ
. 
The probability is taken over the uniformly and independently g∈G1 and a, b, c ∈ *qZ  and over 
the random choices of A. 
 
2.2 Our Scheme 
The proposed DVS scheme can be divided into two phases: the signature generation and the 
signature verification phases. Initially, the system determines the following public information: 
p, q: two large primes such that q | (p − 1); 
G1, G2: two groups of the same order q; 
g: a generator of order q over G1; 
e: a bilinear pairing, e: G1 → G2; 
h1: a one-way hash function, h1: G2 → {0, 1}n; 
h2: a one-way hash function, h2: *pZ × *pZ × {0, 1}n → {0, 1}n; 
18 
performance. 
 
3.1 Security Analyses 
We discuss some security considerations with respect to the proposed scheme from the 
perspectives of correctness, unforgeability, non-transferability and source hiding. 
 
Correctness 
A DVS scheme for three-party communication environment is correct if one party can 
generate a valid signature such that only the other two can check the validity of the signature 
when all involved parties follow the steps of the scheme. We prove the correctness of our 
proposed scheme as Theorem 1. 
 
Theorem 1. With the signature (r0, r1, r2) for the message M, each of the two designated verifiers 
Ua and Ub can independently check its validity with Eq. (9). 
Proof: From the right-hand side of Eq. (9), we have 
h2(C1, K, C3) 
 = h2(C1, pyg rs
r mod12 , C3) (by Eq. (7)) 
 = h2(C1, pg rxr s mod12 + , C3) 
 = h2(C1, g
k mod p, C3) (by Eq. (6)) 
 = h2(C1, C2, C3) (by Eq. (3)) 
 = r1 (mod q) (by Eq. (5)) 
which leads to the left-hand side of Eq. (9). 
 Q.E.D. 
 
Unforgeability 
To forge a valid DVS with respect to the designated verifiers Ua and Ub, an attacker may 
first randomly choose a message M' and (k', r0', r2') ∈ *qZ  and then attempt to derive r1' from Eq. 
20 
Source hiding 
In the proposed scheme, any third party having the knowledge of the shared session key σ 
can check the validity of the signature. Nevertheless, a forged DVS generated by the two 
designated verifiers has the identical distribution as the one issued by the original signer. 
Consequently, given a message M and its corresponding DVS, it is computationally infeasible for 
any third party to identify the actual signer from the original signer or the designated verifiers, 
even if he knows the shared session key. 
 
3.2 Performance Evaluation 
In this subsection, we compare the proposed DVS scheme with Susilo et al.’s one [15] in 
terms of executed pairings which are considered to be the most time-consuming operation in 
pairings-based systems. It is believed that reducing the number of such computation helps the 
practical implementation. To obtain a fair result, we assume that only one designated verifier is 
involved in each scheme. The detailed comparison is shown as Table 1. From this Table, it can be 
seen that our proposed scheme has a better performance than Susilo et al.’s one by one pairing 
computation as a whole.

4. Conclusions 
In this paper, we have proposed a novel DVS scheme for three-party communication 
environment from pairings. The proposed scheme only allows two designated verifiers to 
independently check the validity of the signer’s signature. The proposed scheme is shown to have 
a better performance than Susilo et al.’s one and also fulfills the security requirement of 
unforgeability, non-transferability and source hiding. Even if the two designated verifiers reveal

 = h2(C1, C2, C3) (by Eq. (3)) 
 = r1 (mod q) (by Eq. (5)) 
which leads to the left-hand side of Eq. (9). 
 Q.E.D. 
 
Unforgeability 
To forge a valid DVS with respect to the designated verifiers Ua and Ub, an attacker may 
first randomly choose a message M' and (k', r0', r2') ∈ *qZ  and then attempt to derive r1' from Eq.
