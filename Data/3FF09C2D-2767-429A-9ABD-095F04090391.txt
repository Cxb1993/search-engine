Abstract
In this study, the influence of post-weld heat treatments on the mechanical

Notched tensile tests were performed to evaluate the presence of notch on the
tensile strength of Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn laser welds, which were post-aged at different
temperatures. Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn laser welds showed notch brittleness except for the
welds post-weld aged at 704℃. In case of the weld aged at 482℃, it had the highest
hardness (Hv440) but shows notch brittleness. The same trend was also observed on
impact tests. The coarsen columnar structure in a weld was preferred to exhibit brittle
transgranular fracture. This characteristics could be due to the lack of extensive slip
systems in titanium alloys, intergranular dimple fracture was seen for the presence of
αat columnar grain boundary.
Fatigue crack growth tests revealed base metal had a slightly higher fatigue crack
growth rate than the welds. The fracture features showed all the specimens exhibited
transgrainular fatigue fracture. The zigzag crack path in the fusion zone of Laser
welds resulted in a reduced fatigue crack growth rate in comparison with the base
metal.Keywords: Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn alloy, hydrogenation, grain refinement.

(1) 前言
高功率二氧化碳雷射銲接在非傳
統加工製造業上佔有重要地位，已廣
泛應用於國防、航太、及精密機械等
領域之加工製造技術。雷射與電子束
銲接均為高能量密度之銲接方法，銲
件之熱影響區及變形量可降至最低程
度，但雷射銲接不需要在真空下進
行，試片尺寸較不受限制，且銲件品
質與電子束銲接之銲件相當。
在鈦合金的應用中，Ti-6Al-4V 的使用
率最高，約佔市場的 53%，然而在非
3(負載波型為正弦波)。於室溫下進行疲
勞裂縫成長試驗試驗。其中最大負荷
係依不同條件試件而作調整，而實驗
應力比分為 R=0.1 及 R=0.5 兩種條件。
(5) 結果與討論
由穿透電子顯微鏡可證實，在原
始 銲 件 熔 融 區 發 現 很 細 的 針 狀
α(Acicular α)散佈於β基地中，並沒有
發現麻田散體組織(Martensite)存在，
如圖 1(a)所示。而隨著時效處理溫度的
提高，其顯微組織亦會有明顯粗大化
的現象，如圖 1(b)、(c)及(d)所示。
圖 2.為 Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn 原始銲件其
銲道硬度值約為 Hv440，分別經由
482℃、593℃、704℃以及 760℃時效
處理三小時，其硬度值變化情形。其
結果顯示在 482℃時效熱處理後顯示
最高硬度，其硬度值可達 Hv460，經
過 593℃以上溫度時處理後，其硬度值
明顯下降，甚至低於原始銲件，比較
銲件銲後原始狀態及母材水淬狀態之
硬度值，銲件之硬度值遠大於母材，
此一結果應可歸究於銲道內微細 α析
出所致之強化，而相對母材為淬火之
麻田散體結構。
圖 3. 為 時 效 熱 處 理 對
Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn 銲件缺口拉伸強度變化
曲線圖，與母材相比較結果顯示
Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn 經過銲接後缺口拉伸強
度明顯下降；且銲道經過時效處理
後，除非高溫時效後(e.g. 704℃)，缺口
拉伸強度明顯降低，但經過高溫時效
處理後，缺口拉伸強度明顯回升，甚
至比原始銲件的強度更高。從巨觀觀
察 Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn 銲件缺口拉伸試片的
側邊破斷面，原始母材和銲件經高溫
時效處理的試片，發現明顯延性破裂
外，原始銲件以及銲件經 482℃、593℃
時效後的試片皆產生顯著脆性破斷，
顯示高缺口引發脆性現象。
圖 4.為 Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn 缺口拉伸破
斷面巨觀，母材破斷面由中心平坦區
(Plate Fracture Zone)及剪唇區 (Slant
Fracture Zone)組成，有面積縮減的現
象，顯示破裂前產生高塑性變形及缺
口鈍化。觀察 Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn 高缺口脆
化試片，如原始銲件及銲件經 482℃、
593℃時效試片，僅顯示相對平坦的破
裂面及非常小的厚度縮減，只有時效
溫度達 704℃以上，缺口脆化效應才降
低。
從掃描式電子顯微鏡觀察缺口拉
伸試件破裂平坦區，顯示細小窩穴狀
破裂，如圖 5(a)所示。觀察銲件巨觀組
織橫截面，在銲件中的其中一側可發
現粗柱狀組織，另一側則較不明顯，
此一因素與原始銲件中組織凝固有
關。應是受限於鈦合金缺少滑移系
統，原始粗大組織如凝固柱狀晶，易
導致破裂在沿著某些特定柱狀晶的平
面產生，當裂縫成長方向垂直其凝固
組織，顯示穿晶細微的窩穴狀破裂特
徵，如圖 5(b)所示，當裂縫成長傾向於
平行柱狀晶成長方向時，則呈現平行
成長之柱狀晶且在晶界有較明顯撕裂
現象，如圖 5(c)，所有 Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn
的銲件均展現類同特徵。不同條件的
試片會有程度不一的沿晶破裂區，而
以銲件經過 593℃的試片最為嚴重，如
圖 5(e)、 (f)。然而在高溫時效 (e.g.
704℃)可發現穿晶窩穴狀破裂穿過柱
狀晶，並於晶界產生晶界滑移，如圖
5(d)所示。

In the open literatures, rather few works have been paid to study mechanical
properties of titanium welds, especially for Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn alloy. The present work
focused on the notched tensile strength (NST) of Ti-6-6-2 laser welds which were
post-treated at various temperatures for 3 hr. The NTS results were correlated with
the microstructures and fracture features.
Material and experimental procedures
Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn in sheet form with a thickness of 4.0 mm was used in this
investigation. The chemical composition of the alloy in weight percent was 5.50 Al,
5.40 V, 1.90 Sn, 0.5 Fe, 0.54 Cu, 0.02 C, 0.011 N with the balanced Ti. The
mill-annealed alloy with the hardness of Hv340 consisted of the microstructures of a
low percentage of β at the boundaries of elongated α grains.  Tensile properties of 
the mill-annealed Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn are an ultimate tensile strength of 1117 MPa, yield
strength of 1086 MPa and an elongation of 20%. The specimens were welded by a
CO2 laser in the mill-annealed condition with the welding direction normal to the
rolling direction. The main welding parameters were laser power of 2.7 kW and
scan rate of 800 mm/min. Post-weld heat treatments (PWHTs) of the welds were
performed in the temperature range of 482-760°C (900-1400°F) for 3 hr in vacuum,
followed by Ar-assisted cooling to 25°C. To distinguish the specimens aged at
various temperature, the numbers 482, 593, 704 and 760 were attached to the
specimens to represent the aging condition.
Figure 1 shows double-edge notch specimen with the notches located at the
weld metal was used in this study. Notched tensile tests were performed in
laboratory air at a constant displacement rate of 1.0 mm/min and the results were the
average of at least three specimens for each testing condition. The dependence of
PWHT temperatures on the notched tensile strength (NTS) of laser welds was
evaluated. Charpy impact tests at room temperature were also conducted with the
specimen thickness of 4.0 mm. The fractured appearance of various specimens was
examined by a Hitachi 4100 scanning electron microscope (SEM). The detail
microstructures of the specimens were examined by JEOL 2000 EX transmission
electron microscope (TEM).
Results and discussion
Figure 2 shows the variation of micro-hardness with PWHT temperatures in the
Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn laser welds. The low energy input of the laser welding resulted in a
narrow fusion zone (FZ) and heat-affected zone. The FZ was considerably harder
than other regions in the weld, regardless of aging conditions. The peak hardness of
the weld could reach Hv 460 after 482oC aging treatment. Moreover, an obvious
15
microstructures in the specimens aged at/above 704oC resulted in a better resistance to
notch brittleness and unstable fracture. It was noticed that a change of fracture
morphologies was found in some local area, showing the evidence of coarse columnar
structure for those specimens aged at/above 593oC (Fig. 6(c)).
Figure 7 presents the SEM fractographs showing the typical fracture appearance
of various specimens. The tensile and impact fracture of base metal showed
extensively transgranular dimple fracture (Fig. 7(a)). Because of the epitaxial
growth and uneven distribution of welding heat, columnar structure on the top weld
side became coarser than that of the bottom weld side. Generally, the lack of
extensive slip systems in titanium alloys led to flat transgranular fracture as a result of
the local tearing along the specific plane of a columnar grain. Transgranular fine
dimple with grain boundary shear was found for the crack propagated normal to the
solidified structure (Fig. 7(b)). However, all welds were more likely to form brittle
fracture at coarse columnar boundaries as the crack extended along the dendrite
growth direction, as shown in (Fig. 7(c)). Such characteristics could be related with
the presence of inter-dendritic α in al welds as confirmed in TEM examinations.  It 
was deduced the limited slip system of thin α promoted britle fracture at the grain 
boundaries, in which accompanied with ductile dimple fracture at α and matrix 
interface, as shown in Fig. 7(b)&(c). Moreover, transgranular dimple fracture across
the columnar dendrite as well as more obvious grain boundary shear was seen in the
specimens aged at higher temperature, eg., 704oC (Fig. 7(d)). It was deduced that
coarseα/β microstructures deformed and resisted the crack growth inwards, therefore,
decreased notch brittleness and improved impact toughness. It was noticed that little
inter-dendritic fracture was observed for the welds aged at 593°C (Fig. 7(e)&(f)).
After chemical analysis using EDX and EPMA, the segregation of alloy elements was
not found. The exact reasons led to such results were not known at this moment. It
could be that the thickness of α at columnar grain boundaries and the relative 
discrepancy in strength/hardness between the boundary and grain interior caused
premature fracture at columnar boundaries and the lowest NTS among the welds.
Conclusions
Extremely fine acicular α uniformly distributed in β matrixwas responsible for the
very high fusion zone hardness in the Ti-6-6-2 laser welds. Unless a high PWHT
temperature (e.g. 704 oC) was employed, the Ti-6-6-2 laser welds showed low NTS
(notch brittleness) and low impact toughness. The fracture features of Ti-6-6-2 laser
welds were strongly affected by the inherent microstructures and crack growth
direction with respect to the solidified structures
