Abstract 
Classification arrhythmic episode 
detection by using associative Petri net (APN) 
for personalized ECG arrhythmias pattern 
identification is proposed for the first time in 
the literature. Association production rules, a 
rule-based classification model, and reasoning 
algorithm of APN are created for ECG 
arrhythmias detection. The proposed 
methodology creates a reasoning model from 
an initial ECG arrhythmias pattern. The 
approach consists of four stages: ECG filtering 
and sampling, feature extraction, transfer 
function building and classification.  
The MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database is 
used for ECG Arrhythmia classification and it 
provides us a comparison of our proposed APN 
with other related conducted studies and other 
data mining methods in arrhythmias detection 
problem.  
Keywords：ECG Arrhythmia, Associative

1. Introduction  
Heart disease is an umbrella term for a number 
of different diseases which affect the heart such 
as arrhythmia, myocardial ischemia, and 
myocardial infarction [1]. As of 2007, it is also 
one of the leading causes of death in the world, 
and especially according to the American Heart 
Association, One American is dying in every 
34 seconds because of this disease [2]. Changes 
in the normal rhythm of a human heart may 
result in different cardiac arrhythmias, which 
may be immediately fatal or cause irreparable 
damage to the heart when sustained over long 
periods of time. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is an 
important routine clinical practice for 
continuous monitoring of cardiac activities. 
The ECG is the record of variation of 
bioelectric potential with respect to time as the 
human heart beats. It provides valuable 
information about the functional aspects of the 
heart and cardiovascular system. Since ECG 
signals vary greatly for different individuals 
and within patient groups [3], ECG pattern 
recognition is a difficult problem even with the 
aid of a computer. Even for the same individual, 
heartbeat patterns significantly change with 
time and under different physical conditions. 
While normal sinus rhythm originates from the 
sinus node of heart, arrhythmias have various 
origins and indicate a wide variety of heart 
problems. Under different situations, the same 
symptoms of arrhythmia produce different 
morphologies due to their origins such as 
premature ventricular contraction [4] [5].  
Moreover, since the biosignals are 
nonstationary signals, this reflection may occur 
at random in the time scale. In this situation, 
the disease symptoms may not show up all the 
time, but would manifest at certain irregular 
intervals during the day. Therefore, for 
effective diagnostics, the study of ECG pattern 
and heart rate variability signal may have to be 
carried out over several hours. Thus, 
computer-based analysis and classification of 
diseases can be very helpful in diagnostics [6] 
[7]. A number of methods have been proposed 
to classify ECG heartbeat patterns based on the 
features extracted from ECG signals. The 
methodologies of Data mining and machine 
learning are also used to detect ECG 
arrhythmias. 
In this study, classification of ECG 
arrhythmias by using associative Petri net 
(APN) is proposed for the first time in the 
literature and is compared with several 
pioneering studies for arrhythmias detection.

This section is a brief description of methods 
used in this research such as a statistical 
sampling method, fuzzy membership function 
generation by Minimize Entropy Principle 
Approach (MEPA) and reasoning process of 
ECG signals by proposed APN. Nevertheless, 
the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database is used for 
ECG Arrhythmia classification and it provides 
us to compare the performance of our proposed 
APN with other related conducted studies in 
Arrhythmias detection problem. 
 
3.1 Dataset Description 
PhysioNet [27] provides a set of databases that 
group records of one or more digitized ECG 
signals, as well as a set of their corresponding 
beat annotations. And, MIT-BIH Arrhythmia 
Database [28] we used is the sub-database in 
studying different types of heartbeats. 
The MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database contains 
48 half-hour excerpts of two-channel 
ambulatory ECG recordings, obtained from 47 
subjects studied by the BIH Arrhythmia 
Laboratory between 1975 and 1979. 
Twenty-three recordings were chosen at 
random from a set of 4000 24-hour ambulatory 
ECG recordings collected from a mixed 
population of inpatients and outpatients at 
Boston's Beth Israel Hospital. The remaining 
25 recordings were selected from the same set 
to the set where has uncommon but clinically 
significant arrhythmias that would not be well 
represented in a small random sample.

Abnormal C7 Aberrated Atrial Premature Beat 
Abnormal C8 Junctional Escape Beat 
Abnormal C9 Ventricular Fusion Beat 
Abnormal C10 Paced Beat 
Abnormal C11 Ventricular Premature Contraction 
 
These groups comprise men and women 
between the ages of 23 and 89, and are 
analyzed by two independent cardiologists who 
use nomenclature to classify them by the types 
of beats and rhythms. Our selected heartbeat 
clusters are classified into the eleven heartbeat 
types including one normal and various 
abnormal types as shown in Table 1. 
 
3.2 Minimize Entropy Principle Approach 
In this section, a Minimize Entropy Principle 
Approach (MEPA) is adopted to provide the 
persuasiveness of determining the length of 
intervals and membership functions in 
heartbeat patterns. A key goal of entropy 
minimization analysis is to determine the 
quantity of information in a given data set. The 
entropy of a probability distribution is a 
measure of the uncertainty of the distribution. 
To subdivide the data into membership 
functions, establishing the threshold between 
classes of data is needed. A threshold line can 
be determined with an entropy minimization 
screening method, and then the segmentation 
process can be started, first into two classes. 
Therefore, repeated partitioning with threshold 
value calculations will allow us to partition the 
data set into a number of fuzzy sets [29]. 
Assume that a threshold value is sought for a 
sample in the range between x1 and x2. An 
entropy equation with each value of x is written 
for the regions [x1, x1+x] and [x1+x, x2] which 
are defined as the first region f and the second 
region g, respectively. Entropy with each value 
of x in the region between x1 and x2 is 
expressed as [30]: 
)()()()()( xExgxExfxE gf   (1)
where 
)](ln)()(ln)([)( 2211 xfxfxfxfxE f   (2)
)](ln)()(ln)([)( 2211 xgxgxgxgxEg   (3)
1)()(  xgxf  (4)
and fk(x) and gk(x) are conditional probabilities 
that class k sample in the region [x1, x1+x] and 
[x1+x, x2], respectively. A value of x that gives 
the minimum entropy is the optimum threshold 
value. The value estimates of fk(x) and gk(x), f(x) 
and g(x), are calculated as follows: [30]

Fig. 3. A generalized APN structure 
 
If the antecedent portion or consequence 
portion of an associative production rule (APR) 
contains "and" or "or" connectors, then it is 
called a composite APR. The composite APR 
can be distinguished into the following five 
rule-types: 
Type 1: IF dj THEN dk (CF = c). The 
reasoning process of this type of association 
rule can be represented by (9)  
cpp jk *)()(     when s , c  (9)
Type 2: IF dj1 and dj2 and….and djn THEN dk 
(CF= c). The reasoning process of this type of 
association rule can be represented by (10). 
  cpppMinp jnjjk *)(),....(),()( 21  

Type 3: IF dj THEN dk1 and dk2 and…and dkn

association rule can be represented by (11). 
cpp jk *)()( 1   , cpp jk *)()( 2    ,…, 
cpp jkn *)()(       when s , c  (11)
Type 4: IF dj1 or dj2 or….or djn THEN dk 
(CF= ci). The reasoning process of this type of 
association rule can be represented by (12).  
 njnjjk cpcpcpp *)(,....*)(,*)(max)( 2211  

Type 5: IF dj THEN dk1 or dk2 or….or dkn 
(CF= ci). The reasoning process of this type of 
association rule can be represented by (13).  
jknjkjk ppcppcpp )()(,...*)()(,*)()( 2211  
 when iis  , iic  , ni ,...2,1  (13)
Using this simple mechanism, all the APRs 
can be mathematically and graphically 
illustrated. By carefully connecting related 
place and assigning reasonable values of 
certainty factors (CF) to transitions, we can 
come up with an APN that can make decision 
based on the expertise during its construction. 
 
4. Experimental procedure  
The experimental procedure for arrhythmic 
beat detection is divided into the following 
stages: ECG filtering and sampling, feature 
extraction, transfer function building and 
classification. In the first and second stages, 
preprocessing of the ECG recording was 
performed to achieve noise removal and 
extraction of the signal features were used for 
beat characterization. The sampling size of 
ECG data set has been estimated by the 
population ratio. In the third stage, the degree 
of truth of each proposition was transformed 
through fuzzy membership functions in order to 
be utilized for APN model. In the fourth stage, 
APN reasoning algorithm of classification was 
used for arrhythmic beat detection and an APN 
reasoning example is illustrated in this section. 
 
4.1 ECG filtering and sampling 
First, we use a non-linear bilateral filter to 
remove noise. It can smooth the noise but 
preserve the important features. In image 
processing domain, some researchers use this 
filter to smooth images while preserving edges, 
by means of a nonlinear combination of nearby 
image values [33]. The definition of bilateral 
filter is defined as equation (14):

(14)
Where )(ˆ kX is the smoothed signal, 
)( nkY  is the original signal, w is the width of 
the filter W(k, n). W (k, n) is the kernel function 
of the bilateral filter, which is the product of 
two Gaussion smooth functions and can be 
expressed as:

propagation of uncertain evidence from the 
antecedent of a production rule to its 
consequences. By combining the propositions 
and certainty factors, we can obtain a set of 
APRs and the structure of our APN model for 
arrhythmic beat detection is shown in Fig. 4.

detection 
 
4.4 Arrhythmic beat classification 
In reasoning and classification stage, an APN 
reasoning algorithm is used to classify the 
feature vectors into the following category 
pairs: normal/abnormal heartbeat or 11 
different types of arrhythmic beat. An ECG 
reasoning example through APN model is 
illustrated as follow:  
From Fig. 4, our APN for the symptoms of 
heart disease reasoning have eight inputs (8 
features), eleven middle states (one normal 
heart beat and 10 symptoms of heart disease), 
and one final state. All the degree of truth and 
states of the input places in the APN are gained 
by the fuzzy membership functions, which are 
shown in Appendix A. All the ECG samples 
are gain membership degree and linguistic 
variable themselves from the input of APN by 
fuzzy membership function and all the values 
of certainty factor in the APN are shown in 
Table 4.  
When APRs are used, the propagation of 
uncertainty is accomplished by repeated 
application of different types of APR. 
According to the differently antecedent of a 
production rule, different combination 
functions are used for the propagation of 
uncertain evidence in the inference network. 
The knowledge base of our proposed system 
contains the following APNs: 
For example, eight original characteristics 
value [x1, x2,… x8] in Table 3 of an ECG 
extracted signal from ECG wave are [-2.7162, 
-2.3648, -1.4864, -0.5810, 0, 0.2263, 0.1894, 0]. 
From Appendix A, we can obtained the 
membership degree and the fuzzy linguistic 
value of this ECG extracted signal are [0.836, 
1.0, 0.899, 0.791, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0] and [M, L, 
M, M, H, H, H, L]. Let place p20 be a goal 
place, d20 (v) is the proposition of goal place p20 
and α(p20(v)) is the degree of truth of d20 (v). 
Assume that all the threshold values of ij and 
γij are set to 0.15 and 0.3, respectively. The 
reasoning example of our APN for the 
symptoms of heart disease reasoning is as 
follow: 
 
Step1: From starting places p1, p2,… p8 : Places 
p1, p2,…p8 are starting places and β(p1) = d1, 
β(p2) = d2,…..β(p8) = d8 are 8 propositions 
of starting places. IRS(ps) = {p9, p10,… p19} 
 
Step2: In descendant place pi, pi  IRS(ps), 
s=1, 2,...,8; i=9, 10,…19. 
APsi = {p1, p2, …, p8} and all transitions are 
enabled, places p1, p2,… p8 are exist since 
(α(pi) ≥ λ) and all the values of support and 
confidence are greater than threshold  and γ 
(i.e. sij ≥ τij = 0.15 and cij ≥ γij =0.3, i=1,2,..8; 
j=9, 10,…19). Tokens are moved from p1, 
p2,… p8 to p9, p10,… p19. From Table 4, the 
degree of truth of proposition of place p9, 
p10,… p19 are 
 
g = α(pj)= Min{α(pi)*cij | i=1,2,…8, j=9,10,…19},  
α(p9)=Min{α(p1) * c19, α(p2) * c29,…α(p8) * c89} 
=Min{0.836*0.2331, 1*0.3486, 0.899*0.0769, 
0.791*0.3115, 1*0.1088, 1*0.2941, 
1*0.0827, 1*0.0889} = 0.0692 
.
. 
. 
.
α(p19)= Min{α(p1)*c1,19, α(p2)*c2,19,…α(p8)*c8,19} 
= Min{0.836*0.1429, 1*0.2740, 0.899*0.3846, 
0.791*0.3279, 1*0.4014, 1*0.3529, 
1*0.2857, 1*0.3278} = 0.1195  
Therefore, α(pj | j=9, 10,…19) = {0.0692, 0.0461, 0, 
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.1195} 
 
 10
select proposition d20 (v) and the degree of 
truth of d20 (v) in the place p20 by APRs as: 
V = {(p20, d20(1), α(p20(1))), (p20, d20(2), 
α(p20(2))),… (p20, d20(11), α(p20(11)))}  
z = Max {α(p20(1)), α(p20(2)),…α(p20(11))} 
= Max {0.06228, 0.04149, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
0, 0.10755} 
= 0.10755 (at p19→p20 ) 
Step 5: Obtain proposition d20 (v) and the 
degree of truth α(p20(v)) in the place p20. 
 
Therefore, we can obtain the belonged cluster 
(cluster 11: Ventricular Premature Contraction) 
and degree of truth is 0.10755 from this 
example.  
 
5. Experimental results and Discussion 
The MIT-BIH arrhythmia database was used 
for the evaluation of our proposed method. This 
section describes two face classification 
experiments. Three performance measures, 
classification sensitivity, specificity and 
accuracy are used in the following. Sensitivity 
and specificity are the most widely used 
statistics used to describe a diagnostic test. 
Sensitivity is the correctly detected events 
among the total number of events and is equal 
to TP divided by the sum of TP and FN. 
Specificity refers to the rate of correctly 
classified nonevents and is, therefore, the ratio 
of TN to the sum of TN and FP. Classification 
accuracy is defined as the ratio of the number 
of correctly classified patterns (TP and TN) to 
the total number of patterns classified. In order 
to evaluate the performance of our proposed 
method, the measuring criterion is listed as 
follow:  
True Positives (TP): Number of correct beats 
classified as correct cluster.  
True Negatives (TN): Number of incorrect 
beats classified as incorrect cluster.  
False Positives (FP): Number of incorrect 
beats classified as correct cluster.  
False Negatives (FN): Number of correct 
beats classified as incorrect cluster.  
And, sensitivity is defined with equation TP / 
(TP + FN), specificity is defined with equation 
TN / (FP + TN), and overall accuracy is 
defined with equation (TP +TN) / (TP +FP + 
FN + TN). 
In our evaluation, we use 368 cases in 
training and 185 cases for testing. In our 
experiment, APN is used to classify heartbeat 
into two categories: normal cluster and 
abnormal cluster. The abnormal cluster 
consisted of all the clusters 2, 3…11 are shown 
in Table 1. After learning and testing, the 
classification sensitivity is 95%, the specificity 
is 82.3%, and the overall accuracy is 84.6% in 
our proposed APN reasoning model. 
 
Table 5. Comparative results of heartbeat beat 
recognition 
Heartbeat APN [19] [20] [14] [18] 
C1 84.86% 89.8% 93% 98.1% 93.9%
C2 95.68% 85.8% - 97% - 
C3 94.59% - 99% 94% -

C11 94.59% 90.3% 100% 96.5% 93.9%
( - : means did not discriminate this beat class) 
 
We try to discriminate the clusters from 
abnormal heartbeats further and compare with 
several pioneering studies. Table 5 summarizes 
the comparative results of the accuracy of beat 
recognition with support vector machine 
classifier [19], neuro-fuzzy network [20], fuzzy 
hybrid neural network [14], and mirrored gauss 
model [18]. From Table 5, our proposed APN 
model can successfully recognize most of 
clusters since every cluster’s discriminate 
accuracy are greater than 90% except cluster1. 
The comparison result indicates good accuracy 
of our proposed APN model and demonstrates 
that APN model have distinct effects on 
classification of multi-clusters ECG 
arrhythmias detection. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Classification systems that are used in medical 
decision-making provide medical data to be 
examined in shorter time and more detailed. In 
this study, we proposed a methodology for the 
automated detection of ECG arrhythmia that 
employed classification using a generalized 
APN model. The main advantage of our 
proposed methodology is the combination of 
high accuracy with the ability to provide

Abstract 
 
Mobile phones have become so popular that nearly 
everybody owns one. According to the investigation 
research of National Communications Commission, 
the popularity rate of mobile phone was 107.3%. It 
means that third-generation mobile services have 
become the mainstream of Taiwan mobile services. In 
the future, during the continuous progress of mobile 
technology, each person will be more seriously 
dependence on mobile phones.  A total of 450 
questionnaires were sent and the response rate is 
47.1% and total 184 valid questionnaires received.  
The analytical results revealed that there is a 
significant difference between the usage of mobile 
phone and the level of MPDS. Besides, the level of  
the dependence on mobile phone between the male 
users and female users have no significant difference 
and there are no significant difference between the 
dependence on mobile phone and the handset uses 
time.  
 
1. Introduction 
 
According to the information provided by National 
Communications Commission (NCC), the number of 
users for mobile communications was about 24.68 
million and the popularity rate of mobile phone was 
107.3% in the second quarter of 2008. Which the 
increasing rate of overall mobile users was 0.8%. The 
total of third-generation mobile users was more than 
the one-third of overall mobile phones and still 
increasing. It was more than the previous season 
12.8% that increase 1 million users and total about 
8.98 million users. To various types of mobile 
technology, the third-generation mobile users were 
already 63.9% of overall mobile users who use mobile 
to explore Internet. It is obviously that third-
generation mobile services have become the 
mainstream of Taiwan mobile services (shown as 
Figure 1 and 2). 
In the popularity of mobile communication and the 
using third-generation mobile phone to explore 
Internet, government departments, enterprises and 
individuals must face up the problems of dependent on 
mobile phone addiction. Other study found that 
individuals who suffer from an anxiety disorder may 
benefit from a clinical assessment to rule out mobile 
phone abuse or dependency. 
In addition, Csikszentmihalyi [3] proposed that 
when people in an activity, if focused and fully 
invested in its context which has filtered out the 
irrelevant perceptual and fall into an immersion 
situation. Further, Csikszentmihalyi [4] also pointed 
out the immersion situation that was a flow experience 
which is a person to fully put one thing (or an event) 
to, and other things from him has been irrelevant, and 
the process to him is a joy that make him fully 
invested at all costs. This start flow experience and the 
behavior of focus on a specific thing is likely the 
situation on mobile phone dependency syndrome 
(MPDS) and addiction. From the display of literature 
and the official statistics information of government 
departments, it is already very common in using 
mobile phone in Taiwan. Most people often use mobile 
phone to explore Internet and send message and 
entertainment. Therefore, when users often carry the 
mobile phone and dependence gradually aggravated 
circumstances, such acts will result in mobile phone 
users to deepen the dependence and arising MPDS and 
even the mobile phone addiction that resulting in its 
work, life or academic impact. 
 
Table 1. The related study of flow theory. 
Viewpoint Author 
Internet addiction may lead to depression or isolated situation. Bell, 2007 [1] 
Describes that flow are a temporary and subjective experience. 
It is also why people are willing to continue to engage in a 
certain activity. 
Webster et. al., 1993 [10] 
Flow Theory 
Describes that people carries on the 
activity, if invests completely, will 
remove other consciousness. 
Csikszentmihalyi, 1975 [3] 
Further more to describes one kind 
to treat as the flow theory oneself to 
have the goal experience. 
Csikszentmihalyi, 1991 [4] 
 Drift Current Theory 
Describes  “drift current” each kind 
of bad deviation behavior process 
and the elaboration. 
Matza, 1964 [8] 
Describes one kind of mind 
condition, including consciousness, 
and the emotion on experiences. 
Maslow, 1968 [7]  
 
smoking, betel nut, drug and Internet addiction, all 
could be evaluated and identified by the specific scales 
[3, 9, 11]. Due to the past studies focused on the 
problems of alcohol, drug and Internet addiction, 
cause lack of research on mobile phone dependency 
syndrome in recently. Besides, because of lack of 
sustenance or social life and without sense of 
achievement in real life, most people who were 
Internet addicts seen the Internet to the heaven. And 
these people which lack self-confidence and poor 
social skills may significantly higher dependence in 
mobile and Internet. 
 
2.3 Internet addiction 
 
Internet addiction means people who abuse Internet 
and affect the routine and/or normal life. In 1994, the 
well-know psychologist Dr. Young adapted a similar 
pathological gambling situation as a model to identify 
patients who have unhealthy behavior on Internet, and  
developed eight criteria to diagnose Internet addiction. 
These eight-question as follow: (1) Do you feel 
preoccupied with the Internet (think about previous 
online activity or anticipate next online session)? (2) 
Do you feel the need to use the Internet with 
increasing amounts of time in order to achieve 
satisfaction? (3) Have you repeatedly made 
unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop 
Internet use? (4) Do you feel restless, moody, 
depressed, or irritable when attempting to cut down or 
stop Internet use? (5) Do you stay on-line longer than 
originally intended? (6) Have you jeopardized or 
risked the loss of significant relationship, job, 
educational or career opportunity because of the 
Internet? (7) Have you lied to family members, 
therapist, or others to conceal the extent of 
involvement with the Internet? (8) Do you use the 
Internet as a way of escaping from problems or of 
relieving a dysphonic mood (e.g., feelings of 
helplessness, guilt, anxiety, and depression)? 
Answering "yes" to five or more questions may mean 
you suffer from “Internet addiction” over a six month 
period and besides there are more than 40 hours per 
week on Internet, Even more sure that a patient 
suffering from "Internet addiction disorder"[11]. 
Therefore, according to study shown that there were 
relevant between Internet addiction and the use of 
time, this study was to explore relevant between 
mobile phone dependency syndrome and use of time. 
 
3. Research method and hypotheses 
 
According to the method of related research and 
data collection, we listed the research hypotheses as 
follow: (1) whether correlation between Internet 
addiction and mobile phone dependency syndrome? (2) 
Whether difference between mobile phone dependency 
syndrome and gender? (3) Whether difference mobile 
phone dependency syndrome between the experiences 
of mobile phone usage.

are all greater than 0.8 as well as represent there is 
an excellent internal consistency. 
The design process of this questionnaire has been 
pilot tested and corrected by many experts and 
scholars.  Moreover, it has also been pretested and 
opinions exchanged regarding the content-items, 
semantics, and orders. The designed contents of the 
questionnaire are based on the previous literature 
discussions, references from the domestic and foreign 
related theories and assessment sheets about the 
Internet addicted phenomena, and relevant research 
papers and surveys. The questionnaire satisfies the 
content validity and face validity. 
 
4.3 The result of the study 
 
The results of the study are divided into two 
sections. The first section discusses the relationships 
between internet addition and mobile phone 
dependency syndrome. The hypotheses H1 were tested 
using Pearson Correlation procedure. The second 
section analyzes the effect of some demographic 
variables such as gender and he experiences of mobile 
phone usage (less 3 years, 3~5 years, 6~10 years, and 
greater 10 years). The hypotheses H2 and H3 were 
tested using independent samples T test and one-way 
ANOVA, respectively.  
The level of significance for acceptance or rejection 
of each hypothesis for this study was set at the 0.05 
level (α value), which is a moderate level used by most 
researchers because it reduces the risk of Type I error  
(Borg & Gall, 1989). The probability value (p-value) 
of a statistical hypothesis test is the probability of 
getting a value of the test statistic as extreme as or 
more extreme than that observed by chance alone.  
 
(1) Based on the Pearson test, there is a significant 
positive correlation between internet addition and 
mobile phone dependency (p < 0.001). In other words, 
people have the higher degree of internet addition the 
degree of mobile phone dependency syndrome is also 
higher. 
  
(2) The results of T-test are shown in Table 3. The 
probability values (p-value) are greater than the 
significant level (p = 0.194 > α = 0.05), 95% 
confidence interval, shows that we should accept the 
null hypothesis and there are no differences in the 
dependence on mobile phone between males and 
females.  
 
(3) The ANOVA test of the dependence on mobile 
phone between the different experiences of mobile 
phone usage is shown in Tables 4. From Table 4, 
ANOVA test shown that the null hypothesis must be 
accepted since the value of F is 1.89 and the p-value is 
0.133. We use a cut of point of 0.05 (α = 0.05) as 
their criterion for statistical significance. Hence, the 
observed significance value is less than 0.05, we can 
say that there is no a significant difference between 
the different experiences of mobile phone usage.
