Exchange bias in [Pt/Co]/NiO multilayers were studied as a function of film thickness and [Pt/Co] 
layer repetition.  A strong temperature dependence of the coercivity, Hc,and exchange bias field, 
Hex, was observed for a thick and thinnest [Pt/Co]/NiO multilayers.  While the thinnest [Pt(3 
nm)/Co(1.25 nm)]4/NiO multilayer exhibits no in-plane exchange bias field, a perpendicular  
Hex~ -150 Oe at 80 K was measured.  By contrast, the thickest [Pt(12 nm)/Co(10 nm)]1/NiO 
multilayer exhibited an in-plane Hex//~ -600 Oe (with Hex//~ -1300 Oe at 5 K) with no measurable 
perpendicular exchange bias field.  The estimated interfacial exchange coupling energy implies 
the effective Co layer thickness contributing to the exchange bias is effective only in Co layer in 
contact with NiO bottom layer.  AC susceptibility and the temperature dependence of Hex show 
that the critical Co thickness for onset of perpendicular exchange bias is 1.25 nm with a reduced 
blocking temperature TB~200 K, compared to that (TB~250 K) for a thick [Pt/Co]/NiO multilayer. 
This is attributed to disordered CoPt phases that formed due to intermixing between Co and Pt 
during deposition. 
 
1 Introduction 
Perpendicular exchange bias has been of great interest during past years due to its potential 
application in spin-electronics based devices [1-3]. It refers to the applied field (normal to film 
plane) resulting in a hysteresis loop shift [4] in a typical ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic bilayer 
or multilayer systems [5,6] and is different from conventional in-plane exchange bias where the 
field is applied along the film plane [7-10]. In this paper, different thicknesses and repetitions of 
[Pt/Co] layers were prepared on top of a NiO (35 nm) bottom layer to study the in-plane (Hex//) 
and perpendicular (Hex  exchange bias and to correlate the criteria for obtaining perpendicular 
exchange bias and the temperature dependence of Hex when the thickness of the Co layer was 
reduced. 
 
2 Experimental procedure 
A dual ion-beam deposition technique was used to prepare the [Pt/Co]/NiO multilayers [11]. The 
system consists of a Kaufman deposition source and an End-Hall assisted source. The Kaufman 
source is used to focus an argon ion beam onto a target surface for depositing Pt and Co layer 
while the End-Hall source is used to bombard the substrate for depositing bottom NiO layer

 To study the changes in exchange bias arising from a single layer and different repetitions thinner 
[Pt/Co] layers that result in an equivalent total Co and Pt layer thickness, temperature scans of the 
coercivity (Hc) and exchange bias field (Hex) were collected for a single [Pt (12 nm)/Co (10 
nm)]/NiO film and a four layer [Pt (3 nm)/Co (2.5 nm)]4/NiO multilayer, the results of which are 
shown in Fig. 3. At room temperature, an enhanced Hc~ 70 Oe was found for the [Pt 12 nm/Co 
10 nm]/NiO multilayer, compared to that of a Pt/Co reference layer (Hc~ 40? Oe). This indicates 
exchange coupling exists between ferromagnetic Co and antiferromagnetic NiO. Hc~ 120 Oe for 
the thinner layer [Pt (3 nm)/Co (2.5 nm)]4/NiO multilayer is larger than that of thicker single 
[Pt/Co]/NiO system which may indicate that differences in the microstructure of the films (i.e., 
the single versus multilayer configuration) provide slightly different domain wall pinning 
environments. When field-cooled (in-plane under a 25 kOe field), the thick one unit of [Pt (12 
nm)/Co (10 nm)]/NiO multilayers to 5 K, a larger exchange bias loop shift of Hex~ -1300 Oe was 
observed, as shown in inset of Fig. 3(a), when compared to the Hex~ -130 Oe for the [Pt (3 
nm)/Co (2.5 nm)]4/NiO film (Fig. 3(b)).  Both samples exhibit similar blocking temperatures of 
200 K (i.e., when Hex(T)=0) so that the weaker exchange bias measured in the [Pt (3 nm)/Co (2.5 
nm)]4/NiO film is not the result of a difference in the thermal energy compared to the exchange 
coupling energy between the two film systems.  The significantly weaker Hex for the film 
system with the thinner Co layer in contact with the NiO is unusual as typically in exchange 
biased film systems Hex  1/tFM, where tFM is the ferromagnet's thickness. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A similar temperature dependence of Hc(T) and Hex(T) was found for the thin 4 unit [Pt(3 
nm)/Co(2.5 nm)]4/NiO multilayers and single thick [Pt (12 nm)/Co (10 nm)]/NiO film, as shown 
in Fig. 3(a) and Fig. 3(b), with a factor of ten difference in Hc(T) and Hex(T) between the film 
systems. The coercivity decreases monotonically with increasing temperature and the Hex ~ -130 
Oe at 5 K is one order magnitude smaller than that in one unit of [Pt(12 nm)/Co(10 nm)]/NiO 
multilayers. It should be noted that while the total Co thickness is the same for these two samples, 
the drastic decrease in Hex indicates the exchange coupling is effective only near interface 
between Co and NiO.  The interlayer coupling (Co layers separated by Pt layers) seems to 
counteract any increase in interfacial coupling provided by the thinner Co layer in the [Pt (3 
Fig. 3 Temperature dependence of Hc and Hex of [Pt (12 nm) /Co (10 nm)]/NiO (a) and [Pt (3 nm) /Co (2.5 
nm)]4/NiO (b) multilayers measured with field applied parallel to film plane. Inset shows the hysteresis loops 
measured at 5 K.

nm)/Co (1.25 nm)]4/NiO multilayer was examined.  Field cooling the sample to 5 K in 25 kOe 
with the magnetic field along the film plane (in-plane) direction exhibited no evidence of 
exchange coupling, with Hex//= 0 and Hc//~ 300 Oe.  A room temperature Hc//~ 20 Oe is 
consistent with the plane Pt/Co components of the [Pt/Co]4 film, further evidence that no 
exchange coupling is present in this film with the thinnest Co layer.  While the thicker films 
described above shown no out-of-plane exchange coupling, in this [Pt (3 nm)/Co (1.25 nm)]4/NiO 
multilayer, the room temperature hysteresis loop of a thinnest [Pt(3 nm)/Co(1.25 nm)]4/NiO 
multilayer exhibits an out-of-plane easy axis with Hc~ 50 Oe. Field-cooling the sample from T= 
570 K (greater than the Néel temperature of NiO [12]) with an applied field (15 kOe) 
perpendicular to the film plane results in the perpendicular exchange bias with Hex~ -150 Oe at 
80 K. A strong temperature dependence of Hc and Hex was observed (Fig. 5) and both decrease 
with increasing temperatures with a blocking temperature, TB~ 200 K, in agreement with that 
observed for the thicker [Pt/Co]/NiO multilayers. The above results indicate that the critical 
thickness of Co required for out-of-plane exchange coupling is estimated to be 1.25 nm, the 
criteria for the onset of perpendicular exchange bias where the Co spin moments are tilted 
towards out-of-plane directions. The perpendicular interfacial energy at 80 K is estimated to be 
ex ~0.07 erg/cm2, about one order magnitude smaller than that observed in a thick [Pt (12 
nm)/Co (10 nm)]/NiO multilayer (ex// ~0.6 erg/cm2 at 80 K). It should be noted that the total Co 
thickness of former (5 nm) is half of the latter (10 nm). If we only consider the effective Co 
thickness is the first layer in contact with NiO, then the results are in good agreement with the 
observed ex for a thick (10 nm Co) and a thinnest (Co 1.25 nm) [Pt/Co]/NiO multilayer. 
Therefore, the observed different interfacial energies in [Pt/Co]NiO multilayers imply that the 
exchange coupling depends on the spin-directions close to the interface. 
 
4 Conclusions 
The in-plane and perpendicular exchange bias in [Pt/Co]/NiO multilayers were studied. The Co 
spin alignments due to thickness and repetition of [Pt/Co] will affect the strength and kinds 
(in-plane or out-of-plane) of exchange bias. A thick [Pt(12 nm)/Co(10 nm)]/NiO multilayer 
exhibits strongest in-plane exchange bias whereas a perpendicular exchange bias was found for a 
thinnest [Pt(3 nm)/Co(1.25 nm)]4/NiO multilayer. The estimated in-plane and perpendicular 
interfacial exchange energy implies the exchange bias is only effective in the first Co layer in 
contact with NiO layer.
