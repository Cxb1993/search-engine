iCare Home Portal: An Extended Quality Aging e-Service Model 
 
he quality of life of senior citizens around the world is a critical issue in 
today’s society.  According to World Health Organization 
(http://www.who.int/), there were 600 million people aged 60 and over in 
2000; there will be 1.2 billion by 2025 and 2 billion by 2050.  In addition to the 
thousands of unnecessary deaths, each year missed health care opportunities cost the 
nation more than 1 billion dollars in avoidable hospital bills, and nearly 41 million 
work days, resulting in the loss of 11.5 billion for American businesses,, as reported 
by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (http://www.aoa.gov/).  These 
make assisted living and home care become a fast growing health-care sector.  A 
scrutiny of extant technologies for aging services (see Sidebar 1) reveals that they are 
invariably aiming at health care or electronic care (eCare) and overlooking social and 
behavioral aspects of aging service.  eCare is an emerging health care field that 
utilizes Web technologies.  Angood 
T 
[2] identified three eCare trends that utilize the 
Internet: medical informatics (focused on information), telemedicine (focused on 
communication), and cybermedicine (focused on the Internet and global networking 
technologies).  These eCare trends share a common belief in that maintaining an 
independent lifestyle is socially important to the quality of life of seniors and 
caregivers, which helps reduce potential health-care costs health-care costs associated 
with hospitalization or placement in a full-time care facility. Unfortunately, existing 
health care or eCare services for seniors are mostly oriented toward clinical 
gerontology or neuropsychology.  They overlook certain quality dimensions such as 
community involvement, consumer participation, and continuous quality 
improvement.  In this paper, we describe an intelligent care (iCare) system that 
makes an eCare system ambient enough to address social and behavioral aspects of 
aging service. The iCare system is characterized with an iCare ontology featuring 
ambient service accessibility, unbound information reachability, attentive personalized 
service provision, innovative life-style creation, precious digital memory and 
seemingless social connection.  The objective of the system is to provide quality 
e-services to the elderly anywhere and anytime via iCare home portal. 
 
The Need for Expanding eCare Model 
 
According to American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, care 
quality encompasses ten elements, we extract six of them that are related to iCare 
model (except commitment, Governance & Accountability, Human Resources 
Development, Research Findings and Education): (1) Leading-edge personal care and 
 2
dimension are to promote healthy behavior for problems prevention, achieve early 
disease detection to establish disease signatures before symptoms become readily 
apparent, and improve treatment compliance to help people recover smoothly. The 
relationship dimension, conversely, concerns with only the informal caregivers (such 
as friends, neighbors, coworkers, family members, contents providers, etc.). 
 
Theory underlying the iCare decision dimension 
The novel value of iCare rests in its decision dimension, which represents virtual 
collective decisions (involving numerous participants) when determining which 
e-services (in terms of service concepts defined below) are appropriate and can be 
tailored to the context of the elderly. The underlying theory in the iCare decision 
dimension is the Stacey Model.  
The Stacey Model (also called the Certainty-Agreement Model) was proposed by 
Ralph Stacey in 1996 [11]. The objective of the model was to select appropriate 
management actions within a complex adaptive system involving multiple 
participants based on the degrees of certainty and levels of agreement (Table 1). Many 
different disciplines in collective decision-making correspond to different zones of 
decision problems. In accordance with different degrees of certainty and agreement, 
the disciplines employed by iCare include garbage-can reasoning, brainstorming, and 
case-based reasoning. 
For the simple zone of collective decision-making, decision problems are 
straightforward for planning and controlling (i.e., close to certainty and agreement) 
and the principle of case-based reasoning is adopted to resolve decision problems. In 
the chaos zone, decision problems are difficult to handle without conformity (far from 
certainty and agreement). The zone between the chaos and simple zones is called the 
“zone of complexity” and the principles of garbage-can reasoning and brainstorming 
are embraced. 
The collective decision making will be triggered by iCare home portal 
automatically based on the information of the elderly single/multiple needs identified. 
Garbage-can reasoning is exerted in the presence of the elderly multiple needs given 
the resource constraints on the part of the multiple care givers (close or remote). For 
example, a collective decision derived from garbage-can reasoning would be rendered 
at a situation that the elderly person has to decide to eat dinner with a daughter 
visiting unexpectedly or play chess (e-service) with neighbors as planned (i.e., given 
the simultaneous presence of the family need and the social networking need at the 
same time slot for the elderly). Brainstorming is performed in the presence of the 
elderly single need desiring for interesting e-services. For instance, a collective 
decision derived from brainstorming would be rendered at a situation that the agents

iCare services. The Home-Portal is a smart interface connecting the elderly with 
service providers and other participants. These concepts will are further discussed as 
follows. 
z The Service concept is characterized with three high-level attributes (scope, 
source, and type). 
 Scope means the degree of heterogeneity and reachability that a service 
embodies (i.e., how specialized and widely an e-service takes on).   
  Source indicates the resource origins from which an e-service draws upon 
(e.g., human being or contents providers).   
 Type specifies the forms that an e-service is rendered. They could be 
data-oriented (e.g., text or multimedia), community-oriented (e.g., 
community channel for the elderly people), personal information (e.g., 
information management pertaining to the daily life of the aging people), 
and information category (e.g., special-topic information such as medical 
information or financial information).   
z The Device concept refers to the set of devices (involved in the iCare e-services) 
that can be divided into two categories (electronic and non-electronic). 
 Electronic means electronic hardware involved in the iCare environment 
(i.e., sensors, handheld devices, etc.). 
 Non-Electronic indicates the non-electronic equipments around the 
surroundings (e.g., myriad kinds of objects). 
z The Participant concept is characterized with four attributes (role, relationship, 
profile and preference). 
 Role indicates the character played by a participant involved in the iCare 
environment (e.g., the elderly person, caregiver, family member, remote 
caregiver, etc.). 
 Relationship means the relationship of a participant to the elderly person. 
 Profile specifies the demographic profile of a participant. 
 Preference specifies the preference of a participant (e.g., for the example of 
the elderly person, it includes the set of e-services the elderly person has 
consumed or his (her) habits and hobbies. 
In Figure 1(b), a node refers to a concept described above, a dotted arrow line 
indicates the “is-a” relationship from a subclass concept to a class concept, and a solid 
arrow line denotes the “part-of” relationship from a part concept to an integral 
concept.   
An example (home-movie e-service) is utilized to explain how an e-service is 
described using the concepts defined in the iCare service ontology. This service 
provides customized video comprising photos, pictures and videos (likely provided by

has been developed and integrated into the portal for representing certain participants 
who engage in an idea generation session for care service recommendations. To 
evaluate the agent-based e-brainstorming mechanism in iCare, the improvement in the 
number of ideas generated (i.e., group creativity) and the diversity of ideas generated 
must be justified for the purpose of innovative care service recommendations and 
continuous quality improvement.  The experimental setting of the prototype is as 
follows. (1) a universe of 8 e-services (i.e., possible ideas of services delivered) for 
mental needs under consideration; (2) up to 10 possible roles (i.e., agents representing 
son, daughter, etc.) involved in e-brainstorming, each of which embodies its own 
knowledge domains; (3) a benchmark Greedy mechanism that randomly selects an 
e-service from existing knowledge of relevant domains for service recommendations; 
(4) two metrics, Average Service Types and Service Diversity Rate (see definition 
below), were used for inspection of the mechanism’s performance.  Figure 3 shows 
the portal with the e-brainstorming mechanism, while Table 2 presents the evaluation 
results.

Performance Benchmarks 
This study benchmarks the Greedy model against the e-brainstorming model by 
comparing the number of types and their diversity of the generated e-services with 
different number of roles (3, 5, or 7) involved in the decision process for justifying the 
capability of group creativity in e-brainstorming. From Table 2(a), when the 
e-brainstorming mechanism does not account for agent knowledge learning 
capabilities (i.e., the capability for continuous quality improvement is disabled), 
various relatively good performance of the e-brainstorming mechanism is attained 
(w.r.t. different numbers of participants involved) in both Average Service Types (e.g., 
3.7 > 2.77 when roles = 3) and Service Diversity Rate (46.25% > 34.58% when roles 
= 3) in comparison with the greedy approach. However, the results also reveal that the 
performance gap becomes small when the number of roles is increased. 
With agents’ capabilities to learn knowledge in e-brainstorming, the performance 
improvements are then increased (e.g., Table 2(b) shows the increased improvements

Sidebar#1:  Aging Service Technologies 
Aging service technologies improve the lives and societies by caring for aging 
populations, helping the elderly become healthy, independent, and have vigorous lives. 
These technologies can be utilized to create caregiver networks, enabling people to 
age in the comfort of their homes.  Examples of aging services technologies include 
relevant projects that utilize sensors and actuators to correlate with the aims of aging 
services technologies, such as monitoring occupants, communicating with occupants, 
and assisting occupants in their daily activities.  
There are two principal categories of aging services technologies: care-oriented 
technologies and environment-oriented technologies.  Care-oriented technologies 
support the professional needs and enhance quality of care and life in terms of 
cognitive perspective. For example, mobile technologies are utilized for cognitive 
assistance to Alzheimer’s patients. Environment-oriented technologies assist elderly 
people in living safely and actively with quality. 
 
Care-Oriented Technology 
z Autominder is a cognitive orthotic system developed by NASA JSC that helps 
aging adults adapt to cognitive declination and continue with routine activities 
[8]. The autominder provides adaptive/personalized reminders for daily living 
activities and maintains an accurate model of a client’s daily plans. 
z The Assisted Cognition project was developed to enhance the quality of life for 
people suffering from Alzheimer’s disease and similar cognitive disorders [5]. 
The systems developed can sense an individual’s location and environment, learn 
daily behaviors and help patients via various interventions.  
z The Nursebot project was developed at Carnegie Mellon University [9]. The 
project goal was the development of personal robotic aids that have five primary 
functions: cognitive prosthesis, safeguarding, systematic data collection, remote 
tele-medicine, and social interaction. 
z The UbiMon Project investigated healthcare delivery by combining wearable and 
implantable sensors (i.e., a body sensor network system) [7]. The project aim 
was to monitor patients under natural physiological states to detect and prevent 
transient but possibly life-threatening abnormalities.  
z The MiCare project is a patient-centric healthcare environment [12] that focuses 
on (1) seamless integration of care services and (2) context-aware authorization 
of healthcare records. The MiCare project seams the care services with multiple 
roles and manages healthcare records by authorization in different contexts.
