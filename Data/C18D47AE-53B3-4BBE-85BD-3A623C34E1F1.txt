Abstract 
Diamond like carbon (DLC) films is useful in many applications like optics, 
micro-electronics, tooling, the automobile industry. One drawback in DLC properties is its low 
toughness and high internal stress. To improve the mechanical properties in DLC, we spin coat 
the multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) (20-40 nm diameter, 5-15 m length, 95% purity) with 
0.015%, 0.025% and 0.05%wt solution on (100) silicon. DLC was deposited by plasma enhanced 
chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) with C2H2 and H2. The surface and mechanical properties of 
CNT doped DLC composite films were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, XPS, contact 
angle, nano-indentation and nanoscratch. The results show that the ID/IG and sp2/sp3 ratios are 
proportional to the CNT contents. For wettability and hydrogen content, the increase of CNT 
content will result in more hydrophobic and less hydrogen for CNT/DLC composite films. As for 
mechanical properties, the hardness and elastic modulus increases linearly with increasing CNT 
content. This is different from previous study where the inclusion of vertical CNT reduces the 
elastic modulus and the hardness. The discrepancy is explained by the anisotropic property of 
CNT and orientation. The friction coefficient is reduced for higher CNT content. In summary, the 
inclusion of horizontal CNT into DLC films increases the hardness, elastic modulus but reduces 
the hydrogen and friction coefficient. The surface and mechanical properties depend on the 
content and the orientation of the CNT and needs further investigation.

percentage (0.05wt%, 0.15wt%, 0.25wt%) solutions were spin coated under 4 different spin 
speed (1000 rpm, 2000 rpm, 3000 rpm, 4000 rpm). The content of the CNT is determined by the 
concentration of the solution and the spin coating speed. The exact percentage in CNT doped 
DLC is determined by the mass difference before and after the spin coating. The CNT weight 
percent ranges from 0.02wt% to 0.13wt%. The SEM of the spin coated CNT for different weight 
percentage is shown in Fig. 2. After CNT dispersion and spin coating, the DLC film was 
deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (CVD) with C2H2 and H2 gases at base 
pressure 10-3 Torr. The film thickness is controlled by the deposition time and the film thickness 
measured by surface profiler (Alpha-Step 500, KLA-Tencor) is 0.5m. Raman measurement was 
carried out with Renishaw-1000 type Raman spectrometer with wave length 514.5 nm. The 
wettability of the CNT doped DLC film was measured by AST VCA 2000 with de-ionized water 
and recorded by a CCD. The idle time is 30 seconds for stabilization of the water droplet. The sp3 
fraction and hydrogen content in CNT doped film is measured by XPS (ESCALAB 210) used A1 
K monochromatic X-ray source. The hardness and the elastic modulus were measured by 
nanoindentation (XE-100 TriboScope, Hysitron) using Berkovich indenter. Each reading is the 
average of ten experimental measurements. The friction coefficient is measured by a nanoscratch 
tester. 
  
3. Results and Discussion 
3.1 Surface properties of CNT doped DLC films 
The Raman spectra of DLC, CNT and CNT doped DLC is shown in Fig. 3. For DLC Raman 
spectrum, there exists a peak between 1200-1800 cm-1 which can be deconvoluted into 1350 cm-1 
D band and 1580 cm-1 G band. The Raman spectrum shows clear peak in 1350 cm-1 D band and 
1580 cm-1 G band. For CNT doped DLC, the G band moves towards high wave number while the 
intensity of D band increases. Based on these Raman spectra, the effect for different CNT content 
in ID/IG ratio is shown in Fig. 4. For low CNT content, the ID/IG ratio does not vary much. 
However, as the content of CNT increases, the ID/IG ratio increases linearly. This indicates that 
the increase of CNT will increase the intensity of D band which is a disordered low-energy band.

been observed for fiber-reinforced composite. Therefore, different CNT orientation doping should 
result in distinct mechanical property. The increase in sp2 content in greater CNT doping usually 
means the reduction of hardness. This seems to contradict the increasing hardness as found from 
nanoindentation. The anisotropic properties of CNT and the orientation might be the reason why 
the elastic modulus and hardness both increases. While the film composition might be softened 
by increasing sp2, the microstructure of horizontal CNT enhances the overall mechanical property. 
The friction coefficient for different CNT doped DLC is shown in Fig. 10. In general, the friction 
coefficient is decreasing for increasing CNT doping. The low friction coefficient and high 
hardness properties in CNT doped DLC is ideal for wear protection application. 
 
4. Conclusions 
The synthesis of CNT doped DLC is prepared by dispersion, spin coating and DLC 
deposition. The Raman spectra show the features of CNT doped DLC. The inclusion of horizontal 
CNT results in higher sp2 bonding and lower hydrogen content. It also leads to hydrophobic 
surface and lower fiction coefficient. The elastic modulus and hardness increase by higher CNT 
doping which are related to the anisotropic property and the orientation of CNT. The effect of 
anisotropy and orientation of CNT in CNT/DLC property can be modeled by a finite element 
analysis. This is currently under investigation.

Electric property
A microﬂuidic device was fabricated to separate different conducting parts of multi-walled carbon nanotubes
(MWCNTs). The device consists of a curing PDMS ﬂuidic-ﬂow chamber covered on electrode coated glass. The
electrode was designed to generate non-uniform electric ﬁeld by patterning via lithography. A range of
frequencies with low applied voltage was utilized to induce different sign of dielectrophoresis force. Two
different separation schemes based on positive and negative dielectrophoresis were employed to separate
different conducting parts in unsorted MWCNTs. From Raman spectroscopy, conducting MWCNTs collected
by positive dielectrophoresis showed little variation in the intensities of D-band and G-band ratio while the
less conducting MWCNTs collected by negative dielectrophoresis showed decreasing intensities in these
positions. The ID/IG ratio in the samples collected by both separation schemes is decreasing compared to the
unsorted samples. The electric properties of the samples were characterized by a dielectrophoresis frequency
spectra method. The conductance in positive dielectrophoresis collected sample is the greatest while the
conductance in negative dielectrophoresis collected sample is the smallest. The trend in the conductance in
unsorted and sorted samples is conﬁrmed by current-voltage measurements.

1. Introduction
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have recently attracted extensive
attention due to their unique mechanical, thermal and electrical
properties [1–3]. In optoelectronics applications like ﬁeld-effect
transistor or memory, metallic or semicoducting CNTs have been
utilized to enhance the performance of the device [4–7]. For good
performance, the uniformity in the material is very important.
Several chemical or physical puriﬁcation processes based on
chemical moieties [8,9], electric ﬁeld [10], or density gradients [11]
are available to purify CNTs. Even though each method has its own
merit and drawback, puriﬁcation based on the electric ﬁeld has the
advantages of simple fabrication and easy integration. Dielectrophor-
esis (DEP), a phenomenon resulted from the non-uniform electric
ﬁeld, has been used to deposit large number CNTs in ﬁeld-effect
transistors [12,13] and separate metallic from semiconducting CNTs
[14]. In this study, a method based on AC dielectrophoresis was
developed to separate different conducting parts of the multi-walled
CNTs (MWCNTs). Also the electric property of the sorted and unsorted
samples was evaluated by a dielectrophoresis frequency spectra
method and current-voltage curves.
2. Experimental procedure
The dielectrophoresis chip used for separation was fabricated via
MEMS technique. The advantages of MEMS for dielectrophoresis chip
fabrication are the reduction of applied voltage, less Joule heating due
to high surface to volume ratio and ease of scaling up for mass
production. The DEP chip was made of two parts. The electrode was
made from a Corning 1737 glass sputtered with Cr and patterned to an
interdigitated triangular shape through lithography. The ﬂuidic
chamber was made from a curing PDMS fabricated from a SU-8
mode. After the surface treatment of the ﬂuidic chamber via oxygen
plasma (Harrick, Scientiﬁc Plasma Cleaner), these two parts were
bonded together as a dielectrophoresis chip. The fabrication proce-
dure was shown in Fig. 1. The solutions of MWCNTs was prepared by
dispersing MWCNTs (NanoAmor, 95+%, OD 10–20 nm) 0.015 g into DI
water and mixed with alcohol 30 g and surfactant (Dodecylbenzene-
sulfonicacid, sodium salt) 1 g. The solutionwas then pipetted onto the
chip. AC electric ﬁelds were generated from a function generator
(Wavetek 195) for applied voltage 8 V under frequencies ranging from
25 Hz to 10 MHz. The signal was applied to the electrode to generate
dielectrophoresis reaction. The bonding structure in MWCNTs for
unsorted and sorted samples was characterized by Raman spectro-
scopy which was carried out by a Renishaw micro-Raman, with
514.5 nm laser excitation. The characterization of the electric property

move to the maxima of the electric ﬁeld and the less conducting CNT
will move to the minima of the electric ﬁeld under negative DEP. To
identify the sign of the DEP force, it is necessary to identify the
maxima and the minima of the electric ﬁeld. The distribution of the
strength of the electric ﬁeld in an interdigitated triangular electrode
was shown in Fig. 2 by a numerical simulation via CFD–ACE+ (CFD
research cooperation). In this patterned electrode, the maxima of the
electric ﬁeld occur in the sharp edge of the electrode (shown in red)
and the minima occur between the maxima (shown in blue). This
simulation provides a guideline to identify the sign of the dielec-
trophoresis. AC signals were applied at voltage 8 V under different
frequencies. The sign of the dielectrophoresis was determined based
on whether MWCNTs collected on the maxima or the minima in the
electric ﬁeld and the results for unsorted samplewere listed in Table 1.
Two micrographs for collected samples at 50 Hz and 1 kHz were
shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b) for demonstration purpose. The collected
samples under positive DEP and negative DEP were compared with
the unsorted samples via Raman spectra and the results were shown
in Fig. 4. The spectra shown that the relative intensities of the disorder
band (D-band) at 1335 cm−1 and the graphite band (G-band) at
1585 cm−1 exhibit little variation for samples collected by positive
