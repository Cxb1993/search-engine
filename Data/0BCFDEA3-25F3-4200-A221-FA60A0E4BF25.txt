2. 以三維系統思維建構企業系統整合性之產品設計鏈參考架構 
2.1 以 Normative-Prescriptive-Descriptive 三維決策理論建構研究的新架構 
以往將決策理論的研究分成二大類：規範性 (Normative) 及描述性
(Descriptive)。規範性理論著重的是結果的正確性，而描述性理論則是著重決策的
過程。規範性決策理論指出理性的決策者應該如何依據一組已良好定義的公理來
制定決策。「理性」的意義是指使成本最小化、利潤最大化等最佳化的思維。然而
在一系列的實驗心理學與行為科學的研究，藉由觀察人類實際的決策行為所得到
的二個結論是：人類資訊處理的能力是有限的、人類具適應能力。亦即，人類的
行為並不總是最佳化的，尤其當所處理的資訊量龐大時，此時人類會採用不同的
決策策略來減化資訊的處理、加速決策的制定；而且，人類具有學習能力，其行
為也不是一成不變的，而是依經驗、情境而改變。另一方面描述性的研究也指出
人類實際的決策問題與決策情境較規範性公理的假設複雜許多，因此人類在真實
的決策過程牽涉了許多的偏差(bias)。 
1983 年在哈佛商學院舉辦的決策研討會(Bell et al. 1988)“Decision Making: 
Descriptive, Normative, and Prescriptive Interactions”，該研討會首次將決策分類成
Descriptive, Normative 及 Prescriptive： 
(1) 描述性(Descriptive)： 
a. 人們所做的決策(Decisions people make) 
b. 人們如何做決策(How people decide) 
(2) 規範性(Normative)： 
a. 邏輯一致的決策程序(Logically consistent decision procedures) 
b. 人們應該如何做決策(How people should decide) 
(3) 指示性(Prescriptive)： 
a. 如何協助人們做好的決策(How to help people to make good decisions) 
b. 如何訓練人們做更佳的決策(How to train people to make better decisions)

辨識與產生準確的預測來描繪未來。如果預測是針對各別的產業，這個就是「產
業發展路徑圖」。對於特定的產品方案，結合市場地位與技術趨勢，則構成了“產
品技術發展路徑圖”。這個路徑圖標示出產品世代與技術世代的關鍵性。最後一個
是「產品發展路徑圖」它以清晰的產品演進方向與時程，來與外部顧客與內部顧
客溝通。 
多數產品的產品生命週期愈來愈短，而上市時間(Time-to-Market)已成為一項
關鍵競爭因素。接單生產(Build-to-Order, BTO)與接單組裝(Configure-to-Order, 
CTO)更已成為企業展現差異化能力的實務作法。生產模式已從大量生產轉移至大
量客製化。因此新產品開發(New Product Development, NPD)專案具有策略意義，
已成為管理實務上一項非常具挑戰性的工作。不論是產品或管理體系，都是某種
類型的系統。 
張延欣等(1997)闡述系統論(Systemology)是研究一切系統的一般模式、原則和
規律的理論體系。它包括系統概念、一般系統理論(General Systems Theory)、系
統方法論和系統方法的應用等。其任務就是確定適合於各種系統的一般方法論及
原則。謝長宏(1999)認為，系統論是研究「一般性系統」各組成元素間的關係，
而一般系統理論則是研究科學各學門(Scientific Disciplines)知識間的關係。張延欣
等[8]認為：分析(Analysis)著重在功能面上，從系統外部描述系統整體的特徵；綜
合(Synthesis)著重在結構面上，從系統內部描述系統整體的性質；評價(Evaluation)
則著重在整體，評價對象的價值不是對象本身所固有的，而是評價對象和它所處
的環境條件的相互關係及相對的屬性。系統評價，就是評定系統各備選方案的價
值，也就是利用模型(Model)及各種資料，根據技術、經濟、環境等方面的客觀要
求，從系統整體出發，分析比較各備選方案，權衡(Trade-Off)各方案的利弊得失，
並考量成本效益等，選出最適(Optimal)方案的過程。 
系統工程與其他工程學不同之點在於它是跨越許多學科的科學，設計複雜系
統時，應有明確的預定功能及目標，並協調各個元素之間及元素和整體之間的有
機聯繫，以使系統能從總體上達到最優目標。在設計系統時，要同時考慮到參與
 15
展路徑圖規劃分析的主題。就預測而言，技術的演化是一件被預期發生的事，也
就是說技術發展路徑圖的本質是機率性甚至隨機性的。從組織的觀點，發展路徑

圖 4 發展路徑圖之層次(Lee et al., 2005) 
 
企業集團發展路徑圖、策略事業單位發展路徑圖與功能部門發展路徑圖，即
相對於管理策略，而技術發展路徑圖通常關聯於生產與研發功能部門。科技發展
路徑圖是為了求取正確的答案，產業發展路徑則是一個適合的工具來描繪產業情
境。產品技術發展路徑圖能夠以一個實務的方式來形塑企業的未來，產品發展路
徑圖則為企業提供一個市場競爭態勢。一個複雜系統之新產品開發專案的規劃與
執行，必須先取得企業策略與技術策略的一致性。 
 
 17
 
產品技術發展路徑圖可以用來為產品選擇適當的技術，並且型塑企業的未
來，而產品發展路徑圖則為產品的市場定位提供分析性的訊息，因此從而協助選
擇適當的產品平台與上市時程。產品平台的衍生物，也就是產品家族可以為企業
鎖定特定市場區隔。每一個產品家族有它的共通結構，這個結構則有世代型的演
進。在這個共通的結構之下是主要的次系統與介面，它們提供了產品主要的功能。
藉由在次系統及介面上應用新科技或新服務產品因而衍生出各種變化。共通結構
的次系統與介面成為基構模組，它們形成企業的核心技術與關鍵流程，也發展成
企業的核心競爭力，而成為企業策略規劃的重要一環。 
每一個發展路徑圖都有其相對應於上市時間的產品完成時程，根據這個時
程，A-WBS 將用反向排程的方法來規劃產品開發活動的排程。 
根據 P-WBS 的系統、組件與零組件與供應商之關係，定義出兩類採購點：A
採購點係與無設計變更之零組件，B 採購點係與設計變更相關之零組件。配合產

4.1 建構供應鏈需求不確定情況下之最適生產量模式 
企業想要在新產品的開發中獲利，必需要能配合顧客的喜好，企業才能在顧
客需求快速變化的環境中保持優勢。本研究將針對筆記型電腦經過設計與改良之
新產品在其設計初期分兩階段找出不同產品之最適生產量。第一階段將發展通用
 21
新的創新產品，此類產品約佔所有新產品的10%。 
2. 公司的新產品線（New product line）：使公司進入某現有市場之新產品，此
類產品約佔所有新產品的20%。 
3. 既有產品線外所增加之產品（Additions to existing product lines）：在現有產
品線中增加產品線的完整程度，對市場而言並非全新，此類產品約佔所有新
產品的26%。 
4. 既有產品的改良與修正（Improvement in revision to existing product）：提供
改進性能的新產品，以取代公司現有的某些產品，約佔所有新產品的26%。 
5. 產品的重新定位（Reposition）：將現有產品以促銷活動等方式導入新市場或
新市場區隔，此類產品約佔所有新產品的7%。 
6. 成本降低（Cost reduction）：產品重新設計以提供功能類似但成本降低之新
產品，約佔所有新產品的11%。 
產品設計初期考慮問題 
此外根據 Shehab and Abdalla (2001)的研究，指出產品的製造成本超過 70％在
設計階段就已經被決定，但是在設計階段的成本卻只是佔整個產品發展成本的 6
％，由此可見設計階段對整個產品發展的重要性，而在設計初期的概念設計在整
個設計過程中更是扮演承上啟下的角色。概念設計階段需要儘量將各種可能的方
案予以量化評估，可估計使各種成本能清楚估計，使各種浪費減至最低。因此，
如何在產品設計方案尚未確定時，將各種生產參數加以量化，以求得最適之設計
方案，是產品開發過程中的重要問題。學者於產品設計初期考量成本之相關問題，

圖 8  研究流程圖 
本研究所探討之數學模式可分兩階段進行，主要是運用於不同之供應鏈網路
最低生產總成本分析與多產品規劃初期最適生產量決定。因為在不同策略下，會
造成不同之生產總成本 Pagh and Copper(1998)，因此，第一階段以製造成本、配
送成本與存貨成本之總和求得最低生產總成本為目標；第二階段考量第一階段求
得之最低生產總成本區間、需求區間、單位需求價格區間、每單位變動成本與希
望達到純益區間進行單一期間內最適生產量之決定。 
本研究建構通用之供應鏈結構如圖 9 所示，編號 1~n 代表 K 種產品所需使用
的共同使用原物料/零組件；而編號 n+1~m 代表 L 種差異化的原物料/零組件（假

4. 因為每個製造流程皆觀察下游存貨水準來決定是否進行製造補貨動作，
因此不考慮製造上限的問題。 
5. 在配送流程方面如果有出現需大量配送的情形，可以利用加班的方式解
決，因此節線點上的物流配送量亦不設上限。

選用此策略時會有較高配送成本與較高製造成本。 
 
(1)模式相關參數說明 
原料供應商以提供NB主要零組件的廠商地區為主，這些供應商來自世界各地，因
此在物料配送方面較複雜、成本也較高。供應商供應之零組件價格並非都是買方
市場，部分重要零件如CPU其價格則取決於Intel的市場機能，NB製造廠影響力較
小。另外A公司生產的筆記型電腦型號類別眾多，因此使用的零組件種類也多，
本研究僅依其功能釐列價格範圍，所有NB電腦使用的零組件都是依據客戶需求，
在最小成本原則下組合， 
運送距離(時間相關資料) 
本研究中A公司海外零組件供應為了時效性，全部以空運；台灣對大陸的成品運

車運送。距離預估以最短運送時間估算，運送距離單位以公里計算。 
其他參數 
需求區間以A公司每年7~9月之單一型號銷售最佳情況推估而得，單位需求價

據A公司財務報表年平均值而得，如表6所示；而假設該公司之資金上限為200百
萬元。

費者購買意願偏低；反之，單位可能售價平均低於最佳解單位可能售價 100

以上，因此，決策者應可採行比最佳解略高於 100 元左右之單位可能售價，
可獲得合理之利潤。

b.單位變動成本之敏感度分析與決策建議

實際狀況。 
3. 利用 CVP 模式可探討單位需求價格區間、每單位變動成本、生產總成本區
間、希望達到純益區間與生產資金上限等受限於多產品可能性分配之 CVP
模式，在產品設計初期階段時，能考量不同參數變化情形，決定在期間內下

參數變化以獲得對利潤影響情形。 
 
4.2 建構採購績效模式 
有了審閱平台可以提供即時的審查意見，縮短開發時程，但與不同供應商之
合作過程應予以進行績效評估，以建立長期的中衛體系合作關係。因此有需要建
立一套有系統、適切的新產品導入協同開發中有關供應商協同設計與供料之績效
評估模式，以協助廠商有效率地評估及監控供應商之協同設計與供料狀況。 
在產品設計鏈模式中，依據圖 6 所示可以明瞭採購部門在整條設計鏈中主要
的活動有兩項，在本研究中分別把它分別定義為採購點 A 與採購點 B。在採購點
A 的部份主要是向供應商採購市售商品(Commercial of the Shelf, COTS)，而在採
購點 B 的部份，由於廠商自身 A-WBS 及合約外包之協同合作 C-WBS 會涉及許
多員工的活動，因此藉由此階段來與其他各部門的成員進行審閱。 
在了解採購部門於設計鏈所需執行的活動後，本研究訪問業界採購人員及參
照採購行為與相關文獻，將採購一般屬性、零組件類型與 A、B 採購點整理如表
9 所示。採購合約之主要項目可分為技術規範、財務條款及商業條款： 
¾ 技術規範著重之屬性為品質 
¾ 財務條款著重之屬性為成本 
¾ 商業條款著重之屬性為交期與服務

a. 外購零組件  
b. 按 C 類零組件劃分

b. 緊急採購指標：緊急採購方式的費用與正常運輸方式的差額

d. 除了前述指標的直接損失，尚有間接損失 
(4) 價格績效 
a. 企業最重視的指標 
b. 實際價格與標準成本的差距 
c. 實際價格與過去移動平均價格的差額 
d. 比較過去使用時的價格與採購時之價格的差額 
e. 將當期採購價格與基期採購價格之比率與當期物價指數與基期物價指數之比

(5) 採購效率指標 
a. 採購金額 
b. 採購金額佔銷貨收入的百分比 
c. 訂購單的件數

e. 採購部門的費用 
f. 新廠商開發個數 
g. 採購完成率 
h. 錯誤採購次數 
i. 訂單處理時間 
4.5 採購績效模式 
根據組織內部採購管理程序(王忠宗，1999)與上述績效指標分析本研究建立
一採購績效模式架構如圖14。 
 47
 
圖 15 採購知識管理系統流程(曾昇郁，2006) 
 
圖 16 系統主畫面(曾昇郁，2006)

經由採購知識管理系統的建立，可以快速的讓使用者找到所需要的知識，可
藉由不斷的更新資料庫中可以讓新產品開發的時間縮短，提升企業在新產品開發
上的競爭力。 
5. 結論與未來研究方向 
整個供應鏈體系中，與供應商協同開發新產品扮演重要的角色，而許多企業
於新產品開發的過程中，沒有訂定一套系統化的流程與供應商協同開發，也沒有
系統化的方法針對供應商協同開發作知識的累積與管理，所以本研究從總體策略
面著手，以三維決策理論為基礎，建構從管理發展路徑圖、技術發展路徑圖、系
統工程管理、產品開發管理以及供應商協同新產品開發管理的校準模式(Strategic 
Alignment Model for New Product Development, SAM-NPD)，並配合總計畫建立設
計審閱平台以及採購知識管理系統，以期增加新產品開發之績效。 
透過資訊系統的開發建立，本計畫之成果如下： 
1. 使新產品開發專案可以更有效的掌握流程的進度，而且在可以淸楚的了解目
前專案的達成度。 
2. 連結企業新產品開發與供應商評選，讓採購部門在選擇供應商時可以更加的
快速，同時也可以讓企業的策略展開至供應商，以提升企業新產品的競爭力。 
3. 藉由知識的儲存讓後續的使用者在找尋解決問題的方法可以更加的快速及便
利。 
4. 專案的開發因為使用本研究的方法而可以縮短專案開發所需要的時間，加快
產品上市的時間。 
5. 可以早點找到顧客需求與零組件的衝突點而進行改善，早點可以發現設計上
的缺失，提早作設計變更。 
未來可以進行的研究，建議以既有架構，朝向綠色電子業的系統化研究，以
提升我國產業競爭力。

a means of determining that a malfunction positively exists)? Are continuous 
performance monitoring provisions incorporated where appropriate? 
22.5 Are test points provided to enable checkout and fault isolation beyond the level of 
self-test? Test points for fault isolation within an assembly should not be 
incorporated if the assembly is to be discarded at failure. Test-point provisions 
must be compatible with the level of repair analysis. 
22.6 Are test points accessible? Accessibility should be compatible with the extent of 
maintenance performed. Test points on the operator’s front panel are not 
required for a depot maintenance action. 
22.7 Are test points functionally and conveniently grouped to allow for sequential 
testing (following a signal flow), testing of similar functions, or frequency of use 
when access is limited? 
22.8 Are test points provided for direct testing of all replaceable items? 
22.9 Are test points adequately labeled? Each test point should be identified with a 
unique number, and the proper signal or expected measured output should be 
specified on a label located adjacent to the test point.
