the local dynamics of each fuzzy rule by a 
linear model. The appeal of the T-S fuzzy 
model in control design is that the stability 
and performance characteristics of a system 
can be verified by using a Lyapunov 
function approach [2-7]. The basic idea of 
existing control design methodology is to 
design a feedback gain for each local model 
and then to construct a global controller 
from these local gains so that the global 
stability of the overall fuzzy system is 
guaranteed. Such a control design approach 
easily leads to a set of coupled matrix 
inequalities that include both a common 
positive definite matrix and each feedback 
gain in each fuzzy rule. However, it is easy 
to see that when the number of rules become 
large, the problem may become difficult to 
solve. For example, when there are many 
fuzzy rules in the considered system, the 
number of matrix inequalities needed to be 
satisfied simultaneously is also large, and it 
is very difficult to obtain the desired 
solution. In fact, for some more complicated 
nonlinear systems, the more rules is required 
in the T-S model with linear consequent 
parts to describe the system under a 
sufficient accuracy. Nevertheless, it should 
be noted that in a T-S fuzzy model, the 
consequence could be any functions. Thus, 
this project attempts to study the control 
design problem, in which the consequences 
of T-S models with nonlinear dynamic 
systems are used to represent the considered 
systems. Hence, for some complicated 
nonlinear systems, a T-S model with the 
nonlinear consequences may need fewer 
rules to model. 
Most plants in the industry have severe 
nonlinearity and uncertainties. The design of 
controllers for such systems is difficult and 
complicated. During last decades, various 
approaches have been proposed to overcome 
those difficulties in the control design for 
nonlinear systems with uncertainty. Fuzzy 
control is one of them. It can provide an 
effective solution to the control of plants 
that are complex, uncertain, and ill defined. 
It is because a complex system is usually 
decomposed into several simple subsystems 
in a fuzzy control approach and a simple 
control law is then employed to emulate the 
human control strategy in each subsystem. 
Polytopes of matrices are now established as 
one of standard representations of 
uncertainties involved in state-space models 
of control systems [16-18]. In the past few 
years, the controllers synthesis and stability 
analysis problems for polytopic linear 
systems have received considerable attention 
[18-26]. The Lyapunov theory is the main 
method for these kinds of problems. Some 
researchers use parameter independent 
Lyapunov functions to investigate the 
stability domains of polytopic linear systems. 
This kind of Lyapunov function approach 
can be employed to design robust state 
feedback controllers [18-19]. Especially, 
when the considered uncertain parameters 
vary fast, this approach provides not too 
conservative results. However, applying a 
single Lyapunov function to the analysis of 
stability and the design of controllers for 
polytopic linear systems with slow-varying 
or constant uncertain parameters leads to an 
overdesign [19]. Less conservative results 
 4
described by fuzzily “blending” those local 
models. In this project we consider a more 
general case. Namely, in each fuzzy rule, a 
simple nonlinear model is given to describe 
a complex nonlinear system locally. For 
some complex nonlinear systems, this 
modeling method can reduce the number of 
fuzzy rules. 
An IF-THEN rule of the T-S fuzzy 
model with single-input polytopic nonlinear 
consequences is represented as

III. MAIN RESULTS 
The concept of CLFs introduced by 
Artstein [15] has played a prominent role in 
recent development of robust nonlinear 
control. We now review the concept of CLFs 
as follows. 
Consider the multiple input 
continuous-time affine systems 
 6
such that the closed-loop system

nonlinear controller iu , for ri ,,2,1 …= ,

From the above discussions, we can 
conclude that if there exists a CLF ( )V x  
satisfying this condition 
( ) 0b x = ( ) 0a x⇒ < , then the nonlinear 
feedback controller ( )iu x  in each fuzzy 
rule can be obtained directly by using (14)

B. T-S Fuzzy Model with single-input 
polytopic Linear Consequences  
For the special case that the T-S fuzzy 
models possess linear consequence functions, 
we give the following results. A typical 
IF-THEN rule of the T-S fuzzy model with 
linear consequences is represented as 
Rule i: IF 1 1( ) is   and ... ( ) is

It is obvious that (13) is a special form 
of (2) if ( )i if x A x=  and ( )i ig x B= . 
Similarly, we can obtain a fuzzy 
controller for T-S fuzzy model with linear 
consequences. For a system as (13), the 
controller for Rule i is  
IF 1 1( ) is   and ... ( ) is 
i i
n nx t M x t M  
THEN ( ) ( ( ))iu t u x t= , ri ,,2,1 …= . (14) 
Then, the overall output of this fuzzy
