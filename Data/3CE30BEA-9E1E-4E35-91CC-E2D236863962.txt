Abstract: Single and three-phase inverters are extensively 
employed in many plants. To meet the required characteristics of 
different kinds of loads, suitable power quality control for 
inverter output is indispensable, even for its voltage waveform. 
There are many factors affecting the waveform and quality of an 
inverter, such as filter design, PWM control approach, blanking 
time effect, ferro-resonance caused by output transformer, 
fluctuation and ripple of DC-link voltage, nonlinear load effect, 
unbalanced load effect, system parameter variations and 
uncertainties. The major purposes of this project lie in: (i) 
development of single and three-phase inverter modules; (ii) 
design and implementation of key inverter constituted 
components; (iii) robust waveform control against load and input 
variations; (iv) robust waveform control against nonlinear and 
unbalanced load effects; (v) robust waveform control against 
output transformer effects; (vi) operation and control for the 
three-phase inverters formed from the connection of single-phase 
modules; (vii) the study of modular connection of single-phase 
inverter modules.  
The works arranged in the first year project are: (i) survey of 
the existing single-phase inerter circuits and their controls, the 
key factors affecting the single-phase inverter output voltage 
control characteristics, the key match issues between the inverter 
and its input source and load; (ii) design of output filter; (iii) 
source interface converter circuit; (iv) establishment of digital 
control environment and its performance evaluation; (v) design 
of switching scheme; (vi) design of robust current and voltage

control, voltage control, disturbance observer based robust 
control, waveform control, nonlinear load effect, discrete control,

1. Motivation and purpose (研究動機及目的) 
Depending on the output voltage and frequency 
characteristics, inverter is extensively employed in 
uniterruptible power supply (UPS), electronic ballast, 
motor drives, shaker, audio class-D amplifier, AC test 
source, AC module in distributed power system, etc. The 
output waveform and dynamic performance of an inverter 
are dependent on the designed circuit components, the 
PWM switching approach and the control technique being 
applied [1-5]. In circuit arrangement, the full-bridge or 
H-bridge circuit is optimal in energy conversion and 
control flexibility [5]. By using unipolar voltage switching 
control, the harmonic frequency can be made higher, and it 
is beneficial in the reductions of output filter size, voltage 
switching stress and electromagnetic interference (EMI). 
Recently, the single-phase H-bridge inverter is extensively 
employed as an AC module or power electronics building 
block (PEBB) in cascaded inverters [6,7] and renewable 
distributed power network. Therefore, it is very important 
to establish an H-bridge module with excellent waveform 
control characteristics. 
In addition to the switching approach, there exist many 
issues affecting the output voltage waveform quality of an 
inverter, such as: (i) Filter design: in the study made in [8], 
the filter design is made taking the total harmonic content 
and reactive power requirement into account. In [9], the 
nonlinear load current effects are further considered; (ii) 
The analysis and compensation control for an inverter 
with output transformer have been made in [10]. Wherein 
the cause of imbalance is studied in detail, and then a DC 
current is injected to the sinusoidal control voltage to 
achieve the compensation control. However, the output 
voltage quality under nonlinear load is not evaluated; (iii) 
The effects of DC-link voltage fluctuation; (iv) The cause, 
effect and compensation control of dead-time [1,11]. In 
this project, the compensations for dead-time, output low 
frequency transformer and nonlinear load effects on the 
inverter output voltage waveform will be achieved 
equivalently via the proposed robust control approach. 
Having properly constructed the power circuit and 
switching scheme of an inverter, the sophisticated and 
robust controls are indispensable to yield better output 
voltage waveform. The existing voltage control

and controller design for these two loops are described as 
followed. 
 
A. Current Control Scheme 
System configuration of the proposed current robust 
waveform control scheme is shown in the right lower part 
of Fig. 2(a). The ramp comparison current-controlled 
pulse-width modulation (CCPWM) scheme is adopted, 
and its control scheme consists of a proportional- 
plus-integral (PI) current feedback controller (CFBC) 
)(sGcbi  and a current command feedforward controller 
(CCFC) )(sGcfi . In the inverter model shown in Fig. 2(a), 
)(sH pi  and )(sH pv  denote the transfer functions from 
)(svcont  to )(siL  and from )(siL  to )(svo , respectively.

(a) Plant Model Estimation 
By removing the voltage control loop and the CCFC, 
the equivalent feedback loop block diagram of current 
loop is drawn in Fig. 3(a). Let the current loop be opened 
at point ○A , W= 2.94oR  and ¥=nR (about half load), 
and a small perturbated AC signal contvD  ( rmsV354.0 , 
kHzHzf 2~10= ) be added to a constant command contv  
( rmsV05.3 , Hz60 ), the control system analyzer HP3563A 
is used to measure the frequency response and estimate the 
following plant model transfer function:

The frequency response properties of )(ˆ sH pi  are found 
to be: (i) Having complex conjugate poles: 
579.880588.5612,1 jp ±-= ; (ii) The magnitude response 
is almost flat within the main dynamic frequency range 
Hzf 2000 ££ , and the two typical values are: 
0487.0)602(ˆ »´pjH pi , 035.0)0(ˆ =piH  (3) 
(b) Design of Controllers 
(1) CFBC )(sGcbi   
For the ease of design and implementation, the current 
feedback controller is chosen to be the PI type:

KKsG Iipicbi +=)(  
 
(4) 
The design is made at the load case with W= 2.94oR  
and ¥=nR . Using Fig. 3(a) and (2), by first choosing the 
proportional gain, then the integral gain is determined with 
the help of simulation to be:  
s

The resulted closed-loop system transfer function 
possesses the crossover frequency )067.0(1 sc fkHzf »=  
and the phase margin of o8.22 at Hz414 . 
 
(2) CCFC )(sGcfi   
According to (2) and (3), to yield excellent command 
feedforward control for main dynamic frequency range, 
the CCFC is set as: 
5339.20))602(ˆ()( 1 =´= -pjHsG picfi  (6) 
And the the remaining tracking error due to imperfect 
feedforward control will be automatically regulated by the 
feedback control. The experimental results presented later 
will show that very close current command tracking 
control under various cases can be achieved by this 
designed control scheme.

results in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) indicate that unsatisfactory 
waveform tracking responses are obtained by applying 
PI-control only. 
 
(2) The proposed control scheme: VFBC )(sGcbv + VCFC 
)(sGcfv + VRDFC + VRWC 
Let the VFBC be augmented with VCFC, VRDFC and 
VRWC, the measured results at the same conditions as 
those of Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) are plotted in Figs. 5(a) and 
5(b). The comparison between Figs. 4 and 5 indicates that 
significant improvement in voltage waveform and 
dynamic regulation control performances are achieved by 
the proposed control scheme. The gradual improvement in 
control performance by gradually applying VCFC, 
VRDFC and VRWC can be confirmed from the 
experimental results, which are not shown here due to the 
limit of scope.

(b) With Output Transformer 
Now let the output transformer be connected to provide 
electrical isolation and the DC-link voltage is set as 
VVdc 300= . At the same load cases as those set in Figs. 4 
and 5, the measured results by the feedback controller 
)(sGcbv  only and the proposed control scheme are 
compared in Figs. 6 and 7. The results indicate that: (i) the 
distorted voltage waveforms are found, particularly for the 
cases with feedback controller only. This is mainly due to 
the nonlinear magnetic behavior of output transformer and 
the ferroresonance between it and the load capacitor; and 
(ii) the waveform quality has been much improved by the 
proposed control approach. Moreover, the voltage 
regulation dynamic response improvements in less dip and 
faster restoration are also very significant.

B. Special Waveform Tracking Control Characteristics 
(a) Magnitude Step Response at Fixed Frequency 
  In making the audio susceptibility or line regulation test 
for various kinds of switching mode power supplies, the 
step change in magnitude at fixed frequency is necessary. 
To verify this ability of the developed inverter with the 
proposed control scheme, Figs. 8(a) and 8(b) show the 
measured output voltage responses ( HzV 60/220 ) of the 
developed inverter without and with output transformer 
due to a step magnitude change from V220  to V242  
( %10  rise) at load case 2 ( W1017 ). Very quick tracking 
responses are observed from the results.

(1036.4W). Very good static and dynamic voltage 
waveforms of the developed digital inverter can be 
observed from the results.   
 
2.5. Front AC/DC Converter 
As generally recognized, the DC-link of inverter 
established using switch-mode rectifier (SMR) can yield 
good input power quality and provide well-regulated input 
voltage for the inverter. The SMRs can be categorized into 
[35-37]: (i) buck, boost or buck/boost types; (ii) isolated 
or nonisolated types; (iii) one or multiple quadrant; (iv) 
one or multiple stage; (iv) low- and high-frequency, the 
former is simple owing to the lack of current control loop, 
but it suffers from having low voltage regulation control 
performance and low line drawn power quality. The 
development of SMR in this application is worth further 
studying.

3. Conclusion and Discussion (結論與討論) 
The robust waveform control for an single-phase 
isolated inverter under unknown, varying and nonlinear 
loads has been studied in this project. First, the circuit 
components and the 2DOF current controlled PWM 
scheme are properly designed to let the developed inverter 
possess excellent current waveform tracking performance. 
To handle the robust control against the uncertain and 
nonlinear load effects, an observer-based robust 
disturbance feedforward controller and a robust waveform 
controller are developed. An institutive approach, which is 
beneficial for a practical power electronic engineer, is 
suggested to find the parameters in the proposed control 
scheme. In performance evaluation, the static, transient, 
swept-sine and arbitrary waveform tracking responses 
under various load cases are all provided. The results 
indicated that good and robust waveform tracking controls 
are obtained by the developed inverter. 
Additionally, the developments of a V-connected 
three-phase inverter and a DSP-based single-phase 
inverter and their performance evaluations have also been 
performed in this project.
