Abstract: This paper describes the use of a single-beam optical 
tweezer to measure the interactive forces between two Jurkat cells 
(white blood cells with diameter of 14 μm). Experimental indicate that 
a laser power of 1.5 mW was sufficient to trap individual Jurkat cells. 
The laser power of 10.0 mW generates a dragging force of 0.12 pN. 
Separating two mutually attached Jurkat cells requires a laser power of 
4.0 mW. Experimental results that as the adhesion time of the two 
Jurkat cells is increased, the separation power also increases. In 
addition, a single-beam optical tweezer was integrated with a 
micromachined Fresnel zone plate. The trapping of Jurkat cells in a 
culture solution using a micromachined Fresnel zone plate was 
demonstrated. The advantages of the Fresnel zone plate are its much 
smaller thickness and weight, the flexibility of the lithographic process, 
and the ease with which they can be integrated into microfluidic chips.  
 
1. Introduction 
In the field of the mechanics of biological cells, much attention has been paid to 
how cells regulate their migration, deformation, exocytosis and endocytosis, and how 
changes in the components of a cell membrane affect their mechanical properties. 
These mechanical characteristics of living cells are known to influence strongly their 
chemical and biological functions. However, limitations of manipulation method have 
prevented the details of the biomechanics of cells from becoming well known. Since 
Ashkin et al. introduced optical traps in 1986 [1], optical tweezers have become 
indispensable tools for a wide range of interdisciplinary studies, such as the 
exploration of weak interactive forces [2], and the manipulation of single cells [3]. 
The use of optical tweezers technique is predicated on the fact that when photons in a 
laser beam pass through a high-refractive-index dielectric object, they undergo a 
change in momentum, exerting a force on the object and pushing it towards the focal 
point of the laser beam. Therefore, the object becomes “trapped” by the laser beam. 
Optical trapping has now become a common and useful tool in cell biology, allowing

diffraction patterns that are obtained by a CCD camera when the zone plate is 
illuminated by a collimated laser beam (λ=671 nm). 
Figure 3 schematically depicts the setup of an optical tweezer with a Fresnel 
zone plate. The laser beam passes through an inverted beam expander to produce a 
parallel beam with a diameter of 250 μm, which exceeds the 200 μm diameter of the 
zone plate such that the beam completely covers the plate. A liquid cell is formed by 
sandwiching a layer of culture solution between the zone plate substrate and a PDMS 
microfluidic channel. Jurkat cells with diameters of 14 μm are trapped at the zone 
plate focus. A filter is used to block the laser interference. The visible light from the 
illuminator is scattered by the trapped cells, forming an image at a CCD camera. 
 
3. Results and Discussion 
Since red light can cause slight damage when used in microbiological 
manipulation, the survival time of Jurkat cells were measured, as shown in Fig. 4. 
First, the developed optical tweezer was used to trap Jurkat cells that were suspended 
in culture solution at room temperature. A laser power of 1.5 mW was sufficient to 
trap a 14-μm-diameter Jurkat cell. The strength of this trap was measured by firstly 
trapping and then translating the cells at increasing speeds through the liquid medium 
and observing the point at which the fluidic drag exceeded the optical trapping force. 
The drag force of a uniform sphere that is moving through a viscous fluid can be 
approximated as FD=6rπηυ [13], where r is the radius of the sphere, η is the fluid 
viscosity, and υ is the flow velocity. In the calculation of trapping force, the drag force 
on the sphere was assumed to equal the optical trapping force. Figure 5 plots the 
dragging force on the trapped Jurkat cells as a function of laser power, which ranges 
from 1.5 to 80 mW. The linear curve yields a power-normalized force of 0.0099 
pN/mW.  
One Jurkat cell is trapped and then the stage is moved until it is in contact with 
another Jurkat cell. A few minutes are allowed to pass during which the cells is not 
irradiated, then the two attached cells that are separated. Figure 6 presents a sequence 
of images of the dynamic manipulation of trapped Jurkat cells. Experiments indicate 
that separating two Jurkat cells that adhere to each other requires a laser power of 4.0 
mW. However, as the adhesion time of two Jurkat cells is increased, the separation 
power also increases. Figure 7 presents the experimental results. We found that there 
is a linear incremental trend between the adhesion time increment of two Jurkat cells 
and separation power. 
In this study, a single-beam optical tweezer that is integrated with a 
micromachined Fresnel zone plate is designed and demonstrated. Figure 8 shows the
