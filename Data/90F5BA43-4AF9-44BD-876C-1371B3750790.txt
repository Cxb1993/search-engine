harvesting and electron generation/transfer. 
The electrolyte, containing a redox couple 
I3-/I- mediator, is injected into the slit between 
the anode and the catalytic Pt counter 
electrode. A dye sensitizer needs efficient 
charge injection with photoexcitation.2 To 
obtain high conversion efficiencies, it requires 
that the photogenerated electrons flow into the 
oxide film with minimal losses to interfacial 
recombination.3 
  Ruthenium-complexes sensitizers exhibit 
efficient charge injection after 
photoexcitation,2 which is grafted onto the 
semiconductor through anchoring groups, e.g. 
carboxylate that bind strongly to the oxide by 
coordination of surface titanium ions. Owing 
to the use of rare metals and the difficulty of 
purification, many metal-free dyes have been 
investigated.7-12 Among these dyes, the 
efficiencies achieved with the indoline dye4,5 
are even higher than the highest reported 
values for ruthenium-dye DSSCs. In addition, 
this dye has the advantage that it can be 
produced at low cost, because it does not 
contain the expensive rare metal ruthenium 
and it is easy to synthesize. On the other hand, 
room temperature ionic liquid-based 
electrolytes have been developed to contribute 
in this field.6  
實驗方法與步驟
 
   Anatase TiO2 has been proved the 
optimum choice of the semiconductor oxide 
for DSSCs.6 TiO2 anatase derived from 
titanate is expected to be phase pure and 
structure perfect resulting in a low electron 
trap density. To prepare the titanate precursor, 
3 g of a TiO2 powder (P25, Degussa) was 
treated with 100 ml of 10 N NaOH in an 
autoclave at 130oC for 20 h, followed by 
washing with 0.1 N HNO3 to reach a pH 
value of 1.5. The TiO2 colloid was obtained 
by autoclaving the titanate suspension at 
240oC for 24h.. The TiO2 colloid was mixed 
with polyethylene glycol (PEG-20000, 
Aldrich) to form a viscous TiO2 dispersion at 
a PEG/TiO2 ratio of 0.25. The dispersion was 
then spread onto a conducting glass substrate 
(F-doped SnO2 overlayer glass, 10Ω/□, 
Solaronix) to form a TiO2 film of 0.5 × 0.5 
cm2. The film was calcined at 450oC in air for 
30 min to form a mesoporous electrode with 
thickness of ~ 5 μm..  
To prepare triphenylamine-based indoline 
dye (TPAR), 15 mL of glacial acetic acid 
were added to 150 mg (0.55 mmol) of 
4-formaltriphenylamine and 110 mg (0.57 
mmol) of rhodanine-3-acetic acid and the 
solution was refluxed for 3 h in the presence 
of 100 mg of ammonium acetate as shown in 
Scheme 1. After cooling to room temperature, 
the mixture was poured into ice water. The 
precipitate was filtered and washed with 
distilled water. After drying under vacuum, 
the precipitate was purified by 
recrystallization from ethanol, obtaining red 
crystals of TPAR (190 mg, 75%). 1HNMR 
(400 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ (ppm) 4.69 (2H, 
s, －CH2COOH), 6.9 (2H, d, J=8.0 Hz, ArH), 
7.20 (6H, q, J=19.2 Hz, ArH), 7.39 (4H, t, 
J=14.8 Hz, ArH), 7.50 (2H, d, J=8.4 Hz, ArH), 
7.73 (1H, s, －CH＝). 13C NMR (DMSO-d6, 
δ, ppm): 118.6 (C7), 125.9 (C2), 126.8 (C3), 
129.0 (C6), 130.5 (C1), 131.7 (C4), 146.0 (C5), 
153.2 (C8), 191.0 (C9).  
  Commercial TiO2 (P25, Degussa) was used 
for the preparation of the nanocrystalline films. 
The TiO2 paste consisting of 18% P25 and 
4.5% ethyl cellulose in terpineol was first 
prepared, which was spin-coated onto a 
fluorine-doped SnO2 glass (Hartford, sheet 
resistance of10 Ω/sq) to form a TiO2 film of 
0.25 cm2. The thickness of TiO2 film was 
controlled at ca. 6 μm. The film was dried in 
 4 
then quickly immersed in a 0.3 mM 
acetonitrile solution containing a TPAR dye. 
This TPAR monolayer was subjected to 
electro-polymerization using cyclic 
voltammetry in 1 N HCLO4 aqueous solution. 
Fig. 4(a) shows the cyclic voltammograms 
(CVs) for TPAR-adsorbed TiO2 mesoporous 
electrode between -200 and 1200 mV, 
revealing one major redox pair in the range of 
750-950 mV. The anodic peak corresponds to 
the respective oxidation of amine groups with 
one electron removal from the nitrogen atom 
at TPAR structure in each repeating unit to 
yield one delocalized radical cation, TPAR+‧. 
The TPAR repeating unit shows its resonance 
structures as Scheme 1. The active sites on 
TPAR resonance structures are strongly 
coupled each other by the consecutive CV 
sweep, resulting in chain extension. Also note 
that the peak positions of the redox couples 
shift gradually to lower potentials in later 
cycles. This shift is attributed to the presence 
of oligomeric species in the bulk film. The 
oligomeric species are further polymerized to 
form a network-like structure of polymer dye 
in later sweeps as shown in Scheme 1. With 
various increments of the positive peak 
current at the redox couples during 
polymerization, the fraction of polymer 
formation on the TiO2 electrode was 
determined by using the measurement of 
positive peak current.17 Thus, the rate of 
polymer formation is directly proportional to 
the increase of current. Anodic peak currents 
were measured from CVs as a function of 
cycle number (i.e., the reaction time) shown 
in Fig. 4(b). It is obvious that the amount of 
polymer formation increases with increasing 
cycle number. Also note that the 
saturation-curve behavior presents in the 
electro-polymerization of TPAR film. This 
indicates that the polymerization rate at the 
early stage is significantly higher than that at 
the later stage. After 20 sweeping cycles, the 
anodic peak current would not further 
increase, indicating that the 
electro-polymerization was completed for the 
anchored TPAR dye monolayer. On the other 
hand, the hydrogen ion was generated in the 
process of TPAR electropolymerization 
(referring to Scheme 1), which can be 
reduced into hydrogen, 2 H+ + 2 e- → H2, 
corresponding to a reduction peak at ca. –50 ~ 
-80 mV in Fig. 4(a). 
Fig. 5(a) shows the absorption spectra of 
as-synthesized TPAR dye in ethanol, TPAR 
and PTPAR dyes adsorbed on TiO2 electrodes. 
The absorption spectrum of TPAR in ethanol 
displays two distinct absorption bands at 
around 300 and 455 nm, respectively. The 
weak absorption peaks at around 300 nm 
correspond to the Π→Π* electron transition; 
strong absorption peaks at around 455 nm can 
be assigned to an intramolecular charge 
transfer between the TPA-based donor and 
the rhodanine-3-acetic acid, providing the 
efficient charge-separation excited state. 
When the dye adsorbed on the TiO2 surface, 
the absorption spectrum of TPAR was 
red-shifted from 455 nm to 500 nm and 
broadened, implying that most of TPAR 
adsorbed on the TiO2 surface in the 
monomeric state with only partially J-type 
aggregates. The absorption spectrum of the 
adsorbed PTPAR dye on the TiO2 surface 
exhibits an obvious blue shift in comparison 
with that of TPAR dye. This is because the 
Π-conjugation systems in PTPAR dye was 
expanded by chain extension between 
adjacent phenyl rings on TPAR forming Π
-bridge. Based on the Tauc relation,19 the 
energy gap (Eg) can be obtained by plotting 
(αhν)2 vs. hν and extrapolating the linear 
portion of (αhν)2 to zero as shown in Fig. 
5(b). The inductive blue shift of PTPAR dye 
can be evidenced by the higher energy band 
gap as compared TPAR dye. The higher Eg of 
PTPAR can be explained by that the electron 
on the TPAR monomer dye is easier to 
remove as compared with that of PTPAR 
polymer dye, because PTPAR polymers have 
the network long conjugation resulting in the 
electron delocalization on polymer chains. 
The electrons on polymer chains could be 
stabilized by the conjugation, leading to a 
higher energy band-gap.  
Cyclic voltammogram (CV) is a 
preliminary characterization technique to 
determine the redox properties of organic and
