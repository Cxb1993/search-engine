elevated temperatures. In this report, an 
InAlAs/InGaAs/InAlAs HEMT was grown 
metamorphically on a GaAs substrate. The 
performance of the MHEMT, including dc, 
microwave, noise, and large signal power 
characteristics is considered. The dc performance 
at elevated temperatures is also examined. 
三、 研究方法及成果 
The studied device was grown on a 
(100)-oriented semi-insulating GaAs substrate by 
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The structure 
begins with InXAl1-XAs metamorphic buffer layers. 
The indium content in the metamorphic buffer 
varies linearly from 0 to 0.475. The thickness of 
the metamorphic buffer layer was 0.5 μm. On this, 
a 0.15-μm-thick In0.45Al0.55As barrier/buffer layer 
was grown (in the inverse step). The active device 
structure from the bottom to top orderly comprised 
a 200 Å-thick undoped In0.5Ga0.5As channel, a 40 
Å-thick undoped In0.45Al0.55As undoped spacer, an 
Si delta-doping of 4x1012 cm-2, a 250 Å-thick 
undoped In0.45Al0.55As Schottky layer, and finally 
a 200 Å -thick heavily doped In0.5Ga0.5As 
(ND=1x1019 cm-3) cap layer to facilitate ohmic 
contact formation. 
The MHEMT was fabricated in the followings 
sequence. First, mesa was performed down to the 
metamorphic buffer layer to provide isolated 
active areas; then ohmic contacts were formed by 
conventional photolithography, thermal 
evaporation of AuGeNi/Au layers, lift-off and 
rapid thermal annealing technique. The gate recess 
was then conducted by etching the n+-In0.5Ga0.5As 
cap layer. Finally, the gate was formed from 
Ti/Au using lift-off. The device geometry was 
2x100x1 μm2 with a source-drain separation of 7 
μm.

Figure 1 plots the common-source 
current-voltage characteristics of the MHEMT at 
300 K. The transistor can be completely pinched 
off. The MHEMT exhibits a peak extrinsic 
transconductance (gm,peak) of 258 mS/mm and a 
saturation drain current density (ID,max) of 471 
mA/mm at VGS=0.5 V. The two-terminal forward 
turn-on and reverse breakdown voltages are as 
high as 1 V and 15 V, respectively. The high 
turn-on voltage and reverse breakdown voltage are 
associated with the high-resistivity and large 
bandgap of the undoped In0.45Al0.55As Schottky 
layer and the large conduction-band discontinuity 
(ΔEC) offered by the In0.45Al0.55As/In0.5Ga0.5As 
heterojunction. 
Figure 2 plots the dependence of extrinsic 
transconductance (gm) and drain current density on 
gate-source voltage at various temperatures. The

BVDS
 
 
 
The drain-source off-state breakdown voltage 
VBDS was measured with the MHEMT using the 
drain-current injection approach, which is a 
relatively simple and safe. Figure 6 displays the 
drain-current injection scan of the MHEMT at 
ambient temperatures: 300 K (solid line), 390 K 
(dashed line), and 480 K (dotted line). The peak in 
the VDS is defined as the drain-source breakdown 
voltage VBDS. For instance, the VBDS value at 300 
K is labeled by a full circle in Fig. 13. The VBDS 
values are around 14.23 V, 13.14 V and 11.94 V 
at 300 K, 390 K and 480 K, respectively. Figure 
14 plots the dependence of VBDS of the MHEMT 
on temperature. The VBDS decline is observed to 
degrade as the temperature increases (so the 
temperature coefficient is negative). The VBDS is 
degraded by only 16% from 400 K to 480 K. The 
right Y-axis of Fig. 13 represents the 
corresponding VGS values, associated with the 
onset of VBDS. Notably, at under 390 K, the onset 
of VBDS moves to the more positive VGS as the 
temperature is increased. Then the onset points of 
VBDS are fixed at the same VGS value of -2.08 V at 
390 K, 420 K and 450 K. In contrast with the 
tendency over the 300 K to 390 K temperature 
range, the onset points of VBDS drop rapidly to the 
more negative VGS as the temperature rises above 
450 K. The variation with temperature over 450 K 
is attributable to the increase in substrate leakage 
current with temperature, increasing the source 
current. Consequently, a more negative gate 
voltage is required to deplete the channel. 
四、 結論與討論 
This report presented a metamorphic high 
electron mobility transistor with an In0.5Ga0.5As 
channel grown by MBE on a GaAs substrate using 
an InAlAs buffer layer. The 1 μm gate length 
MHEMT has a saturation current of 471 mA/mm 
at a gate bias of 0.5 V and a peak extrinsic 
transconductance of 258 mS/mm at 300 K. The 
drain-source off-state breakdown voltage obtained, 
using the drain injection current technique, is 
estimated to be 14.23 V at 300 K. The device 
yields an fT of 35.2 GHz and an fmax of 48 GHz. 
The large-signal power performance of this device 
was tested at 2.4 GHz. The MHEMT has a linear 
power gain of 16.7 dB, a saturated output power 
of 14.7 dBm and a peak efficiency of 40.9%. The 
minimum noise of 1.1 dB with an associated gain 
of 18.3 dB is measured at 2.4 GHz. Additionally, 
the dc performance of the MHEMT was also 
measured as a function of operating temperature 
from 300 K up to 480 K. The temperature 
dependence of Vth of the presented MHEMT is 
very weak. The remarkable performance is 
indicative of the high quality of the epitaxial 
layers of the MHEMT. Moreover, these desirable 
features favor microwave and high-temperature 
applications.
