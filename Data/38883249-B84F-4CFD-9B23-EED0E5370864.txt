study the distribution of response time of a request, 
which is defined as the time needed to fulfill the 
request.  By modeling the system as a queueing 
network, we utilize the phase-type distribution 
approximation to approximate the distribution of the 
response time, on which the on-time-delivery rate can 
further be estimated. Based on framework, we can 
further determine the base-stock levels for each 
stock level in order to satisfy the required on-time-
deliver rate. From the numerical test results, our 
phase-type approximations are promising.  
  How to determine the stock levels is always an 
important issue in the supply chain management. Our 
phase-type approximation provide not only a useful 
insight to the management in evaluating or designing 
the corresponding supply chain but also a tool to 
determine the base stock levels for either the owner 
of the main production line or the suppliers. 
Actually, we can coordinately determine all the base 
stock levels.

中文摘要 
我們考慮一精實生產系統(lean production)，主生產線為一串聯拉式(pull:接到訂單後才生產)生產線，
其中每站會存有少量基本庫存(base stock)。每站的加工須要前站的在製品與外部供應商供應的零件。
供應商的生產方式也是拉式生產。所以主生產線與供應商生產線在各站構成分枝結合(fork join)的結構。
在每站中共有兩個庫存與三個等候線:完成品庫存、零件的庫存、要求完成品的需求、要求生產的工單
以及拿到零件等待加工的工單。精實生產系統強調如期交貨，在達成準時交貨前如何估計訂單的回應
時間(response time:收到訂單到交貨的時間)是一個基本與重要的工作。在本計劃中，我們將以等候線網
路分析精實生產系統並以此求得回應時間的機率分佈。   
在本計劃中我們考慮的等候線網路的特性有三: 拉式/基本庫存、分枝結合與階段服務時間。由於
該等候線網路的複雜性，我們將等候線網路分割為階段加以討論並更進一步以階段性分佈的方式求得
回應時間的機率分佈。決定階段性分佈我們需要求得轉換率(transition rate)矩陣與相對的初始條件
(initial condition)。 
要準備多少庫存一直是業界常要考慮的重要議題。 本計畫的階段性分佈等候線網路模式可計算在
網路中再製品與成品的數目以及回應時間的分佈。經由數值範例的結果，我們的估計有很高的準確性。
此模式將提供管理者評估供應鏈重要的工具，進而可協同決定供應商與主生產線的基本庫存水準。

一、 報告內容 
 
1. Introduction (前言、研究目的) 
    In a lean system, we start to produce a product only when we receive a request; we prepare minimum 
level or zero  inventory and we manage to achieve on-time delivery. Motivated by observing the real system 
such as car assembly, we consider a system in which the main production line is a pull BTO production 
system that starts to produce a product only when it received the request.  To accelerate the delivery, at each 
station some inventories of finished  product or semi-products, called base stocks, will be prepared and the 
production is controlled by base-stock control policy. Under the base-stock control policy, an arriving request 
will take a finished-product from inventory or wait for one when there are none in inventory. In either case, a 
production order(PO) for producing a new product will be released to this station upon the arrival of this 
request. To distinguish the time needed to fulfill a request and the time needed to fulfill the PO released by 
this request, we define the response time be the time needed to fulfill a request and lead time be the time to 
fulfill PO. The response time is zero when an arriving request finds a finished product in inventory, however, 
the lead time must consist of the processing time. 
    The released PO will first acquire a finished semi-product from the precedent station and it then becomes 
a request to the precedent station. However, in order to have a finished semi-product, the request at the 
precedent station will also release a PO to this precedent station and this PO will then become a request to the 
next precedent station. Therefore, when a request arrives to this main production line, POs will be released to 
each station simultaneously. Aside the main production line, there is a supplier provides parts to each station.  
Suppliers of parts also utilize pull production with base-stock control policy. A PO at a station initiating the 
production of a new finished product/semi-product from this station will first wait for a finished semi-product 
delivered from the precedent station, then wait for the part delivered from the supplier of this station and then 
wait for the processing at this station.  
   
    Usually there is a requirement on the response time. For example, when a request for custom laptop 
computer arrives, it will be required that the laptop computer has to be shipped in 20 hours from the assembler.  
The percentage of requests whose response times are less than the requirement is called the on-time-delivery 
rate(OTD rate) which is equivalent to the probability that the response time of a request is less than the 
requirement. In this paper, we model the lean system as a queueing network. By considering the sojourn at 
each station as a phase, we then estimate the distribution of response time of a request by using phase-type 
distribution approximation. Phase-type distribution was first mentioned in [1] and made use in analyzing 
queueing system by [2]. It turns out to be a good approach to analyze tandem queues with inventory.  
 
(文獻探討) 
    While there has not been much research done on studying the distribution of the response time of such 
lean production system, a substantial amount of research has gone into studying some the tandem system 
under base-stock control policy. However, it is impossible to estimate exactly distribution of the response time 
even form the simple tandem queues with base stocks. Two most notable papers in studying the tandem 
queues with base-stocks are [3] and [4]. [3] developed a recursive relations based on sample path analysis to 
approximate the waiting time in system by assuming each station is an M/M/1 queue. [4] used phase-type 
 6 
 
Figure 2  Queues and inventories corresponding to single station 
 
    The detail operations are as follows. An outside request arrives to station J for a finished product. If 
there are finished products in the inventory queue of station J, this request is fulfilled with one finished 
product, otherwise it will wait in the backordered queue(BJ) for the next available finished product on the 
FCFS basis. When every request arrives to station J, a PO will be released to station J to produce a new 
finished product. However, this PO has to acquire a finished semi-product from station  J − 1 by sending 
another PO to station J − 1. The latter PO will join BJ−1 become a request to station J − 1 waiting for a 
finished station-( J − 1) semi-product. The finished station-( J − 1) semi-product then joins the queue NJ 
waiting for a part delivered from supplier-J. The semi-product with part then join WJ  ready for the process 
at station J. When an arriving request arrives to  BJ, if there are finished products in Ij then its response time 
is zero. However, the lead time of the PO released by this request has to wait for a finished station-( J − 1) 
semi-product, then a part and the processing at station J . That is, this PO and corresponding semi-product 
must go from BJ−1, NJ, WJ and the service at station J, while the request only need to go from BJ. Note that 
a semi-product join queue NJ will acquire a finished part from Pj or it will wait in Nj, therefore Njworks as 
the backorder queue for branch j. As in the main production, when a semi-product join queue NJ it will send a 
PO to branch line j to produce a new part.   
    The above mentioned operations and the definitions of response time and lead time also work for all the 
stations in the network.  We adopt the same notations to denote the queues in branch lines. For branch j, we 
denote the queues corresponding to statin i as Ij,i, Nj,i, Wj,i , Bj,i and   Sj,i. Suppose there are Jj stations in 
branch j, Ij,Jj is the inventory of the finished parts and  Bj,Jj is the backorders of the finished parts, however, 
in our system Pj  is Ij,Jj and Nj  is Bj,Jj . 
We can regard these sojourns at stations of semi-product or parts as phases. Therefore, the response time of 
a request and the lead time of a PO will be the sum of the sojourn times in the subsequent phases after where 
the corresponding semi-product is in the network. This is why the phase-type distribution fit in our analysis. 
For phase-type distribution, we define continuous phase-type distribution by  CPH(α, Q)  with initial 
probability α and discrete phase-type distribution by CPH(π, P) with initial probability π . If random 
variable X is of  CPH(α, Q) then 
.                               Pr(X > t) = αeQt                                       (1) 
If Y is of DPH(π, P), then 
                               Pr(Y > k) = πPk ∙ e,                                    (2)                                                             
where e is a column of 1s. The main topics in defining the phase-type distribution are to identify the

where Ej is  
�(µj − 𝜆) �γj+1,Jj+1  Pj+1,Jj+1Sj+1,Jj+1� , (µj − 𝜆) �1 − γj+1,Jj+1Pj+1,Jj+1Sj+1,Jj+1e��.                      (8)    Cj is the transition rate matrix describing the sojourn time starting from the first station to station j in main 
production line. After processing at station j, the finished station-j semi-product will wait for a station-(j+1) 
part.  Ej is the row of transition rates from station-j to the phases where  the station-j part is. The 
corresponding part may be already in inventory Pj+1 or at one of the stations in the branch j+1.  If the part 
is already in Pj+1 , then this semi-product will enter the phase of processing at station j+1 immediately.  
�γj+1,Jj+1  Pj+1,Jj+1Sj+1,Jj+1� is the vector of probabilities of phases where the corresponding part is in branch j+1 and 
�1 − γj+1,Jj+1Pj+1,Jj+1Sj+1,Jj+1e� is the probability that this part is already in Pj+1. Then Lj is of

And it is know that  Rj  is of                                CPH �γjPjSj , Cj�,                                                                       (10) 
where  Pj = λ(λI − Cj)−1 and

As the explanation on (8), when a PO arrives in station 1, γ1,J1P1,J1S1,J1  is the vector of probabilities of phases 
where the corresponding part is in branch 1 and �1 − γj,J1  P1,J1S1,J1e� is the probability that this part is already 
in P1. γJ can be obtained recursively by 
                                    
γi+1 = �γiPiSi , �1 − γi PiSie� �γ𝑖+1,Ji+1Pi+1,Ji+1Si+1,Ji+1 , �1 − γi+1,Ji+1 , Pi+1,Ji+1Si+1,Ji+1e���.                       (12) 
 
In (12),  γiPiSi is the vector of probabilities of the phases where the corresponding semi-product or part is.  �1 − γi PiSie� is the probability that the corresponding semi-product is already in the inventory of station 
i. γ𝑖+1,Ji+1Pi+1,Ji+1Si+1,Ji+1   is the vector of probabilities of phases where the corresponding part is in branch j+1 and 
�1 − γj+1,Jj+1Pj+1,Jj+1Sj+1,Jj+1e� is the probability that this part is already in Pj+1. Therefore, 
�1 − γi PiSie� �γ𝑖+1,Ji+1Pi+1,Ji+1Si+1,Ji+1 , �1 − γi+1,Ji+1 , Pi+1,Ji+1Si+1,Ji+1e�� is the vector of probabilities the locations of part 
provided that semi-product is in inventory waiting for the part.

The response time 𝑅2  is of CPH(γ2P2S2 , C2) and the OTD rate can be approximated by  P(𝑅2 < 𝑡) = 1 − γ2P2S2 ��I-C2 𝑡𝑛�−1�𝑛 , for a large 𝑛 
Based on this system, we test our approximations. First, we consider an extreme case in which we let the 
base stock levels of inventories of both parts be high and the service rate at the first station be fast. In this 
case, the response time will be just the waiting time in system of an M/M/1 queue observed at the second 
station. Let the time requirement for the response time be 2. The data is shown in the first two rows in Table 1. 
Our OTD rates of phase-type approximation are very close to the waiting time in system of a M/M/1 queue. 
Another extreme case is to let all the base stocks be zeros. In this case, when a request arrives the system, 
then the system will make the corresponding finished product from the very beginning. Therefore, the 
response time is simply the waiting time in system of a tandem queue of the following 5 stations in sequence: 
station 1 of branch 1, station 1, station 1 of branch 2, station 2 of branch 2 and station 2. Based on our 
approximation, the OTD rate are also very close to the values from theoretical approximations.  The results 
are shown in Table 1.

We then test our approximations with those obtained from simulations. In Table 2, we vary the base stock 
levels, S11 and S22; in Table 3, we change service rate at station 2(µ2)  to 3 and vary the base stock levels, S11 and S22; in Table 4,  we vary µ1; in Table 5, we vary µ2. The results of approximation are also very 
close to those obtained from simulations.

In Table 6, we consider a case with µ2 = 2.1. The OTD rates are staying low when we try different base

increase the base stock levels in the main production line. Based on our approximations, we  then  can 
have our OTD rate over 90% when S1 = S2 = 50 .

4. Conclusion 
    We consider a lean supply-chain system and study the distribution of response time of a demand by 
considering the system as a queueing network. By properly define the initial probability and the transition 
matrix, we are able to approximate the response time in such queueing network by applying phase-type 
distribution approximation, from which on-time-delivery rate can further be estimated. Our estimations can 
provide a useful insight to the management in evaluating or designing the corresponding supply chain.

一、參加會議經過 
筆者於 6月 28日搭早上班機於中午抵達會場， 傍晚參加接待晚會。 筆者於 6月 30日下午發表
論文。 6月 31日中午搭機返回台灣 
 
二、與會心得 
此次會議是由國際工業工程學會與新加坡大學共同舉辦。到達大會的感覺很像台灣的研討會，工作
人員都是由學生所組成，但當然他們的英文非常流利。 
本國際會議屬中型會議，共有 120篇論文發表。發表人大多來自亞洲各個國家，主要仍是除了中國
大陸之外的華人地區:台灣、新加坡以及香港。論文方面很明顯的是以應用導向為主。大會總共有 3位
Keynote Speakers。第一位是來自美國 Georgia Tech的 Professor JianJun Shi，演講題目為"Data Fusion for 
In-Process Quality Improvement of Complex Systems"。此篇是由輔導美國大型企業(汽車製造商)所產生
的研究成果，其中並有真正需要學術界的 non-trivial數理基礎。Dr. Shi的演講對我收穫很大，與筆者
的研究屬性類似。第二位是新加坡大學的客座教授 Dr. Richard de Neufville演講題目為"Flexibility in 
Engineering Design"。雖然演講人演講生動活潑， 但大部分的內容都是一般我們所知道的 common sense. 
有點失望。第三位是由 IIE 學會主席 Gregory H. Watson，演講題目為"The Challenge of Harmonization in 
Industrial Engineering Education"。演講者有多年在日本工作的經驗，雖然是如此，演講的內容似乎仍與
實際我們亞洲人所認知的有點差別，更何況亞洲每個國家的產業發展也有所不同，例如日本產業的大
型化與著重研發；韓國的品牌與製造研發並重；台灣的製造與研發並重；香港與新加坡的服務業以及
中國大陸的世界工廠所著重的工業工程訓練也會有所不同。 
筆者每個時段皆注意聆聽報告，但收穫有限。與同是亞洲在其他會議的日本與韓國學者的報告的學
術性還是有落差。也許是應用導向的關係，也許很多都是學生報告有關。教授不帶上台報告的情形與
台灣有點類似。除此之外，此行的另一收穫是認識許多新加坡大學的學者。   
 在本次研討會，每一個 section的聽眾當地學生是大多數。本人的論文排在 Supply Chain 
Management II 的 section中。相對於這次研討會的其他的論文，作業研究數理成份較高。

Reviewer 2 
Comments In this work, a supply-chain system is modeled as a queueing network. However, from the 
submitted abstract, I cannot see how to approximate a response time using a phase-type 
random variable. In a queueing system, response times are not primitive quantities. The 
distribution of response times must be analyzed either from data or from the system's 
dynamics. The abstract does not give me any clue about how to analyze the response times 
to derive reasonable approximations. Hence, I feel that I cannot judge the quality of this 
work by the submitted abstract.

either case, a production order for producing a new product will be released to this station upon the arrival of 
this request. The production order will acquire a finished semi-product from the precedent station and it 
becomes the request to the precedent station. However, this request will also release a production order to this 
precedent station and this production order will be a request to the next precedent station. Therefore, when a 
request arrives to this main production line, there is a production order released to each station 
simultaneously.   
In addition to the main production line, there is a supplier provides parts to each station.  Suppliers of parts 
also utilize pull production with base-stock control policy. A production order at each station in the main 
production line will first wait for the finished semi-product from the precedent station, then wait for the part 
delivered from the supplier of this and then wait for the processing at this station.  
The time when a request arrives till this request is satisfied by having a finished product is called the response 
time of this request. Usually there is a requirement on the response time. For example, when a request for 
custom laptop computer arrives, it will be required that the laptop computer has to be shipped in 20 hours.  
This means that the response time has to be less than 20 hours. In this paper, the percentage of requests whose 
response times are less than the requirement is called the on-time-delivery rate(OTDR) which is equivalent to 
the probability that the response time of a request is less than the requirement. To distinguish the time needed 
to fulfill a request and the time needed to fulfill the production order released by this request, we define the 
response time be the time needed to fulfill a request and lead time be the time to fulfill the production order.   
In this paper, we study the distribution of the response time. We model the lean system as a queueing network. 
By considering the sojourn at each station as a phase, we then estimate the distribution of response time of a 
request by using phase-type distribution approximation. Phase-type distribution was first mentioned in [1] and 
made use in analyzing queueing system by [2]. It turns out to be a good approach to analyze tandem queues 
with inventory.  
While there has not been much research done on studying the distribution of the response time of such lean 
production system, a substantial amount of research has gone into studying some the tandem system under 
base-stock control policy. However, it is impossible to estimate exactly distribution of the response time even 
form the simple tandem queues with base stocks. Two most notable papers in studying the tandem queues 
with base-stocks are [3] and [4]. [3] developed a recursive relations based on sample path analysis to 
approximate the waiting time in system by assuming each station is an M/M/1 queue. [4] used phase-type 
distributions approximation mentioned in [2] to approximate the number of customers in system and the 
waiting time in system also by assuming that each station is an M/M/1 queue. Their method provides quite 
accurate estimates of system performance. [5] showed that these two approaches by [3] and [4] are equivalent 
and extended [4] by introducing Coxian 2 service times. [6]  considered the same system as in [4] but with 
feedback customers. [7] extended [4] by adding an end station with hyper-exponential service time that can be 
regarded as a distribution center in a supply-chain network. [8] studied a tandem queue with end 
buffer(inventory) and with no wait customers. They presented the exact analysis for such system and also use 
the phase-type distribution to approximate the steady-state probabilities. It is shown that the results of 
phase-type distribution approximation are close to those from exactly analysis. [9] used decomposition 
method to study the similar system. [9] estimated the probability of the number of the backorders and the 
expected WIPs and further  studied the optimization problem with minimum cost.

time is zero. However, the lead time of the PO released by this request is the time starting from the PO is 
released till a new finished product required by this PO is delivered from station J. This PO must go through BJ−1, NJ, WJ and the service at station J, while the request only need to go through BJ. Note that the above 
mentioned operations and the definitions of response time and lead time also work for all the stations in the 
network.   
As we can see from Figure 1, physically there are stations or “phases” in the network. Logically, the request 
and PO are also facing many “phases” in order to have themselves fulfilled.  An arriving request is facing a 
phase waiting for the finished products or semi-products. The PO released by this request first faces the phase 
waiting a semi-product from the upstream station, then the phase waiting for a part and then the phase waiting 
for processing. This is why the phase-type distribution fit in our analysis.  
For phase-type distribution, we define continuous phase-type distribution by  CPH(α, Q)  with initial 
probability α and discrete phase-type distribution by CPH(π, P) with initial probability π. If random 
variable X  is of CPH(π, P)  then Pr(X > t) = αeQt ; if Y  is of DPH(π, P) , then Pr(Y > k) = πPk ∙ e , 
where e is a column of 1s. The main topics in defining the phase-type distribution are to identify the 
transition matrix and the corresponding initial probability. 
When a request faces the phase waiting for a finished product, the time needed depends on the inventory level 
of the finished product (in Bj). This inventory level seen by the request will be embedded into the initial 
probability of the corresponding phase-type distribution. Similarly, the inventory level of the semi-products in Ij−1 from the upstream station seen by the PO in Bj−1 and the inventory level of the parts in Pj seen by the 
PO in Nj will all be embedded into the initial probability of the corresponding phase-type distributions. 
To avoid the burden on the notations, we also use Bj to denote the number of the backordered requests; Ij 
denote the inventory levels; Nj the number of production orders with semi-product of upstream station; Pj 
the inventory level of finished parts and Wj the numbers of merged orders. We call the supplier to part to 
station j the supplier- j and the corresponding production line the branch j. 
In this paper, we consider a lean production/inventory queueing network in which there are no inventories in 
the main production and there is only inventory of finished parts in the branch line as depicted in Figure 3.

3. Phase-Type approximation on Response Time 
The requests arrive from outside are following a Poisson process with rate λ. Here we consider a more 
general system in which the service time at the station in the main production line is assumed to be of 
phase-type distribution of Mj phases with service rate µjk at the kth phase, k = 1,2, … , Mj. For station j, 
the corresponding branch line j has Jj stations. The service rate of the ith station in the branch line is ωji, i = 1,2, … , Jj. Suppose there are inventories of finished products at the end of the main production line with 
base stock level SJ and there are inventory of parts at the end of branch line(supplier) with base stock Sj,Jj 
for branch line j.  Denote Rj be the response time of a request at station j and Lj be the lead time of the 
PO released by this request. 
Based on our results, the waiting time in system of phase-type service workstation j is denoted by

We consider a lean supply-chain system and study the distribution of response time 
of a demand by considering the system as a queueing network.  By properly define 
the initial probability and the transition matrix, we are able to approximate the 
response time in such queueing network by applying phase-type distribution 
approximation, from which on-time-delivery rate can further be estimated.  
  In academic, our phase-type queueing network approach  has extended the scope 
of the phase-type approximation and set a new format to study the complicated 
queueing network. Based on our approach (the way to define the transition rate 
matrix and initial distributions), we are able to study further general queueing 
network in the future other than fork-join network.  
  In application, our model is application originated and can be applied to the 
real-world system. In this model, we are able to determine the WIP and inventories 
in all the stations and we are able to estimate the waiting time in system, aka, 
the response time, at any station.   
  How to determine the stock levels is always an important issue in the supply 
chain management. Our phase-type approximation provide not only a useful insight 
to the management in evaluating or designing the corresponding supply chain but 
also a tool to determine the base stock levels for either the owner of the main
