Abstract
In this proposal, the mathematical model
of measuring a sample’s topography by using 
an inclined cantilever in the amplitude-
modulation (AM) mode is constructed. This
model can be also applied to the dynamic force
microscopy scanning a sample’s inclined 
topography. The analytical solution of this
system subjected to the nonlinear tip-sample
electrostatic and damping force is derived. The
dynamic behaviors of higher modes of a
non-uniform probe can be determined easily
and precisely by the proposed method. The
comparison of the frequency modulation (FM)
and AM-modes of measuring a sample’s 
topography is made. It has been found that in
the FM-mode an incorrect compensated d.c.
voltage will results in the error of measuring
topography. But it is discovered that in the
AM-mode the measurement error due to an
incorrect compensated d.c. voltage is small.
However, the larger the inclined angle is, the
larger the measurement error. Finally, the
minimization of the measurement error is made.

1. Introduction
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is now
widely used for imaging the surfaces of
materials from the micrometer to the nanometer
scale. Atomic force microscopy in the
frequency-modulation (FM) and
amplitude-modulation (AM) modes have been
developed as a powerful tool for obtaining
atomic-scale images and also information about
tip-surface interactions [ Garci a and Pe rez ,
2002; Giessibl, 2003]. When a.c. and d.c.
biased voltages are applied to a conventional
AFM, Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM)
is obtained. It is a powerful measuring
technique on a nano- meter scale using atomic
force microscopy with an electrostatic force. It
is currently used to image the protein [Rossell

excitated at the root. Two boundary conditions

where A0 and ex are the amplitude and the
frequency of excitation, respectively. is the
inclined angle of the cantilever. Conventionally,
it is often considered that the tip-sample
interacting force is perpendicular to the
cantilever. However, because the cantilever is
usually set up not parallel to the sample’s 
surface [Lin et al., 2006], the lateral force
acting on the tip will occurs. This lateral force
induces a moment applied to the end of the
cantilever, as shown in Figure 1a. This moment
equilibrium at the end of cantilever is expressed
as

where Fts is the interacting force and L is the

where the right-handed term is the transverse
force resulting from the tip-surface interaction
to the beam. ct is the interacting viscous
coefficient. mt is the tip mass. The interacting
force Fts is composed of the background force
and the electrostatic force as follows:

where Fbg represents any non-voltage-

for example, the van der Waals force. The van

potential difference Vcpd on a sample, an

superimposed on the tip-sample voltage Vdc.

8inclined angle , the d.c. biased voltage Vdc on
the root amplitude A0 and the phase angle of
the first vibration mode. It is observed that if 
= 0, increasing the d.c. biased voltage Vdc
increases the tip-sample attractive force and
decreases slightly the resonant frequency.
However, if= 20°, the effect of the d.c. biased
voltage Vdc on {A0,} is significant. The phase
angle shift is significant. The reason is that if 
= 20°, there exists a lateral electric force acting
the tip. Because this force induces a significant
end moment against the bending motion of the
cantilever, the resonant frequency is increased.
Figure 3a and 4a show a significant difference
between the A0-f curves due to Vac and Vdc.
Sadewasser et al. (2004) investigated the
influence of uncompensated electrostatic force
on height measurement in FM-AFM. They
found that the measured step height
meaz clearly depended on the d.c. bias voltage.
A correct height measurement was possible
only if two different contact potential values
were known and the optimized compensation
voltage was applied. However, Lin (2007a)
found that even without an optimized
compensation d.c. voltage, increasing the first
frequency shift and decreasing the tip radius
and the half open angle of the tip can increase
the accuracy of measuring a step height. It is
well known that in addition to the FM-AFM,
the AM-AFM is also a very powerful tool.
Figure 5 shows the effects of the FM and AM
methods on the accuracy of measured step
height. It shows the results by Sadewasser et al.
and those determined by the FM analytical and
perturbation methods by Lin (2007a) and the
present AM method. It is observed that the FM
methods by Lin (2007 a) are closer to the
experimental one than that by Sadewasser et al.
(2004). In the FM-mode, the measurement error
depends greatly on the correct compensated d.c.
voltage. However, it is discovered that although
no correct compensation voltage is given, the
step height can be accurately measured by using
the AM-mode. In other words, If = 0,
measuring a sample’s topography by using the
AM-mode is significantly better than that by
using the FM-mode.
Figure 6 shows the errors of measuring the
step height due to several parameters in the
AM-mode. If = 0, although the correct
compensated d.c. voltage is not given, the
measurement error is negligible. If 0 , an
incorrect compensated d.c. voltage results in a
measurement error. However, this error in the
AM-mode is very smaller than that in the
FM-mode. Figures 5 and 6 show a significant
difference between in the AM and FM-modes.
Figure 5 shows that the larger the incorrect
compensated d.c. voltage is, the larger the error
of measuring the step height. However, it is not
true in the AM-mode. Figure 6 also shows that
if 0 , the larger the half open angle of tip,
the larger the error of measuring the step height.
It is the same result in the FM-mode given by
Lin (2007a).5. Conclusion
5. Conclusion
In this study, the analytical method of
amplitude modulation of an AFM inclined
cantilever subjected to the tip-sample
electrostatic and damping forces is proposed.
This method can be applied to measure the
topography of an inclined sample’s surface. The
behaviors of higher modes are easily
investigated. Under constant tip amplitude and
at the resonant frequency the corresponding
root amplitude is the minimum and the phase
angle will change abruptly. In practice, it is
more difficult to measure the minimum root
amplitude than the phase angle. Therefore, in
the FM-mode, it is better to measure the phase
angle than the minimum root amplitude to find
out the resonant frequency. Moreover, the root
force is too small to interpret a sample’s surface
properties. The effects of the tip-sample
damping coefficient and the frequency of
excitation on the Q-factor are significant. But
the effects of other parameters on the Q-factor
are negligible. Therefore, the Q-factor is
suitable for interpreting a sample’s damping
property. Finally, the effects of parameters on
the measurement errors are concluded as
follows,
(1) The influence of the inclined angle on the
resonant frequency shifts is significant. This
fact should be seriously considered in the
FM-mode.
(2) In the FM-mode, the measurement error
depends greatly on the correct compensated
dc voltage. However, it is discovered that if
