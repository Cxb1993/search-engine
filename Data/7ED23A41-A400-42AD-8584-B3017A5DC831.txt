vehicles, assuming that these two vehicles remain their current
moving speeds and directions. In [5], the authors propose the
time-to-avoidance (TTA) metric to complement the use the
TTC in [4]. The TTA metric used in [5] (denoted as TTAori)
is defined as follows.
TTAori = tr +
βv
µg
(1)
where tr denotes the driver reaction time, β is a speed
reduction factor in the range of (0,1], v denotes the current
speed of the vehicle, µ denotes the friction coefficient of tires
on a road surface, and g is the acceleration of gravity.
The TTC and TTA metrics are used in the operation of
our proposed V2I-CWS. Compared with [4], [5], however,
in our proposed V2I-CWS these two metrics are defined
with extra consideration of the acceleration and deceleration
capabilities of vehicles. With the help of such information,
the estimation of the TTC and TTA metrics becomes more
accurate and realistic, thus reducing the number of false
collision alerts for drivers. The details of our refined TTC and
TTA metrics are explained in Section III-A. In [6], [7] the
authors propose an “Intersection Warning System (IWS)” that
uses v2v communications to reduce the possibility of vehicle
collisions at intersections. They also develop a traffic simulator
to evaluate the performances of the proposed IWS.
Another track of the study of collision warning systems
is to improve the accuracy of vehicle location positioning
technologies. In [8], [9], the authors utilize auxiliary devices
such as gyroscopes and bluetooth radios to improve the accu-
racy of GPS-based location positioning systems. Field trials
were conducted to evaluate the performances of the proposed
approach.
Differing from the previous work, in this paper we propose
a collision warning system that employs v2i communications
to avoid vehicle collisions on the roads. To the best of the
authors’ knowledge, our work is the first paper that proposes
a vehicle collision warning system exploiting v2i communica-
tions.
III. SYSTEM OVERVIEW
In this section, we present the details of the proposed V2I-
CWS. We first explain the refined TTC and TTA metrics used
in V2I-CWS in Section III-A and elaborate on its operation
in Section III-B.
A. The Refined TTC and TTA Metrics
The TTC and TTA metrics used in [4], [5] do not consider
the acceleration and deceleration capabilities of vehicles. To
more accurately estimate the potential collision location and
timing for a pair of vehicles, we refine the definitions of these
two metrics as follows. Suppose that vehicle1 is at the location
(x1, y1) with the moving direction θ1 and vehicle2 is at the
location (x2, y2) with the moving direction θ2. We first use
the formulas 2, 3, 4, and 5 to compute the potential collision
position (xcollision, ycollision). The details of the derivation for
formulas 3 and 5 are explained in Appendix.
xcollision = c1, if θ1 or θ2 is equal to 90 or 270. (2)
xcollision =
(y2 − y1)− (x2 tan θ2 − x1 tan θ1)
tan θ1 − tan θ2 , otherwise. (3)
ycollision = c2, if θ1 or θ2 is equal to 0 or 180. (4)
ycollision =
(x2 − x1)− (y2 cot θ2 − y1 cot θ1)
cot θ1 − cot θ2 , otherwise. (5)
where c1 and c2 are constants.
Algorithm 1 The Calculation of TTCacc
1: if the expected collision location (xcollision, ycollision) computed by
equations 3 and 5 has a unique solution then
2: Let t1 is the time required by vehicle1 to reach (xcollision,
ycollision). t2 is the time required by vehicle2 to reach (xcollision,
ycollision). v1 is the current moving speed of vehicle1 and a1 is the
current acceleration of vehicle1. v2 is the current moving speed of
vehicle2 and a2 is the current acceleration of vehicle2.
Let s1 = v1 ∗ t1 + 12a1t21, where s1 is the distance between the
current position of vehicle1 and (xcollision, ycollision). s2 = v2 ∗
t2 +
1
2
a2t21, where s2 is the distance between the current position of
vehicle2 and (xcollision, ycollision).
3: Solve t1 and t2 and then choose reasonable solutions of t1 and t2.
4: if t1 = t2 then
5: TTCacc = t1 = t2
6: end if
7: end if
8: if the expected collision location (xcollision, ycollision) computed by
equations 3 and 5 has infinite solutions then
9: (v1 ∗ Tttc + 12a1(Tttc)2) − (v2 ∗ Tttc + 12a2(Tttc)2) =
the current distance between vehicle1 and vehicle2
10: Solve Tttc and then choose a reasonable solution to be TTCacc
11: end if
12: if the expected collision location (xcollision, ycollision) computed by
equations 3 and 5 has no solution then
13: TTCacc does not exist. This means that vehicle1 and vehicle2 have
no potential collision location.
14: end if
We then use the algorithm 1 to calculate the TTC value
for vehicle1 and vehicle2. This refined TTC (denoted as
TTCacc) considers the current accelerations of vehicle1 and
vehicle2 and thus more accurately estimates the potential
collision location and timing for the vehicles. We also refine
the TTA metric (denoted as TTAacc) with the consideration
of a vehicle’s deceleration capability. The TTAacc is defined
by formula 6.
TTAacc =
the current moving speed of the faster vehicle
the maximum deceleration of the faster vehicle
(6)
B. The Operation of V2I-CWS
In V2I-CWS each vehicle and roadside unit employs an
IEEE 802.11(b) ad-hoc mode radio to communicate with each
other. At each intersection four roadside units are deployed on
top of traffic light towers, which are usually installed on the
four sides of an intersection. The operation of V2I-CWS is
briefly described below.
As shown in Fig. 1, each vehicle periodically broadcasts
its vehicle information message (VIM) with an interval of 0.2

IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section, we evaluate the performances of the pro-
posed V2I-CWS using the NCTUns network simulator [10].
NCTUns is a generic network simulator capable of simu-
lating communication networks and transportation networks.
To study the effects of employing infrastructure nodes, we
also develop a v2v version of the proposed CWS (referred
to as V2V-CWS). The V2I-CWS and V2V-CWS differ only
in whether infrastructure nodes are used. In V2I-CWS, in-
frastructure nodes using an IEEE 802.11(b) ad-hoc mode
interface are used to estimate vehicle collision probabilities
and disseminate warning messages. On the other hand, in V2V-
CWS no infrastructure nodes are employed and all operational
tasks are performed solely by vehicles equipped with an IEEE
802.11(b) ad-hoc mode radio.
We compare the collision avoidance performances of three
road networks. The first one does not employ any collision
warning systems, the second employs the proposed V2I-CWS,
and the final one employs the V2V-CWS. The simulation
topology is shown in Fig. 3. At the beginning of the simulation,
twenty cars are randomly placed at different locations on the
roads. When a vehicle collision occurs, the collided vehicles
are moved to the starting area of the one-way road circled in
Fig. 3. These vehicles then re-enter the road network. With this
arrangement, the number of vehicles moving on the simulated
roads is fixed. This prevents simulation results from being
affected by unstable road traffic.
The presented simulation results in this section are averaged
across five runs, each of which is performed with a different
random number seed. The simulation time is set to 1,800
seconds. We refine the driver model proposed in [6], [11] as
follows (formulas 9, 10, and 11).

where Vlead denotes the moving speed of the preceding
vehicle (referred to as vehiclelead), Dlead denotes the dis-
tance between this vehicle and vehiclelead, D denotes the
desired distance between this vehicle and vehiclelead that this
driver intends to keep, and Dintersection denotes the distance
between this vehicle and the nearest intersection.
Tc denotes the desired time amount within which the
driver intends to achieve the desired safe distance D, and Vc
denotes the resultant speed at which the driver’s car should
move. t denotes the minimum of the time required for this
vehicle moving at the current speed to reach the current
position of vehiclelead and the time required for this vehicle
moving at the current speed to reach the nearest intersection.

The acceleration variable represents the resultant accelera-
tion/deceleration that this driver has to take at this moment to
keep the desired distance D. In this series of simulations, D
is set to 10 meters and Tc is set to 10 seconds, respectively.
Our proposed driver model models a well-behaved driver,
who always tries to keep his or her car at a safe distance
from the preceding vehicle. Using this model can greatly
reduce vehicle collisions resulting from aggressive and im-
pulsive driving behavior. As such, vehicle collisions mainly
result from off-sight scenarios and chain reactions in off-sight
scenarios.
Three performance metrics are used to evaluate the per-
formances of the proposed V2I-CWS. The first is the num-
ber of vehicle collisions (referred to as Numvc). The sec-
ond is the traffic throughput of a road network (referred
to as throughputroad). In our simulation experiments, the
throughputroad metric is defined as the number of vehicles
passing through the intersection shown in Fig. 3. This is
because the used road topology is composed of two road
courses connected by the intersection. As such, the number
of vehicles passing the intersection per time unit on average
equals the aggregate number of vehicles moving on the two
road courses.
This throughputroad metric can be used to evaluate the
number of false vehicle collision alerts issued by a CWS. A
false vehicle collision alert is defined as a collision warning
message that is issued prematurely. For example, a collision
warning message notifying vehicle VA that it is going to
collided with vehicle VB is issued when vehicle VA is moving
at a speed slower than that of vehicle VB . On receiving a
collision warning message, a vehicle should decelerate to avoid
the potential collision. As such, if many false collision alerts
are issued, the movement of vehicles will be slowed down,
resulting in a lower traffic throughput on a road network.
The final metric is the vehicle collision ratio (VCR), which
is defined as the ratio of Numvc to throughputroad. Com-
pared with Numvc, VCR is the collision probability of a road
network normalized by the road network’s traffic throughput.
Thus, it represents the chance of collision for a passing vehicle.
As shown in Table I, the road network using V2I-CWS
on average can reduce the number of vehicle collisions by a
factor of 4.397, as compared with the road network without
employing any vehicle collision warning systems. One sees

of vehicle positioning slightly degrades the performances of
V2I-CWS, V2I-CWS can still operate well if the vehicle
positioning errors can be limited to a value under 10 meters.
Regarding the traffic throughputs of the road networks,
Fig. 7 shows that as the maximum positioning error increases,
the traffic throughput of the road network employing V2I-
CWS decreases minimally. This indicates that as the maximum
vehicle positioning error increases, V2I-CWS becomes less
and less capable of detecting potential collisions. As such, it
issues fewer and fewer true and false alerts (i.e., it degenerates
to the “Without CWS”). The effect of generating fewer true
alerts is reflected in the increased Numvc and VCR, which
are already shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. In contrast, the effect
of generating fewer false alerts is reflected in the almost-
unreduced traffic throughputs, which is shown in Fig. 7.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose a radio-based CWS employing
vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. The simulation re-
sults show that the proposed CWS can effectively reduce
the number of vehicle collisions at an intersection without
degrading the traffic throughput of a road network.

APPENDIX
In this appendix, we explain in detail how formulas 3 and
5 used in Section III-A are derived. Consider the example
case shown in Fig. 8, where cars 1 and 2 are moving along
the directions −→p1 and −→p2, respectively. θ1 denotes the angle
between −→p1 and the reference x axis and θ2 denotes the angle
between −→p2 and the reference x axis. We then use formulas 12
and 13 to represent −→p1 and −→p2, respectively.
y = tan θ1x + b1 (12)
y = tan θ2x + b2 (13)
As such, b1 and b2 can be expressed as formulas 14 and
15 by transposing tan θ1x in formula 12 and tan θ2x in
formula 13 from the right-hand side to the left-hand side.
b1 = y1 − tan θ1x1 (14)
b2 = y2 − tan θ2x2 (15)
By combining formulas 12 and 13 and performing transpo-
sition, we derive formula 16.
x(tan θ1 − tan θ2) = b2 − b1 (16)
We finally use formulas 14 and 15 in substitution for b1 and
b2 in formula 16 and then perform transposition. The resultant
formula is in the form of formula 17, which is equivalent to
the formula 3 used in Section III-A.
x =
(y2 − y1)− (x2 tan θ2 − x1 tan θ1)
tan θ1 − tan θ2 (17)
Similarly, we also can express x in the forms of formulas 18
and 19 by transposing the terms tan θ1 and b1 in formula 12
and the terms tan θ2 and b2 in formula 13 from the right-hand
side to the left-hand side.
x = (y − b1) cot θ1 (18)
x = (y − b2) cot θ2 (19)
By combining formulas 18 and 19, we derive formula 20.
(y − b1) cot θ1 = (y − b2) cot θ2 (20)
Finally, we use formulas 14 and 15 in substitution for b1 and
b2 in formula 20 and then perform transposition to derive
formula 21, which is equivalent to the formula 5 used in
Section III-A.
y =
(x2 − x1)− (y2 cot θ2 − y1 cot θ1)
cot θ1 − cot θ2 (21)
