Abstract  
In this project we extend the analysis on the spinning non-flat disk to the case when both 
the initial and the deformed shapes of the disk are allowed to have axisymmetrical and 
unsymmetrical components. Attention is focused on the effect of the unsymmetrical 
component on the overall deformation and stability of the spinning disk. It is found that 
the unsymmetrical component with one nodal-diameter tends to slightly defer the 
occurrence of the reverse snapping phenomenon. On the other hand, all other 
unsymmetrical components with more than one nodal-diameter tend to reduce 
dramatically the reverse snapping speed. Experiment is conducted on a non-flat brass disk 
containing an axisymmetrical component and an unsymmetrical component with two 
nodal diameters. The experimental measurement confirms the theoretical prediction.

the steady state deformations are also axisymmetrical. Previous experience in shallow 
shell theory [8] indicates that by including unsymmetrical assumed modes in the solution, 
the critical load of an axisymmetrical shell under axisymmetrical loading is dramatically 
reduced compared to the critical load predicted via a purely axisymmetrical theory. In 
other words, the snap-through phenomenon in an axisymmetrical shallow shell is 
inherently unsymmetrical, in spite of the fact that the lateral load is also axisymmetrical. It 
remains to be seen whether this is the case in a spinning axisymmetrical disk.  
In the experiments conducted by Chen and Lin [6], they prepared a series of disks 
with axisymmetrical warpages. However, unwanted circumferential waviness always 
exists in the manufactured specimens. They reported that when the initial shape of the disk 
is close to axisymmetrical, the experimentally observed snapping speed agrees very well 
with the theoretical prediction. On the other hand, when the wavy amplitude on the outer 
rim amounts to about 30% of the mean height, the reverse snapping speed observed in the 
experiment is lower than the theoretical prediction by the order of about 25%. In light of 
these observations, the second question remained to be answered is how the 
unsymmetrical component of the initial shape affects the overall deformation and the 
reverse snapping speed. To answer this question, we need to extend Chen and Lin’s 
axisymmetrical disk to a non-flat disk with a dominant axisymmetrical component and a 
smaller unsymmetrical component. This investigation may find practical application in 
circular saw cutting. In sawmills, a newly installed saw blade is almost perfectly flat. After 
several working hours, however, the saw blade becomes warped and is in need of leveling 
regularly [9]. Before tackling the problem of a spinning warped disk under cutting force, it 
is desirable to first understand how the warped disk deforms when it rotates freely. In 
general the warped saw blade is of unsymmetrical shape. 
 
2. Equations of Motion 
 From the theory explained in [6], it follows that the equations of motion of a 
spinning non-flat disk, in terms of transverse displacement ),,( trw θ  and stress function 
),,( tr θφ  can be written as, 
 6
where ru  and θu  are the radial and tangential displacements of a material point relative to 
the body-fixed coordinate system. 
 We define the displacement field u as 
    0wwu −=        (12) 
The above equations can be non-dimensionalized by introducing the following 
dimensionless quantities,

After substituting Eq. (12) into Eqs. (1) and (2), nondimensionalizing them, and dropping 
the superposed asterisks thereafter for simplicity, we can re-write the equations of motion 
in the dimensionless forms,

The problem now boils down to solving Eqs. (26) and (29) subject to the homogeneous 
version of boundary conditions (16) to (23), i.e., by imposing 02 =Ω  in boundary 
conditions (16)-(23).  
 
3. Discretization 
In order to solve the coupled nonlinear equations (26) and (29), we use the 
Galerkin method by assuming that the displacement u and stress function 2φ  can be 
expanded in terms of assumed modes mnu  and mnφ  as following,

    044 =−∇ mnmnmn φβφ      (33) 
and the same homogeneous boundary conditions as u and 2φ  do. The subscripts “(c)” and 
“(s)” represent cosine and sine modes. Subscripts m and n represent the number of nodal 
circles and nodal diameters, respectively. It is noted that )(cmnu  and )(smnu  are the bending 
vibration mode shapes of a flat disk. On the other hand, )(cmnφ , and )(smnφ  have no specific 
physical meaning. Instead, they are adopted simply as mathematical tools which are 
eigenfunctions of a self-adjoint system. It can be proved mathematically and verified 
numerically that )(cmnu  and )(smnu  form an orthonormal set, while )(cmnφ , and )(smnφ  form 
another orthonormal set. )(cmnu , )(smnu , )(cmnφ , and )(smnφ  can be expressed in the following

solution expansion, the predicted buckling load will be smaller than the one based solely 
on axisymmetrical assumed modes. This phenomenon is more dramatic for shells with 
larger initial height. This discovery helps to partially close the gap between experiment 
and theory. Because the loading mechanism in the current paper is different from the one 
in the classical shell theory [8], it remains to be examined whether the unsymmetrical 
assumed modes will change the reverse snapping speed prediction of an axisymmetrical 
disk.  
Figure 2 shows the disk position at (r=1, θ =0) as a function of the rotation speed 
for an axisymmetrical disk with 0H =5. In all the calculations presented in this paper the 
Poisson ratio is assumed to be 0.3. Two assumed modes with coefficients 00c  and )(01 cc  
are sufficient to produce convergent solutions in this case. In this paper solid and dashed 
lines represent stable and unstable solutions, respectively. We notice that in the case when 
the disk is not rotating, it appears to possess five solutions, as shown in Fig. 2. Table 1 
lists the coordinates mnc  of these five solutions. The positions 
1
0P , 
2
0P , and 
3
0P  are three 
axisymmetrical solutions. The subscript “0” in these positions indicates that the solutions 
contain only the assumed modes with zero nodal-diameter. The superscript denotes the 
sequence number of these solutions from top to bottom in Fig. 2. The positions 10P  and 
3
0P  are stable while 
2
0P  is unstable. If the disk is in position 
1
0P  when Ω =0, it will be 
flattened smoothly as the rotation speed increases. On the other hand, if the disk is in 
position 30P  (under the base plane and stressed) when Ω =0, it will be snapped to position 
1
0P  when the rotation speed reaches a critical value Ω =8.26. 
The three axisymmetrical positions in Fig. 2 are exactly the same as those 
presented in [6]. In other words, the inclusion of the unsymmetrical mode ( )(01 cc ) does not 
affect the axisymmetrical solutions obtained through the purely axisymmetrical theory. 
However, the inclusion of the unsymmetrical mode appears to produce two additional 
solutions 101P  and 
*1
01P . The subscript “01” indicates that these solutions contain mainly the 
assumed modes with zero and one nodal-diameter. Therefore, they are unsymmetrical 
deformations. These unsymmetrical solutions are unstable. By inspecting Table 1, we 
know that these two solutions are physically identical, only 180 degrees apart 
 14
notice that more unsymmetrical solutions appear when the initial height increases. In 
particular, unsymmetrical deformation ( 102P ) with two nodal-diameters starts to show up. 
 
5. Equilibrium Positions of a Spinning Unsymmetrical Disk 
In this section we investigate the deformation and stability of a rotating disk with 
initial shape containing both the axisymmetrical component 0H  and an unsymmetrical 
component iH . Figure 4 shows the disk position at (r=1, θ =0) as a function of the 
rotation speed for a disk with initial height parameters 0H =5 and 1H =3. In Fig. 4 we use 
12 assumed modes in the expansions (30) and (31). In the case when Ω =0, there exist 
seven equilibrium positions. Table 2 lists the coordinates mnc  of these positions. All these 
solutions are both mathematically and physically different. Among them only two are 
stable, they are 101cP  and 
4
01c
P . These two stable positions have similar components as the 
initial shape, i.e., the axisymmetrical mode and the θcos -mode. It is noted that the 
positions 101csP  and 
2
01cs
P  are two different configurations but trace the same locus in Fig. 4. 
If we replace the ordinate of the graph with the disk position at r=1 and 
2
πθ = , we will 
see two separate loci merging as Ω  increases. The subscript “ cs1 ” in the position label 
1
01cs
P  indicates that the solution contains the modes θcos  and θsin . It is noted that the 
inclusion of the unsymmetrical component )(01 cc  in the initial shape destroys the 
dependence of the resulted equations as described in the last section for an axisymmetrical 
disk. Therefore, for a complete solution we need to include both the cosine and sine modes 
in the expansion. However, the inclusion of the sine assumed modes only affects positions 
1
01cs
P  and 201csP , which are unstable and relatively unimportant. Therefore, for practical 
purpose we can use only the cosine modes in the solution to simplify the calculation. This 
simplification is certainly not applicable in the case when the disk initial shape contains 
the sine components.  
Although the inclusion of the unsymmetrical component in the initial shape 
complicates the overall solution with more unsymmetrical solutions, most of them are 
unstable. We focus our attention on the effect of the component 1H  on the mean 
 16
plane will cease to exist. For instance, in the case when 0H =5 and ≥2H 3.33 the initial 
unstressed position will be the only stable solution of the disk.  
 
6. Measurement of Steady State Deflection  
In order to verify the above theoretical predictions, we conduct an experiment on the 
deflection measurement of a rotating disk with unsymmetrical initial shape. The disk is 
made from a brass sheet with thickness 0.4 mm. The Young’s modulus and mass density 
of the material are 103 GPa and 8864 kg/ 3m , respectively. The inner and outer radii of the 
disk are designed to be 3.75 and 15 cm, respectively. The initial shape of the disk is 
designed to approximate the shape  
22000 wHwHw +=       (42) 
The ratio between 0H  and 2H  is designed to be 5:3. We first machine an unsymmetrical 
mold of the desired initial shape on an NC milling machine. The flat brass sheet is bent 
and locked in the mold. The mold together with the bent brass sheet is then put in an oven 
to heat to 250 o C for one hour to relieve the internal stresses. The unsymmetrical disks are 
then polished and mounted on a clamping device with clamping radius 3.75 cm. The 
deformation of the spinning disk can be measured with a non-contact photonic probe. 
 Figure 9 shows the initial shape measurement of the brass disk in the 
circumferential direction on the outer rim when the disk is not rotating. The symbol •  
represents the measured height relative to the clamping plane at various points on the 
outer rim for both the unstressed and stressed positions. For the measured shape of the 
unstressed position, we can use a least square method to determine the initial height 
parameters as 0H =7.3 and 2H =5.3. With these estimated parameters we can then 
calculate the shape of the stressed position on the other side of the base plane. The 
theoretically predicted shapes in the circumferential direction of these two positions are 
plotted as solid lines in Fig. 9. It appears that the theory predicts the mean height of the 
stressed position quite well. However, the measured wavy amplitude of the stressed 
position is larger than the theoretical prediction. For convenient reference, we present the 
 18
state deflection and the reverse snapping speed of the spinning non-flat disk can be 
summarized in the following. 
(1) In the case of an axisymmetrical disk, the inclusion of the unsymmetrical assumed 
modes in the solution expansion will not change the theoretical prediction on the 
stable configurations and the reverse snapping speed obtained with only 
axisymmetrical assumed modes. All the unsymmetrical deformations are unstable. 
Therefore, for the analysis of an axisymmetrical disk, the axisymmetrical theory as 
the one presented in [6] is sufficient.  
(2) When a small unsymmetrical component is added onto the originally axisymmetrical 
initial shape, it tends to affect the mean height variation and the reverse snapping 
speed of the disk. The effect of an unsymmetrical component with one nodal-
diameter is to increase the reverse snapping speed slightly. On the other hand, all the 
unsymmetrical components with more than one nodal-diameter tend to enhance the 
flattening effect due to rotation and to reduce dramatically the reverse snapping 
speed.  
(3) Experiment is conducted on a non-flat brass disk containing an axisymmetrical 
component and a smaller unsymmetrical mode with two nodal-diameters. The 
experimental measurement on the mean deformation and the snapping speed of the 
spinning disk confirms the theoretical predictions.
