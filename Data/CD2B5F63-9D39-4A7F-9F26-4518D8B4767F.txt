英文摘要：An adaptive two-loop power tracking control scheme is proposed for direct 
sequence code-division multiple-access (DS-CDMA) cellular systems in wireless network. The 
scheme includes an outer-loop controller and an inner-loop controller. An adaptive searching 
algorithm is designed for determining an optimal target signal to interference and noise ratio 
(SINR) for each user in the outer-loop. It can achieve the utility optimization through the net 
utility function according to the quality of service (QoS) for the purpose of resource management 
of wireless communication networks. A prediction control is designed to compensate for the 
effect of round-trip time-delay, channel fading, multiple access interference (MAI), and noise in 
the inner-loop. It can achieve target SINR tracking through a desired pole placement. The 
adaptive two-loop power tracking algorithm performs to achieve utility optimization and target 
SINR tracking at the same time. The stability and convergence of the proposed scheme are 
discussed. To confirm the performance of the proposed method, several simulation results are 
given in comparison with other methods. 
 
Key words: adaptive two-loop power tracking control. prediction control. SINR. utility

tracking error. The target SINR tracking performance of the proposed two-loop power tracking 
control system is superior to those of the conventional methods from the simulations. Therefore, 
the proposed two-loop power tracking control scheme is suitable for CDMA cellular radio 
systems with 3G application. 
The main contribution of this paper is that the dynamic change of the other user’s power level is 
considered. The previous design methods using distributed power control scheme are based on 
the consideration that power control loops of the mobiles in a cellular system are decoupled and 
the interference is regarded as an external disturbance to each other. As a matter of fact, all the 
power control loops for the individual users are coupled through the interference. The 
interference from other users changes from time to time. The proposed method can overcome the 
coupled problem effectively because the outer-loop control updates the optimal target SINR 
periodically. However, the round-trip delay is still supposed to be fixed. That means the mobile 
station can not move quickly. Therefore the power control design using the interacting multiple 
model to overcome the time-varying delay is a good topic for future study.
