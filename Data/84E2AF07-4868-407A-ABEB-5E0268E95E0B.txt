identifying the embedded kinematic units, kinematic insight can be exposed, which leads to 
straightforward and promising rules to prevent redundant links. These rules form the basis of a 
by-inspection procedure to determine admissible location of ground, input and output links in a 
geared kinematic chain. As the topological configuration of a mechanism is determined, the 
connecting conditions among kinematic units reveal the kinematic propagating path between input 
and output. Along the path, the global kinematic relation can then be determined by collecting the 
local  gains of each kinematic unit. 
It is believed that the concept of kinematic fractionation is beneficial to the conceptual design of 
geared mechanisms since the designer can have comprehensive awareness of the kinematic insight of 
the mechanism. 
 
1.Introduction 
1.1. Background 
The concept of decomposition has been used widely to simplify and unveil the tangled relations 
among design parameters of complicated design objects. With proper decomposition schemes, a 
design object can be represented by a corresponding modular architecture, which is used in turn as the 
foundation of modular design. 
Modular design is applied extensively to various phases of design activities. At the conceptual 
design stage, the original design object is usually decomposed as a requirement tree [1], and the 
requirement tree can be further transformed into the function tree [1, 2] according to the designer’s 
experience or other well-developed transformation criteria such as the axiomatic design [3].A typical 
relation between the requirement and function tree is shown in Fig. 1.1. Each sub-function in the 
function tree is used as a design module in the conceptual design stage. Consequently, the designer 
can have a lot of flexibility to achieve the design objective by choosing different methods to complete 
the sub-functions in the tree. 
At the detailed design stage, problem decomposition [1] shows great advantage for multi-variable 
and multi-objective optimization, which are often the designer’s major challenges in the design 
procedures. With suitable lumping rules [4-6], design variables can be grouped so that the original 
problem is sectioned into sub-problems [5,6]. Accordingly the optimization can be completed by 
solving the simplified sub-problems independently or by solving the sub-problems in a multi-level 
model [7]. 
At the final stage of the design activity, modular design also shows impressive commercial 
advantage to build adaptable product portfolio [8-10]. With a common product platform, various 
8 
 
modularity and product architecture is ready for the development of expandable product portfolio. 
The concept of problem decomposition involves the decomposition of non-physical properties in 
the design process such as the design requirements and the design constraints. The main purpose of 
problem decomposition is to diminish the complexity of the design activity. By properly grouping the 
non-physical properties, complicated interactions among different design variables can be clarified to 
help find solutions of the design problem. 
The concept of process decomposition relies on the recognition of the dependence between input 
and output of the design objective. The input and output are correlated by a certain kind of “flow”, 
such as information flow or product flow, depending on which kind of design task is concerned. 
According to the flow direction, the design objective can be decomposed into individual events. 
The concept of product decomposition and problem decomposition lead to a hierarchical 
architecture to represent the design objective. On the other hand, the concept of process 
decomposition results in a chain-type model to represent the design objective. With the established 
design architecture, modular design can be completed by determining the corresponding solutions of 
the sub-components in the decomposed architecture. 
Buchsbaum and Freudenstein [15] proposed a design approach for mechanisms by separating the 
functions from the physical structure. According to this approach, the design of mechanisms can be 
carried out in the topological phase. The topological structures of gear mechanisms have been studied 
extensively in the last three decades [16-22]. These developed atlases of admissible topological 
structures of gear mechanisms form the foundation of conceptual design of gear mechanisms. Chen 
and Liu [23] proposed a hierarchical model to represent the composition architecture of articulated 
gear mechanisms. An articulated mechanism is considered a combination of mechanical transmission 
lines, which in turn can be further decomposed into input and transmission units. These units are used 
as design modules. Chen and Shiue [24] clarified the structural characteristics of the input and 
transmission units. According to the determined characteristics, admissible units are identified from 
the atlas of 1 degree-of-freedom (DOF) non-fractionated geared kinematic chains (GKCs) [16]. By 
combining the selected units along the hierarchical architecture, an articulated mechanism can be 
enumerated according to specified structural requirements. Another example for the modular design 
of gear mechanisms in topological phase is the development of compound geared differential 
mechanisms. Chen and Yao [25] showed that a geared differential mechanism is a combination of the 
input component and the main component. The input component is a 1-DOF mechanism which 
contains an input link while the main component is a (n-2)-DOF GKC for an n-port differential 
mechanism. Atlases of admissible input and main components were identified from 1-DOF 
non-fractionated GKCs [16].

prevent redundant links. These rules form the basis of a by-inspection procedure to determine 
admissible assignments of the ground, input and output links in a GKC. Admissible assignments of 
the ground, input and output links of 1-DOF 5 link GKCs are determined as an illustrative example. 
In Chapter 5, a systematic approach to the determination of kinematic relations between input and 
output links in gear mechanisms is presented based on the concept of kinematic fractionation. It is 
shown that the kinematic unit can be viewed as a functional building block of gear mechanisms, and 
the kinematic propagation from input to output can be determined systematically according to the 
interface among kinematic units. Along the propagating paths connecting input and output, the global 
kinematic relation can then be determined by collecting local gains in each KU. It is believed the 
kinematic units in gear mechanisms provide clear kinematic insights into the interactions among 
input and output links. An example on epicyclic-type automatic transmission mechanisms is 
presented to demonstrate the proposed approach. 
In Chapter 6, structural characteristics of geared mechanisms based on the concept of kinematic 
fractionation are explored to obtain the configurations of KUs in geared mechanisms. According to 
the configurations, the propagation paths of motion and their corresponding global gains are 
formulated. The kinematic characteristics of geared mechanisms are revealed and classified. 
In Chapter 7, the kinematic behaviors of one-DOF, single-output geared mechanisms of up to six 
links are analyzed with regards to the configuration of KUs. Classification of the geared 
mechanisms according to the gain types is established. The assignment of ground, input and output 
links of single- and multiple-KU geared mechanisms according to gain types are implemented with 
redundant links. 
The major contribution of this research are: 
1. Clarify the decomposition schemes of gear mechanisms. 
2. The concept of kinematic fractionation is introduced to help determine the modularity of gear 
mechanisms. 
3. Two approaches to perform kinematic fractionation are developed. 
4. A by-inspection approach for the topological analysis of gear mechanisms is developed. 
5. A systematic and efficient approach for the kinematic analysis of gear mechanisms is developed. 
 
2.Decomposition Schemes of Gear Mechanisms 
2.1. Introduction 
  The engineering design procedure of gear mechanisms can be basically regarded as a data 
coordination activity for achieving certain design objectives. However, for a sophisticated design 
12 
 
same function. Process decomposition for gear mechanisms is achieved by kinematic fractionation, 
which separates the basic sub-systems to correlate and transmit kinematic influences between the 
input and output of the mechanism. With these decomposition schemes, an original design can be 
decomposed into sub-systems which are used as design modules. By analyzing and generalizing the 
modular characteristics, alternative modules can be generated and combined to obtain innovative 
designs. 
 
2.2. Graph Representation 
  In the following discussion, graph theory will be introduced to represent the topological structure of 
gear mechanisms. For gear mechanism, links are represented by vertices, gear pairs by heavy edges, 
turning pairs by thin edges, and each thin edge is labeled according to its associated axis location in 
space. Figure 2.1(a) shows a geared differential mechanism (GDM) and Fig. 2.1(b) is the associated 
graph representation. For gear mechanisms, the connection among coaxial vertices can be rearranged 
arbitrarily without changing the kinematic relations [34]. Figure 2.1 (c) shows a rearranged result 
from Fig. 2(b).

Figure 2.3 Structural modules of a GDM 
 
  The topological structure can provide much more insight into a possible structural fractionation in 
the mechanism. As shown in Fig. 2.1(a), it is difficult to distinguish structural modules and interfaces 
in the GDM. Therefore, the physical structure of a GDM can not be represented by a hierarchy as that 
in Fig. 2.2. However, Fig. 2.1(c) shows that vertex 3 can be identified as a cut vertex. The separation 
of the cut vertex increases the number of components of the topological structure. For the GDM in Fig. 
2(c), the graph can be decomposed as shown in Fig. 2.3 by separating vertex 3 and the new graph 
contains two components, one is composed of vertices (1, 2, 3) and the other one is composed of 
vertices (3, 4, 5, 6). 
  Figure 2.3 implies that a GDM can be decomposed into two parts according to the topological 
structure. Chen and Yao [25] proposed a decomposition model of GDMs as shown in Fig. 2.4. The 
characteristic of the sub-systems in the model is explained as follows: 
a. Input component: An input component is a 1-DOF gear mechanism which contains the ground 
link. The component also contains the unique input link and a local output. Both the input and the 
local output are connected to the ground with a thin edge. 
b. Main component: A main component is a 1-DOF gear kinematic chain (GKC) with 3 ports, where 
two of the ports are used as output links and the other port is used as the local input. All ports in the 
main component are coaxial.

By merging the local output of the input component and the local input of the main component, the 
two components are combined into a complete mechanism. The GDM model suggests that structural 
fractionation is also valid for mechanism design. However, each node in the decomposition hierarchy 
no longer represents an assembly of product modules. Instead, each node is used to denote a merging 
of the common link contained in different sub-systems.

describes where the input is located and how the input torque is transmitted to various output joints. 
Note that the number of MTLs is equal to the number of articulated joints of the wrist. It can be 
observed that each gear only appears in one of the columns of the structure matrix and thus each gear 
has one-to-one correspondence to a certain MTL of the mechanism. Therefore, the collection of all 
links associated with the same MTL represents a sub-system which has a unique kinematic function 
in the mechanism. By collecting the associated gears and links on the articulated joints, an MTL can 
be differentiated from the mechanism. The first column of the structure matrix in Eq. (2.1) represents 
a direct-drive MTL which is composed of links 1 and 2. The second column corresponds to a 2-joint 
MTL with gear links 5 and 6, and links 1, 2 and 3 on the articulated joints. Similarly, the third column 
of the structure matrix represents a 3-joint MTL which contains gear links 7 and 8, and links 1, 2, 3 
and 4 on the articulated joints. The left hand side of Fig. 2.6 shows the graph representation of the 
wrist mechanism shown in Fig. 2.5. The topological structure of the wrist is decomposed into MTLs 
as shown in the middle of Fig. 2.6.

Figure 2.6 Decomposition of a geared robot wrist 
 
  The separation of MTLs shows an admissible approach to decompose a mechanism according to 
functionality instead of structural characteristics. From Fig. 2.6, it can be found that each pair of 
MTLs uses the articulated joints as the connecting interface. The motion of an articulated joint is 
influenced simultaneously by associated MTLs. Hence, the combination of MTLs not only simply 
represents the merging of common links but also has a deeper kinematic insight of integration of 
functions. 
  In addition to the separation of MTLs, Chen and Shiue [24] found that an MTL can be further 
decomposed into an input unit and several transmission units by structural fractionation. As shown to 
the right of Fig. 2.6, an MTL has several cut vertices after coaxial rearrangement. By separating these 
cut vertices, an MTL can be decomposed into units. The multilevel decomposition of MTLs and units 
constitutes hierarchical module architecture as shown in Fig. 2.7 [23]. The characteristics of the 
architecture can be summarized as follows: 
1. An m-DOF wrist mechanism can be decomposed into m MTLs.

start with choosing a suitable decomposition scheme. According to the selected scheme, the 
mechanism is decomposed into sub-systems and can be can be represented by a module architecture, 
which is either a hierarchical model for structural fractionation and functional fractionation, or a 
chain-type model for kinematic fractionation. In the module architecture, the composing modules are 
considered separately from the connecting route. The structural and kinematic characteristics of each 
module is then identified and generalized to determine the searching rules for alternative modules. 
Finally, the alternative modules are combined along the original connecting route to obtain the new 
mechanisms.

Example 
  In hierarchical module architecture, a higher-level module remains a virtual concept until 
lower-level sub-systems are assembled. Hence, to find an innovative mechanism based on 
hierarchical architecture is equivalent to find admissible alternative modules at the bottom level of the 
hierarchy. With the determined alternative modules, an innovative mechanism can be synthesized 
backward along the connecting route of the hierarchy which shows the structural dependency among 
modules. 
  Since original connecting route is used to regulate the structural dependency in the mechanism, the 
topological structure of an alternative module should have the same structural characteristics as the 
original module at identical position in the hierarchy. For instance, the module hierarchy in Fig. 2.7 
shows that the bottom-level modules of a wrist mechanism are input and transmission units. Chen and 
Shiue [24] verified the structural characteristics of the units as follows:

constructed an atlas of non-fractionated EGTs with up to three-DOF and four gear pairs. However, in 
the above results, EGTs were regarded as non-fractionated only from the structural point of view 
since no cut link can be identified. The embedded kinematic fractionation inside an EGT was not 
investigated. 
In the design decomposition analysis, the functional dependence table [6] is used to show the 
relation among design variables and to find potential grouping of the objective functions. Kusiak and 
Larson [1] used the constraint-parameter incidence matrix to decompose the constraints in a design 
problem. However, by applying either one of these above methods, it is found that EGTs can be 
decomposed according to the structural constraints only. Hence, a tool for unraveling the embedded 
grouping of kinematic relations is needed. 
In this chapter, the traditional definition of fractionation of gear mechanisms is reviewed and a 
generalized definition of fractionation is introduced by investigating the embedded kinematic 
relations in an EGT. Two approaches to perform kinematic fractionation in introduced in this chapter. 
One of the approaches is developed on the base of the generalized vertex-vertex adjacency matrix. By 
observing the relations among the elements in the matrix, the composition list(s) of an EGT can be 
determined to show the kinematic grouping of the links. Each lumped set of links forms a kinematic 
unit (KU) of a gear mechanism. Another approach to perform kinematic fractionation is developed by 
identifying the displacement graph of the mechanism. The graph-based approach is visually 
advantageous to observe directly the connecting relations between KUs. From the composition list(s) 
or KU(s), the type of fractionation can be determined. It is shown that a structurally non-fractionated 
EGT may be kinematically fractionated while a structurally fractionated EGT must be kinematically 
fractionated. It is found that most 1-DOF up to 6-link and 2-DOF up to 7-link non-fractionated EGTs 
enumerated by Freudenstein [16], Tsai [18], Tsai and Lin [19], and Hsu [21] can be further 
fractionated via the concept of kinematic fractionation. With the concept of kinematic fractionation, 
the KU(s) can be identified and the kinematic interaction inside an EGT are exposed explicitly. 
 
3.2. Structural Fractionation 
  The concept of structural fractionation has been briefly introduced in the previous section. In the 
chapter, a more rigorous definition of structural fractionation is explained by reviewing the following 
definitions: 
a. pseudo-isomorphism 
  The sub-graph of an EGT obtained by deleting all heavy edges forms a tree [16]. In particular, the 
connection of a sub tree composed of vertices having the same label can be rearranged without any 
kinematic deviation [34]. The operation of coaxial rearrangement is called vertex selection. Two

3.3. Basic concepts of kinematic fractionation 
3.3.1. Grouping of fundamental circuits 
Figure 3.2(a) shows EGT 1400-1-4 [16] in which the square vertex represents a carrier. Since no 
articulation point can be found in all its pseudo-isomorphic graphs, the given kinematic chain is 
structurally non-fractionated. Freudenstein [36] introduced the concept of fundamental circuit to 
represent the minimal kinematic structure in a gear mechanism. A fundamental circuit consists of two 
vertices representing a pair of meshing gears, a vertex representing the associated carrier, and the 
connecting edges. For EGT 1400-1-4, the fundamental circuits are (1, 2)(3), (5, 2)(3) and (1, 4)(5) and 
the associated fundamental circuit equations [36] can be written as 
13 21 23θ θ= ⋅e                       (3.1a) 
24 
 
Figure 3.2 EGT 1400-1-4 
 
  By taking vertex selection among links 1, 3 and 5, a pseudo-isomorphic graph can be obtained as 
shown in Fig. 3.2(b). In Fig. 3.2(b), a thin edge between vertices 1 and 5 is formed to replace the thin 
edge between vertices 1 and 3. From Fig. 3.2(b), it can be seen that the angular displacement θ15 is 
influenced by the input angular displacement θ45 through the fundamental circuit (1,4)(5). In turn, θ15 
influences the fundamental circuits (1,2)(3), (5,2)(3) simultaneously since vertices 1 and 5 are at the 
two ends of the heavy-edged path 1–2–5. Hence, the pseudo-isomorphic graph shown in Fig. 3.2(b) 
provides a clearer picture of the connection among the three fundamental circuits. It can be seen that 
the three fundamental circuits are divided into two groups, one is (1,4)(5) and the other is composed 
of (1,2)(3) and (5,2)(3), by using θ15 as the common variable. Corresponding to the common variable, 
vertex 1, vertex 5 and their connecting thin edge are considered a common linkage between the two 
groups. Differentiating from the common linkage results in the fractionation shown in Fig. 3.2(c). In 
Fig. 3.2(c), the upper group consists of the two coupled fundamental circuits (1,2)(3), (5,2)(3), and 
the lower group consists of the fundamental circuit (1,4)(5). 
  In the lower group, the input is transformed into a function of θ15 by Eq. (3.1c) and is transmitted to 
the upper group through the common linkage in between. From Eqs. (3.1a) and (3.1b), the output 
angular displacement θ35 can be written as 
25

The relation between coaxial links 1, 3, and 5 can be expressed as 
13 15 35θ θ θ= −                       (3.3)

(3.5) 
From the above derivation, it can be seen that the group associated with Eq. (3.1c) is used to 
transform the angular displacement of the input link while the group associated with Eqs. (3.1a) and 
(3.1b) is used to generate the angular displacement of the output link. The common linkage between 
the two groups receives the input information and carries into the group containing the output link. 
26 
 
By taking a cut link as a degenerated case of the common linkage, a structurally fractionated EGT 
can be also regarded as kinematically fractionated. In contrast, a kinematically fractionated EGT is 
not necessarily structurally fractionated, such as the 1400-1-4 graph in Fig. 3.2(a). Hence, the concept 
of kinematic fractionation is not only an extension of structural fractionation but actually contains the 
concept of structural fractionation as a sub case. 
 
3.4. Matrix-based Approach to Identify KUs 
According to previous section, it is known that to identify the KUs is to group the gears which have 
that same carrier. By modifying the link adjacency matrix [37], the generalized vertex-vertex 
adjacency matrix is introduced to express the relations in a geared kinematic chain and can be defined 
as: 
[ ]= ijvV                           (3.6) 
where vij = 0 if vertices i and j are neither adjacent nor coaxial, vij = G if vertices i and j form a gear 
pair, vij = axis label if vertex i and j are adjacent or coaxial, and vii = 1. 
Such as the 1400-1-4 graph shown in Fig. 3.2(a), the generalized vertex-vertex adjacency matrix 
can be expressed as

For a given vertex-vertex adjacency matrix, the following properties of the corresponding gear 
train are revealed: 
1. A link can be recognized as the carrier associated with a gear pair if more than two axis labels can 
be found in the corresponding row. 
2. The association of a gear pair to the identified carriers can be determined according to the following 
rule: For Vij = G, link k is the carrier between gears i and j if Vik and Vjk have different axis labels 
since a carrier must carry a pair of gears in different axes. 
  Based on the above properties of vertex-vertex adjacency matrix, a procedure to find the 
kinematically independent group(s) in an EGT is developed as follows: 
Step 1: Establish the generalized vertex-vertex adjacency matrix 
Step 2: Identify the carrier(s) and the associated gear pairs 
  By examining all the G elements in upper triangle of a vertex-vertex adjacency matrix, the carrier(s)

Figure 3.7 KUs of EGT 1400-1-4 
 
Step 3. Obtain KUs by connecting the common vertices in each sub-graph obtained from Step 2 with 
a thin edge. 
In Fig. 3.6, each sub-graph has already a thin edge connecting the common vertices 3 and 4. Hence, 
each connected sub-graph in Fig. 3.6 represents a KU which can be rearranged as shown on the 
right-hand side. On the left-hand side of Fig. 3.7, it can be seen that vertices 1 and 5 are common to 
both connected sub-graphs. One of the sub-graphs has already a thin edge between vertices 1 and 5 
directly while another sub-graph uses a coaxial thin-edged path, 1 - 3 - 5, to connect vertices 1 and 5.. 
Hence, a thin edge can be relocated between vertices 1 and 5 by coaxial rearrangement. The 
rearranged result is shown on the right-hand side of Fig. 3.7 in which each connected sub-graph 
represents a KU. 
 
3.6. Topology of GKCs 
The results from matrix-based approach or graph-based approach can be used to determine the type 
of fractionation of EGTs. 
Type 1:  An EGT is kinematically non-fractionated if only one composition list (KU) is obtained. 
  For instance, Fig. 3.8 shows the graph representation of EGT 2210-4a. The associated generalized 
vertex-vertex adjacency matrix can be expressed as:

                (3.13b) 
  From Eqs. (3.13a) and (3.13b), it can be found that links (1, 2, 3) form a KU and links (3, 4, 5, 6) 
form another KU. The two composition lists have only one common member, link 3, which represents 
the cut link between the two KUs. Hence, the differential mechanism is both structurally and 
kinematically fractionated. 
Type 3: An EGT is structurally non-fractionated but is kinematically fractionated (SNKF) if more 
than one composition lists can be obtained and the number of common members of the composition 
lists is greater than one. 
  For the EGT 1400-1-4 in Fig. 3.5(a), Eqs. (3.9a) and (3.9b) represent the obtained two composition 
lists in which two common members, links 1 and 5, are found. Hence, EGT 1400-1-4 is structurally 
non-fractionated but is kinematically fractionated. 
  Applying above procedure to the existing atlas of 1-DOF structurally non-fractionated EGTs [16, 
18, 19, 21], it can be found that for five-link case, there are originally thirteen non-fractionated EGTs 
and six of them can be further fractionated via the concept of kinematic fractionation. As for the 
six-link case, fifty-four of the eighty-one non-fractionated EGTs are shown to be kinematically 
fractionated. In Figs. 3.9 and 3.10, the geared kinematic chains (GKCs) of the kinematically 
fractionated EGTs are shown respectively according to the number of links. Table 3.1 shows the 
fractionated results of the 1-DOF up to 6-link and 2-DOF up to 7-link structurally non-fractionated 
EGTs. From Table 3.1, it can be seen that all two-DOF structurally non-fractionated EGTs are 
kinematically fractionated. 
 
3.7. Summary 
  The concept of kinematic fractionation has been introduced. The definition of fractionation of 
EGTs is extended by taking kinematic properties into account. A matrix-based approach and a 
graph-based approach are both developed to find the KU(s) embedded in an EGT. It is shown that the 
kinematically fractionated EGTs may be structurally fractionated while the structurally fractionated 
EGTs must be kinematically fractionated.

4.2. Kinematic Dependency in a KU 
The kinematic relation in a fundamental circuit can be described by a fundamental circuit equation. 
In Fig. 4.1, vertices i, i+1 and k form a fundamental circuit and the associated fundamental circuit 
equation can be expressed as 
, 1, 1,θ θ+ +=i k i i i ke                      (4.1) 
 
i i+1
k
i+ni+2 i+n-1
 
 
Figure 4.1 A typical KU 
 
Also, vertices i+1, i+2 and k form another fundamental circuit and the associated fundamental 
circuit equation can be expressed as 
1, 2, 1 2,θ θ+ + + +=i k i i i ke                    (4.2) 
Since gear vertex i+1, and the carrier vertex k are common to both fundamental circuits, Eqs. (4.1) 
and (4.2) have a common variable, θi+1,k. Substituting Eq. (4.2) into Eq. (4.1) yields 
, 2, 1 1, 2,θ θ+ + + += ⋅i k i i i i i ke e                 (4.3) 
Similar substitutions can be repeated along the heavy-edged path. By repeating the substitution of 
fundamental circuit equations, kinematic relation between two ends of the heavy-edged path can be 
described by an augmented fundamental circuit equation. For instance, the relation between links i 
and i+n in Fig. 4.1 can be written as 
, i n , i n-1 1, 2 i 1, i ,e eθ θ+ + + − + − + += ⋅ ⋅Li k i n i n i n ke     (4.4) 
It can be seen that the gear ratios in Eq. (4.4) includes all the gears between link i and i+n, and thus 
it exposes the carrier, the ends and also the transmission path in a KU. Hence, an augmented 
fundamental circuit equation can be used to describe the kinematic constraint among links in the same 
KU. 
The end of each motion transmission path of the entire GKC is referred to as an end vertex. Since 
motion is transmitted along the heavy-edged path, it is obvious that an end vertex should be on the 
open end of the heavy-edged path. As a GKC contains more than one KU, the end of motion 
38 
 
(3)No redundant links. 
 
4.3.1. Mobility Requirements 
  The input link and its supporting link form an actuator pair [41]. From the first requirement, each 
actuator pair should be assigned on a thin edge incident to the ground. Hence, we have 
Axiom 1: The number of thin edges incident to the ground is equal to or greater than the number of 
DOF of the mechanism, F. 
  The relative angular displacement between the actuator pair is used to determine the motion of 
other links. A link is said to be properly constrained if its motion can be determined according to the 
motion of actuator pair(s). With the concept of kinematic fractionation, the motion of a link is lumped 
with other links in the same KU. From Eq. (4.4), it can be seen that once the motion of an actuator pair 
is assigned in a KU, the motion of other links will be determined sequentially along the heavy-edged 
path. As a KU has more than one actuator pair, the KU turns out to be overly constrained. Thus, we 
have 
Axiom 2: A KU can contain at most one actuator pair. 
  With the single input, the motion of each link inside the KU is completely constrained. In addition, 
a mechanism with properly constrained motion should obey the following axiom: 
  
40 
 
Axiom 3: The total number of actuator pairs is equal to the number of DOF of the mechanism, F. 
 
4.3.2. Minimum number of output link(s) 
Based on a GKC, a gear mechanism is developed such that the number of DOF is equal to the 
number of inputs specified in advance. However, the number of outputs is usually not taken into 
account. Hence, the topological structure of the GKC only ensures to provide enough mobility but 
can’t guarantee a proper kinematic structure to perform the specified function. 
  The ground, input and output links are said to be the ports of a mechanism. Let M be the number of 
ports in the mechanism. According to the statement in Axiom 3, M can be resolved as follows based 
on the fact that a mechanism can have only one ground link: 
M = 1+ F + P (4.5)                   
where P is the number of outputs. 
  By viewing each KU as a sub-mechanism of the GKC, a KU should contain at least one of the ports 
to avoid redundancy. Thus, we have: 
Axiom 4: The number of ports in a mechanism is greater than or equal to the number of KUs in the 
associated GKC, i.e. 
  M ≥ K                            (4.6) 
  A link becomes redundant if it has no contribution to transmitting motion from the input link to the 
output link. Since the end vertex represents a terminal of a transmission path, every end vertex in the 
GKC needs to be assigned as one of the ports to avoid forming redundant links. Hence, the concept of 
end vertices leads to the following axiom: 
Axiom 5:  The number of ports in a mechanism is greater than or equal to the number of end vertices 
in the associated GKC, i.e. 
  M ≥ E                            (4.7) 
By substituting Eq. (4.5) into Eqs. (4.6) and (4.7) respectively and since a mechanism should have at 
least one output, the number of outputs in a GKC can be derived as: 
  P ≥ Max. {1, L1, L2}                 (4.8) 
where 
  L1 = K - (1 + F)                    (4.9) 
and 
  L2 = E - (1 + F)                    (4.10) 
42 
 
  According to R1 and R2, it can be seen that every vertex in graph 1400-1-7 is eligible to be the 
ground. 
 
4.4.2. Assignment of the input link 
  In a ground-actuated mechanism, the requirements of admissible locations of input link(s) can be 
derived from Axiom 2 as follows: 
R3: A vertex can be selected as an input if it is adjacent to the ground vertex with a thin edge. 
R4: As more than one input link is required, actuator pairs should be assigned in different KUs. 
  In addition, another requirement for the input can be derived from R2 as follows 
R5: The input vertices are selected such that the number of end vertices, which are not on the actuator 
pair(s), is no more than M - 1 - F. 
  According to R3, R4 and R5, the input link in graph 1400-1-7 can be selected according to different 
selections of ground vertices: 
(1). Vertex 1 is the ground: It can be found that vertex 4 is adjacent to vertex 1 with a thin edge. In 
addition, a thin edge can be formed between vertices 3 and 1 by coaxial rearrangement. Since both of 
the two vertices satisfy R5, two admissible combinations of the ground and input links are obtained 
and can be expressed as [G; I] = [1; 3] and [1; 4]. 
(2). Vertex 2 is the ground: Vertex 4 is the only one vertex that is connected to vertex 2 with a thin 
edge. However, if vertex 4 is assigned as the input link, R5 can’t be satisfied. Thus, no admissible 
results can be obtained by choosing vertex 2 as the ground. 
(3). Vertex 3 is the ground: After coaxial rearrangement, it can be found that vertices 1, 4 and 5 are 
adjacent to vertex 3 with a thin edge. However, only vertices 1 and 5 satisfy R5. Thus, admissible 
combinations of the ground and input links are obtained as [3; 1] and [3; 5]. 
(4). Vertex 4 is the ground: Vertices 1, 2 and 3 are found to be adjacent to vertex 4 with a thin edge. 
However, only vertex 1 satisfies R5. Thus, the only one admissible combination of the ground and 
input links is obtained as [4; 1]. 
(5). Vertex 5 is the ground: The only one vertex connected to vertex 5 with a thin edge is vertex 3, 
which also satisfies R5. Thus, one admissible combination of the ground and input links is obtained 
as [5; 3]. 
 
4.4.3. Assignment of the output link 
  According to the requirement described in Eq. (4.7), admissible locations of output link(s) should 
meet the following requirements: 
R6: Each end vertex, which is not on the actuator pair, is assigned as the output link.

Figure 4.3 1-DOF EGT 6201-2 
 
    As vertex 3 is used as the ground, it can be seen that vertex 1 is connected to vertex 3 with a thin 
edge, and vertex 6 can also have a thin edge to connect vertex 3 after coaxial rearrangement. However, 
from R5, it is known that the number of end vertices, which are not on the actuator pair should be no 
more than M - 1 - F = 2. Thus, only vertex 6 can be assigned to be the input link. 
  With [G; I] = [3; 6], the remaining two end vertices should be used as the output links to prevent 
redundancy. Thus, a set of admissible assignment of the ground, input and output links are obtained as 
[G; I; O] = [3; 6; (4, 5)]. Figure. 4.3(c) shows an admissible functional representation of the 
mechanism in which the rotation of input link 6 makes links 1 and 2 rotate along the fixed axis b, and 
links 4 and 5 orbit about axis b with the same angular velocity but rotates about axis c with different 
angular velocity. 
48 
 
 
  According to Eq. (4.8), the mechanism requires at least one output link. By requesting one output, 
that is M = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4, admissible assignments of the ports can be obtained as follows. 
  From R1, it is known that the ground should be located on a vertex, which is incident with at least 
two thin edges. According to R2, it is known that the ground vertex should be selected such that the 
number of end vertices, which are not assigned as the ground, is no more than M - 1 = 3. R1 and R2 
indicate that the ground vertex can be selected from vertex 2, 4 or 5. The locations of input and output 
links are determined based on different selections of the ground vertex: 
Case 1. Vertex 2 is the ground: The input links can only be placed on vertices 4 and 5, which are 
connected to vertex 2 with a thin edge. However, both vertices are not valid locations for the input 
links according to R5. Thus, no admissible configurations can be obtained by selecting vertex 2 as the 
ground. 
Case 2: Vertex 4 is the ground: Vertices 1, 2, 5 and 6 are connected to vertex 4 with a thin edge. 
According to R4 and R5, only vertices 1 and 6 are valid locations for the inputs. Based on [G; I] = [4; 
(1, 6)], the remaining end vertex, vertex 3, is selected as the output according to R6. Thus, a set of 
admissible combination of the ground, input and output links is obtained as [G; I; O] = [4; (1, 6); 3]. 
Case 3: Vertex 5 is the ground: Vertices 2, 3 and 4 are connected to vertex 5 with a thin edge. However, 
no admissible locations for the inputs can be obtained according to R4 and R5. Thus, no admissible 
configurations can be obtained by selecting vertex 5 as the ground. 
From the above discussion, it is found that only one set of admissible assignment of the ground, input 
and output links can be obtained for graph 4-1-1. Figure. 4.4(c) shows an admissible functional 
representation of the mechanism. 
Through the process of assigning the locations of the ground, input and output links, it can be found 
that the concept of KU and the locations of end vertices provide a designer with clear comprehension 
of possible redundancy. 
 
4.6. One-DOF 6-link gear mechanisms 
  As an extended comparison to the procedures proposed by Olson, et al. [39], the following 
development of one-DOF 6-link gear mechanisms will be confined to those configurations with an 
input and an output adjacent to the fixed link via revolute joints. From Eq. (4.8), it can be inducted 
that both L1 and L2 can’t exceed unity and thus the following conditions can be derived from Eqs. (4.9) 
and (4.10): 
K ≤ 3 (4.15a)

Figure 4.6 EGT 6206-2 
 
  For example, EGT 6206-2 in Fig. 4.6 has two end vertices, and according to r1 and r2, vertices 1, 2 
and 5 can be selected as the ground. As vertex 1 is used as the ground, the ports must be located on 
vertices 2 and 5 according to r3. However, the assignment is invalid as r4 and r5 are taken into 
consideration. With the same reason, vertex 5 is invalid as well. As vertex 2 is selected as the ground, 
a thin-edged path can be formed among vertices 6, 2 and 5 by coaxial rearrangement. By using 
vertices 6 and 5 as the ports, this assignment can fulfill all the topological requirements listed above, 
and thus this is a set of admissible configuration of 1-DOF 6-link gear mechanism as shown in Table 
4.3. 
  As an EGT has more than one end vertex, the topological requirements, r1 to r5, can also be 
applied in reverse order, i.e. determining a thin-edged path connecting the end vertices first and then 
deciding the locations of the ground and ports. For instance, vertices 4 and 6 in EGT 6305-3 are 
recognized as end vertices as shown in Fig 4.7. The thin-edged path 6-2-4 is determined as the only 
one admissible condition to satisfy r5, in which vertex 2 is the unique admissible location for the 
ground. 
4.7. Summary 
The concept of kinematic unit is introduced to determine the basic kinematic structures in a GKC. 
The identified kinematic units and end vertices depict the kinematic insight in the GKC and provide a 
clear guidance to prevent inducing redundant links. A systematic approach for the topological 
analysis of gear mechanisms is developed accordingly. From the approach, admissible assignments of 
the ground, input and output links can be obtained directly by inspection without deriving the 
kinematic relations between input and output links. Admissible assignments for 1-DOF, 5-and 6- link

perspective to determine kinematic modules in a gear mechanism. The kinematic modules in turn 
serves as an efficient tool to determine complicated kinematic relations among input and output links. 
 
5.2. Types of common linkage 
  By applying the graph-based procedure to 2-DOF 6-link EGTs [19], KUs can be obtained as shown 
in Figs. 5.1. 
  From Table 4.1 and Fig. 5.1, totally ten distinct KUs are identified as shown in Table 5.1 in which 
each KU is labeled as Kn−# where n is the number of links and # is the serial number. 
A common linkage is referred to as the interface among KUs and is composed of links and 
connecting thin edges shared by each other. From Table 4.1 and Fig. 5.1, two kinds of common 
linkages can be identified: 
(1). 2-link-chain type: This kind of common linkage exists between two KUs, and the relative 
angular displacement between links on the common linkage is used as the communicating medium 
between KUs. For instance, Fig. 5.2(a) is the graph representation of EGT 1400-1-4 and Fig. 5.2(b) is 
the embedded KUs. As shown in Fig. 5.2(b), KU1 and KU2 share a 2-link chain with vertices 1 and 5 
on it. 
(2). Coaxial-triangle type: This kind of common linkage exists among three KUs in which each 
pair of KUs share a common vertex. As shown on the right hand side of Fig. 5.1, those thin edges 
forming the coaxial triangle are specially marked with short lines.

Both the local input and output in the KU can be expressed as the relative angular displacement 
between a turning pair, which is corresponding to a thin edge in graph representation. According to 
the types of adjacent vertices, thin edges in a KU can be classified into two different types: 
(1) gear-carrier (g-c) type: One end of the thin edge is connected to a gear vertex, and the other end 
is to a carrier vertex. A g-c type thin edge is denoted by a thin line as shown in Table 5.1. 
(2) gear-gear (g-g) type: Both ends of the thin edge are gear vertices. A g-g type thin edge is 
distinguished from the g-c type thin edges by a double line representation. 
Note that a g-g type thin edge in a KU can be formed by coaxial rearrangement as the thin edges 
connecting each of the two gear vertices and the carrier have the same axis label. As a g-g type thin 
edge is added to a KU, one of the coaxial g-c type thin edges should be deleted. 
The KUs which can have g-g type thin edge(s) are collected as shown in Tables 5.2 and 5.3. Each 
KU in Table 5.2 is labeled as Kn-#S which indicates that the KU is originated from Kn-# with single 
g-g type thin edge. Similarly, each KU in Table 5.3 is labeled as Kn-#D which indicates that the KU is 
originated from Kn-# with double g-g type thin edges. Note that one of the coaxial g-c type thin edges 
of KUs in Table 5.2 and two of the coaxial g-c type thin edges of KUs in Table 5.3 can be removed 
arbitrarily. 
Among these thin edges, a KU can have at least one of the following three internal conversions 
modes: 
Case 1. g-c vs. g-c type: The internal conversion is between two g-c type thin edges. Both the local 
input and output of the KU are located on g-c type thin edges. For KUs with up to 5 links,

this internal conversion mode can take place between any two thin edges in Table 5.1. 
Case 2. g-c vs. g-g type: The internal conversion is between a g-c type thin edge and a g-g type thin 
edge. The local input and output of the KU are located on different types of thin edges. For KUs with 
up to 5 links, this internal conversion mode can take place between the g-g type thin edge and any one 
of the g-c type thin edges in Table 5.2. 
Case 3. g-g vs. g-g type: The internal conversion is between two g-g type thin edges. Both the local 
input and output of the KU are located on g-g type thin edges. For KUs with up to 5 links, this internal 
conversion mode can take place between the two g-g type thin edges in Table 5.3 
5.3.2. Local Gain 
The local gain is referred to as the ratio of local output to local input in a KU. According to the 
internal conversion mode, associated local gain can be derived as follows: 
A. g-c vs. g-c type conversion 
  Since there is a unique carrier in each KU in Table 5.1, the kinematic relation between the two ends 
of the heavy-edged path can be derived by combining associated fundamental circuit equations as 
follows: 
, , 1 1, , , ,θ θ θ+ −= =Ly k x x y y x k x y x ke e E  (5.1) 
where θy,k is the relative angular displacement between gear vertex y and the carrier k, x+1 represents 
the vertex on the right hand side of vertex x, y-1 represents the vertex on the left hand side of vertex y, 
ex+1,x is the gear ratio between vertices x+1 and x, and Ex,y is the product of gear ratios on the 
heavy-edged path from x to y. 
According to Eq. (5.1), the following rule can be obtained: 
Rule 1: The local gain of g-c vs. g-c type conversion can be expressed as:

  For the right hand side KU in Table 5.3, the local gain can be derived along a similar procedure 
from Eq. (5.7) to Eq. (5.9), and the following rule can be concluded: 
Rule 5: The local gain of g-g vs. g-g type conversion between two coaxial g-g type thin edges (x, p) 
and (y, p) can be expressed as

        (5.9b) 
The local gains are summarized as shown in Tables 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3. As long as the locations of 
local input and output are identified, associated local gains can be determined according to Tables 5.1, 
5.2 and 5.3. Note that the local gains in above rules only involve the two ends, not the number of 
vertices, of a heavy-edged path. It implies that these kinematic relations can be applied to KUs with 
more than five links as long as the coaxiality and connection between local input and output satisfy 
the conditions depicted in Tables 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3. 
 
5.4. Global Propagation 
  For gear mechanisms with only one KU, kinematic propagation from input to output is completed 
in the same KU as shown in Fig. 5.3. Hence, the kinematic relation between input and output links can 
be described by Rules 1 to 5, which means that the global propagation is exactly equivalent to 
internal conversion. 
 
KU1
 
 
Figure 5.3 Global propagation in a single KU 
 
  For two KUs sharing a 2-link chain type common linkage, the output of a preceding KU is received 
directly by the succeeding KU as the input, as shown in Fig. 5.4. Considering the mechanism in Fig. 
5.2(b), θ3,5 can θ4,5 can be assigned as output and input, respectively. It can be observed that the lower 
KU is of K3-1 type in which local input θ4,5 is transmitted to local output, θ1,5, on the common linkage 
through a g-c vs. g-c type conversion. Then, θ1,5 is received by the upper KU, which is of K4-1S type, 
as local input from the common linkage and is subsequently converted into output, θ3,5 through a g-c 
68 
 
Step 1: Express the global output in terms of local input of the associated KU. The result can be 
generally expressed as: 
  )[ #]xθ θ= − ⋅outout in in LK              (5.11) 
where θout is the output, θin)L is the local input and out[Kx−#]in represents the local gain associated with 
the conversion from θin)L to θout in Kx-#. 
  For EGT 1400-1-4 with the output in K-4-1S, the relation corresponding to Eq. (5.11) can be 
written as: 
  
35
3,5 15 1,5[ 4 1 ]θ θ= − ⋅K S              (5.12) 
  For the 4-1-1 EGT in Fig. 5.1 with the output in the lower right KU, the relation corresponding to 
Eq. (5.11) can be written as: 
  
35
3,5 25 2,5[ 3 1]θ θ= − ⋅K               (5.13) 
where 35[K3−1]25 is the local gain associated with the conversion from local input, θ2,5, to the local 
output, θ3,5 in the lower right KU of EGT 4-1-1. 
Step 2: Transform the local input in Eq. (5.11) into local output of preceding KU(s). 
  According to Figs. 5.4 and 5.5, the transformation can be determined by the following cases: 
(a). For a 2-link-chain type common linkage, there is only one preceding KU, and the local output of 
the preceding KU is identical to the local input of its succeeding KU. Hence, there is no modification 
required for Eq. (5.11). 
  For the EGT in Fig. 5.2(b), the common linkage is a 2-link chain, and thus local input of K4-1S, θ1,5, 
is equal to the local output of K3-1. Hence, Eq. (5.12) needs no modification. 
(b). For a coaxial-triangle type common linkage, there are two preceding KUs from which two 
distinct local output merge into their succeeding KU. According to Eq. (5.10), Eq. (5.11) can be 
modified as: 
  ) 1 ) 2[ #] ( )xθ θ θ= − ⋅ +outout in out p out pK    (5.14) 
where θout)p1 and θout)p2 are the two local output of preceding KUs. 
  For EGT 4-1-1 in Fig. 5.1, since the lower right KU shares a coaxial-triangle type common linkage 
with preceding KUs, Eq. (5.13) can be rewritten according to Eqs. (5.10) and (5.14) as: 
  
35
3,5 25 2,4 5,4[ 3 1] [ ( )]θ θ θ= − ⋅ + −K       (5.15)

  By substituting Eqs. (5.19) and (5.20) into Eq. (5.21), we have

  Similarly, the global kinematic relation of EGT 4-1-1 can be derived by converting Eq. (5.18) 
according to Table 5.1 as:

5.5. An application to automatic transmission mechanisms 
  Figures 5.6(a) shows the functional representation of a typical transmission mechanism, which is 
used as an example by Hsieh and Tsai [45]. From Fig. 5.6(a), it can be observed that the mechanism 
has three sets of sun-planetary-ring gear systems which corresponds to the three FGEs as shown in 
Fig. 5.6(b), in which the unlabeled vertex represents the housing. According to the connection 
between FGEs, a unique FGE diagram can be constructed for the mechanism, and then the overall 
gear ratio is determined by identifying the operation modes of associated FGEs [45].

  It can be observed that input θ41 involves both the two KUs in Fig. 5.6(c). According to the 
following coaxial condition, θ4,1 can be decomposed into two dependent terms which lie in different 
KUs: 
  4,1 4,2 2,1θ θ θ= +                      (5.26) 
  Equation (26) can be related to the local output of KU1 as 
42 21
4,1 25 25 2,5{ [ 4 1 ] [ 4 1 ] }θ θ= − + − ⋅K S K S  (5.27) 
where both terms of local gains in Eq. (5.27) are associated with the g-c vs. g-g type conversion in 
KU-4-1S. 
  Rearranging Eq. (5.27) yields

2,5 42 21

where the local gains can be further expanded in terms of gear ratios according to Table 5.2. 
  By comparison with above derivation, the concept of FGEs may lead to over decomposition since 
FGEs are obtained from structural aspects rather than kinematic characteristics. Such as the second 
and the third FGE in Fig. 5.6(b), which have the same carrier, can form a single KU (KU2) that has 
coupled kinematic relations. The structure-oriented decomposition results in unnecessary 
decomposition of kinematic relations. For instance, the first gear and the second gear, which are 
considered internal conversion in a KU, have to be described as an interaction between two FGEs. 
Under the FGE-based architecture, the overall speed ratios have to be determined in each FGE and 
then combined according to operating modes to obtain the overall gear ratios. Hence, it is believed 
that KUs represent more direct and efficient modules than FGEs to determine the velocity ratio of 
gear mechanisms. 
 
5.6. Summary 
  The concept of kinematic fractionation and KUs are introduced to identify the kinematic modules in 
gear mechanisms. The concept of kinematic fractionation exposes the kinematic propagation in the 
mechanism and facilitates the determination of global kinematic relation between input and output. 
Admissible internal conversion modes and associated local gains are determined for KUs with up to 5 
74 
 
 
6.Kinematic Characteristics and Classification 
of Geared Mechanisms 
6.1. Introduction 
Geared mechanisms have been widely used as power transmission and force amplification devices in 
machines and vehicles. The input power is transmitted to the output link through a power flow path 
made up of meshing pairs and their corresponding carriers. Through analysis, kinematic relations 
between input and output links of a geared mechanism are evaluated. Although the tabular method 
and the formula method, etc. have been well developed and can solve for almost all gear train 
problems, such a procedure becomes tedious when gear trains are complex. In virtue of graph theory 
[16], the concept of fundamental circuits was applied to the kinematic analysis of geared mechanisms 
[34, 36]. By solving a set of linear equations simultaneously, the kinematic relations can be obtained 
through a series of arithmetical manipulation, where kinematic insights are barely revealed. 
Chatterjee and Tsai [44] decomposed an epicyclic geared mechanism into several fundamental geared 
entities and applied the concept to the speed ratio analysis and power loss problems. However, this 
study is only applicable for reverted type of epicyclic gear trains and for the analysis of kinematic 
relations among coaxial links. 
  Chen and Shiue [24] showed that a geared robotic mechanism can be fractionated into input units 
and transmission units. Chen [46] further verified the forward and backward gains of each unit and 
proposed a unit-by-unit evaluation procedure for the kinematic analysis of such geared robotic 
mechanisms. Although this approach is straightforward and provides clear kinematic insights in 
torque transmission problems, it is restricted to the analysis of geared robotic mechanisms. 
  Based on the concept of kinematic fractionation developed by Liu and Chen [49], motion 
transmission inside a geared mechanism can be considered as motion transmitted from input to output 
via a series of kinematic units (KUs). Liu et al. [50] further unveiled the topological structures among 
fractionated KUs, where two types of structures were identified. The local gain of each individual KU 
was formulated and the input-output relations of a geared mechanism were established. However, 
how the global kinematic relations of geared mechanisms are related to the configurations of KUs is 
not discussed. 
  Rao [51] applied genetic algorithm for the design of a geared mechanism with high speed ratio or 
transmission efficiency. Based on the concept of fundamental kinematic units, Kahraman et al. [52] 
proposed a methodology for the determination of the speed ratio for each gearing pairs according to 
76 
 
It is observed from Eq. (6.3) that, when a geared mechanism is fractionated into KUs, the total 
number of the thin edges increases, depending on the number of KUs, while the total number of heavy 
edges remains unchanged.  
Alternatively, according to the Grubler–Kutzbach criterion, the DOF of a geared mechanism can 
also be represented as 
3( 1) 2= − − −F v e h
                 (6.4) 
where v is the number of links of a geared mechanism or the number of vertices of a graph. 
  Equating Eq. (6.1) with Eq. (6.4) yields the relation between the numbers of vertices and 
turning-pair edges, 
  1= −e v                           (6.5) 
  Similarly, the numbers of turning-pair edges ei and vertices vi of the ith KU in a geared mechanism 
can be related as 
  1= +i iv e                          (6.6) 
Collecting all u fractionated KUs in a geared mechanism and making use of Eqs. (6.2) and (6.6) 
yield the total number of vertices of gear mechanisms 
1 1 1
( 1) ( 2) 2= + = + = +∑ ∑ ∑

i i iv e h h u    (6.7) 
Substituting Eq. (6.5) in Eq. (6.1), number of vertices in the graph representation of geared 
mechanisms can be expressed as 
1= + +v F h                        (6.8) 
Subtracting Eq. (6.7) from Eq. (6.8) yields the difference between the numbers of vertices of the 
graph representation and fractionated KU graph of gear mechanisms

            (6.9) 
Equation (6.9) indicates that the difference between the numbers of vertices in these two graphs is 
determined by the number of fractionated KUs and the DOF of geared mechanisms. Normally, the 
number of vertices for all fractionated KUs is more than that of a graph representation due to the 
common linkages, where some common vertices are counted repeatedly. This implies that the number 
of repeated vertices is determined by the number and the types of common linkages of KUs. Hence,

6.3. Kinematic Propagation Paths 
  A kinematic propagation path of motion represents the transmission of motion between KUs within 
a geared mechanism. Based on the configurations of KUs shown in Table 6.1, possible kinematic 
propagation paths can be established once input and output links are adequately selected. 
  In order to maintain the mobility of the geared mechanisms, the following general rules have to be 
fulfilled: 
R1: Each KU has one local input. Since the DOF of a KU is equal to 1, any KU possesses only one 
local input. 
R2: The number of global inputs is equal to the DOF of a geared mechanism. 
  Therefore, geared mechanisms pertaining to configurations I–IV have one global input, while those 
belonging to configurations V–VII possess two global inputs. Although the global input(s) of a 
geared mechanism can be designated at any KU, kinematic propagation paths with certain 
arrangements have to be excluded. According to R2, this two- DOF geared mechanism has two global 
inputs. Any two of the three KUs can be used as inputs. However, inputs at KU1-KU2, KU2-KU3, or 
KU3-KU1 are considered to be identical to each other due to the symmetry of configuration with 
regard to the topological perspective. Hence, we have the following. 
R3: Assignment of global input(s) at topologically symmetric KU(s) has to be avoided. 
  Followed by the determination of global input(s), global output(s) of a geared mechanism has to be 
chosen. Consider a six-link GKC of graph 6205-1 [47] of Fig. 6.2(a). If vertex 2 (or 6) is selected as 
the input, as indicated in Fig. 6.2(b), the adequate output will be vertex 6 (or 2). This way, 
transmission path of motion propagates from the input to pass through entire GKC, i.e., from KU1 to 
KU3 or vice versa. Since the kinematic relation

between input and output links of geared mechanisms can be derived in virtue of block diagram 
algebra. 
Referring to the system in Fig. 6.3, signal S1 is generated after input I1 passes KU1. Then,

where g1 is the local gain of KU1. Output O1 is generated after signal S1 goes through KU2 and 
becomes 
  1 2 2 1 2 1= =O g S g g I                  (6.14) 
where g2 is the local gain of KU2 and g1g2 is the global gain of the geared mechanism in Fig. 6.3. 
  For convenience, the gain of an output and its associated input in a multi-input and multi-output 
(MIMO) system are expressed in a matrix form as 
  [ ] [ ] [ ]1 1× × ×=n n m mO G I                (6.15) 
where n and m, respectively, are the numbers of outputs and inputs, G is an n*m gain matrix, I is an 
m*1 input column matrix, and O is an n*1 output column matrix. 
  Referring to the propagation path in Fig. 6.4, the global output of the GKC of graph 4-1-1 can be 
easily derived in a similar manner to Eqs. (6.13) and (6.14).

  Since there are two inputs in the geared mechanism, the output can be represented as the matrix

  Making use of the derivation procedure presented in this section, all corresponding kinematic gain 
matrices of the admissible propagation paths are obtained. The results are shown in the fourth column 
of Table 1. Note that since an entity in a gain matrix shows the influence from a specific input to a 
prescribed output, in a MIMO system, if certain inputs and outputs are not related to each other, their 
associated gains would be zero. 
  Once the global output of a geared mechanism is obtained in terms of the gains of the fractionated 
KUs, the actual output displacement of the geared mechanism can be readily obtained. Consider the 
three-KU geared mechanism of graph 4-1-1 shown in Fig. 6.4. Since angular displacements θ1,2 
andθ3,2 are the local inputs of KU1 and KU2, respectively, their local gains can be obtained as

  Note thatθi,j represents the relative angular displacement of vertex i with respective to vertex j and 
can be expressed as θi,j =θi,k – θj,k. The local gain of KU3 is

whereθ6,4 andθ5,4 are the local output and input of KU3, respectively. 
  Note that the sign of gear ratio -e1,4 in Eq. (6.25) inherits the sign of the angular output of KU1. 
Referring to the configuration of KUs shown in Fig. 6.4, the angular input displacement of KU3 can 
be expressed asθ5,4=θ5,2－θ4,2=θ5,2＋(－θ4,2).

6.6. Summary 
  A new approach based on the concept of kinematic fractionation is successfully applied in the 
identification of the topological characteristics of geared mechanisms and in the determination of the 
kinematic relations between input and output links. Using KUs as basic blocks, admissible 
configurations of up to four KUs in one- and two-DOF geared mechanisms are unveiled. By 
adequately designating inputs and outputs, all possible propagation paths of motion of geared 
mechanisms are constructed, and their corresponding gains are obtained by block diagram algebra. 
As a result, the kinematic behaviors of geared mechanisms can be classified. This, in turn, provides 
the design process with kinematic insight into the synthesis of geared mechanisms with up to four 
KUs. 
 
7.Kinematic Synthesis of One-DOF Geared 
Mechanisms According to Specified Gain Type 
7.1. Introduction 
Topological synthesis of geared kinematic chains (GKCs) had been studied intensively and the 
graphs of admissible one-DOF GKCs of up to six links had been enumerated by many researchers. 
Freudenstein [16] synthesized graphs of the one-DOF GKCs of up to five links. Tsai [18] enumerated 
the graphs of one-DOF GKCs of up to six links. Although the atlas of GKCs had been established, 
few studies had been focused on the kinematic synthesis of the admissible GKCs. Olson et al. [39] 
proposed a coincident-joint graph methodology which utilized a new graph representation for the 
topological analysis of one-DOF, five-link GKCs. Although each feasible ground, input and output 
vertices of the geared mechanisms can be established easily by this methodology, prevention of 
redundant links in a geared mechanism were not guaranteed. Rao [51] applied genetic algorithm for 
the design of a geared mechanism with high speed ratio. Salgado and Del Castillo [53] used the 
gearing power and transmission ratio curves to establish the power flow map for the design of a 
planetary gear train. Talpasanu et al. [54] developed structure matrices from the spanning tree and 
joint position of a geared mechanism for the analysis and synthesis of epicyclic gear trains with 
parallel axes. Based on the concept of fundamental kinematic units (KUs), Kahraman et al. [52] 
proposed an approach to determine of the speed ratio for each gearing pairs according to the 
structural and functional requirements of the mechanisms.

7.2.2. Kinematic behavior of single KU 
Although the global gain of a one-DOF geared mechanism can be obtained at KU level, the actual 
kinematic relation between input and output links is required in practice. In the graph representation 
of geared mechanisms, links are represented by vertices, gear pairs by heavy edges, turning pairs by 
thin edges, and each thin edge is labeled according to its associated axis location. There are two types 
of thin edges (or joints) in a geared mechanism: carrier-type (c) and gear-type (g). The carrier-type 
thin edge is referred to a thin edge connecting to a carrier vertex and a gear vertex, while the gear-type 
thin edge is referred to a thin edge connecting to both gear vertices. A gear-type thin edge can be 
formed by coaxial rearrangement [50] as the thin edges between the carrier and the two gear vertices 
possess the same axis levels. For example, since thin edges 1-5 and 1-6 have the same axis level “a” 
as shown in Fig. 7.2(a), the carrier-type thin edge 1-6 can be replaced by a gear-type thin edge 5-6 as 
shown in Figs. 7.2(c).

On the other hand, if the thin edges 5-2 and 6-2 are assigned as the input and output thin edges, 
respectively, as shown in Fig. 7.2(d), both input and output thin edges of the KU are both gear-type 
and the local gain g(6,2;5,2) is obtained as

The motion transmitted through the propagation path from local input to local output of a KU is 
referred to the internal conversion of a KU. Three internal conversion modes of a KU are identified as 
{c, c}, {c, g} and {g, g} types. If both thin edges of the input and output of a KU are carrier-type, the 
internal conversion mode it is referred to a {c, c} type and, based on Eq. (7.1), the local gain of the 
KU is represented as 
g E=
                            (7.4) 
If the thin edges of the input and output of a KU are carrier-type and gear-type respectively, it is 
referred to a {c, g} type and, based on Eq. (7.2), the local gain of the KU can be expressed as 
g 1 E= −
                          (7.5) 
If the thin edges of input and output are both gear-type, it is referred to a {g, g} type and, based on 
Eq. (7.3), the local gain of the KU can be expressed as

                         (7.6) 
where E and E’ represent two different gear ratios. 
Combing the three possible internal conversion modes of a KU, the global gains of one-DOF, 
multiple-KU geared mechanisms can be obtained and classified into four types: ordinary, subtractive, 
fractional and composite types as listed in Table 7.2 where u is the number of KUs and n is the 
number of vertices. If the internal conversion modes of KUs of a geared mechanism are all {c, c} 
types, it has the global gain of the ordinary type. If a geared mechanism possesses at least one {c, g} 
or one {g, g} internal conversion mode with others being {c, c} types, it has a global gain of the

7.3. Admissible Graphs with Ground Adjacent Input/Output 
In addition to the configuration and the common linkages of KUs, the kinematic behavior of a 
geared mechanism is also affected by the assignment of ground, input and output links. However, 
since we limit ourselves to the design of one-DOF, single-output geared mechanisms, any assignment 
of ground, input and output links leading to more than one output links should be prevented. 
 
7.3.1. Basic Requirements 
  Assignment of ground, input and output may result in two types of redundancy: One is referred to 
the redundancy of KU(s), and the other is referred to the redundancy of links. Redundancy of KUs 
only occurs in multiple-KU geared mechanisms.  To avoid redundancy of KUs, input and output KU 
has to be assigned to the one of the end KUs of the geared mechanism, respectively, otherwise, 
96 
 
coaxial rearrangement between any two generalized end vertices possible. This, in turn, implies that, 
for vg=3, all three generalized vertices have to be coaxial. Hence, 
C2: Any geared mechanism with three coaxial generalized end vertices is an admissible mechanism. 
  For non-fractionated geared mechanisms with vg=2, since the carrier vertex is adjacent to the two 
generalized end vertices, one possible assignment is to assign input and output links to the two 
generalized end vertices  and ground to the carrier. Hence, all non fractionated geared mechanisms 
with vg=2 are admissible mechanisms. However, for fractionated geared mechanisms, since the two 
generalized end vertices are pertaining to the two end KUs, respectively, input and output links can be 
assigned to the two generalized end vertices and ground to the vertex adjacent to both generalized end 
vertices. In another words, if there exists a vertex which is commonly shared by the two end KUs and 
connected to the two generalized end vertices by thin edges, an admissible fractionated geared 
mechanism can be obtained. Hence, 
C3: For the case of two generalized end vertices, all non fractionated geared mechanisms are 
admissible mechanisms, and fractionated geared mechanisms are admissible mechanisms if there 
exists a vertex commonly shared by the two end KUs and connected to the two generalized end 
vertices by thin edges. 
Based on C1 through C3, the admissible graphs of the one-DOF, up to six-link geared mechanisms 
with respect to the number of generalized end vertices can be identified. As a consequence, sixty-six 
graphs of the geared mechanisms in the atlas are excluded by C1 through C3, where eleven graphs by 
C1, thirty-four graphs by C2, eighteen graphs by C3, and thirty-two admissible graphs of geared 
mechanisms are obtained. Results are shown in Table 7.2, where two admissible non-fractionated 
geared mechanisms with vg=3 are tabulated in Table 7.2(a), eighteen non-fractionated geared 
mechanisms with vg=2 in Table 7.2(b) and twelve fractionated geared mechanisms with vg=2 in Table 
7.2(c). In the table, the end vertices are represented by shaded circle and pseudo end vertices 
represented by shaded square. Note that for one-DOF, up to six-link geared mechanisms with three 
generalized end vertices, only non-fractionated geared mechanisms are identified as admissible 
graphs.

7.4.2. Single-KU geared mechanisms with two non-coaxial generalized end vertices 
  According to C3, ground is assigned to the carrier and input and output links are assigned to the 
generalized end vertices, and thus the thin edges between ground and input/output are all carrier-type. 
Hence, 
S2. For the single-KU mechanisms with two generalized end vertices, ground is assigned to the 
carrier and input and output links are assigned to the generalized end vertices. The global gain is 
ordinary type. 
  For non-coaxial generalized end vertices, only S2 can be applied. 
 
7.4.3. Single-KU geared mechanisms with two coaxial generalized end vertices 
  For single-KU geared mechanisms with two coaxial generalized end vertices, alternatives for the 
assignment of ground, input and output can be obtained: 
  If ground is assigned to carrier and input and output links are assigned to the two generalized end 
vertex, respectively, the thin edge type between ground and input/output links are all carrier-type and 
the global gain is ordinary type. 
  If ground is assigned to one of the generalized end vertices and input and output links are assigned 
to carrier and another generalized end vertex, respectively, the thin edge type between ground and 
input/output links are carrier- and gear- type and the global gain is subtractive type. 
  If there is a gear vertex coaxial to the generalized end vertices and ground, input and output are 
assigned to any of the three coaxial gear vertices, the thin edge type between ground and input/output 
links are all gear-type and the global gain is fractional type. Hence, 
S3. For the single-KU mechanisms with two coaxial generalized end vertices, 
S3.1. ground is assigned to carrier and input and output links are assigned to the two generalized end 
vertex, respectively, for ordinary gain type; 
S3.2. ground is assigned to one of the generalized end vertices and input and output links are 
assigned to carrier and another generalized end vertex, respectively, for subtractive gain type;  
S3.3. there must exist a gear vertex coaxial to the generalized end vertices and ground, input and 
output links are assigned to any of the three coaxial gear vertices for fractional gain type. 
 
7.4.4. Multiple-KU geared mechanisms with two non-coaxial generalized end vertices 
  For a multiple-KU geared mechanism with two non-coaxial generalized end vertices, according 
to C3, input and output links must be assigned to the two generalized end vertices and ground to the

  Since vertices 1, 2, 5 and 6 are coaxial, ground, input and output of the geared mechanisms in Figs. 
7.4(a) and 7.4(b) can be rearranged to the geared mechanisms as shown in Fig. 7.4(c) and 7.4(d), 
respectively. The global gains of the geared mechanisms are obtained in the derived forms as

  (7.8b) 
  Based on Eqs. (7.7) and (7.8), it is concluded that, as ground and the input link are exchanged, the 
derived gain of a geared mechanism is equal to one minus the original gain, i.e., (1-Gorg). Similarly, 
as ground and the output link are exchanged, the derived gain is equal to 1/(1-(1/Gorg)) or 
Gorg/(Gorg-1) and, as the input and output links are exchanged, the new gain becomes the reciprocal of 
the original gain, i.e., 1/Gorg. Thus, by defining the (1-Gorg) and Gorg/(Gorg-1) as the derived 
subtractive and fractional gain type, respectively, the rules in order to obtain the derived gain type 
can be established as follows. 
M2. For the multiple-KU mechanisms with two coaxial generalized end vertices, M1 is applied to the 
assignment of ground, input and output, and, the desired gain type of the geared mechanisms can be 
obtained following M1.1 through M1.3. 
M3. For the multiple-KU mechanisms with two coaxial generalized end vertices, and 
M3.1. if ground and input link obtained from the assignment of M2 are exchanged, a derived 
subtractive gain type can be obtained. 
M3.2. if ground and output link obtained from the assignment of M2 are exchanged, a derived

7.5. Kinematic Synthesis of Geared Mechanisms 
  Since the global gain of a one-DOF, single-output, geared mechanism is determined by the thin 
edge types of common linkages and the assignment of ground, input and output links, the kinematic 
synthesis of geared mechanism according to a specified global gain type can be accomplished by 
choosing graphs with appropriate structure, accompanied by the suitable assignment of ground, input 
and output links. 
 
7.5.1. Design of a geared mechanism with specified gain type – an example 
  Design of a one-DOF geared mechanism of up to six links with subtractive gain type is presented 
as an example for the illustration of the methodology proposed in this study. According to and S3, a 
subtractive gain can only be obtained by single-KU mechanisms with two coaxial end vertices, while, 
according to M1 and M2, a subtractive gain type can only be obtained by multiple-KU mechanisms 
with two coaxial or non-coaxial generalized end vertices. 
Single-KU mechanisms with two coaxial end vertices: 
  According to S1, a single-KU geared mechanism with three coaxial generalized end vertices 
always yields fractional gain type and, according to S2, a single-KU geared mechanism with two 
non-coaxial generalized end vertices always yields ordinary gain type. Hence, mechanisms with two 
coaxial generalized end vertices are considered. According to S3, in order to obtain the subtractive 
gain type, ground has to be assigned to one of the generalized end vertices and input and output are 
assigned to the carrier and the other generalized end vertex, respectively. Consequently, the feasible 
single-KU geared mechanisms of subtractive gain type are 2200-2a, 2210-3c, 6503-4, 6503-6, 6503-7, 
and 6503-8 as shown in Table 7.2(b). 
Multiple-KU mechanisms with (c, c) type common linkage 
  The global gain of a multiple-KU mechanism depends on the types of thin edges of the common 
linkages and the global input/output. According to M1 and M2, the KUs of the geared mechanism 
should comprise of at least one internal conversion modes of {c, g} type with all others being {c, c} 
type. This can be achieved by mechanisms with (i) all common linkage of (c, c) type and at least one 
global input/output thin edge of gear-type type, or (ii) at least one common linkage of (c, g) or (g, g) 
type and all global input/output thin edges of carrier-type. Note that, if a common linkage of (c, g) or 
(g, g) type exists and one of the gear-type thin edge is on the common linkage of the end KU, the 
global input/output thin edge has to be a carrier-type thin edge. Otherwise, the subtractive gain type 
can not be achieved. Similarly, for the mechanisms with more than one (c, g) or (g, g) type common 
linkages, an internal conversion mode of {g, g} type may be formed, resulting in a fractional-type or

7.5.2. Classification of one-DOF geared mechanisms of up to six-link 
  Based on S1, S2, S3, M1 and M2, all admissible mechanisms of ordinary and fractional gain type 
can be obtained through the similar procedure demonstrated in previous section. According to S1 
through S3, the single-KU mechanisms of ordinary gain type can be obtained from the graphs with 
two generalized end vertices by assigning ground to the carrier. Note that, since the assignment of the 
ground vertex according to M1 and M2 always result in a gear-type global input/output, one-DOF, up 
to six-link, multiple-KU mechanisms of ordinary gain type can not be obtained. The admissible 
single-KU mechanisms of ordinary gain type with the assignment of ground, input and output are 
listed in Table 7.4. 
  According to S1, all single-KU mechanisms are fractional type and, according to S1 and S3, the 
single-KU mechanisms with two coaxial generalized end vertices can be fractional type if there is a 
vertex coaxial to the two generalized end vertices. For multiple-KU mechanisms, according to M1 
and M2, as long as at least one internal conversion mode of {g, g} type is formed, the global gain of 
108 
 
7.6. Summary 
  The kinematic behavior of one-DOF, up to six-link geared mechanisms is analyzed. It is shown that 
the global input and output relation of a single-KU geared mechanism is determined by the types of 
the input and output thin edges, while that of a multiple-KU geared mechanism depends on the types 
of thin edges of the common linkages and the assignment of ground, input and output links. Based on 
the requirements of ground-adjacent input/output and prevention of redundant links, thirty-two 
admissible graphs are obtained from the ninety-eight graphs enumerated in the atlas. It is shown that 
one-DOF, up to six-link geared mechanisms only yield the global gains of ordinary, subtractive and 
fractional types, while composite type can not be obtained. Rules for the assignment of ground and 
input and output are established to obtain a desired gain types and classification of the admissible 
geared mechanisms according to the global gain types is proposed. As a result, the kinematic 
synthesis of a one-DOF, six-link geared mechanisms according to their gain types can be easily 
accomplished following the systematic methodology provided in this work. 
 
8.Kinematic Analysis of CSRSC 
  In the graph representation of geared mechanisms, links are represented by vertices, gear pairs by 
heavy edges, turning pairs by thin edges, and each thin edge is labeled according to the associated 
axis. Figure 2(a) shows the graph representation of CSRSC, which is a 9-link geared mechanism. 
In which the rigid circle denotes the ground, the rigid rectangle the input, and the hallow rectangle 
the output. The number of DOF of geared mechanism can be expressed as: 
 = −F E H  (1) 
where F is the number of DOF of geared mechanism, E the number of thin edges, and H the number 
of heavy edges. 
  It can be seen that there are eight thin edges and six heavy edges in CSRSC; Hence, CSRSC is a 
2-DOF geared mechanism. 
  Via the concept of kinematic fractionation, CSRSC can be fractionated into KUs, and the kinematic 
characteristics are discussed as follows. 
8.1. Kinematic Fractionation 
  In order to process the conceptual synthesis of CSRSC, it requires kinematic analysis to clarify the 
kinematic characteristics. Liu and Chen [5] exposed that the geared mechanism can be considered as 
the combination of KUs. A KU is composed of a carrier and all gears on it, which the number of DOF 
is equal to one [7]. The procedure of kinematic fractionation [5] of CSRSC into KUs is as follows: 
110 
 
 
Figure 2 Graph of CSRSC 
 
 
Step 3: Build gear-carrier pairs. Add a transfer vertex as a carrier in each sub-graph, and connect the 
gear-carrier pairs by thin edges. Each thin edge is then labeled as its corresponding axis orientation. 
Four KUs, which are denoted as KU1, KU2, KU3, and KU4, can hence be generated as shown in Fig. 
2(d). 
Step 4: Rearrange the coaxial relation to show the common linkage. 
  In each KU obtained by Step 3, identify the vertices, which are shared as common links with the 
other sub-graphs, and connect these vertices with a thin edge. Since vertices 5 and 9 in Fig. 2(d) have 
the same axis label, the gear-carrier thin edges on the two vertices are coaxial. Hence, a thin edge 
between vertices 5 and 9 can be formed by coaxial rearrangement without changing kinematic 
characteristics of the mechanism [9]. Similarly, a thin edge can be formed between vertices 2 and 9. 
Then select the common links to form common linkages, CSRSC can hence be regarded as the 
combination of KUs, as shown in Fig. 2(e). In which the coaxial triangles are denoted by short thin 
edges. 
  It can be seen that kinematic fractionation will cause the increase of the number of thin edges, that 
is, there is a repeat thin edge in both the coaxial triangle and 2-link chain type common linkages [6]. 
Equation (1) can then be rewritten as: 
 = − − −F E H t c  (2) 
where t is the number of 2-link chain type common linkages, and c the number of coaxial triangle type 
common linkages. 
  Since the number of DOF of a KU is equal to one, we have: 
 
=
− = − =∑
u
i i
i 1
E H e h u  (3) 
where ei is the number of thin edges in ith KU, hi the number of heavy edges in ith KU, and u the 
number of KUs in the geared mechanism. 
Substitute Eq. (3) into Eq. (2), we have: 
 
=
= − − − = − +∑
u

  Equation (4) can also be expressed as: 
112 
 
transmission can be determined, and the kinematic propagation path of CSRSC can be generated [6], 
as shown in Fig. 3(a). 
 
9.Kinematic Characteristics of CSRSC 
  Due to the kinematic propagation path, the motion transmission in the geared mechanism is much 
lucid, and the kinematic relation can be derived efficiently. By combining the kinematic propagation 
path and the local gains of the KUs, the kinematic relation in CSRSC can be efficiently derived. In 
which the local gain is the gear ratio from local input to the local output in a KU. 
  As shown in Fig. 3(a), a new signal, S1, is generated after I1 passes KU1. S1 can be expressed as: 
 = 1 1S1 I G  (6) 
where G1 is the local gain of KU1. 
  Similarly, S2 can be expressed as: 
 = 2 2S2 I G  (7) 
where G2 is the local gain of path 1 in KU2. 
  S3 is equal to the sum of S1 and S2, thus: 
 = + = +1 1 2 2S3 S1 S2 I G I G  (8) 
From Fig. 3(a), we can have: 
 = 2 2S4 I G'  (9) 
where G’2 is the local gain of path 2 in KU2. 
 = × = +3 1 1 2 2 3S5 S3 G ( I G I G )G  (10) 
where G3 is the local gain of KU3.

where G4 is the local gain of KU4. 
114 
 
branch type path pattern is the sum of products. Hence, to fulfill the functional requirements of 
CSRSC, the kinematic propagation path must contain the branch type path pattern. Thus, we have: 
Char. 4: There should be branch type path pattern in the kinematic propagation path of the 
mechanism. 
  Due to the characteristics, the topological structures can be synthesized directing to meet the 
characteristics. 
 
10.Topological Synthesis 
10.1. Concept of Synthesis 
  The kinematic propagation path exposes the kinematic relation in the geared mechanism lucidly. 
Thus, the kinematic propagation path can be a useful tool for the design of geared mechanism; the 
topological structure can be synthesized based on the path. 
  Via the exposure of possible kinematic propagation paths of the configurations of connections of 
KUs, the kinematic characteristics of the paths are clarified, and the kinematic behavior of the 
configurations can be then predicted. Hence, the correspondences between topological and kinematic 
characteristics are unveiled. 
  In the design procedure of geared mechanism, an appropriate kinematic propagation path can 
hence be found according to the required kinematic characteristics, and the configuration of 
connection of KUs is determined thereafter. Then via putting links in each KU in the configuration, 
innovative designs can be obtained. Hence, KU is taken as the module of synthesizing the topological 
structure of geared mechanism. This concept provides an approach of topological synthesis with 
more kinematic insight; the topological structures are synthesized directing to the required kinematic 
behavior. 
 
10.2. Approach for Synthesis 
  To satisfy the functional requirements of CSRSC, the innovative designs should have Char. 1, 2, 3, 
and 4. In other words, Char. 1, 2, 3, and 4 are the constraints to the topological synthesis of CSRSC. 
  Since CSRSC is a 2-DOF 4-KU mechanism, the topological synthesis is processed to create 
2-DOF 4-KU topological structures. 
  For 2-DOF 4-KU GKCs, from Eq. (5), we have: 
 4 2 t c= + +  (13) 
  Based on Eq. (13), connections of KUs in 2-DOF 4-KU GKCs can be obtained. Chen and Chang [6]

KUs in the configuration is the same; one is symmetric respectively to the vertical axis, the other is 
symmetric respectively to the horizontal axis. 
Step b. Determine the locations of gear pairs in each KU. 
  Step (a) determines the possible formations of configurations of KUs. However, in order to obtain 
the new structures, we have to put links into each location of KU. 
  The GKCs are non-isomorphic if the adjacency between the links is different; therefore, numerous 
innovative topological structures can be created by changing the locations of gear pairs in each KU. 
  For the configuration composed of four 3-link KUs, the new topological structures can be created 
by changing the gear pairs in KU1 and KU4. There are two 7-link non-isomorphic topological 
structures, as shown in Table 2(b). In which the structures are label as 7-a-#. Where # is the serial 
number of the structure. 
  Similarly, though there are only two 8-link configurations of KUs, six 8-link non-isomorphic 
topological structures can be enumerated by changing the location of gear pairs in each KU, as shown 
in Table 2(c) and 2(d)

which the end vertex is the terminal of the kinematic propagation path. 
R.4: The output should be located at the left end links or at the KUs without ground or input links to 
avoid the redundancy. 
  According to R.1, R.2, R.3, and R.4, the new designs can be attained by assigning the ground, 
input and output links, as shown in Table 2(b), 2(c), and 2(d). Since the configurations of the CSRSC 
are quite symmetric, the isomorphic check is needed during the design procedure, the enumeration of 
topological structures and the arrangement of locations of ports, to exclude the isomorphic 
configurations. Table 2 shows the non-isomorphic topological structures and innovative designs 
generated by above-mentioned design procedure. 
  Since the kinematic propagation paths of the new designs are the same to the original, by assigning 
the gear ratios, the new designs can satisfy the functional requirements thereafter. For instance, the 
assignment of gear ratios of 7-a-1-1 can be as what follows. 
  In virtue of the derivation of path gain, the kinematic relation between input and output can be 
expressed as: 
 = + +1 1 2 4 2 2 3 4 3 4O I G G G I ( G G G G' G ) (14) 
  In order to eliminate the influence of I2 to the output, we have: 
 + =2 3 4 3 4G G G G' G 0  (15) 
  Due to the adjacency in 7-a-1-1, the local gains in Eq. (15) can be expressed as: 
=1 2,1G e  (16) 
=2 1,5G e  (17) 
= −3G 1  (18) 
=3 3,6G' e  (19) 
=4 5,7G e  (20) 
  Substitute Eq. (17), (18), (19), and (20) into Eq. (15), we have: 
3,6 1,5e e=  (21) 
Equation (21) exposes the constraint to the gear ratio of 7-a-1-1 to satisfy the functional 
requirement. Figure 4 shows the functional representation of the graphs in Table 2(b). 
From above demonstration, this approach for topological synthesis of geared mechanism provides 
a systematic and efficient design procedure directing to the functional requirements. Via the exposure

The type A hybrid system used single primary motor is proposed. The advantages of this system 
are as following. First, the hybrid transmission uses one motor only. Structure of single motor hybrid 
transmission is not complicated as multi-motor. Second, the only one motor used in system is a 
primary motor. The primary motor can work as a primary power to drive vehicle. Hence, we limit the 
research to single primary motor hybrid transmission. 
 
14.Topology of Hybrid Transmission 
14.1. Introduction 
  In this chapter, type A can be grouped into seven cases by the structure of transmission. We will 
develop a produce to analyze the topologies of transmission. In order to analyze the topology of 
hybrid transmission, we need to define the topology definitions. 
Graph Representation 
  Geared mechanisms have being used widely as hybrid transmission. In the graph representation, 
links are represented by vertices, gear pairs are represented by heavy edges, and turning pairs are 
represented by thin edges, which are labeled according to its axis orientation. The design concept of 
hybrid transmission can be shown by graph representation [18]. 
In machine design, there are various types of clutches, such as plate or band, dry or wet, single plate 
or multiple plates, etc. By the clutches functions, they can be categorized into only two types [19]. 
One is the rotating clutch for connecting two rotating links. The other is band clutch that is used to fix 
a moving link on the ground .The connected links would be forced to rotate at the same angular 
velocity, and be coupled to a single link. Hence, the links connected by the clutches must be co-axial 
links. 
The fundamental structure 
  We limit ourselves to fundamental structure of hybrid transmission. The fundamental structure is 
defined as following. First, the clutch control devices are not considered due to the control device is 
not the components of the geared mechanism. Hence, the clutch control devices are not considered in 
hybrid transmission. 
  Second, the ordinary gear train (OGT) is excluded because of additional OGT in the transmission is 
used to change power transmit path or function as a final reduction. An example as shown in Fig. 3.1, 
an OGT is composed of link 5, link 3 and ground, and link 5 can be excludes. 
 
132 
 
  During the braking periods, the kinematic energy of the vehicle is absorbed by generator to charge 
the batteries. 
  In hybrid transmission, the link used as input and output must be co-axial links. According to motor 
and engine of operating modes, the requirement of number of co-axial links can be defined. The 
number of co-axial links of operating modes is shown in Table 3.1. A “+” denotes that motor, engine 
or output connects to co-axial links. In motor mode and engine mode, two co-axial links are used. 
Power mode and charging mode use three co-axial links. In regenerative mode, it is can use two 
co-axial links for output and motor or three co-axial links for engine, motor and output. 
  In 2-DOF power mode, the engine and motor are independent input. In 1-DOF power mode, the 
angular velocity of link that connects to motor depends on engine. In 1-DOF and 2-DOF charging 
mode, the generator is an output. 
 
14.2. Topology of single motor hybrid transmission 
Base topology and sub-topology 
  Due to the activities of clutches, the transmission topology in different modes and sub-modes are 
distinct from each other. Thus, we define base topology of the transmission as following: 
1. Base topology includes whole links used in every operating mode. 
2. Cut link must be shown when base topology is fractionated. 
Hence, base topology can represent all links used in operating modes. The base topology is the 
variation base of the structure, and we call the topology changed from base topology as sub-topology. 
We use two symbols to represent the variation between base topology and sub-topology: 
A(x,G)：link x connects to Ground 
B(x,y)：two co-axial links (x and y) connects to each other 
The degeneration of topologies with parallel edges 
  In this chapter, there are two parallel edges, thin or heavy, between two links due to connection of 
links. As shown in Fig.3.2, condition 1 is that one heavy edge and one thin edge between two links, 
condition 2 is that two heavy edges between two links. In condition 1, one revolute joint constrains 
two DOF and one gear pair constrains one two DOF. Hence, three DOF of link 2 relative to link 1 
have constrained, and link 1 and link 2 can be considered as single link. In condition 2, the carrier link, 
such as link 3, is must considered together. Two gear pairs make DOF of gear chain that is composed 
of three links becomes zero. Thus, three links can be considered as a single link in condition 2.

modes correspond to topologies, the clutch engagements and motor condition of operating modes, 
number of DOF, and number of link are described. 
topology, such as base topology, the mechanism uses two input sources. In one-DOF sub-topology, 
the mechanism also can use two input sources and power from motor works as an assist input because 
of sub-topology has enough number of co-axial link to use. 
The base topology in case 1 is composed of a 6-link GKC and a 2-link chain. The two-DOF 
fractionated variable mechanism becomes to a one DOF fractionated mechanism or a one DOF 
non-fractionated mechanism by the connection between the co-axial links.

b. Case 2: U.S. Patent US6344008 [26] 
The functional representation and topologies of case 2 are shown in Fig. 3.6 [26]. The topologies of 
case 2 are one base topology and three sub-topologies. As shown in Table 3.5, the operating modes 
correspond to topologies, the clutch engagements and motor condition of operating modes, number of 
DOF, and number of link are described. 
The mechanism of case 2 is a two-DOF fractionated variable mechanism. In two-DOF base 
topology, the mechanism uses two input sources. In one-DOF sub-topology, the mechanism also can 
use two input sources, and power from motor works as an assist input because of sub-topology has 
enough number of co-axial link to use. 
The base topology in case 2 is composed of a 6-link GKC and a 2-link chain. The two-DOF 
fractionated variable mechanism becomes to a one DOF fractionated mechanism or a one DOF 
non-fractionated mechanism by the connection between the co-axial links. 
The power from engine transmits to an additional transmission, such as a belt driving mechanism 
before to hybrid transmission. The belt driving mechanism works a continuous variable transmission 
(CVT) and can provide speed ratio of engine input. That design of two transmissions used is called a 
two stages transmission.

  The mechanism of case 3 has been introduced in three patents. The functional representation and 
topologies of case 3 are shown in Fig. 3.7 [27-29]. The topologies of case 3 are one base topology and 
two sub-topologies. As shown in Table 3.6, the operating modes correspond to topologies, the clutch 
engagements and motor condition of operating modes, number of DOF, and number of link are 
described.

  The base topology in case 6 is composed of two 4-link GKCs, one GKC has ground link. The 
two-DOF fractionated variable mechanism becomes to a one DOF non-fractionated mechanism by 
the connection between the co-axial links. 
  The power from engine transmits to an additional transmission before to hybrid transmission. That 
design of two transmissions used is called a two stages transmission.

ratios. For the number of co-axial links m of 2-DOF transmission, the number of speed ratios nm in 
1-DOF condition can be obtained as Eq.1. 
 mn (m 1)(m 2)= − −   (1) 
  In general, one co-axial link is always used to be output link for vehicle. Hence, the Eq.1 can be 
written as 
 mn (m 1)(m 2)= − −  (2) 
  For a 4 speeds and 1 reverse gear transmission, we can have 
 (m 1)(m 2) 5− − ≥  (3) 
  From Eq.3, the number of co-axial links m must be 4 at least. 
  In hybrid transmission, it can be seen that the number of co-axial links is decreased one from base 
topology to sub-topology. In order to have 4 co-axial links in 2-DOF topology, the number of co-axial 
links of 3-DOF base topology must be five at least. Hence, we can have that an n-DOF base topology 
must have n+2 co-axial links at least. 
  When the number of co-axial links of 2-DOF topology is four, the number of co-axial link of 
1-DOF sub-topology is equal to three. Based on five operating modes as shown in Table 3.1, three 
co-axial links of 1-DOF mode can satisfied every mode, such as 1-DOF power mode and 1-DOF 
charging mode. From above, we can obtain : 
C2. The number of co-axial links of base topology must be n+2 at least, where n is the number of 
DOF of base topology. 
Since characteristics have been exposed, it is believed that the admissible topology can be 
developed from existing atlases. From the characteristics, we can obtain base topology of admissible 
hybrid transmission, but the sub-topologies don’t de defined. Hence, the relation between base 
topology and sub-topologies must be defined, and the admissible sub-topologies can de obtained 
from base topology. 
 
15.3. Characteristics of co-axial connection from base topology to sub-topology 
  The variations of topology are based on the connection of co-axial links. The characteristics of 
topology only can develop the base topology. In order to determine the relation between base 
topology and sub-topology, we should to find the characteristics from base topology to sub-topology. 
  The connection of co-axial links can reduce one link and one revolute joint of topology. With the 
DOF equation of planar m-link topology as following, F is DOF of base topology: 
 1 2F 3(m 1) 2J J= − − −  (4)

15.4. Other characteristics 
End vertex of topology 
  From topologies of chapter 3, it can be seen that end vertex of topology must be co-axial links. End 
vertex of a GKC is on an open end of the heavy-edged path of a unique KU [21]. In transmission, 
input and output link must be co-axial links. And the end vertex that doesn’t select as input and output 
is a redundant link. Hence, the end vertex that isn’t co-axial link be redundant. For example as Fig.4.4, 
link 1, link 2 and link 3 are co-axial links, and link 5 is an end vertex. Link 5 must be redundant 
because of it can’t used as an input or an output. Hence, the 5-link GKC is equivalent as a 4-link GKC 
that made up of link 1 ~ link 4. We can have 
C4. The end vertex of topology must be co-axial link.

Isomorphic sub-topology 
  By connection of co-axial links, base topology can be changed into sub-topology. As shown in 
Fig.4.5, such as from case 1 and case 5, it can be seen non-isomorphic base topologies can be changed 
into isomorphic sub-topology. Hence, we have

system is proposed. 
b. Topologies of single motor hybrid transmissions 
  The topologies of single primary motor hybrid transmission have been introduced. We defined base 
topology and sub-topology of hybrid transmission. Therefore, corresponding operating modes of 
topologies have been exposed. Hence, the characteristics of topologies can be found. 
c. Characteristics of hybrid transmission 
  It is shown that n-DOF hybrid transmission can be considered as an n-1 GKC and a 1-DOF ground 
unit. The characteristics of base topology are addressed, and the co-axial link connection between 
base topology and sub-topology are discussed and addressed. 
With the characteristics, the base topology of hybrid transmission can be synthesis from existing 
atlases as an illustrative example. Furthermore, the sub-topology variation also can be determined.

Design of Perfectly 
Statically Balanced 
One-DOF Planar Linkages 
with Revolute Joints Only 
 
 
A systematic methodology for the design of a statically balanced, single degree-of-freedom 
planar linkage is presented. This design methodology is based on the concept of 
conservation of potential energy, formulated by the use of complex number notations as 
link vectors of the linkage. By incorporating the loop closure equations and the kinematic 
constraints, the gravitational potential energy of the system can be formulated as the 
function of the vectors of all ground-adjacent links. The balance of the gravitational 
potential energy of the system is then accomplished by the elastic potential energy of a zero 
free-length spring on each ground-adjacent link of the linkage. As a result, spring 
constants and installation configurations of the ground-attached springs are obtained. 
Since the variation of the gravitational potential energy of the linkage at all configurations 
can be fully compensated by that of the elastic potential energy of the ground-attached 
springs, this methodology provides an exact solution for the design of a general spring 
balancing mechanism without auxiliary parallel links. Illustrations of the methodology are 
successfully demonstrated by the spring balancing designs of a general Stephenson-III 
type six-bar linkage and a Watt-I type six-bar linkage with parallel motion.   
 
  
1  Introduction 
 
  Statically balanced mechanisms are capable of self-sustaining 
the system payloads and require little external actuating force to 
move objects in a vertical plane motion. Numerous applications of 
such mechanisms had been employed in the designs of 
angle-poised lamps [1], surgical light apparatus [2-4], 
weight-lifting crane [5, 6], and robot support arm [7, 8], etc. 
Literature showed that the static balance of a mechanism could be 
achieved by the counterweight method, the joint friction method, 
or the springs and auxiliary parallel links method, etc. Among 
them, the counterweight method needs to add additional masses to 
the system and it may undermine the strength of links as the 
payload increases, while the joint friction method facilitates 
abrasive force of a joint to counterbalance the gravitational forces 
of the system and it may cause the unanticipated failure of the 
system as the joint friction decays. On the other hand, the springs 
and parallel auxiliary links method was used as an alternative for 
the design of a statically balanced mechanism. By tracking the 
center of mass of a mechanism at various configurations, many 
spring balancing mechanisms (SBMs) are successfully 
implemented by this method [9-11]. Over the years, the “perfect” 
spring balances of a single link [1, 12, 13], single 
degree-of-freedom (DOF) planar linkages [14] and spatial 
multi-DOF mechanisms [11, 15, 16] were investigated. The 
“perfect equilibration” refers to a system which is in static 
equilibrium at its all configurations where the effect of gravity is 
fully eliminated from the system of interest [13, 17]. Most of the 
design methodologies use auxiliary parallel links, forming 
parallelograms, along with a number of springs attached between 
the linkage and the auxiliary links to compensate for the variation 
of the gravitational forces of a linkage. However, the use of 
auxiliary parallel links induces extra loadings to the system and 
complicates the arrangement of links and springs to avoid motion 
interferences. Such a methodology also increases system inertia 
and, thus, sacrifices its most advantaged aspect in comparison 
with the counterweight method. Few studies had been focused on 
the design of a perfectly statically balanced mechanism using only 
linear springs. Wongratanaphisan and Cole [18] analyzed a 
four-bar linkage suspended by linear springs without auxiliary 
parallel links. They studied the sensitivity of the potential energy 
of the system and showed that a four-bar linkage can be perfectly 
balanced only when certain symmetric geometry and mass 
conditions were satisfied. Shieh et al. [19] proposed a 
methodology for the design of a spring balancing general four-bar 
linkage without auxiliary parallel links. However, the static 
balance of SBMs of higher links was not investigated.  
  In this paper, a systematic methodology based on the concept of 
conservation of potential energy is proposed for the design of a 
statically balanced, one-DOF, all-revolute, planar linkage without 
the use of auxiliary parallel links. In the methodology, the 
gravitational forces of the feasible linkages with any geometry or

on the path from point O to the mass center of link i, si is the 
position vector of mass center Mi from the pre-connected joint of 
link i, and ps,i is the constant transformation coefficient of vector ri 
to vector si. 
Hence, the gravitational potential energy of link i can be expressed

where g represents the vector of the gravitational acceleration, 
pointing downwards. The negative sign in Eq. (3) implies that the 
maximum gravitational energy of link i is at the highest position of 
its mass center.  
Note that, for a closed-loop, planar linkage, the path selected from 
the reference coordinate to the mass center Mi is not unique, and 
thus the representation of Eq. (3) is also not unique. By collecting 
all constant coefficients for each link vector ri, the overall 
gravitational potential energy of an n-link planar linkage becomes

where ci, expressed in exponential form of complex number, is a

  Equation (4) indicates that the gravitational potential energy of 
an n-link planar linkage can be expressed by the inner product of 
vector g and a vector formed by the linear combination of r1, 
r2, …, rn. However, since the n link vectors of a closed-loop planar 
linkage are not mutually linearly independent, ci may be different 
and a unique expression of ci is not available. Hence, the number 
of the linearly independent link vectors used in the formulation of 
the gravitational potential energy in Eq. (4) has to be identified. 
 
 3.2  Kinematic constraints of a linkage system 
 
  Kinematic constraints of a planar linkage confine the relative 
motions among links. In general, a linear kinematic constraint 
equation can be expressed as

  (5) 
where qk is the constant coefficient and qk can be zero, a real or a 
complex number.  
Assume qk =0 for k ≠ i, j , Eq. (5) is reduced to

||( αieq ==     (6b) 
where q = -(qj/qi), α is the angle measured from vectors rj to ri, and 
(|ri |/|rj |) is the elongation ratio of the magnitudes of vector ri with 
respect to rj.  
The kinematic constraint depicted in Eq. (6) suggests that links i 
and j have the same angular velocity, i.e., links i and j are always 
kept in a same relative angle of orientation. If links i and j are 
adjacent, they are considered rigidly connected since there is no 
relative motion between the two links. However, if links i and j are 
not adjacent, the two links are in parallel motion and Eq. (6) is 
referred to the case where the two links are subjected to a 
kinematic constraint of parallel motion. A parallel kinematic 
constraint can be resulted from the special arrangement of the link 
dimensions, e.g., the lengths of the parallel links of a 
parallelogram must be equal.  
On the other hand, for a multi-loop, planar linkage, each 
independent loop represents a linear kinematic constraint to the 
motion of the links of the planar linkage. The loop closure 
equation of loop k can be represented as  
0ri =∑

n

 (7) 
For a one-DOF, n-link, planar linkage, the number of the 
independent loops is (n/2-1) [21]. Writing Eq. (7) for each 
independent loop k yields a total number of (n/2-1) linearly 
independent vector equations with n link vectors. The number of 
linearly independent link vectors of the linkage is then obtained by 
subtracting the number of loop closure equations from that of link 
vectors as

(}{# +== n-nn-B  (8) 
where B is referred to the set of linearly independent link vectors 
or the base vectors of the linkage, and #{B} represents the number 
of the base vectors.  
A set of base vectors, or a basis, is a spanning set of a vector space, 
where all vectors in that space can be represented by the linear 
combination of the base vectors in the set. For example, if B={v1, 
v2, …, vn} is a basis of vector space V, any vector v∈V can be 
expressed uniquely by the linear combination of the basis B as v = 
β1v1+β2v2+…+βnvn where scalars β1, β2, …, βn are the coordinates 
of vector space V with respect to the basis B. 
  Solving the (n/2-1) loop closure equations simultaneously, any 
link vector ri of the linkage can be expressed by the linear 
combination of the base vectors as  
Bck ∈′=∑ k
k
ki rrr ,  (9) 
where rk represents a base vector and c'k is the constant coefficient 
obtained from the algebraic manipulations of the (n/2-1) loop 
closure equations of Eqs. (7).  
Substituting Eq. (9) into Eq. (4), the gravitational potential energy 
of a one-DOF, planar linkage can be written in terms of the 
(n/2+1) base vectors as

Although any (n/2+1) of the n independent vectors of the system 
can be chosen as the base vectors, practically, it is desirable to 
select ground vector r1 to be one of the base vectors. Since ground 
vector is configuration independent, vector r1 is referred as the 
invariant base vector, while the remaining (n/2) base vectors are 
referred as the variant base vectors. Hence, Eq. (10) can be further 
rewritten as

  Note that, referring to the ground-adjacent link in Fig. 3 and 
based on Eq. (19b), the installing angle of the spring can be 
represented by λj= αj-βj-θj. = - arg( c"j )-θj. This indicates that the 
spring installation angle λj varies as the ground-adjacent link 
rotates and, thus, the variation of the gravitational potential energy 
of the system at any configuration can be fully compensated by 
that of the elastic potential energy of the spring if the conditions in 
Eq. (19) are satisfied. Also note that, in addition to the geometry 
and mass properties of the linkage, the spring constant Kj in Eq. 
(19) depends on the magnitudes of both spring installation vectors 
aj and bj. In general, the value of spring constant Kj can be 
arbitrarily adjusted simply by tuning the attached ends of the 
spring to other corresponding position. For example, if a stiffer 
spring is desired, smaller magnitudes of vectors aj and bj have to 
be used. On the contrary, if a softer spring is used, larger 
magnitudes of vectors aj and bj are required. Therefore, if the 
gravitational potential energy of the linkage can be formulated by 
the expression of all ground-adjacent links, the entire gravitational 
potential energy of the system is fully decoupled and can be 
balanced by the elastic potential energy of the spring fitted on each 
of the ground-attached links. Since no auxiliary parallel links are 
used for the static balance of a linkage, such a design is considered 
efficient and less complex. 
 
 
5  Feasible linkages and associated spring installation 
configuration 
 
 5.1  General spring balancing linkages 
 
  A one-DOF, n-link, planar linkage with (n/2) ground-adjacent 
links can be perfectly balanced by attaching a spring to each of the 
ground-adjacent links. By the use of the graph representation [22], 
ten feasible springs balancing four-, six- and eight-link graphs are 
obtained as illustrated in Table 1, where links are represented by 
vertices, joints by edges, ground link by double vertices, and 
springs by double slash lines. A double slash line represents that a 
spring is fitted between the ground vertex and its adjacent vertex. 
The linkages in Table 1 are referred to the SBMs of type A where 
the numbers of the ground-adjacent links and the variant base 
vectors are both equal to (n/2). Note that, the number and the 
lowercase alphabetic letters represent the number of links and 
distinct graph structures, respectively. For instance, graphs “A6a” 
and ”A6b” are both six-link, type-A SBMs with different 
structures. 
 
 5.2  SBMs with degenerated number of springs 
 
  Should less ground-attached springs are desired for the static 
balance of a one-DOF, n-link, planar linkage with (n/2) ground 
adjacent links, the number of the variant base vectors must be less 
than (n/2). This can be achieved by imposing  
Table 1  Graph representations of one-DOF general SBMs

additional kinematic constraints into the system. Provided one 
parallel constraint is given as that of Eq. (6). Combining the 
kinematic constraint of Eq. (6) with the loop closure equations of 
Eq. (7) yields a total number of (n/2) linearly independent 
equations with n vectors. The number of vectors in the basis 
becomes  
2
)
2
(}{# nnn-B ==     (21) 
Comparing Eq. (21) with Eq. (8), the number of base vectors in 
Eq. (21) is one less than that of Eq. (8) and the required number of 
the ground-attached springs can be reduced by one. In the search 
of the admissible SBMs with parallel motion constraints, three 
rules are employed: first, any two adjacent links can not be 
assigned as parallel motion pairs, otherwise they are considered 
rigidly connected and result in the degeneration of numbers of 
links, joints and the degrees of freedom of the linkage; second, all 
kinematic isomorphic structures due to the parallel constraints are 
excluded; and third, since the base vectors must be linearly 
independent to each other, only one of the parallel-motion vertices 
can be fitted with one ground-attached spring. As a result, the 
graphs of the admissible SBMs with parallel motion constraints 
are obtained and enumerated in Table 2, where the solid vertices 
represent the pair of links in parallel motion. The linkages with 
degenerated number of springs in Table 2 are referred to the SBMs

the term g．(c"1 r1 ) in Eq. (26) is constant and irrelevant to the 
spring design conditions, it is not expressed explicitly. By fitting a 
ground-attached springs between ground and links 2, 4 and 6, 
respectively, as shown in Fig. 4, the balance of the total potential 
energy of the system can be accomplished and the spring constants 
and the spring attachment points for each of the ground-attached 
springs can be determined based on Eq. (19) as

according to Eq. (28). Consider a linkage with given geometry           
and mass properties provided in Table 4 where the initial 
configuration of the linkage represented by vectors rj and sj for 
j=1, 2, …,6 are also included. With pre-determined values of 
spring constants K2=1000 N/m, K4=3000 N/m and K6=5000 N/m, 
the spring attachment points of the three springs are readily 
obtained via Eq. (19) and listed in Table 5. Similarly, the design of 
a spring balancing Watt-II linkage can be implemented using this 
methodology applicable to the design of the Stephenson-III type 
linkage. 
 
6.2  Example II: Spring balancing parallelogram 
four-bar linkage 
 
  The four-bar parallelogram of graph B4 in Table 2 is the 
simplest structure of a parallel linkage. As shown in Fig. 5, due to 
its special geometry, links 2 and 4 are always parallel to each other 
and the kinematic relation between links 2 and 4 is  
24 rr −=      (29) 
The coupler link 3 is in circular translation and its orientation is 
parallel with respect to ground. According to Eq. (11), the 
gravitational potential energy of the parallelogram four-bar 
linkage is

one-DOF, n-link, planar parallel linkage with (n/2-1) ground-adjacent 
link can be accomplished by using degenerated number of springs.  
  The motions of the Stephenson-III type six-bar linkage of Fig. 4, the 
parallelogram four-bar linkage of Fig. 5 and the Watt-I type six-bar 
linkage of Fig. 6 are simulated by ADAMS and the gravitational, elastic 
and total potential energies verse crank angle for an entire cycle are 
plotted in Figs. 7(a), 7(b) and 7(c), respectively. Figure 7 shows that the 
variations of the gravitational potential energies of both systems can be 
perfectly compensated by that of the elastic potential energies of the 
ground-attached springs. 
  In general, a Watt-I linkage with only two ground-adjacent links can 
not be statically balanced with ground-attached springs alone. However, 
due to the inclusion of the kinematic constraint of parallel motion, the 
number of the base vectors required in the formulation of the 
gravitational potential energy of the Watt-I linkage is degenerated by 
one. Hence, only two ground-attached springs are needed. The concept 
of degeneration of the linearly independent vectors in the formulation of 
the gravitational potential energy of the planar linkage can be extended 
to linkages of higher links. With the aid of graph representations, more 
feasible higher-link SBMs can be enumerated systematically. In practice, 
static balance of a one-DOF, n-link planar linkage with less than (n/2) 
ground-adjacent links can be obtained, as long as the kinematic 
constraint equations are linearly independent to the existed loop closure 
equations.

7  Conclusions 
 
  A systematic methodology for the design of a full-cycle, statically 
balanced, one-DOF planar linkage with revolute joints only is presented. 
In the methodology, no auxiliary parallel links are required. Design of a 
statically balanced, one-DOF, n-link, planar linkage with (n/2) 
ground-adjacent links can be accomplished by fitting a ground-attached 
spring to each of the ground-adjacent links. Admissible graphs of 
one-DOF planar linkages of up to eight links are enumerated. It is also 
shown that the SBMs with degenerated number of the springs can be 
obtained, provided that the prescribed kinematic constraints of the 
linkage are linearly independent to the inherited loop closure equations. 
This methodology is successfully demonstrated by the designs of the 
static balances of a general Stephenson-III type six-bar linkage with (n/2) 
ground-adjacent links and a Watt-I type six-bar linkage of parallel 
motion with (n/2-1) ground-adjacent links. Results are simulated and 
justified by the software ADAMS.

Schenk, J. Herder, Netherlands）更是本次 Mech 的 best paper award 得主，
其內容所使用的概念相當簡單，所解決問題的本質與我的研究十分雷同，在現今
講求能源環保的時代，彈簧平衡機構以節能的訴求似乎在學術再度引起熱潮，他
另外 4 篇的論文有些將彈簧平衡的設計應用於撓性機構，應用於微手術夾的力平
衡也相當有趣（”Concept and Modeling of a Statically Balanced Compliant 
Laparoscopic Grasper,”N. Tolou, J. Herder, Netherlands），這次參與研討
會真的是受益良多，回國後啟發了我不少研究上的靈感。由於我的研究有另一個
部份是應用彈簧平衡方法設計上肢復健機械手臂，所以，我也去聆聽了一些相關
的題目（”An Elastic Exoskeleton for Assisting Human Running,”M. Cherry, 
D. Ferris, S. Kota, United States.;”Optimization and Design of a Cable 
Driven Upper Arm Exoskeleton,”S. Agrawal, J. Gangloff, E. Brackbill, V. 
Sangwan;等）。會議期間，也有遇到其他台灣的教授，成大黃金沺老師的報告題目
（7 桿 Bennet linkage）也很有趣。很遺憾，這次聽說是因為開會地點的因素，
出席的人並沒有如去年踴躍，Prof. Gosselin 的論文也都缺席了。 
 
三、建議 
  聖地牙哥市靠海邊，風景優美，由於經費有限，會議附近的旅館昂貴，在開會
期間我是住在對岸的旅館，一晚約 70 美金，在加上一天約 55 美金的租車費用，
其實過得有點拮据。還好旅館到會場開車算近，約 20 分鐘。會議結束後（9/3），
順道去 LA，從 LAX 回程聯合航空班機誤點，原定的在 9/7東京轉台北的飛機趕不
上，只好隔天坐東京->成田->台北，有點折磨人，所以如果有下次，盡量還是選
擇直飛的班機。

序幕，會中碰到台灣成功大學等國內大學來的學者與國外的研究生及年輕學者，與會人員
邊聊天邊吃點心，典型簡單型西式酒會模式。 
個人所發表之論文是發表於本系列會議中之34th Annual Mechanisms and 
Robotics Conference (MR)，此部分會議共有188 篇技術論文，個人論文於8/16(MON) 
PM4:00~5:30 做口頭報告，該時段的主持人為Hashem Ashrafiuon， 
來自美國賓州Villanova University，副主持人為Carl A. Nelson, 來自美國University of 
Nebraska。共有5篇技術論文報告，我是第四個上台作口頭報告，會議廳內大約有20 人左
右，報告過程自己顯然有點緊張過頭，但時間也有控制在15 分鐘左右。報告結束後Q & A
時僅有1 個人發問有關所研究的論文主要應用為運動或復健，於發問的當下即時給予適當
回覆。  
由於16日即完成論文口頭報告，17及18兩天得以輕鬆的心情，利用此難得的機會，
參加會議中讓我感興趣的領域與題目，當然，主要還是集中在機構與機器人(Mechanism 
and Robotics)領域，學習其他與會學者的研究內容、方法與結果，並同時觀摩其英文口頭
報告表達方式。 
二.  會議心得: 
這次參與國際研討會個人受益良多，雖非第一次參與國際學術研討會，但卻是第一
次上場進行口頭論文報告，當聽眾畢竟與當報告者在心理狀態上是有很大的差異。更讓我
深深體會到學術研究的無國界，為了達成有效交流，英文仍是相互溝通的主流語言。對於
非英語系國家的研究者，這是必備的基本能力。 
另外，藉由會議的舉辦，讓與會者得以在短短數天的研討會中，快速掌握或了解相
關領域的研究走向與重點，並一次蒐集到最新研究文獻資料，聽取領域內頂尖學者的演

ABSTRACT 
Over-automated equipments and modern city life style lead 
to the diminishing opportunities for muscle using; however, the 
comfortable life is not always good for human health, and 
appropriate muscle training can not only enhance muscular 
strength and endurance but improve the health and fitness. 
Different kinds of ideas have been proposed for muscle training 
by exercise machines, which control direction of resistance for 
safety sake but isolate specific muscle groups to be trained. 
Compared with machines, free-weight exercise is a whole-body 
training in which human limbs can be moved on different 
planes to train more muscle groups. In this study, an upper limb 
exoskeleton design is proposed for free-weight exercise to 
strengthen the principal muscles of upper limb and shoulder. 
The upper limb exoskeleton is constituted of 3-DOF shoulder 
joint and 1-DOF elbow joint. The joint torques of shoulder and 
elbow joint of the exoskeleton match the objective joint torques 
from a model of free-weight exercise. The principal muscles of 
human arm and shoulder are training by dumbbell lateral raise, 
dumbbell frontal raise, dumbbell curl motion, and overhead 
triceps extension motion. With the arrangement of small-inertia 
springs, the exoskeleton is capable of preventing the muscle 
from injuries caused by the huge inertia change. The evaluation 
of the model was conducted by using isokinetic dynamometer 
to measure shoulder abduction-adduction, shoulder flexion-
extension, and elbow flexion-extension for the male and female 
adults, and the results matched with the data obtained from the 
derived model.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Hisamoto, S. and Higuchi, M. (2007) have displayed a 
report that young people in Japan have less muscle strength 
than older people based on measuring about 1000 healthy 
people’s joint torques [1]. The reason is that more over-
automated equipments in the recent daily life reduce the 
opportunities for muscle using. However, the comfortable life is 
not always good for human health; appropriate muscle training 
can not only enhance muscular strength and endurance but 
improve the health and fitness, e.g., reinforcing 
cardiopulmonary function, reducing body fat, and improving 
bone mineral density and physical function, etc. [2]. Among 
muscle trainings, resistance exercise has been widely adopted 
to help patients recover normal physiological functions in 
impairing motor activity, improving dynamic stability, etc [3, 
4]. The forms of resistance exercise can be classified into static 
resistance exercise (isometric exercise) and dynamic resistance 
exercise (isokinetic exercise and isotonic exercise) [5].  
Isometric exercise is a training in which muscles can be 
contracted without moving joints. This exercise is to make 
muscle fibers in a state of isometric contraction where muscles 
generate force without changing length. The exercise is 
performed beyond the maximum strength of an individual when 
one tries to resist an immovable object. Most studies have been 
indicated isometric exercise is superior to isokinetic exercise 
and isotonic exercise in muscle strength gains. Knapik, J. J., et. 
al (1983) have demonstrated isometric exercise allows training 
at a maximum output torque [6], and Kuhlman, J. R., et. al 
(1992) have indicated isometric peak torque is greater than 
isokinetic peak torque [7]. However, isometric exercise does 
not improve motor performance ability; the recovery of 
muscles’ dynamic functions must be through dynamic 
resistance exercise [5]. Isokinetic exercise is a training in which 
muscle contracts at a constant angular velocity of joint [5]. 
Thistle, H. G. et. al (1967) have presented the isokinetic 
exercise by a precise control of velocity movement [8], Kikuchi,

the paper for the conciseness. 
  From Fig. 1, the origins of CSs 0, 1, and 2 are coincident at 
GH joint S whose corresponding di and ai are zeros. θ1, θ2, θ3 and 
θ4 represent the rotation angles of shoulder internal-external, 
shoulder abduction-adduction, shoulder flexion-extension, and 
elbow flexion-extension motions respectively. Where rSE is the 
segmental length of the upper arm measured from the shoulder 
pivot to the elbow pivot, and rEF is the segmental length of the 
forearm measured from the elbow pivot to the middle of palm. 
The D-H parameters are listed in Tab. 1. 
The inside portion of a human shoulder is called shoulder 
girdle, which is consisted of clavicle and scapular. The clavicle is 
connected to the trunk by sternoclavicular joint, and the 
glenohumeral (GH) joint connects scapular and humerus. The 
motion of shoulder girdle is enabled by the scapulothoracic, 
sternoclavicular and acromioclavicular joint. Klopčar, N. et. al. 
(2005) have indicated the girdle motion can be modeled as two 
degrees of freedom by using a universal joint and a dependent 
translation [20]. The motion of girdle is enabled by two 
parallelogram linkages and two serially connected links, and the 
assembly is shown in the posterior linkage in Fig. 1. The 
parallelogram linkages provide the girdle a superior-inferior 
motion vertically, and the two serially connected links allow the 
GH center to be free on a horizontal plane. 
The muscles on the shoulder are complicated; the deltoid 
muscles are the principal muscles on the shoulder. Deltoid 
muscles contain anterior deltoid, middle deltoid and posterior 
deltoid, encircling the shoulder joint and acting in most shoulder 
movements. Besides, there are rotator cuff act to stabilize the 
shoulders where the rotator cuff is a muscle group formed by 
suparaspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor and subscapularis 
muscle. In the back of a human, latissimus dorsi has functions to 
raise an arm, and there is pectoralis major muscle in the chest of a 
human body. There are biceps and triceps on the upper arm where 
the former contributes more when forearm is flexed, and the latter 
has contributions on the elbow extension. In free-weight 
exercises, dumbbell exercises are commonly used to train the 
muscles of shoulder and upper arm. According to degrees of 
freedom of shoulder in this study, dumbbell bench fly, dumbbell 
lateral and frontal raise motions are corresponding to shoulder 
internal-external, abduction-adduction, and flexion-extension 
motion, respectively. The dumbbell bench fly is an exercise for 
strengthening the pectoralis major muscles, while anterior deltoid 
and biceps provide synergy during the exercise. The lateral raise 
motion can strengthen the muscles of deltoid, suparaspinatus, 
latissimus dorsi and pectoralis major. The frontal raise motion is a 
training mainly about the muscles of coracobrachialis, deltoid 
muscle, pectoralis major, and latissimus dorsi. There is

dumbbell curl motion around the axis of elbow flexion-extension 
which principally trains biceps as well as brachialis and 
brachioradialis. The triceps brachii is an extensor muscle group 
which works in the extension movements of upper limb, (i.e., 
shoulder abduction, shoulder extension, and elbow extension) but 
its contributions are not significant. For major training triceps, an 
overhead triceps extension is achieved by rotating the forearm 
about axis of elbow flexion-extension [21, 22]. 
 
 
2. JOINT TORQUES OF FREE-WEIGHT EXERCISE 
Free-weight exercise is a muscular exercise by using external 
weights as resistant force on a freely moving body, and then the 
muscle force would be strengthened by increasing the 
free-weights load gradually. In Fig. 1, an objective model is 
constructed for dumbbell exercise where an external load mw is 
grasped in the middle of palm F, and the segmental masses of 
upper arm and forearm, mu and mf, are located on the mass centers 
of upper arm and forearm, respectively. The mass of a human 
hand can be ignored here because it is relatively light compared 
to the upper limb. During exercising, the gravitational potential 
energy of the kinematic model can be expressed as

4.2 Spring Design Conditions for Pinpointed Muscular 
Exercise  
  According to 3 DOF of shoulder, there are dumbbell bench 
fly, dumbbell lateral and frontal raise motions about axes of 
shoulder internal-external, abduction-adduction and 
flexion-extension, respectively. In free-weight exercise, 
dumbbell bench fly is a kind of exercise in which user lies on a 
bench, and gravity acts on the direction of negative y0 of CS 0 to 
provide torques on the shoulder joint about axis of shoulder 
internal-external motion. However, in this study, only the stand 
posture is concerned in that when the gravity acts on the direction 
of negative ko of CS 0, the torque of shoulder internal-external is 
zero. Therefore, only dumbbell lateral and frontal raise motions 
about shoulder abduction-adduction and flexion-extension 
motion for shoulder joint in the upper limb exoskeleton have 
been taken into account. Both the two types of dumbbell exercise 
are able to strengthen deltoid muscle. In elbow flexion-extension 
motion, there are dumbbell curl motion and overhead triceps 
extension for principal training biceps and triceps, respectively. 
 
 
4.2.1  Deltoid Muscle Training from Shoulder 
Abduction/Adduction. For shoulder abduction-adduction, 
lateral raise motion is used for strengthening deltoid muscle 
principally. In free-weight exercise, the prepared posture of a user 
is upper limb holding the dumbbell at sides of trunk. Then the 
user’s stretching upper limb raises the dumbbell out to sides and 
keeps the motion on the frontal plane. When the upper limb is 
parallel to floor, the user returns to the prepared posture and 
repeats. In the kinematic model, the angles of θ3 and θ4 are fixed 
on 0 degree, and the upper arm and forearm can be considered as 
one link and the rotating is about axis z1 with θ2 only. Substituting 
the angles θ3 and θ4 into Eqns. (11)-(13) yields the joint torques of 
θ3 and θ4 are zero, and then the joint torque of θ2 can be expressed 
as

In shoulder abduction-adduction motion with upper limb 
exoskeleton, the upper limb maintains the same posture as lateral 
raise motion with exoskeleton; however, the resistance from 
dumbbells is replaced by springs. Substituting the same angles as 
lateral raise motion, θ3 and θ4, into Eqns. (22)-(24), the joint 
torques of shoulder with exoskeleton are obtained in which the 
joint torques of θ3 and θ4 are zero, same as lateral raise motion, 
and the joint torque of θ2 is shown as

  For emulating free-weight exercise, the joint torques in 
lateral raise motion and upper limb exoskeleton have to be equal 
to each other. As a result, the coefficients of sθ2 and cθ2 in Eqns. 
(25) and (26) must be equal to each other. The design condition of 
spring K1 obtained from the equation of coefficients of cθ2 is 
expressed as

plane paralleling mid sagittal plane. In the kinematic model, the 
angles of θ2 and θ3 are fixed on 90 and 180 degrees respectively, 
and the forearm rotates about axis z3 with θ4. Substituting the 
angles of θ2 and θ3 into the Eqns. (11)-(13) and (22)-(24), and the 
momentums of free-weight exercise have to be same as the upper 
limb exoskeleton. Therefore, the design condition of spring K2 
and K3, same as the elbow flexion-extension exercise for training 
biceps, are shown as Eqns. (41)-(43). In elbow flexion-extension 
exercise for training biceps and triceps, the installation of spring 
K1 can be set on any position for it will not affect the results of 
muscle strengthening. 
 
 
 
 
5 EVALUATION OF THE UPPER LIMB EXOSKELETON 
5.1 Anthropometric Parameters of the Upper Limb 
Detailed design of the upper limb exoskeleton depends on 
the anthropometric parameters associated with the user’s upper 
limb. The link length rSE and rEF of the upper arm and the forearm 
can be measured via access to many database of anthropometry in 
the world. According to the anthropometry resource from NASA, 
the research of Clauser et. al., and the institute of occupational 
safety & health in Taiwan [23-25], 
the link length of upper arm and forearm for the small, the mid, 
and the large sized human beings are listed in Tab. 2. 
The upper limb exoskeleton for muscular exercises is 
designed by four links and four zero-free-length springs in which 
the springs provide not only resistant force for exercise but 
balance of the weight of links. Also, the masses of links would 
generate the shoulder and elbow joint torques. Hence, it is 
important to consider the mass properties of each link when 
designing the spring adjustable points location. The masses and 
corresponding coordinates of the mass centers of each link are 
listed in Tab. 3. 
For detailed designing the spring attachments of the upper 
limb exoskeleton, interference among different links during 
exercise needs to be considered. For example, the attached point 
A3 of spring K3 and link 4 is in a prominent link on link 4 that 
exceeds elbow joint. In the upper limb stretching course, motion 
interference of link 4 and link 2 would happen if the length of 
prominent link is longer than upper arm. Therefore, lEA3 is 
designed as 150mm which is shorter than the length of upper arm. 
On the other hand, the length of attached point of spring K1 
together with link 1 lS’A1 is designed as 100mm. In muscular 
exercise, the upper limb exoskeleton increases the resistance by 
adjusting the length lSL, lSF, and lSC between attached points of 
springs K1, K2 or K3 and link 2, respectively. In this study, the 
maximum resistant force of the upper limb exoskeleton is 
designed on 7 kg, and the spring adjustable points are limited in 
the range of 40mm to 120mm for individuals. The spring K4 that 
connects the link 1 and 2 balances the weight of link 2, 3, and 4, 
while the adjustable length lS’B is limited in the range of 15mm to 
50mm. 
Substituting the limits of spring adjustable length, 40mm to 
120mm, the maximum resistance 7kg, and the mass properties of 
linkages along with anthropometric parameters of humans to Eqn. 
(27), the range of spring stiffness of K1 can be obtained as 
 N/mmK N/mm 027.6666.2 1 ≤≤  (44) 
Following the same steps, in shoulder flexion-extension exercise, 
the range of spring stiffness of K2 can be derived from Eqn. (37), 
and in elbow flexion-extension exercise, the range of spring 
stiffness of K3 are obtained from Eqn. (43). 
mmNKmmN / 627.1/ .5390 2 ≤≤  (45) 
mmNKmmN / 901.2/ .3231 3 ≤≤  (46) 
In practice, designing constant spring stiffness of these four 
zero-free-length springs are 5.449N/mm, 1.058N/mm, 
1.411N/mm and 0.774N/mm respectively. The spring design 
conditions of exoskeleton are functions of the lengths of upper 
arm and forearm and mass properties of links. Utilizing the 
values of rSE, rEF, K1, K2 , K3 and K4 along with the parameters of 
links given in Tab. 3, the range of spring adjustable points

can be immediately obtained from Eqns. (28)-(29), (35)-(38) and 
(42)-(44) and listing in Tab. 4. One thing should be noted that, in 
Tab. 4, the two values of an installing length separated by a slash 
correspond to the two resistant forces of 1 and 7 kg. Meanwhile, 
lS’B is fixed in either exercise with the value of 31.4 mm. In 
shoulder flexion-extension, the spring K3 provides the balance of 
the weight of link 3 and link 4, but the effect is rather small; 
therefore, lSC can be regarded as zero in this exercise. 
 In embodiment design of the device, the arrangement of 
three revolute joints for 3-DOF shoulder joint is illustrated in Fig. 
4(a). The revolute joints of axes z0 and z2 are achieved by thrust

motion. The period of both two shoulder exercise is 10 seconds. 
In elbow flexion-extension exercise, the movement of the 
forearm is driven by the elbow joint about axis z3, and the period 
of the motion is 15.6 seconds. The joint angle in θ4 ranges from 0 
degree to 150 degree on the first half period and changes back to 
0 degree. The plot of joint angles of each exercise versus time is 
shown in Fig. 5. 
Figures 6 show the values of shoulder and elbow joint torques 
of dumbbell exercise and the exoskeleton. The black solid line is 
the joint torque of shoulder abd-add, flx-ext, and elbow flx-ext 
exercise from the experiment of exercise with 4lb weight 
dumbbell. The red solid line is the joint torque of 4lb weight 
resistance from the upper limb exoskeleton simulated through 
ADAMS. The dash line represents the resistance is 8lb weight. 
 
 
5.3 Results and Discussion 
The angular velocity of simulation in ADAMS software is set 
constant, but in the experiment, the constant angular velocity is

另外，藉由會議的舉辦，讓與會者得以在短短數天的研討會中，快速掌握
或了解相關領域的研究走向與重點，並一次蒐集到最新研究文獻資料，聽取領域
內頂尖學者的演說，更可當面與研究者進行觀念溝通與意見交流。我想這也是國
際學術會議的主要目的之一。 
因此，出國參加大型的國際研討會不僅可以開闊自己的視野與人脈，更可
以看到來自世界各國學者的最新研究主題走向、對研究所提出的獨特見解、採用

velocity of joint [5]. Thistle, H. G. et. al (1967) have presented 
the isokinetic exercise by a precise control of velocity 
movement [8], Kikuchi, T. et. al. (2003) have developed an 
isokinetic exercise machine by using ER brake [9], and Garner 
B. A.(2007) has designed a four-bar linkage exercise machine 
with hydraulic resistance close to isokinetic exercise [10]. The 
exercise provides the muscles to exert a continual maximal 
force throughout the range of motion [5]. However, the 
complexity velocity control systems are difficult to maintain 
truly constant angular velocity and isokinetic dynamometers 
do not store potential energy to cause eccentric contraction 
during the return motion of limb [8]. Even though eccentric 
contraction is easy to result in muscle damage, the exercise 
which combines concentric and eccentric contraction can 
obtain greater gains in muscle strength [5]. Isotonic exercise is 
a training where the external resistance does not vary during 
the training process [5]. Isotonic exercise has both concentric 
and eccentric muscle contraction throughout the range of 
motion; moreover, isotonic exercise is superior to isokinetic 
exercise in gains of muscle strength [11]. Therefore, isotonic 
exercise was chosen to strengthen the muscle force in this 
study. The idea of using machines instead of free-weights to 
provide resistances is then developed. An example of 
machine-assisted exercise in the early years can be found in 
U.S. patents where an exercising chair has been designed by 
White, M. V. B.(1879), which strengthens the muscles of arm 
and chest through resisting the resistance of spring and weight 
of the exerciser [12]. Most of the machines in U.S. patents use 
weight stack as the source of resistance, e.g., U.S.4836535 
[13], U.S.5336148 [14], and U.S.6152864 [15], while there are 
some machines which use spring as the source of resistance, 
such as U.S.5613928 [16] and U.S.7060012 [17]. It requires 
less skills to control the weight stack than free weight exercise 
and reduces the possibilities of injury. However, most 
machines permit movements in a single plane to isolate 
specific muscle groups for training, but free-weight exercise 
allows human limbs with external weights moving on different 
planes to train more muscle groups [2, 18, 19].  
In this study, an upper limb exoskeleton design is 
proposed for free-weight exercise to strengthen the principal 
muscles of upper limb and shoulder. The upper limb 
exoskeleton is consisted of 3-DOF shoulder joint and 1-DOF 
elbow joint where the upper arm can perform the motions of 
internal-external, abduction-adduction, and flexion-extension, 
and the forearm is able to carry out flexion-extension motion. 
The joint torques of shoulder and elbow joint with the upper 
limb exoskeleton have to equal the objective joint torques 
obtained from a model of free-weight exercise. The principal 
muscles of human arm and shoulder are training by dumbbell 
lateral raise motion, dumbbell frontal raise motion, dumbbell 
curl motion, and overhead triceps extension. With the 
arrangement of small-inertia springs, the exoskeleton is 
capable of preventing the muscles from injuries caused by the 
huge inertia change. Also, the locations of springs need to be 
adjusted for higher intensity training. Moreover, the 
gravitational potential energy including upper limb and 
exoskeleton would remain constant unlike the situation in 
free-weight exercise that external weights have been increased 
to induce huge inertia in heavier muscle strengthening. Finally, 
in order to be used for different individuals, the link length of  
exoskeleton is adjustable. 
 
Figure 1  KINEMATIC MODEL AND COORDINATE 
SYSTEM OF RIGHT UPPER LIMB 
 
 
2. KINEMATIC MODEL OF UPPER LIMB 
An upper limb contains the upper arm and the forearm. 
The upper arm in Fig. 1 is from the glenohumeral (GH) joint S 
to the elbow joint E, and the forearm is from the elbow joint E 
to the middle of palm of hand F. The mass of a human hand is 
relatively small compared to the upper limb and the hand is 
usually at its neutral position in the upper arm movements so 
that the gravitational variation caused by the wrist motion is 
negligible. Hence, the upper limb can be modeled as a two-
link linkage where the positions of mass centers, Mu and Mf, 
are assumed to be fixed and located on the center lines of the 
upper arm and forearm respectively. The kinematic model is 
shown in the arm linkage in Fig. 1. The glenohumeral (GH) 
joint in human skeleton connecting scapular and humerus is 
modeled as a 3-DOF ball joint at point S. Kinematically, any 
Euler angle sequence of three orthogonal rotation axes can be 
used to model three pure rotations of the GH center point, e.g., 
the shoulder flexion-extension, abduction-adduction and 
internal-external rotation. The elbow joint is regarded as a 
revolute joint at point E, which provides the elbow flexion-
extension motion only. 
The Denavit-Hertenberg (D-H) parameters are often used 
for the kinematic modeling of the upper limb. Following 
Denavit and Hertenberg’s convention (1955) in Fig. 1, four 
Cartesian coordinate systems (CSs), CS 1, 2, 3, and 4, are 
attached to each link, and CS 0 is attached to ground. The 4×4 
D-H transformation matrix between links i and i-1 can be 
represented as

In muscular exercise, external weights provide moments 
about the pivot joint, but the direction of the torques is 
opposite to the movement. For maintaining the movements of 
the upper limb exercise, there is a tendency from the muscle to 
resist the opposite torques; therefore, whether the muscle 
exercises or not can be learned from the changes of joint 
torques. The partial derivatives of the gravitational potential 
energy with respective to the joint angle θi is used for the 
calculation of the amount of torques. The gravity torque τi on 
the joint i can be obtained as

  By definition, the moment arm is a distance from the 
pivot joint and perpendicular to the acted force. Since the 
gravitational force on the weighted objects always acts 
downward, the moment arm on the upper limb in free-weight 
exercise is always horizontal. During the exercise, rotating the 
upper arm would vary the moment arm, resulting in the 
change of joint torque. On the upper limb free-weight exercise, 
the gravitational potential energy is function of sθ2 , cθ3 and 
c(θ3+ θ4), Eqn.(10) suggests that τ1 is zero; τ2 , τ3 and τ4 vary 
with θ2 , θ3 and θ4, respectively. The gravity joint torques of 
the upper limb can be derived as

4 DESIGN A SPRING-LOADED EXOSKELETON 
4.1 Upper Limb Exoskeleton 
  An upper limb exoskeleton design with spring 
attachments is illustrated in Fig. 3. The arm linkage is 
constructed by four links where the 3-DOF shoulder joint is 
constituted by three revolute joint of axes z0, z1 and z2 which 
are arranged to be orthogonal to each other, and the fourth 
DOF on the flexion-extension motion of the forearm can be 
obtained with a revolute joint of axis z3. The design of a 4-
DOF kinematic chain, illustrated in Fig. 1, contains four links 
where the link 1 and posterior linkage are connected by a 
revolute joint of axis z0, and link 1 and link 2 are connected by 
the other revolute joint of the axis z1. In practices, the

Figure 3  A SPRING LOADED EXOSKELETON FOR

exoskeleton configuration in Fig. 1 has drawbacks in the 
azimuthal rotation limitation which results from the motion 
interference of link 1 and the back side of the human body as 
well as in difficulty to achieve the accordance of the joint axes 
z0, z1 and z2 to the human GH joint center. Hence, the design  
has been modified to avoid such drawbacks. The link 1 and 
posterior linkage are connected by a revolute joint of a new 
axis that parallels z0-axis, and the new axis of link 1 and link 2 
is paralleling z1-axis. Link 2 and 3 are connected by a revolute 
joint of axis z2; links 3 and 4 are attached to the upper arm and 
forearm respectively and then connected by a revolute joint of 
axis z3. Instead of the external weighted objects, the increase 
of resistant force on the upper limb exoskeleton is achieved by 
using the spring force. The spring would change the resistance 
by adjusting the connected locations of spring, but the weight 
of total exoskeleton remains the same. On the spring-loaded 
exoskeleton, spring K1 is attached to point A1 on link1 and 
point L on link 2; spring K2 is attached to point F on link 2 and 
point A2 on link 4; spring K3 is attached to point C on link 2 
and point A3 on link 4. Furthermore, all three springs are made 
of zero-free length springs. Corresponding to elastic potential 
energies, Vs,1, Vs,2, and Vs,3 of springs K1, K2, and K3 are 
derived as

4.2.2  Deltoid Muscle Training from Shoulder 
Flexion/Extension. For shoulder flexion-extension motion, 
frontal raise motion is greatly adopted for training deltoid 
muscles. The beginning of the motion is same as lateral raise 
motion, holding the dumbbell at sides of trunk, stretching the 
upper limb, raising the dumbbell directly in front of the user, 
and keeping the motion on a plane paralleling mid sagittal 
plane. When the user’s upper limb is horizontal, the user backs 
to the beginning. In the kinematic model, the angles of θ2 and 
θ4 are fixed on 90 and 0 degrees respectively, and the upper 
arm and forearm can be thought as one rigid body rotating 
about axis z2 with θ3 only. Substituting the angles of θ2 and θ4 
into the Eqns. (11)-(13) yields the joint torque of θ2 is zero, 
and the joint torques of θ3 and θ4 can be expressed as

In shoulder flexion-extension motion with upper limb

Substituting the same angles, θ2 and θ4, of frontal raise motion

are shown as

In shoulder flexion-extension motion, the momentum 
about the axis z1’ due to weights of upper limb exoskeleton’s 
links is same as the momentum in shoulder abduction-
adduction motion. Therefore, the design spring conditions of 
spring K1 is used and shown in Eqn. (28). For reaching the 
effects of frontal raise motion, the joint torques in upper limb 
exoskeleton must be the same as the joint torques in frontal 
raise motion. Consequently, the coefficients of sθ3 in Eqns. (29) 
and (30) must be equal to Eqns.(32) and (33). The design 
conditions of spring K2 and K3 are obtained as

In regarding to the shoulder flexion-extension motion for

4.2.3  Biceps and Triceps Training from Elbow 
Flexion/Extension. For elbow flexion-extension motion, 
dumbbell curl motion principal is a biceps strengthening in 
free-weight exercise. The beginning posture in this motion is 
holding the dumbbell at sides of a human trunk, rotating 
forearm about axis z3, and keeping the motion on a plane 
paralleling mid sagittal plane. In the kinematic model, the 
angles of θ2 and θ3 are fixed on 90 and 0 degrees respectively, 
and the forearm rotates about axis z3 with θ4. Substituting the 
angles of θ2 and θ3 into the Eqns. (11)-(13) yields the joint 
torque of θ2 as zero, while the joint torques of θ3 and θ4 are 
equalized and expresses as

In elbow flexion-extension motion with upper limb 
exoskeleton, the motions of upper arm and forearm are same 
as dumbbell curl motion. Substituting the angles, θ2 and θ3, on 
dumbbell curl motion into the Eqns. (22)-(24), the joint 
torques of elbow joint with upper limb exoskeleton are 
obtained. The joint torque of θ2 same as shoulder flexion-
extension motion is expressed as Eqn. (31), while the joint 
torques of θ3 and θ4 are shown as

The spring design condition of spring K3 is same as frontal 
raise motion and shown as Eqn. (28). The joint torques of θ3 
and θ4 in the upper limb exoskeleton have to be equal to 
dumbbell curl motion, and the coefficients of sθ4 in Eqn. (38) 
must equal Eqns. (39) and (40). The design conditions of 
spring K2 and K3 are obtained as

On dumbbell curl motion, the increase of resistance is 
through increasing the weight of external load, mw. The 
adjustment of spring K3, i.e., lSC, can be used to increase 
resistant force from Eqn. (43).  
For strengthening triceps, there is overhead triceps 
extension in free-weight exercise. In exercise with upper limb 
exoskeleton, the motion can be performed by elbow flexion-
extension as well. The beginning posture of overhead triceps 
extensions is holding upper limb with dumbbells at sides of 
ear, then rotating forearm to the back of the body about axis z3, 
and keeping the motion on a plane paralleling mid sagittal 
plane. In the kinematic model, the angles of θ2 and θ3 are fixed 
on 90 and 180 degrees respectively, and the forearm rotates 
about axis z3 with θ4. Substituting the angles of θ2 and θ3 into 
the Eqns. (11)-(13) and (22)-(24), and the momentums of free-
weight exercise have to be same as the upper limb exoskeleton. 
Therefore, the design condition of spring K2 and K3, same as 
the elbow flexion-extension exercise for training biceps, are 
shown as Eqns. (41)-(43). In elbow flexion-extension exercise 
for training biceps and triceps, the installation of spring K1 can 
be set on any position for it will not affect the results of 
muscle strengthening.

5.2 Muscular Exercises 
  A series of experiments are conducted to measure the 
joint torques of shoulder abd-add, flx-ext, and elbow flx-ext 
exercise. In this study, the joint torques of dumbbell exercise 
are carried out by two healthy subjects (male and female), the 
total body weight (TBW) of the male and female subjects are 
70 kg and 55 kg, respectively. The length of upper arm and 
forearm of the male are 275mm and 320mm, and the female 
240mm and 270mm. In experiments of shoulder abd-add, 
shoulder flx-ext and elbow flx-ext exercises, the resistant force 
are 4lb and 8lb weight dumbbells, and the experimental

torques are regarded as the objective joint torques of the 
design. According to the anthropometric parameters of upper 
limb of the two subjects and the parameters of links given in 
Tab. 3, the design spring conditions of the upper arm 
exoskeleton can be obtained as Tab. 4, while the exact values 
of lS’L, lSF, lSC for 4lb (1.8kg) and 8lb (3.6kg) weight 
resistances are listed in Tab. 5. Utilizing these parameters to 
build a kinematic model of the upper limb along with the 
design in the computer simulation software ADAMS helps to 
simulate the demonstration of the achievement of this design. 
Based on the experiments of three types of exercise, the 
upper limb moves from the initial configuration where the 
upper arm and forearm is in vertical position, and ends in the 
same position. The measurements of joint torques are achieved 
by Biodex III isokinetic dynamometer. The Biodex System III 
isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, 
New York, USA) [26, 27] is an isokinetic dynamometer with 
an electrically controlled servomechanism commonly used in 
clinical and research settings. For shoulder abduction-
adduction exercise, the movement of the upper limb is driven 
by shoulder joint about axis z1; the joint angle in θ2 ranges 
from 90 degree to 180 degree, and then reverses the motion 
from 180 degree to 90 degree to complete the whole motion. 
The movement of the upper limb for shoulder flexion-
extension exercise is driven by shoulder joint about axis z2; the 
joint angle in θ3 ranges from 0 degree to 90 degree and then 
returns back to the beginning position of the motion. The 
period of both two shoulder exercise is 10 seconds. In elbow 
flexion-extension exercise, the movement of the forearm is 
driven by the elbow joint about axis z3, and the period of the 
motion is 15.6 seconds. The joint angle in θ4 ranges from 0 
degree to 150 degree on the first half period and changes back 
to 0 degree. The plot of joint angles of each exercise versus 
time is shown in Fig. 5. 
Figures 6 show the values of shoulder and elbow joint 
torques of dumbbell exercise and the exoskeleton. The black 
solid line is the joint torque of shoulder abd-add, flx-ext, and 
elbow flx-ext exercise from the experiment of exercise with 
4lb weight dumbbell. The red solid line is the joint torque of 
4lb weight resistance from the upper limb exoskeleton 
simulated through ADAMS. The dash line represents the 
r e s i s t a n c e  i s  8 l b  w e i g h t . 
 
 
5.3 Results and Discussion 
The angular velocity of simulation in ADAMS software is 
set constant, but in the experiment, the constant angular 
velocity is difficult to maintain and might cause the position of  
peak moments to slightly deflect. This state is obvious in 
elbow flexion-extension motion. In Fig. 6(a) and Fig.6(b), for 
the shoulder abduction-adduction exercise, the average

limb and shoulder is presented. The resistant force is provided 
by spring elements through the adjustment of the spring 
attachment points to increase the intensity of muscular 
exercise. The upper limb exoskeleton can perform shoulder 
abduction-adduction, flexion-extension, and elbow flexion-
extension exercise, and the joint torques of shoulder and 
elbow with the exoskeleton have to be equal to the objective 
joint torques obtained from a model of free-weight exercise.  
Free-weight exercise model can strengthen principal 
muscles of upper limb and shoulder by dumbbell lateral raise, 
dumbbell frontal raise, dumbbell curl motion and overhead 
triceps extension. According to anthropometric parameters, 
this study provides the spring design conditions of three 
exercise for the small, the mid, and the large sized human 
beings. The comparisons with the measurements of joint 
torques by Biodex III for a male and a female adult and 
ADAMS prove that the design matches with the objective 
free-weight exercise model. With the arrangement of small-
inertia springs, the design is capable of preventing the muscles 
from injuries caused by the huge inertia change.  
Detailed design of the upper limb exoskeleton is 
undergoing, a prototype will be built for further evaluations 
once the detailed design refinement is completed and fully 
reviewed.
