Polyamide 4,6 nanocomposites with and without the use of a maleated polyolefin 
elastomer as a toughener 
Abstract 
In this study, polyamide 4,6 (PA 4,6)-based nanocomposites were successfully prepared using 
a twin screw extruder. A commercial organo-montmorillonite (denoted as 30B) and a 
commercial maleated polyolefin elastomer (denoted as POEMA) served as the reinforcing filler 
and toughener, respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy 
(TEM) results confirmed the nano-scaled dispersion of 30B in the composites. Nevertheless, the 
presence of POEMA slightly depreciated the dispersibility of 30B. Polarized light microscope 
(PLM) observations showed that the inclusions of 30B and POEMA led to the formation of 
diffused/broken PA 4,6 spherulites. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results indicated 
that the addition of 30B retarded the crystallization of PA 4,6; the addition of POEMA led to a 
similar retardation effect on PA 4,6 crystallization. Interesting melting behaviors associated 
mainly with the crystal annealing of PA 4,6 upon heating were observed for the fast-cooled 
samples. The presence of POEMA was noted to hamper the annealing process of PA 4,6 crystals. 
The thermal stability enhancement of PA 4,6 in the presence of 30B was further raised to a 
higher extent when POEMA was included in the matrix. The rigidity, including the 
storage/Young’s/flexural moduli, of PA 4,6 significantly increased after adding 30B. These 
properties, however, declined after the additional incorporation of POEMA. The PA 
4,6/POEMA/30B nanocomposites basically displayed balanced impact strength between those 
of the neat PA 4,6 and PA 4,6/POEMA blends.

its crystallization/melting behavior and thermal stability, as well as those of the fabricated 
blends/nanocomposites are also compared.  
                                             
2. Experimental  
 
The PA 4,6 (trade name: Stanyl®
All blends/composites were prepared through a melt-mixing procedure using an 
intermeshing twin-screw extruder (SHJ-20B, L/D = 40) in the co-rotating mode. The screw 
speed was maintained at 400 rpm. The barrel temperatures were kept at 230 ~ 300
) used in this study is a commercial product of DSM. Its 
weight average molecular weight was ca. 40,000 g/mol, and its polydispersity was 2.22. A 
commercial O-MMT (Cloisite® 30B, denoted as 30B), obtained from Southern Clay Products, 
Inc., was used as the nano-filler for the fabrication of composites. The organic modifier for 
30B was a methyl tallow bis-2-hydroxyethyl quaternary ammonium ion. The tallow 
composition was ca. 65% C18, 30% C16, and 5% C14. A maleic anhydride-grafted polyolefin 
elastomer (denoted as POEMA) with ca. 0.5 wt.% of maleic anhydride (MA) was used as a 
toughener for the prepared PA 4,6/30B composites. The POEMA (Fusabond N MN493D, 
DuPont Co.) possessed a melt flow index of 1.6 g/10 min at 190oC and 2.16 kg load.  
oC from 
hopper to die. Before melt-mixing, the ingredients were dried at 85o
X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were 
employed to assess the dispersibility of 30B in the composites. The crystal form of PA 
4,6-based samples was also determined by XRD. A Siemens D5005 X-ray unit operating at 40 
kV and 40 mA was used to carry out the XRD experiments at room temperature. The X-ray 
source was CuK
C for 24 h in an 
air-circulated oven to remove any absorbed water. The 30B content of the composites was kept 
at 5 wt.%. The POEMA was loaded at concentrations of 10 and 15 wt.% when needed. Upon 
mixing, the ingredients were weighed at a certain ratio and then dry-mixed as one before 
feeding into the extruder. After mixing, the extruded samples were pelletized and then 
oven-dried before further characterization. For comparison, neat PA 4,6 was also 
melt-extruded under the same conditions. The formulations and sample codes for the 
fabricated blends/composites are listed in Table 1.  
α
An Olympus BX-50 polarized light microscope (PLM) in conjunction with a Linkam THMS 
600 hot stage were employed for the crystalline morphology observations of the samples. The 
thin-film specimens were prepared by first melting the samples and then compressing them 
 radiation with a wavelength of 1.54 Ǻ. The TEM observations were 
performed on ultra-thin sections of cryo-microtomed composite films with a JEOL 
JEM-2000EX II system using an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. To examine the dispersed 
POEMA phase in the blends/composites, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) experiments 
were performed on cryo-fractured surfaces of the samples using a Hitachi S-3000N system. The 
samples were immersed in liquid nitrogen before fracturing.  
 5 
 
diffraction was observed in the corresponding XRD pattern. Figures 2(b) and 2(c) illustrate the 
dispersion status of 30B in the two POEMA-included composites. The presence of POEMA 
slightly altered the 30B dispersibility in the composites. That is, larger amounts of 
multi-layered aggregates of 30B existed, although these aggregates were still distributed 
randomly in the polymeric matrix. This observation is consistent with the above XRD results 
showing that 30B had less affinity to the combination of PA 4,6 and POEMA than to PA 4,6 
alone. Nevertheless, the thicknesses of the 30B multi-layered aggregates were mostly less than 
100 nm. Based on the dispersibility observations for 30B, PA 4,6/30B nanocomposites can be 
developed regardless of the presence or absence of POEMA. 
 
3.2 Morphology 
SEM experiments were carried out to observe the phase morphology of POEMA-included 
samples. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) illustrate the SEM micrographs of the 90/10/0 and 85/15/0 
blends. For clear observation, the POEMA portion in the blends was etched out with p-xylene. 
A two-phased morphology, with the etched-out POEMA phase dispersed randomly in the PA 
4,6 matrix, was observed for the two blends. POEMA formed sphere-like domains, and the 
average size of the domains increased slightly with the increase in POEMA concentration. 
Figures 3(c) and 3(d) show the micrographs of the 85/10/5 and 80/15/5 nanocomposites. No 
evident 30B was visible within the two samples, confirming the fine dispersion of 30B. It is 
again noted that POEMA developed sphere-like domains. Nevertheless, compared with the 
images exhibited in Figures 3(a) and 3(b), the average POEMA domain size increased with the 
inclusion of 30B. This observation suggests that 30B negatively influenced the compatibility 
between PA 4,6 and POEMA. The variation, caused by the inclusion of 30B, in the rheological 
behavior for PA 4,6 and POEMA upon mixing should play an important role for this outcome.  
The PA 4,6 crystalline morphology of 10oC/min melt-crystallized samples was observed 
through PLM, as depicted in Figures 4(a–d) for representative samples. Typical spherulites 
with Maltese cross were grown in neat PA 4,6 (cf. Fig. 4(a)). The spherulites’ average size was 
larger than 50 µm. After the addition of 30B, the PA 4,6 spherulites became smaller and 
slightly broken, as shown in Figure 4(b). This morphology implies that dispersed 30B can 
present nucleation sites for PA 4,6 and also interfere with the growth of spherulites. For the 
blend with 15 wt.% POEMA inclusion (cf. Fig. 4(c)), the PA 4,6 spherulites became 
diffused/distorted and displayed more dark regions. POEMA is believed to be located within 
the spherulites to compose some of the dark regions. For the 80/15/5 nanocomposite (cf. Fig. 
4(d)), the nucleation site effect of 30B on PA 4,6 crystal growth became less evident. That is 
the spherulites’ average size was larger than that of 95/0/5 nanocomposite, but still smaller 
than that of neat PA 4,6. The spherulites exhibited diffused morphology, and the boundary 
between the spherulites became less distinct. Regarding 90/10/0 and 85/10/5 samples, they 
displayed similar PA 4,6 crystalline morphologies to those of 85/15/0 and 80/15/5 samples, 
respectively. Their PLM micrographs are thus not illustrated in Figure 4 for brevity.  
 7 
 
results suggest that the observed complex melting behaviors unlikely stemmed from different 
PA 4,6 polymorphs. Figure 9 illustrates the DSC heating thermograms of 80oC/min 
melt-crystallized samples under different heating rates. Some features are worth noting. First, 
the neat PA 4,6 and 95/0/5 showed multiple (partially overlapped) melting peaks, which were 
less evident than those of the POEMA-included samples under the same heating rates. Second, 
the intensity ratio between low-melting temperature (Tm,1) peak (peak 1) and high-melting 
temperature (Tm,2) peak (peak 2) increased with the decrease in heating rate for all the 
samples. Additionally, the evolution of the intensity ratio with the decreasing heating rate was 
more sensitive for the neat PA 4,6 and 95/0/5 than for those of POEMA-included samples. At 
the slowest heating rate (i.e., 5oC/min), neat PA 4,6 and 95/0/5 displayed only a simple melting 
peak 1. Third, the 5oC/min heating-rate led to the highest Tm,1 among the employed 
heating-rates for individual samples. The above features suggest that different degrees of 
crystals annealing must have occurred during the different heating-rate scans. The crystal 
annealing phenomenon, that is, peak 2-associated evolving to peak 1-associated, is mainly 
responsible for the occurrence of complex melting behaviors. To some extent, the presence of 
POEMA retarded the evolution of peak 1-associated PA 4,6 crystals during heating scans, thus 
facilitating the occurrence of multiple melting peaks. The 30B, on the other hand, had little 
influence on the melting behavior of PA 4,6. Peak 1-associated crystals are believed to be 
more stable than those of metastable peak 2-associated, given that a slower heating rate 
induced a relatively higher endothermic enthalpy for peak 1 and a higher value of Tm,1 (see 
Figs. 9(a) and 9(b)). The Tm,1 of 5
oC/min-heated neat PA 4,6 and 95/0/5 is around 288.3oC 
and 287.7oC, respectively. The values are close to the Tm,2’s of faster rates-heated 
corresponding samples. As recognized, due to the thermal lag effect, a faster heating rate 
results in a higher transition temperature during DSC scans. If the thermal lag effect of 
employing different heating rates on the observed data was taken into consideration, the Tm,1 
of 5oC/min-heated either sample would be higher than the Tm,2’s of faster rates-heated 
corresponding samples. This observation confirms again a higher stability of Tm,1
 
-associated 
crystals. As shown in Figure 7, a slower pre-cooling rate resulted in one melting peak (stable 
peak 1), whereas a faster pre-cooling rate resulted in two partially overlapped melting peaks 
(stable peak 1 plus less stable peak 2).  
3.4 Thermal stability 
The TGA-scanned results of selected samples under an air environment are shown in Figure 
10(a). Three observations can be made. First, POEMA exhibited the least thermal stability 
among the samples. Second, the thermal stability of neat PA 4,6 and 85/15/0 resembled each 
another, indicating the limited influence of POEMA on the thermal stability of PA 4,6. Third, 
the exclusive incorporation of 30B increased PA 4,6’s thermal stability; the further 
incorporation of POEMA slightly enhanced the thermal stability of the 95/0/5 nanocomposite. 
The corresponding derivative TGA (DTGA) curves of the samples are included in the inset of 
 9 
 
inhibited somehow the chain mobility of PA 4,6 during the heating process.      
The typical tensile and flexural properties of the samples were measured; the results are 
listed in Table 2. The addition of 30B increased the Young’s modulus (YM) and flexural 
modulus (FM) of PA 4,6 by more than 20% (cf. 95/0/5 nanocomposite). The elongation at 
break (EB) was inversely affected. With the exclusive inclusion of POEMA (cf. 90/10/0 and 
85/15/0 blends), the YM/FM of PA 4,6 in contrast declined, but the elongation at break 
increased, stemming again from the elastomeric nature of POEMA. For the two 85/10/5 and 
80/15/5 nanocomposites, their YM/FM fell between those of 95/0/5 and the two blends. The 
elongation at break was evidently lower than those of the neat PA 4,6 and the blends due to the 
existence of 30B. The impact test results of the samples are included in Table 2, which reveals 
that after adding 30B, the impact strength (IS) of PA 4,6 decreased by more than 60%, 
reaching a value of 7.2 J/m from the initial value of 20.8 J/m. Conversely, the incorporation of 
POEMA resulted in a significant increase in PA 4,6 impact strength (up to 69.3 J/m), 
indicating an apparent toughening effect. The reason for this remarkable enhancement is 
believed to be associated with the interactions between the MA portion of POEMA and the 
amide group of PA 4,6. For the nanocomposites with both 30B and POEMA inclusions, 
balanced impact strengths were observed. The impact strength was higher than that of neat PA 
4,6 if the POEMA content was 15 wt.%.   
 
4. Conclusions 
 
The dispersibility of an O-MMT (30B) within a PA 4,6 matrix in the absence or presence of 
a POEMA elastomer was evaluated. The phase morphology and thermal/mechanical properties 
of the samples were also determined. XRD and TEM results indicated that PA 4,6-based 
nanocomposites were achieved. The presence of POEMA slightly depreciated the 
dispersibility of 30B in the PA 4,6 matrix. The presence of 30B and/or POEMA did not change 
the crystalline polymorph of PA 4,6. The crystallization rate of PA 4,6 was inhibited as 30B 
and/or POEMA were added. The complex melting behaviors observed for the samples were 
attributed to the occurrence of PA 4,6 crystal annealing upon heating. The presence of POEMA 
could decline the extent of PA 4,6 crystal annealing. TGA data confirmed the thermal stability 
enhancement of PA 4,6 after adding 30B, and the additional inclusion of POEMA further 
increased the thermal stability. The storage modulus, Young’s modulus, and flexural modulus 
of PA 4,6 increased evidently with the sole inclusion of 30B. However, the addition of 
POEMA produced a decrease in these properties. The 30B and POEMA additions produced a 
reverse effect on PA 4,6 toughness. The PA 4,6/POEMA/30B nanocomposites presented 
balanced mechanical properties between those of the PA 4,6/30B nanocomposite and PA 
4,6/POEMA blends.

碳管分散情形 
PA 46/奈米碳管複合材料檢測 
圖 4 是將冷凍破斷後的樣品置於 FESEM 中觀察之結果，確認改質奈米碳管均分散
均勻(未改質奈米碳管分散狀態極差)，根據 SEM 的原理，電子束聚集越多的地方其在
SEM 觀察下越顯明亮，由於碳管屬於會導電的材料，故能使得電子聚集並反射較多的
二次電子，故推測酸化處理時數較少的奈米碳管，因為被覆蓋的高分子較少，其反射出
的二次電子會較多，在 FESEM 觀察便會顯得較為明亮。在比較兩種經歷不同改質時間
的奈米碳管(N3 和 N6)與 PA 46 所形成的複合材料時，即發現改質時間較短的奈米碳管
被拉曳出基材的部份越多，且在 FESEM 中顯得較為明亮，此結果證實隨著改質時間增
加，改質奈米碳管和 PA 46 基材間的親和力(相容性)會增加。

溫後所測得的XRD圖譜，圖中發現：純PA 46 在 2θ ≒ 23.2 (表示 ( 010/110 ) 晶面) 和 2θ 
≒ 20.7 (表示 ( 100 ) 晶面) 的位置處觀察到特徵繞射峰；當加入改質奈米碳管後，特徵
繞射峰強度均會稍稍減弱，此現象 可能是奈米碳管的加入影響了 PA 46 基材結晶度所造
成。且( 100 )繞射峰往高角度位移，( 010/110 )繞射峰往低角度的方向位移，代表著 ( 100 ) 
結晶面的間距稍微減短，但 ( 010/110 ) 結晶面的間距稍微增加，此現象與晶體內氫鍵之
方向與數量有直接之關係。接著利用Scherrer方程式計算PA 46 晶體中垂直 ( 100 ) 和 
( 010/110 ) 結晶平面之晶粒大小，發現加入改質奈米碳管後，在垂直( 100 )結晶面的晶
粒尺寸會隨著加入碳管的比例而增大，但是在垂直( 010/110 )結晶面之晶粒大小，會隨著
加入碳管比例增加而減小，但晶粒尺寸改變情形會隨著碳管含量增加而減緩。此觀察到
之現象，推估與碳管加入增加了 PA 46 的異質成核位置，造成晶核數變多，而與鄰近的
晶體互相干擾，導致 PA 46 晶粒尺寸改變；而異質成核的位置雖然隨著碳管含量增加而
變多，但是過多的碳管會使成核點達到飽和，使晶粒尺寸的變化減緩。此外，過多的碳
管亦會形成立體空間障礙，使得 PA 46 分子鏈的移動性降低，因此也抵銷了一些碳管異
質成核之效應。在比較同樣含量，不同改質時間的碳管與PA 46 形成複合材時，發現改
質時間較久的碳管其所引發的PA 46 晶粒尺寸較小，推測是由於碳管上羧酸等官能基團
能使 PA 46 的分子鏈易於規則排列，形成異質成核結晶，而隨著官能基含量的增加(改
質時間與碳管的羧化程度呈正向關係)，其氫鍵作用力越明顯，導致晶粒尺寸越小。

結 論 
1. FESEM、TEM、FTIR 以及 TGA 實驗結果顯示，利用混合酸液(硫酸和硝酸 = 3:1 (v/v))
進行多壁奈米碳管改質，確實能在碳管表面形成缺陷，使得奈米碳管結構變得不完
整，且隨著改質時間的增加，附著的羧酸官能基團越多。 
2. 利用 FESEM 觀察改質碳管於 PA 46 複合材料中分散情形，發現隨著碳管改質時間的
增加，PA 46 基材對於碳管的包覆性越好，碳管分散於 PA 46 基材中的情形也越均勻。 
3. 使用 XRD 分析樣品晶體結構，發現 PA 46 之( 010/110 )晶面間距隨著樣品冷卻速率
增快而變小。利用 Scherrer 方程式計算 PA 46 晶粒大小，( 010/110 ) 晶面之垂直方向
尺寸隨著奈米碳管的含量增加與碳管改質時間增加而下降。 
4. TGA 實驗結果顯示，不論於氮氣或空氣環境，加入改質奈米碳管均會提升 PA 46 的
熱穩定性。相同碳管含量時，改質時間較久之碳管對 PA 46 熱穩定性之提升較明顯。 
5. POM 實驗結果顯示，改質奈米碳管可作為 PA 46 之成核劑，但會使得 PA 46 之晶形
呈現不完整狀態。 
6. DSC 探討樣品結晶行為發現，加入改質奈米碳管對 PA 46 有明顯成核效應。於樣品
熔融行為的探討上證實，加入碳管使得 PA 46 之熔融峰往高溫偏移。

INTRODUCTION 
Due to the feasibility of their tailor-made properties, polymer 
blends continue to attract much attention both academically and 
industrially. Hence, investigations on various polymer blends have 
been conducted.[1] As it is known, the properties of the final blend 
product indeed depend on the miscibility between components. For 
crystalline polymer blends, their crystallization kinetics plays a major 
role on the resultant properties as well. Of all the crystalline blend 
systems investigated, studying the miscibility and physical properties 
of poly(L-lactide) (PLLA)-based blends has been among the major 
concerns.[2-11] PLLA is a well-known biodegradable and biocompatible 
thermoplastic. From an ecological viewpoint, the versatility of PLLA 
has to be enhanced. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) has served as a 
counterpart for modifying PLLA. Since both PLLA and PEG are able to 
crystallize, studies on the miscibility, crystallization kinetics, and phase 
morphology of PLLA/PEG blends are essential. Younes and Cohn[8] 
investigated the PLLA/PEG blends with various PEG molecular 
weights (MWs). Based on the melting temperature (Tm) depressions of 
both PLLA and PEG, they concluded that the blends indeed exhibit 
certain phase mixing features. The fact that the microphase separation 
occurred in the blends was generated by the crystallization(s) of the 
component(s). Nakafuku and his colleague[9,10] studied the 
crystallization, melting, and crystalline morphology of PLLA/PEG 
blends. Partial miscibility between PLLA and PEG molecules was 
indicated by the observation of composition-dependent Tg of PEG in 
the blends. For the blends with low MW PLLA(2000) and PEG(3000), 
the melt crystallization temperature (Tc) as well as Tm of both PLLA 
and PEG declined with decreasing individual content in the blends. Hu 
et al.[11] focused on the effect of cooling rate on the crystallization and 
subsequent aging of PLLA/PEG blends. It was observed that a slower 
cooling rate caused a higher extent of PLLA crystallization in the 
blends, and the PEG crystallinity was proportional to the PLLA 
crystallinity developed.  
With reference to the literature, it is basically recognized that 
PLLA/PEG blends exhibit miscibility in the amorphous state, and the 
crystallization/melting behavior of both components are influenced by 
the presence of its counterpart. Nevertheless, in our recent study of 
this blend system with different PEG MWs, we found that the 
miscibility of PLLA/PEG blends decreased evidently when a high MW 
PEG was used. In this paper, we report some thermal property results 
obtained from the study of PLLA/PEG blends with PLLA as the main 
component.  
 
EXPERIMENTAL 
PLLA (trade name Resomer® L-209S) was purchased from 
Boehringer Ingelheim. Its inherent viscosity is ca. 2.9 dl/g. PEGs with 
MWs of 1,500 g/mol (denoted 1.5k), 6,000 g/mol (denoted 6k), and 
2,000,000 g/mol (denoted 2M) were purchased from Arcos Organics, 
Janssen Chinica, and Aldrich Chemical, respectively. The PLLA/PEG 
blends with different compositions (based on weight percentage) were 
prepared using a solution mixing technique with chloroform as the 
solvent. The cast blends were exposed to a vacuum oven at room 
temperature for at least 24 hours before characterization. For 
comparative purposes, neat PLLA and PEGs were also chloroform 
treated. 
The crystallization and melting behaviors of the samples were 
measured using a TA DSC Q10 analyzer equipped with an inter-cooler. 
For the crystallization experiments, the samples were first melted at 
200oC for 2 min, and then cooled to -70oC at 20oC/min. The 
crystallized samples were subsequently heated to 200oC at 20oC/min 
for the melting behavior evaluation. The thermal stability of the 
samples was characterized using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) 
on a TA 2050 system under a nitrogen environment. The heating 
process was conducted from room temperature to 500oC at a rate of 
20oC/min. An Olympus light microscope in conjunction with a Linkam 
THMS 600 hot stage was employed for the samples’ melt-state 
morphology investigation. The thin-film specimens were prepared by 
first melting the samples at 200o
 
C, and then compressing them 
between glass slides.

Some interesting features were observed. First, the neat PLLA 
did not exhibit any crystallization exotherm during the 20oC/min cooling. 
Conversely, the three PEGs showed evident crystallization 
characteristics and their crystallization onset temperatures (Tos) 
shifted to higher temperatures with an increase in MW. The second 
observation was that the crystallization of PLLA was evident in the 
blends. This phenomenon indicates that the PEGs enhance the 
crystallizability of PLLA during the cooling process. However, the 
extent to which the PEG affects the PLLA’s crystallizability, in fact, 
depends on the MW and amount of PEG. The To of PLLA (denoted 
To,PLLA) in the three blend systems versus the PEG content is shown in 
Figure 2(a).  
 
 observed for the three blend systems are attributed to the different 
degrees of miscibility as anticipated. That is, a miscible blend system 
shows a higher degree of miscibility if the component’s MW is lower. A 
higher degree of miscibility leads to a higher extent of Tm depression. 
Regarding the Tm of PEG (Tm,PEG), it decreases as the PEG content 
decreases. Figure 3(b) depicts the value (denoted ∆Tm,PEG) of Tm,PEG 
in the blend subtracting Tm,PEG of neat PEG as a function of PEG 
content. Notably, the blend with a higher PEG MW exhibit a more 
negative ∆Tm,PEG value with the same PEG content. This result 
indicates that the PLLA/PEG(2M) blend system demonstrates the 
highest Tm,PEG depression, which is subsequently followed by the 
PLLA/PEG(6k) blend system. The PLLA/PEG(1.5k) blend system 
exhibits the least Tm,PEG depression. Thus, PLLA negatively affects the 
crystal stability (lamellar thickness) of PEG, especially for the PEG 
with a higher MW.  
The TGA results of the samples are shown in Figure 4(a-c).

Apparently, PLLA exhibits a lower thermal stability than that of either 
PEG. Some additional features are noted in this study. First, the 
blends show lower degradation onset temperatures (i.e., temperature 
at 5% weight loss) than those of parent components regardless of 
PEG’s MW. Second, the onset temperature basically shifts to a lower 
temperature as the PEG content increases from 10 wt.-% to 50 wt.-% 
for each of the blend systems, especially for the lower MW PEG-
included system. Third, each blend exhibits a two-stage degradation 
curve. Regarding the first feature, it reveals the fact that the blending 
of PLLA with PEG induces a damaging consequence on the samples’ 
thermal stability. The possible PLLA-PEG interchange reactions might 
play a key role in the results. The second feature further justifies such 
speculation. That is, if the contents of the two components are closer 
to one another (e.g., 50/50 blend), the interchange reactions could 
occur more easily. Moreover, the PEG with a lower MW causes the 
interchange reactions more easily (occurring at a lower temperature 
during the heating process). For the third feature, based on the wt.-% 
lost in each stage, the low-temperature degradation stage is mainly 
associated with the PLLA-portion, and the high-temperature 
degradation stage is associated with the PEG-portion. Since the low-
temperature degradation shifts evidently to a lower temperature as 
compared to that degradation of neat PLLA, it therefore suggests that 
the thermal stability of PLLA is more easily influenced by its PEG 
counterpart than the reverse.  
 
CONCLUSION 
The effect of PEG’s MW on the crystallization, melting, and 
thermal stability of PLLA/PEG blends with PLLA as a major 
component was revealed. PEG enhanced the crystallizability of PLLA 
during the cooling process. However, the crystallization efficiency of 
PEG depends on its MW as well as the blend composition. 
Unexpectedly, PEGs of low MW and high MW imparted opposite 
composition-dependent crystallization trend for PLLA. Moreover, the 
nucleation of PEGs in the blends was retarded by their PLLA 
counterpart. The Tms of both PLLA and PEG depressed in the blends. 
Nevertheless, PLLA and PEG exhibited different trends of PEG MW-
dependent Tm depression. The TGA data confirmed that the thermal 
stability of the blends was inferior to their parent components, 
especially for the blend system with lower PEG MW. The thermal 
degradation of PLLA component was more easily influenced by the 
incorporation of PEG than the reverse.
