reflecto-nulling antenna array which has two nulls occurring at the incident and
specular reflection directions without using digital signal processing techniques. At
the beginning of this chapter, a four-element reflecto-nulling antenna array is devel-
oped to verify the theory of operations of the nulling arrays described in Chapter
2. Then, by the folding method described in Chapter 2, a phase difference reversal
circuit developed in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 can have the phase difference between
two adjacent ports of the phase difference reversal circuit be reversed as −∆φi if the
phase difference of the input ports is ∆φi. Thus, the retro- and reflecto-nulling array
circuits can be implemented by the array circuits developed in Chapter 2 and Chap-
ter 3 to achieve retro-nulling characteristics and by properly using the phase shifters
to achieve reflecto-nulling characteristics. This approach is implemented by a passive
circuit with the use of 90◦ hybrids and phase shifters which are properly connected
to the transmitting and receiving antennas. The array then has the retransmitted
radiation pattern giving two nulls at the incident direction θi and specular direc-
tion −θi as the incident wave angle is at θi. The formulas and a folding method
on designing linear retro- and reflecto-nulling array circuits are presented with the
measurement results of three-element, four-element, five-element, and six-element
retro- and reflecto-nulling antenna arrays operated at 2.9 GHz.

Thus, retro-directive antenna arrays have the potential for the applications which
need to find the direction of the received signals and communicate with it.
This report presents a novel approach to implement retro-directive array circuits
by using 90◦ hybrids. By this approach, one can design a retro-directive antenna
array with arbitrary number of antenna element on a planar circuit. Furthermore,
a folding method which is developed to design linear retro-directive antenna arrays
by properly making use of 90◦ hybrids can be modified to design a novel array sys-
tem which is called “retro- and reflecto-nulling antenna array”. In a retro-directive
antenna array, if the phase difference of received signals between two adjacent an-
tenna elements is ∆φi, the phase difference of retransmitted signals is reversed as
∆φo = −∆φi. Therefore the design requirement for the retro-directive array circuit
is to properly implement the retro-directive array circuit to have phase difference
reversal characteristics for the retransmitted signals. In other words, the devel-
oped folding method can design a hybrid circuit to have phase difference reversal
characteristics which can make the phase difference of retransmitted signals become
−∆φi. Thus, the developed folding methods can be utilized to implement retro- and
reflecto-nulling antenna arrays which can yield two nulls at the reflection angle and
the incident angle of the incident wave without using any digital signal processing
techniques.
1.2 Literature Review
Because retro-directive antenna arrays have an attractive characteristic that they
do not need any a priori knowledge of the incident angle and do not need any dig-
ital signal processing techniques, a considerable number of studies have been made
on retro-directive antenna arrays. There are two major approaches to implement
the retro-directive array circuit. One is the Van Atta array structure [22] in which
transmission lines of equal length are used to connect two antenna elements that

phase conjugation performed at the lower sideband signal of the mixing. Because
this method is to conjugate the phase of the received signal, this approach can be
used to design conformal retro-directive array [38]. However, because the frequency
of the input signal and output signal are the same, it is important to suppress the
signal which leaks directly from the RF port of the mixer to the IF port of the mixer.
Since the signals which leak directly from the RF port are not phase-conjugated,
they are retransmitted in the direction that follows Snell’s law of reflection. There-
fore, there are several phase-conjugating circuits developed to improve the isolation
between the RF and IF ports of the mixer by using slightly different frequencies for
the RF and IF signals [39,40]. Because heterodyne structures need external LO sig-
nals which are twice the frequency of the received signals, it may cause the difficulty
to generate the external LO signals. Therefore, one can use subharmonic mixers
or self-oscillating mixers to implement the heterodyne structure retro-directive an-
4
crossover circuits. The formulas and folding method are presented in Chapter 2 and
the folding method on designing linear retro-directive antenna array circuits with
arbitrary element numbers are presented in Chapter 3 with the measurement results
of three-element, four-element, and six-element retro-directive antenna arrays.
Using the folding method on designing linear passive retro- and reflecto-nulling
antenna arrays is presented in Chapter 4, which the array has two nulls occurring
at the incident and specular reflection directions [65–67]. Retro- and reflecto-nulling
antenna arrays are implemented by passive circuits with the use of 90◦ hybrids and
phase shifters which are properly connected to the transmitting and receiving an-
tennas. With the use of 90◦ hybrids and phase shifters, retro- and reflecto-nulling
antenna arrays have two nulls at −θi and θi when the incident angle is θi without
using digital signal processing techniques. In other words, the locations of the nulls
can change simultaneously when the direction of incident signal changes through the
implemented retro- and reflecto-nulling antenna array microwave circuits. The for-
mulas and the folding method on designing linear retro- and reflecto-nulling antenna
arrays are presented in Chapter 4 with experimental verifications.
1.4 Chapter Outlines
This report is outlined as follows.
In Chapter 2, the basic principles used in Chapter 3 and 4 are presented. The
analysis starts from the phased array theories. The relations of the direction of the
main beam and the excitation of the array are derived. Next, the formulations of
the retro-directive antenna arrays and retro- and reflecto-nulling antenna arrays for
the array circuits are presented. A folding method to design an array circuit is also
introduced in this chapter.
Chapter 3 presents linear retro-directive antenna arrays using 90◦ hybrids. By
the folding method described in Chapter 2, general structures of linear retro-directive

nulling antenna array.
elements is then
∆φi = φi,m − φi,m−1 = −kd sin θi. (2.2)
If the antenna array retransmits signals at angle θo with an output signal bm for the
m-th antenna, its array factor is given as
F (θo) = b1 + · · ·+ bNe−j(N−1)kd sin θo =
N∑
m=1
bme
−j(m−1)kd sin θo . (2.3)
Then, consider four cases as follows.
A. Retro-directive Array
Assume that the phase difference of two adjacent output signals are reversed to that
of the received signals, in other words, the phase difference of the output signals is
∆φo = kd sin θi. (2.4)
The output signal at the m-th antenna can be expressed as
bm = De
j(m−1)kd sin θi = Dejφo,m , (2.5)
10
Therefore, one needs to design a reflect array circuit to have the phase difference of
the two adjacent retransmitting antennas be ∆φo = ∆φi.
C. Retro-nulling Array
Assume that the phase difference of two adjacent output signals are reversed to that
of the received signals, in other words, the phase difference of the output signals is
∆φo = pi + kd sin θi. (2.10)
The output signal at the m-th antenna can be expressed as
bm = De
j(m−1)(pi+kd sin θi). (2.11)
Then the array factor of the antenna array for the retransmitted signal is given as
F (θo) = D + · · ·+Dej(N−1)(pi+kd sin θi−kd sin θo)
= D
N∑
m=1
ej(m−1)(pi+kd sin θi−kd sin θo). (2.12)
If N is an even number, (2.12) has a null at θi. Therefore the design requirement
for the retro-nulling antenna array circuit is to properly implement the retro-nulling
array circuit to have the phase difference ∆φo = pi − ∆φi for the retransmitted
signals.
D. Reflecto-nulling Array
If the phase difference of two adjacent output signals is
∆φo = pi − kd sin θi, (2.13)
12
Therefore, the output signals can be expressed as

Then, the array factor of the retransmitting antenna array is given as

. (2.24)
In (2.24), one can find that the array factor (2.21) will have a maximum value at
z = 1/u if the S-parameter of the array circuits has only one constant diagonal and
the other diagonals are zero, i.e., for some integer k,
Si,j =

1 if j − i = k,
0 otherwise.
(2.25)
In (2.25), k = 0 can have the largest value of the magnitude of the array factor.
Therefore, the criterion for designing reflect array circuit is to design a circuit whose
S-parameter is a diagonal matrix with all elements in main diagonal being the same.
C. Retro-nulling Array
A retro-nulling antenna array has a null placed at the incident angle. In other words,
the magnitude of the array factor for retransmitting array has a zero at z = u, i.e.,
θo = θi. In (2.22), which is derived from substituting z = u into (2.21), one can

. (2.29)
Therefore, the criterion for designing reflecto-nulling array circuit, which is de-
rived from (2.29), is to design a circuit which each diagonal of the S-parameter of
the array circuit has the same value of zero as shown in Fig. 2.3. For example, the
simplest solution of (2.29) for the S-parameter of the reflecto-nulling array circuit is
18
2.2 90◦ Hybrid
Showing in Fig. 2.4(a) is a two-port circuit consisting of a 90◦ hybrid with its port 3
and port 4 terminated with the same loads of reflection Γ as that used in a reflection-
type phase shifter [68]. Assume that all ports of the hybrid are with perfect match
and isolation. The S-parameter of the hybrid is given as

. (2.32)
As a1 and a2 are the two input signals at the input port 1 and isolated port 2 of
the hybrid, the output signals at the direct port 3 and coupled port 4 become
b3 =
1√
2
(a1e

b4 =

(a1e

2 ). (2.34)
These two signals are now reflected by the terminations connected at the direct port
3 and coupled port 4 of the hybrid. The reflected signals are then
a3 = Γb3 =
Γ√
2
(a1e

a4 = Γb4 =

(a1e

2 ). (2.36)
From the definition of S-parameter, the output signals at the input port 1 and

port 1 and port 2 have a relative phase difference ∆φ and the reflection coefficient
of the termination is Γ = |Γ|ej]Γ, the reflected signals from the same two ports then
become  b1

Therefore the relative phase difference of the reflected signals from port 1 and port 2
is −∆φ. In other words, the two-port circuit given in Fig. 2.4(a) is a phase difference
reversal circuit which can be properly implemented in a retro-directive array circuit.
In practice, one can leave the terminated ports open to have |Γ| ≃ 1. In contrast
to the active Van Atta array by adding unilateral or bi-directional amplifiers in the
midway of transmission lines [34], one can connect active devices with |Γ| > 1, such
as reflection amplifiers, at the terminated ports of the hybrids to give a more flexible
structure of retro-directive array circuit. However, we will limit the study to the
case of passive phase difference reversal circuit in this study.

In order to apply the phase difference reversal circuit given in Fig. 2.4(a) in the
design of retro-directive antenna array with arbitrary numbers of antenna elements,
a folding method is developed as illustrated in Fig. 2.5. The phase difference reversal
circuit basically can be symbolized by having signal 1 and signal 2 cross over to be
the output signals as shown in Fig. 2.5(a). Two cascaded 90◦ hybrids as shown in
Fig. 2.5(b) is a representation of the crossover circuit. If one folds this crossover
circuit along the line of symmetry as shown in Fig. 2.5(c), it gives the result of
the phase difference reversal circuit given in Fig. 2.4. Therefore, one can apply
22
to design the array circuits for these four antenna arrays described in this chapter.

the design of three-element retro-directive circuit is shown in Fig. 3.1(c). Similarly,
the design of four-element retro-directive array circuit is illustrated in Fig. 3.2 based
on the folding method. Note that the two 90◦ hybrids in the first stage of crossover
circuit are moved to the last stage to have the resulting presentation to be symmetric
as given in Fig. 3.2(c).

· · · . It shows the input signal at port 1 goes to port 2N. Similarly the input signal
at port i will go to port 2N+1-i in an even symmetric form. Therefore, it implies
the phase difference between two adjacent antenna elements becomes in reversal for
the input signals and the reflected signals.

numbers of 3, 5, 7, · · · . A 135◦ phase shifter is added in the last stage in order
to have the phase shifts of the signals in the last stage be the same. Therefore,
although the 90◦ hybrid is a balanced structure, one can implement it in a retro-

One can then calculate the main beam directions due to the non-identical termina-
tions.
The second practical consideration is on the mismatch and finite isolation of the
90◦ hybrid. Considering a three-element retro-directive array circuit shown in Fig.
3.1 and having the received signal at the m-th antenna element expressed as (2.1),
the array factor is given by (2.3). The incident signals and the retransmitted signals
are then related by the S-parameters of the retro-directive array circuit given as

isolation terms may cause the array factor to have some variations as φo = φi. In
other words, although the imperfect isolation of retro-directive array circuit does
not directly change the direction of main beam, the magnitude of the array factor
may be affected for different incident angle θi. However, one can properly control
the relative phase difference between S21 and S32 to reduce the imperfect isolation
effect. In practice, as |S21| and |S32| are lower than -15dB, their effects on the array
factor can be neglected.
3.2 Circuit Implementation
Fig. 3.7 shows the photographs of the three-element, four-element, and six-element
retro-directive array circuits implemented using 90◦ microstrip branch line 3 dB
couplers. These passive planar circuits are fabricated on 1.6 mm thick FR4 substrate.
The crossover circuit is implemented by a three-branch 0dB directional coupler with
50Ω microstrip lines. 135◦ and 270◦ phase shifters are implemented by microstrip
delay lines with proper lengths. The terminations of the 90◦ branch line hybrids are
open stubs.
In the retro-directive antenna array design, the transmitting and receiving anten-
nas are rectangular patches with circulators in an orthogonal-polarized arrangement
for the purpose of isolation of the received and retransmitted signals. The patch
antennas are also fabricated on 1.6 mm thick FR4 substrate with 0.48 wavelength
spacing. Each transmitting antenna has a two-stage amplifier to give about 20 dB
power gain and to increase the isolation between input and output signals. The
operation frequency is designed at 2.9 GHz.

3.3 Experimantal Verification
3.3.1 90◦ Hybrid Circuit
In order to illustrate that the 90◦ hybrid can give phase difference reversal charac-
teristics, Fig. 3.8 shows the measurement arrangement using an HP8510C vector
network analyzer and an HP8511 frequency down converter [44]. In the measure-
ment, an HP11667B 3dB power divider equally separates the RF out signal to the
input port and isolated port of a 90◦ hybrid. A Narda model 3752 adjustable coaxial
phase shifter is used to give different phase difference value between the two input
signals. The two input signals are directed to the a1 port and a2 port of the HP8511
through directional couplers. The output signals from the input port and isolated
port of the 90◦ hybrid are then connected to the b1 port and b2 port. The mea-
sured results of the phase relation of the input and output signals are shown in Fig.
3.9. One can find that the phase differences between the two output signals and
the two input signals have a slope about −1 to show the phase difference reversal
characteristics as described in (2.40).
3.3.2 Retro-directive Antenna Arrays
Shown in Fig. 3.10 is the experimental arrangement [44] to measure the bistatic
retransmitted radiation patterns of the developed retro-directive antenna arrays. In
the retro-directive antenna array, its receiving antennas are in vertical polarization
and the transmitting antennas are in horizontal polarization respectively because
the co-polarization radar cross section scattered from the circulators, amplifiers,
and the array circuit may interfere with the retransmitted signals from the retro-
directive antenna array. The illumination antenna and the measurement antenna
are then in vertical polarization and horizontal polarization respectively. The retro-
directive antenna array is located on a computer-controlled rotational positioner.
In the measurement arrangement, the illumination and measurement antennas are

Figure 4.1: A 90◦ hybrid with two out-of-phase terminations at the direct and
coupled ports.
Considering a 90◦ hybrid as shown in Fig. 4.1 [61], the port 3 and port 4 are
terminated with two out-of-phase loads which their reflection coefficients are Γ and
−Γ respectively. If the 90◦ hybrid is matched and has perfect isolation, the S-
parameter of the hybrid is given in (2.32). Based on the results in Chapter 2, the
output signals at the direct port and coupled port are given in (2.33) and (2.34).
Therefore, the reflected signals at port 3 and port 4 shown in Fig. 4.1 become

Based on the procedure described above, one can prove that the retransmitted
radiation pattern has a null at the angle of reflection. One then can construct a linear
reflecto-nulling antenna array as shown in Fig. 4.3. The transmitting and receiving
antenna are in an orthogonal-polarized arrangement for the purpose of isolation. The
hybrid circuit is fabricated on FR4 substrate with thickness of 1.6 mm. Rectangular
50
patterns of the four-element reflecto-nulling antenna array at five different incident
angles, from −40◦ to 40◦ with 20◦ spacing are shown in Figs. 4.4.
We also measure the case when the circuit is replaced by four open circuits
connected to the circulators because it will re-transmit the signals to the specular
direction satisfying the Snell’s law of reflection. All of the radiation patterns in Figs.
4.4 are normalized to the maxima of the radiation pattern for the array with a main
beam at the angle of reflection. One can find that the null of the re-transmitted
radiation pattern is at −θi with the incident angle being θi. Compared to the case
when the proposed hybrid circuit is replaced by four open circuits, it also shows that
the array with the proposed hybrid circuit can lower the radiation pattern at the
angle of reflection. Because of the room clutter and coupling between illumination
and measurement antenna, certain side-lobe levels have higher levels.
4.1.3 Summary
In this section, a novel approach of linear reflecto-nulling antenna array using 90◦
hybrids is proposed. A four-element passive array with experimental results is pre-
sented. The measured patterns demonstrate that the null of the re-transmitted
radiation is at the angle of reflection. This approach can be further implemented as
an arbitrary number one-dimensional antenna array to make a null at the angle of
reflection in the re-transmitted radiation pattern.

the received signal at the m-th antenna can be expressed as
am = Ae
−j(m−1)kd sin θi = Aej(m−1)φi,m , (4.10)
where m = 1, 2, · · · , N . k is the wave number of the incident wave and d is the
antenna element spacing. If the antenna array transmits signals with an output
signal bm at the m-th antenna, its array factor is given as
F (θo) = b1 + · · ·+ bme−j(m−1)kd sin θo + · · ·+ bNe−j(N−1)kd sin θo . (4.11)
Because nulls occur when the array factor shown in (4.11) is equal to zero, one can
design a retro- and reflecto-nulling antenna array by arranging zeros of the array
factor in proper locations and then the nulls occur at θo = ±θi.
By array theories, one can generate one null in broadside by dividing an antenna
array into two parts which are out-of-phase. First, if one alters the phase difference
between these two subarrays from pi to pi − pkd sin θi where p = N/2, then the null
will shift from broadside to −θi. This result is consistent with (2.13) which is the
criterion of the S-parameter for reflecto-nulling antenna array circuits. For example,
the array factor of a four-element array can be expressed as
F (θo) = b1 + b2e
−jkd sin θo + b3e−j2kd sin θo + b4e−j3kd sin θo
= (b1 + b2e
−jkd sin θo) + e−j2kd sin θo(b3 + b4e−jkd sin θo)
= F1(θo) + e
−j2kd sin θoF2(θo).
(4.12)
In (4.12), one can find that this four-element array can be considered as two sub-
arrays with spacing of 2d. Each sub-array has two elements with spacing of d. If
the phase difference between F1(θo) and F2(θo) is pi − 2kd sin θi, i.e.,
F2(θo) = −e−j2kd sin θiF1(θo), (4.13)
56
In (4.16), one can find that F1(θo) has a null at θo = θi. In fact, (4.15) is the same
with (2.10) which is the criterion in designing array circuits for retro-nulling antenna
arrays. Furthermore, by substituting (4.16) into (4.14), the resulting array factor
can be expressed as
F (θo) = b1(1− ejkd(sin θi−sin θo))(1− e−j2kd(sin θi+sin θo)). (4.17)
In (4.17), one can observe that there are two zeros at θo = ±θi. In other words, the
criteria (2.10) and (2.13) shown in Chapter 2 are used together to design retro- and
reflecto-nulling antenna arrays. As a result, the retro- and reflecto-nulling antenna
arrays can be implemented by these approaches.
4.2.1 Hybrid Circuits Design
Figs. 4.6 show the basic principle to implement a four-element retro- and reflecto-
nulling antenna array using the folding method. In Fig. 4.6(a), in order to make
the relative phase difference of the array factors between the two sub-arrays become
pi−2kd sin θi, the array circuit is arranged in reflection symmetry (or line symmetry)
with respect to the dashed line shown in Fig. 4.6(a). Furthermore, to have the phase
difference between the first element and the second element in the first sub-array
be pi + kd sin θi, crossover circuits and 180
◦ phase shifters are used. The crossover
circuits can be implemented by two cascaded 90◦ hybrids as shown in Fig. 4.6(b).
If one folds this crossover circuit along the line of symmetry shown in Fig. 4.6(b),
and places two 180◦ phase shifters at the first and the fourth output ports, its gives
the result of retro- and reflecto-nulling antenna array circuit. Therefore, one can
apply this folding method to design retro- and reflecto-nulling array circuits with
even number of elements.
Figs. 4.7 illustrate the folding method to design a three-element retro- and
reflecto-nulling antenna array. Note that the second input signal is split to have an
58
even number of signals in order to apply the method of dividing the array into two
sub-arrays. After combining the second signal with the third signal as the second
output signal shown in Fig. 4.7(a), one can then apply the folding method. Figs.
4.7(b) and (c) illustrate the process to implement a three-element retro- and reflecto-
nulling antenna array using the folding method. Therefore, this method also can be
used to design retro- and reflecto-nulling array circuits with odd number of elements.
4.2.2 General Structures
In the following, two general structures of retro- and reflecto-nulling array circuits
with arbitrary numbers of antenna elements using 90◦ hybrids are presented. Fig.
4.8 shows the general structure of a 2m-element retro- and reflecto-nulling array
circuit. This structure covers the arrays with element numbers of 4, 6, 8, · · · . In Fig.
4.8, the m-port phase difference reversal circuits are the array circuits developed in
Chapter 3 and shown in Figs. 3.3 - 3.5. A m-port phase difference reversal circuit
can have the input signal at port 1 go to port m. Similarly, the input signal at
port i will go to port m − i in an even symmetric form. Therefore, the two phase
difference reversal circuits of the retro- and reflecto-nulling array circuit shown in
Fig. 4.8 can have its S-parameter be written as

and
yi = −xi (4.20)
where i = 1, 2, · · · ,m. The simplest solution set of (4.19) is to let x1, x2, · · · , xm
be the m-th roots of unity. In Fig. 4.8, assume that the phase shifters are perfect
matched and reciprocal. The S-matrix of the i-th phase shifter given by SP(i) is
expressed as
SP(i) =
 0 SP21(i)
SP21(i) 0
 (4.21)
where i = 1, 2, · · · , 2m. Therefore, one can make the S-parameter of the array
circuit satisfy (4.19) and (4.20) by properly designing the phase delays of the phase
shifters.
Fig. 4.9 is an example of six-element retro- and reflecto-nulling array circuit.
The two three-port phase difference reversal circuits in Fig. 4.9 can have the input
signal at port 1 go to port 3, and vice versa, whereas the input signal at port 2 goes
back to port 2. To satisfy the criteria (4.19) and (4.20), the S21 values of the phase

satisfied, (4.30) becomes
F (z) = (u− z)(1− u2z2) + Γ(1 + uz + u2z2 + u3z3)
= (1 + uz)
[
(u− z)(1− uz) + Γ(1 + u2z2)] . (4.33)
By the fundamental theorem of algebra, a non-zero single-variable polynomial,
with complex coefficients, has exactly as many complex roots as its degree, if each
root is counted up to its multiplicity [72]. Therefore, there are three roots in F (z) =
0 because the degree of (4.33), which is a polynomial with complex coefficients, is
three. In (4.33), one can observe that there is a null when z = − 1
u
, i.e., there is a
null locating at
θo =

sin−1(1− sin θi) if θi ≥ 0,
sin−1(−1− sin θi) if θi ≤ 0.
(4.34)
If the magnitude of Γ is small, the other two roots of (4.33) are near to ±θi. Figs.
4.12 illustrate the magnitude of the normalized array factor changes with |Γ|. The
normalized array factor is defined as

Table 4.1 then quantitatively lists the locations of the three nulls of (4.33). In Table
4.1, the null at 41.1◦ for θi = 20◦ and the null at 20.9◦ for θi = 40◦ are resulted from
the factor (1 + uz) in (4.33) and its solution is given by (4.34) which are shown not
affected by the mismatch effect and only related to the incident angle. Therefore,
one can find that the mismatch effect causes the nulls deviate to the left side as
shown in Figs. 4.12, i.e., to the smaller angle. In addition, the mismatch of the
array circuits affect the reflecto-nulls more severely than the retro-nulls.
The second practical consideration is on the error in the phase delays of the
phase shifters. Assume that the reflection coefficients described in (4.31) are all Γ.

If the conditions S2,1 = −S1,2 = −1 and S3,4 = −S4,3 = −1 are not satisfied, i.e.,
S2,1 and S3,4 are given as
S2,1 = −S1,2ejδ (4.36)
S3,4 = −S4,3ejδ (4.37)
where S1,2 = 1 and S4,3 = 1, then the array factor shown in (4.30) becomes
F (z) = (u− zejδ) + (z − uejδ)u2z2
+Γ(1 + uz + u2z2 + u3z3). (4.38)
Figs. 4.13 illustrate the results that the phase error δ affects the locations and
depths of the nulls. Table 4.2 lists their resulting values. The reflection coefficient
Γ is assumed to be -25 dB and its phase is set to be 0◦ in the calculation. In Fig.
4.13, one can find that if the phase shifters have phase errors, the nulls will become
shallower. The locations of the reflecto-nulls are shown not affected by the phase
errors of the phase shifters, and the retro-nulls move slightly.

crostrip branch line couplers. These passive planar circuits are fabricated on 1.6
mm thick FR4 substrate. The crossover circuit is implemented by a three-branch 0
dB directional coupler with 50 Ω microstrip lines. The 5.35 dB directional coupler
is designed by properly choosing the values of Zos and Zop, where Zos is the char-
acteristic impedance of series arms and Zop is the characteristic impedance of shunt
arms in the branch-line coupler [73]. 135◦ and 270◦ phase shifters are implemented
by microstrip delay lines with proper lengths. The terminations of the 90◦ hybrid
circuits are open stubs. For the five-element and six-element array circuits, two
three-port phase difference reversal circuits are used. Therefore, one can use (3.7)
to properly modify the length of the open stubs in order to reduce the number of
phase shifters at the retransmitting antenna array, and then only two phase shifters
are needed.
4.2.5 Measurement Results
Shown in Fig. 4.15 is the experimental arrangement to measure the bistatic re-
transmitted radiation patterns of the developed retro- and reflecto-nulling antenna
arrays. The measurement arrangement is given in Sec. 3.3.2. The measured and
simulated retransmitting radiation patterns of the three-element, four-element, five-
element, and six-element retro- and reflecto-nulling antenna arrays at five different
incident angles, from −40◦ to 40◦ with 20◦ spacing are shown in Fig. 4.16. In Fig.
4.16, the dashed lines represent the simulated radiation patterns and the solid lines
represent the measured radiation patterns. In the simulation, The excitations of
the retransmitting antenna arrays are calculated from the S-parameters of the hy-
brid circuits which are simulated by Agilent ADS [69] and the input signals of the
receiving antenna array using MATLAB [70]. The single element patch antenna is
simulated using Agilent ADS Momentum [71]. The simulated radiation patterns of
the retransmitting antenna arrays in Fig. 4.16 are then calculated by multiplying
the array factor with the radiation pattern of the single element patch antenna and
76
The proposed approach can be used to design hybrid circuits for retro- and reflecto-
nulling antenna arrays without using any digital signal processing techniques. A
folding method is used to design the retro- and reflecto-nulling antenna array cir-
cuits with arbitrary numbers of radiating elements. Three-element, four-element,
five-element, and six-element linear retro- and reflecto-nulling antenna arrays are
implemented. The measured retransmitting radiation patterns are shown that there
are two nulls at ±θi when the incident angle is θi.

for the planar hybrid circuits. The transmission lines in Van-Atta arrays, on the
other hands, are purposely implemented to have the same length as that of the line
to connect two furtherest array elements. This will the introduce unnecessary line
losses for those other lines with unwanted extra lengths. The general structures of
the retro-directive array circuits are shown in this chapter. Then one can use this
method to design a retro-directive array circuit with an arbitrary number of antenna
elements. The practical considerations are also discussed, and the measurement
results of the three-element, four-element, and six-element retro-directive antenna
arrays are shown in good agreement with the simulation results.
In Chapter 4, the folding method on designing linear passive retro- and reflecto-
nulling antenna arrays is presented. A retro- and reflecto-nulling antenna array has
two nulls occurring at the incident and specular directions. The theory developed
in Chapter 2 can be utilized to design a retro- and reflecto-nulling array circuit with
arbitrary number of antenna elements. The array circuit is implemented by passive
circuits with the use of 90◦ hybrids and phase shifters. The general structures of the
retro- and reflecto-nulling antenna arrays are shown in this chapter. The practical
considerations of the retro- and reflecto-nulling array circuits are discussed, and
then the measurement results of the three-element, four-element, five-element, and
six-element retro- and reflecto-nulling antenna arrays are shown to verify the theory
developed in this chapter.
Adaptive antenna arrays can also achieve the functions of retro-directive antenna
arrays and retro- and reflecto-nulling antenna arrays. By using algorithms of adap-
tive antenna theories which utilize digital signal processing techniques to properly
adjust the phase shifters, desired radiation patterns can be synthesized. Although
the adaptive antenna array can synthesize beams and nulls with arbitrary numbers
in desired locations, this method need iterative computations and may have restric-
tions on high speed applications. The arrays developed in this study, however, use
analog circuitry, hence they can achieve real-time responses.

Abstract  —  S-matrix reconstruction transforms are based on 
two stages of matrix transformation to remove the mismatch-
induced errors. Over the years, these transforms are widely used 
in measurements of multiport devices using two-port vector 
network analyzer, especially for noncoaxial applications because 
high-quality matched loads are hardly accessible. In this paper, 
analytical error analysis of the S-matrix reconstruction 
transforms is performed to show that three S-matrix transforms 
have the exact same accuracy. Additionally, the concept of 
acquiring stationary solutions is presented to improve the 
accuracy of reconstructing S-matrix with strongly reflecting 
auxiliary terminations. For noncoaxial measurements, strongly 
reflecting termination, such as a short-circuited or an open-
circuited transmission line is more repeatable, reliable and 
economical than terminations with loss like resistors. 
Consequently, the use of strongly reflecting auxiliary 
terminations is speculated to ease noncoaxial multiport 
measurements. 
Index Terms —Multiport network, scattering parameter 
measurement, noncoaxial device, S-matrix reconstruction. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The scattering matrix (S-matrix) has been a vital part of 
microwave design, analysis and measurement for decades. 
More recently, with the data transfer rate pushing beyond 
gigabit per second barrier, its applications extend to signal 
integrity characterization of high-speed digital systems [1]. 
Meanwhile, the trends toward monolithic integration and 
differential operation [2] are making noncoaxial multiport 
devices more and more common. Those noncoaxial multiport 
devices pose challenges to modern vector network analyzers 
(VNAs) in aspects of port number, operating frequency range, 
cost and the complexity of the required cabling and fixturing. 
Accordingly, measuring an n-port device with a VNA having 
less ports will not be uncommon in the future. 
Measuring an n-port device under test (DUT) with a VNA 
having less ports is not a new issue. Historically, the use of a 
two-port VNA along with high-quality matched loads is a 
practical approach to measuring the multiport S-matrix. 
Furthermore, many mathematical formulas for properly 
removing the mismatch-induced errors have been developed 
[3]-[8]. As a result, one can take advantage of low-cost loads 
or terminations with other impedance values as auxiliary 
terminations. The mathematical formulas [3]–[10] largely 
broaden the applicability of a two-port VNA. 
Among these error-correction formulas, port 
renormalization [3], Gamma-R [4] and Gamma-Sigma [5] 
methods can be classified as S-matrix reconstruction 
transforms. For convenient discussion, methods in [4] and [5] 
are, respectively, named after the variables the authors 
defined. As will be summarized in Sec. II, S-matrix 
reconstruction transforms [3]–[5] are based on two stages of 
matrix transformation to remove the mismatch-induced errors, 
and impose no constraint on the use of auxiliary terminations. 
Over the years, these transforms are widely used in 
measurements of multiport DUTs using a two-port VNA, 
especially for noncoaxial applications as high-quality matched 
loads are hardly accessible. [9]–[11] are three recent 
examples that refer to [3]–[5], respectively. 
The formulations of S-matrix reconstruction transforms 
impose no constraint on the use of auxiliary terminations. 
However, different auxiliary terminations results in distinct 
accuracy for the reconstructed S-matrix of a specific DUT, as 
indicated from the experiment results presented in 2010 
APMC [12]. 
In this paper, for the case of auxiliary terminations being all 
identical, analytical error analysis is perform to show that 
three S-matrix transforms have the exact same accuracy. 
Based on the analytical error analysis, the causes of the 
numerical instability observed in previous studies are 
elucidated. Additionally, the concept of acquiring stationary 
solutions is presented to improve the accuracy of 
reconstructing S-matrix with strongly reflecting auxiliary 
terminations. 
II. SUMMARY OF S-MATRIX RECONSTRUCTION TRANSFORMS 
For measuring an n-port S-matrix with the use of a two-port 
VNA and the auxiliary terminations 1 2[ , , , ] nZ Z Z Z , the set 
of number of ports {1, 2, …, n} is first divided into two 
disjoint subsets [5]. These are  1 2,J j j  for the two 
measured ports and  1 2 2, , ,  nK k k k  for the other n-2 ports 
terminated in auxiliary terminations

Therefore, the possible combinations of J and K are both 
2
nC  or  1 2n n . For each two-port measurement, the 
measured two-port S-matrix can be related to the n-port S-
matrix S  and auxiliary terminations    as [5]

By comparing (7) with (17), it is evident that 
   

Consequently, one can show that 
      cond cond U S ,  (19) 
which is also identical to (13). 
D. Mathematical Cause of Numerical Instability 
Every square matrix can be put into the Jordan form. 
Therefore, one can express S in the Jordan form, i.e., 
1 M J M  and show that 
   1  U S M U J M  
   1 ME U D M . (20) 
In (20), 1 2, , ,     nD diag  is the diagonal matrix 
consisting of the eigenvalues of S , and E  is an elementary 
matrix that performs row operations. According to (20) and 
the properties of the condition number, one can learn that 
      cond U S cond U D .  (21) 
As calculated with the 2-norm condition number, the lower 
bound in (21) can be recast in the form

For a passive DUT, the net real power delivered to the 
network must be greater than zero, that is, 
  *Re 0tV I ,  (23) 
where  1 2

respectively, the port voltages and currents. With the aid of 
(23), one can show that  HU S S   is positive definite, and 
prove that  1 i  for 1,2, ,i n . Consequently,   
  1 1 11 2max , , , 2          n . (24) 
According to (22) and (24), it is the denominator in (22) that 
dominates the value of the condition number.  
IV. NUMERICAL VERIFICATION 
For   U , it has been experimentally shown in APMC 
2010 [12] and analytically proved in Sec. III that  1 2 3    . 
In this section, numerical experiments are conducted. The 
cause of numerical instability is elucidated with (22). 
Moreover, the concept of acquiring stationary solutions is 
presented to improve the accuracy of reconstructing S-matrix 
with strongly reflecting auxiliary terminations.

Abstract—In this paper, a rectangular waveguide probe is
designed as a near-field scanning probe in a microwave mi-
croscope. With the use of a rectangular cavity and properly
tuning the three-screw tuner to change the resonant mode of
the cavity, the structural characteristic of the sample under test
can be observed through the cavity perturbation phenomenon.
The reflection coefficient acquired from the scanning probe is
dependent on the physical parameters of the sample under test.
Several samples of various structures are measured to illustrate
the operation of the scanning near-field microwave microscope.
Index Terms—Near-field microwave microscope, rectangular
cavity.
I. INTRODUCTION
Microwave imaging technology is capable of nondestructive
testing because microwave signal has much lower photon
energy than X-ray and ultraviolet which are often used in
small structure imaging systems. However, the resolution
of microwave imaging system is limited by the wavelength
because of the diffraction characteristic of waves. Near-field
microwave microscope is capable of resolving objects much
smaller than the wavelength of the excited wave by using
the characteristic of evanescent electromagnetic wave [1].
Evanescent microwave fields were first used by Bethe in
calculating the coupling coefficient of microwave waveguides
with a aperture which is much smaller than the microwave
wavelength [2]. There are several methods to generate the
evanescent waves. When a plane wave incident from a more
dense medium to a less dense one with an incident angle
larger than the critical angle, the total reflection occurs. The
evanescent wave is then generated and propagates along the
interface between these two media. In the reactive near-field
region of an antenna, the field is non-radiated and localized
near the radiator, which is also called evanescent wave region.
Therefore, one can use these methods to generate evanescent
waves and utilize it to implement a microwave microscopic
imaging system.
In [3], an evanescent microwave probe is implemented by
microstrip line resonator with an electric or magnetic dipole
probe. The distance between the sample under test (SUT) and
the probe is as near as possible to make sure the SUT is in
the reactive near-field region and the size of the probe has
to be small for higher resolution. By measuring the reflection
coefficient of the probe while the probe is scanning the sample,
the characteristics of the structure of SUT can be observed
from the variations of reflection coefficient. In [3], a lock-in
amplifier was used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.
In this study, a rectangular waveguide probe is designed as a
near-field scanning probe. The probe consists of a rectangular
cavity with a narrow slot and a section of WR-90 rectangular
waveguide. By using the reactive near-field generated by the
slot, one can use this probe in the vicinity of the SUT and
measure the reflection coefficient with the use of a vector
network analyzer (VNA) when the location of the probe is
changed. In this study, one-dimensional scanning is conducted,
and measurement results of the near-field scanning waveguide
probe for several SUTs of various structures are presented.
II. DESIGN
In the developed scanning near-field microwave microscope,
a rectangular waveguide probe is designed as a near-field
scanning probe. The block diagram of the rectangular cavity
probe for near-field scanning is shown in Fig. 1. The probe
consists of a rectangular cavity with a narrow slot and a section
of rectangular waveguide. The cavity is coupled through a
parallel resonant aperture. A three-screw tuner is used to let
the cavity be critically coupled. By tuning this three-screw
tuner, one can excite specific resonant modes of the rectangular
cavity, and then the surface current distribution of the end-side
wall of the cavity can be varied for different resonant modes.
For example, consider a hollow rectangular cavity as shown
in Fig. 2 made up of a rectangular waveguide with cross
section of a × b and length d, the resonance frequencies are
given by

where c is the velocity of the light, and the number m, n,
and p are integers. Then the distribution of the magnetic field
intensity H at the end-side wall z = d can be expressed as

Abstract—In this study, a novel amplitude-only method to
measure the phase difference between two incident signals is
developed. For a 90◦ hybrid, it can be shown as two signals with
relative phase difference ∆Φ incident to the input and isolated
ports, their phase difference can be calculated from the measured
power data by having two detectors connected to the direct and
coupled ports. The general formulas and measurement results of
a special condition are presented.
Index Terms—90◦ hybrid, phase difference measurement.
I. INTRODUCTION
The method of direction of arrival (DOA) is conducted in
many researches and its applications can be founded in the
field of wireless communications. It is important to acquire
the phase difference among receiving antennas in order to
find the DOA of the incident signal. Most approaches utilize
digital signal processing technique to implement the algorithm
of DOA estimation. For higher frequency range, to measure the
phase difference between two signals becomes more difficult.
In order to obtain the DOA, the phase difference between
the RF input signals can be measured using the output in-
phase and quadrature baseband signals by using six-port
circuit [1], [2]. In this study, a novel approach to use a four
port hybrid circuit and two power sensors is developed. By
using this approach, one can use the measured amplitude-only
output signals of the hybrid to calculate the phase difference
between two input signals. The formulas, simulation, and a
measurement result of a special condition for the verification
are presented.

From (6) and (7), if b3 = B3ejφ3 and b4 = B4ejφ4 , one can
find that
B3 = A

B4 = A

Therefore, one can find that the phases of b3 and b4 are in-
phase or out-of-phase, and the magnitude of b3 and b4 are the
function of the phase difference θ1 − θ2. Then, this property
of 90◦ hybrid can be utilized to measure the phase difference
between two input signals.

Because of the high isolation of 90◦ hybrid and the high
return loss of the power sensors used in P3 and P4 shown
in Fig. 5, the measured result of P3 and P4 is expected to
give a degenerated straight line. Figure 6 shows the measured
power values at P3 and P4 by varying the variable phase
shifter in Fig. 5. In Fig. 6, the phase difference shown in
the horizontal axis is measured by an Agilent N5230A four-
port vector network analyzer. Figure 7 shows the ellipse trace
determined by measured result of P3 and P4. From Fig. 7, one

can observe that it is almost a straight line. This is because in
the experimental arrangement shown in Fig. 5 the isolation
of the hybrid and the reflection coefficients of the power
sensors are all close to zero. In other words, Re{ΓI} in (25)
approaches to zero. In the case of Fig. 5, one can only use
it to measure the phase difference between two signals in the
range of −pi/2 to pi/2. If one can design a four port circuit
which has a finite isolation and the reflection coefficients of
the power sensors are not close to zero, the plot of P3 and
P4 will yield an ellipse. Then one can only need to change
at least five different positions of the variable phase shifter to
measure the power values P3 and P4, and use these data to
yield an ellipse trace to determine the phase difference of two
incident signals.
IV. CONCLUSION
In this study, a novel amplitude-only method to measure the
phase difference between two incident signals is developed.
