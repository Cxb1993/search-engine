2recover the secret data, authorized participants
with sufficient shadows can cooperate to
recover the secret data. Blakely [1] and Shamir
[2] first introduced the (t, n)-threshold secret
sharing system in 1979. In this system, a dealer
can encode and divide the secret data into n
shadows. Then, the dealer distributes the
shadows to the involved participants. Any t out
of n authorized participants can provide their
shadows and cooperate to recover the secret
data.
Recently, the concept of (t, n)-threshold
secret sharing has been usually exploited to
share precious and confidential imagery [5-8].
Thien and Lin [9] proposed a secret image
sharing scheme. In their scheme, a dealer
generates n distinct shadows from the secret
image for all participants. Any t out of n
participants can cooperate to recover the
lossless secret image. Based on Thien and Lin’s 
scheme, Wang and Shyu [10] introduce a
scalable secret image sharing scheme with three
sharing modes, which are the multisecret, the
priority, and the progressive modes. Each
participant can be assigned a different priority
shadow. Hence, the quality of the recovered
secret image depends on the priorities of the
shadows. Nevertheless, the generated n
shadows in [9] and [10] are random-like images.
A malicious intruder may attract attraction to
such meaningless (random-like) shadows
delivered via an insecure channel. Besides, to
share the secret image with lossless, the size of
the original secret image may be expanded in [9,
10].
To accomplish the purpose of meaningful
shadows, the steganography approach is utilized
to camouflage the shadows in host images. The
embedded host images are also called the
shadow images (or the stego images) [11-13].
From the visual perception, the content of the
shadow image is meaningful so the shadows
can be concealed from intruders. Thus, the
quality of the shadow images is an important
essential in the secret sharing mechanism. The
image sharing methods proposed by Lin and
Tsai [12] and Wu et al. [13] produce shadows
based on the (t-1)-degree polynomial and
embed shadows to host images. However, the
revealed secret image is distorted due to
truncating gray pixels with values larger than
250. If the shared media are artistic and medical
images, any slight distortion may be intolerable.
To reveal the secret image with lossless, Zhao
et al. [14] and Chang et al. [15] used two pixels
to represent the exceeding gray values.
Unfortunately, these improved processes result
in the expansion of the secret image. It may
reduce the capacity of the embedded secret data
and distort the quality of shadow images. In
addition, the maximum secret capacity of [12,
16] is a quarter of the size of the host image. In
[9, 11, 13, 15], the capacity of the embedded
secret is also limited.
In general, the derived shadows often lead to
problems of shadow expansion,
meaninglessness, quality and fidelity [14, 17,
18]. The sharing schemes shall encode the
secret image without expanding the image size
or requiring any extra information. The shadow
must be meaningful for camouflaged purposes.
Hence, the quality of the shadow images must
be satisfactory. Moreover, the fidelity of the
revealed secret data must be distortion-free
(lossless).
In this project, we propose a new image
sharing scheme that satisfies all of these
essentials and possesses reversible
characteristics. The reversibility of the proposed
scheme allows authorized participants to
reconstruct the distorted host image to the
original one after retrieving the secret data.
Reconstructing an original host image without
distortion [19, 20] is especially important for
medical, military, or artistic images. Recently,
many image-processing techniques, including
image hiding, steganography, image
authentication, and digital watermarking
[21-23], focus on achieving reversibility.
Unfortunately, current meaningful sharing
schemes [9, 11-13, 15, 16] are incapable of
reconstructing the shadow image to the original
host image. Inspired by potential practicability,
we design a reversible image sharing scheme
based on sudoku for preserving the fidelity of
valuable host images. Sudoku [24-27] is a
logic-based number placement puzzle which is
presented on a square grid. The proposed
scheme utilizes the concept of sudoku to
conceal the shadow with reversibility.
4III. THE PROPOSED SCHEME
Given a shared secret image, the dealer is
responsible for deriving shadows from secret
image and producing n shadow images
(steganography). The new sharing process is
introduced in Subsection III.A. Given any t out
of n shadow images, the involved participants
can losslessly reconstruct the secret image and
the host image. Subsection III.B discusses how
to retrieve the secret image and reconstruct the
original host image.

the digits from 0 to 15
A. The (t, n) Sharing Procedure
Let S be a shared secret image formed by a
sequence of bit streams. To share the secret S
with sudoku, the new scheme extends the size
of a sudoku grid to 1616 to increase the secret
capacity. Besides, to suit the embedding process,
the sudoku grid filled with the digits from 0 to
15. Fig. 2 demonstrates an instance of a 1616
sudoku grid using the digits from 0 to 15.
Preliminaries
In the proposed sharing scheme, the dealer
has to assign a unique key Ki to each participant,
where i =1, 2, …, n. In addition, suppose that O
is the grayscale host image with HW pixels.
The pre-process is listed as follows.
Step 1: Pair each pixel in O. That is, there are
(HW)/2 pixel pairs.
Step 2: Generate a matrix M with the size of
HW. Here, M is consisted of sudoku
grids with the size 1616, as shown in
Fig. 3.
Step 3: Divide the secret bit stream S into
non-overlapping segments with 4 bits,
where 1621 ),,,( msssS  . Here, s1, s2, …, 
sm are the base-16 numeral system
digits.
For instance, when the secret bit stream is
(1010 0011)2, we can segment the stream into
two digits (10, 3)16. In the new approach,
instead of embedding one secret pixel into the
polynomial F(x) [12, 16], the new scheme
embeds (t-1) secret digits into F(x). This
increases the capacity of the embedded secret
data. For convenience, assume that the shared
(t-1) digits of S are s1, s2, …, st-1. The processes
of how to generate and camouflage the shadows
is described in the following phases.
Shadow Derivation Phase
Let ga and gb be the selected pixel pair. The
purpose of reversible sharing is to share the
secret digits s1, s2,…,st-1 and to preserve the
original values of ga and gb.
Step 1: Learn the value m of the sudoku digit
by mapping the row ga and column gb at
a matrix M, where
m = M(ga, gb). (3)
Step 2: Formulate an invertible polynomial F(x)
as
16mod)()( 11

Step 3: Generate n shadows yi’s by feeding the 
secret key Ki into F(x), where
y1 = F(K1), y2 = F(K2), …, and yn = F(Kn).(5)
For example, in the (3, 3)-threshold system
with the matrix M (shown in Fig. 3), the dealer
can share two digits (10)16 and (3)16 of S into a
pair of O, whose pixel pair (ga, gb) is (14, 7).
The value of m can be computed by m = M(ga,
gb) = 6 in Equation (3). Thus, F(x) can be
formulated as

To achieve the purposes of steganography,
most shadow embedding approaches are based
on bit replacement [12, 15, 16], which leads to
the distortion of the host image. That is, these
6B. Secret Revealing Procedure
Given any t out of n shadow images O'j’s and the 
keys Kj’s from the involved participants, the secret 
image S and the lossless host image O can be
reconstructed, where j = 1, 2, …, t. We first assume
that (g'a_j, g'b_j) is the corresponding pixel pair of O'j.
To extract the (t-1) secret digits and restore the
original pixel pair, the authorized participants must
derive the polynomial F(x) from t pairs. Thus, the
participants obtain the shadows y'j’s by mapping the 
row g'a_j and the column g'b_j at the same sudoku
matrix M, where
y'j = M(g'a_j, g'b_j). (7)
With t shadows y'j’s and secret keys Kj’s, the 
polynomial F(x) can be reconstructed by Lagrange’s 
interpolation formula:
16mod)()( 11

The authorized participants can thereby obtain the
secret digits 121 ,,, tsss  by extracting the last (t-1)
coefficients of F(x). Meanwhile, they can obtain the
feature value m at the first coefficient of F(x). The
participants can restore the original pixel pair (ga_j,
gb_j) by selecting the row ga_j and the column gb_j
which is corresponding to the element value m at the
same sudoku block.
Repeating the above processes, authorized
participants can restore the host image O losslessly
and extract all secret digits. Finally, they can recover
the secret image S by transforming all secret digits
into binary representation.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
To evaluate the performance of the proposed
image sharing with steganography approach, the
capacity of the secret image and the quality of the
shadow images are the main consideration. Table 1
lists the qualities of the shadow images with various
test images. This experiment is implemented in the
case of the (2, n) -threshold system. Each of the host
pair can be embedded one secret digit (i.e. 4 bits).
Hence, the embeddable secret capacity equals to
4(t-1)((HW)/2) = 41((512512)/2) = 52,4288
bits. The average PSNR values of shadow images 1
and 2 are about 44.10 dB and 44.33 dB, respectively.

Table 2 shows the qualities of the shadow images
in the case of the (3, n)-threshold system. Averagely,
the PSNR values of three shadow images are around
44.13 dB, 44.39 dB, and 44.14 dB. The capacity of
the secret image is increased to 42((512512)/2) =
104,8576 bits while t = 3. Due to the new scheme
adopts the sudoku block with 16 digits, in which the
block size is 44 and the distortion for each host
pixel is limited within [0, 3]. As the PSNR results,
we can observe that the quality of the shadow image
is satisfactory.
From the visual perception of shadow images, we
display the original host image Lena in Fig. 5(a) and
the generated three shadow images in Figs. 5(b) to
5(d), respectively. Compared the original host image
with these three shadow images, the distortion is
8V. CONCLUSIONS
The revealed secret image inevitably is
distorted due to the truncation of the grayscale
secret image for common secret image sharing
approaches. It is unacceptable for significant
secret content even the distortion is slight. In
this project, we propose a new secret image
sharing scheme that can retrieve the lossless
secret image and satisfy the related sharing
essentials. Moreover, the proposed reversible
scheme offers a large embedding capacity
compared with related camouflage sharing
schemes. After the secret image is revealed
from any t of n shadow images, the authorized
participants can restore the original host image
from the shadow images. The reversibility of
the new sharing scheme is a practical essential
to preserve the valuable host images, such as
military and medical images.
The participant in the sharing approach,
however, may provide a fake shadow image and
cheat other participants during the secret
revealing procedure. The cheater who collects
the genuine shadows thereby can reveal the
secret image. Hence, how to detect the cheater
during cooperation is an important issue in the
sharing scheme. The further research aims to
satisfy the requirements of cheating detection
and cheater identification. The first allows the
participants to detect whether a cheater exists or
not during the cooperation. The second allows
the involved participants to identify the cheater
and locate the tampered areas of the fake
shadow image. The secret image sharing
scheme with reversibility and cheater defense
can provide extensively practical in the really
world.
