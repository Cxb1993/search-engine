273.8±6.26 years, in contrast to 72.8±5.85 years for
those who had no falls over 12-month. Most of the
fall events took place during daytime (91.1%) and
outside (outside: 69.9%; inside: 30.1%). Forty-six
percent of subjects fell dizzy before falling. Eye
disease symptom, alcohol use, physical exercise,
and Timed Up, Go Test (TUGT) and Bedroom
Safety scores were significantly associated with
fall. Vision status, knee joint disease and per-
ceived health status were significantly associated
with recurrent falls. Among related risk factors,
the odd ratio of alcohol use more than 20g per day
and without regular exercise were 10.9
(95%CI=2.8-43.2) and 9.8 (95%CI=2.7-36.3) re-
spectively. Conclusion: Evidence drawn from this
study demonstrates alcohol restraint and exercise
of community-based programs are important im-
plications for further fall prevention intervention
for the elder people in the aboriginal community in
Taiwan.
The third year, we investigate the factors affecting
the use of telecare and need assessment for
E-health surveillances of solitary elderly people in
the future. Totally ninety-one users and one hun-
dred twelve non-users were recruited in this study.
The results reveal that health status was the most
important factor related to the use of Lifeline. The
users were significantly worse than non-users both
in subjective self-reported health status and dis-
eases. For the compliance of wearing the portable
help button, few subjects (3.2%) were
Fully-compliant. The main reasons for not wearing
portable button were forgetting and feeling of
troublesome. Although users were highly satisfied
with Lifeline, aboriginal users thought that lan-
guage barrier with service center were the most
important defect needed to resolve. From the
non-users analysis, there was higher percentage of
unknowing Lifeline in Aborigines than in Hans
(77.8% vs. 55.3%). The main reasons for not using
Lifeline in non-users were the costs and lack of
perceived need. There were 81.8% and 68.1%
subjects considered that videophones and cell
phone or internet informed services will be the part
of Tele-Care in the future.
The government should strengthen the an-
nouncement of Lifeline, especially in Aboriginal
areas through community resources. In order to
improve the effect of Lifeline, the perceived need
of elderly people living alone should be strengthen
and the compliance of subjects should be raised.

I. INTRODUCTION
Number of elder adults (65 years of age and older)
continues to grow in Taiwan, as the same in the
world. Solitude is a risk on non-intention death for
anyone, not only for older adult or suffers chronic
disease patients, but also seniors with chronic
diseases. In Taiwan, falls are the seventh leading
cause of death in people over the age of 65, but are
the second leading cause of accident death. Usu-
ally the consequences of fall are injuries, poor
outcome of hip fracture, fear fall and admission to
nursing home. As stated in some papers, more than
half of falls can be prevented. It will through four
stages to achieve this dwelling fall prevention.
I. Fall and recurrent falls prevalence survey
The First stage, we survey all the subject of elderly
people who aged at or above 65 and living at
Jhuosi county in Hualien which including seven
villages. Structural questionnaire were applied to
explore prevalence of fall and recurrent falls in
past one year, the circumstances of falling.
II. Identify fall related risk factors for static in-
formation
The Second stage, we selected three villages with
higher falls prevalence for further falls related risk
factors exploring. Matched case-control study and
structural questionnaire were used for identify
health and living environment as static informa-
tion.
III. Monitoring indoor living activities for dynamic
information
The third stage, passive infrared rays were used to
monitor indoor living activities. We set four de-
tectors in living room, bath room, kitchen room
and bedroom. When solitary senior walking indoor,
the infrared rays monitor core receive signal per 10
second and send the signal through blue tooth to
video phone then send to master terminal by wi-
4Third Year
Sampling: A cross sectional survey was chosen.
The framework of this study was according to
Andersen’s Health Behavior Model7. The subjects
of this study were included users and non-users.
Users were from the cases of LifeLine Service in
Mennonite Social Welfare Foundation, and
non-users were from the list of solitary elderly
people of Bureau of Social Affairs in Hualien.
After subjects agreed to participate, a home visit
was made for each subject by the author. A total of
91 users and 112 non-users aged 65 and over
completed the face-to-face interview in their
houses. Data collection took place between De-
cember 2006 and March 2007.
Questionnaires: A structured questionnaire de-
veloped by the author was used to collect the data.
The contents of the questionnaire included: (1)
Demographic data: such as age, gender, race,
education et al. (2) Social and family resources:
such as social welfare utilization, financial subsi-
dies and emergency contact et al. (3) Health status:
such as self-reported health status, medication and
fall experience et al. (4) Assessment of usage of
LifeLine: for users, the assessment included the
time of using, the way of applying, frequency of
button pressing actively, satisfaction and compli-
ance of the service. Compliance was defined as the
user wearing the portable button when alone at
home. Situations were classified as
fully-compliant, partially-compliant, or
non-compliant based on the time wearing the
portable button.“Fully-compliant”was defined as
wearing the portable button all the time while at
home. “Partially-compliant” was defined as
sleeping with the portable button within reach, but
not wearing it at other times.
“Non-compliant“was defined as never wearing
the portable button and never having it within
reach. For non-users, we assess the reasons for not
using LifeLine. (5) Needs of future development:
the current technology and instrument were used
to assess subjects needs for future development. (6)
IADLs: the categories of IADLs were ability to use
telephone, food preparation, housekeeping, shop-
ping, mode of transportation, responsibility for
own medication and the ability to handle finances.
Statistics:Data was analyzed using the SPSS sta-
tistical package via descriptive statistics and
chi-square test. An alpha value of p＜0.05 was
chosen as statistically significant.
Results
First and second years
We survey 545 seniors and complete 403 subjects
interview. Out of the 103 subjects experienced 224
times of fall. The prevalence of fall was 25.6%, the
recurrent falls prevalence was 13.4% (54 subjects)
(Figure 2). Most of the fall events took place
during daytime (91.1%) and outside (outside:
69.9%; inside: 30.1%) (Table 1). There was 46.6%
of subjects fell dizzy before falling down. Com-
pared with non-fallers, more fallers had higher
alcohol intake, not doing exercise, longer timed-up
& go-test, lower bedroom, total environmental
scores and more than one eyes diseases (p<0.05).
Among fall-related risk factors, adjusted odds ra-
tios of drinking more than 20g alcohol/day and
without doing exercise were 10.9
(95%CI=2.8-43.2) and 9.8 (95%CI=2.7-36.3) re-
spectively. The risk factors of recurrent falls were
poor vision, more lower limb joint diseases and
lower perception of health status.
The significant fall related risk factors were eye
disease amount, alcohol drinking status, physical
exercise habit, Timed Up and Go Test (TUGT)
and bedroom safety score. Furthermore, the sig-
nificant recurrent falls related risk factors were
vision status, knee joint disease and perceived
health status. The meaningful of this investigation
is to discover alcohol drinking status and bedroom
safety score are the most important risk factors of
fall and recurrent fall. We will put all the signifi-
cant risk factors to the intelligent fall risk assess-
ment and alarm system.
Discussion
The prevalence of community falls were 18.5% of
2403 and 21.2% of 2727 subjects respectively in
1999 and 2005 national elderly adult health survey,
both data were lower than this study.
There was a significant dose response between
daily alcohol intake and falls, this result was dif-
ferent from Lieu in 1993 (1) and Hwang in 1998 (2)
6or cell phone sending service (60.1%), for they can
decrease loneliness of solitary elderly persons and
increase the sense of safety.
Discussion
The most important factors affecting the use
of telecare are economic and health status. Previ-
ous studies found that elderly persons with poor
health and economic status were likely to use so-
cial welfare services or long-term care ser-
vices 5 - 7 . In this study, users had more chronic
diseases than non-users, such as diabetes mellitus,
heart disease and hypertension. Instead of imme-
diate impact of these diseases on subjects, the
complications would cause them at potential risk.
A study of people found down in their homes re-
vealed that elderly persons living alone were the
high risk group of such accidents 8 . As a result, it is
important to ensure the safety and to increase the
independence of elderly persons living alone.
In Taiwan, aborigines live in remote areas
and have insufficient medical resources. Besides,
their health status are worse than Han people. They
would be more helpless when accidents occur. The
results showed that 77.8% of aboriginal subjects
were unaware of LifeLine service. The rate was
significantly higher than Han subjects. There is
much demand of telecare in aborigines than in Han
people. However, it is underutilized. Previous
study found that the barriers of long-term care use
in aboriginal community were unawareness and no
access to services. In additional, expensive costs
and no demand of services by themselves were
also important reasons 9 . It is the same with our
results. The government should strengthen the
publicity of services in aboriginal areas. Moreover,
the authority should make appropriate subsidy
system. For the present LifeLine services, im-
proving the gap of communication is most im-
portant. There should be professional translators in
the call center at any time and training programs
about different cultures for operators.
The development of telecare in the future is
not only high-technological but human-based. It is
important that providers should offer services ac-
cording to different demands of subjects. More-
over, convenience and comfort are the main con-
sideration of design. In our study, the compliance
of wearing portable button is very low. It would
lower the effect of telecare and waste the service.
Therefore, how to improve this situation is worthy
of consideration.
III. CONCLUSION
In this paper, applied the epidemiology fall related
data as static information such as health status,
environment safety score, mobile ability to a in-
telligent fall risk assessment and alarm system,
that uses wiimax, Bluetooth and software agent
techniques to monitor solitary senior living activ-
ity as dynamic data. However, the considerations
of subjects are more important. Through data col-
lection and analysis to recognize the fall potential
event and to further treat the unusual condition
then predictable prevented falls. The proposed
system ultimately aims to enhance the quality of
life of the solitary seniors.
Self evaluation
We will complete two related academic papers in
coming months. The result of this study will pro-
vide to the health professionals to do solitude sen-
iors fall prevention intervention in the community.

一、參加會議經過
本會議是由 International Union for Health Promotion and Education 所主辦，每三年一
次，每次接吸引全球一萬多人參加，十多個國家參展，今年在加拿大溫哥華舉行。台灣
包括海報及口頭發表估計約有十多篇發表，政府單位由衛生署國民健康局領軍率領八位
同仁前往參展及發表論文。其他鄰近國家包括韓國、日本、泰國、印尼、香港皆有擺設
攤位展示每個國家針對健康促進所做的努力，例如戒菸計畫、動態生活計畫、兒童營養
衛教計畫、健康促進學校計劃、老人防跌計畫、心理衛生計畫(自殺、情緒管理)等，上
千篇的文章，上千個單元可以讓不同領域的人盡情參加此次以學術為主的健康促進嘉年
華會。下一屆 2010 年將在香港舉辦，因為離台灣較近，應該鼓勵國內衛生領域的學者盡
可能參加。
本次會議有五天，主軸以渥太華憲章的五大行動綱領為架構，包括建立健康的公共
政策、建立健康的環境、強化社區的行動力、增強個人的技巧及調整健康服務的方向，
每天早上有兩個鐘頭針對一個行動綱領為主題提出深入的探討，然後是針對不同議題分
組的討論會及發表會，相關的議題有原住民健康、健康促進學校、新興傳染病、社區介
入及參與、老人跌倒、事故傷害防治、糖尿病控制、老年人、兒童、婦女、健康素養、
運動促進等，有以對象為議題，有以政策為議題，五花八門玲瑯滿目。
二、與會心得
本次研討會因為分成很多議題，健康不平等、原住民健康在國際是最近很重要的議
題，因此在我發表的研究上也很切他們的主題，而以口頭報告方式發表，在原住民老人
跌倒上這次並沒有人跟我一樣有相同的主題，而原住民跌倒盛行率會較高的原因有過度
飲酒、沒有運動及環境不佳，而飲酒的因素在一般人老人的研究較少被提及，因此我的
報告內容也引發大家的討論。
今年是我第一次參加這一個研討會，但是整體而言場地器材的選擇都很不錯，唯主
辦單位在議題分類時的統整性並不好，相同的議題有時不知為何拆成兩個會議廳同時舉
辦，讓人不知該參與哪一場，例如我要發表的老人跌倒研究被編在世故傷害的政策討論，
但是同時另有一個專題針對老人跌倒進行討論，這種情形頗嚴重的，這種現象也被很多
