scalar of impact effect.  Therefore, force sensor and motion 
sensor consisted of accelerometers and gyroscopes are 
considerable components designed for a big humanoid robot. 
In this paper, a big humanoid robot is designed and 
implemented.  Particularly, force sensor and motion sensor 
consisted of accelerometers and gyroscopes for closed-loop 
control is designed in the humanoid robot for close-loop 
control. 
2. Mechanical Design of a Big Humanoid Robot 
In this section, how to design a big humanoid robot is 
described.  The kinematics of the designed humanoid robot is 
derived.  In addition, the kinematic equation is verified by 
joint trajectory calculation for a walking step. 
The mechanical design considers the minimum Degree Of 
Freedom (DOF) to let a humanoid robot have smooth 
walking.  Therefore, one leg and one hand are consisted of 6 
DOFs and 3 DOFs, respectively.  In addition, there are two 
DOFs designed for its head to move camera.  Fig. 1 shows 
the DOFs of every joint of the designed humanoid robot. 
The kinematics is important for walking gait planning and 
controller design.  The following thus derives the kinematic 
equation of the designed humanoid robot.  In traditional 
method, humanoid robots usually derive forward kinematic 
equations in geometric space.  Although the solution of using 
geometric space is comprehensive, vector method that is easy 
to derive robot dynamics is engaged in this paper.

where Ri (for i = 1, …, 8) are the links of the humanoid robot. 
In order to demonstrate the derive kinematic equations, we 
draw the humanoid robot in initial pose by using MATLAB.  
Fig. 2 shows the result of the humanoid robot at an initial 
pose in actual mechanical dimensions.  This result 
demonstrates that the kinematic equation is correct.

structure components for in the humanoid robot.  In addition, 
the head includes two COM cameras for 3-D image 
processing in the future. 
However, it is hard to control for such big humanoid robot 
due to heavy dynamics.  Usually, a big humanoid robot needs 
extra sensors to take care of its dynamic signals.  Therefore, 
the sensors including force.  Therefore, the accelerometers 
and gyroscopes are designed and dynamic sensors, but the 
force sensors are designed as static sensors for the humanoid 
control.  Both dynamic and static sensors feedback the 
walking dynamics to form the closed-loop control during the 
walking gait.

3. Sensor Installation 
Sensors are vital components in a big humanoid robot.  This 
section describes the sensors designed for the big humanoid 
robot.  The description of the sensors includes their 
composing and calibration. 
In order to capture the big humanoid robot dynamics during 
motion, the sensors for static and dynamic motion are 
respectively designed.  The static sensor consists of four 
strain gauges, and the dynamic motion sensor is designed by 
one three axes accelerometer and three one-axis gyroscopes.  
First, the static sensor is depicted in the following. 
Four strain gauges build the force sensors designed on the 
bottom of soles.  As shown in Fig. 7, the part to take strain 
signals is covered by rubber to avoid breaking the gauge 
during sole on the ground.  However, the rubbers result in 
different response among four strain gauges even if they 
share force.  The difference needs to be calibrated for 
consistent response.  Let a measure set be {(xi, yi), for i = 
1, …, n}, where xi is the voltage measured from the strain 
gauges at i-th try, and yi is the given force pushing on the 
strain gauges at i-th try.  Then a strength line can be used to 
approximate the measured set as follows 
y = ax + b (2) 
where x the voltage measured from the strain gauges, and y is 
the estimate force. 
Let the error between the measured force and estimated force 
be 
ei = y – yi = (axi +b) – yi 
Thus, the sum of square error is 
∑∑ −+==
i
2
ii

The optimal estimator is the solution of parameters a and b in 
Eq. (2) so that the sum of square error in Eq. (3) is minimum.  
The minimum of mean square error should satisfy

In order to have the minimum of square error, the parameters 
a and b can be solved by the following lemma.

cycloid equation to solve the joint trajectories of the big 
humanoid robot is also included. 
The humanoid robot employs cycloid equation as walking 
pattern.  The cycloid equation depicted as Fig. 10 for the 
humanoid robot walking pattern expresses one step walking 
as follows (for 0 ≤ t ≤ t1):

where t1 is the period of one walking step, a1 is one half of a 
walking stride, and h is the height of the walking stride.

walking pattern. 
 
Fig. 11. The trajectories of sole and waist. 
The benefit of cycloid trajectory is uniform speed, i. e. 
constant acceleration.  In theory, the uniform speed lets the 
humanoid robot don’t have sliding force during waling.  This 
result can be examined by calculating the double differential 
of x(t) and z(t) in Eqs. (9) and (10). 
Two cycloid equations designed for sole and waist 
trajectories form the walking pattern of the humanoid robot.  
After solving the inverse kinematics from forward kinematics 
Eqs. (1), two cycloid equations can solve the trajectories of 
all joints of the humanoid robot.  Fig. 11 shows the sole and 
waist trajectories.  Note that the red curve is the half 
trajectory for the humanoid robot in initial walking posture. 
5.  Conclusions 
In this paper, a low cost big humanoid robot is designed and 
implemented.  The forward and inverse kinematics are 
derived for motion planning and control.  Two cycloid 
equations designated as sole and waist trajectories consist of 
the walking pattern of the big humanoid robot.  In addition, 
two kinds of sensors, force and motion are designed for static 
and dynamic sensor in the big robot.  In the future, the 
dynamic walking patterns will be launched based the sensors 
to compose the closed-loop humanoid control for robust 
walking.
