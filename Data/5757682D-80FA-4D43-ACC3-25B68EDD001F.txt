摘要 
 革蘭氏陰性菌之雙精胺酸轉位路徑（Tat）因可分泌具有輔因子之摺疊蛋白質至細
胞間質，因此在以大腸桿菌為宿主表現基因重組蛋白質的應用上具有相當之潛力。然而
由於 Tat 系統之轉為效率遠低於 Sec 系統，因此其發展應用一直受到限制。在本研究中

Secretion of recombinant proteins into the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria such as 
E. coli may be advantageous for the characteristic features associated with the physiological 
environments of the periplasm, which could lead to higher yields of folded heterologous 
proteins with authentic N-termini [1]. The recovery and purification of secreted, periplasmic 
proteins can also be greatly facilitated by selectively breaking the outer membrane without 
rupturing the cytoplasmic membrane [2]. Furthermore, the secretion of enzymes into the 
periplasm can also be exploited for the development of whole-cell biocatalysts. A significant 
reduction in mass transfer resistance and thus enhancement in the rates of biotransformation 
can be achieved by translocating the enzymes into the periplasm or onto the surface of outer 
membrane of E. coli [3]. 
The secretion of proteins in E. coli is generally carried out via the well-characterized Sec 
pathway [4]. An alternative system, the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway, has been 
identified in bacteria for the secretion of the periplasmic cofactor-containing proteins [5-9]. 
Proteins secreted via the Tat pathway are found to be guided by signal peptides exhibiting 
characteristic SRRxFLK motifs located at the boundary between the polar n-regions and the 
hydrophobic h-regions [10]. Because of the Tat pathway’s ability to translocate multisubunit, 
cofactor-containing proteins in folded states, the potential biotechnological applications of the 
Tat pathway for protein secretion have enticed further research interests. Previous studies

DmsD might play a similar role in escorting proteins with DmsA (dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) 
reductase) signal peptide and thus enhancing translocation as TorD does with the TorA signal 
peptide [23]. In this study, we present data supporting this hypothesis and further demonstrate 
the possible cross-activity between DmsD and TorD with the Tat signal peptides of TorA and 
DmsA. 
 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1 Bacterial strains, plasmids and growth conditions 
E. coli strain MC 4100 (F- araD139 △(argF-lac)U169 flbB5301 deoC1 ptsF25 relA1 
rbsR22 rpsL150 thiA, courtesy of Dr. Georgiou of the University of Texas, USA) was used 
throughout this study [28]. Plasmids and their features used in this study are summarized in 
Table 1. Plasmids pTGS and pDGS, harboring genes encoding ssTorA::GFP::SsrA and 
ssDmsA::GFP::SsrA, respectively, are also a gift from Dr. Georgiou. Plasmid pSU-TorD, 
harboring gene encoding TorD under the regulation of tat promoter, was a gift from Dr. 
Sargent of the University of East Anglia, UK [23]. Plasmid pLac-TorD, harboring gene 
encoding TorD under the regulation of lac promoter, was constructed as previously reported 
[23]. To construct a recombinant plasmid harboring dmsD gene under the regulation of lac 
promoter, the gene dmsD encoding DmsD was amplified from pTDMS67 [29] by polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) with oligonucleotide primers 5'-CgC AgT TCT AgA AAg AAg gAg

The cell suspension was subsequently incubated at room temperature for 1h. The periplasmic 
fraction was collected in the supernatant by centrifugation at 3000 x g for 15 min. The 
spheroplasts collected as pellets were resuspended in SET solution (20% sucrose and 50 mM 
EDTA in 50 mM pH 8.0 Tris-HCl buffer) and lysed by sonication. 
 
2.3 Western blotting analysis 
Western blotting was performed according to the method [32]. The following primary 
antibodies were used: monoclonal mouse anti-GFP (Clonetech) diluted 1:5,000, polyclonal 
rabbit anti-GroEL (Sigma) diluted 1:10,000, polyclonal rabbit anti-β-lactamase (Chemicon) 
diluted 1:2,500, anti-T7 tag (Novagen) diluted 1:5,000, and polyclonal rabbit anti-TorD 
(courtesy of Dr. Sargent) diluted 1:10,000. Goat anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase and goat 
anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoReserach, USA) diluted 1:10,000 were 
used accordingly as the secondary antibodies.  
 
2.4 Fluorescence analysis  
Fluorescence intensities of the E. coli suspensions after the induction of GFP expression 
were followed for up to 6 h with 0.002% L-arabinose at 507 nm excited at 488 nm [33]. For 
some experiments, as indicated in Results and Discussion, the E. coli cells grown at 37 oC 
were harvested 4 h after the induction of GFP expression by centrifugation at 4000 x g for 5

sequence to GFP guides the fusion protein toward rapid proteolysis by cytoplasmic proteases 
ClpXP and ClpAP [34, 35] and that GFP translocated via the Sec pathway does not fold 
correctly in the periplasm and thus does not show fluorescence activity [36]. To confirm the 
feasibility of this reporter system, confocal fluorescence microscopy analysis of the whole 
cells and spheroplasts of E. coli expressing the ssDmsA::GFP::SsrA fusion was performed. In 
cells at the early induction phase the SsrA-mediated degradation of the fusion proteins might 
be masked by the continuing expression of the said fusion. To more accurately employ 
fluorescence as a measure of GFP translocation and folding, the recombinant cells were 
collected 4 hours after induction with L-arabinose, and were subsequently resuspended in 
fresh inducer-free medium to the same optical density. Whole cells and spheroplasts obtained 
at defined intervals were then examined with confocal fluorescence microscope. As shown in 
Fig. 1(a), the E. coli spheroplasts were clearly visible under the microscope at the onset of the 
incubation. However, as the incubation proceeded, the fluorescence intensity of the 
spheroplasts declined rapidly, presumably due to the SsrA-mediated proteolysis of cellular 
GFP and the external loss of translocated GFP. After 6 hours from initial induction, the 
spheroplasts lossed essentially all the fluorescence. Although decline in fluorescence 
intensity was also observed in E. coli whole cells, Fig. 1(b), the presence of fluorescent cells 
was still evident at the 6 hour time point after the onset of the incubation. Polar emission of 
fluorescence was evident in the cells similar to what had been observed by Santini et al., [37]

3.2 Coexpression of DmsD  
To investigate the effect of DmsD overexpression on the translocation of 
ssDmsA::GFP::SsrA fusion via the Tat pathway, a recombinant plasmid, pLac-DmsD, 
harboring the gene encoding DmsD under the regulation of lac promoter was constructed. 
The fluorescence intensities of the recombinant E. coli cells resuspended in fresh inducer-free 
medium were monitored. As shown in Fig. 3, at the onset of the incubation the recombinant E. 
coli co-expressing DmsD exhibited higher fluorescence intensity than the control, indicating 
a higher total folded GFP concentration in the cell. The high fluorescence intensity might be a 
result of enhanced GFP expression, reduced GFP proteolysis, and/or reduced GFP inclusion 
body formation. However, since we have previously shown that the coexpression of TorD [23] 
in E. coli does not enhance the synthesis of the GFP fusion, the effect of DmsD coexpression 
on the expression of GFP fusion can be ruled out. Furthermore, since it has been reported that 
DmsD recognizes and binds to the signal peptide of DmsA [39], we postulate that the high 
fluorescence intensity exhibited by the recombinant cells co-expressing DmsD can be 
attributed to the reduced rate of proteolysis and/or inclusion body formation in the cytoplasm 
mediated by the binding of DmsD to the DmsA signal peptide. As the incubation continued 
the fluorescence intensity of the whole cells decreased rapidly, due to the SsrA-mediated

of the GFP fusion. The fluorescence intensity of the cells with DmsD coexpression was more 
than three-fold higher than that of the control after 6 hours, supporting the chaperone activity 
of DmsD against proteolysis and/or aggregation. 
 
3.3 Cross-activity study 
 Since it has been reported that DmsD and TorD exhibit high sequence homology and 
that DmsD binds TorA signal peptide [25 – 27, 40], we postulate that there might be certain 
cross-activity between DmsD and TorD. To verify this hypothesis, a cross-activity study was 
conducted, in which the effect of DmsD coexpression on the translocation of the 
ssTorA::GFP::SsrA fusion was evaluated. As shown in Fig. 6, coexpression of DmsD did 
enhance the translocation of the ssTorA:;GFP::SsrA fusion. The final fluorescence intensity 
of the cells co-expressing DmsD is 15 ± 5 % higher than that of the control.  
 The cross-activity observed is in contrast to Iobbi-Nivol and coworkers’ finding that 
DmsD and TorD are specific to the corresponding molybdopartners [40].  However, it is 
consistent with Turner and coworkers’ previous results suggesting that DmsD binds to both 
preDmsA and preTorA [25]. The results here show the level of enhancement of 15 %, with 
DmsD coexpression with ssTorA:;GFP::SsrA fusion is lower than that obtained with the 
ssDmsA::GFP::SsrA fusion, 28 %. This is by no means unexpected, as the binding affinity of 
DmsD for the TorA vs the DmsA signal peptide are different.  Overall the difference in

Western blotting analysis on cytoplasmic inclusion bodies was also performed to investigate 
the effect of chaperone coexpression on the formation and prevention of GFP inclusion 
bodies. As shown in Fig. 8 (b), the coexpression of DmsD resulted in a significant reduction 
in the level of ssDmsA::GFP:SsrA inclusion body formation, lane 2. The intensities of bands 
that could be attributed to the degradation products of the GFP fusion were also much lower 
than those of the control, lane 1. Similar results were also observed for cells expressing 
ssTorA::GFP::SsrA, Fig. 8 (b), lanes 4 & 5. As expected the extent of reduction in inclusion 
body formation was not as significant, because the cross-activity of DmsD on the TorA signal 
peptide was lower as described above. This result suggests that the coexpression of DmsD 
could prevent the aggregation of ssDmsA::GFP::SsrA and ssTorA::GFP::SsrA, giving more 
folded GFP fusions available for translocation. However, coexpression of TorD did not to 
lead to a significant reduction in the formation of ssDmsA::GFP:SsrA inclusion bodies, as the 
profile and band intensity of the Western blotting analysis on inclusion bodies of the cells 
coexpressing TorD, lane 3, is essentially identical to that of the control. Thus the apparent 
enhancement in the translocation of ssDmsA::GFP:SsrA with TorD coexpression, cannot be 
accounted for via this mechanism. The results here support the earlier suggestion that TorD 
enhances protein translocation by reducing proteolysis via its binding toward the signal 
peptide [23], However DmsD may provide the additional role of prevention against 
aggregation.

reported in the literature [40], our results do show that both TorD and DmsD are effective in 
enhancing protein translocations with their natural signal peptides, ssTorA and ssDmsA, 
respectively. Overall it is clear that for recombinant protein production of secreated proteins 
that are unsuitable for the Sec system, that will be targeted to the Tat system, coexpression of 
twin arginine leader sequence binding chaperones are key to increased yields.
