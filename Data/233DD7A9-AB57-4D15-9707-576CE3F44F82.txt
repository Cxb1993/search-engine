II. Clarification of effectiveness of the case 
of “Smong” in Simelue island through 
literature review
 At the time of tsunami of 2004, residents of 
Simelue island, which is located very close to 
epicenter of the earthquake, had managed 
themselves to smoothly evacuate to higher 
land. Despite the shortage of time till tsunami 
impact, none of the residents were killed by the 
wave. Impact came faster than the 15 minutes 
of time required for wide range warning 
system, but traditional song named “smong” 
had saved their life. On 1907, tsunami had 
struck Simelue Island  and left huge damage to 
settlements. To pass down the memories and 
necessary action needs to be taken in case of 
tsunami, this song of smong was created. Local 
village people sing this song in every occasion 
of their daily life to keep refreshing their 
memories. Records notes that evacuation had 
started within 1 minutes after the earthquake. 
This phenomenon gives us very important hint. 
If residents can share the same knowledge as 
principle to determine their action, time taken 
to decide the action can be shortened compared 
to the warning system, which is designed with 
out supposing any knowledge to people.
III. Definition of norm and its effectiveness 
on tsunami disaster mitigation through 
literature review
 In case of earthquake strike, it is easy to 
expect people being discomposed and 
confused. In such case, there are chance that 
proper evacuation action may not be taken. Or 
even so, mob mind may lead people to run to 
the wrong direction.
 Under such tense situation, it is likely that 
complexed information may not be recalled by 
people. Also, information recorded on paper or 
any other physical media may not be referred 
at the moment of earthquake which brings 
destruction in and out of the building. As seen 
in the case of Simeulue, it shall be more 
effective for residents to share the principle 
defining the proper reaction to the situation. 
Such principle, usually called “norm”, is 
defined in various researches as followings.
　Norm is a principle of right action binding 
upon the members of a group and serving to 
guide, control, or to regulate proper and 
acceptable behavior. It became as a pattern or 
trait taken to be typical in the behavior of a 
social group which reflected characteristic of 
the community (Scharlette Holdman, 
Christopher Seeds, 2008).
　 A norm can be defined as “a standard of 
appropriate behavior for actors with a given 
identity (Martha Finnemore, Kathryn Sikkink, 
1998). 
　Norms are distinguished from ideas or 
beliefs, which do not have to be directly linked 
3
Problems over sharing and acting depending on 
age and physical ability
  Even one is native resident, their physical 
condition will effect the capability to handle 
norm. For example, infants do not understand 
norm itself. Adult migrants may not share 
norm, but once they understand the proper 
action, they may play important role in helping 
others evacuate. Native elderly or disabled 
people 
Media to expand knowledge in norm
 In order to transfer the knowledge within 
norm, only useful media is visual and audio 
information. Favorable visual information will 
be something very clear in expression such as 
pictogram due to the possibility of language 
barrier within viewers. Also, information 
distribution through audio mean should not be 
expelled since some visually disabled person 
may need it. 
 Population ratio among these criteria of people 
differs depending on the location of the region. 
Also, some of the facilities clearly have 
tendency in the ratio such as hospital or 
nursery school. Location of such facilities 
needs to be considered from beginning of the 
plan.
V. Clarification of investigation site through 
specification of the most dangerous area 
using overlaid maps
In order to clarify the effectiveness and limit of 
sharing norm, target site for spatial simulation 
must be chosen. Tsunami struck Banda Aceh 
roughly 50 minutes after the shake. Although 
there were relatively long time before the wave 
impact, this area had suffered severe human 
damage due to the lack of knowledge about 
tsunami in citizen. Also, around the time of 
tsunami strike, many citizens tried to evacuate 
using motorcycle and vehicles, causing 
massive traffic jam. Considering these 
phenomenons happened on site, following four 
criteria were selected to identify the 
settlements expected to have highest need of 
norm.
Distance from shore line
Figure 4. Overlay of maps
 The distance which tsunami have to travel on 
the land directly influence the time of its reach. 
Settlements close to shoreline and has no other 
settlements in between the shore are selected.
-Topography
 Hilly means there are many escaping 
destinations. In the low flat land, there is a 
need to construct escape building or evacuation 
plan using vehicle must be considered. Land 
with more than necessary height will have 
limited or no damage from tsunami. 
Settlements with flat and low topography are 
selected. 
-Population density
5
of the village is selected. Due to the tsunami, 
nearly 40 percent of the village area was 
washed away. Remaining settlements, 
indicated as A to D in the map, were 
investigated. 
 Alue naga village has population of 1,201 
according to the census of 2010. 
 Site survey and interview to residents were 
performed through February 16 to March 9 of 
2012. Interview were done face to face to the 
member of residence. data from 167 
respondents were earned. Beside their 
opinions, detailes of their family members 
were also asked, so including infants and 
children.
 Tsunami survivors are a little more in numbers 
compared to the natives in the village. This is 
because some of them did moved in to the 
village after suffering damage from tsunami in 
other settlements.
 At the time of last tsunami, many people had 
escaped to moque. It is true that many of 
mosque were durable to the wave and many 
people were saved. So it is not only the 
religious belief but based on experience that

Figure 7. Evacuation simulation by current condition
area is supposed to be changed to mangrove 
forests. This will be the bufferzone so once 
tsunami strikes this area again, the forest can 
decrease speed and impact of the wave. 
Residents do understand the meaning of this 
plan, so 46 percent did agree to change their 
village into mangrove forest if there are 
enough compensation. 
 We can see that one of the largest reason 
residents keep residing in this place is 
economical one. Even if Alu Naga village 
promote transfer of settlements to the future, 
currently there are definite need of norm for 
them. Though social connection in between 
native and migrants are getting even more 
weaker today, so there must be some re-
organization in local community.
VI. Conclusion
This research aimed to clarify the effectiveness 
of norm regarding the mitigation of tsunami 
disaster. Norm can contribute to the 
advancement of the evacuation. Though proper 
design over distribution of information is 
required for people with various background to 
evacuate for sure. Spatial simulation showed 
that norm gives more effect to the number of 
people evacuating instead of total time. There 
are need of enhancement of community in 
order to obtain information of the location of 
people with need of assistance to ensure the 
evacuation of entire village population. Reason 
for residing in this village is mainly the 
economical one. Social network in this village 
is getting weaker, likely to effect the 
information distribution process of norm.
 In order to improve the security of the 
villagers, beside the economical aid, 
community enhancement is strongly 
demanded. Also, further research is needed to 
clarify means to change information into 
shared norm.

Abstract—This research aims to clarify key landscape elements 
in tourist area and their effect to the regional image of visitors. 
Shengsing station area, Miaoli, Taiwan was chosen as a target 
site. Population density investigation was performed to figure 
out most important spots influencing the regional image in 
each tourist. By applying SD method analysis to the video clips 
taken at each spot, followings became clear.  1) There are 2 
adjectives (calmness and familiarity) representing the regional 
image. 2) Wood, brick, stone, green, and people are the top 5 
landscape elements appearing in this area. 3) Some elements 
and adjectives showed relation. Those are; wood – friendly, 
spirited; green – bright, spirited, cheerful. Results were 
verified by performing SD methods analysis to video clips 
created by computer graphic. 
Keywords-landscape element; regional image; SD method 
I. INTRODUCTION 
A.  Background 
 Under the pressure of the globalization, many regions in 
the world are suffering from demolishing local identities due 
to the homogenizing sense of values. Scale merit takes over 
the inter-city competition and large cities earn more 
superiority compared to small cities. This is leading to the 
depopulation of the rural area. Regional development of 
today strongly needs the incubation of industry taking full 
advantage of the features and characters of each city and 
region.  
Promotion of tourism industry would be one of such 
possibility. In order to gain attractiveness of the region, 
proper spatial design must be done so spatial experience of 
visitors properly contribute to the formation of regional 
image among them. 
This research will focus on the exterior public space of 
the tourism area to earn the fundamental knowledge over the 
urban space design to enhance the regional image. 
B. Purpose of this Research 
This research aims to clarify following 3 issues. 
 
1. Adjectives representing the regional image 
2. SW Dominant landscape elements in the region 
3. Relation between landscape elements and regional 
image 
C. Site Description 
The target site is surrounding area of Shengsing station, 
Sanyi, Miaoli. The station is located between Taipe city and 
Taichung city of Taiwan. This is the tourist place with many 
visitors especially on the weekend. Here runs a disused track 
of railway which now called as Old Mountain Line. Station 
building was built at 1912 and preserved till today. This line 
was disused from 1998 as new Taichung railway was 
constructed. On 2010, these facilities were re-opened as 
tourism specialized railway. This change had attracted many 
tourists and even further development is expected toward the 
future. In this area, there are total of 40 retails shops and 
restaurants. 30 residences were confirmed through site 
investigation. 
II. DENSITY INVESTIGATION OF THE TOURIST AROUND 
SHENGSING STATION 
Visual investigation was done from 10:00 to 16:00 of 
Sunday, May 8th, 2011 to earn the record of the location of 
National Science Council of Taiwan (NSC99-2218-E-239-001)

  half of their area is occupied by certain element were 
counted and recorded. (Figure 4, Table3) 
VI. RELATION BETWEEN LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS AND 
IMPRESSIONS 
Representing elements from each test were compared 
with frequently seen adjectives. All test having woods in its 
representative elements do have keywords of “friendly” and 
“spirited”. 6 out of 8 tests had green as their representative 
elements and adjectives “bright”, “spirited”, and “cheerful” 
appeared in 4 of these tests. By comparing the noted 
landscape and occupancy, it can be said that wooden surface 
of buildings and structures seems to have strong influence to 
feeling. Stone and brick did not show strong relation with 
image. People were most frequently noted element, but 
concerning the relation to adjectives, it did not give strong 
influence. (Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Figure 6) 
VII. VALIDATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE 
SPACE AND THE RATIO OF ELEMENTS OF LANDSCAPE 
 To validate the result earned from previous analysis, 
computer graphic movies were prepared for the experiment. 
Here, buildings in the townscape are simplified into boxes. 
For each element of wood, brick, and stone, buildings are 
mapped with each material. For each element of green and 
people, building surfaces were remained white and each 
element were placed on the street using photograph image. 
Experiments were performed with same manner as previous 
one. Number of examinee was 10. (Figure 5)
