control (I.D. = 0.25 mm, same as the rest connecting tubing) for
various protein concentrations. It seems that there is not much
difference in the patterns of aggregate formation for the con-
traction and the control cases. On the contrary, for the cases
of expansion (Fig. 2b, I.D. = 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 mm), the patterns
look very different from those shown in Fig. 2a. Specifically, the
appearance of the additional aggregate peaks (the third peaks)
was significantly noted for the case of I.D. = 1.0 mm and 20 g/l,
the out-of-range one, as well as others in Fig. 2b. The formation
of the third peak may attribute to the expansion of sample loops.
The effect became significant with high expansion coefficient
(diameter ratio of sample loop to connecting tubing) and protein
concentration.
3.2. Effect of injection volume on total amount of
aggregates before the column inlet
The experimental data of Figs. 1 and 2 were integrated as
the indication of aggregate amount. And the total amount of
aggregates (including all the peaks) for each case is plotted
as a function of injection volume in Fig. 3 for either differ-
ent lengths or different diameters of sample loops. The results
of this figure seem to suggest that the total aggregate amount
was not dependent on the sample loop dimension (diameter or
length), but instead, influenced by injection volume and pro-
tein concentration. For lower protein concentrations up to 10 g/l,
the aggregation increased with the increasing sample volume
to some saturation values. However, for the case of 20 g/l, the
saturation was not reached under our experimental conditions

Joint Symposium SPICA 2006
In order to maximise the knowledge synergies and cross dis-
cipline capabilities that exist between bioseparation and chemi-
cal separation in terms of the latest application developments,
in 2006 the scientific programme of ISPPP will encompass a
joint day dealing with fields and themes of common interest in
association with SPICA. SPICA is the highly renowned
International Symposium on Preparative and Industrial
Chromatography, and will hold its conference just before
ISPPP 2006 on 15 – 18 October 2006 in the same location in
Innsbruck. Both scientific committees have decided to organise
a joint day dealing with the overlapping aspects of process
scale separations, including scaling-up tools and principles,
use of adaptive expert systems in process manufacturing, 
fundamentals of multicomponent separations in batch, column
and SMB modes, and case study applications: 
Connecting between Systems Design and 
Process Modelling for large and small Molecules
This joint symposium day will occur on Wednesday, 18 October
2006, with the morning sessions emphasising specific attributes
of the large scale separation of low molecular weight com-
pounds and the afternoon sessions devoted to high molecular
weight bioproducts. It will thus deal with key specific aspects
of advanced separation technologies and their application. 
In the remaining days of the ISPPP conference, the value gene-
rating aspects of new technologies and advances in biopro-
cess operations as applied to biomolecules will be dealt within
a comprehensive manner. The use of new analytical tools and
recent developments in the fundamental processes involved in
molecular interaction and motion will form key sessions. The
ISPPP 2006 meeting will thus provide key information relevant
to all sectors of the bioseparation community and is thus a
major conference that you should not miss!!!!
Because of the value of this conference to your research or
work environment within your organisation please make a note
immediately in your diary of the dates of ISPPP 2006 – 17 - 20
October 2006 – and plan to attend this important conference
in Innsbruck. The Organising Committee looks forward to wel-
come you to ISPPP 2006 and your participation in a dynamic
and significant scientific programme. You will be highly satisfied
that you did!!!

Abstract
Protein aggregation is a ubiquitous phenomenon significant to all aspects of 
science.  Notably, the formation of protein aggregates is frequently encountered in 
biochemical research and biopharmaceutical industry. Formation of protein 
aggregates is generally regarded to be associated with partially folded intermediate 
species that are susceptible to self-association due to the exposure of hydrophobic 
core. Evidence supports the concept that the formation of aggregates in vitro is a 
generic property of proteins. In human etiology, more than twenty different 
devastating human diseases have been reported to be associated with protein 
aggregation. Although protein aggregation diseases have been the center of intense 
research, much remains to be learned regarding the underlying molecular 
mechanism(s).
In this review, the general background information on protein aggregation is first 
provided. Next, we summarize the properties, characteristics, and causes of protein 
aggregates.  Finally, from the perspectives of epidemiology, pathogenesis, existing 
mechanisms, relevant hypotheses, and current as well as potential therapeutic 
approaches, two examples of protein aggregation diseases, Alzheimer’s disease and 
cataract, are briefly discussed.  Importantly, while a variety of molecules have been 
suggested, the effective therapeutic drugs for curing the diseases involving protein 
aggregation have yet to be identified.  We believe that a better understanding of the 
mechanisms of protein aggregation process and an extensive investigation into the 
drug penetration, efficacy, and side-effects will certainly aid in developing the
successful pharmacological agents for these diseases.

amyloidosis, type II diabetes, Parkinson disease, Huntington’s disease, Alzheimer’s 
disease, cataract, and sickle cell disease (see Table 1) [10,17,18,19,20].  Interestingly, 
these diseases individually have their distinctive clinical, pathological, and 
biochemical characteristics and their corresponding precursor proteins have unrelated 
functions and lack any significant sequence homology.  Nevertheless, the underlying 
mechanism involving the transformation of a native functional protein into an aberrant 
structure is a common feature shared by these disease processes [17,18,19,20].
Cause, Characteristics, and Detection of Protein Aggregates
In general, protein aggregates are generated due to the structural reorganization of 
native proteins.  A growing body of evidence has suggested that the formation of 
partially folding or unfolding intermediates represents a crucial prerequisite for 
protein aggregation [17,21,22].  These partially folding/unfolding intermediates have 
loosely packed three-dimensional structure and are susceptible to 
aggregation/self-assembly owing to the exposure of hydrophobic core that serves as a 
binding site for other partially folded molecules [17,23,24,25]. As the bounded 
molecules accumulate at these sit s, the size of the protein assemblies gradually 
increases [24,25]. Evidence showed that the mechanism of protein aggregation is 
described as a process of nucleation followed by elongation and growth [26,27,28,29]. 
Results from past studies showed that the aggregation behavior of proteins can be 
altered by a number of factors including: (1) external/environmental factors: protein 
concentration, temperature, presence of salt, metal ion concentration, type of 
dissolving solvent, and pH of solution and (2) internal/structural factors: 
hydrophobicity, -sheet secondary structure content [10,20,30,31].  Furthermore, an 
enhanced aggregation was observed via the glycation process in which proteins are 
cross-linked with carbohydrates under oxidizing conditions [32,33,34].  It should be
noted that, despite significant progress has been made, there are still large gaps in our 
knowledge of the mechanism(s) and pathways involved in the protein aggregation
process.
The characteristics and ultra-structure of aggregated species can vary considerably 
depending upon the conditions under which they are formed. In general, protein 
aggregates can be categorized into two types: amorphous/disordered aggregates 
without long-range order, and amyloid fibrils with highly ordered structural makeup.  
The amorphous/disordered aggregates have multiple forms and lack distinct 
intermolecular interactions.  An example of such aggregates is the non-specific 
inclusion bodies found in host cells over-expressing cloned proteins. The structure 
of amyloids is recognized to possess several specific tinctorial and physicochemical 
features in common: exhibition of -sheet rich secondary structure, fibrillar

age and accounting for 25% of cases and late-onset (‘senile’) dementia [48].  The 
disease is also divided into familial and sporadic forms of disease according to family 
history. Early-onset familial cases make up 10% of all AD patients while late-onset 
familial cases make up 30% of all AD patients (American Health Assistance 
Foundation, 2007). Early-onset AD has been clearly shown to be genetic in origin. 
While a mutation on chromosome 19 (where the ApoE gene is located) has been 
found to be highly correlated with late-onset AD (the most common form), not 
everyone having the mutation develops the disease.  The mutation of amyloid 
precursor protein (APP) on chromosome 21 is linked to early-onset AD [49,50], while 
presenilin 1 (PS1) gene (chromosome 14) and presenilin 2 (PS 2) gene (chromosome 
1) are responsible for 50% of early-onset familial AD [50].  Aside from genetics, 
studies have suggested that a variety of non-genetic factors, for example, oxidative 
stress, metal, cholesterol level, head injury, vascular diseases, and ethnicity are 
suspected to be associated with AD [47].
Pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s Disease
The characteristic histopathological signatures of AD include extracellular senile 
plaques containing -amyloid peptide (A), intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles
composed of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, cerebrovascular amyloid deposits, 
neuronal damage, and loss of synapses [51]. The question of which proteins are the 
main culprits responsible for the neuropsychiatric manifestation of AD has been 
greatly debated and so far, two proteins, -amyloid peptide and tau, claim the majority 
of the votes.
Pathologically, a strong correlation between the dementia experienced by patients 
in life and the amyloid burden detected upon autopsy was concluded in some careful 
studies [52].  Although, up to date, the precise cause of AD and the mechanisms 
leading to the formation of these abnormal protein clusters remain unclear, they are 
believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. It is widely believed that the 
conversion of A into amyloid deposits is a causative event in the molecular 
pathogenesis of AD. The so-called amyloid hypothesis is considered the most 
prevalent and widely accepted theory regarding the cause and origin of AD and has 
been buttressed by numerous lines of evidence in animal model, pathological, genetic, 
epidemiological, and in vitro cell culture studies.  Generation of amyloid deposits 
similar to AD pathology and neuronal death in the brains were observed in transgenic 
mice with overexpression of APP or fragments of APP carrying familial AD mutations 
[53,54].  Genetic mutations, which cause the familial AD, result in a rise in A
production [54,55,56]. The activation of microglia and significant loss of neurons 
were associated with the presence of fibrillar A or A deposits [57,58].

with the species that are part of the A accumulation or aggregation process.
Structural Properties of A
The sequence of monomeric A peptides can be generally split into four clusters, 
two hydrophobic segments from 17-21 and 29-42, and two hydrophilic segments from 
1-16 and 22-28.  Two turns are predicted between residues 6 and 8, and residues 23 
and 27 [83,84].  The conformation of A has been suggested to be the key 
determinant of structure changes in the peptide that would accompany the aggregation 
process [85,86,87]. As opposed to -helix and random coil, the -sheet secondary 
structure has been found to be closely correlated with insolubility and protease 
resistance [88,89].  Generally, soluble A species has predominately a random coil 
or -helical structure, aggregated A species adopts a higher degree of -sheet 
content, which has been suggested to correlate with neurotoxicity of A [90]. The 
conformation of A has proven to be exquisitely sensitive to its environmental factors,
including ionic strength, temperature, concentration, pH, and solvent components (see 
Table 3).
A Aggregation Process
A is secreted as a monomer in vivo.  Under either in vivo or in vitro
environment, A spontaneously self assembles into fibrils.  It has been shown that 
A aggregation process depends on pH of solution, temperature, A peptide 
concentration, the presence of salt, and mixing protocol [91,92,93].  Stable 
monomers of A can be formed, in vitro, by dissolving the peptide in 8M urea, 100% 
(v/v) DMSO, TFE, HFIP or in detergents such as SDS [94,95,96].  When dissolved 
in water, A is observed to undergo a random coil to -sheet conversion that can be 
controlled by temperature, pH, and peptide concentration [95,96].  At low 
temperatures (0°C), the transition to -sheet is not accompanied by dimerization or 
aggregation of the peptide [95].  At low concentrations (10 µM) and in 10% DMSO, 
formation of stable A dimers occurs [97].  Whether in water or physiological 
buffers, under higher concentrations and/or high temperature, reversible aggregation 
into higher molecular weight species may occur [95,98].  Moreover, the effect of 
dissolving solvents on the kinetic behavior of  aggregation was quantitatively 
analyzed [26].  It was found that the morphological feature of fibrils/aggregates 
formed was also dependent on the solvent type (see Figure 1) [26].
Several studies have focused on identifying particular amino acids that are critical 
to A aggregation.  Studies using variants with different C-termini showed that 
shorter C-terminus slowed the aggregation process [99,100].  It has been 
demonstrated that the central hydrophobic cluster region Leu17-Ala21 is important 
for -sheet formation as well as A aggregation [101,102,103,104].  Substitutions of 
two hydrophobic phenylalanine residues in positions 19 and 20 [102,105] or Lys16

Nucleation-Dependent Growth: In vitro work has led to the proposal of 
nucleation-dependent pathway in amyloid fibrillization [26,99,118,119].  This 
mechanism primarily involves three main steps: (1) a slow nucleation phase, in which 
A undergoes a series of thermodynamically unfavorable association steps to generate 
an ordered oligomeric nucleus, (2) a growth phase, involving the nucleus which 
readily grows to form larger polymeric species, and (3) a steady state phase, where the 
ordered aggregated species and the monomeric species are at equilibrium.  Results 
showed that no detectable turbidity was perceived after a few days (with a longer lag 
time) with A(1-39) or A(1-40) below the critical concentration, whereas A(1-42) 
solution with identical concentration formed aggregates or fibrils readily [120].  The 
elongation rate of A(1-40) was drastically enhanced and the aggregation kinetics of 
these fragments were observed to follow the first order kinetics as seeded with a trace 
of A(1-42) [105,121].  Moreover, the aggregation kinetics of A(1-40) and 
A(1-42), alone and in combination, were tremendously different [122].  The 
aggregation rate of A(1-42) was retarded by adding monomeric A(1-40) as 
compared with A(1-42) alone.  However, the mixture of A(1-40) and A(1-42) 
was still aggregated faster than A(1-40), suggesting that aggregation kinetics was 
determined by A(1-40).
Micelle Formation: The micelle formation hypothesis was proposed to describe 
the A aggregation [123].  They found that A displayed properties commonly 
associated with surfactants or detergents that form micelle in solution and also 
lowered the surface tension of water.  Different degrees of reduction in surface 
tension were observed in various A analogs, depending on whether these analogs 
contained the hydrophobic residue 29-43. This model postulates that A peptide was 
organized into a “tubular micelle”, known as a hexagonal I type phase.  The polar 
domain, approximately the first 28 residues, formes the outer wall of the amyloid 
fibril, while the hydrophobic domain forms the inner wall surrounding the center of
the fibril [123].
Advanced Glycation Modification: Vitek et al. [124] postulated that the deposition 
and the accumulation of A in AD might be triggered by the formation of advanced 
glycation end products (AGEs), which have been implicated in amyloidogenesis of 
2-microglobulin associated with hemodialysis-assocaied amyloidosis [125].  The 
thioflavin T fluorescence results indicated that aggregation rate induced by 
AGE-A(1-40) was about ten times faster than that induced by preformed aggregated 
A(1-40).  Based on this AGE modification model, A aggregation can be induced 
by chemical modification of the peptide.
While numerous models have been proposed, the great detail of the aggregation

by assembly of A.
Generation of ROS could be associated with increased intracellular concentration 
of Ca2+ [140,141].  It was reported that the exposure of rat hippocampal neurons or 
synaptosomes to A led to a reduction in Ca2+-ATPase activity.  The decline in 
ATPase activity in cultured neurons closely paralleled the rise in [Ca2+]i.  Impairment 
of the Ca2+ pumps from cells would lead to a loss of intracellular ion gradient, 
depolarization of the membrane, and increase in concentration of intracellular Ca2+
[141,142].
Reactive oxygen species production may indeed be closely involved in the 
pathogenesis of AD [132,143,144]. Until further evidence can be found to support 
these results, there is still too much uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of the 
findings and their consistency with the pool of literature to consider the reactive 
oxygen species hypothesis of A-mediated toxicity an acceptable proposal.
Membrane Perturbation
The importance of the interaction(s) of most amyloid proteins including A with 
membranes has been drawing considerable attentions in the mechanism of 
A-induced neurotoxicity.  A variety of evidence demonstrates that plasma 
membrane may play a potential role, either by interaction with or perturbation by A, 
in the A-mediated neurotoxicity associated with AD [145,146,147,148]. A group of 
membrane proteins were reported to bind A and the various effects of A binding to 
these membranes were also discussed [147].
A was shown to decrease the membrane fluidity in a concentration-dependent
manner [149,150].  Immunostaining of cultured neurons incubated with A by 
antibodies to A(1-40) clearly depicted aggregates at the plasma membrane [150].  
Subsequent study suggested that the longer A fragments had greater impact on 
membrane fluidity than the shorter fragments under the same condition.  The effect 
of A on the fluidity of phospholipid bilayer was observed to be greater in the 
hydrocarbon core than the hydrophilic heads [151].  Researchers examined the size 
of A species and its association with aggregation state, hydrophobicity, and changes 
in the membrane fluidity and concluded that the aggregation rate and surface 
hydrophobicity were strongly correlated with the extent of reduction in membrane 
fluidity measured in model lipid vesicles [152].  In addition, it has been observed 
that A perturbed membranes of rat, mouse, and human brain resulted in enhanced 
membrane-bound DPH anisotropy (inversely correlated with membrane fluidity)
[153].
On the contrary, other researchers reported a rise in membrane fluidities (annular 
or bulk) induced by A [154,155,156].  The lipid peroxidation was observed to be
correlated with the fluidizing action of A peptides [155].  The fluorescence

thorough exploration.
G-Protein Activation (GTP Hydrolysis)
It was suggested that G protein activation and other signal transduction events 
such as phospholipase D and adenylate cyclase activation are associated with the 
biological activity of A [169,170,171]. A report showed that G-protein activation 
and A aggregates were capable of upregulating tyrosine phosphorylation of focal 
adhesion kinase [172]. It was reported that the G protein and adenylate cyclase 
response to A was associated with A neurotoxicity [173]. A proposal has been 
made stating that the intracellular interaction between APP and G0 can be regulated 
by extracellular signals and the high-affinity G0 GTPase activity reduced upon 
incubating neuronal membranes with N-terminal APP recognition antibody [174].
It has been previously shown that aggregated A was able to increase GTP 
hydrolysis in cell membranes while inhibition of GTPase activity attenuated the 
toxicity of the A [175].  An A-induced increase in GTPase hydrolysis was 
observed with purified Gi and G0 alpha subunits reconstituted in liposomes, and with 
cell membranes in which the receptors had been proteolytically removed.  These 
results suggested that the G protein activation observed upon incubation with A was 
receptor-independent and was probably membrane-mediated. Later research 
indicated that the GTP-associated potentiation was found to be accompanied with the 
secondary structure of A peptide mixtures, revealing that structural alterations are 
behind the enhanced biological activity [176].
While the link between G protein activation and A actions was observed, the 
issue regarding how the activation of G protein occurs remains largely unclear. 
Kinetic analysis on A-induced GTP hydrolysis was utilized to explore this further
[177].  One mechanism that was proposed was that: first, A-G or A2-G was 
formed by binding between either one or two molecules of A and G protein.  A-G 
can then bind GTP to form a complex which will decompose to produce GDP and free 
phosphate.  However, further binding of A or aggregation on the surface inhibits 
binding of GTP [177].  While the nice match between rate expression and 
experimental data implies the above reaction scheme as one plausible molecular 
mechanism concerning A-induced G protein activation, further experiments are
warranted to assure the correctness of the aforementioned mechanism.
Role of Cell Membrane Composition in A-induced Neurotoxicity
Ample evidence indicates that the constituents of neuronal cell membrane (e.g.: 
cholesterol and gangliosides), either in the cell membrane or in culture medium, are 
essential to the mechanism of A toxicity. Studies have indicated that the affinity of 
A or other amyloid proteins for phospholipid membranes was altered by membrane 
components [178,179,180,181].  Once associated with membranes, cholesterol and

(monosialotetrahexosylganglioside: a member of the family of glycosphingolipids
which contain one sialic acid residue) tends to be highly concentrated in certain 
regions of neurons, especially in pre- and post-synaptic membranes [211].  In respect 
to the functionality, gangliosides have been associated with a number of important 
neurological events such as neuritogenesis, neurodifferentiation, synaptogenesis, and 
synaptic transmission.
It has been found that ganglioside or sphingolipid levels and composition are 
changed in AD brains, implying the importance of this lipid class in AD pathology
[212].  Working with isolated gangliosdie-bound A(1-42), studies showed that the 
brain tissue which contained increasing levels of diffuse plaques also included 
increased amounts of ganglioside-bound A(1-42).  Also, some of the A peptides in 
diffuse plaques were bound to GM1 or its related members [213,214].  Researchers
have proposed a possible mechanism whereby the membrane-bound A species might 
be shed into the extracellular space and served as a “seed” for fibril formation [215].
Additionally, a large body of data suggested that gangliosides might play a role in A
fibrillogenesis after binding to membranes or in acceleration of A fibril formation in 
vitro [179,216,217,218,219].
Cholesterol and/or gangliosides have been linked to certain biological activities of
A other amyloid-forming peptides [43,76].  Investigations demonstrated that 
cholesterol reduction and depletion of membrane associated sialic acid residue both 
not only significantly reduced the A-induced GTPase activity but also protected cells 
from A-induced toxicity, indicating the importance of A-membrane interactions in 
the mechanism of A toxicity.
Current and Future Therapeutic Strategies
In combating AD, considerable efforts have been directed toward seeking or 
developing a variety of therapeutic strategies, for example, improvement of
cholinergic neurotranmission, blockage of glutamate-mediated cytotoxicity, decrease
in APP expression, modulation of APP processing, elevation in the clearance rate of 
aggregated A, prevention of tangle formation, suppression of inflammation, and 
minimization of oxidative stress [46,220,221,222].
The discovery that acetylcholine played an important role in the development of 
AD prompted the search for medications that inhibit the breakdown of available 
acetylcholine in the brain.  One such group of drugs is the cholinesterase inhibitor
[46,59,60]. Until now, there are a couple of medications that have been approved by 
FDA for treating AD such as acetylcholine esterase (AChE) inhibitors and 
N-methyl-D-asparate (NMDA) antagonists [220,221,223]. Several AChE 
inhibitors/drugs, such as Donepezil, Galantamine, and Rivastigamine, are designed to

directly to A fibrils [225,226,227]. A semisynthetic bacteriocidal antibiotic drug,
rifampicin, used for leprosy and tuberculosis, along with its derivatives, were found to 
exhibit anti-aggregating and toxicity-reducing potency [228,229]. In addition, a few 
studies have been focused on the interaction(s) between A species and surfactant 
molecules. Two amphiphilic surfactants, di-C6-PC and di-C7-PC, were shown to 
possess anti-aggregating and anti-amyloidogenic activities [230].  Upon the addition 
of another surfactant n-dodecylhexaoxyethylene glycol monoether in a 
concentration-dependent fashion, a decrease in the rate of aggregation was also 
observed [118].  Hexadecyl-N-methylpiperidinium bromide, a cationic surfactant, 
has been reported to exhibit anti-amyloidogenic actions on both toxic oligomeric and 
fibrillar A species [231].  Other non-peptidic molecules, including aspirin, nicotine, 
melatonin, trehalose, fructose, were found to delay or prevent A fibrillogenesis 
and/or  associated cytotoxicity [81,232,233,234,235,236].
Peptidic Inhibitors: Methods using shorter peptide fragments, for example, KLVFF, 
GVVIN, RVVIA, as the self-recognition sequence have been employed for the 
prevention of A fibrillogenesis/aggregation [103,237,238].  Due to their marked 
affinity for A or critical involvement in A aggregation, these shorter peptide 
fragments are able to interact with A molecule, change the structure that A adopts, 
and thus prevent the process of A assembly.  Studies showed that numerous 
compounds that are composed of a recognition domain, consisting of all or part of the 
sequence KLVFF, and a disrupting domain have been found to hamper A fibril 
formation [239,240]. Apart from KLVFF, IIGL, the 31-34 residue fragment of A, 
with arginine attached to the N-terminus, was also demonstrated to inhibit A
fibrillogenesis and decrease A-induced toxicity [241].  Another group of peptidic 
inhibitors are the compounds containing so called -sheet breaker peptides.  These
-sheet breaker peptides, associated wth the incorporation of proline, were shown to 
prevent A aggregation and in vitro cytotoxicity owing to the -sheet breaking nature 
of proline.  Examples of these -sheet breaker inhibitors include LPFFD and LPYFD
[237,242].  Other small peptidic molecules that have been revealed to exert 
inhibitory action against A aggregation or cytotoxicity fall into a category of small
heat shock proteins with molecular chaperones-like activity [243,244].
It should be noted that, while these small non-peptidic molecules taken orally can
readily reach the brain in significant quantities due to their small size and ability to 
pass through the blood-brain-barrier, the value of these molecules as amyloid 
inhibitors has been thwarted by a number of properties including possible toxic effects 
on other tissues and their lack of specificity.  As for the peptidic inhibitors, high 
potency and specificity are two advantages over the non-peptidic molecules; however, 
their peptide nature is also the cause for their rapid degradation and short

targeting different levels of the metabolic pathways may be required to combat the 
devastating illness such as the Alzheimer’s disease.
Example 2: Cataract
Epidemiology of Cataract
Cataract, the light scattering opacification of crystalline lens in the eye, is one of 
the most common eye diseases that affect populations globally.  A recent estimate by 
the World Health Organization shows that, of the 37 million cases of blindness 
worldwide, about 50% of these are due to cataract and that although the disease is 
treatable, it is the leading cause of blindness from 1990 ~ 2002 [250].  Demographic 
studies have found that the prevalence of this disease increases two-folds every ten 
years after the age of fourty in developed countries [251,252] and much higher in 
developing countries [253].  The strong association with age and the general trend of 
increased life-expectancy across the globe exemplify the widespread nature of this 
disease.  
Currently, the only recognized treatment is surgical removal of the opacified lens 
and despite efforts to develop blindness prevention programs that make cataract 
surgery more readily accessible to those who need it, the number of blindness and 
severe visual impairment caused by the disease is expected to rise due to unsuccessful 
attempts to curb it in low and middle-income countries [254].  In these parts of the 
world, the accessibility of healthcare is complicated by the fact that majority of the 
poor and undeserved live in rural, remote areas and have difficulties in reaching the 
very few qualified providers who are usually drawn to areas of better living standards.  
Another barrier to healthcare is the fact that these populations are oftentimes ignorant 
of the merit of medical intervention.  The affordability of medical services in some 
of these countries is also an issue with the poor, as demonstrated by China’s increased 
cost in cataract surgery over the last two decades [255] .
In addition to the ongoing global efforts to counter the aforementioned difficulties, 
efforts to find more cost-effective and accessible alternatives to treating this disease 
are also in progress.  In order to explore these alternatives, a thorough understanding 
of the disease process involved in the development of cataract on a cellular and 
molecular basis is imperative, and great strides have been made toward this area of 
research in recent years.  In the following sections, we will discuss research updates 
on the mechanisms of cataractogenesis with reference to the unique structure and 
function of the normal lens.  Current and potential therapeutic options will also be 
explored.

Molecular Biology of the Lens
Since all lens fibers are retained throughout the lifetime of the host, it is 
imperative that the lens maintains its stability on both cellular and molecular level in 
order to serve its refractive function.  In addition to the orderly arrangement of the 
densely compacted lens fibers, structure regularity also permeates to the molecular 
level.  About 90% of the lens is composed of proteins that are divided into two 
groups: water-insoluble and soluble proteins.  The insoluble proteins are of the 
membrane and cytoskeletal types while the soluble proteins consist mainly of 
crystallins, which are largely responsible for the unique property of the lens at the 
molecular level.  
The crystallins, one of the oldest proteins in the body, are highly stable and consist 
of the majority of proteins in the lens.  It is thought that these structural proteins 
originally evolved from stress proteins and enzymes.  The crystallin proteins are 
divided into two super families:  and -crystallins.  The -crystallin is found to be 
a member of the heat shock proteins while -crystallins are considered relatives of 
microbial stress proteins.  Studies have shown that evolutionary divergence early on 
may have split the -crystallins into two distinct families: - and -crystallins [260]. 
The crystallin families are further divided into different subunits: A and B of the -
family, A1 ~ A4 and B1 ~ B3 of the -family, and A ~ F and S of the -family 
[261]. 
The uniform short-range order arrangement of these proteins in the cytoplasm of 
the lens cells is largely responsible for minimizing light scatter that contributes to the 
structural transparency of the lens [262].  Its role in structural transparency has made
the crystallins the center of attention in the study of cataractogenesis.  A number of 
researches have been focused on the structures and functions of the crystallin proteins 
through mutagenesis studies both in vivo and in vitro.
Research Updates on Crystallin Proteins
About 50% of the human lens proteins are composed of -crystallins.  The 
abundance of this protein signifies its importance in the lens not only as a structural 
protein, but also a molecular chaperone for - and -crystallins.  -Crystallin has 
also been found to interact with other types of noncrystallin proteins and enzymes
such as insulin, -lactalbumin, alcohol dehydrogenase, and citrate synthase [263,264].  
Its dual function as both a structural protein and a chaperone to prevent aggregation of 
other protein species makes it a popular target for research.  Structural 
characterization of -crystallin has been difficult due to its dynamic nature of subunit

forming aggregates are also areas of focus that have shed some light on the roles of 
these proteins in maintaining lens transparency [298,299,300,301,302].
On further examination, the crystallins serve more functions in the lens than was 
previously recongnized.  Aside from being structural proteins in the lens fibers, -
and -crystallins are also expressed in lens epithelial cells, although their functions in 
these cells have yet to be indentified [303].  -Crystallin expression, on the other 
hand, is found to be associated with regulating lens epithelial cell proliferation and 
differentiation into lens fiber through maintaining genomic stability and organizing 
cytoskeletal components [303,304,305].  The differentiation of lens cells is akin to 
apoptosis and its regulation concerns -crystallins [306].  Another function of 
-crystallin in the lens involves its chaperone activity to assist in the recovery of 
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in the glycolytic pathway 
that exhibits decreased activity in cataractous lens [307].
Besides being present in the lens, the crystallins have been found in extralenticular 
tissues signifying that these proteins have other functions in the body as well.  
-Crystallin’s involvement in apoptosis has been shown in retinal pigment epithelium 
and tumor cells of different cell lines [308,309].  Upregulation of crystallin
expression is implicated in various types of retinal injuries [310,311].  Both - and 
-crystallins are involved in normal intraocular vascular development [312].  
Presence of the crystallin proteins and their multiple functions in extralenticular 
tissues indicates that altering their expressions may have impact on certain disease 
processes such as retinal pathologies [313,314,315,316], glaucomatous optic 
neuropathy [317], desmin-related cardiomyopathy [318,319], cancers [320], and 
various neurodegenerative diseases [321,322,323].
Cataract
Risk factors that can potentially cause damage to the lens on both a molecular and 
cellular level can contribute to the formation of cataract.  Some of these risk factors 
include UV exposure, trauma, surgical injury, radiation, systemic and ocular drugs, 
cigarette smoking, alcohol, malnutrition, and chronic diarrhea [253,324,325,326].  
The nature of assult to the lens dictates the types of cataract that can be formed [327].  
Clinically, cataract is classified based on the structural location where the 
opacification occurs.  The most common types of cataracts are ones that are related 
to age, including subcapsular, cortical, and nuclear cataracts [327].  Cortical cataract 
is the most prevalent up to age 65 while nuclear sclerosis, which usually occurs above 
65 years of age, is considered the second most common [328,329].  Posterior 
subcapsular cataract is rated the third in prevalence and is caused by the disruption in 
the epithelial layer of the lens [256].

[327,341,342].  One prevalent theory that involves the age-related changes is the 
formation of lens barrier between the nucleus and the cortex of the lens.  The barrier, 
partly accredited to the increased binding of -crystallin to lipid membrane [334],
alters the lens morphology and physiology resulting in an obstruction of cell-to-cell 
transport of nutrients, antioxidants, ions, and small molecules between the two regions 
of the lens [333,343].  As the flow of molecules between the nucleus and the cortex 
decreases, oxidation within the quiescent nucleus becomes a problem as antioxidants 
are kept out while reactive species that can cause damage are retained within, 
ultimately resulting in the formation of nuclear cataract [331].
Current and Future Therapeutic Strategies
The surgical removal of opacified lens has long been the standard procedure in the 
treatment of cataract and is still, currently, the only treatment accepted worldwide.  
However, substantial barriers to cataract surgery have sparked an ongoing search for 
cheaper and more accessible alternatives to solving the cataract problem.  In this 
respect, the study of potential pharmacological and nutraceutical agents in preventing 
or even reversing cataract has been an area of interest.  Therapeutic strategies have 
been targeted toward mechanisms such as preservation or replenishment of 
antioxidants, inhibition of sugar metabolism that leads to lens damage, inhibition of 
over-active proteolytic enzymes, and protection or possible upregulation of 
-crystallins in the lens[338,344,345].  
Of the potential agents examined, the most widely researched are the ones that 
counteract against oxidative stress in the lens.  Disulfiram, an antioxidant and a 
scavenger for reactive oxygen species (ROS), has been shown to prevent the 
development of selenite-induced cataracts in animal models [346].  Pyruvate, 
another antioxidant with ROS scavenging property, also delays cataract progression 
[347].  Tempol-H, the hydroxylamine of nitroxide Tempol, inhibits cataract 
formation in lens organ culture of rats and rhesus monkey by preventing glutathione 
loss [348].  Despite the promising results depicted in the antioxidant studies, these 
pharmacological agents have not yet been approved for human testing. 
It is interesting to note, however, that certain over-the-counter (OTC) ophthalmic 
solutions claiming to prevent cataract are already being sold in Europe and Asia.  
Although some scientific evidence has shown that they protect lens from opacification 
to some extent, these results are not deemed as sufficient grounds for recognition by 
governments worldwide as acceptable cataract treatments [349,350,351,352,353].  In 
regards to nutraceutical agents with antioxidant property, both animal tests and human 
clinical trials have been conducted.  Nutrients including beta-carotene, riboflavin, 
niacin, and vitamins C and E have yielded mixed results that one report suggested the

Interestingly, our preliminary data demonstrate that carnosine exhibits an 
anti-fibrillogenic potency (shown in Figure 2). Perhaps it is the dual role of this 
dipeptide as an antiglycation agent and antioxidant that boasts greater potential for 
protection against a multifactorial disease such as cataract.  However, whether it will 
be accepted worldwide as a recognized treatment, rest on further extensive clinical 
studies to provide a solid proof of its efficacy as an anti-cataract agent.  
It may take years before an alternative to cataract surgery will gain acceptance 
from the general public.  In the meantime, the best prevention against the disease is 
through public education on ways to minimize risk factors that can contribute to the 
development of cataract.  Such preventative measures include wearing protective sun 
gear to reduce UV exposure from sunlight and warnings against social habits, such as 
smoking and excessive alcohol consumption [253].  
Conclusion
Protein aggregation is, without a doubt, a wide-ranging phenomenon and is of 
paramount importance in biochemical research and human pathology.  In the current 
review, a general overview of protein aggregation and associated diseases is first 
presented.  Next, attention is focused on the properties, features, and causes of 
protein aggregates.  Finally, two important protein aggregation diseases, Alzheimer’s 
disease and cataract, are given as examples.  Along with epidemiology, research 
updates concerning the pathogenesis, existing mechanisms and relevant hypotheses, 
and current as well as promising therapeutic strategies for these two diseases are 
described.  Although various approaches and a diversity of compounds have been 
suggested, the ideal pharmacological agents for curing the diseases involving protein 
aggregation have yet to be identified.  It is our belief that the successful development 
of therapeutic agents for these diseases not only requires a full understanding of the 
mechanisms of protein aggregation process, but also an extensive investigation into 
the drug penetration, efficacy, and side-effects once it has been found.
