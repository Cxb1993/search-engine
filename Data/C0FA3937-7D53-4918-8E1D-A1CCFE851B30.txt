ABSTRACT
A novel constant force feedback mechanism based on fuzzy logic for a tapping mode
Atomic Force Microscope is proposed in this paper. A nonlinear dynamic model for
characterizing the cantilever-sample interaction which contains large uncertainty is first
developed. Then, a PID-like fuzzy controller is designed to overcome the shortcomings of a
traditional PID controller in a tapping mode Atomic Force Microscope. Fuzzy logic allows
inference and computations of the controller efforts based on partial membership. Using the
PID-like fuzzy controller allows the cantilever tip to track sample surface rapidly and accurately
even though the topography of the surface is arbitrary and not given in advanced. The rapid
tracking response facilitates us to observe high aspect ratio micro structure accurately and quickly.
The overshoot which will result in tip crash in commercial AFMs with a traditional PID
controller could be avoided. Additionally, continuous manual gain-tuning by trial and error such
as those in commercial AFMs to schedule the controller efforts is alleviated. In final, a computer
simulation is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and confirm validity of the proposed
controller.
Keywords: Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), piezoelectric tube scanner, tapping mode, PID-like
fuzzy controller.
signal is generated from the fuzzy rule base and is used adaptively to schedule the controler’s 
efforts to regulate the tip-surface force interaction according to a prescribed force set-point
property. In this way, this system achieves high-speed and accurate tracking of the sample
topography.
It should be noted that the rapid and accurate tracking response of the PID-like TSFLC
allows us to observe high aspect ratio micro structures. Furthermore, the continuous utilization of
excess on-line and manual gain-scheduling to improve the tracking response of the traditional
PID tuning method can thus be avoided through the use of the proposed fuzzy control method.
This is especially beneficial for AFM operators who are not experts in the field of control
engineering. They could pay more attention to sample observation without real-time tuning the
PID gains as needed in traditional AFMs.
II. MODELING OF A TAPPING MODE ATOMIC FORCE MICROSCOPE.
In tapping mode AFMs the microcantilever with a sharp tip, as seen in Fig. 4, is initially
driven into oscillation at a frequency df slightly off resonance using a piezoelectric crystal
element with excitation amplitude dA . Herein, the displacement of the free microcantilever
center with respect to the sample is
htztl  )(max)( , (1)
where z(t) denotes the dynamic amplitude equation of the oscillating tip and h is the minimum
tip-sample distance. Here, for ease of real-time observation and analysis, the continuous changes
in amplitude of the oscillating cantilever are detected and then converted into their related
root-mean-square (RMS) value utilizing a RMS-to-DC converter [21]. The definition of the RMS
value of a voltage signal )(tV is

A. Second-Order Model.
Generally, when the tip is far away from the sample, it is free and the interaction force is
minimal as seen in Phase-1 of Fig. 5. In others words, this implies 0,)(max)(  ttztl . In this
condition, according to Fig. 5, considering the vertical motion of the tip and the free cantilever,
the governed equation of the cantilever motion without tip-sample force interaction is

are the new steady-state amplitude and phase lag signals. According to Eqs. (21) and (22), since
dA , df , effm , and  are fixed, thus )(tA and )(t are time-varying functions of the resonant
frequency 'of which varies with respect to the effective spring constant )(' tkk as seen in Eq.
(19). Thus, one can easily observe that as long as the tip-sample force mechanism changes, the
force constant )(' tk and the eigenfrequency 'of in Eq. (19) vary correspondingly. These
changes also result in the variations of )(tA and )(t in Eqs. (21) and (22). As a consequence, a
change in tip-sample ))(( tzFts gives rise to a shift in the resonant frequency 'of and a
corresponding drop in the amplitude and phase lag signals of the oscillating cantilever.
While performing sample-scanning, the tip interacts with the sample periodically in the end
of the negative cycle of the oscillation. In this condition, variations in the tip-sample interaction
force change the effective spring coefficient )(' tkk and shift the resonant frequency 'of of the
oscillating cantilever. While it is initially driven at a fixed frequency df below its resonance
frequency without force interaction, this shift of the resonant frequency yields in the reduction of
the tip amplitude. In other words, )(tA and )(t vary with respect to the topography of the
sample when the probe is interacting with the sample.
C. Feedback control.
In general, when the sample translates horizontally relative to the tip, any change in the
height of the surface causes the tip-sample force to change simultaneously. In the mean time,
when the driving frequency of the cantilever is near its mechanical resonance frequency 'of
shown in Eq. (19), the local force gradient shifts the resonance frequency. This shift in the
resonance frequency causes the amplitude variation of the oscillating cantilever. The cantilever
deflection is sensed by a four-quadrant PSPD using the optical lever method. In this arrangement
a small deflection of the cantilever tilts the reflected beam and changes the position of the beam
on the PSPD.
The cantilever deflection, which corresponds to a relative tip-sample force, is held constant
as pointsetRMS Atz )( while sample-scanning is being performed as seen in T1 of Fig. 6. In
other words, this deflection signal, pointset)( Atz RMS , is taken as a reference operation signal.
Typically, if the cantilever amplitude signal increases to pointset)( Atz RMS as seen in T3 of Fig. 6,
this implies the tip is farther from the sample than the previous point was. Conversely, since the
cantilever amplitude signal decreases to pointset)( Atz RMS in T2 of Fig. 6, this represents that the
point of the tip is closer to the sample than the previous point. Hence, a feedback control system
is necessarily to adjust the input voltage of the Z-axis of the piezoelectric tube scanner to
where 251 i represents the i-th rule and A, B, and f are the linguistic values of e(t), de(t), and
U(t), respectively, in the i-th rule. Ueq is the fuzzy set of control input. Accordingly, the rules of
the PID-like fuzzy logic controller are shown in Table 1. Herein, a total of 25 fuzzy rules are used
in this case and the control input U(t) is inferred based on this table. Practically, the intersection
cell of the row and the column contains the linguistic value for the output of the fuzzy rule. The
output of the fuzzy controller is a fuzzy subset. Generally, before exploiting the fuzzy controller
to control the considered object, it is necessarily for the object to be defuzzificated and then
converted into an accurate quantity. Figure 12 shows the surface viewer of the fuzzy controller
that results from the rules shown in Table 1. Actually, the surface in this figure is equivalent to a
superposition of the two fuzzy input variables. Using the PID-like fuzzy controller, as shown in
Fig. 8, accompanied by Figs. 9-12, the output of the PID-like fuzzy controller is

controllers. The PID type fuzzy controller [20] mentioned above retains characteristics similar to
conventional PID controllers. This type of fuzzy controller is exploited here to improve the
performance of the control systems under consideration.
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, a simulation and experimental study is given to show the effectiveness of
the proposed method. To derive a model of the tip-deflection subsystem, a homemade dynamic
frequency analyzer software is developed using a Borland C++ Builder V6.0 and a DT322
multifunction data acquisition board [22]. Figure 13 demonstrates the frequency response of the
tip without tip-sample force interaction, where the input is )(tR and the output is RMStz )( .
Figure 14 shows the simulation results of the output response with respect to a unit step
input which is used to simulate a height change in topography of the sample. It is observed that
the settling times for the system considered, subject to a step input, are approximately 0.2ms and
3ms for the system with a PID-like fuzzy controller and with a traditional PID controller,
respectively. Hence, the time for the tip to return to a prescribed oscillating amplitude set-point
for an AFM with a PID-like fuzzy feedback is faster than that of an AFM with a PID controller.
Besides, in Fig. 14 we can also observe that the overshoot for system with a PID-like fuzzy
controller is smaller than that of system with a conventional PID controller. The reduction in
overshoot significantly reduces the possibility for the tip to penetrate from the attractive force
region to the repulsive force region and prevents the tip from being damaged. In other words, this
also implies that the piezoelectric tube can be rapidly moved up and down to return to the desired
vertical position which is related to the height of the sample at each point.
In addition, Fig. 15 shows the normalized controller output U(t) of the AFM system with a
periodic square wave input at a frequency of 250Hz. Since the control effort is applied to
schedule the input voltage of the Z-axis of the piezoelectric tube scanner, thus, it usually is
considered as a good measure of the sample surface profile. In accordance with this, the large
overshoot of the traditional PID control system induces a counterfeit image of the sample. On the
contrary, because the overshoot of the PID-like fuzzy control system is smaller, the image quality
and accuracy of the sample can be improved by exploiting the proposed PID-like fuzzy control
scheme. Further, Fig. 16 shows the actual and reference displacement tip trajectory of the AFM
system with a reference square wave input at a frequency of 250Hz. Here, the reference square
wave input is used to simulate a periodic up-and-down structure in the surface profile of the
sample. Clearly, we can observe that the movement of the Z-axis of the piezoelectric tube forces
the tip to track the sample profile rapidly and with high accuracy. In other words, even though the
topology of the surface is arbitrary and is not known in advanced, the cantilever tip can rapidly
succeed in tracking task subjects with only very little error.
By exploiting the proposed PID-like fuzzy control technique, rapid transient response
improvement in both the rise and settling times can be achieved. Shorter settling time enables the
AFM system to scan samples at a higher scanning rate and allows us to observe high aspect ratio
micro structures. Moreover, a small percent of overshoot allows the cantilever tip to return to the
