Abstract 
The impact of aerosols on human and environmental health is closely related to the aerosol size and shape, 
in addition to its concentration and chemical composition. Unless the particles are spherical, the “diameter” 
thus has a precise meaning. The objectives of the present study are to build a system for the measurement of 
aerosol morphological characteristics, and to apply the system to the aerosols from metal buffing process and 
diesel engine exhaust. A SMPS/CPC and a NanoMOUDI were used to simultaneously measure the 
mobility-diameter/number and aerodynamic-diameter/mass of the aerosols, respectively. Additionally, field 
emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) observations were used to supplement the above 
measurements. The results show that, with the present mobility-mass methodology, the estimated to the 
measured particle number concentration ratios decrease with increasing particles sizes up to 100 nm. Similar 
and consistent results were obtained for the particle mass. The estimated effective densities for the particles 
under study decrease and approach the assumed densities with increasing particle size. This indicates that the 
spherical particle assumption is likely valid for larger nanoparticles. The overestimated particle number or 
underestimated particle mass from the smaller nanoparticles also suggests that there are positive sampling 
artifacts with the impactor sampling. The SEM observations show the buffing process produced two distinct 
types of particles: irregular flake-like particles and spherical particles. The flake-like particles are in the 
micrometer size range, likely produced as a result of mechanical removal from the metal products. The 
spherical particles are in the nanometer to micrometer size ranges, likely originate from molten metal debris 
which then solidified after cooling. The DEPs are predominantly compact-aggregates composed of primary 
particles in the size range of ~30 nm. Overall, the results indicate that the morphology of particles from metal 
buffing process and diesel engine could largely deviate from spherical shape and unit density. The present 
study provides a solid foundation for sequent in-depth study of particle morphology crucial for a more refined 
impact and exposure assessment of aerosols.

particles into fractal-like aggregates or agglomerates [Park et al., 2004; Burtscher, 2005]. In such case, the 
assumption of spherical particles can in fact lead to erroneous estimation as well as conclusion. This 
highlights the importance of morphological parameters, such as size, shape, and density in characterizing 
aerosols and their effects on human and environmental health. 
The density (ρ) of particles is also an important property of aerosols, because density is required to 
determine the relationship between Stokes diameter and aerodynamic diameter (dae) and for the conversion of 
measured number distribution to mass distribution [McMurry et al., 2002]. It is also relevant to the transport 
and depositional properties of aerosols in human respiratory system. Particles that deviate from the ideal 
characteristics of standard density (ρ = 1000 mg cm-3) and spherical shape have pronounced effects on the 
sizing method [DeCarlo et al., 2004]. For example, electrical mobility equivalent diameters (dme) increase 
with increasing deviation from sphere. Figure 2 illustrates the trajectories of spherical particles with different 
sizes in an electric field. Noted the irregular-shaped particle which has identical volume of the small particles 
is following the same trajectory of the large spherical particle. One of the many ways for determining aerosol 
density is to measure the aerodynamic or electrical mobility equivalent diameter and particle mass (mp) 
simultaneously, such that the density can be indirectly derived by the dividing the mass with the equivalent 
particle volume (Ve).  
2. Experimental Methods 
2.1 Instrumentation 
The number size distributions of aerosols were measured by a scanning mobility particle sizer and a 
condensation particle counter (SMPS/CPC; Model 5.500, GRIMM Aerosol Technik, Gmbh, Germany). The 
SMPS consists of a long Vienna-type differential mobility analyzer (L-DMA; Model 55-900) and a 
butanol-based CPC (Model 5.403). The inlet of the L-DMA consists of an impactor with a 50% collection 
efficiency of 1082 nm, followed by an Am-241 neutralizer (Model 5.522). With its default set up, the inner 
electrode of the L-DMA is positively charged. The detectable aerosol mobility diameters range from 11.1 to 
1083.3 nm (44 size bins) with a sheath and sample flow of 3 lpm and 0.3 lpm, respectively. The saturator and 
condensor temperature of the CPC was set at 40 °C and 15 °C, respectively. It has a 50% counting efficiency 
at 4.5 nm and measures number concentration up to 2×104 cm-3 with single particle counting and coincidence 
correction, and up to 107 cm-3 with the photometric mode. The SMPS was set to produce one average particle 
number size distribution every 4 min. The SMPS has been routinely sent back to the manufacturer for 
calibration each year. In addition, prior to the study the sizing accuracy was determined by sampling NaCl of 
known mobility sizes (50, 76, 113, 168, and 241 nm) from a monodisperse aerosol generator (TSI; Model 
3475), simultaneously with another SMPS (TSI; Model 3936). The differences between the expected sizes and 
the measured mode sizes were less than 3 nm.  
The mass-size distributions of aerosols were measured by a nano micro-orifice uniform deposit impactor

CPC measures db/N, all of which will be used as input parameters to estimate the particle effective density 
(ρeff). The experimental setup can be adjusted for SMPS-MOUDI in-series or in-parallel setup. 
2.3 Data Analysis 
Effective or apparent density (ρeff) is an operational definition of a specific type of particle density; in 
other words, there are various ways of obtaining ρeff, leading to different density values for a given particle. 
Nevertheless, ρeff is a parameter determined by a combination of two aerosol measurement techniques. 
Amongst, mobility-mass measurements and mobility-aerodynamic measurements are the two most common 
techniques for deriving ρeff. In the mobility-mass technique, the ρeff is the ratio of measured particle mass (mp) 
to the particle volume calculated assuming a spherical particle with a diameter of dme as below:

3.2 Mobility-Mass Measurements of Diesel Engine Nanoparticles 
 With the diesel engine particles, we investigated the relationships between particle number and mass 
and average effective densities for particles emitted at engine idle, low, medium and high load. Figures 3 to 6 
show the Mest./Mmea. ratios, Nest./Nmea. ratios, and the ρeff. As shown, the trends of the ratios and the effective 
densities are similar to that observed for the metal buffing nanoparticles. The estimated effective density for 
the larger nano-sized diesel engine particles is close to that of soot particles (1800 mg cm-3).

3.4 SEM Observations of Diesel Engine Particles 
 With the diesel engine particles, we collected whole aerosol samples for SEM observations. Figure 12 
shows a 22K-X SEM photograph of the diesel engine particles. As shown, the diesel engine particles are 
predominantly shown as nano-sized compact aggregates, as opposed to the common perception of chain-like 
aggregates. A closer examination shows that the aggregates are composed of primary soot particles of sizes 
between 10-40 nm (Figure 13). An EDS scan shows that the diesel engine particles are composed primarily of 
carbon (Figure 14).

4. Conclusion 
 In the present study, a SMPS/CPC and a NanoMOUDI were used to simultaneously measure the 
mobility-diameter/number and aerodynamic-diameter/mass of the aerosols, respectively. In addition, field 
emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) observations were used to supplement the above 
measurements. The results show that, with the present mobility-mass methodology, the estimated to the 
measured particle number concentration ratios decrease with increasing particles sizes up to 100 nm. Similar 
and consistent results were obtained for the estimated to the measured particle mass concentration ratios. The 
estimated effective densities for the particles under study decrease and approach the assumed densities with 
increasing particle size. This indicates that the spherical particle assumption is likely valid for larger 
nanoparticles. The overestimated particle number or underestimated particle mass from the smaller 
nanoparticles also suggests that there are positive sampling artifacts with the impactor sampling. The SEM 
observations show the buffing process produced two distinct types of particles: irregular flake-like particles 
and spherical particles. The flake-like particles are in the micrometer size range, likely produced as a result of 
mechanical removal from the metal products. The spherical particles are in the nanometer to micrometer size 
ranges, likely originate from molten metal debris which then solidified after cooling in the ambient air. The 
DEPs are predominantly compact-aggregates composed of primary particles in the size range of ~30 nm. 
Overall, the results indicate that the morphology of particles emitted from metal buffing process and diesel 
engine could largely deviate from spherical shape and unit density. The present study provides a solid 
foundation for sequent in-depth study of particle morphology crucial for a more refined impact and exposure 
assessment of aerosols.
