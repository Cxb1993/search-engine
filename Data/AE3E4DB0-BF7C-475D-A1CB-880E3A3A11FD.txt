(about 10 minutes) and the use of poisonous 
substances, such as mercury. However, the 
LED is gradually beginning to replace 
traditional CCFL as light source for LCD 
BLU due to their desirable characteristics, 
such as a large color gamut, color 
temperature adjustability, long durability, 
and environmental safety (i.e. mercury free). 
The LED BLU has been applied in not only 
large size display (such as NB) but also small 
size display (cellular phone). Since the 
second half of 2007, NB panels with white 
LED backlight has been increasingly popular 
because it’s thinner, lighter and more 
energy-saving and more portable, as shown 
in Fig. 1 [1]. The heat and the cost are 
considerations caused by using more LED 
numbers for the large display panel. With the 
improvement of brightness and technology, 
however, it would be helpful in cost 
reduction. The required LED numbers may 
be decreased in the future. In recent years, in 
order to satisfy the strict market requirements 
for mobile phones and displays panels, the 
light source is desirable to have a slim size, 
lighter weight, longer battery life, low energy 
consumption and high luminance. Many 
researchers have devoted a tremendous 
amount of effort to improving the qualities of 
CCFL-BLU [2, 3, 4]. Furthermore, many 
studies have been performed in efforts to 
increase the luminance and uniformity of 
LED BLU by optimizing the location, size 
and patterns of micro-structures or diffusive 
dots on the light guide plate [5, 6, 7, 8]. For 
realizing the efficient and the uniform 
luminance of the BLU, design of such an 
output lightguide is very important.  Kohrou 
et al [9] recommended the LED reflector on 
anisotropic silicon-based to enhance the 
output efficiency, as shown in Fig. 2. Yourii 
et al [10] reported an optical system for an 
edge-lit backlight using RGB high-power 
LEDs as a light source, as shown in Fig. 3. 
Xing et al [11] proposed a novel compound 
hyperbolic concentrator-type reflector for use 
in liquid crystal display backlight systems. 
Sung et al [12] reported the microlens array 
(MLA) diffusers by using 3D diffuser 
lithography and UV-curable polymer 
technologies for RGB LED backlight 
systems. Paul et al [13] reported a novel 
cone-shaped lens cap for improving 
brightness and high uniformity of the direct 
LED Backlight Units (BLUs) on large area 
LCD-TVs. A LED light coupler is presented 
for coupling light from a mini sideview LED 
of 0.4 mm height to a very thin (0.3 mm) 
light guide [14]. Chien et al [15, 16] 
recommended a LED light-linear device with 
microprsims not only can decrease the 
number of LED to save the space, but also 
enhance the optical efficiency.

In comparison to previous researches, in 
order to overcome the heat, the shadow and 
illuminative uniformity problems,we propose 
a LED uniform lightguide, which enable the 
incident light to distribute uniformly to the 
BLU. The LED lightguide enable the 
4 
concave mirror 
 
Three cases are used to explain the LED 
location and its light guided situation. In the 
first case, the LED is located above the 
principal axis at a position beyond the center 
of curvature (C). The ray diagram shows that 
the image of the LED is located at between 
the center of curvature (C) and the focal 
point (F), as shown in Fig. 8(a). In the second 
case, the LED is located above the principal 
axis between the center of curvature (C) and 
the focal point (F). The ray diagram shows 
that the image of the LED is located beyond 
the center of curvature (C), as shown in Fig. 
8(b). In the third case, the LED is located 
above the principal axis between the focal 
point (F) and the mirror. The ray diagram 
shows that the image of the LED is located 
behind the mirror, as shown in Fig. 8(c).

the concave mirror, (a) first case, (b) second case, (c) third 
case 
 
The ray diagram may be utilized to 
determine the approximate location and size 
of the image, but it will not provide 
numerical information about image distance 
and the LED size. To obtain the numerical 
information, it is necessary to use the mirror 
equation to express the quantitative 
relationship between the LED distance (do), 
the image distance (di), and the focal length 
(f). The equation is represented as:

Our designed LED uniform lightguide is 
made of PMMA with a refractive index of n 
=1.49. The concave cylinder is constructed in 
the lightguide such as a mirror. To guide the 
reflected light into the thickness of 0.8mm 
for the LGP, a ladder cylinder is considered 
in the lightguide device, as shown in Fig. 9. 
The radius of curvature is designed to be 
3mm and its output length is 33mm for the 
concave uniform lightguide.

APILUX optical modeling software is 
applied to simulated and analyzed the optical 
properties for the LED uniform lightguide. A 
typical process of an APILUX simulation, 
which is comprised three phases, i.e. 
pre-procedure, procedure, and 
post-procedure. The pre-procedure phase 
involves creating models of the light coupler 
and light sources. The ray tracing program is 
the core solver in the procedure phase. In the 
post-procedure phase, various analyses can 
be performed. The first, three-dimension of 
the lightguide is built by using the 
SOLIDWORKS software. The uniform 
lightguide is formed a powerful built-in 
International Graphics Exchange 
Specification (IGES) translator and is 
imported into the APILUX. In APILUX, the 
components such as the light source, the 
optical component and the detector are 
inserted in the system. Each component 
should be defined the optical property. To 
define the light source, which is based on the 
LED specification, the present simulations 
assume that the luminous flux of a single 
LED is 1 lm and that the angle of half 
intensity is 55 degree (side view LED). To 
define the optical component, the interfaces 
are utilized to import from SOLIDWORKS 
through IGES file. The material is used as 
the PMMA with a refractive index of n =1.49. 
The concave and the ladder interfaces are 
coated high reflection thin film for the 
uniform lightguide. To define the detector, 
6 
output area of the uniform lightguide is 
33mm x 0.8 mm with decreasing number of 
the LEDs and the illuminative uniformity of 
the LED uniform lightguide has achieved 
more than 85%. A new light-uniform 
lightguide not only uses only one LED to 
solve the heat and the cost problems, but also 
enhances the illuminative uniformity to guide 
light uniformly into the backlight plate. In 
the future, the integrated LED uniform 
lightguide is applied in backlight system to 
make display lighter, thinner and brighter.
