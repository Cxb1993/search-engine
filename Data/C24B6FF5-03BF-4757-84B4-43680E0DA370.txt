II. Circuit Description 
Fig. 2 shows the proposed DLL. This DLL is composed of a PD, a digitally controlled CP and a 
voltage-controlled delay line (VCDL), a start-controlled circuit and a statistical background 
calibration circuit (SBCC). The start-controlled circuit allows this DLL to avoid the harmonic 
locking issue [9]. When the DLL is locked, the SBCC is enabled. This SBCC is used to 
statistically detect the static phase error of the DLL and then adjusts the digitally controlled CP to 
minimize the static phase error. The detail circuits are discussed as follows.

III. Simulation and Experimental results 
 To verify the proposed DLL and the SBCC, the simulation results are performed with the 
following conditions. The static phase error of the proposed DLL without the SBCC is simulated 
firstly. The simulated static phase error is 4.7 degrees (14.6ps), 4.1 degrees (11.3ps), 3.1 degrees 
(7.8ps), and 2.8 degrees (6.5ps) for input clock of 0.9GHz, 1GHz, 1.1GHz and 1.2GHz, 
respectively.  
Assume that 5% mismatch between M1 and M2 in the first latch in Fig. 3(b) has a normal 
distribution. Then, the SBCC is turned on. The 1000 simulation results are generated for every 
input frequency from 0.9GHz to 1.2GH in a step of 0.1GHz. The Monte Carlo simulation results 
for the DLL with the SBCC are shown in Fig. 8. After the SBCC is turned on, the mean phase 
error is 1.6 degrees (5ps), 1.1 degrees (3ps), 1.1 degrees (2.75ps), and 0.64 degrees (1.5ps) for 
input clock of 0.9GHz, 1GHz, 1.1GHz and 1.2GHz, respectively. It demonstrates that the 
proposed calibration can reduce the static phase error caused by the current mismatch in a CP.

performances of this proposed DLL. Based on the simulation results, the power consumption of 
the DLL is 35mW with the SBCC consuming 12 mW.

IV. Conclusion 
The proposed DLL using the SBCC has been fabricated in CMOS 0.18um process. The 
proposed DLL operates within 0.9Hz~1.2GHz. The static phase error due to the current mismatch 
in a CP is calibrated by a statistical background method. The experimental results have 
demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed circuits.  
Supposed the transistor mismatch is small, it is useful to increase the number of the arbiters in the 
SBCC. Once the number of arbiters in the SBCC is increased, the phase error will be improved. 
However, transistor mismatch, noise, and the parasitic input capacitance of the arbiters, and the 
rising time of the clocks can limit the SBCC’s performance. The input capacitance of the arbiters 
increases the offset voltage of input signal. The will result in exactly the same output produced by 
all the arbiters.
