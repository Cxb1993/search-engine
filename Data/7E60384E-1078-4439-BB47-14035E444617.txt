robust-stable and optimal PDC control design 
problem. The computational complexity for 
both differential and integral in the 
robust-stable and optimal PDC control design 
of the original dynamic systems may therefore 
be reduced considerably. Then, for the static

is employed to find the robust-stable and 
quadratic-optimal PDC controllers of the

systems with elemental parametric

前言與研究目的 
在實際工程控制系統中，受控體(plants)
通常是非線性的，而要使非線性動態控制系
統達到所要求的控制目標，其控制器的設計
是一個相當不容易的過程。因此，有許多非
線性動態控制系統的控制器設計方法已被
發展出來克服這個難題(Slotine and Li, 1991; 
Marino and Tomei, 1995; Chen et al., 1999; 
Tsao et al., 2002)。近年來，由 Takagi 和
Sugeno(1985)所提出的 TS 模糊模型方法
(TS-fuzzy-model-based approach)是個非常
有效地來處理非線性控制系統的方法，此方
法在非線性動態控制系統的應用方面也已
經有許多成功的應用實例(Babuska, 1998; 
Farinwata et al., 2000; Tanaka and Wang, 
2001; Tong et al., 2004)。傳統上對於非線性
動態控制系統建模方法是以一個單一動態
模型來描述非線性動態控制系統的整體行
為模式，而 TS模糊模型方法則是結合多個
動態模型(特別是線性動態模型)，來描述非
線性動態控制系統的整體行為模式。因此，
當以 TS模糊模型方法來建構非線性動態控
制系統時，其最大優點是可以應用線性系統
的控制理論方法來設計控制器(Tanaka and 
Wang, 2001)。基於扇形非線性模糊模型建構
方法所建構出的 TS模糊模型動態控制系統
，其各模糊規則的線性動態模型中之前件項
(antecedent part) 模 糊 集 合 和 後 件 項
(consequent part)的線性動態方程式可以很
容易地由已知的非線性動態控制系統的物
理模式推導出來，而且保證非線性動態控制
系統可以精確地轉換成 TS模糊模型動態控
制系統(Tanaka and Wang, 2001)。也就是說
，使用扇形非線性模糊模型建構方法可以確
保原始的非線性動態控制系統與精確(exact) 
TS 模糊模型動態控制系統之間沒有近似誤
差(approximation error)。在精確 TS 模糊模
型動態控制系統的每一模糊規則有一線性
動態方程式作為後件項，此表示每一模糊規
則有其各別的動態行為，而整體的動態模型
則由這些模糊規則所共同合成而完成建模
。另外，在許多控制系統的工程實例中，由
於不準確的量測、參數不易獲得或是參數的
變異等原因，想獲得或保有參數的精確值是
非常困難的。因此在控制設計與分析的研究
課題方面，通常含有參數不確定量
(parametric uncertainties)，其描述可用不同
型式來表示，如參數矩陣中各別元素
(elemental)不確定量和參數不確定矩陣整體
視為有界範數(norm-bounded)等型式。參數
矩陣中各別元素不確定量是指考量的參數

2006)也針對 TS 模糊模型動態時延控制系
統的有限時間最佳控制問題，提出一結合柴

parallel distributed compensation (PDC) controllers for the
infinite-horizon optimal control problems of the TS fuzzy-
model-based control systems without time delays. For some
practical problems, we need to deal with the finite-horizon
(i.e., finite-time) optimal control problems [15]. However, it
is difficult to apply the LMI-based approaches proposed by
Tanaka and Wang [4], Tong et al. [5], Zheng et al. [13], and
Li [14] to solve the quadratic finite-horizon optimal PDC
control problem of the TS fuzzy-model-based control systems
with or without time delays. Moreover, for solving the optimal
PDC control problems of the TS fuzzy-model-based control
systems with or without time delays, there are some issues,
such as how to simplify the computation for the quadratic finite-
horizon optimal PDC control problem of the TS fuzzy-model-
based control systems with or without time delays and to ensure
some characteristics of the closed-loop systems, that need to be
resolved [16]. Thus, one of the most important issues for the
TS fuzzy-model-based control systems with or without time de-
lays is to develop the computational methods for designing the
quadratic finite-horizon optimal PDC controllers. Very recently,
Ho and Chou [17] have proposed a computational optimiza-
tion method, which integrates the shifted-Chebyshev-series
approach (SCSA) and the genetic algorithm (GA), to design
the quadratic optimal PDC controllers for the finite-horizon
optimal control problem of the TS fuzzy-model-based control
systems without time delays. Because the method proposed by
Ho and Chou [17] only involves the algebraic computation and
is straightforward and well adapted to computer implementa-
tion, the design procedures of the closed-loop quadratic finite-
horizon optimal PDC controllers for the TS fuzzy-model-based
control systems having no time delays may be either greatly
reduced or much simplified accordingly. Ho and Chou [17]
have also shown that the computational optimization method
integrating the SCSA and GA may obtain the better results
than the LMI-based approach [4], [5], [13], [14] for finding
the quadratic optimal PDC controllers of the TS fuzzy-model-
based control systems without time delays. In addition, Ho and
Chou [18], [19] have also shown that the SCSA may obtain the
better and more satisfactory results than the numerical method
given in the software of MATLAB Toolbox for solving the TS
fuzzy-model-based dynamic equations. That is, the SCSA is
a numerically efficient and computationally attractive method
for solving the TS fuzzy-model-based dynamic equations. On
the other hand, to the authors’ best knowledge, there are no
literature works to study the issue of designing the quadratic
finite-horizon optimal PDC controllers for the TS fuzzy-model-
based time-delay control systems. Therefore, from the earlier
statements and reasons, we can see that it is worthwhile to
present an efficiently numerical optimization approach accom-
panied with stabilizability condition to design the stable and
quadratic finite-horizon optimal PDC controllers for the TS
fuzzy-model-based time-delay control systems.
The purpose of this paper is to propose a numerical op-
timization method accompanied with stabilizability condition
to design the stable and quadratic optimal PDC controllers
for the finite-horizon optimal control problem of the exact TS
fuzzy-model-based time-delay control systems by integrating
the SCSA, the hybrid Taguchi–genetic algorithm (HTGA),
and the LMI technique, where the LMI technique is used to de-
rive the delay-dependent stabilizability condition for ensuring
that the closed-loop TS fuzzy-model-based time-delay control
systems can be stabilized. In this paper, by using the SCSA, the
stable and quadratic finite-horizon optimal PDC control prob-
lem for the TS fuzzy-model-based time-delay control systems
is replaced by a static parameter optimization problem repre-
sented by algebraic equations with constraint of the LMI-based
stabilizability condition, thus greatly simplifying the stable
and optimal PDC control design problem. The computational
complexity for both differential and integral in the stable and
optimal PDC control design of the original dynamic systems
may therefore be reduced remarkably. The reason why the
HTGA is applied in this paper is that Chou (the third author
of this paper) and his associates have shown that the HTGA
may obtain both the better and more robust results than those
existing improved GAs reported in the literature [20], [21]. An
illustrative example is also given in this paper to demonstrate
the applicability of the proposed integrative method.
II. PROBLEM STATEMENT
Based on the approach of using the sector nonlinearity in the
fuzzy model construction, both the fuzzy set of the premise
part and the linear dynamic model of the consequent part in
the exact TS fuzzy control model can be derived from the
given nonlinear control model [4]. The TS fuzzy-model-based
time-delay control system for the nonlinear time-delay control
system can be obtained in the following form:
R˜i : IF z1(t) is Mi1 and . . . and zg(t) is Mig,
THEN x˙(t) = Aix(t) + Aiτx(t− τ) + Biu(t) (1)
with the initial state vector x(0) and x(t)=φ(t)(for t<0),
where R˜i(i=1, 2, . . . , N) denotes the ith implication, with N
being the number of fuzzy rules; x(t)=[x1(t), x2(t), . . . ,
xn(t)]T and x(t−τ)=[x1(t− τ), x2(t−τ), . . . , xn(t−τ)]T
are the n-dimensional state vector and the n-dimensional
state vector with time delay, respectively; u(t)=[u1(t),
u2(t), . . . , up(t)]T denotes the p-dimensional input vector;
zi(t)(i=1, 2, . . . , g) are the premise variables; τ denotes the
known time delay; Ai, Aiτ , and Bi(i=1, 2, . . . , N) are the
n× n, n× n, and n× p consequent constant matrices, re-
spectively; Mij (i = 1, 2, . . . , N and j = 1, 2, . . . , g) are the
fuzzy sets; and φ(t) is an n-dimensional arbitrary known time-
function vector.
The resulting TS fuzzy-model-based time-delay dynamic
system inferred from (1) is represented as
x˙(t) =
N∑
i=1
hi (z(t))(Aix(t) + Aiτx(t− τ) + Biu(t)) (2)
in which z(t)=[z1(t), z2(t), . . . , zg(t)]T denotes the
g-dimensional premise vector, hi(z(t))=wi(z(t))/∑N
i=1 wi(z(t)), wi(z(t)) =
∏g
j=1 Mij(zj(t)), and Mij(zj(t))

where a denotes a specified positive integer with a ≤ q, k =
0, 1, 2, . . . , q − 1, and 0 ≤ η ≤ tf .
The state vector x(t) and the time-function vector φ(t−
τ), within ktf ≤ t ≤ (k + 1)tf , can be approximated by the
truncated shifted-Chebyshev-series (SCS) representations as

vector, Ti(t) (i = 0, 1, . . . ,m− 1) denote the SCS, x(k)s (s =
0, 1, . . . ,m− 1) and φ(k)s (s = 0, 1, . . . ,m− 1) are the n× 1

efficient matrices of x(t) and φ(t− τ), respectively, in which
the SCS are given as follows [18], [19]:

where r = 1, 2, 3, . . ..
By substituting (3) and the truncated SCS representation of
x(t) in (9) into the quadratic integral performance index in
(6), the quadratic integral performance index J becomes the
following algebraic form:

where the constant matrix W is the product integration matrix
of two SCS basis vectors [17].
Because, before the consequent output can be inferred within
the small time interval ktf ≤ t ≤ (k + 1)tf , the degree of
fulfillment of the antecedent must be computed in advance, so,
as in the works by Ho and Chou [18], [19], we can let the value
of hi(z(t)), within ktf ≤ t ≤ (k + 1)tf , be hi(z(ktf )).Then,
first, considering 0 ≤ ktf ≤ t ≤ (k + 1)tf ≤ τ and integrating
(2) from t = ktf to t = t within ktf ≤ t ≤ (k + 1)tf , we
obtain

Next, considering τ ≤ ktf ≤ t ≤ (k + 1)tf and integrating
(2) from t = ktf to t = t within ktf ≤ t ≤ (k + 1)tf , we
can get

problem represented by algebraic equations with constraint
of the LMI-based stabilizability condition. This means that
the main characteristic of this technique, bringing the SCSA
and the LMI-based stabilizability condition together, is that it
reduces the mixed H2/LMI PDC-controller design problem
to that of solving a static constrained optimization problem
of algebraic form, thus greatly facilitating the work of ap-
plying GAs to solve the stable and quadratic finite-horizon
optimal PDC-controller design problem. Hence, the computa-
tional complexity relies heavily on the chosen GA. By studying
some well-known test functions, Chou (the third author of this
paper) and his associates [21] have discussed the analysis of
computational complexity for applying the HTGA. Chou et al.
have also shown that the HTGA approach, compared with other
GA-based methods, has a lower computational time require-
ment and a more stable solution quality. This is the reason why
the HTGA is employed in this paper to search for the solution
of the static constrained optimization problem in (22).
IV. ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE
Consider a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) system
in which the first-order irreversible exothermic reaction occurs,
as given in the literature [6], [11]. Based on the approach of
using the sector nonlinearity in the fuzzy model construction,
both the fuzzy sets of the premise part and the linear dynamic
model of the consequent part in the TS fuzzy model can be
easily derived from the physical model of the given nonlinear
dynamic system [4]. This approach guarantees an exact fuzzy
model construction for the given nonlinear dynamic model [4].
The advantage of using the approach of sector nonlinearity is
that there is no approximation error between the original non-
linear dynamic system and its TS fuzzy-model-based dynamic
system [4]. Thus, in this example, we adopt the approach of
sector nonlinearity [4] to represent the nonlinear equation of
the CSTR system into an exact TS fuzzy-model-based time-
delay dynamic system. The exact TS fuzzy-model-based time-
delay dynamic system for the CSTR system in dimensionless
variables given by Cao and Frank [6] can be obtained as
follows:
R˜1 : IF z1(t) is M11 and z2(t) is M12,
THEN x˙(t)=A1x(t)+A1τx(t−2)+B1u(t) (23a)
R˜2 : IF z1(t) is M21 and z2(t) is M22,
THEN x˙(t)=A2x(t)+A2τx(t−2)+B2u(t) (23b)
R˜3 : IF z1(t) is M31 and z2(t) is M32,
THEN x˙(t)=A3x(t)+A3τx(t−2)+B3u(t) (23c)
R˜4 : IF z1(t) is M41 and z2(t) is M42,
THEN x˙(t)=A4x(t)+A4τx(t−2)+B4u(t) (23d)
with the initial state vector x(0) = x¯(0)− xd and with
x(t)= x¯(t)−xd =φ(t)−xd =−xd(for t<0), where x(t)=
x¯(t)− xd, x(t− 2) = x¯(t− 2)− xd, u(t) = u¯(t)− ud, u¯(t)
is a 1-D reactor control input, x¯(t) = [x¯1(t), x¯2(t)]T is a
2-D state vector, x¯1(t) corresponds to the conversion rate of the
reaction with 0 ≤ x¯1(t) ≤ 1, x¯2(t) is the dimensionless tem-
perature with 0.5 ≤ x¯2(t) ≤ 5, (xd, ud) denotes the expected
operating point, z1(t) = exp(20x2(t)/(20 + x2(t))), z2(t) =

In what follows, for the TS fuzzy-model-based time-delay
control system in (23), we will apply the proposed approach,
which integrates the SCSA, the HTGA, and the presented
LMI-based stabilizability condition, to design the stable and
quadratic optimal PDC controller such that there exist three
symmetric positive-definite matrices P , S, and Y to make LMIs
in (5) hold (i.e., such that the delay-dependent stabilizability
condition in the theorem is satisfied) and such that the quadratic
integral performance index in (24) is minimized. The evolu-
tionary environments of the HTGA used in this paper are as
follows: The population size is 100, the crossover rate is 0.8,
the mutation rate is 0.1, and the generation number is 200.
After using the proposed integrative approach and the LMI
toolbox [28] to execute five independent runs with m = 4 and
|fijk| ≤ 200, where fijk (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, j = 1, and k = 1, 2)

AND SYMMETRIC POSITIVE-DEFINITE MATRICES OBTAINED BY USING

concluded that the proposed HTGA can give a more effective
way of finding the stable and quadratic optimal PDC controllers
and can obtain the better results than the TGA.
Table VI shows the relation between the number of terms
required for the SCSA and the value of the quadratic integral
performance index. It can be seen that, when the number
of terms is more than or equal to seven, the value of the
performance index becomes steady. Here, it should be noticed
that the larger value of m shall need more computational time.
The responses for the conversion rate of reaction x1(t)
and the dimensionless temperature x2(t) of the CTSR system
with the designed stable and quadratic optimal PDC controller
are shown in Fig. 1 with x(0) = [0.4, 2.5]T and in Fig. 2
with x(0) = [0.6, 3.5]T, respectively, where the expected state
operating point is xd = [0.4472, 2.7520]T.
From Figs. 1 and 2, it can be seen that the proposed approach,
which integrates the SCSA, the HTGA, and the presented
LMI-based stabilizability condition, may obtain the satisfactory
control results.

back dynamic equations in this paper. Then, the presented
algebraic algorithm is integrated with the HTGA to design the

(2) can be stabilized by the state-feedback controller or 
not, where the feedback gain matrix F have been 
specified in advance.

designing the robust optimal state-feedback controllers 
of the TS-fuzzy-model-based control systems with 
both elemental parametric uncertainties and norm-
bounded approximation error. This work is only a 
preliminary study on designing the robust optimal 
controllers of the uncertain TS-fuzzy-model-based 
control systems. A complete and detailed study on the 
aforementioned issue will be appeared in the journal.

evaluation index, lying in the range [0, 100], that 
allows to quantify the production rate and/or the 
reliability of the designed circuit with respect to the 
variations of its own parameters. 
As for the relative position between the RA and 
the designed RT, it is worth noting that it is not 
sufficient to give rise to a 100% yield by simply 
inscribing the RT into the RA. Indeed, the true goal in 
the tolerance design is twofold: at the same time, the 
designer seeks the highest yield value and the widest 
parameters’ tolerances, namely the RT of maximum 
volume. In the large part of cases, the RA can be 
assumed convex and simply connected. Thus, the 
evolutionary strategy is adopted to make the allowable 
parameters’ tolerances as large as possible to achieve a 
100% yield by vertex analysis used to check the 
feasibility of each candidate RT. The vertex analysis 
regarded as the tolerance design can verify the 100% 
feasibility of a candidate RT. For a circuit involving N
parameters to be designed, vertex analysis provides 
that the check of feasibility is performed in all the 2N
vertices of the N-dimensional axis-aligned box in the 
parameter space. If the design constraints are met in all 
the vertices, the RT is considered as 100% feasible. 
This approach, although natural and very simple to 
implement, suffers from a severe dimensional 
dependence, since it requires 2N checks of the design 
constraints.  
For the optimal circuit tolerance design, the 
tolerance assignment and design centering can be 
merged to the aim of optimizing both central values 
and tolerances of parameters, reducing the circuit cost, 
and/or improving the circuit reliability. Indeed, a 
robust design can be attained by determining the 
widest tolerances of parameters guaranteeing 
performance specifications, and accounting for 
extreme operating conditions and parameters’ drifts. 
For example, such a task, which is to achieve 100% 
yield and at minimum cost, can be formulated as the 
following constrained optimization problem [1], [7], 
[8]:

The 100% yield can be checked by the vertex analysis. 
3. Taguchi immune algorithm 
This section describes the proposed TIA approach 
[9]. The detailed steps are as follows. 
Step 1: Parameter setting.  
Step 2: Initialization. 
Step 3: Selection mechanism. 
Step 4: Clonal proliferation within the hypermutation. 
Step 5: The antibodies, generated by the replication and 
the clonal proliferation, are included to execute 
the recombination by using the Taguchi method. 
Step 6: Taguchi-based recombination. 
Step 7: Repeat Step 6 until the expected number has 
been met. 
Step 8: The antibody population via the Taguchi-based 
recombination is generated. 
Step 9: Mutation operation. 
Step 10: New antibody population is generated. 
Step 11: Sort the objective function values in 
increasing order among the antibody 
population of last generation and the new 
antibody population of current generation. 
Step 12: Select the better ps antibodies as the new 
antibody population of the next generation. 
Step 13: Has the stopping criterion been met? If yes, 
then go to Step 14. Otherwise, return to Step 3 
and continue through Step 13. 
Step 14: Display the optimal antibody. 
4. Design example and comparisons 
In this section, we adopt the same example and 
conditions as those considered in [7] to compare the 
result and the performance. 
A high pass LC ladder filter as shown in Figure 1 
has been chosen as an example that has been widely 
used in the literature [7],[8] for the circuit tolerance 
design. The design specifications shown in Figure 2 are 
imposed on eleven frequency values of the gain 
function g(f)=°Vout(f)/Vin(f)°, normalized with respect 
to its value at the frequency f =990Hz, i.e., 
G(f)=20log10(g(f)/g(990)). They are G(170)d45,
G(350)d 49, G(440)d 42, –4dG(630)d0.05, and –
1.75dG(f)d0.05 for f ={650, 720, 740, 760, 940, 1040, 
1800}Hz. 
The objective function described below has been 
defined referring to the circuit cost in (2.1).

3. Genetic algorithm method 
3.1. Selection method
Better parents are selected for a subsequent 
crossover operation, and a roulette wheel [10], is 
utilized for the selection. The selection operation 
selects individuals with higher probabilities in the 
entire group. For example, for individual k, its fitness 
value is fk and its probability in the entire group is Pk
 (3.1.1) .,...,2,1/

ikk   ¦
 
Therefore, an accumulated probability qk of each set 
of chromosome in the entire group as follows:  
  (3.1.2) .,...,2,1
1
Mkpq
k
i
ik   ¦
 
M is the number of individuals in the group. During 
the selection operation, the roulette wheel is turned 
M×Pe times, where Pe is a selection rate, and a 
member from the parent is selected to become a new 
member of the group according to each obtained 
probability. The following steps show how to generate 
M×Pe new group members. 
3.2. Crossover method
The one-cut-point crossover is integrated with an 
arithmetical operator derived from convex set theory 
[11] [12], which randomly selects one cut-point, 
exchanges the right parts of two parents after the cut-
point, and calculates the linear combinations at the cut-
point genes to generate new offspring. For example, let 
two parents be x = (x1, x2, …, xN) and y = (y1, y2, …, 
yN ). If they are crossed after the kth position, the 
resulting offspring defined as:
)...,,,,'...,,,('

Where: lk and uk: The domain of yk. E: The random 
value, in which E {0, 0.1, 0.2, …, 1}. 
3.3. Mutation method
As the method of section 3.2, which randomly 
selects two points from the same group in one 
chromosome, performs linear interpolation to complete 
the mutation. This mutation method may also be 
viewed as performing a fine tuning in the space. 
For example: the parent is x = (x1, x2, ... , xi,  xj,  xk,
, x... n); xi and xk are randomly selected for mutation; 
wherein, xi and xk need to be in the same range, or 
otherwise need to be normalized. The mutation method 
and new daughter x' are explained in the following: 
  kxixix EE  1'    (3.3.1) 
  kxixkx EE  1'    (3.3.2) 
),...,',,',...,2,1(' nxkxjxixxxx    (3.3.3) 
Wherein, E {0, 0.1, 0.2, ... , 1}, and xi', xk' are 
rounded to be integers. 
3.4. Competition method 
 The example in figure 2 is used to explain the 
competition method. The first population has five 
chromosomes and there are four chromosomes to be 
generated after finishing the evaluation of fitness, 
selection, crossover and mutation. All the 
chromosomes would be ranked from best to worst and 
the top five chromosomes would be reserved as the 
new population.
