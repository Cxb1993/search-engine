A. System modeling and problem formulation
A nonlinear stochastic system can be divided into several
local linear stochastic systems according to their operation
regions. Local linear systems using ARX, ARMAX, and NAR-
MAX models to approximate nonlinear stochastic systems can
be referred to [21][18][19][15]. A fuzzy stochastic model can
be employed to interpolate local linear stochastic systems for
a nonlinear stochastic system via the smoothing of fuzzy basis
functions. This fuzzy stochastic model is described by fuzzy if-
then rules and will be used here to deal with the stochastic
tracking problem of nonlinear stochastic systems. The i-th
rule of this fuzzy stochastic model for nonlinear discrete-time
stochastic systems is proposed as the following fuzzy ARMAX
form:
Plant Rule i:
If z1(k) is Fi1 and · · · · · · and zg0(k) is Fig0 ,
then Ai(q−1)y(k + 1) = Bi(q−1)u(k) + Ci(q−1)w(k + 1)
(1)
for i = 1, 2, ..., L, where Fij is the fuzzy set, z1(k), z2(k),
· · · , zg0 (k) are the premise variables, and L is the number of
if-then rules. Polynomials Ai(q−1), Bi(q−1), and Ci(q−1) are
deﬁned, respectively, as follows
Ai(q−1) = ai0 + ai1q−1 + ......+ ainq−n, ai0 = 1
Bi(q−1) = bi0 + bi1q−1 + ......+ bimq−m,
Ci(q−1) = ci0 + ci1q−1 + ci2q−2 + ......+ cilq−l, ci0 = 1
(2)
for i = 1, 2, ..., L where q−1 denotes the delay operator, i.e.,
q−1y(k) = y(k − 1). Without loss of generality, Ci(q−1) can
be taken to have roots inside the unit circle [12][13]. y(k) is
the output measurement, u(k) the control input, and the noise
process w(k) will be taken to satisfy the following assumptions
[12][13]:
E[w(k + 1)| zk] = 0, a. s. (3)
E[w2(k + 1)| zk] = σ2w, a. s. (4)
lim sup

N∑
k=1
w2(k) ≤ Kw <∞, a. s. (5)
where E denotes the expectation, zk denotes the sub-σ al-
gebra generated from the data set {y(s)}s≤k. Note that zk
is increasing, i.e., zk ⊂ zk+1. We also assume that u(k) is
zk−measurable. For the premise variables zi(k), 1 ≤ i ≤ g0,
we assume that they are zk−measurable, i.e., zi(k) depends
on the data set {y(s), u(s)}s≤k. Using the smoothing property
of the conditional mean [22], conditions (3) and (4) imply that
w(k) is also a white process with zero mean and variance σ2w.
Note that condition (5) implies

N
N∑
k=1
w2(k) ≤ Kw, a.s., for N ≥ Nw (6)
where Nw is a sufﬁciently large integer.
Given the input/output sequences {u(k)} and {y(k)}, the
stochastic fuzzy system (1) is equivalent to
y(k + 1) =
L∑
i=1
hi(z(k))
{
(1−Ai(q−1))y(k + 1)
+Bi(q−1)u(k) + Ci(q−1)w(k + 1)
}
(7)
where z(k) = [z1(k) z2(k) ... zg0(k)] and, for 1 ≤ i ≤ L,
µi(z(k)) =
g0∏
j=1
Fij(zj(k)) (8)
hi(z(k)) =
µi(z(k))∑L
i=1 µi(z(k))
(9)
Where the function Fij(zj(k)) is the grade of membership of
zj(k) in Fij . For (8) and (9), we assume that
hi(z(k)) ≥ 0 ,
L∑
i=1
hi(z(k)) = 1 (10)
The physical meaning of (7) is that the L local linear stochas-
tic subsystems are interpolated by the fuzzy basis functions
hi(z(k)), for i = 1, 2, . . . , L.
In the sequel, we shall ﬁrst attack the identiﬁcation problem
for estimating the parameters related to the fuzzy ARMAX
model (1). To attack this problem, we shall need some math-
ematical tools concerning the stochastic stability of the T-S
stochastic fuzzy system. After obtaining the estimates of the
parameters, the design objective for the stochastic fuzzy system
in (7) is to determine the adaptive control input u(k) so as to
bring the output y(k+1) to optimally track a desired bounded
output command y∗(k + 1), which is speciﬁed beforehand.
Based on the identiﬁed parameters, the control objective is to
choose the input u(k), as a function of {y(s), u(s− 1)}s≤k, to
minimize
J1(k + 1) = E{[y(k + 1)− y∗(k + 1)]2 + λu2(k)|zk} (11)
B. Stability of Stochastic T-S Fuzzy Systems
In order to deal with the identiﬁcation problem of the T-S
stochastic fuzzy system, the stability issue of the stochastic
fuzzy system must be addressed ﬁrst. The results will be
used in the sequel for analysis of the optimal predictor and
the identiﬁcation algorithm for the stochastic fuzzy ARMAX
model. Since the fuzzy ARMAX model, such as in (7), can
be transformed into a state-space stochastic fuzzy model and
stability is easier to discuss from the state-space perspective,
we consider a forced T-S fuzzy system in the state-space form
as follows
x(k + 1) =
L∑
i=1
hi(z(k))Aix(k) + v(k + 1) (12)
where {v(k)} is the stochastic forced term. It is assumed that
{v(k)} is zk−measurable. Recall that z(k) is zk−measurable,
i.e., E {hi(z(k))|zk} = hi(z(k)) a.s. Then x(k) is also
Note that the following general T-S fuzzy state-space system
x(k + 1) =
L∑
i=1
hi(z(k)) [Aix(k) +Bius(k)]
ys(k) =
L∑
i=1
hi(z(k)) [Cix(k) +Dius(k)]
(26)
is a special case of the systems in (24) by identifying
A(k) =
L∑
i=1
hi(z(k))Ai, B(k) =
L∑
i=1
hi(z(k))Bi
C(k) =
L∑
i=1
hi(z(k))Ci, D(k) =
L∑
i=1
hi(z(k))Di
Therefore, by combining the results in Corollary 1, Corollary 2,
and Theorem 2, the following corollary can be easily obtained.
Corollary 3: If there exist symmetric positive deﬁnite matri-
ces Pi, 1 ≤ i ≤ L, such that the matrix inequality (19) holds for
some λ with 0 < λ < 1, then, for the stochastic fuzzy system
(26), the inequality (25) holds.
Stability analysis of the state-space stochastic fuzzy system
(12) is very useful for the optimal tracking design of the fuzzy
ARMAX model in (7). For system identiﬁcation based on the
prediction error method [26] for the fuzzy ARMAX model, the
optimal fuzzy prediction must be ﬁrst established as in the next
section.
C. Optimal predictor of stochastic fuzzy systems
In this section, the prediction problem of the fuzzy ARMAX
model in (7) will be addressed. This will result in a fuzzy
predictor model which will be suitable for parameter estimation
and optimal tracking design of fuzzy ARMAX systems. The
optimal fuzzy predictor for the fuzzy ARMAX model has
been studied in [27]. The results in that reference are brieﬂy
summarized in the following.
Assumption 1: Let ΞC,i be the companion matrix associated
with the polynomial Ci(q−1). Assume that there exist symmet-
ric positive matrices PC,i, 1 ≤ i ≤ L, such that the set of
matrix inequalities[
λCPC,i ΞTC,iPC,j
PC,jΞC,i PC,j
]
> 0, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ L (27)
is solvable for some λC with 0 < λC < 1.
A fuzzy polynomial
∑L
i=1 hi(z(k))Ci(q
−1) with Ci(q−1)
being manic and hi(·) satisfying (10) is stable if the LMI
condition (27) holds.
Let y0(k + 1|k) denote the conditional mean of y(k + 1)
given the data set {u(s), y(s)}s≤k, i.e., y0(k + 1| k) ,
E {y(k + 1)| zk} . Deﬁne the polynomial αi(q−1), 1 ≤ i ≤ L,
as
Ci(q−1)−Ai(q−1) = q−1αi(q−1) (28)
where
αi(q−1) = αi0 + αi1q−1 + · · ·+ q−(n−1), n = max(n, l)
Under Assumption 1 on the fuzzy ARMAX model (7), the
optimal one-step ahead predictor of y(k+1) given the data set
{u(s), y(s)}s≤k is y0(k + 1| k) which satisﬁes the following
equation
y0(k + 1|k) =
L∑
i=1
hi(z(k)){
[
1− Ci(q−1)
]
y0(k + 1|k)
+ αi(q−1)y(k) +Bi(q−1)u(k)} (29)
with the prediction error
y(k + 1)− y0(k + 1|k) = w(k + 1) (30)
Equation (29) deﬁnes a unique one-step ahead fuzzy pre-
diction model corresponding to the fuzzy ARMAX model (7).
From human-operation point of view, the fuzzy prediction
model is more feasible than the fuzzy ARMAX model since we
can use the current and past measurement data {u(s), y(s)}s≤k
to predict the future response y(k + 1) of the stochastic fuzzy
system; while using the fuzzy ARMAX model (7), the statistical
properties of the noise process w(k) should be speciﬁed in
advance.
D. Stochastic Gradient Algorithm
Following from the fuzzy prediction model represented by
(29), the stochastic gradient algorithm in [13] will be used to
identify the parameters. First, rearrange the prediction model
(29) as follows
y0(k + 1|k) =
L∑
i=1
hi(z(k))χT0 (k)θi0 = φ
T
0 (k)θ0 (31)
where, for 1 ≤ i ≤ L,
χ0(k) =
[−y0(k|k − 1) · · · − y0(k − l + 1|k − l)
y(k) · · · y(k − n+ 1) u(k) · · ·u(k −m)]T
θi0 =
[
ci1 · · · cil αi0 · · ·αi(n−1) bi0 · · · bim
]T
φ0(k) =
[
h1(z(k))χT0 (k) h2(z(k))χ
T
0 (k)
· · · · · ·hL(z(k))χT0 (k))
]T
θ0 =
[
θT10 θ
T
20 · · · · · · θTL0
]T
Note that (31) represents a pseudo linear regression form for the
fuzzy ARMAX prediction model (29) because the component
y0(k − i + 1|k − i) in χ0(k) depends on the true parameter
vector θ0. According to the pseudo linear regression form (31),
the proposed stochastic gradient algorithm to identify the true
parameter vector θ0 is given by, for k ≥ 1,
θ̂(k) = θ̂(k − 1) + φ(k − 1)
r(k − 2) + φT (k − 1)φ(k − 1)
×
[
y(k)− φT (k − 1)θ̂(k − 1)
]
(32)
where the regression vector φ(k) and r (k − 1) are deﬁned as
φ(k) =
[
h1(z(k))χT (k) h2(z(k))χT (k)
· · · · · · hL(z(k))χT (k)
]T
(33)
χ(k) = [−y(k) · · · − y(k − l + 1)
y(k) · · · y(k − n+ 1) u(k) · · ·u(k −m)]T (34)
y(k) = φT (k − 1)θ̂(k) (35)
r(k − 1) = r(k − 2) + φT (k − 1)φ(k − 1) (36)
function in (11) is given by
u(k)
=
b0(k)
b20(k) + λ
{
L∑
i=1
hi(z(k))[Ci(q−1)− 1]y0(k + 1|k)
+ y∗(k + 1)−
L∑
i=1
hi(z(k))αi(q−1)y(k)
−
L∑
i=1
hi(z(k))[Bi(q−1)− bi0]u(k)
}
(54)
which is equivalent to
b0(k)
[
y0(k + 1|k)− y∗(k + 1)]+ λu(k) = 0 (55)
The dynamics of the closed-loop system is governed by
u(k) =
b0(k)
λ
[w(k + 1)− y(k + 1) + y∗(k + 1)] (56)
and
L∑
i=1
hi(z(k))
[
Ai(q−1) +Bi(q−1)
b0(k)
λ
]
y(k + 1)
=
L∑
i=1
hi(z(k))Bi(q−1)
b0(k)
λ
y∗(k + 1)
+
L∑
i=1
hi(z(k))
[
Bi(q−1)
b0(k)
λ
+ Ci(q−1)
]
w(k + 1)
(57)
Now suppose that the estimated parameters, α̂ij(k), bˆij(k),
and cˆij(k) are obtained by using the stochastic gradient algo-
rithm at time k. Accordingly, deﬁne the following polynomials
α̂i(k, q−1) = α̂i0(k) + α̂i1(k)q−1 + ......+ α̂i(n−1)(k)q−(n−1),
Bˆi(k, q−1) = bˆi0(K) + bˆi1(k)q−1 + ......+ bˆim(k)q−m,
Cˆi(k, q−1) = 1 + cˆi1(k)q−1 + cˆi2(k)q−2 + ......+ cˆil(k)q−l,
with ci0 = 1. Let b̂0(k) =
∑L
i=1 hi(z(k))bˆi0(k). Based on the
above estimated polynomials, the weighted adaptive minimum
variance control law under the certainty equivalent principle is
given by
u(k) =
bˆ0(k)
bˆ20(k) + λ
{
L∑
i=1
hi(z(k))[Ĉi(q−1)− 1]y¯(k + 1)
+ y∗(k + 1)−
L∑
i=1
hi(z(k))αˆi(q−1)y(k)
−
L∑
i=1
hi(z(k))[B̂i(q−1)− bˆi0]u(k)
}
(58)
in which the control law is derived from the following equation
bˆ0(k)
λ
[
φT (k)θ̂(k)− y∗(k + 1)
]
+ u(k) = 0 (59)
F. Analysis of Stability
In this section, closed-loop stability of the proposed adaptive
stochastic fuzzy control system will be discussed. First, we
rewrite the equation concerning the adaptive control law in (59)
as
u(k) =
bˆ0(k)
λ
[e(k + 1) + y∗(k + 1)− y(k + 1)] (60)
Now applying the operator
∑L
i=1 hi(z(k))Bi(q
−1) to both sides
of the above equation and using the system equation (7), we
can obtain
L∑
i=1
hi(z(k))
[
Ai(q−1) +Bi(q−1)
bˆ0(k)
λ
]
y(k + 1)
=
L∑
i=1
hi(z(k))Bi(q−1)
bˆ0(k)
λ
× [y∗(k + 1) + e(k + 1)− w(k + 1)]
+
L∑
i=1
hi(z(k))
[
Ci(q−1) +Bi(q−1)
bˆ0(k)
λ
]
w(k + 1)
(61)
To analyze the closed-loop response of y(k) from the above
equation, the estimated term bˆ0(k) imposes a difﬁcult issue.
Therefore, as done in [28], we assume the following assump-
tion.
Assumption 3: (i) Assume that b0,i is known for 1 ≤ i ≤ L
in the fuzzy model and these exists positive number b0,min and
b0,max such that 0 < b0,min ≤ b0,i ≤ b0,max and 0 < b0,min ≤
|b0(k)| ≤ b0,max.
Based on Assumption 3, it is possible to ﬁnd a constant γ0
such that
0 <
λ
λ+ b20(k)
≤ γ0 ≤ 1 (62)
Also, the closed-loop system equation in (61) becomes
L∑
i=1
hi(z(k))
[
Ai(q−1) +Bi(q−1)
b0(k)
λ
]
y(k + 1)
=
L∑
i=1
hi(z(k))Bi(q−1)
b0(k)
λ
× [y∗(k + 1) + e(k + 1)− w(k + 1)]
+
L∑
i=1
hi(z(k))
[
Ci(q−1) +Bi(q−1)
b0(k)
λ
]
w(k + 1)
(63)
Without loss of generality, assume that n = max(n,m). Then,
Ai(q−1) and Bi(q−1) will be regarded as polynomials of
degree n where the extra coefﬁcients bij for n ≥ j > m are
identiﬁed as zeros. Let ΞAi be the companion matrix associated
with the polynomial Ai(q−1) , −γ0Ai(q−1) with degree n.
Corresponding to the polynomial Bi(q−1) with degree n, deﬁne
a matrix MBi as
MBi =

四、結論與討論
Adaptive weighted minimum variance control for stochastic
T-S fuzzy ARMAX model is addressed in this study. From
the fuzzy ARMAX model, a fuzzy one-step ahead prediction
model is ﬁrst developed. A stochastic gradient algorithm is
then proposed to identify the parameters of the related one-
step-ahead predictor. Under the direct adaptive control scheme,
weighted minimum variance control is applied to ﬁnd the
control law to make the output track a desired reference signal.
Stability of the adaptive stochastic fuzzy control system is
rigorously derived. Simulation study is also made to verify the
developed results.

A. Proof of Theorem 1
Proof: First deﬁne a Lyapunov function as
V (x(k)) = xT (k)P(k)x(k) (74)
which is uniformly positive deﬁnite and
λminP ‖x(k)‖2 ≤ V (x(k)) ≤ λmaxP ‖x(k)‖2 (75)
With the deﬁnition of V (x(k)), it follows that
V (x(k + 1)) = xT (k)
[
AT (k)P(k + 1)A(k)
]
x(k) (76)
Note that the terms x(k), P(k), and A(k) are all
zk−measurable. Now applying the conditional mean operator
E {· | zk} to the both sides of (76) and using (15), we have,
With the transition matrix deﬁned in (21), it follows that
‖Φ(k, k − i+ 1)‖ ≤ Ai−1L for i ≤ K1. On the other hand,
for i > K1, inequality (23) ensures that ‖Φ(k, k − i+ 1)‖ ≤

C. Proof of Lemma 1
Proof: (i) Using (36), we can get
∞∑
k=1

θ̂(k) = θ̂(k−1)+ φ(k − 1)
r(k − 2) + φT (k − 1)φ(k − 1) [y(k)− ŷ(k)]
Then multiply φT (k − 1) to both sides of the above equation
and use (38) to get
φT (k − 1) θ̂(k) = φT (k − 1) θ̂(k−1)+φ
T (k − 1)φ(k − 1)
r(k − 1) e (k)
Subtracting y (k) from both sides of the above equation, we
have
y(k)− y(k) = y(k)− ŷ(k)− φ
T (k − 1)φ(k − 1)
r(k − 1) e (k)
Using (36) and (38), we can get the following equation
η (k) =
(
1− φ
T (k − 1)φ(k − 1)
r(k − 1)
)
e (k)
=
r(k − 2)
r(k − 1)e (k)
This completes the proof.
(iii) From (32), (36), and (37), we can get
θ̂(k) = θ̂(k − 1) + φ(k − 1)
r(k − 1) e (k) (86)
Subtracting θ0 from (86) and multiplying by w (k)φT (k − 1)
give
w (k)φT (k − 1) θ˜ (k) = w (k)φT (k − 1) θ˜ (k − 1)
+
(
φT (k − 1)φ(k − 1)
r(k − 1)
× [e (k)− w (k) + w (k)]w (k))
(87)
Now taking the conditional mean E{· | zk−1} on (87), we have
E {−β (k)w (k) | zk−1}
= E
{
w (k)φT (k − 1) θ˜ (k − 1) | zk−1
}
+ E
{
φT (k − 1)φ(k − 1)
r(k − 1)
× [e (k)− w (k) + w (k)]w (k) | zk−1}
(88)
Particularly, by (38), the term e (k)−w (k) can be represented
as
e (k)− w (k) = y (k)− ŷ (k)− w (k)
=
L∑
i=1
hi (z (k − 1))
{
(1−Ai(q−1))y(k)
+Bi(q−1)u(k − 1)
+Ci(q−1)w(k)
}− ŷ (k)− w (k)
=
L∑
i=1
hi (z (k − 1))
{
(1−Ai(q−1))y(k)
+Bi(q−1)u(k − 1)
+
[
Ci(q−1)− 1
]
w(k)
}− ŷ (k) (89)
Note that the fact that S1(k) ≥ 0 for all k follows from Lemma
2 under Assumption 2. With the above notations, the second
term on the right hand side of (96) can be represented as
g1(k)
r(k − 2) =
S1(k)− S1(k − 1)
r(k − 2) (98)
and the third one can be represented by
g2(k)
r(k − 2) = S2(k)− S2(k − 1) (99)
and the ﬁnal one can be represented by
φT (k − 1)φ(k − 1)
r2(k − 2) η
2(k) = S3 (k)− S3 (k − 1) (100)
By using (97)-(100), inequality (96) implies
X(k) = (X(k − 1) + S1(k − 1) (101)
×[ 1
r(k − 2) −
1
r(k − 3) ]−
2β(k)w(k)
r(k − 2)
)
X(k) ≤ X(k − 1)− 2β(k)w(k)
r(k − 2) (102)
where the nonnegative process X(k) is deﬁned as
X(k) = V (k) +
S1(k)
r(k − 2) + S2(k) + S3(k) (103)
Now taking the conditional mean E{· | zk−1} on (102) and
using (45), we have
E{X(k) | zk−1} ≤ X(k−1)+2φ
T (k − 1)φ(k − 1)
r(k − 1)r(k − 2) σ
2
w, a. s.
(104)
With inequality (43), we can invoke the martingale convergence
theorem [13] to obtain that
lim
k→∞
X(k) = X <∞, a. s. (105)
Almost sure convergence of the nonnegative process X(k) to a
bounded nonnegative random variable X implies
lim
N→∞
N∑
k=1
ς2(k)
r(k − 2) <∞, a. s. (106)
lim
N→∞
N∑
k=1
φT (k − 1)φ(k − 1)
r2(k − 2) η
2(k) <∞, a. s. (107)
Now following from (94), we have∥∥∥θ̂(k)− θ̂(k − 1)∥∥∥2 = ∥∥∥∥φ(k − 1)r(k − 2) η(k)
∥∥∥∥2
=
φT (k − 1)φ(k − 1)
r2(k − 2) η
2(k) <∞
Therefore, by using (107), inequality (48) can be ensured.
After multiplying φT (k− 1) to and subtracting y(k)−w(k)
from (94), we can get
ς(k) +
φT (k − 1)φ(k − 1)
r(k − 2) η(k) = e(k)− w(k)
By Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, it follows
[e(k)− w(k)]2 ≤ 2ς2(k) + 2[φ
T (k − 1)φ(k − 1)]2
r2(k − 2) η
2(k)
and hence
N∑
k=1
(e(k)− w(k))2
r(k − 1)
≤ 2
N∑
k=1
ς2(k)
r(k − 1) + 2
N∑
k=1
[φT (k − 1)φ(k − 1)]2
r(k − 1)r2(k − 2) η
2(k)
≤ 2
N∑
k=1
ς2(k)
r(k − 2) + 2
N∑
k=1
φT (k − 1)φ(k − 1)
r2(k − 2) η
2(k)
Therefore, using (106) and (107), the last inequality leads to
(49). The completes the proof.
F. Proof of Lemma 3
Proof: (i) Assume r(k − 1) < kq <∞, then (49) implies
lim
N→∞
N∑
k=1
[e(k)− w(k)]2 <∞ a.s. (108)
With (108), we can apply Kronecker’s Lemma in appendix
D of [13] to get
lim
N→∞
1
N
N∑
k=1
k [e(k)− w(k)]2 = 0 a.s.
which implies (51).
On the other hand, if r(k − 1) is unbounded. By applying
Kronecker’s Lemma again, we obtain
lim
N→∞
1
r(N − 1)
N∑
k=1
r(k − 1) [e(k)− w(k)]
2
r(k − 1)
= lim
N→∞
N
r(N − 1) ×
1
N
N∑
k=1
[e(k)− w(k)]2 = 0 a.s.
(109)
Substituting of (50) into (109) gives
lim
N→∞
1
N
N∑
k=1
[e(k)− w(k)]2
Ka1 + Ka2N
N∑
k=1
[e(k)− w(k)]2
= 0 a.s. (110)
From (110), we can easily get (51).
(ii) Substituting (51) into (50), we can get (52).
(iii) For the left hand side of (53), we have
E
{
[y(k)− ŷ(k)]2 | zk−1
}
= E
{
[y (k)− ŷ (k)− w(k) + w(k)]2 | zk−1
}
= E
{
[y(k)− ŷ(k)− w(k)]2
+2 [y(k)− ŷ(k)− w(k)]w(k)
+w2(k) | zk−1
}
a.s. (111)
Since y(k) − w(k) and ŷ(k) are zk−1−measurable and
E {w(k) | zk−1} = 0, we can obtain
E
{
[y (k)− ŷ (k)]2 | zk−1
}
= [e(k)− w(k)]2 + E {w2(k) | zk−1} a.s. (112)
where K1 is a sufﬁciently large number. Next, by the deﬁnition
of v3(k),the boundedness of y∗(k), and the mean-square bound-
edness of w(k) given in (5), it follows that there are constants
K8 and K9 such that
1
N
N∑
k=1
y2(k) ≤ K8
N
N∑
k=1
[e(k)− w(k)]2+K9, a.s., for N ≥ K1
(ii) Using (43) and (44), equation (39) gives
y(k) = e(k) + y∗(k)− r(k − 2)
r(k − 1)e(k)
=
φT (k − 1)φ(k − 1)
r(k − 1) e(k) + y
∗(k)
=
φT (k − 1)φ(k − 1)
r(k − 1) [e(k)− w(k)]
+
φT (k − 1)φ(k − 1)
r(k − 1) w(k) + y
∗(k)
< [e(k)− w(k)] + w(k) + y∗(k) (120)
By Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, it follows
y2(k) ≤ 3 [e(k)− w(k)]2 + 3w2(k) + 3y∗2(k)
Similar to the proof in part (i), inequality (70) can be
concluded.
(iii) First, note that from the equation concerning the adaptive
control law u(k) deﬁned in (60), we have
u(k) =
b0(k)
λ
[e(k + 1) + y∗(k + 1)− y(k + 1)]
=
b0(k)
λ
[e(k + 1)− w(k + 1) + w(k + 1)
+y∗(k + 1)− y(k + 1)]
which implies that
1
N
N∑
k=1
u2(k) ≤ K4
N
N∑
k=1
[e(k)− w(k)]2 + K5
N
N∑
k=1
y2(k) +K6, a.s.
≤ K7
N
N∑
k=1
[e(k)− w(k)]2 +K7a (121)
In (36) with k = N , we have
r(N − 1) = r(0) +
N−1∑
k=1
φT (N − 1)φ(N − 1)
= r(0) +
N−1∑
k=1
L∑
i=1
h2i (z(k))χ
T (k)χ(k)
≤ r(0) +
N−1∑
k=1
L∑
i=1
hi(z(k))χT (k)χ(k)
= r(0) +
N−1∑
k=1
χT (k)χ(k) (122)
By the deﬁnition of χ(k) in (34), it follows from (121), (69),
and (70) that, for N ≥ N,
1
N
r(N − 1) ≤ Ka2
N
N−1∑
k=1
[e(k)− w(k)]2 +Ka1
for some positive numbers Ka2 and Ka1. This completes the
proof. ¤
