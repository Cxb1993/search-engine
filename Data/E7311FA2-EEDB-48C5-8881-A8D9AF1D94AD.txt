little common context among these methods.  One noticeable example is that despite the 
appeal of data envelopment analysis (DEA) and a history of 25 years of theoretical and 
applied research, most practitioners still utilize output-input ratio analysis for performance 
assessment. Therefore, the ultimate objective of the proposed research is to develop a 
theoretical framework which integrates different performance metrics. In particular, this one 
year project is trying to develop a theory to reconcile different performance metrics, 
especially focusing on traditional ratio analysis and DEA.   
A ratio productivity, or so-called single-factor productivity or, simply, output-input ratio, 
is the ratio of only one output to only one input, e.g. order fulfillment per labor hour, or 
customers served per dollar of cost (Agrell and Wikner, 1996; Bhargava et al., 1994; 
Brinkerhoff and Dressler, 1990; Fabricant, 1983, Kendrick, 1977; Lyons, 1995). The 
associated term for relative comparison is ratio efficiency (RE), which is the ratio of a ratio 
productivity value to some reference value, such as the corresponding “best in class” ratio 
productivity based on this specific productivity definition. 
The main problem for ratio productivity or ratio efficiency is a lack of inclusiveness 
since each ratio only catches a piece of the whole picture. To resolve single-factor measures’ 
weakness, a set of ratios can be sued to represent all aspects related to the DMU. For example, 
in financial the analysis, we are looking at many different index (ROI, ROA, etc) for different 
managerial aspects. The main disadvantage is that the ratio measures in this family usually 
are not consistent with each other (Bhargava et al., 1994; Lyons, 1995; Martin and Roman, 
2001). Though listing a set of measures may cover all pertinent aspects, the lack of 
convergence makes evaluating overall performance difficult. 
Non-parametric approaches consider multiple inputs and outputs simultaneously, but, in 
contrast to TFP, DEA requires neither a priori weights nor a prespecified functional form. 
One of the well-known approach, DEA, is in this category.  DEA, introduced by Charnes et 
al. in 1978, is a mathematical programming based approach that evaluates the efficiencies of 
an organization or, in general, a decision making unit (DMU) relative to a set of comparable 
organizations. However, instead of calculating the productivity for a particular DMU, DEA 
constructs an empirical production possibility set (EPPS) and an efficient frontier, and 
provides a single efficiency score for that DMU by comparing to a “virtual producer” on the 
frontier. Since it was introduced, there have been over 3000 publications concerning DEA 
including more than 1200 journal papers and 171 dissertations by the end of year 2001 
(Tavares 2002). 
While DEA has been studied for the last two decades and used in a large number of 
special studies in specific industries, it is NOT used as a routine performance assessment tool 
in practice. To the contrast, ratio analysis is still the most widely-used performance 
assessment approach today in practice. Surprisingly, these two approaches with the same 
purposes are disconnected. The proposed research is to bridge the disconnection among 
different performance assessments. With the theoretical connection built, we are able to have 
better understanding of performance assessment and resolve the addressed problems.     
There is limited literature on the relationship between DEA and ratio productivity or 
efficiency measurements. Most of the published work on this issue presents empirical 
comparisons of DEA and ratio productivity metrics. Some authors use the same data set to 
check (1) the consistency between these two approaches, and (2) the consistency with the 
overall economic performance, or the goal of the organizations. For instance, Schefczyk 
(1993) compares ratio productivity and DEA in a study of warehouse performance. Lyons 
(1995) compares the ratio measures, total factor productivity (TFP) and DEA using a data set 
for urban transit. Thanassoulis et al. (1996) study the district health authorities (DHA) in the 
UK. Yeh (1996) studies bank performance in Taiwan. Worthington (1998) compares the 
financial performance of thirty Australian gold producers based on accounting-based ratios

For example, Banker et al. (1984) show that )(* kcθ  actually is the product of pure technical 
efficiency TE(k) and scale efficiency (SE(k)), which measures how far DMU k is from the 
most productive scale size. This leads to )(* kcθ = TE(k)×SE(k) that reveals system structure, 
namely, the technical efficiency and scale economics. Other possible decompositions of 
)(* kcθ , e.g. productivity changes (Fare et al., 1994, 1997), congestion or weight restriction, 
are related to system-based structural issues and not out of the scope of this study.

Decomposition of Ratio Efficiency 
The RE is the efficiency measure obtained from conventional ratio analysis. Consider the 
output-input ratio metric in which input )( ixi  and output )( jyj  are of interest; the RE for 
any DMU k∈S is defined as RE (i,j,k) ( )

. The theoretical relationship between RE 
and DEA can be built by decomposing RE under the non-parametric frontier analysis 
framework. In this report, we only facilitate the idea of decomposition by Figures 1 and 2, 
detail definitions and proofs have been done but cannot be addressed because of the length of 
the report.

2-output (yj and yq) illustration; in both,

DMU k∈S with (xk,yk), RE (i,j,k) suggests to reduce xi or increase yj to achieve the best ratio

. As shown in Figure 1, without changing outputs, yk, DMU k can reduce its input i 
from xik to xib’, which is the minimum possible of xi to produce yk. This reduction generally 
contains three parts: 
First, from xik to xid is system-based since the reduction is possible while keeping the input 
mix the same. In addition, other inputs are also reduced by 100×
ik

x %. The second part, from 
xid to xie, is due to the excess of xi over the amount necessary to produce yk and xid− xie is 
called the slack of input i. The third part of the reduction, from xie to xib’, requires to increase 
at least one another input, e.g., xp in Figure 1. That is using other inputs as the substitute so 
that xi can be reduced while keeping yk the same, and thus, this part is due to the input 
substitution.

argument, we have yn=

x yb produced by kxˆ  efficiently as well. By scaling yk and yb as 
shown in Figure 2, they are both in the output set using resource kxˆ , in which all resources 
but xi are unconstrained, system-based efficiently. 
Figure 2 shows that to fill the gap between 
ik

y
 to 
ib
jb

y
, one can reduce xi from xik to xib 
(if possible) while keeping yib, or increase yj from yjk to yjn with xik fixed. The part yjk to yjh 
representing the result of the first stage, and to fill the remaining gap yjh to yjn includes two 
parts: 
The first part, yjh to yjm is the slack of output j, which is the extra amount of yj can be 
produced by xik with the others resources always available. The part of from yjm to yjn is the 
maximum extra amount of output j can be; however, it requires sacrificing at least one 
another outputs, which can substitute with yj, to transform to yj. Thus this part is due to the 
substitution effect of outputs. 
Similar to Figure 1, the input-oriented stage, metrics measuring the magnitude of the two 
parts can be defined. Corresponding to yjh and yjm, OSlk(i,j,k) =
ih

y
 is the output slack factor, 
which measures the “pure” slack effect of output j. OSub(i,j,k) =
jm
in
y
y is the output substitution 
factor. Clearly, we have OSlk(i,j,k) ≥ 1 and OSub(i,j,k) ≥ 1. OSlk(i,j,k) = 1 and OSub(i,j,k) = 1 
indicate that there is no slack of yj and it is impossible to transform other outputs to yj, 
respectively. 
Therefore, the last term of the right hand size of (1) can be rewritten as

Ratio efficiency can be decomposed as five factors including input/output slacks, input/output 
substitution and system-based efficiency, which can be further decomposed in a system-based 
context as shown in many earlier literature. 
 
Implementation 
The conceptual decomposition has been implemented by Matlab. The information 
retrieved from the decomposition can be implemented as diagnosis tool for ratio analysis. 
Figure 3 is an example, in which ratio using output A and input B is of interests. The gap of 
this particular ratio to the best in class is 82%, i.e., this particular DMU is only 18% as good 
as the best in class. The information of the decomposition provides further insights on how to 
fill the performance gap. Some parts of the gap are resulted from long term strategic aspect 
such as product mix (40%) or resource allocation (17%). Some parts are due to short term 
operational reasons. It is important to understand the causes of the gap before setting targets 
for improvements.
