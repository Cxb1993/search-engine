1. Introduction 
Lipases, a class of enzymes belonging to the serine hydrolases, have proven to be efficient 
for resolving racemic alcohols and esters. Many lipases are heat-stable and they do not need 
co-factors. They can often be used in organic solvents. It is of general interest to use 
molecular modeling for predicting the ability of these enzymes to discriminate between the 
enantiomers of a substrate. With the help of such a method, a suitable lipase can be chosen for 
a particular substrate. Molecular modeling can also be used for guidance on redesigning the 
enzyme by site-directed mutagenesis in order to improve or change the capability of the 
enzyme to accomplish a specific enantioselective transformation. 
Lipase structures have been determined during the last few years. Structure-function 
relationship studies by means of molecular graphics and molecular modeling are thus possible. 
Several of the lipases have been covalently inhibited by different phosphonates that mimic the 
tetrahedral intermediate along the reaction pathway. Chiral phosphonate inhibitors have been 
used in studies on the orientations of the enantiomers of a substrate in the active site. These 
structures can be used to align tetrahedral intermediates of various substrates for use in 
molecular modeling. A number of modeling studies have been performed with the aim of 
rationalizing and/or predicting enantioselectivity of triacylglycerol lipases toward substrate 
molecules. Examples of such studies include those on triacylglycerol lipases from Candida 
antarctica [Hæffner et al. 1998], Candida rugosa [Holmquist et al. 1996], Humicola 
 6
of many experimental and theoretical studies [Umeyama et al., 1973; Scheiner et al., 1975; 
Scheiner and Lipscomb, 1976; Kraut, 1977; Dewar and Storch, 1985; Warshel and Russell, 
1986]. 
Our goal with this study has been to increase the understanding of the mechanistic aspect 
of enzyme catalysis by using quantum chemical approaches to locate the minima and 
transition states involved in the reaction. Computational results for the acylation pathways 
will be presented. For the acylation step, we have also examined the effect of Asp residue and 
hydrogen bonds in the oxyanion hole on decreasing the reaction activation energy. We will 
show that the energy difference between the tetrahedral intermediate and the transition state is 
not constant; instead the smaller the activation barrier, the more stable the tetrahedral 
intermediate. In this study we have focused on the ester substrates. The double proton transfer 
mechanism for serine hydrolase catalysis has also been studied. The mechanism involves a 
proton transfer from Ser to His and a proton transfer from His to Asp at the tetrahedral 
intermediate. It is thus of interest to study this mechanism with theoretical approaches. 
 
2. Methods 
2.1 Preparation of serine hydrolase model. 
We used the crystal structure of Burkholderia Cepacia lipase in complex with 
hexylphosphonic acid (R)-2-methyl-3-phenylpropyl ester (PDB code: 1YS1) [Mezzetti et al., 
 8
Graphics, Mountain View, CA). All of the reactions were followed by using the reaction 
coordinate method [Dewar and Kirschner, 1971] with an internuclear distance or dihedral 
angle specified as the reaction coordinated. The potential energy surface for formation of 
tetrahedral intermediate was calculated by restraining two reaction coordinates. The first was 
defined as the distance between the hydroxyl oxygen of the Ser and the carbonyl carbon of the 
substrate (Ra). The second coordinate modeled abstraction of a proton from Ser oxygen to the 
His nitrogen: it was defined as the difference of the distances between the donating and the 
accepting oxygen atoms and the transferring proton (Rb). Full geometry optimization was 
accomplished at each point along the reaction path, with fixing of the distance between the 
hydroxyl oxygen of the Ser and the carbonyl carbon of the substrate at different distances. So, 
the proton transfer reaction was carried out at each of the C-O distances. The grid search 
approach was used to address both the proton-transfer step and serine's attack on the substrate 
to avoid forcing the order of the steps. In addition, in order to investigate the double proton 
transfer mechanism, the extra reaction coordinate for proton transfer from His to Asp was 
defined as Rc, which is the difference of distances between the donating and the accepting 
oxygen atoms and the transferring proton . We used Rb plus Rc to represent the double proton 
transfer simultaneously.

site-directed mutagenesis experiments to study the reaction. These partial model reactions are 
illustrated in Fig. 2. The most complete model, as has been shown in Fig. 2 (A), is the FULL 
model. The ASP model includes the Asp group without the water molecules in oxyanion hole 
(Fig. 2 (B)). The 2W model includes two water molecules in the oxyanion hole without Asp 
group (Fig. 2 (C)). The NO model has no water or Asp and thus should be the least catalyzed 
model (Fig. 2 (D)). By comparing the results for the different models, we are able to learn 
about the catalytic function of the enzyme. 
3.2 Semiempirical quantum mechanical calculations: Reaction pathway 
The first step in the serine protease pathway represents proton transfer from the Ser to the 
His and attack of the carbonyl carbon by the Ser to form the tetrahedral intermediate. Since 
there were two reaction coordinates for this first step, we used a grid approach, with attack of 
the carbonyl carbon by the Ser (Ra) occurring at fixed, but different, difference of distances 
between the donating and the accepting oxygen atoms and the transferring proton (Rb), which 
represent the proton transfer from Ser to His. This type of approach allowed us to investigate 
the energies of different possible modes of forming the tetrahedral intermediates. The 
resulting three-dimensional potential energy surface is shown in Fig. 3. The surface reveals 
two energy minima, corresponding to the Michaelis-Menten complex. It is of interest to note 
that both the potential energy surfaces in four models result in the same number of energy 
minima, and similar locations on the surface, but different energy barriers between the 
 12
were almost same as these in FULL model. However, the energy barrier in this model was 
slightly higher than that in FULL model along the lowest energy path for formation of 
tetrahedral intermediate. The result also indicates that the removal of water molecules can 
slightly decrease the stabilization to the transition state and tetrahedral intermediate. In 
contrast, the shape of energy surface in 2W model was significantly higher comparing with 
that in FULL model (Fig. 3 (C)), indicating that Asp group plays an important role in 
stabilizing the structure of transition state and tetrahedral intermediate along the reaction 
process. In NO model (Fig.3 (D)), the result suggests that, similar to 2W model, the energies 
at each grid point were greatly high due to the removal of Asp group and water molecules. 
3.3 Effects of Asp and oxyanion hole in active site. 
The energies for the stationary points involved in the reaction are summarized in Table 1. 
It clearly indicates how the residues assist the enzymatic reaction by lowering the energy 
difference between AES and ATS1. The removal of the water molecules in oxyanion hole 
raises the activation barrier by 3.6 kcal mol-1 (compared with the energies for the ASP model). 
The removal Asp raised the activation barrier by 11.1 kcal mol-1 (compared with energies for 
the 2W model). The removal both Asp and water molecules in oxyanion hole raised the 
activation barrier by 16 kcal mol-1 (compared with energies for NO model), in other words, it 
indicates the cooperation of the Asp group and oxyanion hole is capable of lowering the 
activation barrier by about 16 kcal mol-1, which is in good agreement with previous 
 14
system composed entirely of the catalytic triad (or reduced representations of the triad) 
without the surrounding protein support the concerted double proton transfer mechanism 
[Umeyama et al., 1973; Scheiner et al., 1975; Dewar and Storch, 1985]. Although this 
mechanism was generally accepted for a number of years, experiment evidence since then has 
favored a single proton transfer [Bachovchin and Roberts, 1978; Bachovchin et al., 1981; 
Kossiakoff and Spencer, 1981; Bachovchin, 1986]. A previous study using chymotrypsin 
methylated at Nε of the His, which blocks the double proton transfer, also indicated that Asp 
will remain ionized [Sholten et al., 1988]. These findings suggest, then, that the Asp will 
remain ionized in the transition state as well [Warshel and Russell, 1986], but a proton 
transfer at the transition state cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, the nature of the Asp-His 
H-bond and its role in catalysis is still debatable. Recent NMR studies have suggested that 
this H-bond is a low-barrier hydrogen bond (LBHB) [Cleland and Kreevoy, 1994; Frey and et 
al., 1994] that can partially explain serine protease catalysis, although other NMR studies 
[Ash et al., 1997] and theoretical calculations [Warshel and Papazyan, 1996; Topf et al., 2002; 
Westler et al., 2002; Schutz and Warshel, 2004] have argued against this hypothesis. 
Three-dimensional potential energy surface for double-proton-transfer is also shown in 
Fig. 4. In this model we assumed that the double proton transfer occurs simultaneously. Our 
result shows that the energy barrier is 33.6 kcal/ mol along the lowest energy path for 
formation of the tetrahedral intermediate. The energy barrier in double proton transfer is 
 16
also indicates that the cooperation of the Asp group and oxyanion hole is capable of lowering 
the activation barrier by about 16 kcal/ mol, indicating that the importance of Asp residue and 
oxyanion hole in catalytic mechanism of serine hydrolase. We also studied the double proton 
transfer mechanism. Our result showed the barrier in double proton transfer was higher than 
that in single proton transfer, indicating that the double proton transfer mechanism was 
disfavor in our calculations.
