Abstract 
This research is for the analysis, modeling and 
measurement of technical efficiency by the 
combined use of data envelopment analysis 
(DEA) and the recently developed soft 
computing approaches such as the fuzzy 
adaptive network (FAN). 
Although DEA [7, 8] is a very useful tool 
for efficiency analysis, it has several problems. 
The most important complication is the input 
and output data of the decision-making units 
(DMUs). In general, the data are not 
homogeneous. Furthermore, they are not only 
frequently fuzzy and not well defined, but also 
frequently hierarchy in nature. The purpose of 
this research is to overcome the 
above-mentioned problems by the combined use 
of DEA and FAN. 
Keywords: data envelopment analysis, neural 
networks, fuzzy sets. 
二、緣由與目的 
Although DEA [3,4]  is a very useful tool 
for efficiency analysis, it has several problems. 
The most important complication is the input 
and output data of the decision-making units 
(DMUs). In general, the data are not 
homogeneous. Furthermore, they are not only 
frequently fuzzy and not well defined, but also 
frequently hierarchy in nature. Many 
investigators have proposed various approaches 
to overcome this difficulty. However, the 
proposed approaches do not solve the basic 
problem, which is frequently in linguistic 
expression. For example, the degree of 
management competence is frequently included 
as an input. This competence can only be 
described linguistically as very competence,

generalized convexity, we introduce a class of functions called E-B-vex functions which are 
generalizations of E-convex and B-vex functions, and a class of E-B-preinvex functions which are 
generalizations of E-convex and B-preinvex functions. Some properties of these proposed classes 
are studied. 
 
 
2.  Preliminaries  
 
Let R∗  denote the set of nonnegative real numbers; Rn denote the n-dimensional Euclidean 
space; let X be a nonempty subset of Rn; λb(x, y, λ) ∈ [0, 1] for all x, y ∈ X and λ ∈ [0, 1].  
Following Bector and Singh [3], the definitions of B-vex and B-linear functions can be given 
as follows. 
 
Definition 2.1 (Ref. [3]). Let C ⊆ X be a nonempty convex set. A function f : C → R1 is said to be 
B-vex on C with respect to (w.r.t. in short) b(x, y, λ) if for all x, y ∈ C andλ ∈ [0, 1], 
 
f (λx + (1 − λ)y) ≤ λb(x, y, λ)f (x) + (1 − λb(x, y, λ))f (y). 
 
For the sake of brevity, we shall omit the argument of b unless it is needed for specification. 
    Recall [12] that, by definition, a set K ⊆ Rn  is said to be an invex set w.r.t. a given mapping 
η : Rn × Rn → Rn  if 
 
x, y ∈ K, λ ∈ [0, 1]  =⇒  y + λη(x, y) ∈ K. 
 
A set M ⊆ Rn  is said to be E-convex if there is a mapping E : Rn → Rn  such that  
 
λE(x) + (1 − λ)E(y) ∈ M,  ∀ x, y ∈ M, ∀ λ ∈ [0, 1]. 
 
In what follows, let E : Rn → Rn  and η : Rn ×Rn  → Rn  be two fixed mappings. Now, we 
state the concept of E-invex sets which are generalizations of invex and E-convex sets. 
 
Definition 2.2 (Ref. [9, Definition 2.2]). A set A ⊆ Rn is said to be E-invex w.r.t. η if 
 
x, y ∈ A,  λ ∈ [0, 1]  =⇒  E(y )+ λη(E(x),E( y)) ∈ A. 
 Let S be a nonempty subset of Rn,  E(S) is defined by E(S) = {E(x) : x א S}. 
Lemma 2.1 (Ref. [6, Proposition 2.2]). Let M ⊆  Rn  be a nonempty E-convex set, then       
E(M) ⊆ M.  
 
Lemma 2.2 (Ref. [9, Lemma 2.1]). Let A ⊆ Rn  be a nonempty E-invex set,  then E(A) ⊆ A. 
 
Finally, we describe several generalized convex functions viz, preinvex, B-preinvex, E-convex, 
and E-preinvex. 
 
 
Definition 2.3 (Ref. [12]). Let K ⊆ Rn be a nonempty invex set w.r.t. η. A function f : K →R1  is  
functions on M w.r.t. the same b. Then the function f : M → R1 defined by 
 
∑ = >= Nj jjj kxfkxf 1 0),()(  
 
is E-B-vex on M w.r.t.b. 
 
Next, we introduce a new class of functions called E-B-preinvex functions by relaxing the 
definitions of E-convex and B-preinvex functions. 
 
Definition 3.2. Let A ⊆ X  be a nonempty E-invex set. A w.r.t. η. A function  f : A →R1 is said 
to to be E-B-preinvex on A w.r.t. η, b, if for all x, y א A and λ א [0, 1], 
f (E(y) + λη(E(x), E(y))) ≤ λb(E(x), E(y), λ)f (E (x)) + (1 − λb(E(x), E(y), λ))f (E(y)). 
 
An analogous result to Theorem 3.1 for E-B-preinvex case is as follows. 
 
Theorem 3.2. Let A ⊆ X be a nonempty E-convex set w.r.t. η. Let fj, j = 1, 2, . . . , N  be 
E-B-preinvex functions on A w.r.t. the same η, b. Then the function  f  :  A → R1 defined by 
 
∑ = >= Nj jjj kxfkxf 1 0),()(  
 
is E-B-preinvex on A w.r.t.η, b. 
 
4. Main Results 
 
We first study the relations between E-B-vex and B-vex functions. 
 
Theorem 4.1. Let M ⊆ X be a nonempty E-convex set, and let C be a nonempty subset of E(M). If 
f : M → R1 is E-B-vex on M w.r.t. b, then the restriction fˆ  : C → R1 of  f : M → R1 to C defined 
by  
fˆ ( xˆ ) = f ( xˆ ) for all xˆ א C 
is a B-vex function on C w.r.t. b. 
 
Proof. Let f : M → Rn be E-B-vex on M w.r.t.b, and let C be a nonempty convex subset of 
E(M ). Then for xˆ , yˆ א C (ˆ and ˆy may not be distinct), there exist x, y א M such that xˆ = E(x)
