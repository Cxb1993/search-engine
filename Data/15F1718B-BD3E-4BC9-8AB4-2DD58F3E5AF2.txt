As the feature size of electronic devices in integrated circuit (IC) technology is 
continuously scaling down to 32 nm. Traditional Al-based interconnects have failed to 
meet requirements for deep sub-micro devices and were thus replaced by Cu, which 
has many advantages as lower resistance, better electro-migration resistance and 
lower resistance-capacitance (RC) time-delay than those of Al. Unfortunately, the fast 
diffusion of Cu enables it to react with Si, which causes the formation of the 
intermetallic compounds.
1-4
 The strong interaction between Cu and Si degrades the 
performance of interconnects. Thus, it is essential to seek suitable diffusion-barrier 
materials capable of retarding Cu penetration at ever-decreasing feature size which in 
International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductor (ITRS)

 predicted that the 
barrier thickness will be reduced eventually to 2 nm in 2016 for 27 nm technology. 
An ultrathin barrier for Cu metallization is urgently needed.  
Ta and TaN

 thin films have been widely adopted as the barrier in current IC 
production. However, most binary Ta-based barriers at the limited thickness face 
premature failures at a relatively low temperature, such as below 500 °C, because of 
their columnar structure and the formation of crystalline Ta silicides.

were thus proposed for preventing Cu penetration. Ruthenium (Ru) is potentially a 
good barrier material because it has air-stable characteristics and a negligible 
solubility in Cu at temperatures up to 900°C. In addition, the resistivity of Ru is lower 
than that of Ta (the bulk resistivity of Ru and Ta is 7.6 and 13 µΩcm, respectively). 
Ru-based barriers are promising for direct Cu electroplating without the need for an 
extra Cu seed layer. Although Ru barriers typically fail at a relatively low 
temperatures due to the formation of crystalline Ru-silicides (a Cu/Ru/Si film forms 
RuxSiy at the Ru/Si interface at 300°C for 10 min).
14 
Two major types of failure 
mechanism for barriers are incapable of retarding Cu diffusion. One is the grain 
boundary of barrier thin film, mostly arising from its columnar structure, provides the 
short passes along which Cu can diffuse through to react with underlying Si. To 
eliminate the diffusion short routes, an amorphous thin film is therefore proposed as a 
barrier because of the lack of grain boundary. Using oxygen to stuff the grain 
boundary of a barrier is also an effective approach to inhibit the diffusion path along 
the grain boundary. The other failure mechanism of a barrier is the direct reaction 
between the barrier and underlying Si at a relatively low temperature by forming 
metal silicides, thus providing the local diffusion route for Cu to penetrate through.

Characteristics of amorphous Ta-Si-C film as a diffusion barrier for copper 
metallization 
Recent studies have shown that plasma treatment can trigger phase 
transformation, improving step coverage during deposition and reducing the thin film 
resistivity.
19-22
 The properties of the film are mostly affected by plasma treatment, 
which will induce a structural change of the film. With this aspect, this study 
evaluates the Ar+H2 and Ar+N2 plasma-treated 5 nm-thick amorphous Ta-Si-C film 
as a barrier for Cu interconnection. The result indicates that Ta-Si-C diffusion barrier 
after Ar+H2 plasma treatment significantly eliminates the formation of Ta-Si-C(O)x, 
and the Ta-Si-C barrier properties can be further enhanced using Ar+N2 plasma 
treatment.

Fifteen-Nanometer Ru Diffusion Barrier on NiSi/Si for a sub-45 nm Cu Contact 
Plug 
The performance of microelectronics becomes critical when the devices are 
scaled down. In general, NiSi has been widely used as the gate and source/drain 
silicide for 45 nm technology, because of low resistivity, a line width-independent 
growth mechanism, and low Si consumption.
23
 Current studies of interfacial reactions 
between Cu and NiSi are attracting a substantial amount of interest, and recent studies 
have evaluated the effects of TiN,

 barriers in the Cu/CoSi2/Si 
stacked film, and of Ta-based barriers

 for the Cu/NiSi/Si stacked film. 
Nevertheless, research efforts on the barrier between Cu and NiSi are still rare. As a 
result, this work was aimed to evaluate Ru film as a barrier on a NiSi/Si substrate for 
the Cu contact plug. Experimental results indicated that thermal stability and barrier 
performance can be improved by use of the Ru barrier in the Cu/NiSi/Si scheme.

Low-resistivity RuTaC barriers for Cu interconnects 
To precise control over the concentration of nitrogen in ruthenium-based nitride 
barriers during reactive sputtering is substantially difficult, and the nitride film can 
easily cause nitrogen to desorb from the film when the film was annealed at a high 
temperature.
29,30
 Therefore, in this study, carbon was used instead of nitrogen without 
way to instantly heat up the device, trigger the reaction of concern at specific 
temperature and time, and then cool (quench) quickly to preserve the whole structure. 
Therefore, the properties of thin film or/and the reaction products in the devices can 
be well maintained and investigated 
For nickel silicide barrier, an Ni film 20 nm thick was deposited on the Si 
substrate by magnetron sputtering using an Ni target and a radio frequency power 
supply fixed at 150 W. The sample was then annealed at 600°C for 60 s in an Ar + H2 
(5%) ambient environment by rapid thermal annealing (RTA) to form the 
low-resistive NiSi film. Subsequently, the unreacted nickel was selectively removed 
with a solution of H2SO4:H2O2:H2O = 1:2:5. An Ru film 15 nm thick was deposited 
on the NiSi/Si substrate by magnetron sputtering from an Ru target (using a direct 
current (DC) power supply fixed at 100 W), and a 100 nm-thick Cu film was then 
deposited on top of the Ru barrier without breaking vacuum. For evaluation of barrier 
performance, the Cu/NiSi/Si and Cu/Ru/NiSi/Si stacked films were annealed at a 
temperature between 300°C and 750°C for 5 min in an Ar + H2 (5%) ambient 
atmosphere by RTA. 
For Cu electroplating, the chemicals used for the copper electrodeposition bath 
were 17.64 g/l H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), 59.9256 g/l CuSO4·5H2O(copper(II) sulfate 
hydrate), 0.0588 g/l NaCl(sodium chloride), and 0.528 g/l PEG (polyethylene glycol). 
The bath temperature and current density were maintained at room temperature and 
0.05 A/cm
2
, respectively, throughout the deposition process. 
The compositions of films were examined by a field-emission electron-probe 
micro-analyzer (FE-EPMA). which has a very large probe current (up to 500 nA) 
capable of detection ability of carbon and oxygen down to 0.5 atom %. X-ray 
diffraction (XRD) (MacScience M03XHF22, Cu Kα1)was introduced to identify the 
structure of films. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL 
JEM-2010F, acceleration voltage 200 kV) was used to observe the cross-sectional 
TEM microstructure of sandwiched films. The interdiffusion of the elements was 
detected by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), which yields a composition depth 
profile. Sheet resistance of the stacked film was measured by a four-point probe 
measurement. Surface morphologies of the films were observed by scanning electron 
microscope (SEM),

Characteristics of bonding relationship 
To investigate the chemical compounds of the studied films, XPS was employed 
to detect the possible bonding among Ta, Si and C. Figure 3 (a), (b) and (c) show the 
Ta 4f, C 1s and Si 2p spectra using XPS examination for the post-annealed films, 
respectively. Firstly, due to spin-orbit coupling, the Ta 4f spectra have the peak 
doublets with Δ = 1.9 eV, characterized as at binding energy of 21.9 eV and 23.8 eV 
for metallic Ta 4f. The Ta 4f spectra of a film with DPR 0 in Fig. 3(a) show an

copper metallization 
 
TABLE II. Composition of TaSiC films obtained at different deposition power ratio 
(DPR) between C and TaSi2targets, as analyzed by FE-EPMA. 
 
Table II lists the composition of studied TaSiC films, which was analyzed by 
FE-EPMA. Very small amounts of oxygen (0.8–1.6 at. %) were detected on 
as-deposited TaSi2 film and TaSiC films (DPR 1 and DPR2), indicating that the film 
might be contaminated from sputtering chamber and/or air environment, where 
oxygen contamination was hard to avoid, especially for Ta which shows very strong 
tendency to capture residual oxygen. The carbon content of the film increases 
monotonically with increasing sputtering power of the carbon target. This implies that 
carbon content of the film can be easily controlled by this way. During film formation, 
carbon atom competes with Si atom to become amorphous Ta–(Si, C) phase. Thus, 
the composition of the film sputtered at DPR 1 (24 at.% C) becomes Ta39Si36C24, 
which is close to the formula Ta2(Si0.6C0.4)3 yet in amorphous state. While the film 
sputtered at DPR 2 (34 at. % C) has a composition of Ta33Si32C34, which is close to 
the formula Ta(Si0.5C0.5)2 yet amorphous. For simplicity, we still use the symbol 
TaSiC to denote both of them in the following text, unless specified. 
 
Figure 6 plots the variation in sheet resistance of the postannealed Si/TaSiC/Cu 
films after RTA at a temperature between 300 and 800 °C for 1 min. A manifest rise 
in sheet resistance implies the reaction or intermixing at interfaces of the sandwiched 
films, associated with the formation of intermetallic compounds, such as Cu3Si. Sheet 
resistance of the sandwiched film with TaSi2 not added with carbon is raised when the 
film is annealed at 400 °C and higher. With the introduction of high concentration 
carbon into the barrier layer, the resulting sandwiched films exhibit excellent blocking 
ability to retard Cu diffusion to a temperature of at least 700 °C for the Ta39Si36C24 
layer, and 750 °C for the Ta33Si32C34 layer, respectively, as depicted in Fig. 6.

while (d)is the enlarged circled regime of (c). 
 
Figure 8 shows XTEM micrographs of Ta39Si36C24 layer in the sandwiched 
film, at (a) as-deposited state, and that annealed at (b) 700 °C and [(c) and (d)] 750 °C 
for 1 min, respectively. Although the Ta39Si36C24 film thickness was controlled to a 
fixed value of 5 nm, the observed film in Fig. 8(a), in fact, composes of TaSiC and a 
TaSiCOx on top of it, together with a native silicon oxide underneath. The measured 
total thickness of Ta39Si36C24 and TaSiCOx is around 5.8 nm, close to the 
experimental setting. The slight increase in thickness may arise from inclined cross 
sectioning or oxidation of TaSiC during sputtering. The formation of TaSiCOx layer at 
the interface of Ta39Si36C24 /Cu, at the expense of Ta39Si36C24 thickness, is due to the 
fact that Ta has a very strong tendency to react with residual oxygen which exists in 
the deposition/annealing chamber. Similar behavior was identified earlier in between 
the interface of Si/TaC/Cu stacked films that an amorphous TaCOx layer forms.
39
 Our 
observation is similar to such an earlier observation. The amorphous TaSiCOx 
together with Ta39Si36C24, and probably with the native SiO2 layer, must have 
provided superior barrier properties in retarding Cu diffusion into Si. Highly stable 
amorphous Ta39Si36C24 layers are more effective in preventing Cu penetration than do 
their crystalline counterpartsn which provide grain boundaries, structural defects of 
short paths to Cu passing.

Figure 8(b) shows that after annealing at 700 °C for 1 
min, both the Ta39Si36C24 and TaSiCOx layers become a little thicker (~10 nm) and

Figure 12 depicts scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs taken from 
the surface (copper side) of the sandwiched Ta34Si47C18 film that had been annealed at 
(a) 750°C and (b) 800°C. As seen in Fig. 12a, there are tiny voids (0.3–1.8 µm in size) 
and tiny white particles (0.1–0.7µ m) on the surface of the sandwiched Ta34Si47C18 
film annealed at 750°C. Copper has a much higher coefficient of thermal expansion 
than does refractory Ta–Si–C. Upon heating and cooling, the larger expansion and 
contraction of copper will bestow a huge interfacial stress, which destroys the 
integrity of the copper film. Microvoids form to release the interfacial stress. The tiny 
white particles randomly distributed on the surface are identified to be Cu3Si 
precipitates as a result of reaction between Cu and Si, corresponding to the Cu3Si 
diffraction peaks in the 750°C XRD of Fig. 9a. When the film was annealed at 800°C, 
the voids became larger (0.8–3.6 µm) due to the slightly higher interfacial stress. 
White Cu3Si particles grow bigger (0.2–2 µm)and become rectangular in shape for 
those with a size around 2 µm, as shown in Fig. 4b.

The failure of a thin barrier layer is commonly associated with easier diffusion 
through short passes like grain boundaries or localized defects. Cu penetrates through 
2 substrate, 
forming intermetallic phase (Cu3Si), which is the usual way to break the barrier layer 
and limit oxidization resistance.
42
 A barrier layer with an amorphous structure has 
great potential for preventing Cu diffusion due to the lack of grain boundaries. 
Figure 14 shows XRD patterns of the studied 100 nm thick Ta– Si–C film 
annealed at elevated temperatures for 30 min. The as-deposited Ta–Si–C films are 
amorphous. These thin films show the first sign of nano-crystallization of TaSi2 phase 
at 700 and 900°C for Ta34Si47C18 and Ta26Si41C32, respectively. The grain size of such 
TaSi2 is extremely small, as manifest from the broadened diffraction peaks. The full 
width at half maximum was used to estimate the grain size by the Scherrer equation in 
crystalline film. The peaks indexed in Fig. 14a all belong to the TaSi2 phase with 
grain sizes of 4.8 nm when Ta34Si47C18 was annealed at 900°C. Additionally, there are 
broad peaks visible in the XRD spectra of Ta30Si44C25 and Ta26Si41C32 samples (Fig. 
14b and c), which can be identified to arise from very small grains of approximately 
1.8–1.9 nm. 
Because of the stronger bonding between Ta and Si to form TaSi2 compound in 
ternary Ta–Si–C systems, local diffusion of Si from certain regions within the 
amorphous matrix occurs, which then leads to the crystallization of amorphous 
Ta–Si–C structure. This diffusion-like behavior is a self-limiting process and is 
stopped upon nucleation of TaSi2 during annealing at an elevated temperature. Thus, 
introduction of Si and C into Ta barriers in this study markedly inhibits the reaction 
between the barrier and underlying Si substrate, because the difficulty in nucleation of 
TaSi2 within the amorphous Ta–Si–C prevents failure from the reaction between the 
layers at a relatively low temperature. 
 
Figure 15. (Color online) Room-temperature resistivity of the sandwich structure 
–Si–C (18, 25, and 32 atom % C in the Ta–Si–C layer) after annealing at 
temperatures up to 900°C. 
 
Two-step failure sequences can be observed between the Cu overlayer and the 
Si substrate through the barrier layer. The first step is the nucleation and 
crystallization of TaSi2 within the amorphous Ta–Si–C matrix due to the ultrathin 
nature of the Ta–Si–C barrier. This provides a grain boundary perpendicular to the 
film upon elevated temperature annealing. The second step is penetration of the Cu 
atom through the grain boundaries or localized defects of the barrier layer to react 
with the underlying Si substrate until the barrier fails. Thus, the intermixing between 
Si/ –Si–C can be prevented if the thermal stability of the Ta–Si–C layer is high 
/TaC system.
39
 The 
amorphous Ta–Si–C barrier thus provides superior barrier performance in preventing 
Cu diffusion. Barrier disintegration can be considered a major factor for the failure of 
 Figure 16 Resistivity of the Ta-Si-C film annealed at a temperature between 300 and 
900°C for 30 min. 
 
Figure 17 shows the XRD results of the Ta-Si-C film with and without plasma 
treatment. In Fig. 17(a), the as-deposited Ta-Si-C film without plasma treatment is 
amorphous; however, TaSi2 diffractions appear when the film was annealed at 750°C. 
The TaSi2 diffraction peaks are broadened, indicating that the grain size of the film is 
extremely small. The as-deposited Ta-Si-C film after Ar+H2 plasma treatment is also 
amorphous, as shown in Fig. 17(b), and broaden TaSi2 diffractions can be also found 
at 750°C. As seen in Fig. 17(c), the as-deposition Ta-Si-C film is amorphous after 
Ar+N2 plasma treatment, but the formation of nanocrystalline TaSi2 is observed at 
800°C. Using Ar+N2 plasma treatment on the film clearly stabilizes the amorphous 
structure, and incorporation of nitrogen is clearly found to enhance the thermal 
stability of film. Nitrogen plasma-treated tungsten film has been also found that the 
film became dense after the surface nitridation, and nitrogen atoms would stuff the 
grain boundary of the film
46,47
. In this study, we haven’t found TaN diffraction peaks 
from the XRD analysis. This fact depicts nitridation only occurs on the surface, so the 
resistivity of the film remains low after N2 plasma treatment. 
TaSiC(O)x layer, 2-3 nm in thickness, on Ta-Si-C film is observed, as shown in Fig. 
18(a). The oxygen concentration is 3.2 at.% after being analyzed by EDS. Diffraction 
pattern, inset in Fig. 18(a) shows only a broaden diffraction ring is obtained along 
with bright diffraction spots from Si substrate. Figure 18(b) shows the thickness of 
Ar+H2 plasma-treated Ta-Si-C film is 158 nm, and no was found on the surface. 
Diffraction pattern, inset in Fig. 18(b), shows the film is amorphous. The thickness of 
Ar+N2 plasma-treated Ta-Si-C film is about 156 nm, and a 2 nm-thick TaSiC(O)xN 
was observed on the surface, as shown in Fig. 18(c). The concentration of oxygen and 
nitrogen is 1.18 and 6.62 at.%, respectively, after being analyzed by EDS. The results 
clearly show that Ta-Si-C film has formed a nitride layer on the surface after Ar+N2 
plasma treatment.

structure after annealing at 700°C and at 750°C are shown in Fig. 21(a) and Fig. 21(b), 
respectively. The surface of Cu/Ta-Si-C (5 nm)/Si structure remained smooth after 
annealing at 700°C, as shown in Fig. 21(a). However, after annealing at 750°C, many 
microvoids and Cu3Si grain were found on the surface of Cu/Ta-Si-C (5 nm)/Si. 
Using Ar+N2 plasma treatment, on the other hand, the surface morphology of the 
750°C-annealed Cu/Ta-Si-C (5 nm)/Si structure have a smooth surface, as shown in 
Fig. 22(a). Many microvoids and Cu3Si nucleates were found when the film was 
annealed at 800°C, as shown in Fig. 22(b). The formation of Cu3Si phase on the film 
surface indicates that the Ta-Si-C barrier has failed to prevent the penetration of Cu 
atoms; thus the Cu atoms reacted with underlying Si to form Cu3Si phase.

Resistivity and Structural Changes of the Films 
 
Fig. 25. Sheet resistance changes in the stacked film. 
 
Figure 25 shows changes in the sheet resistance of the Cu/NiSi/Si (curve a) and 
Cu/Ru/NiSi/Si (curve b) stacked films after RTA at a temperature between 300°C and 
750°C for 5 min. The change in sheet resistance may reflect reaction or intermixing at 
diffraction peak of the film becomes stronger after annealing at 700–750°C, implying 
that Cu has diffused considerably through the Ru layer to react with the underlying 
NiSi and/or the Si substrate, and the Cu diffraction peak disappears eventually at 
750°C (NiSi2 is known to form at approximately 700°C). However, no NiSi2 
diffraction peak can be identified after annealing at up to 700°C in our study, 
suggesting that the Ru-capped NiSi/Si has an inhibitive effect on the transformation 
from NiSi to NiSi2. This was also found for the Ti-capped Ni/Si thin film.
50
 The Cu 
diffraction peaks disappear completely, and the Ru2Si3
51
 diffraction peaks (JCPDS 
71-0455) are detected at 750°C. This finding reveals that Ru has reacted with NiSi 
and/or the Si substrate by forming an Ru2Si3 phase, and Cu has penetrated through the 
barrier to react with the underlying NiSi and/or the Si substrate to form Cu3Si. The 
appearances of Ru2Si3 and Cu3Si strongly correlate with the abrupt increase in the 
sheet resistance of the film, as shown in Fig. 25 (curve b). The intensity of CuNi is 
also high at 700°C for the Cu/NiSi/Si stacked film, as observed from comparison with 
the Cu/Ru/NiSi/Si, revealing that the formation of CuNi has depleted the Ni content in 
the underlying NiSi in the case without the Ru barrier; however, this is undesirable for 
the use of NiSi on gates and source/ drains to reduce contact resistance. Interposing 
the Ru layer between Cu and the NiSi/Si can thus prevent early dissociation of the 
NiSi and formation of the CuNi.

films after annealing at elevated temperatures (arb. arbitrary).

Figure 29 presents the AES depth profiles of the Cu/NiSi/Si and Cu/Ru/NiSi/Si 
stacked films annealed at 600°C. For the Cu/NiSi/Si stacked film, as shown in Fig. 
29a, Cu still dominates on the surface; however, a noticeable amount of Ni can be 
detected in the Cu layer, implying that the underlying NiSi has decomposed to 
provide Ni to mix with Cu to form CuNi. Additionally, the interface of the NiSi layer 
is unapparent, and the Cu-Si intermixing is also observed at the interface of Cu and 
NiSi/Si. Figure 29b shows that Cu dominates on the Cu/Ru/NiSi/Si film surface 
except at the initial measuring points, which reflects surface contamination. The 
surface of the film was contaminated by carbon, and it reflects the high Ru content on 
the surface because the Auger electron energy of C is close to that of Ru. Cu has not 
noticeably diffused into the underlying NiSi upon annealing at 600°C, revealing that 
the Cu/Ru/NiSi/ Si stacked film retained intact. 
through the Ru layer to form CuNi, but no CuNi peak is observed in the XRD result, 
implying that NiSi oxide is more probable in this study. However, the interfaces 
between Cu/Ru and NiSi/Si are intact, suggesting that neither Cu3Si nor CuNi 
intermetallic compounds form. Interposition of a ruthenium film is observed from a 
comparison with the Cu/NiSi/Si stacked film (Fig. 30a), which has a better barrier 
effect at the stacked film. The results closely correlate with the finding from the XRD 
examination and the sheet resistance variation. However, the thermal stability of the 
Ru barrier is limited in retardation of Cu diffusion, since the failure temperature of 
Cu/Ru/NiSi/Si exceeds that of Cu/NiSi/Si by 50°C. Recently, researchers have 
studied the barrier effect of Ru nitride and/or Ru-TaN on Si substrates with the goal of 
meeting the requirement of the International Technology Roadmap for 
Semiconductors (ITRS).
53-55
 Nevertheless, resistivity of the Ru nitride barrier needs 
improvement, and the effect on NiSi/Si requires further evaluation.

were then annealed at temperatures between 300 and 700°C for 30 min to assess the 
applicability of Ru- TaC in Cu interconnects. The sheet resistance of the stacked films 
gradually decreased when the films were annealed at temperatures up to 500°C, as 
shown in Fig. 32. This decreasing trend in the film sheet resistance implies that the 
films are stable and free from the formation of intermetallic compounds because the 
barrier blocks the intermixing between Cu and Si. In the studied films, the sheet 
resistances of the Cu/Ru77Ta15C7/Si and Cu/Ru/TaC/Si stacked films only slightly 
increased at 700°C, as shown in Fig. 32. This indicates that Ru77Ta15C7 and Ru/TaC 
exhibit superior barrier performances in terms of preventing material intermixing 
between the layers. However, for the Cu/Ru82Ta12C5/Si, Cu/Ru68Ta21C10/Si and 
Cu/Ru52Ta32C15/Si stacked films, the associated sheet resistances began to increase at 
650°C and then abruptly increased at 700°C; hence, the barrier effects of Ru82Ta12C5, 
Ru68Ta21C10 and Ru52Ta32C15 are inferior to those of Ru77Ta15C7 and Ru/TaC. The 
penetration of Cu atoms across the barrier depends on the grain size and shape of 
grain boundaries in the barrier. The structure of Ru77Ta15C7 is comparatively difficult 
for copper atoms to diffuse along the grain boundaries, which results in the film with 
superior barrier properties.
57
 For Ru/TaC multilayers, the structure extends the 
diffusion path along the grain boundary. Therefore, Cu diffusion at the grain boundary 
appears to be more difficult and can delay the failure of the barrier. The failure 
temperature of the Ru- TaC barrier in this study is much higher than that of Ru or TaC 
alone, revealing that the Ru-TaC barrier is more effective in blocking Cu diffusion.

Cu/Ru77Ta15C7/Si stacked film annealed at 650°C, and (d) the Cu/Ru/TaC/Si stacked 
film annealed at 650°C. 
Figure 34 displays a cross-sectional TEM image of the 600°C-annealed 
Cu/Ru82Ta12C5/Si (Fig. 34a), as-deposited Cu/Ru77Ta15C7/Si (Fig. 34b), 
650°C-annealed Cu/Ru77Ta15C7/Si (Fig. 34c), and 650°C-annealed Cu/Ru/TaC/Si (Fig. 
34d) films. The interface between Cu and Ru82Ta12C5 is unclear, and Cu atoms can be 
observed to have slightly penetrated through the barrier, as shown in Fig. 34a. The 
lightly contrasted layer above Si is native oxide, which can also be observed in the 
other investigated schemes. The formation of native oxide is due to the fact that RCA 
cleaned Si substrate has immediately reacted with residual oxygen in the deposition 
chamber before depositing the film, and the studied Ru-TaC barrier together probably 
with the native oxide must have provided superior barrier properties in retarding Cu 
diffusion into Si. For the Cu/Ru77Ta15C7/Si stacked film, the interfaces were clean and 
sharp in the as-deposited state (Fig. 34b); and the Ru77Ta15C7 barrier retained its 
integrity when the film was annealed at 650°C (Fig. 34c). It can be observed that the 
Ru77Ta15C7 film crystallized into small grains after being annealed at 650°C. The 
Cu/Ru/TaC/Si stacked film exhibited a sharp interface when the film was annealed at 
650°C, as shown in Fig. 34d. The interface between the layers remained clear in the 
TEM image, as there were no observable interfacial interactions between the Ru/TaC 
layer and Si. However, the cross-sectional TEM image exhibits several tiny inverted 
pyramidal Cu3Si structures that were nucleated by the {111} close-packed planes at 
the Ru-TaC/Si interface, wherein the barrier maintained a flat appearance with good 
integrity. This indicates that Cu atoms may have slightly penetrated through the 
barrier along the grain boundaries to form Cu3Si at a specific temperature. As the 
Cu3Si phase gradually grew larger, it eventually induced interface delamination at the 
failure temperature. This can be attributed to the formation of crystalline Ru/TaC 
grains near 650°C and the provision of diffusion paths for Cu atoms by the grain 
boundaries. 
 
 
inconsistency might be attributed to the uniformity of the sample. Furthermore, 
determine sheet resistance mainly yields the state of the Cu overlayer, since this 
overlayer carriers almost all of the probe currents due to the resistivity of the barrier 
substantially exceeds that of Cu. Hence, the interaction between the layers may not be 
immediately detected via sheet resistance measurement. The TEM image (Fig. 34d) 
exhibited clear interfaces between the films when Cu/Ru/TaC/Si film was annealed at 
650°C, which is corresponded to the region examined by TEM is very local. However, 
the barrier effect of Ru/TaC bilayer is apparently better than that of Ru82Ta12C5. The 
formation of microvoids is due to the fact that copper has a much higher coefficient of 
thermal expansion than the refractory Ru-TaC. Upon heating and cooling, the larger 
expansion and contraction of copper will induce a huge interfacial stress, which 
destroys the integrity of the copper film. Therefore, microvoids form to release the 
Interfacial stress. 
Figure 36 depicts the AES depth profiles of the 600°C-annealed Cu/Ru82Ta12C5/Si 
(Fig. 36a), 650°C-annealed Cu/Ru77Ta15C7/Si (Fig. 36b), and 600°C-annealed 
Cu/Ru/TaC/Si (Fig. 36c) stacked films. Although AES has its limitation on examine 
diffusion, it is still very helpful in detecting elemental distribution in depth profile if 
the element concentration is not too low. The Cu content dominates the film surfaces 
except at the initial measuring points, which reflects surface contamination. The depth 
profiles of the elemental distribution for the 600°C-annealed Cu/Ru82Ta12C5/Si film 
are sharp at the interfaces, as shown in Fig. 36a. The interface of the barrier layer was 
still well defined although the Cu concentration was slightly higher at the 
Ru82Ta12C5/Si interface. In addition, the oxygen content increases within the 
sandwiched Ru82Ta12C5 film, which reflects the fact that Ta has a strong affinity for 
oxygen during annealing or deposition. This study used Ar + H2 (5%) as annealing 
ambient, so the oxygen content in the Cu film is very low. However, the oxygen 
content is higher within the sandwiched Ru82Ta12C5, reflecting that the fact that Ta is 
a strong oxygen getter during annealing and/or depositing. The plateau of the Cu 
profile on the surface remained high, indicating that the Ru82Ta12C5 layer was still 
capable of preventing intermixing at 600°C. For the 650°C-annealed Cu/ 
Ru77Ta15C7/Si stacked film, however, a higher in the Cu, Ru, Ta, and C contents 
within Ru77Ta15C7 barrier were observed, as shown in Fig.36b. Cu did not noticeably 
diffuse into the Ru Ru77Ta15C7 layer upon annealing at 650°C, suggesting that the 
sandwiched Ru77Ta15C7 film retained its integrity and the intermixing of layers in the 
Ru77Ta15C7 sandwiched film was prevented. This finding implies that Ru77Ta15C7 is 
effective in preventing Cu penetration. Figure 36c displays the AES depth profiles of 
the Cu/Ru/TaC/Si structure. According to Fig. 36c, Cu did not noticeably diffuse into 
the Ru/TaC layer upon annealing at 650°C for 30 min. Cu was found only on the top 
surface of the film, while a drop was found in toward the interface between Cu and 
Ru. However, a slight higher Cu content was detected at the interface between 
film at an elevated temperature, and Ru52Ta32C15/Si and Ru68Ta21C10/Si have only 
Ru(C) (101) preferential diffraction. The structure of the Ru82Ta12C5 and Ru77Ta15C7 
revealed a slightly difference after the films being annealed.
57 
The Ru Ru77Ta15C7 and 
Ru Ru82Ta12C5 film have a mixed Ru(C)(002) and Ru(C)(101)-oriented crystalline 
when the film was annealed at an elevated temperature. The mixed (002) and (101) 
crystalline apparently provide a complicated path for copper atoms diffusion, while 
(002)-orientated Ru(C) is higher for Ru77Ta15C7. The copper atoms penetrate along 
grain boundary of the preferentially (002)-orientated Ru(C) texture appears more 
difficult; thus, Ru Ru77Ta15C7 exhibits a superior barrier property. 
This study shows that the 10-nm-thick Ru77Ta15C7 exhibit the best barrier 
performance and have a failure temperature at least 650°C for 30 min, although a 
barrier with the thickness of 10 nm is slightly too thick for the use in a sub-32 nm 
technology node; and the thermal budget is applicable to practical semiconductor 
manufacturing process. In our results on the 5- nm-thick Ru77Ta15C7 barrier and the 
5-nm-thick Ta34Si47C18 barrier, the failure temperature will be at least of 750°C for 1 
min.
57,58
 The barrier performance for Ta34Si47C18 mostly from its amorphous nature, 
and the amorphous Ta34Si47C18 is thermally stable up to 800°C for 30 min, which is 
mainly due to carbon incorporation. As-deposited Ru77Ta15C7 film has a crystalline 
Ru4Ta phase, and will be an effective barrier because the nonpreferred crystallinity of 
Ru(C)(002) and Ru(C)(101) in the annealed film act as an effective barrier to block 
Cu diffusion. Although the Ta34Si47C18 also has a superior performance, the resistivity 
of as-deposited Ta34Si47C18 is 349 μΩcm, and that of the 900°C-annealed film is 210 
μΩcm.59 On the other hand, the resistivity of as-deposited Ru77Ta15C7 in this study is 
143 μΩcm, and that of the 900°C-annealed film is as low as 20 μΩcm. The low 
resistivity of Ru77Ta15C7 makes it potentially to be used for direct copper 
electroplating without the need for an extra copper seed layer. Laurila et al. showed 
that the resistivity of Ta53C47 is 210 μΩcm, and the 7-nm-thick TaC fails at 550°C for 
30min.
60 
For the ternary ruthenium nitride, the 15-nm-thick Ru-Ta-N on SiO2/Si 
substrate fails at 900°C for 30 min; however, no related resistivity result has been 
shown. For the 10-nm-thick Ru-TiN barrier, the film has a low resistivity of 190 
μΩcm and has a failure temperature of 725°C for 30 min when the film was deposited 
on SiO2/Si substrate.
61 
From the results shown above, the Ru77Ta15C7 film in this 
study is applicable as a barrier and is capable of direct Cu electroplating because of 
the low resistivity and its crystallinity. 
 
Ultrathin Ru–Ta–C Barriers for Cu Metallization 
The composition of the films was Ru82Ta12C5, Ru77Ta15C7, Ru68Ta21C10, 
Ru52Ta32C15, and Ta65C35 when the sputtering power of Ru was 100, 75, 50, 25, and 0 
W, respectively, at a fixed TaC sputtering power of 100 W. The results indicate that 
the composition of the studied films can be easily adjusted by controlling the 
for direct Cu electroplating without a Cu seed layer; the ability to directly electroplate 
Cu is essential because of the continuous scaling down of device dimensions. When 
the TaC content increased further, the diffraction intensities decreased for the 
Ru68Ta21C10 and eventually disappeared for the Ru52Ta32C15.

amorphous-like Ru52Ta32C15Si is thermally stable at 600°C. The diffraction peaks of 
the 800°C-annealed Ru52Ta32C15Si correspond to Ta2O5 and Ru(C), indicating that the 
Ru–Ta–C films at 800°C have the same structure as the Ta2O5 and Ru(C) phases. 
However, the annealed, Ru-rich Ru82Ta12C5Si and Ru77Ta15C7Si films showed high 
intensity Ru(C)(002) and Ru(C)(101) diffraction peaks, while the annealed 
Ru68Ta21C10 Si and Ru52Ta32C15 tensity Ru(C)(101) 
diffraction peak. The nonpreferred crystallinity of Ru(C)(002) and Ru(C)(101) in a 
Ru–Ta–C film might act as an effective barrier to block Cu diffusion.

 One very important phenomenon to be noted in Fig. 39 and 40 is that ruthenium 
silicide and tantalum silicide are not found in the annealed films. It is also interesting 
that the as-deposited Ru–Ta–C film had a high Ru4Ta(002) diffraction, which is 
probably due to the film being stressed during sputtering, while the film changed 
into(101)-oriented Ru(C) after annealing at an elevated temperature because of the 
relaxation of stress. 
RuN has been reported to decompose into Ru at 275°C because of the effusion 
of nitrogen that results in the crystallization of Ru. In turn, this phenomenon implies 
that RuN is unstable.
66 
Our results show no significant changes in the structure after 
annealing the Ru–Ta–C film up to 700°C. No observation of carbon diffraction 
reveals that carbon does not form a carbon cluster in the matrix or its concentration is 
too small to be detected by XRD. The Ru peak shift after annealing at 800°C indicates 
the carbon atom has been incorporated into the Ru lattice to form Ru(C). One may 
expect that Ru might oxidize at high temperatures. Because Ta has a much higher 
oxidation tendency than Ru and no RuOx diffraction peak has been detected, the 
incorporation of carbon is presumably responsible for the Ru peak shift. Although 
adding carbon can enhance the thermal stability of the film, carbon (as a form of 
graphite) can inevitably be oxidized into gaseous CO at an elevated temperature, 
which is indicated in the reaction shown above. In addition, the fact that no ruthenium 
silicide or tantalum silicide appears at any temperature up to 900°C further confirms 
the stability of the Ru–Ta–C film. According to the Ru–C phase diagram, the 
solubility of C in Ru is extremely low, and no RuC compound has been observed 
below 1200°C. Although very little is known about the Ru–C phase diagram at low 
temperatures, Panchakarla et al.
67
 recently reported that carbon would precipitate in 
the form of graphite, so RuC is unstable with decreasing temperature. The solubility 
of carbon in Ru is ~0.04 wt % at room temperature. It can therefore be assumed that 
Ru(C) will slightly decompose into Ru(C) and CO at an elevated temperature, but the 
reaction between Ru–Ta and Si will occur before Ru(C) fully decomposes. 
 
Structural evolution of annealed Cu Ru–Ta–C Si stacked films.— 10-nm-thick 
Ru, TaC, and Ru–Ta–C barriers have been thoroughly evaluated at a temperature 
between 300 and 700°C for 30 min, and it was found that Ru82Ta12C5 and Ru77Ta15C7 
are more effective as barriers (not shown in this study). The failure temperature of 
Ru82Ta12C5, Ru77Ta15C7, Ru66Ta21C10, and Ru52Ta32C15 is at 650, 700, 600, and 600°C, 
respectively; therefore, the Ru82Ta12C5 and Ru77Ta15C7 have been chosen to present 
the most effective barrier performance when shrinking the thickness of the barrier. To 
assess the applicability of the Ru–Ta–C films on Cu interconnection, 5-nm-thick 
Ru–Ta–C films were stacked between Cu and a Si wafer and annealed at a 
temperature between 300 and 850°C, as shown in Fig. 41. The electrical resistivity of 
 Figure 42. Schematic drawing of the grain boundaries between the adjacent grains for 
(a) (002) preferred orientation, (b) (101) preferred orientation, (c) mixed (002) and 
(101) orientation with higher (002) texture, and (d) mixed (002) and (101) orientation 
with higher (101) texture. 
The diffusion of Cu atoms through the barrier depends on the grain size and the 
grain boundary shape. Tantalum nitride (002) preferred orientation has a better 
structural stability to prevent copper diffusion than that of the (101) orientation.
68
 
Ru(C)(002) in this study has a close-packed atomic arrangement and has narrower 
grain boundaries between adjacent grains (Fig. 42a); however, Ru(C)(101) is much 
more loosely packed and has wider, straight grain boundaries (Fig. 42b). A 
preferentially (002)-oriented Ru(C) has a better barrier effect than that of 
(101)-orientated Ru(C) because (002) texture has less defective grain boundaries, 
which extend the diffusion path along the grain boundary. Therefore, Cu diffusion at 
the grain boundary appears to be very difficult and can delay the failure of the barrier. 
Ru77Ta15C7 in this study has a mixed (002) and (101)-oriented crystalline, while 
Ru(C)(002) diffraction is higher. The schematic of atomic arrangement for 
Ru77Ta15C7 is shown in Fig. 42c. The copper atoms that diffuse along the grain 
boundaries are comparatively difficult, so the film has superior barrier properties 
among the studied films. Ru82Ta12C5, on the other hand, has a higher (101) diffraction; 
the schematic is shown in Fig. 42d, indicating that the film to prevent Cu from 
The amorphous Ru–Ta–C barrier, which lacks grain boundaries, might exhibit 
better barrier properties. In this study, however, the Ru52Ta32C15 barrier (not shown 
here) had inferior barrier properties to those of Ru77Ta15C7. The reason for this is that 
amorphous-like Ru52Ta32C12 only remains stable at temperature of 600°C and below 
(Fig. 39d), and the structure becomes (101) preferred orientation at higher 
temperatures. Thermally induced crystallization of Ru52Ta32C15 will mediate Cu 
diffusion along grain boundaries between the adjacent grains, resulting in barrier 
failure. Furthermore, XRD results (Fig. 39) show that Ru77Ta15C7
Ru82Ta12C5/ –Ta–C film at an 
elevated temperature. However, the Ru52Ta32C15 /Si and Ru68Ta21C10 /Si have 
Ru(101) preferential diffraction. The mixed Ru(002) and Ru)101( orientations 
obviously provide a complicated path for Cu diffusion; thus, Ru77Ta32C12 exhibits a 
superior barrier property. Care must be taken in drawing conclusions from the fact 
that the structural changes of the 30-min-annealed Ru–Ta–C film may be different 
from that of the 1-min-annealed Ru–Ta–C barrier. 
The annealing time in evaluating the equilibrium phase formation should be 
sufficiently long to complete the phase transition. However, to elucidate the barrier 
performance, short time annealing would be adequate in reflecting the practical 
semiconductor manufacturing process. One may expect that annealing longer would 
reduce the failure temperature of the barrier, and depositing Cu film onto Ru–Ta–C 
barrier could possibly affect the structural change of the Ru–Ta–C barriers. 
Nevertheless, the structure of 5-nm-thick Ru– Ta–C barrier in this study is too thin to 
be detected by XRD. It is worth further studying the structural correlation between 
Ru–Ta– / /Ru–Ta–C/  
A study of the direct electroplating of Cu on a Ru–Ta–C barrier without a Cu 
seed layer was also performed. It is well known that the electrical resistivity of the 
substrate affects the subsequent Cu electroplating, so low resistivity Ru–Ta–C films 
might be useful as barriers and/or seed layers for Cu electroplating. The preliminary 
results showed that a Cu film could be successfully electrodeposited on a 5-nm-thick 
Ru–Ta–C film with a Ru content higher than 68 atom %, as shown in Table IV. 
Structural analysis using XRD, as shown in Fig. 39, has also demonstrated that the 
Ru–Ta–C film has a (002) preferred orientation when introducing TaC into Ru. The 
orientation and low electrical resistivity of the Ru–Ta–C film are beneficial for 
electroplating Cu. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to form CuNi before it fails. After that, Cu reacts with the NiSi/Si to form Cu3Si. 
Introduction of the Ru barrier can prevent intermixing between Cu and the NiSi/Si, 
and hence it can improve the thermal stability of the stacked film, which can be used 
as a diffusion barrier for seedless Cu contact plugs on the NiSi/Si substrate. 
Low resistivity Ru–Ta–C films were prepared by magnetron DC sputtering 
method and the barrier effect on Cu interconnection has been evaluated in this study. 
The crystalline structure and the resistivity of a Ru–Ta–C film can be easily 
controlled by careful adjustment of the deposition power of the Ru and TaC targets. 
Ru77Ta15C7 and Ru/TaC exhibit the best barrier performance and have a failure 
temperature at least 650°C for 30 min. Because of the low resistivity and high failure 
temperature of the films. the electrical resistivity of the Ru–Ta–C film decreases with 
increasing Ru content and reaches the lowest resistivity of 92 μΩcm for the 
Ru82Ta12C5. Optimizing the composition of the film can yield a nearly amorphous 
structure for the as-deposited Ru52Ta32C15 thin film. Ru–Ta–C films crystallized into 
Ta2O5 and Ru(C) at an elevated temperature could provide an additional barrier to 
prevent Cu diffusion. The 5-nm-thick Ru77Ta15C7 exhibited the best barrier 
performance and had a failure temperature of at least 750°C. Because of the low 
resistivity and high failure temperature of the films, ultrathin Ru–Ta–C films are 
promising as barriers for Cu metallization.

with D.I. water. After cleaning, the substrates were immersed in a SnCl2．2H2O sensitization solution for 10 
min and then rinsed with D.I. water. The substrates were then immersed in a PdCl2 activation solution for 10 
min before deposition. The reaction mixture was prepared by mixing 0.250 M Zn(NO3)2, 0.300 M 
(CH3)2NHBH3 (dimethylamine borane, DMAB), and 0 to 0.0725 M MnNO3. The substrates were immersed in 
the reaction mixture at 70oC for 120 min to deposit the Mn-doped ZnO thin films. After deposition, the 
substrates were rinsed with D.I. water and then dried in a drying oven. The films were then annealed at a 
temperature between 400oC and 600oC for 30 min in an Ar+H2(5%) atmosphere by a rapid thermal annealer 
(RTA). 
The thicknesses of the films were measured by a profilometer, and the compositions of the films were 
examined by an electron probe x-ray microanalyzer (EPMA). The crystalline structures of the films were 
characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu Kαl radiation. The surface morphologies of the films were 
studied using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). The optical transmittances of the films 
were recorded by an ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared (UV-Vis-IR) spectrophotometer. The resistivities (ρ), 
carrier concentrations (n), and mobilities (μ) were measured using a Hall effect measurement system. The 
magnetic properties of the films were measured by a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The compositions of the as-deposited films were analyzed using an EPMA, which indicated that the 
films contained 4.0 at.%, 6.1 at.%, and 7.1 at.% manganese when the films were deposited in solutions 
consisting of 0.0425 M, 0.0525 M, and 0.0725 M MnNO3, respectively, as shown in Table 1. The films were 
slightly oxygen rich, and trace impurities from the reaction mixture were undetectable.  
 
The Electrical Properties of the Films  
Film resistivity is closely correlated with carrier concentration and mobility. Change in the resistivities 
(ρ), carrier concentrations (n), and mobilities (μ) of the Mn-doped ZnO films are shown in Fig. 1 as a function 
of annealing temperature. The as-deposited thin films have high resistivities; hence annealing is needed to 
increase their conductivities. Figure 1a depicts the mobility and resistivity of a ZnO film before and after 
annealing, wherein the resistivity and mobility sharply decreases upon annealing at 400oC. The observed 
mobility reduction is due to ionized impurity scattering.10 The carrier concentration, however, abruptly 
increases as a function of increasing annealing temperature, resulting in the undoped ZnO film having a low 
resistivity of 2.9 × 10-2 Ωcm when it was annealed at 600oC. Mn doping was observed to clearly affect the 
resistivity of the film, and the mobility markedly decreased with increasing Mn content because of the 
increased carrier scattering due to the presence of ionized impurities. The Hall effect measurement results of 
the an Mn-doped ZnO film are illustrated in Fig. 1b-1d. When the film was annealed at 400oC, the mobility 
slightly decreased and the carrier concentration markedly increased, leading to a sharp decrease in film 
resistivity. The annealed film has a high carrier concentration, which clearly corresponds to the generation of 
oxygen vacancies11 and/or hydrogen atoms occupying the Zn-O bond center.12 In addition, the resistivity of 
the film is affected by grain boundary scattering when the mobility increases with carrier concentration.10 The 
4.0 at.% Mn-doped ZnO, 6.1 at.% Mn-doped ZnO, and 7.1 at.% Mn-doped ZnO films have resistivities of 5.8 
× 10-2 Ωcm, 1.1 × 10-1 Ωcm, and 4.3 × 10-1 Ωcm, respectively, when the films were annealed at 600oC. Film 
annealing induces grain growth and reduces grain boundary scattering; thus, film resistivity decreases when 
 11
the ZnO film via annealing increases the transmittance.16 The as-deposited Mn-doped ZnO films have high 
transmittances, which significantly decrease as a function of increasing annealing temperature. The average 
optical transmittance is 81.1%−75.6% for the 4.0 at.% Mn-doped ZnO film, 80.9%−74.9% for the 6.1 at.% 
Mn-doped ZnO film, and 81.8%−74.7% for the 7.1 at.% Mn-doped ZnO film. The decrease in film 
transmittance after annealing primarily derives from a decrease in transparency near the infrared region. 
Transmittance is well known to primarily depend on the film surface roughness, grain scattering and impurity 
scattering centers.17 In the Mn-doped ZnO film, the decrease in transmittance after annealing primarily results 
from increases in surface roughness, which will be described later. 
Table 2 also summarizes the optical energy bandgaps (Eg) of the investigated films, which were 
obtained by extrapolating of the linear region of the plot of (αhν)2 vs. hν.18 The energy bandgap of the ZnO 
film ranges from 3.13 eV to 3.23 eV. The energy bandgap ranges from 3.19 eV to 3.30 eV for the 4.0 at.% 
Mn-doped ZnO film, 3.30 eV to 3.11 eV for the 6.1 at.% Mn-doped ZnO film, and 3.31 eV to 3.17 eV for the 
7.1 at.% Mn-doped ZnO film. The absorption edge exhibits a blue shift as a function of increasing annealing 
temperature when the film is annealed in Ar+H2.19 
 
Magnetic Properties 
The magnetization of the Mn-doped ZnO films were measured as a function of the magnetic field at 
room temperature with subtracted substrate contribution. Figure 4a demonstrates that the as-deposited ZnO is 
paramagnetic; however, all of the Mn-doped ZnO films exhibit ferromagnetic behavior at room temperature, 
as shown in Fig. 4b-4d. For the as-deposited films, the as-deposited 4.0 at.% Mn-doped ZnO film has the 
highest saturation magnetization at 16.51 emu/c.c., and the saturation magnetization decreases with increasing 
Mn content in the ZnO film (saturation magnetization for the as-deposited 7.1 at.% Mn-doped ZnO is 7.26 
emu/c.c.). The saturation magnetization of the 4.0 at.% Mn-doped ZnO film reaches 20.1 emu/c.c; and the 
coercivity of the film is 45.7 Oe when the film was annealed at 600°C. The origin of room-temperature 
magnetic behavior in Mn-doped ZnO is not yet clear. Many studies have shown that room-temperature 
ferromagnetism mostly arises from secondary phases.20-22 Our study has not found any impurity phase, and an 
increase in Mn content would increase magnetism if the impurity phase were responsible for the 
ferromagnetic behavior; however, this phenomenon was not observed in this study because of the 
antiferromagnetic superexchange between Zn2+ ions and O2- ions, which enlarge the distance between 
adjacent Mn2+ ions.23 The 4.0 at.% Mn-doped ZnO film had the highest saturation magnetization because the 
distance between Mn2+ ions is optimized, which induces an adequate exchange interaction so as to enhance 
the magnetization.24,25  
The saturation magnetization of the Mn-doped film increases as the annealing temperature is increased. 
Annealing the film will increase the number of oxygen vacancies and decrease the distance between adjacent 
Mn2+ ions, such that the magnetization of the Mn-doped ZnO film can be enhanced. Among Mn oxides, MnO 
is antiferromagnetic, with a Néel temperature of ~96K, and Mn3O4 is ferromagnetic, with a Curie temperature 
of ~45K.25 Therefore, the room-temperature ferromagnetism in the films is caused by the ferromagnetic 
interaction between adjacent Mn ions that replace the Zn ions rather than by the Mn2+ oxide impurities.  
Oxygen vacancies have been suggested to play a crucial role in the magnetic origin for ZnO apart from 
magnetic doping. In this study oxygen vacancies can be easily introduced when the film is annealed in 
ambient Ar+H2 and results in long-range Mn-Mn ferromagnetic coupling. Only an appropriate concentration

Abstract 
Ru-Ta-C films deposited on silicon substrates were evaluated as barriers for copper metallization. The 
films were prepared by magnetron co-sputtering using a Ru target and a Ta-C target. Compositions and 
structure of resultant films were optimally tuned by the respective deposition power of each target. The 
fabricated Ru-Ta-C films were characterized via four-point probe measurement, X-ray diffractometry, 
field-emission electron probe microanalysis, and transmission electron microscopy. Failure temperature was 
evaluated by the sudden rise in electrical resistivity after annealing the sandwiched Cu/Ru-Ta-C/Si films, and 
a reference bi-layer Cu/5nm-Ru/5nm-(Ta-C)/Si schemes. The optimal ones are 10nm-Ru77Ta15C7 and 
5nm-Ru/5nm-(Ta-C). They both show a failure temperature of 650oC for 30 min and electrical resistivity less 
than 150 μΩcm. Because of their high thermal stability and low electrical resistivity, both Ru-Ta-C and 
Ru/Ta-C films are promising barriers for Cu metallization.

detect carbon and oxygen contents at a resolution of 0.5 atomic percent. X-ray diffraction with the 
conventional θ-2θ scan (XRD, MacScience M03XHF22, using Cu Kα1 radiation) was employed to 
characterize the film structure. Sheet resistance was measured on five different locations per sample at room 
temperature using a standard four-point probe technique. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL 
JSM-6360) was used to evaluate surface morphology of the films. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, 
JEOL JEM-2010, acceleration voltage 200 kV) was used to observe the cross-sectional microstructure of the 
sandwiched films.  
 
Results and Discussion 
Compositions and electrical resistivity of fabricated Ru-Ta-C films 
The compositions of the films analyzed using FE-EPMA are Ru82Ta12C5, Ru77Ta15C7, Ru68Ta21C10 and 
Ru52Ta32C15 corresponding to sputtering powers of Ru-target at 100 W, 75 W, 50 W and 25 W, respectively, 
keeping sputtering power of Ta-C target at 100 W. A very small amount of oxygen contamination (1.2 - 1.5 
atomic percent) is in the films. The composition of the films is denoted without oxygen. By fixing sputtering 
power at 100 W of Ta-C target, the ratio Ta:C in the films is 2.1 - 2.4 due to much different in sputter yield of 
Ta and C. Figure 1 plots electrical resistivity of the Ru-Ta-C films. Film resistivity decreases as a function of 
increasing ruthenium concentration. The electrical resistivity of the films decreases as a function of increasing 
sputtering power Ru-target; hence, the Ru82Ta12C5 film has the lowest resistivity of 92 μΩcm, whereas the 
Ru52Ta32C15 film has the highest resistivity of 278 μΩcm. The electrical resistivity of Ru-Ta-C films is 
strongly correlated with Ta-C content, and in particular, the associated structural changes in the films.10  
 
Characterization of annealed Cu/Ru-Ta-C/Si stacked films 
Ten-nm Ru-Ta-C films were stacked between 100nm-Cu and Si substrates and then annealed at a 
temperature between 300 and 700°C for 30 min to assess the applicability of the Ru-Ta-C barrier on Cu 
interconnects. The room temperature sheet resistance of the stacked films gradually decreases when the films 
were annealed at temperatures gradually up to 500°C, as shown in Fig. 2. This decreasing trend in sheet 
resistance of the film implies that the films are stable and free from the formation of intermetallic compounds. 
This implies that the Ru-Ta-C barrier effectively blocks intermixing between Cu and Si. In the studied films, 
room temperature sheet resistance of the stacked films Cu/10nm-Ru77Ta15C7/Si and the 
Cu/5nm-Ru/5nm-Ta-C/Si only slightly increase after annealing at 700 °C, as shown in Fig. 2. This indicates 
that Ru77Ta15C7 and Ru/Ta-C exhibit superior barrier performances in terms of preventing intermixing of 
materials between the layers. For stacked films Cu/Ru82Ta12C5/Si, Cu/Ru68Ta21C10/Si and Cu/Ru52Ta32C15/Si, 
the associated sheet resistance begins to increase after annealing at 650 °C and increases abruptly after 
annealing at 700 °C. Hence the barrier performance of Ru82Ta12C5, Ru68Ta21C10 and Ru52Ta32C15 are inferior 
to those of Ru77Ta15C7 and Ru/Ta-C. The penetration of Cu atoms through the barrier depends on the grain 
size and the shape of grain boundaries in the barrier. The structure of Ru77Ta15C7 is comparatively difficult for 
copper atoms to diffuse along the grain boundaries, thus the film shows superior barrier properties.10 Bi-layer 
structured Ru/Ta-C extends diffusion path along the grain boundary. Therefore, Cu diffusion along the grain 
boundary appears to be more difficult, and barrier-failure can be delayed to a higher temperature. The failure 
temperature of the Ru-Ta-C barrier in this study is much higher than that of Ru or Ta-C alone, revealing that 
Ru-Ta-C and Ru/TaC barriers are more effective in blocking Cu diffusion.

incorporate into Ru lattice since Ru has a solid solubility of carbon up to 3 at.% C at high temperatures. We 
denote it as Ru(C). In annealed Ru52Ta32C15 and Ru68Ta21C10, only Ru(C)(101) preferential diffraction shows 
up.10 The structure of Ru82Ta12C5 and Ru77Ta15C7 reveals a slight difference after annealing. The Ru77Ta15C7 
and Ru82Ta12C5 films have a mixed Ru(C)(002) and Ru(C)(101)-oriented crystallites when the film was 
annealed at an elevated temperature. The mixed (002) and (101) crystallites apparently provide a complicated 
path for Cu diffusion. Keeping in mind that intensity of (002)-orientated Ru(C) is higher in Ru77Ta15C7 film. 
The penetration of copper atoms along the grain boundary of the preferential-textured (002)-Ru(C) appears 
more difficult. Thus Ru77Ta15C7 exhibits a superior barrier property. 
This study shows that the 10-nm-thick Ru77Ta15C7 exhibits the best barrier performance and has a 
failure temperature at least 650 °C for 30 min. A barrier with the thickness of 10 nm is slightly too thick for 
the use in a sub-32 nm technology node, but the high thermal stability of the film is still applicable to practical 
semiconductor manufacturing processes. In our previous results, the failure temperature is at least 750°C for 1 
min in the 5-nm-thick barriers of Ru77Ta15C7 and Ta34Si47C18.10,11 The barrier performance for Ta34Si47C18 
mostly arises from its amorphous nature, and amorphous Ta34Si47C18 is thermally stable up to 800°C for 30 
min. As-deposited Ru77Ta15C7 film has nano-crystallite of Ru4Ta phase. Its barrier performance arises from the 
preferred nano-crystallinity of Ru(C)(002) and Ru(C)(101) in annealed film acting as an effective retarder to 
block Cu diffusion. Although the Ta34Si47C18 also has a superior performance, the resistivity of as-deposited 
Ta34Si47C18 is 349 μΩcm, and that of the 900°C-annealed film is 210 μΩcm.12 On the other hand, the 
resistivity of as-deposited Ru77Ta15C7 in this study is 143 μΩcm, and that of 900°C-annealed film is as low as 
20 μΩcm. Laurila et al. showed that the resistivity of Ta53C47 is 210 μΩcm, and the 7-nm-thick TaC fails at 
550°C for 30 min.13 For the ternary ruthenium nitride, the 15-nm-thick Ru-Ta-N on SiO2/Si substrate fails at 
900°C for 30 min; however, no related resistivity result has been shown.7 For the 10-nm-thick Ru-TiN barrier 
on SiO2/Si substrate, the film has a low resistivity of 190 μΩcm and has a failure temperature of 725°C for 30 
min.14 From the results shown above, our Ru77Ta15C7 film in this study is applicable as a barrier because of 
low electrical resistivity and high thermal stability.  
 
Conclusions 
Ru-Ta-C films were prepared by a co-sputtering method using Ru and Ta-C targets. The use of these 
films as barriers for Cu interconnects has been evaluated. The crystalline structure and the resistivity of 
Ru-Ta-C films can be easily controlled by adjusting the deposition power of the Ru target while keeping the 
Ta-C target at a constant power. 10nm-Ru77Ta15C7 and the reference 5nm-Ru/5nm-(Ta-C) exhibited the best 
barrier performance. The worked out failure temperature is at least 650 °C for 30 min for both films. Because 
of the low electrical resistivity and high failure temperature of the films Ru-Ta-C and Ru/Ta-C, both are 
promising as barriers for Cu metallization.

Seeking a highly thermally stable, grain-boundary-free barrier is thus essential. 
However, to date there has been relatively little study conducted on a highly 
thermally stable, ultrathin barrier. In our previous work, carbon was chosen for 
better controlling film composition and improving thermal stability of the ternary 
Ta–Si–C and Ru-Ta-C films. It led to a 5 nm thick Ta34Si47C18 film which has 
a failure temperature of at least 750°C while maintaining a reasonable resistivity 
of 340 &amp；micro；Ωcm. Moreover, the Ta–Si–C layer is highly compatible with 
integrated circuit processing, because these elements have been routinely adopted 
in today’s ultra-large scale integration technologies. However, previous reports 
did not disclose the failure mechanisms of such barrier layers. This work aims 
at exploring the evolution of barrier failure and tries to work out possible 
strategies of even thinner barriers, such as 2 nm, to comply with the 2016 ITRS 
roadmap. 
On the other hand, to improve the thermal stability of RuTa-based thin films, we 
chose carbon instead of nitrogen in this study and prepared the films without 
reactive sputtering for better control of the film composition of the ternary 
Ru–Ta–C films. We tested the barrier performance using a sandwich scheme 
involving Cu/Ru–Ta–C/Si. We also demonstrated the possibility of direct
