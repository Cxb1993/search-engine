一、 緣由與目的 
PPG(Photoplethysmography, PPG)信號具有取得容易以及蘊藏豐富生理資訊等優點，因此本
計畫最主要的目的在於，以 PPG 信號為主軸探討 PPG 信號與 ECG（Electrocardiogram, ECG）
信號的關係，除了找到兩信號之間的相關性之外，也由生理意義及實驗結果得知 PPG 與 ECG
信號同受心臟收縮與舒張影響的結果，儘管 PPG 信號與 ECG 信號兩者非常相似，但利用 PPG
信號求出之 HRPPG與利用 ECG 信號所求出之 HRECG，仍存在著些微差異，考慮這樣的差異在相
關研究中是極重要的。 
心肌細胞連續的去極化與再極化，促成了心臟肌肉的收縮，因而在人體內產生〝電流〞(事
實為離子流)，這樣遍佈全身的〝電流〞，可以使用黏貼皮膚表面的電極偵測出來，所偵測的信
號經過處理與描繪，最後以波形的形式顯示出來，我們稱為心電圖（ECG）信號，由 ECG 信號
可以得知人類的心跳頻率並不是非常規則的，在仔細的觀察下，可以發現每一跳與每一跳之間
有著些微的差異，如此的些微差異便是心率變異 (Heart rate variability, HRV)之定義，而心跳速
率 (Heart rate, HR)，除了與心搏量 (Stroke volume, SV)同為影響心輸出量 (Cardiac output, CO)
之重要因素外，也與交感神經 (Sympathetic nervous)以及副交感神經(Parasympathetic nervous)
之相互作用有著密不可分之關係 [1]。除此之外，心率變異之頻譜特性，也一直是評估各種心
血管功能不全與相關病症的重要依據，例如：心律不整、冠狀動脈疾病、心肌梗塞、糖尿病、
高血壓等等病症，在病症的評估與監測上，是一個相當重要的指標 [2]。但是心電圖在量測上
存在著若干值得改進的空間，例如：大部分心電圖量測侷限於靜態狀況下，較不適用於動態狀
況。另外，在擷取訊號時往往會有雜訊的出現，而雜訊的原因可能來自於儀器 (例如：EMI)或
者是人體本身（例如：其它生理訊號），多少會影響分析與評估。再加上心電圖為多點量測，
造成貼片與其它耗材浪費。 
PPG 信號是利用光感測元件吸收光線能量的原理，紀錄光線在血管中受血流脈動的變化而
偵測出來的信號。也就是說當心臟搏動週期，使得血管內單位面積的血流量產生變化，血液體
積若產生變動時，光感測元件將會隨著血液體積的變化而感應電壓，吸收最多光線的時期剛好
是心臟收縮的時期，所以 PPG 信號的振幅會隨血液進出組織成正比的變化 [3]。PPG 信號取得
簡單，在適當的信號前端處理之後，信號使用價值很高，由過去的文獻指出，可以利用 PPG 信
號瞭解交感神經之變化以及輔助心血管功能診斷 [4][5]，也可以藉由 PPG 信號來測得呼吸信號

中極重要的部分，再加上作者提出的幾種參數，可以正確找到每個 R 點，演算法細部介紹與步

步驟三：如果 S (n) > Slope_threshold 則繼續步驟四。 
步驟四：找出介於 Q 與 R 點之間的參考點，此點稱之為開始點 (onset point)。 
本研究利用以上四個步驟找出 ECG 信號之 R 點 (R point)，進而可以計算出 RRI。 
   2.3.2 HRPPG信號分析 
 本研究之 HRPPG是採用鄰近峰值偵測法 (Neighbering peak searching method)找出 PPG
信號中的峰值，如圖 1 所示，由資料開始時取兩個長度為 150 點之視窗，兩視窗之間相差 10
個資料點(此區域為比較區)，視窗二與波形交會點為參考點(即點 A)，開始在比較區內找尋有無
比 A 點大的值，按此步驟不斷向右邊移動，即可找到峰值 (P point)，進而可以計算出峰值間距
(Peak to peak interval, PPI)。

由實驗可證明出 PPG、ECG 信號間確實有著相關性，根據文獻指出，也可由 PPG 信號經

但是事實上 PPI 與 RRI 卻是在很靠近直線的地方分佈，因此可以明顯看出，兩信號並未完全等
同，即使相關係數極高的情況，依然也有著差異存在，因此由 ECG 信號取得之 HR 以及由 PPG
信號取得之 HR，兩者間是否可以互相取代？兩者間微小的差異是否代表著某些生理意義的不
同？這些都是需要釐清的，也是本研究之主要未來工作。

四、計劃成果自評 
本計畫著重於 PPG 信號與 ECG 信號之相關性探討，PPG 信號有著成本低廉、使用方便簡
單、使用上較不受限於人體部位等等優點，但同時也存在易受動作干擾的最大缺點，也直接影
響到分析的結果，因此信號量測時品質的篩選，後端濾波器的設計，在分析 PPG 信號都是值得
探討之處。 
有文獻記載 PPG 信號也可用於 HR 監測與 HRV 分析[7][8][9][10]，經由本計畫實驗結果發

Abstract 
During past decades, many researchers have 
been devoted to the study of the observation of ANS 
(autonomic nervous system) and the evaluation of 
cardiovascular function via PPG signal. PPG signal 
can  be used to derive heart rate (HR) signal and 
analyze the variability of HR. It has the advantages 
of being acquired easily and not affected in human 
situation. However, there are few advanced research 
has been done on the relationship between HRECG 
(ECG-derived HR) and HRPPG (PPG-derived HR).  
For this reason, the purpose of this study is to 
analyze ECG and PPG signal which are acquired 
simultaneously to estimate the correlation coefficient 
between RRI (R-R interval, RRI) and PPI (Peak to 
peak interval, PPI) for investigating the difference 
between HRECG and HRPPG. Ten healthy males are 
enrolled and the value of average correlation 
coefficient is 0.86±0.15. Although the physical 
meanings of ECG and PPG are different, HRECG and 
HRPPG have high correlation. However, there still 
exists difference between HRECG and HRPPG. Due to 
the little difference between PPG and ECG, the 
effect caused by the difference should be noticed HR 
for HR-related researches.

and suppression technique is depicted in 
Figure 1. It consists of a PLI detection module 
and an adaptive filter module. The flow of 
ECG signal in Figure 1 depends on the 
outcome of PLI detection. In the absence of 
PLI noise, the ECG signal will by-pass the 
adaptive filter unchanged. Only during a 
positive PLI detection, the adaptive notch filter 
will be applied to suppress the PLI noise. 
 
2.1 PLI detection 
A block diagram of the proposed PLI detection 
and suppression technique is depicted in 
Figure 1. It consists of a PLI detection module 
and an adaptive filter module. The flow of 
ECG signal in Figure 1 depends on the 
outcome of PLI detection. In the absence of 
PLI noise, the ECG signal will by-pass the 
adaptive filter unchanged. Only during a 
positive PLI detection, the adaptive notch filter 
will be applied to suppress the PLI noise. 
 
2.1.1 Feature extraction 
In the presences of PLI, the power spectrum of 
the corrupted ECG signal will have a narrow 
peak at the corresponding frequency that is 
much larger than power spectrum energy at 
surrounding frequencies. To exploit this 
characteristic feature of PLI, the observed 
signal x[n] is filtered with two adaptive IIR 
bandpass filter, HN (z, ρN, a) and HW (z, ρW, a) 
in parallel. Both filters have the same transfer 
function formula with different values of the 
parameter ρ (0 < ρ < 1) which we will denote 
as ρN and ρW:

with a＝−2 cos(2π⋅f0/fS). 
Such a filter has a pair of poles located at 
ρ⋅exp(±j2π⋅f0/fS) and a pair of zeros at ±1. 
The symbol fS denotes the sampling frequency 
and f0 is the fundamental frequency of the PLI. 
The constant A is chosen so that 
||H(exp(j2π⋅f0/fS),ρ,a)||＝ 1. For f0 ＝60 Hz 
and fS＝360 Hz, we choose ρN = 0.99 and 
ρW = 0.9 which yield a band-width of 1.1Hz 
and 12 Hz respectively. We compute the RMS  
values of the output of each BPF during each 
decision period to yield a 2-dimensional 
feature vector qk = [ q1[k]  q2[k] ]T.  
 
2.2.2 Pattern classification 
We choose the Fisher′s linear discriminant 
analysis (LDA) in this study for its simplicity 
and computational efficiency. The LDA 
classifier is briefly described as follows [6]. 
Given a feature vector q, a linear classifier 
computes a weighted linear combination of the 
feature vector q as follows. 
r = wTq + w0,

where, w is a weight vector and w0 is an offset

3. Results 
We evaluate the effectiveness of the PLI detection 
algorithm using MIT-BIH ECG database, and compare 
the performance of the proposed RLS PLI suppression 
filter with existing adaptive PLI suppression filters. 
3.1 Performance evaluation of the PLI 
detection 
The MIT-BIH arrhythmia database is the most widely 
used ECG signal database in public domain [8]. In 
general, ECG signals in this database are considered 
very clean in terms of PLI noise. However, as noted in 
[9], there is indeed evidence of tiny PLI noise in some 
of the data record. We have manually examined the 
power spectrum of the ECG signal in the entire 
MIT-BIH arrhythmia database over individual short 
segments, and label each record with one of two labels: 
″with 60-Hz PLI″ and ″without 60-Hz PLI″.  
We apply the LDA-based PLI detector to make a 
decision once per second. Thirty-minute length for each 
record in the database is adopted for analysis, it thus 
yields 1800 2×1 feature vectors for each record. The 
scatter plot of the total feature vectors is demonstrated 
in Figure 3 with ″+″ sign representing the features 
extracted from the records deemed corrupted by PLI, 
whereas the ″×″ sign indicating those from clean records. 
The LDA-based PLI detector yield a linear decision 
boundary as illustrated in Figure 3 in the form of a 
straight line. We then project each of the feature vectors 
into the subspace orthogonal to the decision boundary to 
compare the values of r. 
Given a particular threshold, we can compute the 
number of false negative and false positive detections as 
well as true positive and true negative detections. These 
statistics can then be converted into two commonly used 
performance criteria, specificity and sensitivity. Using 
different thresholds, different values of specificity and 
sensitivity can be computed. By connecting these pairs 
of values, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curve can thus be derived and is demonstrated in Figure 
4. It is highly desirable that the ROC curve is as close to 
the upper left corner as possible. The scale of the Y-axis 
(sensitivity) is enlarged to emphasize the specificity 
remains at unity with a sensitivity value exceeding 
99.8%, and this proves the PLI detector can attain our 
requirement even in ECG signal with only tiny PLI. 
Although some adaptive filtering techniques have been 
proposed for removing PLI in ECG signals [3-5], most 
of them used artificially corrupted ECG for the 
simulation purpose. Few studies have been evaluated by 
using practically PLI-corrupted ECG signal. In this 
study, a lead-II ECG signal is measured by a 
physiological signal acquisition system (MP30, BioPac 
System Inc.) at a sampling frequency of 500 Hz from a 
23-year-old male subject in supine status with the power 
mains across him parallel at a distance of 110 cm.

infrared (IR) light source will change with the pulsatile 
blood flow in the artery [2]. Therefore, the amplitude of 
PPG signal changes with time due to the cyclic change of 
blood volume in arteries during circulation. According to 
previous researches, PPG can help to evaluate 
sympathetic tone, cardiovascular function and respiratory 
volume [3-5]. PPG has the potential to monitor HR and 
HRV if the PPG signal is stable enough [6-9]. 
However, few researches have been done on 
whether any difference exists between ECG and PPG 
regarding HR and HRV. The main purpose of this study 
is to investigate the possible variation between the HRV 
analysis derived from ECG and PPG. The negative result 
may extend the applications of PPG in clinical diagnosis. 
This paper is organized as follows. The materials and 
methods utilized in this research will be introduced in 
section 2. Section 3 includes the results and related 
discussion. Finally, the conclusion is given in section 4. 
 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1 Materials 
Ten healthy subjects (all males aged from 25 to 35, 
and no prior history of cardiovascular disease) took part 
in this study. The subjects are asked to be free of coffee 
and alcoholic drinks at least three hours before each 
experiment. The laboratory environment is kept at room 
temperature, and the subjects are posed in a sitting 
position during the experiments. LeadⅡ ECG and PPG 
signals from the index fingers (left and right) are 
acquired simultaneously for each subject under the 
controlled conditions. The sampling frequency for both 
signals is 250 Hz. Only those high-quality signals with 
lasting over one minute are adopted for further analysis. 
The measurement device is MP30 (BIOPAC System 
Inc.), and the utilized sensor modules are SS2L for ECG 
and SS4L (with 860nm wavelength) for PPG 
measurement, respectively. The configuration for data 
acquisition is according to the assignments embedded in 
the package Biopac Student Lab Lessons & PRO for PC 
Version3.6.7 (BIOPAC System Inc.). The acquired 
signals are then analyzed in LabVIEW and MATLAB 
environment. 
2.2 Methods 
2.2.1 Data analysis 
To reduce the high-frequency interference and avoid 
the phase distortion, all of the raw ECG and PPG signals 
are conditioned by a DC-35Hz FIR filter before further 
analysis. The filtered signals are then used to acquire 
HRECG (heart rate derived from ECG signal) and HRPPG 
(heart rate derived from PPG signal). So and Chan’s 
algorithm is adopted for QRS detection [10], the 
non-evenly R-R interval sequences are then linearly 
interpolated according to the research by Berger et al (the 
sampling interval Δt equals 0.25sec in this research). [11]. 
The HRECG can thus be derived thereupon. 
For HRPPG, a neighboring peak searching method (as 
depicted in Figure 1) is adopted to derive the peak events 
of PPG signal in this research. In this method, two 
windows of 0.6-sec width with a 0.04-sec shift between 
them are selected empirically for peak searching. The 
PPG signal value at beginning of window 2 (the dashed 
one in Figure 1) is taken for a reference point (A). 
Moving along the PPG pattern from the reference point 
A, any value greater than the reference is selected as the 
candidate of peak. The peak is the greatest one in all 
candidates found in window 2. The two windows are 
then moved to next segment for another peak searching. 
The interval between the detected peaks is defined as the 
peak-to-peak interval (PPI). HRPPG is then acquired with 
the same procedure as that described above for the 
derivation of HRECG. All of the positions for derived R 
(from ECG) and P (from PPG) have been verified 
iteratively in this study.

If the two distributions are the same, then A=B and 
C=D for any threshold value and a unity LR can thus be 
derived. Therefore, the value of (1-LR) is used to 
evaluate the deviation between the distributions of 
LF/HF ratio derived from HRECG and HRPPG in this 
research. 
The processing flow for this study is summarized and 
demonstrated in Figure 4.

3. Results and discussion 
PPI and RRI sequences for all subjects are derived 
from the measured row ECG and PPG signals according 
to the methods described in previous section. In essence, 
the synchronous RRI and PPI sequence derived from the 
same subject should resemble much each other. One 
result is demonstrated in Figure 5. It can be appreciated 
there exists little difference between the RRI and PPI 
sequence demonstrated in Figure 5. Such difference can 
be distinguished more easily by its scatter diagram as 
shown in Figure 6, which should be a straight line with a 
unity slope for two identical sequences.

from subject No.06). 
 
 
Figure 6 One scatter diagram for RRI versus PPI (for 
subject No.06). 
 
  The correlation coefficients (CC) for all of the derived 
RRI and PPI sequences are summarized in TableⅡ. It is 
appreciated that some CCs are not as high as imagined 
(subjects No.04, No.05 and No.10). There have also been 
reports on the prevalence of interference on PPG signals 
due to the contact pressure of PPG sensor and due to the 
relative motion during measurement [8]. In such case, 
the PPG signals may be seriously degraded. For such 
possibilities, all of the PPG signals have been checked 
iteratively to assure the signal quality. As the peaks of 
PPG signal are much smoother than those in QRS 
complexes of ECG signal, this property makes the real 
peak not so apparent to locate especially for those PPG 
signals with smaller amplitude or those contaminated 
with high-frequency interference. This may be the reason 
of low CCs for these cases.

this goal, this paper proposes evaluation measures in 
both time and frequency domain to evaluate the 
performance of filters for such purpose. These 
quantifiable measures include the time needed for 
numerical convergence, the efficacy of PLI frequency 
tracking, execution time and the relative RMS statistics 
in time-and frequency-domain operation. The algorithms 
mentioned above (Ahlstrom and Tompkins’, Pei and 
Tseng’s, So’s and Ziarani and Konrad’s algorithm) are 
included for tests. The proposed evaluation methods may 
facilitate the design of optimal PLI filter for ECG signal 
processing. 
    
2. Materials and methods 
 
2.1 Subject and Device  
    The ECG signals used in this study were 
obtained from two resources. One was those 
acquired from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database 
(sampling frequency 360 Hz). The others were obtained 
in a university laboratory for electronic experiments. For 
the latter case, Lead II ECG signals were collected from 
10 male subjects aged 20-25 with MP30 (Biopac system 
Inc., sampling frequency 500Hz). Two procedures were 
conducted for ECG measurement. During the procedure 
of clean data measurement, power cord were positioned 
at least 1 meter away from the subject and all of the 
electronic equipment in the lab were turned off to make 
sure the ECG signal was not contaminated by PLI. To 
obtain ECG signals that were contaminated PLI, we used 
a desk lamp as a noise source and put a power line across 
the head of the subject. All of measured ECG signals 
have been checked via spectrum analysis to verify and 
ensure the classification. 
 
2.2 Data analysis 
    The following assessments were used for 
evaluation measures in this study: 
1) The time needed for numerical convergence: This 
term is used to evaluate the time consumption needed for 
the PLI removal to a specific level under the controlled 
condition that the simulated PLI with known 
characteristics is artificially added to a prescreened pure 
ECG signal. The needed times are estimated as the time 
consumption on which the following equation equals 1%, 
5% and 10%, respectively.

2) The efficacy of PLI frequency tracking: Regarding the 
efficiency of handling the PLI with slowly change 
frequency, the following two equations were used to 
simulate the PLI with in this experiment. One is

and the other one is:

tfwith ⋅+= 02.059 . 
(3)
 
The former equation is used to simulate the PLI with a 
slowly increasing frequency, whereas the latter one is for 
the cases with harmonic component in addition to the 
changing frequency and can be applied to observe 
whether the algorithm can track the PLI with harmonic 
component.  
 
3) The execution time: The execution time for each 
algorithm can be shown by Matlab® command, profile 
(with AMD® sempron 2600+, 2.13G Hz clock and 
512 MB RAM). 
 
4) The relative RMS statistics in time- and frequency-

3.2 The efficiency of PLI frequency tracking 
As described in the section “Materials and methods”, 
equation (2) and (3) were developed to simulate the PLI 
with slowly changing frequency and with harmonic 
component. The filtering results for a simulated PLI as 
defined in equation (2) and shown in Figure 4. It is easily 
appreciated that there lacks the capability of tracking PLI 
frequency for Ahlstrom and Tompkins’ and So’s 
algorithm. In So’s algorithm, the frequency of PLI 
should be known and fixed a priori [4]. Besides, there 
has been reported that the Ahlstrom and Tompkins’ 
algorithm is in fact an equivalent fixed notch filter [6]. 
For these reasons, the results shown in Figure 4 are 
reasonable in essence.  
 
Figure 4 The filtering results for PLI with slowly 
increasing frequency. 
 
 Figure 5 demonstrates the PLI with slowly 
increasing frequency and with a harmonic component as 
defined in equation (3). Obviously, only Ziarani and 
Konrad’s method has the ability to cancel the PLI with 
harmonic component because the specific core units for 
tackling fundamental and harmonic components can be 
arranged in parallel to serve the purpose [5].

increasing frequency and harmonic component. 
 
3.3 The execution time 
The execution time may imply the computational 
complexity of the algorithm. A clean ECG signal 
selected from MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (No. 112) 
with added simulated PLI (60 Hz sinusoid with 
amplitude of 1.5mV) was used as the input signal in this 
experiment. By using the command profile in Matlab® 
the execution time of each algorithm can be extracted. In 
order to assess the relationship between data length and 
execution time, signal lengths of 60 and 180 seconds 
have been used for the test (as shown in Table1). Pei and 
Tseng’s method has the shortest time consumption to 
reach 5% convergence (Figure 3). However, the 
execution speed of Ahlstrom and Tompkins’, Pei and 
Tseng’s and So’s method increase remarkably as the 
input signal length was tripled. 
 
3.4 The relative RMS statistics in time- and 
frequency-domain operation. 
The relative RMS statistics are derived according to 
 33
Konrad’s algorithm would be a better choice. In addition, 
Ziarani and Konrad’s method is the only one capable of 
removing serve PLI with harmonic component among 
the four methods.

4. Conclusion 
 
This study has presented quantitative evaluation 
measures for the performance assessments of the 
adaptive PLI filter in ECG signal processing. The results 
demonstrated that there is no universal optimum 
approach for this application thus far. Therefore, any 
algorithm can only be considered more feasible relative 
to the others for certain specific conditions. The 
quantifiable assessments in this study can help future 
research to optimize the filter parameters in different 
environments. Additionally, the information will also 
help to choose the most appropriate algorithm to process 
ECG signals in the specific circumstance.
