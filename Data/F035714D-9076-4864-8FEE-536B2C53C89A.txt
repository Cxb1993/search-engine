I. INTRODUCTION
Pulse waveform analysis (PWA) of the radial artery
is proven to be a better predictor of disease than the
traditional brachial artery pressure [1]-[2]. Recently,
there are many researchers study the pulse wave
measurement machine that can measure and record the
pulse wave pattern automatically [3]-[4]. Corresponding
disease diagnosis by PWA were also developed [5]-[8].
In this paper, we adopt a newly developed three-axis
sphygmography to measure pulse waveform, that include
two-axis mechanism and a standard positioning
procedure for detecting the optimal measurement site and
for accurately measuring the pulse waveform [3]. We
apply this instrument to measure pulse wave on this
myocardial ischemia study.
PWA had been applied to diagnose myocardial
ischemia previously [4]. In PWA analysis, harmonics
features are the standard features for diagnosis, such as
[9]-[11]. Harmonics feature is based on the spectrum of
pulse signals. It is a kind of frequency domain features.
Beside the harmonics features, a new feature, form factor
(FF), is also applied in this study. Form factor is a time
domain features that comes from the ratio of signal
standard deviation. FF is also used in biomedical signal
analysis, such as EEG [12] and ECG [13]. FF is very
sensitive to noise, and it only suit for the narrow band
signals, not for wide band signal, such as EMG. Pulse
signal is a narrow band signals, and it’sthe first time to
apply FF to the pulse analysis, to the best of author’s
knowledge.
In this paper, we also develop a modified fuzzy
c-means clustering algorithm to identify myocardial
ischemia, based on the features derived from harmonic
and FF. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve
is also used to determine the optima decision function.
Furthermore, negative group patients are also used to test
the clustering algorithm performances.
II. METHOD
A. Pulse Wave Measurement
A three-axis pulse measurement system with
modified sensor was used [3], which could measure the
pulse waveform (using a pressure transducer) and the
ADC (using a strain gauge) simultaneously. The
waveform signals were recorded using a digital analog
acquiring card (National Instrument PCI 6014, with
bandwidth 0.1~40 Hz) with LabView software for data
retrieval and manipulation. The pressure-sensor gain was
100, the strain-gauge gain was 1000, the sampling
frequency was 500 Hz, and the pressure sensor was
calibrated using a mercury-column pressure gauge.
B. Subject Information
During the waveform measurement, each subject was
asked to sit on a height-adjustable chair. The subject’s 
hand was placed on a table at the same horizontal height
with the heart. The palm pointed upwards and the wrist
was placed on a soft pillow. Each subject records his right
hand and left hand, and each hand with three specific
measurement positions that is illustrated in Fig. 1. Total
six pulses recorded for each subject, and each pulse
record is three second.

All decision function has corresponding
sensitivity-specificity pairs. ROC curve is drawn
according these sensitivity-specificity pairs. Optima
decision function is chosen based on the corner of the
ROC curve, which is drawn as line B in our study.
Result
A. Pulse Data and Statistics
Traditional pulse signal contains one major peak
and two following minor peaks within one period. Minor
peaks of myocardial ischemia patients are more
insignificant than that of normal group. Figure 2
illustrates the typical pulse wave of myocardial ischemia
patients (positive group) and normal subjects.
Corresponding harmonics and FF values are also
demonstrated.
Table 2 lists the mean harmonic features and FF
feature values. Their corresponding t-test p values
between positive group and normal group on the same
features are also included. According to Table 2, H2, H4
and H3 are the three most significant harmonic features,
and their p values are 0.002, 0.024 and 0.014,
respectively. In the following experiment, H2, H3 and H4
are chosen as FCM clustering input features. FF has lower
p values than harmonics features, especially on the left
hand (p=0.0001). Normal group has higher FF values
than that of positive group. There are three measuring
position on the hand, and the PWA measured from the
three different point on the left hand are all have
significant statistically differences (P<0.05) between
normal and positive groups in FF feature. LF1, LF2 and
LF3 are also chosen as following features.

patients (positive group) and normal subjects are

B. Feature Distributions and FCM
The lower p value features, shown in table 2,
between positive and normal group are chosen as features
for further analysis. There are various combinations of
the features. At first, the feature distribution would be
drawn to show the distribution. Figure 3 is the illustration
of feature distribution plot by H2 and H4 pairs of all
subjects. The normal group is marked square, and the
diamond mark is the positive group. Several feature
combinations are also used as FCM input features, even
with two or three features, with harmonics or FF or both
together. Table 3 list all the feature combinations used in
the following study.

C. Decision Function, ROC curve and Clustering
Performance
After the FCM clustering steps for selected features,
two cluster centers and two separate clustering groups are
determined. Original decision function is determined by
the perpendicular bisector on the cluster centers. One
decision function has one sensitivity-specificity pairs to

have chest pain but diagnosed as no myocardial ischemia
after treadmill ECG examination. Higher percentages of
negative group are clustered as normal by harmonics
featured than FF features (61% vs. 18%), Back to the
sensitivity-specificity definition, this phenomenon can be
understood. Remind the definition in equation (8) and (9),
higher specificity means higher FN, and that means
higher recognition on the normal group; higher sensitivity
means higher TP and that means higher recognition on
the positive group. Harmonics features have 100%
specificity, and negative group featured by harmonics has
higher rate to be classified as normal group. FF features
have 100% sensitivity, and negative group featured by FF
has higher rate to be classified as positive group.
Conclusion
A PWA based myocardial ischemia classification
system was developed and tested. With the harmonics
and form factor features of pulse, higher identification
specificity and sensitivity are achieved. Resulted are
compared with the negative group. This system is a
non-invasive and it is fast to measure PWA. It is a good
candidate to screen the myocardial ischemia patients
before further treadmill ECG examinations. A future
study will focus on the selection of pulse features and
apply nonlinear discrimination algorithm to improve the
myocardial ischemia patient screening rate.
