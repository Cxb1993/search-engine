this study to the scope of infinite products of fuzzy matrices. Guu et al.[13] studied the limiting behavior
of infinite product of fuzzy matrices. Lur et al.[14] proposed the notion of simultaneous nilpotent and
simultaneous control for a finite set of fuzzy matrices. In this report, we shall extend their study for an
infinite set of n × n fuzzy matrices. Some necessary and sufficient conditions for a set of n × n fuzzy
matrices to be simultaneously controllable will be established. We also give a constructive algorithm
which can determine a finite set of n× n fuzzy matrices being simultaneously controllable.

Let F denote the unit interval, i.e., F = [0, 1]. By a fuzzy matrix A we mean A = [aij ] with aij ∈ F.
Let Fm×n denote the set of all the m × n fuzzy matrices and let Fm denote the set of all m × 1 fuzzy
matrices. For a fuzzy matrix A = [aij ], we may denote aij by [A]ij . For any fuzzy matrices A and B of
the same size,
[A ∨B]ij = aij ∨ bij := max{aij , bij}.
If A ∈Fm×l and B ∈Fl×n, then the product A⊗B of A and B is defined as follows:
[A⊗B]ij :=
l∨
k=1
(aik ∧ bkj),
where aik ∧ bkj := min{aik, bkj}. For any fuzzy matrices A and B of the same size, we say A ≤ B if
aij ≤ bij for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n. A ∈Fn×n is called strictly lower triangular if aij = 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n.
For λ ∈ [0, 1], [λ ⊗ A]ij = λ ∧ aij . Let AT denote the transpose of A and let Ak⊗ be the k-th power of
A. Let F be a (finite or infinite) set in Fn×n. F is called simultaneously controllable if there exists a
permutation matrix P such that for each A ∈ F , C = [cij ] = P ⊗ A ⊗ PT satisfies cij ≥ cji for i > j.
For k ∈ N, let Fk be the set of all products of matrices in F of length k, that is,
Fk := {A1 ⊗A2 ⊗ · · · ⊗Ak : Ai ∈ F for i = 1, 2, · · · , k}.
In Hashimoto [5], for A = [aij ] ∈ Fn×n, the matrices 4A = [4aij ] and ∇A = [∇aij ] are defined by
4aij :=
{
0 if aij ≤ aji,
aij otherwise
and ∇A := A ∧AT .
Hashimoto [5] proved A = 4A∨∇A. We denote 4F := {4A : A ∈ F}. For λ ∈ [0, 1], we follow [15]
to define for any fuzzy matrix A the λ-level cut matrix Aλ by
[Aλ]ij =
{
1 if aij ≥ λ,
0 otherwise.
It is obviously that for any two λ1, λ2 ∈ [0, 1] with λ1 ≤ λ2, Aλ1 ≥ Aλ2 . We let ΦA denote the set of all
nonzero elements of A and let ΦF :=
⋃
A∈F ΦA. Fan and Liu [3] showed the decomposition theorem :

,
where Ps = P (s, is + s− 1), s = 1, 2, · · · , t.
If for each 4A ∈ 4F , A˜t is strictly lower triangular,
then let P = Pt ⊗ · · · ⊗ P2 ⊗ P1, for each A ∈ F , we have C = [cij ] =
P ⊗A⊗ PT with cij ≥ cji for i > j
end.

Powers of fuzzy matrices play an important role in the performance of fuzzy system modelling. Most
of the study in asymptotic forms of fuzzy matrices investigated in the literature focused on the limiting
behavior of consecutive powers of a fuzzy matrix. Recent development has extended this study to the
scope of the infinite products of a finite number of fuzzy matrices.
In the study of consecutive powers of a fuzzy matrix, the class of controllable fuzzy matrices including
idempotent, transitive, strongly transitive fuzzy matrices has been proposed by Li. Recently, Lur, Pang
and Guu have introduced the notion of simultaneous control for a set with finite fuzzy matrices. In this
report, we explored properties of simultaneous control for a set with infinite fuzzy matrices. Some results
for simultaneous control of a finite set of fuzzy matrices were established. A constructive algorithm which
can determine a simultaneously controllable set of n× n fuzzy matrices was presented as well.
