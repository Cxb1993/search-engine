Abstract 
Today’s wired networks based on fiber to the 
home (FTTH) access technologies provide 
huge bandwidth to users but are not flexible 
enough to allow roaming connections. 
Therefore, the integration of wired and 
wireless services for future access networks 
will lead to convergence of ultimate high 
bandwidth for both fixed and mobile users in 
a single, low cost platform. This can be 
accomplished by using radio-over-fiber 
(ROF) systems and wavelength division 
multiplexed passive optical network 
(WDM-PON) to provide wireless and wired 
applications. 
This NSC project focus on the research 
of Rayleigh backscattering (RB) noise 
modeling, analysis and mitigation for WDM 
passive optical networks (PONs) and 
radio-over-fiber (ROF) Networks. In the first 
 4
the RB and the upstream signal are traveling 
in opposite directions. Finally, we propose 
and demonstrate a heterogeneous optical 
access network using wavelength-splitting 
(WS) at remote-node (RN) to mitigate the 
RB noises. A pair of continuous wave 
carriers is generated from each laser for 
wired (PON) and wireless (ROF) 
applications respectively. Results show that 
the scheme can effectively mitigate RB 
noises.  
   
三、研究成果 
This project focuses on the research of 
Rayleigh backscattering (RB) noise modeling, 
analysis and mitigation for WDM PONs and 
ROF networks. Due to different limitations 
of previous RB noise modeling, a novel 
modeling approach that can be easily realized 
and used efficiently to study the performance 
of noise mitigation has been successfully 
developed. The various noise contributions 
are derived from the power spectral densities 
(PSDs) of the optical signals. We 
characterized experimentally [1] and 
theoretically [2] different contributions of the 
RB in a carrier-distributed PON at different 
optical signal to Rayleigh noise ratios 
(OSRNRs). Recent achievement of OFDM 
PON has been presented in CLEO’08 
post-deadline paper in USA [3]. The 
achievements of the project have generated 
invited paper, invited talks and book chapter. 
We are invited to present our research 
achievements and impact of the FTTH for 
Taiwan in the Special Issue of the IEEE 
LEOS Newsletter about FTTx [4]. We has 
also been invited to contribute 2 Book 
Chapters in “Optical Access Networks and 
Advanced Photonics: Technologies and 
Deployment Strategies,” IGI Global 
Publishing [5] and in “Advances in Lasers 
and Electro Optics,” In-Tech Publishing [6]. 
Our results and achievement in long-reach 
PON has been cited by Ref/Text Book: 
“Next-Generation FTTH Passive Optical 
Networks: Research towards unlimited 
bandwidth access,” edited by Josep Prat, 
Springer, 2008. We are also invited to 
present our researches of FTTx in 
international conferences, such as: 
y IEEE Photonics Society Annual Meeting 
2010 (formerly LEOS Annual Meeting) in 
USA [7],  
y Photonic West 2009 in USA [8],  
y International High Speed Intelligent 
Communication 2010 (HSIC 2010) in 
Singapore [9],  
y OECC 2011 in Taiwan [10]  
y OECC 2009 in Hong Kong [11].  
 
We have summarized the main achievements 
below:  
 
(1) Rayleigh backscattering modeling using 
power spectral density [1, 2] 
Carrier distributed WDM-PONs provide 
many attractive features, however, when a 
single drop fiber is used to reach the 
customer, the carrier distributed from the 
head-end office and the upstream signal must 
share the same path, giving rise to 
interferometric beat noise caused by RB. The 
maximum split ratio achievable in the PON 
is limited by the levels of RB and back 
reflection present in the system. RB is 
generated by the distributed reflections 
caused by the random index fluctuation along 
the silica optical fiber. The RB noise is 
partially polarized in nature, with a colored 
power spectral density (PSD) proportional to 
the PSD of the generating input signal. This 
is different from the ASE, which is typically 
assumed to be a white noise. In the project, 
we identified two main contributions to the 
RB noise. Fig. 1.1 shows the two dominant 
contributions to the RB in the carrier 
distributed PONs, which interfere with the 
upstream signal at the receiver (Rx). The first 
contribution, Carrier-RB, is generated by the 
backscatter of the continuous wave (CW) 
carrier being delivered to the reflective ONU 
(RONU). The second contribution, 
Signal-RB, is generated by the modulated 
upstream signal at the output of the RONU. 
Backscattered light from this upstream signal 
re-enters the RONU, where it is 
 6
loop-back configuration was achieved by an 
optical circulator (OC). The distributed CW 
carrier was coupled into the DP-MZM. It was 
electrically driven by a 10 GHz RF 
up-converted 2.5 Gb/s NRZ signal at 
pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) 
231-1 in-phase and quadrature-phase 
respectively. The upstream single sideband 
carrier suppressed (SSB-CS) signal was then 
sent back to the CO through the same drop 
fiber, a red/blue (R/B) filter and an arrayed 
waveguide grating (AWG) (Gaussian shaped, 
3-dB width of 50 GHz) at the RN. Then the 
upstream signal was sent back to the receiver 
(Rx) at CO via 75 km SMF feeder fiber. No 
dispersion compensation was used in the 
experiment.  
Fig. 2.2 shows the measured optical spectra 
(resolution of 0.01 nm) of the distributed CW 
carrier and the SSB-CS NRZ upstream signal 
after the RONU. The suppression ratio of the 
upstream signal and the center wavelength 
are > 18 dB. The RB tolerance can be 
significantly improved by the reduction in 
the spectral overlap.

Dotted line: centralized light source (CLS). 
Fig. 2.3(a) and (b) show the bit-error rate 
(BER) performance of the upstream SSB-CS 
NRZ signal and the conventional NRZ in the 
LR-PON respectively. We measured ~5 dB 
power penalty in the SSB-CS signal when 
the split-ratio was 512 (VOA set at >-26 
together with the 3-dB fiber coupler prior the 
VOA), without an error-floor. In Fig. 2.3(b), 
the conventional NRZ was not able to 
achieve 64-split and an error-floor appeared 
at BER of 10-7. BER cannot be measured at 
split-ratio of 512 at the conventional NRZ 
case due to the nearly complete eye-closure 
(inset of Fig. 2.3(b)).

using SSB-CS and (b) conventional NRZ signal. Insets: 
corresponding eye diagrams Insets show the corresponding eye 
diagrams. 
In conclusion, by using the SSB-CS 
upstream signal generated by a commercially 
available DP-MZM based colorless ONU, 
both kinds of RB noise sources can be 
effectively mitigated. A reach extension from 
typical 20 km PON to 100 km LR-PON with 
split-ratio increases from 64 to 512 is 
achieved in the proposed network 
architecture. 
(3) Rayleigh backscattering circumvention 
in ring-based PON [21] 
Fig. 3.1 shows the proposed ring-based 
WDM PON. The CW optical carrier sent 
from the CO is traveling in the 
counter-clockwise (CCW) direction. At the 
RN, wavelengths will be dropped according 
to the wavelength selection by the tunable 
fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs). The dropped 
CW and the downstream signal will be

Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) at the RN, 
which was electrically driven at Δf (25 GHz). 
The Carrier-RB will be generated by the CW 
carrier (Fig. 3.4(b)). The MZM at the RN 
will produce two optical sidebands which is 
50 GHz apart with suppression of the center 
wavelength (Fig. 3.4(c)). Then, each 
sideband was filtered by a 50-GHz channel 
spacing arrayed waveguide grating (AWG3), 
producing a pair of optical carriers (f0+Δf, 
f0-Δf) (Fig. 3.4(d), (e)). AWG1 and AWG3 
were aligned to f0+Δf, while AWG2 was 
aligned to f0. The two optical carriers (f0+Δf, 
f0-Δf) will be modulated at the ONU/RAU, 
forming the upstream signals for PON and 
ROF respectively (Fig. 3.4(f)).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 3.4. Architecture of wired and wireless network using 
wavelength splitting, with different schematic optical spectra at 
different locations. 
The upstream signals will bypass the MZM 
in the RN by using the two optical circulators 
(OCs) configuration, and detected by the 
head-end Rx. The upstream data will also be 
backscattered by the SMF towards the RN, 
where it will be wavelength split again, and 
blocked by the AWG3. Back-reflection by 
the AWG3 and the power leakage by the OC2 
will contribute to the Signal-RB launching to 
the head-end Rx (Fig. 3.4(g)). As shown in 
the schematic optical spectra of Fig. 3.4(h) at 
the head-end before AWG1, the Carrier-RB 
is at frequency f0, while the 
double-modulated Signal-RB has the 
frequency components of f0 and f0±2Δf. This 
shows that ideally there is no spectral overlap 
between the upstream data and both types of 
RB. Besides, the frequency components of 
the RB will be highly attenuated by the 
AWG1 to further enhance the RB tolerance.

and without WS. Insets: corresponding eye-diagrams. Inset: Optical 
spectra of the f0-Δf, f0+Δf generated by the MZM. 
We also evaluated the transmissions of the 
upstream signals by encoding the NRZ (for 
PON) and OFDM-QAM (for wireless) in the 
proposed network without and with using 
WS. 2.5 Gb/s pseudorandom binary sequence 
(PRBS) 231-1 NRZ data and 16-QAM OFDM 
signal were applied to the EAM respectively. 
The OFDM signal consisted of 16 subcarrier 
symbols and in 16-QAM format, generated 
by an arbitrary waveform generator with 4 
GHz sampling rate. The OFDM signal was 
RF up-converted, occupying ~1 GHz of RF 
spectrum (from 62.5 MHz to 1,125 MHz).

performances of the NRZ and OFDM signals 
with and without WS. ~4 dB power penalty 
was observed in the NRZ signal (16 
split-ratio) without WS. Error-floor at 10-8 
was observed when the split-ratio was 
increased to 32. In Fig. 3.6, error-floors of

Prof. Ping-kong Alexander Wai of the PolyU served as the Conference Chair, and Prof. Kin 
Chiang of City University of Hong Kong undertook the role of Technical Program Committee 
(TPC) Chair. More than 500 participants from 25 countries attended the conference. These 
papers were attributed to 7 technical categories: Emerging Technologies; Optical Fiber and 
Waveguide Devices; Optical Networks and Broadband Access; Optical Sensors and Systems; 
Optical Signal Processing; Optoelectronic Materials, Devices and Modules; and Transmission 
Systems and Switching Technologies.  
 
 
  
 There were total 360 papers accepted which was equivalent to an overall acceptance rate of 
81%. Among them, 280 papers were accepted for oral presentation and 80 for poster 
presentation. 
  
 The first day (Monday) is the Workshop section. There are 4 workshops: “MWA Specialty 
Optical Fibers, Where is the Next Big Breakthrough?”, “MWB Optical Fiber Sensors: 
Overview and Opportunity”, “MWC Power LED Materials and Devices for Solid-state 
Lighting”, “MWD Next-generation Broadband Optical Access - Future Challenges”. I am one 
of the invited speakers in the workshop of “Next-generation Broadband Optical Access - 
Future Challenges” invited by Prof. Chinlon Lin of Nanyang Technological University in 
Singapore and Prof. L. K. Chen of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The invited 
speakers were from academic (e.g. Nagoya Univ, NCTU, Chinese University of Hong Kong, 
National Kaohsiung Univ. of Applied Science, etc…) to industry (e.g. NTT, Huawei, NEC, 
OKI, Bookham, etc…) In this workshop, each speaker can have 10 minutes presentation and 
the followed by an open discussion. Together with the audiences, we discussed a lot in the 
area of future broadband access network, including the deployment issues in different 
countries, issues of WDM implementation, cost-sharing, bandwidth allocation, network 
protection, etc…

 The third paper is “ThLP69 - Fabry-Perot Laser Based Wavelength Converter without 
External Injection.” In this paper, we propose an all optical wavelength converter using a 
multi-longitudinal-mode Fabry-Perot laser diode without any external probe beam or external 
build-in cavity. The proposed converter apparatus is simple and cost-effective for WDM 
network applications. Error-free operation is confirmed by using bit-error rate (BER) 
measurements.

of uplink when the downlink signals are injected into 
RSOAs after 100 km transmission. For this measurement, 
a 2.5 Gb/s non-return-to-zero (NRZ) with pseudo 
random binary sequence (PRBS) pattern length of 2311
is used to directly modulate the RSOAs. Then the uplink 
wavelengths launch back to the HE Rx for eye diagram 
and bit error rate (BER) measurements through the 
second fiber path, as shown in Fig. 1. As a result, the 10 
Gb/s uplink traffic can be performed by using four 
wavelength-multiplexed 2.5 Gb/s optical-injection 
RSOAs.

1541.7, 1542.9 and 1544.1 nm, respectively. (b) Four output spectra of

Fig. 3. The eye diagrams with the injected powers of (a) -10, (b) -12, 
(c) -14 and (d) -16 dBm, respectively. 
To ensure the RSOA can be directly modulated at 2.5 
Gb/s data rate, different optical injected-power level is 
used. We use the 1540.1 nm wavelength injecting into 
RSOA under different injection power. Figs. 3(a) to 3(d) 
show the eye diagrams with the injected powers of -10, -
12, -14 and -16 dBm, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3(a), 
the clear wide open eye can be achieved with the 
injection power of -10 dBm. That is to say, if the RSOA 
want to achieve and maintain at 2.5 Gb/s modulation, the 
external-injection power must to be larger than -10 dBm 
at least.
In this measurement, the measured constellation 
diagrams of the downlink signal at back-to-back (B2B) 
and after transmission of 100 km SMF are shown in Fig. 
4(a). We can observe that the each constellation point, 
which is condensed, with good separation among others 
through 100 km fiber, even the extinction ratio of the 
OFDM signal is ~ 4 dB. The results verify the baseband 
frequency domain equalizations have been successfully 
performed to demodulate the relatively low extinction 
ratio of the OFDM signal. Fig. 4(b) present the output

OFDM 16-QAM and NRZ remodulation with 4 and 2.5 Gb/s data 
traffic, respectively. 
Fig. 5 shows the BER measurements of both downlink 
and uplink traffic of the OFDM 16-QAM and NRZ 
remodulation at 4 and 2.5 Gb/s data traffic, respectively, 
at the wavelength of 1540.1 nm. About 1.8 and 1 dB 
power penalties of OFDM-QAM downlink and 
remodulated NRZ signals are observed at BER of 10-9
after 100 km transmission distance without dispersion 
compensation. The proposed ER TDM-PON architecture 
can be a potential candidate for the new generation 10G 
TDM-PON systems. 
Conclusions
This work shows and experimentally investigates an ER-
TDM-PON using four wavelength-multiplexed 
wavelengths to achieve 16 Gb/s downlink and 10 Gb/s 
uplink traffic based on OFDM and OOK modulations, 
respectively.

wavelength spectra of the proposed tunable fiber laser is 
shown in Fig. 2, over the operating range of 1526.65 to 
1562.35 nm with 1.15 tuning step. Thus, we can see 
clearly that single longitudinal mode outputs can be 
obtained by the proposed laser scheme. Then, we 
characterize the proposed laser scheme. Fig. 3 presents 
the output power and SMSR of the proposed fiber laser 
under different lasing wavelengths in the operating range 
of 1526.65 to 1562.35 nm with 1.15 tuning step. In the 
operating range, the output power and SMSR are larger 
than -6.5 dBm and 30.5 dB respectively. While the 
tuning range is between 1531.0 and 1562.35 nm, the 
output power and SMSR is above -4.0 dBm and 30.5 dB 
respectively. The maximum output power of -0.8 dBm is 
obtained at the wavelength of 1550.95 nm with 43.1 dB 
SMSR. The maximum output lasing wavelength matches 
the maximum output of the MLM FPLD. It is also worth 
to mention that we can equalize the output powers of the 
proposed laser with variation less than 2 dB, in the 
wavelength range of 1531.0 and 1562.35 nm by proper 
controlling the bias currents of the FPLD and the RSOA.
To investigate the performance of the proposed fiber 
laser in the ONU, bit error rate (BER) measurement in a 
long reach PON distance is performed without 
dispersion compensation. In the experiment, we set the 
lasing wavelength at 1545.40 nm with -1.1 dBm output 
power for upstream transmission. The RSOA is directly 
modulated at 1.25 Gb/s with a NRZ pseudo random 
binary sequence (PRBS) to produce the upstream optical 
on-off keying (OOK) signal. Fig. 4 shows the BER 
curves for the upstream connection in WDM-PON at 
back-to-back (B2B), 25, 50, 75 and 100 km SMF 
transmissions, respectively. The insets of Fig. 4 are the 
corresponding eye diagrams at the BER of 10-9. We can 
observe that clear wide open eyes can be seen in all 
cases. The power penalty of ~0.8 dB at the BER of 10-9
was measured after 100 km transmission distance.  
Hence, we believe that the proposed scheme using 
MLM FPLD and RSOA based fiber laser can be 
operated at 2.5 Gb/s for long reach WDM-PON by using 
optimized optical components, such as higher power 
FPLD or lower insertion loss TBF.  
Conclusions
We proposed and experimentally demonstrated a simple 
wavelength-tunable fiber laser based on optical-injection 
of a RSOA in each ONU for upstream transmission in a 
long reach WDM-PON. In the laser scheme, a locally 
located MLM FPLD serves as the injection light source. 
The tuning range of RSOA-based fiber laser is between 
1526.65 and 1562.35 nm with single longitudinal mode 
operation. The output performances of output power and 
SMSR for the fiber laser have been also discussed and 
analyzed. The laser can be directly modulated at 1.25 
Gb/s with ~0.8 dB power penalty after 100 km SMF 
transmission.

In this experiment, we select the central wavelength of 
FP-LF to act as the converted wavelength (converted) due 
to the highest power of converted. When the input injects 
into the FP-LD, the output spectrum of FP-LD without 
passing through the BF is shown in Fig. 3 by green short 
dash line. Fig. 3 also shows the two highest peak 
wavelengths at 1537.32 and 1542.87 nm, respectively, 
after the launching of input. Compared with the third 
higher peak wavelength in Fig. 3, the side-mode 
suppression ratio (SMSR) of the selected converted and 
input are 23 and 18 dB.  
By comparing the optical spectra of the FP-LD before 
(Fig. 2) and after the launching of input (Fig. 3), we can 
see that this conversion mechanism is different form the 
wavelength conversion based on pump-probe 
wavelength injection locking or self-injection locking. 
We can see that the input signal does not suppress other 
side-modes of the FP-LD, but its power has been 
depleted to the made mode (central wavelength) of the 
FP-LD. That is to say, the power of the converted is 
increased due to this mechanism. The output spectrum of 
FP-LD after passing through the BF, the converted is also 
illustrated in Fig. 3 by blue solid line. 
In this measurement, the input signal input is 
modulated by external Mach-Zehnder (MZ) modulator at 
625 Mbps, 1.25 Gbps and 2.5 Gb/s, respectively, using 
the NRZ pseudo random binary sequence (PRBS) with 
pattern length of 2311. Thus, Fig. 4 shows the eye 
diagrams at 2.5 Gb/s, 1.25 Gb/s and 625 Mb/s data rate, 
respectively, of the input signal input and the converted 
signal converted. They are all clear and widely opened 
under various modulated rates. Besides, In order to 
realize the wavelength conversion performance, bit-
error-rate measurements are performed. Fig. 5 shows 
that the converted operation leads to ~3.5 dB power 
penalty at the BER of 10-9 under 2.5 Gb/s NRZ 
modulation. It is also worth to mention that the 
wavelength conversion is not based on pump-probe 
wavelength injection locking or self-injection locking. 
Hence, it is not sensitive to the polarization of the input 
signal. We observe that polarization dependence of the 
input signal is less than 2 dB at BER of 10-9. 
 
Conclusions
We propose an all optical wavelength converter using a 
multi-longitudinal-mode Fabry-Perot laser diode without 
any external probe beam or external build-in cavity. The 
proposed converter apparatus is simple and cost-
effective for WDM network applications.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
The achievements of light emitting diode (LED) 
efficiency and the dramatically reduction in cost enable LED 
to be widely deployed in applications, such as traffic light, 
car indicators, as well as both in-door and out-door 
illumination systems. LED has the advantages of less power 
consumption, rigid, compacted size, long lifetime, and easily 
integratable in different products. In the near future, high-
brightness LED (HB-LED) will replace the conventional 
incandescent and fluorescent lamps for both in-door and out-
door lightings. When comparing with the traditional 
incandescent light, LED consumes ~80% less energy at the 
same lumen output. Recently, the energy efficiency of LED 
has already surpassed that of fluorescent lamps, making it 
one of the most efficient lighting sources in the market [1]. 
LED is generally regarded as a ‘green’ light source. It does 
not contain harmful materials such as mercury. Its high 
energy efficiency helps to reduce the emission of global 
warming gases since less electricity is consumed.  
LED has the unique characteristics which make it 
irreplaceable by other kinds of light sources. The visible-
light LED can be modulated at a relatively higher speed 
(MHz range) than the traditional lighting sources, such as 
fluorescent lamps. Hence, it is possible to integrate the 
optical wireless communication (or visible light 
communication, VLC) with the LED illumination system for 
in-building short range applications.  
 
LED illumination system with the value-added 
functionality of VLC enables the deployment of in-building 
and home communication system with very little extra cost. 
This can be a secure link between mobile devices. Since the 
light beam is visible, users can securely select the 
communication target by controlling the light beam direction, 
hence other people cannot “steal” the information. Besides, 
the optical power does not penetrate through walls, hence 
there is no interfere with users in other rooms. VLC can be 
used for information broadcast (e.g. multilingual 
interpretation system) in museums and galleries. It is 
important to note that VLC is irreplaceable in some areas 
where RF communication is prohibited, such as in hospital or 
in an aircraft, where using RF wireless communication is 
dangerous due to the electromagnetic interferences produced. 
 
Although there are several VLC research projects being 
launched all over the world [2-5], optical wireless 
communication using LED illumination products are still not 
commercially available yet. The phosphor white LED has the 
advantage of low cost, however, one main challenge for 
VLC using LED lighting is to provide high data rate using 
the bandwidth limited phosphor-based LEDs. We have 
measured that its direct modulation frequency response is 
typically 1-2 MHz. The limited response is due to the slow 
time constant of the phosphor. Several approaches have been 
proposed and demonstrated to enhance the frequency 
response, such as using a blue filter at the receiver (Rx) to 
remove the slow yellow light [6], and using equalization 
circuit at the Rx [7]. Spectral efficient advanced modulation 
formats, like discrete multi-tone (DMT) [6] can also be used 
to increase the total data rate.  
 
In addition, there is very little study for the continuity of 
the VLC home network with the outside access network.

Bit-error-rate (BER) was evaluated with and without the 
pre-compensation scheme. Fig. 4 shows the BER curves 
without and with the pre-compensation schemes. For the 
HB-LED without using the pre-compensation scheme 
(typical case), an error floor appears at BER of 10-6. This is 
due to the over-modulation (5 Gb/s) of the HB-LED, which 
only have a 3-dB modulation bandwidth of about 1.28 MHz. 
As a result, we can observe that the eye-opening of the inset 
eye-diagram is small with high inter-symbol interference 
(ISI). When using the pre-compensation scheme, error-free 
(< 10-9) operation can be achieved without observing any 
error-floor. This shows that this simple pre-compensation 
can greatly enhance the frequency response of the LED 
without using complicated pre- and post-equalization circuits 
and advanced modulation formats. 
 
III. CONTINUITY FROM OUTSIDE ACCESS NETWORK 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5. Recent home network using copper cable inside and FTTH 
network outside. 
Access network continuity will play a key role in the 
future networks, and novel methods for managing the 
interconnection of the home network with the outside FTTH 
network are required. Fig. 5 shows the present typical home 
network. A residential gateway (or optical networking unit, 
ONU) is used as the interconnection between the home 
network and the outside FTTH network, e.g. GPON or 
EPON. Inside the home network, copper cables, e.g. 
telephone lines or Ethernet cables, are used to connect the 
computer and high definition television. RF antenna can be 
connected to the residential gateway for home WiFi RF 
wireless connection. 
 
Here, we propose a network prototype that extends the 
outside FTTH access network into the home to make it reach 
the farthest home device and the LED illumination system. 
Different devices will be connected to the home fiber 
network through passive optical splitter, as shown in Fig. 6. 
Using single mode fiber (SMF) to connect different home 
devices could be an ultimate solution for the FTTH since 
SMF has a much higher bandwidth (~50 THz), much lower 
loss (~0.2 dB/km). Besides, the optical-to-electrical and 
electrical-to-optical (OE and EO) conversions in the 
residential gateway can be removed. Recently, our teams has 
successfully demonstrated a direct fiber-to-the-antenna 
(FTTA) system, using SMF to reach the remote antenna unit 
(RAU) inside a building to distributed 2.5 Gb/s ultra-
wideband (UWB) signal [8]. A 300 m reach network 
supporting 1,024 fiber split-ratios was also achieved in this 
FTTA system. This means that the radio-over-fiber (RoF) 
signals can be distributed from the central office to 1,024 
rooms simultaneously inside a building. Similarly, a fiber-to-
the-LED (FTTL) system can be constructed. The proposed 
FTTL optical interface is illustrated in Fig. 7. The optical 
signal (such as the signal described in Section II) carried in 
the SMF is launched into a Rx, in which the converted 
electrical signal is amplified and drive the LED illumination 
system via a bias tee. The LED obtains its bias from the wall 
electrical socket.

outside FTTH with the different home devices.

LED illumination system with the functionality of VLC 
enables the deployment of in-building and home 
communication system with very little extra cost. VLC can 
be used for information broadcast (e.g. multilingual 
interpretation system) in museums and galleries. It is

modeling, analysis and mitigation for wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) 
passive optical networks (PONs) and radio-over-fiber (ROF) networks. Due to 
different limitations of previous RB noise modeling, a novel modeling approach 
that can be easily realized and used efficiently to study the performance of noise 
mitigation has been successfully developed. The various noise contributions are 
derived from the power spectral densities (PSDs) of the optical signals. We 
characterized theoretically (JLT, 26, p.3190, 2008) and experimentally (IEEE PTL, 
19, p.423, 2007) different contributions of the RB in a carrier-distributed PON 
at different optical signal to Rayleigh noise ratios (OSRNRs). Our achievement 
has also been presented in the Post-Deadline Section in the world class conference 
CLEO 2008, USA.  
The achievements of the project have gained international attenuations and the 
project has generated several international invited talks (IEEE LEOS’10 USA；
SPIE Photonics West’09 USA； HSIC’10 Singapore； OECC’09 Hong Kong； OECC’
10 Taiwan) and 2 book chapters (in Optical Access Networks and Advanced Photonics:
