light by photonic crystals is also a potential topic. Therefore, we also adopt the SA algorithms 
to synthesize photonic crystals with low group velocity. For numerical simplicity, we focus 
on the two-dimensional (2D) photonic crystals. 
 
2. Simulated Annealing 
The theory of simulated annealing (SA) stems from the process of freezing liquids or 
cooling down metals and crystallizing into the minimum energy state. The algorithm which is 
generalized from Monte Carlo method and Boltzmann sampling was given by Metropolis et 
al. in the 1950s [7]. It is an efficient method to find the global minimum or maximum of a 
nonlinear optimization problem. Furthermore, Kirkpatrick first made use of the SA on 
designing electronic networks [6] and accordingly the method becomes widely used in the 
VLSI computer aided design. The basic principles of our SA algorithms are briefly described 
in the following. 
 
Before the procedure of optimization by means of the SA, we should choose an initial 
photonic crystal structure, the temperature T (a virtual parameter), and the cost function C, 
which is needed to be minimized. In the first part of our simulation, the PBG is concerned, 
and we let the cost function be a linear combination of PBG and the difference between 
current and target mid-gap frequency. In the second part of our simulation, we plan to 
minimize the group velocity for a certain range of wave vectors, and hence the cost function 
is set to be the average group velocity over the selected wave vectors. The temperature T is a 
function of iteration. During our simulation, we set the temperature profile to be a piecewise 
linearly descending curve. At the beginning, the curve is steep and then the temperature 
decreases rapidly. As the number of iterative steps increases, the slope is more and more 
gentle. We work on a 2-D photonic crystal initial structure with or without an absolute band 
gap (in which neither TE nor TM propagation mode is allowed). Throughout the procedure, 
we deal only with the photonic crystals in a square lattice and keep the structure 
reflection-symmetric with respect to lines x = 0, y = 0 and x = y. For computation, we divide 
the unit cell of the 2-D photonic crystal structure into n n×  rectangular pixels. Each pixel 
contains either air (with dielectric constant of unity) or dielectric (with dielectric constant dε , 
which can be adjusted). Then we compute the absolute PBG by the fast plane wave expansion 
method. In the 2D Brillouin Zone, we select 30 wave vectors which are distributed uniformly 
along Γ  point to X point, X point to M point, and M point to Γ  point. Then we compute 
the eigenfrequencies according to each wave vector to get the band structure. 
  
In our SA simulation, there are three sequential stages for changing photonic crystal 
structure at each iterative step. First, we randomly exchange a dielectric pixel and an air pixel. 
We compute the band structure and the new cost function to decide whether we keep the 
change or not. If the new cost is lower (i.e., 0C∆ < ), we undoubtedly accept the new 
structure. On the contrary, if the cost is higher ( 0C∆ > ), we accept the worse result when 
exp( / )C T−∆  is greater than a computer-generalized random number between 0 and 1. In 
other words, there is some probability that we will accept the worse result to avoid being 
trapped in the local minimum. Therefore, we will reject the change if the cost rises and the 
above judgment is not satisfied. Second, we change the filling factor of the dielectric by 
randomly replacing a pixel by the alternative material. Here the filling factor is defined as the 
ratio of the area occupied by the dielectric to the area of the unit cell. That is, we replace a 
dielectric pixel by an air pixel or vice versa. Again, we use the aforementioned selection rule

synthesized some photonic crystals with low group velocity by using simulated annealing. It 
has been found that the group velocity of the modes in the 1st band is difficult to be reduced 
by simply modifying the structure. Therefore, our work is focused on the 2nd band. Our 
simulation results can be helpful to the design of photonic crystals.
