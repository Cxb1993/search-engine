Abstract—Multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency-
division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) is a promising modulation 
scheme for high performance broadband wireless 
communications. However, one major drawback of MIMO-
OFDM is the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the 
output signals. Latinović et al. [1] proposed a PAPR reduction 
method termed polyphase interleaving and inversion (PII) for 
MIMO-OFDM systems under the use of the space-frequency 
block coding (SFBC). In this paper, we find more degrees of 
freedom can be utilized among the multiple antennas for the 
SFBC MIMO-OFDM systems. Hence, we present four additional 
cross-antenna SFBC patterns, and based on these patterns, we 
propose two new efficient PAPR reduction schemes for SFBC 
MIMO-OFDM systems. The simulation results show that, even 
with the same computational complexity, the proposed scheme 
would have better PAPR reduction performance than the PII 
method.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency-
division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) has gained a lot 
attention for high performance broadband wireless 
communications. Like OFDM, MIMO-OFDM has a major 
disadvantage of high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of 
the output signals. Many solutions are proposed to reduce the 
high PAPR of the MIMO-OFDM systems; some of them focus 
on the space-time block coded (STBC) MIMO-OFDM systems 
[2]-[4], and some papers focus on the space-frequency block 
coded (SFBC) MIMO-OFDM systems [1], [5]. SFBC MIMO-
OFDM is a more appropriate transmission scheme for 
multipath time-variant fading channels. Latinović et al. [1] 
proposed a PAPR reduction method termed polyphase 
interleaving and inversion (PII) for MIMO-OFDM systems 
under the use of SFBC. In this paper, we find more degrees of 
freedom can be utilized among the multiple antennas for the 
SFBC MIMO-OFDM systems. Hence, we present four 
additional cross-antenna SFBC patterns, and based on these 
patterns, we propose two new efficient PAPR reduction 
schemes for SFBC MIMO-OFDM systems. The simulation 
results show that, even with the same computational 
complexity, the proposed scheme would have better PAPR 
reduction performance than the PII method. 
II. SYSTEM MODEL 
In order to simplify the descriptions of our proposed 
method, we consider a SFBC MIMO-OFDM system with 2 
transmit and 1 receive antennas. For other systems with more 
transmit antennas, the proposed method can be easily extended. 
In the SFBC MIMO-OFDM system, a block of N data 
symbols, represented as a vector ] ,, ,[ 110 -= NXXX KX , is 
first encoded by space-frequency Alamouti scheme [6] to 
produce two vectors

According to these two vectors, the antennas of the SFBC 
MIMO-OFDM system transmit OFDM signals with N 
subcarriers modulated by the elements of X1 and X2. These two 
transmit signals can be expressed as

where Xi,n is the nth element of the vector Xi, Df is the 
frequency difference between subcarriers, and T is the OFDM 
symbol duration.  
Similar to OFDM systems, SFBC MIMO-OFDM systems 
also have a major disadvantage of high PAPR of the output 
signals x1(t) and x2(t). The PAPR of the transmit signal at ith 
antenna is defined as
