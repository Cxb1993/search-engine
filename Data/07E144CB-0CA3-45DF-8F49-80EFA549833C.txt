are present.  We have prepared highly luminescent dendron-substituted copolyfluorenes that 
incorporate surface-modified cadmium sulfide nanoparticles.  A small percentage of these 
nanoparticles can be incorporated into the dendritic structures upon tailoring the interfaces 
between the ligands on the nanoparticles and the dendritic structures in the copolyfluorene.  
Both the photoluminescence and electroluminescence efficiencies of the polymer 
nanocomposites are dramatically enhanced.    Moreover, in order to know the effect to some 
other nanoparticles, we have tethered gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) to the side chains of 
poly{2,7-(9,9´-dioctylfluorene)-co- 4-diphenylamino-4´- bipenylmethylsulfide} (PF-DBMS) 
through its ArSCH3 anchor groups. The presence of 1 wt% of the tethered gold NPs led to a 
reduction in the degree of aggregation of the polymer chains, resulting in a 50% increase in its 
quantum yield. The electroluminescence of a 1wt% Au/ PF-DBMS device was three times higher 
in terms of its maximum brightness and its full-width-at-half-maximum emission peak was much 
narrower than that of a pure PF-DBMS device. These phenomena arise from the photooxidation 
suppression, hole blocking, and electron transport enhancing effects of the Au NPs were also 
demonstrated in Chapter 5.

shown in Figure 4. When the two electrodes are connected electrons are injected from the 
cathode into the p* -band semiconducting polymer and holes are injected from an electrode into

1-2 Research Motivation  
 
1-2-1. The Original of Green Emission in Polyfluorene-based Conjugated Polymers: 
On-Chain defect Fluorescence. 
Conjugated polymers have been studied in great detail as electroluminescent materials for 
use in organic light emitting diodes. Significant progress has been made in understanding the 
fundamental working processes involved in generating efficient, reliable light across the entire 
visible spectrum. Polyfluorene-based materials have been investigated extensively because of the 
many attractive properties they possess. Additional experimental results are needed to discern the 
nature of the unwanted green emission that often appears during device operation and quantum 
efficiencies need to be significantly improved. The currently most challenging topic for 
conjugated polymers applications is blue emission color stability. All available 
poly(para-phenylene) (PP)-type materials, which are the most promising family of blue light 
emitters, are prone to degradation, resulting in an unwanted change in color due to the emergence 
of low energy green emission peak. However, vital to overcome the problem and to provide 
sutible future synthetic stragies. The low-energy emission band has been mostly attributed to 
recordering of the polymer chains and subsequent aggregate[4] or excimer formation.[5]  It will 
be shown in the following that both excimer and aggregate formation cannot explain the 
presented experimental observations and can therefore be ruled out as the main origins of the 
nanoparticles into a PPV derivative enhances the PLED current density and radiance by an order 
of magnitude. In this thesis, we have to improve or tailor material properties with composite and 
develop finely tailored nanocomposite materials for emissive or non emissive display technology.   
An efficient way to obtain promising new materials is to modify existing potential materials with 
doping of semiconductor nanoparticles are described. 
 
 
1-3  Materials 
 
1-3-1. Polyfluorene (PF) 
Fluorene is a polycyclic aromatic compound, which received its name due to strong violet 
fluorescence which arises from highly conjugated planar π-electron system. The 2,7-Positions in 
fluorene are the most reactive sites towards electrophilic attack, which allows construction of a 
fully conjugated rigid-rod polymer chain by substitution reactions, whereas the methylene bridge 
provides an opportunity to modify the processability of the polymer by substituents, without 
perturbing the electronic structure of the backbone. The varieties, excellent optical and electronic 
properties, and high thermal and chemical stability of polyfluorenes (PFs) make them an 
attractive class of materials for polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs). Different aspects of 
syntheses, properties and LED applications of fluorene-based conjugated polymers and 
co-polymers have been highlighted in several recent reviews. [11]   In fact, polyfluorenes are the 
only class of conjugated polymers that can emit a whole range of visible colors with relatively 
high quantum efficiency. 
 
It is well known that PFs are the most promising class of blue-emitting materials. The 
original problem associated with undesirable “green emission band” was shown to be a result of 
exciton trapping on the electron deficient fluorenone defect sites. The color purity can be

6. Non-ionic route (Gilch modification) 
7. Knoevenagel polycondensation 
8. Heck coupling polymerization 
9. Wittig(-Horner) Condensation 
10. Miscellaneous. 
Being a relatively good electron donor, PPV and its derivatives can be chemically doped by 
strong oxidating agents and strong acids, affording highly conductive p-doped materials (with 
conductivity up to ~104 S/cm5). The yellow-green fluorescence of PPV is featured by a 
vibronically structured emission band with peaks maxima at 520 and 551 nm (Figure 2b).      
 
1-3-3. Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxanes (POSS) 
Organic-inorganic nanocomposites with well-defined architectures have attracted a great deal 
of attention since they not only have synergistic properties, but can also be tailored to specific 
technical applications[14]. One class of inorganic component- polyhedral oligomeric 
silsesquioxanes (POSS) has nanometer-sized structure with high surface area and controlled 
porosity has been demonstrated to an efficient method in the design of hybrid materials[15-27].  
POSS has two unique features : (1) the chemical composition is a hybrid, intermediate (RSiO1.5) 
between that of silica (SiO2) and silicones (R2SiO). (2) POSS molecules are physically large,  
POSS consists of a rigid, cubic silica core with a 0.53 nanometer side length and can have 
organic functional groups connected to the vertices of the cubic core for further reaction (Figure 
7). Due to its versatile functional groups and high solubility in several solvents, POSS molecules 
can form covalent bonds with themselves or organic monomers.  POSS molecules are typically 
due to the roughening of the surface onto which the Al cathode is deposited and to balanced 
charge injection. 
On the other hand, in polymer-nanoparticle composites, uniform dispersion of the nanoparticles 
carries advantages over cases where nanoparticle aggregation dominates. Such dispersion has 
been particularly difficult to obtain in the case of composites prepared from nanoparticles and 
conjugated polymers. One recent study found that cadmium selenide nanocrystals, or quantum 
dots, can be integrated into thin films of poly( paraphenylene vinylene) (PPV) without 
aggregation. [29] (Figure 8)  The ability to tailor and disperse quantum dots in PPV thin films in 
this fashion dramatically impacts the photophysical properties of these materials relative to 
conventional blends. While PPV coverage is emphasized here, the novel quantum dot growth 
methods, and the general polymerization methodology, carry the potential for broad applicability 
that will enable new physical studies and device fabrication using polymer-quantum dot 
composite materials.

CHEM. SOC. 2004, 126, 11322) 
The first such study was undertaken by attaching POSS covalently to the chain ends of 
poly(2-methoxy-5-[2-ethylhexyloxy]-1,4-phenylenevinylene) (MEHPPV) and 
poly(9,9´-dioctylfluorene) (PFO), which resulted in enhanced thermal stability of the devices 
prepared from these modified polymers.[45]  The density of the polymer chain ends, however, 
decreases as the molecular weight of the polymer increases, which limits the amount of POSS 
that can be attached (ca. 1.2%). Another study involved a synthesis of a bridged polyfluorene 
copolymer by using fluorene tetrabromide monomers featuring a siloxane bridge.  The thermal 
stability of a device made from this siloxane-bridged polyfluorene appears to be better than that 
prepared from pure PFO. [48]  A third related study involved attaching polyfluorene to the 
functionalized vertices on the cubic polyhedral silsesquioxane core units to form starlike 
structures; these polymers possessed improved thermal and optoelectronic characteristics. The 
amount of POSS content in the polyfluorene was ca. 3.8%. [48]  The enhanced 
electroluminescence characteristics in these polyfluorenes have been attributed to POSS 
imparting a reduction in either the degree of aggregation and excimer formation or the number of 
keto defects. The molecular architecture that polyfluorene possessed in the latter two studies 
cannot be defined easily. Previously, we synthesized a polyimide-side-chain 
-tethered POSS as an approach to lowering its dielectric constant. [49a]  In this present study, we 
took a copolymer approach by synthesizing polyfluorene-tethered POSS in a well-defined 
architecture. To the best of our knowledge, the introduction of an inorganic side group, such as 
POSS, into the C-9 position of polyfluorene has not been explored previously. We believe that 
by developing a POSS/polyfluorene copolymer having well-defined architecture we will be able 
to tailor its luminescence properties more precisely by modifying the molecular structure.  In 
this paper, we report the synthesis and characterization of fluorene-based random copolymers 
featuring tethered polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) units.

2-2-3. Device Fabrication and Testing.   
The electroluminescent (EL) devices were fabricated on an ITO-coated glass substrate that was 
precleaned and then treated with oxygen plasma before use. A layer of poly(ethylene 
dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron P from Bayer Co.; ca. 40-nm 
thick) was formed by spin-coating from its aqueous solution (1.3 wt%).  The EL layer was 
spin-coated at 1500 rpm from the corresponding toluene solution (15 mg mL–1) on top of the 
vacuum-dried PEDOT:PSS layer. The nominal thickness of the EL layer was 65 nm. Using a 
base pressure below 1 × 10–6 Torr, a layer of Ca (30 nm) was vacuum deposited as the cathode 
and a thick layer of Al was deposited subsequently as the protecting layer. The current–voltage 
characteristics were measured using a Hewlett–Packard 4155B semiconductor parameter 
analyzer. The power of the EL emission was measured using a Newport 2835-C multi-function 
optical meter. The brightness was calculated using the forward output power and the EL spectra 
of the devices; a Lambertian distribution of the EL emission was assumed. 
 
2-3  Results and Discussions 
A. Polyphenylenevinylene Copolymer Presenting Side-Chain-Tethered Silsesquioxane Units 
Nanocomposites  
Figure 1 displays the 1H NMR spectra of 9,9´-bis(4-aminophenyl)-2,7-dibromo -fluorene 
(3), Cl-POSS, and D-POSS-diAF (4).  The peak for the NH protons shifted downfield from 
3.59 ppm for 3 to 4.48 ppm for 4, while the CH2 peak of Cl-POSS shifted upfield from 4.47 to 
4.21 ppm in D-POSS-diAF. The ratio of the peak areas of the benzylic CH2 and NH protons is ca.  
wavelengths of the absorption and PL maxima and the quantum yields of PFO-POSS.  The 
absorption and emission peak maxima of PFO occur at 384 and 418 nm, respectively; these 
values are close to those reported in the literature. [55]  We observed no aggregation band in 
these spectra because THF is a good solvent for PFO. The absortion and emission peaks for PFO 
and PFO-POSS are almost identical. For each polymer, the absorption peak maximum in 
solution (THF) is located between 384 and 362 nm, with a slight blue shift caused by the 
presence of POSS; the PL maxima occur at similar wavelengths for all of the polymers. The 
quantum yields of the PFO-POSS copolymers increased substantially as the amount of tethered 
POSS increased. In particular, the quantum yield of PFO containing 10% POSS was 54% higher 
than that of pure PFO (0.86 vs. 0.55). This finding can be attributed to the steric hindrance 
caused by the POSS units preventing aggregation of the PFO main chains, which, in turn, 
reduces the degree of dimer formation after excitation.  This phenomenon is a result of the 
particular side-chain-tethered POSS architecture that we have employed: it has not been reported 
in previous studies of POSS/PFO copolymers. The other significant effect that the incorporation 
of the silsesquioxane into PFO side chain causes is the persistence of luminescence behaviour 
after thermal treatment of PFO-POSS. The stability of both color and luminescence at elevated 
temperatures are critical for polymer LEDs because sometimes the operating temperature of 
these devices exceeds 86 °C. Next, we investigated in detail the effect that thermal treatment has 
on POSS-incorporated PFO. Figure 4a displays the photoluminescence spectra of PFO as a solid 
film after heat treatment at 200 °C; in all cases, the absorption peaks at 386 nm remain. Other 
than the main peak at 425 nm, we observe an additional small peak, at ca. 530 nm, in the 
spectrum of PFO film exposed at 200 °C for 1 h. The green emission peak at 530 nm increased 
in intensity, while the intensity of the main 425 nm peak reduced quite dramatically, after 
annealing the PFO film for 2 h. Figure 4b indicates that, after thermal treatment, the intensity of 
the keto peak (C=O, 1713 cm-1) in the FTIR spectra decreases as the amount of POSS in PFO 
increases: almost no keto peak appears in the spectrum of the sample containing 10% POSS.  
where 10% POSS was incorporated in PFO, the green emission in the range 470–600 nm was 
reduced sharply, while the peak at 425 nm became the major emission peak and had an intensity 
much larger than that exhibited by the device prepared from pure PFO. The reduction in the 
green emission is apparently due to the presence of the siloxane units. The introduction of bulky 
siloxane units into polyfluorene side chain presumably serves a dual function; it not only hinders 
oxidation of fluorenes but also increases the interchain distance, thereby retarding the interchain 
interactions and leading to a reduction of excitons migration to defect sites as discussed in a 
previous study. [56]   Figure 8 displays the variations of the current density and brightness of the 
EL devices. The turn-on voltage increased to 5.8 V for PFO containing 10% POSS from 5.4 V 
for the pure-PFO EL device. A significant increase (68%) in the maximum brightness of the 
PFO-POSS-10%-based device occurred relative to that of the pure-PFO EL device (392 vs. 234 
cd/m2) at a drive voltage of 10 V and a current density of 576 mA/cm2. These improvements 
might be due to a combination of a lesser degree of aggregation and fewer keto defects being 
formed upon the incorporation of POSS into PFO. 
2-4  Conclusions 
We have synthesized a novel polyfluorene side-chain-tethered polyhedral silsesquioxane 
that has a well-defined architecture. This particular molecular architecture of PFO-POSS 
increases the quantum yield of polyfluorene significantly by reducing the degree of interchain 
aggregation; it also results in a purer and stronger blue light being emitted from the EL device by 
preventing the formation of keto defects.

Enhanced Luminance and Thermal Properties of Polyphenylenevinylene 
Copolymer Presenting Side-Chain-Tethered Silsesquioxane Units  
3-1  Introduction Materials 
Emissive media based on electroluminescent (EL) polymers are currently under 
development for a number of display applications, [27, 57, 58] including large-area flat-panel 
displays that can be driven at low voltage. Polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) are very 
promising candidates for the development of low-cost, multicolored, large-area flat-panel 
displays because their molecular structures are readily modified and because they can be handled 
using a range of wet processing techniques. [59-60]  A number of issues remain to be resolved, 
however, before commercialization of these devices can occur. The formation of excimers 
resulting from the aggregation of their molecular chains in the solid state, and rather short 
operating lifetimes, owing to their low thermal stabilities. Several attempts have been made to 
reduce the formation of aggregates of polymer chains in the solid state. One such approach is the 
introduction of bulky organic units into the side chains of the polymer. This tactic has been used, 
for example, in the case of poly(p-phenylenevinylene) (PPV)-based alternating copolymers 
containing conjugated phenylenevinylene segments and nonconjugated spacers; [61-63] these 
bulky side groups disrupt the packing of the polymer chains, which results in the formation of 
amorphous PPVs displaying reduced aggregation. Another approach to improving the efficiency 
of the devices is to blend hole-transporting and electron-transporting materials to balance the 
injected charges. [64-66a] When such a device is operated for a long time, however, this method 
can cause some defect to occur in some cases. [66b-d] When such a device is operated for a long 
time, however, this method can cause some phase separation to occur, which is detrimental to 
the device’s performance. Other approaches include improving the antioxidative properties of 
the pendant groups or chain ends[67] and limiting chain mobility by blending[52] with a high-Tg 
that developing POSS/poly(p-phenylene vinylene) copolymers having well-defined architectures 
will allow its luminescence properties to be tailored more precisely through modifications of its 
molecular structure. 
 
3-2  Experimental Section 
3-2-1. Materials 
Chlorobenzylcyclopentyl-POSS[70a] was synthesized according to literature procedures.  
THF was distilled under nitrogen from sodium benzophenone ketyl; other solvents were dried 
using standard procedures. All other reagents were used as received from commercial sources, 
unless otherwise stated. 
 
Chlorobenzylcyclopentyl-POSS.  1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3):   7.64 (d,　  J = 8.1 Hz, 2H), 
7.37 (d, J = 8.1 Hz, 2H), 4.57 (s, 2H), 2.26–1.21 (m, 56H), 1.16–0.81 (m, 7H) ppm.  29Si NMR 
(600 MHz, THF): –67.8, –68.2, –79.6 ppm. 
 
Synthesis of POSS-CH3 (1). 2,5-Dimethylphenol (238 mg, 1.95 mmol) was stirred with K2CO3 
(4.58 g, 33.18 mmol) and KI (1.57 g, 9.48 mmol) in DMF (30 mL) and THF (15 mL) at room 
temperature for 1 h.  A small amount of Cl-POSS (2.0 g, 1.95 mmol) was added and then the 
whole mixture was heated at 70 °C for 3 h. The reaction mixture was then slowly poured into 
water (300 mL) and extracted with chloroform (3 × 50 mL). The combined extracts were dried 
(MgSO4), the solvents were evaporated, and the residue was purified by column chromatography 
(hexane/ chloroform, 1:10) to afford 1 (1.86 g, 81%).  1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3): δ 7.70 (d, J 
= 8.1Hz, 2H), 7.51–7.31 (b, 3H), 7.03 (d, J = 6.9 Hz, 1H), 6.67 (s, 1H), 5.09 (s, 2H), 2.37 (s, 3H), 
2.32 (s, 3H), 2.27–1.21 (m, 56H), 1.17–0.81 (m, 7H) ppm.  
 
 
the synthesized materials were acquired using a Nicolet 360 FT-IR spectrometer.  Gel 
permeation chromatographic analyses were performed on a Waters 410 Differential 
Refractometer and a Waters 600 controller (Waters Styragel Column). All GPC analyses of 
polymers in THF solutions were performed at a flow rate of 1 mL/min at 40 °C; the samples 
were calibrated using polystyrene standards. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential 
scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere at 
heating rates of 20 and 10 °C/min, respectively, using Du Pont TGA-2950 and TA-2000 
instruments, respectively. UV–Vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were 
recorded on a HP 8453 spectrophotometer and a Hitachi F-4500 luminescence spectrometer, 
respectively. Before investigating the thermal stability of the synthesized polymers, their 
polymer films were annealed in air at 200 °C for 2 h. 
 
3-2-3. Device Fabrication and Testing.   
The electroluminescent (EL) devices were fabricated on an ITO-coated glass substrate that 
was precleaned and then treated with oxygen plasma before use. A layer of poly(ethylene 
dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron P from Bayer Co.; ca. 40-nm 
thick) was formed by spin-coating it from an aqueous solution (1.3 wt%).  The EL layer was 
spin-coated, at 1500 rpm from the corresponding toluene solution (15 mg mL–1), on top of the 
vacuum-dried PEDOT:PSS layer. The nominal thickness of the EL layer was 65 nm.  Using a 
base pressure below 1 × 10–6 Torr, a layer of Ca (35 nm) was vacuum deposited as the cathode 
and a thick layer of Al was deposited subsequently as the protecting layer. The current–voltage 
characteristics were measured using a Hewlett–Packard 4155B semiconductor parameter 
analyzer. The power of the EL emission was measured using a Newport 2835-C multi-function 
optical meter. The brightness was calculated using the forward output power and the EL spectra 
of the devices; a Lambertian distribution of the EL emission was assumed. 
 
presence of POSS; the PL maxima occur at similar wavelengths for all of the polymers. Figure 
3A presents the normalized absorption and PL emission spectra of the MEHPPV-POSS 
copolymer films. The quantum yields of the POSS-PPV-co-MEHPPV copolymers increased 
substantially as the amount of tethered POSS increased. [80] In particular, the quantum yield of 
MEHPPV containing 10% POSS was four times higher than that of pure MEHPPV (0.87 vs. 
0.19). We attribute this finding to the steric hindrance caused by the POSS units in preventing 
aggregation of the PPV main chains, which, in turn, reduces the degree of dimer formation after 
excitation. This improved quantum yield, which has not been reported in any previous studies of 
POSS/PPV copolymers, is a direct result of employing this particular side-chain-tethered POSS 
architecture.  
 
For fresh MEH-PPV film, the yellowish peak at ~590 nm originates from single chain 
exciton emissions, [76] whereas the reddish peak at 630 nm is related to emissions from interchain 
species, such as aggregates or excimers. [76a] The difference in the PL spectra of the fresh 
MEH-PPV and POSSPPV-co-MEHPPV film is small because both polymer chains have not 
reached equilibrium states by their preparation process (i.e. spin-coating). By annealing the 
polymer films at higher temperatures as in the work by Schwartz [77] and Yang Yang [78] et al., 
one could see some more profound changes in their PL spectra. For instance, Figure 3B shows 
that after annealing MEHPPV film at 150oC for 2 h under air, its PL spectrum displays a 
red-shifted broad main peak at 630 nm, indicating formation of aggregates. While the main 
emission peak for annealed POSS-PPV10-co-MEHPPV film remain near 590 nm, with a weak 
peak at 630 nm. Therefore, at the equilibrium states, there is a distinct difference in their PL 
spectra, due to the bulky and rigid POSS groups tethered to the side of MEHPPV chains.  The 
same phenomena are also observed in EL spectra (Figure 5).  
 
We have carried out by X-ray diffraction for confirming that interchain distance of PPV was 
the range 610–620 nm, which is due presumably to the aggregation of MEHPPV and its excimer 
formation, as discussed earlier. The introduction of bulky siloxane units into the PPV side chains 
presumably increases the interchain distance, thereby retarding interchain interactions and 
leading to a reduction in the degree of exciton migration to defect sites.[62]  Figure 6 displays the 
variations in the current density and brightness of the EL devices. The turn-on voltage decreased 
to 2.5 V for PPV containing 10% POSS from 3.5 V for the pure-MEHPPV EL device.  As 
indicated in Figure 6, a more than four-fold increase occurred in the maximum brightness of the 
POSS-PPV10-co-MEHPPV-based device relative to that of the pure-MEHPPV EL device (2196 
vs. 473 cd/m2) at a drive voltage of 9.5 V.   The efficiency of POSS-PPV10-co-MEHPPV is 
1.83 cd/A at a current density of 1221 A/m2. 
These improvements might be due to a decreased degree of aggregation upon the incorporation 
of the POSS units into the PPV chains. 
 
3-4  Conclusions 
We have synthesized a novel poly(p-phenylenevinylene) side-chain-tethered polyhedral 
silsesquioxane (POSS-PPV-co-MEHPPV) that possesses a well-defined architecture. This 
particular molecular architecture of PPV-POSS increases the quantum yield of MEHPPV 
significantly by reducing the degree of interchain aggregation; it also results in a much brighter 
red light from the EL device by decreasing the degree of aggregation between the polymer 
chains.

Thiophenol-modified CdS nanoparticles enhance the luminescence of 
benzoxyl dendron-substituted polyfluorene copolymers 
4-1  Introduction 
Conjugated aromatic polymers have attracted a considerable amount of interest over the past 
few decades because their semiconducting and electroactive properties allow them to be used in 
a diverse range of applications, such as in batteries, electronic devices, and light-emitting diodes.  
In particular, the development of blue light-emitting polymers remains critical to the fabrication 
of full-color organic displays. Polyfluorene[82–84] layers have emerged as potential sources of blue 
light for light-emitting diodes because of their relatively high photoluminescence efficiencies. [85]  
Indeed, their photo- and thermostabilities are better than those of poly(phenylene vinylene) 
derivatives. [86–90] Although these polymers exhibit relatively high photoluminescence quantum 
efficiencies and good thermal stabilities, their device applications are hampered by their 
tendency to form aggregates in the solid state. Moreover, most organic chromophores, such as 
those in polymers, quench to different degrees at various concentrations in the solid state, and 
this phenomenon leads to broad emission bands and losses in efficiency and purity of color.  
Attempts at improving the luminescence efficiency of polymers have followed two approaches: 
steric hindrance approach and the electronic approach. The steric hindrance approach involves 
altering the interchain distance between polymers by attaching bulky side groups—e.g., dendritic 
structures—to the main chain of the polymer; such modifications prevent aggregate formation or 
concentration quenching. The luminescence efficiencies in these copolymers have been 
improved in several cases, but this phenomenon occurs in conjunction with a decrease in the 
molecular weight of the polymers, owing to synthetic yield constraints. The electronic approach 
involves combining materials having higher quantum yields into luminescent polymers. [91]  For 
example, one method combines conjugated organic polymers with wide-band-gap semiconductor 
synthesized CdS can be adjusted by changing the ratio of the three ingredients. These CdS 
nanoparticles are termed “S-CdS” nanoparticles, indicating that the surface ligands on the CdS 
nanoparticles are thiophenol units. After filtration, the S-CdS nanoparticles were collected and 
then dispersed in DMF. From the absorption edge (λe) in their UV–Vis spectra, the S-CdS 
nanoparticles were determined to have diameters of ca. 3, 4, and 7 nm. [108–109] 
The synthesis of the dendritic polyfluorene was performed using a typical Suzuki coupling 
reaction protocol. The copolymerization of dendritic monomers and 2,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl 
-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-9,9-dioctylfluorene was performed using Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst and 
Aliquat 336 as a phase-transfer reagent in a mixture of toluene and aqueous potassium carbonate 
(2.0 M). A detailed description of the synthesis of these dendritic copolyfluorenes is available to 
elsewhere. [102, 8]  The copolymers were named PF-GX, where X represents the number of 
generations of the dendron (X = 0, 1, or 2). S-CdS/DMF was added to a previously prepared 
dendritic copolyfluorene PF-GX (X = 0, 1, 2) in DMF solution and stirred overnight. PF-G1, the 
polyfluorene possessing one dendron generation, had a weight-average molecular weight (Mw) 
of 65 kDa and a polydispersity of 1.9; PF-G2, the polyfluorene having two dendron generations, 
had a Mw of 40 kDa and a polydispersity of 2.2. The mixture of S-CdS/PF-GX in DMF was 
dried under vacuum at 313 K for 2 h and then maintained at 383 K for another 24 h to obtain the 
S-CdS/PF-GX nanocomposite film. Scheme 1 outlines the synthesis of the nanocomposites 
formed from the thiophenol-modified CdS nanoparticles and the dendritic copolyfluorenes. 
 
4-3   Results and Discussion 
A. Polyfluorene Side-Chain-Tethered CdS Nanoparticles 
Figure 1 displays the UV–Vis absorption spectra of three differently sized thiophenol 
-modified CdS (S-CdS) nanoparticles in DMF. The sharp absorption peak at λ = 269 nm is due to 
the benzene ring in the thiophenol and the broad absorption peaks at λ = 360, 410, and 460 nm 
arise from CdS nanoparticles having diameters of 3, 4, and 7 nm, respectively.  The maximum 
intensities of these peaks are affected dramatically by the amount and size of the incorporated 
S-CdS. For instance, in Figure 3a we observe that when 4 wt% of S-CdS3nm nanoparticles are 
added to PF-G1, the intensity of the PL peak at 425 nm increased by more than 2.5 times relative 
to that of pure PF-G1. This effect becomes more pronounced as the size of CdS nanoparticles 
increases, as illustrated in Figures 3b and 3c. The intensities of the peaks at 425 nm of the PF-G1 
thin films incorporating 4- and 7-nm-diameter CdS nanoparticles increased by 3.1 and 3.4 times, 
respectively, relative to that of pure PF-G1. We did not observe any peaks between 500 and 700 
nm for S-CdS nanoparticles present in PF-G1, presumably due to the low S-CdS concentration 
that we used. The intensity of the PL peak at 425 nm in 4 wt% S-CdS7nm/PF-G2 was more than 3 
times that of pure PF-G2, with no appearance of the CdS PL peak (see the supporting 
information). To fully understand this behavior, we performed two control experiments. The first 
considered the light emission of the S-CdS nanoparticles; the second was concerned with 
whether other luminescent polymers lacking dendritic structures behave in a similar manner. 
Figure 4 illustrates that no detectable PL peaks appeared when the same amount (4 wt %) of 
S-CdS was present in optically inactive poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). Moreover, the 
addition of the same amount of S-CdS nanoparticles into PF-G0 and MEH-PPV did not 
substantially change the intensities or locations of the PL peaks of these polymers. This finding 
indicates that the CdS nanoparticles themselves emit relatively weak light in the nanocomposites, 
if at all. What is more interesting, however, is the role that CdS plays in the PL enhancement of 
the dendritic polymers. There are two possible mechanisms through which CdS nanoparticles 
enhance the PL of copolyfluorene, i.e., through steric hindrance or through electronic phenomena. 
The first of these mechanisms proposes that an increase in the inter-polymer chain distance in the 
nanocomposites leads to a decrease in dimer formation.  In the pure PF-G1 polymer, dimers 
form as a result of the close proximity of polymer chains when they are excited. The 
inter-polymer chain distances in the S-CdS/PF-GX (X = 1, 2) nanocomposites increases upon 
incorporating the S-CdS nanoparticles into the dendritic polymers. Figure 5A shows X-ray 
and the dendritic units in PF-G1. The interactions between aromatic rings via π-stacking (i.e. the 
van der Waals contact between aromatic ring) [114] are at the origin of many phenomena of 
organic material science[113] and biological chemistry,[115] and can be determined by the oxidation 
potential of the material during electron detachment. Another piece of supporting evidence of 
CdS nanoparticles bound to the dendrons can therefore be found in the oxidation potential 
change, when the π-stacking of thiophenol surfactant on CdS with the phenyl groups in the 
dendron structure occurs. The inset in Figure 5D shows that the oxidation potential (Eox) of 
S-CdS/PF-G1 decrease with the increasing amount of CdS.[116]  For example, in the presence 8 
wt % CdS4nm nanoparticles, the Eox reduced to 1.24V from 1.30V for pure PF-G1. Although this 
change is small, it is enough to reflect the fact that there exists a possibility that π-π stacking 
formed to some extent[115, 117] since the volume percentage of CdS in PF-G1 is one fourth of the 
weight percentage (density of CdS vs. PF-G1 is close to 4:1).  By combining the FTIR, 
oxidation potential, and X-ray diffraction results, it can reasonably be concluded that the 
incorporation of S-CdS nanoparticles into the dendritic polyfluorene chains have happened, and 
that leads to increased distance between polymer chains. This phenomenon implies that the free 
volume in the nanocomposites is larger than that of the pure polymer because the inter-polymer 
chain distance is a one-dimensional representation of the free volume. The glass transition 
temperatures (Tg) of the S-CdS/copolyfluorene nanocomposites at various compositions are 
summarized. (see the supporting information). Our hypothesis is supported by the fact that the 
value of Tg for 8 wt% S-CdS/PF-G1 is depressed to 74.3 °C from 90.5 °C for pure PF-G1. We 
also found that the values of Tg decreased upon increasing the diameter of the S-CdS 
nanoparticles. The depression is also apparent in the case of the PF-G2 nanocomposites (from 
59.1 for pure PF-G2 to 54.3 °C); the low value of Tg of PF-G2, relative to that of PF-G1, is due 
to the presence of a greater number of chain ends in the second-generation dendron. Figure 6 
displays transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of 4 wt% S-CdS/PF-G1; it is clear that 
the S-CdS nanoparticles did not form large aggregates in the PF-G1 matrix. The other possible 
B. Electroluminescence (EL) Characteristics 
We fabricated double-layer LED devices having the configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/ 
polymer/Ca/Al, where PEDOT:PSS [poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with 
poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (Batron-P 4083)] was used as the hole injection/transporting layer at a 
thickness of 150 nm. A thin layer of Ca (35 nm) was employed as the cathode, which was coated 
with a 180-nm-thick layer of Al. The thickness of the emissive layer was ca. 80 nm.  Figure 7 
displays the normalized electroluminescence of the devices. The similarities between the EL and 
PL spectra of both the pure PF-G1 and S-CdS/PF-G1 devices indicate that the same excitation 
processes occur in each case. The EL device prepared from pure PF-G1 emits blue light at 426 
nm and a weak green light in the range 465–550 nm. In the case where 8% S-CdS was 
incorporated into PF-G1, the green emission in the range 465–550 nm reduced sharply, while the 
peak at 426 nm became a sharper and major emission peak. In addition, the full width at the 
half-maximum (FWHM) of the peak of 8% S-CdS/PF-G1 reduced to 49 nm from a value of 112 
nm for pure PF-G1, indicating that it emits a purer blue light. Compared with its PL spectrum, 
the change in relative intensities in vibronic structure indicates that aggregate emission is 
dominant in its EL process. [104–105]  This behavior has also been observed in polyfluorene 
derivatives, namely for PF-POSS. [105]  Figure 8 displays the variations of the current density 
and brightness of the EL devices. The turn-on voltage increased to 4.5 V for PF-G1 containing 
8% S-CdS from 4 V for the pure-PF-G1 EL device. A more-than-fourfold increase in the 
maximum brightness of the 8% CdS/PF-G1-based device occurred relative to that of the 
pure-PF-G1 EL device (1196 vs. 298 cd/m2) at a drive voltage of 10 V and a current density of 
644 mA/cm2. These improvements are probably due to the lower degree of aggregation that 
occurred upon incorporating S-CdS into PF-G1.
