ABSTRACT 
For more than ten years, the principal investigator has been devoted to the research on 
physiological and mental/conscious phenomena under Chan meditation. A number of 
important results have been reported, of which we mainly focus on investigating the EEG 
(electroencephalograph) characteristics based on the scientific approach. Subjects of the 
experiment practice the Chan Buddhism. From a large amount of meditation EEG signals 
acquired, we characterized their temporal and spectral features by a number of advanced DSP 
methodologies. Some particular findings aroused our attention of further exploring the spatial 
 4
constructing the EEG mapping [16-22]. According to our study on Chan-meditation EEG 
during the past ten years, a number of EEG characteristics have been found to be evidently 
linked to the Chan-meditation practice. We have reported our findings on frontal alpha 
activity and beta-dominated phenomena, mainly from the temporal and spectral aspects. In 
this study, we particularly focused on EEG spatial properties during meditation. 
I.1 Motivation 
Studies of meditation EEG have attracted a large number of researchers in life science 
and medicine since a half century ago. The EEG is normally composed of the following 
rhythmic components: δ-wave (0~4Hz), θ-wave (4~8Hz), α-wave (8~13Hz), β-wave 
(13~30Hz), and γ (30~70Hz). Researches during the past several decades have disclosed the 
phenomenon that particular EEG patterns correlated closely with some physiological, mental, 
or emotional states. For instance, occipital α-wave becomes dominant during the eye-closed 
relaxation. Significant and numerous achievements have been reported on EEG rhythmic and 
EEG spatial characteristics applied to brain abnormalities and such pathological case study as 
epilepsy [3-5] and Alzheimer’s disease [6]. Accordingly, EEG has become a feasible tool for 
diagnosing neural disorder diseases. 
In the past two decades, scientists and medical experts have been getting more and more 
interested in meditation phenomena due to its benefits to human health[7-11]. A large variety 
of scientific approaches have been applied to meditation study. Since meditation process

brainwaves, though this use is discouraged, because the brain was not known to broadcast 
electrical waves. The EEG offers a medium for the brain function test, but in clinical use it is 
a "gross correlate of brain activity". We actually do not measure the electrical currents, but 
rather the potential differences between different parts of the brain 
EEG applications in clinic have become more and more favorable because of its 
advantages of economy, safety, and convenience. EEG can be used for detecting apoplexy, 
epilepsy, cephalitis, etc. EEG studies have also been employed in patients who are deeply 
unconscious, to distinguish between brain death and possible reversible conditions. And it is 
also used to investigate other conditions that may affect brain function such as strokes, brain 
injuries, liver and kidney disease and dementia. In this study, we adopted 30-channel 
recording montage as shown in Figure 1.

meditation state, differing from the occipital alpha often observed in normal subjects during 
eye-closed relaxation. Therefore, we focused on the analysis of the frontal-alpha brain 
microstates. The first task thus was to identify the occurrence of frontal-alpha activities. 
Hence we developed the pattern recognition technique to cluster the alpha activities into 
frontal-, parietal-, and occipital-alpha segments. And we analyzed the frontal and occipital 
alpha in meditation and the others (parietal alpha, occipital alpha) in relax by brain microstate. 
The concept of MD includes the correlations of the data. We thus identified patterns of 
similarity based on this characteristic. In the study, brain spatial distributions were clustered 
by the approach of unsupervised pattern recognition. The aim was to group similar objects 
together. As a measure of similarity, the MD can be used to link similar populations together 
by computing the MD between population means (centroids). In combination with FCM, the 
MD replaced the Euclidean distance in the membership value function. Clustering scheme 
applying the fuzzy concept together with data correlation could achieve better efficiency. 
Results of clustering were then investigated by brain microstate analysis. 
 
II.1 Outline of the scheme 
The entire scheme applied in this study is illustrated in Figure 2. This block diagram 
describes the whole scheme correlating different theories and methods to accomplish our aim 
of characterizing the multi-channel EEG spatial behaviors. Following this flowchart, details 
of theories and methods will be introduced. To quantify alpha power, we applied wavelet

II.2 Alpha Wave Detection 
    For researching the effects of the alpha-wave, it is important to make sure that a trail of 
EEG is alpha dominate. We use wavelet transform to extract the wavelet coefficients of α, β, γ, 
δ, θ waves, and reconstructed them to calculate the α, β, γ, δ, θ power. Eq. (1), defines ρ  as

determine the degree of similarity of an unknown variable to the known one. It differs from 
Euclidean distance in that it takes into account the correlations of the data and is 
scale-invariant, that is, independent of the scale of measurements. 
    Fuzzy c-means (FCM) is a fuzzy classifier based on the cluster means. Instead of 
reaching a crispy decision like “0/1”, “true/false”, or “yes/no”, fuzzy allows the degree of truth 
of a statement ranging between 0 and 1. It is more suitable and feasible for classification and 
analysis of most empirical biomedical data. In this study, we employed MD distance 
measurement in the membership value of FCM and compared the difference of classification 
results with or without correlation computation. 
II.3.1 Mahalanobis Distance 
    The correlation is calculated from the inverse of the variance-covariance matrix of the 
data. However, the computation of variance-covariance matrix could cause problems. When 
the empirical data are measured over a large number of variables (for example, channels), 
they may contain a large amount of redundant or correlated information. The resulting 
variance-covariance matrix may become a singular or nearly singular matrix that can not be 
inversed. 
    In the case of object-i with 30 dimensional map ( )1 2 30, ,i i i ix µ µ µ= L , the ED with 
regard to the center map can be calculated for each object. Assume totally N objects, ED for 
object-i is computed as

ellipses representing the equal MDs. 
 
II.3.2 Mahalanobis Fuzzy C-Means Algorithm 
The fuzzy-based classification algorism was improved by the scheme of c-means. By 
proper design of the membership function, we may improve the performance of classification. 
FCM (Fuzzy c-means) is different from c-means. Method of c-means performs poorly when 
the data set is fuzzy.  
In this study, we employed the Mahalanobis FCM algorithm. Mahalanobis FCM 
algorithm evaluates the MD instead of ED in the membership-function construction. To 
introduce Mahalanobis FCM, we firstly summarize the parameters and variables in Table 1.

calculated by short-time spectral analysis based on Fourier-transformation method within a 
specific time window. Notice that Fourier approach is restricted by the piecewise stationary 
property that requires a narrow window of analysis and the frequency resolution that desires a 
wide window. In general, the window width is in the range from 1 to 5 seconds. However, 
from the viewpoint of the microscopic neural activities, the message is transmitted on the time 
scale of mini-second. The traditional FFT method is restricted to the window length and is 
difficult to explore the cerebral microstate.  
In the research of Lehmann [16,17], he considered that the consistent neural activities 
would results in higher Global Field Power (GFP). The GFP is defined as the sum of the 
powers of all recoding channels at a specific sampling moment. The activity of each neuron 
could be considered as an electrical dipole vector including magnitude and direction. If each 
vector is uncorrelated with others, the activities would be canceled each other. In some 
conditions, neurons are driven by the same source that leads to a large GFP. As larger GFP 
often infers better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the driven response can be more significant 
with less noise interference. The appearance of local maximal GFP’s is thus an appropriate 
reference for choosing representative brain mappings (landscapes) to be utilized in the spatial 
microstate analysis. The sites of extremes (maximum and minimum) of a particular brain 
mapping compose a current dipole model generating the brain potential distribution recorded 
on the scalp. 
We analyzed the brain microstates for a given time period ‘segment’. A segment is a

II.4.1 Global Field Power (GFP) 
Global field power (GFP) at a given time instant represents the summation of EEG 
powers of all channels at that particular time t. A high GFP stands for a potential distribution 
with many peaks and troughs. According to [18], brain mappings with maximal GFP’s 
normally have better SNR (signal-noise-ration) performance. Hence, GFP provides a 
reference for us to select the appropriate time instants for microstates analysis. Assume a 
series kA  represents the data of channel- k . GFP is a function of time as shown below:

Where i represents the time point of discrete time signal and chn  is number of channel. In 
this thesis, the chn  is defined as 30. 
    Figure 5 displays the GFP of a one-second EEG epoch. Apparently, GFP oscillates at a 
rhythm twice the EEG frequency due to the rectification effect.

A brain microstate is defined as the constant landscape (brain topographical mapping) 
that lasts for a momentarily continuous time segment. The landscape was obtained by a 
131msec moving window. Compute the power in the window and it results a 30 dimensional 
map. Note that we recorded 30-channel EEG in our experiment with a sampling rate of 1,000 
Hz. Within a 4-second EEG epoch, we can obtain almost 4,000 maps. Previous study [18] has 
demonstrated that maximum GFP normally resulted in a good signal-to-noise ratio. This is 
accordingly a moderate clue for choosing the representative maps. We thus focused on the 
locations of extremes (maximum and minimum power value) of brain mappings.  
In our study, brain microstates are characterized by the current dipole vector pointing 
from the minimum to the maximum potential of the multichannel EEG mapping on the scalp. 
As a consequence, it becomes important to determine the appropriate locations (EEG 
channels) where extremes occur. Sometimes the extremes might be influenced by the noise. 
To deal with the noise problem, we developed an approach for better extracting the extremes. 
First, we employed the spherical-coordinate model of the EEG electrodes to compute 
the average distance Dn between Cz and each of the rest 29 electrode sites. We then computed 
the local average power (LAP) of brain potentials within the Dn-radius circle centered on each 
channel. From the set of 30 local average powers (LAP’s), extremes (maximum and minimum) 
could be determined in a sense of better statistical significance. Finally, the centered electrode 
of maximal and minimal LAP forms the dipole vector of the brain microstate.  
In order to obtain the data with an optimal SNR, only the maps at the peaks (local 
 24
A larger threshold could cause the different microstates as the same state, and on the 
other hand, a smaller threshold could separate one microstate into several segments. Either a 
small or a large threshold may not reliably reflect the evolution of microstates, so we had to 
find a suitable range for this threshold. According to our experiment, the threshold in the 
range of 0.7Dn ~ 1.5Dn provides obviously different dipole vectors with the range of 0.5Dn 
and 2Dn ; while the locations of dipole vectors in range of 0.7Dn ~ 1.5Dn are about the same 
as the frontal alpha, so it represent that the efficacy of segmentation are quiet the same in this 
region. Hence the threshold in this range (0.7Dn ~ 1.5Dn) is feasible. This study adopted Dn as 
the threshold.

II.5 Experimental Protocol 
As illustrated in Figure 6, the entire recording experiment involved three sessions: pre-, 
mid-, and post-meditation session for experimental subjects who have been practicing Chan 
meditation, and pre-, mid-, and post-relaxation session for control subjects that are normal, 
 26
classification and microstate analysis. 
 
III.1 Results of Brain-Mapping Classification 
In this section, we report the results of classifying brain topographical mappings by 
Mahalanobis FCM. In addition, results are compared between experimental and control group. 
As mentioned in II.1, wavelet analysis was applied to each 2-second (pre-filtered by a 
band-pass filter) EEG epoch to decompose raw EEG into characteristic rhythmic patterns. The 
epoch was identified to be alpha-dominated if the alpha power was at least 50% the total EEG 
power 
 
III.1.1 Control Subjects   
Figures 6 to 8 display the classification results of one representative subject (20040315) 
in the control group. The results were classified into three clusters (classes). Notice that the 
color charts reflect the associate cluster (Cluster 1, 2, or 3) identified at the time instant of the 
2-sec window centering. The color charts thus display the temporal evolution of 
brain-mapping cluster.

dipoles( in maxima GFPs) in one minute (Figure 16). And we found that the location of 
minimum power changed frequently, the minimum power location is usually in the edge; but 
the values of power in the edge locations are very close, so we think the frequently changed 
location of minimum power cause the results of duration of alpha brain microstate shorter. 
Hence following shows the microstate results which the segment only adopts the maximum

In this study, we mainly proposed a novel approach for analyzing the spatial-temporal

rhythms. Then, the further step may be taken to investigate the spatio-spectral microstate of 
alpha brain either during Chan meditation or at normal relaxation.

Abstract: 
This paper reports our preliminary result of microstate 
analysis for the spatiotemporal characteristics of 
Chan-meditation brain wave (electroencephalograph, EEG) 
based on time-varying dipolar-vector model of the α-map. 
Microstate behavior reveals subtle transience of focalized 
event. Multi-channel α-event epochs were identified by 
Wavelet decomposition and feature extraction. Global field 
power was adopted as the criterion to choose α-map 
candidates (normalized α-power vectors), that were further 
classified by Mahalanobis Fuzzy C-means into different 
region-focalization states. Transition between various α-event 
focalization states was ready to be explored via microstate 
analysis. Our findings reveal that Chan-meditation 
practitioners exhibit longer duration of frontal α-event 
microstate, reflecting sustained stability of the brain 
generators.

1. Introduction 
For decades, scientific exploration on meditation 
benefits has corroborated the effectiveness of meditation 
practice on the health promotion, hypertension treatment, 
anti-aging, hormone-level regulation, stress manipulation, 
anxiety reduction, etc. [1], [2]. In the course of Chan 
meditation, practitioners experience various states of 
consciousness, according to their subjective narration, that 
transcends the physiological (the fifth), mental (the sixth), 
subconscious (the seventh), and Alaya (the eighth) 
conscious state, and eventually reaches the spiritual realm. 
EEG measuring thus has been intensively studied to explore 
the underlying brain physiological changes correlating to 
various states of consciousness during meditation. 
Numerous studies have been conducted since 1960s [3]–[7]. 
Although the neuro-electrophysiological correlation of 
meditation-elicited consciousness state is still an open 
question, the predominant EEG findings in most meditation 
techniques have implicated the increase in theta- and 
alpha-band power and the decrease at least in alpha 
frequency [2], [5], [7]. 
In the field of EEG study, the spatial or topographical 
features provide an access to the detection of focal EEG 
phenomena that have a relationship to focal pathology or 
brain dynamic origin [8]-[10]. The spatial distribution of 
EEG features over the scalp surface, often called the EEG 
mapping or the brain mapping, offers a quickly pictorial 
assessment of possible event focalization. Such graphical 
display provides an easy and straightforward aid to visual 
inspection of focal activities in clinical diagnosis, yet, 
cannot resolve stable-to-transient behaviors of the focal 
source. 
According to our study on Chan-meditation EEG 
during the past decade, a number of EEG characteristics 
have been found to be evidently linked to the 
Chan-meditation practice [11]-[13]. We have reported our 
findings on frontal alpha activity and beta-dominated 
phenomena, mainly from the temporal and spectral aspects. 
This work was particularly focused on subtle behaviors of 
spatiotemporal shifting of EEG α-event focalization during 
Chan meditation, based on the concept of spatial microstate 
analysis. 
2. Theory and Method 
The EEG content is generally interpreted according to 
the frequency ranges that include δ-wave (0~4Hz), θ-wave 
(4~8Hz), α-wave (8~13Hz), β-wave (13~30Hz), and γ 
(30~70Hz). Researches during the past several decades 
have disclosed the phenomenon that particular EEG 
patterns correlated closely with some physiological, mental, 
or emotional states. For instance, occipital α-wave becomes 
dominant during the eye-closed relaxation; while frontal 
α-wave characterizes a certain stage of inward-attention 
  
20-minute EEG. 
FCM clustering requires the determination of cluster 
number (c) in advance. Starting from a large value of c, we 
computed the correlation coefficients of the cluster centers. 
Two clusters are identified to be similar and merged 
together when the correlation coefficient is larger than a 
given threshold θ. Empirical value of θ=0.3 provides 
satisfactory result of clustering. 
2.4. Alpha-map spatial microstates 
To investigate the spatial behaviors of event (α-map) 
localization of Chan-meditation brain dynamics, we 
examined the temporal steadiness-versus-transience of focal 
source on a 4-second basis. The concept of microstate 
analysis provides a medium of exploring subtle evolution of 
focal event that might reveal microscopic mechanisms of 
brain dynamics accounting for transcendental state of Chan 
meditation. 
Distribution of brain potentials is modeled by a 
4-dimensional function of time (t) and space (x, y, z). 
Construction of focal source highly depends on selection of 
time instant. According to Lehmann [15], consistent neural 
activities would result in higher global field power (GFP). 
The GFP is defined as the sum of the powers of all EEG 
recoding sites at a specific time. A large GFP often infers 
significant dipolar focalization and, evidently, promises 
better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance. The 
appearance of temporally local maximal GFP is thus an 
appropriate reference for choosing representative brain 
mappings (landscapes) for the spatial microstate analysis. 
The sites of extremes (maximum and minimum) of a 
particular brain mapping compose a current dipole model 
generating the brain potential distribution recorded on the 
scalp. Let Ak denote the EEG potential at channel-k and nch 
be the number of channel. GFP evaluated at time instant i 
is:

Brain microstate is defined as the constant landscape 
(brain-potential topographical mapping) that lasts for a 
momentarily continuous time segment. In our study, the 
landscape was obtained by a 131msec moving window that 
approximately enclosed the longest α-wave epoch. To 
characterize the particular microstate, the current-dipole 
vector, pointing from the minimal to the maximal potential, 
was derived from the landscape. To avoid the effect of noise 
contamination, electrodes of extremes were determined as 
follows. First, distance Dn was computed by averaging all 
the inter-distances between Cz and each of the rest 29 
electrode sites. We then computed the local average 
potential (LAP) of EEG potentials within the radius-Dn 
circular region centered on each channel. The extremes 
were finally determined from the set of 30 LAP values. The 
centered electrodes of maximal and minimal LAP form the 
dipole vector of the brain microstate. 
To quantify the transient against stationary behaviors 
of α-microstates, we define the segment of a microstate as 
the time duration of a particular focalized event 
(current-dipole vector) that produces consistent 
brain-potential mappings. The segment continues if the 
extreme LAP sites are in the pre-defined range and ends if 
the sites are out of range. Note that each segment may 
belong to a particular class defined by the extreme LAP 
sites. Within the same group, four parameters were derived: 
a) number of maximum GFP peaks, b) average duration of 
the segment, c) number of segments per second, and d) 
maximum duration of the segments. 
3. Results 
Based on wavelet decomposition and M-FCM, EEG 
spatial features were analyzed and the extracted α-maps 
were classified into three clusters. Figure 3 displays three 
clusters derived from the α-maps of one experimental 
subject, including occipital, parietal, and frontal α-maps 
(denoted by αO, αP, and αF).

2.2. Wavelet analysis for α-power estimation 
According to our previous studies [11]-[13], EEG 
epoch of 2 seconds is appropriate for identifying a typical 
EEG rhythm based on wavelet analysis. Frontal alpha was 
highly correlated with a specific meditation state. We thus 
began with the analysis of frontal-alpha brain microstates. 
To identify the emergence of frontal-alpha activities, we 
applied wavelet transform to extracting the wavelet 
coefficients of α, β, γ, δ, and θ waves and then calculating 
their powers after reconstructing each particular EEG 
rhythm [12]. Next, the α-dominated epochs can be 
extracted by the criterion ρ≥50%, where ρ is the percentage 
of α power to the total power:

p p p p p

ρ = ×

 (1) 
In this study, an α-dominated epoch only requires at least 
one channel satisfying the ρ-criterion. 
 
2.3. Mahalanobis fuzzy C-means (M-FCM) 
After temporal searching for α-dominated EEG epochs 
(denoted by map xi), we developed the pattern recognition 
scheme, based on fuzzy c-means, to cluster the alpha 
activities into frontal-, parietal-, and occipital-alpha 
segments. And we analyzed the frontal and occipital 
α-wave microstates in Chan-meditation as well as the 
occipital and parietal α-wave microstates in relaxation. 
Fuzzy c-means (FCM) is a fuzzy classifier based on 
the cluster means. Instead of reaching a crispy decision like 
“0/1” or “true/false”, fuzzy allows the degree of truth of a 
statement to range between 0 and 1. It is more suitable and 
feasible for classifying and analyzing the biomedical data. 
In this study, we employed MD (Mahalanobis Distance) 
measurement, instead of Euclidean distance (ED), in the 
FCM membership function reconstruction [14]. In feature 
clustering based on FCM, MD is superior to ED in the 
aspect that MD takes into account the correlations of the 
data set and is scale-invariant. 
Consider xi = (μi1, μi2, …μi30) as the ith sample of 
totally N 30-channel α-dominated brain mappings (briefly, 
α-map) extracted by ρ-criterion. MD distance is computed 
by

The centralized data matrix is Xc=(X− X ) where X is an

In the beginning 3-min meditation, occipital and 
parietal α maps interweaved. After a particular α-blank 
mindful attention in the mid 3-min, α-event was found to 
propagate toward frontal region at the end of the 10-min 
course. 
Note that, in control group, three α-map clusters 
contain mainly the occipital and centro-parietal α-maps 
(denoted by αO and αCP), as shown in Figure 4, with frontal 
α-maps (αF) diminishing. 
 
 
Figure 4. Classification result of one control subject (in 
main session) and 5-min temporal evolution of 
different α-map clusters. 
 
Microstate analysis for α-event demonstrates that, in 
the experimental group, frontal α-event persists longer than 
occipital α-event (average segment length is 89.8ms for αF 
and 71.5ms for αO, while maximum segment length is 
221ms for αF and 201ms for αO). 
Figure 5 displays the 1-min temporal evolution of 
α-event dipole vector, pointing from minimum (०) to 
maximum (•). Apparently, αF and αO dipoles might 
originate in the regions other than frontal (occipital) area. 
Subtle transience of αF and αO microstates was clearly 
explored in this scheme. 
 
4. Conclusions 
This paper presents a novel approach for exploring the 
spatial-temporal characteristics of various α-maps down to 
the milli-second portrait, instead of long-time trend. 
Wavelet analysis and M-FCM successfully extracted and 
classified various α-maps. Experimental subjects 
apparently exhibited more frontal alpha αF than control 
subjects. In Chan-meditation EEG results, average duration 
of the α-map microstate segment is longer in frontal alpha 
than in occipital alpha. 
 
 
Figure 5. Dipolar vector evolution for α-event 
 
Results of microstate analysis revealed the difference 
of αF group and αO group in mediation. Longer duration of 
microstate occurs in αF, instead of αO. This might be an 
evidence correlating to the neuro-physiological state of 
meditation that involves the region of frontal cortex relating 
to the hormone modulated. Furthermore, sustained stability 
of α-event with this reaction may infer the state of less 
information processing. Consistent increase of frontal alpha 
can be recognized as the major distinction between 
meditation and relaxation. At this stage of meditation, 
according to meditators’ narration, they calmed down their 
mind and shut off their sensors to the outside stimuli by 
concentrating their attention on a specific spot. Such inward 
attention conduct may result in the increase of frontal alpha
