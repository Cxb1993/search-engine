五、文獻探討
Knowledge management activities
Desouza (2003) defined knowledge management as the collection of all the activities of knowledge
creation, knowledge storage, knowledge diffusion and knowledge applications. Alavi & Leidner (2001)
pointed out that knowledge management is a process of organizational and systematic retrievals,
organization and communication with other employees concerning implicit and explicit knowledge. The
purpose is to create the maximum utilities and productivity by leveraging knowledge of each other.
Liebowitz (1999) stated that knowledge management is a process of identifying, acquiring, storing,
sharing, applying and selling knowledge. Bhatt (2001) indicated that knowledge management is a process
of creating, validating, presenting, delivering and applying knowledge. This paper summarizes the result
of the literature review and establishes four dimensions for knowledge management activities. These
dimensions are the acquisition and creation of knowledge, storage of knowledge, sharing of knowledge
and application of knowledge.
Information technology involvement
Yang (2009) defined information technology as the total assets of investments in information
technology. Such assets can be hardware, software and manpower. Sakaguchi & Dibrell (1998) argued
that the degrees of information technology involvement can be measured with the investment and training
in information technology. Information technology investment is a quantitative indicator to measure
budgets, hardware and software. Information technology training refers to the levels of training of the
personnel as users of information technology. Chung et al. (2010) reviewed relevant literature and group
information technology involvement into the following four dimensions: (1) perceptions of employees; (2)
investments in hardware and software; (3) personnel training and (4) the degrees of information
technology application. This study refers to Chung et al. (2010) in the classification of classify
information technology involvement into four dimensions.
Organizational cultures
Siew & Kelvin (2004) proposed that organizational cultures are unique atmosphere or belief created
jointly by organizational members. In terms of the classification of organizational cultures, Quinn (1988)
suggested that that the competing values framework consists of four cultural types, which are rational
4the performance of new product developments.
Information technology involvement and performance of new product developments
Hull et al. (1996) indicated that information technology involvement plays an important role in the
process of new product developments. Sanders & Premus (2002) suggested that the application of
information technology in the development of new products can enhance product quality, lower costs and
maintain low-term competitiveness. Based on the above literature review, this paper proposes H4: The
higher the information technology involvement, the more significant the positive influence on the
performance of new product developments.
Organizational cultures and performance of new product developments
Hsieh (2005) indicated that the companies of different cultures report varying performances of new
product developments. Manufacturers with innovative corporate cultures tend to achieve better results for
new product developments. Belassi et al (2007) argued that different organizational cultures report
significantly different levels of impacts on the performance of new product developments. Based on the
above literature review, this paper proposes H5: Different types of organizational cultures report
significantly different levels of influence on the performance of new product developments.
六、研究方法
This study examines the correlation among information technology involvement, organizational
cultures, knowledge management activities and performance of new product developments.
Research hypotheses
Based on the above literature review, this paper proposes the following hypotheses:
H1: The higher the information technology involvement, the more significant the positive influence on the
implementation of knowledge management activities.
H2: The stronger the organizational cultures, the more significant the positive influence on the
implementations of knowledge management activities.
H3: The higher degree of the knowledge management activities, the more significant the positive
influence on the performance of new product developments.
H4: The higher the information technology involvement, the more significant the positive influence on the
performance of new product developments.
H5: Different types of organizational cultures report significantly different levels of influence on the
performance of new product developments.
Questionnaire collection and data analysis
The subjects of this research were Taiwan’s high-tech firms in the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial
Park, Central Taiwan Science-based Industrial Park and Southern Taiwan Science-based Industrial Park.
The questionnaires were anonymous and distributed to 624 companies at the beginning of February 2010.
The respondents were the project members or senior managers involved, currently or previously, in the
6performance of new products. The measurement is based on Likert 5–point scale, where“Stronglyagree” 
is 5 points, “Agree” is 4 points, “Fair” is 3 points, “Disagree” is 2 points, and “Strongly disagree” is 1
point..
Industry group and enterprise scale
This paper examines industry characteristics with two metrics, which are industry group and
enterprise scale：(1) Industry group: According to the classification published in 2010 Directory of
Manufacturers in Science Park, these industries are integrated circuits, computers & peripherals,
communication, optical electronics, delicate machinery and biotechnology; (2) Enterprise scale: In
accordance with the standards set forth by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, this paper classifies
high-tech manufacturers into large ones (with over 200 employees) and small-and-medium ones (with
less than 200 employees). Both industry group and enterprise scale are measured with nominal scales.
Validation Results

Correlation between organizational cultures and knowledge management activities
The study finds that the stronger the organizational cultures, the more significant the positive
influence on the implementations of knowledge management activities. Different cultural types (i.e.,
rational cultures, hierarchical cultures, group cultures and developmental cultures) do not have any
significant influence on the implementation of knowledge management activities. The research finding
supports H2.
8hierarchical cultures, group cultures, developmental cultures) do not have any significant influence on the
performance of new product developments. Hence, H5 is rejected.
The influence of the executive degree of organizational culture, knowledge management activities
and information technology involvement of the manufacturers with different industry
characteristics on new product development performance
The results show that industry characteristics do not have a significant influence on the executive
degree of organizational culture, knowledge management activities and information technology
involvement. The manufacturers from different industry groups and enterprise scale do not reveal a
significant influence on their new product development performance. As seen above, for the
manufacturers with different industry characteristics, the executive degree of organizational culture,
knowledge management activities and information technology involvement do not reveal significant
impact on new product development performance.
七、結論與建議
This paper examines the correlation between information technology involvements, organizational
cultures, degrees of knowledge management activities and the performance of new product developments.
The results reveal that the higher the degrees of information technology involvement and organizational
cultures, the more significant the influence on the implementation of knowledge management activities
and performance of new product developments. The better the implementation of knowledge
management activities, the stronger the positive influence on the performance of new product
developments. Hence, this paper suggests that to enhance the performance of new product developments,
it is necessary to strengthen information technology involvement and the implementation of knowledge
management activities, as well as to integrate the characteristics of the four cultural types in the
competing values framework and to enhance the implementation under these four cultural types. This
paper only examines the high-tech manufacturers. Future studies can perform an empirical analysis on
other industries, to investigate the influence of information technology involvement, organizational
cultures and implementation of knowledge management on the performance of new product
developments in different sectors.
