stabilize at the upright equilibrium position by 
the method of adaptive sliding mode. The 
authors of [13] utilized the stability analysis of 
hybrid dynamical system [14], [15] to obtain the 
control law and to stabilize the Pendubot 
system. 
In the research report, a novel backstepping 
controller is developed for the balancing design 
of the Pendubot system. The backstepping [17], 
[18] control is a newly developed technique for 
the control of uncertain systems [16], 
particularly those nonlinear systems in both 
output feedback and strict feedback cases. The 
most appealing point of it is to use the virtual 
control variable to make the original high-order 
system simple, thus the final control outputs can 
be derived step by step though suitable 
Lyapunov functions. For achieving our desire 
control objectives with backstepping scheme, 
the Pendubot system is divided into two zones. 
The Pendubot is in the stabilization zone if the 
angles of both rods are within a particular range. 
Otherwise, the Pendubot is in the swing-up zone. 
The control objective is to swing up the both 
rods into the stabilization zone by PD controller 
when the both rods are at the downward position. 
When both rods are within the stabilization zone 
from the downward position, the Pendubot will 
be switched from swing-up controller to 
backstepping controller which makes the 
Pendubot stay at the upright position. In 
addition, in order to analyze and design the 
controller conveniently, the partial feedback 
linearization [19] will be introduced to reduce 
the system complexity. 
 
三、結果與討論 
In general, the dynamic equation of 
underactusted systems can be represented as 
follows by the Lagrange’s formulation: 
τBqGqqqNqqM =++ )(),()( &&&& .    (1) 
In (1), it is the generalized standard form of the 
underactuated system, where qq & ,  and q&&  are 
the position, velocity and acceleration vectors, 
respectively, )(qM  is an inertial matrix which 
is positive definite and symmetric, ),( qqN &  is a 
matrix which is relative to the centripetal force 
and Coriolis force, )(qG  is a vector including 
gravity term, and τB  is a vector of the control  
torque with insufficient input components. In 
addition, the matrix ),(2)( qqNqM && −  is a skew 
symmetric matrix. 
The Pendubot is a special case of 
underactuated systems, so the dynamic 
equations of Pendubot must satisfy (1). The 
overall structure of the Pendubot system [20] is 
shown in the Fig. 1. Therefore, we have

is the angle of the rod 2. The angles of the rod 1 
and the rod 2 are defined to be zero at the 
upright position, and to be positive when the rod 
1 and rod 2 move in clockwise direction. In 
addition,  u  is the control torque applied to 
the rod 1, since there is not any actuator applied 
to the rod 2. 
The Pendubot system is widely employed 
for research on nonlinear control for education 
in various concepts like nonlinear dynamics, 
robots and control system design. This device is 
a two-link planar robot. The rod 1 is connected 
to the DC motor and rotates with the torque

Now, The backstepping scheme will be 
applied to design the controller to reach our 
control goals in the stabilization zone. The 
backstepping design procedure consists of the 
following steps:

The error states 1z  and 2z  are asymptotically 
stable according to Lyapunov stability theorem. 
The controller v  guarantees 1z  and 2z  to

Here, if the design constants 1k  and 2k  can be 
chosen appropriately, then the stability of the 
zero dynamic system (19) can be guaranteed. 
The 22×  matrix in (19) is guaranteed to be 
Hurwitz if 1k  and 2k  are selected to satisfy 
the following inequalities:

This implies that the rod 1 angle and angle 
velocity will converge to zero. Therefore, the 
results can be observed from (11), when 1x  and 
3x  converge to zero, 2x  also converges to 
zero from (14), then 4x  must converge to zero 
according to Lyapnuov stability theorem. All 
states can be guaranteed to converge to zero. 
Finally, from (9) and (16) the desired linear 
controller can be obtained as follows:

the convergence of desired objectives in design 
process. After our analysis of zero dynamics for 
the system, the appropriate choice of 1k  and 
2k  can successfully achieve our control goals. 
The swing-up controller designed by the PD 
method can swing up the both rods from the 
downward equilibrium point into stabilization 
zone, and then the Pendubot system will be 
switched to the backstepping controller for 
balancing the rods. In addition, the backstepping 
method has been applied to different pendulum 
systems in [5] and [6] for obtaining outstanding 
performance. Hence, a nonlinear backstepping 
scheme without switching controllers will be 
designed to swing up the double link rods from 
downward position to upright position in the 
further research.
