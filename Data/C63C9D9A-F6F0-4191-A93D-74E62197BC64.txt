摘要 
近年來，反射面天線在超寬頻通信和雷達應用中得到廣泛的應用[1-4]。在這些應用中的實
際過程中，需要保持良好的圓極化特性是非常重要的。然而，由於反射面表面大小和形狀
的限制，圓極化輻射特性會由於反射面的散射發生惡化[5-8].TE 模和 TM 模之間的極化偏
差會隨著電波的偏離波束方向的角度增加而加大。由於 TE 和 TM 兩個模式之間是完全正
交的，它們之間的所佔用的百分比應當儘量保持一致。特別地，在高頻應用中，該偏差受
表面某些微小的變差其影響會加倍。表面的均方誤差需要小於 1.5mm 才能達到較高的效率
[10].如此之高的準確度在實際的製造工藝上較難實現，所以需要一種能夠補償該偏差的方
法。 
 
 
Abstract 
Reflector antennas have been shown wide applications such as in the Ultra Wide-Band (UWB) 
communication and radar applications in recent years [1–4]. Among these applications, antenna 
radiation with good circular polarizations (CP) is one of the important interested designs in 
practical applications. However, due to the finite size and shape of the reflecting surface, the 
performance of the CP radiation may experience degradation as the feed’s radiation scatters from 
the reflecting surface [5–8]. This polarization discrimination of TE and TM modes, which 
corresponds to the two orthogonal components of the CP fields, grows while the angle of incident 
waves increased with respect to the antenna’s boresite [9]. This discrimination especially 
increases at high frequencies as the surface distortion increases rapidly in terms of wavelength, 
where a RMS surface accuracy of less than 1.5mm is generally required if a high antenna 
efficiency is to be achieved [10]. This high accuracy is potentially difficult to achieve in practical 
manufactures. It is thus important to develop techniques to compensate this CP discrimination.

Abstract—An approach utilizing a paraboloid photonic crystal
structure (PPCS) is proposed in this paper to compensate the
polarization discrimination of an antenna’s radiation. It is
demonstrated by considering a reﬂector antenna excited by a pair
of crossed-dipoles, whose circularly polarized (CP) radiation may be
distorted due to the scattering from the ﬁnite reﬂector surface. The
proposed approach tends to compensate the discrimination and achieve
a wider beamwidth of good axial ratios while, in the mean time,
retaining a less gain loss. The advantage of this approach is that

of low axial ratio as proposed here.
This paper is formatted in the following order. Section 2 describes
the proposed approach. Especially the reﬂector antenna is assumed to
be fed by a pair of crossed-dipoles that is a classical approach to radiate
CP ﬁelds in practical applications. Section 3 describes environments
and parameters used in the simulation studies. The parameters of
the proposed PPCS design are also described. Numerical studies, as
well as examples, to validate the concepts are presented in Section 4.
Finally some discussions are presented in Section 5 as a conclusion to
this work.

Figure 2. Ray tracing on the paraboloidal reﬂector.
Thus if the feed is located at the focal point, all reﬂected rays
propagates in parallel at the aperture and produce an in-phase ﬁeld
distribution on the aperture [18–20]. If the feed has ideal CP
radiations, the aperture ﬁelds will theoretically produce good CP
radiations when the aperture is extended to inﬁnity because the
asymptotic evaluation of (1) will reduce to GO ray ﬁelds of plane waves
[17].
In reality, the CP radiation degrades for the following reasons.
First, the ﬁnite aperture size (corresponding to a ﬁnite reﬂector
size) will rise edge diﬀractions to contaminate the CP radiation,
whose eﬀects are apparent if the reﬂector is not very large. Second,
the distortion of the reﬂector surface caused in the procedure
of manufacture will deviate the reﬂected rays from propagating
in parallel. This deviation distorts the polarization of the ﬁeld
distribution on the aperture and thus in turn degrades the CP
radiation. Third, a reﬂector tends to concentrate the energy of feed’s
radiation. Realistic feeds have good CP radiations only near feeds’
boresite directions. The CP performance deviates increasingly as
the angles of radiation deviate oﬀ the boresite directions. These
CP degradations will pollute the CP of the ﬁeld distribution on the
aperture. In general, the CP radiation of the reﬂector antenna degrades
rapidly as the radiation angles are oﬀ the antenna boresite.
The gain will also degrade, too. Assuming a feed without loss
and reﬂector being in the far zone of the feed, (1) may result in the
Progress In Electromagnetics Research, PIER 85, 2008 399
2.2. The Proposed Compensation Approach
The CP degradation of the reﬂector antenna is compensated by using
a PPCS that is developed utilizing a multi-layered substrate. The
formation of the layers exhibits periodicity using dielectric materials
that can be recognized as multilayer ﬁlms printed on a bottom
dielectric substrate [5, 21, 22]. The full-wave analysis of the printed
conductors, consisting of multilayered array of patches in a stratiﬁed
dielectric medium, has been proposed, but it is still computationally
heavy [23–26]. The diﬀerent mechanisms of energy re-distribution in
the TE and TM modes may be used to make their ratio become smaller
if the structure is designed properly because at high frequencies the
radio waves have characteristics of propagation similar to ray optics.
Based on the KP (Kronig-Penney) model [9], we design PPCS with
the values of permittivity in a ABAB alternative form materialsas can
be seen in Figure 3.

Figure 3. Reﬂection and transmission in a PPCS.
Figure 3 is a planar multi-layered substrate to illustrate the wave
propagation through a PPCS, which is to approximate the PPCS in
the local vicinity of a point where the ﬁelds radiated from the parabolic
reﬂector illuminate the PPCS. Thus using the boundary condition
that the tangential components of the resultant E- and H-ﬁeld are
continuous across the interface and their magnitudes on either side are
equal. Under this restriction of the boundary condition [27], we get
the relation of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds between the adjacent
layers of the crystal:[

Figure 4. Transmission coeﬃcients and TE/TM ratio of a PPCS.
the reﬂector’s size is comparable with the feed’s size, thus the edge
diﬀracted ﬁelds may contaminate the CP radiation.
The PPCS is designed using a 4-layer substrate with the values of
relative permittivity in an ABAB alternative form. A glass substrate
is used at the top of the PPCS and ﬁelds are assumed to be incident
from air (n0 = 1). The values of relative permittivity of the 4 layers
below the glass substrate are determined by maximizing (13) using (9)–
(13) that implies most energy transfer into space. The incident ﬁelds
are assumed to be a plane wave propagating through the substrate at
various angles since a focus fed parabolic reﬂector produces a planar
wavefront in the near zone where PPCS is located. The largest angle
is selected that most of the energy penetrates through PPCS. The
determination requires intensive numerical examinations to search for
most appropriate values. However, Figure 4 shows an example of the
transmission coeﬃcient and TE/TM ratio with respect to the refraction
index, nB, of layer B where nA = 1.2 and the refraction index of glass
is nS = 1.52. In this case the incident angle is 30 degrees, and it is
found that the thickness of each layer is approximately λ/4, where λ
is the eﬀective wavelength of the substrate at 12.45 GHz. As shown
in Figure 4 that the transmission coeﬃcient has a maximum value
at nB = 1.08, and the TE/TM ratio is nearly equal to one within a
diﬀerence of ±0.04. Thus in the following examination, the values
of relative permittivity are selected by 1.44, 1.172, 1.44 and1.172,
respectively (which correspond to refraction index of 1.2 and 1.08,

4. NUMERICAL RESULTS
The analysis sweeps the frequency from 10 GHz to 15 GHz by 201
sampling points. First, the reﬂection coeﬃcients of the pair of
orthogonally crossed dipoles that excite the paraboloidal reﬂector are
shown in Figure 5, which shows good behaviors of operation at Ku-
band with this additional photonic crystal structure. It shows that the
placement of this additional photonic crystal structure does not incur
problems on the dipoles’ radiations.
Next, the variations of beamwidths are shown in Figure 6,
where the four curves are obtained by two scenarios, i.e., by taking
the −3 dB beamwidths using (15) from the crossed-dipole excited
reﬂector antenna’s radiations with and without the implementation
of the polarization compensation (indicated by “PPC” and “PNC”,
respectively). In Figure 6, “LT” and “LG” denote the radiations at
latitude and longitude directions, respectively (i.e., radiations at the
two principal planes of 0 and 90 degrees, respectively). The amplitude
ratio between the two dipoles’ excitations serves as a freedom to achieve
a good performance, which is labelled on the horizontal axis in Figure 6.
Several phenomena are observed. First, as the dipoles are nearly equal
excited (At the ratio of 1.05, the maximum beamwidth appears), the
radiation patterns at the two principal planes have same beamwidths

the gains due to the change of dipoles’ excitation ratio. GV is obtained
by comparing the gain losses shown in Figure 7 with the case that uses
an unity excitation ratio. The maximum GV is 60% while RTE/TM is
0.3. After that maximum value, GV decreases as RTE/TM grows. θM
plays no eﬀect on GV, all of them exhibit the same trends. Compared
with the widest beamwidth point in Figure 5, we can easily discover
that the maximum beamwidth occurs at the point near zero GV.
