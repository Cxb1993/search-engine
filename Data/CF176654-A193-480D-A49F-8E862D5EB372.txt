Abstract 
For the robust quadratic finite-horizon 
optimal control problem of the flexible 
mechanical systems with elemental 
parametric uncertainties, by integrating the 
robust stability condition, the orthogonal 
function approach (OFA), and the hybrid 
Taguchi-genetic algorithm (HTGA), an 
integrative method is presented to design the 
robust stability and quadratic finite-horizon 
optimal controllers with low trajectory 
sensitivity. In this project, the robust stability 
condition is proposed in terms of linear 
matrix inequalities (LMIs), where the robust 
stability condition takes the elemental 
information of parametric uncertain matrices 
into consideration. Based on the OFA, an 
algorithm only involving algebraic 
computation is derived in this project for 
solving the nominal mechanical dynamic 
equations, And by using the OFA, the 
robust-stable and quadratic finite-horizon 
optimal control problem for the mechanical 
dynamic systems is replaced by a static 
parameter optimization problem represented 
by algebraic equations with constraint of 
LMI-based robust stability condition; thus 
greatly simplifying the robust-stable and 
quadratic finite-horizon optimal control 
problem. The computational complexity for 
both differential and integral in the 
robust-stable and quadratic-optimal control 
design of the original dynamic systems may 
therefore be reduced considerably. Then, for 
the static constrainted-optimization problem, 
the HTGA is employed to find the 
robust-stable and quadratic finite-horizon 
optimal active vibration controllers of the 
flexible mechanical systems with the 
elemental parametric uncertainties. A design 
example of the robust-stable and quadratic 
finite-horizon optimal controllers for the 
simply-supported flexible beam system with 
the elemental parametric uncertainties is 
given to demonstrate the applicability of the 
proposed new integrative approach. 
Keywords: Flexible mechanical systems,

( ) )()()( txtCCty cccc Δ+= ,        (1b) integral performance index including a 
quadratic trajectory sensitivity term for the 
nominal flexible mechanical system can be 
minimized. Very recently, Ho and Chou (2007) 
have proposed a computational optimization 
method, which integrates the 
orthogonal-functions approach (OFA) and the 
genetic algorithm, to design the optimal fuzzy 
controllers. So, the purpose of this report is to 
propose an integrative optimization method to 
design the robust-optimal active vibration 
regulator and observer gains with low 
trajectory sensitivity for the uncertain flexible 
mechanical systems. The proposed integrative 
method complementarily fuses the OFA, the 
hybrid Taguchi-genetic algorithm (HTGA) 
and the robust stabilizability condition, where

ensuring that the closed-loop uncertain 
flexible mechanical system can be stabilized. 
An illustrative example is also given to 
demonstrate the applicability of the proposed 
integrative optimization method.

sensitivity of minimizing a quadratic 
finite-horizon integral performance criterion 
including a quadratic trajectory sensitivity 
term for the nominal dynamic systems is also 
considered in many practical control 
engineering applications (Friedland, 1986; 
Goodwin et al., 2001). On the other hand, 
before we are able to synthesize a controller 
with low trajectory sensitivity such that the 
good control performance including a 
quadratic trajectory sensitivity term for a 
given dynamic system can be efficiently 
achieved, it is necessary that the given 
dynamic system can be stabilized by the 
controller (Nise, 2000; Yu, 2002). Therefore, 
the problem considered in this paper is how to 
specify the estimator gain matrix  and the 
feedback gain matrix  in Eqs. (4) and (5), 
respectively, such that the constraint of 
LMI-based robust stabilizability condition in 
Eq. (7) for the closed-loop uncertain flexible 
mechanical dynamic system in Eq. (6) can be 
satisfied, and such that the optimal control 
performance including a quadratic trajectory 
sensitivity term for the nominal closed-loop 
flexible mechanical dynamic system

by using the OFA and the LMI-based robust

active vibration control with low trajectory 
sensitivity problem for the flexible mechanical 
systems with elemental parametric 
uncertainties can be replaced by a static 
constrained-optimization problem represented 
by the algebraic equations with constraints; 
thus greatly simplifying the robust-optimal 
active vibration control with low trajectory 
sensitivity problem. Then, the HTGA 
described-below can be employed to search 
for the optimal solution of the static 
constrained-optimization problem in Eq. (23), 
where Eq. (23) is a nonlinear function with the 
continuous variables. 
The HTGA combines the traditional 
genetic algorithm (GA) (Gen and Cheng, 1997) 
with the Taguchi method (Taguchi et al., 2000; 
Wu, 2000). In the HTGA, the Taguchi method 
is inserted between crossover and mutation 
operations of a TGA. Then, by using two 
major tools (signal-to-noise ratio and 
orthogonal arrays) of the Taguchi method, the 
systematic reasoning ability of Taguchi 
method is incorporated in the crossover 
operations to systematically select the better 
genes to achieve crossover, and consequently 
enhance the genetic algorithms. The detailed 
steps of the HTGA are described in the 
following. The detailed description of the 
Taguchi method can be found in the books 
presented by Taguchi et al. (2000) and Wu 
(2000). Besides, the additional details 
regarding the HTGA can be found in the 
works proposed by Chou and his associates 
(Chou et al., 1998; Tsai et al., 2004).

Design Example 
    In this section, a design example is given 
to illustrate the active vibration controller with 
low trajectory sensitivity design of a simply 
supported flexible beam. Consider a simply 
supported flexible beam which follows the 
configuration of Balas (1978a, 1978b). For 
convenience, the beam parameters (i.e., mass 
per unit length, moment of inertia, modulus of 
elasticity, and length of the beam) are set to be 
unity. The non-collocated actuator and 
displacement sensor are, respectively, 
assumed to be located at the 0.19 and 0.71 
positions (Chou et al., 1998a). In this example, 
we assume that the dominant parameter 
uncertainty of this flexible beam arises from 
the uncertain damping ratio ξ( )t  with 
019.0)(001.0 ≤≤ tξ , due to that many times 
the damping ratios are very hard to measure 
and are not always known to a high degree of 
accuracy (Inman, 1989). That is, in this 
example, we assume that the damping ratio 
)(tξ  is a time-varying interval value. We take 
 as the nominal damping ratio for the 
optimal active vibration controller with low 
trajectory sensitivity design, thus the 
time-varying damping ratio perturbation 
01.0
Δξ( )t  is bounded 009.0)( ≤Δ tξ . In addition, 
in this example, we assume . That is, we 
use a finite-dimensional model having 5 
modes to approximate the original 
infinite-dimensional flexible beam. These five 
frequencies of the simply supported flexible 
beam are , , ,  and 
 rad/sec, respectively. In this design 
example, the first three modes are treated as 
controlled modes, and the fourth and fifth 
modes are treated as known residual modes.
