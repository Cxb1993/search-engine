alluvial valleys.   
 
2 THEORETICAL FORMULATIONS 
2.1 Shallow cases 
Consider an infinitely long, partially filled, alluvial 
valley embedded into a semi-infinite medium (see 
Fig. 1). The valley cross-section is basically 
semi-elliptical in shape, but the sediment is 
horizontally deposited at the bottom. The half-width, 
depth and half-focal length of the valley are a , d  
and b , respectively. The maximum thickness of the 
alluvium is h . The shear modulus, mass density and 
shear wave velocity in the half-space and the deposit 
are given, respectively, by j , j  and jc   
/j j  , j  1, 2. An infinite train of 
unit-amplitude plane SH waves (with angular 
frequency  ) is incident upon this valley at an angle 
  to the x-axis.  
As seen in Fig. 1, the soil-bedrock interface 
divides the half-space into two regions, an open 
region 1 and an enclosed region 2. In these two 
regions, the steady-state out-of-plane motions 1u  
and 2u  are required to satisfy the governing 
Helmholtz equations, namely

where /j jk c  is the shear wave number. The

horizontal ground surface, the curved surfaces of the 
valley, and the top surface of the deposit are

the contribution due to the presence of region 2, can 
be written as

Employing eqs (3), (5) and (6), and distributing a 
chain of points on the semi-elliptic interface between 
two different media gives an infinite system of 
equations. The angular coordinates of 1N  
collocation points along the left- and right-hand 
curved surfaces of the valley are (1)j  and (3)j , 
respectively, while those of 2N  matching points 
along the soil-bedrock interface are (2)j . The total 
number of sampling points on the semi-elliptic arc is 
0N , that is,  0 1 22N N N  .

observed between the present results and those 
shown in Tsaur & Chang (2008, 2009). From a 
computational efficiency viewpoint, the RPMT has 
better performance than the RMT. Hence, only the 
results evaluated by the RPMT are given here. 
Convergence tests must be carried out first to 
determine the total number of collocation points (i.e. 
0N ). Generally, larger 0N  are required as the 
dimensionless frequency and the valley depth 
increase. Take the cases of / 0.7d a   and 
/ 0.5h d   for example; the convergence is achieved 
at 0 28N   for 0.5   and at 0 34N   for 2  .  
In the following subsections, the ‘soft’ cases are of 
primary interest. Furthermore, referring to 
parameters adopted in Lenti et al. (2009), the mass 
density ratio 1 2/   is set at 1.3, and the shear-wave 
velocity ratio 1 2/c c  ranges between 2 and 4. 
 
3.1 Shallow cases 
To demonstrate the effect of wave frequencies   on 
ground motions, the surface displacement 
amplitudes u  against the dimensionless distance 
/x a  for /d a  0.7, /h d  0.5 and 1 2/c c  2 at 
different frequencies (   0.5, 1, 2 and 4) with 
30    are calculated in Fig. 3. As seen in Fig. 3, 
the variability of ground motions becomes chaotic 
(especially for those on the top surface of alluvial 
layer) as the wave frequency   increases.  
Fig. 4 shows the influence of incident angles   on 
the displacement amplitudes for /d a  0.7, 
Fig. 3. Surface motions versus /x a  for / 0.7d a 
and / 0.5h d   with 1 2/ 2c c   at 30   .
Fig. 4. Surface motions versus /x a  for / 0.7d a 
and / 0.25h d   with 1 2/ 2c c   at 1  . 
Fig. 5. Surface motions versus /x a  for / 0.7d a 
with 1 2/ 2c c   at 2   and 60   . 
Fig. 6. Surface motions versus /x a  for / 0.7d a 
and / 0.25h d   at 2   and 60   . 
  –8–
3.2 Deep cases 
Fig. 7 gives the influence of incident angles   on 
the displacement amplitudes for /d a  2, /h d   
0.25 and 1 2/c c 2 at 0   , 30 , 60  and 90  with 
  1. From Fig. 7, symmetric pattern can be 
observed for 90   . The increase of   enhances 
the amplification of motions on the upper surface of 
the alluvium.  
To reveal the effect of wave frequencies   on 
ground motions, the surface displacement 
amplitudes against the dimensionless distance for 
/d a  2, /h d  0.5 and 1 2/c c  2 at different 
frequencies (  0.5, 1, 2 and 4) with 30    are 
computed in Fig. 8. As shown in Fig. 8, motion 
patterns on the left-hand HGS and the top surface of 
alluvial layer become more complex when the 
dimensionless frequency increases.  
Fig. 9 displays the effect of the velocity contrast on 
the responses of lowly filled ( / 0.25h d  ) valleys 
for /d a  2 at  2 and 60   . From Fig. 9, one 
can see that the value of the maximum response 
amplitude decreases with decreasing value of the 
shear-wave velocity ratio. The oscillatory motion 
patterns on the left-hand HGS are very similar. The 
maximum amplifaction can be up to about 8 times 
that of free-field response.  
To examine the influence of dimensionless 
alluvium thicknesses /h d  on ground motions, the 
surface displacement amplitudes for various 
thicknesses ( /h d 0, 0.25, 0.5 and 1) with 1 2/c c 2 
at /d a  2,  2 and 60    are given in Fig. 10. 
As illustrated in Fig. 10, the maximum response for 
the empty case is apparently smaller than those for 
the partially and fully filled cases.  
 
4 CONCLUSION 
A novel application of the region-matching 
technique, connected with the addition theorem for 
Mathieu functions, to the half-plane scattering 
problem of plane SH waves has been proposed. A 
series solution for the case of partially-filled 
semi-elliptic alluvial valleys has been derived 
completely. The MSV in elliptic coordinates has 
been used to get suitable wavefunctions. To enhance 
the computational efficiency of the derived series 
solution, the alternative region-point-matching 
technique has been employed. Both the shallow and 
deep cases have been considered. For two types of 
degenerate cases, there has been good consistency 
between the present results and those in the literature. 
Steady-state variations in ground surface motions 
have been evaluated and analyzed. Results proposed 
herein are intrinsically important because they not 
only enrich the list of geometries of alluvial valleys, 
but also provide challenging criteria for the 
validation of frequency-domain numerical codes. 
Based on the theoretical treatment presented herein, 
other more general types of partially-filled 
semi-elliptic alluvial valleys will constitute the 
topics of investigations, and their solutions may be 
developed in the future.
