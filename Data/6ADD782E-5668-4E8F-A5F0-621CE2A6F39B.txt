(一) 前言 
 
It has been a trend that every government in 
the world is working towards a target of 
considerably increasing the amount of renewable 
energy sources in order to reduce the adverse 
environmental impact of energy use. In fact, 
several energy policy initiatives and programs 
have been proposed to encourage use of 
renewable resources, such as wind power, 
micro-hydro, solar photo-voltaic, landfill gas, 
biomass generation and fuel cell. In Taiwan, 
depending on the energy resources policy of the 
government, the installation of distributed 
generation capacity from renewable sources is 
expected to go up fast in the near future. Clearly, 
if such a large capacity of embedded distributed 
generation is to be connected to the conventional 
distribution network, the operation of the 
distribution network will have to be altered 
radically and the role of the distribution network 
operators (DNO) expanded considerably. 
Theoretically, the connection of embedded DG to 
a distribution network faces many challenges. 
This is because the commercial as well as 
technical operating and planning frameworks 
within which distribution systems are presently 
managed are not yet conceived with DG effects in 
mind. Using the old practice significantly limits 
the amount of DG that can be connected. For 
example, it is well known that the connection of 
embedded DG in rural networks is usually limited 
by the voltage rise effect. In order to minimize the 
overall effect of DG, network operators prefer to 
connect DG at higher voltages where their impact 
on voltage levels is minimal. However, the 
commercial viability of DG projects is sensitive to 
connection costs. These costs increase 
considerably with the voltage level at which the 
DG is connected; generally the higher the voltage, 
the higher the cost. The developers of DG 
therefore prefer to connect at lower voltages. This 
conflict of objectives between DG developers and 
network operators is usually settled through 
simple deterministic load flow studies, usually 
based on one critical case representing conditions 
of minimum load and maximum DG output. The 
worst case scenario approach is based on the 
assumption that no actions can be taken to control 
the voltage rise caused by generation from DG 
sources (the passive distribution network 
philosophy). 
In Taiwan, most electric power generation is 
still centralized in large-scale units and delivered 
to end users with long distant transmission lines at 
high voltage levels and bulky distribution systems. 
Although there are a number of operating 
advantages in using such high-capacity power 
networks, there are also many vital disadvantages; 
e.g., high-level pollutions, low efficiency in 
energy conversions, low reliability of power 
supplying and lacking of flexibility in system 
control. To eliminate some of the above 
shortcomings, it has been commonly believed that 
the distributed generation systems, which have the 
advantages of high flexibility, multifunctional and 
low impact on the environment can be 
interconnected to possible points in the electric 
power distribution systems. Based on this 
development, it is now a crucial need to seriously 
consider the efficiency and flexibility of the 
possible control strategies and the related power 
interfaces as well as the means to reduce the 
influences (impacts) on power quality and 
stability issues when the distributed generation 
systems with various energy resources are 
introduced to the conventional electric power 
distribution systems. In recent years, some 
researchers have already studied the influence of 
distributed generation systems on voltage 
deviations and other related issues [l-2] and 
shown that the effective use of right systems with 
proper control algorithms can greatly improve the 
flexibility, efficiency and power quality problems 
of an electric power distribution system.

commercialization. As a result, new, simple, low 
cost and practical control methods for connecting 
distributed generation systems to the grid are 
necessary.  
In the control issues related to distribution 
systems, the function of reactive power 
compensation is a vital task, especially when a 
large amount of wind power is used. Reactive 
current increases the distribution system losses, 
reduces the active power capability, lowers the 
system power factor, and can even further cause 
large-amplitude variations in the load-side voltage. 
Moreover, fast changes in the reactive power 
consumption of large loads can cause voltage 
amplitude oscillations. This might lead to a 
change in the electric system real power demand 
resulting in power oscillations. It is also well 
known that the main objective of DG systems is to 
provide active power. Nonetheless, by means of 
power electronic devices, reactive power and 
other power quality problems can be resolved at 
the same time. In other words, besides supplying 
the real power the power interface of the DG 
system should be able to provide additional 
functionality of active power filters.  On the 
other hand, during the last decade a number of 
control devices under the term FACTS technology 
[9-14] which are suitable for this application have 
been proposed and implemented.  
 
(四) 研究方法 
 
z Active Management Methods 
 
A. Method 1 
 
Active power generation curtailment 
(shedding) can be used as a means of reducing the 
voltage rise effect during some periods. The 
generator may find it profitable to curtail some of 
its output for limited periods if a larger capacity is 
thus allowed to connect. This may be particularly 
suitable for DG, as the generation curtailment is 
likely to be required during times of relatively low 
value of energy (such as summer nights). 
 
 
B. Method 2: 
 
   Means for absorbing reactive power can also 
be beneficial for controlling the voltage rise effect, 
especially in weak overhead networks with 
embedded generation. In this respect, the use of a 
reactive compensation facility, such as a SVC or 
STATCOM, installed at the DG connection point 
is discussed in [l-2]. However, reactive power 
management has not been investigated as a means 
of increasing the penetration of embedded DG 
generation. In practical applications, an advanced 
optimal power flow method can be used to 
illustrate the potential of reactive power 
management. 
 
C. Method 3: 
 
The introduction of a coordinated voltage 
control policy may be a beneficial action from the 
point of view of DG penetration level. Present 
voltage control in distribution networks is 
primarily carried out by on load tap changing 
transformers (OLTC). Voltage control is usually 
based on a simple constant voltage policy or a 
scheme that takes into account circuit loading 
while determining the voltage that should be 
maintained. It is important to bear in mind that 
this voltage control policy was designed for 
passive networks with strictly unidirectional 
power flows. In active distribution networks with 
multi-directional power flows, the validity of this 
local control voltage practice becomes inherently 
inadequate. In fact, this practice limits the degree 
of openness and accessibility of distribution 
networks and therefore has considerable adverse 
impact on the amount of generation that can be 
accommodated. On the other hand, alternative 
voltage control practices that go beyond the 
present local voltage control, such as area-based 
control of OLTC are considered and the benefits 
of such policies are quite obvious.

−≈ +                  (5) 
  
However, in a more complex network, the 
value of the voltage, and the corresponding tap 
position of the OLTC, would have to be optimized. 
These three methods of regulating voltage can 
also be applied in combination. It should also be 
noted that reinforcing the system could also 
enhance the amount of DG generation that can be 
accommodated. 
 
z Design of MPFC controllers 
 
Current controlled voltage source inverter 
(VSI) is normally used for interfacing between 
shunt-type DG and distribution networks. The 
command signals for the VSI, which are current 
signals in nature, will include the information of 
active power supplied from DG system and 
reactive power required to compensate the voltage 
fluctuation at load-side and also harmonic currents 
if required. To allow for unity power factor at the 
PCC, current controlled VSI was selected for this 
function for its fast dynamic response, accurate 
performance, ease of implementation and its 
inherent closed loop control for current to 
guarantee the required operating point.  The 
current control techniques of VSI used in this 
project is based on analysis of voltage and current 
vector components in a special reference frame. 
To decompose voltage and current components in 
a rotating reference frame, calculation of 
instantaneous angle of voltage or current is 
needed. To obtain this angle, phase-locked loop 
(PLL) is commonly used in voltage source 
inverter's control loop. However, employing phase 
locked loop has some disadvantages such as 
problems due to synchronization of DG with the 
grid and elimination of a wide range of 
frequencies which is not favorable in DG's 
applications as an active power filter. In addition, 
the PLL is very sensitive to noises and 
disturbances. 
To solve this problem, in this project, the 
synchronization algorithm uses the instantaneous 
angle of load voltage calculated directly by 
decomposing voltage vector components in a 
rotating reference frame. Removing PLL from 
control circuit of voltage source inverter presents 
a new control method in this application case. In 
this control strategy, synchronization problems 
will be resolved and dynamic response of DG can 
be improved. The proposed control technique can 
provide load active power, compensate load 
reactive power and track rapid variations in load 
harmonic currents. In addition to these 
characteristics, the proposed MPFC shown in Fig. 
2 and Fig. 3 can also compensate load voltage 
sags.
