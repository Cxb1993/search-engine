人形機器人的面部情緒分析與仿生技術工藝往往是高階關鍵的研究瓶頸項目。本子計
劃第一年的計畫即著眼於以導絡工藝技術（craftsmanship）的觀點取代傳統工程技術的觀點
來製作人形機器人之頭部仿生機構與顏面動力學。一般而言，以目前國內外大學研究所已
經開發的人形機器人的面部情緒仿生技術而言，大多是以 RC-伺服馬達、單晶片… 等傳統
面部工程控制技術，來模擬人形機器人面部的七種靜態表情，然而對於動態的情緒表情，
傳統工程技往往就出現差之毫釐，失之千里之的缺憾。究其真正的原因可以發現，人類的
外型與生物感測器理論上皆可模仿，而人類面部情緒的特質是無法模仿的。爰此，本子計
劃針對於新一代智慧型人形機器人、目前已經成功完成的工作項目包括形機器人的面部情

英文摘要
Most of the developing robot head are in the preliminary and secondary stages and aimed to
facial control and inventive mechanism. However, the head craftsmanship of advanced stage
confronts the research bottleneck of the fabrication difficulties. This is the primary motivation
and scenario of the research work of the proposed sub-project 6. The subproject will be
dedicated to self-fabricate a head skull on the viewpoint of ryodoraku craftsmanship instead of
traditionally engineering viewpoint in the 1st scheduled year. Many institutes have developed
robot heads using the RC-servomotor and sigle-chip controllers. However, they are still obscure
in the craftsmanship of the dynamic expressions with realistic scenarios. We have found that the
human features and biologic sensor can be emulated except their emotional characteristics
theoretically. The head mechanics includes jar module, artificial skin module, artificial muscle
module, and face-color module, etc. will be accomplished by the teamwork of Hwa Hsia Institute
of Technology within the next year.

self-fabricated android robot head in the laboratory. What makes and how to make a robot
head appear human-like scenario? It is mentioned in researches that the presence of
features are the total number of features, and the dimensions of the head.
Fig.1 (a) technique complexity of the humanoid head issues, (b) technique integration of six sub-projects.
2. The Purpose of Research:
Generally speaking, the purpose of the proposed research is to fabricate a complete
architecture of the robot head, which consists of seven basic facial emotions with at least 24DOF.
Some android robots head include the CCD or CMOS video in artificial eyes with PC-based
wireless transmission and image processing. We have tried to build a computer-driven, life-size,
android robot head with video-camera eyes. They consist of 4-6 servomotors controlling neck
spins; eyeballs move horizontally and vertically, eyelids opens or closes. The technique
complexity of the humanoid head issues is illustrated in Fig.1 (a). The problems of the robot head
dynamics can be categorized as facial scenario, artificial skin, biomimetic actuators, emotional
sensors, and. artificial intelligent controller, etc. However, some researchers also found the most
sensitive perception organs that can influence are nose, eyelids and mouth. In fact, the modulized
design can also reconfigure face parts and create different scenarios for variables in a variety of
experiments. The head craftsmanship of advanced stage confronts the research bottleneck of the
fabrication difficulties. This is the primary motivation and scenario of the research work of the
proposed sub-project 6. The subproject will be dedicated to self-fabricate a head skull on the
viewpoint of ryodoraku craftsmanship instead of traditionally engineering viewpoint in the 1st
scheduled year.
3. Paper Review:
The purpose of developing the anthropomorphous emotions of the humanoid robot is aimed
to enrich the lifestyle and the passionate scenario for the next generation of the human kind.
Generally speaking, facial emotions of the robot can be classified into the cartoon-like abstraction,

good electric conductivity and enacted qi-field of the meridian in traditional Chinese medicine
[10,11]. The trajectories are called ryodoraku meridian and acted as the specific modes beneath
the artificial skin on the robot, which were devised by Prof. Nakatani Yoshio, physiological
professor of Kyoto University, Japan in 1956. In figure 1, the developing history of the head skull
and the facial dynamics of the humanoid robot are shown in the age of 1980-2008 [10,11].
However, most of them seem too complicate and too expensive to self-fabricate in a small-size
college laboratory without too much financial aid.
4. Research Methodology:
The research methology of facial dynamics of lip, eye-lid, eyebrows, and cheek have been
demonstrated to be a significant perception of emotions and identity. In Asian counties, it also
considered as the symbolic philosophy in the analysis of meridians of Chinese traditional
medicine. In Fig. 3 (a), a 2nd order tensor analysis for the facial dynamic scenario is shown in
traditional 2D photographs with 16x16 resolution) 2D mesh analysis. Based on the assumption of
tensor invariant, the strain characteristics of the elasticity of flexible material will follow the
principal directions of tension or compression. Thus we can construct a series of tensile trajectory
along the facial meridians on the robot head to bio-imitate the humanoid emotions. Detailed
investigations of the 3rd order tensor analysis include the 3D strains vertical to the facial plane
along the robot head.

1. Introduction：
The 2009 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent
Mechatronics (AIM 2009) was held on July 14-17, 2009 in Suntec International
Convention and Exhibition Center, Singapore. The theme of the conference is
"Mechatronics for Everyday Lives", reflecting the growing importance of mechatronic
technology close to our daily living, not just in the factories. Singapore is an island state
located at the southernmost tip of the Malaysian Peninsula in South East Asia. It is
well-known for being one of the most well organized, efficient countries in the world,
with a high standard of living and an excellent skyline by the water. The whole island can
be accessed by public transportations within an hour at anywhere in the city. general chair
of the 2009 IEEE/ASME (AIM2009) is I-Ming Chen, Nanyang Tech Univ, Singapore,
general co-chair is Bin Yao, Purdue Univ, USA. The other important scholars include the
program chair, Marcelo H. Ang Jr, Nat'l Univ Singapore, program co-chairs George Chiu,
Purdue Univ, USA, Shigeo Hirose, Tokyo Inst. Tech., Japan, Tong Heng Lee, Nat'l Univ,
Singapore, Claudio Melchiorri, Univ of Bologna, Italy, and Jun-Ho Oh, KAIST, Korea.
2. Conference Schedule:
The technique integration of six different sub-projects is illustrated in Fig.2 (b). In this
sub-project, most head architecture will be developed by itself independently. While, the facial
theories of the artificial skin, the facial/skull mechanics, and actuator drivers will be technique
integrated with the 1st, the 2nd, and the 3rd sub-projects, respectively. In other words, the issue of
facial dynamics will be enacted independently in the sixth sub-project. Thus, this sub-project will
be focused on the theoretical derivation, computer simulations, experiments, and realistic
implementation of the facial dynamics on a self-fabricated android robot head in the laboratory.
What makes and how to make a robot head appear human-like scenario? It is mentioned in
researches that the presence of features are the total number of features, and the dimensions of the
head.
In figure1, it shows the conference scheduling of the2009 IEEE/ASME International
Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM 2009), which was held on July 14-17,
2009 in Suntec International Convention and Exhibition Center, Singapore. The project inspector
