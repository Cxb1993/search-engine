polarization efficiency and the extinction ratio of the emerging light from the light guide. 
Rays incident on the light guide surface with different radial and azimuthal angle, especially 
skew rays, could emerge with polarization component perpendicular to the desired linear 
polarization. For LCD application, a pre-polarizer will be required to clean up those undesired 
polarization component for maintaining the contrast, hence a reduction of light utilization 
efficiency. This paper investigates the polarization efficiency and extinction ratio of the solid 
light guide plate patterned with layered subwavelength nanostructure composed of parallel or 
cross stacking of one-dimensional dielectric and metallic stripe, with the consideration of rays 
with all radial and azimuthal angles over the whole hemisphere. As manufacturability for 
large size application is one of the major issues, the feature size of the subwavelength 
nanostructure will be chosen to meet the constrain of interference lithography for making the 
mold for nano-imprint process [8], which is potentially available for large size fabrication. 
 
2. Layered subwavelength nanostructure on solid light guide plate 
A one-dimensional layered subwavelength nanostructure on solid light guide plate is shown in 
Fig. 1. The light guide has the material of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). The first layer of 
nanostructure has the same material as that of the light guide, and the second layer being 
Aluminum (Al). For the parallel stacking configuration as shown in Fig 1(a), the two 
subwavelength nanostructure are perfectly aligned, which can be fabricated with coating Al 
metallic layer onto the light guide plate firstly and then patterning the desired nanostructure 
with nano-imprint process, where the mold tip penetrate into the light guide with the depth of 
the first nanostructure layer. The imprint process might leave some residual metallic material 
on the side wall of the first nanostructure layer, which needs etching process for cleaning up. 
The layered nanostructure can also be made with imprinting two subwavelength nanostructure 
separately, and flip-bond together with reverse contact [9, 10], which has the advantage of low 
aspect ratio or depth-to-width ratio for the imprint process. However, the alignment of two 
nanostructure layer with tolerance down to subwavelength scale will become a challenging 
issue. One other way to stack two nanostructure layers is to flip-bond in crossing 
configuration, as shown in Fig 1(b), by using reverse contact as well, where only the angular 
alignment with larger tolerance is required.

The polarization dependent transmittance versus incident angle at 450nm, 550nm and 650nm 
for parallel and cross stacking configurations are shown in Fig 3 and Fig 4 respectively. Both 
configurations show high transmittance only for TM polarization at low incident angle below 
40o, and therefore most TM polarization with large incident angle and TE polarization at all 
incident angle will keep propagating in the light guide, until it becomes rotated into TM 
polarization by polarization converter and/or turned into low incident angle by extraction 
pattern underneath the light guide. In addition, both configurations show high polarization 
efficiency and extinction ratio due to the transmittance of TE mode at all incident angle being 
as low as to the scale of 0.01%, which means the emerging light from the light guide surface 
will be highly polarized. The performance at 450nm is relatively worse among the three 
wavelengths for both parallel and cross configurations, which can be improved with shorter 
period of the nanostructure [3]

4. Polarization efficiency and extinction ratio with skew rays 
The polarization efficiency and extinction ratio, derived from Fig 3 and Fig 4 is only valid for 
principal rays in the light guide. In fact, the majority are skew rays which incident on the light 
guide surface from different radial angle?and azimuthal angle?as shown in Fig 5. A high 
overall polarization efficiency and extinction ratio rely on the polarization of emerging light

where η// and η⊥ represent the percentage of transmitting power of P⊥ contributed to Φ//I-plane 
and Φ⊥I-plane respectively. The total incident power has been normalized, and therefore P// and 
P⊥ each takes 0.5 unit power. η// and η⊥ can be geometrically evaluated with Fig 5, where P⊥ is 
decomposed into two orthogonal components, one parallel to I-plane and the other one 
perpendicular, and the power of each component take the percentage of η// and η⊥ respectively 
from the overall transmitting power of P⊥ component, which can be calculated with eq(5)~(7)  
η// = 2cos α          (5) 
η⊥= 2sin α          (6) 
cos sin sinα θ ϕ=         (7) 
With the sequence of evaluating (T//, T⊥) with RCWA first, then (η//, η⊥) and (Φ//I-plane , 
Φ⊥I-plane) with eq(3)~(7) for different radial and azimuthal angle at an interval of 1 degree, the 
polar diagram of Φ//I-plane and Φ⊥I-plane can be made. Fig 6 and Fig 7 shows the polar plot of 
Φ//I-plane and Φ⊥I-plane at wavelength 450nm, 550nm and 650nm for the case of parallel and 
cross stacking configurations respectively. The radial angle has been plotted up to 60 degree 
only. It shows that the extinction ratio and polarization efficiency for both configurations are 
high for the rays with small azimuthal angle where Φ⊥I-plane is low, but will decrease with 
increasing azimuthal angle. Assuming the incident light from different radial and azimuthal 
angle have the same power, the overall polarization efficiency and extinction ratio of parallel 
and cross stacking configuration for wavelength at 450nm, 550nm and 650nm can be 
evaluated, and are listed in Table 3.

display application, the weighting of blue primary is lower than that of red and green, and 
therefore higher overall extinction ratio can be expected from integrating all three primaries 
with associated weighting. In addition, Table 4 shows a better performance on overall 
extinction ratio for longer wavelength in general, which indicates potential improvement 
could be made with reducing the period of nanostructure upon the feasibility of large area 
fabrication process.

6. Conclusion 
Subwavelength nanostructure composed of layered one-dimensional dielectric and metallic 
stripe stacked in parallel or cross configuration on the surface of a solid plate have shown an 
overall polarization efficiency higher than 98% for wavelength at visible band, which makes 
the solid plate perform as a high efficiency polarized light guide. In addition, both 
configurations exhibit overall extinction ratio above 1,000 within a specific range of light 
incident angle. Accompanying with proper light extraction pattern and polarization converter, 
a polarizer free backlight illumination optics is even achievable for LCD application.
