inclination angle beta = 50, 60, 70 and 80 degree, 
the distributions of active earth pressure are not 
linearly with depth. On the lower part of the model 
wall, the measured horizontal pressure is lower than 
Coulomb｀s prediction. (3) For beta = 50 to 80 
degree, the active earth pressure coefficient Ka,h 
decreases with  increasing interface inclination 
angle. The point of application of the active thrust 
moves a location slight higher than h/H = 0.333. (4) 
For beta = 50 to 80 degree, the nearby inclined rock 
face would actually increase the factor of safety 
(FS) against sliding of the wall. The evaluation of 
FS against sliding with Coulomb＇s theory would be on 
the safe side. (5) For beta = 50 to 80 degree, the 
intrusion of an inclined rock face into the active 
wedge would increase the FS against overturning of 
the retaining wall. The evaluation of FS against 
overturning with Coulomb｀s theory would also be on 
the safe side.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
The NCTU model retaining wall facility was modified to study the effects of an 
adjacent inclined rock face on active earth pressure. A steel interface plate simulating 
the rock face was designed contracted. A top supporting beam, and a base supporting 
block was constructed to support the steel interface plate. Air-dry Ottawa sand was 
used as backfill material. For a loose backfill, the soil was placed behind the wall with 
air-pluviaiton method to achieve a relative density of 35%.  
 
The main parameter considered for this study is the rock face inclination angles  = 
0°, 50°, 60°, 70° and 80° as illustrated in Fig.1. The height of the wall H = 0.5 m. The 
variation of lateral earth pressure was measured with the soil pressure transducers 
(SPT) on the surface of the model wall. Based on experimental results, the 
distribution of earth pressure on the retaining wall adjacent an inclined rock face can 
be obtained. It is hoped that the findings of this study would provide valuable 
information for the geotechnical engineer to design the retaining structure near a 
inclined rock face more safely and more efficiently.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW 
 
It is common to all the theories that the soil mass be in a state of limiting equilibrium, and 
shear strength of the soil be expressed in terms of the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion. 
However, they differ in the assumption about the shape of the failure surface. For example, 
Coulomb (1776) assumed that sliding occurs along a planar sliding surface. The method 
developed by Brinch Hansen (1953) assumed the soil wedge slip along a circular surface. 
Janbu’s theory (1957) is not restricted to a particular shape of slip surface, but makes use of 
the method of slices and satisfied equilibrium in approximate manner. Terzaghi’s general 
wedge theory (1941) is based on logarithmic spiral slip surface. 
 
The coefficient of active earth pressure Ka computed from various theories was compared 
by Morgenstern and Eisenstein (1970). Fig. 2 shows the variation of Ka as a function of 
internal friction angle  of backfill, where the wall friction angleδis equal to  and /2. For 
the case /2, the total range of variation of Ka is generally less than 15% from Rankine’s 
solution. In this study, Ka values estimated with the Coulomb theory are compared with 
experiment results. 
 
Fan and Chen (2006) used the non-linear finite element program PLAXIS to investigate 
the earth pressure from the at-rest to the active condition for a rigid wall close to an inclined 
rock face. In Fig. 3 the wall used for analysis is 5 m high, the back of the wall is vertical, 
and the surface of the backfill is horizontal. To investigate the influence of the adjacent rock 
face on the behavior of earth pressure, the inclination angle  of the rock face and the 
spacing d between the wall and the foot of the rock face were the parameters for numerical 
analysis. The wall was prevented from any movement during the placing of the fill. After the 
filling process, active wall movement was allowed until earth pressure behind the wall 
reached the active condition. The wall was assumed to be rigid. Fig. 4 shows the finite 
element mesh, which has been examined to eliminate the influence of size effect and 
boundary effects. The finite element mesh consists of 1,512 elements, 3,580 nodes, and 
4,536 stress points. Base on the numerical analysis, the distribution of earth pressure at 
various wall displacements for translational mode (T mode) is shown in Fig. 5. The 
distribution of active earth pressure with depth is non-linear. The calculated active pressure 
is considerably less than that computed using the Coulomb’s theory. 
 
Fig. 6 shows the variation of the active earth pressure coefficient KA computed with finite 
element analysis, as a function of the inclination  of the rock face and rock face-wall 
spacing d, for walls under T mode. The analytical active K values are less than those 
calculated with Coulomb’s solution. The analytical KA value decreased with decreasing  
angle, for  angle less than 30°. Fig. 7 shows the variation of the KA with the  angle at d = 
0 with T, RT (rotation about top) and RB (rotation about base) modes. 
 
Fig. 8 shows the variation of the point of application of the active soil thrust with the  
angle for d = 0. The variation of the h/H value with the  for walls in RB and T modes are 
similar, where h is the vertical distance between the thrust and wall base. For walls in RB and 
T modes, the h/H decreased with increasing  angles, then it leveled off at h/H=0.333 for  
angles greater than about 30°. However, the analytical h/H values were much higher than 
those for RB and T modes.

3. EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS 
 
To study the earth pressure behind retaining structures, the National Chiao Tung University 
(NCTU) has built a model retaining wall facility which can simulate different kinds of wall 
movement. All of the investigations described in this report were conducted in this model 
wall system, which will be carefully discussed in this chapter. The entire system consists of 
the following components: (1) soil bin; (2) model retaining wall; (3) driving system; and (4) 
data acquisition system. The arrangement of the NCTU model retaining wall system is shown 
in Fig. 9. 
 
3.1 Soil Bin 
 
The soil bin is 2,000 mm in length, 1,000 mm in width and 1,000 mm in depth as shown in 
Fig. 10. Both side walls of the soil bin are made of 30 mm-thick transparent acrylic plates, 
through which the behavior of the backfill can be observed. Outside the acrylic plates, steel 
beams and columns are used to confine the side walls to ensure a plane strain condition. 
 
3.2 Model Retaining Wall 
 
The moveable retaining wall and its driving systems are shown in Fig. 9. The retaining 
wall is 1000 mm-wide, 550 mm-high, and 120 mm-thick, and is made of solid steel. The 
retaining wall is vertically supported by two unidirectional rollers and laterally supported by 
the steel frame through the driving system. Two separately controlled wall driving 
mechanism, one at the upper level, and the other at the lower level, provide various kinds of 
lateral wall movements. 
 
A total of 9 earth pressure transducers have been arranged within a narrow central zone to 
avoid the friction that might exist near the side walls of the soil bin as shown in Fig. 12. The 
soil pressure transducers are strain-gage-type transducers (Kyowa PGM-02KG, capacity = 
19.62kN/m2) as shown in Fig. 11. To eliminate the soil arching effect, all soil pressure 
transducers are built quite stiff, and their measuring surfaces are flush with the face of the 
wall as shown in Fig. 13. They provide closely spaced data points for determining variation 
of the earth pressure distribution with depth. 
 
3.3 Driving System 
 
To achieve different modes of wall movement, two sets of driving rods are attached to the 
model wall. The upper driving rods are located 230 mm below the top of the wall, and the 
lower rods are located 236 mm below the upper rods as shown in Fig. 14. Two driving motors 
(ELECTRO, M-4621AB) supply the thrust to the upper and the lower driving rods 
independently. The wall speed and movement modes are controlled by the automatic motor 
speed control system (DIGILOK, DLC-300) shown in Fig. 15. By setting the same motor 
speed for the upper and lower driving rods, a translation mode can be achieved for the model 
wall test. 
 
3.4. Data Acquisition System   
 
Due to the considerable amount of data collected by the soil pressure transducers and 
displacement transducers, a data acquisition system shown in Fig. 16 was used for this study.

4. Interface Plate and Supporting System 
 
4.1 Interface Plate 
 
The steel plate is 1.370 m-long, 0.998 m-wide, and 5 mm-thick as shown in Fig. 18. The 
unit weight of the steel plate is 76.52 kN/m3 and its total mass is 53.32 kg (0.523 kN). A layer 
of anti-slip material (Safety-walk, 3M) is attached on the steel plate to simulate the friction 
that acts between the backfill and rock face as illustrated in Fig. 18 (c) and Fig. 19 (a). For the 
inclination angle= 50o shown in Fig. 1, the length of the interface plate should be at least 
1.370 m. On the other hand, the inside width of the soil bin of the NCTU retaining wall 
facility is 1 m. To put the interface plate into the soil bin, the width of the steel plate has to 
less than 1.0 m. As a result, the steel plate was designed to be 1.370 m-long and 0.998 
m-wide. 
 
Section of the steel L-beam (30 mm x 30 mm x 3 mm) was chosen as the reinforced 
material. On top of the interface plate, a 65 mm x 65 mm x 8 mm steel L-beam was welded to 
reinforce the connection between the plate and the hoist ring shown in Fig. 19 (b). 
 
4.2 Supporting System 
 
In Fig. 20, the top supporting steel beam is placed at the back of the interface plate and 
fixed at the bolt slot of the side wall of the soil bin. Details of top supporting beam are 
illustrated in Fig. 21. The section of supporting steel beam is 65 mm × 65 mm × 8 mm and 
its length is 1,700 mm. Fig. 22 shows four bolt slots were drilled on each side of the U-shape 
steel beam on the side wall of the soil bin. Fig. 23 (b) shows the top supporting beam was 
fixed at the slots with bolts. 
     
The base block used to support the steel interface plate is shown in Fig. 24. The supporting 
block is 1.00 m-long, 0.14 m-wide, and 0.113 m-thick. Fig. 24 (b) shows trapezoid grooves 
were caved to the face of the base supporting block. Fig. 20 shows the foot of the interface 
plate could be inserted into the groove at different distance from the model wall. Different 
horizontal spacing d could be adopted for testing includes: (1) d = 0 mm (2) d = 50 mm and 
(3) d = 100 mm. Fig. 20 shows 6 base boards are placed between the base supporting block 
and the end wall to keep the base block stable. Details of base boards are illustrated in Fig. 25. 
The base board is 1,860 mm-long, 1,002 mm-wide and 113 mm-thick. The surface of the top 
base board was cover with a layer of anti-slip material Safe-Walk.

5. BACKFILL AND INTERFACE CHARACTISTICS 
 
5.1 Backfill Properties 
 
Air-dry Ottawa silica sand (ASTM C-778) was used as backfill. Physical properties of 
Ottawa sand are listed in Table. 1 Grain-size distribution of the backfill is shown in Fig. 
26.To establish the relationship between unit weight  of backfill and its internal friction 
angle , direct shear tests have been conducted. The shear box used has a square (60 mm x 60 
mm) cross-section, and its arrangements are shown in Fig. 27. 
 
Chang (2000) established the relationship between the internal friction angle  and unit 
weight  of the ASTM C-778 Ottawa sand as shown in Fig. 28. It is obvious from the figure 
that soil strength increases with increasing soil density. For the air-pluviated backfill, the 
empirical relationship between soil unit weight  and  angle can be formulated as follows 
 
 
                          = 6.43γ - 68.99                                (5.1)             
 
where 
 = angle of internal friction of soil (degree) 
γ = unit weight of backfill (kN/m3) 
Eqn. (5.1) is applicable for γ= 15.45 ~ 17.4 kN/m3 only. 
 
5.2 Interface Characteristics between Model Wall and Backfill 
 
To evaluate the wall friction angle wbetween the backfill and model wall, special direct 
shear tests have been conducted. A 88 mm x 88 mm x 25 mm smooth steel plate, made of the 
same material as the model wall, was used as the lower shear box. Ottawa sand was placed 
into the upper shear box and vertical load was applied on the soil specimen. The arrangement 
of this test is shown in Fig. 29. 
 
To establish the wall friction angles developed between the steel plate and sand, soil 
specimens with different unit weight were tested. Air-pluviation methods was used to achieve 
different soil densities, and the test result is shown in Fig. 30. For air-pluviation Ottawa sand, 
Lee (1998) suggested the following relationship: 
 
                         w = 2.33- 17.8                                (5.2) 
   
Eqn. (5.2) is applicable for  = 15.5~17.5 kN/m3 only. The  angle and  angle obtained in 
section 5.1 and 5.2 are used for calculation of active earth pressure for Coulomb, and 
Rankine’s theories. 
 
5.3 Side Wall Friction 
 
To constitute a plane strain condition for model wall experiments, the shear stress between 
the backfill and sidewall should be minimized. A lubrication layer fabricated with plastic

6. TEST RESULTS 
 
This chapter reports the experimental results regarding effects of an adjacent inclined rock 
face on the active earth pressure against a retaining wall filled with loose sand. The rock face 
interface inclination angles  = 0o, 50o, 60o, 70o and 80o are illustrated in Fig. 1. 
 
6.1 Earth Pressure Results 
 
6.1.1 Earth Pressure for  = 0° 
 
Distributions of horizontal earth pressure h measured at different stages of wall 
displacements S/H are illustrated in Fig. 39. As the wall started to move, the earth pressure 
decrease, and eventually a limit active pressure was reached. The pressure distributions are 
essentially linear at each stage of wall movement. Active earth pressures calculated with 
Rankine and Coulomb theories are also indicated in Fig. 39. The ultimate experiment active 
pressure distribution is in fairly good agreement with that estimated with Coulomb and 
Rankine theories. 
 
Fig. 40 shows a typical variation of horizontal earth pressure h measured by different 
pressure transducer as a function of the wall movement, S/H (S : wall displacement, H : 
backfill height). In Fig. 40 the horizontal stress decreased with increasing active wall 
movements. The location for soil pressure transducer SPT1 through SPT9 is illustrated in Fig. 
12. If the normal pressures at different depths are normalized by the soil unit weight and its 
depth z, the variation of h/z with S/H is shown in Fig. 41. In this figure, most of the data 
are concentrated. It seems possible that the active condition is reached at all depths 
simultaneously. 
 
The variation of horizontal earth-pressure coefficient Kh as a function of wall 
displacement is shown in Fig. 42. The coefficient Kh is defined as the ratio of the horizontal 
coefficient component of total thrust to 22H . The horizontal thrust Ph was calculated by 
summing the pressure diagram shown in Fig. 39. The coefficient Kh decreased with 
increasing wall movement until a minimum value was reached, then remained approximately 
constant. The ultimate value of Kh is defined as the horizontal active earth-pressure 
coefficient Ka,h. In Fig. 43, the active condition was reached at approximately S/H = 0.0035.  
 
As shown in Fig. 39, the distribution of earth pressure at different wall movements is 
almost linear. Therefore, the point of application of total thrust, h/H should remained at about 
H/3 above the wall base. Experimental results in Fig. 43 show that these points are located at 
a distance of about 0.331 H ~ 0.359 H above the wall base. 
 
For Test 0825, the distributions of earth pressure at different stages of wall movement are 
shown in Fig. 44. As the wall starts to move, the earth pressure decrease. The pressure 
distribution is approximately linear with depth. Although the distribution is not strictly linear, 
such an assumption would not be far from reality. 
 
In Fig. 42, the earth pressure coefficient, Kh decreases with increasing wall movement 
and finally a constant total thrust is reached. For Test 0825, the active condition occurred at 
the wall movement of approximately S/H= 0.003. It may be observed from Fig. 42 that 
 36
 
For  = 60°, the variation of earth pressure Kh with wall movement is shown in Fig. 54. 
The earth-pressure coefficient value Kh decreased with increasing wall movement until a 
constant value is reached. In Fig. 54 the active condition was reached at approximately at 
S/H = 0.003. Referring to Fig. 51, at S/H = 0.003 the active earth pressures measured near 
the base portion of the wall is much lower than Coulomb’s prediction. The measured active 
earth pressure is clearly affected by the interface plate inclined at  = 60°. It is reasonable to 
expect the point of application of the active thrust would be located at a position higher than 
h/H = 0.333. Fig. 55 shows the experiment points of application the active thrusts were 
located at about 0.40H ~ 0.43H above the wall base. 
 
For Test 0818, Fig. 54 shows the pressure distribution at various movement stages. The 
measured active earth pressure was lower than Coulomb’s solution especially the pressure 
measured near the base of wall. This is most probably because the active earth pressure is 
affected by the intrusion of the inclined rock face. 
 
6.1.4 Earth Pressure for  =70° 
 
The pressure distributions at various wall movements for  =70° are shown in Fig. 57. At 
S/H = 0, the measured earth pressure at rest was lower than Jaky’s prediction, especially at 
the lower part of the model wall. This is because the interface plate is very close to the soil 
pressure transducers. 
 
Fig. 58 shows the variation of horizontal earth pressure h measured by different pressure 
transducer as a function of the wall movement. It is clear from the data shown in Fig. 59 that 
the horizontal stress decreases with increasing active wall movements. The variation of h/z 
with S/H is shown in Fig. 59. 
 
Fig. 60 shows the variation of Kh with active wall movement for  = 70°. The coefficient 
Kh decreases with increasing wall movement. The wall movement needed for Kh to reach an 
active state is about S/H = 0.0035. 
 
The variation of the location of to the active soil thrust with wall movement is shown in 
Fig. 61.Without the interface plate ( = 0°), the point of application h/H of the earth resultant 
is located at about 0.33H above the base of the wall. With the interface angle  = 70°, the 
earth pressure does not increase linearly with depth. This active earth pressure distribution 
shown in Fig. 57 causes the location of the total thrust to rise to a higher location. 
Experimental result in Fig. 61 shows the point of application of the active thrust was located 
at about 0.41H ~ 0.43H above the wall base. 
 
Fig. 62 illustrates the distributions of earth pressure at different stages of wall movement 
for Test 0824. The active earth pressure measured near the base of the wall was much lower 
than Coulomb solution. In Fig. 60 and Fig. 61, data points obtained form Test 0822 and Test 
0824 indicate that experimental results were in good agreement. 
 
6.1.5 Earth Pressure for  =80° 
 
Fig. 63 shows the variation of the earth pressure distributions with depth at various wall 
 38
6.2.1 Magnitude of Active Soil Thrust 
 
The variation of active earth pressure coefficient Ka,h as a function of interface inclination 
angle  is shown in Fig. 72. For comparison purposes, the analytical results reported by Fan 
and Chen (2006) are also plotted in Fig. 72. Without the interface plate (= 0°), the 
coefficient Ka,h values is in fairly good agreement with Coulomb’s prediction. However, with 
the intrusion of the rock face into the active soil wedge, the coefficient Ka,h decrease with 
rock face inclination angle  Although the tend was the same, the experimental Ka,h was 
much lower than the numerical Ka,h values. 
 
6.2.2 Point of Application of Active Soil Thrust 
 
Fig. 73 shows the variation of the point of application of active soil thrust with the  angle. 
For the  = 0°, no rock face was near the retaining wall, the (h/H)a value is located at about 
0.33H above the base of the wall. As the interface angle  increase, the earth pressure 
measured near the base of the wall decreased. This change of earth pressure distribution 
causes the active total thrust to move to a slightly higher location as shown in Fig. 73. For  
= 80°, the point of application of the active soil thrust is located at 0.425H above the base of 
the wall. 
 
6.3 Design Considerations 
 
In the design of a retaining structure, it is often necessary to check its adequacy. It is 
interesting to investigate how would the nearby inclined rock-face influence, the factor of 
Safety (FS) against sliding and overturning of the retaining wall. 
 
6.3.1 Factor of Safety against Sliding 
 
The factor of safety for sliding is defined as： 
 
    Resisting  Force 
Driving  Forcesliding
FS                                          (6.1) 
 
For the retaining wall shown in Fig. 35, the driving force comes from the active earth 
pressure acting on the face of the wall. Fig. 72 indicates, for  greater than 50°, the horizontal 
component of active soil thrust ,a hP  would decrease with increasing  angle. In Fig. 72 with 
the intrusion of the inclined rock face into the active soil wedge (50° to 80°), the driving 
force acting on the wall would decrease to a value low than Coulomb’s estimation. In 
equation 6.1, if the driving force on the wall is reduced, the FS against sliding would increase. 
The intrusion of the inclined rock face would actually increase the FS against sliding of the 
wall. The evaluation of FS against sliding with Coulomb’s theory would be on the safe side. 
 
6.3.2 Factor of Safety against overturning  
 
The factor of safety against overturning of the retaining wall is defined as:

7. CONCLUSIONS 
 
    In this report, the effects of a nearby inclined rock face on the active earth against a rigid 
retaining wall are investigated. Based on the test results, the following conclusions are drawn. 
 
1. Without the Stiff interface (= 0o), the active earth pressure coefficient Ka,h is in good 
agreement with Coulomb’s equation. The point of application h/H of the active soil thrust is 
located at about 0.33H above the base of the wall. 
2. For the interface inclination angle  = 50o, 60o, 70o and 80o, the distributions of active 
earth pressure are not linearly with depth. On the lower part of the model wall the measured 
horizontal pressure is lower than Coulomb’s solution. 
3. For  = 50o ~ 80o, the active earth pressure coefficient Ka,h decreases with increasing 
interface inclination angle. The point of application of the active total thrust move a location 
slight higher than h/H = 0.333.  
4. For  = 50o ~ 80o, the nearby inclined rock face would actually increase the FS against 
sliding of the wall. The evaluation of FS against sliding with Coulomb’s theory would be on 
the safe side. 
5. For  = 50o ~ 80o, the intrusion of an inclined rock face into the active soil wedge would 
increase the FS against overturning of the retaining wall. The evaluation of FS against 
overturning with Coulomb’s theory would also be on the safe side.

本研究探討鄰近堅硬岩石面入侵回填土對擋土牆主動土壓力之影
響。本研究以氣乾之渥太華砂為回填土，回填土高及牆高 H 皆為 0.5
公尺。量測於鬆砂(相對密度 Dr = 35%)狀態下，作用於剛性擋土牆的
側向土壓力。本研究利用國立交通大學模型擋土牆設備，探討堅硬
界面以不同傾角侵入回填土，對擋土牆主動土壓力影響。為模擬堅
硬的岩石界面，本研究設計並建造一座鋼製界面板，及其支撐系統。
本研究共執行五種岩石界面與水平面夾角 = 0o、50o、60o、70o 與
80o 五組實驗。依據實驗結果，獲得以下幾項結論。(1).當岩石界面
傾角= 0o 時，其主動土壓力係數 Ka,h 與 Coulomb 解相吻合，其主
動合力作用於距擋土牆底部約 0.33H 處。(2)在岩石界面傾角 45o、
60o、70o 與 80o 狀況下，側向土壓力隨深度的增加而呈非線性分布，
所獲得的側向土壓力低於 Jaky 解，側向土壓力隨界面傾角的增加而
減少。(3)當界面傾角為 50o 至 80o，主動土壓合力隨岩石界面傾角的
增加而逐漸減小。合力作用點的位置稍高於理論值 0.33H。(4)當傾
斜岩石面入侵主動土楔時，造成擋土牆抗滑動之安全係數增加，因
此根據 Coulomb 理論所求解之安全係數會偏向安全。(5)當傾斜岩石
面入侵主動土楔時，使擋土牆抗傾覆之安全係數增加，所以依據
Coulomb 理論所求得之安全係數會趨於安全。

ABSTRACT 
 
This paper studied the effects of an adjacent inclined rock face on the 
at-rest earth pressure acting on a rigid retaining wall. Horizontal earth 
pressures in loose (Dr = 35%) and compacted (Dr = 72%) dry Ottawa 
sand were measured. A steel interface plate with inclination angles 0o, 
45o, 60o, 70o, and 80o were used to simulate the inclined rock face. The 
measured distribution of earth pressure was not linearly with depth, and 
was mostly lower than Jaky’s solution. As the rock face inclination 
angle increased, the magnitude of at-rest soil thrust decreased, and the 
total thrust rose to a higher location. With the inclination angle of 80o, 
only a small amount of sand was filled in the narrow gap between the 
wall and the inclined interface. The vertical stress in the soil slice was 
partially resisted by the friction on the nearby inclined rock face. With 
decreasing vertical stress in the soil mass, the horizontal stress acting 
on the wall decreased.

INTRODUCTION 
 
In this study, the effects of an adjacent inclined rock face on the earth 
pressure at-rest on a rigid retaining wall were investigated. In 
traditional, earth pressure at-rest behind a non-yielding retaining wall 
was estimated with Jaky’s Formula. However, if the retaining wall was 
constructed adjacent to an inclined rock face as shown in Fig. 1, the 
inclined face intruded the cohesionless backfill. In this figure, the rock 
face was excavated behind the bridge abutment, and soil was filled 
between the abutment and the inclined face. The lateral movement of 
the abutment was restrained by the bridge girder at the top and the piles 
below the abutment. The inclination angle between the rock face and 
horizontal is defined as . Under this condition, can the Jaky’s formula 
be used to evaluate the earth pressure at-rest on the abutment wall? 
Would the distribution of earth pressure at-rest still be linear?  
 
The ratio of the horizontal stress h to vertical stress v is defined as the 
coefficient of earth pressure at-rest Ko, or Ko = h / v. Since v = z,

then h= Koz, where  is the unit weight of soil. Mesri and Hayat 
(1993) reported that Jaky (1944) arrived at the relationship (Ko = 1 - 
sin between Ko and the internal friction angle  by analyzing a talus 
of granular soil freestanding at the angle of repose. Mayne and 
Kulhawy (1982) reported that, the approximate theoretical relationship 
for Ko for normally consolidated soils introduced by Jaky appears valid 
for cohesionless soils. Based on their experimental study, Sherif et al. 
(1984) reported that the earth pressure distribution for loose sand was 
in good agreement with Jaky’s equation. 
 
Spangler and Handy (1982) studied the distribution of soil pressure 
against a fascia wall built in front of a stable rock face. Granular 
backfill was placed in the relatively narrow gap between the wall and 
the natural outcrop. Spangler and Handy proposed an equation to 
estimate the lateral soil pressure against the wall. Frydman and Keissar 
(1987) used the centrifuge modeling technique to test a small model 
wall, and the rock face was modeled by a wooden block, which can be 
positioned at varying distances d from the wall. It was reported that 
Spangler and Handy’s solution may be used for estimating lateral 
pressure for the no-movement Ko condition.

were discussed. Air-dry Ottawa sand was used throughout this 
investigation. Physical properties of the soil include Gs = 2.65; emax = 
0.76; emin = 0.50; D60 = 0.39 mm; and D10 = 0.26 mm. For the loose 
fill, the backfill was deposited by air-pluviation from the slit of a 
hopper into the soil bin. Rad and Tumay (1987) reported that pluviation 
is the method that provides reasonably homogeneous specimens with 
desired relative density. The drop distance was approximately 1.5 m to 
the soil surface and the slit opening was 18 mm. The soil unit weight  
achieved with the pluviation method was 15.6 kN/m3, and its relative 
density Dr was 35%. The corresponding internal friction angle  
determined from direct shear tests was 31.3o. 
 
To obtain a dense condition to simulate field conditions, the loose 
backfill was densified with the vibratory compactors. For wide-area 
compaction, the surface of air-pluviated backfill was compacted with 
the 225 mm x 225 mm square vibratory compactor as shown in Fig. 5. 
Each compacted lift was 0.3 m-thick. For compaction in the narrow gap 
between the wall and the interface, the loose sand was compacted with 
the strip vibratory compactor. Each lane was densified with the 
vibratory compactor for a pass of 70 seconds. Fig. 6 illustrated the 
compaction of loose backfill with the 90 mm x 500 mm strip compactor. 
To achieve a similar dense condition, each compacted lift was 0.1 m-
thick. 
 
To observe the distribution of density in the soil sample, density 
measurements were made. The cylindrical density cup was made of 
acrylic with an inner diameter of 100 mm and height of 50 mm. The 
cups were placed in the soil mass at different elevations and locations. 
In Fig. 7, the distribution of relative density for sand compacted with 
the strip compactor was compared with that for sand compacted with 
the square vibratory compactor. The distributions of density obtained 
with two different compactors were in fairly good agreement (Dr = 72 
%), and the density distribution in the soil bin was quite uniform. It 
may be seen in Fig. 7 that the soil density near the surface of fill was 
relatively loose.  
 
D’Appolonia et al. (1969) reported that, due to the lack of confining 
pressure, the soil near the surface may not be dense even after 
compaction 
To simulate a plane-strain condition, the shear stress between the 
backfill and sidewall should be minimized to be nearly frictionless. 
This was accomplished by creating a lubrication layer between the 
sidewalls and the soil. The lubrication layer suggested by Fang et al. 
(2004) consisted of two 0.009-mm thin plastic sheets and a 0.152-mm

thick plastic sheet was used. With the lubrication layer, the sidewall 
friction angle was reduced to approximately 7.5o.  
 
To evaluate the interface friction angle i between the backfill and the 
interface plate, special direct shear tests were conducted. In the test, the 
lower shear box was replaced with a steel plate covered with a layer of 
anti-slip material. The interface friction angle i between Ottawa sand 
and the SAFETY-WALK covered interface plate was found to be 20.7o. 
 
TEST RESULTS FOR LOOSE BACKFILL 
 
The interface inclination angles of rock face  = 0o, 45o, 60o, 70o, and 
80o with the horizontal were illustrated in Fig. 2. A loose backfill (Dr = 
35%) was placed between the wall and the inclined rock face. 
 
Distribution of Earth Pressure at-rest

Point of Application of at-rest Soil Thrust 
 
The point of application h/H of the total soil thrust as a function of the 
 angle was illustrated in Fig. 10. Note h is the vertical distance 
between the total thrust and the base of wall. In the figure, without the 
interface plate ( = 0o), the point of application of the at-rest soil thrust 
was located at about 0.33 H above the base of the wall. As the interface 
angle increased, the earth pressure gradually decreased near the base of 
the wall as seen in Fig. 8. This change of earth pressure distribution 
caused the total thrust to rise to higher locations as shown in Fig. 10. 
For  = 80o, the point of application of the total thrust was located at 
0.55 H above the base of the wall. 
 
TEST RESULTS FOR DENSE BACKFILL 
 
This section reported the experimental results regarding effects of an 
adjacent inclined rock face on the earth pressure against a non-yielding 
wall with compacted backfill. The rock face inclination angle 
considered were α = 0o, 45o, 60o, 70o and 80o. To obtain the expected 
dense condition, the cohesionless backfill was compacted with two 
different vibratory compactors to reach the relative density Dr = 72%, 
and the unit weight of 16.5 kN/m3. Based on the results obtained with 
direct shear tests (Ho, 1999), the corresponding internal friction angle  
for the dense backfill was 40.1o.  
 
Distribution of Earth Pressure at-rest 
 
Fig. 11 showed the distributions of lateral earth pressure against the 
non-yielding wall, after the backfill was compacted in five 0.3 m-thick 
lifts with the square vibratory compactor (see Fig. 5). Before 
compaction, the earth pressure at-rest could be properly estimated with 
Jaky’s equation. After compaction, Fig. 11 showed that for  = 0o an 
extra horizontal stress was induced by compaction at the upper part of 
wall surface. The compaction-influenced zone extended from the 
compacted surface to the depth of approximately 0.7 m. Peck and Mesri 
(1987) reported that the compaction induced lateral pressure near the 
surface was limited by the passive Rankine earth pressure. In Fig. 
11,the lateral stress measured near the top of backfill was almost 
identical to the passive pressure. For more information regarding the 
compaction induced earth pressure, the reader is referred to Chen and 
Fang (2008). However, the lateral stresses measured below the

compaction-influenced zone converged to the earth pressure at-rest 
based on Jaky’s equation.  
 
Fig. 12 showed the distributions of lateral earth pressure for the backfill 
compacted with the strip vibratory compactor (see Fig. 4). The 1.5 m-
thick backfill was compacted in fifteen 0.1 m-thick lifts. The relative 
density of soil obtained was also 72%. For  = 0o, the compaction-
influenced zone extended from the surface to the depth of 
approximately 1.1 m. It was obvious in Fig. 12 that the peak lateral 
earth pressure induced by the strip compactor was higher than that 
induced by the square compactor. It should be mentioned that, to 
achieve the same relative density, the backfill was compacted in 15 lifts 
and each lift was compacted in 15 lanes by the strip compactor. The 
amount of energy input by the strip compactor was much higher than 
that by the square compactor. 
 
Fig. 11 showed the distribution of lateral earth pressure for the dense 
backfill compacted with the square compactor for the rock face 
inclination angles α = 0o, 45o, and 60o. In this Figure, the lateral earth 
pressures measured for α = 45o and 60o were less than Jaky’s solution at 
the lower part of the wall. The magnitude of earth pressure decreased 
with increasing α angle. The compaction-influenced zone extended 
from the surface to the depth of approximately 0.6 m.  
 
Fig. 12 showed the distribution of lateral stress for the dense backfill 
compacted with the strip compactor. In this Figure, at the lower part of 
the wall, the measured lateral stresses for α = 45o, 60o, 70o, and 80o 
were lower than Jaky’s solution. For α = 60o, 70o and 80o, the 
distributions of lateral stress were similar. The depth of compaction-
influenced zone decreased with increasing interface inclination angle. 
This phenomenon may be explained with the help of Fig. 2. For α = 0o, 
compaction was compacted all over the soil layer. However, for α = 80o, 
compaction was carried out only on the surface of the narrow fill 
sandwiched between the wall and inclined plate. The effective 
compaction depth was significantly influenced by the amount of energy 
input.
