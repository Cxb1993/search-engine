acids (e.g. benzoic acid, isophthalic acid, and trimellitate).16 As a result, the modified imidazoles have 
attracted much attention as latent catalysts to maintain the long pot-life and improve the physical 
properties, as well as the cure reaction at high temperature.   
Latent catalysts in an epoxy resin system can be classified into two groups: thermal17 and cationic 
latent catalyst.18 A lot of pure thermal latent catalysts were developed and reported in the recent 
research because the poor catalyzed reactivity. Most of cationic latent catalysts were published in recent 
year which the reactivity of cationic latent catalysts were enhanced by the nucleophilicity of couterion 
(BF4-, PF6-, AsF6- and SbF6-).19 The acid species (HBF4, HPF6, HAsF6 and HSbF6) would be released 
while the curing polymerization. The acid species would be damaged the electronic products. In this 
work, we first provide a series of the organic acid-base hybrids (5–9) as the latent catalysts. Due to the 
organic carboxylic acid and amino-acid are the weak acid, initially, the ring-opening reaction of epoxy 
resin (DGEBA) can be initiated by the organic Lewis acid moieties. Then, the propagation and 
polymerization was performed by the strong nucleophiles containing the imidazolyl or amino moieties 
at a moderately elevated temperature (100–175 oC) in the second stage. Finally, the polymerization was 
terminated by the protonation of organic Lewis acid-base hybrid catalyst. However, the reactivity and 
nucleophicity of imidazole or amine of the Lewis acid-base hybrids 5–9 would be stabilized and 
modulated by the intramolecular acid moieties (carboxylic acid or amino-acid group) at room 
temperature.  
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
pH Measurement of catalysts (1–9) and the curing mechanism study: 
Two commercial available imidazole catalysts 1 (2E4MZ) and 2 (2E4MZ-CN), a base catalyst 
(histamine, 3) and an acid catalyst (3-phenylpropanoic acid, 4) were purchased order as the comparison 
standards. A series of the organic Lewis acid-base hybrid catalysts (5–9) were purchased or prepared by 
the previously reported method20,21 to investigate the latent and physical properties (see the Scheme 1). 
At first, we used the pH meter to estimate pH values of catalysts (1–9) in water medium. The imidazole 
derivatives catalysts 1–3 appear the basicity and the pH range is between 9.6 and 10.1 in aqueous 
solution. Catalysts 4, including carboxylic acid group, present a weak organic acid in pH 3.2. Catalysts 
5–9 are the intramolecule Lewis acid-base hybrids which included amino-acid, carboxylic acid, and 
imidazolyl functional groups. Most of the apparent pH of catalysts 5–9 provide in the acid range (4.4–
5.8, see Table 1). Except for catalyst 8 appear the light base to neutral (pH = 6.8), due to the Boc-
protecting group (tert-butoxycarbonyl group) decrease the basicity of amino group. We believe the 
2
 
generated pyridine-type nitrogen attacks another epoxy group to produce the 1,3-
disubstitutedimidazolium adduct. Then, the propagation and polymerization was performed by the 
strong nucleophiles containing the imidazolyl or oxygen anion moieties of epoxy at a moderately 
elevated temperature (100–175 oC). Many of mechanisms were proposed for the 1-substituted 
imidazoles (e.g. 2).10b,23-25 However, the first initiation step was proposed to attack by the lone pair 
electrons positioned at the 1-substituted or 3-unsubstituted nitrogen.  
In the structure of the organic Lewis acid-base hybrid catalysts (5–9) own the organic acid 
moieties (carboxylic acid and amino-acid) to initiate the protonation of epoxy ring (see Scheme 2).12,13 
In the second step, the epoxy ring-opening reaction was performed by the nucleophilic species, 
including imidazolyl, amino and oxygen anion of catalysts (5–9). The polymerization was propagated 
by the oxygen anion of epoxy resin.

Measurement of Pot-life: 26  
Sample Preparation Procedure: The catalyst level was set to 2 percent by the weight of 
biglycidylether of bisphenol A epoxy resin (DGEBA, NPEK-114M supplied by Nan Ya Plastics Co. of 
Taiwan, see Scheme 3). The epoxide equivalent weight of DGEBA was 188–199 g/eq and the viscosity 
was 2100–2500 cp. The procedure of preparing samples included sample mixing using a high shear 
blender and sample degassing using a vacuum oven. All of the samples were stored in glass vials at

The cure activation energy (Ea): 
The cure behaviors of DGEBA resin with each catalysts (1–9, 2 wt %) were studied with 
TG/DTA in the dynamic scanning mode. The TG/DTA scans at the different heating rates allowed us to 
determine the cure activation energy (Ea) of the overall process by the Kissinger method:18d,27-28

All scanning TG/DTA studies of the curing behavior were performed with Perkin Elemer 
Instruments Pyris Diamond at heating rate 10 °C/min under N2. High purity indium and zinc were used 
to calibrate the calorimeter. TG/DTA studies of the cure of DGEBA with the each catalyst (1–9) at a 
concentration of 1, 2, 3, and 5 wt % are performed from 30–300 °C at heating rate 10 °C/min under N2. 
Table 3 show the exotherm onset, exotherm peak, and total heat were observed at all four concentrations, 
with the peaks shifting towards lower temperatures due to enhanced reaction rate with increasing 
catalysts (1–9) concentration.25 Total heat output indicates that an exothermic reaction, namely, 
polymerization, has taken place. Typical total heat of curing systems of DGEBA with the imidazoles 
derivatives (1–3, 1–5  wt %) were afforded 8–719 J/g. According to 3-phenylpropanoic acid (4) and 2-
amino-3-phenyl-propinoic acid (H-Phe-OH, 5) are the weak organic acid without the strong 
nucleophilic functional group. As a result, the lower total heats were generated in the DGEBA curing 
systems (10–61 J/g, 1–5 wt %, see Table 3). For compounds 6–9, they own the more strong nucleophilic 
imidazole moiety in the molecular core. Since, they provide the higher exothermic heats (27–677 J/g, 1–
5 wt %). These values of total heat which presented in the Table 3 are consistent with the series of 
imidazole derivative catalysts in the literature reported data.12-15,25,29 However, the total heat output is 
important since too little indicates that no polymerization occurred and too high heat output signifies 
that the reaction will not be scaled up to industrial capacity with a satisfactory safety level.14

aThe heating rate at 10°C/min.   
The curing systems of DGEBA with the commercial latent catalysts 1–2 and the catalysts 3–8 
(preceding the dominant exotherm peak which shifts towards lower temperatures with increasing 
catalysts 1–8 concentration), only one exotherm peak can be observed (e.g. Figure 3–8). For the 
DGEBA/catalyst 9 curing system, the main exotherm peak containing a higher temperature small peak 
(or shoulder) has also observed (see Fig. 9). The shoulder peak is simultaneous increase on the 
increasing catalyst 9 concentration. The formation of shoulder exothermic peak was originated from the 
cleavage of tert-butoxycarbonyl-protecting group (Boc-) by attacking against the nucleophile species 
(amino, imidazolyl and oxygen anion).

aThe glass transition temperature was obtained from second run of DSC at the heating rate 10°C/min.   
bThe conversion was determined by scan of TG/DTA.

Figure 11 and Table 4 show the conversion of the DGEBA cured by each catalyst (1–9) as a 
function of the curing temperature obtained from dynamic TG/DTA. In addition to 4, the conversion of 
all catalysts is rapidly activated at a specific temperature (see Fig.11). In the cases o f DGEBA/the 
imidazole derivatives catalysts (1 and 3), the conversion rapidly increased above 140–165°C and 
decreased gradually above 180–185°C, whereas the conversion of DGEBA/1-cyanoethyl-2-ethyl-4-
methyl-imidazole (2) increased drastically above 165°C because of the N1-substituted hindred group to 
inhibit the reactivity of catalyst. 3-Phenylpropanoic acid (4) is a weak acid and own a catalyst reactivity, 
the conversion is slowly activated from 185°C to 290°C. Since, compound 4 is not an efficient catalyst 
in this epoxy system. For catalyst 6 and 7, the conversion rapidly increased above 164 or 178°C and 
decreased gradually above 191 or 211°C, respectly.  In the DGEBA/amino-acid catalysts (5 and 8) case, 
the reactivity of imidazole was decreased by the acidic amino-acid group. As a result, the conversion 
14
 
to undergo thermal cure reaction without the generation of the harmful specious. But, most of cationic 
latent catalysts would be released the acidic species by-product (HBF4, HPF6, HAsF6 and HSbF6) and 
damaged the electronic products while the curing polymerization due to the reactivity of is enhanced by 
the nucleophilicity of couterion (e.g. BF4¯, PF6¯, AsF6¯ and SbF6¯). The Tg values of the organic Lewis 
acid-base hybrid catalysts (5–9, > 150°C) are better or similar the commercial available catalysts 1 and 
2. Since, the designed organic Lewis acid-base hybrid catalysts 5–9 are very stable at room temperature 
and prolong the pot-life of DGEBA resin could provide a degree of low storage stability and good 
handling because of the low reactivity at ambient temperature.
