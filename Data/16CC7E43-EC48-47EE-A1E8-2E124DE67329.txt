2be adjusted to a better one in the placing process.
In some formulation methods the cutting-stock problem is treated as a standard
optimisation problem, and uses the object positions and orientations as design
variables. The overlaps with the overlap areas are considered directly. Ismail and Hon
(1995) also used binary matrices to represent the objects, but the object profiles may
become deformed if the binary matrices, instead of the real objects, are rotated. Also,
the calculation effort increases when rotating the real objects. This is because the
objects have to be transferred to binary matrices after every rotation, and using the
binary matrices to determine the overlap area also requires increased computation
effort. Petridis and Kazarlis (1994) used the real profiles instead of binary matrices
and calculated the overlap of real objects when considering the overlaps. The object
profiles will not be deformed by this method, but the rotation of objects is not
considered.
Kershner (1968) showed that no convex polygon with more than six sides can be
nested without gaps, and there are only eight kinds of pentagons and three kinds of
hexagons that can be nested without gaps. The cutting-stock problem may be changed
to approximate an object as a special pattern because the nesting pattern is decided
when the special pattern is chosen. Various methods based on polygon approximation
have been proposed (Koroupi and Loftus, 1991; Yu and Tseng, 2005).
A review of the literature shows that the Genetic Algorithm, the artificial neural
network, and other heuristic algorithms are commonly-used methods for solving the
cutting-stock problem. However, there are also many other algorithms, such as SLP
(Arora, 2004) (Sequential Linear Programming), traditional SQP (Arora, 2004)
(Sequential Quadratic Programming), and CSD (Arora, 2004) (Constrained Steepest
Descent), that can be used to solve this type of optimisation problem. These
algorithms use the gradient or Hessian calculation of the cost function as the search
direction. An algorithm called“active-set SQP method”(Lim and Arora, 1986) in this
study, based on the traditional SQP method, reduces the calculation effort by reducing
the considered constraints.
This study presents a formulation, and solves it by using active-set SQP method
for generating the cluster. The formulation considers the orientations of objects
directly, and improves the sensitivity between the cost function and design variables.
Thus, the problem can be solved by the traditional SQP method that is more efficient
than the Genetic Algorithm. This study also presents an overlap index that considers
the overlap amount instead of the overlap area. Thus, the calculation effort may be
reduced and is well-suited for the active-set SQP method.
2. Method
A solving method for the cutting-stock problem can be divided into two parts: the
overlap consideration method, and the placing strategy, which depends on the overlap
consideration method. Therefore, the overlap consideration method will be introduced
before introducing the placing strategy in this section.
The objects of the cutting-stock problem cannot overlap one other. In traditional
methods, the overlap area is calculated and the object positions are adjusted to reduce
the overlap area until the total overlap area equals to zero when considering overlap
directly. However, calculating the real overlap area is computation-intensive, so
another index should preferably be used instead of the real overlap area. This study
uses the maximum “depth”of two objects as the overlap index when considering the
overlap.
When considering overlap between two objects, the “depth”means the distance
from the vertex on one object to a point on the edge of the other object, and the
4sensitive to the design variables than the number of objects or the necessary sheet
stock area. Therefore, it is more suitable for the traditional SQP method. The
constraints are that the maximum depths of any two objects cannot be larger than zero,
i.e., one object can only be far away or just contact the adjacent object.
As shown in Equation (3), there are many constraints when the number of objects
is large, and reducing the number of constraints is important in order to decrease the
calculation effort. Because of the nature of this problem, the constraints may not be
reduced in physical ways, but they can be reduced using mathematical methods. If the
solution satisfies the constraint, it will not be necessary to consider whether or not the
constraint still exists. Therefore, the active-set SQP method is used to reduce the
considered constraints in this study.
A constraint will never be inactive when using the overlap area as the constraint
value because the overlap area is never less than zero. Thus, the number of constraints
cannot be reduced. However, when using the maximum depth to consider overlap, the
maximum depth will be negative if there is a gap between two objects, and therefore
the constraint becomes inactive. These constraints will be ignored and the
computation effort will be decreased.
After formulating the problem as a constrained optimisation problem, it can be
solved by using the active-set SQP method. The SQP method is a numerical method
for solving optimisation problem. The process of a numerical method is an iterative
process of finding“search direction”and“step size”.
To solve the optimization problem by SQP method, the KKT conditions of the
Lagrange function is used. The Lagrange function is defined as follows:
( , ) ( ) TL d f d g   (4)
where μis the vector form of Lagrange multipliers, and d is a collection of design
variables, i.e. xi, yi,θi. The numerical solving process of the KKT conditions is an
iterative process of calculating the new solution d(k+1)
( 1) ( ) ( )k k kd d d   (5)
where k is the iteration number, and Δd(k) is the change of design variables. It is also
the search direction of the SQP method. The SQP method defines a QP subproblem to
calculate the search direction. The flowchart of SQP method is shown in Fig. 3, and
the process is described as follows.
1. Select an initial solution, and the initial solution is d(0)=0 in this study. Set other
parameters that will be described later.
2. Define the QP subproblem with the active-set strategy. The QP subproblem is
defined as follows:
minimize 0.5T Tf d d H d     (6)
subject to TA d b  (7)
where H is the approximate Hessian matrix of Lagrange function,
'i
j i

' ( )i ib g d . (9)
When defining the QP subproblem, only the active and violated constraints need
to be considered. The 'g is the vector form of active and violated constraints.
This is the so-called active-set strategy.
3. After the QP subproblem is defined, the problem will be normalised before
solving (Arora, 1984). For normalising the QP subproblem, the H is decomposed
as
6where ( ) ( ) ( )kd f d R F d   (30)

8. Update the approximate Hessian matrix. The approximate Hessian matrix is
updated by BFGS strategy that is described as follows:
Define three variables first.
( ) ( ) ( )k k k

9. Update the solution as
( 1) ( ) ( )k k k

and continue to define the QP subproblem.
All equations are shown above, and the derivation can be found in Arora (2004)
and Liao(1990). There are some programs used the active-set SQP method to solve
the constrained optimisation problem, such as MOST (Tseng) and IDESIGN (Arora).
After having introduced the methods a case study is given in the next section and the
results are discussed.
3. Case Study
The example used in this section was first introduced by Cheng and Rao (1997,
1999, 2000). The profiles of objects that will be nested are shown and numbered as in
Fig. 6. Objects 2 and 3 have the same profile; objects 7 and 8 also have the same
profile. The coordinate values are shown with local coordinate systems in Table 1.
The COGs are set as the origins of the local coordinate systems, and will be used to
represent the positions of objects.
In the first step, the design variables are the coordinate values (xi, yi) and object
orientations ( i). There are 24 design variables in this case because there are eight
objects and every object needs three design variables to represent its position and
orientation. The cost function is to minimise the summation distances between objects
(as shown in Equation (1)), and the 28 constraints are that no two objects may overlap
(as shown in Equation (3)). This means all objects have to be as close as possible
without overlap. Even if there are many constraints in this case, the inactive
constraints will be ignored in the active-set SQP solving process when using the
maximum depth to consider the overlaps.
Deciding the initial solution is another problem in the optimisation process, and
different initial solutions will lead to different local optimum solutions. The initial
8and 200×200 sheet stock, the number of objects is improved by 5.28% and 4.91%
respectively. However, after improving the nesting pattern by the Genetic Algorithm,
there are up to 62 clusters in the literature method, while there are 66 clusters in this
study after the third step. Thus, the number of objects is improved by 6.45%. The
proposed method improves the number of objects in these cases by between three and
six percent. Therefore, the proposed method has better results for rotatable objects and
requires less calculation effort.
For testing the efficiency of the method, this study uses other two cases called
Dagli and Swim (http://paginas.fe.up.pt/~esicup/tiki-index.php). The clusters are
shown in Fig. 13, and the information of the object can be found in the ESICUP
website. The stock sizes are selected randomly, and the results are shown in Table 5
and 6, and. The results by using this method are better than the CNA with GA. Thus,
the approach proposed in this study is a good method not only for one special case.
4. Conclusions
The cutting-stock problem is considered in many manufacturing industries, and
the method for solving it can be divided into two parts: the overlap consideration
method, and the placing strategy. The objects will not be rotatable if using a sliding
technique to avoid overlap, while the calculation effort will be large if using real
overlap area as the overlap index. Using binary matrices to represent objects can
reduce the calculation effort, but the objects may be deformed after rotation. The
placing strategies using different placing sequence in finding the best placement for
the multi-polygon cutting-stock problem do not use gradient information or Hessian
information. Therefore, this study proposes:
1. Using the maximum depth as the overlap index instead of real overlap area to
reduce the calculation effort.
2. By using the maximum depth as the overlap index, the objects are not coded in
binary matrices and they will not deform in different orientations.
3. The cutting-stock problem is formulated as a constrained optimisation problem,
and can be solved by the active-set SQP method in the first step of the placing
strategy. The active-set SQP method is a Hessian-based method and will improve
the efficiency of searching for the optimum placing pattern.
4. The summation of distances between objects is used as the cost function, and is
more sensitive than using the necessary sheet stock area or the number of objects
placed in the sheet stock. It is more suitable for the SQP method.
5. The overlaps are the constraints of the cutting-stock problem, and the constraint
consideration will be reduced by using the active-set SQP method with the
maximum depth as the overlap index. This is because the constraints will be
ignored if the overlap indices are less than zero, i.e., the maximum depths are less
than zero and the constraints become inactive.
6. The nesting pattern is improved easily in the third step of the placing strategy by
aligning the three nesting vector with the X- and Y-axis, respectively, and
choosing the best one as the final nesting pattern.
