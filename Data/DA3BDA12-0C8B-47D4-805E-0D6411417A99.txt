Abstract
The fatigue lives of friction stir spot
welds in aluminum 6061-T6 lap-shear
specimens under cyclic loading conditions
are investigated in this paper. The paths of
fatigue cracks near friction stir spot welds in
lap-shear specimens are first examined.
The experimental observations suggest that
under cyclic loading conditions, the fatigue
crack is initiated near the possible original
notch tip in the stir zone and propagates
along the circumference of the nugget, then
through the sheet thickness, finally grows in
the width direction to cause final fracture.
A fatigue crack growth model based on the
Paris law for crack propagation and the local
stress intensity factors for kinked cracks is
then adopted to predict the fatigue lives of
friction stir spot welds. The global and
local stress intensity factors are used to
estimate the local stress intensity factors of
kinked cracks with experimentally
determined kink angles. The results
indicate that the fatigue life predictions based
on the Paris law and the local stress intensity
factors as functions of the kink length agree
well with the experimental results.

1. Introduction
A rapid development of applications of
lightweight materials in the automotive
industry is reflected in the increasing use of
aluminum and magnesium alloys. Many
components produced from these alloys, by
stamping, casting, extrusion and forging,
have to be joined as a part of manufacturing
processes. Resistance spot welding (RSW)
is the most commonly used joining technique
for parts made of steel sheets. The main
advantages of the resistance spot welding
process are its relatively low capital cost,
ease of maintenance, and high tolerance to
poor part fit up compared with other fusion
welding technologies [1]. However,
resistance spot welding of aluminum sheets
by contrast has several technological
challenges. First, the electrode tip life is
shorter than that for welding steel sheets.
Resistance spot welding of aluminum sheets
4A load cell (CLP-5B, Tokyo Sokki Kenkyujo
Co., Ltd.) was placed under the backing tool
to measure the downward force during
friction stir spot welding. We used a NI
SCXI-1121 isolated input module with a
sampling rate up to 51033.3  samples/sec
to acquire signals from the load cell and a NI
SCXI-1600 module with a sampling rate of
200,000 samples/second and 16-bit
resolution to provide data acquisition and
control capabilities.
For the conventional friction stir spot
welding process, the important processing
parameters are the tool geometry, the
rotational speed, the holding time and the
downward force. As schematically shown
in Fig. 4, during the friction stir spot welding
process in this investigation, the rotational
speed is kept constant and the downward
force is controlled by the riveting machine
control unit. Initially, the downward force
increases almost linearly for a period of time.
Then the downward force is kept nearly
constant for a period of time and finally
decreases almost linearly to zero. As shown
in the figure, it represents the time that the
tool contacts to the top surface of the upper
sheet and ft represents the time that tool
extracts from the top surface of the upper
sheet. The time between it and ft
represents the total holding time. The
rotational speed, constant downward force,
holding time if tt  , and force holding time
for the friction stir spot welding of the
specimens are 3450 rpm, 1548 N, 40 sec, and
37 sec, respectively.
Fig. 5(a) is a photo of a tool used in this
investigation. The tool has a cylindrical
shoulder and a cone-shaped probe. Fig. 5(b)
shows a schematic of an extracted tool and
two welded sheets after welding. The
diameters of the tool shoulder and the probe
pin used in this investigation are 12 mm and
5 mm, respectively. The depth of the probe
pin is 1.5 mm. The angle of the chamber
with the probe end surface is 10 . H is
the plunge depth of the tool. The actual
bonding diameter for the weld is denoted as
cD . The plunge depth, H , and the
diameter of the weld, cD , will depend upon
the processing parameters.
The lap-shear specimens were then
tested by using a fatigue testing machine
(EHF-F1, Shimadzu Co., Japan) with a load
ratio R of 0.2. The test frequency was 10
Hz. Tests were terminated when the two
sheets of the specimen were separated, or
nearly separated. In order to understand the
fatigue crack growth behavior, micrographs
of the cross-sections of the specimens at
various stages of the fatigue life were
obtained.
3. Fatigue crack growth model
In order to develop an engineering
fatigue model, we idealize the
three-dimensional friction stir spot weld
problem to a two-dimensional crack problem.
The model developed below follows the
basic procedure described by Lin et al. [6].
Fig. 6(a) shows a schematic of the symmetry
cross section of a lap-shear specimen made
by the tool with the sheet thickness t under an
applied load (shown as the bold arrows).
Fig. 6(b) shows a schematic of the cross
section near the friction stir spot weld made.
In these figures, the shadow represents the
stir zone, the dashed line represents the
unwelded interfacial surface and the thin
solid line represents the fatigue crack. As
shown in Fig. 6(b), a kinked fatigue crack,
marked as crack 1, is initiated from the
original crack tip in the upper sheet with a
kink angle  . Another fatigue crack,
marked as crack 2, is initiated from the
original crack tip in the lower sheet. Based
on the experimental observations described
in the next section, the spot friction welds
made by the tool appear to be dominated by
the kinked fatigue crack 1 in the upper sheet.
Note that the kink angle  of fatigue crack
1 is estimated to be 75 for the friction stir
spot weld.
Fig. 7 shows a schematic of a main crack
and a kinked crack with the kink length a
and the kink angle  . Here, IK and
IIK represent the global stress intensity
factors for the main crack, and Ik and IIk
represent the local stress intensity factors for
6finite element computations of Wang et al.
[12] are denoted as  Pan&WangIk and
  Pan&WangIIk , respectively, in Fig. 9. Note
that when the kink angle  is close to 90 ,
the maximum local stress intensity factors
appear not to be affected by the kink angle
 significantly [15] and, consequently, the
fatigue life predictions are not affected by the
choice of  significantly [18]. The local
Ik and IIk solutions as functions of the
kink length a can be obtained from the
linear interpolation between the normalized
local Ik and IIk solutions shown in Fig. 9.
Note that the local Ik and IIk solutions for
0.17.0  ta are not available. We
assume the variations of the local Ik and
IIk solutions for 0.17.0  ta are the
same as those for 7.05.0  ta .
Since the fatigue crack growth is under local
combined mode I and mode II loading
conditions, an equivalent stress intensity
factor, eqk , can be defined as [19]
22 )()()( akakak IIIeq  (7)
where  is an empirical constant to account
for the sensitivity of materials to mode II
loading conditions. For lack of any further
information, we take  as 1 in this paper.
Now we adopt the Paris law to describe the
fatigue crack propagation
m
eq akCdN

))(( (8)
where N is the life or number of cycles, C
and m are material constants, and eqk is
the range of the equivalent stress intensity
factor. Since the global and local stress
intensity factors discussed here are functions
of the kink length a , the fatigue life of spot
welds can be obtained by integrating Eq. (8)
as

where 0, 0.05, 0.2, …, 0.7, and 1.0 represent

ta as shown in Fig. 9. Note that we
assume the total crack growth distance is
equal to sint due to the kink angle 
as shown in Fig. 6(b). Therefore, the life is
increased by a factor of sin1 as indicated
in Eq. (9).
We also consider a simplified model with the
local stress intensity factors 0Ik and
 0IIk for the kink length a approaching to 0
[20]. Now eqk in Eq. (7) and the Paris law
in Eq. (8) can now be written as

Here we assume the total crack growth

consider the simplified model since the
closed form solution exists for this case and
we would like to understand the applicability
of the simplified model.
4. Results and discussions
4.1 Friction stir spot welds of aluminum
6061-T6 sheets
Fig. 10(a) shows a lap-shear friction stir
spot weld specimen. Fig. 10(b) shows a
close-up top view of the friction stir spot
weld on the upper sheet. As shown in the
top view, the top surface of the weld looks
like a button with a central hole. The
squeezed-out material is accumulated along
the outer circumference of the shoulder
indentation. Fig. 10(c) shows a close-up
bottom view of the friction stir spot weld on
the lower sheet. In the bottom view, the
contact mark due to the backing tool can be
seen.
In order to understand the fatigue failure
mechanisms of friction stir spot welds under
8Fig. 13 shows the experimental results for
friction stir spot welds and the fatigue life
predictions based on the fatigue models in
Eqs. (9) and (12). The predictions are
obtained from the nugget diameter
mm5.8cD and the sheet thickness
mm1t . The stress intensity factors
discussed in the previous section are adopted.
Here, the kink angle  is taken to be 75
for the frictional stir spot welds based on the
micrographs shown in Fig. 14. The material
constants
m
C
)m(MPa
mm/cycle
1039.1 6 and
01.2m for aluminum 6061-T6 [24] are
used to estimate the fatigue lives for the spot
welds. No effort is attempted to select the
material constants C and m in the Paris law
to fit the experimental results. As shown in
Fig. 13, the predicted fatigue lives
determined from the global K solutions in
Eqs. (1) and (2) and the local k(a) solutions
determined from the values shown in Fig. 9
appear to agree well with the experimental
results. The predicted fatigue lives based on
the global K solutions and the local 0)(k
solutions in Eq. (12) appear to be slightly
higher than the experimental results.
4.3 Discussions
It is shown that the predicted fatigue lives of
friction stir spot welds based on the global K
solutions and the local 0)(k solutions in Eq.
(12) are higher than those based on the global
K solutions and the local k(a) solutions in Eq.
(9). As shown in Fig. 9, when the kink
length a increases, the value of the local
)(akI solutions becomes larger than that of
the local 0)( Ik solutions but the value of the
local )(akII solutions becomes less than
that of the local 0)( IIk solutions. On the
other hand, the local )(akI solutions are
relatively larger than the local )(akII
solutions as reported in Wang et al. [12].
Consequently, the local )(akeq solutions in
Eq. (7) become larger than the local 0)( eqk
solutions in Eq. (10) for all values of a .
Therefore, the predicted fatigue lives based
on the global K solutions and the local k
solutions in Eq. (9) are lower than those
based on the global K solutions and the local
0)(k solutions in Eq. (12).
5. Conclusions
The fatigue lives and crack paths of friction
stir spot welds in lap-shear specimens of
aluminum 6061-T6 lap-shear specimens were
investigated based on experimental
observations. For friction stir spot welds
made in this investigation, fatigue cracks
grow along the circumference of the weld
nugget, then propagate through the sheet
thickness, grow in the width direction and
finally cause the fracture of the specimen.
A fatigue crack growth model based on the
Paris law for crack propagation and the
global and local stress intensity factors for
kinked cracks is adopted to predict fatigue
lives of the spot welds. The fatigue lives of
the friction stir spot welds in lap-shear
specimens predicted by the model agree with
the experimental results.

六月五日深夜一早抵達 Austin,當晚至旅社後，準備明日報告內容。
六月六日一早至開會會場.我報告的 session 於下午開始，M. Rahman 針對 Photostrictive
optical actuator，提出了一個 FEM 的 model，與會者對其研究內容提出許多建議，從答問
間獲益良多，往後應可利用光做為為致動器的動力源。之後就輪到我報告了，針對我的報告，
聽眾問了建模的考慮因素。之後聆聽 Miss Jonsdottir 有關生醫工程的報告。此 session 的
最後一場報告是 S. Seelecke 關於形狀記憶合金之剪力樑之熱機分析，我獲得許多對熱機耦
合分析的研究方向與應用於密前實驗室設計中的致動器的的研究改進方式。因需趕搭晚上班
機，就到機場去了。
二、與會心得
我的 session 中報告者的英文表達都很有水準，尤其 Miss Jonsdottir 的簡報內容，圖文並
茂，有許多彩色圖片，很吸引人。與會者的分析及建模的數學理論都很深入，自己回台三年
來，文章的深度退步許多，非常需要加強，而提問者對學理及應用皆有深入見解，讓自己深
覺所學不足。此次會議對主辦單位的工作人員的敬業及專業態度印象很好。
三、考察參觀活動(無是項活動者省略)
無
四、建議
UT Austin 工學院此次辦研討會，雖然場地不大，但安排得宜，因為動線的安排很順暢，課
會場的各電腦、麥克風都很妥當，並且會議的用餐地點及指南都作得很詳細，讓與會者不致
有困擾。而負責接待的工作人員都很專業，不會讓人不知如何繳費，或所得答案莫衷一是，
共作人員的能力及態度是一個成功研討會很重要的關鍵。對我個人的建議是，不要盲目追求
研究時尚，這樣很難做出有水準的東西，對於應該延伸先前的研究基礎，做出有份量的成果。
