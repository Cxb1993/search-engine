Abstract
電腦模擬原子及分子系統可提供對物理系統的瞭解，以分子模擬的方式，系
統的楊氏模數、黏滯性及擴散係數等均可加以評估。本計畫利用分子動力學模
擬(MD)及量子分子動力模擬(QMD)，對氫原子、氫分子及奈米碳結構物，進行計
算分析。分子動力學(Molecular dynsmics MD)僅試用於原子間交互作用力是由外
層電子主導，在高壓下或可能發生化學反應的情況下，QMD可以藉由密度泛函理
論(Density functional theory DFT)，直接對量子力學之薛丁格爾方程式求解，計算
原子間的交互作用力，在藉由Born-Oppenheimer approximation假設，以牛頓第二定
律計算原子核的移動。在本計畫中，使用 MD 和 QMD 的方法，對氫儲存於奈米
載具中，進行計算評估。對氫分子在碳富勒烯中，QMD顯示最高氫之重量百分比
為1.4%，即五個氫分子在碳60內部。越大的富勒烯或碳管，可儲存越多的氫分子。
至於氫之加入及釋放機制，模擬結果顯示改變溫度及壓力(如10GPa)即可。本研究
亦顯示石墨層間可儲存氫分子。除此之外，本研究亦對氫分子在碳管內的擴散行為
進行研究，在開口奈米載具中，隨機振動造成的擴散現象，可使氫分子儲存於碳管
中，一但儲存後，將碳管至於低溫，降低熱騷動，達到儲存的目的。在對碳管的熱
振盪分析時，發現氫分子可以物理吸附的方式儲存在碳管外壁，因此碳管叢集可為
一高儲氫的載具。未來仍須對有機金屬載具(Metal-organic frameworks MOFs)進行研
究，探討更高含氫量之可能性。

Computer simulations of atomic and molecular systems are of particle use to under-
stand the physical mechanisms and stability of the systems. In particular, physical prop-
erties, such as elastic constants, viscosity, and diffusional coefficients, can be calculated
before experiment. In this project, we study the hydrogen storage and related problems in
carbon nanotubes, carbon fullerenes and graphite. Both conventional molecular dynam-
ics (MD) and quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) are adopted in analyzing the physical
problems. Details of the two simulation methods are provided in this report. The hydrogen-
carbon systems since the interaction between hydrogen and carbon atoms in the extremely
confined geometry, i.e. high pressure, through packing cannot be correctly modeled by
empirical interatomic potentials in MD. However, it is feasible to use MD is the interaction
among atoms only involve their outer shell electrons. In QMD, the interatomic forces are
calculated by solving the Schro¨dinger’s equation with the density functional theory (DFT)
formulation, and the positions of the atomic nucleus are calculated with the Newton’s sec-
ond law in accordance with the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. In this study, it is found
that carbon fullerenes and capped nanotubes are able to store hydrogen molecules inside.
The amounts of hydrogen inside the two nanocages depend on the size of the cages. For
example, the C60 fullerene may store up to 5 hydrogen molecules, representing 1.4 weight
percent when compared to the cage. More hydrogen may deteriorate the cages due to pos-
sible formation chemical bonds between carbon and hydrogen. For the refilling and release
mechanisms, by controlling the external pressure and elevated temperature of the simula-
tion box, the hydrogen may be released from or squeezed into the nanocages, the fullerene
can be stable under 10 GPa environment. There may be an optimal time, pressure and tem-
perature for refilling and release of hydrogen from the nanocages. In addition, we have also

1 Introduction
The oil consumption increases with time, shown shown in Figure 1(a). Through correlation,
Figure 1(b) seems the emission of carbon dioxide follows the trend of oil consumption. Hence,
in order to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide, alternative energy is a must. Several possible
technologies for future energy sources are discussed in [4]. Figure 2 (a) shows the option how
one can utilize hydrogen in various forms. The comparison of the various forms is shown in
Figure 2(b). To make hydrogen energy source competitive in the market, the weight percent of
hydrogen to the host materials must be greater than 8%.
Hydrogen economy provides low carbon dioxide pollution to the environment, but must be
compete with other alternative energy sources in the free market [2]. For hydrogen storage for
vehicles [5], efficient methods are required to carry hydrogen in moving vehicles. In order to
obtain high volume fraction hydrogen storage, it has been proposed to adopt nano-scale cages,
such as carbon fullerenes, carbon nanotubes or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). In this work,
quantum molecular dynamics simulations (QMD) are preformed to study the hydrogen-carbon
systems since the interaction between hydrogen and carbon atoms in the extremely confined
geometry through packing cannot be correctly modeled by empirical interatomic potentials. In
QMD, the interatomic forces are calculated by solving the Schrodinger’s equation with the den-
sity functional theory (DFT) formulation, and the positions of the atomic nucleus are calculated
with the Newton’s second law in accordance with the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The
carbon nanocages investigated in this work is the C60 fullerene. The structural stability of the
nanocages is tested by long-time MD simulations under high pressure, 10 GPa. The hydrogen-
carbon systems are tested with various hydrogen atoms. Simulation results show hydrogen can
exist as H2 molecules in the nanocages. Furthermore, by controlling the external pressure of
the simulation box, the hydrogen may be released from or squeezed into the nanocages, which
serves as the fundamental mechanism to use and fuel hydrogen with the nanocage device. The
stability of hydrogen-carbon system under high pressure requires further investigation.
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are an important tool to study nanoscale systems that
are experimentally inaccessible. However, conventional molecular dynamics relies on empirical
interatomic potentials to describe the interaction among atoms. The potentials are, in general,
fitted with experimental data to determine the necessary parameters in the potential functions.
Hence, two drawbacks in the conventional MD. One is the choice of the potential functional
and the other the determined parameters are only valid for bulk materials since they are fitted
with experimental data from bulk materials. Use of quantum molecular dynamics simulation
bypasses the drawbacks since the interatomic force is calculated from the electron interaction,
but severely increases computation cost.
The hydrogen storage problem is critical for the development of hydrogen economy. In addition
to using metal hydrides, nano-cages provide an ideal solution to be a hydrogen carrier. There
are several possible nanocages, as follows.
1. Fullerene: closed nanocage

2 Molecular dynamics simulation
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation solves the Newton’s second law to obtain positions and
velocities of atoms in the time evolution. Accelerations of the atoms are governed by a pre-
chosen interatomic potential. The difference between MD and quantum molecular dynamics
(QMD) lies at how to calculate interatomic forces. QMD obtains the forces by solving the
Schrodinger equation among electrons. We first introduce the MD simulation by a successful
example in Section 2.1.
2.1 Introduction to MD simulation
The Lennard-Jones liquid is described by the following interatomic potential between atom i
and j, where rij = |ri − rj|.
U(rij) = 4ε
[(
σ
rij
)12
−
(
σ
rij
)6]
. (1)
The coefficients  and σ are species dependent. By measuring the mean-squared displacement
of atom i, defined as
∆(t) =
〈
1
N
N∑
i=1
|ri(t)− ri(0)|2
〉
, (2)
one can determine the self-diffusion constant Ds.
Ds = lim
t→∞
∆(t)
6t
. (3)
The angular brackets represent the ensemble average over initial conditions weighted with
Boltzmann distribution. A result is shown in Figure 3. Mean-squared displacements of individ-
ual particles in a simple model of a glass-forming liquid obeying the Lennard-Jones interatomic
potential. T is normalized to the glass transition temperature, and τ0 is on the order of
√
ma2
kBT
with m being the molecular mass and a the distance between molecules. When temperature de-
creases (from left to right, i.e. reduction of T), the particle displacements become increasingly
slow with several distinct time regimes corresponding, in this order, to ballistic, localized, and
diffusive regimes, as shown in Figure 3 (a) [3]. In Figure 3 (b), the spatial distribution map
of single-particle displacements is shown for a binary mixture of Lennard-Jones mixture in two
dimensions. Arrows show the displacement of each particle in a trajectory of length comparable
to the structural relaxation time. The map reveals the existence of particles with different mo-
bilities during relaxation, but also the existence of spatial correlations between these dynamic
fluctuations.
The simulations of Lennard-Jones particles have a strong connection to amorphous materials,
such as polymers, glasses or metallic glasses.

The summation of Eqs (9) and (11) results in the following.
ri(t+ δt) = 2ri(t)− ri(t− δt) + 1
mi
(δt)2fi(t) +O((δt)
4) (12)
Once the position vectors are determined, the corresponding velocity vectors can be obtained
by
vi(t) =
1
2(δt)
[ri(t+ δt)− ri(t− δt)] +O((δt)3). (13)
Further manipulations show the position vectors in the next time step can be calculated as fol-
lows.
ri(t+ δt) = ri(t) + δtvi +
1
2mi
(δt)2fi(t) (14)
And, the velocity vectors are determined as
vi(t+ δt) = vi(t) +
δt
2mi
[fi(t) + fi(t+ δt)] (15)
The above equations are fundamental to simulate the movement of atoms in space and time.
However, to reach high accuracy, one has to use high order finite difference, as stated in the
next section.
2.3 Numerical ODE solution
In this section, the basic relationship for the finite difference method that is used in MD simula-
tion, for solving time evolution, is provided. Modern high order finite difference methods have
their roots in the Adams open and close formula and the predictor-corrector methods, stated as
below.
2.3.1 Adams open formula
Assume the function y = y(t) is time dependent.
dy
dt
= f(t, y). (16)
y(0) = y0. (17)
The forward Taylor expansion is
yk+1 = yk + (∆t)y
′
k +
(∆t)2
2!
y′′k +
(∆t)2
3!
y′′′k + · · · . (18)
The Taylor expansion can be rewritten as follows.
yk+1 = yk + (∆t)

fk +
(∆t)

f ′k +
(∆t)2

f ′′k + · · ·

for k = 4, 5, ,6 ,... The y value for k=0,1,2,3 are calculated from Runge-Kutta method, i.e.
yk+1 = yk +
h

(E1 + 2E2 + 2E3 + E4). (32)
E1 = f(t, y). (33)

E4 = f(t+ h, y +

The iteration number is `. In order to reduce the iteration number, a modifier is used.
y˜

k+1 = y

k+1 −
251
270
(yk − y(0)k ) (38)
This is equation is derived from the truncation error. y(0) is the unmodified value. The purpose
of the modifier is to reduce the iteration numbers. The computation scheme is (1) use Runge-
Kutta to solve the first three y’s. (2) Find y(0)k+1. (3) Calculate the modifier y˜
(0)k+1 . (4) Perform
iteration to calculate y`+1k+1. Usually the number of iteration is less than 3.
2.5 Microscopic ensembles
Ensembles are important for quantifying physical quantities from the motion of atoms. They
are a fundamental concept in statistical physics. Essentially, all ensembles are identical to
the physical reality when thermodynamics limits are reached. However, since, in computer
simulation, it is impossible to reach true thermodynamics limits, the choice of ensembles may
affect solutions by changing the probability distribution of certain physical quantities, such as
velocities. Common ensembles are listed as below.
1. Microcanonical ensemble, NVE: constant number of atoms, constant volume, constant
energy.
7
The total hamiltonian of the NVT system is H ′, and it is related to the original hamiltonian H ,
i.e. NVE system, by the following equation.
H ′ = H +
1
2
Qς2 + 3NkBT
∫
ς(t′)dt′ (46)
Therefore, for a chosen ensemble, there is a corresponding hamiltonian. Different constraints
on the ensemble impose different statistical distribution of physical quantities. Details can be
found in [15, 17].
2.6 Linear Response Theory
The linear response theory provides important means to calculate physical quantities, such as
elastic constants or diffusion coefficients, from the time history of atoms.
2.6.1 Elastic constants
The Taylor expansion of the Helmholtz free energy F per unit of undeformed volume V0 in
powers of the Lagrangian strain εαβ is as follows.
F
V
=
1
V0
[
F (0) +
∂F
∂εαβ
εαβ +
1
2
∂2F
∂εαβ∂εγδ
εαβεγδ
]
(47)
One defines the following quantities.
C
(1)
αβ =
1
V0
∂F
∂εαβ
εαβ. (48)
C
(2)
αβγδ =

V0
∂2F
∂εαβ∂εγδ
εαβεγδ (49)
The deformation gradient tensor states the following relationship of a position vector in the
unprimed and primed coordinate system.
r′α = (δαβ + Fαβ)rβ. (50)
Fαβ =
∂uα
∂xβ
. (51)
In the matrix notation, the distance square between the i and j atom is as follows.
r′2ij = [hrij]
T [hrij] . (52)
h = (I+ F). (53)
The index notation of the above equation is
r′2ij = rijα(δαβ + 2εαβ)rijβ . (54)
εαβ =
1
2
(Fαβ + Fβα). (55)
9
The first derivative of the kinetic term w.r.t. εαβ is as follows.
∂K
∂εαβ
=
∑ 1

Hence,

∂εαβ
= −
(
h−1 ·
(∑ 1
mi
pp
)
· h−T
)
αβ
. (69)
Combining Eq. (67) and Eq. (69) , the first order elastic constants are
C
(1)
αβ =
1
V0
∂F
∂εαβ
= − 1

One can further use the above equation to define stress as follows. Recall h = I+ F.
C

αβ =

V0
[
(I+ F)−1 σ (I+ F)−T

∑

]
. (72)
Here V is the current volume of the system. A direct way to calculate the first order and second
order elastic constants are as follows by determining the initial linear dependent of C(1)αβ on εγδ.
C
(1)
αβ =
√
I+ 2ε[h−1σh−T ]αβ. (73)
∂σαβ
∂εγδ
= (σαδδβγ + σβδδαγ − σαβδγδ) + C(2)αβγδ. (74)
An alternative way of calculating the second order elastic constants is the following. This
method suffers serious statistical errors.

2.6.2 Viscosity
The shear viscosity η is
η =

V kBT
∫ ∞

V is the volume of the simulation cell. The steady-state stress from a steady shear is

3 Quantum Molecular Dynamics Simulation
Mechanical properties of materials at the nano-scales are ultimately determined by their elec-
tronic structures and interactions, which are governed by the time-independent Schro¨dinger
equation, as shown in Eqs. (1) and (2). The electron wave function Ψ = Ψ(x1, x2, x3) is
governed by the eigenvalue problem with the total energy E as the eigenvalue of the state.
HΨ = EΨ (124)
The differential operator H is expressed as follows.

The first term is the kinetic operator, involving the Laplacian differential operator, for the num-
ber of electrons N. The second term describes the electron-nucleus interactions, the third term
for the electron-electron interactions and the last term the nucleus-nucleus interactions. It is
noted that the Hamiltonian differential operator H is position-dependent. Position vectors r and
R delineate the location of electron and nucleus, respectively. The symbol Z indicates the nu-
cleus charge, and subscripts i and k label the electrons and nuclei, respectively. The number
of nucleus is assumed to be M. The Born-Oppenheimer approximation is embedded in the Eq.
(1) to simply the many-body Hamiltonian by using the large mismatch between electron and
nucleus mass.
Solving the Schrodinger’s equation many-electron systems is not practicable. From the view-
point of variational calculus, the quantum system must satisfy the following variational condi-
tion.
δ
[
〈Ψ|Hˆ|Ψ〉 − E〈Ψ|Ψ〉
]
= 0 (127)
Here E is the lagrangian multiplier, and its physical meaning is the total energy of the system.
The analytical solution of the above variational problem leads to the following partial differen-
tial equation.
HˆΨ = EΨ (128)
The solution of the above eigenvalue problem yields the energy (E), as the eigenvalue, that is
required for ground or excited states, and corresponding wave functions (Ψ). In computation,
periodic boundary conditions are adopted for simulate infinite systems, and hence an energy
cutoff is introduced for computation efficiency. Mathematically, this cutoff sets how many
terms would be included in the Fourier series, i.e. superposition of plane waves.
The exact solution of the Schro¨dinger equation for the many-body problem are unattainable, and
hence the density functional theory (DFT) is introduced to solve the Schro¨dinger equation as a

method to compare with the hydrogen-carbon systems. Figure 5(a) shows the atomic config-
uration of the C60 fullerene under 10 GPa pressure at 300 K. It can be seen that the it is not
a perfect fullerene in terms of the shape of the hexagons and pentagons, but it is nevertheless
stable in the high pressure environment. Figure 5(b) shows the pressure and volume of the
fullerene. As can be seen, after about 500 time steps (0.1 femto seconds per step), the system
is stabilized. Pressure is maintained at the 10 GPa as specified, and the volume, calculated by
approximating as a sphere, remains constant at equilibrium.
When considering hydrogen atoms are embedded in the fullerene, one first manually assigns
coordinates of the hydrogen atoms, as shown in Figure 6(a). Table 1 shows studied cases in this
project. This arbitrary assignment of the hydrogen atoms cannot satisfy energy minimization.
Hence, the conjugate gradient (CG) method is adopted to relax the system before actual MD
runs. After CG, the atomic configuration of the H6@C60 system is shown in Figure 6(b).
It can be seen that the hydrogen atoms are paired up to form H2 molecules, which gives the
lowest possible energy state for the hydrogen-carbon system. The trace of the CG convergence
is shown in Figure 4. After about 30 convergence steps, the system has reached the desired
convergence. The same methodology is applied to other hydrogen-carbon fullerene systems. In
this work, we have studied 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 hydrogen atoms in the C60 fullerene.
In order to study the filling and release mechanisms of how to put hydrogen inside the fullerene,
or get the hydrogen out of the fullerene, high pressure QMD is simulated. Figure 8(a) shows the
initial state of the hydrogen outside of the fullerene. Under 10 GPa pressure and at 300 K, Figure
8(b) shows the diffusion of the hydrogen atom into the fullerene with the QMD run. However,
longer simulation results show that the fullerene may be damaged due to this hydrogen diffusion
process. Further research is needed to clarify the filling mechanism by increasing pressure. To
release hydrogen, one may increase temperature so that the carbon-carbon equilibrium distance
may increase for hydrogen to sneak out.
Hydrogen storage in carbon nano-cages provides an important route for future hydrogen econ-
omy. Although the present work only tests the number of hydrogen up to 10, in the literature
there has been reported that about 50 hydrogen atoms can be squeezed into the C60 nanocage.
It is been shown that the fullerene with four hydrogen atoms inside reaches the lowest formation
energy. By increasing the pressure, it is possible to push hydrogen into the fullerene, but the
stability of the hydrogen-carbon system at high pressure requires further investigation.
The number of hydrogen atoms in the fullerene we simulate that can reach 10 atoms, means 5
hydrogen molecules, in CG although the hydrogen atoms can reach 14 even 16, but in QMD
the fullerene will broken and hydrogen will run out of the fullerene. Here we try using the
formation energy of the endohedral fullerene containing n hydrogen atoms to understand the
energy in different n. Formation energy of hydrogen in the fullerene, as shown in Figure 7. The
Formation energy is defined as
∆E = E(Hn@C60)− E(C60)− n2 (H2) (132)

models are shown in (c) and (d). In conventional molecular dynamics simulation, an inter-
atomic potential needs to be selected in priori. The AIREBO potential is adopted, along with
LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulator, and the NPT ensemble is chosen, where the pressure
is set to be 1 atm. The AIREBO abbreviation stands for the Adaptive Intermolecular Reactive
Empirical Bond Order (AIREBO) potential, and it is designed for a system of carbon and/or
hydrogen atoms. The AIREBO potential is related to REBO (Reactive Empirical Bond Order)
developed by Brenner.
Figure 15 (a) shows the tip vibration under thermal noise without hydrogen at 1 K, and (b)
shows vibration amplitudes with 912 hydrogen molecules at 300 K. At the temperature of 1 K,
the thermal energy is small, and hence the vibration amplitude of the tube is limited, following
its natural frequency. At room temperature, the thermal vibration is more pronounce, and the
collision between the tube and its hydrogen surrounding may reduce the vibration amplitude.
Without hydrogen environment, the thermal vibration of nanotubes can be further studied. In
Figure 16, a 3-nm long carbon nanotube is under thermal vibration at 300 K. Both of the vibra-
tion amplitudes along the x- and y-direction are recorded in (a) and (c). Their Fourier spectrums
are shown in (b) and (d), respectively. Due to the short length, the frequency spectrums contain
only two main contributions. The Young’s modulus of the tube can be estimated by using the
variance of the vibration amplitudes, shown in Eq. 103.
Compare to a long CNT, with a length of 12 nm, at 1 K, Figure 17 shows much reduced vibration
amplitudes, and their Fourier spectrums contain many other frequency components, presumably
from modes associated to long length and rigidity due to low temperature. When at 300 K, with
the same 12 nm length, Figure 18 shows greater thermal vibration amplitudes, and cleaner fre-
quency spectrums due to flexibility of the CNT at higher temperature. When considering bond
order, Figure 19 a slightly different spectrums, indicating the effects of bond order have been
considered in both Figure 18 and Figure 19. It is necessary to consider the bond order effects
in the analysis of carbon nanotubes due to their carbon interactions. At even higher tempera-
ture, 1000 K, Figure 20 shows large thermal vibration, with similar frequency spectrums. The
relaxation time to reach thermal equilibrium depending on the choice of ensemble.
7 Summary and outlook
