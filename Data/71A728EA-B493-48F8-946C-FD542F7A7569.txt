 Since the female mortality rate of breast cancer is fast growing in recent years, 
breast lesion detection in terms of mammogram and ultrasonic imaging technique has played 
an important role in clinical medicine for an early diagnosis of the existence of malignant 
tumors. For a computer aided diagnosis system, the most significant features used to 
discriminate the malignant tumors from benign tumors are the geometric characteristics of 
tumor’s boundary. In obtaining the geometric features, conventional methods require huge 
computational load including the statistics of the tumor boundary slope variations, the 
convexity and the concavity of the boundary curve, the compactness of the boundary curve 
and a determined ellipsoid, the symmetry of the boundary curve and so forth. Plus the 
discrimination rate is not impressive. In this proposal, we propose a new novel approach. 
This new method is based on the wavelet transformation. The smoothness of the boundary 
curve is correlated with the energy of the wavelet transformed high band coefficients. So this 
new method discriminates malignant tumors by the energy left in the high bands. And the 
new method is more concise and more precise than conventional approaches. Moreover, we 
have designed a VLSI platform to support this energy discrimination method. We can obtain 
all the high band information at one time instead of obtaining high band information 
recursively.

For without losing the generality, a set of b eas  US images derived from 160 
female patients is used in thesecond experiment. It is pathologically proven that 
91 of them belong to nign case (i.e., 42 cysts and 49 fibroadenomas) and the others 
belong to malignant case (i.e., carcinomas). The contours of breast lesions drawn 
by experienced radiologist have the number of original sampling points varying from 
48 to 932. For normalization, each con our shape curve is re-sampled into 
sampling points. Using the radiu  representation [19], each 2-D breast lesion curve 
can be converted to a 1-D peri dic discrete signal. The channel energy  used as
the desired feature is defined by

of all stages of the 160 breast lesion curves are mea ured with the mean values being 
shown in Fig. 6. The energy distribution of Fig. 6 clearly reveals that malignant 
lesions with rougher boundary than b nign lesions will be inhered n larger amount 
channel energy for each frequency band and large difference only exists in several 
low-resolution channels (i.e.,  and 11)  For feature selection, two 
desirable objectives should be concerned [20]. One is to reduc  the imensionality 
of feature space in order to min mize the verall cost of measurement acquisition. 
The other is to maximize the inter-class distance between classes and minimize the 
intra-class distance within each class as possible in order to have high recognition 
performance. For this purpose, pattern distributions in the two feature spaces  
and  are investigated and hetwo kinds of distances can be used as the

For classification efficacy evaluation, sev ral semantic features commonly used 
for benign and malignant breast esio sdiscrimination are explored. The equivalent 
circle area (ECA) feature used in the automatic breast lesion diagnosis ystem [21] 
is defined as , where A and P denote the area and circumference length of the 
lesion shape, respectively. The ll ptic-normalized circumference (ENC) featur  
measured to have the best performance in [22] is defined as , wh re  and 
 denote the circumference lengths of original lesion shape and an equivalent 
ellipse, respectively. The equivalent ellipse is defined to have the same area as 
the original lesion shape. Given the longest radius a and the hortest radius b, there 
exist two methods that can be used to find the parameter . The theoretic value
