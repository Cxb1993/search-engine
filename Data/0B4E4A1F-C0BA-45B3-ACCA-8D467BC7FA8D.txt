2(IR) which detects the signal from one user while treating
the others as interference for a single-user case. The other is
multi-user detection approach (MUD) which detects all
signals simultaneously. In MUD algorithms, the multiple
cochannel signal arriving at an antenna array is extracted.
This occurs in channel reuse-within-cell (RWC) (also
sometimes called space-division multiple access (SDMA)
applications or in situations where we attempt to demodulate
the interference signal in order to improve interference
suppression. Generally, the MUD approach performs much
better than the IR approach.
Two popular optimality criteria in space-time
processing is maximum likelihood (ML) (usually referred as
maximum likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE)),
minimum mean-squared error (MMSE). In theory (assuming
perfect channel estimations), MLSE-ST will outperform
MMSE-ST, particularly when there is significant ISI;
however, there are particular difficulties in implementing
MLSE-ST in the presence of CCI. For a CCI-dominated
channel, MMSE-ST appears to be preferable [1]. Nonlinear
detectors using decision-feedback equalization (DFE) will
improve the performance of their linear MMSE counterparts,
offering reduced complexity (as compared to MLSE
detectors) and ease of adaptation. Another optimality
criterion for ST design is to use the minimum bit error rate
(MBER) criterion [2]-[5]. Through better results can be
obtained in terms of this criterion, the convergence rate may
be slower and the computational complexity may be higher.
All these may make the MBER equalizer less effective in
time-varying channels [7].
Several IR schemes are considered to cancel cochannel
interference (CCI) using in a TDMA system [6]-[13]. In [6],
optimum MMSE linear diversity combining has been shown
to be an effective structure for cancelling ISI and CCI. Its
decision-feedback (DF) counterpart was considered in [8].
These two optimum schemes serve as benchmarks which
can be used to resolve any potential issues in developing a
practical ST receiver with sub-optimal algorithms. IR
schemes with an MMSE equalizer on each antenna branch
were proposed [10]-[16] for TDMA and CDMA systems.
Maximum likelihood sequence detection (MLSE) is used to
improve the performance of ST receiver in [17]. A number
of multiuser detection (MUD) linear and nonlinear schemes
for cochannel signals have been proposed for asynchronous
CDMA systems [18]-[23] and synchronous CDMA systems
[24]-[25]. A MBER space-time decision feedback multiuser
detection in SDMA systems in [26]. Unlike a CDMA system
in which each user is spread by user-specific spreading code,
an SDMA system differentiates each user by the associated
unique user-specific channel impulse response (CIR)
encountered at the receiver antennas. The CIR-signatures are
not orthogonal to each other. Due to the non-orthogonal
nature of the CIRs, an effective IR or MUD receiver is
required for separating the users.
In general, no pulse shaping filter, modulation and
fading effect were taken into account in the above previous
work. The approach may be not practical for the application
of the communication systems. In practice, for symbol
waveforms (pulse shaping) with small excess bandwidth, the
temporal channel for signal and CCI will not be well
separated and channel matrix will be ill conditioned [1][19].
Therefore, CCI cancellation will lead to excessive noise
enhancement, unlike the CDMA system in which each user
uses different symbol waveforms. Multiple antennas should
be used for improved performance in SDMA systems. ST
processing will cancel CCI primarily in the spatial
dimension and ISI in the space to time dimension depending
on where it can handle this more efficiently. The use of
decision-feedback detection can reduce the noise
enhancement and improve the performance of ST processing
with lower complexity than MLSE.
In an AWGN channel, the decision feedback
equalization (DFE) is shown to be optimum using anti-
causal symbol-spaced feedforward filter (FFF). In the
presence of CCI, the results in [13] show that with anti-
causal symbol-spaced FFF the ST-DF-IR receiver using the
optimum structure (e.g. [8][9]) and suboptimum structure
(e.g. [7][17][26]) have worse performance. This is an area
needs more study. The optimum IR structure with double-
sided FFF was proposed to combat CCI in [8]. The use of the
fractionally-spaced FFF can resolve the problem in
[7][17][26] and achieve satisfied performance with lower
complexity than the optimum ST-DF-IR in [9]. Hence, the
use of single-sided and double-sided DFE is an issue of
interest for ST processing. The major objective of this
paper is to extend the previous study to MUD
applications and find the rules for designing MMSE
decision feedback detection operating in SDMA systems to
achieve satisfactory performance while space-time process is
used. Minimizing MSE at the detector input is a feasible
optimization, and often tends toward the minimum BER
solution. In our simulation, the frequency-selective channel
is characterized by a 2-ray Rayleigh fading model and the
error probability is accessed via semi-analytic technology
using Gauss quadrature rules (GQR) based on the method of
moments. This method can approximate the probability
density function (pdf) of the combined ISI and CCI based on
the impulse responses of the desired and CCI signals along
with the noise at the output of the ST detector.
Optimum space-time multiuser decision-feedback detection
(OST-DF-MUD)
An optimal MUD receiver consists of front-end filters,
each matched to each cochannel user on each diversity path,
regardless of the criterion of optimality [6][19]. For each
detector, the outputs from each user are summed and passed
a symbol-spaced feedforward filter (FFF), as shown in Fig.
1. On the kth diversity, the impulse response of the matched
filter corresponding to the jth user is denoted by
. The response from the ith source to the jth
receiver filter on the kth branch for the ith user is denoted by
; the impulse response of the traversal filter
bank corresponding to the jth user of the ith detector denoted
by , is of finite length with delay T between taps.
Adding the sampled responses of all diversity paths
results in a discrete-time response

finite terms. The input of the jth traversal filter at is

by averaging the performance over all possible varying

moments of the joint ISI and CCI, and then performs the

三、結果與討論
We present graphs that show the average symbol error
probability versus average SNR in a fading environment.
Fig. 3 shows the average probability of symbol error versus
SNR for MMSE OST-LD-MUD for different tap length.
With a single antenna, the curves appear very high and
irreducible at SNR higher values due to the fact the temporal
channel for signal and MAI will not be well separated and
the channel will be ill conditioned, and thus leading to
excessive noise enhancement. The performance is improved
significantly with the use of two antennas. When the length
of taps is short, the performance is irreducible due to larger
residual ISI/MAI. There is no further improvement in the
performance when the taps of the MUD-STLE are greater
than 11 for the two-antenna case. The noise is enlarged
remarkably under certain channel conditions when the FFF
bank intends to suppress MAI in the MAI-dominant channel
for a single-antenna case.

6with anti-causal symbol-spaced FFFs, was discussed for
CDMA systems in [14].
Next we consider the ST-DF receiver, which is
composed of a single-sided or double-sided fractionally-
spaced FFF corresponding to each branch, as discussed in
[9][17][10]. Fig. 5 demonstrates the average probability of
symbol error versus SNR for ST-DF-MUD and ST-DF-IR
with single-sided and double-sided symbol-spaced DFE.
With a single antenna, the curves appear high and irreducible
at SNR higher values in either single-sided or double-sided
FFF case and has worse performance than the optimal case.
The performance is improved significantly with the use of
two antennas. As expected, our results show the double-
sided ST-SSDF receiver performs almost as well as (slightly
worse) the optimum ST-SSDF receiver, in MUD and IR
cases. However, it is noted that with the single-sided
anticausal symbol-spaced FFF, the ST-DFE even performs
worse than the ST-LD in the two-antenna case when the
continuous transmitted pulse shape is considered, even
though the successive MAI cancellation scheme is
considered.
Fig. 6 shows the average probability of symbol error
versus SNR for ST-FSDF-MUD and ST-FSDF-IR. Our
results show that the ST-FSDF performs well either in the IR
or MUD cases. With no diversity, the one-sided DFD
performs well, since it can approach the optimum structure,
the CCI can be eliminated. With the use of FSDFD, the
performance in the IR case is improved significantly,
aseptically for one-sided case. The curves appear high and
irreducible at SNR higher values, even with oversampling
due to noise enhancement. It is noted that the double-sided
FFF outperforms the single-sided FFF in the IR case.
However, the double-sided FFF is only slightly better than
the single-sided FFF in the MUD case, similar to the
optimum case. In theory, the optimum ST-DF-MUD using a
single-sided FFF and double-sided FFF can be closed using
this structure. Unlike the SNR =10 dB, the double-sided has
better ability in cancel the CCI in our CCI-dominated
channel. It is noted that without the decision feedback from
other users, the two-sided STDFE still performs well and can
work as a good interference-rejection (IR) approach. This is
due to the fact that two-sided STDFE can be seen as an
equivalent structure of STLE, which is able to eliminate all
MAI and precursive ISI, in combination with a FBF to
cancel postcursive ISI.
This research has presented the analysis of the
optimum finite-length multiuser ST-DFD for a multiple-
antenna receiver in SDMA systems over fading channels.
Our analysis accounts for pulse waveform, modulation and
dispersive fading of the desired signal as well as the MAI.
With a suitable processing, the DFD can further improve
immunity to ISI/MAI and achieve satisfactory performance
in an SDMA system, in addition to excellent immunity to the
effect of noise enhancement. The use of GQR demonstrates
the robust accuracy and speed in simulation. The main
important contributions are summarized as follows:
1. For an optimal MMSE ST-DF structures with single-
sided symbol-spaced FFF, the performance in interfer-
ence rejection is worse, however, the use of MUD can
achieve the optimum performance. The use of double-
sided FFF can improve the performance of ST-DF-IR.
Moreover, ST-DF-MUD with single-sided and double
sided FFF generates almost the same performance. With
double-sided FFF, the MUD receiver performs slightly
better than that with one-sided anticausal FFF, but
requires longer time span.
2. For the suboptimal ST-DF, with single-sided symbol-
spaced FFF, MMSE ST-DF-IR scheme or MUD schemes
has worse scheme, when the continuous transmitted
pulse shape is considered, even though MUD successive
MAI cancellation schemes are considered. The use of
fractionally-spaced DFE can improve the performance
significantly. After some tests, we confirmed that the use
of the double-sided FFF can suppress CCI well when
CCI is dominant either using fractionally-spaced or sym-
bol-spaced in IR case.
3. The use of the fractionally-spaced FFF to either one-
sided DFE or two-sided STDFE can achieve the satisfied
performance with lower complexity than the optimum
ST-DFD for the purpose of interference rejection. For
ST-FS-IR, the two-sided method is better than the single-
sided method. However, for MUD, two-sided ST-FSDFE
and single-sided ST-FSDFE has similar performance.
4. Compared to the results of the AWGN case (with no
MAI), the multiuser ST-DFD has better performance
than MUD-STLE in the presence of MAI. Our results
show approximately two more orders of degradation in
the average SEP for the multiuser ST-LD, but only one
order of degradation for the MUD-STDFE in the two-
antenna case. At high SNR, the ST-DF-MUD provide
about 4~7dB improvement than multiuser ST-LD while
DFD only provide 2~3dB improvement than the LD in an
AWGN channel.
5. With the fractionally-spaced FFF either single-sided and
double-sided, the ST-DF-MUD receiver can approximate
the performance of optimum reception. Moreover, the
double-sided receiver is better than single-sided receiver
in ST-DF-IR case and is capable of providing perfor-
mance close to ST-DF-MUD.

Optimum Finite-length Space-time Decision Feedback Equalization with Multiuser
Detection in SDMA Systems over Fading Channels

Optimum Finite-length Space-time Decision Feedback
Equalization with Multiuser Detection in SDMA
Systems over Fading Channels
Sheng-Chou Lin*
AbstractWe study a design of optimum finite-length space-
time decision feedback equalization (STDFE) assisted multiuser
detection (MUD) in space division multiple access (SDMA)
systems to improve system capacity over fading channels. The
MUD-STDFE receiver uses multi-dimensional finite-length
anticausal symbol-spaced feedforward filter (FFF) and multi-
dimensional feedback filter (FBF), where the optimality
criterion is minimum mean-squared error (MMSE). This space-
time DFE combined with MUD technology is capable of
improving the performance significantly in a SDMA system.
The algorithm for computing the tap coefficients of STDFE-
MUD is presented and then applied to the fast error probability
calculation using the Gauss quadrature rule (GQR), which
offers accuracy as well as considerable saving of computer time.
I. INTRODUCTION
The performance characteristics of multiple-access channels
featuring traditional demodulation techniques are limited by
multiple-access interference (MAI). It can be shown, however,
that such limitations are largely due to the use of nonoptimal
signal processing in the demodulator and are not due to
fundamental characteristics of the channel. Multiuser detection
(MUD) seeks to remove this MAI limitation by the use of
appropriate signal processing. In a CDMA system, each user is
spread by user-specific spreading code. The performance of
multiuser detection (MUD) schemes for cochannel signals has
been studied in spread-spectrum communications where a
number of approaches have been proposed for the special case
of asynchronous CDMA systems [1]-[5]. Multiuser detection
(MUD) techniques has shown that, for reasonably high symbol-
energy-to-noise ratios, performance is very near single-user
communications with the optimal multiuser detector [1]. An
SDMA system differentiates each user by the associated unique
user-specific channel impulse response (CIR) encountered at the
receiver antennas, but the CIR-signatures are not orthogonal to
each other. Due to the non-orthogonal nature of the CIRs, an
effective multiuser receiver is needed to separate the users in an
SDMA system. In combination with antenna arrays, this
technology can be employed for further increasing the available
system capacity in digital mobile radio systems.
In a single-user system, optimum MMSE linear diversity
combining has been shown to be an effective structure for
cancelling ISI and CCI in [6]. Sophisticated equalizers, e.g.
decision-feedback equalization (DFE) or maximum likelihood
sequence detector (MLSE) are used to improve the performance
of space-time (ST) receiver [7]-[11]. Another strategy for
equalizer design is to use the minimum bit error rate (MBER)
criterion [12]-[14]. Through better results can be obtained in
terms of the MBER criterion, the convergence rate may be
slower and the computational complexity may be higher [15].
Those ST single-user detection techniques can be extended to
multiuser detection (MUD) systems. The linear multiuser
equalizers often provided a reasonable trade-off between
detector complexity and performance. However, successive
cancellation schemes may be employed as an alternative to
linear multiuser techniques to further improve performance at
some additional cost in complexity. Use of successive
cancellation to remove MAI is similar to DFE in single-user
settings to remove ISI. In this sense, DFEs constitute a particular
class of successive cancellation schemes that remove MAI and
ISI based on hard estimates of detected symbols. A MMSE
MUD-DFE for fixed channel that is a generalization of its
single-user counterpart was derived in [4][16]. The derivation in
the D-transform domains is too complicated and therefore
becomes impractical in simulation. In MBER MUD-DFE
discussed in [17], the choice of ST-DFE may not be optimal, but
just guarantee an adequate performance, since all postcursive
terms were assumed to vanish before optimization.
Generally, no pulse shaping filter, modulation and fading
effect were taken into account in most of the previous work.
Such an approach may be not practical for the application of
communication systems and even has worse performance than
the linear MUD due to nonoptimal STDFE processing. Against
this background, the novelty of this paper is that the calculation
and performance analysis of optimal finite-length MMSE
STDFE with MUD are presented for the first time in the
literature in the context of practical SDMA communication
systems. The MMSE DFE scheme is an attractive compromise
between complexity and performance also in the MUD case.
The error probability is accessed via semi-analytic technique
using Gauss quadrature rules (GQR) based on the method of
moments. This method can approximate the probability density
function (pdf) of the combined ISI and MAI based on the
impulse responses of the desired and MAI signals along with the
noise at the output of the ST detector. The methods used for the
estimation of error probability are too complex [10], inaccurate
[9][11] or time-consuming [10][15] for severely dispersive
channels, compared to the GQR method.
II. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
The system is modeled assuming that L users transmit QAM
signal over the frequency-selective multipath fading channels to
a multiuser detection (MUD) receiver with K diversity antennas.

result, simpler suboptimal criteria such as MMSE is usually
selected. It is convenient to represent the discrete-time pulse
responses defined in Eq. (1) as an matrix
. The
matrix of the linear transversal filter bank can be represented by
. The optimum solution of the transversal filter
relies on the equation
(6)
where denotes the conjugate transpose operator; for the
GQR method, the precise probability of error can be calculated
from the equalized pulses as well as the equalized noise power.
The vector of the equalized pulses of user i is denoted by
and we have
, where represents the tap
vector of the ith user. The equalized pulses from all users at the
output of user i can be written as
. (7)
where . The equalized noise power of user i is
(8)
Even though the noise at each diversity branch is statically
independent, noises at the outputs of equalizers are correlated
for each user since they come from the same noise source on
each diversity path.
B. MUD Space-time DFE (MUD-STDFE)
Unlike interference cancellation for single-user STDFE [7]-
[11], DFE in a multiuser setting uses past decisions from all
users in order to remove ISI and MAI, as shown in Fig. 1. A
bank of matched filters is followed by a bank of feedforward
transversal filters (FFF) which are anti-causal. After
combining, a bank of causal decision-feedback filters (FBF),
each corresponding to the signal source i, is used to subtract out
those portions of ISI and MAI produced by previously detected
symbols from the estimates of future samples of all users. The
output of user i at time can be expressed as
(9)
where and are the weight coefficients of the
anticausal feed-forward and causal feedback filters separately
for the ith user; and represent the length of the FFF and
FBF; and represent the finite-length convolution
operations from to 0 and from 1 to , respectively.
When designing DFEs, it is assumed that all the past decisions
are correct; this implies that the equalizer is operating at a
sufficiently high-SNR that the decisions it makes are correct
with high probability. The multi-dimensional feedback filter
bank is used to remove posticursive ISI and MAI from the
present estimate caused by previously detected symbols of all
users. Therefore, we have
(10)
where and is the matrix of the FFF bank.
We can obtain the multi-dimensional feedforward filter for
each user by solving the set of linear equations
(11)
where we note and .
Similarly, the vector of the equalized pulses of user i is given
by and we
have , where represents
the tap vector of the FFF for the ith user. The equalized pulses
from all users for user i can be written as
, and . (12)
i.e. for , provided that previous
decisions are correct. Similarly, the equalized noise power for
the ith user is given by
(13)
The use of a DFE can reduce the effect of noise enhancement at
the frequency band while eliminating both ISI and MAI for this
MUD scheme.
III. ERROR PROBABILITY ESTIMATION
Average performance due to fading effects is evaluated by
averaging the performance over all possible varying channel
parameters. The individual run for each fading channel has to
be computationally efficient and accurate. We here use a
method which can fulfill the requirements for efficiency and
accuracy. We start with the estimate of the symbol for user i,
which can be expressed as
(14)
where are the complex-
valued equalized responses. Output noise samples are denoted
by where and are identically
distributed Gaussian random variables having the same
variance equal to . With a slight change in signal
indexing, we can denote the joint ISI and MAI in the in-phase

V. CONCLUSION
This paper has presented the analysis of an optimum finite-
length MUD-STDFE for a multiple-antenna receiver in SDMA
systems over fading channels. Our analysis accounts for pulse
waveform, modulation and fading of the signal and MAI. The
use of GQR demonstrates the robust accuracy and speed in
simulation. We derive the explicit expressions for the MMSE
MUD-STDFE and demonstrate comparative performance with
MUD-STLE. With such a MUD scheme, STDFE using a bank
of anticausal symbol-spaced FFF can further improve
immunity to ISI/MAI and achieve satisfactory performance in
an SDMA system, when the number of antennas is higher than
the number of interferers. The results provide space-time
processing for interference rejection with an important
performance benchmark while designing a practical system.
