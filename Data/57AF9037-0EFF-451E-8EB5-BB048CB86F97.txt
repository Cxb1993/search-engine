yeast extract and 1.5% agar, which has been prepared on the button of a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask. 
Spores of 8-10 day culture are suspended with 100 mL of sterilized 0.02% Tween-80. An aliquot of 
spore suspension is inoculated to a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask containing culture medium and the 
resulted 300-mL culture consists of 5% sucrose, 2% YAE (pH 6) and 106 spore/mL. After 16 h of 
shaken cultivation at 150 rpm in a 30ºC incubator, the culture is used as the seed culture for the 
batch or fed-batch fermentation in a 5-L stir tank bioreactor to produce FTase. 
A. niger and A. oryzae are cultured by the similar procedures as above described. However, 
the shake-flask culture of Aureobasidium is inoculated with the whole suspension of cells grown on 
agar plate. After cultivation at 30ºC and 150 rpm for 36 h, this is used as the seed culture for the 
fermentation carried out in bioreactor. 
 
Batch fermentation (BF) 
 
BF is performed in a 5-L bioreactor at 30ºC and 300 rpm with a working volume of 3 L. The 
culture medium consists of 2% YAE, 0.5% K2HPO4, 0.02% MgSO4•7H2O and sucrose in 
concentration of 20% or 25%. During the fermentation the pH of the culture is controlled at 5.0 by 
automatically adding 5 N NaOH. 
 
Fed-batch fermentation (FF) 
 
FF is carried in a 5-L bioreactor at 30ºC and 300 rpm with an initial volume of 2 L. The 
culture medium is composed of 3% YAE, 0.75% K2HPO4, 0.03% MgSO4•7H2O (pH 6). After the 
inoculation of seed culture, one liter of 75% or 90% sucrose solution is fed into the bioreactor at a 
rate of 27.8-41.7 mL/h and the total concentration of sucrose in the final culture is to be 25% and 
30%, respectively. 
 
Analytical methods 
 
Carbohydrates in the fermentation broth of A. japonicus or in the reaction mixture for FTase 
activity assay are determined by HPLC with an Asahipak NH2P-50 2D (2 × 150 mm) column 
(Shodex) and a refractive index detector. The mobile phase is ACN:water (75:25) at 0.2 mL/min. 
Prior to HPLC analysis, the adequately diluted carbohydrate solution is always mixed with three 
volumes of ACN and filtered through a syringe filter with the pore size of 0.2 μm. 
To measure the FTase activity, twenty milliliters of culture is homogenized using an IKA T-18 
homogenizer. After mixing 0.1 mL of this homogenate with 9.9 mL of 50% sucrose in 0.1 M 
sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.5), the reaction is carried out at 55˚C for 30 min. Then it is heated in 
boiling water to terminate the enzyme reaction. One unit of FTase activity is defined as the amount 
of enzyme required to produce one micromole of 1-kestose per minute. 
Dry cell weight (DCW) of the fungus is determined by filtering 20 mL of submerged culture 
through a Whatman no.41 filter paper, washed with water and dried at 60ºC to constant weight.

processes with feeding rates at 33.3 and 27.8 mL/h were carried out, maximum FTase activities of 
627 and 678 U/mL, at 39 and 60 h were achieved, respectively. Compared with BF using 25% of 
initial sucrose as substrate, FF always gave higher FTase activity. Moreover, higher productivity 
was achieved, when sucrose feeding completed in 24 h. 
Figures 4 and 5 showed the time courses of FTase, biomass and sugar composition in the FF 
processes at a feeding rate of 27.8 mL/h, with total sucrose of 25% and 30%, respectively. FOS 
peaked after 8 h of fermentation and declined thereafter. The total FOS concentration was much 
lower than that in BF processes (figures 2 and 3). However, sucrose increased gradually and peaked 
at 36 h, indicating sucrose-consuming was always slower than sucrose-feeding, because 
sucrose-feeding completed at 36 h, too. When same amount of sucrose was used, compared with BF, 
FF sustained sucrose longer in the culture broth. Consequently, more FTase was induced. FF with 
total sucrose concentration of 25% and 30% gave maximum FTase activities of 678 U/mL (at 60 h) 
and 922 U/mL (at 60h), respectively. Compared with BF, FF allowed more sucrose and FOS to 
induce FTase and more sucrose as high as 30% of total concentration could be added to the culture 
medium. The overall effect resulted in the increase of FTase activity by a factor of 1.74 (from 529 
U/mL to 922 U/mL). 
 
Comparison of FTase production of four fungal strains 
 
Table 2 compared the FTase production of A. japonicus BCRC 93007, A. niger BCRC 32297, 
A. oryzae BCRC 33171 and Aureobasidium sp. BCRC 32364 by BF (5% and 25% of initial sucrose) 
and FF (30% of total sucrose). Compared with that with 25% of initial sucrose, the culture for every 
strain with 5% sucrose gave the smallest FTase activity, suggesting that FTase of four strains were 
inducible. Among these strains, A. japonicus and A. niger produced much more FTase than A. 
oryzae and Aureobasidium sp. The highest activity of FTase was obtained by FF of A. japonicus 
with 30% of total sucrose.. However, A. niger gave the highest productivity of FTase by batch 
fermentation with initial sucrose in concentration of 25%. A. niger produces extracellular FTase 
[22], whereas the FTase of this A. japonicus is cell wall-bounded [4]. FOS can be produced from 
sucrose through the catalytic reaction of the mycelia of A. japonicus by means of membrane-reactor 
or cell-immobilization [16, 23].
