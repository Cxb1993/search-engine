Abstract－In general, a linear maglev rail 
system contains two sub-systems including 
maglev and propulsion systems. In this 
project, an electromagnetic suspension (EMS) 
strategy and a linear induction motor (LIM) 
are utilized for the fundamental levitation 
and propulsion forces of the linear maglev 
rail system. However, inherently unstable 
electromagnetic force and nonlinear attitude 
control of the moving platform in the maglev 
system are two major problems to be solved. 
On the other hand, the corresponding control 
performance of the propulsion system is 
easily influenced due to the normal force 
produced by the maglev system so that the 
coupled dynamic model of the linear maglev 
rail system is highly nonlinear and time 
varying. Therefore, this project is mainly to 
design a linear maglev rail system and to 
analyze its entire coupled behavior including 
electromagnetic dynamic, maglev platform 
dynamic, and propulsion system dynamic. In 
addition, a proportional-integral-differential 
(PID) control system is designed to achieve 
the stable balancing of the maglev platform 
in practical applications.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Nowadays, magnetic levitation (maglev) 
techniques have been respected for 
eliminating friction due to mechanical 
contact, decreasing maintaining cost, and 
achieving high-precision positioning. 
Therefore, they are widely used in various 
fields, such as high-speed trains [1−5], 
magnetic bearings [6, 7], vibration isolation 
systems [8], wind tunnel levitation [9] and 
photolithography steppers [10]. In general, 
maglev techniques can be classified into two 
categories: electrodynamic suspension (EDS) 
and electromagnetic suspension (EMS). EDS 
systems are commonly known as “repulsive 
levitation”, and the corresponding levitation 
sources are produced by superconductivity 
magnets [11] or permanent magnets [12].

where the term fG  is related to the total 
magnetomotive force, coil turns and the 
permeance in the magnetic path. 
According to the Newtonian law, the 
dynamic behavior of this electromagnetic 
system can be governed by the following 
equation:

B.  Maglev System 
In general, six degrees-of-freedom (DOF) 
could be considered in a fully suspended 
substance. For decreasing the hardware cost, 
the transversal electromagnets and gap 
sensors are replaced by transversal auxiliary 
wheels in this project. According to Fig. 3, 
rotating along z-axis and moving in 
y-direction are constricted by transversal 
auxiliary wheels, which will result in little 
friction forces under the rolling situation. 
Therefore, three kinds of motions including 
levitation ( z , moving in z-direction), rolling 
(θ , rotating along x-axis) and pitching (φ , 
rotating along y-axis) should be considered to 
analyze the dynamic model of the maglev 
system. In other words, the mechanical 
behavior is constrained on the side-to-side 
movements, and it only takes the reliance on 
the levitation, roll and pitch into account in 
the dynamic derivation. To regard the 
moving platform as a three-dimensional 
coordinate of the levitation stage, the sketch 
diagram of the maglev system is illustrated in 
Fig. 4, where tl  and tw  are the length and 
width of the moving platform. Oc , which is 
located at z-axis ( 0=x , 0=y ) in the 
three-dimensional coordinate, denotes the 
mass center of the moving platform. Oz  and 
,maxOz  are the central levitation height and its 
maximum limitation. By dividing the moving 
platform equally into four sub-platforms 
labeled as A, B, C and D areas, Ac , Bc , Cc , 
and Dc  represent the mass centers of four 
sub-platforms, and the corresponding 
levitation heights labeled as Az , Bz , Cz , 
and Dz  are measured via gap sensors 
installed in the location of individual mass 
center. ll  and wl  are the horizontal 
distances from the mass centers of four 
sub-platforms to x-axis and y-axis, 
respectively. The applied control forces 
labeled as Af , Bf , Cf , and Df  of four 
sub-platforms are acquired through levitation 
force produced by electromagnets.  
According to (8), the levitation forces 
produced by four electromagnets in this 
maglev system can be arranged as follow:

The dynamic model of the LIM is 
modified from the traditional model of a

[3], the propulsive force can be simplified as 
 lim f limF K i=  (25) 
where fK  is the LIM force constant and 
limi  is the LIM control current. According to 
(24) and (25), the dynamic model of the

because the moving platform is assumed to 
be a rigid body. The relation between the 
control effort and actual control current can 
 the control performance. In general, they are 
determined according to desirable system 
responses, e.g., raising time, settling time, etc. 
With proportional control, it applies a 
corrective force proportional to the tracking 
error for the maglev system, and the gain 
matrix PK  is designed according to the 
amount of initial tracking error. Moreover, 
the integral controller ,c Iu  can alleviate the 
steady-state error, and the gain matrix IK  is 
selected based on the amount of steady-state 
error. In addition, the differential controller 
,c Du  is good for the faster system response 
and the reduction of the tendency to 
overshoot, and the matrix DK  is chosen as 
small as possible to prevent enlarging the 
noise effect.

IV.  EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
The image of the experimental equipment 
for the linear maglev rail system is depicted 
in Fig. 6. In the levitation mechanism, 
EI-type (EI-96) electromagnets are adopted, 
and the coil turns for four electromagnets are 
all chosen as 230. The LIM used in the 
propulsive mechanism is a three-phase 
Y-connected two-pole 1.5kW 60Hz 
110V/10.2A type. The detail parameters of 
the maglev transportation system are listed as 
follows: 
 134mm,t tl w= =  33.5mm,l wl l= =  
,max 5mm,Oz =  14.6kg,lim tM m= =  
113.56kg / s,limD =  86 N/AfK =  (37) 
All experimental computer programs will 
be carried out using Turbo C language 
inserted into a digital-signal-processor (DSP) 
development module. This development 
module has a Texas Instruments 
TMS320LF2407EVM central processing unit, 
16 channel 10-bit analog-to-digital, 4 channel 
12-bit digital-to-analog converters and a 
digital port. The central processing unit has a 
40MIPS 16-bit fixed point DSP core, 2 PWM 
channels with 15kHz, 4 timer channels and 2 
 the central levitation height, rolling and 
pitching angles are affected simultaneously. 
However, the system states still can return to 
the corresponding reference trajectories 
promptly.

V.  CONCLUSIONS 
This project has successfully 
accomplished the fabrication and 
examination of the linear maglev rail system. 
First, it established the dynamic model of an 
electromagnet and extended to analyze the 
maglev platform dynamic by using 
Newtonian law and Lagrange method. 
Moreover, the dynamic model of the LIM 
was derived based on field-oriented control, 
and it combined with the maglev platform 
dynamic to obtain a complete dynamic model 
of the linear maglev rail system. In addition, 
a PID control strategy was implemented to 
balance the platform of maglev system for 
verifying the validity of the manufacturing 
maglev mechanism. The working items 
exceed the expected progress in the original 
proposal. In future research, we will design 
advanced control strategies for dealing with 
the inconvenient gain selections in PID 
control and coping with the possible 
occurrence of system uncertainties in the 
linear maglev rail system. Hopefully, these 
research results could be published on 
famous international journals.

motion mechanism via electromagnetic suspension technique to reduce 
friction force during the linear motion for rising the whole efficiency 
and simplifying the mechanical design procedure. The bottom of this 
mechanism is a motion basal platform and the steel bridge is adopted 
as the rail body. Moreover, the pulse-width-modulation driver is 
utilized for exciting the stator winding of a linear induction motor 
(LIM) fixed on the overhead steel bridge to linkage the conductor plate 
such that the magnetic coupling effect produces the thrust force to 
move the motion platform in horizontal displacement. This 
displacement is measured by a linear encoder. In addition, the fender 
placed at the end of LIM is designed to avoid the problem of collision
and the vertically auxiliary wheels are used to decrease the friction 
force when the motion platform is not suspended completely. In order 
to make the mover suspend, four electromagnets under the bottom of 
the motion platform are adopted in this invention. When the 
electromagnets attract the upper plate of the rail, the motion platform
