to obey a Gaussian distribution. An attempt 
to find an estimate of the parameters of the 
distribution that will best fit the given 
histogram data is made by using the 
least-squares method. It typically leads to a 
nonlinear optimization problem, of which 
the solution is computationally expensive 
and time-consuming. Nonparametric 
approaches find the thresholds that separate 
the gray-level regions of an image in an 
optimum manner according to some 
discriminating criteria such as the 
between-class variance (Otsu, 1979), 
entropy (Kapur et al., 1985) and cross 
entropy (Li and Lee, 1993). Compared to 
the parametric methods, nonparametric 
approaches are more computationally 
efficient and simpler to implement in 
practice. Both parametric and nonparametric 
approaches have one common problem that 
the computational complexity becomes 
exponential when bi-level thresholding is 
extended to multilevel thresholding. Snyder 
et al. (1990) presented an alternative method 
for fitting curves based on a heuristic 
method called tree annealing. Yin (1999) 
proposed a fast scheme for optimal 
thresholding using genetic algorithms. In 
this research, an improvement upon 
Gaussian curve fitting and the Otsu’s 
method is reported that the effectiveness and 
the efficiency of these two optimal 
thresholding methods could be greatly 
enhanced in the case of multilevel 
thresholding. We present a hybrid 
Nelder-Mead simplex search method and 
particle swarm optimization (NM-PSO) to 
solve the objective functions of Gaussian 
curve fitting and the Otsu’s method. 
 
2. Parametric and Nonparametric 
Approaches 
 
A properly normalized multimodal 
histogram ( )p x  of an image, where x 
represents the gray levels, can be fitted with 
the sum of d probability density functions 
(pdf’s) for finding the optimal thresholds for 
use in image segmentation (Snyder, 1990). 
With Gaussian pdf’s, the model has the 
following form: 
2

and

d

p
=

Here, iP  is the priori probability, d is the 
levels of thresholding, iμ  is the mean, and 
2
iσ  is the variance of mode i. A pdf model 
must be fitted to the histogram data, 
typically by the maximum likelihood or 
mean-square error approach in order to 
locate the optimal threshold. Given the 
histogram data ˆ jp  (observed probability of 
gray level j) described below:

     (3) 
where g(j) denotes the occurrence of 
gray-level j over a given image range 
[0,L-1], and L is the total number of gray 
levels. We wish to find a set of parameters, 
Θ , which minimize the fitting error: 
2ˆ ( , )Minimize j j

multi-thresholding. The simplified NM-PSO 
begins with randomly generated the 
population. The population size of this 
hybrid NM-PSO approach is set at 3N+1 
when solving an N-dimensional problem. 
Note that, in Gaussian curve fitting, N is 
3 1d − ; in the Otsu’s method, N is 1d − .The 
initial population is created in two steps: 
using a predetermined starting point, N 
particles are spawned with a positive step 
size of 1.0 in each coordinate direction, and 
the other 2N particles are randomly 
generated. A total of 3N+1 particles are 
sorted by the fitness, and the top N+1 
particles are then fed into the simplex search 
method to improve the (N 1)th+  particle. 
The other 2N particles are adjusted by the 
PSO method by taking into account the 
positions of the N+1 best particles. This 
procedure for adjusting the 2N particles 
involves selection of the global best particle, 
selection of the neighborhood best particles, 
and finally velocity updates. The global best 
particle of the population is determined 
according to the sorted fitness values. The 
neighborhood best particles are selected by 
first evenly dividing 2N particles into N 
neighborhoods and denoting the particle 
with the better fitness value in each 
neighborhood as the neighborhood best 
particle. By the equations of velocity update 
to compute each of the 2N particles is then 
carried out. The 3N+1 particles are sorted in 
preparation for repeating the entire run. The 
process terminates when a certain 
convergence criterion is satisfied. For 
further details of the hybrid NM-PSO, see 
Fan and Zahara (2002). In section 2, we 
have described the parametric approaches 
by Gaussian curve fitting and nonparametric 
approaches by the Otsu’s method. Both 
objective functions (4) and (10) are now 
subjects to being optimized by NM-PSO. 
For example, in bi-level thresholding, 5 
parameters, { }1 1 2 2, , , ,iP μ σ μ σΘ =  and 
2 11P P= − , for Gaussian curve fitting and 1 
parameter, *T , for the Otsu’s method can be 
solved by NM-PSO. 
 
4. Experimental Results 
 
In this section, we evaluate the 
performances of the following methods: the 
Otsu’s method with exhaustive search, and 
the proposed NM-PSO algorithm 
implemented on the Otsu’s method and 
Gaussian curve fitting as objective functions, 
which we shall refer to as NM-PSO-Otsu 
and NM-PSO-Curve, respectively. 
The test images are of size 256 256×  
pixels with 256 gray-levels, taken under 
natural room lighting without the support of 
any special light source. The algorithms are 
implemented on an Athlon XP 
2200+(166×11) with 1GB RAM using 
Matlab. A stopping criterion used for the 
study is 10´N iterations when solving an 
N-dimensional problem. To account for both 
efficiency and effectiveness, the criterion 
10 N×  has been tested with much success 
from previous experiments. Initially, 
parameters iP  for NM-PSO-Curve are set 
at 1/iP d= , iμ ’s are all set to 1.00. Starting 
values of the T parameters for 
NM-PSO-Otsu are selected from the valley 
of arbitrarily two adjacent peaks. The 
 6
that the segmentation difficulty by using the 
Otsu’s method may arise, as the size of 
objects relative to the background is small. 
From Figure 5(f) and Table 6, smoothly 
fitted histograms are formed and the 
threshold values are properly located at the 
valleys that separate the pinholes and 
electric circuit s from the background, with 
a mean square error of 0.0031. 
Figures 6(b) and 6(c) display 
NM-PSO-Otsu (or the Otsu’s method) and 
NM-PSO-Curve thresholding results of a 
complex PCB image, respectively. From 
this test case, a similar conclusion to that 
found in image 5 can be drawn that the 
outlines of the circuits on the lower part of 
the image cannot be clearly segmented by 
using the Otsu’s method because of their 
relative object sizes. Instead, 
NM-PSO-Curve has the competitive edge in 
this regard (see Figure 6(b)). The excellent 
performance of NM-PSO-Curve on image 6 
lies in the third threshold value 3 T at 149, 
as opposed to 175 in the Otsu’s method. 
Figure 6(f) and Table 7 illustrate that 
NM-PSO-Curve fits the original histogram 
well enough, with a mean square error of 
0.0026. 
Table 7 shows that NM-PSO-Otsu and 
the Otsu’s method converge in the same 
amount of time for bi-level thresholding in 
image 4, but for images 5 and 6, 
NM-PSO-Otsu outperforms the Otsu’s 
method in computation time for multilevel 
thresholding. For tri-level and four-level 
thresholding cases, the computation time of 
the Otsu’s method takes about 18 and 570 
times as much as NM-PSO-Otsu, 
respectively. This implies that 
NM-PSO-Otsu can likely be applied in 
real-time for multi-thresholding in that it 
only takes about 0.03 second for four-level 
thresholding. Additionally, in images 4-6 
the efficiency is apparently not our major 
concern, so NM-PSO-Curve is 
recommended for maintaining quality 
outputs despite its expensive computation. If 
the speed is of primary importance rather 
than the effectiveness for a particular 
application (as previously discussed in 
images 1-3), thus NM-PSO-Otsu should be 
adopted. 
 
5. Conclusions 
 
 Although the Otsu’s method is very 
efficient in bi-level thresholding cases, its 
computation time becomes aggravated in the 
case of multilevel thresholding. To make the 
Otsu’s method more practical in on-line 
object segmentation, we have proposed a 
faster searching scheme called 
NM-PSO-Otsu that solve s the Otsu’s 
method objective function using a hybrid 
optimization method. Experimental results 
show that NM-PSO-Otsu can accelerate the 
Otsu’s method in multilevel thresholding for 
real-time applications and does not degrade 
the quality of image segmentation. In 
addition, we have presented an off-line 
object segmentation method called 
NM-PSO-Curve. Comparison results of the 
Otsu’s method to NM-PSO-Curve 
demonstrate that NM-PSO-Curve offers 
higher quality in visualization, object size 
and contrast of image segmentation,
