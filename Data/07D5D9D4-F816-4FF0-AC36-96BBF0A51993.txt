form of the input operator F is
Fu (x, t) = θ(x)u(t− τ(x)). (2)
Suppose a pointed sensor Y that outputs y : [0, T ] → <
and a feedback compensator K between the sensor Y and
the actuator U are properly chosen to establish a closed-loop
servo system. The task of this paper is to synthesize finite-
dimensional observers that take as the information the senor
output y(t), actuator input u(t), plant dynamics of Eq. (1),
and actuation dynamics in Eq. (2) to provide real-time state
estimation of the infinite-dimensional system of Eqs. (1)-(2).
An inner product 〈· , ·〉 is chosen as a metric for the vector
space consisting of real functions φ : Ω→ Rs,
〈φi, φj〉 ≡
∫
Ω
φTj (x)Pφi (x) dx, (3)
so that the linear, self-adjoint operator P renders that the
square of L2 norm of the distributed state w is identical to
the total energy E(t), i.e.
E(t) = 〈w,w〉(t) ≡ ‖w‖2(t), ∀t ∈ [0, T ].
As for the finite-dimensional, real vector space, the inner
product 〈v, u〉 means uT v, which generates the Euclidean
norm, i.e. ‖v‖2 = vT v.
Several types of shorthand are used in this article. For
a dynamical operator G, the symbol G itself is used as
shorthand for its transfer function G : C → Cs. When a
fixed frequency ω is signified, the symbol G is further used
as shorthand for the complex value G(jω). For a signal z,
z(t) denotes its real value in time domain at time t and z(jω)
denotes its complex value in frequency domain at frequency
ω, where
z(jω) ≡ 1√
2pi
∫ ∞

z(t)e−jωtdt, ω ∈ (−∞,∞);
z(t) ≡ 1√
2pi
∫ ∞
−∞
z(jω)ejtωdω, t ∈ [0,∞).
The L2-norm of the signal z, ‖z‖L2 , is defined by ‖z‖

L2
≡∫∞
0
‖z(t)‖2dt, and its H2-norm, ‖z‖H2 , is defined by
‖z‖2H2 ≡
∫∞
−∞ ‖z(jω)‖2dω. Suppose the system G has
the input signal w and output signal z, then the L2-gain
of the system G, ‖G‖L2→L2 , is defined by ‖G‖L2→L2 ≡
sup
w
‖z‖L2/‖w‖L2 , and its H∞-norm, ‖G‖∞, is defined by
‖G‖∞ ≡ sup
w
‖z‖H2/‖w‖H2 . Based on the geometrical
isomorphism between time domain and frequency domain
[7], H2-norm and H∞-norm are identical to L2-norm and
L2-gain, respectively, that is,
‖z‖L2 = ‖z‖H2 ≡ ‖z‖2; ‖G‖∞ = ‖G‖L2→L2 .
III. ORDER-TRUNCATED MODEL
A spatially finite-dimensional model Gˆ obtained from
the space-time infinite-dimensional system G in Eqs. (1)-
(2) is served for observer synthesis. The truncated model is
obtained via performing orthogonal projection of the system
G onto the orthonormal basis that is obtained from proper
orthogonal decomposition (POD). The database D for the
POD is comprised of snapshots (spatial shapes at frozen
times) of the distributed state w, which is randomly collected
from a series of pilot runs on the servo system (G,K),
D = {wk ∈ L2(Ω) : wk(x) = w(x, tk), k = 1, · · · , n}. (4)
This research uses a self-made numerical solver via finite-
difference discretization to generate those snapshots in D.
The program for identifying an orthonormal ba-
sis Φ attached with weighting factors λi’s, Φ =
{(φi, λi) : i = 1, 2, · · · , n}, λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · ≥ λn, is
presented as follows:
(Step 1) Set a tolerance number ε(ε > 0), and collect a
database D as in Eq. (4).
(Step 2) Construct the covariance matrix EC ∈ Rn×n with
the ith-row-jth-column entry being
[EC ]ij = 〈wi, wj〉
and calculate its eigenvalues λ1, λ2, · · ·λn (λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · ≥
λn) and corresponding eigenvectors e1, e2, · · · en (‖ei‖ = 1)
.
(Step 3) Choose the minimum number m(m ≤ n) such
that
λ1 + λ2 + · · ·+ λm
λ1 + λ2 + · · ·+ λm · · ·+ λn ≥ 1− ε.
Stack up two matrices Rˆ and Λˆ by Rˆ =
[
e1 · · · em
]
and Λˆ = diag(λ1, · · · , λm), respectively.
(Step 4) Set φi(x) =
n∑
j=1
[RˆT ]ijwj(x), i = 1, · · · ,m
and denote φˆi as φˆi = φi/‖φi‖.
The above program is resulted from the POD methodology
for distributed parameter systems, which is developed in this
research and manifested in Appendix I.
Let the distributed state w be linearly spanned by the first
m members of Φ, i.e.
w(x, t) ≈ η1(t)φ1(x)+η2(t)φ2(x)+ · · ·+ηm(t)φm(x) (5)
and perform orthogonal projection of Eq. (1) onto to φi for
i = 1, · · · ,m, i.e.〈
∂w
∂t
, φi
〉
= 〈Lw , φi〉+ 〈Fu, φi〉, (6)
where Fu (x, t) = θ(x)u(t − τ(x)) as shown in Eq. (2).
Define a matrix A with theith-row-jth-column entry being
Aij ≡ 〈Lφj , φi〉. Define a set of operators Fi’s such that
Fiu (t) ≡ 〈Fu, φi〉, i = 1, · · · ,m. (7)
Equations (17)-(18) reveal the maximum disturbance u˜max
satisfies ∂H∂u˜ (η˜p, u˜max) = 0 that results in
u˜max = γ−2BTp Zη˜p. (19)
Equation (11) can then be achieved if H(η˜p, u˜max) < 0,
which generates a Riccati inequality:
ATp Z+ZAp−2CTp Cp+QTQ+γ−2ZBpBpZ < 0; Z > 0
that can be transformed into a linear matrix inequality:
LZ(Z, γ2) ≡ (20)
ATp Z + ZAp − 2CTp Cp QT ZBp 0
Q −I 0 0
BTp Z 0 −γ2 0
0 0 0 −Z
 < 0.
The numerical solver of Eq. (20) can be referred to [9]. In
summary, the optimal observing-gain Lp is obtained through
solving Zopt = inf
γ2
LZ(Z, γ2) < 0 and then setting Lp =
ZoptC
T
p . The pair of (Fˆ (s), Lp) defines the L2-gain robust
observer.
V. SIMULATION STUDY
Consider one-dimensional thermoacoustic dynamics
evolving in a bounded domain Ω ∈ [0, L] with spatially
uniform mean-density ρ˜, mean-temperature T˜ and mean-
velocity u˜. Its mathematical formulation can be referred
to Hong [4] and other research papers, e.g. [10] and [11].
Here, we write down its state equation with the perturbed
pressurep′(x, t), perturbed velocity u′(x, t) and perturbed
entropys′(x, t) being the chosen states:
∂p′
∂t
= −u˜ ∂
∂x
p′ − rp˜ ∂
∂x
u′ + rRT˜m′ − (r − 1)Q′; (21)

ρ˜
; (22)
∂s′
∂t
= −u˜ ∂
∂x
s′ +
Q′
T˜ ρ˜
, (23)
where, the effect of viscosity and heat conductivity on
perturbed field is neglected, and m′, f ′ and Q′ denote
respectively the external input of mass rate, force and heat
rate.
If we take the dimensionless variable by
u′ ≡ u
′
u˜
, p′ ≡ p
′
rp˜
, T ′ ≡ T
′
T˜
, s′ ≡ s

rCv
,
x′ ≡ x
L
, t′ ≡ c

and let u˜ and m′ be zero for simplicity, then we have
∂p′
∂t
= −∂u
′
∂x
+Q′; (24)
∂u′
∂t
= −∂p
′
∂x
+ f ′; (25)
∂s′
∂t
= Q′, (26)
where Q′(x, t) = θ(x)u(t − τ(x)). A pointed senor Y1
is used to measure the perturbed pressure every instances
at location x1. Based on the observability analysis, the
perturbed pressure p′ and perturbed velocity u′ everywhere
in Ω can be online detected by an observer connected to the
sensor Y1, however, the perturbed entropy s′(x, t) cannot be
observed in such a way. Therefore, we take only Eqs. (24)
and (25) as the model served for observer design.
In the simulation study, we assign the fraction function
θ by θ(x) = sin(pix), the delay function τ by τ(x) =
sin(0.5pix), the position of the first sensor by x1 = 0.02,
and the feedback compensator K between the sensor Y1
and the actuator U by K(s) = s+2s+1 . Furthermore, the plant
disturbance f ′ is assumed temporally white and spatially
uniform, the operator P in Eq. (3) should be P = I and
the tolerance number is set by ε = 0.05.
POD analysis as discussed above results in 6 dominant
members whose weighting factors λk’s are shown in Figure
2, in which we find that POD possesses excellent capability
of extracting dominant basis. The actuation operators Fi’s
are obtained via numerical integration of Eq. (10). Figures
3-6 show the first four time-delay induced operators and their
approximations Fˆi’s that are needed in installing observer as
shown in Figure 1. In detail,
Fˆ1(s) =
−0.04s2 + 2.65s− 92.16
s2 + 48.6s+ 1250.31
;
Fˆ2(s) =
−0.04s2 + 2.28s− 82.14
s2 + 50.39s+ 1298.47
Fˆ3(s) =
−0.01s3 − 12s2 + 2321s− 272826
s4 + 83s3 + 12352s2 + 473138s+ 21340891
;
Fˆ4(s) =
−2s3 + 330s2 − 34294s+ 1453436
s4 + 135s3 + 17026s2 + 909566s+ 31723357
,
and the shaping filter W between Eq. (11) and Eq. (12)
related to the truncation error F˜ is chosen accordingly.
The synthesizer of robust observers, developed in Section
4, is used to find the L2-gain -optimized observing-gain Lp
with γopt = 0.2. Another senor Y2 is placed at x2 = 0.5
to deliver p′(x2, t) and u′(x2, t) that are plotted in Figure 7
and Figure 8, respectively. The observer (Fˆ , Lp) processes
the actuating signal u(t) and the output of the sensor Y1,
p′(x1, t), to estimate the outputs of the sensor Y2, pˆ′(x2, t)
and uˆ′(x2, t), which are also plotted in Figure 7 and Figure
8, respectively. Figures 7 and 8 show satisfactory closeness
between the directly measured p′(x2, t) and u′(x2, t)and the
observed pˆ′(x2, t) and uˆ′(x2, t). This credits the L2 -gain
synthesizers of robust observers that are firstly developed in
this work.
that is 〈φk, φk〉 = 0 implying φk = 0 almost everywhere
in Ω for all k = p + 1, · · · , n. We never choose zero as a
member of the orthogonal basis. For smooth formulation, we
may technically assign ap+1 = ep+1, · · ·, an = en such that
〈φk, φk〉 = 0 for all k ≥ p+ 1. As a result,
Φ(n) = {φ1, · · ·φn : φi = ei,jwj} (31)
is a proper orthogonal set that contains vectors, including
zero members, in descent order of their norms.
