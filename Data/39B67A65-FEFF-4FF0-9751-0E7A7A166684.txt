摘要 
在本三年期計畫執行中，主要完成兩個主要的研究子題，該研究成果將於本
報告做詳細陳述。於第一年以及第二年，完成了用以描述波浪於孔隙介質中傳播
的延伸型布氏方程式(extended-Boussinesq equation)的推導與數值模式的建立。首
先針對推導所得之新延伸型布氏方程式進行線性與弱非線性特性的數學分析。由
分析過程中可以得知適合用於該數學模式的特性參數與方程式本身的正確性。分
析結果顯示新的延伸型布氏方程式能正確地描述波浪在孔隙結構內的傳播。最後
將數值模式針對不同波浪特性與孔隙介質進行一系列的模擬計算，用以研究波浪
與孔隙物質的交互作用之波浪演變。 
與三維 Navier-Stokes 模式相比，上述模式(水深積分模式)能在中間性水深下
快速地計算出波浪與孔隙結構之交互作用之波浪演變。然而對於更重要的資訊例
如波場速度與波場壓力分布卻無法得知。 
為能兼顧計算效率與局部細節資訊的獲得，一個較為可行的與彈性的辦法應
是採用不同模式的特性來達成研究目的。例如在大尺度範圍底下用布氏方程式來
降低計算資源，而對於小範圍的計算尺度則改採 Navier-Stokes 方程式來獲得重
要的資訊。 
因此為達到提升研究品質與內容之目的，第三年計畫執行內容原本為結合潛
沒式孔隙延伸型布式方程式與立水式 (上述模式) 孔隙延伸型布式方程式來描
述波浪在孔隙海灘上的傳遞更改為以結合孔隙阻力模式與 Navier-Stokes 方程式
推導之多相流方程式來進一步研究波浪與孔隙的交互作用以得到更多的局部細
節。 
大體而言，在計畫執行期間所發展的兩模式能正確地描述波浪與孔隙材質的
交互作用。

Hsiao et al. (2002, 2005) utilized a perturbation approach to develop a new set of 
model equations for nonlinear water waves propagating over a porous bottom with the 
assumption of weak dispersivity. Further, Chen (2006) and later Cruz and Chen (2006) 
extended the equations of Hsiao et al. (2002) to improve the linear dispersive 
properties by including higher order damping terms in porous media. This allows the 
model applicable to deeper water depths. 
 However, when the porous structures are sub-aerial which exists surface-piercing 
boundaries, the model equations proposed by the aforementioned studies are no 
longer valid for the applied boundary conditions are different. Many studies have 
been carried out to investigate how the waves influence the ground water table in the 
context of the ground-water dynamics (e.g., Bear, 1972; Li et al., 2000; Cartwright et 
al., 2003; Teo et al., 2003; Jeng et al., 2005). However, their studies are based on 
Darcy's law and the analyses are limited in one-dimensional cases and impermeable 
flat bottoms which are not suitable for coastal aquifers on uneven topography. Further, 
Liu and Wen (1997) developed a fully nonlinear and weakly dispersive model for 
describing tide-induced waves propagating into porous media based on Darcy's law. 
In particular, one-dimensional analytical solution was derived and numerical results 
were presented. The two-dimensional numerical results were extended by Lynett et al. 
(2000) to investigate the solitary wave interacting with porous structure. In their study, 
the generalized Boussinesq model equations in free-flow region and the weakly 
nonlinear model equations of Liu and Wen (1997) inside porous media were used. A 
more complete mathematical solution using the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator was 
provided by Artiles and Kraenkel (2007). In these models, the inertial force and 
nonlinear drag force are assumed to be negligible, and thus the models cannot be 
applied to the situations in which the velocity of the fluid is significant. 
 The main objective of this paper is to develop a new set of two-horizontal 
dimensions porous sub-aerial model based on Boussinesq-type equations incorporated 
with linear and nonlinear resistance forces. This new model can thus be applied in a 
wider range of water depths and various degrees of permeabilities. This paper is 
organized as follows. The next section describes the derivation of the present porous 
sub-aerial model equations. The numerical schemes are then introduced. Next, the 
linear/nonlinear properties of the present model are compared with the linear wave 
theory and the analytic solution of Liu and Wen (1997). The discrepancies are 
discussed. To see how the new model performs, some preliminary numerical results of 
one-dimensional equations are presented. Finally, brief conclusions are given.

 As shown in Fig. 2-1, the wave trains with free surface displacement ( , )' ' 'x y  
propagate over impermeable bedrock at = ( , )' ' ' 'bz h x y  in the porous layer, where 
( , )' 'x y  are the horizontal coordinates and 'z  is the vertical coordinate. The layer 
above the impermeable bottom is made of permeable materials that are characterized 
by an effective porosity n  and an intrinsic permeability pK . a  is the characteristic 
amplitude, l  the horizontal length-scale, h  the characteristic depth, and /l gh  
the characteristic time scale. The dimensionless variable group is defined as follows,

intrinsic averaged velocity components, and

the inverse of the coefficient of linear resistance force, says pa  and will be 
introduced later. It is noted that the intrinsic averaged velocity is the velocity 
averaging over the volume of fluid phase (e.g., Hsiao et al., 2002). 
 The waves propagating inside the porous media,    , < < , ,bh x y z x y t , can

 Moreover, while no assumptions on the vertical vorticity  s sy xu v  are made, 
the horizontal vorticity is assumed to be weak and is satisfied with the following 
conditions to proceed the derivation

 Substituting Eq. (2.12) into Eqs. (2.2) and (2.9), the equations of the  2O 

second order convective terms in  2O   are downgraded to  4O   and can be 
neglected. On the other hand, the higher order resistance force terms in the porous 
layer, says the terms in  4O   , are thus upgraded to  2O   and should be 
considered. When the median diameter of the particle is larger between 1 cm to 10 cm, 
the scale   increased to   1O   . Consequently, all terms in  4O    is higher 
than  4O  , and no terms can be omitted under this situation which the linear drag 
force, nonlinear drag force and, the inertial force are equally important. As particle 
size increases further, nonlinear drag force and inertial force are dominant. The higher 
order contributions of the resistance force can be reasonably neglected under the 
assumption of  1O  . However, keep all the terms will not loss the accuracy, the 
detailed discussion can be found in Gu and Wang (1991) and Chen (2006). If we 
truncate following governing equations at  2O   and keep the terms of  2O   
and  4O   , then all the governing equations will keep the accuracy up to  2O  . 
 To get the momentum equation, we can substitute Eq. (2.33) into Eq. (2.3), and 
to expand all the variables up to  2O   with employing Eq. (2.29),

depth is in the range from shallow water to intermediate water depth. Therefore, we 
only list the truncated model equation in the next section and code it as the numerical 
model in section Chapter 4. Moreover, notwithstanding the fact that the derived model 
equations are two-dimensional, all simulations presented in this paper are 
one-dimensional.  
2.2 One-dimensional truncated governing equations 
 The one-dimensional model equations can be treated as first order differential 
equation of the dependent variables   and su  in time (e.g., Nwogu, 1993; Wei and 
Kirby, 1995). For convenience, hereafter the notation `prime' in the dimensional 
variables is dropped. They are:

Chapter 3 Fundamental Properties 
 The analysis of the fundamental properties sheds more lights on applicability of 
the present model equations and offers another view of their intrinsic mathematical 
behavior. In this section, the linear and nonlinear characteristics of the model 
equations are examined. In particular, the analyses of the linear properties are carried 
out for determining the optimal depth by comparing the one-dimensional linearized 
model equation and the exact formula. The nonlinear properties of the model 
equations are numerically validated against the weakly nonlinear theory of Liu and 
Wen (1997).

section, we will introduce a parameter and will determine the optimal value to 
understand the properties of present model equations and to provide the using of the 
model simulations further. 
3.2 Determining the optimal depth of the linear model equations 
 The processes of determining the optimal depth z  closely follow that firstly 
proposed by Nwogu (1993). The parameter  , which equals / bz h , is meaningful 
when its value is between -1 and 0. Replacing z  as bh  in Eq. (3.7) and Eq. (3.8),

(1997) analytical solution, the fundamental difference between the model equations is

 The fully nonlinear version of the continuity equation of Liu and Wen is the 
same as that derived in this study (i.e. Eq. (2.31)). On the other hand, Eq. (3.23) can 
be obtained by ignoring some terms of Eq. (2.52). In other words, Liu and Wen's 
model equations are a subset of the present porous sub-aerial model equations. 
 From this viewpoint, the present model equations can better capture the 
nonlinear effects by including more fully nonlinear terms to highlight the importance 
of the inertial force, including the unsteady terms, and allow weak vertical vorticity. 
Furthermore, the unsteady inertial term plays important roles in both the phase speed 
and damping rate. These will be discussed below. 
 Although the set of governing equations of Liu and Wen (1997) is fully nonlinear 
and weakly dispersive, only the weakly nonlinear cases where the analytic solution is 
available are discussed. The dispersion relation based on Liu and Wen's weakly 
nonlinear equations is

 (3.25) 
where a  is the wave amplitude and the notation asterisk the complex conjugate. On 
the other hand, when the water depth is shallow, the exact dispersion relation, Eq. 
(3.21), can be expanded as

 If we consider solely the leading order of Eq. (3.26) and compare it to Eq. (3.24), 
the difference between the two equations is the terms  1 AC  . Specifically, the 
former comes from 
s
tu  and the latter comes from 
s
A tC u  contributed by added-mass, 
which is ignored in Lin and Wen's equations. Mathematically, the equality of the 
leading order of the complex wave number of Eq. (3.24) and Eq. (3.26) for keeping 
the leading order term can be achieved by setting =AC -1. 
22 
 
 To obtain correct results for the wave simulations in a finite computational 
domain, some appropriate boundary conditions are needed. In the present model, 
waves are sent through the inflow boundary, =x  0 m, by specifying the free surface 
displacement at the five points nearest the boundary. More than thirty wave periods 
are necessary to obtain steady state solutions. At outflow boundary, a sponge layer 
with at least one wavelength long is placed at the downward end to minimize the 
computational domain. 
24 
 
applicable water depth is in a range corresponding to shallow water and intermediate 
water depths. 
 The advantages of utilizing the truncated model equations are quite clear. The 
present linearized model equations (Eq. (3.13) and Eq. (3.14)) are first order 
differential equation of the dependent variables   and su  in time and fourth order 
differential equation in space. And the truncated model equation (Eq. (3.13) and by 
setting 
3 0   in Eq. (3.14)). Mathematically, the higher order differential equation 
encounters the instability problem than that in the lower order differential equation. 
Numerically, the numerical codes are more easy to develop for discretizating the 
equation in space. Moreover, the higher order space differential equations bring the 
numerical instability problem and the numerical noise which can make the employing 
of numerical model crashed.  
 The improvement by employing the present linear model equation is not 
expected may reasonably cause by introducing the inadequate scaling parameter and 
the limited knowledge about the velocity profile of water waves propagate in the 
porous layer with very small size particles (the big value of S  under the same wave 
period). However, since the results of linear property analyses show excellent 
agreement with both the present linear model equations and truncated model 
equations when water depth is between shallow water and intermediate water depths. 
Therefore, all the numerical tests in section 5.2 are according to the model equations 
(Eq. (2.54)) which basically omitted the higher order terms ( 2Λ , 3Λ  and 4Λ ) in Eq. 
(2.52) 
 In addition, Tab. 5-1 depicts that the mean error of both the present linear model 
equations and truncated model equations calculated by the constrained least-squares 
equation, Eq. (3.22), is less than 
41.8 10  in the three cases.

shown at top subplot; (2) the non-dimensional free surface displacement of fully 
nonlinear equations, weakly nonlinear equations and Liu and Wen's analytical solution 
at several locations are given in the left column; and (3) the amplitude spectra of the 
non-dimensional free surface elevation of the numerical results are illustrated in the 
right column. For time series plot, time t  is normalized by the wave period T , and 
the free surface elevation   is normalized by the amplitude a  of input signal 
(located at =x  0 m). In the right column, the frequency f  is normalized by the 
wave frequency pf , which equals 1/ T  and the amplitude spectrum, Aˆ , is 
normalized by the amplitude of first harmonic 
1Aˆ  of the reference gauge. Bear in 
mind that the white region is filled with a porous medium and the grey layer denotes 
the impermeable bottom in the top subplot. 
 In the first set of numerical experiments, cases 1(a) to 1(c), long waves with 
wave period =T  30.0 sec and still water depth =bh  0.2 m propagating in the 
porous media with a flat impermeable bottom are carried out, yielding the wave 
length ( L ) being 20.319 m and a relative water depth (
2 / 2bh g  ) being 
41.424 10 . 
Three values of wave height, 
wH  (1.158 to 14.34 cm), giving the wave nonlinearity 
(0.029 to 0.359) defined as the ratio of a half wave height and still water depth, are 
examined to validate the present numerical model. In the model, the length of porous 
layer is about 66 m. At the end, a sponge layer with a length of 22 m is served as the 
absorbing device to reduce wave reflection from the boundary. The domain is 
discretized by a uniform spacing = /100x L , and the time step can be obtained from 
Courant number equal to 0.5. 
 As shown in 
 to Fig. 5-5, the wave set-up increases with increasing wave nonlinearity for given 
conditions. Moreover, the skewness of wave profile becomes distinct as the wave 
nonlinearity increases. These phenomena are also conformed by the findings of 
Nielsen (1990), and Cartwright et al. (2003). More details about the mechanics of 
energy transformation can be revealed via an amplitude spectrum analysis. While the 
magnitude of all of the harmonics except the zeroth harmonic (DC term) decays with

sponge layer placed in the downward end of the tank, and the horizontal spacing 
= /150x L . 
 The topography and the computed results are given in Fig. 5-7. It is noted that 
the waves do not break in these case 3(a) to 3(c). As seen in Fig. 5-7, the shape of 
waves become skewed as water waves with a small damping rate ( =ik  0.049) start to 
propagate up the slope bottom due to a nonlinear effect. The wave height is greatly 
increased until it reaches the crest of the trapezoid structure, suggesting that the 
shoaling effect outweighs the damping effect caused by the porous resistance force. 
As water waves reach the crown, =x  12.5 m, of the trapezoidal structure in the 
porous media, the appreciable discrepancies between fully nonlinear and weakly 
nonlinear model are observed. In particular, the noticeable discrepancies are found in 
both phase speed and wave amplitude after waves pass the crest due to both the 
de-shoaling effect and the porous damping. The spectra also indicate the energy was 
transformed into higher frequency components during the course of propagation from 
toe to top of the impermeable trapezoidal structure. Especially, the amplitudes of third 
and forth harmonics are observed to be even larger than that of second harmonic as 
waves propagate on the crown of the impermeable trapezoid structure. Note that the 
waves still experience the porous damping at the same time. More details about 
energy transformation will be discussed below.

 Although this case is somewhat artificial, it demonstrates the importance of wave 
nonlinearity and the fully nonlinear model may be needed as wave-structure 
interaction becomes important.

porous media, the nonlinear drag coefficient pb  is set to be 0 and 2.16 with the same 
wave conditions. The numerical setup is the same as that used in case 2 except the 
wave height =wH  4.0 cm giving the larger wave nonlinearity. 
 As seen in Fig. 5-9, the thin/red line represents the results of fully nonlinear 
model with =pb  0 and the coarse/grey line designates the results of fully nonlinear 
model with =pb  2.16. Clearly, the damping rate of the wave amplitude for these two 
conditions are quite different. With nonlinear damping taken into account, the wave 
amplitude decays faster.

Chapter 1 Introduction 
1.1  Dam-Break Wave 
 The behavior of dam-break wave propagating along the bottom is a fundamental 
and an important issue for fluid mechanics and engineering applications since 1890s 
(Ritter, 1892; Stoker, 1957). Theoretically, Ritter (1892) pioneeringly derived an 
analytical solution based on nonlinear shallow water equations to describe dam-break 
wave propagating over a dry water bed. Later, the analytical solution was extended by 
Stoker (1957) to investigate dam-break wave moving over a wet water bed which the 
depth was not zero initially. 
 Experimentally, Martin and Moyce (1952) provided a series of experiments to 
study dam-break wave propagating along dry bed. Several different ratios of the 
height to length and different kinds of shape of impoundment water (water column) 
are considered. Two time histories including the advance of bore front and the surface 
displacement moved downwards near the beginning wall were mainly measured. The 
evolutions of dam-break wave moving over the wet bed were conducted by Stansby et 
al. (1998). The significant physical phenomena such as the mushroom-jet and 
backward breaking wave were observed when the dam-break wave propagates over a 
wet bed. Recently, Jánosi et al. (2004) performed a set of experiments to investigate 
the dam-break wave motion with different density fluids. Moreover, the effect of gate 
motion was experimentally considered by Shigemastu et al. (2004) in which the exact 
displacement of gate motion was extracted from digital images. They concluded that 
the effect of gate motion may play a significant role in studying the dam-break wave 
problem. 
 Unlike the dam-break wave moving along the dry bed, the problem became 
much complex because of the effects of wave breaking and turbulence attributed to 
the dam-break wave pressed a wet bed. However, important information such as the 
velocity field and the distribution of vorticity was rare to be obtained experimentally. 
To complete our knowledge of the dam-break motions, one of the alternatives is to 
employ the numerical model. Numerically, the numerical models (Monaghan, 1994; 
Shao and Lo, 2003; Shigematsu et al., 2004) were widely validated with the 
experimental data of dam-break wave moving along the dry bed (1952). Shigemastu 
et al. (2004) provided numerical results by considering a gate motion. A very good 
agreement can be observed from the comparison between numerical results and its 
experimental data. However, the interaction of moving obstacle and water body did 
not be considered at all. Recently, Crespo et al. (2008) published a series of numerical 
simulations to study the mixing process between the impoundment and the wet bed. 
The interaction of moving obstacle and water body can be solved by the smoothed 
particle hydrodynamics (SPH), by which more details of dynamic of dam-break wave 
48 
 
be predicted by the Reynolds stresses which are embedded in the momentum equation. 
The ensemble-averaged is in practice often associated with a temporal averaged 
operator (Pedras and de Lemos, 2001; Hsu et al., 2002). However, the Reynolds 
stresses are not easy to compute. Furthermore, the RANS equations cannot be closed 
due to the presence of unknown Reynolds stresses. Therefore, several turbulence 
models were developed to model the turbulence effects and close the RANS equations. 
One of these methods is k   turbulence model (Harlow and Nakayama, 1968; 
Lemos, 1992). Lemos (1992) first published a turbulence model to close the RANS 
equations and the Reynolds stresses were modeled by solving a set of balance 
equations which was composed of turbulence kinetic energy equation ( k  equation) 
and turbulence dissipation rate equation (  equation). This model is called k   
turbulence model which was widely used to study hydrodynamic problem.  Later, 
Lin and Liu (1998; 1998a; 1998b) developed a Navier-Stokes model embedding 
k   turbulence model called Cobras (Cornell Breaking Wave and Structure model). 
Cobras was modified from the model "Ripple" which is a two-dimensional volume of 
fluid (VOF) model and was developed by the group T-3 at Los Alamos National 
Laboratory. Quantitative information such as wave breaking process in the surf zone 
was investigated by employing this turbulence model. Recently, Wu and Liu (2004) 
proposed a three-dimensional VOF numerical model embedding the k   
turbulence model. This model was modified from the Truchas which also developed 
by group T-3 at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The complex flow field in a 
three-dimensional domain can be thus studied with this powerful three-dimensional 
model. The plentiful information was obtained from k   turbulence model. 
However, the results gained from k   turbulence model will be less accurate and 
reasonable under high Reynolds number flow because k   turbulence model uses 
the same formula to model the all scale of eddies in the computational domain.  
 To overcome the above-mentioned problem, a spatial average method called 
large eddy simulation (LES) was developed (Smagorinsky, 1963; Deardorff, 1970; 
Schumann, 1975; Cabot and Moin, 2000; Bussmann et al., 2002; Wu, 2004; Liu et al., 
2005; Maruyama, 2008). Unlike RANS equations, LES tried to explicitly solve the 
main large eddies motion from the spatial filtered Navier-Stokes equations and model 
the small eddies by the turbulence model. Theoretically, LES is between the DNS and 
RANS in the terms of computational time and the accuracy of simulations. Although 
the more computational time will be taken, LES presents the more accurate and 
reliable results in high Reynolds number flow. Therefore, LES is chosen to study the 
turbulence motions in this study.

Formula 
 
2.1 Dam-Break Wave 
 The mechanics of dam-break wave propagation is a vital issue about human life 
and engineering applications since 1890s. Since then, substantial results have been 
obtained by many researchers. With the advancement of computational techniques 
and resources, more detailed hydrodynamics of dam-break waves can be revealed by 
revisiting this classical problem.  
 The classical dam-break wave theories were developed by Ritter (1892) who is 
pioneeringly found the analytical solution for describing the dam-break wave 
propagation along a dry bed and Stoker (1957) who first extended Ritter's theory to 
the wet bed case. In the following, the classical and simplest dam-break theory will be 
briefly introduced. 
2.1.1 Dam-Break Wave Moving along a Dry Bed 
 Ritter's (1892) analytical solution was derived based on long wave theory. In his 
theory, the flow motion is two-dimensional and the impoundment is blocked by an 
imaginary gate which is removed instantaneously when the dam is broken. In an 
infinite domain with a flat bottom topography, such a two-dimensional dam-break 
wave motion can be described by, 
  txu h       (2.1) 
t x xu uu g    (2.2) 
where x  is downstream direction and t  is time. The bottom is at  z h x  , 
 ,x t   the surface elevation and h  the total water depth. For the surface 
elevation  , it will never be touched the bottom, i.e.,  t h   .  , ,u u x z t  is 
the velocity, and g  is the gravity acceleration. Basically, Eq. (2.1) equation of 
continuity and Eq. (2.2) is momentum equation. The propagation speed  ,c x t  in 
the shallow water is defined as  g h  .  
Reformulating these two governing equations, we can readily obtain, 
 2 0t x x xu uu cc gh     (2.3) 
2 2 0t x xc uc cu    (2.4)

Fig. 2-1 The sketch of dam-break wave with a dry bed condition 
 
 As shown in Fig. 2-1, the analytical solution (Eq. (2.11)) indicates that 
dam-break wave has two characteristics line of wave front: the wave front propagated 
forward along downstream with the speed equal to double of C ; another one is 
propagated backward upstream with the speed C . In terms of Froude number ( rF ) 
which defined as u C , the speed of wave front has two states: supercritical flow and 
critical flow for dam-break wave propagating forward and backward, respectively. 
Also, it is quite easy to find two constant quantities at 0x  : (1) the depth is always 
kept the value 4 9h ; and (2) the velocity remains the value 2 3C  (Ritter, 1892; 
Stoker, 1957).  
 
2.1.2 Dam-break Wave Propagating over a Wet Bed 
 The situation of section 2.1.1 is an ideal treatment. In fact, the downstream water 
depth behind the dam-site is normally nonzero. For example, the ambient depth 
caused by leakage from the impoundment could be 1~3 mm in the dry-bed 
experiments (Stansby, 1998). Therefore, the analytical solution of wet-bed case is 
quite necessary.  
 Next, a more general situation to describe the dam-break wave interacts with an 
ambient depth water will be considered. For the wet-bed case can be treated as

 To find 
ah  we can solve Eq. (2.22) iteratively. After doing the analyses of shock 
above, we connect the shock condition and dam-break wave as follows.  
As shown in Fig. 2-3, to describe the dam-break wave propagates over a wet bed, the 
channel can be separated into fore zone. The zone 0 to zone 3 are impoundment,

Chapter 3 Mathematical Equations and Boundary Conditions  
In this study, Navier-Stokes equations which are the most complete equations for 
hydrodynamic problems are chosen to study dam-break wave problems. To discuss 
the effect on the dam-break behavior caused by gate motion, the source function will 
incorporate into the Navier-Stokes equations. In addition, to simulate the dam-break 
wave interacting with the porous media, the employment of proper turbulence model 
and the resistance force formula are necessary. 
This chapter will organize as follows. The governing equations used to 
investigate the dam-break wave problems are presented in section 3.1. Then, the 
turbulence model is necessary to describe the turbulent flow field when velocity 
becomes larger. Therefore, the turbulence model called large eddy simulation (LES) 
will be discussed at section 3.2. To close the LES model in the porous media, the 
semi-empirical resistance force which can be obtained from a macroscopic 
spatial-averaged concept (Sollitt and Cross, 1972; van Gent, 1991; van Gent, 1995) 
will be introduced at section 3.3. By doing so, the filtered governing equations 
embedding the resistance force can be derived. The proper boundary conditions (BC) 
including initial BC, Dirichlet type BC, and Neumann type BC will be briefly 
presented in Section 3.4. 
3.1 Spatially averaged Navier-Stokes equations 
 The Navier-Stokes equations embedded the source function for incompressible 
flow are given as:

in which u  the velocity vector of the fluid,   the density, P  the pressure, and g  
the gravity acceleration vector. The viscous stress tensor can be expressed as 
 , ,ij i j j iu u    in which   is dynamic viscosity. The operator  = , ,x y z    in 
which  , ,x y zx  is position vector 
When a fluid particle flows in the porous media, it experiences the resistance 
force caused by the skeleton. Such resistance forces can be macroscopically described 
by several resistance force formulas. Therefore, to combine the momentum equation 
Eq. (3.12) with the proper macroscopic resistance force formula, the governing 
equations from macroscopic point of view is first desired. 
As shown in Fig. 3-1, a representative elementary volume (REV) with volume 
V  in the porous media is composed of one kind of incompressible fluid, solid and air. 
The corresponding volumes occupied by each phase in the REV are 
wV , sV  and aV , 
respectively. The total volume of a REV can be expressed as,

respectively. 
fS
n  is the unity vector normal to fS . Note that 0fS u  if the solid is 
assumed to be fixed. We also remark that the last term of right hand side (RHS) of Eq. 
(3.7) to Eq. (3.9) will vanish due to the absence of solid or the interfacial surface fS . 
From Eq. (3.5) and Eq. (3.6), the mean property of   over V  can be evaluated by

The physical quantities with the averaged value over whole

thk  
REV is denoted by 
i

i
 , 
wf  are apparent velocity 
(Darcy velocity or superficial velocity), intrinsic velocity and porosity, respectively. 
With the aids of Eq. (3.5) to Eq. (3.9), we can readily obtain the macroscopic 
governing equations of the fluid in the 
thk  REV by taking the spatial average 
operator ( ) into the microscopic Navier-Stokes equations (Eq. (3.1) and Eq. (3.2)):

turbulence model is necessary to approximate. In this study, we choose the "large 
eddy simulation" (LES) as the adopted turbulence model. Next, the LES model will 
be presented. 
3.2 Turbulence model: large eddy simulation  
3.2.1 The kernel function 
In this report, LES employed a spatial filter to solve velocity field on a coarse 
grid. Leonard (1974) define a filtered variable as:  
     ,x x G x x dx       (3.13) 
in which G  is the kernel/filter function and   is an arbitrary variable. The notation 
' ' denotes the filtered variable. The concept of the filter is the main part of LES

where   is the kinematic viscosity which is defined as   .  
Mathematically, Eqs. (3.19) and (3.20) are still not closed, and should be further 
addressed. Therefore, the subgrid tensor 
r
ij  must be modeled to make the 
momentum equation as a closed system. The simple and natural way is to assume that 
the effect of turbulence can be represented by the enhanced viscosity. The most 
commonly used subgrid scale model is the Smagorinsky model (Smagorinsky, 1963). 
In the following section, the Smagorinsky model (1963) will briefly be introduced. 
3.2.3 The linear eddy viscosity model  
The Smagorinsky model (1963) is essentially a linear eddy viscosity model: 
2rij sgs ijS    (3.21) 
where the coefficient sgs  is the sub-grid scale eddy viscosity of the residual motions.

The eddy viscosity sgs  is modeled by the follows:

in which 
sl  is Smagorinsky length scale which is defined as  
2
sC  .   is filter 
width is usually taken to be third root of the volume of the cell. For the isotropic 
turbulence under the three-dimensional flow problems, the Smagorinsky coefficient is 
near to 0.2. However, 
sC  is not a constant. Based on the dimensional analysis, its 
value varies from 0.1 to 0.2 in different three-dimensional flows. S  is the 
characteristic filtered rate of strain and is defined as, 
1/2
2 ij ijS S S     (3.24) 
The effective viscosity is calculated from:

Thus, the momentum equation can be rewritten as:

in which   is porosity of porous media,   the kinematic viscosity, 50d  the median 
diameter and   the non-dimensional empirical coefficient which is not a constant 
and depends on the characteristics of porous media and problems.   is a 
non-dimensional coefficient and   is a non-dimensional coefficient. The values of 
the empirical coefficients,  ,   and   depend on the characteristics of porous 
layer and problems to be solved (Losada et al., 2008).

Note the operator R  will vanish when Eq. (3.28) is used to describe the 
hydrodynamic problem under the clear water ( 1  ). We remark here that the 
parameters of porous media used in Eq. (3.33) are all scalars. However, we can 
readily extend the scalar to the vectors and more general problems such as the 
anisotropic porous media can be considered. 
By using LES model, we can solve the main physical phenomenon with the coarser 
grid than DNS. However, near the solid boundary the flow may not be fully resolved 
by LES. In the following section, we will point the problem out and improve it by 
employing the wall function. 
3.4 The initial condition and boundary condition 
The governing equations will not obtain the correct solutions unless the proper 
boundary conditions and initial condition are applied. Which boundary condition 
should be employed? This problem greatly depends on the real physics. The 
applicable initial and boundary conditions should be used by different flow and 
conditions.  
The mathematical boundaries of problem in this study are shown in Fig. 3-2. The 
problem domain which is bounded by  . The solid body is denoted by a netted mesh

introductions are given as follows: 
Dirichlet (or first-type) boundary condition: when imposed on an ordinary or a 
partial differential equation, it specifies the values a solution needs to take on the 
boundary of the domain. Also, the question of finding solutions to such equations is 
known as the Dirichlet problem. 
Neumann (or second-type) boundary condition: when imposed on an ordinary or 
a partial differential equation, it specifies the values that the derivative of a solution is 
to take on the boundary of the domain. 
In the following sections, the boundary conditions and initial condition used in this 
study will be presented and divided.

Theoretically, we can readily obtain a set of trivial solution: 
0 0 00 ; ;iu P gz F h     (3.43) 
in which h  is the still water level and 0P  is hydrostatic pressure. In other words, 
Eq. (3.43) denotes the situation of a empty wave tank and that is the most commonly 
used values as the initial condition. Generally, the initial velocity 
0
iu  and 
0F  can be 
specified by laboratory data or analytical solutions. However, for all the cases 
presented in this study, the initial flow conditions are specified with Eq. (3.43). 
3.4.2 Dirichlet type boundary conditions 
3.4.2.1 The stationary no-slip wall boundary condition 
For the no-slip boundary condition,

  in Fig. 3-2, the relative normal and 
tangential velocity of fluid with respect to the solid face should be zero. In other

3.4.3 Neumann type boundary conditions 
3.4.3.1 The free-slip boundary condition 
An alternative way to set the boundary condition on the solid face is free-slip 
boundary condition instead of no-slip wall boundary condition. By neglecting the 
shear stress effect, no tangential shear stress will be generated on the wall. The 
situation does not like real physical phenomenon which existed a strong gradient of 
velocity and other dependent variables. By doing so, the coarse resolution may have a 
chance to compute the correct results except the boundary layer near the solid face. 
70 
 
effects are of equal importance. The Fig. 4-1 shows these subdivisions of the near 
wall region. 
 
Fig. 4-1 The turbulent boundary layer (Copy from FLUENT manual.) 
Mathematically and numerically, it is assumed that the logarithmic profile 
reasonably approximates the velocity distribution near the wall. The logarithmic 
nature gives rise to the well-known "log law of the wall". 
Like other turbulence model, LES model is limited to resolve the local turbulent eddy 
caused by the viscous scales in the sublayer region of near the solid face when 
Reynolds number becomes large. Therefore, a wall function approach which reduced 
the number of computational cells proposed by Cabot and Moin (2000) is adopted in 
this study. A set of near wall damping functions is used to approximate the eddy 
viscosity. They are:

displacement. Oppositely, the fluid and momentum flux will be sucked into the wake 
zone of the solid body. Therefore, the extra source of mass and momentum flux which 
yielded from the process of moving solid should be considered in the Navier-Stokes 
equations. 
Such a theory is documentarily called moving solid algorithm (MSA) which 
firstly published by Heinrich (1992). He added a source function in the continuity 
equation to simulate two-dimensional landslide problems. Recently, Liu et al. (2005) 
and Wu (2004) provided a modified and more accurate version of MSA to make sure 
that the effective cell volume can be exactly preserved. In this study, the modified 
version of MSA provided by Wu (2004) is adopted. The brief concept will be 
presented as follows. 
Considering a solid obstacle which the volume is 
obsV  inside a cell. The

expressed as:

If the obstacle volume increases which also implies the obstacle is come into the 
volume and fluid is squeezed out of the cell volume V . Therefore, the continuity

where   of Eq. (3.1) is an internal source function. As mentioned above, not only 
the mass but also the momentum flux shall be pushed by the obstacle. Also, the 
momentum equation Eq. (3.2) should be modified. Similarly, the momentum equation 
(Eq. (3.2)) reads,

In the computations, the source function which changed with time in Eq. (4.6) 
will then be applied to PPE to calculate the new-time pressure and velocity as the first 
step. As the second step, we update the VOF for the solid part to finish the whole 
moving solid processes. The only information that we need to know is the solid VOF 
at each time step in this moving solid algorithm. 
4.5 Grid convergence test 
In order to obtain a convergent solution for all the numerical simulations carried 
out in this paper, the mesh convergence tests are necessary. Although we perform the 
convergence tests for all the cases in this study, we shall give the most complex 
simulation as an example to demonstrate the appropriate choice of meshes.

performed in a closed numerical tank which is 4.5 m long0.1 m wide0.15 m high. 
The grid of 1800160 is applied to the computational domain. Except the top side 
which is treated as the zero pressure boundary condition (see section 3.4.2), the 
numerical tank is surrounded by the solid walls on which the free-slip boundary 
condition is applied. In addition, the LES turbulence model is employed to simulate 
the turbulent motion. 
Based on long wave theory introduced in section 2.1.1, there are two wave fronts 
generated after the dam was broken. One propagates forward along downstream with 
the speed 2 gh  in which h  is the impoundment depth and g  is gravity 
acceleration. The other wave front propagates backward (upstream) with the speed 
gh . For a purpose of conveniently describing these two wave fronts, we shall refer 
the wave front propagating forward downstream as "bore front" and the wave front 
moving backward upstream as "backward wave front", from now on. 
The non-dimensional numerical surface elevations are compared to Ritter's 
analytical solution (Eq. (2.11)) at several different stages. As shown in Fig. 5-1, the 
non-dimensional time (
*t ) is normalized by h g  and the location x  and surface 
elevation   are normalized by h . In terms of the surface elevation, the discrepancy 
between Ritter's analytical solution and numerical surface elevation is visible at early 
stage (
* 5t  ). In more detail, the bore front profile of computational results moves 
slower than the Ritter's analytical solution (see Fig. 5-1-(a) ). It implies that the 
dimensional speed of the bore front is smaller than the double of gh  during the 
early stage. For the backward wave front, the wave front moves much faster than the 
Ritter's analytical solution. In other words, the backward wave front moves faster than 
gh  that predicted by Ritter (1892).  
As time progresses, the bore front increases its speed to reach about 2 gh  and 
backward wave front decreases its speed to match the speed gh . The differences of 
surface elevation between computational and analytical solution become quite 
indiscernible. Particularly, the water depth at 0x h   of the computational results 
agrees Ritter's theory (1892) well at 0x h   (see Eq. (2.11)). 
In addition, we trace the location of bore front and backward wave front to know 
how the wave fronts velocities evolve. The information including horizontal velocity, 
vertical velocity, and front location are recorded as time functions. Moreover, the 
surface elevation at the upstream wall is also recorded to know when the backward 
touches the wall. The wave fronts information is demonstrated in Fig. 5-2. Particularly, 
the horizontal velocity of bore front will grow up to 2u gh   (the relative error 
threshold is 
21.0 10 ) about * 3t   as shown in Fig. 5-2(d). Therefore, a criterion 
might be chosen as 
* 3t   to judge that when the computational bore front velocity 
matches with the analytical solution. 
78 
 
computational surface elevation (see the wave front above the analytical curve) does 
not exhibit a hydrostatic pressure distribution.  
As time progresses (
* 5t  ), the pressure distribution under the surface elevation 
agrees with the hydrostatic pressure assumption. Conclusively, the visible differences 
between computational results and analytical solution are caused by the incorrect long 
wave assumption including the small order of vertical velocity and hydrostatic 
pressure distribution during the early stage (
* 5t  ) of the dam-break wave process. 
We remark here that these findings are also confirmed with Shigematsu et al. (2004).  
Additionally, the non-dimensional lateral vorticity defined as 2 h g   in 
which 
2 1,3 3,1u u    is illustrated in Fig. 5-6. It is noted that the direction of positive 
lateral vorticity is pointed into the paper and the direction of negative lateral vorticity 
is pointed out the paper. As seen in Fig. 5-6, during the early stage, e.g., 
* 2t  , the 
positive lateral vorticity is focused on the area above the analytical curve that is 
identical to the region which exists strong vertical velocity as we mentioned earlier. 
Similar to the evolution of strong vertical velocity, both the positive and negative 
lateral vorticity become smaller as time progresses. Conclusively, quite small amount 
of lateral vorticity is generated by dam-break wave process with a dry bed condition.

fronts velocity and lateral vorticity distribution caused by different boundary 
conditions including the effects of free-slip/no-slip wall boundary, end boundary, and 
moving boundary (gate motion) are examined. 
5.2.1 The End Wall Boundary Effects 
For a purpose to find out the solution of ordinary differential equation based on 
long wave theory (e.g., Eq. (2.5)), the length of dam-break wave domain are assumed 
to be infinite. For this reason, the analytical solution will fail when wave fronts touch 
the wall. However, the real situation of dam-break wave is probably closer to 
semi-infinite domain. In other words, the length of impoundment is finite and the 
length along downstream can be assumed to be infinite. Therefore, we shall 
investigate the end boundary effects on the evolution of dam-break wave next.  
Here, two case sets, Case 1 and Case 2, will be employed to study the effect of 
the end boundary condition. Case 1 applies the free-slip boundary condition on the 
surrounded solid walls and bottom wall. For Case 2, the no-slip boundary condition is 
applied on the upstream, downstream and bottom boundaries. On spanwise side walls, 
the free-slip boundary conditions arecondition is employed to ensure the 
two-dimensional wave motion. 
To investigate effects of the end boundary, three sizes of impoundment are used 
for Case 1 and Case 2: (a) 0.5m0.1m0.1m; (b) 1.0m0.1m0.1m; and (c) 
1.5m0.1m0.1m. The numerical experiments are performed in a closed numerical 
tank which is 4.5 m long0.1 m wide0.15 m high. The grids applied to the 
computational domain are 1400160, 1600160, and 1800160 for Case 1,2 
(a~c), respectively. In addition, the zero pressure boundary condition is applied on the 
top side and the LES turbulence model is implemented to solve the large eddies and 
model the small eddies in these six cases. The Smagorinsky coefficient is set to 0.3. 
The parameters of these two case sets are summarized in Tab. 5-1. 
As mentioned earlier, the bore front and backward wave front would propagate 
forward and backward when the dam was broken. After the backward wave front 
touches the wall, the surface elevation will be dropped down gradually (see 
5x h   , 10  and 15  for Case 1(a), Case 1(b) and Case 1(c), respectively) and 
backward wave front will then be reflected by the wall. Such a phenomenon is treated 
as a water column collapse problem (Martin and Moyce, 1952). The comparisons 
between numerical results of Case 1(a-c) and the analytical solution (Ritter, 1892) are 
given in Fig. 5-8. As shown in Fig. 5-8, the analytical solution (Ritter, 1892) fails to 
predict backward wave front when the backward wave front touches the wall at 
upstream. Specifically, a visible discrepancy between the analytical solution (black 
88 
 
presence of end boundary will greatly decrease the total water depth at 0x h  . 
The corresponding results of Case 2(a~c) are given in Fig. 5-11, Fig. 5-12 and 
Fig. 5-13, respectively. The non-dimensional speed of Case 2(a) (aquamarine line), 
Case 2(b) (gold line) and Case 2(c) (yellow line) are about 1.238, 1.2123 and 1.121, 
respectively. The non-dimensional speed of bore front is 1.043.  
According to the bore front speeds and reflected wave speeds of Case 1 and Case 
2, we can readily find that the speed of bore front and reflected wave will be 
influenced by the viscous effect (i.e. no-slip boundary condition). Particularly, the 
speed of bore front decreases to about gh . This means that the reflected wave will 
catch up the bore front as long as the propagating time is large enough.  
From Fig. 5-13, an interesting finding can be found in Fig. 5-13 by comparing 
with Fig. 5-10 and Fig. 5-13 that the surface elevations of Case 2(a~e) lift up about 
0.0176z h   (about 1.76 mm). The shift depth may be due to the viscous effect.

5.2.2 The Effects of Gate Motion 
The effects caused by gate motion on the dam-break wave moving along a dry 
bed are investigated in this section. The numerical results are first compared with the 
experimental data published by Shigemastu et al. (2004) to validate and demonstrate 
the ability in the function of moving solid algorithm (MSA). Then, five different gate 
motions are also incorporated in the discussion. Particularly, one of them is the 
pull-down motion which is one of possible causes to the dam break failure. 
The numerical validation is made by comparing the dam-break wave along a dry 
bed with the experimental data published by Shigemastu et al. (2004). The experiment 
was performed in a tank, 0.9 m long0.295 m wide0.425 m high, at Cornell 
University. The gate made by 5mm thickness acrylic plate was placed behind the 
impoundment. During the experiment, the gate was manually opened within 0.1 sec to 
generate dam-break waves. Meanwhile, a still camera was used to take digital images 
at every 1/60 s. The measured displacement function of the gate was then accurately 
extracted from digital images. The upward and uniform accelerated motion of gate 
reads, 
96 
 
speed=1.5 m/s; (c) pull-up with a uniform acceleration as Eq. (5.1); (d) pull-down as a 
constant speed=1.5 m/s; and (e) pull-down with a uniform acceleration as Eq. (5.1). 
As shown in Fig. 5-15, the comparisons between the five numerical results and 
experimental data of Shigemastu et al. (2004) with different dimensionless time stages, 
t t g h   ( h  is the depth of impoundment water), are illustrated.  
The similar results of Shigemastu et al. (2004) are reproduced by comparing the 
results of Case 4(a) and (c) with the experimental data. As the conclusion made by 
Shigematsu et al. (2004), the result of the gate movement with Case 4(c) greatly 
improves the accuracy in the surface displacement and certainly emphasizes the 
importance of the gate motion. We remarks here, the numerical result of "gradual 
case" of Shigematsu et al. (2004) did not really use the moving solid algorithm which 
includes the interaction of the dam-break wave and moving gate. Although we did not 
show their results, our model seems to better capture the evolution of dam-break wave 
as can be seen that an excellent agreement is observed from Fig. 5-15.

Moreover, the different types of gate motion are also numerically investigated. In 
the Case 4(b) and Case 4(c), the surface elevation near the bore front of Case 4(b) is 
farther than that of Case 4(c), because the initial velocity of gate in Case 4(b) is 
greater than that of Case 4(c). Later, the velocity of the gate in Case 4(c) will be 
greater than that of Case 4(b), since the velocity of gate in Case (c) is increased as 
increasing of time. Therefore, the surface elevation close to the impoundment of Case 
4(c) is farther than that of Case 4(b). 
When the gate motion is pull-down (Case 4(d) and Case 4(e)), the water volume 
initially released by Case 4(d) is more than that in Case 4(e) and a stronger vorticity 
motion and a longer time delay of the bore front are yielded by Case 4(d) than by 
Case 4(e). More significantly, the gate motions of the Case 4(d) and Case 4(e) 
represent one of possible means to dam failure. However, pull-down of gate motion is

However, the shock wave theory cannot describe the flow fields where strong 
horizontal vorticity exists such as the wave breaking, the hydraulic jump and the 
mushroom jet. Again, numerical model especially the Navier-Stokes model can play 
an important role to investigate these phenomena.  
In this section, we will verify present numerical model by comparing 
computational results with experimental data (Jánosi, 2004). The experiment was 
performed in a channel which is 9.55 m long, 0.15 m wide and over than 0.15 m high 
(the high did not be told in Jánosi, 2004). The bottom and surrounding walls of the 
channel were made of glass. The experiments were recorded by two CCD cameras 
including a fixed fast-shutter camera (Sensicam, PCO Imaging) which can be 
provided the side or plan views and a small portable camcorder (Sony DCRPC115E) 
which was fixed on a trolley to follow the bore front. The exact bore front position 
was extracted from digitalized pictures. 
In this study, the experimental data used to compare with computational results 
was digitized from the digital image of the case that the ambient fluid depth equal to 
18 mm (Fig.2(b) in Jánosi, 2004). 
To verify present numerical model against the experimental data, the 
two-dimensional dam-break is simulated in a closed numerical tank which is 5.0 m 
long  0.1 m wide  0.2 m high. The grid of 4000  1  160 is applied to the 
computational domain. Free-slip and zero pressure boundary conditions are used on 
the surrounded wall/bottom and top side, respectively. Particularly, the LES 
turbulence model is necessary to simulate the strong vorticity and mixing process. To 
illustrate the wet bed (ambient layer water) pushed by the impoundment, we specify 
different VOF number to them. By doing so, we can distinguish the impoundment 
(blue line) from ambient water (black line). For example, as seen in Fig. 5-16, the 
impoundment and ambient water are denoted as blue contour line and black contour 
line, respectively. Also, we can clearly observe how the impoundment pushes the 
ambient water or the mixing process.  
Initially, there is a interface, a discontinuous condition (Stoker, 1957), between 
impoundment and ambient water. After dam is broken, two wave breakings are soon 
generated via the impoundment pushing the ambient water. One breaking wave 
propagates backward along the upstream first and then other moves along the opposite 
direction. Particularly, this two breaking wave identical to the mushroom unstable 
configuration forms that first reported by Stansby et al. (1998). During the wave 
breaking process, part of air will be trapped in the water. At the same time, the wave 
breaking will bring more the turbulent mixing near the bore front (Jánosi, 2004). The 
presence of forward breaking wave which its kinetic energy is usually large enough to 
yield successive wave breakings (Stoker, 1957; Jánosi, 2004; Crespo et al., 2008).

turbulent energy. 
In next section, we will numerically study the effect on the surface elevation, 
wave fronts velocity and lateral vorticity distribution under different ratio of ambient 
water depth to impoundment depth and different gate motions.

the computational cannot obtain the concentration mixing or dispersion near the 
interface. 
Clearly, unlike dam-break wave with a dry bed condition which the wave 
behavior is independent on the depth of impoundment, the wave behavior of 
dam-break wave with a wet bed condition strongly depends on the ratio r  of the 
impoundment depth h  to the ambient water depth d .  
Roughly, at least three main features can be captured through the present five 
cases as seen in Fig. 5-18. All the impoundments push and lift the ambient waters. A 
visible backward wave motion (backward water collapsing) can be observed near the 
interface between both fluids, says the impoundment and the ambient water. We 
remark here that we prefer not to call the backward motion as a breaking wave due to 
its intrinsic nature is quite different from the wave breaking in ocean according to the 
later analyses. Last, the negative (counterclockwise) lateral vorticity can be observed 
rear of the interface between both fluids. 
For more detail, an obvious and the early stage of mushroom-like jet can be 
found in Fig. 5-18(a-1) and Fig. 5-18(b-1, c-1 and d-1). The mushroom-like jet has the 
following wave motion pattern: (1) forward wave breaking is farther (right of) from 
the interface of two fluids; and (2) backward water collapsing rear (left of) the 
interface of two fluids. The positive and negative slopes of interface of two fluids can 
be respectively found in Fig. 5-18(a-3, b-3) and Fig. 5-18(c-3, d-3 and e-3). For the 
intensity of lateral vorticity, the intensity of positive lateral vorticity decreases with 
the increase of the ratio r  of the impoundment depth h  to the ambient water depth 
d . And, the intensity of negative lateral vorticity increases with the decrease of r . 
Besides, the number of successive forward wave breaking decreases with increase of 
r . In fact, due to both larger potential energy of impoundment and less water to be 
pushed for smaller r , the ambient water has larger velocity leading to stronger 
forward breaking. Particularly, while no forward breaking occurs when 0.52r  , the 
successive forward breaking waves can be observed when 0.387r  . Moreover, a 
solitary-like wave can be observed under this ambient water depth ( 0.52r  ). We 
remark here that the presence of the solitary-like wave is also confirmed with Jánosi 
(2004), and Crespo et al. (2008). The lateral vorticity focuses on the forward breaking 
waves, backward water collapsing, trapped air bubbles and the rear of the interface of 
two fluids. In addition, a visible lateral vorticity pair can be identified near the bottom 
as seen in Fig. 5-18(e-1). 
Basically, the mechanism of dam-break wave impacting an ambient water is due 
to the impoundment pushes and lifts the ambient waters. The momentum forced on 
the ambient water given by impoundment with small value of r  is easier than that 
with large value of r . For this reason, a strong momentum exchange and lateral 
108 
 
forward component of velocity at the upper region is smaller than the lower region. 
Finally, the backward wave collapsing will hit the surface elevation of the 
impoundment. On the other hand, the upper fluid particles velocity of the right side of 
the protruded water will be continuously received the momentum from impoundment 
jet and tended to yield a wave breaking phenomenon because the velocity is greater 
than its limit as seen in Fig. 5-19(f). We remark here that the configuration form of 
Fig. 5-19(f) is indicated as a mushroom-like jet in this paper. In other words, we 
indicate the mushroom-like jet when the slope of the right side of protruded water 
tends to be positive. As time passes, the forward breaking wave will impinge the 
ambient water at 
* 2.427t  . 
The pressure contour and lateral vorticity are also given in Fig. 5-20 and Fig. 
5-21, respectively. As shown in 5-22, the pressure is slightly affected by the presence 
of mushroom-like jet. From the distribution of lateral vorticity, it reveals that the 
lateral vorticity is generated by gate motion, wave collapsing backward and wave 
breaking forward. The positive lateral vorticities are mainly distributed on the right 
side of breaking wave whereas the negative lateral vorticities are presented on the 
interface and wave collapsing backward. Note that the negative lateral vorticity are 
caused by the small forward velocity and larger forward velocity on the upper and 
lower fluid particles of the protruded water, respectively.

depth is much small, the breaking water in ambient water region will strongly effect 
by different gate motions. On other hand, the surface elevation and interface will be 
heavily influenced by the different gate motions when the ambient water depth is 
large.

(1999). As seen in Fig. 6-1, the discrepancies are found between the results of Case 
7(a~c) and experimental data. The results show that Case 7(b~c), which the 
discrepancies are barely visible between both. To compare Case 7(a) with Case 7(b~c), 
we found that the computational results are improved on the accuracy by specifying 
the gate motion. As expected, the comparisons are not surprising because the 
dam-break wave with the gate motion moving upwards gradually (Case 7(b~c)) are 
more close to the situation when performing the experiments. For Case 7(d) to Case 
7(e), when the gate moves downward with the constant speed (1.5 m/s) and a uniform 
acceleration (Eq. (5.1)), a non-dimensional delay is observed in the time history about 
0.578 (0.09 sec). However, the time histories of these two curves (Case 7(d~e)) are 
similar to the experimental data. 
To understand more information about the discrepancies between dam-break 
wave with different types of the gate motions, Fig. 6-2 and Fig. 6-3 show the contour 
plots of the surface profiles and the distribution of the lateral vorticities of Case 7(b) 
and Case 7(d), respectively. Four non-dimensional subplots are shown with the first 
three snapshots being the transient status at early stages and the last being the image 
of later stage. In each subplot, the gate is filled with black color (see the first subplot 
of Fig. 6-2 and Fig. 6-3) and the rectangle porous structure is marked between two 
grey coarse vertical lines. The contour plot is plotted by the normalized vorticity 
which defined as 
2 /h g   in which 2 1,3 3,1u u   .

stage. 
 
122 
 
As shown in Fig. 6-2, the water volume is released as a jet flow due to the gate 
moves upwards. It is noted that the direction of positive lateral vorticity is pointed 
into the paper. Oppositely, the flow similar to wave breaking is observed when the 
gate moved downwards as seen in Fig. 6-3. As the dam-break wave propagates further, 
the vorticity fields of these two cases are almost the same as shown in both the last 
snapshot of Fig. 6-2 and Fig. 6-3. Again, the different gate motion yields different 
time delay. However, the final profiles of the surface elevation of Case 7(a) to Case 
7(e) are similar. 
More significantly, the effect of porous media may be recognized by comparing 
Cases 7(d-e) and Cases 4(d-e) of section 5.2.2. In Cases 4(d-e), the different 
tendencies of surface elevation evolution can be observed in the third and fourth 
subplots of Fig. 5-15. Unexpectedly, the tendencies of surface elevation evolution of 
Cases 7(d-e) are quite similar. To explain this contradiction, we also check the time 
history of surface elevation at a short distance from the inlet of porous. Therefore, 
time histories of surface elevations of Cases 7(a-e) at the location of a quarter of 
length of porous structure ( 0.373x   m) are given in Fig. 6-4. Clearly, the tendencies 
of present Cases 7(d-e) as shown in Fig. 6-4 are quite similar too. The comparisons of 
the curve tendencies Fig. 6-1 and Fig. 6-4 give a reasonable indication as follows. The 
presence of resistance force due to porous media will result in the wave evolution of 
different gate motions reaching the steady state earlier since part of energy is damped 
by the resistance force. That is the reason why the wave released from different gate 
motion will quickly evolve to the similar surface profile.

impoundment, 0.4 m0.61 m0.3 m, was initially placed behind a thin gate. An 
impermeable square cylinder (0.12 m  0.12 m  0.75 m), was placed 0.5 m 
downstream of the gate and 0.24 m from the rear sidewall of the tank. During the 
experiments, about 1 cm depth of the leakage of water was presented in the 
downstream of the gate. Two time histories were measured. The net force on the 
cylinder was measured with a load cell. A Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) was 
used to record fluid velocity at a fixed location (0.754,0.0,0.026).  
In computations, the flow field of dam-break wave motion is turbulent flow 
because the order of Reynolds number is about  510O . For sake of saving 
computational time and symmetric experimental layout, eddies will be mainly 
generated at the corner of the structure. Therefore, the numerical simulation is applied 
with half of experimental tank and computed width to save the computational 
resources. The numerical tank is 1.6 m0.3 m0.75 m with uniform grid 1 cm in all 
directions. The Smagorinsky coefficient is set to 0.15 due to three-dimensional 
configuration of the problem (see Tab. 6-1). 
In this case, the free slip boundary condition is applied on the solid boundary. On 
the free surface, the zero pressure boundary condition is employed.

As shown in Fig. 6-8(a), the initial setup is shown as the dimensionless time (
*t ) 
equals zero. The bore will hit the wet bed and trap part of “air-bubbles” under it. At 
* 1.61t  , the bore impacts the square cylinder. At a later time, the main flow 
separates into two parts:(1) a jet-like fluid which impacts on the porous cylinder; (2) a 
pair of symmetric flows that is expected due to the computational results are 
generated by mirroring the half domain, passed around the square cylinder. To keep 
the integrity of physical phenomenon, we shall put the camera shot on part (1) and 
then move the camera target on part (2) next. 
After the jet-like fluid hits the square cylinder, it rapidly experiences an 
increased net force which reaches a peak about 30.3 N at 
* 1.72t  . As shown in Fig. 
6-8(d), the jet-like flow then starts to climb upward and at the same time a part of 
fluid is reflected from the porous cylinder and a part of it is transmitted to porous 
cylinder. The height of the jet-like flow reaches to the maximum as 0.75z h   at 
* 2.92t  . Later, the jet-like flow start to collapse and evolve gradually into the 
pouted-lower-lip-like flow (Fig. 6-8(e-h)). At 
* 4.41t  , the pouted-lower-lip-like 
water volume which trapped a ring-like region of air hits the floor as seen in Fig. 
6-8(g). 
From the second camera shot, the symmetric flows begin to merge into one flow 
due to the lower pressure (Wu, 2004) in the back of the porous cylinder as seen in Fig. 
6-8(d). At 
* 3.1t  , the released water collides with the downstream wall and the 
water reflected by the end wall hits the floor as seen in Fig. 6-8(h). The water will 
impact the rear side of the structure at 
* 7.3t   (see Fig. 6-8(i)). As shown in Fig. 
6-8(j), the wave will propagate further until hitting the upstream-side wall.

Fig. 6-8 (continued) 
 
132 
 
The porous cylinder is confined between two black dotted lines as seen in Fig. 
6-9. Inside the porous cylinder, the water table starts to ascend due to the transmission 
of dam-break wave after 
* 1.61t  . At * 3.39t  , the water table reaches the 
maximum of level as ~ 0.5z h . Similarly, due to the transmission of the water 
reflected by the downstream wall, the water table will ascend again inside the porous 
cylinder. During this process, the maximum of water level will reach ~ 0.5z h  as 
seen in Fig. 6-9(e). 
The influence on the net force time histories and the horizontal velocity time 
histories of porous media with different porosities   (0, 0.2 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 and 0.8) are 
depicted in Fig. 6-10 and Fig. 6-11. The smoothed net force time history, for 
comparison purpose, under different porosities is illustrated in Fig. 6-10. It is clearly 
observed that the positive net force peak decreases with the increasing porosity. As 
expected, the momentum reflected by cylinder will decrease due to the transmission 
of dam-break wave which will increase for larger porosity. The presence of the 
dam-break wave transmission will reduce the normal force about 70% for porosity 
being 0.8 and 20% for porosity being 20 %. Conclusively, the presence of porous 
media will greatly reduce the normal impact force.  
On the other hand, the negative net force peak (~1.5 sec) which is indicated as 
the impact on the rear side of cylinder by the reflected wave from back wall will 
decrease with the increase of porosity. The horizontal velocity time histories under 
different porosities are shown as Fig. 6-11. Before dam-break wave impacts the 
cylinder (i.e. before 0.31 sec), the differences between four time histories are barely 
visible. After that moment, the velocity departures from that of impermeable case 
increase as porosities increase. The bigger porosity means the larger effective 
discharge area and more water volume will be brought out. Therefore, the horizontal 
velocity will increase with increasing porosity.

Chapter 7 The Interaction of Three-Dimensional Partial Dam-Break Wave 
and Structure 
The discussions and studies in 錯誤! 找不到參照來源。 and Chapter 6 are 
focused on the full dam-break wave which is an ideal situation. The full dam-break 
wave will cause a huge disaster to human lives. Fortunately, this kind of dam-break 
failure is rarely happened. Actually, the most common dam-break events are of partial 
dam-break failure such as the St. Francis dam failure (1924) and the Delhi dam failure 
(2010) . Therefore, there is a need to investigate and study the dam-break wave due to 
partial dam failure further. Unlike full dam-break that the whole dam is gone, only a 
part of dam is broken for so-called partial dam-break. Therefore the type of 
dam-break wave is totally three-dimensional motion. 
In this chapter, the numerical verification will be first made. Then the numerical 
model will be applied to describe the interaction of partial dam-break wave and the 
solid/porous structure. 
7.1 The Verification of the Numerical Model 
We first verify present numerical model against the three-dimensional experiment 
performed by Fraccarollo and Toro (1995). The experiments were performed in a 
rectangular water tank which is 3.0 m long, 2.0 m wide and 0.7 m high. The 
rectangular plate is divided into two regions: (1) a rectangular impoundment is 1.0 m 
long, 2.0 m wide and 0.6 m high; and (2) a square dry plate at downstream which is 
provided by the waterproof closure system is 2.0 m long and 2.0 m wide. The perspex 
wall is placed between two regions. The gate is set at the central line of the perspex 
wall. The gate is designed as a swing type gate and the opening time is less than 0.1 
sec. A 0.4 m wide breach is yielded when the gate is opened. Particularly, the open 
boundary condition is applied at outlet for overflowing the water. 
In computations, two numerical tank are used:(1) 3m 2m 0.7m; and (2) 
3m2m0.6375m for simulating the coarse and fine mesh grids testing. Since the 
order of Reynolds number is about  510O  and the symmetric experimental layout, 
the numerical simulation is applied with half of experimental tank to save the 
computational resources. The grids applied to the half computational domain are 
1505035 and 3008060, respectively. The width of perspex walls is set to 1 
cm. The Smagorinsky coefficient is set to 0.15 for the three-dimensional problem. For 
the turbulence field, near the solid faces on which the no-slip boundary condition is 
applied on them, the near-wall damping functions are imposed. In this simulation, the 
zero pressure boundary condition is employed at both the free surface and outlet of 
the computational domain. Note that the zero pressure boundary condition set at outlet 
can simulate the phenomena of the drawdown of the outflow water.  
The experimental measurements are the surface elevation, pressure and velocity

Chapter 8 Conclusions and Future Work 
8.1 Conclusions 
In this study, two major scopes are investigated through a three-dimensional and 
highly accurate numerical model. The first scope is the revisiting of dam-break wave 
hydrodynamics including two- and three-dimensional dam break cases. The second 
scope is to study the interaction of dam-break wave and porous media. 
For these two purposes, a set of three-dimensional macroscopic governing 
equations embedding the spatial-averaged resistance force are derived and employed 
to describe the hydrodynamics of the dam-break interaction with porous structures 
problems. Moreover, the large eddy simulation and moving solid algorithm are 
incorporated in the present numerical model to simulate the turbulent motion and 
effects of gate motions. 
To validate the present numerical model, three experiments and one analytical 
solution are used to compare with numerical results. We first simulate the dam-break 
wave over a dry bed. By comparing computational results with the analytical solution, 
it is found that bore front will reach the speed of 2 gh  when the free-slip bottom 
boundary condition is applied whereas bore front speed will only increase to gh  
when the no-slip condition is employed.  
For the backward wave front speed, it is found the front speed larger than gh  
at very early stage and then decreases to gh  soon. A reflected wave whose speed 
is the same as backward wave front will be generated after the backward wave front 
touches the wall.  
The effects of gate motion and porous media on the evolution of dam-break wave 
are also examined in this study. In particular, the pull-down gate motion which is one 
of possible causes to dam-break failure is examined and discussed. It is found that 
different gate motions give different initial disturbance to the system. Specifically, for 
dam-break wave with a dry bed condition and different gate motions, the final wave 
front profile is similar for propagating a sufficiently long period. On the contrary, for 
dam-break wave with a wet bed condition and different gate motions, the slope of 
interface and surface elevation evolve quite differently. In other words, the dam-break 
wave will be influenced by gate motion. Moreover, the different gate motions lead to 
the time delay of the surface elevation time history.  
Two problems are studied for dam-break wave interaction with porous media. For 
the two-dimensional dam-break wave passing through a porous structure, the presence 
of porous media results in the time delay of surface elevation and reduces the 
discrepancy due to different gate motion. For the three-dimensional dam-break wave 
impacting on a porous structure, the water table in the porous media will be oscillated 
due to the transmission of dam-break wave. From the analyses, the water table

內進行基本的學理探討。該創新研究成果將有助於國內提深對於波浪與
孔隙結構交互作用相關子題之瞭解更進一步。 
其研究成果已陸續發表在過內外知名學術期刊，並積極參與國內外
頗具規模的學術研討會，已達到學術交流與擴展學術深度與廣度之目
的。本計劃所發展的模式除了兼顧實用性與學術性亦可以運用在日後實
務工程設計與評估。就本研究的廣度而言，亦可將本研究所發的模式運
用在不同的波浪型態與孔隙結構的交互作用，該子題亦是具有創新的研
究子題。 
因此本研究的結果不論就學術成就、技術創新與應用價值層面上均
有一定的貢獻。此外，此研究也培育了一位博士及幾位碩士生。

二、參與會議過程 
本次會議地點於北京市之國際會議中心 (National Convention Center) 舉行，會
議於 2010 年 6 月 20 日中午時分整開始註冊，至 2010 年 6 月 25 日下午 4:00 止，
共進行為期 5 天之學術研討及演講活動，6 月 26 日則為選擇性的工程技術參觀 
(technical visit) 。 本人於 6 月 19 日早上搭乘高鐵至桃園搭乘中華航空班機於當地
時間 6月 19日晚上 7:00 抵達北京機場並隨即搭乘計程車至下榻旅館。至旅館後旋
即於隔日至會場進行註冊手續 (registration) 及安頓行李以迎接隔天之開幕演講 
(keynote speech) 與各場次精彩之論文發表。本次會議之開幕演講 (opening speech) 
均著重在外海及能源工業之相關議題，內容包含經濟與工程方面之諸多探討。演講
內容於筆者心中勾勒出未來可行之研究方向，並藉此瞭解身為一個學者所擔負之教
育義務與社會責任。值得一提的是，進行論文發表之前，每場次均安排有 1-2 場精
彩之 Keynote 演講。會議的舉行每個時段共有 5-6 個分組平行舉行，總共有 6個會
議時段，口頭發表之論文多達 669篇以上。本人此次與隨行學生發表之論文時間為
6 月 24 日下午。發表論文宣讀發表時有不同國家之專家學者聆聽，並有來自日
本，台灣及美國學者進行提問討論。在會議討論之外，中場休息 (coffee break) 時
間並與它國學者進行意見交換與交換名片。會議結束後，利用晚宴與各國學者進行
聊天與認識，放鬆連日來些許緊繃之心境。 
三、與會心得 
本人從事海洋工程方面研究已超過 10 年，這幾年尤其要感謝國家科學研究委
員會在出國經費上之大力協助，促成此行實感興奮與驕傲。本會議有相當多知名研
究水利及及海洋工程的專家與會，會議其間針對中重要的海岸問題如極地氣候變遷
所導致的海水位上升、全球暖化及暴風之預測等問題均有詳盡之探討。這些問題亦
是台灣水利及海洋工程目前所面臨且急需解決之難題。雖然許多的議題尚未有完整
的解決方案，但至少提供了一些可能的解決方向。此外，本次會議研究的主題相關
性高，研究具有相當程度上之深度，因此藉由參與會議的討論使本人與指導學生獲
6 
 
四、建議事項 
ISOPE 為研究水利及海洋工程所舉行的國際重要會議，該研討會並收錄會議
期間所發表之創新研究文章於該國際研究論文期刊上  (International Journal of 
Offshore and Polar Engineering)。台灣研究成果如能呈現在國際學術殿堂之上，並
藉由專家學者之互動討論瞭解更創新之研究內容及國際研究方向，方能提升成功大
學在國際上之能見度及學術影響力。筆者建議學校在經費許可前提下，多方鼓勵學
生積極參與國際研究會議並踴躍發表其最新之研究成果至國外期刊，藉此增加與國
內外學者互動交流之機會。然而出國一趟所費不貲，但筆者仍堅信此舉可帶給本校
研究所學生許多國內無法得到之重大影響與寶貴經驗。筆者更期許拓展國際視野並
與世界大學接軌能夠促進成功大學之國際研究水準，期盼有朝一日能與世界頂尖大
學齊名。 
此次主辦單位一如往常的將大會會議內容燒於光碟片內，669 篇文章共計超過
4000頁的內容（計四大冊），可作為未來研究方向之參考。
