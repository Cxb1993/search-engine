Abstract 
 
The construction industry is one of the 
most complex industries because the total 
development of a project normally consists of 
several phases requiring a diverse range of 
specialized services and numerous 
participants involved. To improve 
construction project management effectively, 
the research proposed a framework and 
solution to assist the construction project 
planning and controlling using simulation 
method and supply chain management concept. 
Simulation of construction supply chain 
management using Petri Nets are proposed to 
illustrate how the supply chain concepts and 
Petri Nets are applied in the construction 
projects and to incorporate the participants 
involved in the project to improve the 
advanced project management. Also, 
approaches using Petri Nets are proposed to 
assist modeling and analysis of construction 
project supply chain management integrated 
with construction project management. IDEF 
provides modeling and analysis approaches 
that can be used to effectively study 
understand and analyze business function and 
process modeling. Furthermore, a petri net is 
a formal graphical modeling tool that can be 
efficiently utilized as a process modeling and 
analysis tool because it can graphically 
portray and dynamically analyze a process in 
an integrated manner. This research highlights 
 4 
extensive; for more information readers can 
refer to Murata (1989).  The underlying 
problem from a decision maker’s perspective 
is that these analysis methods require 
extensive computations.  Therefore, the main 
problems behind the use of petri nets for 
process modeling and analysis are size and 
analytical evaluation complexity. In recent 
years, because of the advances made in 
computing technologies, both these problems 
have been alleviated. The problem related to 
the size of the petri nets has been tackled by 
the development of software tools that 
provide graphical interface and hierarchical 
capabilities. Automating a modified version 
of the coverability or reachability tree method 
has solved the problem related to the analysis 
of petri nets. In the new and efficient approach 
for the analysis of petri nets, simulation is 
performed to predict the final state.? 
 
Modeling of Supply Chain Delivery Process 
 
Using the concepts and tools described 
in the previous sections, the authors 
performed modeling and analysis of supply 
chain between a precast elements production 
and general contractor. The model will 
elucidate the steps required in performing 
petri-net-based modeling and analysis of a 
complex construction process. The modeling 
of the precast construction supply chain 
required hierarchical breakdown of precast 
elements supply delivery, usage of tokens, and 
modeling of resources in addition to the usage 
of the standard features of the classical Petri 
Net.  
The objectives of this modeling and 
analysis exercise are to determine the  
n Rate of precast element production in the 
precast plant (supply side). 
n Rate of element installation in the 
construction site (demand side). 
n Resource utilization factors and the effect 
of changing storage capacity policy. 
n Strategies for increasing productivity of 
the supply and demand sides. 
n Study the impact of changing resource 
allocations and availability. 
n Provide a tool that allows time-cost 
tradeoff studies. 
n Find the balance point between supply 
side and demand side. 
The driving force behind this modeling 
and analysis study is to determine the current 
productivity of the plant and to identify factors 
that will lead to improvements in the 
productivity. The focus, therefore, is on 
crucial resources that include the concrete 
trucks that deliver the precast concrete and 
cement tankers that bring cement to the plant. 
It is assumed that the precast concrete plant 
currently utilizes 5 trucks, each with a 
capacity of 3 elements, and one crane, each 
lifting 20 elements per day. In addition, the 
management of the precast concrete plant can 
perform further investigations into such 
aspects as cement shortages and the 
breakdown of important resources 
(equipment). 
 
Main Model 
Two production lines are used in the 
production process. After the producing and 
storage progress, the element is lifted into the 
trucks and delivered to the construction sites. 
After delivery of the element, the trucks return 
to the precast element plant. A number of 
logical assumptions are made in the modeling 
and analysis of the precast element plant. For 
the purpose of this study different types of 
elements are not considered separately in 
supply side. In this study the equipment and 
controls available for proportioning the 
element raw materials are not included. These 
assumptions are in line with the objectives of 
the study. 
This breakdown was performed to 
simplify the modeling of the precast element 
delivery and to demonstrate the hierarchical 
features of petri nets. However, it is possible 
to develop a single model of the precast 
element plant without the use of the 
hierarchical features. In the breakdown of the 
precast element supply delivery, lower-level 
processes have been identified on the basis of 
the physical areas. Appropriate use of the 
hierarchical features of petri nets allows 
simplification of modeling and analysis. 
Further development of the petri net models 
for the precast element supply delivery is 
shown in Figure 2.

obtained in the simulation results it was 
possible to infer that the critical resource 
were the crews.  This was confirmed by the 
fact that variations in the number of crews and 
officers, as simulated in scenario 2-20, will 
have different impact on the completion time.  
The analysis thus focused on the study of 
the effect of variations in the number of crews 
and officers on the installation total duration 
given a certain number of crews and officers.  
With 17 crews it was possible to reduce the 
completion time by approximately 53.93% 
from 22.42 hours in scenario 1 to 10.33 hours 
in scenario 16, by gradually increasing the 
number of crews from 3 to 17 and the number 
of officers from 1 to 3.  The same pattern 
was repeated when 18 crews were used.  
The completion time was reduced from 10.33 
hours in scenario 16 with 16 crews and 2 
officers to 9.98 hours in scenario 17 with 18 
crews and 3 offices. This amounted to 
reduction in completion time of approximately 
1.56 %.  In the final scenario 20, the same 
pattern was repeated when increasing the 
number of trucks from 3 to 6. This reduced the 
completion time from 10.17 hours in scenario 
17 with 18 crews and 3 offices associated 
with 3 trucks to 9.55 hours in scenario 20 
with 18 crews and 3 offices associated with 6 
trucks.  Furthermore, there is no any storage 
in the supply side and any inventory in the 
demand side in scenario 20. However, 
scenario 20 may not the base choice because 
the extra storage in the supply side or extra 
inventory space in the demand side doesn’t 
need extra cost in the real-world construction 
practice.  Therefore, managers and engineers 
can select one of choice based on their 
requirements form the scenario 1 to 20.  
When inventory cost and extra rent cost of 
truck are considered in the scenario, the result 
will be different based on the price of 
inventory cost and extra rent cost of truck. 
With the advent of user friendly and 
intelligent Petri Nets software, engineers and 
managers can advantageously utilize Petri Net 
to analyze the impact of supply-demand 
support delivery in the construction project.  
This is demonstrate in this section by the 
precast element sample that shows the use of 
Petri Nets to be utilized in the area of process 
re-engineering and redesign. There 
application can be in the areas of finance 
analysis, production, distribution and 
inventory management in the construction 
supply chain management files. 
 
??????? 
Petri nets provide a modeling and 
analysis approach that can be applied 
effectively to study, analyze and improve 
construction supply delivery control. This 
work highlights the advanced features of petri 
nets and describes their utilization as 
modeling and analysis tools for construction 
supply chain plan and control.  A petri net is 
a formal graphical modeling tool that can be 
efficiently utilized as a tool for modeling and 
analyzing the supply chain delivery process 
because it can graphically represent and 
dynamically analyze a supply delivery 
process in an integrated way. The study 
contributes considerably to the area of petri 
net modeling and helps practicing project 
managers and engineers on both the demand 
and the supply side, to handle a complex 
supply chain network in construction projects.  
The rules and logistics associated with the use 
of the modeling elements are also very simple, 
making the learning period much shorter than 
those associated with the other process 
modeling tools available. As indicated 
elucidated by the example of the precast 
production plant, petri nets provide integrated 
modeling and analysis features.  Furthermore, 
the simple implementation of hierarchy and 
modularity in petri nets makes such nets 
practically applicable for large and complex 
construction supply chain network.
