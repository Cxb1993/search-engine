Abstract 
The project proposes prediction and analysis 
of identifying protein kinase-specific 
phosphorylation sites based on the features of 
physicochemical properties of sequences. 
This study bases on improving the existing 
methods and achieves the project goal by 
way of the following fours aspects. 1) The 
existing prediction tools to identify protein 
kinase-specific phosphorylation sites have 
very low accuracy for the transmembrane 
proteins. Design an identifying 
transmembrane protein kinase-specific 
phosphorylation sites system. 2) Study the 
special properties of transmembrane proteins 
and create an up to date transmembrane 
protein dataset. 3) The RSA value plays an 
important role in developing explicit models 
for aiding prediction of the phosphorylation 
sites. 4) Investigate informative 
physicochemical and biochemical properties 
of protein sequence to understand the RAS of 
proteins that is helpful in developing protein 
kinase-specific phosphorylation sites 
predicting method. The goal of this project is 
achievement conference and journal papers. 
Keywords: Physicochemical properties, 
kinase-specific phosphorylation, genetic 
algorithms, relative surface area of solvent 
accessibility, protein sequence, prediction 
method. 
 
一.  前言 
蛋白質的磷酸化是在蛋白質轉譯修
飾中很重要機制，在調控基本進行過程例
如新陳代謝、訊號傳遞、細胞分化和細胞
膜穿透性等扮演重要角色。因此預測蛋白
質的磷酸化作用位置是非常重要議題。能
知道蛋白質磷酸化位置，就可以測出蛋白
質功能。雖然最近有許多的磷酸化位點的
預測工具已經發展出來了，但卻還是沒有
一個預測工具是針對膜蛋白 (membrane 
protein)而設計，膜蛋白對於一些生理功能
是很重要的，所以針對膜蛋白的磷酸化位
點預測是一項重要且迫切的課題。 
 
二. 研究目的 
膜蛋白同於具有兩性(同時有書水及
親水性區段)，因此要調整出適合膜蛋白結
晶的環境非常困難。近年來由於蛋白質結
晶技術的進步，讓研究者可以順利取得一
些膜蛋白的結晶資訊。然而針對膜蛋白的
3 
 
以預測器的效能而決定出 threshold，在某
些情況下無法滿足想了解特定殘基的特定
功能，因此發展出預測 RSA 實際值的預測
方法，透過對 RSA 直接預測就能解決上述
問題。 
除此之外，雖然預測工具很多，但卻沒有
一個研究有將不同胺基酸個別探討其物化
特性在蛋白質摺疊上所扮演的角色。本篇
研究也會針對所挑選來的 featrure 做探
討，了解各個殘基的包埋或暴露的物化特
性，進而發現一些原本在預測殘跡暴露與
否的問題中沒有考慮到的因素。這次我們
的方法不但提供了一個可以預測相對暴露
面積的方法，同時我們的方法也提供了一
些資訊，來了解蛋白質折疊的問題。 
目前為止，預測實際相對溶劑暴露面積
的研究很多如表一所示，其中的方法包括
使用 NN，SVR，multi layer regression，
two-stage SVR。 
 
3.3 磷酸結合相關蛋白分析 
蛋白質的磷酸化過程中，除了將磷酸運輸
至目標蛋白進行化學變化外，同時也包含
有蛋白質間作用力。為了要了解蛋白質和
磷酸根之間的作用力，研究需要取得一些
蛋白質和磷酸根作用的資料幫助了解。然
而在蛋白質中沒有一個胺基酸是帶有磷原
子甚至是磷酸根為官能基的胺基酸。DNA
在骨幹(backbone)的部分是磷酸以
phospho-diesterbone 連結磷酸所構成，含
有大量的磷酸根，同時在目前的資料庫裡
也有足夠的資料。Kumar et al.就曾經蒐
集 DNA 結合蛋白作為研究對象，使用支援
向量機做出模型。研究裡我們會使用它們
所使用的 dataset 作為研究對象。 
四.研究方法 
4.1膜蛋白磷酸化位點整理及預測 
4.1.1dataset 的取得 
資料從 uniprot 中擷取，為了要得到更精確
的目標，因此我們只採用有真實實驗數

I. ABSTRACT  
A. Background 
Existing methods of predicting DNA-binding proteins used valuable features of physicochemical properties to design support 
vector machine (SVM) based classifiers. Selection of physicochemical properties and determination of their corresponding 
feature vectors rely mainly on known properties and experience of designers. However, there exists a troublesome problem 
for designers that some different physicochemical properties have similar vectors of representing 20 amino acids and closely 
related physicochemical properties in the same group have dissimilar vectors. 
B. Methods 
This study proposes a systematic approach (named Auto-IDPCPs) to automatically identify a set of physicochemical and 
biochemical properties in the AAindex database to design SVM-based classifiers for predicting and analyzing DNA-binding 
domains/proteins. Auto-IDPCPs consists of 1) clustering 531 vectors in AAindex into 20 classes using a fuzzy c-means 
algorithm, 2) utilizing an efficient genetic algorithm based optimization method IBCGA to select an informative set of 
feature vectors of representing sequences from the viewpoint of machine learning, and 3) analyzing the selected feature 
vectors to identify the related physicochemical properties which may affect the binding mechanism of DNA-binding 
domains/proteins. 
C. Results 
The proposed Auto-IDPCPs identified m=22 features of properties belonging to five classes for predicting DNA-binding 
domains with a five-fold cross-validation accuracy of 87.12%. If m=5 that one representative property is selected from each 
class, the accuracy of 83.59% is also promising compared with the accuracy of 82.07% of the existing method PSSM-400 
using 400 features. For predicting DNA-binding sequences, three additional classes (totally eight classes) were needed, and 
the accuracies of 75.50% and 73.24% were obtained using m=28 and 8 features, respectively, where PSSM-400 has the 
accuracy of 74.22%. When applied on an independent test data set of DNA-binding domains, Auto-IDPCPs and PSSM-400 
have accuracies of 80.73% and 82.81%, respectively. Some typical physicochemical properties discovered are 
hydrophobicity, secondary structure, charge, solvent accessibility, polarity, flexibility, normalized Van Der Waals volume, 
pK (pK-C, pK-N, pK-COOH and pK-a(RCOOH)), etc. 
D. Conclusions 
The proposed approach Auto-IDPCPs would help designers to investigate informative physicochemical and biochemical 
properties by considering both prediction accuracy and analysis of binding mechanism simultaneously. The approach Auto-
IDPCPs can be also applicable to predict and analyze other protein functions from sequences. 
II. BACKGROUND  
DNA-binding domains/proteins are functional proteins in a cell, which plays a vital role in various essential biological 
activities, such as DNA transcription, replication, packaging, repair and rearrangement [1]. The computational methods using 
support vector machine (SVM) in conjunction with evolutionary information of amino acid sequence in terms of their 
position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) for predicting DNA-binding sites were successfully developed [2]. Several 
methods of using machine learning approaches were developed to predict DNA-binding domains/proteins from given 
sequences of variable lengths [3-7], shown Table 1. Due to different design aims and data sets used, it is difficult to assess 
which feature type is the most informative cooperated with SVM by comparing with prediction accuracies only. The PSSM is 
an effective feature type of representing DNA-binding sequences, but its ability of interpretability is not satisfactory enough 
in analyzing the binding mechanism [5]. Besides PSSMs, the physicochemical properties with the characteristics of high 
interpretability were commonly used [3-4, 6-7]. Some issues are concerned in designing prediction methods, described below. 
1) Selection of physicochemical properties: Generally, effective physicochemical properties of amino acids are selected as 
prediction features by using known properties of DNA-binding mechanism and knowledge of related binding mechanism 
[3-4, 6-7]. However, it is desirable to explore undiscovered properties by machine learning approaches to further 
advance the prediction accuracy and understand the binding mechanism. 
2) Representation of sequences: How to effectively represent sequences of variable lengths as a feature vector using 
physicochemical properties play an important role in advancing prediction accuracy. The pseudo-amino acid 
parameter setting of SVM by an efficient feature selection algorithm IBCGA, and 2) a set of physicochemical and 
biochemical properties in the AAindex database for analyzing the DNA-binding mechanism.  
A. Data sets 
To evaluate effectiveness of the identified physicochemical properties by comparing with the famous PSSM features, we 
used the benchmark data sets used in the PSSM-400 method [5], as shown in Table 2. The data set DNAset has 146 DNA-
binding domains (or protein chains) and 250 non-DNA-binding domains. No two domains have the similarity more than 25%. 
The data set DNAaset consists of 1153 DNA-binding proteins and 1153non-binding proteins. 3) An independent data set 
DNAiset is additionally used, having 92 DNA-binding domains and 100 non-DNA-binding domains [5]. 
B. Feature vector representation 
All the domains/sequences have a variable length l. A sequence forms an l-dimensional profile where 
the value of each amino acid is obtained from the specified property in the AAindex database. The l-
dimensional profiles are transformed into vectors with the same constant length L for utilizing SVM. 
The transformation can be any known effective representation [3-4, 6-7] provided that the L features can 
effectively classify the l-dimensional profiles of positive and negative sequences. The simplest feature is 
the mean of the profile that L=1 [10-11]. Therefore, the sequences with m properties are represented as 
an m-dimensional feature vectors. Finally, all values of the feature vectors are normalized into [-1, 1] for 
applying SVM. 
C. Feature selection by IBCGA 
Selecting a minimal number of informative features while maximizing prediction accuracy is a bi-
objective 0/1 combinatorial optimization problem. An efficient inheritable bi-objective combinatorial 
genetic algorithm IBCGA [13] is utilized to solve this optimization problem. IBCGA bases on an 
intelligent genetic algorithm IGA [14] with an inheritable mechanism. The IGA algorithm uses a divide-
and-conquer strategy and an orthogonal array crossover to efficiently solve large parameter optimization 
problems. In this study, the IGA algorithm can efficiently explore and exploit the search space of C(n, r), 
where n=531 in this study. IBCGA can efficiently search the space of C(n, r 1) by inheriting a good 
solution in the space of C(n, r) [13]. Therefore, IBCGA can economically obtain a complete set of high-
quality solutions in a single run where r is specified in an interesting range such as [10, 30]. The 
chromosome encoding scheme of IGA consists of both binary genes for feature selection and parametric 
cluster represented by the cluster prototype vi, s[1,∞) is a weighting exponent called the fuzzifier and 
d(vi, xj) is the distance of xj from the cluster prototype vi. Dembélé and Kastner [15] suggested the 
parameters setting s=1.12 and K=20 clusters, adopted in this study.  
F. Identifying physicochemical properties 
It is not easy to discover related physicochemical properties for analyzing DNA-binding mechanism by 
computational methods with a relatively small size of data sets.  Therefore, we present a hybrid method 
by combining evidences from the viewpoints of both machine learning and biological meanings. Auto-
IDPCPs identifies m properties belong to c of 20 clusters. We examine all properties P1 by considering 
the identified m properties P2 if they satisfying the criteria, P1 is a promising property to be further 
investigated: 1) P1 and P2 have a small distance and 2) if P2 is replaced with P1 one at a time, the 
prediction accuracy is not significantly decreased. 
Only 402 of 531 properties were classified into six groups, (A): Alpha and turn propensities, (B): Beta 
propensity, (C): Composition, (H): Hydrophobicity, (P): Physicochemical properties, and (O): Other 
properties. We classified the other 129 properties into the six groups according their distance of vectors 
using a nearest-neighbor rule. The mapping of 531 feature numbers and AAindex identity and their 
classified result into six groups are given in Tables S1 and S2, respectively, and their statistic result is 
given in Table S3 [see additional file]. The statistical results of property distribution in the six groups for 
531 and 402 amino acid indices are given in Fig. S2 [see additional file]. 
IV. RESULTS  
A. Identified properties by IBCGA 
The statistical result of Sr in selecting property sets from R =30 independent runs on DNAset and DNAaset are given in Fig. 4. 
The 18th and 6th runs for DNAset and DNAaset, respectively, are selected, and their prediction accuracies for various 
numbers of selected properties are given in Fig. 5. The m=22 and 28 properties selected for DNAset and DNAaset, 
respectively, are given in Tables S4 and S5 [see additional file] in which the AAindex identity numbers and their property 
description are provided. An efficient way to study the effects of several factors simultaneously is to use the main effect 
difference (MED) that the most effective property has the largest value of MED. The m properties are ranked by using MED 
is shown in Fig. 6. The properties of rank 1 are feature numbers 86 (FAUJ880109, Localized electrical effect) and 39 
(CHOP780202, Normalized frequency of beta-sheet) for DNAset and DNAaset, belonging to groups Hydrophobicity and 
Beta propensity in the six groups, respectively.

Step 1) (Initiation) Randomly generate an initial population of Npop individuals. All the n binary genes have r 1’s and n-r 0’s 
where r = rstart.  
Step 2) (Evaluation) Evaluate the fitness values of all individuals using f(X).

to form a mating pool. 
Step 4) (Crossover) Select pc·Npop parents from the mating pool to perform orthogonal array crossover on the selected pairs 
of parents where pc is the crossover probability. 
Step 5) (Mutation) Apply the swap mutation operator to the randomly selected pm·Npop individuals in the new population 
where pm is the mutation probability. To prevent the best fitness value from deteriorating, mutation is not applied to 
the best individual. 
Step 6) (Termination test) If the stopping condition for obtaining the solution Xr is satisfied, output the best individual as Xr. 
Otherwise, go to Step 2). 
Step 7) (Inheritance) If r < rend, randomly change one bit in the binary genes for each individual from 0 to 1; increase the

Abstract—DNA-binding domains are functional proteins in a cell, 
which plays a vital role in various essential biological activities. It 
is desirable to predict and analyze novel proteins from protein 
sequences only using machine learning approaches. Numerous 
prediction methods were proposed by identifying informative 
features and designing effective classifiers. The support vector 
machine (SVM) is well recognized as an accurate and robust 
classifier. However, the block-box mechanism of SVM suffers 
from low interpretability for biologists. It is better to design a 
prediction method using interpretable features and prediction 
results. In this study, we propose an interpretable physicochemical 
property classifier (named iPPC) with an accurate and compact 
fuzzy rule base using a scatter partition of feature space for 
DNAbinding data analysis. In designing iPPC, the flexible 
membership function, fuzzy rule, and physicochemical properties 
selection are simultaneously optimized. An intelligent genetic 
algorithm IGA is used to efficiently solve the design problem with 
a large number of tuning parameters to maximize prediction 
accuracy, minimize the number of features selected, and minimize 
the number of fuzzy rules. Using benchmark datasets of DNA-
binding domains, Ippc obtains the training accuracy of 81% and 
test accuracy of 79% with three fuzzy rules and two 
physicochemical properties. Compared with the decision tree 
method with a training accuracy of 77%, iPPC has a more compact 
and interpretable knowledge base. The two physicochemical 
properties are Number of hydrogen bond donors and Helix-coil 
equilibrium constant in the AAindex database.

X.  INTRODUCTION  
DNA-binding domains are functional proteins in a cell, 
which plays a vital role in various essential biological 
activities, such as DNA transcription, replication, packaging, 
repair and rearrangement [1]. These transcription factors are 
mainly DNA-binding proteins (DNA-BPs) coded by 2~3% 
of the genome in prokaryotes and 6~7% in eukaryotes [2]. 
DNA-BPs play a pivotal role in various intra- and extra-
cellular activities ranging from DNA replication to gene 
expression control. These researches reveal that the DNA-
protein recognition mechanism is complicated and there is no 
simple rule for this recognition problem [3]. 
Stawiski et al. found that nucleic acid-binding proteins 
could be separated using a neural network trained that 
included secondary structure and charged patches, among 
others [4]. Ahmad and Sarai using a simple linear predictor 
to model a trivial system with few descriptors and they 
identified cutoff values for charge and dipole moment at 
which binding and non-binding proteins could be 
separated[5]. Kumar et al. proposed a method for predicting 
DNA-binding proteins using SVM and PSSM profiles [6]. 
The methods can fairly analyze and predict DNA-binding 
proteins, but suffer from obtaining human-interpretable 
knowledge. 
Ho et al. [7] study aims to analyze DNA-binding 
proteins via acquisition of interpretable knowledge which 
can accurately predict binding sites in proteins to understand 
DNA-protein recognition mechanism. Their study 
investigates a novel feature set consisting of 11 features, 
including solvent accessibility, secondary structure, charge 
information near the residue, amino acid group and neighbor 
property. The derived binding and non-binding rules reveal 
that besides the well-known solvent accessibility, the 
electric charge distribution near the residue and the amino 
acid groups also play important roles in prediction of 
binding sites. 
We have proposed Auto-IDPCPs [8] which is 
investigated the optimal design of predictors for DNA-DBs 
from amino acid sequence using both informative features 
and an appropriate classifier. Furthermore, we obtain a set 
of relevant physicochemical properties can advance 
prediction performance. The proposed Auto-IDPCPs 
identified m=22 features of properties belonging to five 
clusters for predicting DNA-binding domains with a 
fivefold cross-validation accuracy of 87.12%. Since the set 
of 22 physicochemical properties performs well, we would 
apply it to acquit the rule-based knowledge for predicting 
and analyzing DNA-binding domains.  
intelligent evolutionary algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer 
strategy to effectively solve large parameter optimization 
problems. IGA is shown to be effective in the design of 
accurate classifiers with a compact fuzzy-rule base using an 
evolutionary scatter partition of feature space [10]. 
1) Flexible membership function 
The classifier design of iPPC uses flexible generic 
parameterized fuzzy regions which can be determined by 
flexible generic parameterized membership functions 
(FGPMFs) and a hyperbox-type fuzzy partition of feature 
space. Each fuzzy region corresponds to a parameterized 
fuzzy rule. In this study, each value of gene expression is 
normalized into a real number in the unit interval [0,1]. An 
FGPMF with a single fuzzy set is defined as

where x ∈ [0, 1] and a≤b≤c≤d. The variables a, b, c, and d 
determining the shape of a trapezoidal fuzzy set are the 
parameters to be optimized. It is well recognized that 
confining evolutionary searches within feasible regions is 
often much more reliable than penalty approaches for 
handling constrained problems [12]. Therefore, five 
parameters V1, V2,…, V5[0,1] without constraints instead 
of a, b, c, and d are encoded into a GA-chromosome for 
facilitating IGA. Let an additional variable L=V1 which 
determines the location of the fuzzy set characterizing the 
occurrence of training patterns. When Vi are obtained, 
variables a, b, c, and d can be derived as follows: a=L-
(V2+V3), b=L-V3, c= L+V4, and d=L+(V4+V5). This 
transformation can always make the derived values of a, b, c, 
and d feasible and reduce interactions among encoded 
parameters of GA chromosomes. Some illuminations of 
FGPMF are shown in Fig. 1. 
2) Fuzzy rule and fuzzy reasoning method 
The following fuzzy if–then rules for n-dimensional 
pattern classification problems are used in the design of 
iGEC:  
Rj : If x1 is Aj1 and . . . and xn is Ajn then class CLj with CFj,  
j = 1, . . . , N. 
where Rj is a rule label, xi denotes a PCP variable, Aji is an 
antecedent fuzzy set, C is a number of classes, CLj ∈ 
{1, . . .,C} denotes a consequent class label, CFj is a certainty 
grade of this rule in the unit interval [0, 1], and N is a number of 
initial fuzzy rules in the training phase. 
To enhance interpretability of fuzzy rules, linguistic 
variables in fuzzy rules can be used. Each variable xi has a 
linguistic set U= {L, ML, M, MH, H}. Each linguistic value 
of xi equally represents 1/5 of the domain [0, 1]. Following 
the quantization criterion, we can consider PCPs to be 
regulated according to a qualitative level. For example, xi is 
Low for down-regulated PCPs; xi is Medium for neutral 
PCPs; and xi is High for up-regulated PCPs. An antecedent 
fuzzy set Aji ∈ Au where Au denotes a set of subsets of U. 
Examples of linguistic antecedent fuzzy sets are shown in 
Fig. 2. 
In the training phase, all the variables CLj and CFj are 
treated as parametric genes of GA (GA-genes) encoded in 
chromosomes of GA (GA-chromosomes) and their values 
are obtained using IGA. The following fuzzy reasoning 
method is adopted to determine the class of an input pattern 
xp = (xp1, xp2, . . ., xpn) based on voting using multiple fuzzy 
if–then rules: 
Step 1: Calculate score SClass v(v = 1, . . . , C) for each class 
as follows:

where FC denotes the fuzzy classifier, the scalar value and 
μji(·) represents the membership function of the antecedent 
fuzzy set Aji. 
Step 2: Classify xp as the class with a maximal value of SClass v. 
3) Fitness function  
We define the fitness function Fit() of IGA for designing 
iPPC as follows: 
max Fit(FC) = ACC − WrNr − WfNf                                     (3)

B. Comparison with decision tree 
We random select one run result from iPPC independent 
30 runs. The training ACC is 81%, the number Nf of 
selected PCPs is 2, the number Nr of fuzzy rules is 3, and 
testing ACC is 79%. The selected 2 PCPs are FAUJ880109 
(86) and FINA770101 (91). 
Using J48 in Weka3-6-4, the decision trees are built 
form a set 22 PCPs and the selected 2 PCPs (FAUJ880109 
(86) and FINA770101 (91)) which are shown in Fig. 3(a) 
and Fig.3(b), respectively. The performance of decision 
trees, training accuracy of the 22 PCPs is 77.16% and 
training accuracy of the 2 PCPs is 77.67%. The decision 
value is fixed float value and is not easy to understand.

Fig. 4 shows an example of iPPC using the 2 PCPs with 
3 rules. The classifier has three fuzzy rules using two PCPs 
FAUJ880109(C9H) and FINA770101(C10A), where The 
training ACC = 81% and testing ACC = 79%. 
 
Figure 4. Fuzzy rules of the selected 2 PCPs, the training 
ACC is 81% and testing ACC is 79%. 0: binding, 1: non-
binding.  
Using the selected 2 PCPs, the proposed iPPC can obtain 
rule-based. The fuzzy rules are linguistically interpretable as 
follows: 
R1 If FAUJ880109(C9H) is all and FINA770101(C10A) is 
all , then DNA is binding.(CF=0.290) 
R2 If FAUJ880109(C9H) is {low , medium low , medium } 
and FINA770101(C10A) is all , then DNA is non-
binding.(CF=0.325) 
R3 If FAUJ880109(C9H) is all and FINA770101(C10A) is 
{medium low , medium , medium high , high} , then 
DNA is binding.(CF=0.992) 
XIII.  CONCLUSION 
This paper proposes an interpretable physicochemical 
property classifier (named iPPC) with an accurate and compact 
fuzzy rule base using a scatter partition of feature space for 
DNA-binding data analysis. In designing iPPC, the flexible 
membership function, fuzzy rule, and physicochemical 
properties selection are simultaneously optimized. The 
obtained fuzzy rules are easy to interpret and analyze DNA-
binding domains for biologists.
