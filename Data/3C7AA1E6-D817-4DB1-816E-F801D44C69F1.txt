InP/In0.53Ga0.47As heterointerface (0.34 eV) [14]. 
Reported values of ΔEC for the In0.5Ga0.5P/GaAs 
heterojunction vary between 0.03 and 0.39 eV 
[15]-[18], and a value of ΔEC ~0.19 eV (ΔEV ~0.3 eV) 
is representative [17]. InAlGaP/GaAs, which is 
lattice-matched to GaAs, has the unique merit of a 
very large valence band discontinuity. The valence 
band discontinuity of the In0.5(AlxGa1-x)0.5P/GaAs 
heterojunction increases with Al content, reaching its 
maximum at the InAlP/GaAs interface (0.62 eV) [17]. 
This large valence discontinuity makes the system 
InAlGaP/GaAs attractive for use in the fabrication of 
HBTs. Accordingly, an InAlGaP HBT on GaAs is a 
strong candidate for millimeter-wave low-noise 
application. 
The goal of some research on portable electronic 
devices is to increase efficiency under lower bias 
conditions to increase battery life. To this end, the 
knee voltage (Vknee) and offset voltage (Voffset) of 
HBTs must be reduced. The source of the offset 
voltage has been thoroughly explored [1], [4], [5], [9] 
and is unequivocally associated with the difference 
between the turn-on voltages of the base-emitter and 
the base-collector junctions. The turn-on voltage 
(VBE,on) of bipolar transistors is governed by the 
material properties of the base layer (including the 
base layer bandgap energy and base sheet resistance) 
and also by the type of base-emitter heterojunction 
[3]. Although turn-on voltage has been reduced in 
several types of HBTs, improvements in the turn-on 
voltage are normally at the expense of a decrease in 
current gain. The challenge is to decrease Vknee, Voffset, 
and VBE,on without detrimentally altering other device 
characteristics. 
A large valence-band discontinuity at the 
emitter-base heterojunction is desirable to produce 
high-injection efficiency n-p-n devices. A conduction 
band spike is disfavored, and transistor designs have 
been developed to eliminate or at least mitigate the 
effect of such a spike in HBTs These designs include 
(1) the use of a graded layer in the emitter and (2) the 
interposing of a setback layer between the base and 
the heterointerface. The use of so-called set-back 
layers affects both the injection and recombination of 
electrons. Grading the aluminum composition (x) in 
the emitter-base junction removes the conduction 
band barrier, causing the AlGaAs/GaAs 
heterojunction to act like a GaAs homojunction.  
In the literature, the InAlGaP/GaAs system has 
been developed as such an alternative to 
AlGaAs/GaAs for use in GaAs-based optoelectronic 
devices. Nonetheless, little work has been done on 
the use of the wide-bandgap material InAlGaP as the 
emitter layer in HBTs [7], [8]. The ΔEC of the 
In0.5(AlxGa1-x)0.5P/GaAs heterojunction reportedly 
increases linearly with Al content from 0 to 0.7, 
reaching a peak (0.38 eV) at x=0.7. For 0.7<x<1.0, 
the band structure becomes indirect, and ΔEC falls 
slightly to 0.31 eV as Al content increases [17]. This 
heterojunction with x ≥ 0.2 has a notably larger ΔEC 
( ≥ 0.25 eV) than either the In0.5Ga0.5P/GaAs (0.19 eV) 
or the Al0.25Ga0.75As/GaAs (0.2 eV) heterojunction. 
As a result, the primary concern in the design of 
InAlGaP-based HBTs is the large conduction band 
potential barrier, which arises at the interface of the 
GaAs base and the InAlGaP emitter. Unfortunately, 
no work has been published on this subject. In light of 
the above, this investigation addresses the design of 
optimal InAlGaP/GaAs heterostructures that 
minimize the deleterious effects of a spike. This study 
develops the novel δ-layer emitter structure. 
AlGaAs/GaAs [3], InGaP/GaAs [6], and InP/InGaAs 
[10] HBTs with δ-doping in the spacer region or at 
the spacer-emitter interface were presented. 
The intention of this paper is to assess and 
compare the performance of InAlGaP/GaAs and 
δ-doped InAlGaP/GaAs HBTs. The devices of 
interest are fabricated using an all-wet etching, 
standard mesa process. Such δ-doping lowers the 
barrier at the interface and considerably decreases the 
turn-on voltage, offset voltage, and knee voltage of 
the transistors.  
 
II. Experimental details 
 Both devices were built on GaAs substrates with 
epi layers that were grown by low-pressure 
metal-organic chemical vapor deposition 
(LP-MOCVD). The reference HBT comprised a 50 
nm Al0.3Ga0.7As (n=4x1018 cm-3), a 600 nm GaAs 
subcollector (n=5x1018 cm-3), a 20 nm InGaP etch 
stop layer (n=2x1018 cm-3), a 450 nm GaAs collector 
(n=1x1016 cm-3), a 50 nm C-doped GaAs base 
(p=4x1019 cm-3), a 70 nm In0.5(Al0.3Ga0.7)0.5P emitter 
(N=3x1017 cm-3), a 140 nm GaAs emitter cap 
(n=4x1018 cm-3), a 50 nm grade from GaAs to 
 4
where RE is the parasitic resistance of the emitter; nf is 
the collector current ideality factor for the forward 
operation; nc is the base-collector recombination 
current ideality factor; IS is the transport saturation 
current, and ISC is the base-collector recombination 
saturation current. At very high base current, the first 
team makes significant contributions to the offset 
voltage. Furthermore, when the base current is very 
low or modest, the offset voltage is reduced to,

In the square brackets, the IB component in the first 
parenthesis is in the numerator. Nevertheless, the IB 
component in the second parenthesis is in the 
denominator. Furthermore, nc exceeds nf. As a result, 
a close examination of (2) reveals that an increase in 
IB reduces Voffset. The most likely cause of the 
reduction in Voffset in the δ-HBT is the increase in IS 
and the fall in nf as the temperature is raised. Equation 
(2) demonstrates that the offset voltage increases with 
temperature. 
Figure 5 displays Gummel plots. The 
corresponding dc current gain of each technology is 
displayed. The value of β in the plateau for the 
reference HBT is approximately 41. Surprisingly, the 
β curve of the δ-HBT also exhibits a flat plateau over 
a wide range of collector currents, with a plateau 
value of around 44. The δ-HBT device exhibits 
reduced VBE,on, as displayed in Fig. 6. This figure 
replots the data in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b) in the format of 
IC versus VBE. δ-HBT has a markedly lower VBE than 
the reference HBT over a large range of collector 
current. The collector current ideality factor of the 
δ-HBT is somewhat reduced. The turn-on voltage of 
the devices is also measured between 300 K and 420 
K. For the reference HBT, VBE,on at 300 K is 1.33 V 
and that at 420 K is 1.18 V (at IC =1 mA). The value 
of VBE,on of the δ-HBT declines from 1.25 V to 1.1 V 
at the same collector current density as the 
temperature is increased from 300 K to 420 K. The 
temperature coefficients of VBE,on for both of the 
studied HBTs over this temperature range are similar, 
being around -2.4 mV/K. The decline in the turn-on 
voltage with the increase in temperature is 
presumably caused by the rise in intrinsic carrier 
concentration with temperature. Furthermore, our 
measurements herein reveal a slight drop of less 9% 
in the current gain of the two InAlGaP/GaAs HBTs 
as the temperature in increased 300 K up to 420 K. 
This fall compares very favorably with the previously 
reported results for the Al0.25Ga0.75As/GaAs HBT, for 
which a 69% reduction in current gain is observed as 
the temperature is increased from 300 K 450 K [4]. 
The peak β of the prior InGaP/GaAs HBT falls by 
13.6% from 300 K to 450 K [4]. The value of β of the 
AlGaAs/GaAs HBT falls at a rate that exceeds that of 
InGaP/GaAs HBT as the temperature increases. The 
InAlGaP emitter HBTs exhibit a large improvement 
in the thermal stability of the peak dc current gain 
herein. 
The current gain of conventional HBTs is limited 
by recombination in the emitter-base regime, or by 
reverse injection of holes into the emitter, causing the 
current gain to decline as temperature increases. In 
the devices of interest, since the regime considered 
herein is associated with high currents and no graded 
layer is present between the emitter and the base, the 
space-charge recombination current can be 
disregarded. Additionally, for simplicity, the surface 
recombination current is can be neglected in these 
somewhat large devices. The base current is 
approximately the sum of the base bulk 
recombination current and the current associated with 
the flow of holes that are injected from the base to the 
emitter. Accordingly, the current gain in this case is

where βh is the current gain, which is limited by the 
hole injection current; xB and xE are the base and 
emitter thickness, respectively; NB and NE denote the 
base and emitter doping concentrations, respectively; 
DpE is the hole diffusion coefficient in the emitter 
layer and DnB is the electron diffusion coefficient in 
the base. Equation (3) supports some important 
qualitative deductions. The weak dependence of β on 
temperature in the devices herein suggests that the 
InAlGaP/GaAs heterojunction almost eliminates the 
back injection of holes from the base into the emitter.
