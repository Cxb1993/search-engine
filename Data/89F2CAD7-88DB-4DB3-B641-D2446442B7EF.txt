an Aalborg® mass flow meter. The water flow loop consists of 
a variable speed gear pump that delivers water. The mixer was 
designed to provide better uniformity of the flow stream. The 
inlet temperatures of air and water were conducted at near 25°C. 
Three very accurate Yokogawa flow meters with different 
applicable flow ranges are installed at the downstream of the 
gear pump. The accuracy of the air and water mass flow meters 
is within ±0.2% of the test span. After splitting through the U-
type junction, the mixture flow leaving from each outlet leg, air 
and water are separated by an open water tank. 
The separated air and water flow rates from the lower leg 
are measured by another sets of Aalborg® mass flowmeters and 
Yokogawa flow meters, and then the air is vented and the water 
is re-circulated. The air and water temperatures were measured 
by resistance temperature device (Pt100Ω) having a calibrated 
accuracy of 0.1 K (calibrated by Hewlett-Packard quartz 
thermometer probe with quartz thermometer, model 18111A 
and 2804A). Detailed description of the test apparatus and the 
estimated uncertainties of the measurements had been 
previously reported [5, 6].  
Two horizontal glass tubes with the presence of two 
vertically split U-type Junctions having 6.7 mm diameter (D) 
with two curvature ratios (2R/D) of 3 and 7 are utilized for tests. 
To achieve a fully developed flow condition for visual 
observation, a straight entrance length of 100D is located at the 
upper stream of the inlet leg and an outlet length of 60D is 
located at each downstream leg as shown in Fig. 2. The 
roughness of the glass tubes is measured by Mahr Perthometer 
(model M4Pi-RK) having an accuracy of 0.01 μm. The mean 
roughness of glass tubes is less than 0.04 μm.

The total mass flux (G) is ranged from 100 to 700 kg/m2⋅s 
and quality (x) is changed from 0.001 to 0.5. Observations of 
flow patterns are obtained from images produced by a high 
speed camera of Redlake Motionscope PCI 8000s. The 
maximum camera shutter speed is 1/8000 second. The high 
speed camera is positioned to obtain the side views of the 
vertically split U-type junction.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Photographs that are representative of the observed flow 
patterns for D = 6.7 mm with curvature ratio (2R/D) of 3 and 7 
at mass flow flux of 100 kg/m2⋅s having vapor qualities of 
0.001 and 0.009, 0.05 and 0.5 are displayed in Figs. 3, 4, 5, and 
6, respectively, as well as G = 300 kg/m2⋅s having x = 0.001, 
0.009 and 0.09 are shown in Figs. 7, 8, 9, respectively. The 
visual results show the flow patterns in the presence of 
vertically split U-type junction. The measured results of air and 
water mass flux in the upper and lower outlet legs having G = 
100, 300 and 700 kg/m2⋅s for 2R/D = 3 and 7 are also shown in 
the Figs. 10 – 15.  
 
3.1 Flow patterns observation

As the mass flux is further increased to 300 kg/m2⋅s, the 
influence of inertia force outperforms the gravity force. For x = 
0.001 (Fig. 7), the inlet flow pattern is plug flow having a short 
plug length (about 1-2 cm). As the air plug reaches the split U-
type junction, it momentarily stays at the junction by the 
buoyancy force, while most of the flow in the coming liquid 
slug is going down to the lower leg by the gravity force. Only a 
smaller portion of liquid flow goes to the upper leg with the air 
plugs as liquid film spread around the tube periphery and liquid 
membrane between two consecutive air plugs. The pending air 
plug is caught by the next air plug to form a bigger plug. Most 
of the air plugs flow to the upper leg and the flow pattern 
changes to slug flow at the outlet. In addition, a small portion 
of the airflow goes to the lower leg by the liquid inertial force 
and becomes bubbly flow in the lower leg.

As the gas quality increases to x = 0.009, the inlet flow is 
wavy stratified flow (Fig. 8). When the higher liquid reaches 
the split junction, it will directly impact on the convex part of 
the U-type bend. Part of the liquid flow is pushed to the convex 
surface of the upper 90˚ bend, then the liquid is swirled up 
around the periphery to form a temporary annular flow in the 
upper leg and the flow pattern will change to stratified flow by 
the outlet of the upper leg. Since most of the liquid flow goes 
down to the lower leg, the wavy stratified flow is still observed 
in the lower leg but with a swirled flow appeared in the lower 
upper 90˚ bend. As gas quality further increases to x = 0.09 
(Fig. 9), the inlet flow pattern is annular flow. As the flow 
across the split junction, the gas inertial force still high, thus, 
the flow patterns in the upper and lower legs remain in annular 
flow. However, the liquid flow in the lower tube is higher such 
that its flow pattern is more closed to semi-annular flow.

observed due to the influence of gravity. This is caused by the 
height difference between the upper and lower legs. For the air 
flow curves of the upper and lower legs are also shown in Figs. 
10-15. There is no consistent trend, however, the air mass 
fluxes in the upper and lower legs is always increased with the 
rise of gas quality and the total mass flux.

4. CONCLUSION 
1. Two-phase flow phenomenon, such as "freezing slug" can 
be observed for 2R/D = 7 by buoyancy force, and temporary 
annular flow can be observed for 2R/D = 3 by centrifugal force 
in vertically split U-type junctions.  
2. The ratio of liquid distribution between the upper and lower 
outlet legs is highly depending on the inlet flow pattern. 
3. Higher liquid flow rate into the lower leg and smaller flow 
rate into the upper tube are observed by the gravity effect. 
Therefore, there has large flow pattern changes in the split U 
junction of D = 6.7 mm from the inlet tube to the two dividing 
outlet legs. 
4. As the total mass flux is increased, the water flow flux 
difference between the upper and lower legs is getting smaller 
by the increase of inertial force of gas phase. 
5. The difference between the water fluxes of upper and lower 
legs is reduced for smaller curvature radius because the gravity 
effect is smaller with shorter height difference between the 
upper and lower legs.
