Abstract 
Nano-crystalline Ti(N,O) thin films were 
investigated successfully with addition of 
oxygen and nitrogen at 350℃ deposited by 
unbalanced magnetron sputtering system. 
The composition, structure and properties 
were affected by oxygen flow rate. The phase 
transformation from TiN to Ti3O5 by the 
addition of oxygen atom was revealed by the 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and 
XRD results. The texture changed from 
random distribution to (111) preferred 
orientation and then to (200) texture structure 
which may result from the fact of oxygen 
atoms stuck on (200) plane of TiN. The 
corrosion resistance of potentiodynamic 
polarization test was influenced by Ti3O5 
phase in films which showed better corrosion 
resistance with higher packing density. The 
coloration of thin films changed from 
warmer golden to vivid green and then to 
pink because the available free d electrons in 
Ti atoms were changed by N/Ti ratio. 
 
Introduction 
The transition metal nitride coatings, like 
TiN and ZrN thin films, are nowadays 
popular applications for their high hardness, 
golden color and good corrosion resistance 
[1,2]. However, the lack of color variation 
and small range of corrosion resistance are 
limited in commercial industries [3,4]. We 
adopted the parameter of deposition method 
of TiN and addition of oxygen to enhance the 
properties of titanium nitride thin films. 
Surface coatings by physical vapor 
deposition (PVD) and chemical vapor 
deposition (CVD) are widely used in industry. 
Especially, the unbalanced magnetron 
sputtering for PVD can lead to larger 
discharge currents and higher sputter 
deposition rate to modify the coating 
properties [5,6,7]. The coloration change can 
be controlled by increasing the content of 
oxygen during the titanium nitride coating 
process. The objective of the research is to 
modify the microstructure, texture, coloration 
variation, mechanical properties and 
corrosion behavior of Ti(N,O) thin films by 
choosing oxygen flow rate as a 
single-variable parameter. The Ti(N,O) thin 
films were deposited on the mirror AISI 304 
stainless steel by unbalanced sputtering 
system. 
 
Experimental Details

Fig. 2 The variation of packing density with oxygen content 
 
In deposition process, TiN phase 
continuously transforms to Ti3O5 which has a 
lower packing density than TiN. The packing 
density decreases consequentially with 
increasing oxygen content. 
 
3.3 Texture Evolution  
The XRD patterns (Fig.3) of Ti(N,O) films 
showed that the (111) and (200) peaks of TiN 
phase appeared ranging from 3.4 to 31 at% 
of oxygen content, and then transformed to 
the oxidative phase of Ti3O5 as the oxygen 
content is larger than 34 at.%.

oxygen flow rate ranging from 0 to 1.5 sccm 
 
In our previous study, Lau et. al. [3] has 
shown the relationship between preferred 
orientation and the stoichiometric variation 
of film. While the (200) plane has strong 
bonding states of (pd)σ, (pd)π, the (111) 
plane only consists of Ti-Ti (dd)σ bonding 
state [9]. It showed that TiN films trended to 
show (200) preferred orientation for N/Ti<1, 
and (111) preferred orientation for N/Ti>1. 
With increasing oxygen content, both (111) 
and (200) peaks decreased and (220) peak 
occurred. Since the dissociated energy of 
oxygen (5.13 eV) is about half of nitrogen 
(10.28 eV), the coverage of oxygen atom 
could be more favorable than nitrogen atom 
on the TiN (200) plane. Furthermore, the 
adatoms of (200) shows a larger mean free 
path with a higher probability to leave the 
plane of (200) until adatoms are trapped on 
the adjacent (111) plane. Therefore, higher 
oxygen content may cause texture 
transformation in TiN thin film easily than 
nitrogen. Such texture evolution caused by 
oxygen addition has been previously reported 
in TiNxOy and ZrNxOy films[10, 11, 12,13]. 
 
3.4 Corrosion properties 
From Fig. 4, the Icorr and Ecorr varied with 
different oxygen content from 4 at.% to 43 
at.% tested in 1N H2SO4 + 0.05M KSCN 
solution.

Conclusions 
1. Ti(N,O) thin films were successfully  
deposited on an AISI 304 stainless steel 
substrate by unbalanced magnetron 
sputtering system with a variety of oxygen 
content. 
2. The packing density of Ti(N,O) thin 
films  
decrease with increasing oxygen content 
because the crystal structure transforms to a 
loose Ti3O5 phase. 
3. The texture evolution of NaCl-type TiN  
phase changes from the (111) preferred 
orientation to the (200) dominated 
orientation occurred at 23 at % of oxygen 
content in Ti(N,O) thin films. 
4. The corrosion resistance of TiN films  
with higher packing density showed higher 
corrosion resistance. With appearance of 
Ti3O5 phase, increase of Icorr is resulted 
from decrease of the packing density. 
5. The coloration of TiNxOy thin films  
changed from light gold to dark gold to pink 
with oxygen content increased. N/Ti ratio 
and packing density might be the major 
factors to influence the L*, a*, b* values of 
films.

used as the substrate. The specimens were 
ultrasonically cleaned in acetone and ethanol, 
then pre-sputtered at 350℃ to remove the 
contaminations. The flow rate of argon and 
nitrogen were fixed at 50 and 2.5 sccm. The 
oxygen flow rate was the controlling 
parameter ranged from 0 to 1.5 sccm with 
0.25 sccm increment.  
 
2.2 Characterization analysis 
The crystal structure and preferred 
orientation were determined by XRD. The 
texture coefficient is calculated by the 
following equation ( )
( )
I hkl
I hkl∑ , where I is the 
integrated intensity of the corresponding 
peaks. A CAMECA IMS-4F SIMS apparatus 
was employed with a Ga+ ion beam at an 
energy of 25 KeV  to determine the 
composition profile of Ti(N,O) thin films. 
Simulated atomic density (SAD, #/cm2) can 
be calculated by Rutherford Backscattering 
Spectroscopy (RBS) analysis. The film 
packing density (#/cm3) can be obtained by 
the following equation  
1510 ( )SAD RBSD
t
⋅= , where the D is the 
actual atom density of deposited film (#/cm3), 
and t is actual film thickness obtained by 
SEM observation.  
The corrosion behavior of the thin films was 
characterized by the potentiodaynamic 
polarization method. The specimens were 
tested in the o.5M H2SO4 + 0.05M KSCN 
solution for 30 minutes to measure the 
corrosion resistance.  
 
Results and Discussions  
3.1 Substitution 
The element fraction of thin film in atomic 
percent for Ti, N and O versus oxygen flow 
rate was showed in Fig. 1. The nitrogen 
content decrease and the oxygen content 
increase with increasing of the oxygen flow 
rate. The content of O is larger than the 
content of N when the oxygen flow rate is 
above 0.625 sccm.

Martin et al [8] have reported that the 
nitrogen is easily substituted by oxygen in 
TiN films during film growth. Compared to 
nitrogen, the oxygen atom has relatively 
stronger affinity with titanium. Also, the TiN 
crystal has high concentration of point 
defects to provide the substitutional sites. 
With the reasons mentioned above, the 
oxygen content increased during the 
deposition process, and the oxygen 
substitution may lead the transition from TiN 
phase to Ti3O5 phase. 
 
3.2 Packing Density 
The packing density showed a strong 
dependence that decreased with the oxygen 
content increase in both TiN and Ti3O5 thin 
films in Fig. 2.

Ti(N,O) showed a weakly dependence on 
oxygen content from 0 to 31 at.%. The Icorr 
increases from 4600 nA/cm2 to 5058 nA/cm2 
when oxygen content is above 31 at.%. The 
thin films showed lower corrosion rate with 
Ti3O5 phase in TiN thin films.

It is reported that the packing factor is more 
important than film thickness to the corrosion 
resistance for the coating [14], because the 
higher packing density has lower content of 
pinhole for corrosive solution to reach. Fig. 6 
shows the variation of Icorr with the packing 
density in which the oxygen content is above 
34 at.%. Apparently, Icorr decreases with 
increasing packing density.

3.5 Coloration Variations 
The colors of the thin films were quantified 
in the CIE L＊a＊b＊ color space. The 
coloration of Ti(N,O) thin films can be 
divided into four groups: gold and gold 
brown, purple and blue, green, and pink (Fig. 
7). The coloration of thin films in lower 
oxygen content (22 at.%) changes from light 
gold to dark gold with the increasing oxygen 
content. Then it changes from purple to dark 
blue up to 32 at.% oxygen content. The films 
finally become green and transform to pink 
until Ti3O5 phase appeared. 
 
Fig.7 Coloration Variation with oxygen flow rate 
 
The b＊ values in Fig.8 increase with 
increasing N/Ti ratio. Niyomsoan [15] has 
applied the Intrband absorption mechanism 
to discuss the relationship between b＊ and 
N/Ti ratio. He suggested the transition 
mainly caused by free electrons. So the b＊ 
values, which means the yellowness, increase 
with increasing N/Ti ratio because the 
electron charges of transition metal transfer 
to nitrogen to form the transition metal 
nitride.
