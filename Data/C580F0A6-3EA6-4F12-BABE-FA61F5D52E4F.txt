21 Introduction
This paper deals with sensitivity analysis of parametric vector optimization problems.
We first give some notations and definitions.
Let f : P ×X → Y be a vector function and let C : P ⇒ X be a multifunction,
where P,X, Y are Euclidean spaces equipped with the usual norms. Let F : P ⇒ Y
be a multifunction given by
F (p) := f(p, C(p)) = {f(p, x) : x ∈ C(p)}. (1)
Let K ⊂ Y be a pointed, closed, convex cone with apex at the origin. The cone K
induces a partial order K on Y, i.e.,
y K y′ ⇔ y′ − y ∈ K, y, y′ ∈ Y. (2)
Definition 1.1 We say that y ∈ A is an extremum of a subset A ⊂ Y with respect to
K if and only if (y−K)∩A = {y}. The set of extrema of A is denoted by extrKA.We
stipulate that extrK∅ = ∅. If K equals (or contains, is contained in) the nonnegative
(in the sense of (2)) orthant of Y , then the set of extrema of A is denoted by minKA;
if K equals (or contains, is contained in) the nonpositive (in the sense of (2)) orthant
of Y , then the set of extrema of A is denoted by maxKA.
We consider the following parametric vector optimization problem:
F(p) := extrK
{
f(p, x) : x ∈ C(p)} = extrKF (p), (3)
where x is the unknown (decision variable) and p ∈ P a parameter.
Remark 1.1 In the literature, especially that related to the economic applications,
the elements of extrKA are called efficient points. For each p, the image F(p) of the
multifunction F : P ⇒ Y , defined by problem (3), is the set of extrema of (3). The
multifunction F is called here extremum multifunction (in the literature, it is known
also as efficient point multifunction).
Sensitivity analysis in vector optimization problems, that is, the behavior of the
extremum multifunction F is analyzed by using certain concepts of generalized deriva-
tives for multifunctions. The papers by Tanino [1, 2] are among the first results in this
field. In those papers, the author has studied the behavior of F via the concept of
contingent derivative introduced by Aubin [3]. The notion of contingent epiderivative
in vector optimization with multifunctions has been introduced by Jahn and Rauh [4].
Various sensitivity analysis results in this direction can be found in Shi [5, 6], Kuk,
Tanino, and Tanaka [7, 8]. Generalized contingent epiderivatives have been indepen-
dently introduced by Chen and Jahn [9] and by Bednarczuk and Song [10]; the study
of sensitivity of a family of parametric optimization problems with multifunctions has
been examined in the latter paper. Later, Song and Wan [11] used this concept to de-
rive some sensitivity results on parametric vector optimization problems. Namely, the
authors gave a representation of generalized contingent epiderivative of F in terms of
4Definition 2.1 (i) A multifunction F is upper locally Lipschitz at p¯ ∈ domF if there
exist U ∈ N (p¯) and a real number M > 0 such that
F (p) ⊂ F (p¯) +M ||p− p¯||BY , ∀p ∈ U.
(ii) F is pseudo-Lipschitz at (p¯, y¯) ∈ gphF if there exist U ∈ N (p¯) and V ∈ N (y¯)
and a real number M > 0 such that
F (p1) ∩ V ⊂ F (p2) +M ||p1 − p2||BY , ∀p1, p2 ∈ U.
Definition 2.2
(i) F is said to be convex if
αF (p) + (1− α)F (p′) ⊂ F (αp+ (1− α)p′), ∀p, p′ ∈ P, ∀α ∈ [0, 1].
(ii) F is said to be K-convex if
αF (p) + (1− α)F (p′) ⊂ F (αp+ (1− α)p′) +K, ∀p, p′ ∈ P, ∀α ∈ [0, 1].
It is known (see e.g. [2]) that F is convex if and only if gphF is a convex set in
P × Y. According to [15, Lemma 14.8], F is K-convex if and only if epiF is a convex
set in P × Y.
In this paper, we make the following assumptions:
(A) C in (3) is convex and f in (3) is K-convex;
(B) F in (1) is K-convex.
As shown in [2, Proposition 2.1], (A) implies (B). Given a subset Ω ⊂ Y , we denote
the interior and the closure of Ω by intΩ and clΩ. When Ω is convex and nonempty,
the set
0+Ω := {y ∈ Y : Ω + y ⊂ Ω}
is called the recession cone of Ω. Let y¯ ∈ clΩ. The Bouligand tangent cone (or con-
tingent cone) and the Clarke tangent cone to Ω at y¯ are defined by
TB(Ω; y¯) := {v ∈ Y : ∃{tn} ⊂ (0,+∞), tn → 0,∃{vn} ⊂ Y, vn → v, with y¯ + tnvn ∈ Ω, ∀n},
TC(Ω; y¯) := {v ∈ Y : ∀{y¯n} ⊂ Ω, y¯n → y¯, ∀{tn} ⊂ (0,+∞), tn → 0,∃{vn} ⊂ Y, vn → v,
with y¯n + tnvn ∈ Ω, ∀n}.
It is well known that these cones are closed and TC(Ω; y¯) is convex. Moreover,
TC(Ω; y¯) ⊂ TB(Ω; y¯) and TC(Ω; y¯) = TB(Ω; y¯) when Ω is a convex set.
In what follows, we also use projections of the Bouligand tangent cone and the
Clarke tangent cone to sets in the product space P × Y on the space Y . Given a
subset Ω˜ ⊂ P × Y, for (p¯, y¯) ∈ clΩ˜, we define the corresponding projections at u ∈ P
by
ΠuT
B(Ω˜; (p¯, y¯)) := {y ∈ Y : (u, y) ∈ TB(Ω˜; (p¯, y¯))},
ΠuT
C(Ω˜; (p¯, y¯)) := {y ∈ Y : (u, y) ∈ TC(Ω˜; (p¯, y¯))}.
6Proposition 2.2 Let (p¯, y¯) ∈ gphF. If
Π0TP(gphF ; (p¯, y¯)) := {y ∈ Y : (0, y) ∈ TP(gphF ; (p¯, y¯))} = {0}, (6)
then F is directionally compact at (p¯, y¯).
Proof. We consider arbitrary sequences {tn} ⊂ (0,+∞), tn → 0, {hn} ⊂ P, hn →
h ∈ P, {yn} ⊂ Y with y¯ + tnyn ∈ F (p¯+ tnhn) for all n. Since Y is finite-dimensional,
it is sufficient to show that the sequence {yn} is bounded. Suppose by contradiction
that lim
n→∞
||yn|| =∞. Set
y˜n =
yn
||yn|| , h˜n =
hn
||yn|| , t˜n = tn||yn||.
Then, t˜ny˜n = tnyn, t˜nh˜n = tnhn, ||y˜n|| = 1 for all n and h˜n → 0, t˜nh˜n → 0. By taking
a subsequence if necessary, we may assume that lim
n→∞
y˜n = y˜ with ||y˜|| = 1. Putting
pˆn = p¯+ t˜nh˜n, yˆn = y¯ + t˜ny˜n, tˆn =
1
t˜n
,
we have yˆn ∈ F (pˆn) for all n and pˆn → p¯, tˆn(pˆn − p¯, yˆn − y¯) → (0, y˜). This means
that (0, y˜) ∈ TP(gphF ; (p¯, y¯)), contrary to the assumption Π0TP(gphF ; (p¯, y¯)) = {0}.
Thus the proof is complete. 2
Note that the condition (6) has served well as a qualification condition for having
the so-called protodifferentiability of F in [13].
Definition 2.5 (i) The set Ω ⊂ Y is said to satisfy the domination property if
Ω ⊂ extrKΩ +K.
(ii) We say the domination property holds for F around p¯ ∈ P if there exists U ∈ N (p¯)
such that
F (p) ⊂ extrKF (p) +K, ∀p ∈ U.
3 Generalized Clarke Epiderivatives of the Extremum
Multifunction without Constraints
In this section, we provide the formulas for computing and/or estimating the gen-
eralized Clarke epiderivative of the extremum multifunction F in (3) via the Clarke
tangent cone to the graph of F in (1). To do this, we need first to compute or estimate
the generalized Clarke epiderivative of the multifunction F.
Proposition 3.1 Let assumption (B) be satisfied and let (p¯, y¯) ∈ gphF. We have
DCF (p¯, y¯)(u) ⊂ extrKΠuTC(gphF ; (p¯, y¯)), ∀u ∈ P, (7)
and the converse inclusion holds if
epiDCF (p¯, y¯) = TC(epiF ; (p¯, y¯)). (8)
8Thus,
(u, y − b) ∈ TB(epiF ; (p¯, y¯)).
As epiF is a convex set, we get (u, y − b) ∈ TC(epiF ; (p¯, y¯)). So,
y − b ∈ ΠuTC(epiF ; (p¯, y¯)). (12)
Since y − b K y and y − b 6= y, (12) contradicts the fact that
y ∈ extrKΠuTC(epiF ; (p¯, y¯)).
Therefore, our claim follows, i.e., lim
n→∞
kn
tn
= 0. Taking into account (10), we have
(u, y) ∈ TC(gphF ; (p¯, y¯)) and thus (9) is satisfied.
We now show that, for each u ∈ P,
ΠuT
C(gphF ; (p¯, y¯)) +K ⊂ ΠuTC(epiF ; (p¯, y¯)). (13)
Take any y ∈ ΠuTC(gphF ; (p¯, y¯)) and k ∈ K. Since TC(gphF ; (p¯, y¯)) ⊂ TB(gphF ; (p¯, y¯)),
we have y ∈ ΠuTB(gphF ; (p¯, y¯)). Then, there exist sequences {(un, yn)} ⊂ P × Y,
(un, yn)→ (u, y) and {tn} ⊂ (0,+∞), tn → 0 such that
y¯ + tnyn ∈ F (p¯+ tnun), ∀n.
Let y¯n = yn + k for all n. Then, (un, y¯n)→ (u, y + k) and
y¯ + tny¯n = y¯ + tnyn + tnk ∈ F (p¯+ tnun) +K, ∀n.
Hence,
(u, y + k) ∈ TB(epiF ; (p¯, y¯)) = TC(epiF ; (p¯, y¯)),
where the equality holds by the convexity of epiF. So y+ k ∈ ΠuTC(epiF ; (p¯, y¯)) and
thus (13) has been established. Combining (9) with (13) gives
DCF (p¯, y¯)(u) ⊂ ΠuTC(gphF ; (p¯, y¯)) ⊂ ΠuTC(epiF ; (p¯, y¯)).
This justifies (7).
If epiDCF (p¯, y¯) = TC(epiF ; (p¯, y¯)), then it follows from (13) that
ΠuT
C(gphF ; (p¯, y¯)) +K ⊂ ΠuTC(epiF ; (p¯, y¯)) = DCF (p¯, y¯)(u) +K, ∀u ∈ P.
Combining this with (7) gives us
extrKΠuT
C(gphF ; (p¯, y¯)) +K ⊂ DCF (p¯, y¯)(u) +K
⊂ extrKΠuTC(gphF ; (p¯, y¯)) +K, ∀u ∈ P.
Thus,
extrKΠuT
C(gphF ; (p¯, y¯)) ⊂ DCF (p¯, y¯)(u), ∀u ∈ P,
and the proof is complete. 2
We now give a condition ensuring the equality (8).
10
Hence,
TC(epiF ; (p¯, y¯)) = TC(epiF ; (p¯, y¯)).
This implies that, for each u ∈ P,
ΠuT
C(epiF ; (p¯, y¯)) = ΠuTC(epiF ; (p¯, y¯));
thus, DCF(p¯, y¯)(u) = DCF (p¯, y¯)(u). To complete the proof, it remains to apply
Proposition 3.1. 2
As a consequence of Theorem 3.1 and Proposition 3.2, we have the following result.
Corollary 3.1 Let assumption (B) be satisfied and let (p¯, y¯) ∈ gphF . Suppose that
the domination property holds for F around p¯. If DCF (p¯, y¯)(0) 6= ∅, then
DCF(p¯, y¯)(u) = extrKΠuTC(gphF ; (p¯, y¯)), ∀u ∈ P.
4 Generalized Clarke Epiderivatives of Extremum
Multifunction with Constraints
We consider now the problem (3) with constraint mapping C : P ⇒ X. Define C˜ :
P × Y ⇒ X as follows:
C˜(p, y) = {x ∈ C(p) : y − f(p, x) ∈ K}. (18)
In this section, our first auxiliary result is the following.
Proposition 4.1 Let p¯ ∈ P and x¯ ∈ C(p¯). Suppose that f is Fre´chet differentiable
at (p¯, x¯). If assumption (B) is satisfied, then
{∇f(p¯, x¯)(p, x) : (p, x) ∈ TC(gphC; (p¯, x¯))}+K ⊂ ΠpTC(epiF ; (p¯, y¯)), ∀p ∈ P,
(19)
where ∇f(p¯, x¯) is the Fre´chet derivative operator of f at (p¯, x¯) and y¯ = f(p¯, x¯).
Furthermore, if assumption (B) is replaced by assumption (A) and C˜ defined in (18)
is directionally compact at ((p¯, y¯), x¯), then the converse inclusion of (19) is valid, i.e.,
{∇f(p¯, x¯)(p, x) : (p, x) ∈ TC(gphC; (p¯, x¯))}+K = ΠpTC(epiF ; (p¯, y¯)), ∀p ∈ P.
(20)
Proof. We first show that
{∇f(p¯, x¯)(p, x) : (p, x) ∈ TC(gphC; (p¯, x¯))} ⊂ ΠpTB(gphF ; (p¯, y¯)), ∀p ∈ P. (21)
For each p ∈ P, let (p, x) ∈ TC(gphC; (p¯, x¯)). This implies that (p, x) ∈ TB(gphC; (p¯, x¯));
thus, there exist sequences {tn} ⊂ (0,+∞), tn → 0 and {(pn, xn)} ⊂ P×X, (pn, xn)→
(p, x) with x¯+ tnxn ∈ C(p¯+ tnpn), for all n. We have
f(p¯+ tnpn, x¯+ tnxn) ∈ F (p¯+ tnpn), ∀n.
12
Corollary 4.1 Let assumption (A) be satisfied and let p¯ ∈ P, x¯ ∈ C(p¯). Suppose that
f is Fre´chet differentiable at (p¯, x¯). Let one of the following requirements be fulfilled:
(i) C is upper locally Lipschitz at p¯ ∈ domC, with C(p¯) = {x¯}.
(ii) Π0T
C(gphC; (p¯, x¯)) = {0}.
(iii) C˜ defined in (18) is upper locally Lipschitz at (p¯, y¯) ∈ domC˜, with C˜(p¯, y¯) =
{x¯} where y¯ = f(p¯, x¯).
(iv) Π(0,0)T
C(gphC˜; ((p¯, y¯), x¯)) = {0}, where y¯ = f(p¯, x¯).
Then, (20) holds.
Proof. Since C is convex and f is K-convex, we have that gphC and gphC˜ are
convex sets. Thus, TC(gphC; (p¯, x¯)) = TP (gphC; (p¯, x¯)) and TC(gphC˜; ((p¯, y¯), x¯)) =
TP (gphC˜; ((p¯, y¯), x¯)). The desired result is now immediate from Propositions 2.1, 2.2,
4.1 and Remark 4.1. 2
Proposition 4.2 Let assumption (A) be satisfied and let p¯ ∈ P, x¯ ∈ C(p¯). Suppose
that f is Fre´chet differentiable at (p¯, x¯). If C˜ defined in (18) is pseudo-Lipschitz at
((p¯, y¯), x¯), where y¯ = f(p¯, x¯), then (20) holds.
Proof. In view of Proposition 4.1, it suffices to prove that
ΠpT
C(epiF ; (p¯, y¯)) ⊂ {∇f(p¯, x¯)(p, x) : (p, x) ∈ TC(gphC; (p¯, x¯))}+K, ∀p ∈ P.
(23)
For each p ∈ P, take any y ∈ ΠpTC(epiF ; (p¯, y¯)), i.e., (p, y) ∈ TC(epiF ; (p¯, y¯)). It fol-
lows that (p, y) ∈ TB(epiF ; (p¯, y¯)). Then, there exist sequences {tn} ⊂ (0,+∞), tn →
0 and {(pn, yn)} ⊂ P × Y, (pn, yn)→ (p, y) with
y¯ + tnyn ∈ F (p¯+ tnpn) +K, ∀n.
On the other hand, since C˜ is pseudo-Lipschitz at ((p¯, y¯), x¯), there exist U1 ∈ N (p¯), U2 ∈
N (y¯), V ∈ N (x¯), and M > 0 such that
C˜(p1, y1) ∩ V ⊂C˜(p2, y2) +M(||p1 − p2||2 + ||y1 − y2||2) 12BX ,
∀p1, p2 ∈ U1,∀y1, y2 ∈ U2. (24)
Choose δ > 0 such that p¯+ δBP ⊂ U1, y¯ + δBY ⊂ U2. It follows from (24) that
x¯ ∈ C˜(p¯, y¯) ∩ V ⊂C˜(p¯+ tp′, y¯ + ty′) +Mt(||p′||2 + ||y′||2) 12BX ,
∀t ∈ (0, δ),∀p′ ∈ P, ||tp′|| ≤ δ,∀y′ ∈ Y, ||ty′|| ≤ δ. (25)
Since tn → 0 and (pn, yn) → (p, y), without loss of generality we may assume that
there exists M1 > 0 such that (||pn||2 + ||yn||2) 12 ≤ M1 and tn ∈ (0, δ), ||tnpn|| ≤
δ, ||tnyn|| ≤ δ, for all n. So, by (25), there exists {xn} ⊂ C˜(p¯ + tnpn, y¯ + tnyn) such
that ||x¯− xn|| ≤MM1tn, for all n. Set xˆn = xn−x¯tn . Then ||xˆn|| ≤MM1, for all n, and
xn = x¯+ tnxˆn ∈ C˜(p¯+ tnpn, y¯ + tnyn), ∀n. (26)

5 Application to Semi-Infinite Programming
In this section, we consider the problem (3) with the constraint mapping C : P ⇒ X
defined by
C(p) := {x ∈ X : gt(p, x) ≤ 0, t ∈ T}, (27)
where T is an arbitrary index set and for each t ∈ T, gt : P ×X → R is proper, lower
semicontinuous (l.s.c.) and convex.
It is well known that models of semi-infinite optimization cover, e.g., pollution con-
trol models, optimal experimental design in regression and the popular semi-definite
programming. Semi-infinite optimization programming and its wide applications have
attracted much attention from many researchers. We refer the reader to the book by
Goberna and Lo´pez [18] for more details and discussions and to some recent papers
[19, 20–24] for references.
Denote by R(T ) (respectively R(T )+ ) the collection of all the functions λ : T → R
taking nonzero (respectively nonnegative) values only at finitely many points of T,
and supp λ := {t ∈ T : λt 6= 0}. Given u ∈ R(T ) and λ ∈ R(T )+ , we put 〈λ, u〉 =∑
t∈supp λ λtut. The normal cone to a convex set Θ ⊂ X at x¯ ∈ Θ is defined by
N(Θ; x¯) := {v ∈ X : 〈v, x− x¯〉 ≤ 0, ∀x ∈ Θ}.
The polar cone of the Clarke tangent cone TC(Θ; x¯), denoted by NC(Θ; x¯), is called
the Clarke normal cone to Θ at x¯, i.e.,
NC(Θ; x¯) := TC(Θ; x¯)◦ = {v ∈ X : 〈v, x〉 ≤ 0, ∀x ∈ TC(Θ; x¯)}.
We denote by cone(Θ) the convex conical hull of Θ. The conjugate function ϕ∗ : X →
R to ϕ : X → R is defined by ϕ∗(v) := sup {〈v, x〉 − ϕ(x) : x ∈ X}.
In connection with (27), we use the set of active constraint multipliers defined by
A(p¯, x¯) := {λ ∈ R(T )+ : λtgt(p¯, x¯) = 0, ∀t ∈ supp λ}.
The following proposition gives us a criterion for computing the Clarke tangent
cone to the graph of the constraint mapping C at a given point.
Proposition 5.1 Let (p¯, x¯) ∈ gphC. Suppose that the following Farkas-Minkowski
constraint qualification (FM, see e.g. [24]) for (27) is satisfied, that is, the set
cone
(⋃
t∈T
epig∗t
)
is closed in P ×X × R. (28)
Then,
TC
(
gphC; (p¯, x¯)
)
=
{
(p, x) ∈ P ×X :
∑
t∈supp λ
λt∂gt(p¯, x¯)(p, x) ≤ 0, ∀λ ∈ A(p¯, x¯)
}
(29)
where the symbol ∂ stands for the subdifferential in the sense of convex analysis.
16
gt(p, x) = tp− tx1 − (1− t)x2, ∀x = (x1, x2) ∈ R2, ∀p ∈ R.
We consider the problem (3) with C defined in (27). By simply computing, one can
find
C(p) = {(x1, x2) ∈ R2 : x1 ≥ p, x2 ≥ 0},
F (p) = {y = (y1, y2) ∈ R2 : y1 ≥ 2p, y2 ≥ 0}, ∀p ∈ P.
Therefore, we observe that the domination property holds for F , ∀p ∈ P. Moreover,
for p¯ = 0,
C(p¯) = {(x1, x2) ∈ R2 : x1 ≥ 0, x2 ≥ 0},
F (p¯) = {(y1, y2) ∈ R2 : y1 ≥ 0, y2 ≥ 0},
and thus x¯ = (0, 0) ∈ C(p¯) as well as y¯ = f(p¯, x¯) = (0, 0) ∈ F(p¯). For each t ∈ T,
∀x = (x1, x2) ∈ R2, p ∈ R, we have
g∗t (p, x) =
{
0, if (p, x) = (t,−t, t− 1)
+∞, if (p, x) 6= (t,−t, t− 1),
epig∗t = {t} × {−t} × {t− 1} × R+,
and hence cone
(⋃
t∈T epig
∗
t
)
= R+ ×R2− ×R+ which is closed in R4. Using Proposi-
tion 5.1, we obtain
TC
(
gphC; (p¯, x¯)
)
=
{
(p, x) ∈ R× R2 : tp− tx1 − (1− t)x2 ≤ 0, ∀t ∈ T
}
.
Thus, for each p ∈ P,
{∇f(p¯, x¯)(p, x) : (p, x) ∈ TC(gphC; (p¯, x¯))}+R2+ = {(y1, y2) ∈ R2 : y1 ≥ 2p, y2 ≥ 0}.
Besides,
TC(epiF ; (p¯, y¯)) = {(p, y) ∈ R× R2 : y1 ≥ 2p, y2 ≥ 0}, ∀p ∈ P.
So, (32) is valid. Applying Theorem 5.1, we get
DCF(p¯, y¯)(p) = {(2p, 0)}, ∀p ∈ R.
