Abstract 
According to the related statistical data, elderly population is expending in our 
country. Driving behavior of the elderly has become an important issue to discuss. As 
their health, physical and mental conditions declined of the aging people, also did their 
driving safety. Instead of completely forbidding the elderly to drive, we ought to 
positively bring up the correct knowledge of driving to them, and increase their 
self-awareness of the driving conditions. 
The Driving Decisions Workbook (DDW, Eby et al, 2000a), a self-assessed 
instrument for aging people, could increase self-awareness and general knowledge of 
driving. This research introduced the DDW to elder drivers in Taiwan. We translated the 
DDW into Chinese, and discuss the translation with the users, medical experts, 
transportation experts and ergonomics experts, to build up the Chinese version of the 
DDW. 
The study mainly has three objectives. First, investigate Taiwanese elder drivers’ 
driving condition, driving habits and driving behavior. Second, discover the impact of 
impulsiveness-veturesomeness-empathy characteristics of the elder drivers on their 
driving behavior. Third, examine the effectiveness and usefulness of DDW. The subjects 
of the experiment are drivers over 65 ye0ars old in Taiwan. Data of personal 
characteristics, driving habits and driving behavior was selected through a questionnaire. 
For the DDW evaluation, subjects were asked to do a pretest, read the DDW and then do 
the posttest to see the difference between the pretest and the posttest of the evaluation 
questionnaire. 
The result showed that subjects with high impulsiveness level would have more 
driving errors, driving lapses and driving violations. By doing the statistical analysis, we 
concluded that DDW is indeed effective and useful for improving elder driving safety. 
Key words: elder people, Driving Decisions Workbook, driving behavior, driving 
safety, personality characteristics.

improve older people’s mobility. Researches of aging in the U.S. have concluded that 
besides the health problem, the biggest risk older people have to face is being isolated. 
For the elderly, owning driving licenses also represents their independence. 
However, the safety of older people’s driving is an issue worthy to discuss. 
According to the statistics of accident in the U.S., elder drivers had the higher rate 
involved in fatalities than most of the age groups (National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration [NHTSA], 2004). Similarly in Taiwan, in the data of accident 
involvement of the pass years, people over 65 years old had a fatality rate that was 
higher than for all other age groups (Lin and Lai, 2001b). Many researches have shown 
that the elevation in crash rate of older people is most likely linked to declining of 
vision, mobility, cognitive, reaction and other abilities related to driving. The sharp 
decline of these abilities affects the driving behavior of the elderly as well. 
According to the research of Eby et al. in 2003, they suggested that after 
completing DDW, most of the older people were more aware of the changes that could 
affect their driving. The responses of the DDW were correlated to the driving 
performance, moreover, DDW is helpful to evaluate the driving condition of elder 
drivers, and consequentially improve the traffic safety. 
On the other hand, researches had found that among personality characteristics, 
impulsiveness may be a critical factor that affects one’s driving behavior (Lawton et al. 
1997; Renner and Anderle, 2000). Owsley (2003) also examined the relation between 
impulsiveness-venturesomeness-empathy (hereafter IVE) and driving behavior, and 
suggested that these characteristics would affect elder drivers’ driving. 
Aging driving is common in the U.S. and other countries. Researches on driving 
exposure or driving behavior of elder drivers have done in these countries. In Taiwan, 
most of the drivers are young and middle aged adults, few statistic data of elder drivers 
has been collected. Therefore, problems of older driving are seldom discussed in 
Taiwan. However, this main population of the drivers in their middle ages will grow old. 
As the demographic trend of increasing aging population, researches on driving 
behavior and driving safety of the elderly in Taiwan are urgently needed. Therefore, 
this study aims at introducing DDW to Taiwan in order to help the elder drivers.

The experiment of the study took more than one hour for each subject, in order 
to complete the experiment, subjects of the study could not be chosen randomly. 
However, the completeness of the experiment process would apply more useful 
data of elder driving.

on an object to see it as clearly as they did at 20”, that is, it is a challenge for them 
reading road signs at night or finding unlit controls in the dark car. 
Compared to the young and middle aged drivers, it was found that elder drivers 
usually had shorter “legibility distance” or longer “legibility time”. In Schieber and 
Kline’s (1994) research, experiments were done to conclude that elder driver’s average 
legibility distance is always shorter, in the conditions of daytime, nighttime and 
“nighttime with glare”. Greene et al. (1994) also suggested that elder drivers had 
shorter legibility distance seeing all the traffic signs in the experiments both of the field 
study and the laboratory study. “Elder driver’s legibility distance were 65% those of the 
younger drivers. Age differences in the object detection task ranged from 20% to 45% 
reduction of the younger drivers”, Chrysler et al. (1996) concluded in their research. 
Those results may due to the decline of visual system or reaction of the elderly. 
Another obvious change of older people’s visual process is presbyopia, or loss of 
accommodation, which means one’s disability to see things close clearly (Yanik, 1989). 
It makes elder drivers moving their heads back and forth while driving to adjust the 
distance to read the display or control labels clearly. Furthermore, side vision reduces 
as people aged (Eby et al., 2000b). The decreased side vision may affect the ability of 
safe driving, and raise the chance of getting involved in an accident. Finally, yellow, 
orange and white are the colors that attract older people more and suitable for label 
colors, while blue is less attractive and may be excellent as a background color (Yanik, 
1989). 
In this section, we can conclude that changes of elder drivers’ visual condition 
might cause an effect on their driving. Therefore, as one aged, he should consult a 
doctor regularly to check if there is a visual problem, and make related changes when 
driving, for an example, avoiding driving at night. 
1.5.2 Reaction 
In the aspect of physiology, the definition of reaction time is the time between 
someone sees stimulations and makes an action to it (Committee of Traffic Safety 
Supervision, Ministry of Transportation and Communications [MOTC], R.O.C., 1994).  
8 
Changes and limits of elder drivers were reviewed in the previous sections. In the 
following section, some characters of elder driver’s driving habits and driving safety 
were discussed. 
1.6 Driving Habits and Driving Safety of the Elder Drivers 
Based on the statistics of traffic accidents in the U.S., elder drivers had the higher 
rate involved in fatalities than most of the age groups (National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration [NHTSA], 2004). Elder drivers’ crash rate per mile was twice that of 
middle-aged drivers, and as they involved in a crash, the chance they experience serious 
or fatal injury was three or four times of that of other age groups. Examined the vehicle 
crash data, the crash rate as well as mortality also increased among drivers aged 55 to 
70 (Kostyniuk and Shope, 2003). Similarly in Taiwan, the statistics of traffic accidents 
from 1987 to 2000 showed that people over 65 contributed the highest proportion to 
fatalities. (Lin and Lai, 2001a) 
Kostyniuk and Shope (2003) did a telephone survey on elder drivers in Michigan 
to check their reliance on private automobile and their plan for future mobility. The 
survey responses showed that most of the elder drivers hadn’t planned for driving 
cessation. “Over half the drivers who perceived a likelihood of driving problems within 
five years expected to keep driving beyond five years”, Kostyniuk and Shope 
concluded. 
The study of Hakamies-Blomqvist and Wahlström (1998) did mail survey and 
telephone interview to explore the driving habits of elder drivers in Finland. The result 
showed that there are more male older vehicle users than female. The essential reason 
elder drivers stop driving was the decline of health. Another reason was the stress they 
felt while driving, especially in certain situations such as at night or during rush hours. 
It was reported that elder drivers made fewer trips, drove fewer miles and drove 
less in certain situations, such as nighttime, in bad weather or during rush hours (Chu, 
1995). The main reasons elder drivers stopped driving are discomfort during driving, 
scruple of driving techniques or some health problems. Lyman et al. (2001) studied the 
relationship between factors as functional limitations, visual and cognitive functions 
10 
1. Vehicle drivers; 
2. Machine parts; 
3. Pedestrians and passengers; 
4. Traffic control and facilities; and 
5. Unexpected disaster. 
Based on the statistics of traffic accident in Taiwan from 1987 to 2000, the cause 
of those accidents related to “vehicle drivers” reached a proportion of 95%, takes the 
first place of the five factors. Among these accidents, the component factor “drivers” 
was the most serious, reached a proportion of 80%. The main reasons of the accidents 
were “ignoring to pay attention to the condition in front of the car” and “exceeding the 
speed limit and losing control of the speed”. Since 1993, the reason of “drunk driving” 
was becoming more serious (Lin and Lai, 2001a). 
Viewing the age distribution of death in traffic accidents (shown in Figure 2.2), for 
the passing years, people over 65 had the biggest proportion (Lin and Lai, 2001b). It 
could be concluded that older people are significantly in danger of getting seriously 
involved into traffic accidents. 
Tsai (2003) analyzed the reason of traffic accidents and regulation violation in his 
research. He discovered that traffic accidents strongly related to the driver’s behavior. 
Based on the definition of psychologists, violation behavior is caused by the changes of 
environmental attribute of a person, the changes of the real world condition and the 
cognition of behavior origin (Hou, 1982). Forming drivers’ habits to observe the law, 
placing importance on the education of traffic safety and having sane psychology 
characteristics are the essential factors to avoid driving violations. 
Tsai (2003) suggested that traffic safety can be improved through the following: 
1. Enhancing educations on drivers; 
2. Cumulating regulation penalty; 
3. Establishing driving morality; 
4. Training up for correct driving techniques; 
5. Giving the correct concept of road authority; 
12 
8. Enhancing the ability of handling the case; 
9. Carrying out the policy of “cars and motorcycles on the different lanes”; and 
10. Complete facilities for traffic safety. 
Researches suggested that education is an essential way to improve traffic safety. 
In Taiwan, most of the education on traffic safety is implemented on children or at 
school. There is seldom reeducation on traffic safety for elder drivers. 
1.8 Driving Assessments for Elder Drivers 
In the previous sections, the problem of elder drivers’ safety was discussed. Some 
of the ways to solve this problem are elder driver education or driving assessments. 
Educational intervention could make elder drivers avoid challenging driving situations, 
and increase their self-regulation and decrease their driving exposure (Owsley et al., 
2004). In Taiwan, seldom was planned in this category. This section is going to 
introduce some assessment plans in the United States. 
Assessment instruments for older driving include clinical assessments, on road 
tests, simulator-based tests and automatic psychophysical tests (Eby et al., 1998). One 
of the clinical assessment is a list named “SAFE DRIVE” that provides physicians to 
identify if the elder drivers should continue, curtail or stop driving (Wiseman and 
Souder, 1996). It recommends the physician: 
1. Review the person’s safety record from the state department of motor vehicles; 
2. Be on alert for signals of attention problems (patients who continually repeat 
questions or answers, lose track of conversation, appear quite confused); 
3. Obtain family observations of driving ability and behavior, including any self 
restrictions; 
4. Identify discrepancies between family/care-giving rating of driving ability and 
the patient’s self-rating; 
5. Screen for problematic alcohol use; 
6. Inquire about use of prescription and over-the-counter drugs associated with 
psychomotor impairment and driving problems; 
7. Test reaction time; 
 
14 
3.  Keeping updated on changes in driving and highway regulations; 
4.  Difficulty joining traffic on busy interstate highways; 
5.  Speed in reacting to dangerous driving situations; 
6.  Showing upset feelings in driving; 
7.  Wandering thought when driving; 
8.  Getting angry in traffic situations; 
9.  Getting regular eye checks for sharp vision; 
10. Checking with doctor/pharmacist about impact of medication on driving; 
11. Keeping updated on current health practices and habits; and  
12. Concern among family and friends about the person’s driving ability. 
The second section calculates the score for the survey and explains that if the 
driver can “go” or needs to “caution” or “stop” their driving. The third section is 
discussions of related safety tips and suggestions to help the elder drivers improving 
their driving performances. 
Older Driver Skill Assessment and Resource Guide: Creating Mobility Choices 
This 24-page guide is composed with self-assessment tests on reaction time, 
attention, vision, near-crash experiences and driving behavior (Eby et al., 1998). 
Intersperse the sections are educational statements to inform the elder drivers about tips 
for driving safety. 
Driving Decisions workbook (DDW, Eby et al., 2000a) is also a self-assessment 
instrument for elder drivers. “The intent of developing a new self-assessment 
instrument, …, was to improve upon exiting instruments”, expressed Eby et al.. In the 
next section, the development and research of DDW would be introduced in detail. 
1.9 Development and Research of DDW 
This section introduces the development and structure of DDW (Eby et al., 2000a), 
and review the applied research of DDW. The objectives of DDW are the following

1.11 Research Propositions and Hypotheses 
The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship among personality 
characteristics, self-assessment and driving behavior of the elder drivers in Taiwan. 
Base on the purpose, the propositions and hypotheses are offered as following: 
Proposition 1 Elder drivers’ personality characteristics have significant influence on 
driving. 
H1-1: Different level on impulsiveness characteristics has significant influence 
on driving behavior. 
H1-2: Different level on venturesomeness characteristics has significant 
influence on driving behavior. 
H1-3: Different level on empathy characteristics has significant influence on 
driving behavior. 
Proposition 2 Self-assessment has significant influence on improving driving safety of 
the elder drivers. 
H2-1: Self-assessment has significant influence on general knowledge, 
information, awareness and the subjects’ future plans about their health 
conditions related to driving. 
H2-2: Self-assessment has significant influence on information or concept about 
elder drivers’ driving abilities and subjects’ future plans on taking some 
assessment tests. 
H2-3: Self-assessment has significant influence on self-reported driving condition 
and future plan about driving. 
1.12 Subjects 
The subjects in this study were elder drivers in Taiwan. The requirements of the 
subjects are listed below: 
1. Over 65 years old; 
2. Has a valid driver’s license; and

avoid the subjects’ impatience at first, the 61-item IVE test is put in the second part of 
the questionnaire. The following sections would describe the content of the 
questionnaire. 
The questionnaire of this part includes mainly four parts, subject profiles, IVE 
personality characteristics test, driving habits and driving behavior. Besides the profile 
part, the design of other tree parts of the questionnaire is described as following. 
1.14.2.1 Questions of Driving Habits 
Questions to collect drivers’ driving habits came from two sources. Some were 
adopted from the Driving Habits Questionnaire (DHQ, Owsley, et al., 1999) and others 
from the research of Lyman et al. in 2001. There are 14 questions in this part, included: 
1. Average days, trips and places traveled per week; 
2. Self-reported quality of driving; 
3. Driving speed compared with the general flow of traffic; and  
4. Difficulty of driving with certain driving situations: at night, in the rain, while 
along, on the freeway, with children, during rush hours, when change lanes, 
when making left hand turns at interactions, and parallel parking. 
1.14.2.2 Driving Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ) 
The 24-questione DBQ (Lawten et al., 1997) was used to check the driving 
behavior of elder drivers. Questions in DBQ could be classified to subgroups of errors, 
lapses and violations. Responses to each question, based on the frequency, are 
measured on a 6-point scale from 1=never to 6=nearly all the time. 
1.14.2.3 IVE Characteristics Questionnaire 
In this part, the IVE questionnaire developed by Eysenck and Eysenck is used. 
After deleting 2 questions that couldn’t be clearly classified into one of the IVE 
dimensions, there are 61 yes/no questions to score the impulsiveness, venturesome- 
ness and empathy characteristics of the subjects. 
24 
personality characteristics and their driving behavior of errors, lapses and 
violations, and to see if different level of impulsiveness, venturesomeness and 
empathy has significant impact on the elder drivers’ driving behavior. 
1.15 DDW Evaluation 
This part is mainly an experiment to examine the effectiveness of DDW. The 
implement procedure, materials and analysis methods used in this part would be 
described in this section. 
1.15.1 Procedure 
Figure 3.4 shows the implement procedure of the examination experiment on the 
effectiveness of DDW. First, the pretest of the evaluation questions was administered. 
After completing the questions, the subjects were told to read the DDW. There was no 
time limit for them to read it. Finally, the posttest of the evaluation questions would be 
done after reading the DDW. ANOVA test was used to examine the difference of the 
answers to the evaluation questions before and after reading DDW. Descriptive 
statistics analysis was also used to see the subjective opinions of the subjects on the

The development and researches about DDW was introduced in section 2.5. There 
are five sections in the DDW, as following: 
1. On the Road: This part examines driving experiences of the elderly. There are 
eight sets of questions in this part, including driving in unfamiliar areas, 
driving at night, driving in bad weather, driving in heavy traffic and some other 
driving condition of the elderly.  
2. Seeing: This part examine the vision problem of the elder drivers. There are 
seven sets of questions in this part, including glare recovery, eyesight, sensitive 
to light and depth perception.  
3. Thinking: There are four question sets in this part, including the examination 
of divided attention, selective attention, speed of decision making and memory.

65-69 (66%) and 70-74 (28%). Most of them were males, which make up 86% of the 
subjects. Subjects come from many parts of Taiwan, 4 (8%) of them lives in the north 
part of Taiwan (Taipei), 13 (26%) in the middle part (Taichung, Yunlin, Nantou and 
Changhua), 21 (42%) in the south part (Tianan, ChiaYi and Kaohsiung) and 12 (24%) 
in the east (Yilan and Hualien). 
1.17 Driving Habits 
The driving habits data of the 50 subjects are listed in Table 4.2, including their 
driving frequency (days per week, trips per weed, and places per week) and driving 
difficulty of specific situations.

In the part of “driving exposure”, the subjects averagely drive 3.6 days in a week. 
Thirteen of them drive less than 1 day in a week, while 38 of the 50 subjects still drive 
4-7 days in a week. The average number of trips they make in a week is 8.04, and they 
averagely travel to 4.01 places per week. Most of the subjects make 1-5 trips in a week 
(with a proportion of 40%), and travels to about 3-4 places (with a proportion of 40%). 
The “driving condition” part shows that most of the elder drivers’ self reported driving 
quality is average (with a proportion of 40%), and none of the subject regard 
themselves drive poorly. 
As for the driving difficulty, the common driving situations subjects reported 
difficult with are driving in the rain (40%), driving during rush hours (34%), parallel 
parking (32%) and driving at night (30%). The least commonly situations subjects 
reported difficulty with are changing lanes (8%) and making left hand turns at 
interactions (8%). 18 out of the 50 subjects (36%) experience a high level of driving 
difficulty by reporting three or more of these driving situations. 
1.18 IVE Personality Characteristics and Driving Behavior 
In section 3.7.1, the calculation of DBQ scores and IVE level were being 
introduced. ANOVA was used in this section to find the impact of the subjects IVE 
characteristics level on their error, lapse and violation scores of DBQ. 
1.18.1 IVE versus Error Score  
This part of the analysis tests if subjects of different level of IVE characteristics 
had different error scores significantly. We did the one way ANOVA with the 3 factors 
of impulsiveness, ventursomeness and empathy, each factor has two levels, “high” and 
“low”. The set of this part is as Table 4.3. 
Table 4.4 shows the ANOVA result. The only factor that has significant effect on 
error score is impulsiveness, with the p-value of 0.021.

1.18.2 IVE versus Lapse Score 
This part of the analysis tests that if different level of IVE characteristics will have 
significant impact on the lapse score in DBQ. We did the one way ANOVA with the 3 
factors of impulsiveness, ventursomeness and empathy, each factor has two levels, 
“high” and “low”. The set of this part is shown as Table 4.6. 
In Table 4.7, the ANOVA result shows that the factor impulsiveness has 
significant effect on the lapse score of DBQ, with the p-value of 0.023. 
Comparing the mean lapse scores of the two groups with “high” and “low” 
impulsiveness level, we find out that drivers with high level of impulsiveness tend to 
have higher lapse scores. The comparison is shown as Table 4.8. Therefore, the 
conclusion of this part of the analysis is that impulsive person might have more 
driving lapse.

impulsiveness level, we find out that drivers with high level of impulsiveness also tend 
to have higher violation scores. The comparison of this part is shown as Table 4.11. It 
could be concluded that impulsive person might have more driving violation. 
1.18.4 IVE versus DBQ Score 
This part of the analysis tests that if different level of IVE characteristics will have 
significant impact on the total score in DBQ. We did the one way ANOVA with the 3 
factors of impulsiveness, ventursomeness and empathy, each factor has two levels, 
“high” and “low”. The set of this part is shown as Table 4.12. In Table 4.13, the 
ANOVA result shows that only the factor impulsiveness has significant effect on the 
total score of DBQ, with the p-value of 0.005. 
Comparing the total DBQ scores of the two groups with “high” and “low” 
impulsiveness level, we find out that drivers with high level of impulsiveness tend to 
have higher DBQ scores. Table 4.14 shows the comparison. The conclusion of this part 
of the analysis is that impulsive person significantly has higher scores on DBQ test.

1.19.1 Reliability Analysis of the DDW Evaluation Questionnaire 
Since the evaluation questionnaire was developed by this study, we checked the 
internal consistency of the questionnaire by Cronbach’s α coefficient. It was suggested 
that α coefficient greater than 0.7 is high reliable while less than 0.35 is low reliable, 
which should be rejected. 
The Cronbach’s α of both the pretest and the posttest of the evaluation 
questionnaire are 0.7818 and 0.8208. The Cronbach’s α values shows the questionnaire 
should be reliable. Although deleting some of the questions may increase the 
Cronbach’s α value, the improvement was not significant (the Cronbach’s α values only 
increased by 0.2 or so). Therefore, we chose to remain all the questions, and in order to 
keep the complement of the questionnaire. 
1.19.2 Paired t-test of the DDW Evaluation Questionnaire 
The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the DDW. 
Therefore, the evaluation questionnaire was administered before and after reading the 
DDW to see if the subject had different answers on these questions. Paired t-test was 
used to test the significant of difference between the answers of the pretest and the 
posttest, as Table 4.15. 
The paired t-test shows that for most of the questions, there is a significant 
difference between the pretest and posttest answers of the subjects. From the frequency 
of the answer type we can conclude that most of the subject would have an 
improvement on their thinking or understanding of elder driving. However, there was 
only slightly significant difference (with the p-value = 0.057) between the pretest and 
posttest answers of the question “Is the medicine you are taking now affects your 
driving?” Table 4.16 shows the frequency of the pre-post answers of this question. 
From Table 4.16 we find out that most (74%) of the subjects had “no” on both 
pretest and posttest of question18. It might because that these subjects really hadn’t 
taken a medicine that would affect their driving. Still, 16% of the subjects were aware 
that the medicine they took might cause an effect on their driving after reading DDW. 
42 
Table 0.16 Frequency of the Pre-post Answers of Evaluation Question18

Yes Yes  3  6% 
Yes No  2  4%

No No  0  0% 
 
This section discussed the effectiveness of the DDW. According to the analysis, 
we could conclude that the DDW could improve subjects’ thinking and understanding 
about elder driving significantly. In the next section, subjective opinions of the subjects 
on DDW would be discussed. 
1.19.3 Subjective Opinion on DDW 
The evaluation questionnaire administered after reading the DDW includes 10 
subjective questions adopted from the research of Eby et al. in 2003. The questions 
include 6 yes/no questions to assess whether the DDW increases self-awareness and 
general knowledge of the elder drivers or not. Percentages of the subjects answering 
“yes” to each question overall and by sex and age group are shown in Table 4.18. 
According to Table 4.18, most (more than 90%) of the subjects answered “yes” to 
question 1 to 5, and about three fourths of the subjects answered “yes” to question 6. 
The lower agreement to question 6 might because of subjects’ confidence of their own 
health and ability. There’s no significant difference between the answers of different 
sex or age groups.

the workbook?

This chapter analyzed the data and discussed the results of the study. For the 
impact of elder drivers’ personal characteristics on driving behavior, subjects with high 
impulsiveness level tended to have higher scores on errors, lapses and violations of the 
DBQ than those with lower impulsiveness level. On the other hand, the analyses of 
DDW evaluation show that DDW could improve subjects’ thinking and understanding 
about elder driving significantly. The next chapter would compare the result with other 
researches, make the conclusion and suggestions.  
46 
that they commit driving errors and violations are more impulsive; this study also 
explored the same conclusion. 
1.20.3 DDW Evaluation 
In the part of DDW evaluation, this study developed 22 evaluation questions to 
test the changes of subjects’ thoughts after reading DDW. The answers of the pretest 
and posttest to 20 of these 22 questions showed that there was a significant 
improvement on the subjects’ thoughts or plans on driving related problems. The 
insignificant 2 questions are “is the medicine you are taking now affects your driving?” 
and “Did you/Will you do exercise or play sports?” According to the data, we find out 
that the reason of the previous question might be that subjects really hadn’t taken a 
medicine that would affect their driving. Still, some of the subjects were aware that the 
medicine they took might cause an effect on their driving after reading DDW. The later 
one is because that most of the subjects already took exercises in their lives, therefore, 
although their answer was “yes” after reading DDW, it doesn’t make a change. 
For the subjective opinions on the usefulness of the DDW, the responses showed 
that most of the subjects regard DDW useful. The answers of this part are about the 
same as those of the research by Eby et al. in 2003. Moreover, female elder drivers tend 
to rate the DDW more useful than male elder drivers. From the results, we could 
conclude that DDW is an effective and useful instrument for the elder drivers to 
evaluate their driving, and moreover improved the driving safety of the elderly. 
1.21 Suggestions 
After discussing the results of the study, there are some suggestion for the 
transportation and motor vehicle organizations, as well as for future studies. 
1.21.1 Suggestions for Transportation and Motor Vehicle Organizations 
The suggestions for the transportation and motor vehicle organizations are the 
following: 
1. Providing more information of elder driving to the elder drivers in Taiwan: 
48 
scores of the elder drivers in Taiwan. Some researches had suggested that crash 
involvement of the elder drivers (or of other age groups) is correlated to their 
driving habits, the DBQ scores or their IVE personalities. If the data of crash 
involvement was available, the relation between IVE, DBQ and driving habits 
of the elder drivers in Taiwan and their crash involvement may be examined in 
the future.
