where x  and y  are nondimensionalized 
coordinates defined by Lxx /=  and Hyy /= . 
L and H, denotes respectively, the length and width 
of the flapping wings. The coefficients 
fedcba ,,,,,  defining the surface variation of the 
lift will be determined through a well trained 
artificial neural network (ANN). To provide a well 
trained ANN, in this research we prepare the 
training pattern through the finite element 
modeling. In this modeling the flapping wings are 
analyzed by using the commercial finite element 
code ANSYS. The SHELL91 and SHELL99 
elements are selected to model the wing skins and 
skeletons. The skins are made by LD-PE plastics 
and the skeletons are made by Carbon/Epoxy 
prepregs. Mapped mesh and free mesh are used in 
modeling. The wings are fixed at the connection 
points of wings and flapping mechanism. The 
convergence analysis is performed to make sure 
the correctness of the output values. In this 
network the input vector contains the strain values 
of three different positions of the wings, while the 
output vector contains the coefficients of equation 
(18). To make sure the ANN is well trained, test 
patterns are prepared through both numerical 
modeling and experimental measurement. After 
ANN is well trained, the lift acting on the flapping 
wings can then be estimated through the strains 
measured on the wings. Figure 5 shows the 
mechanism of the flapping wings and three 
positions for the strain measurement. Figures 6a-c 
show the lift estimated by ANN and measured 
strains associated with three different flapping 
frequencies.

Keywords: aeroelasticity, divergence, tapered composite wing. 
Summary. Divergence of wing structures is an important topic in aeroelasticity. Recently a comprehensive wing 
model considering the airfoil shape was established. In this paper, this model was extended to discuss the 
tapered composite wing. By employing the Hamilton’s principle and following the standard procedure of finite 
element formulation, an elementwise comprehensive model was developed. In this model, the force vector 
containing the lift and moment of the wings was approximated by the aerodynamic strip theory, which will then 
lead to a standard eigen-relation for solving the divergence dynamic pressure. 
 
1 INTRODUCTION 
The fundamental work concerning the divergence instability of swept metallic wings was done about fifty 
years ago. It was shown that bending deflections have a destabilizing effect on the swept-forward wings. Hence 
the swept-forward wing aircraft as a possible option was completely eliminated for a long time, until the 
aeroelastic tailoring concept for the composite wing structures was raised and studied by Krone [1]. Following 
his work, many different approaches and considerations have been studied such as the classical beam model, the 
coupled bending-torsion model, and the refined models taking warping restraint, transverse shear deformation, 
shell bending strain, and cross-sectional materials and geometries into account. All these results support that a 
composite swept-forward wing can be tailored to overcome this adverse instability phenomenon. 
Due to the complexity, most of the analytical models consider the composite wings with box cross section and 
uniform spans. Recently, a comprehensive model considering the shape of airfoil for composite wing structures 
was developed by our co-workers [2,3]. This model can treat the more realistic wing structures such as stiffened 
multicell wings that are composed of the laminated skins, stringers, ribs, and spars. However, no matter how 
comprehensive the model is, it is restricted to the cases of the wings with uniform spans. For the most common 
tapered composite wings, as far as we know no research about the aeroelastic divergence has been presented. To 
study the tapered effect and to enhance the comprehensive model, in this paper the concept of finite element 
formulation is embedded to the comprehensive model to improve its generality and efficiency. 
2 PROBLEM STATEMENTS 
If the cover skin of the wing is made of composite laminates, the entire wing structure may be simulated as a 
composite sandwich plate [4,5] in which the wing skins, stringers, and spar flanges are simulated as the faces 
resisting the in-plane force and bending moment; furthermore, the spar webs and ribs are simulated as the core 
resisting the transverse shear force. Because the wing cross section must have a streamline shape commonly 
referred to as an airfoil section, the thickness of the sandwich will not be a constant but a function of the airfoil. 
Moreover, as the usual sandwich assumptions, the thickness is not too small to neglect the transverse shear 
deformation. Based upon these considerations, a matrix form comprehensive model was developed [3]. In this 
model, the equations of motion, constitutive law and boundary conditions can be expressed as follows:
