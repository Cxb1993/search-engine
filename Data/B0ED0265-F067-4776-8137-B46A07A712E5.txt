Abstract 
 
The problem for two bonded functionally graded piezoelectric/piezo- magnetic 
half planes is studied in this project. An internal crack, which is normal to the 
interface, is located within one of the two half planes. The crack surfaces are 
subjected to the antiplane mechanical, inplane electrical and magnetic loads. The 
material properties of the functionally graded piezoelectric/piezo- magnetic material 
are assumed in exponential forms and vary along the crack direction. By using the 
Fourier transform, the problem can be reduced to a system of singular integral 
equations and solved numerically by using Gauss-Chebyshev integration technique. 
The stress, electric displacement and magnetic induction intensity factors are then 
obtained from the near crack tip field solution of the magneto-electro-mechanical 
field. In this project, the effects of crack lengths, location of crack and 
nonhomogeneous parameters of the material will be discussed. 
Keywords: functionally graded materials, antiplane crack, singular integral equation

Since the crack is permeable, the electric field Ey and magnetic field Hy are 
continuous across the crack surface and have no singularities at crack tips. Therefore, 
the corresponding electric field intensity factors  and magnetic field intensity 
factor  become zero. From the constitutive equations (1), D
Ek3
Hk3 y and By must be 
singular at the crack tips since γyz is singular. The corresponding electric displacement 
intensity factors  and magnetic induction intensity factor  are not zero and 
depend on the material constants e
Dk3
Bk3
15 and q15, respectively. 
When the piezoelectric constant e15 and the piezomagnetic coefficient q15 
become zero, the results of this study can be reduced to case of functionally graded 
elastic material [8]. 
 
4. Results and discussion 
In the following calculations, the material properties of BaTiO3 and CoFe2O4 
listed in Table 1 [23] are used as the base material at x = 0. 
The materials BaTiO3 (inclusion) and CoFe2O4 (matrix) are mixed to form a 
composite material. The effective material properties of the composite material ΦC 
can be obtained by using the following macroscopic mixture rule [24]: 
)1( f

IC VV −Φ+Φ=Φ            (39) 
whereΦI and ΦM are the material properties of inclusion and matrix, respectively. Vf is 
the volume fraction of inclusions. In this project, 50% volume fraction of BaTiO3 
inclusion is assumed at the boundary edge x = 0. 
It should be noted that the negative value of µ0 for CoFe2O4 in Table 1 is 
questionable. According to the handbook [25], the magnetic permeability of 
ferrimagnetic materials such as CoFe2O4 should be positive. Pan [26] also pointed out 
that negative µ0 will result in a negative internal energy and the Stroh formulation 
cannot be applied. Due to the lack of material data in the past references, we assign an 
arbitrary value to µ0 for CoFe2O4, say 100×10-6  Ns2/ C2 in the following calculations.

This study can be categorized into several simple problems depending the

The effects of the nonhomogeneous material 2 on the magneto-electro-elastic field are 
dominated by the kernel k2. 
Fig. 4 plots the variations of the normalized intensity factors at crack tips with 
β2a0 at different values of c/a0 when a0 is kept as a constant. When β2 > 0, the 
material properties of material 2 are weaker than those of material 1. It is expected 
that the normalized intensity factors at crack tip a are greater than those at crack tip b 
when β2 > 0 and vise versa. As the crack move away further from the boundary 
surface (e.g. c/a0 = 6), the normalized intensity factors at both crack tips approach 
same values. If β2 = 0, the problem becomes a crack within the homogeneous 
piezoelectric/piezomagnetic infinite plane. The normalized intensity factors at both 
crack tips are equal to 1. 
4.4 Problem D: β2 ＝ 0 
When material parameter β2 is equal to zero, the problem becomes an internal 
crack within the FGPPM half plane bonded to a homogeneous piezoelectric/ 
piezomagnetic half plane. The kernel k2 in equations (22) should be replaced by:

The effects of the homogeneous material 2 on the magneto-electro-elastic field are 
dominated by the kernel k2. 
Fig. 5 plots the variations of the normalized intensity factors at crack tips with 
β1a0 at different values of c/a0 when a0 is kept as a constant. It shows that greater 
normalized intensity factors occur at the crack tip with stronger material properties.  
4.5 Problem E: β1 ＝ β2 
When material parameters β1 and β2 are equal, the problem becomes an internal 
crack within a FGPPM infinite plane. The kernel k2 in equations (22) vanishes. The 
magneto-electro-elastic field is independent on the crack position c/a0. 
Fig. 6 plots the variations of the normalized intensity factors at crack tips with 
β1a0 (or β2a0) when a0 is kept as a constant. The distribution of the factors looks like 
the English letter X. It clearly shows that larger factors occur at the crack tip with 
stronger material. 
4.6 Problem F: β1 ≠ β2 ≠ 0 
Finally, the most general case that the materials 1 and 2 are two different 
functionally graded piezoelectric/ piezomagnetic materials. Fig. 7 plots the variations 
of the normalized intensity factors at crack tips with β1a0 at different values of β2/β1 
when c/a0 = 1.5. In general, the results show that greater normalized intensity factors 
occur at the crack tip with stronger material properties. Two other results are (1) For 
β1 > 0, the factors increase as β2/β1 increases; and (2) For β1 < 0, the factors increase

GRADED PIEZOELECTRIC/PIEZOMAGNETIC MATERIALS

Introduction 
 
In the early 1970s, the piezoelectric/piezomagnetic 
composite material such as BaTiO3-CoFe2O4 was 
produced. They have strong magneto-electro-elastic 
coupling effect [1-3]. Due to the capability of the 
conversion between mechanical, electric and 
magnetic energy, they are extensively used to design 
electrical packaging, actuators, sensors and other 
electronic products. These complex structures often 
involve many different materials. When subjected to 
mechanical, electric and magnetic loads, these 
products can fail prematurely due to internal defects, 
such as cracks, voids and inclusions. 
The concept of functionally graded materials (FGMs) 
and functionally graded piezoelectric materials 
(FGPMs) with continuous material properties has 
been raised and applied in the mechanical, electrical, 
thermal, nuclear, optical and medical fields [4, 5]. In 
recent year, functionally graded piezoelectric/ 
piezomagnetic materials (FGPPMs) [5] have been 
developed to improve the reliability of piezoelectric/ 
piezomagnetic materials and structures. 
In this study, the antiplane problem of an internal 
impermeable crack normal to the interface of two 
bonded FGPPMs is investigated. The material 
properties, such as elastic modulus, piezoelectric 
constant, dielectric constant, piezomagnetic 
coefficient, magnetoelectric coefficient and the 
magnetic permeability, are assumed in exponential 
forms along the crack direction. A system of singular 
integral equations is derived by using the Fourier 
transform and solved numerically by using 
Gauss-Chebyshev integration technique. The stress, 
electric displacement and magnetic induction 
intensity factors at the crack tips are obtained. The 
energy density theory is applied to study the effects 
of nonhomogeneous material parameter β1 and 
β2 and crack position on the fracture behavior. 
 
Formulation of the problem 
 
Consider an internal crack of length 2a0 = b-a 
normal to the interface of two perfect bonded 
functionally graded piezoelectric/piezomagnetic 
materials (Fig. 1). The center of crack is at x = c. 
Since the piezoelectric/piezomagnetic materials are 
polarized in the z-direction, the antiplane elastic 
field is coupled with the inplane electric and 
magnetic fields. The constitutive equations for 
piezoelectric/piezomagnetic materials can be written 
as:
