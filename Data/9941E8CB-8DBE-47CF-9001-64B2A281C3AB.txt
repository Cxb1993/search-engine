Abstract 
   Following the massive outbreak of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in early 
2003, the drainage system in high-rise residential buildings has become a major concern. This 
study proposes a simple risk analysis tool for the probable infection due to a contaminated 
drainage stack in residential high-rise buildings in some Asian cities. The methodology would 
follow the conception of FMEA (Failure Mode Effection Analysis). In particular, key risk factors 
including connections between appliance and stack, the plumbing system, ventilation, equipment 
life and maintenance were surveyed and used to evaluate the overall risk associated in some 
high-rise residential buildings with Monte-Carlo simulations. With the proposed tool, regional 
risks of infection due to the building drainage systems were estimated, regarding to the city 
building age and height profiles. The results showed that a city with high-rise environment would 
associate a higher spreading risk due to the drainage system. The assessment system would be 
practical and sensible for evaluating the infection risk in building drainage systems for both 
existing buildings and new construction where system design was already been specified.

interaction between falling water and air. According to the traction of falling water and air, the 
drainage stack produces negative pressure in upper floors that pulls seal water in the trap to 
balance the air pressure in pipe. Due to the hydraulic jump in stack base, the falling water 
forms a water curtain and pushes air back to the lower floor drains to liberate the pressure. 
Generally, a drain trap is constructed with a minimum depth of 50 mm seal water. Accordingly, 
any overload of air pressure in the stack can cause depletion of seal water in a trap. In other 
words, improper design of a drainage system can introduce an infection risk on the upper 
floor facilities as well as the lower floors of a building, especially in high-rise residential 
buildings. 
The profile of air pressure distribution in the drainage stack is now understood from 
previous research [7-9, 16]. Probably, the increasing building height promotes pressure 
fluctuations in the drainage stack. Consequently, inappropriate drainage system design is 
likely to cause trouble in sanitary facilities and also serious problems in high-rise residential 
buildings. The drainage system design process involves a series of decision-making 
operations [9]. Disaggregating the system of the design process allows an understanding of 
the framework upon which these decisions are made. Two functional categories, namely, 
‘drain’ and ‘vent’ are shown in Fig. 4 that the drain components includes ‘Drain System’, 
‘Zoning Method’, and ‘Connection Method’; while the vent components consists of ‘Stack 
Vent’, ‘Yoke Vent’, ‘Loop Vent’, and ’Terminal Vent’. This initial classification of the 
drainage system in buildings is fundamental to forming a holistic profile for the risk 
assessment methodology used within this research. 
3. Infection risk model 
Risk evaluation is a general tool used comprehensively in commercial projects or for 
other purposes. Herein, the infection risk of the drainage system in residential buildings is 
mainly based on the principle of Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA) [11]. FMEA is a 
systematized technique which identifies and ranks the potential failure conditions in the 
drainage system, i.e. the probable inflection, in order to prioritize remedial treatment for the 
system and facilities. System evaluation relies upon an expert’s determination of relative 
weighting coefficients. By using the FMEA concept, problems in the drainage system design 
can be detected. According to a systematic case study investigation in Taiwan, fundamental 
categories of this evaluation system for the domestic drainage system were identified. The 
influencing factors were determined from schematic observation and empirical experimental 
results performed previously [8,9,15-17]. The assessment procedure allocates these factors a 
weighting based on their performance in each part of the holistic profile. The weighting 
coefficient is determined by addressing the severity, occurrence, and detection on FMEA. The 
result will be the multiple of each factor’s weighting coefficient which would show the 
performance ranking. This process can also identify the faults of drainage system for 
preventive maintenance and remedial purposes. 
This paper does not only use the failure mode to classify the evaluation of drainage but 
 5
instrument used for pressure measurement of a floor drain is shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. In the 
test, a static pressure up to 20 Pa was applied to the floor drain; a fully functioned floor was 
indicated by the static pressure sustained for 10 minutes. Follow-up test on the static pressure 
would be repeated for the refilled failure floor drain in order to identify the probable cause of 
water depletion, such as poor maintained or improper installation.   
There are seven terminal appliances would contribute to the failure factor T, namely, 
water closets t1, urinal t2, basin t3, bidet t4, floor drain t5, mop basin t6, and terminal appliance 
not in used t7. With the trap weighting coefficient shown in Table 1, the risk factor for all the 
terminal appliances ti of the drainage system is determined by,

3.2 Path (plumbing) P 
The second influencing factor proposed in this study related to the probable infection 
path in a building drainage system. According to the consideration of pressure fluctuation 
control of building drainage system, single-pipe system for lower floors and the double-pipe 
system for higher floor in Taiwan [16]. On the other hand, in order to satisfy the building 
regulations, the sanitary drainage system is complied to set the general waste water and feces 
sewer to be dependent and separately in all building designs. Equation 3 below accounted for 
the path of a drainage system forming by the pipe system, the vent system and the terminal 
connection method. With the weighting coefficients shown in Table 2, the path factor is 
expressed by,

3.3 Space and environment (Ventilation) I 
The third influencing factor is the surroundings of the sanitation environment, regarding 
the room ventilation condition. Typical residential buildings would be designed with a 
‘light-well’ for promoting natural ventilation and mechanical exhaust fan(s) would be 
installed in washrooms. The room ventilation would be given by either the natural ventilation 
or the mechanical ventilation. An excessive mechanical extraction from a washroom would 
introduce additional pressure on a water seal and hence the probable infection. 
Air-conditioned environment with poor ventilation would also contribute to the infection risk. 
In this study, an indoor space with an open window to outdoor would be classified as naturally 
ventilated space. Herein, the current Green Building assessment tool regarding the ventilation 
evaluation of Interior Index in Taiwan was adopted. It depends on the ratio of mechanical 
control area and natural design floor area, thus it can take the weighting value [18]. Indeed, 
the mechanical ventilation with auxiliary fresh air intake might reduce the partial weighting, 
otherwise infection risk increased. Table 3 shows the weighting coefficients for the factor of 
the ventilation condition; the factor is given by,  
 7
impression to the survey sample showed an average environment regarding the infection risk. 
The average risk level was moderate. A negative skewed distribution of the risk levels with a 
median of 3.9 would indicate a moderate risk in the surveyed samples. A total of 20 samples 
got risk level 3-5 and also ranked as ‘Moderate risk’, which reasonably described the 
impression and the assessment might be a useful tool for the infection risk assessment of 
building drainage systems. It was found that, for the samples with a risk level of “High” or 
risk value above 7, which could evidently be aware of marsh gas in around by olfaction 
during the assessment. That situation was validated by a practical case which is a new 
construction with 16 floors height and surveyed in this research.  
It was reported that, from the survey, 73.3% of floors drains were not set up properly or 
mechanically damaged which was a common problem for those buildings with age over 15 
years. It could be caused by the improper maintenance of the drainage system and 
post-occupied renovations, where the connection of floor drain to the drainage system was not 
considered properly. Concerning the ventilation in the building environment, 60% used 
auxiliary mechanical ventilation. A poor ventilated environment would cause stagnant air 
which might increase the dissemination risk. It was justified that, with the drainage system 
life cycle consideration, the risk factor weighting influence might be less significant and the 
dissemination risk regarding this influence would also be less significant.  
From the risk level, the drainage system in the sample building associated with a higher 
chance to get infection would be identified and immediate improvements must be provided 
for those buildings. Fig. 12 shows the average values of the four risk factors T, P, I, U for the 
survey samples. Distributions of the subcomponents were needed for the Monte-Carlo 
simulations. The infection risk of the surveyed samples was shown in Fig. 13. Apparently, 
contaminants dissemination could happen in all kinds of buildings regardless of building floor 
or equipment life cycle, and it was found that the main causative factors are floor drains and 
ventilation. As over 21 years equipment provided that well function terminal appliance and 
positive ventilation, the risk value goes lower. Otherwise, it will lead to an extremely high 
infection risk factor.  
4.1 Regional infection risk  
In this study, the surveyed distributions of each weighting coefficients in the four risk 
factors were used to estimate the regional infection risk due to the building drainage systems. 
In particular, the overall risk levels isR
~
 in this region were evaluated by Eq. 1, with the 
weighting coefficient φi sampled from the surveyed distribution i
~φ  using Monte-Carlo 
sampling technique, i.e. ii
~φ∈φ . A Simple Monte-Carlo Simulation (SMS) procedure was 
adopted with the number of simulations were set at an arbitrary error limit of 2% for each 
coefficient [20,21]. Fig. 14 shows relative errors ε of the simulated risk factors ζ* = T, P, I, U 
and the infection risk level ζ* = Ris.

Introduction 
 
The performance of drainage system was concerned with our life and healthy. In 
pervious study, the steady flow would affect the air pressure in stack system. But the 
influence of lower volume closet could not predict efficiently. In this study, we would 
set an indestructible testing mechanism and processes of drainage System, so that 
clarify the fluctuation of air pressure in stack system. And it would be compared and 
analyzed with primary prediction. 
 
Fig 1-research flow path 
 
2. Reviews and schematic structure of drainage system 
It was reported that there were various forms of drainage system in previous research. 
But in the experimental tower of NTUST, we only could operate with general building 
in practice , it only could be the forecast prototypes. The reference pointed out that it 
could be quantities the threshold limit value of air pressure in stack system by the 
Steady flow experiment. However, the origins of discharge load in practical cases were 
due mostly to normal closet and lower volume closet in the drainage system. It could 
not be identified the threshold limit value and just be predicted preliminary. In practical 
situation, we could not break or bore the construction for the reason of measure .This 
study would set an indestructible testing facility and procedure, and be referred in the 
further research.

3. Analysis of crucial components  
The indestructible testing facility included pressure sensor, data receiver and amplifier, 
data logger, power supply equipment and pressure hose. The testing procedure would 
include two parts, one was for the operating on the experimental tower, and the other 
was on normal sampling cases. In the procedure of experimental tower and site testing, 
it would include three parts, examination on air tightness of the instrument, Correct the 
data of the instrument, and others preparing.
