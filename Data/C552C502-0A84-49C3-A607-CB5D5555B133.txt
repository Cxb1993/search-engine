2following an unreliable production system,
Raz et al. 5 propose an economic off-line
inspection model for a finite batch size.
Three different policies: cost minimizing,
perfect information and zero-defects are
emphasized in their model. The case of
product inspection errors exist is considered
by Sheu et al. 6 However, there are many
flaws in Sheu et al.’s 6 model. Therefore, in
this paper, we reformulate the economic
inspection/disposition model for the off-line
quality control problem with two types of
inspection errors.
2. Results and conclusions
This study extends Raz et al.’s5
economic off-line quality control policy to
consider two types of inspection errors
which usually exists in practice. The impact
of the two types inspection errors on the
optimal IDE policy and the two types of
inspection errors are investigated with three
types of inspection policies: economic
optimization, zero-defects and perfect
information, and these results are
summarized numerical examples. Numerical
examples tell us that when inspection errors
are not negligible, it is impossible to spend a
reasonable cost to reach perfect information
policy. That is, perfect information policy is
not feasible when inspection errors exist.
However, the economic optimization and
zero-defects policies are still applicable.
Also, several mistakes occur in Sheu et
al.’s 6 model have been corrected. As a
conclusion, we have the following
observations.
(1) The threshold batch size (TBS) is
increases when process reliability
increases.
(2) Sheu et al.’s 6 TBS is always under
estimated.
(3) For fixed process failure rate, the TBS is
non-decreasing when inspection errors
increase. This is because larger
inspection errors make inspection
decline.
(4) For fixed inspection errors  and ,
when a process failure rate Ap1 has a
  0TBS Ap , we have
   BA pp TBSTBS  for BA pp  .
This is because a larger failure rate
makes inspection decline.
