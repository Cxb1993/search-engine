2. THEORETICAL REVIEWS 
The discharge of an appliance into a vertical drainage stack is a complex phenomenon which 
may consist of triple phase flow incorporating solid, liquid and air. The mechanism of flow in a 
vertical drainage stack is schematically illustrated by a single-pipe system and a double-pipe 
system as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively

According to the vertical stack flow phenomenon reported in theoretical reviews 
[11]
, the 
drainage stack air pressure profile may be divided into four zones, shown in Figure 3. However, 
the air pressure distribution which reveals the time average air pressure data with steady flow 
conditions does not involve air pressure fluctuations of instantaneous discharge in the vertical 
drainage flow. Therefore, more practical investigation and exploration in this area is necessary.  
Trap seal water in a drainage system acts as an integral part of a hygiene system in existing 
residential buildings, and provides an essential component in order to minimize the possible 
infection risk due to the transmission of contaminants and to safeguard occupied space from 
stench and vermin from the drainage network. The air pressure in the drainpipe will fluctuate 
with the flow of wastewater. According to previous research, flowing wastewater tends to 
generate negative pressures in the drainage system one or two stories below the discharge floor, 
which can pull the water seal out of the trap. However, at the main horizontal drainpipe or the 
system one or two stories above, its influence will cause positive pressure and may push the 
water seal out of trap. Both of those mechanisms can lead to depletion of the water seal.

Hence, this study integrates all the testing equipment using a portable device which can 
carry out the testing purpose in existing drainage systems .The equipment consists of a pressure 
sensor, data receiver and amplifier, data logger, power supply equipment and pressure hose as 
shown in figure 7.And the process of field measurement was divided into two steps. First, one 
end of the pressure hose was fitted to the air pressure sensor and the other end was put into the 
W.C, making sure it passed through the water trap. Once installed the data logger was set to 
receive data as shown in figure 8.

This paper will systematically show the comparison between single pipe and double pipe 
system in pattern-1 and Pattern-5. The maximum positive pressure is related to the pipe system. 
Figure 11 shows the situation when W.C.5 is discharged from floors 1 to 5 simultaneously for the 
single pipe system. The result shows a single pipe system in which pattern-5 represents the 
discharge from the 8th to the 12th floor, and shows the maximum negative pressure would occur 
because of large drainage load. The maximum positive pressure tends to increase among 
discharge floors. The drainage load was less in pattern-1 because the discharge floor was only 
one floor.

the normal working hour day between 0700-1845.  
The selection of monitoring locations were very likely to associate with the maximum peak 
negative and positive pressures at the system predicted with a mathematic model for steady 
discharge flow rate 
[6]
 .In this study, the washrooms were not restricted for normal use and 
therefore discharge flow rates were typical for a high-rise office building at normal discharging 
rates.

6. RESULTS AND DISCUSSUIN 
The experimental results of the characteristics of air pressure fluctuation were presented in 
terms of the mean pressure   (m wg.) of 1-s, standard deviation of pressure  (m wg.), average 
peak pressure p (m wg.) of 1-s and average fluctuation frequency  (Hz) of 1-s and range of 1-s 
values in every 5-min measured at a normalized stack height 
'
pH  of the in-use drainage stack are 
shown in Figures 14 and 15. Determined by the stack height Hs (=78m), height of pressure 
measurement Hp (=0.25m and 57.9m), the normalized heights 
'
pH  are 0.003 and 0.742 given 
below,

Figure 14 shows the air fluctuation frequencies in time 0800-1830 were between 20Hz to 
40Hz at H'p= 0.742 and between 10Hz to 40Hz at H'p=0.003; the corresponding average 
frequencies at the two levels were 36Hz (SD=3Hz) and 31Hz (SD=4.7Hz) respectively. The 
measured frequency was significantly lower at location (B) (p<0.0001, t-test). It was noted that 
the 5-min average pressure fluctuation frequencies were higher than the measured frequencies at 
the similar normalized stack heights (H'p=0.789 and 0.08) in a stack discharging at steady flow 
rates of 1Ls−1 to 4Ls−1 (5Hz to 30Hz at H'p=0.789 and 20Hz at H'p<0.1) (p<0.01, t-test) [16].

Interestingly, there were local peaks during the office hours, i.e. time 1035, 1500, 1635, 
which the peaks occurred at a time about 1.5 hours after the last occurrence of peak pressure. 
This pattern related to the collective WC demands of office occupants and the mean time 
between 2 consecutive WC flushes by office occupants would be 1.5h, which had no significant 
difference from a surveyed value of 1.4-2.1 hours (p>0.1, t-test) 
[18]
.  
The pressure variations in this study is compared with a previous study of pressure 
variations in a 38m high drainage stack of a full-scale experimental tower (denoted as ‘tower 
stack’ below) under steady flow conditions of flow rates 1Ls−1 to 4Ls−1 discharging at a height 
between 15m to 33m above the stack base 
[10]
. The comparison would identify the differences of 
pressure variation characteristics between the stacks under steady and unsteady flow conditions. 
Table 2 summarized the characteristics of air pressure variations in this study, with air pressures 
measured at the 2 heights of the full-scale experimental tower shown for reference. Compared 
with the 1-s values, this study reported that a higher standard deviation of pressures as a fraction 
of the average pressure as compared with those measured in the steady flow conditions.

It was also noted that the office stack in this study was ventilated by a 100 mm diameter pipe, 
at lengths from open air at roof top to measurement locations A and B were about 20m and 78m 
respectively. A ventilation pipe would be used to limit the maximum pressures along a 
discharging stack. Assume all ventilation air supplied from open air at the roof top through the 
ventilation pipe system, the maximum pressure gradients at locations A and B were 11Pam−1 
and 6.5Pam−1, corresponding to airflows of 70Ls−1 and 52Ls−1 in a 100mm diameter 
ventilation pipe as estimated by the Darcy and Colebrook equation shown below, where p' 
(Pam−1) is the pressure gradient, fL is dimensionless friction factor, Dh (mm) is the hydraulic 
diameter a and va are the density and velocity of fluid respectively,

Figure 16 shows the coefficient a1 and the corresponding probability of excessive pressure 
p in each 5-min period at measurement locations A and B. The results showed the probable 
trend of a1 (p<0.05, t-test) against the monitoring time period. The values were determined from 
a short monitoring period of 1-s and from a longer monitoring period of 5-min were shown in 
Table 1 for illustration. However, no significant trend of a1 was found during the office hours 
0900-1830 (p>0.1, t-test), the results also showed that a1 can be approximated by normal 
distributions (p>0.1, Chi-square test) and values a1 at the 2 measurement locations in each 1-s 
and 5-min periods were shown in Table 1. It was reported that the 1-s a1 at the office stack would 
be different from the one measured at the tower stack (p0.0001, t-test) but no significant 
difference for the 5-min value was reported (p>0.05, t-test). No significant differences between 
the probabilities for the office stack and the tower stack were reported (p≥0.05, t-test), except a 
case reported with probable difference (p=0.03, t-test).

It was reported that the FB and NMSE values for the regression model given by Equation (9) 
were −2.6% and 0.4% for a1=2.8 at 1-s period, and 12% and 1.8% for a1=3.7 at 5-min period, 
respectively. As all values of FB and NMSE were below 5%, the model was considered 
engineeringly acceptable at a shorter time period. A coarse monitoring period of 5-min might 
associate a larger error; the errors were mainly due to the poor predictions within a low peak 
pressure range (0.01 m wg.) when the usage rate was low at time 0800. 
Validity of the regression model was performed with additional pressure readings (<0.01 m 
wg.≤|p|≤0.25 m wg.) obtained at the both measurement locations from the same stack at a 
period 0800-0830 and the results are shown in Figure 18 (symbol ○). Significant correlations 
between the predicted peaks measured peaks were reported for the 1-s period (R>0.99, p0.0001, 
t-test) and the 5-min period (R≥0.88, p0.0001, t-test) respectively. The corresponding FB and 
NMSE values were within −2% and 0.7% for 1-s period, and −40% and 46% for 5-min period. 
As expected, a coarse monitoring period of 5-min might associate a larger error.  
Predictions made by a model derived for steady flow conditions at the experimental tower 
stack 
[16]
 were shown for comparison. The model with the constants obtained from steady flow 
experiments would over predict the peak pressures in the office stack with unsteady discharge 
flow rates. Using the correlations for the 1-s period, this study predicted peak pressures 15% less 
than the ones made by the expressions derived in the previous experimental study. It was noted 
that higher air pressure fluctuation values were reported for a discharging stack with unsteady 
flow rates. The application of the constant a1 derived from steady flow conditions accounted for 
lower air pressure fluctuation values was therefore over-predict the peak pressure in this study.

Abstract 
Due to the importance of permit flow rate regulation which is adopted in many countries, the 
terminal velocity in drainage stack was seen as one of the crucial issues in building drainage studies. 
Several theories and predictions were reported in previous researches from 1960s. An empirical 
study on terminal water velocity of drainage stack was explored from 1996 and reported in 2008 
CIBW62 conference HK. However, the validation issues were remained and need to be further 
clarified. This paper would continue the methodology with empirical approach by theoretical study 
from air pressure distribution mechanism. Meanwhile, a technology with digital high-speed video 
camera and statistic tool will be used to validate the calculation result of terminal velocity of 
drainage stack in this research. The results confirm that the theoretical study can fit the practical 
sense and the validation also can response the calculation results. Accordingly, the terminal velocity 
of drainage stack should be reconfirmed and redefined its accurate value under the new validation 
evidences. Furthermore, the long term regulation and application which is according to the lower 
terminal velocity and permit flow rate also need to be reconsidered.

terminal velocity, gravity acceleration, high-speed video camera, statistic methodology 
 
2. Theoretical Reviews 
The theory of the annulated flowing in drainage stack was first reported by Wyly2) in 1960s. 
Afterward, some researches tried to figure out the velocity of flowing water in stack by the 
experimental method and theory, however, no firm results were reported in that period. In 1980s, 
Tukagoshi6) conducted electricity to the salt solution in Japan, and put the sensor of the electricity 
into the pipe which perpendicular to the pipe’s section and divided into 1-25 points as observational 
points, when salt solution flowing into the vertical stack and pass through the sensor would 
evaluated the velocity and quantity of the water flowing. In 1994, Sakaue7) in Japan continuously 
infused water into vertical stack for testing the velocity of the water flowing, and to return to 
original equation for evaluated the water flowing rate in the vertical stack. However, all these 
researches have not reached a clarified and validated conclusion on the terminal velocity of 
drainage stack.  
According to the previous researches8)9)10) on air pressure distribution, the airflow rate (Qa) was 
identified as a critical parameter for a prediction model which can approximately figure out the 
falling water phenomenon in vertical drainage stack. The mechanism of flowing phenomenon 
within vertical drainage stack is now schematically understood. Air pressure in vertical drainage 
stack is caused by series interactions between downstream water and through-flow air in vertical 
pipe. Fig.1 illustrates the image of flow state and the modified interaction, thus it conducts the main 
parameters with air pressure, airflow rate, and resistance coefficients, and they are the essential 
factors for prediction model of air pressure distribution in vertical drainage stack. These researches 
also provided the possible viewpoint to explore the flowing velocity of air and water in drainage 
stack. Consequently, the innovative study on terminal velocity was restarted from 1996. Afterward, 
an initial study results with empirical approach was reported in 2008 CIBW62 conference HK. 
However, the validation issues were remained and need to be further clarified. 
CIBW62 conference HK11), an initial experiment was executed to validate the theoretical terminal 
velocity. The further precise verification process is necessary to be conducted in this research. Due 
to the phenomenon of falling water in stack is complex and random by time sequence, the 
improvement of accuracy is a crucial part for the reliability of validation.  
In order to improve the reliability of validation results, a statistic methodology of sampling 
conception for random observation is adopted in this report. The same as our previous report last 
year, Table 1 is the specification of this digital high-speed video camera which is used to observe 
the falling water velocity in stack. Fig.2 is the picture of experiment in observation place which 
shows the circumstance and condition of the operation.

According to the statistic conception for the sampling process, at least 385 observation samples are 
necessary for the accuracy of calculation under 95% reliable level and 5% permit inaccuracy. 
Therefore, 129 observation samples are picked from individual part of these three water features 
and totally 387 samples are taken into the calculation for one observation point.  
In order to catch the individual sample of water, clear black lines are set by 10 mm interval on the 
screen picture to trace the moving of falling water. Accordingly, the velocity of each sample can be 
calculated by the moving distance and time interval. The calculations include average velocity and 
deviation for three water features. Fig.5 shows the process flow and details of sampling method. We 
used the grid meshes to specify the water sample and trace its moving velocity. Fig.6 shows a case 
of the different time location which we pick 25 and 26 recognizable samples for tracing their 
moving behaviors. All the velocity of the recognizable water drops can be exactly calculated by its 
moving distance and time intervals for each observation point in experiment tower.   
As the above mentioned about experiment device, the discharge water is from 12th floor height, and 
three observation points are set in each floor area. Accordingly, there are totally 32 observation 
points and 12 384 selected samples for calculation in this empirical validation study.

average velocity for each observation point and the simultaneous air pressure distribution in stack. 
It is seen that the terminal velocity approximately happen in C zone of the air pressure distribution. 
That also matches the theoretical conception and the initial assumption of this research. Namely, the 
results can validate the accurate terminal velocity of drainage stack by this empirical approach. 
 
 
4. Validation and discussion   
The previous report in 2008 CIBW62 conference introduced an empirical methodology to calculate 
the terminal velocity in drainage stack. The calculation process and results are summarized in 
Chapter 2. On the other hand, the terminal velocity is concluded from the observation by high-speed 
video camera and statistic sampling process in chapter 3. The comparison of the results from the 
different approach is show in Table 2 and Fig. 15. It reveals that the results of individual water flow 
rate (1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 l/s) are approximately closed and validation is reliable. We also compare 
the positions of maxima air pressure by calculation and observation. The position of maxima air 
pressure is expressed by the distance from discharge floor. The results are shown in Table 2. It also 
reveals that the range is approximately matched for the two approaches.

It is obviously that the major reason for the different terminal velocity between present research and 
previous documents is the calculation assumption. Wyly and Dowson’s researches assumed that 
water flow in stack is similar to the open channel with annual membrane flow in stack and adopted 
the Manning equation to estimate the terminal velocity. However, the visual observation 
significantly shows that the real flow in drainage stack is more complex and dynamic than annual 
flow assumption.  
Meanwhile, according to the visual observation and the calculated velocity in this research, it is 
noticed that even the annual flow along the stack has greater value than previous researches. Fig.17 
shows the comparison of the annual flow velocity. Namely, the terminal velocity in drainage stack 
should be reconfirmed nowadays and need to redefine its accurate value under the new validation 
results. Furthermore, the long term regulation and application which is according to the lower 
terminal velocity and permit flow rate are also necessary to be reconsidered.
