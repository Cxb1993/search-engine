for the Volterra kernels and random multisine signals [13]
as the input [14].
In this project, we propose a computationally efficient
method for estimation of cubically nonlinear channels us-
ing random multisine signals as the input. By using the
properties of the higher-order moment spectra of the ran-
dom multisine signal, we show that a simple algorithm for
estimating the complex-valued Volterra kernels of the non-
linear channel can be obtained. This algorithm requires
neither estimating various higher-order moment spectra of
the input nor calculating an inverse matrix. Compared to
the conventional method, the proposed algorithm reduces
the required computation from O(L3) to O(L), where L is
the total number of coefficients. Furthermore, it is shown
that, by properly designing the random multisine input
signal, the optimum MMSE estimates of the Volterra ker-
nels can be obtained by the proposed method.
2 Bandpass Nonlinear Channel
A typical example of a bandpass nonlinear channel is
a communication transmitter, where its power amplifier
(PA) is nonlinear and operating at the radio frequency
(RF) range [15]. A simple configuration of a power am-
plifier in a communication system is shown in Fig. 1 [16],
where x˜(t) and z˜(t) are the bandpass input and output sig-
nals of the PA, respectively. The bandpass output signal
of the zonal filter is denoted by y˜(t).
The input signal x˜(t) can be written as
x˜(t) = u(t) cos(2pifct+ θ(t)) (1)
where u(t) and θ(t) are the real-valued amplitude and
phase functions, respectively, and fc is the carrier fre-
quency. The output signal of the zonal filter can be writ-
ten as
y˜(t) = v(t) cos(2pifct+ ψ(t)) (2)
where the amplitude and phase functions v(t) and ψ(t)
are also real valued.
2.1 Baseband Equivalent Model
The baseband equivalent model of the bandpass system in
Fig. 1 is shown in Fig. 2 [16], where the baseband equiva-
y(t)x(t)

system in Fig. 1.
lent input and output signals are defined as
x(t) = u(t)ejθ(t) (3)
y(t) = v(t)ejψ(t) (4)
Note that x(t) and y(t) are in general complex-valued sig-
nals. They are related by [17]:
y(t) =
K∑
k=0

i=1
x(t− τi)
2k+1∏
j=k+2
x∗(t− τj)dτ1dτ2 · · ·dτ2k+1(5)
Note that the baseband Volterra kernels are in general
complex valued. Furthermore, only odd-order Volterra
kernels are involved in (5). This is due to the fact that
even-order Volterra kernels do not generate in-band sig-
nals [17].
One can take the Fourier transform of (5) to obtain its
frequency-domain representation. Following the frequecy-
domain representation, the discrete, frequency-domain,
baseband equivalent Volterra model for a cubically non-
linear channel can be written as:
Y (m) = H(m)X(m)
+
∑
−M≤i,j,k≤M
(i+j+k=m)
H3(i, j, k)X(i)X(j)X
∗(−k)
+ε(m), (6)
where X(·) and Y (·) are the discrete Fourier transforms
(DFTs) of the input and output, respectively. The lin-
ear Volterra kernel (LVK) and the cubic Volterra kernel
(CVK) are denoted by H1(·) and H3(·, ·, ·), respectively.
ε(m) denotes the modeling error, and M is the maximum
discrete frequency of X(·) with a non-zero value.
2.2 The MMSE Estimates of the
Frequency-Domain Volterra Ker-
nels
The estimation region for H3(i, j, k) in the 3-D (i, j, k)
space is a cube, as shown in Fig. 3. Since Y (m) includes
contributions from those H3(i, j, k)’s which satisfy i+ j+
2
where A(l) = |A(l)|ejφl . Note that the x(t) in (18) is a
complex-valued signal.
The Fourier transform of x(t), say, X(f), is equal to
X(f) =
L∑
l=−L
A(l)δ(f − lf0) (19)
Let X(m) be the discrete-frequency counterpart of X(f)
at f = mf0 (m an integer), then we see from (19) that
X(m) = A(m). Note that the spectral resolution is deter-
mined by f0.
3.2 Higher-Order Auto-Moment Spectra
of a Random Multisine Signal
When the input signal is a random multisine, the second-
order auto-moment spectrum of the input is:
E[X∗(i)X(j)] = E[|A(i)||A(j)|]E[ejφie−jφj ]
=
{
µ2, i = j
0 i 6= j
, i, j = −L, . . . , L (20)
where µ2 = E[|A(i)|
2]. In deriving (20), we have used (17)
and the fact that A(i), A(j), φi, and φj are independent
for i 6= j. The 3rd-order auto-moment spectrum of the
input is:
E[X∗(i)X(j)X(k)] = E[|A(i)||A(j)||A(k)|]
·E[e−jφiejφjejφk ]
= 0, i, j, k = −L, . . . , L (21)
where again the independence properties have been used
in deriving (21). Note that (21) is equal to zero even when
i = j = k, this is due to the fact that E[e−jφiejφiejφi ] =
E[ejφi ] = 0. Based on the result of (21), it is straightfor-
ward to see that all odd-order auto-moment spectra of the
input are also equal to zero. In particular, we have
E[X∗(i)X∗(j)X(k)X(l)X(m)] = 0 (22)
Similarly, for the 4-th order auto-moment spectrum of the
input, we have
E[X∗(i)X∗(j)X(k)X(l)] =


µ4, i = j = k = l
µ22, i = k 6= j = l
0, otherwise
,
i, j, k, l = −L, . . . , L (23)
where µ4 = E[|A(i)|
4] and it is understood that i and j
(and also k and l) are interchangeable. For the 6-th order
auto-moment spectrum of the input, we have
E[X∗(i)X∗(j)X∗(k)X(l)X(m)X(n)] =

µ6, i = j = k = l = m = n

0, otherwise

where µ6 = E[|A(i)|
6] and it is understood that i j, and
k (and also l, m, and n) are interchangeable.
Using (20)-(24), we see that, when the input is a ran-
dom multisine signal, most elements of the auto-moment
spectra matrix E[X∗(m)XT (m)] are actually zero. There-
fore, the matrix becomes a sparse matrix. This makes a
simple algorithm for solving the Volterra kernels possible.
3.3 Solving the Volterra Kernels
By substituting (13) and (14) into the normal equation
(15), one obtains
[
E[X∗X ] E[X∗XT3 ]
E[X∗3X ] E[X
∗
3X
T

] [
H
H3
]
=
[
E[X∗Y ]
E[X∗3Y ]
]
(25)
where the frequency indexes are omitted in (25) for nota-
tional simplicity.
Equation (25) can be solved by breaking it into two sets
of equations, where each set corresponds to one particular
row of (25). Due to the sparseness of the various matri-
ces, each set of equations can further be decomposed into
individual equations with a similar form. These individ-
ual equations can then be solved with ease. The resulting
solution is shown in Table 1. The detail of the derivation
is omitted for the conciseness of this paper.

above design guarantees that the resulting input signal
satisfies (17) exactly. In this case, the NMSEs of the esti-
mated total, linear, quadratic, and cubic Volterra kernels
are shown in Table 3 (denoted by RMI2). For compari-
son, the NMSEs achieved by the GRI method using the
same input and output signals are also shown in Table 3
(denoted by GRI2). We see that the NMSEs achieved by
the RMI2 and the GRI2 methods are exactly the same.
The estimated LVK by the RMI2 method is compared to
the actual LVK in Fig. 7. These comparisons suggest that
excellent estimates (which are the MMSE solution) were
obtained by the RMI2 method.
5 Conclusion
A simple algorithm for identifying the Volterra kernels
of a bandpass nonlinear channel using random multisine
signals as the input is presented. By analyzing the higher-
order moment spectra of the random multisine input, we
show that kernel identification can be achieved without
estimation of various higher-order moment spectra of the
input and calculation of an inverse matrix. Compared
to the conventional method, the proposed method dra-
matically reduces the required computational complexity.
Meanwhile, we present a technique for designing random
multisine signals which quarantee the attainment of
the optimum MMSE solution. Therefore, the proposed
method indeed serves as a simple and accurate method
for estimating the Volterra kernels of bandpass nonlinear
channels. Volterra model based nonlinear equalizers can
benefit from the proposed method.
