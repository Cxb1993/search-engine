responsible for the sharp decrease at the low 
current. In addition, we have also explored and 
compared the low-temperature EL properties of 
InGaN/GaN nanorod arrays with planar LEDs. Finally, 
the effects of strains and defects on the Internal 
Quantum Efficiency (IQE) of nanorod LEDs with 
different etching depth were studied. The results 
indicate that a shorter nanorod etching depth is 
preferred for a higher light output. However, the 
longer nanorod structure has a less severe droop 
effect and a higher operating current, which may 
eventually lead to higher optical output if the 
defects can be properly suppressed.

2. Literature review 
 
Despite numerous research works on nanowire/nanorod synthesis, only a limited 
number of groups reported fabrication and characterizations on the nanorod LED arrays 
[5-10]. The critical issue of nanorod LED fabrication is to prevent shorting the p- and 
n-type semiconductors when depositing the top metal contact. In addition, for most 
nanorod arrays, the leakage current is inevitable and the device fails before light 
emission as the junction temperature becomes too high. There have been several 
solutions proposed, including the insertion of spin-on glass (SOG) [5] or polymer (such 
as SU-8) as the space layer [6], the usage of oblique indium tin oxide (ITO) deposition 
[7], and the photo-enhanced chemical (PEC) wet oxidation process of GaN nanorod 
sidewalls [8] to achieve nanorod devices. Some reported the reduction of the reverse 
bias current to μA range [5,8,10]. The optical power of GaN based nanorod arrays is as 
high as 3700mW/cm
2 
at the injection current of 20mA (corresponding to the current 
density of 22.22A/cm
2
) [7]. Despite the report of light emission from nanorod arrays, a 
reliable manufacturing process with high production yield and excellent performance 
isn’t available. The current-voltage curves of such nanodevices suggest that they suffer 
from large leakage currents, large ideality factors, and low optical output power, as 
compared with conventional planar GaN based LEDs. 
 
In this report, the technology of nanosphere lithography was applied to fabricate 
nanorod arrays. By spin-coating a monolayer of nanospheres on top of the GaN based 
LED epi-structure, and followed by semiconductor etching, the InGaN/GaN nanorod 
structure was realized. With PECVD grown SiO2 sidewall passivation, the leakage 
current can be significantly reduced. Furthermore, we performed a chemical 
mechanical polishing (CMP) technique to achieve uniform exposure of p-type GaN 
nanorod tips on the sample. The electrical and optical properties were characterized. 
We demonstrated a nanorod LED array with high optical output power and a low 
ideality factor.

of junction temperature, EQE of nanorod device was extracted at both DC (100% duty 
cycle) and pulsed (1% duty cycle with the cycle period of 50ms) currents. The 
normalized EQE vs. injection current for both bias conditions are plotted in Fig. 5. 
Basically, the heating effect can be mitigated at the 1% duty cycle. The EQE curve at 
1% duty cycle shows a nearly constant decreasing trend (with the slope －6.45x10-3 
(A/cm2)
-1
), which is close to that of the 100% duty cycle case at the high current level 
(slope= －7.69 x10-3 (A/cm2)-1). As we compared both cases, the rapid EQE decrease 
between 1.6 and 8A/cm2 (slope= －8.3 x10-2(A/cm2)-1) in Fig. 4 is mainly associated 
with the thermal effect, while the decrease beyond 8A/cm
2 
is related to other factors.  
 
Moreover, the far field radiation profile of nanorod LED array is demonstrated in 
Fig. 6. The angle at half maximum intensity, θ1/2, occurs at 30°, suggesting that the far 
field pattern is a Lambertian profile. Since the Lambertian emission refers to a source 
emitting the same quality of light in all directions, it indicates that the nanorod LED 
array is mainly consisted of point light sources with excellent uniformity. 
 
In addition, we have also explored and compared the low-temperature EL 
properties of InGaN/GaN nanorod arrays with planar LEDs at an injection current 
ranges from 2 to 20 mA. As shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, it is found that the optical 
output of a nanorod LED array increases by 55.4% when the temperature drops from 
300 to 190 K, while there is only a 4.9% increase to the maximum output power at 
220 K for a planar LED. We believe that the increase can be mainly attributed to the 
suppressed nonradiative recombination. Also, due to a better spatial overlap of 
electrons and holes in the quantum wells, carriers can be more efficiently recombined 
in the nanorod device at low temperature. Furthermore, as the temperature drops 
below 190 K, the optical intensity shows a monotonical decrease for both the planar 
and nanorod devices, which is mainly associated with carrier overflow to the GaN 
cladding layers and to the frozen Mg+ dopant in the p-GaN layer. Next, as depicted in 
Fig. 9, the nanorods show nearly constant peak energy in the EL spectra at various 
injection currents at 300 K, while a blue shift from 2.75 to 2.78 eV has been observed 
at 190 K. The results suggest that with the increased number of carriers in the 
quantum wells (less non-radiative recombination), carrier screening and band filling 
still prevail in the partial strain relaxed nanorods. Moreover, when the temperature 
drops to 77 K, the blue shift of both nanorod and planar devices disappears as there 
are fewer carriers in the quantum wells for radiative recombination.
