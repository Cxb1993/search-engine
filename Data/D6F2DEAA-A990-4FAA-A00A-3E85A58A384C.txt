2Abstract
The delay elements of a conventional two-dimensional space-time receiver are fixed. The rather
inflexible design is inappropriate since the received signals among the antenna branches are
correlated due to limited spacing, and the fading environment is time-varying. In this report we
propose a dynamic finger assignment strategy for a space-time receiver, where the delay taps are
adjusted dynamically, based on the theory of finite projective planes, to improve the
signal-to-noise ratio in correlated antenna branches. The proposed finger assignment scheme
maximizes the collected energy by dynamically setting the tap delays depending on the correlation
among antenna branches and the delay spread of the channel. In the performance evaluation, we
demonstrate that the proposed finger assignment scheme can improve the signal-to-noise ratio
significantly in comparison to the conventional mesh-grid configuration when the correlation
among antenna branches is high and the channel dispersion is relatively long in comparison to the
overall span of the fingers, assuming that the channel model is Nakagami. However, the gain is
moderate if the channel dispersion ratio is short, where the gain of the gain of reduced correlation
among antenna branches must compensate for the reduced signal-to-noise ratio due to the missed
signals.

branches. The technique of dynamically setting the tap delays reduces the correlation among
antenna branches with a minimal increase of the overall span of tap delays. The 2D Rake can
switch between two different modes, the proposed configuration and the mesh-grid configuration
to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio. The reasons for setting the tap delays dynamically are as
follows. First, the effectiveness of antenna diversity is based on the assumption that the correlation
among antenna branches is low. It has been shown in [15,16,23] that space-time receivers in
highly correlated Rayleigh and Nakagami fading channels suffer a significant degradation.
Secondly, the delay spread can vary because of changing geographical conditions, and signal
arrival directions. If the span of the fingers in the time axis is too long for the delay spread, some
fingers may not capture signals. The finger assignment scheme proposed in this report is based on
the theory of finite projective planes [17]. Our focus is on the reduction of antenna correlation
through dynamically adjustment of the delay taps with a minimal increase of overall span of delay
taps, referred to as tap interleaving. While tap interleaving may reduce the correlation among
antenna branches, it also increases the overall span of tap delays. Because the span of tap delays is
increased minimally, the probability that some fingers may not capture signals is reduced to the
minimum for a channel with a cluster of energy.
This report is organized as follows. In Section 2, we delineate the configuration of the
proposed space-time receiver. In Section 3, we prove that the proposed scheme is optimal in terms
of reducing the correlation among antenna branches with minimal increase of overall span of tap
delays. In Section 4, the proposed configuration is compared with the conventional mesh-grid in
terms of the probability density function of the signal-to-noise ratio and the cumulative
distribution function of signal-to-noise ratio. Further remarks and a conclusion are given in
Sections 5 and 6, respectively.
6Figure 1: The Conventional Mesh-grid Space-time Receiver ( )1, mN
In Figure 1, each antenna diversity has 1m adjustable delay elements to provide RAKE
diversity up to 1m degree. Initially, all the delay elements in the first column are set to 0, and
the delay elements in other columns are set to 1 unit, which is equal to the inverse of the signal
bandwidth )(W , that is )/1( W .
For the conventional space-time receiver, the spatial fading correlation between a pair of
antenna branches can be high for two reasons. First, the increasing number of antenna branches
being packed into the limited spatial dimension of the receiver increases the correlation among
antenna branches. Secondly, the fingers of one branch completely overlap in time with the fingers
of other branches as in the mesh-grid configuration. The effect of spatial fading correlation on the
performance of diversity receiver systems has been presented in the work by Salz and Winters
[23,24], where the spatial fading correlation is a function of angle of arrival, space between
antenna elements, and antenna configurations [23]. If we set the delay between fingers equal to the
inverse of the signal bandwidth, the time correlation between fingers of delays cannot exist. For
(spatially) correlated antenna branches, we are mainly concerned how the changes of antenna
configurations affect the spatially fading correlation. To be more precise in this report, we are

8that the spatial fading correlation between two antenna branches is an increasing function of the
number of overlapped taps between two antenna branches. Further ignoring the compound
effects with the spatial dimension and the angle spread, we can assume that the spatial correlation
is proportional to the number of overlapped fingers between two antenna branches.
Let pqkj , denotes the spatial fading correlation between the p th finger of antenna branch
k and the q th finger of antenna branch j with delay times at and bt , respectively. We have
sjlik  , (as defined in equation (3)) if ba tt  , and 0, jlik if ba tt  . The latter is true
because the difference in delay times causes independent signal fading. The spatial fading
correlation between antenna branch k and antenna branch j , kj , can be determined based on
pqkj , , in Appendix I.
If the space between a pair of antenna branches cannot be increased to reduce correlation, it is
better to interleave the fingers of the antenna branches in time domain. When adjusting tap delays
for interleaving, the overall span of tap delays needs to be minimized especially for a channel with
a cluster of energy as in IEEE UWB channel modes [26]. The constraint is needed to maximize the
probability that a finger can capture signals. We have found a method, based on the theory of finite
projective planes, to minimize the degradation of correlation on the effectiveness of antenna
diversity with minimal increase of overall span of tap delays, and thus, the possibility that some
tap may not capture signals is reduced.
2.1 The Finite Projective Planes
A Finite projective plane of N points has the following properties.
1. A Finite projective plane of N points consists of N sets of points. We define an index set
 N  1| such that   :A is the collection of N sets of points for the
corresponding Finite projective plane of N points.
2. Each set of the Finite projective plane has exactly m+1 points, where Nmm  12 . In terms

corresponding to the set numbers. For example, the delay elements of the seventh antenna
branch are determined based on the set of points (3, 5, 6). The first delay element is
determined by (1): 1d = 13 2 ; The second delay element is calculated by substituting 1d
into (2): 41521 dd  22 d ; The third delay element is calculated in a similar way

Figure 2: The Configuration of the Proposed Space-time Receiver
In general, the values of the delay elements are determined such that the temporal
locations of the fingers for an antenna branch correspond to the point numbers of the set assigned
to that antenna branch. The only difference between mesh-grid configuration and the proposed
configuration is the delay setting of the delay elements. All other parameters such as the number of
12
branches and channel dispersion ratio. When the correlation among antenna branches is greater
than a threshold and the channel dispersion is high, the 2D RAKE receiver is on the proposed
configuration. However, when the correlation among antenna branches is below a threshold and
channel dispersion is short, the 2D RAKE receiver is switched back to the mesh-grid configuration.
The threshold is a function of many parameters including the number of antenna branches, the
number of taps on each antenna branch, and the delay spread of the channel. The precise value of
the threshold can be determined through simulation runs as in the Section 4, or through field trials.
The tap weights of the proposed configuration can be determined based on the solution of a
least square problem from a maximum likelihood formulation, similar to [21,22]. The mesh-grid
configuration and the proposed configuration have the same total number of fingers, Nm )1(  ,
which is equal to the number of antenna branches N times the number of fingers )1( m
(RAKE diversity) in each antenna branch. The proposed configuration is a preferred mode than
the mesh-grid configuration especially when the correlation between antenna branches is high and
the delay spread is relatively long.
There are other configurations which can reduce correlation among antenna branches. But the
proposed scheme causes a minimal increase of the overall span of delay taps. Normally, the goal
of the finger assignment scheme is to reduce the number of overlapped taps among antenna
branches while minimally increases the overall span of tap delays.
14
a fixed, on , where on is the number of overlapped taps between a pair of antenna branches. In
general, there exists a tradeoff between the on and the overall span of tap delays, dT . The greater
the value of on is, the smaller the value of dT . For simplicity, we discuss on in two cases,
0on (case I) and 1on (case II). For 1on , we notice that the reduction of the overall span of
tap delays is small, but the correlation increases significantly. For both cases I and II, we assume a
configuration of 12  mmN antenna branches, each of which has 1m taps.
<Case I> 0on . There is no overlapped fingers between antenna branches and the overall span
of tap delays, dT , is equal to the total number of tap points, that is, Nm )1(  . In this
configuration, one tap for each delay time and there is no correlation among antenna branches.
Most likely, some of the taps will not pick up signals unless the channel dispersion is relatively
long. We will consider using this type of configuration only in the case the channel dispersion is
extremely long. The overall span, dT , would be 21 units for the configuration in Figure 1. Even
though the cross correlation is low, the increase of overall span of tap delay is seven fold.
<Case II> 1on . This case is most interesting since the cross correlation between antenna
branches is minimal, and the increase of the overall span is moderate. For example, in Figure 2,
1on , the overall span, dT , is 7 using a finite projective plane of 7 points. The number of
overlap of tap between a pair of antenna branches has been reduced from three to one. We first
show that 1on is the most efficient configuration, and then show that the
the overall tap delays for 1on is minimal.
The most efficient configuration ( 1on )
To show that 1on is the most efficient, Table 1 lists the adjusted correlation a and
overall span of tap delays, dT , for 0on , 1, and 1m , respectively, where a is equal to the
spatial fading correlation  times the percentage of overlapped taps between two antenna
16
the proposed scheme, dfT , is minimum.
Lemma 1:  diSidf TT min for 1on and 1
2  mmN , where m is a positive integer .
<Proof> There is one pair of overlapped taps between each pair of antenna branches for 1on .
Thus, the total number of pairs of overlapped taps for N antenna branches is equal to
2
)1( NN
.
The proof is divided into three steps. In Step 1 we show that optimal configuration must have the
property that the taps are uniformly distributed among the delay times. In Step 2, we show that if
we shorten the span of tap delays of the proposed configuration, the number of pairs of overlapped
taps increases. Thus, the dT of the proposed configuration is minimal. In Step 3, we show that
the proposed configuration is the only solution that fits.
Step 1: If we allow points to be allocated unevenly, the number of pairs of overlapped points
increases. As shown in Figure 3, the number of taps for it and 1it are bm 1 and
bm 1 , respectively, where b is the number of points moved from delay time 1it to it in a
uniform configuration with )1( m points for each delay time. The number of pairs of
overlapped points is changed from )1(

2  mmmm to
22
2
))(1(

))(1(
bmm
bmbmbmbm  . Thus there is a net increase of 2b pairs of
overlapped points. Uneven distribution of points increases the number of pairs of overlapped
points.
Using the proposed scheme, the pairs of overlapped points are distributed evenly into N
delay times, and thus each delay time is allocated 2/)1( N pairs of points. However, we note
that

among the N delay times.

high dispersion channels. If the channel dispersion is short and the correlation between antenna
branches is small, the mesh-grid configuration is preferred.

5. Further Remarks
The proposed configuration can be applied to a fractionally-spaced configuration, where the
minimum spacing between adjacent fingers within the same antenna branch can be less than W/1 .
In addition to the fact that the number of overlapped taps between two antenna branches is one, the
number of overlapped taps between two adjacent delay times is also one based on the property of
the finite projective plane. For example, the taps are located at antenna branches 1, 2, and 3 in
delay time 1 of Figure 2. In delay time 2, the taps are located at antennas branches 1, 4, and 5.
For each delay time, the antenna branches with a tap correspond to the points of a set. Thus, there
is only one overlapped tap between two delay times. Since it is possible to have correlation
between adjacent delay times in fractionally-spaced configuration, the correlation induced by
fractionally-spaced configuration within the same antenna branch using the proposed scheme is
also minimal.
