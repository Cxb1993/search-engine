main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.
• The dependency of the error performance of SSK-type
modulation on the minimum Hamming distance between
arbitrary two modulation symbols has been previously
reported (see, e.g., [18]). In this paper, we show that
the employment of a fixed number of activated an-
tennas poses a fundamental limit on the performance
of GSSK (including SSK) modulation. Specifically, we
show, among other properties of GSSK, that the min-
imum Hamming distance between arbitrary two GSSK
symbols is always equal to 2.
• We investigate the important issue of energy-efficient
transmission using SSK-type modulation. The proposed
design framework considers a varied number of activated
antennas, thus overcoming the limitation of GSSK mod-
ulation as mentioned above. The optimal transmission
strategy is derived theoretically, which is achieved by the
proposed practical EE-HSSK modulation scheme. The
design of EE-HSSK is facilitated by a novel use of
the bit-mapping technique (rather than the compression
capability) of Huffman coding. The energy efficiency
of EE-HSSK in comparison with existing schemes is
verified by simulation. Various implementation issues of
EE-HSSK are discussed.
This paper is organized as follows. Sec. II presents the
system description. The design problem and theoretical results
for energy-efficient transmission are presented in Sec. III. The
practical energy-efficient modulation scheme is described in
Sec. IV. Performance results are demonstrated in Sec. V.
Conclusion is given in Sec. VI.

II. TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS WITH SSK-TYPE
MODULATION
A. System Model
We consider an uncoded MIMO system with NT transmit
antennas and NR receive antennas (denoted by an NT ×NR
system). The system employs an SSK-type modulation scheme
that uses solely the antenna indices to carry information. The
complex baseband signal model is given by
y = H
√
Esx˜+ v (1)
where y ∈ CNR×1 is the received signal, x˜ is the NT × 1
transmitted symbol comprised of 1’s (corresponding to ac-
tivated antennas) and 0’s (corresponding to idle antennas),
H ∈ CNR×NT is the flat-fading channel, v ∈ CNR×1 is the
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), and Es is the transmit
power at each antenna. Channel matrixH has independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) complex Gaussian entries with
zero mean and covariance matrix σ2HINR , where σ2H = 1.
The channel information is assumed perfectly known to the
receiver. Noise v has i.i.d. complex elements with zero mean
and covariance matrix (N0/2)INR . Transmitted symbol x˜ is
selected from the modulation alphabet (constellation set) A
with a priori probability P (x˜), where
∑
x˜∈A P (x˜) = 1.
B. System Performance
Given the signal model in (1), optimal detection is the
maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimate, i.e.,
x˜MAP = argmax
x∈A
p(y|x)P (x) (2)
or equivalently
x˜MAP = argmax
x∈A
log
(
p(y|x)P (x)
)

where
p(y|x) = 1
πNR
(
N0
2
)NR exp(− 2N0
∥∥∥y −H√Esx∥∥∥2 ). (4)
Therefore,
x˜MAP = argmin
x∈A
( ∥∥∥y −H√Esx∥∥∥2 − logP (x)). (5)
When alphabet A contains equiprobable elements, i.e.,
P (x) = 1/|A| for all x, MAP detection reduces to maximum
likelihood (ML) detection which does not incorporate the a
priori probabilities in its detection metric [27].
The system performance based on MAP detection can
be quantified by first deriving the pairwise error probability
(PEP) and then averaging the PEP over all pairwise symbol
combinations. Let xi and xj be two distinct symbols in A.
Following the same derivation approach in [17], [18], the PEP
of deciding on xj given that xi = x˜ is transmitted is given
by
P (xi → xj |xi = x˜) =
∫ ∞

where L(xi,xj)  log
(
P (xi)/P (xj)
)
is the log-ratio be-
tween the a priori probability of xi and xj , fZ is the
probability density function (pdf) of Z = ∑2NRk=1 z2k, where
zk’s are i.i.d. N (0, σ2z) with σ2z = Esd(xi,xj)/(2NTN0),
and d(xi,xj) is the Hamming distance between xi and xj .
The system error probability Ps can be derived by averaging
the result in (6) over all pairwise combinations, i.e.,
Ps =
∑
xi =xj∈A
P (xi)P (xj |xj = xi)P (xi → xj |xi = x˜).
(7)
The dominant terms in (7) involve the error events of symbol
xi with the largest a priori probability P (xi). The PEP in
these dominant terms can be obtained by substituting the
known expression of fZ into (6) and using the Chernoff
bound Q(x) ≤ (1/2) exp(−x2/2), x ≥ 0 in (6) (since

support of 2 bits/s/Hz transmission in a system with NT = 5.
Clearly, there is a tradeoff in terms of achievable rate, dmin,
power and hardware costs in the selection of design options.
For a detailed coverage on the comparison of HSSK and
GSSK, the reader is referred to [18].
Since HSSK modulation employs a varied number of 1’s
in the modulation symbols to fully utilize the set of antenna
indices, some modulation symbols naturally require higher
transmission power and more activated transmit antennas than
others. This motivates an energy-efficient and hardware-cost-
aware refinement of HSSK-enabled transmission that main-
tains the advantages of HSSK modulation. The design problem
and theoretical results are presented next, and a practical
energy-efficient HSSK transmission scheme is presented in
Sec. IV.
B. Problem Formulation
Let Us be the NT -dimensional binary symbol universe, i.e.,
Us = {[x1, x2, . . . , xNT ]T |xj ∈ {0, 1}, j = 1, . . . , NT}, and
Ui (i = 0, 1, . . . , NT ) be a subset of U s containing symbols
with exactly i 1’s, i.e., Ui =
{
[x1, x2, . . . , xNT ]
T |xj ∈
{0, 1}, j = 1, . . . , NT ,
∑NT
j=1 xj = i
}
. The HSSK modu-
lation alphabet with a specified dmin property incorporates
selected codewords in the code C = ⋃i Ci with minimum
distance d = dmin, where Ci ⊆ Ui (i ∈ {1, . . . , NT })
is the nonempty set of codewords containing exactly i 1’s.
The all-zero symbol in U0 is not used in the modulation
alphabet and is reserved for special use (see Sec. IV-B).
For example, in the previously described example, the HSSK
modulation alphabet incorporates all codewords in the (5, 2)
code C = C1
⋃ C2⋃ C5 with d = dmin = 3 to achieve
2 bits/s/Hz transmission in a system with NT = 5, where
|C1| = |C5| = 1 and |C2| = 2. It is often useful to further
restrict the required number of RF chains at the transmitter
to M (1 ≤ M ≤ NT ) for the modulation scheme. Therefore,
the objective of energy-efficient transmission based on HSSK
modulation is to design an alphabet and the symbol a priori
probabilities so that minimum average symbol power per
transmission E[x˜H x˜] is achieved, while the target transmission
rate (spectral-efficiency constraint), the minimum Hamming
distance property (performance constraint), and the maximum
required number of RF chains (hardware constraint) are met.
Given a code C = ⋃i Ci with the specified minimum distance
property, and given the fact that each element in C i requires i
RF chains at the transmitter and consumes power equal to i,
the design problem is mathematically formulated as
min
Pi
∑
i:Ci⊆C
i≤M
i|Ci|Pi
s.t.
∑
i:Ci⊆C
i≤M
|Ci|Pi = 1
∑
i:Ci⊆C
i≤M
|Ci|r(Pi) ≥ m (9)
where Pi is the a priori probability of each symbol in C i, i.e.,
Pi  P (x),x ∈ Ci, and
r(Pi) =
⎧⎨
⎩
−Pi log2 Pi, if Pi > 0
0, if Pi = 0
−∞, otherwise
. (10)
The first constraint of Problem (9) states that the a priori
probabilities of all symbols in the alphabet sum to one, and
implies that Pi = 0 for i for which Ci  C or i > M . The
second constraint states that the target information rate of m
bits is met, described by Shannon’s entropy formula. Clearly,
the optimal power yielded in Problem (9) with a larger M is
no greater than with a smaller M .
Consider an example. Suppose that it is desired to de-
sign a modulation alphabet with dmin = 2. The largest
set of length-NT codewords with d = dmin = 2 is the
(NT , NT − 1) binary parity check code. More specifically,
the code C is given by C1
⋃ C3⋃ C5⋃ · · ·⋃ CNT if NT is
odd and C1
⋃ C3⋃ C5⋃ · · ·⋃ CNT−1 if NT is even, where
Ci = Ui. Since |Ci| = |Ui| =
(
NT
i
)
, the design problem is
specifically formulated as
min
{P1,P3,P5,...}
M∑
i=1,3,5,...
i
(
NT
i
)
Pi
s.t.

i=1,3,5,...
(
NT
i
)
Pi = 1
M∑
i=1,3,5,...
(
NT
i
)
r(Pi) ≥ m. (11)
The first constraint of Problem (11) implies that P2, P4, . . .
are all equal to zero, meaning that symbols in U2,U4, . . . are
not included in the modulation alphabet.
C. Optimal Solution
Note that Problem (9) has a linear objective subject to
affine equality and convex inequality constraints. Therefore,
they are convex optimization problems with a globally optimal
solution, and can be solved using the Lagrange multiplier

symbol power. Since longer bit strings appear less frequently
in a random input sequence, symbols more power-consuming
are used less frequently to achieve energy efficiency. Note
that the optimal a priori probability given by Problem (11)
for a symbol is only approximately matched by probability
2−k using Huffman coding, where k is the length of the
bit string associated with the symbol. Therefore, EE-HSSK
modulation may achieve a slightly different transmission rate
than is configured in Problem (9) or (11), and may incur an
energy penalty compared to the optimal theoretical results. The
energy penalty, however, is generally very small (see Sec. V).
Due to the unequal length of bit strings, if an error occurs
in the detector, the Huffman encoder at the receiver will map
the incorrect symbol to a bit string that is different from the
transmitted one and possibly of a different length. The mis-
match in the bit length will result in an error propagation effect
affecting all subsequent symbols regardless of whether they
are correctly detected. Among other solutions, the following
methods may help resolve this issue.
1) Frame-based operation: In the frame (packet)-based op-
eration of EE-HSSK scheme, the input bit sequence is
divided into frames. Each frame is transmitted using mul-
tiple EE-HSSK modulation symbols. Different frames are
separated by the all-zero (“idle”) symbol which signals
the beginning/end of the transmission of a frame. If the
mismatch effect occurs, it affects the current frame but

not the next frame.
2) Channel coding and interleaving: If the information
sequence is protected by the channel encoder and the
interleaver before entering the Huffman decoder, the bit
errors resulted from the mismatch effect in a frame will
be deinterleaved to non-contiguous locations and could
be corrected by the channel decoder.
We consider the frame-based implementation of EE-HSSK
enabled transmission in the uncoded scenarios. Operation
details and an embedded capability of this implementation are
described below.
1) Residual bit mapping: In the frame-based implementa-
tion, if the residual bits at the end of a frame are not
sufficient to map to an EE-HSSK symbol, the initial bits
of the next frame are borrowed to complete the mapping.
At the receiver, extra bits beyond a frame are discarded.
This is illustrated in Fig. 2, where the exemplary EE-
HSSK mapping in Table III are adopted.
2) Partial error detection (ED): The frame-based imple-
mentation enables partial ED at no extra cost. Specifi-
cally, when the receiver recovers a bit sequence shorter
than the frame size, or longer than the frame size plus
the maximum length of EE-HSSK symbols minus one,
the receiver detects an incorrect frame being received.
This is illustrated in Fig. 2. This embedded partial ED
mechanism can be used in conjunction with automatic
repeat request (ARQ) to improve the frame transmission
performance, as will be demonstrated in Sec. V.
V. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, we show the simulation results for the
performance of the proposed energy-efficient transmission
scheme in comparison with the theoretical results and the
conventional schemes. The frame size is set to 100 bits in
simulation, and enough frames are simulated to count 300
frame errors. The lexicographic constellation design is adopted
for GSSK modulation for computational efficiency without
much loss of performance [18]. The detection algorithm is
MAP for all schemes.
In Fig. 3, we plot the average symbol power per transmis-
sion E[x˜H x˜] versus the transmission rate for different SSK-
type modulation schemes. First, we see that a more flexible
utilization of the antenna indices allows HSSK to achieve
different dmin values while GSSK always has dmin = 2. The

efficient transmission strategy. We see that EE-HSSK with
M = 3 and M = NT have almost identical performance, both
outperforming the original GSSK/HSSK and the conventional
QAM (with gray-coded bit mapping). HSSK with dmin = 3
configuration exhibits a slight disadvantage of performance
as compared with dmin = 2 configuration, suggesting that
in these particular scenarios the improved error performance
due to a larger dmin does not outweigh the extra power spent
for creating a larger dmin. The performance gap between EE-
HSSK and GSSK/HSSK is about 1.5–2 dB at SER = 10−3
and FER = 10−2 in both Figs. 4 and 5. The embedded ED
mechanism working in conjunction with ARQ-based transmis-
sion can further improve the FER performance of EE-HSSK.
With the implementation of ED, a frame in error, when de-
tected, is retransmitted so that with high probability it will be
received correctly with joint detection of the two transmissions
(we assume that the first retransmission is always successful
in our simulation). The performance improvement is however
slight, since not all frame error patterns can be detected by

VI. CONCLUSION
The energy efficiency of SSK-type modulation enabled
transmission over MIMO wireless channels has been studied.
A theoretical framework for the design of energy-efficient
communication forms the foundation for the development of
a practical energy-efficient modulation scheme. The proposed
modulation scheme incorporates a novel use of the Hamming
code and Huffman code techniques in the alphabet and bit-
mapping designs. The proposed modulation scheme carries
an energy-saving potential unachievable in previous schemes,
as demonstrated by extensive simulations, and shows great
promise for next-generation green MIMO communications.
APPENDIX
PROPERTIES OF GSSK MODULATION
Recall that, to support m bits/s/Hz transmission in a sys-
tem with NT transmit antennas, GSSK modulation adopts a
modulation alphabet A(GSSK) with 2m NT × 1 symbols each
comprised of nt 1’s and NT −nt 0’s, where nt is chosen such
that(
NT
nt − 1
)
<
∣∣∣A(GSSK)∣∣∣ = 2m ≤ (NT
nt
)
and nt ≤ NT
2
.
(17)
Lemma 1: The Hamming distance between arbitrary two
distinct GSSK symbols xi,xj ∈ A(GSSK) is a positive even
number, i.e., d(xi,xj) = 2, 4, 6, . . ..
Proof: Assume xi and xj differ in k positions, 1 ≤ k ≤
NT . Thus, d(xi,xj) = k. Since the numbers of 1’s in xi and
xj are equal, and xi and xj are identical in the other NT − k
positions, xi and xj contain the same number of 1’s, say l,
where 1 ≤ l ≤ nt, in these k positions. Since xi and xj differ
in these k positions, we must have k = 2l.
Theorem 1: For any A(GSSK), the minimum Hamming
distance between arbitrary two distinct GSSK symbols is 2,
i.e., dmin = minxi =xj∈A(GSSK) d(xi,xj) = 2.

symbol candidates can have a pairwise Hamming distance
larger than 2 as NT increases, a result of the inefficiency of
the fixed nt construction in GSSK modulation.
