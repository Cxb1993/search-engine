一、中文摘要 
半導體產業為國家重點產業之一，晶圓製造更為半導體產業的核心。由於晶圓製造複雜
且具再回流特性，現場控制與管理便成為一十分重要的管理課題。過去研究多專注在個別生
產控制策略（如：交期指派、投料、派工、物料搬運及重加工等）的探討，但由於各類生產
控制策略間之交互作用十分明顯，因此整合型研究應為提升整體控制策略績效的重心所在。 
本計畫將嘗試以負荷導向為基礎，考慮晶圓廠現場序列式瓶頸機台、序列式關鍵資源、
批次式關鍵資源等機台之排程問題，發展整合式排程策略，並進一步將負荷控管的結果延伸
利用至投料評估及交期控管決策上，發展以負荷導向為基礎之整合式現場排程策略。 
本計畫主要重點包括：一、發展以負荷導向為基礎之整合式現場排程策略；二、以負荷
導向為基礎構建工件投料與控管機制。及三、以負荷導向為基礎構建訂單接單與交期承諾機
制，希望透過本研究計畫構建之「以負荷導向為基礎之整合式現場排程策略」可有效考慮各
類型機台及各種現場排程派工策略間之交互影響狀況，有效提升晶圓製造廠現場控制策略之
整體績效。

Abstract 
Semiconductor industry is one of the focus-industry in Taiwan. Wafer fabrication is the core 
of the semiconductor manufacturing. Owing to the complex production technology and reentry, 
shop floor control is very important topic in wafer fabrication. The researches are focus on the 
single SFC strategies, like as due date assignment, order review and release, dispatching, rework, 
etc. Because of the interactions among SFC strategies are very significant; the integration of SFC 
strategies is the core topic of improving the performance of production control. 
This project will try to build an integrated scheduling strategy with considering scheduling 
problems of serial bottleneck, serial critical workstations, and batching workstations based on

機與維修常為系統不穩定的來源，現場排程規劃者應如何訂出適當之在
製品存量標準，並如何做投料控制，才能使瓶頸機台無缺料之虞。  
5. 全球運籌與供應鍊管理的趨勢下，即時達交已成為高科技產業的重要績
效指標，接單時應如何決定適當的交期將直接影響達交績效。  
由以上的困難可知，如何發展一套有效的生產管制策略，提升晶圓製造的
績效，為一十分重要的研究課題。尤其在現場投料決策、機台派工與瓶頸管理
等方面。  
目前與半導體晶圓廠製造現場管理策略相關的研究，主要重點多在發展或
改善單一現場管理策略，如：交期指派、投料、派工、及重加工等，對策略間
的交互作用多未加考慮。但研究顯示各類現場管理策略間之交互作用十分明
顯，討論現場控制策略時若忽略策略間的交互作用，實無法確實提升整體績
效。因此實需要整合交期指派、投料、派工及重加工等現場控制策略，將其相
互間之交互作用及對績效指標之影響予以整合，構建整合性現場控制策略模
式，使現場管理控制能有整合性的規劃，避免僅局部考量單一特定策略時，獲
致之績效僅為局部最適化的缺憾。  
另外，由於晶圓廠現場派工策略研究的重點多在瓶頸機台，常忽略其他非
瓶頸機台，但由於晶圓製造中再回流的特性，工件將多次回到相同機台加工，
因此瓶頸機台與其他非瓶頸機台間的相互影響便顯得十分重要；尤其許多屬於
關鍵資源（ critical resource）的批次處理機台（如：爐管）由於係每層晶圓必
經的製程且加工時間普遍較長，如何掌握其生產控制策略（包括：每次生產的
集批數量？生產順序？）使後續瓶頸機台的加工能順利進行，以圓滿達成交期
並有效降低工件加工等待時間便顯得十分重要。  
因此本計畫將延續計畫主持人及其研究團隊過去對晶圓廠整合性現場管
理策略之相關成果，嘗試以負荷導向為基礎，構建能整體考慮各類型機台（序
列瓶頸機台、序列關鍵機台及批次關鍵機台等）派工及重加工等因素的整合式
排程策略，以提高排程派工策略之整體適用性。  
本計畫預計完成工作項目與成果包括：  
1. 依據實際案例構建虛擬晶圓廠，作為長期研究的基礎。  
2. 構建資料挖礦預測、推估模式與負荷導向控制模式，充分利用相關資料
萃取相關資訊，協助進行相關決策。  
3. 將各類常用的現場控制策略法則構建至虛擬晶圓廠，建構虛擬晶圓製造
管理之研究平台。  
4. 構建「以負荷導向為基礎之整合式現場排程策略」。

SA(starvation avoidance ) 、 UNIF(uniform) 、 DBR （ drum buffer rope ）、 TB
（ two-boundary）等，Kim 等 (1998)則針對 WR 法則修正後提出 PWR（ parametric 
workload regulating）。相關研究的重心多在利用各種生產效率衡量的指標來評
估投料法則之優劣，評估時多將現場排 程派工法則予以簡化（多數假設為
FIFO）。  
2. 序列機台派工（瓶頸機台） 
晶圓廠的排程方面，晶圓廠機台主要分為兩類，一種為序列式機台，即工
件逐一進入機台加工，完工後再繼續後一製程。此類機台排程派工的研究多著
重在瓶頸機台。另一類機台為批次處理機台，此類機台具備將相同產品或製程
的工作集結成批同時一起加工的特性，在此先討論序列式機台派工的相關文獻。 
由於晶圓加工必須利用微影製程將許多層的電路建立在晶圓上，因此每片
晶圓在加工過程中必須一再進入微影黃光區。由於微影製程的設備甚為昂貴，
且為晶圓製造之關鍵製程，通常微影黃光區都是晶圓廠的瓶頸工作站。因此晶
圓廠的排程研究方面，有許多學者特別針對微影黃光區之排程方法進行探討，
以提高整體生產績效。較傳統的排程方法包括： SPT（ shortest process time）、
EDD(earliest due date)、CR(critical ratio)、 FCFS（ first  come first service）、
SRPT(shortest remaining processing time)等，根據 Glassary & Resende(1988)利
用系統模擬研究發現 SRPT 的表現狀況較佳。除此之外，Kim 等 (1998)曾提出針
對加工循環（ loop）之加工負荷水準加以考量的 LWL（ loop workload leveling）
法則。另外除了微影黃光區外的製程，如氧化、薄膜沈積、蝕刻、擴散、離子
植入及清洗等可以進行批量處理的製程，則有許多學者針對批量排程（ batch 
scheduling）進行研究，批量排程通常包括批量決定與排程派工兩個問題。關於
批量訂定方面 Uzsoy 等 (1994)指出 MBS（minimum batch size）最常被應用，亦
即當等候批量累積數大於預設值時便開始生產。在批量處理的排程派工方面，
除 FCFS 等通用的派工法則外，Kim(1998)利用 SA 法的精神提出 BFQL（Back and 
Front queues leveling）的派工法則，以提昇整體效率。  
3. 批次式機台派工法則 
半導體製程中，晶圓製造為最重要的階段，晶圓廠中有許多批次處理機台，
包括：清洗、測試等，其中由於製程中需一再進入爐管進行烘烤測試，平均在
爐管的製程時間約佔 30％，這也是晶圓製造週期過長的主因之一（Rulkens et al.  
1998）。欲有效降低晶圓製造週期時間，則爐管的生產管控為不容忽視的問題。
爐管也成為晶圓廠中最為重要的批次處理機台。  
批次處理機台的派工問題包括兩個主要問題，其一為集批法則（ batching 
rule），由於批次處理機台可同時處理許多工件，應累積多少數量的工件才開始
進入加工，此為集批法則主要解決的問題；其二為派工法則，所有達到累積批
 7
Weng et al.（ 1993）則將最小持有成本的概念融入 DBH 中提出 MCR
（minimum cost rate），亦即在規劃 DBH 的規劃幅度時改用等候時間作為評估
依據，此法在等候線工件數的變異上明顯優於 MBS、DBH 及 NACH。MCR 進
行決策時並不像 DBH 受到規劃幅度的限制，其限制在於機台到滿載時的前瞻工
件數。當機台開始新的加工循環時，MCR 將對所有可能的加工點計算在固定期
間內之平均等候時間長度，選擇最小平均等候時間的時點載入加工。MCR 在多
產品單機的環境亦適用，規劃中沿用 NACH 的規劃方式，在評估某一產品種類
進行加工時，僅需計算其他產品所累積的總延遲時間即可。  
Robinson et al.（ 1995）及 Van et al.(1997)則分別結合 MCR、NACH 提出整
合式的方法 RHCR-S 及 DJAH，RHCR-S 首先嘗試考慮後續機台的狀況，在縮短
機台間流動時間有明顯效果。DJAH 則主要強調成本之考量應由單位時間最小
化改為單位批量項目最小化，DJAH 的優點在於績效的穩定性及可適用到多產
品多機的環境。  
謝志岳（ 1997）則針對晶圓廠黃光區以限制理論的概念構建可同時兼顧多
績效因子的派工法則，並同時考慮爐管區特殊的機台特性，建構批次派工法則，
並利用模擬系統的驗證，同時在利用率、週期時間、等候時間及其變異上均有
顯著的改善。本計畫主持人（ Sha & Hsu, 2004c）則首先提出考慮交期急迫性的
前瞻式成批派工法則 LBCR，並分別將 MBSX、NACH、MCR、DJAH 等法則加
以修正，使其適用在多產品、多機的環境，再透過模擬分析來驗證，結果發現
LBCR 在平均延遲時間及延遲比率上的表現明顯優於其他法則。  
(3)未來訂單到達資訊完全已知  
隨著資訊科技的發展，及生產系統資訊化程度的提高，生產系統確實可能
達到完全預估某些資訊的可能，但由於製造現場的不安定性，當機、不良品及
人員的不穩定性等多將提高系統隨機性，因此此類法則由於在現場將面臨隨機
性的嚴苛挑戰，實務上尚屬過度理想化的預期，在此不深入討論。  
經由上述分析可明顯發現，批次處理機台由於其加工特性明顯不同於序列
式機台，故其排程策略亦較為複雜，另外由於批次處理機台加工時間通常明顯
較序列式機台長，也面臨排程失當則將面臨完工時程將大幅延後的壓力，因此，
雖多數批次處理機台多不是系統的瓶頸機台，但仍受到普遍的重視。晶圓廠的
爐管烘烤區更是如此。然而經過文獻探討與初步資料蒐集發現，現有批次機台
排程法則多仍停留在局部績效考量的階段，雖可略微提高工件通過批次處理製
程的時間，維持批次處理機台的利用率，但由於欠缺全面考量的結果，當系統
長期運作，局部的績效改善多將被不良的生產控制策略整合界面所抵銷（即集
批策略的改善績效受到其他生產控制策略的影響而削減，如投料、瓶頸派工、
不良品重工處理等）；此種現象在晶圓製造廠尤為明顯。因此構建可充分考慮各

計畫採用的方法及技術說明如下：  
（ 1）  限制管理負荷控制技術  
生產系統工作負荷高低及分佈狀況，將直接決定系統工件完工時間及在製
品數量。如何有效控管系統負荷，為近來生產系統現場管理的主要核心問題。
其中以工作負荷為基礎之投料、派工策略亦陸續被發展出來。各類負荷控制技
術中尤以限制管理負荷技術（TOC）最受重視，以系統限制的觀點，協助規劃
系統負荷，進而探討工作負荷水準與負荷平衡等相關問題，為目前許多學者致
力研究的方向。本計畫將以 WLC 為基礎，並嘗試利用 TOC 相關理論與技術，
構建能充分掌握系統各類型機台工作負荷，及在各類投料、派工及重加工策略
之交互作用下，對系統未來負荷及後續流程負荷平衡進行有效率的推算，協助
進行整合式排程決策。  
（ 2）  資料挖礦（Data Mining）  
負荷控制技術的成功關鍵在於對未來系統負荷變化及其對後續機台的負荷
影響程度之預估準確度。因此由於虛擬晶圓廠的構建，大量系統相關資訊的取
得將協助我們進行系統後續負荷變化的預估與掌控。透過資料挖礦技術中的類
神經網路 (Artificial Neural Network)及決策樹（Decision Tree）等預測與分類的
技術，嘗試構建較精準的預估模式，提高對機台後續生產需求的掌握能力，使
生產系統整體排程策略能符合整體控制目標。  
（ 3）  系統模擬（System Simulation）  
由於晶圓廠製造流程的高度複雜性，及高產能成本。因此生產控制策略的
驗證與模擬多無法利用實際晶圓廠來進行。本計畫將以第一階段依據實際個案
構建之虛擬晶圓廠為基礎，透過系統模擬與實驗設計等技術，進行現場相關資
料蒐集及策略驗證與分析，透過實際的比較分析，驗證構建之整合式排程策略
的成效。  
3.不同接單策略與投料策略對現場排程策略之影響與因應  
在計畫第二階段，研究小組將透過虛擬晶圓廠，將各類不同接單策略、交
期承諾機制與投料策略之主要代表性法則納入討論，進一步分析在各種不同接
單、交期決策及投料策略之影響下，生產系統中各類型機台工作負荷的變化狀
況，進一步探討在不同生產系統投料、序列式機台派工、批次式機台集批及派
工等現場管理策略組合，對工作負荷的影響，以尋求可能的因應對策；另一方
面將以計畫產出水準為基礎，在維持系統負荷平衡的策略下，提出對投料機制
的調整建議，更希望能進一步協助接單部門在交期協議過程中，能兼顧系統負
荷平衡狀況，以能確保系統計畫產出水準之前提，承諾合理可行的交期。  
選用的投料、派工（序列式機台集批次式機台）法則將以計畫主持人在 2004

result in a higher product yield and better capacity given tool
inventory and facility constraints. Therefore, we think that
minimizing the customer order flow time in order-based
production system is a promising area of research.
Furthermore, because of the complexity of the COS problem,
the existing studies focused primarily on developing and
comparing dispatching rules and due date setting mechanisms,
not on proposing an order releasing policy. The primary
objective of the present study is to develop a scheduling
system, which we call the Coordinated Scheduling of
Customer Orders (CSCO), involving an order releasing
policy and a dispatching rule for the COS problem in
dynamic job shop environments, in order to improve the
customer order flow time. The results of our experiments
indicate that the CSCO performs better than the conventional
scheduling combinations of order releasing policies and
dispatching rules.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. A
description of the order releasing policy and dispatching rule
follows in the next section. In section 3, our proposed
framework is described in detail. Then, in the fourth section
the simulation model and the experimental design used to
study the performance of the scheduling system are discussed.
We present some general observations of the results in the
fifth section. In the final section we provide a summary of the
results and make some suggestions for future work.
2. RELATED WORK
In order to describe the process of developing two
decision-making schemes that are included in our proposed
CSCO for improving the customer order flow time, it will be
helpful to first discuss the following two areas as background:
order releasing policy and dispatching rule.
2.1 Order releasing policy
After arrival, orders may be released to the shop floor at
any time. The order releasing policy determines when and
what job in the pre-shop pool (PSP) should be released. To
date, several policies have been studied and proposed in the
literatures, ranging in complexity from simple to complicated.
In this study, we test three order releasing policies that are
most frequently used in previous studies and have different
characteristics from one another: immediate release (IMR),
constant work in process (CONWIP), and predicted release
date (PRD).
In IMR, an order is released to the shop floor as soon as it
is accepted, regardless of the shop status or the characteristics
of the order being released. Melnyk and Ragatz (1989)
indicated that IMR, which corresponds to the
no-order-review/release policy, showed better delivery and
mean job flow time performance. Bertrand and van de
Wakker (2002) concluded that all jobs of an order are best to
be released immediately upon the arrival of the order for
assembly job shop: it results in the shorter assembly order
flow time.
The CONWIP policy was proposed by Spearman et al. in
1990. It has drawn the attention of many researchers because
it has substantial advantages of being able to directly control
WIP using cards, and can be applied to a wider variety of
manufacturing environments. The CONWIP policy states that
when a job is in its final processing stage, a new job must be
released into the shop. Limiting the amount of WIP reduces
storage, costs, allows the quick identification of quality
problems, and permits a rapid response to machine
breakdown, material shortage or worker unavailability (Ryan
et al. 2000).
The PRD policy determines the release date of each job
through a prediction technique. A job is released whenever it
reaches its release date. PRD mechanisms are like backward
infinite loading (BIL) and the modified infinite loading (MIL)
(Ragatz and Mabert, 1988), determining the job release date
through a regression model based on a number of predictive
factors. Moreira and Alive (2006) showed that the time period
an order spends in the warehouse of finished goods waiting to
be delivered, can be reduced if PRD is used.
The central idea of the proposed order releasing policy is
to present a hybrid architecture combining the concepts of
CONWIP and PRD to result in performance improvements
over traditional one-representation architectures. It inherits
the advantages of both policies, in order to support CSCO for
reducing WIP and order waiting time in the warehouse, so as
to improve the customer order flow time.
2.2 Dispatching rule
A variety of dispatching rules were tested in Blocher et al.
(1998) in the order-based production system, divided into five
classes: arrival oriented, due date oriented, processing time
oriented, job complexity oriented, and ratio oriented. Among
them, the simple rules, EDD, SPT, and FCFS performed well
in this kind of production system. EDD seems to be the most
robust of the rules. Deciding which rule to use must be
determined not only by the desired performance measure, but
also by due date tightness and shop utilization. In this study,
five dispatching rules were investigated in order of the
increasing sophistication in their use of information for
determining the next job to be processed on an available
machine: first come first served (FCFS), earliest due date
(EDD), and shortest processing time (SPT), Shortest
remaining processing time (SRT), and critical ratio (CR). We
chose those rules, because they do not need parameter
estimation, are most frequently used in previous studies, and
each has different characteristics. Among these rules, EDD is
a due date oriented rule, SRT and SPT are processing time
oriented rules, FCFS is a arrival oriented rule, and CR is a

3.2.1 Model trees
A technique for predicting real value, “model trees,” was 
developed by Quinlan (1992) and accounted M5 system.
There are three major stages in a model tree construction.
First the tree-based model is generated in a top-down
recursive divide-and-conquer manner. At the start, all the
training cases are at the root node. Cases are partitioned
recursively based on selected attributes which do the best job
in discriminating cases, and so make the activity levels in the
subset more homogeneous. The attribute which maximizes
the expected reduction in error is chosen for splitting the
cases at the node. The expected reduction in error can be
written as equation (3) and is given in Quinlan (1992).
  

Tsderror ……………..……(3)
where T is the set of cases that reaches this node, T1,
T2… are the subsets of cases that result from spliting the 
node according to the chosen attribute, and the sd function
calculates the standard deviation of the target values of a set
of cases. The process of splitting the node is terminated when
very few cases are contained or when there is only a slight
variation in the target value of cases reaching a node.
Second, after the tree-based model is built, a multivariate
linear model is implemented for the cases at each node of the
tree-based model using the standard regression technique.
However, instead of using all attributes, this linear model is
restricted to only using the attributes referenced by the tests
or linear models in the subtree at this node (Quinlan, 1992).
The third stage prunes the tree, starting near the bottom.
For each non-leaf node of the tree, M5 selects as the final
model either the simplified linear model above or the subtree,
depending on which has the lower estimated error (Quinlan,
1992).
When a tree-based model is built to predict the value of
an unseen case, the tree is followed down to a leaf, according
to the attribute values of the case in order to make routing
decisions at each node. The leaf involves a linear model
based on some attributes, and the value of the case is
predicted by that linear model yielding a raw predicted value.
Quinlan (1992) used a smoothing process to compensate for
the sharp discontinuities. The smoothing process filters the
predicted value at each node along the path from the leaf to
the root. An appropriate smoothing calculation is given in
Wang and Witten (1997) and is shown in equation (4).

where p′is the prediction passed on to the next higher
node, p is the prediction passed to this node from below, q is
the value predicted by the model at this node, n is the number
of cases that reach the node below, and k is a smoothing
constant (default value 15).
3.3 Dispatching control
Once a job is released into the shop floor, its progress
through the shop is controlled by the particular dispatching
rule in use at the time. In this dispatching rule, a job that is
critical and hasn’t yet been processed atthe bottleneck work
centre is chosen. If there is a tie, the job with the smallest
slack time is selected, and if then there is still a tie, then the
job with the shortest processing time is chosen. This
dispatching control is as an assistant to support CSCO to give
priority to those jobs that might increase the final customer
order throughput time when a work centre becomes idle and
to synchronize the progress of jobs in the shop that belong to
the same order.
4. EXPERIMENTATION
This section is to describe how to evaluate the
effectiveness and robustness of the CSCO in improving the
customer order flow time. In this section the simulation
model, experimental design, and performance measure used
to study the performance of the CSCO are discussed.
4.1 Simulation model
The following is a description of two general job shop
environments modeled in the simulation. Two shops, one
simple and one complex, are made up of six machines
(Machine #1 to Machine #6 in Table 1) and ten machines
(Machine #1 to Machine #10 in Table 1), respectively,
consistent with the many related studies that are usually in the
range of 4 to 10 machines.
In the simple model, each order generated consists of
between one and five individual jobs, and the number of
operations of each job is uniformly distributed between one
and six. In the complex model, each order generated consists
of between one and eight individual jobs, and the number of
operations of each job is uniformly distributed between one
and ten. The processing time for a job at work centre j in our
simulation study is randomly generated from uniform(0.9ptj,
1.1ptj), where ptj is the mean processing time of a job at work
centre j. The inter-arrival times of orders are generated from a
Poisson distribution and are determined using a preliminary
experiment in which the bottleneck station utilization is
nearly 95%, which represents a heavy shop load. In this study,
the order due date is set by the adjusted TWK rule, as used in
1323

FT.
2. PRD-FCFS and PRD-EDD outperform all other
combinations in terms of WTFG and FGI. These results are
similar to those found in the work of Moreira and Alive
(2006) in which the time period an order spends in the
warehouse of finished goods waiting to be delivered, can
be reduced if PRD is used. But, the scheduling
combinations with PRD result in the poor performances:
they result in the larger customer order flow time. In fact,
PRD makes all jobs equally critical, which increases the
completion time of the last job of a customer order.
3. Here, it is seen that CSCO is slightly longer than
PRD-EDD and PRD-FCFS when looking at WTFG and FGI,
but it is better than other scheduling combinations of order
releasing policies and dispatching rules. The results from
the simulation experiments also indicate that the CSCO
minimizes COFT, FT as well as WIP. These results is in
agreement with our research idea of presenting the CSCO
that combines the concepts of the CONWIP and PRD
policies to result in less WIP and shorter order waiting time
in the warehouse, so as to improve the customer order flow
time.
4. It seems that CSCO allows a deep cut in the values of FT,
WIP, FGI and WTFG even though it’sOLT is only slightly
longer than the best combination, IMR-EDD. This may
result in a considerable reduction in stock keeping and
work-in-process costs without increasing the OLT.
5. By comparing CSCO with the scheduling combinations
with PRD policy, it can be concluded that classifying jobs
into two subsets, critical and non critical, to release them
leads to an improvement of COFT, OLT, FT and WIP.
Because common job streams were used to generate the
10 observations in each cell, the sample observations were
not independent. As a result, it was essential to use a paired
statistics test (the paired t-test) to detect significant statistical
differences in the performance of each pair of scheduling
combinations. The complete set of results of statistical
analysis could not be presented for lack of space and also
because the other results were not substantially different from
what we currently presented. Therefore, for four performance
measures (OLT, FT, COFT, and WIP+FGI) the paired t-tests
were conducted to examine whether there was a significant
difference between CSCO and the other five scheduling
combinations that were superior to the remaining ones. In
order to achieve an experiment-wise confidence level of 95%,
we used the Bonferroni approach to control each confidence
level for each comparison. Table 5 represents the results of
the paired t-tests. The scheduling combinations in this table
are listed in descending order of performance. They are
grouped into homogeneous subsets labeled with a different
letter if the difference between the means of performance
measure of the two methods in the subset is not significantly
beyond the prescribed α level. For example, in the simple 
shop, CSCO and IMR-EDD display very similar OLT
performance (as they are labeled by A), whereas IMR-FCFS
labeled with B, performs significantly better than others.
In terms of the OLT, the paired t-test does not identify
significant differences among IMR-EDD and our proposed
system, CSCO. In addition, both of them are significantly
better than the other four scheduling combinations. We
further compared CSCO with five traditional scheduling
combinations to see if the proposed system provides and
advantage over traditional combinations for FT, COFT, and
WIP+FGI. As expected, CSCO dominated all other
scheduling combinations in terms of FT, COFT, and
WIP+FGI, whether it was in the simple shop or in the
complex shop. It is important to note that these improvements
were gained without significantly increasing the value of OLT,
which was sufficiently large to suggest the potential for
significant benefits in practice. This effectively reduces the
FT in the form of WIP, and the COFT in the form of
WIP+FGI.
6. CONCLUSION
While most research works have been done on the COS
problem regarding the dispatching and due date assignment
rules, relatively few attempts were made to study the relative
performances of order releasing policies. In addition, in an
order-based production system a measure, customer order
flow time (COFT), is important because it shows how long
the order is in the shop and in the finished goods warehouse.
So, it could be considered a good surrogate measure for
controlling the cost, including the work-in-process and the
finished goods inventory. This study was an attempt to
compare the relative performances (especially for COFT) of
scheduling combinations of order releasing policies and
dispatching rules in two order-based job shop environments.
A new scheduling system, Coordinated Scheduling of
Customer Orders (CSCO), was introduced as a way of
controlling the job release and synchronizing of the
within-order jobs in order to reduce the customer order flow
time.
CSCO and a total of 15 benchmarking scheduling
combinations were considered for a performance analysis in
this study. Systematic computer simulation was used as a
research tool. Overall, CSCO has been shown to be very
effective in minimizing COFT. Although IMR with the EDD
dispatching rule performs best in minimizing OLT, there is no
significant difference between CSCO and IMR-EDD for OLT.
The experimental results also indicate that CSCO
significantly minimizes FT as well as WIP+FGI. In summary,
CSCO is very effective at controlling the release of
within-order jobs, in which the non critical job is not released
to the shop if it is expected to be too early. It was also evident
that CSCO can indeed synchronize the within-order jobs to be
