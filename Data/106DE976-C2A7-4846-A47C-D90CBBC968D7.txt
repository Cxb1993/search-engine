摘要 
  隨著全球暖化，為了減少溫室氣體排放，許多替代性能源也紛紛被提出，而生質酒精燃料也
是其中之一。但當酒精和水組成為 95.6wt％時，在 1atm 和 78.2℃下會產生共沸點，相較於傳統
萃取蒸餾或共沸蒸餾的分離方式，變壓吸附分離酒精和水的混合物為一種較節能的分離程序。本
研究利用數值模擬之方式，針對水與酒精的氣態混合物經過三塔九步驟之製程進行模擬，此外，
也選擇了進料溫度、進料壓力、排氣壓力、第二階段高壓產氣時間與產氣加壓時間等操作條件進
行實驗設計之分析，而最後我們則利用模擬之結果針對乙醇的濃度跟回收率進行迴歸。 
 
Abstract-Because of the global warming, more and more energy alternatives have been announced to cut 
down the release of green house gases, and bio-ethanol is one of them. However, ethanol-water mixture 
has an azeotrope with the composition of 95.6wt％ ethanol at 78.2℃ and 1atm. By contrast, Pressure 
Swing Adsorption process (PSA process) of separating ethanol-water mixture is more energy saving 
than traditional separation methods such as distillation or extraction. In this study, numerical skill is 
used to simulate the PSA process of segregating ethanol and water gas mixture, and a 3-bed and 9-step 
PSA process is studied. Besides, several operation variables, such as feed temperature, feed pressure, 
vent pressure, the 2nd step time and production time are chosen to carry out Design of Experiment 
(DOE). In the last part, the simulation results are utilized to find the regression relationships for ethanol 
purity and recovery.

Simo(2008) 模擬絕熱系統下雙塔變壓吸附程序，將含水酒精從 92w% 提高到 99.5w% 以上。

此外本模擬在絕熱系統中進行，表示吸附床不與外界作熱交換，所以令吸附床和外界的熱傳項為
零。 
 本研究考慮質傳阻力，則氣固兩相間的平衡機構採用線性驅動模式（linear driving force 
model,LDF），在模擬時使用的數學模式有下列假設： 
(1) 氣體在吸附劑上的平衡吸附量採用 Langmuir 等溫吸附平衡關係式。 
(2) 理想氣體定律適用。 
(3) 僅考慮軸向的濃度和溫度梯度。 
(4) 因本研究所用的吸附劑粒徑較大，所以忽略壓力降。 
(5) 採用絕熱操作 
由文獻 Carmo and Gubulin (2002) 所得到的 extended Langmuir 等溫線吸附平衡關係式如

（三）Regression analysis 
本研究接著利用了Linear and quadratic model 進行fitting，因為我們利用dummy variable
來製造出 orthogonal polynomial，所以我們把變數丟掉或加入並不會影響迴歸得到的係數跟
p-value。 
Table 4 是我們從酒精濃度迴歸中選出影響較大的變數的結果，而我們亦可從中得到下面之
公式： 
Purity=98.80028807+0.038209877×P1(A)+0.028497942×P2(A)+0.138457×P1(B) 
-0.125535×P2(B)-0.11457×P1(C)-0.15576×P2(C)-0.02154×P1(D) 
-0.01903×P2(D)+0.039877×P1(E)+0.31646×P2(E)-0.014815×P11(A,B) 
+0.016389×P11(A,C)+0.0163889×P11(A,D)-0.01435×P11(B,E) 
    同理，我們也從 Table 5 中得到迴歸後的酒精回收率公式，我們可以發現酒精回收率的回歸
公式不太受交乘項，即我們只需要主效應項就可以表示酒精回收率的公式： 
Recovery=96.9173-0.03642×P1(A)+0.021152×P2(A)+0.96302×P1(B) 
+1.15047×P2(B)-0.11734×P1(C)+0.28808×P1(D)+0.23146×P2(D) 
+0.10886×P2(E)+0.06759×P11(D,E) 
 
( 
 
，Mx 為三個水準中的中間水準而 Lx 則是每個 level 間的差距，例如產氣加壓時間的三個水準分
別為25s、30s跟 35s所以 Mx為 25而 Lx則是 5，而 P11項則為兩個主效應相乘之結果，例如P11(D,E)
即為 P1(D)和 P1(E)相乘之結果。)  
（四）Comparison the optimal results between minitab and simulation program 
     在本研究的最後我們比較了在最佳化製程設定下的結果，其結果如 Table 6 所示，我們可以
發現酒精濃度有較準確的預測結果，而酒精回收率因為有略為 heavy tail 的情況發生，故 minitab
的預測與模擬的結果會有較大的誤差。 
計畫成果自評 
   本研究除了利用數值的模擬方式找到了符合無水酒精條件下可以達到更高回收率的製程，此
外也透過實驗設計方式分析了進料壓力、進料溫度、排氣壓力、第二步驟時間跟產氣加壓時間對
於酒精濃度跟回收率的影響，並利用 Linear and quadratic model 迴歸出酒精濃度跟回收率之公
式，這些結果對於將來實際利用 PSA 之方式分離酒精與水之製程有很大幫助。

ABSTRACT 
The pressure swing adsorption (PSA) process for the separation of ethanol-water 
mixtures with 3A molecular sieves was studied. Three types of PSA process, a two-bed 
four-step process, a two-bed six-step process including purge step, and a two-bed 
eight-step process including purge step and backfill step with adiabatic system were 
investigated. The two-bed eight-step process achieves the best of 99.5 wt% ethanol and 
the associated recovery was 96.2%. The feed pressure was 3.4014 atm, operating 
temperature was 423.14 K, and the vacuum pressure was 0.1 atm. Non-isothermal 
system and adiabatic system were discussed for the two-bed eight-step PSA process. 
The simulation results showed that non-isotherm system didn't perform better than 
adiabatic system, but consumed more energy than adiabatic system. The two-bed 
eight-step process with adiabatic system was better for anhydrous alcohol production. 
The effects of the operating variables, such as feed pressure, adsorber length, vacuum 
pressure and step time on the ethanol purity and the ethanol recovery were studied.  
Introduction 
Ethanol was produced from sugar or starch by hydrolysis and fermentation, and it 
usually contained large excess of water. However, the mixture of ethanol and water has 
an azeotropic point which contains 95.6 wt% ethanol at 78.2℃ and 1 atm. To obtain 
pure ethanol, extractive or azeotropic distillation unit which was high energy consuming 
was utilited to break the azeotrope traditionally. Comparing with the traditional ones, 
membrane and adsorption methods have recently been suggested as promising 
alternative processes for producing anhydrous alcohol.  
In recent years, the use of different types of molecular sieve and biobased adsorbents on 
separation of ethanol-water mixture has become important due to less energy 
consumption and high separation efficiency. The adsorbent could be divided into the 
organic type and inorganic type. So far, dehydration by adsorption on the molecular 
sieve had been widely used for the separation of commercial process. Al-Asheh et al. 
(2004) studied the separation of ethanol-water mixture using molecular sieves and 
biobased adsorbents. Molecular sieve of type 3A gave the best results in terms of 
breakthrough time and average outlet water concentration compared with 4A and 5A 
Because molecular diameter of water is 0.28 nm, it could easily penetrate zeolite 3A. 
However, the diameter of ethanol is 0.44nm so that ethanol molecule was not adsorbed 
(Teo et al., 1986). Carton et al. (1987) carried out the adsorption of water on 3A 
molecular sieve, in order to obtain anhydrous ethanol, in vapor phase and liquid phase. 
The results show that breakthrough curves were favorable in vapor phase and treating 
capacity of water in vapor phase was higher than in liquid phase. 
Carmo and Gubulin (2002) studied, in experiments, ethanol-water separation in a 
small-scale PSA process with 3A zeolite and the fitted empirical equations was shown 
to be satisfactory. Guan and Hu (2003) have simulated numerically the dehydration of 
93.54 wt% ethanol and 6.46wt% water in a rapid pressure swing adsorption (RPSA) 
process by the electrical analogue model. Simo et al. (2008) had simulated numerically 
a two-bed PSA to raise the ethanol purity.

KLDF was estimated by including both external fluid film mass transfer term and 
macropore diffusion term.  
According to the work of Simo et al. (2008), the macropore diffusion was the rate 
controlling step. The effective diffusivity  Deff contained molecular diffusion, which 
was the main transport mechanism within the molecule sieve pore, and Knudsen 
diffusion, which was especially important at low pressure condition. 
The external fluid film mass transfer was especially important at the desorption step. 
The external mass transfer coefficient Kf was gained from equation by Wakao and 
Funazlri (1978). The value of axial dispersion coefficient was estimated by equation 
from Wen and Fan (1975) .The pressure difference between two units could be used to 
calculate the flow rate between units. The valve equation offered by Fluid Controls 
Institute, Inc was utilized to calculate the flow rates at unit ends. 
At the beginning of calculation, the bed length was divided into equal spacing to mark 
the basic grid points, and the points were given the initial conditions, such as 
concentration, temperature, and pressure. Extra grid points were dynamically added 
when sharp wave front was observed in simulation. The system of partial differential 
equations (PDEs) was converted to a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with 
respect to time by the method of lines. The spatial derivatives of concentration and 
temperature at every basic grid point were evaluated by finite difference; flow rates at 
every basic grid point and the spatial derivatives of pressure in the adsorbers were 
estimated by cubic spline approximation. The integration of concentration, temperature, 
and pressure with respect to time in the bed is done by the program LSODE from the 
package of ODEPACK. The simulation was stopped when the system reaches cyclic 
steady state. The details of calculation method were showed in Chou and Huang (1994).  
Results and discussion  
To confirm the accuracy of our model, the simulation program was verified by 
comparison with the results of Simo et al. (2008) in Table 1. Average feed flow rate and 
ethanol purity were very close in both data as shown in Table 1.

The PSA process  
Threes types of PSA process were simulated to investigate the process performance, a 
two-bed four-step process, a two-bed six-step process, and a two-bed eight-step process 
with adiabatic system, as shown in figure1. For every process, all the valve values and 
operating variables were fixed and cycle time was set to 600 sec. The pressure drop of 4 
steps, 6 steps, and 8 steps are estimated to be 0.04768, 0.04991, and 0.04929atm,

The boiling point of ethanol and 
water were 379.44 K and 411.47 
K at 3.4014 atm, respectively 
(Perry et al., 1984). Two kinds 
of systems were tested, 
non-isothermal and adiabatic. 
The heat transfer coefficient (h) 
was equal to 4.6532 J/K-m2-s 
between the bed and 
surrounding in the 
non-isothermal system. 
As shown in Figure 3, the 
purity, recovery, productivity, 
and all average flow rates are 
almost the same between both 
systems. Therefore, it’s 
concluded that non-isotherm 
system doesn’t perform better 
than adiabatic system, but 
needs more energy to maintain 
a high surrounding temperature. 
The eight-step process with 
adiabatic is the best. The 
influences of operating 
variables on the process are 
discussed below. 
Effect of feed pressure 
Base on the eight-step process 
with adiabatic system, we 
continued to discuss the effect 
of feed pressure on the process 
performance, as shown in 
Figure 4 and Figure 5. The 
purity of ethanol decreases 
from 99.52 wt% to 99.25 wt% 
when feed pressure increased 
from 2.4014 atm to 4.4014 
atm.  
Although the purity decreased 
0.27 wt% slightly as the feed 
pressure increased, average 
product flow rate increased from 107231 L/min (STP) to 198772 L/min (STP), and the 
recovery increased from 95.92 % to 96.46 % as the feed pressure increased from 2.4014 
atm to 4.4014 atm. 
The average product flow rate, ethanol purity, and adsorbent weight had an important 
effect on the productivity. From Figure 4 and Figure 5, as the feed pressure increased, 
product flow rate and purity showed the opposite change at the same adsorbent weight. 
The variation of purity was small, so that productivity followed mainly with the change 
of average product flow rate to increase with increasing feed pressure.

wt% to 99.49 wt% by reducing vacuum pressure from 0.4 atm to 0.1 atm. Figure3 
indicated that the water adsorption amount decreased rapidly at low pressure. Molecular 
sieve at lower vacuum pressure condition could desorb more water than at higher 
vacuum pressure, so the adsorbents could adsorb more amount of water later at 
adsorption step, while means a lower water content in gas.  
The recovery increased 
slightly from 96.10 % to 
96.20 % as the vacuum 
pressure decreased from 0.4 
atm to 0.1 atm. Not only the 
purity but also the average 
feed flow rate increased 
dramatically as the vacuum 
pressure decreases. At the 
same time, the difference in 
the average product flow rate 
between the highest and the 
lowest vacuum pressure only 
reduced 471 L/min (STP). 
Therefore, the above results 
would cause the recovery to tend slightly upwards as vacuum pressure decreased from 
0.4 atm to 0.1 atm.  
Effect of production time 
The effect of production time 
on the process performance 
was shown in Figure 10 and 
Figure 11. The purity 
decreases from 99.55 wt% to 
99.44 wt% as production time 
increase from 235 sec to 275 
sec. When the production 
time increased, the water 
concentration wave front 
moved toward the top of bed 
and the bed utilization 
increased as well. However, 
the adsorbents were still not 
fully used at production time 
of 275sec.  Therefore, the 
ethanol purity only 
decreases slightly as 
production time increased. 
Although the average feed 
flow rate increases as the 
production time increased, 
the difference between 235 
sec and 275 sec was only 
214 L/min (STP). However, 
the average product flow 
rate increases 1430 L/min 
(STP). Accordingly, the 
recovery increased slightly
