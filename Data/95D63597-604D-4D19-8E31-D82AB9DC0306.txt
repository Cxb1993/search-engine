Abstract 
Proceeding from the 3-years research plan, 
the Study of Story-telling in Visual Design and 
Product Design, this second-year, from 
designer’s position, focuses on “Visual 
expression of story-telling in teaching 
experiment”. To help designers developing 
visual storyness, the research adopted the 
research method of teaching experiment, 
consensus assessment techniques, and learning 
satisfaction evaluation and proved the 
experimental students made better performance 
with significant differences showed on paired 
t-test on most of criteria in “creativity” and “Ads 
communication and emotion reaction” than 
control students. The result of teaching 
experiment and creative tips have proven to help 
designers to present the visual storyness on 
products design procedure and advertisement 
layout to impress the audiences an interesting 
and special experience.

INTRODUCTION 
Sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit maneuvers have been considered to be one of the most 
challenging movements elderly people encounter in their daily life (Manchoundia et 
al. 2006), and many fall accidents occur during these movements.  Lehtola et al. 
(2006) reported, after a two-year observation of 555 elders (the average age is 85), 
that 12% of falls occurred during the daily routines of standing up and sitting down.  
It has been observed that elderly subjects experienced difficulties moving in and out 
of a chair (Kao and Huang, 2008), and therefore it is crucial to design a chair that 
can assist elders to safely stand up and sit down from a chair.  Kao and Huang (2008) 
also proposed a chair design that uses an assistive device installed underneath the 
seat to support part of the user’s weight and to minimize the pressure on his/her 
lower body.  This study aims to test the effectiveness of that chair design. 
THE ASSISTIVE CHAIR DESIGN 
This design concept is to support the user through an air pump installed underneath 
the seat.  This air pump is controlled by a handle installed on the right arm of the 
chair.  When the user sits down or rises up, s/he can naturally press the handle to 
activate the air pump.  Different from other conventional designs in the market that 
uses a slippery sloped seat, this proposed design (see Figure 1) divides the seat into 
two pieces that are connected by a hinge.  In the rising position, the seat maintains a 
rather flat surface and offers users better support. The seat is 50 cm in width, 44cm 
in depth, and 42 cm in height.  The armrest is placed 21 cm above the seat, and the 
back is located 34.5 cm above the seat.  The seat and back are padded with 3 cm of 
thick sponge and fabric.  After a 2-cm sponge compression, the actual sitting height 
is approximately 40 cm. 
METHODS 
To test the feasibility of the design, two similar prototypes were made with a minor 
difference: one has the assistive device installed under the chair (chair A) while the 
other one (chair B) does not.  Subjects were asked to test both models in random 
order. 
SUBJECT 
Twenty-two volunteers were selected from the researcher’s neighborhood at a 
community park near Minquan West Road MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) Station in 
Taipei, Taiwan.  Two age groups were recruited into the subject poll to test the age 
difference. The selection criteria were: (1) people over 65 years old who could 
handle daily routines independently, and (2) people between 55 and 64 years old 
who had experienced discomfort in their waist or knees. 
recorded.  At the same time, the subjects’ movements were videotaped by a digital 
camera for later analysis.  The test adopted the definition for sit-to-stand movement 
stated by Hong (1994).  The start of sit-to-stand movement was defined as the 
moment subject’s bottom moved away from the chair as he or she leaned forward.  
The end of the movement was defined as the moment the subject’s body stretched 
upright during the stretching movement.  Prior to testing, the subjects could practice 
as many times as they wanted until they felt comfortable to do the test. 
After the test, subjects were asked to pick a chair they felt to be more 
comfortable and explain the reasons behind their choice.  The tests were observed 
carefully and videotaped for further analysis.   
OUTCOME MEASURES AND DATA ANALYSIS 
Still images of standing-up and sitting-down movements were extracted from the 
videos for analysis. AutoCAD 2006 was used to measure the leaning-forward angles 
on the pictures.  The leaning angle was defined as the angle between the trunk and 
vertical plane (see Figure 3).  SPSS 12 was used to analyze the data.  The 
independent variables include: the existence of assistive mechanism, subjects’ age, 
stature, and weight; dependent variables include: subjective preference, time 
required, and the leaning angle during standing up and sitting down.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
BASIC DATA 
Twenty-two subjects aged between 55 and 84 were recruited for the test.  The test 
was conducted during October 20 – 29, 2008, and the basic data is summarized in 
Table 1.  
RESULTS ON RISING UP 
Subjective Preference 
Eighteen out of 22 subjects (more than 80%) thought chair A helped them get up 
easier than chair B (Table 3).  Four subjects thought chair A and chair B made no 
difference in helping them getting up from the chair. Among these four, three 
subjects expressed that they felt no difference because their good health and agility 
allowed them to get up easily; the other subject, a 78-year-old man weighing 78 
kilograms, however, said that the pushing force from the assistive device was 
inadequate in supporting his weight and therefore he felt no difference between the 
two chairs. This may lead to a hypothesis that the pushing force of the assistive 
device needs to be calibrated according to the user’s weight.  This needs to be 
investigated further.

Time used for rising from chair 
The time needed for the respondents to rise up from the tested chairs A and B are 
summarized in Table 4. 
 
Table 4 Time Used for Rising up from Chair A and B (sec.) 
CHAIR N MIN. MAX. MEAN S.D. 
A 22 2.91 4.16 3.44 .29 
B 22 1.40 3.25 2.45 .50 
 
The average time used for the respondents to rise from chair A was 3.44 seconds 
while from chair B was 2.45 seconds – a significant difference of almost 1 second 
(p=0.000). The standard deviation for chair A (0.29) is lower than that of chair B 
(0.50).  This more evenly distribution of time may be caused by the assistive device 
on chair A provided subjects an extra force to support themselves from rising up 
from the chair.  However, the assistive device might have slowed down the sit-to-
stand process. 
Some literatures suggested that elders may adopt the speed strategy to enable 
themselves to stand up easily from the chair.  They may lean their trunks forward to 
gain speed without sacrificing safety while getting up from the chair. Pai (1991) 
pointed out that increasing speed in rising from a chair may increase the torque on 
hips, knees and ankles.  In addition, because their declined lower limb strength, 
RESULTS ON SITTING DOWN 
Subjective Preference 
Nineteen of the 22 subjects said that chair A was easier to sit on than chair B (Table 
6).  Only 3 subjects preferred chair B to chair A.  Among them, two were in their 
mid-old age (55-64) and thought the assistive device in chair A was unnecessary to 
them because they were healthy enough to manage sitting down.  The third subject 
failed to sit down on chair A because she was too light (36 kilograms) and failed to 
activate the assistive device.  The air pump in the assistive device needed at least 50 
kilograms of weight to activate.

Trunk Angle for Sitting Down 
The trunk angles for sitting down are summarized in Table 7.  To avoid falling back 
into the chair, the subject had to lean his/her trunk further ahead to maintain 
stability.  The smaller the trunk angle the more beneficial it is for the body.  The 
average trunk angle for chair A (33.31 ﾟ) is significantly (p=0.000<0.05) smaller 
than that of chair B (38.90 ﾟ).    The lifted seat in chair A supports the subject’s 
bottom so that s/he doesn’t have to lean forward as much (Figure 5).  Compared to 
standing up from a chair, sitting down on a chair is a much more complicated and 
unstable movement for the elderly because lower limbs are usually weaker (Dubost 
et al, 2005).

and agility of the users could be included to pinpoint the target market of 
this assistive device. 
2. The measuring method. A more precise device, e.g. motion capture system, 
can be used for capturing and measuring subjects’ movements. 
3. The pushing force of the air pump can be considered as a factor in the 
study.
