Abstract 
This paper presents a new approach using fuzzy compensator and PID controller to an experimental 
propeller setup which is called the twin rotor multi-input multi-output system (TRMS). Some previous works 
ignored the interactions between two axes and the controller being designed in horizontal or vertical 
direction separately. The goal of this study is to stabilize the TRMS in significant cross coupling conditions 
and to experiment with set-point control and trajectory tracking. The fuzzy compensator and PID controller 
design is performed by a real-valued genetic algorithm (RGA) with system performance index as fitness 
function. We apply the integral of time multiplied by the square error criterion (ITSE) to form a suitable 
fitness function in the RGA. Simulation results show that the proposed design can successfully adapt system 
nonlinearity and complex coupling conditions. 
 
1  Introduction 
 
Over the past two decades, there has been growing interest in using fuzzy logic for control systems. 
Many industrial research works have supported the development of fuzzy controllers. The fuzzy controller, 
which does not need precise mathematical system models, is suitable to solve nonlinear or complex problems. 
Juang [1]-[2] utilized a fuzzy modeling system on aircraft automatic landing controls with wind disturbance. 
Zhang [3] optimized the input/output membership functions for a nonlinear dynamic system by Extended 
Kalman Filter. Lu [4] used the genetic algorithm to tune the membership functions of a fuzzy controller for 
smart structure systems with the requirement of vibration control. It is independent from the expert’s 
knowledge to adjust parameters of fuzzy controller to improve performance. Hwang [5] presented the 
elements of procedure for designing optimal fuzzy controllers using genetic algorithm. It is an unsupervised 
learning method that requires less effort than traditional methods that are based on prior information. Among 
them, the genetic algorithm played a key role in parameter adjustment. In [6], Park mentioned that 
parameters of successful fuzzy control system were always decided subjectively and presented a genetic base 
learning mechanism to adjust the parameters for fuzzy reasoning models automatically. Base on this idea, 
Hagras [7] reported a robot system that allowed the fuzzy membership functions for behavior co-ordination 
to be learned on line with GA. In [8], the system performance index is used for building fitness functions in 
GA and is formed by integral of time multiplied by the square error criterion (ITSE). It is an optimization for 
parameters tuning of the control system, which is suitable for evolution computation. 
Controller design of the TRMS has been studied for years. Huang and Juang [9]-[10] investigated the 
effect of the binary genetic algorithm (BGA) on controller tuning for improving system performance. The 
gains of the PID controller are tuned by BGA with a nonlinear control design scheme. The controllers are 
better than the Gauss-Seidel Minimization Procedure. Tsai, Huang, and Juang [11] applied a real-valued 
genetic algorithm (RGA) on PID tuning to the TRMS control both in the vertical and horizontal axes 
separately. The system was decoupled into two parts, which are the vertical and horizontal, in order to design 
a one-degree-of-freedom PID controller. They restricted the connect beam between the main rotor and tail 
rotor to move only on the vertical or horizontal planes. The impact on the two rotors was ignored. The 
parameters of the PID controller are tuned by the RGA to reduce the total error and control energy. Fan and 
Juang [12] compared different kinds of fitness functions in the RGA via trial and error for tuning an optimal 
PID controller on the TRMS. The computer simulations showed that whether the fitness function suited the 
objective or was not significantly related to the result. In the conclusion of these papers [11]-[12], they 
constructed four PID controllers for the TRMS (both in the vertical and horizontal spherical surfaces 
simultaneously). Although these PID controllers could work in two degrees of freedom (2-DOF), they were 
still weak in tracking a desired trajectory and in reaching a specific attitude. It is difficult to stabilize the 
influence between two axes and a non-minimum phase in a vertical plane. Liu, Fan, and Juang [13], quoted 
the system performance index as a part of the fitness function in RGA. The system performance index deals 
with a modification of the known integral of time multiplied by square error criterion (ITSE). It is more 
efficient in finding the parameters of four PID controllers. Although these controllers could reduce control

Rotation of propeller produces an angular momentum which, according to the law of conservation of angular 
momentum, must be compensated by the remaining body of the TRMS beam. The results of the interactions 
between two transfer functions are represented by the moment of inertia of the motor with 
propellers hvJ and vhJ in Fig. 2. This interaction directly influences the velocity of the beam in both planes. The 
forces hF and vF multiplied by the length ( )vhl a  and vl are equal to the torques acting on the arm. Parameters 
in Fig. 1 are defined as follows: 
 
vh aa ,  horizontal and vertical position of TRMS beam. 
vh WW ,  horizontal and vertical angular velocity of TRMS beam.

3  System Performance Index 
 
A system performance index is used for fitness function in real-value typed Genetic Algorithms. It is an 
optimization criterion for parameters tuning of control system, which is suitable for RGA. It deals with a 
modification of the known integral of time multiplied by squared error criterion (ITSE). In order to influence 
a characteristic value of a signal, it is not necessary to add a special term to the ITSE which may increase the 
selection pressure in RGA. An evident possibility is to divide the integral criterion in a special error section 
for each characteristic value. The addition of integral sections to the time horizon is straight forward and 
always has the same unit. For example, the aim of control optimization is to determine the control parameters

Four PID controllers and four fuzzy compensators for TRMS are: PIDvv, PIDvh, PIDhv, PIDhh, FLCvv, 
FLCvh, FLChv, FLChh, where h denotes horizontal and v denotes vertical. The TRMS control in horizontal and 
vertical planes requires setting 28 subsystems’ parameters as shown in TABLE I. It is difficult to optimize 
these parameters simultaneously. Two cases are performed which are based on following setups:  Case I: 
optimize the parameters of each subsystem in horizontal and vertical in GA individually; Case II: use the 
results from Case I as initial generation in RGA and optimize all parameters simultaneously.

Case II: Optimizing the parameters of the cross-coupling controller and compensator 
   We used the results from Case I as a part of initial generation to minimize the search area. The other 
parameters Sehv, Scehv, Ssehv, Suhv, Sevh Scevh, Ssevh, Suvh, Kphv, Kihv, Kdhv, Kpvh, Kivh and Kdvh are 
generated randomly within the same range as in Case I. The population size is 40, crossover rate is 80% with 
Adewuya crossover law, and mutation rate is 2.5%. System requirements and fitness functions are the same 
as in Case I. Tuning results are in TABLE II. Simulation of the set-point control is shown in Fig. 13. 
Simulation time is 50 sec. the sampling time is 0.5 sec. Total sums of errors in horizontal and vertical are 
44.002 and 38.618 respectively. Compared to [13], as shown in Fig. 14, the new approach reduces the 
maximum overshoot, rise time and steady state time in the horizontal plane, and eliminates the oscillation 
and undershoot in the vertical plane. Simulations of trajectory tracking are shown in Fig. 15 and Fig. 16, 
where reference inputs are sine wave and square wave. The frequency is 1/40 Hz and the amplitudes are 0.5 
rad and 0.2 rad on the horizontal plane and the vertical plane, respectively. The total sum of errors of sine 
wave response on the horizontal plane is 4.377 and is 40.196 on the vertical plane. The total sums of errors of 
square wave response on the horizontal plane and the vertical plane are 34.906 and 73.246, respectively. 
Comparisons of this work and [13] are shown in TABLE III. Sine wave response improves at least 44%. 
Square wave response improves at least 26%.

6  Conclusion 
 
In this paper, the control problem of the TRMS is solved. The proposed control scheme utilizes a RGA 
with a specified system performance index to tune the parameters of the fuzzy compensator and PID 
controller, which can stabilize the cross-coupling nonlinear system. This approach has successfully overcome 
the influence of cross-coupling between two axes. In set-point control, it reduces maximum overshoot, rising 
time, steady state time and delay time. It is also more suitable for tracking a desired trajectory in horizontal 
and vertical planes simultaneously. Compared to previous works, the simulation results show that the new 
approach can reduce the total error and improve system performance.
