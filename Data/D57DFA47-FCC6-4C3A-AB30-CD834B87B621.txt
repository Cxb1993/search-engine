Abstract 
In this report, we propose a new prosody modeling method for Mandarin speech. It first 
employs a hierarchical prosody structure to describe the variations of prosodic features and the 
relationships between prosody tags, prosodic features, and linguistic features. An automatic joint 
prosody labeling and modeling algorithm is then developed. It can simultaneously label two types 
of prosody tags and train several prosodic models from a prosody-unlabeled speech corpus. The 
two types of prosody tags are 7-level inter-syllable break type and the prosodic state of syllable. 
The first type of prosody tag is used to construct a 4-level prosody hierarchy, while the second 
one is used to describe the patterns of constituents of the prosody hierarchy. These prosodic 
models describe the variations of prosodic features and model the relationships between prosody 
tags, prosodic features, and linguistic features. The effectiveness of the proposed method was 
confirmed by simulations using a large tree-bank speech corpus. 
After completing the prosody modeling study, we use it to analyze the effect of speaking 
rate on prosody variation. The study is based on a set of 4 parallel speech corpora with different 
speaking rates. The results are quite promising and will be used in TTS for speaking rate control. 
Several applications are then implemented. They include a novel tone recognizer, a learning 
system of the prosody of isolated Mandarin words, a prosody generator for Mandarin TTS, and a 
new prosody conversion method for Mandarin speech. The successes of these applications 
confirmed the usefulness of the proposed prosody modeling method.  
Keywords: Prosody Modeling, Prosody labeling, Mandarin prosody, Speaking rate control,

一、 研究背景及目的 
韻律信息是一種跨音段的語音特徵，它是人類用來協助交談的重要信息，缺少韻律語音
就變得單調而不易了解，韻律信息通常是載在語音的 pitch、energy、duration、pause 等參
數中，過去幾年 prosody modeling 是一個熱門的研究題目，主要是探討語言之詞、語法結
構和韻律信息變化之間的關係，研究之議題包括如何由語言參數預測 breaks 或 prosodic 
phrase boundaries、prosodic cues labeling、prosodic phrase 之 pitch contour model 建立、
prosody hierarchy 之建構等，其中在由語言參數預測 breaks 的研究中，大都採用先以人工
標記各層次的 breaks，再由文句中抽取語言參數，以統計法或類神經網路做兩者 mapping 
的做法，目前研究主要的缺點是以人工處理大量語料會有標記 inconsistency 的問題，另外
的缺點是使用的語言參數大多只含和字、詞組結構有關的低階語言參數。 
在  prosody hierarchy 建構的研究主要是對  pitch contour 的變化進行探討，使用
intermediate及I ntonational phrases 兩個層次的架構，探討語法結構和此兩類 prosodic 
phrases 之關係。中文方面，過去趙元任先生曾提出 “ripple over wave” 的結構，其中 wave 
是指 intonation 的高到低下降效應，ripple 是指音節的 tone patterns 的 local variation；近
年來，中研院鄭秋豫博士更提出增加更高一層的 “waves in a tide” 基頻軌跡架構(見圖1)，
她提議由多個像 waves 的 prosodic phrases 組成一個像 tide 的 prosodic phrase group，整
個 prosodic phrase group 是人用來敘述一整個事件，會以一個含 reset 現象的 prosodic 
phrase 開始，而以一個含較小 reset 的 prosodic phrase 結束。鄭博士使用一個包含許多長
文語音的 database 做研究，由人工作 break 的標記及 prosodic phrase 類別標示，再使用
統計法做分析得到各層次 prosodic phrase patterns。 
 
圖 1: “waves in a tide” 基頻軌跡架構[1] 
 
另外，相關的研究是 prosody modeling 在 TTS 及語音辨認的應用，其中在TTS 的應
用上，過去有許多方法被提出來，希望建立一個由 text 的 linguistic features 對應至 speech 
的 prosodic features 的模式，以便由輸入文句產生適切的韻律信息，進而合成流利自然的語
音，主要方法包括統計式及類神經網路兩類做法。另一方面，在 Automatic speech recognition 
(ASR) 的應用，則希望由輸入語音中抽取 prosodic features 以協助辨認，過去雖然有些方法
被提出來，用以提供 long pause 位置、詞邊界、韻律狀態等信息，以加快辨認速度或提高
字或聲調辨認率，但提出方法的 prosody modeling 仍不夠好，以至於對語音辨認之協助仍
極有限，因此 prosody modeling for speech recognition 仍是一個值得深入研究的題目。 
我們過去對 prosody modeling 有許多研究，包括早期使用 Recurrent neural network 
(RNN) 來作TTS的韻律信息產生[2,3]、使用RNN 偵測語音之韻律狀態以協助聲調辨認
[4,5]、使用RNN 偵測語音之可能詞邊界[6]以協助詞之辨認、使用統計法作音節長度之 
modeling[7]、以及的統計式音節 pitch contour models[8,9]。本計畫以過去所提出的 prosody 
 3
PLM)[50,51]，對於語料庫同時進行自動韻律標註以及建立韻律結構，除此之外，韻律結構和
語言參數間的關係也同時被建立，完整地考慮韻律模型的各面向，使韻律訊息能廣泛應用於
語音處理的各子領域[52-59]且改善不同應用之效能。 
 
三、 研究方法及成果 
本計劃的研究架構如圖 2所示，可分為三大主軸，分別為(1)韻律模型的建立、(2)不同
語料韻律分析、以及(3)韻律模型的應用，首先我們以之前提出的統計式韻律模型[7-9]為基
礎，引入音節間的連音效應及簡單的韻律階層，進而產生進階統計式韻律模型，且應用在聲
調辨認以及中文韻律學習系統。為了自動建構韻律結構，接著我們提出「非監督式韻律標記
及韻律模式模型」，此方法著重在 modeling 音高、音節間的停頓以及韻律階層的關係，在
驗證此方法於朗讀式語音模擬的有效性後，我們延伸此方法同時建立音高、音長、音強、音
節間停頓以及韻律結構的關係，因此我們接著提出了「進階非監督式韻律標記及韻律模式模
型」，使韻律模型的建構更加完整。最後，以此完整的韻律模型分析不同語速之語流以及自
發性語音韻律，且應用於文字轉語音之韻律產生以及語者韻律轉換。各個子研究之研究方法
及結果將於後面各小節描述。

示的變化，相較於 f0 mean 觀察值在 prosodic phrase 邊界有更明顯的 f0 reset，而在 prosodic 
phrase裡面，韻律狀態的變化較 f0觀察值更為平滑，因此韻律狀態更能夠表示 prosodic phrase
的結構，可作為建立韻律結構的重要參數。另外，為了驗證此模型描述聲調和 prosodic phrase
的能力，我們將此模型進而應用於輔助傳統的聲調辨認，結果相當不錯，其內容將於稍後的
韻律模型的應用中介紹。

另外，除了考慮韻律架構外，在進階統計式韻律模型裡，我們也加入連音效應的影響因
素，我們先以單詞(isolated words)當做研究素材，探討不同連音狀態(或是韻律斷點型態)對
於音節音高的影響，其數學式表示如下：

其中 nsp 代表觀察到的 N 字詞的第 n 個音節的 log-F0 contour； rnsp 為 residual； ntβ 為聲調對
音高的影響參數(affecting pattern, AP)；
nw
β 為詞位置的 AP， {( , ) | 1 ~ 8, }nw i j i j i∈ = ≤ 表示在

(coarticulation state); ntp 為聲調序列 1 +1( , )nn n nt t t+ = ； 1 -1,n nfc tp−β  以及 ,n nbc tpβ  分別為  forward 
(carryover)以及 backward (anticipatory) 連音效應的 AP; pμ  為語者的音高平均值。值得注意
的是，此模型考慮了前後音節間聲調的影響，且影響的程度依據不同的連音狀態有所不同，

圖 6：音節基頻軌跡模型中受後一音節影響因素。其中實線(line)為連音狀態為「強」、虛線
(dash)為「中」、點(dots)為「弱」。第(i,j)項表示此音節為 tone i、後一音節為 tone j 的聲調組
合。 
 
在詞位置影響因素方面，一般認為在語調語言(Intonation language，如英文)中，一句連
續語音的基頻軌跡會隨著時間逐漸降低，並且在下一句話(Sentence)或韻律詞(Prosodic word)
的開始處躍升，此現象稱為 pitch reset。由我們的實驗結果發現，在中文單詞中也有類似的
現象，並將之模擬為音節在詞的位置之影響因素。如圖 7 所示，若音節在詞的前面部分則其
基頻軌跡較高，若音節在詞的後面則較低，並且有逐步下降的趨勢。此外我們發現一個有趣
的現象：對於同樣是詞首音節的影響因素而言，三字詞首比二字詞首還要高，四字詞首又比
三字詞高；至於詞尾音節則剛好相反。

主觀認定的不同造成標記結果的不一致。二、即使是同一個標記人進行標記，長時間的進行
下來，也難以保持一致性。三、耗時。上述之不一致性，進而可能使得已建構之韻律模型在
語音處理應用上的表現不佳。 
為了改善傳統韻律標記以及韻律模式的缺點，引入進階統計式模型裡的韻律階層及連音
效應的觀念，我們設計出一個統計式的中文韻律模型，以此模型自動化地對於未經韻律標示
的語料庫同時進行韻律標記以及建構韻律模型，這些待標示的韻律標記為 break indices 以
及 prosodic state，其中 break indices 表示了韻律單元的邊界，而 prosodic state 代表上層韻
律單元的 pitch level 變化，換言之，利用 break indices 以及 prosodic state 便可以表示韻
律架構之變化，本研究採用之韻律架構為由中研院鄭秋豫博士所提出之 HPG [62]進而修改
之架構（如圖 8 所示），其中 B4、B3 以及 B2 分別代表 BG/PG、PPh 以及 PW 的邊界，B1
和 B0 分別代表 normal syllabic 邊界及連音邊界，B2 進而分成兩個類別：B2-1 以及 B2-2
分別代表 pitch reset 及 short pause 之 PW 邊界。

為了驗證及比較人工標記和我們提出的自動標記方法，十分之ㄧ的實驗語料庫，
經由交大外文系語音實驗室專業人員以 ToBI 標準進行韻律標記，比較兩種方法後，如
表 1 所示之 KL2 distances，發現到以我們提出之方法標記出來的 break indices 所對應
的 prosodic features 擁有較一致的統計特性，相較於傳統以人工標記 break indices 的
不一致統計特性，我們的模型更能真實地反映出語者之語音韻律特性。這樣的優點使
得我們提出之韻律模型能有別於傳統方法，且更適合應用於語音辨認及語音合成。另
外，經由分析 PW 與 lexical word (LW) 之對應關係，人工標記的結果有高達 69.7%的
PW 是直接對應到 LW，而自動標記之方法只有 40.0%的 PW-LW 對應，很明顯地，人
工標記傾向以 LW 基本的韻律單元，而不是客觀地以聲學信號為標記之標準，進而因
此造成標記結果的聲學信號分布不一致。

此模型訓練完成後，則可以用來對測試語料作自動 prosodic tag 標記，以預備將來應用
此核心技術於語音辨認，合成或語者辨認等多方面應用，圖 12 為一典型的自動標記範例，
從此範例可看出此模型的有效性。其中我們發現到 break 標記的位置與語法的邊界有明顯
的對應關係，另外 prosodic state 相對於 observed 的 pitch level 值，更能代表高階層的韻
律結構特性。

3.2 於不同語料之韻律分析 
3.2.1 不同語速語音韻律之探討 [58] 
研究語音韻律的文獻雖然很多，但是特別對於不同語速的討論相對較少，在過去，陶[63]
以方法 bottom-up 的方式建立不同語速之間韻律的轉換關係，從音節層次模擬快速之對話
語音和一般速度之朗讀語音的音高軌跡變化，忽略上層韻律結構的影響；而李[64]和鄭[65]
以階層式韻律架提供一個 top-down 的分析方式，事先以人工對語料庫標記韻律階層，然而
此研究方法較耗費人力與時間，語料庫的選擇上無法採用大量語料當做研究素材、樣本數的
不足、且加上人工標記造成的不一致性，以致研究結果可能不夠一般性。本研究利用所提出
之「非監督式韻律標記及韻律模式」，同時提供 bottom-up 和 top-down 的分析方式，盡可
能從各個不同面向討論相異語速語音之韻律變化，採用自動標記分析方法、同時兼顧採用大
量語料做研究，使研究結果更具一般性。 
本研究所採用的實驗語料，是由一位專業的女性播音員讀稿之快速、正常、中速及慢速
平行語料庫，此平行語料庫每種語速各含有 348 個音檔、48035 個音節，平均每秒音節數分
別是快速語料庫的 4.40 音節/秒、正常速度的 3.82 音節/秒、中速的 2.97 音節/秒以及慢速的
2.45 音節/秒，錄製順序是先錄正常語速，接下來才將其他三種速度錄製完成，語料庫的錄
製文字為 Sinica Treebank[60] 語料庫中選出的短篇文章，主要內容大多摘錄自新聞、網路文
章、國小教科書等，由數個句子所組成的段落。本研究分別對不同語速語料的訓練得到韻律
模型，藉由分析不同語速之韻律模型參數，我們探討了不同語速的韻律特性，包含：（1）
不同語速音節基頻軌跡之比較、（2）不同語速之 prosodic phrasing、（3）上層韻律單元的
patterns、以及（4）break 和語言參數的關係。其重要發現分述如下： 
（1）不同語速音節基頻軌跡之比較 
由不同語速的聲調影響參數分析，我們發現到越慢的語速聲調在 f0 contour 上的
表現較為完整，而越快語速的 f0 聲調變化較為不完整，且不同聲調 AP 間的相對距離
較近，比較失去個別聲調的獨特性。在連音效應方面，類似於聲調影響參數，較慢語速 
coarticulation patterns 較為明顯，反之，快速語音的連音 patterns 較不明顯。 
（2）不同語速之 prosodic phrasing 
雖然不同語速的平均語速有所差異，但是統計不同語速它們音節長的分布，可以發
現到平均值雖有不同，但變異量卻是差不多的，這樣的統計資訊似乎代表不同語速之間
的韻律，可以簡單用平均值的平移就可互相轉換，然而經由分析不同語速韻律斷點的分
佈，我們發現到越快語速使得韻律斷點的數目變少，反之，越慢的語音會插入較多的韻
律斷點，也就是說，語速越快韻律詞的平均長度越長，所以不同語速的韻律除了平均語
速的差異外，prosodic phrasing strategy 也是重要的差異。 
（3）上層韻律單元的 patterns

圖 13：本研究使用之中文自發性語音韻律階層式架構 
 
本研究重要成果統整如下： 
(1) 自發性語音的韻律變化較朗讀式語音更為複雜，音節層次在音高、音長和音量位準上的
變化貢獻度較朗讀式語音少很多，上層韻律單元的變化佔了重要的角色。 
(2) 自發性語音中的特殊現象音節，會較中文基本音節平均音長還要長許多，且有較低的能
量位準。 
(3) 經由韻律斷點和語言參數關係的建立，一些特殊的詞類對應到的韻律斷點特性，仍與朗
讀式語音的特性類似，如關係連接詞和代名詞等等。 
(4) 上層韻律單元的音高、音長和音量位準 pattern 也與朗讀式語音的類似，然而其不同長
度單元的 pattern 較有一致的特性。 
(5) 中斷點(interrupt point)大多對應到韻律斷點，且跨越這些 interrupt point 的韻律單元間，
有明顯的 f0 reset。 
(6)此韻律模型可進一步應用於自發性語音辨認的 task 中，期望能提供有效的韻律訊息輔
助辨認之正確。

3.3 韻律模型之應用 
3.3.1 聲調辨認之應用 [52] 
因聲調與上層韻律變化緊密結合且互相干擾，因此要有較好的聲調辨認率，需能移除
韻律狀態的干擾，因此我們使用進階統計式韻律模型來輔助聲調辨認器，將聲調和上層韻
律變化拆解。其架構如圖 14 所示，MLP tone recognizer 先給予韻律狀態標記器(LPM-based 
prosody state labeler) 聲調之 a posterior probability ( kT )，LPM-based prosody state labeler 藉
由進階統計式韻律模型(LPM)以韻律狀態模型 ( | )P p B 參數而得到韻律狀態(prosodic state)之  
a posterior probability ( kφ )， kφ 便含有 prosodic state 之資訊。 
 19
語料估計模型參數。以一套包含 107,936 個單詞的單一女性語者的語料庫訓練韻律模型，
並分析各種影響因素的物理意義和模式的誤差；實驗結果顯示此模型能有效描述此三種韻
律參數的變化，並提供了模擬連續語音韻律架構重要的參考資訊。 
在驗證此韻律模式的有效性後，我們使用它建立了一套中文韻律學習系統，介面如圖
15 所示，它提供非中文母語的使用者學習。使用者可依需要輸入單詞，系統會自動合成該
單詞之語音及顯示正確的三種韻律參數變化讓使用者模仿；並且在使用者由麥克風錄音後
進行語音切割、求取基頻軌跡和能量等處理，並提供使用者相關韻律資訊回饋學習。

3.3.2 韻律產生器之應用 [56] 
韻律產生在文字轉語音系統中扮演著重要的角色，最主要是建立語言參數和韻律參數
間的對應關係，由前人的研究歸納，韻律產生的方法最主要分為兩個流派： (1) direct 
modeling approach、以及(2) hierarchical prosody approach. Direct modeling 的方法直接利用
圖像辨識的工具建立由語言參數預估韻律參數的機制，常使用的圖像辨識工具包括類神經
網路[2,72]、模糊類神經[73]以及決策樹[74]等，此方法的優點為易於實作，但如果產生不適
當的韻律參數時，很難由圖像辨識工具的參數之中分析其錯誤的原因進而改善，且此方法
通常沒有考慮韻律的架構，且是以 bottom-up 的方式以每一個最小的韻律單位(通常是音
節、聲母、韻母、甚至是 HMM state)進行 modeling。而 hierarchical prosody approach 的方
法將韻律的變化描述成一個階層性的架構，此架構通常由下至上包含音節、韻律詞、韻律
片語、以及韻律句子，而這些階層的邊界由韻律斷點來決定，在進行韻律產生的時候，是

表 7 代表給定正確韻律斷點後韻律參數預估的 TRE 值，可以清楚的發現 TRE 會明顯
減少，代表韻律斷點的確會影響韻律參數預估的好壞。

圖 19：訓練階段之系統架構圖 
為了要使來源語者之說話韻律特性經由轉換之後能與目標語者之說話韻律特性相近，
本論文採用的方法為統計來源與目標語者之間韻律狀態以及停頓標記的對應關係，以此建
立韻律標記之轉換函式(prosody mapping function)。在建立韻律轉換函式，本研究提出兩種
方法，分別為轉換方法一與方法二。首先在方法一中，運用了高斯正規化的概念對來源與
目標的韻律參數以及韻律狀態建立對應關係，因此，此方法並不需要特別用到平行語料，
即可建立轉換函式；其次，在方法二則是以MMSE法則，建立來源以及目標韻律標記資訊
之間的轉換關係，此該方法必需要使用平行語料。 
在轉換階段，先將來源語音以音節為單位做切割，藉由切割位置抽取出韻律參數，同
時將語料文字抽取出語言參數；接著利用來源語者之韻律模型對輸入語音標記其韻律狀態
及停頓標記(source prosody tags)，之後即可將得到的標記資訊，透過轉換函式，得到預估的
目標語者韻律標記(target prosody tags)；最後，藉由預估得到的目標語者標記資訊以及目標
韻律模型還原音節基頻軌跡、音節長度以及音節能量位階，並利用目標語音原始之頻譜參
數，以 STRAIGHT 合成器合成轉換之聲音。

斯正規化轉換的效果為最差；方法一在相似度實驗中表現優於高斯混合模型，而在喜好度
實驗中卻剛好相反。

 MV GMM M_1 M_2
相似度(%) 13 16.5 26 44.5
喜好度(%) 11.5 18.5 15.5 54.5
  
由以上實驗結果證實，不管是客觀或主觀評估，以平行語料為基礎的轉換方法，方法二
之效果明顯優於以高斯混合模型為基礎的轉換；而以非平行語料為基礎的轉換方法之比較，
方法一亦優於高斯正規化轉換。我們也更進一步的定義語者的說話特性，發現在各種語者間
說話特性不一致的情況下，本研究所提出之方法仍優於傳統轉換方法，驗證了所提出韻律模
型的有效性。 
 
 
四、 計畫成果自評 
本計劃提出一個中文韻律自動標註及模式方法，是具創新性的做法，較現有的韻律模
式研究，有極大的進步。此韻律模式相當先進，它完整描述韻律標記、韻律參數、語言參數
之間的關係，因此可以做各種語音處理的應用，本計畫已成功用它來做多說話速度語料的分
析、中文聲調辨認、中文單詞韻律學習系統、中文TTS的韻律產生、中文語者韻律轉換。 
本計畫之成果可以做為未來更深入探討韻律結構和語意語法、語者情緒、speaking style之
關係，對擴展我們對語音的了解也許會有貢獻。

Considering this phenomenon, break type (long pause between two
prosodic phrases) and state position (position in a prosodic
phrase)-dependent state transition probabilities are also modeled
and incorporated into the LPM. They are expressed as follows:
(3)
where B, n-l E(MB, MIB, BP,MP,EP) , MB and MIB are,
respectively, the major and minor breaks between two prosody
states (#k,n1 'Pk,n) BP (beginning of a prosodic phrase), MP
(middle of a prosodic phrase) and EP (end of a prosodic phrase)
are the positions of a state in a prosodic phrase.
The types of the breaks are simply determined by the length of
the pause duration between two prosodic phrases/words. Two
thresholds are set, i.e., the pause duration of the MIBs and MBs
should be larger than 100 ms and 300 ms, respectively.
All breaks and positions could be automatically detected from
the segmentation information of an input utterance.
2.2. LPM Training Algorithms
To estimate the parameters of the LPM, a sequential
optimization procedure based on the ML criterion is adopted. It
first defines a likelihood function expressed by
(K -Nk Nk
L-lofl{ I7P(xk,ntk,n,Pk,n,2)P(Pk,l)fIP(Pk,nlPk,n-1 Bk,n-1) (4)
k-=l n=l ir-2
where K is the total number of utterances; and Nk is the total
number of syllables in utterance k.
Then, the training procedure sequentially updates the two
types of affecting factors (i.e., tone, prosody state), and re-labels
the prosody state to optimize the likelihood function L. The
sequential optimization training procedure executes the following
steps until a convergence has reached. It is worth noting that each
step updates a subset ofLPM parameters.
Step 0: Initialization
* Calculate the speaker affecting factor t by averaging
the feature vectors of all log FO contour.
* Derive the initial affecting factors otOf five tones by
averaging all residue pitch xlk,n = Xkn of each
tone.

prosody state of each syllable by vector quantization
(VQ) using the residue pitch X2k,n = xk,n - Xtk,n J -
* Derive the initial covariance matrix R
* Derive the initial prosody state transition probabilities
using the statistics of labeled prosody states.
Step 1: Update the affecting factors Xt of five tones with all other
parameters fixed.
Step 2: Re-label the prosody state sequence of all utterance using a
Viterbi search algorithm to maximize L, i,e,,
Pk =argmaxlog 171P(xk n tk I Pk,n IA)

And then update the affecting factors yp of P prosody
states, the covariance matrix R , and the prosody state
transition probabilities.
Step 3: Repeat step I to 2 until convergence
3. ONLINE LPM
A well trained LPM could be exercised online to label both
tone and prosody state sequences of an input test utterance. The
proposed online LPM is shown in Fig. 1. It has three components
including (1) a MLP tone recognizer (2) a LPM-based prosody
state labeler and (3) a LPM-assisted MLP tone recognizer. It is
worth noting that the second MLP utilizes the prosody state cues to
improve tone recognition performance.
The operation of the online LPM is as follows. First, the MLP
tone recognizer provides the initial guess of the tone sequence of
an input test utterance. Then an iterative procedure is operated, i.e.,
the LPM-based prosody state labeler and LPM-assisted MLP tone
recognizer update the labeling of tones and prosody states in turn,
until a convergence is reached. During the iteration, both the tone
recognizer and prosody state labeler output a posteriori
probabilities during the iteration.

3.1. LPM-based Prosody State Labeler
The output a posteriori probabilities of prosody state
(k n (i) = P(pk n = i xk ,2A) are derived using the following equations.
It is similar to the forward/backward algorithm used to train hidden
Markov models (HMMs):

P(Pk,, ='i Xk, A) = -kn:k:) (kn() i

4.2. Online LPM Experiments
The capacities of the well trained LPM were evaluated on
the online automatic prosody states labeling and tone recognition
tasks
4.2.1. Automatic Prosody State Labeling
Fig. 4 displays a typical example of prosody state labeling in
the testing set labeled by equation 5. The triangles represent
original logFO means of syllables normalized by the affecting
factor of speaker mean and the circles represent the pitch means
of the prosody state sequence labeled by the LPM. The dashed
lines represent prosodic phrase boundaries.
It was observed that the circle lines between prosodic
boundaries were smoother than the triangle lines. So the logFO
values of the prosody state sequence matched the nature of
prosodic phrases, since the pitch contour of a prosodic phrase is a
slow variant logFO component. From the example, the prosody
state jumps are also observed while there are prosodic boundaries
(major/minor breaks).

4.2.2. Automatic Tone Recognition
The number of nodes in the hidden layer of both the MLP
and LPM-assisted MLP tone recognizers were empirically set to
be 50. The confusion matrixes of the two tone recognizers were
shown in Table 3 and 4.
The results show that the recognition rates of tone 1, 2, 3, 5
all have been improved, although the recognition rate of tone 4
degrade a little bit. The average recognition rate was improved
from 80.86% to 82.55%. Especially for tone 3 and tone 5, the
LPM-assisted MLP brought absolute 5.80% and 6.80%
improvements comparing with the conventional MLP tone
recognizer baseline, respectively.
From those tables, it is also shown that the tone 3 and tone 4
are often confused in the conventional MLP tone recognizer. The
reason is that they may have the same logFO slope and mean at
different prosodic phrase positions. However, this problem could
be partially solved by the LPM-assisted MLP, since the a
posteriori probabilities of prosody states provide the extra
information about the underlying prosodic status. The situation is
similar for the recognition of tone 5 and 4 using the conventional
tone recognizer.

5. CONCLUSIONS
A latent prosody model of Mandarin speech was developed
in this paper. Experimental results on Tree-Bank corpus showed
that the LPM not only could automatically label the prosody state
but also improve tone recognition accuracy. Comparing with a
MLP-based tone recognition baseline, the average recognition rate
was improved from 80.86% to 82.55%. It is also found that the
prosody state information provided by LPM is especially useful
for classifying tone 3 and 5 from other types.

ABSTRACT
In this paper, the high-level prosodic patterns of prosodic word 
(PW), prosodic phrase (PPh) and breath group/prosodic phrase 
group (BG/PG) for syllable pitch-level and duration are explored 
using an automatic joint prosody labeling and modeling method. 
Experimental results on a treebank speech corpus showed that the 
explored high-level prosodic patterns not only matched well with 
our a priori knowledge about Mandarin prosody, but also 
conformed well to other previous studies. They can therefore be 
integrated to form a meaningful Mandarin prosody hierarchy.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Prosody modeling is an important research topic for text-to-speech 
(TTS). Its task is to explore the hierarchical structure of the 
prosody of a language. For Mandarin speech, the conventional 
“…small ripples riding on large waves” theory [1] suggests that 
the tones are integrated with intonation just like small ripples 
riding on large waves. Recently, [2] proposed a five-layer prosody 
model: syllable, prosodic word, prosodic phrase, breath group, and 
prosodic phrase group. Based on the model, [2] explored syllable 
duration, energy level, and pitch patterns for prosodic units of each 
layer by using a well-annotated speech database with 5 break types 
being properly labeled manually [2]. In our previous study [3], an 
automatic joint prosody labeling and modeling method was 
proposed based on a four-layer model, which is a modification of 
the five-layer model, by using an unlabeled speech database. Two 
types of prosody tags, including 6 inter-syllable beak types and 16 
prosodic states of syllable pitch level, were labeled. In this paper, 
we extend our previous study by taking these two types of prosody 
tags as primitive features to exploit the syllable pitch-level and 
duration patterns for prosodic units of the upper three layers, i.e., 
PW, PPh, and BG/PG. The construction of a quantitative prosody 
hierarchy for Mandarin speech is therefore completed. 
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the 
four-layer prosody model. Section 3 briefly reviews the findings of 
our previous study on the unsupervised joint prosody labeling and 
modeling for Mandarin speech. Section 4 presents the proposed 
formulations to explore the prosodic patterns of the upper three 
layers. Experimental results are discussed in Section 5. Some 
conclusions are given in the last section. 
2. PROSODIC PHRASE STRUCTURE 
Fig. 1 depicts a conceptual diagram of the four-layer prosody 
hierarchy of Mandarin speech [3] used in our previous and current 
studies. It is a modification of the five-layer model proposed in [2]. 
It consists of four layers: syllable (SYL), PW, PPh, and BG/PG. 
Two types of prosody tags, inter-syllable break type and prosodic 
state of syllable, are employed to characterize the prosodic units of 
these four layers. For the break type tag, we modify the 6-type 
break labeling scheme proposed by Tseng [2] by dividing B2 into 
two types, B2-1 and B2-2, and combining B4 and B5 into one 
denoted simply by B4. Here, B2-2 represents syllabic boundary of 
B2 perceived by pause, while B2-1 is B2 with F0 movement. The 
reason for dividing B2 into B2-1 and B2-2 is due to the difference 
in their acoustic characteristics, while the combination of B4 and 
B5 is owing to the similarity of their acoustic characteristics. A set 
of 6 break types,  ȁ {B0, B1, B2-1, B2-2, B3, B4}, is therefore 
adopted and used to delimit these four prosody layers. For the 
prosodic state tag, we regard the relative log-F0 level of a syllable 
in the log-F0 contour of an utterance as prosodic state for F0 
modeling. Similarly, relative syllable duration is taken as prosodic 
state in the syllable duration model. A sequence of prosodic states 
can be regarded as an aggregation of log-F0/duration variation 
patterns of the four prosody layers. This study tries to separate the 
affections of these four layers and exploit the representative log-
F0/duration patterns of PW, PPh, and BG/PG.

3. REVIEW OF THE UNSUPERVISED JOINT 
PROSODY LABELING AND MODELING 
An unsupervised joint prosody labeling and modeling method was 
proposed in our previous study [3] to simultaneously label a large 
Mandarin speech database with the two types of prosody tags and 
build the relationship between the labeled prosody tags and some 
relevant linguistic features of the associated texts. Since its results 
are the foundation of the current study, we briefly review the main 
findings of the previous study as follows. 
3.1. The Syllable Pitch Contour Modeling 
The task of joint syllable pitch contour modeling and prosody tag 
labeling is formulated as a parametric optimization problem to find 
the best prosody tags ( , B P ) given with the input acoustic 
prosodic features ( , ,SP PD PE ) and linguistic features (L,T):

length of each of the three prosodic units mainly spans 
respectively from 1 to 12 syllables for PWs, from 1 to 20 syllables 
for PPhs, and from 1 to 60 syllables for BG/PGs. Statistics in 
Table 1 shows that the average lengths for these three types of 
prosodic units are respectively 3.17 syllables or 1.85 lexical words 
(LWs) for PWs, 6.98 syllables, 4.02 LWs, or 1.69 PWs for PPhs, 
16.69 syllables, 9.62 LWs, 4.07 PWs, or 1.94 PPhs for BG/PGs. 
These data approximately matched the results reported in [6-9].

4. CONSTRUCTION OF PROSODIC PATTERNS  
We now explore the F0-level patterns for the three prosodic units 
of PW, PPh, and BG/PG. First, we extract the affecting patterns of 
prosodic state from the observed syllable F0 levels , (1)k nsp  by 
eliminating the SYL-layer influence which is realized by the 
affections of the current tone, the coarticulations from the two 
nearest neighboring tones, and the global mean, i.e.,

where (1)x  denotes the first component of vector x (i.e. log-F0 
level).  
A sequence of ,k npm  delimited by B2-1/B2-2/B3/B4 at both 
sides is then regarded as a prosodic state pattern formed by 
integrating the F0-level patterns of the three prosodic units we 
considered. A model of pitch prosodic state pattern is therefore 
defined by

is the F0-level pattern of BG/PG with ,/ ( , )k nBG PG i j  denoting 
that syllable (k,n) is located at the j-th place of an i-syllable 
BG/PG.  
Similarly, we extracted the duration prosodic state patterns 
from ,k nsd  by eliminating the SYL-layer influence realized by the 
affections of current tone, base syllable type and the global mean:

,/ k nBG PG
J are duration patterns of PW, PPh and BG/PG, respectively. 
A sequential optimization procedure based on the MMSE 
criterion is adopted to train these two models. It first defines two 
error functions, respectively, for pitch and duration modeling by

Then, with proper initializations, it sequentially updates the 
patterns of PW, PPh and BG/PG to minimize pE / dE  until a 
convergence is reached.

Fig. 5 displays the learning curves of the sequential optimization 
process of exploring prosodic patterns of syllable F0-level and

process converged around 6 iterations.

patterns calculated using more than 20 instances of prosodic state 
patterns are displayed because we want to know their general F0-
level patterns. As shown in Fig. 6(a) that all /BG PGE  had declining 
patterns with dynamic range spanning approximately from -0.1 to 
0.1. Moreover, most of them had short ending resets. From Fig. 
6(b), we find that short PPhE  had rising-falling patterns, while long 
PPhE  had rising-falling-sustaining-falling patterns. Moreover, they 
had smaller dynamic range spanning approximately in [-0.07, 007]. 
Lastly, we find from Fig. 6(c) that short PWE  showed high-falling 
patterns, while long PWE  showed falling-sustaining-falling patterns. 
Their dynamic range spanned approximately from -0.1 to 0.1. All 
these three types of F0-level patterns generally agree with our 
knowledge about Mandarin prosody.

ABSTRACT 
 
In this paper, a new approach to syllable-based modeling of F0 
contour, duration and energy for isolated Mandarin words is 
proposed. The syllable F0 contour model considers three major 
affecting factors, including lexical tone, syllable position in a word 
and inter-syllable coarticulation effect; while both the duration and 
energy models additionally consider one more affecting factor of 
base syllable type. Experimental results on a large single-speaker 
database showed that the method performed very well. Based on 
the prosodic model, a learning system for Mandarin word prosody 
pronunciation is designed and implemented for nonnative speakers.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Prosody modeling is an important research topic in text-to-speech 
(TTS). A well-designed prosodic model is the key to synthesize 
natural and pleasant speech. Currently, there are three major 
approaches of prosody modeling: rule-based, neural network-based 
and statistical model-based. The rule-based approach tries to 
generalize human’s prosody pronunciation rules from the linguistic 
point of view [1]. But, the rules are often too complicated to be 
exploited. The neural network-based approach imitates the learning 
and memorizing function of human brain. It progressively updates 
its network to learn the linguistics-prosody relationship [2]. It is 
criticized as a black box which is hard to analysis. The statistical 
model-based approach learns a model from a large corpus to build 
the relation between linguistic features and prosodic features [3]. 
In this paper, we adopt the statistical model-based approach to 
learn the prosody generation mechanism of isolated Mandarin 
words.  
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the proposed 
prosody modeling method is presented. In Section 3, experimental 
results are discussed. Some conclusions are given in Section 4. 
 
2. THE PROPOSED PROSODY MODELING METHOD 
In this study, we consider the modeling of three types of prosodic 
features including syllable log-F0 contour sp, syllable duration sd  
and syllable energy level (maximum energy of final) se. These 
three prosodic features are assumed to be independent of each 
other and their variation is controlled by four main affecting 
factors: lexical tone t , base syllable type s , syllable position in a 
word w  and coarticulation state c . The model can be generally 
expressed by

where ( | , , , )P sp t s w c , ( | , , , )P sd t s w c  and ( | , , , )P se t s w c  are 
syllable log-F0 contour, duration and energy models, respectively.  
 
2.1. Syllable F0 contour model 
We assume that the F0 contour of the n-th syllable (current syllable) 
in an isolated spoken word is mainly controlled by three affecting 
factors including the current lexical tone nt , the current syllable 
position in a word nw , and the coarticulations from the two nearest 
neighboring tones, 1nt −  and 1nt + , conditioned respectively on the 
coarticulation states, -1nc  and nc , of the syllable junctures on both 
sides. Here, coarticulation state nc  represents the degree of 
coupling between the n-th and (n+1)-th syllables in a word and is 
treated as hidden to be labeled. Specifically, the syllable F0 
contour is represented by

Generally, it can be found from the figure that the APs of c3 were 
close to flat lines to show its characteristic of “weak” coupling, 
while most APs of c1 were bent more seriously in the beginning or 
ending parts to compensate the mismatch of connecting two F0 
patterns across “tightly” coupled juncture. We also find that 
forward coarticulation APs were generally more seriously bended 
than backward coarticulation ones. This conforms with the findings 
of [6]. Moreover, we find that the well-known 3-3 tone sandhi rule 
was properly learned by the proposed model. As shown in Fig. 3(b), 
the backward coarticulation APs of (3,3) were upward bended 
drastically. This can make the reconstructed F0 pattern of the first 
tone-3 in (3,3) resemble the standard tone-2 pattern. As for the 
coarticulation APs of duration and energy, they were all small and 
less influential.

be clearly observed from Fig. 4(a)~(d) that the syllable pitch level

pitch level increased as the word length increased. Moreover, we 
find that the patterns of APs for the first two syllables in 3- to 5-
syllable words had similar shape with that of bi-syllabic word.

to decline straightly to show the declination effect.

We then analyzed the base syllable APs, sγ and sα , of 
duration and energy by CART. Some interesting phenomena were 
found: syllables with initial in {b,d,g} are shorter; syllables with 
nasal ending are longer; syllables pronounced by opening mouth 
have larger energy; syllables with single vowel have smaller 
energy; etc. These results match with the prior linguistic 
knowledge. 
Table 2 displays the total residual error (TRE) defined as the 
ratio of sum-squared values of residual and observed features. It is 
found that TRE reduced as more APs were considered. Besides, it 
is found that lexical tone, position-in-word and base syllable had 
the most significant APs for the three models of syllable log-F0 
contour, duration and energy, respectively.

Received 11 September 2007; revised 3 December 2008; accepted 3 December 2008
An unsupervised joint prosody labeling and modeling method for Mandarin speech is proposed, a
new scheme intended to construct statistical prosodic models and to label prosodic tags consistently
for Mandarin speech. Two types of prosodic tags are determined by four prosodic models designed
to illustrate the hierarchy of Mandarin prosody: the break of a syllable juncture to demarcate
prosodic constituents and the prosodic state to represent any prosodic domain’s pitch-level variation
resulting from its upper-layered prosodic constituents’ influences. The performance of the proposed
method was evaluated using an unlabeled read-speech corpus articulated by an experienced female
announcer. Experimental results showed that the estimated parameters of the four prosodic models
were able to explore and describe the structures and patterns of Mandarin prosody. Besides, certain
corresponding relationships between the break indices labeled and the associated words were found,
and manifested the connections between prosodic and linguistic parameters, a finding further
verifying the capability of the method presented. Finally, a quantitative comparison in labeling
results between the proposed method and human labelers indicated that the former was more
consistent and discriminative than the latter in prosodic feature distributions, a merit of the method
developed here on the applications of prosody modeling.

I. INTRODUCTION
The term prosody refers to certain inherent supraseg-
mental properties that carry melodic, timing, and pragmatic
information of continuous speech, encompassing accentua-
tion, intonation, rhythm, speaking rate, prominences, pauses,
and attitudes or emotions intended to express. Prosodic fea-
tures are physically encoded in the variations in pitch con-
tour, energy level, duration, and silence of spoken utterances.
Prosodic studies have indicated that these prosodic features
are not produced arbitrarily, but rather realized after a hier-
archically organized structure which demarcates speech
flows into domains of varying lengths by boundary or break
cues such as pre- and postboundary lengthening, pitch and
energy change, pauses, etc. Therefore, prosodic structure in
English, for example, functions to set up syntagmatic con-
trasts to mark a prosodic word PW, an intermediate phrase,
or an intonational boundary.1–3 On the other hand, the pro-
sodic structure of Mandarin Chinese also parses continuous
speech into different prosodic constituents by breaks that re-
flect different levels of Chinese linguistic processing: pho-
netic, lexical, syntactic, and pragmatic. As a result, succes-
sive words with related prosodic feature variations are
aggregated to form prosodic phrases PPhs, and contiguous
PPhs are, in turn, integrated to form PPhs of a higher level.
Consequently, deep exploration and an appropriate descrip-
tion of speech prosody are essential to the study of the
speech processing of any language given. To provide a pos-
sible specification of prosodic features of utterances, a three-
layer structure comprising PWs, intermediate phrases or
PPhs and intonational phrases are commonly used, espe-
cially at the sentential level.4–6 Some recent studies7 pro-
posed to integrate PPhs into PPh groups to interpret the con-
tributions of higher-level discourse information to the wider-
range and larger variations in the prosodic features of
utterances of long texts. In the science of speech processing,
to model prosody is to exploit a framework or a computa-
tional model to represent a hierarchy of PPhs of speech and
to describe its relationship with the syntactic structure of the
associated text.
In the past many prosody modeling methods have been
proposed for various applications, including generation of
prosodic information for text to speech TTS,8–10 segmenta-

human-labeled training corpus. Second, all information
sources, including acoustic and linguistic features, are sys-
tematically used via introducing the four prosodic models
in the prosody labeling. We therefore expect that the result of
the prosodic labeling is more consistent than that done by
human, which will in turn make the four prosodic models
more accurate. Third, the four prosodic models constructed
address all the four main issues of prosody modeling dis-
cussed above. So they are useful models and may be directly
used or extended to be used in those applications mentioned
above.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section II briefly describes the prosodic structure of Manda-
rin speech. Section III presents the proposed method. In Sec.
IV experimental results are discussed, and in Sec. V some
conclusions are drawn.
II. THE HIERARCHY OF MANDARIN SPEECH
PROSODY
Much literature on Chinese prosody has shown that the
prosody of Mandarin speech can be organized into hierarchi-
cal structures. A commonly agreed and used structure con-
sists of four layers, including, from the lowest layer to the
highest one, syllable layer, PW layer, PPh layer or interme-
diate phrase, and intonation phrase.38,41,42,44,45,48 As far as
the major prosodic information relevant to each of the layers
is concerned, given that Mandarin is a monosyllabic and
tonal language, where each syllable with its inherent tone
contains a lexical meaning, and each tone carries a lexically
contrastive role, the features of every syllabic tone of an
utterance are the most important prosodic information for the
lowest layer; besides, tone along with syllable constituents
affects syllable duration and energy level as well. As for the
second prosodic layer, a PW refers to disyllabic and multi-
syllabic words or phrases composed of words syntactically
and semantically closely related or most frequently collo-
cated, so the words or phrases are uttered as a single unit as
in hen “very” +bu ‘not’ +zhuan-ye “professional” not very
professional. As for the third prosodic layer, PPh is com-
posed of one or several PWs and it usually ends with a per-
ceptible but unobvious break. Finally, intonation phrase is at
the top layer of the Mandarin prosodic structure. It deter-
mines the pitch contour of the intonation of a sentence con-
taining one or several PPhs and it ends with an obvious
break. Basically, the four-layer prosodic structure interprets
the pitch and duration variations in syllable well for senten-
tial utterances.
Recently, Tseng et al.7 proposed to integrate contiguous
PPhs into PPh groups to interpret the contributions of higher-
level discourse information to the wider-range and larger
variations in syllable pitch and duration of long utterances in
paragraphs. Figure 1 displays the hierarchical prosodic
phrase grouping HPG model of Mandarin speech proposed
by Tseng et al. It is a five-layer structure. The first three
layers in the hierarchy proposed by Tseng et al. are the same
as those of the four-layer prosodic structure discussed above,
which are referred to as syllable SYL, PW, and PPh in the
system of Tseng et al., respectively. The fourth layer, breath
group BG, is formed by combining a sequence of PPhs,
and a sequence of BGs, in turn, constitutes the fifth layer,
prosodic phrase group PG. The above five prosodic units
are delimited by different types of the six breaks proposed by
Tseng et al. First, B0 and B1 are defined for SYL boundaries
within PW. Here, B0 represents reduced syllabic boundary
and B1 represents normal syllabic boundary. Usually no
identifiable pauses exist for both B0 and B1. Second, B4 and
B5 are defined for BG and PG boundaries, respectively. B4 is
a breathing pause and B5 is a complete speech paragraph end
characterized by final lengthening coupled with weakening
of speech sounds. Third, B2 and B3 are perceivable bound-
aries defined for PW and PPh boundaries, respectively.
In this study, we adopt the prosodic structure of Tseng
et al. because our speech database also consists of long Man-
darin utterances of paragraphs. However, we modify the
break-type labeling scheme of HPG model by dividing B2
into two types, B2-1 and B2-2., and combining B4 and B5
into one denoted simply by B4. Here, B2-2 represents syl-
labic boundary of B2 perceived by pause, while B2-1 is B2
with F0 movement. The reason of dividing B2 into B2-1 and
B2-2 is due to the difference of their acoustic cues to be
modeled. On the contrary, the combination of B4 and B5
owes to the similarity of their acoustic characteristics. So, the
break-type tags used is in = B0,B1,B2-1 ,B2-2 ,B3,B4.
These six break-type tags can be used to delimit four types of
prosodic units: SYL, PW, PPh, and BG/PG. These four units
are the constituents of our hierarchical prosodic structure.
To further specify the four-layer prosodic structure, a
representation of its constituents using prosodic features is
needed. Two main approaches of representation can be con-
sidered. One is direct representation approach to represent
each individual prosodic constituent by multiple prototypical
patterns for each prosodic feature of syllable pitch contour,
duration, or energy level.7–9,34–36 The other is indirect repre-
sentation approach55,56 by using some tags which carry the
information of prosodic constituents and are treated as hid-
den. Due to the following two reasons, we do not adopt
direct representation approach in the prosody modeling and
labeling study. First, the technique of direct representation
approach is still not mature enough to produce a good direct
representation for the hierarchy of Mandarin speech prosody.
The modeling errors, defined as the ratio of root mean square
errors of direct representations to the standard deviations of
the raw data, are still as high as about 30% for the multilayer
representations of syllable duration, and energy using the

fore assume that the observed syllable-based acoustic fea-
ture, sp, and the juncture-based acoustic features, pd ,ed,
are independent as B is given. So we split
Psp ,pd ,edB ,p , l , t into two terms:
Psp,pd,edB,p,l,t  PspB,p,l,tPpd,edB,p,l,t .
3
Here Psp B ,p , l , t is a syllable pitch contour model de-
scribing the variation in syllable pitch contour controlled by
B ,p , l , t and Ppd ,ed B ,p , l , t is a break-acoustics model
describing the acoustic cues of syllable junctures for differ-
ent break types. In this study, the syllable pitch contour
model is realized using a modified version of the syllable
pitch contour model proposed previously.55 It models the
pitch contour of each syllable separately and considers four
main affecting factors, including the current prosodic state
pn, the current tone tn, and the coarticulations from the two
nearest neighboring tones, tn−1 and tn+1, conditioned, respec-
tively, on the break types, Bn−1 and Bn, of the syllable junc-
tures on both sides. Specifically, the model is expressed by

n+1

r is the normalized
or residual version of spn, and x represents the affecting
pattern AP of affecting factor x. Here AP means the effect
of a factor on increase or decrease in the observed syllable
pitch contour vector spn. tn and pn are the APs of affecting
factors tn and pn, respectively; tpn is the tone pair tn
n+1
= tn , tn+1; Bn−1,tpn−1
f and Bn,tpn
b are the APs of forward and
backward coarticulations contributed from syllable n−1 and
syllable n+1, respectively; and  is the AP of global mean.
For taking care of utterance boundaries, two special break
types, Bb and Be, are assigned to the two ending locations of
all utterances, i.e., B0=Bb and BN=Be, and two special APs
of coarticulation, Bb,t1
f
=B0,tp0
f and Be,tN
b
=BN,tpN
b
, are ac-
cordingly adopted to represent the effects of utterance onset
and offset, respectively. In this study, pn is set to have non-
zero value only in its first dimension in order to restrict the
influence of prosodic state merely on the log F0 level of the
current syllable. By assuming that spn
r is zero mean and nor-
mally distributed, i.e., Nspn
r ;0 ,R, we have
Pspnpn,Bn−1
n
,tn−1

= Nspn;tn + pn + Bn−1,tpn−1
f + Bn,tpn
b + ,R
for 1 n N . 6
It is noted that the affection from l is assumed to be implic-
itly included in the affection of p and hence is neglected. We
also note that the coarticulation effect is elegantly treated to
consider different degrees of coupling between two neigh-
boring syllables via letting it depend on the break type of the
syllable juncture.
The break-acoustics model Ppd ,ed B ,p , l , t is further
elaborated via assuming that pd ,ed is independent of p , t
which mainly carries information of prosodic constituents
rather than that of syllable juncture. So we have
Ppd,edB,p,l,t  Ppd,edB,l
 	
n=1
N−1
Ppdn,ednBn,ln , 7
where pdn and edn are the pause duration and energy-dip
level of the juncture following syllable n referred to as junc-
ture n hereafter and ln is the contextual linguistic feature
vector around juncture n. For mathematically tractable,
Ppdn , edn Bn , ln is further simplified and realized by the
product of a gamma distribution for pause duration and a
normal distribution for energy-dip level:
Ppdn,ednBn,ln
= gpdn;Bn,ln,Bn,lnNedn;Bn,ln,Bn,ln
2  . 8
In this study, gpdn ;Bn,ln ,Bn,ln and Nedn ;Bn,ln ,Bn,ln
2  are
concurrently generated by the decision tree method,58 for
each break type.
Similarly, we simplify the general prosody-syntax model
PB ,pl , t via assuming the independency of B ,p and t,
and decomposing it into two models, i.e.,
PB,pl,t  PB,pl = PpB,lPBl
 PpBPBl , 9
where Pp B is a prosodic-state model describing the dy-
namics of p given with B and PBn  ln is a break-syntax
model describing the relationship between B and the contex-
tual linguistic feature sequence l. In this study, we realize
Pp B by a Markov model:
PpB  Pp1
	
n=2
N
Ppnpn−1,Bn−1 , 10
where Pp1 is the initial prosodic-state probability for syl-
lable 1 and Ppn pn−1 ,Bn−1 is the prosodic-state transition
probability from syllable n−1 to syllable n given Bn−1. We
also simplify PB  l by separately modeling it for each syl-
lable juncture:
PBl = 	
n=1
N−1
PBnln . 11
Here PBn  ln is implemented by the decision tree method.58
B. Joint prosody labeling and modeling
A sequential optimization procedure based on the maxi-
mum likelihood ML criterion is proposed to jointly label
the prosodic tags for all utterances of the training corpus and
to estimate the parameters of the four prosodic models. It is

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
The proposed method was evaluated using an unlabeled
Mandarin speech database. The database contained read
speech of a female professional announcer. Its texts were all
short paragraphs composed of several sentences selected
from the Sinica Treebank corpus.61 The database consisted of
380 utterances which contained in total 52 192 syllables. In
this experiment, the number of prosodic states was properly
set to be 16 because the root mean squared error RMSE of
VQ saturated when the number of prosodic states was greater
than 16. The sequential optimization procedure took 69 itera-
tions to reach a convergence. Following is the presentation of
the analyses, discussion, and findings of our experiment,
which is arranged in the order that an examination and inter-
pretation of the parameters of the four prosodic models was
introduced in Secs. IV A–IV D, then, to evaluate the perfor-
mance of the models proposed, explorations in the relation-
ships between prosodic breaks and linguistic features of
texts, the length of prosodic constituents, and the general
pitch patterns of prosodic constituents obtained in our
method were described in Secs. IV E–IV G, and, finally, to
further verify the labeling outcomes generated by our mod-
els, a comparison conducted between human labeling and
our labeling was given in Secs. IV H and IV I.
A. The syllable pitch contour model
We first examined the parameters of the syllable pitch
contour model Pspn pn ,Bn−1
n
, tn−1
n+1. The covariance matrices
of the original and normalized syllable log F0 contour fea-
ture vectors are shown below:
Rsp = 
883.7 23.9 − 25.6 − 0.5
23.9 90.5 9.7 − 8.2
− 25.6 9.7 17.8 − 0.9
− 0.5 − 8.2 − 0.9 5.0
  10−4 ⇒ Rspr
= 
3.5 0.2 − 0.2 0.0
0.2 31.9 2.6 − 1.5
− 0.2 2.6 11.1 0.6
0.0 − 1.5 0.6 3.7
  10−4.
Obviously, all elements of Rspr were much smaller than
those of Rsp. This showed that the influences of the affecting
factors considered were indeed essential to the variation in
sp.
Figure 3 displays the APs of five tones. We find from the
figure that the APs of the first four tones conformed well to
the standard tone patterns found by Chao.62 As for tone 5, its
low dipping pattern resembles the pattern of tone 3 to some
degree. This also matched the finding in the previous study
about tone 5.63
Table I displays the APs log F0 levels and the distri-
bution of the 16 prosodic states. It can be seen from Table I
that these log F0 levels spanned widely to cover the whole
dynamic range of log F0 variation with lower indices of pro-
sodic state corresponding to lower log F0 levels, and the
prosodic states distributed normally with relatively few lo-
cated at the two extremes of high and low prosodic states.
Figures 4a and 4c display the APs of forward and
backward coarticulations, B,tp
f and B,tp
b
, for the three break
types of B0, B1, and B4. These three break types were cho-
sen on purpose to show extreme cases of intersyllable coar-
ticulation: B0 for tightly coupling, B1 for normal coupling,
and B4 for no coupling. Some interesting phenomena can be
observed from the figure. First, it can be seen from Fig. 4a
that most APs of forward coarticulation for B0 and B1, B0,tp
f
and B1,tp
f
, were bended in their beginning parts. These bend-
ings were to compensate the level mismatch between the
beginning and ending parts of the log F0 contours of the tone
pairs for highly coarticulated preceding and current syllables,
so as to make their log F0 contours be concatenated more
smoothly. For example, the upward bending at the beginning
parts of B,tp
f tp= 1,2 , 1,3 , 2,2 , 2,3 , 1,5 were due
to H-L mismatches, while the downward bending at the be-
ginning parts of B,tp
f tp= 3,1 , 3,4 , 5,1 , 5,4 , 4,1
4,4 corresponded to L-H mismatches. Similarly, it can be
observed from Fig. 4c that the ending parts of the APs of
backward coarticulation for B0 and B1, B0,tp
b and B1,tp
b
,
were bended. But the degrees of their upward and downward
bendings were generally smaller. This conformed to the ob-
servation reported in Ref. 64 that the carry-over effect on the
syllable F0 contour influenced by the preceding syllable is
much larger than the anticipation effect caused by the fol-
lowing syllable. Second, it can be found from Figs. 4a and
4c that most APs of forward and backward coarticulations
for B4 with the same current tone looked similar and hence
were nearly independent of their respective preceding and
succeeding tones. This showed that the intersyllable coarticu-
lation across a B4 break was relatively low as compared with
those of B0 and B1. Moreover, many APs of forward and
backward coarticulations for B4 were downward bended in
their beginning and ending parts, respectively. They exhib-
ited the onset and offset phenomena at the beginning and
ending syllables of BG/PG. Furthermore, we find from Figs.
4b and 4d that most utterance initial and final patterns,
Bb,t
f and Be,t
b
, looked very similar to those of B4,tp
f and
B4,tp
b
, respectively, to show the same onset and offset phe-
nomena at the two types of utterance boundaries. We also
find that Be,3
b and Be,5
b were two exceptional patterns which

figure that the break types of higher level were generally
associated with longer pause duration and lower energy-dip
level. B0 had very short pause duration and widespread
energy-dip level with very high mean value. B1 and B2-1
had similar distributions of short pause durations and wide-
spread high energy-dip level. B2-2 had medium long pause
duration and medium high energy-dip level. Both B3 and B4
had widespread long pause duration and low energy-dip
level. These conformed to the prior knowledge about break
types.4–7
To further examine the model, we show its decision
trees for the five break types of B4, B3, B2-2, B2-1 and B1
in Fig. 6. It is noted here that no tree split for B0 due to the
relative uniformity on the acoustic prosodic features of its
samples. Generally, the questions used to split trees of
higher-level break types B4 and B3 tended to be related to
higher-level syntactic features, such as PM Q12.4 and syn-
tactic phrase size Q13.1.3, Q13.3.2, Q13.3.11, and
Q13.3.18. On the contrary, the questions of lower-level pho-
netic features Q11.1, Q11.3, and Q11.4 tended to split trees
of lower-level break types B1 and B2-1.
From above discussions, we find that the inferred break-
acoustics model describes the relationship of the break type
of syllable juncture with the two intersyllable acoustic fea-
tures and some contextual linguistic features very well. So it
seems that the model can be used to predict major and minor
breaks from acoustic and linguistic cues for some applica-
tions, such as segmenting speech into sentences and genera-
tion of punctuations from speech.
C. The prosodic-state model
We then examined the prosodic-state model. Figure 7
displays some most significant transitions of Ppn pn−1 ,Bn−1
for six break types. For B0 and B1, the general high-to-low,
nearby-state transitions showed that the syllable log F0 level
declined slowly within PWs. We also find that some low-to-
high, nearby-state transitions occurred within PWs of low
pitch level. This demonstrated the sustaining phenomenon of
the log F0 trajectory at the ending part of some PPhs. For
B2-2, it had both high-to-low and low-to-high state transi-
tions. For B2-1, B3, and B4, their low-to-high state transi-
tions showed clearly the phenomena of syllable log F0 level
resets across PWs, PPhs, and BG/PGs. Compared with these
clear log F0 level resets, the resets of B2-2 were insignifi-
cant. Combining the results shown in Figs. 5 and 7, we find
that B2-1 and B2-2 had different acoustic characteristics:
B2-1 had significant log F0 reset with very short pause du-
ration, while B2-2 had longer pause duration with low or no
log F0 reset.
From above findings, since the prosodic states defined in
our study mainly carry the full information of pitch-level
variation in the upper three layers of prosodic structure PW,
PPh, or BG/PG, the prosodic-state model can roughly rep-
resent dynamic patterns of PW, PPh, and BG/PG and may be
applied to pitch contour generation in Mandarin TTS.
D. The break-syntax model
The break-syntax model PBn  ln was built by the deci-
sion tree method using the question set 2. Figure 8 displays
the decision tree of the break-syntax model. The tree was
divided into four subtrees, T3–T6, by the three questions of

mant’s mental grammar, her Mandarin linguistic competence
that determines when to form a semantically appropriate
word chunk, a PPh, or a larger unit, and hence where and
how long a break in an utterance should be so that the infor-
mant’s speech would sound natural, informative, and atten-
tion attracting to the audience.
As a research based on our informant’s speech data rich
in the Mandarin prosodic cues, our break-type-labeling
model also can generate appropriate break types consistent
with native speakers’ psychological reality. To verify this
point, we examined the relationship between some special
groups of words/morphemes and their concurring break
types that both our break-type-labeling model and the ordi-
nary Mandarin native speakers would consistently produce.
These special groups of words/morphemes include 1 affix
morpheme; 2 DE; 3 Ng, Di, and T; 4 VE; 5 Caa and
Cb; and 6 P.65 The results are discussed in more detail as
follows.
1. Set of affix morpheme
It is well known that prefixes and suffixes are bound
morphemes that attach to their preceding or following heads
to form units of complex words. Since the resultant form
after combining the head and the affix is a unit, it is reason-
able to predict that the breaks at the boundaries between the
head and the affix tend to fall in B0 or B1 types. These
phenomena were observed in our corpus. We found that
some Mandarin Chinese monosyllabic prefixes, such as bu-
“un-, dis-, in-,” ke- “-able,” wu- “un-, -less, without,”
etc.,62,66 tend to join the following heads to form legitimate
words as in bu-li “unfavorable,” bu-fang-bian “inconve-
nient,” ke-wu “detestable,” ke-sing “feasible,” wu-sian “lim-
itless,” and wu-shuang “unparalleled.” Similarly, by attach-
ing monosyllabic suffixes, such as -bian “side,” -zhe “-er,
-or,” -hua “-ize,” etc., to the preceding roots, we can derive
complex words as in lu-bian “roadside, curb,” he-bian “riv-
erside,” zuo-zhe “author, writer,” sing-zhe “religious prac-
ticer,” gung-yie-hua “industrialize,” and min-zhu-hua “de-
mocratize.”
Table II lists the statistics of the break types labeled for
the syllable boundaries of 121 prefixes and 195 suffixes. It
can be seen from the table that 79.6% of the postsyllable
boundaries of these 121 prefixes and 98.5% of the presyl-
lable boundaries of these 195 suffixes were labeled as B0 or
B1. These prosodic findings reflect the fact that morphologi-
cally the combination of head and affix generates a lexical
unit, and thus the break between them is determined to be the
break type of intra-PW category by our method. The results
were also consistent with some rules found in Refs. 59, 60,
and 63.
2. Word set of DE
The words in the DE set particularly refer to de, zhe, and
di, which serve multifunctions including a possessive
marker, an adjective marker, and an adverbial marker.65 They
are characterized by the fact that a DE word can combine
with a wide range of preceding syntactic constituents to form
a possessive adjective as in a noun phrase NP-de structure:
xue-sheng-de quan-li “students’ right” to derive an adjective
phrase as in a verb phrase VP-de structure: se-siang-zhe qin
“nostalgia” or to function as an adverbial phrase as in a
DM-de structure: ke-ren yi-bo-bo-di yong-jin-dien-lai “guest
were flocking to the shop.” Despite the variety of the preced-
ing constituent, a DE word, similar to a suffix, builds closer
connection with its preceding constituent to form a larger
syntactic unit; consequently, it is predictable that the break at
the DE words’ preboundary position tends to fall into B0 and
B1, which means a pause is hardly to be perceived at this
juncture. It is also reasonable to infer that due to a looser
connection between the DE words and the following con-
stituent, less B0 and B1 would occur at the postboundary
position.
The statistics in Table III indicates that the distribution
of the break types labeled by our model just conformed with
our anticipation; while 92.3% preboundary breaks of the DE
words were B0 and B1, only 65% postsyllable boundaries of
the DE words fell into the same types, which suggests that
for the DE words, the majority of the neighboring breaks are
unperceivable, and in most cases only at the postboundary

two clauses—a syntactic unit much larger than Caa’s
arguments—into a compound sentence, and therefore have
higher potential to be preceded or followed by a PM in writ-
ten texts to delimit the domain of a clause or a sentence; in
read speech the occurrence of a PM elicits the announcer to
take a longer pause to index a message transition or a piece
of new message is coming. Our statistic results show that in
the case of Cb conjunctions 80% of the preword boundaries
and 20% of the postword boundaries were labeled as B3 /B4,
which means much more PMs occurred before Cb conjunc-
tions than afterward.
6. Word set of P
P represents the class of Chinese prepositions, which
precede a required argument and together play several se-
mantic roles and indicate various relationships such as time,
location, tool, purpose, etc. Although Chinese Knowledge
and information Processing CKIP categorizes prepositions
into 65 types,65 only 13 types are active in the Sinica Tree-
bank corpus. As for the adjacent pause of a preposition, it is
reasonable to expect that due to the close connection of a
preposition and its following argument, the pause at the post-
word boundary tends to be short. For convenience of illus-
tration, only ba/jiang labeled as P07 and zai labeled as
P21, two typical and most frequently used prepositions, are
selected out as the representative examples for discussion.
The statistic results in Table VII show that on the whole
for both ba/jiang and zai about 90% of the postword bound-
aries were labeled as breaks no longer than B2-1 a break
type caused by a pitch jump instead of lengthened pause
duration, which indicates that the pauses at this juncture
were either unperceivable or tending to be very short, again
another confirmation of our model’s sound labeling job. Be-
sides, a closer look at the distribution of break-type percent-
ages reveals that as high as 49% and 69% of the postword
breaks were B2-1 for ba/jiang and zai, respectively. This
statistics reflected our informant’s idiosyncratic style of ar-
ticulating prepositional phrase; namely, besides leaving no
pauses, she often made a pitch jump between a preposition
and the following argument to cause a sensible short pause.
On the other hand, as far as the labeling at the preword
boundary is concerned, most labels were either B1 or B3 /B4;
that is, 46% and 41% of the labels were B3 /B4 and 44% and
49% of them were B1 for ba/jiang and zai, respectively,
which suggests that our informant either took quite a long
pause or just no pause at the preword position. To explain
this phenomenon, further examination on the data containing
these two prepositions revealed that the informant’s long
breaks B3 /B4 before a preposition were contributed by a
left PM, and in the remained cases she usually took no pause
at this position.
F. Analyses of prosodic constituents
Based on the break-type labeling, we can divide the syl-
lable sequence of each utterance into three types of prosodic
constituents i.e., PW, PPh, and BG/PG to form a four-layer
prosodic structure. Statistics in Table VIII shows that the
average lengths for these three types of prosodic constituents
are, respectively, 3.17 syllables or 1.85 lexical words LWs
for PWs; 6.98 syllables, 4.02 LWs, or 1.69 PWs for PPhs;
and 16.69 syllables, 9.62 LWs, 4.07 PWs, or 1.94 PPhs for
BG/PGs.
According to the histograms displayed in Fig. 10, the
length of each of these three prosodic constituents spans,
respectively, from 1 to 12 syllables for PWs, from 1 to 33
syllables for PPhs, and from 1 to 99 syllables for BG/PGs.
Besides, the histograms also reveal that quite a few PPhs and
BG/PGs, whose average lengths are supposed to be about
6.98 and 16.69 syllables, respectively, are nevertheless no
longer than three syllables in length. Further investigation
into these oddly short PPhs and BG/PGs indicates that the
main reason lies in several special structure patterns of these
constituents that require a long pause to highlight their
prominence for successful information processing. First of
all, in the case of short BG/PGs, defined as a sequence of
syllables bounded by a B4 on both sides, many of the par-
ticularly short BG/PGs, actually consisted of a monosyllabic
subject and VE verb, which, as discussed in Sec. IV E 4, due
to its sentential object was tending to be followed by a long
break up to B4; accordingly, bounded by a B4 on both sides,
the structure pattern of a subject plus a VE verb, both mono-
syllabic in length, could generate as many short BG/PGs, as
possible.
As for the cases of short PPhs, defined as a sequence of
syllables delimited by 1 a B3 at both sides or 2 a B3 and
a B4 at each side, respectively, most of the B3s or B4s
bounding the very short PPhs were actually caused by the

log F0 mean, is about 21.6% by the current representation.
Figure 11 displays the patterns of PWn, PPhn, and
BG/PGn with different lengths. It is noted that only the pat-
terns calculated using more than 20 instances of prosodic-
state patterns are displayed because we want to know their
general log F0 patterns. It can be found from Fig. 11a that
all BG/PG had declining patterns with dynamic range span-
ning approximately from −0.1 to 0.1. Moreover, most of
them had short ending resets. From Fig. 11b, we find that
short PPh had rising-falling patterns, while long PPh had
rising-falling-sustaining-falling patterns. Moreover, they had
smaller dynamic range spanning approximately in
−0.07,007. Lastly, we find from Fig. 11c that short PW
showed high-falling patterns, while long PW showed
falling-sustaining-falling patterns. Their dynamic range
spanned approximately from −0.1 to 0.1.
From above analyses, we find that the prosodic-state
tags possess rich information to represent the high-level pro-
sodic constituents of the four-layer prosodic structure defined
in this study. All these three types of log F0 patterns gener-
ally agree with the findings of previous studies on intonation
patterns of Mandarin speech.55,63,67,68 The superposition pat-
terns PPh+BG/PG, and all these three patterns PW, PPh,
and BG/PG, resembled the intonation patterns reported in
the studies Tseng and co-workers69–72 and the study of Chen
et al.,34 respectively. Furthermore, with this prosodically
meaningful finding, these quantitative prosodic constituent
patterns combining with the APs of tone and coarticulation
i.e., t and B,tp
f /B,tp
b  can be used in Mandarin TTS to
generate pitch contour if all break type can be properly pre-
dicted from the input text. However, due to the fact that the
errors of the current representation are still high, a further
study to explore a more efficient representation is worth-
while doing in the future.
H. A comparison with human labeling
To further evaluate the performance of break labeling of
the proposed method, a part of the Sinica Treebank corpus
used in this study was labeled cooperatively by two experi-
enced labelers working in the Phonetics Laboratory, Depart-
ment of Foreign Languages and Literatures of National
Chiao Tung University. The annotated dataset consisted of
42 utterances with 5326 syllables. The labeling system used
was a ToBI-like one developed by the laboratory, which rep-
resents the Mandarin speech prosody by a four-layer struc-
ture containing syllable, PW, intermediate phrase, and into-
nation phrase. These four prosodic constituents are delimited
by four break types of b1, b2, b3, and b4, respectively. Here
b1 represents an implicit nonbreak index, b2 is a perceivable
break index for PW boundary, b3 is a minor-break index, and
b4 is a major-break index.
Table X displays the correlation matrix of the break in-
dices labeled by the two methods. It can be found from Table
X that 97.8% of human-labeled b4s, i.e., major breaks, were
labeled as break indices of phrase or utterance boundaries
i.e., B3, B4, or Be in our method, and 96.5% of b1s, i.e.,
nonbreaks, were labeled as indices of SYL boundaries within
PW i.e., B0 or B1. This indicates that the two labeling
methods were consistent for the two extreme cases of non-
break and major break. It is also observed from the table that
b3s mainly 73.6% corresponded to break indices 	B2-2,
suggesting that the intermediate phrase boundaries in manual
labeling, defined and perceived by the labelers as a minor
break, were, to quite a certain extent, consistently judged as
a clearly perceived short pause B2-2 or medium pause B3
in our labeling. However, in the cases of b2, 69.7% of them,
defined as perceivable breaks, inconsistently corresponded to
nonbreaks B0 or B1 in our scheme. To account for such
inconsistency, a statistics on the internal morphological and
syntactic structures of the PWs delimited by B2 and b2
shows that 1 while as high as nearly 69.3% of PW-LW
correspondence occurred in the human labeling, 40.0% of
such correspondence was found in our method, and 2 while
41.2% of the PWs labeled by our method was cases of com-
pound words or long phrases composed of at least four syl-
lables, only 2.2% of the PWs in the similar types was judged
by the labelers. This significant discrepancy in the demarca-
tion of PWs between these two methods suggests that label-
ers, though trained to listen to the prosodic cues with visual
aids of graphic user interface to label the breaks, tended to
subjectively treat LWs as PWs or as pronunciation units
rather than objectively and exclusively relied on the actual
prosodic features in prosodic labeling. This inclination obvi-
ously resulted in shorter average lengths of prosodic con-
stituents in human labeling. Figure 12 displays the histo-
grams of length of the prosodic constituents formed by the
two labeling methods. It can be found from the figure that
the average lengths of PWs, PPhs, and BG/PGs labeled by
our method were indeed longer than human-labeled PWs,
intermediate phrases, and intonational phrases, respectively.
From the perspective of prosodic features, it can be

labeled breaks were reasonable, we examined the pause du-
rations of these four word junctures and the normalized pitch
patterns of the three integrated PWs. The pause durations
were 12, 40, 22, and 1 ms. Obviously, they were all not
significant. Besides, as seen in Fig. 14b all the three nor-
malized pitch patterns of nine-syllable-NP PW and two four-
syllable compound-word PWs were smooth. So the deletions
of these four breaks by our method seemed reasonable.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, a new approach of joint prosody labeling
and modeling for Mandarin speech has been proposed. It first
employed four prosodic models to describe the relationship
of two types of prosodic tags to be labeled with the input
acoustic prosodic features and linguistic features, and then
used a sequential optimization procedure to determine all
prosodic tags and estimate the parameters of the four pro-
sodic models jointly using the Sinica Treebank speech cor-
pus. Experimental results showed that the estimated param-
eters of the four prosodic models were able to penetratingly
explore and appropriately describe the hierarchy of Mandarin
prosody. First, the syllable pitch contour model was able to
interpret the variation in syllable pitch contour controlled by
such affecting factors as lexical tones, adjacent breaks, and
prosodic state. Next, the prosodic-state model was developed
to clearly describe the declination effect of log F0 level
within PW and the resets across PW, PPh, and BG/PG, and
hence to extract the pitch patterns of each prosodic constitu-
ent. Then, the break-acoustics model could demonstrate the
distinct acoustic characteristics for each of the six break
types. The last model, the break-syntax model, was built to
express the general relationship between the break type and
the linguistic features of various levels. Besides, the perfor-
mance of our models was further confirmed by the corre-
sponding relationships found between the break indices la-
beled and their associated words which served as evidences
to manifest the connections between prosodic and linguistic
parameters, and it was also verified by our more consistent
and discriminative prosodic feature distributions than those
in human labeling by a quantitative comparison. In conclu-
sion, the method we proposed to develop the joint prosody
labeling and modeling for Mandarin speech was able to con-
struct interpretive prosodic models and generate prosodic

Abstract 
A new model-based automatic prosody labeling method for 
Mandarin speech is proposed. It first introduces four models 
to describe the relationships of the prosody tags to be labeled, 
the prosodic features of the speech signals, and the linguistic 
features of the associated texts. It then employs a sequential 
optimization procedure to estimate parameters of these four 
models and find all prosody tags. Experimental results on the 
Sinica Tree-Bank corpus showed that most prosody tags 
labeled were meaningful and the estimated parameters of 
these four models matched well with our a priori knowledge 
about Mandarin prosody. 
Index Terms: Prosody labeling, Mandarin prosody 
1. Introduction 
Automatic prosody labeling is to detect important prosody 
cues (e.g. breaks) from input speech signal and the associated 
text. A conventional pattern recognition approach [1,2] is to 
first use a well-annotated speech corpus to learn the 
relationship between prosody tags to be labeled and some 
prosodic features extracted from the speech signal in the 
training phase; and to then classify prosody tags from the 
prosodic features of the testing speech. Besides, linguistic 
features, such as word boundary, POS and syntactic phrase 
boundary, are used to set constraints to assist in the prosody 
tag classification. The main drawback of the approach is the 
lack of consistency in human’s labeling because a lot of 
acoustic and linguistic factors should be considered. 
Moreover, it is a labor-intensive task when the corpus is large. 
To circumvent these drawbacks, a new model-based 
automatic prosody labeling method for Mandarin speech is 
proposed in this paper. It first introduces four models to 
describe the relationships of the prosody tags to be labeled, 
the prosodic features of the speech signals, and the linguistic 
features of the associated texts. It then employs a sequential 
optimization procedure to estimate parameters of these four 
models and find all prosody tags. Two advantages of the 
method can be found: (1) No human-labeled training data is 
needed, and (2) Prosody labeling and modeling are 
accomplished simultaneously. 
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly 
describes the prosody structure of Mandarin speech. Section 3 
presents the proposed method. Experimental results are 
discussed in Section 4. Some conclusions are drawn in the 
last section. 
2. Prosody Structure of Mandarin Speech 
Fig.1 displays a conceptual prosody hierarchy of Mandarin 
speech. In the structure, syllables (SYL) located in the lowest 
layer are the basic prosody units to form prosodic words 
(PWs) of the second layer. PWs are then concatenated to form 
minor prosodic phrases (MIPPHs) of the third layer. MIPPHs 
are combined to form major prosodic phrases (MPPHs) in the 
top layer.  
 
Fig. 1: A conceptual prosody hierarchy of Mandarin speech. 
Following the guideline of ToBI labeling system [3], five 
break types, B0~B4, of inter-syllable pause are defined. Their 
relationships with the prosody hierarchy are shown in Fig.1. 
B0 represents an intra-PW syllabic boundary that the two 
neighboring syllables are tightly coupled. B1 is also an intra-
PW syllabic boundary but with normal coupling. B2 
represents an inter-PW syllabic boundary with short pause or 
minor pitch reset. B2 is further divided into two subclasses: 
B2-1 (with minor pitch reset) and B2-2 (with apparent short 
pause). B3 and B4 represent minor and major breaks with 
medium and long pauses, respectively. Besides, they usually 
accompany medium or large pitch resets.  
3. The Proposed Method 
The task of the prosody labeling is to determine the break 
types of inter-syllable pauses and the prosodic states of 
syllables given with prosodic features, including syllable 
pitch contour features, pause duration, and pause energy dip, 
as well as linguistic features of various levels. Here, prosodic 
state is a tag to conceptually represent the state of the syllable 
in a prosodic phrase. The proposed model-based approach is 
to perform the prosody labeling via assuming four models 
describing the relationship of those features. The task can be 
formulated as a parametric optimization problem:

4. Experimental Results 
The proposed method was evaluated using a Mandarin speech 
database. The database contained the read speech of a single 
female professional announcer. Its texts were all short 
paragraphs composed of several sentences selected from the 
Sinica Tree-Bank Corpus [4]. The database consisted of 380 
utterances with 52192 syllables. All syllable segmentation 
and F0 detection were first done automatically using HTK 
and ESPS, respectively, and then error corrected manually. In 
the prosody labeling, we set the number of prosodic states to 
be 16. The optimization process converged after 30 iterations. 
In the following, we analyze the experimental results.

This showed that the influences of many affecting factors 
have been removed. Fig.4 displays the patterns of five tones 
(left) and prosodic states (right). The learned tone patterns 
matched very well with our knowledge of standard tone 
patterns.

It can be observed that many forward (backward) patterns 
were bent in their beginning (ending) parts. This mainly 
resulted from the pitch level mismatch between the beginning 
and ending of the preceding-current (current-following) F0 
contours; e.g. , | (1,2),(1,3),(1,5),(2,2),(2,3)}{ Bf tp tp =β  were 
due to H-L mismatches, while , | (3,1),(3,4),(5,1)}{ Bf tp tp =β  
corresponded to L-H mismatches. We also observed that the 
curvatures of patterns for B0 were larger than those for B1 
and B4. This confirms that the lower level of break type 
corresponds to the case of more tightly coupling between the 
two consecutive syllable F0 contours. The most interesting 
patterns are ,(3,3)B
bβ  for B0 and B1 which go upward 
drastically to conform to the well-known 3-3 tone sandhi rule. 
Lastly, most forward (backward) patterns for B4 were upward 
(downward). This exhibits the reset (offset) phenomenon in 
the beginning (end) syllable of a MPPH.

Fig. 7 shows the decision trees of pause acoustic model

higher-level break type is affected by higher-level linguistic 
features. For B4 and B3, PM and sentence/phrase size are 
affecting factors. For B1 and B0, initial types of fricative and 
stop are affecting factors.

Speech and Its Application to Prosody Generation for TTS

Abstract 
Motivated by the success of the unsupervised joint prosody 
labeling and modeling (UJPLM) method  for Mandarin speech 
on modeling of syllable pitch contour in our previous study, in 
this paper, the advanced UJPLM (A-UJPLM) method is 
proposed based on UJPLM to jointly label prosodic tags and 
model syllable pitch contour, duration and energy level. 
Experimental results on the Sinica Treebank corpus showed 
that most prosodic tags labeled were linguistically meaningful 
and the model parameters estimated were interpretable and 
generally agreed with other previous study. In virtue of the 
functions given by the model parameters, an application of A-
UJPLM to the prosody generation for Mandarin TTS is 
proposed. Experimental results showed that the proposed 
method performed well. Most predicted prosodic features 
matched well to their original counterparts. This also 
reconfirmed the effectiveness of the A-UJPLM method. 
Index Terms: prosody modeling, prosody labeling, prosody 
generation, text-to-speech system  
1. Introduction 
Prosody generation plays a very important role on the 
naturalness of the synthesized speech in a TTS system. The 
main concern is to explore an appropriate mapping from the 
linguistic features extracted from the input text to the prosodic 
features of the synthesized speech. Concluding from the 
previous studies, prosody generation methods can be roughly 
divided into two classes, including (1) direct modeling 
approach and (2) hierarchical prosody approach. In direct 
modeling approach, for Mandarin speech, explicit numerical 
prosodic targets such as syllable or initial/final duration, 
syllable pitch contour, syllable energy level and inter-syllable 
pause duration are directly predicted from input linguistic 
features by some pattern recognition tools like artificial neural 
networks [1] and recurrent neural network [2], etc. The main 
advantage of this approach is that it can be automatically 
established without much help of linguistic expertise. 
However, it is very difficult to analyze and modify its hidden 
structure when some unsatisfactory prosody is generated. This 
approach usually focuses on modeling of prosodic feature 
variation in each syllable, initial or final rather than 
considering prosody hierarchy. On the other hand, in 
hierarchical prosody approach [3], symbolic prosodic features 
such as break types are first predicted from the input linguistic 
features. A prosody hierarchical structure, for example, from 
top layer to lower layer: intonation phrase, prosodic phrase, 
prosodic word, and syllable, is hence obtained from the 
predicted symbolic prosodic features. Then, numerical 
prosodic features are obtained by superimposing prosodic 
patterns of various layers pre-stored or generated from a 
model, or by selecting prosodic templates from a speech 
inventory. Through this approach, suprasegmental prosodic 
pattern and variation of each level can be easily analyzed and 
manipulated. However, it encountered some drawbacks of 
inconsistencies of break labeling caused by human's individual 
subjectivity and fatigue during long time labeling so as to 
propagate error to prosody modeling. It is also a time 
consuming task that requires rich linguistic expertise. 
    To circumvent the above-mentioned disadvantages, an 
unsupervised joint prosody labeling and modeling method 
(UJPLM) for Mandarin was proposed in the previous study [4], 
a new scheme intended to construct interpretable statistical 
prosodic models and to consistently label prosodic tags for an 
unlabeled Mandarin speech corpus. The task automatically 
determines prosodic tags that describe a prosody hierarchy and 
to build four prosodic models simultaneously. In this paper, 
motivated by the success of the UJPLM on the modeling of 
syllable pitch contour, we extend the study to include the other 
two important prosodic features, syllable duration and energy 
level. The study will jointly model syllable pitch contour, 
duration and energy level using the same method presented in 
the previous study. For simplicity, this extension is referred to 
as the advanced UJPLM (A-UJPLM) method. Then, an 
application of A-UJPLM to the prosody generation for 
Mandarin TTS is proposed. A more substantial prosody 
labeling and modeling for Mandarin speech was achieved by 
the A-UJPLM method. This paper is organized as follows. A 
brief review of UJPLM is given in Section 2. Section 3 
introduces the proposed A-UJPLM in this work. Section 4 
presents the proposed model-based approach to prosody 
generation. Some conclusions are drawn in the last section. 
2. Review of UJPLM 
2.1. Prosody Hierarchy and Prosodic Tags 
Fig. 1 displays the prosody hierarchy adopted in the previous 
and current studies. It consists of four layers: syllable (SYL), 
prosodic word (PW), prosodic phrase (PPh), and 
breath/prosodic phrase group (BG/PG). Two types of prosody 
tags, break type and prosodic state of syllable, are employed 
to characterize the prosodic constituents of these four layers. 
A set of six break types,  {B0, B1, B2-1, B2-2, B3, B4}, is 
used to delimit these four prosody layers. Notice that B2-1 and 
B2-2 are divided from B2 and defined as a PW boundary with 
irregular F0 reset and perceived short pause, respectively.  
Fig. 1: A conceptual prosody hierarchy of Mandarin speech.
    The prosodic state tag is conceptually defined as the state in 
a prosodic phrase and used as a substitution for the effects 
from high-level linguistic features, such as a word, a phrase or 
a syntactic tree. It is also assumed to account for the prosodic 
variation contributed by higher-level prosodic constituents (i.e. 
PW, PPh and BG/PG) that carry suprasegmental prosodic

the use of different combinations of APs. It can be seen from 
the table that the TREs reduced as more APs were considered 
and the most significant one is prosodic state. The variations 
of syllable prosodic features of spn, sdn, and sen were
effectively removed by the considered APs. 
Table 1: TREs (%) of the modelings for spn, sdn, and sen w.r.t. the 
use of different combinations of APs.
Pitch Duration Energy level 
APs TRE APs TRE APs TRE
  + Utterance 99 + Utterance 78
+ Tone 72 + Tone 88 + Tone 75
+ Coarticulation 60 + Base-syllable 63 + Final 48
+ Prosodic state 1 + Prosodic state 1 + Prosodic state 1
The means of pause duration for seven break types of B0,
B1, B2-1, B2-2, B2-3, B3 and B4 were 3, 11, 18, 109, 16, 287 
and 543 ms, respectively. This result conformed that the break 
types of higher level were generally associated with longer 
pause duration. The structure of the constructed decision tree 
for the break-syntax models generally agreed with the one 
constructed by UJPLM in the previous study [4]. The APs of 
pitch, duration and energy prosodic states spanned widely to 
cover the whole dynamic ranges of syllable log-F0 level, 
duration and energy level variations with lower indices of 
prosodic state representing lower log-F0 levels, shorter 
syllable durations, and lower energy level respectively. In the 
constructed prosodic state models, low to high pitch and 
energy prosodic state index jumps were clearly observed on 
the juncture of B3 and B4 illustrating pitch and energy resets 
in the beginning of a PPh or BG/PG while high to low 
duration prosodic state index jumps on the juncture of B3 and 
B4 illustrating apparent pre-boundary lengthening effect in the 
end of a PPh or BG/PG. 
A typical example of the labeling results by A-UJPLM is 
given in Fig. 2. Most breaks labeled were the same except for 
an inserted B2-3 after the 5th syllable and a substitution of B3
with B4 after the 11th syllable. The insertion of B2-3 seemed 
to be reasonable because there existed an apparent syllable 
duration lengthening on the 5th syllable. For each prosodic 
feature of syllable log-F0 mean, duration and energy level, the 
curve formed by integrating the prosodic-state APs and global 
mean showed smoother PW patterns as compared with those 
of the observed zigzag curve. The last syllables of all PWs had 
longer syllable duration illustrating the pre-boundary duration 
lengthening effect. It is also found that apparent resets existed 
on the energy prosodic state of the last syllables of most PWs 
manifesting clear stress patterns. These phenomena matched 
well with the findings of Tseng [5]. 
Fig. 2: An example of the automatic prosody labeling by A-
UJPLM: observed syllable prosodic feature (open circle) and 
prosodic state+global mean (solid diamond).
The proposed A-UJPLM was able to construct 
interpretive prosodic models and to generate proper prosodic 
tags automatically. Therefore, it can be directly used or 
extended to be used in the application of prosody generation 
for TTS system as presented in Section 4. 
4. A-UJPLM-based Prosody Generation  
In this section, an A-UJPLM-based approach is proposed for 
prosody generation. It is composed of two steps: break 
prediction and prosodic feature prediction. In the break 
prediction step, a break type sequence is predicted for each 
input text by the break-syntax model ( | )n nP B l  using some 
linguistic features extracted from the input text and plays an 
important role to properly parse the input text into strings of 
PWs, PPhs, and BG/PG. In the prosodic feature prediction 
step, four types of prosodic features, including syllable pitch 
contour, syllable duration, syllable energy level, and inter-
syllable pause duration, are generated from input linguistic 
features and the break-type sequence generated in the first step 
by using the syllable pitch/duration/energy prosodic models, 
the prosodic state models, and the break-acoustic model. 
To evaluate the performance of the proposed break 
prediction and prosodic feature prediction methods, the test set 
of the Sinica Treebank corpus is adopted. It is labeled in 
advance by the prosodic models trained in Section 3 with 
seven types of break and three types of prosodic states by 
decoding of Eq. (3).  
4.1. Break Prediction 
Based on the decision tree of break-syntax model trained in 
section 3, we let the decision tree grow using more 
sophisticated linguistic features to predict break only from 
linguistic feature. A window up to six words is adopted in this 
study to extract the POS and word length features for the 
break prediction of the current word juncture: three words 
before and after the juncture. Table 2 displays the prediction 
accuracy. It can be found from the table that the prediction 
rates were high for B1 and B4, medium for B3 and B0, and 
low for B2-1, B2-2 and B2-3. By analysis of the confusion 
between predicted and correct breaks, it is found that minor 
breaks (B2-1/2-2/2-3) were easily confused with non-break 
and major break were easily predicted as B2-2. For improving 
the prediction rate, especially minor break, utilizing more 
sophisticated linguistic features, such as syntactic phrase or 
syntactic tree is worthwhile doing in the future. 
Table 2: Prediction accuracy (%) of (a) three broad classes of 
break, and (b) the seven break types. 
Non-break Minor break Major break Avg(a)

4.2. Prosodic Feature Prediction 
The prosodic features to be predicted include syllable prosodic 
features (spn, sdn, sen) and inter-syllable pause duration (pdn).
Among them, the inter-syllable pause duration of each syllable 
juncture can be simply predicted by the break-acoustic model 
trained in section 3, i.e. 
* *=arg max ( | , )
n

where *nB  represents the optimal break type of juncture n
predicted by the break-syntax model predicted in Section 4.1.

Abstract 
In this paper, a novel model-based pitch conversion method 
for Mandarin is presented and compared with other two 
conventional conversion methods, i.e. the mean/variance 
transformation approach and the GMM-based mapping 
approach. Syllable pitch contour is first quantized by 3rd order 
orthogonal expansion coefficients; then, the source and target 
speakers’ prosodic models are constructed, respectively. Two 
mapping methods based on the prosodic model are presented. 
Objective tests confirmed that one of the proposed methods 
are superior the conventional methods. Some findings in 
informal listening tests and objective tests are worthwhile to 
further investigate.

1. Introduction 
Voice conversion (VC) is a technique that transforms a certain 
voice to another specific voice. A typical VC application is 
speaker conversion [1,2]. The objective of speaker conversion 
is to transform the source speaker’s voice in order that it 
sounds as similar to a target speaker.  
In the last decade, only a few recent efforts have continued 
to address the prosody conversion in contrast with spectral 
conversion [3,4]. This study concerns only pitch conversion. 
For pitch conversion, it is more reasonable to convert 
suprasegmental based features rather than frame based features 
since the trajectory of pitch values (i.e. pitch contour) is more 
meaningful than pitch values, especially for tonal languages 
such as Mandarin Chinese. Thus, this paper attempts to 
convert syllable pitch contour rather than pitch values frame-
by-frame. 
Recently, researchers start to apply the knowledge in 
prosody studies to prosody conversion in order to more 
accurately realize speaking style conversion [4]. To adopt the 
knowledge in prosody studies to pitch conversion, an 
unsupervised joint prosody labeling and modeling method 
(PLM) [5] for Mandarin is employed in this study.  
First, in the training phase, syllable pitch contour is 
quantized using a set of 3rd order orthogonal expansion 
coefficients [6], then, the source and target speakers’ prosodic 
models are constructed by the PLM method. In the same time 
of the model constructions, the source and target speaker’s 
corpora are labeled with the break types representing 
boundaries of prosodic constituents, and the prosodic state 
carrying prosodic variation contributed from higher-level 
prosodic constituents, i.e. prosodic word, prosodic phrase, etc. 
The mapping function is then obtained from the prosodic tags 
labeled and the constructed prosodic models. In the 
conversion phase, the prosodic tags of the source speaker are 
labeled by PLM; subsequently, the mapping function is 
adopted to convert the source speaker’s feature vectors to 
those of target speaker. Lastly, the output speech is 
synthesized by the STRAIGHT algorithm [7] using prosodic 
features and spectral features. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section 2 deals with two conventional methods for converting 
syllable pitch contour. Section 3 introduces the prosodic 
model used in this work. Two model-based pitch conversion 
methods for Mandarin speech are proposed. In Section 4, 
objective and informal listening tests are presented. Some 
conclusions are drawn in the last section.

2.1. Mean/variance transformation 
Let nx and ny  be the 4 1×  source and target feature 
vectors at the n-th syllable, respectively. Both distributions of 
nx  and ny  are modeled as Gaussian distribution, i.e., 
( ) ( ; , ),  ( ) ( ; , ). n n n nP N P N= =x xx y yyx x   y y    (1)

Eq.(15) can be interpreted as that we first use the labeled

This section deals with objective and informal listening 
tests. All the methods mentioned previously were evaluated 
and compared. 
4.1. The Database 
The experimental corpus used in this study is the Sinica 
COSPRO [9]. There are nine sets in this corpus in which 
COSPRO 03, the intonation-balanced speech corpus, was 
adopted in this study. This is a parallel corpus with totally five 
speakers. Two male speakers (refer to M1, M2) and two 
female speakers (refer to F1, F2) were selected. Training set 
and test set were randomly selected from 757 utterances of 
declarative sentences (24369 syllables) with a ratio of four to 
one. Four different pitch conversion pairs were conducted: 
M1-to-M2, F1-to-M1, M2-to-F2, and F2-to-F1 conversions.

Abstract
In this paper, the prosody of a parallel multi-
speaking rate Mandarin read speech corpus is
investigated. The corpus contains four parallel speech
datasets uttered by a female professional announcer
with various speech rates (SRs) of 4.40 (fast), 3.82
(normal), 2.97 (median) and 2.45 (slow)
syllables/second. By using the unsupervised joint
prosody labeling and modeling (PLM) method
proposed previously, the relationship between SR and
various prosodic features, including pause duration,
patterns of three high-level prosodic constituents, and
the break labels, are investigated. The analyses
reported in this study could be very informative in
developing prosody generation mechanism for text-to-
speech and prosody modeling for automatic speech
recognition in various SRs.
1. Introduction
With the development of corpus-based and the
hidden Markov model-based speech synthesis
technologies, there is a great advancement in the
performance of text-to-speech systems (TTS).
However, in some applications, it is not satisfactory to
synthesize speech in only a single speaking rate. For
example, an automatic ticket ordering system usually
prompts by a TTS system in a fixed speaking rate. It is
time-consuming to listen to all information if a
customer is in a hurry or very familiar with the system.
Hence, a TTS system in a fast speaking rate is required
in this condition so as not to make the customer lose
his patience. On the contrary, for foreigners or elder
people, it is not very easy to understand the prompts
with fast or normal speed synthesized speech. From
above discussions, the development of prosody
generation mechanism for a TTS system in various
speaking rates is worthwhile doing. In the past, many
studies discussed the interaction between prosody

variation and speaking rate: Yu [1] proposed a prosody
generation method for dialog Mandarin speech in a
faster speaking rate. Li [2] found that the effect of
speaking rate on Mandarin discourse prosody is
nonlinear. In the study of Tseng [3], Mandarin
prosodic constituent patterns of syllable duration and
intensity were quantitively investigated.
In this paper, the unsupervised joint prosody
labeling and modeling (PLM) method for Mandarin
speech [4] proposed previously is adopted to explore
the Mandarin prosody of a parallel multi-speaking rate
speech corpus. By using the PLM method, the corpus
can be automatically labeled with prosodic tags of
break types that delimit prosodic constituents, and
prosodic states that represent the variations of higher-
level prosodic constituents, i.e. prosodic word (PW),
prosodic phrase (PPh), and breath/prosodic phrase
group (BG/PG). The labeled prosody tags and the
model parameters are taken as primitive features to
explore the relationship between speaking rate and
various prosodic features, including pause duration,
patterns of the three high-level prosodic constituents,
and the break labels.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2
introduces the speech corpus used in this study.
Section 3 presents the PLM analysis method. Section 4
devotes to the analysis of the variation of model
parameters in various speaking rates. The analyses of
the labeled break types and the derived high-level
prosodic constituents in various speaking rates are
discussed in Sections 5 and 6, respectively. Some
conclusions are given in the last section.
2. Experimental Database
Four parallel unlabeled read Mandarin speech
datasets uttered by a professional female announcer
were used to investigate the prosody variation in
various speaking rate, i.e. fast, normal, median and
slow. The normal speaking rate one was first recorded

take the APs of BO for example because the difference
between forward coarticulation APs in different SR for
BO were most significant among other break types.
Recall that BO is defined as a tightly coupling intra-
PW break type. It was found that the compensation for
high-low or low-high mismatch was more serious
(more distant from zero) in the beginning of a syllable
for slower SR speech. Due to the fact that the pitch
contour of coarticulation APs for the faster SR speech
were generally closer to zero , the pitch contours of the
faster SR speech would be more similar to straight
lines.
Figure 5 illustrates pause duration distributions of
each SR speech modeled by gamma distributions.

Figure 3 displays the tone APs for pitch contour in
various SRs. Comparing only between fast, median
and slow speech corpus, the dynamics ranges of tone
APs became smaller when SR was faster. This result
suggested that faster SR would make articulated pitch
contour of tones incomplete. Generally, slow speech
would have more canonical pitch contour of five
lexical tones. The tone APs for the fast speech can be
regarded as the middle part of tone APs for the slow
speech hence the dynamic range of the fast speech was
reduced. However, it was found that tone APs of the
normal SR corpus was slightly different from the
others. We suggest that this inconsistency was partly
resulted by the better segmentation of the normal
corpus. Figure 4 displays APs of forward

Figure 2. Histograms of utterance-wise ARs.
Some important prosodic properties of corpora in
different SRs can be directly interpreted by the model
parameters trained by the PLM method. Among these
parameters, we found that the duration APs of global
mean and utterance, the pitch APs of lexical tone and
coarticulation, and pause duration in the break-
acoustics model were most significant ones that
characterized the difference between various SRs. We
discuss them in the following.
Figure 2 shows histograms of utterance-wise ARs
which are equivalent to the reciprocal of the sum of
syllable duration APs of utterance and global mean, i.e,
Yu. + f.ld. Interestingly, it can be seen from the figure
that the distributions of utterance-wise ARs in various
speaking rates overlapped especially in the pair of fast-
normal corpora and the pair of median-slow corpora
although the announcer were instructed to utter in four
different speaking rates.

level (i.e. the APs of tones and coarticulation) for the
fast speech accounted for the less variation in 10gFO
comparing to the APs for the other SRs. This result
conform well to the finding in Section 4 that the APs
of tones and coarticulation for fast SR speech have
smaller dynamic ranges. As for duration modeling, an
apparent relative TRE reduction (54.7-43.7) can be
found by adding the duration patterns of PPh in the
fast speech. This reduction can serve as an evidence
that the speaker preferred using more obvious pre-
boundary lengthening in the end of a PPh as she spoke
faster. Last, in energy modeling, very little TRE
reductions provided by adding PW patterns indicated
that most energy level variation was mainly
contributed by the other high-level prosodic
constituents, i.e. PPh and SO/PO.
In this paper, we investigated the prosody of a
multi-speaking rate paralIel speech corpus uttered by a
professional female announcer. The general patterns of
the four-layer prosodic constituents (i.e. SYL, PW,
PPh and SO/PO) manifested some meaningful
interactions with the speaking rate. The variations on
some features, e.g. dynamic rage, of these prosodic
patterns may be interpreted as that the speaker
provided different cues to signal the prosodic
boundaries for different speaking rate. Besides, the
analysis on the break types labeled showed that the
speaker adopted different prosodic phrasing strategy
for different speaking rate. These results would be very
helpful in the development of a multi-speaking rate
TIS system. This is worthwhile doing in the future.

Pw,.=(i,j) , PPhn=(i,j) , and BG / PGn=(i,j) denote
that syllable n is located at the j -th place of an i-
syllable PW, PPh, and SO/PO, respectively. A
sequential optimization procedure based on the
minimum mean squared error criterion is adopted to
train the model.
Figures 8 and 9 display the obtained 10gFO patterns
of SO/PO, PPh and PW for various SRs. A trend can
be seen from the figures that the patterns of BOIPO
and PPh in the faster speech began at higher 10gFO
level and resulted in a larger dynamic range. These
results implied that the speaker tended to use higher
pitch reset to delimit SO/PO and PPh boundaries. All
long SO/PO had falling-sustaining-falling patterns
while short ones had simply falling patterns. Rising-
falling-sustaining-falling patterns and rising-falling
patterns were respectively observed for long and short
PPhs only in the fast and normal speech. In the cases
of the median and slow SR speech, the patterns began
with falling and ended with sustaining in the last two
syllables. As for the patterns of PW, alI short PWs
have falling patterns while long PWs have falling-
sustaining-falling patterns.

duration patterns of SO/PO, PPh and PW in various
SRs. AlI SO/PO duration patterns shortened in the last
syllable. In the patterns of PPh and PW, a trend can be
clearly found that faster speech manifested more
apparent pre-boundary lengthenings in the ends of PPh
but less lengthenings in the ends of PW. These results
indicated that the speaker preferred using pre-
boundary lengthenings to delimit speech flow into
prosodic constituents of the higher level as she spoke
faster.
As for the energy level patterns of SO/PO, PPh and
PW shown in Figures 12 and 13, the patterns of
SO/PO were very similar to the pitch patterns of
SO/PO that the faster speech began with larger value.
This result implied that the speaker used more power
in the beginning of SO/PO when she uttered faster. As
for the patterns of PPh and PW, more apparent energy
level resets in the end could be found in the faster SR
speech.

respect to different aggregate combinations of prosodic
constituents for pitch, duration, energy modelings in

percentage of sum-squared residue over the observed
prosodic features. It can be seen from the table that
TREs of the normal SR speech were generalIy smaller
than those of the other SRs. This result may be resulted
from the better speech segmentation and FO extraction

Abstract—In this paper, an investigation on the prosody of 
Mandarin spontaneous speech is conducted by using the 
unsupervised joint prosody labeling and modeling (PLM) method 
proposed previously for read speech. Its effectiveness was confirmed 
by the experimental results on an unlabeled dialogue corpus, MCDC. 
Many meaningful characteristics of spontaneous-speech prosody 
were explored from the parameters of the well-trained prosodic 
models. The patterns of high-level prosodic constituents of a prosody 
hierarchy were derived. An analysis of disfluencies related to the 
labeling results was also discussed. Those results would be very 
advantageous in providing rich prosodic information for ASR. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, prosodic information are widely used in 
spontaneous speech processing for the detection of 
disfluencies and sentence-like boundaries [1-2], the 
segmentation of dialog acts [3], the improvement of automatic 
speech recognition (ASR) [4], and so on. In those previous 
works, prosodic features are firstly extracted from speech 
corpus labeled with prosody tags or boundary types, and then 
prosodic models are built and used in the tasks. However, to 
prepare a large spontaneous speech corpus with prosody tags 
being properly labeled is in general a difficult task. Some 
prosody representation systems on spontaneous speech have 
been proposed in the past. The labeling systems based on 
ToBI framework [5] and its modifications, such as C-ToBI [6] 
and X-JToBI [7], are most popular. Batliner et al. [8] 
proposed a syntactic-prosodic labeling system for large 
spontaneous speech corpus. However, performance of human 
labeling can not be guaranteed even if well-experienced 
annotators are involved. 
In this paper, an unsupervised joint prosody labeling and 
modelling (PLM) method is proposed. It is a modified version 
of the previous PLM method [9] proposed for read Mandarin 
speech. It labels an unlabeled spontaneous Mandarin speech 
corpus with two types of prosody tags, break type of inter-
syllable juncture and prosodic state of syllable, and builds 
eight prosodic models simultaneously. The break tag can be 
used to delimit prosodic constituents of a hierarchical prosody 
structure, and the prosodic state can be used to construct the 
prosodic feature patterns of prosodic constituents. The eight 
prosodic models describe the relationships of acoustic 
prosodic features, prosody tags of utterances, and the 
linguistic features of the associated texts. They can be used in 
various speech processing applications. 
This paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the 
speech corpus used in this study. Section III presents the PLM 
method. Section IV discusses the experimental results of the 
model parameters, and analyzes the labeling results for normal 
speech flow and disfluencies. Some conclusions are given in 
the last section. 
II. EXPERIMENTAL DATABASE 
The database used consists of eight dialogue sessions 
selected from the Mandarin Conversational Dialogue Corpus 
(MCDC) [10] collected from 2000 to 2001 by the Institute of 
Linguistics of Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan. Its total 
length is about ten hours. The eight dialogue sessions were 
uttered by nine female and seven male speakers, and 
transcribed into Chinese texts with some other tags including 
discourse marker (DM), particles, and pauses by professional 
linguist annotators. Some important spontaneous speech 
phenomena were also annotated. They include disfluencies, 
particular pronunciation, discourse-related items, and 
sociolinguistic phenomena.  
The transcriptions were forced-aligned to the waveform by 
using a speech recognizer trained by the Hidden Markov 
Model toolkit (HTK) [11] using an 8.9-hour subset of the 
MCDC corpus. The recognizer consists of 100 right-context 
dependent initial and 39 context-independent final HMM 
models. Fundamental frequencies of all speech signals were 
first detected by the ESPS algorithm [12]. Half and double 
pitch errors were then corrected by a Gaussian mixture model-
based classifier [13] followed with a syllable-wise pitch 
contour smoothing method. For each syllable, the pitch 
contour was represented by four coefficients of orthogonal 
transform using the Legendre polynomials up to the 3rd order 
[14]. To accomplish a speaker-independent prosody labeling 
and modeling, all F0 values and syllable durations/energy 
levels were normalized respectively by the frame-wise and 
syllable-wise Gaussian mean-and-variance normalizations 
[15]. 
III. THE PROPOSED METHOD 
A. Prosody Hierarchy, Tags and Features 
Fig. 1 displays the prosody hierarchy adopted in the current 
study. It is a modified version of the structure utilized in read 
speech prosody [9]. For normal speech, it consists of four 
layers: syllable (SYL), prosodic word (PW), prosodic phrase 
-1( | , , ) ( | , ) ( ; , )n n
n
n n n n n n n pr r e eP se r B P se r pr N se Rα α μ′ ′≈ = + +L       (8) 
Notice that the three particular syllable-like prosodic models 
use the same global means of normal-speech prosodic models, 
and use their own covariances of residual, syllable-level APs 
and prosodic state APs. 
A special training procedure is designed. It first employs a 
sequential optimization to label prosodic tags and determine 
model parameters for the normal speech part of the unlabeled 
corpus. Then, the global means of normal-speech prosodic 
models are used to assist in labeling prosodic tags and 
determine model parameters for the particular syllable-like 
part. The reasons of adopting the special training procedure 
are stated as follows. First, it can prevent the training from 
being dominated by the particular syllable-like type which has 
wilder prosody variability. Second, using the same global 
means of normal-speech prosodic models in the training of 
particular syllable-like part makes their APs have the same 
bases to compare. 
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
The experiment was conducted on the MCDC corpus which 
consisted of 3,501 dialogue turns with in total 121,242 
syllables. The number of pitch/duration/energy prosodic states 
was empirically set to be 20 including 16 states for normal 
speech part and four states for PPC. The sequential 
optimization procedure took 59 iterations to reach a 
convergence. Following is examinations and interpretations of 
the parameters of the prosodic models and analysis of speech 
flow. 
A. Analyses on Model Parameters  
1)  Syllable Prosodic Model 
Tables I and II display the total residual errors (TREs) of 
base syllable and particular syllable, which are the percentage 
of sum-squared residue of log-F0/syllable duration/syllable 
energy level over the observed sum-squared counterparts with 
respect to the use of different combinations of affecting 
factors. It can be found from the table that the TRE is reduced 
as more affecting factors were used. The lower-level affecting 
factors/linguistic features (i.e., tone with coarticulation, base-
syllable, final type, and particular syllable-like types) 
accounted for 9.4%, 16.3%, and 13.2% of prosodic variation 
in pitch, duration, and energy level for the normal-speech part, 
and 11.9%, 3.4%, and 8.6% for the particular syllable-like part. 
The high-level prosodic constituents contributed another 
76.5%, 82.0%, and 84.3 % of prosodic variation in pitch, 
duration, and energy for normal speech, and 39.8%, 82%, and 
47.2% for particular syllable-like part. Obviously, the 
contributions of low-level APs are relatively small.

Fig.2 shows the syllable duration APs of 5 tones, 82 
reduced base-syllable types, and 24 particular syllable-like 
types. As expected, Tone 3 is shorter and Tone 5 is shortened 
seriously. The APs of particular syllable-like units have 
similar dynamic range like those of normal-speech base-
syllables. Some base-syllables and particular syllable-like 
units are also shortened seriously like Tone 5. It is found that 
these acute shorten units are particles of “GE”, “O”, and 
uncertain pronunciation.

that the over-lengthening state has very large duration AP. It 
corresponds to the pronunciation of hesitation. From Fig. 4(b), 
one particular syllable-like prosodic state has very small 
energy AP. It corresponds to the deep pronunciation of

B. Analysis on Speech Flow 
1)  Normal Speech 
Table III lists the average lengths of PW, PPh, and BG/PG. 
Both the average lengths of PW and PPh were comparable to 
those of read speech [9], while the average length of BG/PG 
was much shorter. Two reasons caused BG/PGs to be shorter. 
One is that many speech turns are very short in this dialogue 
corpus. Another is due to the use of PPC in the structure of 
our prosody hierarchy. 
TABLE III: AVERAGE LENGTHS OF PW、PPH AND BG/PG. (UNIT:SYLLABLE) 
PW PPh BG/PG 
mean std mean Std mean std 
2.55 1.92 5.23 5.89 6.27 8.74
 
To explore the general patterns of syllable pitch contour, 
duration, and energy level for the high-level prosodic 
constituents (i.e. PW, PPh, and BG/PG) for normal speech, we 
first extract the prosodic state patterns from the observed 
syllable prosodic features by eliminating the influences of 
tone with coarticulation, base-syllable type, final type, and the 
global means. Since the prosodic state patterns are obtained in 
the same way for pitch, duration and energy modeling, we 
only present the exploration of the pitch patterns for simplicity. 
The pitch prosodic state patterns can be expressed by

n n t B+− −

Sequences of npm delimited by B2/B3/B4 at both sides are 
regarded as prosodic state patterns formed by integrating the 
log-F0 level patterns of the high-level prosodic constituents 
we considered. A superposition model is therefore defined by 
/n n n
r
n n PW PPh BG PG= + + +pm pm β β β                               (10) 
where rnpm  is the residual of log-F0 at syllable n; xβ  
represents APs of affecting factor x for log-F0; ( , )nPW i j= , 
 ( , )nPPh i j= , and / ( , )nBG PG i j=  denote that syllable n is 
located at the j-th place of an i-syllable PW, PPh, and BG/PG, 
respectively. A sequential optimization procedure based on 
the minimum mean squared error criterion is adopted to train 
the model. 
Fig. 8 displays log-F0 patterns of PW, PPh and BG/PG 
with different lengths. It is noted that the patterns with more 
instances are displayed in darker lines and dots. As shown in 
Fig. 8, both PW and PPh are of falling patterns in the range of 
0.1± . Moreover, longer PW and PPh have larger dynamic 
range. We also find that BG/PGs have flat patterns with small 
dynamic range. It is worth to note that the energy patterns of 
these three prosody constituents are very similar to those of 
log-F0 patterns. Fig. 9 displays syllable duration patterns of 
PW, PPh and BG/PG. It can be clearly observed from Fig. 9 
that the last syllables of all PPh and PW patterns were 
lengthened significantly, while those of most BG/PG patterns 
were shortened. These finding are similar to those of read 
speech. 
A typical prosody labeling example is given in Fig. 10. It 
can be found from the figure that the utterance is divided into 
many PWs of 1-4 syllables. Most PWs are delimited by B2-1 
with pitch reset. The insertion of the first B2-3 is due to 
hesitation. A major break B3 is set at the end of the first 
sentence. The speaker produces a DM (NE GE) with flat pitch 
and then followed by a PW “ji-long-yi-lan” with pitch accent 
to emphasize it. This example shows that our method 
functions very well for automatic prosody labeling.

ABSTRACT 
 
In this paper, a new approach to syllable-based modeling of F0 
contour, duration and energy for isolated Mandarin words is 
proposed. The syllable F0 contour model considers three major 
affecting factors, including lexical tone, syllable position in a word 
and inter-syllable coarticulation effect; while both the duration and 
energy models additionally consider one more affecting factor of 
base syllable type. Experimental results on a large single-speaker 
database showed that the method performed very well. Based on 
the prosodic model, a learning system for Mandarin word prosody 
pronunciation is designed and implemented for nonnative speakers.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Prosody modeling is an important research topic in text-to-speech 
(TTS). A well-designed prosodic model is the key to synthesize 
natural and pleasant speech. Currently, there are three major 
approaches of prosody modeling: rule-based, neural network-based 
and statistical model-based. The rule-based approach tries to 
generalize human’s prosody pronunciation rules from the linguistic 
point of view [1]. But, the rules are often too complicated to be 
exploited. The neural network-based approach imitates the learning 
and memorizing function of human brain. It progressively updates 
its network to learn the linguistics-prosody relationship [2]. It is 
criticized as a black box which is hard to analysis. The statistical 
model-based approach learns a model from a large corpus to build 
the relation between linguistic features and prosodic features [3]. 
In this paper, we adopt the statistical model-based approach to 
learn the prosody generation mechanism of isolated Mandarin 
words.  
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the proposed 
prosody modeling method is presented. In Section 3, experimental 
results are discussed. Some conclusions are given in Section 4. 
 
2. THE PROPOSED PROSODY MODELING METHOD 
In this study, we consider the modeling of three types of prosodic 
features including syllable log-F0 contour sp, syllable duration sd  
and syllable energy level (maximum energy of final) se. These 
three prosodic features are assumed to be independent of each 
other and their variation is controlled by four main affecting 
factors: lexical tone t , base syllable type s , syllable position in a 
word w  and coarticulation state c . The model can be generally 
expressed by

where ( | , , , )P sp t s w c , ( | , , , )P sd t s w c  and ( | , , , )P se t s w c  are 
syllable log-F0 contour, duration and energy models, respectively.  
 
2.1. Syllable F0 contour model 
We assume that the F0 contour of the n-th syllable (current syllable) 
in an isolated spoken word is mainly controlled by three affecting 
factors including the current lexical tone nt , the current syllable 
position in a word nw , and the coarticulations from the two nearest 
neighboring tones, 1nt −  and 1nt + , conditioned respectively on the 
coarticulation states, -1nc  and nc , of the syllable junctures on both 
sides. Here, coarticulation state nc  represents the degree of 
coupling between the n-th and (n+1)-th syllables in a word and is 
treated as hidden to be labeled. Specifically, the syllable F0 
contour is represented by

Fig. 3 displays the coarticulation APs, ,

c tpβ  and ,
b
c tpβ , of F0. 
Generally, it can be found from the figure that the APs of c3 were 
close to flat lines to show its characteristic of “weak” coupling, 
while most APs of c1 were bent more seriously in the beginning or 
ending parts to compensate the mismatch of connecting two F0 
patterns across “tightly” coupled juncture. We also find that 
forward coarticulation APs were generally more seriously bended 
than backward coarticulation ones. This conforms with the findings 
of [6]. Moreover, we find that the well-known 3-3 tone sandhi rule 
was properly learned by the proposed model. As shown in Fig. 3(b), 
the backward coarticulation APs of (3,3) were upward bended 
drastically. This can make the reconstructed F0 pattern of the first 
tone-3 in (3,3) resemble the standard tone-2 pattern. As for the 
coarticulation APs of duration and energy, they were all small and 
less influential.

for 16 tone pairs and 3 coarticulation states. c1: solid line, c2: dash 
line and c3: dotted line;. tpn=(i,j): tone pair. 
 
Fig. 4 displays the syllable position-in-word AP of F0. It can 
be clearly observed from Fig. 4(a)~(d) that the syllable pitch level 
in all four types of polysyllabic word decreased to show the 
declination effect. We also find that the dynamic range of syllable 
pitch level increased as the word length increased. Moreover, we 
find that the patterns of APs for the first two syllables in 3- to 5-
syllable words had similar shape with that of bi-syllabic word.

syllabic words; and (e)/(f) comparisons of APs for the first/last 
syllables in polysyllabic words. (i,j) means the j-th syllable of i-
syllabic word. 
 
Fig. 5 displays the syllable position-in-word APs of duration 
and energy. It is found from Fig. 5(a) that the ending syllables in 
all four types of polysyllabic words were much longer than others 
to show the well-known lengthening effect. We also find from Fig. 
5(b) that the syllable energy level of all four types of word tended 
to decline straightly to show the declination effect.

energy model. 
 
We then analyzed the base syllable APs, sγ and sα , of 
duration and energy by CART. Some interesting phenomena were 
found: syllables with initial in {b,d,g} are shorter; syllables with 
nasal ending are longer; syllables pronounced by opening mouth 
have larger energy; syllables with single vowel have smaller 
energy; etc. These results match with the prior linguistic 
knowledge. 
Table 2 displays the total residual error (TRE) defined as the 
ratio of sum-squared values of residual and observed features. It is 
found that TRE reduced as more APs were considered. Besides, it 
is found that lexical tone, position-in-word and base syllable had 
the most significant APs for the three models of syllable log-F0 
contour, duration and energy, respectively.
