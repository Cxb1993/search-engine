Abstract 
The radiation emission in the near field and far zones from antenna are obtained by treating lines 
on PCBs as transmission lines (TMLs) and antenna as open TMLs, and then calculating the 
near-field and far-field emission due to current distribution on lines. In the first year, we 
presented precise circuit model, based on traditional TMLs model, but it considers the finite size 
ground and antenna, to study the radiated emission and to find the sub-circuit of the radiated 
source. In the second year, we presented using the imperfect ground-plane of the Notebook to 
improve the isolation of antenna, in order to reduce the Noise Floor. The theory of Balun was 
used to analyze and confirm the measurement results.

一、 前言 
近年來，由於無線通訊的迅速發展，人們對無線通
訊的類型和品質的要求越來越高。使用多天線技術將可
提高傳輸速率和可靠性，其中 MIMO(Multiple-input-
multiple-output)系統藉由發射端的多天線各自發射不同
信號，在接收端各自接收從發射端發出的不同訊號，在
使用數位訊號處理(DSP)處理，不同的訊號就會還原回
來，但是多天線的設置將造成信號互相干擾，影響信號
的關聯度，較高的關聯度會造成資料傳輸速率下降，其
中關聯度正比於 S12，因此提升天線隔離度就可降低關
聯度[1][2]，造成天線隔離度的好壞直接影響到 MIMO
系統的效能。對應到以往的文獻中，兩支天線的間距必
須大於 0.5λ0，隔離度才可達到-20dB 以下[3]，如今無線
通訊產品要求輕、薄、短、小的外型，以狹小手機空間
為例，恐怕將找不到安置天線的位置，因此本論文主要
是在天線間距只有 0.04λ０的環境，利用非理想接地面，
以及 Baluns 的設計方式對天線隔離度進行分析研究。

To obtain dual-band power divider of the parameters, 
then using the AppCAD software calculate a

In this paper proposed the equation and the steps to 
complete the dual-band power divider of wireless 
communication systems. The dual-band power divider 
as mentioned above, based on the slow-wave theory, 
in the transmission line structure to chisel slot to 
reduce the occupied space. Design a dual-band power 
divider for mobile phone system. Mobile phone 
system according to GSM-band (880MHz ~ 960MHz) 
taken as the 920MHz center frequency and DCS 
(1710MHz ~ 1880MHz) band taken as the 1795MHz 
center frequency for the design. The dual-band quasi 
Wilkinson power divider has been fabricated on a 1.6-
mm-thick FR4 substrate, which has a relative 
permittivity of 4.3 and a conductor thickness of 
0.03mm.

III. EXPERIMENE 
The dual-band power divider is designed for mobile 
phone system application. The center frequency of 
GSM-band (880MHz ~ 960MHz) is 920MHz and in 
DCS (1710MHz ~ 1880MHz) is 1795MHz. Therefore, 
according to (1), the length of the two sections of 
transmission line is λ184.021 == LL , using (2)and 
(3),  the characteristic impedance of  two sections of 
transmission lines can be determined as Ω= 6.791Z  
and Ω= 7.622Z . The shunt resistance, capacitance 
and inductance between the two output ports can be 
calculated as Ω=100R 、 nHL 8.13= and 
pFC 1.1= using (12)and (13). Simulation with 
models of real lumped components and the real 
substrate has been done applying the software Anaoft 
HFSS. The simulated S-parameters are presented in 
Fig. 2. Return loss value is less than -10dB as the 
standard, there is a good agreement, such as equal 
power split, impedance matching at all ports and a 
good isolation between the two output ports can be 
fulfilled at two different frequencies simultaneously.

IV. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we present dual-band power divider 
based on the slow-wave theory and transmission line 
with slot to reduce the occupied space, and the 
occupied space is effectively reduced about 37.6%. 
The input signal is divided almost equally and to 
transfer to the output ports, both at 920MHz and 
1795MHz, a good isolation between ports 2 and 3 is 
also fulfilled at these two frequencies.

III. MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENT 
Isotropic EM field strength meters (broadband survey 
meters) are specified as the prime instrument in the method.
The general requirements of the instrument are referred to [2].  
If the measured field strength is higher or close to the 
maximum permission exposure (MPE) [7] and several sources 
with different frequencies exist. Then, a spectrum analyzer 
with appropriate antenna (narrow-band systems) could be 
served as the measurement instrument.  The measurement 
results are summed with the equation below [7].

Where E is the measured electric field strength; H is the 
measured magnetic field strength; P is the measured power 
density. The summations must be less than one for compliance 
with the safety standard.  Although, the narrowband system is 
regarded as an auxiliary instrument, it is allowed to be used 
directly for the measurement. In the European standard [6], 
the evaluation approaches are divided into case A and case B. 
Case A provides a single result covering all sources and 
frequencies. Case B provides a set of field values for sources, 
frequencies or frequency sub-bands. Case A and case B use 
broadband equipment and frequency selective equipment 
respectively. Case A may be used to indicate if it is necessary 
to perform a case B assessment. Evaluation shall be completed 
according to case B when the measured power density is 
above a threshold of 10 mW/m2. The method we proposed and 
[6] specify the similar instrument, while the specified 
thresholds are different.   
IV. SELECTION OF MEASUREMENT POINTS 
For base stations measurement, one important issue is to 
clearly define where and how many points needed to be 
measured (sampling). Based on the EM measurement 
principles and for reducing controversy between different 
parties, the method defines the measurement points not only 
considering the type of the transmitting antenna and the 
operating frequency but also reflecting the requests of the 
residents. 
A. AM broadcast Stations
Most of the AM transmitting antennas are omnidirectional 
monopole antennas.  Therefore, we define a measurement area, 
which is between two circles as shown in Fig. 1.  The radius 
of the small circle is the nearest distance, which the general 
public can reach.  For the antenna without any protection, the 
radius is 20 cm from the antenna.  The radius of the large 
circle is /4 of the carrier.  In the measurement area, the test 
performer can define any two orthogonal lines, and take 5 
measurement points with equal spacing on the lines as shown 
in Fig. 2.  Although it is predictable the field strength 
decreases rapidly with the distance from the antennas. 
Nevertheless, buildings or big obstacles are often found near 
the antennas and standing wave might exist.  Therefore the 
/4 distance is chosen to avoid missing any high field strength 
area. Both of the electric and magnetic field must be measured 
since the measurements are taken in the near field region.
Figure 2. Measurement points of AM broadcast stations. 
B. FM and TV broadcast stations 
Most of the transmitting antennas of FM and TV base 
stations are directional. The points are chosen with equal 
spacing on the three lines within the 3 dB beamwidth area
as shown in Fig. 3.  The farthest distance of the 
measurement area is 50 m from the antenna since it is
predictable the maximum field will happens in this area 
for most of the antenna types [3]. Both horizontal and 
vertical polarization field must be measured.

shown in Fig. 6b.  It is clear that the highest field strength 
happens at the location several meters away from the antennas, 
not at the place right below the antennas (the closest place), 
which is as expected.  The field distribution is complicated as 
shown in Fig. 6b.  Fig. 6c is a 3D graph to help understanding 
of the field distribution.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS
Although most of the EM field strength radiated from base 
stations can be roughly predicted by theory.  However, the 
real environment always deviate from the ideal model, this 
makes the measurement more necessary.  We drafted an easy-
to-follow measurement method to help the test performer take 
meaningful measurement results.  This method is adopted by 
the EPA in Taiwan.  And, a widely safety survey of base 
stations, based on this method, has already performed for 
years. A lot of base stations have been measured. The results 
are open on the website. We hope this effort can satisfy the 
requirements from most of the residents. By comparing the 
European standards and our method, we found that both were 
similar in instruments selection, while in samplings were 
different. In addition, some inadequacies were found in the 
method we proposed, for example, the estimation of the field 
strength at the maximum traffic situation. Based on these 
findings, we will start to modify our method in the near future.

slot antenna has a directional radiation, it is also suitable to be designed into a dual-polarized
antenna for horizontal and vertical polarization, as shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, respectively. To
excite the two polarizations simultaneously, two antennas feeding by the perpendicular to each
other must be used. As shown in Fig. 2 that feeding from port 1 (50Ω terminal load in port 2), a
vertical polarization is excited in the left CPW structure. On the contrary, when feeding from port
2 (terminate 50Ω load in port 1), a horizontal polarization is excited in the right CPW structure,
as shown in Fig. 3. The antenna is an attractive candidate for multiple band antenna applications
that require polarization diversity and also for some of the MIMO systems applications.

High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS). The antenna has also been fabricated and measured.

4. CONCLUSION
A Dual Polarization coplanar waveguide (CPW)-fed bow-tie slot antenna for broadband commu-
nications has been proposed and tested. The antenna structure is brought by the embedded slot
with a pair of stubs and combined two antennas at the scattered CPW feeding on both left and
right sides, it can be obtained a much wider impedance bandwidth, dual-polarization and high iso-
lation. Measured performance of the developed antenna includes −10 dB reflection coefficient, with
the bandwidths of 4.7GHz (461%) and 4.74GHz (476%) for the two polarizations. The isolation
between two ports in the required band is lower than −20 dB. From simulated and measured radi-
ation patterns, the signals received by the two ports are proved to be uncorrelated. The radiation
efficiency is better than 56% and 57%, and the peak gain is better than 2.5 and 3.3 dBi. Although

Abstract— In this paper, a novel broadband Fractal circular-monopole antenna is presented.
This antenna consists of printed circular iteration with two iterating level and ground-plane
with radius 25mm, making it easy to making it easy to combine directional, high gain and
wide bandwidth. A prototype is designed to operate at 1.5GHz–5.86GHz, the measured 10 dB
bandwidth is nearly 1 : 2 at the center frequency of 3.775GHz. Experimental results are shown
to verify the validity of theoretical work. Fractal monopole antenna is formed with hollow of
circle, which featuring of multi-frequency bands and wide bands.
1. INTRODUCTION
The Sierpinski triangle, also called the Sierpinski gasket or the Sierpinski Sieve, is a fractal named
after the Polish mathematician Waclaw Sierpinski who described it in year 1916 [1]. Fractal antenna
engineering is the field, which utilizes fractal geometries for antenna design. It has become one of
the growing field of antenna engineering due to its particular characteristics and advantages over
conventional antenna design. An algorithm of the Sierpinski triangle as follows: Any triangle in
a plane and canonical Sierpinski triangle uses an equilateral triangle with a base parallel to the
horizontal axis (first image). Reduce the size of the triangle to 1/2 height and 1/2 width, make
three copies, and position the three shrunken triangles so that each triangle touches the other two
triangles at a corner. Note the emergence of the central hole — because the three shrunken triangles
between them can cover only 3/4 of the area of the original. (Central Holes are an important feature
and rule of Sierpinski’s triangle). Repeat step 2 with each of the smaller triangles (image 3 and so
on). In Fig. 1 was shown iterate level.
For the typical Sierpinski gasket configuration, the patch dimensions from 88.9mm×88.9mm to
800mm ground plane, a triangle generator with a scale fractal ratio of 1/2 is slotted in the triangle
patch to form the monopole antenna [2]. For the modified Sierpinski gasket with 88.9mm × 88.9
patch and 25 cm × 25 cm ground plane, a circular generator with a non-constant fractal ratio
depending on the Descartes circle theorem is slotted in the triangle patch to form the monopole
antenna [3]. Most of the fractal geometries have the characteristics mentioned as above, with various
periods that form of fractal structure dimension and self-similarity. Utilization the Sierpinski
gasket or carpet geometries characteristic of fractals can be improved and used to design both
type of monopole and dipole antennas [4–8]. It has become one of the growing fields of antenna
engineering due to its advantages over conventional antenna design. The results suggest a method
for perturbing the Sierpinski structure in such way as to control the position of multiple bands
where is necessary.

We’ve designed the circular-shaped of monopole antenna based on the Sierpinski gasket geometry
are mode in the antenna in order to improve the width-band and radiation pattern, the circular
fractal was printed on FR4 and mounted over a radius of 25mm circle ground plane. The structure
was fed through a 1.5mm diameter, 50Ω coaxial probe with a SMA connector on the bottom side
of the circle plane. The geometrical structure and dimensions of the proposed monopole circular-
shaped has constructed through three iterations in this particular case and circular disc, Sierpinski
gasket and carpet is known as a shelf similar fractals.
Antennas are designed and simulated by using Ansoft HFSS and a prototype is fabricated,
the antenna return loss and VSWR is measured, using the Agilent 8753ES Network Analyzer to
measure and simulate it responses in 1-6GHz frequency range is demonstrated in Fig. 6. The result
we had from simulated and measured test is similar while we observed. It is known from Fig. 6,
that to perform width-band characteristics and the second iteration antenna structure covering the
frequency range from 1.5GHz to 6GHz is best among them. A actual return loss and VSWR is
better than −10 dB and < 2 in 1.5GHz to 6GHz in 2nd iteration mode.
3. HELPFUL HINTS
The antenna is built in a monopole configuration over an 25mm radius of circle ground plane, and
antenna structured height 54mm with FR4 substrate (thickness = 0.8mm, εr = 4.0). A fifty-ohm
coaxial probe directly feeds the driven SMA connector. The resonances the circular-shaped of
fractal monopole antenna including 1st and 2nd type of return loss, are shown in Fig. 7(a). In 1st
of iteration return loss, the bandwidth and resonances are slightly matching impedance. As the
2nd of iteration, the resonances are very remarkable increased and rich multi-band responses occur
in the S11 spectrum. The measured gain of the antenna at the 1st and 2nd iterations band is given
in Fig. 7(b). The table shows the fractal antenna peak gain on 1st and 2nd iterations frequencies
resonance point, respectively. The measured antenna gain against frequency and offers a peak gain
of 1st and 2nd iterations, it was apparent peak gain that the 2nd iteration more than before models
on the same scope.
This 2nd of iteration was appeared multi- and width range from 1.5GHz∼6GHz for all ISM
band requirement applications. The radiation pattern of iterations antenna were measured inside
a 3D anechoic chamber.
The main cuts measured radiation patterns of the antenna at 1st and 2nd iterations are shown in
Fig. 8. All the popular bands measured of antenna radiation patterns appear at the same position
that shows the radiation patterns of iterations antennas in the X/Y/Z planes, respectively. The
patterns are observed to be nearly Omni-directional in the H-plane, and resonance frequencies span
are illustrated in Fig. 8.

tual example, as the Sierpinski fractal geometry into circular structure, use HFSS simulate software
to test and analysis, it shows the result is match to fractal characteristic.
All of them describe a multiband behavior of fractal antenna. This behavior is consistent from
