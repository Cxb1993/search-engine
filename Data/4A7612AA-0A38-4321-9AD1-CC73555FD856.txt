higher temperature region and diffusion of water 
vapor driven truly enhanced the temperature 
increasing rate in the inner layer at the latter 
steaming process. Although the heat transfer rate is 
slower than that in steaming, the phenomenon is 
similar. However, a high negative condensation level 
(i.e., evaporation) was observed during the process 
in the region near the surface and that lead to dryer 
and brown surface of the steamed bun. Simulation 
results indicated that these coupled models can 
perform similar temperature profile with an average 
error of 7%. The implications of these models may be 
useful for understanding heat and mass transfer model 
of superheated steaming of porous food using 
superheated steam and then set up a good quality 
assessment when compared to steaming in this water 
oven.

1. Introduction 
Chinese steamed bun is a steamed bread, 
prepared from fermented dough steaming in 
bamboo steamer or a high power rice cooker. 
Gluten is set to form a porous structure during 
steaming process. In our previous study, steamed 
bun was used as a model porous food for  
steaming reheating, which is well modeled in a 
good agreement with temperature predictions. 
Superheated steam is widely used and studied 
for drying and pasteurization in food industry 
(Chang et al., 1991; Huang et al., 2004; 
Cenkowski et al., 2007; Nygaard and Hostmark, 
2008; Isobe et al., 2011). Although it can prevent 
from oxidation due to oxygen of absence, the 
food quality may be undermined due to the high 
temperature for a short time. Therefore, it is 
essential to establish a general model for the heat 
and mass transfer mechanism during superheated 
steaming.  
So far, superheated steaming is still an 
unexploded field in modeling that involved with 
energy and moisture transport in porous food. 
Frydman et al. (1999) simulated the spray drying 
in superheated steam using computational fluid 
dynamics. Their model described momentum, 
heat and mass transfer between two phases 
through a finite volume method. Blasco and 
Alvarez (1999) also considered the similar 
equations to solved the flash drying to the 
moisture removal of fishmeal using superheated 
steam. The computational results were in 
agreement with the experimental data. Gomez et 
al.(2009) developed a Eulerian model including 
the kinetic theory of granular flow and mass 
transfer to simulate continuous drying of 
particulate solids using superheated steam in a 
radial impingement jet system. This model 
provided a better understanding of the dynamics 
and control of the process. Recently, some 
researcher compared the effects of different 
cooking methods. For example, the weight loss 
of the hot air with steam for pork was 
significantly higher than in the other cooking 
methods while the color of the surface was paler 
than the other ones (Vittadin et al., 2005). 
Chiavaro et al. (2006) cooked the pork in a 
Combi-Steal SL oven with different treatments. 
Results showed that cooked products in forced 
convection mixed with the superheated steam at 
120 and 140 °C were paler (on the upper surface) 
and less tender than samples in radiation also 
exhibiting a significantly higher cooking loss 
and lower water holding capacity. 
In this work, mathematical models for 
predicting the temperature history of porous 
foods (steamed buns) during superheated steam 
reheating in a commercial "water oven" were 
developed, and simulated in finite element 
software. After that we can compared the results 
of superheated steam to various heating methods 
in the oven. 
 
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
2.1 Mathematical model 
 
In this study, molecular diffusion is suggested to 
taken into account in modeling of vapor 
diffusion combined with heat transfer and mass 
transfer of condensed liquid. These mechanisms 
are mathematically described by following 
differential equations (Eq.1-3). The model for 
heat transfer by conduction and convection in 
the steamed bun domain is the simple energy 
balance equation (Eq. 1). The migration behavior 
of condensed water in the steamed bun is a 
 4 
 
coefficient can be calculated from the inverse 
method, the conjugate gradient method. 
 
2.3 HEATING SYSTEM AND 
EXPERIMENT PROCEDURE 
 
The "water oven" (Sharp Healsio AX-1300T, 
Thailand) is a multifunctional thermal process 
device for many kinds of food cooking methods, 
1,400W power, with inner dimensions: 
350×335×227 mm3. There is a steam tubing in 
the back of the water oven for generating the 
needed steam. The experiment sample was 
placed in the center area closed to the door of 
water oven for clear observation on the sample 
surface during superheated steaming. 
Temperature was measured by J type 
thermocouple (Ø 3mm) with NI acquisition 
system (NI USB-9219, Texas). The 
thermocouples were calibrated by the handheld 
dry-wells instrument (Fluke 9100S, Everett) in 
the range [30-150°C]. All the thermocouples 
provide ±0.5°C accuracy. The whole system is 
operated by a program created under LabVIEW 
8.6 (National Instruments, Texas). Then, the 
simulation was performed using the commercial 
software program COMSOL Multiphysics and 
validated with the experiment data. 
To identify the saturation state of the 
environment of water oven in the mode of 
superheated steam, the absolute humidity inside 
the oven must be confirmed. AH-200-1 
transmitter including a AH-300 humidity sensor 
that consists of two matched negative 
temperature coefficient thermistors: one is 
encapsulated in dry nitrogen, the other is 
exposed to the environment. When voltage is 
applied, heat is dissipated from the sealed 
thermistor resulting in operation at a lower 
temperature than the exposed element. The 
difference in temperature between the two 
thermistors is proportional to the absolute 
humidity of the surrounding environment 
measured in grams per cubic meter or grains per 
pound. Fig. 1 shows the result of humidity in the 
mode of superheated steaming at different oven 
temperature. It indicated that the discontinuously 
supplied vapor resulted in intermittent smaller 
absolute humidity (from 80 to 100 g/m3), and 
each corresponded relative humidity was below 
the 15%, i.e. far from its saturation point. Thus, 
vapor tended to reach the state of saturation, and 
condensed water was soon evaporated due to the 
unsaturated vapor state outside. This was 
validated that the total weight had no change that 
resulted from increase of moisture content 
during this heating. However, we still can 
observe that the condensation occurred at the 
surface of the steamed bun in this heating mode.

that with the condition of saturated vapor 
continuously supplied on bun's surface and 
vaporization in outer layer of the bun while 
temperature increasing, the vapor transmitted the 
energy responsible for rapid enthalpy increase in 
the steamed buns. That also increased 5% water 
content of the steamed bun. In the case of 
superheated steaming, the weight of the steamed 
bun had a little decrease due to water 
evaporation near the surface layer. It also 
explained that the temperature rising rate of 
superheated steaming was slower than that of 
steaming. Here, we observed that center 
temperature rising rate of steamed bun was 
slower in the early baking process(fig. 4 b); 
however, the rising rate of the radish cake didn't 
have this phenomenon. It suggested that the 
water at the surface layer was evaporated to 
vapor and vapor flow towards outside lead to 
vapor pressure drops during baking process. 
Then the pressure gradient forced slight 
evaporation in inner region, which led to slower 
temperature rising rate.

and superheated steaming of the steamed bun.

and superheated steaming of the steamed bun. 
 
As shown in figure 5, it is clear that 
experimental temperature for steamed bun w/o 
PE wrapped was in good agreement with 
predicted value using the model discussed here. 
This finding was reported in previous NSC plan 
because the experimental data suggest the 
presence of an evaporation/ condensation 
mechanism in the coupled heat and mass transfer, 
which should result in a steep sigmoidal shape of 
the heating curve. However, the average error of 
the predicted temperature of steamed bun in 
superheated steaming using the same boundary 
was approximately 22%, which indicated that 
more complex ambient boundary interaction 
should be considered (Eq. 5-8).

temperatures as a function of time for a steamed

to oven heating. The temperature profiles (fig. 4) 
well explained the phenomena as described 
previously. Here, we observed that center 
temperature rising rate of steamed bun was 
slower in the early baking process than that in 
superheated steaming (fig. 4); It suggested that 
the more water at the surface layer was 
evaporated to vapor and vapor flow towards 
outside lead to vapor pressure drops during 
baking process. Then the pressure gradient 
forced slight evaporation in inner region, which 
led to slower temperature rising rate. 
 
4. Conclusion 
In the case of superheated steaming, the weight 
of the steamed bun had a little decrease due to 
water evaporation near the surface layer. It also 
explained that the temperature rising rate of 
superheated steaming was slower than that of 
steaming. These findings suggest that the 
increase in the partial vapor pressure in the 
higher-temperature region and the diffusion of 
water vapor enhanced the rate of temperature 
increase in the core region during these heating 
processes. Simulation also validated that the 
water at the surface layer was evaporated to 
vapor and most vapor flow towards outside lead 
to less decrease of the total weight during 
superheated steaming process. Then the pressure 
gradient forced slight condensation in inner 
region, which was similar with that in steaming 
process and led to slower temperature rising rate. 
Finally, water mobility, in forms of liquid and 
vapor, enhances heat transfer rate in reheating of 
a porous starchy food.

一、參加會議經過 
參加會議經過 
    本次會議為  2012 EUROFOODWATER 舉辦的 7th International Conference on 
Water in Food.，於 6 月 3 日至 6 月 5 日在芬蘭首都赫爾辛基舉行。會議地點辦
在 Scandic Continental Hotel。Hotel 內部總共有四到五個會議廳加上位於電車線上及
機場巴士線上，是很多商務人士及研討會選擇舉辦的地點，此研討會有別以往的大
型研討會，其邀稿日期到會議舉辦日之間的時間僅僅只有兩個月，屬於小型但專精
的研討會，整個議程都在一個會議廳內舉行，三天的議程中第一天卻是在晚上報到
也是很第一次遇到，而海報展示區則是在會場後方。這次學術會議，亞洲很少教授
與學生來參與，大多是歐洲人而最遠的則是來自澳洲的博士生，不同於本人擅長的

很多可取之處，可惜學弟不能親臨現場請對方指教相關細節等。由於之前有在亞洲
及美國報告過，本次研討會應該會駕輕就熟，但某些歐洲學校的演講，仍有來自中
亞甚至其他國家的學生，在中間休息時間的互相討教下還是有些語言上的溝通困難‧ 
這次在比較自己與其他的研究成果時，覺得深度與精采程度都算有水準，只是
在場觀眾的興趣專長較為偏好食品化學方面，雖然只有主持人跟計時者有提問，但
學者等人給本人的意見仍是針對水分上有著相當關鍵的提問。只是因為儀器方面受
限，水分含量的實時驗證只能粗糙的呈現與解釋給學者聽。總結來說，此次感受最
深的，莫過於是歐洲研討會雖然小可是互動遠比去美國來得多，而友善程度也相對
很高。  
三、建議 
本次參加這小型的歐洲研討會，原以為重點大多呈現在展場跟學術上，但仍學
到一件重要的國際觀，一位來自澳洲的博士生對於未來的展望，這場小型研討會有
很多都是念博士班的，並會不怕陌生的主動靠近教授們聊天並遞上名片，在詢問過
老師之後，才知道他們是在建立關係並尋求以後的工作機會，在交換名片後或者給
對方認識自己才有機會進入最該領域最核心的研究團隊，如此在學術上更能快速的
站有一席之地，這點在台灣舉辦的很多研討會就比較少看到，而另一個就是公司，
可以注意到有些演講是主辦單位中協辦或贊助單位支援的研究機構，這類演講相對
來得專業，在儀器的研發上也比學術來得更商業化，而專精於食品化學領域的人才
便會在演講後與廠商代表聊天商談未來工作機會，而研討會中除了休息時間提供的
點心都相較於大型研討會來得更佳，附帶的背包等旅遊地圖對比繳交的註冊費都來
得划算，因此除了美國的研討會外，多去更不同的國家參加研討會更能拓展國際視
