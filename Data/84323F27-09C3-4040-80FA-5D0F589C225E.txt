A n-type Si as the substrate was first pretreated for the surface cleaning, including two steps : 
1. cleaning in an acetone solution with ultrasonic vibration for 15 min. and washing with deionized 
water, 2. pickling in a solution of H2SO4/H2O2 (3:1) for 15 min. and then washing with deionized 
water. 
 The cleaned Si was then treated for the preparation of Si nanowires. The treating process has 
three steps: 1. immersing in a solution of 1% HF for 30 sec. for removing the oxide layer, 2. 
immersing in a solution of 8.5% HF and 25mM AgNO3 for preparing the Si nanowire on Si substrate, 
3. immersing in a solution of 30% HNO3 for 15 min. for removing the Ag layer on Si nanowires. 
 The Si nanowires on surface could be deposited with Pd nanoparticles. The process for the 
deposited of Pd nanoparticles on the surface of Si includes five steps: 1. immersing in a solution of 
1% HF for 30 sec. for removing the oxide layer, 2. immersing in a solution of 1% surfactant for 30 
sec., 3. immersing in a solution of 40g/L SnCl2 and 40mL/L HCl for 2 min. for sensitizing the surface 
of Si nanowires , 4. immersing in a solution of 0.15g/L PdCl2 amd 3mL/L HCl for 30 sec. for 
activating the surface of Si nanowires and 5. repeating the step from 2 to 4 for 3~5 times for 
depositing the Pd nanoparticles on the surface of Si nanowires. 
 The Si nanowires on Si surface could be also electrolessly deposited with Ni nanoparticles. 
The electroless bath consists 30 g/L NiSO4·6H2O and 35 g/L NiSO4·6H2O, 84g/L Na3C6H5O7·2H2O, 
15g/L NaH2PO2·H2O, 70 ℃ and pH 9, respectively. Before electroless plating, the Si nanowires 
should be treated by the steps of 1~3 described above. 
 For formation of NiSi between Si nanowires and electroless Ni deposit, the Si nanowire 
deposited with Ni nanoparticles was annealed in a rapid thermal annealing (RTA) furnace at 400 ℃ 
for 5 min. under vacuum. After annealed, the specimen was immersed in a solution of 5% or 15% 
HNO3 for 10, 20, or 30 sec. to remove the unreacted Ni deposits. 
 For obtaining electrode catalyst Pt nanoparticles with a smaller size uniformly deposited on 
the surface of Si nanowires. The Si nanowires and H2PtCl6·6H2O were put in ethylene glycol for a 
reflux at 120 ℃ for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours, respectively. After rinsing, the Si nanowires deposited with Pt 
particles  were dried at 100 ℃ for 2 hours. 
 A scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL- JSEM 6360) was used to observe the surface 
and cross section morphologies of specimens. The phase and structure of the specimens were 
analyzed by using an X-ray diffractometer. A 200kV field emission scanning transmission electron 
microscope (STEM, JEOL JEM-2100F ) were used for the observation of microstructure of the Pt, Pd 
and Ni nanoparticles.A measurement system for (photoelectron conversion efficiency) was used to 
measure the photoelectron conversion efficiency (η) of the photoelectrochemical solar cell under 
standard AM 1.5 simulated sunlight (100mWcm-2). The photoelectrochemical solar cell had a 
structure of Si nanowires/electrolyte/Pt in which Si nanowires had been deposited Pt nanoparticles, 
Pd nanoparticles or Ni nanoparticles , and electrolyte was 0.5 M KNO3 + 0.1 M K3[Fe(CN)6]+0.1 M 
K4[Fe(CN)6]. 
 
Results and discussions 
 For preparing Si nanowires with better quality, four different solutions were used, i.e ,8.5% 
HF + 20mM AgNO3, 8.5% HF + 25mM AgNO3, 10% HF + 20mM AgNO3, and 10%HF + 25mM 
AgNO3. The results showed that all Si nanowires have a diameter below 100nm and agglomerate at 
the upper part. The surface morphology of Si nanowires prepared in a solution of 8.5%HF + 25mM 
AgNO3 was shown in Fig.1. The magnifications of Fig. 1 (a),(b),(c), and (d) are different and 
(a)<(b)<(c)<(d) in magnification. Fig.2 showed the cross section morphologies of Si nanowires 
prepared in a solution of 8.5%HF + 25mM AgNO3 for 10 (a), 15 (b), 20 (c), and 30min.(d). The 
length of Si nanowires is about 2.8, 4.3, 5.2, and 8.1m for preparing time of 10, 15, 20, and 30 min., 
respectively. The Si nanowires prepared in the solution of 8.5% HF + 25mM AgNO3 are relatively 
uniform in length. 
In the preparing process for Si nanowires , the Ag+(aq) would obtain electron from the Si 
substrate and deposited as Ag metal on the substrate surface. At the same time, the Si around the Ag

 Fig. 3 showed the cross section morphology of Si nanowires with Pd metal deposited by five 
repeats of sensitizing and activating for the upper part(a) and the lower part. It can be seen that the 
upper part of Si nanowires has a layer of Pd film on its surface, and the surface of lower part has little 
Pd metal. Fig. 4 showed TEMviews of morphologies of Si nanowires with Pd metal deposited by 
three repeats of sentizing and activating. It can be seen that there are Pd particles deposited on te 
surface of Si nanowires. The Pd particles have a diameter about 5 nm, as shown in Fig. 4 (b). The 
cross section morphologies of Si nanowires with Ni metal deposited in an electroless bath containing 
35 g/L NiSO4·6H2O were shown in Fig.5 (a) for the upper part and (b) for the lower part. Fig.5(a) 
showed that there is a Ni metal on the surface of the upper part and the Ni metal on the surface of the 
lower part is relatively little. Fig. 6 showed TEMviews of morphologies of Si nanowires with Ni 
metal deposited in an electroless bath containing 35 g/L NiSO4·6H2O. It can be seen that Ni particles 
deposited on te surface of Si nanowires. These Ni particles have a diameter about 10-30 nm, as shown 
in Fig. 6 (b). Fig. 7 showed TEMviews of morphologies of Si nanowires with Pt metal deposited in an 
ethylene glycol bath containing H2PtCl6·6H2O for a reflux at 120 ℃ for 3 hour. The single Pd particle 
is about 5 nanometers large and the Pd particles tend to aggregate in clusters. The TEM diffraction 
pattern of the sample in Fig. 7a is shown in Fig. 7b. The pattern is formed by tiny Pd particles.

 In the process for Ni metal electrolessly deposited on the surface of Si nanowires, the 
(H2PO2-(aq)) would be oxidized into H2PO3-(aq) and the Ni2+(aq) would be reduced into Ni0(s) under 
the catalysis of Pd. The reactions for the Ni deposition can be written as follows. 
 
 H2PO2-(aq) + H2O    H2PO3-(aq) + 2H+(aq) + 2e-  ------------------ Anodic reaction 
         Ni2+(aq) + 2e-     Ni0(s)  ------------------------------------------------- Cathodic reaction 
and   H2PO2-(aq) + H2O + Ni2+(aq)    H2PO3-(aq) + 2H+(aq) + Ni0(s)-- Total reaction  
 
 The XRD patterns of Si nanowires with Ni metal deposited in an electroless bath containing 
35 g/L NiSO4.6H2O were shown in Fig.8 for as-deposited state (a), annealed at 400 ℃ for 5 min.(b), 
annealed and then etched in 15% HNO3 for 10 sec (c), annealed and then etched in 15% HNO3 for 20 
sec (d), and annealed and then etched in 15% HNO3 for 30 sec (e). it can be seen that the XRD peak at 
56° is quite sharp, which reveals the Si nanowires are crystalline, and the XRD peak at about 45° in (a) 
is quite broad, which demonstrates the Ni metal on the surface of Si nanowises is almost amorphous, 
i.e, the grains of the Ni metal are very small and about several nanometers in size. The XRD patterns 
of (b) showed that the broad peak at about 45° has almost disappeared and be replaced by some weak 
but sharp peaks, which reveals the Ni metal would react with the Si to form NiXSi1-x after annealed at 
400  for 5 min. After etched in 15% HNO℃ 3, the XRD peaks at 42~ 48° in (c), (d), and (e) became 
more sharper than (b), which reveals the residual Ni metal has been etched by HNO3.

Conclusions 
For the photoelectrochemical solar cell with a structure of Si nanowire 
anode/[Fe(CN)6]4-(aq)-[Fe(CN)6]3-(aq) electrolyte /Pt cathode, its total photoelectron conversion 
efficiency can be slightly increased when the Si nanowires were electrolessly deposited with Pd 
nanoparticles and can be greatly increased when the Si nanowires deposited with Pt and Ni 
nanoparticles. The annealing at 400 ℃ for 5 min, etching in HNO3 solution , and additional 
deposition of Pd metal for the anode of Si nanowires deposited with Ni metal have not significant 
effects on the total photoelectron conversion efficiency of the photo electrochemical solar cell.

Abstract 
 
Various structures of Cu (50nm)/ Ru (2nm)/ MgO (0.5~3nm)/ Ta (2nm)/ Si were prepared by 
sputtering and electroplating techniques, in which the ultra-thin trilayer of Ru (2nm)/ MgO 
(0.5~3nm)/ Ta (2nm) is used as the diffusion barrier against the interdiffusion between Cu film and 
Si substrate. The various structures of Cu/Ru/MgO/Ta/Si were characterized by four-point probes 
for their sheet resistances, by X-ray diffractometers for their crystal structures, by scanning electron 
microscopes for their surface morphologies, and by transmission electron microscopes for their 
cross-section and high resolution views. The results showed that the as deposited MgO and Ta 
layers are amorphous. The failure of the diffusion barrier is due that the Ru layer first become 
discontinuous, then the Cu atoms diffuse to Si substrate at the discontinuities, the Cu3Si phase form, 
and the diffusion barrier finally failed. 
 
Keywords: diffusion barrier, ultra-thin film, Cu metallization, Cu3Si, Ru/MgO/Ta 
 electroplating bath contains CuSO4．5H2O (212.5 g/L) which is the Cu 2+ ion source. A dilute H2SO4 
solution was used to adjust the pH value of electroplating bath at 2. In the electroplating process the 
bath temperature and the current density were controlled at 25 ℃ and 5A/dm2, respectively. 
 After the structures of Cu (50nm)/Ru (2nm)/MgO (0.5~3nm)/Ta (2nm)/Si were prepared, they 
were annealed in a rapid thermal annealing (RTA) furnace. The annealing was carried out at a 
temperature from 300 to 800 ℃ for 5 and 30 minutes, respectively. The RTA furnace was kept at 
10-2 Torr pressure in the annealing process. 
 After the structures of Cu/Ru/MgO/Ta/Si were annealed, they were characterized by a 
four-point probe for their sheet resistances, by an X-ray diffractometer (Macscience Co. Ltd. 
MO3X-HF) for their crystal structures, by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-6360) 
for their surface morphologies, by a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010) for 
their cross-sectional microstructures and high resolution images. 
 slightly larger than the structure annealed at 700℃. The reason for the inconsistent phenomena may 
be ascribed that the amount of the Cu3Si phase is too small to be detected by the X-ray diffraction 
method. 
 
(c) Cu(50nm)/Ru(2nm)/MgO(1nm)/Ta(2nm)/Si 
The relation between sheet resistance and annealing temperatures for the structures of 
Cu(50)/Ru(2)/MgO(1)/Ta(2)/Si annealed for 5 minutes is shown in Fig.11, in which the sheet 
resistances are about 0.25 Ω/□ for the structures annealed at a temperature lower than 600℃, about 
35 Ω/□ for 700 ℃, about 200 Ω/□ for 750 ℃, and increases abruptly up to 9000 Ω/□ for 800℃. The 
X-ray diffraction patterns for the structures of Cu(50)/Ru(2)/MgO(1)/Ta(2)/Si annealed for 5 
minutes at a temperature from room temperature to 800℃ are shown in Fig.12, in which the Cu3Si 
phase peaks appear at the patterns for the annealing temperature of 700, 750, and 800 ℃. 
The SEM views for the surface morphologies of the structures of 
Cu(50)/Ru(2)/MgO(1)/Ta(2)/Si annealed for 5 minutes at 700 ℃, 750, and 800 ℃ are shown in 
Fig.13(a), (b), and(c), respectively. The number of Cu3Si particles emerged on the surface increases 
with the increase of annealing temperature from 700 ℃ to 800 ℃. It is obvious that there is a 
consistence among the sheet resistance, Cu3Si phase, and surface morphology for the structures 
annealed for 5 minutes at a temperature from room temperature to 800 ℃. 
 
(d) Cu(50 nm)/Ru(2nm)/MgO(0.5nm)/Ta(2μm)/Si 
 Fig 14 shows the relation between sheet resistances and annealing temperatures for the 
structures of Cu(50)/Ru(2)/MgO(0.5)/Ta(2)/Si annealed for 5 minutes. When the annealing 
temperature is equal to and lower than 550 ℃, the sheet resistances are about 0.25 Ω/□, and when 
the annealing temperature is 600℃, the sheet resistance increases to about 150 Ω/□. Fig 15 shows 
the X-ray diffraction patterns for the structures of Cu(50)/Ru(2)/MgO(0.5)/Ta(2)/Si annealed for 5 
minutes at a temperature from room temperature to 650 ℃. It can be seen that the Cu3Si phase 
peaks emerge at the patterns of 600 ℃ and 650 ℃. 
 Fig. 16(a), (b), (c) show the SEM views for the surface morphologies of the structures of 
Cu(50) /Ru(2)/MgO(0.5)/Ta(2)/Si annealed for 5 minutes at a temperature of 500 ,550 ,and 600℃, 
respectively. The surface is quite smooth in Fig 16(a) annealed at 500℃, more or less rough in Fig 
16(b) annealed at 550℃, and has many Cu3Si particles in Fig 16(c) annealed at 600 ℃. It can be 
seen from Fig. 14~16 that there also has a consistence among the sheet resistance, Cu3Si phase, and 
surface morphology for the structures annealed for 5 minutes at a temperature from room 
temperature to 600 ℃. 
 
(e) Effects of MgO layer thicknesses and annealing times on the failure of the diffusion 
barriers. 
 Table 1 lists the maximum annealing temperatures at which the structures of 
Cu(50nm)/Ru(2nm)/MgO(0.5~3nm) / Ta(2nm) /Si are annealed for 5 and 30 minutes and still have 
low sheet resistance. It can be seen that the maximum annealing temperature for 5 minutes is 550, 
600, 750, and 750 ℃, and for 30 minutes is 500, 600, 650, and 700 ℃ for the structure with a MgO 
layer of 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 nm, respectively. The longer the annealing time is, the lower the maximum
