In this paper, the cost function in [10] is modified 
to optimally synthesize the coupling matrix of high 
selectivity and group delay self-equalized canonical 
and CQ filters. The transfer function in [9] is used to 
calculate the frequency points needed in 
construction the cost function. By placing the 
appropriated numbers and positions of complex 
plane transmission zeros in the transfer function, a 
wide variety of filter with different group delay 
equalizations and selectivity can be synthesized. 
Many useful design curves can be obtained from the 
synthesis results. 
 
 
II. THE SYNTHESIS METHOD 
 
A. The Equivalent Circuit Network Responses 
 
For an N orders multi-coupled low pass prototype 
filter network, the normalized [ ]Z  matrix of that 
network can be expressed as  
 [ ] [ ] [ ] NNNN
u
NNNN mjUQ
pqZ ×××× −++= ])[1(    (1) 
 
,where all the elements of [ ]q matrix are zero except 
11q  and NNq . These two nonzero quantities are the 
inverse of the normalized external quality factor of 
the first and last low pass elements, respectively. 
Their values can be found from the synthesis 
program. The variable Ω= jp , and Ω  is the low 
pass angular frequency. The cutoff frequency of this 
low pass filter is rad/s 1=Ω c . uQ  is the unloaded 
quality factor of the low pass elements. In this paper, 
the filter to be synthesized is assumed lossless, and 
uQ  is set to infinity for each low pass element. The 
matrix [ ]U  is a unitary matrix and [ ]m is the 
normalized coupling matrix to be synthesized. For 
the synchronously tuned canonical and CQ filters to 
be studied in this paper, the diagonal elements of [ ]m  matrix will be zero. 
 
If the [ ]Z  matrix elements of the low pass 
prototype filter can be known from the synthesis 
method, the scattering parameters and group delay 
of the filter can be calculated as follows [1,10]

response of band pass filter is not a symmetrical 
distribution about 0f even if )(Ωdτ is an even 
function with respect to 0=Ω . On the other hand, 
the transformation from low pass to band pass can 
be easily and directly performed from (5) and (6). 
Therefore, it is only necessary to study the 
normalized response of low pass filter in this paper. 
 
 
B. The Transfer Function Having Finite 
Transmission Zero and Equalized Group Delay 
 
The transfer function having finite transmission 
zero and equalized group delay characteristic is 
needed before the optimally searching for the 
normalized equivalent circuit parameters. In order 
to have the above characteristics, at least two pairs 
of complex plane transmission zeros are needed to 
to maintain during this deformation, two pairs of 
non-axis complex zeros are needed (Those 
are ananan js Ω+±= σ and ananan js Ω−±= σ ). The 
canonical (N=6) and CQ (N=8) filters studied in this 
paper have two cross couplings in their coupling 
topologies. If the two cross couplings are used to 
achieve the two pairs of non-axis complex zeros, the 
selectivity of these two filters will greatly 
deteriorate. Therefore, the complex zeros for group 
delay equalization are limited to locate on the real 
axis ( aiais σ±= ， 0=Ω ai ) in this paper. 
 
 
C. The Cost Function 
 
By using the equation listed in Subsection A and 
B, a computer code is written to optimally find the 
filter network parameters according to the 
appropriately set transfer function. The cost 
function FCN for optimization is modified from

The variable Φ  represents the network parameters 
to be optimized. The superscript CR stands for the 
corresponding equivalent circuit responses. The 
symbols fw , vw , pw and gdw are the corresponding 
weightings. As mentioned in [9], the pass band 
reflection zero ( rzΩ ) and maximum ( rmΩ ) 
frequencies can be calculated from the roots of 
NU and NV , respectively. The symbol RL is the pass 
band minimum return loss of the synthesized filter. 
The group delay response dτ is calculated from the 
method described in Subsection A and B. 
 
 
III. THE SYNTHESIS RESULTS 
 
From the discussion of Fig. 1, it is found that the 
pass band group delay can be deformed to some 
extent by appropriated placing the complex plane 
zero. Therefore, it is necessary to define a parameter 
to characterize the equalization extent of group 
delay. In this paper the group delay percentage 
ripple (pgdrip) for the maximum (Gdmax) and 
minimum (Gdmin) group delays is defined as  
 
%100
minmax
minmax ×+
−=
GdGd
GdGdpgdrip .              (15) 
 
The first filter to be synthesized is a canonical 
filter (N=6) with the following parameters: 1) pass 
band minimum return loss 20dB ( 0.0435=ε ), 2) a 
pair of imaginary axis transmission zeros j1.2± , 3) 
pgdrip=1%. The canonical filter has two cross 
couplings. One of the cross coupling can be 
designed to achieve the high selectivity requirement 
by producing finite transmission zero. The other 
cross coupling can equalize the group delay 
response. Fig. 2 (a) and (b) respectively plot the 
amplitude responses of S-parameters and group 
delay of the filter after synthesized. The 
corresponding responses of Chebyshev and 
quasi-elliptical filters are also compared in these 
figures.  
 
The equalized filter has best group delay 
performance and medium selectivity. The 
quasi-elliptical filter has the highest selectivity, but 
the worst pass band group delay flatness. It takes 
367 times for the computer to optimally calculate 
the cost function. The final cost function value is 
7.7E-11. The equivalent circuit responses are nearly 
the same as those of transfer function. The network 
parameters after optimization are

The network parameters of filter with different 
group delay ripples can also be synthesized by 
placing the pair of real axis zeros in the suitable 
places. Fig. 3 (a) and (b) respectively plot the 
amplitude responses of S-parameters and 
delay equalization bandwidth will increase as 
pgdrip increase from 1% to 5%. The stop band 
selectivity will slightly deteriorate, as shown in Fig. 
5 (a), as pgdrip increase. Therefore, by properly 
using these design curves, a high selectivity and 
acceptable group delay equalization responses can 
be designed over the desired bandwidth. 
 
Fig. 6 summarizes the variations of the canonical 
(N=6) and CQ (N=8) filters' group delay 
equalization percentage bandwidth over the group 
delay percentage ripple (pgdrip) for different pairs 
of imaginary axis transmission zeros ( 2.1j± , 4.1j±  
and 6.1j± , respectively). As expected, the group 
delay equalization bandwidth will increase as 
pgdrip increase. The pair of transmission zeros take
