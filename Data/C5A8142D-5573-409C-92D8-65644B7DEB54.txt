columns of an incidence matrix [3] for this 
network are arranged based on the branch-cost. 
Then the fundamental cut-set [3], [4] can be 
identified through echelon-form processing [2], 
[4], [5] of this matrix. Accordingly, a tree with 
possibly minimal cost (MST) can be found. 
B. MFP 
  In this work the maximum-flow is obtained 
from the minimum-cut of the network. This is 
known as min-cut max-flow property [3] and 
consequently, MFP can be solved via MCP. 
This is addressed as Min-Cut/ Max-Flow 
Problem in this research project. 
C. MCP 
It is a recognized fact that maximum-flow 
implies minimum-cut of a transport network, 
and MCP is solved via MFP conventionally. 
  As contrast to the usual practice, the 
numerical method achieving minimum-cut is 
disclosed in this project, and MFP is to be 
solved via MCP instead. 
D. SPP 
  For a planar graph, with a nonnegative 
distance associated with each branch, in order 
to find the shortest-path (min-distance from the 
source to sink) we can find the Min-cut for its 
dual graph (the Min-cut capacity for its dual 
network) [3]. Therefore, the solution of SPP 
can be obtained via the numerical method of 
MCP as presented in this project. 
2. MSP Algorithm 
  Given a graph (network) of N nodes and B 
branches, each branch has a cost associated 
with it, the objective of MSP is to identify a 
minimum-spanning tree (MST) and then find 
the minimum cost of this spanning tree. The 
MSP algorithm is proposed as followings.

1.2 Pre-label Processing:  Rearrange the 
columns of M according to the 
ascending orders of the cost of each 
branch to get a flow table Q. 
step2.  (Echelon-form processing) 
2.1 Do Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF) 
eliminations on Q, delete the last zero 
row, and then get the echelon-form 
flow-table QE . 
2.2 There are N-1 rows in QE carrying N-1 
independent cut-set information for the 
graph. 
step3.  (MSP processing) 
3.1 Do reduced-Jordan elimination and 
rearrange columns of QE until the 
matrix falls in form of [ ]FI=T , 
here I is an identity matrix of order N-1. 
3.2 The branches related to the unity 
column vectors are the feasible tree 
branches, and they constitute the MST 
of the network.  
3.3 Each row of T carries the fundamental 
cut-set information for the graph. 
3. MCP Algorithm  
Given a graph (network) of N nodes and B 
branches, each branch (i,j) has a non-negative 
capacity α(i,j) associated with it, the objective 
of MCP is to identify a feasible cut C = ( )P,P  
which divides the nodes into two subsets P 
and P . The subset P contains the source a, and 
the sink z must be in P . One also seeks to find 
a feasible cut C such that the cut-value ( )P,Pα  is a minimum. 
The capacity of a cut, the cut value, denoted 
by ( )P,Pα , is defined to be the sum of the 
capacities of those branches incident from the 
nodes in P to the nodes in P , i.e.,
