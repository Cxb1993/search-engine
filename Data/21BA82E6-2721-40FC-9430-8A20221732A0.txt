We ﬁrst propose the existence of bound states in the continuums (BICs) in quasiperiodic systems.
Owing to long-range correlation, destructive interference may occur in quasiperiodic systems with higher
generation order. Occurrences of BICs in Fibonacci quantum wells studied by localization analysis and gap
map method are proposed.

The existence of bound states in the continuum (BIC), localized
states embedded in the continuum of positive energy, was ﬁrst
predicted by von Neumann and Wigner for a type of spatially oscil-
lating attractive potentials [1]. Friedrich and Wintgen have proven
that BIC may occur due to the interference of resonances associ-
ated with different channels [2]. Later, radial potentials support-
ing the BIC has been constructed and applied in nuclear, atomic,
molecular [3,4] and monatomic chains [5]. Moreover, several stud-
ies have addressed the existence of BIC in low-dimensional sys-
tems, which can be summarized brieﬂy by classiﬁcation of the
structures. First, BICs have been found in one-dimensional meso-
scopic systems, including one-dimensional quantum wire with
quantum dots [6,7], and uniform chain with quantum dots [8,9].
Second, these states may exist in open two-dimensional systems,
such as quantum dot with leads [10–13], and bended waveg-
uides [14]. Third, BIC occurs in periodic systems with defects,
which is applied in superlattice [15] and periodic stubs with de-
fects [16]. Since the discovery of quasicrystals in 1984 [17], novel
man-made and natural quasiperiodic materials have been reported
and received much attention [18–21]. The structure of quasiperi-
odic systems is long-range correlated, which is between periodic
and disordered. Many theoretical and experimental works have
shown that the physical properties of the system are different from
the periodic and disordered systems [22–25]. Localized states in
a quasiperiodic chain with defects or a ﬁnite quasiperiodic chain
without cyclic boundary conditions have been presented [26,27].

However, in this Letter, the existence of BICs in quasiperiodic sys-
tems is proposed for the ﬁrst time.
BICs in periodic systems with defects are the above barrier lo-
calized states, which happen in destructive interference from Bragg
reﬂectors. Energy ranges of these BICs can be determined by the
band structure of the periodic system. However, quasiperiodic sys-
tems are usually created by generation rules, by which the correla-
tion of structures is long-range but not periodical. Thus, the energy
spectra in quasiperiodic systems will split into multifractal bands
as the generation order (GO) increases [24]. In this study, we ﬁnd
that the destructive interference of wave functions due to long-
range correlation may occur in some ranges of the quasiperiodic
system with higher GO. Through the localization length analysis,
we ﬁnd that occurrences of BICs are dependent not only on par-
ticle energy but also on basis structure of the system. Existence
conditions of BICs in the quasiperiodic system are proposed using
the gap map diagram.
For a general point of view, we consider a particle in a one-
dimensional Fibonacci quantum well (FQW), which comprises of
two units A and B arranged by Fibonacci sequence. The vth gen-
eration of Fibonacci sequence is generated by recursive scheme
as Sν = {Sν−1Sν−2} for v > 2, with S0 = {B} and S1 = {A}. One-
dimensional Hamiltonian of a particle in the Sv FQW is given by

structure is to determine the bandedge, occurring in the condi-
tion of cosKL = ±1. According to Eq. (4), we have the bandedge
equations as Jb = 0 with b = 1 or −1, in which Jb is deﬁned by
Jb = 1− r+r− + t2 − 2tb. (5)
Using the bandedge equations, we can determine the bandedges
without calculating the dispersion function cosKL. Moreover, since
the centers of allowed bands occur in cosKL = 0, the band cen-
ter equation is given by J0 = 0. With the bandedge and the band
center equations, the band structure of the system can be deter-
mined without calculating the dispersion function cosKL to avoid
numerical instability.
Fig. 3 shows the energy spectra and localized region of the
FQWs with dA/dB = 1.5 for GOs 3–8. The energy spectra are de-
termined by the bandedge equations, J±1 = 0, to avoid numerical
instability especially for the system with higher GO. As can be
seen, the allowed bands are broken by some gaps as the GO of
the system becomes higher. Numbers of each forbidden and al-
lowed bands in the region increase exponentially for the system
with increasing GO. However, we ﬁnd that widths of some special
band gaps, called the major gaps, almost do not decrease if the GO
becomes higher. Widths of these major gaps converge to constant
values as the GO approaches inﬁnity. It is interesting that the ma-
jor gaps for higher GOs almost match the energy ranges G1, G2, . . .
of Fig. 1. Moreover, the centers of the major gaps in Fig. 3 almost
match the energy corresponding to the minimum values of the lo-
calized length in Fig. 1, indicating that BICs may exist in FQWs as
the energy located in the major gaps for the system with higher
GO.
The energy spectrum and wavefunctions in the FQWs depend
not only on the GO order but also on the basis. The gap map dia-
gram for the S5 FQW versus the ﬁlling factor F is shown in Fig. 4,

center of major holes for FQWs with GOs 3–8.
in which the ﬁlling factor is deﬁned by F = dA/D and the gray
areas represent the allowed bands. Each forbidden band in the
diagram may have some zero-gap points. These zero-gap points
are located on zero-gap lines Z A,m or ZB,n , which are governed
by kAdA = mπ or kBdB = nπ , respectively, for positive integers
m and n. The zero-gap points on lines ZB,n are determined by
kBdB = nπ and Nv−1kAdA = jπ for positive integers n and j, de-
noted by point C( j/Nv−1,n). In the same way, zero-gap points
C(m, j/Nv−2) are located on lines Z A,m for positive integers m
and j. Thus the energy and ﬁlling factor corresponding to zero-gap
points C(m,n) can be determined by
α2εF 2 =m2, α2(ε + 1)(1− F )2 = n2, (6)
where α = (8m0D2U0)1/2/h. Eq. (6) can be rewritten by the quar-
tic function of a single variable, ε1/2 or F . Thus, each of ε and F
can be solved analytically. Zero-gap points in the gap map diagram
for the FQWs with different GOs are not the same except C(m,n)
for integers m and n. The lines Z A,m and ZB,n with positive inte-
gers m and n have the same position for the system with arbitrary
GOs.
The band map of the FQW is divided by the zero-gap lines
Z A,m and ZB,n for positive integers m and n into several regions,
in which region (m,n) is deﬁned by the region bounded by the
zero-gap lines Z A,m , Z A,m+1, ZB,n , and ZB,n+1. The number of for-
bidden bands, zero-gap points and their patterns in each region
are the same. For the Sv FQW, there are Nv−1 forbidden bands
in each region. The number of forbidden gaps in each region in-
creases as the GO becomes higher. In the gap map, we ﬁnd that
two major holes (MHs) in each region have less change in gap
width for higher GO. The one with higher energy is denoted by
higher major hole (HMH) and the other is denoted by lower major
hole (LMH). In region (m,n), right and left ends of the HMH are lo-
cated on zero-gap points C(m+1,n) and C(m+Nv−3/Nv−1,n+1),
respectively; while the left and right ends of the LMH are lo-
cated on C(m,n + 1) and C(m + Nv−2/Nv−1,n), respectively. End
points of MHs C(m + 1,n) and C(m,n + 1) are ﬁxed points, which
keep the same position for arbitrary GOs. The other end points
C(m + Nv−3/Nv−1,n + 1) and C(m + Nv−2/Nv−1,n) are moving
points, which change position for different GOs. As the GO be-
comes very high, the moving ends of both HMH and LMH will
converge to positions C(m + τ−2,n + 1) and C(m + τ−1,n), re-
spectively, in which τ is the golden ratio and deﬁned by τ =
(1 + √5 )/2. The energy and ﬁlling factor corresponding to the
converged positions can be obtained by Eq. (6) but m and n in
the equation are respectively replaced by m + τ−2 and n + 1 for
C(m+ τ−2,n+ 1) and by m+ τ−1 and n for C(m+ τ−1,n). More-
over, center and edges of each MH will converge to ﬁxed positions
for higher GO. However, the gapwidths of all holes in the gap map
diagram will decrease except the MHs for higher GO. Fig. 5 shows
the NLL of particle with the energy at the center of MHs of the Sv
