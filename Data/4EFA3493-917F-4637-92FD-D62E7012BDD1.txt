1. Introduction 
Powdery TiO2 has wide industry 
applications such as paints, plastics, 
paper, coatings, cosmetics, ceramics, 
electronics, and photocatalysts.1  
Surface and crystal structure change of 
TiO2 with temperature, pressure, size 
miniature, and solid solution are thus of 
great interest. 
 
Pulsed laser ablation (PLA) 
condensation has been used for the 
synthesis of TiO2 rutile nanoparticles 
with defects due to their imperfectly 
oriented attachment over well-developed 
{110} and (011) planes.2  This dynamic 
process also created post-rutile TiO2 
nanoparticles, i.e. α-PbO2-type,3 and 
fluorite-type related structures,4 
regarding to the possible condensation 
settings of dense oxides around the 
presolar stars.  Laser ablation was also 
known to enhance solid solubility of 
NiO in post-rutile type TiO2,5,6 as well 
as MgO in ZnO wurtzite,7-9 which can 
be attributed to pressure effect as 
manifested by the experimental results 
under hydrostatic pressure.10 
 
Here we used PLA condensation 
technique to fabricate Cr- or 
Co-dissolved TiO2 nanoparticles with 
various dense crystal structures.  We 
focused on the ordering/clustering of 
charge and volume compensating 
defects to form crystallographic shear 
(CS) superstructures along specific 
lattice planes as a comparison with the 
ordered CS structures in the 
composition range (Ti,Cr)Ox, 1.875 < x 
< 1.93 having the CS plane rotates 
continuously from (121) to (132) about 
the [111] zone axis of the rutile 
structure.11,12  The mechanisms of solid 
solubility change of metal oxides via 
 4
of Cr was successfully dissolved in the 
TiO2 condensates assembled in a close 
packed manner. 
 
3.2. TEM 
TEM BFI coupled with SAED 
pattern and EDX analysis of the 
nanocondensates deposited for a rather 
short time (ca. 1 second) on 
carbon-coated collodion film showed 
that the Cr-dissolved (ca. 2.4 at. % Cr) 
TiO2 condensates are mainly rutile, 
anatase and α-PbO2-type for the case of 
using ceramic target (Fig. 2-1); whereas 
rutile, anatase, brookite, α-PbO2-type 
and baddeleyite-type for the case of 
Cr-Ti target (Fig. 2-2).  In both cases, 
the nanocondensates were in random 
orientation and assembled as nano chain 
aggregate (NCA). 
 
Lattice image and 2-D forward and 
inverse Fourier transform of the 
individual nanocondensates further 
indicated that the Cr-dissolved rutile 
nanocondensate has 1/2 ( 2 11) and 1/2 
(0 1 1) superlattices, extensive (0 1 1) 
faulting as well as stepwise (011) and 
( 2 11) facets (Fig. 3).  These CS 
schemes are consistent with the 
conventional ones rotating about the 
[111] zone axis as reported for ambient 
samples.11,12  There are, however, 
additional (100) and (010) superlattice 
reflections and stepwise {110} facets as 
shown edge on in [001] zone axis (Fig. 
4).  It is an open question whether the 
new CS scheme is independent of the 
reported one as a result of the present 
dynamic PLA process.  Butterfly twin 
(Fig. 5) and polysynthetic twinning and 
faulting (Fig. 6) by the (101) plane were 
also commonly observed for the 
Cr-dissolved rutile. 
 
The anatase nanocondensate 
dissolved with Cr as high as ca. 16 wt% 
(8.3 at.%) to have a rather corrugated 
surface showed (002) superlattice and 
dislocations with half plane parallel to 
(10 1 ) (Fig. 7).  By contrast, the 
Cr-dissolved brookite nanocondensate 
showed (001) and (110) superlattice and 
(110) facet as viewed edge on in [110] 
zone axis (Fig. 8). 
 
The Cr-dissolved (ca. 1 at.% Cr) 
α-PbO2-type TiO2 nanocondensate 
typically showed 1/2(002}, 1/2(1 3 1) 
and 1/2(1 3 1 ) superstructures and 
{131}and (001) surfaces (Fig. 9).  The 
(010) and (100) superlattices, (010) and 
{110} facets as well as dislocations with  
half plane parallel to (110) were also 
observed in another such type 
nanoparticle (Fig. 10). 
 
The Cr-dissolved baddeleyite-type 
TiO2 nanocondensate was only 
occasionally observed (Fig. 11).  This 
type of nanoparticle showed (021) and 
(110) facets and dislocation with (111) 
half plane.

spectrum of the Cr-dissolved TiO2

on ceramic target for 20 min and (b) on 
Cr-Ti target for 2 min.  The absorbance 
corresponds to a minimum band gap of 
3.1, and 2.8 eV, based on its intersection 
with the base line at 407 nm (case a) and 
448 nm (case b), respectively.  The 
additional intersection at 381 nm in (b) 
gives a minimum band gap of 3.3 eV 
which is possibly due to varied extent of 
Cr dissolution in the sample.
