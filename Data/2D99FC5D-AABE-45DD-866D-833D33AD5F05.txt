ABSTRACT 
P-type transparent CuAl1-xCaxO2 thin films were prepared by rf-sputtering at room 
temperature without any additional post-annealing processes. The replacement of 20 % of the Al 
with Ca in the Cu-Al-O thin films improved the electrical conductivity of the films by two to 
three orders of magnitude, yet further increasing the quantity of Al beyond 20 % had a 
detrimental effect on conductivity. The activation energy for electrical conductivity was reduced 
as conductivity increased. The CuAl1-xCaxO2 was then used as p-type material for the transparent 
heterojunction pn diode. Transparent p-n heterojunction diodes composed of ZnO:Al, ZnO, and 
CuAlOx:Ca thin films were fabricated on indium tin oxide (ITO) coated polyethylene 
terephthalate (PET). Diodes with three different heterojuction structures, ZnO:Al/CuAlOx:Ca, 
ZnO:Al/i-ZnO/CuAlOx:Ca, and ZnO:Al/n-ZnO/CuAlOx:Ca, were demonstrated with best 
achieved rectify ratios (at ±4V) of 946, 237, and 555, respectively. The transmittances of the 
devices were within ~45% to ~70% from wavelengths ranged from 400 nm to 700 nm. UV 
responses for these diodes were also were tested under the irradiation of 365 nm UV light. The 
best achieved UV responsivities were 4.03×10-1, 7.36×10-2, and 2.32×10-1 A/W at -6 V for 
ZnO:Al/CuAlOx:Ca, ZnO:Al/i-ZnO/CuAlOx:Ca, and ZnO:Al/n-ZnO/CuAlOx:Ca diodes, 
respectively. 
INTORDUCTION 
P-type CuAlO2 semiconducting oxides were first reported in 1984 [1]. In 1997, Kawazoe 
used pulse laser deposition (PLD) to make CuAlO2 thin films on a substrate at a temperature of 
700 oC [2]. Since that time, this research topic has attracted a great deal of attention due to the 
need for p-type oxide materials to realize versatile oxide electronic devices [3–15]. For electronic 
components, one fundamental device is p-n junction diode. Due to the lack of stable p-type 
ZnO-based materials, delafossite p-type oxides have been used in conjunction with ZnO to make 
transparent heterojunction pn diodes [16–23], such as p-CuAlO2/n-AlZnO [16], p-CuAlO2/n-ZnO 
[17–19], p-CuCrO2:Mg/n-ZnO [20], p-SrCu2O2/n-ZnO [21], p-CuYO2/n-ZnO [22], and 
p-AgCoO2/n-ZnO [23]. Yet the reported results of the p-n diodes involve high temperature 
process on rigid glass substrates. There are still few researches regarding transparent oxide p-n 
junction diodes on clear plastic substrates. In this paper, we report the performance of rf-sputtered 
flexible transparent ZnO:Al/ZnO/CuAlO2:Ca heterojunction diodes on clear polyethylene 
terephthalate (PET) substrates. Devices were made at room temperature without further thermal 
treatment. Various structures of ZnO:Al/ZnO/CuAlO2:Ca heterojunction diodes were studied. The 
transmittance, averaged between 400 nm to 700 nm, was ranged from ~45% to ~70%. There is a 
trade-off between optimal transparency, breakdown voltage, and rectify ratio. The UV 
responsivity of each device was also evaluated. 
 
EXPERIMENTS 
150 nm-thick CuAlO2 and CuAl1-xCaxO2 thin films were rf-sputtered on a 1 mm thick glass 
substrate (Schott B270) without intentional heating. The targets were sintered from a mixture of

Figure 1 (a) Optical bandgap and (b) resistivity of CuAl1-xCaxO2 thin films as a function of 
sputtering atmosphere O2/Ar ratio. The resistivity of CuAlO2 thin film deposited with O2/Ar ratio 
= 0 was not shown here due to the limitation of measurement equipment. 
Compared to the CuAlO2 films, the addition of 10 at.% Ca reduced the resistivity of films by 
two orders of magnitude; and the addition of 20 at.% Ca in the target lowered the resistivity by 
three orders of magnitude, reaching a value of ~70 Ω·cm. Similar to the optical bandgap Eg, the 
trend reversed as the substitution of Ca increased from 20% to 30%, and the resistivity of films 
deposited from CuAl0.7Ca0.3O2 was close to that of films from CuAl0.9Ca0.1O2.  
[Cu]/[Al] ratio and process temperature are critical parameters [7–9] in the transparency of 
CuAlO2 films. In our study, the transmittance T (%) averaged over 400 nm to 700 nm was 
positively correlated with the resistivity of the films, as plotted in Fig. 2. This indicates that a 
compromise between the conductivity and the optical transparency of the films must be made for 
the design of electronic devices when calcium is used as the dopants in CuAlO2 thin film. The 
improvement in electrical conductivity was also confirmed by the thermal activation energy, Ea. 
Fig. 3 shows the activation energy of CuAl1-xCaxO2 film with x adjusted between 0 and 0.2. The 
activation energy was reduced when Al was substituted by Ca, and in general the amount of 
reduction was positively correlated to the amount of substitution. At temperature below 200 K, 
conductivities followed a T-1/4 rule, which suggested the presence of gap states close to the Fermi

In the n+-AZO/i-ZnO/p-CuAlOx:Ca heterojunction structure, the insertion of intrinsic layer 
enlarged the depletion region, reduced the probabilities of the electron tunneling under reverse 
bias, and also avoid the Zener effect. Devices with lower leakage current and higher breakdown 
voltage are obtained. The properties for the diodes are listed in Table 2. The average optical 
transmittances (400 nm to 700 nm) are around 58% for devices with all three i-ZnO thicknesses. 
The breakdown voltage increased as the thickness of intrinsic ZnO layer increased. The 10 nm 
i-ZnO layer device exhibited best rectify ratio (~237) among the devices with three different 
intrinsic layer thicknesses.

 In the n+-AZO/n-ZnO/p-CuAlOx:Ca heterojunction structure, an ZnO (n-layer) thin film of 
40 nm in thickness was deposited on p-CuAlOx:Ca layer coated on ITO-PET substrate. The 
thickness of p-CuAlOx:Ca layer was varied as 100, 200 and 300nm. The insertion of n-layer were

exhibited best rectify ratio of 555. The breakdown voltage increased as the thickness of p-layer 
increased. The dark current was also improved as the p-layer thickness increased. The 
characteristic parameters of the heterojunction diodes with different p-layer thickness were list in 
Table 3. The average transmittance (400 nm to 700 nm) of the whole diode also decreased as the 
p-layer thickness increased.

SUMMARY 
P-type transparent CuAl1-xCaxO2 thin films were prepared by rf-sputtering at room 
temperature. By substituting 20 at.% Al with Ca in the CuAlO2 thin films, the RT electrical 
conductivity was improved by three orders of magnitude. Diodes with three different 
heterojuction structures, ZnO:Al/CuAlOx:Ca, ZnO:Al/i-ZnO/CuAlOx:Ca, and 
ZnO:Al/n-ZnO/CuAlOx:Ca were fabricated on ITO-coated PET substrates. The corresponding 
best achieved rectify ratios (at ±4V) are 946, 237, and 555, respectively. The transmittances of 
the devices were within ~45% to ~70% from wavelengths ranged from 400 nm to 700 nm, 
depending on the thicknesses of layers used in the diodes. The bset achieved UV responsivities 
for these diodes were 4.03×10-1, 7.36×10-2, and 2.32×10-1 A/W at -6 V under the irradiation of 
365 nm UV light, for ZnO:Al/CuAlOx:Ca, ZnO:Al/i-ZnO/CuAlOx:Ca, and 
ZnO:Al/n-ZnO/CuAlOx:Ca diodes, respectively.

addressed electrically, by a simple single photolithographic step, to yield a large number of 
nanoelectrical devices with an unprecedented high-fidelity rate. The resulting knocked-down

一、參加會議經過 
The 2011 Spring Meeting of Material Research Society (2011 Spring MRS) was held in 
San Francisco USA from Apr 25th to May 1st, which included five days of research seminars 
and exhibitions. There were fifty-one parallel technical sessions and several events held in the 
conference. During the conference, our research group presented one technical paper (oral 
presentation) in the symposium of “Amorphous and Polycrystalline Thin-Film Silicon Science 
and Technology” A22.3, titled: “DC and AC gate-bias stability of nanocrystalline silicon thin 
film transistors made on colorless polyimide foil.”  
 
The technical sessions covered five major fields: materials for energy and sustainability, 
electronic and photonic materials, nanomaterials and nanotechnology, organic and 
biomaterials, and general material science. Topics related to energy harvest and storage were 
apparently the major focus in the meeting. They were covered in the field of “materials for 
energy and sustainability” as well as in “nanomaterials and nanotechnology” and “organic 
materials.” In addition, one symposium was dedicated to “nuclear radiation detection 
materials,” which had gained much attention. The attendees included many experts as well as 
prospect young researchers from academia, government laboratories, and industry from all 
over the world. 
 
二、與會心得 
During the five day conference period, many novel technologies and new applications of 
materials and devices had been presented. I spent most of my time in the sessions related to
materials for energy and sustainability, including: amorphous and polycrystalline thin-film 
silicon science and technology, third-generation and emerging solar-cell technology, advanced 
materials processing for scalable solar-cell manufacturing, energy harvesting, and complex 
oxide materials for emerging energy technologies. Among various technical presentations, the 
following topics were most interesting to me. 
 
First is the “emerging strategies for next generation photovoltaics.” To increase the 
photo-electrical conversion efficiency of photovoltaic devices, nanosturcutres, such as 
nanocrystal quantum dots and quantum wires, the concept of hot carriers and multiple exciton 
generation have been incorporated into the design and implementation of solar cells. In 
particular, Prof. Martin Green of University of New South Wales presented recent progress on 
hot carrier solar cells. By interfering phonon relaxation process to slow down the carrier 
cooling, the conversion efficiency was moving toward the theoretical thermal dynamic limit 
of 74%. Another interesting presentation was using cold welding method to transfer
high-performance III-V solar cells from wafer to Au-coated polyimide substrates, which 
allowed the substrates to be reusable. This technique opens a door to realize low-cost 
large-area III-V solar cells.
