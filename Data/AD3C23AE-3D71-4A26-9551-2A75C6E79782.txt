contain an infinite series term and is much easier to compute.  Chan et al. [2] only considered 
the case of a zero-drawdown boundary, i.e., assuming the surface topography along the boundary 
is flat.  Kuo et al. [3] utilized the image-well method to predict the drawdown distribution in 
aquifers with irregularly shaped boundaries; however, their solutions may diverge if insufficient 
number and improper locations of the image wells are employed. 
Consider a non-leaky aquifer whose plan view is a sector of a circle.  The groundwater flow 
in a wedge-shaped aquifer is analyzed in the polar coordinate system.  Physically, a groundwater 
flow system with a wedge-shaped aquifer is commonly formed by ancient alluvial fan.  The 
hydraulic head distribution within the sector naturally depends on the wedge angle and boundary 
conditions.  The constant-head and no-flow boundary conditions are often used to represent the 
real-world hydrogeological boundary conditions.  An annual average water level for a stream 
may be used as the boundary of time-independent head for a regional groundwater flow system if 
the bottom of the stream is connected with the aquifer.  For a valley flank with a gentle sloping 
and rolling topography, an equation in terms of the trigonometric functions of radial distance 
along the boundary may be suitable to describe the water level configuration [6].  The purpose 
of this paper is to develop a general mathematical model with a variety of topographic and 
hydrogeological boundary conditions to describe the groundwater flow system in a wedge-shaped 
aquifer.  In addition, the transient-state and steady-state solutions are derived based on the 
mathematical model and simplified to concise forms for easy computing.  Several case studies 
are demonstrated in this paper and those cases may be considered as the applications of the 
solutions.   
These new solutions are useful and valuable to analyze the groundwater flow in the 
wedge-shaped aquifer.  These solutions can be used: (1) to describe the groundwater flow in a 
wedge-shaped aquifer under a variety of topographic and hydrogeological boundary conditions, 
(2) to predict drawdown for any wedge angle of the aquifer that the traditional method of image 
is not applicable, (3) to evaluate the sensitivity of the parameters in the mathematical model, and 
(4) to identify the hydraulic parameters when coupling with an optimization approach in aquifer 
data analysis.

Jµ  is the Bessel function of the first kind

represent the hydraulic head arisen from the slopes, curves, and elevations of the boundaries of 
the wedge-shaped aquifer respectively. 
Notice that the presence of the Bessel functions of high order and large argument in (5) and (6)

Results and Discussion  
Several cases are considered in this paper.  Table 1 lists the wedge angle and the 
topographical parameters for cases (a) - (c) as the ancient alluvial fans with various boundaries.  
Assume that there is a single pumping well located at 10000 =r m and o300 =θ  in these 
alluvial fans with a pumping rate 30,000 m3/day for two days.  These cases can be regarded as 
the applications of the analytical solutions.  The configurations of the hydraulic head 
distribution for cases (a) - (c) are also shown in Figs. 4(a) – 7(c) respectively.  Different angles 
of the wedge-shaped aquifer and topographic parameters of the rechargeable boundaries cause 
significantly different configurations of the hydraulic head distribution within the wedge-shaped 
aquifer.
