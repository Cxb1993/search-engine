1Abstract
The coarse-grained Configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulation was used to investigate
structural behaviors of MMA-oligomers adsorbed on grooved substrates with different aspect
ratios. In this study, three types of chains are classified according to their positions relative to the
groove. Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 represent the entire MMA-oligomer within the groove, the
MMA-oligomer partially within the groove, and the oligomer outside the groove, respectively.
The orientational order parameters of Type 1 and Type 2 oligomers decrease with the increase of
groove width, but the orientational order parameter of Type 3 oligomers is approximately equal
to 0.1, displaying an arrangement similar to bulk material. In addition, observation of the
orientational order parameters of Type 1 oligomers interacting with the grooved substrate at
different interaction strengths decrease with increasing the groove width. The orientational order
parameters of Type 1 oligomers within the narrowest (20 Å) and the widest (35 Å) groove with
different depths were determined in order to understand the effect of groove depth on the
arrangement of Type 1 oligomers. For the narrowest groove, the arrangement of Type 1
oligomers will be influenced by the groove width. However, in the case of the widest groove, the
orientational order parameter of Type 1 oligomers is approximately equal to 0.2, which indicates
the Type 1 oligomers aggregate with others in a conformation similar to the bulk material. Finally,
while the number of Type 1 oligomers does not have significant variance when the grooved depth
is equal to 20 Å, the number of Type 1 oligomers decreases with increasing interaction strength
when the groove is deeper than 20 Å.

3of an anisotropic substrate surface structure, the shape of droplet will be distorted, and the contact
angle is no longer uniform along the contact line. From their experimental results, the degree of
wetting anisotropy and the contact angle hysteresis perpendicular to the grooves increases with an
increase in groove depth. Ball et al. [16] studied relative influences of different surface features
and roughness of hydroxyapatite coated titanium alloy on metabolic activity of osteoblast-like
cells and differentiation. The results reveal that the topography of the surface influences the cell
responses to the surface, with cells either spread or elongated when on the ordered surface.
However, on rough surfaces, the cells are constrained. Hori et al. [17] focused on improving the
sensitivity of fluorescence detection by varying groove depth and surface profile. The results
demonstrate that the groove depth and the shape of the grafting surface profile are important
factors in improving the sensitivity of detection by fluorescence microscopy. Fujuta et al. [18]
researched the dynamic characteristics of cell alignment along the nanogrooved pattern by
time-lapse microscopy. The results show that the cell protrusions perpendicular to the
nanogrooved pattern retract more quickly than those parallel to the nanogrooved pattern. The
anisotropic retraction rate of cell protrusion induces cell elongation and alignment along the
nanogrooved pattern. Yi et al. [19] investigated the orientation of liquid crystals adsorbed on the
checkerboard patterns of square wells which had been fabricated by nanoimprinting. Their results
demonstrate that the orientation of liquid crystals on the substrate depends on the aspect ratio of
the wells. The liquid crystal prefers planar orientation on the smooth surfaces; comparatively, the
direction of liquid crystal transitions from planar to homeotropic when the surfaces are
topographically patterned. Although the steady-state of molecules on the substrate can be
observed by experiment, there are some drawbacks in the experimental process. For example, the
polymeric adsorption mechanism on the substrate is difficult to observe due to the limitations of
the experimental equipment at such small scale, so numerical methods must be used to retrieve
the information beyond experimental limitations.
Among these numerical methods, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a powerful tool
facilitating the investigation of the adsorption mechanism at the atomic level. Utilizing this
technique, Kim and Darve [20] studied electro-osmotic flows inside charged nanochannels with
rough surfaces by MD simulation. Since the channel height is effectively reduced by surface
roughness, the effective channel height is due to the decreased mobility of water molecules and
sodium ions inside the groove. In addition, the flow rate decreases with decreasing surface
roughness or increasing amplitude of surface roughness. Kiyohara et al. [21] investigated the
mechanism of surface anchoring of rodlike molecules on a corrugated substrate by MD
simulation. Their results show that since the rodlike molecules are influenced by the anisotropic
interaction between the molecules and the corrugated surface, the rodlike molecules are aligned
along the grooved direction. The anchored strength increases with decreasing period of
corrugation. Wang et al. [22] researched the adsorption of polyethylene (PE) of different chain
lengths on pattern graphite surface by employing MD simulation. The results show that the PE
adsorption on the substrate can be controlled by tuning surface nanostructure. The adsorption
energy, the order parameter, and the surface-chain contacting pair number decrease at fixed chain
5(DPD) [30]. The immiscibility property of PE and PLLA polymers induces phase separation and
exhibits different architectures at different volume fraction. The radius of gyration was shown
such that the structural arrangement of a polymer chain was dependent on the phase structure and
had a significantly different structural arrangement for the very short chains in the homopolymer
and copolymer. In addition, as the chain length increases, the chain exhibits more stretching
behavior in lamellae, perforated lamellae, and cylindrical configurations, whereas the chain
exhibits a smaller degree of stretching or extension in the cluster configuration.
Among various polymer thin films, the poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) thin film is
widely used in engineering because it exhibits a glassy state at room temperature. We therefore
have performed MD simulation of the MMA-oligomer thin film with different chain lengths on
an Au (111) substrate [31]. Our results reveal that the MMA-oligomers exhibit a flattened
conformation parallel to the Au substrate in the contact region and a slightly flattened
conformation in the surface region for both short- and long-chain thin film. Moreover, the
tacticity of MMA-oligomer thin films does not have evident effects on their conformations for
either short- or long-chain cases. According to our previous experience, we chose
MMA-oligomer as the subject in the present study and investigated the conformational behaviors
of MMA-oligomers adsorbed on the grooved substrate with different aspect ratios by
Configurational-bias Monte Carlo (CBMC) simulation.
Simulation model
In the present study, the coarse-grained model and Configurational-bias Monte Carlo
simulation are employed. The following is the brief description of the present simulation method.
Derivation of CG potentials
The structural-based coarse-grained model and the Configurational-bias Monte Carlo
simulation were employed in the present research. The structural-based model of an
MMA-oligomer is shown in Figure 1. In this study, an MMA-oligomer consists of five
monomers, and a coarse-grained bead represents a chemical repeat unit. A bead placed at the
mass center of a monomer is used as the interactive site for the calculation of nonbonded
interaction energy between two non-successive beads in the same oligomer and between beads on
different chains. The bonded intramolecular interaction between two successive CG beads is
determined by probability distributions of the lengths and angles between beads, shown in Figure
2. These probability distributions are obtained from the fully atomistic MD simulation of the
MMA-oligomer with the aid of the ENCAD force field [32], and then applied to the CBMC
simulation.
Calculation of the nonbonded interaction energy is important for coarse-grained modeling.
In the present study, a continuous spherically symmetric effective potential energy, Ueff, was
employed to calculate the nonbonded interaction energy, which can be written as [33]

7adsorption of long chain molecules [36]. Also, this technique guarantees that polymeric chains
are grown toward energetically favorable configurations, and ensures that they do not overlap
with others. In this study, the CBMC simulation was applied to the structural-based model
described above to obtain the equilibrium conformation of MMA-oligomers adsorbed on the
grooved substrate. The coarse-grained oligomers were then moved via the CBMC algorithm [35]
until conformations corresponding to an energetically favorable state had been obtained.
The main purpose of this study is investigating the structural properties of MMA-oligomers
adsorbed on the grooved substrate. In order to increase the efficiency of the simulation, the
definition of the interaction strength between substrate and beads is based on the interaction
between polymeric beads, initially set at 20 times polymeric beads interaction strength. Figure 4
presents a simulation model of MMA-oligomers adsorbed on the substrate with groove width of
20 Å. The adsorbing surface was assumed to be parallel to the X-Y plane of the size 100 Å*100
Å, and the periodic boundary condition was imposed in x and y directions. The simulation system
involves 300 MMA-oligomers, with each oligomer consisting of five monomers. In order to
obtain a stable equilibrium conformation of the molecular system, a simulated annealing
approach was applied to the CBMC simulation. During the simulation, the system was annealed
from the initial temperature (T=1000 K) to the target temperature (T = 300 K) with a decreasing
rate of 100 K per 103 CBMC steps. In order to ensure that the system achieved an equilibrium
state, when the system reached the target temperature, a total number of 9*106 CBMC steps were
continued, with a longer simulation still displaying the same results. One step in the CBMC
simulation denotes one trial move on all the beads of the system. Conformations from the last 106
steps were averaged to examine the structural behavior of the molecular system.
Results and discussion
In this study, the conformation behaviors of MMA-oligomers adsorbed on grooved
substrates were carried out by CBMC simulation, and all statistical data in Figs. 6-10 were
sampled for 5*104 steps following a simulation process of a duration of 9*106 CBMC steps.
Different initial arrangements of MMA-oligomers were considered, but the final MMA-oligomer
distributions on the grooved substrates are very similar, indicating the equilibrium arrangement of
MMA-oligomers can be obtained by the CBMC simulation. Figs. 5(a)-5(e) show the equilibrium
conformations of MMA-oligomers adsorbed on grooved substrates with five different groove
widths: 15 Å, 20 Å, 25 Å, 30 Å, and 35 Å at the same depth of 20 Å. The interaction strength
between substrate and MMA-oligomers (noted hereafter as the substrate/MMA-oligomer
interaction strength) is 20 times of the interaction between MMA-oligomers. For the grooves
narrower than 30 Å, the MMA-oligomers forming the layer structure and the number of layers
gradually increase with the increase of the groove width. This suggests that MMA-oligomers
within the narrower grooves are confined by the groove width such that MMA-oligomers can
only aggregate in the layer arrangement to get more stable configurations within the narrower
grooves. In Figs. 5(a)-5(d), since the MMA-oligomers within the narrower grooves are influenced
by the groove width, only few MMA-oligomers can enter the grooves. Therefore, the layer
9respectively. In Fig. 6, the orientational order parameters of Type 1 and Type 2 oligomers
decrease with an increase of groove width. For Type 1 oligomers, since the MMA-oligomers
within the narrower grooves of 15 Å to 30 Å are confined by the groove width, the
MMA-oligomers aggregate in the layer arrangement within the narrower grooves of 15 Å to 30 Å.
It means that the interaction between the Type 1 oligomers is weaker than the
substrate/MMA-oligomer interaction strength, so the arrangements of MMA-oligomers form a
layer arrangement within the narrower grooves from 15 Å to 30 Å, shown in Figs. 5(a)-5(d).
When the groove width is wider than 30 Å, since more MMA-oligomers can aggregate with
others within the groove and be able to gradually overcome the adsorption on the walls of groove,
the interaction between the Type 1 oligomers gradually increases with an increase in groove
width. Therefore, the MMA-oligomers exhibit a disordered conformation within the wider 35 Å
groove, as shown in Fig. 5(e). Moreover, the value of order parameter is very close to that of
Type 3, which indicates the arrangement of MMA-oligomers in the wider groove is very similar
to the bulk MMA-oligomer arrangement.
In the case of Type 2 oligomers, although the MMA-oligomers are partially within the
groove and are able to interact with the Type 3 oligomers, the interaction between the Type 2
oligomers is still weaker than the substrate/MMA-oligomer interaction strength, leading to the
interaction between the Type 2 oligomers being unable to overcome the
substrate/MMA-oligomer interaction strength. Therefore, the orientational order parameter of
Type 2 oligomers decreases with the increase of groove width. In Fig. 6, when the Type 2
oligomers interact with the narrower width groove, since the interaction between the Type 2
oligomers is weaker than the substrate/MMA-oligomer interaction strength, the interaction
between the Type 2 oligomers cannot overcome the substrate/MMA-oligomer interaction
strength. This causes the arrangements of Type 2 oligomers to form an ordered conformation as
they adsorbed on the substrates with a narrower groove. With the Type 2 oligomers interacting
with the substrate having a wider groove, the interaction between the Type 2 oligomers gradually
strengthens, so the interaction between the Type 2 oligomers can gradually overcome the
substrate/MMA-oligomer interaction strength. Consequently, the Type 2 oligomers adsorbed on
the substrate of wider groove width form a disordered conformation. In addition, the orientational
order parameter of Type 2 oligomers decreases more dramatically than that of Type 1 oligomers.
This is because a few Type 2 oligomers adsorbed at the edge of groove are influenced by the
walls of groove such that they orderly adsorb. Other MMA-oligomers adsorbed above the top of
groove and interact with the Type 3 oligomers, so the arrangement of MMA-oligomers adsorbed
above the top of groove are more disordered than those adsorbed at the edge of the groove. The
orientational order parameter of Type 2 oligomers, therefore, dramatically decreases when groove
width is wider than 20 Å. However, the orientational order parameter of Type 3 oligomers is
approximately equal to 0.1, which is much lower than those of Type 1 and Type 2 oligomers.
This indicates that the interaction between Type 3 oligomers is stronger than the
substrate/MMA-oligomer interaction strength, so the interaction between Type 3 oligomers can
overcome the substrate/MMA-oligomer interaction strength. Therefore, the Type 3 oligomers
11
oligomers are able to interact with Type 2 oligomers, the Type 1 oligomers will aggregate with
the Type 2 oligomers. This most likely causes parts of Type 1 oligomer to emerge from the
groove to become a Type 2 oligomer. Furthermore, parts of Type 3 oligomers enter the groove to
become Type 2 oligomers because the MMA-oligomers outside the groove are attracted by the
substrate. Therefore, these situations increase or decrease the probabilities of fb<1.
In the present study, the effects of groove depth on the structural behaviors of
MMA-oligomers adsorbed on the substrate were also investigated. Groove depths ranged from 20
Å to 60 Å in increments of 10 Å, and the groove width is set as 20 Å. Figs. 8(a)-8(e) illustrate the
equilibrium conformations of MMA-oligomers adsorbed on the grooved substrates with five
different groove depths: 20 Å, 30 Å, 40 Å, 50 Å, and 60 Å. The substrate/MMA-oligomer
interaction strength is 20 times that of the interaction between MMA-oligomers. From these
results, since the MMA-oligomers within the groove are confined by the groove width,
MMA-oligomers can only aggregate in a layered arrangement to achieve more stable
configurations within the grooves. Therefore, the MMA-oligomers within the groove form a
single layer structure. With an increase in groove depth, more MMA-oligomers can enter the
groove and aggregate with others. This is because the grooves are too narrow and the
arrangements of MMA-oligomers within the grooves are limited by the substrate/MMA-oligomer
interaction strength, so the MMA-oligomers can only form a single layer structure within the
groove for all depths.
Because MMA-oligomers within grooves of different widths display different conformations
as shown in Fig. 5(a)-(e), in order to understand the effect of groove depth on the arrangement of
Type 1 oligomers, the orientational order parameters of Type 1 oligomers within the narrowest
(20 Å) and the widest (35 Å) grooves widths are presented in Figure 9. For the narrowest groove,
as the groove depth is shallower than 30 Å, the orientational order parameter decreases with the
increase of the groove depth. Since the number of Type 1 oligomers increases with increasing
groove depth, Type 1 oligomers gradually aggregate with others to achieve a stable conformation
within the groove. Therefore, the orientational order parameter of Type 1 oligomers decreases
with an increase of groove depth. For grooves deeper than 30 Å, although they can contain more
MMA-oligomers than shallower ones, the arrangement of Type 1 oligomers is still confined by
the groove width, leading to the orientational order parameter of Type 1 oligomers approximately
equal to 0.42. However, in the case of the widest groove, because more MMA-oligomers can
enter the groove and aggregate with others to achieve the most stable conformation within the
groove, the interaction between Type 1 oligomers is stronger than the substrate/MMA-oligomer
interaction strength. This causes the interaction between Type 1 oligomers to overcome the
substrate/MMA-oligomer interaction strength, leading to an orientational order parameter of
Type 1 oligomers approximately equal to 0.2. Consequently, the Type 1 oligomers aggregate
with others and the conformation is similar to bulk PMMA.
The bound fraction was used to observe the conformation of MMA-oligomers adsorbed on
the substrate with different groove depths. Table 2 lists the probabilities of bound fraction of
MMA-oligomers adsorbed on the grooved substrate by different substrate/MMA-oligomer
13
The effects of groove depth on the structural behaviors of MMA-oligomers adsorbed on the
substrate were also investigated. For the groove depth equal to 20 Å, the arrangements of Type 1
oligomers adsorbed on the substrate of shallower groove form an ordered conformation. However,
in the case of groove depth deeper than 20 Å, the arrangement of MMA-oligomers gradually
becomes a disordered conformation. In order to understand the effect of groove depth on the
arrangement of Type 1 oligomers, the orientational order parameters of Type 1 oligomers within
the narrowest (20 Å) and the widest (35 Å) groove widths were determined. For the narrowest
groove, when groove depth was shallower than 40 Å, the Type 1 oligomers aggregatef with
others and the interaction between the Type 1 oligomers was able to overcome the
substrate/MMA-oligomer interaction strength. For grooves deeper than 40 Å, the orientational
order parameter of Type 1 oligomers increases with increasing groove depth. However, in the
case of the widest groove, the orientational order parameter of Type 1 oligomers is
approximately equal to 0.2, with a conformation similar to bulk PMMA. Finally, the number of
Type 1 oligomers decreases with increasing the substrate/MMA-oligomer interaction strength
when the groove is deeper than 20 Å. However, the number of Type 1 oligomers does not have a
significant variance when the groove depth is equal to 20 Å.
