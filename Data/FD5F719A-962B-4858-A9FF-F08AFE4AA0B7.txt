B. Stability Condition and Problem Description 
Recalling the T-S fuzzy model, controller and its 
corresponding stability theorem from [2;3]: 
Theorem 1: The equilibrium of the discrete fuzzy system 
is asymptotically stable in the large if there exists 0>P  
such that

where ( ) ( )[ ] 2iijjjjiiij CFBACFBAR +++≡ , ( ) ( )[ ] 2jkiikjiiijk CFBACFBAS +++≡ , 
except the pair ( )k j i ,,  such that 0kji =hhh , t∀ .  
Proof: Due to lack of space, the proof of Theorem 
1 is omitted.         □□□ 
From Theorem 1, it is easy to find rule interferences, 
ijR  and ijkS , are serious obstacles to design T-S fuzzy 
controller because the total number of LMIs is large 
when the fuzzy controller involves many controller rules. 
The Theorem 1, moreover, is also a NLMI problem.  
There are two difficult questions not easy to handle in 
the T-S fuzzy static output feedback control design (i) 
PDC concept: It was quite obvious that the rule 
interference effects have already increased to three 
indexes ( )k j i ,, . Thus, the PDC stability derivation 
becomes too complicated and confused to design output 
feedback gains. (ii) NLMI problems: LMI optimization 
is a well-known tool in solving the T-S fuzzy control 
problems. However, the set of stability inequalities 
(7)-(9) cannot be directly expressed in terms of the 
LMIs because iC  is located between decision 
parameters iF  and P . Thus, this project proposes to 
solve PDC and NLMI problems in the two sections 
separately. 
First, the T-S fuzzy region system is presented to 
relax the PDC designed process in the following section 
and the detail of NLMI problems can be found in the 
next section.  
 
III. REGIONAL T-S FUZZY CONTROL 
In terms of the above concerns, this project deals 
with the non-convex issue in a nonlinear system which 
was presented by the T-S fuzzy region system [8;9]. At 
first, this project attempts to relax the PDC problems by 
combining fuzzy region concept and robust 
compensation. Here is the structure of region rule:

Substituting the initial population ( )pF , which was 
generated by GAs in section 4.1, into the LMI 
conditions (17) in sequence and then the system (15) is 
asymptotically stable if and only if 0<mint . Therefore, 
the following equation is used as an evaluation index.  
 
        ( ) 0<= minttfitness          (21) 
 
To carry on, we use MATLAB’s GA toolbox [10] to 
search for the mint  until it becomes negative. The index 
0<mint  means there exists Lyapunov matrix X  for the 
system (15).  
From the above analysis, the algorithm structure is 
shown below. 
Step 1: Generate the initial population jF . 
(i) satisfy ( ) 1ji <λ A ,  
(ii) keep the superior population ( ) jj p FF =  to 
fill ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )[ ]Tj21 pppp FFFF L=  by 
GA.  
Step 2: Substitute ( )pF  into Theorem 2 to find 
0>X  and evaluate ( )tfitness .  
Step 3:  
(i) If ( ) 0<tfitness , rearrange the population 
with superior individuals ( )pF .  
(ii) If not, perform the GA process, selection; 
crossover; mutation; new generation and then 
go to Step 2.  
(iii) The algorithm stops if any one of the 
following conditions occurs: 
(a)  generation limit, 
(b)  stall time limit. 
Step 4: Convert ( )pF  into jF  and show the 
solutions jF  and X .

Substituting the above ( )pF  into LMIs (17) in order 
and then GA tunes it to achieve 0<mint  and find 
Lyapunov matrix 0>X . Finally, the result shows 
0-0.0581<=mint . The evaluation process terminated 
after that the static output feedback gains jF  and 
positive define matrix X  were solved simultaneously.

The simulation results with initial state ( ) [ ]2-0.40tx 0 =  of the above methods are 
exhibited in Fig. 5. Based on these results, one can find 
that the proposed approach can use few controller rules 
to stabilize the nonlinear system (22). Moreover, the 
proposed approach, GA/LMI algorithm, provides more 
flexibility in designing T-S fuzzy controller. 
 
VI. CONCLUSIONS 
Because of PDC concept, the rule interference effects 
increases and then stability analysis becomes 
complicated for static output feedback design. Therefore, 
we propose the T-S fuzzy region system to relax the rule 
interference effects of PDC. Although rules were 
reduced, the non-convex problem still exists. A new 
approach of static output feedback controller design has 
presented which mixed GA and LMI algorithm to solve 
NLMI problems. The contributions of this project are 
that (i) rules of fuzzy system are reduced; (ii) the 
synthetic procedures only use simple mathematical 
derivations and fundamental control concept. The 
superiorities of this method are verified in the numerical 
example.
