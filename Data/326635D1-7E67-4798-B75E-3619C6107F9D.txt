I. INTRODUCTION 
前言、研究目的、文獻探討 
Bandpass filters are essential building blocks 
for communication systems. They can reduce 
the harmonic and spurious emissions for 
transmitters, and may improve the rejection of 
interferences for receivers. To ease the 
integration between bandpass filters and other 
active devices, many previous works on planar 
filter design were reported [1]. Among various 
types of planar filters, the parallel-coupled 
bandpass filter based on half-wavelength (λ/2) 
resonators exhibits the merits of simple 
synthesis procedure, good repetition, and a 
wider range of realizable fractional bandwidth 
[1], [2]. However, the conventional microstrip 
parallel-coupled bandpass filter requires a large 
circuit area and suffers from the spurious 
response at twice the center frequency (2f0), 
making the rejection of the upper stopband 
worse than the lower stopband. This is due to 
the unequal even and odd mode propagation 
constants for microstrip coupled-line sections 
[3]. Many works have been reported to tackle 
this issue [3]-[7]. However, these techniques 
either rely on complex design/optimization 
procedures [3]-[5] or limit the filter to specific 
circuit configurations [6]-[7]. 
On the other hand, microstrip bandpass filters 
based on quarter-wavelength (λ/4) resonators 
may feature more compact circuit size as well 
as better stopband rejection with no spurious 
response at 2f0 [8]-[9]. In our previous works 
[10]-[12], novel microstrip parallel-coupled 
bandpass filters using open-ended coupled-line 
sections and lumped inductors as K-inverters 
were proposed so as to integrate the merits of 
conventional parallel-coupled filters and λ/4 
resonator filters. In addition, by introducing the 
capacitive cross-coupling effect, two 
transmission zeros were created. Those filters 
feature compact sizes, good selectivity with no 
spurious response at 2f0, and retain the merit of 
simple synthesis procedure as conventional 
parallel-coupled filters. 
In this study, the miniature lumped- 
distributed coupled-line section is first 
introduced. It is achieved by adding lumped 
capacitors to the open-ends of a conventional 
coupled-line section such that the required 
length of coupled-line can be largely reduced 
while maintaining approximately the same 
characteristics around the center frequency. 
Based on this miniaturization concept, more 
compact parallel-coupled bandpass filters with 
lumped-element K-inverters compared to 
[10]-[12] are then proposed by adopting the 
proposed lumped-distributed coupled-line 
sections in the filter design. In addition, the 
parallel-coupled bandpass filters based on 
short-ended coupled-lines and lumped-element 
J-inverters are also proposed to achieve lower 
power loss compared to their open-ended 
counterpart [10]-[12]. Moreover, with the 
capacitive or inductive cross-coupling effect, 
the proposed filters may achieve two 
transmission zeros at the upper and lower 
stopbands with better upper stopband rejection. 
Simple equivalent-circuit models and design 
formulas for the two classes of proposed filters 
are also established to facilitate the filter 
design. 
II. FILTER STRUCTURES 
研究方法 
A. Lumped-distributed coupled-lines 
Shown in Fig. 1(a) is the circuit model of a 
coupled-line section that is commonly used for 
filter design [13]. A conventional 
parallel-coupled bandpass filter is achieved by 
cascading multiple coupled-line sections in Fig. 
1(a) with the length of each coupled-line 
section being λ/4 long. In order to reduce the 
size of the filter through a reduction of 
coupled-line length, additional shunt capacitors 
C are added to the two open-ends in Fig. 1(a), 
such that the required coupled-line length θ’ 
for the resulted lumped-distributed 
coupled-line section [Fig. 1(b)] can be reduced. 
The values of C and θ’ are chosen such that the 
electrical length of each transmission line 
remains approximately a λ/4. Since the amount 
of coupling for the lumped-distributed 
coupled-line section is reduced due to the 
reduction of coupled-line length, the even and 
 4
bandpass filter based on the lumped-distributed 
coupled-line sections. Through a proper 
selection of C2, θ'1 and the coupled-line 
impedances Z’0e and Z’0o, the proposed 
miniature filter in Fig. 4 can achieve nearly the 
same response around the passband with a 
much smaller circuit size compared to the one 
in Fig. 3(a). Moreover, with the two shunt 
capacitors C2 on the cross-coupling path in  
Fig. 4, the upper stopband rejection can also be 
improved, for the high-frequency signals 
passing through the cross-coupling path are 
reduced. 
C. Parallel-coupled bandpass filter with 
lumped-element J-inverters 
Shown in Fig. 5(a) is the circuit model of 
proposed 2nd-order parallel-coupled bandpass 
filter with lumped-element J-inverter [15]. 
Here an additional series capacitor C, to realize 
the J-inverter, is added between the two 
coupled-line sections of the conventional 
1st-order parallel-coupled bandpass filter based 
on short-ended coupled-line sections. In this 
way, the short-ended λ/2 resonator in a 
conventional parallel-coupled filter becomes 
two λ/4 resonators coupled through the 
capacitor C. In addition, a small cross-coupled 
shunt inductor Lcross is introduced between the 
short-ends of two coupled-line sections for 
creating additional transmission zeros. 
By neglecting the small shunt inductor first, 
i.e. Lcross = 0, the equivalent-circuit model of 
this filter structure for frequencies around the 
passband may be obtained as shown in     
Fig. 5(b). Here the short-ended coupled-line 
section of length θ1 may be modeled by a 
K-inverter along with two transmission line 
sections of characteristic impedance Z0 = 1/Y0 
and length θ1 at its two ends. In addition, the 
series capacitor C, together with two 
transmission line sections of characteristic 
impedance Z0 = 1/Y0 and length φ1/2 at its two 
ends, may be equivalent to a J-inverter [13]. 
Therefore, the resulted equivalent-circuit 
model [Fig. 5(c)] is then equivalent to a 
2nd-order direct-coupled λ/4 resonator 
bandpass filter, with θ1 - φ1/2 = π/2. As a result, 
by introducing the additional series capacitor C 
to realize the J-inverter, the order of filter is 
doubled without increasing the circuit area. 
Note that the filter structure in Fig. 5(a) may be 
viewed as the dual configuration of the filter 
structure in [11], and it will have exactly the 
same frequency response as the one in [11] 
under the same specifications. 
The cross-coupled inductor Lcross in Fig. 5(a) 
is used to create the additional transmission 
zeros, with a similar mechanism to that of [11]. 
By noting that the signal through the 
cross-coupled path is substantially less than the 
one through the main path, the design of 
proposed filter can be simplified by first 
neglecting the cross-coupled effect, i.e. Lcross = 
0. Based on the equivalent-circuit models in 
Fig. 5, the design procedure of proposed filter 
[Fig. 5(a)] may be summarized as follows. First, 
according to the specified center frequency, 
3-dB bandwidth, and reference impedance, the 
required J- and K-inverter values in Fig. 5(c) 
are obtained through the conventional filter 
synthesis techniques for a direct-coupled λ/4 
resonator bandpass filter [13]. Second, the 
corresponding coupled-line impedances are 
determined, and the C value and φ1 are 
calculated according to the corresponding 
J-inverter value based on [13]. The required 
coupled-line length θ1 is then obtained by θ1 = π/2 + φ1/2. Third, the cross-coupled element 
Lcross is included and its value is adjusted for 
the desired locations of transmission zeros 
according to the specifications. 
III. RESULTS 
結果與討論 
The proposed miniature 4th-order 
parallel-coupled bandpass filter in Fig. 3 is 
implemented in the microstrip configuration, 
and is fabricated on a RO4003c substrate (εr = 
3.38, tanδ = 0.002, and thickness h = 20 mil). 
The filter is designed with a center frequency 
of 5 GHz, a 3-dB bandwidth of 15%, and a 
reference impedance of 50 ohm based on the 
4th-order maximally flat response. The 
parameters in the equivalent-circuit model    
[Fig. 3(c)] are obtained from the conventional 
filter synthesis techniques [13]. The required 
coupled-line impedances, electrical lengths, L 
value, and C values can be calculated based on 
the proposed equivalent-circuit model. The 
filter layout and geometrical parameters are 
shown in Fig. 6. Here the shunt capacitors C1 
and C2 are realized by shunt-connected 
open-stubs. The shunt inductor L2 is realized 
 6
inductance. Based on the proposed 
equivalent-circuit models, the filter design may 
simply follow the conventional filter synthesis 
techniques. In addition, the size of proposed 
filter is much more compact than the 
conventional parallel-coupled bandpass filter. 
The proposed filters are useful for applications 
in the communication systems when low loss, 
high selectivity, and good stopband rejection 
are required.

Z0o = 47ohm, and θ = 90o at 5GHz, while for the proposed 
lumped-distributed coupled-line section [Fig. 1(b)], Z’0e = 
60ohm, Z’0o = 51.5ohm, θ’ = 45o at 5GHz, and C = 0.566pF. 
The two circuits have exactly the same ABCD parameters at 
the center frequency of 5GHz, but the length of proposed 
lumped-distributed coupled-line section is only half that of the 
conventional coupled-line section. Shown in Fig. 2(b) are the 
simulated frequency responses of the transmission coefficient 
for these two circuits. It is observed that the amplitude and 
phase responses of the two coupled-line sections are exactly 
the same at 5GHz, and are very close to each other around 
5GHz. Therefore, for narrowband filter design, by replacing 
the conventional coupled-line sections with the proposed 
lumped-distributed coupled-line sections, one may largely 
reduced the filter size while maintaining the similar 
performance. In addition, the larger the C value, the shorter 
the coupled-line length θ’ can be achieved. 
The proposed lumped-distributed coupled-line section [Fig. 
1(b)] is applied to the design of a miniature 4th-order 
microstrip bandpass filter, which is based on an extension of 
the 2nd-order parallel-coupled filter in [11]. Shown in Fig. 3(a) 
is the original circuit model of the proposed 4th-order filter. It 
is achieved by adding one shunt inductor L2 between the two 
coupled-line sections of a conventional 1st-order parallel-
coupled filter, with two additional shunt capacitors C1 
introduced at the input and output ports. In this way, the open-
ended λ/2 resonator in the conventional parallel-coupled filter 
becomes two λ/4 resonators coupled through the inductor L2. 
The input and output ports are coupled to the λ/4 resonators 
through the two shunt capacitors C1. In addition, a small 
cross-coupling series capacitor Ccross is introduced between the 
open-ends of two coupled-line sections to create a cross-
coupling path for generating two transmission zeros at the 
upper and lower stopbands [10]-[12].The locations of 
transmission zeros may be adjusted by varying the value of 
Ccross. Compared to the 4th-order filter in [12], the proposed 
filter uses shunt coupling capacitors C1 instead of inductors at 
the input and output ports, such that the rejection at upper 
stopband may be improved.

equivalent-circuit model    [Fig. 3(c)] are obtained from the 
conventional filter synthesis techniques [13]. The required 
coupled-line impedances, electrical lengths, L value, and C 
values can be calculated based on the proposed equivalent-
circuit model. The filter layout and geometrical parameters are 
shown in Fig. 5. Here the shunt capacitors C1 and C2 are 
realized by shunt-connected open-stubs. The shunt inductor L2 
is realized by a metal-coated through-hole via to ground. The 
capacitive cross-coupling Ccross is achieved by the gap-coupled 
capacitance between the two coupled-line sections. The 
measured and simulated results are shown in Fig. 6. The 
simulation is done by the full-wave simulation tool Ansoft 
HFSS. The measured center frequency is at 4.77GHz, with an 
insertion loss of 2dB and a 3-dB bandwidth of 12.5%. Good 
agreement between measured and simulated results is 
observed except for a slight frequency shift. Two transmission 
zeros are found as expected. Note that no repeated passband at 
2f0 is observed due to the equivalence to the λ/4 resonator 
filter. Compared to the 4th-order filters in [12], the rejection at 
upper stopband is better due to the two shunt capacitors C2 on 
the cross-coupling path and the resonance of the two open-
stubs for realizing C1. Note that the implemented filter (Fig. 5) 
is a little less than λ/2 long, making it less than 2/5 the size of 
conventional parallel-coupled filter of the same order. 
By introducing lumped-elements in filter design, the 
proposed filters possess the merits of more compact size, 
better selectivity, low loss, good stopband rejection, and 
simple synthesis procedure. The filter size can further be 
reduced by choosing a larger C2. In addition, based on the 
proposed equivalent-circuit models, the filter structures can 
easily be extended to realize higher-order filters for improved 
performance. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
In this study, novel microstrip parallel-coupled bandpass 
filters based on lumped-distributed coupled-line sections have 
been proposed and carefully examined. By introducing 
additional lumped capacitors to the conventional coupled-line 
sections, the required coupled-line length can be reduced such 
that the miniaturization of bandpass filter can be achieved. 
Through the introduction of lumped-element K-inverters 
along with the capacitive cross-coupling effect, the proposed 
bandpass filters exhibit two transmission zeros at the upper 
and lower stopbands, and have the advantage of no repeated 
passband at 2f0. The locations of transmission zeros may 
easily be adjusted by varying the cross-coupling capacitance. 
Based on the proposed equivalent-circuit models, the filter 
design may simply follow the conventional filter synthesis 
techniques. In addition, the size of proposed filter is much 
more compact than the conventional parallel-coupled 
bandpass filter. The proposed filters are useful for 
applications in the communication systems when low loss, 
high selectivity, and good stopband rejection are required.

 introduced between the short-ends of two coupled-line sections 
for creating additional transmission zeros. 
By neglecting the small shunt inductor first, i.e. Lcross = 0, the 
equivalent-circuit model of this filter structure for frequencies 
around the passband may be obtained as shown in Fig. 1(b). 
Here the short-ended coupled-line section of length θ1 may be 
modeled by a K-inverter along with two transmission line 
sections of characteristic impedance Z0 = 1/Y0 and length θ1 at 
its two ends. Consider a symmetric coupled-line with 
homogenous medium, the relationship between the coupled-
line even and odd mode admittances, i.e. Y0e and Y0o, with the 
K-inverter value may be obtained as follows:

In addition, the series capacitor C, together with two 
transmission line sections of characteristic impedance Z0 = 1/Y0 
and length φ1/2 at its two ends, may be equivalent to a J-
inverter [13]. Therefore, the resulted equivalent-circuit model 
[Fig. 1(c)] is then equivalent to a 2nd-order direct-coupled λ/4 
resonator bandpass filter, with θ1 - φ1/2 = π/2. As a result, by 
introducing the additional series capacitor C to realize the J-
inverter, the order of filter is doubled without increasing the 
circuit area. Note that the filter structure in Fig. 1(a) may be 
viewed as the dual configuration of the filter structure in [11], 
and it will have exactly the same frequency response as the one 
in [11] under the same specifications. 
The cross-coupled inductor Lcross in Fig. 1(a) is used to create 
the additional transmission zeros. The physics for creating the 
transmission zeros may be illustrated in Fig. 2. Here the Path 1 
in Fig. 2(a) represents the main signal path for the proposed 
filter, while the inductor Lcross provides a second cross-coupled 
path (Path 2) along which the signal would cancel the one 
traveling along Path 1 at certain frequencies. Simulated 
frequency responses by circuit simulator for the proposed filter 
along Path 1 and Path 2 are shown in Fig. 2(b). The signals 
from these two paths have the same amplitude and are nearly 
180o out-of-phase at two frequencies, and they would cancel 
out each other at these two frequencies. Therefore the overall

 Shown in Fig. 5 are the measured results for the filter in Fig. 3 
with different Lcross values by adopting different number of vias. 
An even larger Lcross may be obtained by replacing the vias by 
a microstrip shorted stub. As Lcross increases with fewer vias 
used, the transmission zeros move toward f0 at the expense of 
decreasing the insertion loss at stopband. Therefore, according 
to the given specifications, one may determine the required 
Lcross value for the desired locations of transmission zeros. 
Although requiring vias in the fabrication process as in the 
case of microstrip λ/4 resonator filters, the proposed filters 
possess the merits of more compact size, better selectivity, low 
loss, good stopband rejection, and simple synthesis procedure. 
In addition, based on the proposed equivalent- circuit models, 
the filter structures can easily be extended to realize higher 
order filters for improved selectivity. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
In this study, novel parallel-coupled microstrip bandpass 
filters with lumped-element J-inverter have been proposed and 
carefully examined. By introducing additional lumped 
capacitor to realize J-inverter, along with the inductive cross-
coupling effect, the proposed bandpass filters exhibit two 
transmission zeros at upper and lower stopbands, and have the 
advantage of no repeated passband at 2f0. The locations of 
transmission zeros may easily be adjusted by varying the cross-
coupled inductance. Based on the proposed equivalent-circuit 
models, the filter design may simply follow the conventional 
filter synthesis techniques. In addition, the size of proposed 
filter is more compact than the conventional parallel-coupled 
bandpass filter. The proposed filters are useful for applications 
in the communication systems when low loss, high selectivity, 
and good stopband rejection are required.
