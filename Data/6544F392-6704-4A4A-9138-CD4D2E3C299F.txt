codewords to be blocked in decoding. In the other hands, if an error patterns examined by a 
likelihood examination criterion could generate a likely codeword, the re-encoding process then 
proceeds to generate the corresponding codeword. Otherwise, this error pattern is immediately 
deleted. And this examination process will continue until an error satisfies the likelihood 
examination criterion and a corresponding codeword is encoded. Once this codeword satisfies the 
criterion of optimality condition, this decoding process stops and outputs this codeword as a 
decoded codeword. 
For an (N, K) Reed Solomon (RS) code over GF(2m), a codeword generation in a binary image 
code of code length mN and information length mK takes the complexity of O(m2NK) bit operations. 
Assuming that all MRI positions of a size of mK are inverted during decoding, the complexity of 
decoding is O(2mkm2NK) bit operations. However, its nonbinary codeword generation only takes the 
complexity of O(mNK) bit operations, provided that a nonbinary operation is equivalent to m-times 
of a binary operation. Considering that all MRI nonbinary positions of a size of K are inverted, the 
total decoding complexity is equivalent to O(2mkmNK) bit operations. Although it draws attraction, 
whose complexity is less than that of binary decoding, it is still huge especially that either 
parameters m or K is large. In this study, based on quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) 
signaling, we propose a suboptimal decoding of the nonbinary re-encoding process with much less 
complexity than that. 
The paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews a brief presentation in the re-encoding 
process of a binary image of an RS code with binary signaling. Section III proposes the nonbinary 
re-encoding process of an (N, K) RS code with QAM transmission. There are two proposed criteria 
for likelihood examination and optimality condition in this section. The complexity analysis of 
proposed decoding is shown Section IV. Finally, conclusion and simulation of RS(255, 233, 33) 
code with QAM signaling over AWGN channels are presented in Section V.

3. Proposition of re-encoding process for an RS code with QAM signaling 
A codeword of an (N, K, Dmin) RS code of over GF(2m) is transmitted with QAM signals. Let 
an element ∈iV GF(2m), and its QAM signal mapping is denoted as ))(,)(()( yixii VSVSVS = , where 
xiVS )( and yiVS )(  are the components of real-axis and imaginary-axis of )( iVS .  The vector

MRI positions of R  are selected. According to those MRI positions, performing corresponding 
row operations in a generator matrix G , we obtain the corresponding systematic generator matrix

4. Computational Complexity  
 As we have mentioned before, there are 3 steps involved in the re-encoding process: 1) 
compute of symbol reliability of R and find MRI positions, 2) perform row operations in the 
generator matrix based on those MRI positions and form a systematic generator matrix, 3) with help 
of criterion 1, generate a sequence of codewords and stop decoding once a decoded codeword 
meeting criterion 2. 
 Actually we don’t need to calculate all symbol reliability in GF(2m) for every R∈iR . Firstly, 
we only find the reliability of the nearest four-symbol points via properly locating each iR on a 
signal space constellation, which it takes the time complexity of O(N). The most reliable (MR)
