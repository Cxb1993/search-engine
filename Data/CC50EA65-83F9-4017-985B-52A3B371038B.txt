stant matrices independent of z. In this re-
port, we study precoded OFDM systems with
APU precoding matrices.

Fig. 1 shows the block diagram of a precoded
OFDM system. In a precoded OFDM trans-
mitter, the kth input block s(k), consisting
ofM modulation symbols such as QAM sym-
bols, is first passed through an M by M pre-
coding matrix T(z). The output of T(z) is
given by
u(k) =
N−1∑
i=0
Tis(k − i). (1)
In this report, the precoding matrix T(z) is
chosen as a normalized APU matrix so that:
T˜(z)T(z) = IM .
That means, all the entries are scaled by
1
√
MN . In practice, this normalization con-
stant can be absorbed into the signal power
of modulation symbols. After taking the M -
point IDFT of the vector u(k), we get the
M × 1 vector:
x(k) =WHu(k),
where W is the DFT matrix with [W]kl =
exp(−j2pikl/M). Note that, unlike the
conventional block transmission system, the
transmitted block x(k) contains information
of the input blocks s(k), s(k − 1), . . . , s(k −
N + 1). Before x(k) is transmitted, a cyclic
prefix (CP) of length L is added. In this re-
port, we assume that the channel is slowly
varying so that for each OFDM block, the
channel response does not vary. We model
the combined effect of DAC, transmit filter,
channel, receive filter and ADC as an equiv-
alent discrete time system with c(n, k) de-
noting the nth tap of the impulse response
when the kth block is sent. We also as-
sume that the CP length L is large enough
so that the length of the equivalent channel
is ≤ (L + 1). That is for all k, c(n, k) = 0
whenever n > L+ 1. The channel noise ν(n)
is assumed to be AWGNwith varianceN0. At
the receiver end, to remove the inter block in-
terference, the first L samples of the received
block that correspond to the cyclic prefix are
discarded. We obtain the M × 1 vector r(k).
Taking the DFT of r(k), we get
y(k) =Wr = C(k)u(k) + ν(k), (2)
where C(k) is an M × M diagonal matrix
whose (`, `)-th entry is given by the DFT
coefficient of the channel impulse response
c(n, k):
C`(k) =
L+1∑
n=0
c(n, k)e−j2pin`/M . (3)
The noise vector ν(k) is an AWGN vector.
Assume that the channel does not have spec-
tral null so that C(k) is invertible. After mul-
tiplying the diagonal matrix C−1(k), we get
û(k) = u(k) +C−1(k)ν(k). (4)
In the absence of channel noise, the vector
uˆ(k) = u(k) for all k. When the precoding

D 1: An OFDM system with APU precoding matrix T(z).
When we take T(z) = IM , the system in Fig.
1 becomes the conventional uncoded OFDM
system. In this case u(k) = s(k). Thus, for
uncoded OFDM system, we can obtain from
(4) the output noise variance at the ith sub-
band as
σ2i,ofdm(k) =
N0
|Ci(k)|2 . (7)
The average output noise variance is
σ2av,ofdm(k) =
1
M
M−1∑
i=0
N0
|Ci(k)|2 . (8)
From (7), we see that σ2i,ofdm(k) depends on
both k and i and it is inversely proportional
to |Ci(k)|2. Recall that |Ci(k)| is the chan-
nel gain at the ith frequency bin when the
kth block is sent. For highly frequency selec-
tive channels, some of the gains |Ci(k)| can
be close to zero and the performance of the
OFDM system will be affected by these spec-
tral nulls.
If we allow the definition of APU matri-
ces to include complex matrices whose coef-
ficients have unit magnitude, then the DFT
matrixW is APU. When we take T(z) =W,
the system in Fig. 1 becomes the SC-FDE
system [3]. By carrying out the same deriva-
tion, one can show that the noise variance of
the SC-FDE system can be obtained by sim-
ply setting N = 1 in (6). The noise variance
at the ith subband when the kth block is sent
is given by
σ2i,sc(k) =
1
M
M−1∑
n=0
N0
|Cn(k)|2 . (9)
Observe from the above expression that
σ2i,sc(k) is independent of i. All the sub-
bands have the same noise variance and
they are equal to the average noise variance
σ2av,ofdm(k) in (8).
We can clearly see the difference between
the conventional OFDM, the SC-FDE and
the APU precoded OFDM systems from the
three expressions in (7), (9) and (6). Be-
cause the decoding matrices T˜(z) (for pre-
coded OFDM system) andWH (for SC-FDE
system) are PU, they have the energy (or
power) conservation property [1]. The aver-
age output noise variance for the three sys-
tems is the same. However they distribute
these noise variances to the subbands dif-
ferently. For the conventional OFDM sys-
tem, each subband can have a very different
noise variance, especially when the channel is
highly frequency selective. From (7), we see
that subbands having small |Ci(k)| will suf-

where Λ(i) = EsC
H(i)

EsC(i)C
H(i) +

)−1
. Note that Λ(k) is a diagonal ma-
trix whose nth diagonal entry is given by
λn(k) =
C∗n(k)
|Cn(k)|2 +N0/Es .
From the above expressions, we see that the
MMSE receiver can be decomposed into a
time-varying diagonal matrix Λ(k) and the
time-invariant matrix T˜(z). When there is
no noise, i.e. N0 = 0, the MMSE receiver
reduces to the zero-forcing receiver.
One can verify that for precoded OFDM
system with an MMSE receiver, all the sub-
bands also have the same error variance and
it is given by
σ2mmse(k) =
1

N−1∑
`=0
M−1∑
n=0
N0
|Cn(k + `)|2 +N0/Es︸ ︷︷ ︸
σ2(n,`,k)
.
(14)
One can clearly see from the above expres-
sion that the decoding matrix T˜(z) has an
averaging effect in both frequency and time-
domain; it averages over all subbands and
over N OFDM blocks. Moreover the quan-
tities σ2(n, `, k) are upper bounded by Es.
When some of the channel gains |Cn(k + `)|
approach zero, the error variance σ2mmse(k)
does not go to infinity. As we will see in the
next report that by using an MMSE receiver,
the performance of the precoded OFDM sys-
tem is improved significantly.

We carry out Monte-Carlo experiments to
verify the performance of precoded OFDM
systems with different precoders. The trans-
mission channels are the modified Jakes fad-
ing channels described in [6]. In the ex-
periments, we will use channel models with
two different ratios of doppler frequency over
transmission bandwidth. A larger value of r
indicates that the channel is changing faster.
The ratio r = 0.0001 corresponds to a slowly
varying channel whereas r = 0.001 corre-
sponds to a channel that varies 10 times
faster. The number of taps of the channels
is 16. The channel noise ν(n) is AWGN with
variance N0. In our simulation, we assume
that the receiver knows the exact channel re-
sponse. The DFT size is M = 64 and the
length of cyclic prefix is L = 16. The input
vector s(n) consists of QPSK symbols with
power equal to Es.
APU matrices of different length N will be
used as the precoding matrices. When N =
1, the APU matrix reduces to the Hadamard
matrix. It is known [3] that the OFDM
system with a Hadamard precoding matrix
has the same bit error rate performance as
the SC-FDE system. We plot the bit error
rate curves versus SNR (signal to noise ra-
tio), which is equal to Es/N0. In the simula-
tion, we do not consider MMSE receiver for
the conventional OFDM system because the
bit error rate performance of OFDM systems
with MMSE receivers is identical to that of
OFDM systems with zero-forcing receivers.

In this project, we have successfully
found an application for the APU matri-
ces, which were proposed in the previous
year. We have studied the OFDM sys-
tems with an APU matrix as precoder.
The precoded systems are analyzed in
detail. Moreover we have carried out nu-
merical simulations to verify our results.
The simulation showed that by using an
APU precoding matrix, the output noise
is averaged in both time and frequency
domain. And it showed that precoded
OFDM systems with MMSE receivers
have a significantly better performance
