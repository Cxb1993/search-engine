With increasing miniaturization of electronic products, the packaging size for solder joints has
been reduced greatly. However, this size reduction has given rise to some new reliability problems.
One of the most noticeable problems is the electromigration of solder alloys [1-11].
Electromigration refers to the phenomenon of atomic migration induced by current stressing [12].
The driving force for the atomic migration results from the momentum exchange during the
collisions between moving electrons and atoms, so the atoms will migrate in the direction of the
anode side. The directional atomic migration can cause microstructural change, including solder
extrusion at the anode side and void formation at the cathode side. Severe microstructural change
may lead to failure of the solder joints.
Due to the harmful effect of Pb toxicity on environment and human health, finding suitable
Pb-free solders to replace the Pb-containing solders is currently an urgent task for the electronic
industry. Among many Pb-free solders, eutectic SnBi solder is a likely replacement, especially for
processes that are sensitive to temperature or thermal damage, because of its lower melting point
and coefficient of thermal expansion [13]. Because electromigration has been considered as an
important concern in the reliability evaluation of solders, it is important to understand the effects of
electromigration on eutectic SnBi solder. However, only limited reports can be found [7-10]. In
these reports, the Bi atoms are found to migrate to the anode side under electromigration. Because
Bi is the dominant diffusing species, most of the discussion regarding the solder’s electromigration
has concentrated on the Bi migration. By comparison, the Sn migration seems to be less significant
and has lacked discussion. In the present study, we find that after the Bi migration the Sn atoms can
also migrate to the anode side under electromigration. More interestingly, Sn lumps are formed at
the cathode side, which indicates the presence of an opposite Sn migration toward the cathode side.
Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of the specimen for electromigration test. A bi-layer of
Ti/Cu thin film was deposited on an oxidized Si wafer using electron beam evaporation. The
thicknesses of Ti and Cu were 200 and 4000 Å, respectively. By using photolithography and lift-off
technique, a Ti/Cu stripe with square pads at the two ends was patterned. The stripe was 10 mm in
length and 300m in width. The Cu stripe was coated with flux, and a tiny solder piece was placed

region the solder sinks. The polished sample shown in Figure 2(c) indicates that the sunken region
contains mostly Sn. The surface morphology in the right-hand side region is flat and both Sn and Bi
phases are detected in this region, as shown in Figure 2(c). At the anode side, several hillocks are
formed, as shown in Figure 2(b). Compositional analysis indicates that these hillocks are Sn. In
addition, a continuous extrusion of Bi formed along the edge of the solder stripe is observed, and
this extrusion looks like a wall. The polished sample shown in Figure 2(d) reveals that a large
number of Bi atoms have accumulated at the anode side after current stressing.
The results shown in Figure 2 indicate that at 2.9104 A/cm2 current density electromigration
plays a major role on the atomic migration. Exposure of the Cu6Sn5 phase at the cathode side
indicates that the solder portion above the exposed Cu6Sn5 phase is removed, i.e. mass transports of
both Sn and Bi take place under electromigration. In the neighboring region, the solder sinking
indicates that mass transport also takes place. However, because only Sn is detected, the main
contribution to the mass transport is Bi. Therefore, it can be concluded that electromigration can
induce the migration of both Sn and Bi, but the migration of Bi is faster than that of Sn. In other
words, Sn begins to migrate after most of the Bi has moved away. The Bi migration induced by
electromigration will lead to mass accumulation of Bi at the anode side, as shown in Figure 2(d).
The Sn hillock formation at the anode side is considered to result from the Bi accumulation. From
the comparison between Figure 2(b) and 2(d), the regions underneath the Sn hillocks are almost
Bi-rich, i.e. those marked by dotted circles in Figure 2(d). The Bi accumulation at the anode side
creates a compressive stress, and in order to release the stress, the Sn atoms are squeezed out of the
solder stripe.
Figure 3 shows SEM images of the eutectic SnBi solder stripe under the same reaction
conditions as Figure 2, but the current density is raised to 4.4104 A/cm2 density. It is noteworthy
that the microstructure shown in Figure 3 is very different from that in Figure 2. Although part of
the solder has been removed from the cathode side, no solder sinking is observed but many Sn
lumps are formed near the cathode side instead, as shown in Figure 3(a). At the anode side, the Bi
wall is also formed along the edge of the solder stripe but the morphology of the interior solder

electromigration. We consider that the driving force for the reversed migration is back stress. Under
electromigration, atoms will be pushed by electron flow toward the anode side, and then build up a
compressive stress there. In contrast, a tensile stress will be generated at the cathode side due to the
departure of atoms. According to the Nabarro-Herring model [14], the vacancy concentration is
lower at the compressive anode side but is higher at the tensile cathode side. Hence, a vacancy
concentration gradient is built up decreasing from cathode to anode. Driven by the vacancy
concentration gradient, atoms will migrate from the anode side to the cathode side. Equation (1) is
then rearranged to equation (2) by adding an additional term, JBS, to take into consideration the
effect of back stress.

whereis the stress,is the atomic volume, and x is the distance along the electron flow.
Back stress has been discussed explicitly in the electromigration of a pure Al stripe [15,16].
Since Al is the only migrating species, the back stress is induced by the electromigration of Al and
acts only on the Al atoms. However, for a multi-phase alloy, the interaction of electromigration and
back stress may be slightly different. For example, in a two-phase alloy like the eutectic SnBi alloy
in the present study, both Bi and Sn can migrate toward the anode side under electromigration.
While the electromigration rate of Bi is faster than that of Sn, excess Bi atoms will migrate to the
anode side prior to Sn. Then, back stress will be generated. Atomic migration must take place from
the anode side to the cathode side in order to release the back stress. Since the electromigration
effect is comparatively insignificant for the Sn atoms at the anode side, the Sn atoms are likely to be
pushed back toward the cathode side by back stress. As a result, a reversed migration of Sn
generates. It is concluded that back stress is induced by the electromigration of the primary
migrating species, Bi, but acts on the secondary migrating species, Sn. A similar result is also
reported in the electromigration of eutectic SnZn alloy [11]. In the eutectic SnZn alloy, Sn is the
primary migrating species which will migrate toward the anode side under electromigration. Back
stress is then induced by the electromigration of Sn and is found to promote a reversed Zn migration
