英文摘要 
In this project we consider the secure transmission with multiple-input, single-output, single-antenna 
eavesdropper (MISOSE) in fast fading channels with full knowledge of the legitimate channel and only 
the statistics of the eavesdropper's channel state information at the transmitter. For the MISOSE systems, 
the artificial-noise (AN) assisted beamforming proposed by Goel and Negi is a promising technique, 
where the AN is imposed in the null space of the legitimate channel to disrupt the eavesdropper's 
reception. In this project we propose a new generalized AN (GAN) scheme which allows the injection of 
AN to the legitimate receiver's channel, and generalize the AN of Goel and Negi. Although the GAN 
scheme may cause the leakage of AN at the legitimate receiver, the secrecy rate can still be improved 
since the AN covariance matrix in our scheme is more flexible than the heuristic one selected by Goel and 
Negi. Then the secrecy rate optimization problem of the proposed GAN scheme is studied. We show that 
the complicated optimization problem over the covariance matrices of the message-bearing signal and the 
GAN can be reduced to a much simpler power allocation problem. We then develop an algorithm to 
efficiently solve this non-convex power allocation problem. Numerical results show that our optimized 
GAN scheme outperforms Goel and Negi's heuristic AN selection, especially when the quality of the

2I. INTRODUCTION
Traditionally, the security of data transmission has been ensured by the key-based enciphering. However,
for secure communication in large-scale wireless networks, the key distributions and managements may
be challenging tasks [1] [2]. The physical-layer security introduced in [3] [4] is appealing due to its
keyless nature. One of the fundamental setting for the physical-layer security is the wiretap channel. In
this channel, a source node wishes to transmit messages securely to a legitimate receiver and to keep
the eavesdropper as ignorant of the message as possible. Wyner first characterized the secrecy capacity
of the discrete memoryless wiretap channel [3]. The secrecy capacity is the largest rate communicated
between the source and legitimate receiver with the eavesdropper knowing no information of the messages.
Motivated by the demand of high data rate transmission, the multiple antenna systems with security concern
were considered by several authors. Shafiee and Ulukus [5] first proved the secrecy capacity of a Gaussian
channel with two-input, two-output, single-antenna-eavesdropper. Then the authors of [6]–[8] extended
the secrecy capacity result to the Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output, multiple-antenna-eavesdropper
channel. On the other hand, due to the characteristics of wireless channels, the impacts of fading channels
on the secrecy transmission were considered in [9]. Note that works in [3], [5]–[9] require full channel
state information at the transmitter (CSIT). However, considering practical issues such as the limited
bandwidth of the feedback channels or the speed of the channel estimation at the receivers, perfect CSIT
may not be available in practice. Therefore, several works considered the secrecy transmission with partial
CSIT [10]–[14]. The artificial noise (AN) assisted secure beamforming is a promising technique for the
partial CSIT cases, where in addition to the message-bearing signal, an AN is intentionally transmitted
to disrupt the eavesdropper’s reception [10] [11].
In this project, we consider an important type of wiretap channels with partial CSIT, namely, the
multiple-input single-output single-antenna-eavesdropper (MISOSE) fading wiretap channels. We assume
that the transmitter has perfect knowledge of the legitimate channel and only the statistics of the eavesdrop-
per channel. Although the secrecy capacity of the considered channel is unknown, the rate performance
of the AN-assisted beamforming has been shown to be capacity-achieving in the high signal to noise
ratio (SNR) regime when the transmitter is equipped with a large number of antennas [11]. However, in
the regimes of reasonable SNR and number of antennas, the heuristically selected covariance matrix of
AN in [10] [11] may not be optimal, where the AN is restricted to be transmitted in the null space of
the legitimate channel. This motivates our study on generalizing and optimizing the AN assisted secure
beamforming in [10] [11].
The main contribution of this project is to propose a generalized AN (GAN) assisted secure beamform-
ing, and optimizing its secrecy rate. Our scheme is a generalization of those in [10] [11], and has a better
secrecy rate performance according to our numerical simulations. More specifically, our AN covariance
matrix is more flexible than the ones in [10] [11], for which the ANs are restricted to be transmitted in
the null space of the legitimate channel. We further show that the complicated secrecy rate optimization
problem over covariance matrices can be reduced to a much simpler power allocation problem. To attain
this interesting result, we first prove that the optimal covariance matrix of the message bearing signal
is unit rank. Then we identify the structure of the GAN covariance matrix. Based on these results, we
show that the secrecy rate is a function of only three variables, where two of them are related to the
covariance matrix of the GAN, and the remaining one is related to the covariance matrix of the message-
bearing signal. Although our simplified rate optimization problem is a power allocation problem with
only three scalar variables, it is a non-convex stochastic optimization problem. We develop an algorithm
to efficiently solve this problem and provide a criterion to check if the power allocation found by our
algorithm satisfies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions or not. Numerical results confirm that the
optimized GAN provides rate gains over the heuristic AN in [10]. In particular, the non-zero rate region is
enlarged by the GAN. Note that secure connectivity in a network is assured by the non-zero secrecy rates
of the transmitter-receiver pairs [2]. Thus our scheme is very useful for the large scale wireless network
applications, which constitute an important type of applications of the MISOSE wiretap channels [1] [2].
4where w is the secret message, zn, hn, and gn are the collections of z, h, and g over code length n,
respectively. The secrecy capacity Cs is the supremum of all achievable secrecy rates.
From Csisza´r and Ko¨rner’s argument [4], we know that the secrecy capacity with statistical CSIT of
Eve’s channel can be represented by
C = max
p(x|u), p(u)
I(u;y)− I(u;z|g), (4)
where u is an auxiliary random variable. However, for our considered CSIT setting, where the CSIT is
not fully known, the optimal p(x|u) and p(u) are still unknown. We apply the linear channel prefixing
and Gaussian signaling to p(x|u) as
x= u+v, (5)
where u∼CN(0,Su) and v∼CN(0,Sv) are independent vectors to convey the message and generalized
AN (GAN), respectively. In addition, the feasible channel input covariance matrices of the signal and
GAN belong to the set
S= {(Su,Sv) : tr(Su+Sv)≤ PT ,Su ≽ 0,Sv ≽ 0}, (6)
where PT is the maximum allowed transmit power. Note that our GAN can be transmitted in all directions
of the space spanned by h, but the AN in [10] is only allowed to be transmitted in the null space of h.
Thus our GAN scheme generalizes the AN in [10]. We further denote the eigenvalue decompositions of
Su and Sv as UDuUH and VDvVH , respectively.
Substituting (1), (2), and (5) into (4), we have the secrecy rate with generalized AN (GAN) as
RGAN = max
Su,Sv∈S
(
log
(
1+hH (Su+Sv)h
1+hHSvh
)
−E
[
log
(
1+gH (Su+Sv)g
1+gHSvg
)])+
. (7)
We can further transform (7) into the following form to simplify the problem
RGAN =
(
max
Su,Sv∈S
(
log
(
1+hH (Su+Sv)h
1+hHSvh
)
−E
[
log
(
1+gH (Su+Sv)g
1+gHSvg
)]))+
. (8)
Compared with (7), in (8), the maximum is placed inside the operation (.)+, and the reasons come as
follows. For (7), if there exist Su and Sv such that the term inside the (.)+ is positive, then (7) is equal
to (8). On the other hand, if there are no Su and Sv such that the term inside the (.)+ of (7) is positive,
both (7) and (8) are zero. Thus we know that (7) and (8) are identical. In the following sections, we will
solve the secrecy rate optimization problem for the proposed GAN assisted beamforming (GAN-BF).
III. OPTIMIZATION OF THE SECRECY RATE OF THE GAN ASSISTED BEAMFORMING
In this section, we identify the structure of the optimal solutions S∗u and S∗v for the GAN-BF optimization
problem. We first prove the optimal signaling of message bearing signal is beamforming, i.e., S∗u is unit
rank. We then solve the beamformer with the assumption that one eigenvector of Sv is parallel to the
beamformer of the message bearing signal. Note that the heuristically selected beamformers in [10] [11]
is still a special case of ours even under this assumption. By exploiting the structure of optimal S∗u and
S∗v, we transform the complicated optimization problem over the covariance matrices, into a much simpler
one in Theorem 3. That is, the secrecy rate of the GAN-BF is characterized by only three scalar variables,
i.e., the power of the message bearing signal PU , the power of AN in the signal direction PVs , and the
power of AN in the null space of signal direction PVr . Note that in [10] [11], PVs is always zero, which
is only a subset of our feasible solution set. And thus the schemes in [10] [11] is suboptimal compared
with ours. Contrary to our proposed GAN, the authors in [10] [11] directly assume that the AN is only
transmitted in the null space of the main channel, such that only the first term on the right hand side
(RHS) of (8) affects the optimization problem. Therefore the direction of message bearing signal can be
easily observed as parallel to the main channel. However, when the GAN is used, both two terms on the
RHS of (8) need to be considered, which results in a non-convex problem and is much more involved
than those considered in [10] [11].
6where the first inequality in (19) comes from letting k = nT − 2 in (9) of Lemma 1; and the second
inequality in (19) comes from the fact that the E[M∗] in (16) is a negative-definite matrix by definition.
Then the largest eigenvalue λnT (E[M∗]) of E[M∗] is negative. Thus from (19), we know that
λi(A∗)< 0, i= 1,2, . . . ,nT −1. (20)
We will show that λ in (18) is positive when RGAN in (8) is positive, and then together with (20) and
(18) this theorem will be proved. First, from (16),
tr
(
a∗ (a∗)H S∗u
)
=
hHS∗uh
1+hH (S∗u+S∗v)h
= 1− 1+h
HS∗vh
1+hH (S∗u+S∗v)h
, (21)
tr(M∗S∗u) =−
gHS∗ug
1+gH (S∗u+S∗v)g
=−
(
1− 1+g
HS∗vg
1+gH (S∗u+S∗v)g
)
, (22)
note that tr(M∗S∗u) is a random variable since g is a random vector. Now if RGAN in (8) is positive, then
log
(
1+hH (S∗u+S∗v)h
1+hHS∗vh
)
> E
[
log
(
1+gH (S∗u+S∗v)g
1+gHS∗vg
)]
,
and from [12, Lemma 8], (
1+hHS∗vh
1+hH (S∗u+S∗v)h
)
< E
[(
1+gHS∗vg
1+gH (S∗u+S∗v)g
)]
.
From (21) and (22), the above inequality becomes 1− tr
(
a∗ (a∗)H S∗u
)
< 1+E[tr(M∗S∗u)]. Then
tr
(
a∗ (a∗)H S∗u
)
+E[tr(M∗S∗u)] = tr
((
a∗ (a∗)H +E[M∗]
)
S∗u
)
= tr(A∗S∗u)> 0,
if RGAN > 0. Then λ= tr(A∗S∗u)/tr(S∗u)> 0 if RGAN > 0, i.e., tr(S∗u)> 0. Note from [17] we know that λ is
also the largest eigenvalue of A∗. Then, to meet (18) with (20) and λ> 0 if RGAN > 0, the eigenvalues of
S∗u corresponding to negative eigenvalues of A∗ must be all zeros. Thus S∗u is rank one, if RGAN > 0. The
case where RGAN = 0 can always be achieved when there is no signal transmission which also satisfies
our claim.
Based on the fact that the optimal Su is unit rank, we then find the characteristics of the S∗u and
S∗v assuming that Sv has one common eigenvector with Su (the eigenvector of Su corresponding to the
non-zero eigenvalue.) Note that the beamformers U and V in [10] [11] are selected heuristically without
any claim of optimality, and are special cases of ours even under this assumption. First, from the KKT
conditions of (8), we have the following necessary condition for the optimal S∗v and S∗u,
S∗uBS
∗
v = 0= S
∗
vBS
∗
u, (23)
where B is given in (17). The first equality in (23) is obtained by subtracting (11) from (10), and then
left and right multiplying the result by S∗u and S∗v respectively with the simplification by (12) and (13).
The second equality in (23) comes from changing the multiplication orders stated above. Following the
spirit of [12], we name the pair (Su, Sv) satisfying the necessary condition (23) as the KKT solution. And
denote the eigenvector of Su corresponding to the non-zero eigenvalue as u1. Now we have
Theorem 2: For the secrecy rate optimization problem in (8), the only KKT solution (Su, Sv) with
Su = PUu1uH1 and Sv having the eigenvectors V= [u1,u
⊥
1 ] satisfies that u1 = h/||h||.
Proof: Since the optimal Su is unit rank and the assumption that Sv has one eigenvector common
with u1, we can expand (23) as

Proof: With Theorem 2, letting Dv = diag(PV1 ,PV2, . . . ,PVnT ), the RGAN in (8) becomes

(30) is independent of the powers PV2 , . . . ,PVnT . Thus for any fixed PU and PV1 , the maximization over

Observing the denominator of (31), we can find that with fixed PU and PV1 , the optimal solution always
happens when the equality in (32) holds since G˜i ≥ 0, which concludes our proof.
Based on Lemma 2, we can find the covariance matrix for the GAN as following. Note that the noise
power in the signal direction may not always equal to zero, and the scheme in [10] may perform worse
compared with ours.
Theorem 4: For the secrecy rate-optimization problem of the GAN-BF in (8), with Su = PUhhH/||h||2
and Sv having the beamformers V= [h/||h||,(h/||h||)⊥], the optimal covariance matrix of the GAN is

Proof: First, we focus on the optimization problem (31), but replacing (32) with equality according
to Lemma 2. We will show that the equal power allocation is optimal for this problem, that is, PVr =

IV. THE ITERATIVE ALGORITHM FOR POWER ALLOCATIONS BETWEEN SIGNAL AND
GENERALIZED ARTIFICIAL NOISE
Although we have simplified the optimization problem in (8) as (28), which is a non-convex stochastic
optimization problem, it is still difficult to analytically solve the optimal power allocation PU , PVs , and
PVr in (28). Thus in this section we propose an iterative power allocation algorithm summarized in Table
I, which can find solutions almost the same as the brute-force search. However, the complexity of the
proposed algorithm is much lower than the one based on brute-force search, such as [10]. More specifically,
the brute force search requires searching on a plane simultaneously for the three variables PU , PVs , and
PVr . However, the proposed algorithm divides the search into two simple sub-problems each needs much
less complexity than the brute-force one. Before introducing the iterative algorithm, we first provide a
useful result in Theorem 5 to test the optimality of power allocation found by the proposed algorithm.
First define
Fk (x) =
∫ ∞
0
xe−t
(1+ xt)k
dt = e1/xEk (1/x) ,
where Ek(x) is the En-function [21]. With the proof given in the Appendix, we then have
Theorem 5: The necessary condition for the power allocation (PU ,PVs ,PVr) to be optimal for (28) is
that if the following inequality is met

with the requirement PVs > 0.
Now we present the derivation of the proposed iterative algorithm. The key idea of the proposed
algorithm is as following. To prevent the high complexity of simultaneously solving PU , PVs , and PVr , we
try to divide the problem as smaller ones and we can simply use the bisection method to solve them.
More specifically, by eliminating the Lagrange multipliers in the KKT conditions, we form two equations
such that each has different variables to be solved. Then through iteratively solving these two equations,
12
For the ith iteration, given P(i)Vs , we can find the new (PU ,PVr) from f2(PU ,P
(i)
Vs ,PVr) = 0 as shown in (50).
By setting PU = (PT −PVr−P(i)Vs )/(nT −1), f2(PU ,PVs ,PVr) becomes a function with only one variable PVr
and can not be easily solved. Denote the resulted PVr as P
(i+1)
Vr . Then given P
(i+1)
Vr , we can also numerically
solve a new PVs from f1(PVs ,P
(i+1)
Vr )=0 according to (48). We let the resulted PVs as P
(i+1)
Vs which can be
used in the (i+1)th iteration and the iterative algorithm follows. Note that the bisection method can be
used to perform the numerical search of PVs and PVr , which costs much less complexity than directly full
search for optimizing (3).
Based on the concept described above, we explain each step in Table I in detail. First, numerically
finding the tuple (PVs ,PVr ,PU) which exactly meets the equality (48) and (50) is difficult. Therefore we
relax (48) and (50) by inequalities
| f1(PVs ,PVr)|< ε1 and | f2(PU ,PVs,PVr)|< ε1, (51)
respectively, where ε1 is a predefined small constant. Once the values found by the bisection search validate
the above inequalities, they are treated as the solutions of these inequalities. Together with the iteration
steps described in the end of the previous paragraph, we obtain Step 2 and 3 in Table I. Second, relaxing
equalities (48) and (50) to inequalities (51) makes the solutions depend on ε1 and may not satisfy the
KKT conditions. Thus as in Step 4 of Table I, we substitute the analytical results into Theorem 5 to verify
the optimality of the solutions. Finally, the initial values for the first iteration in Step 1 are obtained as
follows. Note that two initial values are needed for specifying the search region of the bisection method. For
initializing the bisection method used in Step 2, the two initial values for solving P(i+1)Vr are 0 and PT −P
(i)
Vs ,
such that the corresponding values of function f2 will have opposite signs. Similarly, for initializing the
bisection method used in Step 3, the two initial values for solving P(i+1)Vs are 0 and PT − (nT − 1)P
(i)
Vr .
Therefore, in the ith iteration, the search regions are [0,PT −P(i)Vs ] and [0,PT − (nT −1)P
(i)
Vr ] for f2 and f1,
respectively. If the maximum of f2(PU ,P
(i)
Vs ,P
(i)
Vr ) in the interval [0,PT −P
(i)
Vs ] is still negative, we know
that there does not exist any P(i)Vr in this interval to satisfy f2(PU ,P
(i)
Vs ,P
(i)
Vr ) = 0 given P
(i)
Vs . In this case,
we set PU = 0 as the solution of f2(PU ,P
(i)
Vs ,P
(i)
Vr ) = 0 given P
(i)
Vs . From numerical results, according to the
iterative algorithm in Table I, the powers P(i)U , P
(i)
Vs , and P
(i)
Vr will converge to those fully searched, which
satisfy the KKT necessary conditions.
Remark 1: Note that in Section IV we assume that PU , PVs ,and PVr are all non-zeros to eliminate the
multipliers. For channel conditions under which low rank AN covariance matrix is optimal, the proposed
algorithm may have PVs converge to a value approximate zero. When this value is smaller than a predefined
threshold ε2, we claim that PVs = 0 is optimal.
V. NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, we illustrate the performance gain of the proposed transmission scheme over Goel and
Negi’s. We use a 2 by 1 by 1 channel as an example. Assume that the noise variances at Bob and Eve are
normalized to 1 mW. From (28) we know that the rate RGAN only depends on the norm of the legitimate
channel. Therefore, we use ||h||2 = 0.1 and 0.2 to indicate different channel conditions in the numerical
simulation. For the statistics of the eavesdropper’s channel, we set E[G˜1] = E[G˜2] = 1. In Fig. 2, 3, and
4 which correspond to ||h||2 = 0.2, 0.1 and 0.05, respectively, we compare the rates of Goel and Negi’s
scheme to those of our proposed signaling with the generalized AN. The curves marked by circle and thick
line represent searching the optimal power allocations of (28) exhaustively and by the proposed iterative
algorithm, respectively. In the iterative algorithm, we set δ = 10−5 and ε1 = ε2 = 10−5. From Fig. 2, 3,
and 4, we can easily see that the proposed generalized AN scheme indeed provides apparent rate gains
over Goel and Negi’s scheme in the low receive SNR regions. Besides, from numerical results we can
find that PVs and PVr are not all zeros, thus the rate without AN in [12] is suboptimal. In addition, we can
observe that the rate gains decrease with increasing ||h||2, which is consistent with the results in [13]. We

We now provide the proof of Theorem 5. From the KKT condition of (8) which takes the first derivative
of the Lagrangian with respect to Sv, with U= V, we have C−λInT +ψTv = 0 where

Similar to (18), we have
DCD∗v = D
∗
vDC = tr(CS
∗
v)D
∗
v, (57)
where DC and D∗v are the diagonal matrices composed by eigenvalues of C and S∗v, respectively. From
(57), the necessary condition for D∗v to be optimal with P∗Vs > 0 is that when tr(CS
∗
v)> 0, C does not have
any negative eigenvalues; or, when tr(CS∗v)< 0, C does not have any positive eigenvalues. Next, we will
find when this property will hold. Now we check the eigenvalues of C if tr(CS∗v)> 0. From [12, Lemma
5], all eigenvalues of C are positive implies l(0)> 0, where
l(λ) = 1− cH (UYUH +λInT )−1 c. (58)
Note that l(λ) is a strictly increasing function when λ > 0. By Lemma 4 we know
(
UYUH
)−1 exists.
Then we can expand l(0)> 0 from (58) as
1> cH
(
UYUH
)−1 c. (59)
After substituting c from (55) into (59), and using the fact that the optimal U= [h/||h||, (h/||h||)⊥] from
Theorem 2 and Y is invertible from Lemma 4, we have
Y1,1 >
||h||4P∗U(
1+ ||h||2P∗Vs
)(
1+ ||h||2 (P∗U +P∗Vs)) .
Then by the definition of Y in Lemma 4 and explicitly calculate the expectation, Y1,1 equals to the
left-hand-side (LHS) of (40). Then the “>” part in (40) comes from the above inequality. In addition,
tr(CS∗v)> 0 implies

1+ ||h||2(PU +P∗Vs)

> 0. (60)
After some arrangement, the LHS of (60) can be represented by the LHS of (39), and the “>” part of
(39) is valid. The case where tr(CS∗v)< 0 can be derived similarly, which results in the “<” parts in (39)
and (40).
