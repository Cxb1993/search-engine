I. Introduction
Control of nonlinear systems is an important topic in industrial applications. In recent years,
using the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model [1, 2] representation of nonlinear systems, well-known
linear control theory has been extensively applied to nonlinear system control problems. This is
possible due to the fact that the original nonlinear system is represented by T-S fuzzy models with
consequent part consisting of several local linear subsystems. Then using parallel distributed
compensation (PDC), the controller design and stability analysis are carried out using Lyapunov direct
method which reformulates the control objectives into solving a linear matrix inequality problem
(LMIP) [3]-[7]. In addition, when immeasurable states exist, studies [8, 9] provide a T-S fuzzy
observer-based stabilization schemes with conditions in LMIPs. Unfortunately, except for some works
[10]-[16] which discuss the tracking or regulation control, most results focus on the stabilization
problem of nonlinear systems.
On the other hand for tracking problems, a robust tracking scheme is proposed in [10] using the
command signal taken as disturbance to the closed-loop system whereas the residual tracking error is
then attenuated. For regulation, on the other hand, feed-forward compensation of linear control theory
is used in [11] and [12]. Furthermore, varying or static output tracking objectives has been investigated
in [13]-[15]. However,high interaction among plant rules and controller rules will lead to failure has
been pointed out in [16]. To solve this by T-S fuzzy model-based control, the fuzzy gain scheduling
[19] and integral control schemes [20] are introduced for regulating the output of dc-dc converters.
Although [20] provides better performance, the gain is designed from the pole assignment techniques.
To the best of our knowledge, current results of controlling biased chaotic systems are focused on
stabilization and synchronization [18]-[22]. The minimal results are due to the fact thatexternal
disturbance make direct PDC nontrivial. From the above, we are motivated to propose a novel output
tracking control approach.
The control of time-delay systems is a challenging problem in engineering. Time delays
frequently occur in many practical systems (such as chemical processes, nuclear reactors, long
transmission lines, and telecommunication, etc.). Since time-delay cause instability and poor
performance in a system, control of such systems has received considerable attention in the past
decade. Different approaches, e.g., [23]-[28], have been proposed. Generally speaking, the previous
stability analysis can be classified as delay-dependent [23]-[26] and delay-independent [27]-[28]. The
delay-dependent methods need exact information on the duration of delay, whereas a relaxed stability
condition is obtained. On the other hand, the delay-independent methods do not need any information
of the delay. These delay-independent approaches are more suitable for practical applications. Both

measured output; t is the initial condition;  is the time-delay in the state; t and tv are
the external disturbance and measured disturbance, respectively.
Using the singleton fuzzifier, product fuzzy inference and weighted average defuzzifier, the
inferred output of the fuzzy system is

Note that  tzri 1 = 1 for all t , where  tzi ≥0, fori = r,,2,1  , are regarded as the
normalized weights. In system (1), for simplicity we assume   0000 bB  with scalar
00 b and )(tx with an interested region .
In order to convert a output tracking problem into a stabilization one, we introduce a set of virtual
desired variables (VDVs)      txtxtxtx dnddd 21 which are to be tracked the state tx .
Define   txtxtx dh  denote the tracking error. Then, the time derivative of txh yields

For the tracking error system (2), the tracking control design for tu is to solve a stabilization
problem. Now, the fuzzy controller tuk is designed based on parallel distributed compensation
(PDC) as follows:
:iRuleController
IF tz is iF1 andand tz f is fiF THEN
   txtxKtu dik 
where iK are constant control gains to be determined. The inferred output of the controller is with
the following form:
tuk =    txtxKtz diiri  1
then 0J . By integrating (6) from 0 to ft , we obtain

The tracking control has H performance. According to the Schur complement, we have (5).
Remark 1: Noting that condition (5) implies
01   didiii XAPARPHPH ,
we get  0tV if  0t . This means the tracking error system (4) is asymptotically stable. If
there exist a symmetric and positive definite matrix P , some matrices iK  ri ,,2,1  and

Unfortunately, there exist some problems here i) the states are assumed to be available; and ii) the
virtual desired states are not determined. Therefore, the idea control law (3) might be unavailable, thus
it might lead to the failure of designing controller.
III. Observer-Based Output Tracking Control
In this section, we consider the observer-based control design based on the VDVs approach for a
class of nonlinear time-delay systems. The proposed fuzzy observer is described by the following
fuzzy rules:
Observer Rule i :
IF tz1ˆ is iF1 andand tz fˆ is fiF THEN
       tytyLtButxAtxAtx idii ˆˆˆˆ  
 txCty ˆˆ 
where  nRtx ˆ and  nRty ˆ are the estimated state and output respectively;  tztz fˆ~1ˆ are the
premise variables composed of estimated states; iL are observer gains to be determined. Notice that
       tutuBtxAtxAtztx kddidiri id  1 ˆ .
Therefore, we have the error dynamic

Next section, we determine the virtual desired variables.
IV. Virtual Desired Variables Design
The control objective is to drive all states in )(tx to track the virtual desired states )(txd with H
control performance. The VDVs are determined according to the following equations
)()( txty did  (26)
i,1,,2,1)],()())[(ˆ()( ,,1    ntxAtxAtztx ddidiri id  (27)
where )(tyd is the controlled output. In most practical application, )(tyd is one of the desired state
such that solve (26) and (27) to obtain VDVs )(txd . Therefore, the tracking error )(txh can be
obtained. Note that the premise variable )(ˆtz is composed of estimated state which can be obtained
from observer.
For implementation the control input (15), the derivative signal )(txdn is required. Obviously, if
the desired output is )()( txty dnd  , then )(txdn can be obtained such that the controller (15) can be
implemented. On the other hand, the desired output )(tyd is not )(txdn , this case might lead to the
failure of designing the controller (15). One may use an approximate signal as
TTtxtxtx dndndn  /))()(()( , where T is the sampling period. Fortunately, suitably choosing
observer gains iL and controller gains iK can attenuate the effect.

Output Tracking Control for Discrete Time-Varying Delay Systems
via Virtual Reference Model Based Approach
Teng-Shung Chiang and Chian-Song Chiu∗, Member, IEEE
Abstract— This paper proposes an output tracking control
via virtual reference model for a class of discrete-time systems
with time-varying delay and disturbances. In this proposed
scheme, we combine a virtual reference model (VRM) and
an observer-based fuzzy control strategy to develop output
tracking controller. The Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy observer is used
to estimate immeasurable state, while the controller is designed
to guarantee the overall control system with H∞ control
performance. Sufficient conditions are derived in a linear matrix
inequality form Lyapunov’s stability method. Moreover, the
VRM-based fuzzy synthesis is fully illustrated by an example
of discrete-time stirred tank reactor system. The effectiveness
of the proposed controller is finally demonstrated and shown
from satisfactory numerical results.
I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, using the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy
model [1] representation, well-known linear control theory
has been extensively applied to nonlinear system control
problems. This is because the original nonlinear system is
represented by T-S fuzzy models with consequent part con-
sisting of several local linear subsystems. By using parallel
distributed compensation (PDC), the controller design and
stability analysis are carried out, in which the control objec-
tive is reformulated into solving a linear matrix inequality
problem (LMIP) [2]. In addition, when immeasurable states
exist, many studies (cf. [4]) provide a T-S fuzzy observer-
based stabilization schemes with conditions in LMIPs.
The control of time-delay systems is a challenging prob-
lem in engineering. Time delays frequently occur in many
practical systems (such as chemical processes, nuclear reac-
tors, long transmission lines, and telecommunication, etc.).
Since time-delay causes instability and poor performance in
a system, control of such systems has received considerable
attention in the past decade. Generally speaking, the previous
stability analysis can be classified as delay-dependent [7] and
delay-independent [8]. The delay-dependent methods exactly
need information on the duration of delay, whereas a relaxed
stability condition is obtained. On the other hand, the delay-
independent methods do not need any information of the
delay. These delay-independent approaches are more suitable
for practical applications. The works [9], [11] achieve the
control object which wok well at around the stationary point.
However, most of current literature to deal with stability or

stabilize to equilibrium for time-delay systems applications.
To overcome this drawback, an output tracking control
scheme is required for time-delay systems. Note that for
solving the output tracking problem of non-delayed systems
a concept of virtual desired variables (VDVs) is proposed
in [10]. This conception designs a controller to enforce the
system state to track a set of VDVs. The VDVs need to
satisfy a constraint of generalize kinematics. The advantage
of VDVs approach is unifying the stabilization and tracking
control design. From the above, we are motivated to propose
output tracking control via VDV based on T-S fuzzy model
for time-delay systems with disturbances.
In this paper, a new output tracking control approach is
proposed for a class of time-delay system with disturbances.
First, the T-S fuzzy model is adopted for modeling the time-
delay nonlinear system. Next, a set of VDVs is designed
based on virtual reference model (VRM). Third, we com-
bine VRM methodology and observer-based fuzzy control
strategy to develop an output tracking controller. Sufficient
conditions are derived for stabilization by Lyapunov method
and formulated as LMIs. In this control system, the observer
estimates immeasurable states and the controller guarantees
H∞ control performance. The advantages of the proposed
output control system are i) the control output directly tracks
the desired output signal; and ii) the overall control system
is guaranteed with H∞ control performance. Moreover, the
VRM-based synthesis is fully illustrated on an example of
discrete-time stirred tank reactor system. The effectiveness
of the proposed controller is finally demonstrated and shown
from satisfactory numerical results.
II. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
Consider a class of discrete-time delay nonlinear systems
which are described by the following T-S fuzzy model:
Plant Rule i :
IF z1(t) is F1i and · · · and zf (t) is Ffi THEN
x(t + 1) = Aix(t) + Adix(t− τ(t))
+ Bu(t) + w(t)
y(t) = Cx(t) + v(t)
yc(t) = Dx(t)
x(t) = ϕ(t), t ∈ [−τ0 0]
where x(t) ∈ Rn and u(t) ∈ R are the state and control
input respectively; Ai, B, Adi, C, D are matrices with
appropriate dimensions; z1(t) ∼ zf (t) are the premise
variables composed of states; Fji (j = 1, 2, · · · , f) are

978-1-4244-8126-2/10/$26.00 c©2010 IEEE 2541
where zd(t) = [zd1(t) zd2(t) · · · zdn(t)]T . The fuzzy
controller uk(t) is designed based on parallel distributed
compensation (PDC) as follows:
Controller Rule i :
IF zˆ(t) is F1i and · · · and zˆf (t) is Ffi THEN
uk(t) = −Ki(xˆ(t)− xd(t))
where Ki are the control gains to be determined. The inferred
output of the controller is
uk(t) = −
∑r
i=1
μi(zˆ(t))Ki(xˆ(t)− xd(t)). (4)
Define tracking error xh(t) = xˆ(t) − xd(t), then the error
dynamics can be expressed as
xh(t + 1)
=
∑r
i=1
μi(zˆ(t)) [(Ai −BKi)xh(t) + h2(t)
+Adixh(t− τ¯) + LiCe(t) + Liv(t)]
where h2(t) =
∑r
i=1(μi(zˆ(t)) − μi(zd(t)))[Aixd(t) +
Adixd(t − τ¯)]. The different premise variables between
observer and VRM lead to h2(t).
After manipulation, the augmented error system can be
expressed as
xe(t + 1) =
∑r
i=1
μi(zˆ(t))
[
Gixe(t) + h¯(t)
+Mdixe(t− td) + Eiwe(t)] (5)
where
xe(t) =
[
eT (t) xTh (t)
]T
we(t) =
[
vT (t) w¯T (t)
]T
Gi =
[
Ai − LiC 0
LiC Ai −BKi
]
Mi =
[
Adi 0

]
Ei =
[ −Li I
Li 0
]
.
Next, we will determine the control gain and observer gain
to guarantee that the augmented error system has H∞ control
performance.
IV. H∞ PERFORMANCE CONTROL DESIGN
For the augmented error system (5), different premise
variables lead to the perturbations h1(t) and h2(t). Further
analysis on these perturbations we assume that the mem-
bership functions satisfy a Lipchitz-like condition. Although
different fuzzy systems with different premise variables, but
they are the same simple function in this paper.
Notice that μi(z(t)) = wi(z(t))/
∑r
i=1 wi(z(t)) with
wi(z(t)) =
∏f
j=1 Fji(z(t)) and
∑r
i=1 μi(z(t)) = 1,
the membership function Fji(z(t)) satisfy Fji(z(t)) −
Fji(zˆ(t)) = ηTji (z(t) − zˆ(t)) for some bounded function
vector ηT
ji
and z(t), zˆ(t) in the interest region. This mean
that the membership functions satisfy a Lipchitz-like con-
dition. Due to the premise variables composed of states,
thus Fji(z(t)) − Fji(zˆ(t)) can be written as Fji(x(t)) −
Fji(xˆ(t)) = ηTji (x(t)− xˆ(t)). We can conclude the following
property:
The membership function error μi(x(t)) − μi(xˆ(t)) is
proportional to the estimation error e(t) = x(t) − xˆ(t). In
light of property, we have
h1(t) =
∑r
i=1
(μi(x(t)) − μi(xˆ(t)))
·[Aix(t) + Adix(t− τ(t))]
=
∑r
i=1
[
(Aix(t) + Adix(t− τ(t))) ΓT1i
]
e(t)
According to x(t) and x(t − τ(t)) are bounded in our
interest region and Assumption 2, the term h1(t) satisfies
the bounded
hT1 (t)h1(t) ≤ eT (t)UT1 U1e(t)
with a exist matrix function U1 depend on ΓT1i, x(t) and
x(t− τ(t)). Similarly,
h2(t) =
∑r
i=1
[
Aixd(t) + Adixd(t− τ¯ )ΓT2i
]
xh(t)
Since VDVs xd(t) and xd(t− τ¯) are bounded in our interest
region, the term h2(t) satisfies
hT2 (t)h2(t) ≤ xTh (t)(t)UT2 U2xh(t)
with a existing matrix function U2 dependent on ΓT2i, xd(t)
and xd(t− τ¯ ). From the above discussion, we summarize
h¯T (t)h¯(t) ≤ xTe (t)(t)U¯T U¯xe(t)
where U¯ =block-diag(U1, U2).
Although the undesired terms h1(t) and h2(t) will affect
the control performance, suitably choosing observer gains Li
and controller gains Ki can attenuate the effect.
Let us rewrite the H∞ tracking performance which relates
to the error e(t) and xh(t), if initial values are also consid-
ered, as follows:∑tf
t=0
xTe (t)Qxe(t)
≤ xTe (0)Pxe(0) + ρ2
∑tf
t=0
wTe (t)we(t)
+
∑τ0
q=1
xTe (−q)Sxe(−q) (6)
where P = PT > 0 and S = ST > 0.
Theorem: In nonlinear system (1), if P = PT > 0
and S = ST > 0 are the common solution of the matrix
inequalities (7) for all i, then the close loop system (5)
is stable and the H∞ tracking control performance (6) is
guaranteed for a prescribed attenuation level ρ2.⎡⎣ H¯i1 (∗) (∗)MTi PGi H¯i2 (∗)

where H¯i1 = GTi P (P + I)−1PGi + S − P + U¯TPU¯ +

−1PMi − S and H¯i3 =
ETi P (P + I)
−1PEi − ρ2I . 

Step 2: Given ρ, Q2 and U2, the matrix inequalities in (14)
is equivalent to the following matrix inequalities:⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣
Ω¯2 (∗) (∗) (∗) (∗)
0 Λ (∗) (∗) (∗)

AiX2 −BFi AdiX2 0 X2 + X2X2 (∗)
U2 0 0 0 X2
⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ > 0
where Ω¯2 = X2 − Λ − X2(Q2 + 3UT2 U2)X2, X2 = P−12 ,
Fi = KiX2 and Λ = X2S2X . This implies that⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣
X2 − Λ (∗) (∗) (∗) (∗) (∗)

U2 0 0 0 X2 (∗)
X2 0 0 0 0 Ψ
⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ > 0
(15)
where Ψ = (Q2 + 3UT2 U2)−1.
Step 3: Find P > 0 and Λ > 0 to satisfy (12).
Notice that, in the three-step procedure, the dimensions
of matrices P1, P2, S1, S2 ∈ Rn×n and the matrices P ,
S ∈ R2n×2n are different, which in turn means we are more
flexible in choosing U¯ .
V. SIMULATION RESULTS
To verify the theoretical derivations, we take time-delay
system as an application example.
Example : Consider a stirred tank reactor (STR) described
by the following dimensionless discrete-time dynamic equa-
tions (cf. [9]):
x1(t + 1) = [f1 + (
1
λ
− 1)x1(t− τ(t))]ΔT
+x1(t) + ω1(t)
x2(t + 1) = [(
1
λ
− 1)x2(t− τ(t)) + βu(t)]ΔT
f2ΔT + x2(t) + ω2(t)
y(t) = x2(t) + v(t) (16)
where
f1 =
−1
λ
x1(t) + Da(1− x1(t))f0
f2 = −( 1
λ
+ β)x2(t) + HDa(1− x1(t))f0
f0 = exp
(
x2(t)
1 + x2(t)/γ0
)
.
Note that the state x1(t) is the dimensionless conversion
rate of the reaction; the state x2(t) is the dimensionless
temperature which is assumed to be positive (i.e., x2(t) > 0);
ΔT denotes the sampling period; τ(t) is a time-varying delay
with an upper bound 2.4/ΔT ; λ ∈ (0, 1] is the recycle
coefficient; H , Da, β, and γ0 are system parameters; and
ω1(t), ω2(t) are external disturbances. The parameters in this
example are given as λ = 0.8, β = 0.3, ΔT = 0.02,
H = 8, Da = 0.072, and γ0 = 20. Disturbances ω1(t),
ω2(t) and measured disturbance are assumed to be uniformly
distributed with amplitude 0.02, 0.02 and 0.002, restrictively.
After some manipulation, the dynamic equations (16) can
be expressed as follows:[
x1(t + 1)
x2(t + 1)

[
a11 a21
a21 a22

]

λ + Daf0
)
, a22 =
1 − ΔT ( 1λ + β −HDafb) , a21 = DaΔTf,
a21 = −HDaΔTf0, ad = ( 1λ − 1)ΔT and fb = f0/x2(t)
which is well-defined at x2 ∈ (0.1 6]. To fuzzify the system
matrix, the state x2(t) is taken as the premise variable.
According to the fuzzy modeling method [5], we choose the
following membership functions:
F1 =
(
D0 − f0
D0 − d0
)(
Db − fb
Db − db
)
F2 =
(−d0 + f0
D0 − d0
)(
Db − fb
Db − db
)
F3 =
(
D0 − f0
D0 − d0
)(−db + fb
Db − db
)
F4 =
(−d0 + f0
D0 − d0
)(−db + fb
Db − db
)
where D0 ≡ maxx2∈Ω2 f0, d0 ≡ minx2∈Ω2 f0, Db ≡
maxx2∈Ω2 fb(, db ≡ minx2∈Ω2 fb, and Ω2 is a proper
discussion set for x2. Considering the operational region
x2 ∈ (0.2 6], the fuzzy parameters are found as D0 =
0.6901, d0 = 0.3099, Db = 0.6439, and db = 0.3561.
The control parameters are set as ρ = 0.9, Q = 0.1I ,
U = 0.1I , and ΔT = 0.02. Based on Theorem, we obtain
the control gains
K1 = [ −151.1021 195.0821 ],
K2 = [ −151.1064 166.6722 ],
K3 = [ 47.9844 195.0945 ],
K4 = [ 48.0013 166.6690 ]
and observer gains

Maximum Power Control of Wind Energy Conversation Systems
via a T-S Fuzzy Model-based Approach
Chian-Song Chiu∗, Member, IEEE, Teng-Shung Chiang, and Ya-Ting Lee
Abstract— This paper proposes a T-S fuzzy model based
maximum power control to enhance the efficiency of the
wind power generation systems. To draw the maximum wind
energy, a buck converter is applied to adjust the recified
output voltage of the permanent-magnet synchronous generator.
Based on the T-S fuzzy representation of the system, the fuzzy
maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controller is developed
to maintain the maximum power voltage. The MPPT control
guarantees asymptotic convergence, while control gains can
be systematically designed by solving linear matrix inequality
(LMI). Furthermore, the robust MPPT is also discussed to cope
with varying wind speed and system uncertainty. Satisfactory
performance is shown from the numerical simulations.
I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, global warming effect and petrochemical
pollution has already caused seriously damage on the earth’s
environment, and has become a necessary problem to be
solved. How to improve the efficiency of wind and solar
energy generation systems becomes interesting research top-
ics. In recent literatures, the maximum power point tracking
methods of wind energy conservation systems (WECS) can
be roughly classified into: (i) perturb & observe method
[1]-[3]; (ii) neural network method [4], [5]; and (iii) fuzzy
methods [6]-[8]. Although the perturb & observe method
provides a simple and fast algorithm for searching the
maximum power point, the duty of converter rapidly perturbs
and causes energy loss near the maximum power point.
On the other hand, the neural network method is employed
to estimate the current wind speed from measured turbine
power and rotor speed, and thus decides the maximum power
point tracking command. In addition, the fuzzy methods are
applied to directly generate the control law by measuring
rotor speed of generator and DC-DC converter output volt-
age signal. Unfortunately, the above cited literatures focus
on developing maximum power operating point searching
algorithms but lack stability and performance analysis. To
remove the drawback, sliding mode control is applied for
maximum power tracking of WECS [9], [10]. Although the
sliding mode control design provides strong robustness to
parameter uncertainty and perturbation, the controller is very

measurement of the wind turbine speed and wind speed. The
speed sensorless control methods [11]-[13] are thus proposed
to achieve easier implementation. However, these sensorless
control methods are complex.
The T-S fuzzy model based control has been widely
investigated in literature [14]-[16]. The main advantage is
that the controller is realized by using parallel distributed
compensation (PDC) and a linear matrix inequality (LMI)
technique. However, the traditional fuzzy model based con-
trol cannot be easily extended to solve tracking or regulation
problems. Furthermore, the fuzzy PDC will be nontrivial
for affine nonlinear systems due to the existing bias at the
origin and external disturbances, such as DC-DC converters.
In other words, the T-S fuzzy model-based control cannot
be directly applied to wind energy generation systems. To
remove this drawback, the authors of [17] apply a coordinate
transformation to the converter for T-S fuzzy MPPT control
of solar PV generation systems. The main disadvantage is
that the operational point of the maximum power point
must be exactly known, in which the design will fail in the
implementation. Moreover, the approach cannot be directly
applied to wind energy generation systems. Therefore, all the
above points motivate this study.
This paper proposes a T-S fuzzy maximum power control
for the wind energy generation systems. To draw the maxi-
mum power from the wind turbine, a buck converter is ap-
plied to adjust the rectified output voltage of the permanent-
magnet synchronous generator (PMSG). In this paper, we
also explain that the wind generated power is maximized
by the output dc voltage of the PMSG. Then, according to
the maximum power voltage determined by the incremental
conductance method, the T-S fuzzy controller is developed
to achieve asymptotic MPPT. Furthermore, the robust LMI
gain design of the controller is also discussed in the presence
of the varying wind speed and system uncertainty. The
advantages of the proposed controller are: i) no calculation of
the maximum power operational point of the system; ii) no
coordinate transformation on the system; and iii) systematic
and strict stability analysis.
II. MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF WECS
The wind energy conservation system (WECS) is consti-
tuted by a fixed-pitch windmill, a multi-polar permanent-
magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), a rectifier, and a
DC-DC converter, as shown as Fig. 1. In order to improve
the efficiency of the wind turbine, we analyze the dynamic

978-1-4244-8126-2/10/$26.00 c©2010 IEEE 2238
where Ct(λ) = Cp(λ)/λ is the turbine torque coefficient.
The electrical torque Te of the generator is given as 3p4 φmiq.
From an observation on the dynamics (7)-(12), the PMSG
can be viewed as a current source to the converter and
provide the dc side current of the rectifier:
Idc =
π
2
√
3
√
i2q + i2d
In other words, the generated power Pe and rectified current
Idc can be adjusted by tuning the rectified voltage Vdc.
Therefore, the wind energy will be maximized by controlling
the value of Vdc.
III. T-S FUZZY MPPT CONTROLLER
A. Maximum Power Point Searching
From the above section, the wind power generation is
maximized by the rectified dc voltage Vdc. To determine
the maximum power point voltage Vdcr, we will use an
incremental conductance method for searching the maximum
power operational point. Consider the generated electrical
power (3) again and take the derivative with respect to Idc
as
dPe
dVdc
=
d(IdcVdc)
dVdc
= Idc + Vdc
dIdc
dVdc
(14)
When the condition dPedVdc = 0 is satisfied, i.e.,
dIdc
dVdc
= − IdcVdc ,
the system operates in the maximum power point. In other
words, the current operational region is determined from
whether dIdcdVdc > − IdcVdc or dIdcdVdc < − IdcVdc . If dIdcdVdc > − IdcVdc ,
then the dc voltage Vdc must increase (i.e., Vdcr = Vdcr+ΔV
with an update parameter ΔV ). In contrast, if dIdcdVdc < − IdcVdc ,
then the dc voltage Vdc must decrease (i.e., Vdcr = Vdcr −
ΔV ). According to these schemes, the maximum power point
searching algorithm is given as an incremental conductance
method [18]. After iterative adjusting the value of Vdcr, the
maximum power condition is achieved by dPedVdc ' 0. Thus,
the problem is changed to drive the dc voltage Vdc to follow
Vdcr.
B. T-S Fuzzy Controller
To achieve the wind energy maximum power point track-
ing (MPPT) control, we have to drive the dc voltage Vdc to
follow the maximum power point voltage Vdcr. First, due to
the fact that the PMSG is viewed as a current source, only the
dynamics of the buck converter is considered and expressed
in T-S fuzzy rules. According to the expression (10)-(12)
and the fuzzy modeling method [14], the buck converter is
described by the following T-S fuzzy rules:
Rule i : IF z1(t) is F1i and · · · and z4(t) is F4i THEN
x˙(t) = Aix(t) + Biu(t) + B0bd
i = 1, 2, · · · ,m, (15)
where x = [ Vdc iL vb ]T ; u(t) = d(t); the premise vari-
ables are selected as z1 = 1− io/iL, z2 = iL, z3 = Idc/Vdc,
z4 = Vdc; Fji (j = 1, 2, · · · , 4) are the fuzzy sets; m is the
number of fuzzy rules; and Ai, Bi, B0, bd are appropriate
subsystem matrices. By using the singleton fuzzifier, product
fuzzy inference and weighted average defuzzifier, the inferred
output of the fuzzy system is
x˙(t) =
m∑
i=1
μi(z(t)) {Aix(t) + Biu(t) + B0bd} (16)
where z(t) = [z1(t) z2(t) · · · z4(t)]T ; μi(z(t)) =
wi(z(t))/
∑m
i=1 wi(z(t)) ≥ 0 with wi(z(t)) =∏4
j=1 Fji(zj(t)) so that
∑m
i=1 μi(z(t)) = 1 for all t.
Here the matrices Ai, Bi, B0, bd and fuzzy sets Fji are
properly chosen such that the system (16) is equivalent to
the buck converter (10)-(12).
Next, let us define an integrator below:
e˙(t) = Vdcr − Vdc(t)
where e(t) ∈ R is an integral state variable. In turn, the
augmented system is expressed in terms of a new coordinate
ξ(t) = [ xT (t) e(t) ]T as
ξ˙(t) =
m∑
i=1
μi(z(t))
{
ACiξ(t) + Beiu(t) + B¯0b¯d
} (17)
where B¯0 = [ BTp BTy ]T with Bp = [ B0 0 ] and By =
[ 0 1 ]; b¯d = [ bd Vdcr ]T ; and
ACi =
[
Ai 0
−C 0
]
, Bei =
[
Bi
0
]
, C =
[
1 0 0
]
.
Then, from the above dynamic equation (17), the T-S fuzzy
MPPT controller is set to:
Controller Rule i :
IF z1(t) is F1i and · · · and z4(t) is F4i THEN
u(t) = K1ix(t) + K2ie(t), i = 1, 2, · · · ,m (18)
where K1i and K2i are controller gains. The fuzzy inferred
controller is obtained below:
e˙(t) = Vdcr − Cx(t)
u(t) =
m∑
i=1
μi(z(t)) {K1ix(t) + K2ie(t)} (19)
By applying the controller (19) to the system (17), the overall
controlled system is written in the form:
ξ˙(t) =
m∑
i=1
m∑
j=1
μi(z(t))μj(z(t))
{
Aijξ(t) + B¯0b¯d
} (20)
where Aij = ACi + BeiKj; and Kj = [ K1j K2j ].
Now, the main result is stated in the following theorem.
Theorem 1. Consider the wind energy conservation system
(7)-(12) driving by the wind power (1). By using the T-S
fuzzy MPPT control law (19), the maximum power voltage
Vdcr is achieved if the controller gains are set to Ki =

for zero-state response. Therefore, the residual error bound
of the maximum power voltage is proportional to the inverse

guaranteed. 
IV. NUMERICAL SIMULATION
To verify the theoretical derivations, we carry out the fuzzy
MPPT control for a WECS. Here we use a direct driving
PMSG WECS, which specification is stated below:
i) PMSG: a) maximum power 500W; b) Rs = 1.23Ω; c)
Ls = 0.78mH ; d) p = 6; e) φm = 0.31 flux.
ii) Wind turbine: a) limited wind speed v = 10m/s; b)
r = 1.28 m; c) J = 1.29 kg.m2; d) power coefficient
Cp(λ) = 78(9.47/λ− 1)exp(−30/λ);
e) Cpm = 0.38.
The buck converter is composed of an IRFP460 Power
MOSFET, 200μH storage inductance, 1000μF capacitance
Ca and Cb, and a power rectifier diode MBR2045CT. The
internal resistance RL of inductance L is 0.05Ω, respectively.
The forward voltage of the power rectifier diode is VD =

According to the fuzzy modeling (15) and setting the con-
trol parameters: ρ = 1.1, and Q1 = diag{0.5, 0.1, 0.4, 5},
the LMIs (26) in Theorem 2 are solved. Feasible controller
gains are found, and some gains are stated below:
K1 = [ 1.14 −0.0008 −0.0034 −127.9 ],
K16 = [ −7.35 0.013 −0.0056 808.78 ].
First, we consider an ideal cases with a fixed wind speed
5 m/sec. Assume that the output load current io = 12vb.
The disturbance ω(t) is assumed to be a random wave
with amplitude 0.5 due to electrical noise. By applying the
proposed control method, the power and voltage regulation
responses for the wind speed 5 m/sec is shown in Fig. 3,
while the stator currents, the inductance current, the load
voltage, the electrical angular speed, and the control signal
are illustrated in Figs. 4-6.
Next, consider the case with a various wind speed, where
the wind speed is assumed as shown in Fig. 7 (a). By
