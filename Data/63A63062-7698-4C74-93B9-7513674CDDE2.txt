摘要 
在製備ZnO 薄膜的研究多年來受到重視，研究p型ZnO薄膜大多是利用 N 原子及P 原子來參
雜，但是，單一的 N 原子或 P 原子摻雜會大幅度提高晶格能量，不利於材料的應用。因此有人同
時摻雜一個 Ga(或 Al 或In)及兩個 N，來製作 p 型 ZnO。如此摻雜所提升的晶格能較單一N 或 P 
的摻雜小，結構亦較穩定。學術界成長CN 薄膜則有多年的研究，對於利用碳原子來穩定氮原子的研
究尚未見到。本計畫在利用RF 磁控濺鍍沉積ZnO薄膜，研究碳原子的摻雜對ZnO薄膜中N原子穩定
的作用為何。實驗結果顯示，只有以N2的氣體來源時其繞射峰的半高寬較寬，其原因可能是晶格應變
太大及其結晶性不佳所造成；此時Ar的添加可以有效地增加薄膜的結晶性，其半高寬會略為變窄，可
見氮原子造成的應變是相當大的。而CH4氣體的加入，所得薄膜的半高寬即大幅下降，可見碳原子的
摻雜，可以有效地降低氧化鋅晶格因氮原子摻雜所造成的應變。

一、研究背景： 
ZnO 其晶體結構為六方纖鋅結構(wurtzite)，是II-VI族的化合物半導體，它的能隙寬度可達3.35 
eV，對於可見光具有很高的透明度，很適合用於製備高透明的TFT，同時ZnO 材料無毒且原料價格
便宜，化學穩定性高，可以在低溫以多種方法進行大面積成長，像磁控濺鍍法、RF 磁控濺鍍法、分
子束磊晶法、溶膠凝膠法、有機化學氣相沉積法、電漿反應沉積法等等。 
此外，ZnO 也是優良的光電及壓電材料，可用於積體光學、壓敏電阻、表面聲波元件、氣體感
測器、也是潛在的UV 和藍光材料。隨著沉積技術的進，ZnO 的材料的結構性能不斷提高，多晶材
料甚至是單晶材料都已獲得，但一般Ⅱ-Ⅵ族透明導電膜的傳導形式是以電子(N-type)為主，在1992 
年Butkhuzi et al.發表文章證實純氧化鋅薄膜經熱處理後，具有微弱的P-type 特性產生；之後在2002 
年S.Tüzemen與Gang Xiong et al發表文章已證實能製造出P-type 的純氧化鋅薄膜。目前p 型半導體
電子材料的摻雜技術獲得重大突破，而且在降低本質電子濃度上也獲得進展，使得採用ZnO 可以得n 
通道與p 通道半導體元件，從而使運用ZnO 製備透明半導體元件和電路成為最熱門的課題；這也使
得ZnO 材料在透明材料中脫穎而出，成為製備透TFT及其他半導體元件的首選；理論上能夠用ZnO 
製備CMOS 電路，即能實現外部電路的積集，這是非晶矽TFT 所不能實現的。若外部電路可以積集，
可以減少AMLCD 的體積，減少互連線的數目，從而提高顯示器可靠性與穩定性。

平均穿透率為75%，而一片沒有覆蓋任何東西的玻璃其穿透率為92%，所以，ZnO TFT 上的薄膜使

Abstract 
Deposited at working pressure ranging from 1×10-5 to 1×10-3 Torr, the yttria-stabilized 
zirconia, YSZ, thin film had been prepared by E-beam evaporation at substrate 
temperature of 200 °C. The XRD, TEM, SEM and UV-Vis were respectively used to 
determine the structure, microstructure, morphology and transmittance of YSZ thin 
films. Results show that the YSZ thin film with fluorite phase was obtained and XRD 
reflection peaks of (111), (200), (220), (311), (222) and (400) were found. The 
preferred orientation of [200] was found when thin films prepared at low working 
pressures, however, the [111] was at high pressure. The grain size and internal strain 
of YSZ films both decrease with working pressure increasing. After 1200 °C sintering, 
the nano-grained morphology was obtained.

deposition of components, thus leading to continuous film formation. 
The texture of YSZ film strongly depended on the deposition conditions during 
the nucleation step [16]. The neutralizer effect on the crystal orientation had been 
reported by Suh et al. [8]. For PLD process, the partial pressure effect had been 
studied by Chow and Wang [12] indicating that interlayer formation depended on 
working pressure. For E−beam evaporation, although the effect of Y content on the 
growth characteristics and structural characteristics of YSZ prepared at 200 °C had 
been reported by Wu et al. [7] and Hartmanova et al. [17], the effect of working 
pressure on growth characteristics was not studied in detail. In this study, the pressure 
dependent structure, morphology and transmittance were investigated.   
 
Experimental 
YSZ (TZ-8Y, 99.9%, TOSOH, Japan) powder, was chosen to be the source 
material for E-beam evaporation, which was formed a specific cylinder and sintered at 
1400 °C for 4 h. The silicon (100) substrate was cleaned in isopropyl alcohol (EPA) 
and deionized water, and dried by nitrogen gas blow. A diffusion-pumped vacuum 
system with a base pressure of 5×10-6 Torr was used for process. Oxygen was 
introduced into the chamber to adjust the working pressure ranging from 1×10-5 to 
1×10-3 Torr. For deposition, substrates were fastened in a curved holder with a 
working distance of 20 cm and heated by irradiation at 200 °C. The deposition rate of 
YSZ was controlled by an E-beam power and monitored by a thickness control system 
(CRTM-6000, ULVAC, Japan). Finally, a YSZ thin film with a thickness of about 500 
nm were obtained. For result analysis, the structure of YSZ films were identified by 
XRD with Cu Kα radiation and a Ni filter, operated at 30 kV, 30 mA, a scanning rate 
of 4 °/min and 2θ of 20°–80° (MAX 2500, RIGAKU, Japan). The morphology of the

the highest TC value at low working pressures. It means that the YSZ thin film 
possessed preferred orientation when deposited under low working pressure, however 
no obvious preferred orientation was observed when working pressure was higher 
than 5×10-3 Torr. Hartmanova et al. [19] had pointed out that polycrystalline YSZ 
prepared by E-beam evaporation at 200 °C and no tendency to a preferred texture was 
observed. Theses results demonstrate that the deposition parameter, namely oxygen 
pressure, plays an important role in YSZ texture formation, which might induced in 
the nucleation stage. According to atomic model, the YSZ thin film with cubic phase 
is more stable and (200) is preferred growing orientation on Si (100). It agrees with 
the report of Wu et al. [7] who pointed out the maximum diffraction peak is in crystal 
plane (200) for YSZ thin film with 7 mol% Y2O3 deposited at 350 °C. Meanwhile, the 
TC value of (111) is also high depending on oxygen pressure. Park et al. [16] reported 
that YSZ deposited on various Ni substrates resulting in the films with either mixture 
of (111) and (002) or mostly (111). Hata et al. [20] prepared YSZ on Si (100), (110) 
and (111) substrates by RF sputtering and concluded that YSZ orientation is properly 
controlled by substrate surface in the case of Si (100) and (111). Hata et al. [20] also 
showed a lattice model to demonstrate that the YSZ (200) is dominating on Si (100) 
substrate.   
Internal stress always induced in thin films deposition, which might mislead in 
determining lattice parameter from one reflection when a coating was under stress. 
The Nelson–Riley function, as shown in Eq. 2, could be utilized to determine the 
lattice constant minimizing the affect of stress [21]

The morphology of YSZ films prepared at various working pressures is shown in 
Fig. 5 revealing the smooth surface was obtained at low pressure. The higher working 
pressures the frequent collision of vapor species. The vapor species loss mobile 
energy before reaching substrate because of collision, thus, preventing these species 
from migrating to more energetic sites where grain growth can occur. Therefore, 
rougher surface was obtained as shown in Fig. 5(c).   
The morphology of YSZ thin films sintered at temperature of 1150, 1200 and 
1250 °C is shown in Fig. 6. In Fig. 6(a), it is found that the thin film cracked because 
of surface energy reduction resulting in the grain formed. Sintered at temperature of 
1200 °C, the isolated grain with a size of about 100 nm was found as shown in Fig. 
6(b). Sintered at temperature of 1250 °C, the abnormal growth was found and a coarse 
grain formed.  
 
Conclusions 
The effect of working pressure, namely oxygen pressure, on structure of YSZ 
films deposited onto Si (100) substrate by E−beam evaporation had been investigated. 
The YSZ thin film with preferred orientation of (200) was obtained when prepared 
under low working pressures, however no tendency to a preferred orientation was 
observed under high working pressure. Although the surface energy of YSZ (111) is 
lower than (200) and (220), the lattice model showed that YSZ (200) is dominating to 
grow on Si (100), which had demonstrated in this study. A minimum lattice constant 
of 5.144 Å was obtained at 1×10-4 Torr. The grain size and lattice strain both 
decreased with increasing working pressure and an inverse proportional relationship is 
found. After 1200 °C sintering, the nano-grained morphology was obtained.

Introduction 
Yttria−stabilized zirconia, YSZ, is a interest material which has wildly been used 
as an electrolyte in solid oxide fuel cell stack for power generation application [1]. 
The YSZ thin film prepared onto Si substrate has many potential applications, such as 
used as a buffer layer for epitaxial growth of oxide electrode [2,3], superconductors [4] 
and capacitors [5], etc. Because current semiconductor and integrated device 
technologies heavily rely on Si process technology, it is of interest to integrate those 
oxide heterostructures on Si substrate. For deposition of YBa2Cu3O7 or YBCO onto Si 
substrate, a YSZ thin film was used as a buffer layer, which could prevent the 
diffusion of Si from substrate and to offer a better-matched lattice for YBCO thin film 
growth [6].  
YSZ thin films may be prepared by a variety of processing techniques, such as, 
E−beam evaporation [6,7], ion−beam sputtering [8], RF sputtering [9], electrophoretic 
deposition (EPD) [1,10], electrostatic spray deposition (ESD) [11], pulsed laser 
deposition (PLD) [12], atomic layer deposition [13], screen printing [14], metal 
organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) [15], etc. Significantly, E-beam 
evaporation offers two major advantages: (1) a high power density, and hence a wide 
range of control over evaporation rates, from very low to very high and (2) the source 
material for evaporation being contained in the water-cooled crucible and its surface 
area showing a high temperature. Metallurgical reactions between crucible and source 
materials leading to film contamination are therefore minimized. Moreover, E-beam 
evaporation represents a viable fabrication technique in that it is based on a molecular

YSZ films was observed by SEM (S4800, HITACHI, Japan). The microstructure of 
the YSZ films was analyzed by TEM (Tecnai G2, FEI, Netherlands, Czech). 
Transmittance of thin films was measured by using UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer 
(HP-8453E, Agilent Technologies, USA).  
 
Results and Discussion 
The structure of YSZ prepared at various working pressures were analyzed by 
XRD and shown in Fig. 1, in which the reflections peaks of (111), (200), (220), and 
(311) of YSZ are found meaning that the crystalline YSZ possessing fluorite structure 
is obtained. In Fig. 1, the growth and decline of intensity of reflection peaks heavily 
depends on pressure indicating the working pressure plays an important role in 
nucleation and growth of YSZ on Si substrate. It suggested that (200) is dominating at 
low working pressure, while, (111) is dominating at high pressure. 
In Fig. 1, the intensity of the reflection of (111) obviously increased with 
working pressure increasing, while the inverse tendency is found for (200). Park et al. 
[16] pointed out that the growth orientation of the YSZ film strongly depended on the 
deposition condition used during the nucleation step, namely deposition parameters 
and substrate. Crystallographic texture of YSZ films was referred and texture 
coefficients (TC) were used to describe the texture of thin film with Eq. 1 [18].

reflections of YSZ were calculated and shown in Fig. 2 indicating the (200) possesses 
 7
straight line was obtained with the cos2θ/sinθ; so the following equation was used to 
obtain the lattice constant: 
a = a0 + a0 K' (cos2θ / sinθ). (3) 
The dependence of lattice constant of YSZ film on deposition temperature was shown 
in Fig. 3 revealing that the YSZ thin film possessing a minimum lattice constant when 
prepared under working pressure of 1×10-4 Torr. Lattice constant of YSZ deduced 
from XRD data and Eq. 3 is in the range of 5.144 to 5.211 Å. This minimum lattice 
constant closed to the value of 0.5137 nm reported by Gibson et al. [22], which is 
smaller than the reported value of YSZ deposited by PLD on Si substrate [12].    
The relationship between lattice strain (η) and FWHM (β) can be expressed as 
Eq. 4 [23]:   
d
1sin2cos += λ
θη
λ
θβ
. (4)  
Where θ is a Bragg’s angle, λ is wavelength of X-ray and d is crystallite size. For a 
XRD profile with more than 2 diffraction peaks, the 2η and 1/d could be separately 
obtained by calculating slope and intercept of profile of sinθ/λ versus β cosθ/λ . Fig. 4 
shows the dependence of grain size and strain on working pressure estimated 
according to Eq. 4. The grain size decreased with increasing working pressure and an 
inverse proportional relationship was found. It suggests that higher working pressure 
should hinder grain growth because higher working pressure results in more frequent 
collision and mobile energy reduction of vapor species preventing grain from growth. 
On the other hand, the similar tendency for relationship of lattice strain and working 
pressure was found as seen in Fig. 4. It deduced that the strain accumulation 
decreased with working pressure increasing and it should be proportional to grain
