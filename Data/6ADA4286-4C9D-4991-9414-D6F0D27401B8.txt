2Abstract
A novel processing technology is developed to modify brown rice in a more selective way with the help
of low-pressure plasma. The microstructure of the brown rice surface and the cooking, textural and
iodine-staining properties of plasma treated brown rice are determined. The plasma treatment results in an
etching of brown rice surface, which allows water to be easily absorbed by the rice kernel during soaking.
After plasma treatment, the cooking time of brown rice is reduced, and the cooked brown rice has a soft
texture and is easier to chew. In addition, the increment of the iodine-stained area indicates that the kernel
structure of brown rice is substantially affected by plasma. Thus, plasma treatment can be used to improve the
cooking properties and the quality of brown rice.
KEYWORDS
Brown rice, Plasma, Physicochemical
Introduction
Rice (Oryza Sativa L.) is one of the commonly cereal grains. It ranks as the most widely grown food
grain crop and servesas the staple food for almost half of the world’s population. Brown rice, which is huled 
directly from rough rice, consists of a bran layer (6-7% of its total weight), embryo (2-3%) and endosperm
(about 90%) (Chen, Siebenmorgen & Griffin, 1998). It contains more nutritional components, such as proteins,
lipids, dietary fibers, vitamins and minerals, than white rice (Chen et al., 1998; Lamberts et al., 2007). These
nutrients exist mainly in the germ and bran layers of the rice grains, but the germ and bran layers are almost
removed during the milling process from brown rice to white rice, which is primarily consumed.
Brown rice is less desirable due to its poor cooking and eating qualities (Das, Banerjee & Bal, 2008a;
Piggott, Morrison & Clyne, 1991). Cooked brown rice is dark in appearance and unpalatable with its hard
texture and chewiness which are attributed to the tough fibrous bran layer (Das et al., 2008a). However, from
the point of health, brown rice should be the preferred eating type because of its higher nutritional value.
Commercially, partial milling has been used for producing quick-cooking brown rice, but this lowers its
nutrients and integrity as the rice bran is partially removed (Cui, Pan, Yue, Atungulu & Berrios, 2010). There
are several reports have been studied or developed to reduce the cooking time of brown rice, such as heat-cool
treatment, pre-gelatinization, germination, enzymatic treatment and ultrasonic treatment (Afif, Jau & Eugene,
1992; Cui et al., 2010; Das et al., 2008a; Das, Gupta, Kapoor, Banerjee & Bal, 2008b; Hirokawa, Kumagai,
Oki & Sasaki, 1986; Ito & Ishikawa, 2004). However, these treatments still failed to resolve the disadvantages
of low quality appearance, undesirable texture and taste, unpleasant odors, and the complicated processes (Cui
et al., 2010). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a novel processing technology to modify the
surface of brown rice in order to improve the cooking quality of brown rice with high quality.
Recently, plasma-processing procedures using glow discharges for sterilization, deposition and etching of
thin films, increasing the surface energy of materials. Other applications have been conducted at pressures
4water in a boiling water bath. The cooking time was determined by removing a few kernels at different time
intervals during cooking and pressing them between two glass plates until no white core was left.
5.2. Elongation ratio: Cumulative length of 10 cooked rice kernels was divided by length of 10 uncooked raw
kernels and the result was reported as elongation ratio.
5.3. Width expansion ratio: Cumulative width of 10 cooked rice kernels was divided by width of 10 uncooked
raw kernels and the result was reported as width expansion ratio.
5.4. Water uptake ratio: Rice samples (2 g) were cooked in 20 ml distilled water for a minimum cooking time
in a boiling water bath. The contents were drained and the superficial water on the cooked rice was sucked by
pressing the cooked samples in the filter paper sheets. The cooked samples were then weighed accurately and
the water uptake ratio was calculated.
5.5. Cooking loss: Rice samples (2 g) in 20 ml distilled water were cooked for minimum cooking time in a
boiling water bath. The gruel were transferred to 50 ml beakers with several washings and made to volume
with distilled water. The aliquot having leached solids was evaporated at 110 ℃ in an oven until completely
dry. The solids were weighed and percent gruel solids were reported.
6. Density
6.1. Bulk Density (Grams per Milliliter). The volume of 100 g of rice (ml) was determined by gently pouring
the grain into a 250-ml graduated cylinder for obtaining the bulk density.
6.2. Density (Grams per Milliliter). The kerosene oil displacement procedure was employed.
7. Textural properties
Texture profile analysis (TPA) of cooked rice was performed using a texture analyzer (EZ Test-500N,
Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) with a two-cycle compression. A 10-mm radius probe was used to compress a pair of
grains with test speed of 5cm /min. The deformation ratio was set at 50%. Hardness, adhesiveness, brittleness,
cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness and elasticity were determined from the two-cycle curves. Fifteen pairs of
grains were measured for each sample.
8. Cross-sections of brown rice stained with iodine solution and its color measurement
Cooked brown rice grains were dissected and incubated in iodine solution (2 g KI and 1 g I2 per 300 ml)
for 30 min and subsequently washed in distilled water for 30 s. Photographs were taken from freshly stained
samples.
After lyophilization, the dried iodine-stained brown rice was ground into flours with a cyclone sample
mill (Udy Corp., Boulder, Co) and passed through a 100-mesh sieve. Color measurements were made on rice
flour in triplicate by using a Luci 100 color difference meter (Dr. Bruno Lange GmbH, Berlin, Germany)
calibrated with a white standard (Y = 94.0; x = 0.3141; y = 0.321). The L, a, and b readings were recorded and
white index (WI) was calculated according to the equation:
WI = 100−[(100−L)2+ a2+ b2]1/2
9. Statistical analysis
Analysis of variance and the significance of differences among samples were analyzed with the ANOVA
procedure and Duncan’s multiple range test of SAS for Windows R 8.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC),
respectively.
6(Das et al., 2008a). However, the width expansion was not influenced significantly when the rice was treated
with plasma. Therefore, plasma treatment promoted lengthwise swelling in brown rice during cooking.
Plasma treatment barely influenced the water absorption and cooking loss of brown rice after cooking in
excess water (Table 1). Thus, plasma treatment did not appear to cause the degradation of the rice-grain
structure that allows the release of components such as starch and proteins and increase of starch solubility.
The density of cooked rice was found to decrease from 1.219 without plasma treatment to 1.016 with
3kV plasma treatment. However, the bulk density showed a reverse tendency of 0.697 to 0.789 (Table 1). The
decrease in the density of cooked rice with increased kV indicated that the increase in expansion volume was
also improved by the increase in elongation.
4. Textural properties of cooked brown rice
The texture of cooked rice texture has been shown to govern its acceptance by consumers when it is
consumed as a whole grain. Hardness and adhesiveness, which are important parameters for the evaluation of
cooked rice texture, were measured (Ghasemi, Mosavian & Khodaparast, 2009). The results showed that the
hardness values of brown rice with plasma treatment were significantly lower than for untreated rice. Also,
adhesiveness values were significantly increased in the treated samples (Table 1). The milling treatment also
showed a similar effect on the textural properties of cooked rice (PARK, KIM & KIM, 2001). In addition,
gumminess and chewiness were lower with plasma treatment. Germination also makes brown rice softer and
easier to chew (Ito et al., 2004).
5. Cross-sections of brown rice stained with iodine solution and its color measurement
Iodine-stained cross-sections of cooked rice grains revealed the significant differences between brown
rice with and without plasma treatment. The blue staining of brown rice without plasma treatment only
appeared in the center of endosperm. The region of blue staining increased with the increasing kV of the
plasma treatment (Fig. 4). Meanwhile, significant decreases in brightness (L) and yellow value (b) of the
iodine-stained cooked brown rice flours were observed with the progressive increase in kV of plasma. There
was a reverse tendency in redness, a (Table 2). In addition, the WI values of iodine-stained cooked brown rice
flours were significantly decreased with the increasing kV of plasma. Overall, plasma treatment resulted in a
loose structure of cooked brown rice, which increased the quantity of the iodine-stained area, and thereby
decrease the white index of iodine-stained rice.
Conclusion
This research has shown that plasma treatment effectively improved the cooking properties of brown rice
by reducing cooking time and increasing elongation. In addition, the change in the morphological structure of
the rice bran layers and the increment in the quantity of the iodine-stained area demonstrated the effectiveness
of plasma treatment on the modification of brown rice. The properties of the plasma-treated brown rice were
also evaluated. It was determined that the utilization of low-pressure plasma, a novel technology in whole
grain processing, not only maintained the high nutritional values of brown rice, but also provided a better
textural quality and shortened the cooking time.

二、 與會心得 
全穀的保健意識持續受到全世界的重視，故帶動全穀新產品的活絡。烘焙及穀類產品佔全穀市場
的 60%，以早餐穀類食品為最多，其次為麵包產品、餅乾、穀物條。起初全穀類的保健宣稱常著重於
心臟健康方面，目前也增加許多定位，如 beta-glucan 及膳食纖維等等。 
吾人將此次研討會中針對穀類與健康之相關資訊簡述如下幾點： 
一、目前穀類產品之趨勢 
1、Numbering & Naming All The Grains：儘可能結合多種穀物對平常全穀主張做顯著之區分。 
2、Five is the magic number：5 種穀物是最常使用的。 
3、Making Indulgent Products More Healthy：讓消費者食用多穀物產品時可以不用忌口。 
4、Marketing Messages Are Taste Driven：市場是以口感為導向。 
5、Wholegrain Choices Have Expanded Rapidly 
6、More Health Benefits With Omega-3 Via Flax：許多產品利用亞麻種子的添加以提供 Omega-3。
