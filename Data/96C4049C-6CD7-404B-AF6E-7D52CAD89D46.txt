The PFO sample used here was purchased from 
American Dye Source, Quebec, Canada (cat. no. 
ADS129BE). The weight-average molecular mass 
(Mw) was 65 kDa and polydispersity index PDI = 2.6 
as determined via GPC using polystyrene standards. 
Since small-angle light scattering results of Grell et 
al.10 suggested a correction factor of (2.7)-1 = 0.37, 
the true Mw value is estimated to be 24 kDa. 
Real-time small- and wide-angle X-ray 
scattering (SWAXS) measurements on a 
liquid-nitrogen-quenched (from nematic melt state) 
PFO specimen at a heating rate of 10 oC/min were 
performed at the BL17B3 beamline of the National 
Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC)11. 
The sample was inserted between Kapton films, 
sealed with Al pan/cap (with circular holes 4 mm in 
diameter punctured at the center to allow for 
incidence of the X-ray beam) for good thermal 
contact, and placed in a Mettler Toledo FP84 DSC 
cell, which serves as a temperature-programmed 
specimen holder with an circular opening 2 mm in 
diameter allowing the X-ray beam to pass through. 
The incident beam (0.5 mm in diameter) was 
monochromated to 8 keV (wavelength λ= 1.55 Å) by 
use of a Si (111) double-crystal monochromator and 
collimated by a set of slits and two sets of Ta 
pinholes. With a sample-to-detector distance of 
2715.7 mm and a beam stop of 6 mm diameter, we 
collected SAXS data using a 2-D multiwire 
proportional counter. All the SAXS data were 
corrected for sample transmission, background, and 
detector sensitivity. The scattering vector, q≡4πλ-1 
sin(θ/2) where θ is the scattering angle, was 
calibrated by use of silver behenate. A polyethylene 
standard was used for the calibration of the absolute 
intensity I(q). On the basis of a photon flux of 109 
photons s-1 at 8 keV, a minimum time resolution of 1 
min is required for data acquisition. 
 
Result and discussion 
Shown in Figure 1 are real-time SAXS profiles 
of an as-quenched PFO specimen upon heating at 10 
oC/min from the glassy state. The intensity in SAXS 
profiles remained unchanged below 75 oC; however, 
as the temperature exceeded 75 oC, the scattered 
intensity was significant increases with increasing 
temperature. The SAXS intensity profiles have been 
detailed described in the literature12.  
To extract detailed structural information, we 
fitted the SAXS data after the subtraction of the 
SAXS from fractal-like density fluctuations (Figure 2) 
with a sphere, rod-like and ellipsoid form factor. As 
shown in Figure 3, we can adequately fit the two set 
of SAXS data measured below 95 oC with sphere 
diameter d = 3.7 and 3.8 nm using a sphere form 
factor. As the temperature increasing to 95 oC where 
in the corresponding WAXS profiles (green line in 
Figure 6) exhibits the starting crystalline reflections, 
the form factor starts to change, kind of growth as 
short-rod. Using the rod form factor, we can fit the 
SAXS data in the range of 95-135 oC reasonably 
(4~9 nm in length and 6~13 nm in radius), as shown 
in Figure 4.  
At temperatures above 135 oC (cf. Figure 5), the 
SAXS intensity profile can be fitted systematically at 
the absolute intensity scale using the ellipsoid model 
for the form factor. As a result, the two sets of data 
can be described adequately using the two common 
parameters fitted: a=6.1, 7.5 nm and b=14.9, 16.7 nm, 
respectively. 
Corresponding DSC thermograms of this 
as-quenched PFO specimen is shown in Figure 7. In 
the range of 75-105 oC, there exhibits a clear cold 
crystallization exotherm, which corresponds to the 
WAXS profiles show that crystalline structure starts 
to appear at 95 oC and well crystallized above 145 
oC.  
The structural parameters from the fit are 
summarized in Figure 8; moreover, the mean spacing 
of lamellar can be estimated by the location of the 
peak maximum Qc (L=2π/ Qc) in Figure 2. The long 
periods determined from the peak positions are in the 
range of 23.2 - 38.2 nm during subsequent heating 
from 95 to 145 oC. The derived amorphous 
thicknesses (la) at various temperatures were about 
19.6-23.7 nm, the la increases modestly with 
increasing temperature.                                       
Results during the subsequent heating can be 
divided into four stages of different characteristics. 
At temperatures below 75 oC, PFO is in glass state 
and the SAXS profiles show the fractal-like density 
fluctuations. For temperatures between 75 oC and 95 
oC, these polymer chains formed sphere-like clusters 
in which the nucleation mechanism gives birth to 
initial nanometer-sized nuclei (baby nuclei). 
Nanograins approximately 10 nm in size are in 
reasonable agreement with values obtained from the 
secondary electron images (SEIs) previously reported 
by Chen et al.12 Between 95 and 135 oC, the 
morphology of nanograins changes from sphere to 
rod-like shape and the cluster size grow with 
increasing temperature. Above 135 oC, the change in 
crystallite morphology from short rod to disk-like 
followed by a subsequent coalescence of nanograins.  
Consistent with SAXS results, SEI images in 
literature (Figure 4c-e)12 showed that the nodular 
features appear to become aligned into strings of 
nanograins with increasing tcc or Tcc. 
The result indicates that the crystallization 
process can be divided into three steps: (1) 
Nucleation, (2) Size Growth stage, and (3) 
Coalescence and growth stage. Hence, the initial 
structure of polymer crystallization might begin with 
the formation of nanodomain. A fundamentally 
important point is then the self-assembly process of 
these nanograins into larger features such as 
spherulites.

formation. Upon heat treatment, the nanodomains coalesce into string - or rod -like entities in which 
the conjugated backbones lie in-plane and orthogonal to the long axis. Similar morphological 
features have been generally observed for poly(9,9-dialkyl-2,7-fluorene)s (PFs)4-9 and regioregular 
poly(3-n-alkyl-2,5-thiophene)s (RRPTs),10,11 This inherent heterogeneity in the length scale of 10 
nm is expected to bear relevance to morphology-dependent properties, as supported by recent X-ray 
scattering studies of effects of heat treatment12 or externally applied electric field13 on charge carrier 
mobility in cast films of mesomorphic poly(2-methoxy-5-(2'-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene) 
(MEH-PPV).  
In contrast to the mesophorphic nature MEH-PPV, poly(9,9-di-n-octyl-2,7-fluorene) (PFO, 
chemical structure given as inset in Figure 2) exhibits well developed crystallinity6,7,9,14 and serves 
as an interesting model system for investigating effects of the inherently nano-scaled heterogeneity 
on the development of a hierarchy of supramolecular aggregation. Previous microscopic 
observations indicated that melt crystallization of PFO may result in not only single-crystals with 
lamellar thickness in the order of 10 nm (less than the contour length, suggesting folded chains) and 
lateral dimension in the order of 1 to 10 μm but also spherulites (with radius in the order of 10 μm) 
comprising crystalline fibrils extending radially from the sheaf-like core.6,9 These features, much 
similar to crystalline assemblies in conventional polymers, are indeed surprising in view of the rigid 
nature of the PFO backbone: conventional wisdom would dictate absence of chain folding and 
predict formation of fringed micelle crystals.15,16 The development of supramolecular assemblies 
such as lamellar single crystals and spherulites from the nanodomains is an interesting issue, for 
which we have previously6,9 postulated a mechanism of attachment and coalescence of 
nanodomains observed earlier for nanometer-sized ordered grains17-20 of metal oxides and 
surfactant-mediated silicate.21 To verify this model, we would need morphological evidences 
independent of previous observations for PFO melt crystallized at an elevated temperature Tc, 
where nucleation is slow due to limited supercooling.  
One natural approach is to examine morphological development during “cold crystallization,” 
 
4
(equipped with a copper target for Kα-line of wavelength 0.154 nm, polycapillary collimator/lens, 
and parabolic multi-layer mirrors) was used under a step-scan rate of 0.05o per 5 sec in the 
scattering angle range of 3o to 37o. Full-range calibration of the scattering angle was made using 
both silicon and silver behenate standards.  
Films were drop-cast from dilute (ca. 0.1 w/v%) solutions of PFO in toluene on inclined glass 
substrates. The as-cast films were routinely heat-treated via a brief 1-min residence at 200 oC or 
above (equilibrium melting temperature of PFO is recently determined as Tmo ≈ 180 oC)23 to 
eliminate previous processing history, followed by quenching into ice water to obtain films of 
nematic glass. The nematic films were then “cold-crystallized” by rapidly heated to and maintained 
at an elevated temperature (Tcc, in the range of 140 to 150 oC) significantly above its glass transition 
temperature (Tg) but below the melting temperature (Tm) for different periods of time (tcc, up to 26 
h). Due to preferred nucleation of the α crystalline phase4,5 at low temperatures, this cold 
crystallization procedure always results in dominance of α crystals. All heat treatments were made 
by use of a Linkman THMS-600 high-temperature stage (connected to a TMS-91 temperature 
controller) under protective nitrogen atmosphere. TEM specimens were detached from the glass 
substrate using a dilute HF solution. These specimens were then vapor-deposited with carbon prior 
to TEM examinations. 
For comparison with microscopic and diffraction results, differential scanning calorimetric 
(DSC) measurements over specimens of the same thermal history were taken by use of a Perkin- 
Elmer Diamond instrument (routinely calibrated using indium standard) at a heating rate of 10 
oC/min under a stream of nitrogen atmosphere. Real-time small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) 
measurements on a liquid-nitrogen-quenched (from nematic melt state) PFO specimen at a heating 
rate of 10 oC/min were performed at the BL17B3 beamline of the National Synchrotron Radiation 
Research Center (NSRRC). The sample was inserted between Kapton films, sealed with Al pan/cap 
(with circular holes 4-mm in diameter punctured at the center to allow for incidence of the X-ray 
beam) for good thermal contact, and placed in a Mettler Toledo FP84 DSC cell, which serves as a 
 
6
delineated below. 
Allowing for a short period (3 min) of cold crystallization at Tcc = 140 oC, significant increase 
in crystallinity was observed (curve b in Figure 1) and no cold crystallization endotherm in the low 
temperature range was observed. The melting endotherm resolved into 3 peaks, located respectively 
at Tm1 = 148 oC, Tm2 = 154 oC, and Tm3 =159 oC. Among them, Tm1 corresponds to initial melting of 
the cold-crystallized crystals and Tm3 to final melting of well-perfected crystals during heating. The 
origin of Tm2 is less clear but we tentatively attribute it to melting of reorganized crystals of 
moderate perfection (as compared to those of Tm3). In the case of highest Tcc of 150 oC, the 3 peaks 
merge into a single endotherm located at 158 oC (i.e., 8 oC above Tcc). In all cases, broad 
endothermic contributions below Tcc are attributable to minor crystallinity developed during 
quenching or reheating.   
More importantly, the total endothermic heat in the case of 3-min cold crystallization at 140 oC 
(curve b in Figure 1) corresponds to 23 J/g, which translates to ca. 30% crystallinity. Within this 
short period of 3 min, the crystallization process is largely complete, as further increases in tcc up to 
11 h resulted in insignificant changes in crystallinity and only slight increases of Tm1 to 149 oC 
(curves b to d). This efficient process of cold crystallization at an elevated temperature distant from 
Tg (such that the controlling factor of crystallization kinetics is nucleation rather than growth) 
justifies our interpretation that existing crystallites (formed during quenching, that are of small size 
and densely distributed in space) within the as-quenched specimens serve as nuclei for the 
subsequent cold crystallization process.  
In support of this scenario are real-time SAXS profiles (Figure 3) of an as-quenched PFO 
specimen upon heating at 10 oC from the glassy state, which corresponds to curve a in Figure 1 up 
to 145 oC. At temperatures below 70 oC (cf. Figure 2a), the SAXS intensity profile exhibited 
monotonic decay with increasing q and was insensitive to changes in temperature. Significant 
increases in intensity with increasing temperature was observed in the high-q region as the 
temperature reaches 80 oC, where the corresponding DSC trace (Curve a in Figure 1) exhibits the 
 
8
(hk0) reflections; lc values along the [200] direction (42 and 47 nm, respectively) remained largely 
comparable to the plateau value of Tcc = 140 oC, implying generally limited development of 
positional order along the crystallographic a-axis. In contrast, the lc value along the [220] direction 
increased from 39 to 62 nm in the two high-Tcc cases, suggesting continued positional ordering 
along the crystallographic b-axis that corresponds to the fibrillar axis in melt-crystallized PFO 
axialites or spherulites.9  
Nanograins in Cold-crystallized PFO. Although crystallized within the same temperature 
range adopted in previous melt crystallization studies where single crystals and axialites were 
observed, morphological features in the present case of cold crystallization are dramatically 
different. Given in Figure 4 are secondary electron images (SEIs) of the PFO thin films before and 
after cold crystallization. The as-quenched film is characterized by nodules ca 10 nm in size (Figure 
4a), embedded in a matrix of less prominent nanodomains. A crack extending from left to central 
regions of view is observed to propagate around (rather than passing through) the nodules, much 
like fractographic features in filled composites.24 This implies stress concentration and hence rigid 
nodules as compared to the soft matrix of nanodomains, which is consistent with our contention of 
existing nuclei in the as-quenched specimens. Upon cold crystallization (Figure 4b), the nodular 
features are more clearly identifiable, which appear to become aligned into strings of nanograins 
with increasing tcc or Tcc (Figure 4c-e).  
More direct evidences for nanograins to align themselves upon prolonged cold crystallization 
at an elevated temperature come from TEM observations. Consistent with SEM results, bright-field 
images (BFIs) given in Figure 5 indicate general presence of nanograins. More importantly, the 
corresponding selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (taken from central region of the 
view) changes from rings comprising identifiably discrete spots for short-term crystallized (Figure 
5a) to arcs of finite azimuthal spans in long-term crystallized (11 h, Figure 5b) specimens. Upon 
increases in crystallization temperature and time, the azimuthal spans of all reflection arcs decrease 
further, resulting in fiber-like patterns (Figure 5c,d). Note that the observed reflections (as indexed 
 
10
increasingly easier (as compared to translation) to be thermally activated as the particle size 
decreases to the nanometer length scale. The present case of long-term cold crystallization of PFO 
serves as an independent demonstration for feasibility of such a process; a relatively high Tcc for 
adequate thermal activation is understandably required.  
The observation of the tendency of the crystallographic c-axis to lie in-plane whereas a- and 
b-axes remain randomly oriented deserves further comments. We note that this is in contrast to the 
preferred in-plane alignment of b- and c-axes in axialites or spherulites developed during melt 
crystallization.9 It signifies the concurrent orientation adjustment of neighboring nanograins in 
different locations during cold crystallization; in melt crystallization, the attachment-coalescence 
process occurs only at the crystal growth front, resulting in more coherent orientation (and preferred 
growth) along the b-axis. This orientation process during isothermal cold crystallization cannot be 
attributable to Oswald ripening, as Oswald ripening involves growth of large particles at the 
expense of smaller particles through molecular migration/reorganization, which would result in 
changes in morphological features. Our electron micrographs indicate clear contrast for nanograins; 
their size remained little changed with time.  
Relevance to Melt Crystallization. Present results indicate rotation-attachment-coalescence 
of nanograins as the dominant mode of morphological development in cold crystallized PFO at the 
same temperature range of previous melt crystallization studies. We now concentrate on the issue 
that whether this process contributes significantly to the melt crystallization of PFO. We note first 
that, the melt crystallization temperature range of 140 to 150 oC in previous studies corresponds to 
supercoolings ∆T ≡ Tmo − Tc = 30 to 40 oC, which are significantly away from equilibrium as 
characteristic to melt crystallization of polymers in general. In contrast to the present case of cold 
crystallization of PFO where nanocrystallites are inherently dominating, the melt crystallization 
counterpart is characteristically low in the rate of primary nucleation such that single crystals, 
axialites and eventually spherulites are dominant supramolecular aggregates observed; however, 
nanometer-sized grainy features persist under high magnifications.6,9 Nanodomain features inherent 
 
12
some intermediate ordering either generally in the melt or specifically at the crystal front. By and 
large, in the forming is the view that enhanced primary nucleation at the growth front is likely an 
alternative route not accounted for by the classical Hoffman- Lauritzen kinetic model of polymer 
crystallization. Our observations of nanograin features of melt- and cold-crystallized PFO appears 
consistent with this line of thought. In Strobl’s model, an adsorbed layer of mesomorphic metastable 
phase at the crystal growth front is postulated.29 For the present case of PFO, the melt state is, by its 
nature, mesomorphic (or more specifically, nematic in terms of optical texture)8 and hence 
consistent with Strobl’s hypothesis. Nevertheless, for general polymers, it appears that the (purely 
geometric) wall effects from the approaching crystal growth front could be adequate to induce chain 
alignment and hence primary nucleation; the postulated presence of a separate phase of 
mesomorphic order in general awaits more thorough experimental confirmation.  
As a final remark, we note that an indirect evidence in support of the present model of 
morphological development in terms of Brownian rotation, oriented attachment and coalescence of 
nanograins comes from the observation of the comparatively short lifetime (in the order of a few 
seconds) for SAED patterns of melt- and cold-crystallized PFO specimens under electron beam. For 
conventional polymer crystals (such as polyethylene or syndiotactic polystyrene), the corresponding 
lifetime under similar operating conditions is typically an order of magnitude longer. This implies 
exceedingly high density of defects in PFO crystals, characteristic of aggregated nanocrystals after 
oriented attachment and coalescence.

Figure 3. Synchrotron radiation SAXS profiles obtained during heating of an as-quenched PFO 
specimen (a) upon heating at 10 oC/min from ambient to 145 oC and (b) during subsequent 
isothermal holding at 145 oC up to 10 min. Significant increases in scattering intensity in the high-q 
range was observed when heated above Tg (≈ 60 oC), showing onset of cold crystallization near 80 
oC that results in crystallites of small and broadly distributed size in the range of 10 to 25 nm. The 
initial stage of cold crystallization is largely completed near 120 oC; further increases in temperature 
result in increased intensity in the low-q region with concomitant decrease in intensity in the high-q 
range, signifying increased crystallite size up to ca. 35 nm with increasing temperature. Subsequent 
isothermal heat treatment at 145 oC resulted in little changes in the SAXS profile, indicating that the 
cold crystallization process is intrinsically rapid and the absence of discernible lamellar 
thickening/reorganization within this 10-min period of isothermal annealing.
