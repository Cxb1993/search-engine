The nonlinear model of the 2DOF 
helicopter includes the aerodynamic force 
and propeller dynamics. This plant is a 
multi-dimensional and nonlinear unstable 
model with two manipulated inputs and two 
measured outputs. Mc is the center of mass, R 
is the length of acrylic fuselage and Rc is the 
distance from pitch axis. The pitch propeller 
is actuated by DC motor whose speed is 
controlled by the way of input voltage vf. The 
revolving speed makes the propeller to 
generate the force acts the normally to the 
2DOF helicopter fuselage at a distance L 
from the pitch axis.  
The nonlinear dynamic equations of the 
2DOF helicopter are obtained

In this proposal, we use the 
Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model to design the 
nonlinear controller. This fuzzy modeling 
method can divide the nonlinear system into 
several linear subsystems and the overall 
fuzzy model of the system is performed as 
fuzzy intermix of the linear subsystems. The 
T-S fuzzy model is described the 
input-output relative of the local linear 
subsystems and is represented by fuzzy 
IF-THEN rules. The T-S fuzzy model is 
expressed as follows: 
Rule i: IF )(tzi  is L1iM and )(tzn  is inM

Using the parallel distributed 
compensation (PDC), we have the fuzzy 
control rules and the control closed-loop 
system can be written as

To demonstrate the effectives of fuzzy 
controller, a 2DOF experimental helicopter is 
used as the platform. The helicopter is made 
in Quanser Company of Canada [8]. The 
helicopter has two propellers driven by DC 
motors (front motor and back motor) in the 
plant and measures the longitudinal and 
lateral electrical signals through the slip ring 
on the base.  
There are two power modules to offer 
motor voltage in the system. The UPM2405 
is used for the pitch motor and the UPM1503 
is used for the yaw motor. The MultiQ-PCI 
data acquisition card installed on computer 
supports 48 I/O channels. The MultiQ-PCI 
terminal board supports 4 analog output, 16 
analog input, 6 encoder input, and 48 digital 
I/O channels. The MATLAB software 
installed on a computer commands the 
helicopter simulator. 
Figures 3 and 4 demonstrate the 
experimental responses for the robust flight 
test of 2DOF helicopter under matched 
external disturbance about 2.1805N in 
longitude and 1.05N in lateral during 40 to 
60 seconds. Obviously, the robust and 
robust-optimal conditions are works out in 
the robust design of 2DOF helicopter. The 
experimental results verify the performances 
of the proposed design.

五、成果自評 
 
The robust-optimal conditions are 
employed to design the nonlinear fuzzy 
controller. Those of the fuzzy controllers are 
applied to control the input voltages of two 
DC motors such that the attitudes of 2DOF 
experimental helicopter are tracked. The 
fuzzy controller regulates the longitudinal
