where n nA  represents a stable matrix, TA denotes the transpose of A, Q n n is a
given positive definite (semi-definite) matrix and matrix P is the unique positive definite
(semi-definite) solution of the CALE (1).
In the literature, many control problems that use the Lyapunov equation approach can be
treated by upper solution bounds [3, 6, 9, 10, 13, 18, 19]. But thus far, the exact solution of
the CALE (1) has not been among these. Gajic and Qureshi [4] explained one motive for
studying the solution bounds of the Lyapunov equation: sometimes we are simply interested
in the general behavior of the underlying system, and this behavior can be determined by
examining certain bounds on the parameters of the solution, rather than the full solution.
During the past few decades, research on developing solution bounds of the CALE (1) has
attracted considerable attraction, and many research approaches have been devoted to this
topic [2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 13-17]. Among those solution bounds, the matrix bounds are the most
general findings. In the literature, upper matrix bounds of the solution of the CALE have been
studied in [5, 7, 8, 14, 16]. However, it seems that all of these approaches contain points of
weakness. In following, we therefore derive upper matrix bounds of the solution of the CALE
(1) that do not have the mentioned drawbacks.
Utilizing linear algebraic techniques, we propose the following results.
Theorem 1. For the CALE (1), the solution P satisfies

[ ]ijA E e   and [ ]d d dijA E e   (19)
where E and dE are n n real matrices with all positive entries. If there exists a positive
constant  such that

then the unique positive solution P has the following upper matrix bound

Remark 1. Since A and dA represent n n uncertain matrices, it is obviously that the
Lyapunov equation (18) is unsolvable. However, we can obtain the upper solution bound (21).
Remark 2. It is seen that we can select the positive constant  as

3.2 ROBUST STABILITY OF INTERVAL TIME-DEALY SYSTEMS
It is well-known that interval matrices which are caused by unavoidable system parametric
variations, changes in operating conditions, aging, etc, are real matrices in which all entries
are known only to belong to a specified closed interval. Therefore, it is seen that the CALE (1)
is unsolvable when the system matrix A is an interval matrix. Furthermore, due to information
transmission between elements or systems, date computations, natural property of system
elements, etc, time delay(s) also inherently exits(s) in controlled systems and therefore must
be integrated into system models. Stability analysis for interval systems becomes more
complicated when these systems possess time delay(s). As mentioned in the above
descriptions, the upper bounds of the solution of the CALE (1) can be utilized to solve the
robust stability problem of time-delay systems. We then apply the obtained new upper matrix
bounds of the solution of the CALE (1) (i.e., Theorems 1 and 2) to discuss the stability
analysis problem for the interval time-delay systems.
Consider the following interval time-delay system
( ) ( ) ( )I Idx t A x t A x t d   (24)
where ( ) nx t  denotes the state, positive constant d is the delay, and [ ]I IijA a and
[ ]Id IdijA a are interval matrices with appropriate dimensions and the properties:
[ , ]IA N U V with [ ], [ ]ij ijU u V v  (25)
VI
( ) ( ) 0dA E A    . (36)
Remark 6. We can also apply the bound (3) to this research. However, the resulting condition
is somewhat complex. Therefore, we leave it to the readers who are interested in this topic.
Remark 7. It is seen that the condition (23) is a special case of the condition (20). In [1], it
has been shown that for any symmetric matrices , n nA B  ,
)()()(1 BABA ijji   (37)
where integers i and j satisfy nji  ,1 and 1 nji . Therefore, from (23), we have
  21 1 1( ) ( ) 2 ( )T T T T T Td d d d d d dA A A A A A A A I A A I A A I A I A I             . (38)
The condition (35) can be obtained directly by substituting (38) into (23). Therefore, (20) is
sharper than (35). If
22 22( )d d dA E A  , then (20) is also better than (36).
Comparison 2. If IA A and Id dA A where A and dA are constant matrices, then
system (24) becomes the following simple time-delay system.
( ) ( ) ( )dx t Ax t A x t d   (39)
Surveying the literature, a concise and well-known condition for testing the robust stability of
the time-delay system (39) is given in [11]. We rewrite it as follows.
( ) 0dA A   . (40)
From the proof of Theorem 4, the conditions (33) and (34) become the following condition:
1
0
2 ( ) 2 ( )

d dQ Q A QAA A


   (41)
Furthermore, both the conditions (35) and (36) now become (40). Therefore, it is seen that the
condition (40) is only a special case of (41). Therefore, criterion (41) is better.
The condition (20) now becomes
1
0T Td dA A I A A 
    (42)
Let ( )A  . Then using 0.5( ) ( )TA A A I  and 2Td d dA A A I , (41) implies
21( ) 0 ( ) 0
( ) d d

This means the obtained result (42) is sharper than that of [11].
Theorem 5. The time-delay system (39) is stable with a specified decay rate  if
 2( ( ) )( 2 ) 2 0T T dn d dA A A I A A e         (44)
or there exists some positive constant  such that the following condition is satisfied
