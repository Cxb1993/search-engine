Abstract 
Keywords: (1) Morison Equation  
(2) Square Cylinder   
(3) Numerical Simulation 
The unsteady forces on a square cylinder 
in sinusoidally oscillating flows with non-zero 
mean velocities are investigated numerically 
by using a weakly-compressible-flow method 
with three-dimensional large eddy simulations. 
The major parameters in the analysis are 
Keulegan-Carpenter number ( KC ) and the 
ratio between the amplitude and the mean 
velocities of the approaching flow ( RA ). By 
varying the values of KC  and RA , the 
resulting drag and lift of the cylinders are 
analyzed systematically at two selected 
approaching-flow attack angles (0° and 22.5°). 
In the case of the non-zero attack angle, 
results show that both the drag and lift 
histories can be adequately described by 
Morison equations. However, Morison 
equations fail to correctly describing the lift 
history as the attack angle is zero. In addition, 
when the ratio of KC/AR  is near the 
Strouhal number of the bluff-body flow, the 
resulting drag is promoted due to the 
occurrence of resonance. Based on the results 
of systematic analyses, finally, the mean and 
inertia force coefficients at the two selected 
attack angles are presented as functions of 
KC  and RA  based on the Morison 
relationships.

4.3 阻力係數與慣性阻力係數 
經整合系統化的數值模擬結果，圖七
與圖八顯示來流為零攻角時相應於方程式
(1)之阻力係數與慣性阻力係數變化。整體
而言，阻力係數由一小值隨著 KC 之增加
而增加(圖七)，並發生一極大值；此時之
KC/AR 值約略等於方柱在均勻流中之史特
赫數(Strouhal number)。 KC/AR 在物理上
之意義為來流無因次化之振盪頻率，當此
頻率與柱體渦散頻率對應時即產生共振，
因此造成阻力係數產生極值。爾後，繼續
隨著 KC 值之增加阻力係數則呈現下降之
趨勢，最終趨近於均勻流況之平均阻力係
數(2.04)。此外，當 RA 越大時，產生之極
值亦越大，此也顯示來流流速振盪之幅度
有增強此一現象之效應。 
在慣性阻力係數( DC
~ )之變化方面，由
圖八可明顯看出其趨勢與阻力係數( DC )之
不同。因為 DC
~ 乃與來流流場中之慣性力相
關，故不受共振之影響。因此，在 RA 固定
時，隨著在 KC 之增加(來流振盪週期增
加)，慣性阻力係數則產生下降趨勢，最終
趨近於零值，此時來流引致之慣性力則已
式微。 
圖九與圖十顯示於 22.5°來流攻角情況

振盪來流之特性有別於一般均勻流

期內產生加速及減速的現象。依據數值模
擬結果，圖十三顯示典型振盪流場中(θ = 
0°, RA = 0.5 and KC = 4)一個完整週期內
的渦散變化過程(渦度等值圖)。由於受到
流場加速度(慣性力)所產生之影響，流體
流經柱體時不似一般均勻流流況，在柱後
規律且對稱地交替產生卡門渦流(Karman

牽制。當流場在加速過程時時，渦流被拉
扯，並造成較細長的尾流區(wake)；另一
方面，當流場減速時，渦流則有被流場向
上游推擠的現象，尾流區也變寬。以此典
型情況為例，當KC 小且 RA 大時(此時來流
之非恆定度高)，渦流甚至會往上游移動，
在時變過程中甚至會造成負值阻力。研究
中亦見，計算之平均阻力係數( DC )為
2.272，大於均勻流況之值(2.046)。

SUMMARY
The unsteady forces on a square cylinder in sinusoidally oscillating flows with non-zero-mean velocities15
are investigated numerically by using a weakly compressible-flow method with three-dimensional large
eddy simulations. The major parameters in the analysis are Keulegan–Carpenter number (KC) and the17
ratio between the amplitude and the mean velocities of the approaching flow (AR). By varying the values
of KC and AR the resulting drag and lift of the cylinders are analyzed systematically at two selected19
approaching-flow attack angles (0 and 22.5◦). In the case of the non-zero attack angle, results show that
both the drag and lift histories can be adequately described by Morison equations. However, Morison21
equations fail to correctly describing the lift history as the attack angle is zero. In addition, when the
ratio of AR/KC is near the Strouhal number of the bluff-body flow, the resulting drag is promoted due23
to the occurrence of resonance. Based on the results of systematic analyses, finally, the mean and inertia
force coefficients at the two selected attack angles are presented as functions of KC and AR based on the25

FLUID FORCES ON A SQUARE CYLINDER IN OSCILLATING FLOWS 3
where U0 and Um are, respectively, the mean and amplitude speeds of the approaching flow; T is1
the oscillation period; A and D are, respectively, the cross-sectional area and width of the cylinder;
CD and CL denote the mean drag and lift coefficients; C˜D and C˜L represent the inertia coefficients3
of the unsteady drag and lift forces.
In the problem, an important parameter to describe the features of the sinusoidal approaching5
flow is the Keulegan–Carpenter number [2], defined as KC=UmT/D. It has been widely used by
researchers to characterize the variation pattern of the unsteady approaching flow.7
3. RELATED STUDIES
There are a number of studies regarding cylinders in an oscillating flow field. Most of them9
concentrated on problems with zero-mean approaching-flow velocities. In the cases of zero-mean
sinusoidal approaching flows, typically, Williamson [3] observed the motions of vortices around11
single circular cylinders and pairs of cylinders in a U-shape oscillating-flow tunnel. Together with
the force measurement results, the observed flow patterns within different ranges of KC were13
used to explain how the lift and drag were influenced by cylinder proximity and the extent of
approaching-flow unsteadiness. Sarpkaya [4] performed similar U-shape water tunnel experiments15
and the result of drag measurements on circular cylinders were used to check the validity of the
Stokes–Wang analysis. Okajima et al. [5] measured the forces on circular and square cylinders at17
a zero approaching-flow attack angle in a U-tube water tank with a wide range of KC variation
(1–90). Lam and Dai [6] applied PIV techniques to monitor the development of vortex structure of19
an oscillating circular cylinder in a water tank at low KC values. Zheng and Dalton [7] adopted a
numerical method to simulate oscillating flows past a square cylinder at low KC values (up to 5) at21
two attack angles (0 and 45◦) and compared the numerical predictions with the measurement results
from Bearman et al. [8]. Nomura et al. [9] measured the forces on a square cylinder impinged23
by an unsteady jet with non-zero-mean velocities at two attack angles (0 and 22.5◦). It was found
that the drag history could be explained by Morison equations. Since the instantaneous flow field25
was not measured in the study, its effect on the resulting drag history was not discussed in more
detail.27
4. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
In the study, a series of numerical simulations were conducted to explore the forces on a square29
cylinder in a periodically oscillating flow field. As shown in Figure 1, the problem of a sinusoidal
flow past a square cylinder with a non-zero-mean velocity at a high Reynolds number (Re=31
U0 D/), typically of 107, is investigated. Two typical attack angles (=0 and 22.5◦) are selected
in the analysis. By varying the KC value and the amplitude velocity ratio (AR =Um/U0), the33
resulting unsteady forces on the cylinder as well as the relationship between the forces and the
surrounding flow field are analyzed to gain additional insight into the analysis of related engineering35
problems.

Figure 2. Typical computational mesh (266×96grids).
Appropriate values of pressures and velocities are specified at exterior cells (or phantom cells)1
outside of the boundaries to reflect the physical nature of the boundaries. At the cylinder surface, a
no-slip condition is used. At the side boundaries, the pressures and velocities at the phantom cells3
are specified according to a zero-gradient assumption in the direction normal to the boundaries.
Similar zero-gradient boundary specifications are set at the span-wise end sections. At the inflow5
section, prescribed unsteady velocities are imposed and a zero-gradient condition is applied for
pressure specifications. At the outflow boundary, on the other hand, a zero-gradient condition is7
used for the velocities and the sectional average pressure is set as the reference pressure of the
instantaneous flow field.9
6. VERIFICATIONS
To verify the accuracy of the numerical predictions, preliminary simulations of a steady uniform11
flow past a square cylinder at a zero attack angle are conducted. Based on the results in the middle
span-wise section of three-dimensional calculations (266×96×86grids), Table I illustrates the13
predicted mean and root-mean-square drag and lift coefficients as well as the Strouhal number
(St = fs D/Uo, fs being the shedding frequency), compared with the experimental results by Lee15
[12]. It can be seen that good agreement is obtained.
It also shows in Table II that the span-wise local and averaged quantities are very close to17
those in the middle section. To examine the span-wise flow behavior in the same case with a
steady approaching flow, Figure 3 illustrates the correlation coefficients of the velocity histories19
at a selected location (about 1.6D downstream of the leeward cylinder surface near the center
line). The auto-correlation plot (R0,0), associated with the middle section results, indicates that21
the normalized time lag cycle (8.20) is equal to the reciprocal of the Strouhal number (0.122). In
addition, the cross correlations of the results between two different span-wise sections (R0,−4D23
and R0,+2D) show that the plots are similar but with certain time lags. Accordingly, one can see
that the selected span-wise domain size (10D) is large enough to describe the coherent structure25
of vortices in the span-wise direction.

Additional numerical computations are performed in certain selected cases of a square cylinder1
in sinusoidal approaching flows with zero-mean velocities. After obtaining the calculated drag
and lift histories, the mean and inertia force coefficients associated with Morison equations are3
determined by performing least-square regressions according to Equations (1) and (2). Figure
4 shows the predicted force coefficients compared with the experimental results from Okajima5
et al. [5] and Bearman et al. [8]. The good agreement also shows the accuracy of the numerical
predictions. Further calculations are carried out in the cases of Nomura et al. [9]. It indicates in7
Table IV that the results are again well predicted.

Physically, Keulegan–Carpenter number can be regarded as the ratio between the translation of1
a fluid particle within a period of T and the transverse dimension of the cylinder [2]. Difficulty
is encountered, however, as KC is used to reflect the extent of approaching-flow unsteadiness in3
the analysis. For example, one KC value can be the outcome of either a large Um with a small T
or a small Um with a large T , which correspond to two significantly different approaching-flow5
conditions. Accordingly, the amplitude velocity ratio (AR =Um/U0) is proposed to be the second
parameter in the study to characterize the variation of the approaching flow more specifically. Once7
AR is determined, a larger KC then indicates that the extent of the approaching-flow unsteadiness
becomes milder. Consequently, the program of the systematic analyses can then proceed in a more9
convenient way.

(=0◦, AR =0.5 and KC=4) appears quite interesting. The approaching-flow acceleration and
deceleration apparently affect the vortex motion, leading to deviation of the wake pattern from13
that of common Karman vortices. Further calculations of the numerical results show that the mean
drag coefficient is 2.272. Compared with that in the steady approaching case (2.046; see Table III),15
it reveals that the unsteadiness of the approaching flow tends to increase the mean drag force.

The general pattern of CD variations seems also interesting, as depicted in Figures 10(a)1
and 11(a). The same tendency is also detected on the CL variation at a non-zero attack angle
(Figure 12(a)). Mathematically, it can be shown that the ratio of AR/KC represents the normalized3
oscillation frequency of the approaching flow. As this ratio is near the Strouhal number of the
bluff-body flow, the mean drag coefficient (CD) is greatly promoted. Consequently, CD reaches a5
peak value due to the occurrence of resonance. In addition, the resulting peak values of CD (Figures
10(a) and 11(a)) and CL (Figure 12(a)) increase with an increase of AR , implying that the extent7
of resonance effect is enhanced when the amplitude velocity of the approaching flow becomes
greater. Moreover, when KC is sufficiently large, the extent of the approaching-flow unsteadiness9
becomes weaker, leading to the result that CD (or CL) tends to the CD (or CL) value, corresponding
to the steady approaching-flow case.11
Figures 10(b)–12(b) show that the tendencies of C˜D and C˜L variations are different from those
of CD and CL. Since C˜D and C˜L are related, respectively, to the inertia part of drag and lift, they13
do not appear to be affected by the occurrence of resonance. As a result, C˜D and C˜L start with
large values then decrease rapidly as KC increases and eventually tend to zeros.15
Based on the numerical results, finally, Figure 14 illustrates typically (AR =0.3,=0◦) the
resulting mean and inertia coefficients as a function of KC. One can see that as Re exceeds 105,17
the results are insensitive to the change of Reynolds number.

1 INTRODUCTION 
The aerodynamic instability of a suspension bridge is generally of great concern in design 
since the long-span structure is sensitive to wind. Physically, when wind passes the bridge, 
which usually possesses a blunt shape, vortex shedding occurs and leads to unsteady wind 
load on the structure. If the extent of the resulting bridge vibration is significant, it can affect 
the surrounding flow and further promote the structural response. Therefore, the analysis of 
the interaction between the structure motion and the wind flow is considered necessary. 
In order to investigate the dynamics of the bridge as well as the corresponding wind effects, 
the method of model experiments is commonly used. Economically, however, the application 
of appropriate numerical methods can be another option. Moreover, the numerical results can 
provide more extensive information for the analysis of flow-structure interactive problems. 
Besides the physical properties of the bridge, the shape of the bridge deck is also an important 
factor in affecting its aerodynamic behavior. To investigate the effect of the deck shape, three 
basic geometries of the deck cross-sections (a rectangle, a trapezoid and a hexagon) are se-
lected for the analyses according to the concept of a section model. By performing extensive 
examinations on the resulting fluctuating responses, net damping ratios and flutter derivatives, 
the instability associated with the three bridge decks are assessed. Finally, the aerodynamic 
performances of the three bridge decks are compared in terms of the critical flutter speeds. 
2 RELATED STUDIES 
A number of researchers have investigated experimentally the mechanisms of wind-
induced vibration of suspension bridges. Typically, Scanlan and Tomko [1] proposed a semi-
experimental and semi-analytical approach regarding flutter derivatives, and this approach is 
presently widely used. Sarkar et al. [2] suggested a system identification procedure to esti-
mate all the flutter derivatives simultaneously. In their study, numerical simulations and re-
duction of the experimentally-obtained direct derivatives were presented. Iwamoto and Fujino 
[3] proposed a method of simultaneous identification of flutter derivatives of bridge decks 
from free-vibration data. They showed, by experiments, that an increase of mass and inertial 
moment of a section model lead to better accuracy in identifying the flutter derivatives at high 
wind speeds. Additionally, based on the experimental results from a coupled heaving-
torsional free vibration of a spring-suspended section model, Gu et al. [4] employed a least-
square theory and proposed an identification method to obtain flutter derivatives. Moreover, 
Noda et al. [5] evaluated the flutter derivatives of thin rectangular cylinders and found that the 
effect of oscillation amplitudes could be significant. 
Besides wind tunnel model tests, the method of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has also 
been used to examine the aerodynamic performance and aeroelastic stability of long-span 
bridges. Kuroda [6] presented a numerical simulation of high-Reynolds-number flows past a 
fixed section model with a shallow hexagonal cross-section. The overall characteristics of 
measured static force coefficients were well captured by the computations. Lee et al. [7] in-
vestigated numerically the wind loading characteristics for turbulent flows past a bridge deck 
cross-section. The two-dimensional flow results were further used to perform three-
dimensional dynamic structural analyses on a non-interactive basis. Fang et al. [8] proposed a 
numerical method to simulate the surrounding wind flow and to predict the corresponding dy-
namic responses of a bridge deck with a rectangular cross-section. By employing a partially 
interactive procedure, the dynamic responses of the deck agreed well with the measurement 
results in a case where torsional responses were relatively insignificant. Furthermore, im-
provements were made successfully by Fang et al. [9, 10] to analyze the motion of a bridge 
with a trapezoidal and hexagonal cross-section based on a completely interactive procedure.

4.2 Numerical program 
The numerical simulations contain two separate computations which are performed by an 
interactive procedure. To predict the unsteady flow around the decks, a weakly-compressible-
flow method [11] with a dynamic subgrid-scale turbulence model [12] is applied. After an in-
stantaneous flow field is simulated, the resulting wind load is taken as an input to further 
compute the corresponding structure responses. The resulting deflections and the vibrating 
speeds of the deck are then fed back to the boundary specifications at the deck surfaces for the 
flow calculations in the next time step. The alternative solutions of the flow field and the deck 
motion are considered the results of the interactive dynamic behavior of the two.

are considered reasonably small to avoid the amplitude effects [5].

5.2    Net Aerodynamic Damping Ratio 
Based on the numerical results, Fig. 7 depicts the variations of the net damping ratios in the 
heaving direction of the decks at various approaching wind speeds. Generally, the variations 
of the ratios in the heaving direction start from the value of the material damping (0.54%, 
0.56% and 0.58% respectively) then increase monotonically with an increase of the wind 
speed. Also, the effect due to the change of  β appears insignificant.

Figure 7: Calculated net damping ratios in the heaving direction. 
In the torsional direction, in contrast, the variation patterns of the net damping ratios appear 
rather different (see Fig. 8). The damping ratio starts with the material damping value (0.77%, 
0.79% and 0.72%) and increases with an increase in wind speed until Ur is respectively about 
2.11, 2.68 and 2.61 . After that, the ratio decreases. As the reduced velocity exceeds 11.13, 
12.04 and 13.68 respectively, the net damping ratio becomes less than that of the correspond-
ing material damping. Finally, the ratio drops to zero. It is noticed that although the change of 
the attack angle (β) has some effect on the variation of the net damping ratios at low wind 
speeds, its effect on the onset velocity of response divergence is very mild.

5.3    Flutter Derivatives 
Figs. 9 and 10 show the variations of the flutter derivatives of all the deck cases corre-
sponding to the most critical attack angle (β=±8° for the rectangular and hexagonal decks; 
β=0° for the trapezoidal deck). It can be seen that those related to the aeroelastic forces in the 
heaving direction ( *1H  to 
*
4H ) are all negative within the wind speed range. In the torsional 
direction, on the other hand, all related derivatives are positive except the one associated with 
the torsional speed ( *2A ), which is initially negative at lower wind speeds then becomes posi-
tive as Ur exceeds 11.25, 12.04 and 13.68, respectively. Fig. 9 also shows that the reduced 
velocities when *2A  changes its sign are the same as those when the torsional net aerodynamic 
damping ratios become less than the material damping ratios.

6.3    Mechanism of Deck Instability 
In the present deck cases, the mechanism of the occurrence of flutter is explored by exam-
ining the variations of the net damping ratios. Fig. 7 shows that the resulting net damping ra-
tio of the heaving mode is always larger than that of the material damping, indicating that the 
induced positive aerodynamic damping ratio due to the deck motion tends to suppress the 
heaving structure responses. By examining the results from Fig. 8, on the other hand, it can be 
seen that the net damping ratios of the torsional mode drop to zero at the critical flutter speeds. 
Accordingly, one can then conclude that although the fluctuating responses diverge in both 
directions at the critical flutter speeds (see Figs. 5 and 6), the instability of all the decks is in 
actually subject to torsional flutter. 
6.4    Comparison of Deck Instability  
Among the three cases in the study, the normalized critical flutter speeds ( crV ) are respec-
tively 13.41 (rectangle), 14.32 (trapezoid) and 15.80 (hexagon). The hexagonal deck pos-
sesses the best stability performance. Compared to that of the rectangular deck, the critical 
flutter speeds of the hexagonal and trapezoidal decks are greater for about 18% and 7%, re-
spectively. 
7 CONCLUSION 
The interaction between a suspension bridge with three types of deck shapes and the sur-
rounding flow has been extensively examined by adopting numerical computations. After 
comparison with wind tunnel results, the proposed numerical model has been proved to be 
adequate in predicting wind effects as well as the dynamic behavior of the deck with good 
accuracy. Based on the numerical results, the aerodynamic instability performance of the 
three decks are discussed and compared extensively in terms of the root-mean-square deck 
responses, the net aerodynamic damping ratios, the flutter derivatives and the critical flutter 
speeds. Finally, it is concluded that the hexagonal deck possesses the stability performance 
than the other two. Compared to that of the rectangular deck, the critical flutter speeds of the 
hexagonal and trapezoidal decks are greater for about 18% and 7%, respectively.
