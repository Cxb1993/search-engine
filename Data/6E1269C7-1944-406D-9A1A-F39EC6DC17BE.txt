lower one is consisted of unliquefied layer. Goals of this project are to study the responded shear force of 
pile segments of the pile foundation due to seismic effect and to suggest a reference for the seismic 
design of pile foundation. 
 
2 Past studies 
It can be divided into two major methodologies that researchers apply to capture the soil- pile 
interaction considering soil liquefaction by numerical analysis. One is p-y method that is to use the 
Winkler assumption is that the resistance of the soil-pile interaction at any depth is related to the pile 
shaft displacement at that depth only, independent of the interaction of the resistance above and below, 
the other is to use FEM that is to describe a pile-soil-superstructure system, in which the nonlinearity of 
the soils, the piles, and the interaction between the soils and the structures should be considered 
simultaneously and meshed in the code. Herein, the related studies are introduced. 
Some researchers have used the p-y curve concept to analyze pile foundations in association with 
liquefaction phenomena, which is shown in Fig. 1. Wilson (1998) investigated soil-pile interaction by 
back-calculating dynamic p-y time histories to examine the mechanism of the soil-pile-superstructure 
interaction in an effective stress analysis, and some of the results can be found in his paper (Wilson 2000). 
Christina et al. (2001) once again used the BNWF and simplified a two-step method in which the 
superstructure and the foundation were considered separately in the analysis. These studies, which are 
based on the methodology of the p-y curves to represent the soil surrounding the piles, employs a 
so-called subgrading method in the calculations. Lin et al. (2004) also applied the similar concept on 
analyzing interaction between pile and liquefied soils with the consideration of buckling effect of 
concrete piles. However, due to the disadvantage of the independent springs to represent a ground 
behavior, Wilson (1998) even emphasized that the finite element method (FEM) is required for a more 
advanced research of the pile-soil-structure simulations.  
Other researchers have used FEM to catch the interaction, which is shown in Fig. 2. Anandarajah et 
al. (1995) conducted a 2-D finite element analysis to simulate a pile supported, two-story structure under 
earthquake shaking, in which the isotropic bounding surface model was used to describe the stress-strain 
relation of the soils. Fukutake et al. (1995) considered 3-D finite element analysis with the soil behavior 
described by the Ramberg-Osgood model and under effective stress conditions. Finn and Wu (1997) 
developed a quasi 3-D method to reproduce the dynamic nonlinear behavior of pile foundations. Due to 
the limitations of the constitutive models adopted for soils, additional assumptions were made to 
compensate for the insufficiency of the models, e.g., tension cutoff and shearing cutoff were applied in 
order to describe the gapping between the soil and the piles and yielding phenomena. Oka (2002) applied 
a 3D numerical model to simulate a full system that includes upper structure, foundation and ground. In 
their study, a case study is researched with the numerical code. The simulated results showed the 
damaged pile segments are not only at upper pile, which is close to the pile cap but also at the boundary, 
which is between liquefied and un-liquefied soils.  
Lu (2003) conducted a series of numerical simulations on both single pile and group piled 
foundations to understand the interactions between soils and piles. It is found that superstructure is saved 
due to the sandy soils liquefaction with reduced response accelerations (1/2 time) and lengthened period 
(6 times longer) in the study. However, the more precise reference figure for the seismic design cannot be 
obtained in this study due to the limited study of different frequency superstructures and seismic 
excitements.  
Governing Equations 
In this proposed research, the governing equations for the coupling problems between soil skeleton 
and pore water are going to be observed with the two phase mixture theory (Biot, 1962). Using a u-p 
(displacement of the solid phase- pore water pressure) formulation (Zienkiewicz and Bettes, 1982), FEM 
is used for the spatial discretization of equilibrium equations and FDM is used for spatial discretization 
of pore water pressure in the continuity equation (Akai and Tamura, 1978). The stress and strain are 
defined at the center of the element by using a reduced numerical integration method to avoid the shear 
locking under undrained condition. Verification of this model was shown by Oka et al. (1994) comparing 
the numerical results with the analytical solutions for the transient response of saturated porous solids. 
The governing equations are formulated by the following assumptions; 
(1) Infinitesimal strain 
(2) Smooth distribution of soil porosity 
(3) Much smaller relative acceleration between fluid phase to that of solid phase than the acceleration of 
solid phase 
(4) Incompressible soil grain particles 
The equilibrium equation for the mixture is derived as following: 
 (1) 
where  is density of the total phase,   is the acceleration of the solid,   is the total stress tensor and   
is the body force. 
The continuity equation is derived as follows: 
 (2) 
where   is density of the fluid phase,  is the pore water pressure,   is the unit weight of fluid,  is the 
permeability coefficient. 
Constitutive model for sandy soils 
Constitutive model law of sands based on finite deformation theory that will be applied in this 
project is proposed by Oka (1992, 1999). Several features in this cyclic elasto- plastic model are listed as 
follows: 
(1) Non-linear kinematic hardening rule 
(2) Non-associated flow 
(3) Over-consolidation boundary 
(4) Generalized flow rule 
(5) Strain dependency of shear stiffness 
 
Details of this model are given in Oka et al. (1992, 1999), a brief description of it is expressed 
herein. 
The flow rule of Oka model is  
 (3) 
 
 (4) 
where ijklH is a fourth- rank tensor,  is the plastic potential function.

Trilinear model for pile 
If only monotonic loading is considered, the nonlinearity of the relation between the bending 
moment and the curvature of a pile (M-Φ relation) can be simulated by a trilinear model in which the 
influence of the axial force on the M-Φ relation can easily be treated (Adachi et al. 1994). In cyclic 
loading, however, it is difficult to give a proper description of the influence of the axial force on the M-Φ 
relation within the framework of a trilinear model. For this reason, the M-Φ relation of a pile is simulated 
here by a kinematic hardening trilinear model, taking into consideration the hysteresis of loading and 
unloading, as shown in Figure 5. The influence of the axial force on the M-Φ relation has to be 
disregarded. In the M-Φ relation, Mc, My, and Mu represent the cracking, the yielding, and the ultimate 
moments of the beam materials, respectively, while Φc, Φy, and Φu represent the corresponding 
curvatures of the beam materials. However, in this proposed research, the axial load is less significant 
influential to a single pile foundation, therefore, for the sake of simplicity, the pile is going to be treated 
as a trilinear model.

Figure 10 shows kinematic bending moment of pile segment at the soil boundaries. It can be found 
that the bending moment in the dry sand and Dr=80 saturated sandy soils do not increase with the change 
of mass of pile head. It is very obvious to see that in the fully liquefied soils the bending moment severely 
increases not only because of the kinematic moment but of the inertia moments.  
Figure 11 shows the bending moment distribution of pile in the case of input wave as Kobe 
earthquake while largest bending moment of pile at soil boundaries take place. One can find that between 
Dr=60 saturated sandy layer and dry sandy layer, an obvious bending moment takes place at the soil 
boundary.

Figure 12 shows the bending moment distribution of pile in the case of input wave as ChiChi 
earthquake while largest bending moment of pile at soil boundaries take place. One can find that between 
Dr=60 saturated sandy layer and dry sandy layer, an obvious bending moment takes place at the soil 
boundary. It is also interesting to notice that though Dr=90 sandy soils, no matter saturated or dry, does not 
liquefy in Figure 11 and 12 and supposed to be quite hard so that the deformation of the ground is not very 
significant, however, a certain level of bending moment generated at the low pile segment. This is due to 
the strength differences between dense sandy soils and the clayey soils.
