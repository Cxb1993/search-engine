1. Introduction 
 
With the advance of the Internet, today’s interconnected environment creates a world of global 
competition with time pressure, complexity, and rapid changes and leads the products to have 
special characteristics different from past, such as global marketing, short time-to-market, short 
life cycle, and high customization. With these conditions, each individual entity can respond to 
the oncoming features of this global competitive environment with global collaboration with 
other partners via the Internet. Many existed successful cases in operating with the global 
collaboration, such as IBM, Motorola, Boeing and so on; those operate with numerous businesses 
partners worldwide for creating their high degree of competitiveness. Thus it can be seen that 
global collaboration is an operative and significant business affairs.  
With the tendency towards global collaboration, we intend to address the issue of a virtual 
alliance (VA)/virtual team formation based on multi- and mobile agent technology, named 
MAVAF (Multi- Mobile Agent based Virtual Alliance Formation). MAVAF enables the ability 
to search potential partners around the vast Internet automatically that would provide the great 
help for the VA initiators to organize their virtual alliance efficiently and rapidly.  
 
1.1 Agent Technology 
 
The word agent was derived from the notion of software agents. The term was introduced to the 
area of artificial intelligence (AI) and it has been used since the mid-1970s. Most authors refer to 
the paper written by Hewitt [1] as origin of the term agent. An agent is a software entity that 
continuously performs tasks given by a user within a particular restricted environment 
autonomously. The autonomy characteristic of a software agent distinguishes it from general 
software programs. 
A mobile agent is a particular class of agent with the ability during execution to migrate from 
one host to another where it can resume its execution. It has been suggested that mobile agent 
technology, amongst other things, can help to reduce network traffic and to overcome network 
latencies [2]. Besides, the rationale behind the idea of developing a mobile agent based 
infrastructure (MAVAF) for wide-area forming the VA team efficiently and rapidly is its various 
advantages over traditional client-server approach: flexible server behavior, convenient 
development paradigm, executed asynchronously and autonomously, adapted dynamically, 
supporting for heterogeneous environments, and robustness and fault tolerance [2]. 
Java Agent DEvelopment Framework (JADE) [3] is a framework that facilitates the 
development of agent applications in compliance with the FIPA (The Foundation of Intelligent 
Physical Agents) [4], an IEEE standards, specifications for interoperable intelligent multi-agent 
systems. FIPA is an IEEE Computer Society standards organization that promotes agent-based 
technology, and its specifications represent a collection of standards such as naming service and 
yellow-page service, message transport and parsing service, and a library of FIPA interaction 
protocols ready to be used. In JADE, a runtime environment is called a container as it can contain 
several agents. A set of active containers is called a platform. In a platform, there is a special 
 3
2. System Architecture 
 
The MAVAF is composed of five types of architectural components as depicted in Fig. 2: 
Knowledge-based data Server, Provider Agent (PA), User Agent (UA) Coordinator Agent (CA), 
and Registrant Agent (RA). 
 
 
Fig. 2. MAVAF architecture. 
 
z Provider Agent (PA) 
The PA is a stationary agent and operates at a higher level of trust and mediates access resources 
from mobile agents to the knowledge-based data server. In MAVAF, the PA plays an important 
role to dynamically interface with the knowledge-based data server. Through PA, mobile agent 
can obtain the resources in the knowledge-based data server. The PA would take the place of the 
web sites to bridge the users to the databases. There are two primitive agents organized by the PA 
organizing agent: 
 Account Agent: 
The Account Agent is a static agent that controls access to and from a container, as well as 
initially mediating access to agents within the container. The account agent is also 
responsible for enforcing security policies. The Account Agent maintains the users’ accounts 
and resource usage records in the knowledge-based data server.   
 Resource Management Agent: 
The Resource Management Agent is also a static agent that abstracts and controls access to 
the knowledge-based data server. The agent is responsible for advertising the services 
offered by the knowledge-based data server, for providing an ontological description of 
those services and for providing complete access to the resource of knowledge-based data 
server.  
 
 5
 Initialization Agent: 
It is the same as for the CA Initialization Agent and is used in initializing the status of the 
mobile agent.  
 Information Management Agent: 
The Information Management Agent is responsible for managing the information from 
registrant and PA. It manages the correlative data in every profile maintenance mission, which 
involves profile contents of maintenance and a copy of registrant’s profile data. 
 
z Knowledge-based data Server 
The Knowledge-based data Server works with the Provider Agent and stores the user’s 
information, called profile. A user profile encapsulates the interests, skills, experiences, capacities, 
etc. of the user. All the users’ information and their capabilities are stored in the 
Knowledge-based data Server. 
 
3. Usage Scenarios 
 
The objective of this research is to design and develop a mobile agent based information platform 
to support the intensive and distributed nature of virtual alliance formation that allows the 
initiators to select prospects using a PDA, laptop, or desktop computer. Under this circumstance, 
two types of users are distinguished in the proposed system: Initiators and Registrants who are 
interested in participating challenge projects over the Internet. In this section, we describe usage 
scenarios from these two types of users respectively, and we also depict the prototyping in the 
rest part of this section. 
 
3.1 Scenario 1: Initiators’ Perspective – exploring team members 
 
Mr. John Smith has come up with a brilliant product idea, which can potentially be a hot item in a 
niche market. Consequently, he is inspired to get the product to the market as early as possible. 
Through his PC or PDA, he specifies the capability requirements for the team members using 
UA’s GUI and makes a request of exploring potential candidates (see Step1 of Fig. 3). Upon 
receiving the request, the UA launches and delegates the job to a mobile agent, the CA via a local 
container (see Step2 of Fig. 3). Mr. Smith may then switch off his device and proceed with his 
daily work. In the mean time, the CA will surf in the logical mobile agent networks and work 
with available PA, which are static in data containers to identify potentially qualified team 
members. When a data container with potential people is found, the CA will send a request 
notification to the PA for retrieving the person’s profile data (see Step3 of Fig. 3). If the PA 
approved the request notification, the PA will retrieve the data using SQL request and 
subsequently deliver to the CA (see Step4, 5, 6 of Fig. 3). The CA will continue pursuing the 
delegated tasks until it does all nodes of the network. Once the CA completes the trip, it displays 
the data acquired on the application GUI when Mr. Smith is back on line with his device (see 
Step7, 8 of Fig. 3). Fig. 4 shows the user interface windows of the VA initiator.

4. Conclusion 
 
In this paper, we have presented a mobile multi- agent enabled information infrastructure 
MAVAF based on the JADE platform, which encapsulates potentials to reduce the VA formation 
cycle time for the VA initiators. Multi-agent systems have a great potential to encourage the 
process efficiency of the VA formation. Despite the appealing nature of MAVAF, the works has 
undergone for improving the system are: 
1. Security improvement: the information transmitted between agents can be classified and 
sensitive. The JADE equips with a security plug-in, which enables a set of security features 
and provides the base technology for such agent-based application as MAVAF. However, 
more robust and comprehensive security mechanisms need to be incorporated in MAVAF. 
2. The MAVAF was built on top of an open and scalable platform JADE, which makes the 
system extensible. Coordinator Agent incorporating with partner selection and the capability 
evaluation function can be independently developed and dynamically plugged in to the 
system. As an essential extension of this work, robust partner selection and evaluation 
strategies are explored to enhance the effectiveness of decision potential partner searching 
and integrated into the MAVAF. The overall system performance can subsequently be 
strengthened.

 3 REQUREMENT STUDY The operating room (OR) is one of the most complex 
work environments in health care. Compared with other 
hospital settings, errors in the operating room can be 
particularly catastrophic and, in some cases, can result in 
high-profile consequences for a surgeon and an institution. 
In addition, the high rate of adverse events in surgery is 
incessantly demonstrated. According to a sentinel event 
alert issued Dec 5, 2001, by the Joint Commission on 
Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), 
“fifty-eight percent of the cases occurred in either a 
hospital-based ambulatory surgery unit or freestanding 
ambulatory setting, with 29 percent occurring in the 
inpatient operating room and 13 percent in other inpatient 
sites such as the Emergency Department or ICU. Seventy-
six percent involved surgery on the wrong body part or site; 
13 percent involved surgery on the wrong body part or site; 
and 11 percent involved the wrong surgical procedure” 
(The Joint Commission: The Joint Commission Home Page. 
http://www.jointcommission.org/).After the astonishing 
report published by JCAHO Gawande et al., in 2003, 
analyzed errors reported by surgeons at three teaching 
hospitals and found that seventy-seven percent involved 
injuries related to an operation or other invasive 
intervention (visceral injuries, bleeding, and wound 
infection/dehiscence were the most common subtypes), 
13% involved unnecessary or inappropriate procedures, and 
10% involved unnecessary advancement of disease. In 
addition, two thirds of the incidents involved errors during 
the intra-operative phase of surgical care, 27% during pre-
operative management, and 22% during post-operative 
management (Gawande, A. A. et al. 2003). 
 
As mentioned in the previous chapters, the high rate of 
sentinel events in surgery has been incessantly 
demonstrated. Among all sentinel events, performing a 
procedure on the wrong site or the wrong patient is mostly 
preventable and should never happen. Much literature 
claims that systems must be put in place to render it 
essentially impossible or at least extremely difficult for 
human error to cause harm to patients. Among a lot of 
novel technologies, RFID is an enabling technology that is 
generally considered to improve patient safety and savings 
in hospital. This technology has been applied for many 
fields but few applications specified to OR. Moreover, little 
literature analyzed from the business processes’ point of 
view to reap the benefits of RFID but focus on an object or 
an individual. Therefore, we proposed using RFID from the 
processes’ point of view to detect errors that may lead to 
wrong site or the wrong patient surgery. 
 
Before an RFID implantation, opportunity survey 
based on business process analysis is necessary. The survey 
consists of the following phases: 
Expert interview and site survey :  Expert 
interview and site survey have conducted to comprehend 
the process in OR. 
Existing OR Process: Based on the result of expert 
interview and site survey, we described the existing OR 
process. 
IDEF0 modeling: IDEF0 modeling technique is 
adopted to (1) build the OR as-is model based on the 
result of previous step, (2) analyze the activities in the 
previous OR process. 
 
Within all kinds of surgical adverse events, wrong-
side/wrong-site, wrong-procedure, and wrong-patient 
adverse events (WSPEs) are the most devastating, 
unacceptable, and often result in litigation. However, an 
estimate of 1300 to 2700 WSPEs per year based on the 
available databases, extensive review of the literature, and 
discussion with regulators in the United States seems likely. 
(Seiden, S. C., Barach, P. 2006) A variety of studies 
have demonstrated that the rates of adverse events 
associated with surgery are substantial. Of course, surgery 
inherently carries risk, and only 17 per cent of these 
adverse events were judged to be preventable (Bates, D.W. 
2004). Nonetheless, this important proportion of surgical 
adverse events is preventable given what is known today. 
Systems must be put in place to render it essentially 
impossible or at least extremely difficult for human error to 
cause harm to patients. With the introduction of new 
approaches many other complications that are not 
associated with an obvious error may be preventable in the 
future. 
RFID-based OR Process：Based on the results 
of previous steps, we described an RFID-based state for 
the process. 
 
3.1 Expert Interview and Site Survey  
 
Before an RFID implantation, opportunity survey 
based on business process analysis is necessary. However, 
how an enterprise is typically recorded only in the heads of 
the experts who operate that enterprise, not in company 
manuals. This experience can also be applied in a hospital. 
Surgeons, nurses and anesthetists are the experts who know 
what happens behind the closed doors of the operating 
department. They clearly know their job functions and 
workflow during surgery. For this reason, we undertook 
several expert interviews with the medical staff worked in 
an operating department of a regional teaching hospital in 
Taoyuan to comprehend the operative process. Except 
expert interviews, we also perform site survey to observe 
the activities in OR. The activities during on-site survey

December 3rd – 5th, 2008      Nusa Dua, Bali – INDONESIA  
2450
  
many activities during model development stage by 
discussing with medical staff. 
 
In this section, first, we built the “as-is” model to 
define activities and functions in OR. The definition of “as-
is” is a description of the current situation in terms of the 
work processes. With sufficient information regarding the 
as-is operation, analyzing current process and building a 
new system become easier. Second, we examined the 
model, found out the operations which probably threaten to 
patient safety or make medical staff ineffective and 
analyzed the opportunity for introducing RFID to solve the 
problem. 
3.3.1 Building “as-is” Model 
 
After expert interviews and on-site survey, the OR as-
is model was constructed. The purpose of this model is to 
find out the systemic vulnerabilities that may lead to human 
error and the opportunities that can improve medical staff’s 
operations by introducing RFID technology. The model 
was developed from the OR medical staff’s viewpoint. 
 
Figure 1 depicts the top-level function of the IDEF0 
model, “perform surgery”. The activity called “performi
ng surgery” is broadly defined as all activities during 
per-, intra- and post operations. In other words, all act
ivities happened during the period which begins with a
 patient arriving at the holding area of an OR suite a
nd ends up in the patient returning to ward are includ
ed. Figure 2 shows the top-level function decomposed 
into six more specific functions, representing the surger
y process in more detail. Note that the general inputs,
 outputs, controls, and mechanisms from Figure 1 are 
also decomposed, illustrating the progressive exposure 
of detail that is a feature of the IDEF0 methodology; 
Figure 3 shows the decomposition of the activity “pati
ent check-in” at an even higher level of detail. In the
 same way, Figure 4, 5 and 6 shows the decompositio
n of the other activities in detail.

 3.3.2 As-is Model Analysis and RFID Solutions 
 
After building the OR as-is model and numbers of 
meeting with related medical personnel, we discovered that 
there were a lot of systemic vulnerabilities that may lead to 
human error. In real situations, not every OR member 
completely follows the Standard Operating Procedures 
(SOP). If some accidental situations happen, wrong patient, 
wrong site/side surgery, unsuitable anesthesia or wrong OR 
event may occur. Based on the as-is model, the possible 
human errors and inefficient operations are listed as 
follows: 
1. Misidentification of patients: According to the as-is 
model, the nurse verifies the patient's identity by 
asking the patient his/her full name and checks it with 
both the patient's identification bracelet and medical 
record. If frontline healthcare staff did not 
successfully verify a person’s identity, wrong patient 
may be taken into OR. In other words, if an 
exceptional case happens, the manual process is 
probably permitted errors to cause wrong patient 
surgery. Failure to correctly identify patients 
constitutes one of the most serious risks to patient 
safety; however, in the OR, it can even cost a life. 
 
2. Entering the wrong OR: In general, a teaching 
medical center has numbers of contiguous ORs, each 
performing two to three cases daily. Moreover, OR 
schedule varies frequently. Hence, there are many 
opportunities for surgeons or patients to enter the 
wrong ORs. If a patient or a surgeon enters a wrong 
OR without reconfirm, the event of wrong surgery 
could happen.  
 
3. Inducing unsuitable anesthesia: An anesthetist has 
to make the final decision regarding the anesthetics 
and methods of delivery at the time of surgery. 
Therefore, providing sufficient information to the 
anesthetist is very important. In general, the critical 
information that aids an anesthetist making decision 
must be obtained from both ways: verbally asking the 
patient and reviewing some data described in the 
medical record. The questions now arise: first, some 
critical information even was not recorded in a 
patient’s medical record. History of allergy and 
family history, for example, only can be received by 
asking patients. If the patient is not conscious or too 
elderly to answer the questions from medical staff, it 
would cause the patient to be exposed to danger. 
Second, looking for the unfiltered data on the paper is 
inefficient to anesthesia staff.  
 
4. Performing wrong operations: Wrong operation 
mentioned here includes performing wrong 
procedures on a patient or perform a surgery on the 
wrong site/side of a patient’s body. Based on the as-is 
model, the doctor conforms patient’s operation-
related information by checking the patient’s medical 
record and surgery-site chart that describes the 
surgical site/side of a patient. However, because it is 
not convenient to find out disperse data by looking up 
the paper-based medical records, doctors sometimes 
depend on their memory for patients' condition 
without double-check. In addition, when a surgeon 
substitutes for another surgeon to perform a surgery 
or a surgeon operates on more than one patient at the 
same time, the wrong operation may be performed. 
 
5. Inefficiently updating patient’s states: Based on the 
as-is model, nurses have to manually update a 
patient’s status information (in surgery, in recovery, 
etc.) in the hospital information system when the 
patient’s status is changed. However, the essence of 
the OR nurses is to provide care and support to 
patients before, during, and after surgery. This kind of 
unrelated activity distracts medical staff and obstructs 
medical professionals providing better patient care. 
 
As mentioned above, not every OR member 
completely follows the SOPs in real situations. Therefore, 
if some accidental situations happen, wrong patient, wrong 
site/side surgery, unsuitable anesthesia or wrong OR event 
may occur. Table1 shows potential cases that may threaten 
patient’s safety in the as-is model.

 1. Admission into the operating suite 
 
When a surgical patient is scheduled to be operated 
upon, the nurse in the ward assigns the patient an RFID-
embedded wristband encoded with a unique ID. When the 
surgical patient is brought to the holding area in the OR 
suite, an RFID reader automatically verifies the identity of 
the patient. If the details of the patient and operation 
schedule match, the monitor in the holding area displays 
some brief information about the patient. Simultaneously, 
the system automatically changes the patient’s status 
information to “waiting for surgery” in the database. Then, 
the patient’s status information can be displayed on the 
screen located in the waiting area; this helps in reducing the 
anxiety of his/her family members. 
 
2. 2. Admission into operating room 
 
The RFID readers in the OR automatically capture the 
information on the patient’s tag to identify him/her upon 
entering the OR. If the details of the patient and the OR 
into which he/she has entered match, the screen in the OR 
displays the patient’s information, including his/her name, 
age, gender, laboratory test data, digital surgery-site chart, 
and scheduled procedure, by associating the tag’s ID 
number with the patient records stored in the hospital 
information system. However, if an unscheduled patient 
enters the OR, the system can alert the medical staff to take 
the necessary measures in the OR. Thus, unfamiliar faces 
can be checked with assurance, thereby decreasing the 
probability of performing the procedure on a wrong patient. 
Subsequently, the system automatically changes the 
patient’s status information to “in surgery” after confirming 
that the correct patient has entered the correct OR. In 
addition, because the time is automatically recorded, the 
medical staff does not have to record the time manually.  
 
3. 3. Initiation of anesthesia 
 
When a tagged anesthetist or nurse enters the room, 
the system will also ensure that the person has entered the 
right room, thus preventing medical staff from rushing into 
the wrong OR and administering inappropriate medical 
treatment. In addition, information such as the history of 
allergy, family history, and laboratory test data, which aids 
the anesthetic team in determining the appropriate 
anesthetics and method of administration, is displayed on 
the monitor when the anesthetic team enters the OR. The 
anesthetist can then refer to this information without having 
to ask the patient or check through the patient reports. 
Furthermore, any abnormal values will be marked in red to 
bring them to the medical staff’s attention.  
 
4. Surgery 
In the same manner, when a surgeon enters the room, 
the system will also check whether the person has been 
assigned to the room, in order to prevent doctors from 
entering the wrong OR and performing surgery on the 
wrong person. If the patient has not yet been covered with 
surgical drapes, the surgeon can reconfirm the patient’s 
identity by matching the patient with a photograph 
displayed on the screen. In addition, the surgeon is also 
provided with the patient’s critical information on the 
digital display, rather than having to search for the pertinent 
information in the documented reports. Thus, bringing all 
this information together not only saves time but also 
increases patient safety. The surgeons are encouraged to 
confirm the patient records through the centralized data 
displayed on the monitor because of this increased 
accessibility. In the absence of such a system, doctors 
would generally depend on their memory, without 
performing any reconfirmation due to the inconvenience 
involved. However, with this system, the OR team can 
easily see a snapshot of a patient, thereby simplifying the 
process. 
 
5. Transfer to recovery  
 
After surgery, patients are transferred to the recovery 
area. Here, the RFID readers detect the patient’s RFID tags 
and the system automatically changes the patient’s status to 
“in recovery.” 
 
6. Discharge from operating suite 
 
After a patient recovers from anesthesia, the 
transporter brought the surgical patient leaving recovery 
room and returning to ward. At this time, the system 
automatically updates the patient’s status information to 
“returned to ward.”  
Figure 7 is a cross-functional flowchart constructed to 
describe the RFID-based process.

5. CONCLUSION 
 
Patient safety is the most important and 
uncompromised issue for medical institutions. In this 
research, we analyzed the existing OR process based on the 
as-is model and developed the RFID-based OR process. 
This RFID-based process can improve surgical patient 
safety and make medical staff efficient. From the surgical 
patient safety point of views, the RFID-based OR system 
(1) correctly identifies surgical patients, (2) automatically 
compares the OR which patients enter with the OR 
schedule, and (3) actively provides patients’ information to 
ensure that patients get correct procedures. The proposed 
system decreases the probability of medical errors such as 
wrong patients, wrong locations, wrong medical staff and 
wrong procedures. From the medical staff point of views, 
the system replaces some time-wasted manual input 
processes. Therefore, it will improve operational efficiency 
in the OR and consequently help medical professionals 
better manage patient care.

Abstract. E-health care is characterized by a high degree of distributed, labor-intensive works, mobility, time-
critical, and access from various types of devices. Continuous pervasive monitoring in e-health care has the 
potential to improve the quality of life of many persons (for example those who suffer from heart arrhythmias 
or pregnant women fetal monitoring). The monitoring Environment is typically a vast open setting that 
requires shared and distributed decision making and the communication of complex and diverse forms of 
information between a variety of devices and reasoning engines. Current and emerging developments in 
mobile computing integrated with developments in pervasive agent technologies such as intelligent agents 
and mobile agents will have a radical impact on future health-care delivery systems. In this research we 
attempt to implement a highly distributed information infrastructure –MADIP by using Intelligent Agent 
paradigm, which is capable of offering distance medical advice and continuous monitoring of medical 
conditions for critical needs of patients. A FIPA2000 Compliant Agent Development Environment - JADE 
(Java Agent Development Environment) was adopted for the implementation of interoperable intelligent 
multi-agent based MADIP systems. The rationale for selecting JADE as the development environment is that 
1) JADE is able to simplify development while ensuring standard compliance through a comprehensive set of 
system services and agents and 2) JADE offers an agent runtime system on which implement efficient FIPA 
2000 compliant multi-agent systems and supports their development through the availability of a predefined 
programmable agent model and of a set of management and testing tools.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1 Background and motives 
 
Mobile ubiquitous monitoring systems in the field of e-
health enable immediate analysis of individual 
physiological data and personalized patient feedback in real 
time using alarms and reminders. The systems monitor vital 
signs such as ECG (electrocardiography), EMG 
(electromyography), oxygen saturation, respiration, activity, 
and temperature. Patients can be remotely and ubiquitously 
assessed, diagnosed, and treated. In the case of rapidly 
deteriorating medical conditions, the systems can 
automatically notify associated medical staff by making 
mobile phone call or sending an SMS alarm to provide the 
patient with first-level medical support. Furthermore, 
scarce medical personnel are traditionally occupied with 
observing physiology parameters on the monitor screens 
sitting in the monitoring center on a 24-hours-per day, 7 
days-per week basis. The task of monitoring is a tedious 
duty for medical staff to simultaneously audit and interpret 
the massive amounts of information regarding a patient 
during the process of monitoring, performing diagnostics, 
and verifying therapeutic intervention. Some of 
complications have arisen from this situation because each 
medical personnel may be in charge of many patients. The 
development of multi-agent based mobile monitoring 
systems is capable of releasing medical staff from routine 
monitoring tasks and focusing on his/her daily works. With 
such a mobile monitoring system, patients benefit from 
better accessibility while medical staff can be more 
efficient and accurate in following up patient histories with 
easily available patient data. Families can reduce the time 
lost in visits to the hospital, which in turn reduces the 
number of occupied beds that require monitoring, making 
room for more critical patients. Governments also stand to

and the Swiss Institute Of Bioinformatics. The Independent 
LifeStyle Assistant (I.L.S.A.) (Karen et al., 2002) is also a 
multi-agent system that aid elderly people to live longer in 
their homes, increasing the duration of the independence 
from round the clock while maintaining important social 
connectedness and reducing caregiver burden. Those multi-
agent systems have to be devised to provide aid in carrying 
out activities of daily living, and health care maintenance. 
 
2.1 Agent Containers 
 
According to the specifications of the JADE agent plat
form, each running host of the MAVAF agent environment i
s called a Container, as it can contain several agents. The se
t of active containers is called a Platform. A single special 
Main Container must always be active and all other contain
ers register with it as soon as they start (JADE Tutorial, 
http://jade.tilab.com).  
 
The main container is an essential component, as 
specified by JADE, which manages all of the containers 
and agents in MAVAF. The other containers, called non-
main containers, are designed for such different purposes as 
the provision of external services and the connection with 
the client side. In MAVAF, external services are 
knowledge-based data server systems, called data 
containers, which store and manage the profile of the 
registrants involved with MAVAF. The non-main containers 
called client containers that are connected with the client 
side are responsible for providing MAVAF applications to 
users. Client containers are also equipped with mobile 
agents that are delegated to exchange data with data 
containers. 
 
3. Research Methodology  
 
3.1 Requirement Analysis 
 
Traditional health monitoring process consumes numerous 
time and traveling expenses for care-receivers to visit 
hospitals or health care sectors frequently. It is quite 
inconvenient for them, especially elders or long-term care-
receivers, to be present at the hospitals on a long trip 
regularly. However, health monitoring usually requires 
frequent vital signs check-up to ensure their health 
condition. With the growth of this population, e-health 
monitoring is now facing a profound challenge to provide 
better public health care nationwide. There is an urgent 
need to develop a system that is capable of performing 
ubiquitous electronic health monitoring automatically and 
autonomously to users who are usually mobile and situate 
in a low bandwidth, high latency, asynchronous transaction, 
and unstable connection environment. The system 
requirements for the proposed MADIP are therefore at least 
the following: 
 Openness: Each instance of MADIP installation situates 
at home with a technophobic client and a typically non-
standard monitoring device. The MADIP thus must be 
easily deployable configurable, and updated. MADIP is 
required to facilitate the evolution of a specific installation 
by providing an open architecture in which new devices 
and knowledge based modules may be integrated.  
Modularity: Due to the complexity of health monitoring 
domain, distributed and encapsulated expertise will be 
critical to the viability of MADIP. “Modularity”is thus 
another crucial requirement for MADIP to achieve the 
extendability by partition the functions into smaller logical 
units that can be modified, enhanced, or added functionality. 
To satisfy these requirements, a mobile multi-agent 
information platform MADIP that is implemented by JADE 
and allows MAs to work on behalf of health care 
professionals, to collect distributed users’vital sign data, 
and to spontaneously inform abnormal situations to 
associated health care professionals in real time is proposed 
in this research. 
 
3.2 MADIP System Design 
 
E-health care is a complex task which involves the 
sharing of expertise about medical knowledge, medical data, 
and services among care-receivers, specialists, as well as 
medical personnel. Moreover, an e-health care platform is 
composed by an open architecture, distributing 
physiological information and resources, multi-systems 
with heterogeneous components, storing bio-signals 
acquired from patients, and secure infrastructure. 
Consequently, a significant desire in the health care 
monitoring practice is stimulated to integrate several 
disparate and stand-alone subsystems and corresponding 
information repositories. In this research, JADE has been 
adopted among various multi-agent platforms as the 
underlined architecture and implementation of MADIP due 
to the following advantages (Kinshuk, 2002): 
1. Distributed autonomous applications development - 
In order to achieve the objectives of MADIP, agents that 
are autonomous, intelligent, and capable of communicating 
and collaborating need to be implemented. JADE simplifies 
such a development. 
2. Negotiation and coordination - In MADIP, JADE 
provides easy-to-use software libraries (i.e. patterns of 
interaction between agents) to solve negotiation and 
coordination among a set of agent, where the resources and 
the control logics are distributed in the environment. 
3. Pro-activity - JADE agents have been designed to 
control their own thread of execution. These agents can be

 agent identifiers (AID) and determined the privileges to be 
granted by the agent main container. The physician agent th
en will be sent to the Internet through Ethernet, wireless loc
al area network (WLAN), etc. After connected to Internet, t
he agent will continue doing the assigned monitoring job de
pending on the characteristics of a given clinical case. The 
physician agent is devoted to data acquisition, after roamin
g in the networks to collect related physiological data of pat
ients. Eventually, the physician agent carries the collected i
nformation with it and returns to the medical staff’s devices. 
 
3.2.4 Diagnostic Agent 
 
The diagnostic agent is another type of stationary 
agent. In the proposed platform, the diagnostic agent can be 
considered a data-analyzed engine. It is capable of 
analyzing collection of short-term changes and health status 
data of patients. The main task of diagnostic agent is to (1) 
identify receive patterns from patients (2) indicate or 
predict a sudden change in patients’status. After detecting 
the collected data, the diagnostic will supply medical staff 
with the periodic information. If detecting abnormalities in 
collected data, the diagnostic agent will send to medical 
staff with emergency information via the external services. 
The next step, when it comes to some critical life-death 
situations, it will provide patients with needed automation 
assistance (e.g., call ambulance). 
 
3.2.5 Knowledge-based Data Server  
 
Efficient and effective patients monitoring is a 
complex endeavor that is highly dependent on 
disseminating time-critical information (Lee et al., 2000). 
The time-critical information involves not only the records 
of patients’ conditions but also knowledge sharing of 
expertise and medical practices. The physiological data 
collected by physician agent are the results of observation 
or examination forming the basis of further diagnoses and 
therapies. Each patient is an individual case with individual 
patterns, complications, and disease. Therefore, the 
knowledge-based data server is considered in this section in 
order to promote the performance of the proposed platform. 
The knowledge-base data server is split into two main 
information repositories: (1) PatientStatus and (2) 
PatientProfiles. These two repositories are the storage units 
that are utilized to deposit the physiological information 
collected by physician agent. The “PatientStatus”repository 
involves every monitoring physiological data from patients 
(e.g. HR, SpO2, etc). The “PatientProfiles”repository 
contains up-to-date electronic records for patients: the 
limits of monitored parameter values and some basic 
information of patients. When user agent delivers 
patients’monitoring data to resource agent, the resource 
agent stores the data in the “PatientStatus”repository; at the 
same time, it copies these data and sends to diagnostic 
agent. The diagnostic agent will analyze 
patients’physiological information in real time. 
 
3.2.6 External services  
 
The external services will be initiated by diagnostic a
gent after analyzing the incoming physiological data of pati
ents. The external services embrace the hardware and servic
es in the platform including E-
mail and short message services (SMS), etc. It is an extensi
ble component varied on different scenario of applications. 
The result of the physiological data analysis is the predictio
n for diagnostic agent to consider while determining the pro
vision of next action for medical staff. If the prediction of t
he patient’s signals results in abnormal situation, the diagno
stic agent will take proper actions such as issuing an alert m
essage according to the analyzed outcomes. Moreover, if so
me emergency situation of patients occurs, the external serv
ice for automatically dialing ambulance is going to be launc
hed. 
 
4. Conclusion  
 
Multi-agent systems have a set of properties that make 
them suitable for use in solving the many problems that are 
encountered in the healthcare domain. In previous studies, 
as described in Section 2.4, many agent technologies have 
been applied in the healthcare field. Nevertheless, not all 
existing multi-agent systems can provide good solutions for 
the healthcare monitoring domain. In this research, we have 
developed a MADIP system based on the JADE platform to 
address the specific requirements of a distributed healthcare 
environment. From the different aspects of usage 
requirements, MADIP provides different functions to cater 
to each user. From the viewpoint of the medical staff, the 
workload is reduced by the substitution of routine patient-
supervision tasks. Using a personal device, medical staff 
can, at any time and from any location, view the vital signs 
of patients, who are generally widely spread across many 
locations. Furthermore, in MADIP, the diagnostic agent 
substitutes for a physician, performing the first step of 
diagnosis. While from the point of view the patients, patient 
care is improved by the immediate transits as well as by the 
communication between agents, which provide more 
reliable information, delivered in a more convenient 
manner. From the viewpoint of the system, MADIP 
provides a patient monitoring environment that is simple 
and efficient. Furthermore, it provides a ready exchange of 
information, and as permanent data is collected only once, 
less time is spent in searching for mislaid data, thereby 
increasing efficiency. The communication via asynchronous
