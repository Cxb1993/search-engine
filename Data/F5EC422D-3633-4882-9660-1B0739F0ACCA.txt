In addition, the preference and competitiveness of 
metal ions were also studied to understand the possible 
kinetic and adsorption models. 
2. Experimental materials and methods 
In this study, CNTs were grown on the surface of 
micro-sized a-Al,O, particles. Before growth of CNTs, 
Fe-Ni nanoparticles were deposited on the surface of 
A1203 particles as catalysts by the electroless plating 
method. The growth of CNTs on Al,O, (denoted by 
CNTs/Al,O, hereafter) was performed in CH4 atmos- 
phere at 700°C [20-211. The as-grown CNTs/Al,O, 
(without further treatment or oxidation) was used as 
adsorbent for adsorption of Pb2+, Cu2+, and Cd2+ from 
water. The adsorption capacity of composite 
CNTs/A120, and those of active carbon powders 
(Merk), commercial multi-wall CNTs (Conyuan 
MWCNTs 2040), and a-A1203 particles were com- 
pared and analyzed, and the composite CNTs/AI,O, 
were used to adsorb heavy metal ions from aqueous 
solutions. 
Before adsorption test, adsorbents were character- 
ized by various methods. The specific area was deter- 
mined using the BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) 
method (Micrornetrics ASAP-20 10). The surface mor- 
phology was observed using a field emission scanning 
electron microscope (FESEM) (JEOL JSM-6700 F) 
operated at 20 kV. The microstructure and crystallinity 
were investigated using a transmission electron micro- 
scope (TEM) (JEOL JEM-2010) operated at 200 kV. 
The phases were analyzed using an X-ray diffraction 
meter (XRD) (Siemens, D5000). 
Several adsorption tests were performed in this 
study: for single/dual and three metal ion adsorption, 
for equilibrium adsorption, for the effect of different 
solution pHs, and for the effect of adsorbent amount on 
the adsorption. 
For the test of single metal ion adsorption, Pb2+ so- 
lution with a concentration of 5-40 mg/L, Cu2+ solution 
with a concentration of 2-25 mg/L, and Cd2+ solution 
with a concentration of 2- 15 mg/L were prepared from 
nitrate salts respectively. In each single metal ion ad- 
sorption test, 0.05 g of adsorbent was used for 100 mL 
of ion solution. The ion solution with adsorbent was 
vibrated on a rotary vibrator (TS-580 batch shaker) for 
4 h [20]. 
For the test of equilibrium adsorption, Pb2+, Cu2+, 
and Cd2+ solutions of 40 mg/L were prepared from ni- 
trate respectively. The pH values of all solutions were 
adjusted to 5 by 0.1 moVL HNO, and 0.1 moVL NaOH. 
An adsorbent of 0.1 g was put into 200 mL of ion solu- 
tion. The vibration time for various samples is 30, 60, 
120, 180,240,300, and 360 min, respectively. 
For the test of the effect of pH value on adsorption, 
Pb2+, Cu2+, and Cd2+ solutions of 40 mg/L were pre- 
pared from nitrate respectively. The pH values of vari- 
ous solutions were adjusted from 2 to 11 respectively. 
An adsorbent of 0.1 g was added to each solution of 
100 mL. Each solution with the adsorbent was vibrated 
for 4 h. 
For the test of the adsorbent amount’s effect on ad- 
sorption, Pb2+, Cu2+, and Cd2+ solutions of 40 mg/L 
were prepared from nitrate. An adsorbent of 0.05,0.1, 
0.15, 0.2, 0.25, and 0.3 g was added to various solu- 
tions of 100 mL respectively. Vibration time for all 
solutions is 4 h. 
For all tests, the concentrations of metal ions in the 
solution were measured before and after adsorption 
using an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission 
spectrometer (ICP-AES) (GBC Integra XMP) and the 
adsorbed amount of heavy metal was calculated from 
the concentration of these metal ions. 
3. Results and discussion 
The FESEM image of CNTs/Al,O, is shown in Fig. 
1. It is clear that the as-grown CNTs on Al,03 are cur- 
ved and tangled with each other and about 30-80 nm in 
diameter and several micrometers in length. The TEM 
image of CNTs on Al,O, is shown in Fig. 2, where 
multi-walled CNTs with Fe-Ni nanoparticles were 
identified using TEM/EDS on the tips of CNT. The 
mass ratio for CNTs, Fe-Ni nanoparticles, and A1203 
was determined to be at 32wt%, 12wt%, and 56wt%, 
respectively [20]. 
The XRD diagram in Fig. 3 shows that there are a- 
A120,, CNTs, and FeNi phases in the composite 
CNTs/Al,O,. The specific areas of A1203 particles, ac- 
tive carbon powders, commercial CNTs, and 
CNTs/Al,O, are determined to be 9.13, 815.69, 95.68, 
and 18.61 m2/g, respectively [20]. And, the specific 
area of CNTs alone increases to 66.85 m2/g from 18.61 
m2/g of composite CNTs/A1,03. This area is rather 
small when compared to 95.68 m2/g of commercial 
CNTs and 815.69 m2/g of activated carbon. 
The results of equilibrium adsorption tests are 
shown in Figs. 4(a)-(d) for A120, particles, active car- 
bon powders, commercial CNTs, and CNTs/A1,03, re- 
spectively. In Fig. 4, the abscissa denotes time (in min- 
utes) of adsorption and the ordinate (qe) denotes the 
metal weight (in mg) adsorbed by 1 g of adsorbent in 
the given adsorption periods. These results show that 
almost all the adsorbed metal amounts have nearly

To further understand this phenomenon, a sedimen- 
tation test for CNTs/Al,O, and commercial CNTs in 
deionized water was performed. After 2 min of sedi- 
mentation, commercial CNTs quickly settled down and 
CNTs/Al,O, remained mixed in solution as shown in 
Fig. 6. This phenomenon implied that the commercial

CNTs were easy to agglomerate and settle so that they 
have a lesser opportunity to adsorb metal ions in solu- 
tions, compared to the CNTs/A120,. Other researchers 
did not present their CNTs with similar dispersion 
property in water solution as this study had demon- 
strated.

The adsorption of Pb+2, CU+~,  and Cd+2 from water 
by CNTs/Al,O,, commercial CNTs, active carbon 
powders, and A1203 particles can be assumed to have a 
behavior fitting with the isothermal adsorption model 
that is the adsorbate keeps a dynamic equilibrium be- 
tween the adsorption and desorption at a fixed tem- 
perature. For the isothermal adsorption model, there 
are some adsorption isotherms as follows. 
Langmuir isotherm: 
1 1  1 -=--+- 
qe q m  4mKeCe' 
Freundlich isotherm:

qe = KfCL' 7 
And BET isotherm: 
where qe (in mg/g) is the adsorbate amount adsorbed 
by 1 g of absorbent, Ce (in mg/g) is  the equilibrium 
concentration of adsorbate in the solution, qm (in mg/g) 
is the saturation amount of the adsorbate adsorbed by 
one gram of absorbent, and K e  , Kf , n, P, and Cs are 
constants. The results of single metal ion adsorptions of 
Pb2+, Cu2+, and Cd2+ adsorbed by A120, particles, active 
carbon powders, commercial CNTs and CNT/A1203, as 
shown in Figs. 5(a)-(d) were tried to fit these adsorp- 
tion isotherms and their results were shown in Tables 1 
and 2. From the values of coefficient of determination 
(R2), the Langmuir isotherm is the best model for all 
absorbents in this study. This means that the adsorbates 
containing Pb2+, Cu2+, and Cd2+ were adsorbed in such a 
manner that only one atomic layer of adsorbate can be 
adsorbed and distributed uniformly on the surface of

Note: 1 represents active carbon powders, 2 represents commercial CNTs. 
The amount of heavy metal adsorbed by adsorbent is 
greatly affected by the pH value of solution. Figs. 
7(a)-(c) show the effect of pH value of solution on the 
amounts of Pb2+, Cu2+, and Cd2+ adsorbed by 
CNTs/A1203, commercial CNTs, active carbon pow- 
ders, and A1203 particles respectively. In Fig. 7, the or- 
dinate is the removal ratio (%) which is defined as the 
ratio of difference in concentration before and after ad- 
sorption to the concentration before adsorption. The 
removal ratio (9%) is in general increased with an in- 
crease in pH value for all adsorbates and adsorbents. 
The pH value is 6.6 for CNTs/A1203, 6.8 for commer- 
cial CNTs, 7.6 for active carbon powders, and 8.2 for 
A1203 as 50% of CdZ+ is removed. The pH value is 6.4, 
6.3, 6.7, and 8.1 for CNTs/A1,03, commercial CNTs, 
active carbon powders, and A1203 particles respectively 
as 50% of Pb2+ is removed. It is worthy to note that 
Cd(OH)2, Cu(OH),, and Pb(OH), begin to precipitate at 
pH of 9,9.4, and 9, respectively. 
Figs. 8(a)-(c) show the removal ratio of Pb2+, Cuz+, 
and Cd2' by various amounts of adsorbents, respec- 
tively. The removal ratio for all the adsorbates and ad- 
sorbents is in general increased with an increase in the 
amount of adsorbent. Among the removal ratio of Cd2+ 
by various adsorbents from 0.05 to 0.3 g, CNTs/A1,03 
is the largest, A1203 is the smallest, commercial CNTs 
and active carbon powders are almost at a same level.

cleaning, the Al2O3 particles are sensitized in sensitiza-
tion solution (SnCl2 + HCl) and then are activated in
activation solution (PdCl2 + HCl). After sensitization and
activation, a film of Fe–Ni nanoparticles can be electro-
lessly deposited on the Al2O3 particles in an aqueous
solution containing Fe2+ and Ni2+ ions. The composition
of the electroless plating bath and the operation param-
eters of electroless deposition are listed in Table I.
The Al2O3 particles, on the surface of which had been
deposited a film of Fe–Ni nanoparticles, were heated to
700 °C and held at this temperature for half an hour in a
N2 atmosphere with a flow rate of 120 cc/min. The N2
atmosphere was then replaced by CH4 gas, the flow rate
of which was also 120 cc/min. In the CH4 atmosphere
CNTs were grown on the surface of Al2O3 particles with
the Fe–Ni nanoparticles as catalysts. The characteristics
of CNTs, Fe–Ni nanoparticles, and Al2O3 were measured
and observed by electron microscopy for morphology,
the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method for special
surface area and Zeta potential test for surface charge.
The individual and competitive adsorption capacities
of Pb2+, Cu2+, and Cd2+ from water by CNTs on Al2O3
particles were studied. All adsorption experiments were
carried out in aqueous solutions containing Pb2+, Cu2+,
and Cd2+at room temperature and pH 5. In single metal
ion adsorption experiments, the concentrations of adsor-
bent (CNTs on Al2O3 particles), Pb2+, Cu2+, and Cd2+
were 500 mg/l, 5–60 mg/l, 2–30 mg/l, and 2–20 mg/l,
respectively. In competitive adsorption experiments, the
concentration of adsorbent was 1000 mg/l and Pb2+,
Cu2+, and Cd2+ had equal initial concentration, from
2.5 × 10−5 to 1.0 × 10−3 mol/l. The contents of Pb2+,
Cu2+, and Cd2+ in solutions were measured by GBC
Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectrometer (ICP-OES,
Melbourne, Australia).
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Fe–Ni nanoparticles deposited on Al2O3 particles are
shown in Fig. 1. The plating time of this sample was
10 min, so only sparse Fe–Ni nanoparticles about 10–
40 nm in size [identified by energy dispersion spectrum
in a transmission electron microscope (TEM)] were de-
posited on the surface of Al2O3 particles. Some clusters
of CNTs are shown in Fig. 2. Because the CNTs were
grown on Al2O3 particles under the catalysis of Fe–Ni
nanoparticles, the CNTs could cluster around Al2O3 par-
ticles. Figure 3 is the TEM image of CNTs, on the tips of
which are Fe–Ni nanoparticles. It shows clearly that the
growth mechanism of CNTs on Al2O3 particles with Fe–
Ni nanoparticles as catalysts was “top growth.” The
CNTs grown on the surface of Al2O3 particles were
curved and tangled with each other and had multiwalled

and the correlation coefficients R2 for the individual and
competitive adsorption of Pb2+, Cu2+, and Cd2+ from
aqueous solution by CNTs on Al2O3 particles. The maxi-
mum adsorption capacities of Pb2+, Cu2+, and Cd2+are
62.50, 27.03, and 9.30 mg/g for individual adsorption
and 37.7, 20.3, and 7.5 mg/g for competitive adsorption,
respectively. Table III lists the maximum adsorption ca-
pacities qm of Pb2+, Cu2+, and Cd2+ for our CNTs and
some other adsorbents.4–7,31,32 It is clearly shown that
under the same condition of adsorption test, excepting
surface oxidized CNTs2 and sawdust43 (only for Cd2+),
the qm values of Pb2+, Cu2+, and Cd2+ by our as-grown
CNTs are much larger than those by as-grown CNTs,39
SiN2,41 granular active carbon,42 powder active carbon,42
sawdust,43 and fly ash.45 The surface-oxidized CNTs2
are superior to ours in adsorption capacity because their
surface has relatively many functional groups for adsorp-
tion due to oxidization. Although the as-grown CNTs on
Al2O3 of this work was not treated by any oxidization,
they still possessed quite good performance for adsorp-
tion of heavy metal ions from water. This property can be
attributed to the following causes: (i) Because the CNTs
were attached to the Al2O3 particle, the chance for con-
tact with each other was less than others. Therefore, the
CNTs on Al2O3 particles have larger surface for adsorp-
tion. (ii) As shown in Fig. 3, the CNTs of this work are
curved and have uneven surfaces. On the surfaces of curved
of CNTs, many defects exist, such as heptagon, pentagon,
stacking fault due to folding or fracture of the lattice
planes,45,46 and amorphous carbons, etc. These defects be-
come the activated sites for adsorption of heavy metal ions.
IV. CONCLUSION
Multi-walled carbon nanotubes with Fe–Ni nanopar-
ticles on their tips can be grown on the micro-sized
Al2O3 particles under the catalysis of Fe–Ni nanopar-
ticles in CH4 atmosphere at 700 °C.
The adsorption behavior of Pb2+, Cu2+, and Cd2+ from
aqueous solution by as-grown CNTs on Al2O3 particles
is in good agreement with the Langmuir adsorption
model. The maximum individual adsorption capacities
of Pb2+, Cu2+, and Cd2+ from aqueous solution by
as-grown CNTs on Al2O3 particles are 62.50, 27.03, and
9.30 mg/g, respectively, which are comparable to those
published in some other research. The adsorption mecha-
nism of heavy metal ions from water on the as-grown
CNTs on Al2O3 particles is believed to be the simple
surface adsorption, especially surface defect adsorption.
The CNTs grown on micro-sized Al2O3 particles in this
study have promising potential for removal of heavy
metals from wastewater.
