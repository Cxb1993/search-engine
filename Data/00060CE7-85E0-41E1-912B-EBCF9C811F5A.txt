1. INTRODUCTION 
The Fourier law is often applied in heat conduction for various branches of 
science and engineering problems. Most of these problems are described and analyzed 
with a parabolic heat conduction model, which states the relation between the heat 
flux and the temperature gradient. 
The usual theory of thermal conduction, based on the Fourier law, implies an 
immediate response to a temperature gradient and leads to a parabolic differential 
equation for the evolution of the temperature. In contrast, when relaxation effects are 
taken into account in the constitutive equation describing the heat flux, one has a 
hyperbolic equation which implies a finite speed for heat transport.  
Hyperbolic heat transport has been receiving increasing attention both for 
theoretical motivations (analysis of thermal waves and finite speed of heat transport, 
etc.) and for the analysis of some practical problems involving a fast supply of 
thermal energy (for instance, by a laser pulse or a chemical explosion, etc.). 
Cattaneo [1] and Vernotte [2] suggested the hyperbolic heat equation model 
for the heat transfer with a finite propagation speed, the hyperbolic heat equation is 
often employed to study the temperature fields and related heat transfer quantities in 
transient heat flow in an extremely short period of time, very high temperature 
gradient, or for very low temperatures near absolute zero (Ozisik and Tzou [3]). 
Solving this equation may encounter some mathematical difficulties that must be 
precluded for obtaining an admissible solution. 
The mathematical difficulties may arise when a wave front encounters a 
boundary or another temperature discontinuity. Various numerical methods [4–10] 
have been proposed to solve the hyperbolic heat conduction problems under different 
 5
for a three-dimensional inverse heat conduction problem. Huang and Chen [18] used 
same technique in estimating surface heat fluxes for a three-dimensional inverse heat 
convection problem. Huang and Chin [19] used CGM in a two-dimensional inverse 
problem of imaging the thermal conductivity of a non-homogeneous medium. Huang 
[20] applied the CGM in a non-linear inverse vibration problem in estimating the 
unknown external forces for a system with displacement-dependent parameters. 
For this reason the objective of the present inverse study is to utilize the CGM 
in the similar problem as was examined by Yang [14], and the goal is to avoid the 
drawbacks and to improve the accuracy of the inverse solutions.   
The CGM is also called an iterative regularization method, which means the 
regularization procedure is performed during the iterative processes and thus the 
determination of optimal regularization conditions is not needed. The conjugate 
gradient method derives from the perturbation principles and transforms the inverse 
problem to the solution of three problems, namely, the direct, sensitivity and the 
adjoint problem, which will be discussed in detail in the following few sections. 
 
2. THE DIRECT PROBLEM 
To illustrate the methodology for developing expressions for use in determining 
unknown surface heat flux in an inverse hyperbolic problem, the following slab 
problem with thickness l and constant thermal properties is considered. The initial 
temperature equals to T0. When t > 0, the boundary condition at boundary x = 0 is 
assumed insulated, while an unknown heat flux q(t) is applied at x = l.  
 The dimensional mathematical formulation of this linear hyperbolic heat 
conduction problem is given by:

4. CONJUGATE GRADIENT METHOD FOR MINIMIZATION 
The following iterative process based on the conjugate gradient method [15] is 
now used for the estimation of unknown heat flux q(l,t) by minimizing the functional 
J[q(l,t)] 
 
n 1 n n nq (l, t) q (l, t) P (l, t)        for  n = 0,1,2,........ (3a) 
  
where n  is the search step size in going from iteration n to iteration n+1, and Pn(l,t) 
is the direction of descent (i.e. search direction) given by  
 
n  n n n 1P (l, t) J (l, t) P (l, t)     (3b) 
which is a conjugation of the gradient direction ' nJ (l, t)  at iteration n and the 
direction of descent  P
n-1
(l,t) at iteration n-1. The conjugate coefficient is 
determined from

 with 0 = 0 (3c) 
It is noted that when  n 0  for any n, in equation (3b), the direction of 
descent P
n
(l,t) becomes the gradient direction, i.e. the "Steepest descent" method is 
obtained. The convergence of the above iterative procedure in minimizing the 
functional J is guaranteed in [21]. 
To perform the iterations according to equations (3a), a step size n  and the 
gradient of the functional ' nJ (l, t)  need to be computed. In order to develop 
expressions for the determination of these two quantities, a "sensitivity problem" and 
an "adjoint problem" are constructed as described below.

where nT(0,t;q )  is the solution of the direct problem by using estimate heat flux for 
exact q(l,t) at x = 0 and time t. The sensitivity functions nT(0,t;P ) are taken as the 
solutions of problem (4) at the measured position x = 0 and time t by letting q Pn . 
The search step size n  is determined by minimizing the functional given by 
equation (5b) with respect to n . The following expression results:

4-2. ADJOINT PROBLEM AND GRADIENT EQUATION 
To obtain the adjoint problem, equation (1a) is multiplied by the Lagrange 
multiplier (or adjoint function) (x,t) and the resulting expression is integrated over 
the corresponding space and time domains. Then the result is added to the right hand 
side of equation (2) to yield the following expression for the functional J[q(l,t)]: 
  ft 2

         (7) 
The variation J is obtained by perturbing q by q and T by T in equation (7), 
subtracting the resulting expression from the original equation (7) and neglecting the 
second-order terms. We thus find 
  ft

4-3.  STOPPING CRITERION 
If the problem contains no measurement errors, the traditional check condition 
is specified as  
n 1J [q (l, t)]       (12a) 
where  is a small-specified number. However, the measured temperature data must 
contain measurement errors. Therefore, we do not expect the functional equation (2) 
to be equal to zero at the final iteration step. Following the experiences of the authors 
[15-20], the discrepancy principle is used as the stopping criterion, i.e. it is assumed 
that the temperature residuals may be approximated by 
 
T(0,t) Y(0,t)       (12b) 
where  is the standard deviation of the measurements, which is assumed to be a 
constant. Substituting equation (12b) into equation (2), the following expression is 
obtained for stopping criteria : 
2
f   t     (12c) 
Then, the stopping criterion is given by equation (12a) with determined from 
equation (12c). 
 
5. COMPUTATIONAL PROCEDURE 
The computational procedure for the solution of this inverse hyperbolic heat 
conduction problem using conjugate gradient method may be summarized as follows: 
Suppose nq (l, t)  is available at iteration n. 
Step 1. Solve the direct problem given by equation (1) for T(x,t). 
Step 2. Examine the stopping criterion given by equation (12a) with given by  
 equation (12c). Continue if not satisfied. 
Step 3. Solve the adjoint problem given by equation (9) for (x,t). 
Step 4. Compute the gradient of the functional J  from equation (11). 
Step 5. Compute the conjugate coefficient nand direction of descent Pn from 
 13
central difference [4] is shown in Figure 1. The numerical solution is indeed accurate 
when comparing with the exact solution shown in reference [4]. Moreover, the 
oscillatory behavior for the numerical solution reported in reference [14] is greatly 
improved. This implies that more reliable inverse solution can be obtained by using 
the present numerical scheme. Finally the verification of our numerical program for 
direct problem is thus completed. 
To illustrate the accuracy of the conjugate gradient method in predicting 
boundary heat flux q(l,t) with the present inverse analysis from the knowledge of 
transient temperature recordings, three specific examples having different form of 
heat fluxes are considered here. 
In order to compare the results for situations involving random measurement 
errors, a normally distributed uncorrelated error with zero mean and constant standard 
deviation are considered. The simulated inexact measurement data Y can be 
expressed as  
Y = Yexact +  (14) 
where Yexact is the solution of the direct problem with an exact boundary heat flux 
q(l,t); is the standard deviation of the measurements; and  is a random variable 
that generated by subroutine DRNNOR of the IMSL [22] and will be within -2.576 to 
2.576 for a 99% confidence bound.  
One of the advantages of using the conjugate gradient method to solve the 
inverse problems is that the initial guesses of the unknown quantities can be chosen 
arbitrarily. In all the test cases considered here the initial guesses of q(l,t) is taken as 
q(l,t)initial = 0.0.  
The following computational parameters are chosen for the numerical 
experiments: 
T0 = 20 oC;  l = 0.035 m;  k = 50 Wm-2;   = k/c = 0.00001327 m2s-1 
Here  is the thermal diffusivity of the material. Besides, the space and time 
increments used in numerical calculations are taken as x = 0.00035 m (i.e. 100 grid 
points in space) and t = 2.0 s (i.e. 300 grid points for tf = 600 seconds). We now

  (16b) 
here J represents the index of discreted time, while qˆ(l,J) and T(0,J) denote the 
estimated values of heat flux and temperature, respectively. Some adjacent points to 
the zero value for both heat flux and temperature are neglected in calculating the 
relative error to avoid unreasonable computations. For this reason, M1 and M2 are 
chosen as 265 and 275, respectively in test case 1. 
Next, let us discuss the influence of the measurement errors on the inverse 
solutions. First, the measurement error for the temperatures measured by sensor is 
taken as  = 10 oC (about 4.5 % of the average measured temperature), then error is 
increased to  = 20 oC (about 9 % of the average measured temperature). The 
stopping criterion  is calculated from equation (12c) and the number of iterations is 9 
for both inexact measurement test cases. The estimated q(S1,t) with time are shown in 
Figures 3a and 4a, where the relative average errors in Figure 3a is ERR1 = 4.89 % 
and in Figure 4a is ERR1 = 5.43 %. The measured and estimated temperature 
distributions for  = 10 oC and 20 oC  are plotted in Figures 3b and 4b, respectively. 
The results imply that the present algorithm is not sensitive to the measurement error 
and the reliable inverse solutions can still be obtained when measurement errors are 
considered.  
(B). Numerical test case 2 
The unknown boundary heat flux q(l,t) is assumed as the combination of two 
triangular shapes:

 (18) 
By assuming  = 1.0, t = 2 s, = 0.0 and choosing  = 5000, the inverse 
solution for q(l,t) can be obtained after 14 iterations and is shown in Figure 8a. It is 
clear from Figure 8a that good estimation is obtained for the heat flux except for the 
sharp discontinuity and again the phase error do not appear by using the technique of 
CGM. The measured and estimated temperatures at x = 0 are plotted in Figure 8b.  
The average relative errors for estimated heat flux and temperatures are 
calculated as ERR1 = 5.60 % and ERR2 = 0.66 %, respectively. Here M1 and M2 are 
chosen as 285 and 290, respectively in test case 3. 
The influence of the measurement errors on the inverse solutions is then 
considered. The measurement error for the temperatures is firstly taken as  = 10 oC 
(about 2.1 % of the average measured temperature), then error is increased to  = 20 
oC (about 4.2 % of the average measured temperature). The number of iterations for  
= 10 oC and 20 oC are 9 and 6, respectively. The estimated q(S1,t) with time are 
shown in Figures 9a and 10a, and the relative average errors in Figures 9a and 10a are 
obtained as ERR1 = 7.98 % and 14.47 %, respectively. The measured and estimated 
temperature distributions for  = 10 oC and 20 oC  are plotted in Figures 9b and 10b, 
respectively.  
From the above three test cases it can be learned that an inverse hyperbolic 
heat conduction problem in estimating time-dependent boundary heat flux is now 
completed. Reliable estimations can be obtained without any phase errors [14] when 
using either exact or error measurements.
