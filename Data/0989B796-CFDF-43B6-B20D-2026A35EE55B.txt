these spurious responses, and novel designs proposed to correct the mentioned deficiency 
have been documented in literatures and in related books [5, 6].  
The wiggly-line structure with a second harmonic sinusoidal perturbation to the 
parallel-coupled line section for eliminating the corresponding spurious response is reported 
in [7].  Next, capacitive compensation methods [8] are applied in circuits to equalize the 
odd- and even-mode velocity in order to reject the unwanted harmonic resonance. These two 
methods are ingenious for a coupled-line filter design; nevertheless, they are too complicate 
to fit in a fast design procedure. A much simpler way to solve this problem is to use an 
over-coupled structure by attaching an extension line at the end of the coupled stage to 
increase the propagating length of the odd-mode without changing the path for the 
even-mode [9, 10]. Namely, the intent length can make the odd- and even-mode signal arrive 
at the same time in the coupled section to suppress the spurious response at double 
fundamental resonance frequency. However, design procedure for this method is not 
elucidative in literatures. The foregoing three categories have a common drawback that 
usually one spurious mode suppression can be achieved. 
In our purpose, we firstly provide a useful design method of a one-stage hybrid 
over/under-coupled bandpass filter and a creative and promotive folded topology with 
multiple harmonics suppression. The proposed method achieves a much wider 20-dB 
rejection bandwidth (compares to those in previous works) from suppressing three harmonics 
in only one-stage. After that, we apply this design procedure to design a sampled 2.4/3-GHz 
(Tx/Rx) diplexer with extra wide stop bandwidth. In this paper, the filter’s and diplexer’s 
design parameters are given and good agreement between EM simulations and measurements 
is observed.  
       Chap. 2  Hybrid-Coupled Structure 
The Chebyshev function synthesis of one-stage hybrid over/under coupled filter, as 
illustrated in Fig. 1, can be regarded as a transmutation of the parallel-coupled filter. In our 
design, the central frequency is mainly determined by the dimension of line B. Moreover, the 
input line (line A) and output line (line C) are designed to be an over and an under 
quarter-wavelength-coupled structure, respectively, at the designed fundamental frequency. 
An additional length of line (termed as ovl) is extended from the coupled input line and a 
section of line (denoted by uvl) is removed from the coupled output line underneath in the 
proposed filter structure. Here, the ovl and uvl cause an over and under coupling phenomenon, 
respectively, at the designed central frequency (fc). The former is for the purpose of spurious 
response elimination occurred at the second harmonic frequency, 2fc. The latter, although 
bears the name of under-coupling, has an over-coupled effect at the frequency of the third 
harmonic, thus can reject the signal of 3fc. The dimensions of ovl and uvl are appropriately 
chosen to have the even- and odd-mode propagating length being equal when either operating 
at frequencies of the second or the third harmonic, and results in the suppression of these 
spurious responses. 
To accurately predict the length for over-coupled and under-coupled section, the separated 
characteristic impedances for odd- and even-mode are calculated from [6]. After performing 
the impedance calculations, the phase velocity for odd- and even-mode can be computed as

In the 2.4 GHz Tx filter design, the dark solid curve in Fig. 4 provides the frequency 
variation of the filter’s third zero due to its dimension changes with the folded length, d, as a 
major parameter. The length of line B is fixed to secure the stability of the midband frequency, 
and the gap between lines is 0.44 mm. The length of line A and C is slightly different from 
those of Table I due to the folding effect. The values of parameters, l1, and l2 of Fig. 3, can be 
read from the right vertical axes of Fig. 4, the dimension p (which indicates the overlap 
between the coupled input and output lines) can be found from the right axis, and the left axis 
reveals the frequencies of the zeroes accordingly. The simulated curves in Fig. 4 are obtained 
from extensive simulations under the constraint that the fundamental frequency and the 
frequencies of the first and second zero are remained nearly invariable.  
From observing Fig. 4, the tuning range for the third zero due to the structure folding effect 
is about 700 MHz. A set of this folded structure’s parameters which used to suppress an 
additional harmonic can be found from the design curves provided in Fig. 4. For example, the 
filter has its third harmonic at 9.68 GHz needed to be eliminated. Then d is read from Fig. 4 
having a value of 8.57 mm. The rest parameters are found by drawing a vertical line of d = 
8.57 mm intersecting with the other corresponding curves. Performing the described 
procedure leads to l1, l2 and p equal to 5.6 mm, 2.4 mm and 0.12 mm, respectively. The 
procedure also obtains another solution at 9.68 GHz, but that solution is not preferred for 
having smaller values of l1 and l2 resulting in a higher insertion loss due to a weaker coupling. 
Using the same method described, we can speculate the value d of Rx filter to be 6.75 mm for 
eliminating the harmonic at 11.7 GHz. The parameters l1, l2 and p are then obtained as 4.28 
mm, 2 mm and 0.21 mm, respectively. As a result of this folded topology, the simulated data 
shown in Fig. 5 have extended the high-end side 20-dB rejection bandwidth to 11.1 GHz for 
the folded Tx filter, and the one is beyond 12 GHz for the Rx filter. 
Fig. 6 shows the measured and simulated frequency response of a folded Tx filter for 
comparison. The experimental circuit is built on a RT/Duroid 6010 substrate with thickness 
of 0.635 mm. The relative permittivity and loss tangent of the substrate is 10.2 and 0.0023, 
respectively.  It is observed that the three spurious responses are successfully suppressed, 
and the 20-dB rejection stop bandwidth is as wide as 9.1 GHz (371%). The measured 
insertion loss is 1.36 dB at 2.44 GHz.  The measurement agrees well with the simulation. 
B. Design of Diplexer  
The sample diplexer layout uses the direct-parallel topology. It is noted that the connection 
line between filters should be the main concern if one craves to get a good performance. In 
this way, the possible deterioration caused by the mutual interference of Tx and Rx blocks 
should be avoided by every means. To avoid the encumbrance between these two blocks, we 
carefully choose the length of connection line l3 and l4, as shown in Fig. 7.  Each of 
branched impedances looking from the common port of Fig. 7 should be functioned as an 
open circuit to the other to diminish to interference mutual to the filters. For example, to 
obtain the proper length of l3, we firstly consider the Rx block together with the connecting 
line l3 as a load to the Tx block stemmed from the input terminal. And then, choose the proper 
l3 length to effectively make the branched load (the Rx block) an open circuit at Tx central 
frequency looking from the branch terminal. In this way the effect of the Rx block can be 
minimized. The length is calculated to be 6.42 mm. Similarly, l4 is found in the same way 
which leads to the value of 4.65 mm. It might be worth mentioned that this feed line design 
successfully avoid the potential deterioration caused by the mutual interference between two 
blocks of diplexer. 
A verification diplexer circuit is built on a RT/Duroid 6010 substrate with thickness of 
0.635 mm. The measured results are given in Fig. 8. Table II gives the summary of the

2. Design of the Quarter-Wavelength SIR Filter 
In view of having the same central frequency, the typical half- (with one shorting end) and quarter-wavelength 
SIR (with both ends open) shown in Fig. 1(a) are taken into consideration for building a reduced size BPFs. 
Shown in Fig. 1(b) is the equivalent circuit model of Fig. 1(a). These mentioned λ/2 SIR is formed by two 
identical microstrip lines sandwiching an unequal width microstrip line. The SIR is bent to a hairpin shape for 
saving the circuit space. The SIR is then split up into two λ/4 SIRs by shorting its middle point to ground 
through a metallic via hole. For a half-wavelength uniform width resonator, the spurious responses should occur 
around (n+1)f0, where n = 1, 2, 3, …. On the contrary, the spurious responses of quarter-wavelength one will 
arise at (2n+1)f0. The later one seizes more attractions with its wider rejection bandwidth accounting for the first 
spurious that appears at 3f0, which results in a wider stopband bandwidth. 
         
(a)                          (b) 
Fig. 1. (a) the structure of the quarter-wavelength SIRs BPF and (b) its equivalent circuit model. 
Shown in Fig. 1(a), the U-shape enhanced coupling feed, which has a better coupling effect and lower 
insertion losses than those of the conventional parallel-coupled lines. The separation space (denoted by s) 
between the two U-shape structures can provide a direct coupling between the input and output ports. The 
strength of the direct coupling (also called a cross-coupling) can be managed by adjusting the separation distance 
s. This cross-coupling together with the via hole result in the quasi-elliptic response of the proposed filter. The 
dimension of the via diameter is founded to be inversely proportional to the value of the shunt inductance in Fig. 
1(b), and can be used to tune the coupling between the two connected λ/4 SIRs. The tapping position, d, should 
be carefully chosen to match the circuit’s loaded Q factor, and it is also fine tuned to eliminate the filter’s 
spurious response. Three transmission zeros can be created and predicted by the equivalent circuit model. The 
first two zeros are allocated by each side of the passband to enhance the filter’s signal selectivity.   
The positions of these created zeros are primarily dominated by the lumped elements C1, C2, and CSL of Fig. 
1(b), which physically count for the coupling capacitances between each U-shape structure and the SIR, and the 
coupling one between the two U-shape structures. Shown in Fig. 2 are the simulated frequency responses 
obtained from using the equivalent circuit model of Fig. 1(b) and the full wave electromagnetic simulator, IE3D. 
The lumped elements in Fig. 2 have the values of C1 = C2 = 0.16 pF, CSL = 0.0175 pF, and Lv = 0.08134 nH. The 
electrical length θt is equal to 168o. It is observed that this equivalent model can exactly simulate the filter’s 
frequency response and predict the filter’s characteristics.
