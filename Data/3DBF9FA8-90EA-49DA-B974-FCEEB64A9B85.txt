phenomenon”, in which the attractive electrostatic force induced by the external voltage 
exceeds the restoring force developed within the deflected membrane and causes it to 
collapse and make a momentary contact with the lower electrode. The voltage at which 
this phenomenon takes place is referred to as the “pull-in voltage” and is of critical 
importance in the design of many MEMs-based devices [8]. Generally speaking, the 
dynamic behavior of the micro circular plates used in MEMS electrostatic actuators is not 
easily analyzed using traditional methods such as Galerkin method due to the complexity 
of the interactions between the electrostatic coupling effects. 
Differential transformation theory was originally proposed by Zhao in 1986 as a 
means of solving linear and nonlinear initial value problems in the circuit analysis 
domain. However, in more recent years, researchers have extended its use to the analysis 
of a variety of initial value problems in the mechanical engineering field [9-10]. Chen et 
al. [11] demonstrated that the hybrid method (H.M.) which differential transformation 
and finite difference method provides a precise and computationally-efficient means of 
analyzing the nonlinear dynamic behavior of fixed-fixed micro-beams. The same group 
also used the hybrid method to analyze the nonlinear dynamic response of an 
electrostatically-actuated micro circular plate subject to the effects of residual stress and a 
uniform hydrostatic pressure acting on the upper surface [12]. Finally, Kuo and Chen [13] 
employed the hybrid method (H.M.) which differential transformation and finite 
difference method to solve the nonlinear Burgers’ equation for various values of the 
Reynolds number, including high values. 
In the current study, the hybrid method (H.M.) is employed to analyze the 
electrostatic gap, membrane thickness, membrane radius of the dynamic behavior of the 
micro circular plates by a DC actuating load. In formulating the nonlinear governing 
equation of the circular plate, explicit account is taken of both the hydrostatic pressure 
and the residual stress. The hybrid method can be applied easily and efficiently for 
nonlinear electrostatic behavior to obtain numerical results of the micro circular plate.

Note that ( )W k  and ( )s t  are both non-zero and ( )s t  is analytic in the time domain. The

substrate. The gap between the two plates is filled with air and has an initial height of u . 
The application of an external voltage across the two electrodes creates an electrostatic 
attractive force which causes the micro circular plate to deflect in the downward direction 
toward the lower substrate. The displacement w  of the circular plate is assumed to vary 
as a function of both the radial position r  and the time t, i.e. ( , )w w r t .Due to the 
small physical size of the MEMS actuator system shown in Fig.1, it is essential to take 
the effects of hydrostatic pressure and residual stress into account when modeling the 
pull-in phenomenon. It is supposed that the symmetry deflection of micro circular plate is 
irrelevant to polar coordinate  . Thus, the dynamic governing equation should be 
rewritten as follows [12]:

For analytical convenience, the displacement term u in the governing equation is 
normalized with respect to the initial gap height between the plates, the radial position

hydrostatic force acting on the upper surface of the circular plate and the residual stress 
within the plate itself. In general, the present results have confirmed that the micro 
circular plate becomes structurally unstable at voltages equal to or greater than the pull-in 
voltage and collapses and makes contact with the lower electrode as a result. 
Furthermore, the results have shown that the magnitude of the pull-in voltage reduces as 
the circular plate radius increases due to a loss in structural rigidity. Overall, the results 
have confirmed that the proposed hybrid method scheme represents a computationally 
efficient of predicting the dynamic response of the micro circular plate commonly 
employed in electrostatically actuated MEMS-based devices.
