INTRODUCTION  
Many organic solvents have been used for research and education in laboratories of Taiwanese 
universities and colleges. These volatile organics with low boiling points are typically stored in sealed 
storage cabinets to prevent the unhealthy effects of gaseous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on 
workers. Mobile cabinets with internal circulating adsorption system (Fig. 1) are widely employed to store 
solvents in indoor area. The adsorbent, currently molecular sieves (MS) in Taiwan, must be periodically 
renewed to prevent the over-adsorption of VOC by the adsorbent under breakthrough. However, the 
detailed adsorption characteristics of molecular sieves, used by local manufacturers of storage cabinets, 
have not been thoroughly examined, nor has the adsorption performance been well evaluated.    
Zhao et al.(1) defined that the pore size of the microporous molecular sieve as under 20A. Giaya et al.(2) 
and Erdem- enatalar et al.(3) reported that increasing the SiO2 to Al2O3 (Si/Al) ratio by dealumination 
would change the material from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. Experimentally, the adsorption capacities of 
chloroanillins on montmorillonite and kaolinite sieves depends on the hydrophilicity and lipophilicity of 
adsorbates; that is, the extent of adsorption on adsorbents increases with lipophilicity.(4-5) Additionally, the 
effects of moisture competition and high temperature desorption, which reduce the VOC adsorption 
capacities of adsorbents, have been extensively investigated.(6-12)  
Generally, various solvents (such as ketones and alcohols) are gathered together in an internal 
circulation cabinet. This investigation evaluated the competitive adsorption of mixed gaseous methyl ethyl 
ketone (MEK), acetone and isopropanol (IPA) by a hydrophobic molecular sieve. The experimental data 
for MEK adsorption capacity (Q, g MEK/g MS), which is altered by mixed acetone and IPA, have been 
provided to local manufacturers to improve the application of adsorbent materials used in an internal 
circulation cabinet.

A gastight glass tube (part 11 of Fig. 2) was filled with around 10 g of hydrophobic molecular sieve 
(HiSiv 1000, UOP LLC Company, Des Plains, IL, USA). The space velocity (vS) of VOC-rich air stream 
through the adsorbent zone was approximately 1.3 1/s. The adsorbent tube was placed in an oven (part 13 
of Fig. 2) at a constant temperature of 27oC. The VOC adsorption periods ranged from 60 to 720 min. The 
RH value of the VOC-carrying stream was measured using a humidity analyzer (testo 400, TESTO, 
Germany, part 12 of Fig. 2). The RH of the gas streams was maintained at 72 3% in all test runs. 
Operation of the system at a constant RH and temperature prevented moisture and heat from affecting the 
VOC adsorption capacity.  
Calculating VOC Adsorption Capacity   
When the adsorption test was completed, the glass tube and molecular sieve were placed in a 
high-temperature oven to desorb VOCs in a dry stream of 0.5 L/min at 250oC. The desorbed VOC-rich gas 
was collected in 10 L Teflon gas sampling bags (SKC, USA). The desorption period was around 2.5 hr, in 
which the adsorbed VOCs were removed from the molecular sieve. All desorbed gases were sampled 
using a gastight syringe (Hamiltom, USA) and then analyzed using a GC-FID (6890N, Agilent, USA). The 
internal volume of the Teflon bags was determined by the method of buoyancy using draining water. 
Multiplying the analyzed concentration by the volume of the bag yielded the mass of VOC adsorbed by 
the molecular sieve. Summing all of the VOC masses in a desorption run and then dividing that sum by 
the mass of molecular sieve in grams yielded Q. The calibration curves for VOC analysis by GC-FID were 
interiorly replicated examination using samples of known concentrations once per week.  
Experimental materials  
The tested hydrophobic molecular sieve (HiSiv 1000) was produced by UOP LLC. HiSiv adsorbents 
are synthetically produced silicon-aluminum oxides that have an Si/Al ratio of from 10 to 1000. HiSiv

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
Variations of Adsorption Capacity With VOC Concentrations   
MEK adsorption tests were performed using the molecular sieve at an inlet concentration ranging 
from 113 to 4564 ppm, over periods of 60 600 min at 27oC. Figure 4 shows the variations of MEK 
adsorption capacity (Q) with concentration (C) at various adsorption times, and Table II presents formulae 
(Eqs. (7) (11)) in Fig. 3. Table II shows a proportional relationship between the natural logarithm of the 
adsorption time and adsorption capacity. In fact, the values of Q at C = 2815 ppm and 4564 ppm are close 
to each other, and the inlet concentration of MEK should be under 2815 ppm for an effective adsorption 
operation.  
Determining the VOC Equilibrium Isotherms of Adsorption  
The VOC adsorption curves (Fig. 3) have not yet reached at equilibrium for the adsorption period of 
600 min. Equations (7) (11) were adopted with various mean values of inlet concentration (113, 416, 759, 
1429 and 2815 ppm) using extended adsorption period of 3200 min to determine the equilibrium 
adsorption capacity Qe (Table III). The equilibrium adsorption times drop from 3200 min at C = 113 ppm 
to 2000 min for C = 2815 ppm.  
Figure 4 presents the simulated equilibrium adsorption isotherms obtained using Langmuir formulae 
with the data of Qe and C in Table III. Notably, the reciprocal values of Qe and C, 1/Qe and 1/C in Fig. 4, 
must be adopted to find constants a and b in Eq. (3).(18) The R2 value (0.970), associated with Eq. (12), 
indicates that the Langmuir formula, Qe = [0.000117C/(1+0.00216C)], properly specifies the equilibrium 
adsorption isotherm of MEK by HiSiv 1000.

ratio approached 0.80 ( 796.0
842
670 ), competitive adsorption of mixed IPA occurs at an actual adsorption 
capacity of as low as 79.4% of estimated value. However, the strong adsorption competition between 
mixed adsorbates does not dominate in a mixture of acetone and MEK, even when the concentrations of 
MEK and acetone were close to each other (730 ppm vs. 795 ppm).  
Besides the electrostatic force between the adsorbent and adsorptive sites of molecular sieves, which 
is primarily due to the cations within the crystal lattice structure of molecular sieves, the affinity between 
adsorbates and adsorbent for mixed VOCs is essential. The n-octanol-water partitioning constant (Kow) is a 
universal parameter used in determining the affinity of organic compounds to the lipophilic/hydrophilic 
surface. A VOC with a higher Kow is more easily adsorbed by the hydrophobic adsorbents on their 
adsorption sites. Angioi et al.(4) and Polati et al.(5) proposed the lipophilicity/hydrophobicity theory, based 
on the examination of the adsorption capacities of chloroanillins on montmorillonite and kaolinite sieves. 
According to the Kow values in SRC PhysProp s data base, Kow of MEK, acetone and IPA are 1.95, 0.575 
and 1.12, respectively.(22) Among target VOCs, MEK is the most hydrophobic, and has the strongest 
affinity for hydrophobic HiSiv 1000. Table IV reveals that when the acetone/MEK and IPA/MEK 
concentration ratios are under 0.17, both acetone and IPA result in limited competitive adsorption of MEK; 
however, as the acetone/MEK and IPA/MEK concentration ratios increase, IPA reduces the adsorption 
capacity of MEK more than does acetone. Given this concentration competition, hydrophobicity or Kow 
values of hydrocarbons should be further considered if VOCs of different Kow are present in a sealed 
cabinet with hydrophobic molecular sieve adsorbents.  
Working Parameters for the Internal Circulation Cabinet  
To prevent the over-adsorption of VOC by HiSiv 1000, the operation parameters are recommended as 
follows. The accumulated emission concentration was approximately 100 ppm, based on the actual

CONCLUSIONS  
A series of adsorption tests (adsorption temperature = 27oC, RH = 72 3%) were performed on the 
hydrophobic molecular sieve, which was used as the adsorbent in an internal circulation cabinet for storing 
organic solvents. Experimental results show that the MEK adsorption capacity, Q (g MEK/g MS), can be 
simulated as the natural logarithm of adsorption time for MEK concentrations from 113 to 2815 ppm (Eqs. 
(7)-(11)). This work also established the Langmuir model, which yields the MEK adsorption isotherm 
between the equilibrium adsorption capacity, Qe, and the VOC concentration, C (ppm), at Qe = 
[0.000117C/(1+0.00216C)].  
A low concentration ratio (< 0.17) of mixed acetone and IPA with MEK rarely affects the MEK 
adsorption of hydrophobic HiSiv 1000. However, competitive adsorption, which reduces the adsorption 
capacity of MEK, results from the high concentration ratio (> 0.80) of IPA to MEK. However, the high 
concentration ratio of acetone to MEK does not cause dominant competitive adsorption. The 
hydrophobicity of hydrocarbons, specified by kow, should be further considered when varoius 
hydrophilic/hydrophobic VOCs are gathered in an internal circulating adsorption system cabinet with 
molecular sieve adsorbents. If the kow values of VOCs approach those of the other components, then 
competitive adsorption is occurring for the mixed adsorbates in the cabinet. It is recommended that 
specific internal circulating cabinet should be used for the hydrocarbon solvent of a single group to 
prevent the competitive adsorption.
