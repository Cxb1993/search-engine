一般邊坡穩定的問題大都將土體視為完全乾燥或完全飽和來研究。事實上，
邊坡的崩塌及其穩定性與土壤中水分的流動有關係密切，但現有的邊坡穩定分析
方法大多不考慮滲流對土體抗剪強度和邊坡穩定性的影響，不能完全符合實際的
情況，本研究建造一組多功能水文環境試驗砂箱並以邊坡模型試驗來探討降雨及
地下水入滲對於未飽和邊坡之穩定性的影響。 
 
二、研究方法 
1.水文環境試驗箱設計、建造與測試 
本研究團隊根據前人之研究經驗與未來相關模型試驗研究需求，於計畫執
行第一年(NSC98-2218-E-390-002)自主研發一可控制地下水位及降雨強度之水
文環境試驗箱，該試驗箱之設計及建造經過SAP2000軟體進行應力及變形分析，
並滿足在 200G 離心機重力場的環境下之變形限制、強度需求與邊界效應等因素。
第一年以該試驗箱於 1G 環境下進行地下水及降雨誘發邊坡崩塌之模型實驗，該
試驗箱及降雨系統如圖 1所示。其降雨系統採高壓驅動之微霧噴頭搭配外置式加
壓系統以控制流量，微霧粒徑可低於 50μm，避免試體沖蝕現象發生。此試驗箱
之功能完善，地下水的入滲可從土體後方滲入，以模擬側向滲流力所造成之崩塌
現象。同時另可藉由連通管之設計從土體下方入滲模擬地下水自底盤湧升激發邊
坡失穩之效應。此外，該試驗箱之製作前經過 SAP2000 軟體進行應力及變形分
析，並考量將來在 200G 離心機重力場的環境下之變形限制、強度需求與邊界效
應等因素。試驗箱分為九部分：試驗箱主體 U 型槽、背板、前方透明壓克力面
板、前方視窗護板、左側地下水位控制槽，側向入流槽與出流槽、底板向上滲流
槽、上方降雨系統與底部出流水儲水槽，而前方透明壓克力面板用以觀察及監控
實驗過程中土體模型之變化，並可架設高畫素攝影機，側錄實驗過程。為減輕離
心機承載之重量，試驗箱所有金屬均採用高強度鋁合金材構材，並完成陽極硬化
處理。 
計畫執行第二年(99-2221-E-390-022)初期，因中央大學土木系地工離心機
進行振動台之安裝與測試，因而改變原先規劃，將試驗箱送往美國紐約哥倫比亞
大學離心機實驗室進行測試，並透過高雄大學土木與環境工程學系與哥倫比亞大
學土木工程與工程力學系之雙邊合作關係，以研究交流模式進行試驗箱之 200G
重力場測試，測試結果證明該水文環境試驗箱及附屬設備可於離心機中正常使用，
無安全之虞。然驅動降雨系統所需之高壓則改以離心機飛行時所提供之重力場供
應。

中降雨於邊坡土體內入滲行為會造成邊坡之瞬間崩塌，此現象與1G情況下情況相
近。另外，崩塌時坡址位置裝設之孔隙水壓計讀值亦有瞬間增高之情形。且崩塌

三、結果與討論 
1. 地下水位變化導致邊坡崩塌之定性與定量分析 
由地下水滲流模型試驗結果發現，邊坡崩塌發生時坡趾位置均有湧水及孔隙
水壓突然增高之情形，邊坡破壞時因坡趾流失造成上方土體失去支撐而下滑，此
狀況與 1G 試驗時之多階段崩塌有明顯差異。滑坡時坡頂未發現張力裂縫，崩塌
時水位深度隨土體細粒料(fines content)比例增加而增高(圖 7)。由邊坡崩塌
面比較可得知(圖 8)，崩塌深度隨土體細粒料(fines content)比例增加而加深。 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. 降雨強度變化導致邊坡崩塌之定性與定量分析 
在降雨模型試驗結果發現，隨著降雨強度提高，邊坡破壞所需之降雨延時縮
短(圖 9)。此外崩塌所需降雨延時亦隨細粒料(fines content)比例增加而縮短。邊
坡崩塌發生時坡趾位置有浸潤及孔隙水壓增高之情形，坡頂前緣則因坡面土體浸
潤，土體自重增加，會隨坡趾失穩而下滑。坡頂接近滑動面前緣偶有張力裂縫發

四、結論 
本研究藉由邊坡模型試驗結果以非飽和土壤強度理論及非飽和地下水傳輸
理論為基礎，以研究水文因子對邊坡穩定性影響，並針對邊坡崩塌規模(崩塌深
度及崩塌量)及崩塌成因探討如下: 
(1). 由地下水滲流試驗中得知，邊坡崩塌所需之地下水位與相應之水力梯度隨土
體組成顆粒大小有關，顆粒組成越小孔隙越小，其臨界深度與水力梯度越
高。 
(2). 由降雨入滲試驗結果得知，降雨強度提高可縮短邊坡破壞所需之延時。且崩
塌之臨界降雨延時隨土體組成粒徑減小而縮短。崩塌之深度亦受土體組成顆
粒之影響，然卻與降雨強度無明顯關聯。 
(3). 所有邊坡崩塌發生時坡趾位置均有浸潤湧水及孔隙水壓增高之情形，推斷崩
塌之原因乃源自於坡趾失穩而造成上方土體下滑。 
(4). 影像分析(DIC)技術在本研究中成功運用，解決過去倚賴接觸式儀器量測對
模型造成擾動之困擾，顯著提昇物理模型試驗技術。 
(5). 水文模型試驗箱與離心機之結合使用，經由數值分析結果比較，確立其結果
可靠度。

Abstract 
 
The influencing factors of the landslides were evaluated by comparing the 
occurrence of landslides in Lawnon River basin prior to and after the rainfall and 
earthquake events in recent 5 years (2005 ~ 2009). The landslide ratio in the study 
area was low (less than 4%) before 2007 and it significantly increased in the event of 
typhoon Morakot in 2009. The enormous accumulative rainfall is the major 
triggering factor. In addition, a major seismic activity in March 4 2008 is also vital 
to landslide occurrence. No evidential coseismic landslides were found in March 4 
earthquake, 2008, however, the influence on slope stability has been observed from 
the apparent growth of landslide ratio in the four rainfall events followed by the 
quake. In addition, the existed landslide areas are more sensitive to landslide 
enlargement/development. The failure ratios of enlarged landslides is larger than 
those of new landslides, which indicates as a landslide occurs, it will be more easily 
to initiate subsequent failure nearby.

1  Introduction 
 
Taiwan is an island with abundant rainfall. The torrential rainfall accompanied with 
typhoons frequently causes slope failures such as landslides and debris flows. 
Moreover, as located in the Circum-Pacific Seismic Belt, an active mountain-
building region, there are frequent earthquakes on the island. The dynamic effects 
caused by earthquakes also degrade the slope stability. Therefore, slopeland 
disasters are major natural hazards and threat to both human lives and environmental 
ecology in Taiwan. The Lawnon River basin in southern Taiwan, which is one of the

3.1.2  Satellite images 
 
In this study, 16 images from FORMOSAT-II satellite, listed in Table 2, were 
selected based on the point in time before and after the 10 significant typhoon and 
storm events from 2005 to 2009. FORMOSAT-II satellite is a sun-synchronous 
satellite with the orbit height of 891 km. It has high-resolution and daily revisit 
imagery and four bands with 8-m resolution color mode and 2-m resolution 
panchromatic mode. Colorful image includes blue, green, red and near infrared 
bands corresponding to the wavelength of 0.45～0.52m, 0.52～0.60m, 0.63～0.69m 
and 0.76 ～ 0.90m, respectively. Since the images were used to recognize the 
landslide areas in our study domain, the selected images were required to be cloud-
free. Following the selection of satellite images, the preprocessing tasks including 
geometric correction and radiometric correction were carried out before the analysis 
of the images. 
 
3.1.3 Earthquakes 
 
The records of seismic activities from 2005 to 2009 were collected from Jiasian 
seismic station (maintained by CWB), which is the closest seismic monitoring 
station to the study area. There were 10 events with detected seismic intensity larger 
than 2 (larger than 8 gals) selected. The magnitudes and induced peak ground 
accelerations at the study area were analyzed. 
 
3.1.4  Geological and Topographical data 
 
Geological and Topographical data were collected from 1:25,000 paper maps 
published by the Central Geological Survey (CGS) in Taiwan. The data were stored 
in vector format within the Arc/info GIS software through manual digitization. A 
digital elevation model (DEM) of 40×40 m was constructed from the topographical 
dataset, and maps of slope inclination angle and aspect distribution were then 
derived from the DEM. River networks, roads, and other basic geographical data 
were also digitized from the basic topographic maps. 
 
3.2 Data digitization and mapping  
 
The accumulative rainfall of each rain observation station was calculated through 
summing up the hourly records within the whole storm event. The accumulative 
rainfall data of 12 observation stations distributed within the study area was 
processed to create the isohyets for 10 typhoon and storm events. The spatial analyst 
function of the GIS was adopted to conduct this work. 
The landslides were recognized from the satellite images and the sliding areas 
were manually digitized with the Arc/info GIS software. The territory of digitization 
is the study area in this research, which is 130.4 km2 around the Bao-Lai area. 
Reconnaissance works and in-situ observations have been executed in the domain to 
understand the geological and topographical conditions which could not be shown in 
9 
3.4 Attribute assignment and combined database of landslides 
 
Assignment of the various kinds of attributes to individual digitized landslides is 
critical to a quantitative analysis of the relationship between landslides and their 
causative factors. It is known that gathering and handling of the various attributes of 
landslides is an effort-consuming task, and abundance of field reconnaissance work 
is usually required. The use of GIS makes the management of digital databases more 
and more quickly and accurately to users. Connecting the landslide database with 
other internal/external databases is an efficient way of assigning causative factor 
values to individual landslides. 
 
3.5 Spatial relationship of landslides and their triggering & 
causative factors 
 
In this study, to understand the relationship between landslides and triggering factors 
(rainfall and earthquake) and causative factors (lithology, geological structure, 
topography and hot spring sites), the spatial overlay function of the GIS was adopted 
to carry out the task. For example, overlaying lithology coverage with landslide 
coverage through the Union operator in Arc/Info will tag each landslide with a 
lithology index. The combined database includes not only the basic items stored in 
the landslide coverage, but also the new items such as lithology type from the 
lithology coverage. It provided a substantial basis for further analysis of the 
relationship between landslides and their causative factors. 
 
 
4  Analysis results 
 
4.1 Influence of rainfall on landslides 
 
Rainfall, especially in the form of rainstorm, is the dominant factor that induces 
landslides. In this study, the accumulative rainfall of each event analyzed calculated 
from the hourly gauge data of 12 gauge stations were used. With the combination of 
accumulative rainfall data and landslide area of each storm event in Fig. 5, it is 
observed that landslide regions of the study area are growing in recent 5 years, even 
though some small recovery appeared between two consecutive events. The 
occurrence of landslides has close relation to rainfall amounts. As seen in Fig. 5, 
before 2008, the variation of rainfall within the study area was not obvious, so that 
the variation of landslide areas was not significant. The extreme rainfall brought by 
Typhoon Morakot in 2009 remarkably increased the scale of landslides. It is evident 
that rainfall dominates the scale of landslides. In comparison of rainfall data among 
the events, typhoon Morakot has the highest accumulative precipitation (2502 mm in 
average), followed by typhoon Haitang (1882 mm in average). However, the 
average landslide area induced by typhoon Haitang was only 2.1 km2, much less 
than those induced by typhoon Jangmi and Kalmaegi in 2008, which is worth further 
exploring.

Figure 6  Variation of landslide ratios with respect to different geological 
formations. 
 
Figure 7 shows the variations of failure ratios for three terms of landslides 
(existed, enlarged, and new landslides) with respect to different geological 
formations. It shows that the landslide ratio is positively correlated to accumulative 
rainfall. It is also found that as accumulative rainfall increases, the ratio of enlarged 
landslides is higher than that of new slides. The landslides induced by extreme 
rainfall mostly belong to enlarged slides.

rainfall is one of the primary triggering factors to cause the slides. However, in 
comparison of rainfall data among the events except typhoon Morakot, typhoon 
Haitang in 2005 had higher accumulative rainfall (1882 mm in average) than the 
other storm events, but its landslide area is smaller than those of most storm 
events. The patterns of landslide scale variation and rainfall record seem to be 
identical after 2008, which implies the existence of other factor(s) to trigger the 
transition of landslide sensitivity.  
2.  Earthquake is another primary triggering mechanism to induce landslides. 
Different from the landslide behavior observed in central Taiwan during 1999 
Chi-Chi earthquake (ML=7.3), co-seismic landslides are not frequently found in 
Lawnon River basin during the quakes from 2005 to 2009, which is possibly due 
to the limited seismic intensities. Nevertheless, it is well accepted that after an 
earthquake, the stability of slopes would be influenced for a long time [16-19]. 
In this study, March 4 earthquake in 2008 with PGA close to 140 gals is inferred 
to disturb the slope stability so as to result in the apparent increment of landslide 
ratios in the 4 rainfall events since July, 2008. Note that the critical seismic 
intensity leading to the transition of slope stability is not determined in this 
study.  
3.  The lithological effect on landslide sensitivity is unobvious before the March 4 
earthquake in 2008. After the quake, the sedimentary formations (Cc and Tn) is 
more prone to the increment of landslide ratios compared to metamorphic rock 
areas (Co and Ep).  
4.  It is observed that the existed landslide areas are more sensitive to landslide 
enlargement/development. The failure ratios of enlarged landslides is larger than 
those of new landslides, which indicates as a landslide occurs, it will be more 
easily to initiate subsequent failure nearby. As a result, the soil and water 
conservation works should be taken up soon to prevent further development of 
failure slopes.
