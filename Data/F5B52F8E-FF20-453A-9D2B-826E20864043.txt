for natural singing voice synthesis. One commonly used technique for synthesis of the 
speech waveform in text-to-speech synthesis is concatenation of short speech units 
taken from a prerecorded inventory. After concatenation, these units are modified in 
duration and melody to smoothly join each other and achieve the prosody of a natural 
utterance. In order to perform these modifications without introducing 
unnatural-sounding artifacts, signal modeling techniques must be employed  [2] -  [7]. 
When singing a song, one tries to express lyrics by changing notes according to 
a melody. Singing is most often an interpretation of a predefined musical score. 
However, a score only defines the notes to be sung, the natural prosody which 
exhibits the characteristics of human’s singing still need to be precisely calculated. 
Especially important is that the naturalness of voices depends on the F0 contour 
greatly. For example, the F0 contours of singing voices correspond to the melody of a 
song, and these contours include several types of fluctuation  [8]. Vibrato is the 
quasi-periodic frequency modulation (5 – 8 Hz). Moreover, there are fine fluctuations 
that affect the naturalness of singing-voices in F0 contours.  
1.4 研究方法 
1.4.1. Corpus 
Recording 
Two corpora are built for observation of the characteristics of singing. The first one is 
the Mandarin art songs collection. One female and one male recorded the corpus. The 
female is a music teacher and a drama soprano. She sang 20 songs. And the male is a 
student of a music department and a lyric tenor. He sang 20 different songs. They are 
recorded at 44.1 kHz sampling rate and 24-bit. 
The other is the Taiwanese children’s songs collection. Though it is recorded in 
Taiwanese, we can still use it to observe the variation of F0. Because it is children’s 
song, its F0 will be expected not as complicated as art songs and presented a more 
simple F0 pattern. A part of the collections was recorded by three female students of 
an elementary school. They recorded totally 18 songs under a music teacher’s 
supervision. The other part was recorded by four adults, two males and two females. 
Each of them was asked to sing the same 33 songs. They are all recorded at 96 kHz 
sampling rate and 24-bit. Table 1 shows the information of the children’s songs 
database.

F0 Extraction of MIDI 
In order to extract the MIDI F0, a Matlab Midi Toolbox created by Petri 
Toiviainen and Tuomas Eerola is used. The information of notes can be read from 
MIDI files. The matrix of notes information is shown in Fig. 2. The rows stand for the 
individual note events. The columns refer to the types of information - ONSET 
(BEATS), DURATION (BEATS), MIDI channel, MIDI PITCH, VELOCITY, ONSET 
(SECONDS), DURATION (SECONDS).

F0 Extraction of the Recorded Singing Voices 
We adopted STRAIGHT to extract the F0 contours of the recorded singing voices. 
STRAIGHT is a versatile speech manipulation tool invented by Hideki Kawahara. 
The STRAIGHT interface is as shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 5 shows its analysis window and 
Fig. 6 is an F0 contour example of a singing voice. The green line is the original 
recorded singing-voice F0 contour and the blue line is the F0 contour of score notes.

1.4.2 F0 Modeling 
The prosody includes the duration, energy, pause and the pitch-accent control. Singing 
is most often an interpretation of a predefined musical score. Prosodic patterns are 
automatically assigned to each character by the information given from the score. 
However, a score only defines the notes to be sung. If the prosody modification step 
transforms the pitch of every frame to match its predefined target, the result is a signal 
that does not exhibit the natural pitch fluctuations of the human voice. 
In this subsection, we will make an analysis of F0 fluctuations first, followed 
with three kinds of F0 modeling methods. The first is a very simple method using 
orthogonal transformation smoothing method, the second is a similar method, second 
order damping model, with  [8], and the last on is a more flexible fitting method. 
Analysis of F0 Fluctuations 
According to  [8], there are four kinds of fluctuations observed in the singing F0 
contour. They are: 
(1) Overshoot: deflection exceeding the target note after note changes. 
(2) Vibrato: quasi-periodic frequency modulation (5–8 Hz). 
(3) Fine fluctuation: irregular fine fluctuations regarding the modulation frequency 
and modulation amplitude. The modulation frequency is higher than about 10 Hz, 
 12
Trained vocalists produce a 5-8 Hz near-sinusoidal vibrato. Vocalists usually are 
not able to vary the rate of vibrato, but rather modify the modulation depth to create 
expressive changes in the voice. A sine wave is used to represent the vibrato. Besides, 
our system uses a parameter to control vibrato depth over the course of the musical 
phrase, thus providing a mechanism for adding expressiveness to the vocal passage. 
In addition, fine fluctuations are considered. A simple equation for 
“quasirandom” pitch fluctuations in speech  [9] is used as

πππ ++=Δ 0F                          (1) 
The addition of this fluctuation to the desired pitch contour gives the voice a more 
“human” feel. 
Abrupt transitions of one note to another at a different pitch are either not a 
natural phenomena. Rather, singers tend to transit somewhat gradually from one note 
to another. We implemented it by applying an orthogonal transformation at 
note-to-note transition to accomplish the smoothing.  
Second Order Damping Model 
This model is a second order damping model. Since the vibrato is not that apparent in 
children’s songs, only the other three kinds of fluctuations are considered. Overshoot 
and Preparation are modeled as a second order damping model and the fine 
fluctuations are modeled as irregular rapid oscillation. 
The transfer function ( )sG  of the second-order system is represented as

, where s  is the Laplace operator, nω  is a natural frequency, ζ  is a damping 
coefficient. The two poles of the second-order system are 21 1n np jζω ω ζ= − + −  
and 22 1n np jζω ω ζ= − − − . 
The two poles will have different property when the damping coefficients 
change. In the following, four conditions of the damping coefficients will be 
discussed.

It is hard to get an analytical solution. Fortunately, we are interested in a 
reasonable solution instead of an exact solution. So the solution space can be confined 
to a finite dimensional space and approximate a complex function by a combination 
of other simple functions. Based on Rayleigh-Ritz method, a function can be 
represented as a linear combination of a set of basis functions. Suppose we have N 
nodes, and ( )i sφ  are the basis functions. From Rayleigh-Ritz method, we have

 an interpolation curve. The goal now is to find the iv  and iu  
which minimize P. The cubic splines can be chosen as the basis functions 
The shape of the curve can be changed or effects can be added on curve by 
simply moving the guiding points, and fitting it again. For example, fit a curve that 
passes through a set of fluctuated points to simulate the pitch fluctuations. It’s also 
easy to add any function, like vibrato, to the resultant curve to modify the curve.   
1.4.3 Singing Synthesis System 
The system architecture of our singing synthesis system is shown in Figure 12. The 
score-to-singing system is composed of three main parts, namely, linguistic 
processing module, prosodic processing module, and pitch synchronous overlap and 
add (PSOLA) synthesizer. The input lyrics will be sent to the linguistic processing 
module, which identifies words and looks up dictionary to find out the correct 
pronunciations. Synthesis units are then selected from the unit inventory according to 
the pronunciations. Using the information from the predefined musical score and the 
F0 control model that generates natural F0 contours, prosodic processing module 
decides the prosody, such as duration, pause, energy, and pitch contour. A synthesizer 
is to synthesize and adjust the synthesis units to the desired output voice. The more 
detailed description of these three modules will be shown in the following.

units with semantic independence and integrity. In addition, local groupings of 
characters into words are crucial for correctly assigning pronunciation to each 
character. Thus, in order to analyze the input text, it is necessary to identify words 
from the sequence of character string. 
The input Chinese characters will be separated into word groups by looking up 
the dictionary. By applying the direct dictionary look-up, all the possible 
combinations of words are determined. The maximum matching algorithm is used. 
The combination that can create more long words and less number of words has the 
priority.  
It is impossible to collect all of the possible words in lexicon by the reason of the 
specific characteristics of Chinese of creating new words very easily. So, for 
shortening the time of looking up and reducing the space a dictionary occupied, only 
the irregular words and words with high frequent occurrence need to be gathered, the 
other ones with regular rules will be handled in morphological processing. The main 
three word-formation considered are affixation, reduplication and compound. 
In the end, the appropriate pronunciations are assigned according to the lexicon. 
For flexibility, lexicons for specific purposes or user definition could be added by a 
dictionary extension function. 
Prosodic Processing 
The prosody includes the duration, energy, pause and the pitch-accent control. Singing 
is most often an interpretation of a predefined musical score. Prosodic patterns are 
automatically assigned to each character by the information given from the score. 
However, the F0 models described in F0 modeling subsection are used to generate a 
more natural F0 contour. 
In addition, in speech perception literature, the notion of a syllabic “perceptual 
center” (PC) has been introduced. In perceptual experiments, it was found that 
listeners reliably placed the PC at the vocalic onset of the syllable  [10] [11]. This 
effect has been noted in the study of rhythmic characteristics of singing as well. 
Therefore, our system aligns the beginning of the first note in a syllable with the onset 
of the vowel in that syllable. 
Parameters for changing global tempo, volume and pitch are also provided in the 
system.

1.5.2. Conclusions and Future Works 
A Mandarin singing synthesis system is proposed. The system employs a 
concatenation-based text-to-speech method to synthesize arbitrary lyrics in Mandarin. 
Using information contained in a score file, the system concatenates and modifies 
units from an inventory of 414 syllables, originally recorded in reading style, to form 
arbitrary lyrical singing voice. Three kinds of F0 control model that can control F0 
fluctuations and generate natural F0 contours of singing-voices are shown. The 
achievements can be applied to various entertainment and musical production field. 
Our future works will be to improve the singing voice quality. As for speech 
synthesis, large improvements have been obtained by the technique of unit selection 
 [12]. If the database of recordings is large enough, a great number of sound events in 
many different contexts are available, then there is rarely the need to apply 
transformations, which always degrade quality of the sound. One of the most difficult 
problems associated with selection synthesis, which will be thoroughly explored, is 
determining the strategy for unit selection, and tuning the parameters of this strategy.
