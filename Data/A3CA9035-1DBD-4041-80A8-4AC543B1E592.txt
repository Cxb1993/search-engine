ABSTRACT 
   A novel chiral monomer end capped with a cholesteryl group and threaded 
with β-cyclodextrin was synthesized in order to induce the formation of a helical 
polymer. 1H-NMR studies revealed that one or two cyclodextrin molecules were 
threaded onto the synthesized chiral monomer, leading to the formation of a 
helical construction of self-assembled inclusion complexes. The formation of a

including pharmaceutical applications for drug release,13-15 fluorescence 
enhancement,16-18 and solubility enhancement19 by inclusion complex formation.  
The low solubility of β-cyclodextrin, as compared to α- and γ-cyclodextrins, 
is somewhat surprising. This seems to be related to the stronger crystal lattice 
energy (as with cellulose) resulting from more organized intramolecular hydrogen 
bonds, as well as the similarity to the structure of water resulting in a low entropy 
of hydration.20  
   Supramolecular chirality has received much interest in recent years.21-25 In 
contrast to molecular chirality, in which the atoms of a molecule are arranged in 
an asymmetric manner in space, supramolecular chirality involves the asymmetric 
arrangement of molecules by secondary forces.26-29 We have previously reported 
the chemistry of a fibrous construction resulting from the self-assembly of 
inclusion complexes obtained from chiral monomers threaded with 
β-cyclodextrin.30 It is known that cholesterol can be used to derive cholesteric 
liquid crystals with a helical molecule alignment.31-34 In this paper, in order to 
emphasize the effect of chirality on the molecular alignment, we report on the 
synthesis of a novel monomer with a shorter achiral segment and with a 
cholesteryl group at the terminal end of the monomer. The newly designed chiral 
monomer was threaded with β-cyclodextrin and formed inclusion complexes. A 
spring-like helical structure of the self-assembled inclusion complex cluster was 
confirmed using TEM and circular dichroism spectroscopy. We have also 
demonstrated a novel secondary assembly of a chiral inclusion complex by a 
chiral monomer threaded with β-cyclodextrin and end-capped with a cholesteryl 
group.

acidified with hydrogen chloride diluted with water until it was weakly acidic. 
The resulting precipitate was filtered and washed several times with water. The 
crude product was recrystallized from ethanol/water (4/1). Yield: 19.1 g (66.9 %), 
Tm= 139-140 oC.  
4-(6-Hydroxyhexyloxy)benzoic acid (32 mmol), N,N-dimethylaniline (33 
mmol), and a catalytic amount of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresol were dissolved in 
1,4-dioxane (50 mL). The solution was cooled in an ice/salt bath and a solution of 
acryloyl chloride (100 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (20 mL) was added dropwise with 
vigorous stirring. After 24 h at room temperature, the solution was poured into 
cold water and the precipitate was filtered. The crude product of 
4-(6-acryloyloxyhexyloxy)benzoic acid (AHBA) was washed several times with 
water and recrystallized twice from ethanol. Yield: 70%; phase transition 
temperature: Crystal 88.0 oC Nematic 92.0 oC Isotropic. The phase transition 
temperatures of the product were estimated by differential scanning calorimeter 
(DSC) and confirmed by polarizing optical microscope (POM).    
Cholesteryl-4-(6-acryloyloxyhexyloxy)benzoate (CAHB) was synthesized by 
reaction of 4-(6-acryloyloxyhexyloxy)benzoic acid (30 mmol) with cholesterol 
(30 mmol) in the presence of N,N’- dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC, 87 mmol) 
and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP, 3 mmol) using dichloromethane (150 mL) 
as solvent. The reaction mixture was stirred at 30 oC for 24 h. The resulting 
solution was filtered, washed with water, dried over magnesium sulfate and 
evaporated. The crude product was purified by liquid chromatography. Silica gel 
and ethyl acetate/hexane=1/8 were used as stationary phase and mobile phase, 
respectively. The obtained product was recrystallized twice from ethanol. Yield: 
56%; phase transition temperature: Crystal 101.2 oC Nematic 160 oC Isotropic; 
polymerization of the monomer occurred at 160 oC. Scheme 1 shows the synthetic

which disappeared after UV exposure due to polymerization. The polymerized 
self-assembled inclusion complex was analyzed using SEM, TEM and POM. The 
helical construction of polymerized inclusion complex was analyzed using a 
JASCO J-715 circular dichroism spectroscopy. For composite film, inclusion 
complex (30mmol), methyl mathacrylate (30mmol), trimethylolpropane 
triacrylate (10mmol), and benzoyl peroxide (5wt.%) were dissolved in methyl 
ethyl ketone. The sample mixture was dropped on a substrate. After drying, the 
mixture was cured under UV exposure.  
Results and Discussion 
   Synthesis of monomers threaded with β-cyclodextrin. The synthesis of the 
chiral monomer is shown in Scheme 1. The synthesized compounds were 
identified using FTIR and NMR. The inclusion complex of β-CD-CAHB was 
obtained as a white powder with a yield of approximately 80%. After thoroughly 
washing with pyridine and water, the powdered sample no longer contains free 
monomer or β-cyclodextrin. The purity of the β-CD-CAHB inclusion complexes 
were confirmed using DSC and FTIR. In the FTIR spectrum, the symmetric and 
asymmetric -O-H stretching mode of β-CD appeared at 3215-3385 cm-1, and the 
peaks in the 1700-1800 cm-1 region were assigned to the C=O stretching bands of 
CAHB. The specific rotation of monomer CAHB is -50.2o (CHCl3, 0.01g/ml). 
After treatment with β-cyclodextrin, however, the specific rotation of the 
inclusion complex is +8.08o (pyridine, 0.01g/ml). This result suggests that the 
threaded cyclodextrin affects the specific rotation of inclusion complex despite 
the fact that cyclodextrin is a symmetrical molecule.  
   The β-CD-CAHB inclusion complex is soluble in pyridine. Its 1H-NMR 
spectrum is shown in Figure 1. The peak area ratio of the characteristic protons of 
β-CD and CAHB was calculated and found to be 1.57. This result suggests that

Figure 2. Schematic representation of the cyclodextrin threaded inclusion 
complex. The calculated value of the CD/CPHB ratio is 1.57. This 
means that one or two CD molecules were threaded on each CAHB 
monomer.  
 
   Figure 3 shows the DSC curve of the synthesized β-CD-CAHB inclusion 
complex. In the first heating cycle, absorbed water evaporated around 100 oC35. 
The peak at 195 oC is assigned to the polymerization of the β-cyclodextrin 
threaded chiral monomers. In the cooling cycle and the second scanning of the 
sample, no significant peaks were observed. Monomer CAHB revealed liquid 
crystalline phases and unthreaded β-cyclodextrin revealed a melting point at 
about 305 oC. However, no significant peaks could be found at the temperatures 
of the phase transition points of the monomer by DSC scanning analyses. The 
results suggest that neither free monomers nor free β-cyclodextrin molecules were 
in the sample powder. It is noteworthy that the polymerization temperature of the 
pure monomer is around 160 oC. The polymerization temperature of the inclusion 
complex of β-cyclodextrin threaded monomer, however, was shifted to 195 oC, as 
shown in Figure 3. This result suggests an improvement in the thermal resistance 
of the β-cyclodextrin.

polymers via a self-assembly of β-cyclodextrin threaded chiral monomers. This 
molecular design enabled us to successfully synthesize a chiral inclusion complex 
and to induce the formation of a helical self-assembled inclusion complex and 
polymer. Theoretically, as Fiber Reinforced Plastics, the synthesized fibrous 
monomeric and polymeric self assembled inclusion complexes are expected to be 
used in Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) to strengthen the 
mechanical properties of the nano-films and the micro devices.

The helical structure of the monomeric and polymeric inclusion complexes was 
confirmed using TEM and circular dichroism microscopy. We have developed a 
novel method for the synthesis of helical polymers via self-assembly of chiral 
monomers threaded with β-cyclodextrin.

into cold water and the precipitate was filtered. The crude product
of 4-(6-acryloyloxyhexyloxy)benzoic acid (AHBA) was washed
several times with water and recrystallized twice from ethanol.
Yield: 70%; phase transition temperature: crystal 88.0 °C nematic
92.0 °C isotropic. The phase transition temperatures of the product
were estimated by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and
confirmed by polarizing optical microscope (POM).
Cholesteryl-4-(6-acryloyloxyhexyloxy)benzoate (CAHB) was
synthesized by reaction of 4-(6-acryloyloxyhexyloxy)benzoic acid
(30 mmol) with cholesterol (30 mmol) in the presence of N,N′-
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC, 87 mmol) and 4-(dimethylami-
no)pyridine (DMAP, 3 mmol) using dichloromethane (150 mL) as
solvent. The reaction mixture was stirred at 30 °C for 24 h. The
resulting solution was filtered, washed with water, dried over
magnesium sulfate, and evaporated. The crude product was purified
by liquid chromatography. Silica gel and ethyl acetate/hexane )
1/8 were used as stationary phase and mobile phase, respectively.
The obtained product was recrystallized twice from ethanol. Yield:
56%; phase transition temperature: crystal 101.2 °C nematic 160
°C isotropic; polymerization of the monomer occurred at 160 °C.
Scheme 1 shows the synthetic process of the reactions. The
synthesized products were identified using 1H NMR and FTIR.
Preparation of Chiral Monomer Threaded with -Cyclodex-
trin. To synthesize the inclusion complex, -cyclodextrin (-CD)
was dissolved in water at 60 °C. CAHB in tetrahydrofuran (THF)
was then added, and the resulting reaction mixture was stirred at
60 °C for 24 h. The turbid solution was ultrasonically agitated at
room temperature for 15 min, and the clear solution was allowed
to stand at room temperature for 2 days. The precipitate was
collected, washed thoroughly with THF and then with water to
remove the residual CAHB and -CD, and dried at 60 °C under
vacuum.
Polymerization of Self-assembled Monomers. The powdered
sample was set on a Petri dish, and benzoyl peroxide (BPO) was
used as a photoinitiator. BPO dissolved in methyl ethyl ketone (5
wt %) was dropped onto the powdered inclusion complex. After
drying at room temperature, the sample was exposed under UV
light for 5 min. The extent of polymerization was monitored using
FTIR by following the unsaturated double-bond absorption around
1640 cm-1, which disappeared after UV exposure due to polym-
erization. The polymerized self-assembled inclusion complex was
analyzed using SEM, TEM, and POM. The helical construction of
polymerized inclusion complex was analyzed using a JASCO J-715
circular dichroism spectroscopy. For composite film, inclusion
complex (30 mmol), methyl mathacrylate (30 mmol), trimethylol-
propane triacrylate (10 mmol), and benzoyl peroxide (5 wt %) were
dissolved in methyl ethyl ketone. The sample mixture was dropped
on a substrate. After drying, the mixture was cured under UV
exposure.
Results and Discussion
Synthesis of Monomers Threaded with -Cyclodextrin.
The synthesis of the chiral monomer is shown in Scheme 1.
The synthesized compounds were identified using FTIR and
NMR. The inclusion complex of -CD-CAHB was obtained
as a white powder with a yield of ∼80%. After thoroughly
washing with pyridine and water, the powdered sample no
longer contains free monomer or -cyclodextrin. The purity of
the -CD-CAHB inclusion complexes were confirmed using
DSC and FTIR. In the FTIR spectrum, the symmetric and
asymmetric -O-H stretching mode of -CD appeared at
3215-3385 cm-1, and the peaks in the 1700-1800 cm-1 region
were assigned to the CdO stretching bands of CAHB. The
specific rotation of monomer CAHB is -50.2° (CHCl3, 0.01
g/mL). After treatment with -cyclodextrin, however, the
specific rotation of the inclusion complex is +8.08° (pyridine,
0.01 g/mL). This result suggests that the threaded cyclodextrin
affects the specific rotation of inclusion complex despite the
fact that cyclodextrin is a symmetrical molecule.
The -CD-CAHB inclusion complex is soluble in pyridine.
Its 1H NMR spectrum is shown in Figure 1. The peak area ratio
of the characteristic protons of -CD and CAHB was calculated
and found to be 1.57. This result suggests that one or two -CD
molecules were threaded on each monomer. Figure 2 shows a
schematic representation of the -CD threaded CAHB monomer.
From the model, the threaded -CD is expected to improve the
molecular interaction between the inclusion complexes. Simi-
larly, the terminal cholesteryl group may offer a chiral effect
on the molecular alignment leading to the formation of a helical
construction. Theoretically, the chirality effect is quite similar
to the induction of a cholesteric phase from nematic liquid
crystals by addition of chiral dopants.
Figure 3 shows the DSC curve of the synthesized -CD-
CAHB inclusion complex. In the first heating cycle, absorbed
water evaporated around 100 °C.35 The peak at 195 °C is
assigned to the polymerization of the -cyclodextrin threaded
chiral monomers. In the cooling cycle and the second scanning
of the sample, no significant peaks were observed. Monomer

Report of the Attendance of SPIE International Conference  
Held at San Jose, USA  
(From 25 January to 28 January, 2009) 
 
摘要 
        美國光學學會 SPIE 於一月 25 日至 28 日於舊金山灣區 San 
Jose 舉行一年一度的學術、及技術研討會議。我於一月 24 日搭乘美
國聯合航空(United Airline)飛機由台北經由東京前往 San Jose參加該
大會。我應邀前往發表一篇邀請演講，以及一篇海報論文。此會議為
世界性之國際研討會，因此包含世界知名學者及光學相關業界均前往
參加。參加此會議不但在學術領域可獲得相當多的創意，在展示的光
學儀器、設備方面，也增加不少新知識及新見識。國科會所補助之旅
費與當地飯店住宿（一天 200 元）、及生活支出不成比例，而且註冊
費用亦相當貴（美金 700元），實難以應付實際支出。 
 
 
      I took an early HSR (high speed rail) from Tainan to Taoyuan on 
24 January 2009. I arrived at Taoyuan International Airport around 09:00. 
I took a flight of United Airline from Taipei to Tokyo. After 4 hours stay 
at Tokyo, we restarted our fly to San Francisco, USA. The arrival time at 
San Francisco was 15:00 on 24. I booked a shuttle bus from San 
Francisco Airport to San Jose. After a one-hour journey, I arrived at 
Fairmont Hotel at San Jose. Room rent of the Hotel is 200 US$ a night. It 
is too expensive for me although it is a special price via SPIE. San Jose is 
a small city for High Technology Factories. The city is quite closed. No 
travel bus, no sightseeing courses. San Jose is a good city for conferences 
but not for sightseeing.  
      SPIE is a great Optical Electronic Engineering Society. This 
4 
 
diffusers”, “Diffractive beam shaper with double side lenslet array for 
projector illumination”, and “Future prospects for high end laser 
projection”, respectively. Audiences raised many questions and discussed 
in detailed.  
      28 January was scheduled one full day poster display. From 10:00 
to 17:00, authors must set up their paper on the poster. Authors of poster 
should be present to answer questions concerning their poster papers from 
18:00 to 19:30. We also present one poster paper in this session. I went to 
the poster Hall around 11:00. As seen following, after setting up the 
poster paper, I took a picture in front of the poster. From 18:00, I went to 
the poster Hall and stay there to answer questions. Meanwhile, authority 
prepared some beer, wine, and snacks for the attendances. Many 
attendances came to the Hall. They talked, discussed, and cheat with each 
other. It is a good way to make friends and discuss to get some new idea.  
      On 29 January, a special event was scheduled from 7:30 to 9:00. A 
speial event about “Holography” was scheduled at Fairmonr Hotel. 
Atterton Room chaired by Hans I. Bjelkhagen from United Kindom. 
Furthermore, during the conference, there are some places exhibited some 
optical devices and materials every day.  
 
 
Conclusion 
      It was a tough journey from Taiwan to San Francisco and then San

A series of novel side chain liquid crystalline polyacrylates 
with pendent chiral groups was synthesized. Copolymerization 
of the monomers was carried out and the physical properties of 
the copolymers were investigated. Two miscible chiral 
compounds were also synthesized and used as chiral dopants to 
induce cholesteric liquid crystalline phases of polymers. The 
optical properties of the induced cholesteric liquid crystalline 
polymers were investigated by using UV-vis spectrometer. The 
appearance and the color variation of the polymer films before 
and after UV irradiation were also investigated.  
1. Introduction  
Due to the presence of the molecular chirality, the 
cholesterically ordered material has regions which each 
selectively reflect circularly polarized electromagnetic 
radiation of a band of wavelengths. The central wavelength (λ0) 
of the band of reflected wavelengths is determined by the pitch 
(p) of the molecular helix, according to n x pλ0 = , where n 
is the average refractive index of the cholesterically ordered 
material. The bandwidth △λ is given by △λ= p x △n, where 
△n is the birefringence of the uniaxially oriented phase 
corresponding to the cholesterically ordered phase. In the 
visible range, the regions selectively reflect circularly polarized 
 
 
applied to the polymer stabilized cholesteric texture (PSCT) 
cells, the director of the liquid crystals reoriented parallel to the 
direction of the applied field, and the PSCT cells became 
transparent.  
In principle, the specific rotation reveals the characteristics 
of net vector of the polarity of the chiral molecules on the 
planar polarized light. The “polar effect” should also work on 
host liquid crystal molecules. The results of both polar and 
steric interactions between chiral dopants and host liquid 
crystals are revealed as the helical twisting power (HTP). In 
this study, we synthesize and characterize a series of novel side 
chain liquid crystalline polyacrylates, incorporating liquid 
crystalline monomers with six or eleven methylene segments as 
spacers, and chiral monomers end capped with menthyl or 
cholesteryl groups. These syntheses were carried out in order to 
investigate the effect of methylene spacer length and linking 
group, between the rigid mesogenic core and terminal group, 
on the molecular interaction and physical properties of 
polymers. This allowed us to investigate the effect of linkages 
on the liquid crystalline properties of polymers. The liquid 
crystalline phases and thermal stability of chiral polymers were 
also examined.  
2. Experimental 
Synthesis of Monomers (Schemes 1 and 2) 
The chemical structures of chiral and liquid crystalline 
monomers used in this investigation are illustrated in Scheme 1. 
Scheme 2 shows the synthetic routes for the target chiral 
monomers M1-M3. 4-(6-Acryloyloxyhexyloxy) benzoic acid 
was synthesized in our laboratory according to the literature. 
Chiral monomers M4-M6 were synthesized following 
processes similar to those reported in our previous reports.16-20 
Liquid crystalline monomers M7 and M8 were synthesized 
according to the procedures described in the literature20 and our 
previous reports. The obtained products were purified and then 
identified using FTIR, 1H-NMR, and elemental analysis. 
 
 
A feed molar ratio of 83/17 of the comonomers was used to 
prepare binary copolymers. The typical synthetic procedures 
for the polymers are described as follows: To a solution of 
predetermined amount monomers in benzene was added with 3 
mol % of 2,2’-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN). These monomers 
were poured into a glass polymerization tube equipped with a 
sealing cap, which was degassed in a vacuum using a 
freeze-thaw technique and then sealed. After completion of 
polymerization, the polymers were precipitated in a large 
amount of methanol solution, and then the crude polymers 
were purified by dissolution in benzene and reprecipitation in 
methanol. Polymers were then dried in vacuum. 
Fabrication of Liquid Crystalline Polymer Films 
Glass plates were cleaned using a detergent solution and then 
were washed with water and acetone using ultrasonic 
equipment for 20 and 60 minutes, respectively. After 
completion of the cleaning process, the plates were dried in 
vacuum. The surface of the glass was coated with polyvinyl 
alcohol (Mw=20,000), dried, and then rubbed. A solution of 
polymer was made by dissolving roughly 0.2 g of the sample in 
2 ml of benzene. The solution was coated onto a glass substrate 
and further dried in a vacuum for 24 hours. The cholesteric 
polymer film was achieved by thermal annealing under the 
temperature of liquid crystal phase for 40-60 minutes. The 
obtained films were 80-100 μm in thickness and were 
examined for their optical properties. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Synthesis and Characterization 
In order to investigate the effect of spacer length and linking 
group between the rigid mesogenic core and terminal group on 
molecular interaction and physical properties of polymers, as 
shown in Scheme 1, a series of both chiral monomers end 
capped with various chiral segments and liquid crystalline 
monomers with six or eleven methylene segments were 
synthesized. Elemental analysis, FTIR, 1H, and 13C-NMR 
 
 
 
 
 
in 1H-NMR spectra disappeared completely. The peaks of the 
chemical shifts corresponding to the polymer were quite broad 
and consistent with the expected polymer structure. The final 
molar ratio composition of the copolymers, incorporating chiral 
and liquid crystalline monomers as co-monomers, was assessed 
through 1H-NMR spectrometry by comparing the integrated 
signals in the aliphatic regions (menthyl or cholesteryl moiety) 
of the chiral unit, located at 4.53-4.97 ppm, and in the aromatic 
regions of these two co-monomers.  
Scheme 2 shows the molecular structure of the polymers 
synthesized in this investigation. As seen in Table 1, chiral 
monomers end capped with a menthyl group revealed a higher 
specific rotation than those end capped with cholesteryl group. 
As seen in Table 1, the specific rotation of the copolymers was 
also estimated. Cleavage of the double bond and the binding of 
other monomers together did not seem to significantly affect 
the chirality of the compounds. The results also indicate that 
the specific rotation depends not only on the content of chiral 
units in polymers but also the coherence of polarity due to 
chemical bonding after polymerization.  
Liquid Crystalline Phases and Thermal Stabilities  
The thermal properties and the phases of the synthesized 
monomers are summarized in Tables 1. As shown in Table 1, 
the chiral monomers M1, M2, M4, and M5, which incorporate 
a terminal menthyl group, did not reveal any mesophase. In this 
case, the formation of mesophases may be limited by aspect 
ratio, steric, and polarity of the monomers. The results suggest 
that incoherence of monomers’ aspect ratio, steric, and polarity 
might influence the molecular interaction between monomers 
leading to the absence of mesophases. However, the 
introduction of cholesteryl groups in chiral monomers M3 and 
M6 resulted in the exhibition of mesomorphic phases. Both M3

using DSC and X-ray diffraction analyses and were compared 
with the polarized optical microscopic (POM) textures reported 
in the literature. Figure 1 shows DSC thermograms of 
monomer M3 at a heating rate of 10 Kmin-1. During the 
heating cycle of M3, a chiral nematic mesophase was observed 
between 110.3 and 204.9 oC before isotropization. During the 
cooling scan, an isotropic-to-chiral nematic phase transition at 
200.6 oC and crystallization at 76.6 oC were observed. As seen 
in Table 1, monomer M7, with an electron releasing –OC4H9 
segment as the terminal group, exhibited a monotropic 
mesophase and revealed a nematic phase (N; schlieren texture) 
at the temperature range of 57.1 to 33.3 oC during the cooling 
cycle. However, monomer M8 revealed a smectic phase (SA; 
fan-shape texture) during the heating cycle. This result suggests 
that the relatively longer methylene in M8 might increase the 
lateral molecular interaction. 
As shown in Scheme 2, a series of rod-like side chains with 
polar pendant group polymers were synthesized. From the 
results, all polymers were revealed to have a high interaction 
between side chain units leading to the generation of liquid 
crystalline phases. Homopolymers P1 and P2, containing 
terminal electron releasing butoxy (–OC4H9) groups, exhibited 
a smectic A phase (SA; fan-shaped texture). The additional 
ordering on polymerization caused mesophases to be more 
ordered than for the monomeric nanlogue and transition 
temperatures and clearing points were higher. This result also 
demonstrates that the introduction of a butoxy group at the 
terminal end of the monomers dramatically increases the 
molecular interaction and polymerization rate, and stabilizes 
the side chain segment orientation of the polymer, leading to 
the generation of high molecular weight and thermally stable 
polymers. In series A, chiral polymers CP1-CP6, comprising a 
pendant carbonate group as a linkage in the chiral monomer, 
exhibited chiral nematic mesophases (N*), with the exception 
of CP5. The introduction of a carbonate group as a linkage 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and the decrease of thermal resistance. Theoretically, the 
thermal resistance of polymers reveals polymer bond strength. 
However, the mesophase stability reveals the strength of 
intermolecular forces.  
X-ray Diffraction of Polymers 
X-ray diffraction measurements of the polymers were carried 
out to further elucidate the structures of the mesophases. 
Samples were heated to the temperature ranges of the 
mesophases and then quenched. Figures 3 (a) and (b) show the 
representative X-ray diffraction curves of CP5 and CP3/CP6, 
respectively. The X-ray pattern of CP5 showed the presence of 
a sharp and strong peak at a small angle region around 2θ = 
2.92o, corresponding to the layer d-spacing value of 30.2 Å at 
91.5 oC under cooling. Furthermore, a fan-shaped texture could 
be clearly observed by POM which is a characteristic texture of 
the smectic A phase. According to the molecular modeling 
calculation using CS Chem3DPro, employing MM2 energy 
parameters, the estimated all-trans molecular length l of the 
most extended conformation of chiral monomer M3 is around 
37.5 Å (the layer d-spacing value is ca. 30.2 Å by XRD 
patterns; l/d= 0.81). Therefore, a possible layer structure of 
CP5 is suggested to exhibit intercalated packing of the side 
chains. However, for the copolymers with nematic 
characteristics, no peak appeared in the small angle region, and 
the broad peak in the range of 2θ = 15-25o was examined, 
classically due to the average lateral distance between the 
neighboring chains with d-spacing of 3-5 Å at mesophases, as 
shown in Figures 3 (b).  
 
 
the reflection wavelength, is described by the helical twisting 
power (HTP) which is defined as the initial slope of the inverse 
helical pitch p-1 vs. the mole fraction x of the chiral dopant.  
Figure 4 shows the dependence of temperature on the reflective 
bands of the cholesteric liquid crystalline polymer CP3. Real 
color images of the  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cholesteric liquid crystalline polymer CP3 recorded at various 
temperatures were also given. Cholesteric liquid crystalline 
polymer CP3 showed a red iridescence in the range of 30-80 
oC, green at 100 oC, green-yellow at 120 oC, and blue at 130 oC. 
It was found that the whole visible range is accessible by 
varying the temperature. An increase in the film temperature 
induced blue shifts of the reflection bands, which were shifted 
from the infrared to a visible light region. Additionally, the 
bandwidth of the reflected light peak was narrow. The 
reflective wavelength and helical twisting power in CP3 and 
CP6 as a function of temperature are shown in Figure 5. The 
HTP value of CP3 at 30 oC is calculated as 7.81μm-1. An 
increase in temperature led to an increase in the HTP value of 
CP3, indicating that heat treatment might alter the polarity and
