摘要 
使用數值模擬及實驗方法進行分析，當液滴與物體表面間具有溫度梯度時，
氣體捲入液滴與物體表面之間，防止液滴與物體表面接觸，而造成液滴與接觸表
面間產生非潤濕效應。根據各種不同物理條件建立其理論模型，並利用數值方法
驗證熱毛細非潤濕的現象。並建立液滴流動行為之基本物理機制，利用數值方法
探討因熱毛細力驅動液滴表面所造成的捲氣效應。 
液珠周遭的空氣，因為受到移動平板的剪應力或是熱毛細對流的作用，而流
動到液珠與平板之間的間隙薄膜內，於是造成液珠與平板的沾濕抑制。等溫條件
下，雷諾數可對應於移動平板所造成的剪應力影響，韋伯數可代表不同流體的液
珠之變形程度。熱毛細條件下，馬洛哥尼數可對應於溫差所造成的熱毛細對流影
響，毛細數可代表不同流體的液珠之變形程度。對於相同的流體，較大的雷諾數
或是馬諾哥尼數，都可造成較大的沾濕抑制。在相同的移動平板速度下，具有較
大韋伯數的液珠；以及在相同溫差下，具有較大毛細數的液珠，其自由表面頂點
的內凹現象都會較明顯。在等溫以及熱毛細條件下，當兩板距離減少時，可以獲
得更明顯的非沾濕效應。 
分析並探討在大氣環境中，受到剪力作用的微米尺寸液滴所發生的抑制合併
與潤濕現象。驗證端牆速度(V)對端牆靠近液滴頂點距離(D)的影響，解釋了潤滑
薄膜的建立機制與防止液滴接觸移動端牆的行為。研究結果顯示，不論是矽油或
是水珠的自由表面的變形程度，都會隨著增加端牆速度和減少端牆靠近液滴頂點
距離，而更容易被觀察到，這是因為韋伯數增加所造成的現象。 
    由有限元素數值方法研究熱毛細對流所造成二矽油滴之非融合現象，使用
ALE和適應性等位函數法來追蹤液氣介面的移動和變形。非融合歸因於存在一個
自潤滑空氣薄膜的接觸將兩個液滴分開來，這是由熱毛細對流所產生。在本研究
中考慮在抑制融合下，溫差的影響、介於二液滴間的間隙薄膜厚度和矽油黏度對
熱毛細對流的能力。

Moreover, the air velocity swept by the motion of silicone-oil into the lubricating air 
film would be higher and hence, the coalescencing suppression was better.

一、前言 
液滴與液滴間的合併或抑制合併，或是液滴與固體間的潤濕或抑制潤濕，這
些現象在許多複雜的程序和系統，諸如燃燒、相分離(phase separation)、乳膠化
(emulsions)、雨滴形成等，都扮演著極為重要的角色。另外，以微電子製程技術
所架構的流體設備，諸如應用在基因分析與化學偵測時，需要精確地測量流體的
體積，所以對於微小尺寸液滴的控制方法是發展該類技術的核心之一。液滴在這
種微小尺寸時，是否會產生合併現象，或是液滴會分裂為多個更微小尺寸的液
滴，這種過程的發生機制，是值得深入探討的。最近，液滴的抑制合併與抑制潤
濕現象，在新的相關應用上找到發展空間，諸如焦距可變化的液體透鏡在光學儀
器的應用，非潤濕液體在低負載環境下當作低摩擦係數軸承的應用。所以，確認
非潤濕機制、分析間隙薄膜流場、探討液滴自由表面與未來可能應用，成為許多
學者欲研究的重點。 
非濕潤及非融合現象必須建立在通以潤滑氣體的薄膜之液體-液體或者液體
-固體表面間，且液體需要不斷的補充使其保持濕潤。透過不同的溫度操控，使
得在壁面內的兩顆液滴產生具有潤滑氣體的薄膜。因此，當實際進入液滴-液滴
或者液滴-固體表面是被區分開來的。如圖 1[1]。 
Napolitano等人[2]於1985年在火箭上進行低重力的液橋(Liquid Bridge)之馬
諾哥尼對流(Marangoni convection or Thermocapillary convection)實驗中，嘗試將
意外分裂成兩個液滴之液橋重新接合時，發現因兩個液滴存有溫差而無法重新再
接合。由Neitzel與Dell’Aversana[3]等學者對兩相同種類之液滴相互接觸的研究發
現，當兩水滴間具有溫度差時，相互接近的兩水滴各自在其表面上產生溫度梯度
而在水滴表面上造成熱毛細(Thermocapillary)流，而此流動將會帶動液滴周圍的
氣體而在兩液滴間產生一氣體潤滑層(Lubricating Film)，形成足夠壓力導致兩液
滴產生不融合(Noncoalescence)的現象。 
Dell’Aversana等人[4-5]發現在特定溫差下，兩液滴可承受特定的力，產生一

細部機制。由於氣膜厚度只有幾個微米，所以很難以實驗方法量測氣膜內之速度
及溫度分佈，所以找出適當的理論及數值模擬方法，對捲入氣體所造成之非潤濕
效應機制之了解應有助益。在進行此問題之理論分析或數值模擬所遭遇到主要困
難有三項，氣膜厚度O(μm)與液滴的尺寸O(mm)上的顯著差異，液氣介面位置是
未知，是解的一部分，氣體與液體流場是互相耦合。這些困難造成使用數值模擬
進行分析此方面問題的障礙。 
再者，先前之實驗或數值模擬分析，研究液滴表面之熱毛細對流所造成之非
潤濕效應，多以液滴(直徑為2~3 mm)與液滴相互作用或液滴與平滑表面的相互作
用為主，並未深任入分析因液滴大小、表面材質及結構對捲氣效應所造成非潤濕
效應之影響。而近幾年來，由於蓮花效應 [9-10](Lotus-Effect)的高度疏水性
(Superhydrophobic)現象與表面自潔效應(Self-Cleaning)[11]的研究，皆是利用在疏
水性表面上製造微結構或改變材質來增加其接觸角(Contact Angle)以達到親水性
的目的，所以表面結構及材質改變對捲氣效應所造成非潤濕效應之影響應深入研
究。除了接觸角改變之效應，粗糙表面對液滴與固體表面間氣流場所造成的影
響，亦是應深入加以了解。 
Neitzel和Dell’Aversana針對流體動力所造成的液滴非接合和非潤濕行為，做
過詳盡的評論[1]。由於有空氣薄膜，介於液滴表面之間，或液滴與固體表面之
間，使得液滴與液滴之間，看似接合但卻又未發生接觸；或液滴與固體之間，看
似接觸卻又不潤濕。這種非接合和非潤濕的行為，可以依其發生時間的長短，區
分為暫時狀態和永久狀態，亦可依照互斥作用力區分為流體動力、電荷、凡德瓦
力(van der Waals)和DLVO。在永久狀態的非接合和非潤濕中，可以藉由控制液
體與液體或液體與固體間的，溫度差異或相對切線速度，使得潤滑流體連續不斷
地供應而不會被耗盡。第一種情況，因溫度誘發表面張力梯度產生熱毛細
(Marangoni)應力，可以造成潤滑流體源源不斷地被供應到間隙薄膜內，使得非接
合或是非潤濕的表面分隔開，這種現象被稱為”自我潤滑(self-lubrication)”。第二
種情況，藉由利用強制的相對切線運動，亦可提供潤滑流體，使得間隙薄膜內持

其在理論可以達到無限行程的自走功能，最後一種是採用材料變形的方式，以撓
性結構設計能放大位移的機構。前兩種方式的優點在於可以達到長行程移動的目
的，不過由於其歩進運動需要依賴摩擦力，因而在定位精度上並不容易控制；第
三種方式則擁有非常高的定位精度，但是行程短卻是其致命傷，往往只有數百微
米的移動範圍。為了同時達到足夠的行程與極高的精度，因此發展出雙層複式驅
動平台，其即是結合兩組性能不同的致動器，其中具有長行程性能的致動器，負
責主要的定位行程，另一組具有高精度性能的致動器，則進行誤差的補償與修
正，使位移系統兼顧長行程與高精度，進而將此平台應用於雷射干涉微影系統中。 
因微定位平台以壓電致動器提供致動力，當壓電致動器受電壓驅動而伸長其
尺寸時，進而將驅動平台，因為壓電材料本身之剛性相關大，其致動器與平台接
觸的前後端皆會產生彈性變形(如圖3所示)，平台實際向前定位的位移輸出會小
於致動器所貢獻給平台的位移輸入，此前後彈性變形現象會造成平台位移損失，
即平台的位移輸入會小於壓電致動位移輸出。於精密定位過程中，當平台存在位
移損失時，會使得其系統定位性能下降，於干涉曝光時會使得兩曝光點交界處微
結構產生彎曲現象，如何解決兩曝光交接區域因定位誤差所造成的微結構彎曲現
象，使雷射干涉微影系統穩定製作出不同週期的大面積週期性微結構，以供後續
進行接觸表面上存在著不同型態的微結構時，對於液滴表面之熱毛細對流或剪力
作用所造成之非潤濕效應的研究直得深入探討。 
過去有很多的研究關於非濕潤及非融合現象的探討[2,4,6,8,15-17]，關於這個
非濕潤及非潤滑現象指出，不同的溫度函數在兩個非連接的表面之間，液滴的尺
寸、兩個表面的相對距離以及液體與氣體之特性[4,6,8,15-17]。Napolitano 等學者
指出 [2]在實驗時，虛弱的流動也許是破壞液橋連結在一起的主要原因。
Dell’Aversana 等學者指出[4,15]即使是不同的溫度都必須使 5 cSt 矽-油液滴的反
壓大於 3K，才能保持非連結的狀態。通常不同的液體特性是妨害潤滑現象的主
因[8]，當液體的黏滯性增加，不同溫度的閥值濃度就會跟著變大進而產生熱毛
細連結，其目的是為了維持住潤滑薄膜。當液體是 100 cSt 矽-油時，潤滑會發生

由表面的速度包含液滴內部的熱毛細現象流場，它是使用在推估在相同高度位置
下的氣體流場。然而，它卻忽視變形的自由表面流場，推估氣體附近的流場及假
設潤滑薄膜這樣是不會得到任何有實際可能的解答。此外，在 Dell’Aversana 等
學者的實驗中[3,5,17]證明液滴存在於潤滑薄膜中如圖所示 1 及圖 5。因此，藉由
熱毛細現象指出非連接現象就是當兩個液滴在相對的位子並且位互相的擠壓及
堆動。 
由於過去於液滴表面之熱毛細力或剪力作用所造成之非潤濕效應的研究
中，大多針對液滴與平滑接觸表面間氣流場的流動現象進行分析，而在疏水性表
面的研究中，為了得到超疏水性(Superhydrophobic)表面，常見的方式便是於疏水
性表面上製作微結構或表面材質的改變，然而當接觸表面上存在著微結構時，對
於液滴表面之熱毛細對流或剪力作用所造成之非潤濕效應，大多數研究皆以透過
溫度差來驅動液滴表面之熱毛細力造成捲氣效應，除了由溫度梯度所產生熱毛細
流之非潤濕效應外，亦可由液滴與固體之相對運動，經由剪力(Shear Force)作用，
把氣體捲入液滴與固體之間，而造成非潤濕(Non-Wetting)效應。 
利用數值方法，分析受到剪力作用影響下，微米尺寸的液滴所發生的抑制合
併與潤濕現象。同時，為了研究當接觸表面上存在著微結構或時，對於液滴表面
之熱毛細對流或剪力作用所造成之非潤濕效應，我們透過發展精密微定位技術來
配合雷射光干涉微影系統，於傳統雷射光干涉微影系統中加入雙層複合式定位平
台以進行大面積微結構製作，解決兩曝光交接區域因定位誤差所造成的微結構彎
曲現象，穩定製作出不同週期的大面積一維週期性微結構，以供後續進行接觸表
面上存在著不同型態的微結構時，對於液滴表面之熱毛細對流或剪力作用所造成
之非潤濕效應的研究。 
然而熱毛細現象傳送扮演著很重要的腳色，就是潤滑氣體膜薄中的非連接以
及非潤滑的現象。它會拖著氣體進入薄膜中的空隙，不只是阻止液滴融合並且還
會在氣體薄膜中產生高壓的自由表面。此外，熱毛細現象傳送總是會受到溫度不
同的影響。它的相對距離在非接觸表面液滴液體特性以及周圍的氣體之間。因

液氣介面移動問題的研究，先後發表數十篇相關論文，包含如何使用數值方法決
定液氣介面的位置[21]，使用所發展的數值方法探討液橋及矩形長穴之熱張力對
流問題[22-25]，及浮點式長晶系統之熱張力對流問題[26-28]，可由此經驗很容易
延伸解決氣體與液體流場間互相耦合之問題。有關氣膜厚度與液滴尺寸差異過大
造成分析上的困難，本研究將使用有限元素法，根據物理量變化建立不均勻格點
分佈，在液氣自由表面間加密格點來解決此一問題，圖6為我們初步所建構及使
用格點分佈。流體仍假設為牛頓流體，由於氣膜厚度O(μm)時，初步估算之
Knudsen number小於10-2，所以連續體模式及不滑動邊界條件仍可適用。我們初
步針對附在一平面之半圓液滴與固體表面存在一速度梯度，亦是存在剪力作用之
情形，進行初步模擬。圖7為初步模擬之流線及速度分佈情形。 
及依照所欲分析的物理模型，建立一個正確的幾何模型(如圖8所示)，本研
究的計算過程，液珠的初始半徑為1 mm、液珠與平板在對稱軸上的初始距離為
0.01 mm，並且在無重力場影響的狀況之下，液珠自由液面的起始形狀為圓弧形
狀。然後將這個幾何模型做適當的網格化處理，因為在液珠的自由表面附近流場
是研究的重點，所以在該區域的網格化密度較高，而在遠離液珠自由表面的網格
化密度就逐漸降低。並設定複雜四邊形元素做網格化，在不增加網格化密度的情
況下以提高計算的精度。接著，配合物理模型的描述，設定幾何模型中各種圖素
的屬性；流體(液珠面積、空氣面積)，邊界(高溫平板線段、低溫平板線段)、自
由液面(液珠弧線)，並將這些不同屬性的圖素設定不同的名稱，以便後續處理時
可以區別。 
此外，我們以Galerkin運算程序及有限元素離散的定義，將連立的統馭方程
式改寫成一個整體係數矩陣(global coefficient matrics)方程式，並以分離法
(segregated method)將大域矩陣分解成一些較小的次矩陣(sub-matrices)，且這些次
矩陣各自代表不同統馭方程式的未知解。並依次(sequential)將這些矩陣以高斯
(Gaussian)消去法求解各未知的自由度。在以分離法解統御方程式時，將壓力和
其他自由度(u、v、w、T)同樣視為變數，當整體係數矩陣分解成較小的次矩陣過

光強度與曝光時間便可在顯影後得到相同週期但不同結構密度之週期性結構。因
此本研究後續將透過此系統建構出不同變化之表面結構。 
此外，本計劃亦透過數值模擬的方式[29]，計算不同製程條件下曝光後光阻
內部光活性化合物相對濃度分佈的情形，分別針對調變曝光時間控制週期性微結
構之線寬、曝光區域內不同位置之週期性微結構線寬的影響等進行分析，在依此
分析數據做為平台移動距離的依據，得到整體移動曝光範圍內均勻之週期性微結
構。最終利用矽基材半導體成熟技術，透過干涉微影技術製作微結構光阻在矽晶
圓表面上，透過感應耦合電漿蝕刻系統蝕刻出不同深度之結構。再針對不同的材
質選用不同的蝕刻方式，在其表面上製作微結構。因此，不同物質下之最佳化之
製程參數的取得亦為本研究不可忽略的重點之一。 
 
(3)微定位系統設計分析 
欲使用壓電致動器驅動一微定位機構以進行精密定位，用以解決兩曝光交接
區域因定位誤差所造成的微結構彎曲現象，其中微定位機構的設計概念主要是由
兩對平板式撓性結構所組成，圖10為其結構示意圖，中央實心部代表可以置放晶
圓或是鏡組物件等，裸露中空部份可置入壓電致動器當驅動源。當壓電致動器受
電壓驅動而伸長其尺寸時，進而將驅動平台，因為壓電材料本身之剛性相關大，
其致動器與平台接觸的前後端皆會產生彈性變形，如是，平台實際向前定位的位
移輸出會小於致動器所貢獻給平台的位移輸入，此前後彈性變形現象會造成平台
位移損失，即平台的位移輸入會小於壓電致動位移輸出。於精密定位過程中，當
平台存在位移損失時，會使得其系統定位性能下降，故於平台結構設計時，將此
影響先考慮進去，使壓電致動平台位移損失能達到最小。因此，為了得到最合適
的平板彈簧結構參數，使能減少壓電平台定位時因前後結構變形所造成的位移損
失，我們使用最佳化技巧配合有限元素分析軟體，求得最佳的平板彈簧結構幾何
參數[30]。 
於本計劃中我們採用田口法去計算平板定位平台的最佳化尺寸，選用的直交

    在先前的研究方法中，僅探討空間中只有一顆液滴的狀態，當物理問題擴展
到兩顆液滴時，其所使用的數值方法須要有所改變，因此，在後續的探討中，採
用下列的數值方法來分析，以得到正確的研究結果。 
兩個同樣大小的矽油滴與周圍的空氣都位於矩形的截面 W×H (圖 11)。一個
被固定在較低的表面有較高的溫度，另一個於位於上方有較低的溫度。液氣介面

數法在其他時沒有相同的適應特性，等位函數法的主要優勢是在於容易地計算介

ΔT = 10、30 and 50 ℃，自由表面上的溫度，結果速度( 22 ν+= uVs )，以及壓力
差( la PPP −=Δ )的分佈圖。比較圖13a 中的溫度分佈曲線，可以觀察到提高ΔT 會
造成熱毛細對流的增強。在靠近冷物體表面(x = 0)與熱物體表面(x = 1)附近的溫
度變化，ΔT 越高的，這種溫度變化就越明顯；在遠離物體表面區域，溫度變化
就較小。由圖13b 中可以發現在接觸線(±1, 0)，自由表面的結果速度為零(如同邊
界件數學式所述)；另一個出現速度為零的位置是在停滯點(0, S(0))，這裡的壓力
差出現最大值圖13c。當ΔT 增加時，自由表面的結果速度也會明顯地增加；所
以，ΔT 增加時動壓也會隨之變大。另外，在靠近停滯點時，壓力差會突然地增
加，是因為當動壓減少時，靜壓會隨著增大。所以，隨著ΔT 增加，靠近停滯點
附近的壓力差會增加。但同樣是在ΔT 較大的情況時，遠離停滯點的壓力差反而
變得比較小，這是因為當計算條件為= 20 ℃，D = 1.01 mm，且ΔT = 10、30和50℃
時，水珠自由表面的溫度，結果速度，與壓力差分佈，如圖14 所示。水珠的自
由表面溫度分佈圖14a 與矽油的趨勢圖13a 相類似。在靠近冷物體表面附近，水
珠的自由表面溫度比相同條件下的矽油溫度高；也就是說水珠的潤滑薄膜會有較
大的溫度變化，這可以從比較圖13a 與圖14a 的對應曲線得知。定義特定液體的
馬諾哥尼數為 αμ
γ TRMa Δ=  [34]，較大的馬諾哥尼數代表較強的熱毛細對流。在ΔT 
= 30 ℃時，水的馬諾哥尼數( 50600=Δ= αμ
γ TRMa )。所以當ΔT 相同時，水珠內的
熱毛細對流會比矽油還強大。於是，水的自由表面結果速度(圖14b)高於相對應

修正前次系統之輸出誤差，再將訊號傳至H∞控制器，藉由H∞控制器進行系統訊
號處理，最後再將訊號輸出至定位系統上。完成控制器設計後，將期代入之前所
得之壓電模型中，利用MATLAB之系統模擬功能，來了解控制器之補償能力。
由圖17所示，可得知系統之位移誤差隨著學習次數增加而逐漸減少。最後觀察此
系統對外界干擾的抵抗能力，加入佔輸入命令大小20%的隨機干擾(±1μm)後所得
之結果，觀察其輸出位移表現，可發現透過重複學習後，其可抑制外界輸入的雜
訊，如圖18所示。上述結果可知，所設計的學習控制器結合H∞控制器在針對系
統加入外界干擾後，仍具備精密定位能力，且其抑制干擾能力極佳，驗證所設計
之控制器符合性能規格，在配合本實驗室建立的雷射光干涉微影模型後，可穩定
的製作出大面積的週期性微結構。 
 
(3)微結構製作製程條件模擬分析 
本計劃亦透過數值模擬的方式，計算不同製程條件下的微結構尺寸與形狀，
使用雷射光干涉微影技術製作光阻微結構時，為了得到曝光面積內部(直徑約
5mm 的圓)光阻與光反應之物理特性，因此本研究由曝光中心(高斯光強度最強
的部分，位置1)以曝光光源波長的整數倍(間隔約0.5mm)向外依序取四點(2~5)，
進行分析與探討。 
當干涉角度固定後，則其週期亦隨之固定。而干涉強度在空間中的分佈為一
高斯函數與餘弦函數的耦合，因此我們可藉由調變曝光強度與曝光時間來控制某
一週期內部相對光活性化合物濃度(M)的分佈，表四為曝光數學模型所選用的參
數。 
本研究皆設定光阻微結構厚度為1.5μm作為模擬的條件，圖19為曝光時間47
秒於位置一所對應之光阻表面光強度與光阻內部M變化之情形。由圖19很明顯的
看出光阻內部M之分佈將隨著其所對應的曝光強度變化，而在本研究中，僅討論
曝光的條件，因此我們在此做了一個簡單且合理的假設，假設M≦0.4時光阻將
完全地被鹼性的顯影劑所中和，而此假設雖會讓我們對週期性結構的頂端之外型

(4)等溫潤濕抑制數值模擬分析 
    在等溫潤濕抑制的研究中，分別以半徑R = 1 mm半圓形的水和5 cSt矽油為液
滴的流體做為討論。圖7a所顯示的是V = 300 mm/s與D = 1.01 mm時以矽油為液滴
的流線與速度向量。在本計劃中以端牆移動的方向為下游。靠近移動端牆附近的
空氣，因為受到黏滯力的作用，於是也會向下游方向流動。部份的空氣直接流過
液滴與移動端牆之間的間隙，部份會衝擊在液滴的表面上，沿著液滴表面做逆時
針方向流動，最後會因壓力梯度的存在，而沿著固定端牆表面，向上游方向流動。
於是在入口端的速度向量(圖7b)，呈現出二維Couette-Poiseuille 式的分佈。至於
在間隙薄膜內，空氣的速度剖面由移動端牆向液體表面遞減(圖7c)。空氣通過薄
膜最窄部份後，因為通道逐漸變寬，所以速度逐漸減緩。在下游端空氣的呈現與
上游端空氣相似的行為，沿著固定端牆向上游流動，然後再延著液體表面流動，
與構成潤滑薄膜的空氣合併，最後流向出口，入口端的速度向量如圖7d所示。定
義空氣的流率(flow rate)為 ∫= udyq ，在入口、間隙薄膜、出口等處均可獲得相
同的數值(2.463mm2/s)，可證明質量守恆。Smith和Neitzel以多重尺度模型計算相
同的邊界條件，所得之空氣流率為2.491mm2 /s，驗證與本研究結果近似。 
自由表面上的壓力差分佈如圖24b所示，在x = 0.2和x = -0.15附近分別出現局
部最大值，但這裡並不是停滯點，且這些局部極大值出現的位置，會隨著端牆移
動速度V的增加而稍向下游移動。靠近上游端的壓力差局部極大值會隨著端牆移
動速度增加而變大，是因為更快速度的空氣衝擊在自由表面上所造成。壓力差的
極小值在x = 0.2和x = -0.15之間出現，這是因為間隙薄膜厚度變小時，空氣速度
會變大。 
圖25是端牆之間距離固定(D=1.01mm)且移動端牆速度變化(V =300,400與
500 mm/s)的條件下，水珠的結果圖。所有計算曲線的分佈趨勢與圖7結果類似。
將雷諾數定義為 μ
ρVR=Re ，這是慣性力和黏滯力的相對重要性比較量度。在速

最後兩項振型為tension modes。 
爲了得到平板彈簧平台的真實自然頻率及其振型，我們進行頻譜分析實驗以
求得平台的自然頻率及其真實振型。頻譜分析實驗系統架構如圖29所示，我們使
用一衝擊槌(PCB, Model 086C01)產生輸入訊號，同時將一三軸加速規(PCB, 
Model 356A13, 5mV/g)黏貼於定位平台上以接收平台之輸出訊號，將上述四通道
訊號連接至一串聯之頻譜訊號分析儀上(DSP tech. Inc. Series x 2 Model20-22A)，
以進行訊號擷取與運算分析，測量之頻寬範圍設定在2KHz 內，測量28 個節點
數據，單點平均實驗次數設定為三次。衝擊槌產生一脈衝訊號激發平板彈簧定位
平台，同時三軸加速規感測得到平台的振動訊號，該振動訊號將透過頻譜分析儀
內部的DSP 進行運算並轉換成頻率響應函數。 
我們將頻譜分析儀所得到的頻率響應函數匯入ME'scope頻譜分析軟體換算
求得系統真實的自然頻率、阻尼比與平台的振型。圖30為平板彈簧定位平台之前
六項自然頻率頻譜圖，其前六項自然頻率分別為753 Hz, 968 Hz. 1220 Hz, 1510 
Hz, 1728 Hz, 1820 Hz。此外，系統真實振型如圖31所示，其第一與第二模態振型
為bending modes，第三與第四模態振型為torsion modes，第五與第六模態振型為
tension modes，雖然實驗所得之前六項自然頻率值皆略低於有限元素分析所得之
值，但實驗所得之前六個振型與有限元素分析所得之振型皆相符，且其振動方向
一致。由此可知，其實驗與模擬之結果約相差5%，我們可將其視為一合理之實
驗誤差。 
完成定位平台的模態實驗後，進一步我們設計了H∞控制器與ILC控制器並將
其相結合，其系統的控制流程如下圖16所示。由圖可知系統會藉由ILC來產生每
一次的新訊號，新的控制訊號皆會修正前次系統之輸出誤差，再將訊號傳至H∞
控制器，藉由H∞控制器進行系統訊號處理，最後再將訊號輸出至定位系統上。
完成控制器設計後，我們進行了大面積微結構製作實驗(系統架構圖如圖32所
示)，用以了解控制器之補償能力使否可解決兩曝光交接區域因定位誤差所造成
的微結構彎曲現象，由圖17所示，可得知系統之位移誤差隨著學習次數增加而逐
  27
角度的定義如圖35，在頂點是相當於0度和在液滴的接觸點是100度。 
(a)溫差的影響 
在這例子，計算用相同的間隙薄膜厚度D = 0.05mm和20 cSt的矽油黏性對三
種溫差ΔT = 47K、57K和77K進行。結果如圖36，指出下方的液滴在靠近停滯點
(θ = 0)處表面溫度變化較大(圖36a)，和上方的低滴在接觸點(θ = 100) (圖36b)，然
而表面的溫地梯度遠小於這些點。尤其，對較大ΔT的例子，這些變化更是重要。
這表明，當溫差增加將導致增加表面張力梯度自由表面的水滴，可提高熱毛細對
流。 
在不同溫度的差異下，圖37顯示在自由表面液滴的速度分佈。自由表面速度
的大小為零的接觸點(θ= 100)，於此項規定的邊界條件和在停滯點(θ = 0)。在速
度接近低液滴的停滯點和上面的聯絡點較大，因為較高的表面溫度梯度。顯然，
當溫度差異增加，自由表面速度顯著增加，無論是兩個水滴。在上方液滴的自由
表面速度(圖37b)一般小於低的(圖37a)，因為它具有較小的表面溫度梯度。 
因此，藉由矽油運動帶動空氣的運動將擴大和增強的熱毛細對流一起。壓力
對液滴的自由表面也受到影響。在這，表面壓力ΔP是定義為空氣和矽油的壓力
差(ΔP = Pa – Pl)。下方液滴在停滯點(θ= 0)和上方液滴的接觸點(θ= 100)表面壓力
最大。因為當ΔT增加，因而自由表面速度顯著增加。這表示更大的ΔT會增加動
態壓力。在下方的自由表面(圖38a)，當接近停滯點，表面壓力增加。這是因為
當動壓下降則靜態壓力上升。因此，當ΔT變大，停滯點的表面壓力增加。較高ΔT，
位置遠離停滯點的壓力較小，因為他擁有較高的動態壓力。對於上方液滴(圖
38b)，當接近接觸點，表面的壓力顯著增加。這就像下方液滴，當他的動壓下降
則靜態壓力上升。然而，當ΔT增加，在接觸點表面壓力增加。 
壓力的分佈如圖38，也證明最大的表面壓力存在於下方液滴的停滯點，當上
方液滴的停滯點擁有較小的壓力。這意味著，最大的壓力不存在為潤滑空氣薄膜
的中心，在空氣的潤滑膜中，它的存在是更接近於熱液滴比冷的。 
在熱毛細對流的影響以及表面壓力會導致液滴形狀的變形(如圖39)。從液滴
  29
更穩定。 
(c)不同矽油黏度的影響 
在這一部分，已完成計算不同的矽油黏度(20 cSt、10 cSt和5 cSt)。液氣介面
的形變以及融合抑制能力再次將研究。在這些計算，施加溫差在冷熱表面之間是
57 K和間隙厚度D是0.05 mm。 
當矽油的黏度下降，熱毛細對流影響的熱能傳輸將沒有較大矽油黏度例子顯
著。此外，當黏度較小時，能量傳遞過程將受熱傳導時影響更多。計算結果如圖
45所示，證明在液滴的自由表面增加溫度的結果是減少矽油的黏度。 
此外，Marangoni數在這種情況下的定義是
ll
T
μα
TRγMa Δ= ，一個更大的
Marangoni 數顯示出更強的熱毛細對流。在此情況下，該 Marangoni 數為Ma = 
1357, 2363, 5679。因此，當矽油黏度降低時，矽油液滴內的熱毛細對流更是有力。
因此，液滴的自由表面速度顯著增加(圖46)。 
結果與實驗結果有好的協議，其中在液滴的自由表面，液體黏度的減少會加
快運動，以及促使空氣進入間隙薄膜防止融合。當黏度降低時，自由表面速度的
增加對表面壓力的影響，如圖47。在停滯點下方液滴以及在上方液滴的接觸點，
較大的自由面速度將產生一個更高的壓力。 
隨著強烈矽油的熱毛細對流，上下液滴的液氣介面形變顯著擴大，如圖48。
在這，當矽油的黏度降低，毛細數增加(Ca= 0.14，0.18，0.20)。作為結果，抑制
融合能力繼續增強，是藉由強烈的空氣運動席捲矽油運動到間隙薄膜。 
 
四、結論 
在這項研究中，目前已進行藉由熱毛細對流所致非融合矽油液滴的數值模
擬。周圍空氣和矽油流場的合效應已經計算成功。模型在液氣介面形變的計算有
展示好的結果。當溫差加於冷熱表面之間，熱毛細對流將在兩液滴間產生潤滑空
氣薄膜。因此，兩液滴表面從形成接觸處被分開。非融合的狀態因此保持。也成

計畫成果自評 
(1)研究內容與原計畫相符程度 
此次計畫主要透過數值模擬，了解熱毛細對流所造成二矽油滴之非融合現
象，及考慮在抑制融合下，溫差的影響、介於二液滴間的間隙薄膜厚度和矽油黏
度對熱毛細對流的能力。增加溫差、減少間隙薄膜的厚度和減少液體的粘度，可
以提高熱毛細對流能力。較強的熱毛細對流也可能擴大液氣介面的形變，因此，
兩液滴表面從形成接觸處被分開，非融合的狀態因此保持，由矽油到潤滑空氣薄
膜的運動將會提高空氣捲入速度。並成功地計算出來流場內部的液體與氣體相。 
除此之外，以數值方法模擬剪應力環境下的等溫潤濕抑制。計算與實驗結果
相符，矽油或水的液滴在靠近移動的端牆時，會產生非潤濕現象。端牆與液滴表
面之間的＂近乎接觸(apparent contact)＂區域，可藉由增加端牆速度或是減少端
牆與液滴相對距離而增大。矽油液滴因為具有比水珠更大的韋伯數(Weber 
number)，所以更容易受到非潤濕效應的影響。透過改善壁面的速度或者是減少

Dell’Aversana et al. [2] measured the shape of the
liquid–gas interface of a drop pressed against a solid sur-
face by means of laser interferometry. When the drop
exhibits nonwetting behavior a dimple appears, which
deepens and widens as the load increases; this has also been
observed for cases of noncoalescence. The thickness of the
interstitial gas ﬁlm is of the order of a few microns for a
5 · 103 m diameter silicone-oil drop. Since it is very diﬃ-
cult to observe or measure the velocity and temperature
ﬁelds inside this gas ﬁlm, an appropriate theoretical
treatment is needed to better understand the inﬂuence of
the gas motion on these noncoalescence nonwetting pheno-
mena.
Sumner et al. [6] have examined the liquid and gas ﬂows
in a two-dimensional nonwetting drop using lubrication
theory, which is only suitable for an ideal slender drop with
smaller thermocapillary convection. They ﬁnd that the
presence of a central dimple observed experimentally
requires the inclusion of inertia to be present.
Simulations of a nonwetting droplet are complicated by
the disparity of length scales involved. Typical droplet sizes
are of O (mm) while ﬁlm thicknesses are O (lm). Numeri-
cal simulations of thermocapillary-driven noncoalescence
and nonwetting were performed by Monti et al. [7,8]. They
neglected ﬂow-induced free-surface deformation, calculat-
ing the ﬂow in the surrounding gas. However, the shape
of free surface was not updated using results from gas-ﬂow
calculations in conjunction with the normal-stress bound-
ary condition. The present simulation computes ﬂows in
the liquid and gas phases simultaneously, adjusting the
interface position through the use of the stress boundary
conditions imposed thereon.
In the present study, the commercial code FIDAP based
on ﬁnite element techniques has been employed to perform
a numerical simulation of thermocapillary wetting suppres-
sion. FIDAP has proven useful for problems involving
thermocapillary ﬂow [9]. The physical problem considered
here is a two-dimensional liquid drop attached to a support
and pressed against a wall held at a diﬀerent temperature.
This case corresponds to that treated experimentally by
Nalevanko [10] and examined theoretically using lubrica-
tion theory by Sumner et al. [6]. As mentioned above, the
ﬂow in both the gas and liquid phases must be computed
simultaneously to simulate thermocapillary nonwetting.
We explore the velocity and thermal ﬁelds within both
the lubricating ﬁlm and the liquid drop. A steady-state
solution is also discussed, with many parameters being con-
sidered, i.e., the drop/wall temperature diﬀerences and rel-

were examined, and the use of 3310 elements demonstrated
the best combination of accuracy and computation time.
To solve the diﬃculty of disparate length scales associated
with droplet and interstitial ﬁlm, an appropriate ﬁner mesh
is applied near the free surface in both liquid and gas ﬁelds,
as shown in Fig. 2; the nodes on the free surface are permit-
ted to move in the direction of the local normal. The above
partial-diﬀerential equations and boundary conditions
were discretized using the Galerkin ﬁnite-element method
(GFEM) and the resulting nonlinear algebraic equations
were then solved using the uncoupled (i.e., segregated-
solver) method. Each degree of freedom was solved sepa-
rately. The associated ﬂow problem was solved while the
appropriate boundary condition was ﬁxed; iterations were
continued until velocity convergence to within a preset tol-
erance (less than 106) was satisﬁed. The location of the
free surface was updated using the normal-stress balance.
This procedure was repeated until the position of the free
surface converged. A combination of relaxing the pressure
and the use of an upwinding scheme was introduced to pre-
vent unphysical wiggles in the ﬂow solution.
The simulation methodology developed by the present
approach based on the FIDAP has been used to compute
the isothermal wetting suppression case in the presence of
shear when a drop approaches a moving wall [13]. Smith
and Neitzel [14] develop a hybrid numerical model employ-
ing lubrication theory for the interstitial ﬁlm and numerical
simulation for the liquid and outer gas ﬁelds. The deﬁ-
ciency of their model is that the net ﬂow rate of gas ﬁeld
must provide artiﬁcially. On the contrary, the present
model is without this limitation. With the same physical
conditions, those from the two models agree quite well.
3. Results and discussion
Simulations were performed to investigate the surface
deformation of a semicircular drop immersed in air with
an initial radius of R = 1 · 103 m. The inﬂuences of the
temperature diﬀerence DT and the distance D between
the two parallel walls were determined. The liquids consid-
ered were 5 cSt silicone-oil and water; their physical prop-
erties are listed in Table 1.
The thermocapillary nonwetting experiments [2] have
been conducted by imposing a constant temperature diﬀer-
ence of 35 C between a droplet attached to a heated rod
pressed against a cooled glass surface. The temperature dif-
ference cannot be too large (which depends on the volatility
of the liquid employed) to minimize evaporation of liquid
from the droplet. With the experiments in mind, the tem-
perature diﬀerence between hot and cold walls is selected
for the present computations to be DT = 10, 30, and
50 C. The numerical computation exhibited problems with
convergence of the solution when the distance between two
walls is less than 1.01 · 103 m. The experimental results [2]
also reveal that the interstitial ﬁlm thickness measured by
interferometry is O (lm). Hence, the distance between
two walls is chosen for the computations to be
D = 1.01 · 103, 1.03 · 103, and 1.05 · 103 m.

walls is smaller, especially for a larger DT. The magnitude
of the resultant free-surface velocity (Fig. 4(b)) is zero at
the contact lines (x,y) = (±1,0), as required by boundary
condition (11), while another zero-velocity point appears
at the stagnation point (x,y) = (0,S(0)), where the maxi-
mum pressure diﬀerence is observed (Fig. 4(c)). The veloc-
ity increases signiﬁcantly when DT is increased, indicating
the dynamic pressure is higher for a larger DT. The pres-
sure diﬀerence increases dramatically when the stagnation
point is approached because the static pressure increases
as the dynamic pressure decreases. Therefore, as DT
becomes large, the pressure diﬀerence near the stagnation
point increases. The pressure diﬀerence for the position
away from the stagnation point is smaller for higher DT,
since it possesses a higher dynamic pressure.
The temperature, resultant velocity, and pressure diﬀer-
ence distributions on a water free surface are shown in
Fig. 5, where TC = 20 C and D = 1.01 · 103 m, with
DT = 10, 30, and 50 C. The trend for the temperature dis-
tribution of water (Fig. 5(a)) is similar to that of silicone oil
(Fig. 4(a)). Near the cold wall, the corresponding free-sur-
face temperature of water is higher than that of silicone oil,
i.e., a more signiﬁcant temperature drop-oﬀ exists in the
lubricating ﬁlm for water, for the same DT, as can be seen
by comparing the curves in Figs. 4 and 5(a). The Marang-
oni number for this situation is deﬁned as Mal ¼ cl;TDTRalll [12],
a larger Marangoni number indicative of stronger thermo-
capillary convection. At DT = 30 C, the Marangoni num-
ber of water Maw ¼ cw;TDTRawlw ¼ 50600
 
is much larger than
that of silicone oil Mas ¼ cs;TDTRasls ¼ 10064
 
. Therefore,
the thermocapillary convection inside a water drop is more
vigorous than that inside a silicone-oil drop experiencing
the same DT. Hence, the free-surface velocity of water
(Fig. 5(b)) is much larger than the corresponding one for
silicone-oil (Fig. 4(b)). In turn, this makes the pressure dif-
ference for water (Fig. 5(c)) greater than that for silicone-
oil (Fig. 4(c)).
We also investigate the eﬀect of the distance between the
cold wall and the vertex of a hot drop. Fig. 6 shows the
inﬂuence of diﬀerent distances (D = 1.01 · 103,
1.03 · 103, and 1.05 · 103 m) for a silicone-oil drop with
DT = 30 C. The thermal resistance of the interstitial ﬁlm
will decrease as its thickness decreases. This explains why
the temperature gradients are enlarged for a smaller D, as
observed in Fig. 6(a). Obviously, decreasing D can enhance
the strength of the thermocapillary ﬂow by increasing the
surface-temperature gradients near the drop vertex and
contact lines. As D decreases, the velocities along the free
surface are larger (Fig. 6(b)), while the pressure diﬀerence
varies accordingly (Fig. 6(c)). The trends for water drops
are similar to those for silicone-oil drops.
The distance r(x) from the origin to a point on the free
surface is plotted as a function of x in Fig. 7(a), indicating
that the silicone-oil drop forms a dimple at the stagnation
point, resulting in a bulge away from this point. These phe-
nomena become more notable as DT increases, for
D = 1.01 · 103 m and DT = 10, 30, and 50 C. The capil-
lary number, deﬁned as Cal ¼ cl;TDTcl , represents the ratio of
thermocapillary to capillary forces; the amount of free-sur-
face deformation is proportional to the capillary number.
Obviously, the capillary number increases as DT is
enlarged. The stress acting on the free surface is decom-
posed into normal and tangential components in order to
explain the free-surface distortion and the resultant veloc-
ity on it. The net normal stress rn increases as x! 0
(Fig. 7(b)), because the static pressure is large there. When
DT increases, the diﬀerence between normal stresses at the
stagnation point and contact line is increased, resulting in a
stronger pinching eﬀect at the stagnation point than that at
the contact line leading to greater apparent deformation.

The experiments reported on in [1–3] were concerned with
the axisymmetric analog of the 2-D problem treated here,
so a direct quantitative comparison is not possible; the 2-
D experiments of Nalevanko [10] do not provide data of
suﬃcient detail to support a quantitative comparison.
For DT = 30 C with D = 1.01 · 103 m, the capillary
number of silicone oil (Cas = 0.1077) is larger than that
of water (Caw = 0.066). Therefore, the nonwetting eﬀect
for silicone is more signiﬁcant.
The wall distance D inﬂuences the free-surface deforma-
tion of the silicone-oil drop, as shown in Fig. 9(a), for a
ﬁxed DT = 30 C. There is an increased surface-tempera-
ture gradient for a smaller D, because the thermal resis-
tance of the lubricating ﬁlm decreases. Therefore, r(0)
(=S(0)) decreases as D decreases. The net normal stress
increases with decreasing D as x! 0 (Fig. 9(b)), exhibiting
the opposite trend away from the apex approaching the
contact line. For D = 1.01 · 103 m, the free surface dim-
ples at the stagnation point and bulges nearer the contact

the nonwetting, may be increased by increasing either DT
or decreasing D. A silicone-oil droplet subjected to the
same conditions has a larger capillary number than that
of water. Therefore, a silicone oil drop more easily exhibits
deformation when D is small enough. Finally, it is observed
that wetting is enhanced rather than inhibited when a cold
drop is pressed against a hot plate, for gas is drained away
from the lubricating ﬁlm.

model. The influences of some of the process param-
eters, such as the exposure energy, the properties of
the photoresist, and the visibility of the interference
fringes on the structural dimensions, are studied.
The linewidth of the photoresist everywhere within
the exposure area is simulated by the enhancement
of the relative concentration of the photoactive com-
pound. The results are verified experimentally. How
the transmittance and variations in the structural
dimensions are affected by the changes in the prop-
erty of the photoresist as well as poor interferometric
fringe contrast within the exposure area are also an-
alyzed in detail.
2. Exposure Model for Interferometric Lithography
The factor of most concern in the exposure and devel-
opment model is the distribution of the photoactive
compound (PAC) inside the photoresist. According to
the Beer–Lambert law, the transmittance and absor-
bance of a substance can be combined together to ob-
tain the relationship between the light intensity and
the depth and concentration of the absorbent. This
phenomenon can be described as follows:
dI
dzIimi, (1)
where I represents the intensity of the exposure light,
i and mi represent the molar absorption coefficient
and the molar concentration of the ith component
within the substance, and z represents the depth be-
low the interface between the air and the photoresist.
For a positive photoresist, we needed to consider four
absorbing species: the inhibitor, the base resin, the
reaction products, and the solvent. Equation (1) can
be written as
Iz, t
z Iz, tPACmPACz, tBRmBRz, t
RPmRPz, tSmSz, t, (2)
where the subscripts PAC, BR, RP, and S represent
the photoactive compound, the base of the resin, the
reaction products, and the solvent, respectively. The
destruction of the inhibitor is

where C is the fractional decay rate of the inhibitor
per unit intensity. Using Eqs. (2) and (3), Dill et al.19
proposed an exposure model for the description of the
light absorbability of a positive photoresist and its
reaction for the duration of the exposure process:
Iz, t
z Iz, tAMz, tB, (4)

t Iz, tMz, tC, (5)

. (8)
A and B are called Dill’s parameters; they represent
the absorption of the photoresist, with and without
the reaction of light. The subscripts PAC0, BR0, and
S0 represent the initial conditions of PAC, BR, and S,
respectively.M represents the relative concentration
of the photoactive compound. From formulas (6) and
(7), it can be seen that parameters A and B are
strongly dependent on the species type and its con-
centration within the photoresist.
The above model has mostly been applied in the
process of photolithography. In previous exposure
model research, the light intensity has been con-
stant. This means that the light intensity, which
passes through the mask, is assumed to be uniform;
it then transforms the pattern to the photoresist.
However, the laser light source used in present in-
terferometric lithographic systems has a Gaussian
distribution. For a large beam size, we can express
the electric field of the laser as follows:
E x, y, zE0 exp r2w02expjk · rk, (9)
r 	x2 y2, (10)
where rk is the position vector that begins at some
arbitrary origin and ends at the point xk, yk, zk),|rk|
is the distance over which the wave is propagated, E0
is the amplitude at |rk|  0, w0 represents the beam
size at |rk|  0, r is the position within the beam, k
is the propagation vector of the wave, and w0 is the
radius of the beam (spot size). In interferometric li-
thography, the transverse electric (TE) mode is usu-
ally selected. According to the Fresnel equation, the
electric field of the transmitted wave can be obtained
from the incident wave multiplied by the amplitude
transmission coefficient t. Considering only the lin-
early polarized waves of this form, the interference of
two waves at the Ats surface can be described as

into two beams by a broadband, nonpolarizing cubic
beam splitter. The polarizer was used to ensure the
polarization direction of the two beams. To ensure
that the two beams were of equal intensity and equal
optical path length, we put an attenuator in one arm
and a compensator in the other so as to obtain the
best contrast of the fringes. Only the TE mode was
used in this study. After setting up this system, to
obtain the size of the laser beam for our simulation
model, we used a CCD to capture an image of the
laser beam. After obtaining the image pixel count, the
data were fitted to the Gaussian function as shown in
Fig. 3. By normalizing the count distribution in Fig.
3, we can obtain the position at the value of 1e2, then
multiply by the pixel size of the CCD to determine
the size of the beam w0  2 mm. The power of the
experimental beam was measured by a powermeter.
By matching the integration power of a simulated
beam of sizew0 with the experimental one, the central
maximum of the beam can be decided. The correspon-
dence of the simulated beam to the experimental one is
acquired. For sample preparation, we chose silicon as
the substrate. The substrate was coated with photore-
sist and then mounted on a rotational stage for expo-
sure. The samples were spin coated with Shipley
S1813 at the maximum spinning speed of 2500 rpm
and baked at 115 °C for 60 s to remove any solvent in
the photoresist. The thickness of the photoresist was
1.5 m after all these steps. By operating two ro-
tational mirrors, the two coherent beams were made
to form an interference pattern in the photoresist
with an interference angle i. After exposure, the
samples were developed in a MICROPOSIT MF-321
developer. The process uses diluted 4:1 de-ionized
water. Samples were then hard baked at 130 °C for
100 s. Finally, we obtained a periodic photoresist struc-
ture on the silicon substrate.
4. Analysis and Discussion
A. Effect of Neglecting the Deformation of the Beam
In previous interferometric or holographical litho-
graphic studies, the intensity distribution has usu-
ally been considered to be a constant cosine function.
The overall effects of the beam such as the Gaussian
intensity distribution and the beam deformation,
caused by the different incident angles, have always
been neglected. To remedy this, we simulate condi-
tions with and without deformation of the beam by
the incident angles, as shown in Fig. 4. An increase in
the incident angle implies more serious deformation
of the beam as can be seen in the figure. A comparison
of a deformation with a nondeformation case shows
that all the intensities without beam deformation will
be overestimated at the center and underestimated
near the edge. In view of the intensity being distrib-
uted as a Gaussian function, five points from the
center of the beam toward the outside (1 to 5), with
intervals of 0.5 mm, were taken sequentially to in-
vestigate the variation in the intensity of the entire
beam. The difference in intensity (F) between the two
cases, with and without considering beam deforma-
tion, can be defined as
F
Icircle Iellipsoid
Iellipsoid
, (21)
where Iellipsoid and Icircle are the intensities with and
without beam deformation. Figure 5 shows the frac-
tion of the difference in intensity at different posi-
tions as the incident angle rises from 15° to 60°.
The dashed line indicates Iellipsoid  Icircle, and the neg-
ative and positive F represent Iellipsoid  Icircle and
Iellipsoid  Icircle, respectively. It can be seen that when
the incident angle is 15°, the difference between the
two cases is quite small F  0.053 at the center;
F  0.358 at the edge (the intensity difference is
only 0.012 mWcm2) at intervals of 2 mm], but it
becomes larger as the incident angle increases. In
addition, taking an incident angle of 45° as an exam-
ple, two misjudgments occur in the region above and
below the dashed line. They cause insufficient and
overexposure doses at the center and the edge of the
beam, respectively, during the experiments. When the
incident angle increases to 60°, the intensity without
beam deformation is double that at the center of the
beam, which will lead to serious errors if applied in the
experiment. Based on the above results, the model
without beam deformation is only applicable when the
incident angle is less than 15°. The model with beam
deformation is applied for later discussions.
B. Controlling Linewidth by Varying the Exposure Time
Since there is no mask used in this system, the line-
width of the periodic structure has to be controlled via
the interference angle between two interfering beams
and by the exposure energy. The period of the line
pattern is determined by the selection of the in-
terference angle. The interference light intensity of
V  1 with a Gaussian distribution coupled with a
cosine function in space is shown in Fig. 1. The rela-
tive concentration of PAC (M) inside the period can be
controlled by the light intensity and the exposure
time. Table 1 shows the exposure parameters that
we used in the model. The simulation results are on
Fig. 3. Pixel count of the laser beam with the fitting curve.
10 November 2006  Vol. 45, No. 32  APPLIED OPTICS 8281
mensions of the two cases at the same depth of
z  1.5 m became smaller as the exposing time
increased. The variance in dimensions between 50
and 200 s was larger in the case of lower intensity
when the exposure time was increased.We also found
that in both of the two cases, the structure dimen-
sions decayed more rapidly at the beginning of expo-
sure and then the decay rate slowed down.
C. Transmittance and Structure Dimensions for Different
Positions within the Exposure Area
Dill et al.19 derived the following expression for the
transmittance (T) of the light through the photoresist:
Tt exp
o
d
AMz, tBdz, (23)
where d is the thickness of the photoresist. This
formula has been employed to calculate the trans-
mittance for the present case. Figure 8 shows the
transmittance of the photoresist at different positions
with a 1.5 m thickness and a 1.365 mWcm2 central
maximum exposure intensity of the Gaussian beam.
It is obvious that the reactive rate of light with the
photoresist is different at each position and that the
rate at positions 4 and 5 is much lower than at posi-
tions 1, 2, and 3. We can see that it took approxi-
mately 1000 s to attain the end of the reaction at
position 5, almost 800 s more than at position 1.
Figure 9 shows the structure dimensions at z  1.5
m. The incident angle is 30° for each position, and
exposure times differ from 60 to 90 s. The dashed line
represents the structure dimensions of an equal line
and space (LS) width. The structure dimensions be-
low the dashed line are far from the value of 221 nm
obtained for the higher exposure time. In addition,
the difference in the structure dimensions between
positions 3 and 1 show a decrease from 172 to 84 nm
when the exposure time was raised from 60 to 90 s.

the present results, it is obvious that the effect of A
on M is significant when B, C, I, z, and t are fixed.
Moreover, the effect of A affects the structure dimen-
sions by causing decay as the exposure time is in-
creased.
E. Effects of Decreasing Fringe Visibilities on the
Structural Variations
Figure 13 shows the intensity profile and the light
intensity at the peaks and valleys in a period with
different visibilities for different positions. From this
figure, we can see that as the visibility decreases, the
intensity at the peaks and valleys within the whole
exposure area would decrease and rise, respectively.
The intensity of the peaks and valleys would get
closer as the visibility decreases. Figure 14 shows the
intensity distribution with different visibilities with
i  30° at position 1. MS and M1.5 represent the
relative concentration of PAC on the surface and at
z 1.5 m. In this case, the positions that correspond
to M1.5  0.4 are x  110.5 and 331.5 nm, and the
structure dimension at z  1.5 m is 221 nm. From
Fig. 14, we see that the intensities at the two posi-
tions mentioned above are unaffected no matter what
the visibilities are. We find thatMS decreased from 1
to 0.31 with decreased visibility from 1 to 0.5 at the
low point of the valley. Consequently, the dissolution
rate at the surface forV 0.5 would be faster than for
the others under the same development process and
would result in a decaying aspect ratio of the periodic
structure after developing. Figure 15 shows the AFM
image of the periodic structure. We see that the
height of the structure is 80 nm; the width of the
structure is 400 nm after developing; the height of
the structure is much less than the thickness of the
coated photoresist 1.5 m. This structure had a low
aspect ratio of approximately 1:5 under exposure to
the light source; this might have been due to bad
visibility. Figure 16 shows variations in the structure
dimensions at z  1.5 m, which are caused by dif-
ferent visibilities at i  30°. It can be found that the
curves of the three cases intersect at one point and that

repulsion) [1]. This study focuses on permanent nonwetting caused by fluid-dynamic forces. In
the case of permanent noncoalescence (nonwetting), lubricating fluid does not drain away but
is continuously replenished by controlling either the temperature difference between the liquid
(liquid/solid) surfaces or the relative tangential speed between droplet and bath (solid surface). In
the first case, thermocapillary (or Marangoni) stress, which is induced by the temperature-induced
surface-tension gradient, continuously supplies refresh lubricant, separating the noncoalescing or
nonwetting surfaces. This phenomenon has been called ‘self-lubrication.’ In the second case, forced
relative tangential motion is used to supply the lubricating gas via the no-slip condition. It is this
second case, in particular applied to a nonwetting situation, which is the focus of the present work.
The observation of bouncing droplets by Rayleigh [2] was the first systematic investigation
of temporary noncoalescense. The phenomenon is due to competition between the time scales
associated with the draining of lubricating gas between the liquid surfaces and the restoring
surface-tension forces.
The first report of permanent, thermocapillary-induced noncoalescense was by Napolitano
et al. [3], in which they reported difficulty re-connecting two ends of a nonisothermal, liquid
bridge broken during a space experiment. Renewed interest in these subjects is due to experiments
performed by Dell’Aversana and co-workers [4, 5] that demonstrate permanent noncoalescense and
nonwetting. Some of this interest is due to the potential for applications of the phenomena in the
form of bearings and springs, or for the enhancement of droplet transport, in low-load environments.
Further examples and discussion are provided in the review by Neitzel and Dell’Aversana [1]. A pa-
per by Dell’Aversana and Neitzel [6] discusses both noncoalescing and nonwetting states, including
the possible failure of the lubricating film. Sumner et al. [7] treat a two-dimensional, thermocapil-
lary nonwetting case using lubrication theory and a recent paper by the present authors [8] explores
numerical solutions for this case.
Neitzel and Dell’Aversana [1] have presented preliminary results showing that a solid surface
with sufficient tangential velocity is capable of avoiding wetting by an approaching droplet at
the same temperature as the surface. The free surface of such an isothermal, nonwetting drop
exhibits a dimple, which deepens and widens with an increase of the load. Such droplets are
able to slide across the moving surface with minimal friction. Experiments provide a wealth of
information about such systems; however, design efforts would be enhanced by the availability of
a numerical model that can faithfully simulate such behaviour. The purpose of the present work
is to demonstrate a simulation capability for a two-dimensional, isothermal nonwetting droplet.
Simulations of a nonwetting droplet are complicated by the disparate length scales associated
with flows within the gas and liquid fields: typical droplet sizes in experiments are of O(mm)
while film thicknesses are O(m). Previous numerical simulations have treated the gas phase in an
ad hoc manner, such as those of Monti et al. [9, 10] in which the lubricating film is modelled as a
duct flow within an axisymmetric channel. A recent paper by Smith and Neitzel [11] has discussed
a multi-scale model of isothermal nonwetting with a hybrid approach employing lubrication theory
for the interstitial film and numerical simulation for the liquid and outer gas fields. In this approach,
the net flow rate in the channel must be specified as the known condition. As noted briefly above
numerical simulation of thermocapillary wetting suppression has been performed by the present
authors [8] using the commercial code FIDAP, which is also the approach taken for the present
work. In this paper, flows in the liquid and gas phases are computed simultaneously, adjusting
the interface position through the use of the stress boundary conditions imposed thereon. Their
results have shown that thermocapillary nonwetting can occur when either a silicone-oil or water
drop approaches a cold wall. The region of ‘apparent contact’ can be enlarged by either increasing

pinning of contact line to this edge is enhanced by applying a barrier-wetting agent to the entire
disk. We have selected a channel domain for simplicity, choosing to focus on the effect of the
lubrication region and free-surface deformation. Therefore, to simulate the disk geometry of the
experiments, the contact lines in the present calculations are assumed to be pinned at x =±R on
the lower surface. The drop sizes considered in the present computations are O(mm), so the liquid
volume is small and the Bond number Bo = lgR2/l is less than unity, where l, l, R are the
density, surface tension, and radius of droplet, respectively, and g is the gravitational acceleration.
Hence, gravity may be safely neglected in these computations.
The governing equations for this model are the continuity, and Navier–Stokes equations:
∇ · Vi = 0 (1)
i [(Vi · ∇)]Vi = −∇Pi + i∇2Vi (2)
where Vi = ui i+vi j is the velocity vector, Pi is the pressure, i is the density, and i is the dynamic
viscosity. The subscript ‘i’ = ‘l’ denotes the liquid phase (‘l’ = ‘s’ if the liquid is silicone-oil; ‘l’ = ‘w’
if the liquid is water) and ‘i’ = ‘a’ represents a air.
The gas–liquid interface described by y = S(x) satisfies the kinematic, stress continuity, and
no-slip conditions at the interface:
Vl · ∇S = Va · ∇S (3)
rl − ra = 2l H − ∇l (4)
Vl = Va (5)
where H is the mean curvature of the surface, ri is the stress vector, and the surface tension of a
particular liquid is l. The boundary conditions on the solid surfaces are the kinematic and no-slip
conditions, and both the stress in x-direction and the y-component of velocity are constrained to
be zero as the boundary conditions of the entrance and exit:

ui = vi = 0 for y = 0 and −∞x∞ (7)

The drop is assumed to be pinned to the fixed wall at x =±R, i.e. the contact line is fixed, requiring

uncoupled (i.e. segregated solver) method employed in the commercial code FIDAP. Each degree
of freedom is solved separately. The normal-stress balance condition is utilized to update the
position of the free surface for each iteration. The solution obtained is checked for velocity
convergence within a preset tolerance (less than 10−6) being satisfied, based on the criterion of
solution-vector relative error. A discontinuous pressure approximation combined with a mixed
method is used and upwinding is employed to prevent wiggles. Spatial instability appears as
node-to-node overshoots or undershoots in the solution variables. The complex geometries of
the physical domain (Figure 1) are handled with unstructured quadrilateral simplex elements. To
address the difficulty of disparate length scales associated with droplet and interstitial film, an
appropriate finer mesh is applied near the free surface in both liquid and gas fields; the nodes
on the free surface are permitted to move in the direction of the local normal. The mesh plot
is illustrated in Figure 2. Test computations of mesh convergence were performed by increasing
the element number on all domains and boundaries, until the quantitative variations, i.e. the
maximum and minimum velocity, pressure, and radius on the droplet free surface, were less
than 0.5%, which was regarded as an acceptable accuracy. For different sets of finite elements,
the results showed that the use of 3310 elements yields both acceptable accuracy and compu-
tation time.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In the present simulation, the liquid inside a semicircular drop with R = 1 mm is selected to be either
5 cSt silicone-oil or water; their physical properties are listed in Table I. Isothermal noncoalescence
[4] and nonwetting [6] experiments evaluated the phenomena with surfaces moving from 350 to
450 mm/s and showed lateral vertex displacements for millimeter-sized droplets of hundreds of
microns for squeezing on the order of 10m. Therefore, the wall speeds, V = 300, 400, and
500 mm/s, as well as the distances between two walls, D = 1.01, 1.03, and 1.05 mm, are chosen
in this study.
Figure 3 displays the streamlines and velocity vectors for silicone-oil, with V = 300 mm/s and
D = 1.01 mm. In what follows, the direction of wall motion will be referred to as the ‘down-
stream’ direction. The air close to the moving wall flows downstream, induced by viscous forces.
Part of the gas passes through the gap between the wall and droplet, while the rest impinges
on the droplet surface, flowing along it toward the support, finally moving upstream due to a
pressure gradient established by the blocking of the flow by the droplet. Therefore, the veloc-
ity vectors at the entrance (Figure 3(b)) to the computational domain exhibit a two-dimensional
Couette–Poiseuille-type profile. In the lubricating film, the gas velocity decreases from the moving-
wall velocity to the droplet velocity at the interface (Figure 3(c)). After the air passes through
the thinnest portion of the film, it decelerates due to the widening gap. Interestingly, the air
flow in the downstream portion of the geometry exhibits a similar behaviour to that on the

There are three vortices inside the droplet, as indicated by the streamlines of Figure 3(e). The
major vortex appears in the droplet centre, and the other two vortices are located at the upstream
and downstream sides of the droplet. The strength of the upstream side corner vortex is stronger
than that on the downstream side, and these two corner vortices rotate in a direction opposite to
that of the major, central one. The counter-clockwise flow motion of the major vortex is induced
by the increased air velocity within the interstitial film. The streamlines for the flow field from

q = 2.491 mm2/s are similar to those seen in Figure 3(e).
Figure 4 exhibits the resultant speed (Vs =
√
u2 + v2), and pressure-difference (P = Pa − Pl)
distribution on the silicone-oil drop’s free surface, when the wall’s distance is fixed (D = 1.01 mm)
and the moving-wall velocity is varied (V = 300, 400, and 500 mm/s). The positive value of
resultant velocity is defined for the counter-clockwise flow motion along the free surface, and
the negative one for the clockwise flow motion. The speed distribution (Figure 4(a)) shows two
stagnation points (Vs = 0) located near x = 0.35 mm and x =−0.6 mm when V = 300 mm/s, while
those of Smith and Neitzel [11] are located at x =−0.4 mm and x = 0.75 mm. In this case, the
maximum speed is Vs = 11.61 mm/s located at x =−0.06 mm, while Smith and Neitzel [11] show
Vs = 12.57 mm/s at x =−0.069 mm, an 8.3% resultant velocity difference. These results indicate
that those from the two models agree quite well.
The pressure-difference distribution on the free surface (Figure 4(b)) shows two local maxima
located near x = 0.2 mm and −0.15 mm, but these are not stagnation points. The positions of these
local maxima move slightly downstream as V increases. The upstream local maximum increases
with V due to the effect of faster-moving air impinging on the free surface. The pressure difference
exhibits a local minimum between x = 0.2 mm and x =−0.15 mm, due to the increased speed
within the film at the point of minimum thickness (Figure 4(a)) and then increases to the second
local maximum. Also observed in Figure 4(b) are the upstream and downstream negative pressure
gradients that drive the flows in the upstream direction along the stationary wall.
Figure 5 presents results of calculations performed for water under the same conditions of dis-
placement and wall speed used for the silicone-oil computations of Figure 4. The trend for water
drops is similar to that for silicone-oil drops. The Reynolds number is defined as Rel = lV R/l,
and is a measure of inertial force to viscous force. At V = 300 mm/s, the Reynolds number of
a water droplet (Rew = 298.8) is much larger than that of a corresponding silicone- oil droplet
(Res = 60). Hence, the free-surface velocity of water (Figure 5a) is much larger than the corre-
sponding one for silicone-oil (Figure 4(a)). In turn, this makes the pressure difference for water
(Figure 5(b)) greater than that for silicone-oil (Figure 4(b)).
The effect of distance between the droplet and moving wall has also been examined. Figure
6 displays the influence of distance (D = 1.01, 1.03, and 1.05 mm) for silicone-oil droplets when
the moving-wall velocity is constant (V = 300 mm/s). The free-surface velocity plot (Figure 6(a))
shows, not surprisingly, that the maximum velocity increases with decreasing film thickness (smaller
D). The pressure difference is also affected by the variation of the wall distance, as shown in Figure
6(b). The air driven by the wall motion impinges on the upstream side of the droplet. On the other
hand, the air impingement on the downstream side is induced by the recirculating flow, owing
to the requirement of mass conservation. It is obvious that both impinging effects increase as D
decreases. Therefore, as D is reduced, the local maxima of the pressure values increase. When
D = 1.01 mm, the impingement on the upstream side of the droplet is greater than that on the
downstream side. For larger gaps, this trend is reversed. The higher local maximum pressure
difference for D = 1.01 mm occurs at the upstream side, while that for D = 1.03 and 1.05 mm

for D = 1.01 mm. The free surface dimples on the upstream side and bulges on the downstream
side; in addition, the deformation is amplified as the wall speed increases. Figure 8(b) shows the
net normal stress n acting on the silicone-oil free surface as a function of x. The maximum net
normal stress occurs at roughly x = 0.2 mm, and then decreases rapidly to a minimum value at
about x =−0.2 mm; this means that the upstream side endures more net normal stress than the
downstream side. Additionally, the drop’s volume must be conserved, requiring that the upstream
side be concave and the downstream side convex. Moreover, increasing moving-wall velocity
increases the net normal stress over the droplet surface. This is especially apparent at the upstream
side. Equation (4) shows that the mean curvature is proportional to the net normal stress. This
explains why at the upstream side, the smaller radius (Figure 8(a)) (i.e. larger curvature) corresponds

V = 300 mm/s and three different D.
The influence of squeezing (i.e. varying D) on radius, normal stress and tangential stress
is illustrated in Figure 10 for a silicone-oil droplet and fixed wall speed of V = 300 mm/s.
The amount of deformation clearly increases with increased squeezing. Whereas the results of
Figure 8(b) show an increase in the local normal stress for all values of x with increasing wall
speed V, the results in Figure 10(b) indicate a deepening of the minimum ‘well’ in normal stress
near x =−0.2 mm with increased squeezing. Trends in the shear stress are similar to those exhibited
for increasing V.
Figure 11 displays the free-surface distributions of the water’s radius, the net normal stress, and
the net tangential stress, for the same conditions as presented for silicone-oil in Figure 10. The
trends for water are similar to those for silicone-oil.

For V = 500 mm/s with D = 1.01 mm, the Weber number of water is W ew = 3.43, much less than
that of silicone-oil (W es = 11.85), due to water’s large surface tension. Therefore, the deforma-
tion of the water droplet from its undeformed position is small in comparison with that observed
for silicone-oil. Consequently, the nonwetting effect is likely easier to observe for silicone-oil
droplets due to their greater deformability. This is further illustrated in Figure 13, which shows
the effect of wall speed (Figure 13(a)) and squeezing (Figure 13(b)) on the height of the sur-
face at x = 0. Increased squeezing and wall speed more profoundly impact S(0) for silicone-oil
than water.

An interferometric lithographic technique and double exposure method are applied to theoretically and
experimentally investigate several kinds of 2D periodic structures. The shape, lattice symmetries, and
lattice constants of the 2D structures, for different substrate rotational angles, are obtained from the
simulated predictions. The shape of the 2D structures can be varied by controlling the rotational angle
of the substrate and the development process, and they are validated experimentally. The variation of the
lattice symmetry of the 2D structure with the substrate rotational angle is discussed in detail in relation
to the axial angle and lattice constant. It is found that square, circular, rectangular, and elliptical
scatterers which are arranged in parallelogram, triangular, and square lattices (with different lattice
constants) can be obtained. The photonic bandgaps for each condition are also investigated. When the
substrate rotational angles are the same, the normalized frequency a2c of photonic bandgap
structures with an equal ﬁlling factor are very similar regardless of the interference angle. The results
are helpful in designing the forbidden frequency when the lattice constant and the scatterer shape can
be controlled by the interferometric lithographic technique. © 2007 Optical Society of America

1. Introduction
Interferometric lithography is one of the most impor-
tant and widely studied types of lithographic system
being developed today; it is suited for the construc-
tion of 1D, 2D, and 3D periodic structures of different
dimensions and with a large area [1–3]. These peri-
odic structures can be applied not only to the fabri-
cation of photonic crystals (PCs), waveguides, and
cavity resonators [4–6] but can also be used to en-
hance the hydrophobic behavior of nonwetting sur-
faces [7,8]. It is well known that the photonic
bandgap (PBG) is the major feature requiring atten-
tion in the application of the PCs. The propagation of
electromagnetic waves of certain frequencies within
the PBG is prohibited, regardless of their polarization
and propagation direction. However, the PC [9,10]
simulation results show that the PBG is strongly
affected by the lattice symmetry as well as the shape,
orientation, and size of the scatterers. Although elec-
tron beam lithography [11,12] because of its high
resolution and ﬂexibility in constructing arbitrary
patterns is largely employed to fabricate PBG struc-
tures, it requires expensive equipment and is time
consuming. The interferometric lithographic system
because of its repeatability, rapidity, and high reso-
lution, is acknowledged to be a powerful tool for fab-
ricating PBG structures. With this system and
utilizing the double exposure method [2,3], 2D inten-
sity patterns are obtained by superposing a pair of 1D
interference fringes. The included angles between
each 1D interference fringe are selected to obtain
different kinds of 2D intensity pattern. From their
results, we can conjecture that the geometry, lattice
symmetry, and lattice constant of the scatterers can
be easily controlled by altering the interference angle
and substrate rotational angle. However, in most
past studies the concern has been how to employ this
technique to fabricate triangular and square lattices
with air holes in a dielectric material [13], triangular
lattices with circular or elliptical air holes [14], or to

4. Results and Discussions
In the simulation an isointensity surface is ﬁrst de-
veloped by superposing a pair of 1D interference
fringes of the same intensity but different rotational
angles of 1  0° and 2  15°, 50°, and 90°, respec-
tively, as depicted in Fig. 2. The higher intensity
areas (red regions) represent the parts that experi-
ence greater exposure energy, while the lower inten-
sity parts (blue regions) experience less exposure
energy. When positive photoresist is used for expo-
sure, the photoresist in the lower intensity parts will
be retained (photoresist structure) after the develop-
ment process. It can easily be seen that the arrays
gradually become smaller, and their shape varies
from longer to shorter rectangles and ﬁnally to
squares as the rotational angle of the substrate in-
creases from 15° to 90°. In Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) it can be
clearly seen that the cross sections of the isointensity
surface are rectangles then evolve to ellipses in
shape. Similarly, in Fig. 2(c), the isointensity surfaces
are squares and then evolve to circles in shape. This
implies that when we fabricate PBG structures, the
shapes of the scatterers can easily be varied by alter-
ing the exposure conditions and the development pro-
cess.
Structures corresponding to the simulation results
are now constructed experimentally. Figure 3 shows
scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images of 2D
periodic structures with different rotational angles
taken after the second exposure step. The average
exposure energy of a single beam is approximately
100 mJcm2. The interference angles, as shown in
Figs. 3(a), 3(b), and 3(c), are nearly 10°. The pits
(darker parts) in Figs. 3(a), 3(b), and 3(c) are larger
than the structures that should be retained after
development (lighter parts). This phenomenon is
caused by overdevelopment. When the rotation angle
of 2 increases to 15°, 50°, and 90°, the respective
aspect ratio becomes approximately 8.17 and 3.67
and ﬁnally 1. The arrangement of the pits and islands

toresist solubility rates and the exposure energy for
different developer’s concentrations. They also dis-
cussed the nonlinearity of the photoresist response.
The relation included the overall response during the
experimental procedures, such as the development
concentration, temperature, prebake conditions, and
nonlinearities introduced by the development process
that should be obtained before carrying on the devel-
opment process. It is also the case that structures with
thin corners are unsuitable for pattern transference
using wet etching. Instead, a high selectivity ion cou-
pled plasma dry etching system should be used for
pattern transforming. Keeping the entire process sta-
ble so as to minimize the process errors is the most
important thing. When the aforementioned issues are
overcome and the whole process handled stably, it
should be possible to construct 2D structures of spec-
iﬁed dimensions by controlling the development pro-
cess.
In addition, the scatterers of photonic bandgap
structures can be either dielectric rods in air or air
rods in dielectric media. The aforementioned expo-
sure conditions are suited only to construct rods in
air. By decreasing the exposure dose, we can obtain
air rods in the photoresist, as shown in Fig. 5.
The period is one of the factors of most concern in
periodic structures. The period of 1D interference
fringes can be easily obtained via Eq. (5), but the
period of 2D periodic structures is difﬁcult to de-
scribe, especially when the periodic structures are
distorted asymmetrically with the substrate rota-
tional angles. Therefore we classify the period in two
speciﬁc directions, as shown in Fig. 2(b). For conve-
nience, the period in the x direction is called the long
side and that in the y direction the short side. The
periods along the two directions of the 2D structure
are inﬂuenced by the interference angle and the dif-
ference between the substrate rotational angles of
each step   
2  1

inﬂuence of the interference angles on the period of
the 2D structure we deﬁne the normalized period

ogram and triangular lattices, and square and circu-
lar for square lattice. The plane wave expansion
method is used to analyze the PBG of our structure by
solving Maxwell’s equations. The refractive indices of
the dielectric media and air are 3.48 (silicon) and 1,
respectively. The lattice constants for each lattice are
denoted as a and b and are shown in Fig. 7. They can
be calculated via Eqs. (13)–(15); detailed values are
given in Table 2. Here we choose 0.4 times the long
and short side period as the length and width of the
rectangular scatterers. Similarly, we select 0.125
times the long and short side period as the major
and minor axes of the elliptic scatterers. The dielec-
tric rods in air with different shapes are analyzed
for each type of lattice.
The results for a parallelogram lattice with an in-
terference angle of 30° are presented ﬁrst. The gap–
midgap ratio [26] R  g (where g is the
frequency at the middle of the gap, and  is the
frequency width of the gap) and the ﬁlling factor f
for different rotation angles are discussed. When
  60°, the PBG structure consisting of rectangu-
lar rods arranged in a triangular lattice with f 
0.319 is examined. The frequency at the middle of the
gap is g  0.255, and the frequency width is 
 0.06 and results in the largest gap–midgap ratio of
R  23.5%. The full-zone band structure is shown in
Fig. 9(a), and the bandgap is indicated by the oblique
lined area. By increasing the development time,
an elliptic PBG rod structure is obtained with f
 0.024 and R  22.7%. When   50°, f 
0.024 and 0.318 for elliptic and rectangular rods,
their gap–midgap ratios are 10.5% and 10.1%, respec-
tively, which is approximately one half of that of the
60° case. However, when   15° the scatterers are
elliptical in shape, and there is no gap in this kind of
PBG structure. The rotational angles of   15°,
50°, and 60° are considered here. Regardless of the
shape of the scatterers, the largest PBG appears in
the triangular lattice, i.e.,   60°. Next, a paral-
lelogram lattice with an interference angle of 10° is
considered. The substrate rotation angles  15°, 50°,
and 60° and PBG structures with two shapes are also
investigated. When   60°, the PBG structure
consisting of rectangular rods arranged in a triangu-
lar lattice with f  0.318 is examined. The frequency
at the middle of the gap is g  0.255, and the fre-
quency width is   0.06, while the largest gap–
midgap ratio is R  23.5%. The full zone of the band
structure is shown in Fig. 9(b) and the bandgap is
indicated by the oblique lined area. The results are
almost the same as in cases where the interference
angle is 30°. When there are two different interfer-
ence angles, 10° and 30°, at  60° different lattice
constants will be obtained; i.e., 0.512 m for 30° and

1. Introduction 
Today, the multicrystalline silicon (mc-si) solar cell has the world’s highest market share.  It is 
well know that the efficiency of a mc-si solar cell is strongly dependent on the quality of mc-si wafers, 
cut from massive mc-si ingots.  The quality of the as-grown ingots is affected by the impurity content 
and concentration from the feedstock and the dissolution of crucible and heating apparatuses during 
growth [1, 2].  One of the major impurities in silicon feedstock is carbon.  Pizzine et al.[3] showed 
that the density and electrical activity of dislocation in the mc-si ingot is strongly dependent on the 
carbon concentration [4].  The carbon concentration in the silicon crystal is lower than the one in the 
silicon melt since the segregation coefficient of carbon is smaller than the unity coefficient [4, 5].  
Silicon carbide (SiC) particles will  precipitate as the carbon concentration rises beyond the solubility 
limit in the silicon melt [4].  Therefore, the carbon content in the silicon feedstock must be kept as 
low as possible.   
Directional solidification (DS) is the common method for producing the mc-si ingots in the PV 
industrial.  Today, mc-si ingots with a weight of 240 kg are the ordinary size in ingot companies.  
Due to the large dimensions of the crucible in the DS furnace, the melt convection generated by the 
radial temperature gradients forms two coupled vortices in the melt [1, 6, 7].  Since the diffusion 
coefficient of impurities in the si melt is usually very small, the influence of melt convection on the 
impurity distribution may be significant during directional solidification of m-si ingot [8].  Muhlbauer 
et al. [9] found that the incorporation of the SiC particles into the growing crystal was prevented by the 
convectional melt flow.  Liu et al. [4] have investigated the carbon concentration and SiC 
precipitation during a mc-si directional solidification process.  Their results indicated that the 
impurities can be controlled by the cooling rate.  The grain distribution of as-grown ingots can be 
controlled by the modification of the furnace configuration due to the change of the evolution history 
of the crystalline front shape [10].  Since the flow convection inside the melt is different for unique 
crystalline front shapes, we can expect that the carbon distribution in the ingot will be different for 
unique crystalline front histories.   
In this study, a series of numerical simulations have been performed to investigate how the 
convection pattern of the melt affects the carbon concentration distribution during the growth process 
of a GT-DSS240 furnace.  The carbon distribution in the ingots grown from the GT-DSS240 furnace 
by Sino-American Silicon Products Inc. (SAS) was measured and was compared with the numerical 
one. 
 
2. Mathematical model  
A schematic representation of the industrial DSS furnace is shown in figure 1.  The temperature 
of the furnace wall is kept at a constant temperature by a cooling system, and the side insulation moves 
upward during ingot growth.  The mc-si ingot grows from the bottom to the top of the crucible by 
heat dissipating from the bottom of the crucible to the furnace wall.   
In the numerical simulation, an axis-symmetric furnace is assumed.  The melt is assumed to be a 
Newtonian fluid, and the deformation of the free surface is neglected.   The buoyancy convection 
may be generated by the temperature and concentration gradients in the melt.  The Lewis number Le, 
which is defined as the ratio of the thermal diffusivity 　 to the mass diffusivity D, represents the 
relative strength of the buoyancy force induced by the non-uniform temperature to that generated by 
the non-uniform concentration.  The Lewis number Le is about 1000 for the carbon concentration in 
the silicon melt.  Therefore, the buoyancy due to the non-uniform concentration is neglected in the 
present study.  The material properties of silicon are shown in table 1 [2, 8, 11, 12].   
The governing differential equations of heat and mass transports are listed as below:

The temperature at the melt/crystal interface is equal to the melting temperature of silicon, and the

where un is the local crystalline rate normal to the melt-crystal interface and H is the latent heat. 
 The zero carbon mass flux is specified at crucible walls and gas-melt interfaces, and the segregation 
effect is taken into account for carbon impurity.  The segregation phenomenon at a melt/crystal 
interface is described by 
slok  ,                                                         (15)

Carbon concentration flux on the crucible walls is set to zero.  The segregation coefficient of carbon 
ok  is selected to be 0.07 [4].   
The energy, continuity, momentum and species equations with proper initial and boundary conditions 
are solved by the CGSim package which is based on the Finite Volume Method (FVM).  Both the 
global and local simulations are carried out in this study.  The global simulation is mainly used to 
compute the heat transfer by radiation between the different surfaces of the furnace; the incoming 
radiative heat flux along all boundaries in the global model is used for local model.  The local model 
reads these heat fluxes and corrects them to get the exact crystalline rate specified in the same 
operation condition of the grown ingot and to predict the crystalline front shape.  Moreover, the local 
simulation results are mainly used to analyze the convection patterns of the melt and the carbon 
concentration distribution.   
 
3. Results and discussion  
The unsteady numerical simulation for a growing process of a mc-si ingot with 69 cm width and 24.5 
cm height in the standard GT-DSS240 furnace was carried out.  Based on the carbon concentration of 
the feedstock used by the Sino-American Silicon Products Inc. (SAS), the initial carbon concentration 
0 was selected to be 24 ppma.  The instant melt flow, temperature, and carbon concentration 
distributions for different solidification fractions are shown in Fig. 3-7.  According to the hot zone 
characteristic of the standard DSS furnace, the heat is mainly conducted into the melt by the upper 
crucible side wall and is radiated to the free surface of the melt from the components of furnace, while 
the heat is conducted outward by the lower part of crucible side wall and the bottom of the crucible.  
The latent heat is released into the melt at the melt/crystal interface.  Therefore, the maximum 
temperature of the melt appears at the tri-junction point of solid-melt-gas phases.  For the case of 6% 
solidification fraction, the temperature near the crucible side wall is higher than that near the center 
region at the same horizontal level in the upper part of the melt region, while it is lower for the melt 
region near the crystalline front (Fig. 3a).  The Grashof number Gr reflects the strength of the 
buoyancy convection, and the Marangoni number Ma denotes the magnitude of thermocapillary 
convection.  The order of Gr (107 ~ 108) is much larger than that of Ma (102 ~ 103); it means that the 
 10  
than 62%, as opposed to separation at 68% solidification fraction for the standard case.  The upper 
vortex of the modified case is stronger than that of the standard case.  The carbon concentration 
gradients in the melt for the modified case are less than those of the standard one.  Hence, for the 
modified case, the convection effect of the lower vortex on the carbon concentration is less significant, 
which may be beneficial to the transverse homogeneity in carbon distribution.  When the 
solidification fraction is less than 62%, the maximum carbon concentration in the melt appears at the 
center.  For higher solidification fractions, it occurs near the crucible wall.  The rectangular mc-si 
ingot with 69 cm width and 24.5 cm height was grown by the standard and modified GT-DSS240 
furnace (from Sino-American Silicon products Inc. (SAS)).  The carbon concentration of the grown 
ingots was measured and compared with that of the simulations.  It was averaged from R = 0 to 
172.55 mm for different axial position.  The computational results of both standard and modified 
cases are in good agreement with the experimental ones (Fig. 13a and 13b).  Figure 13c shows that 
the average carbon concentration in the ingot from R = 0 to 172.55 mm of the modified case for 
different axial positions is smaller than that of the standard one,  It is clear that the transverse 
homogeneity in carbon concentration in the modified case is more uniform than in the standard one.     
 
4. Conclusion 
The simulation of carbon concentration distribution in the melt for the industrial DSS furnace 
during the growth process has been carried out.  The melt convection is induced by buoyancy and 
thermocapillary for the DSS furnace, and the vortex pattern of melt convection changes during the 
growth process.  As the solidification fraction is small, the flow pattern of melt convection mainly 
consists of upper and lower vortices in the melt that couple each other.  The intensity of the lower 
vortex is higher than that of the upper one.  The bell shape of the carbon concentration isolines are 
generated by the two coupled vortices’ motion, at which point higher carbon concentration appears 
near the central region of the melt.  For higher solidification fraction, the upper vortex has been 
moved gradually towards the corner region of the crucible side wall and the lower vortex separate to 
two vortices whose motion induces the higher carbon concentration to move from near the central 
region of the melt towards the side wall of the crucible. 
The strength of the lower vortex is strong at a smaller solidification fraction; it is harmful to the 
homogeneity of carbon concentration distribution.  The large concavity of the central region of 
crystalline front increases the strength of the lower vortex.  The furnace structure modified by Teng et 
al. [10], which can obtain the higher convexity in the central region of the crystalline front during the 
growth, was also simulated in this study.  For this modified furnace, the strength of the lower vortex 
is weaker in comparison with the standard one.  The distribution of carbon impurities is more 
uniform.

where T = TH - 　T × x with T = TH at x = 0 and T = Tc at x = 
L.   The microdroplet is released from the initial position of 
x = 2.5mm.  This distance is far enough that the motion 
behavior is not affected by the walls [15].  The position of 
the gas-liquid interface is described by z = S(x).   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All the physical properties are assumed to be independent of 
the temperature except the surface tension.  
Various computational techniques [16-20] have been 
developed to calculate the moving and deforming interface.  
A conservative level set method has recently been used in 
which the motion of gas/liquid interface can be captured while 
conserving the microdroplet mass during the motion process 
[21].  This method has been performed to predict the falling 
of a microdroplet in air [21], to trace the movement of the 
interface in two-phase flows [22], and to capture the contact 
line dynamics between the interface of two immiscible fluids 
and the solid surface [23].  Therefore, the conservative level 
set method is chosen for this study.  
The entire domain Ω is separated by the air subdomain Ω1 
and the silicon oil subdomain Ω2.  Let the S(x) be the internal 
boundary between Ω1 and Ω2 (Fig.1).  Following Olsson and 
Kreiss [21], the level set function Φ is used, which goes 
smoothly from 0 to 1.  The air/microdroplet interface is

The force of singularity appears at the contact line or the 
contact point [25, 26] when the microdroplet moves.  It can 
be alleviated by permitting slip in the neighborhood of the 
contact line [25-28]. Following Spelt [27], the solid/liquid 
boundary condition is imposed by the Navier slip condition

temperature moves towards the advancing edge as the time 
increases. From Fig. 6, we can see that the vortex in the 
receding region increases. It is clear that in this period the 
momentum of the vortex at the receding side increases while 
that in the advancing side decreases.  As a result, the net 
momentum inside the droplet increases and the microdroplet 
accelerates quickly (Fig. 2(b)).  When t > 0.6 sec, this shifts 
in position slowly back, close to the mid-plane of the droplet.  
The vortex in the receding region decreases.  Consequently, 
the net momentum inside the microdroplet decreases (Fig. 6) 
and its speed is reduced too (Fig. 2 (b)).  The stagnation point 
seems to remain in the same position when t > 2.81 sec.  The 
size of the vortices does not change significantly with time.  
As a result, the net momentum does not seem to change and 
the droplet reaches a quasi-steady speed.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
In this study, the transient migration behavior of a liquid 
microdroplet, with large static contact angle and high aspect 
ratio of height profile and footprint radius induced by 
temperature gradients, is investigated numerically. Two 
vortices are generated inside the microdroplet.  The vortex is 
always larger in size on the receding side than the advancing 
one.  The net momentum in the x direction pushes the droplet 
to move from the hot side to the cold one.  The variation of 
the vortex size causes the speed of the microdroplet to
