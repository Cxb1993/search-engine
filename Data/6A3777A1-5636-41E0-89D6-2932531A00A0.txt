Abstract
In this report, nonlinear theory for a circular
plate including the effect of transverse shearing is
discussed. The strains of three dimensional
nonlinear elasticity are determined for a
delaminated circular plate. The displacements are
in terms of the coordinate normal to the
mid-surface of the plate. Using the virtual work
principle, the nonlinear equations of equilibrium
and the variational boundary conditions are
obtained. Typical mechanical loading to the plates
will be discussed. The numerical results are
obtained by using the generalized differential
quadrature (GDQ) method.
Keywords: circular plate, virtual work, nonlinear
elasticity, numerical solution.
二、緣由與目的
The classical linear theory of plates based on
Kirchhoff's elastic strain- displacement relations
has been extensively studied in literature. Such a
theory neglects completely the effects of
transverse shear forces and so gives rise to a few
mathematical discrepancies and is inaccurate for a
moderately thick laminated plate with relatively
soft transverse shear modulus and for highly
anisotropic composites. The inaccuracy is due to
neglecting the effects of transverse shear and
normal strains in the laminate. It is well known
that the effect of transverse shear can be
significant when the cross-sectional dimensions of
a beam are large in comparison to its length; the
effect of rotatory inertia for higher modes is
important as well. Transverse stresses are
generally small compared to the largest in-plane
stress, however, they can be important when the
structure is relatively weak in the transverse
direction and when the structural response is
sensitive to the transverse stiffness. In order to
take into account the effects of low ratio of
transverse shear modulus to the in-plane modulus,
a number of first-order shear deformation theories
have been developed. It has been shown that the
classical and first-order shear deformation theories
are inadequate to predict the accurate solutions of
laminated composite plates; see articles by
Whitney and Sun [1], Reissner [2], Reddy [3] and
Stein[4].
In this thesis, we used the generalized
differential quadrature (GDQ) method to obtain
the numerical results. The differential quadrature
method was introduced by Bellman and Casti [5]
in 1971. Bert, Jang and Striz [6] first used the
differential quadrature method to solve
engineering problems for analyzing free vibration
of structural components. Shu and Du [7] used the
generalized differential quadrature (GDQ) method
as a new methodology for implementing the
clamped and simply supported boundary
conditions for the free vibration analysis of beams

The GDQ method and numerical results
Basically, the GDQ method can be stated that: the
derivative of a smooth function at a discrete point
in a domain can be discretized by using an
approximated weighting linear sum of the function
values at all the discrete points in the direction.
For the first-order derivatives, they can be
discretized by:

In this May, I attend the Ninth CANMET/ACI International Conference
on Fly Ash, Silica Fume, Slag and Natural Pozzolans in Concrete in
Whasa, Poland, May 20 to 25, 2007. I published a paper entitled “Pore
Structure and Strength Prediction of Fly Ash Concrete”. This research
aims to investigate the pore structures of fly ash concrete and the relation
between porosity and compressive strength, and accordingly to establish a
strength prediction model. This international conference was supported by
CANMET Mineral Technology Branch, CMTB, CANMET Energy
Technology Centre, and CETC American Concrete Institute (ACI). ACI is
founded in 1904, and is famous in the world. ACI has two Journals: ACI
Structural Journal and ACI Materials Journal. This is a joint international
conference of CANMET and ACI, and hold every three years.

INTRODUCTION
Compressive strength has been always regarded as an important index of concrete
quality. To ensure the construction safety and economy in engineering practice, one needs
to know the strength development of concrete at early ages. Hence, the strength
prediction of concrete is necessary. The pozzolanic materials have been used widely in
concrete construction because of many advantages (1, 2), such as less cost, decrease of
heat of hydration, and improvement of water tightness. The effects of pozzolans on the
properties of concrete will differ greatly depending on the kind of pozzolanic material, its
quality, its percentage replacement of cement and the curing methods. Prediction of the
strength of concrete containing pozzolanic materials is much more complicated, and the
current strength prediction equations can not provide accurate results. In addition to
water-to-binder ratio and capillary porosity, this research also considers the substitute
ratio of the pozzolanic materials as a parameter to investigate the relations of each
parameter and the strength of concrete, and accordingly to establish the strength
prediction equation for pozzolanic concrete.
EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM
Materials
ASTM Type Ⅰ portland cement and ASTM class F fly ash are used, the
maximum size of coarse aggregate is 20 mm, the fineness modulus of fine aggregate is
2.97, and the superplasticizer of HICON HPC1000 which meets the requirements of
ASTM C494 G-Type is used. The chemical and physical properties of cement and fly ash
are listed in Table 1 and Table 2.
Substitute Ratios of Fly Ash and Compressive Strength
It can be seen clearly from Table 4 that the substitute ratios of fly ash directly
affects the strength development of concrete. The bigger the substitute ratio of fly ash is,
the less the product of cement hydration will be at an early age, and cause a lower
strength. Considering the ages of concrete under 7days, the strength decreases apparently
with the increase of substitution ratio of fly ash. At 28 days, the strength of fly ash
concretes approaches to that of plain concrete, implying that the pozzolanic reaction of
fly ash results in strength enhancement. After 56 days, the strength of fly ash concrete is
almost equal to that of the plain concrete, except the one with 30% replacement and those
with lower W/B are even higher. These results reveal that adding fly ash in concrete is
advantageous to the strength, but the substitution ratio should be under 30%.
Pore Structure and Compressive Strength
Figure 6 illustrates the regression curve of strength versus total pore volume. The
derived equation is: S=73.12 -907.61Vt +2931.65Vt2; R2=0.940, where S=compressive
strength (MPa) and Vt=total pore volume (c.c/g). Figure 7 shows the regression curve of
strength versus capillary pore volume. The derived equation is: S=71.79
-982.32Vc+3562.48Vc2; R2=0.954, where S=compressive strength (MPa) and
Vc=capillary pore volume (c.c/g). Comparing the results of the two relation curves, the
capillary pore volume has the closest correlation with the strength of fly ash concrete
with a correlation coefficient up to 0.954. It means that the capillary pore has the most
direct influence to the strength of concrete.
NEW PREDICTION MODEL
Prediction of the Capillary Pore Volume in Fly Ash Concrete
The non-linear regression with the statistic software (SPSS) was adopted for the
data analysis. It was done by combining the data of the capillary pore volume (Vc),
water/binder (W/B) and substitute ratios of fly ash (R). There are 54 data in total. After
trying the common regression models, the best result is shown below:
Vc=a*ln(W/B)+b*ln(R)+c*ln(Age)+d—Eq.1; R2=0.966, in which a= 0.0867, b= 0.0146,
c= -0.0149, d= 0.1832.
Prediction of the Strength of Fly Ash Concrete
The non-linear regression with the statistic software (SPSS) was done for the data
analysis in the same way. Each data including the compressive strength (f’c), capillary
pore volume (Vc), water/binder (W/B) and substitution ratios of fly ash (R). There are 54
data in total. The best result is shown below:
f’c=a*ln(W/B)+b*ln(R)+c*ln(Age)+d*ln(Vc)+e; R2=0.949, in which a= -35.69，b=
-4.34，c= 5.74， d= -5.59，e= -34.19。If we delete the capillary pore volume (Vc) from
