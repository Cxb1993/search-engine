ABSTRACT -  In this project, we present a  measurement preprocessing-based state estimation 
algorithm for maneuvering target tracking. The preprocessing scheme on received measurements is 
employed to reduce the covariance of measurement errors. This can be achieved by using a 
maximum likelihood method for yielding target’s estimated accelerations and velocities which 
result in preprocessed measurements. Preprocessed measurements are then utilized as inputs to a 
state estimator for improving the estimation performance. We then integrate the proposed method 
into the variable dimension filter (VDF) as the measurement-preprocessing based VDF without 
altering the functional structure of the VDF. Simulation results show that the proposed 
measurement-preprocessing based VDF can achieve superior performance.

method into the VDF without altering the functional structure of the VDF. As such, the simplicity 
and low computational cost of the VDF can be retained. It is demonstrated that the proposed 
measurement-preprocessing based VDF can achieve superior performance.

A.  Constant Acceleration Case 
We derive a measurement preprocessing algorithm under the situation that a target moves 
with a constant acceleration. Position measurements along −x  and −y axes at time kt  are assumed 
to be independent and to be the sum of the true position and measurement errors as follows:

threshold mλ , a maneuver is declared at time k , and a switch from the measurement-preprocessed 
quiescent model-based KF to the measurement-preprocessed maneuvering model-based KF occurs.  
B.  Modification of State Estimates 
When a maneuver is declared at time k , preprocessed measurements due to a constant 
acceleration together with the maneuvering model-based KF is employed from time Nk −  to time 
k . In addition, no detection of maneuver termination is performed. The acceleration components of 
the state estimate )|(ˆ NkNk −−x `in the measurement preprocessed maneuvering model-based KF 
are initialized as follows:  2,1=i

several presentation sessions related to control of telecommunication systems and smart grids and 
had some discussions several authors.   
二、 與會心得 
It is important to attend conferences and exchange ideas with other authors. Although the 
2010-ICUMT was a small-sized conference (about 250 papers presented), I think I had achieved the 
foregoing goal. Many researchers have been working very actively in the areas of communications 
and control---particularly, wireless communications and robot control. Researchers in the field of 
communications and control should actively disseminate their results in international flagship 
conferences in addition to esteemed international journals. To attend international conferences and 
interact with international researchers is always valuable. Above all, I would like to thank the 
National Science Council of Taiwan for partial financial support so that I can attend the 
2010-ICUMT for presenting some of my research to international researchers.
