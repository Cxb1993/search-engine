Abstract
Activated carbon was prepared from plum kernels by NaOH activation at six different NaOH/char ratios. The physical properties including
the BET surface area, the total pore volume, the micropore ratio, the pore diameter, the burn-off, and the scanning electron microscope (SEM)
observation as well as the chemical properties, namely elemental analysis and temperature programmed desorption (TPD), were measured. The
results revealed a two-stage activation process: stage 1 activated carbons were obtained at NaOH/char ratios of 0–1, surface pyrolysis being the
main reaction; stage 2 activated carbons were obtained at NaOH/char ratios of 2–4, etching and swelling being the main reactions. The physical
properties of stage 2 activated carbons were similar, and specific area was from 1478 to 1887 m2 g−1. The results of reaction mechanism of NaOH
activation revealed that it was apparently because of the loss ratio of elements C, H, and O in the activated carbon, and the variations in the surface
functional groups and the physical properties. The adsorption of the above activated carbons on phenol and three kinds of dyes (MB, BB1, and
AB74) were used for an isotherm equilibrium adsorption study. The data fitted the Langmuir isotherm equation. Various kinds of adsorbents showed
different adsorption types; separation factor (RL) was used to determine the level of favorability of the adsorption type. In this work, activated
carbons prepared by NaOH activation were evaluated in terms of their physical properties, chemical properties, and adsorption type; and activated
carbon PKN2 was found to have most application potential.

1. Introduction
Activated carbon is a widely used adsorbent in the treat-
ment of wastewater and drinking water. Adsorption type and
capacity are primarily based on the physical properties of the
pores, namely the specific surface area, the pore size and dis-
tribution. Measurement of adsorption and desorption of N2 at
77 K and scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation pro-
vided important pore characteristics; then the adsorption type
and capacity of the activated carbon could be evaluated. The
data of adsorption and desorption isotherm of N2 at 77 K are the
most investigated physical property of activated carbon. This
measurement has been used in 89% related to activated carbon
prepared from raw plant material in 2005. These data provide
not only specific area (Sp), total pore volume (Vpore), and pore

size distribution but are also used to calculate micropore vol-
ume and exterior surface area (Sext). Studying the shapes of the
isotherm curve and hysteresis can be used to infer distribution,
shape and structure of the pores inside activated carbon. This
measurement is a prerequisite. Differences in surface structure
features of activated carbon prepared from various raw materi-
als, activation methods and conditions can be investigated with
SEM observation. Surface features of activated carbon prepared
under various conditions were observed in the previous studies
[1,2]. The results were used in inferring the activation reaction
mechanism.
Factors affecting adsorption type are pore structure, surface
chemistry, and adsorbent properties. Among them functional
groups and chemical compositions play important roles in the
adsorption mechanism and capacity. Measurements of elemen-
tal analysis and temperature programmed desorption can be
employed for understanding chemical properties of activated
carbon. Chemical compositions of activated carbon were mea-
sured with elemental analysis by some investigators [3–5].

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Physical properties of activated carbon
Before designing and using the adsorption process, the pore
structure of the adsorbent must be done [18,22]. Fig. 1 shows the
curves of the 77 K N2 isotherm adsorption/desorption of the acti-
vated carbon obtained at six different values of the NaOH/char
ratio in this study. Values of NaOH/char ratio of stage 1 activated
carbon were from 0 to 1 (empty circles in the figure); those of
stage 2 were from 2 to 4 (solid circles in the figure). Fig. 1 shows
that the adsorption volume of stage 1 activated carbons did not
significantly change when the values of P/P0 were increased
from minimum to maximum, the pores are mostly straight tubes
[23]. The adsorption volume of this type of activated carbons
was low. For stage 2 activated carbon, the adsorption volumes
of PKN3 and PKN4 were almost the same (=391 cm3 g−1), that
of PKN2 somewhat lower. The adsorption volumes of these
three activated carbons increased rapidly when P/P0 was first
increased, then increased mildly, and then increased least after
P/P0 > 0.2. The tendencies of these three curves are similar, i.e.
they have similar pore size distributions.
Fig. 2 shows the pore sizes distributions. The pore sizes of
stage 1 activated carbon were mostly smaller than 2 nm; while
those of stage 2 were mostly smaller than 3 nm and gradually
disappeared for pore sizes larger than 5 nm.

by NaOH activation (carbons are PKN0 (©), PKN0.5 (), PKN1 (), PKN2
(), PKN3 (), and PKN4 (), respectively).
Table 1 lists the physical properties of activated carbon
derived from plum kernels by NaOH activation. The data show
that the Sp value of stage 1 activated carbons decreased from
290 to 113 m2 g−1 when the NaOH/char ratio increased from 0
to 1; this is different from that of carbon activated with KOH
[2]. However, the Sp value of this type of activated carbon is
too small. For the time being, they seem to be of no practi-
cal value. However, investigating the activation mechanism and
understanding this phenomenon are quite meaningful. The val-
ues of Sp and Vp of PKN2, PKN3, and PKN4, stage 2 activated
carbons, increased with an increased NaOH/char ratio, from
1478 to 1887 m2 g−1 and 0.815 to 1.049 cm3 g−1, respectively.
However, their porosity (ε), micropore ratio (Vmicro/Vp), and
Burn-off hardly increased, from 0.642 to 0.698, 0.82 to 0.86,
and 0.77 to 0.80, respectively. The average pore sizes (Dp) were
2.2 nm, revealing the similar physical properties among these
three samples of activated carbon.
Relationships between the pore characteristics of the acti-
vated carbon and the NaOH/char ratio are shown in Fig. 3a–d;
stage 1 activated carbon is represented by empty circles: stage
2 activated carbon by solid circles. Specific area, pore volume,
and micropore ratio of stage 1 activated carbon decreased with
increased NaOH/char ratio; burn-off of PKN0 was 0.5, and of
PKN0.5 and PKN1 0.71 and 0.72, respectively. This means that
burn-off of PKN0.5 had reached a new equilibrium zone. Spe-
cific area, pore volume, and micropore ratio of stage 2 activated

carbon increased significantly, meaning that a different reaction
mechanism had been triggered; and their burn-off was still main-
tained in a near equilibrium zone (0.7–0.8). It is of interest that
the Sp value increased from 183 to 1887 m3 g−1 in the burn-off
equilibrium zone (PKN0.5 to PKN4); a huge variation. This is
like making loose cakes of different porosities from the same
quantity of flour; stage 1 activated carbon can be thought of as a
dense cake of an unsuccessfully fermented product, while stage
2 carbon, as lose well-fermented cakes. So, specific area, pore
volume, and micropore ratio of Fig. 3 appear to have a tendency
to increase with increased NaOH/char ratio at stage 2.
3.2. SEM observation
Fig. 4a–d were 1000× magnified SEM photos of the acti-
vated carbon. Fig. 4a shows that PKN0 had some large holes and
walls within which there were many tiny holes, surface pyrolysis
being the primary reaction in the activation process. PKN1, in
Fig. 4b, showed severe erosion on the mouths of both the huge
and tiny holes within walls. Surface pyrolysis and NaOH etch-
ing occurred in the activation process, but only on the surface.
Thus, the BET specific surface area and the total pore volume
decreased, resulting in a decreased micropore ratio. Fig. 4c and
d show compressed and twisted holes walls due to swelling.
Swelling in PKN4 was more violent than PKN2, thus the Sp and
Vp values of PKN4 were larger.
3.3. Elemental analysis of the chemical properties of
activated carbon
In this study, the chemical compositions of activated carbon
obtained from elemental analysis are listed in Table 2. PKN0
in Table 2 is in agreement with those stated in the literatures:
elements H and O of botanic material lose more easily in the
heat treatment under oxygen-starved condition [3]. Elements H
and O were more easily lost than element C in raw plant material
in oxygen-starved pyrolysis.
Loss ratio is defined as the ratio of weight loss of a certain
element in char during activation to the weight content of that
element in char (Xchar), which can be calculated as:
X loss ratio = Xchar − Xac(1 − Burn-off)
Xchar
(1)
Fig. 5. C, H, and O loss% of activated carbon at different NaOH/char ratios.
where Xchar is the element X weight content in char and Xac is
the element X weight content in the activated carbon.
X can be any one element of C, H, and O. Loss ratios of C, H,
and O are listed in Table 2. Data in the table show that loss ratios
of H and O were higher than that of C; this is the case of raw
plant material (char) after pyrolysis; the highest loss ratios of H
and O occurred to PKN2; the highest loss ratio of C occurred
to PKN3. Fig. 5 shows the relationships between loss ratios of
C, H, and the NaOH/char ratio. C loss ratios already reached
a new equilibrium zone (0.70–0.78) with PKN0.5; H loss ratio
also reached a new equilibrium zone of 0.87–0.95 with PKN0.5.
Note that only the O loss ratio curve has a two-stage characteris-
tic: stage 1 loss ratios were between 0.69 and 0.72, while stage 2
loss ratios were between 0.84 and 0.86. This distinction between
stages is in accordance with the physical properties of Section
3.1. It can reasonably be inferred that the largely increased val-
ues of Sp and Vp of stage 2 activated carbon is because of the
increased O loss ratio. Thus, the reaction mechanism can be
assumed as:
4NaOH + C ←→ 4Na + CO2 + 2H2O (2)
The reaction mechanism was proved to exist as reported in lit-
erature [24]. Na production in Eq. (2) joins the following reaction
mechanism:
2Naoxidation−→ Na2Ohydration−→ NaOH (3)

Fig. 7. Adsorption isotherms of dyes and phenol at 30 ◦C on the PKN2 acti-
vated carbon (adsorbates are phenol (©), MB (), BB1 (), and AB74 (♦),
respectively). The solid curves were calculated with the Langmuir equation.
bon adsorption on different adsorbates shown in Fig. 7 can be
understood from the following discussion.
Dimensionless separation factor, RL, can be calculated from
the fitted Langmuir isotherm equation to determine the type of
adsorption process [28]. Separation factor, RL, is defined as:
RL = 11 + KLCi (6)
or expressed by Favorable parameter, KLCi, as
KLCi = 1 − RL
RL
(7)
Ci value in formulas (6) and (7) is the initial concentration,
the maximum value, of the adsorption process. The relationships
of RL, KLCi and type of process are shown in Table 4. The RL
value is classified as: RL > 1 meaning Unfavorable; 0 < RL < 1,
Favorable; RL = 0, Irreversible. Actually, the RL values of all
adsorbents are between 0 and 1 (Favorable type). In this work,
the RL values of PKN2 adsorption on MB, AB74, BB1, phenol
were, respectively, 0.0025, 0.0151, 0.0206, and 0.0467, which
would make them a Favorable type. But it is difficult to eval-
uate Favorable level according to RL values between 0 and 1.
In this paper, Favorable parameter, KLCi value, is suggested
to use to evaluate the Favorable level, as shown in Table 4. If
KLCi value is negative, then it is Unfavorable; if positive, Favor-
able; the larger the KLCi value, the higher the Favorable level; if
the KLCi value approaches infinite, it is an Irreversible process.
KLCi value can be employed to judge the Favorable level. For
example: in this study, the KLCi values of PKN2 adsorption on
MB, AB74, BB1, and phenol were, respectively, 392, 65, 49,
and 20. The KLCi value of adsorption on MB is in the hundreds,
Table 4

0 < RL < 1 KLCi > 0 Favorable
RL = 0 KLCi →∞ Irreversible

and therefore extremely Favorable; adsorption on AB74, BB1,
and phenol are in the tens, therefore highly Favorable; if KLCi
value is a single digit, then it is Favorable; if it is a decimal,
it is weakly Favorable. Judging the Favorable level is of great
significance for engineering applications. In this study, the KLCi
values of the adsorption of PKN2, PKN3, and PKN4 on certain
adsorbates are close, meaning they are of similar adsorption type
and highly Favorable.
3.6. Evaluation of activated carbon
For activated carbon preparation, the main cost lies in the
consumption of the activation agent. Thus, the activation agent
that produces the highest surface area per unit weight is the
most economical. Surface area obtained per unit activation agent
(SP/agent ratio) of PKN2 in Fig. 8 is the highest. Porosity, micro-
pore ratio, and burn-off of PKN2 is the lowest and bulk density
of it, the highest, among the high surface area activated carbons
(PKN2, PKN3, and PKN4). This means that PKN2 is of higher
mass transfer efficiency, higher yield, and higher mechanical
strength. Content of element C of PKN2 is higher, meeting the
chemical property of good activated carbon [29]. The adsorption
amounts per unit agent on four different adsorbates of PKN2 as
shown in Fig. 8 are the highest. Favorable levels of PKN2 on
four kinds of adsorbates are ether highly or extremely favorable.
4. Conclusions
Activated carbon prepared from the char of plum kernels
using NaOH activation were studied. Microporous activated car-
bon with a surface area from 1478 to 1887 m2 g−1 were obtained
at a NaOH/char ratio from 2 to 4. According to the pore charac-
teristics and SEM observation, it was inferred that there were two
kinds of activation mechanisms: surface pyrolysis (NaOH/char
ratio from 0 to 1) of stage 1 activated carbon; chemical etching
and swelling (NaOH/char ratio from 2 to 4) of stage 2 acti-
vated carbon. According to elemental analysis and temperature
