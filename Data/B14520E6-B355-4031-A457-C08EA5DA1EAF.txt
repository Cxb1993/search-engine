Abstract  
 
 Heterogeneous nucleation and growth 
characteristics of the bubbles on an advancing 
solidification front during the freezing of water 
containing a dissolved gas are experimentally and 
analytically studied. The formation of bubbles 
resulting from super-saturation of liquids is 
commonly encountered in different fields such as 
heat transfer, manufacturing, and bioscience. In 
this work, the sizes of bubbles and the 
concentration profiles of dissolved oxygen and 
carbon dioxide gases in the water ahead of the 
solidification front will be measured. From 
successful comparisons between the measured and 
predicted critical radius and growth of the bubbles 
and distributions of dissolved gas content, the 
phenomena of bubble growth in a binary weak 
solution during the freezing process are 
quantitatively confirmed. The results for the first 
time propose mathematical models for different 
regimes of bubble growth and the relationships 
between solidification rates, gas content in the 
liquid, free energy barrier, critical radius and 
growth of the bubbles on the solidification front.  
 
Keywords: Bubble dynamics, solidification, 
porosity in materials and manufacturing 
 
二、緣由與目的 
    
 One of the most serious problems commonly 
occurring in materials and manufacturing processes 
is porosity. Since gas solubilities in the solid state 
are often much less than those in the liquid, 
bubbles readily nucleate on the solidification front 
where the dissolved gases accumulated. Porosity 
results from the bubbles trapped by the 
solidification front. A condition for the formation 
of pores in welds has been provided by Grigorenko 
[1]. Experimental results indicated that pores in 
welds formed when the initial gas content of the 
liquid was higher than the saturated solubility in 
the solid metal at the melting point.  
 From a kinetics viewpoint, the bubble 
formation due to solute supersaturation is a process 
that occurs by the nucleation and growth of the 
new phase. Ward et al. [2] considered 
homogeneous nucleation of bubbles in a weak 
solution of liquids containing a dissolved gas. They 
predicted the effect of the dissolved gas on the 
pressure and critical radii of nucleus, the maximum 
free energy barrier and nucleation rate. Tucker and 
Ward [3] experimentally confirmed that the 
bubbles slightly larger than the critical radii grew 
while the smaller bubbles dissolved. Even though 
knowledge of nucleation has been well-known, 
detailed experimental results for heterogeneous 
nucleation of bubbles in a supersaturated liquid on 
a solidification front have not been reported in the 
literature. Confirmative results are necessary to 
understand the pore formation in a solid.  
 Wei et al. [4] first proposed a simple model to 
predict the growth of a bubble trapped in solid. 
Since gas in liquid accumulates at cap of the 
bubble by increasing solidification rate, mass

where terms dR/dt and ds/dt on the left and right-
hand sides, respectively, represent the spherical 
growth rate of the bubble and the solidification rate. 
Bubble radii in the spherical growth regime 
therefore are determined by integrating Eq. [6] by 
introducing both the spherical growth rate of the 
bubble and freezing rate. The spherical growth rate 
can be obtained by introducing a time dependent 
spherical radius NttcR −= , where t and  are 
time and nucleation time measured from the onset 
of solidification. Eq. [6] is integrated to give

五、結果討論 
 Quantitative comparisons between the 
predicted and measured bubble sizes are shown in 
Fig. 4. It can be seen that agreement is good by 
choosing input data c =    , K = 
 , T= 273 K, = 
 m/s, = 1960 Pa, ds/dt = 
 m/s in the spherical growth regime, 
while s = -8.3819  + 
1.4237  - 0.0001163 m in the 
solidification rate-controlled elongation regime. It 
should be noted that a slight, horizontal translation 
of the curves is allowed since nucleation time 
cannot be precisely determined. Eqs. [7] and [9] are 
used to calculate the time-dependent contact angle 
and radius of the bubble in the spherical growth 
regime, respectively. In the solidification rate-
controlled elongation regime, Eq. [9] gives the 
radius of the cap. 
 
六、結論 
 
 1. Development of the pore shape in solid 
during the freezing can be divided into five regimes: 
(1) nucleation on the solidification front, (2) 
spherical growth, (3) solidification rate-controlled 
elongation, (4) disappearance in the solid, and (5) 
formation of pores. 
 2. The spherical growth of the bubble on the 
solidification front is similar to the growth after 
nucleation to a macroscopic size of a bubble in a 
super-saturated solution.The gas pressure in the 
bubble in the solidification rate-controlled 
elongation regime may increase or decrease in the 
course of solidification.
