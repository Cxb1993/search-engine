二、 英文摘要 
Most of speech enhancement systems suffer 
from annoying musical residual noise which 
significantly reduces the perception quality of 
enhanced speech. In this study, we aim at 
reducing the musical residual noise by a 
two-stage speech enhancement approach. At 
the first stage, a noisy speech signal is 
enhanced by a three-step speech enhancement 
system which is constituted of two-step noise 
reduction algorithm and Virag method. Hence 
the enhanced speech signal is post-processed 
by a directional-median filter to significantly 
reduce the amount of residual noise, while the 
harmonic spectra can be well maintained at an 
acceptable level. Experimental results show 
that the proposed approach can significantly 
improve the performance of a speech 
enhancement system by reducing the quantity 
of residual noise. 
 
Keywords: Speech enhancement, residual 
noise, spectral subtraction, median filter,

貳、報告內容 
一、 前言 
Speech enhancement is useful in many 
applications such as voice communication and 
automatic speech recognition. Recently, many 
novel schemes (Bahoura and Rouat, 2006; 
Benesty et al., 2010; Chen and Loizou, 2007; 
Ding et al., 2009; Ghanbari and 
Karami-Mollaei, 2006; Gunawan et al., 2010; 
Johnson et al., 2007; Jo and Yoo, 2010; Lu and 
Wang; 2007; Lu 2008; Lu and Tseng, 2010; 
Lu et al., 2010; 2011; Plapous et al., 2006; 
Udrea et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2008) proposed 
enhancing a speech signal which is corrupted 
by additive noise. Although their improvement 
is presented in terms of background noise 
reduction, the main drawback is the 
 3
that the properties of musical tone in the 
spectrogram are similar to that of the 
impulse noise in the spatial domain. 
Consequently, those techniques can be 
modified and applied for removing the 
musical tones in the spectrogram, enabling 
musical residual noise to be significantly 
removed. 
 
四、 研究方法 
Based on the above findings, utilizing 
the noise masking properties of the human ear 
to adapt a speech enhancement system is 
beneficial to obtain less quantity of speech 
distortion. However, the magnitude of residual 
noise is still apparent and annoying to 
deteriorate the speech quality in the enhanced 
speech. In this paper, we proposed improving 
the performance of the Virag method (Virag, 
1999) in the frequency domain. In the first 
stage, the proposed approach is to improve the 
estimated spectra of speech by the 
two-step-decision-directed algorithm (Plapous 
et al., 2006), enabling the noise masking 
threshold to be well estimated. Substituting 
this threshold to the Virag method, the 
performance of the Virag method is then 
improved. Integrating both the 
two-step-decision-directed and the Virag 
methods forms a three-step speech 
enhancement system. Noisy speech is firstly 
processed by the three-step method to produce 
a preprocessed signal. In order to reduce a 
quantity of residual noise, we proposed 
cascading a directional median filter as a 
second stage to post-process the preprocessed 
speech. Firstly, the spectral variation for each 
spectral bin in the spectrogram is analyzed. If 
a spectral bin is classified as the harmonic 
spectrum of a voiced signal, it is kept 
unchanged to maintain speech quality. 
Conversely, if the spectral bin is classified as a 
musical tone, it is modified by the median 
spectrum on an optimum direction in a 
window. So the magnitude of musical tone is 
reduced. In order to improve the performance, 
the directional median filter is iteratively 
performed to remove a quantity of residual 
noise. Accordingly, the proposed method can 
efficiently suppressed the musical residual 
noise, while the speech spectra are only 
slightly impacted. Experimental results show 
that the proposed approach can significantly 
improve the performances of the Virag (1999) 
method by reducing a quantity of residual 
noise, while the speech distortion can also be 
maintained at an acceptable level. In addition, 
the proposed approach also outperforms the 
two-step-decision-directed (TSDD) speech 
enhancement algorithm (Plapous et al., 2006) 
in most experiments.  
 
4.1. Proposed speech enhancement system 
The block diagram of proposed speech 
enhancement system is shown in Fig. 1. 
Firstly, a noisy speech signal is transformed 
into the frequency domain. The 
two-step-decision-directed (TSDD) algorithm 
(Plapous et al., 2006) is employed to enhance 
noisy speech. The enhanced speech is only 
used to find the noise masking threshold 
(NMT) which is applied in the Virag method 
for adapting the generalized spectral 
subtraction algorithm, rather than to be the 
output signal in the first stage. Noisy speech is 
filtered by the Virag method. The output 
signal is called preprocessed speech. Owing to 
the preprocessed speech consisting of plenty 
musical tones, a post processing system is 
required to remove them.  
In this study, we use an iterative- 
directional-median filter (IDMF) to refine the 
preprocessed signal. This filter is a two-

In the reconstruction phase for 
implementation, The phase of the noisy 
speech is not modified, so the enhanced 
speech signal can be obtained by the

as

where ),(Sˆ ωm  is the output spectrum of the 
IDMF. 
 
4.2. Three-step speech enhancement 
A speech enhancement adapted by the 
noise masking properties of the human ear is 
beneficial to result in less amounts of 
annoying musical residual noise (Gustafsson 
et al., 1998; Gunawan et al., 2010; Hu and 
Loizou, 2004b; Jo and Yoo, 2010; Lu and 
Wang, 2004; 2007; Lu and Tseng, 2010; Udrea 
et al., 2008; Virag, 1999). Virag method 
employed noise masking properties to adapt 
the generalized power spectral subtraction 
algorithm, enabling the residual noise to 
sound less annoying in the enhanced speech. 
Thus we employ the Virag method (Virag, 
1999) to preprocess a noisy speech signal. 
Traditional methods using 
power-spectral-subtraction method to roughly 
estimate the speech spectra can provide 
acceptable performance, however the 
performance can be further improved. In this 
study, we propose finding a better speech 
spectral estimate by the 
two-step-decision-directed (TSDD) method 
(Plapous et al., 2006). In turn, this spectral 
estimate is employed to compute the noise 
masking threshold, enabling the performance 
of the Virag method to be improved by 
removing more amount of background noise. 
The spectral estimate of a speech signal

factor )ω,(mg  with the spectra of noisy 
speech as expressed in (2). The gain factor can

Applying the speech spectra estimate

more accurate than that obtained by the 
power-spectral-subtraction algorithm. The 
estimated NMT is then improved, enabling the 
 7
residual noise in the preprocessed signal, this 
spectrum is modified by the median value on 
the optimum direction of the center spectrum, 
enabling the spectral variation to be reduced. 
Experimental results show that the musical 
residual noise can be significantly removed by 
the proposed IDMF, while the speech 
distortion is very slight.  
 
4.4.  Detection of musical tone 
    Although the preprocessed speech 
obtained by the three-step speech 
enhancement system is acceptable, the 
musical residual noise of the preprocessed 
signal is still apparent and annoying to the 
human ear, especially for the heavy noise 
corruption conditions. In order to reduce the 
magnitude and the quantity of residual noise, 
we propose detecting musical tone and 
attenuating the tone for the preprocessed 
signal. 
The musical tone tends to be isolated and 
randomly appear in the spectrogram. We 
analyze the properties of spectral bin motion 
as shown in Fig. 2. The central spectrum 
represented in filled circle is analyzed and 
named as reference spectrum. initially, the 
motion direction is decided by finding the 
smallest spectral distance among the four 
directions for the reference spectrum. In turn, 
we classify the reference spectrum to a 
musical tone or harmonic spectrum by the 
spectral distance along the optimum direction. 
If the spectral distance varies largely among 
the neighbors, the reference spectrum is 
classified to a musical tone spectrum which 
should be modified by the IDMF. On the 
contrary, if the spectral distance varies 
smoothly among the neighbors, the reference 
can be regarded as harmonic spectrum. This 
spectrum is kept unchanged to maintain 
speech quality. 
An example of 5X5 widow centered at the 
subband ω  of frame m is shown in Fig. 2. 
Firstly, the optimum motion direction of the 
reference spectrum should be selected among 
the four directions (1-4). The decision rule is 
to find the minimum spectral-distance among 
the four directions. The spectral-distance 
measure )ω,()( md i  can be expressed as

Fig.2. Motion directions of the reference 
spectrum for musical tone detection. 
 
  In the case of voiced spectrum, the 
magnitude of spectra adjacent to the reference 
spectrum should be close to that of the 
reference spectrum. Thus the value of 
spectral-distance weight should be larger than 
that of not adjacent to the reference spectrum.

In order to mitigate the fluctuation of

where ◊  denotes repetition operator. 
),( ω∆∆mW  represents repetition number as 
given in (14). 
  In order to improve the efficiency of 
removing isolated musical tone, the 
directional median filtering is iteratively 
performed. As shown in Fig. 3, the number the 
iteration increases, the reduction is the 
quantity of the musical tones, especially 
during the speech-pause regions. Observing 
the spectrograms in a vowel region shown in 
Fig. 3(d), the harmonic spectra are well 
preserved without deterioration. Thus the 
speech quality is maintained at a high level. 
On the other hand, we can observe the 
spectrogram during speech-pause regions. The 
musical residual noise is significantly 
removed by the directional median filter when 
the iteration number goes high. Accordingly, 
the proposed method is beneficial to remove 
more amount of residual noise, enabling the 
enhanced speech to sound less annoying than 
that without using the IDMF. 
The replacing threshold )(mΘ  given in (17) 
plays a major role in deciding whether the 
reference spectrum is musical tone or not. If 
the reference spectrum is a musical tone, the 
corresponding replacing threshold )(mΘ  
should be adjusted to a small value. It 
increases the probability for classifying the 
reference spectrum to musical tone. 
Conversely, the reference spectrum should be 
maintained without change in a 
speech-dominant subband, especially in the 
harmonic spectrum of a vowel. The 
corresponding replacing threshold )(mΘ  
should be adjusted to a larger value than that 
in noise-dominant subband. Accordingly, this 
replacing threshold )(mΘ  can be adapted by 
the classification category, i.e., either vowel or 
non-vowel.  
In order to reduce the spectral fluctuation 
for a noise subband, adjusting the decreasing 
ratio to a low value is performed. It increases 
the probability of classifying reference 
spectrum to a musical tone, enabling the 
reference spectrum to be modified by the 
directional median filter. Therefore, the 
magnitude of musical residual noise produced 
in this subband can be reduced. Conversely, if 
a reference spectrum belongs to the harmonic 
of a vowel, the decreasing ratio for replacing 
ratio should be kept at a high value. It 
prevents the reference spectrum from being 
classified to a musical tone. The harmonic 
spectrum of a vowel will not be deteriorated 
by the directional median filter, yielding 
speech quality to be maintained. 
Figure 3 presents the spectral variation 
between the residual noise containments and 
iteration number. It can be found that the 
quantity of residual noise is significantly 
reduced as the number of iteration increasing, 
while the harmonic spectra of a vowel do not 
be deteriorated. The major reason is that the 
replacing threshold (i)Θ  is adapted by the 
iteration number.  
 11
tracking method is based on the observation 
that even during speech activity a short-term 
power density estimate of the noisy signal 
frequently decays to values which are 
representative of the noise level. This method 
rests on the fundamental assumption that 
during speech pause or within brief periods in 
between words and syllables, the speech 
energy is close or identical to zero. Thus, by 
tracking the minimum power within a finite 
window large enough to bridge high power 
speech segments, the noise floor can be 
estimated. Detailed procedure of the minimum 
statistics noise estimation algorithm can be 
found in (Martin, 2001). 
 
4.2. Segmental SNR improvement 
The amounts of noise reduction, residual 
noise and speech distortion can be measured 
by the average segmental SNR improvement 
(Avg_SegSNR_Imp). The average of 
segmental SNR (Avg_SegSNR) of a test signal 
is evaluated according to clean speech

 The Avg_SegSNR_Imp is computed by 
subtracting the Avg_SegSNR of noisy speech 
from that of enhanced speech. Table 1 
presents the performance comparisons in 
terms of the Avg_SegSNR_Imp for various 
methods. All of the speech enhancement 
algorithms provide significant Avg_SNR 
improvement in low-SNR environments

The best performances are obtained in the 
cases of car noise corruption. This is due to 
the fact that the spectra of car noise are mostly 
concentrated in low-frequency subbands and 
the variations of spectral magnitude are 
stationary. Consequently, the magnitude of 
noise can be accurately estimated by the noise 
estimation method (Martin, 2001), enabling 
the added noise to be efficiently removed by a 
speech enhancement system. In most 
experiments, the proposed approach 
outperforms the other two methods, such as 
white, F16-cockpit, factory, helicopter-cockpit, 
 13
performance of the proposed method mostly 
approaches the better one of the TSDD and 
the Virag methods.

4.4. Waveforms 
Figures 4 and 5 demonstrate two 
examples of waveform plots for comparison. 
A speech signal uttered by a female speaker 
was corrupted by white and F16-cockpit noise 
with Avg_SegSNR = 0 dB. In Figs. 4(c)-(e) 
and 5(c)-(e), a clipped signal is absent at the 
output waveforms of the three speech 
enhancement methods. It is due to that all of 
the speech enhancement systems employ the 
minimum statistics algorithm (Martin, 2001) 
which does not over estimate the noise level 
for each subband, enabling these methods not 
to over-attenuate the noisy speech signals. 
Speech quality can be well maintained by 
preserving the speech signals in a region with 
high SNR. In Figs. 4(c)-(e), the quantity of 
residual noise is the most for the Virag 
method (Fig. 4(d)), especially for 
speech-pause regions. Conversely, the 
proposed method is better able to remove 
residual noise, yielding the quantity of the 
residual noise to be the least. Comparing Figs. 
5(c)-(e), the speech information can also be 
well preserved by the three speech 
enhancement method. It also can be found that 
the proposed method is also better able to 
remove background noise than the other two 
methods. Although the first stage of the 
proposed method is the combination of the 
TSDD and the Virag methods, the ability in 
removing background noise of the three-step 
gain factor is only slightly better than the 
other two methods. The quantity of residual 
noise is still high in the preprocessed speech. 
Accordingly, we proposed using 
iterative-directional-median filter (IDMF) as a 
second stage to further suppress residual noise. 
In Figs. 4 and 5, one can find out the residual 
noise is significantly remove by the proposed 
IDMF.

is efficiently removed by the proposed method, 
while the harmonic structure of vowel is well 
reserved. A muffled effect is absent in the

3.結論 
Employing an iterative-directional-median 
filter (IDMF) to post-process an enhanced 
speech signal is proposed in this study. The 
major contribution of this project is to 
efficiently remove the quantity of residual 
noise. Especially, an isolated random spectral 
peak of residual noise can be efficiently 
mitigated by analyzing the motion direction of 
a spectral bin, enabling the enhanced speech 
to sound less annoying than the other 
state-of-the-art speech enhancement systems. 
The proposed method is based on the 
harmonic spectra of a voiced signal with a 
smaller spectral variation over the neighbors, 
thus we can preserve the harmonic spectra 
without changing them to maintain speech 
quality. On the other hand, an isolated random 
spectral peak varies seriously over its 
neighbors. We can detect and remove the 
musical tones of residual noise by the 
proposed IDMF, yielding the residual noise to 
sound less annoying. Experimental results 
show that the proposed approach cannot only 
significantly improve the performances of the 
TSDD and the Virag methods in removing the 
annoying musical residual noise, but also 
ensures speech quality to be maintained at 
high level. Accordingly, the proposed IDMF 
can significantly improve a speech 
enhancement system by efficiently removing 
the musical residual noise.

Prof. Lin, Wen-Piao (Editor) Overall Recommendation:  
====================================================== 
Not acceptable in its present form reasons given above, but may be 
resubmitted after major revision.  
 
Comments:  
This paper presented the spectral estimation of speech to play a major role in 
computing the noise masking threshold. The authors find a better speech 
spectral estimation by a modified two-step-decision-directed method. 
Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the 
two-step-decision-directed and the Virag algorithms in most conditions. The 
manuscript need to modify as follow:  
1. In the second paragraph of Introduction section, the literature survey is 
not well organized, such that readers cannot have an overall picture on the 
problems and contributions of the proposed method. Moreover, in the third 
paragraph associated with the brief summarization, the authors comment that 
magnitude of residual noise is apparent and audible by utilizing the noise 
masking methods. It is strange because the proposed method performs an 
enhancement work based on the noise masking methods. Why do the authors 
still adopt the decision-directed approach to estimate appropriate noise 
masking thresholds?  
2. In this manuscript, a major contribution is made to calculate an adaptive 
smoothing factor on the SNR of a subband, rather than to use a constant 
value. However, as compared to the two-step-decision-directed approach, it 
is not discriminative enough in the proposed three-step-decision approach. 
Authors are suggested to detail about this.

enables the performance of Virag method to be significantly improved. 
Especially, experimental results show that the proposed approach cannot 
only significantly improve the performance of the Virag method in removing 
more amounts of residual noise, but also ensures speech quality at a high 
level. Consequently, the proposed approach can be regarded as an improved 
version of the Virag and of the TSDD methods.  
 
Minor comments:  
1. A flowchart of proposed three-step-decision method is desired to improve 
the clarity for this paper.  
2. Page 17, the item label of subtitle "D. Spectrograms" should be corrected.

value. However, as compared to the two-step-decision-directed approach, it 
is not discriminative enough in the proposed three-step-decision approach. 
Authors are suggested to detail about this.  
3. In order to attain the results of Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality 
(PESQ) on Section IV.C (should be Section IV. D), how many people are 
tested for the PESQ evaluation? Authors need describe the evaluation 
settings.  
4. By taking a closer look in Table 4, the car-noise-type results of the 
proposed method have the best performance as compared to the results from 
other three methods. However, some evaluations on the car-noise-type 
category of Tables 1 to 3 do not show the consistent results. Authors need 
more discussions on this.  
5. In Section III.D, it is not clear to describe the phenomenon about noise 
estimator design.
