Abstract 
This project is devoted to the study of 
employing quarter-wavelength stepped- 
impedance resonators (λ/4 SIRs) in the 
design of new microwave multi-band 
bandpass filters (BPFs). The efforts are 
placed on new structure development, 
performance improvement, circuit 
miniaturization, and study of new 
signal-feeding configurations of the 
multi-band BPFs. For the development of the 
dual band BPFs, the dependence of the 
second resonant frequency on impedance 
ratio of the SIRs is employed to design the 
second passband. To improve the stopband 
characteristic, a technique implementing 
loaded anti-parallel coupled lines to the SIRs 
will be adopted. The loaded anti-parallel 
coupled lines is able to produce an extra 
transmission zero at the desired stopband 
location, hence the rejection can be improved. 
Other dual band BPFs, such as the one 
constructed by double 2nd-order BPFs to 
enhance its coupling and reduce the insertion 
loss, and the one using new feeding structure 
will also be studied. 
For development of the tri-band BPFs, 
we propose an BPF configuration using 
single feed to the combined SIRs. The point 
for designing the new tri-band BPF is to 
purposely make the length of the strip 
segments of the two SIRs, which connect 
the feed point and the ground, the same. In 
such a way, the two SIRs can share the 
same strip segment and only one strip line 
is needed to feed both SIRs. The proposed 
tri-band BPF with this simplified feed 
configuration is expected to be able to

Fig. 1. The U-shaped / 4λ  SIR. 
In this design, the / 4λ  SIR which has 
a via-hole connected to ground at one end is 
bent into a U shape for compactness, as 
shown in Fig. 1. Line segments 1l  and 2l  
( 3l  and 4l ) of the U-shaped SIR have a 
width of 1W  ( 2W ) and a characteristic 
impedance of Z2 (Z1). With W1 = 0.45 mm 
pre-selected for Z1 = 54 Ω, the width W2 thus 
becomes 2 mm after fine turning in simulation. 
Also, the lengths 1l , 2l , 3l , 4l , and P are 
determined to be 5.7, 1.225, 2.05, 5.725, and 
0.775, respectively, all in the unit of mm. 
Moreover, the diameter D of the via is chosen 
to be 0.6 mm in this study. 
Two / 4λ -SIR dual-band BPFs, one 
being of the second order and the other of the 
fourth order, are designed in this study using 
the SIR shown in Fig. 1. However, due to 
limited length of the report, only results of the 
fourth-order one are shown here. Figure 2 
shows the photograph of the fabricated 
fourth-order, whose circuit measures only 
19.7 ×  11 mm2.  
 
Fig. 2. The photograph of the fabricated 
fourth-order BPF.  
Figure 3 shows the simulated results of the 
fourth-order Butterworth BPF. The filter is 
designed with 8%Δ =  for the 2.45 GHz 
band and 6%Δ =  for the 5.25 GHz bands. 
The element values of the low-pass filter 
prototype are 0g  = 5g  = 1, 1g  = 4g  = 
0.7654, and 2g  = 3g  = 1.8478. The 
coupling coefficients obtained are M1,2 = M3,4 
= 0.067 and M2,3 = 0.043 at 2.45 GHz, and 
M1,2 = M3,4 = 0.05 and M2,3 = 0.032 at 5.25 
GHz. These coupling coefficients give rise to 
a gap spacing between narrow sections d = 
0.5 mm and an offset length u = 0 mm, and a 
gap spacing between broad sections e = 0.7 
mm, and an offset length v = 3.2 mm. 
Moreover, the filter specifications yield 
external quality factors 1eQ  = 9.57 and 2eQ  
= 12.76, from which the optimized length of 
the feed position (measured from the SIR end) 
t = 2.4 mm can be obtained after fine tuning 
in simulation. The measured fractional 
bandwidths (minimum insertion losses) for 
the 2.45 and 5.25 GHz bands are 7.14 % (2.43 
dB) and 5.14 % (2.7 dB), respectively. The 
measured third passband center frequency 
around 9.85 GHz is seen to be very close to 
the predicted one.

(2) Design of Dual-Band BPFs with Spiral 
λ/4 SIRs [6] 
In this part, the λ/4 SIR is designed in 
spiral shape for circuit size reduction. The 
proposed spiral SIR is depicted in Fig. 4. Fig.

versus the spacing between the two spiral 
SIRs. Figure 6 shows the simulated results of

edges to give a shaper fall-off response. In 
addition, to improve the selectivity of the first 
passband, a 0° tapped-feed technique for the 
input and output SIRs is adopted to produce 
transmission zeros at the passband edges. A 
prototype of the proposed BPF was fabricated 
in a 0.635-mm-thick RT/Duroid 6010 
substrate and measured to verify this 
dual-band BPF design. 
 
Fig. 7. A BPF constructed using a pair of 
/ 2λ  SIRs and two end-connected / 4λ  
SIRs.  
In Fig. 7, the fundamental and the first 
higher resonant frequencies (namely, 2.45 
GHz and 5.2 GHz) of the λ/2 SIRs and λ / 4  
SIRs are designed to be the same and serve as 
the center frequencies of the two desired 
passbands. However, since the SIRs are of 
different types, their second higher resonant 
frequencies (or the first spurious harmonics) 
can be designed separated to obtain a wider 
stopband bandwidth. The proposed BPF 
circuit is designed on a 0.635-mm-thick 
RT/Duroid 6010 substrate with a dielectric 
constant of 10.2 and a loss tangent of 0.0023. 
The needed fractional 3-dB bandwidth for 
2.45 GHz and 5.2 GHz bands are 3.5 % (2.4 
GHz – 2.484 GHz) and 3.8 % (5.15 GHz – 
5.35 GHz), respectively. Using quasi-elliptic 
function as the desired BPF response, the 
element values for the lowpass filter prototype 
can be found as 0g = 1 and 1g = 0.95242. The 
required external quality factors of the input 
and output λ/2 SIRs (  and ei eoQ Q , 
respectively) can be calculated from  
= ei eo eQ Q Q= =  0 1g gΔ  , where Δ  is the 
3-dB fractional bandwidth of the filter.  
Following the design procedure outlined 
in [7], the structural parameters for this 
prototype BPF circuit are L11 = 5.07, L12 = 
7.47, L13 = 1.69, L14 = 1.97, L21 = 3.95, L22 = 
2.6, L23 = 3.78, L24 = 1.82, , L25 = 2.705, L26 = 
1.49, W11 = 1, W12 = 0.54, W21 = 2.1, W22 = 
0.44, S1 = 0.8, S2 = 0.448, and D = 0.95 (all 
units are in mm). Figure 8 shows the 
simulated and measured frequency responses 
of the dualband BPF. The measured results 
are in very good agreement with those 
obtained from simulation, which was done by 
using HFSSTM, a full-wave electromagnetic 
simulator. Shown in Fig. 9 is the photograph 
of the fabricated dual-band BPF, which 
measures only 9.24 ×  15.07 mm2.

(5) Design of a New Tri-band Microstrip 
BPF Using Combined Quarter-wavelength 
SIRs [9] 
In the final part of this report, we present 
a new tri-band microstrip BPF that can be 
operated at 1.57-GHz GPS L1 channel and 
2.45/5.25 GHz WLAN bands. The building 
block used to construct this tri-band BPF 
comprises two λ/4 SIRs, one of which 
resonates at 1.57 and 5.25 GHz (denoted by f1 
and f2, respectively) and the other at 2.45 GHz 
(called f3). These two λ/4 SIRs are carefully 
combined to share part of their structures for 
miniaturization purposes and meanwhile retain 
individual bandpass characteristic.  
 
Fig. 13. Schematic of the proposed tri-band 
microstrip BPF printed on a circuit board. 
Figure 13 shows the geometry of the 
proposed tri-band microstrip BPF. In this 
figure, the vias that connect the microstrip 
lines to the ground plane are denoted by 
circles having a diameter of D. The line 
segments L1a, L1b, and L1c (L2a and L2b) have a 
width of W1 (W2) and a characteristic 
impedance of Z1 (Z2). These five line segments 
in conjunction with the via form a λ/4 SIR 
(denoted by SIR A) that is designed to 
resonate at f1 and f2. Similarly, the line 
segments L1a, L1d, and L1e (L3) have a width of 
W1 (W3) and a characteristic impedance of Z1 
(Z3). These four line segments together with 
the via constitute another λ/4 SIR (denoted by 
SIR B) that resonates at f3. SIRs A and B, with 
the line segment L1a and the via shared by each 
other, are combined to form a tri-band 
resonator. The proposed tri-band microstrip 
BPF is then composed of two such resonators 
which are coupled through anti-parallel 
coupled sections L2b in SIR A and L3 in SIR B. 
For the desired three bands, the fractional 
bandwidths needed around f1, f2, and f3, are 
about 3% (1557-1593 MHz), 4% (5150-5350 
MHz), and 4% (2400-2484 MHz), respectively. 
On the safe side and for convenience, we set 
the initial goal for the three fractional 
bandwidths to be 8%. This value has been set 
larger than the actually needed ones, for fear 
that the performance of the realized filter may 
be downgraded from its original design due to 
imperfection in fabrication. Using the second- 
order Butterworth response as the target, we 
find the element values for the low-pass filter 
prototype to be g0 = g3 = 1 and g1 = g2 = 
1.4142. The required Qe (defined by 
0 1eQ g g /= Δ  with Δ  being the fractional 
bandwidth of the filter) for these three bands 
can be found to be 17.7, and this can be used 
to determine the feed position to the combined 
SIRs.  
Figure 14 shows the simulated and the 
measured frequency responses of the 
fabricated tri-band BPF, whose dimensions are 
L2a = 5.2, L2b = 4, L1c = 2.145, L1b = 4.185, L1a 
= 1.73, L1d = 1.98, L1e = 1.605, L3 = 5.17, W2 
= 0.7, W1 = 0.54, W3 = 1.09, S1 = 0.2, S2 = 0.5, 
and D = 0.5 (all units are in mm). The 
measurement results agree quite well with 
those obtained from simulation (except in the 
high-frequency region). The measured 3-dB
