英 文 摘 要 ： High sludge concentration and extracellular polymeric 
substances (EPS) or soluble microbial products (SMP) 
have been determined to be the major factors 
affecting membrane  Thus, the BER was coupled with 
membrane as bio-entrapped membrane reactor (BEMR) was 
investigated the SMP, and also compared with 
conventional membrane bioreactor (CMBR) with the 
overall study goal is to reduce membrane fouling 
commonly encountered in MBRs. 
 
The results show that BER with a longer sludge 
retention time (SRT) has demonstrated that membrane 
filtration performed well and achieved an 
approximately 25%-30% higher filtration flux and 
better flux recovery after backwashing than the 
activated sludge process (ASP) system. The BEMR could 
remove the carbon and ammonia nitrogen with more than 
90% under different hydraulic retention time (HRT). 
The novel BEMR sustained operation at constant 
permeate flux (20 LMH) that required seven times less 
frequent chemical cleaning than did the conventional 
membrane bioreactor. Membrane fouling was improved in 
the new reactor, which led to a longer membrane 
service period with the new reactor. As in the CMBR, 
rapid membrane fouling was attributed to increased 
production of biomass and SMP, this is because the 
BEMR produced less SMP than did CMBR (34%-48% less 
protein and 16%-29% less carbohydrate) due to slow-
growing microorganisms with longer SRT in the BEMR. 
Further, results of this thesis also indicated that 
suspended solids and bound EPS unexpectedly played a 
negligible role in membrane fouling and the fouling 
was actually controlled by SMP, which proved the SMP

Membrane fouling was improved in the new reactor, which led to a longer membrane 
service period with the new reactor. As in the CMBR, rapid membrane fouling was 
attributed to increased production of biomass and SMP, this is because the BEMR 
produced less SMP than did CMBR (34%-48% less protein and 16%-29% less 
carbohydrate) due to slow-growing microorganisms with longer SRT in the BEMR. 
Further, results of this thesis also indicated that suspended solids and bound EPS 
unexpectedly played a negligible role in membrane fouling and the fouling was actually 
controlled by SMP, which proved the SMP was the major contributor or foulant to the 
membrane fouling. Both MBRs (BEMR and CMBR) produced SMP of 10-100 kDa 
primarily of protein (59% in BEMR and 64% in CMBR), which likely caused 
membrane pores clogging because the 10-100 kDa of SMP could easily penetrate to the 
membrane pores by adsorption in a 100 kDa membrane used in this work. The impact of 
protein and carbohydrate to the membrane fouling was also been found because, the 
findings with L-Tyrosine and glucose as the model foulants for protein and carbohydrate 
respectively showed that protein (L-Tyrosine) caused more severe permeate flux decline 
than carbohydrate (glucose). 
 
The conclusion stated that the bio-entrapped membrane reactor could really improve the 
MBR performance by reducing the membrane fouling and producing less concentration 
of SMP with conventional membrane bioreactor. Therefore, the new BEMR offers 
effective organics removal while reducing membrane fouling with the potential for 
improving and encountering the current problems faced by conventional MBR.

CHAPTER 1 
INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Problem Definition 
Membrane technologies are still being developed in a rapid way among the well 
developed countries because of membrane plays an important role as a major 
treatment technology in achieving very high quality effluent for water reuse, 
improving water quality and protecting public health. Membrane technology is 
believed to be very effective to reduce and eliminate unwanted contaminants and 
pollutants in the aquatic environment. Besides, membrane technologies do not involve 
phase changes and chemical additives as well as easy to scale up which preserve 
environmental friendly to the society. Ultrafiltration (UF) is one of many types of 
membrane filtration and able to remove the particulate matters, bacteria and most 
viruses and colloids. Moreover, attention is being given to the employment of 
modified membrane characteristics, reduced membrane cost and their ability to 
remove different contaminants in the secondary treatment of municipal wastewater. 
 
Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) refer to the combination of membrane technology and 
biological process in treating the wastewater. The bioreactor is operated similar to a 
conventional activated sludge process but do not require the secondary sedimentation. 
MBR technology has been widely used in recent years and more than 2200 MBRs 
have been installed and operated by year 2004 (Yang et al., 2006) and the global 
MBR market is rising which has approximately US$ 216.6 million (BCC, 2006). The 
MBRs have have advantages over conventional activated sludge (CAS) systems such 
as in high removal efficiency, stable and good effluent qualities, small footprint, short 
hydraulic retention time (HRT), simple operation, ease in maintenance of high 
 3 
 
The first fundamental question has been widely investigated by using various methods, 
i.e., Te Posle et al. (2004) used the filtration and filterability tests, size exclusion 
chromatography (SEC) by Drew et al. (2005) and Rosenberger et al. (2006), or 
colleration studies between sludge in the CAS and membrane fouling (Fan et al., 
2006). The results have illustrated that MBR fouling is mostly related to the collioids 
and soluble organic fraction in the MBR sludge. For example, the suspended solids 
and colloids, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and soluble microbial products 
(SMP) have been found to be the major foulants affecting membrane bioreactor 
operation because of the higher MLSS concentration and short sludge retention time 
(SRT). Recently, nearly all the studies have pointed out the EPS and SMP that 
produced by the microorganisms are the key factor and foulant to the MBR.  
 
The second fundamental questions that still remains unanswered relates to what is the 
main composition of SMP. Many SMP studies are done, but found in most 
biologically treated effluents, SMP contributes significantly to soluble organic matter 
and chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the effluent (Barker and Stuckey, 1999; Zhou 
et al., 2009). Further studies on the molecular weight of SMP are needed because the 
deposition of SMP on membrane surface and pore blocking should be well-define and 
requires more studies under various flux and operating conditions. 
 
The third fundamental quetion related to develop a new membrane bioreactor is 
probably the most difficult one, as it is related to the first two fundamental question 
but also many other operational conditions of the MBR. Since the mixed liqour 
suspended solids (MLSS) might have directly impact on membrane fouling, several 
studies (Leiknes and Ødegaard, 2007; Lee et al., 2006; Artiga et al., 2005; Ivanovic et 
al., 2006) have studied moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) coupled with membrane 
 5 
 
order to investigate the role of SMP on membrane fouling and the 
characteristics of SMP from two different membrane bioreactors. i.e., the 
composition and molecular weight distribution that correlate with membrane 
fouling and membrane cleaning of BEMR and CMBR 
 
4. To investigate the influence of proteins and carbohydrates in membrane 
fouling. 
 
1.3 Importance of Study 
BER and BEMR with a longer SRT is the prerequisite to hamper the membrane 
fouling by producing less EPS and SMP. Therefore, BER and BEMR  has the 
potential for improvement and/or replacement of the existing conventional membrane 
bioreactors to increase the lifespan of membrane by reducing the membrane fouling. 
An overall study goal is to reduce membrane fouling commonly encountered in 
MBRs.

Extractive membrane bioreactors (EMBRs) were found to enhance the performance of 
biological treatment of wastewater by exploiting the membrane’s ability to achieve 
high degree of separation while transporting to another phase of membrane. EMBRs 
are designed to extract the specific organic pollutants in the wastewaters to 
biodegrade the pollutants, such as high salinity, extreme pH values, that may inhibit 
the biodegradation process. The EMBRs successfully remove selected extract 
organics such as chloethanes, chlorobenzenes, chloroanilies, toluene (Visvanathan and 
Ben Aim, 2000). The targeted organic pollutants can be concentrated into an 
optimized bioreactor and biodegraded without the effect of those inorganic materials 
and extreme conditions in the EMBRs. This is because the driving force of the 
targeting organic pollutants is their concentration gradient, which is high grade on the 
feed wastewater side but low on the bioreactor side.  
 
Biomass separation MBRs are the most often used MBRs in the wastewater treatment 
plants. This is because the activated sludge process is the most widely and reliability 
aerobic wastewater treatment system to treat the municipal and industrial wastewaters. 
The application of biomass separation MBRs is to use a MF/UF membrane to replace 
the CAS process to overcome the disadvantages of the sedimentation process, short 
sludge retention time (SRT), small footprint, high removal efficiency, ease in 
maintenance of high biomass concentration and enhance nitrification (Meng et al., 
2007; Malamis and Andreadakis, 2009). In this system, the solid-liquid membrane 
separation bioreactor employs filtration modules as effective barriers and that the 
membrane unit can be operated either external to or immersed in the bioreactor 
(Visvanathan and Ben Aim, 2000).

2.1.2.3 Advantage and Disadvantage of membrane bioreactors 
The MBR application is actually a new development of the conventional activated 
sludge (CAS) process. This is due to the invention of MBRs is to overcome the 
limitation in the CAS process especially the biomass separation in the secondary 
clarifier. The advantages and disadvantages of MBR are summarized in Table 2.1.

Fouling causes a rapid, reversible and irreversible loss of flux through the membrane. 
There are various factors affecting the membrane fouling and the results are 
summarized in Table 2.2. With hydraulic backwash, the flux usually is restored to a 
certain extent and water flow backwards through the membrane and causes the partial 
removal of the deposited matter on the membrane surface. The permeability and flux 
will back to normal or initial stage of the membrane. However, fouling is not always 
can be removed or cleaned by backwashing because some deposited matters are 
causing irreversible fouling which occurred inside the membrane pore (Katsoufidou et 
al., 2005). Fouling arises from specific interactions between the membrane and the 
components in the raw water due to the interactions between the particles. It has been 
observed that the electrostatic interactions between the NOM molecules play an 
important role on the fouling. For example, decreasing the pH or increasing the ionic 
strength in the water solution may reduce the formation of gel layer and adsorption 
occurs (Katsofidou et al., 2005).

filter cake that related to the particulate fouling. The particulates can either be 
suspended solids, colloids and even microorganisms. It was found that the dominant 
type of fouling in most MF and UF systems are the particulate fouling that forming 
the cake layer on the membrane surface. However, using the MF and UF membrane in 
the MBRs is suffering more colloidal and organic fouling. Cake layer formation 
(Figure 2.3) linked with removable fouling was considered as the one of the major 
contributors to membrane fouling in MBRs. Lee et al. (2001) reported that the 
filtration resistances included membrane resistance (12%), cake resistance (80%), 
blocking and irremovable fouling resistance (8%), conducting that the formation of 
cake layer is the main cause leading to membrane fouling. The cake layer offers an 
additional resistance to the membrane filtration once the cake layer is formed on the 
membrane surface which resulting the best permeate flux will be decreased. Table 2.3 
shows important reports about the importance of cake layer formation on membrane 
fouling in different types of feed water.

The particles are able to enter the membrane pores and associate together in the 
membrane pores by adsorption, which is the significant cause of the rigorous flux 
decline and blockage of membrane (Lin et al., 2009). Bae and Tak (2005) also 
relieved that solutes are easily and directly deposited onto the pore walls by 
adsorption without any protective effects of the cake layer on the membrane. 
 
   
Figure 2.4  Membrane pore blocking (Lin et al., 2009) 
 
2.2.3 Biofouling 
Biofouling is defined as the deposition, growth and metabolism of bacteria cells on 
the membrane which increase the flux decline during the filtration process (Pang et al., 
2005). Biofouling is easy to be found in all circumstances in the liquid solution based 
by the accumulation of bacteria, microorganisms and cells. Biofouling is the major 
problem occurred on the low pressure membranes (ultrafiltration and microfiltration) 
because the foulants are found larger than the membrane pore size results the biocake 
layer are formed easily on the membrane. Basically a biofilm can occur on all kind of 
surfaces due to the fact that the bacteria in the wastewaters have developed elaborate 
adhesion mechanisms. RO and NF processes were found to have more biofouling 
problem due to their low flux and limited membrane cleaning options (Flemming et 
al., 1997; Flemming, 1997). Numerous studies (Flemming et al., 1997; Liao et al., 
2004; Ramesh et al., 2007) suggest that EPS and SMP which secreted naturally inside 
and outside the cell surface by bacteria also play important roles in the formation of 
biological foulants and cake layer on the membrane surface.

pore sizes since they can easily adhere to and enter the membrane pore (Drew et al., 
2008). 
 
2.2.5 Inorganic Fouling 
Inorganic fouling is defined the fouling was contributed by the inorganic elements 
such as Mg, Al, Fe, Ca, Si and etc. (Wang et al., 2008) and inorganic fouling can be 
formed by chemical precipitation and biological precipitation. Typically, 
over-saturation is a major concern in reverse osmosis and nanofiltraton operation 
(Barker, 2004).  In general, fouling of MBR is mainly governed by biofouling and 
organic fouling because many researchers attributed that the membrane fouling 
especially in MBR is contributed by bacteria cells and biopolymers. However, Lyko et 
al. (2007) found that the metal substance was more significant foulant agent than 
biopolymers in the full-scale MBR treatment plant. This can be explained and 
supported that the inorganic fouling is more easily happened on the inorganic 
membrane (Kang et al., 2002). During the membrane cleaning process, it was found 
that the inorganic fouling is hard to be cleaned by chemical cleaning (You et al., 2006) 
because the organic foulants coupled with inorganic foulants will enhance the cake 
layer formation and resulted irreversible fouling occurred (Kang et al., 2002). 
 
2.3 Foulants Identification in the membrane bioreactors 
2.3.1 The Composition of Activated Sludge 
In the MBRs, the composition of the activated sludge in a biological wastewater 
treatment is very complicated because it consists a lot of bio-flocs, microorganisms, 
protozoa, cell fragments, synthetic organic compounds (SOC) by the consumers, 
disinfection by-products (DBP), soluble microbial products (SMP) produced by 
microorganisms in the biological phase and etc. (Chudoba et al., 1986; Rittmann et al., 
 21 
 
2.3.2 Particulates 
The particulates in the activated sludge are mostly flocs containing bacterial cells as 
well as inorganic and organic particles. Biopolymers such as extracellular polymeric 
substances (EPS) are excreted and decayed by biomass and “glue” individual bacterial 
cells together (Bitton, 1999). The particle size distribution (PSD) of the bio-flocs in 
activated sludge process is from approximately 1 µm up to 500-100 µm. However, 
several studies found out the MBR sludge flocs are generally smaller than the CAS

2.3.4 Extracellular Polymeric Substances   
MBR has been widely used in treating wastewater but due to biological treatment 
process (ASP) is needed to treat the wastewater influent, therefore extracellular 
polymeric substances (EPS) is found to be the main fouling for membrane fouling. 
EPS are defined as the construction materials for microbial aggregates such as 
biofilms, flocs and activated sludge liquors. EPS can be divided into bound EPS and 
soluble EPS. In other words, soluble EPS is classified as SMP from microbial growth 
and decay, as well as from dissolution of bound EPS (Ramesh et al., 2006; Ng et al., 
2010; Ng et al., 2011). EPS and/or SMP consist of polysaccharides, proteins, lipids, 
humic acids and nucleic acids (Guibaud et al., 2008; Li et al., 2008; Le-Clech et al., 
2006); there are lysis and hydrolysis products secreted by bacteria inside and outside 
the cell surface (Nielsen et al., 1997).  
 
In general, the solution containing EPS is then characterized by its relative content of 
protein (EPSp) and carbohydrate (EPSc) whereas EPSp has generally a hydrophobic 
tendency; EPSc is more hydrophilic (Liu and Fang, 2002). The EPS will form highly 
hydrated gel matrix and causes the membrane fouling because the EPS and SMP can 
be accumulated in mixed liquor which might increase the viscosity in the wastewater 
and also accumulated in membrane which create biofilm layer on the membrane 
surface (Neilson et al., 1997). In addition, the formation of membrane bio-fouling 
caused by SMP and EPS secreted by bacteria resulted in increase of membrane 
internal and external pore blocking and cake layers on membrane surfaces as well as 
flux decline (Ramesh et al., 2006; Yamato et al., 2006; Meng et al., 2009).  
 
Bound EPS have been reported as one of the major foulants in MBR system because 
of high concentration MLSS (Le-Clech et al., 2006). Numerous studies have

2.3.5 Soluble Microbial Products  
In fact, fouling behavior cannot be attributed solely to bound EPS due to the complex 
nature of sludge suspension. According to a detailed review by Meng et al. (2009), 
there has been an increase in the awareness on the role of SMP in membrane fouling 
as SMP is easily accumulated in the membrane and is even able to penetrate into the 
membrane pores. Several researches on this subject (Jarusutthirak and Amy, 2006; 
Yamato et al., 2006; Meng et al., 2009) have indicated that the soluble fraction of 
SMP plays a momentous role in membrane fouling especially in membrane 
bioreactors and in treating secondary wastewater effluent. Found in most biologically 
treated effluents, SMP contributes significantly to soluble organic matter and COD of 
the effluent (Barker and Stuckey, 1999; Zhou et al., 2009). 
 
SMP are defined as soluble EPS or soluble cellular components that are secreted 
during the cell lysis and hydrolysis product by bacteria (Li et al., 2005) and SMP can 
be defined as the pool of organic compounds that are released into solution from 
substrate metabolism and biomass decay. During the membrane filtration process, 
SMP adhere on the membrane surface, increase the internal and external pore 
blocking of the membrane and even form a cake layers on the membrane surface

2.3.6 Polysaccharides and Proteins 
Polysaccharides and proteins are usually found as major EPS components; meanwhile, 
polysaccharide concentrations were the main fouling agent in membranes of larger 
pore sizes since they can easily adhere to and enter the membrane pore (Drews et al., 
2008). It was also pointed out that the concentration of polysaccharides steadily 
decreased with the increase of SRT from 20 days to 30 days. Studies conducted by 
Dignac et al. (1998) and Frølund et al. (1995) indicated that proteins might be the 
main components of EPS in the wastewater treatment reactor whereas Li and 
co-workers (2008) have pointed out that the main component of EPS in membrane 
fouling is polysaccharides. Clearly, such conflicting results (Table 2.7 and Table 2.8) 
can only deepen the controversy and In addition, polysaccharide-like and protein-like 
substances are found predominant in EPS and/or SMP (Rosenberger et al., 2006; 
Le-Clech et al., 2003; FrØlund et al., 1995; Malamis and Andreadakis, 2009), though 
the species of these substances have not been well defined. As reported by

major impact of the operating parameter on membrane and MBR fouling which 
resulting the SRT must be considered very carefully in order to minimize the fouling 
of membrane. Liang et al. (2007) showed that the available EPS concentrations were 
relatively higher at low SRT, which reduced the permeate flux and increased fouling. 
With the purpose of finding out the role of SRT in membrane fouling, Zhang et al. 
(2006) operated a submerged MBR system with two different SRT (10 days and 30 
days) and the results showed SRT with 10 days has higher concentrations of soluble 
polysaccharide than 30 days which having a higher negative impact on membrane 
performance. A recent investigation (Malamis and Andreadakis., 2009) also 
established that the EPS concentration decreased when the SRT was increased 
because some bacteria underwent microbial cell lysis and aging. Further 
investigations relate the relationship between SRT and EPS as shown in Table 2.9.   
 
Therefore, lower fouling during the longer SRT is explained by lower organic carbon 
concentration in EPS. The theory can be supported by Nuengjamnong et al. (2005) 
because they conducted that the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the supernatant 
solution is independent of SRT. In overall, it is difficult to operate the MBR system in 
a different SRT to obtain an optimum SRT value, therefore, the optimal SRT should 
be in between of high fouling tendency of very low SRT operation and high viscosity 
suspension for very long SRT. In order to achieve a better SRT for membrane and 
MBR system, criteria such as designed rate of sludge and MLSS concentration 
recommended by the membrane supplier is more prone to define the working SRT.

2.4.2 Hydraulic Retention Time  
Previous studies have shown that hydraulic retention time (HRT) and SRT are 
important parameters in MBR operations (Le-Clech et al., 2006; Sun et al., 2006; 
Meng et al., 2009). Fallah et al. (2010) reported that low HRT resulted in high organic 
loading that adversely impacted remove efficiency in the membrane bio-reactor 
system. Ren et al. (2005) investigated the influence of HRT on organic pollutant 
removal and identified the optimum HRT and MLSS conditions for the membrane 
bio-reactor system. Using immobilized biological processes, researchers have applied 
various HRT conditions for the simultaneous removal of organic carbon and nitrogen. 
Yang et al. (2003) reported 95% removal of total organic carbon with HRT > 6.7 h. 
Kim and Yang (2004) found HRT >4 h being necessary for >80% removal of total 
nitrogen. A lower HRT value can induce a higher organic loading rate (OLR), which 
is correlated to the removal efficiency in the MBR systems (Fallah et al., 2010). Chae 
et al. (2006) reported that when the HRT decreases from 10 to 4 h, the EPS 
concentration increases and the membrane resistance is accelerated. Cho et al. (2005) 
reported that a short HRT and a high flux condition can result in hastening membrane 
fouling. Fallah et al. (2010) compared MBRs with HRTs of 18 h and 24 h respectively 
in removing styrene from synthetic wastewater and found that the SMP concentration 
 35 
 
the operating costs and also damages the membrane. Therefore, membrane cleaning is 
a necessary method to remove the foulants from the pore of membrane and also the 
surface of membrane. Membrane fouling is more pronounced in MF and UF systems 
due to its feed characteristics. In the membrane applications, there are many common 
types of cleaning methods such as relaxation, forward flushing, backwashing and 
chemical cleaning. 
 
a) Relaxation 
Relaxation refers to the periodical stop of the membrane filtration process such as 
30-60 seconds stops in every 10 minutes filtration. This is because the deposit 
foulants could be removed in the “relaxed” condition. During the relaxation, the 
foulants from the membrane surface will under a concentration gradient that could 
enhance the cleaning by air scouring. Several researches reported that relaxation 
may not be economically for operation of large-scale MBRs, but it is almost 
ubiquitous in modern full-scale MBRs because there is no consumption of water 
production and easy implementation in the MBRs system. 
 
b) Forward Flushing 
Forward flushing refers to the high cross-flow velocity along the membrane 
surface to remove the foulants. When the forward flushing is applied, the 
membranes will be flushed with the feed water or permeate forward that the 
flushing may results turbulence to release or discharge the particles or foulants 
that are absorbed to the membrane. A high hydraulic pressure gradient is needed 
during forward flushing of membrane. 
 
c) Backwashing 
 37 
 
backwash to remove the foulant away from the membrane. It was found that most of 
the dissolved organics in the wastewater are degraded by microbiological processes 
(Frølund et al., 1995). Several studies (Leiknes et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2006; Artiga et 
al., 2005; Ivanovic et al., 2006) have studied moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) 
coupled with membrane as an alternative to the CMBR because the MBBR has an 
excellent capability to remove soluble organic matter, handle high loads of particles 
and has a lower membrane fouling rate. All these reactors were operated at various 
SRT such as 10 d (Lee et al., 2006), 1 to 50 d (Artiga et al., 2005) and 60 d (Yang et 
al., 2009). However, Yang et al. (2009) concluded that the moving bed membrane 
bioreactor (MBMBR) yielded two times more effluent suspended solids and had a 
membrane fouling rate about three times higher than the CMBR. The protein and 
polysaccharide concentrations of soluble EPS in the MBMBR were apparently found 
to be higher than in the CMBR. Further. Yang et al (2009) also postulated that this 
could be caused by a large quantity of EPS and filamentous bacteria prevailing in the 
suspended solids in the MBMBR 
. 
2.4.5.2 Bio-Entrapped Reactor and Bio-Entrapped Membrane Reactor 
The bio-entrapped reactor (BER) was developed for the treatment for various water 
and wastewaters in order to achieve high simultaneous removal of carbon and 
nitrogen within a single through-put process (Yang et al., 1997; Yang et al., 2002; 
Yang et al., 2003). Due to the high levels of ammonia and nitrogen in the wastewater, 
BER was developed to achieve the high removal efficiency of ammonia and nitrogen 
to reduce the risk to animal and human life. The BER has similar processing methods 
to cell immobilized technique that to encounter many types of wastewater in treating 
the organic matter, and has a great impact on the nitrification process which resulted 
the enhancement of nitrification performance and improvements the water quality. 
 39 
 
reached nearly 90%. Besides, the hydraulic retention time (HRT) was operated in 9 
hours, 18 hours and 24 hours, it was found that the removal efficiency for total 
nitrogen was 69% + 13 and 89% + 7 for agricultural wastewater and domestic 
wastewater, respectively. Consequently, BER was verified to be effective on 
simultaneous organic matters especially nitrogen removal and has great potential for 
further wastewater treatment application development.

The synthetic wastewater from the influent reservoir was supplied from the bottom of 
the reactors by a peristaltic pump. Air was supplied from the bottom of the reactor and 
the air flow was controlled by a flow meter. The effluent flowed from the top of the 
reactor and collected in the effluent reservoir. Both reactors were maintained at a HRT 
of 12 hours and the reactors were operated at room temperature (25 ± 3°C).

L-Tyrosine at different concentrations and no backwashing were employed for the 
glucose and L-Tyrosine. Filtration tests were performed in cross-flow mode with a 
cross-flow velocity of 0.30 m/s. The feed solution passed through the membrane 
installed on the membrane system and permeate was collected on the outside of 
membrane system, a tank which connected to the digital electronic weight to measure 
the membrane filtration flux at time intervals.

modules were installed into the reactors. The MLSS concentration in the CMBR was

The synthetic wastewater with chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 300 mg/L was

sucrose wastewater was selected in order to prevent any fluctuations in the feed and to 
supply a continuous source of completely biodegradable organic pollutants to each 
reactor. The composition of the synthetic wastewater is given in Table 3.5.

3.3.5.2 Feed Water to the Ultrafiltration Membrane System 
The effluents (unfiltered and filtered effluents) from BER and ASP were used as the 
membrane feed water. Unfiltered effluent was directly taken from both reactors and 
the filtered effluent was performed by using 1 µm filter paper to remove the role of 
suspended solids in membrane fouling study. Moreover, commercial glucose (Nacalai 
Tesque) with molecular weight of 180.2 g/mol and L-Tyrosine (SIGMA-ALDRICH) 
with molecular weight of 181.2 g/mol was employed in the present experiments. 0.1 
gram of glucose and L-Tyrosine were diluted with 1 L deionized water and the final 
 59 
 
changes in HRT could significantly impact membrane fouling. The data was collected 
after 14 days of operation at each HRT to ensure establishment of the steady state in 
the MBRs. Once the transmembrane pressure exceeded the maximum operating 
pressure, i.e. 55 kPa, the membrane modules were removed for chemical cleaning. 
Chemical cleaning was performed by soaking the membrane in a solution of sodium 
hypochlorite (NaOCl) for 30 min. After cleaning the membrane was tested by 
compressing air into the hollow fibers in a tank filled with distilled water; the member 
was then reinstalled or replaced when air bubbles were observed.  
 
In Experiment II, the two MBRs (BEMR and CMBR) were operated at the optimum 
HRT of 12 h while maintaining an average flux of 20 L/m2.h, the performance of the 
membranes was examined periodically after brief operations. Membrane conditions 
after 15 min of suction and 1 min of backwash, after 30 min of suction and 1 min of 
backwash, and after backwashing of a fouled membrane at the flow velocity of 0.1 
m/s were compared.  In Experiment III, both MBRs were operated at the flux of 20 
L/m2.h with 15 min of suction and 1 min of backwash. Experiment III was carried out 
to determine the service duration that the MBRs could be continually operated before 
the TMP threshold of 55 kPa was reached when chemical cleaning became necessary.  
 
3.3.7 Gel Filtration Chromatography  
The filtered effluents from BEMR and CMBR were fractionated into four groups, i.e., 
G-1 (>100 kDa), G-2 (10-100 kDa), G-3 (1-10 kDa) and G-4 (<1 kDa), according to 
their apparent molecular weights (AMW) by using the fraction collectors and gel 
filtration chromatography (GFC). Sephadex G-100 (Pharmacia) was used as a packing 
material. The chemical polyethylene glycol (PEG) was selected for the calibration of 
AMWs of 0.2, 1, 6, 35, 100 kDa respectively. Blue dextran (Pharmacia) was applied

The filtrate thus contained the total SMP contents (total protein and total carbohydrate) 
in the MBRs. The SMP were then fractionated according to their apparent molecular 
weights (AMW) by gel filtration chromatography (GFC). The total SMP and all GFC 
fractions were analyzed for their total protein and total carbohydrate contents, which 
were regarded as the most important parts of SMP materials. The total protein content 
was determined using the modified Lowry method with bovine serum albumin (BSA) 
as the protein standard (Lowry et al., 1951; FrØlund et al., 1995; Liang et al., 2007), 
and the total carbohydrate content was determined using the modified Anthrone 
method with glucose as the standard (Raunkjaer et al., 1994; FrØlund et al., 1995).

3.4.3.2 Total Proteins Analysis  
Lowry method determined protein concentrations lies in the reactivity of the peptide 
nitrogen with the copper ions under alkaline conditions and the subsequent reduction 
of the Folin-Ciocalteay phosphomolybdicphosphotungstic acid to 
heteropolymolybdenum blue by the copper-catalyzed oxidation of aromatic acids. The 
Lowry method is sensitive to pH changes and therefore the pH of assay solution 
should be maintained at 10 - 10.5. Bouvine serum albumin (BSA) was used as the 
standard and five type of reagents were prepared; Reagent 1: 2% Na2CO3 in 0.1 N 
NaOH, reagent 2: 1% NaK Tartrate in H2O, reagent 3: 0.5% CuSO4.5H2O in H2O, 
reagent 4: 48 mL of reagent A, 1 mL of reagent B, 1 mL of reagent C, reagent 5: 
Phenol Reagent – 2 N Folin-Phenol: distilled water with ratio 1: 1. Afterwards, 0.2 
mL of dilute Folin-phenol solution to each tube and incubated at room temperature 30 
min for absorbance at 750 nm (FrØlund et al., 1995; Lowry et al., 1952). The

CHAPTER 4 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
This chapter presents the results that have been grouped into four sections. The first 
section presents the results of water quality removal efficiency of both biological 
reactors (BER and ASP) by the synthetic wastewater and the membrane performance 
by the effluents from BER and ASP in the membrane fouling. These two sections 
investigate the use of BER for the following experiments in order to couple with 
membrane to develop a novel membrane bioreactor. The third section presents the 
performance of membrane bioreactor (BEMR and CMBR) in treating the food and 
beverage processing wastewater in various HRTs and the membrane fouling behavior. 
The characteristics of SMP, i.e., molecular weight distribution and chemical 
components of SMP, are also presented 
 
4.1 Removal Efficiency of BER and ASP 
The BER and the ASP achieved COD removal efficiencies ranging from of 94% to 
99% and 91% to 95%, respectively by the synthetic wastewater. The influent COD for 
both biological reactors was maintained at 300 mg/L. The suspended solids produced 
from the BER and the ASP ranged 8 mg/L-15 mg/L and 20 mg/L-30 mg/L, 
respectively. The BER showed an excellent soluble organic matter removal and also 
less production of suspended solids. The results are shown in Table 4.1. After COD 
removal efficiency of >90% was achieved, the effluent was then collected and used 
for further membrane fouling studies. The membrane system that was discussed 
previously was in a good working condition because the effluent from the membrane 
system was free of suspended solids.

In the case of filtered effluents from BER and ASP as shown in Fig. 4.1b, assuming 
that there were no suspended solids in the membrane feed, it is apparent that the BER 
achieved a trend similar to its unfiltered effluent and it accomplished a permeate flux 
of 25%-30% higher than ASP at steady state. This can be attributed to less SMP in the

The effect of the cleaning procedure that has been performed on the fouled

4.3.2 Ammonia Nitrogen and Nitrate Removal  
The influent and effluent NH4+-N and NO-3-N are shown in Table 4.2, respectively. 
The BEMR and CMBR removed 88.6%-97.6% and 83.1%-97.6% of NH4+-N, 
respectively from the wastewater at the studied HRT (12 h) thus indicated that the 
BEMR and CMBR could provide satisfactory ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency. 
This is because the microorganisms were highly capable of degrading excess organic 
matters in the food wastewater. However, it was found that the BEMR has slightly 
higher removal rate (4%~5%) than the CMBR because the high DO in the BEMR 
under continuous aeration led to nitrification of NH4+-N (Zhu et al., 2010). The 
overall nitrogen removal in the BEMR was not only removed by nitrification and also 
by denitrification (Picot et al., 2009; Turan et al., 2011). The higher ammonia removal 
 79 
 
bound EPS will be released into the sludge flocs (Trussell et al., 2007). The BEMR 
sustained a longer period of operation before reaching the TMP of 55 kPa because the 
membrane was exposed to a much lower concentration of suspended solids (20-30 
mg/L) in the separate membrane compartment.

Figure 4.5  Effects of hydraulic retention time on trans-membrane pressure and 
membrane fouling of the BEMR and CMBR 
 
A long SRT in the BEMR allows development of slow-growing microorganisms 
(Ahmed et al., 2007) and specific microorganisms that could assimilate dead or 
inactive microorganisms (Han et al., 2005). Ahmed et al. (2007) also reported less 
membrane fouling with increasing SRT from 20 to 100 d. Besides, bacteria were 
found widely present on fouled membrane (Ng et al., 2006); the growth of bacteria on 
membrane that resulted in formation of foulants and biocake on the membrane 
 81 
 
service cycles; whereas with the cycle of 30-min filtration plus 1-min backwash, the 
TMP reached 23 kPa at the end (Fig. 4.12a and 4.12b). In contrast, the TMP of BEMR 
started at 2.4 kPa at the beginning of service and was stable after backwashing of each 
cycle; it increased much more gradually and slowly reaching 3.9 kPa and 6.2 kPa at 
the ends of 10 service cycles with 15 and 30 filtration durations, respectively. As the 
operation time increased, more colloids and SMPs with different MW particles 
accumulated on the membrane that made it increasingly difficult to remove by 
backwashing. 
 
The BEMR produced less SMP and displayed less fouling than did the CMBR. SMP 
<100 kDa and protein that were more obstructive to membrane pores were less in the 
BEMR than in the CMBR. This was consistent with our previous findings on the 
positive effects of membrane fouling by proteins of low molecular weights.  The 
protein likely narrowed membrane pores via adsorption, and fouling was exacerbated 
by denatured protein (Ng et al., 2010). With backwashing, the membrane process of 
BEMR could sustain a longer operation period at a higher permeate flux than could 
the CMBR.  Operation duration and frequency of backwashing are central design 
parameters of MBRs. Jiang et al. (2005) found that an MBR using a 600-second 
membrane filtration process with 45-second backwashing was more efficient than one 
using a 2000-second membrane filtration process with 45-second backwashing. 
Therefore, to reduce fouling for the CMBR at an average flux of 20 L/m2.h, it is 
conceivable that operating with 15-min suction and 1-min backwash can be less 
fouling than with 30-min suction and 1-min backwash. The operation protocol may be 
varied to achieve a longer service run with a nominal backwashing interval.

that external, physical cleaning was necessary because the consolidated cake could 
not be removed by back-flush cycles. Fallah et al. (2010) also reported that fouling by 
pore blocking could only be eliminated by chemical cleaning.  
 
In the BEMR, TMP was below 10 kPa for 10 days; it gradually increased till day 29 
and then increased at a faster rate reaching 55 kPa at 39 days (Fig. 7 (b)). The increase 
of TMP was attributed to colloids and soluble EPS being deposited on the membrane. 
The operation time of the BEMR before chemical cleaning was needed was 7 times 
longer than that of the CMBR. This was attributed to less MLSS and less total SMP in 
the BEMR. Based on these results, BEMR appears to be less susceptible to membrane 
fouling due to reduced SMP and MLSS contents and therefore requires less-frequent 
cleaning.

calibration was obtained as shown in Figure 3.17 (R = 0.95). 
 
The total SMP, in terms of protein and carbohydrate concentrations for the ASP and 
the BER effluents by fractionation, were calculated to be 28.85 mg/L and 8.40 mg/L, 
respectively. The total SMP level from the BER was considerably lower than that 
from ASP by approximately 71%. This decrease is attributed to the increase of SRT 
(Malamis and Andreadakis, 2009; Meng et al., 2009; Rosenberger et al., 2006; Liang 
et al., 2007) in the BER. Besides the longer SRT, the completely-mixed environment 
and higher DO in the BER ensure a good contact between the bio-balls and the 
supplied nutrients. Furthermore, the inner and outer microbial environments of the 
bio-balls were relatively active. This was achieved by monitoring the air flow rates 
which in turn encouraged proper mixing and constant supply of nutrients to the micro 
flora. Therefore it may possibly reduce the chances of cell death and subsequently 
contribute to lower SMP concentrations (Jang et al., 2006).  
 
The SMP fractionation of SMPP of both reactor effluents is shown in Fig. 4.8a. This 
clearly indicates that ASP has higher SMPp concentrations than the BER in each 
fraction and the smallest fraction (G-4) contained the highest amount of protein 
concentrations in four fractions. These results with the presence of higher 
concentrations of SMPP in the smaller fraction are comparable to the results of 
Malamis and Andreadakis. (2009) in which the smallest fraction represented more 
than 50%. The lower SMPp concentrations in the BER showed the effectiveness of 
this biological process, which reduced the dominating fractions significantly. The 
BER contributed 1.20 (G-4), 0.89 (G-3), 1.09 (G-2) and 0.95 (G-1) concentrations of 
protein respectively in each fraction, while 7.13 (G-4), 4.13 (G-3), 5.44 (G-2) and 
1.69 (G-1) were found in the ASP. The results indicated that the ASP has 77.5%

Fig. 4.9 and Fig. 4.10 illustrate the SMPc (total carbohydrate) and SMPp (total protein) 
contents of the two MBRs at different HRTs. The total SMP (SMPc + SMPp) was also 
calculated. The CMBR produced more SMP than the BEMR by 33%, 41%, and 28% 
at HRT of 6, 9, and 12 h, respectively. In both MBRs, the SMP contents with the HRT 
of 6 h were higher than those with HRTs of 9 and 12 h. The total SMP contents in 
BEMR and in CMBR increased from 27 to 45 mg/L and from 37 to 68 mg/L, 
respectively, when the HRT decreased from 12 to 6 h.  At lower HRTs, a larger 
amount of SMP could be released by the abundant filamentous organisms in the 
bioreactors during their stationary and endogenous metabolism stage that could 
adversely impact the membrane (Choi et al., 2002). Fallah et al. (2010) compared the 
removal of styrene from synthetic wastewater by MBRs with HRTs of 18 h and 24 h 
and found that the SMP concentration increased when HRT was reduced to 18 h.

The relationship between SRT and EPS and/or SMP has been previously studied 
relative to membrane fouling (Cho et al., 2005; Han et al., 2005; Liang et al., 2007). 
The bio-balls employed in the BEMR had longer SRT and good contact with supplied 
 93 
 
was the main component that caused pore blocking of the membrane. Therefore, 
higher DO and longer SRT in the BEMR led to less SMP and reduced membrane 
fouling. 
 
It is important to analyze the molecular fractions larger and smaller than 100 kDa in 
the BEMR and CMBR. The membrane (GE ZeeWeed-1) used in this study had a pore 
size of 0.036 μm approximating 100 kDa. At different HRTs, the total SMP contents 
(SMPp and SMPc) larger than 100 kDa in the BEMR were 15% to 23% while in the 
CMBR they were 17% to 22%. Lin et al. (2009) reported that particles of smaller 
molecular weight could easily penetrate the membrane pores by adsorption in a 
100-kDa membrane. Therefore, the major fouling mechanism by SMP (more than 
70%) is likely caused by pore blocking, rather than by the formation of cake layer on 
the membrane surface.  
 
4.5 Effect of Protein and Carbohydrate on Membrane Fouling 
Since the major foulant of SMP such as carbohydrate and protein to the membrane 
fouling is not well-defined yet, and conflicting results were found in several 
researches that pointed polysaccharide-like and protein-like substances are found 
predominant in EPS and/or SMP (Rosenberger et al., 2006; Le-Clech et al., 2003; 
FrØlund et al., 1995; Malamis and Andreadakis, 2009), but Li et al. (2008) found that 
the main components in membrane fouling is polysaccharides. Therefore, a membrane 
filtration test was presented that commercial glucose (Nacalai Tesque) with molecular 
weight of 180.2 g/mol represented as carbohydrate and L-Tyrosine 
(SIGMA-ALDRICH) with molecular weight of 181.2 g/mol represented as protein 
was employed.

CHAPTER 5 
CONCLUSIONS AND SUGGESTIONS 
 
5.1 Conclusions 
1. A BER with a longer SRT has demonstrated that membrane filtration performed 
well and achieved an approximately 25%-30% higher filtration flux and better 
flux recovery after backwashing than the ASP system. 
2. In both MBRs (BEMR and CMBR), TMP arose faster as HRT decreased. The BEMR 
was less susceptible to fouling, and it sustained longer service duration than did the 
CMBR (39 days vs. 5 days).  
3. The MBRs tend to accumulate a high concentration of SMP that are colloidal and 
refractory in biological treatment processes, and SMP has an significant impact 
on the membrane fouling that SMP is found to play an important role and 
responsible for membrane fouling during membrane filtration o, while suspended 
solids and bound EPS have a rather negligible impact on membrane fouling. 
4. The BEMR produced less SMP than did CMBR (34%-48% less protein and 
16%-29% less carbohydrate) due to slow-growing microorganisms with long 
SRT in the new bioreactor. The BEMR appears promising in controlling 
membrane fouling, requiring less frequent chemical cleaning, and being more 
economical to operate 
5. Both MBRs produced SMP of 10-100 kDa primarily of protein (59% in BEMR and 64% 
in CMBR), which likely caused membrane pores clogging. 
6. Protein is most likely to be found in both reactors and the main foulant to cause 
pore blocking rather than carbohydrate.

一、參加會議經過 
 This XII International Symposium on Environmental Geotechnology, Energy and Global 
Sustainable Development was hold by International Society for Environmental Geotechnology.  
This year the conference was organized by California State University at Los Angeles (CSULA). 
There are already 11 conferences held by International Society for Environmental 
Geotechnology in USA, China, Hong Kong, Germany, Nigeria, Japan, South Korea, Brazil, 
Slovenia etc.  ISEG is a small society which is operated by university professors in turn.  
However, ISEG has held 12 conferences in the past that indicates ISEG is getting more 
recognized in this academic field.  The XII ISEG conference was held by CSULA professor 
professor Gustavo Borel Menezes in CSULA campus from June 27 -29, 2012. The conference 
venue was at Golden Eagle Building.  The registered people were about 400.  As the society’s 
title shows, any topics relate to environment, geotechnology, energy and sustainable 
development were welcome to join this conference.   I met two Germany researchers who 
presented the warning system for land sliding.  These two young researchers visited Taiwan 
before.  
二、與會心得 
 This is a very unique conference I have ever attended so far.  The conference provided no 
oral presentation but open group discussion and poster presentations.  In three days’ conference 
time, the sections were designed as keynote speech in the beginning, open round table discussion,

Introduction 
As human population continues to increase and economies prosper, the demand on clean 
water resources are expected to rise tremendously in the upcoming decades. The water recycling and 
water reclamation are the solutions to ensure the sufficient supply of reliable water for public use. 
However, water reclamation practices are still very limited in Taiwan and mainly only operating in 
small or medium-scale process. Additionally, the domestic regulatory systems are not completed yet, 
and the core-thrust of the current legislation is focusing on waste reduction but not on the aspect of 
recycling water for secondary usages. Therefore, the development of wastewater recycling and reuse 
is a subject worthy of further exploration.  
Numerous studies have demonstrated membrane technology to easily remove natural organic 
matter (NOM), inorganic compounds and microorganisms from raw wastewater (Cho et al., 1999; 
Le-Clech et al., 2006), which makes it ideal for water reclamation application. Currently, direct 
filtration of secondary effluent from wastewater treatment plant with membrane technology such as 
microfiltration (MF), ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) are 
increasingly gaining attention worldwide for the purpose of wastewater recycling (Meng et al., 2009; 
Synder et al., 2007). However, membrane fouling has remained as the main challenge that negatively 
affecting the efficient operation of membrane system, which in turn to increase the operation costs of 
highly priced membrane system (Le-Clech et al., 2006). Several researchers (Le-Clech et al., 2006; 
Meng et al., 2009) indicated that the backwashing is an effective physical cleaning method to remove 
the membrane fouling cause by suspended particles but not easily to remove the fouling caused by 
irreversible blocking, which often requires a chemical reagents to improve the fouling removal 
efficiency and membrane recovery. 
Several different pre-treatment methods have been tested for their ability to reduce membrane 
fouling, which would increase the membrane lifetime and thus decrease the operating costs (Baek 
and Chang, 2009; Shon et al., 2004). Shon et al. (2004) studied MF, UF and RO with different 
physical and chemical pre-treatments and concluded that MF and UF mainly remove suspended 
solids from the water, while PAC must be added to ensure RO has sufficient filtration performance. 
Therefore, a good operation and maintenance performance to run the membrane would dramatically 
reduce the cost of reclaimed water production. For that reason, this study investigates the importance 
of pre-treatment techniques for the use of hollow fiber UF and plate sheet MF prior to reverse 
osmosis (RO) to find out the best operation scenario for water reclamation from municipal 
wastewater effluent. 
Methodology Protocols 
All membrane filtration experiments were performed and operated in lab-scale. Table 1 
summarizes the membrane specifications for low-pressure membranes (MF and UF) and 
high-pressure membrane (RO) in this experiment.  
increased to 280% (5.4 kPa to 20.5 kPa) after 17 h filtration without the FF while the TMP was 
increased to 58% with FF as pre-treatment. Clearly, FF ais capable of partially removing suspended 
matters and colloid particles in the wastewater, which considerably extended the operating life of 
UF/MF by delaying membrane fouling frequency.

Figure 2 depicts the decrease of RO permeation with and without the MF/UF as the 
pre-treatment under two different operating fluxes (10 and 20 LMH). The permeation of RO was 
reduced very quickly (0.02 normalized flux) in less than 5 h operation. The initial normalized flux 
when MF was the pretreatment for RO at constant flux 10 LMH, initial normalized flux was 
recorded at 0.042 m/hr/MPa and decreased to 0.01 after 33 h of operation; while UF was the 
pretreatment, initial normalized flux was recorded at 0.037 m/hr/MPa and decreased to 0.031 
m/hr/MPa. UF appears to offer twice the normalized flux after 33 h of operation before cleaning in 
place (CIP).

Summaries 
In this study, various pre-treatment processes (1 µm FF, IE resin, polymer and GAC) and 
membranes (MF, UF and RO) were experimented and compared to determine the optimal operation 
for water reclamation from municipal wastewater effluent. FF was found to be highly effective in 
reducing the particles in the secondary effluent. TMP of UF and MF increased slowly (58%) with the 
FF. UF membrane has demonstrated to be a very promising pre-treatment in terms of controlling and 
reducing RO fouling than MF which requires less frequent chemical cleaning and thus extended the 
membrane operating cycle. Therefore, the results in this study provided several additional data on 
good criterion for selecting pre-treatment methods for the future membrane analysis to reduce the 
fouling of membrane.
