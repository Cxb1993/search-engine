2. Abstract 
 A simple mathematical formula is proposed for computing the coupling coefficient between two arbitrary 
antennas that are placed within the other’s near-field region. The information required by this expression 
consists of the associated normalized vector far-field patterns, their relative orientations, and the antenna 
spacing. To validate our proposed expression, coupling coefficients in several near-field scenarios are 
computed, including for the case of a practical near-field ultra-high frequency (UHF) radio-frequency 
identification (RFID) system. These results are then compared to practical measurements and to the outcome 
of full-wave simulations generated using Ansoft HFSS. All results are in good agreement. Additionally, in this 
project, it is shown that several factors may influence the coupling coefficient, such as the impedance 
matching of the receiving antenna and the directivities of both antennas. With the aid of our formula, the 
near-field read range can be determined and near-field coupling phenomena can be investigated. The results 
thus obtained may be useful in near-field communication systems. 
Keywords: Electromagnetic coupling, power transmission, RFID, UHF antennas.

antenna.
Section III, three typical communication scenarios are simulated
using Ansoft HFSS, and the results are compared with those
computed via the proposed method. In Section IV, a near-field
UHF RFID system is considered as an example. Results ob-
tained through the proposed formula, measurement, and HFSS
simulation are shown and compared. Finally, some observations
and design guidelines are summarized in Section V.
II. FORMULATION
Let us consider a receiving antenna placed in the near field
of a transmitting antenna as depicted in Fig. 1. The incident
and emergent waveguide mode coefficients for the transmitting
(receiving) antenna are and ( and ) respectively.
The coupling quotient between the transmitting and receiving
antennas is defined as [18]. This can be interpreted as
the signal coupled into the receiving antenna when a unit signal
is fed into the transmitting antenna. This, in turn, is identical
to the definition of the forward transmission coefficient of the
scattering parameters, namely , when the transmitting and
receiving antennas and the region in between are considered a
two-port network. Since we are more interested in the coupled
power level, is used instead. In this paper,
is expressed in decibels and is referred to as the power coupling
level or the coupling coefficient .
The coupling quotient between the transmitting and receiving
antennas can be expressed as [18]

where and are the
normalized vector far-field patterns for the receiving and trans-
mitting antennas, respectively.
is the propagation vector, and , where is
the free-space wavelength. is
the position vector of the receiving antenna with respect to the
transmitting antenna. is a mismatch constant defined as
(2)
where is the intrinsic impedance of free space, is the
characteristic impedance of the feed line of the receiving an-
tenna, and and are the reflection coefficients of the re-
ceiving antenna and its passive termination, respectively.
Note from (1) that the coupling quotient is a function of the
position vector . The double integral in (1) is computed over the
transverse components of propagation vector and , and
the inner product of the two vector far-field patterns in the in-
tegrand represents the interaction between the transmitting and
receiving antennas. The integral interval signifies that
only the propagating waves are considered, which corresponds
to the real part of complex power. The same assumption has
been made in the near-field measurement [18], which can be
considered as the reciprocal problem to the one discussed here.
In the near-field measurement, the far-field pattern of an antenna
under test (AUT) is obtained by measuring the near-field cou-
pling between the AUT and the probe antenna. In most situ-
ations, this probe antenna is placed in the radiating near field
of the AUT, and the induced tangential electrical fields on it
are measured [19]. The coupling measured in the radiating near
field is then converted into the far-field pattern of the AUT. Con-
versely, in our proposed method, the far-field patterns are con-
verted into the coupling in the radiating near field due to the fact
that in near-field communication systems the receiving antenna
is always placed in the radiating near field of the transmitting an-
tenna, and hence, beyond its reactive near field. The proposed
formula is thus applicable to the coupling coefficients between
antennas placed in the radiating near field of each other. In fact,
the evanescent part of the spectrum contributes mainly to the re-
active near fields but has only negligible effects on the coupling
in the radiating near field, and therefore, it can be neglected.
Applying the Laplacian operator to (1) yields
(3)
Rearranging (3), we obtain
(4)
which indicates that the coupling quotient satisfies the scalar
Helmholtz equation [20]. As a result, the coupling quotient can
be expressed as

functions of the first kind and the associated Legendre polyno-
mials, respectively, and is the spherical wave coefficient.
Here, the coupling quotient is expanded by a set of known basis

z-directed counterpart, and this can be denoted as

Substituting (9) and (10) into (8) yields the desired spher-
ical wave coefficients . The computed coefficient, , dimin-
ishes drastically for higher order terms , causing (7) to
rapidly converge. The near-field coupling coefficient as a func-
tion of normalized antenna spacing , computed by our pro-
posed method and that obtained via HFSS are shown in Fig. 3.
The results agree well with those obtained using our formula.
B. Side-by-Side, Polarization-Mismatched Half-Wave Dipoles
In the preceding subsection, the two dipoles were polariza-
tion-matched, which is the ideal case in a two-dipole system.
However, in most cases, the dipoles are arbitrarily oriented. To
further verify our formulation, we consider a scenario having
polarization-mismatched dipoles. In the current case, the re-
ceiving dipole lying on the y-z plane is rotated by 20 around its
phase center. This can be accounted for in our expression simply
by transforming accordingly the coordinate system of the vector
far-field pattern of the receiving dipole. thus obtained, sim-
ilarly diminishes drastically for leading to rapid conver-
gence of (7). The coupling coefficients obtained are plotted in
Fig. 4. One can see that the coupling coefficients are smaller
here than in the preceding case because of the polarization mis-
match between the two dipoles.
C. Polarization-Matched Square Loop and Half-Wave Dipole
We next use a square loop antenna with perimeter equal to a
wavelength to replace the transmitting dipole in Section III-A.
The loop antenna is centered at the origin with the loop lying
on the x-y plane, oriented such that the resultant polarization

ization-mismatched dipoles.
Fig. 5. Coupling coefficient versus normalized antenna separation for polar-
ization-matched square loop and dipole.
is aligned with the y-directed receiving dipole. The coupling
coefficient for this setup can thus be computed as a function of
the antenna spacing. The results are compared with those from
simulation in Fig. 5.
In the three scenarios, as mentioned above, the agreement be-
tween the computed results and those simulated by HFSS in-
dicates that the proposed method can be effectively utilized to
determine the near-field coupling coefficient if the relative ori-
entation, the antenna spacing, and the far-field patterns of the
transmitting and receiving antennas are known. Also, it must be
noted from (7) that the formula is theoretically applicable within
the radiating near field. As a result, the coupling coefficients
shown in Figs. 3 and 4 and Fig. 5, respectively, can be predicted
accurately for and , and ac-
curacy degrades outside that particular range. However, one can
also see that for being as small as , the formula is still
able to predict the coupling coefficient with satisfactory accu-
racy. Therefore, results are presented for regardless
of the constraints. It is also important to note that the differences
between the simulated results for different resonant frequencies

facilitate measuring the coupling coefficient through the vector
network analyzer (VNA), the antenna is designed for 50
instead of being conjugate matched to the highly capacitive tag
chips and is fed by a section of CPS connected to a balun. Due
to fabrication errors and uncertainty of the dielectric constant of
FR4, the resonant frequency of the prototype antenna slightly
shifts from the design frequency of 915 MHz to 920 MHz. The
peak gain measured at 920 MHz is 2.2 dBi.
The other design used is a meandered circular loop [26]. A
prototype antenna designed at 915 MHz is shown in Fig. 10. It
is also designed for 50 , and the same feeding structure is used
for easy measurement. Similarly, the resonant frequency of the
prototype antenna shifts to 930 MHz. The peak gain measured
at this frequency is 2.7 dBi.
C. Results
The aforementioned reader and tag antennas are utilized to
measure the coupling coefficient in the near-field UHF RFID
system. The schematic of the experimental setup is shown
in Fig. 11. The measurements are performed in an anechoic
chamber, and the associated coupling coefficients are ob-
tained by measuring at the antenna terminals using the
HP8753D VNA. Initially, the coupling coefficients are mea-
sured for various antenna separations, , and two sets of data
are acquired using the two tag antennas individually. During the
measurement, the reader antenna is fixed, while the tag antenna
is moved from to 400 mm with incremental steps
of 5 mm. The antennas are also kept polarization-matched with
the main beam maximum aimed at each other. A photograph
of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 12. The coupling
coefficients for the case where the folded dipole serves as tag
antenna are measured at 920 MHz, i.e. the resonant frequency
of the fabricated folded dipole. Results obtained by practical

measurement, and calculation from our formula, and from
full-wave simulation are plotted in Fig. 13. The agreement
between them is excellent. The same measurement procedure
is repeated, and the folded dipole is replaced by the meandered
circular loop. The experiment is conducted at 930 MHz, i.e.
the resonant frequency of the meandered circular loop. The
results obtained are plotted in Fig. 14. Again, a satisfactory
agreement can be observed among them, once more validating
our proposed formula and demonstrating its accuracy.
Following the same process, the coupling coefficient is also
investigated at frequencies other than the resonant frequency of
the tag antenna. The measurements are conducted individually
at 910, 920, 930, and 940 MHz, spanning only a small fraction of
the wide bandwidth of the reader antenna. The radiation perfor-
mance and input matching of the reader antenna remain nearly
the same throughout the frequency range. The coupling coef-
ficients measured and computed via the formula are compared
and plotted in Fig. 15. For off-resonance operation, the associ-
ated coupling coefficient decreases mainly due to the impedance
mismatch of the tag antenna. The more the operating frequency
deviates from resonance, the lower the coupling coefficient will
be.
Additional measurements are performed using the folded
dipole as the tag antenna and the meandered circular loop (pre-
viously used as the tag antenna) as the reader antenna. Fig. 16
shows the measured and computed coupling coefficients along
with those for the case where the proposed high-gain reader
antenna is used. The latter exhibits a higher coupling coefficient

the antennas are sampled with a step of 1 . This will inevitably
introduce some errors. Note from the figures that the maximal
coupling occurs at the on-axis point A, in contrast to the min-
imal coupling near the corners of the scanning area. However,
near the corners, the coupling coefficient slightly increases as
is increased because the angular offset from the on-axis point A.
Therefore, as can be observed from these figures, the spatial dis-
tribution of the coupling coefficient is more uniform for a larger
.
D. Near-Field Read Range
In near-field (UHF) RFID systems, it is desirable for tags to
be detectable within a specified read range and not beyond that.

 . (a) Calculated and (b) measured 3D surface plots.
With the aid of the proposed formula, it is fairly straightforward
to determine the read range for near-field RFID systems. We
rearrange (11) as (13)
(13)
where is the minimum threshold power necessary to power
up the tag chip provided by the chip vendors. For simplicity, it
is assumed that the reader circuitry (tag chip) and the antenna
are perfectly matched such that .
Given the output power of the reader circuitry, , and ,
one can find the corresponding read range from the curve of
coupling coefficient, , calculated using our proposed formula,
and considering the coupling coefficient as a function of an-
tenna separation for the particular reader and tag antennas used.
As an example, we consider one of the above scenarios where
the folded dipole is the tag antenna and the square loop array
with back reflector is the reader antenna. For a given
and , one can see from Fig. 13
that the corresponding read range for coupling coefficient
equals 300 mm. This information implies that an output
power greater than 10 dBm may enable the reader to detect the
tags outside the read range in addition to those that lie within it.
V. CONCLUSION
A simple formulation has been proposed in this paper for
computing the coupling coefficient between two antennas
that are arbitrarily oriented and placed in the near field of
each other. The formula, in a sense, can be regarded as a
near-field counterpart of the Friis transmission formula. It has
been validated by considering three typical scenarios, and the
results have been shown to agree well with those obtained from
simulation. In addition, an experimental setup for a near-field
UHF RFID system has been designed and implemented. The
coupling coefficients obtained via our formula, experimental
measurement, and HFSS simulation are all in good agreement.
Additionally, some factors critical to the coupling coefficient
have been identified, including impedance matching of the
receiving antenna, directivities and relative orientation of the
transmitting and receiving antennas. Another advantage of
our formula is that the computation time is greatly reduced
as compared to full-wave simulation. It is believed that the
proposed formula may prove useful for design and optimization
of near-field communication systems.

where f0 and Δf represent the resonant frequency and the 3-dB 
bandwidth of the input or output resonator. Mij represents the 
coupling coefficient between resonators i and j, and fp1 and fp2 
are the lower and upper split resonant frequencies for the 
coupled resonator pair. The geometric parameters of the 
prototype diplexer are found as g12 = g34 = 1.7 mm, g14 = 2.5 
mm, g23 = 1.2 mm, g1’2’ = g3’4’ = 2 mm, g1’4’ = 4.35 mm, g2’3’ = 
0.65 mm, tA = 4.05 mm, tB = 3.35 mm, and gAB = 0.5 mm. All 
via holes used are of the same diameter 0.5 mm. The total 
area of the prototype diplexer is 53.1 mm × 38.8 mm, which 
is very compact and only about 50% of the conventional 
diplexer designed with half-wave SIRs. 
The simulated and measured S-parameters for the prototype 
design are plotted in Fig. 2, and they are in good agreement. 
The isolation between port 2 and port 3 is greater than 38 dB. 
The return losses measured at the three ports remain greater 
than 16 dB within the associated passbands, while the 
insertion losses measured within the lower and upper bands 
are below 1.5 dB and 1.9 dB, respectively. One can also see 
that there are two extra transmission zeros beside both 
passbands verifying the effectiveness of the cross-coupling 
effect. Besides, Fig. 3 shows the group delay measured within 
the two bands, and the flat responses indicate minimal signal 
distortion in both channels.

kept the same in the MPA and CPA. The CPA is designed by 
selecting the gap width g between the circular patch and the 
side plane to optimize the input matching. Both prototype 
antennas are fabricated on an FR4 substrate with dielectric 
constant r = 4.4, loss tangent tan  = 0.02, and substrate 
thickness h = 1.6 mm. The dimensions of the CBCPW and 
microstrip-line are G = 0.8 mm, S = 2.5 mm, and W = 3 mm, 
which correspond to both the characteristic impedances of 
CPW and microstrip line are 50-Ω. The radius r and width g 
are chosen to be 21 and 1 mm, respectively.  
All the simulated resonant frequencies and broadside gains 
of the CPA and MPA within the 1-7 GHz band along with 
the theoretical resonant frequencies of the circular patch 
resonator presented in [7] are listed in Table I. The 
simulated resonant frequencies of the CPA and MPA are 
nearly the same, and they also agree with those predicted by 
the circular patch resonator. It should be mentioned that by 
checking the resonant frequencies and the corresponding 
electrical current distributions of these antennas, the number 
of angular and diametrical antinodes of the TM41 mode 
discussed in [7] is actually one and three, respectively, which 
by definition should be TM12 mode. Besides, the TM12 mode 
discussed in [7] is by definition the TM41 mode. Hence, the 
order of TM41 mode and TM12 mode in TABLE I is 
interchanged. From the simulation results shown in Fig. 2, 
it’s found the performances of the CPA are quite similar to 
those of the MPA, especially near the resonant frequencies. 
This confirms the previous discussions and explains the

the characteristic impedance of 50-Ω. The diameter and the 
spacing (sV) of via-holes are 0.5 and 3 mm, respectively. The 
radius (rV) of via-holes surrounding circular patch is 25 mm. 
The length L of the ground plane is 70 mm. Fig. 7 presents 
the simulated and measured radiation patterns of the MPA, 
CPA, and the via-loaded CPA. The via-loaded CPA has a 
low cross polarization levels observed in the TM12 mode. 
Also, it could be observed that in the E-plane, serious pattern 
distortions exist, especially in the MPA and CPA. This is 
mainly due to the dominant TM0 surface wave, which causes 
the input impedance of a patch to vary with the ground plane 
size [9] and scallop the radiation patterns [10]-[11]. Also, 
since the patch element does not couple to the TM0 surface 
wave propagating in the H-plane direction, the ripples and 
pattern distortion exist only in the E-plane rather than in the 
H-plane [11]. From the measurement results, the via-loaded 
case has the most smooth radiation patterns in both E- and 
H- planes when operated in TM12 mode. The measured gain 
of the MPA, CPA, and via-loaded CPA in TM11 mode is 
0.16 dBi, -0.6 dBi, and 0.2 dBi, respectively, while those of 
these three antennas in TM12 mode is 4.35 dBi, 3.13 dBi, 
and 6.39 dBi, respectively. Clearly, in the fundamental TM11 
mode, all these three antennas behave similarly. There is no 
need for adding via-holes for enhancing the performances of 
the CPA in the TM11 mode because the size of the side 
ground plane is much less than a half guided wavelength in 
the resonant frequency of the TM11 mode. On the contrary, 
when operated in the higher order TM12 mode, the via-
loaded CPA has a larger realized gain and smoother 
radiation patterns than the other two antennas, which agrees 
well with the previous simulation results.  
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
The design considerations and operation principles of the 
circular CPA have been investigated in detail. It is shown 
that the characteristics of the CPA with infinite ground plane 
could be estimated by the circular patch resonator model, 
which is the same as the MPA. When a finite ground plane 
is taken into consideration, several obvious differences in 
both of the CPA and the MPA appear. The simulation and 
measurement results show that placing via alongside the 
feed-line and surrounding the circular patch could not only 
be used to improve the realized gain but also lower the cross 
polarization levels, especially in the TM12 mode operation. 
Meanwhile, it is demonstrated that when the size of the side 
ground plane is much less than a half guided wavelength, 
say in the TM11 mode, the above improvements are very 
limited because no serious side plane resonances appear.
