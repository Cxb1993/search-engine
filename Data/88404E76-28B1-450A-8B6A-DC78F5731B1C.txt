Noise Parameter Characterization of MOSFETs 
Yueh-Hua WANG, Member, Ming-Hsiang CHO, Nonmember, and Lin-Kun WU, Nonmember 
Summary 
A flexible noise de-embedding method for on-wafer 
microwave measurements of silicon MOSFETs is 
presented in this study. We use the open, short, and thru 
dummy structures to subtract the parasitic effects from the 
probe pads and interconnects of a fixtured MOS transistor. 
The thru standard are used to extract the interconnect 
parameters for subtracting the interconnect parasitics in 
gate, drain, and source terminals of the MOSFET. The 
parasitics of the dangling leg in the source terminal are 
also modeled and taken into account in the noise de-
embedding procedure. The MOS transistors and de-
embedding dummy structures were fabricated in a standard 
CMOS process and characterized up to 20 GHz. Compared 
with the conventional de-embedding methods, the 
proposed technique is more accurate and more area-
efficient.

1. Introduction 
Wafer-level device characterization is extremely important 
for the design of high-performance RF/microwave 
integrated circuits. Since reliable device models require 
accurate on-wafer measurements, modeling test keys 
should be carefully designed to reproduce and remove the 
external parasitics surrounding the fixtured devices. To 
extract the intrinsic device characteristics from microwave 
measurements, much research effort has been devoted to 
this subject and several methods for parasitic de-
embedding have been reported over the past years. The 
open-short de-embedding method [1] was developed to 
subtract the shunt admittance and series impedance of the 
probe pads and interconnects by employing an open and a 
short structure. Although there are many other methods for 
eliminating the unwanted parasitics [2]-[4], the open-short 
de-embedding procedure is still the current industry 
standard. The physics-based de-embedding methods 
mentioned above utilize lumped-circuit assumptions to 
model the parasitic networks. However, as the device is 
operated at microwave frequencies and/or its interconnect 
length is considerable, these lumped-circuit models may be 
invalid due to the distributed nature of silicon-based test 
fixtures. Recently, a noise de-embedding method based on 
cascade configuration [5] was presented. It uses open and 
thru dummies to subtract the pad admittance and 
interconnect parasitics and does not require any lumped-
circuit representation. A cascade-based scalable noise de-
embedding method [6] was also developed to reduce the 
chip area consumption for test structures. Although the

3. Results and Discussion 
To verify the proposed de-embedding theory, the DUT and 
de-embedding structures were fabricated using a 0.25 µm 
five-metal-layer CMOS process. The NMOS transistor 
with the dimensions of channel length (Lg) = 0.24 µm and 
channel width (Wg) = 160 µm was connected in a common-
source configuration. The lengths of the 10-µm wide 
interconnects and dangling leg are l1 = l2 = 50 µm and lg = 
42 µm. The on-wafer noise and S-parameter measurements 
were accomplished with the ATN NP5B Noise Parameter 
Measurement System.  
Figure 3 displays the measured and de-embedded 
reflection coefficients (S11 and S22) and transmission 
coefficients (S12 and S21) of the fixtured RF MOSFET. It is 
shown that the results obtained from the proposed method 
and the open-short method [1] are in excellent agreement 
over the entire frequency range. However, there are 
considerable differences between the proposed method and 
cascade method [6]. This is because that the parasitic 
effects of the dangling leg are ignored in the cascade de-
embedding procedures [5], [6]. Figure 4 shows the 
measured and de-embedded noise parameters as a function 
of frequency. These results indicate that the intrinsic noise 
parameters obtained from the proposed method also agree 
well with those from the open-short method. They also 
demonstrate the parasitics of the dangling leg can affect the 
noise characteristics of a MOS transistor, especially for 
equivalent noise resistance (Rn) and optimized input 
reflection coefficient (Γopt) at higher frequencies. Based on
