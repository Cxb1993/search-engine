possible to increase the area and the cost of the testing. On the other hand, when the 
3D ICs in the testing, it doesn't have heat sink and it is easy to have the highest the 
temperature in the bottom die and make the chip fail. The thermal dissipation is the 
critical problem is difficult for 3D ICs. 
The thermal has two properties that make 
it's not easy to estimate. It is 
unidirectional and accumulative. So, it 
has higher complexity to calculate the 
temperature. There are many different 
combination of the core, so it can 
evaluate all of circuit at one time. 
Because of those factors, it needs to 
optimize the test cycle, TAM width and 
temperature at the same time.

A. Problem definition: 
 The input file is divided four parts. The first file is provided the information 
of each core in the design such as power consumption. The second file describes 
the floorplanning information such as the location of each core. The third file 
offers the test information. It has the number of scan chain, test pin and test cycle. 
The last one file is used to control the program that have constrains such as the 
maximum of the test pins that can used to test, the upper bound of the 
temperature or the parameter of the material. 
 
 After it gets these data, the program will generate the test scheduling of this 
3D IC. It will try to minimized the test time and decide the TAM width in the 
limitation. The limitation is the constraint of the maximum test pin and the 
maximum temperature. 
 
B. Assumption: 
 In this part, it assumes the whole test schedule is divided into many slots. 
Between each slot, it needs time to configure DFT circuit such as the wrapper 
and control signals. It makes simplification to evaluate the temperature and test 
time. In each slot, the core is tested in the parallel and the test pin only can be 
access at the bottom die.  
 
 On the other hand, in order to estimate the cost, it uses a cost function to

 generating the new solution, it check the whether the constraint is meet or 
 not and estimates the cost. If the solution is meeting constraint and it  modifies 
 the  constraint of the total TAM width and repeat the process until the total 
 TAM width is smaller enough. Finally, it generates the solution in all 
 different TAM width that is smaller than the constraint and it choose the 
 smallest cost in this flow. 
hard die mode soft die mode 
 
  The soft die mode has a little difference of the hard die mode. In the 
 beginning, it's regarded the chip as the hard die and generates the solution by the 
 hard die mode. Because of the greedy algorithm can't handle the soft die, It just 
 only can decide the TAM width and a good initial solution for soft die. By the 
 simulated annealing algorithm, it can modify the each core, and try to find the 
 better solution. 
 
B. Greedy Algorithm: 
    This is the simple algorithm. 
First, it sorts the total core by the 
test cycle and put the core that has 
largest test cycle in the first slot. 
After doing two functions, it 
chooses the core that has second 
part in the list that after sorting and 
try to put in the first slot. If it meets 
constraint, it chooses the next core. 
If it doesn't meet constraint, it will 
be remove in this slot and try to put 
in the next slot.

 Until the total core is put in the slot, the process is finish and calculates

The result of case1: 
 
 
Because of the greedy algorithm, the TAM width is easy to be filled before 
violation the temperature constraint. After reach the temperature constraint, the 
TAM usage reduces by the TAM constraint increase and the test cycle reduce 
slowly. In this case, when the coefficient ratio between the alpha and beta is 
medium that we choose 10:1, it will choose that the TAM width is 52.

constraint. It means the result is the best solution that the algorithm can generate 
and it doesn't consider the cost of the TAM width. The points are the results that 
consider the constant ratio of the alpha and beta and the cost of the TAM width. 
In this figure, the alpha is 10 and the beta is 1 and assumes the area overhead per 
TAM is 10%. If the cost in the TAM is larger than the test time, the TAM width 
will become smaller.  
 
E. Result of Soft die 
 
Because the core can be modified the test cycle and the TAM width, it is 
efficiency to reduce the idle time and decrease the rate of empty TAM. In the 
case1, TAM constraint let most of critical cores that have the same test cycle can 
be test parallel and the other non-critical can be test at the same time or that can't 
modify. So it doesn't have any improve. The cost function has the relation 
between the average test time and TAM width that generates by the random 
process in the initialize. These coefficients will make influence of the cost after 
deciding the final TAM width but it isn't the real average TAM width in the 
lower constraint. On the other hand, it can't modify the TAM width in the process 
of the simulated annealing and it's possible to miss the optimal solution. 
 
6. Conclusion and Future Work: 
 In the beginning, we think the temperature is a unidirectional and accumulative 
problem. It can be quantize by the one constant value and has higher relation between 
each core. So, we used the simulated annealing and want to solve this problem. In 
addition, we tried the greedy algorithm and consider the temperature after set each 
core.
