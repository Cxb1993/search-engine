較可以在原有的反脈動效果外，增加心博量輸出。 
 
1-2 研究動機與目的
    本研究群於多次的動物實驗發現收縮卸載會造成表層冠狀動脈逆流，雖然在
舒張灌流時會有較大的順流，實質上在 IABP 輔助下，冠狀動脈的總流量增益並不
明顯。因此，傳統以流量來解釋反脈動的輔助效果似乎並不完全恰當。本研究提
出一假說，假設波動的傳遞為心肌灌流及逆向重建的主因，而波傳遞作用形成的
波動能量(Wave Intensity)是促進心肌復甦的主要原因。 
    本研究的目標在於建構一套數學模型，並用數值模擬來分析反脈動循環輔助
的波動特徵。本研究以 1)利用一維流場模型來模擬主動脈的波傳現象，並簡化人
體循環系統中其他複雜的細節，2)以 Windkessel 模型[18-20]模擬其它心血管次系
統，及 3)以壓力-體積關係來描述左右心室功能[21]。本研究結合一維流場與區塊
參數法(Lumped Parameter Method)，提出全新的混合循環模式(Hybrid Circulation 
Model)。採用的數值方法為上風 Roe 近似里曼算子[22]，使用 Runge-Kutta 時間步
進法來積分此耦合模型。並以波強度分析法(Wave Intensity Analysis)量化輔助時向
冠狀動脈入流口及腹主動脈下游所產生的波動強度之間的差異程度。 
 
1-3 波強度分析法 
Parker, Jones and Tyberg [23-25]以空氣動力學分析波傳遞的方法應用於血液循
環，將波的傳遞方向分為順向傳遞的波 (Forward-Going Wave) 、反向波
(Backward-Going Wave)，並區分壓縮特徵為壓縮波(Compression Wave)與膨脹波
(Expansion Wave)，因此在血管中傳遞的波動特徵可有順向壓縮波、順向膨脹波、
反向壓縮波及反向膨脹波四種組合(表 1-1)。壓縮波有擠壓的作用，能增加壓力。
順向的壓縮波(FCW)會增加波動流場的壓力及速度；而反向的壓縮波(BCW)則會增
加壓力但降低流速。膨脹波則會降低壓力，在順向的膨脹波(FEW)動流場中，壓力
及速度都降低；而反向的膨脹波(BEW)動流場中，壓力降低但速度增加。Parker [23]

investigate the detailed prosthetic flowfield.  Our design contains disturbed 
T-bifurcation anastomotic flow within the non-biological conduit and let the 
high-shear turbulent wash-out minimizes the cell adherence on the prosthetic wall.  
It was found that in our design that the blood damage index is low in the subclinical 
range which literally contributes to the thromoresistance of the present PABP.  Since 
our presentation is the first debut to the ASAIO audiences so I also gave a brief 
review of the DP-biVAD design principle in the beginning of our work.  Our 
pulsatile device goes against the current continuous or rotary pump design trend.  
DPbi-VAD is simple but therapeutic and we advocate early intervention and 
bridge-to-recovery as the implant objective.  This is again different from the current 
VAD indications which are intended to be used as the last resort modality for 
terminal-stage heart failure patients.  I stated the design merits and showed the 
in-vivo experimental video demonstrating the easiness and safety in surgical operation 
and the efficacy of counter- and co-pulsation support.  During our presentation many 
audience shot pictures of our slides.  In the subsequent Q/A period I and Dr. Lin 
were further questioned about how we can make the animal survive without the 
administration of anti-coagulant.  The answer lies in the hemodymic merits 
pertaining to the present design.  Turbulence was kept low in the subclinical region, 
however with good flowfield washout management to exclude those thrombogenic 
stasis and recirculation zones.  We also showed a concurrent on-going survival 
experiment for which the subject pig has survived 21 days already.  People felt 
interested in our design and the new results, in particular the no reliance on 
anti-coagulant part.  One active ASAIO senior expert from Vienna University 
noticed our co-pulsatile sac device.  They had poor experience in the diastolic 
support performance due to the vacuum suction fixation method.  They are curious 
about how we did it without hampering the cardiac diastolic performance.  In fact, 
we invented a new method called “soft-fixation” which is yet fully protected by the 
pending IP filing.  This prevented us from giving sac design a clear explanation on 
the conference presentation but will be our next-year abstract subject to be submitted 
to the 55th ASAIO annual meeting.   We are glad to see that our design has injected 
some new thoughts to the society.  However, in the mean time the exposition also 
returns us much difficult challenges to overcome in the future.  The next objective 
for us is to demonstrate the long-term efficacy and safety of our DPbi-VAD when 
implanted in-vivo.  The task calls for order of magnitude elevation of our R/D scale, 
in manpower and in budget, before we can really become a potent contestant and 
eventually earn international recognition.   Seeking for venture capital investment is 
the next stage game plan.  Many aspects related to commercialization are not 
familiar to us.  This sets the primary reason that sends us to this meeting.

in-vivo, will be used to validate the efficacy and safety of the proposed device.  
Professional societies and ad-hoc committees had issued recommendations that were 
published in the past.  However, there exist some new critical path tools that may be 
adopted.  FDA strongly suggests sending pre-clinical proposal to the responsible 
agent and hold round-table discussions before test commencement to seek for mutual 
agreement on how the pre-clinical tests will be conducted.  The proposal might 
include the following contents: 1) Biomarkers, 2) Animal model of human diseases, 3) 
Clinical trial design, 4) Computer simulations, 5) Quality assessment protocols, and 6) 
Post market reporting.  Among them, computer simulations are the new methods that 
can be used.  Nevertheless, FDA claims that CFD simulation is yet justified nor 
required and there is an on-going project that evaluates the simulation validity in 
device safety assessment.  Standard blind test problem was given as illustrated on a 
poster presentation and FDA invites interested groups to participate this new method 
development trial.   
 
Device Performance and Reliability 
   I also attended the second day luncheon “Device Performance Standards and 
Reliability.”  Because the contemporary VAD applications cover both 
bridge-to-transplantation and alternative-to-transplantation (destination therapy), FDA 
initiated an update in response to the redefined long-term, 5-10 years, mission and the 
new requirements specified for destination therapy.  Device performance standards 
and reliability were hence revisited.  Laboratory experiences are more predictive in 
terms of durability and reliability as compared to the clinical results which may be 
patient-dependent and are in general difficult to accumulate.  To correlate in-vitro 
and in-vivo test results, VAD designers should understand what the clinically relevant 
lab tests are.  Loading and strength are elucidated to explain how device should be 
designed to avoid malfunction and/or failure during operation.  In the preparation of 
the preclinical draft submitted to FDA, the contents should include: 1) Test 
methodology, 2) Flowchart of methodology, 3) Sample size and statistic method, 4) 
Mock loop parameters, 5) Subsystem testing, 6) Changes subsequent to start of test, 
and 7) Information for surgeons and prospective patients.   
Load affects test results and often acceleration tests are used to assess the device 
durability.  How testing load conditions should be set for in-vitro tests is still an open 
question.  Good example is the magnetic levitation rotary pump, for which the wear 
is no longer related to loading directly.  For our displacement type blood pump 
constructed using polymeric materials, flexing of diaphragm under physiological 
condition defines the device reliability.  Other blood contacting material problems 
pertaining to polymers, such as calcification, material aging, etc still influence the

Forum” was conducted with the participation of the MIT Sloan School of 
Management.  MIT MBA students participated in the business plan writing to 
contribute to the business model development which is unfamiliar to the inventors.  
Four fund raising presentations were delivered in front of a panel consisting of 
venture capitalists and FDA officials as well as the ASAIO senior members.  
Panelists asked questions which helps the modification of the business plan.  It was 
very informative and educational for the audience.  On the last-day plenary ASAIO 
Hasting Lecture Dr. Thomas Fogarty, a retired Stanford professor and the Fogarty 
tube inventor, was invited to conduct a two-way dialogue with the audience, sharing 
his personal experiences in inventing and commercializing new devices.  Prof. 
Fogarty gave strict comments to the academia as anti-commercialization because in 
his career time faculty ought to leave school whenever they involved in the 
money-related new device investment.  He also downplays the FDA regulatory role 
because overly emphasizing from the patient perspectives impairs the new device 
development and the timely entry into the marketplace.  Nowadays academia and 
industry cooperation underwent fundamental changes.  University encourages his 
faculty and students to become entrepreneurial.  FDA positively engaged in new 
device development and started reviewing its existing regulatory guidelines.  The 
ultimate goal is “To optimize the patient’s benefit.”  I also attended the subsequent 
luncheon “The ASAIO New Venture Forum: Strategies for the Creation of a 
Sustainable Entrepreneurial Ecosystem.”  This MBA-supported initiative is still in 
its infancy stage.  Successful or not depends heavily on the student’s experiences in 
product commercialization and their extracurricular devotion.  The screening of 
qualified student candidates and the expert assistance provided by the ASAIO society 
will be the key to the success of this program. 
 
Epilogue 
I also attended the poster sessions.  The general trend of VAD development has 
overwhelmingly biased toward the rotary pumps.  Many papers addressed the rotary 
pump control problems.  Avoidance of ventricular suction and aortic valve fusion are 
two major objectives that direct the control algorithm design.  Rotary pumps now 
tend to operate in a pulsatile manner to generate appropriate pulsatility in circulation 
assistance.  When considering physiological conditions of rest, normal, and exercise, 
the control of pump speed becomes complex and the motor efficiency deteriorates.  
Whether or not cardiac output would be enhanced depends on the operational pump 
speed in conjunction with the opening or closing of the aortic valve.  The switching 
between volume unloading and pressure unloading adds further complexity to the 
pumping control.  Compromise often arises among cardiac output enhancement,
