Abstract — A novel compact design of planar multi-band 
monopole antenna for IEEE 802.16m WiMAX system is 
proposed. With the use of C- and L-shaped monopole 
strips, multi resonant modes close to 2.6 / 3.5 / 5.5 GHz 
band are excited to meet the specifications of WiMAX 
system (IEEE 802.16m). And, the obtained impedance 
bandwidth across the operating bands can reach about 201 
/ 330 / 1195 MHz for the 2.6 / 3.5 / 5.5 GHz bands, 
respectively. Only with the antenna size of 22 × 28 × 0.8 
mm3, the proposed monopole antenna has the compact 
operation with more than 35 % antenna size reduction. The 
measured peak gains and radiation efficiencies are about 
4.1 / 4.3 / 4.5 dBi and 82 / 75 / 88% for the 2.6 / 3.5 / 5.5 GHz 
band, respectively, with nearly omni-directional pattern in 
the XY-plane.

I. INTRODUCTION 
ith rapid development in wireless communication to 
provide quick and easy wireless access, several 
wireless systems integrated in a single portable 
device has become a major new trend. Unlike using 
multiple single-band antennas for multi-band operations, 
a multi-band antenna can cover simultaneously several 
operating bands for different wireless services. And, the 
great demands in antenna design include low-profile, 
lightweight, easy fabrication, and multi-band operation. 
Thus, to meet the specifications of the Worldwide 
Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) 
applications covering the bands of 2.6/3.5/5.5 GHz, the 
use of compact multi-band antennas is very attractive and 
important to practical commercial applications for 
broadband access in wireless metropolitan area network 
(WMAN) environment. Meanwhile, the planar monopole 
antenna has attracted high attention because it has the 
merit of low profile and can provide the feature of 
multi-band operation. The related monopole antenna (MA) 
designs for WiMAX application have been presented by 
using dual U-shaped MA [1], inverted L-shaped MA [2], 
rhomb shaped MA with slits [3], inverted-F antenna [4], 
MA with branch slits [5], MA with rectangular horizontal 
strips and trapezoidal ground plane [6], mirrored-L 
monopole antenna [7], asymmetric rectangular MA with 
additional strips [8], a planar rectangular MA connected 
with a circular disc by via hole [9], MA loaded with four 
different grooves [10], MA using branch strips [11] and 
pentagonal MA with two thin bent slots [12]. However, 
there is the disadvantage of being larger antenna size for 
these above MAs [2-4, 6] or complex antenna structure [7, 
10-12]. And, there is increasing demand for antennas 
having more compact size to be suitably embedded in the 
practical portable devices for multi-input / multi-output 
(MIMO) WiMAX (IEEE 802.16m) system. In [13], the 
authors presented a novel planar monopole antenna with 
various monopole strips’ widths for multi-band WiMAX 
communication only by measurement. In order to 
introduce the design criteria of the proposed compact 
monopole antenna more thoroughly, we propose this 
novel antenna design by simplifying all monopole strips’ 
widths to be 1 mm for lowering the manufacturing process 
errors and adding some simulated results to authenticate 
the measured results. From the related measured results, 
it provides wider impedance bandwidth of 201 / 330 / 
1195 MHz for the 2.6 / 3.5 / 5.5 GHz bands, respectively. 
This proposed planar monopole antenna also provides 
the nearly omni-directional radiation patterns with 
maximum peak antenna gains and radiation efficiencies 
of 4.1 / 4.3 / 4.5 dBi and 82 / 75 / 88% across the 
operating bands, respectively. And, compared with the 
presented antenna designs in the literature [2-8, 10, 12], 
this proposed monopole antenna has more than 35 % 
antenna size reduction to obtain compact operation. 
Details of the proposed monopole antenna design are 
described in this study, and the related results for the 
obtained performance operated across the 2.6 / 3.5 / 5.5 
GHz bands are presented and discussed.

frequency for the proposed compact monopole 
antenna; antenna parameters are given in Table 1. 
 
To fully comprehend the excitation of each WiMAX 
bands, the simulated surface current distributions at 
typical frequencies are shown in Fig. 3, along with an 
additional blue arrow sign showing the excited current 
path of each resonant mode. From the surface current 
distributions, it can be seen that the C-shaped monopole 
strip (A → B → C) is excited at its fundamental mode at 
2.6 GHz and its higher-order modes at 5.5 GHz with a 
0.25 and 0.53 wavelength surface current distributions 
shown in Fig. 3(a) and 3(e), respectively. As for 3.4 GHz 
resonant mode, relatively stronger excited surface 
current distribution in the C-shaped parasitic strip (D → E) 
is illustrated in Fig. 3(b). Due to strong coupling effect, 
large surface currents are excited for the L-shaped 
monopole strip. Along the L-shaped shorting strip with an 
effective path (F → G) shown in Fig. 3(c), a 0.23 
wavelength surface current is excited for the 3.6 GHz 
resonant mode. And, the resonant mode operating at 5.1 
GHz band is easily excited with a 0.25 wavelength 
surface current distribution along the L-shaped monopole 
strip (A → H).

L-shaped monopole strip and C-shaped parasitic strip, 
when the length L3 decreases, the 3.4 GHz resonant 
mode is degenerated to make the obtained bandwidth of 
the antenna’s second (WiMAX 3.5 GHz) band quickly 
decreased and unable to cover the desired frequency 
range of 3.4–3.7 GHz. And, the 5.1 GHz operating 
frequency significantly decreases with the length L3 
increased. Some effects on the first (WiMAX 2.6 GHz) 
band are also seen, which are, however, small compared 
to those on the second and third bands. The related 
results are listed in Table 4 as comparison. This proposed 
simple antenna design provides distinct multi-band 
operation by controlling the proposed strips’ length.

The radiation measurement of the proposed monopole 
antenna is carried out in anechoic chamber by 
introducing NSI 800F 3D far-field system. The measured 
peak gains and radiation efficiencies across the operating 
bands are shown in Fig. 7 with the simulated results as 
comparison. Good agreement is seen between the 
measured and simulated results. The maximum 
measured peak antenna gain is 4.1 / 4.3 / 4.5 dBi and 82 / 
75 / 88% at 2.6 / 3.5 / 5.5 GHz, which is more than that of 
those presented monopole antenna designs [1-12]. The 
measured 2D radiation patterns in three principal planes 
of the planar monopole antenna centered at 2.6 / 3.5 / 5.5 
GHz are plotted in Fig. 8. It is easily found that the 
radiation patterns are with good omni-directional radiation 
pattern in the XY plane. Since the proposed antenna’ 
structure is unsymmetrical with respect to the antenna 
axis ( = 0) to make that the 2D radiation patterns in the 
YZ plane are tilted probably due to the surface current 
distribution concentrated in the -Y direction.

ABSTRACT: This article proposes a novel planar dipole array antenna with dual-band 
operation for LTE / WiMAX communication systems. This array antenna is comprised 
of four dipole antennas to obtain high gain with the array antenna size of only 32 × 246 
mm2. The impedance bandwidths, determined from VSWR ≦ 2.0, can reach about 555 
/ 765 MHz (21.3 / 21.9 %) for the 2.6 / 3.5 GHz operating bands, respectively, which is 
covering the required bandwidth for LTE (2.5 ~ 2.7 GHz) and WiMAX (3.3 ~ 3.7 GHz) 
system. This proposed dual-band dipole array also provides maximum peak antenna 
gains and efficiencies of 6.9 / 6.5 dBi and 85 / 79 % across 2.6 / 3.5 GHz bands, 
respectively, with good omni-directional radiation pattern in XY-plane.

obtained high-gain performance are presented and discussed. 
 
2. ANTENNA DESIGN 
Fig. 1 illustrates the geometry of the proposed omnidirectional dipole array 
antenna for 2.6 / 3.5 GHz LTE / WiMAX access points. Design criteria and dimensions 
of the feeding network are shown in Fig. 2. The characteristic impedance of each 
microstrip-line section of the feeding network are listed in Fig. 2. The feeding network 
in the proposed array antenna is designed to have equal powers in phase at the eight 
points A ~ H, with the input impedance of 50  which is simpler than the presented 
antenna designs [1-4]. The proposed dual-band array is fed by a 50 coaxial cable line 
at the center of the microstrip line (point O) which is etched on the printed both sides of 
an inexpensive FR4 substrate with the volume of 246 × 32 × 0.8 mm3, dielectric 
constant r = 4.7 and loss tangent tan δ = 0.0245. This proposed planar dual-band array 
is comprised of four dual-dipole back-to-back elements with the spacing of Ld, which 
are arranged symmetrically with respect to the central narrow rectangular ground plane 
of width Wg printed on the rear surface of the FR4 substrate to obtain onmi-directional 
radiation pattern in the azimuthal plane. In this study, each printed dipole element has 
dual-arm identical dipoles having the strip’s length of L1 and L2 and width of W1 and 
W2 with the gap of G1. The longer-arm strip is designed to be oblique openings to 
reduce the the dipole antenna’s size for compact operation, which is different from these 
presented dipole array designs [1-2, 4-5]. Note also that the upper and lower arms of 
each dipole element are printed on two sides of the FR4 substrate, respectively; that is, 
the upper arm on the front side connected to the feeding network at points A ~ H, and 
the lower arm on the rear side connected to the central ground plane. The fundamental 
resonant mode of each printed longer-arm dipole element is excited at 2.6 GHz band 
with the longer-arm strip’s length chosen to be about 22.5 mm from point A to the end 
of the dipole strip. And, by introducing the shorter-arm dipole, the second resonant 
mode operating at 3.5 GHz band can be excited due to the resonant length of the shorter 
 5
The array spacing effects on the performance of the proposed planar dipole array 
antenna were also studied. Fig. 6 shows the measured VSWR as a function of the array 
spacing, Ld, for this proposed dual-band dipole array. The optimal array spacing in this 
study was found to be about 64 mm ( ～ 0.55 o, o is the free-space wavelength of 
the center operating frequency 2.6 GHz). The obtained results indicate that, when the 
array spacing varies, two resonant frequencies of the proposed dipole array also varies. 
This behavior is probably because the array spacing will affect the coupling between the 
upper and lower dipoles in the proposed dipole element, which in turn changes the 
effective dipole-arm operating length to make two resonant frequencies varied. The 
corresponding measured data are also given in Table 4 for easy comparison. 
The 3D radiation patterns of the proposed planar dula-band dipole array are 
measured in anechoic chamber by using NSI-800F with Agilent PNA N5230A. Fig. 7 
shows the simulated and measured peak gains and efficiencies of the planar dula-band 
dipole array. The maximum measured peak antenna gains and efficiencies are 6.9 / 6.5 
dBi and 85 / 79 % across 2.6 / 3.5 GHz bands, respectively. Fig. 8 shows the measured 
2D radiation patterns of the proposed planar dipole array operating at 2.6 / 3.5 GHz 
bands. It is found that the radiation patterns are with good onmi-directional radiation 
patterns in the X-Y plane, which resemble typical patterns in symmetry with respect to 
the antenna axis ( = 0) since the proposed dipole array’ structure is symmetrical.

4. CONCLUSIONS 
A novel planar dual-band dipole array with high-gain operation for LTE / WiMAX 
access point has been proposed and investigated. It provides relatively wider impedance 
bandwidth of 555 / 765 MHz (21.3 / 21.9 %) to meet the specifications of LTE ( 2.5 ~ 
2.7 GHz ) and WiMAX ( 3.3 ~ 3.7 GHz ) systems, respectively. Also, the proposed 
dipole array provides maximum peak antenna gains and efficiencies of 6.9 / 6.5 dBi and 
85 / 79 % across the 2.6 / 3.5 GHz operating bands with good omni-directional radiation 
pattern in the X-Y plane, respectively.

four-element collinear array antenna [3]. However, these above array 
antennas were focused on the single-band operation. For dual-band operation, 
only the array design [4] had been proposed by using one dipole antenna for 
2.4 GHz and 1 × 2 array antenna for 5.2 GHz WLAN communication. And, 
there was a disadvantage of lower antenna gain (less than 4 dBi), which were 
unsuitably in the practical applications for LTE / WiMAX access points. 
Meanwhile, dual-band dipole array for LTE / WiMAX applications is very scant 
in the open literature. Therefore, in this article, we propose a novel planar 
dual-band dipole array mainly comprises two 1 × 4 dipole arrays arranged 
back to back, and can be easily constructed by printing on both sides of a 
dielectric substrate (see the geometry shown in Fig. 1). By properly adjusting 
the arms’ lengths of each unsymmetrical dipole element, the operating 
bandwidths (VSWR ≦ 2.0) can reach about 525 / 747 MHz (20.2 / 21.3 %), 
which are enough for LTE and WiMAX system. Also, the proposed dipole 
array provides maximum peak antenna gains and efficiencies of 7.3 / 7.5 dBi 
and 89 / 75 % across 2.6 / 3.5 GHz bands, respectively, with good 
omnidirectional radiation pattern in the azimuthal plane and 
narrow-beamwidth pattern in the elevation plane. Details of the proposed 
dual-band dipole array designs are described, and experimental results for the 
obtained high-gain performance are presented and discussed. 
 
Antenna design and experimental results: Fig. 1 illustrates the geometry 
of the proposed omnidirectional dipole array antenna for 2.6 / 3.5 GHz LTE / 
WiMAX access points. The dimensions of the feeding network composed of

2.6 / 3.5 GHz bands. From the experimental results, the measured impedance 
bandwidths (VSWR ≦ 2.0) can reach 525 / 747 MHz (20.2 / 21.3 %) for 2.6 / 
3.5 GHz bands, respectively, to provide more impedance bandwidth to meet 
the specifications of LTE and WiMAX systems. The 3D radiation patterns of 
the proposed dual-band dipole array are measured in anechoic chamber by 
using NSI-800F with Agilent PNA N5230A. Fig. 3 shows the simulated and 
measured peak gains and efficiencies of the planar dula-band dipole array. 
The maximum measured peak antenna gains and efficiencies are 7.3 / 7.5 dBi 
and 89 / 75 % across 2.6 / 3.5 GHz bands, respectively. Fig. 4 shows the 
measured 2D radiation patterns of the proposed planar dipole array operating 
at 2.6 / 3.5 GHz bands. It is found that the radiation patterns are with good 
onmi-directional radiation patterns in the X-Y plane, which resemble typical 
patterns in symmetry with respect to the antenna axis ( = 0) since the 
proposed dipole array’ structure is symmetrical. 
 
Conclusions: A novel planar dual-band dipole array with high-gain operation 
for LTE / WiMAX access point has been proposed and investigated. It 
provides relatively wider impedance bandwidth of 525 / 747 MHz (20.2 / 21.3 
%) to meet the specifications of LTE ( 2.5 ~ 2.7 GHz ) and WiMAX ( 3.3 ~ 3.7 
GHz ) systems, respectively. Also, the proposed dual-band dipole array 
provides maximum peak antenna gains and efficiencies of 7.3 / 7.5 dBi and 
89 / 75 % across the 2.6 / 3.5 GHz operating bands with good 
omni-directional radiation pattern in the X-Y plane, respectively.

Abstract—This article proposes a novel 4-sector cylindrical-
rectangular microstrip array with high-gain operation and multi-beam
radiation for IEEE 802.11j MIMO WLAN system. With the use of
1×2 array, the impedance bandwidth for the operating band of 5GHz
can reach about 2.5% (125MHz), which is enough for IEEE 802.11j
specifications. Peak antenna gains across the operating band are close
to 11.0 dBi with the gain variations of 0.3 dBi.
1. INTRODUCTION
Due to rapid developments in WLAN communication technology and
limited bandwidth of 2.4GHz band for multi-application systems
such as IEEE 802.11b/g, Bluetooth and Zigbee systems, high-gain
operation with multi-beam radiation characteristics in the 5GHz
band is becoming demanding in IEEE 802.11j multi-input/multi-
output (MIMO) applications to achieve long-distance communication.
Several high-gained antenna designs had been presented by using
the array antenna with antenna height increased [1], parasitic
elements [2], dielectric substrate with high permittivity [3, 4] and
PBG structure [5, 6]. However, the cylindrical-rectangular microstrip
array with multi-beam radiation for MIMO WLAN (IEEE 802.11j)
applications is very scant in the open literature. Therefore, in this

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
The electromagnetic simulator HFSS based on the finite element
method [10] has been applied for the proposed cylindrical-rectangular
microstrip array design to demonstrate the above deduction and
guarantee the correctness of simulated results. Figure 2 shows the
related simulated and experimental results of VSWR for the proposed
array design of Figure 1(b) with various antenna lengths. The
related results are listed in Table 1 as comparison. Results show
the satisfactory agreement for the proposed array design operating
at 5GHz band. It is found that, by properly adjusting the spacing
between two cylindrical-rectangular microstrip antennas close to
58.9mm, which is about 0.98λ0 with respect to the operating frequency
of 5GHz, the obtained impedance bandwidth (VSWR 5 1.5) is
125MHz (2.5%). This proposed cylindrical-rectangular microstrip
array can provide much greater impedance bandwidth to meet the
IEEE 802.11j specifications of MIMO WLAN communication system.

strips [5], inverted-F antenna [6], mirrored-L MA [7], MA with
rectangular horizontal strips and trapezoidal ground plane [8], a planar
rectangular MA connected with a circular disc by via hole [9], MA with
an etched ∩-shaped slot and a parasitic ring resonator [10], MA with
two semi-circle strips [11], T-shaped MA with a trapezoidal ground
plane [12], MA with C-shaped and S-shaped meander strips [13],
inverted L-shaped MA [14] and dual U-shaped MA [15]. However,
there is the disadvantage of being larger antenna size for these above
MAs [1–7] and increasing demand for antennas having more compact
size to be suitably embedded in the practical portable devices for
WLAN/WiMAX application. And, the related T-shaped monopole
antenna designs [16–19] had been presented and only focused at
dual-band (2.45/5GHz) operation for WLAN system by using longer
monopole strip to excite the lower (2.45GHz) operating frequency
and shorter strip for the resonance of the higher (5GHz) band [16–
18] or with triple-T monopole antenna for 2.45, 5.2 and 5.8GHz
WLAN operations [19]. However, the compact T-shaped monopole
antenna design for WLAN/WiMAX system is scant in the literature
except for the proposed antenna design [12] with less antenna peak
gain. Therefore, in this article, we propose a novel planar T-
shaped monopole antenna with a pair of mirrored L-shaped strips for
multi-band WLAN/WiMAX communication. And, from the related
measured results, it provides relatively wider impedance bandwidth
of 160/1100/2690MHz for the 2.45/3.5/5.5GHz bands, respectively.
The proposed planar monopole antenna also provides the nearly omni-
directional radiation patterns with maximum measured peak antenna
gains and radiation efficiencies of 3.2/3.5/5.4 dBi and 72/98/96%
across the operating bands, respectively, which are more than that for
the presented compact antenna designs [8–10, 12–14]. Also, compared
with the presented antenna designs in the literature [1–7, 16–19], this
proposed monopole antenna has more than 20% antenna size reduction
to achieve compact operation. Details of the proposed monopole
antenna design are described, and experimental results for the obtained
performance operated across the 2.45/3.5/5.5GHz bands are presented
and discussed.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
To demonstrate the above deduction and guarantee the correctness
of simulated results, the electromagnetic simulator HFSS based on the
finite element method [20] has been applied for the proposed monopole
antenna design. Figure 2 shows the related simulated and experimental
38 Lu and Li
bands, the surface current distributions at 2.45, 3.5 and 5.5GHz are
shown in Figure 3, along with an additional pinky arrow sign showing
the path length of each resonant mode. For both 2.45 and 5.5GHz
modes, they are clearly the conventional MA modes showing a near
0.25 and 0.5 wavelength distribution along the surface current path
(A → B → C), respectively. As for 3.5GHz resonant mode, a 0.25
wavelength distribution along an effective path (A → D → E) is
observed in Figure 3(b).
The measured return losses for the proposed T-shaped monopole
antenna with various lengths (L1) of the T-shaped patch are illustrated
in Figure 4. By properly decreasing the T-shaped patch’s length (L1)
from 22mm to 16mm, the operating frequencies near 2.45/5.5GHz

current path (A→ D→ E) also extends to make the 3.5GHz operating
frequency significantly decreased with the operating frequencies near
2.45GHz band less varied. The related measured return losses are
illustrated in Figure 5. And, it is seen that the operating frequency
at the 5.5GHz band has also been influenced by the mutual coupling
between the T-shaped patch and L-shaped strip. This defect can be
overcome by extending the horizontal arm (L2) of the L-shaped strip
with the vertical length (L4) decreased to reduce the mutual coupling
effect.
To study the antenna size reduction for the proposed T-shaped
monopole antenna, the comparisons of the overall antenna volume
including the ground plane for this proposed and other presented
antenna designs in the literature [1–7, 16–19] are listed in Table 4. It is
seen that this proposed monopole antenna has more than 20% antenna
size reduction to obtain compact operation, which is more suitable for
embedding into the USB dongle.

efficiency is about 80%–96% over the 5.5GHz band. The measured
two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) radiation patterns
at 2.45, 3.5 and 5.5GHz are plotted in Figure 7 with the simulated
results as comparison. It is easily found that the radiation patterns
are with good omni-directional radiation pattern in the XY plane
and broadside radiation in the XZ and Y Z plane which resemble
typical dipole patterns in symmetry with respect to the antenna axis
(θ = 0) since the proposed antenna is symmetrical. In Figure 7(c),
probably due to L-shaped strip close to the T-shaped monopole patch
to have the coupling effect, the radiation pattern at the operating
frequency of 5.5GHz, which is the second mode of the proposed T-
shaped monopole patch, becomes similar to that at the fundamental
frequency of 2.45GHz.
4. CONCLUSIONS
A novel compact design of planar T-shaped monopole antenna
with multi-band operation for WLAN/WiMAX system has been
proposed. The obtained impedance bandwidth across the operating
bands can reach about 160/1100/2690MHz for the 2.45/3.5/5.5GHz
bands, respectively. Only with the antenna size of 30 × 42 ×
0.8mm3, the proposed monopole antenna has the compact operation
with more than 20% antenna size reduction. The proposed

GHz (2400–2484 MHz), 5.2 GHz (5150–5350 MHz) and 5.8 GHz
(5725–5825 MHz) bands, dual-band operations become demanding
in practical applications. However, for some practical applications,
single 2.45-GHz band with high-gain operation for WLAN access
point (AP) can meet the requirements with the consideration of
lowest cost for the users. The related antenna designs have been
presented by using microstrip antenna [1], array antenna [2], sus-
pended patch antenna [3], the roll monopole antenna [4], and H-
shaped slot antenna [5]. However, the above presented designs
need larger antenna size that is unable to meet the dimension con-
sideration of the product and the requirement of the portable devi-
ces. Therefore, in this article, we propose a novel planar compact
inverted U-shaped patch antenna capacitively coupled-fed by the
regular microstrip line to obtain high-gain operation for 2.45 GHz
band in WLAN communication system. From the related results, it
is found that, by properly adjusting the length and width of the
microstrip line, the operating bandwidth for 2.45 GHz band is 162
MHz (6.6%), which is enough for WLAN application. The pro-
posed inverted U-shaped patch antenna also provides peak antenna
gain of 7.5 dBi with compact antenna size, which is more than that
of the presented antenna designs [1–5]. Details of the proposed
compact patch antenna designs are described, and experimental
results for the obtained high-gain performance operated at the 2.45
GHz band are presented and discussed.
2. ANTENNA DESIGN
To meet the low-proﬁle requirement for the WLAN AP, a novel
planar compact inverted U-shaped antenna with high-gain opera-
tion has been proposed. Figure 1 shows the geometry of the pro-
posed compact inverted U-shaped patch antenna. A 50-X mini
coaxial cable line is fed at the end of the microstrip line etched
on the inexpensive FR-4 substrate with the volume of 35  45
 0.4 mm3, dielectric constant er ¼ 4.7, and loss tangent tan d
¼ 0.0245. The electromagnetic energy is transferred from the
microstrip line capacitively coupled to the proposed inverted U-
shaped patch antenna. The iron plate is used as the ground plane
with a volume of 37  56  0.1 mm3, which has the air gap of
3.5 mm under the proposed compact patch antenna with the FR-
4 substrate in this study. The total antenna height of the pro-
posed compact patch is only 4 mm equal to 0.033k for 2.45
GHz band to achieve low-proﬁle feature. For achieving the reso-
nant mode at 2.45 GHz band for IEEE 802.11 b/g application, a
surface current route of the patch antenna starting from the point
A to the end point B is chosen to be about 46 mm correspond-
ing approximately to 0.37k for 2.45 GHz band, which is

Abstract—A novel compact multi-band design of planar C-shape
monopole antenna with inverted L-shape parasitic strip is proposed
for IEEE 802.16m WiMAX system. The obtained impedance
bandwidth across the 2.6/3.5/5.5GHz operating bands can reach
about 240/570/4470MHz, respectively. Only with the antenna size
of 15×30×0.8mm3, the proposed monopole antenna has the compact
operation with more than 25% antenna size reduction. The measured
peak gains and radiation efficiencies are about 1.6/1.9/2.9 dBi and
91/96/94% for the 2.6/3.5/5.5GHz operating band, respectively, with
nearly omni-directional pattern in the XY -plane.
1. INTRODUCTION
Due to the rapid developments of wireless communication technology,
several wireless systems integrated in a single portable device has
become a major new trend. Especially, the Worldwide Interoperability
for Microwave Access (WiMAX) system with three allocated frequency
bands of 2.6/3.5/5.5GHz has recently attracted great attention due
to the theoretical up to 30-mile radius coverage and the data rate
of 70Mbps to make multi-band operation become demanding in
practical applications for broadband access in wireless metropolitan
area network (WMAN) environment. Unlike using multiple single-
band antennas for multi-band operations, a multi-band antenna can
simultaneously cover several operating bands for different wireless
services. The great demands in antenna design include low-profile,

2. ANTENNA DESIGN
A novel planar C-shape monopole antenna with inverted L-shape
parasitic strip has been proposed to meet multi-band operation
requirement for WiMAX system. Fig. 1 illustrates the geometry
and photos of the proposed compact C-shape monopole antenna. A
microstrip line of 50Ω is connected to point A as the feeding structure
and etched on the inexpensive FR4 substrate with the antenna volume
of 15 × 30 × 0.8mm3, dielectric constant εr = 4.7 and loss tangent
tan δ = 0.0245.

operation.
The C-shape monopole strip (A → B → C) is arranged at the
front side of the proposed compact antenna to excite the fundamental
and second modes near 2.6/5.5GHz bands in this study. By adding the
inverted L-shape parasitic strip (A → D → E → F) at the back side,
the fundamental mode near 3.5GHz band can be easily excited. For
achieving the resonant mode at 2.6 GHz band, the total length of the
C-shape monopole strip (A → B → C) is chosen to be about 31.5mm
corresponding approximately to 0.27/0.54 operating wavelengths of
2.6/5.5GHz bands, respectively, which is a little longer than 0.25/0.5
operating wavelength probably due to the coupling effect caused by the
inverted L-shape parasitic strip. Detailed effects of the total length
on the antenna performances are analyzed with the aid of Table 2
and Fig. 4 in Section 3. Then, to obtain the resonant mode for
3.5GHz WiMAX operation, the excited length (A → D → E → F)
including the inverted L-shape parasitic strip is chosen to be about
21mm corresponding approximately to 0.25 operating wavelength of
3.5GHz bands. The antenna performances versus the inverted L-shape
parasitic strip’s length is shown in Fig. 5 and listed in Table 3 as

From the experimental results, the measured impedance bandwidth
(RL = 10 dB) can reach 9.2/16.1/62.4% (240/570/4470MHz) for
2.6/3.5/5.5GHz bands, respectively, which provides much greater
bandwidths for all operating bands to meet the IEEE 802.16m
specifications. It is easily found that 2.6/5.5GHz WiMAX operating
band can be easily excited by the proposed C-shape monopole strip.
And only the resonant mode close to 3.5GHz band can be excited as
the proposed compact monopole antenna with the inverted L-shape
parasitic strip. Therefore, the presented design criteria can meet the
prediction for the proposed monopole antenna described in Section 2.

distributions shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(c), respectively. Also, a null
point is observed along the excited current path (A → B → C) of the
resonant mode at 5.5GHz to introduce the overtone characteristics
in Fig. 3(c). However, as for 3.5GHz resonant mode, relatively
stronger excited surface current distribution along the inverted L-shape
parasitic strip (A → D → E → F) is illustrated in Fig. 3(b).

are listed in Table 2 as comparison. The simulated and measured
results show the satisfactory agreement for the proposed monopole
antenna design operating at each band. It can also be found that
when the length of L1 increases from 1mm to 4mm, the total length
of the surface current path (A → B → C) also increases from 31.5mm
to 34.5mm to make the 2.6/5.5GHz operating frequencies significantly
decreased. However, the operating frequencies near 3.5GHz band are
less varied as shown in Fig. 4(b). Effects of varying the length L2 of
the inverted L-shape parasitic strip are also studied. The measured
and simulated return loss for the length L2 varied from 14.1 to 15mm
is shown in Fig. 5 with the measured results listed in Table 3 as
comparison. It is found that the measured and simulated results have
the same variation trend for the proposed compact monopole antenna
design operating at each band. And, small effects on the antenna’s
low (WiMAX 2.6GHz) and high (WiMAX 5.5GHz) operating bands
are seen. However, the operating bandwidth of the middle (WiMAX

agreement is seen between the measured and simulated results. As
shown in Fig. 6(a), the antenna gain is varied from about 1.0 to
1.6 dBi and the radiation efficiency is about 79%–91% for 2.6GHz
WiMAX operation. Over the 3.5GHz band, the antenna gain is about
1.2–1.9 dBi with the radiation efficiency about 66%–96% as shown in
Fig. 6(b). And, from the results shown in Fig. 6(c), the antenna gain
is about 1.6–2.9 dBi and the radiation efficiency is about 84%–93%
over the 5.5GHz band. The measured two-dimensional (2-D) and
three-dimensional (3-D) radiation patterns at 2.6, 3.5 and 5.5GHz
are plotted in Fig. 7 with the simulated results as comparison. The
3-D radiation patterns show the total radiation power, while the 2-
D patterns plot the Eθ and Eφ components, separately. As seen in
the azimuthal plane (X-Y plane), there are generally good omni-
directional radiation pattern, which is advantageous and required
for WiMAX applications. Since the proposed antenna’s structure is
unsymmetrical with respect to the antenna axis (θ = 0), the 2D
radiation patterns in the Y Z plane are tilted probably due to the
surface current distribution concentrated in the — Y direction.
4. CONCLUSIONS
A novel planar compact C-shape monopole antenna with multi-band
operation for WiMAX system (IEEE 802.16m) has been proposed and
investigated. The obtained impedance bandwidth across the operating
bands can reach about 240/570/4470MHz for the 2.6/3.5/5.5GHz
bands, respectively. Only with the antenna size of 15× 30× 0.8mm3,
the proposed monopole antenna has the compact operation with more

printed dipole element is operated as a 0.5 wavelength 
antenna for the 2.4 GHz band in this design with the 
distance of 62.5 mm (~ 0.5 wavelength) between each 
individual element antenna. By introducing the T-shaped 
metal strip at the end of the ground plane to make the 
surface current distribution more uniform along the cen-
tral ground strip, the antenna gain will be enhanced with 
a good omni-directional radiation pattern in the azi-
muthal plane. The feeding network in the proposed array 
antenna is designed to have equal powers at the eight 
points (A ~ H), with the input impedance of 50 Ω  at the 
feeding point of each dipole element, which is simpler 
than the presented antenna designs [2, 4, 6].

To demonstrate the above deduction and guarantee 
the correctness of simulated results, the electromagnetic 
simulator HFSS based on the finite element method [7] 
has been applied for the proposed planar dipole array 
design. Fig. 3 shows the related simulated and 
experimental VSWR results for the proposed planar 
dipole array with various T-shaped ground strip’s 
dimensions. The related results are listed in Table 1 for 
comparison. The results show the satisfactory agreement 
for the proposed planar compact dipole array operating 
at the 2.4 GHz band. From the experimental results, the 
measured impedance bandwidth (VSWR≦1.5) can 
reach 12.6 % (302 MHz) for the 2.4 GHz band to 
provide more impedance bandwidth to meet the 
specifications of WiBro and WLAN systems. Owing to 
the excitation length of the T-shaped ground strip 
increasing to extend the surface current path, the 
resonant frequency of the proposed high-gain dipole 
array antenna decreases to obtain compact operation.

I. INTRODUCTION
D UE TO THE rapid developments of wireless communi-cation technology, especially the Worldwide Interoper-
ability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) applications covering
the bands of 2.6/3.5/5.5 GHz, multiband operation becomes de-
manding in practical applications for broadband access in wire-
less metropolitan area network (WMAN) environments. The
related monopole antenna (MA) designs for WiMAX applica-
tion have been presented by using inverted L-shaped MA [1],
rhomb-shaped MA with slits [2], inverted-F antenna [3], MA
with branch slits [4], MA with rectangular horizontal strips and
trapezoidal ground plane [5], mirrored-L monopole antenna [6],
asymmetric rectangular MA with additional strips [7], and a
planar rectangular MA connected with a circular disc by via
hole [8]. However, for these MAs, there is the disadvantage of
having a larger antenna size [2]–[4], [6] or complex antenna
structure [7]. Additionally, there is increasing demand for an-
tennas having more compact size to be suitably embedded in
the practical portable devices for the WiMAX (IEEE 802.16e)
system. Therefore, in this letter, we propose a novel planar dual
U-shaped monopole antenna for multiband WiMAX commu-
nication. From the related measured results, it provides a rela-
tively wider impedance bandwidth of 220/1660/1480 MHz for

J.-H. Lu and B.-J. Huang
A multi-band design of a planar inverted L-shaped monopole antenna
with an L-shaped parasitic strip for the WiMAX system is proposed.
With the use of L-shaped monopole and parasitic strips, multi-resonant
modes close to the 2.6/3.5/5.5 GHz bands are excited to meet the speci-
ﬁcations of the WiMAX system (IEEE 802.16e). Also, obtained impe-
dance bandwidth across the operating bands can reach about 270/1000/
1250 MHz for the 2.6/3.5/5.5 GHz bands, respectively. With a nearly
omnidirectional pattern in the xy-plane,measured peak gains and radiation
efﬁciencies are about 3.7/3.1/4.8 dBi and 68/80/84% at the 2.6/3.5/
5.5 GHz operating bands, respectively.
Introduction: In recent years, owing to rapid developments in wireless
communication technology, especially the Worldwide Interoperability
for Microwave Access (WiMAX) applications covering the bands of
2.6/3.5/5.5 GHz, multi-band operation becomes demanding in practical
applications for broadband access in the wireless metropolitan area
network (WMAN) environment. Related antenna designs have been pre-
sented using a monopole antenna [1–7]. However, there is the disadvan-
tage of large antenna size for the above monopole antennas, which are
unsuitably embedded in the practical portable devices for the WiMAX
(IEEE 802.16e) system. Therefore, in this Letter, we propose a novel
planar compact inverted L-shaped monopole antenna with an L-shaped
parasitic strip for multi-band WiMAX communication. From the related
measured results, it provides relatively wider impedance bandwidth of
270/1000/1250 MHz for the 2.6/3.5/5.5 GHz bands, respectively. The
proposed planar monopole antenna also provides omnidirectional radi-
ation patterns with maximum peak antenna gains of 3.7/3.1/4.8 dBi
and radiation efﬁciencies of 68/80/84% across the operating bands,
respectively. Details of the proposed monopole antenna design are
described, and experimental results for the obtained performance operated
across the 2.6/3.5/5.5 GHz operating bands are presented and discussed.

Antenna design and experimental results: To meet the multi-band
operation requirement for the WiMAX system, a planar inverted
L-shaped monopole antenna is proposed. Fig. 1 shows the geometry
of the proposed inverted L-shaped monopole antenna. A 50 V CPW
line is etched as the feeding structure on the inexpensive FR-4 substrate
with the antenna volume of 30 × 25 × 1.6 mm3, dielectric constant
e r ¼ 4.7 and loss tangent tan d ¼ 0.0245. The inverted L-shaped mono-
pole antenna is introduced to excite the fundamental and second modes
near the 2.6/5.5 GHz bands, respectively, in this study. Also, the para-
sitic L-shaped strip is used to excite the fundamental mode close to the
3.5 GHz band. First, the surface current length of the inverted L-shaped
strip is chosen to be approximately of 0.28 and 0.6 wavelength of the
2.6/5.5 GHz operating bands. The parasitic L-shaped strip is chosen
to be about 29.5 mm, corresponding approximately to the 0.34 wave-
length of the 3.5 GHz operating band. By properly adjusting the width
and gap of the CPW line, good impedance matching across the operating
bands can easily be obtained.

To demonstrate the above deduction and guarantee the correctness of
simulated results, the electromagnetic simulator HFSS based on the
ﬁnite element method [8] has been applied for the proposed monopole
antenna design. Fig. 2 shows the related simulated and experimental
results of return loss for the proposed inverted L-shaped monopole
antenna design of Fig. 1. Results show satisfactory agreement for the
proposed inverted L-shaped monopole antenna design operating at the
2.6/3.5/5.5 GHz bands. It is found that the resonant mode operated
close to the 3.5 GHz band can be easily excited for the proposed inverted
L-shaped monopole antenna with the parasitic L-shaped strip. From the
experimental results, the measured impedance bandwidth (VSWR % 2)

一、參加會議經過 
2010年亞太微波學術研討會 (2010 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference, APMC2010)
為一年一度在亞洲及大洋洲之各大主要城市輪流舉辦的國際研討會，今年由國際電機電子工
程師學會日本微波分會主辦，於十二月七日至十日在日本橫濱市舉行，極受到全球微波專長
的研究人員之重視，今年約有來自世界各地七百多位學者、專家及企業界代表參加，其中80%
以上是來自亞洲地區，投稿論文篇數為793篇，經嚴格審查後論文發表篇數為587篇，來自台
灣的優秀學者及工程師共投稿157篇，居亞洲第一，經過嚴格篩選(篩選率71%)後接受發表114
篇論文，排名晉升亞洲第二，亞洲各國對於此會皆相當重視，因此參加此會議不僅可以促進
學術交流而且增長見聞。舉辦方式與往年大致相同，由各國專家學者提出在微波電路及無線
通訊技術用天線設計的發展等研究方向上的最新發展情況，與來自全球各地之微波專長的研
究人員互相討論，以期使本世紀之電磁應用能更為成熟。 
筆者在本次研討會十二月十日下午張貼報告一篇論文，題目是“應用於WiMAX系統之平
面縮小化多頻U型單極天線 ”(Novel Design of Planar Multi-Band U-Shaped Monopole 
Antenna with Compact Operation for WiMAX Application)，此為國科會研究計畫成果，發表
會場約可容納150人，因此備覺受到尊重及肩負有強大的使命感，筆者發表時以流利的英語口
頭報告並回答與會學者所提出的問題。此外，國內尚有許多教授專家發表論文，整體表現都
相當不錯，均獲得與會者給予正面評價。 
除了參與論文研討外，此次為配合研討會舉行，日本微波分會特舉辦微波展示會，筆者
對於大會的儀器展及軟體展亦非常注意，都是近幾年才研發成功或改良型之硬體與軟體。因
此四天的會期過的相當忙碌且充實，同時大會並決定2011年亞太微波學術研討會將在澳洲墨
爾本市舉行。 
 
二、與會心得 
此次會議中頗有一些實用性與前瞻性的論文在研討會中發表，其中因平面天線具有重量
輕、體積小、價格低及低姿勢等優點，因此是近幾年相當熱門的研究主題，在此屆會議中天
線研究課題之發表論文佔32%，在本屆研討會排定的口頭報告議程中共有十二個場次，與會
者座無虛席，提出問題之專家學者相當踴躍，可見其受重視的程度。 
此次會議中頗有一些實用性與前瞻性的論文在研討會中發表，大致有兩項主題深受與會者
之重視。 
1. 微波積體化主動電路的設計 
由於微波頻段高、因此其積體化電路設計傾向於是最近幾年的研究課題，進而毫米波電路
設計(超過66 GHz以上)更是新穎的研究方向，在本屆會議中亞洲各國皆有相關的論文發表，
