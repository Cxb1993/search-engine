Abstract 
This paper utilizes the Field Programmable Gate 
Array (FPGA) and Nios II embedded processor 
technologies to design a controller IC for a 
micro-positioning Scott-Russell (SR) mechanism, which 
is driven by a piezoelectric actuator (PA). The analog to 
digital (A/D) and digital to analog (D/A) conversion 
circuits are important role to achieved the communicated 
objective with the FPGA. In system identification, the 
main objective is to identify the hysteresis effect of the 
piezoelectric element (PE), and shows its influence on 
the dynamic responses of the SR mechanism. The 
identification method based on real-coded genetic 
algorithm (RGA) has the advantages to identify the 
parameters of the SR mechanism and the Bouc-Wen 
hysteresis model simultaneously. For the controller 
design, the adaptive backstepping fuzzy control (ABFC) 
method is developed to achieve the motion control and 
the fuzzy logic method (FLM) is utilized to find the best 
adaptation gain of the adaptation law and control gain of 
the stabilization controls. This ABFC controller method 
can improve the transient and asymptotic tracking 
performances, and make the SR mechanism keep good 
working performance when external disturbances exist in 
the control system. Finally, we successfully apply the 
system-on-a-programmable-chip (SoPC) technologies to 
develop the motion controller IC, and achieve the 
advantages of reduce space, high performance and low 
cost.

1. Introduction 
There are many controller systems existing 
expensive problems, and it is seen fully digital controller 
of such systems has recently become possible with the 
advent Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chips. 
The advantages of the FPGA includes their 
programmable hard-wired feature, increasing system 
safety, shorter design time, embedding processor, low 
power consumption, low cost, less human resource 
requirements, and higher density for implementation of 
the digital system. There are many FPGA-based control 
systems for various motor devices [1] in the position and 
velocity controls. 
Nowadays, an embedded processor Nios II CPU 
and intellectual property (IP) design can be developed 
and downloaded into the FPGA to construct a 
system-on-a-programmable-chip (SoPC) environment, 
with the purpose of obtaining complete engineering 
solutions on a single integrated chip. In digital control 
systems, the majority of command input signals and 
sensor feedback are analog signals. Therefore, analog to 
digital (A/D) and digital to analog (D/A) conversion 
circuits play important roles in it. The purpose of this 
paper relies on the FPGA, SoPC technologies and 
external AD/DA conversion circuits to complete a digital 
system control. 
The PA has been extensively used in a micro/nano 
positioning system for high precision industries, and has 
the advantages: large force generation, high positioning 
precision about 10 pm to 100 mµ , fast-frequency 
response, small thermal expansion and high 
electrical-mechanical power conversion efficiency. Many 
authors [2] utilized the PA to high precision position 
controls, however, the PA has nonlinear hysteresis 
characteristics which makes difficult to precision 
positioning. In this paper, the SR mechanism is chosen to 
amplify the PA displacement and has the advantages: 
high precision, no friction, no hysteresis, no backlash, 
and possibility of monolithic manufacturing. The authors 
[3] utilized Taguchi method to optimize suitable 
structure sizes, and obtained a maximum amplification 
without loss the linear-motion output of the SR 
mechanism. 
 4 
values are given up, and the chromosomes having larger 
fitness values are left. Those left compose a new 
population, which may be better than the old. The RGA 
continuously searches the better chromosomes in this 
way until the converging index is satisfied.  
In this paper, the reproduction procedure adopts the 
roulette wheel selection. Arithmetic crossover operator 
and uniform mutation are used, and how to define the 
fitness function is the key point of the genetic algorithm 
since the fitness function is a figure of merit, which 
could be computed by using any domain knowledge. In 
this paper, the fitness function can be defined as:

          (2a) 
( ) *( )i i
iE x x= −                          (2b) 
where D  is a positive constant, n  is the total 
number of samples and iE  is the calculated error value 
of the ith sampling time. The *( )ix  is the solution by 
using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to solve Eqs. 
(1) with the parameters from the RGA method, and ( )ix  
is the value of the two conditions: (i) the solution 
calculated by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to 
solve Eqs. (1) with given parameters, (ii) the 
displacement measured experimentally at the ith 
sampling time. 
3. AD/DA Converter Circuits Design 
In designing the FPGA-based controller, the system 
needs proper operations by digital signals, which must be 
generated in FPGA internally and externally. The main 
purposes of AD/DA conversion circuits are to 
accomplish external analog signals being able to 
communicate with FPGA device. Therefore the AD/DA 
converters are essential parts for implementation in our 
motion control IC system.  
In this paper, data acquisition for the FPGA-based 
ABFC controller depends on an 8-bit parallel A/D 
(ADC0803) and D/A (DAC0800) converters. The 
ADC0803 has features of on-chip clock generator, 0V ~ 
5V analog input voltage range, and conversion time 
100 sµ . The DAC0800 has features of low power 
consumption: 33 mW  at 5V± , high output voltage: 
-10V to +10V, and fast settling times 100 ns . The 
AD/DA converter circuit is shown in Fig. 3, and it 
includes (1) two A/D coveters connecting external 
command input signal and feedback signal of gap sensor, 
(2) one D/A coveter for the proposed controller output 
communicating with external device, (3) one Operational 
Amplifier (OPA) IC satisfying the objective voltage, (4) 
one regulator IC (7805) offering 5V for LED devices on 
circuit board, and (5) various I/O pins connecting with 
external experimental instruments. 
4. The ABFC Controller Design 
In order to achieve high-precision positioning 
control of the SR mechanism actuated by a PA, the 
ABFC controller is utilized in this paper. The control 
objectives are to design the ABC control laws such the 
closed loop system is globally stable in sense that all 
signals are adjustable during the desired regulation and 
asymptotically tracking by a suitable choice of design 
parameters and achieve that 1lim ( ) ( ) 0t dx t x t→∞  − = , 
where ( )x t  denotes the output displacement, and 
1 ( )dx t  denotes the desired displacement trajectory of 
the SR mechanism. 
4.1 Approximation of hysteresis model 
The dynamic equations of the SR mechanism 
actuated by a PA with Bouc-Wen hysteresis model are 
shown in Eqs. (1). For convenience in the ABC 
controller design, the state variables are defined as 
follows: 
1 2 3 4, , ,x x x x x V x h=  =  =  =&                 (3) 
where 1x  and 2x  denote the displacement and 
velocity of the SR mechanism, respectively. 3x  denotes 
the input voltage to the mechanism, 4x  denotes the 
hysteresis variable, and dV V=&  denotes the rate change 
of the control input voltage. With the use of Eqs. (1) and 
Eq. (3), the mathematical model for the system can be 
derived as follows: 
1 2
2 1 2 3 4
3
4 3 3 4 3 4

=
= − − + −
=
= − −
&
&
&
& & & &
          (4) 
Unfortunately, the hysteresis variable 4x  in Eq. (3) 
is unavailable for the described system condition, 
because the nonlinear absolute function is present, and 
dynamics of 4x  exists an uncertainty for the 
mathematical model. Accurate measurement of the 
variable 4x  generally can obtain the high-performance 
control design. Hence, we utilize Taylor series expansion 
to express the state-space model with an approximation 
of variable 4x . We consider four conditions [6] as 
follows: 
Condition 1: 3 0x <&  and 4 0x < , 
4 3 3 4( )ex d x x xα β γ= + +& & &                      (5a) 
Condition 2: 3 0x >&  and 4 0x > , 
4 3 3 4( )ex d x x xα β γ= − +& & &                      (5b) 
Condition 3: 3 0x <&  and 4 0x > , 
4 3 3 4( )ex d x x xα β γ= + −& & &                      (5c) 
Condition 4: 3 0x >&  and 4 0x < , 
4 3 3 4( )ex d x x xα β γ= − −& & &                      (5d) 
Because Eqs. (5a-d) are similar, we will take Eq. (5a) 
and Eq. (5d) as examples for solving 4 ( )x t . Integrating 
both sides of Eq. (5a) and Eq. (5d) over 0 ,t t   , we 
obtain:

where 1c , 2c , and 3c  are proper positive

Finally, substituting Eqs. (21) into Eq. (19), and 
designing the corresponding adaptation law of the 
proposed ABC, we obtain:

    From Eq. (22) we can arrange the Lyapunov

3 2 2
ˆ ( )ed e p eφ= −

                       (24) 
where φ  denotes the adaptation gain. Substituting 
Eq. (24) into Eq. (23), we can obtain the following result: 
2 2 2
1 1 2 2 3 3 0L c e c e c e= − − − ≤&              (25) 
As a consequence, the control laws composed of 
Eqs. (21) and an adaptation law Eq. (24) for the ABC 
controller of the SR mechanism satisfy Lyapunov 
stability theorem. Moreover, if all the values of the 
control parameters are designed approximately, the 
asymptotical trajectory tracking for stability control and 
the improvement in the hysteresis behavior of the SR 
system can be completed. 
4.3 The fuzzy logic method 
Because the positive constant 1c , 2c , 3c , and φ  
of Eqs. (21) and Eq. (24) are assigned arbitrarily, we will 
the FLM to find their optimal values. The data 
manipulation is based on fuzzy set theory in the fuzzy 
inference mechanism, and the associated fuzzy sets 
involved in the fuzzy rules are defined as follows: 
NL: Negative Large NS: Negative Small ZE: Zero    
PS: Positive Small PM: Positive Middle PML: Positive 
Middle Large PL: Positive Large 
We select the initial fuzzy control rules by referring 
to if-than characteristics, such as: 
IF ie  is mA  and ie∆  is nB  THEN ‘gain’ is 
pC , i =1~3, m , n , p =1~5.                 (26) 
where the indices m , n , p  and i  are integer, 
mA  and nB  are relative states of fuzzy sets, and pC  
is the relative state of fuzzy rules. 
Since five fuzzy subsets, NL, NS, ZE, PS, and PL 
are defined for ie  and ie∆ , the fuzzy inference 
mechanism contains 25 rules, which are shown in Table 
1. It should be noted that PM and PML are employed. By 
using the centre-of-area method to defuzzy: 
‘gain’=

                          (27) 
where is  is the firing strength and ic  is the 
centre value of the i  rule. Then the defuzzy output of 
the ‘gain’ can be calculated. 
Figure 4 shows the block diagram of the ABFC 
controller, where 1dx  is the command input signal, 1x%  
is the output displacement of the SR mechanism, 2dx  
and 3dx  are the desired auxiliary stabilizing controls for 
2x%  and 3x% , respectively. 1e  is the error between 1x%  
and 1dx , and 1e∆  is its error change. φ  is the 
adaptation gain, and 1c , 2c , and 3c  are the stabilizing 
control gains. ˆd

%
 is the adaptation law, and dV%  is the 
control effort of the ABFC controller. The purpose of the 
ABFC controller is to make the system output 1x%  to 
track the command input signal 1dx , and the main 
feature is that the FLM is employed to obtain the optimal 
adaptation gain φ  and the stabilizing gains 1c , 2c , 
and 3c  of the ABC controller. The FLM application can 
be found in Reference [8]. 
5. Control IC Design on FPGA 
In this paper, the VHDL is utilized to arrange finite 
state machine (FSM) and design controller, where each 
step depends on a multiplier and an adder to accomplish 
the controller algorithm. As a result, we can reduce the 
system resource in a logic element by utilizing the 
FPGA.  
The internal architecture of the FPGA-based control 
system for the SR mechanism is shown in Fig. 5(a), and 
it contains two IPs, a Nios II processor IP and an 
application IP. The Nios II processor is used to deliver 
the command input 1dx  and to accept the variety signal 
from the FPGA. The program is written by C language. 
The application IP is implemented by VHDL, which 
includes system clk frequency divider, fuzzy control, 
adaptive backstepping controller, and the AD/DA 
interfaces. Two main parts of the FPGA-based controller 
IC design can be discussed as follows. 
5.1 Fuzzy control design 
The FPGA design procedure of the fuzzy control is 
shown in Fig. 5(b). The inference mechanism of the 
linguistic rules, 1w  to 25w , is obtained according to the 
min operator, which mainly consists of the comparator 
and mathematics equation as follows: 
( ) ( ){ }min , , min ,s s sw x x y y=                  (28) 
where s  is the serial number of each inference 
mechanism and  x and y  are the input values of ie  
and ie∆ , respectively. 
Finally, we can obtain the ‘gain’ value by utilizing 
the T-S type inference method associated with 1w  to 
25w  as the inputs. In this paper, defuzzification 
definition is different from the general ranges with 
 8 
accuracy of the system identification by the RGA 
method. 
Moreover, utilizing the identified parameters of 
experiments in Eqs. (1) and simulating the dynamic 
responses of the SR mechanism, Fig. 8(a) shows the 
experiment command input signal is decreasing sinusoid 
waveform, Fig. 8(b) compares the hysteresis loops 
between the experimental results and the identified 
values, and Fig. 8(c) shows the hysteresis error between 
them, and its smallest error about 0 15. mµ± . It is 
concluded that the RGA is used successfully identifying 
precision, good overall converging feature and identify 
the parameters of the SR mechanism and hysteresis 
Bouc-Wen model at the same time. The experimentally 
identified parameters with a good fitness value can make 
the dynamic response of the SR mechanism has the good 
agreement with the experimental results. 
6.3 The ABFC controller 
In this section, we compare numerical simulations 
with experimental results of various command input 
schemes. Here, the performance of the traditional ABC 
controller is compared with the proposed ABFC 
controller. The adaptation gain φ  and the stabilizing 
control gain 1c , 2c , and 3c  are selected for the ABC 
controller, but they are adjustable for the ABFC 
controller by the FLM. In order to obtain the comparison 
performance with the ABC controller, the parameters 1c , 
2c , and 3c , and the adaptation gain φ  are assigned as 
45, 0.1, 1.75, and 0.1, respectively. These values are 
determined from many tests of the ABC controller that 
can obtain a proper performance. In the impact force 
control, we knock the SR mechanism when the achieved 
steady-state condition, and only utilize the ABFC 
controller to the experiment. The numerical simulations 
and experimental results are shown as follows. 
6.3.1 The impulse tracking control 
In the impulse tracking problem, we select the 
command input with amplitude 20 mµ  and operating 
frequency 1 Hz. The results of the impulse tracking 
control for the ABC (0 to 1.5s) and ABFC (1.5 to 2.5s) 
controller are compared in Figs. 9(a-g). The numerical 
simulations and experimental results compared with the 
command input are shown in Fig. 9(a). The errors of the 
numerical simulations and experimental results with 
respect to the command input are shown in Fig. 9(b), 
where the steady-state error is about 0.091 mµ  and the 
converge time are about 0.5 sec in the ABC controller 
and about 0.2 sec in the ABFC controller. The control 
voltage dV%  are shown in Fig. 9(c), the adaptation gain 
φ  obtained by the FLM is shown in Fig. 9(d), and the 
stabilizing control gain 1c , 2c , and 3c  obtained by the 
FLM are shown in Figs. 9(e-g), respectively. It is 
concluded that while in the extension and shrink 
conditions of the SR mechanism, the steady-state errors 
are similar for both the ABC and ABFC controller, but 
the convergence time of the ABFC is shorten the ABC 
controller. 
6.3.2 The sinusoid tracking control 
In the sinusoid tracking problem, we select the 
command input is 10 10 sin 2  ft mpi µ+  , and the 
frequency is f = 0.5 Hz, 1 Hz, and 5 Hz. The sinusoid 
tracking results of the ABC (0 to 4s) and ABFC (4 to 8s) 
controller at 10 10 sin  t mpi µ+  are compared in Figs. 
10(a-h). The numerical simulations and experimental 
results compared with the command input are shown in 
Fig. 10(a). The errors of the numerical simulations and 
experimental results with respect to the command input 
are shown in Fig. 10(b), where the tracking error is about 
1 05. mµ±  in the ABC controller and about 0 18. mµ±  
in the ABFC controller. The control voltage dV%  are 
shown in Fig. 10(c), the adaptation gain φ  obtained by 
the FLM is shown in Fig. 10(d), the stabilizing control 
gain 1c , 2c , and 3c  obtained by the FLM are shown 
in Figs. 10(e-g), respectively, and the hysteresis 
phenomenon improved by using the ABFC is shown in 
Fig. 10(h).  
Figures 11(a-c) show the tracking errors for the 
numerical simulations and experimental results with 
respect to the command inputs: 10 10 sin  t mpi µ+ , 
10 10 sin 2  t mpi µ+  and 10 10 sin 10  t mpi µ+ . From the 
try-and-error experience, we obtain the stabilizing 
control gain 1c  is the key design parameter of the ABC 
controller. Here, we compare the sinusoid tracking error 
between 1 65c =  and 1 45c =  of the ABC controller, 
to illustrate the 1c  have large effect on the controller 
performance. From the sinusoid tracking results, we 
conclude that, (1) the ABFC controller can obtain a 
better transient performance, improve tracking error 
performance and can perfect achieve the hysteresis 
phenomenon improve, (2) the inference of the SR 
mechanism is suitable for the lower frequency control, 
and (3) the controller gain of the ABC controller will 
lead to large effect on the controller performance. This is 
the drawback of the ABC controller, so we utilize the 
FLM to develop the ABFC controller to remedy this 
problem. 
6.3.3 The impact force control 
When the impact forces are added on the SR 
mechanism, the comparison between the experimental 
result and the command input by using the ABFC 
controller is shown in Fig. 12(a). The errors between the 
experimental results and the command input are shown 
in Fig. 12(b). The control voltage dV%  is shown in Fig. 
12(c), and the adaptation gain φ  obtained by the FLM 
is shown in Fig. 12(d). It is seen when the impact forces 
are added on the SR mechanism, the ABFC controller 
keeps its good control performance. This can confirm 
that the proposed ABFC controller provides an excellent 
robustness property. 
7. Conclusion 
In this paper, we successfully apply the SoPC 
technique by use of the FPGA and Nios II processor to 
construct the FPGA-based micro-positioning controller 
IC for the motion control of the SR mechanism. In this 
paper, we can summarize the five-fold emphases: Firstly, 
the PA has a very limited extension range and exist the
