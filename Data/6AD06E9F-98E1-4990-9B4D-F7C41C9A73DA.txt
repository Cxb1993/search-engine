Abstract 
Friction Stir Welding (FSW) technology being applied to heavy manufacturing industry 
becomes a tendency. Especially, the weight reduction for overland and aquatic transportation 
machines is the great expectations for energy saving and CO2 reducing. Different heavy 
manufacturing industries need different materials’ joinable technologies for variable sizes of the 
workpieces. Most of FSW equipments are very expensive. The reliability of FSW depends on the 
mechanical properties in the welded zone. Therefore, the main objectives of this project are to weld 
two different FSW butt joints, i.e., the same based metal Aluminum Alloy AA6061 or AA5083. 
Furthermore, the quality of AA6061 butt joints for analysis of variance is evaluated by the ultimate 
tensile strength. The aluminum alloy AA5083 butt joints were for tensile test and TEM observation 
on stir zone. TEM field images show that the microstructures in the stir zone of AA5083 FSW joint 
were recrystallized grains in micron-meter order and submicron-meter order, and fund amorphous 
within stir zone of welds. Additionally, Digital Image Correlation (DIC) could be used to measure the 
material’s mechanical properties.  
The results from this project will produce one international conference paper and one national 
conference paper. Finally, the results are going to prepare and to submit to SCI/EI journals.  
Keywords: DIC, FSW, Aluminum Alloy, Microstructure.

1. Introduction 
The weight reduction for vehicles is the great expectations for energy saving and environmental 
preservation. Aluminum alloys will utilize and be helpful very much in some steel structure of 
vehicles to reduce their weight. Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a novel material joining technique 
invented in 1991, which can produce superior mechanical properties in the weld zone [1]. As 
 3
side of the welding sheet were defined according to the rotation of tool and the joint line. The 
insertion depth of pin into the workpieces was associated with the pin height (length). The tool 
shoulder contacting with the workpiece surface depends on the insertion depth of pin, which resulted 
in generation of welds with inner channel, surface groove, excessive flash or local thinning of the 
welded plates and so on. The FSW butt joints of AA6061 and AA5083 aluminum alloys are as shown 
in Fig. 1.  
In this work, there are four major controllable factors, i.e., two-level tool tilt angle (2, 3 degree), 
three-level rotation speed (1100, 1250, 1800 rev min-1), transverse speed (53, 90, 143 mm min-1) and 
pin tool length (2.7, 2.9, 3.1 mm) were chosen as shown in Table 1.  Each FSW butt joint was cut to 
be five pieces of specimens for tensile test based on ASTM standard. The tensile tests were carried 
out by Instron 8801 Universal Testing Machine, and taken their loading and elongation record of 
specimens. Finally, the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) as shown in Table 2 can be measured on the 
bases of their fracture loading of specimens, which is the data for AA6061 only. 
The AA5083 specimens for Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) were chosen from the 
cases of the ultimate tensile strength of FSW butt joint over 300 MPa, which is about 86% ultimate 
tensile strength of the base material. The TEM specimens were taken 1 mm thin piece from the 
welded zone of FSW butt joint along the transversal direction to the welding line, then ground by 
abrasive paper to 0.2 mm thin and thinner by ion miller. The micro-structural observation in the 
welded zone was taken by PHILIPS CM200 TEM with 200 kv.  
DIC was used to measure displacement for a cantilever beam under loading mechanical force. 
The size of the cantilever beam is 106.3×11.1×2.1 mm and being marked A, B, C, D and E points as 
shown in Fig. 2(a). Electronic Speckle-Pattern Interferometry (ESPI) was used to double check the 
beam displacement and its interference as shown in Fig. 2(b). In this research, one pixel is 15.15 μm 
for DIC measurement. The measurement range for horizontal/vertical displacement (du0/dv0) is 
between ±3.33 and ±166.67 μm and out-of-plane displacement (dw0) between ±9.75 and ±487.30 
μm. The size of taking image is 1.70×1.28 cm (i.e., 1024×768 pixels). In Fig. 2, the concentrated 
load is 0.294 N. The results comparison for the out-of-plane displacement of cantilever beam (or 
plate) measured by DIC and ESPI are as shown in Table 3. Then, mechanical properties, i.e. Stiffness 
( ijD ) can be obtained from the equation (1) when the out-of-plane displacement distribution (w) is 
measured as above expression. The governing equation with loading Q(x,y) is expressed as

3. Results and discussions 
The effect of FSW control parameters for the AA6061 ultimate tensile strength is as shown in Fig. 
3. The most significant factor is pin tool length. The effects of the control factors are in order of pin 
tool length, rotation speed, transverse speed, rotation speed and tool tilt angle. According to Fig. 3, 
the optimal FSW process parameters for ultimate tensile strength quality are the combination of the

is obtained when the out-of-plane displacement distribution is measured.  
4. Conclusions 
The medium pin tool length, higher transverse speed and rotation speed, which are the 
significant FSW process parameters, yield a higher AA6061 ultimate tensile strength. The tool tilt 
angle and rotation speed have serious interaction. The maximum tensile strength of the FSW joints is 
about 72% of the AA6061 base material. The specimens for TEM are chosen from the cases of the 
ultimate tensile strength of FSW AA5083 butt joint over 300 MPa and larger than 86% of the base 
material. TEM observation in the welded zone shows the structures of AA5083 aluminum alloy 
which are recrystallized grains after hot machining. The sizes of the most grains are around 0.5-3 μm. 
Small grains locate inside surrounding by large grains or beside the edge of the relatively large grains. 
The most of small grains are about 0.1-0.2 μm. The atoms disorder in the amorphous zone.
