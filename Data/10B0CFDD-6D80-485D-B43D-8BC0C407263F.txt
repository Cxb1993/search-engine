Abstract
Recursive clipping and filtering (RCF) is an efficient technique to reduce the peak to average
power ratio (PAPR) of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. But the error
performance is degraded while the number of recursion is increased. Recursive clipping and filtering
with Bounded Distortion (RCFBD) by restricting the distortion after each recursion of clipping
and filtering is proposed to alleviate the error degradation and keep the PAPR capability. The
quick convergence algorithm for RCFBD is proposed to reduce the iteration number while keeping
the PAPR gains are as similar as RCF and RCFBD. The generalized RCFBD applied to practical
OFDM systems are also considered.
Several selective-mapping (SLM) schemes which can reduce the PAPR in turbo coded OFDM
systems are also proposed in this project. The common feature of the proposed schemes is that
no side information is needed in the transmission. The waiver of side information can avoid the
degradation of error rate performance which results from the incorrect recovery of side information
at receiver in conventional SLM OFDM system. The candidates of one of the proposed SLM can be
respectively generated by a turbo encoder using various interleavers. For another proposed SLM, the
candidates are generated by respectively applying modulo 2 addition of distinct random sequences
to a given turbo codeword. The SLM turbo coding can be combined with the well-known active
constellation extension with smart gradient projection (ACE-SGP) algorithm to achieve great PAPR
reduction.

Introduction
OFDM is a multicarrier modulation technique for broadband communication, the advantage of which
includes its strong immunity to multipath fading, high spectral efficiency and easy compensation
for frequency-selective channel [1]. A well known problem for OFDM is the inherent high peak-to-
average power ratio (PAPR), due to its approximately Gaussian distributed waveform generated by
the summation of many subcarrier-modulated signals. An OFDM system with high PAPR requires a
costly linear power amplifier with large dynamic range for the transmitter. By now, many techniques
have been proposed for relieving the PAPR problem in the OFDM, which can be divided into two
classes, the distortion-based techniques and the redundancy-based techniques.
The distortion-based techniques reduce the PAPR of the OFDM symbol by changing the signal
points in the subcarriers. Direct clipping or peak windowing [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] simply suppresses the
time-domain OFDM signals of which the signal powers exceed a certain threshold. The penalty is the
significant out-of-band energy. To reduce the out-of-band energy, the recursive clipping and filtering
(RCF) [7] method, iteratively clips the time-domain OFDM signal and filters the out-of-band signal.
This technique will result in huge signal distortion and hence poor error performance. Estimation of
the clipped noise at the receiver [8] can be used to improve the error performance of direct clipping
or RCF. The active constellation extension (ACE) [9] method modifies RCF by allowing the signal
points at the edge of the constellation to be distorted in the direction away from the edge.
The redundancy-based technique includes coding, selective-mapping (SLM), partial transmit
sequences, tone reservation, and tone injection [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16], etc. For the redundancy-
based technique, the undesired effects occurring to the distortion techniques can be alleviated while
the penalty is the reduced transmission rates due to the introduction of redundancy. The basic idea
of SLM technique is to generate several OFDM symbols as candidates and then select the one with
the lowest PAPR for actual transmission. Conventionally, the transmission of side information is
needed so that the receiver can use the side information to tell which candidate is selected in the
transmission.
In this report, we first propose the recursive clipping and filtering with bounded distortion
(RCFBD) [17] method modifies ACE by allowing additional distortion for some signal points in
chapter 2. RCFBD can be seen as a tradeoff between ACE and RCF, it can get better BER
performance than RCF while the PAPR gain is similar. In chapter 3, more general OFDM scenarios
and fast convergence algorithm for RCFBD are proposed. In chapter 4, the redundancy-based SLM
without side information schemes [18, 19] are proposed to increase the data rate and alleviate the
error propagation caused by side information in the conventional SLM. Then the combination of
ACE-SGP is also proposed to achieve better PAPR gain. Conclusions are in the chapter 5.

both reduced average distortion and reduced error rates can be obtained as compared to RCF not
considering constellation shrinkage. For RCFBD, considering constellation shrinkage also yields
the reduced averaged distortion as compared to RCFBD not considering constellation shrinkage.
However, the reduced average distortion of RCFBD considering constellation shrinkage does not
necessarily result in the reduced error rate. Detailed statistics of the distortion will explain this
phenomenon. In modern communication applications, error control coding techniques are frequently
needed. In this chapter, the error performances of RCF and RCFBD are evaluated by considering
both uncoded and turbo-coded approaches.
In section 2.2, some basics about OFDM, PAPR reduction, and the operations of oversampled
clipping and filtering (OCF) are provided. Section 2.3 describes bounded distortion, the operations
of the proposed RCFBD. Complexity evaluation for RCFBD is given in section 2.4. The capability
of PAPR reduction and the associated distortion of RCF and RCFBD are evaluated in Section 2.5.
Section 2.6 presents the error performances of RCF and RCFBD. Concluding remarks are given in
section 2.7.
2.2 PAPR, OCF and RCF
Consider an OFDM system with N subcarriers. Each OFDM symbol (block) s(t), 0 ≤ t ≤ T , consists
of N complex baseband data X0, X1, · · · , XN−1 carried on N subcarriers for a symbol period of T .
The OFDM symbol s(t) is
s(t) =
1√
N
N−1∑
k=0
Xke
jk2pi∆ft, 0 ≤ t ≤ T (2.1)
where ∆f = 1/T is the subcarrier spacing and Xk is the complex baseband data carried on the k-th
subcarrier for s(t). For the OFDM symbol s(t), the peak instantaneous power is
Pmax(s(t)) = max
0≤t≤T
|s(t)|2. (2.2)
An OFDM symbol sequence can be represented by · · · , s(t), s(t + T ), · · · , s(t + mT ), · · · . We define
the average power of the OFDM symbol sequence following the approach in [6, 22] as
Pav(X0, X1, · · · , XN−1) = 1
N
N−1∑
k=0
E[|Xk|2] (2.3)
where E[|Xk|2] is the expected value of |Xk|2. The peak to average power ratio (PAPR) for symbol
s(t) is
PAPR(s(t)) =
Pmax(s(t))
Pav(X0, · · · , XN−1) (2.4)
Various data of X0, X1, · · · , XN−1 will result in different PAPR values. In the case that |Xk| is of
the same value for all k, the largest value of PAPR is N , which occurs when X0 = X1 = · · · = XN−1.
Since the OFDM symbol s(t) is the sum of N subcarrier-modulated signals, both the real part and
the imaginary part of the s(t) can be approximated by Gaussian distribution when N is large. That
means symbols with high PAPR arise occasionally.
OFDM systems are usually implemented by the inverse discrete Fourier transform(IDFT). Con-
sider the OFDM signal of (1) sampled at time instant n∆t, the associated discrete-time output is
6
?==========================================
The filtering operation will lead to peak power regrowth, i.e., the peak power after OCF,
Pmax(sˆL[n]) = max
0≤n<LN
|sˆL[n]|2 (2.12)
will be greater than A2 again. The average power following (2.3) now becomes
Pav(Xˆ0, · · · , XˆN−1) = 1N
∑N−1
k=0 E[|Xˆk|2]
= 1LN
∑LN−1
n=0 E[|sˆL[n]|2]
(2.13)
which is somewhat lower than the original Pav(X0, · · · , XN−1) due to the clipping and filtering
operation. To count the average power after clipping but including the out-of-band components, the
formula becomes
Pav(Xˆ0, · · · , XˆLN−1) = 1N
∑LN−1
k=0 E[|Xˆk|2]
= 1LN
∑LN−1
n=0 E[|g(sL[n])|2]
(2.14)
Since a single round of the clipping and filtering operation encounters the problem of peak power
regrowth, it was proposed in [7] to repeat the operation of OCF several rounds to suppress the peak
power regrowth. Such a method is called RCF in this chapter. We use RCF-J to denote RCF with
J recursions. The improvement of further PAPR reduction is very small for J beyond 3 in RCF.
For the OFDM system model considered in this chapter, there are two clipping processes. The
first is used for PAPR reduction by RCF or RCFBD and is called preclip , while the second is
called PA-clip(power amplifier clip) which is to simulate the nonlinearity of the power amplifier by
the soft limiter model. The thresholds of preclip and PA-clip are denoted A and Aa respectively.
Note that A can be different from Aa. In the meanwhile, there are two corresponding oversampling
factors L and La in this chapter. L = 2 is used in the preclip process since it can achieve effective
PAPR reduction with the least complexity compared to L > 2. La = 4 is used to approximate the
analog signal and the nonlinear behavior of the power amplifier in this chapter. Although larger La
can achieve more accurate results, La = 4 is commonly used to demonstrate the performances of
PAPR reduction methods [15, 24]. The clipping thresholds during the recursive process of RCF are
constant. However, the clipping thresholds during the recursive process of RCFBD may vary.
2.3 RCF with Bounded Distortion
In the technique of tone reservation [15], PAPR reduction is achieved by allowing arbitrary distortion
on some specific tones. Although tone reservation preserves the integrity of data tones(distortionless
approach), the PAPR reduction capability is limited if the number of reserved tones is not large
enough. When the power amplifier is operated at small backoff to get more power efficiency, the dis-
tortionless approach will still face clipping distortion due to insufficient PAPR reduction. While the
tone reservation technique restrict the unbounded distortion to only several tones, RCF spread the
distortion to all tones. RCF can therefore obtain large PAPR reduction capability. Since RCF allows
unbounded distortion on all tones, it is not surprising to see that RCF has poor error performances.
With this observation, we design an OFDM for which the associated distortion is bounded and spread
to all tones more evenly by the mechanism of bounded distortion(BD) control. Consider the scheme
of a single operation of OCF plus BD control( OCFBD) as shown in the dashed box of Fig. 2.2.
The input and output of OCF are (X0, X1, · · · , XN−1) and (Xˆ0, Xˆ1, · · · , XˆN−1) respectively. The
operation of the BD control has (Xˆ0, Xˆ1, · · · , XˆN−1) as input and output (X˜0, X˜1, · · · , X˜N−1), in
addition to the reference (X0, X1, · · · , XN−1) and the preset distortion bound δ. The goal of the
BD control is to adjust each Xˆk, k = 0, 1, · · · , N − 1, which comes from OCF operation, so that the

?==============================================
where γ is the criterion to determine whether the real part or imaginary part of a reference signal
point is on the edge of the M -QAM constellation or not. Note that for the M -QAM OFDM system,
in case that the real part a of the reference signal point is located on the boundary of the M -QAM
constellation and the real part aˆ of the distorted signal point Xˆk is outside the boundary and can
enhance the capability against noise as compared to the reference signal point, it is not required that
output a˜ be restricted in the region [a−δ, a+δ]. The release of the constraint for the imaginary part
is applied in the same manner and is independent of the real part processing. The desired region of
output signal points of BD control for the 16QAM constellation is shown in Fig. 2.3.
A single operation of OCFBD (OCF plus BD control) can not achieve satisfactory PAPR reduc-
tion and BER in general. We propose to repeat OCFBD operation several times like RCF. We call
such a scheme recursive clipping and filtering with bounded distortion (RCFBD). RCFBD operates
in a manner similar to RCF, while guaranteeing that the distortion be bounded and providing more
freedom in achieving PAPR reduction and low BER. The distortion bound and clipping threshold
used at the j-th recursion are denoted as δ(j) and A(j), 0 ≤ j < J respectively. The operation of
RBCDF-J is described as follows:
10
For those time-domain samples to be clipped, square root operation is needed to decide the ampli-
tude and scaling operation is needed to suppress the amplitude to the clipping level threshold. Since
only a small fraction of samples are clipped, the complexity of digital clipping is minor compared to
DFT. Besides, 2LN real number additions are needed for each bounded distortion control.
Hence, the total computational complexity is dominated by IDFT/DFT and each recursion of
RCFBD can be roughly estimated to be equal to the complexity of two LN -point DFT operations.
The recursion times, J , determines the total computational complexity of RCFBD, which is equiv-
alent to 2J DFT operations. In this chapter, we consider RCFBD-J , where J = 8 recursions are
used and oversampling factor L = 2 is used in the recursive process for PAPR reduction. Hence,
the complexity of PAPR reduction by RCFBD-8 is approximately equivalent to that of 16 DFT
operations.
2.5 PAPR Reduction and The Associated Distortion
2.5.1 PAPR Reduction Capability
Using either RCF or RCFBD, we can achieve significant PAPR reduction. The side effects of more
recursions are the decreased average power and the increased distortion. The effectiveness of PAPR
reduction can be measured by the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of peak
power and out-of-band power spectral density (PSD). Peak power CCDF and out-of-band PSD
for uncoded 16QAM/OFDM systems using RCF-J , J = 1, 2, 4, 8 and RCFBD-8 with δ = i · 0.1√
10
,
i = 3, 4, · · · , 8 are shown in Fig. 2.4 and Fig. 2.5 respectively, where the number of tones (subcarriers)
is 128. We consider a power amplifier with 3dB PA-clip which corresponds to 3dB power backoff
when the average power of the input signal to the power amplifier is 1. Hence, Aa = 1.413. For RCF,
the thresholds of both preclip and PA-clip are set to be equal, i.e., A = Aa = 1.413. For RCFBD-8,
varying distortion bounds and clipping thresholds described in (2.15) are used, where A = 1.413(3
dB), A(0) = 1.230 (1.8 dB), η = 4.0, β = 0.38,  = 0.75. We see that after 4 recursions, very good
PAPR reduction can be obtained for RCF by checking its out-of-band PSD. More than 4 recursions
of RCF will gain little improvement. For RCFBD, usually satisfactory PAPR reduction can not be
achieved for 4 or less recursions due to the constraint of the distortion of the data on subcarriers.
Hence, we only consider RCFBD with 8 recursions. For δ ≥ 0.6/√10, the PAPR reduction capability
of RCFBD is very close to that of RCF-8. In the figures, the curve denoted “Original” represents
the OFDM system which does not use any PAPR reduction technique but will go through the power
amplifier with 3 dB PA-clip.
We then consider turbo-coded 16QAM/OFDM systems with code rate 1/2 and 3/4 respectively
for which each codeword covers exactly one OFDM symbol. The associated PAPR capability re-
mains almost unchanged as compared to the uncoded case. We also consider the QPSK/OFDM
systems. The trend for the PAPR reduction capabilities of QPSK/OFDM is similar to that of the
16QAM/OFDM.
2.5.2 Constellation shrinkage and Average Distortion
Through the recursive clipping and filtering operations in RCF/RCFBD and clipping in PA-clip, the
average power on each tone will decrease while the average distortion will increase as the number of
recursions increases. More importantly, the references for evaluating the distortion or for detection
may need modification. Suppose that signal constellation of each subcarrier consists of M signal
points,V1, V2, · · · , VM . For example, M = 16 in a 16QAM constellation. Suppose that many OFDM
symbols are transmitted, the mean of all the distorted data which are originally mapped to Vi on a
certain subcarrier will be a shifted version (more precisely, a shrunk version ) of Vi. The phenomenon

The root-mean-square(RMS) value of the distortion on the k-th tone, devk is calculated as follows:

For the uncoded 128tone/16QAM OFDM systems with parameters specified in the previous
subsection, we find the average power and the average RMS distortion through simulation. For the
original case, RCF-J ,J = 1, 2, 4, 8, RCFBD-8(δ = i · 0.1√
10
, i = 3, 4, · · · , 8), the associated average
power are 0.865, 0.825, 0.810, 0.798, 0.794, 0.816, 0.799, 0.784, 0.775, 0.766 and 0.760 respectively.
The associated devx are 0.089, 0.111, 0.121, 0.129, 0.131, 0.118, 0.125, 0.131, 0.135, 0.138 and 0.139
respectively in case constellation shrinkage is not considered; and are 0.075, 0.094, 0.103, 0.110,
0.113, 0.103, 0.107, 0.110, 0.112, 0.113 and 0.113 respectively in case constellation shrinkage is
considered. The statistics for devy are close to those for devx. It can be easily observed that taking
the constellation shrinkage into account will effectively reduce the average distortion.
Note that devx of RCFBD is quite larger than that of RCF-1. This raises the question of the
advantage of using RCFBD. In fact, we need to investigate the average distortion of each tone.
Moreover, we exclude the helpful distortion from statistics, that means if the distorted signal has
the enhanced capability against the noise as compared to the reference signal point, the associated
distortion will be set to 0 in the statistics. Following (2.21), let Xmk = (a, b), X˘
m
k = (a˘, b˘). For
square M-QAM, γ =
√
M−2√
2(M−1)/3 , the algorithm to exclude the helpful distortion from statistics by
zero-forcing those distortion which move the edge signal points outwards is as follows:
?====== Excluding helpful distortion from statistics =============

if(a > γ & ∆xmk > 0) or (a < −γ & ∆xmk < 0)

?=============================================
After excluding the helpful distortion from statistics, we calculate the distortion ∆xmk , k = 0, 1, · · · , (N−
1), for the tones of the m-th randomly generated OFDM block and rearrange the tone index k in a
way such that ∆xm0 ≥ ∆xm1 ≥ · · · ≥ ∆xmN−1. With such ∆xmk for each of the B randomly generated
OFDM symbols(blocks), we can have devkx by using (2.23) for k = 0, 1, · · · , N − 1. Similarly, we can
have devky . Fig. 2.6 shows the orderly RMS real part distortion, dev
k
x, of RCF and RCFBD for the
uncoded 16QAM/128tone OFDM systems with parameters specified in the previous subsection(Aa
= A = 1.413(3 dB), A(0) = 1.230 (1.8 dB), η = 4.0, β = 0.38,  = 0.75). Only devkx of the first
64 tones are shown in Fig. 2.6 since devkx of the latter 64 tones is statistically symmetric to that of
14
such that the BER with a small δ at large Eb/No is poorer than that with a larger δ. For example,
Fig. 2.7 shows that when Eb/No is larger than 17dB, the BER for RCFBD with δ =
0.3√
10
is worse
than that with δ = 0.4√
10
; when Eb/No is larger than 19dB, the BER for RCFBD with δ =
0.4√
10
is
worse than that with δ = 0.5√
10
. As δ approaches zero, the effect of clipping and filtering will be
annihilated and hence the error performance of RCFBD will be close to that of the original case.
Judging from the PAPR reduction capability and the error performance, we find that δ = 0.4√
10
or
0.5√
10
is an appropriate choice for RCFBD to be applied to uncoded 16QAM/128tone OFDM systems.
2.6.2 turbo-coded cases
In modern communications, error control coding is usually needed. Although the distribution of
distortion for any of the original case, RCF and RCFBD may be much different from Gaussian, we
can still estimate the error performances of the coded 16QAM/128tone OFDM systems from that
of the corresponding uncoded OFDM systems given in Fig. 2.7. In case that powerful coding is
used such that the reliable communication(for example, BER ≤ 10−5) can be achieved at low SNR
(for example, Eb/N0 from 8 to 13 dB), RCF-1 and RCFBD with δ ≤ 0.4√10 will have similar error
performances and the original case will have better error performance. In case that moderately
powerful coding is used such that the reliable communication can be achieved at moderate to high
SNR (for example, Eb/N0 greater than 16 dB), RCFBD with δ ≤ 0.4√10 will have lower BER than the
original case and RCF-1. We conduct simulations for the coded 16QAM/128tone OFDM systems
using a rate 1/2 turbo code and a rate 3/4 turbo code respectively, of which each 512-bit codeword
covers an OFDM symbol, the generator polynomials are [1 + X + X2, 1 + X2](i.e. [1 5/7] recursive
systematic convolutional component encoder), and the number of zero-tail bits is 2. The interleaver
sizes for the rate 1/2 turbo code and the rate 3/4 turbo code are 256 bits and 384 bits respectively.
For space limitation, we do not provide the plots of the simulation results of rate 1/2 turbo-coded
OFDM. But we can summarize that in the case of rate 1/2 turbo-coded OFDM, all the curves of
RCF and RCFBD are very close and the Eb/N0 needed for achieving BER = 10
−5 is about 8 dB;
for the original case, the Eb/N0 needed for achieving BER = 10
−5 is about 7 dB; for the ideal
case, the Eb/N0 needed for achieving BER = 10
−5 is about 6.5 dB. The simulation results of the
rate 3/4 turbo-coded OFDM system are plotted in Fig. 2.9, from which we see that RCFBD with
δ ≤ 0.4√
10
have lower BER than that of the original case when the Eb/N0 is larger than 16dB. Hence,
the simulation results of the turbo-coded 16QAM/OFDM well fit our estimation using the uncoded
error performances.
2.7 Concluding Remarks
Recursive clipping and filtering(RCF) is an efficient technique to reduce the PAPR of OFDM system.
The drawback is the increased error rate which is due to the increased distortion resultant from the
operations of clipping and filtering. We propose to modify RCF by bounding the distortion after
each recursion of clipping and filtering. The modified RCF is called RCFBD. For RCFBD, severely
distorted signal points can be avoided although the average distortion can not be reduced. In this
chapter, we examine the performances of RCF/RCFBD applied to the 16QAM/128tone OFDM
systems. By 8 recursions, RCFBD can achieve very significant PAPR reduction as RCF does. In
the AWGN channel, RCFBD can have lower BER at moderate to high SNR and similar BER at
low SNR as compared to RCF. In the fading channels, the SNR may vary with time, we expect that
RCFBD will have superior error performances as compared to RCF. Due to space limitation, we only
present RCFBD based on 128tone/16QAM OFDM systems under 3dB PA-clip in detail. However,

block duration and ∆f = 1/T is the subcarrier spacing to achieve orthogonality. Xk are the com-

is a multiple of L). Henceforth, when the desired OFDM modulated signal is (3.1), zero-insertion
oversampled discrete-time signal is a more suitable representation of the continuous-time OFDM
signal than zero-padding oversampled one.
The operation of OCF in Chapter 2 can be applied to zero-insertion oversampled signal as
well( filtering out-of-band components by nulling the middle part of the frequency components).
The filtering operation removes the out-of-band components and gets length-N distorted baseband
sequence Xˆk. After OCF operation, the corresponding clipped time-domain signal sˆL[n] becomes
the LN -point IDFT of [Yˆ0, Yˆ1, · · · , YˆN

The operations of OCF, RCF, RCFBD described in Chapter 2 can be applied to zero-insertion
oversampled signal as well without any modification except that zero-padding is replaced by zero-
insertion and the frequency components to be filtered out.
3.3 Generalized RCFBD for various kinds of tones
In practical OFDM systems, pilot tones are commonly used to help channel estimation and some
null tones are left blank for future use. Tone reservation scheme [15] exclusively reserve some tones,
which are called peak-reduction tones(PRT) in [15], to reduce PAPR. We just call PRT as reserved
tones, also as unbounded tones in this chapter since there is no limitation for the signal imposed on
those tones. We consider an N -tone OFDM system and divide the N tones into three categories in
this chapter: data tones(bounded tones) to carry the information to be sent to the receiver, reserved
tones(unbounded tones) used exclusively to reduce PAPR, and protected tones which are required
to be kept integral, such as pilot tones, null tones etc.
24
The generalized RCFBD scheme implicitly utilizes the reserved tones to help reduce PAPR and
simultaneously preserves the integrity of protected tones. To compare with RCF scheme, we may
explicitly restore the distorted signals on protected tones to their original values during the recursive
process of RCF or can conceptually treat RCF as a special case of RCFBD with δkx = δky = ∞ for
k ∈ data tones or reserved tones and constant clipping threshold A(j) = A, for 0 ≤ j ≤ (J − 1).
3.4 Speedup of RCFBD
SGP(smart gradient projection), proposed in [9] for ACE, can be applied to RCFBD to speed up the
convergence of the recursive process. In fact, The extended region of ACE is identical to BD region
with δ = δkx = δky = 0. The speedup of SGP comes from the calculation of the suboptimal step
size µ and the incremental update structure. Readers may refer to [9] for the detail SGP algorithm
to calculate the suboptimal step size µ.
The incremental update structure means the update during each recursion is based on the dif-
ference between the previous signal and its clipped version rather than the initially given data. In
the following, we will transform BD and RCFBD in section 3.3 to the incremental update structure
shown in Fig. 3.1 in order to apply SGP more smoothly. We call this method RCFBD-SGP. The
algorithms of BD and RCFBD-SGP for the incremental update structure are as follows.
Incremental BD algorithm for Ωk
?===== K˜k = BD(Xk; Kk, δkx, δky, γkx, γky)==============
? Reference : Xk = (a, b) , (a, b) ∈ Ωk

∆˜x = sign(∆x)δkx;
else

if (| ∆y |≤ δky)
∆˜y = ∆y;
elseif
( (b > 0 and ∆y < 0) or (b < 0 and ∆y > 0) or (| b |< γky) )

? Reference of BD control: Xk, k = 0, 1, · · · , (N − 1)
? Number of Recursions: J
?==========================================
26
For RCFBD-SGP with δ = 0, equivalently, ACE-SGP, the output at each recursion always
falls within the desired regions, i.e., meets the constraint of distortion bound. But based on the
incremental structure, the resultant distortion for RCFBD-SGP with δkx and δky > 0 may not follow
the constraint of distortion bound for two reasons. The first is that the step size µj will magnify the
distortion. The second is that the distortion in the j-th recursion will be accumulated to the that in
the (j + 1)-th recursion via the update equation X
(j+1)
k = X
(j)
k + µj(K˜
(j)
k ), for 0 ≤ k ≤ N − 1. To
combat the distortion aggregation problem, we propose, as shown in the above algorithm, to pre-
scale the distortion bound applied in each recursion by the factor J · µmax, where µmax is chosen to
limit the step size got by SGP. That is, replacing < δkx,δky > by < δ
(j)
kx , δ
(j)
ky >=<
δkx
J·µmax ,
δky
J·µmax >
and if the step size got by SGP is larger than µmax, µmax is used instead.
3.5 Hybrid RCFBD
Though RCFBD-SGP can achieve convergence to low PAPR in three recursions, its PAPR reduction
improvement compared to ACE-SGP is rather limited due to the introduction of µmax. Because
SGP is of little effect if µmax is not large enough to allow the variation of µ for different input data
and recursions. On the other hand, if µmax is large, the allowed distortion bound at each recursion
become rather small and hence the effect of BD to gain PAPR reduction is diminished. Therefore, we
propose hybrid RCFBD schemes, which in general can allow combination of arbitrary µ(j), δ
(j)
kx , δ
(j)
ky
at each recursion j only if the aggregated distortion meets the target bound, i.e.
∑J−1
j=0 µjδ
(j)
kx ≤ δkx
and
∑J−1
j=0 µjδ
(j)
ky ≤ δky, where µ(j) may come from SGP or fixed value determined empirically for
various application scenarios.
For those applications which require fast process to reduce PAPR, say to achieve convergence in
three recursions, we propose special cases of hybrid RCFBD, (ACESGP-2 + RCFBD) and (ACESGP
+ RCFBD-2), which correspond to

where µ

SGP is the step size got by SGP at the j-th recursion, µmax is the empirically chosen fixed
value. Both (ACESGP-2 + RCFBD) and (ACESGP + RCFBD-2) can achieve promising PAPR
reduction quickly and provide more freedom to tradeoff BER. If only two recursions are allowed,
(ACESGP + RCFBD) can be used to get more PAPR reduction than ACESGP2. When µmax = 1,
RCFBD-1 is equivalent to OCFBD. SGP can be directly applied to RCF to get even lower PAPR
since there is no distortion constraint for RCF, however RCF-SGP will lead to severe distortion and
very poor BER.
3.6 Simulation Results and Discussions
The performance of a PAPR reduction technique for the OFDM system can be evaluated by the
complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of peak power, bit error rate (BER) and
out-of-band power spectral density (PSD). We present the simulation results for 128tone/16QAM
OFDM system in this chapter. The channel is assumed to be additive white gaussian noise(AWGN).
The signal constellations used for all data tones are the same and having unit symbol energy, i.e.
Ωk = Ω, Ek = 1 and δkx = δky = δ, γkx = γky =
2√
10
and for k ∈data tones. In the following figures,
the curve denoted “Original” represents the OFDM system which does not use any PAPR reduction
technique but will encounter PA-clip distortion; the curve denoted ”Ideal” stands for the OFDM
28
of reserved tones than RCF does.
3.7 Conclusions
In this chapter, we generalize RCFBD to apply it to practical OFDM systems consisting of many
types of tones such as data tones, pilot tones, null tones, reserved tones etc. We also generalize
RCFBD for the scenarios where different signal constellations are adopted on each tone such as
xDSL or OFDM systems with adaptive bit-loading.
We present the incremental update structure of RCFBD to apply SGP to get quick convergence
within 3 recursions. Simulation results of RCFBD-SGP illustrate that combination with dedicated
reserved tones to reduce PAPR can simultaneously achieve effective PAPR reduction, low out-of-
band PSD and approach the BER of the ideal case within 1dB. Inherited from RCFBD, RCFBD-SGP
keeps the advantages that the receiver does not need any change and neither the side information.
Hybrid schemes of RCFBD-SGP such as (ACESGP-(J-P) + RCFBD-P) which preserve both the
advantages of fast convergence of SGP and superior capability of PAPR reduction of RCFBD are
proposed. Comparison of the proposed method to RCF using IECNC is also given.

Chapter 4
Selective-mapping
4.1 Introduction
The basic idea of selective-mapping (SLM) technique is to generate several OFDM symbols as
candidates and then select the one with the lowest PAPR for actual transmission. Conventionally,
the transmission of side information is needed so that the receiver can use the side information to
tell which candidate is selected in the transmission.
In [26], the original data sequence is scrambled according to the side information and then
the scrambled sequence is protected by a coding scheme such as bit interleaved coded modulation
(BICM), where the side information appears explicitly in the scrambled sequence. The advantage
of the scheme in [26] is that no additional protection is needed for side information and the rate loss
due to the side information is small. However, once the side information is incorrectly decoded, the
the number of error bits in the erroneously decoded codeword can be great.
In this chapter, we propose several SLM schemes to reduce the PAPR of turbo coded OFDM,
where the transmission of side information is not needed. For one of the proposed SLM schemes,
the turbo encoder uses several distinct interleavers to generate distinct candidates for the selection
operations in the transmitter. For another SLM scheme, a given turbo codeword is added (modulo
2) by distinct random (test) sequences to generate distinct candidates. We use several maximum-
length sequences (m-sequences) as test sequences, where the length and period of m-sequences are
comparable to the length of turbo codeword. In addition, the combination of Hadamard sequences
and m-sequences can help reduce the computations needed in the inverse fast Fourier transform
(IFFT), while the PAPR reduction capability is not sacrificed. We also consider the combination of
the proposed SLM with ACE to achieve great PAPR reduction capability.
The receiver of each of our schemes uses the maximum a posterior probability (MAP) decoder
for the turbo code to calculate the reliability of each candidate. Although side information is not
available, the reliability of the decoded results will be high and the receiver can recover the correct
codeword in case that the candidate chosen by the receiver is correct. If the candidate is not the
one chosen by the transmitter, the reliability of the decoded results will be very low and the receiver
needs to try another candidate.
In section 4.2 of this chapter, we will provide some basics about the SLM techniques. Moreover,
in section 4.2, a SLM technique for turbo coded OFDM that needs side information will be described.
This SLM will be used for comparison with the SLM schemes without side information for turbo
coded OFDM which are proposed in section 4.3. In section 4.4, simulation results and performance
evaluation of the proposed designs are given. Comparison with ACE [9] is also provided. Concluding
remarks are given in section 4.5.
34
Finally, the sequence with the best metric (the lowest PAPR or the lowest PSPR) among the Q
output sequences, i.e., a¯1, a¯2, · · · , a¯Q is selected for transmission. In case of Q = 16, we randomly
choose sixteen sequences from the (127,7,64) maximum length code with period of 127 as t¯1, t¯2, · · · ,
t¯16.
For the receiver of scheme I, the turbo decoder yields (u¯′⊕ t¯′, s¯′ ). With the side information s¯′,
we can identify the associated m-sequence t¯′. By adding t¯′ to u¯′ ⊕ t¯′, we can obtain the estimated
message u¯′.
4.3 SLM without side information
In [26] or in scheme I, the side information is protected by the channel code. Once the side informa-
tion is decoded incorrectly, the whole message block will be in serious error. Hence, the incorrectly
decoded side information will significantly increase the bit error rate. In this section, we will pro-
pose several SLM turbo coded OFDM schemes that can reduce PAPR without the need of side
information.
4.3.1 Multiple Interleavers for Selective-Mapping
Consider a scheme, with transmitter shown in Fig. 4.2, where Q distinct interleavers for the turbo
encoder are used. We denote such a scheme as scheme II. For q = 1, 2, · · · , Q, the message sequence
u¯ is encoded by the turbo encoder using the q-th interleaver to yield a turbo coded sequence v¯q,
which is mapped to a sequence of signal points A¯q and is then converted into a¯q through the IFFT
operation. The Q interleavers are generated by the index mapping function [27]
Ω : cm → cm+1(mod L), 0 ≤ m < L (4.6)
where cm ≡ `m(m+1)2 (mod L), 0 ≤ m < L, L is the interleaver size and ` is an odd integer that
is variable. Various ` values can be used to generate various interleavers. Then, a¯p is selected for
transmission if a¯p has the best metric (e.g., the lowest PAPR or the lowest PSPR) among all the
a¯q, q ∈ {1, 2, · · · , Q}. The structure of the receiver is shown in Fig. 4.3, where the input a¯′p is the
sum of the transmitted vector a¯p and the Gaussian distributed noise. In case of turbo coding for
either binary or nonbinary modulation [28], the soft demodulation can be used to calculate the log-
likelihood ratio (LLR) for each code bit before the operation of the turbo decoding. Consider the
case of square QAM constellation Ω with Gray mapping [28], where the number of signal points in
Ω is M2 = 22g.
Suppose that the transmitter sends out A¯p = (Ap,0, Ap,1, . . . , , Ap,N−1), where for k = 0, 1, . . . , N−
1, Ap,k = ω(v
(Re)
p,k,1, · · · , v(Re)p,k,g, v(Im)p,k,1 , · · · , v(Im)p,k,g) ∈ Ω, and ω(v(Re)p,k,1, · · · , v(Re)p,k,g, v(Im)p,k,1 , · · · , v(Im)p,k,g)
represents the mapping from the binary 2g-tuple (v
(Re)
p,k,1, · · · , v(Re)p,k,g, v(Im)p,k,1 , · · · , v(Im)p,k,g) to Ω. The
g-tuple (v
(Re)
p,k,1, · · · , v(Re)p,k,g) will be used for the labelling of the real part of the constellation point and
the g-tuple (v
(Im)
p,k,1 , · · · , v(Im)p,k,g) will be used for the labelling of the imaginary part of the constellation
point.
At the receiving side, the signal vector a¯′p is converted into A¯
′
p = (A
′
p,0, A
′
p,1, . . . , A
′
p,N−1) through
the FFT operation, where for k = 0, · · · , N − 1, A′p,k = Ap,k + ηk and ηk is the complex noise with
Gaussian distribution of zero mean and variance σ2n for either the real part or the imaginary part.
The LLR for a code bit v mapped into Ap,k before the iterative turbo decoding is
∧(v) = Kc log

4.3.3 Combination of Maximum-Length Sequences and ACE-SGP
Active constellation extension (ACE) [9] is a well known PAPR reduction technique which does
not require extra redundancy. The operation of ACE for OFDM with square QAM modulation
containing M2 constellation points can be summarized as follows, where M = 2g.
1) Let Al = xl+jyl for l ∈ {0, · · · , N−1}, where j =
√−1 and xi, yi ∈ {−(M−1), · · · ,−3,−1, 1, 3, · · · , (M−
1)}. The oversampling factor is set to be f . Let A¯′ = A¯, where A¯=(A0, A1, · · · , AN−1, AN , · · · , AfN−1),
A¯′=(A′0, A
′
1, · · · , A′N−1, A′N , · · · , A′fN−1) and Al = A′l = 0 for l ∈ {N, · · · , fN − 1}.
2) Apply IFFT to the frequency-domain symbols A¯′ to obtain the time-domain symbol a¯′.
3) (Preclipping operation) Set a threshold Ψ on a˜. Clip a¯′ = (a′0, a
′
1, · · · , a′fN−1) to achieve a¯′′ =
(a′′0 , · · · , a′′fN−1), where [15]
a′′(n) =
{
a′(n), |a′(n)| ≤ Ψ
Ψejθ(n), |a′(n)| > Ψ (4.12)
and a′(n) = |a′(n)|ejθ(n) is the input signal and a′′(n) is the output signal.

Usually, many iterations are needed for ACE to achieve significant PAPR reduction. In [9], an
algorithm called smart gradient projection (SGP) was proposed to speed up the convergence for
the ACE. ACE-SGP can achieve good PAPR reduction capability and will be used for comparison
with the SLM schemes proposed in this chapter. In fact, the SLM schemes can be combined with
ACE-SGP to achieve further PAPR reduction. In this chapter, we only consider the combination of
scheme III with SGP, which will be denoted scheme IV. In particular, ACE-SGP-i (or scheme IV-i)
is the scheme ACE-SGP (or scheme IV) using i iterations in the PAPR reduction.
4.4 Simulation results and Performance Evaluation
We consider 256-subcarrier turbo coded OFDM over the AWGN channel for 16QAM modulation
with Gray mapping respectively. Perfect synchronization is assumed. For the turbo coded 16QAM
OFDM, we use a rate 1/2 binary turbo code of length 1024. The turbo encoder is formed by two
4-state recursive systematic convolutional (RSC) codes. Each rate 2/3 RSC code is obtained from
regularly puncturing the rate 1/2 RSC code using generators (1, 1+X+X
2
1+X2 ). In the simulation, we
use only one pre-iteration, i.e, S = 1 and the number of complete decoding iterations is I = 7. The
number of candidates is set to be Q = 16. In the transmitter end, we consider the power amplifier
with input power backoff (IBO) given by 5 dB, 6 dB and 7 dB respectively, where the power amplifier
is modelled by a soft limiter defined in (4.12). The oversampling factor f is set to 4. Simulation

4.5 Concluding Remarks
In this chapter, we propose several side-information free SLM type turbo coded OFDM schemes
for PAPR reduction. The reason that side information can be waived is due to the powerful dis-
criminating capability of turbo coding. Compared to turbo coded OFDM using side information,
the side-information free schemes have similar PAPR reduction capability and better error rates,
while require higher decoding complexity for the receiver. Compared to the well know ACE-SGP,
the proposed schemes have better error rates due to lower average power but have inferior PAPR
reduction capability and higher decoding complexity. The proposed schemes can be combined with
ACE-SGP to obtain very significant PAPR reduction.

Conclusions
Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is a popular modulation choice for digital trans-
missions. The occasional occurrence of high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) is a well-known
disadvantage of the OFDM systems. In this project, we propose the RCFBD to modify RCF by
bounding the distortion after each recursion of clipping and filtering. For RCFBD, severely distorted
signal points can be avoided and better BER performance are observed.
Then, the generalized RCFBD applied to practical OFDM systems consisting of many types
of tones such as data tones, pilot tones, null tones, reserved tones etc are considered. We also
generalize RCFBD for the scenarios where different signal constellations are adopted on each tone
such as xDSL or OFDM systems with adaptive bit-loading. The quick convergence algorithm for
RCFBD are proposed to reduce the iteration number within 3 iterations while the PAPR and BER
gains are remained.
The side-information free SLM type turbo coded OFDM schemes for PAPR reduction are pro-
posed, which employ the powerful discriminating capability of turbo coding. The side-information
free schemes have better error rates and similar PAPR reduction capability, while require higher
decoding complexity for the receiver. Compared to the well know ACE-SGP, the proposed schemes
have better error rates due to lower average power but have inferior PAPR reduction capability and
higher decoding complexity. The proposed schemes can be combined with ACE-SGP to obtain very
significant PAPR reduction.
