Abstract 
 
The effect of various frequencies of pulse current (PC) on the crystal orientation 
of copper deposit was investigated in this article. When PC frequency was lower than 
100 Hz, high (111)/(200) ratio after annealing was achieved and the amount of void 
defects was reduced after chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) process. In 
addition, the behaviors of additives depends on the pulse frequency were also studied 
and resulted in the different characteristics of copper deposits at various pulse 
frequencies. We therefore propose a modified deposition approach comprising direct 
current (DC) and PC which can reduce the void defects after CMP process based on 
the above experimental results.

waveform and annealing condition [17,23]. In particular, J. Oh et al. [22] reported that 
copper deposit plated by pulse current (PC) possesses much stronger (111) texture 
compared to that plated by direct current (DC) in the absence of additives.  
Until now, however, the influence of PC frequency on the crystal orientation of 
copper deposits is not well-known. Moreover, the information regarding PC 
performed in the plating bath with Cl-, PEG and SPS additives is even more lacking. 
In this study, we investigated the influence of pulse frequency on crystal orientation of 
copper deposit in plating with the above additives. In addition, the behaviors of 
additives at various pulse frequencies were also studied. Another objective in this 
study is to develop a plating scheme to obtain copper deposit with high (111) texture, 
which can reduce void defects after CMP process. 
 
Experimental 
In this study, four sets of experiments were carried out. The first set was copper 
deposition with DC or PC on blanket wafers. The second set was to simulate the 
corrosion resistance of copper deposits with DC or PC at various pulse frequencies by 
potentiodynamic measurement in the commercial slurry. The third set was to study the 
electrode kinetics by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and potential response with PC at 
various pulse frequencies. The fourth set was to perform the proposed plating scheme 
on pattern wafers and then process polishing.   
Deposition experiments were performed on blanket wafers, prepared by 
depositing a 30 nm sputtered TaN diffusion barrier layer and a 150 nm sputtered 
copper conduction layer on p-type silicon substrate with (100) orientation. A fragment 
of blanket wafer (3×3 cm2) was firstly mounted on the rotating disc electrode (RDE) 
adaptor, basically following the design reported by Taephaisitphongse et al. [24]. A 
copper foil was used as anode. The basic composition of the bath was 0.2 M

defects were only concerned in this paper.  
The electrochemical kinetics measurements were performed in a three-electrode 
cell. A platinum RDE (0.16 cm2) was used as working electrode along with a platinum 
counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) reference. The reference 
electrode was placed close to the working electrode to reduce the ohmic overpotential. 
Prior to the measurements of CV and potential responses during pulse plating, the 
working electrode was initially deposited with copper for 180 s in the predeposition 
bath, which contained 0.2 M CuSO4‧5H2O and 1 M H2SO4. At the end of 
measurement, the working electrode was transferred into the stripping bath, made up 
of H2O2/H2SO4=1/3 in volume ratio, to strip off the copper. The potential reported in 
this paper correspond to applied switching potential. All voltammetric experiments 
were performed at 1 mV/s and 500 rpm. As for measuring potential responses during 
pulse plating, the potential responses were stored through an analog output unit of an 
interface card (UEI PD2-MF-16-50/16H) in a personal computer. The maximum 
speed of the interface card was 50 k data s-1. To ensure steady-state plating, the 
potential responses were stored after plating for 1 min.  
To examine the performance of proposed plating scheme, pattern wafers were 
used in this experiment. First of all, the features were filled with different times to 
find when the current type should be switched from DC to PC. As switched time was 
determined, the proposed plating scheme was employed and then the copper deposits 
were annealed at 200  for 1 min. The annealed copper deposits were placed into the ℃
special carrier to carry out polishing experiment as mentioned above.

and (111) orientation is the closest-packed arrangement in fcc structure [16]. As for 
the fcc thin films, the (111) texture is favored by the surface and interfacial energy 
minimization, while the (200) texture is favored by the strain energy minimization 
[27]. The (200) texture facilitates the relaxation of strain energy, implying the (200) 
texture is conducive to relieve stress. Therefore, the growth of grains during annealing 
induces stress in the copper film in the tensile direction, and eventually changes the 
film into a state in which (111) texture is less favored energetically than (200) texture 
while film stress goes over the critical value [27].  
So our results indicate that DC or PC at high pulse frequency induce high stress, 
which leads to diminishing (111)/(200) ratio. Vainshtein et al. [28] have reported the 
(111) plane grows in a three-dimensional fashion while the (200) plane grows in two 
dimensions. Moreover, since (111) plane is the closest-packed arrangement in fcc 
structure, the chemical resistance of (111) plane is higher than other planes in fcc 
structure [16]. The potentiodynamic measurements were applied to inspect the 
correlation between (111)/(200) ratio and chemical resistance. Figure 3 shows the 
potentiodynamic polarization curves of copper films deposited with DC or PC at 
various pulse frequencies when immersed in the commercial CMP slurries. The 
results show the corrosion current densities at low frequency PC, 10 and 100 Hz, are 
low compared to those with DC and PC at high frequency. The behavior of corrosion 
current density is related to (111)/(200) ratio. In addition, the copper deposits with DC 
or PC at various pulse frequencies after annealing were polished by CMP. The defects 
were produced after the CMP process and the types of defects were detected and 
characterized by SEM. The correlation between the (111)/(200) ratio of copper films 
and the amount of void defects is summarized in Fig.4. Apparently, the copper films 
with high (111)/(200) ratio have strong chemical resistance against slurry corrosion 
and generate few amount of void defects.

increasing function of potential; voltammetric cycling indicates increase in the SPS 
surface coverage with higher current on the return sweep. In addition, the hysteresis in 
Fig.6 appears to be slightly reduced on the outward sweep; it may be explained by the 
addition of more Cl- through leakage from reference electrode. 
From the results of Fig.5, the on-time overpotential increased with decreasing 
pulse frequency. The results of Fig.6 indicates that more SPS adsorbed by displacing 
Cl- —Cu+ — PEG layer at low pulse frequencies, 10 or 100 Hz, compared with high 
pulse frequency, 10000 Hz, or DC due to possessing higher overpotential. 
Consequently, more desorption of Cl- and PEG took place in the on-time interval at 
low pulse frequency. Moreover, the desorbed Cl- and PEG may have better chance to 
depart from electrode surface in the off-time interval at low pulse frequency since the 
interval is relatively long and reaches about 50 ms at 10 Hz. It therefore suggests that 
re-adsorption of Cl- and PEG in the off-time interval at low pulse frequency may be 
less than that at high pulse frequency due to more SPS being adsorbed during the 
on-time interval.  
To examine the above reasoning regarding additive behaviors, SEM was applied 
to investigate the surface morphology of copper deposit at various pulse frequencies. 
Figure 7 shows the SEM images of copper deposit with PC at (a) 10 Hz, (b) 100 Hz, 
(c) 1000 Hz and (d) 10000 Hz and with (e) DC, where the applied average current 
density was 10 mA/cm2. The grains shown in Fig.7(a) and 7(b) are relatively small 
and Fig.7(c), 7(d) and 7(e) show large grains. Dow et al. [40] reported that 
fined-grained copper deposit was caused by the accelerator-dominant composition, 
SPS, and the coarse-grained copper deposit was derived from the 
suppressor-dominant composition, PEG+ JGB+ Cl-. Cabrielli et al. [41] also observed 
the addition of accelerator resulted in grain refinement, however, the suppressor 
leaded to large grain size. It implies that the copper deposit with large grains may
