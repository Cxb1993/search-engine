1. INTRODUCTION 
In wind engineering, the importance of bridge aero-elasticity is well recognized because it could 
potentially cause devastation.  It has drawn much attention on researches in the last few decades, 
among which the most important initiative of modeling such behavior was proposed by [Scanlan et 
al. (1971)] by introducing the idea of flutter derivatives.  Because of the bluff body nature on civil 
bridge sections, the flutter derivatives are usually determined by performing wind tunnel tests on 
section models.  The typical shortcomings by the conventional approach that basically uses free 
vibration technique include (1) the lack of consistency because of high sensitivity of free vibration 
responses to test condition/environment, and (2) the discrepancy inherently inherited by treating the 
free vibration frequency as the excitation frequency.  To overcome these, this paper presents a new 
approach for identifying flutter derivatives, with emphasis on the coupled ones, by using 
white-noise forced actuation technique. 
2. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND PERTINENT FORMULATION 
2.1 Equation of Bridge Motion Subjected to Smooth Wind Flow and Forced Actuation 
Consider a schematic diagram of the experimental setup shown in Fig. 1. Under smooth wind flow 
and forced actuation, the equations of motion can be expressed respectively as

were measured due solely to the forced excitation by assigning a white noise to  and

moment of inertia J can be identified by traditional calibration.  With the aid of knowing the 
values of J (or m), the values of , , ,  as well as ,  can thus be obtained.

Therefore, with the aero-elasticity incorporated, the frequency response function of h induced by h0 
can be given by

In the same manner, if the section model is subjected to the actuation of θ0 and wind flow, the 
frequency response function of θ due to θ0, ( )iωHθ/θ0 , can be obtained by following the same 
equations shown in Eqs. (11)-(13) except that h0 and h should be replaced by θ0 and θ; and H and 
Cq should be rewritten as [ ]4122 2020 x0Cq r c r k ll=  and [ ]T10=H , respectively.

Once iLθb  and iMhb  are determined, the flutter derivatives ( , ) and ( , ) can be 
computed by considering the imaginary and real parts accordingly, as shown in Eqs. (5) and (6).

3. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
For demonstration, the bridge deck of a chamfered plate with a 
width/depth ratio of 27, as shown in Fig. 2, was placed in a 
wind tunnel to conduct the identification. Wind tunnel tests at 4 
different wind velocities under white-noise actuation were performed.  Following the approach 
presented, the identified flutter derivatives ,  and ,  versus the reduced wind speed 
 (U ; f is the excitation frequency) are shown in Fig. 3 (a)-(d), respectively, in which the 
flutter derivatives from Theodorsen functions are also plotted for comparison.  Time history 
analysis was also simulated for verifying the identification results and the comparison with the
