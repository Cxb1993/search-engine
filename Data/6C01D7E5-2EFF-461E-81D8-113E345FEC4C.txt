reason of simplification. Although some research efforts
have been made by Hsuen [12, 13, 14] to develop
performance equations for a cathode or a single cell of
PEMFCs, all the results can be only applied for fully
hydrated condition. In fact, due to the change in the
water content of the ionomer phase of cathode catalyst
layer as operating current changes. The proton
conductivity of ionomer phase also changes, thus leading
to the variations of cell performance. The objective of
the present work is to develop a one-dimensional model
for a PEMFC cathode with variable degrees of external
humidification in cathode feed. The emphases are placed
on effects of the hydration degree of the ionomer phase
in the cathode catalyst layer and the degree of flooding in
the gas diffuser on the cathode performance. As stated,
the present model basically includes the discharging
characteristics of a PEMFC cathode from a partially dry
condition to a completely wet condition.
2. Mathematical model
The model considered in the present work is a
steady-state and isothermal one, which consists of a
cathode catalyst layer and a gas diffuser. The gas diffuser
is a porous composite made of electronically conductive
material such as carbon cloth or carbon paper. These
materials have been treated with PTFE or FEP so as to
enhance their hydrophobic properties. During operation,
a partially or fully humidified air stream is employed as a
cathode feed; thus three gaseous species, namely oxygen,
nitrogen, and water vapor exist in the pore volume of the
diffuser. The Stefan-Maxwell equations for
multi-component transport are usually a starting point for
the description of transport behavior of gaseous species
within the diffuser, which take the form

where eff
jiD  is an effective binary diffusion coefficient
in the porous medium for i and j species; Ni is the mole
flux of species i and xi its mole fraction. As a saturated
air stream is employed as a cathode feed, liquid water
would prevail over the gas diffuser. It is assumed that
phase equilibrium between the water vapor and its liquid
phase is achieved at each point of the gas diffuser if
liquid water exits. Also, the mole flux of nitrogen is
taken to be zero due to its inertness. Thus, the
Stefan-Maxwell equations stated above can be
condensed into one single equation as [1]

liquid phase become the only driving forces for water
flow. Thus, the liquid water flux, qw, is expressed as

If a partially saturated air stream is used as a
cathode feed, appearance of liquid water in the gas
diffuser depends on the degree of humidification in the
feeding air stream and the values of operating current
density. In general, two conditions might be encountered.
First, relatively dry (unsaturated) air is employed as a
feeding stream and the cathode is operated at low current
densities. Both factors might lead to insufficient amount
of water produced and only unsaturated water vapor
exists in the gas diffuser. Thus, Stefan-Maxwell
equations take the forms

The model developed in the preceding section was
employed to explore the performance of the cathodes of
fuel cells under the conditions of varying degrees of
external humidification. A highly humidified air stream
used for cathode feed certainly yields a larger value of
protonic conductivity of catalyst layer, thus giving rise to
a lower ohmic loss for the layer. However, at high
current densities, liquid water accumulated within gas
diffuser leads to a high value of diffusion overpotential
for the diffuser. On the other hand, a relatively dry feed
for the cathode deteriorates the cathode performance at
low current densities due to poor protonic conductivity.
Nevertheless, less liquid water is formed in the gas
diffuser at high current densities and thus a better
cathode performance is expected. Fig. 1 shows the
dependence of cathode potential on operating current
density for three cathodes operated under various degrees
of external humidification. The parameter values used in
calculation are listed in Table 1. It has been shown that
the cathode with relative humidity of 100% in the air
feed yields the best performance in low current densities
due to higher protonic conductivity of ionomer phase in
the catalyst layer. However, a much lower value of
limiting current density is found for this cathode because
of rapid accumulation of liquid water in its gas diffuser.
The cathode with 10% relative humidity yields the worst
performance in the region of low current density.
However, a much higher value of limiting current density
exists for this cathode due to a much lower degree of
liquid water accumulation in the gas diffuser. The results
shown in Fig. 2 are for three cathodes with the same
physical parameters as Fig. 1 except that the thickness of
catalyst is increased to 20m. For cathodes with thicker
catalyst layers, the effects of protonic conductivity of
ionomer phase will be magnified. As shown, the cathode
with 10% relative humidity yields lower output potential
than its counterpart in Fig. 1. It is also observed that the
values of limiting current density of these cathodes are
the same as those in Fig. 1 since these limiting values are
not influenced by the thickness of catalyst layer. Figs.
3-5 present the profiles of mole fractions of oxygen,
water vapor and water saturation within the gas diffuser
for the cathode with 50% relative humidity in Fig. 2 at
current density at 1, 1.4 and 2.14 A/cm2. As illustrated in
Fig. 4, there is no liquid water accumulated in the gas
diffuser, and consequently the water vapor within the
void space of the diffuser is under saturation. As the
operating current density is increased to 1.4 A/cm2,
liquid water appears in the region close to the interface
of the catalyst layer and gas diffuser and, as a result, the
water vapor in this region becomes saturated. As the
current density is continuously increased, the water front
moves towards the face of diffuser. Besides, a decrease
in oxygen concentration at the interface of catalyst layer
and gas diffuser is observed. At the limiting current
density (shown in Fig. 5), the oxygen concentration at
the interface of catalyst layer and gas diffuser becomes
zero and no further movement of water front is noted.
5. Conclusion
A two-phase model for cathodes of PEMFC was
developed in the present work. The effects of external
humidification on the cathode performance were
explored using the developed model. It has been shown
that the cathode with a lower value of relative
humidification in air feed yields a higher potential loss at
lower current densities due to poor protonic conductivity
of ionomer phase in the catalyst layer. Nevertheless, a
greater value of limiting current density is noted because
of less severity of liquid water accumulation in the gas
diffuser. Therefore, optimal operating conditions lie in
the intermediate region of external humidification.
