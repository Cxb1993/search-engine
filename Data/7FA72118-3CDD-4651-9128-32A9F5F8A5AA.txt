Abstract  
There have been recent interests in 
applying multi-carrier modulation tech- 
niques for providing frequency diversity in 
the next-generation wireless communication 
systems. In the first year of this project, we 
proposed the two-dimensional (2-D) non- 
orthogonal codes to support more sub- 
scribers and simultaneous users in single 
rate multi-carrier direct-sequence code-divi- 
sion multiple-access (MC/DS-CDMA) sys- 
tems. However, in order to support variable- 
rate services in multi-carrier systems, the 
multi-rate MC/DS-CDMA system with the 
use of 2-D orthogonal variable spreading 
factor (OVSF) codes is proposed in this 
project. The proposed 2-D OVSF codes 
have the flexibility of varying the sequence 
length in order to meet various data-rate 
requirements and orthogonality is still 
preserved among different spreading factors 
in the code tree. Moreover, the performance 
of the proposed scheme using equal-gain 
combining (EGC) reception method is 
analyzed. Our results show that the proposed 
scheme is more suitable for supporting 
multi-rate, multimedia services in a non- 
fading additive white Gaussian noise 
channel or a Rician fading channel. 
Therefore, the proposed scheme will prove 
useful in the success of design and de- 
ployment of future wireless communication 
systems with multimedia services. 
Keywords:  Code division multiple access, 
multi-carrier, multi-rate, two-dimensional 
orthogonal variable spreading factor code.

Kronecker product of two matrices, such 
that lqnm CA ×× ⊗  is an mq×nl matrix. 
Any two matrices with different 
spreading factors (i.e., at different layers) 
but with the same α  are also orthogonal 
unless one of them is a “mother” matrix of 
the other. That is, a matrix is said to be a 
“mother” of the other matrices in a code set 
if they (so-called “children”) originate from 
that matrix. For example in Fig. 1, if a code 
matrix is assigned to a user, the mother or 
child matrices of that code set cannot be 
assigned to another user in order to maintain 
code orthogonality. 
III. System Model 
To show how multi-rate transmissions 
in MC/DS-CDMA systems can be achieved 
by using the variable-length technique with 
our 2-D OVSF codes, we use Fig. 2, in 
which )1( 3216×C  and
)7(
168×C  of Fig. 1 are assigned 
to the transmitters of users 1 and 2, 
respectively. Since user 1 has a matrix size 
of 16 × 32 and user 2 has a matrix size of 8 
× 16, user 2 can transmit twice the number 
of data bits with half the number of carriers 
of user 1. Thus, the data rate of user 2 is 
doubled and the code matrix assigned to 
user 2 can also be assigned to another same 
rate user by utilizing the other half of the 
carriers. From the code tree in Fig. 1, twelve 
code matrices can be used without 
destroying orthogonality in different layers 
if four 8×16 code matrices are assigned for 
double-rate transmissions and eight 16×32 
code matrices are assigned for basic-rate 
transmissions. In fact, the system can 
support four more double-rate users by 
sharing the four 8 × 16 code matrices with 
different carriers, supporting a total of 
sixteen users. Let us consider a multi-carrier 
DS-CDMA system with Q different data 
rates. The data-bit streams at different rates 
are modulated by the spreading code 
matrices of different lengths extracted from 
our OVSF code tree. For example, in the 
code tree of Fig. 1, we have =cT

(or so-called processing gain) of the rate-2q 
users, respectively. 1N is the basic-rate 
processing gain and .2

All rates are assumed to be integral 
multiples of the basic rate. As the number of 
carriers reduces with the matrix length, the 
rate-2 users use only half of the carriers of 
the basic-rate users, the rate-4 users use a 
quarter of the carriers, and so on. Thus, the 
received multi-rate MC/DS-CDMA signal at 
a receiver is given by

D. Performance Comparisons 
In the following, we assume that the 
same average power P is used for all users 
and there only exist two data rates in 
transmission. That is, a basic data rate Rb is 
assumed for lower-rate (LR) services and a 
rate 2Rb is for higher-rate (HR) services. The 
total number of simultaneous users is fixed 
to 16 (i.e., HR+LR=16) and the total number 
of available carriers is also 16. The code 
matrices of the LR and HR users are of sizes 
16×64 and 8×32, respectively. An empirical 
study indicated that the value of R = 10 dB 
was typical in modeling the indoor radio 
channel amplitude fluctuation [13]. Fig. 3 
shows the average BEP Pe versus the 
input-energy-per-bit-to-noise-energy ratio 
0ηbE  under an AWGN nonfading channel. 
The symbols in Fig. 3 (i.e., crosses, circles, 
etc.) represent the results from computer 
simulations and the curve comes from the 
corresponding Pe equation derived in 
Section IV-A. The legend, for example, 
“HR=10, LR=6, HR” means that there are 
10 higher-rate users and 6 lower-rate users, 
and the higher-rate users’ performance is 
analyzed. As shown in the figure, the 
performances of the LR and HR users are 
almost identical, independent of the code 
length. It is because the 2-D OVSF codes 
are orthogonal and the code orthogonality 
cannot be destroyed by a non-fading channel. 
The argument of longer code length adding 
more diversities is not applicable in this case 
because of no MAI created by the 2-D 
OVSF codes.  
Figs. 4 and 5 show the average BEP Pe 
versus the input-energy-per-bit-to-noise- 
energy ratio 0ηbE  under a Rician fading 
channel with R = 10 dB and with the equal 
gain combining (EGC) reception method. 
The symbols in Figs. 4 and 5 (i.e., circles 
and pluses) represent the results from 
computer simulations and the curves come 
from the corresponding Pe equations derived 
in Section IV-B. The 2-D OVSF codes are 
effective in the Rician channel because the 
fading effect is weak and the code ortho- 
gonality is mostly preserved. As seen from

of length N = p1p2 · · · pk and weight w ≤ p1, where “pl”
denotes a modulo-pl multiplication for l = {1, 2, 3, . . . , k}.
For ease of representation, every matrix in 2-D codes can
equivalently be written as a set of w ordered pairs (i.e., one
ordered pair for every binary one), where an ordered pair
(λv, th) records the vertical (v) and horizontal (h) displace-
ments of a binary one from the bottom-leftmost corner of
a matrix. In other words, λv represents the transmitting
wavelength and th shows the time position of a binary one
in the matrix.
It is important to point out that this construction is dif-
ferent from that of [5] and, thus, requires a modiﬁcation in
the performance analysis in Section III.
These p1N code matrices can be separated into p1 groups
of N matrices per group. The autocorrelation sidelobes of
any matrices in the code set are always zero. Code matrices
coming from diﬀerent groups (i.e., diﬀerent j values) have
the cross-correlation functions of at most two (i.e., λc = 2).
However, code matrices coming from the same group (i.e.,

the same j value) have the cross-correlation functions of at
most one (i.e., λ′c = 1).
This group property comes from the fact that the j =
0 group of matrices in (1) corresponds to the N original
matrices of our λc = 1 CHPC [3, Section 2.6], and that the
j = {1, 2, . . . , p1} groups of matrices in (2) are obtained
by inserting the QC operator, i2 · j (mod p1), in every
ordered pairs of (1), where i ∈ GF (p1). Since the linear
equation in the CHPC is now replaced by the quadratic
equation, the maximum cross-correlation function for any
two distinct matrices, xi1,i2,...,ik,j and xi′1,i′2,...,i′k,j′ , in the
(w × N,w, 0, 2, 1) QC-CHPC is at most two (i.e., λc =
2) if the index j = j′. For the matrices in the same j
group, the cross-correlation functions are at most one (i.e.,
λ′c = 1) from the fact that the cross-correlation functions
of the CHPC are at most one [3, Section 2.6]. To see that
the autocorrelation sidelobes are always zero, we note that
all of the binary ones in each code matrix are in diﬀerent
wavelengths.
Using k = 1, p1 = N = 5, and w = 4 as an example,
this (4× 5, 4, 0, 2, 1) QC-CHPC has 5 groups of 5 matrices,
xi1,j (for i1 ∈ [0, 4] and j ∈ [0, 4]), as shown in Table I.
Matrices with the same j value have λ′c = 1, but matrices
with diﬀerent j values have λc = 2. For example, the
matrices x0,1, x1,1, x2,1, x3,1, and x4,1 in the j = 1 group,
will have at most two hits (per time slot) with x1,0, but at
most one hit (per time slot) among themselves.
III. Performance Analysis of the QC-CHPC in
Multicode Keying
In general, the code performance in OOK wavelength-
time O-CDMA is determined by the cross-correlation func-
tions, which are related to code weight, code length, and
the number of available wavelengths [3]. With multicode
keying in use, the code performance now depends on the
intersymbol cross-correlation functions (i.e., λc) generated
by the code matrices of interfering users and the intrasym-
bol cross-correlation functions (i.e., λ′c) generated by self

M = {2, 4, 8, 16}, k = 1, and p1 = N = 101× log2 M.
Now, we consider the k > 1 case. The analysis is very
similar to that of the k = 1 case, except that the in-
trasymbol cross-correlation functions all become zero (i.e.,
λ′c = 0). The analysis follows (3)–(7), but the term P
′
r(z)
is now not needed because λ′c = 0, as shown in the ap-
pendix. Since the probability of choosing the correct de-
coder is 1/(1 + t), the bit error probability is given by

For comparison, the hard-limiting bit error probability of
the (w×N,w, 0, 2, 1) QC-CHPC in the conventional OOK
wavelength-time O-CDMA is given by [9, eq. (16)], such

In OOK, a factor of 1/2 is needed on the right sides of both
(4) and (5) because data bit ones and zeros are assumed
with equal probability and bit zeros are not transmitted.
Figs. 1 and 2 compare the bit error probabilities
of the (w × N,w, 0, 2, 1) QC-CHPC in OOK [i.e., (11)]
and multicode-keying [i.e., (9)] wavelength-time O-CDMA,
where w = 7, k = 1, and M = {2, 4, 8, 16}. Also in Fig. 1,
we assume that p1 = N = 101× log2 M in order to keep
the bit rate constant so that the relationship between bit
error probability and M can be investigated. We assume
p1 = N = 317 × log2 M in Fig. 2 so that the eﬀect of

code length to the bit error probability can also be studied
when both ﬁgures are compared.
In general, the bit error probability improves when M
or code length N increases. When M increases, there are
more data bits to be decided incorrectly if a symbol detec-
tion error occurs. However, the increase in code length (i.e.,
N ∝ log2 M) provides a stronger compensation. The net
eﬀect is the improvement of bit error probability as M in-
creases when the data bit rate is kept constant. The bit
error probability of the M = 2 case is the worst and even
worse than that of the OOK case because the amount of
MAI in the latter is reduced by half, in average, as data
bit zeros are not transmitted. In these numerical exam-
ples, it is interest to see that we need to use M = 8 in
order to catch up with the OOK case in terms of bit error
probability.
In summary, our results show that there is a trade-oﬀ
between the bit error probability and the choice of M , for
a given data bit rate. To improve bit error probability and
enhance user’s code obscurity, the numbers of decoders in-
creases linearly with M . On the other hand, the required
hardware speed can be reduced by a factor of m, as the
number of the hardware increases with M . For example,
we can use 2.5-GHz hardware to support a data bit rate
of 10 Gbit/s when M = 16 is used, but then 16 decoders
per user are needed. In other words, multicode keying pro-
vides an option of trading hardware speed for hardware
complexity. If code obscurity is not important, one should
use OOK for hardware simplicity. If bit error probability
is more important, one should use as large M as possible.
In our numerical examples, the choice of M = 8 provides
a good compromise among bit error probability, hardware
