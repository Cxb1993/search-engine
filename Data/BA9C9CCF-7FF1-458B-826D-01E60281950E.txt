Results and discussion 
As shown in Scheme 1, 1,4-bis(3,4-dicarboxyphenoxy)benzene dianhydride (3a; mp 270-271 oC, 
72% yield) and 1,3-bis(3,4-dicarboxyphenoxy)benzene dianhydride (3b; mp 169-170 oC, 65% 
yield) were synthesized starting from the nitro-displacement reaction of 4-nitrophthalodinitrile 
with hydroquinone and resorcinol, respectively, in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) in the 
presence of potassium carbonate as the base, followed by the alkaline hydrolysis of the 
intermediate bis(ether dinitrile)s (1a, mp 261-262 oC, 80% yield; 1b, mp 186-187 oC, 75% yield) 
and the cyclodehydration of the resulting bis(ether diacid)s (2a, 92% yield; 2b, 87% yield). The 
spectroscopy (Fig.1-3) of the intermediate tetranitriles and tetracarboxylic acids and the target 
bis(ether anhydride)s are listed as follows. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Two series of novel fluorinated polyimides (5a-g and 6a-g) with an isomeric repeat unit were 
synthesized by a two-step procedure in which poly(amic acid)s (PAAs) were first prepared by 
ring-opening polyaddition of bis(ether anhydride)s 3a and 3b, respectively, with various 
CF3-bearing bis(ether amine)s 4aeg in DMAc, followed by the thermal and chemical imidization 
of PAA (Scheme 2). No difficulty was encountered in obtaining high molecular weight PAAs 
from the reactions of 4a-g with 3a or 3b. Despite the amino groups in these bis(ether amine)s 
were less basic than a normal dramatic amine because of the inductive deactivation of the -CF3 
group, these CF3-substituted bis(ether amine)s were still sufficiently reactive to give high 
molecular weight poly(amic acid)s when they were allowed to polymerize for an extended period 
of time (ca. 10 h). The maintained reactivity of these bis(ether amine)s is most likely based on the 
meta substitution to the amino group. Tough and flexible polyimide films were obtained by 
casting the PAA solution on glass substrate followed by thermal curing process up to 250 oC. All 
the chemically treated polyimides exhibited good solubility in organic solvents; therefore, the 
characterization of solution viscosity was carried out without any difficulty. As shown in Table 1, 
the inherent viscosities of these polyimides were in the range of 0.43-0.79 dL/g that corresponded 
to weight-average and number-average molecular weights of 22,000-44,000 and 17,000-25,000, 
respectively, relative to the polystyrene standards.

trifluoromethyl groups, which inhibited close packing and reduced the chainechain interactions 
leading to an enhanced solubility. Thus, all the 5 and 6 series polyimides could be easily 
processed from solutions. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Transmission UV-vis spectra were measured for the thin films of all polyimides. Typical 
UV-vis spectra of some representative polyimide films are illustrated in Fig. 6. All fluorinated 
polyimide films exhibited cut-off wavelengths shorter than 400 nm and were entirely transparent 
and colorless. As shown in Table 3, the 5(C) and 6(C) polyimides showed a very low yellowness 
index (b*) of 6.2-9.4. The slightly higher yellowness index of the thermally imidized PEI films 
might be a result of thermal oxidation of chain-end amino groups. All the polyimides containing  
 6
from commercially available aromatic dianhydrides with a non-fluorinated bis(ether amine) 4’a 
are also given in Table 3. The films of common polyimidesPMDA/4’a and BTDA/4’a appeared 
with a deep yellow color and revealed a relatively high b* value above 80. The ODPA/4’a 
polyimide was pale yellow in color and showed a lowered b* value of 30.4. In contrast to these 
conventional polyimides, the film of 6’a(H) showed a very low b* value of 18.3 comparable to 
that of Ultem film. Thus, it seems to be that the dianhydride structure is more influential in 
determining the color intensity of polyimides than the diamine structure. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  The tensile properties of the polyimide films are reported in Table 4. These polymer films 
showed similar type of behavior with respect to the elastic deformation range at small strains. 
The 5 and 6 series polyimides showed tensile strengths at break of 80-103 MPa, elongations at 
break of 6-17%, and initial moduli of 1.8-2.3 GPa. The tensile properties of the 5 series 
polyimides are comparable with those of the 5’ series analogs. These results indicate that the 
incorporation of the CF3 group into the structure of polyimides not only improves solubility but 
also retains the good mechanical properties. All these polymer films possess good tensile 
properties indicating that they are strong materials.

isomeric 6 series polyimides which contain m-phenylene ring in the dianhydride segment. In 
comparison with the analogs 5’ and 6’ series, the 5 and 6 series exhibited lower Tg values due to 
the reduced interchain CT interaction and packing efficiency produced by the pendent eCF3 
groups. 
 
   
  The thermal stability of the polyimides was studied by thermogravimetic analysis (TGA). 
Typical TGA thermograms of polymers 6b and 6’b are shown in Fig. 7. The temperatures at a 
10% weight loss (T10) in nitrogen and air atmospheres were determined from original TGA 
curves. The T10 values of the 5 series in nitrogen and air stayed within 487-559 oC and 492-545 
oC, and for the 6 series within 487-553 oC and 485-544 oC. Most of them left more than 50% char 
yield at 800 oC in nitrogen. It is quite reasonable that the methylsubstituted polyimides like 5e 
and 6e began to decompose at lower temperatures compared with the unsubstituted 5d and 6d. 
The TGA data indicated that these fluorinated polyimides had fairly high thermal stability 
regardless of the introduction of the CF3 groups. 
  The dielectric constants and water uptakes of all the polyimides are reported in Table 6. For 
comparison, the data of a standard polyimide film from pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) and 
4,4’-oxydianiline (ODA) are also included in Table 6. The 5 and 6 series polyimides exhibited 
the dielectric constants at 1 MHz in the range of 3.05-3.49 and 2.79-3.20, respectively, which are 
lower than the corresponding non-fluorinated polyimides and the standard PMDA/ODA 
polyimide. The decreased dielectric constants could be explained by the attribution of the bulky 
-CF3 substituents in the polymer backbone, which has low polarizability and increase the free 
volume of the polymer chain. Polyimides 5g and 6g exhibited the lowest dielectric constants in

higher transparency than the isomeric 2,6-substituted IIIA series. In comparison with 
non-fluorinated poly (ether imide)s, the fluorinated IIIA and IIIB series showed better solubility, 
higher transparency, and lower dielectric constants and water absorption.

Title: Thermally Stable, Organosoluble, and Colorless Poly(ether imide)s Having Ortho-Linked 
Aromatic Units in the Main Chain and Trifluoromethyl Pendent Groups 
 
Abstract: A novel series of aromatic poly(ether imide)s (PEIs) IVa–h containing ortho-linked 
aromatic units and pendent trifluoromethyl (CF3) groups were prepared from 
2,3-bis(3,4-dicarboxyphenoxy)naphthalene dianhydride (I) with various CF3-substituted aromatic 
bis(ether amine)s via a conventional two-stage process including ringopening polyaddition to 
form the poly(amic acid)s followed by either chemical or thermal imidization to the PEIs. The 
inherent viscosities of PEIs IVa–h were in the range of 0.43–0.86 dL/g that corresponded to 
weight-average and number-average molecular weights (by gel permeation chromatography) of 
36 000–73 000 and 23 000–51 000, respectively. All the IV series were highly soluble in several 
organic solvents and could be solution-cast into transparent, flexible, and strong films. These 
films were essentially colorless; their cut-off wavelengths were between 368 and 377 nm and a 
very low b* value (a yellowness index) ranging from 4.1 to 5.5. They had useful levels of thermal 
stability associated with moderately high-glass transition temperatures (208–281 oC), 10% 
weight-loss temperatures in excess of 492 oC, and char yields at 800 oC in nitrogen higher than 
51%. They also showed low water uptakes of 0.25–0.48% and low dielectric constants of 
3.06–3.67 at 10 kHz. For a comparative study, a series of structurally similar, non-fluorinated 
PEIs Va–h from dianhydride I and bis(ether amine)s II’a–h were also prepared and 
characterized.

Title: Novel organosoluble and colorless poly(ether imide)s  based on 
1,1-bis[4-(3,4-dicarboxyphenoxy)phenyl]cyclohexane dianhydride and 
trifluoromethyl-substituted aromatic bis(ether amine)s 
 
Abstract: A series of novel fluorinated poly(ether imide)s (IV) having inherent viscosities of 
0.70–1.08 dL/g were prepared from 1,1-bis[4-(3,4-dicarboxyphenoxy)phenyl]cyclohexane 
dianhydride and various trifluoromethyl (CF3)-substituted aromatic bis(ether amine)s by a 
standard two-step process with thermal and chemical imidization of poly(amic acid) precursors. 
These poly(ether imide)s showed excellent solubility in many organic solvents and could be 
solution-cast into transparent, flexible, and tough films. These films were essentially colorless, 
with an ultraviolet-visible absorption edge of 375–380 nm and a very low b* value (a yellowness 
 16
11–25%, initial modulus of 1.5–2.0 GPa. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of IIIa-h were in 
the range of 202–267 oC, and the decomposition temperature above 493 oC and left 40–65% char 
yield at 800 oC in nitrogen. They had the lower dielectric constants of 3.39–3.72 (1 MHz) and 
moisture absorptions in the range of 0.11–0.40%.

Title: Organo-soluble and Lightly-colored Fluorinated Polyimides Based on 
2,2-Bis[4-(3,4-dicarboxyphenoxy)phenyl]hexafluoropropane Dianhydride  and Aromatic 
Bis(ether amine)s Bearing Pendent Trifluoromethyl Groups  
 
Abstract:  Two series of soluble and light-colored poly(ether imide)s (III and IV) were 
synthesized from 2,2-bis[4-(3,4-dicarboxyphenoxyl)phenyl]hexafluoropropane dianhydride and 
various fluorinated and non-fluorinated aromatic diamines by a conventional two-step procedure 
that included a ring-opening polyaddition to give poly(amic acid)s, followed by chemical 
cyclodehydration to poly(ether imide)s. The III series were lighter-colored and higher optical 
transparency as compared with the non-fluorinated IV series. On comparing the IV series with 
the common lightly-colored aromatic polyimides (V series) based on 
2,2-bis(3,4-dicarboxyphenyl)hexafluoropropane dianhydride (6FDA), the IV series revealed less 
colored than the V series. This indicated that both the III and IV series were lightly-colored 
poly(ether imide)s. These polymer films showed the cutoff wavelength in the range of 364–371 
nm. The III series showed good solubility in all testing solvents at a concentration of 5–10 wt/v% 
and most of IV series was soluble. These polymers exhibited glass-transition temperatures in the 
range of 194–264 oC, and the 10% weight-loss temperatures were higher than 492 oC under either 
nitrogen or air atmosphere. The III series also showed lower dielectric constants of 3.01–3.65 at 
1MHz and lower moisture absorption of 0.09–0.44 wt% than IV series.
