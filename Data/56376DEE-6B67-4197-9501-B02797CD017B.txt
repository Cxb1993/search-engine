Rouse time of one entanglement length. 
This observation was in agreement with an 
early study exploiting theory/data 
comparisons for a series of entangled 
solutions. No results have been reported for 
optical measurements, for support to this 
part of research was not approved by NSC. 
Nevertheless, a static/dynamic light 
scattering measuring system is currently 
being set up for related studies in the near 
future.

II. Background 
The rheology of entangled polymers are 
well described by the classic reptation 
theory1,2, along with several subsequent 
refinements. The success of the DE theory 
in describing the linear viscoelastic 
properties has been deemed as important 
evidence of the effect of topological 
constraint on linear chain relaxation in an 
entangled system. The impact of topological 
constraint on nonlinear chain relaxation has 
not been as well perceived, however. 
Recently, for the case of nonlinear 
chain-length relaxation, Wen and Hua3 have 
solved the exact solution of the original 
Rouse model for dilute solution4,

defined in ref. 2. 
In order to retrieve the information of 
segmental stretch as noted above, it is 
essential to assume that the linear and the 
nonlinear stress relaxations are uncoupled. 
In this way, 2( )tλ  after t1 can in principle 
be retrieved using Eq. (3). The results are 
compared with Eq. (2) for single-step strain 
flows, as shown in Fig. 5. It can be seen that 
in non-reversing double-step strain flows 
variation of  does not alter the chain 
retraction behavior for the case 
1t
1 2( , ) (0.5,7)γ γ = . Moreover, the previously 
retrieved values of 2( )tλ  are  almost 
indistinguishable from that for 7γ =  in 
single-step strain experiment (not shown 
here). On the basis of these observations, it 
appears that the deformation history of 
imposing first a small 1γ  followed by a 
non-reversing large step strain 2γ  at 
different imposition times for  has little 
influence on the subsequent chain 
stretch/retraction properties of the test fluid. 
Namely, the entanglement density 
immediately after a small 
1t
1γ  is nearly 
identical to that at equilibrium. 
Now, consider the case of two 
successive large step strains imposed on the 
same sample fluid (i.e., 1 2 7γ γ= = ). It is 
likely that the effect of entanglement loss 
becomes important due to a large 1γ  in the 
forgoing deformation history. Specifically, it 
is expected that a lower number of 
entanglements per chain that survives the 
first strain could lead to a less degree of 
chain stretch upon the imposition of the 
second strain. Such a trend is indeed 
observed in Fig. 5, where the values of 
2( )tλ  following 2 7γ =  systematically 
deviate from those predicted by Eq. (2), as 
 is gradually decreased from 8.4, 2.6 to 
0.84 s. In conclusion, we may tentatively 
interpret the current results as evidence of 
entanglement loss, persisting only for 
several Rouse times, induced by a large 
1t
1γ . 
Of course, for a larger time interval 
( ), chain stretch/retraction behavior 
similar to what observed in the previous 
deformation history, i.e., 
1 ~ 8.4 st
1 2( , ) (0.5,7)γ γ = , 
is noted again.

aggregation properties of MEH-PPV solutions. It is of interest to note, however, that 
the exact solvent qualities for commonly studied MEH-PPV solution systems have 
never been reported, and, in particular, their impact on the supramolecular 
aggregation properties remains largely unexplored. An important reason for this is 
that the solvent quality of a polymer solution has typically been evaluated from 
single-chain (such as the coil size) or associated solution (such as the intrinsic 
viscosity) properties, yet a great tendency for MEH-PPV chains to form aggregates in 
essentially all solvents known prevents related data from being obtained in practice. 
These observations have motivated the present simulation study, which, in turn, was 
encouraged by the recent advance in coarse-grained (CG) simulations, as we briefly 
introduce below. 
Recently, there has been a significant proliferation of researches taking advantage 
of CG models and simulation schemes to gain insights into the structural and even 
dynamic features in complex fluid systems.14-29 In general, a CG model is established 
on the basis of the easily accessible, yet computationally more expensive, atomistic 
model and its molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Essential information obtained 
from an atomistic MD simulation usually includes the Boltzmann trajectories of 
properly re-defined bond lengths or angles16 as well as the radial distribution 
functions (RDFs) for the particles in the CG model. The previous MD data can, in 
 10
In this work, we propose a CG model and a self-consistent (without using freely 
adjustable parameters) Langevin dynamics scheme that allow one to capture the 
structural and the dynamic properties of a polymer solution in a substantially more 
efficient way than usual MD simulations of a CG model. Consequently, universal 
single-chain properties that are, in general, difficult to obtain using usual CG 
simulations may be directly studied; in addition, access is also allowed for the 
associated supramolecular aggregation properties. Although the proposed scheme is 
believed to be applicable to a wider variety of polymer solution systems, we here 
focus on the application for MEH-PPV solutions. We show that, for the first time, the 
exact solvent qualities of the investigated solution systems can be evaluated from the 
simulation. In addition, preliminary simulation results on the supramolecular 
aggregation properties are also obtained and utilized to interpret the general 
observations from a wide range of recent experimental characterizations.      
This article is organized in the following way: In Section 2, we summarize the 
essential chemical and physical features of the MEH-PPV molecule as well as its 
phenomenological aggregation properties in solution. In Section 3, we discuss the 
construction of a CG model and a self-consistent Langevin dynamics scheme for 
simulating MEH-PPV in two distinct solvent systems (i.e., aromatic or aliphatic). In 
Section 4, simulation results on both single-chain and supramolecular aggregation 
 12
The most typical way to control the aggregation properties in solution is to make 
use of different solvents. For the case of a MEH-PPV monomer, which consists of an 
aromatic backbone and two alkoxy side chains, it is clear that different parts of the 
molecule bear quite distinct affinities to specific types of solvents. It is, therefore, of 
interest to understand how the resultant single-chain and aggregation properties would, 
in general, be affected by the use of a particular type of solvent. In experiment, the 
aggregation properties of conjugated polymer solutions or films were typically studied 
on the basis of spectroscopic analyses, such as UV-vis adsorption and PL. Although 
such analyses are sensitive enough to local material properties, the detailed 
single-chain or aggregation state underlying the spectroscopic features of the solution 
is difficult to know in general. Other experimental protocols which probe the 
aggregation properties at larger scales, such as viscometric or light-scattering 
characterizations, suffer from similar restrictions in resolving the detailed structural 
features.     
Current attempts to understand the molecular properties of MEH-PPV may be 
grossly depicted in Figure 2, where early simulations and experimental 
characterizations are catalogued according to the relevant length/time scales probed. 
In particular, the marked portion represents the molecular scales aimed to be captured 
in this simulation. It can be seen that the material properties studied here are of 
 14
constructing a CG model for MEH-PPV, we here adopt a more simplified CG model, 
Model II, for the following reasons: For a MEH-PPV chain as long as currently 
studied (i.e., n 80,000M ≈  Da or 300 monomers per chain), localπ π− interactions 
become increasingly less dominant due to a globally random chain conformation. In 
fact, the current CG model will be demonstrated to be capable of capturing essential 
material properties of MEH-PPV in two representative solvent systems as implied by 
recent experimental observations or simulation results. Investigation based on a 
different CG model for mixed solvent systems is left to a future work. In what follows, 
we describe how the simulation results based on Model I may be utilized to 
reconstruct the force fields and the Langevin dynamics for the CG model, Model II, 
which will be employed to compute all the single-chain and aggregation properties 
presented in this work. 
 
3. Model Construction and Simulation Protocol 
The MD simulation of Model I was carried out using usual Newton’s equations of 
motion. The calculations were performed in a supercomputer with four CPUs running 
in parallel; an existing software package DLPOLY230 and incorporated force fields 
were used.31 The simulation results were mainly utilized to provide essential statistical 
trajectories for the bond length or angles as re-defined in the CG model (i.e., Model 
 16
Similarly, the intermolecular potential for nonbonded beads in the CG model may 
be constructed using the radial distribution function (RDF) obtained for Model I:

r rρ π= Δ ,                                     
(2) 
where ( )n r  is the mean number of particles lying within the shell defined by the 
radial distances r  and r r+ Δ , respectively, and ρ  is the bulk number density. In 
this case, the solvent molecules are modeled as single particles, as is the case with the 
polymer monomer. Note, however, that since the RDF so obtained is strictly a 
consequence of many-body interactions, the corresponding Boltzamann inversion 
does not necessarily yield the real pair interactions, unless the system remains 
sufficiently dilute and noninteracting. Using the inverted function as a first guess, an 
iterative procedure can nevertheless be adopted to find an effective pair interaction 
potential that best describes the RDF given.16,22 Thus, optimal Lennard-Jones 
potential functions (see a detailed specification of model parameters in Table I) were 
chosen to mimic nonbonded potentials for the CG model. Comparisons of the 
predicted RDFs from two different simulations are provided in Figure 4.  
To this end, usual MD simulations of the CG model have been carried out to 
provide the comparisons shown above. For most of the subsequent analyses, however, 
we consider a different approach which bears an obvious advantage of being

to estimate the frictional drag coefficient, iς , using the predicted particle diffusivity,

  (4) 
In Eq. (4), the brackets denote taking the ensemble average of the quantity within 
them, I  is a unit tensor, and ijδ  is the Kronecker delta function.  
Several things must be noted here. Firstly, although the polymer particle described 
in the CG model might not be treated as a usual Brownian particle, whose mass 
should be sufficiently larger than those of surrounding solvent particles, it will be 
shown that the Einstein relation and the Brownian forces so constructed seem to lead 
to results in good agreement with what directly obtained from the MD simulation of 
the CG model. On the other hand, the commonly employed extension—the 
Einstein-Stokes law—which involves using the bulk solvent viscosity to estimate the 
particle diffusivities, fails evidently in the current level of coarse-graining, as might 
be expected. Note also that it has not been uncommon using similar Langevin 
dynamic equations to simulate polymer solution or melt systems at a similar level of 
 20
single MEH-PPV chain in two different solvent systems. Moreover, for the results 
shown in Table II, it takes ca. 36 hrs of the MD simulation with four CPUs running in 
parallel, while it requires only about ten minutes for the Langevin dynamics 
simulation executed in a single-CPU personal computer. In fact, only through the 
Langevin dynamics simulation will it be possible for us to investigate polymer chain 
lengths close to what typically studied in real experiment, and, in particular, to gain 
some insight into the properties of supramolecular aggregates formed by several 
MEH-PPV chains of comparable lengths.   
In simulating Eq. (3), the Velocity Verlet algorithm33 was used with a time step 7.5 
fs (see a later discussion). As usually done, periodic boundary conditions were applied 
in all three spatial directions. Initially, a Monte Carlo scheme33,34 was used to create 
independent MEH-PPV chains with minimum configuration energies. Each chain was 
further equilibrated for a number of steps ca. 53 10× . For the results reported in the 
next section, the simulated MEH-PPV chain typically consists of 300 monomers per 
chain (or n 80,000M ≈  Da), which falls in the regime of the sample molecular 
weights as typically investigated in experiments.9,11    
Before closing the introduction of the simulation protocol, we would like to add 
some further remarks.  In the spirit of the proposed Langevin dynamics scheme, the 
effect of solvent quality might be regarded as being self-consistently accounted for via 
 22
Figure 5 shows representative realization of a single MEH-PPV chain in 
chloroform or in toluene. Considering the effect of chemical affinity, the MEH-PPV 
chain was believed to assume a more extended chain conformation in an aromatic 
solvent, such as toluene, due to its affinity to the chain backbone.4,5 By contrast, the 
chain was expected to be more coil-like in an aliphatic solvent, such as chloroform, 
which prevents the exposure of chain backbone to the solvent. Clearly, these 
conjectures contrast somewhat with the CG simulation results, which suggest that the 
overall solvent quality is more relevant for determining the chain conformation, as we 
discuss momentarily. This observation is also in better accord with our later 
observations on supramolecular aggregation properties, which were relatively well 
characterized by a variety of recent experimental studies.    
 For a polymer chain with chemical amphiphicility like the MEH-PPV chain, the 
apparent solvent quality is a curious quantity to explore.  Namely, selective affinities 
of a particular type of solvent to different parts of the MEH-PPV chain make the 
resultant solvent quality somewhat unpredictable. In a MD or CG simulation, one can, 
in principle, retrieve information about the solvent quality by examining the scaling 
behavior of the mean coil size with respect to the degree of polymerization. In 
practice, this procedure could pose a serious challenge to most MD and even CG 
simulations, had the simulation of solvent particles not properly tackled.  With the 
 24
curves of MEH-PPV solutions were more red-shifted when using an aromatic 
solvent.4 In addition, recent SANS observations also suggested that MEH-PPV bears 
a higher degree of aggregation in toluene than in chloroform.10 Both phenomena 
suggest that the aggregation properties in MEH-PPV solutions are closely related to 
the solvent qualities just explored in this simulation. Later, this issue will be further 
addressed on the basis of the simulation results.    
Another fundamental chain property that is usually of interest is the persistence or 
Kuhn length, which yields information about the stiffness of a polymer chain. The 
persistence length, denoted as PL , of a homopolymer may be estimated using the 
following relation:36

⋅= ∑ Q Q ,               (5) 
where Q  and a  are the bond vector and bond length, respectively, and the indices 
,  j k  sum over all segments of the same chain. Thus, the persistence length of 
MEH-PPV is estimated to be 35.3 8.5 (A)±  in toluene and 35.4 6.6 (A)±   in 
chloroform. These results may be compared with an early light scattering analysis, ca. 
60 Å in p-xylene,37 and recent SANS estimations, ca. 34.7 Å in toluene9 and ca. 87.5 
Å in chloroform.10 Although a relatively large simulation noise prohibits a definitive 
conclusion as to the relative chain stiffness in different solvent systems, it appears that 
 26
time shift has been determined by fitting the CG simulation data with the atomistic 
simulation data on the autocorrelation function of the end-to-end vector of a 
MEH-PPV oligomer (i.e., with 6 monomer units).     
Comparing the results of chain diffusivity with those obtained earlier for the 
monomer diffusivity, i.e., 9 2MT 2.83 10  (m /s)D
−= ×  and 9 2MC 7.47 10  (m / s)D −= × , 
one sees that the disparity in the monomer mobility smears off in the corresponding 
full-chain diffusivity. The significance of this phenomenon is twofold. Firstly, it 
indicates how the dynamic behavior of a small molecule or oligomer would, in 
general, be governed by the chemical affinity or intermolecular forces with the 
solvent molecules. With increasing chain length, however, the whole chain behaves 
like a macromolecule, whose dynamic properties are primarily dictated by the 
mean-field drag or the solvent viscosity. Given that the viscosities are nearly the same 
for the two solvents considered, it might be expected that the center-of-mass chain 
diffusivities should stay similar, as observed here. On the other hand, the remaining 
disparity, which clearly falls beyond the prediction of the Einstein-Stokes law as the 
predicted coil size and the known solvent viscosity were employed, is suggestive of 
an effect of solvent quality on single-chain dynamic properties.40 Note, however, that 
a known solvent quality was typically mimicked in a CG simulation by independently 
adjusting the parameters for intermolecular forces.17,18,41

characterize the compactness of an aggregate cluster, we utilize the following 
definition of monomer density:

ρ

 (6) 
where bN  and gR  are the number of monomers and radius of gyration of the 
cluster, respectively. This definition yields 3N 1.0 (bead/nm )ρ = in chloroform and 
3
N 3.4 (bead/nm )ρ = in toluene; the disparity in the compactness of the aggregation 
structure is readily evident. Figure 9 demonstrates how initially separated chains later 
collapse into a single aggregate cluster. The resultant aggregation structures, 
g 63.1 AR =   and 3N 0.9 (bead/nm )ρ =  in chloroform and g 39.3 AR =   and 
3
N 3.9 (bead/nm )ρ =  in toluene bear a similar contrast as noted earlier in Figure 8. In 
particular, the computed monomer densities in both cases are in close agreement, 
suggesting the observed solvent quality dependences of the aggregation feature could 
be universal for the MEH-PPV solutions investigated. Below, we remark on some 
interesting implications that seem to be obtained from the simulation results already 
presented.   
Solvent quality has, in general, been defined according to known single-chain 
properties, such as what we discussed earlier. This fundamental solution property can 
yield information of the relative coil sizes in specific solvents or at given system 
 30
possible to compute the scattering structural factors using proper ensemble averages 
of the single-chain and supramolecular aggregation realizations obtained from a 
similar CG simulation. Thirdly, the proposed model and simulation may serve as a 
basis for construction of even more coarse-grained simulations, so that larger-scale 
aggregation properties might be investigated. Finally, the model construction and 
simulation protocol proposed in this work should be applicable for a wider variety of 
polymer solution systems. In summary, through a self-consistent hierarchy of 
coarse-graining procedures, such as what have so far been demonstrated in this work 
as well as in an earlier Brownian dynamics simulation14 for the case of MEH-PPV 
solutions, it is possible to gain comprehensive molecular insights of a polymer 
solution system that are essential to interpret results from a wide variety of 
experimental characterizations. This is, in fact, among the important goals of 
performing multiscale simulations for systems with complex supramolecular 
structures and physical interactions.

qualities, confirming a generally poor solvent quality for MEH-PPV solutions. The 
coil size was found to be dominated by the apparent solvent quality. Namely, an 
aliphatic solvent—chloroform, which is relatively more attractive to the side-chain 
(but not to the backbone) units of MEH-PPV, resulted in a larger coil size in solution. 
Moreover, the persistence lengths were computed for both solvent systems, and the 
values obtained, p 35 (A)L ≈  , were in fair agreement with those retrieved from recent 
neutron/light scattering data. On the other hand, preliminary observations on 
supramolecular aggregation properties suggested that the aggregation structure is, in 
general, considerably more compact in toluene—a relatively poorer solvent. This 
trend was in agreement with the general observations in recent experiments, and it 
suggested that the solvent quality retrieved from single-chain data may as well be 
utilized to infer the associated aggregation properties.     
 34
the main results shown in this work should be little affected by the naïve 
assumption of independence. To be consistent with this assumption, the 
distribution given in Figure 3b now represents the average distribution of all 
bending angles. In this figure, a good agreement found between the MD and CG 
data also seems to justify the present treatment.

Synopsis: The effect of topological constraint on nonlinear relaxation of a Rouse 
chain in single-step strain flows is scrutinized within two-dimensional lattice 
Brownian dynamics simulations, in which the lattice grids serve as uncrossable 
obstacles which deform affinely with an externally imposed strain. Focus is to 
identify the nonlinear ‘Rouse’ relaxation subject to the topological constraint of grid 
obstacles, and to compare the simulation results (for chain lengths up to 50  
entanglements per chain) with the predictions of two alternative descriptions of the 
Rouse chain: One has been proposed for dilute solution, and the other represents a 
reformulation in the Doi-Edwards (DE) tube theory for entangled system. The 
simulation clearly reveals that, at times greater than the Rouse time of one 
entanglement length, nonlinear chain relaxation is considerably retarded by the 
presence of grid obstacles, independent of the spatial obstacle arrangement or of a 
self-consistent obstacle removal due to convective constraint release. In general, the 
DE theory is able to capture the qualitative trends noted in this simulation, yet it 
considerably underpredicts the observed degree of chain retraction.

INTRODUCTION 
The rheology of entangled polymers are well described by the classic reptation theory 
[de Gennes (1971); Doi and Edwards (1986)], along with several subsequent 
refinements that further accounted for the effects of chain stretch [Marrucci and 
Grizzuti (1988); Pearson et al. (1991)], chain-length fluctuations [Doi (1983); Doi and 
Edwards (1986); Milner and McLeish (1998)], diffusive [Graessley (1982); Watanabe 
(1999)] or convective [Marrucci (1996); Ianniruberto and Marrucci (1996); Mead et 
al. (1998); Milner et al. (2001)] constraint release, non-affine deformation [Marrucci 
et al. (2000)], and interchain (or ‘tube’) pressure [Mhetar and Archer (1999); 
Marrucci and Ianniruberto (2004)]. The success of the Doi-Edwards (DE) tube theory 
in describing the linear viscoelastic properties, and some nonlinear ones, has been 
deemed as important evidence of the effect of topological constraint on chain 
relaxation in an entangled system. The impact of topological constraint on nonlinear 
chain relaxation has not been as well perceived, however. Knowledge in this aspect is 
crucial to discriminate more complicated effects of polymer entanglement in 
nonlinear flows, such as force balances [Marrucci and Ianniruberto (2000); 
Masubuchi et al. (2005); Wang et al. (2007)], interchain pressure [Marrucci and 
Ianniruberto (2004)], and chain disentanglement [Archer (1999b); Wang et al. 
(2007)].    
 Firstly, it came to our notice that a long-standing issue concerning nonlinear 
chain relaxation in an entangled system awaits further clarification. According to the 
classic reptation theory, the primitive chain dynamics in an entangled system can be 
described by a one-dimensional (1D) diffusion of a Rouse chain, as the chain seems to 
be constrained to move along a tube-like region [de Gennes (1971)] In a nonlinear 
relaxation experiment, the later developed Doi-Edwards (DE) tube theory further 
asserted that, while the long-time chain dynamics is substantially modified by the 
 54
appeared that the predictions based on the DE formulation can better capture the 
nonlinear stress relaxation data on a wide series of type-A entangled solutions that we 
have examined [Wen and Hua (2006)]. By contrast, the original Rouse model seemed 
to always lead to a significant overprediction for nonlinear stress relaxation. The 
central implications appear to be the following: Firstly, the inconsistency of the two 
alternative descriptions of a Rouse chain suggested that the concept of ‘Rouse’ 
relaxation in a nonlinear flow experiment is, in fact, ambiguous and must be clarified. 
Secondly, although it appeared that the 1D Rouse chain formulated in the DE tube 
theory is more appropriate for describing the phenomenological chain retraction 
behavior for the entangled solutions examined, it is unclear whether its success might 
be deemed as direct evidence of the effect of topological constraint in a nonlinear flow. 
In fact, it is not entirely clear where the physics of polymer entanglement exactly 
came into play in the DE reformulation, except for a modified boundary condition on 
the chain ends [Doi and Edwards (1986); see also discussion in Wen and Hua (2007)]. 
Finally, it seems that a credible, independent evaluation of the effect of topological 
constraint on the nonlinear relaxation of a usual Rouse chain is an essential step to 
resolve the controversial issues noted above. This can, in principle, be achieved by 
direct experimental studies or coarse-grained simulations.     
 Using Monte Carlo simulations of 2D lattice models, the effects of topological 
constraint on the linear chain dynamics have been extensively investigated in past 
studies [Slater and Wu (1995); Nixon and Slater (1999); Hickey and Slater (2007)]. 
To introduce a flow field, Ianniruberto et al. (1998) have performed 2D lattice 
Brownian dynamics simulation of entangled Rouse chains. An important novel feature 
of this simulation was that the lattice grids served as uncrossable obstacles, which 
deform affinely with the external flow field. Important advantages of this lattice 
model include that it shares the capability of off-lattice schemes, such as molecular 
 56
THEORY 
For an entangled polymer system, a 2D projection yields the physical picture of a test 
chain being surrounded by a certain number of entanglement nodes. Such a picture, 
typically given in the literature or textbook introducing entangled polymers, motivates 
the use of 2D lattice models for studying entangled systems. As mentioned earlier, an 
important special feature of the lattice model considered is that the lattice grids serve 
as uncrossable point obstacles, which deform affinely with an externally imposed 
strain. In addition, the polymer chain is modeled as a comparatively more 
coarse-grained chain, i.e., a Rouse chain, in contrast with a Kuhn chain that has 
typically been employed in lattice simulations. These features, altogether, amount to a 
new model for entangled systems, possessing the major advantages as noted in the 
preceding section. Moreover, identifying the average number of entanglement per 
chains in the present simulation model is relatively straightforward, as contrasted with 
usual lattice [Shanbhad and Larson (2006)] or off-lattice [Everaers et al. (2004)] 
models. On the other hand, it is very important not to confuse the dimensionality 
referred to here (which involves some mathematical projection of the original model 
system) with the one describing a real physical system (which generally implies 
certain geometrical constraints imposed on one or two directions). Indeed, the 
simulation results discussed later suggest that the apparent dimensionality associated 
with the present model should not pose a major problem for its credibility. A recent 
2D formulation of the tube model [Marrucci and Ianniruberto (2005)] also proved 
successful in describing the nonlinear rheological responses of entangled polymer 
liquids. Next, we introduce the essential model parameters in this simulation.   
Firstly, specification of the grid size with respect to the mean length of a Rouse 
segment should, in principle, depend on the level of coarse-graining to be achieved in 
this simulation. Currently, the grid size is set to be equal to the mean end-to-end 
 58
time is conveniently given by 2R H
2 Nτ λπ= , which approaches the usual definition at 
large N  [Doi and Edwards (1986)]. With known material properties, the Rouse time 
constant can be directly estimated in a real experiment [see, for example, Wen and 
Hua (2006) and the references cited therein]. As an entangled system is concerned, 
another fundamental parameter defining the entanglement density must also be 
specified. A convenient choice is to specify the average number of entanglements per 
chain at equilibrium, eqZ —an essential property that can be determined with 
experimentally measured plateau modulus along with a known solvent quality [Ferry 
(1980)]. Given the typical relation between the Rouse time and the reptation time, 
d R eq/ 3Zτ τ =  [Doi and Edwards (1986)], specification of the principal parameters for 
an entangled Rouse chain is now complete. Recall that an early assignment of the grid 
size yields eq1 3N Z− =  in this simulation.     
To this end, Brownian dynamics simulation of an entangled Rouse chain in a 2D 
lattice can be performed in a standard way [see, for example, ttingerO  (1996)], 
except that the chain movement is subjected to the topological constraint imposed by 
grid obstacles, enforced by an algorithm as described in the Appendix. Equilibration 
of initial chain conformation is achieved by performing Brownian dynamics for a time 
comparable with the estimated reptation time. For the case of nonlinear chain 
relaxation, an addition procedure is adopted to mimic the initial chain deformation, as 
we discuss later. For the case of linear dynamics, simulation results are reported for 
the range of chain lengths 15 1 60N< − <  or, equivalently, eq3 20Z< < . For the 
case of nonlinear relaxation, chain lengths up to eq 50Z =  have been attempted. All 
calculations were performed in a single-CPU personal computer, and the longest 
computational times required for the linear and the nonlinear relaxation experiments

D , where cr  is the position vector of the mass center of the 
probed chain. Figure 3 plots the chain-length dependence of the fitted terminal 
relaxation time. A scaling exponent close to 3 is obtained, typical of an entangled 
chain. Note, however, that as the effect of chain-length fluctuations is well captured, 
an exponent close to 3.4 might be produced. The remaining disparity might be 
ascribed to a 2D simulation that misses the contributions of certain fluctuation modes, 
and/or the use of a periodic array of obstacles [Baumgartner and Muthukumar (1997); 
Hickey and Slater (2007)]. Figure 4 shows the chain-length dependence of 
self-diffusivity. Again, the scaling exponent 2.10 0.10− ±  obtained is in good 
agreement with what expected for an entangled system. Overall, we have so far 
confirmed the capability of the simple lattice model considered for capturing essential 
chain dynamics typically observed for an entangled linear-chain system. On this 
ground, next we proceed with the simulation for nonlinear chain relaxation following 
a large step-strain deformation.  
 
Nonlinear relaxation of the Rouse chain: 
As introduced in the preceding section, there exist two alterative descriptions of the 
Rouse chain, presumably for describing systems with different underlying physics of 
chain interactions. Thus, we first summarize the respective formulas arrived at in a 
previous study using normal-mode formulations [Doi and Edwards (1986)], subject to 
the same assumption of affine deformation of the chain (or tube). In terms of the mean 
segmental length ( )l t< > , following a large-step shear strain, they were given by 
[Wen and Hua (2006)]

agreement is essential, suggesting again that the apparent dimensionalities associated 
with the models considered should not matter. Later, as the uncrossability requirement 
is turned on in the lattice simulation, one is expected to directly see the impact of 
topological constraint. As has also been noted earlier, the predictions of Eqs. (1) and 
(2) differs substantially for usual strain magnitudes. Besides, Eq. (2) predicts a 
strain-dependent chain relaxation. This is, in fact, another interesting feature that 
might be compared with the lattice simulation.   
Figure 5 depicts how the grid obstacles and the chain are deformed after a 
single-step shear strain. It appears to us that the initial chain conformation after a step 
strain might be better mimicked in the following way: Firstly, the chain is assumed to 
deform affinely with the bulk flow field. Then, the beads corresponding to the 
end-to-end vectors of every three consecutive Rouse segments (which correspond to a 
‘tube segment’) are anchored, while the whole chain is allowed to freely equilibrate 
for a few Rouse times. The above procedure ensures that not all the chain segments 
deform exactly with the bulk flow, as must be contrasted with the case in dilute 
solution. Moreover, applying the usual relation for chain displacement in a 2D lattice, 
i.e., ( 0 ) ( 0 ) ( 0 )x t x t y tγ+ − −= = = + = , will inevitably result in a larger chain stretch 
at a given strain γ  when compared with the usual 3D case. Thus, subsequent 
comparisons are made on the basis of the same amount of initial mean segmental 
stretch.        
Another noteworthy feature in Fig. 5 is that, as the grid obstacles convect 
directly with an imposed shear strain, the entanglement distance (currently 
represented by the grid size) remains unchanged at all times. This situation must be 
contrasted with the tube model picture, where the entanglement distance or, 
equivalently, the tube segment typically enlarges after the imposition of a large shear 
 64
of Eq. (1) for nonentangled system at all times. And deviations from the Rouse 
behavior for nonentangled system, Eq. (1), become pronounced only at long times 
AND large strains, as partly displayed by Fig. 6 to Fig. 9. Again, this observation is in 
accord with the expectation that a less stretched chain is also less subject to the 
influence of topological constraints.  
At this moment, it is important to note that the central observations in Figs. 6 to 
9 are consistent with an early implication that nonlinear chain relaxation at times 
shorter than the Rouse time was, in general, substantially retarded by polymer 
entanglement [Wen and Hua (2006)]. On the other hand, this observation amounts to 
proving the basic success of the DE theory, Eq. (2), in accounting for an important 
impact of topological constraint, despite the fact that quantitatively the success of the 
theory remains to be further evaluated against off-lattice simulations. For the case that 
the current lattice simulation is to be proven for its quantitative accuracy, a possible 
source of the observed discrepancies (i.e., a somewhat overestimation in the chain 
retardation) is that the ‘tube’ approximation in the DE theory is valid only for 
infinitely long chains, as was typically the case with regard to its linear viscoelastic 
predictions.        
At this point, it is curious to ask what might be the essential physics underlying a 
generally substantial retardation in nonlinear chain relaxation for an entangled system, 
as so far exhibited by this lattice simulation considering topological constraint. 
Consider the case of a purely entropic chain, such as a Kuhn chain. Attempts to relax 
the chain conformation of a deformed, enlarged coil back to the original, equilibrium 
one will inevitably involve many unsuccessful ‘trials’ in the presence of topological 
constraint. This is especially so, as the chain is highly entangled or stretched, when 
the chain embodies a greater number of grid obstacles within its equivalent coil 
volume. This situation is, in fact, similar to that regulating chain reptation in the linear 
 66
the chain length in a power ca. 2.4 0.1± , in comparison with the usual Rouse behavior, 
2.0. Altogether, there appears to be evidence that even the fundamental of the terminal 
chain-length relaxation could be altered, too, by topological constraint. In practice, 
however, the disparity could be too slim to be confidently identified. Incidentally, 
some earlier researchers have argued the possibility of a systematically delayed 
nonlinear chain retraction beyond the usual Rouse regime [Archer (1999b); Marrucci 
and Ianniruberto (2004)]. Experimental techniques utilizing labeled probe chain or 
off-lattice simulations might help resolve this interesting issue.   
 Finally, from a topological point of view, we briefly examine the consequence of 
CCR, whose effect on the chain stretch behavior remains a controversial issue [Mead 
et al. (1998); Ianniruberto and Marrucci (2001)]. To do this in this simulation, we 
have designed a simple algorithm to consistently remove the grid obstacles around a 
test chain according to the computed mean chain retraction rate. Namely, the 
possibility of CCR may be given by CCR eq

Δ=  under the assumption of a 
binary contact for polymer entanglement [Shanbhag and Larson (2006)]. A similar 
effect of chain reentanglement is omitted, since it is anticipated to become active only 
at times close to the reptation time. Figure 15 illustrates how constraint release is 
executed in this simulation. From the simulation result shown in Fig. 16, it appears 
that CCR has little effect on the predicted chain-length relaxation. One possible 
explanation is that the average entanglement spacing remains little changed during 
occasional constraint releases, and thus the test chain would not feel much different in 
the ‘pressure’ imposed by the grid obstacles. Even so, a more pronounced effect of 
CCR might be encountered in elongational flows, as suggested by some recent data 
[Rasmussen et al. (2005)], when the spatial distribution of grid obstacles is to be 
modified substantially. In this respect, the coupling of CCR to a recently suggested

CONCLUSION 
The effects of topological constraint on fundamental chain dynamics and relaxation 
properties were systematically investigated within 2D lattice Brownian dynamics 
simulations, in which the lattice grids served as uncrossable obstacles and the chain 
was modeled as a Rouse chain. The simulation proved successful in describing 
essential linear dynamics as expected for an entangled system. Subsequently, for 
single-step strain experiment, the simulation clearly revealed a general retardation of 
nonlinear chain-length relaxation at times longer than the Rouse time of one 
entanglement length. This observation was in apparent agreement with an earlier 
study, in which the theory/data comparisons made for a series of entangled solutions 
implied a similar trend in nonlinear stress relaxation experiments. Qualitatively, the 
trends noted in this lattice simulation were well captured by the DE tube theory, yet it 
generally underpredicted the observed degree of chain relaxation. Besides, an unusual 
long-time cross-over in the terminal nonlinear relaxation was spotted for two of the 
longest chains simulated, suggesting a possibility of a delayed chain-length relaxation 
beyond the Rouse time regime for highly entangled systems. Off-lattice simulations, 
when reachable, will help assess the precision of this lattice simulation. Moreover, a 
potential future work is to examine the impact of flow-induced grid distortion, say, 
under a step elongational deformation, so as to shed light on recently suggested 
effects of interchain pressure and convective constraint release in nonlinear flows.

APPENDIX 
We briefly introduce how to ensure the topological integrity between the grid 
obstacles and the polymer segments in this 2D simulation. The method was inspired 
by the work of Kumar and Larson (2001), who utilized an elegant way accounting for 
the segmental repulsions of polymer chains in dilute solution. The idea is further 
extended here to account for the interactions between a polymer segment and a grid 
obstacle. As a bead is moved from ( )i tr  to ( )i t t+ Δr , the trajectory produces two 
triangular regions. If there is a grid obstacle located at entjr  and is in any of these 
regions, the movement is forbidden and the bead i is returned to its original position; 
see Fig. A1 for an illustration. Using geometrical arguments, the aforementioned 
criterion of crossing a grid obstacle can be judged with the aid of the following 
definition of a so-called distance vector, D :  
( )ent ent entii ijx x= + − +D P Q P Q ,           (A1)
