1. Introduction 
In recent years, the traffic volumes of freeway grew year by year. Based on data 
from annual report of Taiwan Area Freeway Bureau (2005), mean yearly volume of 
passed toll stations were more than 573 million vehicles, the year growth rate reaches 
1.89%. Furthermore, heavy traffic clogged the freeways in urban segment particularly. 
In addition, comparison of vacation and ordinary day the volume of traffic were 
increased approximately 30%~50%. For this reason, the objective of ramp metering is 
to reduce delay and maintain capacity flow on a freeway by regulating access of ramp 
traffic the mainline (Lee et al., 2006). Ramp metering, as practiced in many large 
metropolitan areas, consists of allocating freeway capacity on a first-come, 
first-served basis. Vehicles arriving at entrance ramps are delayed there by a fixed 
amount of time or until traffic flow on the freeway has been reduced to a certain level. 
Ramp metering has been installed in Taiwan Freeway No. 1 since August 1 1998. 
Fixed-time metering that is the simplest ramp metering strategy has been used.  
Most previous studies focused on the effectiveness of ramp metering in reducing 
the turbulence in the merge zone, system travel time and making effective use of 
capacity, fuel savings (Kang and Gillen, 1999; Piotrowicz and Robinson, 1995). On 
the other hand, drivers have an elevated crash risk when driving on freeway 
interchanges compared with other sections of freeways (McCartt et al., 2004). 
Firestine et al. (1989) reported that about one-quarter of freeway large truck crashes 
occurred on or near ramps, and numerous studies have documented the characteristics 
and circumstances of freeway ramp crashes involving large trucks (Janson et al., 
1998). McCartt et al. (2004) also reported that freeway entrance and exit ramp 
interchanges are the sites of far more crashes per mile than other segments of 
interstate highways. In fact, Banks (2000) reported the main reason for the tendency 
of overlooking the safety improvement associated with ramp metering is that too little 
is known about the crash reduction mechanism. Therefore, an observational study to 
determine the relationship between vehicle speed and road conditions should be 
conducted, and the road-specific speed distributions examined.  
Accident modeling and empirical research has demonstrated a strong relationship 
between speed and frequency and severity of accidents (Finch et al., 1994; Comte and 
Jamson, 2000). Due to the high number of vehicle accidents caused by inappropriate 
speed, law enforcement is obviously a major priority for all agencies involved in road 
safety (Horberry et al., 2004; Hirst et al., 2005). Speeding is recognized around the 
world as a major highway safety problem. Speeding increasing stooping distance and 
there is less time to react to emergency situations, thus increasing the likelihood of 
serious injury or death in crashes that occur (Crombie, 2002; Williams et al., 2006). 
However, speed limits are known to be widely flouted, and there is a common 
intersection; traffic-light status; and driving speed from laser speed gun. In addition, 
one camera with telephoto lens (120x Carl Zeiss) focused on windshield of vehicle to 
catch drivers’ characteristics (i.e. age, gender) and vehicle type. All video signals were 
recorded simultaneously using a multiplex processor on a notebook computer for 
further analysis.  
 
2.3  Procedure 
 Observations were made at ramp metering of freeway with a speed limit of 40 
km/hr (Fig 1). For each location, observations were conducted in non-rush hours 
(11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.) on weekdays. After observations, all traffic conditions were 
video recorded so that driving maneuvers could be subsequently analyzed. Two 
trained observers independently reviewed the video on frame-by-frame. They 
recorded the approaching speed and estimated vehicle type and drivers’ characteristics 
(i.e. age, gender) in comparison to template (e.g. a man with 55 years old). Thus, if a 
drivers’ age seems older than the template, he or she could be defined the older driver 
in present study. Data were only recorded when both observers agreed about the age 
bracket of the driver. Data were only recorded when both observers agreed about the 
age bracket of the driver. For example, Fig 3 presented that the younger male without 
passenger drove by van and vehicle speed reached on 60 km/h during amber light. 
2.4 Data analysis 
 The model of multiple regression with stepwise selection method was utilized to 
examine for factors affecting approaching speed. All variables are categorical and 
presented in Table 1. Hence, the estimated coefficients indicate the estimated speed 
differential between an observation with the particular characteristics and the 
benchmark group. In addition, Logistic regression belongs to the group of regression 
methods for describing the relationship between explanatory variables and a discrete 
response variable. A binary logistic regression is proper to use when the dependent is 
a dichotomy (an event happened or not) and can be applied to test association between 
a dependent variable and the related potential factors, to rank the relative importance 
of independents, and to assess interaction effects (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 1989; 
Norusis, 2004; Yan et al., 2004). Binary logistic regression is used in this study since 
the dependent variable Y (speed limit violation) can only take on two values: Y = 1 
for speed violator, and Y = 0 for speed complier. Further, logistic regression 
coefficients can be used to estimate odds ratios for each of the independent variables 
in the model. Especially for categorical independent variables, the odds ratios 
represent the accident risk comparison among different levels of 
drivers/vehicles/environments.  
 
3. Results 
3.1. Driving speed 
The mean approaching speed with driver characteristics, vehicle type and traffic 
conditions were presented in Table 2. In addition, the model of multiple regression 
with stepwise selection method was utilized to examine for factors affecting 
approaching speed. All variables must pass the tolerance criterion to be entered in the 
equation. Criteria of stepwise selection method involved entered in variables 
(probability of F value <= 0.05) and removed variables (probability of F value >= 
0.10). The regressors from mode l to model 8 are shown in Table 3. The regressor for 
green light was entered in the model 1 (R2 = 0.125), followed by younger drivers in 
model 2 (R2 = 0.0.178), amber light in model 3 (R2 = 0.215), passenger in model 4 
(R2 = 0.235), gender in model 5 (R2 = 0.248), middle-age drivers in model 6 (R2 = 
0.256), vans in model 7 (R2 = 0.285), and sedans in model 8 (R2 = 0.285). Examining 
the regressors in model 8 individually, a number of statements can be made. The 
coefficients of the variables are all positive, but coefficient of the passenger is 
excepted. Moreover, analysis of structure reveals that the major contributing factors 
are traffic light, passengers, drivers’ age and gender and vehicle types. In particularly, 
the factor of traffic light is the highest contributor in speed. The partial effects of 
green light and amber light on the average speed are about 12 km/hr and 8.5 km/hr 
respectively. In addition, the partial effects of vehicle type on the average speed are 
about 8.79 km/hr for vans and 8 km/hr for sedans, respectively. In addition, partial 
effects on speed on male drivers relative to female drivers are over 4.8 km/hr. Also, 
partial effects on speed on younger drivers relative to other drivers are over 10.8 
km/hr. 
 
3.2 Interaction effect  
After confirming the main effect model, the next regression analysis is to explore 
the significant interactions between these factors. There are two interaction factors 
associated with traffic light including: driver age and vehicles on approach speed. The 
distribution of relative speed (reference to posted speed limits) on ramp among traffic 
light shows in Figure 4. The vertical based line (0 km/hr) indicated the posted speed 
limits (40 km/hr). About 11.1% of sedans and 11.8% of vans drove fast than 50 km/hr 
(10 km/hr relative to speed limit). By contrast, no trucks were drove fast than 50 
km/hr at entrance ramp. Fig 5 shows that interaction effects of traffic light and vehicle 
types on mean approach speed. When trucks faced with red light and green light, 
driving speed is lower than other vehicles relatively. Present result is consistent with 
the expectation. However, while traffic light changed to amber, vehicle speed for each 
older drivers maybe not have enough responding tine to face with the changing signal 
phasing from amber to read light (only 3 seconds).

3.2 Speed limit 
A vehicle doing more than 40 km/hr on entrance ramp may be seen to be speeding. 
Further, the binary logistic regression is utilized to examine the risk of speeding 
violation as a function of the variables. The Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic indicates a 
poor fit if the significance value is less than 0.05. Hence, the model adequately fits the 
data (χ2(8) =11.81, p = 0.16). The Cox and Snell R2 and Nagelkerke R2 are 0.264 and 
0.364, respectively. In addition, forward stepwise (likelihood ratio) selection process 
of logistic regression was followed (SPSS 13.0). Logistic model was developed by 5 
steps. Variables of vehicle types×traffic light on step 1, followed by age×passenger on 
step 2, vehicle types×gender on step 3, gender×traffic light on step 4 and age×vehicle 
types on step 5.  
 Table 4 lists the model estimation and odds ratios properly adjusting other factors 
for significant independent variables in final step. The results showed that there are 
some interaction factors associated with risk of speeding including: driver age and 
gender (p < 0.001), gender and passenger (p = 0.01), and vehicle type and traffic light 
(p < 0.001).The odds ratio of 2.747 indicates that the risk of speeding in the sedans 
during green light is nearly three-fold. In particularly, there are larger speeding 
propensity (OR = 5.56) while the sedans during amber light. The results also show 
that the young drivers with no passenger were higher speeding propensity (OR = 
4.16). In addition, there was the largest speeding propensity (OR = 24.36), when vans 
was driven by male. For interaction of gender and traffic light, male drivers were 
higher speeding behavior as expected (OR = 8.15) during green light. Both sedans and 
requires a major and constant police presence. Instead, speed cameras have been used 
extensively to control speeds in ramp. 
 Apart from traffic light, vehicle types were an important contributor associated 
with driving speed. Heavier trucks that are including mixed concrete truck, container 
truck, dump vehicle etc. need to concern with their slower speed. While heavier 
vehicles will occupy the front lane, the rear vehicles want to adopt passing the vehicle. 
It will increase the difficult for driving speed control when drivers faced the signal 
phasing changing from green, amber to red light. In a study of Horberry et al. (2004) 
focused on the potential of driving too slowly in Western Australia and indicated that 
heavily laden vehicles drove more slowly than types of vehicles. An earlier study by 
Hauer (1971) concluded that driving at the median speed was likely to be the safety 
way of traveling. Similarly, Tignor and Warren (1990) found that accident 
involvement rates in urban areas were highest for the slowest 5% and fastest 5% of 
traffic and lowest for traffic in the 30-95% bracket. In present observation, trucks not 
only drove slower, but also they occupied middle lane and congested the traffic flow. 
 
5. Conclusion  
 Speed is a major concern in safety research. Moreover, improved vehicle 
performance and better road standards promote even higher speeds. In summary, there 
were fewer speed violators at the urban intersection where there is greater coercion in 
the form of intensive police surveillance and deployment of speed cameras. On the 
other hand, suburban roads appear to promote speeding because of their improved 
design, higher speed limits and reduced surveillance levels. Thus, enforcement 
strategies involving utilization of stationary police vehicles and speed checkpoints 
should be instituted on suburban roads. Apart from road design, presence of traffic 
lights and vehicle type, driver speed is a reflection of an individual’s attitude. 
Changes in speed choice can be achieved by influencing drivers’ notions about the 
outcomes of speeding or, alternatively, complying with the limit, and by influencing 
their evaluation of the related outcomes.

improved the performance of the diaper (Figure 1a). However, the sizes of disposable diaper are divided into stages and sold 
under three distinct groupings in Seaddlers, Cruisers and Baby Dry (e.g. Pampers Diapers). The diaper in sizes system are 
only classified according to growing stage and infant’s weight (Table 1). If an infant is six months with weight of seven kg, 
how should pick the diaper size to coordinate with her or him (Size 1: Small or Size 2: Medium ?). Obviously, selection of 
diaper size is a problem for parents. On the other hand, the diaper dermatitis or diaper rash is probably the most common 
cutaneous disorders of infancy and early childhood (Figure 1b). Presence of ammonia caused by bacterial breakdown of urea 
in the child’s urine was believed to be a major factor in the etiology of diaper dermatitis (Jackson, 1995). Although friction of 
skin-to-skin and skin-to-diaper is not a dominant factor, it may be an important predisposing factor (Wolf et al., 2000). Thus, 
customers show much concern about picking the diaper for ensuring a perfect fit with their infants. 
Anthropometric data, especially in applications where individuals are measured to determine their size of clothing and 
equipment (Meunier and Yin, 2000). Thus, the primary purpose of this study was to construct an anthropometic database 
about infants for disposable diaper design, and analyze it along with demographic data. The secondary aim of this research 
was to compare the dimensions of disposable diaper in the marketplace with this anthropometic database and suggest the 
optimal dimensions.

4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
Present study recorded the dimensions involved stature, weight, including head circumferences, waist circumferences, 
buttocks circumferences and thigh circumferences from three hundred subjects who aged from newborn to 3 years old were 
separated into eight stratifications (i.e. under one month, 1-3 months, 3-5 months, 2-7 months, 7-9 months, 9-12 months, 1-2 
years, and 2-3 years old). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to investigate the effects of age on dimensions of 
babies. As expected, the results showed that all dimensions were significant age effect. After Duncan’s multiple range tests, 
these dimensions could be stratified six subgroups. However, diapers in the marketplace only have few sizes and classified 
according age and weight. From questionnaires survey (Lien et al., 2004) revealed that picking the well-suited diaper is more 
difficult for infants’ parents, because the diaper sizes system only labeled the infants’ age and weight. However, critical 
dimensions of the diaper (pants) should be circumferences of waist and buttocks. These are just one-third subjects satisfied 
with diaper design (Lien et al., 2004). For worse case, even if infants’ age and stature in one size, we can’t be sure diaper 
well-suitable for their circumferences of waist, buttocks and thigh. In addition, infants wore the wrong size of diaper, and it is 
a marked increase in risk of rash. Thus, present study could provide the anthropometic database for infants to redesign the new 
diaper size. Secondly, apart from infants’ age and stature, circumferences of waist should be addressed and referenced.
