1. Introduction 
 
In recent years the wide use of the electromechanical and electronic devices, such as ultrasonic 
generators, sensors, underwater acoustic, transducers and actuators has promoted the investigations of the 
piezoelectric materials to improve the understanding of the intrinsic coupling effect between mechanical and 
electrical field. In these devices, both electrical and mechanical loads applied on the piezoelectric components 
will give rise to sufficiently high stresses that can lead to their failure. To understand their fracture behaviors, 
many researchers have performed the analyses of piezoelectric materials with defects (e.g., cracks, holes, 
inclusions, etc.). For example, earlier works related to one defect were done by Chung and Ting [2], Lu and 
Williams [15], Gao and Fan [4], Park and Sun [17, 18], Sosa [20], Pak [16], etc., just mention a few. 
Electronic devices are sometimes operated at severe environments such as high temperature and high moisture. 
Under these severe environments the device will deteriorate in a complicated manner such as the observations 
of many undesirable micro-cracks developed. To ensure the integrity of the device, the understanding of 
interactions of the multiple cracks becomes important. Recently investigations on multiple defects have also 
been received much attention. For example, problems with finite collinear cracks have been studied, 
respectively, by Gao and Fan [3] for transversely isotropic piezoelectric materials and by Hao [9] for general 
anisotropic materials. Periodic collinear cracks extended infinitely have been investigated by Gao and Wang 
[5] and later on by Hao [10] with further elaborations on the effects of the permittivity of air contained in the 
cracks. Using different approaches, the interactions of multiple cracks in piezoelectric materials are analyzed, 
respectively, by Han and Wang [8] and Han and Chen [7]. In previous proposal, a sequence of parallel cracks 
embedded in a piezoelectric solid under pressure, in-plane shear, anti-plane shear and electric displacement 
loadings was considered by the present applicant. Following the investigations suggested by Wang and Mai 
[28] and Ueda [26], the boundary conditions on the crack faces are assumed to be electric impermeable in our 
analysis. Based upon the generalized Stroh formalism, a system of singular integral equations with the 
unknown generalized dislocation densities defined on the crack faces are developed to evaluate the 
mechanical and electric coupling effects on the generalized stress intensity factors. The kernel functions of the 
singular integral equations, valid for general anisotropic piezoelectric materials, are expressed in terms of 
infinite sums of certain combinations of polynomial functions. Employing the results developed by Liou and 
 5
embedded in the bodies are also of importance from both academic and practical point of view. 
This is the main purpose of the present report. The procedures of analyzing such problem are 
described in the following section.

2. Formulation 
 
The physical problem to be investigated is shown in Fig. 2. Both materials are assumed to be linear elastic

The ferroelectric ceramics polarized in the 3x  direction possess such behavior. For a hexagonal crystal class 
6 mm which belongs to a transversely isotropic medium, the constitutive equations (1) and (2) are of the form

crack-free perfectly bonded piezoelectric wedge. The poling axis of both piezoelectric materials is assumed 
to be along the 3x -axis. Denoting the wedge angle of material #2 as α , then the angle occupied by material 
#1 will be ( απ −2 ).

 The analysis of this problem may be proceeded by employing the conformal mapping followed by the 
arguments of the analytical continuation. The corresponding complex functions in a crack-free piezoelectric

position and orientation of the crack on the coupling phenomena are also studied in this project Results are not

4. Conclusions 
     A crack embedded in a two perfectly bonded piezoelectric wedge is explored in this report to improve 
the understanding of the intrinsic coupling effects between mechanical and electrical fields. Fundamental 
solution for a generalized screw dislocation interacting with crack-free piezoelectric perfectly bonded wedges 
is developed by employing the conformal mapping followed by the arguments of the analytical continuation. 
Employing the fundamental solution, the system of singular integral equations for the corresponding problem 
is developed which is investigate numerically. The geometric parameters such as the wedge angle, the position 
and orientation of the crack on the coupling phenomena are studied and the important coupling parameters at
