Summary of the activities
We are excited to share the good news that our research work, demonstrated at SIGGRAPH, has
received good press coverage as it is reported in the NewScientist magazine, Engadget, Gearlog,
etc. Many of our research works have been accepted at some of the most selective, prestigious
conferences in computer science this year, including one paper at ACM SENSYS’10, one paper 
at ACM CHI’10, and one paper at ACM UIST’10. Note that the ACM UIST’10 paper is the 
second paper from Taiwan in this conference’s history (the first one from Taiwan was published 
in 1995). The ACM SENSYS’10 paper is also the second paper from Taiwan in this conference’s 
history. These conferences were attended by top academic researchers in the world. We have a lot
of exciting research activities to report this year. Below are some notable projects.
[Digital Health] Vigilant glasses.
“Myopia” is a severe problem among students in Asia and in Taiwan. The prevalence rate of 
myopia in Taiwan is one of the highest in the world. According to statistics, 20.4% of 1st graders
in Taiwan’s elementary school appear to be myopic. This prevalence rate rises up to 61% in 
junior high school, and reaches up 85% in senior high school. Vigilant Glasses are persuasive
technology that aims to slow down the deterioration of myopia for children. This is how the
vigilant glasses work. A child first attaches a wearable sensing device on his/her glasses (or one a
headband). This wearable device wil detect the distance between a child’s eyes and any 
Activity Recognition (Digital health).
Multi-resident activity recognition is among a key enabler in many context-aware and healthcare
applications in a smart home. However, most of prior researches ignore the potential interactions
among residents (such as an elder interacting with his/her families) in order to simplify the
problem complexity. In addition, these prior researches usually recognize multiple-resident
activities by using cameras or wearable sensors which may cause privacy and inconvenience
concerns for elders. Due to human-centric concerns, it is more preferable to avoid using obtrusive
sensors. Therefore, we propose dynamic Bayesian networks which extend coupled hidden
Markov models (CHMMs) by incorporating additional interaction nodes to model both individual
and cooperative activities. In order to improve performance of the models, we categorize sensor
observations according to their data association and the domain knowledge of the sensed
environment. We then validate the performance in the NTU CoreLab, which is populated with
non-obtrusive sensors, and the result shows that our proposed models outperform other baseline
classifiers.
which more computational power would be critical to solve challenging data association
problems and to manage 3D maps of dynamic indoor and outdoor scenes. (See videos:

PipeProbe.
We have designed and developed a mobile sensor node (called PipeProbe) that can determine 3D
spatial topology of hidden water pipelines in buildings and homes. PipeProbe works by dropping
a tiny wireless sensor capsule into the source of the water pipelines. As the PipeProbe capsule
traverses the pipelines, it gathers and transmits sensor readings for reconstructing the 3D spatial
topology of water pipelines. This is a part of green computing initiatives in which PipeProbe
enables an inexpensive way of monitoring the water distribution infrastructure without knocking
down walls or stripping floor coverings. We have created a testbed of horizontal and vertical
pipelines. We evaluated the PipeProbe system using data collected in our experimental testbed.
Results show that the PipeProbe system successfully located and estimated 90% of all pipe tube
lengths within 8-cm accuracy and 90% of all turning points within 15-cm accuracy. This work
will be presented at ACM SENSYS’10. (See video:
