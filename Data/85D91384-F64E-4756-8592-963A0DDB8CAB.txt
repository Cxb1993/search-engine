發式演算法，發表於 ISPA2009 會議中[5]；其次為具
存活力虛擬拓樸之轉換順序問題出了啟發式演算法獲
得刊登於 Photonic Network Communications SCI 期
刊[6]。 
 
1. 導論 
WDM 網路中，考慮具存活性虛擬拓樸在有限轉
換次數限制下如何獲得最佳的新的虛擬拓樸。假設實
體拓樸、現有的虛擬拓樸與新的交通流量為已知，根
據新的交通流量來利用現有的虛擬拓樸來進行重新調
整之動作，在有限重新調整次數(r) 的情況下，期望進
行完重組態動作後能夠降低虛擬拓樸之目標函數值，
該目標函數值為平均權重延遲。由於當重新調整的次
數(r) 較大時，要在多項式時間內找出最佳解是不實際
的。因此提出了兩個啟發式演算法：積極調整啟發式
演算法 (positive reconfiguration heuristic algorithm, 
PRHA) 、 保 守 調 整 啟 發 式 演 算 法 (conservative 
reconfiguration heuristic algorithm, CRHA)。經由實驗，
證實了所提出的啟發式演算法的確可以有效地藉由虛
擬拓樸之調整，進而降低目標函數值而且其改善效果
與最佳解之差異仍在可接受的範圍之內。藉由實驗結
果之分析，可以發現當網路剩餘資源較為有限的情況
下，CRHA 的改善效果會較 PRHA 來的好；反之，則
PRHA 會有著較好的表現。 
在具存活力虛擬拓樸之轉換順序問題中，我們考
慮給定兩個具有存活性的虛擬拓樸，如何找出最佳的
轉移順序使得虛擬拓樸在轉換的過程中 WDM 網路能
持續提供高品質的網路且具有存活力的服務。 
    考慮在靜態交通(static traffic)下，給定分波多工實
體網路與新舊兩個具有存活性的虛擬拓樸，假設對於
每一個虛擬拓樸上的鏈結均對應到一條鏈結不重疊
(link-disjoint)的主要光徑(primary lightpath)與備用光
徑(backup lightpath)，在此情形下，如何設計一個轉換
的順序，使得轉換的過程中，現有的服務不會受到中
斷(no service disruption)且能夠對抗單一光纖失效的最
佳轉換順序的研究(transition sequence)。 
給定上層傳輸交通的需求(traffic demand) 、目前
的虛擬拓樸與新的虛擬拓樸，假設新與舊的虛擬拓樸
均具有存活性，而存活性的機制是採用專屬的保護方
式(dedicated protection)。此問題的主要目標在找到一
個最佳的轉換順序將目前的虛擬拓樸轉換到新的虛擬
拓樸，使得所考慮的目的成本(objective cost)為最小。
而本計畫中所考慮的目的成本為平均加權延遲
(average weighted delay)。此問題為 NP-hard 問題，因
為在不具存活性的虛擬拓樸的轉換問題已被證明是
NP-hard[1]。亦即，對於較大的輸入，希望在多項式時
間找到最佳解是不實際的。故設計啟發式演算法來解
決此問題。  
2. 問題定義與假設 
  WDM 網路環境與保護機制的假設： 
z 分波多工網路上的任意節點間僅存在單一條光
纖，且允許雙向傳輸。 
z 分波多工網路上任一條實體鏈結損毀的機率均
相等，僅考慮單一光纖故障，亦即，同一時間只
有一個光纖會發生故障。 
z 傳送需求從主要光徑切換至備用光徑上的動作
是屬於即時的，在切換過程中並不會造成大量的
封包遺失。 
z 分波多工網路上的節點均不具備波長轉換之功
能。 
z 分波多工網路的實體拓樸是屬於雙連通
(bi-connected)。 
z 虛擬拓樸上任意兩節點均可順利傳送資料，亦即
圖型為連通(connected)。 
z 節點 i 上發送器(
iTX )和接收器( iRX )的個數是
不允許額外擴增的。假設網路上的每個節點均擁
有相同個數的
iTX 、 iRX 且 ii RXTX = 。 
z 假設現有的保護機制為採用專屬保護機制
(dedicated protection)，其中備用光徑與所對應的
主要光徑為鏈結不重疊。備用光徑上所使用的波
長不允許與其它光徑共享。 
2.1 問題定義 
在本計畫中，WDM 網路上具有專屬保護機制的
虛擬拓樸的最佳轉換順序問題被定義與研究。給定一
個實體網路，需求矩陣(demand matrix)，兩個虛擬拓
4 
 
立新光徑有衝突的舊光徑)所需要的時間為一個單位
階段(stage)。假設每一個新的光徑的建立時間均相同
(可以考慮更複雜的情形，建立一個光徑所要移出的舊
光徑數越多，所需時間越長，或所有受影響的光徑的
總長度和等)。因此，將目前的虛擬拓樸轉換成新的虛
擬拓樸共有可以分成 newE 個階段。 
    在考慮具有存活性的虛擬拓樸網路上的轉換順序
的問題時，有兩種不同的考量，分述如下： 
(1) Link-based 合併轉換：每一個主要光徑與備用光
徑要同組做轉換，亦即轉換時以 ),( newbinewpi ll 為一
組。因此，將目前的虛擬拓樸轉換到新的虛擬拓
樸共有|Enew|個階段。如此的轉換方式較為簡易，
便於記憶，可以確保在完成每一階段的轉換後，
現有的網路狀態對於每一個主要光徑均有備用光
徑。而且可以提供與保證虛擬拓樸具有存活性。 
(2) Path-based 分離轉換：主要光徑與備用光徑可以
不同組做轉換，亦即轉換時主要光徑與備用光徑
分 開 考 慮 ， 以 }|| ..., ,2 ,1 ,{ newnewpi Eil = 與
}||..., ,2 ,1 ,{ newnewbi Eil = 光徑，則將目前的虛擬拓
樸轉換到新的虛擬拓樸共有 2×|Enew|個階段。在允
許主要與備用路徑不同組轉換時的方式。但此種
轉換方式無法保證轉換時具有對抗單一光纖故障
失效的保護機制，故不予考慮。 
2.4 目的函數 
    如同前面的定義，當一個網路進行調整時，必須
使得在轉換的過程中，網路的品質影響最小。定義兩
個節點 s, d 間的加權延遲(weighted delay, WD)為
Λ(s,d)× D(s,d)，其中 D(s, d)代表兩點間最短的延遲。
令 X 代表所有(s, d)序對的集合。 
    定義 X 代表所有節點對(s, d)的集合，給定一個轉
換的順序 } ..., , ,{
||21 newElllS = ，其中 newnewi El ∈ 代
表一個主要路徑與備用路徑的組合 ),( newbinewpi ll 。令
newi EiG ,...,2,1, = 代表現有的虛擬拓樸 Gold 在經過
前 i 次轉換後的虛擬拓樸，亦即將 } ..., , ,{ 21 illl 加入
Gold 。當然， oldGG =0 且 newE GG new = 。定義
),( dsD iG 代表節點對(s, d)在虛擬拓樸 G
i時的最小傳
遞延遲(minimal propagation delay)。定義 ),( dsW iG 代

(weighed propagation delay, WPD) ， 由 公 式
),(),(),( dsDdsdsWD ii GG ×Λ= 。然而因為備用路
徑只在網路鏈結故障時才能提供備援服務，在計算兩
個節點之間的傳送距離或是延遲時並不須列入考慮。

定義此問題為分波多工網路上具存活性虛擬拓樸
最佳轉換順序之研究-專屬保護機制。給定傳輸需求矩
陣、目前的俱存活性虛擬拓樸與新的俱存活性虛擬拓
樸，本問題的主要目標在找到一個最佳的轉換順序
(transition sequence)將目前的虛擬拓樸轉換到新的虛
擬拓樸，使得所考慮的目的函數(4)為最小。 
3. 啟發式演算法 
    由於此問題為 NP-hard 的問題，故設計啟發式演
算法來解決此問題。於所設計的啟發式演算法中，首
先，一個事先處理的步驟(preprocessing step)用於將新
的虛擬拓樸中的光徑的波長作一個轉換，希望經過這
個轉換之後，新與舊的虛擬拓樸之間的衝突(conflict)
個數能減少。其次，將新的光徑分成三個集合，並設
計方法從這些集合中選出適當的光徑來做轉換。 
3.1 波長重新指派前處理階段(Wavelength 
Reassigned Preprocessing Phase, WRPP) 
因為新舊虛擬拓樸間的衝突確實會影響虛擬拓樸
轉換的效能，然而，在現有的虛擬拓樸中，光徑與波
長均已確定而不可以變動，只有調整新虛擬拓樸光徑
所使用的波長才有辦法降低可能的衝突。首先，找出
那些具有相同來源節點、目的節點與相同繞送路徑但
分屬於不同的虛擬拓樸的光徑，很明顯的，如者這兩
個路徑視為不同，則於轉換時需要增加新路徑與刪除
一個路徑，導致所需要路徑轉換的階段(stages)數增
加，而整體的效能會降低，故這些光徑並不考慮於轉
換順序之中。對於其他的新的虛擬拓樸中的光徑，若
不重新指派波長，當此光徑加入虛擬拓樸時，可能導
致與其他的現有的光徑衝突，而需要移除較多的光
徑，故透過波長的重新指派可以獲得較佳的轉換效

(2) CBC 中鏈結的選擇：如果 NC 為空集合，則
先從集合 CBC 中選擇適合的鏈結作加入的
動作。至於鏈結的選擇，可以利用以下兩種
方式： 
i. Least WD first (LWDF) ： 假 設

ii. Greatest conflict first (GCF) ： 令

結 new

數。更精確的 conflict( 'G , newil )可以定

結，並刪除以便 new
il 能順利加入。對於
RXi<2 的情形，從 RT( newil )找出一個刪
除後不會導致虛擬拓樸不連通的鏈
結，並刪除以便 new

iii. Least conflict first (LCF)：選擇鏈結
new
il 具有最小的 conflict( 'G , newil )加入
虛擬拓樸中。 
(3) DIC 中鏈結的選擇：如果 NC 與 CBC 均為
空集合，則從集合 DIC 中選擇適合的鏈結作
加入的動作。然而，DIC 中的鏈結加入後會
導致虛擬拓樸不相連，為了達到在轉換過程
中服務不中斷且具有 dedicated-protected 的
要求，要加入 DIC 中的鏈結則須要暫時先加
入一些額外不在Enew且不與現在的虛擬拓樸
衝突的鏈結至虛擬拓樸中，以避免服務中斷
的情形發生。故需要解決一些問題如：(i) DIC
中要選擇哪一個鏈結？(ii) 要加入哪些額外
的鏈結？(iii) 這些額外鏈結的繞送路徑與
波長為何？很明顯得，如果 DIC 中鏈結加入
後將虛擬拓樸分割成較多的連通分量
(connected components)，則必須要加入許多
的額外鏈結。對於 DIC 中的鏈結 new

代表 "G 上的連通分量的個數。故 DIC 中的
鏈結依 NCC 之值由小至大排序。以最小
NCC 值為優先。對於一個選定的鏈結 new
il ，
找出 "G 與 NCC( newil )，則此時可以找出可行
額外的鏈結的集合 EXL( new
il )。更精確的可
以定義為 EXL( new
il )={(s, d)|s, d 位於 "G 中
不同的連通分量且 TXs≧2,RXd≧2}，則依據
NCC( new
il )之值，需要從 EXL( newil )選出
NCC( new
il )-1 個鏈結使得加入 "G 後變成連
通。值得注意的是，所選出的額外鏈結必須
在執行插入鏈結 newil 前加入，同時所選定的
額外所需要的資源(如傳送器、接收器、波長
等)必須要能事先獲的保留。故相對於每一個
額外鏈結的一對鏈結不相交的光徑與所需
波長必須要能在 new
i
X lGG ∪= ' 上找到。而
繞送路徑則以最短路徑法搜尋、波長指派以
First-Fit 法找尋。 
3.4 Link-Based Transition Algorithm 
    綜合以上的說明，可以設計一個啟發式演算法
Link-Based Transition Algorithm (LBTA)，演算法敘述
如下： 
Algorithm: LBTA 
Input: Gold(V, Eold), Gnew (V, Enew), Λ(s, d), ∀ (s, d) ∈ V× V 
Output: Transition sequence S,α(S). 
Step 1: Perform wavelength reassigned algorithm to determine the new 
assigned wavelengths of lightpaths in Gnew. Remove those 
lightpaths with same route and wavelength in Enew ∩ Eold from 
Enew. Let S=∅. 
Step 2: For all links in Gnew, find the N( new
il ), CPR( newil ), CT( newil ), 
and CR( new
il ). Construct sets of links NC, CBC, and DIC. 
Step 3: While ((NC ∪CBC∪ DIC)≠ ∅) perform Steps 3.1-3.3. 
Otherwise output S and STOP. 
Step 3.1: If (NC ==∅) then goto Step 3.2; otherwise select a link 
new
il  in NC with the best selected cost according to 
8 
 
由圖 1 之結果可以發現，LWDF 可以獲得最佳的結
果，LWDF+GCF 其次。而同時 LWDF 也是最快的
演算法。同時也發現，當 TXs/RXs 的個數增加，
整個成本也降低，但所需的執行時間增加。

Abstract Wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM)1
technology has emerged as a promising technology for2
backbone networks. The set of all-optical communication3
channels (lightpaths) in the optical layer defines the virtual4
topology for the upper layer applications. Since the traffic5
demand of upper layer applications fluctuates from time to6
time, it is required to reconfigure the underlying virtual topol-7
ogy in the optical layer accordingly. However, the reconfig-8
uration for the virtual topology is reluctantly disruptive to9
the network since some lightpaths should be torn down and10
some traffic has to be buffered or rerouted during the recon-11
figuration process. Therefore, it needs to have an efficient12
transition method to shift the current virtual topology to the13
new one so as to minimize the effect of the reconfiguration on14
the upper layer traffic. In this article, the WDM virtual topol-15
ogy transition sequence problem (WVTTSP) which mini-16
mizes the average weighted delay (AWD) is studied. Since17
the WVTTSP is NP-hard, a heuristic solution model is pro-18
posed to solve it. Simulation results show that the proposed19
least weighted distance first (LWDF) method can find the20
best result and the time spent by it is less than 4 s for a mid-21
dle-sized network with 100 links and with 30 wavelengths22
per link.23

1 Introduction 27
The growth of Internet traffic increases the demand for data 28
transmission capacity dramatically. Wavelength-division 29
multiplexing (WDM) is a promising technique that is expected 30
to fulfill this capacity need. In a WDM-based network, each 31
routing node is equipped with add-drop devices and with a 32
limited number of transceivers. Each routing node can work 33
as the starting or the ending point of a lightpath at which 34
E/O conversions can be performed. Furthermore, a routing 35
node can also work as an intermediate switching point on 36
a lightpath switching an incoming wavelength to the out- 37
going link using the same wavelength. In WDM, packets 38
are carried on a unique wavelength from a source node to 39
a destination node passing through nodes where the data 40
signals are optically routed and switched without regener- 41
ation in the electrical domain. Lightpath is the basic mech- 42
anism of communication in WDM [1,2]. To avoid collision, 43
no two lightpaths using the same wavelength pass through 44
the same link (named as wavelength-continuity constraint) 45
[3]. 46
1.1 Virtual topology design 47
A virtual topology consists of a set of lightpaths. Indepen- 48
dence between virtual topology and physical topology is an 49
important characteristic of WDM networks. Virtual topology 50
design is an important problem in WDM networks; given 51
the traffic demand and the physical topology, the goal is to 52
design a virtual topology with some resources constraints 53
(e.g., links, wavelengths, transceivers) so that the objective 54
cost can be minimized. 55
The virtual topology for a WDM-based network should 56
be designed based on both the physical network topology 57
and the traffic pattern of upper layers [4–8]. The exact 58

1.5 Studied problem159
In this article, the transition sequence problem on WDM vir-160
tual topology with dedicated protection is defined and stud-161
ied. Given the physical network, demand matrix, two (cur-162
rent and new) virtual topologies, the goal is to find an optimal163
transition sequence (from old to new) such that the objective164
cost can be minimized. The objective cost considered in this165
article is the average weighted delay (AWD) which is more166
accurate than those proposed in [28,38]. This problem is167
denoted as WDM virtual topology transition sequence prob-168
lem (WVTTSP) in which goal is to find the optimal transition169
sequence such that the AWD can be minimized. Because the170
transition problems for WVTCTP is NP-hard [38] which is a171
special case of WVTTSP, this problem is a NP-hard problem.172
Thus, finding an optimal solution for it is impractical due to173
exponential growth in execution time. In this article, a heu-174
ristic solution model is proposed to solve it and simulation175
of the proposed algorithm will be given.176
This article is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, the formu-177
lation of the WVTTSP is described. In Sect. 3, the proposed178
heuristic solution model to find the optimal solution of the179
WVTTSP is described. Experimental results and conclusions180
are given in Sects. 4 and 5.181
2 Problem formulation182
2.1 Notations183
Let G(V,E, f ) represent the physical topology of a WDM184
network, where V = {vi |i = 1, 2, . . . , n} is the set of (OXC)185
nodes, E = {eij = (vi, vj )|vi, vj ∈ V } is the set of fibers,186
eij be the fiber connecting nodes vi and vj , and f (eij ) is187
the propagation delay between nodes vi and vj . The traffic188
demand between the source node s and the destination node189
d of the upper layer is denoted as (s, d). Assume the traf-190
fic demand is fixed and known. Let Gold(V ,Eold , wei) be191
the current (or old) virtual topology, where Eold consists of192
a set of links {loldi |i = 1, 2,…,|Eold |}. In the dedicated–193
protected WDM network, each link in the virtual topology194
is mapped to primary and backup lightpaths and denoted195
as loldi = (l
old
pi , l
old
bi ). Virtual link esd is the link between196
nodes s and d. Assume link is bidirectional, i.e., esd =197
eds . Let paths,d represent the set of physical fibers passed198
by the lightpath esd and wei(esd) is a weighted function199
of link esd that represents the propagation delay between200
nodes s and d computed bywei(esd ) =
∑
exy∈paths,d
f (exy).201
Note that wei(esd) = wei(eds). The new virtual topology is202
denoted by Gnew (V ,Enew, wei), where Enew ={lnewi =203
(lnewpi , l
new
bi )|i = 1,2,…,|E
new|}.204
Assume the same lightpaths (with same route and same205
wavelength) that are used both in the new and old virtual206
topologies will remain unchanged. The old lightpaths that use 207
any resources (including wavelength, transmitter, or receiver) 208
that are in conflict with any new lightpath will be reluc- 209
tantly torn down in order to establish the new lightpath [28, 210
38]. 211
2.2 Assumptions 212
In this article, the physical topology, existing and new vir- 213
tual topologies and new traffic demand are known in advance. 214
Moreover, there are some assumptions shown as follows: 215
– For each edge in the physical network, there is a single 216
fiber connecting the end-nodes in the WDM network, and 217
the data can be transmitted bidirectionally. 218
– For each node in the physical network there is no wave- 219
length converting capability. 220
– We assume the single link failure scenario. 221
– The physical topology is two-connected, i.e., the single 222
fiber failure does not disconnect the physical network. 223
– The existing and final virtual topologies should be con- 224
nected. 225
– The dedicated path-protection scheme is applied, i.e., for 226
each connection (or lightpath), two edge-disjoint primary 227
and backup paths are established. 228
– Once a logical link is used to connect two nodes in the 229
WDM network, this link is bi-directional. That is two 230
lightpaths with different directions are established. More- 231
over, two edge-disjoint paths are established which act as 232
the primary and backup paths. 233
– The numbers of transmitters and receivers at node i ∈ V 234
are denoted by Ti and Ri , respectively. In this article, it 235
is assumed that Ti = Ri, 1 ≤ i ≤ n. It is also assumed 236
that each transmitter/receiver is tunable and can be tuned 237
to any wavelength. 238
– All lightpaths should satisfy the wavelength continuity 239
constraint. 240
Because reconfiguration transition may cause packet delay 241
or loss, it is crucial to notice the effect on the traffic demand 242
to the network during the reconfiguration process. Assume 243
there is no traffic loss and the traffic on the torn-down light- 244
paths will be rerouted to other paths that are determined using 245
a shortest path algorithm. A newly established lightpath will 246
be available for use once established. The transmission delay 247
between a source-destination (s–d) pair is measured by the 248
number of lightpaths from s to d. Assume that lightpath 249
be the minimum unit for reconfiguration which is similar 250
to the assumption studied in [27,28]. To establish a new 251
lightpath having a conflicting relation with any old light- 252
path, a two-phase procedure stated in [28] is illustrated as 253
follows: 254

can be minimized. Moreover, after performing wavelength344
reassignment, it assumes that: (1) The total number of used345
wavelengths of the new virtual topology after reassignment346
should be the same as the number before reassignment; (2)347
The routes of the lightpaths do not change; (3) Those paths348
assigned to the same wavelength-network before reassign-349
ment should be reassigned to the same wavelength-network350
after reassignment.351
Let W = {w1, w2, . . . , w|W |} be the set of wave-352
lengths provided by the WDM network and PS = PSnew1 ,353
PSnew2 , . . . , PS
new
|W | be the set of lightpaths in Enew where354
PSnewi is assigned to the ith wavelength. First, a bipartite355
graph BG(PS,W,EBG) is constructed. For each pair of356
nodes PSnewi ∈ PS, for all i = 1, 2, . . . , |W | and wj ∈ W ,357
for all j = 1, 2, . . . , |W |, there is an edge between them, and358
these edges form the set EBG. The weight of edge (PSi, wj )359
in EBG (connecting PSi ∈ PS to wj ∈ W ) is set to be360
the number of conflicts that occurred if lightpaths in PSi361
are reassigned to wavelength wj . Note that, if the routes of362
two lightpaths are partially overlapping, then the number of363
conflicts is counted as 1.364
Obviously, the wavelength reassigning subproblem can365
be formulated as a minimal weighted matching problem on366
bipartite graphBG(PS,W,EBG), which is known as assign-367
ment problem [39]. Therefore, the Hitchcoch Algorithm [39]368
can be applied to find minimal conflict matching of the assign-369
ment problem in O(|W |3) time.370
3.2 Construction of sets371
In WVTTSP, the old and new virtual topologies are dedi-372
cated-protected. Links (consisting of two lightpaths) inEnew373
are inserted one by one into the current virtual topology.374
This transition method is named as link-based transition, in375
which the order of primary and backup paths of the same376
link are arbitrary, but after the lightpath has been inserted377
the other lightpath should follow immediately. The transition378
sequence can be represented as {(lnewp1 , lnewb1 ), (lnewb2 , lnewp2 ),379
. . . , (lnewp|Enew |, l
new
b|Enew |)} or simply represented as {lnew1 , lnew2 ,380
. . . , lnew|Enew |}.381
For each link lnewi = (l
new
pi , l
new
bi ), assume si and di be the382
source and destination nodes of link lnewi . Let CPR(l
new
i )383
denote the set of lightpaths in Gold which conflict with lnewi384
in the routing paths and assigned wavelengths. CT (lnewi )385
and CR(lnewi ) denote the set of lightpaths in Gold which386
conflict with lnewi in the same transmitter and same receiver,387
respectively. To insert a new link lnewi into the current virtual388
topology, first, the set of lightpaths in CPR(lnewi ) should389
be removed from the current virtual topology. If removing390
CPR(lnewi ) does not disconnect the virtual topology and391
the number of sparse transmitters or receivers of si and di392
are available, then link lnewi can be inserted. If removing393
CPR(lnewi ) does not disconnect the virtual topology but the 394
number of sparse transmitters or receivers of si and di are not 395
available, then one path inCT and/orCR should be removed 396
to release the transmitter or receiver. All links in Enew are 397
classified into three types: 398
– No conflict (NC): link lnewi added into current virtual 399
topology G′ does not cause any conflict. That is, NC = 400
{lnewi |CPR(l
new
i ) = ∅ ∧ TXi ≥ 2 ∧ RXi ≥ 2}, 401
where TXi and RXi are the number of free transmit- 402
ters of si and the number of free receivers of di , respec- 403
tively. 404
– Conflict but connected (CBC): Set CBC consists of link 405
lnewi with CPR(l
new
i ) = ∅ and l
new
i added into current 406
virtual topology G′ does not cause disconnection. 407
– Disconnected (DIC): link lnewi added into current vir- 408
tual topology G′ causes the resulting virtual topology to 409
become disconnected. 410
The algorithm performs as follows: If NC is nonempty, 411
the link in NC is to be selected with higher priority. If NC 412
is empty, then link in CBC is to be selected with higher pri- 413
ority. A link in DIC is selected only in the situation that 414
NC and CBC are empty sets. It is worth noting that the con- 415
tents of the sets should be updated when a link is selected 416
and inserted. After insertion, CPR(lnewj ), CT (l
new
j ), and 417
CR(lnewj ) of link l
new
j (i = j ) should be updated. 418
3.3 Link selection 419
3.3.1 Link selection in NC 420
If NC is nonempty, a link in NC = {lnewi |CPR(l
new
i ) = 421
∅ ∧ TXi ≥ 2∧ RXi ≥ 2} is to be selected with higher pri- 422
ority. A link in NC with the lowest of the objective cost 423
is selected and inserted into the current virtual topology. 424
Because link lnewi consists of two lightpaths l
new
pi and l
new
bi , the 425
insertion order of the two paths may affect the objective cost. 426
If
∑
∀(s,d)∈X[DG′∪lnewpi
(s, d)−DG′∪lnewbi
(s, d)]×(s, d) < 0 427
then path lnewpi is inserted first; otherwise, path l
new
bi is inserted 428
first. Because there may exist many links in NC, the effect 429
of insertion is computed and compared for each of them and 430
the best one is selected. Two heuristics can be used to select 431
a link form NC. 432
– Least WD first (LWDF): Let WD(G′, lnewi ) be the 433
weighted delay of the virtual topology G′ after insert- 434
ing link lnewi , the link l
new
min with minimal value, i.e., WD 435
(G′, lnewmin ) ≤ min∀ lnewi ∈NC WD(G
′, lnewi ) is selected and 436
inserted. 437
– Maximal WD first (MWDF): Select the link lnewi from 438
NC with maximal DG′(s, d)×(s, d). 439

4 Experimental results 555
In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed heu- 556
ristic algorithm, the algorithm was implemented and applied 557
to solve problems that were randomly generated. The results 558
of the experiments are reported below. The implementation 559
was conducted in C++, and all the experiments were run on 560
a personal computer (PC) with a Pentium IV 2.4 GHz CPU 561
and 1024 MB RAM. 562
The physical network of the example is randomly gener- 563
ated. The virtual topology for a given traffic pattern is deter- 564
mined by using the max multihop (MM) algorithm proposed 565
in [7]. The new virtual topology is determined based solely 566
on the given traffic pattern and is independent of the old vir- 567
tual topology. It is assumed that each node in the network has 568
the same number of transceivers and each link has the same 569
number of wavelengths. The traffic demands between each 570
node pair (s, d) for both the new and old logical topologies is 571
randomly generated confirming to uniform distribution over 572
the range of [0–100]. The delay of fiber is also randomly 573
generated confirming to uniform distribution over the range 574
of [0–100]. 575
Four algorithms were used and examined, they are: LWDF, 576
LWDF+GCF, LDWF+LCF, MWDF+LWDF. In these

Abstract—In a Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) net-
work, the performance of the virtual topology designed for a
pre-specified traffic pattern can be improved by performing
virtual topology reconfiguration. Simultaneously, the provision
of survivability of WDM networks is important, because the
transmission of huge data should be protected when a fiber fails.
Thus, the combination of survivability and reconfiguration is an
important issue in WDM networks.
In this paper, the Virtual Topology Reconfiguration Problem
(VTRP) on WDM networks with a reconfiguration constraint is
studied. Given the physical topology, dedicated path-protection
virtual topology and a new traffic demand matrix, the goal
of VTRP is to reconfigure current virtual topology under the
pre-specified reconfiguration constraint (r, a positive integer)
so that the objective value can be minimized. The objective
cost of VTRP is the average weighted propagation delay (AWPD).
Because designing a polynomial time algorithm to find the
optimal solution of VTRP is impractical when the reconfiguration
constraint r is larger, two heuristic algorithms are proposed to
solve this problem. They are Positive Reconfiguration Heuristic
Algorithm (PRHA) and Conservative Reconfiguration Heuristic Al-
gorithm (CRHA). Experimental results of these algorithms are also
given.
Keywords: WDM, survivability, reconfiguration, heuristic
algorithm, dedicated path-protection.
I. INTRODUCTION
There is a growing consensus that the next generation
Internet will employ an IP-over-WDM architecture [1]. In
this architecture, IP routers are attached to the optical cross-
connects (OXCs) and IP links are realized by lightpaths. A
virtual topology (VT) consists of a set of lightpaths in an
optical network. The virtual topology design (VTD) problem
is an important problem in WDM networks. Given the traffic
demand and the physical topology, the goal of the VTD
problem is to design a virtual topology with some resources
constraints (e.g., links, wavelengths, transceivers, etc) so that
the objective cost can be minimized [2], [3].
Independence between virtual topology and physical net-
work is an important characteristic of WDM networks. When
the traffic pattern changes, the virtual topology reconfiguration
(VTR) becomes a significant topic. The main idea of VTR
is to reconfigure the current virtual topology to get a better
VT instead of re-designing a whole new one. In contrast with
the re-designing approach, VTR can find a virtual topology
quickly to meet the goal pattern [4]–[13] within constraints.
In WDM networks, a wavelength channel has a transmission
rate greater than gigabit per second. If the fiber links fail, a
lot of connection streams will be dropped. So survivability
is important in IP-over-WDM networks. Many protection and
restoration schemes have been proposed to achieve surviv-
ability in the optical layer [14]–[17]. Protection strategies
can be further classified as dedicated protection, shared-link
protection, shared-path protection, and shared sub-path pro-
tection. Because dedicated protection has better performance
and efficiency than shared protection, most of the existing
topologies use the dedicated protection design. In dedicated
protection, for each connection, there is a pair of edge-disjoint
(primary and a backup) lightpaths [14], [15]. Survivable WDM
network design problems are mostly formulated as integer
linear programs (ILP) and are identified as NP-hard to solve.
In this paper, the Virtual Topology Reconfiguration Problem
(VTRP) in survivable WDM networks with a reconfiguration
constraint is studied. The formulation and definition of the
VTRP of WDM networks were studied in [18], [19]. Given
the WDM network, an existing dedicated path-protection
virtual topology and a new traffic demand matrix, the goal
is to reconfigure the current virtual topology to generate a
new virtual topology under the pre-specified reconfiguration
constraint (RC, a positive integer) so as to minimize the
objective value. The objective cost considered in this paper
is the average weighted propagation delay (AWPD). Because
designing polynomial time algorithms to find the optimal
solutions of VTRP is impractical when the reconfiguration
constraint RC is large. In this paper, two heuristic algorithms
are proposed to solve the VTRP on survivable WDM networks.
Experimental results of these algorithms are also given.
The organization of this paper is as follows: In Section
2, some background and related works are given. Section 3
gives a formal description of the VTRP problem. Section 4
describes the proposed heuristic algorithms. Simulation results
are presented in Section 5, and some concluding remarks are
given in Section 6.
the WDM network, respectively. Note that P ⊂ E′, B ⊂ E′,
P∩B = ∅, and P∪B = E′. The minimal delay between nodes
vs and vd on virtual topology G′(V, P,wei) and G′(V,B,wei)
are denoted as dPsd and d
B
sd, respectively. Let TXi and RXi
represent the number of transmitters and receivers of node vi,
respectively.
B. Assumptions
In this paper, the physical topology, existing virtual topol-
ogy, new traffic demand, and the reconfiguration constraint
(RC, a positive integer) are known in advance. Moreover, we
assume that:
• For each edge in the physical network, there is a single
fiber connecting the end-nodes in the WDM network, and
the data can be transmitted bidirectional.
• For each node in the physical network there is no wave-
length converting capability. All lightpaths should satisfy
the wavelength continuity constraint [2].
• Only the single fiber failure scenario is considered in this
paper.
• The physical topology is two-connected, i.e., the single
fiber failure does not disconnect the physical network.
• The existing and final virtual topologies are connected.
• The transmitters and receivers are tunable. The number
of transmitters and receivers are fixed and known.
• The reconfiguration constraint is used to constrain the
number of changes on bi-directional lightpaths (including
delete, add, or re-route).
C. Objective
The minimal hop distance between nodes vs and vd on
virtual topology G′(V, P, 1) and G′(V,B, 1) are denoted as
hPsd and h
B
sd, respectively. The average weighted hop-distance
(AWHD) is defined as
Have =
∑
∀vs,vd∈V Tsd × (hPsd + hBsd)∑
∀vs,vd∈V Tsd
. (1)
The value of hPsd is equal to h
B
sd in the dedicated path-
protection virtual topology. The performance and efficiency of
a virtual topology cannot be measured by the AWHD, because
it will not reveal the extra cost when transmitting by the
backup lightpath. Therefore, the average weighted propagation
delay (AWPD) is defined and used to model the performance
of the dedicated path-protection virtual topology. The average
weighted propagation delay is defined as
Dave =
∑
∀vs,vd∈V Tsd × (dPsd + dBsd)∑
∀vs,vd∈V Tsd
. (2)
In this paper, the reconfiguration action is performed on a
link of the virtual topology, lightpaths mapped by the link
of the exiting virtual topology can be deleted, added, and
rerouted. The action performed on one primary or backup
lightpath is counted by one. In this paper, the total number of
reconfiguration actions should be less than or equal to RC. Af-
ter performing reconfiguration, the final virtual topology must
be a connected graph and be survivable with dedicated path-
protection. In this paper, the virtual topology reconfiguration
problem (VTRP) with a reconfiguration constraint is defined
and studied. Given the physical topology, virtual topology,
traffic demand matrix, and the reconfiguration constraint, the
goal is to reconfigure current virtual topology under the
reconfiguration constraint to a new one so that the AWPD
can be minimized.
IV. HEURISTIC ALGORITHMS FOR VTRP
Because designing a polynomial time algorithm to find the
optimal solution of the VTRP is impractical if the value of
RC is large. In this paper, two heuristic algorithms named
as Positive Reconfiguration Heuristic Algorithm (PRHA) and
Conservative Reconfiguration Heuristic Algorithm (CRHA) are
proposed to solve the VTRP. Each of which consists of
three stages named as Preprocessing, Direct Adjustment, and
Indirect Adjustment. The flowcharts of the PRHA and CRHA
are shown in Figures 1 and 3, respectively. In this section,
the details of the proposed heuristic algorithms are described.
Fig. 1. Flowcharts of the PRHA.
A. Preprocessing
In the preprocessing, first, for the given current virtual
topology, a wavelength usage table (WUT) is constructed to
store the information of wavelengths usage of all fibers in
physical network. The WUT can be implemented by a two-
dimension array with size |E| × |W |. Let WUT (eij , k) = 1,
if the kth wavelength of the fiber eij is used by a lightpath of
virtual topology; WUT (eij , k) = 0, otherwise.
Let Ds,d be the sum of the delay of the primary and
backup lightpaths between nodes vs and vd on G(V,E′, wei),
that is, Ds,d is equal to dPsd + d
B
sd. For each pair of nodes
(vs, vd), vs, vd ∈ V , perform edge-disjoint shortest path algo-
rithm (EDSPA) on physical topology G(V,E, f) to find the
Disjoint Path Algorithm (EDPA) is proposed. The details of
the EDPA are shown as follows:
Edge-Disjoint Path Algorithm(EDPA)
Input: G(V,E, f), G′(V,E′, wei), vs, vd, LG
Output: two edge-disjoint paths or fail (when the resource is not sufficient)
Step 0: Construct the layered graph LG according to the current virtual topology G′.
Step 1: Perform Dijkstra Algorithm on LG to find the shortest routing path p1 from
S′ to D′.
Step 2: If (path p1 is found){
Remove edges of the shortest path p1 (except for edges in Link) from
wavelength graph Gl(V,E, f), l=1, 2, ..., w of layered graph LG.
Perform Dijkstra Algorithm on LG to find the shortest routing path p2
from S′ to D′.
If (p2 is found)
return p1 and p2.
else
return fail.}
else
return fail.
If the EDPA algorithm fails to find a pair of edge-disjoint
paths on G, that is, current virtual topology cannot be recon-
figured by performing the Direct Adjustment, then the Indirect
Adjustment algorithm will be used to do the reconfiguration. If
the EDPA can find a pair of edge-disjoint paths between source
and destination nodes on layered graph, this means that the
virtual topology can be adjusted if the remaining r is greater
than rc, where r is the total number of reconfiguration action
can be performed (initially r is set to RC), rc (rc=1 or 2) is
the number of configuration actions needed for reconfiguring
these two lightpaths.
After performing the Direct Adjustment, the value of r
is decreased by rc. The details of the Direct Adjustment
algorithm are shown as follows:
Direct Adjustment (DA)
Input: si, di, r, [Tij ]n×n, G(V,E, f), G′(V,E′, wei)
Output: two edge-disjoint paths and the assigned wavelengths
Step 1: Perform EDPA on LG to find a pair of link-disjoint routing paths (p1, p2)
between si and di.
Step 2: If (fail to find paths) then
return fail;
else
compute the sum of delay of paths p1, p2 denoted as D(p1, p2) and
determine the value of rc.
Step 3: If (D(p1, p2) < Di) and (r > rc) then{
Change the routing paths of node pair (si, di) to p1, p2,
and subtract rc from r.
Update the layered graph LG, WUT and virtual topology.
return success.}
else
return fail.
D. Indirect Adjustment
For some pairs of nodes, performing EDPA may fail to
find pairs of edge-disjoint paths with lower delay due to
lack of network resources (including wavelengths, transmitter,
and/or receivers). This situation may be resolved by releasing
some resources possessed by some lightpaths in current virtual
topology. In the Indirect Adjustment, some lightpaths existing
in the current virtual topology will be selected to release
network resources so that the new logical link between the pair
of nodes can be established. It is worth noting that removing
lightpath from the virtual topology may disconnect the virtual
topology and may consume several configuration actions. To
determine the suitable lightpath(s) to be removed, the question
turns to “how to find a pair of edge-disjoint paths with lower
delay and with minimal conflicts to lightpaths in current virtual
topology such that after performing reconfiguration the AWPD
can be reduced as far as possible?” In this section, the details
of Indirect Assignment are described.
In Indirect Adjustment, first, the k-SSLDP algorithm is
used to find a set of k mutual edge-disjoint paths EDPi =
{pi1, pi2, ..., pik} for the ith selected pair of nodes (vsi , vdi) on
physical topology. Let delay(pij) be the delay of the p
i
j . Then,
two paths in EDPi which satisfy constraints are selected as
the logical link between vsi and vdi . The details of the Indirect
Adjustment are described as follows:
Indirect Adjustment
Input: si, di, r, T , G(V,E, f), G′(V,E′, wei)
Output: two edge-disjoint paths and updated virtual topology
Step 1: Perform k-SSLDP algorithm on physical topology G(V,E, f) to find k link-
disjoint paths P i = {pi1, pi2, ..., pik} for the pair of nodes (si, di).
Step 2: For the set EDPi and WUT , perform LCPFA to select a pair of link-disjoint
paths (pix, p
i
y ) with minimal rf , where rf is the number of lightpaths in
G′(V,E′, wei) which conflict with (p1, p2).
Step 3: If (found)
{
Compare paths (pix, p
i
y) with the original paths to determine the difference
rc.
Change the routing paths of node pair (si, di) to pix, p
i
y , and subtract
rc + rf from r.
Update the WUT and virtual topology.
}
else
return fail;
The selected paths are determined by performing the Least
Conflict Paths Finding Algorithm (LCPFA). In LCPFA, first,
a k×w integral matrix Conflict[j, l]k×w is constructed. The
value of element Conflict[j, l] is used to store the number
of occurred conflicts if lightpath pij in EDPi is assigned to
wavelength l, j=1, 2, ..., k; l=1, 2, ..., w. Then, from all
the possible feasible paths, find two paths with smaller delay
and conflicts, and when adding two paths into current virtual
topology and removing the conflict lightpaths, these actions
will not disconnect the virtual topology. The details of the
LCPFA is described as follows:
Least Conflict Paths Finding Algorithm (LCPFA)
Input: si, di, EDPi = {pi1, pi2, ..., pik}, WUT , r, G(V,E′, wei)
Output: two edge-disjoint paths or fail
Step 1: Construct the matrix Conflict.
Step 2: Let CF (j, l) denote the set of lightpaths in current virtual topology which
are conflict with path pij , if path p
i
j were assigned to wavelength l, j=1, 2,
..., k; l=1, 2, ..., w.
For the following cases the Conflict[j, l] is set to ∞.
Case 1: If removed paths in CF (j, l) and added path pij on wavelength l
′
disconnected
the virtual topology.
Case 2: If delay(pij) greater than the delay of current lightpath.
Case 3: If Conflict[j, l] greater than the current reconfiguration constraint r.
Step 3: Find a path in EDPi (say pix) and the assigned wavelength l with smallest
value of ( Conflict(j, l), delay(pix)) (in lexicographical order) and with
Conflict(j, l′) <∞.
Step 4: If (pix found) then{
Remove pix from EDPi.
Update Conflict and CF and perform Steps 2 and 3 to find a path
(say piy) in EDPi (say p
i
y) and the assigned wavelength l
′ with
smallest value of ( Conflict(j, l′), delay(piy)) (in lexicographical
order) and with Conflict(j, l′) <∞.
If (piy found) then
return (pix, p
i
y ) and rf = Conflict(x, l) + Conflict(y, l
′);
else
return fail.}
else
return fail.

constraint, (a) PRHA on N1, (b) PRHA on N2.
Observation from these figures shows that the reducing ratio
can be decreased as the given r or TR increased. The reducing
ratio is of little significance if the TR > 14.
Fig. 6(a) and (b) show the experimental results of CRHA
on networks N1 and N2 with different number of wavelengths
(w), respectively. Observation from these figures shows that
the reducing ratio can be decreased as the given r or w
increased. Fig. 7(a) and (b) show the experimental results
of CRHA on networks N1 and N2 with different number
of transceivers (TR = TXi = RXi,∀vi ∈ V ), respectively.
Observation from these figures shows that the reducing ratio
can be decreased as the given r or TR increased. The major
difference between Fig. 7 (b) and Fig. 5 (b) is that the
reducing ratio of CRHA can be reduced more than PRHA
if the TR > 14.
Fig. 8(a) and (b) show the comparison of PRHA and
CRHA on networks N1 and N2 with different number of
wavelengths (w), respectively. Observation from Fig. 8(a)
shows that CRHA can get better performance than PRHA.
But in Fig. 8(b) PRHA can get better performance than
CRHA. Because the spare resource in N1 is less than N2,
thus CRHA will have more chance to reconfigure more node
pairs. Fig. 9(a) and (b) show the comparison of PRHA and
CRHA on networks N1 and N2 with different number of
transceivers (TR), respectively. Observation from these figures
shows that CRHA can get better performance than PRHA
when the TR = 18. But in the cases TR = 10 PRHA can get
better performance than CRHA.
Fig. 10 shows the CPU time in microsecond of PRHA,
CRHA on network N2 with different number of reconfigu-
ration (r). CRHA can run faster than CRHA.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we studied the virtual topology reconfiguration
problem (VTRP) on WDM networks. A new problem model
was defined which combines the survivability and reconfigu-
ration. Given the physical topology, dedicated path-protected
virtual topology and a new traffic demand matrix, the goal
is to reconfigure current virtual topology to generate a new
one under the pre-specified reconfiguration constraint (r, a
positive integer) so as to minimize the objective value, which
is the average weighted propagation delay (AWPD). Because
designing a polynomial time algorithm to find the optimal
solution of VTRP is impractical when the reconfiguration
constraint RC is larger, two heuristic algorithms are proposed
here to solve it. They are Positive Reconfiguration Heuristic
Algorithm (PRHA) and Conservative Reconfiguration Heuris-
tic Algorithm (CRHA). Experiment results reveal that the
objective value can be decreased effectively by using proposed
heuristic algorithms.
