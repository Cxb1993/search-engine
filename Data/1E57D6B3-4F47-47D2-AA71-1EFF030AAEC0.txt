SH-SAW and chemical interface. The properties of chemical interface will be changed due to the interaction between 
interface and specific element. The interactions of SH-SAW and chemical interface then give the rise to phase velocity 
and attenuation responses of the acoustic wave. The shifts in velocity and attenuation are recorded by the frequency and 
insertion loss, respectively. 
 
The chemical interfaces for detecting ammonia generally include metal-oxide and polymer films. Metal-oxide 
materials present a sensitive response to ammonia as they are operated at high temperature (100-300oC). Rout et al. [1] 
have reported the ammonia sensors based on ZnO nanoparticles and SnO2 nanostructures sensitively responded to a 
wide range of ammonia concentrations (1–800 ppm). A sensor array consisting of discrete metal-oxides, i.e. SnO2, ZnO, 
WO3, CuO, and In2O3, has been successfully used to detect NO, ammonia, SO2, and other gaseous pollutants [2]. Pt 
doped SnO2 materials have been shown high sensitivity to ammonia gas and stability [3]. MoO3 has been shown to be 
highly sensitive to ammonia, and the sensitivity depends on materials prepared processing [4]. The polymers are 
superior to metal-oxide films in their high sensitivity, low detection limit, and the ability in operating at room 
temperature. Most conducting polymers are sensitive to redox-active gases and organic vapors [5-7]. Swelling effect, 
which can cause electrical resistance change, often occurs in conducting polymer layers. Polyaniline (PANI) is a 
conducting polymer and has a good electrical sensitivity to ammonia, so it has been used in electronic nose. S. Christie 
et al. have reported the application of electrochemically-prepared polyaniline films for the measurement of gaseous 
ammonia at telecom 1300 nm LED [8]. Based on the infrared spectra of L-glutamic acid hydrochloride, a reaction has 
occurred between the carboxyl group and ammonia to produce the ammonium salt of the carboxylic acid. Therefore, in 
our past researches, we studied the detection properties of SAW sensors to ammonia based on L-glutamic acid 
hydrochloride to ammonia in dry air [9–11]. The detection limit of the L-glutamic acid hydrochloride sensor for 
ammonia was less than 0.90 ppm ammonia. 
 
In this study, the estimations of ammonia concentration by using NN SH-SAW sensors were studied. Three 
different NN models were used as the estimators. A reliable and superior NN SH-SAW identifier is expected to be found 
for effectively overcoming the interference of humidity in ammonia detection. All NN models are composed of a 
four-layered feed-forward fully connected network which size is 2-4-4-1. The basic architecture of NN model is shown 
in Fig. 1. The detailed NN model and its learning algorithm are reported in Section 2. Section 3 presents the 
experiments of SH-SAW sensors. The simulations and results are presented in Section 4, and then a conclusion is made 
in Section 5. 
 
2. Neural Network Models 
 
As mentioned above, all NN models are composed of a four-layered feed-forward fully connected network. Three 
types of activation function, including sigmoid function, modified hyperbolic tangent function and ns-level sigmoid 
function, are used in the nodes of NN models, respectively. Their math forms are expressed as follows. 
)exp(1/1)( xxf −+=                  (2-1)

In each NN model, different layers could be composed of different types of node. But, each layer certainly is composed 
of the nodes having same activation function. To effectively distinguish the layers with different nodes, the layer formed 
by sigmoid function nodes is named SNN layer, the layer formed by modified hyperbolic tangent function nodes is 
named MNN layer, and the layer formed by ns-level sigmoid function nodes is named QNN layer. According to the 
structure of neural layer, the learning rules of NN models could be summarized as follows [12-14].  
 
We denote )(kS j  as the desired output and )(ky j  as the actual output of node j of the output layer on the 
presentation pattern k. 
To SNN layer, the weight’s adjustment is computed as follows. 
For the output node j, 
))()(()( kykSk jjij −∝∆ω )())(1)(((* kxkyky ijj −             (2-4)

where, )(kijω∆  is the weight adjustment between node j and its input )(kxi  in the layer below. )(klδ  is the error 
term feedback from node l in the layer above node j. 
 
aperture was 750µm, length of reflector was 1400µm, and length of cavity was 1148µm. We applied a dual-device 
configuration to eliminate the environment effects such as pressure, temperature, flow rate, etc. Fig. 2 illustrates a 
dual-device configuration with two SH-SAW resonators. One resonator is a sensing device and the other is as the 
reference. This dual-device configuration was bonded on a printed circuit board and was coated the absorber on both 
ends. 
 
There are two kinds of chemically sensitive interfaces. One is L-glutamic acid hydrochloride and the other one is 
PANI. A known quantity of L-glutamic acid hydrochloride (Aldrich, USA) was weighed and dissolved in a known 
volume of deionized water at 75°C, to a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. A coating of L-glutamic acid hydrochloride was 
deposited on the surface of SH-SAW sensing device, named “Sensor A”, by air brushing. On the other hand, PANI 
powders were dissolved in N-methyl pyrrolidinone (NMP) solvent at a weight ratio of 0.1. The mixed solution was 
agitated for 48 h continuously, and then filtered. A PANI coating layer was sprayed on the surface of SH-SAW sensing 
device, named “Sensor B”. 
 
This dual-device configuration was put into a sealed 5 cm3 sensing chamber, which is controlled by a 
temperature-controller to ensure temperature stability with ± 0.01oC and has electronic oscillator circuits to generate RF 
signals. The RF electronic oscillator circuit is plotted in Fig. 3. Fig. 4 shows the oscillation frequency of SH-SAW 
resonator, which was measured by the spectrum (4395A, Agilent, USA), was stably at 148.86MHz.  
 
In this work, the dry nitrogen was as carrier gas and controlled the relative humidity. A gaseous ambience was 
controlled by the mass flow controller (Sierra, USA) on the flow rate of 110 ml/min. For achieving the better 
performance of chemical interfaces, the detection using “Sensor A” was operated at 50°C and the detection using 
“Sensor B” was operated at 23°C, respectively. A frequency counter, which was connected to a computer system via a 
RS-232 interface board, monitored the frequency shifts of SH-SAW sensors.  
 
4. Simulations and Results 
 
It is known that the responses of sensor cannot be described by a simple linear combination of the individual 
responses to dry ammonia and humidity [10-12]. To effectively identify ammonia in humid environment, the non-linear 
identifier which can catch the complex relationship between ammonia and its possible influence factors is needed. In 
this study, three NN models with different structures were used as the estimators for ammonia in humidity. Here, these 
three NN models are named Model-1, Model-2 and Model-3, respectively. Their structures are shown in Fig. 5. In this 
study, a reliable and superior intelligent identifier is expected to be found for effectively overcoming the interference of 
humidity in ammonia detection. The inputs of NN models are the humidity and the frequency shift, and the output is the 
concentration of ammonia.  
 
In our simulations, the data sensed by Sensor A and Sensor B are called Data-A and Data-B, respectively. For 
demonstrating the feasibility of NN models employed, Data-A and Data-B were randomly re-organized to four different 
data sets individually. They are named Set-A1, Set-A2, Set-A3 Set-A4, Set-B1, Set-B2, Set-B3 and Set-B4.  
 
For the data sets of Data-A, 44 points were used for NN’s training and 8 points were used for testing. For the data sets 
of Data-B, 81 points were used for NNs training and 9 points were used for testing. The mean absolute error (MAE) 
over all test data is used as the measurement of NN’s performance.  
 
The error statistics of performance by using three NN models are listed in Table 1 to Table 6, respectively. From 
the results shown, the total average errors of Data-A performed by three NN models are 1.61 ppm for Model-1, 1.49 
ppm for Model-2 and 0.92 ppm for Model-3. The total average errors of Data-B performed by three NN models are 
10.69 ppb for Model-1, 11.45 ppb for Model-2 and 4.19 ppb for Model-3. For both data sets, it could be obviously 
found that the best estimation accuracy can be obtained by using Model-3. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
In this study, humidity interference on the SH-SAW ammonia sensors coated with L-glutamic acid hydrochloride 
and PANI film, respectively, were studied. Three different NN models were used as the identifier to estimate the 
ammonia in humid air. From the performance results shown, the NN models we proposed indeed can effectively 
perform the estimation of ammonia in a common ambience and overcome the inference of humidity caused. Among 
these three NN models, the NN model having QNN layer obtains the best estimation result. It is concluded that the 
complex relationships between ammonia and humidity interference for various humid environments can be classified 
more effectively by multi-level hidden nodes so that NN Model-3 could easily and accurately estimate the concentration 
of ammonia. It promotes such a sensor with neural technique in the practical applications. In addition, the results also
