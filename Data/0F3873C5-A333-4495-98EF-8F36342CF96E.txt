Hui-Wen Liao, and Hsim-Wei Huang, " A Multiple Watermarking Scheme for Gray-Level 
Imagines Using Visual Cryptography and Integer Wavelet Transform," Journal of Computers,

 and the color decomposition method, Hou [11] presented three methods for visual cryptography. These methods 
can deal with both gray level and color images. An improved (2,2) visual secret sharing scheme using circular 
shares was presented by Wu and Chang [12]. The confidential data can be embedded in different angles. Unlike 
the traditional visual cryptography, this scheme can be used to embed two set of confidential messages. 
 Digital watermarking embedded technique can be classified as the spatial domain technology and frequency 
domain technology. The spatial domain embedded technique is to modify the pixel of image directly. The em-
bedded information or hidden data is stored in the unimportant bit, for example the last significant bit (LSB) 
technique. This technique has less computation time; however its security and robustness are low. Using the 
concept of image difference, Wu and Tsai presented a spatial domain data hiding scheme [13]. They used the 
pixel values difference method to embed the secret information in a gray level cover image. However, the hiding 
capacity of cover image is limited. In order to improve this disadvantage, Chang, Chuang, and Hu [14] presented 
a new spatial domain image hiding scheme, which hides secret information in variations of two consecutive gray 
scale pixels. The experimental results showed that this hiding capacity is about 84% over Wu and Tsai’s data 
hiding scheme. A generalized novel lossless LSB data embedding scheme was presented by Celik, Gaurav, Te-
kalp and Saber [15], which introduced the additional operating points on the capacity distortion curve.  
The frequency domain embedded technique is to transform data from the spatial domain into frequency do-
main and then embedded the hidden data in the image. Using the inverse transform, the embedded information is 
in the image. The discrete cosine transform (DCT), discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and the Fourier trans-
form (FT) are commonly used in the frequency domain embedded technique. The discrete wavelet transform can 
strength the ability of resistance under attacks, the wavelet tree can increase the security, and the modified histo-
gram can increase the unambiguousness of watermarks. Based on the DCT method, Chang, Yeh, and Hsiao [16] 
proposed a scheme for the copyright protection of images, and which does not actually hide the watermark in the 
image. Their scheme is extremely applicable for multiple watermarking, and the experimental results showed 
that the scheme is strongly robust against various kinds of image processing attacks. Using the error diffusion 
halftoning and a non-expansion visual cryptography model, Luo, Zhao, Pan and Lu [17] presented a scheme of 
joint multiple watermarking. The non-expansion visual secret sharing model is used to encrypt the halftone im-
age. In data extraction, only exclusive-OR operation is neededin this scheme, and the experimental results 
showed the scheme is effective and practical. Based on the integer wavelet transform method, Yuan, Huang and 
Liu [18] presented a multiple logo-watermarking scheme for copyright protection of digital image. The permuta-
tion is used to increase the security of the watermark. The experimental results showed that this scheme is robust 
to a wide variety of attacks. Based on the joint DWT and DCT transformation, Kasmani and Naghsh-Nilchi [19] 
presented a new robust digital image watermarking scheme. They used the DWT transform to the host image, 
and performing the DCT to the selected DWT middle frequency subbands to embed the watermarks, which can 
increase the imperceptibility and robustness. The results showed that the imperceptibility of the watermarking 
image is acceptable. 
In this paper, we present a multiple watermarking scheme for gray-level imagines by using visual cryptogra-
phy, modified histogram, integer wavelet transform, and the wavelet tree. Under this scheme, all owners will 
have dual watermark authentication, and through this method, the number of ownerships can be increased. The 
goal of the proposed scheme for multiple watermarking is to satisfy more requirements of the characteristics. 
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly reviews the related works of the traditional (2, 2) visual 
secret scheme, wavelet transform, and histogram modification proposed scheme. In Section 3, we describe de-
tails of the proposed multiple watermarking schemes. In Section 4, we present the experimental results. In Sec-
tion 5, we present different analytic models. Finally, Section 6 summarizes the contributions of this paper. 
2 Related Works 
The visual cryptography scheme is presented by Naor and Shamir (1994). They used the ),( nt -threshold )( nt   
scheme, that is, a visual variant of the t  out of n  user secret sharing problem. Each user can have his own 
transparency, only t   of them can see the image by stacking his own transparency, but 1t   of them cannot get 
any information. The characteristic of (2, 2)-threshold visual cryptography scheme is shown in Fig. 1. 
 
 
 coefficient in a wavelet transform is insignificant, its descendant coefficients in the higher frequency subbands 
are insignificant. He used the parents-children relationship to describe the highest and lowest frequency sub-
bands. Based on the concept of zerotrees of wavelet coefficients, Cho and Pearlman [22], and Khan [23] pre-
sented more efficient performance on coding. Kundur and Hatzinakos [24] presented a technique for the digital 
watermarking based on the concept of multi-resolution wavelet fusion. The algorithm is robust to a variety of 
signal distortions. Simulation results show the superior performance of the technique and demonstrate its poten-
tial for the robust watermarking of photographic imagery.  Wang and Lin [25] proposed a wavelet tree quantiza-
tion for copyright protection watermarking. The wavelet coefficients of the host image are grouped into so-
called super trees. The watermark is embedded by quantizing super trees. Our method used the concept of wave-
let tree. Fig.4. illustrates the grouping 3-level wavelet coefficients that correspond to the same spatial area.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3 The Proposed Multiple Watermarking Scheme 
Based on the cryptography and discrete integer wavelet transform, we present a watermarking scheme for mul-
tiple host-image owners in this paper.  Assume WA  is a host-image share as embedded in the protected gray-level 
image, and BiShare  is a private share as key of host-image owner Bi . All owners Bi  can verify their dual 
watermarks but others, and through this method, the number of ownerships can be increased. The relation be-
tween WA and owners is shown in Fig. 5.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.1. Embedding Procedure  
The diagram of proposed embedding procedure is consisting of generating shares WA and ShareBi  by visual 
cryptography, integer wavelet transformation, and embedding in protected gray-level image as shown in Fig.6.

Integer Wavelet Transformation. The image histogram modification [50] is used to prevent grayscales from 
possible overflow. The overflowing may happen due to data embedding, that is, the grayscale value has to be 
between 0 and 255. Therefore, the following algorithm is chosen to check the overflowing problem:

Based on Haar wavelet transform, Calderbank [48], Heer[49], and Xuan[50][51][52][53] presented the integ-

Embedding Algorithm. In our embedding procedure, first we adopt histogram modification to prevent the 
overflow and underflow problem. Then the modified histogram transform into 2-level wavelet. Finally, we 
embed  rWA  into the coefficients of bands 2HL  and 1HL (i.e. rWA  is the rearranging host-image share by ran-
dom seed rK ), the frequency band 2HL  corresponds to the frequency band 1HL  was shown in Equation (5). 
The wavelet coefficient d  and secret information w  could be obtained from a gray-level host image H ( 2HL  
and 1HL ).

4 Experimental results 
In our experiments, the protected image (host-image) H  belongs to owners 1B  and 2B , which have dual wa-
termark authentication. The 512*512 gray-level image H  in Fig. 8(a) is used as an original host image. The 
64*64 binary images「嶺東科大」and「Ling Tung」 in  Fig. 8(b), and 「資訊科技」and「研究所」in Fig.  
8(c) are used as the watermarks of the host-image owners 1B  and 2B , respectively. In our embedding proce-
dure and extraction procedure, modulus   and modification parameter   are 17 and 3/4, respectively.

 gray-level image be between 0 and 255. Then, we apply 2-level integer wavelet transform (IWT) to obtain the 
corresponding frequency bands of IWTH as shown in Fig.10. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step3. Generating Share WA  and rWA .  Generate WA randomly by four kinds of 2*2 subpixel expansion pat-
terns
jWA  as shown in Table 1. And arrange the pixels of  WA  by using random seed rK  into rWA  as embedding 
share to increase safety as shown in Fig.11. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step4. Embedding rWA  into the coefficients of bands 2HL  and 1HL . Let 41d  be a wavelet coefficient of 
HL2 or HL1, 1w  be one embedded pixel of  rWA , the modulus 17 , and the modification parameter 
4/3 , then, by embedding Algorithm equation(6) and (7), we can get 7r , 34v , 12n . Finally, we 
can obtain the modification wavelet coefficient 46'v by equation (8). We embed each pixel of rWA  into 5 spa-
tial areas as shown in Equation (5). For example, let the pixel of the coordinate )1,1(  of rWA  be 1w , the five 
coefficients of frequency bands are 422 )1,1( HL , ),(1 jiHL , 521 )1,1( HL , 341 )2,1( HL , 521 )1,2( HL , 
231 )2,2( HL , we can get the data of ,r ,v  and 'v  as shown in Table 5.

 Step2. Extracting 'rWA . The  BiW '1  and  BiW '2  are extracted watermarks by extraction algorithm in Equation 
(9). If 2/)1(  m , then the pixel of jirWA ,'  is equal to 1; on the other hand, if 2/)1(  m , then the pixel of 
jirWA ,'  is 0. For example, choosing the coefficient bands of '1HL  and '2HL ,  if the five coefficients of 
frequency bands of extraction are 46'2 )1,1( HL , 63'1 )1,1( HL  , 46'1 )2,1( HL  , 63'1 )1,2( HL , 63'1 )1,2( HL , 
29'1 )2,2( HL , we get the data of |,| d  ,'r  and m  as shown in Table 6. For example, if the value ,12m  then the 
pixel of the coordinates )1,1(  of host-image share after extraction will be 1 (i.e. 1' 1,1 rWA ). 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step3. Reconstruction of 'WA . 'rK  is the inverse of rK , 'WA  is the rearranged host-image share from 'rWA . 
Reconstruct the pixels of  'rWA  by using the inverse random seed rK  into 'WA  as shown in Fig.14. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step4. Decrypting by Visual Cryptography. Superimposing share 'WA  on share 1BShare  will result the share 
1'1 BW (i.e. 1||' BShareWA ) . This is the 1st watermark of the host-image owner 1B  after extraction as shown in 
Fig. 15(a). And let 'jWA  be the subblock 2*2 of 'WA , ''WA  is rotating each subblock clockwise 
90  of  'jWA  
(i.e. )( jWARS  ), then superimposing ''WA  on 1BShare  resulting the share 1'2 BW (i.e. 1||'' BShareWA ), which 
can be shown in Fig. 15(b). Similarly, we can obtained 2'1 BW  and 2'2 BW  (i.e. 2||' BShareWA , 2||'' BShareWA ), 
as shown in Fig. 16.

5 Experimental analysis 
It is a very subjective judgment of the quality for the image through the human visual system. In order to eva-
luate the quality of the protected image under various images processing, we use the peak signal-to-noise ratio 
(PSNR) estimation as follows.

in which ija  and ijb  denote the pixels of the coordinate ),( ji  of original image and watermarked image, respec-
tively; h and w  are the height and wide of images. In general, the value of PSNR greater then 30 dB has good 
quality of image. 
In addition, we also introduce the tamper assessment function (TAF) to estimate the watermarks after extrac-
tion. TAF can be used to verify the difference of the original image and watermarked image. The value of TAF 
will be between 0 and 1.The smaller TAF will be better, the watermarking will be perfect as the TAF value ap-
proaches zero.

ly. 
 
The quality of the watermarked image and the watermarks after extraction depends on how the values of 
modulus   and modification parameter   we have been chosen. In our embedding procedure and extraction 
procedure, modulus   and modification parameter   are 17 and 3/4 respectively, under the condition of no 
attacking,  we can obtain Watermarked image 'H  by proposed embedding method and four watermarks after 
extraction for owner 1B  and 2B  by proposed extraction method, and we obtain PSNR=37.097 for the water-
marked image, and TAF=0 for watermarks after extraction as shown in Fig. 18.

5.4 Restoring the Size of Watermarks by Four Points Distinguishing Rule.  
In this section, we apply the “four points distinguishing rule” to restore the size of origin watermarks, since 3 
blacks and 1 white are restored into one white pixel, 4 blacks are restored into one black pixel. The shares 
generated by visual cryptography having the particles, the rule could eliminate this phenomenon to increase the
