rate constant ratio of GeH4 adsorption 
on Si*-Si over Ge*-Ge at 650°C is 2.1,

Abstract
tion paths consist of direct interactions between the precur-
sors and the growing SiGe alloy surface. Silane SiH4 and
SiGe heteroepitaxy, and their dissociative adsorptions are
dangling bonds for dissociative adsorption which becomes
a critical step. The dependence of growth rate on the GeH4
content is not monotonic under high temperatures, the
growth rate increases with the GeH4 content in the low
concentration range, reaches a maximum, and decreases

Surface Science 600 (2006The growth kinetics of SiGe heteroepitaxial thin ﬁlm is
of importance in the semiconductor industry since SiGe/
Si(100) heterostructures allow band-gap engineering on
high-speed devices in conjunction with the established sili-
con technology. The SiGe epitaxial growth is generally car-
ried out using either gas-source molecular beam epitaxy or
ultrahigh vacuum chemical vapor deposition [1–4]. These
techniques typically employ conditions of high vacuum
and low precursor pressure, hence gas-phase reactions are
hardly involved in the growth kinetics. Major surface reac-
the starting points of surface reaction paths.
It is known that GeH4 inclusion in the precursor source
changes the silicon hydride deposition kinetics. For in-
stance, an addition of 10% GeH4 was reported to accelerate
the SiH4 growth rate on Si(100) by a factor of 25 at 550 C
[5]. The acceleration eﬀect at low growth temperatures
(6600 C) originates from the Ge assistance in surface
hydrogen desorption, which is the rate-determining step
[6–8]. At high growth temperature (P650 C), desorption
of hydrogen is suﬃciently fast, opening up most sites ofSiH4 and GeH4 dissociative adsorptions on a buckled SiGe(100)-2 · 1 surface have been analyzed using density functional theory
(DFT) at the B3LYP level. The Ge alloying in the Si(100)-2 · 1 surface aﬀects the dimer buckling and its surface reactivity. Systematic
Ge inﬂuences on the reaction energetics are found in SiH4 and GeH4 reactions with four dimers of Si*–Si, Ge*–Si, Ge*–Ge, and Si*–Ge
(* denotes the protruded atom). On a half H-covered surface, the energy barriers for silane and germane adsorption are higher than those
on the pristine surface. The energy barrier for silane adsorption is higher than the corresponding barrier for germane adsorption. Rate
constants are also calculated using the transition-state theory. We conclude that the SiGe surface reactivity in adsorption reaction
depends on the Ge presence in dimer form. If the surface Ge is present in form of Ge*–Ge, the surface reactivity decreases as the
Ge*–Ge content increases. If the surface Ge prefers to be in form of Ge*–Si at low Ge contents, the surface reactivity increases ﬁrst, then
decreases at high Ge surface contents when Ge*–Ge prevails. The calculated rate constant ratio of GeH4 adsorption on Si*–Si over Ge*–
Ge at 650 C is 2.1, which agrees with the experimental ratio of GeH4 adsorption probability on Si(100) over Si(100) covered by one
monolayer Ge. The experimental ratio is 1.7 measured through supersonic molecular beam techniques. This consistency between calcu-
lation and experimental results supports that one monolayer of Ge on Si(100) exists in form of Ge*–Ge dimer.

SiSi13H18 is more stable. Jenkins and Srivastava [27], and
Miwa [28] calculated the total energy of mixed Si–Ge dimer
surface using the so-called supercell methods and found
that the conﬁguration with a Ge atom in the up position
was energetically favorable compared with the Si-up con-
ﬁguration. They also showed that energy of the Si–Ge
dimer was lower than those of Si–Si and Ge–Ge dimers.
These theoretical results are consistent with the high reso-
lution photoemission spectra results of Patthey and his
coworkers [29,30].
Dimer bond lengths and buckle angles of Si*–SiSi13H18,
Ge*–SiSi13H18, Ge*–GeSi13H18 of this work, along with the
reported values in the literature [27–35], are listed in Table
2. The dimer bond length is the distance between two dimer
atoms. The buckle angle is the angle between the dimer and
the nominal surface plane, which is deﬁned by the second
Si layer in a cluster. Again, our results of Si*–Si, Ge*–Si,
Ge*–Ge bond lengths and tilt angles using 6-311G*, 6-
311+G*, and 6-311++G** are generally in line with the
experimental results and other theoretical results, much
better than those results using the low level basis sets.
Therefore we conclude that using a basis set higher than
the Pople triple-zeta basis (6-311G) is crucial in the DFT
calculation of SiGe cluster at the B3LYP level. Basis sets
lower than 6-311G, either with polarization functions or

3196 C.-L. Cheng et al. / Surface Science 600 (2006) 3194–3201more than two Ge surface atoms are also used in calcula-
tion, but the results are supplementary since the diﬀerences
are small. The surface of Si15xGexH18 cluster has one
dimer with two dangling bonds and the other dimer passiv-
ated with hydrogen, while that of Si15xGexH16 cluster is a
pristine surface with two dimers of four dangling bonds.
Only the dimer of dangling bonds is considered in SiH4
and GeH4 adsorption reaction. The truncated bulk Si–Si
bonds are terminated with 16 Si–H bonds to preserve the
sp3 hybridization of the subsurface Si atoms.
When the importance of dimer reactant needs to be
emphasized, the ﬁrst two elements of cluster notation de-
note the dimer on which SiH4 or GeH4 is adsorbed. Since
a dimer of dangling bonds is buckled (or tilted), a star sign
is used to denote the protruded atom of the buckled dimer
involved in adsorption. For example, Ge*-SiSi13H18 has a
buckled Ge*–Si dimer and the Ge atom is a protruded
atom. Ge*–GeSi13H16 cluster has a buckled Ge*–Ge dimer,
the Ge*–Ge dimer is involved in adsorption and the other
Si–Si dimer of dangling bonds is not involved in adsorp-
tion. This paper mainly discusses eight surface clusters,
which are Si*–SiSi13H18, Ge*–SiSi13H18, Si*–GeSi13H18,
Ge*–GeSi13H18, Si*–SiSi13H16, Ge*–SiSi13H16, Si*–Ge-
Si13H16, and Ge*–GeSi13H16. Structures of four optimized
clusters are illustrated in Fig. 1.
Geometry optimizations of the clusters were performed
without artiﬁcial symmetric or geometric constraints. The
B3LYP three-parameter hybrid exchange-correlation func-
tional was employed for all the DFT calculations [23–25].
Unscaled zero-point energies were also evaluated at the
same level. Si*–SiSi13H16 was the ﬁrst cluster being opti-
mized by removing four surface hydrogen atoms from an
optimized structure of Si15H20. Other clusters were subse-
quently optimized after substituting surface Si with Ge,
or adding surface hydrogen to Si*–SiSi13H16. One SiH4 or
GeH4 molecule was placed on top of a dimer, and the
geometry of reactant adduct was optimized again. The
transition state (TS) structure was obtained by following
a pseudo-reaction coordinate, and the ﬁrst-order saddle
point was located using the Berny transition-state algo-
rithm. All calculations were performed using the Gaussian
03 suite of programs [26]. The deﬁnitions of activation en-
ergy barrier EA and reaction energy DERXN are illustrated
in Fig. 2.
3. Benchmark calculation
Equilibrium geometries of Si*–GeSi13H18 and Ge*–
SiSi13H18 were optimized at the B3LYP level using
6-31G*, 6-31G**, 6-31+G*, 6-311G*, 6-311+G*, and 6-
311++G** Pople basis sets as benchmark study. Table 1
compares values of the energy diﬀerence DE between opti-
mized isomers of Si*–GeSi13H18 and Ge*–SiSi13H18.
Results using the basis sets of 6-31G*, 6-31G**, and 6-
31+G* indicate Si*–GeSi13H18 is a more stable isomer.
On the contrary, results using the higher level basis sets
*of 6-311G*, 6-311+G*, and 6-311++G** show that Ge –Fig. 2. Potential energy diagram of a typical adsorption reaction (GeH4+

charge diﬀerence is 0.234 (Si*–Si) < 0.331 (Ge*–Si) < 0.344

er, 0.361 (Si*–Si) < 0.376 (Ge*–Si) < 0.390 (Ge*–Ge). Both
increase with the number of Ge atoms.
4.2. Dissociative adsorption of SiH4 and GeH4
As an example, Fig. 2 illustrates the TS geometry of dis-
sociative adsorption GeH4 on the cluster Ge*–SiSi13H18 via
scission of a Ge–H bond. The optimized TS geometry
shows that the H atom of GeH4 is abstracted by a positive
down Si atom, simultaneously the Ge atom of GeH4 is
interacting with a negative up Ge atom in dimer. The reac-
tion mechanism was investigated by Brown and Doren [19]
on SiH4 adsorption on the Si(100)-2 · 1 pristine surface.
They predicted an energy barrier of 12–14 kcal/mol,
can be understood in view of bond breaking and bond for-
mation. The Si–H(g) is the bond being cleaved in SiH4
adsorption. Two new bonds Si–SiH3(a) and Si–H(a) are
formed on the Si*–Si dimer. When the dimer is Ge*–Si,
two new bonds are Ge–SiH3(a) and Si–H(a). When the
dimer is Ge*–Ge, two newly formed bonds are Ge–SiH3(a)
and Ge–H(a). Since the bond strength of Ge–SiH3(a) bond is
less than that of Si–SiH3(a) bond, and that of Ge–H(a) bond
is less than that of Si–H(a) bond, the value of reaction
energy decreases with more Ge in the dimer. On the other
hand, if the reaction energy of SiH4 and that of GeH4 on
the same dimer are compared, the DERXN value of GeH4
adsorption is always less because less energy is required
3198 C.-L. Cheng et al. / Surface Science 600 (2006) 3194–3201depending on details of the theoretical model. This four-
center TS was also the vital geometry in studying chloro-
silane adsorption on the Si(100)-2 · 1 pristine surface via
scission of one Si–Cl bond [36]. In this study, TS of SiH4
and GeH4 adsorbed on the Si1xGex clusters have been
searched at diﬀerent dimers. For all cases being calculated,
the only negative frequency of TS falls in the range of 330–
450 cm1. Inspection of the normal mode corresponding to
the negative eigenvalue shows that the reaction coordinate
involves a concerted motion of the H atom away from the
Ge atom in GeH4 with motion of the Ge atom towards the
another dimer atom.
Since the surface dimer is essentially charged, consisting
of an electrophilic down atom and a nucleophilic up atom,
the H-abstraction reaction is bound to occur between the
down atom and the H atom. If we force the H atom of
Si–H or Ge–H bond to approach the up atom during a sad-
dle point search, the up atom of dimer sinks as the down
atom rises like a seesaw. Table 4 lists the activation energy
barrier EA and the reaction energy DERXN of SiH4 and
GeH4 dissociative adsorption on Si15xGexH18. When the
reaction energies of SiH4 adsorption on diﬀerent dimers
are compared, the DERXN value increases with the increas-
ing Ge atom in the dimer. The sequence in DERXN value

a The activation energy ﬁtted to RRKM model was 13.4 kcal/mol by
Xia et al. (J. Vac. Sci. Technol. A, 1995) on SiH4 dissociative adsorption
on Si(100).to break the Ge–H(g) bond. The binding energy of Ge–
H(g) bond has been estimated 84 kcal/mole, less than
90 kcal/mol of Si–H(g) bond in SiH4 [37]. Reaction energies
of SiH4 and GeH4 adsorption on the pristine surface are
listed in Table 5. Adsorption reaction energy on the pris-
tine surface follows the same trend in Table 4, but its
DERXN value is slightly higher.
The EA values, listed in Tables 4 and 5, do not follow the
trend of reaction energy because of the complexity in
dimers discussed earlier. The energy barrier for SiH4 or
GeH4 adsorption on the Ge*–Ge dimer is generally the
highest among three dimers on the cluster surface with
either two or four dangling bonds. The second lowest en-
ergy barrier is on Si*–Si dimer, and the lowest barrier is
on Ge*–Si dimer. This interesting result has insightful
implication in the growth kinetics and the grown SiGe
layer composition. Engstrom and his coworkers measured
the reaction probability of GeH4 using supersonic molecu-
lar beam techniques. They reported the reaction probabil-
ity of GeH4 on the zero H-coverage Si(100) was 2–5
times that of GeH4 on the zero-coverage Ge(100) surface
[11]. In another experiment, at substrate temperature
650 C when the surface hydrogen coverage could be ne-
glected, as the surface Ge content on Si(100) increased
from Ge zero coverage, the GeH4 reaction probability stea-
dily decreased with the increasing Ge surface content. The
highest barrier of GeH4 on a Ge*–Ge dimer in Tables 4 and
5 is generally in line with Engstrom’s conclusions.

desorption is suﬃciently fast, 650–800 C. The rate con-
stant of SiH4 or GeH4 is generally larger with a lower
energy barrier. The only exception is that the SiH4 adsorp-
tion rate constant on Ge*–GeSi13H16 is slightly larger
(instead of smaller) than that on Si*–SiSi13H16. The excep-
tion indicates that the partition function is a substantial
factor in rate constant when the energy barrier is relatively
small. The GeH4 rate constant ratio between Si*–Si and
Ge*–Ge is plotted in an inset of Fig. 3. The ratio decreases
as the growth temperature increases. The calculated GeH4
rate constant ratio is 2.14 at 650 C, slightly higher than the
experimental value 1.7, reported by Engstrom et al. [12].
The experimental ratio was estimated from the reaction
probabilities of 2.3 eV GeH4 molecules on a clean
Si(100) surface and a Si(100) surface covered by one Ge
monolayer at 650 C.
Similarly, theoretical rate constants of the SiH4 and
GeH4 adsorption on a half H-covered surface are plotted
in Fig. 4 in the temperature range of 500–650 C. Adsorp-
tion rates of GeH4 are clearly higher than those of SiH4

larger for a lower energy barrier, but exceptions in the
SiH4 adsorption rate constants do occur. We also check
the possible cross-dimer dissociative adsorption reaction
on the half H-covered surface. The reaction of SiH4
adsorption on Ge*–SiSi13H18 cluster in its diagonal direc-
tion is calculated. The activation energy is higher than that
of its corresponding on-dimer reaction by 8.3 kcal, and the
rate is slower by an order of magnitude.
The highest rate constant on a pristine surface is the
GeH4 adsorption on Ge*–SiSi13H16, while the slowest rate
constant is the SiH4 adsorption on Si*–GeSi13H16. On a
half H-covered surface, these two reactions are also the
fastest and the slowest. The rate constants are correlated
in the Arrhenius equation form. The correlated activation
energies and frequency factors are listed in Table 7.

adsorption on a half H-covered SiGe(100) surface.5. Summary
We have analyzed the inﬂuences of Ge alloying on the
dimer geometry and SiH4/GeH4 dissociative adsorption
on the Si(100)-2 · 1 surface theoretically. The calculation
was done on the clusters with two surface dimers which
are free from hydrogen coverage or one of two dimers is
H-covered. The dimer geometry becomes more buckled
when the number of Ge atoms in dimer increases. The di-
mer on a pristine surface is also more buckled than that
on a half H-covered surface. The value of reaction energy
generally increases with the number of Ge atoms in dimer.
The energy barrier of SiH4 and GeH4 adsorption is the
lowest on Ge*–Si, and highest on Ge*–Ge, without consid-
ering the less stable Si*–Ge dimer. The reaction energy and
energy barrier on Si*–Ge are still listed for reference. The
calculated rate constants generally follow the trend dic-
tated by the energy barriers. The calculation results not
only agree with the experimental results by supersonic
molecular beam techniques but also provide further details.
