operation wavelength of the Bragg fiber. The elliptical-hole photonic crystal structure 
acts as an anisotropic medium with different effective indices for transmission light of 
differently polarization, which inevitably results to high birefringence (up to the order 
of magnitude of0.01) of the Bragg fiber. The proposed Bragg fiber possesses different 
band-gaps for differently polarized mode. Besides the periodic alternating layers of 
high/low refractive indices, the bandwidth of the band-gap is also dependent on the 
effective index of the fiber core, which can be controlled by the area of the elliptical 
air holes. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) [1-3] which also include Bragg fibers have attracted 
increasing interest over the past decade because of their unique property, such as high 
birefringence, high nonlinearity, endlessly single-mode operation, single-polarization 
single-mode operation, and tailorable chromatic dispersion. Highly birefringent PCFs are one 
kind of extemely important PCFs which have promising applications in e.g. fiber sensors, 
fiber lasers, and fiber filters [4-5]. So far, various highly birefringent PCFs have been 
proposed [6-8]. Meanwhile, Bragg fibers have recently received much attention for their 
interesting dispersion and modal properties and for advances in fabrication techniques [9]. 
However, so far there is no report about birefringent Bragg fibers. In this letter, we propose a 
highly birefringent Bragg fiber with a fiber core of 2-dimension elliptical-hole photonic 
crystal (2D-EH-PhC) structure surrounded by a multilayer cladding with the suitable designed 
alternating layers of high/low refractive indices. High birefringence (up to the order of 
magnitude of 0.01) has been achieved and other characteristics of the proposed Bragg fiber 
have also been investigated. 
 
SIMULATION RESULTS AND ANALYSIS 
Figure 1 shows a quarter of the cross section of the proposed Bragg fiber with a fiber core of 
2D-EH-PhC structure. In the fiber core, the hole pitch   (the center-to-center distance 
between the two adjacent air holes) is 200 nm, which is much smaller than the operating 
wavelength of the Bragg fibers in this letter. The elliptical air holes are characterized by the 
normalized area  and ellipticity 2/S ab  /b a  , where a,b are the radius in x, y direction, 
respectively. The fiber core is encompassed by fifty periodic structures of alternating layers of 
high and low refractive indices in the fiber cladding. The thickness of the periodic structure 
formed by one high and one low refractive index layer is 387.5nm 
1 0.2176d
. In this paper, we 
choose high/low refractive index of 4.6/1.6, with thicknesses of    and  
(forming a 
2 0.7824d  
quarter wavelength waveguide stack for the wavelength within the optical fiber 
comminication window). The refractive index of the fiber core is set to be 1.45 (considering 
the silica materials). A full-vector finite-element method (FEM) and anisotropic perfectly

It is well known that the Bragg fiber with a hollow fiber core (or filled with uniform media) 
will not be birefringent because of the symmetry. The fiber core of 2D-EH-PhC structure 
results in the high birefringence. To understand the birefringence induced by elliptical air 
holes in the fiber, the effective indices of the 2D-EH-PhC material should be investigated 
carefully. The parameters of the 2D-EH-PhC structure we consider here are  and , 
as illustrated in the inset of Fig. 3(a). The refractive index of the fused silica is set to be 1.45. 
A plane-wave expansion method [19] is used to calculate the effective indices for the wave 
propagation along the z direction in the photonic crystal material, and the results are shown as 
a function of the normalized frequency 
2e  0.2s 
/    in Fig. 3(a), where the solid curve and dotted 
curve represent the effective indices for the y-polarized and x-polarized light waves, 
respectively. Large difference between the effective indices for differently polarized light 
waves is observed. Insets of Fig. 3(a) shows the cross section of the array of elliptical-hole in 
fused silica. Figure 3(b) shows the index differences when the normalized areas of the 
elliptical air holes are 0.1 (short dashed curve), 0.2 (solid curve) and 0.3 (dotted curve), 
respectively. For the photonic crystal material with a normalized area of 0.2, the birefringence 
reaches its maximum of about 0.0277 as the normalized frequency approaches zero (namely, 
 tends to zero for a given wavelength). This indicates the photonic crystal material can act 
as an (dispersive) anisotropic medium.

In conclusion, 2D-EH-PhC structure with with a hole pitch much smaller that the operation 
wavelength is investigated and introduced in the fiber core of the Bragg fiber. High 
birefringence (up to the order of 0.01) of the Bragg fiber has been achieved since the 
2D-EH-PhC structure can act as an anisotropic medium with different effective indices for 
transmission light of differently polarization. Birefringence property of the proposed Bragg 
fiber has been fully investigated for different mormalized areas or ellipticities of the elliptical 
air holes in the fiber core.

Abstract 
subwavelength grooves is proposed to introduce SPPs into microwave regime for 
reducing the crosstalk between transmission line circuits. A directional coupler, whose 
two strip lines are separated by a distance of the line width, is designed and simulated 
numerically and measured experimentally over the frequency range 200MHz~12GHz. 
The results from measurement and simulation are in good agreement. This type of 
structure has potential application in high density microwave circuit and EMC 
systems.

In order to verify that the new strip line structure can reduce the crosstalk, we make 
an experimental investigation for our coupled strip line circuit with four ports as 
shown in Fig. 4(a). The confinement strength of EM waves on this new transmission 
line can be analyzed through the S-parameter measurements with the ZVB8 VNA 
manufactured by R&S. Signal is injected from port 1 into the circuit, then the S 
parameters were measured at four ports. Coupling between the conventional 
microstrip line and the periodically corrugated metal stripline with two different 
periods  and 1.0 are measured individually formm5..0 mm 37.3r (Ro4003)
