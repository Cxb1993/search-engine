Abstract
The first year is placed on calculating the optimal geometrically structure which is obtained from
the experimental data or simulated annealing methods. Subsequently, analyze the dynamical
structurally behaviors of the δ-selective opioid ligands and define the δ-selective pharmacophore
model by using equilibrium and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. According to the
first year’s results, the following year is supposed to study the active structures of the κ-selective
opioid ligands and relevant pharmacophore model. For the dynamically structure-activity
relationship of the endogenous opioid system, this project has obtained some significant results.
These results would be providing some valuable information for drug design and clinical therapy.
Keywords: endogenous opioid system; pharmacophore
bonds for ω2 and ω4 (Figure 1) of αS1-CM are
significance, hence we selected two dihedral
angles as the criterion to calculate the structural
profile of the diverse conformers. First, the ω2
and ω4 were set to 0◦, and the 2025 conformer
distributions were obtained using the molecular
mechanics. In this step, we can acquire a
conformer of minimized energy. Subsequently,
the dihedral angles of amide bond, ω2 and ω4,
were mutual rotated by increments of 30◦, and
yielding 13 × 13 ＝ 169 conformers of the
minimized energy that repeat the above
technique. Finally, the 169 conformers of the
minimized energy are further calculated by
means of the AM1 method belongs to
semi-empirical calculation of the quantum
chemistry.
Molecular Dynamics Simulations
The MD simulations performed in this
study were carried out using the GROMACS
version 3.2 simulation program with the
GROMOS96 (ffG43a1) force field [9,10]
applied. The initial structure of αS1-CM was
prepared per lowest energy derived from the
AM1 calculations, and αS1-CM was simulated
to be surrounded by a total of 1205 water
molecules. The whole system of the aqueous
solution was contained within a cubic box with
a side of ca. 34 Å and periodic boundary
conditions. An energy minimized was used to
refine the initial structure of αS1-CM in aqueous
solution. The MD simulations were begun
assuming random velocity of the atoms that
followed a Maxwellian distribution at 300 K.
The atom positions and velocities were
integrated according to the standard Verlet
algorithm. The integration time step was
chosen as dt = 2fs. The system was first
equilibrated at 300 K and the constant pressure
relevant to the density of 1 bar. The Berendsen
coupling scheme is utilized to regulation of the
temperature and pressure with a time constant
of 0.2. After the equilibrations were achieved,
the time evolutions of all quantities considered
in this study were recorded, and the MD
simulations were continued for a simulating
time domain of 20 ns. In the simulations, the
Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method is applied
to calculate the Coulomb-interactions, and all
the non-bonded potentials were truncated with
a cutoff radius of 14 Å.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The geometrical structure of αS1-CM is
shown in Figure 1. The major parameters are
labeled including the dihedral angles of
structural backbone and sidechain. Besides, in
this paper, the two notable dihedral angles of
amide bond, Val2-Pro3 (ω2) and Phe4-Pro5 (ω4),
are also considered. It is generally accepted that
the most important pharmacophoric parameters
in the opioid peptides include the distance from
the protonated amine (N-terminal nitrogen
atom) to the Tyr aromatic ring (A), the distance
from the protonated amine to a second
hyrdophobic center (a second aromatic ring, B),
and the distance between the Tyr ring and
hyrdophobic center (A-B), and these symbols
are also displayed in Figure 1.
As a result of the structural feature of
αS1-CM is a linear pentapeptide that is
hampered by its intrinsic flexibility, hence it is
difficult to calculate the structural stability. On
