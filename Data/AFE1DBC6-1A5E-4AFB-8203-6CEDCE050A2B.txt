第二章 計畫英文摘要 
 
The diagnosability has played an important role in the reliability and fault-tolerance of an 
interconnection network. Since processors or links may fail sometimes, diagnosable 
properties are also concerned in many studies on network topologies. Under the classical 
PMC diagnosis model, only processors with direct connections are allowed to test one another. 
Given a system, if all the adjacent neighbors of a processor v are faulty simultaneously, it is 
not possible to determine whether processor v is fault-free or faulty. Hence, for most practical 
systems that are sparsely connected, only a small number of faulty processors can be 
recognized with the classical diagnosis model. So, it is an interesting problem to explore some 
measures for better reflecting fault patterns in a real system than the existing ones. For 
example, Das et al. investigated fault diagnosis with local constraints. The hypercube 
structure is a well-known interconnection model for multiprocessor systems. Fault-tolerant 
computing for the hypercube structure has been of interest to many researchers. We have 
introduced an attractive measure of conditional diagnosability by restricting that any faulty set 
cannot contain all the neighbors of any vertex in the graph (simply abbreviated as 
L-condition). Based on this requirement, the conditional diagnosability of the n-dimensional 
hypercube is shown to be 4(n − 2) + 1, which is about four times as large as the classical 
diagnosability. In this project, we will in advance investigate the other properties and propose 
an efficient diagnosis algorithm for hypercube with L-condition. Moreover, we also study the 
conditional diagnosability for other important networks in this project.

群,而E則代表節點間的連結，只要節點u和v相互連接，即表示有邊(u,v)存在。 
 
診斷過程中，所有收集到的測試結果(outcomes)被稱為系統的症狀(syndrome)。 假
設S是一個最多只有t個故障處理器的系統，如果每一次診斷中，都只有一種故障處理器
的分布會產生此種症狀，我們即稱此系統為t-可診斷(t-diagnosable)。 就一個t-可診斷的
系統S而言，自然也是(t-1)-可診斷、(t-2)-可診斷、…；而其中最大的t值，即稱此系統S
的錯誤診斷能力。 
 
錯誤診斷的特性問題即“對一系統在符合所要求的系統診斷能力下，找尋相關的必
要與充分條件＂。 如前所述，所謂t-可診斷系統即表示在故障節點不超過t個的情況下，
系統一定是唯一可診斷，即每一個症狀只唯一匹配一種故障處理器分布。 因此在測試
方法、系統節點數目n及系統診斷能力t間應有密切的關連，所以可在他們之間找到一些
特性關聯，並發展出相關的必要與充分條件。在許多研究文獻中均會針對其所採用之診
斷條件或觀念提出相關特性問題探討。令G(V,E)是系統S的圖形表示，F(⊆V)為V的一個
子集合；就一個收集的症狀σ而言，如果當F為故障節點集合且V-F為好的節點集合時，
若可產生同樣的症狀σ，則稱此集合F為症狀σ的一個相容錯誤集合(consistent fault 
set)，或稱F相容(consistent)於σ。 所謂診斷策略(diagnosis)問題，即是針對所給的症狀
σ，找出一個最少節點數的相容錯誤集合。 如果未對系統及症狀給于任何條件，則診
斷策略(diagnosis)問題為NP-complete。 然而，若所給系統已知為t-可診斷，則已有一些
有效率的演算法被提出[14,15,20-22,34,43,55]。 
 
在傳統PMC 診斷模型下，只是有直接相連的處理器被允許彼此測試。 試給一個系
統，如果一個處理器v的全部鄰居同時故障(faulty)，此情況下是不可能判斷處理器v是好
的還是故障。 因此，在大多數的實際系統為稀疏連結的情況下，傳統診斷模型只能適
用於僅少量故障處理器的情況，對於多一些處理器故障的情況即無法處理。 所以，探
討一些實際錯誤分布圖案或實用診斷方法以更能反映現實錯誤是一個有趣的研究方向。 
例如，Das 等人 [23]提出局部限制條件，並研究相關錯誤診斷問題。 
 
我們也提出一個條件式診斷能力(conditional diagnosability)的觀念[41]，並探討超級
立方體架構(hypercube)的條件式診斷能力及相關條件診斷特性。 在多處理器系統的錯
誤診斷能力的傳統測量上，一般假定處理器的任何子集都有可能同時故障；因此，一個
系統的錯誤診斷能力不可能超越它的最小維度(degree)。 但基於實際觀察，我們提出一
個合理限制條件，即“在網路裡的每個處理器v，所有直接連接v 的處理器不可同時故
障＂(簡稱L-條件)。 在L-條件下，我們推論出n維超級立方體架構的條件式診斷能力是
4(n-2)+ 1，此值大約是n維超級立方體架構的傳統診斷能力的4 倍。 
 
超級立方體架構 [49]是多處理器系統中一個著名且被廣泛研究應用的架構。 如何
去計算超級立方體架構的錯誤容忍能力也引起很多研究人員的興趣[9,36-38,40,41, 56]。 
維度n的超級立方體架構，以Qn 表示，是由2n頂點和n2n-1邊緣組成的一個無向圖。 超級
立方體架構Q1是由兩個頂點{0,1}組成的一張完全圖K2。 當n大於或等於2時，Qn是由兩
份Qn-1透過一組完美配對(perfect matching)連接形成。 每個Qn的頂點u可以二進制的n位
串列un-1un-2...u1u0清楚地標示。 如果兩個頂點的二進制串列正好只有一位元不同，即表
示此兩個頂點之間有邊相連。

An n-dimensional crossed cube, CQn[3], is a variation
of hypercube, which is derived from hypercube by chang-
ing the connection of some hypercube links. Though
some topological properties of crossed cubes have been
studied in the literature [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 15, 16]. In
this paper, we prove that the crossed cube is globally two-
equal-disjoint path coverable. In next section, we give
the definition of two-equal-disjoint path coverable prob-
lem and Crossed Cubes. Then we prove that the crossed
cube is globally two-equal-disjoint path coverable in the
section 3. In the final section, we give the conclusion.
2. Preliminary
In this section, we will first give the definition of glob-
ally two-equal-disjoint path coverable problem of a graph
G, and then we will give the relevant definitions in graph
theory and the definition of the Crossed cubes.
Definition 1 A graph G is (u, v, w, x)-two-equal-disjoint
path coverable if there are two disjoint paths P and Q
such that P joins the vertices u to v, Q joins the vertices
w to x, and V (P ∪Q) = V (G).
Definition 2 A graph G is globally two-equal-disjoint
path coverable if for any two distinct pairs of vertices
(u, v) and (w, x), the (u, v, w, x)-two-equal-disjoint path
cover exist.
To define the Crossed cubes, as proposed by Efe [3],
the notion so called ”pair related” relation is introduced.
Definition 3
Let R = {(00, 00), (10, 10), (01, 11), (11, 01)}. Two two-
digit binary strings u = u1u0 and v = v1v0 are pair
related if and only if (u, v) ∈ R.
The following is the recursive definition of the n-
dimensional Crossed cube CQn.
Definition 4 [3] The Crossed cube CQ1 is a complete
graph with two nodes labelled by 0 and 1, respectively.
For n ≥ 2, an n-dimensional Crossed cube CQn consists
of two (n − 1)-dimensional sub-Crossed cubes, CQ0n−1
and CQ1n−1, and a perfect matching between the nodes of
CQ0n−1 and CQ1n−1 according to the following rule:
Let V (CQ0n−1) = {0un−2un−3...u0 : ui = 0 or 1}
and V (CQ1n−1) = {1vn−2vn−3...v0 : vi = 0 or 1}. The
node u = 0un−2un−3...u0 ∈ V (CQ0n−1) and the node
v = 1vn−2vn−3...v0 ∈ V (CQ1n−1) are adjacent in CQn
if and only if
(1) un−2 = vn−2 if n is even, and
(2) (u2i+1u2i, v2i+1v2i) ∈ R, for 0 ≤ i < n−12 	.
If u and v are two adjacent vertices in CQn and j is
the leftmost differing bit, we say that v is the j-neighbor
of u. Moreover, u represents the (n − 1)-neighbor of u
in CQn. We then introduce a important fault Hamiltonian
result for proving the main theorem in the next section of
this paper. A graph G is k-fault Hamiltonian connected if
for any faulty set F ⊂ V (G) ∪ E(G) such that |F | ≤ k,
G− F is still Hamiltonian connected.
Lemma 1 [7] CQn is n−3 fault Hamiltonian connected.
3. Crossed cube is globally two-
disjoint equal path coverable
As a starting point we present the lemma below which
establishes the base case of Theorem 1.
Lemma 2 CQ3 and CQ4 are not globally two-equal-
disjoint path coverable.
Proof. To prove this lemma, we give a counter example
for each case. Given two pair of vertices 0, 1 and 2, 3,
there is no two-equal-disjoint path and cover all vertices
in CQ3. Given two pair of vertices 0, 3 and 4, 7, there is
no two-equal-disjoint path and cover all vertices in CQ4
also. 
Lemma 3 CQ5 is globally two-equal-disjoint path cov-
erable.
Proof. To prove this case is very tedious. With long and
detail discussion, we have completed theoretical proof for
CQ5. Nevertheless, we do not present it in this paper for
reducing complexity. However, we can also verify this
small case directly using computer. 
Next we formally show the main result that CQn, n ≥
5, is globally two-disjoint equal path coverable.
Theorem 1 Crossed cube, CQn, is globally two-equal-
disjoint path coverable for n ≥ 5.
Proof. We prove this theorem by induction on n. The base
case is CQ5. With Lemma 3, the base case holds. By
induction hypothesis, we can assume that CQn is glob-
ally two-equal-disjoint path coverable. Now, we need to
show that CQn+1 is also globally two-equal-disjoint path
coverable. Let (a, b) and (c, d) be two distinct source-
destination pairs of CQn+1. In the following, we estab-
lish two disjoint paths P,Q of length 2n − 1 with end
vertices (a, b) and (c, d), respectively. By the relative po-
sitions of the four vertices, we divide the proof into four
cases as follows.
Case 1: a, b, c and d are all in same CQn, say CQ0n, of
CQn+1.

to globally two-equal-disjoint path coverable. This work
may help to discuss the many-to-many disjoint path cov-
erable problem.

4 Conclusions
In this paper, we study the existence of cycles with
some requirements in CQn. For the given two ver-
tices u and v, the cycle is called a geodesic cycle if it
contains the shortest path between u and v. Clearly,
a geodesic cycle can minimize the transmission delay
from u to v. Herein, we prove that CQn is geodesic
4-pancyclic.
The question of embedding geodesic cycles in
other important networks, like the star graphs, Twisted
cubes and Mo¨bius cubes still remains open.

228 H.-C. Hsu et al. / Information Processing Letters 101 (2007) 227–232tions, we follow [1]. Let G be a graph if V (G) is a
finite set and E(G) is a subset of {(u, v) | (u, v) is an
unordered pair of V }. We say that V (G) is the vertex
set and E(G) is the edge set. Two vertices u and v are
adjacent if (u, v) ∈ E(G). A path is a sequence of ad-
jacent vertices, written as 〈v0, v1, v2, . . . , vm〉, in which
all the vertices v0, v1, . . . , vm are distinct except possi-
bly v0 = vm. We also write the path 〈v0,P , vm〉, where
P = 〈v0, v1, . . . , vm〉. The length of a path P , l(P ), is
the number of edges in P . We also use (v0, vm)i to rep-
resent the path joining v0 and vm with length i. Let u
and v be two vertices of G. Let the distance between u
and v, denoted by dG(u, v), be the length of the short-
est path of G joining u and v. The diameter of G is the
maximum distance between any pair of vertices of G.
The path embedding problems have attracted much
attention of research [8,11]. One of the most popular
path embedding problem is Hamiltonian path problem.
A path is a Hamiltonian path if its vertices are dis-
tinct and span V (G). A graph G is Hamiltonian con-
nected if there exists a Hamiltonian path joining any
two vertices of G. A graph G is k-fault Hamiltonian
connected if G−F remains Hamiltonian connected for
every F ⊂ V (G) ∪ E(G) with |F |  k. Another path
embedding problem deals with all the possible lengths
of the paths. A graph G is panconnected if each pair
of distinct vertices u,v are joined by a path of length l,
dG(u, v) l  |V (G)| − 1.
A cycle is a path with at least three vertices such that
the first vertex is the same as the last one. A ring struc-
ture is often used as a interconnection architecture for
local area network and as a control and data flow struc-
ture in distributed networks due to its good properties.
One of the most popular problem is Hamiltonian prob-
lem. A Hamiltonian cycle of G is a cycle that traverses
every vertex of G exactly once. A graph is Hamiltonian
if it has a Hamiltonian cycle. A Hamiltonian graph G is
k-fault Hamiltonian if G − F remains Hamiltonian for
every F ⊂ V (G) ∪ E(G) with |F |  k. Another ring
embedding problem, which deals with all the possible
lengths of the cycles, is investigated in a lot of inter-
connection networks [2,6,7,9–11]. In general, a graph is
pancyclic if it contains a cycle of every length from 3 to
|V (G)| inclusive.
There are a lot of interconnection network topolo-
gies proposed in literature. Among these topologies, the
n-dimensional hypercube, denoted by Qn, is a popular
one. Several variations of the hypercubes have been in-
vestigated to improve the efficiency of the hypercubes
[1,2]. The Augmented cube AQn, recently proposed by
Choudum and Sunitha [3], is one of such variations.
For any positive integer n, AQn is a vertex transitive,(2n− 1)-regular, and (2n− 1)-connected graph with 2n
vertices.
Recently, Chan et al. [2] proposed the geodesic pan-
cyclic embedding problem of a graph G. In this paper,
we consider the geodesic and balanced cycle embedding
problems in AQn. Herein, we will prove that AQn is geo-
desic pancyclic and balanced pancyclic for n  2. The
rest of this paper is organized as follows. In next section,
we study necessary definitions and discuss some useful
properties of the augmented cubes. Section 3 shows that
AQn is geodesic pancyclic. Section 4 proves that AQn is
also balanced pancyclic. Finally, we conclude this pa-
per.
2. Preliminaries
Let n  1 be an integer. The graph of the n-dimen-
sional Augmented cube [3], denoted by AQn, has 2n ver-
tices, each labeled by an n-bit binary string V (AQn) =
{un−1un−2 . . . u1u0 | ui ∈ {0,1} for all 0  i  n − 1}.
AQ1 is the complete graph K2 with vertex set {0,1}. For
n 2, AQn can be recursively constructed by two copies
of AQn−1, denoted by AQ0n and AQ1n, and by adding 2n
edges between AQ0n and AQ1n as follows:
Let V (AQ0n) = {0un−2un−3 . . . u0 | ui ∈ {0,1} for 0
i  n−2} and V (AQ1n) = {1vn−2vn−3 . . . v0 | vi ∈ {0,1}
for 0  i  n − 2}. A vertex u = 0un−2un−3 . . . u0 of
AQ0n is joined to a vertex v = 1vn−2vn−3 . . . v0 of AQ1n
if and only if either
(i) ui = vi , for 0  i  n − 2; in this case, (u,v) is
called a hypercube edge and we set v = uh, or
(ii) ui = 1 − vi , for 0 i  n− 2; in this case, (u,v) is
called a complement edge and we set v = uc.
The Augmented cubes AQ1,AQ2, and AQ3 are illus-
trated in Fig. 1. It is proved in [3] that AQn is a ver-
tex transitive, (2n− 1)-regular, and (2n− 1)-connected
graph with 2n vertices for any positive integer n.
Lemma 1. [3] The diameter of AQn is n/2	.
Lemma 2. [3] Suppose that two distinct vertices u and v
are both in AQbn with b ∈ {0,1}. Then dAQn(u, v) =
dAQbn(u, v).
Lemma 3. [3] Suppose that the vertex u in AQbn and the
vertex v in AQ1−bn with b ∈ {0,1}. Then there exist two
shortest paths P1 and P2 such that all vertices of P1 in
AQbn except v and all vertices of P2 in AQ1−bn except u
when d(u, v) 2 and n 3.

i1 i  2n−1 − 1. By the structure of AQn, there exists
a neighbor x of w such that (x, v) ∈ E(AQ1n). Since
AQ1n is panconnected, there exist (x, v)i paths with
1 i  2n−1 − 1 in AQ1n. Thus, we can find the geo-
desic cycle (b) gCl(u, v;AQn) for 2n−1 − 2  l  2n
with the form 〈u, (u,w)2n−1−1,w,x, (x, v)i, v, u〉 for
1 i  2n−1 − 1. Clearly, with (a) and (b) we can find
all geodesic cycles in this subcase.
Subcase 2.2. dAQn(u, v)  2. By Lemma 3, there
exist two disjoint shortest paths joining u and v with
the form 〈u,P1, v′, v〉 and 〈u,u′,P2, v〉 such that all
vertices of 〈u,P1, v′〉 are in AQ0n and all vertices of
〈u′,P2, v′〉 are in AQ1n. Clearly, gCl(u, v;AQn) with
l = 2d (u, v) exists. Then we consider the case of
Hence, max{2dAQ0n(u, v′),3} + 2  2dAQn(u, v) + 1 
l(C)  2n. Hence, C is a form of the geodesic cycles
gCl(u, v,AQn) for all 2dAQn(u, v) + 1  l  2n. This
completes the proof. 
4. Balanced pancyclicity of Augmented cubes
This section is devoted to illustrating the balanced
pancyclic property of augmented cubes. First, we in-
troduce the definitions of balanced cycle and balanced
pancyclic. Then, AQn for n  2 is showed to be bal-
anced pancyclic.

dAQn(u, v) = dAQ0n(u, v), l(C) = dAQn(u, v)+3+2n−1−
dAQn(u, v) − 2 = 2n−1 + 1. Thus, C is a geodesic cycle
gC2
n−1+1(u, v;AQn).
Subcase 1.2. 2n−1 + 2  l  2n. Base on the previ-
ous subcase, we have the geodesic cycle gC2n−1+1(u, v;
AQn) = 〈u,Ps, v,w,wh, vh, v,P ′c, u〉. Since AQ1n is
panconnected, there exist the (vh,wh)i paths with 1 
i  2n−1−1 in AQ1n. Let C = 〈u,Ps, v,w,wh, (wh, vh)i,
vh, v,P ′c, u〉. Since dAQn(u, v) = dAQ0n(u, v), l(C) =
dAQn(u, v) + 2 + i + 1 + 2n−1 − dAQn(u, v) − 2 =
2n−1 + 1 + i. Hence, we can find C with 2n−1 + 2 
l(C) 2n. Therefore, C is a format of the geodesic cy-
cles gCl(u, v;AQn) for 2n−1 + 2 l  2n.
Case 2. u ∈ V (AQbn) and v ∈ V (AQ1−bn ) with b ∈
{0,1}. Without loss of generality, assume that u ∈
V (AQ0n) and v ∈ V (AQ1n).
Subcase 2.1. dAQn(u, v) = 1. By Lemma 4, there
exists a path 〈u,w,v〉 such that w is a neighbor
of u in AQ0n. Since AQ0n is panconnected, there ex-
ist the paths (u,w)i with 1  i  2n−1 − 1 in AQ0n.
Thus, we can construct (a) gCl(u, v;AQn) for 3 

In this paper, we study the existence of cycles with

the shortest path between u and v. Clearly, a geodesic
cycle can minimize the transmission delay from u to v.

Abstract
Embedding of paths have attracted much attention in the parallel processing. Many-to-many com-
munication is one of the most central issues in various interconnection networks. A graph G is globally
two-equal-disjoint path coverable if for any two distinct pairs of vertices (u, v) and (w, x) of G, there exist
two disjoint paths P and Q satisfied that (1) P (Q respectively) joins u and v (w and x respectively),
(2) |P | = |Q|, and (3) V (P ∪ Q) = V (G). The Matching Composition Network (MCN) is a family of
networks which two components are connected by a perfect matching. In this paper, we consider the
globally two-equal-disjoint path cover property of MCN. Applying our result, the Crossed cube CQn,
the Twisted cube TQn, and the Mo¨bius cube MQn can all be proven to be globally two-equal-disjoint
path coverable for n ≥ 5.
Keywords: Interconnection networks; Matching Composition Networks; k disjoint path cover, two-equal-
disjoint path cover, Hamiltonian-connectivity.
1 Introduction
For the graph deﬁnition and notation, we follow [1]. G = (V,E) is a graph if V is a ﬁnite set and E is a subset
of {(u, v) | (u, v) is an unordered pair of V }. We say that V is the vertex set and E is the edge set. Two
vertices u and v are adjacent if (u, v) ∈ E. A path, denoted by 〈v0, v1, v2, . . . , vk〉, is a sequence of distinct
vertices where vi and vi+1 are adjacent for all i, 0 ≤ i ≤ k − 1. The length of a path P , |P |, is the number
of edges in P . We also write the path 〈v0, v1, v2, . . . , vk〉 as 〈v0, P1, vi, vi+1, . . . , vj , P2, vt, . . . , vk〉, where
P1 is the subpath 〈v0, v1, . . . , vi〉 and P2 is the subpath 〈vj , vj+1, . . . , vt〉. It is possible to write a path as
〈v0, v1, P, v1, v2, . . . , vk〉 if |P | is 0. Sometimes, a path can also be represented by 〈v0, v1, . . . , vi, e, vi+1, . . . , vn〉

CQn, the Twisted cube TQn, and the Mo¨bius cube MQn. Basically, MCN and these mentioned cubes are
all constructed from two graphs G0 and G1 with the same number of vertices, by adding a perfect matching
between the vertices of G0 and G1. We shall call these two graphs G0 and G1 as the components of MCN.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: The next section is preliminary. We give the formal
deﬁnitions of the two-equal-disjoint path cover property and the Matching Composition Network. In section
3, we discuss the main theorem. We then discuss the two-equal-disjoint path cover property of CQn, TQn,
and MQn in section 4. Finally, our conclusions are given in section 5.
2 Preliminary
In this section, we will ﬁrst give the deﬁnition of globally two-equal-disjoint path cover property of a graph G,
and then we will give the relevant deﬁnitions in graph theory and the deﬁnition of the Matching Composition
Networks.
Definition 1 A graph G is (u, v, w, x)-two-equal-disjoint path coverable if there are two disjoint paths P and
Q with end vertices u, v and w, x, respectively, such that |P | = |Q| and V (P )⋃V (Q) = V (G).
Definition 2 A graph G is globally two-equal-disjoint path coverable if for any two distinct pairs of vertices
(u, v) and (w, x), G is (u, v, w, x)-two-equal-disjoint path coverable.
For these two deﬁnitions, we have the following corollaries.
Corollary 1 If a graph G is globally two-equal-disjoint path coverable then G is also Hamiltonian.
Proof. Let P and Q be the (u, v, w, x)-two-equal-disjoint path cover of G such that P joins u to v and Q
joins w to x where (u, x), (v, w) ∈ E(G). Then 〈u, P, v, w,Q, x, u〉 is a Hamiltonian cycle of G. 
Corollary 2 If a graph G is globally two-equal-disjoint path coverable then G is also Hamiltonian connected.
Proof. Give any two arbitrary distinct vertices u and x of G. Let P and Q be the (u, v, w, x)-two-equal-
disjoint path cover ofG such that P joins u to v and Q joins w to x with (v, w) ∈ E(G). Then 〈u, P, v, w,Q, x〉
is a Hamiltonian path of G. 
Now, we deﬁne the Matching Composition Network (MCN) as follows: Let G0 and G1 be two graphs with
the same number of vertices. Let L be an arbitrary perfect matching between the vertices of G0 and G1, i.e.,
3
Case 1: a, b, c and d are all in the same component Gi, i = 0, 1.
Without loss of generality, let a, b, c and d are all in G0. By hypothesis, there are two disjoint paths
〈a, P0, b〉 and 〈c,Q0, d〉 in G0, where |P0| = |Q0| = N2 − 1. Let (w, x) and (y, z) be two edge on P0 and
Q0, respectively, and let P0 = 〈a, P 10 , w, x, P 20 , b〉 and Q0 = 〈c,Q10, y, z,Q20, d〉. By hypothesis again, we have
two disjoint paths 〈w,P1, x〉 and 〈y,Q1, z〉 of length N2 − 1 in G1. Let P = 〈a, P 10 , w, w, P1, x, x, P 20 , b〉 and
Q = 〈c,Q10, y, y,Q1, z, z,Q20, d〉. Clearly, P and Q are two disjoint paths and |P | = |Q| = N − 1. (See Fig. 2)

Figure 2: a, b, c and d are in G0.
Case 2: a, b and c are in the same component Gi, i = 0, 1; d is in another component G1−i.
Without loss of generality, let a, b, and c are in G0 and d is in G1. By the hypothesis N ≥ 8, we can let
w be a vertex in G0 and w /∈ {a, b, c, d}. By hypothesis, there are two disjoint paths 〈a, P0, b〉 and 〈c,Q0, w〉
with |P0| = |Q0| = N2 −1 in G0. Let x be the neighbor of b on the path P0 and let P0 = 〈a, P ′0, x, b〉. If x = d
and b = d, we can get two disjoint paths 〈x, P1, b〉 and 〈w,Q1, d〉 with |P1| = |Q1| = N2 − 1 in G1. (See Fig.
3) Let P = 〈a, P ′0, x, x, P1, b, b〉 and Q = 〈c,Q0, w, w,Q1, d〉. Clearly, P and Q are also two disjoint paths
with |P | = |Q| = N − 1. Otherwise, the conditions x = d or b = d exist. Note that N2 − 1 ≥ 3. Therefore, we
can choose a and the neighbor of a on the path P0 to replace b and x, respectively, and then rebuild another
two-equal-disjoint path cover by the similar technique.
Case 3: a and b are both in the same component Gi, i = 0, 1; c and d are both in another component G1−i.
Without loss of generality, let a and b be in G0; and let c and d be in G1. By hypothesis, there exists a
Hamiltonian path P (Q respectively) joining a (c respectively) and b (d respectively) in G0 (G1 respectively).
Clearly, P and Q are two disjoint paths with |P | = |Q| = N − 1.
Case 4: a and c are both in the same component Gi, i = 0, 1; b and d are both in another component G1−i.

two subcubes. The main diﬀerence is that each of these cubes has various perfect matching between its
subcubes. An n-dimensional cube has 2n vertices, connectivity n, diagnosability n [11], and each vertex has
the same degree n.
Hypercube is a well-known bipartite graph and there are no paths of odd length for any two end vertices
belong to the same partite set. Note that 2
n
2 − 1 is odd number. That is, Qn is not (u, v, w, x)-two-equal-
disjoint path coverable for some vertices u, v, w, x. Therefore, Qn is not globally two-equal-disjoint path
coverable. In the following, we brieﬂy state the recursive deﬁnitions of CQn, TQn, and MQn and prove they
are all globally two-equal-disjoint path coverable for n ≥ 5.
The vertices of these n-dimensional cubes are usually represented by the n-bit binary strings. A binary
string u of length n will be written as u = un−1un−2un−3 · · ·u0, where ui ∈ {0, 1}, 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. The
following is the recursive deﬁnition of the n-dimensional Crossed cube CQn.
Definition 3 [3] The Crossed cube CQ1 is a complete graph with two vertices labelled by 0 and 1, respectively.
For n ≥ 2, an n-dimensional Crossed cube CQn consists of two (n−1)-dimensional sub-Crossed cubes, CQ0n−1
and CQ1n−1, and a perfect matching between the vertices of CQ
0
n−1 and CQ
1
n−1 according to the following
rule:
Let V (CQ0n−1) = {0un−2un−3...u0 : ui = 0 or 1} and V (CQ1n−1) = {1vn−2vn−3...v0 : vi = 0 or 1}. The
vertex u = 0un−2un−3...u0 ∈ V (CQ0n−1) and the vertex v = 1vn−2vn−3...v0 ∈ V (CQ1n−1) are adjacent in
CQn if and only if
(1) un−2 = vn−2 if n is even, and
(2) (u2i+1u2i, v2i+1v2i) ∈ {(00, 00), (10, 10), (01, 11), (11, 01)}, for 0 ≤ i < 
n−12 .
Hilbers et al.[7] deﬁned the Twisted cubes using the parity function. Let u = un−1un−2 . . . u0, where
ui ∈ {0, 1} and 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, the parity function is deﬁned as Pi(u) = ui
⊕
ui−1
⊕ · · ·⊕u0, where
⊕
is
the exclusive-or operation.
Definition 4 [7] The Twisted cube TQ1 is a complete graph with two vertices, 0 and 1. Let n be an odd
integer and n ≥ 3. The vertices of an n-dimensional Twisted cube TQn are decomposed into four sets
S0,0, S0,1, S1,0 and S1,1. The set Si,j consists of those vertices u = un−1un−2 . . . u0 with un−1 = i and
un−2 = j, where (i, j) ∈ {(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)}. The induced subgraph of Si,j in TQn is isomorphic to

Proof. With long and detail discussion, we have completed theoretical proof for CQ5, TQ5, and MQ5.
Nevertheless, we do not present them in this paper for reducing complexity. However, we can also verify
these small cases directly using computer by translating the original proof into a program. 
By Theorem 1, we can prove that CQn, TQn and MQn are all globally two-equal-disjoint path coverable
for n ≥ 5. Then, we list the following three theorems.
Theorem 2 [12] The Crossed cube CQn is globally two-equal-disjoint path coverable for n ≥ 5.
Theorem 3 The Twisted cube TQn is globally two-equal-disjoint path coverable for n ≥ 5.
Theorem 4 The Mo¨bius cube MQn is globally two-equal-disjoint path coverable for n ≥ 5.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we discussed the two-equal-disjoint path cover property of the Matching Composition Networks
and propose a suﬃcient condition to verify if these networks are two-equal-disjoint path coverable. With the
condition, we prove that the Crossed Cube CQn, the Twisted cube TQn, and the Mo¨bius cube MQn are all
globally two-equal-disjoint path coverable for n ≥ 5. The globally two-equal-disjoint path cover problem is
an extension of Hamiltonian-connectivity problem. We can see Hamiltonian-connectivity problem as globally
one-path cover problem, and then we extended this property to globally two-equal-disjoint path coverable.
This work may help to discuss the many-to-many disjoint path cover problem.

2 Crossed Cubes
To deﬁne Crossed Cubes, we follow the Yang’s
deﬁnition [13]. First we need the following pair-
related mapping deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 1 Let n be a positive integer. Let
{0, 1}n denote the set of all binary strings with
0, 1 of length n. A pair-related mapping of order
n, denoted by PRn, is a bijective mapping from
{0, 1}n to {0, 1}n which is recursively deﬁned as
follows.
(1) For n = 1, PR1(0) = 0, PR1(1) = 1.
(2) For n = 2, PR2(00) = 00, PR2(10) = 10,
PR2(01) = 11, PR2(11) = 01.
(3) For odd n ≥ 3, PRn(un−1un−2 . . . u1u0) =
PR1(un−1)PRn−1(un−2un−3 . . . u1u0).
(4) For even n ≥ 4, PRn(un−1un−2 . . . u1u0) =
PR2(un−1un−2)PRn−2(un−3un−4 . . . u1u0).
The following is the deﬁnition of the n-
dimensional Crossed cube CQn.
Deﬁnition 2 Let n ≥ 2 be an integer. An
n-dimensional Crossed Cube, denoted by CQn,
is a graph with vertex set V (CQn) = {0, 1}
n.
Two vertices u = un−1un−2 . . . u1u0 and v =
vn−1vn−2 . . . v1v0 are adjacent if and only if there
is an index k such that
(1) ui = vi for each k + 1 ≤ i ≤ n− 1,
(2) uk = 1− vk,
(3) PRk(uk−1uk−2 . . . u1u0) = vk−1vk−2 . . . v1v0.
For convenience, we use (u)i to represent the i-
th neighbor of vertex u where the left-ﬁrst diﬀerent
bit between u and (u)i is i-th bit. That is, uj =
((u)i)j for j > i and ui = 1 − ((u)
i)i. For the
deﬁnition of the pair-related mapping and Crossed
Cubes, we have the following properties.
Property 1 PRk(PRk(uk−1uk−2 . . . u1u0)) =
uk−1uk−2 . . . u1u0
Property 2 Let Z = {00, 10}k, then PR2k(Z) =
Z.
3 The existence of the nearly short-
est path
Given any pair of double-bits, we get the set
U = {(00, 00), (00, 01), (00, 10), (00, 11), (01, 00),
(01, 01), (01, 10), (01, 11), (10, 00), (10, 01), (10, 10),
(10, 11), (11, 00), (11, 01), (11, 10), (11, 11)}.
Deﬁnition 3 Let EP = {(00, 00), (10, 10)}. Two
two-digit binary strings u = u1u0 and v = v1v0
are an equal pair if and only if (u, v) ∈ EP .
Deﬁnition 4 Let NEP = U/EP =
{(00, 01), (00, 10), (00, 11), (10, 00), (10, 01), (10, 11),
(01, 00), (01, 10), (01, 11), (01, 01), (11, 00), (11, 10),
(11, 01), (11, 11)}. Two two-digit binary strings
u = u1u0 and v = v1v0 are a non-equal pair if
and only if (u, v) ∈ NEP .
Let u = un−1un−2 . . . u2u1u0 and v =
vn−1vn−2 . . . v2v1v0 be two distinct vertices of
CQn. Let (u2k+1u2k, v2k+1v2k) be the right most
double-bits pair belongs to NEP where (n −
1)/2 ≥ k ≥ 0. Then we can partition u and v
into three parts, respectively, u = Xα2α1Z and
v = Y β2β1Z, where α2α1 = u2k+1u2k, β2β1 =
v2k+1v2k, |Z| = 2k, and |X| = |Y | = n− 2(k + 1)
for some (n − 1)/2 ≥ k ≥ 0. For example, let
u = 01100101010 and v = 11001111010 be two
vertices of CQ11 then Z = 1010, α2α1 = 10,
β2β1 = 11, X = 01100, and Y = 11001. Based
on the shortest path routing algorithm of K. Efe
[5, 6], suppose that dCQn−2(k+1)(X,Y ) = m ≥ 1,
we have the shortest path routing scheme listed in
Table 1.
Lemma 1 Suppose that u = Xα2α1Z and v =

Subcase 1.2: (α2α1, β2β1) ∈ {(01, 11), (11, 01)}.
Without loss of generality, we can assume that
(α2α1, β2β1) = (01, 11). Clearly, dCQn(u, v) =
dCQl(X,Y ) = m is odd in this case, and 2k + 2 ≤
j ≤ n − 1 for each edge (x, (x)j) of the short-
est path joining u and v. Suppose there exists
a path P joining u and v with the length equal
to dCQn(u, v) + 1 = m + 1. Hence, there ex-
ists at least one edge, say (w, (w)i), of P not
in a shortest path joining u and v. Therefore,
we can write P as 〈u, P1, w, (w)
i, P2, v〉. Clearly,
len(P1)+ len(P2) = m, and 2k+2 ≤ j ≤ n−1 for
each edge (y, (y)j) of the paths P1 and P2. Then
we divide the subcases by i.
Subcase 1.2.1: 0 ≤ i ≤ 2k − 1. By Lemma 4,
len(P ) ≥ dCQn(u, v) + 2. We get a contradiction.
Subcase 1.2.2: i = 2k or 2k + 1. Suppose that
len(P1) is even. Hence, w2k+1w2k = 01. Sup-
pose that i = 2k. Then (w)i2k+1(w)
i
2k = 00.
Clearly (w)i2k+1(w)
i
2k = v2k+1v2k = 00. We get
a contradiction. Suppose that i = 2k + 1. Then
(w)i2k+1(w)
i
2k = 11. Since len(P1) is even, len(P2)
is odd. Therefore, v2k+1v2k = 01. We get a con-
tradiction.
Suppose that len(P1) is odd. Hence,
w2k+1w2k = 11. Suppose that i = 2k. Then
(w)i2k+1(w)
i
2k = 10. Thus, v2k+1v2k = 10. We
get a contradiction. Suppose that i = 2k + 1.
Then (w)i2k+1(w)
i
2k = 01. Since len(P1) is odd,
len(P2) is even. Therefore, v2k+1v2k = 01. We
get a contradiction.
Subcase 1.2.3: 2k+2 ≤ i ≤ n. Clearly, len(P ) =
m+1 is even, and all the edges, say (y, (y)i), in P
are with 2k+2 ≤ i ≤ n−1. Hence, v2k+1v2k = 01.
We get a contradiction.
With these three subcases, it is easily to
know there is no such path P with len(P ) =
dCQn(u, v) + 1 in this case.
Case 2: dCQl(X,Y ) ≥ 2 is even. Let m =
dCQl(X,Y ).
Subcase 2.1: (α2α1, β2β1) ∈ {(00, 01),
(00, 10), (00, 11), (01, 00), (01, 10), (01, 11),
(10, 00), (10, 01), (10, 11), (11, 00), (11, 01),
(11, 10)}. Without loss of general-
ity, we can assume that (α2α1, β2β1) ∈
{(00, 01), (00, 10), (00, 11), (01, 10), (01, 11), (10, 11)}.
In this case, we try to add one more step in the
routing from X to Y . If it works, then we can
construct the path of length dCQn(u, v) + 1 in
Table 3.
Clearly, these paths are all of length
dCQn(u, v) + 1.
Subcase 2.2: (α2α1, β2β1) ∈ {(01, 01), (11, 11)}.
Without loss of generality, we can assume that
(α2α1, β2β1) = (01, 01). Clearly, dCQn(u, v) =
dCQl(X,Y ) = m is even in this case, and all
the edges, say (x, (x)j), of the shortest path are
with n ≥ j ≥ 2k + 2. Suppose there exists
a path P joining u and v with length equal to
dCQn(u, v) + 1 = m + 1. Hence, there exists at
least one edge, say (w, (w)i), of P not in a short-
est path joining u and v. Without loss of gen-
erality, we can write P as 〈u, P1, w, (w)
i, P2, v〉.
Clearly, len(P1) + len(P2) = m, and each edge,
say (y, (y)j), of P1 or P2 is with 2k ≤ j ≤ n − 1.
Then we divide the subcases by i.
Subcase 2.2.1: 0 ≤ i ≤ 2k − 1. By Lemma 4,
len(P ) ≥ dCQn(u, v) + 2. We get a contradiction.
Subcase 2.2.2: i = 2k or 2k + 1. Suppose that
len(P1) is even. Hence, w2k+1w2k = 01. Suppose
that i = 2k. Then (w)i2k+1(w)
i
2k = 00. Thus,
v2k+1v2k = 00. We get a contradiction. Sup-
pose that i = 2k + 1. Then (w)i2k+1(w)
i
2k = 11.
Since len(P1) is even, len(P2) is even. Therefore,
v2k+1v2k = 11. We get a contradiction.
Suppose that len(P1) is odd. Hence,
w2k+1w2k = 11. Suppose that i = 2k. Then

pieces of this packet arrived. Therefore, this kind
of transmission delay between u and v in a cycle is
determined by the longest path between u and v
in this cycle. It is of interest to ﬁnd a cycle passing
through u and v such that lengths of two disjoint
paths between u and v in this cycle are as equal
as possible.
Deﬁnition 1 Let G be a graph. For any two ver-
tices u, v ∈ V (G), a cycle C is called a balanced
cycle between u and v if dC(u, v) = max{dC(x, y) |
x, y ∈ V (C)}.
Consequently, if C is a balanced k-cycle be-
tween u and v, dC(u, v) = k2 	. In a bipartite
graph, there are only even cycles and vertex set
is divided into two partite sets. Hence we modify
deﬁnition 1 for bipartite graphs.
Deﬁnition 2 Let G = (B ∪ W,E) be a bipartite
graph. For any two vertices u and v in G, a cycle
C is called a balanced cycle between u and v if
dC(u, v) = max{dC(x, y) | x and u are in the same
partite set, and y and v are in the same partite set.

A bipartite graph is vertex-bipancyclic [3] if ev-
ery vertex lies on a cycle of every even length from
4 to |V (G)| inclusive. Similarly, a bipartite graph
is edge-bipancyclic if every edge lies on a cycle
of every even length from 4 to |V (G)| inclusive.
Obviously, every edge-bipancyclic graph is vertex-
bipancyclic. A bipartite graph G is balanced bi-
pancyclic if for each pair of vertices u, v ∈ V (G),
it contains a balanced cycle of every even length
of k satisfying max{2dG(u, v), 4} ≤ k ≤ |V (G)|
between u and v.

Figure 2: Qn for n = 2, 3.
Let u = un−1un−2 . . . u1u0 be an n-bit binary
strings. The Hamming weight of u, denoted by
w(u), is the number of ui such that ui = 1. Let
u = un−1un−2 . . . u1u0 and v = vn−1vn−2 . . . v1v0
be two distinct n-bit binary strings. The Ham-
ming distance h(u, v) between two vertices u and
v is the number of diﬀerent bits in the correspond-
ing strings of both vertices. The n-dimensional
hypercube, denoted by Qn, consists of all n-bit bi-
nary strings as its vertices and two vertices u and
v are adjacent if and only if h(u, v) = 1. Thus,
Qn is a bipartite graph with bipartition {u | w(u)
is odd} and {u | w(u) is even}. Figure 2 shows
Qn for n = 2 and n = 3. It is observed that
h(u, v) is odd if and only if u and v are in diﬀerent
partite sets. For 0 ≤ k < n, we use uk to de-
note the binary string vn−1vn−2 . . . v1v0 such that
vk = 1 − uk and ui = vi if i 
= k. An edge (u, v)
in E(Qn) is of dimension i if u = vi. It is known
that dQn(u, v) = h(u, v). The following lemmas
are useful in our later proofs.
Lemma 1 [2] Let u and v be two arbitrary dis-
tinct vertices with the same partite set in Qn for
n ≥ 2. Then, for any vertex w such that h(w, u)
is odd, there exists a path joining u and v passing
all vertices of Qn except w.
Lemma 2 [2] Let u and v be two arbitrary dis-
tinct vertices in Qn and h(u, v) = d, where n ≥ 2.
There are paths formed by 〈u, P [u, v], v〉 in the Qn
with lengths d,d + 2,d + 4, . . . , c, where c = 2n − 1
if d is odd, and c = 2n − 2 if d is even.
2 Qn is balanced bipancyclic
In this section, for any two vertices u and v in
Qn, we will discuss the cycle passing u and v with

Since d is odd, l(C)2 is odd, and dC(u, v) =
l(C)
2 ,
the cycle C is balanced (2k + 4)-cycle between u
and v where k = 1, 3, 5, . . ., 2n−1 − 3.
Case 2: d ≥ 2, i.e. u and v are not adjacent.
We prove this case by induction on n. Obvi-
ously, the proof of case 2 holds for n = 2. As-
sume that the proof of case 2 is true for every
integer 2 ≤ m < n. Let u = un−1un−2 . . . u1u0
and v = vn−1vn−2 . . . v1v0 be any two distinct
vertices of Qn and h(u, v) = d. Partitioning Qn
along dimension 0, Qn can be divided into two
(n − 1)-subcubes where Q0n−1 denotes the sub-
graph of Qn induced by {x ∈ V (Qn) | x0 = 0}
and Q1n−1 denotes the subgraph of Qn induced by
{x ∈ V (Qn) | x0 = 1}.
Subcase 2-1: u, v ∈ Q0n−1 or u, v ∈ Q1n−1.
(See Figure 4 and Figure 5.)
Without loss of generality, we may assume that
u, v ∈ Q0n−1. For the basis of this proof, we con-
sider Q3. It is clear that Q3 is balanced bipan-
cyclic (See Figure 4 for an illustration).

〈u, x, P1[x, v], v, y, P2[y, u], u〉 is balanced m-cycle
between u and v of Q0n−1 where m ≥ 6.
Suppose that n ≥ 4. By induction hypothesis,
Q0n−1 is balanced bipancyclic. Every balanced 2l-
cycle between u and v in Qn can be found in Q
0
n−1
where d ≤ l ≤ 2n−2. Let C be a balanced m-cycle
with m ≥ 6 between u and v in Q0n−1. Hence we
rewrite the cycle C as 〈u, x, P1[x, v], v, y, P2[y, u],
u〉. Let (u, u0), (x, x0), (v, v0), and (y, y0) be four
edges of dimension 0. It is observed that u0, x0,
v0, and y0 are four distinct vertices in Q1n−1, and
that (u0, x0) and (v0, y0) are two disjoint edges in
Q1n−1. Applying Lemma 4, there exist two disjoint
paths S1[u
0, x0] and S2[v
0, y0] in Q1n−1 such that
l(S1) = l(S2) = k where k = 1, 3, 5, 7, . . . , 2

0, x0], x0, x, P1[x, v], v, v
0, S2[v
0, y0], y0,

l(C′) = m + 2k + 2.

(a). Suppose that d is odd. Since C is a
balanced (2n−1 − 2)-cycle between u and v, and
l(C)
2 = 2
n−2 − 1 is odd, dC(u, v) = 2n−2 − 1. It is

(b). Suppose that d is even. Since C is a bal-
anced (2n−1−2)-cycle between u and v, and l(C)2 =

(a). Suppose that d is odd. Since C is a bal-

that dC′(u, v) = dC(u, v) + k + 1 = 2

(b). Suppose that d is even. Since C is a bal-

dC′(u, v) = dC(u, v) + k + 1 = 2
n−2 + k + 1 and
l(C′)
2 = 2

2 is even,
and dC′(u, v) = 2

Subcase 2-2: u ∈ Q0n−1 and v ∈ Q1n−1 (or
v ∈ Q0n−1 and u ∈ Q1n−1).
Without loss of generality, we may assume that
u ∈ Q0n−1 and v ∈ Q1n−1. Let (u, u0) and (v, v0)

Subcase 2-2-1: d is even, i.e. u and v are

w ∈ V (Q1n−1) and h(w, v) = 1. It is observed
that h(w, u0) is odd. By Lemma 1, there ex-
ists a path P [v, u0] of length 2n−1 − 2 joining v
and u0 passing all vertices of Q1n−1 except w. Let
(w,w0) be an edge of dimension 0. Hence w0 is
in Q0n−1, and w
0 and u are in diﬀerent partite
sets. By Lemma 2, there exists a hamiltonian path
P1[u,w
0] joining u and w0 in Q0n−1. Therefore,
longest cycle C between u and v in Qn can be con-
structed as 〈u, P1[u,w0], w0, w, v, P2[v, u0], u0, u〉.
Therefore, the cycle C passing through u and v,
l(C) = 2n−1 − 1 + 1 + 1 + 2n−1 − 2 + 1 = 2n, and
dC(u, v) = 2
n−1 − 1 = l(C)2 − 1. Since d is odd,
l(C)
2 is even, and dC(u, v) =
l(C)
2 − 1, the cycle C
is balanced cycle between u and v. The theorem
is proved. 

Dear Authors, 
 
We are writing you to inform you that ISPAN'07 will not be held any more. Sorry for not writing 
earlier, we were still hoping to host ISPAN in 2007 in Sydney but had to give up after a sequence of 
unfortunate events. 
 
ISPAN will be held in Sydney in 2008 during the period May 7-9. 
 
Our apologies, again. We hope to see you in Sydney in 2008. The new CFP will go out next week 
and the web page will be updated with the information shortly. 
 
Many thanks. 
 
regards,

geodesic 4-pancyclic. Finally, we present our conclu-
sions and implications.
2 Preliminaries
In this section, we will give the relevant definitions in
graph theory and for the Crossed cubes. To define the
Crossed cubes, as proposed by Efe [6], the notion of
so called ”pair related” relation is introduced.
Definition 1 [6] Let R =
{(00, 00), (10, 10), (01, 11), (11, 01)}. Two two-
digit binary strings u = u1u0 and v = v1v0 are pair
related, denoted as u ∼ v, if and only if (u, v) ∈ R.
The following is the recursive definition of the n-
dimensional Crossed cube CQn.
Definition 2 [6] The Crossed cube CQ1 is a com-
plete graph with two nodes labelled by 0 and 1, re-
spectively. For n ≥ 2, an n-dimensional Crossed cube
CQn consists of two (n−1)-dimensional sub-Crossed
cubes, CQ0n−1 and CQ1n−1, and a perfect matching
between the nodes of CQ0n−1 and CQ1n−1 according
to the following rule:
Let V (CQ0n−1) = {0un−2un−3...u0 : ui = 0
or 1} and V (CQ1n−1) = {1vn−2vn−3...v0 : vi = 0
or 1}. The node u = 0un−2un−3...u0 ∈ V (CQ0n−1)
and the node v = 1vn−2vn−3...v0 ∈ V (CQ1n−1) are
adjacent in CQn if and only if
(1) un−2 = vn−2 if n is even, and
(2) (u2i+1u2i, v2i+1v2i) ∈ R, for 0 ≤ i < ⌊n−12 ⌋.

A vertex v is the k-dimensional neighbor (ab-
breviate as k-neighbor) of u, denoted by v = uk,
if the left-first different bit of them is k. For a bi-
nary bit ui, ui ∈ {0, 1}, the complement of ui is de-
noted by ui = 1 − ui. For convenience, let u(i,j) =
uiui−1 . . . uj+1uj , i > j ≥ 0, and let symbol bi al-
ways belong {0, 1} throughout this paper.
Let x be an l-bit binary string with l ≤ n. We use
CQxn−l to denote the subgraph of CQn induced by the
set of vertices with the prefix x. It is shown in [10] that
CQxn−l is isomorphic to CQn−l. Moreover, for two
l-bit binary strings x and y, let CQ{x,y}n−l denote the
subgraph of CQn induced by CQxn−l
⋃
CQ
y
n−l. It is
proven in [7] that CQ{x,y}n−l is isomorphic to CQn−l+1
if CQxn−l and CQ
y
n−l are adjacent subgraphs of CQn.
Next, Lemmas 1 ∼ 3 are useful for verifying the
following other results in this paper.
Lemma 1 [13] Let u and v be two vertices of
CQb1n−1, where n ≥ 3. Then dCQn(u, v) =
d
CQ
b1
n−1
(u, v).
Lemma 2 [6] The diameter of Crossed cube, CQn,
is ⌈n+12 ⌉.
Lemma 3 [13] Let u and v be two vertices of CQn,
n ≥ 3. Then for every integer i, dCQn(u, v) + 2 ≤
i ≤ 2n − 1, the path (u, v)i exists.
In [4], two reducing strategies of CQn were pro-
posed depending on whether n is odd or even. For
n = 2k, we can can contract those vertices in CQ2k
having the same prefix of length two into a vertex
and obtain a graph with four vertices. And, this four-
vertex graph is isomorphic to CQ2, as shown in Fig.
2.(a). Similarly, for n = 2k+1, we can contract those
vertices in CQ2k+1 with the same prefix of length
three into a vertex and obtain a graph eight vertices.
Again, this eight-vertex graph is isomorphic to CQ3,
as shown in Fig. 2.(b). Moreover, for any two vertices
u, v in CQn, there are some observations on their rel-
ative position as the following lemma.

Lemma 4 [4] For all n ≥ 2, u and v are two vertices
of CQn, then they satisfy either one of the following
three conditions:

i ≤ 2n−1 − 1. Thus, we can construct a cycle
C as 〈u, Ps, v, v
n−1,(vn−1, xn−1)i, x
n−1, x, P ′c, u〉.
By Lemma 1, dCQn(u, v) = dCQ0
n−1
(u, v). Then
len(P ′c) = l0−dCQ0
n−1
(u, v)−1 = l0−dCQn(u, v)−
1. Hence, len(C) = dCQn(u, v) + 1 + i + 1 + (l0 −
dCQn(u, v) − 1) = 1 + i + l0.
Note that 2dCQ0
n−1
(u, v) + k ≤ l0 ≤ 2
n−1 and
⌈n2 ⌉, ⌈
n
2 ⌉+ 2 ≤ i ≤ 2
n−1 − 1. Suppose that i = ⌈n2 ⌉.
Then 2dCQn(u, v)+k+1+⌈n2 ⌉ ≤ len(C) ≤ 2
n−1 +
1 + ⌈n2 ⌉. On the other hand, 2dCQ0n−1(u, v) + k +
⌈n2 ⌉ + 3 ≤ len(C) ≤ 2
n if ⌈n2 ⌉ + 2 ≤ i ≤ 2
n−1 − 1.
By condition (a), 2dCQ0
n−1
(u, v) + k + ⌈n2 ⌉ + 3 ≤
2n−1+1+⌈n2 ⌉. Hence, we can get 2dCQn(u, v)+k+
1 + ⌈n2 ⌉ ≤ len(C) ≤ 2
n by adjusting the values of l0
and i. As a result, the geodesic cycles gC l(u, v; CQn)
for all 2dCQn(u, v) + k + 1 + ⌈n2 ⌉ ≤ l ≤ 2
n can be
constructed by format C. The proof is complete. ♦
Lemma 10 Let u ∈ V (CQb1n−1), v ∈ V (CQ
b1
n−1)
and u 6= vn−1. There exist the geodesic cycles
gC l(u, v; CQn) for all 2dCQn(u, v)+ k− 1 + ⌈n2 ⌉ ≤
l ≤ 2n if the following three conditions are satisfied.
(a) dCQn(u, v) = dCQb1
n−1
(u, vn−1) + 1,
(b) 2d
CQ
b1
n−1
(u, vn−1) + k + 2 ≤ 2n−1, and
(c) there exist the geodesic cy-
cles gC l0(u, vn−1; CQb1n−1) for all
2d
CQ
b1
n−1
(u, vn−1) + k ≤ l0 ≤ 2
n−1
.
Proof: Without loss of generality, assume
u, vn−1 ∈ V (CQ0n−1). By condition (c), there
exist the geodesic cycles gC l0(u, vn−1; CQ0n−1) for
all 2dCQ0
n−1
(u, vn−1) + k ≤ l0 ≤ 2
n−1
. Let
〈u, Ps, v
n−1〉 and 〈u, P ′c, x, vn−1〉 be the s-path and
the c-path of gC l0(u, vn−1; CQ0n−1), respectively.
By Lemma 2, dCQ1
n−1
(v, xn−1) ≤ ⌈n2 ⌉. By
Lemma 3, there exist the paths (v, xn−1)i for all
⌈n2 ⌉, ⌈
n
2 ⌉ + 2 ≤ i ≤ 2
n−1 − 1. Thus, we can
construct a cycle C as 〈u, Ps, vn−1, v, (v, xn−1)i,
xn−1, x, P ′c, u〉. By condition (a), dCQn(u, v) =
dCQ0
n−1
(u, vn−1) + 1 = len(Ps) + 1 and len(P ′c) =
l0 − dCQ0
n−1
(u, vn−1)− 1 = l0 − dCQn(u, v). Hence,
len(C) = dCQ0
n−1
(u, vn−1) + 1 + i + 1 + len(P ′c) =
(dCQn(u, v)− 1) + 1 + i + 1 + (l0 − dCQn(u, v)) =
i + l0 + 1.
Note that 2dCQ0
n−1
(u, vn−1) + k ≤ l0 ≤ 2
n−1
and ⌈n2 ⌉, ⌈
n
2 ⌉ + 2 ≤ i ≤ 2
n−1 − 1. Suppose that
i = ⌈n2 ⌉. Then 2dCQ0n−1(u, v
n−1) + k + 1 + ⌈n2 ⌉ ≤
len(C) ≤ 2n−1 + 1 + ⌈n2 ⌉. On the other hand,
2dCQ0
n−1
(u, vn−1) + k + ⌈n2 ⌉ + 3 ≤ len(C) ≤ 2
n
if ⌈n2 ⌉ + 2 ≤ i ≤ 2
n−1 − 1. By condition (b),
2dCQ0
n−1
(u, vn−1) + k + ⌈n2 ⌉+ 3 ≤ 2
n−1 + 1 + ⌈n2 ⌉.
That is, we can get 2dCQ0
n−1
(u, vn−1)+k+1+⌈n2 ⌉ ≤
len(C) ≤ 2n by adjusting the values of l0 and i.
Note that dCQ0
n−1
(u, vn−1) = dCQn(u, v)− 1. So the
geodesic cycles gC l(u, v; CQn) for all 2dCQn(u, v)+
k− 1 + ⌈n2 ⌉ ≤ l ≤ 2
n can be constructed with format
C. The proof is complete. ♦
Then, CQ4 is demonstrated to be 2-geodesic pan-
cyclic.
Lemma 11 CQ4 is geodesic 2-pancyclic.
Proof: To prove this case is very tedious. With long
and detail discussion, we have completed theoretical
proof for CQ4. Nevertheless, we do not present it in
this paper for reducing complexity. However, we can
also verify this small case directly using computer. ♦
We are now ready to show the geodesic pan-
cyclicity of crossed cubes for n ≥ 3 as follows.
Theorem 1 CQn is 4-geodesic pancyclic for n ≥ 3.
Proof: We show this theorem by induction on n. By
Lemmas 8 and 11, the theorem holds for n = 3, 4.
Assume that the theorem is true for every integer
5 ≤ m < n. Let u and v be two vertices in CQn.
According to their relative position with Lemma 4,
we can divide this proof into three cases: (1)both u
and v belong to the same subgraph CQn−1 of CQn,
(2)u ∈ V (CQb2b1n−2) and v ∈ V (CQb2b1n−2) if n is even,
and (3)u ∈ V (CQb3b2b1n−3 ) and either v ∈ V (CQb3b2b1n−3 )
or v ∈ V (CQb3b2b1n−3 ) if n is odd. In addition, let k = 4
throughout the proof.
Case 1: Both u and v belong to the same subgraph
CQn−1 of CQn.
Without loss of generality, assume u, v ∈
CQ0n−1. By Lemma 2, 2dCQ0
n−1
(u, v)+(k = 4)+2 ≤
2⌈n2 ⌉ + 6 ≤ 2
n−1 for n ≥ 5. By induction hypothe-
sis, there exist the geodesic cycles gC l0(u, v; CQ0n−1)
for all 2dCQ0
n−1
(u, v) + (k = 4) ≤ l0 ≤ 2
n−1
.
Since conditions (a) and (b) of Lemma 9 both hold,
there exist the geodesic cycles gC l1(u, v; CQn) for
all 2dCQn(u, v) + (k = 4) + 1 + ⌈n2 ⌉ ≤ l1 ≤
2n. By Lemma 1, dCQ0
n−1
(u, v) = dCQn(u, v). By
