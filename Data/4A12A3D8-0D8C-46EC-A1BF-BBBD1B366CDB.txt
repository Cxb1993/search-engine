Considering longitudinal and transverse both patterns roughness and several
parameters of micropolar fluids, we obtain the results scribing the system characteristics,
such as the film pressure, the loading-carrying capacity, and the time-height relationship.
The results in analysis conform to physical meanings and have same trend with other
concerning researches. Results obtained from the present project would provide useful
information for industrial engineering in designing fluid-film bearing systems.
1. Introduction
In general, the use of non-Newtonian complex lubricants improves the lubrication
characteristics of squeeze film bearings. Taking into account the intrinsic motion of the
material constituents of these complex fluids, a non-Newtonian theory of micropolar
fluids has been developed by Eringen (1964, 1966). Many researches pertaining to the
lubricating problems have presented applications of this micropolar fluid model to
engineering sciences. The following studies concerning the performance characteristics
are found in the fluid film journal bearings by Khonsari and Brewe (1989); the steady
slider bearings by Allen and Kline (1971); the steady hydrostatic bearings by Agrawal et
al.(1980); the squeeze-film rectangular plates by Balaram (1975); the squeeze-film
circular plates and infinitely long rectangular plates by Parkash and Sinha[22]; and the
squeeze-film hemispherical bearings by Sinha and Singh(1982). However, studies of the
squeeze-film sphere-plate system lubricated with non-Newtonian micropolar fluids are
absent.
Christensen (1970) transformed film pressure of bearings into mean film pressure
on using expected value operation to the Reynolds equation in the presence of rough
surfaces. The results show that surface roughness may considerably influence bearing
characteristics depending upon the structure of roughness patterns: longitudinal and
transverse both patterns. By applying the Christensen stochastic model, several
researches have investigated the influences of rough surfaces upon squeeze-film
characteristics; such as parallel squeeze rectangular plates by Lin (2001)] and Prakash
and Tiwari (1982)；circular plates by Prakash, J. and Tonder (1977) ; annular disk by

4. Results and Discussion
On the ground of the theory of micropolar fluids by Eringen (1964, 1966), the
effects of non-Newtonian rheology on the squeeze film characteristics are investigated
through two dimensionless parameters: the dimensionless coupling number N and the
dimensionless gap-fluid interacting parameter L. First, the coupling number N
characterizes the coupling relationship of the linear and angular momentum equations
resulting from the microrotation of the lubricant additives or the fluid molecules.
Therefore, the value of N describes the coupling between the rotational viscosity and the
Newtonian viscosity; As the value of 0N (i.e., 0 ), the expressions of micropolar
squeeze film characteristics derived in the previous section reduce to the traditional
continuum theory of Newtonian fluids. Second, the gap-fluid interacting
parameter lhL m /0 with  1/24/ l dominates the interaction between the film gap
and the micropolar fluid. A small size of additive molecules (or a small characteristic
material length) corresponds to a larger value of L; moreover, as the value of L
approaches infinite, the effects of microstructure become negligible; the non-Newtonian
micropolar-fluid Reynolds-type equation for the squeeze-film system reduces to the
traditional Newtonian form. The values of the micropolar-fluid viscosity coefficients can
be calculated by the experimental study proposed by Kolpashchikou et al. (1983).
0/ mhc under 8.0N and 1L . Longitudinal and transverse both patterns roughness
have different effect for squeeze-film characteristics, longitudinal pattern makes
load-carrying capacity *W decrease, and transverse pattern makes it increase, and the
effect of transverse pattern roughness is more obvious than longitudinal pattern. And
these effects appear in smaller film thickness especially.
5. Conclusions
Based on the results obtained and discussed, conclusions are drawn as follows.
The higher concentration of additive molecules N and values of the lower interacting
parameter L both are observed to increase the load capacity. The longitudinal pattern
roughness makes load-carrying capacity *W decrease, and transverse pattern roughness
makes it increase. Of course, we can get the results that the time-height relationship has
also similar influence in micropolar effect and in surface-roughness effect.
