 ABSTRACT 
Molecular dynamics simulations of the biphalin molecule, (Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-Phe-NH)2, and the active 
tetrapeptide hydrazide, Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-Phe-NH-NH2, were performed to investigate the cause of the 
increased μ and δ receptor binding affinities of the former over the latter. The simulation results 
demonstrate that the acylation of the two equal tetrapeptide fragments of biphalin produces the 
constrained hydrazide bridges C4α-C4′-N9-N10 and N9-N10-C5′-C5α, which in turn increase the 
opportunity of conformations for binding to μ or δ receptors. Meanwhile, the connection of the two 
active tetrapeptide fragments of biphalin also results in the constrained side chain torsion angle χ2 at 
one of the two residues Phe. This constrained side chain torsion angle not only significantly increases 
the δ receptor binding affinity but also makes most of the δ receptor binding conformations of biphalin 
bind to the δ receptor through the fragment containing the mentioned residue Phe.  
Keywords: biphalin, tetrapeptide hydrazide
 message sequence, which is composed of two pharmacophoric amino acid residues, Tyr and Phe, joined 
by two spacer residues, D-Ala and Gly. The amine and phenolic groups of Tyr and the aromatic group 
of Phe are required for opioid receptor recognition. Yamazaki et al. [14] have explained the biological 
activities of the vast majority of the μ-selective morphiceptin analogs using a pharmacophore model 
established by them. This model proposed that the characteristic distances with the three 
pharmacophore groups, d1 (Tyr N-Tyr OH), d2 (Tyr N-the center of the aromatic ring of residue Phe), 
and d3 (Tyr OH-the center of the aromatic ring of residue Phe) are ~8, ~7, and ~11-13 Å, respectively. 
The model also requires the side chains in a trans-rotamer  (χ1=180°) for the Tyr and Phe residues. 
Shenderovich et al. [15], by performing a comparative molecular modeling study of δ-opioid ligands, 
presented a three dimensional model of pharmacophore groups on binding to the δ-receptor. The 
pharmacophore model for δ-opioid agonists proposes a characteristic distance of 7.0±1.3Å between the 
two aromatic rings and of 8.2±1.0Å between the nitrogen and phenyl ring. This model requires the 
conformer with a trans-rotamer of Tyr and a gauche(-)-rotamer (χ1=–60°) of Phe. According to these 
pharmacophore models, the combination of the two active fragments of the enkephalin analog in 
biphalin will lead to more probabilities in binding to both the μ and δ receptors, as compared to the 
single tetrapeptide of the enkephalin analog. 
For a better understanding of the protein function of biphalin on the atomic level, this work 
performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of biphalin molecule (Fig. 1(a)) and one single 
fragment of enkephalin analog, the tetrapeptide hydrazide Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-Phe-NH-NH2 (Fig. 1(b)), in 
aqueous solution, respectively. The biological activities of biphalin and the tetrapeptide hydrazide were 
compared based on the pharmacophore models mentioned above. This work focused on the forming 
probabilities of the characteristic distance between Tyr OH and the center of the aromatic ring of 
residue Phe that is required for binding to the μ receptor and the characteristic distance between the 
centers of the rings residues of Tyr and Phe that is required for binding to the δ receptor. The cause of 
the increased μ and δ receptor binding affinities of biphalin over the tetrapeptide hydrazide will then be 
investigated. The simulation results will demonstrate how the acylation of the two equal tetrapeptide 
 2. Method 
The MD simulations performed in this study were carried out using the GROMACS version 3.3.3 
simulation program with the GROMOS96 (ffG43a1) force field [16, 17]. Biphalin molecule and the 
bioactive tetrapeptide hydrazide were simulated to be surrounded by a total of 4,539 water molecules, 
respectively. The initial structure of each peptide was prepared according to the one constructed using 
the X-ray crystal analysis of biphalin [18]. The whole system of the aqueous solution was contained 
within a cubic box with a side of ca. 52 Å and periodic boundary conditions, so the average density of 
the solution was kept at ca. 1 g/cm3. The MD simulations were begun assuming random velocity of the 
atoms that followed a Maxwellian distribution at 300 K. The atom positions and velocities were 
integrated according to the standard Verlet algorithm. The integration time step was chosen as Δt=2 fs. 
The system was first equilibrated at 300 K and the constant pressure relevant to the density of 1 g/cm3, 
using the Berendsen algorithm [19]. After the equilibrium was achieved, the time evolutions of all 
quantities considered in this study were recorded per 2 ps, and the MD simulations were continued for a 
simulating time domain of 50 ns. In the MD simulations, long-range Coulomb interactions were 
calculated using the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method. All the non-bonded potentials were truncated 
with a cutoff radius of 14 Å, which is appropriate in avoiding severe artifacts in the simulations, as 
suggested by Darden et al. [20]. 
 
 in φ=-60°~-180°, and the backbone torsion angle ψ (ψ4/5 for biphalin and ψ4 for the tetrapeptide 
hydrazide) is mostly constrained in ψ=90°~180°(Figs. 5(a) and 5(b)). Nevertheless, the backbone 
torsion angle ψ4 in the tetrapeptide hydrazide can occasionally be found in the range ψ=0°~-90° (Fig. 
5(c)). As shown in Figs. 4 and 5, at residues D-Ala and Phe, the variable range for torsion angle φ is 
clearly somewhat wider than for torsion angle ψ. At residue Gly, however, both the backbone torsion 
angles φ and ψ vary in two rather large ranges, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6. Although not shown, 
all the torsion angles of the nitrogen-nitrogen bridge in the biphalin molecule, namely C4α-C4′-N9-N10, 
C4′-N9-N10-C5′, and N9-N10-C5′-C5α, are demonstrated all in trans-rotamer, but the torsion angle of the N-
N bridge C4α-C4′-N9-N10 in the tetrapeptide hydrazide can be in either trans or gauche conformations 
(Fig.7). Without consideration of the mentioned constrained backbone torsion angles, on one hand, the 
bioactive conformations of the biphalin molecule can be identified through the remaining 
conformational states of the rotatable bonds, namely the χ11/8, χ21/8, φ3/6, ψ3/6, χ14/5, and χ24/5 torsion 
angles, which are demonstrated accounting for the conformational flexibilities of the two peptides 
considered in this work. On the other hand, the bioactive conformations of the tetrapeptide hydrazide 
are identified through the torsion angles χ11, χ21, φ3, ψ3, ψ4, χ14, and χ24 and the torsion angle of the N-N 
bridge C4α-C4′-N9-N10. Figure 8 demonstrates the time evolutions of the side chain torsion angles, χ1, 
and χ2, at residues Tyr and Phe for the two fragments of biphalin and the tetrapeptide hydrazide, 
respectively. As shown, each of these side chain torsion angles varies in two ranges (for χ2) or three (for 
χ1), except the side chain torsion angle χ25 at residue Phe in the biphalin molecule, which is only in 
trans-rotamer. In general, it is clear known that bioactive opioid peptide chooses opioid receptor is 
depending on pharmacophoric distances and pharmacophoric torsion angle of side chains. Thus, the 
conformation samples obtained in the simulations can be divided into a finite number of conformers by 
the combination of all the specific torsion angles. Subsequently, the conformers suitable for binding to 
the μ or δ opioid receptors were selected by the larger probability of matching pharmacophoric 
distances according to the models proposed by Yamazaki et al. [14] and Shenderovich et al. [15], 
respectively. Simulation results show that, for the tetrapeptide hydrazide, there are totally 2985 and 540 
 affinity for binding to μ or δ receptors, is the constrained torsion angles of the N-N bridges C4α-C4′-N9-
N10 and N9-N10-C5′-C5α, which are only in trans conformation, while in the tetrapeptide hydrazide, the 
same torsion angle can vary among trans, gauche(+), and gauche(-) conformations. Another cause of 
the significantly increased δ receptor binding affinity for biphalin clearly is the constrained side chain 
torsion angle χ25 at residue Phe5 in the tetrapeptide fragment 5-8 of biphalin. Especially, the top three 
popular δ receptor binding conformers of biphalin have the satisfactory pharmacophoric distances 
occurring in the tetrapeptide fragment 5-8, i. e., most of the δ receptor binding conformations of 
biphalin bind to the δ receptor through the tetrapeptide fragment 5-8.

in the fragment 5-8 of biphalin and ψ1 in the tetrapeptide hydrazide are similar to that in the fragment 1-
