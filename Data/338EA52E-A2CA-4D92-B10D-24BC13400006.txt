Abstract 
SiGe metal-semiconductor-metal 
photodetectors (MSM-PDs) with a thin 
amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) passivation layer 
have been fabricated by an ultrahigh-vacuum 
chemical vapor deposition (UHVCVD) 
system. It was found that the thin (30 nm) 
a-Si:H passivation layer could effectively 
suppress the dark current of SiGe MSM-PDs. 
As compared to unpassivated devices, the 
dark current for devices with a-Si:H 
passivation layers was drastically reduced by 
1.7 x 105 and photo-to-dark current ratio was 
enhanced by 1.3 x 106. We attribute this result 
to the passivation effect of a-Si:H films on 
SiGe surfaces by hydrogen diffusion, which 
compensate the dangling bonds on the SiGe 
surface.

 Introduction 
 The requirements of Silicon-based 
photonic devices in the next generation of 
chip technologies have caused extensive 
studies on SiGe devices because strained SiGe 
exhibits several advantages, such as higher 
electron and hole mobility than Si, longer 
detection wavelength ( up to 1.6μm) for 
near-infrared optical detection, and the 
possibility for integration into existing Silicon 
technology [1-2]. In the past years, various 
types of SiGe-based optoelectronic devices 
[3-6] have been proposed. Among these 
devices, the metal-semiconductor-metal 
photodetectors (MSM-PDs) exhibit the 
highest response speed, owing to their 
ultralow intrinsic capacitance [12-13]. The 
fabrication process of MSM photodetector is 
also compatible with that of 
field-effect-transistor (FET). Thus, one can 
easily integrate SiGe MSM photodetectors 
with SiGe FET-based electronics to realize 
optoelectronic  
integrated circuits. However, up to now, 
the reported planar type MSM-PDs are few, to 
the best of our knowledge. In planar type 
MSM-PDs, both metals (anode and cathode) 
are on the surface of SiGe, which may contain 
many surface defect states caused by Ge 
atoms that were segregated during the growth 
of SiGe [7]. These surface defect states will 
play a detrimental role in the generation of a 
dark current because the current flows through 
the top SiGe layer in planar-type MSM-PDs.  
 In this work, an amorphous silicon 
(a-Si:H) layer was employed to passivate the 
SiGe surface, and a significant reduction in 
the dark current was achieved, as compared 
and B have the same dark current. It suggests 
that the PECVD-SiO2 has no passivating 
effect on SiGe surfaces. This may

Fig. 2  Dark and photo (850 nm) I-V 
characteristics of the fabricated MSM-PDs 
 
be attributed to plasma damage on the SiGe 
surface during PECVD-SiO2 deposition. The 
PECVD-SiO2 deposition damaged the SiGe 
surface due to ion bombardment, leading to 
more generated defect states on the SiGe 
surface. It has been reported that plasma 
irradiation involves displacement of Si and Ge 
atoms from their lattice sites, which creates 
point defects of vacancy-interstitial pairs [8-9]; 
these plasma created defects on SiGe surfaces 
were also found in our previous studies 
[10].The lowest dark current is observed in 
sample C. For instance, at 6 V, the dark 
current is 1.3×10-8 A, while sample A is 
2.1×10-3 A. Obviously, the dark current is 
reduced dramatically by a factor of 1.7 x 105 
for the a-Si:H passivated sample due to the 
reduction of surface states, which was caused 
by Ge out diffusion during growth of SiGe. 
The dark current density of sample C, having 
1.6 x 10-5 A/cm2, is much small than that (1 
A/cm2) of Cr-Ge-Cr MSM-PD [17] at 1 V and 
comparable with that of Cr-Si-Cr MSM-PD 
[16] having PECVD-SiO2 passivation. The 
MSM-PDs [16] fabricated by pure Si without 
Ge doping had a dark current density of 1.3 x 
10-4 A/cm2, which was much lower than that 
(2.6 A/cm2) of unpassivated SiGe MSM-PDs 
in this work. It has been pointed out that the 
hydrogen in a-Si:H can diffuse to the defect 
sites, effectively passivating dangling bond 
states. The passivation using a-Si:H films can 
easily compete with that of high-temperature 
(~1000 ℃) grown SiO2 [11].

Moreover, from Fig. 4-2, the sample C has 
higher photocurrent than those in samples A 
and B; the possible reasons are addressed 
below. In sample C, most of the 
photo-generated carriers in SiGe layer are 
directly swept into Au electrodes by electric 
field and some carriers are injected into a-Si:H 
layer. The injected carriers are captured by 
dangling bonds inside a-Si:H at lower voltage; 
hence a lower current is obtained as compared 
to that of sample B. But at higher voltage, 
these captured carriers will be emitted, thus 
the current increases with the applied bias 
voltage and finally becomes to be saturated as 
a result of complete emission of captured 
carriers. In our previous study [20], the 
a-Si1-xGex:H layer will be formed at the 
interface of p-SiGe/a-Si:H due to Ge atoms 
out-diffusion during the growth of a-Si:H. The 
photo-absorption of a-Si1-xGex:H and 
passivated surface of sample C are the 
possible reasons for such high photocurrent.
