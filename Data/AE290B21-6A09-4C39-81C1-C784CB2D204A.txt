An elastic Bernoulli–Euler beam model is developed for thermal-mechanical 
vibration and buckling instability of a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) 
conveying fluid and resting on an elastic medium by using the theories of thermal 
elasticity mechanics and nonlocal elasticity. The differential quadrature method is 
adopted to obtain the numerical solutions to the model. The effects of temperature 
change, nonlocal parameter and elastic medium constant on the vibration frequency 
and buckling instability of SWCNT conveying fluid are investigated. It can be 
concluded that at low or room temperature, the first natural frequency and critical 
flow velocity for the SWCNT increase as the temperature change increases, on the 
contrary, while at high temperature the first natural frequency and critical flow 
velocity decrease with the increase of the temperature change. The first natural 
frequency for the SWCNT decreases as the nonlocal parameter increases, both the 
first natural frequency and critical flow velocity increase with the increase of the 
elastic medium constant. 
 Keywords: Nonlocal elasticity, Temperature change, Vibration frequency,

1. INTRODUCTION 
Since the landmark paper by Iijima [1], Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted 
worldwide attention due to their potential use in the fields of chemistry, physics, 
nano-engineering, electrical engineering and materials science. Carbon nanotubes 
(CNTs) are adopted for a variety of technological and biomedical applications 
including nanocontainers for gas storage and nanopipes conveying fluids [2~7]. 
Recently, the analysis of CNTs has been of great interest to many researchers because 
of their exceptional mechanical, electronic, electrochemical, physical and thermal 
properties [8~12]. The classic elastic continuum models have been widely used to 
study the vibration behavior of CNTs. Yoon et al. [9,13] investigated the effect of 
moving internal fluid on free vibration and flow-induced flutter instability of 
cantilever carbon nanotubes based on a continuum elastic model. It was concluded 
that the resonance frequencies depended on the fluid-flow velocity. Structural 
instability of the CNTs could occur at a critical flow velocity. However, the effects of 
flow velocity on the resonance frequencies and the instability of CNTs would be 
changed when the CNTs is embedded in a complaint surrounding elastic medium such 
as polymer matrix. Reddy et al. [14] studied the influence of fluid flow on the free 
vibration and instability of fluid-conveying single-walled carbon nanotubes 
(SWCNTs). Wang et al. [15] developed Timoshenko beam model and DQ method for 
free vibration analysis of multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Zhang et al. [16] adopted a

tensor at x, and ′ε(x )  is the strain tensor at any point x′ in the body. The kernel 
function (| |, )α τ′ −x x  is the nonlocal modulus, | |′ −x x is the Euclidean distance, 
and 0 /e a lτ =  , where 0e  is a constant appropriate to each material, a is an internal 
characteristic size (e.g. size of C–C bond, lattice spacing, granular distance) and l is 
an external characteristic size (crack size, wave length etc.). The volume integral in 
Eq. (1) is over the region V occupied by the body. The kernel function is given as [21] 
2 1
0(| |, ) (2 ) ( / )l K lα τ π τ−= ⋅x x x                                   (2) 
where 0K  is the modified Bessel function.  
By incorporating Eq. (1) and (2), the following equation can be derived  
     2 2 20 0(1 ) :e a− ∇ =σ C ε                                             (3) 
It is noted that the scale 0e a  in the Eq. (3) will lead to small scale effect on the 
response of structures in nano-size, furthermore, the classical (local) elasticity theory 
is recovered if the scale coefficient 0e a  is set to be zero. 
3. THERMAL-NONLOCAL BEAM MODEL FOR SWCNTS CONVEYING 
FLUID 
Many studies indicated that the classic Euler-elastic beam presents a simple and 
reliable model for an overall mechanical deformation of CNTs, provided the 
characteristic wavelength is much larger than the diameter of CNTs. Therefore, the 
present work investigates the effects of temperature change, nonlocal small scale and 
elastic medium constant on the vibration frequency and buckling instability of 
fluid-conveying SWCNT described by the nonlocal elasticity theory and classic 
Bernoulli–Euler beam model, as shown in Fig. 1. In the present study, CNT is 
assumed to be simply supported at both ends, and embedded into an elastic medium 
such as polymer. The length of the nanotube is denoted as L . 
The gravity effect is neglected as usual. Thus, let the mean flow velocity and the 
mass per unit length of the fluid be V  and M , respectively. The governing 
equation for thermal vibration and structural instability of a CNT conveying fluid 
based on nonlocal elasticity theory can be derived as

weighted linear sum of the values of ( , )iw x t  with 1,2, ,i N= … .

in which the subscript b  represents the elements associated with the boundary points 
(at the two ends of the CNT conveying fluid), while d  represents the remainder. The

For a self-excited vibration, the solution of Eq. (7) can be written as

where

and { }w  is defined as an undetermined function of vibration amplitude. Im( )λ  is 
the natural frequency of the CNT conveying fluid.  
Substitution of Eq. (8) into Eq. (7) yields a homogeneous equation, which 
corresponds to the generalized eigenvalue problem

To obtain a non-trivial solution of Eq. (10), the determinant of the coefficient 
matrix must vanish, that is, 
[ ] [ ] [ ]( )2det 0M C Kλ λ+ + = .          (11) 
Based on the above equation, the eigenvalues of the fluid-conveying CNTs can be 
computed for various parameter values.

critical flow velocity, the increase of the temperature change tends to decrease the 
natural frequencies of the SWCNT as it can be detected from Fig. 3, which is contrary 
to the case of low or room temperature. Furthermore, it is noted that the critical flow 
velocity becomes much smaller as the temperature change gets increased, which is 
also contrary to the case of low or room temperature.  
Fig. 4 depicts the variation of first frequency of SWCNT with flow velocity for 
different values of 0 /e a L  in low or room temperature. As it is found from Fig. 4 that 
the natural frequency is significantly influenced by the nonlocal parameter 0 /e a L , 
while the critical flow velocity is much less influenced by the nonlocal 
parameter 0 /e a L . The nonlocal parameter 0 / 0e a L =  denotes the result obtained by 
classical Euler beam model. As the nonlocal parameter increases, the first natural 
frequency decreases. Fig. 5 presents the variation of first frequency of SWCNT with 
flow velocity for different values of 0 /e a L  in high temperature. Similar phenomena 
can be drawn in Fig. 5. as those in Fig. 4 except that the first natural frequencies and 
the critical flow velocities are smaller due to the case of high temperature. 
Fig. 6 presents the variation of first frequency of SWCNT with flow velocity for 
different values of Winkler constant K  in low or room temperature. It is found that 
both the natural frequency and critical flow velocity are significantly influenced by 
Winkler constant. As the elastic medium constant K increases, the first frequency also 
increases, which is reasonable since increasing the elastic medium constant makes the 
SWCNT stronger. The critical flow velocity also increases with the increase of the 
elastic medium constant K. Fig. 7 presents the variation of first frequency of SWCNT 
with flow velocity for different values of Winkler constant K  in high temperature. 
Similar phenomena can be drawn in Fig. 7. as those in Fig. 6 except that the first 
natural frequencies and the critical flow velocities are smaller due to the case of high 
temperature. Based on the results in Figs. 2-7, the effects of temperature change, 
nonlocal parameter and elastic medium constant are very significant on the first 
natural frequency and critical flow velocity of fluid-conveying SWCNT embedded in 
an elastic medium.

Since the landmark paper by Iijima [1], Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted worldwide 
attention due to their potential use in the fields of chemistry, physics, nano-engineering, electrical 
engineering and materials science. CNTs can be used as strong, light and high toughness fibers for 
composite structures, parts of nano-devices and for hydrogen storage (Bachtold et al. [2]; 
Dresselhaus and Avouris [3]; Tu and Yang [4]; Lau and Hui [5]). In this paper, small scale effect 
on flow-induced instability of double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) is investigated using an 
elastic shell model based on Donnell’s shell theory. The dynamic governing equations of 
DWCNTs are derived on the basis of nonlocal elasticity theory, in addition, the van der Waals 
(vdW) interaction between the inner and outer walls is considered in the shell modeling. The 
instability of DWCNTs that is induced by a pressure-driven steady flow is studied. The numerical 
computations indicate that as the flow velocity increases, DWNCTs have a way to get through 
multi-bifurcations of the first and second bifurcations in turn. It can be concluded that the critical 
flow velocity of the flow-induced instability is closely correlated to the ratio of the length to the 
radius of DWCNTs, the pressure of the fluid and the small scale effects. Furthermore, it is 
interesting to notice that as the small scale effects are considered, the first critical flow velocities of 
DWCNTs decrease as compared to the results with the classical (local) continuum mechanics, 
therefore, the small scale effects play an important role on performing the instability analysis in the 
fluid-conveying DWCNTs.

Small scale effect on flow-induced instability of double-walled carbon

scale effect was clarified in elasticity by assuming the stress to be a functional of 
the strain field at every point in the body. In this sense, the internal size scale 
could be considered simply as a material parameter in the constitutive equations. 
The application of nonlocal elasticity models in nanomaterials was proposed by 
Peddieson et al. (2003). They applied the nonlocal elasticity to formulate a 
nonlocal version of Euler–Bernoulli beam model, and concluded that nonlocal 
continuum mechanics could potentially play an important role in nanotechnology 
applications. Further applications of the nonlocal continuum mechanics have been 
utilized in investigating the mechanical behavior of CNTs. Sudak (2003) 
investigated the infinitesimal column buckling of multi-walled nanotubes 
(MWNTs) combining not only van der Waals forces but also the effects of small 
length scales. His results demonstrated that as the small length scale gets larger in 
magnitude the critical axial strain gets smaller compared to the results with 
classical continuum mechanics. Zhang et al. (2004) investigated a nonlocal 
multi-shell model for the axial buckling of MWNTs under axial compression. 
Their results indicated that both the buckling mode and the length of tubes have 
contributions to the influence of the small scale on the axial buckling strain. 
Zhang et al., (2005a, 2005b) adopted the theory of nonlocal elasticity to 
investigate free transverse vibrations of double-walled carbon nanotubes. Wang

fluid-conveying MWCNTs with the consideration of the van der Waals (vdW) 
interaction has been presented in the study (Yan et al., 2007).  The purpose of 
the present paper is to investigate the small scale effects on the flow-induced 
instability of double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) using Donnell’s shell 
model. 
2. Nonlocal elasticity theory 
Based on Eringen nonlocal elasticity model (Eringen, 1983), the stress at a reference 
point x in a body is considered as a function of strains of all the points in the near 
region. The above assumption is in agreement with the atomic theory of lattice 
dynamics and experimental observations on phonon dispersion.  
Consider a homogeneous and isotropic elastic solid, the constitutive equation is 
0( ) : (| |, ) ( ) ( )

characteristic size (e.g. size of C–C bond, lattice spacing, granular distance) and l is

Finally, the characteristic equation of the system of Eq. (38) is described as 
( ) ( )det 0I Cλ − =⎡ ⎤⎣ ⎦ ,                                        (39) 
where (I) is an identity matrix and (C) is the coefficient matrix of the right-hand 
side of Eq. (38), and λ  is the eigenvalue of the system. In general, the eigenvalue 
is a complex number. Its real part implies an attenuation/amplification factor of 
the vibration amplitude due to the dissipation of the energy from the flow, and the 
imaginary part represents the modal frequency of the system. Obviously, the 
eigenvalue is a function of the flow velocity. As the flow velocity increases, the 
effective stiffness of the system decreases due to the effects of centrifugal force 
and/or Coriolis force. When the flow velocity inside the inner tube increases to 
certain value, the effective stiffness of the system diminishes, namely, the 
imaginary part goes to zero. At this moment, the instability occurs and the 
corresponding flow velocity is referred to as the critical velocity.

after that the tube loses stability due to having a positive real part as shown in Fig. 
2(b). This implies that the tube absorbs energy from the flow to amplify the 
vibration. However, when the flow velocity is continually up to 
smUr /2626= (for nmae 0.00 = ) or smUr /2586= (for nmae 0.10 = ) or 
smUr /2476= (for nmae 0.20 = ), the stability is restored, and then the second 
instability (flutter instability) comes rapidly at smU f /3514= (for nmae 0.00 = ) or 
smU f /3454= (for nmae 0.10 = ) or smU f /3308= (for nmae 0.20 = ). In the case 
of 50/ 2 =RL , the bifurcating characteristics become more complicated than 
in the case of 10/ 2 =RL  since the comparative stiffness of the system is smaller. 
For instance, before the flutter instability comes into effect, first divergence 
instability and restabilization occur very closely at smUd /1457= and 
smUr /1462=  (for nmae 0.00 = ) or smUd /1436=  and smUr /1442= (for 
nmae 0.10 = ) or smUd /1380= and smUd /1385=  (for nmae 0.20 = ). For the 
case of n=5, similar bifurcation of the system are shown in Fig. 4 and 5 
respectively. The details of the comparisons are listed in Table 1. Based on the 
numerical computations presented in Table 1 and Figs 2-5, it can be concluded that 
the critical flow velocity is closely correlated to the ratio of the length to the radius 
of DWCNTs, the pressure of the fluid and the small scale effects. Furthermore, it is 
interesting to notice that as the small scale effects are considered, the first critical
