aqueous solution of said acid (Hermann and Gebauer, 1998). According to the study of Chou et al.
(1996), the organic compounds dissolving in spent acid were oxidized into carbon dioxide by
hydroxyl radical (OH), generated from anodic oxidation of water. Therefore, regeneration of
spent sulfuric acid could be carried out in a single unit.
Until now, numerous investigations have dealt with the oxidative degradation of organic
compounds contained in spent acid. In our previous paper (Chen et al., 2005a), high purity of
2,4-DNT could be recovered from spent acid by simply diluting or refrigerating method. This
work explores the feasibility of solvent extraction of organic compounds, e.g. dinitrotoluene
isomers and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene from spent acid of toluene nitration process. Hexane and
heptane were selected as the solvent due to their common usage industrially (Robbins, 1980; Lee
et al., 2002). The effects of operating temperature, volume ratio of solvent versus acid, spent
sulfuric acid concentration and organic compounds content on the removal of total organic
compounds were elucidated. It is remarkable that not only organic compounds but also water
contents of spent acid were diminished significantly. Thus, it reveals that the method established
could be in use to regenerate spent acid.
2. Experimental
2.1. Extraction testing
Extraction tests were performed in an autoclave system (referred to Chen et al., 2005b)
under atmospheric pressure at 300 K, 323 K and 343 K, respectively. Prior to tests, a
proportionate amount of spent acid was situated in the autoclave. The identical amount (volume
basis) of hexane or heptane (99.5 %, Fluka ) was supplied by a liquid metering pump. The
extractor was made of stainless steel 316, and equipped with both cooling circulation bath and
heating jacket. One thermocouple was inserted into the extracting zone for reading and
controlling the temperature. The flow rate of gas effluent was measured by a wet-type gas meter.
The typical spent acid was composed of H2SO4: HNO3: H2O: Organic compounds = 74.3: 2.7:
21.97: 1.03 on the weight basis. At the beginning of extraction tests, the spent sulfuric acid
concentration and organic compounds content were adjusted in the range of 46.974.3 wt% and
1.031.64 wt% respectively. After extraction experiment (ca. 8 minutes), the extract decanted
from the extractor was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Hewlett Packard 6890 SERIES)
equipped with a flame ionization detector. A capillary column (DB-1, 100m x 0.25mm, film
thickness 0.5m) operated from 373 K to 493 K was used to identify the compositions.
Furthermore, the raffinate was undergone both total organic compounds and Karl-Fischer
analyses to evaluate the organic compounds and water contents.
To find out the steady state concentration of organic compounds residual in spent acid, six
stages of extracting treatment were carried out in series. The extracting percentage of
dinitrotoluene isomers and trinitrotoluene in each stage respectively was defined as follows, e.g.
2,4-DNT was defined as shown :
2,4-DNT (%) =

2.2. Gas chromatograph/Mass spectrometer analysis (GC/MS)
The proportionate amount (0.3l) of extract was injected into a gas chromatograph/mass
distribution was listed in Table 2. With regard to the weight ratios of dinitrotoluene isomers, e.g.
2,4-DNT: 2,6-DNT: 2,3-DNT: 3,4-DNT = 78.59: 17.90: 0.42: 1.53 in the case of hexane, it
appears that dinitrotoluene isomers dissolving in aqueous spent acid are in equilibrium with their
isomers in organic product of toluene nitration process, of which compositions are as follows:
2,4-DNT: 2,6-DNT: 2,3-DNT: 3,4-DNT = 77: 18: 1.3: 2.8. Additionally, similar weight ratios of
dinitrotoluene isomers of the extracts were also observed for the case of heptane. That provides
another piece of evidence for above hypothesis, as consistent with our previous report (Chen et
al., 2005a). Furthermore, the content of dinitrotoluene isomers in spent acid was extracted
completely by hexane after 18 extraction stages. As expected, similar weight ratios of
dinitrotoluene isomers were obtained, i.e. 2,4-DNT: 2,6-DNT: 2,3-DNT: 3,4-DNT = 78.51: 17.80:
0.44: 1.60.

3,4-DNT > 2,4-DNT > 2,4,6-TNT. This fact supports strongly our previous hypothesis of
extracting priority of organic compounds contained in spent acid.
3.3. Effect of spent sulfuric acid concentration
For the sake of enhancing recovery of dinitrotoluenes and trinitrotoluene from spent acid, the
concentration of spent acid was adjusted by diluting manner. Effect of spent sulfuric acid
concentration on the removal of organic compounds is illustrated in Figure 5. Apparently, the
concentration of organic compounds was significantly decreasing at lower concentration of
sulfuric acid in comparison with those of higher ones. In other words, the extracting efficiency of
lower concentration of sulfuric acid was superior to those of higher ones. It may be ascribed to
the solubility of organic compounds in aqueous spent acid, which depends strongly upon the
concentration of spent sulfuric acid. Namely, high concentration of spent sulfuric acid promotes
solubility of organic compounds in aqueous phase, corresponding to other publications
(Venugopal et al., 1996).
As far as the removed content of organic compounds is concerned, it reaches a level as high
as 68% of the feedstock at first stage under the 46.9 wt% concentration of spent sulfuric acid.
One may deduce that the recovered percentage of organic compounds from spent acid would
increase under lower concentration of sulfuric acid. It reveals the solvent extraction method
established is promising in recovery of dinitrotoluenes and trinitrotoluene from the wastewater
stream of toluene nitration process.
3.4. Effect of organic compounds content
Figure 6 demonstrates the influence of organic compounds content on the extracting
behavior by heptane among six extraction stages. The residual amount of organic compounds in
the case of low organic compounds content of the feedstock(1.03 wt%) was significantly less
than that of high one (1.65 wt%). Whereas, organic compounds extracted reaches nearly 78% for
the former, which is almost equivalent to that of the latter. It means the extracting tests were
kinetically controlled on account of short contact time (8 minutes). Nonetheless, high content of
organic compounds in the feedstock has been reduced to the value of about 2600 ppm in further
extracting stages. Therefore, the residual content of organic compounds in spent acid depends
upon the spent sulfuric acid concentration, and is independent of organic compounds contents of
the feedstock.
4. Conclusion
On the basis of the above discussion, it seems that dinitrotoluene isomers dissolving in
aqueous spent acid are in equilibrium with their isomers in organic product of toluene nitration
process. High volume ratio of solvent/acid and extracting temperature are more beneficial to
recover dinitrotoluenes and trinitrotoluene. Moreover, high concentration of spent sulfuric acid
enhances solubility of organic compounds in aqueous phase. That leads to lower extracting
efficiency. Further, in both cases of hexane and heptane, the extracting priority of organic
compounds is as follows: 2,3-DNT > 2,6-DNT > 3,4-DNT > 2,4-DNT > 2,4,6-TNT.
