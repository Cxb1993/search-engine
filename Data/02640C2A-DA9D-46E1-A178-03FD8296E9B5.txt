but can also wastes much social cost 
and resource. The problems of spam 
for all network users are unavoidable 
and eliminating spam is a necessity.

To deal with the problems of 
spam, many spam filtering methods 
have been proposed. Support Vector 
Machine (SVM) is one of the most 
widely used machine learning 
techniques for classification and 
regression developed by V. Vapnik, 
and has better performance to be 
applied to text classification, pattern 
segment and spam classification, etc. 
The same as many machine learning 
techniques, we use the concept of 
feature to train our classifier. However, 
the importance of features which are 
belonging to spam or legitimate mail is 
different for each addressee. Based on 
this situation, this research proposed a 
modified fuzzy membership function 
for Support Vector Machine called 
FMCSVM to make the features with 
different importance or weighting. We 
set this fuzzy membership function by 
analyzing the characteristics of spam 
features and hope that it can improve 
the performance of spam classification 
problem. This study will compare the 
Precision and Recall of proposed 
classifier and others classifiers. 
2. FMCSVM 
In this project, we treat SPAM 
detection as a two-class pattern 
classification problem and we propose 
a classifier which is called FMCSVM 
to determine whether a mail is spam or 
legitimate. Furthermore, the proposed 
fuzzy membership function is applied 
to SVM by the concept of spam 
features. We set this fuzzy membership 
function by analyzing the 
characteristics of spam features. 
2.1  Feature Selection 
The spam which we are trying to 
classify is text messages in 
classification problem, but these text 
messages (i.e. strings) are not very 
convenient type to handle. Most of the 
machine learning algorithms can only 
classify numerical objects (real 
numbers or vectors) or otherwise 
require some measure of similarity 
between the objects (a distance metric 
or scalar product). 
To solve this problem, we have to 
convert all messages to vectors of 
numbers (feature vectors) and then 
classify these vectors using a 
pre-processor. The pre-processor will 
convert all input mail to feature vectors 
Step1. Establish planning group, 
which includes decision-makers of the 
problems. 
Step2. Select the experts investigated. 
In common, we choose 10 to 15 
persons. 
Step3. Planning group designed the 
first Delphi questionnaire based on the 
possibility of spam with specific 
features in the email are sent to the 
experts. 
Step4. The possibility of spam could 
be ranked by analyzing and integrating 
the opinions of experts after retrieving 
the questionnaire. 
Step5. Consulting the opinions of 
Step4, the second Delphi questionnaire 
was designed and sent to experts for 
asking their opinions. 
Step6. The same as Step4. 
Step7. Check whether the different 
opinions converge to a certain extent 
(the coefficient of variation should 
lower than 0.15). If common consensus 
is not achieved, Step5 to step7 should 
be repeated. 
Step8. When common consensus is 
achieved, the ranking order is the final 
opinion of experts with common 
consensus. 
2.3 Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
Suppose that a given set S  with 
l  labeled training points ( ) ( )ll yxyx ,,...,, 11  
and each training point N
i Rx ∈  with a 
label }1,1{ −+∈iy  for li ,...,1=  belongs to 
either of two classes. As shown in 
Figure 3, the idea of SVM is to find a 
hyperplane ( ) bxwxf H +⋅=  which 
divides the set of examples such that 
all the points with the same label are 
on the same side. For a given training 
set, while there may exist many 
hyperplanes that separate the two 
classes, the SVM classifier is to find 
the hyperplane with the largest margin 
between the two different classes [3]. 
The margin ( )bwD ,  can be calculated 
as

Therefore, the optimal hyperplane 
can be considered as the solution of the 
convex quadratic programming 
problem:

non-negative Lagrange multipliers.

2.4 The Combination of Fuzzy 
Membership and SVM 
The feature counts are usually 
treated as the input data for SVM to 
train the classifier. However, the 
reason for using the feature count as 
input data to SVM may be insufficient 
in spam classification. Therefore, in 
our proposed FMCSVM, we apply not 
only the concept of feature count but 
also the fuzzy membership of features 
from the Delphi Survey Method. In 
other words, the values of feature 
counts are multiplied by the possibility 
of spam with specific features in the 
email to represent the input data of 
SVM. The input data of SVM is 
composed of the possibility of spam 
and feature count. 
2.5 Performance Evaluation 
In order to validate the result of 
spam classification problem,  , a 
better evaluated function is a necessity. 
The evaluated functions not only 
evaluate the classification performance 
of the proposed two-stage classifier, 
but also be the criterion the proposed 
classifier and the others methods. Two 
common evaluated functions in the 
spam classification rates, precision 
rateand recall rate are utilized [5]. The 
related notations and definitions are

classified as legitimate mails. This is 
an error type of false negatives. 
SLN → ：  The number of 
misclassified mail where legitimate 
mails are classified as spam. This is an 
error type of false positives. 
3. Experiment Process and 
Resultsbb 
3.1 Data Source 
 In this research, we use the 
Ling-Spam data set for the experiment, 
and there are 2 classes in this data set 
including spam and legitimate mail. 
Ling-Spam is composed of 481 spam 
mail and 2412 legitimate mail from the 
collection of researcher 
Androutsopoulos [1]. In the 
Ling-Spam data set, 10 subdirectories 
(part1, ..., part10) have been separated 
randomly, and each one of the 10 
subdirectories contains both spam and 
legitimate mail. In each repetition, one 
part was reserved for testing and the 
other 9 were used for training. Files 
whose names have the form spmsg*.txt 
are spam mail and all other files are 
legitimate mail. In our experiment, 92 
features are generated from the 
reference.

4 Conclusions 
In this research, we propose a 
classifier FMCSVM to spam 
classification problem. First, the 
possibility of spam with specific 
features in the email is generated from 
Fuzzy Theory Delphi Survey Method. 
Then, we combine the possibility of 
spam with feature count as input data 
to the SVM. The results of experiment 
show that FMCSVM classifier has the 
best precision and recall rate than other 
classification methods.
