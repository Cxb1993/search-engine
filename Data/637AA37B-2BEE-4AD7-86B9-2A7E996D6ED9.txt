(一)英文摘要。 
   This project considers a tracking problem for a class of uncertain time-delay discrete systems 
through genetic algorithm (GA) approach based on linear matrix inequality. The system under 
consideration is described in state space model containing state delays, norm-bounded parameter 
uncertainty appearing in the matrices of the system model. The aim is to design a tracking control 
so that an H∞  tracking performance, which is related to the tracking output error for some 
bounded inputs, is formulated. Sufficient conditions are derived for the robust asymptotic tracking 
controller via genetic algorithm (GA) technique in the format of linear matrix inequality (LMI). Up 
to date, however, no results on robust delay-dependent H ∞ tracking control problem for time-delay 
discrete systems is available in the literature, this problem is still open and remains challenging. 
Some numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed theory. 
Keywords: robust control, time-delay system, uncertainty, linear matrix inequality

 In this case, the state feedback controller is designed via GA technique as  
)()( keKku s= .                                                          (6) 
After substituting (5) and (6) into (1), one has  
)()())(()()())(()1( kwkKekBBhkxAkxkAAkx d +Δ++−+Δ+=+ .                    (7) 
Let )()( kLekz =  represent the state error, where L  is a known constant matrix. 
We now introduce the extended state vector and the external disturbance vector as follows

The purpose of this paper is to construct the state feedback controller, which satisfies all 
admissible uncertainties, the asymptotically stable augmented system (9) and guarantees the robust 
H ∞  tracking performance related to the tracking state error )(kz , simultaneously,

where γ  is a prescribed attenuation level. The physical meaning of (14) is that the effect of any 
)(kξ  on the tracking state error )(kz  must be attenuated below a desired level γ  from the 
viewpoint of energy, no matter what )(kξ  is, i.e., the L2  gain from )(kξ  to )(kz  must be 
equal to or less than a prescribed value γ 2 . The following lemmas play a crucial role in designing a 
desired robust H ∞  tracking performance for the uncertain time-delay system (1).

selection method in which μ  parents and λ  offspring compete for survival and the μ  best 
out of both the old parents and the old offspring are selected as parents of the next generation 
[18]. If the termination condition (maximum number of iteration) of GA is reached, then stop; 
otherwise, go to 3.
