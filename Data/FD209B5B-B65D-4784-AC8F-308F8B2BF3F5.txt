ABSTRACT 
 The main purpose of this study is to propose an evaluation method that can be used for analyzing the 
time-dependent seismic reliability of RC buildings located in a corrosive environment with high seismic 
hazard. In this study, several models have been developed to investigate the deterioration induced by chloride 
ingress in order to estimate the initiation stage and rate of corrosion and to analyze the structural capacity of 
columns and beams with corroded reinforcing bars; then, the seismic evaluation for RC framed buildings was 
used for calculating the story shear capacity of each floor in a building. In addition, the hazard curve of the 
story shear demand for each floor obtained from the seismic hazard analysis was adopted; consequently, a 
Monte Carlo simulation was carried out for estimating the annual failure probability and seismic reliability 
index of the concerned building; in other words, a time-dependent seismic reliability function could be built.

each floor can be estimated assuming Ai, W, and Fes are deterministic values; then, Figure 2 could be 
transformed into the hazard curve of the story shear force for each floor, as shown in Figure 3. Because the 
average chloride content in the atmosphere of ShiMen has not been conclusively determined as yet, different 
surface chloride contents for the building, i.e., oC = 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0 kg/m3 (mean value of surface chloride 
content) were assumed in this study, and the expected story shear strength or capacity of each floor was 
calculated, as shown in Figure 4; consequently, based on Figure 7, these results could be transferred into the 
annual failure probability of each case, as shown in Figure 5. According to the results, when a specified 
service period of 100 years was set, the annual failure probability of the building attacked by 1.5 kg/m3 of 
surface chloride content did not change significantly but increased by more than 10% under the condition of 
3.0 kg/m3 of surface chloride content, which is four times the failure probability of the initial construction 
(2.68%).  
If the probability density of failure is the standard normal distribution, the annual seismic reliability index 
can be estimated as shown in Figure 6. It was clear that when the surface chloride content was 3.0 kg/m3, the 
annual seismic reliability declined at a faster rate than in the other cases. However, according to the seismic 
reliability function shown in Figure 7, when the durable service life was set to 50 years on the basis of Civil 
law of Taiwan, the seismic reliability or safety probability of each case was below 30%; in other words, for 
this specified durable service life, repair and retrofit works were needed to upgrade the seismic reliability to 
more than 85% or the value that could be decided by the owner or user.

III. Conclusion 
In this study, we described a method for estimating the annual failure probability and seismic reliability 
index of a corroded RC building induced by chloride ingress. Using with the deterioration model caused by 
chloride ingress, we could build the time-dependent seismic reliability function. By means of the case study, 
the method that we proposed was proved to be a useful tool that could be used for arranging maintenance 
plans. However, for enhancing the practicability of this method, it is necessary to modify several empirical 
models used in this study on the basis of local environmental conditions in the following research work. 
Besides the corrosion induced by chloride ingress, corrosion induced by carbonation could be simulated using 
the same reliability analysis. Although, in this study, the type of corroded RC buildings was limited to a 
framed structure, we will develop more feasible models that can be applied to other structural types in the 
future.
