Abstract
The research project will focus on precise control over phase behavior and
nanostructure size in thin film and bulk using mixtures of diblock copolymers and
homopolymers. First of all, fundamental relationships of species solubility, volume
fraction, molecular weight and segment interaction with the size and the types of
microdomains will be established based on structure characterizations by
transmission/scanning electron microscopy (TEM/SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM)
and X-ray scattering/diffraction. Furthermore, the effects of solvent evaporation and
annealing on the orientation of nanostructures in thin-film diblock
copolymers/homopolymers mixtures are investigated by in-situ grazing incident X-ray
scattering technology combined with environmental controls of temperature and humility.

vapor for different time periods (15 –360
min) of solvent annealing, which was
carried out at a maintained temperature of
25 oC and humidity of less 20 %.
Characterization To determine the
nanodomains, we investigated the surface of
the thin films by atomic force microscope
(AFM, SPA400 Seiko) in the tapping mode
3. Results and Discussion
In order to investigate the effect of the
substrate interfaces on the fusion/fission
process of PS-b-P4VP spherical micelles in
solvent vapor, we performed solvent
annealing experiments on P(S224VP22) films
on SiOx/Si, PS4k-SiOx/Si and PS19k-SiOx/Si
substrates using THF vapor which is a good
solvent for the PS block. Also, a P(S414VP25)
film on SiOx/Si was annealed in THF for
comparison. Figure 1 shows the kinetics of
the sphere-to-lamellae transition of micelles
in the presence of a PS monolayer grafted
onto SiOx/Si with solvent annealing in THF.
As shown in Figure 1(A) displaying the
variation of micelles as a function of
solvent-annealing time, the fusion and
fission process was shown to be strongly
dependent on the length of the PS
homopolymers or PS blocks. For
P(S224VP22) thin films, the growth curve of
lamellar nanodomains from spherical
micelles thorough fusion on PS4k-SiOx/Si is
the fastest in comparison with those on
SiOx/Si and PS19k-SiOx/Si. A complete
transition to lamellae nanodomains was
reached within one hour. However, the
lamellar nanodomains only remained stable
until the time period of solvent annealing
reached 150 min, beyond which the lamellae
became unstable and progressively
transformed into form sphere nanodomains
though fission. In contrast, no
spherical-to-lamellar transition occurred for
P(S414VP25) thin films with solvent
annealing in THF. Figure 1(B) presents
plane view AFM images of P(S224VP22) thin
films on PS4k-SiOx/Si and SiOx/Si.
P(S224VP22) thin films on SiOx/Si only
reveal a mixture of spherical micelles
(major portion) and short lamellar
nanodomains (minor portion) coexisting
during solvent annealing.
Figure 2 illustrates the possible
mechanisms that brush conformation
anchored or grafted onto the hydrophilic
surface of SiOx/Si could be involved in the
transition of spherical micelles to lamellar
nanodomains within PS-b-P4VP thin films
with solvent annealing in THF. As
PS-b-P4VP micelles were spun on SiOx/Si
from solution, because of an interaction
between the hydroxyl surface of SiOx/Si and
the P4VP block, it is likely that a wetting
layer of PS-b-P4VP is anchored on a solid
with P4VP blocks at the solid-monolayer
surface and with PS blocks facing outward,
evidenced by the featureless surface of the
underlying layer. Since THF is a good
solvent for PS but poor for P4VP, solvent
annealing in THF would cause the P4VP
chains to shrink so as to reduce the contact
area with THF while conversely the PS
chains preferentially swollen by THF have
high tendency to occupy the outmost layer
and cover the P4VP domains located
underneath.7 The chains conformations of
PS and P4VP within the wetting monolayer
are analogous to those within the assembled
micelles of PS-b-P4VP, namely, swollen PS
corona blocks and shrunk P4VP core blocks
in THF. The solvent-driven shrinkage of
anchored P4VP chains with a low anchored
density might impart free space for the
occupation of PS corona chains of the
wetting layer so that the PS chains might be
in a mushroom-like conformation rather
than brush-like conformation. As a result,
the interpenetration and entanglement of PS
chains of PS-b-P4VP micelles and the
underlying wetting layer decreases the
motion of spherical micelles, slowing down
merging of spherical micelles through
fusion to form lamellar nanodomains.
Although P4VP chains act as a
“binding agent” to anchor a layer of
PS-b-P4VP onto SiOx/Si, the P4VP chains
within the wetting monolayer may not
significantly influence the fusion process of
micelles. In comparison, the length of the
PS chains has a profound effect on fusion

kg/mol, Ip=1.19), random copolymer (briefly
denoted as PS-r-PMMA: Mn = 14 kg/mol,
Ip=1.24) and polystyrene-block- poly(methyl
methacrylate) (P(S-b-MMA), (Mn = 82 kg/mol,
fps = 72 % and fP4VP = 28 %, Ip = 1.07) were
purchased (Polymer Source, Inc.) and used as
received.
Film Preparation and Annealing P(S-b-MMA)
films (thickness 34.2 or 36.4 nm) were
prepared via spin coating at 5000 rpm for 30 s
from P(S-b-MMA) solutions (1.4 and 1.5
mass %) in toluene. Annealing the samples at
170, 190, 210, 230 and 245 oC in a closed hot
stage (HCS402 Instec) purged with gaseous
N2 caused dewetting of the P(S-b-MMA)
films on SiOx/Si and the modified SiOx/Si
substrates.
Characterization To determine the
nanodomains and dewetted morphologies, we
investigated the surface of the thin films by
atomic force microscope (AFM, SPA400
Seiko) and Grazing-incidence Small-angle
X-ray Scattering (GISAXS, at BL23A in
NSRRC).
3. Results and Discussion
In order to investigate the dewetted
morphologies on SiOx/Si and different
modified substrate. We could observe the
dewetted morphologies transition in figure 1.
The AFM topographies in Figure 1 show
the dewetted morphologies of isothermally
annealed films. Upon annealing at
temperatures 170, 190, 210, 230 and 245 oC
for 12 h, the P(S-b-MMA) films (initial
thickness 36.4 nm) dewetted on SiOx/Si
according to a mechanism of nucleation and
growth, causing the film surface to acquire an
undulating thickness. The series of AFM
images display a dewetting process that
involves in the four stages (i) rupture of the
film (Fig. 1(a)), (ii) formation of holes with
uneven wavy rims (Fig. 1(b)(c)), (iii)
progressive growth of the rims until impinging
together to form a polygonal network (Fig. 1(c)
and (d)), and (iv) final breaking of the
polygonal network into micro-drops or
micro-slabs (Fig. 1(e)). Although the
observation of the dewetting evolution by
optical microscopy was reported previously8,
the AFM characterization provides additional
structural information at tens of nanometers,
which is unable to be feasible by OM. For
instance, close scrutiny of the AFM image
(Figure 1(a)) indicates that the irregular tiny
granules are due to excess PS blocks that are
unable to fully cover over a homogenous layer
underneath. Besides, the underneath
continuous layer reveals a few small holes,
indicated by arrows.
To characterize the mesophase-separated
nanostructures of the P(S-b-MMA) films that
dewetted on SiOx/Si after annealing at the
designed temperatures, we performed
GISAXS measurements. The 2D GISAXS
patterns for destabilized films are shown in
Figure 2, which reveals rod-like or spot-like
scattering typical for strongly fiber-textured
films. The rod-like scattering is due to the
elongation of the Bragg diffraction spots
(sharp along q// and slightly diffuse along q)
ascribed to the small thickness of the film. For
the P(S-b-MMA) film annealed at 170 oC, the
GISAXS pattern reveals spots in two sets
symmetrically on either side of the beam stop,
with each set at the same q// having a series of
spots along q. As can be seen in Figure 2,
two brightly striped lines appear parallel to the
q// direction; these striped lines of intense
scattering result from a standing-wave
phenomenon and from total reflection
occurring at the interface between the film and
the substrate9-10. Intersection of the striped
lines with the diffractions of the ordered
nanodomains produces the intense spots. For
the P(S-b-MMA) films annealed at 190 oC, the
spots have increased intensity, accompanied
by broadening of the signals of the spots along
the thickness direction (q). In addition, a
series of Kiessig fringes along the qdirection
emerge for the film annealed at 190 oC. The
amplitude of the Kiessig fringes became
enhanced at 210 and 230 oC. At 245 oC, the
amplitude of the fringes, however, became
depressed. The presence of the Kiessig fringes
associated with resonant diffuse scattering
indicates the presence of a correlated rough
layer.
4. Conclusion
In destabilized thin films of P(S-b-MMA)
induced by thermal annealing, the
mesophase-separated nanodomains were
found to be strongly correlated with the
formation of relief microstructures as a result
of the four stages of dewetting. In the first
stage, the P(S-b-MMA) film ruptures, forming
holes without rims; the nanodomains within
the destabilized film are mainly disordered
micelles. In the second stage, uneven wavy
rims initiate from the rupture, as a result of the
preferential wetting of the PS block by air,

Abstract
The influence of solvent evaporation
processes on well-oriented, perpendicular
cylindrical microdomains of asymmetric
diblock copolymer
polystyrene-b-polyethylene oxide
(PS-b-PEO) thin films was investigated by a
combination of grazing incident small-angle
X-ray scattering (GISAXS) and atomic
force microscopy (AFM). The AFM images
reveal that simply by solvent (toluene)
evaporation and annealing, cylindrical PEO
nanostructures with perpendicular
orientation (oriented normal to the substrate)
were obtained only on the top layer of the
thin films. GISAXS was used to
characterize the thin-film structures on
nanoscopic length scales, thereby providing
in-depth and in-plane nanostructural
information for the thin films. Moreover, the
PEO block preferentially wetting on the
polar hydrophilic hydroxyl surface of a
silicon wafer leads to the parallel orientation
of the PEO cylinders at the substrate
surface.
Introduction
Nanotechnological applications are
frequently dependent on the use of thin
films of the nanostructured materials. In
order to realize these applications, control
over thin-film nanostructures with spatial
and orientational order is paramount. This
requires the uses of external fields, such as
electric fields, graphoepitaxy, crystallization,
controlled interfacial interaction, chemically
patterned substrates, and solvent
evaporation as well as annealing. However,
in thin films, interfacial interactions
(BCP/air and BCP/subtract) and the
confinement effect (film thickness) can both
create more diverse morphologies than the
bulk state. Fundamentally, gaining in depth
understanding of thin-film morphologies
tailored by fine-tuning the film thickness
and by interfacial interactions is essential
knowledge to achieve the structural control
on the molecular levels. Also the properties
of block copolymers could be further
tunable by employing external-stimuli (such
as thermal annealing under solvent
exposure). Advancing over other external
stimuli, simply by the incorporation of small
organic additives in synthetic polymeric
materials and with an external stimulus
(spin coating), nanostructures with well
overall macroscopically spatial order can be
successfully achieved. This is particularly
important for systems like thin films to
manipulate the orientation. The research
project focuses on precise control over
phase behavior and nanostructure size in
thin films of diblock copolymers.

fraction of PS and PEO blocks being
fps=71% and fPMMA=29%, PDI=1.05) was
purchase from Polymer Source, Inc. and
used as received.
Sample preparation
P(S-EO) was dissolved in toluene. Thin
films of P(S-EO) of various thicknesses
were prepared by two methods: spin coating
and drop casting. The film thicknesses were
controlled by changing solution
concentrations and spin rates. Then the films
were subjected to solvent thermal annealing
for 12 hours to increase the microstructural
order in the thin films. The procedure of
sample preparation is depicted in Figure 1

較少的膨潤，此時 PS的體積分率大於原本的
體積分率且 X 值下降，微相結構座落於柱狀
結構區(圖 2-a、b)；隨著甲苯蒸氣下降，乙
醇含量的提高，使得乙醇大量膨潤 PEO鏈段，
此時，PEO鏈段體積分率增加且 X值下降，
相圖剛好落在層板結構(圖 2-c、d)。
在甲苯與丙醇系統之下，丙醇也是親
PEO 鏈段的溶劑，因此，團鏈共聚物的兩鏈
段分別受到兩種溶劑的膨潤，之後由 AFM觀
察表面結構，發現不同於甲苯與乙醇系統所
得到的有序微相結構，而是微胞狀結構。一
開始在高甲苯蒸氣壓底下，雖然甲苯大量膨
潤 PS鏈段，但丙醇對 PEO的χPEO(0.58)小於
乙醇對 PEO 的 χPEO(0.82)，而且丙醇對 PEO
的溶解度(24.6) [9]較接近 PEO 鏈段的溶解度
(21.5) [9]，溶劑大量膨潤薄膜，使得薄膜原本
2wt%濃度被稀釋，造成薄膜呈現流動狀態，
使得原本微相結構受到破壞(圖 3-a)；當丙醇
含量又再增加時，逐漸形成囊微胞結構(圖
3-b)，此時，PEO鏈段被包覆在核內而 PS鏈
段在核外(由於甲苯溶液多於丙醇且 PS 溶於
甲苯)。隨著丙醇溶液增加至 30%，核內的PEO
鏈開始大量膨潤；但核外 PS鏈段不受膨潤，
使得 PS鏈段開始密集堆積，以抵抗丙醇的膨
潤；核內的 PEO鏈段也會受到 PS鏈段壓縮，
丙醇對 PEO鏈段的膨潤程度因而受限，使得
原本的囊狀微胞轉為蟲形柱狀微胞；當丙醇
含量高達 50%時，PS鏈段對 PEO鏈段壓縮更
為嚴重，蟲形柱狀微胞結構逐漸分裂為球型
微胞 (圖 3-e)。這一連續的轉變皆由於丙醇
含量上升，使得 PS 鏈段的密度急遽增加且
PEO 鏈段受到劇烈壓縮，造成界面能上升，
界面曲率也隨之上升，故結構從囊狀、蟲形
柱狀到球狀微胞結構。[7-8]
4. 總結
PS-b-PEO薄膜於兩種不同比例的混合溶
劑控，利用親 PS的溶液(甲苯)與親 PEO的溶
液(乙醇、丙醇)分別膨潤兩種鏈段，並且改變
雙團鏈共聚物的體積分率、XN值。因此，在
高甲苯含量溶劑退火，可獲得有序柱狀結構；
當甲苯含量逐漸減少而乙醇含量逐漸增加時，
微相結構從柱狀結構轉變為層板結構。然而，
在甲苯與丙醇混合溶劑系統下，在高甲苯含
量下及呈現微胞狀結構，隨著丙醇增加，從
囊狀微胞結構轉為柱狀微胞結構，最後變成
球狀微胞結構。這一連續的轉變皆由於親水
性溶劑的增加，使得核外的高分子鏈段自由
能上升，壓縮核內高分子鏈段，造成界面能
上升，微胞形態從囊狀漸轉為曲率較大的球
狀。

Probing relief terraces in destabilized thin films of an asymmetric block copolymer with
grazing-incidence small angle X
NSC 97

1 Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, National Central University,
As the AFM images in Figure 1 show, the
P(S-b-MMA) films of initial thickness 38.4 nm,
which is incommensurate with a stable size for
asymmetric wetting, severely dewetted on
SiOx/Si and PMMA-SiOx/Si to form relief
terraces upon annealing (Fig. 1
whereas the P(S-b-MMA) film of the same
thickness, being commensurate for symmetric
wetting, remained stable on PS-SiOx/Si (Fig.
(c)). Because of the preferential wetting of the
free surface by the PS block, the feature of
nanodomains is clearly observable only at the
edge of terraces on SiOx/Si and
PMMA-SiOx/Si, as shown in the 2 m
AFM height and the phase images. The
corresponding 3D AFM topography reveals the
height of the relief microstructures to be about
38 nm (Fig. 1(d)(e)); this thickness is
appropriate for a single layer of the
P(S-b-MMA) film that comprises one row of
parallel PMMA cylinders embedded within a
PS matrix (shown in the bottom AFM phase
images of Fig 1(a)(b)). The X-ray reflectivity
data indicate that the underlying layer is a
monolayer (thickness 21 nm) of autophobic
P(S-b-MMA) brushes with the PMMA blocks
facing SiOx/Si or PMMA-SiOx/Si but the PS
blocks outward to air. As a result, the
destabilized P(S-b-MMA) films are seen to
have a top layer of unanchored P(S-b
partially wetting with a self-similar species
(namely, a monolayer of anchored
P(S-b-MMA) brushes) at contact angles in a
range 4~6.5o on SiOx/Si and PMMA
(Figs. 1(d)(e)).
To characterize the buried
mesophase-separated nanostructures of the
P(S-b-MMA) films on SiO
PMMA-SiOx/Si and PS-SiOx/Si substrates after
isothermal annealing, we measured GISAXS at
five incident angles (0.1, 0.15, 0.1875, 0.2 and

Furthermore, the two streaks parallel to the

producing diffraction spots. As these spots are
due to the effect of standing waves, the
diffraction intensity of the spots varied with
the incident angle. Another cause of variations
of intensity and of the qposition of the Bragg
spots with grazing angle is a complicated effect
of both reflection and refraction of an X
beam within a film. At small grazing an

q-component diffraction spots is present for
the destabilized P(S-b-MMA) on SiO
PMMA-SiOx/Si but absent from the film on
PS-SiOx/Si. At angles near αcSi or above (α

films on the substrates of three kinds almost
exhibit a similar feature of the q
diffraction spots, indicative of the same
orientation and mesophase
nanodomains.

Effects of film instability on roughness thickness and nanodomain ordering in ultrathin films

2. National Synchrotron Radiation
We carried out the GISAXS measurements
characterize the micro-phase-separated
nanostructures of the P(S-b-MMA) films that
dewetted on top of the SiOx/Si after nonisothermal
annealing. The 2D GISAXS diffraction patterns for
the destabilized films are shown in Figure 1, which
reveals rod-like or spot-like scattering typical for
strongly fiber textured films. No GISAXS patterns
reveal a ring-like scattering as a result from a
random orientation of the nanodomains
anisotropy in the GISAXS patterns indicates that
the nanodomains of the P(S-b-MMA) film
on SiOx/Si, PMMA-SiOx/Si and PS-SiOx
highly oriented with respect to the surface normal
To detect the formation of nanodomains, we
implemented the in-plane and off-detector scan cuts
on the 2D GISAXS patterns to show the 1D
scattering profiles. Figure 2 (in-plane scan cuts) and
3 (off-detector scan cuts) reveal the 1D GISAXS
profiles for the same P(S-b-MMA) films of varied
thickness on SiOx/Si, PMMA-SiOx/Si and
PS-SiOx/Si after annealing. As can be seen in
Figure 2, the P(S-b-MMA) thin films on SiO
and PMMA-SiOx/Si reveal a Bragg peak. Such a
Bragg peak for the P(S-b-MMA) films on SiO
and PMMA-SiOx/Si presents an invariant in the
position irrespective of the initial thickness. Based
on the reflection position, we speculate that the
nanostructures formed in the P(S-b-MMA) films
have a parallely oriented cylindrical structure. In
contrast, the P(S-b-MMA) thin films on top of PS
brush reveal the in-plane diffraction peak with small
intensity and broadening, indicative of a poor
ordering of nanodomains within the P(S-
films. The poor ordering results from increased
stretching of the polymer chains, made evident by a
shift in the diffraction position to smaller qxy

thickness of films reveal a decreasing scattering
amplitude. The first signal exhibits varied positions
with various topographic morphologies; explicitly,
the peak locates at small qz for films having either
droplets or drops, and at large
holes. In contrast, the second peak shows an
independence of dewetting morphologies.
Furthermore, the decreasing amplitude of the
resonant diffuse scattering of the modulations with
increasing qxy indicates a loss of roughness
correlation on smaller in-plane length scales.
