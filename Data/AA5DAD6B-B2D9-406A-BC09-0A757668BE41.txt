  
describe the practical problem of the tracking of a de-
sired trajectory for a three-wheeled mobile robot. In 
Section 3, the trajectory planning problem can be con-
verted into a constrained optimization problem, the con-
trol points of B-spline curve can be solved by means of 
constrained optimization algorithm. We use the fuzzy 
logic system to design the compensated value of privi-
leged velocities and the adaptive MIMO FCMAC is 
developed for the dynamical equation. Simulation ex-
amples are presented in Section 4. Finally, we conclude 
in Section 5 with some comments on a trajectory track-
ing problem. 
2. Description of Mobile Robots 
2.1 Geometric and Velocity Constraints 
The practical problem to be solved in this project is 
the tracking of a desired trajectory for a three-wheeled 
mobile robot, whose configuration is depicted in Figure 
1. Consider the mobile robot moving on a horizontal 
plane, driven by two actuated wheels whose orientation 
is fixed and supported by a castor wheel whose orienta-
tion is varying, as shown in Fig. 2. The system may be 
modeled by a platform (body p) with mass mp, width w  
and length l , attached by two rolling-without-sliding 
wheels (body 1 & 2) of the same mass mw and radius r. 
The masses of the rim of each wheel and platform are 
denoted by wm′  and pm′ , respectively. Let 2b denote 
the width of the two wheels and rρ be the distance be-
tween the point rQ and the mass center of platform pC .

Fig.2: The configuration of the mobile robot 
The six variables ( , , , , , , 1,  2,  )i i i i i ix y i pθ ψ ϕ θ =  are 
adopted here to describe the configuration of body i, and 
therefore there are in general eighteen variables to be 
specified for the system. However, due to physical con-
straints, the number may be reduced. By the assumption 
that the motion is horizontal, we have (i) z1 = a, (ii) z2 = 
a, (iii) zp = hp. The platform is assumed to be kept hori-
zontal as well so that (iv) 0pϕ =  and (v) 0pψ = , and 
hence the triad { ,  ,  }x y zp p pe e e coincides with
' ' '{ ,  ,  }p p pi j k  
and " " "{ ,  ,  }p p pi j k . If the wheels are properly aligned, the 
camber angles for the wheels vanish, (vi) 1 0ψ = , (vii) 
2 0ψ = , so that " " "{ ,  ,  }i i ii j k coincides with ' ' '{ ,  ,  },i i ii j k  for i 
= 1, 2, respectively. Moreover, if the steering mecha-
nism is set, we impose additional constraints on the 
heading angles: (viii) 1θ 2 ( )θ θ= ≡ ,(ix) 2 pθ θ= . From the 
geometry of the interconnected bodies (Fig. 2), we have 
the last four geometric constraints: 
2 1(x) 2 sin ,  x x b θ= +  
2 1(xi) 2 cos ,y y b θ= −  
1(xii) sin cos ,p rx x b θ ρ θ= + +  
1(xiii) cos sinp ry y b θ ρ θ= − + .  
Finally, the condition that the wheels roll without sliding 
and slipping is realized by the following constraints:

stant). However, Conditions (xiv) and (xv) are not inte-
grated, and hence the system is subject to two non-
holonomic constraints. 
2.2 Equations of Motion for Mobile Robots 
We shall now derive the kinematic equations for 
the system of wheeled mobile robot depicted in Fig. 2. 
As discussed in previous Section, in terms of the gener-
alized coordinate 1[ ]

Consider the following fuzzy logic system: 
: ,i e i e i e i i iR IF d A and B and C THEN v D w Eθ ϑ= = = ∆ = ∆ =  
where Ai, Bi, Ci , Di and Ei are fuzzy sets for ith rule; de 
is the error distance between the current position and the 
desired position; θe is error angle between the current 
and desired heading angle; ϑe denotes the orientation 
angle from the current position to desired position; ∆v 
and ∆w are the compensated values of linear velocity 
and angular velocity of the vertical axis at point Q of the 
rear wheels, respectively. Define the posture error vector 
ξe in body frame, which is a coordinate transformation 
of the difference between desired and current posture in 
inertial frame, which is described in Figure. 4.

 into our antecedent part of fuzzy rules, 
and consequent part of fuzzy rules generate two output 
variables ∆u = [∆v,∆w]. Obviously, from above de-
scription, the magnitude of de is employed to deter-
mine the compensated value of linear velocity ∆v. As 
to the compensated angular velocity ∆w, two variables 
θe and ϑe should take into consideration simultaneously. 
If only consider θe, a desired tracking performance 
cannot be guaranteed for the mobile robot. It may go 
forward parallel along the reference trajectory. If only 
consider ϑe variable, the compensated value ∆w of 
fuzzy inference will have high-frequency switch 
(chattering phenomena) near the reference trajectory.

Now, we specify seven linguistic values PB, PM, 
PS, ZE, NS, NM, and NB, corresponding to "Positive 
Big", "Positive Medium", "Positive Small", "Zero", 
"Negative Small", "Negative Medium", "Negative Big", 
respectively. The membership functions of each lin-
guistic values and range are shown in Figure 5, where 
the triangular and singleton are respectively used to 
describe the antecedent and consequent fuzzy sets. 
Fuzzy logic compensator is rule-based systems 
constructed from a collection of IF-THEN rules, 
which are designed based on human knowledge and 
experiences. We adopt straightforward ideas to con-
stitute inference mechanisms of the compensated lin-
ear velocity ∆v and angular velocity ∆w and we give 
the criterion of tuning rules as follows. 
R1 :  IF ed  is near to zero THEN ∆v is near to zero. 
R2 :  IF eϑ  is big THEN ∆v is near to zero. 
R3 : As eϑ  or eθ  increases gradually, the com-
pensated value ∆v decreases gradually. 
R4:  IF eϑ  is near to zero THEN ∆w is near to zero. 
R5 :  IF ed  is big THEN ∆w is near to zero. 
R6 : As ed  increases gradually, the compensated 
value ∆w decreases gradually. 
R7 :  If ed  is near to zero, the compensated value ∆w  
depend on 
eθ  absolutely. 
The fuzzy rule bases are given as follows. where total 
28 3×  rules are employed to decide the compensated 
values of linear velocity and angular velocity of 
wheeled mobile robots. The defuzzification process 
uses the center of gravity approach.

5. Conclusions 
A new systematic design procedure is developed in 
this project for the trajectory tracking of the mobile ro-
bot. The concept lying behind the methodology is a 
combined application of the path planning techniques 
and trajectory tracking control. The constrained optimi-
zation method can be utilized to determine a unique set 
of control points so that the cubic B-spline curve can to 
pass through given intermediate points with uniform 
knots subject to the kinematic constraints and curvature 
restrictions. Due to the local tuning property of B-spline 
curve, the sharp modification of the trajectory is a very 
flexible and effective. Furthermore, the adaptive track-
ing controller is constructed for the hierarchical model 
based on fuzzy inference methodology. The main ad-
vantages of the proposed controller are its systemic de-
sign procedure and stability analysis. The proposed al-
gorithm, which is used to cope with the parametric un-
certainties and attenuate the effect of external distur-
bances, guarantees the stabilization of the motion to a 
desired configuration. From the simulation results, it is 
concluded that the proposed B-spline trajectory tracking 
strategy achieves the desired tracking performance.
