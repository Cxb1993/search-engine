Despite the effectiveness of previous works, these 
power allocation or relay selection schemes, however, 
are designed specifically for either, but not for 
both of, the commonly used total power constraint or 
individual power constraint. To resolve the above 
problem and to be amenable to asymmetric 
environments, in this project we incorporate am 
appropriate sum power constraint and then employ a GP 
approach to jointly determine the optimum power 
allocated to the source(s) and to the relays under 
the total or the individual power constraint in the 
signal-user and the multi-user AF relay networks. 
W first obtain approximate expressions of the 
received SNR, casting the problems into appropriate 
GP forms according to the constraints considered, and 
then determining the power allocation iteratively via 
the single condensation method. Conducted simulations 
show that the proposed power allocation schemes can 
attain superior performance compared with previous 
works under various constraints in miscellaneous 
scenarios.

計畫緣由與目的 
Cooperative communications, which can 
provide the spatial diversity gains by relaying 
each other’s messages to the destination, are a 
promising transmission technique in wireless 
systems [1]. To accommodate the increasing 
demand for wireless services, the performance of 
a cooperative network can be enhanced by 
selecting an appropriate set of relays or properly 
allocating the power resource based on the 
channel state information (CSI) at the sources or 
at the relays [2]. Miscellaneous relay selection or 
power allocation strategies with different 
considerations have been addressed. For example, 
Bletsas et al. [3] proposed an opportunistic 
relaying scheme based on the channel condition at 
relays to achieve the full diversity gain. Zhao et al. 
[4] addressed a relay selection scheme which 
selected the best relay to maximize the capacity. 
Phan et al. [5] considered a relay power allocation 
scheme by using the effective GP in a multi-user 
AF relay network, where, each user is assisted by 
exactly one relay. 
The optimum solutions of the above approaches 
always result in a strategy that places the power 
available on the best relay while keeping the 
others silent. However, these winner-take-all 
schemes may encounter difficulties in networks 
with power-constrained relays. Also, as observed 
in [6], multiple relay selection schemes can in 
general attain better performance than those 
assisted by one relay. In light of this, Amarasuriya 
et al. [7] proposed a simple output-threshold 
multiple relay selection scheme, which selected a 
prescribed arbitrarily ordered relays such that the 
maximal ratio combined SNR of the relayed paths 
and the direct path exceeds a threshold. Jing et al. 
[8] considered the distributed beamforming to 
maximize the SNR. Zheng et al. [9] proposed a 
complex relay weights optimization that can 
achieve the full diversity with perfect CSI. Also, 
to lower the computational overhead, Chen et al. 
[10] proposed a low-complexity two-stage power 
allocation scheme, which, nevertheless, suffered 
some performance loss. 
Despite their effectiveness, these power 
allocation or relay selection schemes, however, 
are designed specifically for either, but not for 
both of, the commonly used total power constraint 
or individual power constraint. To resolve the 
above problem and to be amenable to asymmetric 
environments, in this project we incorporate am

Proposed Algorithms 
In the following, we develop a number of power 
allocation schemes under a variety of practical 
power constraints. We will begin with the 
single-user, and then followed by the multi-user 
AF relay networks. 
A. Single-user AF Relay Networks 
For a single-user AF relay network, the capacity 
between the source and the destination is given by 
, where the average received 
SNR at the destination can be expressed as [13]

To follow, our objective is to determine the

maximize the capacity by taking the following 
two widespread relaying power constraints into 
consideration, namely the total power constraint 
and the individual power constraint. 
 
First, we maximize the capacity with the total 
relaying power at each relay node being imposed 
by . The problem can be posted as maxRP

where  is the maximum sum power of all 
relays and  is the total transmit power during 
the two phases. Note that the incorporation of the 
constraint in (5b) [4] allows us, according to the 
channel conditions, to leverage appropriate power 
at the source and at the relays to boost the 
performance. Since 
max

Simulations 
The systems considered are the AF relay

Rayleigh fading channels as depicted above,

the single-user AF relay networks under the total

including the equal power allocation (EPA), the 
best relay selection combined with the optimal 
power allocation (OPAS-AF) [4], the relay 
weights optimization [9], the two-stage power 
allocation [10], and the proposed one, are carried 
out for comparison, where the EPA scheme 
allocates the total transmit power equally to the 
source and to all of the relays, i.e.

fading channels from the source to the relays, fσ ,

equal to 1

and 1, respectively. The comparison 
of the capacity versus the total transmit power, 
, with  relay nodes is as shown in Fig. 1, 
from which we can observe that all of the 
algorithms improve as  increases. The EPA 
scheme yields the worst performance as it does 
not conduct any power allocation. OPA S-AF [4] 
requires lower communication overhead, but 
yields slightly better performance, as it employs 
only one relay for assistance. The suboptimal 
two-stage power allocation in [10] reduces the 
computational complexity, but at the price of 
some performance loss. We can also note that the 
proposed power allocation scheme provides the 
best performance, as it takes both the source 
power and the relay sum power into consideration, 
and uses the effective GP to optimize the power 
distribution among the source and the relays.

Abstract—This paper presents a genetic approach for joint
relay subset selection and power allocation in amplify-and-
forward (AF) cooperative networks. To accommodate this joint
consideration, each chromosome in the proposed genetic algo-
rithm (GA), referred to as the hybrid GA (HGA), is divided into
an integer string for relay selection and a bit string for power al-
location. In addition, new crossover and mutation operations are
employed to accommodate these new chromosomes. To alleviate
the complexity when the number of the assisted relays becomes
large, a low-complexity two-stage algorithm is addressed, which
first uses a modified HGA to determine the optimal relay subset
and the power division between the source and the relays, and
then uses convex optimization to refine the power distribution
over all selected relays. Conducted simulations show that the new
GA-based algorithms can attain superior performance compared
with previous works, especially for asymmetric channels.
I. INTRODUCTION
Cooperative communications, which can provide spatial
diversity by relaying each other’s messages to the destination,
are an emerging transmission technique in wireless commu-
nication systems [1], [2]. It is known that the performance
of a cooperative network can be enhanced by selecting an
appropriate set of relays or by optimally allocating the power
resource based on the channel state information.
Miscellaneous power allocation or relay selection strategies
based on different considerations have been addressed for
cooperative networks. For instance, Bletsas et al. [3] pro-
posed an opportunistic relaying scheme based on the channel
condition at relays to achieve the full diversity gain. Zhao
et al. [4] addressed a relay selection scheme which selected
the best relay node to maximize the capacity. As it has
been observed in [5] that using multiple nodes instead of a
single one for relaying can enhance the system performance,
a number of algorithms, suggested for either sensor or relay
selection, can be employed to choose an appropriate subset
of assisted relays. For example, Joshi et al. [6] considered
a sensor selection algorithm via convex optimization. Since
the problem considered involves complicated nonlinear 0-1
programming, [6] suggested a convex relaxation formulation,
followed by some local optimization methods. Also, a GA [7],
originally devised for sensor selection, can be employed for
the determination of optimal subset of relays as well. Jing et
al. [5] proposed a greedy algorithm for relay selection in AF
relay networks and then used the maximal power allowable by
the selected relays for retransmission. Despite its simplicity,
the number of relays employed in [5], however, is adaptive to
the channel conditions and can not be determined beforehand.
It has been found that the system performance can be further
enhanced if the relay selection is combined with the power
allocation. For example, Zhao et al. [4] devised an optimal
power allocation following the best relay selection to achieve
even superior performance. Phan et al. [8] first conducted the
relay subset selection by [6] and then determined the power
allocation by convex optimization [9]. However, since the
relay selection and the power allocation are closely related to
each other, treated separately in previous works, the solutions
of which appear to be suboptimal and inevitably impact the
system performance. Moreover, most of the existing works do
not have a systematic approach to place appropriate power
at the source and at the relays under the total power budget.
This will be an even more challenging issue for asymmetric
channels, where the distance from the relays to the sources
is different from that to the destination. An optimal power
division was derived in [4], but it was only applicable to the
single-assisted-relay scenario.
To resolve the above setback, this paper presents a genetic
approach for joint relay subset selection and power allocation
in AF cooperative networks. GA is an effective optimization
technique that emulates the crossover and mutation phases
in the evolution of a chromosome to efficaciously search the
optimal solution [10]. It has been applied successfully in var-
ious disciplines of applications, such as signal processing and
wireless communications [11]. Compared to the conventional
GA [10] or the previously addressed GA [7], the proposed
GA, referred to as HGA, possesses two distinctive features: 1)
each chromosome is comprised of not only an integer string
for relay selection, but also a bit string for power allocation to
accommodate the joint consideration, and 2) the genes in the
relay selection part are a permutation of the relay indices, thus
avoiding the dilemma when they have the same values in the
evolution process and some of them need to be discarded to
meet the prescribed target. Also, new crossover and mutation
operations are employed to accommodate these new chro-
mosomes. In addition, to alleviate the complexity when the
number of the assisted relays becomes large, which requires a
larger population size and/or generations for HGA to converge,
a low-complexity two-stage algorithm is also addressed, which
operation and the mutation operation. Next, we describe the
steps of the proposed HGA in which every solution is repre-
sented by a chromosome and the capacity in (4a) is taken as
our fitness function.
Step 0: (Initialization)
The algorithm begins with creating P parent chromosomes,
where P is the population size. The relay selection part com-
prises L genes which are a random permutation of {1, . . . , L};
whereas, the power allocation part comprises (M+1)B genes
which are uniformly distributed in 1 or 0, where B is the
length of the bit string for both PS and {PRj}Mj=1. Note that
in the relay selection part, the genes with a larger value denote
a higher selection priority. For example, {1,3} relays will be
selected if M = 2 in Fig. 1 (a).
Step 1: (Evaluation)
In each generation, the fitness values are computed for
each of the P chromosomes of the current population by
substituting the allocated power PS and {PRj}Mj=1 and the
new relay selection indicators {αRj}Lj=1 into the capacity in
(4a). We also normalize PS and {PRj}Mj=1 to ensure that they
satisfy the constraints in (4d).
Step 2: (Selection)
In order to preserve better chromosomes (solutions) to yield
better offsprings, we employ the truncated selection scheme
[10] which only retains R parent chromosomes that have
higher fitness values. We then reproduce them in a mating
pool and randomly select two parent chromosomes for the
following crossover step.
Step 3: (Hybrid Crossover)
The crossover between the two selected chromosomes is
divided into two operations: the priority crossover for the
relay selection part and the conventional crossover [10] for
the power allocation part. The former involves two steps:
exchange-empty and sorting-refilling.
The exchange-empty step begins by constructing an (L +
(M + 1)B) × 1 crossover mask sequence consisting of 1’s
and 0’s generated with equal probability [10]. When the
elements in the crossover mask are 1’s, the genes of the
two parent chromosomes in the corresponding positions will
be exchanged. However, if they are 0’s, the genes in the
relay selection part will be emptied, but those in the power
allocation part will remain unchanged as in the conventional
crossover operation. The crossover operation in the power
allocation part, which is the same as that in the conven-
tional GA, is based on the uniform crossover operation. For
example, the parent chromosomes a and b, along with the
mask [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0], will produce
the offspring chromosomes a’ and b’ as shown in Fig. 2. Note
that the crossover operation in the power allocation part ceases
at this point and only the relay selection part is required for
the subsequent sorting-refilling step.
In the sort-refill step, we refill the missing gene values
sequentially in a descending order in the relay selection part
of the chromosomes, beginning with genes of larger integer

Fig. 2. Illustration of the hybrid crossover and hybrid mutation operations
in the HGA, where L = 5, M = 2, and B=4
values before the aforementioned exchange-empty step. Also,
the genes filled in are those integers which do not appear after
the exchange-empty step. Such a refill process ensures that
genes with larger values (higher priority) still possess larger
ones after the crossover, reflecting the fitness-survival principle
of the GA [10]. For example, the values of the first and the
fourth genes are missing in the relay selection part of the
offspring a’, as shown in Fig. 2. Since the first and the fourth
genes of parent a are originally with values 2 and 4, we thus
fill in 1 and 2 in offspring a’, respectively, as they do not
appear after the exchange-empty step. Likewise, we will fill
in the first and fourth genes at the relay selection part of the
offspring b’ with 2 and 4, respectively. Note that based on this
new crossover, the genes at the relay selection part will always
contain a permutation of {1, . . . , L}, so the relay selection can
be easily made. This hybrid crossover operation will repeat
until the size of the new population is the same as P .
Step 4: (Hybrid Mutation)
The hybrid mutation operation is also divided into two
operations: the priority mutation for the relay selection part
and the conventional mutation for the power allocation part.
First, for each chromosome, we create a (1 + (M +1)B)× 1
mutation mask sequence comprising 1’s and 0’s generated
according to the mutation probability pm [10]. If the first
element of the mask is 1, two randomly selected gene values in
the relay selection part of the chromosome will be exchanged.
This ensures that the genes in the relay selection part are still
a permutation of {1, . . . , L}. However, if the first element is

Fig. 4. Comparison of the capacity versus different total transmit power in
single-user AF networks, where L = 10 and M = 3
destination node are deployed randomly and then fixed in a
rectangular area inside the box area [(0m, 0m), (5m, 20m)]
and [(35m, 0m), (40m, 20m)], respectively. Assume that there
are L=10 relay nodes located at (30m, 2 + 2(j − 1)m),
j = 1, . . . , L, where the relays are closer to the destination
nodes, and that M=3 relays are employed for assistance. The
noise power is NRj = NDi = 10−5, ∀i, j.
First, we evaluate the convergence behavior of the pro-
posed HGA approach. The average system capacity versus the
number of generations for the proposed HGA with optimal
power allocation (HGA(opt)) and the two-stage implementa-
tion (HGA(two-stage)) when the total the total transmit power
PT = 100W are as shown in Figs. 3 (a) and (b), respectively.
As expected, the capacity of HGA(opt) and HGA(two-stage)
improves as the number of generations, G, or the size of the
population, P , increases. We can notice that the capacity re-
mains the same when P ≥ 100 or when G ≥ 13 for HGA(opt);
whereas, the capacity is about the same for HGA(two-stage)
when G ≥ 7 or when P ≥ 50. Therefore, in the following
simulations, we use P = 100 and G = 13, and P = 50 and
G = 7 in HGA(opt) and HGA(two-stage), respectively.
Next, we compare the capacity versus the total transmit
power, PT , for the AF networks, as shown in Fig. 4, where six
algorithms are carried out for comparison, including the best
relay selection combined with the optimal power allocation
(OPA S-AF) [4], the convex relay selection in [6] with relaying
power being equally allocated to all relays (CVX-EPA), the
convex relay selection along with convex optimization-based
power allocation (CVX-CVX) in [8], the GA-based relay se-
lection [7] with equal power allocation (GA-EPA), and the pro-
posed HGA(opt) and the two-stage implementation HGA(two-
stage). The convex optimization involved is implemented via
CVX in [13]. We can note from Fig. 4 that the performance
of all algorithms, as expected, improves as PT increases and
that OPA S-AF yields the worst performance, as it employs
only one relay for assistance. Also, the proposed HGAs yield
superior performance compared with previous works. This is
due to the fact that HGAs take the relay selection and the
power allocation at the same time. Although the two-stage
algorithm is only suboptimal, its performance is very close to
the optimal solution.
As for the computational complexity, the GA approach
requires to compute the capacity PG times; whereas the
convex optimization approach needs O(N3), where N is
the number of parameters involved in the optimization pro-
cess. Therefore, HGA(opt) needs to determine the capacity
1300 times; whereas, HGA(two-stage) requires to compute
the capacity roughly 350 times, where the complexity called
for by the convex optimization is negligible compared to
the GA evolution process. Therefore, HGA(two-stage), while
attaining roughly the same performance as HGA(opt), requires
substantially reduced complexity compared with the latter.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have developed a new GA, called HGA,
for simultaneously selecting the relay subset and power al-
location in AF relay networks. Furthermore, to reduce the
computational overhead when there are lots of relays, a low-
complexity two-stage algorithm is also addressed, which first
uses a modified HGA to determine the optimal relay subset and
the power division, and followed by refined power distribution
over all selected relays by convex optimization. The results of
simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach
in finding an optimal solution.
