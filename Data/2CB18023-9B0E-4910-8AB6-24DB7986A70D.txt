based on radio and infrared transmission 
mechanisms, and utilizing such technologies 
as cellular telephony, personal 
communications systems, and wireless local 
area networks. These systems have the 
potential to dramatically change society. 
That is, in the near future, many personal 
electronic devices will be able to 
communicate with each other over a 
short-range wireless channel. Therefore, 
distributed, self- organizing systems are the 
next challenge in IT. A sensor network is 
one of the most important examples of these 
systems. A sensor is a typical example of a 
lightweight computing device. Lightweight 
computing devices are devices that are 
resource-poor. Other important lightweight 
computing devices include RFIDs and 
smartcards. The common characteristics of 
these devices are: low-power CPU, small 
memory, and limited battery power. 
There are still many obstacles before we can 
proceed. Security is a major concern as we 
need to be sure that the data we receive is 
authentic and confidential, and have not 
been tampered with. This is especially 
difficult because lightweight computing 
devices have very limited resources and we 
cannot guarantee physical security of these 
devices. It raises fundamental questions and 
challenging technology issues.  
In the 1980s, many of the basic tools in 
cryptography were rigorously defined and 
constructed based on number theoretic 
assumptions, including public-key 
encryption as well as pseudo-random 
generators, pseudorandom functions, block 
ciphers, and signature schemes. Most of 
them are based on hard problems from 
number theory, algebra, and algebraic 
geometry (elliptic curves over finite fields). 
However, due to the unique characteristic of 
lightweight computing devices, new 
approaches to design cryptographic 
primitives are required.  
In this research project, we focused on the 
following cryptographic primitives: 
Hash/MAC, Encryption, Random number 
generator, and Secret sharing. We first 
examined closely the characteristics of 
lightweight computing devices. Then we 
designed secure and efficient cryptographic 
primitives. Finally, We evaluated the 
feasibility of new mechanisms and try to 
apply them in some application scenarios.  
Our major contributions are the followings: 
 We proposed a variant of the GGM 
construction of pseudorandom 
functions and a RFID protocol to 
protect against cloning attacks and 
malicious tracing based on 
pseudorandom functions.  
 We proposed a refinement to 
Miller's algorithm for computing 
Weil/Tate Pairings. 
 We proposed a distributed, reliable 
and low- power -consumed key- 
renewal scheme for wireless sensor 
networks.

4-ary-tree variant construction can 
achieve the best performance under 
the assumption that the underlying 
pseudorandom generators generate 
pseudorandom bits sequentially. 
We also propose a RFID protocol to 
protect against cloning attacks and 
malicious tracing for identifying 
merchandise based on 
pseudorandom functions [1,2,3].  
 We propose a refinement to Miller's 
algorithm for computing Weil/Tate 
Pairings and show that it has better 
performance than the original 
algorithms. [4]. 
 We propose a distributed, reliable 
and low- power -consumed key- 
renewal scheme for wireless sensor 
networks. [5,6]

Cryptographic primitive research comprises 
much of the body of modern cryptographic 
research. This kind of research aims to 
produce useful primitives building blocks 
with which we can design systems to enforce 
complex and subtle security requirements. 
There are many research projects related to 
lightweight devices. However, most of them 
are application oriented.

Overview of TEA and Related 
Ciphers (27th Feb 2004 - Draft v0.3) 
The Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) 
and related variants (XTEA, Block 
TEA, XXTEA) are block ciphers 
notable for their simplicity of 
description and implementation 
(typically a few lines of code), and 
consequently enjoy a measure of 
popularity. This article provides an 
overview of these ciphers together 
with known cryptanalytic results and 
some garish illustrations. It 
concludes with some musings on the 
design goal of `tinyness'.

The performance measurement of 
cryptographic primitives on palm 
devices, Proceedings 17th Annual 
Computer Security Applications 
Conference, pp. 92- 101, 2001. 
The authors developed and evaluated 
several cryptographic system libraries for 
Palm OS(R) which include stream and 
block ciphers, hash functions and 
multiple-precision integer arithmetic 
operations. It is noted that the optimized 
Rijndael with 8KB of lookup tables is 4 
times faster than DES. In addition, the 
results show that implementing the 
cryptographic algorithms as system 
libraries does not degrade their 
performance significantly. Instead, they 
provide great flexibility and code 
management to the algorithms. 
Furthermore, the test results presented 
provide a basis for performance 
estimation of cryptosystems 
implemented on the PalmPilot.

PANA/GSM authentication for 
Internet access, Joint First Workshop

Trends in Communications, 
SympoTIC '03, pp. 146 – 152, 2003.  
Currently, there are no Internet access 
authentication protocols available that 
are lightweight, can be carried over 
arbitrary access networks, and are 
flexible enough to be used in all the 
likely future ubiquitous mobility access 
contexts. The IETF PANA (Protocol for 
carrying Authentication for Network 
Access) work aims to provide a protocol 
that will be a network-layer 
authentication carrier for access 
networks that support IP. This article 
proposes a PANA/GSM authentication 
protocol for heterogeneous network 
access as a step towards filling this gap. 
A security analysis of the PANA/GSM 
protocol is also provided.

LHAP: a lightweight hop-by-hop 
authentication protocol for ad-hoc 
networks, in Proceedings Workshops 
on Distributed Computing Systems , 
pp. 749-755, 2003.   
Most ad hoc networks do not 
implement any network access 
control, leaving these networks 
vulnerable to resource consumption 
attacks where a malicious node 
injects packets into the network with 
the goal of depleting the resources of 
the nodes relaying the packets. To 
thwart or prevent such attacks, it is 
necessary to employ authentication 
mechanisms that ensure that only 
authorized nodes can inject traffic 
into the network. This article 
presents LHAP, a scalable and 
light-weight authentication protocol 
for ad hoc networks.

The IEEE 802.11 wireless standard 
provides little support for secure 
access control. As a result, access 
control in IEEE 802.11 on a per 
packet basis requires a new and 
robust identity authentication 
protocol. The SOLA (Statistical 
One-Bit Lightweight Authentication) 
protocol is well suited in a wireless
