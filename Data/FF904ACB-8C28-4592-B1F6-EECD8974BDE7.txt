ABSTRACT 
Within the framework of the present study, extensive two- and three-dimensional simulations of Reynolds 
averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and experimental measurements using PIV/BIV (particle/bubble image 
velocimitry) were performed in order to gain significant insight into various complex flow phenomena surrounding 
an artificial reef owing to its interaction with an oncoming wave. Nonlinear effects in the nearfield of the structures 
such as vortex formation, turbulence and wave breaking were intended to be investigated. In the numerical modeling, 
the transient evolution of the free-surface is opted to be captured by the higher order weighted essentially 
non-oscillatory schemes. Capillary effects is taken into account, so as to include concentrated nonisotropic stresses 
near the interface. Results concerning time evolutions of the velocity field were extracted for short waves, revealing 
how an initial steep wave undergoes breaking and successive splash-up cycles. Breaking processes, including 
overturning, splash-up and air entrainment, and breaking induced vortex-like motion and the associated energy 
dissipation were also investigated.

1. Introduction 
Artificial reefs are man-made structures that serve 
as a shelter and habitat, sources of food, breeding 
areas, and shoreline protection. In analogy to the 
biological diversity at natural reefs and their effect on 
the wave transformations, artificial reefs are being 
more often considered in coastal engineering design 
applications where natural and environmentally 
sensitive solutions to shoreline protection problems

and maintaining coastal zone environment. In that 
sense an in depth understanding of the mechanism of 
wave transformation (leading to turbulence) and 
breaking over artificial reefs is expected to 
significantly enhance our knowledge concerning the 
governing flow physics. Moreover, till today there 
exist very few reliable experimental and simulated 
(three-dimensional in particular) findings on the 
subject. On the other hand, we may mention here that 
most of the existing theoretical investigations on the 
topic are conducted either based on the potential flow 
theory or by using depth integrated equations, such as 
shallow-water equations, Boussinesq equation, or 
Serre equation (e.g. Zelt, 1991, Karambas and 
Koutitas, 1992, Schaffer, et al., 1993). However, the 
depth integrated equations are unlikely to produce 
accurate solutions for the velocity field. Moreover, 
these models lack the capability to determine spatial 
distributions of the turbulent kinetic energy. On the 
other hand, with the advent of faster computers and 
gradual improvement of CPU speed, the attention has 
gradually shifted towards numerically solving the 
entire flow field, including the complex phenomenon 
like wave breaking. Notably, owing to flow separation, 
turbulent intensity is greatly enhanced in the vicinity 
of a structure. Again, this is especially true for a 
porous coastal structure. The enhanced turbulence will 
in turn make significant impacts on wave force, on the 
scouring process at the toe of the structure, and on the 
overall mixing enhancement. We may mention here 
that, most of the existing experimental studies 
concerning wave-structure interaction mainly focus on 
the estimation of wave reflection and transmission; 
however, detailed pressure and velocity measurements 
are indispensable for a better understanding of the 
physical process. Such measurements are also 
essential for developing/validating effective 
mathematical/numerical models. 
Moreover, breaking waves over artificial reef 
serve to restrict the height of the surface waves, and 
enhance air-sea fluxes of heat, mass and momentum 
through the generation of turbulence and air 
entrainment, and usually occurs due to intrinsic 
instabilities of water waves or interactions through 
wave-structure, wave-wave, wave-current and 
wind-wave. In addition, breaking waves exert the 
largest wave-induced force on offshore structures in 
heavy seas, which cause serious safety problems and 
structural damage. Therefore, it is of great importance 
to understand the mechanisms leading to the breaking 
processes. 
Breaking is characterized by “white water’’ 
falling down the front face of the wave. The plunging 
breakers (Bonmarin, 1989; Rapp and Melville, 1990) 
are characterized by a steepening and overturning of 
the front face and the formation of a jet that plunges 
into the water ahead of the wave. For the spilling 
breakers (see Banner and Meliville, 1976; Duncan, 
1981) the wave shape as a whole remains more or less 
symmetric. Breaking is visible by the appearance of 
aerated water near the top of the wave, which 
subsequently spreads down over the front face. The 
distinction between plunging and spilling breakers 
refers to the phase of initial breaking. Farther inshore, 
both types gradually develop into a turbulent bore, of 
which properties are mainly controlled by the local 
depth. As these bores approach the coastline, they 
collapse, and the motion continues in the form of a 
thin sheet of water rushing up the slope to the point of 
maximum run-up, and then break again. 
Flow visualization shows that at large crest 
curvatures a toe is formed on the forward face of the 
wave. At higher curvature near the toe, the disturbance 
rapidly leads to the generation of parasitic capillaries, 
which grow and evolve into a turbulent spilling region 
on the forward face of the wave. Longuet-Higgins and 
Cleaver (1994) have found that the formation of the 
initial toe is similar to an inviscid irrotational 
instability of the highest wave. The large curvature at 
the tip of the toe along with free boundary conditions 
lead to the generation of vorticity associated with 
5 
 
velocimetry (BIV) techniques, respectively. The PIV 
system used in the present study includes a dual-head 
pulsed laser, laser light sheet optics, a CCD camera, 
and a synchronizer. The illumination source is a 
dual-head Nd:YAG pulsed laser that has a 20 Hz 
repetition rate and 120 mJ/pulse maximum energy 
output. Images were recorded using a 12-bit CCD 
camera that has a 1600×1200 pixel resolution and 30 
frames per second (fps) maximum framing rate. The 
BIV system used in this study includes 4sets of 
500Watt halogen lamps, a high speed CCD camera. 
The shadowgraphy images of breaker bubbles were 
recorded using a high speed camera that has a 128×
1024 pixel resolution and 1000 frames per second 
(fps). A definition sketch of the PIV and BIV 
experimental setup are shown in Figs. 3 and 4, 
respectively.

The maximum scan rate of the analog input was 
200kS/s for multichannel inputs, and 10 kS/s for the 
two 16-bit analog outputs. A differential mode was 
used for analog measurements to reduce the 
background electric noise. In particular, 24-bit 20 
MHz counters were synchronized with the DAQ board 
to generate highly accurate and synchronized TTL 
triggers to control the CCD, pulsed laser, or other 
instruments. 
2.2 Numerical Implementation 
The physical problem considered in this study is 
the propagation of a two-dimensional periodic wave 
train traveling toward the bar/step-type profile and the 
varying topography. The Reynolds decomposition 
method is applied to separate the mean quantities and 
turbulent fluctuations. As a result, the governing 
equations which describe the mean quantities of the 
flow field for unsteady incompressible turbulent flows 
are denoted as

An explicit computational scheme was used to 
evaluate the temporal terms in the momentum 
equations, while the coupling between pressure and 
velocities was implicit. The semi-implicit formulation 
was then solved with successive over-relaxation to 
accelerate convergence. In the computational 
algorithm, a prediction and correction scheme was 
adopted. It should be noted that the advancing time 
step is adjusted to satisfy the 
Courant-Friedricks-Lewey (CFL) stability criterion. 
The solution then marched in time using the iterative 
correction of the velocity field through the implicit 
continuity equation which is equivalent to the Poisson 
equation of pressure. The adjustment of pressure and 
velocity by this iterative process ensures mass 
conservation in each cell. The iterative process in each 
time step was repeated until continuity divergence 
value D for all cells less than 10-4.  
An appropriate way of predicting a free surface is 
important in the wave breaking problem. The Volume 
of Fluid (VOF) method proposed by Hirt and Nichols 
(1981) is adopted in this study to predict free surface 
variations. The main principle of VOF is established 
according to the material transport conservation theory. 
Based on this theory, we can define a variable, called 
the VOF function F(x, z, t), which represents the 
fractional volume of fluid occupied at each cell and 
the mechanism can be described by the following 
formula. 
0F F FU W
t x z
∂ ∂ ∂+ + =∂ ∂ ∂
 (10) 
The variable F ranging from 0 to 1 is also defined 
at the center of a computational cell. That is, the 
computational cells can be divided into three kinds. A 
cell full of fluid is called a fluid cell and has the value 
of 1. On the other hand, if a cell does not contain any 
fluid, it will be called an empty cell and has zero value. 
Lastly, cells that are partially filled with fluid are 
called surface cells and have the values between 0 and 
1. To solve Eq. (10), Hirt and Nichols (1981) derived 
the donor-acceptor method. Depending on the 
direction of the velocity components, the upstream and 
downstream cells act as donor and acceptor 
respectively. Thus, through the material transport 
processes, the fluid volume conservation is preserved. 
The embedding method is proposed by Ravoux et 
al. (2003). The embedding method refers to a scheme 
for flows in the vicinity of stationary or moving solid 
bodies using a space-filling Cartesian grid that passes 
through the solid bodies as well. The governing 
equations for fluid flow are solved everywhere, 
including the cells which are occupied by the solid 
body. The presence of the solid body is accounted for, 
however, by adding a force field to the momentum 
equations in those cells that are fully or partially 
occupied by the solid phase. The magnitude and 
direction of this body force density is determined at 
each time step by requiring the value of the velocity in 
those cells to match the prescribed velocity of the solid 
body. This is done with the aid of a volume-fraction 
field that determines what fraction of each 
computational cell in the Cartesian grid is occupied by 
the solid phase. In cells where the solid volume 
fraction is unity, the velocity is set exactly equal to 
that of the body, and in those where the volume 
fraction is between zero and one, the velocity is only 
adjusted partially, in proportion to the volume fraction. 
Cells which are from the solid and have a volume 
fraction of zero do not possess this body-force and are 
not affected in that step of the computation. 
3. Results and discusoins 
Numerical simulation results of mean flow field 
and turbulent transport mechanism under wave 
breaking on bar/step-type beach profiles using the 
present model are provided. Interesting issues are the 
horizontal vortices formed in a breaking wave, 
turbulent kinetic intensity, turbulent dissipation and 
eddy viscosity. Four snapshots at different wave 
phases, i.e. t/T = 0, 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75, are shown in 
the spatial domain to give a precise description of

Fig. 7 presents the simulated mean velocity field 
for the step-type profile case. Comparing with results 
from the bar-type profile, it is found that the flow 
structure after wave breaking is uniform through the 
whole flow domain. Experimental flow fields for wave 
breaking on step-type profile at different wave phases 
are shown in Fig. 8. It is found that flow ejection is 
initiated at the breaking and the fastest velocity is 
occurring at face front of the breaker bubble area. 
Then the bubble flow velocity decrease due to the 
viscosity on the propagating process.

Fig. 11 illustrates the simulated horizontal vorticity in 
the stepped beach profile case. It is found that vorticity 
is first generated at a shallow water region and reaches 
its maximum value at the breaking point, finally 
covers a larger region in the surf zone. Experimental 
vorticity fields for wave breaking on step-type profile 
at different wave phases are shown in Fig. 12. It is 
found that vorticity is first occurred while breaking 
waves approach a shallow water region and reaches its 
maximum value at the breaking point in the breaker 
bubble area.  Then the magnitude of vorticity extends 
to disappear with the propagation of breaker bubble 
area.

Fig. 15 shows that the turbulent intensity extends to 
appear between two crest regions and continues into 
the surf zone in the second breaking. The turbulent 
intensity is generated just before the breaking point 
and is higher in the roller region and forward face of 
the wave. It should be noted that the turbulent 
intensity is then convected and diffused to the back 
face of the wave, remaining a considerable amount as 
the wave moves into the surf zone. Experimental 
results of turbulent kinetic energy fields for wave 
breaking on step-type profile at different wave phases 
are shown in Fig. 16. It is clear that the TKE have its 
maximum value in front of the breaker face and the 
TKE under breaking wave is then convected and 
diffused to the back face of the wave.

dissipation takes place above the wave trough and at 
the wavefront, with no turbulent dissipation under the 
wave crest. The turbulent dissipation displays a long 
tail at the back face of the wave when the wave 
approaches the shore. The experimental results of 
turbulent dissipation fields for wave breaking on 
bar/step-type profile at different wave phases are 
shown in Figs. 18 and 20.

surf zone by directly solving Reynolds averaged
