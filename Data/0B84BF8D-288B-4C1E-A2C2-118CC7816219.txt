know the functions f and G, (15) can not be realized to 
achieve the desired characteristic of (17). We aim to de-

ideal controller (15). To achieve this purpose, construct a 
fuzzy CMAC as

V. Conclusions 
 This project, an adaptive fuzzy CMAC for MIMO 
system has introduced. The developed controller is ap-
plied to control a two-link robot manipulator. Adaptation 
mechanisms are established for adjusting the weighting 
parameters of fuzzy CMAC to estimate the unknown 
system functions such that an estimated ideal controller 
can be constructed. The remainder one, compensated 
controller, is employed to attenuate the model approxi-
mation error, including the function approximation error 
and ideal controller approximation error. Besides, for re-
ducing the number of input variables, we integrate these 
state variables into only one variable. Therefore this 
achieves a simplified fuzzy CMAC. Obviously, it can be 
easily implemented in high-dimensional systems and less 
computational load than that of conventional CMAC. 
This project also shows that the proposed control scheme 
is able to cope with system uncertainties with no prelimi-
nary off-line learning phase required. Computer simula-
tion results for robot manipulator example have shown 
the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy CMAC.
