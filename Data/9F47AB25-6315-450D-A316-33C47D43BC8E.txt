define the white, gray and black spreading codes to 
facilitate the management of spreading code 
resources. Properly allocating the white and gray 
spreading codes but the black ones can achieve a 
higher spectrum efficiency without harming the 
macrocell users. For the purpose of evaluating the 
candidacy of the gray spreading codes, a 
sophisticated interference analysis is conducted so 
as to define a new 
multiple access interference (MAI) coefficient to 
quantize the amount of interference imposed on a 
microcell user. With the help of the new MAI 
coefficient, a less interfered white or gray 
spreading code can be assigned to microcell users, 
which can bring about an extra 55 of call admissions 
in one of our considered case. Moreover, the 
capability of the proposed hierarchical system 
architecture as well as the interference management 
scheme for developing the femtocell system has also 
been proved via the simulation results with a large 
number of femtocells. It is believed that cooperating 
with the substream deactivation technique, the 
proposed spreading code management associated with 
the hierarchical system  architecture can be a 
potential prototype of the CR-based femtocell system.

近年來以 MC-CDMA 為基礎的相關傳輸技術在寬頻無線通訊系統中受到廣泛的注目。 無論
是在傳統或是目前新興的感知無線電 (CR: cognitive radio) 系統中, 結合平面架構的 MC-
CDMA 系統已在許多文獻中多方面且深入的討論。 本研究計畫將討論的重點由平面式結構
轉移到基於二維展頻MC-DS-CDMA 的階層式架構。 在這樣的系統架構之中,小細胞被嵌置
於原始的大細胞之內。 然而, 這樣的階層式架構易在大細胞和小細胞之間引起嚴重的干擾。 因
此本計劃的主要目的在發展一干擾避免 (interference avoidance ,IA) 碼分配的策略, 以有效
的消減這一類下行鏈路的跨細胞干擾。
為此, 我們定義了白色、 灰色以及黑色展頻碼, 以便於管理展頻碼資源。 除了黑色的展頻
碼之外, 正確的分配白色與灰色展頻碼將能在不損及大細胞使用者的情況下達到更高的頻譜
效益。 我們透過複雜的干擾分析評估灰色展頻碼的候選資格, 以進一步定義一個新的多重存
取干擾 (MAI: multiple access interference) 係數, 並使其成為小細胞使用者的干擾量化指
標。 藉由新的 MAI 系數的幫助, 可將干擾量較少的白色及灰色展頻碼配置給小細胞使用者。
我們相信結合子串流卸除 (substream deactivation) 技術將使得本計劃所發展之階級式系統
架構及其展頻碼管理方法成為一個極具發展潛力的感知無線電毫微細胞系統的雛型。

minimized signature waveform [10], the interference-rejection [11] and interference-free
[12] spreading codes were proposed for the multi-carrier direct-sequenced CDMA (MC-
DS-CDMA) systems. In addition, some code assignment and management strategies
based on the dual quasi-orthogonal, Walsh codes and two-dimensional(2D) spreading
codes were also developed to reduce the amount of MAI [15–21]. To further enhance the
system performance, a low-complexity multiuser detection (MUD) scheme and so-called
steered space-time spreading by using smart antennas were proposed in [13] and [14],
respectively.
Recently, the authors in [22] suggested the MC-CDMA technology for the CR ap-
plications. Also, in [23], the authors summarized some important research topics for
the CR systems and suggested the MC-CDMA and MC-DS-CDMA to be the associ-
ated transmission technologies. The MC-CDMA with subcarrier deactivation on the
CR receiving end, i.e. the so-called non-continuous MC-CDMA (NC-MC-CDMA), was
also recommended for the CR systems [24,25]. In [26], another kind of NC-MC-CDMA
named the non-continuous carrier interferometry MC-CDMA (NC-CI/MC-CDMA) was
proposed to solve the non-orthogonality problem of the spreading codes by using the
orthogonal CI codes with ﬂexible lengths. In addition to the length of spreading codes,
the authors in [27] jointly adjusted the spreading sequence, chip duration and trans-
mission power according to the variable number of available sub-bands and bandwidth.
In [28], a multi-user resource allocation was proposed for the CR-based mobile Ad Hoc
networks in the MC-DS-CDMA system. In [29], several low-complexity, high-ﬂexibility
and robust multi-user detection (MUD) schemes were proposed for the CR systems
based on MC-DS-CDMA, including the zero-forcing, minimum mean-square error and
interference cancellation techniques.

termeasure for the downlink transmissions [33]. In the OFDMA-based femtocell sys-
tems, however, many techniques have been proposed to eliminate the cross-tier inter-
ference for both uplink and downlink, including the subchannel allocation and power
control mechanism [34–38], spectrum allocation [39–41], multiple antennas and beam-
forming techniques [42–45], interference avoidance and coordination [46, 47] and frac-
tional frequency reuse scheme [48, 49].
In order to facilitate the management of spreading code resources, the white, gray
and black spreading codes can be deﬁned (in Sec. II.(B)) by referring to the concept
of the spectrum wholes in [50], of which white is equivalent to interference-free in terms
of the macrocll users; while gray and black mean interference-related. Borrowing the
concept from the femtocell system, it is not allowed to produce excessive interference
to the primitive macrocell system while embedding a new microcell [34, 35, 51, 52]. It
is intuitive that using the white spreading codes can avoid this kind of interference.
However, the fact is properly allocating the white and gray spreading codes but the

by the set of rectangles at the bottom of Fig. 2.2(a). In order to quickly indicate the
interference between any two codes, the related code group is deﬁned as the occupied
codes in the same column of the grid representation. It means that the codes seated
at the same column can interfere with each other. For example, the code C
(1)
2,1 of MU1
can aﬀect C
(2)
4,2 of MU4, and vice versa. One should notice that the aforementioned
interference is caused by the impaired orthogonality of the frequency-domain spreading
codes over the frequency selective fading channel.
2.2 The White, Gray and Black Spreading Codes
In the proposed hierarchical 2D-spread MC-DS-CDMA, the microcell users can share
the same 2D OVSF code tree with the macrocell users. Thus, to facilitate the man-
agement of the spreading code resources, we deﬁne the white, gray and black spreading
codes in the following.
8
of macrocell users stay out of the m-BS’s coverage area. Then, based on the above
deﬁnitions, the available spreading code resources for the microcell users can now be
illustrated by Fig. 2.2(b), where the white, gray and black rectangles stand for the
white, gray and black spreading codes, respectively. Note that we call a macrocell user
the related macrocell user if he uses a code which is related to a white, gray or black
spreading code.
2.3 Problem formulation of the IA Code
Assignment Strategy
Recall that borrowing the concept from the femtocell system, it is not allowed to produce
excessive interference to the primitive macrocell system while embedding a new micro-
cell [34, 35, 51, 52]. Therefore, to avoid interfering the related macrocell users, using
the black spreading codes should be forbidden; while using the gray ones is allowable.
Nonetheless, if the gray spreading codes are not carefully selected, the performance of
the microcell users can be seriously degraded. This is because diﬀerent gray spread-
ing codes may belong to diﬀerent related code groups of the macrocell users, which
means that two gray spreading codes may be aﬀected by diﬀerent number of interfering
macrocell users. Furthermore, the macrocell base station (M-BS) may transmit signal
to diﬀerent interfering macrocell users using variant power according to their transmis-
sion rates (as explained in Sec. III.(A)). Hence, how to utilize the gray spreading codes
to further boost the spectrum eﬃciency becomes a key problem of the code assignment
strategy for the hierarchical system. To illustrate the diﬃculties and main concepts of
the IA code assignment strategy, let’s consider the following sequential events.
10
2.4 Assumptions
1. Following the concept of femtocell system [34, 35, 51, 52], the umbrella cell coor-
dination between macrocell and microcell is assumed. The M-BS and m-BS can
operate in the synchronous mode, and the downlink transmissions are considered
in this project. If the scrambling codes are needed for the cell identiﬁcation, the
same scrambling codes are assumed for both macrocell and microcell within the
same M-BS’s coverage area. Then, the orthogonality of the 2D OVSF spreading
codes between the macrocell and microcell can be preserved. Moreover, the fast
cell identiﬁcation can be achieved when a microcell user leaves its m-BS’s coverage
area and begins to be served by M-BS.
2. In order to facilitate the management and evaluation of the spreading codes for the
microcell users, m-BS can not only attain the location information of the microcell
and macrocell users but also the spreading codes’ usages of the macrocell users via
certain techniques such as subcarrier usage matrix and background interference
matrix in femtocell system [35] or geo-location database in the IEEE 802.22 [53]
and the radio environment map [54]. Also, some necessary communications and
information exchanges, i.e. the users’ locations and their usages of spreading
codes, between M-BS and m-BS can be carried out through a backbone network,
e.g. a cable or ﬁber connection [34, 35, 51, 52]. However, the development of the
required techniques and protocols, e.g. channel sensing, location detection and
information exchanges, may go beyond the scope of this project.

(X)
o is the ratio of user k’s transmission rate of R
(X)
k to the system’s
basic transmission rate of R
(X)
o ; P
(X)
o represents the transmission power corresponding
to R
(X)
o , while P
(X)
k means the maximum transmission power of a substream for user k.
3.2 Channel Model
Following the same assumptions in [4, 18, 19, 55], the subcarriers carrying the same
data bit experience the independent ﬂat fading channels. In addition, the log-normal
shadowing and empirical log-distance path loss model with the reference distance equal
to one meter are also considered [56]. Then, the channel eﬀects on each subcarrier can
be written as
H
(X)
k,i,j = h
(X)
k,i,j · (10ζ
(X)
k /10 · (d(X)k )−α
(X)
)1/2 , (3.3)
where h
(X)
k,i,j is the ﬂat Rayleigh fading along the path from X-BS to the user k with
X ∈ {M,m}; ζ (X)k is the log-normal shadowing with zero mean and standard deviation
σ(X) in the dB domain; d
(X)
k denotes the distance between X-BS and user k with a
path-loss exponent α(X).
3.3 Received Signal
For convenience, in the rest of this project, we let user k served by X1-BS be the
reference user, where X1 ∈ {M,m}. Also, users x and y represent the intra- and inter-
14

bit duration of the reference user k to the interfering user x and user y, respectively;
Δ[] = ±1 with equal probability. Comparing with the joint eﬀects of the intra- and
inter-cell MAI, the impacts of the white Gaussian noise can be ignored. Then, the
received conditional SIR (denoted by γ
(X1)
k ) for the reference user k in the substream i
16
the philosophy of the TPC mechanism is to reach γ(X1) using less transmission power.
It is occasionally that γ(X1) can not be reached by using the maximum transmission
power in each substream possibly owing to the higher level of MAI or the worse channel
conditions. In this situation, the transmission power can be adjusted by the SPA
mechanism instead of the TPC one.

(4.17)
It should be noticed that calculating the MAI coeﬃcients in (4.10) and (4.17) for the
proposed code assignment strategy doesn’t need the instantaneous channel state in-
formation. Instead, it requires: (a) the system parameters of the transmission power
and SINR targets, e.g. the P
(m)
o in (4.10) and γ(m) in (4.16); (b) the codes’ usage of
the micro- and macro-cells, e.g. the R
(m)
k and R
(M)
y in (4.17); (c) the distance from
a user to its serving and related interfering cell, e.g. the d
(m)
k and d
(M)
k in (4.16); (d)
the statistics of the channel environment, e.g. the standard deviation of lognormal
shadowing and path-loss exponent, i.e. the σ(m) and α(m) in (4.16). Note that the
related interfering cell means another cell that serves a user by using a code related
to the desired user. Designing the handshaking protocol to attain the aforementioned
information may go beyond the scope of this project. Thus, the assumption regarding
the information acquisition is made in Chapter II.(D).

Chapter 5
The IA Code Assignment Strategy for the
Hierarchical System Architecture
In the hierarchical system, the management of the spreading code resources consists of
two parts: the code assignment strategy for the macrocell and that for the microcell.
Also, the MAI coeﬃcient in the following code assignment strategy should be calcu-
lated by (4.10) when the SPA mechanism is applied, while it is (4.17) when the TPC
mechanism is applied.
5.1 Code Assignment for the Macrocell
Recall the rule of adding a microcell in the macrocell as borrowing the concept from
the femtocell system, it is not allowed to produce excessive interference to the primitive
macrocell system while embedding a microcell. Thus, when the microcell users are
forbidden to use the black spreading codes, the macrocell can simply disregard the
existence of the microcell and apply the conventional IA code assignment strategy
in [18,19] when the SPA mechanism is used or the one in [20] when the TPC mechanism
is used.
5.2 Code Assignment for the Microcell
In addition to the newly added code reassignment algorithm, the conventional code as-
signment strategy should also be modiﬁed for not producing extra MAI to the macrocell

SIR. If the required average SIR can not be reached, a new coming call will be blocked;
otherwise a code reassignment procedure will be launched for an active call at the next
stage.
Stage 4: Code Reassignment Strategy
There are two situations in which a microcell user needs code reassigned: (1) when
his white or gray spreading code in use turns black; (2) when his SIR goes below the
target value owing to the excessive amount of intra- and inter-cell MAI. Denote γ
(m)
k
and γ(m) to be the received SIR and its target value for a microcell user. TB is deﬁned as
the consecutive period of time for γ
(m)
k < γ
(m), while TR and TD are the time threshold
for the code reassignment and call dropping procedures, respectively. In principle, the
code reassignment procedure begins when γ
(m)
k < γ
(m) lasts over a consecutive period
of time TB ≥ TR. Then, the new code acquisition as well as the power adjustment are
processed by Stages 1 ∼ 3. During the code reassignment procedure, the transmission
power should be turned oﬀ, i.e. the named power-oﬀ mechanism, to avoid producing any
unnecessary MAI to the active calls. The code reassignment procedure can be ﬁnished
when the SIR target can be satisﬁed; otherwise this active call should be dropped when
TB > TD. The details of the code reassignment procedure can be found in [21].

2. P-W: The proposed method is applied to utilize the white spreading codes only.
3. C-WG: The conventional method is applied to utilize the white and gray spread-
ing codes.
4. C-WGB: The conventional method is applied to utilize the white, gray and
black spreading codes. Note that the conventional methods in [19] and [20] assign
spreading codes by only evaluating the intra-cell MAI, which means that the
white, gray and black spreading codes may be erroneously regarded equally by
the conventional methods.
5. MU-only: In this case, only macrocell users exist. In other words, the hier-
archical system architecture becomes a ﬂat one, which means that the inter-cell
interference disappears.
In the simulation, with U = 128 parallel substreams, the frequency-domain spread-
ing factor (SFf or M) is 8 and the time-domain spreading factors (SFt) are 4, 8, 16,
or 32. Each call requests a code of 8Ro (SFt = 4), 4Ro (SFt = 8), 2Ro (SFt = 16), or
Ro (SFt = 32) with a probability according to the code traﬃc pattern [1, 1, 2, 8]. A
code traﬃc pattern of [a, b, c, d] means that the times of requesting data rates 8Ro,
4Ro, 2Ro, and Ro are proportional to a : b : c : d, respectively. The data rate of each
user is ﬁxed during its call holding time. The call arrival rate (λ) of the macrocell user
is 1/2, while it is 1/10 for the microcell users. Also, for the macrocell users, the call
departure rate μ is selected from the set of {1/32, 1/64, 1/96, 1/128, 1/160}, whereas
μ is ﬁxed at 1/32 for the microcell users. To clearly indicate the traﬃc load brought
by the active calls with diﬀerent data rates, we deﬁne an eﬀective traﬃc load in the
following. With the time-domain spreading factor selected from SFt = [4, 8, 16, 32]

6.1.1 Eﬀectiveness of Using Gray Spreading Codes
Figs. 6.1 and 6.2 show the comparisons between P-WG and P-W in terms of the
(a) call admission rate and (b) dropping rate of the microcell users against various
eﬀective traﬃc loads (ρ) of the macrocell using SPA and TPC mechanisms, respectively.
Obviously, using the gray spreading codes properly can achieve a higher call admission
rate and a lower call dropping rate at the same time. Taking Fig. 6.1 for example,
compared with the curve of P-W at ρ = 5, the one of P-WG is 55% higher in the call
admission rate and 25% lower in the call dropping rate. In addition, the call admission
rate as well as the dropping rate gets saturated as the traﬃc load (the x-axis) of the
macrocell grows. This is because heavier traﬃc load of the macrocell results in less
availability of the white and gray spreading codes for the microcell users. The incurred
inter-cell MAI also limits the capacity of the microcell. Moreover, comparing Figs. 6.1
and 6.2, one can ﬁnd that the TPC mechanism can own a better performance. At
ρ = 5, the call admission rates are 79% and 66% for the TPC and SPA mechanisms,
respectively.
6.1.2 Eﬀectiveness of Evaluating the Gray Spreading Codes
In order to prove the eﬀectiveness of evaluating the gray spreading codes via the newly
deﬁned MAI coeﬃcient, it is assumed that the conventional method can recognize the
white, gray and black spreading codes so as to avoid using the black ones. Figs. 6.3
and 6.4 show the comparisons between P-WG and C-WG in terms of the (a) call
admission rate and (b) dropping rate of the microcell users against various eﬀective
traﬃc loads (ρ) of the macrocell using SPA and TPC mechanisms, respectively. As

shown in ﬁgures, it can be found that P-WG can outperform C-WG because using
C-WG, the gray spreading codes are randomly selected in stead of properly evaluated.
For instance, in Fig. 6.4(a) at ρ = 3, the call admission rate of P-WG is 5% higher
than that of C-WG. This shows the eﬀectiveness and necessity of evaluating the gray
spreading codes using the newly deﬁned MAI coeﬃcient.
6.1.3 Eﬀectiveness of the Proposed Method to the Microcell
Figs. 6.5 and 6.6 show the comparisons between P-WG and C-WGB in terms of the
(a) call admission rate and (b) dropping rate of the microcell users against various ef-
fective traﬃc loads (ρ) of the macrocell using SPA and TPC mechanisms, respectively.
As shown in the ﬁgures, P-WG can achieve a higher admission rate than C-WGB
when the traﬃc load of the macrocell is light. For example, compared with the curve
of C-WGB at ρ = 1 in Fig. 6.5, P-WG can improve the call admission rate by

6.2.1 Impacts of errors in listening to the macrocell
Fig. 6.9 shows the impacts of errors in listening to the macrocell on the average call
survival rate with respective to various number of femtocells, where the departure rate
μ is ﬁxed at 256; and the probability of listening error PLE ranges from 0.0 to 1.0. Note
that when the listening error occurs, a femtocell may wrongly assign a black code, a code
occupied by an macrocell user or a code seriously aﬀected by the macrocell. Obviously,
one can see that deploying femtocells is able to eﬃciently balance the system load.
For example, with PLE = 0, the call survival rate can increase from 0.64 to 0.99 when
20 femtocells are deployed. Furthermore, the listening error can severely degrade the
performance, especially for the cases with many femtocells. With 20 femtocells in the
macrocell, the call survival rate decreases from 0.99 to 0.71 as PLE increases from 0.0
to 1.0.

At last, the impacts of errors in listening to the macrocell were also discussed.
Considering the transmission eﬃciency, synchronization as well as abilities of inter-
ference elimination and immunity, MC-CDMA rather than OFDMA has been suggested
as the advanced transmission technology for the CR systems [22]. Inheriting from MC-
CDMA, the 2D-spread MC-DS-CDMA can similarly have good properties for the CR
applications. Thus, compared to the OFDMA counterpart, the system design can be
much more ﬂexible and simpliﬁed. For example, using 2D-spread MC-DS-CDMA, the
transmission power can be distributed over a wide frequency spectrum, which can be
helpful for the underlay CR systems to be robust against the narrow-band interference
from the primary system and to reduce the inter-system interference to the primary sys-
tem. Moreover, referring to the subcarrier deactivation in [24, 25], a certain substream
deactivation technique can also be designed to bilaterally eliminate the inter-system
interference. In addition, under the hierarchical system architecture, not only the cross-
tier interference between the macrocell and femtocells but also the co-tier interference
between the neighboring femtocells can be eliminated via the substream deactivation.
Note that in this scenario, a bulk of consecutive subcarriers should be allocated to a
substream.
Most importantly, with the aid of substream deactivation, the 2D-spread MC-CD-
CDMA can ﬁt the variant bandwidth available for the CR systems while preserving the
length and orthogonality of the 2D spreading codes. It should be emphasized that the
undamaged orthogonality can facilitate the spreading code management, especially for
the hierarchical system architecture. Furthermore, as aforementioned, the white and
gray spreading codes can be reused in each femtocell such that the spectrum eﬃciency
can be improved. Also, the system loads as well as the MAI can be balanced by

Appendix
Appendix A
In this appendix, we derive (4.5) and (4.6). It is known that |h(m)k,i,j|2 and |h(M)k,i,j|2 can be
characterized by a chi-square distributed random variable with two degrees of freedom.
Also, the same channel statistics is assumed for macrocell and microcell in Sec. III.(B).
Thus, we can let Z = |h(m)k,i,j|2 = |h(M)k,i,j|2 without loss of generality. From [58], the
probability density function of Z is given as fZ(z) = e
−z for z ≥ 0. Then, it is straight
forward to have E[Z] = 1 and E[Z2] = 2.
Similarly, we can also let W (m) = 10ζ
(m)
x /10 = eaζ
(m)
x , where a = (ln 10)/10. The
moment generating function of a zero mean Gaussian distributed random variable Q
can be written as MQ(t) = E[ecqt] = e 12 c2σ2q t2 , where c is a constant; σq is the standard
deviation of the random variable Q. With c = a, substituting t = 1 and t = 2 into
MQ(t) gives E[W (m)] = MQ(1) = e 12a2((σ(m))2 and E[(W (m))2] = MQ(2) = e2a2((σ(m))2 ,
respectively. Likewise, we can have E[W (M)] = MQ(1) = e 12a2((σ(M))2 by lettingW (M) =
10ζ
(M)
x /10 = eaζ
(M)
x . Finally, we obtain (4.5) and (4.6), respectively.
Appendix B
Here, we show that Co = E[Ψ(M)y ]/E[Ψ(m)x ] ≈ 1. Generally, the inter-cell MAI experi-
enced by a microcell user is far larger than the intra-cell MAI. Recall that Ψ
(m)
k = ψ
(m)
k +
ψ
(M)
k in Sec. III.(C). Thus, with ψ
(M)
x 
 ψ(m)x , E[Ψ(m)x ] = E[ψ(m)x ] +E[ψ(M)x ] ≈ E[ψ(M)x ].
Note that the M-BS needs larger transmission power to cover a larger area. Moreover,
